Act One

Scene One - Int. Cafe Nervosa.
Frasier is ordering his coffee at the counter.  Bebe Glazer 
approaches.

   Bebe: Well, well, well, look who's here.  It's KACL's Frasier Crane.
Frasier: And Rosemary's Bebe.

Pause.  Frasier turns back to the counter.

   Bebe: So, quite a little shake-up going on down at the station.
        I hear the new owner wants to renegotiate everyone's contract.
Frasier: [turning head] Mmm-hmm.  And before you drop another gossamer 
         hint, let me tell you that my feelings about you haven't 
         changed.
   Bebe: Fine!  Actually, I'm here to meet one of my newer clients, 
         a rising star of the Seattle airwaves.
Frasier: Oh, really, and what pathetic do-gooder have you lured into 
         your web now?

Roz enters, looking self-conscious.

   Bebe: [overly affectionate] Roz!
Frasier: [surprised] Oh, dear God.

Bebe walks over to Roz and points her toward a table.

   Bebe: You just get off your feet, little mother.  I'll fetch you       
         a nice, nourishing muffin.


Roz begins to walk toward the table, still self-conscious, trying to 
keep her back to Frasier.  Frasier follows her, glaring.

Frasier: You signed with Bebe?
    Roz: [sitting] Okay, I know, I should've told you, I just wasn't 
         in the mood for one of your lectures.
Frasier: [sitting across from her] I'm not going to give you a lecture.  
         You're entitled to choose whoever you wish to represent you.  
         Someone who's honest, or a woman whose ethics would've raised 
         eyebrows in the court of Caligula!
    Roz: Look, she's gotten me three voice-over jobs.  She may be a 
         little shifty, but she helps me put food on the table.

Bebe approaches, muffin in hand, and places it before Roz

   Bebe: One muffin.
    Roz: See?
   Bebe: [sitting; pats Roz's belly] So, Roz, I had a brainstorm last 
         night about how to turn this little bundle of joy into a big 
         bundle of cash!
    Roz: [confused] I'm going to use my baby to make money?
Frasier: [angry] Yes, it's high time the little slacker started 
         pulling his weight!
   Bebe: [to Roz] You know Doctor Clint Weber's medical show?  Well, 
         I see a daily segment called, "A Pregnant Pause: Roz Doyle's 
         Term of Endearment."  All of Seattle will share in the miracle 
         happening inside you - your joys, hopes, morning sickness, 
         sonograms, even the birth! [excited]
    Roz: [still confused] I'll give birth on the air?
   Bebe: It's radio.  Just make the noises. [laughing] Hell, I'll 
         make them myself!

A waitress approaches.

Waitress: Need anything else here?
 Frasier: Just a shower, thank you.
    Bebe: You know, Mr. Integrity, word on the street is you still 
          haven't hired anyone to negotiate this big deal for you. 
          [Frasier stands] Could it be because in your heart you know 
          you want to come back to me?
 Frasier: Yes, well if I'm taking my time it's because I'm determined 
          to make the right choice.
     Roz: Well, you're gonna need somebody good!
 Frasier: That's exactly what I intend to find, someone good!  I'm 
          going to prove to both of you it's possible to find an 
          agent who can drive a hard bargain and yet maintain the 
          highest ethical standards! 
    Bebe: [sarcastic] Happy hunting.  If things don't work out, you 
          know my number.
 Frasier: [walking out door] Still 666, is it?!

FADE OUT

Scene Two - Int. Frasier's apartment
Martin opens the front door to Niles.

  Niles: [walks in] Hello, Dad.  I believe we switched videotapes on 
         accident.
 Martin: Believe me, I noticed.
  Niles: Yes, there you go. [hands over video] At first I was dismayed.  
         I popped in the tape, and there was Charles Bronson blowing 
         away street trash, but I actually got into it.  It was quite 


         suspenseful.
 Martin: Yeah, well, that's the way Duke and I felt about "My Dinner 
         With Andre."  Talk about suspense! [fake, dramatic 
         anticipation] Will they order dessert?  Will they leave a good 
         tip? [walks to chair and sits]

Frasier enters from the direction of his bedroom.

Frasier: Oh, hello, Niles.
  Niles: Frasier, I'm sorry to trouble you about this, but could you 
         recommend another couples' therapist?
Frasier: Good Lord, not again.  What happened to Dr. Prescott?
  Niles: Oh, please, Maris had me can Dr. Prescott weeks ago.  Now she 
         wants me to fire Dr. Wilphaum.

Frasier walks in the direction of the kitchen, perhaps to get a 
drink from the wet bar.

Frasier: What's her problem with him?
  Niles: She says his criticism of her is too harsh.
Frasier: Well, some therapists can be rather blunt and hard-hitting.
         What did he say?
  Niles: He asked her to refrain from catalogue shopping during our 
         sessions. [sits on couch]
Frasier: You know Niles, if you fire every therapist who finds fault 
         with her, you're never going to make any progress.
  Niles: You're right, of course.  I'll just tell her, "We're not going 
         to change therapists, that's that." [stands]
Frasier: Good!  You know, sometimes there's nothing more rewarding 
         than sticking to a principle.  Case in point, you know, my 
         contract's coming up, and, uh, well, Bebe Glazer's been 
         angling to negotiate my new one.  Anyway, I could've done the 
         easy thing, said yes, taken the money and run, but instead, 
         I said no, and I found myself a new agent, one who's every 
         bit as smart and also ethical.
  Niles: Hmmm.

Doorbell.

Frasier: That's him now.

Frasier and Niles head toward the door.

 Martin: Well, I don't know what kinda bull that guy sold you, but 
         there's no such thing as an ethical agent.  One's just as 
         slimy as the other.

Frasier opens the door.  Ben enters.

Frasier: Hello, Ben.
    Ben: Hi.  Sorry I'm late.  I was making my last Meals on Wheels 
         delivery and I swerved to avoid a pigeon.  You know, splat 
         went the food all over the stuffed bears for the toy drive. 
         I had to run home, throw the bears in the wash, and cook 
         some more borsht for Mrs. Pavlov.
Frasier: I'm glad you made it.  Anyway, this is my brother, Doctor 
         Niles Crane.
    Ben: Hi, it's a pleasure to meet you.
  Niles: Hi. [shakes his hand, leaving] Sorry, I'm running out. 
         [turns, laughing] You're certainly a refreshing change from 
         Frasier's last agent.  I think she would have swerved to hit 
         the pigeon. [another laugh]
Frasier: [laughing] Well, she would have swerved to hit Mrs. Pavlov! 


         [closes door] Ben, I'd like you to meet my dad, Martin.

Daphne enters as Frasier leads Ben toward the couch.

Frasier: Oh, and this is his home health care worker, Daphne.  Daphne, 
         this is Ben, my new agent. 
 Daphne: [shakes Ben's hand] Oh, very nice to meet you.

Daphne sits at breakfast table.

 Martin: Well, Ben, it sounds like you're a pretty busy volunteer.
Frasier: Yes, indeed, you know, Ben just won this year's Seattle 
         Samaritan Award.
    Ben: [quickly] Well, enough about me.  Let's talk about you. 
         [gestures to couch] May I?
Frasier: Oh, please.
    Ben: [sitting] I was thinking that before we start this 
         negotiation it wouldn't hurt to raise your public profile.
Frasier: [shrug] I like the sound of that.
    Ben: Okay, here's my plan.  For a year now, I've done pro bono 
         work for the Mercer Island Zoo - you know, getting the word 
         out, creating awareness --
 Daphne: [still sitting at table] There's a zoo on Mercer Island?
    Ben: [grin] You betcha.  This'll be great PR for both of you.  
         They just bought a rare crane.  I convinced them to name it 
         after you - you know, Frasier "Crane."  So, there'll be a 
         ceremony with full newspaper and TV coverage.
Frasier: I think it's brilliant! [sits beside Ben] I'm bolstering my
         bargaining position and also helping out a plucky little 
         zoo!  I love this man!
 Daphne: [stands and walks over with bowl; places it on coffee table] 
         I think it would be fun to have a crane named after me.  I 
         just love those big pouchy mouths they scoop up the fish in.
    Ben: I think those are pelicans.
 Daphne: Oh, right. [walking back toward breakfast table] Cranes are 
         the ones who always sound like they're laughing.  No, wait, 
         I'm thinking of loons.
 Martin: That's a coincidence.
    Ben: [stands] Oh, shoot, I've got borsht on my sleeve.  Do you 
         have any club soda?
 Daphne: Oh, yes, right through here. [walking toward kitchen, Ben 
         follows]
Frasier: Help yourself.
    Ben: Thank you.

Ben and Daphne exit.

 Martin: Frasier, you told me this was a pretty big deal.  Are you 
         sure you want to send in that Mouseketeer?
Frasier: Oh, why does everybody assume that in order to be an agent 
         you have to be some unscrupulous huckster?  It is possible 
         for a good and decent man to be every bit as intimidating as 
         the toughest shark out there.
    Ben: [entering] Well, time to skedaddle.  I have to pick up a 
         friend. [walks toward door; Frasier follows] The poor guy 
         just went bankrupt, so I'm letting him bunk in my ruckus 
         room for a while.
Frasier: Well, that's awfully generous of you.
    Ben: Well, he's not just a friend, he's a client.

Ben lets himself out, and Frasier closes the door and looks back at 
Martin shrugging.


FADE TO:

BYE BYE BIRDY

Scene Three - Ext. Mercer Island Zoo.
The Director of the zoo leads Frasier into a tent, where the buffet is.  
The bird is also in this tent in a small cage.

Director: Um, and then the press and the board members will join us 
          in here for a buffet.
 Frasier: So I finish my speech, and then I give Mr. Twembly here the 
          cue and he brings out this marvelous creature.
 Twembly: [kneeling beside cage] Just give me the signal.
  Martin: [enters] Aw, this is great!  Look at this!  Turkey, chicken 
          wings! [leans down toward crane] Hey!  Gotta make you a 
          little nervous, huh?
  Daphne: [walks up to Frasier] [hushed voice] Look!  It's Toffee 
          Macintosh, from the news!  I just love her!
 Frasier: Oh, yes, really?
  Toffee: [approaching] Frasier.
 Frasier: Toffee.  Thank you for covering us.
  Toffee: [laugh] Aw, you know my motto, "If it happens in Seattle, 
          it's news to me." [laugh]
 Frasier: Listen, I'd like you to meet one of your biggest fans, 
          Daphne Moon.
  Daphne: Hello.  I just love the way you get all somber when you 
          describe a flood or a murder, then you cheer right up the 
          minute you're done!  Makes me think, well, if she can get 
          over it, so can I.
  Toffee: That's what I'm here for.
     Ben: [enters] Ready to greet your public?
 Frasier: Well, uh, yes!  Come on, Dad!
  Martin: [eating] All right, I'll be there in a sec.

All but Martin walk toward the seating area.

The outdoors, grassy area is set up for Frasier's program.  In front 
of a large sign that says "Mercer Island Zoo" is a podium.  In front 
of this is a row of chairs for the audience.

Roz sits to the side smiling brightly with a monkey in her lap.  
Bebe is beside her.  Several cameras are on them.

   Bebe: Why, you see what maternal instincts this woman has?  Even 
         little Bobo here can sense it.
Frasier: [approaching Bebe and Roz] Well, I can see I'm not the only 
         one getting some publicity today.
    Ben: [joins them] Frasier, they want to start pretty soon.
Frasier: Oh, Ben, Ben, just a moment, I'd like you to meet some 
         people.  This is Bebe and Roz.  This is Ben, my new agent.

Improv hellos.

    Ben: Hey, talk about your small worlds.  Turns out Mr. Twembly 
         and I both sang tenor for the same choir back home in Salt 
         Lake City.  Nice meeting you ladies.
   Bebe: [evil laugh; very sarcastic] Well, when there's a dirty job 
         to be done, you can't go wrong with a Mormon.
Frasier: [indignant] Scoff all you like, the man is a genius at PR.

The program starts.  The audience in the front row, from left to 
right, is: Bebe, Roz, Daphne, and a few places over from them, Ben. 


Ben looks excited.

Twembly: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.  On behalf of the 
         Mercer Island Zoo, I'd like to welcome our very special 
         guest, Doctor Frasier Crane. [applause]
Frasier: [steps up to podium] Thank you, Mr. Twembly.  I suppose it's 
         only appropriate that the zoo has called upon me to introduce 
         you all to its newest resident.  You see, he happens to be a 
         relative of mine. [laugh]

Bored looks from Bebe and Roz.

CUT TO:
Martin is alone in the tent with the Crane, still eating.

 Martin: Hey, what're you lookin' at?  This is human food.  You don't 
         see me lookin' at your bird food, do you? [turns away from 
         bird and toward the buffet; bird bites the seat of Martin's 
         pants; turns back around] What do you think you're doing, huh?  
         That's not very nice! [shakes his cane at the bird; cane 
         catches on cage, opening gate; bird jumps out]. Oh, wait, 
         wait, no, no, no, wait, where you goin'?!

CUT TO:

Frasier is at the podium speaking.  As he speaks, the bird runs behind 
him.  Then, Martin runs by in hot pursuit of the crane, shaking his arm 
at the bird.  They exit to the right.  Frasier is entirely oblivious.

Frasier: ...We're both tall and have distinctive profiles, we've both 
         been known to winter in Mexico, and let's not forget our 
         voices.  Is there anything as stirring as the crane's 
         majestic cry?
 Martin: [o.s] Yeyaaaaaaaa!  Get this thing off me! [hobbles in, 
         holding ear]
Frasier: Dad, are you all right?  What's happening? [uproar; bird runs 
         behind him, chased by several men] My goodness!  What is 
         going on! [turns toward audience, attempting to cover] Oh, 
         I'm sorry!  Nothing to be alarmed about!  Just a little family 
         squabble!

The audience is in uproar; Frasier rushes to Martin's aid.

End of Act One

Act Two

Scene One - Int. Frasier's apartment.
Focus on TV.  Toffee Macintosh is reporting in front of the chaos of 
the crane ordeal.

 Toffee: In a gruesome incident this afternoon, the Mercer Island Zoo 
         seemed more like the Island of Doctor Moreau....

Shift to: Living room.  Martin is sitting in chair with Frasier to 
his right and Daphne behind him, all watching the TV.

 Toffee: [v.o]...as a distinguished senior citizen was savagely 
         attacked by Frasier Crane, Bird of Prey.
Frasier: I can't watch any more of this.
 Martin: Well, that makes us even.  I can't hear any of it.
Frasier: Oh, you weren't hurt that badly!  Of course, you wouldn't 
         know that to listen to Toffee.  She makes the whole thing 


         sound like a disaster!
 Daphne: I know. [brightens] But did you see the way she could smile 
         right after?

Frasier glares at Daphne, and she rushes away.

Frasier: [sitting on couch] Lord, this entire affair's turned into a 
         PR nightmare!
 Martin: Well, it's your own fault for hiring Howdy Doody as your 
         agent!

Doorbell.

Frasier: [walking to door] Dad, I'm sorry.  Ben had no idea that bird 
         was going to attack you.  Besides, there is a school of 
         thought that says there's no such thing as bad publicity.

Frasier opens door. Niles enters, laughing wickedly.

  Niles: Frasier, I was just hearing about you on the car radio.  The 
         deejay was offering a cash prize for the best Frasier Crane 
         joke.  Wait, what was the front-runner?  Oh, yes, how can you 
         tell Frasier the Crane's a psychiatrist?
Frasier: [closing door] I can't wait to hear.
  Niles: He ignores what you say then sticks you with a large bill.

Laughs all around, except Frasier.

  Niles: [walking toward Martin's chair as Frasier goes to his 
         bookshelves] You must excuse my jolly mood, but Maris 
         was over tonight for our weekly conjugal visit.
 Martin: [clearly disgusted] Eeww, Jeez.
  Niles: I've never seen her look so seductive.  She wore a clingy 
         gown, crimson lipstick, even earrings, which she tends to 
         avoid as they make her head droop.  She pulled me down upon 
         the bed and began playing my spine like a zither.  And then, 
         just as things were heating up, she renewed her request that 
         I dismiss Doctor Wilphaum.  So tremulous with desire was I 
         that I almost relented, but then I remembered your advice, 
         Frasier, and I said I wouldn't fire the good doctor - at which 
         point Maris told me I wouldn't be firing anything else in 
         the foreseeable future!!  And she left!
Frasier: Now, now, now, Niles, withholding sex may be just as difficult 
         on Maris!  She may crumble first!
  Niles: Are you serious?  One hour of passion can sustain her for 
         months.  She stores it up like some sexual camel.
Frasier: [defensive] All right, Niles.  You know that my advice was 
         solid.
  Niles: I hope you're right. [phone rings] I'll get it.  Hello?  
         Oh, hello Roz. [to Frasier] It's Roz.
Frasier: Thank you. [takes phone] Roz, hello.  Yes, what is it?
  Niles: [pointing at flowers on table] That's a striking arrangement.
 Martin: It's from Bebe.  After what happened today, she's trying to 
         woo him back.
  Niles: Birds of Paradise, I suppose that's her idea of floral irony.
Frasier: [on phone] Yes, well, ah, thanks for the warning, Roz.
 Martin: What's that about?
Frasier: Oh, well, it turns out the station manager won't be 
         renegotiating the contracts himself.  Apparently he's brought 
         in one of these hired guns stations use to reduce costs. 
         Some fellow nicknamed "The Hammer."
  Niles: [examining flowers] I'm assuming they call him "The Hammer"
         because he's tough.
Frasier: No, Niles, because he loves the lyrics of Oscar Hammerstein!


 Martin: You know, Frasier, if I were you, I'd give Bebe a call.  
         Now, I'm no fan of hers, either, but this is a pretty big 
         negotiation.

Doorbell.

Frasier: [walks toward door] No, Dad, I am sticking with Ben. 
         Oh, sure, maybe Bebe could use her dark arts to get me a 
         dollar or two more, but, you know, my integrity is worth 
         more than that. [opens door] Hello, Ben.
    Ben: Hey, big guy.  How ya doing?
Frasier: Well, uh, fine.
    Ben: Good.  Boy, people sure are being mean about this!  I was 
         just listening to the radio on the way over.  Ouch.  But I 
         always say, if life hands you a lemon, make lemonade.
Frasier: That's the spirit. [hopefully] So you've got some sort of
         damage-control plan?
    Ben: You betcha.  I got a way to turn this whole mess around and 
         show that station manager just what you're made of.
Frasier: Excellent!  But you won't be dealing with him.  You'll be 
         dealing with this free-lancer they call "The Hammer."
    Ben: Hoo-boy. [sits]
 Martin: You've gone up against him?
    Ben: Oh yes, and I had to take a pretty firm line with him.
Frasier: Well, I'm glad to hear that.
    Ben: Yeah, I finally said, "You better just clean up your language, 
         Pal.  I walked out on that Mamet play, I can walk out on you."
Frasier: [hesitates] So, uh, about your plan.
    Ben: Yeah, right! Um, I think there's a way to show people you're 
         laughing right along with them.  You do a photo op where you, 
         Seattle's best-loved psychiatrist, give the crane therapy. 
         You know, you sit in a chair with a pad on your lap, and the 
         crane - properly sedated, of course - sits on... [pulls 
         out a miniature psychiatrist's couch] THIS.

Skeptical looks exchanged.

  Niles: Where on earth did you find a couch that size?
    Ben: Oh, I built it myself.  I have a little workshop in my attic 
         where I make toys for the neighborhood kids.
 Martin: Look at you!  Agent, samaritan... elf.
Frasier: Dad, I like this idea!  It's droll... and self-mocking.  It's 
         the perfect way to turn a PR embarrassment into a triumph!
    Ben: Great.  I'll set up the photo op.  And don't you be nervous 
         about The Hammer, all right?  Because I can be a pretty tough
         customer myself!
Frasier: [walking him to the door] I'm sure you can!  I know you're 
         gonna go in there and you're gonna give him hell!
    Ben: Boy, I love show business, but I'll never get used to the 
         cursing!

Ben opens door and leaves.

FADE TO:

MAYBE IT WAS A DISGRUNTLED FORMER ZOO WORKER

Scene Two - Int. Café Nervosa
Frasier walks toward and sits at Niles's table.  He has a large white 
bandage on his forehead.  Waitress approaches.

 Frasier: [quietly] Latte, please.


Waitress: Hey, didn't I see your picture in the paper today?  There 
          was a big bird chasing you around a little couch!
 Frasier: [glares] Latte, please.

Waitress leaves.

  Niles: Well, I think you have a real case against the maker of 
         those crane sedatives.
Frasier: Thank you for the sympathy!
  Niles: You're not the only one going through a rough patch.  Maris 
         has strained my libido to the breaking point!
Frasier: Niles, you can't give in!
  Niles: I'm getting desperate!  This morning, I found myself flirting 
         with my manicurist!
Frasier: The one with the thing on her face?
  Niles: I told you, I'm desperate!
Frasier: What can be keeping Ben?
  Niles: After all this, you're still using Ben?  Shouldn't you just 
         go back to Bebe?
Frasier: [points finger] I see what you're doing.  You think if I bail 
         out on my principles it gives you an excuse to go crawling 
         back to Maris.  Well, I'm not going to do it.  Ben may have
         made some mistakes, but he is a good man, and he's going to 
         make me a good deal!

Gil has just entered the Cafe.  He's standing in the doorway in a 
state of shock.

Frasier: Oh, Gil!  How'd it go with the Hammer?
    Gil: You've never seen such cold, dead eyes!  It was like 
         bargaining with Nosferatu.  My salary's been slashed!
Frasier: Oh, I'm sorry.

Waitress approaches.

Waitress: Can I do anything else for you?
   Niles: [holding up biscotti] Yes, would you mind nibbling on this
          provocatively?
 Frasier: Niles! [to waitress] We're fine, thank you. [waitress leaves]
     Gil: I wish you good luck, Frasier.  I don't see anybody squeezing 
          blood from that stone.

Bebe and Roz enter, both waving their hands in the air.

   Bebe: [triumphantly] Lattes for everyone!
    Gil: [shocked] Dear God, don't tell me you did well!
    Roz: [thrilled] I got a weekly spot on Clint Weber's show and a 
         thirty percent raise!
    Gil: How on earth did you get all that?
   Bebe: [evil laugh] Oh, we go way back, the Hammer and I.  I know 
         where the bodies are buried. [pause] Usually, that's just a 
         metaphor.
    Roz: So, Gil, what'll you have?  My treat?
    Gil: I think I'll be happier at the losers' table with Aunt Penny, 
         the story lady. [calls offstage] Penny!  Don't put that flask   
         away! [moves off]
Frasier: Well, congratulations, Roz.  Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm 
         waiting for Ben.  We have to discuss our bargaining position.
   Bebe: Oh, there're so many to choose from.  Kneeling, crawling, 
         groveling.  I'm sure he'll pick the right one.

Bebe and Roz leave for the counter to order.


Frasier: [muttering] God, she is obnoxious!
  Niles: [watches her] Mmmm.  Though alluring, in a buxom, bad-girl 
         kind of way.
Frasier: Oh, shut up, you horny idiot! [pause] My bandage seems a 
         little loose. If Ben gets here, just tell him I went in to 
         fix it. [leaves for bathroom]

Bebe watches Frasier go toward restroom.

CUT TO:
Int. restroom
Frasier enters and closes the door. He walks to the mirror to examine 
his bandage.  Bebe opens the door and enters right behind him.

   Bebe: Frasier, we have to talk.
Frasier: [angry] Are you aware that you are in the men's room?
   Bebe: Oh, please, if I paid attention to signs with little pictures 
         on them... I'd never get a parking space. [closes door] Now, 
         it's time we both dropped the masks.  You need me, and I want 
         you back.  Just sign this contract. I'll cut you a deal 
         that'll make Roz's look like lunch money.
Frasier: Isn't there a zebra carcass somewhere you should be hovering 
         over?
   Bebe: You wanna see a carcass, chum? [grabs Frasier and faces him 
         toward mirror] Look in the mirror.  Look what you've let that 
         man do to you.  Your face is riddled with bird bites, your 
         name's a punchline, and your career is five minutes from 
         over, and he's only been your agent for three days!

We see Frasier in the mirror.  He holds a hand up to his mouth, 
looking horrified at "what he has become."

   Bebe: Send him in against the Hammer and you'll be doing fog reports 
         from a lighthouse in Puget Sound! [turns him around toward her 
         almost violently] Admit it!  You're scared!
Frasier: [desperately] All right, maybe I am scared!  But... there is 
         one thing that is stronger than fear!  Faith!  Faith that a 
         good man with a good heart can make a good deal! [pushes her 
         back] Now get out of my way!
   Bebe: No, I won't let you!  D'you know what I've been through 
         building your career?  I have been to hell and back so often 
         I have frequent flier miles! [runs to him, grabs the lapels 
         of his coat and pulls him toward her] You owe me a second 
         chance!
Frasier: Take your tentacles off of me! [shoves her away, rushes out]
   Bebe: [calling after him] Please! I won't be the same Bebe you 
         knew!  I'll change!  I'll be like Ben! [pause] Only competent! 

At the table, Roz is nibbling on Niles's biscotti.  He has his hand 
on her shoulder and is holding the plate up to catch crumbs.  He's 
watching with a dazed, dreamy look on his face.  He looks up when he 
sees Frasier and Bebe emerge from the men’s room.

   Bebe: [chasing Frasier] Darling, you forgot to sign!
  Niles: [starting to stand] Oh, you reconciled.  Congratulations, 
         I'll just be off to Maris's.
Frasier: Sit down, Niles! I'm still with Ben.

Ben enters in a black trench coat.

Frasier: Ben!
    Ben: Sorry I'm late.  I took my son's troop on a nature hike and 
         little Noah got a bee sting, so I rushed him to the emergency 


         room, then I came straight here.
Frasier: It's all right, we've got five minutes.
    Ben: Excuse me. [leaves]
    Roz: Now, Frasier, you know Bebe can make you a better deal.
  Niles: Listen to Roz.
   Bebe: Listen to Niles.
Frasier: I'm not listening to any of you!  My God, am I the last man 
         on God's green earth that's still willing to stand up for a 
         principle?

Ben comes back sans trench coat.  He is wearing a boy scout uniform, 
complete with shorts and red tie/sash.

    Ben: Should we go over those demands for ol' Mr. Hammer?

There is a long pause.  Frasier looks very regretful.  Before he even 
begins speaking, Niles takes out his cell phone and dials.

Frasier: [hesitantly] Ben, could we have a word?
  Niles: [into phone] Hello, Maris!

Ben and Frasier go to corner booth.

Frasier: Uh, listen, I don't think it's news to you that things haven't 
         been going so smoothly with us, and I think I'd feel more 
         comfortable with Bebe.  I know this must seem a bit of a shock 
         to you, but, ah-
    Ben: [laugh] No, I saw this coming.  Yesterday, when you threw that 
         little couch at me, I thought to myself, "This is not a happy 
         client."
Frasier: Thanks for understanding.

Frasier and Ben stand, Ben leaves to get his coat, Frasier walks over 
to where Bebe is standing beside the counter and Roz is sitting at the
closest table.  Niles has just closed his cell phone and is now rushing 
out the door.

  Niles: [o.s] Taxi!

Frasier goes to stand by Bebe at the counter.

   Bebe: [handing over paper and pen; almost affectionately] Sign 
         right here, darling.
Frasier: You know, I'm holding you to that promise about changing.  
         I won't stand for any more shady doings.
   Bebe: [almost sincerely] Those days are all behind me.
Frasier: Once you've worked out this thing with the Hammer, maybe you 
         can see what you can do about defusing this bird situation.

Ben walks back over with his trench coat.

    Ben: Oh, you don't have to worry about the crane anymore.  The 
         poor thing choked to death this morning.  They have no idea
         who would feed a bird a jawbreaker.  Bye, now. 

Ben leaves.  Frasier turns slowly to Bebe.

Frasier: [hopefully and fearfully at once] Is there any chance it 
         wasn't you?
   Bebe: Oh, darling... [looks around, trying to come up with an answer 
         he'll be satisfied with] There's always a chance.
Frasier: [ponders] I can live with that. [signs papers]


FADE OUT

END OF ACT TWO

Credits:

Frasier walks into his apartment to see Daphne, holding a pad wearing 
dark, Sigmund Freud-ish glasses, sitting on the coffee table beside 
Eddie, who is lying on the little toy couch, also on the coffee table.  
She puts a finger to her lips, gesturing for Frasier to be quiet.  She 
writes on the pad.  Frasier goes to his bookcase, gets a book, walks 
over, and hits Daphne in the head.  She laughs as he walks away.
