GUYS AND DOLLS

Act One. 

Scene One - Frasier's apartment.
Frasier opens the door to Niles.

Frasier: Niles.
  Niles: I'm sorry to drop by unannounced, but I need your help. 
Frasier: Of course.  Sherry?
  Niles: Please.  As you know, ever since I moved into the Montana
         I've been angling to meet our most famous tenant: Esmeralda
         Bing, the Walnut Queen.  Well, I finally cornered her in the
         ornamental garden, by the wishing well, and I felt very 
         pleased with myself - that is until the Walnut Queen invited
         me to a ball.  Now I have a problem.
Frasier: [sarcastic:] Yes, your life has become an operetta.
  Niles: [smiles at the quip] No, it's a charity ball.  And when I 
         say invited, I mean she let me buy a table for ten at five
         thousand dollars.  I've until Sunday to sell eight five 
         hundred dollar tickets...
Frasier: [picking up cheque book:] Say no more.  It's a bit steep, 
         but if it's for charity...
  Niles: Thank you Frasier, it is a very worthy cause.
Frasier: Alright, who should I make this out to?
  Niles: [Frasier writes as Niles speaks] The Esmeralda... Bing...
         International... Doll Museum.

Frasier puts his cheque book away and rips the cheque up.

Frasier: You do have a problem!


  Niles: I thought you prided yourself on supporting the arts!
Frasier: The arts, Niles, not the crafts!

At this point Daphne & Martin come out the bedroom and into the main 
room, arguing as usual.

 Martin: I told you, I can't do it now.  Sherry's taking me out for 
         our third-month anniversary, and I've got to get a new sport
         coat.
 Daphne: You cannot skip your exercises again - you skipped them
         yesterday. 
 Martin: This is the only time Sherry can go shopping with me and I
         can't go without her.  There isn't a woman alive with her
         fashion sense! 
  Niles: [aside to Frasier:] Carmen Miranda having passed on!
 Daphne: I should think having a lady friend would make you exercise
         more, not less.  I don't mean to be indelicate, but a man in
         your condition who wants to enjoy certain, shall we say, 
         indoor sports, should take steps to make sure that cranky old
         Mr. Hip doesn't, shall we say, let down the team, if you get
         my meaning?
 Martin: Don't you worry about me.  I may not be the rookie of the 
         year any more but I can still move around the bases!

Martin opens the door to leave and bumps into Roz who is standing 
there.

    Roz: Oh hey, Martin.
  Niles: [aside to Frasier:] Oh look, a scout from the majors.
 Martin: I'll see you later, I gotta run. [leaves]
Frasier: Oh, this is a surprise.
    Roz: [happy:] Big news.  Gertie Oldson is leaving the station.
 Daphne: What, from "Gertie's Grotbag"?  I love that show.
Frasier: Oh please, that homily-spouting Hausfrau?  It's the most 
         embarrassing thing on the air.  So, she finally got canned, 
         eh?
    Roz: No, she got a million-dollar TV deal.
Frasier: [chokes on his sherry, then:] Well, good news for Gertie 
         and for the many atheists who will welcome this new proof 
         of their theory. 
    Roz: Anyway, they're auditioning people for her time slot and... 
         I'm going to go for it.
Frasier: What do you mean - your own show?
 Daphne: Roz, that's exciting.
  Niles: [slyly:] And what better way to celebrate an exciting new 
         career move than spending this Sunday at a swanky society 
         ball? [takes out tickets]
Frasier: Drop it, Niles!  Of course, this comes as a little surprise.
 Daphne: Yeah, I never knew you were interested in getting your own 
         show.
    Roz: Well, it's the whole reason I got into radio.  I mean, I had 
         my own show in college and when I started working at the 
         station I kinda got stuck on the producing side.
Frasier: What kind of show did you have in mind?
    Roz: I thought I'd talk about stuff I know: the singles life in 
         Seattle, dating, fashion, where to meet available men...
  Niles: Well, if you're looking for an event which will be crawling 
         with attractive single men, [takes tickets out] this 
         particular ga...
Frasier: [angry:] Niles! 
    Roz: Anyway Frasier, I hope that you'll support me on this.
Frasier: Well, I'd hate to lose you, but of course I'll support you.
    Roz: [happy:] Oh thank you, Frasier, you're the best.


Frasier: [modest:] Well...
    Roz: Listen, as long as I've got you all here - I'm putting 
         together an audition and I could use people to pretend to be 
         callers...
Frasier: [happily:] We'd be glad to help. 
 Daphne: Sounds like fun.
    Roz: Alright, I'll come back tonight.  Oh and Daphne, I need at 
         least one spicy call.  Could you pretend to be a woman who
         doesn't believe in sex without love, but just feels so horny 
         sometimes she wants to jump anything in pants?
 Daphne: [sarcastic:] Well, I'll try.  And while I'm at it, I'll see 
         if I can fake a British accent!

Roz and Daphne laugh. So does Niles, but out of Daphne's sight 
his knees wobble, and he clutches onto his brother.

FADE OUT

ANY PORT MANTEAU

IN A STORM

Scene Two - Apartment
Later that night: Roz, Niles, Daphne and Frasier are sitting around 
the dining room table.  Niles is holding a microphone connected to 
a tape recorder.  Roz begins her audition tape.

    Roz: [into microphone:] Good afternoon, Seattle.  I'm Roz Doyle 
         and this is "Love Matters."  Today we're chatting with 
         merchant seaman Steve Barron, from Billingham.  Tell me 
         Steve, what do you look for in an ideal date?
Frasier: [normal posh voice:] When my shipmates and I pull into port 
         after several weeks at sea...
    Roz: Cut! [stops tape:] Sorry Frasier, but you don't sound like a 
         merchant seamen.
Frasier: Oh, let's try again, alright?
    Roz: [starts tape:] So, Steve, what do you look for in an ideal 
         date?
Frasier: [salty voice:] When my shipmates and I pull into port 
         after several weeks at sea, the first thing we do is... 
  Niles: [taking the mike, salty voice:] ...head for the antique sale!

He laughs.  Roz turns off the tape.

Frasier: Fine, smarty pants.  Well, you play Steve then.
    Roz: Never mind, let's just go on to my next idea.  Daphne?  OK, 
         you be the girlfriend of a couple who wants to spice things 
         up in the bedroom.  Niles, will you be her boyfriend?
  Niles: [quickly:] Yes. 
    Roz: OK. [starts tape:] I'm here with Fred and Patty.  Tell me, 
         you two, what made you think that your sex life needs a 
         little jump start?
 Daphne: It's all his fault.  He just seems to have lost interest in 
         me.  I've done everything I can to entice him.  I've... 
         served dinner wearing nothing but high heels and an apron; 
         I've called him at the office and talked dirty; and last 
         night when he came home I was lying in bed wearing a whipped 
         cream teddy! But, [angry:] did he care?  No!
    Roz: And none of this turns you on, Fred?

Niles cannot answer.  He just stares into nothingness, reliving their 
imaginary past experiences.  Roz gets impatient.


    Roz: Fred? 
  Niles: [comes out of trance:] That's nothing, you should hear the 
         other things that don't turn me on!  Tell me about it, Patty.
    Roz: Let's cut to the chase.  Patty, men are like fish: when you 
         first hook 'em they wriggle around like crazy, but once you 
         finally reel them in they just lie there with that glassy 
         look. 
  Niles: That's terrible advice.
    Roz: No, it isn't.
  Niles: Yes, it is, you have no idea how Fred really feels about 
         Daphne... Patsy.
 Daphne: Patty.
  Niles: Patty!
    Roz: This is pointless.
Frasier: No, Roz, you're doing just fine. 
    Roz: [angry:] No, I was terrible!  I wasn't helpful, I wasn't 
         smart... I wasn't even sassy!
Frasier: Well, perhaps not sassy but you were simply saucy, that 
         borders on sassy. 

Frasier and Roz enters the kitchen as Martin enters the living room 
from the front door.

 Daphne: Hello, Mr. Crane.  How was your romantic evening with Sherry?
 Martin: Oh, it was fine. [laughs, but:] Er, hey Daph', how about 
         getting that exercise mat out, we'll do some stretches, eh?
 Daphne: Can't right now, I'm helping Roz with her audition tape.
 Martin: [impatient:] Well, how long's it going to take?
 Daphne: What are you so eager for? [realising:] Oh, I get the 
         picture.  Not too limber with Sherry this evening, were we?  
         Two hips but no hooray? [laughs]
 Martin: Very funny!  Well, you haven't exactly been burning it up in 
         the romance department either.
 Daphne: [injured] What do you know about my love life?

At this moment Niles accidentally slips on the play button.

 Daphne: [on tape:] I was lying in bed wearing a whipped cream teddy. 
         But did he care... 

Niles switches it off with sorrowful gestures as Daphne looks 
embarrassed to a confused Martin.  

Reset to: Kitchen
Meanwhile, Frasier is consoling Roz.

Frasier: It takes some time to get the hang of it at first.  But I 
         mean, you should have heard my audition tape! [laughs] I was 
         so inept it was incredible.
    Roz: [remembering:] That's true! 
Frasier: Oh.  Oh, you heard it?  Well, then you see that... [mutters]
    Roz: [laughing:] There was a bootleg floating around the station 
         for months! 
Frasier: Yes, well fine, so you get my point then...
    Roz: People still play it at parties!
Frasier: [angry:] Alright, Roz. 

Reset to: Living Room
Roz and Frasier enter as Martin is sitting on his Barcalounger.

 Martin: So, hey Roz, I hear you're trying out for a new job?
    Roz: Yes, as a matter of fact I am.  And you can really help me 
         with my demo.


 Martin: What do I do?
    Roz: I just want an honest answer.  I want to talk to you about 
         first dates.
 Martin: OK.
  Niles: [laughs:] Are you sure dad's the best candidate for this 
         particular subject? [Frasier laughs with him]
 Martin: [easily:] Quick survey: how many Crane men here with a 
         girlfriend? 

Martin raises his hand; Frasier and Niles stop laughing.

 Martin: No, no, keep 'em up while I count. 
Frasier: [backing up:] Alright!
    Roz: Great.  OK Frasier, start the tape. [he does; into it:] 
         Alright, we're here with Martin and we're talking about 
         first dates.  Martin, tell me some of the tricks you use to 
         impress women.
 Martin: [modest:] Hmmm, well I'm sorry to disappoint you, Roz, but I 
         really don't know any tricks.  I mean, if a woman agreed to 
         go out with me, I'd er, well, I'm not there to impress her 
         or to play cool.  I'm there because I want to know her; er, 
         what she thinks; er, what she likes, so that if I'm lucky 
         enough to get another date I can plan something that I know 
         she'd like to do.  I guess I'm still old-fashioned or 
         something, but I think you should treat a woman like a queen. 

Daphne and Roz look at each other and give a sigh of wonder, hope and 
freshness.

 Martin: [to kids:] Bow to the master, boys, bow to the master.

Scene Three - KACL
Later that week Frasier and Bulldog are in the foyer outside the 
manager's office.  Bulldog is there and notices Bebe who has just 
walked in with a crowd.

Bulldog: Hey, Bebe!
   Bebe: Bulldog Briscoe, my absolute favourite client.
Frasier: Hello, Bebe.
   Bebe: And Frasier Crane - alert the judges, we have a tie!
Frasier: Oh my goodness, what a flock.  These all yours?
   Bebe: Yes.  The minute I heard about the auditions I piled all my 
         hottest new discoveries into the van.
Frasier: You brought them in a van?
   Bebe: I call it my "Bebe Stars Of Tomorrow Tour." [to flock:] 
         People, I want you to meet Frasier Crane.
Frasier: Hello.
   Bebe: [selling him:] The most caring and kindest client I've ever 
         had.  Frasier, this is Professor Pete, the human 
         encyclopedia.  Ask him anything, he can't be stopped. 
Frasier: Oh, alright.  Explain Freud's theory of the superego.
   Pete: [as if reading textbook:] Sigmund Freud, noted psychiatrist, 
         was born in Vienna. [stops]
Frasier: [confused:] That's not what I asked.
   Pete: He believed dreams had secret meanings. [stops]
   Bebe: [covering up:] He just pulls it out of the air.  But, if 
         it's a raucous political debate you want, meet newlyweds 
         Hank and Hannah Finch.
Frasier: Hello, Hank.
   Bebe: [selling them:] He's a right-wing Baptist preacher, she's a 
         fun-loving bisexual!  Conflicts?  You bet!  Have you ever 


         seen such talent?
Frasier: [laughs:] Well..
   Bebe: [takes Frasier aside:] Ugh, they're pathetic! 

At this moment Roz bursts out of the manager's office with excitement. 
She rushes over to Frasier.

    Roz: [excited:] It went really well! 
Frasier: Oh Roz, I'm so excited for you. 
    Roz: You know what he actually said?  At this moment I am the 
         candidate to beat.
Frasier: Oh congratulations, Roz...
    Roz: OK, I'm going to get set up for the show, I'm so excited. 
         [exits]
Frasier: [half-heartedly:] OK. 
   Bebe: Well, ra-ra for little Roz. 
Frasier: Yes well, I'm really thrilled for her, I am, but... [pauses:] 
         God knows where I'm going to find another producer.  I feel 
         so in sync with her.
   Bebe: You know, Hank Finch produced hygiene films in the army.
Frasier: No, Bebe, I don't think so.  Ah, I'm not proud to admit this, 
         but there's a small part of me that hopes she won't get the 
         job.  God, I feel guilty just saying that.
   Bebe: [pleased:] You're so good, everything makes you feel guilty. 
         I'm so proud to represent you.  You're like a modern day... 
         what's his name? [to Pete:] Pete, famous German doctor - 
         built a hospital in Africa, Albert something?
   Pete: Hang on.
Frasier: [jumping to it:] Schweitzer.
   Pete: [positive:] No.

As Pete fiddles with this "problem," Bebe and Frasier look at each 
other in disgust.

End Of Act One. [Time: 11:08]

Act Two. 

Scene One - KACL
Frasier is just finishing his radio show.

Frasier: [on air:] And that is it for our show today.  But before 
         I sign off, this final note to Carla who called us earlier 
         from the planet "Fripton."  The technical term for your 
         condition, which eluded me earlier, is "Schizophrenoform 
         Disorder." [off air:] Or in layman's terms...

Frasier burbles his lips with his finger like a madman.  As Roz 
enters the booth, she notices a gathering outside.

    Roz: Hey, what's going on out here?
Frasier: Good Lord, is it someone's birthday?
Bulldog: [enters:] Hey Roz, I hate to be the one to break it to you, 
         but Brenda from the newsroom got the job.
    Roz: Brenda?
Frasier: [unhappy for her:] Oh, Roz.
Bulldog: It's total BS.  Listen, er, if you need a little comforting 
         later... [shouts and runs off:] Hey Brenda, alright! [comes 
         back:] I'm there for you. [leaves to Brenda]
Frasier: Roz, I'm so sorry.
    Roz: [covering up:] Oh hell, I'll be OK.  Guess I better go 
         congratulate the winner.
Frasier: Right.


Frasier goes into the KACL corridor as Roz exits.  He spots Bebe.

Frasier: Bebe, did you hear what happened to Roz?
   Bebe: [delighted:] Yes, no need to thank me, darling.
Frasier: [confused:] What are you talking about?
   Bebe: I spoke to the station manager - I told him just how you'd
         feel if he gave Roz the job.
Frasier: [angry:] You did what?! [paranoid:] In here.

Frasier and Bebe enter the booth.

   Bebe: I said that Frasier Crane wasn't about to work for a station 
         that would steal his producer away.  A bluff, of course, but 
         he crumbled like a matzo.
Frasier: Oh, how could you?!  I told you that I didn't want to lose 
         Roz, but I didn't mean for you to sabotage her!
   Bebe: You didn't?  Oh no, what a horrible misunderstanding. 
         [pauses:] Wink! [laughs]
Frasier: I mean it!
   Bebe: Oh, I see.  So when you said in that off-handed way that you 
         hoped Roz wouldn't get the job... I totally misinterpreted 
         you. [pauses:] Wink! [laughs]
Frasier: Will you stop winking!  My God, I could never want such a 
         thing!  There's got to be some way I can still reverse this! 

At this moment Roz enters the booth.

    Roz: [sarcastically:] Oh that was fun, I got to watch Brenda sign 
         her new contract! 
   Bebe: Roz, I think what they did to you is monstrous. [Frasier 
         can't believe her lies] I wish I could stay here and console 
         you, but my people are waiting for me in the van.  I hope 
         someone cracked a window! [exits]
Frasier: Listen Roz, this is something we need to talk about...
    Roz: Oh Frasier, I know what you're going to say: that I tried my 
         best, that I deserved it.  I'm fine with this, really.  Yeah, 
         I gave it a shot, that's what counts.  I didn't get it.  
         It's not like.... [bursting into tears:] my life is over!

Roz, overridden in tears, takes refuge in Frasier's chest.  Some time 
later she manages to get herself together and pulls away, still upset.

    Roz: [upset:] Oh look at me, I'm so busy feeling sorry for myself 
         I haven't even thanked you for all your help. 
Frasier: [troubled:] That's not necessary. 
    Roz: Oh, it is!  Look how close you helped me get, it's because 
         of you I'm second choice.
Frasier: I can't argue with that! [coming over:] There's something I 
         need to confess to you.  As much as I hoped that you would 
         get the job, there was a very small part of me - and a very 
         selfish part - that hoped you wouldn't.
    Roz: That's not bad.  That's really kinda sweet. 
Frasier: Oh, I'm glad you feel that way.  Because I happened to 
         mention those feelings to Bebe.
    Roz: [shocked:] Bebe?  You told Bebe?!
Frasier: Just in passing.
    Roz: Oh, great.  She torpedoed me, didn't she?
Frasier: Yes... well, she said I'd quit if you got the job.
    Roz: I can't believe this!
Frasier: Well, I'm glad to see that you're as mad at her as I am.
    Roz: I'm mad at you!
Frasier: Me?


    Roz: How could you have done that? 
Frasier: Well, it was just an offhand remark, how did I know how 
         she'd react?
    Roz: She's Bebe!  If you had said you liked my eyes, they would 
         have been on your desk tomorrow in a Tiffany box!
Frasier: Oh Roz, I'm so sorry.  Just tell me how I can make it up to 
         you.  I promise I will. 
    Roz: You mean it?
Frasier: Yes, anything, just name it!
    Roz: Fire Bebe.
Frasier: [surprised:] Well, em, how... isn't there something else 
         you'd like?
    Roz: The only thing I wanted was that job, and she took it away. 
         I'm not just suggesting this for my sake - I'm suggesting it 
         for yours.  She is your representative.  When she goes out 
         into the world lying and twisting your words and stabbing 
         people in the back, it reflects badly on you. 
Frasier: You're right, Roz.  How can I consider myself an ethical 
         person when I have the Princess of Darkness conducting my 
         business for me?  Well, that's it, I'm going to have to fire 
         that conniving harpy.
    Roz: I'm very proud of you. 
Frasier: I'm ashamed to think how long I've turned a blind eye on her 
         unscrupulous behaviour.  What for?  A 20% pay increase... 
         six-week paid vacation... an expense account... a travel 
         allowance...
    Roz: [worried:] Frasier?
Frasier: [mad:] Well, not anymore! 

He exits, followed by Roz.

FADE TO:

ACROSS THE RIVER STYX

Scene Two - Bebe's Office.
Frasier and Roz are in Bebe's waiting room.  Vera, an old secretary, 
talks into her phone summoning Bebe.

   Vera: Frasier Crane's here.  He's not alone. [to Frasier:] Have a 
         seat.
   Bebe: [enters waiting room:] Frasier, Roz, my two favourite 
         people. 
    Roz: Not for long.
Frasier: Bebe, we're going to discuss what happened this morning - 
         this time you won't wink your way out of it!
   Bebe: This is serious, you two come right in - we'll solve this 
         thing.  Let's just promise to be totally honest with each 
         other. 

Frasier and Roz enter the office as Bebe speaks to Vera aside.

   Bebe: We're losing one.  Code red!

Bebe enters the office and sits at her desk.  Signed photos of her 
clients decorate the room. A picture of Frasier and one of Bulldog 
are in prime place on the wall.

   Bebe: What can I get you?  Champagne?
    Roz: Nothing.
   Bebe: A massage?
Frasier: No, thank you.


   Bebe: You sure?  Vladimir can be here in five minutes, he will 
         play your spine like a Steinway.
    Roz: Can we just get started?
   Bebe: Roz, I'm just a wreck about our misunderstanding today.  
         Will you ever forgive me? 
    Roz: No. 
   Bebe: Why should you?  I don't forgive myself.
Frasier: Bebe, what you did today was unfair, and not just to Roz but 
         to me. 

As Frasier begins his speech Vera walks in with a tray.  She puts it 
down on the desk and begins taking pills and putting them in glasses. 
Then she pours a glass of water.  Bebe takes these simultaneously 
until it gets beyond a joke.

Frasier: [throughout the above:] Thanks to you, a strain has been put 
         on our relationship... both professional and... personally. 
         All of this I might be able to let go of as an isolated 
         incident, but... I am concerned that... [narked off about 
         the pill taking:] Are you quite alright?!
   Bebe: It's nothing, it's just a silly little cardiac thing. [to 
         Vera:] Go, go, you're distracting my client.  My clients 
         come first.

Vera begins to leave with the tray, however Roz picks the pill bottle 
up and shows it to Frasier as Vera exits.

    Roz: Oh, poor Bebe, how many fake pills do you have to take 
         everyday?
Frasier: Yes, do you really think that you can sit there popping a 
         bunch of... [sees label:] Digitalis!  Oh my God!  You really 
         are sick.

[N.B. Harriet Harris played a psychotic clone doctor in the X-Files
episode, "Eve," at the end of which her character is poisoned by a 
fatal dose of digitalis.]

   Bebe: Well, of course I'm sick.  But it makes me even sicker to 
         think that I've angered your will when all I wanted to do 
         was keep the best damn team in radio together!
    Roz: Oh God, we're gonna need a shovel to get out of here!
Frasier: Alright Bebe, be that as it may, but I still...

The phone interrupts Frasier.  Bebe answers it.

   Bebe: [angry into phone:] I told you, no calls! [listens] What 
         about my sister? [to Frasier and Roz:] One second. [into 
         phone:] Did the air bag deploy? [traumatised:] Look, I'm 
         gonna to have to call you back.  Frasier's here, and my 
         clients come first! [hangs up, then nearly crying:] Sorry, 
         you were saying?
Frasier: Since the moment we met you showed yourself to be ruthless 
         and untrustworthy.  As these are qualities I do not wish to 
         have associated with my name, I think it's best we simply 
         part...

Yet again the phone interrupts his speech.  Bebe again answers on 
speaker phone.

   Bebe: [answers:] What did I say about calls?!
   Girl: [young girl voice on phone crying:] Aunty Bebe.
   Bebe: [holding a girl's picture in her hand] Susy.  Sorry to hear 
         about your mummy's accident. 


   Girl: I'm frightened, Aunty Bebe. 
   Bebe: Don't be, little one.
   Girl: If mummy goes to heaven, will you take care of me?
   Bebe: Of course, my little lamb, assuming that I have the 
         resources.
Frasier: [intrigued:] Bebe, you know I can't help noticing that none 
         of your outside lines are lit up!
   Bebe: [crying:] The bulbs are broken! [to phone:] I'm going to 
         have to go.  I'm with a client and you know what we say 
         about clients.

Frasier opens the door at this point revealing Vera on the phone 
imitating the young girl.

   Vera: [in girl's voice:] They always come firth.
    Roz: You are amazing! 
Frasier: [to Bebe:] Is there nothing you won't stoop to? 
   Bebe: [feigning shock:] I had no idea who I was speaking to! [to 
         Vera:] How dare you impersonate my niece?!  I've had enough 
         of your cruel jokes - you're fired, mother! 

Vera just shrugs.

   Bebe: [to Frasier:] I just want to say...
Frasier: No, stop it!  Not one more crooked word!  Your tongue could 
         open a wine bottle.  From now, Frasier Crane has resigned 
         from your coven. 
   Bebe: [upset:] Huh! That's it, is it?  I'm not virtuous enough 
         for you, not noble.  Fine, quit!  Next time you need a deal 
         made, call the Dalai Lama.  A long time ago, I had to make a 
         choice between being a good agent and a good person, because 
         trust me, you can't be both!  So forgive me if I don't have 
         time to make everybody warm and fuzzy.  I am just too busy 
         spending every waking minute pouring any drink, pulling any 
         shameless tricks I can to make my clients' dreams come true! 
         I am a starmaker!  And if you can't appreciate that, there 
         are plenty that can! [to Roz:] How about you, you want an 
         agent.
Frasier: Oh pu-leeze!
    Roz: You mean it?
Frasier: Roz!
    Roz: I've never had an agent.  It's not like she worships the 
         Devil.
Frasier: Well, she doesn't have to!  He worships her!
    Roz: You're absolutely right, Frasier.  Forget it, Bebe.  No way! 
   Bebe: That voice - I could listen to it all day.  It's pure, yet 
         smouldering - like a nun with a past.
    Roz: You think so? 
Frasier: No, Roz, don't look her in the eye!
   Bebe: I could triple your salary - voice-overs, commercials...
Frasier: Roz, listen to me, for God's sake.  If you've got the 
         tiniest shred of sense or dignity left, remember what this 
         woman did to you this afternoon and renounce her.  She has 
         no scruples, no ethics, and no reflection! 
    Roz: Oh, let's get out of here. 
Frasier: [to Bebe:] Well, nice doing business with you. [pauses, then 
         obvious and nasty:] WINK!

Frasier and Roz walk out into the foyer.

     Roz: Oh!  Frasier, I forgot my purse. 
 Frasier: Alright.


Roz sticks her head back into the office.

    Roz: Lunchtime tomorrow?
   Bebe: 12:30, Benardi's.

Roz nods and leaves.

Fade Out.
