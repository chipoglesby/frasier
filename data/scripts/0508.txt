[Act One]

[Scene One - Café Nervosa.
Niles is in a cue at the counter. A man is in front ordering as three 
waiters work]

Customer: Half caff latte, please. 
Waiter 1: [shouts] Half caff latte!
Waitress: [shouts] Half caff latte!
Waiter 2: [shouts] Half caff latte!

[A coffee is made and handed to the customer]

   Niles: [now first in cue] I rather like this new system, it's 
          lively.
Waiter 1: Well, it's more efficient. What can I get for you?
   Niles: I'll have a double shot, low fat, no foam latte.
Waiter 1: [shouts] Double shot, low fat, no foam latte!
Waitress: [shouts] Double shot, non fat, low foam latte!
Waiter 2: [shouts] Double shot, non fat, no foam latte!
   Niles: Excuse me, I think there was a problem in the chain of 
          command, the middle person reversed part of it. She said, 
          "A double shot, non fat, low foam latte".
Waiter 1: [shouts] Double shot, non fat, low foam latte!
Waitress: [shouts] Double shot, non fat, low foam latte!
Waiter 2: [shouts] Double shot, non fat, no foam latte!
   Niles: No, it happened again, that's not what I want.
Waiter 2: Well, you can tell her youself.
   Niles: [to waitress] All right, I'll have a double shot, low fat, 
          no foam latte.
Waitress: [shouts] Double shot, low fat, no foam latte.
Waiter 2: [shouts] Double shot, low fat, no foam latte. Nutmeg?
Waitress: [shouts] Nutmeg?
Waiter 1: [shouts] Nutmeg?
   Niles: No thanks. It inflames my stomach lining.
Waiter 1: [shouts] Inflames his stomach lining!
Waitress: [shouts] Inflames his stomach lining!
Waiter 2: [shouts] Inflames his stomach lining!
   Niles: Stop that!
[Niles takes his coffee to his table as Frasier enters and sits with 
him. Frasier is weating a bulky red raincoat]


Frasier: Hello, Niles.
  Niles: Welcome back. I trust you and Samantha had a pleasant 
         weekend?
Frasier: Oh, God, it was fabulous. We stayed at this gorgeous cabin 
         just outside Aspen, we took a chopper every morning to the 
         top of the mountain, God, I just didn't want it to end.
  Niles: That would explain why you're still wearing that ridiculous 
         jacket in an over heated café.
Frasier: Oh, well, in Aspen they all wear them indoors. Oh, God, the 
         funniest thing happened in the lodge last night. Jack 
         Nicholson and Tom Brokaw discovered they were wearing 
         exactly the same jacket. [laughs] So they staged a mock 
         fight. Suddenly, Donna Karen flew between them pretending to 
         referee, I laughed so hard I nearly spilled my toddy on 
         someone named Puff Daddy.

[The waitress comes over]

Waitress: Can I get anything for you?
   Niles: Just a dustpan and broom to sweep up some of these names!
 Frasier: Cappucino, please.

[Waitress goes back]

Frasier: Oh, by the way, Niles. Do we have plans for tonight? 
  Niles: Yes, why?
Frasier: Well, I'm afraid I have to cancel. It's my one month 
         anniversary with Sam, I'd like to take her to L'escalias for 
         dinner.
  Niles: I understand, of course. One month is quite a milestone, 
         thanks for the reminder - I need to change my water filter. 
         [sips coffee] Damn, they put nutmeg on this!
Frasier: Oh, speaking of Meg. Meg Ryan told me the most delightful 
         story about practical joke Tony Hopkins played on Jodie at 
         the ramp party for the "Lambs".
  Niles: My stomach lining is just not going to get a break today, is 
         it?!

IT'S NOT YOU, IT'S ME...

NO, IT'S YOU

[Scene Two - Restaurant.
Frasier is sat at the table as Sam arrives]

    Sam: Look, I'm sorry I was late, Frasier.
Frasier: Oh, gosh, no, no, that's all right. I took the liberty of 
         ordering us the "Taste Of Monaco" dinner.
    Sam: Oh, good choice.
Frasier: As I recall, that's what you ordered on our first date. 
         Course, it wasn't food that you were craving that night. You 
         whisked me away back to my place before the crab cakes could 
         even arrive. You know, there's no better way to celebrate an 
         anniversary than with a historical re-enactment. I've got my 
         costume on underneath!
    Sam: Actually, I'm really looking forward to those crab cakes.
Frasier: Oh, great, well, yes, yes, I suppose we should try the food 
         here once. [laughs] Well, be sure to leave some room, you're 
         bound to find a little Frasier-mint on your pillow when we 
         get home! [laughs] By the way, thanks again for this 
         weekend.
    Sam: You're welcome.
Frasier: You know, it's funny, I think it was a real turning point 
         for us... well, for me.  You see, I was so relaxed!  At the 


         beginning of relationships usually I-I'm very tentative. I 
         just have this dark fear that I'm about to be cut loose. 
         [laughs]
    Sam: Frasier...
Frasier: Oh, I know, I know. I'm just being so insecure, it's nice to 
         know that I'm on solid ground.
    Sam: Um, Frasier...
Frasier: I'm standing on quicksand, aren't I?
    Sam: I didn't want to talk about this until later...
Frasier: Oh my God!
    Sam: I was just... It's not working out between the two of us. 
         Now, it's not you, it's me. I just don't feel the same way 
         about us anymore.
Frasier: But things were going so well. What happened?
    Sam: Oh, nothing happened. We had a wonderful time together, 
         Frasier, it's just run its course. I'm sorry.
Frasier: Oh, well, I'm sorry too.
    Sam: I hope we can still be friends.
Frasier: Oh, yes, I'd like that too. Well, you know, seeing as we're 
         friends and all, I suppose there's no reason we shouldn't 
         stay and enjoy what's sure to be a splendid meal.
    Sam: Absolutely.
Frasier: Great.

[There is a eerie silence until the waiter arrives]

 Waiter: Your first course. [puts them down]
Frasier: Ah, thank you. Tell me, how many more courses are there?
 Waiter: Six, sir.
Frasier: Could you bring those all at once?

[Scene Three - Frasier's Apartment.
Daphne and Martin are eating breakfast. Daphne is reading the 
newspaper]

Daphne: Good Lord!
Martin: What?
Daphne: Look at this headline.

[Daphne passes over the paper]

Martin: [reads] "Martin Crane Dead". Wu-hu-oo! Bet you don't need 
        much coffee after that! Gee, fifty eight, poor guy, hardly 
        had a life.
Daphne: Handsome fellow, though.
Martin: Yeah, multi-millionaire, decorated war hero, wrote a spy 
        novel. [reads] "Survived by his wife, Florence, former Miss. 
        Washington and two sons, Joe, a Marine Corps colonel, and the 
        professional baseball player, Mickey Crane". [puts paper 
        down] Nothing like starting the day off jealous of a dead 
        guy!

[Frasier enters, wearing his lazy clothes, carrying a box]

Frasier: Oh, hello all. [they greet him]
 Daphne: You were up and out early today.
Frasier: Yes, well, I thought like taking a walk. I've got a lot on 
         my mind, I picked up some pastry. [puts it down and sits]
 Daphne: Well, whatever it is, you'll cheer up when you see these 
         photos from your ski weekend. I admit, I took a peek. [hands 
         them over] I must say, this Sam of yours is quite a catch. 
         She's gorgeous, smart, stylish...
Frasier: We broke up last night! [discards photos]


 Daphne: Orange juice, anyone?

[Daphne exits to the kitchen]

 Martin: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, Fras'.
Frasier: Oh, it's all right. It was a mutual decision. Well, a little 
         more mutual on her part than mine. Once she dumped me, I 
         jumped right on board. Anyway, I'll be fine, dad.
 Martin: Well, that's the spirit, just put it all behind you.

[Daphne enters]

Frasier: Exactly. But I must admit, I'm having a little difficulty 
         achieving closure. See, Sam said that her feelings changed 
         for no reason! Can't help it might have been something 
         specific about me!
 Martin: Now, hold on, don't try to make this your fault!
 Daphne: Yeah, she's probably telling the truth. If a woman's trying 
         to spare your feelings, she'll give you the old, "It's not 
         you, it's me".
Frasier: That's exactly what she said!
 Daphne: Waffles, anyone?

[Daphne exits to kitchen]

 Martin: Now, you know, Fras', I know you're always looking for an 
         explanation for everything but sometimes there isn't one.
Frasier: Yeah, I know dad. It's gonna just drive me crazy. You know, 
         until I know why it ended, I'll just assume it was any 
         number of things about me. My self confidence will be 
         shattered.
 Martin: Well, you've got two choices here. You can spend days trying 
         to figure it out until it drives you nuts or you can do the 
         smart thing, make a clean break, never talk to her again, 
         and get on with your life.

[There's a pause whilst Frasier considers this]

Frasier: You're right, dad, that's exactly what I should do. Thank 
         you.
 Martin: No problem.
Frasier: You know, sometimes you're very insightful.
 Martin: Well, I've been around the block a few times. [pause] So, 
         when are you going to go talk to her?
Frasier: Right after my waffles.

[Martin nods after knowing his son for so long as Frasier reads the 
paper]

[Scene Four - Outside The King's Crown Court.
Frasier is sat on the steps reading his paper as Sam comes out of the 
building]

Frasier: Sam, Sam, what are the chances?! You've found my thinking 
         place!
    Sam: Frasier, listen, I'm ten minutes late for a deposition.
Frasier: Well, we can walk and talk.
    Sam: All right.

[They start walking]

Frasier: Look, you know, I'm loving this new arrangement of ours, I 
         think we being friends thing is going to work out great.


    Sam: Uh, listen, could you pick up the pace a little?

[Sam starts walking faster, Frasier can barely keep up]

Frasier: Right. So, how've you been?
    Sam: Frasier, I just saw you last night.
Frasier: So you did, and now that you bring up last night... God, you 
         do walk fast... Er, I'm looking for a little clarification.
    Sam: I told you this has nothing to do with you.
Frasier: Yes, but it seems highly unlikely that such a sudden change 
         could have nothing to do with me. I mean, maybe it is 
         something that I did unintentionally. [bumps into someone] 
         I'm sorry, my fault. [moves on] You know, something this 
         weekend, maybe? I know I played the piano in the lounge a 
         little too long but who knew General Schwartzkopf was so 
         crazy for show tunes!
    Sam: Frasier, there's nothing I'm not telling you. Sometimes 
         things just end. Please, try to not take it so personally.
Frasier: All right.
    Sam: Right, I really am late, I'll talk to you soon, okay?
Frasier: Take care.

[Sam leaves as Frasier looks after her. He turns around and bumps 
into a man carrying some groceries]

Frasier: Oh...
    Man: What's the matter with you?
Frasier: That's just it. I don't know!

[End of Act One]

[Act Two]

[Scene One - Frasier's Apartment.
Martin is searching the living room as Niles and Daphne are chatting]

 Niles: Where is Frasier? He knows we have "Berveda's", if you're 
        late they give away your table and make you sit in the 
        kitchen with the owner's mother.
Martin: What the hell did I do with that remote? Daphne, are you sure 
        you haven't seen it?
Daphne: Positive.
Martin: They ought to make one with a sensor on it. You get more than 
        twenty feet from the TV, it senses it and starts beeping. 
        Maybe for a deaf person they could make one that has purple 
        smoke coming out of it like some kind of flare system or 
        something.

[Daphne suddenly holds Martin's face and stares him in the eyes]

Daphne: Mr. Crane, I'm begging you, you've got to get out of the 
        house more!

[Frasier then enters]

Frasier: Hello all. Oh, Niles, what a pleasant surprise.
  Niles: Just what Momma Bervada will say when we pull up a chair!
Frasier: Oh, that's right, dinner, I completely forgot. I took a long 
         walk after work, I'm sorry, Niles. It must have completely 
         slipped my mind.
  Niles: Yes, well, "Bervada's" out now. I take it you're still 
         consumed with the Sam situation.
Frasier: I was just trying to figure out what happened.


  Niles: The relationship ended, that's what happened.
Frasier: But there's got to be a reason!

[Martin then enters with a broom and sits down. He starts to trying 
to change the channel with it]

  Niles: See, you're fixated.
Frasier: I am not fixated! [pointing at Martin] That is fixated! Dad, 
         what the hell are you doing?
 Martin: Oh, this is stupid! Maybe if I stick together ten chopsticks 
         and put a rubber tip on the end for gripping.

[Martin exits to the kitchen as the doorbell sounds. Frasier answers 
it to Roz]

Frasier: Oh, hello.
    Roz: Hi.
 Daphne: I'll be ready in a sec, Roz.

[Daphne leaves to her bedroom]

    Roz: [calls] Oh, it's all right, the movie doesn't start till 
         eight.
Frasier: Oh, yes, that's right, I forgot you two had plans. Come on 
         in, Roz. You know, I was wondering...
    Roz: No! I don't know why Sam broke up with you, okay? Just like 
         I didn't know two hours ago. Just like Gil and Bulldog and 
         Miss. Judy from the Arts & Crafts hour didn't know!
Frasier: It never hurts to ask. Miss. Judy had some real insights 
         before she had to make her popsicle stick run.

[Martin enters from the kitchen as Daphne enters from her room]

 Martin: I think I'll go to Duke's, watch the game there.
Frasier: Oh, wait, wait, everybody, before you scatter. I'd like to 
         ask an enormous favour. In the spirit of, well, self-
         improvement. I'd like you to tell me in your own words just 
         what exactly about me you find unloveable.

[The rest refuse and begin to leave]

Frasier: Wait! Wait, my God, it's really for the sake of our future 
         relationships. I mean, it just, I know that you're afraid to 
         hurt my feelings but I can stand a little constructive 
         criticism. Now, come on, please, what do you think are my 
         main faults?
 Martin: Well, let's start with what you're doing now. You analyse 
         everything to death. Sam said it wasn't your fault but you 
         keep digging around and digging around until you drive 
         everybody nuts.
Frasier: [writing in pad] Okay. Dad thinks I am over analytical. 
         That's great, we've got the ball rolling, okay, who's next? 
         Niles?
  Niles: I'm sorry, I'm not entirely sure how useful this exercise 
         is.
Frasier: Niles, I don't care how you feel about it, you're going to 
         participate!
  Niles: Pushy.
Frasier: Well, yes, if that's what it takes to... [realises] Oh, 
         thank you. [writes it] All right, Daphne, it's your turn, 
         don't be shy.
 Daphne: Well, if I had to choose, I'd say you are a bit of a fuss 
         budget.
Frasier: Fuss budget! Well, listen, if you don't mind the 


         substitution, I think maybe "demanding" is more the mot 
         juste.
 Daphne: Pretentious.
Frasier: Right, you see, this is very good. Roz, you must have 
         something?
    Roz: Well, you are a little full of yourself.
Frasier: Great. Okay, pompous.
    Roz: And you do tend to ramble on with the callers.
Frasier: [writing] A tad loquacious.
 Martin: Pretentious.
Frasier: Dad, I all ready wrote that down.
 Martin: Underline it!

[Frasier writes it in]

 Niles: Oh, snippy.
Daphne: Sarcastic.
Martin: Bossy.
 Niles: Huffy.
   Roz: Vain.

[They all start talking to each other about how each one's true until 
Frasier stops them]

Frasier: Oh, how nice we've finally found an activity we all enjoy 
         together!
    Roz: Oh, come on, Frasier, why don't you just admit what you're 
         doing here. This isn't some "help-me-be-a-better-person"
         thing. You're trying to figure out what you can fix so you 
         can win Sam back.
Frasier: Oh, now, Roz, that's proposterous.
    Roz: Look who you're talking to! I've been down this road so many 
         times, I call it "The Roz Expressway".
  Niles: I've heard that phrase before but in a slightly different 
         context.

[Roz gives a sharp look as Niles goes off to pour a sherry]

Frasier: Well, all right, maybe there is some truth in what you say, 
         I mean, after all, Sam is really quite a catch, why wouldn't 
         I want to get her back?
    Roz: But you shouldn't change yourself just to please her. It's 
         not healthy, and it doesn't work, and if it did, Steve 
         Wilson would be my husband and not just some name tattoed on 
         my butt!
 Daphne: If you want my advice; the best thing you can do is nothing. 
         Just leave her be to think about what she's missing out on.
    Roz: I totally agree. No candy, no flowers and what ever you do, 
         don't call.
Frasier: Well, I don't see anything wrong with keeping the lines of 
         communication open.
    Roz: Oh God, you called didn't you?
Frasier: Well, maybe I left a carefully worded message.
    Roz: Oh, Frasier, you never call somebody who's broken up with 
         you. It makes you look desperate.
Frasier: Well, I didn't have any choice, she wouldn't return any of 
         my pagers! [realises] Oh God, I've blown it haven't I?
 Daphne: Well, that depends. What did you say in your message?
Frasier: Well, nothing undignified. Of course, tone of voice is 
         everything, isn't it? You know, maybe I should just play 
         them for you.
    Roz: Wait, you have her access code for her answering machine?
Frasier: Yes, luckily I set it up with her. I gave her an access code 


         that would be easy to remember - my birthday.
 Martin: What's so easy about May 7th?
Frasier: I wouldn't know, dad, my birthday's in March!
 Martin: Oh, that's right. The seventh, that's Eddie!

[Frasier keys in the machine]

Frasier: Okay, okay, here we go. All right, now, listen and tell me 
         if you think I sound desperate.

[The machine beeps]

Secretary: [v.o] Hi, Sam. Two quick things - dinner at L'escalias is 
           not at 8:30 and the judge needs to see you at nine 
           tomorrow morning and not ten. Bye.
    Niles: I didn't get desperate, I got feminine!
  Frasier: Shut up, Niles!

[The machine beeps]

Frasier: [v.o] Hello, Sam, it's Frasier. Give me a call, if you get a 
         chance. Bye.
 Daphne: You don't sound desperate at all.

[The machine beeps]

Frasier: [v.o] Hi, Sam, I forgot to mention I'll be at the office. 
         Call me. It's Frasier.
  Niles: Well, maybe just a whiff of desperation.

[The machine beeps]

Frasier: [v.o] Hi, I'm at the office now.

[The machine beeps]

Frasier: [v.o] Still at the office.

[The machine beeps]

Frasier: [v.o] I stepped out to the coffee machine. Thought I might 
         have missed you.
  Niles: How quickly a whiff becomes a stench!

[The machine beeps]

[Frasier's voice comes through the machine as he switches it off]

Frasier: You know, they just get worse after that.
 Martin: There's more?
Frasier: Yes. [presses button] Not anymore though. There, messages 
         erased.
    Roz: Hey, your messages were not the only ones on there. What 
         about the one from her secretary about the meeting with the 
         judge?
Frasier: Oh, my God, you're right. That did sound important.
    Roz: So, what are you going to do about it?
Frasier: Well, I guess I could just call back and leave a message 
         saying that I inadvertantly erased the message of hers while 
         I was erasing a bunch of other messages that I left earlier.
    Roz: With her secret access code!
Frasier: [realising] Right! Oh, God, this is humiliating.
 Martin: Now, Frasier, I hate to appear unsupportive, but I've got to 


         get to Duke's for the game.
    Roz: Yeah, and we're going to be late for that movie.
 Daphne: Oh, wait, I forgot my purse. 

[Daphne goes to get purse from kitchen]

Martin: Oh, don't worry about it Frasier. You'll be fine, you'll 
        bounce back. You're tough.
   Roz: And resourceful.
 Niles: Resilient.
Martin: Optimistic.
 Niles: Tenacious.
Daphne: Conceited.
Martin: Different list, Daph'!

[Daphne, Martin and Roz leave the apartment as Frasier sits at the 
table with Niles. He looks at the photos]

Frasier: It's hard to believe this picture was taken only three days 
         ago. Look at us. How happy I was. Now, I'll never see her 
         again.
  Niles: Aren't you over dramatising? You're bound to run into her 
         now and then.
Frasier: No, I was talking about me and Lesley Stahl.
  Niles: You know, looking at these photos, I can't help noticing 
         there are very few of you and Sam together.
Frasier: What are you getting at?
  Niles: Well, I'm just wondering how much you really feel for this 
         woman?
Frasier: Oh, don't be ridiculous, I haven't felt this way for ages.
  Niles: I'm sorry. I guess I was wrong. It's love then.

[Niles pours a sherry]

Frasier: Well, I don't know about love. We've only been seeing each 
         other for a month.
  Niles: But you could see yourself falling in love with her?
Frasier: Possibly.
  Niles: Some time down the line?
Frasier: Yes, yes, perhaps.
  Niles: Well, no wonder you're heartbroken. You've just lost the 
         only woman you could even possibly sometime down the line 
         perhaps fall in love with. I'm surprised the country music 
         people haven't jumped all over this one!
Frasier: Oh, all right, so I don't rhapsodise about her.
  Niles: No, you did rhapsodise when she took you to "Le Cigare 
         Volant" and you were seated in a secret VIP room we never 
         knew existed.
Frasier: What are you suggesting? That I'm so shallow I was with her 
         mainly for her connections?
  Niles: I wouldn't put it as harshly as that but let's face it, ever 
         since we were young, you've had a yearning to run with the 
         cool kids and it's never worked out for you. Your one day on 
         the football team? The summer you bought that motorcycle. 
         Although, to be accurate...
Frasier: Hey, it's only a moped if you pedal it and I never pedaled!
  Niles: I just wonder if what you're mourning is not so much the 
         loss of Sam, it's the loss of her celebrity lifestyle.
Frasier: I must admit things never did seem quite right between us. 
         God, if it hadn't been for her friends, I probably would 
         have broken it off myself. Oh, God, shame on me.
  Niles: Don't punish yourself, Frasier. At least you're deep enough 
         to realise you're shallow. [pause] Dinner?


Frasier: Let's.
  Niles: All right.
Frasier: All though, I've still got to phone her about that message.
  Niles: Oh, you know what. Why don't we stop by "L'escalias" on our 
         way to dinner. You can just run in and tell her in person.
Frasier: Even better! God, Niles, I can't tell you helpful this has 
         been. Really, how can I ever repay you?
  Niles: You can start by getting me into that VIP room in "Le Cigare 
         Volant" - where is the entrance? [guesses] By the cigarette 
         machine?
Frasier: No, that's just a decoy. It's through the dry cleaner's next 
         door.
  Niles: No.

[Niles and Frasier exit]

IF IT'S BARBRA,
I'LL KILL MYESLF

[Scene Two - Restaurant.
Sam is sat at a table as Frasier enters to greet her]

Frasier: Hello, Sam.
    Sam: Frasier.
Frasier: I know you didn't expect to see me tonight.
    Sam: Well, of course after all the messages, I'm not totally 
         surprised.
Frasier: Oh God, you heard them?
    Sam: I checked my machine this afternoon. Frasier, I think we 
         really need to talk.
Frasier: No, no, we don't. I promise you I will never call you again. 
         I've thought about this and believe me you made the right 
         decision.
    Sam: No, no, I didn't.
Frasier: Excuse me?
    Sam: Yes. Please, sit down. [he does] I was going to call you 
         later anyway. You see, I think I figured out what happened 
         between the two of us. I panicked. You see, I was starting 
         to really care about you. I thought we might even have a 
         future, even, and, well, it scared well. But the way you 
         pursued me, showing up at the courthouse and leaving all of 
         those messages and now you're here. Obviously, you feel just 
         as strongly as I do. It's funny really. The both of us 
         falling in love so fast and not realising the other one felt 
         the same way. We should be laughing.

[Frasier fakes a laugh and then tires]

Frasier: Oh, listen, Sam...
    Sam: No, no, I'm going to tell you what we're going to be doing 
         this weekend. We're taking the concord to London for a party 
         at Alec Guiness' place.
Frasier: I'm not so sure that... [realises] Sir Alec Guiness?
    Sam: Yes, well, I know it's a long way to go but Stephen is going 
         to be there, he's promised to play some songs for the new 
         one.
Frasier: I don't know... [realises] Stephen Sondheim?
    Sam: Yes, oh, and you'll never guess who'll be singing with him.
Frasier: [cringes] No, please don't tell me, please.
    Sam: Frasier, what is it? You seem upset.
Frasier: Sam, I can't see you anymore.
    Sam: What?


Frasier: I think you're an incredible woman but I've come to a 
         realisation about us, well about me, and I just don't see 
         any future for us. I know it sounds strange after the way I 
         was pursuing you but I... I've been in it for all the wrong 
         reasons.
    Sam: Like what?
Frasier: Well, I'm not very proud of this, but maybe I was a little 
         dazzled by the circle you travel in.
    Sam: So you were with me just so you could be around some famous 
         people?
Frasier: It's not as though I wasn't fond of you as well.
    Sam: Fond of me? Oh, well, thank you very much.
Frasier: But I understand that you're upset and I'm just gonna go.
    Sam: I don't believe this... my friend!
Frasier: I know it's shallow and it's something I'm going to have to 
         work on.

[Lesley Stahl walks up behind them and greets Sam]

 Lesley: Hi, Sam, how are you?
Frasier: [star struck] Lesley, hello. Dr. Frasier Crane, we met this 
         weekend. 
 Lesley: Oh, are how you?
    Sam: What kind of sick bastard are you?
Frasier: Don't worry, we're just having a little bit of a spat. But, 
         of course, I don't need to tell you, being the ace reporter 
         that you are.
    Sam: Just get out of here right now!
Frasier: Right, right, okay. [then to Leslie] Listen, if you're in
         town for a while, maybe we can have lunch?
    Sam: Get out!
Frasier: What is the matter with me?!

[Frasier goes up onto the balcony and looks back]

Frasier: Lesley. [gestures towards her that he'll ring her]

[Sam throws a bread roll at him and he runs out, scared by himself]

[End of Act Two]

Credits:

[Martin is sat watching the television in Frasier's apartment and 
decides he needs to change the channel. He picks up his invention 
from the side of his chair: lots of chopsticks tied together with a 
rubber tubing for gripping. This seems to be successful. Meanwhile, 
Daphne watches him and rolls her eyes. She puts away some magazines 
on to the shelf and finds the remote control. She decides to have a 
bit of fun and changes the channel back on the television. Martin, 
not realising Daphne found the remote, thinks there's something wrong 
with the television and changes it back. This carries on for a while 
until Martin just starts hitting the television with his invention]
