[Act 1]

[Scene 1 – Café Nervosa.
Frasier, Niles and Martin are all sitting at a table outside the 
Café.  Niles is busy examining his coffee intently.]

  Niles: Is it me or is the foam a tad dense today?
Frasier: Like a dreary fog on a Scottish moor.
  Niles: Rather than accent it overwhelms.  Rather than flirt it 
         assaults.
 Martin: [annoyed] Rather than watching the ballgame I have to listen 
         to this.

[Roz comes over to join them.]

Roz: Hey, you guys.
All: Hey, Roz.
Roz: Frasier, don’t forget your staff meeting tomorrow.  It starts at...

[A man comes and sits down at the nearby table.  Roz just stops 
talking and can’t take her eyes off him.]

Frasier: Well, I certainly hope his tailor can fix the two holes 
         you’ve just burned in his jacket!
    Roz: They’re not in his jacket!  It starts tomorrow at ten.  Hey, 
         Marty.  What are you doing here? 
 Martin: They’re dragging me out to buy some new clothes.
  Niles: We’re taking him out to Rodolfo’s once-a-year sale.  It’s 
         fifty per cent off.  Alterations are free.
 Martin: Big deal.  "Bud’s Clothing" do that every day.
Frasier: Yes, not to mention the convenience of getting your 
         "BigFoot" pizza right next door.
 Martin: These guys think I have bad taste in clothes.
    Roz: Well, I like the way you dress.
  Niles: I believe that’s what’s called "the clincher."  Shall we go?
 Martin: [getting up] All right.  Well I’ll just hit the head and we 
         can get it over with.
  Niles: Dad, you could show a little more enthusiasm.
 Martin: OK. [fake enthusiasm as he goes inside the Café] Gee, I 
         can’t wait to hit the head and we can get it all over with.


[Roz is still busy staring at the guy across the table which Niles 
notices.]

  Niles: Are you quite finished undressing him with your eyes?
    Roz: Oh, please.  I’m already looking for my stockings and trying 
         to remember where I parked my car.
Frasier: [gesturing at another guy] You know Roz, I would have 
         thought that the gentleman over there with the flannel shirt 
         would have been more your type.
    Roz: Him?  Not a chance.  See the way he’s slurping his orange 
         juice?  Sloppy kisser!  You can tell right away the guy’s no 
         good I bed.  So cautious.  Look at the way he’s blowing on 
         his coffee.

[Meanwhile Niles is, needless to say, blowing on his coffee and 
notices Frasier and Roz staring at him.]

  Niles: I wasn’t trying to cool it.  I was simply blowing a foam 
         hole.
    Roz: You don’t even wrinkle the sheets, do you?
Frasier: [looking across the street] Niles, that man across the 
         street at the newsstand.  Is that who I think it is?
  Niles: He does look familiar.
Frasier: It’s T.H. Houghton!
  Niles: No!
Frasier: Just think back to the picture on the dust cover of "Time 
         Flies Tomorrow."  A little older, greyer.
    Roz: "Time Flies Tomorrow" – I read that in high school.  What  
         else did he write?
Frasier: Nothing.  That’s the crux of his entire legend.  The man 
         published one masterpiece and in the thirty years since he’s 
         become a virtual recluse.
  Niles: Oh my God.  It is T.H. Houghton.  We’re a stone’s throw away
         from one of the giants of American literature.
    Roz: Not the way you throw!
Frasier: Niles, this is incredible.  The man’s entire life is shrouded 
         in mystery and there he is.
  Niles: I’ve always idolised him.  What I wouldn’t give to meet that 
         man. 
    Roz: Well why don’t you go over and introduce yourself?
  Niles: I can’t just walk up to a God like that.
    Roz: Well find a subtler way.
  Niles: In your vernacular that would be what?  To slingshot your 
         panties across the street?
    Roz: Foam Blower!
Frasier: [separating the two] Niles, she happens to be right.  How 
         often do we get an opportunity like this?  Come on.  Let’s go.
  Niles: All right.

[Martin comes back out of the Café.]

Frasier: Dad, come on.  We’re going.
 Martin: Why, what’s the rush?
  Niles: T.H. Houghton is across the street.
 Martin: Who?
Frasier: [pushing Martin as fast as he can] Come on.  Let’s go.
 Martin: Hey!  Guy with a cane here!

IN ANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST...

[Scene 2 – A Nearby Bar.
Niles, Frasier and Martin pile into a bar.  Niles and Frasier are 


arguing.]

Frasier: Niles, I thought you said you saw Houghton come in here.
  Niles: Well, I’m sorry if my tracking skills aren’t up to your 
         standard.  Perhaps instead of asking for a baby brother you 
         should have asked for a German shorthaired Pointer.
Frasier: I did!  Well, I’m sorry.
  Niles: He must still be out on the street.  Let’s go.
 Martin: I’m parking it here.  They’ve got the Mariners game on.
Frasier: Dad, Dad.  Please.  We can’t waste time.
  Niles: Oh let him be.  He’s dead weight.
Frasier: Right.

[Frasier and Niles charge back out in search for Houghton.  Meanwhile 
an old man comes from the other side of the bar and sits down next to 
Martin.  It is obvious that this is going to be T.H. Houghton.]

Houghton: What’s the score?
  Martin: Four to three, Mariners.
    Both: [watching the game] Awww! 
  Martin: I mean, that’s the cut-off man!
Houghton: Can you believe that man makes seven million a year?
  Martin: That’s crazy.  See him scratching his butt?  That’s about 
          five grand a year right there!
Houghton: [laughing to the barman] Let me have a Ballantine.
  Martin: Yeah, make it two.

[They both continue to watch the game together.  The scene SWITCHES to 
later on and Houghton and Martin are sitting at a table after the 
game talking.]

Houghton: So that’s your favourite character, really?
  Martin: Yeah, I really like him.  He’s the kind of guy you can just 
          sit and have a beer with.
Houghton: Well, I can see you saying that about "Hoss."  But Little 
          Joe?
  Martin: Well that’s the great thing about "Bonanza."  There’s 
          something for everyone.

[Frasier and Niles come into the bar with Frasier looking 
exasperated.]

Frasier: Well thank you, Mr. False Alarm. [imitating Niles] Oh, look. 
         There he is over at the yoghurt store.  Oh look.  There he is 
         at the futon store.  Oh look.  There he is with Dad.

[Frasier and Niles suddenly see that he is with Martin and look 
completely taken aback.  Meanwhile over at the table Houghton is 
getting up to go.]

  Niles: And now he’s leaving.  I must tell him what an impact his 
         book has made on my life.
Frasier: Aren’t you afraid it will sound just a bit unoriginal?
  Niles: Why?
Frasier: Because I’m going to say it first.

[Niles and Frasier rush over to T.H. Houghton.  Before they can get 
there another patron from the bar gets in before them.]

  Patron: Excuse me, Mr. Houghton?
Houghton: Yeah.
  Patron: I just wanted to tell you that...
Houghton: My book changed your life.  Swell.


  Patron: No, no.
Houghton: It changed mine too.  Look, I’m sorry, I don’t like to 
          discuss my work. 

[He leaves.]

 Patron: Well, that was humiliating.  I’ve never felt so rejected in 
         my life.
Frasier: Now, now.  Don’t take it so hard.  Who was to know you’d be 
         so sensitive?
 Patron: Hey, aren’t you Dr. Frasier Crane?
Frasier: [walking away from him] Not now, I don’t have the time.  I’m 
         sorry. [joins Martin at the table] Dad, do you realise who 
         you were just talking to?  That was T.H. Houghton.
 Martin: Yeah, I know.
  Niles: Well, what did you two talk about?
 Martin: Oh, I don’t know.  This and that.
Frasier: Dad, virtually nothing is known about this man.  Can’t you 
         give us something specific?
 Martin: It was just guy stuff, you know?  Baseball, TV shows, old war 
         stories.
Frasier: He told war stories?
 Martin: No, I did.  I told him about the time I made the stew and the 
         platoon got sick.
Frasier: How could you?
 Martin: He liked it.  He’s a nice guy.  I think maybe I’ll buy one 
         of his books.
Frasier: Not books, Dad.  Book.  Book.  He wrote one book and then 
         never wrote again.
  Niles: Well, if only we’d arrived ten minutes earlier.  We could 
         have been talking to him.  Could have that explored that 
         mammoth intellect.
Frasier: Can you imagine the torture the man’s endured to peak at 
         such an early age?
  Niles: [notices a beermat on the table] Oh my God, Frasier.  Look. 
         It’s a doodle.
Frasier: Not just any doodle.  It’s a Houghton doodle.  It’s mine.
  Niles: It’s mine. [fights over it with Frasier]
 Martin: It’s mine.
Frasier: Dad, what do you care? 
 Martin: I mean I drew it.
Frasier: [handing it to Niles] Well that’s very touching.  Here Niles, 
         this is for you.

[Scene 3 – The Elevator.
Frasier and Niles are going up to Frasier’s apartment in the 
elevator.]

  Niles: I don’t know when I’ve enjoyed an exhibit more.  The artist’s 
         choice to make that still-life a monochrome was a stroke of 
         genius.  Conveyed such despair.
Frasier: [deep in thought] Yes.  It was so refreshing to see a sad 
         peach.
  Niles: How about that curator?
Frasier: Kind of a peach herself, wasn’t she?
  Niles: No cubism there, I don’t think.

[The elevator doors open outside Frasier’s apartment.  Martin and 
T.H. Houghton are waiting to go down.  Niles and Frasier only notice 
Martin at first.]

  Martin: Hey, boys.
    Both: Hi, Dad. [both notice that T.H. Houghton is getting on the 


          elevator with Martin and are momentarily lost for words.]
  Martin: Oh Ted, I’d like you to meet my sons.  This is Frasier and 
          Niles.  They’re big fans of yours.
Houghton: Hi, guys.
 Frasier: Mr Houghton... er... we...
   Niles: Words can’t express... [totally flabbergasted]
Houghton: I guess not.  Nice meeting you folks. [the elevator door 
          closes]
   Niles: We missed them again. [presses the lift button and the doors 
          open]
  Martin: What’s going on?
   Niles: That’s odd.  So where are you two going?
  Martin: Well, Ted’s taking me out to this Bratwurst place he knows.
 Frasier: Bratwurst.  Yummee.  My God, that’s our favourite.
Houghton: Nice meeting you.

[The elevator door closes once more.  Niles, not content, hits the 
elevator button again and the door opens again.  Houghton looks 
puzzled while Martin just looks annoyed.]

Houghton: What’s wrong with this thing?
   Niles: Could be broken.  Well maybe if you came into the apartment 
          we could call down to the front desk...
  Martin: NO! [pushing Niles away with his cane] I’m sure it’ll work 
          this time!

[The elevator door closes for the last time.  Niles looks despondent 
and follows Frasier into his apartment.  Daphne is busy cleaning.]

Frasier: What the hell was he doing here?
  Niles: We might know if you hadn’t spent an hour pondering the 
         despair of the peach.
Frasier: This from the man who spent thirty minutes looking at "Woman 
         with a rectangular head."
 Daphne: Oh, was Mrs. Foster in the lobby again?
Frasier: No, Daphne.  Could you explain to me just how T.H. Houghton 
         ended up in my apartment?
 Daphne: Well, he’s only in town for a couple of days.  He doesn’t 
         know too many people so he looked your father up, gave him a 
         ring and Mr. Crane invited him over to watch the Mariners 
         game.
Frasier: [gobsmacked] He was here all afternoon?
 Daphne: Yes.  It’s a shame you couldn’t be here.  He told the most 
         fascinating stories.  Of course he and your father are 
         getting on like old chums, but the sweetest thing was how he 
         took to Eddie.
Frasier: [clearly at his wits' end] He spent time with Eddie?
 Daphne: Fed him his afternoon biscuit.
Frasier: Will the madness ever end?

[Frasier walks off to the kitchen.  Niles rushes after him.]

  Niles: Now, now, let’s not give up hope.  Maybe Dad will bring him 
         back to the apartment after dinner.
Frasier: Oh, well I doubt it.  He’ll probably run into J.D. Salinger 
         and Salman Rushdie – go out for Margaritas.  You know, Niles, 
         these near misses are just excruciating. 
 Daphne: [unseen in the living room] There you go, Mr. Houghton. 
         You’re welcome.

[Frasier and Niles look up before tearing through to the living room. 
Daphne has just said goodbye.]


Frasier: Was that him?
 Daphne: Yes.  He forgot his coat.
Frasier: [charging out the front door with Niles in hot pursuit] Hold 
         the elevator!

[The elevator door has just closed.  Niles and Frasier collapse 
against it in despair.]

Niles: We missed him again.

[Eddie runs out to the hall and sits down in front of Niles and 
Frasier.]

Frasier: Don’t you dare gloat, you miserable little biscuit whore!

[End of Act 1]

[Act 2]

QUESTION: HOW DID BABE RUTH CHANGE MUSICAL THEATER HISTORY?

[Scene 1 - Frasier’s Apartment.
Daphne is lying back on the couch reading, eating peanuts and having 
a drink.  Eddie is keeping watch at the front door and suddenly barks. 
Daphne quickly gets up, pours what’s left of her peanuts into her 
pocket, downs her drink, puts the glass in the other pocket, pulls 
out a cloth and begins dusting the table.  By now Eddie has assumed 
his position in Martin’s chair.  Frasier wanders in and sees Daphne 
"hard at work".]

Frasier: Afternoon, Daphne.
 Daphne: Hello. [throws Eddie a biscuit] Good dog!  Oh, Dr. Crane.  
         It’s a good thing you’re home.  Mr. Houghton is dropping by 
         to pick your father up for the Mariners game.
Frasier: You serious?  He’s coming back?
 Daphne: Yes.  Any minute.  It’s a double header. [Frasier looks 
         blankly at her] They play two games!
Frasier: Oh right, right.  This is incredibly good fortune.  I 
         finally get to spend some time alone with the man, even if 
         just for a few minutes.

[The doorbell rings.]

Frasier: Daphne, be a dear and stall Dad, will you?  If he gives you 
         any trouble just hide his cane.

[Frasier opens the door full of expectation but is greeted by Niles 
instead.]

Frasier: Niles!  What fortuitous timing.  Er... you know the wine 
         shop just called a moment ago?  It seems they’re down to 
         their last two cases of the ’82 Chambolle-Musigny, so why 
         don’t you dash right down there and stack it all up?
  Niles: Okay. [just as the door is about to shut on him] Hold it! 
         [looks suspiciously at Frasier] You know very well that in 
         1982 there was a drought in Bourgogne.  The locals dubbed it 
         "The Year of the Raisin."  And that wine was never sold by 
         the case, only by the bottle [forces his way in] T.H. 
         Houghton is here, isn’t he?
Frasier: No.
  Niles: Fine.  Then you won’t mind if I just hang around for a while.
Frasier: Oh, all right.  He’s on his way.  He and Dad are going to a


         baseball game.  It’s a double header. [Niles looks blankly 
         at him] They play two games!
 Martin: [emerging from his bedroom] Hi, Niles.
  Niles: Oh, Dad.  So I hear that Mr. Houghton is on his way over. 
         Maybe we could all have lunch before you head off.
Frasier: Oh, that’s a splendid idea.
 Martin: Nah, game starts in 45 minutes.
Frasier: Well, then perhaps he could come by after the game for a 
         drink.
 Martin: Nah, sorry.  That won’t work either.  He’s got to go to his 
         publisher’s.  Drop off his new book.
Frasier: Houghton has a new book?
  Niles: [stunned] I’ve lost the feeling in my legs!
Frasier: Did he say anything about it?  The characters?  The setting?
 Martin: No.  He just said it was a book.
  Niles: Dad!  You have to skip the game.  It’s not just for our 
         benefit.  After all, it’s baseball.  The man must be starved 
         for intellectual stimulation.
 Martin: Oh, I know what you’re saying – that someone like that would 
         have to prefer spending time with you than some dumbbell 
         like me.
Frasier: Dad – you’re not dumb.  You miss the point entirely!  Look, 
         let’s just say, for example, you came home one afternoon and 
         I was sitting here discussing literature with... oh, I don’t 
         know.  Give me the name of a baseball player.
 Martin: Darryl Strawberry.
Frasier: No, a real one!
 Martin: Frasier, the problem is, you push too hard.  We just talk 
         sports, have a few laughs.  That’s all.  I don’t ask him 
         about his work – that’s probably why he told me about the 
         book.

[The doorbell rings and Frasier goes to answer pondering Martin’s 
words.  It’s T.H. Houghton.]

 Frasier: Mr. Houghton.  Hello.
Houghton: Hi.  How you doing?
  Martin: Hey, Ted.  Come on in.
 Frasier: So you two boys are off to the baseball game, huh?  Double 
          header.
   Niles: [proudly] That’s two games!
Houghton: Yeah.
   Niles: Little known fact about baseball: the owner of the Boston 
          Red Sox sold Babe Ruth to the New York Yankees to finance a 
          Broadway musical, "No No Nanette"
Houghton: [after a period of silence] You ready, Marty?
  Martin: Let’s go.
 Frasier: I really enjoyed chatting with you.  Maybe you could drop 
          back by after the game.  We could pick up where we left off...

[Frasier's words are left trailing as Martin and Houghton leave.]

Frasier: [sarcastically] No No Nanette!
  Niles: I’m sorry.  There are exactly two things that I could 
         possibly add to a baseball conversation.  That, and... no, 
         just the one.

[Both Frasier and Niles collapse on the sofa and lie back.]

  Niles: Frasier.
Frasier: Yes.
  Niles: Have you noticed how Houghton always carries a satchel with 
         him wherever he goes?


Frasier: Well, actually as a matter of fact I have.
  Niles: And didn’t Dad mention that Houghton was on his way to his 
         publisher’s after the game with a new manuscript?
Frasier: [bored] Yes.
  Niles: And would that be the very same satchel, which is now 
         resting under my head?
Frasier: Oh my God!

[Frasier and Niles both leap up to see that Houghton has indeed left 
his manuscript on the arm of the sofa.  They run up and Niles is about 
to examine it.]

Frasier: Wait! 
  Niles: Should we?
Frasier: We shouldn’t.
  Niles: Could we live with ourselves if we did?
Frasier: Could we live with ourselves if we didn’t?
  Niles: Could we live with ourselves either way?
Frasier: Oh, stop it, Niles.  Who are we kidding?

[Frasier makes a grab for the manuscript but Niles stops him and 
pulls the manuscript delicately out of the satchel.  Frasier goes and 
checks the front door.  Niles has already placed the manuscript on 
the table and ever so slowly pulls the cover off.]

Frasier: "The Chameleon's Song," by T.H. Houghton.
  Niles: These are hand-written corrections.  Frasier – this is his 
         original manuscript!

[Daphne walks out from the bedroom.]

 Daphne: Shame on you! [Frasier and Niles both look extremely guilty] 
         Going through someone else’s personal property!  Well, it’s 
         just plain wrong and I know your father wouldn’t approve.  
         Of course I wouldn’t be here to tell him if I had the day 
         off...
Frasier: Fine, go.
 Daphne: [grabbing her jacket] Great!  Although having a day off is 
         pretty meaningless when you have no money to, you know, 
         maybe go to lunch or do some shopping, perhaps take in a 
         show... [takes money off Frasier as she walks past and out 
         the door] Oh, thanks!
Frasier: All right, Niles.  Shall we?
  Niles: Not yet.  The atmosphere has to be absolutely perfect.
Frasier: Good point. [goes to the light dimmer switch] Let’s begin 
         with the lighting.
  Niles: Warmer. [Frasier turns the switch a tad] Warmer. [Frasier 
         turns again] A little cooler. [Frasier turns again] A touch 
         warmer. [Frasier turns again] A hair back. [Frasier gives up 
         and goes over to the drinks cabinet whilst Niles, still 
         concentrating on the lighting keeps on talking] No, no, a 
         hair the other way.  No, a touch warmer.  Perfect.
Frasier: [from the drinks cabinet] Good!
  Niles: Ooh excellent, excellent.  What wine would most enhance the 
         experience?
Frasier: No, Niles.  Wine might dull our faculties.  Perhaps instead 
         a slow sipping cordial would be the proper garnish.
  Niles: Sherry?
Frasier: Armagnac.
  Niles: Oh, well see?  That’s why you’re the older brother.

[Frasier pours himself and Niles a glass and both sit down at the 
table with the manuscript in front of them.]


[The scene SWITCHES to a little later and both are engrossed in the 
story.]

Frasier: [nearly crying] Ooh!
  Niles: What is it?
Frasier: I don’t think you’re there yet.
  Niles: [after a pause, then nearly crying] Ooh!

[The scene SWITCHES to later still and Frasier and Niles are both 
finishing the story.  They sit back gobsmacked.]

Frasier: Well... it’s a masterpiece.

[Eddie, who is standing at the front door, barks.]

Niles: Eddie! [to Frasier] I never thought I’d utter these words but 
       it actually surpasses "Time Flies Tomorrow."

[Eddie, still at the front door, barks twice.]

Frasier: [annoyed] Eddie, please!  I’m trying to savour the moment.

[Eddie suddenly dashes off and, needless to say, the front door opens 
as Martin and Houghton enter.  Frasier and Niles quickly go about 
trying to hide the evidence and put the manuscript back in the 
satchel but are caught.]

   Niles: [innocently] How was the game?
Houghton: Is that my manuscript?
  Martin: What the hell’s going on?
Houghton: You went through my bag?  That’s my personal property.
  Martin: I don’t believe you two.
 Frasier: Mr. Houghton, please.  We are terribly, terribly sorry.
   Niles: The temptation to read it was just too great.
  Martin: What’s that supposed to mean?  You’re grown men, both of 
          you.  At least I thought you were.  You had no right to 
          touch that.  Ted, I’m sorry.  I’m just so ashamed.
Houghton: Marty, it’s all right.
  Martin: No, it’s not all right.
Houghton: No, no, it’s OK.  Really.  Somebody had to read it first.  
          So what did you think?
   Niles: Of the book?
Houghton: No, of my typing.  Yes, of course of the book.
   Niles: Well... s'great.
 Frasier: Er... Wow!
Houghton: Well, at least you liked it.  I’m going to have to be 
          running.
  Martin: Are you sure?  I was going to make some coffee.
Houghton: No, no.  I got an appointment.  Can I use the...
  Martin: [pointing towards the bathroom] Right there.

[Houghton goes into the bathroom while Martin looks angrily at the 
boys.]

 Martin: Boy, I’ve had it with you guys.  If you were "Hoss" and 
         Little Joe, Ben Cartwright would kick your sorry butts right 
         off the Ponderosa. 
Frasier: Dad.  Dad, we’re sorry.
  Niles: Very sorry.

[Martin goes into the kitchen leaving the boys alone with their 
thoughts.]


Frasier: He’s back on the Cartwrights again.  You know, some day we 
         really should ask him just who the hell they are?  You know, 
         Niles, one thing just really bugs me.  Houghton is going to 
         leave here today thinking we’re just a couple of 
         inarticulate simpletons.
  Niles: What with those pithy comments we made about his 
         masterpiece.  Great.  "Wow."
Frasier: We’ll go down in history with the same baboon who first read 
         "Hamlet" and told Shakespeare "My goodness.  What a parchment 
         turn!"
  Niles: It’s not too late.  He hasn’t left yet.
Frasier: Yes, yes.  We could still say something to show him that we 
         appreciated the full complexity of his work.

[Houghton emerges from the bathroom.]

 Frasier: Mr. Houghton, you know, there is one further thing I’d like 
          to add about your book.
Houghton: Yeah?
 Frasier: Well, it’s the way you modulated into the second person 
          narrative during the flashback scene.  Frankly, it beggars 
          anything Faulkner attempted.
Houghton: Really?  That’s very flattering.
   Niles: Wait, I have one too.  The way you so skilfully mirrored 
          the structure of Dante’s "Divine Comedy" was inspired.
Houghton: Really?
 Frasier: Yes, yes.  But the inferno of the bordello...
   Niles: Which we noticed had exactly nine rooms!
 Frasier: Uh-huh.  To the purgatory of the assembly line and finally 
          to the paradise of the farm.
Houghton: You both saw that?
   Niles: Oh, it practically jumped off the page.
Houghton: Well, that’s very perceptive of you.
 Frasier: Well, thank you.  Our turn to be flattered.
Houghton: You’re absolutely right.  This whole book is crap!
   Niles: Beg your pardon?
Houghton: How could I be so blind?  I lifted the entire structure 
          from Dante.
   Niles: Oh, you mean you weren’t going for that.
Houghton: Of course not.  This confirms my worst fear.  I have nothing 
          original left to say.  I’m an empty shell.  I was a fool to 
          think I had a second book in me. [reading from his 
          manuscript] "The winters were harsh on the farm."  Well, 
          here’s something to warm them up. [starts throwing the pages 
          into the fire]
  Martin: [coming in from the kitchen] What’s going on here?
Houghton: You’re both right.  I’m a talentless hack who got lucky 
          once.
 Frasier: Dad, we didn’t say that.
  Martin: You’re not listening to these two, are you?
Houghton: Look at this trash.  It won’t even burn. 
 Frasier: Well, it’s a fireplace, you see.  It’s not well ventilated.
Houghton: This book doesn’t belong in a fireplace.  It belongs in the 
          gutter with the rest of society’s garbage.

[Houghton heads out to the balcony followed swiftly by Martin, 
Frasier and Niles, all protesting vehemently.  However it is of no use 
and Houghton throws the entire manuscript over the railing and out 
onto the streets below.]

Houghton: I want to thank you two.  If I had published that book my 
          reputation would have been destroyed.  At least now I’m left 


          with a shred of dignity.

[Houghton walks off but unfortunately, given his last speech, a page 
is stuck to his shoe, which he doesn’t notice.  Niles goes to say 
something but Frasier stops him.]

Martin: Happy?  Hey, Ted.  Wait up.

[Martin follows Houghton outside leaving the boys alone once again.]

Frasier: Well, we’ve destroyed a man’s life.
  Niles: Not to mention depriving future generations of a work of 
         art.
Frasier: Well, you know on the other hand, had he actually published 
         it the critics surely would have noticed that Dante 
         parallel.
  Niles: Hmm.  If he felt bad hearing it from us, imagine how he would 
         have felt reading it in the "New York Review of Books."
Frasier: Oh God, yes.  With his fragile ego he would have been 
         completely devastated.
  Niles: Who knows what he might have done?
Frasier: You know, Niles... we saved that man’s life.
  Niles: Yes, I think you’re right. [then] On the other hand...
Frasier: Don’t go there!
  Niles: See, that’s why you’re the older brother.

[End of Act 2]

Credits:

Daphne is busy keeping watch through the peephole while Eddie rolls 
about on the sofa.  Suddenly she turns and gives a whistle and Eddie 
immediately stops and assumes the position on Martin’s chair. 
Meanwhile Daphne gets back to her cleaning.  Frasier walks in and 
smiles at Daphne.  However he becomes bemused by the whole 
tranquillity of the scene and just stares at the two of them 
suspiciously.
