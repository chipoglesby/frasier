"Frasier: Listen to yourself, Bob You follow her to work, you eavesdrop on her calls, you open her mail. The minute you started doing these things, the relationship was over Roz, I think we have time for one more? "
"Roz: Yes, Dr Crane. On line four, we have Russell from Kirkland. "
"Frasier: Hello, Russell. This is Dr Frasier Crane; I'm listening. "
"Russell: Well, I've been feeling sort of, uh, you know, depressed lately. My life's not going anywhere and-and, er, it's not that bad. It's just the same old apartment, same old job... "
"Frasier: Er, Russell, we're just about at the end of our hour. Let me see if I can cut to the chase by using myself as an example. Six months ago, I was living in Boston. My wife had left me, which was very painful. Then she came back to me, which was excruciating. On top of that, my practice had grown stagnant, and my social life consisted of... hanging around a bar night after night. You see, I was clinging to a life that wasn't working anymore, and I knew I had to do something, anything. So, I ended the marriage once and for all, packed up my things, and moved back here to my hometown of Seattle. Go Seahawks I took action, Russell. And you can, too. Move, change, do something; if it's a mistake, do something else. Will you do that, Russell? Will you? Russell...? I think we lost him. "
"Roz: No, we cut to the news thirty seconds ago. "
"Frasier: Oh, for crying out loud I finally bare my soul to all of Seattle, and they're listening to Chopper Dave's 'Rush-Hour Round-Up' "
"Frasier: Well, the rest of the show was pretty good. [Roz says nothing] It was a, a good show, wasn't it? "
"Roz: Here, your brother called. "
"Frasier: Roz, in the trade we call that 'avoidance.' Don't change the subject, tell me what you think. "
"Roz: Did I ever tell you what this little button does? "
"Frasier: I am not a piece of Lalique. I can handle criticism. How was I today? "
"Roz: Let's see... you dropped two commercials, you left a total of twenty-eight seconds of dead air, you scrambled the station's call letters, you spilled yogurt on the control board, and you kept referring to Jerry - with the identity crisis - as 'Jeff.' "
"Frasier: You say my brother called... "
"Roz: Mmm-hmm. "
"Niles: So I said to the gardener, 'Yoshi, I do not want a Zen garden in my backyard. If I want to rake gravel every ten minutes to maintain my inner harmony, I'll move to Yokohama.' Well, this offends him, so he starts pulling up Maris's prized Camellias. Well, I couldn't stand for that, so I marched right into the morning room and locked the door until he cooled down. "
"Niles: Tell me you would have handled it differently, Frasier. "
"Frasier: Oh, I'm sorry, Niles, I didn't realise you'd stopped talking. "
"Niles: You haven't heard a word I said. "
"Frasier: Oh Niles, you're a psychiatrist - you know what it's like to listen to people prattling on endlessly about their mundane lives. "
"Niles: Touché. And on that subject, I heard your show today. "
"Frasier: And? "
"Niles: You know what I think about pop psychiatry. "
"Frasier: Yes, I know what you think about everything. When was the last time you had an unexpressed thought? "
"Niles: I'm having one now. "
"Waitress: You guys ready? "
"Frasier: Two cafe latte supremos. "
"Frasier: No, thank you. "
"Niles: So, Frasier. How are you doing on your own? "
"Frasier: I'm fine. I love my new life. I love the solitude. I miss Frederick like the dickens, of course. You know, he's quite a boy. He's playing goalie on the peewee soccer team now. Ha, he's a chip off the old block "
"Niles: You hated sports. "
"Frasier: So does he The fresh air's good for him. "
"Niles: Oh well, this has been fun, Frasier, but... we have a problem, and that's why I thought we should talk. "
"Frasier: Is it Dad? "
"Niles: Afraid so. One of his old buddies from the police force called this morning. He went over to see him, and found him on the bathroom floor. "
"Frasier: Oh my God "
"Niles: No, it's okay, he's fine. "
"Frasier: What, his hip again? "
"Niles: Frasier, I don't think he can live alone anymore. "
"Frasier: What can we do? "
"Niles: Well, I know this isn't going to be anyone's favourite solution, but I took the liberty of checking out a few convalescent homes for him. [puts some brochures on the table] "
"Frasier: Oh Niles, a home? He's still a young man "
"Niles: Well, you certainly can't take care of him - you're just getting your new life together. "
"Frasier: Absolutely. Besides, we were never simpatico. "
"Niles: Of course, I can't take care of him. "
"Frasier: Oh yes, yes, of course, of course... why? "
"Niles: Because Dad doesn't get along with Maris. "
"Frasier: Who does? "
"Niles: I thought you liked my Maris "
"Frasier: I do. I... I like her from a distance. You know, the way you like the sun. Maris is like the sun. Except without the warmth. "
"Niles: Well then, we're agreed about what to do with Dad. [reads a brochure] 'Golden "
"Acres: We Care So You Don't Have To.' "
"Frasier: It says that? "
"Niles: Well, it might as well "
"Frasier: Alright, I'll make up the spare bedroom. "
"Niles: Oh, you're a good son, Frasier. "
"Frasier: Oh God, I am, aren't I? "
"Waitress: Two cafe supremos. Anything to eat? "
"Frasier: No. I seem to have lost my appetite. "
"Niles: I'll have a large piece of cheesecake "
"TO: "
"apartment: "
"Frasier: "
"Niles: We finally made it "
"Frasier: Ah Dad, Dad, welcome to your new home Gee, you look great "
"Martin: Don't B.S. me, I do not look great. I spent Monday on the bathroom floor. You can still see the tile marks on my face. "
"Niles: Gives you some idea about the ride over in the car. "
"Frasier: Well, er, here we are... "
"Frasier: Well, rest assured the refrigerator is stocked with your favourite beer, Ballantines, [places the glass ornament on a small folding table] and we've got plenty of hot links and coleslaw... "
"Niles: Mmm "
"Frasier: And I just rented a Charles Bronson movie for later "
"Martin: Let's cut the 'Welcome To Camp Crane' speech. We all know why I'm here. Your old man can't be left alone for ten minutes without falling on his ass, and Frasier got stuck with me. Isn't that right? "
"Niles: No, no "
"Frasier: I want you here It'll give us a chance to get reacquainted "
"Martin: That implies we were acquainted at one point. "
"Niles: Well listen, why don't I take Dad's things into his new bachelor quarters so you two scoundrels can plan some hijinks "
"Martin: I think that wife of his is finally driving him nutso. "
"Frasier: Yes, we Crane boys sure know how to marry. [goes to the kitchen] Let me get you a beer, Dad. So, ah, what do you think of what I've done with the place, eh? [returns and sits on the couch, handing a beer to Martin] You know, every item here was carefully selected. This lamp by Corbusier, the chair by Eames, and this couch is an exact replica of the one Coco Chanel had in her Paris atelier. "
"Martin: Nothing matches. "
"Frasier: Well, it's a, it's a style of decorating, it's called 'eclectic.' Well, the theory behind it is, if you've got really fine pieces of furniture, it doesn't matter if they match - they will go together. "
"Martin: It's your money. "
"Frasier: Dad, what do you think of the view? Hey, that's the Space Needle there "
"Martin: Oh, thanks for pointing that out. Being born and raised here, I never would have known. "
"Man: Delivery for Martin Crane. "
"Martin: Oh, in here "
"Man: Coming through "
"Frasier: Excuse me, excuse me, wait a minute- "
"Man: Where d'you want it? "
"Martin: Where's the TV? "
"Niles: It's in that credenza. "
"Martin: Point it at that thing. "
"Man: What about this chair? "
"Niles: Ah, the chair? Here, let me get it out of your way. "
"Frasier: Niles, Niles, Niles, be careful with that, that's a Wassily "
"Frasier: Oh look, Dad, as dear as I'm sure this, this piece is to you I, I just don't think it goes with anything here "
"Martin: I know, it's eclectic "
"Frasier: Niles, Niles, will you help me out here? "
"Martin: Ah, you're gonna have to run an extension cord over here so I can plug in the vibrating part. "
"Frasier: Oh yes, that will be the crowning touch. "
"Niles: Well, now that you two are settled in, I've got to run. I'm late for my dysfunctional family seminar. "
"Niles: Dad, have you mentioned Eddie yet? "
"Frasier: Eddie? "
"Niles: Ta-ta "
"Frasier: Oh no, Dad, no, no Not Eddie "
"Martin: But he's my best friend Get me my beer, would you? "
"Frasier: But he's weird He gives me the creeps All he does is stare at me. "
"Martin: Ah, it's just your imagination. "
"Frasier: No Dad, no No, I'm sorry, but I am putting my foot down. Eddie is NOT moving in here. "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Niles, there you are I'm sorry I'm late; just as I was leaving, Dad decided to cook lunch by the glow of a small kitchen fire Oh Niles, this last week with Dad, it's, it's been a living hell When I'm there, I feel like my territory's being violated; when I'm not, I'm worried about what he's up to. Look at me, I'm a nervous wreck I've got to do something to calm down. Double espresso, please Niles, you don't still have the brochures from those rest homes, do you? "
"Niles: Of course I do. Don't forget, Maris is five years older than I am. But you really think that's necessary? "
"Frasier: I'm afraid I do. I don't have my life anymore. Tuesday night I gave up my tickets to the theatre, Wednesday it was the symphony... "
"Niles: That reminds me, weren't you going to the opera on Friday? "
"Frasier: Yes, here. "
"Niles: Thank you. "
"Frasier: Niles, you don't suppose there's a chance that you and Maris could... "
"Niles: Funny you should mention that. Maris and I were just discussing this. We feel we should do more to share the responsibility. "
"Frasier: You mean you'd take him in? "
"Niles: Dear God, no But we would be willing to help you pay for a home care worker. "
"Frasier: A what? "
"Niles: You know, someone who cooks and cleans and can help Dad with his physical therapy. "
"Frasier: These angels exist? "
"Niles: I know of an agency - let me arrange for them to send a few people over to meet with you. "
"Frasier: Niles, I can't thank you enough I, I, I feel this overwhelming urge to hug you "
"Niles: Remember what Mom always "
"said: 'A handshake is as good as a hug.' "
"Frasier: Wise woman. "
"TO: "
"Frasier: I have never been more impressed with a human being in my life "
"Frasier: Now what was wrong with that one? "
"Martin: She was casing the joint. "
"Frasier: 'Casing the joint' She spent two years with Mother Teresa "
"Martin: Well, if I were Mother Teresa, I'd check my jewellery box "
"Frasier: Oh, this is the last one. Can you please try to keep an open mind? "
"Daphne: Oh Hello - caught me with my hand in the biscuit tin I'm Daphne, Daphne Moon. "
"Frasier: Frasier Crane. Please come in. "
"Daphne: Thank you. "
"Frasier: Er, this is my father, Martin Crane. Dad, this is Daphne Moon. "
"Daphne: Nice to meet you. Oh, and who might this be? "
"Frasier: That is Eddie. "
"Martin: I call him 'Eddie Spaghetti.' "
"Daphne: Oh, he likes pasta? "
"Martin: No, he has worms. "
"Frasier: Er, have a seat, Miss Moon. "
"Daphne: Daphne. Thank you. Oh, will you look at that. What a comfy chair It's like I always say, start with a good piece and replace the rest when you can afford it. "
"Frasier: Yes. Well, er, perhaps you should start by telling us a little bit about yourself, Miss Moon. "
"Daphne: Well, I'm originally from Manchester, England... "
"Frasier: Oh really, did you hear that, Dad? "
"Martin: I'm three feet away. There's nothing wrong with my hearing. "
"bag: a brush, a "
"Daphne: I've only been in the U.S. for a few months, but I have quite an extensive background in home care and physical therapy, as you can see from my resume. I... You were a policeman, weren't you? "
"Martin: Yeah - how'd you know? "
"Daphne: I must confess - I'm a bit psychic. It's nothing big, just little things I sense about people. I mean, it's not like I can pick the lottery. If I could, I wouldn't be talking to the likes of you two, now would I? "
"Frasier: Yes. Perhaps I should describe the duties around here. You would be responsible for... "
"Daphne: Oh, wait a minute, I'm getting something on you... you're a florist "
"Frasier: No, I'm a psychiatrist. "
"Daphne: Well, it comes and goes. Usually, it's strongest during my time of the month. Oh, I guess I let a little secret out there, didn't I? "
"Frasier: It's safe with us. Well, Miss Moon, I think we've learned just about all we need to know about you, and a dash extra "
"Daphne: You're a dog, aren't you? "
"Frasier: Well, we'll, er, we'll be calling you, Miss Moon. [goes for the door handle] "
"Martin: Oh, why wait? You've got the job "
"Daphne: Oh, wonderful "
"Frasier: Er excuse me, excuse me, aren't you just forgetting a little something here? Don't you think we should talk about this in private? "
"Daphne: Oh, of course you should; I completely understand. [she stands up and shoulders her bag] I'll just pop into the loo - you do have one, don't you? "
"Frasier: Yes. "
"Daphne: Oh, I love America... "
"shut: "
"Frasier: Dad, what do you think you're doing? "
"Martin: You wanted me to pick one, I picked one. "
"Frasier: But she's a kook I don't like her "
"Martin: Well, what difference does it make to you? She's only gonna be here when you're not. "
"Frasier: Then... what's my problem? Daphne "
"Frasier: You've been retained. "
"Daphne: Oh, wonderful I had a premonition. "
"Frasier: Quelle surprise. "
"Daphne: I'll move my things in tomorrow. "
"Frasier: Oh, move in? Oh, I'm sorry, there must be some misunderstanding. Er, this isn't a live-in position. "
"Daphne: Oh, dear. Well the lady at the agency- "
"Frasier: The lady at the agency was wrong; this is just a part-time position. I'm, I'm afraid it just won't work out. "
"Martin: Hold on there, Frasier, let's talk about this "
"Frasier: Dad, there's nothing to discuss "
"Daphne: You two should talk about this. I'll just pop back in here and enjoy some more of your African erotic art. "
"Frasier: Daphne, Daphne - I think it would be best if you leave. "
"Daphne: Oh well, alright then. "
"Frasier: Don't be alarmed. We'll contact you. If not by telephone then, er, through the toaster. "
"Frasier: Dad, I'm not having another person living in this house "
"Martin: Give me one good reason why not "
"Frasier: Well, for one thing, there's no room for her "
"Martin: What about that room right across the hall from mine? "
"Frasier: My study? You expect me to give up my study - the place where I read, where I do my most profound thinking? "
"Martin: Ah, use the can like the rest of the world You'll adjust "
"Frasier: I don't want to adjust I've done enough adjusting I'm in a new city, I've got a new job, I'm separated from my little boy, which in itself is enough to drive me nuts. And now my father and his dog are living with me Well, that's enough on my plate, thank you. The whole idea of getting somebody in here was to help ease my burden, not to add to it "
"Martin: Oh, do you hear that, Eddie? We're a burden. "
"Frasier: Oh Dad, Dad, you're, you're twisting my words I meant burden in its most positive sense "
"Martin: As in, 'Gee, what a lovely burden?' "
"Frasier: Something like that, yes "
"Martin: Well, you're not the only one who got screwed here, you know. Two years ago I'm sailing toward retirement and some punk robbing a convenience store puts a bullet in my hip. Next thing you know, I'm trading in my golf clubs for one of these. Well, I had plans too, you know And this may come as a shock to you, sonny boy, but one of them wasn't living with you. "
"Frasier: I'm just trying to do the right thing, here. I'm trying to be the good son. "
"Martin: Oh, don't worry, son. After I'm gone you can live guilt-free, knowing you've done right by your pop. "
"Frasier: You think that's what this is about, guilt? "
"Martin: Isn't it? "
"Frasier: Of course it is But the point is, I did it I took you in And I've got news for you - I wanted to do it [on the verge of tears] Because you're my father. And how do you repay me? Ever since you've moved in here it's been a snide comment about this or a smart little put-down about that. [grabs his coat and goes to the door] Well, I've done my best to make a home here for you, and once, just once, would it have killed you to say 'thank you?' One lousy 'thank you?' "
"Martin: Come on, Eddie, it's past your dinner time. "
"Frasier: I'm going out. "
"TO: "
"Frasier: They have got to move the bathroom closer to the studio "
"Frasier: We'll be right back after these messages. Can't I put that on tape? "
"Roz: What's eating you? "
"Frasier: Oh, I'm sorry. It's just this thing with my father and this, this person he wants to hire. I thought I'd started my life with a clean slate. I had picture of what it was going to be like, and then, I don't know... "
"Roz: Ever heard of Lupe Velez? "
"Frasier: Who? "
"Roz: Lupe Velez - the movie star in the '30s. Well, her career hit the skids, so she decided she'd make one final stab at immortality. She figured if she couldn't be remembered for her movies, she'd be remembered for the way she died. And all Lupe wanted was to be remembered. So, she plans this lavish suicide - flowers, candles, silk sheets, white satin gown, full hair and makeup, the works. She takes the overdose of pills, lays on the bed, and imagines how beautiful she's going to look on the front page of tomorrow's newspaper. Unfortunately, the pills don't sit well with the enchilada combo plate she sadly chose as her last meal. She stumbles to the bathroom, trips and goes head-first into the toilet, and that's how they found her. "
"Frasier: Is there a reason you're telling me this story? "
"Roz: Yes. Even though things may not happen like we planned, they can work out anyway. "
"Frasier: Remind me again how it worked for Lupe, last seen with her head in the toilet? "
"Roz: All she wanted was to be remembered. Will you ever forget that story? "
"Frasier: We're back. Roz, who's our next caller? "
"Roz: We have Martin on line one. He's having a problem with his son. "
"Frasier: Hello, Martin. This is Dr. Frasier Crane; I'm listening. "
"Martin: I'm a first-time caller. "
"Frasier: Welcome to the show. How can I help you? "
"Martin: I've just moved in with my son and er, it ain't working. There's a lot of tension between us. "
"Frasier: I can imagine. Why do you think that's so? "
"Martin: I guess I didn't see he had a whole new life planned for himself, and I kinda got in the way. "
"Frasier: Well, these things are a two-way street. Perhaps your son wasn't sensitive enough to see how your life was changing. "
"Martin: You got that right I've been telling him that since I got there "
"Frasier: I'm sure he appreciated your candour. "
"Martin: Well, maybe sometimes I oughta just learn how to keep my trap shut. "
"Frasier: That's good advice for us all. Anything else? "
"Martin: Yeah, I'm worried my son doesn't know that I really appreciate what he's doing for me. "
"Frasier: Why don't you tell him? "
"Martin: Well, you know how it is with fathers and sons, it... I have trouble saying that stuff. "
"Frasier: Well, if it helps, I suspect your son already knows how you feel. Is that all? "
"Martin: Yeah, I guess that's it. Thank you, Dr Crane. "
"Frasier: My pleasure, Martin. "
"Martin: Did you hear what I said? I said 'thank you' "
"Frasier: Yes, I heard. "
"Roz: Dr Crane, we have Claire on line four. She's having a problem getting over a relationship. "
"Frasier: Hello, Claire. I'm listening. "
"Claire: I'm a, well, I'm a mess Eight months ago my boyfriend and I broke up, and I just can't get over it. The pain isn't going away. It's almost like I'm in mourning or something. "
"Frasier: Claire, you are in mourning. But you're not mourning the loss of your boyfriend. You're mourning the loss of what you thought your life was going to be. Let it go. Things don't always work out how you planned; that's not necessarily bad. Things have a way of working out anyway. Have you ever heard of Lupe Velez? "
"Credits: "
" "
"A: The Frasier Residence, early morning. "
"Daphne: Oh, good morning, Dr. Crane. Not a morning person, are we? Well, never you mind. I am. Can't very well be a good health care provider if you're not up with the cock. I've already taken your father for his morning constitutional. Such a remarkable man - thirty years on the police force. I can understand why you'd want him to live here, although not many sons would do that, not without getting paid for it. Anyway, coffee's made, and I took the liberty of doing a shop. They don't serve much tripe in Seattle, do they? "
"Frasier: And you are...? "
"Daphne: Daphne. Daphne Moon. I moved in yesterday. You hired me to take care of your father. "
"Frasier: Of course. Forgive me, I'm not quite myself until I've shaved and showered. "
"Daphne: Oh, yes. I completely understand about one's morning ablutions. I, for instance, can't stand myself 'til I floss all that gunk out of my teeth... "
"Frasier: Miss Moon For future reference, if you could just keep your ablutions on a need-to-know basis? Thank you. Now, my coffee. "
"Martin: The half 'n half's curdled, and the garbage disposal's jammed. "
"Frasier: Good morning to you too, dad. "
"Martin: Morning was two hours ago. And close that barn door, we got a lady in the house now. "
"Frasier: Hey, this isn't my coffee. Where's my finely-ground Kenya blend from Starbucks? "
"Martin: That's it. Daphne put an eggshell and some allspice in it. "
"Frasier: Didn't that just dress it up? "
"Martin: I like it. Gives it a zing. Now, come on, sit down. Your breakfast is ready. "
"Frasier: Oh, no, dad, dad, look, all I ever have is a bran muffin, and a touch of yogurt. "
"Martin: Ah, girlie food. Besides, I already fixed your breakfast. Now, I made you “Eggs in a Nest.” "
"Frasier: Ah yes, the Crane family specialty. Fried eggs swimming in fat, served in a delightfully hollowed-out piece of white bread. I can almost hear my left ventricle slamming shut as I speak. "
"Martin: You want cheese on that? "
"Frasier: No. I'd like to leave some blood flow for the clot to go swiftly to my brain. Can't have my coffee, can't have my breakfast, Oh god, it wasn't a dream. I'll get him for this. And his little dog, too. [opens front door] Where's my paper? Who's stolen my paper? Mrs. Everly, you old bat, I know it's you "
"Daphne: Yoo-hoo? It's right here, we brought it in for you. "
"Frasier: Sorry, sorry. [closes door and examines paper] Oh, wait a minute, this... where's the rubber band? This paper has been read. "
"Daphne: Well don't worry, we won't tell you what's in it. "
"Frasier: That is not the point. Dad, dad? Come and sit down please, would you? "
"Daphne: You're going to give a speech, aren't you? "
"Frasier: Oh, that's right, I forgot, you're psychic. "
"Daphne: Yes, but I think anyone could feel this one coming on. "
"Frasier: Let us get something clear. I am not a morning person. I have to ease into my day slowly. First I have my coffee - sans eggshells or anything else one tends to pick out of the garbage. Then I have a low-fat, high-fiber breakfast. Finally I sit down and read a crisp, new newspaper. If I am robbed of the richness of my morning routine, I cannot function. My radio show suffers, and like ripples in a pond, so do the many listeners that rely on my advise, to help them through their troubled lives. I'm sorry if this may sound priggish, but I have grown comfortable with this part of myself. It is the magic that is me. "
"Martin: Get used to it. "
"Daphne: I know this is a stressful time, and this is new for all of us, but I'm sure that soon we'll all be getting along swimmingly. Ooh, six more weeks of winter, I see. "
"Frasier: Down Eddie, down. I said down. Good boy Eddie, just get down. Good good, Eddie get down. Eddie, GET DOWN Dad, dad, I can't read my paper, Eddie's staring at me. "
"Martin: Why, you do make quite a picture in the morning. Just ignore him. "
"Frasier: I'm trying to. "
"Martin: I was talking to the dog. "
"Frasier: Don't even think about it "
"B: KACL "
"Frasier: You're listening to Dr. Frasier Crane. Our topic today is... intrusion. Those who encroach on our sense of personal space. The neighbor who plays his stereo too loud. The person who sits next to you in the movie theater when there are fifty other vacant seats. Now let's return to our calls, and let me remind you once more, that our topic today is intrusion, since so many of you seem to be forgetting that. "
"Roz: Dr. Crane, we have Leonard from Everett, on line two. "
"Frasier: Hello Leonard, I'm listening. "
"Leonard: Oh, hi Dr. Crane. Ah, I'm a little nervous, but ah... well, here goes. Several years ago I became afraid of large, open spaces. Like, if I went to the mall, I'd break out in a cold sweat, I'd get so scared that I'd have to run home. "
"Frasier: Yes Leonard, and your comments on intrusion? "
"Leonard: Nothing. Just that, now I'm afraid to go outside at all. I haven't seen another person in eight months. "
"Frasier: Well Leonard, it sounds like you may have a very serious condition known as agoraphobia. But you're not alone. "
"Leonard: But I am alone, Dr. Crane. "
"Frasier: Listen Leonard, I'm afraid your problem is too difficult to deal with in the time we have remaining, so if you stay on the line, someone will give you the name of a qualified therapist. Well, that's all the time we have for today. You've been listening to Dr. Frasier Crane, KACL 780. Stay tuned for the news. Then next up, Bob “Bulldog” Briscoe and the Gonzo Sports Show. I never miss it. Yeah, right. "
"Roz: You want your messages? "
"Frasier: Oh, listen Roz, just hang on to them. I think I'll stay in here for a while. Today more than most, I feel an overwhelming need for solitude. I've got a fascinating book here, a comfortable chair and a soundproof booth. "
"Bulldog: Hiya, doc. How're they hangin'? "
"Frasier: Bulldog, what are you doing here? "
"Bulldog: We lost transmitter link power in Studio C. I gotta do my show from here. "
"Bulldog: Hey, where the hell's my Cosell tape? Somebody stole my Cosell tape THIS STINKS THIS IS TOTAL B.S. THIS... oh, here it is. "
"Frasier: Let me just get out of your way. "
"Bulldog: Oh, by the way doc, doc, I heard what you said to that kid who fantasizes about killing his parents? You know what I would have told him? Sports. You go out there, break some heads- That'll turn him around. "
"Frasier: Yes. If only Jeffrey Dahmer had picked up a squash racquet. "
"Bulldog: Hey, where the hell's my Lasorda tape? THIS IS TOT... ah, got it. "
"Roz: Hold on a second, I have to ask you something. Gary? I broke up with him three weeks ago. The sex was okay, but he was kinda limited. No, no. It wasn't that Gary was bad in bed. I mean, he knew where all the parts were. Unfortunately, most of them were his. Yes, totally passionless, it was like he was thinking of someone else. I know I was. Somebody's here, I gotta go. Alright? Talk to you later. Bye, mom. "
"Frasier: That was your mother? "
"Roz: Yeah, why? "
"Frasier: You talk to your mother like that? "
"Roz: Well, we're both adults. We talk about everything. "
"Frasier: Well, isn't that healthy. "
"Roz: What, you don't talk to your dad like that? "
"Frasier: Oh, hardly. We hardly speak at all. "
"Roz: Really? "
"Frasier: Ah yes, well you know, we're just not really similar people. In fact, my brother and I are a lot more like my mother. You know, if it wasn't biologically impossible I'd swear that dad was dropped in a basket on our doorstep. "
"Bulldog: Hey sweetcakes, you seen my engineer? "
"Roz: I think someone's talking to you, Frasier. "
"Bulldog: Come on, come on, come on "
"Roz: So do you want to go across the street and have one of those expensive coffee drinks? "
"Frasier: Maybe some other time. Right now, I'd like to continue my quest for solitude. I'll go somewhere where my father, Mary Poppins and the hound from hell can't find me. I think maybe I'll just go sit under the shade of a tree and read in a quiet park. "
"TO: "
"C: Frasier's Apartment. "
"Frasier: Hello. Hello? Dad? Daphne? Eddie? Could it be? "
"Frasier: Toreador, Don't spit on the floor, Use the cuspidor-a What do you think it's for-a? "
"Daphne: ...so the elephant says, “He's with me.” [they both laugh] Oh, Dr. Crane, you're home. We just got back from your father's physical therapy. "
"Frasier: Oh, glory be. Oh, happy day. Not that I'm not delighted to see the two of you, it's just that I'm in the middle of a very exciting chapter. "
"Daphne: Ooh, I understand. So why don't I pop into the kitchen and brew you up a nice pot of tea? "
"Frasier: No, I just poured myself a glass of wine, thank you. "
"Daphne: "
"Martin: Whatcha reading? "
"Frasier: Oh dad, you wouldn't find it very interesting. "
"Martin: I might. Any good? "
"Frasier: Well, I haven't formed a opinion yet. Oddly enough, I'm having a little trouble getting into it. "
"Martin: Thick. "
"Frasier: Dad will you... Listen, I don't want to offend, but if you wouldn't mind, could you just leave me alone, let me read my book? "
"Martin: No problem. "
"Frasier: What are you doing? "
"Martin: I'm leaving you alone. "
"Frasier: Well, it's very annoying "
"Martin: Ah, what's your problem? You've been sucking a lemon all week. "
"Frasier: All right, all right, I'll tell you what my problem is, I can't get a moment’s peace alone in my own house. "
"Martin: Well, forgive me. When you invited me to move in I didn't realise I had to stay chained to the radiator in my room [starts to leave] "
"Frasier: Perhaps only evenings. "
"Martin: I heard that "
"Frasier: Well, of course you heard it, you're never out of earshot "
"Martin: Ah, you know, you've always been like this. You were always a fussy little kid, and it's gotten worse ever since. You and your precious morning routine. You gotta have your coffee, you gotta have your quiet, you gotta have this, you gotta have that. Well, aren't you the little hothouse orchid. "
"Frasier: Hey, hey-hey-hey I don't have to sit here and listen to that "
"Martin: Ah, if you want everything so perfect, why don't you go live in a bubble? "
"Frasier: Oh right, oh well, right now it sounds very inviting "
"Martin: Finally, a little peace and quiet around here. "
"A: Cafe Nervosa. "
"Niles: Hello there, Frasier. "
"Frasier: Oh, what fresh hell is this? "
"Niles: That's a nice way to greet your brother. Café latte, per piachere. "
"Frasier: I'm sorry, Niles, it's just I've been trying to read this book and it seems no matter where I alight I get interrupted. "
"Niles: Oh, “The Holotropic Mind” by Stanislav Grolf. I love his conclusion that a change in breathing patterns can induce alternate states of consciousness. "
"Frasier: Great. Now you've ruined the ending "
"Niles: I'm sorry, that was inconsiderate. Mille Grazie. So, how's father? "
"Frasier: Father? You mean the man who's driving me crazy? The man who makes me dread the sight of my very doorstep? The man who just drove me out of my own home? "
"Niles: And how's work? "
"Frasier: Niles, I don't know what I'm going to do. Dad and I had another fight. I'm afraid if we stay under the same roof together we'll do irreparable harm to the relationship we have as it is. "
"Niles: Well, what are the alternatives? "
"Frasier: Well, if I didn't feel so guilty I'd, I'd do what I should have done in the first "
"place: just move dad and Daphne into their own apartment. "
"Niles: Oh, for goodness sake, Frasier. It hasn't been that long, you have to give it a chance. And you might remember why you moved him in in the first place. "
"Frasier: Refresh me. "
"Niles: You wanted to get closer to dad. "
"Frasier: I still do. There isn't anything I'd like more, but he makes it impossible. I can't read my book, I can't have my coffee, I can't have any peace in my own home. "
"Niles: So what you’re saying is, you want to be closer to dad, but you don't actually want him around. Ask yourself Frasier, have you tried to sit down and talk to him - I mean, really talk to him? "
"Frasier: Well, I... Maybe I haven't done my best. I guess I owe that to the old man, don't I? Well ah, thanks for the chat, Niles. You're a good brother, and a credit to the psychiatric profession. "
"Niles: You're a good brother too. "
"B: Frasier's Apartment. "
"Frasier: Daphne? What are my things doing here? My leather wing chair? My Kusami lamp? "
"Daphne: We're putting them in the storage room, in the basement. There was no room for them in the study once we got my furniture in. We discussed it last night, remember? "
"Frasier: Of course, of course. "
"Daphne: I was just on my way to ask that peculiar little man from building services to give me a hand moving them. "
"Frasier: Oh yes, Kyle. Well, give him my regards. "
"Daphne: Remind me again - which one of Kyle's eyes is really looking at me? "
"Frasier: The brown one. "
"Martin: Daphne left your dinner in the fridge, if you're hungry. "
"Frasier: Well thanks, but I'm not. Ah... Dad, I'm sorry about the blow-up earlier. "
"Martin: Ah, forget about it. I already have. "
"Frasier: You know, I guess there's no secret that there's been a lot of tension between us, and I think maybe one of the reasons is that we never have a chance to sit down and talk. And I... I thought we might have a conversation. "
"Martin: Right now? "
"Frasier: Yes, I think now would be a good time. "
"Martin: Later would be better. "
"Frasier: It doesn't have to be a long, drawn-out conversation, I'm talking about three minutes of your life. "
"Martin: Well, I hope it is only three minutes, 'cause my program's coming on. "
"Frasier: Well, alright. If it'll make you any happier I will get the egg-timer and I will set it for three minutes. "
"Martin: So what do you want to talk about? "
"Frasier: Well, the idea is for us to have a normal, honest conversation like two normal people without getting on each other’s nerves. Ready? Go. "
"Martin: This is stupid. "
"Frasier: One second? That's our personal best? Let us see if we can beat it. Ready? Go. "
"Martin: So how about those Seahawks? "
"Frasier: No sports. "
"Martin: All right. But no opera. "
"Frasier: Agreed. Ready? Go. "
"Martin: This is your idea, you say something first. "
"Frasier: Alright, alright. I'll, I'll tell you something about myself that ah, that you don't know. Ah, six months ago, when Lilith and I were really on the rocks, ah, there was a time of depression I went through that was so terrible I actually climbed out on a ledge and wondered if life was worth living. I... And then I thought of Frederick. "
"Martin: And you didn't jump, huh? "
"Frasier: Good, dad. "
"Martin: Wow. I never knew that. "
"Frasier: Well, that's the point of this whole experiment. To tell one another something that we don't know about each other. Something vulnerable. Now it's your turn. "
"Martin: Okay. Well, about two months ago, I was in the basement, going through some old pictures of your mother and me... and all of a sudden something flew up in my eye. And, when I was trying to get it out, I realised I could turn my eyelid inside out, the way kids do at camp. "
"Frasier: That's it? You call that vulnerable? "
"Martin: It hurt. "
"Frasier: Oh well... I'm not talking about that kind of pain, I'm talking about your emotions, your soul. Some sort of painful, gut- wrenching experience. "
"Martin: Other than this one? "
"Frasier: Oh, God Always the flip answer. "
"Martin: Well, this whole thing's stupid. "
"Frasier: Well, not to me. Oh, how should I expect anything out of you? You are the most cold, intractable, unapproachable, distant, stubborn, cold man I've ever known "
"Martin: You said “cold” twice, Mr. Egghead. "
"Frasier: Egghead? Egghead? "
"Martin: You said “egghead” twice, too. "
"Frasier: Oh, you are so infuriating "
"Martin: Well, you're no day at the beach either. You know what you are? I'll tell you later, it's time for my program. "
"Frasier: Dad, I don't think you see how serious this is. "
"Martin: Oh, will you give it a rest? "
"Frasier: We're not getting along, and it's not getting any better. I'm not sure how to say this, but ah... I ah, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to... "
"Martin: I know what you're trying to say. “You want what's best for both of us.” You want to get me out of here, then you can have your own space, and I'll have my own space, and we can put an end to all this bickering. "
"Frasier: Well, yes. I guess it wasn't so hard to say after all. "
"Martin: Except for one thing. I'm not going. "
"Frasier: What? "
"Martin: Look, you want us to forge some great father-son relationship, to make some connection. Well, that kind of thing takes a couple of years, not a couple of days, doesn't it? You're the shrink. "
"Frasier: Couple of years, huh? "
"Martin: Ah, it'll go by before you know it. "
"Frasier: Either that, or it'll seem like eternity. "
"Martin: I'm willing to give it a shot if you are. "
"Frasier: Okay. "
"Martin: Great. How about you and me having a beer together? "
"Frasier: Wow. You know, in all these years you've never asked me that. I'd love to have a beer with you, dad. "
"Martin: Well then, you better haul ass, 'cause the store closes in ten minutes. "
"Frasier: Right. "

" THEY'RE HERE "
"Frasier: In the greater Seattle area, the number is 555-KACL. We've got a number of lines open, so please give us a call. Now who's up next, Roz? "
"Roz: We have Pam on line four. She's having a problem with her family. "
"Frasier: Hello, Pam. This is Dr Frasier Crane; I'm listening. "
"Pam: Hi. It's my in-laws. It's just that, well... they drop over all the time without calling first, and they expect us to stop what we're doing and entertain them. "
"Frasier: Well, they're your husband's parents - what does he suggest? "
"Pam: The other day, he had us drop to the floor and stay quiet until they drove away. "
"Frasier: A creative approach, but hardly a long-term solution. "
"Pam: Well I, I thought about saying something, but I'm afraid I'll hurt their feelings. "
"Frasier: Well, then you have a choice. Either you risk hurting their feelings, or you spend the rest of your life diving for cover whenever they happen to drop on by... "
"Pam: Shhh They're here "
"Frasier: Who... your in-laws? "
"Pam: Shh Yes. "
"Frasier: Well then, why don't you just take this opportunity to... Oh, for pete's sake Why don't you just tell them how you feel? "
"Pam: Okay Okay, I will next time, I promise Thanks, Dr. Crane. "
"Frasier: Yes... ah, well, as, er, Pam belly- crawls across her living room, let's take a moment for this message from... “Carpet Fresh.” "
"Frasier: How's that for a segue? "
"Frasier: I just don't think it's very smart to make rude gestures at other drivers "
"Martin: He cut you off "
"Frasier: That doesn't matter You, you do not antagonize a man whose bumper sticker says, “If you're close enough to read this, I'll kill you” "
"Martin: Big talk from a Volvo. "
"Daphne: I see you've found yourself a new suit. "
"Martin: Oh, wait till you see it, Daph - it's a beaut "
"Daphne: Let's have a look "
"Martin: Oh, can't let you see it on the hanger; I'll model it for you "
"Daphne: What a nice son you are, buying your father a new suit. "
"Frasier: Well, it didn't quite work out the way I planned, but er... Daphne, what are you doing? "
"Daphne: Fluffing your knickers. If you don't mind my saying so, you're losing some of your elasticity. "
"Frasier: Well, I appreciate everything you're doing, Daphne, but a man's knickers are certainly... Ooh... How'd you get them so... soft? "
"Daphne: Fabric softener and twice through the fluff cycle. "
"Frasier: Oh, well keep up the good work "
"Frasier: Hello? Yes. Well, hi Niles. Well, of course you can come by Great I'll, I'll see you there "
"it: it is "
"Frasier: Hi Niles, good to see you "
"Frasier: Thanks for calling first. "
"Niles: Well, I heard your show today. I wouldn't dream of popping by unannounced. "
"Frasier: Ah... "
"Niles: Actually, I was in the neighborhood, and I've come to beg a favor. Er, my housekeeper Mary is a very big fan of your little radio program. "
"Frasier: Is she? "
"Niles: Yes. Well, what she lacks in taste, she makes up for in vigor. She'd like an autographed photo. "
"Frasier: Oh well, it'd be my pleasure. Daphne, this is my brother Niles. "
"Niles: Hmm... you're Daphne? "
"Daphne: Why, yes I am. "
"Niles: Well, I... "
"Niles: When Frasier told me he'd hired an Englishwoman, I pictured someone a little more... not quite so... you're Daphne? "
"Daphne: It's nice to meet you. "
"Niles: Well, what a lovely accent. Is that, er, Manchester? "
"Daphne: Yes. How’d you know? "
"Niles: Oh, ha I'm quite the anglophile; I'm sure Frasier and dad have already told you. "
"Daphne: No, they didn't mention it. "
"Niles: Ah... you undoubtedly guessed as much when they said I'd spent a year studying at Cambridge. "
"Daphne: No, they didn't mention that, either. "
"Niles: I guess my father and brother don't spend a lot of time talking about me when I'm not around [starts to feel the knickers] "
"Daphne: Oh, I wouldn't say that... "
"Frasier: Niles, here's your picture... "
"Frasier: DO YOU MIND? "
"Niles: “Mary, here's wishing you good mental "
"health: Frasier Crane.” "
"Martin: Fits like a glove. Hi, Niles "
"Niles: Hey, dad... Wow. "
"Martin: How do I look? "
"Niles: Wow. "
"Daphne: Dr. Crane took your father shopping to Armani this afternoon. "
"Niles: You got that at Armani? "
"Martin: Just like I told you, Frasier - he can't tell the difference "
"Frasier: Well, we were on our way to Armani, when dad spotted this in the window of a discount clothing store. "
"Martin: It's sharkskin Look at the way it changes color when I move my arm "
"Daphne: You're going to be the handsomest gent at your friend's retirement party. Now come on, let's go and hang it up before it gets wrinkled. "
"Martin: Oh, it's supposed to resist wrinkles. They had one in the display window winded up inside a mayonnaise jar "
"Niles: Frasier, is he our real father? "
"Frasier: Now don't start that again - we've been having this discussion since we were children. "
"Niles: But that suit "
"Frasier: Well it's not just the suit, it's, it's his taste in everything Clothing, films, music... "
"Niles: Outside of our last name and abnormally well-developed calf muscles, we have nothing in common with the man. "
"Frasier: Well, thank goodness we took after mum. "
"Niles: So how come he didn't acquire any of her... sophistication? "
"Frasier: Well, maybe he was too busy working his tail off so that we could have the nicer things. "
"Niles: Mmm. "
"Frasier: You know Niles, maybe it's time we tried to pay him back in some way. Expose him to some of the finer things, so that he'd stop lumbering through life like some great polyester dinosaur. "
"Niles: I don't know. Dad's so set in his ways. "
"Frasier: Well, we all are at some point in our lives. Remember when you used to think the 1812 Overture was a great piece of classical music? "
"Niles: Was I ever that young? "
"Frasier: Well, you and I have to broaden dad's horizons. Show him the world that he's only read about in TV Guide. "
"Niles: How about an evening of fine dining? "
"Frasier: Perfect... but where? "
"Niles: Le Cigare Volant "
"Frasier: Hah "
"Niles: But can we really get in? I've been trying for months. "
"Frasier: Oh, puh-leeze. Niles, you're forgetting the cache my name carries in this town. "
"Niles: Actually, I'm not. If the maitre d' happens to be a housewife, we're in. "
"Frasier: Niles, you are so mean. "
"Frasier: I'll just call information. "
"Niles: Oh, no need; I have it on speed dial. "
"Frasier: Oh. Thank you. Hello, this is Dr Frasier Crane. Yes, the one on the radio. [looks at Niles, triumphantly] Say... any chance of, er, getting a table for four on Saturday at er, say... eight, hmm? Merci, a bientôt We're in "
"Martin: Niles, can I get you a beer? Some pork rinds? "
"Niles: No thanks. Em... "
"Frasier: Dad, Niles and I and Maris would like you to join us for dinner on Saturday night at, Le Cigare Volante - it's one of the hottest new restaurants in town. "
"Martin: Ah, gee, I don't know, I... "
"Niles: Oh, oh-oh-oh, the food is to die for "
"Martin: Niles, your country and your family are to die for; food is to eat. Look, I appreciate the offer, but I wouldn't like it. "
"Frasier: Oh dad, how do you know if you don't try it? "
"Martin: Well, I didn't have to get shot in the hip with a .38 to know I wouldn't like that. "
"Frasier: Yes, but, dad, it'll give us a chance to have an evening all together as a family. You know, Niles and I really want to do this for you. "
"Martin: Oh... alright. "
"Frasier: We're gonna have the best time "
"Martin: Hey - it'll give me a chance to wear my new suit again, too "
"Frasier: And won't that be nice? "
"Three: KACL; Roz's booth, before show time. "
"Frasier: So, how do the calls look today? "
"Roz: Well, we've got a couple of jilted lovers, a man who's afraid of his car, a manic depressive, and three people who feel their lives are going nowhere. "
"Frasier: Oh, I love a Monday. So how was your weekend? "
"Roz: I had the most hellacious date of my life. First, he asks me to pick him up from work. Then, I stop for gas - I have to pump it myself while he just sits there reading the sports section. So I take him back to my place and make him my famous sweet and sour shrimp; I'm in the middle of cooking, I ask him to hand me the honey, and he gets this freaked-out look on his face and says he can't because he has a deathly fear of touching anything sticky. "
"Roz: I told him it was a new jar, but he didn't want to take any risks. "
"Frasier: Roz, where do you meet these people? "
"Roz: You got thirty seconds - you'd better get in there. "
"Frasier: Not yet. "
"Roz: Oh, no... "
"Frasier: Roz, are you ready? "
"Roz: Don't make me do this... "
"Frasier: Come on, we do this every Monday "
"Roz: You do this every Monday. I play along "
"Frasier: Come on "
"Frasier: Who's got the best talk show in Seattle? "
"Roz: We do. We do. "
"Frasier: Alright "
"Four: Frasier's apartment. "
"Daphne: We-ell Aren't you a bobby dazzler? "
"Frasier: Well, I'll go out on a limb and take that as a compliment. "
"Frasier: Where are you off to? "
"Daphne: I'm going to poker night. "
"Frasier: I wouldn't have pegged you as a card player. "
"Daphne: It's mostly social. Me and the girls just bumping the gums. No-one ever loses more than five or six hundred dollars. "
"Frasier: Hi, Niles "
"Niles: Hello. "
"Frasier: Where's Maris? Are you two taking separate elevators again? "
"Niles: Oh, no. I'm afraid Maris is having one of her episodes. "
"Frasier: Ah... "
"Niles: In the middle of dressing for the evening, she suddenly slumped down on the edge of the bed in her half-slip and sighed. Course, I knew then and there that dinner was not to be. "
"Frasier: I'm sorry. "
"Niles: Yes, well, I'll just have to make the best of it... [strides over to Daphne] Hi-ho, Daphne, you're looking luminous this evening "
"Daphne: Why thank you, Dr. Crane. "
"Frasier: What's in the bag? "
"Niles: Er, just a little treat I picked up for "
"dad: some Devonshire Clotted Cream. "
"Frasier: For... dad? "
"Daphne: I love Devonshire Clotted Cream. "
"Niles: Isn't that lucky - you two can share it. "
"Daphne: I'll just go and pop this in the fridge. "
"Frasier: Sherry, Niles? "
"Niles: Thank you. "
"Niles: I'm having a thought, Frasier. Since Maris has sadly dropped out and we do have an extra space, perhaps we should invite Daphne to join us for the evening. I mean, it is a table for four and, and three is such an awkward number, you know, at a, at a dinner. "
"Frasier: What are you doing? "
"Niles: Nothing, nothing... Oh, for goodness sake, Frasier I'm a happily married man Maris means the world to me. Why, just the other day I kissed her for no reason whatsoever. "
"Daphne: Well, I'm off to my poker game. It was nice seeing you again, Dr. Crane... "
"Daphne: Oh, wait a minute I'm getting something on you... "
"Frasier: She's psychic. We've decided to find it charming. "
"Daphne: You have occasional bouts of colitis, don't you? "
"Niles: Yes "
"Niles: Frasier...she's phenomenal "
"Daphne: It's a gift. Well, cheerio "
"Niles: Ta-ta "
"Frasier: Niles, you've never had colitis a day in your life "
"Niles: I know, but I couldn't bear to disappoint her... "
"Martin: 'Kay I'm ready to go "
"Frasier: Ah, ah, dad, what's happened to your suit? "
"Martin: Oh, it's at the cleaners. I got some creamed chicken on it at Phil's retirement dinner last night. You can't keep anything nice. "
"Niles: Well, well, I-I-I-I'm sure the Cigare Volante has a dress code... "
"Frasier: Er Niles, may I borrow your phone? "
"Frasier: Thank you so much. "
"Martin: Where's Maris? "
"Niles: Episode. "
"Martin: Oh. "
"Frasier: Yes hello, this is Dr Frasier Crane; I have a reservation tonight. I'm calling to enquire about your, minimum dress code. Crane. Frasier. Doctor Well, what do you... we've had the reservation for over a week They've lost our reservation. "
"Niles: Give me that. Listen, this is Dr. Niles Crane. I've never been treated so shabbily in my entire life and I've a good mind to come over there and create an embarrassing scene. "
"Frasier: Niles, they've already hung up. "
"Niles: Ah... thank God Well, what now, Frasier? It's Saturday night, quarter-to-eight, and we-we're not going to get in anywhere. "
"Martin: Hey, I know Why don't I take us all to The Timber Mill? "
"Niles: The... Timber Mill? "
"Martin: Oh, it's great You can get a steak this thick for eight- ninety-five "
"Niles: Ah... honestly, dad, that doesn't sound like the kind of restaurant we'd like. "
"Martin: Well, I was willing to go to your place. "
"Frasier: Er, dad, I I think we'd better just er, take a rain check. "
"Martin: Oh gee, I was looking forward to spending an evening with you boys. But we can do it some other time. I'm sure Daphne's got something in the fridge I can heat up... "
"Frasier: You know, on second thoughts I'm, I'm really in the mood for a good steak "
"Niles: What? "
"Frasier: Well yes, you know, the point of the whole thing is not exactly where we have dinner, but that the three of us have an evening together as a family Right? "
"Martin: Ah, you won't be sorry They've got five different toppings for your baked potato "
"Frasier: Ooh, did you hear that, Niles? "
"Niles: I'm sold "
"Martin: We'll bring you a bone, Eddie "
"Martin: He's ecstatic. "
"One: The Timber Mill. "
"Martin: Quite a place, huh? Used to be a real working saw-mill "
"Frasier: Until somebody stated the obvious and "
"said: “Hey, let's turn this place into a restaurant” "
"Martin: I just walk in here and my mouth starts watering. There's nothing like the smell of charbroiled meat. "
"Niles: This aroma's triggering a, a sense memory. Something familiar. It... oh, of course, Maris in her home tanning bed. "
"Hostess: Hi Welcome to The Timber Mill. "
"Frasier: You don't have a table for three... do you? "
"Hostess: Sure, right this way. "
"Hostess: Is this your first visit to The Timber Mill? "
"Frasier: Yes. "
"Hostess: Well, we've got a dress code. "
"Frasier: Oh well, couldn't you make an exception in this case? His suit was at the cleaners- "
"Hostess: Er, not him. You. "
"Hostess: Tim-berrr "
"Frasier: My tie She, she cut off my tie "
"Martin: Gotcha Ain't that great? "
"Frasier: Well, why did she cut off my tie? "
"Martin: Oh, they've been doing it for years They like to keep the place casual. "
"Niles: Dad, you could have mentioned that to us. "
"Martin: What, and spoil the fun? Ah, cheer up You get a free dessert "
"Frasier: Oh, boy. Well, I guess you're right, dad; it's just a tie... "
"Niles: A Hugo Boss tie. "
"down: Frasier on the left, Niles on the right, and Martin "
"Waitress: Hi, can I get you guys something from the bar? "
"Frasier: Oh dear God, yes. "
"Niles: I'll have a Stoli Gibson on the rocks, with three pearl onions. "
"Frasier: If you bring him two, if you bring him four - he'll send it back. "
"Waitress: And for you? "
"Frasier: The same. "
"Martin: I'll have a Ballantine. "
"Niles: Say, funny thing happened the other "
"day: one of my patients had a rather amusing Freudian slip. He was having dinner with his wife, and he meant to say, “pass the salt,” but instead he said, “You've ruined my life, you blood-sucking shrew.” "
"Martin: Bet she didn't like that. "
"Niles: N-no, no dad, she didn't. Say, how was your buddy's retirement party last night? "
"Martin: Oh, it was great. You know, I really miss those guys. Bad news, though. Remember Mo Hanson? The desk captain of my old precinct? Killed in a boating accident. "
"Niles: Oh, I'm sorry. "
"Martin: Yeah. Well, at least he went quick. Hank Grinsky - well, he had three bypasses before he went. "
"Martin: Jimmy Bourbon, he had this weird disease. I went to visit him in the hospital; by the time he died, his skin was all yellow, wasted away to nothing. Nice nurse, though – Betty, I think her name was. "
"Waitress: I see we have a couple of first-timers here Let me tell you how it works. Every entrée comes with soup or a trip to the salad "
"bar: one trip only, please Also included is our famous garlic cheese bread. "
"Waitress: And now if you're ready, you can claim your steaks. "
"Niles: Claim our steaks...? "
"Martin: You get to pick the cut you want off the beef trolley "
"Frasier: How much extra would I have to pay to get one from the refrigerator? "
"Martin: Would you just pick your steak? "
"Niles: I'll, I'd like a, a petite filet mignon, very lean - not so lean that it lacks flavour, but not so fat that it leaves drippings on the plate. And I don't want it cooked - just lightly seared on either side, pink in the middle; not a true pink, but not a mauve either, something in between. Bearing in mind the slightest error either way, and it's ruined. "
"Waitress: ...Okay How about you? "
"Frasier: Could I see the other side of that one? [points queasily at a steak] "
"Martin: Just bring us those "
"three: medium-rare, all the 'fixins. "
"Martin: Hey, come on There's a lull at the salad bar "
"Two: The Timber Mill, later. "
"Martin: Isn't this great? They have the best Thousand Island Dressing in town. "
"Frasier: I know, dad, I saw the plaque by the cash register. "
"courses: steaks, baked potatoes "
"Waitress: Here we "
"go: three boiled onions, medium-rare "
"Frasier: Wha-? We've barely touched our salads "
"Martin: Great service, huh? "
"Niles: Yes. With any luck we should be completing our dining experience in less than twenty minutes. "
"Waitress: If you're not ready I could put this under the heat lamp... "
"Frasier: Oh no, no-no, that won't be necessary young lady, I'm as ready as I'll ever be... "
"Waitress: Alright. Let me know if I can get you anything else. "
"Frasier: Yes, thank you. "
"Martin: You know, I don't mind you guys being tough on this place, but you could be a little nicer to the waitress. "
"Frasier: You're right. I'll apologize when she comes with the dessert. Which should be any time now. "
"Martin: Sometimes there's nothing like a good steak. "
"Frasier: I wish this was one of those times. "
"Martin: What's wrong? "
"Frasier: Well, I don't mean to complain, but... "
"Martin: Well, then don't For your information, these steaks come from prized beef raised at... What the hell are you doing? "
"Niles: Something seems to have fallen in my potato. "
"Martin: Those are bacon bits "
"Niles: But I didn't ask for them. "
"Martin: I ordered all the 'fixins. You got all the 'fixins. "
"Niles: But I don't eat bacon because of the nitrates. "
"Martin: No problem. They're artificial. They're made out of soy. "
"Frasier: They really look out for your health here, don't they? "
"Martin: Everybody in this restaurant's enjoying the dinner. Can't you guys do the same? "
"Frasier: Niles... "
"Niles: Mmm-hmm? "
"Frasier: Is Maris organizing the... Arts Council benefit again, this year? "
"Niles: Matter of fact, she is. "
"Frasier: Where are they holding it? "
"Niles: Well, they haven't picked a spot yet... perhaps I should tell them about this place "
"Niles: I'd like to be a fly on the wall that night "
"Frasier: You wouldn't be the only one "
"Martin: Alright, that's it. I've had enough of you two jack-asses. I've spent the whole night listening to you making cracks about the food and the help. Well, I got news for "
"you: people like this place. I like this place. And when you insult this restaurant, you insult me. You know, I used to think you two took after your mother, liking the ballet and all that, but your mother liked a good ball game too. She even had a hot dog once in a while. [reaches into his pocket] She may have had fancy tastes, but she had too much class to ever make me or anybody else feel second-rate. If she saw the way you two have behaved tonight, she'd be ashamed. I know I am. "
"Frasier: Dad, wait "
"Martin: No, I'm going over to Duke's for a night-cap. "
"Frasier: Well, at least let us take you there "
"Martin: I'll take the cab I've had enough of you two for one night. Leave the waitress a good tip. She deserves it. "
"Frasier: Niles, say something "
"Niles: Dad, wait... "
"Niles: ...the Mud Pie's coming "
"Frasier: “The Mud Pie's coming” I feel terrible. "
"Niles: Oh, so do I... "
"Frasier: You know, the sad thing is, he's right about us. "
"Niles: Have we really become such snobs? "
"Frasier: You don't see anybody else driving their father out into the street to drink, do you? "
"Frasier: Niles, we... we've gotta apologize to dad. "
"Niles: You're right. "
"Frasier: We'll give him a couple of hours to cool down over at Duke's, and then when he gets home, we'll, we'll settle this thing. "
"Niles: Absolutely. We've been just horrid. Frasier... do you think we've actually lost the ability to appreciate the simple things? Steak, potatoes... ‘fixins? "
"Frasier: I'm afraid so. Well you know, the thing is, this-this is, this is good food I mean, it's not too fancy but it's, it's, it's good, wholesome American fare "
"Niles: You know Frasier, as a tribute to dad, I think we should sit here until we have cleaned our plates. "
"Frasier: Well, I'm game if you are "
"Frasier: Going to prove that we are not snobs. "
"Niles: Absolutely. "
"Niles: Frasier... "
"Frasier: Hmm? "
"Niles: Look who's here. "
"Frasier: Eat your meal "

"Frasier: Dad, he's doing it again Must this dog stare at me all the time? "
"Martin: I don't know. Eddie - must ya? Apparently he must. "
"Frasier: What is so fascinating about me? What is it? Do you imagine I am a large piece of kibble? Am I some sort of canine enigma? Think about it, get back to me. "
"Daphne: Here we are, gents, dinner's up. Can I give you a hand clearing up your papers? "
"Martin: No, you better let me. I need to keep these in a particular order. "
"Daphne: What is all this, anyway? "
"Martin: Oh, it's an old case of mine from the police force - the “Weeping Lotus' murder. "
"Frasier: Dad, I can't believe you're still trotting this old thing up. He's been trying to solve this case for twenty years. "
"Martin: Yeah, and I'm not stopping until I do solve it. You adopt certain instincts when you're a cop. And my instinct tells me that this case can be cracked. There just must be one small thing I keep overlooking. "
"Frasier: There is - who the murderer was. "
"Daphne: It's nice you feel so dedicated. "
"Martin: It's a hobby. Some guys build a boat in their garage, I try to figure out why a maniac would kill a hooker and try to stuff her entire body into a bowling bag. It's relaxing "
"Frasier: Hello, Niles. "
"Niles: Sorry I'm late, Frasier. Just as we were leaving, Maris had a run-in with a rude directory assistance operator and it shattered her calm. "
"Frasier: Have you ever considered that maybe Maris is a bit high strung? Maybe she should see someone. "
"Niles: She's seen everyone, why do you think she was calling directory assistance? "
"Daphne: Evening, Dr. Crane. "
"Niles: Hello, Daphne. It's so good to see you again. [she puts the meal down] What an enchanting scent you're wearing. "
"Daphne: Must be the ranch dressing. Won't Mrs. Crane be coming? "
"Niles: No, I'm afraid. And please, no more of this “Doctor” and “Mrs. Crane” formality. To you, it's Niles and... er... "
"Frasier: Maris. "
"Niles: Yes, Maris. "
"Martin: Glad you could join us, Niles. "
"Niles: Oh, I wouldn't have missed it. "
"Martin: Well, I guess the food's all "
"ready: why don't we just go ahead and start? "
"Daphne: Well, enjoy. "
"Martin: Where are you going? "
"Daphne: I thought I'd have mine in the kitchen. "
"Martin: Don't be ridiculous. "
"Niles: Yes, we can't have you eating by yourself in the kitchen. I'll join you. "
"Martin: No. We're all eating right here, like a family, end of discussion. "
"Daphne: Well, isn't this nice? Feels just like home. "
"Niles: I'm famished. "
"Frasier: Me, too. "
"Martin: You boys still say a prayer before you eat? "
"Martin: We thank you, Lord, for the food we're about to eat. You have blessed our table with your palm. And thank you, Lord, for bringing this family together and we also thank you for the other gifts you have given to us. And may we always be able to share with those less fortunate... "
"Frasier: OH, WILL YOU STOP STARING "
"Niles: I wasn't staring "
"Martin: Amen. "
"Niles: So Frasier, did you happen to read Derek Mann's column today? You were mentioned. "
"Frasier: No, I missed it. "
"Niles: Just as well, it wasn't flattering. "
"Frasier: I still would have liked to have seen it anyway. "
"Niles: Oh, why didn't you say so? "
"Daphne: If I may ask, who's Derek Mann? "
"Martin: He writes that 'Mann About Town' column for the Times. The things that guys comes out with, sometimes he's really funny - what did he say about you? "
"Frasier: “I hate Frasier Crane.” "
"Martin: Oh, sorry. "
"Frasier: That's it. 'I hate Frasier Crane.' That's it? "
"Martin: Oh, don't let it bother you. "
"Frasier: Well, actually it doesn't, dad. I knew when I chose a career in the public eye that I'd be open to certain criticisms, it's the price I pay for my celebrity. Thank you, Niles, for bringing me the paper, and thank you for highlighting it in yellow Now, who would like some wine? "
"Daphne: Oh, I'll have some. "
"Niles: Daphne, this salad is exquisite. "
"Frasier: Now why would he say that? "
"Martin: Must be the carrots, he always did like them. "
"Frasier: Not the salad, Derek Mann. I mean, why would he write a thing like that? I've never done anything to him, the attack is totally unwarranted. I'm a healer, for God's sake. "
"Martin: Oh, for crying out loud "
"Frasier: Dad, I have every right to feel upset about this - I will not enjoy my dinner until this is where it belongs - in the trash. "
"Niles: Oh, oh, there was an article in there I wanted to save. "
"Martin: On what? "
"Niles: Nothing. "
"Martin: Come on, I'm interested. "
"Niles: Oh, let's drop it. "
"Martin: Why can't you tell me? "
"Niles: All right, it was all about Margaret Thatcher's secret for growing prize-winning zinnias. Are you happy? "
"Martin: Not really. "
"Frasier: All right, Lorraine. Now, calm down and try and listen to what I'm going to say to you. Will you do that? "
"Lorraine: Okay. "
"Frasier: All right, good girl. Now your problem... "
"Lorraine: Oh my gosh, another call waiting - someone else is trying to get through. Do you mind if I take it? "
"Frasier: No, no. Go right ahead. Well, certainly a very interesting situation she's got herself into. Don't you think so, Roz? "
"simple: "
"Roz: Yes. "
"Lorraine: Okay, I'm back. "
"Frasier: All right, Lorraine. Now listen very carefully to what I'm going to tell you. Your problem seems... "
"Lorraine: Oh, I'm sorry, I'll be right back. "
"Frasier: For someone who's got so many problems she certainly is popular. "
"Lorraine: Okay, go ahead Dr. Crane. I'm here. Oh, I don't believe it - another call. "
"Frasier: Hold it there, Lorraine. The reason why you want to take that other call is the same reason that you want to change your career and break up with your boyfriend. You're obsessed with what you think you're missing. The better offer, the call on the other line. Well, you've got to take one call at a time from now on. Fully explore and experience each one in its turn and you'll be a stronger person for it. Do you follow me, Lorraine? "
"Lorraine: Okay, I'm back "
"Frasier: Thank you for your call. Well, we've only got two minutes left, so I would like to end today's program on a personal note. As some of you may know, yesterday I was mentioned in Derek Mann's 'Mann About Town' column. He said, and I quote, 'I Hate Frasier Crane'... 'I Hate Frasier Crane'. What trenchant criticism. Move aside Voltaire, step back in the shadows H.L. Mencken, there's a new kid in town. One can only wonder how many hours Derek Mann sat in the glow of his computer screen before his trembling fingers sprang to life and pecked out this chef t'"
"ouerve: 'I Hate Frasier Crane.' A lesser critic would have wasted our time by presenting a well thought-out, point by point, constructive critique of this show. No, not our Mr. Mann. So dear listeners, when Mr. Mann's column arrives on your front doorstep - read it, enjoy it, but above all, treasure it. For one day this man will be joining the Pantheon of the immortals. And if we're lucky... it'll be one day soon. I'm Dr. Frasier Crane. "
"TO: "
"Niles: Frasier, how funny running into you here. "
"Frasier: I'm always here. "
"Niles: Yes well, you weren't here twenty minutes "
"ago: have you seen today's 'Times'? "
"Frasier: No. "
"Niles: Lucky for you I saved you this copy. Take a look at Derek Mann's column. "
"Frasier: You know, this is the second time in as many days that you have given me a paper. Have you ever considered getting yourself a route? "
"Niles: Hello, I don't believe we've met. "
"Roz: Yes we have, Niles, three or four times. Roz Doyle. "
"Niles: Oh, of course. It was at the... it was during the... well, I'm far too successful to feel awkward. Where did we meet? "
"Roz: The radio station. "
"Niles: Ah, I'll take your word for it. Nice to see you again. [then, to "
"Frasier:] Mr. Mann heard your program yesterday. "
"Frasier: So I see. “Yesterday afternoon, Dr. Frasier Crane got on my case for not giving him a point by point criticism of his radio show. Well, he asked for it, so here goes.” "
"Roz: Oh my god, his entire column is about your show. "
"Niles: Not very flattering either. Towards the end he even attacks your 'dimwitted sidekick call screener.' "
"Roz: That's me "
"Niles: Oh, now I remember you "
"Frasier: “It's hard to say what I hate most about Crane's show – his pompous, sanctimonious style, his constant self- congratulatory references to his own life, or his "
"voice: a mock- sympathetic tone so sickly sweet one wonders if the man graduated from medical school or from some mind-controlling cult.” "
"Niles: It's continued on twelve. "
"Frasier: I've read enough "
"Waiter: Can I get you something? "
"Frasier: How can the man think something like that? "
"Waiter: It's my job, I'm a waiter. "
"Frasier: We don't want anything, thank you. "
"Roz: Frasier, I know this stinks, but in a couple of days it'll blow over. "
"Frasier: Oh, perhaps you're right. As angry as it makes me, to retaliate would be to stoop to his level. So the best response is no response at all. "
"TO: "
"Frasier: “Pompous and sanctimonious,” am I? Well, this Mann character can't even write grammatical sentences Every five words there's one of his precious 'dot, dot, dots.' Must be because he likes writing all those dots with the crayon he writes this drivel in "
"Roz: Dr. Crane, on line two we have Stewart who's having a problem with delayed gratification. "
"Frasier: Well, he's just going to have to wait I don't know who this Derek Mann thinks he is, but if he thinks he can hide behind his newspaper like some sniveling schoolchild cowering behind a tree, then I say let's expose this Derek Mann for what he "
"is: not a man at all, but half a man Now what line did you say Stewart was on? "
"Roz: He hung up. "
"Frasier: Well, I'm leaving all sorts of bodies in my wake today. Let's see who's on line five. Hello, this is Dr. Frasier Crane - I'm listening. "
"Derek: Good, because I was listening too. "
"Frasier: And you are? "
"Derek: Derek Mann. "
"Frasier: I see. "
"Derek: Look, nobody calls me half a man - especially some Ivy League twit. So what do you say we settle this like men? "
"Frasier: Are you implying that you want to fight me? "
"Derek: I'm not implying, I'm saying. "
"Frasier: Fight, as in a fist fight? "
"Derek: No, I thought we might throw pies at each other So are you up to it, or aren't you man enough? "
"Frasier: We'll be right back after these messages. "
"Time: 11"
":05) "
"Frasier: And we're back. Well, we have a surprise caller on the "
"line: Derek Mann. "
"Derek: So what's it going to be, Crane, are you going to fight me or not? "
"Frasier: Oh, you can't be serious. "
"Derek: Just like I figured, you're chicken. "
"Frasier: No, I just don't think that civilized people behave that way. You know, Roz, perhaps our listeners have an opinion about that subject? Who do we have on the line? "
"Roz: Well, lines one through eight are people who think you're chicken. "
"Derek: You're chicken, Crane. Admit it "
"Frasier: I am not chicken "
"Derek: "
"Frasier: We are mature thinking people, not cavemen "
"Derek: "
"Frasier: Alright, if you want a fight so bad, I'll give you a fight You just say the time and place "
"Derek: Kinsley square, right outside your office, by the old statue. Noon tomorrow. Don't back out "
"Frasier: I won't Don't you back out either because I know where your office is too, and I know where you live, and I'll track you down Now who else out there wants a piece of me? "
"TO: "
"Daphne: Having a look at that old murder case again? "
"Martin: Yeah, I've dug out the old crime scene photos. "
"Daphne: Well, don't be a greedy guts - let me have a look. "
"Daphne: Her name was Helen. "
"Martin: Yeah, it was. Ah, you must have seen it on some of my papers I've had lying around here. "
"Daphne: No, I just got this feeling when I touched the picture. "
"Martin: You're putting me on. "
"Daphne: She had a lot of men in her life. "
"Martin: No "
"kidding: she was a hooker "
"Daphne: No, I mean she had four brothers. "
"Martin: That's amazing. She did have four brothers. What else are you getting? Well, come on, tell me more. "
"Daphne: I can't just turn it on and off like a faucet. "
"Martin: Give it a try, will you? Please. What else are you getting? "
"Daphne: Nothing. No, wait. I see a man. "
"Martin: Yeah? "
"Daphne: A well-dressed man. He's wearing wing tips and a trench coat. "
"Martin: Yeah? Yeah? "
"Daphne: He's getting off an elevator... he's walking down a long hallway... she doesn't know he's coming... he's opening the door... "
"Frasier: Hello, everyone. "
"Daphne: Sometimes I get my signals crossed. "
"Frasier: What's going on? "
"Martin: Well - unless you killed a hooker when you were twelve - nothing much "
"Daphne: We heard your show today. I just loved the way you handled that Derek Mann. "
"Martin: You made your old man proud. Yet the best part was when he challenged you to a fight and you stood right up to him. "
"Frasier: Yes I did, didn't I? "
"Martin: I can't wait to see that. "
"Frasier: Oh, I'm not actually going to go through with it, dad. "
"Martin: What are you talking about? "
"Frasier: Well, I already won our little war of words. What would I stand to benefit by going through with actually going through with a fist fight? "
"Martin: Frasier, maybe I'm misunderstanding here... he challenged you and you're backing down? "
"Frasier: Well, mature people are supposed to use their intellect to settle their differences. "
"Martin: A man doesn't just turn his tail and run - that's not the way I brought you up. "
"Frasier: Are you encouraging me to fight? "
"Martin: You bet I am - you gave the guy your word. "
"Frasier: Yes, but I didn't even know what I was saying - I hadn't even had lunch yet. "
"Martin: I might have known this would have happened. It's Billy Kreizel all over again. "
"Frasier: What did you say? "
"Martin: Something about a Billy Kreizel, I believe. "
"Frasier: I can't believe you're dragging that up - that was thirty years ago. "
"Daphne: Who's this Billy Kreizel? "
"Frasier: Oh, he was this kid in fifth grade that used to torment me "
"Martin: So one day Frasier made fun of Billy's crewcut. "
"Frasier: Well, he started it by making fun of the elbow patches on my blazer "
"Martin: Well, the point is, they were supposed to meet for a fight after school. Only 'Patches' here didn't show up "
"Frasier: I had a clarinet lesson "
"Martin: You don't need to remind me of that Billy's old man was a cop, too. Boy, the guys rode me about that excuse of yours for years. Every time I couldn't make it out for a drink they used to say, 'What's the matter? You got a clarinet lesson?' "
"Daphne: Couldn't you and Billy have met after the clarinet lesson? "
"Frasier: Daphne, would you please excuse us for a moment "
"Daphne: I have a feeling I'm going to be excused quite a lot in this house. "
"Frasier: Dad, I am sorry if I embarrassed you for not fighting Billy Kreizel thirty years ago. But the situation is not the same now. "
"Martin: It's exactly the same. "
"Frasier: I am an adult now, I've been to medical school, I hold a certain position in this city - I do not settle my differences with brawling. "
"Martin: The man challenged you and you accepted. "
"Frasier: Dad, I can't believe this. You won't be happy until I come home with a black eye. "
"Martin: I just want you to do what you said you were going to do. You know, you can talk about your medical school, your intellect, your place in this city, but you know what? It's all one big clarinet lesson... I can't even look at you. "
"TO: "
"Roz: So, I step out of the shower, I look out of the window and I notice the garbage man looking right in at me. So I say, 'Did you get a good look?' And he says, 'Not completely, turn around.' Then he smiled, and he's missing a tooth, and that's when the romance went right out of it for me. "
"Frasier: Roz, why are you telling me this story? "
"Roz: I'm trying to take your mind of the fact that in five minutes you're going to walk right out into that square and get your clock cleaned. "
"Frasier: Well, has it ever occurred to you that I might actually win this fight? "
"Roz: Your shoe’s untied. If you fell for that one, you're going down and you're going down hard. "
"Niles: Frasier, there's quite a crowd forming out there. Secretaries with bag lunches, business men, children with balloons... "
"Frasier: All that's missing is a mariachi band. "
"Niles: They're setting up. "
"Roz: Well, I better go find a great place in the crowd. I'll be off to the left, Frasier, for when you tear his ear off and want to throw it to a beautiful senorita. "
"Niles: Frasier, as your brother and as your friend - why are you doing this? "
"Frasier: It's Billy Kreizel. "
"Niles: Where? "
"Frasier: He's not here, Niles. It's just that I ran away from him when I was ten. "
"Niles: I remember. "
"Frasier: You know, I've been running ever since. You know, this is where it stops. I'm not running anymore. "
"Niles: What is it that makes us Crane boys such targets? "
"Frasier: Chalk it up to random violence "
"Martin: Hey, there. "
"Frasier: Dad? What are you doing here? "
"Martin: Look son, I said a couple of things last night that maybe went over the line. "
"Frasier: Look dad, if you were worried that you talked me into something that I wasn't ready to do – well, you're wrong. You can relax. I took this on for myself. "
"Martin: Good. "
"Frasier: Who told you that I was going through with it, anyway? "
"Martin: Oh, let's just say a father knows certain things about his son. "
"Daphne: Good news, I parked in front of a broken meter. We're getting a freebie. Well, good luck, Dr. Crane, with the fight. "
"Frasier: Thank you, Daphne. Any psychic predictions on the outcome? "
"Daphne: Actually, yes. But don't worry, I'm frequently wrong. "
"Niles: Frasier, Frasier, there's something I want you to see. There, the man standing to the left of the statue - I recognize his picture from the newspaper, that's Derek Mann. "
"Frasier: He's gigantic "
"Daphne: My God, you could show a movie on his back "
"Martin: Are you sure you want to go through with this? "
"Frasier: Yes, yes I am. "
"Martin: Good, you'll be fine. Just remember this is a street fight and not a boxing match. So fight dirty and throw the first punch "
"Daphne: I found that a swift knee to the groin usually does the trick. If you have any doubts, check with a fellow in Manchester named Nigel Tavers. "
"Niles: Well, if we want an unobstructed view... "
"Frasier: Look, I prefer if you guys stay here. You'll only make me nervous. "
"Martin: Whatever you want. "
"Martin: They've got a mariachi band out there "
"Niles: I'll have to get their card, I need someone for our summer barbeque. "
"Daphne: Oh look, they’re starting the fight. "
"Martin: Nah, they’re just circling, sizing each other up. Come on, Frasier, if you're going to hit him, hit him now "
"Niles: Is that the police? "
"Martin: Yeah, what are they doing here? "
"Daphne: They're breaking it up Just when they were getting started. "
"Frasier: Alright, I'll come along peacefully - let me just get my jacket. "
"Officer: Relax, I'm not arresting you. But I'm warning you that in this town we don't settle our differences with street fights - no matter who you are. "
"Frasier: Well thank you, officer, you'll have no more trouble from me. "
"Officer: Okay. "
"Frasier: Dad, dad, did you see me? My hands are trembling, my chest is pounding, my mouth is all dry, my knees are like jello... God, I feel great "
"Martin: You did good. "
"Frasier: Yeah, I was out there. I was raring to go, you saw that... "
"Martin: I know you were. You would have kicked his butt "
"Daphne: From here to Tacoma. "
"Niles: I think we should celebrate Everyone, a round of victory lattes on me. "
"Martin: Thanks Harry, I owe you one. "
"Officer: No problem, Marty. "
"Martin: You cut it pretty close, though. Another minute, then Frasier would have been sidewalk litter. He would have been lunch meat. "
"Officer: Say, some of the guys are getting together later at Duke’s. Why don't you come along? "
"Martin: Yeah, maybe I will. And you know why I will? Because the Crane boys don't take clarinet lessons anymore. "
"Officer: What the hell are you talking about? "
"Martin: Oh that's right, you weren't in my precinct. "

"Frasier: Hello Doug, this is Dr. Frasier Crane. I'm listening. "
"Doug: Look, it's about my mother. She's getting on now and she doesn't have much of a life. And she doesn't want to do anything or go anywhere and she literally hangs around the house all day. I mean, it's very frustrating... "
"Frasier: I'm sorry Doug, can we just go back a second? You said your mother literally hangs around the house. Well, I suppose it's a pet peeve of mine but I suppose what you mean is that she figuratively “hangs around” the house. To literally hang around the house you'd have to be a bat or spider monkey. Now, back to your problem? "
"Doug: Do you mind if we stop while I tell you my pet peeve? "
"Frasier: Not at all. "
"Doug: I hate it when intellectual pinheads with superiority complexes nit-pick your grammar when they come to you for help. That's what I got a problem with [hangs up] "
"Frasier: I think what he means is, that is a thing with which he has a problem. Now it's time for a station break and we'll be right back after a word from our friends at 'Pizza, Pizza, Pizza.' "
"Roz: Hey, do you want to know my pet peeve? It's when you're in a department store and the clerk is right in the middle of helping you and the phone rings. So he starts taking care of them. And you're left standing there going, 'Excuse me, but all I did was come all the way down here in person, whilst some joker is sitting at home in his underwear getting first rate service' Don't you hate that? "
"Frasier: Actually, I do most of my shopping by phone. You know Roz, this conversation with Doug has got me thinking about my father. He doesn't do much of anything either. He just sits around most of the time watching TV and doing the occasional crossword puzzle. What does your mother do? "
"Roz: She's the attorney general of Wisconsin. "
"Frasier: No, really "
"Roz: Really "
"Frasier: I guess that helps fill her day. "
"Roz: Yeah, quote mom, 'Crime never stops - even in the dairy state' "
"Frasier: I don't think public office is for Dad, but maybe I could find him a hobby or something. Any suggestions? "
"Roz: Well, in her spare time my mom likes to water ski a little. She hikes, oil paints... oh, she likes archaeology. She's on a dig in Honduras right now. "
"Frasier: Well, maybe I could get him a wood burning set. "
"Frasier: Is Dad still asleep? "
"Daphne: Yes, he's napping with the dog. Eddie's little legs are going like mad. I think he's dreaming about chasing rabbits. I can't explain your father's twitching "
"Frasier: I think I'm just about done with this thing. "
"Daphne: I think your dad's going to love it. "
"Frasier: Me, too. I was walking through the hobby shop and saw this thing and it was like, 'Eureka' I actually said 'Eureka' Ah, yes. There are a million stories in the naked city. Now if we could just find a naked one. "
"Daphne: Dr. Crane, you naughty boy. Peeking in on other people's privacy. "
"Frasier: Daphne, really. I mean, if people were so concerned about their precious privacy they wouldn't leave their blinds open at that certain angle where you can see the mirror over the mantle that reflects down the hall to the water bed in the back room "
"Daphne: I think I hear your father coming. Stand in front of it, we'll make this a little surprise. "
"Martin: Hi, guys. "
"Frasier: Dad. "
"Daphne: How was your nap? "
"Martin: Great, I had the strangest dream. I dreamt this beautiful woman with bad breath was licking my face. "
"Martin: Hey, where did you just come from? "
"Frasier: Dad, I got a surprise for you. "
"Martin: Hey, it's a beaut. What's the occasion? "
"Frasier: Oh, no occasion, just thought you'd like it. "
"Martin: Wow, that's great, thanks. You know, I saw in the news there's a bunch of falcons nesting in the eaves of the Columbia Tower. Maybe I can watch them from here. "
"Frasier: Dad, Dad, forget the falcons. You can see everything that’s going on in that apartment building over there. "
"Martin: Hey, I've locked people up for that kind of behavior. "
"Frasier: Oh come on, it's perfectly innocent - just think of it as a hundred more channels to watch. "
"Daphne: Just look at them, people going about their lives. There's an old couple watching the telly, and just next door an attractive young woman is working at a computer, while below her a burly man is using a beach towel to soak up a large pool of blood... oh my God "
"Martin: What? "
"look: "
"Martin: No, that's tomato juice - you can see the can on the counter. You’re right about that woman at the computer though, she's a looker. "
"Frasier: Ah, you see, there's a voyeur in all of us. "
"Martin: Well, let's see what else the Seattle skyline has to offer. "
"Daphne: I say we make a strict rule, "
"though: if anybody starts doing anything nasty we move on. Agreed? I said, agreed? "
"Martin: Well, there's a lady over there with a telescope. She's looking right back at us. "
"Frasier: What shall we do? "
"Daphne: Hide "
"Frasier: I knew it, I knew it, every time we do something bad we get caught "
"Martin: Hi, how you doing? "
"Frasier: What are you doing? "
"Martin: She's waving at us, I'm waving back. "
"Frasier: Don't do that "
"Martin: Why not? Hey wait, she's writing something down. She's holding it up. It says, 'Hello there, stranger.' Hey Daphne, get me that pad and pen. "
"Frasier: What for? "
"Martin: So I can answer her. Write down 'My name is Martin.' "
"Frasier: Dad, Dad you shouldn't encourage this person. I don't really want people looking in on our lives. I don't think I've even made my bed today. "
"Daphne: Is she writing anything else? "
"Martin: Yeah. 'My name is Irene.' Her name's Irene. "
"Daphne: Her name's Irene. "
"Frasier: Thank you. "
"Martin: Wait, she's writing something else. “Is that Dr. Crane from the radio hiding in the back?” "
"Frasier: It does not say that It does say that. [he waves "
"back:] Hi "
"TO: "
"Martin: Her older son's an accountant in Portland. "
"Daphne: He was the breech birth, right? "
"Martin: No, that's Dennis in Boise. "
"Daphne: Oh right, he's the one with the wife that won't let him visit. I can't stand her. "
"Frasier: Morning Dad, Daphne. [waves to "
"window:] Morning, Irene. "
"Martin: Hey Frasier, when you were a kid, what was the name of that skin condition you had on your butt? "
"Frasier: Pityriasis Rosea. "
"Daphne: How do you spell that? "
"Frasier: Why? "
"Martin: Irene and I are exchanging family histories. "
"Frasier: I really don't think your girlfriend needs to know about that. "
"Martin: She's not my girlfriend "
"Frasier: Oh, come on. You two have been exchanging notes now for the past three days. If you were in the sixth grade you would be sitting in a tree 'K-I-S-S-I-N-G.' Here Daphne, let me borrow that pen. "
"Martin: What are you doing? "
"Frasier: I'm going to help along your little romance and possibly save a small forest. I'm giving her our telephone number. "
"Martin: No, no, no, no, no, don't do that "
"Frasier: Why? "
"Martin: Well, she'll think I'm being too forward. "
"Frasier: For God's sake, Dad, you met peeping into her apartment. "
"Martin: She's not going to call. "
"Frasier: You want to bet? "
"Martin: Yeah, five bucks. "
"Frasier: Okay. "
"Frasier: Well, are you going to answer? "
"Martin: You get it. "
"Frasier: Dad, it's for you "
"Frasier: Hello. No, no, this is Frasier. Hi. I'm fine. Well, it gets a little flaky when the weather's dry. [rubs butt] "
"Martin: Tell her I'm not home. "
"Frasier: Dad, she knows you're home - she's looking at you through the telescope. "
"Daphne: Come on, you're just a little nervous. "
"Martin: Hello? Hi. Yeah, it's nice hearing yours. Can you hold on a minute? [puts phone to his chest, then to Frasier and "
"Daphne:] Would you two get out of here? "
"to: Kitchen "
"Daphne: I'm getting a very good feeling about this. "
"Frasier: Really? You really think he's interested in her? "
"Daphne: Yes, I think so. "
"Daphne: Do you want to hear something cute, Dr. Crane? I made him this rich gooey coffee cake this morning, because you know what a sweet tooth he has. And he wouldn't take one bite because - as he put it - 'Women don't like a spare tire on a man.' "
"Frasier: That's so cute. Oh, it's funny, you know - the twists and turns of fate. If I had tried to set Dad up with a woman he would have rejected the idea out of hand - but I go out get him this telescope for a hobby and it kindles this romance. It's Kismet "
"until: "
"Frasier: Well? "
"Martin: What? "
"Daphne: What happened? "
"Martin: We talked on the phone. "
"Daphne: And? Was she nice, was she interesting? What did she say? "
"Martin: She said a lot of stuff. "
"Frasier: So it would be safe to assume that you two will be seeing each other? "
"Martin: Ah, she wanted to, but I said no. "
"Frasier: No? Why? "
"Martin: She's not my type. Oh, coffee cake We got any butter round here? "
"TO: "
"Niles: You know Brewster Cale? The pompous twit who is the president of our wine club? Well, at our meeting the other night I convinced some of my fellow psychiatrists to play a little prank on him. When he thought he was tasting the Chateau Petrus, he was in fact sipping a Forcas Dupres. You see, we’d switched the labels. "
"Frasier: What scamps you are "
"Niles: There he was, proclaiming the Petrus to be the superior wine and of course none of us could contain our laughter. "
"Frasier: His face must have turned redder than a 'Piechoné Logeavie.' "
"Niles: Well of course, as so often happens, rough house turns to tears. At the end of the evening, Brewster tended his resignation. "
"Frasier: That must have put a damper on the evening. "
"Niles: Well, not really. I'm the new president. "
"Frasier: Kudos indeed. "
"Niles: Oh, oh, oh, is our dad and his lady friend still playing telescope footsy? What was her name? "
"Frasier: Irene. No, they've broken it off. "
"Niles: Already? I thought it was going so well. "
"Frasier: Well it was, but then they spoke once and Dad said that she wasn't his type. So, it's over - done He's completely cut her out of his life. I just don't understand what would make him do that. "
"Niles: Oh, who knows why anybody does anything? "
"Frasier: Remind me again what you do for a living? You see the thing is, it was just one phone call. How can anyone make a sound judgment about another person on the basis of one phone call? "
"Niles: Remind me again what it is YOU do for a living? "
"Frasier: Well anyway, I suppose it could be any number of reasons. Fear of rejection, shyness... "
"Niles: Or maybe Dad was telling the truth and he just wasn't her type. If only we knew someone who was... I know Maris's lovely Aunt Patrice is in town visiting from Washington, D.C. Oh, oh, oh, maybe we should set Dad up with her. "
"Frasier: No, Niles, I've met Aunt Patrice. The woman is a loon. "
"Niles: Frasier, do this for me. Every time Aunt Patrice comes to visit, Maris makes all these plans, before she dives under the duvet with a two-week migraine and I'm left holding the bag – literally and figuratively. "
"Frasier: Oh, I don't think so, Niles. I know Dad, don't meddle. "
"Niles: Alright, the least you could do is say hello to Aunt Patrice. "
"Frasier: I'm not driving out to your house. "
"Niles: You don't have to. She's sitting out in the car. "
"Frasier: You left her in the car? "
"Niles: I cracked open a window. "
"Frasier: Well, then she's fine. "
"Time: 11"
":48) "
"Frasier: Now calm down son, listen to daddy. It's just a bad dream. I promise you, Senator Thurmond is not in your closet. That's a good boy. Yes, okay you go back to bed now. I love you too. Listen, I'll see you next weekend. Okay, bye bye. "
"Martin: How's Freddie? "
"Frasier: Oh, Frederick is fine. Oh, he sends his love. He said to thank you for the toy gun you gave him. At least what he can remember of it before Lilith smashed it to bits with a croquet mallet. "
"Daphne: Oh it's such a beautiful night. The city is lit up like a jewel. Oh look, there's Irene. She's sitting in her window wearing a stunning green dress. But her face, it's so sad. "
"Frasier: Oh, oh, she's holding a note. It says, 'Martin, was it something I wrote?' "
"Martin: Will you cut it out? Irene is not sitting in her window. "
"Frasier: Oh alright Dad, no she isn't, but she might as well be, for god’s sakes. That's gotta be what she's thinking "
"Martin: Haven't you ever met a woman and then decide she's not the one? "
"Frasier: Yes, five years after I married her. "
"Niles: Hello there, Frasier. "
"Frasier: Niles - I was specifically not expecting you. "
"Niles: Frasier, you remember Aunt Patrice. "
"Frasier: Well, of course. Aunt Patrice, yes. I don't recall really when we met but I believe there was a lot of laughing and dancing. "
"Patrice: My husband's funeral. "
"Frasier: Yes... well, of course, the laughter was to hide our tears. Let me take your wrap. "
"Patrice: Thank you. "
"Niles: We were taking a drive and I thought, 'Why, we are just a couple of short ferry rides from Frasier's,' so we decided to pop over. "
"Patrice: Niles, is this the charming gentleman you were telling me about? "
"Niles: Oh, Patrice, you bloodhound. You've treed another one Yes, this is my dad. "
"Martin: How do you do, Patrice, I'm Martin Crane. This is Daphne Moon. "
"Daphne: Nice to meet you. Please. "
"Patrice: Thank you. "
"Martin: So, what brings you to Seattle? "
"Patrice: Well, I came to see Maris, but the poor thing's taken to her bed again. To this day I have no idea how tall she is. "
"Niles: Yes, so I've had Patrice all to myself and we've had a great time, haven't we? "
"Patrice: Well, if you call sitting in your waiting room for four hours reading old magazines a great time, well then yes - we had a laugh riot. "
"Niles: Oh, now I know where Maris gets her sense of humor "
"Patrice: Oh. "
"Daphne: Why don't I pop into the kitchen and gets us all some refreshments? "
"Niles: A capital idea, and why don't Frasier and I join you? That'll give these kids some time to get to know one another. "
"to: Kitchen "
"Frasier: Niles, I distinctly told you not to bring her here. "
"Niles: I ran out of ways to entertain her. We went to the arboretum, a fashion show, a matinée of 'La Cage Aux Folles' and we even spat off the top of the Space Needle. I'm sorry, I cracked "
"Frasier: Niles, that woman is certainly not Dad's type. "
"Niles: You never know when love can bloom between two people who seem so different on the surface. Do you, Daphne? "
"Daphne: To tell you the truth, I never thought opposites attract. "
"Niles: Neither do I, we are alike in so many ways "
"Frasier: Oh come on, Niles. We can't leave Dad out there alone with her any longer. "
"to: Living Room "
"Niles: I'm sure they're doing just fine. "
"Patrice: D’goo y’goo sp’geak g-sp’geak? "
"Niles: Oh Lord, I was afraid of this. "
"Martin: What? "
"Patrice: D’goo y’goo sp’geak g-sp’geak? "
"Martin: Niles, I think she's having a stroke or something. "
"Niles: No, no Dad. It's just G-speak. "
"Martin: Come again? "
"Niles: It's something Maris and Aunt Patrice love to try out at parties. "
"Patrice: Yes, you just speak a “g” in every syllable. So you would be, 'M’garg-tin Cr’gane.' Just say it with me, come on... M’garg-tin... "
"Niles: I don't think Dad's interested. "
"Patrice: Oh, b’ge ag sp’gort, Gniles. "
"Frasier: What did she say? "
"Niles: She said, 'Be a sport, Niles.' "
"Patrice: B’ge, agus, gesport, geda "
"Frasier: Dad, do you still have your gun loaded? "
"Martin: It’s in my top drawer. "
"Patrice: Isn't it a hoot? Of course, it's all the rage in Washington. You know who speaks it all the time? G’George G’Step-gan-ogp-ogu-logs. "
"Daphne: I found some pizza rolls in the back of the freezer, but the expiration date was yesterday - are we game? "
"Frasier: Er, that won't be necessary, Daphne. We don't want to spoil our appetites for that dinner we're about to leave for in twenty minutes. "
"Martin: Yeah, that's right, that dinner in... er... twenty minutes. "
"Patrice: Oh Niles, I told you we shouldn't have just stopped by. These people have plans. "
"Niles: How I envy them. "
"Patrice: I enjoyed meeting you, Martin. "
"Martin: Likewise. "
"Patrice: Oh, now, now, you can do better than that. "
"Patrice: I'll look forward to my next trip to Seattle. Oh, and if you're ever in the Washington area - I'm in the b’gook. Bye-bye. "
"Martin: What the hell was that? "
"Daphne: I feel sorry for the poor thing. "
"Martin: I feel sorry for Niles. "
"Daphne: That's who I'm talking about. "
"Frasier: You know, I saw what you just did. "
"Martin: What did who do? "
"Frasier: When Patrice went to hug you, you moved away. "
"Martin: Well, wouldn't you? "
"Frasier: No, Dad, no. You moved away from the window. You didn't want Irene to see you with another woman. You still care about her. "
"Martin: Hey, go chase yourself. "
"Frasier: Dad, you do. There's something stopping you from having a relationship with this woman. Now, what is it? "
"Martin: You're not going to let go of this thing, are you? "
"Frasier: No, I'm not "
"Martin: Alright. Irene's middle name is Rose. "
"Frasier: So? Rose is a nice name. Rose was mother's middle name. Oh. "
"Martin: Yeah. "
"Frasier: Oh Dad, you can't feel guilty about that. Gee, mom's been gone for six years now. Your feelings for Irene are totally severed from your feelings for Mom. You know, if she was here, if she could tell you, she'd want you to get on with your life. "
"Martin: Okay, when I'm ready. Thanks, Frasier. You know - I guess I don't say it often enough but you're a good kid. "
"Frasier: Well, thanks Dad. You know, there's something I don't say often enough... "
"Martin: There's nothing you don't say often enough. "
"Frasier: Right, Dad. "
"to: Kitchen "
"Daphne: I couldn't help but overhear. That was a very nice thing to say. "
"Martin: Yeah, he's a good kid. "
"Daphne: The only strange part is - I could have sworn Irene's middle name was Marie. "
"Martin: No, it isn't. "
"Daphne: Well, I could go and check. I still have all our notes in the trash. "
"Martin: Alright, alright... well, I had to tell him something. Look, I don't know why he just won't believe me when I tell him that Irene just isn't my type. "
"Daphne: You sure she isn't? "
"Martin: You're going to get on my back too? "
"Daphne: No, but I was just wondering if the reason why things didn't work out between you and Irene was, well... "
"Martin: What? "
"Daphne: Well, maybe if you weren't just a little self-conscious about your hip? "
"Martin: That's ridiculous. "
"Daphne: Well, I'm glad to hear that, because you really don't have anything to be self-conscious about, you know. With that silvery mane, twinkling blue eyes and whiskey voice. You're quite a package. "
"Martin: Yeah, I'm quite a catch. "
"Daphne: You are. And you know as well as I do that history is full of sexy limpers. For instance, Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Of course he didn't limp so much as roll. Oh, I know, Toulouse Lautrec. Although he was rather a little person. Still, he did rather well with the ladies. Of course, they were all prostitutes. But then again, he was French and there's no explaining their taste. "
"Martin: What's your point? "
"Daphne: I guess I don't have one. It's just me running on the way I do. But there is one last little "
"thing: I did notice that every time you went to the telescope to see Irene - you hid your cane. "
"Martin: I just put it off to the side so I wouldn't trip over the damn thing. "
"Daphne: I knew there was a good reason. It must feel awful silly when that cane trips you up. "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Dad, Dad, will you hurry up? She's going to be here any minute. "
"Martin: Alright, alright, Daphne. See if I've got this tie on right? "
"Daphne: Just needs a minor adjustment. What's all this hair on it? "
"Martin: The only way I can get the knot right is if I tie it on Eddie first. "
"Martin: Well, it's a long time since I've been dating. Have things changed much in the last forty years? "
"Frasier: Well, the wardrobe’s a little different - but your ultimate goal is still the same Dad, I'm glad you changed your mind about this. "
"Martin: Yeah, me too. Thanks for our little talk. "
"Frasier: My pleasure. "
"Frasier: Now let's see, you got a hanky in there? "
"Martin: Yep. "
"Frasier: Terrific, alright. Have you got your keys? "
"Martin: Yeah. "
"Frasier: You're not going to be out too late, are you? "
"Martin: Frasier "
"Frasier: Dad, I'm just busting your chops here. "
"Daphne: Will you two relax? A word to the wise, "
"though: if she asks you up to her place after dinner - close the drapes "
"Martin: Hi, Irene. Nice to finally meet you. "

"Frasier: You're listening to KACL 780 on your AM dial. This is Dr. Frasier Crane. All our lines are open, so please, give us a call. Hey, Seattle, c'mon, I know you're out there. Hey, look, I realise it's a sunny day but on all those rainy days, I was there for you. Well, alright then, if that's the way you want it, you leave me no recourse... 'When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie-' "
"Frasier: That seems to have gotten you going there, okay Alright then, I knew you were out there. Okay, Roz, who do we have? "
"Roz: We have Gary from Issiqua on line two. He and his wife had a big fight. "
"Frasier: Sorry to hear that, Gar. I'm listening. "
"Gary: Well, y'see, Dr. Crane, my wife is hell-bent on going to Italy this year. "
"Frasier: Ahh, Italia - the rolling hills of Toscana, the art of Firenze, the passion that is Venizia... "
"Gary: Yeah, well, anyway - I like taking vacations as much as the next guy but I say that, if we dip into our savings, I think the first thing we should buy is a new sump-pump for the basement. At least with that- "
"Frasier: Oh, listen, Gary. Let me stop you right there. I'm afraid I'm going to have to side with your wife on this one. "
"Gary: But the trip to Italy costs eighteen hundred bucks, and that doesn't include the 'Splendours of the Vatican' package. "
"Frasier: Gary, there is more to life than sump-pumps. Whatever happened to feeding our souls? Look, for example, I recently purchased a painting by one of this country's premier artists – oh, it's not important who. Well, it's Seattle's own Martha Paxton, but... Practical? No. But ever since acquiring that painting, I look at it every day and there's not a moment when I do that I'm not uplifted by its beauty. So Gary, go to Italy, bring back a suitcase full of memories. Will you do that? "
"Gary: I still think I should get the sump-pump. "
"Frasier: Well then, yes, Gary, you... you should get the sump-pump We'll be right back after this newsbreak. "
"Frasier: Roz, just what is a 'sump-pump?' "
"Roz: If you need one, you'll know. Listen, do you really own a Paxton or were you just blowing sunshine up old Gary's skirt? "
"Frasier: Yes indeed, I do own a Paxton. "
"Roz: Well, you'll be pleased to know that she's on line three. "
"Frasier: My God, Roz, she's the preeminent Neofauvist of the twentieth century How could you put her on hold? "
"Roz: Well, the phone rang and I pushed the little button- "
"Frasier: Yes, hello, Miss Paxton. I'm so sorry to have kept you waiting. Well, thank you. I'm very flattered that you listen to my little show. Yes, well, yes, I meant every word. Yes, that's lovely, I'd like to meet you, too sometime. [sudden thought] As a matter of fact, I'm having a few friends over for a little gathering this Friday night, for cocktails and such. Well, I suppose you're far too busy to... you would Oh, that's marvelous. Alright, that's the Elliot Bay towers on the Counterbalance. Around seven is just fine. And, well, I'll see then then. Ciao "
"Roz: I didn't know you were having a cocktail party. "
"Frasier: That makes two of us "
"Daphne: Well, my theory on death "
"is: first you're whisked down a long dark tunnel towards a beautiful white light; you suddenly get all the jokes you never got before, you let out a little chuckle, and then you die "
"Frasier: That's a delightful story, Daphne, but I think the toast points need replenishing. "
"Daphne: Be right on it. "
"Niles: Enchanting, just enchanting. "
"Frasier: My God, Niles, why is no-one eating the Mussoline of Duck? "
"Frasier: Oh, you mangy little cur "
"Niles: Well, now we know why. "
"Frasier: Look, Niles, the dog is eating the food, the pianist is too intrusive, the Pinot Noir is far too stagey and it's five past seven and Martha isn't even here yet "
"Niles: I'm not going to have to sedate you, am I? "
"Frasier: No, I'm just a bit on edge, I want everything to be so perfect. By the way, where's Maris? I haven't seen her all night. "
"Niles: She's on your bed. "
"Frasier: My bed? "
"Niles: Yes, she's asleep under the guests' coats. She exhausts easily under the pressure to be interesting. "
"Frasier: Niles, she's supposed to be looking after dad. That's the only reason you're here, remember? "
"Niles: Dad is in the bathroom - don't worry. "
"Frasier: That must be la Paxton - and fashionably late, of course. "
"Frasier: Oh hi, Roz, it's you. And you look radiant. "
"Roz: I look like crap - I've got a spot on my dress, I over-plucked one eyebrow and the crotch of my pantyhose is creeping down to my knees. "
"Frasier: Couldn't you have just done that in the elevator? [takes her coat] Oh, my goodness, Roz, you've got a neck. Gee, so what do you think of the place? Is it everything you imagined it would be? "
"Roz: Well, to be frank, Frasier, I don't spend my idle hours imagining how you live. But I did expect lots of beige and, look, I was right. "
"Frasier: Would you like a drink? "
"Roz: Sure, something light would be nice. "
"Roz: Double bourbon, rocks, and spill a little in the glass. "
"Niles: Oh, Daphne, you're here, too. "
"Daphne: My goodness, Dr. Crane - shouldn't you be out there mixing? "
"Niles: Oh, don't mind me. I'm just getting some ice. [puts the ice to his forehead] "
"Daphne: Lovely party, isn't it? "
"Niles: Yes, it is. "
"Daphne: ook at this fresh fennel. [picks up a piece and sniffs it] Smells wonderful, doesn't it? "
"Niles: It certainly does. "
"Daphne: Dr. Crane, were you sniffing my hair? "
"Niles: Why would I do a thing like that? I'm a happily married man - I love my Maris. "
"Guest: Where should I put this coat? "
"Niles: Just throw it on the bed. "
"Roz: So, Frasier, which one is your dad? "
"Frasier: Oh, well, he's the older gentleman over there talking to Bethany van Pelt, showing her the photographs. Oh my God "
"Martin: ...and when we finally got to her it was only hanging by two tendons. "
"Frasier: Would you excuse us, please? Dad, will you stop showing these crime scene photos? You're embarrassing me. "
"Martin: Oh, these society people eat this up. Besides, she was the one that brought it up. "
"Frasier: Oh, she brought it up? Bethany van Pelt - the head of the Junior League - brought up the subject of a hooker whose body was hideously dismembered and scattered all over an abandoned warehouse. "
"Martin: Yeah, she asked, 'aren't these Swedish meatballs the messiest things you've ever seen?' and I said, 'no, as a matter of fact'- "
"Frasier: Dad, dad, please "
"Martin: Alright, alright, but stop shadowing me. I don't need a nursemaid. "
"Frasier: Alright, if you give me your word, that's good enough for me. "
"Frasier: You watch him "
"Roz: Hi, Niles. "
"Niles: Oh, hello. "
"Roz: You may not remember me, I'm- "
"Niles: Of course I remember you. Would you be a love and watch that man with the cane? "
"Martha: Dr. Crane? I'm Martha Paxton. "
"Frasier: Of course, who else could you be? Welcome to my salon. Everyone, everyone, your attention, please. I'd like you all to welcome our guest of honour, the renowned artist - Martha Paxton. "
"Frasier: May I take your... poncho? "
"Martha: No, no, no, no, I never take it off at parties. It gives me an excuse not to shake hands with people. "
"Frasier: Oh, how delightfully eccentric You must meet my brother, Niles. Oh, Niles? "
"Niles: Miss Paxton, Dr. Niles Crane. It is an honour to shake your hand. [outstretches his hand then, seeing no reaction on her part, shakes her poncho instead] Well, to shake anything of yours is an honour. [skulks away, embarrassed] "
"Martha: Now, where did you hang my painting? I'm always curious to know how people live with my work. "
"Frasier: 'Live with my work' - I love that phrase. If you would, right this way, please. I think this is the perfect spot for an ideal viewing. Oh God, I've waited so long for this moment - I'm just going to stand back and let you describe your work - 'Elegy in Green' – in your own words. The way you insinuate the palette but never lean on it, you capture the zeitgeist of our generation. It is the most perfect canvas it has ever my privilege to gaze upon. I mean, one can only imagine what inspired you to paint it. "
"Martha: I didn't paint it. "
"Frasier: Of course you didn't. You-you created it, you gave birth to it. "
"Martha: I didn't do anything to it - I never saw this painting before in my whole life. "
"Martin: And you thought I was gonna embarrass you "
"Martin: I really liked your friend Roz. "
"Frasier: What? "
"Martin: Roz, at the party tonight. Nice gal. Why don't you ask her out? She's great-looking and she can really hold her liquor. "
"Frasier: Dad, do you mind? I've just suffered the most humiliating evening of my life. I've been been made a fool of by this, this, this... thing. "
"Daphne: You know, I may be just a girl from Manchester but, I have to tell you, even though it's not a Paxton, I really like that picture. I liked it the minute I saw it. I liked it even before I knew who Martha Paxton was. And quite frankly, I don't think that woman bathes. "
"Frasier: Well, enjoy it while you can because, first thing in the morning, this is going back to the dealer where I bought it. I'm demanding my money back - no-one is going to take advantage of Frasier Crane. "
"Martin: You know, listen, Frasier. You're kind of upset about this, maybe I should return it for you. "
"Frasier: Well, Dad, I appreciate the gesture but, really, what do you know about the art world? "
"Martin: Apparently about as much as you do. "
"TO: * "
"Phillip: I can see the love in your eyes. You must have this painting. "
"Frasier: Are you the owner? "
"Phillip: Yes, I am. Phillip Hayson. "
"Frasier: How do you do, I'm Dr. Frasier Crane. I happen - "
"Phillip: No, not the Dr. Frasier Crane. From the radio? "
"Frasier: Guilty. Yes, but - "
"Phillip: My wife and I love your show Could I have your autograph before you go? "
"Frasier: It would be my pleasure but, speaking of autographs, I have a small problem with this painting. "
"Phillip: I'm really distressed to hear that. Would you like a glass of wine? "
"Frasier: Well, actually I - "
"Phillip: My wife and I toured the Loire valley last year and we couldn't resist buying four cases of this. [opens the bottle and pours Frasier a glass] It's really quite extraordinary - I hope you like it. "
"Frasier: Well, I'd really rather not have any wine at this moment - "
"Frasier: Well, that's rather nice, isn't it? Finishes well. "
"Phillip: Very well. Would you like some more? "
"Frasier: No, no, no, thank you. I'd... getting back to my problem - I recently gave a small but elegant soiree at which Martha Paxton was in attendance, you see. She told me that this painting was not her work. "
"Phillip: Oh dear, I can imagine how embarrassing that must have been. "
"Frasier: I doubt you can, Mr. Hayson. "
"Phillip: Please, Phillip. Let's take a look at that in slightly better light, shall we? [walks the painting over to a stand and places it on the easel] Oh, yes, I remember this - it's breathtaking. Ronald, Diane, will you step in here a moment please? "
"Phillip: Do you remember when this piece was in the gallery - everyone who saw it wanted it. "
"Diane: Yes, it's a very special piece. "
"Ronald: Mrs. Chitcherelli was heart broken when it sold. "
"Phillip: Oh, I remember - "
"Frasier: Yes, I'm sure she was but, you see, it's not a Paxton "
"Phillip: But it says right here that it is a Paxton. The signature is here. "
"Frasier: Martha Paxton says that it is not a Paxton. "
"Phillip: Oh, Martha, how is the old dear? Her and I go back a long way, is she still-? [makes a gesture to his hair - a reference to Paxton's baldness] "
"Frasier: As a Crenshaw melon, yes. "
"Phillip: Would you like a little more wine? "
"Frasier: No, I don't want any wine. I want to discuss this painting. "
"Phillip: So would I. Maybe some brie? "
"Frasier: No, I don't want any brie I want my money back. "
"Phillip: Oh, well, that's where things might get a bit... prickly. You see, we have a strict policy here at the Hayson gallery - all sales are final. "
"Frasier: But, in this case, you're willing to make an exception. "
"Phillip: Oh, I'd love to, but I can't. "
"Frasier: Yes, but it's a forgery. "
"Phillip: Well, if it is, it's a damn good one. "
"Frasier: Alright, alright, I'm going to make this simple - I want my money. "
"Phillip: I'm sure you do. "
"Frasier: Oh, I know what you're doing - you're 'handling' me. You're agreeing with everything I say hoping I'll tire and go away. "
"Phillip: Whatever you say. "
"Frasier: I don't believe it You're shining me on. You are shining me on Where is the fairness of this, where is the justice? "
"Phillip: Dr. Crane, if you ever find justice in this world, let me know, will you? Now, if you'll excuse me, I have work to do. "
"Frasier: What? Did a crate of freshly-painted Rembrandts just arrive? Damn it, you're not getting away with this I am not leaving. I am not leaving I am NOT leaving. "
"TO: "
"Martin: What are you still doing with that? I thought you were going to return it. "
"Frasier: They wouldn't take it back. All I got was some attitude and a cheap glass of wine - Loire valley, my ass. "
"Martin: What are you going to do now? "
"Frasier: Well, they've forced my hand. I'm going to call the police. "
"Martin: Five-five-five three thousand. "
"Frasier: Thanks, Dad. Try to mess with Dr. Frasier Crane, I'll teach them. Dad, who do I ask for? "
"Martin: Have them put you through to the fine arts forgery department. "
"Frasier: Hello, yes, the fine arts forgery department, please. "
"Frasier: Dad, they're laughing at me. "
"Martin: Hi, who's this? Hey, Doris. Yeah, Marty Crane. Yeah, that was my son. Yeah, I just thought he needed a bite of a reality sandwich. Yeah, yeah, give my best to the guys. Thanks. Bye. "
"Frasier: What was that? "
"Martin: Frasier, the boys downtown have their hands full of murders and robberies - they don't have time for this artsy-fartsy stuff. "
"Frasier: Yes, Dad, but what am I supposed to do? I've been cheated "
"Frasier: What were you two doing back there? "
"Niles: Maris lost her earring at the party last night. Daphne was good enough to crawl under the bed to look for it while I... "
"Frasier: Yeeeess? "
"Niles: Searched the credenza "
"Daphne: Maybe I'll go check in the hallway. It might have gotten trampled into the carpet when everybody stampeded for the elevator. "
"Frasier: No one stampeded They were all just good guests, they knew when to leave. "
"Niles: Two hours early. "
"Frasier: Oh, shut up, Niles "
"Niles: Oh, I see. Am I to ascribe this foul mood to the fact that you were unable to unload the bogus Paxton? "
"Frasier: Yes. Gee, I know, Niles. What is the name of that really vicious lawyer that you use? "
"Niles: Which one, the one I used to sue the contractor or the one I used to sue the personal trainer? "
"Frasier: Well, the meanest. "
"Niles: Uh, that would be the second one. I used him to sue the first one. "
"Frasier: Right. Ah, just give me his number, will you? "
"Martin: Ah, forget it, Frasier. Five years of litigation and you'll end up paying eight times what you paid for the painting. "
"Niles: He's right about that. "
"Frasier: God, I hate laywers "
"Niles: Oh, me too. But they make wonderful patients. They have excellent health insurance and they never get better. "
"Frasier: Say, I know, I know. I can use my radio show - why didn't I think of this earlier? I can use my bully pulpit to expose that man for the fraud that he is "
"Niles: Now, Frasier, that's slander. He'll sue you for everything you've got. "
"Frasier: Damn it, Niles, where is the justice? Where am I supposed to turn to? I'm a, a beloved household personality and I've been screwed "
"Martin: For God's sake, Frasier, you're forty-one years old. It's time you learned "
"something: the system ain't perfect. Sometimes the bad guy wins. And all those things you thought would be around to help you, the courts and the police department? Well, sometimes they're just not there when you need them. So you can either let it eat a hole in your stomach, or you can just file it away under the heading, 'Sometimes Life Sucks.' "
"Frasier: Yeah well, that file's getting pretty thick "
"Frasier: So that's that, huh? Hayson just gets away with it. He's sitting there now with his brie and his wine and his little chuckle at my expense. Gosh, you know, I finally understand why people take matters into their own hands. It would be so satisfying right now to just... slash his tires, or... throw a brick though his window or something. Just so he'd learn that you don't do this to people and get away with it. "
"Niles: Yes, well, I know you, Frasier, and I know that you'd never resort to that sort of thing. [looks at his brother, and becomes unsure] Would you, Frasier? "
"Niles: There's a vein throbbing in your forehead. "
"Daphne: Well, I couldn't find it in the hallway but let me give it one last try. Could you give me the matching earring? Maybe I'll get something from it. "
"Daphne: Oh yes, I'm getting a feeling. It's in your father's room. No, no, it's in Dr. Crane's room. Oh, this is odd, now it's in the hallway. "
"Daphne: Eddie "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Good evening. Lovely night, isn't it? Yes, well, goodnight. "
"Niles: Get in the car. "
"Frasier: Niles, what the hell are you doing here? "
"Niles: Stopping you from doing something really stupid. Now get in the car. "
"Frasier: I will not Niles, look, I know this is wrong but I don't care It's the only thing left for me "
"Niles: Alright, Frasier. Frasier, just give me the brick and no one will get hurt. "
"Frasier: Why don't you just go away? This is no concern of yours. "
"Niles: Yes, it is. "
"Frasier: How? "
"Niles: Remember that day in junior high school when somebody took all my clothes while I was in the shower, right after gym class? They hung them from the goalpost on the football field. I had no choice but to get a ladder and climb up there wearing nothing but a towel, wet and shivering. Then the towel fell off There I was - your little brother, hanging naked from a goal post, and everyone was standing around laughing, and all Coach Medwick would do was stand there going- whatever that means. ' when a "
"Frasier: Niles, why are you telling me this? "
"Niles: Because - I was so humiliated, I went home, I cried my eyes out, I swore I would get even. I was just about to put sugar into Coach Medwick's gas tank... and you stopped me. Remember what you said? 'If you act like a barbarian, you will become a barbarian.' "
"Frasier: I said that? "
"Niles: Yes. Well, actually you were more verbose at the time. I had to listen, you were sitting on my chest. "
"Niles: Give me the brick, Frasier. "
"Frasier: And let him get away with this? "
"Niles: I know, I know What the gallery owner did to you was wrong, it was humiliating. But if you throw that brick through that window, you will have lost something more valuable than your money. You will have lost... your mind. Frasier, you can't do this "
"Frasier: Well, Niles, if you were strong enough to show restraint after so much humiliation, not to mention the nicknames. "
"Niles: There were nicknames? "
"Frasier: Oh, you didn't know that? Oh dear God, yes. Uh, 'Peachfuzz,' 'Jingle Bells' - I can't remember the rest. "
"Niles: 'Peachfuzz'? "
"Frasier: Yes, I believe Coach Medwick made that one up himself. Well, anyway, here you are. I won't be needing this anymore. "
"Niles: I'm proud of you. "
"Frasier: My God, Niles What are you, what have you done? "
"Niles: I've struck a blow for justice Nobody calls me 'Peachfuzz.' Now let's get the hell out of here. "
"Frasier: Niles, what are you doing now? "
"Niles: We may be barbarians, but we pay for our pillaging "
"Frasier: Come on, come on GO, GO, GO, GO "

"One: The Frasier Crane Show. "
"Frasier: It's 4"
":25 and this is Dr. Frasier Crane. Roz, who's our next caller? "
"Roz: We have Hank on line three. He's having trouble with his neighbors. "
"Frasier: Hello Hank. I'm listening. "
"Hank: Am I on? "
"Frasier: Yes, you are on the air. "
"Hank: Hello, am I on? "
"Frasier: Hank, listen. Turn down your radio and just talk into your phone. "
"Hank: Hello? "
"Frasier: Listen, Hank please, you won't be able to hear yourself, we're on a seven-second delay. "
"Hank: Hello, can you hear me? "
"Frasier: Oh, for crying out loud. Thank you, Hank. People, would you please turn off your damn radios. [Roz immediately starts making very large “NO” gestures] No, I mean just those of you who are calling in Roz, who's our next caller? "
"Roz: We have Marco on line two. He's having problems with his relationship. "
"Frasier: Hello Marco. I'm listening. "
"Marco: Well, I uh, I started seeing this woman two years ago. I think it was two years. Um, it was around Thanksgiving. Yeah, yeah, yeah, right. The leaves were off the trees and the... "
"Frasier: Close enough. What is your problem, Marco? "
"Marco: Well, it's not really my problem, it's more like her problem. Lately she keeps pressing me for a commitment. "
"Frasier: What's holding you back? "
"Marco: I don't know, I just... I guess I just want to keep my options open. You know, in case somebody better comes along. "
"Frasier: 'Somebody better comes along.” Somebody better comes along? Marco, Marco, Marco, do you hear yourself? "
"Marco: No, I turned my radio off after you blasted that other guy. "
"Frasier: Well listen, I suggest you give your motives a thorough examination, and if you can't commit, it's best for both of you to break it off. Thank you for your call. Tell me listeners, what is it with guys like that? Hey Roz, you've been around the block a few times. You ever run into a guy like Marco? "
"Roz: Oh, they're all Marcos. You can't swing a dead cat without hitting a Marco. "
"Frasier: Come on. I mean, if that were so, then no-one would be having a relationship. "
"Roz: Well, I'm not. My sister's not. None of my friends are. I've seen the future, and its name is Marco. "
"Frasier: What do you think, Seattle? Are there any non-Marcos out there? Or is Roz here destined to live a life of hopeless, loveless spinsterhood? Back after this. "
"Roz: Gee, I just love it when you include me in your show. "
"Two: Frasier's apartment. "
"Martin: This is really weird. It’s not even Halloween yet. Do we really have to do this now? "
"Daphne: If we're going to have a picture for the Christmas card, we’ve got to make it look like Christmas. "
"Martin: I don't know why we just can't do what my wife and I did - put Frasier and Niles in matching sweaters and sit them on the hood of the old Packard. "
"Daphne: Well, this year we're going to be a little more artistic, right? "
"Martin: Where the hell is Frasier anyway? I could use some help here. "
"Daphne: He's still napping. My grandfather used to nap every afternoon. He lived to be ninety-three. "
"Martin: Really? "
"Daphne: He'd lie there on the sofa, and you couldn't wake him for the world. Grammy would say 'He might as well be a dead man.' Then of course, one day, we couldn't wake him. He really was a dead man. Poor Grammy. For weeks she'd keep insisting, 'He's napping, he's napping'. "
"Martin: Okay. I'm going to turn it on. "
"Daphne: Oh, it's lovely. "
"Both: 'Deck the halls with boughs of holly; Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la 'Tis the season to be jolly; Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la' etc. "
"Frasier: Excuse me, excuse me. Exactly how long have I been asleep? "
"Martin: Oh good, you're up. Now we can get this picture taken. "
"Frasier: What picture? "
"Daphne: The picture for the Christmas card. We told you about it last week, remember? "
"Frasier: Oh, oh right. "
"Daphne: Now the theme this year is “Santa's Workshop.” Everybody put on your little elf hats. "
"Frasier: I am not putting this on my head. For God's sake, I mean, I'm a respected professional. "
"Martin: But if you don't, it'll look stupid. "
"Frasier: Oh, I think the ship has already sailed on that one. "
"Martin: Just put the hat on, Frasier. "
"Frasier: You can't tell me what to do. "
"Martin: I am telling you, look, put the hat on. "
"Frasier: No, look, the days are past when you can just sit me on top of some stupid old Packard and make me wear matching sweaters with my little brother. "
"Daphne: Boys, boys please. Don't fight. Are you forgetting what day it is? "
"Frasier: It's October 21st "
"Martin: Can we just get the picture taken, please? "
"Daphne: Alright, I've got it all set. Fifteen seconds, gents. Oh, wait. There's something missing. Where's Eddie? "
"Martin: Oh, he's in the bathroom, getting a drink. EDDIE "
"Frasier: Well, I can always pray there's a postal strike. "
"TO: "
"Three: Radio Studio "
"Frasier: Well, that's just about it for today. This is Dr. Frasier Crane, saying go on out there and make it a great evening, Seattle. "
"Roz: Hey, before you go, there's a fan in the hall who'd like your autograph. "
"Frasier: Oh, God. Save me from my adoring fans. "
"Frasier: Ooh... ooh, but not from the adorable ones. "
"Frasier: Hello. Ah, my producer told me you wanted an autograph. Ah, how should I make this out? "
"Catherine: You disgust me You parasitic fraud "
"Frasier: Well, that's certainly different from the usual “Best Regards.” "
"Catherine: Wait a minute, don't walk away from me. For once you're going to face the consequences of what happens after you hang up on your callers. "
"Frasier: What consequences? What are you talking about? "
"Catherine: I'm Marco's girlfriend. Excuse me - ex-girlfriend, thanks to you. "
"Frasier: Marco? You mean the Marco who-didn't-want-to-commit Marco? "
"Catherine: Ah, you damn radio shrinks You couldn't just tell him to stick with it. That kind of advice doesn't get big ratings. No, “break up with her, get on with your life and ruin hers.” Now that's entertainment. "
"Frasier: Now just hold on one minute. Did you actually listen to the show? "
"Catherine: ...No. But Marco told me what you said. "
"Frasier: Oh he did, did he? Did he also mention that he said that he was only staying with you to “keep his options open?” Because that's what he told me. To be exact, he said he was only staying with you “until somebody better came along.” "
"Catherine: He said that? "
"Frasier: He said that to most of Seattle. Apparently you're the only one who missed it. "
"Catherine: So, it wasn't that he didn't want to commit. He just didn't want to commit to me. "
"Frasier: Well I'm... I'm terribly sorry I had to tell you. But, um, at least now you know the truth. Oh, no-no-no, don't cry. You're in a place of business here. "
"Catherine: Ooh, boy, I can really pick 'em, can't I? "
"Frasier: Oh no, don't go there. Look, this is not your fault. You are a terrifically attractive young woman - I mean, maybe a bit overemotional... "
"Catherine: OOHH "
"Frasier: Oh, yes. There, there. Shh... listen, can I... can I get you something? "
"Catherine: No. "
"Frasier: A drink of water? "
"Catherine: No. "
"Frasier: M&M's? "
"Catherine: Plain or peanut? "
"Frasier: Whichever you like. "
"Catherine: Peanut. "
"Catherine: I should have seen this coming. I mean, the guy practically had a coronary when I brought a toothbrush over to keep at his apartment. "
"Frasier: Here. "
"Catherine: Thank you. You want one? "
"Frasier: Ah, no thanks. Ah, why don't you have a seat here. [indicates chair] "
"Catherine: Thank you. "
"Frasier: But listen, if... if he was that resistant, why did you stay with him? "
"Catherine: I had a lot invested in him. "
"Frasier: Yes, but that's no reason to settle for someone who isn't madly in love with you. "
"Catherine: Well, right now I'm not sure there are any men out there who are actually capable of falling madly in love. "
"Frasier: Of course there are. You know, at the most basic level men and women are the same. We both need to be loved, and to love someone, we both want to feel that we matter to someone and that someone matters to us. And making a commitment to another human being is the ultimate expression of our humanity. "
"Catherine: Wow. Your wife is really lucky. "
"Frasier: I'm sure she'd say the same thing, especially now that our marriage is over... well, maybe I will have one of those M&M's. "
"Catherine: Oh, boy. Why are relationships always so hard? Hey, [indicating Frasier's choice of M&M] you like the yellow ones too, huh? "
"Frasier: Yeah. You know, people try to tell you they're the same but... "
"Catherine: I know. "
"Frasier: But they're not. "
"Catherine: No. "
"Frasier: Well, you know, relationships don't always have to be so hard. I remember back in med school, I heard of a documented case where a man and a woman met, got along, and actually lived happily ever after. "
"Catherine: Yeah, I don't mind the happily ever after part. It's the dating part. If I have to tell one more stranger the fascinating story of my life over more Italian cuisine I'm gonna choke on a breadstick "
"Frasier: I know. You know, I just keep thinking that maybe we can just resume this over appetizers. "
"Catherine: Oh, no, no. Half the time I'm ready to exchange goodbyes over appetizers. "
"Frasier: Well, at least you don't get stuck with the bill. "
"Catherine: God, you haven't dated much lately, have you? "
"Frasier: No. I usually end up in restaurants alone. "
"Catherine: Oh, I can't do that. I even have to turn on the TV at home so at least it feels that there's someone else in the room. "
"Frasier: Is that what you'll be doing tonight? "
"Catherine: Well, unless I just keep eating M&M's, which is a distinct possibility. "
"TO: "
"Four: Cafe Nervosa. "
"Frasier: “Soft and supple, yet strong, right down to the beautiful almond- shaped nails.” You really see all of that in my hand? "
"Catherine: Mmm. I'm late. I gotta go to work. "
"Frasier: Oh, wait, wait. We haven't decided what we're gonna do tonight. Ah, Antonio's? Le Cigar Volante? "
"Catherine: We've gone out for the last three nights, why don't we just stay in, huh? "
"Frasier: That's a great idea. I'll tell you what. I'll uh, send dad and Daphne off to the movies. I'll cook for you. Be at my place at eight. "
"Catherine: Oh, I won't be able to make it 'til eight-thirty, I gotta change, okay? "
"Frasier: Oh, no-no-no-no. Don't ever change - I like you just the way you are. Oh, come on, come on, I'm a little out of practice. "
"Catherine: I'll see you later, okay? "
"Catherine: Bye. "
"Niles: I'll dispense with the usual adolescent teasing and come straight to the "
"point: who was that babe-o-rama? "
"Frasier: Niles, please don't try to be hip. You remind me of Bob Hope when he dresses up as the Fonz. "
"Niles: Coffee. "
"Frasier: Her name is Catherine. "
"Niles: So? How long have you known her? "
"Frasier: Three days. "
"Niles: Have you two, uh...? "
"Frasier: No. As if it's any of your business. "
"Niles: But you're, uh..? "
"Frasier: Well, yes. Soon. "
"Niles: We are talking about...? "
"Frasier: Of course we are. "
"Niles: ...Sex, right? "
"Frasier: Yes "
"Niles: Ooh, so-so-so... how did you two meet? "
"Frasier: Well, I mean, it was one of those funny things, she came down to the radio station to chew me out. "
"Niles: You're kidding. "
"Frasier: No. A few days earlier her boyfriend had called into the show, and I advised him to break up with her. "
"Niles: Frasier, Frasier, where are your ethics? You can't date someone who's involved with one of your patients. "
"Frasier: Marco is not a patient, he's a caller. There's a huge difference. Besides, I talked to him days before I met Catherine. "
"Niles: Mmm, rationalization - the last refuge of the unsound argument. "
"Frasier: Oh, rationalization, is that what you're going pull now? "
"Frasier: Oh Niles, I am not rationalizing There is nothing wrong here. "
"Niles: As long as your conscience is clear. I'm not sure mine would be. "
"Frasier: Well frankly, I don't care about your conscience. I don't need your approval, I don't need you to like it. Frankly, I don't need you for anything. By the way, Niles, my car's in the shop, I need you to give me a ride home tonight. "
"Niles: No problem. "
"One: The radio station, Roz's booth. "
"Roz: Twenty seconds. And I've got news for "
"you: Marco's on line two. "
"Frasier: Marco? "
"Roz: Oh, you know. The guy you got out of the way so you could keep his girlfriend for yourself? [Frasier goes into the recording booth] Ten seconds. "
"Frasier: I'm not talking to him. I don't want to talk to him. There's no way I'm talking to him. "
"Roz: Three, two... "
"Frasier: Hi, we're back. Roz, whom do we have on the line? "
"Roz: We have Marco on line two. "
"Frasier: Who's this on line three? "
"Roz: Ooh, Todd. Oh darn, we lost Todd. [Frasier is not amused] But lucky for you we still have Marco on line two. "
"Frasier: Thank you, Roz. Hello, Marco. "
"Marco: Hi, Dr. Crane. I spoke to you the other day and I took your advice. I broke up with my girlfriend. "
"Frasier: Well, what can I say but, ah... Bravo, Marco Roz, who's our next caller? "
"Marco: Wait, wait-wait-wait. You haven't heard my problem. I think she's already dating someone else. It really makes me nuts. "
"studio: "
"Frasier: What makes you think she's seeing someone else? "
"Marco: Well, the other night I couldn't get her on the phone. So I drove by her house, and I saw her parked outside talking to some guy in a black BMW. "
"Frasier: Did you, ah... get a good look at the guy? "
"Marco: No. It was too dark. I think I made a big mistake, Doc. Do you think I should ask her to take me back? "
"Frasier: No What I mean is, ah... no. Marco, you don't want your ex- girlfriend back, you just don't want anybody else to have her. Isn't that true? "
"Marco: Well, I... "
"Frasier: No, it's called jealousy, Marco. Now you've got to stop spying on your ex-girlfriend and get on with your life. Borrow a page from my book - ah, move to a new city, a new state. Find out why everybody's talking about Pittsburgh "
"Frasier: We'll be right back after these messages. "
"Frasier: What? "
"TO: "
"Two: Niles's car. "
"Frasier: Thanks for coming to get me, Niles. "
"Niles: No problem, Frasier. Just a few miles out of my way. At rush hour. But I didn't mind, really. Gave me a chance to listen to your show. "
"Frasier: I see. "
"Niles: I just have one question for "
"you: can you honestly tell me that the advice you gave Marco was based on his best interests and not on your own? "
"Frasier: Well, that's an interesting question, Niles. And I'll tell you something. I don't care. I'm in love, and I don't care. Catherine is mine now. I'm in, and Marco's out. "
"Niles: You're insane. "
"Frasier: Perhaps. But you just ran a stop sign. Now we're in the middle of the intersection. [car horns blare, Niles drives on] I'll tell you, Niles, I, ah... I haven't Felt this way in ages. There's an excitement about this. I, I feel tingly. "
"Niles: What's your stomach have to say about this? "
"Frasier: My stomach? "
"Niles: I definitely know what I'm talking about. Ever since you were a child, if you even approached a breach of ethics you'd get queasy. Actually, you'd get physically sick. "
"Frasier: Well, at least when it came to ethics I didn't get spontaneous nosebleeds. "
"Niles: Remember the time we lifted that dollar bill from mom's change purse? We left quite a gruesome trail back to the tree house that day. "
"Frasier: Ah, but you see, Niles, you've proved my point. I'm not the least bit queasy, I'm fine. My head, my heart, my gastrointestinal system, they're all shouting the same thing - It's okay [looks around] Niles? Niles, this is a new car? "
"Niles: Yes, actually it is. Patient of mine got me a huge break on a lease. Frasier, do you have a handkerchief? "
"TO: "
"Three: Frasier's Apartment. "
"Catherine: Mmm. That was the most delicious salmon Marseilles I've ever tasted. "
"Frasier: Well, maybe you should try my “salmon-chanted evening.” "
"Catherine: Oh, no. Tell me you didn't say that. "
"Frasier: No, it was just the Laffite talking. “Laffite don't fail me now.” "
"Catherine: C'mon, stop, stop. "
"Catherine: So, have you ever made love in the kitchen? "
"Frasier: Well, the ah, dishes are done. "
"Catherine: Mmm, ah, ah... "
"Frasier: Mmm, oh, ah... "
"Catherine: What was that? "
"Frasier: I'm sorry. I'm suddenly feeling a little queasy. Maybe I'm just not a kitchen person. "
"Catherine: Well ah, maybe you're just a little too warm, huh? [starts to unbutton his shirt] Yeah? "
"Frasier: Well, yeah. "
"Catherine: Oh, God... "
"Frasier: Yeah, that's it. You know, you look awfully warm too. "
"Catherine: Oh, I am. "
"Frasier: Oh, my God. "
"Catherine: Yes, oh... "
"Frasier: I'm sorry. Would you... would you mind if we, if we moved to the sofa? I'm not going to be out-performed by a Barcalounger. "
"Catherine: No. "
"Frasier: Oh, this is good. "
"Catherine: Yes, it is. "
"Frasier: This is better "
"Catherine: Oh... "
"Frasier: Eee-ugh "
"Catherine: What? Was I kneeling on you? "
"Frasier: Really, maybe I need some fresh air. Are you okay? "
"Catherine: Oh, I'm fine, I'm fine. "
"Frasier: Oh damn, it wasn't the fish "
"Catherine: You know there's a bug going round. "
"Frasier: It's not a bug. "
"Catherine: Well what is it, then? "
"Frasier: It's us. Every time we touch and kiss I get queasy. "
"Catherine: What are you telling me? That the thought of making love to me makes you sick to your stomach? "
"Frasier: Yes, but don't take it personally "
"Catherine: Well, why would I? "
"Frasier: It's, it's not you. Ah, it's, it's me. Every time I come close to breaching my ethics, I-I end up getting sick. "
"Catherine: What are you talking about? "
"Frasier: Marco called into the show today and... he said he was thinking of getting back with you and I told him not to. "
"Catherine: So? "
"Frasier: Well, I just have a feeling that... maybe I told him that not because it was good for him, but because it was good for me. "
"Catherine: Oh, Frasier, who cares? "
"Frasier: Well, I do. I care. You know? Look, any psychiatrist worth his salt would care. That's why we don't get involved with our patients. Or their girlfriends. "
"Catherine: Are you, are you saying you want to break up with me? "
"Frasier: No, I don't want to. I have to. If I don't, I'll throw up all over your shoes. "
"Catherine: I can't believe this is happening. God, how can this be so easy for you? "
"Frasier: Easy? This is killing me You think I don't want to pick you up right now, carry you over to that Eames classic and show you why it's the best-engineered chair in the world? "
"Catherine: Well, why don't you then? "
"Frasier: I told you, I can't. "
"Catherine: Oh And nothing I can say will change your mind? "
"Frasier: I'm sorry. "
"Catherine: Well thank you, Dr. Crane First you screw things up with Marco, and now you're dumping me? God And to think I was going to have sex with you. And it was going to be hot. Oh, like you've never had before. I'm talking raw, steamy, sweat-dripping-down-your-back, neighbors- pounding-on-the-wall, ILLEGAL-IN-FORTY-EIGHT-STATES-KIND-OF-SEX But, hey You're okay, you won't be alone tonight. No, you’ve got your ETHICS "
"Catherine: Oh, by the way... the fish was dry. "
"Frasier: Oh, that was a cheap shot "
"Frasier: How I envy you, Eddie. The biggest questions you face are “who's going to walk me?” “Who's going to feed me?” I won't know that kind of joy for another forty years. "

"Frasier: Danielle, you're going to have to slow down a little bit, I'm having a hard time understanding you. "
"Danielle: I'm sorry, Dr. Crane. I'm having a big, big problem with my monsieur. "
"Frasier: Excuse me, with your what? "
"Danielle: My monsieur. "
"Frasier: Your mithyuer? "
"Danielle: Oui, my monsieur. Every day... "
"Frasier: Is that your mother? "
"Danielle: No. My monsieur. "
"Frasier: Your masseur? Your Mercedes? "
"Danielle: Monsieur My monsieur You must help me. "
"Frasier: Well Danielle, I, I, um... the best advice I can give you is to umm... either confront your mithyuer, or um, work on your self-esteem. Thank you for your call. This is Dr. Frasier Crane, saying go out and have a good night, Seattle. You deserve it. "
"Frasier: Roz Aren't you screening these calls? "
"Roz: Yeah. But when you only have one, you get a little less particular. "
"Frasier: You look nice. "
"Roz: Yeah? Well, I've got a date tonight. "
"Frasier: Oh, great... Why are you only wearing one heel? Did you break it off? "
"Roz: No, I'm dating a sea-captain with a peg-leg and this makes it easier when we dance. I broke it off in a sidewalk grate. "
"Frasier: Okay, so who is this guy? Another one of those trendy young kids who's got three earrings and a ponytail, wearing a T-shirt under his sports coat? "
"Roz: Is he here? "
"Frasier: Roz Where do you meet these people? "
"Roz: For your information, this guy happens to be a very successful media consultant. He graduated from Princeton, he has a house on Mercer Island and he owns a forty-foot sailboat. "
"Frasier: You met him on a bus, didn't you? "
"Roz: No. Actually we shared a cab... Alright, he was driving it. "
"Niles: Hello, Frasier. "
"Frasier: Hi, Niles. You remember Roz? "
"Niles: Yes, of course. What brings you here? "
"Roz: Just passing by and thought I'd stop in for a career. "
"Niles: Good luck. Sorry I'm late, Frasier, but the entrance to your parking garage is blocked by a cab driver with a ponytail, scraping gum off his back seat. "
"Frasier: Well, we better get going, Niles. "
"Niles: Oh actually, bad news on that score, Frasier. I'm afraid the lecture's been cancelled. "
"Frasier: Oh. Well, I can't say I'm really disappointed. I wasn't relishing the idea of three hours on “Right brain, Left brain synergy.” "
"Niles: I'll have you know I trimmed that speech to two and a half hours and I opened with a really funny Al Gore joke. "
"Frasier: Well, it's no use crying over spilt milk. Now... we've got a free evening. This sound like the perfect opportunity for a couple of guys on the loose to, ah... hit a sports bar, have a couple of brewskis, maybe take in a game or two. "
"Niles: Right. What shall we do? "
"Frasier: Dinner? "
"Niles: Perfect. No place fancy, I'm sure neither of us wants a heavy meal with lots of wine and expensive desserts. "
"Frasier: Oh, it's your turn to pay, isn't it? "
"Niles: You know me so well. "
"Niles: Thank you. "
"Frasier: Thank you. "
"Niles: Are you sure it's all right to park in that lot across the street? The sign says it was just for customers of those stores, I don't want to get a ticket. "
"Frasier: No, it's fine, Niles. "
"Niles: I mean, I could get just nip back to Crabtree & Evelyn and buy a bar of lavender soap, just to be safe. "
"Frasier: Oh Niles, Niles. Sit down. Lavender soap - for God's sake, you're a man, you'd look ridiculous. "
"Waitress: Can I get you a drink? "
"Frasier: Fuzzy Navel, blended nice and frothy, please. And a... martini, Niles? "
"Niles: No thanks, I'm driving. Maybe I'll buy a bag of Potpourri, or a set of hand towels. "
"Frasier: Just sit down. "
"Niles: Frasier. Unless my eyes deceive me, that's Dad sitting over there. "
"Frasier: God, you're right. Gee, that's strange, he said he was going over to Duke's to have a beer with a couple of the boys. "
"Niles: Well, that certainly isn't the boys. Seems we've caught him in a clandestine rendezvous. "
"Frasier: The sly boots. He had a date, and he didn't want us to know. "
"Niles: Oh, he's looking this way, turn around, turn around "
"Frasier: What are they doing? "
"Niles: Well, it's sort of cute. He's holding her hand. Don't look, don't look. I'll tell you when you can look. Not now... Not now... Okay, now. [Frasier looks] No, not now Oh, I don't like this one bit. "
"Frasier: Why, what are they doing now? "
"Niles: Oh nothing, I just realized if Dad's eating here this can't be a very good restaurant. "
"Frasier: You know, I wonder if it's their first date? "
"Niles: Well, if it is, they seem to be having a very good time. "
"Frasier: Why, what are they doing? "
"Niles: Well, they're leaning in and talking to each other. He's smiling at her, she's... just collapsed in tears, she's sobbing uncontrollably. "
"Frasier: Oh, yeah. That's a Crane first date all right. "
"Niles: She's coming this way, hide. Frasier, do you know who that is? "
"Frasier: She did look familiar. "
"Niles: I'd swear that was Marion Lawler. "
"Frasier: Marion Lawler? My God, I haven't heard that name since I was a kid. "
"Niles: I thought Mom and Dad had a huge falling-out with the Lawlers. "
"Frasier: They did, they did. It was that last summer we shared a cabin with them at the lake. "
"Niles: Well, maybe Dad's getting together just to patch things up. "
"Frasier: And doing his usual bang-up job. "
"Niles: This is really awkward. We should just get out of here. "
"Frasier: No, Niles. If we leave now, he's sure to spot us. [looks out the window] You know, Niles, maybe you should have that martini after all. "
"Niles: I can't drink, Frasier. I'm driving. "
"Frasier: Not anymore, they just towed your car. "
"TO: "
"Daphne: Eddie, you little hooligan. Get off that couch. You know you're not supposed to do that. If Dr. Crane sees you, he's going to throw you off the balcony and I'll be right behind you. Good boy. Now just stay there. "
"Frasier: Well, Eddie. Glad to see my rules about the couch are finally taking hold. "
"Frasier: Good dog. Dad? Daphne? "
"Daphne: Oh, hello Dr. Crane. "
"Frasier: Hello, Daphne. Say, where's Dad? "
"Daphne: Mr. Dawcy down on eight invited him over to watch the ball game. "
"Frasier: Oh, great. He's finally getting to know some of the neighbors. "
"Frasier: What are you staring at? "
"Daphne: Have you ever thought about growing a moustache? "
"Frasier: No, I don't think it would suit me. "
"Daphne: Oh, yes it does. "
"Frasier: You've never seen me with one. "
"Daphne: Actually, I have. There's a billboard for your show down on Sixteenth Street. Some kids went at you with a can of spray paint. "
"Frasier: And it looked good? "
"Daphne: Oh, yes. But a word to the wise - take good care of your teeth. That look is not at all flattering on you. I'll get it. Hello, Dr. Crane. "
"Niles: Hello, Daphne. "
"Daphne: What brings you here? "
"Niles: A rental car, thanks to my brother. "
"Frasier: I assume you're here for a reason? "
"Niles: Ah, yes. Frasier, last night when I got home, that strange incident with Dad and Mrs. Lawler got me to thinking, what was it that caused the rift between our two families? So, I dug out my old boyhood journal, and looked up my entries from our last summer together at the lake. According to this, there was a three-week period where Mom and Dad had screaming matches every night, after we went to bed. "
"Frasier: I don't recall that. "
"Niles: Oh, that's right. That was the same period where you insisted on wearing the wax earplugs and the slumber mask. "
"Frasier: Well, I had to, what with you underneath the covers with a flashlight looking at the National Geographic. "
"Niles: I was looking at the maps. "
"Frasier: That's what makes it so scary. Now what was your point? "
"Niles: Well, according to my journal, something more provocative happened during that same period. Here, read this. [hands over book] "
"Frasier: “Though summer at the lake seems but a vapid, vacuous experience, it is a necessary tonic for my troubled youth...” Niles, how old were you when you wrote this? "
"Niles: Almost nine. Which explains the redundancy – “Vapid” and “Vacuous.” "
"Frasier: Well... "
"Niles: By ten, my writing had gotten considerably tighter. "
"Frasier: Amongst other things. "
"Niles: The point is, that same night I crept out onto the screen porch, leaving the lights off so not to attract bats and moths. As I peered out through the darkness, between the trees I saw the figures of Dad and Mrs. Lawler in each other’s arms. I think it's pretty clear what happened, Frasier. Dad and Mrs. Lawler had an affair. "
"Frasier: Oh, come on, Niles. Look, I appreciate your attempt to spice up our family history, but really - look, we're not a Jackie Collins novel, it's ridiculous. "
"Niles: Is it? All right, allow me to present Exhibit B. This is a photo album Mom prepared of photos from the same period. "
"Daphne: Ooh, I love to see old family photos. My goodness – what a handsome, sinewy young bloke. "
"Frasier: Yeah, that was our dad. "
"Daphne: You two take after your mother, don't you? "
"Niles: All right, all right, look at this picture. And this one here. That's Dad, but the person next to him has been cut out. And, if you look at this one you can still see the edges of a dress and a handbag and tan sandals. "
"Daphne: Here's one whose head should have been cut out. That scrawny little chap with the fish-belly complexion and rain hat. "
"Niles: I was under doctor’s orders to stay out of direct sunlight. "
"Frasier: Look, we don't know for sure if that was Mrs. Lawler. And besides, even then it wouldn't prove that Dad had an affair with her. "
"Daphne: What are you two talking about? "
"Frasier: Oh, Niles has this theory that Dad had an illicit affair when we were youngsters. "
"Daphne: Your father? I can't believe that, he's not the type. "
"Frasier: Well, that's what I think. Besides Niles, there's not enough proof. "
"Niles: Well, are you saying it's not possible? "
"Frasier: Oh, anything is possible. "
"Daphne: Then why don't you just ask him? "
"Frasier: Right. “Good evening, father. By the way, did you boff one of the neighbors while we were roasting marshmallows?” "
"Niles: Ah, ah. There's one sure way to get the truth. We'll call Aunt Vivian. "
"Frasier: Oh, no. "
"Daphne: Who's Aunt Vivian? "
"Niles: Better known as The Mouth. Keeper of the Crane family skeletons. "
"Frasier: No, Niles, we are not calling Aunt Vivian. "
"Niles: Why? Are you scared you'll find out something you don't want to know? "
"Frasier: Yes. That she knows where I live and that she still drives. "
"Daphne: You two are worse than a couple old washerwomen gossiping over a back fence. I'm telling you, the way to sort this is to ask your father. "
"Martin: Ask me what? "
"Daphne: Your sons here have some cock-eyed notion that you had an affair with some woman thirty years ago. "
"Martin: What? Where the hell'd that idea come from? "
"Niles: Well, last night... Frasier saw you having dinner with Marion Lawler. "
"Frasier: You were with me "
"Martin: So what were you doing, spying on me? "
"Frasier: No, no Dad, we were just having dinner together - at the same time when you were supposed to be having some drinks with your buddies at Duke's. "
"Martin: And that proves I had an affair thirty years ago? "
"Frasier: No, no. But Niles dug out his journal and then he remembered this time when he saw you and her hugging, and it was right around the same time when you and Mom seemed to be fighting a lot. "
"Niles: And then you suddenly stopped seeing the Lawlers. "
"Martin: I don't believe this, this is stupid. "
"Daphne: That's what I told them. The hens here were even going to give some Aunt Vivian person a call. "
"Martin: Ah... Daphne, would you give me a minute alone with these two? "
"Daphne: Of course. I completely understand. [under her breath, as she leaves] That's right, send the help to her room. I never get to hear any of the good stuff anyway. "
"Martin: Look, don't bother calling Aunt Vivian. You want to know the truth? Fine. I had an affair. It happened a long time ago and it's not anything I'm proud of. And now that I've answered all your questions, do me a favor. This is never to be brought up again, understand? End of discussion. "
"Niles: Well... it's times like this that most families pull together and draw strength from each other. What shall we do? "
"Time: 12"
":20) "
"Frasier: Oh, thank you. "
"Niles: Good, you're here. I came by to see how you're doing, but I only have a few minutes. I start my “Healing with Humor” support group tonight, and I still have to pick up my big shoes. "
"Frasier: How am I doing? How are you doing, Niles? Doesn't it bother you that your father cheated on my mother? "
"Niles: Frasier, your loyalties are seeping through, and I might point out that I got Mom's small features, while you got Dad's chunky thighs. "
"Frasier: The point is, that it must have caused Mom a great deal of pain. "
"Niles: Agreed, but they went on and had a very happy life together. They got over it. Why can't you? "
"Frasier: I know that rationally I should be able to handle this. I deal with people who exemplify human frailty every day. "
"Frasier: But in this case it's not people, is it? One of our parents had an illicit affair. How could he cheat with Marion, knowing the effect it would have on Mom, not to mention the repercussions it would have on you and me later on... Why don't you just pull up a chair and join us? "
"Frasier: I just can't believe that it's our father. You know, I never had a great relationship with him. But if there was one thing I always respected about him, it was his integrity. Just thinking about what they did, it just sickens me. "
"Niles: Frasier, as your brother, as a therapist, I think you have to let this go. And a good first step would be to come with me to my “Healing with Humor” support group. "
"Frasier: Thank you Niles, but I think I just need a night to myself. "
"Niles: Well, if you change your mind it should be a hoot. As we speak, I'm wearing oversized polka-dot boxers and quick-release suspenders. "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Well, I see all sorts of things have been going on behind my back "
"Marion: Frasier? "
"Frasier: Yes. "
"Marion: You may not remember me. Marion Lawler. "
"Frasier: Yes, I remember you. "
"Marion: Is your dad home? "
"Frasier: Ah, no. but if you come back later you can have the place to yourselves. "
"Marion: No, that's not necessary. I had dinner with him the other night, and I left rather abruptly. I just wanted to tell him I'm sorry. Would you please give him my best? "
"Frasier: Oh, I think you've already done that. "
"Marion: Did I come at a bad time? You seem upset. "
"Frasier: Would you come in for a moment, please? After you met with Dad the other night, ah, he and I had a little conversation. That was the first time I learned what happened that summer. "
"Marion: Oh, I'm sorry. "
"Frasier: Well... I guess I'm not the sort of person who can hear news like that and just sweep it under the rug and forget about it. "
"Marion: I know you're upset. But if it's any consolation, in time your father and I forgave them. "
"Frasier: Forgave them? "
"Marion: Frasier, your mother was a good person. So was my husband. They made a mistake. Anyway, just tell your father I stopped by. I felt so silly crying in front of him the other night. I've been a little overemotional since Dan died. "
"Frasier: Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know. "
"Marion: Well, you never know how hard that's going to hit you. Look who I'm telling this to - the famous radio psychiatrist, Dr. Frasier Crane. I remember you when you used to run around in your undies with your pail and shovel. "
"Frasier: Yes, well I rarely get to the shore anymore. "
"Marion: Well... goodbye, Frasier. "
"Frasier: Goodbye. "
"TO: "
"Daphne: Working down at the docks has always been a tradition for us Moons. My father worked on the docks, and me grandfather before him. All my brothers do. Well, except for my brother Billy. He came home one day, and announced he hated the smell of fish and was going to teach ballroom dancing. And he did. And he does. He's my mum's favorite. Dad mostly flicks the crust off his kidney pie at him. "
"Martin: How much longer do I have to do this? "
"Daphne: Be patient. You don't want to go through life dragging your leg behind you like a dead tree branch. "
"Martin: I'm talking about listening to your family’s history. "
"Daphne: Now, I know you don't mean that. Why would a man of your intelligence say a thing like that when you're in the position you're in- and I'm in the position I'm in? "
"Martin: All right, all right "
"Daphne: Up you come. That's much better. I'll go run your bath. "
"Frasier: Hi, Dad. You look kinda tired. "
"Martin: Yeah. Just finished my exercises with Nurse Ratchet. "
"Frasier: Ah, listen Dad, do you have to watch the TV right now? "
"Martin: Yeah, my program's on. "
"Frasier: Well, you know, if either of us could work the VCR, we'd tape it. But, ah, just for now there's something I'd like to talk to you about. "
"Martin: Oh, for God's sake, Frasier. I know what this is, I've already told you everything I'm going to. Now drop it. "
"Frasier: Dad. Why didn't you tell me the truth? "
"Martin: I did. "
"Frasier: Marion Lawler came by today. She wanted to apologize for the other night. While she was here, she... she told me what really happened. "
"Martin: Alright, so now you know. You did your little digging, and you stuck your nose in where it didn't belong, are you happy now? "
"Frasier: Why didn't you tell me it was Mom? "
"Martin: Because it's none of your damn business, and it still isn't. "
"Frasier: Look dad, I don't blame you for being defensive, but I had a right to know. For your information, this sort of thing happens to a lot of people. If it’s any consolation, I know exactly how you feel. I never told you this but, um... Lilith did the same thing to me. "
"Martin: Lilith had an affair? "
"Frasier: The most painful and humiliating experience of my entire life. Well, I'm sure you felt the same way. "
"Martin: Well, I hadn't thought about it for quite some time, but thanks for reminding me. Lilith? "
"Frasier: I found her attractive. I mean, is it so inconceivable that another man might find her attractive as well? "
"Martin: I guess. So who was the bozo in your case? "
"Frasier: Oh, God. A Frenchman who lived in a self-contained underground eco-pod. "
"Martin: Well, that still sounds better than a urologist with a bad comb-over. "
"Frasier: I'm sorry, dad. "
"Martin: Look son, do me a favor. Don't hate your mother for this. I wasn't the easiest person to live with back then, and she had plenty of reason to do what she did. Luckily we were able to put it behind us, but I'll tell you... there were times when it really tore me up. I loved your mother. "
"Frasier: So did I. "
"Martin: I'm sorry. That's why I said I was the one who had the affair. I was just trying to protect her. Hey, me you already had problems with. "
"Frasier: Well dad, I appreciate what you did, but ah, I still think you should have told me. "
"Martin: Listen. When Frederick grows up, will you tell him what Lilith did to you? "
"Martin: Okay. Can I watch my program now? "
"Frasier: Oh, no. Just one second. There's one thing I gotta clear up. There's this photo album here, there's all these pictures with the same woman that's been cut out of them, you see this? "
"Martin: What else do you notice, Sherlock? Like, where's your mother? "
"Frasier: Oh. Oh, that was mom? "
"Martin: She cut herself out of it. She put a few pounds on that summer. I think that day she was wearing a brown dress with a belt, and your Aunt Vivian told her she looked like a knockwurst tied in the middle. "
"Frasier: You know dad, ever since you moved in we've been trying to find something that we have in common. I think we've finally found it. "
"Martin: Yeah... wish it was a birthmark. "
"Frasier: So do I. "

"Roger: Well, I had a really good year. I decided hey, why not reward myself? So I bought what I really wanted - a forty- eight foot cabin cruiser. Want to know how much it cost me? I'll tell you how much it cost "
"me: three hundred grand, not to mention the twenty thou for the custom teak decking. Now, here's my "
"problem: the wife wants to call this incredible vessel Lulubelle, after her mother. Lulubelle So I say, 'no, we call it the Intrepid.” So what do you think it should be called? Lulubelle or the Intrepid? "
"Frasier: Roger, at Cornell University they have an incredible piece of scientific equipment known as the tunneling electron microscope. Now, this microscope is so powerful that by firing electrons you can actually see images of the atom, the infinitesimally minute building blocks of our universe. Roger, if I were using that microscope right now... I still wouldn't be able to locate my interest in your problem. Thank you for your call. "
"Frasier: And now, “Hungry for Chinese tonight? I always”... Uh, I'm sorry, I just - we're experiencing technical difficulties. Let's go to a pre-recorded commercial message. "
"Frasier: Roz, why did you hand me this copy? I don't do personal endorsements. "
"Roz: What is the big deal? All the other personalities do them. "
"Frasier: The other personalities aren't doctors. If I allow myself to become a common pitchman, I lose all my credibility. I am a wise man, a shaman. "
"Roz: Zip up your fly, wise man. "
"Bulldog: Whoa, Doc This is a radio studio, not a bus terminal. "
"Frasier: Look who's here, Roz. Noel Coward. "
"Roz: Listen Bulldog, I hate to mix business with revulsion, but Frasier, as usual, will not do this promo... "
"Bulldog: Love to. "
"Roz: Great. I need it done now. "
"Bulldog: No problem. Doc, doc, with all due respect, you're an idiot. These promos are easy money. "
"Frasier: The money is irrelevant. It's a question of integrity. "
"Bulldog: Integrity? Hello? We're talking mucho dinero. But hey, the more you turn these down, the more liver snacks for the Bulldog. "
"Frasier: What is this with my name on it here, Roz? "
"Roz: Oh, that's the contract for the “Hunan Palace” gig. It's how much they were going to pay you. "
"Frasier: Wow. "
"Roz: I guess I need to have them change the name on here to Bulldog's. "
"Frasier: They pay you that much money just to read some copy? "
"Roz: Yeah. Of course, Bulldog usually adds his own special touch. "
"Bulldog: Aww, so you come chop-chop to “Hoo-nan Parace,” where Pekin’ duck is awrays extla clispy "
"Roz: We're gonna get sued this time, for sure. "
"Frasier: Damn it I just put a dent in my front bumper when I pulled into my parking space. Does anybody know what happened to that tennis ball I hung over my space so I wouldn't pull up too far? "
"Martin: He was bored, he needed a toy. Hey, go ahead and throw it, he'll run and get it for you. "
"Martin: He didn't think that was funny, and he knows where you sleep. "
"Frasier: Dad, Daphne, a situation has arisen over at work and uh, I'm not sure how it should be handled. I was hoping maybe your objective viewpoint could uh, be helpful. "
"Martin: Sure, shoot. "
"Frasier: Well, what would you think if I did a commercial and publicly endorsed a product? "
"Daphne: Oh, you mean like Cher does? "
"Frasier: Thank you Daphne, one against. Dad? "
"Martin: What's the product? "
"Frasier: Well, the station wanted me to do a commercial for a Chinese restaurant. "
"Martin: Well, what's the problem? "
"Frasier: Well, I hold a position of trust in this community, and people do what I tell them to, and I would hate to be accused of abusing that position. The thought of a doctor selling things is kind of distasteful, don't you think? "
"Daphne: What about Dr. Sneezy's cold medicine? "
"Frasier: Dr. Sneezy is a cartoon character. The fact that he's a giant purple hippopotamus should have probably tipped you off. "
"Martin: I say take the money and run. "
"Frasier: Well, you know, I'm tempted, if for no other reason than to keep Bulldog from further alienating the Asian-American community. I just want to make sure I don't compromise my principles. "
"Daphne: Dr. Crane, you've dedicated your live to helping people, haven't you? "
"Frasier: Well, yes. "
"Daphne: Well, suppose one of your listeners was in a quandary over where to buy good Chinese food? Wouldn't your commercial be helping them? "
"Martin: Look, why don't you just go down there? If you like the food do the commercial, if you don't, don't. "
"Frasier: I suppose that's the logical approach. Why don't the three of us go tonight? I'll make a call. Oh, I'd better make the reservations under a different name, I don't want any special treatment, you know. I want them - I just want to be treated like an average working Joe. Good evening... Yes... yes, we'd like a reservation for three this evening at eight. Oh, nothing 'til ten? Oh, well then, ah, this is Dr. Frasier Crane... from the radio, and ah... Yes, I thought you might. Thank you. We're in at 9"
":45. "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Did I say tasty? Tasty doesn't do justice to those succulent pot-stickers. And the kung pao chicken - ooh, don't get me started. “So if you've got a yen for Chinese tonight, hurry on down to the Hunan Palace.” Well, that's it for today. This is Dr. Frasier Crane hoping we'll see you tomorrow, on KACL 780 AM. "
"Frasier: You know Roz, I think I'm getting the knack for doing these promos. Did you hear that little ad-lib I did about the “yen” for Chinese food? "
"Roz: Yeah. By the way, “yen” is Japanese, not Chinese. "
"Frasier: Well... Did I tell you, I got a call from the owners of the Hunan Palace the other day, they said that since I started doing these commercials their business had gone up by 30 percent. "
"Roz: Well, isn't that what advertising is supposed to do? "
"Frasier: Yes it is, Miss Sour-Britches, give me a little credit. My God, I've pleased the boys upstairs, I've gotten perfect strangers to try a new restaurant, and most importantly, I've helped a struggling immigrant family who came to these shores a mere twelve years ago, with nothing more than a dream, a few recipes, and a wok. "
"Bebe: Dr. Crane? What a privilege this is. "
"Frasier: Excuse me? "
"Bebe: Bebe Glaser. I'm Bulldog Briscoe's agent. "
"Frasier: Ah. Ah, well. Pleasure meeting you. "
"Bebe: Listen. I'm not usually this forward, but I'm going to come right out and say it. I've done some research and I know you're not represented by anyone, how would you feel about signing on with me as a client? If your answer is no, it won't hurt my feelings. "
"Frasier: Well, I really don't think so. "
"Bebe: Why? "
"Frasier: It's not that I'm not flattered, Miss Glaser, but umm... you see, I'm not really a radio personality per se. "
"Bebe: Oh come on, Dr. Crane, I've heard those spots you've done for that Chinese restaurant, you make me want to stuff my face full of egg rolls and... I don't know what. "
"Frasier: Thank you. Uh... but I, you see, I dine at the Hunan Palace frequently, and uh, that's the only reason I did those commercials. "
"Bebe: The last thing I would ever want you to do is to advertise something you don't believe in. I am an agent, not a pimp. "
"Frasier: Well, I don't mean to offend... "
"Bebe: Are you kidding? You're terrific, you can't offend me. Let me just leave you with my card. "
"Frasier: Well, I really don't think that's necessary. "
"Bebe: Give me back my card. I will not let you call me. It is too refreshing to meet someone who isn't seduced by the almighty dollar. I would refuse your call. Ah, I've got to go. Flying to Palo Alto, my daughter's at Stanford. Ah, wait. You don't have kids, do you? "
"Frasier: Well yes, I have a five year-old son. "
"Bebe: Lucky you, you won't have to worry about it for years. [starts to leave again] "
"Frasier: Worry about what? "
"Bebe: Tuition, innocent. Oh wait, I see. You're going to send him to a state college. "
"Frasier: Well no, no. I plan to send him to my alma mater, Harvard. "
"Bebe: Ouch Kiss it and make it better. Have you seen Business Week's projection for college costs in the year 2010? [gives a small, high pitched squeal] Oh I've got to go, that plane is not going to wait for little Bebe. "
"Frasier: Well, you know, maybe we should talk, sometime. "
"Bebe: Let's talk now. I think I can die peacefully without seeing the first half of the Stanford-Cal game. "
"Frasier: You see, it's not that I object to doing commercials, it's just that I would have to try a product first before I could endorse it. "
"Bebe: Dr. Crane, I wouldn't have it any other way. "
"TO: "
"Martin: Tell me again why I'm here? "
"Frasier: Because if I do the commercial I have to say that my friends and family enjoy this, and I won't say it unless it's true. "
"Daphne: I feel kind of silly sitting here in the showroom. "
"Frasier: Well I apologize for that, but it's the best place to try one. So, tell me the truth. Aren't you two enjoying this? "
"Daphne: Well, I do like the bubbles. It's a little like sitting in hot champagne. Not that I've done that very much. "
"Frasier: Dad, did you know that this unit is made from the same heat resistant space-age polymer that's used on the NASA space shuttles? "
"Martin: Great. Next time I'm re-entering the earth's atmosphere in a hot tub I won't have to worry. "
"Frasier: Well? Do you like it? "
"Martin: ...I have to admit, it's making my hip feel a little better. "
"Frasier: That's all I needed to hear. My friends like it, my family likes it - I like it. I can do the commercial and Frederick can go to Harvard. Oh my god Isn't that Dave Hendler from our building? You know, he's the head of the Seattle Psychiatric Association. "
"Daphne: That's not Dave Hendler. "
"Martin: Shh, don't worry about it. Enjoy the quiet while you can. "
"Advert: ...soothing bubbles, bubbles that will ease your aching body. This is Dr. Frasier Crane. In these pressure-packed times, what could be better that a warm, relaxing dip in a Renwood hot tub? Let Renwood's patented Ultra-Blow air system surround your body. My family and friends like it... "
"Daphne: That's us. "
"Advert: ...and you'll like it too. And if you act quickly, you'll receive a complimentary scum guard. So hurry down to your Redwood Hot-tub dealer. Say Frasier Crane sent you. "
"Frasier: Well? What do you think? "
"Daphne: I could almost smell the chlorine. "
"Frasier: Dad? How about you? "
"Martin: I liked it. "
"Frasier: Really? "
"Martin: Yeah. I liked it. "
"Frasier: You really, really like it? "
"Martin: No, I liked it. "
"Frasier: Well, what was wrong with it? "
"Martin: Nothing. "
"Frasier: You hated it, didn't you? "
"Martin: Yeah. Goodnight, Frasier. "
"Bebe: Hello, darling. "
"Frasier: Bebe. "
"Bebe: First off, mea culpa for dropping by unannounced, but you are going to kiss me when you hear what I've done for you. "
"Frasier: Oh... hello. "
"Daphne: Hi. "
"Frasier: Oh, no no no no no. Bebe, this is Daphne Moon, my father's physical therapist. [Bebe laughs, as if to say “the very idea.”] Well, I believe I was about to kiss you for something. "
"Bebe: Well, today I got a very attractive offer for you to be a product spokesman, and we know they're serious because it's pay or play. "
"Frasier: Ooh... "
"Daphne: That's the best kind. You get your money whether you do it or not. "
"Bebe: Well, listen to this one. "
"Frasier: How do you know that? "
"Daphne: Well, I must confess, there is a chapter of my life I haven't told you or your father about. Back when I was twelve, I starred in a television show in England. Well, I'll leave you to your business. "
"Frasier: Daphne, Daphne, just get back here. You what? "
"Daphne: I starred in a TV series. It was quite popular in its day, maybe you've heard of it? “Mind Your Knickers”? It was about a group of high-spirited, ethnically diverse twelve-year-olds in a girls’ private boarding school. I played Emma, the short, spunky one. Of course, by the end of the series, I was sixteen, five foot ten, and they had me boozies bound up tighter than a mummy. Well, I'm off. "
"Frasier: The woman is like an artichoke. You just peel away one astounding leaf after another. Well anyway, back to business. What have you got for me? "
"Bebe: Voila. Emery's Nuts. "
"Frasier: Oh, dear. Oh, I can't endorse these. "
"Bebe: Why not? "
"Frasier: Well, for one thing I don't like them, and they're sixty percent fat, they're laced with salt and they wreak havoc with my diverticulitis. "
"Bebe: Of course they do, they're nuts. "
"Frasier: I'm sorry, I'm afraid I can't. "
"Bebe: Well... then I will just tell them they can take their five figure deal and find someone else. "
"Frasier: Five figures? "
"Bebe: Didn't I mention, precious? This is for television, the big kahuna. "
"Frasier: Television? "
"Bebe: Well, I understand if you have a problem. "
"Frasier: Well I-I... I don't mean to be difficult, I do have my standards, you know? I only endorse things that I like or... or I think are therapeutic, like the hot-tub. "
"Bebe: Let me pinch you, you're not real "
"Frasier: Well... "
"Bebe: But still, I... I wonder if you're not being the tiniest bit shortsighted. Research has shown that a single television commercial can turn an obscure radio personality into a national celebrity... a year from now, someone like you could be broadcasting your message of hope and healing not just to the Pacific Northwest, but to the entire nation. But of course, there's not much I can do about it if you don't like the product. "
"TO: "
"Frasier: I've never been one hundred percent happy with my nose. "
"Bebe: You can't be serious. That's a nose people trust. "
"Bebe: Finally, a script. Thanks, Jeff. Seen it already, you're going to love it. "
"Frasier: “Two nuts are arguing with each other.” That's cute. “‘I'm a nut.’ ‘No, I'm a nut’” Ha, that's funny. Ah... “‘Hold it, you're both nuts. I'm Dr. Frasier Crane, noted psychiatrist, and I know a nut when I see one.’” Hmm, I just, I don't know abut that line. "
"Bebe: Oh, what's wrong? It's a scream. "
"Frasier: Yes, but it... it may be a scream, but it, it's... what's the word I'm looking for? "
"Bebe: What? “Tuition?” “Retirement beach house?” I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry, it's just that I want so much for you. "
"Frasier: Bebe, I don't want to get a reputation for being difficult, but I... I'm just not comfortable with this line. "
"Bebe: Frasier? Frasier, Frasier. How long have we been together? "
"Frasier: Six days. "
"Bebe: Do you think I would ever have you do something that you were uncomfortable with? What makes this so wonderful is that you're spoofing yourself, you're showing that psychiatrists can be loose, you're making shrinks more accessible to the average person. "
"Frasier: So what you're saying is that I would be doing psychiatry a service by doing this commercial? "
"Bebe: You have a way of cutting through the baloney that knocks me out cold. "
"Frasier: Oh, dear. What does this mean? “Frasier comes out of his shell.” "
"Bebe: It is a... technical term. It's a light... a lighting thing. You, you see, you come out of your shadow, or your shell, into the light. "
"Frasier: I have so much to learn about this business. "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Oh Niles, Niles, thanks for meeting me, I have to talk to you about something. "
"Niles: Why do you have that ridiculous tissue around your neck? "
"Frasier: Well, they didn't tell me I could take it off, so I kept it on. "
"Niles: Oh, silly me. Here I thought it was just a means to attract attention, to have people come up to you and say, “Are you an actor?” thus affording you the opportunity to say yes, you are indeed an actor, and then proceed to crow, gloat and strut in a way you could not otherwise do. "
"Frasier: And the reason you have “SHRINK” on your license plate would be...? Niles, listen. I've got to do this commercial in half an hour and... I just don't think I can go through with it, I'm afraid that I'm compromising my integrity as a psychiatrist. "
"Niles: Why do you feel like that? "
"Frasier: Well, for one thing my co-stars are dressed up as an almond and a walnut. Now listen Niles, I've... I need your guidance. "
"Niles: Frasier, I don't see this as a problem. "
"Frasier: You don't think this is the selling out of Frasier Crane? "
"Niles: Oh, certainly not. You sold out a long time ago. You know, the moment you agreed to do that call-in show, you sold out. "
"Frasier: Oh, Niles. You are such a purist. Granted, I can't do the kind of in-depth analysis one can with a single patient, but my show helps literally thousands of people a day. "
"Niles: Let's face it, Frasier, you talk about wanting to safeguard your professional dignity, but the first time you went on the air, you got out of medicine and into showbiz. You're no different from that movie star who let everybody look up her skirt in that film, and then did nothing but complain that nobody took her seriously as an actress. "
"Frasier: Well, that has nothing to do with this "
"Niles: Have you seen that movie? Maris and I rented the video and, I don't mind telling you, we pushed our beds together that night And that was no mean feat. Her room, as you know, is across the hall. "
"Frasier: Niles, will you just tell me, would you do it? "
"Niles: A nude scene? I suppose if it were integral to the plot... "
"Frasier: Not a nude scene Would you do this commercial? "
"Niles: Oh, certainly not, I'm a respected psychiatrist. [looks at watch, then stands] "
"Frasier: So what you're saying is that I shouldn't do it. "
"Niles: No, no no no. I'm saying it doesn't matter. Let's face it, Frasier - they've already looked up your skirt and they've seen everything there is to see. "
"TO: "
"Martin: What are you still doing up? [sees Frasier rewinding the video] Oh geez, you're not watching the tape of that dumb commercial again "
"Frasier: I can't get it off my mind. Did I do the right thing? "
"Martin: Of course you did. Freddie's gonna thank you for it. "
"Frasier: Here, watch it with me one more time. "
"Advert: Stop You're both nuts I'm noted psychologist Dr. Joyce Brothers and I'm here to tell you that I'm just crazy about Emery's Nuts. So if you're crazy about nuts too, pick up a can of Emery's today. Emery's - the nut lover’s nut. "
"Frasier: I suppose you're right, dad. Freddie will thank me. Dr. Joyce is his favorite psychologist. "
"Martin: You know, Dr. Joyce is pretty good. I remember her from “Hollywood Squares.” She was always under Charlie Weaver. "
"bed: "
"Frasier: No, no. Charlie Weaver was always on the bottom. "
"Martin: No, I don't think so. Let's see, Paul Lynn was in the middle, George Goldblum was under him, and... where was Wally Cox? "
"Frasier: Wally Cox. Uh, upper left, next to Rosemarie Dubarr. "
"Martin: Oh, right... "

"A: Café Nervosa. "
"Niles: So I just had to get out of the house. Maris's Junior League are rehearsing their spring musical - this year they're doing “Cats.” The past week and a half I've been watching two dozen underweight, tightly-pulled woman in leotards crawling round the music room, meowing. I'm telling you Frasier, my allergies are acting up. "
"Frasier: Oh Niles, I think you're exaggerating. "
"Niles: No. No, really. You've no idea how vivid the experience is. As God is my judge, I swear, Mrs. Presley-Bismouth was scent- marking the divan. "
"Frasier: God, you'd think women of that age would choose more suitable material. Remember the last show they did, “The Sound Of Music”? My God, half the Von Trapp children were having hot flashes. "
"Roz: Hi, Frasier, Niles. "
"Niles: Let me guess. The wacky gang from the office? "
"Frasier: Everyone, this is my brother Niles. This is Teddy, one of our brilliant engineers.. "
"Teddy: Niles. "
"Niles: Teddy, my man "
"Frasier: This is KACL's inimitable “Chopper” Dave. Your Eye in the Sky for traffic. "
"Dave: NICE TO MEET YOU, NILES "
"Niles: Why is this man yelling? "
"Dave: Oh, was I yelling? Oh god, I was yelling again, wasn't I? I'm sorry, talking over the blades, you know? Whoomp- whoomp-whoomp-whoomp-whoomp-whoomp... "
"Niles: This has been kind of fun, ah, but I really have to go. I'm conducting a seminar on multiple personality disorders, and it takes me forever to fill out the name tags. "
"Frasier: Well, KACL team, what is on the agenda for today? "
"Roz: Sit down and listen to this. I got a juicy piece of news, and it's reliable. Alan in Accounting got it from Steven in Promotions, who got it from Cindy in Retail Sales, who got it from Arlene, the station manager’s secretary - that the station is definitely way over budget, and somebody's getting the ax. But don't tell anybody, I was sworn to secrecy. "
"Frasier: Roz, I'm ashamed of you Gossip, gossip, gossip. Don't you know how destructive that can be? It does nothing but sully good people's names and create an atmosphere of suspicion and mistrust. "
"Roz: Oh, lighten up. Gossip is the lifeblood of the corporate world. If it wasn't for gossip, we wouldn't know any of the important things, like how much everybody makes. "
"Frasier: You know my salary? "
"Dave: NO-ONE'S SALARY'S A SECRET AROUND HERE. "
"Bulldog: Ninety-four, ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven... "
"Teddy: Hey, Bulldog. How's it going? "
"Bulldog: Great – ninety-eight, ninety-nine, one hundred - new high for me. "
"Roz: Squeezing or counting? "
"Bulldog: Java to go. "
"Dave: YOU KNOW WHO I THINK'S GETTING DUMPED? FATHER MIKE FROM “RELIGION ON THE LINE.” "
"Roz: No way. Station loves him. Just gave him a big bonus. "
"Bulldog: Hey, where's my tickets to the Sonics game? They were here just a second ago. SOMEBODY STOLE MY TICKETS TO THE SONICS GAME THIS STINKS THIS IS TOTAL B.S THIS IS... oh, got 'em. Got 'em. "
"Roz: Hey. You guys don't think it's Bulldog who's getting canned? "
"Teddy: Could be. "
"Frasier: Oh, no no no no. He's the station's highest-rated personality. I mean, with the exception of women thirty-five to fifty-four who happen to think that I'm... sort of a god. "
"Teddy: But he has been in that salary beef with management. "
"Roz: And I heard him screaming at business affairs for putting his expense account on hold. "
"Dave: OH YEAH, BULLDOG'S OUT "
"Bulldog: Hey. Have you heard about my new gimmick for the show? If the Seahawks beat Buffalo this Sunday, I promise to do my entire show hanging by my feet. "
"Frasier: You can do that? "
"Bulldog: Oh, sure. Practiced all morning. The real trick is drinking coffee. I keep burning my eyes. Hey, Dave. Want my tickets to the Sonics Game tonight? "
"Dave: THANKS WHY AREN'T YOU GOING? "
"Bulldog: Ah, station manager wants to see me after work. "
"Roz: Ooh... "
"Frasier: Oh people, people. You're jumping to conclusions. Show a little respect. Bulldog has devoted fifteen years of his life to radio. My own personal feelings aside, the man deserves better than to become the object of some scurrilous rumor that as yet hasn’t a shred of truth to it. "
"Roz: Yeah. I suppose you're right. "
"Frasier: Yes, well... just in case, I've got dibs on his parking space. "
"B: Radio Station. "
"Roz: Dr. Crane, we have Don on his car phone. He's having a problem with his weight. "
"Frasier: Don, it's a common problem. I'm listening. "
"Don: Ah, it's the screwiest thing, Doc. I eat healthy, I work out. But no matter what I do, I can't lose a pound, it's very depressing. "
"Frasier: Yes, well, losing weight can be a lifelong struggle. It takes a commitment. Now, if you're ready to accept that, there are a number of things I can suggest... "
"Waitress: May I take your order, please? "
"Frasier: Uh Don, what was that? "
"Don: Ah – oh, nothing. It was the radio. Go ahead, you were talking. "
"Frasier: Don...? Where are you? "
"Don: I'm just driving around. "
"Waitress: Hey, speak into the clown's mouth "
"Frasier: Don...? "
"Don: Sorry, Dr. Crane. I'm going to lose you. I'm going into a tunnel. Goodbye "
"Frasier: Yes, and the light at the end of that tunnel is a heat lamp over a large order of fries. We'll be right back after the news. "
"Roz: Hey Frasier, I've got to run up to payroll, be back in five. "
"Frasier: Okay. "
"Frasier: Oh, hi Father Mike. "
"Mike: Oh, hello Frasier. "
"Frasier: How you doing? "
"Mike: Say, I just heard a rumor that somebody 'round here is being let go. Do you know anything about that, because to tell you the truth, I'm afraid it might be me. "
"Frasier: Oh Father, Father. You should better than to put any stock in idle office gossip. "
"Mike: I know, I know. But it's hard not to. My numbers have been down lately, they keep changing my timeslot. I'm really bummed "
"Frasier: Well, listen Father. I don't like to engage in gossip, but you have nothing to worry about. "
"Mike: Yes? Why? "
"Frasier: Well, someone is being let go... "
"Mike: Oh? "
"Frasier: But ah, it's not you. It's Bulldog. "
"Mike: Bulldog? Oh, what a shame. "
"Frasier: Yes. "
"Mike: Has anybody spoken for his parking space? "
"Frasier: Well I have, yes. "
"Bulldog: So I'm a goner, huh? "
"Frasier: Bulldog. Well, how long have you been...? "
"Bulldog: Long enough to know I'm the one who's out. [starts banging head on table] I knew it, I knew it, I knew it Damn it Now I know why Ned Miller wants to see me after work. It's to can my butt. I mean, why else would he be willing to miss happy hour at El Paquito's? The man's a total boozer "
"Frasier: Now, now now now now, Bulldog listen, this is just a rumor. You know how out of the loop I am. "
"Bulldog: Oh, yeah. And after all I've done for this lousy station, this is how they repay me? Well, that's it Nobody fires Bob Briscoe I'll quit first. "
"Frasier: Now, now now. Don't do anything rash. Now listen, I suggest you try to vent your anger first. "
"Frasier: Well... there, way to go. Now, on your way. "
"Bulldog: You're damn right. "
"Roz: Hey, Bulldog. "
"Bulldog: No time to talk, slim, I'm off to war "
"Bulldog: Wait for me. "
"Roz: Oh What was that? "
"Frasier: Bulldog's quitting. "
"Roz: Why? "
"Frasier: Well, because Ned Miller is firing him. "
"Roz: Who told you that? "
"Frasier: You did. "
"Roz: That was just a rumor... You didn't tell him that, did you? "
"Frasier: I didn't mean to, he overheard me. "
"Roz: Oh, God "
"Frasier: What? Come on, you guys were so positive - the expense account thing, the meeting with management at five? "
"Roz: That meeting was to discuss taking his show national Don't you know anything that goes on around here? "
"Frasier: Apparently not "
"Roz: Well, don't just stand there. Go call his secretary, she'll stop him before he gets in. "
"Frasier: I don't believe this, this is incredible, Yes, hello, hello Arlene? Arlene, yes, listen. Bob Briscoe's about to jump into the office and... oh. God, he's already burst into the office with Miller. Oh god, this is a disaster. "
"Roz: Maybe not, maybe not. Maybe before Bulldog starts anything Miller will tell him what the meeting was really about. "
"Frasier: Well I, I suppose you're right. For all we know they may be having a good laugh about this right now. "
"Roz: Grab that mike. We're out of the news in one minute. "
"Bulldog: I did it I scorched him You should have seen the look on his face. Oh, I even told him about the time his wife came on to me at the Christmas party. I said there wasn't enough liquor in the world to make me sleep with that porker "
"Frasier: You said that to Ned Miller? "
"Bulldog: Yes Yeah, he even took a swing at me. I gave him a little okey-doke and he hit air "
"Frasier: My god, the man tried to strike you? Listen, Bulldog... "
"Bulldog: Hey, hey No sudden moves, doc. I'm still too pumped. I feel like poppin' someone. "
"Frasier: My god, my god, this is unbelievable. A man has quit his job just because of a rumor that you spread "
"Roz: Me? The whole point of gossip is to talk behind the person’s back, not in front of him. I didn't realize you were unclear on this concept "
"Frasier: I'm a bad, bad man. "
"Roz: Well Frasier, you have got to do something. You gotta call Ned Miller and get this whole thing cleared up. "
"Frasier: Oh, right. “Call Ned Miller, clear this thing up.” The man is totally unstable, he tried to take a swing at me the day he hired me. "
"Dave: OOH, JUST HEARD A HOT RUMOUR BULLDOG QUIT "
"Frasier: No kidding. "
"Dave: BUT KEEP IT UNDER YOUR HAT VERY HUSH-HUSH "
"C: Frasier's Apartment. "
"Martin: Niles, what brings you here? "
"Niles: Well, I was hoping Daphne could take a look at this plant. I bought it for Maris but it unaccountably turned against her. I thought Daphne was the perfect person to nurse it back to health with her soft, sensual hands and her loving... manner. Is she here? "
"Martin: No, she stepped out. I don't know when she'll be back. "
"Niles: Well, I'm off. "
"Martin: What, hey You can stay. I haven't seen you for a while, you can visit. "
"Niles: Well, yes we could, couldn't we? "
"Niles: ...So, how are ya? "
"Martin: Fine. You? "
"Niles: Fine... She's fine. "
"Martin: ...Pickle? "
"Niles: No, thanks. "
"Martin: ...Look Niles, if you just came to see Daphne, you don't have to stay. "
"Niles: Dad, I can't believe you would say that. To your own son. I am deeply insulted. Here I wanted to have some time with you but now I'm so upset I'll have to leave. [heads towards door again, just as Daphne enters] "
"Daphne: Oh, hello Dr. Crane. Staying for dinner? "
"Niles: Yes, love to. "
"Niles: Daphne, I had the fervent hope that you could coax this back to life. It's one of Maris's favorites. "
"Daphne: My goodness, what did she do to it? "
"Niles: Nothing. Just loved it. "
"Frasier: God. Can you believe this weather? "
"Martin: Oh, Frasier. I'm glad you’re home. What happened to Bulldog? "
"Frasier: Who told you? "
"Martin: Nobody told me anything. I turned into the “Gonzo Sports Show” today like I always do, and they had Father Mike filling in. I hate that. All it was, was “Notre Dame, Notre Dame, Notre Dame.” "
"Frasier: Yes, well, Bulldog tended his resignation. "
"Martin: Oh, no. Why would he do that? He's the top sports guy in town. "
"Frasier: Well, you know, things just go funny sometimes. It's a tough business, this radio game, you know? "
"Daphne: Dr. Crane, I'm picking up something from you. You're shrouded in an aura of guilt. "
"Frasier: ...Maybe I am. "
"Niles: Daphne, that's fantastic. Do me, do me. "
"Daphne: No, I'm on to something here. You actually think you're responsible for Bulldog losing his job. "
"Martin: Frasier? "
"Frasier: All right, all right. Ah, there was a rumor going ‘round the station that Bulldog was going to get sacked, and then... I was repeating it to someone and he overheard me and flew off the handle, went up and quit his job. In the end it turned out that the rumor wasn't true. Of course, you already knew that, didn't you? "
"Niles: Oh, excuse me. Hello? Maris... Maris? What's wrong? It's all right... no, no. Everything's going to be... Oh, dear. Sorry, I have to go. Maris is despondent. They kicked her out of the cast of “Cats.” "
"Daphne: Why? "
"Niles: She couldn't remember the words to “Memory.” "
"Martin: Now listen here, Frasier. If you're responsible for Bulldog losing his job, you've got to make this right. You gotta go down to that station and talk to the boss and get him his job back. "
"Frasier: Well, that's a little easier said than done. Ned Miller is the most intimidating, heartless, mean-spirited man I've ever had the misfortune to meet. "
"Daphne: And he cheats on his wife... My goodness, I'm on today. "
"Martin: So you're selling Bulldog down the river just 'cause you don't have the guts to go and face this guy? "
"Frasier: No, no. For all we know this might just be the best thing that ever happened to him. You know, he's always talking about how he should be in a larger market, like Los Angeles, or New York... "
"Frasier: Eddie, scoot. Scat. "
"Frasier: Oh, Bulldog. "
"Bulldog: Hiya, Doc. "
"Frasier: Well, what are you doing, just standing there? "
"Bulldog: ...I don't know. I was trying to decide whether or not I should bother you. See, my life is kinda over, but you got company, so I'll go. "
"Frasier: No, no-no-no-no. Come in, come in, it's just family. This is my dad, and Daphne Moon. "
"Martin: Hey, Bulldog. You're soaking wet. "
"Bulldog: Yeah, I been wandering around the streets for the last few hours. "
"Martin: I heard what happened. "
"Bulldog: You haven't heard the half of it. [grabs Frasier's sherry and throws it back] My girlfriend threw me out. She said the only reason she was with me was because I was on the radio. Can you believe that? Eight years we've been together. I loved that woman. Even when I was tomcatting around, I loved that woman. God, that job was my life, and now I've been blackballed in this business, and all because of my stupid temper. [picks up a piece of African art] What is this, anyway? "
"Frasier: Oh, that's an exceedingly rare fertility symbol from a small nomadic tribe in Ghana. "
"Bulldog: I guess when they were passing out equipment, this guy was in the back of the line. Anyway, I might as well face it, I'm just a loser, I'm a zero, I'm nothing, a has-been.. "
"Martin: Pickle? "
"Daphne: Now, I'm not familiar with your work myself, but Mr. Crane often puts off his nightly bath just so he can hear your show. "
"Martin: Oh, yeah. You're the greatest, Bulldog. If you weren't on the radio, I wouldn't have a radio. "
"Bulldog: That's a nice thing to say. Now I know why your son is such a great guy. I've bothered you people enough. I better go. The good rooms at the “Y” fill up early. [Martin and Daphne stare at Frasier again] "
"Frasier: Wait. Bulldog, I can't let you leave like this. [goes into his pocket] Here's a twenty. Oh, all right. Why don't you just spend the night, you can take the couch. "
"Bulldog: Wow. You'd do that for me? "
"Frasier: Why sure, what's the point of having an expensive suede couch if you can't have a bunch of people crashing on it? "
"Bulldog: Thanks, Doc. Hey, I hope it's okay, but I could really use a hot shower. "
"Frasier: Oh sure, sure. "
"Daphne: Down the hall, second door on the left. Towels are in the cabinet. "
"Frasier: Now, you two just leave me alone. This is not my fault. Look, I am not responsible for Bulldog going up there and popping off to the boss. You can stare at me 'til you're blue in the face, I'm not going to go see Ned Miller. "
"Frasier: Oh, all right I'll go down to the station, I will talk to the monster on the sixth floor and futilely attempt to get a man back his job that I don't even care for, and in the process I will probably end up spitting out my teeth like Chiclets Is there anything else I can do for you? "
"Daphne: Oh, if you're going by the market, we're low on dog food. "
"TO: "
"D: Ned Miller's office. "
"Miller: What, what? "
"Frasier: Mr. Miller... "
"Miller: Oh, it's you, Crane. "
"Frasier: Look, I don't mean to disturb you, but Arlene wasn't at her desk. "
"Miller: I had to let her go. A lot of stuff she's been doing lately's been ticking me off. "
"Frasier: If this is a bad time... "
"Miller: No, it's a perfect time, I need you to hold this. [indicating picture] Come on. Now "
"Frasier: Okay, how's this? "
"Miller: I'd love to tell you, but your big head's in the way. "
"Miller: Ah, put it down. "
"Frasier: Oh my lord What happened here? "
"Miller: Oh, that psycho Bulldog and I got into it this afternoon. He threw my Golden Mike at me "
"Frasier: And he did that with your little trophy? "
"Miller: No, he just chipped the paint with the trophy, I did that with his head "
"Frasier: Ah. That's, ah, sort of why I'm here. "
"Miller: Drink? "
"Frasier: No. No thank you, Mr. Miller. Um, I know that Bulldog was up here, and he said some... pretty regrettable things to you. "
"Miller: I'll say he said some things. You want to hear them? I tape everything in this office. "
"Frasier: Well anyway, ah, a lot of what he said was, ah... was my fault, you see? Well, you see, I heard a rumor that, ah, management was thinking about lightening the load a bit. Well, I heard it was Bulldog that was gonna get sacked and I... I was repeating the rumor to someone and Bulldog heard me. And that's why he came up here and started telling you... "
"Miller: That I'm a drunk, that I'm incompetent at my job, that my wife is a big fat slut "
"Frasier: That is indefensible Your wife is not overweight Well anyway, my point is that, um, I'd like you to reconsider giving Bulldog his job back. And ah, whatever the consequences to me, I'm willing to accept it. "
"Miller: Look, I won't kid you. Bulldog meant big numbers to us in Drive Time, we need him back. Tell you what - you get him to apologize to me... oh hell, why don't I just say it? If he'll kiss my ass, maybe we can work something out. "
"Frasier: Oh sir, sir, I'm sure that'll make him so happy. "
"Frasier: Well, I'll just, ah, get out of you hair. "
"Miller: Actually Crane, that uh, rumor about someone being let go is, uh... true. "
"Frasier: What? "
"Miller: Now that you've so nobly gotten Bulldog his job back, the station still needs to make some cutbacks on those high-priced salaries. "
"Frasier: Oh god, not Father Mike? Oh, no. "
"Miller: No. It's not Father Mike. "
"Frasier: Chopper Dave? Ray the Greengrocer? Bonnie “the Auto Lady” Weems? "
"Miller: Look, Crane. You're new to the radio game, I've been around a long time. People get fired. But they always get back on their feet. So... I bet you I could get you that drink now? "
"Frasier: Yes, I bet you could. "
"Miller: Help yourself. "
"Miller: Ned Miller Yo, Jack No, what's wrong? Ah, come on, tell me now. Uh-huh. I see. No, no no, I-I... Thanks, Jack. "
"Miller: Excuse me. "
"Frasier: Bad news? "
"Miller: Oh, you could say that. I've just been fired. They decided the best way to cut the budget was to get rid of MY high salary. "
"Frasier: Oh, Ned, I... I'm so sorry. Then I guess this means that my job is still safe, then? "
"Miller: Yeah. I guess so. "
"Frasier: Well, you know Ned... I haven't been in the radio game that long. But, uh, I've been around long enough to know that people get fired. And when they do, they always seem to land on their feet. Now I've known quite a few people - and counseled them - that have suffered similar setbacks. But, ah, in time you will embrace this. Learn to think of this as, oh, a new chapter. You know, in theatrical circles, they always say “Every exit is but an entrance to somewhere else.” "
"Miller: God, I wish I'd fired you when I had the chance "

" "
"Daphne: No, really. I've never had a serious boyfriend. No-one's really been interested. "
"Niles: Men can be such pigs. [starts making a swan out of the napkins Daphne is sorting out] "
"Daphne: It's not that people weren't trying to fix me up. Back in Manchester my mum was steering me toward Reginald Glower, the butcher’s son. Pasty little thing. Never did take to him. I suppose I like my gents more on the manly side. Was that a little swan you made? "
"Niles: No, it was a B-52. "
"Frasier: Well, Dad's done it again. That was Dr. Jennings’s office on the phone. He's skipped his physical again today. "
"Daphne: Why, that little devil. No wonder he didn't want me to go with him. "
"Niles: Frasier, you know Dad's intense aversion to doctors, you should have seen that he got there. "
"Frasier: Yes, well I didn't see you volunteering this afternoon. "
"Niles: Well, I couldn't. I had my “fear of abandonment” workshop today, and I've already been a no-show twice. "
"Daphne: Wait 'til your father gets here, I'll give him such a piece of my mind. "
"Frasier: If only we had some way of knowing if he was about to arrive. "
"Martin: Hey, how ya doin', boy? Yeah, glad to see you too. "
"Frasier: So. How was your exam today? "
"Martin: Oh, you know. Everything’s pretty routine. "
"Frasier: EKG? "
"Martin: Perfect. "
"Niles: Blood pressure? "
"Martin: Textbook. "
"Frasier: Hope they took a full blood panel. "
"Martin: Oh, yeah. Told them to take two. They're small. "
"Daphne: Ooh, let's have a look. Ooh, look at this. A nice, big Band-Aid. Nice try "
"Martin: Ouch What did you do that for? "
"Daphne: Dr. Jennings's office called to reschedule your appointment. You never showed up today. "
"Niles: Dad, this is ludicrous. Why do you keep avoiding the doctor? "
"Martin: Because I feel fine. I'll go to the doctor when I don't feel fine. Besides, I don't like Dr. Jennings. He's got a model of a colon on his desk, he keeps his tongue depressors in it. "
"Frasier: Well, all right Dad, fine. If you don't like him, why don't you go to see my doctor, she's one of the finest gastroenterologists in this city. "
"Martin: She? Oh ho ho, no no. No way. If a doctor's gonna have me bend over, I want to look through my legs and see wingtips. "
"Daphne: Now now, we'll have none of that. We women have been poked and prodded by male doctors for centuries. I say it's high time you gents went to see a doctor of the opposite sex. See how you like waiting in that room - sitting there all naked and helpless and goose-bumpy. "
"Frasier: Niles, surely you could recommend someone? "
"Frasier: Niles "
"Niles: I'm sorry, my mind was somewhere else. Rec... OH I know who you should see - Dr. Gary Newman. His office is in my building, he has a very successful practice, I saw a Lichtenstein hanging in his office. "
"Frasier: Ooh, Lichtenstein. He sounds perfect. "
"Martin: Alright, alright. I'll make an appointment, I'll go see him. "
"Frasier: Oh, now just hang on a second there, mister. I will make the arrangements and I will escort you personally. "
"Martin: Wonderful. I can't wait. "
"Daphne: Oh, stop grumbling. It won't be so bad. Well, unless you have to parade around the office in one of those gowns where your little bum peeks through the back. "
"Frasier: So Niles, what's Dr. Newman's number? "
"Frasier: ...Niles? NILES "
"Niles: I'm sorry, I must have drifted off again. "
"Martin: My appointment was supposed to be half an hour ago, how much longer are we gonna wait for this guy? Come on Frasier, let's get out of here. "
"Frasier: Dad, Dad, just relax. Read a magazine. Oh, here, here. Take the Cosmo quiz. "
"Martin: 'Are your nipples sensitive?' "
"Frasier: Would you mind doing that quietly, it's not an oral exam. "
"Martin: You haven't seen the second question. Did you used to keep your patients waiting like this? "
"Frasier: Oh, just the compulsives. It was part of their therapy. Relax there, I'll take care of it. "
"Frasier: Yes, my father Martin Crane had an appointment thirty minutes ago? "
"Receptionist: Yes, I'm sorry. The doctor's running a little late this morning, but you'll be first up when he gets in. "
"Frasier: When he gets in? My God, where's he coming from, Spokane? "
"Receptionist: Actually he has a long drive in from his weekend house at Lake Shalonne. "
"Frasier: Lake Shalonne? Ooh, this guy must be terrific "
"Martin: So? "
"Frasier: Dad, relax. He'll be here any minute. You know Dad, I was just struck by one of life's little ironies. I remember you taking me to the doctor, and now here I am taking you. "
"Martin: Yeah. I remember when I took you for your first tetanus shot, you were about five or six. "
"Frasier: Oh boy, was I scared. I remember you holding my hand. "
"Martin: Yeah. Bent over that table, dropped your little drawers. When the nurse gave you the shot, you took your mind off it by reciting the names of all of Puccini's operas. Right then I knew you'd never be a cop. Look, I'm serious. I'm not staying any longer, let's go. "
"Frasier: All right dad, look, I'll check and see if there's someone substituting for him. "
"Martin: What are you here for? "
"Lady: Lately I've been having this overall sluggish feeling. It's hard even getting out of bed in the morning. Not to mention the cold weather. It's really making my joints hurt. I've started to notice flaking spots on my skin. What about you? "
"Martin: I have sensitive nipples. "
"Frasier: Dad? I'm afraid the doctor won't be able to make your appointment today. "
"Martin: Oh, that's just great. These big-shot doctors, they keep you waiting for an hour and then they don't even have the decency to show up What, play a little slow on the golf course today? That arrogant, inconsiderate jerk "
"Frasier: Dad, Dad, Dad – Dr. Newman is dead. He died an hour ago. "
"Martin: I'm sure he was a good man. "
"TO: "
"Frasier: I mean, there he was, walking down his walkway this morning and, he bends over to pick up his newspaper and BANG - he drops dead of a heart attack. It's just... God, you know? I pick up my newspaper every day. And the Sunday Times is very heavy, I'm thinking of canceling. "
"Roz: Well? These things happen. "
"Frasier: “These things happen?” Roz, how can you say that? My God, this was not an old man, he was my age. "
"Roz: What am I supposed to say? I guess I don't think of these things like you do. Guess it's because you're forty-one and I'm... not. "
"Frasier: Don't you ever think about you're own mortality? Don't you ever think about dying? "
"Roz: Well, not me dying, but you know what I have thought about lately? I've been dating this older guy, and what if... you know? We were in bed together and he dropped dead? Well, it's not out of the realm of possibility. Sometimes he starts breathing very funny and I don't know if he's having a good time or if I've overexcited him to some dangerous level. "
"Frasier: Someone certainly has a very high opinion of herself. "
"Roz: Everybody's good at something. "
"Frasier: Why is it that every time we try to have a serious discussion, we end up talking about your sex life? "
"Roz: Because I have one. "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Niles, thank you so much for coming at such short notice. "
"Niles: Hello Dad, Daphne. "
"Daphne: Hello, Dr. Crane. "
"Niles: Yes, I came as soon as I could. I was in the middle of my workout, but, I can always pump iron later. "
"Daphne: Well, I'll just pop into the kitchen and fix us a snack. "
"Frasier: Pump iron? Niles, you don't even pump your own gas. "
"Niles: All right, all right. Now what is all this nonsense about getting your affairs in order? "
"Frasier: Well, it's "
"this: Dr. Newman dying at such a young age really threw me for a loop. I was trying to figure out why, and I finally realized that I hadn't made the proper provisions for my own death. "
"Daphne: Here we go. "
"Niles: Oh Here, allow me. "
"Frasier: First, the pertinent information. I've prepared copies for each of you. The location and numbers of my bank accounts; my safety deposit keys; the number for my attorney... Niles, what are you doing? Oh, give me that "
"Niles: I loosened it for him. "
"Frasier: Now, the distribution of my personal possessions. "
"Daphne: Oh, I really think this is a matter for family only. "
"Frasier: No, no Daphne, please, I'd like you to stay. I'll come to you later. Dad, Niles, I'd like you to put your names on these stickers, and place them on any object you'd like bequeathed to you. "
"Martin: This is crazy. I'm not going to start putting my name on your stuff. "
"Frasier: Dad, what happens if I die tomorrow, you and Niles end up in an argument about... well, that African mask, for instance? "
"Martin: It'll never happen. Niles, you can have it. "
"Niles: I don't want it. "
"Daphne: Well, don't look at me. I throw a towel over that thing when you're not home. "
"Frasier: Okay, fine. Now we come to the issue of... my remains. "
"Martin: Oh, jeez. "
"Frasier: I've arranged every detail in this easy-to-read binder. [gives binder to Martin] "
"Martin: Oh, this is taking it too far, would you look at this? “Burial; Casket; Caterers”? "
"Niles: Who are you using? "
"Frasier: Michaelson's. "
"Niles: Oh, they're very good. Excellent. "
"Martin: Excuse me. Excuse me Are we about done? "
"Frasier: Well, there is just one more duck to put in the row. I've done some research and I've discovered that most unexpected deaths occur in the home. And Daphne, this is where you come in, the actual finding of the body. "
"Daphne: Ooh, save the best part for me, eh? Well, that's all right. I'm a health care provider. I've had my fair share of patients Die on me. "
"Martin: That's a comfort. "
"Frasier: Well, perhaps dad's right. Maybe we should just drop the subject. Well, thank you. This meeting has actually made me feel better, I think I can handle my mortality a bit better now. Well, enough talk about death. [produces a bottle of wine] Let's celebrate life with a bottle of Chateau Certair '75 "
"Niles: Oh no, not the '75, I can't let you do that, that's far too good for the likes of us. "
"Frasier: Well, perhaps a bottle of Beaujolais Nouveau would be more appropriate. "
"Martin: Eddie? Ah, there you are. Come on, boy. Frasier, what are you still doing up? Frasier "
"Frasier: Dad, please, shh. I'm trying to listen to my heartbeat. Amazing thing, the human heart. You know, it can pump eighteen hundred gallons of blood through it each and every day, but the tiniest tear in the tiniest part of the tiniest artery and “poof,” you're gone. "
"Martin: I thought you were all okay about this stuff now. "
"Frasier: Oh, so did I. What is the matter with me? I guess I thought that putting my affairs in order would help me to deal with this thing, but it hasn't. I... I can't seem to get over the feeling that no matter how remote the possibility, something could happen to me. Jeez, I'd miss so much. I'd never get to see my son hit his first home run. It'd be a terrible thing for a father to miss. "
"Martin: Tell me about it. Look son, let me tell you something. There was this time, a while back, seven or eight of us were on this drug bust. We get the order to go through the front door, and the first guy took one. He was dead before he hit the ground. When you're a cop, you've got to be able to handle things like that, but I... I just couldn't get over it. Every time I had to go in a blind alley, or in a dark building, I just froze. And I knew if I kept being afraid to die, I'd never be able to do my job. "
"Frasier: So what did you do? "
"Martin: I just forced myself to forget about it. "
"Frasier: Just like that? "
"Martin: Just like that. Next time I came across one of those doors, I went right through it. The fact that I got shot in the hip was purely coincidental. "
"Frasier: You were this close to helping me there, Dad. "
"Martin: Look Frasier, just because some doctor dies doesn't mean you're gonna die. "
"Frasier: Yes, but he was just like me. Highly educated, sophisticated, at the top of his profession; I saw a picture of him in a medical journal, he even looked like me. Same determined chin, sweater vest and ever-so-slightly receding hairline. "
"Martin: Look, what do you know about this guy? You don't even know his medical history. "
"Frasier: Actually, you're on to something there, dad. Yeah, yeah. For all I know he could have had high blood pressure, popped pills, drank like a fish... "
"Martin: There you go, it could have been any of those things. "
"Frasier: I'm gonna find out what caused his heart attack. That's the only way I can disassociate myself from him. There's got to be some reasonable explanation. That's great, dad. Actually, I do feel better now. "
"Martin: Frasier, you've got something on your bathrobe. "
"Frasier: Niles... the vultures are circling. "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Hello? Hello. I called earlier, someone said Mrs. Newman would be here? "
"Allen: Oh, of course, please come in. I'm Allen Freedman. Gary was my cousin. "
"Frasier: Dr. Frasier Crane. My sincerest condolences. So, I didn't think Mrs. Newman would have company. "
"Allen: Oh, the family are sitting Shiva. "
"Frasier: Excuse me? "
"Allen: You're not Jewish, are you? It's our version of a wake. "
"Frasier: Oh – oh, yes. Oh, of course, of course. I didn't realize that Gary was Jewish, you see. "
"Allen: You're kidding. "
"Frasier: Uh, well no. Ah, well, you know, we were pretty close friends, spent a lot of time together – well, never on Friday nights, of course - but ah, you know, maybe I should come back another time. "
"Allen: No no, please. I'm sure Julie'd love to know that you came. She's right over there. "
"Frasier: Oh, she looks busy. I can wait. "
"Allen: Of course. If you'll excuse me? "
"Bobbie: May I help you? "
"Frasier: Ah. I didn't realize this was a mirror, I thought that maybe you were having an unveiling later. "
"Bobbie: You're not Jewish, are you? "
"Frasier: No, no. My, my ex-wife is, though. And, ah, so and thus my son is. Which makes me, ah, sort of... well I guess you could say... No, I'm not Jewish. "
"Bobbie: We always cover mirrors at a Shiva. So those grieving don't have to be concerned with their own appearances. "
"Frasier: Ah. Ah well, you look very nice. "
"Bobbie: Oh, thank you. It's been driving me crazy. I'm Bobbie, Gary's aunt. "
"Frasier: Dr. Frasier Crane. My deepest sympathies. "
"Bobbie: You're the doctor with the radio show, aren't you? "
"Frasier: Yes, yes. "
"Bobbie: Did you know Gary well? "
"Frasier: Well, yes. Yes, yes I did. Well I, there's so much more I wanted to know about the man. You see, ah... well oh, I don't know, ah... how was his health before he died? "
"Bobbie: Excellent. He was never sick. "
"Frasier: History of heart disease? "
"Bobbie: Oh, no. "
"Frasier: High blood pressure? "
"Bobbie: No. "
"Frasier: High cholesterol? "
"Bobbie: No. "
"Frasier: Do you know what his HDL was in comparison to his LDL? "
"Bobbie: No. "
"Frasier: I'm sorry. I'm asking too many questions. You know how doctors are, always looking for the answers to the mysteries of life. "
"Bobbie: Oh, Gail. "
"Gail: Aunt Bobbie. "
"Bobbie: I know, I know. Gail, I'd like you to meet a friend of Gary's. Dr. Frasier Crane. "
"Gail: Dr. Crane? From the radio? "
"Frasier: Yes. I'm sorry for your loss. "
"Gail: I love your show. Oh, I... I'm sorry about this. It's just, ah, when I went to pick up this linseed tort I thought of Gary and... "
"Frasier: Oh? So Gary had a fondness for fattening desserts, did he? "
"Gail: Oh. You didn't know Gary very well, did you? If he knew I brought this here, he'd kill me. "
"Allen: Yeah, Gary was a total health fanatic, a strict vegetarian. I used to play basketball with him every Sunday. "
"Frasier: Oh. Oh, so he was sedentary all week, then he was burning up the court on Sundays. Well, that can be very straining on the heart, you know... "
"Bobbie: No, he played at least four times a week. That is, when he wasn't at the gym working out. "
"Gail: Gary was in phenomenal shape. "
"Bobbie: He didn't smoke, never touched caffeine... "
"Allen: Did you know he had less than 10 percent body fat on him? "
"Frasier: My goodness. Has anybody checked to see if he's really dead? I'm sure they did check, those people are very thorough. Oh my, is that Krugle? Excuse me. "
"Frasier: I'm Dr Frasier Crane, I was a friend of your husband’s. "
"Newman: Dr. Crane? From...? "
"Frasier: Yes, the radio. "
"Newman: Gary never mentioned you. "
"Frasier: Well, we weren't actually friends. He had an office in my brother’s building. "
"Newman: And you took the time to come down here. His own partner didn't even stay fifteen minutes. That's really sweet of you. "
"Frasier: Well, actually I... there's a reason I came to talk with you. "
"Newman: Which is? "
"Frasier: It's about Gary. About how he, er... "
"Newman: Yes? "
"Frasier: Look, I'm sorry I've bothered you. Ah, I really just came to offer my sympathies. "
"Newman: Oh no, wait. Um, Dr. Crane? I listen to you all the time, and uh – well, maybe you can help me? What would you tell someone who called into the show and said they can't get over why someone died? I keep running this over and over in my mind and... I just can't understand how someone like Gary, who did everything right, can just die. I can't make any sense of it. "
"Frasier: Mrs. Newman, I... I know you'd like me to come up with some grand answer to this whole thing. But I, I don't have one. There are none. Someone who consumes nothing but cigarettes and cheeseburgers all his life can live to be eighty-three, and someone who takes care of himself can die at forty-one. It's unfair. Believe me, there's no explanation for it. Believe me, I've checked. But, I suppose the best we can do is live for the little joys and surprises life affords us. You can't spend your life being obsessed with death. "
"Newman: You're not Jewish, are you? "
"Frasier: No. No I'm not. Well, thank you for letting me be here today. "
"Newman: Oh, thank you for coming, Dr. Crane. "
"Bobbie: Oh, Dr. Crane? It was very nice what you said about living life for the little joys and surprises it can give us. "
"Frasier: Yes. "
"Bobbie: Thank you. "
"Frasier: If only I believed it myself. "
"Woman: Excuse me? Um, this is clearly the most inappropriate thing I've ever done in my life, but... I was watching you, and um, I don't know if I'll ever get the chance to see you again, and something about you tells me that I'd like to. Here. [gives him her card] If you'd like to get together sometime, give me a call. "

"A: KACL Radio Station. "
"Frasier: Well, I'd like to take this opportunity to wish you The very, very best of holidays. Like many of you, I'll be spending the time in the loving embrace of my family - which should give us all plenty to talk about in the new year. Meanwhile, this is Dr. Frasier Crane, KACL 780, Talk Radio. "
"Roz: Come on, Frasier. There's a gin-and-tonic out there with my name on it. "
"Bulldog: You can tell Father Mike's had a few. He's trying to get everyone to re-enact the Nativity scene. "
"Roz: Well, we know who we could get to be the ass. "
"Bulldog: I'm wearing her down. "
"Bulldog: Who's that for? "
"Frasier: It's for Roz. "
"Bulldog: “Amazing trick microphone, squirts water.” Nice. "
"Frasier: It's a gag. We agreed not to exchange gifts. "
"Bulldog: Listen doc. I'm scheduled to do the noon-to-four on Christmas. "
"Frasier: No. "
"Bulldog: But doc, my whole family's getting together in Chicago for the first time in five years. "
"Frasier: I am touched, and I don't care. "
"Bulldog: But my-my-my sister and her new baby... "
"Frasier: Listen Bulldog, my son Frederick is flying in tomorrow afternoon to spend the holidays with me. Now, I've never looked so forward to a Christmas since I was... well, your size. "
"Dave: DID YOU TELL HIM YET, BULLDOG? "
"Bulldog: Okay, you don't have to yell. You're not in the chopper giving us a traffic report. "
"Dave: I WAS YELLING? "
"Bulldog: Hey, doc. You know, ah, Bonnie Weems, right? "
"Frasier: Well, ah, I don't actually know her, but she does the auto show, right? "
"Dave: RIGHT. Bonnie tends to drink a little more than she should at these parties, so the newest on-air personality always drives her home "
"Bulldog: That's you, rookie. "
"Frasier: Well, that sounds like a good tradition, I'd be delighted to drive her home. "
"Bulldog: And she'll be delighted to hear that. "
"Elizabeth: Merry Christmas, Dr. Crane. "
"Frasier: Oh, Merry Christmas, Elizabeth. "
"Elizabeth: I baked you some sugar cookies. "
"Frasier: Oh, how sweet of you. Sweets from the sweet. "
"Elizabeth: Would you by any chance know who's driving Bonnie Weems home tonight? "
"Frasier: Yes, I am. And maybe you can tell me why everyone... "
"Elizabeth: Hey, everybody It's the doc "
"Frasier: Roz, would you mind telling me why everyone breaks into hysterics whenever I say I'm driving Bonnie Weems home... Oh, what is that? "
"Roz: Well, Bonnie Weems is kind of an office legend. She gets a couple of drinks under her belt, and she gets a little amorous. And she will not take “No” for an answer. "
"Frasier: Is that all? Oh, I'm a big boy, I can take care of myself. "
"Roz: Okay. "
"Frasier: Now, listen Roz, Roz, now I know we promised not to, but I couldn't help it. I was out shopping, and... "
"Roz: Oh, no Don't worry, Frasier, I couldn't help myself either. "
"Frasier: Oh no, really? "
"Roz: Yes. Merry Christmas "
"Frasier: Oh Roz, you shouldn't have. This is just... "
"Frasier: Oh, Roz. Roz, you really shouldn't have. "
"Roz: Now it's my turn. "
"Frasier: Oh, no-no-no. Maybe, you know, maybe you should just think about, ah... keeping it under the tree. "
"Roz: Oh, me wait to open a Christmas present? "
"Frasier: Yeah. "
"Roz: Oh my god It's great It's great because I'm in radio "
"Frasier: Ah, that's what I was going for, yes. "
"Roz: Well, thanks a million, Frasier. Have a happy, happy holiday and I'll see you next week. "
"Frasier: Okay. Merry Christmas. "
"Roz: Merry Christmas. "
"Bonnie: Dr. Crane? "
"Frasier: Yes? "
"Bonnie: I'm Bonnie Weems. "
"Frasier: Well, hello. It's a, uh, a pleasure to meet you. I'll be driving you home tonight. "
"Bonnie: I'm sorry to put you out. "
"Frasier: Oh, it's no problem at all. Tell you what, you just go, enjoy the party, you let me know when you're ready to go. "
"Bonnie: I'm ready now, baby. "
"B: Frasier's Apartment. "
"Niles: Hello, Frasier. "
"Frasier: Oh, hello Niles. Merry Christmas. To what do I owe this occasion? "
"Niles: Oh, nothing. Just stopped by to get an opinion on a gift I was considering for Maris. "
"Daphne: Well, it pinches a bit under the arms, but you be the judge. Oh, hello, Dr. Crane. "
"Frasier: Daphne. "
"Daphne: Shall I put the little red one back on so you can Make your choice? "
"Frasier: I think Niles has all the information he needs, thank you. "
"Daphne: Fair enough. "
"Niles: You know, Maris and Daphne are roughly the same size "
"Frasier: Give or take a foot. "
"Martin: Hey, Frasier. Where've you been? "
"Frasier: Well, after the Christmas party I poured a colleague into a cab, said a quick prayer for the driver, dislodged the wedgie of a lifetime, then went on to do a little bit of last minute shopping. Niles, some sherry? "
"Niles: Ah, thank you. "
"Frasier: You know, Santa is going to be very, very good to Frederick This year. "
"Martin: Oh, by the way, Bulldog called a couple of times. He wanted to know if you'd take his slot on Christmas day. "
"Frasier: I already told him no. How long will that man nag me? [Martin heads towards the door with a cheap, plastic wreath] Dad, what are you doing with that? "
"Martin: I'm gonna hang it on the front door, like I always do. "
"Frasier: But it's plastic. "
"Martin: Well, of course it's plastic. Do you think a real one would've lasted since 1967? "
"Daphne: Here you go. Ooh, I'm glad to be out of that black one – I had to take me undies off just to get the zipper up. "
"Daphne: Oh, dear Let me get that. "
"Martin: Hello. Oh, hi. Frasier, it's for you. It's the nag. "
"Frasier: Oh, lord. Now, listen Bulldog, I already told you... Oh. Hello, Lilith. Well, you know, maybe, ah, I should take this in the bedroom. "
"Martin: Niles? Everything's all set for tomorrow, right? "
"Niles: Yes, yes. Maris and I are driving up to the cabin tonight. We'll expect you, Frasier and Frederick tomorrow around noon. "
"Daphne: Oh, I wish I was coming with you. "
"Niles: So do I. "
"Martin: Oh, Shut the hell up, will you? "
"Niles: Daphne. Daphne, you should come. We have the most wonderful traditional Christmas, it's an actual log cabin. With actual deer grazing in the snow on our front yard. Of course, Maris fires off her shotgun from time to time to scare them away from our garbage, but still, it's enchanting. "
"Martin: Yeah. You sure you can't come, Daph? "
"Daphne: No, I promised my Uncle Jackie I'd fly down to San Francisco to be with him. "
"Martin: Well, I guess you should be with your family at this time of year, it's more traditional. "
"Daphne: Except that Jackie's a transvestite. Getting a bit long in the tooth for it too, if you ask me. Last Thanksgiving he ate too much turkey and I had to cut him out of his pantyhose. "
"Frasier: Well, Merry Christmas, everybody Lilith isn't sending Frederick "
"Martin: What? Why not? "
"Frasier: Well, apparently he has this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for an incredible Christmas. A friend of hers has rented a home in Austria. "
"Martin: What's the matter with the good old U.S.A.? "
"Frasier: Well, apparently it's the same house that they filmed “The Sound Of Music” in, and that happens to be Freddie's favorite movie. Well, Julie Andrews is singing with the Salzburg Choral, they're having dinner with her afterwards, and some nonsense about a horse-driven sleigh ride through the snow, and a toboggan, and a balloon trip through the Alps, and apparently on their way back they're gonna spend an entire day at Euro-Disneyland "
"Niles: ...Well, up at the cabin, there's an old stump that the local children seem to enjoy kicking. "
"Martin: You know you have to let him go, don't you? "
"Frasier: Well, of course I have to let him go. Thank you for pointing out that you know what's right. "
"Martin: Hey I was just making sure that you did, that's all. "
"Frasier: Oh, how would I ever live without you? "
"Daphne: Now now, boys, that's enough. Dr. Crane, you're being a good father, letting Frederick go. "
"Niles: That's right. It doesn't have to ruin your Christmas. "
"Martin: Yeah, come on. Let's finish decorating the Christmas tree. I brought up the good lights from the storage room. "
"Frasier: Oh, dad, you know what, I don't want to use those lights this year. I picked up these just yesterday. [brings out a box of lights] "
"Martin: Chili peppers? "
"Frasier: Well, yes, they're very fashionable. "
"Martin: Chili peppers aren't Christmas. "
"Frasier: Well, for that matter, neither are scotch pines or snow ornaments. For God's sakes, if you want to be technical, Bethlehem was in the desert. "
"Martin: Fine. Why don't we decorate a palm tree? "
"Frasier: I don't need your sarcasm. "
"Martin: But I always use those lights. "
"Frasier: Dad, dad. This is my house, these are my decorations, just once, could I have just one thing I wanted this Christmas? "
"Martin: Hey, look. Wait a minute. I know you're upset about Freddie, but don't take it out on me. "
"Frasier: Oh fine. Now you're the psychiatrist? "
"Martin: Oh, I give up. Go ahead, decorate the thing. Use your chili peppers "
"Frasier: All right, I won't anymore "
"Martin: Use 'em Why don't... maybe we could hang a few radishes, put a nice broccoli on top "
"Niles: I hope you two aren't going to be behaving this way up at the cabin? "
"Frasier: Oh, we won't Because I'm not going to the cabin "
"Martin: What do you mean, you're not going to the cabin? Where the hell are you going? "
"Frasier: I'm staying right here. "
"Martin: Well, you can't stay alone on Christmas. [by this time, Eddie Has his head under a cushion] "
"Frasier: I've decided to fill in for Bulldog At least somebody will have a Merry Christmas "
"Martin: Well, Merry Christmas "
"Frasier: MERRY CHRISTMAS "
"Martin: MERRY CHRISTMAS "
"Frasier: MERRY CHRISTMAS "
"A: Radio Station. "
"Frasier: Oh, Roz... I didn’t realize when I volunteered to work on Christmas that I would ruin your plans for the day, I... please don't be mad. "
"Roz: Mad? What for? My mother just flew all the way in from Wisconsin to be here with me today. But instead I'm back in this stinking hellhole on Christmas Day, when only the loneliest and most depressed people on the planet would EVER call in. But, look how nice you made yourself look for me "
"Frasier: Roz, try to see this thing from my position. I, I couldn't see my son, I had a terrible fight with my father, I was facing a horrible Christmas, and then I thought, you know, maybe if by trying to help other people through their troubles it might get me through mine, and I think if we really try hard, we can maybe have the best Christmas we've ever had. What do you say? "
"Roz: Okay. I'm not mad. Get ready. "
"Frasier: Oh, I need a hug, just to prove that we're still friends. "
"Roz: Frasier, I am not hugging you. "
"Frasier: Come on. "
"Roz: No, you're grungy. "
"Frasier: Come to papa. "
"Roz: All right We're friends. Now get ready, we're on. "
"Frasier: Merry Christmas, Seattle Yes, this is Dr. Frasier Crane coming to you on Christmas Day. Christmas, that very magical time of the year, when each moment is as unique as a snowflake, never to be recreated. "
"Roz: I'm sorry Frasier, the news went over you. You're gonna have to do that again. "
"Frasier: Merry Christmas, Seattle... "
"TO: Later "
"Frasier: Well, as we head into our second hour, I'd like to lighten things up a bit. Although, Ned, we were certainly glad to hear from you, and how you got mugged on your way home from the soup kitchen. Roz, who's next? "
"Roz: We have Don on line five, he wants to tell us about the time he was filled with the Christmas spirit. "
"Frasier: It's about time Hello, Don. "
"Don: Hello, Dr. Crane. Something happened the other day that sums up why we call this the season of giving. "
"Frasier: Well then, swaddle me in Christmas cheer. "
"Don: Okay. Well, you see, I was driving home from the gym, and I suddenly realized I had left my favorite old pair of sneakers on the roof of the car. So, I look back and there's this homeless guy, and he'd already picked them up, and he's putting 'em on. So I just thought, what the hell, and kept on driving. "
"Frasier: So your experience of the Christmas spirit would be that you didn't slam the car into reverse, speed back there, and rip a pair of smelly old sneakers out of a homeless man's hand? Well Roz, this is special, I think we've got Santa Claus himself on the line "
"TO: Later "
"Barry: I'm sorry. That was the last time. I'm okay now, I'm okay. No, I'm not "
"Frasier: Barry, I've got to put you on hold for a bit, while you pull yourself together, but please, please stay on the line, I'd really like to help you. "
"Barry: It's alright, I think I've got a hold of myself... [starts crying again] "
"TO: Later "
"Gladys: So you see, Dr. Crane, I've fallen in the shower so many times, they can't fit any more pins in my hip. "
"Frasier: Gladys, Gladys? Ah, listen, can I put you on hold for a second? There's somebody else I have to check on. [switches lines] How's it going there, Barry? "
"Frasier: My sentiments exactly. "
"TO: Later "
"Tom: It still traumatizes me, Dr. Crane. I wake up nights, and I remember that Christmas morning. I walked into my mother’s bedroom, tears running down my face, and I said, “Mommy... the puppy Santa gave me won't wake up.” "
"Frasier: Okay, Tom. You win the prize for the saddest Christmas story we've heard today. Happy holidays. "
"Frasier: Roz? Roz Oh, have you been crying, Roz? "
"Roz: Just for the last hour. "
"Frasier: Ooh... oh, listen, why don't you just go home, honey? I can take over for the next two hours. "
"Roz: But you can't do this on your own. "
"Frasier: Oh, sure I can Why don't you go home, be with your mom? "
"Roz: Wouldn't it be even be sadder? With you here all by yourself? "
"Frasier: I don't think that's possible. "
"Roz: Well, if you really mean it, I'll go. "
"Frasier: I mean it. "
"Roz: But Frasier, promise me one thing? Don't sit here and get more depressed. You'll see your little boy again soon. "
"Frasier: I know I will. "
"Roz: Okay. Hug-hug-hug? Merry... [bursts into tears again] Christmas "
"Frasier: Hi, we're back. Well, you know what? I, I realize it's been a pretty tough day out there for most of you, and uh, I'd like to hear now from someone who's having a GOOD Christmas. Um, you know, someone who's learned a way to beat the holiday blues. Well, let's take our first call here. Hello, you're on the air. "
"Jeff: This is Jeff. "
"Frasier: Hello, Jeff Well, Merry Christmas "
"Jeff: Well, Merry Christmas to you. I used to get depressed on Christmas. And then I found a surefire way to beat "
"it: I'd pop my favorite movie, “The Sound Of Music” in the VCR. Watching Julie Andrews lead those adorable little tykes through the streets of Salzburg... Nobody could be depressed I mean, nobody "
"Frasier: Jeff, are you a betting man? "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Well, we're just about out of time. My, my, this day has flown by. I'd like to wish all of you revelers out there a Merry Christmas, and for the rest of you, why don't you go out and treat yourself to something special? Personally, I'm going to go get myself a meal at one of Seattle's fine eateries. I don't know where, but I promise you one "
"thing: it'll have a liquor license. Just kidding. Don't drink and drive. This is Dr. Frasier Crane, KACL 780, Talk Radio. "
"B: A Diner. "
"Waitress: Merry Christmas. Welcome to Lou's. "
"Frasier: Thank you. I'm sure glad you're open, all the other places in town are either closed or are all booked up. "
"Waitress: That's what makes us so special. I can bring you a menu, but almost everybody's having the Christmas platter. That's a turkey log with mashed potatoes, then yule log for dessert. "
"Frasier: How much more appetizing food always becomes when you add the word “log.” I'll just have the Christmas platter. "
"Waitress: PLATTER "
"Tim: How you doin'? "
"Frasier: Okay. "
"Tim: Are you havin' a merry Christmas? "
"Frasier: Well, now that you ask, no I'm not. Can't be with my son, had a terrible argument over something stupid with my father. That's why I'm alone. How about you? "
"Tim: Pretty good, actually. Just yesterday, I was crossing the street, and this beautiful pair of sneakers flew off the back of the car, and landed on my feet "
"Frasier: Merry Christmas. "
"Waitress: Here you go. "
"Frasier: Well, the chef didn't exactly dally over the Remoulade, did he? "
"TO: "
"Bill: Hey, Tim. Merry Christmas. "
"Tim: Hey Bill, same to you. Glad you could make it. "
"Bill: Well, I wouldn't miss this. Hey, how's that turkey platter? Good as last year's? "
"Frasier: I'm not sure this isn't last year's. Listen, I'm done here, why don't you go ahead and take this seat? "
"Bill: Jeez, thanks pal. "
"Frasier: You bet. "
"Frasier: Ah, excuse me miss, something rather embarrassing has just happened. I seem to have lost my wallet. "
"Waitress: You mean you can't pay "
"Frasier: Oh no, I can pay, I can pay, I must have just left it at the office. "
"Waitress: Uh-huh. "
"Frasier: Well, I can just go back there and get it. "
"Waitress: Mmm. "
"Tim: Hey, Lou. It's all right. This one's on me. "
"Frasier: Oh, no-no-no. You don't understand. You see, I... "
"Tim: It's okay, buddy, we've all been there. "
"Frasier: Yes, but you see, I really did misplace my wallet. "
"Tim: I know you did, and Bill here misplaced his Wall Street portfolio. Here Bill, help me out. "
"Frasier: Oh no, you don't... "
"Tim: Hey, everybody People. Come on, let's help the poor man get a nice Christmas dinner. Even pennies. It doesn't matter. "
"Frasier: Please, please, you don't understand. I make a very decent living. I really do. This is not necessary. "
"Frasier: Well, I must say I've never been so touched in my life. To think that you people would give up your money, which you can ill afford, to help out a fellow human being. I'm just so embarrassed. "
"Tim: Don't be embarrassed. Look at it this "
"way: the rest of the year belongs to the rich people, with their fancy houses, expensive foreign cars, but Christmas? Christmas belongs to guys like us. "
"Frasier: Right. Well, I never will forget this Christmas. Thank you. Thank you all. "
"Waitress: Hey. Somebody lose a set of car keys? "
"Tim: Hey. We're not buying you dessert. "
"Frasier: No. No, you see, I forgot... I forgot, ah... "
"Frasier: To wish you a Merry Christmas "
"All: Merry Christmas. "
"Tim: Hey, bud. Since you're here, go call your old man. "
"Frasier: Thank you. I think I will. "

"Frasier: ...and though washing one's hands twenty to thirty times a day would be considered obsessive/compulsive, please bear in mind that your husband is a coroner. Thank you for your call, Jeanine. Roz, whom do we have next? "
"Roz: We have Ethan on line three, and he's having a little problem at school. "
"Frasier: Hello, Ethan. I'm listening. "
"Ethan: Hi, Dr. Crane. "
"Frasier: How old are you? "
"Ethan: I'm thirteen. "
"Frasier: Ah well, what can I do for you? "
"Ethan: Well, I'm having a lot of problems with the other kids at school. They're always beating me up. "
"Frasier: Why do you think that's so? "
"Ethan: Probably because I'm smart. I have a 160 IQ. I'm in the astronomy club and I hate sports. "
"Frasier: Well, you know, Ethan, the other children are just acting out of jealousy and immaturity, and I... I know it doesn't help much right now, but the day will come in the next few years when you will have the last laugh. "
"Ethan: ...That's it? "
"Frasier: Yes. "
"Ethan: Frankly, Dr. Crane, I find that advice patronizing, simplistic and, in all candor, uninspired. The real surprise here is that they pay you to dole out this balloon juice. "
"Frasier: Ethan, where are you calling from? "
"Ethan: Home. "
"Frasier: Well, if any of Ethan's classmates are listening, you know where he is, and he can't stay in there forever. "
"Frasier: Well, that's about it for today. This is Frasier Crane, KACL Talk Radio, 780 AM. "
"Frasier: Well Roz, I thought that was a pretty good show, didn't you? "
"Roz: Yeah, sure. Whatever you say. "
"Frasier: You seem a bit distracted there, Roz. You got another one of your hot dates? "
"Roz: If you must know, yes. "
"Noel: Pick you up outside in five minutes? "
"Roz: Great. Thanks, Noel. "
"Frasier: Noel? Noel Shempsky from Sales, that's who your date's with? "
"Roz: Well, it's not a date. We're just going out for a drink, okay? "
"Frasier: Noel the Mole? "
"Roz: I know, he's not great-looking. I know he drives a '73 Dodge Polaris. But he's always struck me as a really interesting guy. "
"Frasier: Mm-hmm... "
"Roz: Look, the world is loaded with superficial guys. You know, I just want to go out with someone who has a good heart. He's smart. He's substantial - and you know, considering my track record lately I would hope you'd support me. Is that asking too much? "
"Frasier: Does Noel still have that autographed picture of Captain Kirk in his cubicle? "
"Roz: Why do I tell you anything? "
"B: Frasier's Apartment, kitchen. "
"Niles: Knock, knock. Can I be of any assistance? "
"Daphne: Oh, no thank you, Dr. Crane, I think I have everything under control. "
"Niles: Do you mind if I linger then? I've always been sort of a kitchen person. "
"Daphne: Suit yourself. I like the company. "
"Niles: How's dad’s therapy going? "
"Daphne: Well, we're getting more mobility in his hip, and his flexibility's improving, but it's always a chore to get him to do his exercises. Of course, I've found the secret is if I bribe him with sweets... "
"Daphne: Oh my goodness "
"Daphne: Dr. Crane Dr. Crane, can you get up? "
"Niles: No. No, I think I'd better stay here for a few minutes. "
"Frasier: Dear God, I thought I heard... Niles, what are you doing? "
"Daphne: I'm afraid he conked his head, on the hood there. "
"Frasier: You are shameless "
"Niles: Frasier, I have a very sore head and a crackerjack lawyer, so don't crowd me. "
"Daphne: Here. Put this on it. "
"Niles: Oh, thank you, Daphne. You've been wonderful in this time of crisis. "
"Frasier: Oh, come on, Camille "
"Frasier: I need to talk to you. Here, have a seat, right here. Now listen Niles, I'm having a young lady over on Friday night, I was hoping you could take Dad out for me. "
"Niles: Oh, I wish you'd said Saturday. "
"Frasier: Why, you have plans Friday? "
"Niles: No, I have plans Saturday. "
"Frasier: Niles, just tell me that you'll do this for me? "
"Niles: Oh, all right. "
"Frasier: Thank you. "
"Niles: So... does this mean you're hoping to get lucky Friday night? "
"Frasier: Oh Niles, please. Nobody refers to having sex as “getting lucky” anymore. "
"Niles: I do. "
"Martin: Hello, boys. "
"Niles: Hey, Dad. "
"Frasier: Hi, Dad. "
"Niles: Dad? I was wondering if you'd be interested in joining Maris and me Friday night. We're dying to try the new rib joint that's opened on Bellevue Way. I understand if the onion rings aren't as big as your head you get them for free. "
"Martin: Well thanks, Niles, but I thought I'd spend a quiet evening at home. "
"Niles: Oh, well then... Better yet, why don't you come to our house? We'll make dinner, and we'll even rent an Angie Dickinson film. "
"Frasier: Ooh "
"Martin: All right, what's going on? Frasier wants me out of here because he has a date or something? "
"Niles: I'm sorry, Frasier, he sees things that others don't. "
"Frasier: Well, I'm sorry, Dad. I guess I should have asked you myself. "
"Martin: Oh, that's all right. Yeah, I'll clear out. But just remember, one hand washes the other around here. "
"Frasier: What does that mean? "
"Martin: Well, as long as I'm clearing out for you Friday night, you can clear out for me Thursday night. I've got a date with Elaine Morris from 14-12. "
"Frasier: Oh Well, well. How long has this been going on? "
"Martin: Oh, she's had me over for coffee a couple of times. Just thought I'd like to have her over here for dinner. [without looking back] Niles, wipe that stupid smirk off your face. What do you say, Frasier? "
"Frasier: Well, sure Dad. I think that's terrific. Oh listen, if there's a lull in the conversation, we’ve got all kind of board games back here in the closet, we got playing cards - does she like to play Canasta? "
"Niles: Oh - and PBS is running a wonderful documentary on the swing bands of the 30's and 40's. "
"Frasier: Ooh, wow... "
"Martin: Well, thanks a lot for all your help, boys, but I think we'll just split a bowl of creamed corn, rub a little liniment into each other’s joints and fall asleep drooling on the couch "
"TO: "
"C: Frasier's Apartment, Kitchen. "
"Frasier: Morning, Daphne. "
"Daphne: Good morning, Dr. Crane. I want to thank you again for the show last night. I've never been to experimental theatre before. "
"Frasier: Don't mention it. It was my pleasure. "
"Daphne: Well, I think I understood most of it. Only what did it mean when the naked man came in, carrying a suitcase? "
"Frasier: I think it meant that he's packed too much. "
"Daphne: Well, I'm sure your father appreciated having us out of the house. "
"Frasier: What is that heavenly aroma? "
"Daphne: I decided to prepare us a traditional English breakfast. We have eggs, bangers - or as you call them, sausages – and to finish it off... "
"Daphne: A batch of Grammy Moon's famous sticky buns "
"Frasier: Oh my, that's it "
"Daphne: Grammy made these every Sunday. 'Course, she added a pint of rum to the recipe. And nobody liked these more than Grammy herself. Many's the Sunday I'd head over to her house after church, only to find her out in the garden in her wedding dress, facedown in the birdbath. "
"Martin: Morning. "
"Frasier: Morning, dad. So... How was your date last night, huh? Ha, boy, feels strange, you know? A son asking his father how his date was last night... "
"Frasier: When he could ask the date herself "
"Martin: Elaine, this is Daphne Moon, my son Frasier Crane, Elaine Morris. "
"Frasier: So... so, it's a pleasure to meet you, Elaine. It's ah... I know that dad's wanted to have you for a long time - I mean, for dinner "
"Elaine: Yes. Well, I certainly enjoyed it. But you know, Martin, I... I really should be going. "
"Martin: Oh no, no. You should at least stay for breakfast, shouldn't she, Fras? "
"Frasier: Oh yes, absolutely. "
"Elaine: Well, I guess I could stay for coffee. "
"Frasier: Splendid, splendid, splendid. So uh – so uh... what did you two kids do last night? Did you ah, play some games? Well, I mean, board games Not that you were bored - or excited... well, not that I'd know anything - or should But ah... warm buns, Elaine? No, no, not yours I mean ours, ours [picks up Daphne's sticky buns] To eat, you see. Have one, I'll have one Warm "
"Martin: Why don't we go sit at the table? "
"Elaine: Okay... "
"Martin: What the hell's wrong with you? "
"Frasier: I don't know "
"Elaine: Well, uh... Frasier, you know, I really love your radio show. My friends and I listen to it almost every day. "
"Frasier: Thank you. That's always lovely to hear. "
"Martin: Elaine's a buyer at Beaumarchais. "
"Frasier: Oh really, really? I do-do a great deal of shopping there. As a matter of fact, I bought the comforter on dad’s bed there, and, well, I supposed you noticed that... maybe you didn't - I mean, I don't know if you had the lights on, or... I mean, I don't know how you like it... I mean, how you... light it How you like to light it "
"Frasier: Oh, banger, dad? "
"Elaine: You know, I really should be going, I've got to get ready for work, it was nice meeting you Daphne, and uh, Frasier. Thanks for a lovely evening, Martin. "
"Martin: I'll call you later. "
"Elaine: Yeah. "
"Frasier: You couldn't have served bacon? "
"Daphne: Me? The way you were carrying on, I think we can be thankful I didn't make Toad in the Hole "
"Martin: Well, you handled that smoothly, Dr. Crane. "
"Frasier: I'm sorry, dad. It just, really caught me off guard. "
"Martin: Ah, that's ok. I really ought to apologize. I should have warned you, but... I really didn't think it was going to happen. I’m pretty glad it did "
"Frasier: So, you like Elaine? "
"Martin: I like Elaine. "
"Frasier: So, dad... "
"Martin: Yeah, yeah... "
"Frasier: You're back on the beat "
"Martin: All right. "
"Frasier: Lock up your daughters "
"Martin: Okay, okay. "
"Frasier: Oh, come on, you old... "
"Martin: Frasier, don't push it "
"A: Radio Station. "
"Roz: One line one we have Marianne, she's concerned about her daughter. "
"Frasier: Hello Marianne, I'm listening. "
"Marianne: Kids - you can't live with them, you can't shove them back in the womb. "
"Frasier: Well, as we try to forget the image that that summons up, how can I help you, Marianne? "
"Marianne: Well, two days ago, Judy, my twenty-two year old, arrived home for a visit with her boyfriend. I insisted that they sleep in separate bedrooms. She got furious with me, and she's been giving me dirty looks all week. Am I completely out of line here? "
"Frasier: Not at all. I, I think that in your own house you make up the rules. "
"Marianne: Thank you. "
"Frasier: But... are we sure there isn't something else going on here? Perhaps you're having a problem thinking of your daughter as an adult. You see, we all have a tendency to freeze people in roles with which we are most comfortable. Especially when it comes to that old bugaboo, sex. You know, let me use myself as an example. As many of you know, my sixty-three year old father recently moved in with me and, just this morning over coffee, I discovered he had spent the night in his room with a delightful creature named Elaine. The entire episode completely unnerved me. Why? Because I had never thought of my father as a man with normal sexual urges. To me he was always old plain old Dad. Well, that's absurd. My father is a witty, virile, charming man, possessed of the hereditary Crane good looks, and what I suppose I'm driving at is, that sexuality is a healthy part of adulthood, at any age. I think it's time we embrace that, don't you, Marianne? "
"Maryanne: Sorry, Dr. Crane, I gotta go. I'm hearing noises from the guest room. "
"Frasier: Well, as Marianne rushes to the guest room with a bucket of ice water, we will pause for these messages. "
"Roz: Hey Frasier, that was a really good show. "
"Frasier: Oh, thank you. I thought so too. "
"Noel: Hi, Dr Crane. Hi, Roz. "
"Roz: Hi, Noel. "
"Noel: I had a great time last night. "
"Roz: Me, too. "
"Noel: I made you this spice rack. I especially treated The back for easy wall adhesion. "
"Roz: That was very thoughtful of you, Noel. "
"Noel: Well um, I gotta run. I'll call you later. [gives the Vulcan peace salute] Live long and prosper. "
"Frasier: Ooh look, there's a place for cumin, most people overlook that. "
"Roz: Just kill me. "
"B: Frasier's Apartment. "
"Martin: I don't understand it. Why would he say something like that on the radio? "
"Daphne: Did you know, when you get angry your ears turn red? [Martin glares at her] See? There they go. "
"Frasier: Evening, everyone. "
"Daphne: I'll be going to my room right now. "
"Frasier: Hello, Eddie. Well, I seem to have cleared the room. "
"Martin: I want to talk to you, mister. "
"Frasier: Oh, sounds like someone's being taken out behind the woodshed. "
"Martin: Don't tempt me. Where the hell do you get off talking about my personal life on your radio program? "
"Frasier: Are you discussing what I said about you and Elaine? "
"Martin: You're damned right I am. I've never been so embarrassed in my Life. "
"Frasier: But dad, everything I said was flattering. "
"Martin: Oh, yeah. Telling all of Seattle about your old dad shacking up with the neighbor lady. "
"Frasier: Oh, come on you old swordsman, I thought you'd get a kick out of it. "
"Martin: Knock it off, Frasier. Thanks to you Elaine won't even talk to me anymore. "
"Frasier: What for? Just because of a harmless remark I made on the radio? "
"Martin: Hey, for your information, people of our generation think sex is a private thing. And I still think that's a pretty healthy way of looking at it. Sex is something between you, and the person you're doing it to "
"Frasier: Well, don't you think she's overreacting? "
"Martin: Put yourself in her place. She takes a chance and spends the night with me. Next thing she knows, it's being broadcast all over Seattle. I mean, her friends heard it and called her. She's so embarrassed she's never been out of the house all day, she won't even answer the phone now. "
"Frasier: I'm sorry, dad. "
"Martin: Your sympathy touches me "
"Frasier: Well look, look. I caused a problem here, and I will take care of it. "
"Martin: Yeah? Well, I'll be in my room, holding my breath. "
"Frasier: I said I'd take care of it "
"C: Radio Station. "
"Al: I hate my voice. I mean, I know no-one likes the sound of their own voice, especially when they hear it on tape. Because it doesn't sound as good as it does in their own head. But I hate my voice in my head too. "
"Al: And you can't get away from your own voice either, you know. I've tried not listening to myself when I talk. But I find myself kinda saying things that don't make a lot of sense... "
"Al: I hate my voice so much, I had to call a neighbor in to do the message on my answering machine. I don't like his voice very much either, but it's better than mine... "
"Al: Not that I get a lot of calls... "
"Al: Well, you go figure. Any advice, Dr Crane? "
"Frasier: Yes, yes uh, just go on with what you're doing, and everything should turn out all right. Thank you for your call. Now, I'd like to end today’s show on something of a personal note. I'm talking to one person in my audience. Elaine - you wouldn't answer my phone calls, you wouldn't come to the door, so I hope you're listening. And if you are, I want to apologize for what I said on the radio. I took something that was of a private nature and turned it into public knowledge. I promise I will never do that again - well, except for this time, then I promise I'll never do it again. You see, the saddest thing is, Elaine, that uh, that dad is paying for my mistake. "
"Frasier: Elaine... Martin cares for you. And he misses you very much. More than anything in the world, he'd like to be back together with you. And if you feel for him the way he feels for you, I hope you'll find it in your heart to come to my place tonight, at eight o' clock, for dinner. A very romantic dinner. Thanks, Elaine. This is KACL 780 AM, talk radio. And I'm Frasier Crane... the Love Doctor. "
"TO: "
"D: Frasier's Apartment. "
"Frasier: Ah. Well, the champagne's chilled, a platter of hors d'oeuvres, how are things in the kitchen? "
"Daphne: The roast is out of the oven. It looks beautiful. "
"Frasier: God, I hope this works, Daphne. "
"Daphne: Well, I've been sending Elaine psychic messages all day. "
"Frasier: You're kidding. You can transmit? I thought you were just a receiver. "
"Daphne: Well, I'm giving it a try. You know, 'Elaine in 14-10, come to dinner, come to dinner'. "
"Frasier: That's very charming, Daphne, but Elaine's in 14-12. "
"Daphne: Oh dear. I guess I'd better set an extra place at the table, then. "
"Martin: Ah look, it's eight o' clock and I'm still a pumpkin. "
"Frasier: Dad, it is two minutes to eight, and why don't you just sit down and relax? "
"Martin: Oh, this is stupid. She probably didn't even hear your show. Does this tie go with the jacket? "
"Daphne: You look smashing. "
"Martin: Oh, who the hell am I kidding? She's not going to show up. I don't know why I even- "
"Frasier: May I suggest we just skip the first course, which is crow, and move directly to the hors d'oeuvres? "
"Martin: Just shut up and answer the door. "
"Frasier: All right. "
"Marjorie: Excuse me, is this the Crane residence? "
"Frasier: Yes it is. "
"Marjorie: Well, we've been waiting here for the last fifteen minutes. Did Elaine show up, or did we miss her? "
"Frasier: Who are all you people? "
"Woman: We heard your show today. "
"Marjorie: Oh, it was so romantic, we all have our fingers crossed. "
"Frasier: Yes, very kind. "
"Marjorie: I'm Marjorie, from down on eleven... "
"Frasier: Hello, Marjorie. "
"Marjorie: And this is Norman... "
"Frasier: Hello, Norman. It's a pleasure. "
"Marjorie: And the rest of these people I don't know. "
"Frasier: Nice to see you all. Tony? Tony, what are you doing here? For God's sakes, shouldn't you be watching the door? "
"Tony: Oh, don't worry, we're all locked in. I have GOT to find out how this ends, Doc. "
"Martin: What's going on out here? "
"Marjorie: Is that him? "
"Frasier: People, people, please. Don't you have lives of your own? For God's sake, beat it, scoot, scat.. "
"Martin: What's happening? "
"Frasier: This is a private situation here... "
"Frasier: Please, please, come out here. "
"Elaine: No, I'm going home. "
"Frasier: All right then, dad, dad you come in here. [hustles Martin into the lift] All right everybody, back off, just back off Just give us some time, please "
"Elaine: Oh, I knew I should never have come up here, nothing's changed. "
"Frasier: Elaine, please let me try to explain. "
"Martin: You've done enough. "
"Frasier: Oh dad, please, what do you happen to know... "
"Martin: Frasier, over there "
"Frasier: Dad "
"Martin: Turn around "
"Martin: Look Elaine, I'm sorry about what happened. You've got every right to be mad. But I thought what we had was pretty good, and thanks to Radio Boy here, I think most of Seattle agrees with me. I'd sure hate to lose it, just because of one stupid thing. Come on, Elaine. I had a great time on our date the other night. You gonna tell me you don't feel the same way? You may not remember... but I have warm toes. "
"Martin: Anyway, it's your choice, but I sure wish you'd come and have dinner with me. "
"Elaine: Who said you could turn around? "
"Marjorie: Look, it's coming back up "
"Martin: All right, everyone. You've had your fun. Show's over. Nothing more to see. Go back to your homes. "
"Frasier: Yes, please folks. Honor what the man says. Thank you so much for coming. Thank you for your concern. Let's expedite this departure please, if you would. Thank you so much. Goodbye. "
"Daphne: Well, I suppose we should give them their privacy. "
"Frasier: Yes. Yes, I suppose you're right. It's ironic, isn't it? My sixty-three year old father with a bum hip is about to embark on a night of romance, while the two of us, man and woman, both attractive and eligible, and in the prime of our lives, have nothing to do on a Saturday night. "
"Daphne: You know, the answer to our problems may be right under our noses. "
"Frasier: Yes Daphne, I think it is. "
"Daphne: All right. You go claim the washing machines, I'll go get the laundry. "

"Bulldog: ...4 for 17 on Sunday, he calls himself a quarterback? I've passed kidney stones with more accuracy "
"Frasier: Roz, Roz. Listen, could you go in there and get my briefcase for me? I was just on my way out but I left it in the studio. "
"Roz: Why don't you go get it? "
"Frasier: Well, because every time I go in there, he puts me on the air and humiliates me. "
"Roz: Well, what do you think he does to me? Last week when I went in to get my car keys he introduced me as Martina Navratilova's girlfriend. "
"Bulldog: Well Chuck, I'm really sorry I offended you. Now why don't you put your skirt back on and do some dishes? "
"Bulldog: The lines are open. And how about some real men calling instead of crybabies like Chuck? "
"Bulldog: Well... look who's just crawled into the doghouse, it's Dr. Frasier Crane And you know what we always do when we get a house call from the doctor. "
"Tape: Dropp-a your pants and bend over, I take-a your temperature. "
"Frasier: Hello, Bulldog. "
"Bulldog: So, doc? Who's your pick for the Giants- Saints game this weekend? "
"Frasier: The Giants. "
"Bulldog: You're kidding "
"Frasier: The Saints? "
"Bulldog: You're kidding "
"Frasier: Somebody has to win. "
"Bulldog: Yeah. They would if the Giants and Saints were playing this weekend "
"Frasier: Yes, that was very funny indeed. I wished you'd played it on my show. It deserves to be heard by a much larger audience. Hee haw Hee haw "
"B: The Frasier Residence. "
"Daphne: Hello, Dr. Crane. "
"Niles: Hello, Daphne. I brought this for dinner. "
"Martin: Hey, Niles. "
"Niles: Dad. "
"Martin: Kinda early. "
"Niles: Well, I just put Maris on the train to Chicago. And you know how desolate I am without my Maris. "
"Daphne: Champagne? "
"Niles: Goes with all occasions. Can I be of any assistance in the kitchen? "
"Daphne: No, I have everything well in hand. "
"Niles: Ah, well... lucky everything. "
"Niles: Uh-uh. [Martin reaches for another piece] Mmm-mmm. "
"Martin: All right, what would you do? "
"Niles: Well for starters, I'd take that corn-nut off the board. "
"Martin: That corn-nut's my bishop. Eddie ate the real one. "
"Niles: In that case, corn-nut to Rook 7. "
"Frasier: Hello all. "
"Daphne: Evening, Dr. Crane. Guess what your brother brought, champagne. "
"Frasier: Oh, Maris left for Chicago already? "
"Niles: She's riding the rails as we speak. "
"Daphne: If I may ask, why does she take the train? "
"Niles: She's been afraid to fly since her harrowing incident. "
"Daphne: Oh, dear. Did a plane almost crash? "
"Niles: No, no. She was bumped from first class. She still wakes up screaming. "
"Martin: Hey Frasier, I'm glad you're here, I've got a favour to ask you. "
"Frasier: What is it, dad? "
"Martin: Well, you know my old buddy from the force Joe Linski's running the benefit for the Widows and Orphans fund this year, and he's doing one of those bachelor auctions and he's out looking for local celebrities and I thought if we could get somebody really famous from the radio station... "
"Frasier: Dad, say no more. I'd be delighted to help. "
"Martin: Great. So you'll ask Bulldog tomorrow? "
"Frasier: ...Bulldog. "
"Martin: Oh. Well, you know, don't get me wrong, I was going to ask you too. "
"Frasier: Mm-hmm? "
"Martin: Yeah I was, I was. I was just saving the best for last. "
"Frasier: A-ha. "
"Niles: Oh Frasier, give him a break. If he backpedals any faster, he'll trip over his walker. "
"Frasier: All right, I'll do it. "
"Martin: Oh, great I really appreciate it... you won't forget to ask Bulldog, will ya? "
"Frasier: I'll leave a note on his hydrant. "
"Daphne: A bachelor auction. I've always thought it would be fun to pick a man off the block to do my bidding and fulfill my every desire. Dr. Crane? "
"Niles: I'd love to. [realises Daphne is offering him some champagne] I mean, ah... Frasier? I was just thinking, what if no-one bids? What if you're left standing there, with flop sweat trickling down your back, amidst a great, gaping silence. "
"Martin: It'll never happen, Niles. "
"Frasier: Thank you, dad. "
"Martin: Yeah, we got a band "
"TO: "
"C: Backstage at the bachelor auction. Frasier and Bulldog "

"Frasier: Well, I've got news for "

"Frasier: Thank you, no "
"say:- "
"Announcer: Please, please. Keep articles of clothing off the stage "
"Martin: Man, you show these women a little celebrity beefcake and they go nutso. "
"Frasier: I don't mind telling you dad, I'm a little bit nervous. This is a textbook case of mob mentality. I hope all the fire exits are clearly marked. "
"Martin: Ah, relax, relax, will ya? "
"Frasier: Right, that's easy for you to say. You're not the one jumping into the Rottweiler pit with a pork chop around your neck "
"Martin: Hey Frasier, that's T.J. Smith, he's a linebacker for the Seahawks. They call him “The Enforcer,” he's put two quarterbacks in hospital already this season. Hey, T.J. Marty Crane, nice to meet ya. "
"Manager: Number 19? T.J."
": Please don't make me go out there. "
"Martin: Oh, you'll be fine. Don't worry, just go on out there and have a good time. "
"Martin: They're gonna have him for breakfast. "
"TO: "
"Bulldog: Hey, T.J. How was it, man? T.J."

"Roz: Where do I pay? "
"Frasier: Roz "
"Roz: I saw what I wanted and I went after it. [T.J. makes to back off] Stay "
"Manager: Number 20? "
"Frasier: That's me. "
"Martin: You know son, I haven't had a chance to tell you how much I appreciate this. You know, having somebody like you in the auction really adds class. "
"Frasier: My pleasure, dad. "
"Martin: Now, if the bidding gets slow, drop a quarter and take a couple of minutes to pick it up. "
"TO: "
"Announcer: Sold To that very determined lady in the back row for five hundred dollars. "
"Bulldog: So Doc, who bought ya? "
"Frasier: I have no idea. Last thing I remember is someone shouting out, “Shake your money maker.” "
"Manager: Number 21? "
"Bulldog: Ladies Start your engines "
"Christina: Dr. Crane? Christina Harper. I just bought you. "
"Frasier: You? You? You... bought me. "
"Christina: I listen to your show all the time, I'm a big fan of yours. "
"Frasier: Well, how... wonderful. Ah, you bought me for, for five hundred dollars. That's a lot of money. "

"Christina: No, I'm a model. "
"Frasier: A model How wonderful. For you. "
"Christina: So um, how about Friday? "
"Frasier: Ah, Friday's fine. I live at the Elliot Bay Towers on the Counterbalance. Ah, around seven? "
"Christina: Sounds great. See you then. "
"Frasier: Bye. "
"Frasier: That's my new owner. She's a model. "
"Bulldog: No kidding, she almost put my eye out. "
"Frasier: So you're back awfully quick. "
"Bulldog: Hey-hey I was one of the last guys out there The money was running low, but - there was still one rawhide chew toy out there for the Bulldog. "
"Bulldog: I gotta take a squirt. When I come back, we'll play fetch. "
"Frasier: Oh my God, Daphne. Why? "
"Daphne: Things were slowing down, so your father asked me to shill. I opened at a hundred dollars, who knew that would be the only bid? "
"TO: "
"B: The Frasier Residence. "
"Frasier: Christina. Buenas noches. "
"Christina: Hi, Frasier. Sorry I'm late, but I got a last minute call for a job. "
"Frasier: Oh, well that's all right, you're here now, and you look enchanting. "
"Christina: No, you don't understand. The job's tonight. But we could have dinner later. "
"Frasier: Oh, well I suppose that's all right. "
"Christina: I hope you didn't go to too much trouble? "
"Frasier: Oh, no-no-no-no-no. "
"Christina: You rented a restaurant trolley. "
"Frasier: No, no, I own it. Don't tell me that you don't have one? "
"Christina: There's just one more thing. Um, my friend Sandy got called in on the same job, and she was supposed to look after my daughter. "
"Frasier: Don't tell me you want me to babysit? "
"Christina: Look, I wouldn't do this, but I'm really in a jam. Look, Sandy'll take her as soon as we get back, and umm, that'll leave just the two of us. "
"Frasier: Christina, I'm not really sure if I can... "
"Frasier: I'll make a lot of points for this, won't I? "
"Christina: A ton. "
"Frasier: Bring the darling in. "
"Christina: Dr. Crane, this is my daughter Renata. "
"Frasier: Hello. "
"Christina: She's shy at first. See you later. "
"Frasier: Well... come on in, have a seat. Can I get you, um, a soft drink? Goose liver pate? Renata, that's a pretty name. I suppose it has some poetic, romantic significance... "
"Renata: Can I use your phone? "
"Frasier: Now, Renata. We're going to be spending the evening together, let's try to make the best of it, shall we? I may surprise you, you know. I'm probably more “with it” than you think I am... the phone's right there. "
"A: Time Lapse at Frasier's Apartment. "
"Renata: No way That is so fresh. No way. No way. No... way. Hold on, there's another call. He'll call you back. No way... "
"Frasier: Who was that? "
"Renata: I don't know. No way Oh god, another call's coming in. "
"Frasier: Do you mind? I'll answer this one, thank you. Hello? It's for you. "
"Renata: Hello? Hey, Tiffany. "
"Frasier: Tiffany? I thought you just spoke to Tiffany? "
"Renata: That was Tiffany Schwartz. This is Tiffany Martinez. "
"Frasier: Celebrate the ethnic mosiac that is America, but nonetheless... "
"Renata: What's your damage? "
"Frasier: Well, I'll tell you what my damage is, young lady. You've been Talking on the phone for an hour and a half. You haven't said a word to me except to ask for more Cheetos. They're coming, Eddie "
"Renata: Excuse me. Like I'm supposed to be happy I'm here? Her Fabulousness dumps me with a total stranger who could be a total perv. "
"Frasier: Well, I'm not exactly thrilled about it either, but your mother was in a bind. And for the record, I am not a perv. "
"Renata: You don't get it. She is always doing stuff like this. She's a flake. "
"Frasier: Nonetheless, flake or not, you are in my charge. I think it's Time you had something that was a bit more nutritious. Now, how about some seafood crepes? Lobster Neuberg? Corn dog dipped in curare? "
"Renata: You got any raw cookie dough? "
"Frasier: Even more lethal. Yes, just come on into the kitchen, we'll See what we've got. "
"Renata: You know, you wouldn't have gotten anywhere with this gourmet Meal routine. She eats like, nothing. She's a total diet freak. That's all she talks about, besides herself. "
"Frasier: You don't care much for your mother, do you? "
"Renata: Well, duh. "
"Frasier: You know, I have a son. I'd hate to think by the time he's your age, he thinks of me as some sort of, um... "
"Renata: Dweeb? "
"Frasier: Thank you. "
"Renata: Brace yourself. "
"Frasier: Oh well, look what we have here. [pulls a packet of cookie dough from the freezer] Will one tube suffice? "
"Frasier: Put that in your pipe and smoke it. "
"Frasier: Well now, Renata, you know, I am a psychiatrist. And um, if you're having problems with your mother I'd be glad to listen. "
"Renata: You mean you want me to tell you all my problems like those Gomers on your show? Like you care. "
"Frasier: I do care about the Gomers. I even care about you. "
"Renata: Don't make me hurl She keeps telling people I'm younger than I am. "
"Frasier: Why do you think she does that? "
"Renata: So they won't know how old she is. I've been nine for the past three years. "
"Frasier: Really? "
"Renata: That's nothing. Once, she promised to take me ice-skating for my birthday? On the way there she saw a tattoo parlor. So she just left me out on the sidewalk 'til she could get a stupid butterfly tattooed on her shoulder. It's like she forgot I was even out there. "
"Frasier: My God How old were you? "
"Renata: That was the first time I was nine. "
"Frasier: What does your father say about all this? "
"Renata: Tony? He's on the road with Whitesnake all the time. "
"Frasier: Whitesnake? Is that a musical group or a pet? "
"Renata: It's his new wife. "
"TO: "
"B: Back of Bulldog's stretch limo. "
"Daphne: I must confess, I was a little apprehensive about going out with you tonight. But I'm actually having a jolly time. Unless of course it's the champagne getting to me. I have had quite a bit, haven't I? Oh, who cares? That's the beauty of being in a limo. Unless of course the driver's drinking. [into intercom] You're not drinking, are you? He's not drinking. Let's drink to the driver not drinking. "
"Bulldog: Man, you're really looped, this is great. "
"Daphne: Well, that's annoying, isn't it? Certainly is taking a long time getting out of this parking lot. Did I mention this was my first basketball game? Yes, of course I did, three or four times. I still can't get over those players. They are positively gigantic. Not that being tall is the only measure of a man... but it's a bloody good one. Oh dear, I just insulted you, didn't I? Sorry. Oh well, you can take it, you're a tough little nut. "
"Daphne: Oh, dear. This is not good. Not good at all. "
"Bulldog: What, you don't like the champagne? "
"Daphne: No, I can see the bottom of me glass. "
"Bulldog: Well, bottoms up "
"Daphne: Oh, you are a naughty boy. Now don't go getting any ideas. Oh, look who I'm saying this to. You don't have an idea in your head Did it again. I insulted you. Let's drink to that. Boom "
"Daphne: Now that is downright rude. [lowers window and yells through a speaker-cone] Hey, you there You in the Firebird Yes, you Stop that honking Now, now, just because you look stupid doesn't mean you have to act stupid "
"Bulldog: Hey Don't aggravate him, we're kinda pinned in here. "
"Daphne: Oh, posh Civilization's not going to progress one iota unless someone points out when people's manners are remiss. OH, SHUT YOUR BLOODY CAKEHOLE "
"Bulldog: Don't do that Great, now he's getting out of his car "
"Daphne: Ooh, he's a tall one too. "
"Bulldog: Quick, roll up your window, lock the door. "
"Daphne: Don't be stupid, he's not going to hurt a woman. "
"Bulldog: Just roll it up, roll it up "
"Daphne: Get your bloody claws off him Let him go, you big ugly oaf "
"Bulldog: SHUT UP "
"Daphne: Oh. Well, we're moving. [through the speaker-cone, to Bulldog outside] Thank you, Pitbull I had a lovely time "
"TO: "
"C: Frasier's Apartment. "
"Frasier: You know, this cookie dough is not that bad. Of course, I'm Sure later I'll be hurling. Ah, that must be Her Fabulousness. Want to take the rest home with you? "
"Renata: I'd better not. If I gain an ounce, she goes ballistic. She makes me weigh in every morning. "
"Frasier: You poor thing "
"Renata: I'm used to it. "
"Christina: Hi, I'm back. Sandy's waiting downstairs in the car. "
"Frasier: Renata, I must say I had a rather enjoyable evening. "
"Renata: You don't get out much, do you? "
"Frasier: You know, I think she likes me. "
"Christina: Well uh, thank you for helping me out. Now, roll out that trolley, I'm starving. "
"Frasier: You know, Christina, I don't think so. I think you ought to go home and spend the evening with your daughter. "
"Christina: But I thought we had a date? "
"Frasier: Well, you know, when we first met, I was, well, attracted by your remarkable beauty. But now that I know a bit more about you, well suddenly you don't look so good, sister. "
"Christina: Excuse me? "
"Frasier: A daughter is a privilege, not an inconvenience. You don't Leave her standing on some street corner while you're inside getting tattooed Or keep her in some ageless Never-never Land where everyone is nine for ever and ever "
"Christina: Renata told you I did that. "
"Frasier: Yes She also told me about the morning weigh-in's. And the time you left her with the coat-check girl at the Palladium, so you could go dancing I mean, what kind of excuse for a mother are you, anyway? "
"Christina: Well. Did it ever occur to you that she might be lying? 'Cause this is the first night I've been out in over a year. God knows John and Maryanne never take her. "
"Frasier: Who are they? "
"Christina: Her father and his new wife. "
"Frasier: Oh, who are Tony and Whitesnake? "
"Christina: Our two dogs. Do you know what I do most nights? I stay home. And I help her with her homework, or French lessons. Oh, except last Saturday, when I took her and her twelve friends to an ice-skating party. "
"Frasier: I don't suppose there's any chance that during that party you got your shoulder tattooed? "
"Christina: Do you see anything there? "
"Frasier: No. But then my eyes are tearing up. But why would she lie? "
"Christina: Because she's twelve, and she's mad at me. She wanted to stay home alone, and I wouldn't let her. I probably would have been better off if I had. God, some shrink you are "
"Frasier: Please don't go, child development is not my thing. My specialty is adult relations. "
"Christina: Well, you won't be having any of those tonight. "
"Frasier: Christina, please don't go, I... "
"Christina: Oh, and by the way - I only have one kidney. Guess who has the other? "
"TO: "
"D: Time lapse. Frasier's Apartment. "
"Martin: Is the coast clear? What happened to the supermodel? "
"Frasier: She left. "
"Martin: Oh. Was kinda afraid I might walk in on an embarrassing moment. "
"Frasier: Should have been here half an hour ago. "
"Martin: Well, your date's left, what are you doing still sitting up? "
"Frasier: I was wondering if my sweet little boy's going to turn out to be a monster when he's twelve. "
"Martin: What the hell brought that up? "
"Frasier: Oh, it's a long story. Do you really want to hear it? "
"Martin: Well, it is getting late. Look, all kids are the same. They start out cute, then somewhere along the way they get into that obnoxious, know-it-all stage and you think they'll never grow out of it. "
"Frasier: But eventually they do? "
"Martin: I'm still hoping. "
"Frasier: Hello? Oh, Daphne. How was your evening? ...No way "

"A: KACL corridor. "
"Frasier: Okay, dad. Now, you've seen the executive offices, the advertising offices and the lunchroom. And we now finally come to the sanctum "
"sanctorum: my studio. [points to his picture on the wall] You might recognize that handsome rogue over there. "
"Martin: Wow. Your head photographs even bigger than it is. "
"Frasier: Very droll. Get in. This is what we in the radio game call 'The Booth.' It is here That I sit, day after day, and dispense the advice that helps the emotionally distraught through their troubled lives. "
"Martin: Do you suppose this stuff's bulletproof? "
"Frasier: Dad, you know, you could have gone home after lunch. I just brought you here because I thought you'd enjoy it. [Martin goes to press a button] NOW DON'T TOUCH THAT It's a very sophisticated piece of electronic equipment "
"Martin: What is it? "
"Frasier: I have no idea, Roz told me never to touch it You see dad, the usual procedure begins with... "
"Martin: Testing Testing "
"Frasier: Dad. "
"Martin: Testing. "
"Frasier: Dad, dad, look, let's just go into Roz's booth, okay? You can touch anything you want to in there. "
"Roz: Hey, Frasier. "
"Frasier: Oh, hello Roz. "
"Roz: Hi, Mr. Crane. "
"Martin: Hi. "
"Roz: What brings you here? "
"Frasier: Well, I'm just showing dad around, then he's gonna sit and listen to the show. "
"Martin: Yeah, it's kinda like payback for when Frasier and Niles were kids. I used to take them to the police station and show them where I worked. "
"Frasier: Yes, he made a big game of locking us in one of the cells and pretending to lose the key. "
"Martin: I was just joking with them, I knew they weren't scared. "
"Frasier: Well no, we weren't really scared, although after a while we did become quite hungry. "
"Roz: Hey Frasier, could you lend me ten bucks? "
"Frasier: Did you leave your wallet home, or something? "
"Roz: No, I gave the last of my money to this poor guy down in front of the building. He's an Australian tourist, he lost his wallet and he just needed ten dollars... "
"Martin: So he could take a cab to the Australian Consulate before it closes? "
"Roz: Yeah. How'd you know? "
"Martin: There is no Australian Consulate in Seattle. "
"Roz: Ooh. That poor guy "
"Frasier: Roz, it's a scam. He scammed you. "
"Roz: No, this guy was for real, honest. He even said... "
"Martin: 'If you give me your address, I'll send you the money back with interest.' "
"Roz: God, I'm an idiot. "
"Martin: No, don't feel bad. These guys are professionals. [presses the fast forward button on a reel-to-reel recorder] "
"Roz: DON'T TOUCH THAT "
"Martin: What is this place, a radio station or a nuclear missile site? Now, listen Roz, don't feel bad. I was a cop for thirty years, and they could still fake me out once in a while. These guys are professionals, they know what to do. "
"Frasier: Especially if you're an easy mark like Roz. "
"Martin: Hey, the criminal mind is more complex than you think. They can fool you. "
"Frasier: Oh, by all means dad, lecture me on the complexities of the human mind. Are you forgetting that I graduated with honors from Harvard in Psychosocial Behaviorism? "
"Martin: I know, I was at your graduation. Impressive bunch. A car backfired and half of them wet their gowns. "
"Frasier: It sounded louder on the dais All I'm trying to say is, if it were me on the street, I wouldn't have been fooled. "
"Martin: Oh, you think because of your book smarts, that you can spot a crook just like that, huh? "
"Frasier: Well if I can't, I'm in the wrong business. "
"Martin: You want to put your money where your mouth is? "
"Frasier: What do you mean? "
"Martin: Well, I've got three people coming over for poker tonight. Two of them are cops, the third one's done time in jail. I'll bet you five bucks you can't tell which one's the ex-con. "
"Roz: Hey, can I get in on the action? "
"Frasier: Of course you can. "
"Roz: Great. Ten bucks on your dad. "
"Frasier: Oh, you're just itching to give your money away today, aren't you? All right, you're both on. But I think you're underestimating me. What truffles are to pigs, so are these charlatans and pettifoggers to my mental acuity. "
"Martin: We didn't know better back then. His mother smoked during pregnancy. "
"B: Frasier's residence. "
"Daphne: So, who are these people coming over tonight? "
"Frasier: Oh, just some of dad's old friends from the precinct. "
"Daphne: Yeah well, if we're having company, someone should have been cleaned up. Because someone hasn't been smelling so fresh lately. Because someone is long overdue for a tub. "
"Martin: Hey, I took a shower this morning. "
"Daphne: You know I was talking about Eddie. He's long overdue for a... "
"Martin: Hey, don’t Don't say that word. "
"Daphne: What word? "
"Martin: B-A-T-H. "
"Frasier: When he yawns it may smell like swamp gas, but his spelling's improving. "
"Daphne: I've made meatball sandwiches, pepperoni pizzas and uh, little sausage rolls. Will you be needing anything else? "
"Frasier: The number of the nearest gastroenterologist. "
"Martin: Hey guys, come on in. "
"enter: a heavyset man in his fifties (Frank), "
"Martin: These are my poker pals. This is Linda, Frank and Jimmy. "
"Frasier: Linda, Frank, Jimmy. "
"Martin: This is my son, Frasier. Throw your coats on the couch. Kinda hard to tell, isn't it? They all look like they did time. "
"Frasier: Well, my dad tells me he's filled you in on our little bet. Now the ground rules for tonight are that I'm not allowed to ask you any questions directly about your line of work, but whatever questions I do ask, you must answer truthfully. "
"Frank: All I want to do is play cards. "
"Jimmy: Great place you've got here, Martin. "
"Martin: Ah, thanks. "
"Frasier: Actually, it's mine. "
"Jimmy: Boy, you must do pretty well on that radio show of yours. What is this place, about two thousand square feet? "
"Frasier: About. Hmm... that's interesting, you noticed the space. Most people mention the view and the high ceilings, but you, you mentioned the space. It's almost as if you'd spent some time living in a cramped, confining, tight area. "
"Frank: So you've been to Jimmy's apartment, huh? "
"Daphne: Hello there. "
"Martin: Oh hi, Daphne. This is Daphne Moon, these are my friends, Linda, Frank, Jimmy. "
"Frank: Very pretty name. Do people call you Daffy for short? "
"Daphne: Not twice. Well, it's nice to meet all of you. Here you go, I've got beers for everyone. "
"Frank: Still drinking the Ballantines, I see. "
"Linda: Yeah. When you kick off, that company's going down the tubes. "
"Daphne: Oh, yeah. Many's the time I come home to see cans of them, lined up one after another on the coffee table, like little tin soldiers they are... "
"Martin: Yeah, thanks a lot, Daphne. Don't you have a dog to wash? "
"Daphne: Well, I suppose I do. Of course, I have to catch the little bugger first. Oh, maybe one of these would help. "
"Jimmy: Hey, beer's not good for dogs. "
"Daphne: No, but it's super for me. "
"Jimmy: Marty, she's pretty nice. "
"Linda: Yeah, and sexy too, you dirty old man "
"Martin: Oh... "
"Frasier: Interesting... you find her attractive, do you? "
"Linda: Sure, don't you? "
"Frasier: Yes, but I mean, attraction to one's own sex is a not uncommon result of long-enforced periods of time spent exclusively in their company. "
"Martin: Wow, Frasier. I may have underestimated you. "
"Frasier: Really? "
"Martin: Yeah, you're making a bigger jackass of yourself than I thought. "
"Jimmy: High card deals. "
"Frasier: You know, we could really use some music. Anybody play the harmonica? "
"Frank: All right, my deal. Dollar in to start, five card draw, jacks or better to open and the three raise maximum. "
"Martin: Sure you don't want to play, Fras? "
"Frasier: Oh, no-no-no-no-no, I'll just take this time to observe the triumvirate. I believe in my considerable education, my years of study and not to mention, well... alright, let's say it, my God-given gift to intuit. "
"Frank: This is the kid who used to get his head flushed in the toilet, right? "
"Frank: Okay, I call. What do ya got? "
"Linda: Full boat, aces up. "
"Frank: Damn it That's another one. I'm losing my shirt here. "
"Daphne: Would somebody mind giving me a hand with the coffee? "
"Jimmy: Yeah. I'll give you a hand. "
"Daphne: Come along then. "
"Jimmy: I really like your accent. Where are you from? "
"Daphne: Manchester. "
"Jimmy: Manchester. That's where the Beatles are from, right? "
"Daphne: Oh, no-no. You're thinking Liverpool. "
"Jimmy: Then who's from Manchester? "
"Daphne: No-one. That's why I live here now. "
"Martin: You've been awfully quiet there. "
"Frasier: I'm sorry, dad. Just been observing. "
"Martin: No no, don't apologize, it was a compliment. "
"Frasier: Frank's an interesting study, isn't he? Temper, loner, a bit unsocial. Almost a stereotypical portrait of a man who's spent his entire life behind bars. "
"Frank: This dish a Lalique or a Steuben? "
"Martin: They had no spots open in the prison laundry, he worked in fine china and glassware. "
"Frank: Here you go, big winner. Buy yourself something pretty and frilly. "
"Linda: Sorry Frank, I can't hear you. I've got your money stuck in my ears. "
"Martin: Well, I guess there's only one thing left. How about it, Fras? You figured it out yet? "
"Frasier: Actually, I believe I have. Shall we step into the drawing room? Please have a seat. "
"Martin: Okay, Sherlock. You've got center stage. "
"Frasier: I have sketched an accurate psychological profile of each one of you. And in so doing I have come to the incontrovertible conclusion that the criminal among us can only be... FRANK "
"Martin: Wrong. Frank's a highly decorated undercover cop. "
"Frasier: Exactly Just a little too obvious, you know. The broken vocabulary, the jailhouse pallor, the underdeveloped social skills... "
"Frank: Hey. "
"Frasier: So, you tried to use psychology against me, did you? Threw a gender bender at me. Thinking I'd just assume that a felon would naturally be a man. Well, I'm on to your little game, mister. The criminal among us is indeed, the very wily Linda "
"Linda: Nope. "
"Frasier: JIMMY "
"Martin: Hey. You're right. "
"Frasier: Damn it... you seem like such a nice guy. "
"Jimmy: I am a nice guy. "
"Martin: He was voted most congenial in his cellblock. "
"Jimmy: Sorry, doc. I'm afraid you owe your old man five bucks. "
"Frasier: Yeah, I'm afraid I do. "
"Jimmy: Oh. You'll probably use this. "
"Linda: Well, it's been a lot of laughs, but it's getting late. We better get going. "
"Frank: Yeah, you're right. Thanks a lot, Marty. "
"Martin: Oh, yes. Great. "
"Frasier: It's been very pleasant. You'll all come again, any time you like. Hopefully when we're here, of course. "
"Frank: Goodnight, Marty, "
"Martin: See ya. "
"Jimmy: Next week, Marty. "
"Martin: Yeah, yeah. "
"Frasier: Jimmy. Boy, who woulda thought? How do you even know that guy, dad? "
"Martin: Ah, he was a jailhouse snitch, he helped us out a couple of times. Right, he's great company, but I wouldn't trust him for a second if he wasn't surrounded by cops. "
"Daphne: Who's a jailhouse snitch? "
"Martin: Jimmy. "
"Daphne: Jimmy's an ex-con? "
"Frasier: Well, you certainly made your point. I feel stupid as hell. "
"Daphne: I feel rather a fool meself. "
"Martin: Why would you care, one way or another? "
"Daphne: Because... I've agreed to go out with Jimmy tomorrow night. "
"Martin: You did what? "
"Daphne: He asked me if I'd like to go out for drinks with him to a place called the Topaz Room, meet some of his friends. It sounded harmless enough. "
"Martin: Well, it's out of the question You're gonna have to call him and cancel "
"Daphne: But you said yourself he was fun to spend time with. "
"Martin: I said DO time with. No, no. You just can't go. Case closed, that's all there is to it. "
"Frasier: Dad, excuse me, if I can interrupt that self-righteous policeman mentality for a second, don't you believe in second chances? "
"Martin: I did. Then we had Niles. "
"Frasier: Well, I believe that when a man has paid his debt to society he deserves a fresh start. I see no harm in her going out with him once. "
"Martin: Well, I do She's not going. "
"Frasier: I say she is. "
"Daphne: Excuse me? Gentlemen? But might I interject one tiny little thought into this conversation? "
"Frasier: Of course, Daphne. "
"Daphne: BELT UP BOTH OF YOU It may have escaped your notice, but I happen to be a grown woman, and nobody has told me whom I might or might not date since I was a schoolgirl. And I didn't listen then. Now, when I've quite made up my mind about what I plan to do about Jimmy, I'll let you know. But right now, I'm going to my room. You two hens have wasted enough of my time. "
"Frasier: That would have been a very dramatic exit, if only her room was down that hall. "
"Martin: I still don't think she should be going out with that guy. "
"Frasier: Oh, don't worry, she won't. "
"Martin: How do you know? "
"Frasier: Well, because she has too much respect for your opinion. She won't go against your wishes if I'm any judge of character. "
"Martin: Oh, dear God. "
"A: Cafe Nervosa. "
"Niles: I'll have a decaf latte, and please be sure to use skim milk. "
"Frasier: I'll have the same. "
"Waiter: Got it. Two Gutless Wonders "
"Niles: Thank you. Certainly playing fast and loose with his tips for a man who drives a van. Oh, oh-oh-oh, Frasier. How was your encounter with dad's poker buddies last night? "
"Frasier: Ah... "
"Niles: I must tell you - the picture of you trying to make conversation with dad's blue-collar cronies all evening is priceless. When I told Maris about it, it was all she could do to keep her eyes from dancing. "
"Frasier: Actually, it was really rather interesting. You know, one of them actually did time in prison for fraud? "
"Niles: Good lord What was he like? "
"Frasier: Actually, he was quite personable. You know dad, he's so judgmental. "
"Niles: He is, and I've often condemned him for it. "
"Frasier: For some reason, you know, just because the man was in prison he seems to have marked him for life. "
"Niles: It's ridiculous. Not all criminals are recidivists. I've seen many cases where after they've paid their debt to society they've gone on to lead productive lives. Dad's just being narrow-minded. "
"Frasier: Hmm. Yes, I almost had to sedate him when Daphne announced that she was going to go out with him. "
"Niles: Frasier, I hope you're just yanking my giggle chain. "
"Frasier: What do you mean? "
"Niles: You're telling me that you're letting this English rose be sullied by some sociopath? "
"Frasier: Niles, he passed bad checks. He's not a sociopath. "
"Niles: He's a degenerate who should be put away forever "
"Frasier: You haven't even met him. "
"Niles: Oh, for God's sake, they're all depraved animals "
"Waiter: Here's your coffee. Anything else? "
"Niles: Yes, the check please, and quickly. Frasier, we've got to rescue her "
"Frasier: Oh Niles, Niles, just sit down and relax, for God's sakes. You're being irrational. "
"Niles: Don't you DARE call me irrational You know that makes me crazy "
"Frasier: Now, Niles. Listen, I think Jimmy's a perfectly nice guy. And besides, Daphne can take care of herself. "
"Niles: I don't care, I'm going after her. [gets up and puts on his coat] I'm not without resources. My Tae Kwon Do instructor tells me I'm just two moves away from becoming quite threatening "
"Frasier: Niles, just listen to me for a second. You know perfectly well that she'll resent any interference. Now, you want to make a fool of yourself, go right ahead, but don't ask me to join you. "
"Niles: That's fine. Just tell me where they went. "
"Frasier: Someplace called the, uh, the Topaz Room. "
"Waiter: The Topaz Room? I thought the cops shut that place down after the last shooting. "
"Frasier: I'll drive "
"TO: "
"B: The Topaz Room, a gritty bar. "
"Leo: Your shot, girlie. "
"Leo: But before you take that shot, why don't we make this a little more interesting? All you have to do to win is run those last five balls. So what do you say we double our bet? "
"Daphne: Oh, well. I might as well. I never really have understood this game. Never understood it, when I started playing with me older brothers, at the age of six. And I never understood it during all my formative years, spent mostly in the pool halls of Manchester. Playing in local competitions and club tournaments. Winning cup after cup after cup. Until our poor dad had to convert the pantry into a trophy room. And I can't really claim to understand it - eight ball in far corner - even today. But I certainly do enjoy it. [collects her winnings to the applause of the customers] Thank you, gentlemen. And now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to attempt to use the ladies room without touching anything. "
"Frasier: Look at this place. I never felt so conspicuous in my life. "
"Niles: You must simply try to blend in. Fortunately, I haven't shaved in several hours. You should loosen your tie. "
"Frasier: Yes, and you might try tucking in your watch fob. "
"Niles: That happens to be a Phi-Beta-Kappa key. "
"Frasier: Oh, then by all means, let it dangle. Perhaps they have a local chapter. "
"Niles: Actually, this is quite stimulating in a lower-depths sort of way. And I've always been something of a squalor buff. "
"Frasier: The only problem is, I don't see Daphne or Jimmy. "
"Niles: Excuse me. Has a young woman been in here this evening, approximately five foot nine and three quarters, with skin the color of Devonshire cream and the sort of eyes that gaze directly into one's soul with neither artifice nor evasion? "
"Frasier: This would be an Englishwoman called Daphne. "
"Bartender: Ah yeah, the one who came in with Jimmy. "
"Frasier: Right. "
"Bartender: She was over there shooting pool a minute ago. I think she stepped in the back. "
"Frasier: What happened to Jimmy? "
"Bartender: He tried to get fresh with her. She threw a hammerlock on him and ran him out of here. That babe can take care of herself. "
"Frasier: I told you so. "
"Bartender: And good riddance too. Guy was no good. I knew it the first time I saw him. You can always tell. "
"Frasier: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on Niles, we've taken our walk on the wild side, let’s get out of here. "
"Niles: What about Daphne? "
"Frasier: Well come on, you heard what she did to Jimmy. Think how mad she'll be if she should find us here. "
"Niles: You're right. Best make ourselves scarce. [Daphne comes out] Good lord, there she is "
"Frasier: Oh, oh. God, I am so sorry. "
"Rocco: Hey What the hell are you doing? "
"Frasier: I'm sorry, I was just trying to... "
"Rocco: You made me miss that shot. "
"Frasier: I'm sorry. "
"Rocco: I had two hundred bucks riding on that shot. "
"Frasier: Really sorry. "
"Rocco: Where do you think you're going? "
"Niles: Ah, I'll be back, I was just going to put another quarter in the meter. "
"Rocco: The meters don't run at night, and neither do you. "
"Niles: Oh, that was rather an amusing play on words, you're a regular George S. Kaufman, we must tell our friends about this. "
"Rocco: You owe me two hundred dollars. "
"Frasier: Oh well, I-I'd gladly pay you, but I-I don't have that kind of cash on me. "
"Niles: Even if he did, it would be absurd to bring it into a place like this. You know, with the kind of element you might run into... "
"Frasier: Niles Maybe I could write you a check? "
"Rocco: My element don't take checks. I think maybe we should take these guys outside, and wise them up. "
"Frasier: Oh, I don't think that's really necessary at all. "
"Daphne: Oh my goodness What are you two doing here? "
"Niles: We might ask you the same thing. This happens to be one of our favorite haunts. Actually, Maris and I had our rehearsal dinner here... the place was different then, it was more of a garden room and there was a trellis over there where the bar is... "
"Frasier: Shut up, Niles. "
"Daphne: You followed me, didn't you? "
"Frasier: Oh Daphne, we were worried about you. "
"Rocco: Excuse me, lady. But it seems like your friends can't seem to come up with the two hundred they owe me, so I'm gonna have to uh - pardon my French - beat the crap out of them. "
"Frasier: Listen, listen. I'm a psychiatrist, maybe we can talk this out in sessions. You know, it seems that you have some control issues... "
"Rocco: Outside "
"Daphne: WAIT I have money. How would you like to go for double or nothing, sport? "
"Rocco: On what? "
"Daphne: Well, you look like a betting man. I'll wager I can sink these five balls with a single shot. If I do, these boys are square. If I miss, you double your money. "
"Rocco: Hey. I don't mind taking your money, but I was kinda looking forward to pulping this guy. "
"Daphne: Yeah, well. We won't quibble. If I miss, you can pulp him. I'm feeling generous tonight. I'll throw in the little one as well. "
"Niles: What did she mean by that, “Throw in the little one?” And what in God's name is “pulping”? "
"Rocco: You're on. Okay. But just to make sure this is on the up and up, let's use six balls. Instead of sinking all five with one shot, how about sinking all six? Do that and uh, I'll forget the two hundred bucks. "
"Daphne: Fair enough. Need a bit of chalk for me cue. Does it matter in what order I make them? "
"Frasier: Daphne "
"Rocco: Hey lady. If you make any of them, it'll be a miracle. "
"Daphne: Right. Well... here goes nothing. "
"Daphne: RUN FOR IT ” faces before fleeing "

"Hank: So, Dr. Crane, I just don't know what to do about my weight. I've tried diet after diet, from the 'milkshakes three times a day' to that scary bald-headed lady on TV. Nothing seems to work. "
"Frasier: Hank, listen to me. You've got to look inside yourself. There is a part of you that isn't being fed. "
"Hank: Well, it certainly isn't my butt. "
"Frasier: Yes, well, I'm talking about your inner self. What isn't being fed there? Love, career, simple self-esteem? There are deeper issues at work here. "
"Hank: So, so what do I do? "
"Frasier: Well, I'd suggest extended therapy. Please stay on the line, and my producer Roz will refer you to the help you need. Roz, who's our next call? "
"Roz: We have someone on line one who disagrees with your advice to Hank. "
"Frasier: Ah, really? Hello, you're on the line. "
"Lilith: Congratulations, Frasier, you've done it again. "
"Lilith: You've led another unsuspecting innocent down one of your dark, dead-end Freudian hallways. "
"Frasier: Lilith? "
"Lilith: Overeating is very simply a behavioral problem caused by negative reinforcement. It can be cured quite readily by behavior modification. "
"Frasier: I see. Well, Seattle, we have a celebrity of sorts on the line. This is my ex-wife, Lilith. "
"Lilith: What do you mean by 'celebrity?' "
"Frasier: Roz, what exactly does 'call screening' mean? "
"Roz: It means I get to put on the air the calls I want to hear. "
"Frasier: Well, Lilith, what brings you to Seattle — the constant rain? "
"Lilith: I'm here for a convention, and I happened to hear your voice on the radio. I kept hoping you'd introduce Pearl Jam's latest hit, but much to my chagrin, you were doling out worthless little advice pellets from your psychiatric Pez dispenser. "
"Frasier: Well, I guess you'll be rushing off to your little convention now, and I suppose we'll just have to catch up on your next trip. "
"Lilith: Actually, I'm not doing anything for dinner tonight. "
"Frasier: Really? Well, then you'll want to keep your dial tuned to 780 for Gil Chesterton's 'Restaurant Beat.' "
"Roz: Why don't you ask her out to dinner, Dr. Crane? "
"Frasier: What a wonderful idea [takes a piece of paper and a Magic Marker and starts writing] And let me tell you why, Seattle. You see, even though our marriage was unsuccessful, Lilith and I are quite capable of conducting ourselves as adults, and even enjoying spending some time together, from time to time. So, Lilith, seven at my place? "
"Lilith: Sounds great. ' She holds up a manila folder on which is scribbled, "
"Martin: In my day, when two people broke up you were mad, you were angry, you hated each other Whatever happened to the sanctity of divorce? "
"Frasier: Dad, you never liked Lilith. "
"Martin: She's weird. "
"Frasier: She is not weird. "
"Martin: Oh, she's weird. "
"Frasier: Well, maybe she's a little strange. "
"Martin: No, Maris is a little strange. Lilith is weird. "
"Niles: Gee whiz, Dad, I had no idea you preferred my wife to Frasier's. "
"Daphne: Oh, my head "
"Frasier: Can I get you an aspirin, Daphne? "
"Daphne: Oh, no, no, I'm afraid those are useless. This is one of my psychic headaches. There's some kind of negative force out there. I only get these when there's a clawing at the cosmic continuum. "
"Niles: Perhaps if someone rubbed your temples... "
"Frasier: Niles I'm sure she wants privacy while she contacts the mother ship. "
"Niles: Frasier, I must tell you, I'm here for support, but I will not speak to Lilith. "
"Frasier: Oh, Niles, this ongoing feud between you and Lilith is ridiculous Let it go, it was years ago. "
"Martin: I can't even remember what the fight was about in the first place. "
"Niles: Well, let me refresh you At our wedding, while Maris was reciting her vows — which she wrote herself — vows of love from the heart, I distinctly heard snickering. I glanced behind me and there was Lilith, her fingers pressed hard against her lips, her body shaking like a paint mixer. "
"Frasier: All right, now, now, there she is. All right, now—now listen, it's just one evening out of your life. Will you at least try to be civil? "
"Niles: All right, but I refuse to be warm. "
"Frasier: Hello, Lilith. "
"Lilith: Frasier. "
"Frasier: Please come in. "
"Frasier: Here, let me take these things for you. There we are. Oh, look who's here. "
"Lilith: Hello, Martin. Hello, Niles. "
"Martin: Hello. "
"Lilith: Where's Maris? "
"Niles: She's visiting her sister in Chicago. "
"Lilith: Oh. I thought perhaps she was sailing up the transplendent river of your love. "
"Lilith: Frasier, I like what you've done with your apartment. "
"Frasier: Thank you. "
"Lilith: You have beautiful things. "
"Frasier: The settlement is final, Lilith. "
"Lilith: Go away. "
"Frasier: Why does he listen to you, and not to me? "
"Lilith: By the tone of my voice, he senses I mean business. "
"Frasier: Oh, I see. You're saying your voice is more commanding than mine is? "
"Martin: Hell, I took a half a step before I realized she was talking to the dog. "
"Daphne: Oh, hello — I've never had a throbbing like this "
"Frasier: Daphne, um, this is my ex-wife, Dr. Lilith Sternin. Lilith, this is Daphne Moon, my dad's physical therapist. "
"Lilith: It's nice to meet you. "
"Daphne: An equal pleasure. When I shook hands with that woman, I lost all feeling in my arm "
"Niles: Frasier, I'm going to pop into your bedroom and use the phone. Maris was developing some sniffles, I just want to make sure she's taking in enough liquids. "
"Lilith: Isn't it enough that she's eternally sipping from the font of your perpetual adoration? ' ' Niles exits. "
"Lilith: Martin, I'm especially delighted to see you here tonight. "
"Martin: Oh yeah? "
"Lilith: Oh yes. Knowing as I do the history of your relationship with Frasier, when I heard that he'd taken you in, I immediately flipped to the weather channel to see if hell had indeed frozen over. "
"Martin: Frasier, how'd you let ever this little peach get away? "
"Frasier: Well, I think dinner's just about ready. Why don't we move to the table. "
"Frasier: So, Lilith, how is Frederick? "
"Lilith: Well, as you know, I've enrolled him in that chess camp in the Berkshires. It's really quite stimulating. For eight hours a day, he sits in a large auditorium, with 300 other children, mastering the Alhausen-Grob Opening. "
"Martin: Well, he's in the mountains. Shouldn't he be out there in the fresh air? "
"Lilith: Every day after lunch they go for a nature walk. Unfortunately, Frederick is allergic to seven different varieties of ivy, so he has to wear long sleeves, and long pants... a bonnet with a net on it. "
"Frasier: Boy, I sure hope the other campers don't make fun of him. "
"Martin: Oh, I'm sure they don't. You know how kind kids can be. Hell, all he needs is a birthmark on his forehead, and they'd beat him to death with a shovel "
"TO: "
"Martin: So, I chased this guy down a dark alley, and when he got to the end he turned and pulled a knife on me. So I gave him a couple of good shots with my nightstick. "
"Lilith: Fascinating. I have to ask, were you at all aware of any repressed sexual urges while you were pummeling him so mercilessly? "
"Martin: Yeah, but I didn't put 'em in the report. "
"Lilith: You're having some fun at my expense, aren't you? "
"Martin: Not much. In fact, I'm going to bed. Goodnight. "
"Frasier: Goodnight, Dad. "
"Daphne: Oh, well, if you don't need me any longer, I think I'll be shuffling off as well. "
"Frasier: Well, goodnight. "
"Daphne: It was a pleasure meeting you. By the way, how many days will you be staying in Seattle? "
"Lilith: Just through the weekend. "
"Daphne: Well, enjoy your stay. I'll be dead by Saturday night, I know it "
"Niles: Well, I guess I'll say my goodbyes as well. Goodnight, Frasier. "
"Frasier: Oh, this is ridiculous Listen, Lilith, uh, Niles is upset because you snickered at Maris's wedding vows. "
"Lilith: I simply responded with the genuine spontaneous emotion I was feeling at the moment. [Frasier motions her to try harder] But, if Niles is not mature enough to accept that, if he is so pitifully insecure, if he is in such need of validation, then I guess for some sense of familial harmony, I do apologize. "
"Niles: Oh, this bad blood between us has gone on far too long Next time you're in town, we'll have dinner, just you and me "
"Frasier: He doesn't get that kind of validation at home, you see. "
"Lilith: Well, it's just the two of us. "
"Frasier: Yes. It's the first time we've been alone together since the lawyers put us in that room and said, 'Don't come out until there's some resolution.' "
"Lilith: Yes, well, this was nice. "
"Frasier: Yes it was, wasn't it? "
"Lilith: You have a beautiful view. "
"Frasier: Well, it's a beautiful city. I hope you enjoy your convention. "
"Lilith: Oh, for God's sake, Frasier. There is no convention. I'm here because of the letter. "
"Frasier: The letter? What letter? "
"Lilith: You know very well what letter. The one you left in the apartment last month when you were home to visit Frederick, the one proposing we get back together. Surely you didn't forget? "
"Lilith: 'My darling, how could a love like ours have fallen so far from grace? There must be some part of your heart that still resounds to the rhythm of my own. I fear that I'll be lost without you. As long as we have love, love will keep us together.' Aside from the shameless pilfering from the Captain and Tenille, I was moved by your entreaty. I felt the same way, and yet I felt the need to create this pretense of arriving here for a convention, because I was still torn and unable to commit myself. But seeing you now, I realize how much I've missed you. "
"Frasier: Lilith, I did write that letter, and I did leave it in the apartment, but... "
"Lilith: Yes? "
"Frasier: It wasn't last month. It was nearly a year ago. It's before I moved to Seattle. You just found it now? "
"Lilith: It had fallen behind the dresser. "
"Frasier: Well, I see the cleaning service is still doing its usual bang-up job. "
"Lilith: Well, don't I feel like the perfect fool? "
"Frasier: Listen, Lilith— "
"Lilith: Here I am, humiliated, emotionally drained, and I've used up all my frequent flier miles "
"Frasier: Lilith, please "
"Lilith: No, Frasier, please, there's nothing else to say. I'd like to leave with at least a shred of dignity. "
"Lilith: Thank you. "
"Frasier: I wrote this letter just before I came to Seattle hoping for a reconciliation. She only just now found it. "
"Niles: Didn't the Captain and Tenille sing this? "
"Frasier: Like they own those five words You know, I-I got over her, I moved out here. She comes back and I wonder if I made the right decision. I did write that letter. "
"Niles: It appears you have come to some sort of a crossroads. "
"Frasier: Oh, that's a nice tidy little way of saying I'm in hell. Niles, I have a life here that suits me, and yet I can't help wondering if there is still some chance for reconciliation, if it's worth exploring the feelings that—that I'm feeling. Do you think I should see her again tonight? "
"Niles: Frasier, like most patients who come to a therapist, you already know the answer to the question you're posing. You just want me to agree with your decision and support you whether I share your opinion or not. "
"Frasier: Yes, but I don't have an opinion in this case. "
"Niles: I'm sure you do. "
"Frasier: But I don't. "
"Niles: Well, then I can't help you. "
"Frasier: All right, all right. I think in my soul, I'm leaning toward taking the next step and, uh, seeing if there's anything... there. "
"Niles: That is what you should do. "
"Frasier: Why? "
"Niles: You know why. "
"Frasier: Damn it, Niles "
"Niles: Frasier, you know why. "
"Frasier: All right. We have a long history together, we-we have a son that we both adore. There were some good times, and when they were good... Hoo-ah "
"Niles: Well, it seems our minds are pretty well made up, aren't they? "
"Frasier: Yes, they are. Thank you, Niles. I don't know what I'd do without you. "
"Niles: Yes, you do. "
"Frasier: Drop it "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Hello, Lilith. "
"Lilith: Frasier, come in. "
"Frasier: I must be early, I see you haven't had a chance to put up your hair yet. "
"Lilith: Oh, I thought I'd leave it down tonight. "
"Frasier: Really? "
"Lilith: Yes, after several hours of careful deliberation, and weighing all the consequences, I decided to be playful. I'm glad you invited me to dinner. "
"Frasier: Well, how could I not? I felt so awful about last night. You see, I just thought you'd read the letter long ago and ignored it. "
"Lilith: No explanation necessary. It was a simple misunderstanding. "
"Frasier: O.K. Well, I know a great little French bistro just around the corner— "
"Lilith: Uh, Frasier? Before we go anywhere, I would just like to go on record as saying that, regardless of everything that's happened, I respect you for getting on with your life as successfully as you have. "
"Frasier: Well, I'd like to say that I feel the same way about you. Frederick is flourishing, and I'm sure that's in no small part due to you. "
"Lilith: Oh, thank you. That means a great deal to me. "
"Frasier: Geez, do you realize that's the first pleasant thing we've said to each other in almost a year? "
"Lilith: You're right. "
"Frasier: You know, I'm suddenly quite moved. "
"Lilith: I am too. "
"Frasier: Would it be a dreadful contretemps if I kissed you right now? "
"Lilith: You can always try. "
"Frasier: You want to bag dinner? "
"Lilith: There's a bed and an honor bar, what more do we need? "
"Frasier: Come to me, my white-hot flame "
"Lilith: I was insane to divorce you "
"Frasier: Oh God, you're in my thoughts every waking hour "
"Lilith: You're the only man I've ever loved "
"Frasier: So are you "
"TO: "
"Lilith: Good morning. "
"Frasier: Jolly good morning to you, too. "
"Lilith: I could stay like this all morning. "
"Frasier: Me, too. "
"Lilith: I'm so glad I decided to take the chance and fly out here to be with you. "
"Frasier: Yes, me too, me too. "
"Frasier: Oh, I'll get that "
"Frasier: Must be the breakfast we ordered last night. Boy, I am famished "
"Lilith: You should be. You were a busy boy. "
"Frasier: Hi. "
"Waiter: Good morning, sir. "
"Frasier: Just bring it right in here, please. Uh, that's fine. [tips the waiter] Little something for you, too. Thank you, good day. "
"Frasier: Well, boy, it's funny how life takes it's little turns, isn't it? Yesterday morning when I woke up, I never imagined I'd be waking up here this morning. "
"Lilith: Indeed. "
"Frasier: And — I mean, it's not that we were overly impulsive or anything, or that what we did was wrong, I just... "
"Lilith: This is a mistake. "
"Frasier: Oh, thank God you said that Oh, it's not that last night wasn't very enjoyable, but who are we kidding? You've gotten on with your life, I've gotten on with mine I've got a new career, I've reestablished relationships with my family, I've got a whole new set of friends — for the first time in years, I'm happy I mean, for us to even consider getting back together — it's just the stupidest thing two people could do "
"Lilith: I meant the eggs. I ordered poached, not fried. "
"Frasier: Well, you didn't let me finish, you see... after I played Devil's advocate, I— "
"Lilith: Oh, Frasier, don't insult me That's how you really feel, isn't it? "
"Frasier: I'm afraid so. "
"Frasier: Oh, Lilith, are you crying? God, I'm sorry. Once again, I've led you down an emotional primrose path. Lilith, I never meant to hurt you. I don't blame you if you're mad at me. "
"Lilith: I'm not mad at you, I'm mad at me. I don't even know what I'm doing here I've just been so lonely over the last year, and when I found your letter, it was — it was like a life preserver I'm raising a child alone. I'm scared. I always thought of myself as a strong and independent person, but the truth is, I'm afraid. I guess that's why I convinced myself that I was still in love with you. "
"Frasier: You mean you're not? "
"Lilith: No, I'm not. "
"Frasier: Well, that's good. So then what happened last night was only because you were lonely, and I was— "
"Lilith: We all know what you were, Frasier. "
"Frasier: Oh, Lilith, Lilith, here, here, come with me here. [guides her to the mirror] Now, listen, look in there, tell me what you see. All right, I'll tell you what I see. I see the same strong-willed, dynamic, intelligent woman I married seven years ago. Listen, you're just suffering a temporary lapse — divorce does that to you. Listen, I won't say anything as trite as 'someday you'll find someone.' But I know "
"this: I know you, and I know that no matter what the future holds in store for you, you'll handle it. "
"Lilith: Thank you, Frasier. "
"Frasier: You hungry? "
"Lilith: Yeah. "
"Frasier: O.K. "
"Lilith: You always knew how to buck me up when I was blue. "
"Frasier: Yeah, well, you know you helped me through some hard times yourself. "
"Lilith: You know, those married years weren't all bad. We did have some good moments. "
"Frasier: The best one was Frederick. We'll always have that. "
"Frasier: And, you know, I can't help telling you this. Even though we're not in love anymore, you were always the most exciting lover I ever had. I think in your heart of hearts that you'd say the same about me. "
"Lilith: They screwed up the toast, too, I ordered rye. "
"Frasier: Lilith? "

"Niles: Double Cappuccino, half-caf, not-fat milk, with just enough foam to be aesthetically pleasing but not so much that it leaves a moustache. "
"Eric: Cinnamon or chocolate on that? "
"Niles: Oh, they make this so complicated. Um, cinnamon. "
"Eric: And you? "
"Frasier: Well let me see, I think I'll have the... "
"Niles: Oh look, it's Daphne. Daphne "
"Frasier: Daphne. "
"Daphne: Oh, hello, thought I might run into you here. Oh please, sit, sit. I just stopped in for a bag of beans, we're running low at home. "
"Frasier: Oh, well good. You know, I'd like... "
"Eric: I'd be happy to help. "
"Daphne: Two pounds of... "
"Eric: The Kenya Blend. "
"Daphne: Ho-ho, you remembered. "
"Eric: Hard to forget. "
"Frasier: Excuse me, you haven't taken my order yet. "
"Eric: Most people find that blend too intense. "
"Daphne: Not me, I like something that holds its body on my tongue. "
"Frasier: Excuse me, we seem to have spilled something here. If you could... "
"Eric: I don't suppose you would be into something robust, if it didn't come on too strong. "
"Daphne: If it was a little bit sweet I might take a liking to it. "
"Eric: Would you like to step over to the counter and try my special blend? "
"Daphne: I'd love to. "
"Frasier: Oh, nothing for me, thanks "
"Niles: Frasier, that man is hitting on our Daphne I don't know how she stands it. "
"Frasier: Niles... look, apropos of nothing, how are things between you and Maris? "
"Niles: Are you implying that my concern for Daphne's welfare is anything less than pure? "
"Frasier: I don't know, you tell me. "
"Niles: Frasier, that is your great shortcoming. You're always distrustful, you're always suspicious. Sometimes you just have to have faith that people are all right- what's he doing now? "
"Frasier: I believe he's bagging her beans. "
"Niles: Oh "
"Daphne: Oh, I'm so excited Eric over there is taking me to a club to hear his band tonight. Oh, I know it's not my regular night off but I'll switch it with Saturday, if that's OK with you. Oh, isn't he lovely? I already have a nickname for him, 'Eric The Red.' It favours him, doesn't it? Don't you think he looks like a Viking? "
"Frasier: Well... "
"Daphne: Well, ta-ta Oh, look at me, I forgot my beans. Earth to Daphne "
"Niles: How could she like him? The man has 'community college' written all over him. "
"Frasier: Niles, you know, this infatuation with Daphne is really getting out of hand. I didn't really mind when it was just a flirtation, but I can't help wonder that this is symptomatic of something wrong between you and Maris. Well, is it? "
"Niles: Oh... Frasier, I can't lie to you. The truth is, Maris and I are in a bit of a rut. We seem to have lapsed into this grey, numbing blandness. "
"Frasier: Well, that's perfectly normal in a relationship of some years. Maybe you should try spicing things up a bit. "
"Niles: You mean... boudoir-wise? "
"Frasier: Well, for starters, yeah. "
"Niles: Like how? "
"Frasier: Well, the two of you could... [Niles leans forward expectantly] Well, you could... well it's you and Maris, so you could... I'm stumped. "
"Frasier: Oh, hi Roz, how are you? "
"Roz: Do you really want to know how I am, or are you just making conversation? Because if you really want to know how I am, I'll tell you. "
"Frasier: Well, I was just making conversation. But actually, Roz, there's some advice I need. "
"Roz: About what? "
"Frasier: A subject in which you're quite well-versed, sex. "
"Roz: How can I help you? "
"Frasier: What do you do when... when the romance goes out of a relationship? "
"Roz: I get dressed and go home. "
"Frasier: All right, let's just assume for a moment that you are capable of a long-term relationship; what would you do to keep things cooking? "
"Roz: Well, once I had a boyfriend take me out to a bar, and we pretended we were strangers picking each other up. Actually that was kinda hot. "
"Frasier: So you used, like, fantasy/role-playing? "
"Roz: Yeah. In fact, we had so much fun we tried it again. Only the next time he got so into it he went home with another woman. "
"Frasier: I'm sorry. "
"Roz: Oh hell, she was gorgeous. One more drink, and I'd have gone home with her. My point is that women need to see the men they make love to as exciting, romantic figures. So I say, if you want to keep this woman interested, try creating a fantasy for an evening. Personally, I think you'd make a very sexy gladiator. "
"Frasier: Roz, this is not for me, it's for my brother Niles. "
"Roz: Oh Well in that case, make it a gladiola. "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Niles "
"Frasier: Niles "
"Niles: I'm sorry, Frasier, but something horrible has happened. Maris kicked me out. "
"Frasier: Dear God, why? What for? "
"attire: "
"Frasier: Oh, my. "
"Martin: What's going on out there? Niles? "
"Niles: Hello, dad. "
"Martin: Never mind, I don't want to know. "
"Niles: No dad, wait, there's a perfectly reasonably explanation for the way I'm dressed. "
"Frasier: Alright, just keep in mind that I reserve the right to say 'stop' at any time. "
"Niles: Well, my plan was to leave a treasure map downstairs for Maris with clues that would lead her to my whereabouts. Then I'd hide in the linen closet and wait for her to find me. "
"Martin: Dressed like that? "
"Niles: Actually no, at the time I was wearing only my eye-patch. Although, technically is it still an eye-patch if you're wearing it on your-? "
"Frasier: Stop "
"Niles: There I was lying in wait, with my little plastic knife clenched between my teeth, when the closet door was flung open and I found myself face to face with the upstairs maid. She began screaming what I gather were some very unflattering things in idiomatic Guatemalan, when Maris stumbled upon the scene and completely misconstrued it. The next thing I knew she ordered me out of the house I barely had time to grab my pantaloons and buckle my swash. "
"Niles: Dad? Dad, it's not funny. "
"Martin: Where'd you come up with such a stupid idea? "
"Niles: Frasier "
"Frasier: All I suggested was some sexual role-playing, you're the one that came up with 'Pirates of the Caribbean' "
"Niles: Oh, I've really bungled it this time, haven't I? "
"Martin: Oh come on, these things happen. Look, why don't you just stay here tonight with us and then tomorrow you and Maris can sort things out. "
"Niles: What if we don't? What'll I do then? "
"Frasier: Well, I suppose they could always use another busboy at the 'Jolly Roger' "
"Niles: I'll never be able to face the maid again. "
"Martin: I don't think it's your face she'll remember. "
"Martin: Oh come on, Niles, everybody has an embarrassing story to tell. Did I ever tell you about the time I got locked outside in the backyard in my underwear? "
"Niles: Only every Thanksgiving. "
"Martin: Well, don't worry, I won't be telling that story this year "
"Frasier: Here we are, Canadian goose down pillow, Egyptian cotton sheets and a nice Vicuna throw in case you get a little chilly during the night. "
"Niles: How perfect "
"Martin: I still say a couple of years in the service would have done you two boys a world of good. Goodnight. "
"Niles: Goodnight. You know, Frasier, Maris and I have had our difficulties before, but never anything this serious. I really feel terrible having her mad at me. It's times like this I wish I knew how to cry. "
"Frasier: Well, don't be embarrassed on my account, Niles. "
"Niles: No, no, it's not that, I'm just not someone who cries, it's not in my nature. When Maris's Uncle Lyle died, I had to shut my hand in the car door just to make a decent showing at the funeral. "
"Frasier: You're a complex little pirate, aren't you? Well, goodnight Niles. "
"Niles: Goodnight. "
"Daphne: Well, thank you again, Eric. I had a wonderful time. "
"Eric: Me too. "
"Daphne: Well, Goodnight. "
"Eric: Goodnight. "
"TO: "
"Daphne: I know we've only had a few dates, but I'm already exhibiting the three signs of a woman in "
"love: I can't stop thinking about him, I can't eat, and I bought myself all-new underwear "
"Martin: We gotta get her a girlfriend to talk to "
"Niles: I just got off the phone with Maris. She's in Arizona for the weekend. "
"Frasier: Why? "
"Niles: Well, she said she was so shattered by the experience she had to fly to her favorite spa to contemplate the future of our marriage from a mud bath. "
"Daphne: Well, it'll probably be good for Mrs. Crane. Eric thinks the earth is very grounding. "
"Niles: Eric, Eric, Eric Must everything always be about Eric? "
"Frasier: Niles. May I suggest that when Maris returns, you both invest some time in some intensive couples' therapy. There's a Reichian group... "
"Martin: Oh, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Look, all Maris needs to know is that you love her. Buy her some flowers, fix her a nice romantic dinner when she gets back, that's enough to make any woman forgive you. "
"Niles: You really think that will work? "
"Martin: If it didn't, you wouldn't be here "
"Niles: Well, I'd be willing to try, but it's impossible. Our cook walked out in sympathy with Maris. "
"Daphne: Well, I could help you prepare something. I have a late date with Eric... -a. An elderly Aunt Erica, but I could come over early and have everything ready by the time Mrs. Crane arrives. "
"Niles: Well, thank you, Daphne. "
"Daphne: Now, what do you think Mrs. Crane would like for dinner? "
"Niles: Oh, you have free reign. Just bear in mind she can't have shellfish... poultry, red meat, saturated fats, nitrates, wheat, starch, sulfites, MSG or dairy. Did I say nuts? "
"Frasier: Oh, I think that's implied "
"Time: 10"
":30) "
"then:] "
"Niles: Come in Daphne, and warm yourself by the fire. How did you get so wet? "
"Daphne: One of your trees blew down in your driveway. I had to walk the last hundred yards. I must say, you have a beautiful home. "
"Niles: Oh, well thank you. Actually, it was in Maris's family for four generations. When I was an mere intern I used to drive through these hills, never dreaming that one day I'd live in one of these great mansions. Then one afternoon, there was Maris, looking so helpless, banging on the gates with her little fists and a tire iron. "
"Daphne: They'd locked her in? "
"Niles: No, no, that was much later. No, this time she was returning from the antique mart with a rare bell jar once owned by Sylvia Plath, when the gates failed to open. So naturally I stopped to offer my assistance, and as our hands touched there was a sudden spark of electricity, then as if by magic the gates parted before us, and we took it as a sign. "
"Daphne: You knew you were meant to be together. "
"Niles: Yes. We were married just three short years later. "
"Daphne: Look at this, it's beautiful "
"Niles: It's a Glockenspiel. We bought it on our honeymoon in Zürich. I brought it down from the attic to remind Maris of better times. It used to play beautiful music, and now it doesn't. How's that for irony? Well, let's get you into some dry clothes, so you can get started on dinner, and we can get you home in time for your date "
"Niles: Daphne? What is it? "
"Daphne: Nothing. "
"Niles: No, no, it's definitely something. I'm a psychiatrist, I can read the signs. "
"Daphne: Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't want to spoil your reunion with Mrs. Crane, but... Eric broke up with me. "
"Niles: He did? "
"Daphne: Yes. He said he couldn't commit to me and his music. He had to stay focused. I knew it was an excuse - I've heard his music He must have another girl. "
"Niles: Well, he's a fool, Daphne, and if he can't appreciate you then you're better off without him. "
"Daphne: Right now, I'm not so sure, but thank you, Dr. Crane. "
"Niles: Niles Crane. Oh, Maris "
"Niles: Where are you? What do you mean you can't come home? Well, it's not that bad a storm "
"Niles: Oh Maris, I really think you should come home. No, no, well of course I don't want you traveling if it's not safe. Yes, yes, I understand. I'll see you tomorrow. [puts phone down] Well, it seems like it's just the two of us. "
"Daphne: You mean Mrs. Crane won't be coming? "
"Daphne: Oh my, there goes the electricity. What do we do now? "
"TO: "
"Martin: No, no, the storm's really bad. You shouldn't be driving in it anyway. No, you just spend the night there. Right, goodnight, Daphne. "
"Frasier: You told her to spend the night? "
"Martin: Yeah, what's the problem? "
"Frasier: Well, you know how Niles feels about her. "
"Martin: Oh, relax. It's just one of Niles's little crushes. "
"Frasier: Oh, I suppose you're right. Niles is harmless enough. Besides, he'd never try anything with Maris in the house. "
"Martin: Oh, Maris never made it back. She's stuck in Arizona. "
"Frasier: I've gotta get Daphne out of there "
"Martin: Why? "
"Frasier: Why? My God, it's a recipe for disaster You've got a vulnerable woman and an unstable man in a gothic mansion on a rainy night The only thing missing is someone shouting 'Heathcliff' across the moors "
"Martin: Wait for me "
"Frasier: Oh, Dad, Dad, you're not coming "
"Martin: Yes, I am "
"Frasier: No, you're not "
"Martin: I am "
"TO: "
"Daphne: Oh, Dr. Crane, you play beautifully "
"Niles: Thank you. "
"Daphne: I found this in the upstairs guest room, I hope it's alright. "
"Niles: I-I thought you were going to put on some of Maris's clothes. You know, something bulky from her wool collection. "
"Daphne: Well yeah, I was, but she's quite a bit smaller than me. This is all I could find that fit. Should I go look for something else? "
"Niles: No - yes - no... [sits down on the piano keys, then stands back up] oh, you know er... No, the important thing is that it's big enough, and warm enough, and sssssilky enough, [strokes it a third time] and... I have to make a phone call. "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Hello, this is Dr. Frasier Crane. I'm listening. "
"Niles: Frasier? Frasier I'm having a little crisis here. Actually a large crisis. It's no time to screen calls... Damn "
"TO: "
"Martin: This is stupid. "
"Frasier: It is not. "
"Martin: Look, nothing's going to happen between them anyway. "
"Frasier: What if it does? He's my brother and he loves his wife Now, now, I know, I know their marriage is not exactly everyone's cup of tea. But on some twisted, bizarre level it seems to work for them. If Niles ever did anything to hurt to his marriage, he's the one who'd suffer. He's my brother and I won't let him suffer "
"Martin: Hey, slow down You're going to miss the turn onto Roosevelt. "
"Frasier: Dad, I let you come along strictly on the agreement that you would not give directions. "
"Martin: I'm not giving directions, I'm just telling you which way's faster. "
"Frasier: Roosevelt'll add ten minutes. "
"Martin: In sunshine. In rain it's faster "
"Frasier: Oh what, spatial relationships change when it rains? "
"Martin: No, you've just got better traction on Roosevelt. Of course, you wouldn't have to worry about that if you'd gotten all- weather tires like I told you to, but no, you had to have the fancy German thing... "
"TO: "
"Niles: We'd better make this last, this is all that's left of the wood. Oh no, don't worry, if this runs out there's an antique sideboard in the drawing room that I think is reproduction. Oh. It's Eric, isn't it? "
"Daphne: I don't know why I'm being so silly. We weren't together long enough for anything to really happen. "
"Niles: Sometimes the strongest feelings come from the promise of what might happen. Just the anticipation is enough to make all the little hairs on your neck stand on end. "
"Daphne: Dr. Crane... "
"Niles: Yes, Daphne? "
"Daphne: We're losing the fire. "
"Niles: No we're not, it's burning with the heat of a thousand suns "
"Daphne: But it's down to its last embers "
"Niles: Well then... I'll put some wood on it "
"TO: "
"Martin: You flooded it. You had to keep pumping gas and now you flooded it. "
"Frasier: Dad, you cannot flood a fuel-injected engine. Oh, this so maddening. We're so close to the house, I can see the gargoyles "
"Martin: If we'd have taken Roosevelt... "
"Frasier: We'd be stuck on Roosevelt "
"Martin: You never can admit it when you made a mistake, could you? "
"Frasier: Oh that is it, just call the auto club, I'm gonna make a dash for it. "
"Martin: You'll make better time if you take the shortcut by the side of the fountain Well, same to you "
"TO: "
"Daphne: I suppose I just fall in love too fast. The minute I feel that spark, I just give my heart away. "
"Niles: Daphne, you must stop being so hard on yourself. What you see as a fault is also your greatest gift - to be so open, warm and loving. "
"Daphne: You're so kind, Dr. Crane. I'm glad we ended up like this tonight. "
"Niles: So am I. "
"Daphne: It's just so nice to be with a man you feel so comfortable with. I feel very close to you. "
"Niles: I feel very close to you too, Daphne. You know it's easy being someone you feel close to, when you feel close to someone... who's so close. "
"Daphne: Dr. Crane, your Glockenspiel has sprung to life "
"Niles: Oh, the clock "
"Niles: My God, it hasn't run like this in years Maris will be delighted... Maris. "
"Daphne: You really love her, don't you? "
"Niles: You know, I do. Love is a funny thing, isn't it? Sometimes it's exciting and passionate. Sometimes it's something else. Something... comfortable and familiar. That newly-exfoliated little face staring up at you across the breakfast table... sharing a laugh together when you see someone wearing white after Labor Day. "
"Daphne: I hope some day some man will feel that way about me. "
"Niles: Oh... Daphne, don't worry. You are a very special person, and some day a man worthy of you will come along... just as soon as the gods create him. "
"Daphne: That's the loveliest thing anyone's ever said to me. Thank you, Dr. Crane. You're a good friend. "
"Frasier: STOOOOOO-OOOP STOOOOOP "
"Niles: Frasier "
"Frasier: My God, have you two gone mad? You'll regret this for the rest of your lives "
"Niles: What are you talking about? "
"Frasier: Well, the two of you here alone, the fire, the candlelight, the nightie "
"Daphne: Dr. Crane, you didn't think that Dr. Crane and I were... Dr. Crane You have some nerve to imply that your brother would do anything so deplorable Why, just moments ago he made a beautiful speech about how much he loves his wife, how he cherishes her excruciating little face, and how they laugh at white people "
"Daphne: That didn't sound right. "
"Niles: Close enough. "
"Frasier: I'm sorry, Daphne, I didn't mean to suggest that, I didn't try to imply that... "
"Daphne: Well then, exactly what was it you wanted us to stop doing? "
"Frasier: I... wanted you to stop standing here in silence. A night like this calls for music Daphne, please, some wine for all of us. Niles, join me at the piano, please. "
"Frasier: Are you sure everything's alright? "
"Niles: Absolutely. Frasier, my Glockenspiel is working again "
"then: "
"Frasier: Shall we? "
"Time: 22"

"A: KACL Radio Station. "
"Frasier: Just remember Angela, cosmetic surgery is only a superficial solution. You can lift your eyelids, but it can't lift that little cloud of pessimism that hovers over you. Thank you for your call. So okay Roz, who's our next caller? "
"Frasier: Roz? Perhaps this would be a good time to go to commercial break. We'll be right back after these messages. "
"Roz: Frasier? Whoa Hi. "
"Frasier: A little disturbing, looking in the booth and seeing no one there, isn't it? "
"Roz: I'm sorry, but I was up in the newsroom, trying to find out if they've announced the nominations for the SeaBeas yet. "
"Frasier: Oh, I forgot. Are those coming out today? "
"Roz: You forgot? They're only the biggest award in Seattle radio "
"Frasier: Well, I suppose it's the difference in our ages, but I don't find myself getting excited about... well, much of anything anymore. "
"Noel: Congratulations, guys. "
"Frasier: YES Yes, we got a nomination "
"Roz: Who did you hear it from? "
"Noel: Oh, I haven't heard anything, I was just congratulating you on doing a great show. If anyone deserves a nomination, you guys do. "
"Frasier: Get out, Noel. "
"Noel: Okay, catch you later. "
"Frasier: Well I... I guess I'm a little more excited than I let on. Well, it'll be a big feather in my cap to win this, first year in radio and all that? "
"Roz: Are you kidding? I've been in this business for ten years, I've never produced a show that got nominated for anything. Hello? Oh hi, Millie. You're kidding. You're kidding Oh, you're kidding, that's great Thanks, bye. "
"Frasier: We got the nomination "
"Roz: No, Millie in Promotions is getting married "
"Frasier: DAMN IT, ROZ "
"B: Cafe Nervosa. "
"Niles: And then she said she'd been seeing someone else. She couldn't keep living a lie. I was dumbfounded. I mean, what about everything we'd gone through together, didn't that mean anything to her? "
"Frasier: Niles, a patient has a right to change therapists. "
"Bebe: Frasier Thank God. "
"Frasier: Bebe, what are you doing here? "
"Bebe: What kind of agent would I be if I weren't the first to tell you that you've been nominated for a 1994 SeaBea "
"Frasier: I WAS NOMINATED I WAS NOMINATED "
"Frasier: Well, I was. "
"Bebe: Yes. You, Frasier Crane M.D., PhD, S-T-U-D, are the man of the hour. Bebe Glaser, Frasier's agent. "
"Niles: Dr. Niles Crane, Frasier's brother. "
"Bebe: You're not a psychiatrist too? "
"Niles: Yes. "
"Bebe: Oh, please If I'm ever to have a breakdown, let me have it now Double-double decaf, to go. "
"Frasier: So, this, ah, this is quite a surprise, you know. Actually I'd, ah, forgotten that the nominations were coming out today. "
"Bebe: Oh, isn't he precious? You must be very proud of Frasier. "
"Niles: Well actually... no. This nomination is just one more signpost on the low road of celebrity which my brother has chosen for himself. "
"Frasier: Well, that's not sibling rivalry rearing its vicious little green snout? "
"Niles: Absolutely not. I'm still in the minority who still believes that psychiatry is a noble profession that is tarnished by such things as popularity contests, not to mention a bouncy little radio program. "
"Bebe: I bet you two had wicked little hair-pulling fights when you were tots. "
"Niles: Yes, well. This has been delightful, but I really must run. I'm due at my sexual addiction group, and I don't like to leave them alone for too long. "
"Roz: Frasier? "
"Frasier: Roz "
"Roz: Frasier, Frasier, Frasier "
"Frasier: Roz, Roz, Roz "
"Roz: We did it "
"Frasier: I know Come and sit down. You know, I've never really won anything before. Although back in prep school, the Existentialist Club once named me 'Most Likely To Be.' "
"Roz: You want to hear the greatest part? I've already got a date for the ceremony - Brad MacNamara. "
"Frasier: The Channel Eight reporter? “Television's Most Handsome Man.” "
"Roz: Yes. You know, for months he wouldn't give me the time of day, but one nomination and he knew who I was. "
"Bebe: Who are you? "
"Roz: I'm Roz Doyle. Frasier's producer. "
"Bebe: Oh, yes that's right, I've seen you bring him coffee. By the way, would you mind getting mine? "
"Frasier: I'd better get myself on the ball here, I've got a lot to do. "
"Bebe: Oh, not really, darling. I've already got your tux, rented you a limo and your tickets will be waiting for you at the door. "
"Frasier: Well... seems the only thing you haven't taken care of is finding me a date. "
"Bebe: Your subtlety floors me, I'd love to. I am thrilled, thrilled, thrilled for you both. I've got to run. Two of my other clients weren't nominated and I have to tell them what a worthless award this is. "
"TO: "
"C: Frasier's Apartment. "
"Frasier: Daphne, you may not be aware of this, but there is a special secret to opening a bottle of champagne, especially a fine French champagne as unprepossessing as this one – two hundred dollars a bottle. In order to prevent spillage, one does not simply twist out the cork. Instead, one holds the cork stationary, you see, and then gives the bottle three easy turns. One... "
"Frasier: OH, GOD Oh no, get some glasses "
"Frasier: Eddie, get away from there, you mangy little cur Oh, Lord. Oh well, that wasn't too bad, I believe we've salvaged most of it. "
"Martin: I'd say this calls for a toast. To my number one son. Congratulations on your first nomination for... well, anything. Frasier, I'm proud of you. "
"Frasier: Thanks, dad. Means a lot to me. "
"Daphne: Mmm. Oh, this champagne is delicious. "
"Frasier: Mmm. It's quite exquisite, isn't it? Dad, what do you think? "
"Martin: I was in the mood for something domestic. "
"Daphne: You know, I must say, Dr. Crane, it's awfully nice that, although I'm an employee here, you include me in all the family celebrations. "
"Frasier: Well Daphne, there's never been any doubt that I, I think of you as my equal in every way. "
"Daphne: Oh, I'll get it. "
"Frasier: Oh, would you? "
"Daphne: Would you like me to announce your visitor? "
"Frasier: Oh, just answer the door "
"Daphne: Oh, hello Roz. "
"Roz: Daphne. "
"Martin: Roz "
"Roz: Hey. "
"Daphne: Congratulations. "
"Roz: Oh, thanks. You know, I couldn't believe it myself. Brad MacNamara "
"Frasier: Roz, I believe she was referring to your SeaBea nomination? "
"Daphne: No, I meant Brad MacNamara. Oh, do you think he wears any pants under that desk? "
"Roz: Not on my TV. "
"Frasier: Girls, can we just cut out the pajama party, please? "
"Roz: Hello, Mr. C. "
"Martin: Hey Roz, how's my girlfriend? "
"Roz: Well, she's nominated. "
"Daphne: How about a glass of champagne? Apparently it's French and unprepossessing. "
"Frasier: Oh Daphne, save your breath. It could come out of a box and Roz would have a glass of it. "
"Daphne: You know, I must say, I am so proud of you, Roz, being recognized in a male-dominated industry. It's one more step forward for working women. You're a credit to our gender. "
"Roz: Well, thank you Daphne. Oh, that reminds me, do you have a push-up bra I could borrow? "
"Daphne: I'll go and look. "
"Roz: Thanks. I'm sorry to barge in like this, but I had to show you this, Frasier. [retrieves a piece of newspaper from her bag] I've got a friend over at “Broadcast Magazine” who sent me a copy. It's a full-page ad. "
"Frasier: “Wendy Ashiro wishes to thank the members of the voting committee for her nomination, and hopes they consider her for the award.” This is nothing but shameless self- promotion. It's in very bad taste. "
"Roz: I know. What are we gonna put in our ad? "
"Martin: Wendy Ashiro's up against you for this award? Oh, I like her, she's a cutie. "
"Frasier: You're not suggesting we put our own ad in this thing? "
"Roz: Frasier, we're falling behind. Mike Sanchez has already sent out tapes of his show. "
"Martin: Mike Sanchez? Oh, I like him. "
"Roz: And who knows what Fletcher Grey's doing? "
"Martin: Fletcher Grey? "
"Frasier: THANK YOU, DAD Well, all right, I – just as long as it's tasteful and understated. "
"Roz: Great. I'll call my friend, and have him work something up for us. "
"Frasier: No, wait a minute, wait a minute, we really want to stand out, why run another boring old ad? We should do something different, something unique. "
"Roz: Hey, I heard last year’s winner threw a big cocktail party. "
"Frasier: Okay, okay, we could do that, but we should do something else, something to keep our names in their minds. You know what I mean? Uh, I know. Personalized gifts, uh, from oh, the new Tiffany's catalogue. "
"Roz: That's good. That's it. "
"Frasier: I saw the most incredible cigarette cases in here. "
"Roz: No, no. No cigarette cases, it sends out a bad message. "
"Frasier: Oh, yeah. "
"Roz: Ooh, how about a silver flask? "
"Frasier: No, we've already got your vote, Roz. "
"Martin: Hold on a minute. Look, I may not know anything about show- business, but when you start sending out gifts to people who can do something for you, that's called bribery. "
"Frasier: It's a simple “Thank you” for a nomination. "
"Martin: Well, I'm glad to hear that. Because if I had to give somebody a gift to get an award, it's not worth having. Might as well just go on down to the trophy store and buy one yourself. "
"Roz: I really want that award. "
"Frasier: Me too "
"Roz: Get that catalogue "
"A: The Seattle Broadcast Awards. "
"Martin: Well, you coming in or not? "
"Frasier: Dad, this is a big moment for me. I want to drink it in. "
"Martin: Me, too. Where's the bar? "
"Daphne: Hey, not so fast. Me shoes are killing me. I hate these shoes, I should never have let that salesgirl talk me into getting them. "
"Martin: They look real good on you, though. "
"Daphne: You think so? "
"Peterson: Dr. Crane? Bob Peterson, voting committee. [they shake hands] "
"Frasier: Hi, Bob. "
"Peterson: Look, I just wanted to wish you good luck tonight. "
"Frasier: Thank you, thank you. "
"Peterson: Oh, and uh, thanks for the bathrobe. "
"Frasier: Oh, it's nothing. People get out of the shower, they're cold. "
"Woman: Dr. Crane. Love the watch. "
"Frasier: It's nothing, really. It's a pretty good likeness of me though, isn't it? "
"Daphne: Can we please sit down? I have got to sit down. [she sits at the nearest table] "
"Frasier: Daphne, we're at table eight. This isn't our table. "
"Daphne: It is now. "
"Martin: Hey, isn't that Fletcher Grey? "
"Frasier: Oh yes, I believe it is. "
"Martin: Oh boy, you really got your work cut out for you here. Let me tell you, that guy's a class act. I been listening to him for twenty years. You know, I don't usually do this, but I'm going over to shake his hand. [leaves table as Roz enters] "
"Roz: Hey, guys. "
"Frasier: Oh, Roz. There's my fellow nominee. "
"Roz: Frasier, those gifts were such a great idea. Everybody's talking about them. "
"Frasier: I know. Did you see the valet parking board? Half the key chains there are ours "
"Roz: Look, Frasier, this is a very big night for me, so please, PLEASE don't spoil it by making fun of who I brought. "
"Frasier: I thought you were bringing Brad MacNamara? "
"Roz: Well I was, but he got called out on a story at the last minute. Some hospital went up in flames. Do you know anyone who has worse luck than I do? "
"Noel: Hi, Dr. Crane. "
"Frasier: Oh, hi Noel. Noel Shempsky's your date? "
"Roz: Mmm-hmm. "
"Noel: A tip, Dr. Crane? If you're ever nominated again, there's a metered parking block three blocks away. They don't check after six Oh, here are the car keys so you can drive us home. "
"Roz: I wish I did. "
"Noel: Hi. I'm Noel. "
"Daphne: Nice to meet you. Can you rub my feet? "
"Frasier: Daphne "
"Niles: Good evening, everybody. "
"Frasier: Oh, hi Niles. Listen, thank you so much for coming. I know how you feel about this award, and about coming downtown after dark. "
"Niles: Don't be silly. You're my brother and I wouldn't miss a gala affair like this. Hello, Daphne. "
"Daphne: Can you rub my feet? "
"Niles: Yes. "
"Frasier: Niles. So, where's Maris? "
"Niles: Well, we were just getting ready to leave the house, when Maris got a glimpse of herself in the hall mirror... "
"Frasier: Niles, at the end of this story, will I roll my eyes? "
"Niles: I did. "
"Frasier: Well then, just skip it. Listen, get me a scotch, will you? "
"Martin: That Fletcher Grey, he's aces. Would you believe he remembered me from 1968? "
"Frasier: No "
"Martin: Yeah, I was working on a murder case he was covering. He just looked at me and said, 'Hey, you're the guy who found the head.' He's been nominated for this award eleven times and he's never won it. "
"Frasier: Really? Jeez, I didn't know that. "
"Daphne: Well, I'm afraid he's just going to have to lose again, right Dr. Crane? "
"Martin: Well, if he does you can always cheer him up by sending him something nice from your little gift shop. "
"Fletcher: Dr. Crane? "
"Frasier: Fletcher Grey "
"Fletcher: Been meaning to come over and wish you luck. Even though I don't think you need it. "
"Frasier: Well, that's very kind. I, I hardly think I have a chance against you tonight. "
"Fletcher: Well you know, I hope you're right? I'd really love to win it this time. Eleven losses in a row, it's starting to get a little embarrassing. "
"Frasier: Oh, don't be silly. You'd have to lose fifteen, sixteen times before you'd feel the least bit ashamed. "
"Fletcher: Would you believe I even considered campaigning for it this year? You know, sending out gifts, throwing one on those parties. Bet you'd have something to say on your radio program about someone who's THAT self-absorbed. "
"Martin: I bet he could do a whole hour on it. "
"Grey: Fletcher dear, they're starting to serve the salads. "
"Fletcher: Oh, Mom. I'm sixty years old, and I'm still her little boy. Dr. Crane, I'd like you to meet my mother, Hannah. "
"Frasier: What a pleasure, Hannah. Nice to meet you. "
"Fletcher: Mom just flew in from Scottsdale. This is her eleventh year. "
"Grey: I hope he wins it this time. It's getting harder and harder to get on that plane. "
"Fletcher: Mom, why don't you go back to the table before your legs swell up? I'll get you another Pink Lady. No, no mom, over there. "
"Bebe: Sorry I've been detained, dear. "
"Frasier: Oh hi, Bebe. "
"Bebe: Civilization will not advance one iota until they start putting more toilets in the ladies room. "
"Frasier: Oh, thank you Niles. "
"Bebe: Some champagne. "
"Noel: Ah, a diet root beer? "
"Bebe: I have to tell you that the buzz in line was that all those lovely gifts you've been sending have really paid off. It looks like you're in a neck-and-neck race with Fletcher Grey, that wrinkled old war... ...rt. Hello, Mr. Crane. You're even more handsome than the last time I saw you. If I were twenty years older they couldn't keep me away from you. "
"Martin: That's why I keep this cane. "
"Keith: Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Would everybody please take their seats? I'm Keith Bishop, and I'd like to welcome you to the fifteenth annual SeaBea awards. Assisting me tonight in handing out the awards is Miss SeaBea 1994, Tawny Van Deusen. "
"Frasier: Listen Roz, I'm starting to feel uncomfortable about all the campaigning we did. Did you know Fletcher Grey has been nominated eleven times and never won? He didn't lift a finger to win this thing. "
"Roz: Frasier, don't worry about him. Besides, he can win it next year. "
"Keith: Before we start this evening’s program, I'd like to take this moment to make a very sad announcement. I just found out moments ago that the dean of Seattle radio, my mentor Fletcher Grey, will be retiring this year. "
"All: Awww... "
"Keith: Take a bow, Fletcher. "
"Keith: Well, we're gonna start things off with a bang. The award for “Outstanding Achievement For Informational Programming in Radio...” "
"Roz: That's us, that's us "
"Keith: Whoops. Can't see a thing without my glasses. "
"Frasier: You know, Fletcher Grey really deserves this award. If we win, can't we just not accept it? "
"Roz: Listen, Frasier I have waited ten years to get this award and if I have to crawl over Fletcher Grey's mother to get it, I'll DO IT "
"Frasier: Roz, I... I've never seen you like this before. "
"Roz: It isn't pretty, is it? "
"Keith: The "
"nominations: “Community Forum,” Wendy Ashiro, talent, Mike Freedman, producer. "
"Keith: “Consumer Update,” Mike Sanchez, talent, T.J. “Chester” Nuevo, producer. "
"Keith: “The Frasier Crane Show,' Dr. Frasier Crane, talent, Roz Doyle, producer. "
"Keith: “Fletcher "
"Grey: From Where I Sit,” Fletcher Grey, talent, Fletcher Grey, producer. "
"Keith: And the envelope, please? "
"Frasier: If we win this thing, they're gonna lynch us "
"Roz: So what? At least everyone will see my dress. "
"Keith: Well... this is a first. It seems we have a tie. "
"Frasier: Good. We can share it with Fletcher. "
"Roz: I don't want to share it I'm already sharing it with you "
"Keith: And the winners are... Wendy Ashiro and Mike Sanchez "
"Frasier: What?? "
"Roz: What "
"Grey: What? "
"TO: "
"B: Time Lapse. "
"Martin: Well, the party's over. Are you coming home? "
"Frasier: No, dad. "
"Martin: Then I'll guess we'll just go on without you. "
"Frasier: Fine with me. "
"Martin: Listen, Frasier. I don't agree with the way you went about it, but I'm still sorry that you lost. It's never easy to lose. "
"Frasier: Thanks, dad. "
"Martin: Of course, if you were to have joined some organized sports when you were a kid, when the lessons of winning and losing could have been learned at an early age, you might have... "
"Frasier: DAD "
"Martin: All right. Sorry, wrong time. We'll talk about it tomorrow, over breakfast. Okay, Daphne. Let's get you home, and soak your feet in some hot Epsom Salts. "
"Daphne: Oh, I have the life of a princess. "
"Noel: Don't feel bad, Roz. it's an honor just to get a nomination. "
"Roz: Will you stop saying that? "
"Noel: Okay. I'm leaving. "
"Roz: Oh Noel, I'm sorry, I'm just despondent. [he waits, expectantly] ...No no, go ahead. "
"Frasier: ROZ "
"Roz: Noel? Noel? I'm sorry. Thank you. I'll see you at work, on Monday? "
"Fletcher: How you guys doing? "
"Roz: Well, I've been better. "
"Fletcher: You know, when you feel this sting of losing, you have to realize that it all boils down to the fact that it's not about awards. It's not about accolades. It's about a body of work. If you can look at yourself in a mirror and say you've done a good job, that's all that matters. If you can do that, let the awards fall where they may. "
"Frasier: Wow. All those nominations, nothing to show for it, he still walks out of here with his head held high and a smile on his face. "
"Roz: I'm never going to get nominated for a SeaBea again "
"Frasier: Oh, come on Roz. "
"Roz: I mean it, I'm not "
"Frasier: Oh, no. "
"Roz: The world is full of winners and losers, and I'm just a loser "
"Frasier: Aw, I wouldn't be with you if you were a loser. Come on, we're a team. Look, before we're done, we're gonna win lots of these things. You and I are amigos, compadres, okay? Now listen, I am not gonna leave your side until I see a little smile on that face. "
"Tawny: Dr. Crane? I really love your show, and I was just wondering, would you like to have a drink with me? "
"Frasier: Do I see the beginning of a little smile? "
"Roz: Oh, go ahead. "
"Frasier: Thanks, Roz. "
"Frasier: So, it's a very interesting name you have. "
"Tawny: You mean Miss SeaBea? "
"Frasier: Well actually, I, er... yeah. "

"Frasier: To start off the second hour, I would like to depart from my usual format because I recently read a book that... well, it truly just knocked my mental socks off. It's called “The Menopausal Male,” and its author, the distinguished psychiatric scholar Dr. Helmut Bruga, has graciously agreed to join us today from his offices at the University of Washington. Dr. Bruga, guten tag. I've been an admirer of yours for a long time. "
"Bruga: Thank you. I enjoy your show as well. "
"Frasier: Really? "
"Bruga: Yes. Though I do not in most cases agree with your analysis. "
"Frasier: Back to your book. Now, we're all very familiar with the changes in the female menopause, but your research indicates... "
"Bruga: Excuse me, Dr. Crane. May I say hello to Roz? "
"Frasier: Yes, of course. "
"Bruga: Hello, Roz. "
"Roz: Hello, Dr. Bruga. "
"Frasier: Yes, your research indicates that the reproductive imperative is re-awakened in later life, when the man is... "
"Bruga: You have a very sensuous voice. "
"Frasier: ...Thank you. "
"Bruga: Not you, Roz. "
"Frasier: Yes well, back to male menopause. "
"Bruga: Would you perhaps like to go to a movie or something, maybe grab a bite? "
"Roz: Well, that would be very... "
"Roz: No. No, thank you very much. "
"Frasier: Well, our time has just flown by. Thank you for joining us, Dr. Bruga, and for so vividly proving your point. "
"Bruga: You will give Roz my number? "
"Frasier: Oh, I think Roz has your number "
"Daphne: Oh, hello, Dr. Crane. "
"Niles: Hello, Daphne. I hope I haven't come at a bad time. "
"Daphne: Well, your brother isn't home from work yet, and your father's out walking Eddie. "
"Niles: Oh, darn the luck. I, ah, I stopped by to drop this off. It's a necklace I bought for Maris, I was hoping to hide it here until her birthday. "
"Daphne: Well, I'm sure it'll be all right. Mind if I have a peek? "
"Niles: Not at all. "
"Daphne: Oh, my - emeralds. Your practice must be doing awfully well. Who'd have thought the mentally disturbed had this much money? "
"Niles: Would you like to try it on? "
"Daphne: Oh, I'd love to. If you don't think Mrs. Crane would mind. "
"Niles: Oh, certainly not. Maris is the soul of generosity. Just last week she donated all her old cocktail dresses to a homeless shelter. "
"Daphne: Oh, let me just get me hair out of the way. "
"Niles: All right, here we go... "
"Daphne: Oh, dear/OOH "
"Daphne: Oh, my. [puts hand down top and starts fishing for the necklace] Can you see them? "
"Niles: Oh yes, thank you. "
"Frasier: Hello, Niles. Whatever are you doing here? "
"Niles: I, um, bought an emerald necklace for Maris, and I needed some place to hide it for her birthday. "
"Frasier: Emeralds? Well, may I see it? "
"Niles: Not at the moment, no. "
"Frasier: Why not? "
"Daphne: It's down me blouse. "
"Frasier: I see. Well, I'm sure Maris will never think of looking for it there. "
"Daphne: It slipped down there when I was trying it on. I'll just go extract it. "
"Niles: Just call me butterfingers. "
"Frasier: Join a health club, Niles. "
"Martin: Hey, guys. "
"Niles: Hey, Dad. "
"Frasier: Oh, hi, Dad. "
"Martin: Well, Niles. What brings you by? "
"Niles: Uh, Maris's birthday. I'm hiding her gift here. "
"Martin: Oh, it's getting that time again, huh? Well, I guess I'm gonna have to get her something. It's too bad, I just got back from the hardware store. Saw a great-looking ratchet set. "
"Frasier: As if there's anything left on her that needs tightening. "
"Frasier: Oh Dad, no, no Not more duct tape "
"Martin: Yeah. I gotta repair a little split in the old throne here. You gotta catch these rips early, or they look like hell. "
"Frasier: You know, Dad, instead of repairing this old relic all the time, why don't we just bring the Eames down here? "
"Martin: Ah no, that thing's too fancy for me, I just need a comfortable place to park my fanny. "
"Frasier: How about Florida? "
"Martin: I heard that. "
"Frasier: God, you know, when you think of all the care I put into decorating my home, only to have it mocked by this atrocity. "
"Niles: The bottom line is, it is your home. Why don't you just make him get rid of it? "
"Frasier: Yes well, it's not as simple as all that. I mean, one would have to find the appropriate moment. I mean, Dad does have his feelings, and one should consider those, and he has quite an attachment to this little chair... "
"Niles: You're afraid to stand up to him, aren't you? "
"Frasier: Oh, like you're not. "
"Niles: Well, at least I don't have to live with something unattractive. "
"Frasier: Oh Niles, Niles, I'm just having some fun with you. Actually, I think Maris is rather attractive - in a, a minimalist sort of way. Oh, forget it, I'm just upset about the chair. "
"Niles: You know, Frasier, there is a perfectly sound psychological basis for getting rid of this chair. "
"Frasier: Oh, really? Well, enlighten me, doctor. "
"Niles: With pleasure. Originally, Dad needed it to bridge the transition from his old apartment to life here with you. But as with all transitional objects - be they a teddy bear, be they a thumb, be they a blankie, be they a chair... "
"Frasier: Stop saying “Be they” "
"Niles: The point is, there comes a time when the healthy thing is to put these security objects aside and reassert your independence. "
"Frasier: Yes, of course. So what you're saying is that if I should, say, go down to the store and buy Dad a new chair, throw this one in the trash heap, I wouldn't be doing it for me, I'd be doing it for him. "
"Niles: Yes. And it would be a nice payback for the day he used your blankie to clean his service revolver. Oops, I'm sorry, our time is up. "
"TO: "
"Niles: Dear God, Frasier, we've stumbled upon Hell's waiting room. "
"Frasier: All right, now this is not a moment for the faint of heart. We're treading a thin line here, Niles. We've got to find something that compliments my decor as well as fulfills Dad's requirements. "
"Frasier: Oh, dear God. Can you imagine anyone would have something like that in their living room? "
"Niles: It looks like someone upholstered it in golf pants. "
"Frasier: Excuse me, perhaps you could help us here. "
"Salesman: Yeah, perhaps. "
"Frasier: Well, we're looking for a chair. "
"Salesman: We got 'em. "
"Frasier: Wait, wait-wait-wait "
"Niles: Ideally, we're looking for something with the presence of a Mies van der Rohe and the playful insouciance of an early Le Corbusier. "
"Salesman: This one vibrates. "
"Frasier: Yes well, perhaps you could direct us to your recliners, preferably one in suede. "
"Salesman: People seem to like this “Lazy-guy.” "
"Frasier: “Lazy-guy.” I wonder what they call the deluxe model? The “Hopeless Slack-Ass?” "
"Niles: Oh, hey. Well, what about this one over here? [points to leather recliner] "
"Frasier: You know, I-I hate to admit it, but that would not look altogether hideous in my living room. "
"Salesman: Have a seat. This one's got Swedish massage. "
"Niles: Oh, ha, no thank you. "
"Frasier: Go ahead, Niles. Try it out. "
"Salesman: I'll fire it up for you. "
"Niles: That won't be necessary. I like to sit in my chair, I don't really like to vibrate very much. No, thank you any- Wha-hey.... ahh... ooh... "
"Salesman: It also has shiatsu. "
"Niles: OHHH... I never knew a chair could be this satisfying... I never knew that anything could. I want it. "
"Frasier: Right, Niles. I'm sure it would fit right in with all of Maris's 18th-century antiques. "
"Niles: Well then, I'll just rent it an apartment and visit it on the side. "
"Salesman: So what do you think? Why don't you have a try yourself? "
"Frasier: Well, I don't really think that's necessary. You see, I'm buying it for my father.. "
"Niles: No, no. You've got to sit in it. "
"Frasier: And who knows about other people's tastes.. "
"Niles: You can't make a decision before you sit in it. "
"Frasier: Something seems as if it's not quite right, really, I just... whoa... OH, MOMMY "
"Frasier: Eddie? What is the matter with him? "
"Daphne: He saw your father's chair was gone, and he's afraid it means your father's gone too. I think he suspects foul play. "
"Frasier: Oh, stop it If I had stuck Dad's feet into a bucket of cement and thrown him into Puget Sound, you would have been the tiny little splash that followed him "
"Frasier: Oh. that must be Leo. Wait'll you see this. "
"Frasier: Come on in. "
"Leo: Dr. Crane, make way. "
"Frasier: All right, now just be careful now, Leo. Watch the furniture and the walls. "
"Leo: Excuse me, but I happen to be a professional. I take a lot of pride in my work, and I would never- "
"Leo: Whoa... how'd that get there? Hey look, at least I didn't lose my license this time, right? "
"Frasier: All right, all right. Quickly, quickly. I'm sure Beavis will start to wonder where you are. "
"Daphne: Actually Leo, as long as you're here, we're having a problem with a leaky faucet in the sink. "
"Leo: And where would that be? "
"Daphne: In the kitchen, dear. "
"Leo: Hey, that wasn't a dumb question. You got bathrooms too, dontcha? "
"Daphne: None that you'll be going anywhere near. "
"Daphne: Oh, Dr Crane, it's lovely. Well, I thought the other one was nice, but this is smashing. "
"Frasier: Well, try it out, try it out. And it has a little surprise. "
"Daphne: This is comfy. Although it's a little on the soft side. I prefer... Hello... ohh... ohh... ohh... this is enough to make me give up me search for a meaningful relationship. "
"Frasier: Oh, quick, quick, that's Dad. Get out, get out, get out. "
"Daphne: Oh, all right. Just like a man – now you've had your fun, you don't care where I am "
"Martin: Hey, there. "
"Frasier: Hi, Dad. I've ah, got a little surprise for you. "
"Martin: What's that? "
"Frasier: It's your new easy chair. "
"Martin: Well... what do you know about that? Where's my old chair? "
"Frasier: It's down in the storage space. Come on, try this one out. "
"Martin: Oh look, I appreciate this, Frasier. But that - it, it... it really isn't me. "
"Frasier: Dad, Dad, you haven't even sat in it yet. Come on, come on, come on down, Martin Crane. "
"Martin: That's disgusting No, no look, Frasier, I'm sorry, but I'm a creature of habit and I think that I'd rather have my old chair back. "
"Frasier: Well Dad, but why? I mean this chair's a lot more comfortable than the old one, and it's, it's therapeutic as well. "
"Martin: I know. It's, I just never cared for leather, you know? You stick to it in the hot weather, you can't sit in it in your shorts, it makes my back sweat. Black's hot. I, I, I, I'm sorry, I just couldn't get used to this chair. "
"Frasier: All right Dad, fine. The important thing is that you lived with it for a full fifteen seconds. Leo "
"Daphne: Leo, we need you to bring Mr. Crane's chair back in here. "
"Leo: Ah, no can do, fish n'chips. Someone took it. "
"Martin: What? "
"Frasier: Are you saying that someone broke into my storage space and stole my father's chair? "
"Leo: Your storage space? "
"Frasier: Well, that's where I told you to put it. You did put it there, didn't you? "
"Leo: Oh, man. Not another day like last Tuesday. "
"Martin: Where's my chair, Leo? "
"Leo: I took it down to the dumpster, and someone snagged it. It was pretty bitchin', you know. I almost kept it myself. "
"Martin: You threw my chair away Are you happy now, it's gone "
"Frasier: Listen Leo, you have got to find that chair. I don't care what you have to do. Comb the entire building, search the neighborhood, just find my father’s chair "
"Leo: “Dump the chair,” “Get the chair,” “Find the chair,” what am I, "
"Frasier: YES "
"Leo: Oh, okay. "
"Daphne: Well, if no one's going to want this, we could put it in my room. [sees Frasier and Martin glaring at one another] Maybe later. You two talk it over. "
"Martin: Well, this couldn't have worked out any better for you, could it? You've been trying to get rid of that chair from the day I moved in here. "
"Frasier: Dad, you could at least show a little gratitude, I didn't do this for me, I did it for you. "
"Martin: Like hell "
"Frasier: Geez, you're acting like I lost the chair on purpose. "
"Martin: Hey, let me tell you something. That chair was the only thing that made me feel comfortable in this house - that made me feel that maybe this was my home too. "
"Frasier: Oh, baloney Ever since you got here all I've tried to do is make you comfortable. I don't even know why I bothered. I mean, everybody knows Martin Crane doesn't like calfskin, he prefers duct tape "
"Frasier: And food crumbs There we are And let's have a little dribble of beer while we're at it Why not? There, that's delightful Oh, and let's not forget - to top it all off - just the slightest bit of dog hair "
"Martin: I suppose you're going to be throwing Eddie out by the dumpster next "
"Frasier: Oh Dad, I don't know why you’re carrying on this way. We are, after all, talking about a twenty-five year-old, broken-down chair. If you don't like this chair, I'll get you another one. Any chair you want "
"Martin: Really? Okay, I'll tell you what chair I want. I want the chair I was sitting in when I watched Neil Armstrong take his first step on the moon. And when the U.S. hockey team beat the Russians in the '80 Olympics. I want the chair I was sitting in the night you called me to tell me I had a grandson. I want the chair I was in all those nights, when your mother used to wake me up with a kiss after I'd fallen asleep in front of the television. You know, I still fall asleep in it. And every once in a while, when I wake up, I still expect your mother to be there, ready to lead me off to bed... Oh, never mind. It's only a chair. Come on, Eddie. "
"Roz: Hey, Fras How was your weekend? "
"Frasier: Hellish. "
"Roz: Great Let me tell you what happened to me. See I had this most incredible date Saturday night. It was really hot. So Sunday, I'm driving home... "
"Frasier: Sunday? "
"Roz: I told you, it was hot. So anyway, my car breaks down right in front of this church, and all the people are just coming out after the show... "
"Frasier: Service. "
"Roz: What? "
"Frasier: Churches don't have shows, they have services. "
"Roz: Can I finish my story? "
"Frasier: All right, all right. "
"Roz: Thank you. So, I walk up to the minister--is that all right? "
"Frasier: Mm-hmm. "
"Roz: And I ask him if I can use his phone. And he tells me my sweater's on inside out. One thing led to another, and we have a date tonight. Ministers aren't celibate, are they? Not that I don't love a challenge. "
"Frasier: You know Roz, maybe you should take a sick day sometime, call into the show yourself. "
"Roz: You're on the air. "
"Frasier: Good afternoon, Seattle. This is Dr. Frasier Crane. Now before I take my first caller, I'd like to make a personal appeal. Last Saturday, my father’s chair was taken from in front of the Elliott Bay Towers, and it's a runny split-pea green and mud-brown striped recliner with the occasional spot of stuffing popping out from underneath a strip of duct tape. Aas incredible as this may seem, I'm offering a handsome reward for its safe return. Thank you. And now Roz, who's on line one? "
"Roz: It's John... "
"TO: "
"Frasier: So remember Stephanie, a little emotional flexibility is a good thing. Just as the mighty oak snaps and falls in a windstorm, so the weeping willow bends and lives to see another day. Thank you for your call. So Roz, any update on the chair? "
"Roz: Oh yeah, the calls have been pouring in. "
"Frasier: Really? And what are they? "
"Roz: Well, so far it's been spotted at the top of the Space Needle, in the Governor’s Mansion, and a man on Lake Stevens said he saw it flying over his house, but he thought it was just a spaceship from a tacky planet. "
"Frasier: Funny stuff, people. Well, let's just go to commercial break so you all can chuckle through these words from Yukon Lumber. "
"Frasier: Ingrates I dedicate my life to clearing away their psychic debris and this is how they repay me. "
"Roz: Uh-huh. Uh-huh... I got it. He'll be there just as soon as the show's over, thank you so much. "
"Frasier: What? What is it? "
"Roz: Frasier, I found the chair. "
"Frasier: Oh, great. Oh, thank God. By tonight my dad will be safely back in his beer-stained, flea-infested, duct-taped recliner, adjusting his shorts with one hand and cheering on Jean-Claude van Damme with the other. Yes, it's quite a little piece of heaven I've carved out for myself, isn't it? "
"prophetic: eight years later, "
"TO: "
"Warren: Okay. Okay, that... that was nice. Um, but let's just remember there's a very fine line between good acting and hamming it up. Let's try it again. "
"Frasier: Excuse me? "
"Brown: Mrs. Warren, I can't find my moustache. "
"Olsen: I can't remember any of my lines, Mrs. Warren. Look, I'm really nervous. "
"Joey: Me, too. "
"Warren: Okay, people? People? Can I have you all over here for a second? "
"Frasier: Uh, Mrs. Warren...? "
"Warren: This isn't Broadway, it's junior high. There's no reason at all to be nervous. We're just going to go out there tonight in front of family and friends and have some fun, okay? "
"Warren: If one more thing goes wrong, I'm going to have to take my own life. "
"Frasier: Well, if I could just have a word with you... "
"Warren: I'm sorry, in forty-five minutes the curtain goes up on a very shaky production of “Ten Little Indians.” "
"Frasier: Ooh, “Ten Little Indians.” I thought I recognized the mise en scene. I did this play years ago. 'On the contrary, Major. Many a psychotic killer would appear to be quite normal. You see, you can never suspect that underneath that calm exterior there lies the heart of a maniac, ah-ha-ha.' Happens to be true, by the way. "
"Warren: Who are you? "
"Frasier: Oh, I'm Dr. Frasier Crane. "
"Frasier: From the radio? KACL Talk... well, never mind. Listen, someone told me that my chair would be here, and sure enough here it is, so I'll just get this out of your hair. "
"Warren: No, excuse me, but that doesn't go anywhere. Right now, this chair is the most entertaining thing on stage. "
"Frasier: Well, I'm sure that's quite true, but you see... "
"Warren: Don't worry about it, honey, just run along to the nurse’s office, I'm sure you'll be fine. They'll have you back here in no time I am so sick of being positive. "
"Frasier: Yes, but you see, you don't understand, this chair belongs to my father and I must return it to him... "
"Warren: Sir? You can have your chair back in two weeks. "
"Frasier: Yes, you don't understand, I'm in a very difficult position here. "
"Warren: DIFFICULT? You want difficult? I have a set that's falling apart, a leading man whose voice changed at precisely three o'clock this afternoon, AND MY NAME IS SPELLED WRONG IN THE PROGRAM See what I did there, Pomeroy? That's the kind of anger I need from you in the accusation scene. "
"Frasier: Listen, I'll give you two hundred dollars, you can get yourself a new chair. "
"Warren: Forget it. "
"Frasier: Listen, Mrs. Warren, I realize you are in an untenable position here, but I am speaking to you now from the heart. You see, by putting this chair into the trash, I have wounded my father. I realize it's just a chair to you, but to him it is a treasure trove of life memories that I have thoughtlessly discarded because I didn't like the way it looked in my living room. I have sacrificed heart and soul for form and function. Believe me, I am terribly ashamed of myself for that. This chair is the last, best chance to forge any kind of meaningful relationship with the only father I'll ever have "
"Warren: People, were you all listening to that? Because you can learn a lot from this man. That speech he just gave is a perfect example of the kind of hammy overacting I don't want to see out of ANY OF YOU FOR THIS ENTIRE RUN "
"Frasier: Now just hold on for a minute "
"Joey: Mrs. Warren? "
"Warren: What is it, Joey? "
"Joey: Bobby MacDuff just threw up backstage. "
"Warren: Perfect. My Dr. Armstrong has opening night jitters. "
"Joey: No, it's not jitters. It's stomach flu. He's in the nurse’s office. "
"Frasier: Oh well, what else can you do? You'll have to cancel the performance. Too bad. I'll just take this along with me. "
"Warren: I can't cancel, I have three hundred parents in their cars already. "
"Frasier: Well, I'm sure somehow the American theatre will survive. You can't do the show without Dr. Armstrong, he's too important to the plot. I know, that's the part I played. "
"Warren: You played Dr. Armstrong? "
"Frasier: Well, yes I... Oh, no-no-no-no-no, you're not thinking... "
"Warren: How badly do you want your chair? "
"Frasier: I-I'm sorry, it's out of the question "
"Warren: You know, it would be a real shame if something... "
"Warren: Ooh - happened to this chair. "
"Frasier: But it's been years. I hardly can remember any of the lines. "
"Warren: Then you'll fit right in "

"One: The Frasier Crane Show. "
"Frasier: Hello, Rachel. I'm listening. "
"Rachel: Oh, thanks for taking my call, Dr. Crane. Um, I'm involved in sort of a strange love triangle. "
"Frasier: "
"Rachel: You see, I recently married a widower. Now, Phil's a real good man, he's a kind man. But there's just one little problem. He insists on keeping an urn with his late wife's ashes on the dresser in our bedroom. "
"Frasier: That is a definite “Yikes.” "
"Rachel: See, I knew that wasn't normal. He says it is, but I knew it wasn't "
"Frasier: All right, Rachel, Rachel, now listen. Before you go off half-cocked, let's try to remember this is a very sensitive issue for your husband. Obviously those ashes mean a very great deal to him. And although I don't believe it's appropriate that he keep them in the bedroom, I suppose you could maybe move them to another room? "
"Rachel: Well, I guess I could try that. Maybe I'll move them into the guest room. Oops. "
"Frasier: Rachel, what happened? "
"Rachel: Oh... oh, nothing. I gotta run, Dr. Crane. I've got some vacuuming to do. "
"Frasier: Well, as Rachel helps Phil's wife off the floor, we have reached the end of our second hour. Now, we'll be right back after the news, so please join me again, Frasier Crane and my invaluable producer... ah... [ohmygod, what's her name? It's, it's...] "
"Roz: ROZ "
"Frasier: Roz KACL Talk radio, 780 AM. "
"Frasier: Roz, I'm so sorry. Your name was right there in front of me and I just couldn't put my finger on it. "
"Roz: Oh, forget about it. I already have. "
"Frasier: Well, it's been happening to me a lot lately. Last night I walked into the kitchen and I just stood there. I couldn't remember what I'd gone in there for. "
"Roz: Don't make yourself crazy over it, it's completely normal. Oh, by the way, you hair stylist called to confirm your appointment. "
"Frasier: I made an appointment with Timo? I don't remember that. "
"Roz: That's 'cause you didn't, I was just gas-lighting you. "
"Frasier: That is not funny "
"Roz: Oh, lighten up. Here, sign these. So aren't you gonna say it, or are you going to make me wait 'til the end of the day? "
"Frasier: Say what? "
"Roz: Happy birthday. "
"Frasier: It is not your birthday. Oh, God. Oh God, it is. Oh, oh Roz, I'm so sorry Let me take you out to lunch after work, okay? "
"Roz: You are so easy "
"Frasier: That's it. I'm outta here "
"Roz: Hey, wait, wait, wait. Aren't you forgetting something? "
"Frasier: No, I am not forgetting anything, thank you, Roz. "
"Roz: Okay. Well, can't blame a girl for trying. Five, four, three... "
"Roz: Two... "
"Frasier: We're back. "
"Two: Frasier's apartment. "
"Niles: Ten. "
"Martin: Fifteen-two. "
"Niles: No Dad, would you ask your dog to stop burrowing at my shoes? I'll have you know I had to wait six months to have these shipped for a little blind cobbler in Seville. "
"Martin: He won't stop until you scratch him behind the ear. "
"Niles: Oh, all right Eddie, all right. "
"Niles: You know, I'm beginning to this I have an affinity towards animals. "
"Frasier: Would either of you mind if I noodled at the piano for a bit? "
"Niles: Would it really stop you if we said “Yes?” "
"Frasier: Point well taken. "
"Frasier: That's strange. For the life of me, I can't remember what the next note is. I know this piece backwards and forwards. "
"Niles: Perhaps if you start at the end you'll have better luck. "
"Martin: Oh, come on Frasier. You know how it goes. It goes, “da dada da da, da dada...” "
"Frasier: Oh, thank you dad. Now it's perfectly clear. [tries once more, then gives up in disgust] "
"Martin: That was very nice, son. Now how about something from “South Pacific?” "
"Frasier: I'm sorry. Just getting fed up with this nonsense. I'm forgetting names all the time. You know, last week, twice I forgot where I parked my car. "
"Martin: Join the club, pal. You're getting older. "
"Frasier: Oh, well of course I'm getting older. We're all getting older. But I'm not that old. "
"Niles: Oh, I'm afraid dad may have a point. I know you'd like to believe we're still the same devilish sprigs we always were. Sitting on mother's davenport in our tweeds and tans, listening to the Texaco symphonic hour. The cold-hearted reality is, you're middle-aged. "
"Frasier: Niles, I'm forty-one. That's hardly middle-aged. Middle age is more like fifty, fifty-five. "
"Niles: Only if you live to be one hundred and ten. "
"Daphne: I'm all ready to go, Dr. Crane. "
"Frasier: Niles, where are you two off to? "
"Niles: I'm giving Daphne a lift. "
"Daphne: I'm meeting some of my girlfriends for darts and a couple of pints. Oh, it's best to do it in that order. Just ask Blind Willie, the bartender. "
"Frasier: Listen Daphne, before you go, I'd like to ask you a little question here. When you look at me, um, do you see me as a young man, or as an older man? "
"Daphne: Oh, no. No, you don't. You're not getting me into that Vietnam. I learned a long time ago there are three questions you never answer honestly. “How old do I look?” “Do you like my hair?” and “Was it good for you too?” Coming, Dr. Crane? ...Dr. Crane? "
"Niles: I'm sorry, I was someplace else. It was a warm and friendly place. "
"Frasier: Big surprise, I got a headache. Let me get an aspirin. The very suggestion that I'm descending into old age just because I can't remember a couple of names, or a tune on the piano. "
"Martin: Your arm's not quite long enough for that, is it? Let me ask you a few questions. Can you get through the night without getting up to go to the john? Can you get in and out of a chair without going “Mmmm?” Can you eat a slice of pizza less than twelve hours before you go to bed? "
"Frasier: What's on the pizza? "
"Martin: A-ha. I thought so. Alright, well now we've established you're middle-aged. Take some "
"advice: don't fight it, it'll go a lot easier. "
"Frasier: Good lord, dad, what are you suggesting? I'm gonna rush off to a plastic surgeon to get an eye lift and a chin tuck? Oh, dear god "
"Martin: I'm just telling you, when guys get to this stage they do some squirrelly things that they never would have done when they were younger. "
"Frasier: Dad, please spare me, I am a psychiatrist, I know the routine. Good lord, who is that? "
"Martin: That's me. In '74. Going through my own little stage. I'd dyed my hair jet black and bought a leather jacket and a Harley Davidson. "
"Frasier: My God, dad. You look like one of the Village People. "
"Martin: Well, fortunately I came to my senses before you got back from Harvard that summer. "
"Frasier: Are those love beads? "
"Martin: All right, that's enough. Just do me a favour, will ya? Keep your guard up, and don't do something stupid, all right? "
"Frasier: Okay, dad. "
"Martin: You may think it's tough being middle-aged, but think about me. I got a son who's middle-aged. "
"Frasier: Ahhhh... "
"Martin: I heard that "
"One: Department store, gents casual. "
"Martin: Say, didn't this used to be Pinski's department store? "
"Frasier: I have no idea. "
"Martin: Sure it was. we used to bring you kids here all the time. Man, it was a great store. You could buy lingerie, a bag of popcorn and transmission fluid, all under the same roof. "
"Frasier: Finally, something I'm glad I forgot. "
"Daphne: Well, Mr. Crane, I believe I came here on a mission. "
"Martin: Alright, but remember, I don't want anything fancy or that comes in tubes. I want them white, I want them plain, and I want them boxers. "
"Daphne: That's the exactly the kind of lack of imagination that sunk the British Empire. "
"Martin: Hey, Frasier. Check out these dress pants. They got elastic panels in the waist. You could eat all you want, and never worry about cutting off your circulation. "
"Frasier: Milan must be beside itself. What an innovative use of synthetic fibres. I believe if you recycle these, you can turn them into milk containers. "
"Martin: Are you gonna get them or not? "
"Frasier: You brought these over for me? "
"Martin: Hey, the sands of time are shifting, buddy - mostly south Listen, if you don't want to go with elastic, maybe you could go with suspenders. That way, if you keep your jacket closed, that little gut of yours can hang down to here and nobody’s any the wiser. "
"Frasier: I do not have a gut I have... contours. "
"Carrie: Excuse me. I was wondering if anyone was helping you? "
"Martin: Oh, no. She's looking at something with stripes Daphne Daphne, get away from there "
"Carrie: You're not thinking of getting those, are you? "
"Frasier: Oh, no. "
"Carrie: I have something much better over here. What do you think of these? They don't do much on the hanger but, they could really work on a nice, tall guy like you. "
"Frasier: Oh, you really think so? "
"Carrie: Yeah. You've got a great build. "
"Frasier: Oh, well. Thank you very much, ah...? "
"Carrie: Carrie. "
"Frasier: Ah, Carrie. "
"Carrie: Let's see what we can get working here. Um, This is kind of a young look, but you could really pull it off. "
"Frasier: ...I don't really think it's me. "
"Carrie: Are you sure? I think this would look really good on you. "
"Frasier: Well, I suppose I could try it on. But you know, just out of curiosity, how old do you think I am? "
"Carrie: Oh, I don't want to do that. "
"Frasier: No, no, no, please go ahead. "
"Carrie: I don't know. Um... thirty-six? "
"Frasier: Are you serious? "
"Carrie: Oh, God. I'm sorry. You're probably more like thirty-four. Now you don't want to buy anything from me. "
"Frasier: Are those Armani shirts expensive? "
"Carrie: Yeah. "
"Frasier: I'll take two "
"Carrie: Great Changing room's right this way. You know, I love to guess what my customers do by what they wear. Let me guess. You're an architect, right? "
"Frasier: No, I'm a psychiatrist. "
"Carrie: Oh. I've taken some psychiatry courses. What are you, Freudian? Reichian? "
"Frasier: Well actually, lately I've been leaning more towards Jung. Guess that's because I'm “Jung at heart.” "
"Frasier: Gotta be the oldest joke in the psychiatrist's joke book. Can't believe I said it. "
"Carrie: I can't believe I laughed at that. "
"Frasier: I bet you laugh at all of your customer’s jokes. "
"Carrie: No. Just the cute ones. "
"Frasier: ...Cute jokes or customers? "
"Carrie: You figure it out. "
"Martin: Hey, you about ready? "
"Frasier: Oh, just a second, dad, I'm trying on a pair of pants. Hey, did you notice that girl who came over and asked to help us earlier? "
"Martin: Sure I noticed her. I'm not dead. "
"Frasier: Well you know, we just had a little conversation a minute ago and uh, I could swear she was flirting with me. "
"Martin: Trust me son, she's on commission. "
"Frasier: Oh no, I know a sales pitch when I hear one, and that was no sales pitch. She's definitely interested in me. Think I may have to see where this may lead. "
"Martin: I know you're forgetting things lately, but don't you remember the little talk we had last night? "
"Frasier: Oh, dear. It sneaks right up on you, doesn't it? What am I thinking about? A forty-one year-old man going out with a girl that's twenty-two, twenty-three? "
"Martin: Yeah. Young enough to be your daughter. "
"Frasier: Yes, thank you for pointing that out, dad. "
"TO: "
"Two: KACL radio station. "
"Frasier: This is Dr Frasier Crane, KACL 780 talk radio, thanking you for joining us today. Up next, Bob “Bulldog” Briscoe and the “Gonzo Sports Show.” Until tomorrow, here's wishing you good mental health. "
"Bulldog: Hey, doc. Hear the great news? Ken Griffey Junior's groin pull is completely healed. "
"Frasier: Thank goodness. I'm sure years from now we'll all remember where we were the moment we heard the joyful news. "
"Carrie: Excuse me, Dr. Crane? "
"Frasier: Hi, Carrie. "
"Carrie: Hi. I have your pants. "
"Bulldog: Whoa, doc Where'd you leave them? "
"Frasier: They're new, Bulldog. Some of the finer department stores deliver garments to their busier customers. "
"Carrie: Actually, we don't. I just thought it would be nice to see you again. "
"Bulldog: Excuse me. You look very familiar. Didn't I let you pour a flaming tequila shooter down my throat at Sloppy Nick’s during ah, last year’s Indy 500? "
"Carrie: Ah, no. "
"Bulldog: Well, what are you doing next Memorial Day? "
"Frasier: Bulldog, as certain as I am that any young lady in the world would love to set your face on fire, Carrie, I believe, is here to see me. "
"Bulldog: Okay. Hey, you can't blame a dog for trying. [going into Roz's booth] Just on the off chance it might make a difference, I ah, drive a '94 Camaro. "
"Carrie: Is he gay? Well, I've been studying about this in school, and it seems like he's really overcompensating. "
"Frasier: Yes, well, I'm not sure. But I certainly look forward to running that theory by him. Well um, thank you for the pants, Carrie, and uh, do I owe you anything? "
"Carrie: Oh, no. I really enjoyed meeting you yesterday, and it seemed like we had a few laughs together and, maybe we could, you know, go out and have a cup of coffee sometime? "
"Frasier: I'm very flattered that you'd like to go out with me, and uh, jeez, I think you're a beautiful young woman.. "
"Carrie: But? "
"Frasier: Well it's, it's our ages. I mean, how old are you? "
"Carrie: Twenty-two. How old are you? "
"Frasier: That's not polite. I just don't think it would be appropriate for us to date. "
"Carrie: How about we just live together? I'm just trying to lighten an uncomfortable moment. "
"Frasier: Right. Ha-ha. Well done. "
"Carrie: Well, I'm sorry. But if you change your mind you know where I am. Enjoy your pants. "
"Frasier: Same to you. "
"Bulldog: I only got a second here, but... [raps on Frasier's forehead, hard] HELLO? ANYONE THERE? She wanted to go out with you. You didn't have to chase her. You didn't have to harass her. You didn't have to pay her It was like, a miracle. "
"Frasier: She's too young. "
"Bulldog: Are you following any of this? "
"Frasier: I don't expect you to understand. "
"Bulldog: Great. 'Cause I don't. So you're not going out with her? "
"Frasier: No, I'm not. "
"Bulldog: Good. I'm going to see if I can catch up with her at the elevator. Maybe she's never dated a former professional hockey player before. "
"Frasier: You never played hockey. "
"Bulldog: "
"Roz: Talk about pathetic. "
"Frasier: Yes, isn't he though? "
"Roz: I meant you. "
"Frasier: Me? What, are you saying I should go out with her? "
"Roz: Frasier, take it from me. It's hard enough to find somebody. So when an opportunity like this comes along, you gotta grab it. "
"Frasier: Roz, what about the age thing? "
"Roz: Well, what about it? "
"Frasier: Oh, come on You see an old man walking down the street arm in arm with a beautiful young girl, what do you think? "
"Roz: I think he must be really rich. Then I try to make eye contact. "
"TO: "
"Three: Cafe Nervosa. "
"Niles: There you are, Frasier. I'm so glad you called me. "
"Frasier: Well, thanks for coming, Niles. "
"Niles: Some of Maris's friends introduced me to the most delightful party game last night. I can't wait to share it with you. "
"Frasier: Well Niles, I'd really like to talk... "
"Niles: No, no. Shh. This first, it's a hoot. If you were stranded on a desert island with one meal, one aria, and one bottle of wine, what would they be? "
"Frasier: Niles, I really don't... "
"Niles: Frasier, please. "
"Frasier: Okay... A Big Mac, “I'm your Venus,” and Ripple. "
"Niles: ...If you're going to mock the game, then don't play. "
"Frasier: Gladly. "
"Niles: Are you still crabbed up about this middle-aged business? "
"Frasier: No. No-no-no, I'm fine there. By the way, you were absolutely right, Niles. "
"Niles: Ooh I love to hear you say that. "
"Frasier: Yes. But I do have a problem. You see, the other day I was asked out by a... this twenty-two year old girl that I met in a mall. "
"Niles: That is alarming. "
"Frasier: Well, I turned her down. "
"Niles: No no, you were in a mall. Did anyone see you? "
"Frasier: Niles No, I'm just wondering if I made the right decision. You see, I would, I would love to go out with this girl. She's fantastic. I’m just afraid of looking like some old fool chasing after a young girl. Becoming a walking mid-life crisis cliché. Running around like that buffoon Stanley Barrister. "
"Niles: Oh, Stanley Barrister. That is embarrassing, isn't it? "
"Frasier: Oh, is that not beyond the pale? I mean, that girl - how old can she be? "
"Niles: Twenty-one, if she's a day. "
"Frasier: I saw them, it was last Tuesday night, together. "
"Niles: Well, and I saw them together Wednesday morning. "
"Both: Eww "
"Niles: That's disgusting. "
"Frasier: That's what's so frightening. Well, this is what I'm afraid of. People will have the same conversation about me. "
"Niles: Stanley Barrister is a sixty-year-old man who wears a toupee that looks like something he pulled out of a shower drain. You are forty-one, and obviously not wearing a toupee. "
"Frasier: Thank you, Niles. So you think it would be okay to go out with this woman? "
"Niles: Doesn't matter what I think. "
"Frasier: Well, it does to me. You're my brother, I value your opinion. "
"Niles: My opinion isn't relevant. "
"Frasier: Don't be coy, Niles. And will you please stop pursing your lips? It makes you look like one of those old women they carve out of dried apples. "
"Niles: Don't you see? What I think about you dating a younger woman is immaterial. What we think about Stanley Barrister is immaterial. The only thing that matters is what you think. Ask yourself, if you went out with her, would you be doing it because you were running away from your age, or because you think this has the potential of becoming a meaningful relationship? "
"Frasier: I don't know. "
"Niles: Find out. And then to hell with what people think. "
"Frasier: Niles, you are absolutely right. "
"Niles: Oh There it is again, I never tire of hearing that. Let the tongues of the doubting nabobs wag. If it feels right, make yourself happy. "
"Frasier: Thank you, thank you. Oh, by the way Niles, if you were stranded on a desert island, what would you choose as your favorite meal, aria and wine? "
"Niles: The Coulibiliac of salmon at Guy Savoy, “Vissi d’Arte” from Tosca, and the Neuf du Pape '47. "
"Frasier: You are SO predictable. "
"TO: "
"Four: The Department Store. "
"Frasier: Carrie, hi. "
"Carrie: Hi. I didn't expect to see you here. "
"Frasier: Well um, I could lie to you and tell you I came here to shop, but actually I came here to see you. "
"Carrie: That's great. I've been thinking about you a lot. "
"Frasier: Well, I've been thinking a lot about you too, and I just wanted to chat a little bit about why I thought we shouldn't go out. "
"Carrie: Okay. "
"Frasier: Well, you see, I thought I was going through a phase. You know, well, a mid-life crisis to be frank. And ah, I was afraid if I went out with you I would be trying to recapture my youth or something. "
"Carrie: Oh my God. I can't believe you're saying this. I was afraid that I asked you out only because I was trying to work out some stuff of my own. You know, some unresolved issues about my father or something. "
"Frasier: Oh no, no. Because I went back and forth, you know? I felt like a fool, and then I didn't... "
"Carrie: Me, too. Back and forth. "
"Frasier: And then I thought maybe you just came along because, to fill some sort of a need or something. "
"Carrie: Or, or maybe this could be something serious. "
"Frasier: Exactly. So... well. All right, I asked myself a few tough questions.. "
"Carrie: Me too. "
"Frasier: And well, I finally came to a decision. "
"Carrie: Me too. I think us going out would have been really stupid. "
"Frasier: Me too "
"Carrie: It would have completely clouded things with my father, and you and I would never have been on a very firm footing. But you knew all that. You could have told me, but you just let me figure it out for myself. "
"Frasier: Yes, I'm sort of like the Wizard of Oz. "
"Carrie: It's no wonder everybody listens to your radio show. You're so smart. "
"Frasier: ...Actually, I am full of crap. I had no idea that you might have been grappling with some personal issues here. Some psychiatrist, huh? The truth is, I came down here to talk you into going out with me. I guess it's still a pretty bad idea. "
"Carrie: You're being so honest with me... that is such an attractive quality in a man. "
"Frasier: ...Well, you know, let's not go down that road again. "
"Carrie: Okay. "
"Frasier: See you around. "

"Frasier: Oh look, Roz, Roz, my brochures are here Oh, god, very exciting Vacation "
"Roz: Wow The Golden Door Spa "
"Frasier: Ooh, yes "
"Roz: Look at those accommodations That is nice "
"Frasier: I plan to leave Dad and Eddie to fend for themselves while I go off and spend an obscene amount of money being pampered like a spoiled child. I know it's self-indulgent, but what else are vacations for? By the way, what are you doing for your week off? "
"Roz: Oh, I'm taking my mom to Ireland to stay in the sod house where her mother was born. "
"Frasier: Why don't you just write the words 'bad son' on my forehead "
"Roz: Listen, there is nothing wrong with pampering yourself on your vacation. After all, you do work three hours a day. "
"Roz: I'm sorry. That one even surprised me "
"Frasier: You know, it's just that when I think of the relationship I have with my dad I can't help but envy the relationship you have with your mother. "
"Roz: Well, it didn't just happen. We work at it, spend time together... "
"Frasier: Roz, are you forgetting that my father lives with me? How much more time together could we spend "
"Roz: Day to day living is different. You know, there is nothing better than taking a trip together. You get to have a little fun, you get to relax... you get to see a whole different side to the other person. "
"Frasier: You know, in his entire life, my dad has never been to Europe. It would be a way of connecting with him if I were the one to give him that. So, what would you charge me to take him to Ireland with you? "
"Niles: Ahh... I should have known this would happen. I always throw out my back when I try to lift Maris's luggage. "
"Daphne: Why didn't you hire a skycap? "
"Niles: Oh, we did for most of it, but Maris won't trust strangers with her makeup case, ever since a ham-handed porter dropped it and broke three vials of rare Swiss lamb placenta. On the upside, the calfskin lining of her case was never more soft and supple. "
"Daphne: Where did Mrs. Crane go, anyway? "
"Niles: She's making her annual pilgrimage to the holy land. "
"Martin: I thought she was going to Dallas to visit her sister. "
"Niles: That is her holy land. It's the site of the first Nieman- Marcus. "
"Daphne: Oh, Dr. Crane... "
"Niles: Oh, call me Niles "
"Niles: Thank you, Daphne. "
"Frasier: Dad, I've had an idea and I hope you're as excited about it as I am. [opens his briefcase and takes out the holiday brochures] I want to take you on vacation "
"Martin: Why? "
"Frasier: Well, I thought an adventure might do us good, give us a chance to have some fun, maybe get reacquainted, even do a little bonding. "
"Martin: What'd you have in mind? "
"Frasier: Well, this isn't about where I want to go, this is about where you want to go. "
"Frasier: Dad, I give you the world "
"Martin: The Galy-pay-gos islands, huh? “Where iguanas, sea-lions and giant tortoises live in eternal harmony.' Is it important they get along? "
"Frasier: No, I suppose not. "
"Niles: Oh, how about this India and Nepal Trek the foothills of the Himalayas "
"Martin: I think you're forgetting about my old pal here. "
"Niles: No problem. Frasier can just hire a really tough little Sherpa to carry you on his back. "
"Niles: They don't mind. "
"Frasier: Well, we obviously haven't struck the right chord yet, but we will, we will. Dad, why don't you just suggest something? "
"Martin: You really want to go on a trip with me? "
"Frasier: Yes I do I'll go anywhere you want to Anywhere "
"Martin: Okay. Well, maybe I'm not as sophisticated as you, but I think I should see America first "
"Frasier: Great We're Americans, we should see America "
"Martin: And I want to see it in a Winnebago "
"Frasier: A Winnebago Hot damn, that has a real ring to it "
"Martin: Yeah It's something your mother and I always dreamed about doing when I retired. "
"Frasier: Then that is exactly the trip we are going to take "
"Martin: You really mean it? "
"Frasier: Absolutely "
"Daphne: This calls for a celebration "
"Martin: Yeah, let's pop open a couple of beers I think I've got a bag of pork rinds in here too "
"Frasier: Oh, the final touch I almost feel like I'm in a trailer park already "
"Niles: Oh, Winnebago Boy? Make sure to hang a lot of beach chairs on the back and give it a really cute name like... 'The Whoopin' Cranes' "
"Frasier: Oh, Niles. When I agreed to see America with Dad I thought we'd be staying in five-star resorts When I said together I meant adjoining suites "
"Niles: Just tell him you think it's a bad idea. "
"Frasier: I can't do that, he's counting on this trip too much. It was his dream, he was going to go on this trip with Mom. "
"Niles: Yeah, but she lucked out and died "
"Frasier: Niles listen, listen. If Dad and I get into a Winnebago together only one of us will come out alive. You’ve got to come with us "
"Niles: Frasier, you're my brother. That entitles you to my bone marrow and one of my kidneys, but THIS is an imposition "
"Martin: You've got to come with us "
"Daphne: Why? "
"Martin: Well, Frasier and I don't have anything to talk about I always feel more comfortable when there's someone else around, or the TV's blaring. "
"Daphne: Then why did you suggest it? "
"Martin: Well, it sounded like a good idea when it came out of my mouth, but the more I think about it... I mean, can you really see me and Frasier together all day and then crawling into our bunks at Night, lying head to head... bonding? Eew I'll pay you I've got pension money "
"Frasier: I remember a car trip we took when I was nine? We drove from Seattle to Spokane. The only thing he said to me was, 'I think we've got a problem with your brother Frasier.' "
"Niles: Those were awful, those family driving vacations. Dad insisting on covering as many miles as possible in a day. The two of us tiny hostages in the back seat, clutching our car sickness bags... straining to see something out of the window as the landscape whizzed by... I was thirteen before I realized cows aren't blurry "
"Daphne: Why don't you just tell him you don't want to go? "
"Martin: Oh, you heard how he wants to go. I don't want to disappoint him "
"Frasier: I don't want to disappoint him "
"Niles: I'm sorry Frasier, I am not a Winnebago person. "
"Niles: Whenever I see one on the highway I look into the driver's eyes, hoping to see something that would explain why in God's name he would ever want to do something like this All I see is a death stare under the brim of a hat made out of Miller Lite cans. This is my final "
"word: I'm-not-going. "
"Martin: Hey, great news, Daphne's coming too "
"Niles: And so am I "
"TO: "
"Martin: It's everything I'd hoped it'd be, only better It's like sitting in your own living room watching TV Only it isn't TV, it's America "
"Frasier: Yes Dad, it's the ultimate in virtual reality programming - actual reality. "
"Martin: Okay, we've got a turn-off coming up in about five miles, so start slowing down. "
"Frasier: Righto, Dad. "
"Daphne: How does it feel behind that wheel, Dr. Crane? "
"Frasier: Manly This is mine, and it's big "
"Niles: Oh my God It's like being sealed upright in a Formica coffin "
"Martin: Remember the old days, Niles? When they were kids, all they had in the back seat was a mayonnaise jar. "
"Frasier: Yes, it took quite a bit of skill to use it successfully at seventy miles per hour Never really been fond of mayonnaise since... "
"Niles: Or speed bumps. "
"Martin: Okay, turnoff's coming up now, we're about four miles away, get ready, it's coming up Alright, you're okay on the right It's never to early to move over "
"Frasier: You know, Dad, I was wondering. What inspired you to choose that uniquely American man-made wonder, Mount Rushmore? "
"Martin: Well, we've got a week off, right? That's as far as we can go in three and a half days and still make it back. We get there, get out, walk around the Valley of the Presidents, drive back, boom Another fine landmark under our belts "
"Daphne: Well, you've certainly got this trip well-planned, Mr. Crane Whenever I take a holiday I just grab a fresh pair of knickers and see where the wind takes me "
"Frasier: Niles... Niles ' Frasier, however, drives on happily with "
"Frasier: You know, what Daphne is saying is what we should really be doing "
"Martin: What are you talking about? "
"Frasier: Well, you know, why should we be so beholden to maps and schedules? We should roam America has always been enchanted with the romance of the open highway. Jack Kerouac went “on the road,” Buzz and Todd got their “kicks on Route 66” The adventure is in the journey We should just ramble "
"Niles: Good golly, I'm inspired. I'm going to put on a baseball cap. "
"Martin: Frasier watch it, you're going to miss the turn off "
"Frasier: So? "
"Martin: We'll get lost "
"Frasier: Lost from where? We're in a house on wheels Wherever we go, we're home "
"Martin: No It's coming up It's coming up Alright, turn here This is it Turn Turn here... We missed it "
"Frasier: Dad, we didn't miss anything "
"Martin: Oh my God "
"Frasier: We are now on the road less traveled. From now on there is a new order We dance to the rhythm of the road. "
"Martin: Alright, now don't panic There's got to be an access road leading back onto that turn off... "
"Martin: Where is it? Where is it Oh, it's always in the crack "
"Frasier: So is life, Dad. "
"Time: 10"
":23) "
"Martin: I've got to say, I was pretty anxious, but I'm starting to like this free spirit stuff "
"Frasier: Oh Dad, Dad look There's a historical marker up ahead Let’s stop Let's go see it, huh? "
"Martin: Yes, just driving wherever you feel like it... "
"Niles: It's educational Dad, there There There There There Dad "
"Niles: What did it say? "
"Frasier: I don't know. The only word I saw was 'Legendary.' "
"Niles: Oh, oh look, a roadside stand Fresh fruit, homemade apple cider Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad... "
"Both: Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, DAD "
"Frasier: Look Dad, you seem to be missing the freewheeling concept. "
"Frasier: We're supposed to go where the wind blows us, for god's sakes "
"Martin: It's blowing, we're going, why are you moaning? "
"Frasier: What is this obsession you have with covering a certain distance? "
"Martin: It's just the way I relax "
"Martin: Hey, watch it I've got my kids in the car "
"Frasier: What you call relaxing seems like a man with an obsession to me Don't you think so, Niles? "
"Frasier: Niles What are you doing? "
"Niles: I'm making a vacation video, something that we can look at years from now, over and over and over and over again... "
"Frasier: Just give me that "
"Martin: Okay, you guys want to stop so bad, we'll stop. See that sign over there? "
"Niles: “Have your photo taken with a live grizzly bear - Marvella's souvenirs and gifts - one mile.” "
"Martin: Yeah I always wanted to have my picture taken with a bear "
"Frasier: Well, some dreams cannot be denied [looking into the passenger side view mirror] Okay dad, alright, you're good here, you're good on my side, dad. Alright, just go ahead, ease it right over, it's never to early to change lanes... Oh my God, it must be genetic. "
"TO: "
"Marvella: Get your dog away from my bear I just had him cleaned "
"Daphne: He's stuffed "
"Frasier: You know, your sign said 'a live bear.' "
"Marvella: It's an old sign. "
"Martin: Would you look at that view It's like we're really there "
"Frasier: Yes, but if we were actually there dad, we'd be whizzing past at fifty miles per hour "
"Niles: Oh Frasier, look It's the gourmet food department "
"Frasier: Oh Homemade deer jerky "
"Niles: No sampling... "
"Frasier: No problem "
"Martin: Okay Excuse me Would you take our picture, please? Niles, Frasier, come on up here Okay, everybody, alright, here we go Everybody ready? Now, what should we do? "
"Frasier: Well, how about this? [he puts his hands up and opens his mouth wide as if he's scared of the bear] "
"Martin: Yeah That's great, I like that Okay, everybody Eddie? "
"Marvella: Now, before I take it, you know it's ten dollars Canadian. "
"Frasier: Oh, for a treasured memory like this, what's money? "
"Marvella: Okay, one... "
"Daphne: Why would she want Canadian dollars? "
"Marvella: Two... "
"Martin: Because we're in Canada. "
"Marvella: Three "
"Daphne: We're in Canada? "
"Martin: Yeah, we crossed the border a while ago, when you were taking a nap. "
"Daphne: But we can't be in Canada I'm not allowed to leave the United States "
"Frasier: Why? "
"Daphne: Because I don't have my green card yet Oh, this is just perfect Three months until my final interview, the one thing they told me not to do was to leave the country And what do you do? Wait until the first time I fall asleep and drag me across the bleeding border They're never going to let me back in "
"Niles: They have to take you back, it's not your fault. [He crosses to comfort her] "
"Frasier: This wouldn't have happened if you weren't so hell-bent on getting so many miles under your belt today "
"Martin: Well, you're the one who had to go where the wind blows "
"Daphne: Never mind whose fault it is, I'm stuck here What am I going to do? "
"Niles: We'll just go to the authorities and explain. I'm sure mishaps like this happen all the time. "
"Martin: Oh, get real Niles, they've got the rules "
"Frasier: Oh, then what's your solution dad? "
"Martin: Just sneak her back across the border. "
"Niles: That's called smuggling "
"Martin: Oh, thanks Niles. I knew it was something bad guys did, I just didn't know the technical term "
"Frasier: Dad, I can't believe that you of all people, a former policeman, are actually suggesting that we commit a felony "
"Martin: Oh, I cross this border plenty Ninety-nine times out of a hundred the guards just peek in the door and wave you through. It's no big deal. Now let’s get out of here "
"Niles: Well, what if they pull us over? "
"Martin: Then Daphne's just got to convince them that she's an American. "
"Daphne: Bloody right It beats having me bum bounced back across the pond Let’s give it a bash. "
"Frasier: Oh, yes. This is foolproof... "
"TO: "
"Niles: I'm about to defraud the United States Immigration Department. Not just me, my father and my older brother. People who should be role models for me. It's not my fault; I'm the product of a bad environment. "
"Martin: Now listen, on the off chance that the guard asks you a question, can you say anything in an American accent? "
"Daphne: Sure. "
"Martin: Okay, what? "
"Daphne: You just heard it "
"Martin: What? "
"Daphne: “Sure.” That's it, that's all I can say Oh, I need a cup of tea "
"Frasier: TEA Why don't you just wave a crumpet in the air and start singing, 'God save the Queen' "
"Niles: Don't you snap at her, Frasier, you're a psychiatrist. You should be in better control of your emotions. Oh my God, there's the border I can see the line of cars "
"Martin: Alright, now everybody calm down, we're going to be fine. Just remember that they'll be looking for suspicious behavior. [Niles is rocking back and forth with his head resting on his arm.] Niles, that qualifies Alright, now if the guard pokes his head in here, what did we say he's going to see? "
"All: Four carefree Americans. "
"Daphne: I've never been so nervous. "
"Frasier: I don't think there's any need to be. They're waving everyone through... they're not even asking any questions "
"Niles: Oh, please, please, please "
"Frasier: They're waving us through... they're waving us through... they're pulling us over... they're pulling us over "
"TO: "
"Martin: Here comes the guard. "
"Daphne: I can't do this. "
"Martin: Now everything's going to be fine, don't worry. Just remember to keep your answers short. People who have something to hide always talk too much. "
"Guard: Hi, folks. "
"Martin: Hi, there "
"Guard: Have a good time in Canada? "
"Martin: Oh, great "
"Frasier: Canada, wow "
"Guard: What was the purpose of your trip to Canada, sir? "
"deadpan: "
"Niles: Fun. "
"Guard: And where were you born, Sir? "
"Frasier: Seattle, Washington. Oh, you want to know what country? Oh, well, America Of course I'm quite an American really, I vote all the time, and always for the law and order guy I... "
"Guard: That's fine, sir, I don't need any more details. And you, Miss? Did you enjoy Canada? "
"Daphne: Sure "
"Guard: And the weather? "
"Daphne: Sure, sure "
"Guard: Is this your vehicle Sir? "
"Frasier: Oh, no. Yes, yes Well, I rented it It's American-made, you see, I always look for that union label... "
"Guard: I just need your license and registration. "
"Frasier: Oh, right, uh, it's right here in this little side pocket. There's the registration. Let me get my license out for you... oh, yes, here we are "
"Guard: Stay right here. "
"Martin: Well, I can certainly depend on my gang, can't I? "
"Niles: That's it. I'm going to be arrested "
"Daphne: We're all getting arrested "
"Niles: Yes, but I have delicate features. Prison will be hell for me "
"Martin: Cool it, Niles. "
"Daphne: It's too late to turn back I say we make a run for it. "
"Frasier: Oh yes, great idea A high-speed chase in an eight-ton motor home It'll make an amusing anecdote for the border guard newsletter "
"Martin: Now will everybody just shut up? You keep babbling like this they're going to catch us for sure He's coming back "
"Guard: Well, these check out. "
"All: Well, glad to hear that... "
"Frasier: All strictly on the up and up... "
"Guard: Miss, you've been very quiet. Is there something I should know here? "
"Guard: You seem awfully nervous. May I have your name, please? "
"Martin: Oh, alright. I guess I should have known better than to try something like this "
"Niles: Dad, don't "
"Frasier: It was just a mistake "
"Guard: You men just want to back off? [to Martin] What is it you want to say, sir? "
"Martin: We were trying to pull one over on you. Eddie? "
"Martin: We don't have a rabies certificate for the dog. "
"Guard: I knew something was going on here. "
"Martin: Yeah, well you see, we weren't planning on coming here, and when we got to the border we just forgot all about it. "
"Niles: I for one, didn't even know that you needed one. "
"Frasier: Yes, but ignorance of the law is no defense so take the little dog away and we'll be off "
"Martin: Look, this is my fault. If you're worried that we picked the dog up here in Canada, well we didn't. I mean I've got a picture I can show you. Here's a picture of him taken at the Seattle Space Needle. "
"Guard: I see you've got a badge there. "
"Martin: Oh, yeah "
"Guard: Are you a policeman? "
"Martin: Retired. Thirty years on the Seattle police force. Me of all people should know better, huh? "
"Frasier: Absolutely. "
"Niles: Definitely. "
"Daphne: Sure. "
"Guard: Next time remember the rabies certificate. Have a safe trip home. "
"Martin: Thanks, officer. "
"Frasier: Thank you. "
"Martin: Drive "
"TO: "
"Frasier: They would have returned you eventually So dad, how long 'til we get home? "
"Martin: About two hours. This highway goes right into Seattle. Why don't you lean back, take a little nap? "
"Frasier: Oh no, I'm okay. I though maybe we'd chat a little bit. "
"Martin: Oh yeah, great "
"Martin: You know Frasier, I just can't help it. When we're alone together I just don't know what the hell to say. I'm sure you figured out that's why I asked Daphne to come along. "
"Frasier: Well, I had my suspicions but I hoped that wasn't the case. "
"Martin: Oh, knock it off. That's why you asked Niles to come along too. "
"Frasier: That's why I asked him, but that's not why he came. "
"Martin: You know, the funny thing, we didn't have such a bad time, did we? "
"Frasier: “I see you've got a badge there...” “Oh, yeah” "
"Frasier: You know dad, there's no reason for us to cut our trip short. According to this map we're not that far from Yellowstone. "
"Martin: Oh, I always wanted to see Old Faithful "
"Frasier: Me, too "
"Martin: If you wanted a real adventure we could drop these two sleeping beauties off at home first. "
"Frasier: You mean it? Just the two of us alone? "
"Martin: Yeah "
"Frasier: Just you and me, father and son "
"Martin: Yeah You and me, camping out in Yellowstone, all alone "
"Frasier: All by ourselves "
"Martin: Well, you know, it'd be an awful shame if Daphne didn't get to see those Indian paint pots... "
"Frasier: Yes, of course. "
"Martin: They are a real miracle of nature. "
"Frasier: Yeah. Wouldn't be fair to leave Niles just to ramble around that old house all by himself. "
"Martin: Maris out of town? That'd be cruel. "
"Frasier: Yeah, absolutely. So, how long do you figure it'll take us to get to Yellowstone? "
"Martin: Well, if we drive all night we'll be there tomorrow. "
"Frasier: It'll be a nice surprise for the two of them when they wake up in the morning. "
"Martin: I've got a better surprise than "
"that: let's tell Daphne we're in Mexico "

"Waitress: Here you go Doc, your usual. "
"Frasier: My usual. How lovely it is to have a usual. What is this? "
"Waitress: Latte with nutmeg and cinnamon. "
"Frasier: Ah, no, no, no, that's my brother's usual. Mine is the double Kona with cream. "
"Niles: Oh, Frasier, am I glad to see you. "
"Waitress: Your usual, Doc? "
"Niles: Please. Thank you "
"Frasier: Niles, you seem more than usually agitated today. Problem? "
"Niles: I'm meeting my publisher here in five minutes. Remember the book deal I signed last month, the one you were so jealous of? "
"Frasier: I wasn't jealous of it, Niles, you just wanted me to be jealous. "
"Niles: It's all moot anyway, the deal's about to be killed. It turns out the idea I sold them had already been done. They gave me until today to think up an alternative and I've got bupkes. I've got less than bupkes. I've got what bupkes keeps for lint in the bottom of his pocket "
"Frasier: Can't you just ask for an extension? "
"Niles: No, no, I've asked for two already. "
"Niles: Oh God there he is. Sam, so good to see you. "
"Sam: Niles. "
"Niles: Sam Tanaka, my brother Dr. Frasier Crane. "
"Frasier: My pleasure. "
"Sam: Nice to meet you. "
"Niles: Sam, would you like a coffee? "
"Sam: Oh, I'll have what he's having. "
"Niles: So you shall. "
"Frasier: One more, please. "
"Sam: Wait a second, you're the doctor from the radio, aren't you? "
"Frasier: Guilty as charged. "
"Sam: I listen to your show all the time. "
"Frasier: Well, thank you. "
"Sam: I never put it together that you two of you were brothers. "
"Niles: All our lives. "
"Sam: Well, you two must have incredible insight into sibling relationships. "
"Frasier: No more than your average psychiatrist brothers. "
"Sam: So Niles, what's your idea? "
"Niles: My idea... Well Sam, you know I've given it a lot of thought, and it's not easy... "
"Sam: You'd almost think there's a book in that. "
"Niles: In what? "
"Sam: Two psychiatrist brothers writing about sibling relationships. "
"Niles: That, Sam, is why you are the most respected publisher in the greater Seattle area. That is exactly the idea we were going to pitch to you. "
"Frasier: What? I hate to interrupt... "
"Sam: Terrific Gentlemen, I'm going to cancel my lunch date so I can take you two out to celebrate. "
"Niles: Well, we were going to write today, but OK. "
"Frasier: Niles, what the hell are you doing? I don't want to write a book. For God’s sake, I'm out of here. "
"Niles: Frasier, I know it's asking a big favor. I mean, I know you're busy. But I want you to know that all of my life I've dreamed of one "
"thing: the day I could go into a library and go to the card catalogue and see my name under 'mental illness' - the day I could finally feel what you feel; that I'm somebody, not just one more dusty little psychiatrist in a grey pinstripe suit. "
"Frasier: Oh Niles, I... "
"Niles: Come on We haven't collaborated on anything together since we wrote the spring musical in prep school. "
"Frasier: Well, it was well received. And it did get us out of gym class. "
"Niles: It could be like that again. "
"Frasier: I don't know, Niles... "
"Niles: Ump-da, ump-da, ump-da, da-da-da, ump-da, ump-da, ump-da... "
"Both: Though some boys go to college, But we think they're all wussies, ‘Cause they get all the knowledge, And we get all the... Ump-da, ump-da, ump-da, da-da-da, ump-da, ump-da, ump-da... "
"Frasier: Alright, I'll do it "
"Niles: Yes "
"Frasier: Tu ma frere. "
"Niles: Tu ma frere. "
"Martin: Hello Niles, what are you doing over here? "
"Frasier: Oh Dad, I told you it's our first writing session tonight. "
"Martin: But I thought you were doing it over at Niles's house. "
"Niles: Er, we were supposed to. Unfortunately, it's Maris's turn to host her sherry tasting group and things tend to get a little raucous when she does. "
"Martin: But “The Silencer”'s on in twenty minutes. "
"Frasier: Dad, I've solved that problem. "
"Frasier: I've bought you these headphones, see? You'll be able to listen to the TV, without disturbing Niles and me as we work. "
"Martin: What about Eddie? How's he going to hear? "
"Frasier: He can read about the game in tomorrow's paper. Try 'em out, Dad. "
"Martin: "
"Niles: Very clever solution. "
"Frasier: Yes, and it also has another little feature that I like a lot. Watch this. "
"Frasier: Hey, Dad Nice shirt. Did they throw that in the last time you had your tires rotated? "
"Niles: Hey Dad? Tell us about the time you met Dwight Eisenhower. We haven't heard that story this hour "
"Frasier: Okay, okay, my turn. Hey, Dad? Remember- "
"Martin: Say another word and I'll club you both with my cane. "
"Martin: This is great, thanks a lot. [puts earphones around Eddie's neck] You better watch out for this for me, Eddie. I'm going to get myself a little snack. Who wants some beer? "
"Frasier: Just you Alright now, Niles, this is no time to procrastinate. "
"Niles: OK, here we go. Chapter One. Page One. Paragraph One. I'm indenting "
"Frasier: I hate to squash your enthusiasm, but don't you think before We start actually typing the book, we should discuss what the book is going to be about "
"Niles: Forgive me for just barreling ahead, but damn it, I'm jazzed. You know we have to approach this book from a completely different angle from all of our previous writings, our dissertations, out theses... "
"Frasier: Hmm, that's right. Yeah, this has to be interesting "
"Niles: Well, the obvious approach is case histories. We'll fill the book with anecdotes with brothers and sisters we've dealt with in our practice. "
"Frasier: Yes, and if we throw in a few references to heaving bosoms, we're bound to make Book of the Month Club. "
"Martin: Why, I could tell you a couple of stories about you guys you could throw in there. "
"Niles: That's an idea, we could use ourselves, it would make a delicious introduction to our book. "
"Frasier: I like the introduction idea. Dad, OK, give us a story which depicts little Frasier and little Niles at their conflicted best. "
"Martin: Oh, that has to be when we went trout fishing up at that lake whats-its-name. Boy, you guys were at it tooth and nail. "
"Niles: This is good, this is interesting. "
"Martin: Now, what was the name of that lake again. "
"Frasier: Dad, the name of the lake is immaterial. "
"Martin: Indian word, Lake Whatchahatchi? "
"Frasier: Dad, you're missing the point here. "
"Martin: Oh, your mother would know. Too bad she's dead Er, whatacouchi, whatawoochi. It was an Indian word, it meant 'Land of a thousand...' No This is driving me nuts I'm going to have to go in there and look it up. "
"Frasier: Dad, we just wanted the story "
"Martin: No, it's alright. Now where the hell did I put my atlas? "
"Frasier: Quite a resource, isn't he? "
"Niles: Alright, we'll just put the introduction on hold. "
"Frasier: Okay, back to case histories. Well, I suppose I could go take my files out of storage after the re... [thinks of something] Niles, is there a light bulb over my head? "
"Niles: You have an idea? "
"Frasier: No, I'm actually asking you if there's a light bulb over my head Of course I have an idea, it's my radio show. I mean, what better source of case histories can there be? I'll just ask my listeners to call in with their personal stories of sibling conflict, and you could be my guest on the show. "
"Niles: So, what you're suggesting, is that exploit your listeners’ lives for our own personal game? "
"Frasier: In essence, yes. What do you think? "
"Niles: I think it's borderline sleazy. Let's go for it "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Hello, Roz. "
"Roz: Hey, Frasier. What's your brother doing here? "
"Frasier: He's going to be my guest on the show today. "
"Roz: Oh, no I don't think so I am the producer, and I approve all the guests. This wasn't run by me and I do not approve him "
"Frasier: OK, Roz, bye-bye, have a good show. "
"Roz: Okay, okay. But I won't make him coffee, I won't run his Errands and I'm not taking any of his crapola. Hey, Niles, welcome aboard. Five seconds till air. "
"Frasier: OK, Niles, sit down, take a deep breath and try not to spit on the mike Hello Seattle, this is Dr. Frasier Crane. I have a very special guest with me today - my brother, the eminent psychiatrist, Dr. Niles Crane. "
"Niles: Hello, Emerald City What's doing, what's happenin'? "
"Frasier: What the hell do you think you're doing? "
"Niles: That was my radio persona. Every successful radio personality has one. "
"Frasier: I don't. "
"Niles: My point exactly. "
"Frasier: Just try to be yourself, will you? Our topic today is "
"siblings: what makes you love them, what makes you hate them... "
"Niles: What little things do they do that especially annoy you? These could be things from your childhood OR they could things from your adolesence, OR they could be things from your young adulthood OR... "
"Frasier: They could be things that are going on right now Roz, who's our first caller? "
"Roz: We have Donald from Bainbridge Island. He hasn't spoken to his brother for over twenty years. "
"Frasier: Hello, Donald. "
"Niles: I'm listening "
"Frasier: We're listening "
"Laura: I'll never forget it, Dr. Crane, I cried for two hours straight. "
"Frasier: So, you were completely bald. "
"Laura: Yes, the perm destroyed my hair. I was sure my sisters were going to laugh at me. But, they all kissed me and then they marched into the bathroom and shaved their heads too, just so I wouldn't feel like a freak. "
"Frasier: Amazing Well, there you have it, Seattle - the miracle of the sibling relationship spelled out in an unselfish act of head-shaving. Well, that's about all the time we have. I'd like to thank my brother Dr. Niles Crane for being here today. Niles, I would shave my head for you. "
"Niles: A gesture which becomes less significant with each passing year. "
"Frasier: This is Dr. Frasier Crane, I'll be back tomorrow. One Crane flying solo. "
"Niles: Frasier, we have hit the mother lode. We've got enough information here for two volumes I must aplogise for ever criticizing your radio program. "
"Frasier: Oh, it's all water under the pont-neuf. "
"Roz: I hate to break up the stroke-a-thon, but there's a Sam Tanaka on line one. "
"Frasier: Oh, hello Sam, you're on speakerphone. "
"Sam: I caught the show today, fellas. "
"Frasier: You did And? "
"Sam: Jackpot How's the writing coming? "
"Niles: Oh, incredible, it's just falling like water. We've got, what, two or three chapters already. "
"Sam: That's good to hear, because I just got off the phone with Reader’s Digest. They're interested in the serialization rights. I need first few chapters to give them a taste, can you fax them right over? "
"Frasier: Well, Sam Of course we could, but you know, they're a little rough, Sam. "
"Sam: No problem, you've got till Friday to polish them up. You can do that, right? "
"Niles: Absolutely "
"Frasier: Friday's fine "
"Sam: Terrific, I love you guys "
"Frasier: My God, what are we going to do? "
"Niles: Well now, let's remember we have all this material and now it's just a matter of putting it all together. "
"Frasier: It's due on Friday "
"Niles: We'll settle down and do it by Friday "
"Frasier: Wait, wait, I just remembered a story about George and Ira Gershwin when they had to meet a deadline. They would lock themselves in a hotel room, free from distractions, and not come out until their task was complete. "
"Niles: Brilliant If we get hot we'll not only finish this volume but we can write another chorus to 'Betsy Who Is My Woman Now.' "
"Time: 11"
":52) "
"Niles: It's clean, it's sparkling, it's mass-produced art, it's totally devoid of charm - it's perfect. Let's get to work. "
"Frasier: I'm with you, mon frere. We cannot be intimidated by the tyranny of a blank page. All we need to get a good start here is... Room Service "
"Niles: Frasier "
"Frasier: Niles, you're right All we need is a good opening sentence. Something that will smack the reader right between the eyes and then take him on a virtual roller-coaster ride of self awareness and discovery. "
"Niles: Frasier, while you were out there mixing metaphors like a Cuisinart, I've had a breakthrough. Voila Our opening sentence "
"Frasier: “From Romulus and Remus to the Le Nain Sisters, sibling relationships have sparked psychological debate throughout the world.” Interesting. "
"Niles: You like it? "
"Frasier: Well, I said it was interesting. The task ahead of us now is to decide whether we'd like an interesting opening or a good one. "
"Niles: You're just being negative because you didn't think of it first. "
"Frasier: No In truth I'm not. I never cared for Romulus, I never cared for Remus and the reference to the Le Nain Sisters is from the friggin' moon. "
"Niles: Well, alright, if you can do better, please be my guest. "
"Frasier: I will. "
"Niles: My fingers are poised over the keys... I'm waiting. "
"Niles: I'm still waiting "
"Frasier: Alright, alright, put this down 'The key to a good sibling relationship is the ability to be open and honest.' "
"Niles: That actually sounded good to me. "
"Frasier: Well, put that in there. "
"Niles: “The key to a good sibling relationship is the ability to be open and honest, while still respecting each other's boundaries.” "
"Frasier: What are you doing? What was that crap about boundaries? "
"Niles: I was just finishing the thought. "
"Frasier: The thought was finished. It didn't need finishing, for God's sake. Now it's a run-on sentence. "
"Niles: I think it's much better this way. "
"Frasier: Well, I don't "
"Niles: Well, I'm at the keyboard. "
"Frasier: Alright then, let me type "
"Niles: No, I can only write at the keyboard. "
"Frasier: Niles, you haven't written a thing all day, except to ruin a perfectly good opening sentence. "
"Niles: I was merely finishing it, it was an incomplete thought. "
"Frasier: You're an incomplete thought What happened to the iced tea? "
"Niles: I finished that too "
"Frasier: Niles, I've just had an epiphany. "
"Niles: Oh wonderful, we could use a second sentence. "
"Frasier: No, it's not for the book. I've just realised why so many writers become bloated alcoholic suicides. No, don't type that in. "
"Niles: I'm not, I'm adding up our tab from the mini-bar. We now owe... two hundred thirty-two dollars. "
"Frasier: Oh, Dear God "
"Niles: Well, you're the damn fool that ate the whole jar of Macadamia nuts "
"Frasier: No, it's dawn. It's Friday Oh Niles, why don't we just admit it. We can't work together, there's never going to be any book "
"Niles: Not with that attitude, there isn't. "
"Frasier: Oh, will you get off it Come on, the fat lady has sung The curtain has been run down here. I'll type it for you in capital letters "
"Niles: “IT'S UVER?” "
"Frasier: Let's just go home. "
"Niles: Well, I guess I shouldn't be surprised you'd give up so easily. It's not your dream, after all. Why should it be, Mr. Bigshot Radio Host? "
"Frasier: Oh, so that's what this little tantrum is all about, huh? You're jealous of my celebrity? "
"Niles: It's not a tantrum, and I'm not jealous. I'm just FED UP I'm fed up with being second all the time. You know, I wanted to be a psychiatrist like Mom way before you did, but because you were older you got there first. You were first to get married. You were first to give Dad the grandchild he always wanted. By the time I get around to doing anything, it's all chewed meat "
"Frasier: You're crying about something that we can't change "
"Niles: Oh, you wouldn't change it if you could, you love it "
"Frasier: Oh, let it go, Niles "
"Niles: I can't let it go My nose is rubbed in it every day I'm the one on the board of the Psychiatric Association, my research is well respected in academic circles, four of my patients have been elected to political office, but it's your big fat face they put on the side of buses "
"Frasier: I do not have a fat face "
"Niles: Oh please, I've been wondering how long you're going to store those nuts for winter "
"Frasier: Well, at least I'm not SPINDLY "
"Niles: Who you calling spindly, Fat Face? "
"Frasier: You, Spindly. "
"Niles: Fat Face "
"Frasier: Spindly "
"Niles: Fat Face "
"Frasier: Spindly "
"Niles: Fat Face "
"Frasier: You take that back "
"Niles: You make me. "
"Frasier: I will make you. "
"Niles: I don't see you making me. "
"Frasier: Well, here's making you... "
"Niles: OW "
"Niles: Here’s your fat face Gimme that- "
"Frasier: Gimme that- "
"Frasier: Niles Niles Stop it We're psychiatrists, not pugilists "
"Frasier: I can't believe you fell for that "
"Niles: My God, my God, I'm having a "
"flashback: you're climbing in my crib and jumping on me "
"Frasier: YOU STOLE MY MOMMY "
"Frasier: Oh my God, oh my God. Niles, I've gotta get out of here. This entire idea has been a fiasco since the start. It's the stupidest idea you ever had, I should never have agreed to it Goodbye "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Morning, all. "
"Martin: Morning. "
"Daphne: You seem cheerful this morning, Dr. Crane. "
"Frasier: Why shouldn't I be? "
"Martin: Well, it's going to rain again, jobless rate’s up, [Frasier bites into a muffin] and about two minutes ago Eddie was licking that muffin. "
"Daphne: Oh, I'll get it. "
"Frasier: Dad, the mark of a pure man is that one that realizes he can't control his circumstances, he can only control his response. "
"Martin: Have you talked to your brother yet? "
"Frasier: I do not have a brother I'm an only child "
"Daphne: Oh, hello Dr. Crane. "
"Niles: Hello Daphne, Dad. "
"Frasier: What are you doing here? "
"Niles: Dad, I would like you to convey a message from me to Frasier. "
"Martin: What makes you think I know where he is? "
"Niles: Tell him, he owes me half this hotel bill. Tell him I'll accept cash but no personal checks, as I know he has trouble writing things "
"Frasier: I'm not paying any of this "
"Niles: So, you're cheap as well as intellectually barren. "
"Frasier: And you're a no-talent hack. "
"Niles: And you look stupid in a t-shirt "
"Martin: Alright, that's enough. Sit down and listen to me. Sit down. I never had a brother, but I had a partner once, my first, Mitch Gussy. Big bear of a guy, arms like tree- trunks. Mitch and I would go to ball games together, we'd play cards, and this was after work with eight hours together... "
"Frasier: Dad, that's all very nice... "
"Martin: Just listen to me. Three months into our partnership, Gus and I got assigned to a stakeout. Three days in the front seat of a Chevy Nova together. Sitting up, drinking too much coffee. It didn't take long before we started getting on each other's nerves. "
"Niles: Because he was a big, egotistical fat-face? "
"Martin: Because we were human. He didn't like this about me, I didn't like that about him, so it got ugly. When the stakeout was over Gus requested a transfer and that was fine by me. Three months later, he was stabbed after breaking up a bar fight. By the time I got to the hospital, it was too late. "
"Martin: Take what you want from this story, guys. All I know is, it ain't worth it. "
"Daphne: Excuse me, I need a hanky. "
"Martin: Isn't there something you'd like to say to your brother? "
"Frasier: Yes Dad, I suppose there is. [holding the muffin Eddie "
"licked:] Niles, would you like a muffin? "
"Martin: Frasier "
"Frasier: Alright Niles, sorry things didn't work out with the book. You have no reason to feel inferior to me. You're an accomplished psychiatrist, a decent man, and you stand second to no-one. "
"Niles: Thank you Frasier. The truth is, I've always looked up to you and admired you. "
"Martin: Alright, enough of this mushy girly stuff. Just shake hands, punch each other on the shoulder and be done with it. "
"Frasier: Oh, what the heck "
"Martin: What are you crying about? "
"Daphne: I just keep thinking about poor Gus, it must be so hard on you carrying all that pain around. "
"Martin: There was no Gus, I just made him up. "
"Daphne: What? "
"Martin: Well, at least there's one good writer in this family. "

"Skyline: The Seattle sky line is drawn with no extras. "
"Frasier: Gee, I'm sorry, Blake. When I told you to close your eyes and visualize that you were on a tropical island, I didn't realize you were calling from your car phone. "
"Blake: That's OK, Doc. At least I know my airbags work. "
"Frasier: Well, I'm glad you're alright. And thank you for your call. "
"Frasier: Well, look who's popped into the booth It's Gil Chesterton, KACL's own food critic - which means, it's my cue to hit the road. So, till tomorrow, this is Dr. Frasier Crane, wishing you... and-and good health. "
"Gil: Hey, Frasier "
"Frasier: Hello, Gil. "
"Gil: I heard you coughing on the air earlier today. Sounds like you might be coming down with something. So I had this sent over from Rosenthal's Deli. Chicken soup, so lovingly prepared even the chicken gets well. "
"Frasier: Thank you. That's very kind. "
"Gil: And of course I'd never forget you, Roz. [hands her a smaller bag] Some ladyfingers, that have been soaked in rum. "
"Roz: Mmm "
"Frasier: Much like her own. "
"Gil: I say, I hope this isn't the start of that nasty flu that's going around. You want to take a couple of days off, nip it in the bud, I'd be happy to cover your time slot for you. "
"Frasier: No, no, thank you. I'll be fine tomorrow. "
"Gil: Okey-dokey. But, uh... feel free to call me if you change your mind. "
"Roz: Mmm Plump, gooey, and guaranteed to rot your teeth. "
"Frasier: Yes. I don't like his phony British accent much, either. "
"Roz: You sure got a bug up your mind about Gil. What's your problem? "
"Frasier: I just don't trust him. Nobody's that nice unless they want something from you. "
"Roz: He's just a generous person. "
"Frasier: Oh, yes He was very generous to Bonnie Weems Bought her a case of wine, asked her to let him have her timeslot when she was off on vacation. When she got back, she had been banished to the midnight to four a.m. slot "
"Roz: What are you saying? He's trying to take our timeslot? "
"Frasier: I'm just saying we should watch our backs. How would you like to work from midnight to four a.m.? What would happen to your social life? Those are your peak hours "
"Roz: You're just being paranoid. "
"Frasier: No, I'm not. "
"Roz: Yes, you are The man brought you some chicken soup. It does not mean he wants your timeslot. Besides, why would he be bribing us? He'd be bribing the higher-ups, they're the ones who make the decisions "
"Gil: Frasier Oh good, it's still here. I’m so sorry. This is your soup. [hands him the bag in his hand and takes the one off the console] This is the Lobster Newburg I bought for the station manager's cat. "
"Frasier: I'll see you tomorrow, Roz. "
"Daphne: Oh, here's a gruesome bit. A partly-decomposed body just washed up in Puget Sound "
"Martin: Hey, that's good news "
"Daphne: I beg your pardon? "
"Martin: Bodies don't rise till the weather gets warmer. You get your first floater, and spring's just around the corner "
"Frasier: Morning, Dad, Daphne. "
"Martin: Frasier, you sound awful "
"Frasier: It's just a little bug. "
"Daphne: But you can't be thinking of going to work You're all pasty and clammy and pale "
"Martin: And coming from an English person, that's bad "
"Frasier: Don’t worry, Dad. As you've often said, 'if you can walk, you can work.' Took kind of an ironic twist the day you got shot in the hip "
"Martin: Well, at least I had a real job. Half your listening audience hears voices already, and the other half talks to themselves If you don't show up, who's going to notice? "
"Frasier: Well, I'm out of here. "
"Daphne: But you're burning up You really should stay home and let me tend to you. I'm a very good nurse. I mended all my brothers' soccer injuries. "
"Frasier: Well, I didn't get injured playing soccer. "
"Daphne: Neither did my hooligan brothers. Mostly they got hurt beating up drunken Dutchmen in the stands. "
"Martin: Well, that's going to look pretty against the glass in your booth Why don't you just stay home? "
"Frasier: Dad, Daphne, thank you, thank you. But I'm a physician. I believe that I am the best monitor of my own condition. I'm fine Fit as a fiddle "
"Frasier: I'm sick... "
"TO: "
"Gil: And we’re back, with “Restaurant Beat.” This is Gil Chesterton and I'm filling in for Dr. Frasier Crane. We're here talking to Louis, who has forgotten that tonight is his tenth anniversary. Well, Louis, I believe I've saved your proverbial derriere During the commercial, I managed to secure you a private booth at Maximillian's. Just promise me for dessert you'll have their Schwarzwälder Kirschtorte. "
"Louis: The... the what? "
"Gil: The Schwarzwälder... well, maybe you'd better stick with the rainbow sherbet. "
"Louis: I don't know how to thank you. You saved my marriage "
"Gil: No, don't thank me I'm only here tonight because our dear Dr. Crane is home with the flu. "
"Gil: If you're listening, Doc, all of us here at KACL want you to get better soon. "
"Frasier: I just bet you do. "
"Daphne: Time to check if the turkey's done. [she takes out the thermometer] "
"Frasier: Dad, you know, you don't have to sit in here with me all day. "
"Martin: Oh no, no problem. You need company when you're sick. You never know when you're going to croak. "
"Daphne: Oh, boy. Your temperature is up there - one hundred and one You are a sick boy. "
"Frasier: Thank you for reminding me, Daphne. "
"Martin: Naw, I remember the sickest I ever was. They'd shipped us back from Korea. I got this Oriental parasite, that was building its own little pagoda right in my colon... "
"Frasier: Thank you, Dad. "
"Daphne: You know, you might try some of my homeopathic tea. It'll flush out your system, and it'll also make your hair more shiny and manageable. "
"Frasier: No, no thank you. "
"Martin: Oh, no That wasn't the sickest I was. It was that time Your mother and I took that trip down to Mexico. I was real careful about the water, and then I ate this piece of lettuce. Next thing you know, I'm spewing both for accuracy and distance. I spent the night curled up on the stone floor, screaming, 'I want to die, I want to die' "
"Frasier: Wouldn’t that have been a tragedy? You wouldn't be here with me now "
"Martin: OK, I get the point. I'll give you a little peace and quiet here. Oh, no What was I thinking of? What about the time your mother left the potato salad in the trunk of the car? I'm still sick from that one "
"Daphne: Is there anything else you need? "
"Frasier: A little more ginger ale, please. "
"Daphne: Very well, then. "
"Frasier: Oh Daphne, this time make it shaved ice, not cubes. And I don't like those straws. Can I have the bendy kind? And the saltines, they're too salty. I need the low-sodium. "
"Daphne: Your wish is my command. "
"Niles: Hello, Daphne. Is he in pain? "
"Daphne: Not enough. "
"Niles: Frasier, I brought you something. "
"Frasier: Niles Put the hanky down, for God's sake It's not the plague "
"Niles: Well, look. This is from Marta, our maid. It's a poultice you wear around your neck. The recipe comes from her remote mountain village in Guatemala. "
"Frasier: I can see why her village is remote "
"Niles: Well yes, it is pungent. But, by inhaling these herbs, many of the villagers live to be well over a hundred. Marta herself is seventy-eight, and you should see her scramble up the stairs when Maris rings her little bell. "
"Frasier: Oh, Niles, would you mind? "
"Niles: Of course. "
"Frasier: Oh, hello Eddie For once I'm actually glad to see you Here. "
"Niles: Uh, it's for you. It's - Roz? "
"Frasier: Hello. "
"Roz: So, how are you feeling? "
"Frasier: Awful, thank you. "
"to: we see Roz standing at the payphone outside the studio, "
"Roz: Well, I'm sorry to hear that. Because I really think you should get your butt back down here. You were right about Gil, Frasier. He's lobbying for our slot. I was talking to Millie in Traffic and she overheard Gil talking to the station manager. It was all about how our timeslot is perfect for his show because it's mid-afternoon and everyone is making [posh accent] dinner plans "
"Frasier: I knew it, I knew it Geez... OK, Roz, you can count on me. I'll be there tomorrow. "
"Roz: Well, you'd better be I don't trust that greedy, finger- Licking runt as far as I can throw him. "
"Gil: I say, Roz, how am I doing so far? "
"Roz: Fabulous "
"to: Frasier’s room. "
"Frasier: OK, I'll be in tomorrow. "
"Niles: Frasier, you can't be serious about going in tomorrow. Your pupils are dilated. You have a fever. "
"Niles: You go in in that condition, you won't even make it to the... "
"Frasier: Oh, I just don't trust Gil Chesterton. I think he's after my timeslot. Oh Niles, will you stop it with the alcohol "
"Frasier: I just can't let that smarmy little chowhound do my show for another day Oh God, anybody would be better [inspiration strikes] Niles, Niles, would you do my show for me? "
"Niles: Frasier, I think that fever of yours is making you delusional. "
"Frasier: Oh, no I filled in for you when you were too sick to meet with your 'Fear of Intimacy' group "
"Niles: I wasn't sick. They were just getting too close. "
"Frasier: Oh, I guess you're right. It's probably a bad idea. Doing my show requires a set of abilities that you just don't possess. You have to be able to size up your patients very quickly, and then dispense your advice in an entertaining and insightful manner. "
"Niles: Frasier, this pathetic attempt at reverse psychology is beneath you. "
"Frasier: Then you're not going to do my show? "
"Niles: No, I AM going to do your show, and I'm going to do it better than you ever DREAMED of doing it "
"TO: "
"Roz: And here's the cough button in case you need to cough or clear your throat. And most important, here's an extra-long commercial to use if you need a bathroom break. "
"Niles: Thank you, but those won't be necessary. I have no cough reflex, and excellent bladder control. "
"Roz: It's true - all the good ones ARE married. You're on in ten seconds and your first caller is Marcia. "
"Niles: Marcia... "
"Niles: 'Hello, Marcia, I'm listening.' That is so trite. 'Hello, Marcia, tell me where it hurts.' No, no... “Hello, Marcia, I hear you.' No... "
"Roz: Good afternoon, Seattle "
"Niles: Oh, yes Hello This is Dr. Niles Crane, filling in for my ailing brother, Dr. Frasier Crane. Although I feel perfectly qualified to fill Frasier's radio shoes, I should warn you that while Frasier is a Freudian, I am a Jungian. So there'll be no blaming Mother today. "
"Niles: Ooh-kay, Roz, who's my first caller? "
"Roz: We have Marcia on line three. She's in love with her husband's brother. "
"Niles: This day promises not to disappoint. [jabs a button professionally] Hello, Marcia. “Let's get better” "
"to: Frasier's bedroom. He is listening to the radio as "
"Niles: But before we get into the specifics of your problem, why don't I give you a little historical background? The psychiatrist Sigmar Bromnoh - that's B-R-O-M-N-O-H - in the late 1950s, wrote extensively on the problem you are facing. Which is all the more amazing when you realise that Bromnoh was a prominent Reichian, although... "
"Frasier: Listen to him He's terrible "
"Daphne: And, I'm afraid, so are you. Your temperature's up to one hundred and three. "
"Frasier: Oh, it could go up to a hundred and five, I couldn't be better My timeslot is safe. Niles is as dry as this toast you brought me - with the crust still on. I'm sure when I’m ready to go back, they'll send a limo "
"Daphne: Well, I'll just go get you another drink. Was that last straw bendy enough? "
"Frasier: Perfect, thank you. Oh Daphne, Daphne, look. Here, take these tissues away. I, they hurt my nose. I want that kind with the little moisturizer droplet between the sheets. And the rose petals in the humidifier - I think they're starting to wilt. "
"Daphne: Oh, of course. Anything you like. Fresh rose petals, crust-less toast, soft tissues... [turning to leave, muttering bitterly] acupuncture needles where you least expect them... "

"Niles: Howard, Lois, I could stay on the air counseling you all day, but– we’re coming to the end of our hour, so I'm just going to cut to the quick. If one of you doesn't say, 'I love you' right now - right now - frankly, I don't see how you could have any kind of future together. So, which of you has the courage to say, 'I love you?” "
"Lois: Howard... I love you. "
"Niles: Yes Yes Howard, she loves you What about you? "
"Howard: I, uh... "
"Niles: Howard? Are you going to just pack up your emotional tent and walk away... Howard? Howard, it's up to you Can you say it? Can you? "

"Daphne: He said it, he said it "
"Niles: But I’m afraid we’re going to have to interrupt this radio moment with a commercial... [Daphne turns off the radio] "
"Martin: Hey, Niles is pretty good "
"Frasier: Good? Good? The little rat is scintillating Oh, why couldn't he just do what's expected of him for once and stink? He's even better than Gil Chesterton Oh, God - they're trying to make me look bad "
"Martin: Aw, geez. This high temperature of yours is making you zooey. "
"Frasier: No No It's made me clear-headed. I’ve gotta get down there, go to that station, reclaim what's rightfully mine "
"Frasier: There'll be no more filling in by anybody No way, no how No way, no... "
"Martin: Frasier, you're not going anywhere. "
"Frasier: Oh, who's going to stop me? "
"Martin: I am. "
"Frasier: Oh, how are you - a man with a limp and a cane - going to stop a man in the prime of his life? "
"Martin: And I wasn't even leaning on my cane. Come on, Daphne. "
"Daphne: Boy, he really is sick. "
"Martin: Huh You want to talk sick? 1962, World's Fair. The Tilt-A- Whirl was right next to the “Little Taste Of India”... "
"TO: "
"Frasier: As you know, I was out sick most of the week, and I'd like to take this opportunity to express my sincere gratitude to Gil Chesterton and to my brother Niles for doing such a great job of filling in for me. "
"Frasier: I really appreciate it, guys. "
"Frasier: Well Roz, now that I'm back to normal and feeling great, who's our first caller? "
"Roz: We have Sonya from Auburn on line three. "
"Frasier: Let's just hear what Sonya has to say... A bomb under his chair "
"TO: Frasier’s Bedroom "
"Frasier: DAPHNE DAPHNE "
"Daphne: What is it this time? "
"Frasier: I had a dream I had a dream They are plotting against me "
"Daphne: Oh, now now, Dr. Crane. I thought we went over this already. It's just your fever talking "
"Frasier: Oh, that's just what you want me to think You're probably in league with Niles I know about the two of you Oh, you pretend not to know, but you know In fact, "
"Frasier: I’ve gotta get back down there and take my show back "
"Daphne: But you can barely function "
"Frasier: Yes, well, these prescriptions will take care of that and more. Now here, run down to the drugstore, post-haste "
"Daphne: Syducane? This'll have you high as a kite "
"Frasier: That's only until I take a couple of these "
"Daphne: Oh now, Dr. Crane, I really don't think you're in any shape... "
"Frasier: Thank you But the moment I give a fig for what you think is the day that England produces a great chef, a world-class bottle of wine, and a car that has a decent electrical system "
"Daphne: You know, being a health-care provider, I try to be sympathetic towards my patients. But I have reached the end of my tether with you, Doctor You are by far the most ungrateful, disagreeable, self-centered, whiny fusspot I've ever had the misfortune of dealing with I've had patients on their deathbeds who were more considerate, and a damn sight more jolly too As far as I'm concerned, you can lay in those sweaty sheets until you're one giant bedsore "
"Frasier: Are you done? "
"Daphne: Yes. "
"Frasier: Then scurry on down to the drugstore and get those filled while I get dressed "
"TO: "
"Gil: Oh, Frasier What a surprise to see you here today "
"Frasier: Well, it's no wonder. I've taken some wonder drugs, I feel wonderful So I'm going to go do my show now - so ta-ta, Pieman "
"Niles: Thank you, Greta. It's always satisfying to know I've changed someone's life. Oh, look who's just wandered into my booth, it's my brother Frasier. "
"Frasier: Hello, Niles. I've come to take back the reins of my show, so you can just scoot out of there. "
"Niles: I think this might be a good time to go to a commercial. This is Dr. Niles Crane, “let's get better.” "
"Roz: You OK, Frasier? Your eyes look a little glassy. "
"Frasier: I'm fine It's just that the drugs I took have some minor slide effects... "
"Roz: Frasier, look at me. Do you see trails when I do this? "
"Frasier: Whoa Ha It wasn't doing that before "
"Niles: Listen, you're not going on the air like this. [shakes a finger in Frasier’s face] Stop it, stop... "
"Niles: This is what you're going to do. You're going to bed, you're going to get rest, and you're going to get rid of this fever, so you can be as good as new. “Let's get better” All right? All right? "
"Frasier: All right... OK... "
"Frasier: Maybe... maybe the two of you could help me find someone to drive me home? "
"Roz: Oh, that's the most sensible thing you've said so far, Frasier- "
"Roz: Frasier FRASIER "
"Frasier: Hello, Seattle, I'm back This is Dr. Frasier Crane. I promise I will never leave you again... so, let's take our first caller. Hello, I'm listening. "
"Robert: Hi, Dr. Crane. Thanks for taking my call. I'm a little nervous, okay? My name is Robert. "
"Frasier: And your name is? "
"Robert: ...My name is Robert. "
"Frasier: Oh, I'm sorry. We've already had a Robert on the show today. Goodbye "
"Roz: Tony, it's Roz. Could you get security up here? Captain Kirk's got control of the bridge and he's gone insane. "
"air: "
"Frasier: Who is this? "
"Janice: I'm Janice. "
"Frasier: Well, Janice, what's your problem? "
"Janice: Well, I'm having a problem breaking through a barrier with my in-laws. "
"Frasier: Boring "
"Frasier: Hello You're on the crane with Frasier Air "
"Marjorie: Hi, Dr. Crane. This is Marjorie. You see, I'm... I'm having a problem with my boss. He doesn't seem to respect me, and I don't have the courage to confront him. "
"Frasier: OK, OK, Marjorie. Well, let's, let's see... Let's do a little role-playing, OK? Look, I'll be your boss, you be yourself, you be Marjorie... and uh - come on in and talk to me in a very forceful way. Tell me what you think, and you just might be surprised by what happens "
"Marjorie: Well, OK. 'Listen, Mr. Ross. I've worked for this company for six years and I've never missed a day. But you've constantly promoted people less qualified than I am, and I don't think that's fair.' "
"Frasier: 'Well, Marjorie, I must say I admire your forthrightness, and uh... I wished more of my employees came and spoke to me with an open mind. You know, you're going to get that promotion' "
"Marjorie: Hey, that was great "
"Frasier: Yeah Wasn't it? Wasn't it? OK, it's my turn I'm Marjorie and you're the boss now Come on Come on... "
"Niles: Frasier, these nice men are going to take your home. "
"Frasier: I'm - I'm, I'm doing my show [a guard takes the headphones off his ears] I can't I'm on the air "
"Roz: No, you're not. We cut you off. You're on commercial. "
"Niles: Don't you worry your little mucous-filled head about anything. Everything's under control. "
"Frasier: But it’s my show, it's my booth... Hey, this is fun Ha Make it go faster Whee "
"Roz: Five seconds, Niles "
"Niles: Hello This is Dr. Niles Crane again and no, we haven't taken leave of our senses. That bit of inspired lunacy you heard just before the commercial was just a little docudrama Frasier and I put together on the dangers of over-medication. "
"Niles: Bravo, Frasier, for so brilliantly demonstrating why they call it “dope” "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Daphne Daphne "
"Daphne: Whaaat? "
"Frasier: I had another dream I dreamt I went down to the station all doped-up and tried to take over my show and made a big fool out of myself, and they-they dragged me out of there like a lunatic in a butterfly net "
"Daphne: Now, now, that was just a dream. You go back to sleep. You'll feel better in the morning. "
"Frasier: Oh, Daphne. Can I have a little lemonade? With fresh lemons and maybe a little sprig of mint? "
"Daphne: Anything you want. "
"Martin: Why'd you tell him it was a dream? "
"Daphne: No fun telling him the truth now, when he’s all doped up. I'll wait till tomorrow morning - when he's good and lucid. "
"Time: 22"

"Niles: Calm down, dear. No, calm down, listen, take a left, then the second right, then a left again. "
"Frasier: Is Maris lost again? "
"Niles: Yes, she wandered into the kitchen by mistake. I had to talk her back to the living room. "
"Frasier: It's kinda busy, any chance of getting a table? "
"Niles: Not at the moment. The table by the window received their check five minutes ago but they have been sitting there yammering away every since. I've been shooting them dirty looks, but they haven't budged. "
"Frasier: Show me the look. "
"Frasier: They're there for a while. "
"Niles: Meantime, shall we go ahead and order? "
"Frasier: Oh why not? What are your coffees today? "
"Waitress: Zimbabwe and Kenya. "
"Frasier: I'll have a Zimbabwe latte. "
"Niles: I'll have a Kenyan cappuccino. "
"Frasier: So, what's new? "
"Niles: Well, Yoshi the gardener finally won the battle of the wills. He got Maris to dig up her camellias so he could put in that precious Zen garden that he's been hocking us about since last fall. "
"Frasier: How did that turn out? "
"Niles: Oh, it's beautiful, it's the perfect place for meditation. Yesterday, I found Maris smack-dab in the middle sitting in the lotus position. "
"Frasier: Well good for her, apparently it's bringing out her spiritual side. "
"Niles: I'm not sure, she reading a Danielle Steel novel, making a nail appointment on her cellular phone. "
"Frasier: Do you realize that today marks a year since I moved here from Boston? "
"Niles: Really? A year It seems like yesterday dad moved in with you. "
"Frasier: Isn't funny how two people can have distinct, opposite impressions of the same event? "
"Niles: They are both sitting there as if they own that table. Maybe if we both gave them the look. "
"Frasier: It's worth a try. Niles, I'll never doubt you again "
"Niles: Try the look on this table, I'm going to the men’s room. "
"Niles: Maddening "
"Frasier: What is it now? "
"Niles: They have a new moisturizer dispenser in the men’s room, and the cream is entirely too oily, so I had to rewash my hands, and would you know it, that is when the hot-air hand dryer decides to break down "
"Frasier: How do you get through the day? "
"Waitress: Here we go, Zimbabwe and Kenyan. "
"Frasier: Oh, excuse me, did I say decaf? "
"Waitress: No, you didn't. "
"Frasier: Oh, I'm sorry. If I drink the regular it'll keep me tossing and turning all through my brother's conversation. [she takes it] Well Niles, it doesn't look like anybody is leaving, why don't we take a table outside? "
"Niles: Why not, I'm feeling al fresco. "
"Frasier: Oh, how does Mrs. Fresco feel about that? "
"Frasier: It must be a riot on camping trips "
"Niles: Would you like a...? "
"Niles: So, Frasier, now that chapter two of your life is in full swing, do you mind if I ask you something? "
"Frasier: No, go right ahead. "
"Niles: Are you happy? "
"Niles: Did you hear the question? "
"Frasier: Yes, I'm thinking. It's a seemingly complex question. "
"Niles: No, it's not. "
"Frasier: Yes, it is. "
"Niles: No, it's not. Either you're happy or you're not. "
"Frasier: Are you happy? "
"Niles: No, but we're not talking about me. "
"Frasier: Oh, let's not just gloss over that. You, my only brother, has just told me you're not happy and it pains me to hear that, so why? "
"Niles: I was watching PBS the other night in my study and they were showing this documentary on the Great Depression. Vintage Steinbeck - desperately poor people escaping the Dust Bowl, their meager possessions strapped to rickety old trucks heading to what they thought was their salvation. Then there was this scene with this scruffy boy being handed a brand-new pair of shoes by the Salvation Army. Frasier, if you saw the look on that boy's face. It was a look of pure and utter happiness. I have never experienced that kind of happiness, not in my whole life. Not even when I bought these four hundred dollar Bruno Maglies. Do you like them? "
"Frasier: Do you like them? "
"Niles: What about the tassels? "
"Frasier: Well, I'm not much of a tassel guy. "
"Niles: No, neither am I, nevertheless there they are. Oh, I have no reason to be unhappy. I have my health, have a wonderful home, a beautiful wife... did your eyebrow just move? "
"Frasier: I don't think so. "
"Niles: I've got my practice. Although, lately I've lost track of the ideals that led me to psychiatry in the first place. "
"Frasier: Hmm, yes. "
"Niles: Look who I'm talking to. Psychiatry's answer to the drive- through window. You know, sometimes I wonder if I'm not just in psychiatry for the money. "
"Frasier: Oh, I wouldn't say that's true. In a word... forget it. "
"Niles: What were you going to say? "
"Frasier: I'd rather not. "
"Niles: Well, there's no need, I think I know what you were getting at. You've been wanting to ask me this for "
"years: did I marry Maris for the money? I resent that I did not marry Maris for the money. It was just a delightful bonus. "
"Frasier: So, you really do love her? "
"Niles: Of course I love her. But it's a different kind of love. "
"Frasier: You mean it's not human? "
"Niles: No, no, I mean it doesn't burn with the passion and intensity of a Tristan and Isolde. It's more comfortable, more familiar. Maris and I are old friends. We can spend an afternoon together - me at my jigsaw puzzle, she at her auto-harp - not a word spoken between us and be perfectly content. "
"Frasier: I'm told it was a lot like that near the end in the Hitler household. "
"Niles: Oh fine, let's shift this subject back to where it belongs. This whole thing started with me asking whether you were happy. And don't think about it this time, just answer. "
"Frasier: Aw, well... "
"Roz: Hey, guys "
"Frasier: Hi, Roz. "
"Niles: Hello, Roz. What are you doing here? "
"Roz: Well, I always wanted to learn to fly a jet and today they're offering a special on jet flying lessons, so I thought I'd come by and take advantage of it. [Niles doesn't understand.] I came to get coffee "
"Niles: Well, thanks for stopping by, I'd have been mad if you didn't. "
"Roz: I'm also meeting someone here. "
"Frasier: Oh, let me guess, a man? "
"Roz: Yes. "
"Frasier: Yes. "
"Roz: The new guy from the news department, Andy Winslow. He's really cute. He caught me checking him out when he was bending over the water fountain. "
"Frasier: Ah Love at first sight "
"Roz: Anyway, he said why don't we get some coffee and get to know each other? I don't know Frasier, I've got a strange feeling that this guy might be the one. "
"Frasier: Oh, Roz, honey, you say that about every guy you meet. Let's just see if this one calls back. "
"Roz: Yeah. I guess, you know, I don't think he's here yet. I'll just go and snag a table. "
"Frasier: Good Luck "
"Niles: Bye, Roz. "
"Roz: Yeah. "
"Niles: I don't think she likes me. "
"Frasier: Niles, it isn't a question of liking or not liking. She despises you "
"Niles: Really? Why should I warrant such strong emotions? I barely acknowledge her existence. "
"Frasier: I think you may be onto something there, Sherlock "
"Niles: She is comely, in a back-alley sort of way. "
"Frasier: Roz, yes she's very attractive. "
"Niles: Do you ever think about you two, you know... "
"Frasier: Roz and me? No "
"Niles: You've never fantasized about stealing away to a cheap little motel with her? "
"Frasier: Oh well, I'm a normal man with normal urges. She does have a silk blouse that falls open a bit when she leans over the cart rack. But mixing work with romance, I don't know, is it ever worth it? "
"Niles: I don't know, you tell me. You're the one who looked down her blouse "
"Waitress: Decaf Zimbabwe Latte. "
"Frasier: Is that non-fat milk? "
"Waitress: No. "
"Frasier: Oh, I hate to be a bother, it's just that I'm watching my fat intake. "
"Niles: What is that? Rain? "
"Frasier: No, God is crying "
"Niles: I asked a simple question. "
"Frasier: Do you ask any other kind? "
"Frasier: Good work there, Niles "
"Niles: I think I just wanted it a little more than he did. [looking out of the "
"window:] Boy, it's really coming down. [Frasier looks out and begins laughing.] What? What? "
"Frasier: Oh, just something that happened the other morning. I asked dad to pass me a bran muffin. You know what he said to me? He said, 'What's the magic word?' "
"Niles: You're kidding. "
"Frasier: He didn't think it was very amusing when I said 'rest home' "
"Niles: Oh look, look, that must be Roz's coffee companion. Wow He's really handsome, isn't he? "
"Frasier: ”Wow” Did you say “Wow?” "
"Niles: Good lord, I did. I've never said 'Wow' when describing another man before. I wonder if that means something. "
"Frasier: Oh, absolutely. It means you're a gay man. Your life with Maris was a charade and you should have come out of the closet years ago. Are you going to tell dad or shall I? "
"Martin: This was stupid, this whole thing was stupid, admit it. "
"Daphne: It was not stupid You needed your exercise. What was stupid was you came out without your bumbershoot "
"Martin: It's called an umbrella Speak English, can’t you? "
"Waitress: I'm sorry, sir, no dogs allowed. "
"Martin: What? "
"Waitress: Oh, I'm sorry. "
"Niles: It's okay, okay. "
"Martin: Niles? "
"Niles: Hello, dad. "
"Frasier: So, dad, what are you two doing here? "
"Daphne: Well, I thought we needed some exercise, and I had to come down here to pick up some beans anyway, so we walked. Well, two of us walked. One of us had to be dragged by his collar. "
"Martin: Hey, I told you I didn't want to come here in the first place. Look at me, I'm going to die of pneumonia. "
"Daphne: Oh, you'll outlive us all. The cranky ones always do. "
"Frasier: Dad, let's get you something hot to drink. [Frasier summons the waitress] Em, cappuccino, latte? "
"Waitress: Can I help you? "
"Martin: Coffee, black, and don't put anything fancy in it. "
"Waitress: We have two special coffees. I'll surprise you. "
"Frasier: Oh, joy. There's nothing like the smell of a wet dog to work up the appetite for supper "
"Martin: Look at us, we're soaked to the skin "
"Frasier: You're in a fine mood today "
"Martin: Ah, and by the way you left a mess in the kitchen. "
"Frasier: I had a piece of toast "
"Martin: Yeah, and you didn't use a plate like I asked you too, and you put it in under the counter. [Niles sits down with his briefcase] And all because you left a bunch a crumbs and toast sweat there "
"Niles: Toast sweat? "
"Frasier: Yes, yes, it's when you put a piece of hot toast on any surface, and it leaves droplets of dew behind. Haven't you heard dad's lecture on the evils of toast sweat? It's the scourge of our times. "
"Waitress: One coffee, black. "
"Waitress: And a decaf, non-fat, Zimbabwee Latte. "
"Frasier: Oh dear, is that cinnamon on that foam? "
"Frasier: Well you know, as long as we're picking at each other's scabs here, I found another one of Eddie's chew toys in my sweater cubby the other day, hairs all over my favorite pullover. I know he sleeps in there when I'm not home "
"Martin: It serves you right for keeping your sweaters in a place called 'the cubby.' "
"Frasier: That's it, my bedroom is off limits to this fleabag. "
"Martin: He's not a flea bag. "
"Niles: Hey dad, how about those Mariners? "
"Martin: Shut up, Niles. Look, who's kidding here? If my hip’s good enough to get me down here, then maybe it's about time I found a place of my own. "
"Niles: Where will you go? "
"Martin: Oh, don't worry about me, I'll find a place. I've got a little money saved up. I never wanted to move in with you in the first place, and the last thing I want to do is... "
"Frasier: ...“to be a burden to anybody.” "
"Martin: That's your brother's smart-ass way of telling me he's heard this before. Well, you won't have to hear it again, come on Eddie. Tell Daphne to catch up with us, will you? "
"Frasier: Dad, please, we go through this little melodrama at least once a week. Will you just sit down, it's raining outside. "
"Martin: No, no. I'll pay for coffee too, how much is it? "
"Frasier: A dollar-fifty. "
"Martin: For coffee? What kind of world are we living in? "
"Time: 12"
":35) "
"Niles: Frasier, are you alright? You've been in there forever. "
"Frasier: Oh, I tried that damn hand cream, [wipes his hand on serviette] I was so oily I couldn't get a grip on the doorknob. I awaited to be rescued, finally when some guy came in I said, 'Oh God, am I glad to see you.' I can't even begin to describe the look he gave me. "
"Frasier: There it is "
"Daphne: So, your brother tells me you and your father are at it again. "
"Frasier: Oh yeah, what's new? "
"Daphne: I don't know what's wrong with him. Lately, he's had a face as long as a wet weekend. Yesterday, when I insisted he do his exercises, he told me to put my feet behind my head and spin like a top. [Niles begins to fantasize about this] "
"Frasier: Oh well, best thing to do, just ignore him when he gets sarcastic. Isn't that right, Niles? Niles? "
"Niles: I'm sorry, Frasier. For some reason I feel a little dizzy. "
"Daphne: Well, I guess I better go after him. "
"Niles: Oh, here. Take my bumbershoot. "
"Daphne: Oh, isn't that nice. Well, at least someone appreciates my mother tongue. "
"Niles: Yes, I've always had an ear for your tongue. "
"Frasier: Niles "
"Niles: What did I say? Want another coffee? "
"Frasier: Not until I've had my first one, thanks [Niles signals for another coffee] Why is it always so difficult between me and dad? "
"Niles: Oh well, you might try looking at it from dad's point of view. As a policeman in a position of authority and that's been taken away from him. Wailing against the world is his way of controlling his ever-shrinking sphere of influence. "
"Frasier: Yes I do empathize with him. I just can't help wishing I could just kick that cane out from under him once in a while and that he would land on Eddie "
"Niles: Well, the simple truth is, it's hard. I know you're trying "
"Frasier: I am And you know, sometimes I do see the fruits of my labor. You know, just the other night dad was watching TV and I had fallen asleep on the couch and suddenly I stirred, I felt something on my head, and dad was standing above me stroking my hair. "
"Niles: Dad? Did he say anything? "
"Frasier: Well, he said, 'don't think it's time you got a hair cut, you're starting to look like bozo' I know he was only covering though. But what do you think? "
"Niles: Probably wouldn't hurt to get a trim "
"Frasier: No Do you think he was covering? "
"Niles: Of course he was covering, you know dad Tough as nails on the outside, but on the inside one giant... spike. "
"Niles: Grazie. "
"Frasier: Excuse me, but what about mine? "
"Waitress: We've got a team of specialists working on it. "
"Frasier: Look, why don't we just change the subject from dad, and talk about something else. "
"Niles: Absolutely, pick a new topic. Something light and frothy. "
"Frasier: I agree. Are you in love with Daphne? "
"Frasier: That's a little frothier than I had in mind "
"Niles: That preposterous I refuse to dignify that question with an answer. "
"Niles: I don't know There, I said it. There, are you happy? Oh, why did you have to hire Venus herself? Couldn't you have found some beefy, East-European scrub woman who reeked of ammonia? "
"Frasier: Well, I asked, but it was an Olympic year. The agency was fresh out. "
"Niles: Frasier, I can't get her out of my mind. When I look at Daphne she stirs a passion in me I've never known before. "
"Frasier: Niles, you're not considering leaving Maris? "
"Niles: Certainly not "
"Frasier: Well, I suppose the situation you're in is that you'd like to stay with Maris but you'd like an affair with Daphne. "
"Niles: Yes. Can I do that? "
"Frasier: No, you can't "
"Niles: I thought that I couldn't but you got my hopes up there for a minute. Oh, it's easy for you. You're free, you're happy - although perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself there, you haven't answered that question yet. "
"Frasier: Oh, I haven't answered it, have I? "
"Niles: You haven't and I'm getting curious. Are you happy? "
"Frasier: Well, I guess the best way I can think of saying it is... "
"Roz: This sucks "
"Frasier: What's the matter? "
"Roz: You sit down with someone and have a cup of coffee and think that they might just might lead you to something, like a life Suddenly the trap door opens and you're right back in Roz's world "
"Niles: How did it go wrong so quickly? "
"Roz: Hmm, simple. He didn't want to date me. He wanted to convert me I don't have anything against religious people. I don't care if they're Jewish, or Jehovah Witness or Buddhist. I am ecumenical, I embrace men of all faiths "
"Frasier: If only it stopped there "
"Roz: But he pretended he was going to ask me out, isn't there a Commandment against that? "
"Niles: No, they didn't get into dating until the New Testament. "
"Frasier: Oh, I'm sorry Roz, why don't you join us? "
"Roz: No, no thank you. There's a cute new handyman in my building. I thought I'd just go home, slip into a negligée and rip out my faucet. "
"Frasier: You think she's kidding, don't you? You know, I think about Roz's life and it makes me wonder about my own. I haven't been exactly burning up the social scene lately. "
"Niles: You'll find somebody. "
"Frasier: But what if I don't? What if I end up old and alone? I just might have to buy a funny little dog and move in With Frederick. I guess I don't need to worry about that for a while. "
"Niles: No, Frederick should start worrying about it. In the meantime, you might want to answer my ever-more-tedious original question. Are you happy? "
"Frasier: Well, I guess I'd have to say... "
"Martin: Hello, boys. "
"Niles: Oh, for Pete's sake "
"Frasier: Hello dad, what are you doing back here? "
"Martin: I don't know. I've been acting like a jerk these past couple of days, and I've been taking it out on you and Daphne. You know all that stuff I said earlier? Just forget about it. "
"Frasier: I already have. "
"Martin: Come on, boy. "
"Frasier: Dad, dad, listen. Has something been bothering you these past few days? "
"Martin: No, not really, no. "
"Frasier: Come on, say it. "
"Martin: Okay. Last Sunday was my birthday. "
"Niles: Of course it was Frasier and I were planning a big surprise party. But, if we threw it on your birthday it wouldn't have been a surprise, thus we waited a week. So, surprise "
"Niles: Oh, if you could just see the look on your face... "
"Frasier: Just give it up, Niles Dad, I'm sorry. Listen, come and have a seat. "
"Martin: You know, I don't know why I let it bother me. All those years on the force, I missed enough of you boys' birthdays. You're entitled to miss one of mine. "
"Frasier: You know what, there's no reason to stop us celebrating anyway. Tonight, we'll take you out for dinner. "
"Martin: You don't need to do that "
"Niles: Absolutely, absolutely, you name the place. "
"Martin: OK, how about Hoppy's Old Heidleberg? "
"Martin: They were voted best bratwurst of all time for three years in a row. "
"Frasier: Ach du lieber "
"Daphne: There you are. I've been up and down Third Street looking for you. "
"Martin: Oh, I was on Fourth Street, Eddie had already smelled everything on Third. How did you know I was coming back here anyway? "
"Daphne: I had one of my psychic flashes. Bang - there you were, walking through the door of Café Nervosa. And there you were, apologizing for the way you've treated me this past week. "
"Martin: Yeah, I'm sorry about that, Daphne. Just forget about it, alright? "
"Daphne: And something about a raise. "
"Martin: You're winging it now, aren't you? "
"Daphne: Am I that transparent? "
"Martin: No, I'm psychic. Come on, we've gotta hurry up because the boys are taking us to Hoppy's Old Heidleberg tonight for dinner "
"Daphne: Oh great, German food. We whipped the Jerries twice this century and they still have the last laugh. "
"Frasier: You know, dad I'd give you a ride, but I've got to stop by the station first. "
"Martin: Nah. "
"Niles: No, that's okay, I'll give him a lift. "
"Frasier: Ah. "
"Niles: Frasier, as always I've enjoyed getting together with you for coffee. "
"Martin: What do you guys talk about all the time? "
"Niles: Oh, you know - sports, chicks, monster truck rallies... "
"Martin: Okay, don't tell me. "
"Waitress: Zimbabwe, decaf, non-fat milk, no cinnamon in sight. Now - ARE YOU HAPPY? "
"Frasier: You know, in the greater scheme... yes, I'd say I am. "
"Time: 22"

"Frasier: Hello Steven, I'm listening. "
"Steven: Well, you see Dr. Crane, my wife Tracy and I are having a baby and I know we're getting a little ahead of ourselves. But there seems to be a lot of different advice about whether it's okay to let your kid climb into bed with you in the morning. "
"Frasier: Ah Stop right there, Steven. It's okay. All relationships require that kind of close and undivided attention. Isn't that so, Roz? "
"Roz: Uh-huh. "
"Steven: But what if you and your wife enjoy, you know, making love in the morning? "
"Frasier: Trust me, after the baby comes that won't be an issue anymore. This is Dr. Frasier Crane on KACL. We'll be back after these messages. "
"Frasier: Roz How can you be reading now? "
"Roz: Oh, I don't know, it's something I picked up in elementary school and it stuck. "
"Frasier: Just what is it that's so captivating? "
"Roz: 'Slow Tango in South Seattle.” "
"Frasier: Oh God, not you too Why is that every woman I see is carrying that book around? "
"Roz: Because it's impossible to put down. Just read the first paragraph. I guarantee you'll be hooked. "
"Frasier: 'There are tangos that come flowing from the wine seas, from the rust of a hundred sunken ships. This is one of those dances.' "
"Roz: Well? "
"Frasier: There are books that make your stomach lurch and thrust your lunch ever upwards. This is one of those books "
"Roz: You men are all alike, you have no soul. "
"Frasier: Oh... "
"Roz: Except for this one. [points to author’s picture on back of "
"book:] The future Mr. Roz "
"Doyle: Thomas Jay Fallow. "
"Frasier: Oh my God, it's him "
"Roz: What? Do you know him? "
"Frasier: Yes. Yes, he used to drop into a neighborhood bar I frequented back in Boston. He's a bit pretentious, though; he stuck out like a sore thumb. "
"Roz: You used to drink with Thomas Jay Fallow? "
"Frasier: Well, actually I spent a lot of my time helping him get through his writer's block. In future I'll remember to use my powers for good and not for evil. "
"Roz: Well, I don't care what you think about him, he's coming here to the station tomorrow to be on Amber Edwards's 'Book Chat' and you're going to introduce us. "
"Frasier: Oh, no, no, no, no, I can't see him. I'll have to tell him how much I liked his book. You know how hard it is to lie to someone's face. "
"Roz: Oh no, it's easy for someone as bright and charming and articulate as you. "
"Frasier: Well, then perhaps you're right. "
"Roz: See how easy it is? "
"Daphne: Eight... nine... Stop it, Eddie "
"Martin: Oh, he just wants to play, huh boy? "
"Daphne: Yeah, well, therapy is not a game Stop it Stop it, I said. If he keeps this up then there's no point in us going on with these exercises. "
"Martin: Atta boy "
"Daphne: Hello, Dr. Crane. "
"Niles: Hello, Daphne. "
"Martin: Hey, Niles. "
"Niles: Ah Doing your exercises I see? "
"Daphne: Yes, and if someone doesn't let us get on with them, he's gonna get a little spank on his fanny. "
"Niles: Don't let me.... unless you want to... "
"Martin: What's up? "
"Niles: Well, when I brought you a beer in your room the other day I couldn't help but notice you had pictures of Frasier and Frederick and an autographed one from someone named Ken Griffey Jr., but none of Maris and me. So I brought you this. "
"Martin: Gee, thanks. What's Maris doing wearing jodhpurs? She hasn't taken up horseback riding, has she? "
"Niles: No, no. She wanted to, but unfortunately her little quadriceps are so tight she's incapable of straddling anything larger than a border collie "
"Frasier: I can't believe this I simply can't believe this "
"Martin: What are you bappin' about? "
"Frasier: This, this book It's written by a man I knew. He's taken an incident from my own life, something I shared with him in confidence one night; he's turned it into this trash "
"Daphne: 'Slow Tango'? Well, I just started reading that. You mean to tell me that young man is based on you, Dr. Crane? "
"Frasier: Yes, he is. But did Thomas Jay Fallow have the grace to thank me? No My name isn't even listed in his acknowledgements. "
"Martin: What's it about anyway? "
"Frasier: That is not important. "
"Daphne: It's about his first time. "
"Frasier: Thank you, Daphne. "
"Niles: Your first time doing what? "
"Frasier: Changing a flat tire "
"Niles: Oh "
"Martin: So this whole book is about the night you conceived Frederick. "
"Frasier: Very funny, dad. I’ll have you know that wasn't my first time. "
"Martin: Hey, I’m happy to know it wasn't your only time "
"Niles: Just who was this charitable lass? "
"Frasier: That is not important "
"Daphne: His piano teacher. "
"Martin: His piano teacher? "
"Frasier: Thank you again, Daphne "
"Daphne: It's not like it's a secret, it's all right there in black and white. About your awkward teenage lunging and how you used to call your chest hair your 'Rug of Love.' "
"Frasier: Well, not all of it's true. He did take some literary license. "
"Daphne: Oh, then you're not really able to “bring a woman to hidden realms of ecstasy with your panther-like prowess?” "
"Frasier: Well, that part he got right "
"Martin: Boy, this really fries me. You know, that woman taking advantage of our kid. Not to mention I was putting out ten bucks a week for piano lessons so you could get your hedge trimmed "
"Niles: Wait a minute We're not talking about Miss Warner? "
"Martin: Don't tell me this was going on in your lessons too? "
"Niles: No, you'll be relieved to know that while Frasier was getting his Rachmaninoffs I was actually studying music. "
"Frasier: Now look This was not some tired older woman lusting after young flesh. Clarice and I cared for each other. She showed me a world I'd never known, and... wouldn't know again for six and a half years. "
"Daphne: It's true. As Mr. Fallow put it, 'she saw his sensitive, poetic side and you couldn't help noticing the way her ripe, heaving bosom would brush your cheek when she reached for the metronome.' "
"Frasier: I can't believe a man who drank so heavily remembered so much "
"Niles: And yet he so conveniently forgot who told him the story. "
"Frasier: Yes, well he's going to get a little reminder today "
"TO: "
"Thomas: 'I budded when you kissed me, I withered when you left me, I bloomed a few months while you loved me.' "
"corridor: "
"Roz: Will you calm down? "
"Frasier: Not until I have exacted my pound of flesh. "
"Roz: Could you at least wait until I get my book signed? "
"Frasier: Here, let me sign it for you. "
"Roz: Stop it "
"Frasier: Roz, Roz, you haven't told anyone about this, have you? They'll have a field day with me. "
"Roz: Frasier, give me credit for a little discretion, would you? "
"Bulldog: Hey, Piano Boy Way to pound those ivories "
"Frasier: Bulldog, Bulldog. Listen, it is imperative that this is not commonly known. "
"Bulldog: Hey doc, it's no big deal. "
"Bulldog: Anything for you? I've still got some feeling on the other side of my head. I had a similar experience when I was sixteen, with an older woman who introduced me to the mysteries of love. Of course, she was a hooker. Hey, it was a birthday present from my dad, okay? You wanna know the ironic thing, doc? All I wanted was a bike "
"Roz: Oh come on Frasier, how did you expect me not to tell anybody? You can't keep something like that all bottled up I only told one person. "
"Gil: Hello Frasier, Roz. "
"Frasier: Hi, Gil. "
"Gil: I was just finishing my restaurant review for my show this afternoon when I came across a perfect sandwich named after you, at Rosenthal's Deli. 'Frasier Crane's Double Decker.' It consisted of aged pheasant, spring chicken and of course, plenty of tongue. "
"Bulldog: 'I wept as our bodies made the music of love.' "
"Gil: 'I'm your rhapsody, play me' "
"Bulldog: 'Crescendo, my young maestro, crescendo' "
"Gil: My vessel yearns to dock in the magnificence of your harbor. "
"Bulldog: Hey, that's not in the book "
"Amber: There's one thing I must ask you. What was your inspiration for this poignant love story? "
"corridor: "
"Frasier: Quiet, quiet, it's his last chance. "
"booth: "
"Thomas: Well, Amber, it was given to me... by God. "
"corridor: "
"Frasier: By God? Do you believe this guy's grandiosity? I'm God and he knows it "
"booth: "
"Amber: Well, we'll be right back with the divinely-inspired Thomas Jay Fallow right after this station break. [presses button then gets "
"up:] Will you excuse me, I want to call my husband and see if he can take a long lunch. "
"Frasier: Thomas Jay Fallow "
"Thomas: Frasier Frasier Crane, I can't believe it "
"Frasier: Well, I see my name hasn't entirely escaped your sieve-like memory. "
"Thomas: My what? "
"Frasier: Well, it didn't make it into your list of acknowledgements, you, you... egomaniacal thief "
"Thomas: You read my book. "
"Frasier: I didn't have to read it I lived it Not that anybody would know that from reading your three pages of acknowledgements, in which you mention everyone from your kindergarten teacher to the man who designed the typeface. But no mention of me? No, I'm only the man who gave you the story which you have ruthlessly merchandised into this million-dollar treacle machine I'm finished now. "
"Thomas: I'm so sorry. I don't know how I could have been so thoughtless. "
"Thomas: I owe you everything "
"Roz: Oh my God, Frasier what have you done now? "
"Amber: What happened? "
"Roz: Frasier made him cry "
"Niles: Maris is reading 'Slow Tango In South Seattle.” I think it's put thoughts in her head. This morning I found her cooing over the college student who skims the koi pond. "
"Martin: I wouldn't concern myself. "
"Niles: Do you think it's just innocent flirting? "
"Martin: No, I just wouldn't concern myself. "
"Niles: Frasier, congratulations. Maris was listening to 'Book Chat' during her seaweed wrap and heard Thomas Jay Fallow acknowledge his enormous debt to you. "
"Frasier: Yes, I had a little chat with him this afternoon. "
"Niles: Did he seem properly contrite? "
"Frasier: I made him cry. "
"Martin: That's my boy I guess you're feeling pretty good, eh? "
"Frasier: Well, actually dad the entire incident has left me strangely unsatisfied. I don't know, I still feel sort of empty. It's been churning around in my mind all day. "
"Martin: You kill me, you know. You've got exactly what you wanted and you're still not happy. Frasier, life is not hard, you make it hard. You don't just let things happen and enjoy it. You've got to analyze everything that you can. You know, you can learn a big lesson from this dog here. "
"Martin: You know what makes him happy? A sock Come on, Eddie. "
"Niles: Ignore him. Obviously what's troubling you goes deeper than your usual malaise. "
"Daphne: Shame on you "
"Frasier: What for? "
"Daphne: What for? You just ran out on her. 'Leaving her bed as empty as a swallows nest after fall's first frost.' And you ask me what for? "
"Frasier: I'd just been accepted to Harvard. What else was I gonna do? "
"Daphne: Oh, so you just leave in the middle of the night without so much as a kiss on the forehead. "
"Niles: You never said goodbye to Miss Warner? "
"Frasier: Well, she was sleeping so peacefully. She had an early lesson I left a rose on her pillow. "
"Niles: A-ha "
"Frasier: ”A-ha,” what? "
"Niles: ”A-ha” this, I have a theory. "
"Frasier: Well, why else would you say “a-ha”? "
"Niles: No, no, no. Just listen. You thought you were angry at Thomas Fallow for failing to thank you for the contribution you made to his life. But perhaps the person you're really angry at is yourself. You never thanked Miss Warner for the contribution she made to your life. "
"Frasier: I was only seventeen years old, I'm sure she understood. "
"Niles: Perhaps she didn't. She was a vulnerable, lonely, middle-aged woman. It is possible that her feelings for you ran deeper than you realized? Feelings which you crushed when you disappeared without so much as a thank you or a goodbye. "
"Frasier: Yes well, thank you and goodbye "
"Niles: Fine, I'll just leave you with this "
"thought: your encounter with Thomas Jay Fallow was unsatisfactory because it failed to provide you with the closure you were seeking. For that you will have to make amends with Miss Warner - A-ha "
"Frasier: Very funny, dad "
"TO: "
"Frasier: 'He had been a teenage Balboa, an explorer of the rising pinnacles and gently curving slopes of my body. Then in one explosive burst of discovery he had staked claim to the Pacific ocean that was my soul. But now he was leaving, going, vanishing like a solitary boat on a lonely horizon. Departing like a train, rolling ceaselessly through the night. Exiting swiftly like...' "
"reads: "
"Frasier: 'And so he was gone.' "
"reading: "
"Frasier: 'And now in the cool of the evening I play my piano. And his last words resonate through the "
"notes: ‘I'll come back to you, my cherished one.’ But he never did and all that remains of him are the withered petals of the rose he left upon my pillow.” "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Clarice? Time, the sole thief of youth. "
"Warner: Hello. May I help you? "
"Frasier: Miss Warner? "
"Warner: Yes? "
"Frasier: I'm Frasier Crane. "
"Warner: I'm sorry, my memory's not what it used to be. But please come in. Would you like to sit down? "
"Frasier: Yes, I would. "
"Warner: So, we know each other? "
"Frasier: Well... we were friends. More than friends, actually. You really don't remember? "
"Warner: I'm trying "
"Frasier: You must have some recollection. A fair-haired boy outside your door, at the piano... on the piano... "
"Warner: No, I'm sorry. "
"Frasier: Well, listen, before the memories come flooding back to you. I should tell you that we had a romance that didn't have the happiest of endings. "
"Warner: Oh "
"Frasier: That's why I’m here. You see, our last evening together we “walked through a summer storm and I kissed the raindrops on your nose and promised we'd always be together.” And I broke that promise. You helped a shy adolescent take his first uncertain steps towards becoming a man and how did I repay that kindness? By running off and leaving you with nothing but your memories. "
"Warner: And not many of those either "
"Frasier: Well, can you ever forgive me? "
"Warner: Oh, you're so sweet. Of course I can forgive you. "
"Frasier: Thank you, thank you. "
"Frasier: It's such a relief to get that off my chest. "
"Clarice: Mother, mother, I'm going now. "
"Warner: You run along, Clarice. "
"Frasier: Clarice? "
"Clarice: Oh, excuse me. "
"Warner: Dear, this is Frasier Crane. Apparently we were quite an item once. "
"Clarice: Frasier Crane. Well, what are you doing here? "
"Frasier: Obviously making an enormous mistake. "
"Clarice: Mother, would you get us some iced tea, please? "
"Warner: She's getting rid of me, but I'll be back "
"Clarice: My God, well I can't believe you're here. It's got to be twenty... "
"Frasier: Twenty-five. "
"Clarice: Twenty-five years? Ah, and look at you. "
"Frasier: Look at you, you look incredible. "
"Clarice: Well sure, compared to my mother "
"Frasier: That's not what I mean, you look stunning. "
"Clarice: Thank you. Look at you. You've become a very handsome man. And successful, too. "
"Frasier: Thank you. "
"Clarice: You're here because of that book, aren't you? "
"Frasier: Yes and I'd like to apologise right off. Er, I told that story to Mr. Fallow in confidence. It was never meant to be in print. "
"Clarice: There's no need to apologise. That was a lovely time in my life. It was nice to re-live it. So, are you married? "
"Frasier: Divorced. You? "
"Clarice: I've never married. "
"Frasier: I came here to apologise about more than just the book. I never felt quite right about the way I left things. I abandoned you, it was selfish and cowardly. "
"Clarice: Oh Frasier, relax. I always felt guilty for short-changing you on your music lessons. Do you still keep it up? "
"Frasier: Oh, the piano Yes Gee, I was a little nervous about coming here but now it feels like old times. Sit at middle C. [he sits at the piano] "
"Clarice: Then the metronome. "
"Frasier: Maybe I should get going. Clarice, at the risk of sounding a little forward - would you like to have a cup of coffee with me? "
"Clarice: Thanks, but I'll have to say no. "
"Frasier: If you're worried about the age difference, don't worry. That's no longer an issue. "
"Man:Hi honey, are you ready to go? "
"Clarice: I'll be right out. "
"Frasier: Are you and he... "
"Clarice: Uh-huh. I weren't interested in forty-year-old men then and I guess I'm still not. Great to see you again, though. Bye, mom "
"Warner: Good, now we're alone. See what I did? I put a raindrop on my nose "

" "
"Martin: What the hell are you doing? "
"Daphne: Ironing your son's socks. "
"Martin: Why don't you just twist them into little balls like you do mine? "
"Daphne: He says it bruises the cashmere. He likes them pressed, folded, then neatly arranged in those sock dividers. I saw them in a catalogue once, but couldn't imagine who in the world would ever buy such silly things. Course, I hadn't met Dr. Crane yet. "
"Martin: I used to think there was some sort of mix-up at the hospital. Of course, when Niles came along it shot that theory all to hell. "
"Frasier: Oh, Dad, Dad, please. Coaster. [puts one under the beer] Your beer is sweating. "
"Martin: So am I. You wanna shove one of those under my can? "
"Daphne: If he could, he would. "
"Frasier: Oh, Mrs. Greenway What a pleasant surprise. "
"Dorathea: I knew it That's him "
"Frasier: Won't you come in? "
"Dorathea: I had to see him again before I was sure, but now I'm positive. That is the horny little mixed-breed who got my Phoebe pregnant. "
"Martin: Hey, you can't just bust in here accusing my dog "
"Dorathea: Oh, it's him all right I had to keep shooing him away from Phoebe down at the park. Look at him, he doesn't care who's life he's ruined. All he cares about is his own selfish pleasure "
"Martin: You know what your problem is, Dorthea? You got a bad attitude. "
"Dorathea: Oh "
"Martin: That's why nobody sits with you in the park. "
"Frasier: Mrs. Greenway, there's no way Eddie could be the father, he's been neutered. "
"Dorathea: Oh, really? Then how do you explain these? "
"Frasier: Oh, my God They're miniature Eddies "
"Daphne: Oh, aren't they adorable? Oh "
"Dorathea: Well, I'm glad you think so, because they're yours "
"Frasier: Oh Bad dog Look what you did "
"Frasier: Here, take these. Dad, Dad, I expect an explanation. All this time I thought Eddie had been fixed. "
"Martin: All you had to do was look. "
"Frasier: Well, I am glad to say I've never been that bored. "
"Daphne: Ooh, couldn't you just eat them up? "
"Frasier: Oh, for God's sake, please, don't love them. They'll think they're staying. Keep them off the couch. What were you thinking, letting him run free in the park? Haven't you ever seen the way he tries to romance my towel warmer? "
"Martin: Look, he's cooped up here all day. When we go to the park, I let him off the leash so he can get a little exercise. "
"Frasier: Apparently, that's not all he got. "
"Daphne: I think I found the perfect name for this one... "
"Frasier: STOP Dogs only need names if you are planning to call them to you, which we are not. [grabs a puppy that got loose] Oh, now listen you, you get right back in there, you mangy little thing. Oh, my God... all right, all right, now I've got to run down to the radio station, but believe me we are going to be having a discussion about this when I get... "
"Martin: Oh, relax, Frasier. I'll have Eddie taken care of tomorrow. "
"Frasier: Yes, well you better. Now, Daphne, give me that box, please. "
"Daphne: Where are you taking the puppies? "
"Frasier: To see if I can unload some of them down at the station. "
"Daphne: Oh, well, couldn't we just keep them for a while? "
"Frasier: No, no, we don't want them taking after their father. "
"Frasier: Though it may be too late already. Oh, for God's sake, STOP STARING AT ME "
"Frasier: Hello, Roz, don't you look lovely... "
"Roz: I know what's in the box, and I don't want one. "
"Frasier: But I didn't say anything "
"Roz: Betty from Accounting called to warn me. Where did you find them, anyway? "
"Frasier: In my living room. These are Eddie's mongrel seed. You don't know anybody that wants six puppies, do you? "
"Roz: Six? All right, Eddie "
"Frasier: Oh, please I've been traipsing up and down the hallway for an hour, trying to unload them; I haven't had the slightest bit of luck. "
"Roz: Well, you see Frasier, not everybody likes dogs. Take me, I'm a cat person. I mean it's not like I'd ever buy a cat mug or a cat calendar, or anything, but; I had a cat when I was growing up. We were almost inseparable. Muffles... or Scruffles, something like that. "
"Frasier: You know, Roz, it's entirely possible that there's a dog lover inside of you that's just dying to get out. Don't you think so? "
"Frasier: Come on, come on, just, just take a look, just have a look, let's have a look... "
"Roz: Ooh, he's adorable Oh, come here little fella. Oh, aren't you the cutest little thing? Oh, oh, oh, yeah, give me a little kiss. Ooh, I love you too [Then hands the puppy back with a completely flat face; deadpan] There, happy now? "
"Frasier: Roz How can you just toss him aside after such a tender display of affection? "
"Roz: I can do it with men, too. Come on, Frasier, it's time to start the show. "
"Frasier: Oh, Phil, puppy, puppy [Phil wards him off with his hands and keeps walking] They're all on to me. All right, now, you guys behave yourselves. "
"Frasier: Hello, Seattle, this is Dr. Frasier Crane coming to you from KACL 780 talk radio. I'll be with you for the next three hours. So Roz, who's our first caller? "
"Roz: We have Rita on line four, she's feeling a little overwhelmed at home. "
"Frasier: Hello, Rita, I'm listening. "
"Rita: Yeah, Dr. Crane? Dr. Crane... I'm, I'm- uh, thank you for taking my call. I, I, I tell you, I am about to lose my mind. I am raising four kids by myself, the oldest one is not even seven and the other three are all under five. Between cooking and cleaning and changing diapers and tripping over toys... I, I feel sometimes like I’m about to snap. What should I do? "
"Frasier: Have you considered getting a puppy? "
"Thomas: Well, if we can't have this one, are there any other puppies available? "
"Daphne: No, we found homes for all the others. But thanks for coming over, 'bye now. "
"Thomas: But, the children. Dr. Crane said... "
"Daphne: Oh, don't get all wobbly now. There are other dogs in the world, you know. Now give me that. [takes the dog from the little girl and ushers them out the door] Thank you for coming over, thank you. "
"Frasier: I thought you might like some wine and paté, and I made some lemonade for the children... "
"Frasier: Where are the Thomases? Why is that dog still here? "
"Daphne: I'm sorry, Dr. Crane, but they struck me as unfit guardians. "
"Frasier: For God's sake, he works at the zoo She's a nurse, Billy's an altar boy and Kathy is a Camp-Fire Girl "
"Daphne: They had a dark aura. "
"Frasier: They had a ten-acre farm If they'd have taken me, I'd have gone with them "
"Daphne: Oh, I see So you want me to give the little fellow away to just anybody. "
"Frasier: Well, no, I'm not saying that. It's just that he can't stay here. "
"Frasier: Oh, hello, Niles. Come on in. "
"Niles: Hope you don't mind my stopping by, but Maris is hosting the Women's League Senior yoga group and... old money in body stockings... "
"Frasier: Say no more, you're welcome to hide out here. "
"Niles: I see the kennel is still open. "
"Frasier: Yes, but that's the last one. I'd even managed to find a nice home for him, but Daphne thought the family wasn't nice enough. Some paté, Niles? "
"Daphne: I didn't reject them, the dog did. Canines have a very keen sense of who's a nice person and who isn't. Why, many's the time I've chosen a man based solely on the way my mum's springer spaniel took to them. "
"Frasier: Oh, Daphne, that is preposterous Letting a dog choose your dates? "
"Daphne: It's true If a dog likes a man, it's a good bet he's warm and sensitive. "
"Niles: You know, I really didn't get a good look at this little tyke. Come here, boy, come to your Uncle Niles. "
"Daphne: Look at that He's taken quite a shine to you. "
"Niles: Yes, happens all the time. "
"Frasier: Daphne, would you mind taking the dog away, please? Get back on the phone with the Thomases, tell them we've reconsidered. "
"Daphne: All right. But only for a two-week trial. "
"Frasier: Thank you. "
"Daphne: Come along, Basil. "
"Frasier: I told you not to name them "
"Niles: Ooh, hello, Dad. "
"Martin: Afternoon, boys. "
"Frasier: Dad, I seem to remember that Eddie had a little appointment down at the vet's. Can't help but notice he still has that certain spring in his step. "
"Martin: Yeah, well, we started heading down there, but the traffic was a bear, you know. You get a sunny day in this town and everybody forgets how to drive. "
"Frasier: You are going to reschedule, aren't you? "
"Martin: Oh, yeah, yeah, I'll call in the morning. "
"Frasier: That's the second time you've canceled that appointment. What seems to be the problem? "
"Martin: Oh, it's no problem. What's the big deal? I'll call tomorrow. Relax, will ya? "
"Niles: Oh, dear God, he's licking me "
"Frasier: Eddie, just stop [He shoos Eddie away, then grabs Niles's head for a closer look.] Oh, Niles, you have liver behind your ears. "
"Niles: I imagine I must have picked up a cracker and inadvertently scratched behind my ear. "
"Frasier: So you're telling me that you had a wad of cold meat behind your ears and didn't feel it? "
"Niles: That's the story I'm sticking with, yes. "
"Frasier: Dad, Dad, "
"listen: I want your assurance that you'll take care of this. "
"Martin: Fine. "
"Frasier: You promise? "
"Martin: Hey I said I'd do it and I will. You don't have to pin a note to my sweater, get off my back Anybody wants me, I'll be down at Duke's. "
"Niles: Ever notice how much faster he moves when he's wrong? "
"Frasier: Apparently he's got some sort of psychological block against taking Eddie down there. Guess I'm gonna have to do it. Somebody has to be responsible in this family. OK, come on, Eddie let's go. Good boy. [Eddie runs over to the kitchen table.] Eddie? Uh, Niles... [He motions for Niles to help him.] "
"Niles: Now Eddie, it's a routine operation. They say it's almost painless, although I can't imagine... "
"Frasier: You know, Niles, perhaps it's best we don't discuss the operation. We might spook him "
"Niles: Excuse me? Are you saying he understands me? "
"Frasier: Well, he understands the word B - A - T - H. God knows how much english he's picked up. "
"Niles: Fine. Tu tournes a droit. "
"Frasier: Ah, bon, bon. Je marcherai derriere lui.. "
"Niles: Mais, tu es celui qui va l'amener chez le medecin pour le... snip-snip. "
"Frasier: Ah. C'es vrais, mais...oh, what are we doing? Eddie, come here This is ridiculous. Look at him. Oh, for Pete's sake. NO "
"Frasier: What are you staring at? You know why you're here, don't you? Well now, listen, it's for your own good. Believe me you'll be much happier afterwards. Look, your day-to-day routine, it'll be exactly the same. You'll be able to sleep, run around with your little buddies, go play in the woods, chase the birds, lick your... did I mention sleep? "
"Martin: You've got a lot of nerve, you know that? You all right, boy? "
"Frasier: Well, of course he's all right, Dad. Why are you getting so upset? I'm only doing this to help you out. "
"Martin: Oh, that's a load of crap. "
"Frasier: Look, we agreed that this had to be done, right? Now, you seem to be have a problem with it, so I took charge. "
"Martin: Well, I don't need you taking charge. Eddie's my dog, so mind your own damn business. And here's something else you should "
"know: I don't need your help and I don't want it "
"Frasier: Why are you so upset? It doesn't matter who brought him down here. "
"Martin: Yes it does I'm perfectly capable of taking care of him. Just like I feed him, walk him and give him his bath "
"Martin: Eddie See what you did "
"Frasier: Me? "
"Martin: OK. Thanks, and oh, Daphne's here in case anybody sees him. I got the guys at the station circulating Eddie's picture. I'm gonna go out and look for him so more. "
"Daphne: Oh, come on, now. You've done enough. Why don't you just sit still and drink your tea? "
"Martin: I hate tea "
"Daphne: Humor me. In an emergency, it's all I know how to do. "
"Martin: That's a real comfort coming from a health care provider. "
"Frasier: Dad, I'm sorry. There was no luck at the pound. They said they'd call if they find a dog matching Eddie's description. A five hundred dollar reward for Eddie? "
"Frasier: Are you sure it's enough? "
"Martin: Right now it's about five hundred more than I'd pay to get you back. "
"Frasier: Look, Dad, I said I was sorry. "
"Martin: Well, I just can't sit here. I'm goin' back to the park. "
"Frasier: The park again? What makes you think he's gonna show up there? "
"Martin: Because that's his hangout. Didn't you ever have a place like that? A place where you went to meet women, a place where you got lucky? "
"Frasier: Well, I suppose so, yeah. "
"Martin: Didn't you go back? "
"Frasier: To the park "
"Martin: This time we'll comb every inch of that place. Every tree, every bush... uh, Daphne, we're gonna need more help, so call Niles and tell him we'll pick him up. "
"Frasier: Oh, yes, wouldn't want to go out in the wilds without one of the world’s great outdoorsmen "
"Daphne: Oh, this is odd. I just got one of my psychic flashes. It's about Eddie. "
"Martin: Well? "
"Daphne: It doesn't make any sense. All I'm getting is a picture of Eddie sitting with Dr. Crane. "
"Martin: Any luck? "
"Frasier: I couldn't find him. "
"Martin: Where's Niles? "
"Frasier: Ah, we split up to cover more ground. "
"Martin: Well, scrunch down. If Eddie comes back and sees you here, he'll run away again. "
"Frasier: You know, Dad, maybe we oughta call it a night. You've been sittin' in this car for three hours. "
"Martin: Ah, that's nothin'. I was on a stakeout once for fifteen hours without ever gettin' out of the car. We had a contest to see who could last the longest. The winner was 'Canteen' McHugh. Know why we called him that? "
"Frasier: I think I can guess. "
"Martin: Because his bladder was the size of a canteen. "
"Frasier: Thank you for clearing that up. "
"Martin: You could've slung his bladder over your shoulder and gone on a twenty mile forced march through the desert. "
"Frasier: Big, huh? "
"Martin: Isn't that what I've been sayin'? "
"Martin: Hey, close that window It's freezin' "
"Frasier: Oh, Dad, it's like a blast furnace in here. "
"Martin: Well, I'm cold, okay? At my age, you get cold easily. "
"Frasier: All right. "
"Frasier: You know Dad, I've just developed a very intersting theory about you... "
"Martin: If I begged you, would you share it with me? "
"Frasier: If that's your attitude, just forget it "
"Frasier: Hello? Oh, Niles "
"Martin: Did he find him? "
"Frasier: Just a second, Niles, let me put you on speaker-phone here. Hang on. OK, go ahead, Niles. "
"Niles: I'm out here in the middle of the park and I'm lost Thank God for my cellular "
"Martin: Did you see Eddie? "
"Niles: No, but I thought I saw a raccoon. When I stopped running, I had no idea where I was. You've got to help me "
"Frasier: All right, all right, Niles, just, just remain calm. Let me think back to my Boy Scout training. All right, now, we're on the northeast corner of the park... all right, look into the heavens and see if you can spot the North Star. Then you want to turn twelve degrees to your right... "
"Martin: Oh, for God's sake, just walk towards the horn. [begins honking] "
"Niles: I hear it I hear it, Dad I'm walking. "
"Martin: All right, just keep following it. "
"Niles: I see a grove of trees, and a fountain, and... a horrible, wretched, hunchbacked old man Stay away from me No, no, it was just a bush. OK, OK, things are beginning to look familiar now. Keep honking. I think I'm homing in. Yes, I'm quite sure this is the way. "
"Niles: OK, you can hang up now. That was a harrowing experience "
"Martin: Yeah, a shrub and a raccoon in one night and you lived to tell about it. "
"Niles: Dad, I'm sorry I couldn't find Eddie. I hope you'll understand, I think I'd like to go home now and hold my wife. That is, if she'll let me. I'll just hail a cab. "
"Frasier: Be sure to call us from the curb when you get there, so we know you're safe. "
"Martin: Hey, you're probably tired too. If you want to go with him, that's OK. "
"Frasier: No, that's all right, Dad. I'll stay for a little while longer. "
"Martin: Look, I'm sorry I cut you off like that before, I've just never gone in for that psychological mumbo-jumbo. Probably started back on the force when they'd make us go see The Squirrel. "
"Frasier: Who? "
"Martin: Dr. Bergman, the department shrink. We called him 'The Squirrel' 'cause guys got sent to him when they got squirrelly. He'd show you a bunch of ink-blots and ask about your toilet habits... If I wanted to talk about toilet habits, I woulda stayed partners with Nate Dombrowski. We nicknamed him 'The Big...' "
"Frasier: Thank you "
"Martin: Look, it wasn't just Eddie I was mad about. Eddie was the straw that broke the camel's back. Seems like I'm always being told to take my feet off the furniture, put a coaster under my beer, turn the TV down... I used to make the rules, and now I have to follow them. This makin' any sense to you? "
"Frasier: From a psychological standpoint, it makes perfect sense. Slowly, over the years, your responsibilities have been taken away from you, and you, well, you feel symbolically castrated. "
"Martin: Oh, why does everything with you shrinks start in the crotch? "
"Frasier: All right, all right. Well, maybe my rules are too rigid. Maybe I should try to relax a little. "
"Martin: No, no. Hey, it's your house, you do what you want. I don't know what's buggin' me. I guess it's not easy for a guy like me to not be in charge. "
"Frasier: You know, Dad, a lot of people confuse not being in charge with not being respected. I hope you're not making that mistake, because you command a great deal of respect. There's not a day in my life when I don't hold myself up to the Martin Crane yardstick. I guess a son always wants to make his father proud. "
"Martin: Yeah, I guess. "
"Frasier: So...? "
"Martin: Yeah, yeah, you're doin' fine. Even if you are a big pain in the ass. "
"Frasier: You know, I'm not sure I could have made Eddie go through with that operation, anyway. That's a tough thing for a guy to do to another guy. "
"Martin: Amen to that. "
"Frasier: You know what? It's getting kinda late. What do you say we go home and get some sleep? "
"Martin: Eddie Hey, hey, come here boy [Eddie jumps in and sits on his lap.] Hey, atta boy Hey, good to see you fella, how ya doin'? It might be nice if you welcomed him back. "
"Frasier: Hello, Eddie. Good dog - oh, wet dog "
"Martin: Yeah, you're shivering [grabs some clothing from the back seat and wraps it around Eddie] Here, we gotta get you warmed up "
"Frasier: Dad That's a hundred percent cashmere pull-over [Martin glares at him] It's meant to be worn with the collar up. "

"Frasier: Oh my God Fire "
"Martin: Eddie Eddie Where are you, boy? "
"Frasier: Dad, wake up Dad, are you in there? "
"Martin: Eddie Here, Eddie Come on "
"Frasier: Dad, where are you? Where’s the fire? "
"Martin: Have you seen Eddie? "
"Frasier: What's burning? Where's the fire? "
"Martin: Eddie "
"Daphne: It's alright, it's alright False alarm The one above my bed went off. "
"Frasier: Thank God "
"Daphne: Oh, and don't worry about Eddie - he's back in my room. God, the noise the bloody thing makes It would be less upsetting just to wake up on fire "
"Martin: What the hell triggered it? "
"Daphne: Who knows? I was dozing quite peacefully when it started screaming away for no reason at all. "
"Frasier: I see. What have we here? Eddie, you've been smoking in Daphne's bedroom, bad dog "
"Daphne: I know, you have a no-smoking rule. I'm sorry. But every now and again I feel a bit tense and I find a ciggy can be very soothing. "
"Martin: Oh yeah, it's real soothing. It only should be an hour before my heart stops fibrillating. "
"Frasier: Oh, it figures, 3 AM. Of course this would happen the night before I have an early morning meeting "
"Frasier: Daphne, aren't you going back to bed? "
"Daphne: No. I'll just sit up for a bit, I'm feeling a bit blue. "
"Frasier: Anything you'd like to talk about? "
"Daphne: No, you need your sleep, it's nothing important. [he starts to exit] Just this feeling that my life's a gaping sinkhole and I'm just marking time while the flower of my youth rots on the vine. "
"Frasier: Well, so long as you’re sure. "
"Frasier: I really wish you'd tell me about it. "
"Daphne: Well, if you must know, it's my love life. "
"Frasier: Really? You've been seeing a man? "
"Daphne: Only when I close my eyes and concentrate. "
"Frasier: Ah, I see. You're going through a bit of a drought, eh? "
"Daphne: No wonder. The rare times I do go out, it's usually with your father. People see us and assume I'm his daughter, or else his girlfriend. Either way, it's like having my own personal can of stud repellant. "
"Frasier: Yes well, I know how bleak these times can be. But believe me, they will come to an end sooner or later. I remember a time back in Boston when I was going through exactly what you're going through now. Just a week later I met a lovely barmaid – sophisticated, if a bit loquacious. We fell madly in love, we got engaged... Of course, she left me standing at the altar. But the point is, I didn't give up. I took my poor, battered heart and offered it to Lilith... Who put it in her little Cuisinart and hit the purée button But, I rebounded And look how far I've come... I'm divorced, lonely, and living with my father. "
"Roz: I figured I'd find you here You know, you missed your meeting with the new station manager. "
"Frasier: Oh no, I completely forgot. "
"Roz: God, you look like you've been ridden hard and put away wet. "
"Frasier: I was up till all hours of the night with Daphne, competing to see which one of us had the most pathetic love life. On the bright side, I won. "
"Roz: Well, I know what your problems are. What are Daphne's? "
"Frasier: She's just having trouble finding men. "
"Roz: Say no more "
"Frasier: No, Roz, Roz, it's really not necessary. You do not have to donate one of your boyfriends to Daphne. "
"Roz: Oh, come on, I'd be happy to. "
"Frasier: But still, one hates to break up a collection. "
"Niles: There we go - double espresso, and my mocha latte. Do those chocolate shavings look any different to you? "
"Frasier: No. "
"Niles: Well, they do to me. I think they've switched to an inferior domestic brand. [takes a sip and swishes them around like wine] Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm - waxy. "
"Roz: Oh, here we go Sven Bachman, he's an aerobics instructor. "
"Frasier: I don't think so. "
"Roz: Oh, this one's perfect Gunther Dietrich. He's loads of fun, and he's a runway model. "
"Frasier: A German narcissist; now there's an appealing combination. "
"Roz: Okay, okay, I'll keep looking. "
"Niles: Looking for what? "
"Roz: I'm helping Frasier find a man for Daphne. "
"Niles: What? "
"Roz: Here we go He's a tennis instructor, and his name is Brick. "
"Niles: Dear God, Frasier - Sven, Gunther, Brick? Why not just lather Daphne up with baby oil and hurl her over the wall of a prison yard? "
"Roz: Excuse me, but I've dated all these guys. "
"Niles: Well, where do you think I came up with the imagery? "
"Roz: Listen, you little titmouse- "
"Frasier: Alright "
"Niles: you are completely out of line here. And "
"Roz: he does have a point. You and Daphne are entirely different kinds of women. Whilst Daphne is very shy and inexperienced, you are more... well, a lot more... well, actually it's hard to find anyone who's more... "
"Roz: Oh, I get it Not one man I've ever dated is good enough for Miss Daphne, is that what you're trying to say? "
"Frasier: No, it's what I'm trying not to say, and you're not making it very easy. "
"Roz: Oh, I’m out of here. "
"Frasier: Oh, Roz, please wait. "
"Roz: Oh no, I can't stay, the fleet's in "
"TO: "
"Frasier: And this concludes our test of the emergency broadcast system. Had this been a real emergency, your radio would be melting in your hands. We'll be right back after these messages. "
"Roz: In the future, please keep your disgusting half-eaten food off my console. In fact, just stay out of my sight "
"Frasier: You're still mad at me, I can tell. "
"Roz: And there's that keen sensitivity that keeps you in such demand with the ladies. "
"Frasier: Look Roz, I'm sorry if I insulted you earlier. But the truth is, I feel very protective of Daphne. See, the kind of man I'm looking for has to be good-looking, smart, successful... "
"Tom: Excuse me. "
"Frasier: Yes? "
"Tom: I'm Tom Duran, the new station manager. "
"Frasier: Oh Tom, hey, it's a pleasure to meet you. I'm so sorry about missing the meeting this morning, I slept right through it. "
"Tom: Oh yeah me too, and I was there. "
"Tom: Say, that's a beautiful tie. "
"Frasier: Oh, thank you. Yes, I got this one in London at one of those custom shops just of off Sloane Square. "
"Tom: You know, I just came from London. I spent the last five years working for the BBC. "
"Frasier: Really? I love London - the museums, the theatre... "
"Tom: Oh yeah, I'm a big theatre buff, three shows a week. I hated leaving. "
"Frasier: I can imagine. Why did you? "
"Tom: Well, I just kind of went through a messy break-up. I thought I'd sleep better with a continent between us. "
"Frasier: Yes, I know the feeling So, I take it then you're unattached? "
"Tom: Yes, but I haven't given up hope. "
"Frasier: Well, you may have come to the right place. "
"Tom: Really? "
"Frasier: Yes. You say you're very fond of the English? "
"Tom: Oh yes, very much. You know, I think I've always had a weakness for people who are just a little eccentric. "
"Frasier: Really? "
"Roz: Fifteen seconds. "
"Tom: Well, it was nice meeting you. "
"Frasier: Likewise. "
"Frasier: Uh, say Tom, this may sound like short notice, but if you're not busy Saturday, why don't you come round my place for dinner? Nothing fancy. "
"Tom: Well thanks, I'd like that. "
"Frasier: Great "
"Frasier: Hello Seattle, we're back. Roz, who do we have up next? "
"Roz: We have James from Tacoma on line one. "
"Frasier: Hello James, I'm listening... "
"Tom: Hi, Roz. "
"Roz: Hi, Tom. How’s it going? "
"Tom: Well, you know, it's the same with every job I take. The word flies like wild fire. "
"Roz: What's that? "
"Tom: Oh, you know, you tell one or two people you're gay and before you can blink it's all over the station. "
"Roz: Well, they don't call it “broadcasting” for nothing. "
"Tom: He seems like a nice guy. "
"Roz: Oh, he's OK. "
"Tom: I hope he's more than OK, he just asked me out on a date. "
"Roz: Frasier just asked you out on a date? "
"Tom: Well, he asked me to his place for dinner. So I wanted to ask you, is there any particular wine he likes? "
"Roz: Listen Tom, there is something I think you need to know about Frasier... "
"Tom: What? "
"card: 'HANDS OFF HE'S TAKEN' "
"Roz: He's nuts about chardonnay. "
"Tom: Thanks "
"TO: "
"Daphne: Does he ask permission first? Oh no, he just barges in and says he's set me up with God-knows-who, and I'm supposed to turn cartwheels like I'm bloody Cinderella. "
"Frasier: Will you please relax? Look, I told you, this is not a set- up. Tom doesn't even know you'll be here. "
"Daphne: Oh, an ambush then. Much nicer My girlfriends in Manchester used to set me up all the time. And it was always some gangly bounder with a boarding-house reach. And he wasn't going for the Coleman's Hot Mustard, if you know what I mean "
"Frasier: Just keep in mind, Tom is just a co-worker who's coming by for a pleasant little dinner. If some sparks should ignite, then fine, but there is no pressure, absolutely no pressure... is that what you're wearing? "
"Daphne: Why, what's wrong with it? "
"Frasier: Don't you have something with a little more oomph? Oh, what About that, that strapless number you have? [motions down his hips] "
"Daphne: Do you have any idea how uncomfortable a strapless bra is? "
"Frasier: Well, thanks to my fraternity days, as a matter of fact I do "
"Frasier: Tom Come on in. "
"Tom: Hi, Frasier. "
"Frasier: Good to see you. "
"Tom: Oh, I don't know, something told me you might like chardonnay. "
"Frasier: Oh my, that's my favorite. So, what do you think of this place? "
"Tom: That’s a hell of a view "
"Frasier: It's even better from the bedroom. "
"Tom: Why don't we just start with the drink? "
"Tom: Oh, four places, who's joining us? "
"Frasier: Oh, just my little "
"household: my father and his charming physical therapist, Daphne. "
"Tom: You live with your dad? I can't even imagine that. Well, I mean it's great that you get along so well, but doesn’t, um... having him here put a crimp in your love life? "
"Frasier: Oh, not at all. Except when I bring my dates home, he tries to steal them. "
"Frasier: He's quite the old rascal "
"Frasier: Well, look who we have here. Tom, I'd like you to meet Daphne. Daphne this is Tom Duran. "
"Tom: Pleasure to meet you. "
"Daphne: Likewise. Oh, Dr. Crane, you didn't take his coat "
"Frasier: Oh, sorry. "
"Daphne: May I? THANK YOU, THANK YOU” YOU LOOK FABULOUS” "
"Daphne: Oh, this is strange, I'm picking up a vibration from your coat. "
"Tom: Excuse me? "
"Frasier: Yes well, Daphne feels she possesses psychic powers - you know those English eccentrics. "
"Daphne: Oh, you've just been through a very painful break-up, haven't you? "
"Tom: Yes Oh, wait a minute, you told her that, didn't you? "
"Frasier: No, no. "
"Daphne: There was a bitter dispute about ownership of opera recordings. "
"Tom: Whoa "
"Daphne: Now, if you’ll excuse me, I'll nip into the kitchen. I have a bird to baste. "
"Frasier: Quite something, isn't she? "
"Tom: Yeah, she's great. I love hearing that accent again. "
"Martin: Hey Frasier, I don't have to put a tie on for this joker, do I? "
"Frasier: Tom, this is my father, Martin Crane. "
"Tom: Tom Duran, nice to meet you. "
"Martin: I'm sorry about that “joker” business. I call everybody joker, jerk, pinhead, bozo... "
"Frasier: And amazingly he's free for dinner on short notice. Why don't I just open some of this wonderful wine? "
"Frasier: Well? "
"Daphne: Oh, he's a looker. I'm glad you made me put on my lucky bra. He's worth every wire digging into my ribcage. "
"Frasier: Yes, you've made quite an impression on him too. He thinks you're great "
"Daphne: Oh, go on God, listen to me getting carried away like a school girl when I've just met the man. No, I'm not raising my hopes tonight - though I'm glad I raised my bosom. "
"Martin: Yeah, let me tell you, you’re gonna love Seattle. It's a real people place. Great food, great bars... "
"Tom: I've heard that. Any you recommend? "
"Martin: Yeah, I usually hang out at a place called Duke’s. Great crowd, lot of young cops. So, do you like football? "
"Tom: Yeah, yeah, I really missed it when I was living in London. "
"Martin: Yeah, well maybe we can take you to see a Seahawks game sometime. Frasier hates it, so it'd just be us. "
"Tom: Hey, Frasier warned me about you "
"Martin: Yeah, I guess I yell at the players too loud. "
"Frasier: Dad, I took the liberty of selecting an amusing little vintage for you too. Sorry, I didn't bring the pull-tab so you could sniff it. "
"Martin: Merci beaucoup. "
"Niles: Hello, Frasier. Oh, thank you. I just stopped by to return your book. "
"Frasier: Oh yes, thank you, well don't let me keep you. "
"Niles: Am I interrupting something? "
"Frasier: As a matter of fact, I'm introducing a man to Daphne. "
"Niles: Ah Guess you don't want me around then. How do you do? I'm Dr. Niles Crane. "
"Tom: Hi, I'm Tom Duran. "
"Daphne: Bird's all done. Now all I need is a pair of big strong arms to haul it out of the oven. "
"Niles: Well, I certainly don't need to be asked twice. "
"Time: 14"
":10) "
"Tom: So, halfway through the interview her stomach starts rumbling. And her body mike's picking it up, but I have to ignore it. Because what am I going to say; 'Would her majesty care for a Tums?' "
"Daphne: I could listen to your stories all night. They're so funny. "
"Niles: And all involving bodily functions. "
"Daphne: Tom, I could use a little hand in the kitchen... "
"Niles: No, no, sit Daphne, after all that cooking you must be... absolutely strapless. "
"Tom: Er, Niles, can I speak with you for a moment? "
"Niles: Yes. "
"Tom: I was wondering, did I do anything that offended you? "
"Niles: No. "
"Tom: Oh. It must be all in my head, but I sensed that you had a problem with me dating Frasier. "
"Niles: Well, if you must know... "
"Niles: I'm sorry, what was the question? "
"Tom: Do you have some problem with me dating your brother? "
"Niles: No. "
"Frasier: Now Niles, I didn't ask Tom to dinner so he could talk with you all night in the kitchen. There are others who would like to have a crack at him "
"Martin: That Tom's a great guy, huh? You think maybe him and Daphne... "
"Tom: You know, I can't remember the last time I had such a wonderful evening. "
"Daphne: Oh no, we should be thanking you. I can't remember when I’ve laughed so hard. "
"Daphne: You’ve still got Mr. Crane going. "
"Frasier: Daphne, I think a little after dinner music would be appropriate. "
"Daphne: Good idea. "
"Frasier: She's, er, quite a woman, isn't she? "
"Tom: Um, Frasier, I was wondering. "
"Frasier: Yes? "
"Tom: Do you think before the evening's over we could get a little one-on-one time? "
"Frasier: Oh, I think I can arrange that. "
"whisper: "
"Frasier: Daphne "
"Daphne: Yes? "
"Frasier: He says he wants to be alone with you "
"Daphne: No "
"Frasier: Yes "
"Daphne: This really is my lucky bra Keep the wine flowing, I'll go fix my lipstick. "
"Frasier: Okay. "
"Martin: Yeah, I guess I'd better be hitting the old sack. Don't want to stand in the way of young romance "
"Frasier: Thanks, dad. "
"Martin: Goodnight, Tom. "
"Tom: Goodnight, Martin. "
"Frasier: And Niles, isn't it time you were running along too? "
"Niles: Yes, I must be on my way. And, Frasier, I must apologise, I was wrong about Tom. If I had to choose a man for Daphne, he's the one I'd pick. "
"Frasier: Good. "
"Niles: Goodnight Tom, nice to meet you. "
"Tom: Goodnight. "
"Niles: Frasier, a word in your ear? "
"Niles: There’s something I have to tell you. Dad wanted to but I won the coin toss. "
"Frasier: Yes, what is it? "
"Niles: Well, I had a little chat with Tom in the kitchen and he told me he's interested in pursing a romantic relationship. But, the object of his affections is not Daphne. "
"Frasier: Damn that Roz "
"Niles: No, no. It's you. "
"Frasier: Me? That's impossible, Tom's not gay "
"Niles: He seems to be under that impression. "
"Frasier: Well, what on earth could have made him think I was interested in him? All I did was ask him if he was attached, and then we talked about the theatre and men's fashions... Oh my God Niles, do you realise what this means? "
"Niles: Yes, you're dating your boss. You of all people should know the pitfalls of an office relationship. "
"Frasier: Yes, but he... he just never mentioned the fact he... "
"Niles: I'll call you tomorrow. But not too early, of course. "
"Tom: So... "
"Frasier: So... God, I hate this song. "
"Tom: You know, I've broken my rule for you. I usually don't date guys I work with. "
"Frasier: Yes, well, I've sort of relaxed my rule for you too. "
"Tom: You're cute when you're nervous. "
"Frasier: I must be downright adorable now then. Listen Tom, I'm sorry, but we seem to have gotten our lines crossed here. The truth is I'm entirely straight. "
"Tom: Hey, if you're not interested just say so. "
"Frasier: Oh no, it's true, I really am. I just invited you to dinner because you seemed so charming and you were so fond of the British, I thought you might be the perfect man for Daphne. "
"hear: "
"Tom: I can't believe this. You really had no idea that I'm gay? "
"Frasier: Don't take this wrong, but it never even occurred to me you might be gay. "
"Tom: Well, it never even occurred to me that you might be straight. "
"Frasier: Thank you. Geez, Tom, I feel just awful. Seems I've just been leading you on all night. "
"Tom: Oh, it's OK. It’s an honest mistake. "
"Frasier: Yes, but I've been pouring you drinks, building up your hopes, making you think you might have found a man sophisticated and sensitive enough to help you... "
"Tom: Frasier, I'll learn to love again. "
"Frasier: Yes, of course. "
"Tom: You'll apologize to Daphne? "
"Frasier: For the rest of my days. "
"Tom: Does this mean your dad's not gay either? "
"Frasier: No, no, dad's not gay. "
"Tom: "
"Frasier: No, I'm afraid not. "
"Tom: Huh... so wait a minute, this Maris guy he kept mentioning is a woman? "
"Frasier: Well, the jury's still out on that one. "

"Maggie: It's not that I don't like him, Dr. "
"Crane: it's just that he's got so attached to me. Roses every day for a week after two dates "
"Frasier: Maggie, the first thing you have to do is sit Gavin down for a nice long conversation. [Frasier notices Roz shaking her head] A frank and honest discussion, tell him that though he wants to go at one speed you need to go at another. [Frasier notices Roz shaking her head again] Tell him you're not rejecting him and that you're fond of him but if he doesn't give you some breathing room... you know, suddenly I wonder what Roz, my non-PhD holding producer thinks you should do? "
"Roz: Well, I just think that any guy that's that clingy after two dates has a major insecurity problem. I say dump him "
"now: head to the hills and don't look back. "
"Maggie: That's what I wanted to do but I felt so guilty. Thanks so much, bye. "
"Frasier: And that takes us to commercial. This, for those of you that may have forgotten, is the 'Dr. Frasier Crane Show' "
"Roz: Here's your new parking pass. I confirmed your dinner reservations for three; at your father's request you'll be dining at 'Chez Shrimp.' "
"Frasier: Oh "
"Roz: There are two letters that you've got to "
"sign: a card for Clarence the guard that we're all signing, and a letter for the sign-ups for the KACL bowling team - I'll file this right in the trash. "
"Frasier: Oh wonderful, another card. Of course, I, as resident wit here, will have to think of something clever to say. Well, at least I've got another gala KACL birthday bash to look forward to. I can just taste that frozen Sara Lee cake right now, whilst, on applause, a full-grown adult snuffs out a handful of tiny candles "
"Roz: What are you grousing about? "
"Frasier: Oh nothing, nothing. "
"Frasier: Yes, the pageantry never stops. "
"Martin: Mr. Fancy-pants You've gotta buy a German car "
"Frasier: It's not my fault it broke down. "
"Martin: Hey, if you bought American, they wouldn't have to tow your car halfway across the state to get it fixed. That's why I always buy American. Breakdown, you can drive to the nearest garage. I could break down all alone in the middle of Alaska... "
"Frasier: Finally a thought to raise all our spirits "
"Niles: This traffic is murder. I'd suggest we walk home but I'm afraid what the humidity will do to these loafers. Does calfskin pucker? "
"Frasier: Yes, Niles That's why on humid farms, the calf is the most made-fun-of of all the animals "
"Niles: There's no point in being snide. We're all going to be in here for a while, we might as well try and make pleasant conversation. We are a family, after all, it shouldn't be that hard. "
"Martin: So, you been driving long? "
"Arleen: Not really. "
"Martin: I bet you have some pretty good stories, though? "
"Arleen: You guys ever hear of a woman having a baby in a cab? "
"Martin: Why, did it happen in this cab? "
"Arleen: No, I think it's about to. "
"Martin: You're pregnant "
"Arleen: Yes. "
"Frasier: Well, don't panic, it may just be false labor. "
"Arleen: My water's just broken I'm sitting in a puddle of water. "
"Niles: Calfskin, calfskin "
"Frasier: Niles "
"Martin: I think the closest hospital is First Methodist. "
"Frasier: Dad, we'll never make it in this traffic. I think we better pull over. "
"Niles: Please try to park facing down hill. "
"Frasier: Niles "
"Arleen: I can't have my baby here "
"Frasier: All right, there's no reason for you to be concerned. You're in the presence of two trained medical professionals. Niles, help the woman. "
"Frasier: No, Niles The other door. "
"Martin: Is anybody there? Come in "
"Niles: All right, the most important thing you can do right now is breath deeply. Just do as I do. "
"Frasier: Are you feeling faint or out of breath? "
"Niles: Yes, both of those. "
"Man: Hello, go ahead. "
"Martin: Yeah, I'm calling from cab number... 804. This is an emergency. Your driver, Arleen, just went into labor. We're at the corner of 14th on Sycamore. We need an ambulance here right now, do you hear me? Over. "
"Man: Yes, I'll get right on it. "
"Arleen: Ah, it really hurts. "
"Niles: It's okay, it's natural. "
"Arleen: No, you're squeezing my hand "
"Frasier: Get a hold of yourself, Niles "
"Niles: I'm sorry, I only did this once before in medical school. And all I remember is a bright light, lots of blood and then a linoleum floor hurtling towards my forehead. "
"Arleen: You fainted "
"Niles: Oh, switch places with me, honey, and see how you do "
"Frasier: Oh, Niles get out of there. I'll help her. "
"Arleen: The baby's coming now "
"Frasier: If it does come, I'll be here to catch it. Now listen, just continue with your breathing. Now, I don't want you feeling guilty for having your baby in a cab. No, there's nothing to be ashamed of. I'm sure many great Americans have been born this way. Cab Calloway comes to mind. My particular area of medicine is psychiatry and I like to specialize in the head, you know, not the lower portion of the body - it's much less messy that way. Not that your lower half is messy at all, it's quite beautiful... not that I'm looking It's hurting a bit? "
"Arleen: No, you're driving me crazy "
"Arleen: What, are you a doctor too? "
"Martin: No, I'm a retired cop. "
"Arleen: Well, what took you so long? "
"Martin: Everything's going to be just fine, sweetheart. Now I've delivered more than a few babies in my lifetime and some of them are even older than you are now. Now, Frasier's going to hold your hand and help you with your breathing. And Niles is going to look out for an ambulance and I'm going to get ready to bring your beautiful baby into this world. Okay? "
"Arleen: Okay. "
"Martin: Now, are there any questions? "
"Niles: Yes, should our meter still be running? "
"TO: "
"Daphne: Hello? Are you back yet? "
"Daphne: Well go on, turn your heads. "
"Daphne: Okay. "
"Daphne: So, I guess you've had some excitement tonight. "
"Niles: No, I haven't "
"Daphne: Well, your father sure made it sound exciting on the phone. Delivering a baby in a taxi. "
"Niles: Oh, that. I don't think of that as excitement as much as my sworn duty to use those skills I honed in medical school. "
"Frasier: Yes, Niles ran down to a falafel stand for a pot of hot water. "
"Martin: What I can't get over is that feeling of being there right when a person's life begins. One minute it's just this blob in some lady's stomach, next minute it's a person. Blob - Person "
"Frasier: The miracle of birth summed up in one poetic phrase. "
"Daphne: I bet you have some fond memories of when your son was born. "
"Frasier: Oh yes, of course. I remember the very first time I held him in my arms as a newborn. And it was as if everything in the universe simply melted away. There was just a father, a son and the distant sound of Lilith saying, 'If you ever come near me again, Frasier, I'll drop you with a deer rifle.' "
"Martin: At least nowadays fathers get to see their sons being born. In my day, they stuck us all in the waiting room, smoking cigarettes and reading 'Life' magazine. I still remember the exact article I was reading when Niles was born. It was about Mickey Mantle. Talk about life setting you up for a fall Well, it's been a long night. I'm turning in. "
"Frasier: Night, Dad. "
"Daphne: I can't wait to see what kinds of dreams I have after all this talk about childbearing. Probably that one where my mother shows up and says, 'Well, Daphne, you're fifty now and you've never given me grandchildren.' Then I say, 'That was my choice to make, Mum, I was thinking of my career.' 'Oh sure, your career, but did you ever think of me?' [normal, getting carried "
"away:] 'Mother, I don't want to start this again, just drop it.' 'Oh shut up, mother' 'Don't talk to me like that, young lady...' "
"Frasier: I wonder how many more people she's got in there with her. Sherry, Niles? "
"Niles: No, thank you. "
"Frasier: You seem awfully reflective, is something on your mind? "
"Niles: Actually, yes. For the past several months I've noticed my thoughts often drifting to the same "
"subject: will I ever be a father? "
"Frasier: Ah. "
"Niles: There are pros and cons, of course, but watching that child's birth tonight I realise it's something I really want... I think. "
"Frasier: Well, it's perfectly natural to have parental stirrings around at your age. "
"Niles: Uh, er, no, this is more than stirrings. I wake up nights thinking about it. "
"Frasier: Have you talked this over with Maris? "
"Niles: Not yet. I like to know what I want before Maris tells me. I'm just not sure I'm really ready for fatherhood. "
"Frasier: Well, Niles, no-one's ever really sure. You know, in schools these days, teenagers who are thinking about becoming parents are given a ten-pound sack of flour to keep with them for a week as though it were a baby. "
"Niles: You're kidding? "
"Frasier: No, no, no, they hold it, they care for it, they never let it out of their sight. It gives them a very good idea of the cost and responsibility of being a parent. "
"Niles: Hmm, that's very clever. What could be better than hands-on experience? Might be worth a try. "
"Frasier: Well, I wasn't actually suggesting. "
"Niles: Well, why not? It's the perfect "
"week: Maris is away, I'm desperate to resolve the issue; Frasier, where do you keep the flour? "
"Frasier: In the kitchen. "
"Niles: In the kitchen. "
"Frasier: The cabinet next to the sink. "
"Niles: Yes Here it is. It's taking after his old man all ready "
"Frasier: No Niles, that's the sugar. If we're going to do this, we're going to do it right. "
"Frasier: Now, here is the flour. Bleached, one hundred percent fat free, best when kept in an airtight container. It seems this one's taking after its mother. "
"Frasier: Hello, Niles. "
"Niles: Hello, Frasier, may I join you? Or should I say, may we? "
"Frasier: Mais oui. "
"Frasier: I see you're still continuing with our little baby experiment. "
"Niles: Yes and it's turned out to be quite a learning experience. It's not easy, though. I take him everywhere. Get up for two a.m. feedings, the whole exhausting nine yards. "
"Niles: What a beautiful baby, how old is he? "
"Mother: Eight weeks. "
"Niles: Oh, great age isn't it? "
"Frasier: Niles, I can't help noticing that your child has a little boo-boo. "
"Niles: Oh, it's nothing. I was playing him some Brahms the other night, never too early to ingrain them. I guess I must have begun conducting with one of the gilded chopsticks Maris wears in her bun and I accidentally ran him through. "
"Frasier: What young parent doesn't tell that story? "
"Niles: The scars were just plain carelessness. The fault of my new houseman, Guy. "
"Frasier: What did Guy do? "
"Niles: No, no, Guy. "
"Frasier: Guy. "
"Niles: Back of the throat, Guy. "
"Frasier: Oh, who cares? "
"Niles: He had just given my car the most brilliant shine when I sat the baby on the roof and down it went, down the windshield and onto the driveway. Will you watch him for me while I order? "
"Roz: Hey, Fras. Is this seat taken? "
"Frasier: Well, actually... No. "
"Roz: You'll be happy to know that Clarence is doing a lot better. I just dropped his card off. "
"Frasier: Clarence? "
"Roz: Yeah, Clarence the guard. "
"Frasier: Oh, down at the station, Clarence, oh yes, good. I didn't know he was sick. "
"Roz: You signed his get-well card. "
"Frasier: You mean that wasn't a birthday card? "
"Roz: No, he's in the hospital having a kidney transplant. "
"Frasier: Oh my God, I thought it was his birthday. I wrote, 'Dear Clarence, you're not getting older, you're just getting closer to death' "
"Roz: How could you think it was his birthday? "
"Frasier: I don't know, I guess I just didn't recognise the traditional card for a man in an advanced state of kidney failure was a giant pink bunny rabbit. Do you think he's read it yet? "
"Roz: No, I don't think so. He was sleeping when I left. "
"Frasier: I'm going to look like a callous fool. We've gotta get back down there and get that card back. "
"Niles: I asked you to baby-sit "
"Frasier: Oh, Niles I don't have time to stand here and listen to your insanity, I have to go and steal a get-well card from a kidney patient "
"TO: "
"Daphne: What does that say? Geb? "
"Frasier: 'Get well soon, love Andrea.' Just copy it down, move onto the next name. "
"Frasier: We'll have to transfer all the old names from this card onto the new card, as quickly as possible, I want to get it back there tonight. "
"Daphne: So you actually snuck into a man's hospital room and stole his card? "
"Frasier: I did not sneak in Luckily, the man was in extreme pain and heavily sedated. "
"Martin: This never would have happened if you had taken the time to find out who this Clarence guy was You never pay any attention to the little people in your life. "
"Frasier: Yes, well as soon as we're done with this, why don't we invite all the commoners over to drive me down to the town square and give me a good stoning That must be Niles. He's going to take me down to the hospital. "
"Frasier: Hello Niles. "
"Niles: Hello Frasier. "
"Martin: What are you doing with that thing? "
"Niles: I'm forging a parent-child bond that will last forever. "
"Martin: Well that's a relief, I was afraid it might be something stupid "
"Niles: If it makes you feel any better, I don't wear this in public, I just wanted to get the complete picture of parenthood. "
"Frasier: And? "
"Niles: It's driving me batty "
"Niles: Oh the feedings every two hours. Constant monitoring where he is, I can see how parents can be obsessed with worry. Last night, I actually had a dream my flour sack was abducted and the kidnapper started sending me muffins in the mail. Well, on the plus side, I've learned a lot. I think if I ever undergo through the real thing I'll make quite a wonderful parent. "
"Frasier: Niles What has happened to your child? "
"Niles: I was practicing my Tai Chi exercises this morning and I accidentally kicked him into the reflecting pool. That's when I brought him inside and left him by the hearth to dry. "
"Frasier: He caught on fire? "
"Niles: It's not as careless as you make it seem. After all, a real child would have cried before it burst into flames "
"Niles: Oh, time for his nap. "
"Niles: Turn him over if he starts fussing, will you, dad? "
"Martin: No. "
"Niles: I'm role playing, dad. "
"Martin: Try playing the role of a sane person. "
"Frasier: So Niles, any closer to making a decision about fatherhood? "
"Niles: To tell you the truth, no. At one minute I think there's no chance in hell I'll ever be able to stand the stress. The next I find myself daydreaming about taking my son on his first trip to the museum or listening to him pick out his first feeble 'Für Elise' on the piano and I swear there are tears in my eyes. "
"Frasier: Oh, dear. "
"Niles: What? "
"Frasier: Eddie. "
"Daphne: That dingo's got your baby "
"Niles: Oh God, Eddie "
"Daphne: Don't worry, I'll clean up that mess, Dr. Crane. "
"Niles: Oh my God. "
"Martin: For God's sake, Niles, calm down. I think it's time you realized something. That is not a person, it's a bag of flour. There's an easy trick to tell the "
"difference: people don't usually come with pop-over recipes on their backs. This whole thing's stupid. We're talking about having a baby here. You don't make that decision intellectually, you make it in here. In your gut. You must have a gut feeling, Niles - what is it? "
"Niles: I'm not sure. "
"Martin: Well, you better be because no amount of thinking can prepare you for what having a kid is really like. It's hard, full of surprises. Like maybe your kid won't want to take piano lessons or go to the museum. He might want to go to a baseball game. "
"Niles: Don't even say that. "
"Martin: Just trust yourself, son. That's all. You'll know if it's right or not. "
"Frasier: Well, Niles, I'm finished with this now, if you're ready to take me to the hospital. "
"Niles: You know Frasier, I'm beginning to wonder if this whole experiment wasn't just a way of convincing myself that I'm ready for something when I know in my heart, I'm not. "
"Frasier: What do you mean? "
"Niles: I want to have a baby, but I just don't want it enough. That's the hardest thing I've ever had to admit. "
"Frasier: Why do you say that? "
"Niles: Oh, because it's so selfish. I'm the right age, I have the money, the energy. "
"Frasier: Niles, it's only selfish when people have babies for the wrong reasons. I think more people should do what you did and find out if they're really ready. Look, just because you feel this way now doesn't mean things can't change a few years down the line. "
"Niles: Perhaps you're right. Of course, Maris and I will be over forty then. Maybe it wouldn't hurt to look into getting some of her eggs frozen. "
"Frasier: Ooh, I suspect they're only a few degrees away from that now. "
"TO: "
"Niles: You're certainly going to a lot of trouble for this Clarence fellow. Who is he? "
"Frasier: Beats me. Some guy down at the station. "
"Clarence: Dr. Crane It's Clarence. You weren't in there looking for me, were you? "
"Frasier: As a matter of fact I was, yes. "
"Clarence: They changed my room. "
"Mary: Oh, this is so sweet of you. "
"Frasier: Well, you know, Clarence is such a fixture down at the station. I just haven't felt the same there without him. "
"Clarence: You find the time to come down here while the rest of those bums at the station don't even send me a card. "
"Frasier: Gee, Clarence, there's an explanation for that... ' Frasier quickly shuts the "
"Frasier: You see, the others at the station, they just don't know you the way I do. Yes, well you get yourself well and get right back there. I miss seeing you every time I walk by the.... place you tend to be. Niles. "
"Frasier: Niles, what are you doing? "
"Niles: Looking at these babies. I can't help wondering if I made the right decision. "
"Frasier: Niles... "
"Niles: Oh look at them, they're healthy, beautiful, lovable... "
"Frasier: Flammable "
"Niles: How can I deny myself this experience? Maybe I'm more ready for parenthood than I thought. "
"Arleen: Hey, what are you guys doing here? "
"Frasier: How funny running into you, and this must be... "
"Arleen: Yes, little Nathan. Oh, I'm so glad I ran into you. We both want to thank you guys again. So, would one of you like to hold him? "
"Niles: Yes. Shush [Nathan starts crying] Why shouldn't you cry? Everything's so new to you, so much to do, a life to live. "
"Arleen: No, you've got his leg pinned back. "
"Arleen: Well, see you guys. Say hi to your dad for me. "
"Niles: Perhaps I made the right decision. "
"Frasier: Oh, I think so. Ready to go? "
"Niles: Uh-huh. "

"Frasier: Thank you for your call, Lorraine. And now, before we break for a commercial, Roz has an important message. Roz? "
"Frasier: What's that, Roz? Can't come to the mike right now? Well, what she wanted to say was... "
"Frasier: Tomorrow, on Amber Edwards's 'Book Chat,' sociologist Lamont Myman discusses his book, 'Violence in the "
"Workplace: Why Co-Workers Kill.' Something which becomes more relevant With each passing moment. We'll be right back after these messages. "
"TO: the hallway. "
"Roz: Cough it up, you piece of tin "
"Frasier: Roz "
"Roz: What are you doing out here? "
"Frasier: One might ask the same question of you. Isn't it customary to wait until the show comes to a complete stop before exiting? "
"Roz: I have a little urge. Damn it "
"Frasier: What is the matter with you? "
"Roz: I have GOT to have some CHOCOLATE It's kind of a celebration. At 11"
":07 this morning, I finished one of those magazine "
"diets: Seven Days to a Healthier, Calmer You. "
"Frasier: Now, Roz. Come on, come on, Roz, come on. Look, I'm doing this for your own good. "
"Roz: Wait Something came out. Oh, damn Chocolate covered raisins. "
"Roz: I'd like to meet the idiot that came up with these. Take a grape, let it shrivel into a disgusting little wart and cover it with perfectly good chocolate. What the hell. I'll just suck the chocolate off. "
"Frasier: Be sure to save what's left, maybe you can make some wine. "
"Niles: See all those years of finishing school really paid off. "
"Niles: Mon frere? "
"Frasier: Hmm? "
"Niles: We're in luck "
"Niles: I've just come back from my broker. Meadow Wood Properties still has one share left in that mini-mall deal, I think we should go halfsies and buy it. Give me five, bro. "
"Frasier: I'm not giving you anything. I told you I'm not interested. "
"Niles: You can't afford not to be interested. It's a twelve percent return. We've a chance to make a real killing here. "
"Frasier: Niles, why is it so important to you? You and Maris are already wallowing in money like a couple of yuppie hogs. "
"Niles: This has nothing to do Maris. I'm making this investment entirely with my own money. "
"Frasier: And mine "
"Niles: And yours "
"Roz: Oh, come on, Frasier, show some understanding. Maris uses her money to emasculate the poor guy, and this is his pathetic attempt to stop feeling like a financial eunuch and regain some shred of his former manhood. Such as it was. "
"Niles: Well? "
"Frasier: Twelve percent? "
"Niles: Net And, if you're unhappy at the end of the year, I'll buy you out and you can go back to that cozy two percent your bank is giving you. "
"Frasier: Okay, okay. I'm in. "
"Niles: Oh, thank you Frasier "
"Niles: And thank you, Roz. That 'financial eunuch' bit was inspired. Great stuff, great stuff. "
"Roz: Yeah, well, look what I had to work with. "
"Martin: Hey, check this baby "
"out: twenty-five cents off on a package of Butter Buds imitation utter. "
"Frasier: My, I can taste that scampi now. "
"Daphne: Well? "
"Frasier: Well, Daphne, very nice. "
"Daphne: Thank you. "
"Frasier: No, thank YOU. "
"Daphne: I'd be more flattered if I didn't know how hard up you both are right now. I'm going out with Derek again tonight. But I'm having trouble choosing a fragrance. I've got it pinned down to these two. “Heather” - fresh and bouncy as a spring morning, or “Forbidden” – your passport to erotic realms of pleasure. "
"Martin: How many times you been out with this guy? "
"Daphne: This is our third date. "
"Both: Forbidden. "
"Daphne: Why is it so important this is our third date? "
"Frasier: Well, Daphne, sexual mores being what they are in America, the third date is usually the place where two healthy adults decide whether or not to... take it to the next level. "
"Daphne: Excuse me? What kind of a randy custom is that? First date, second date, whoops, let's all pitch our knickers? "
"Daphne: The third date may mean that to you Americans, [She opens the door to reveal Niles.] but it takes more than three dinners to get bangers and mash with Daphne Moon. "
"Daphne: Hello, Dr. Crane. "
"Niles: Hello, Daphne. You look even lovelier than usual this evening. "
"Daphne: Thank you. "
"Niles: Is that 'Forbidden'? "
"Frasier: In every sense of the word "
"Daphne: I think I'll just scrub me neck with an unscented soap. If you ask me, you Americans have an unhealthy obsession with sex. "
"Martin: Hey, I'm sorry we can't all be as chaste and restrained as the Royal Family. "
"Frasier: Good one, Dad "
"Martin: I've been savin' it "
"Niles: Frasier, I come bearing good news. I just spoke to my "
"broker: Meadow Wood Properties has already leased eighty-five percent of the space in the proposed mini-mall. Instead of twelve percent, they are projecting a fifteen percent return on our money "
"Frasier: This is fantastic What say we go celebrate with a nice dinner at an exclusive boite? "
"Niles: Yes, but the question remains, what boite? "
"Frasier: Charise? "
"Niles: Too noisy. "
"Frasier: Alsace? "
"Niles: Too bright. "
"Frasier: Papillion? "
"Niles: Too crowded. "
"Frasier: We've run out of boites. "
"Niles: A city this size and only three boites. "
"Frasier: How do we live? "
"Martin: Hey, I'm goin' down to Duke's. What are you guys doin'? "
"Frasier: Well, we're trying to find some place to eat. "
"Martin: Well, when you get through, why don't you swing by and have a beer with me? "
"Frasier: At Duke's? "
"Martin: Yeah. "
"Niles: Us? "
"Martin: Yeah. "
"Frasier: With you? "
"Martin: What am I speaking, Swahili? Yeah You two. At Duke's. With me. A beer. If you want. Geez "
"Niles: My God, do you believe that? "
"Frasier: No. No one in the family's ever been invited to Duke's. "
"Niles: Not even Mother, and there were times she could be quite the old rummy. "
"Frasier: I wonder why now, after thirty years, he's suddenly inviting us down there. "
"Daphne: Cheerio. "
"Frasier: Daphne, Daphne. Has Dad said anything to you about us and Duke's? Has he been planning this? "
"Daphne: You mean... behind your backs? "
"Niles: Precisely. "
"Daphne: No What a couple of Wallys I mean, I have never met a family that worked so hard at being uncomfortable with each other. Could it be that he just wants to lift a pint with his sons? "
"Niles: No. Duke's is where Dad hangs up with his cop buddies. Where he goes to escape the stresses, strains and petty annoyances of everyday life. "
"Frasier: In other words, us. "
"Daphne: Well, I suppose you could sit around here analyzing why he invited you and end up frittering the night away. Or, here's a "
"thought: you could just go down there and find out for yourselves. "
"Frasier: You know, for a lay person, she has a way of cuttin' right through the crap, doesn't she? "
"Niles: Oh, my God, it's a room full of Dads. "
"Frasier: Oh, look, there he is, there he is Oh, look at him, holding court. No wonder he likes it down here so much, they're all hanging on his every word. "
"Niles: Wow, that's the most fun I've ever seen him have without a remote control in his hands. "
"Martin: Hey, Frasier, Niles I'm glad you could make it. Yeah, come on in, I want you to meet some of the guys I was on the force with. Hey guys, these are my boys. This is Frasier, he's on the radio. "
"Joe: Hey, this is Marty's kid, the guy on the radio "
"Joe: Hey, Frasier. Joe Herman. Nice to meet you. Hey, check this out. 'I'm listening.' "
"Frasier: It's like hearing a recording of myself. "
"Niles: Dad? Dad, Dad. "
"Martin: What? Oh, yeah, and this is my other son, Niles. He's a psychiatrist, too. He married money ' and 'Way to go' Niles takes the "
"Martin: Hey, Duke. Duke, come on, I want you to meet my boys. Yeah, this is Frasier, and this is Niles. "
"Duke: Hey, how are ya? Hey, how about a couple of Duke's Specials for you guys? "
"Niles: And what would those be? "
"Duke: Boilermaker. A shot of whiskey, beer back. "
"Niles: Oh, darn, we've been drinking those all night. Maybe it's time we switched to sherry. [off Martin and Frasier's looks] Two boilermakers, please. "
"Duke: It's great finally meetin' you guys. Martin's been tellin' us about you since you were kids. "
"Frasier: Aw, Dad. "
"Duke: I tell you Frasier, we all felt terrible when you heard your wife was screwin' around behind your back. What was her name again? "
"Everyone: Lilith "
"Martin: Hey, it was a slow night, all right? [He grabs his beer and goes out on the floor.] All right, all right everybody, settle down here, settle down. I wanna make a toast. For thirty years, Duke's has been my home away from home. I look around here tonight and I see a lot of friends, and I wanna say I'm gonna miss you. And I'm gonna miss this joint too. And may there be a special place in hell for those SOBs who are tearin' it down to build some damn mini-mall. "
"Everyone: Yeah "
"Martin: Those snivelling, rat-face bastards from Meadow Wood Properties "
"Everyone: Yeah "
"Martin: To Duke's "
"Everyone: To Duke's "
"Frasier: Two more "
"Niles: Did you talk to your lawyer? "
"Frasier: Yes, he's examined the contract. Our checks have cleared. I even talked to the general partner, he says there's no way they're willing to even consider moving the site. The deal's going through. "
"Niles: Maybe we could have Duke's declared a historical landmark, it's been there forty years. "
"Frasier: I doubt that, Niles. They already tore down Seattle's first Pony Express office to build this place. "
"Niles: Damn "
"Roz: Here you go, guys, one cappuccino, one latte, and hey, these are on me. "
"Frasier: Oh "
"Niles: This guilt is driving me crazy. "
"Roz: It should, you make about ten times more than I do. "
"Niles: Duke's was his whole life. "
"Frasier: Well, Niles, there's nothing we can do about it, really. You know, look at it this "
"way: we're actually doing Dad a service, stopping him from going out and drinking. And the other policemen as well. Maybe we're even performing a community service. Men with guns will have one less place to go and liquor up. "
"Niles: There's always Roz's place. "
"Roz: Well, what do you say about me when I'm not around? "
"Niles: I think the only way I'm going to feel better is if I just bite the bullet and tell Dad. "
"Roz: The way I see it, your situation is like a woman who has one crazy night and cheats on her boyfriend. And the only reason for this woman to confess is to make herself feel better. So, the best thing she can do is just keep her mouth shut. Unless, of course, her boyfriend walks in on her and the other guy because he decides to come home from Portland on the midnight flight instead of driving back like he said he would, so in that case, he's the liar and why should she feel bad? "
"Frasier: Thank you, Roz, for that purely theoretical example. Fact is, I happen to agree with you. Niles, if we tell him now, it will only hurt him. We've got to keep this quiet. "
"Niles: All right, I just don't think it can be done. "
"Frasier: Of course it can be done "
"Niles: You mean to say, you can look Dad in the eye, day after day, knowing you have destroyed his sanctuary, and not tell him? You can live with that? "
"Frasier: Niles, you're "
"forgetting: I married Lilith, I can live with anything. "
"Frasier: You buy into an investment GROUP, Eddie, you don't know "
"Frasier: Oh, hi, Dad. What are you doing up? "
"Martin: Oh, I reached over in my sleep and Eddie wasn't there. "
"Frasier: You need a woman, Dad. "
"Martin: Tell me about it. Oh, you turned the sign on. That was nice of Duke to give to me. You hold a glass of beer in front of it, it turns green. "
"Frasier: Dad, Niles and I are investors in the company that's tearing down Duke's. "
"Frasier: We didn't know When we found out, we tried to get out of it, but we couldn't. "
"Frasier: Oh, geez, yell at me Dad, will you please? Just hit me or something, hit me with your cane. Just don't stand there. "
"Martin: Let me see if I got this "
"right: in the last year, you give my chair away, you lose my dog, and now you demolish my bar. What's next? I'm gonna find out you're the one who shot me in the hip? "
"Frasier: I have an alibi for that one. "
"Martin: You have an alibi for everything. "
"Frasier: Dad, it's not like I did this on purpose, I'm part of a huge investment group. "
"Martin: You know, I don't get it. You guys stood there and watched me and my friends get all weepy and you didn't say anything. "
"Frasier: Well, what did you want us to say? 'Say fellas, here's something ironic...' "
"Martin: Well, why the hell didn't you at least tell me? "
"Frasier: I don't know. I guess... I guess maybe it was because when you invited me down to Duke's, it felt like we were finally getting closer. It was a momentous step. "
"Martin: It was a beer "
"Frasier: Not to me It was validation. Finally I was one of the guys you wanted to hang out with. I, I didn't want to spoil that. "
"Martin: I woulda had you down there before, I just figured it was the kinda place you'd look down your nose at. "
"Frasier: Well, you're probably right. Anyway, I'm sorry. "
"Martin: Well maybe I spent too much time at Duke's anyway. "
"Frasier: What do you mean? "
"Martin: Oh, you know. When you kids were growing up, maybe if I'd spent less time at Duke's and more time with you, maybe I'd be sittin' across from a son who put so much stock in one beer. "
"Frasier: You know, I was actually having a pretty good time down there at Duke's. Until I found out I was the one responsible for obliterating it from the face of the planet. "
"Martin: I liked havin' you there, too, son. "
"Frasier: Thanks, Dad. "
"Frasier: Do you mind, Dad? It's driving me crazy, it looks like hell. "
"Martin: Hey, you know what? We got a couple hours before that wrecking ball comes. How 'bout you and I go down there and have one more beer? "
"Frasier: To Duke's? "
"Martin: Yeah. "
"Frasier: Now? "
"Martin: Yeah. "
"Frasier: You and me? Us, together? "
"Martin: Oh, not this again "
"Frasier: Yeah, yeah, all right, great "
"Martin: Just you, me, and Charlie Ballantine. "
"Frasier: I'll meet you right back here in a minute. "
"Frasier: Oh, good evening, Daphne. Or should I say, good morning? "
"Frasier: How was your... date with Derek? "
"Daphne: We had a wonderful time. First we went to dinner, then to the symphony. Then we took a lovely moonlight stroll through the park. He's a perfect gentleman, is Derek. "
"Frasier: Apparently, in England, it's the fourth date. "
"Both: ...and I'll be here, in sunshine or in shadow. Oh, Danny boy, oh, Danny boy, I love you so... [Martin signals Frasier to raise his pitch, they finish] "
"Martin: That was good. That reminds me of old Mickey Doogan. I remember one Fourth of July, we were on mounted patrol, leadin' a big parade down Broad Street. It was a real scorcher that day, musta been a hundred degrees, and I'm sittin' on top of a thousand pounds of hot, sweaty horse. I musta been complainin' a bit, 'cause as we ride by Duke's, Mickey gets fed up and says 'If you want a damn beer so bad, shut up and get one.' So I ride old Agides right through the front door, right up to the bar and order myself a beer. Duke plays it cool as a cucumber and says 'And what'll your friend have?' I say, 'Nothin', he's drivin.' "
"Martin: I’ve told ya that one before, haven't I? "
"Frasier: Yeah. "
"Martin: Oh, what a place. "
"Frasier: You want another beer, Dad? "
"Martin: Sure, why not? "
"Martin: Sun's up. You look around this place, in the golden early morning light... it's still a dump. I'm gonna miss it, though. "
"Frasier: Yeah, I know what it is to have a neighborhood bar. I remember the last time I walked out of my old watering hole back in Boston. A strangely emotional day. "
"Martin: It's the people, I guess. Saying goodbye to a lot of people. "
"Frasier: You know, Dad, just because you're saying goodbye to this place, doesn't mean you can't see your buddies just as much as you always did. "
"Martin: Yeah, it does. "
"Frasier: Yeah, you're right. "
"Martin: But that's life, huh? You move on. Only a fool tries to fight it. "
"Martin: What are you doing here? "
"Niles: I'm here to stop the demolition. What are you doing here? "
"Martin: We came to say goodbye. "
"Niles: You may not have to. I've alerted my lawyers. I intend to stand here and face down the bulldozers. I'm prepared to take this thing to the highest court in the land. "
"Frasier: Niles, you don't have to do that. I've had a discussion with Dad, he forgives us. "
"Martin: Sure son, don't worry about it. It's okay. "
"Niles: Is it really okay? I think NOT Because today it's Duke's, but tomorrow, it's Moe's. And the day after that, it's Ernie's Tap Room. See, I'm not just here for you, Dad. I'm doin' this for every little guy out there who found some solace at the end of a hard day by bellying up at his neighborhood bar. I'm here to show faceless corporate America they can't just come in here without so much as a 'How de do' and shove the little guy aside. Even when I'M that faceless corporate America I'm here to fight the good fight, to show those sniveling rat-faced heathens there's still some fury pounding in the heart of John Q. Public "
"Niles: On the other hand, who am I to stand in the way of progress? "

"Frasier: Look at this My so called 'wind proof' umbrella. "
"Frasier: I might as well use one of those little paper ones they put in Polynesian drinks "
"Roz: I've got a big collection of those; they remind me of wonderful evenings that I can't remember. You know, I've got some requests here for some personal appearances. City College wants you to lecture... "
"Frasier: Fine, just tell me the date. "
"Roz: Okay. St. Bartholomew’s Hospital wants you to emcee their annual benefit. "
"Frasier: Pass. "
"Roz: What, you're turning down a hospital? "
"Frasier: Yes. "
"Frasier: Don't look at me that way. "
"Roz: Hey, I'm with you, I hate the way those whiny sick people are always nagging you for things. 'I want a magazine, I want a kidney' "
"Frasier: Roz, I have as much sympathy for sick people as you do, which is why I said yes when they asked me to appear last year. I bought an Armani tuxedo, spent a week working on my speech, postponed a trip to go see Frederick; then on the morning of the dinner they called me, told me they didn't need me because their first choice had become "
"available: the irrepressible Kathie Lee Gifford "
"Roz: God, way to hold a grudge "
"Frasier: This is not about spite. This is about dignity. Dignity is a rare and fragile thing. Any other requests? "
"Roz: Yeah, the Teenage Seattle pageant wants you to be a judge. "
"Frasier: Oh, I'll do that. "
"Roz: That's real dignified "
"Frasier: A scholarship is involved "
"Roz: Right. You're on in ten seconds. We have new sponsors and the sales department wants you to work this copy in as often as you can. "
"Frasier: Good Afternoon, Seattle. This is Dr. Frasier Crane, KACL 780. Well, it's another gray, depressing day here in the Emerald City. Here's hoping we can brighten up your afternoon. We hold it our personal duty to banish your rainy day blues. But first a message from our sponsors. 'Death is inevitable.” "
"Frasier: 'But it's especially painful when it claims a beloved family pet. If you've lost, or are planning to lose, a cherished dog, cat or bird, let Pet Paradise console you with a tasteful Plexiglas memorial bearing the likeness of your departed friend. Pet Paradise - ‘though your pet may be small, your loss is great.’” Who's our first caller, Roz? "
"Roz: We have Edna on line two, she's a receptionist at a pest control company and she's feeling depressed. "
"Frasier: Hello, Edna, I'm listening. "
"Edna: Hello, Dr. Crane. I've been working at pest control for fifteen years. I go in every day, answer the same calls, ask the same questions. 'What kind of bugs are they?' 'Have you seen any droppings?' Then I go to the next person. 'What kind of bugs are they?' 'Have you seen any droppings?' "
"Frasier: Edna, I'm a psychiatrist, I can sense where this is going. Now, even the most interesting of lives can become routine. What you need to do is shake up your world, find a new boyfriend, a new job, a new city even. "
"Edna: You mean move? "
"Frasier: Certainly there are far easier places to cheer up than this dreary, soggy old city of ours. "
"Edna: You know something, Dr. Crane, you're right. I don't have to stay here. When you think about it, there's a whole world of vermin out there "
"Frasier: Very eloquently put, Edna. Thank you for your call. "
"Frasier: Speaking of vermin... 'When that special rat of yours turns his little toes up for the last time, don't forget your friends at Pet Paradise. Pet Paradise – ‘when a shoe box isn't enough.’” "
"Frasier: Another radiant morning Morning, dad. Do I drive to work today or just hail a passing gondola? "
"Martin: I like the rain, it chases those squeegee guys off the street. "
"Daphne: Now stay put until I can dry off your feet. "
"Frasier: There, that ought to do it "
"Martin: Oh, Daphne, get that hat off him. Isn't it bad enough we had him neutered? "
"Daphne: Look, by the way things are going, I don't think I'm going to have children. Just let me dress up the dog "
"Martin: I've never seen a dog look that stupid. "
"Daphne: You'll change your tune when you see the outfit I got him for St. Patrick's Day "
"Martin: Hey, get a load of this. Derek Mann mentioned you in his column. 'I've been listening to Frasier Crane this week because I've been trying to drop a few pounds; I find his voice makes an effective appetite suppressant' "
"Frasier: How witty "
"Martin: "
"Frasier: Give me that 'Yesterday, I heard him advise an unhappy young woman that she could magically cure her depression simply by leaving Seattle. I know it would cure my depression if the Seattle-hating Dr. Crane would take his own advice and leave town as soon as possible' It's just ludicrous, I never said any such thing "
"Daphne: Oh, yes, you did. I heard you. You said Seattle was dreary and if she wanted to spruce up her life, she should leave town. "
"Frasier: Well, that was just one of several suggestions I made. He took that completely out of context. "
"Martin: Well, whatever you said, you're gonna apologize, right? "
"Frasier: What for? "
"Martin: For insulting Seattle People round here take a lot of pride in this town, they don't appreciate some radio know-it-all telling them it's rainy and depressing. "
"Frasier: In case you haven't noticed, Dad, it does get a little damp around here For God's sake, the state flower is Mildew "
"Martin: Let me tell you "
"something: a city's like a woman. You get one mad at you, it doesn't matter if you're completely right and she's completely wrong, you'll apologize anyway, or you'll be paying for it for the rest of your life "
"Daphne: I'm not sure I care for that analogy. "
"Martin: Oh, gee, I'm sorry, Daphne, I was way out of line. "
"Daphne: All right, you're forgiven. "
"Frasier: You know, Dad, to you, everything is like a woman. A fast car is like a woman, a romantic song is like a woman, good meatloaf is like a woman. Well, a city is not like a woman, it's like a city and I am not apologizing to this one. Even if you won't understand that, Seattle does And Seattle loves Frasier Crane "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Hello, Father Mike. "
"Mike: Hello, Frasier. "
"Roz: Look, Dr. Crane was not bashing Seattle, he was sincerely trying to help that woman Who’s our sponsor? Pet Paradise. Well fine, go ahead and boycott them - see how easy it is to flush your dead German Shepherd down the toilet "
"Frasier: Don't tell me, was that a complaint about this rain business? "
"Roz: Yes and thanks to you I've been on the phone all morning. "
"Frasier: Oh, well, forgive me. From now on I'll stick to subjects like suicide and birth control, stay away from the controversial stuff like weather "
"Bulldog: Hey, Doc. I need some advice. I feel a cold coming on and I'm wondering, should I take vitamin C or should I just leave Seattle? "
"Roz: I hope you're happy According to Betsy, the switchboard has logged over fifty irate calls "
"Bulldog: Fifty? Damn, you topped my record The most I ever got was thirty-five when I said that commentary, 'Lady Umpires - Finally a Chest Worth Protecting' "
"Roz: You know, Frasier, you really should think about apologizing. "
"Frasier: You know, I'd be the first to apologize if I said anything wrong but I didn't. "
"Roz: I've got half a dozen calls stacked up in there, and they all said you did. "
"Frasier: Yes, well, just take messages from all those people – I don't want to talk to them. "
"Roz: You know, I don't know how to break this to you... but it's a call-in show "
"TO: "
"Connie: I don't know how you can say Seattle is a depressing place. I spent the last forty years in this city working the graveyard shift at a cemetery And let me tell you something, you fat-headed "
"moron: I am probably the most cheerful person you'll ever meet "
"Frasier: You're certainly the most cheerful I've met today [Roz mimes him to smile] Alas, we're out of time. I'd like to just say, as I've been saying for the last three hours, it was not my intent to cause anyone offense but since it seems obvious that I have, I would like to say "
"this: I apologize. I do not find Seattle a depressing place to live. It would take more than clouds to obscure the beauty of her landscape and more than drizzle to dampen the warmth and good fellowship that makes Seattle the only place in this bad old world that I care to call home. Till Monday then, this is Dr. Frasier Crane, signing off. "
"Frasier: Good grief Never in my life have I heard from such a bunch of whiny, provincial crybabies. I swear to God, this entire city has lost it's tiny, rain-addled mind "
"Roz: Dr. Crane, we're still on the air. "
"Frasier: Thank you, Roz. "
"Roz: Now we're off "
"TO: "
"Niles: This goes here and that attaches there "
"Daphne: Dr. Crane, are you sure you don't want me to try my hand there? "
"Niles: No, no, Daphne, this is no job for you. You might crack a nail or snag a cuticle. There, are we getting anything? "
"Martin: Does annoyed count? "
"Daphne: Oh, hush. If you hadn't bashed it with your cane because your precious Seahawks lost, we wouldn't need a new set now, would we? Isn't there a manual? "
"Niles: Yes, but unfortunately Stephen Hawking is not here to explain it to us "
"Martin: God, I thought the winds had eased up out there "
"Frasier: They have. "
"Daphne: Then what happened to your umbrella? "
"Frasier: One of my listeners recognized me on the street, he pulled it backwards through a chain link fence You would not believe the hostility I've encountered. Even at the Café Nervosa, my sanctuary, I thought they were trying out the new cappuccino maker - I turned and saw three tables hissing at me "
"Martin: Don't answer that, Daphne. "
"Daphne: I can't abide the sound of a ringing phone. "
"Martin: It's just going to be another crank complaining about Frasier, they've been calling here all day "
"Frasier: Oh, no, they've got my home number now? "
"Daphne: Yes, but, just because the phone rings doesn't mean we have to answer it. "
"Daphne: Even though it could be Frederick calling to say he loves you or Grammy Moon calling to say her hip's gone out again. "
"Daphne: Still, we can't be swayed by a little ringing bell. Just because it's going ring... ring... ring. "
"Daphne: Or in the case of a British telephone; Ring-ring... ring- ring... ring-ring... ring-ring... ring-ring.... "
"Frasier: Just answer it, for God's sake "
"Daphne: Thank you "
"Daphne: Crane residence. Oh, no, I'm afraid he can't come to the phone, may I take a message? Oh, nice language that I hope you don't eat with that mouth "
"Niles: Daphne, Daphne, excuse me. [takes receiver and speaks into phone] Now see here, how dare you speak to a lady that way. Yes, well, that's no excuse, ma’am Well, only a coward makes threats over the phone, I dare you to come here and say that to my face. Never you mind where I live "
"Frasier: Is anyone expecting visitors? Well, I suggest we all remain very, very quiet. "
"Niles: I suddenly have this image of angry villagers wielding torches and pitchforks. "
"Roz: Frasier, open up, it's Roz "
"Niles: Oh dear, it's worse than I thought "
"Frasier: Roz, what are you doing out on this ungodly night? "
"Roz: I tried calling but your line is busy. "
"Martin: Hey, Roz. "
"Roz: Hey, Martin. How are you doing? "
"Martin: Great. "
"Roz: Is that a new TV? "
"Martin: Yeah. "
"Roz: It looks great. Did you get it hooked up yet? "
"Martin: No, I decided I'd let Niles take a crack at it first "
"Roz: Martin you're awful. Frasier, after you left, the station manager stopped by. He's taking a lot of heat from the sponsors and he says if you cannot smooth this over, he may have to suspend you. "
"Frasier: Suspend me? Well, what's he going to put in my timeslot? "
"Roz: He'd have to run 'The Best Of Crane.' "
"Martin: What will he do on the second day? "
"Frasier: I don't know how I'm ever going to smooth this over. The entire city is out to lynch me. "
"Roz: Tell me about it. This guy I know at the gym cancelled on me when he found out I worked for you. You've been alienating my boyfriends "
"Frasier: Oh, well, we can't afford to lose a demographic as large as that "
"Roz: Look, what we need here is a little damage control. Now it's still not too late to call the people at St. Bart's hospital and tell them you'll speak at their fundraiser. "
"Frasier: After the way they treated me last year? "
"Roz: It's a big event, there'll be lots of media there, this is a perfect chance for you to redeem yourself. "
"Martin: Listen to Roz. "
"Frasier: Oh, Dad, just stay out of this "
"Martin: Why? If you take my advice... "
"Frasier: I did take your advice, I apologized. "
"Martin: Oh, so sincerely "
"Roz: What is the big deal? You'll make a few jokes, a few self- deprecating remarks, you'll be helping sick people and showing everyone you know how to laugh at yourself. "
"Niles: I think it's a brilliant suggestion. "
"Roz: My God, Niles, did you just compliment me? "
"Niles: Indeed I did. You're very savvy, Roz. You remind me of one of those cleverly amoral PR flacks who sell their services to industries that pollute "
"Frasier: You really think it's a good idea, Niles? "
"Niles: Well, worked for Nancy Reagan. After her first year in the White House she was widely criticized for her lavish spending. She responding by appearing at a satirical dinner wearing cheap store clothes and performing 'Secondhand Rose.' "
"Daphne: And that made people like her again? "
"Niles: Yes, briefly. "
"Frasier: Oh, what the hell. Tell them I'll emcee. You know, better yet, tell them I'll take a whole table at the banquet. "
"Roz: I already did. You owe those nuns eight hundred bucks. "
"Frasier: Eight hundred...? "
"Roz: Don't mess with them "
"Frasier: I've put myself in such a precarious position, I've got to choose my material very carefully. "
"Niles: Ooh, I know some good jokes. "
"Frasier: No, Niles, you don't "
"Roz: If it's jokes you need, feel free to use some of mine. "
"Frasier: I'm sure the nuns would just love that. Why don't I call Bulldog and ask him for a couple of limericks from his Nantucket series? I'll just call Father Mike, I'm sure he knows a couple of inoffensive jokes. "
"Frasier: Hello? Yes, well, you know, I don't care how you feel I want to use the phone right now Daphne, your grandmother's hip was out again. "
"Joselia: I do hope you'll have some humorous stories for us. Though, of course, nothing too racy or risqué. "
"Frasier: Oh, no, no, of course not, I wouldn't dream of it. "
"Joselia: Good. Last year, Kathie Lee Gifford told the most unfortunate story involving newlyweds and a ski lift "
"Mike: Hello, all. Thank you for coming out for such a good cause. "
"Martin: Hey, I'd support this cause anytime. St. Bart's is where I had my hip surgery, they treated me good. "
"Mike: Oh, I just saw Frasier. I must say, he seems a bit nervous. "
"Roz: Well, he ought to be, there's a lot riding on his performance tonight. "
"Daphne: Well, thank goodness he's got that sweet old nun there to comfort him. "
"Martin: She's not so sweet That's Sister Joselia, the Better known as 'The Terror of Ward Three' "
"Daphne: Do you remember her? "
"Martin: Hey, you know that nightmare where I wake up screaming, 'Not the sponge Not the sponge' "
"Roz: You know when I was a girl, I considered being a nun. "
"Mike: Really, what changed your mind? "
"Roz: I didn't want to work weekends "
"Martin: Hey, where did Maris go? "
"Mike: Well, I believe Mrs. Crane is over there. "
"Niles: Where? Oh, bless her busy little heart, she's cornered Lydia Beaumont, head of the museum board. Maris has been angling to get on that board for years. "
"Martin: It looks like Lydia's getting away. "
"Niles: Oh, yes, the old freshen-the-drink ploy. Poor old Lydia has no idea with whom she's dealing. That's right, Maris, chug that sherry, on with the chase There she goes, she's gaining, she's gaining, she's coming round the ice sculpture; It's Mrs. Beaumont and Maris, Mrs. Beaumont and Maris, and... Yes They meet again "
"Niles: I fully expect they'll be board mates before they clear away the desserts. "
"Daphne: Oh, Dr. Crane, we were just saying how handsome and confident you were looking. "
"Frasier: Really? "
"Niles: Absolutely Forehead. "
"Mike: Did you memorize those jokes I gave you? "
"Frasier: Yes, yes, they're the reason I look so handsome and confident. "
"Roz: Shouldn't they have started this thing by now? "
"Frasier: Oh, well, we're waiting for Bishop Cologie, he's supposed to be introducing me. "
"Mike: I'm sure he'll be here any minute. Break a leg, Frasier. "
"Martin: Now, listen, I've done a few bolwing banquets in my time - the thing to remember is keep smiling and look like you're having a good time. "
"Frasier: Right. "
"Martin: And if a joke bombs, don't pay any attention to it. Do what Johnny Carson used to do - just make a joke about how bad it is. Hmmm? Bomb-o "
"Martin: I miss that guy "
"Roz: Your dad's right, Frasier, just go up there and be confident. "
"Frasier: Yes, well, I'll do that just as soon as I find a men's room. "
"Niles: Oh, you'll be fine, you've just got a few butterflies in your stomach. "
"Frasier: Not for long, I won't. I'll be right back. "
"Mike: Good evening, I'm Father Mike Mancuso and I've just been asked to make a very sad announcement. As you now, every year, our guest speaker has been introduced by Bishop Cologie, our chairman and host of the popular Sunday morning cable TV show, 'Pancakes and Parables.' However, we've just been informed that the Bishop has suffered a terrible accident. [audience gasp] It seems that he was out fishing this afternoon when his boat was hit by a storm and capsized. At the moment he remains missing. However, I will keep you abreast of any further developments. "
"Niles: Why does everything happen to Frasier? "
"Mike: But, fazed as you are, we know how much this evening means to the Bishop and how he delights in entertaining us each year with his biblical hand shadows. We also know that he would be the first to insist that we proceed without him. So, I'm going to step in and introduce this year's speaker. Won't you extend a cordial, gracious welcome to my friend and colleague, Dr. Frasier Crane. Dr. Crane? Dr. Crane? "
"Mike: Ah... "
"Frasier: Thank you, Father Mike. Thank you very much. I can't tell you what a honor it is to be here this evening. I expected the Bishop to introduce me but I'm sure he'll drift in eventually. "
"Frasier: You know, it's a real comfort to see so many priests out there in the audience. These days I don't dare speak in public without someone standing by who can perform the last rites. Whoa Very religious crowd, I see. I can tell because of the vow of silence I hope you've got some holy water standing by there, father, I'm dying here. And speaking of water That reminds me of a little story. A Rabbi, a Minister and a Priest, are all sitting at the bar on the Titanic... "
"Joselia: Dr. Crane, the Bishop "
"Frasier: Oh, well, I heard the story with a priest, but what the heck, a bishop's even funnier. Thank you, Sister. Okay, then, a Rabbi, a Minister and a Bishop are all sitting at the bar when the Purser rushes in to give them the horrible news. "
"Roz: Frasier, the Bishop is lost at sea "
"Frasier: Hey, look, are you telling this story or am I? "
"Roz: Frasier... "
"Frasier: Come on, lady, I work alone All right, hey, thank you. "
"Frasier: All right, anyway, so the Purser rushes in to give them the horrible news about the boat. So, the Rabbi gets up and says, 'My God, my people will need me.' The Minister's about to leave when the Priest said - oops, oh, sorry - the Bishop says, 'Sit down, relax, have another drink. I'm sure that the Rabbi can handle it.” And the Minister says, 'My God, man How can you abandon your flock when we've just hit an iceberg?' And the Bishop says, 'An iceberg? I thought he said we had no ice aboard' "
"Frasier: Hello? Is this thing on? [imitating Johnny Carson] Whoa Bomb-o "

"Martin: All right, now. Quiet, it's getting ready to start. "
"Announcer: The following is a paid political announcement for Holden Thorpe. "
"Niles: You dragged us over here to see a commercial for Holden Thorpe? "
"Martin: Shh "
"Frasier: The man is a fascist. He's like Himmler without the whimsy. "
"Announcer: And now another American for Holden Thorpe. "
"Martin: Hi, I'm Marty Crane. "
"Frasier: Oh, dear God. "
"Martin: For thirty years I was a cop walking The beat in Seattle. Then my hip was shattered by an assassin's bullet - an assassin who wouldn't have been on the streets if it weren't for those bleeding hearts we sent to Congress. "
"Martin: I used to carry a gun. Now I carry a cane. I'm voting to elect Holden Thorpe. He's running because I can't. "
"Martin: Well? "
"Daphne: Oh, Mr. Crane, I don't know what to say. I'm in a state of shock. "
"Niles: Aren't we all? "
"Daphne: I mean, you were wonderful This calls for a celebration. What'll you have? "
"Martin: Oh, give me a beer. "
"Frasier: Dad... how did this happen? "
"Martin: Well, I took a walk to the park last week and they were having a rally for Thorpe. So I started to talk to one of his people and told him I was an ex-cop and the next thing you know they were shoving a camera in my face. "
"Frasier: This is appalling. Those people are exploiting you. "
"Martin: No, they're not. I like Thorpe. "
"Niles: Oh, how could you support that odious little hosehead? I once heard him say, 'Cancer aside, tobacco is good for the economy.' "
"Martin: Well, I like him. He's gonna put more cops on the street. "
"Daphne: Yeah, well, it couldn't hurt. Now that everyone and his brother's walking around armed. Makes me glad we don't have so many guns in England. "
"Frasier: You don't need guns, you've got kidney pie. [The phone rings] Hello? It's Duke. "
"Martin: Oh "
"Niles: Sherry? "
"Frasier: I couldn't possibly, Niles. I'm too upset. "
"Martin: Oh yeah, yeah. I'm glad you liked it, Duke. Yeah, it was fun. Hey, I got a lot of showbiz secrets to tell you. You know they can make you cry on cue by pulling a hair out of your nose? What? Really? Oh, guys, quick, over here- channel 14, they're running my other spot Hey, Duke, this one was my idea. Remember when Lyndon Johnson lifted up his shirt to show his scar? "
"Martin: Hi, I'm Marty Crane. Crime isn't pretty. And if you don't believe me, look at this "
"Waitress: Can I help you, sir? "
"Frasier: Yes, what are your specials today? "
"Waitress: Kenyan blend. "
"Frasier: No, no, no, no. Still poaching elephants over there. Got something else? "
"Waitress: Dark roast Brazilian. "
"Frasier: Not until they do something about the loss of our rainforests. "
"Waitress: Salvadoran? "
"Frasier: No, I've never forgiven them for their human rights violations. "
"Waitress: Well, then we're down to the Hawaiian Kona blend. Or, have they slaughtered too many macadamia nuts? "
"Frasier: That'll be fine, thank you. "
"Frasier: Niles. "
"Niles: Frasier, I can't stand it. I just walked by an electronics store and there in the window were twenty-two television sets and on every screen was Dad's... ...butt. "
"Frasier: I saw it. I don't know which is worse - seeing his butt, or what it stands for. I just can't believe that our father is actually endorsing that self-serving fearmonger. "
"Niles: I've been giving this a lot of thought. And I realized Dad isn't the problem. He's just supporting the candidate of his choice. The problem lies with us. "
"Frasier: Us? We haven't done anything. "
"Niles: Exactly. 'The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.' "
"Frasier: Edmund Burke. "
"Niles: I have that quotation in a frame. I keep meaning to put it up in my office but I never seem to get around to it. [the waitress brings Frasier's coffee] Anyway, Frasier, I think the time has come for you and me to get involved. "
"Frasier: What are you suggesting? "
"Niles: I propose we throw our support behind Thorpe's opponent, Phil Patterson. "
"Frasier: Well, of course I intend to vote for Patterson. "
"Niles: I had something a little more ambitious in mind. I spoke to some people down at Patterson's headquarters this morning, and your name came up. They'd like you to film a TV spot endorsing their candidate. "
"Frasier: Niles, listen. I'd really love to help, but surely you must realize that as a radio psychiatrist, I can't take a chance of alienating my listeners. The people that need my help might be reluctant to call in if they knew my political views. "
"Niles: Well, I wish you'd at least think about it. A candidate like this doesn't come along that often. He's hard-working. He volunteers weekends at a soup kitchen. He really cares about people. Finally, a politician who believes in the things we believe in. "
"Boy: Buy a box of chocolate - send a kid to camp? "
"Niles: Excuse me, can't you see we're talking here? "
"Frasier: Thank you for your call, Susan. We'll be right back after this message. "
"Thorpe: Crime - it's epidemic. It strikes fast and it can strike you. I'm Holden Thorpe. You should send me to Washington because... "
"Frasier: It's better than having you here "
"Roz: Piece of work, isn't he? He makes it sound like it's either vote for him or be found murdered in your bed. "
"Frasier: Oh, I wouldn't be concerned if I were you, Roz. What are the chances of finding you there alone? "
"Bulldog: Hey, sports fan, how they hangin'? "
"Frasier: Okay, Bulldog. "
"Bulldog: I was talking to Roz. "
"Roz: Ten seconds. "
"Thorpe: So vote for me. My crime program will give the streets back to the people- "
"Frasier: That's good. Because with your tax program, that's where they'll be sleeping Welcome back, Seattle. We'll be back for just one more phone call after this news break. And then next up, Bob 'Bulldog' Briscoe- and the Gonzo Sports Show. I've asked you not to do that "
"Bulldog: Way to be impartial, Doc. You know, I happen to think Thorpe's a good man. Who you voting for, that pretty boy Phil Patterson? "
"Roz: Yeah, Patterson's great. His reapportionment plan makes a lot of sense. "
"Frasier: Forget it, Roz. He's happily married. "
"Bulldog: Yeah, so's Thorpe. Go figure. His wife's a cow and he still loves her. "
"Frasier: There's a bumper sticker. "
"Bulldog: Be back in a minute. "
"Roz: Hey, I liked that little shot you took at Thorpe. Although our next caller doesn't seem to share your opinion. "
"Frasier: Oh, really? Well, put him on. I welcome contrasting viewpoints. Hello, Seattle, we're back. Roz, who do we have on the line? "
"Roz: On line one we have Holden Thorpe. "
"Roz: Go ahead, caller. "
"Thorpe: Crane, Thorpe. Let me ask you something. Are you married? "
"Frasier: Divorced. "
"Thorpe: You ever serve in the military? "
"Frasier: Well, actually, I have congenitally weak ankles, it's a family problem. "
"Thorpe: I see, I see. So a guy like you - unmarried, didn't serve his country - sees fit to criticize a patriotic family man who fought in the Battle of Grenada. I went in on the first wave, by the way. "
"Frasier: On a surfboard, I suppose? "
"Thorpe: If you ask me, the day we get the likes of you off the radio will be the day America will be a nice, friendly place to live again. "
"Frasier: All right, you've said your piece, now you're gonna listen to mine Hang up on me, will you? Well, all right, even though you may not be listening, the people of Seattle are gonna hear what I have to say "
"Roz: No, they won't. The show ended five seconds ago, I had to send it to traffic. "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Oh, hello there. I'm Dr. Frasier Crane. Many of you know me from my radio show, but today I'm speaking to you as a concerned citizen. As a mental health expert, I've been listening to what my good friend Phil Patterson has to say. I like the way his mind works. He's a visionary, and he cares about the little people. That's why I'm proud to say that I'm behind Phil Patterson for Congress. "
"Phil: Thanks, Frasier. Together, we can live the dream. "
"Frasier: Phil "
"Patterson: the sane choice. "
"Director: Okay, guys. Give us about five minutes to adjust the lights and then we'll shoot it. "
"Frasier: Great. "
"Niles: Yes, yes, adjust those lights. They need to be, uh, lighter and... you know, brighter. "
"Phil: Thanks again, Frasier. "
"Niles: Oh, our pleasure, Phil. The Crane family has a long history of political involvement. You know, my wife Maris actually has all our servants down at your campaign headquarters licking envelopes. She'd do it herself, but the poor thing can't produce saliva. "
"Daphne: Hello, there. "
"Frasier: Oh, Daphne... I thought we agreed you'd keep him out of here for two hours. "
"Daphne: Well, I walked him around the park, but you know how he gets. He starts whining and whimpering until you can't stand it any longer. "
"Phil: Oh, don't let them talk about you like that, little fella. "
"Martin: She was talking about me. Hi, Marty Crane. "
"Phil: Phil Patterson. You look familiar, Mr. Crane, but I can't quite place you. "
"Martin: Oh, let me give you a hint. "
"Frasier: Dad "
"Martin: Just trying to help the guy "
"Frasier: My father did a commercial for your opponent. "
"Phil: Yes, it came back to me. "
"Daphne: Hello, Daphne Moon. "
"Phil: Hi. "
"Daphne: You know, my uncle was a political writer for one of those London tabloids. I can still remember his biggest scoop. The headline "
"read: 'High-ranking politician caught wearing women's clothing.' Of course, you turn to page two and you found out it was Margaret Thatcher, but by then you'd already bought the paper. "
"Phil: Well, thank you, Miss Moon. "
"Frasier: Say, Phil, it's getting a little hot in here. You want to step out on to the balcony with me, get a little fresh air? "
"Phil: Great. Oh, beautiful view. "
"Frasier: Thank you. Yes, you know, I feel very lucky living here. I'd like to say I feel lucky to be a part of your campaign as well. "
"Phil: Oh, it's me who's lucky. It's quite a boost for an underdog to get an endorsement from Frasier Crane. "
"Frasier: Oh, I don't know if my name carries that much weight. "
"Phil: Oh, come on, people love you. I've listened to your show. To tell the truth, I've even thought of calling in. "
"Frasier: Really? What for? "
"Phil: Oh, it's... kind of sensitive. "
"Frasier: Listen, Phil, as a psychiatrist, anything you tell me will be kept in the strictest confidence. "
"Frasier: You know, it's funny how the more you bottle things up inside, the bigger they seem to be. "
"Phil: Well, I've never told anybody this before, but... okay, here goes. Six years ago... I was abducted by aliens. "
"Frasier: Aliens? "
"Phil: They transported me up to their spaceship for a kind of conference. They're very concerned about what we're doing to our planet. Hey, you were right. Now that I've said it out loud, it doesn't seem like that big a deal. "
"Frasier: No... "
"Niles: They're ready for you, gentlemen. Come on in here and let's elect a Congressman "
"Niles: Frasier? [He gestures for Frasier to come in, but he doesn't move] Frasier? "
"Director: We're rolling. And... action. "
"Frasier: Hello, I'm Dr. Frasier Crane. Many of you know me from my radio show but today I'm speaking to you as a concerned citizen... a deeply concerned citizen. "
"Frasier: As a mental health expert, I've been listening to what my good friend Phil Patterson has to say. I like the way his mind works. He's a visionary, and he cares about... ...the little people. "
"Frasier: That's why I'm proud to say that I'm behind Phil Patterson for Congress. "
"Phil: Thanks, Frasier. Together, we can live the dream. "
"Frasier: Phil "
"Patterson: The sane choice. "
"Director: Okay, cut it "
"Frasier: God, I'm burning up "
"Director: Frasier, you were a little nervous on that one. Why don't you take a couple of minutes and we'll try it again. "
"Martin: I got mine on the first take. "
"Niles: Frasier, may I see you in the kitchen? "
"Niles: What's going on in there? You look like a zombie "
"Frasier: Oh God, Niles I've got something I'd really like to get off my chest. But if I told you I'd be violating a doctor-patient confidence. "
"Niles: Oh, I see. Well, nothing is more sacrosanct than our professional ethics. Fortunately, I know a trick to get around them. For the next few minutes, I'll be your psychiatrist, and then you can spill your guts with impunity. "
"Frasier: Well, it's borderline, but I'm desperate "
"Niles: All right. "
"Frasier: Just now, on the balcony, Phil Patterson told me that he had been... abducted by aliens. Apparently, he was beamed up to the mother ship, for a little interplanetary chitchat "
"Niles: This is bad, isn't it? "
"Frasier: Niles, this is incredible. It's just awful. We're gonna look like such idiots "
"Niles: We? The whole thing was your idea. I knew I should never have let you get me into politics "
"Frasier: My idea? "
"Frasier: Oh my God, Niles, stop it This isn't getting us anywhere "
"Niles: All right, what are we going to do? "
"Frasier: Well, I think we have to convince Phil to drop out of the race and seek professional help. "
"Niles: If Phil drops out, then Thorpe will win. "
"Frasier: Forget it, Niles "
"Niles: Well, then you can forget education, and the environment, and funding for the arts... "
"Frasier: Are you saying I should still back Phil? "
"Niles: All right. Answer me "
"this: can you tell me with any certainty that in such a vast universe there isn't intelligent life on other planets? "
"Frasier: At the moment, I'm not sure there's intelligent life in this kitchen "
"Niles: All right, all right, all right. Let's assume that it's in his imagination. How often does he see these aliens? "
"Frasier: Well, it's only happened the one time. "
"Frasier: Which might suggest that it was an isolated incident brought on by overwork rather than a pattern of paranoid delusion. "
"Niles: My diagnosis exactly "
"Frasier: Phil has worked hard. "
"Niles: Yes. "
"Frasier: He deserves his chance. "
"Niles: Yes. "
"Frasier: He's still gotta seek professional help. "
"Niles: Yes The best there is. But we're not going to turn our backs on him three weeks before the election. "
"Frasier: No, damn it, we are not. So, will you treat him? "
"Niles: Are you kidding? I'm a doctor, not a miracle worker "
"TO: "
"Roz: I think it's time I get my eyebrows waxed. I'm starting to get that Romanian peasant look again. Of course, it doesn't help that I didn't get any sleep last night. "
"Frasier: Dating a snorer? "
"Roz: You know, Frasier, I'm getting just a little tired of your constant insinuation that I sleep around. I didn't get any sleep because of that idiot Chopper Dave. When he gets bored doing traffic reports he likes to buzz people's apartments in his helicopter. "
"Frasier: Oh, I can see how that would be annoying. "
"Roz: Well, it didn't bother me much, but the guy I was with is a Vietnam vet and he started having flashbacks. "
"Bulldog: Greetings, losers Have you heard the great news? "
"Frasier: What, one of your overpaid idols passed his urine test? "
"Bulldog: Yeah, laugh all you can. Word's out about your pal Patterson and those aliens of his. "
"Frasier: Oh, my God "
"Roz: What aliens? "
"Bulldog: It's all over TV "
"Frasier: How did they find out? "
"Bulldog: What, are you kidding? You can't keep something like this quiet. Every station in town is serving his bleeding heart up on a platter. "
"Frasier: Isn't that just like the media? The day before the election they find one tiny flaw in a man and they try to ruin his career Well, you know what? I have my own conduit to the public's ear. I'm not letting Phil go down without a fight "
"Roz: What aliens? "
"Bulldog: Turns out Patterson's got a couple of illegal aliens from Guatemala working in his house. No greencards, no documents, no chance "
"Frasier: Hello, Seattle. I'm back. This is Dr. Frasier Crane and I have just learned during the commercial break that it has become public knowledge that Phil Patterson, candidate for Congress, believes in aliens from outer space. "
"Frasier: Not only does he believe in them, he believes he has met with them. That he was beamed aboard their spaceship for a little interplanetary tête-à-tête. [Roz shakes her head at him to stop] Shocked? Well, all right. [Roz knocks on the glass, he ignores her] But I say, let's ask ourselves these questions. Has this... "
"Frasier: ...harmless delusion, most likely brought on by overwork and sleep deprivation, adversely affected his voting record in any way? I ask you, and I say no. What great leader doesn't have his quirks? Ronald Reagan saw an astrologist. General Patton believed in reincarnation. Even J. Edgar Hoover let his slip show once in a while "
"Frasier: People, we're talking about a great leader here We shouldn't concern ourselves with these minor eccentricities. What's important - what really counts - is what's in here... I'm pointing at my chest now. "
"TO: "
"Announcer: The results from the last precinct are in. Holden Thorpe has been elected to Congress, garnering a whopping ninety- two percent of the vote. "
"Daphne: Well, at least Mr. Patterson got eight percent. "
"Martin: Yeah, well, they must have been counting absentee votes from the planet Krypton "
"Daphne: Oh, come on now, Dr. Crane. It wasn't all your fault. I'm sure having those Guatemalans in his home would have cost him some votes anyway. "
"Frasier: Those Guatemalans were exchange students Phil was giving them free room and board as a goodwill gesture between countries. "
"Martin: Well, I'd like to stay here and gloat, but I gotta get changed to go to the big celebration down at Thorpe headquarters. Hey, you're welcome to tag along if you'd like. You're quite a hero down there "
"Frasier: No, thank you. Stupid, stupid, stupid When will I learn it hurts when I do that? "
"Frasier: Oh, Phil. Come on in. "
"Phil: Hi Frasier. Thank you. I just came by to return this good- luck tie you loaned me. "
"Frasier: Yes, well, I saw you wearing it on television when you made your concession speech. "
"Phil: It was a little embarrassing having to do it before lunch. But it gave me some time to run some errands and pick up my dry cleaning. "
"Frasier: Phil, I am so sorry about the misunderstanding... "
"Phil: Oh, it's okay. I know you didn't do it on purpose. You thought you were defending me. "
"Frasier: The people of Seattle deserve something better than Holden Thorpe. "
"Phil: That's politics. And it's just one election. I'll be back. "
"Frasier: You really think you can? "
"Phil: Maybe I'm a dreamer, but I like to believe anything's possible. "
"Frasier: Phil? I've gotta ask you... do you really believe it happened? "
"Phil: I honestly wish I could say it didn't, but it did. I guess you'll never believe it unless it happens to you. "
"Frasier: So, what's next for you? "
"Phil: Maybe I'll run in California. A thing like this could actually help me there. "
"Frasier: Anything's possible... "
"Frasier: Oh, very funny, Chopper Dave "

"Frasier: Hi, we're back. Roz tells me we have Chester on the line. Hello, Chester. How can I help you? "
"Chester: I don't know. I've had a lot of fights with my wife lately. She feels I'm just wasting my life, standing still— "
"Frasier: Spinning your wheels? "
"Chester: Huh? I don't follow. "
"Frasier: Chester, I'm afraid this problem might be just a little too complex for the few seconds we have remaining. Uh, why don't you try to call us back tomorrow, I'll make sure that you get on first thing. "
"Chester: Gee, it's awful tough to get through. "
"Frasier: Well, I'll tell you what, hang tight and when I get off the air I'll pick up and try to help you then. "
"Chester: Take your time. "
"Frasier: O.K., everybody, I've got to scoot. Bulldog's up next after the news with the Gonzo Sports Show. Today's "
"topic: What's wrong with our Seattle Mariners? If you haven't had a chance to voice your opinion on that in the last eighteen years, you'll want to today So long, all. "
"Frasier: Well, Roz, that was a pretty good show "
"Roz: Mmm-hmm. "
"Frasier: Well, what are you reading so intently? "
"Roz: Oh, it's, uh, 'Seattle' magazine, it's their 'up-and-comers' issue — the hottest hundred men and women in town. "
"Frasier: Oh, let me see. "
"Roz: Don't you want to finish up with Chester? "
"Frasier: Oh, you heard him, he can wait. "
"Roz: If you're looking for yourself, you're not in there. "
"Frasier: Oh. "
"Roz: And your brother Niles isn't in there either. "
"Frasier: Cool Oh, my. Who is this fresh angel? Madeline Marshall, #47. "
"Roz: Ooh, manufactures her own line of sportswear "
"Frasier: God, she's a stunning woman. 'Single, patron of the arts, MBA at Stanford' - well, if you have to go to school on the West Coast. Oh, oh, oh, and what she looks for most in a "
"man: 'someone who knows how to... listen.' Roz, I'm in love "
"Roz: Well, why don't you call her up and ask her out? "
"Frasier: Oh yeah, right. "
"Roz: Well, I'm serious, Frasier What have you got to lose? "
"Frasier: I couldn't just call her out of the blue She doesn't even know who I am "
"Roz: You're on the radio, a lot of people know who you are. "
"Frasier: Yes, well then why am I not in this magazine? "
"Roz: Because those are important people. Come on, I'll gonna call her up. "
"Frasier: Oh, no, no "
"Bulldog: Hey, doc "
"Frasier: Bulldog. "
"Bulldog: Just got back from the gym Did an hour on the Stairmaster What do you think? Like a couple of little cherry tomatoes, huh? "
"Frasier: Thank you, Bulldog, you've just put me off salads for a month. "
"Bulldog: Hey, what have we got here? "
"Roz: Hello, is Madeline Marshall there? Dr. Frasier Crane. "
"Bulldog: Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute This Madeline Marshall, you know her? "
"Frasier: Well, no, no, I found her attractive, and Roz insisted on calling her. "
"Bulldog: Wow, small "
"wonder: smart, sophisticated, and I like a woman who doesn't wear underwear. "
"Frasier: She's wearing a business suit. "
"Bulldog: That was a general comment. "
"Roz: Hi, Miss Marshall? Could you please hold for Dr. Crane? Thank you. "
"Frasier: Oh, all right. 'Once more unto the breach.' [picks up and punches line one] Hello, this is Dr. Frasier Crane. I know we've never met, but you know, from everything I know about you, you just seem like the most fascinating person. I was just wondering if — well, why don't I just come out and say it? Would you be so good as to have dinner with me tonight? Oh well, well, that's very gracious of you to accept, Chester, but I didn't mean you. Roz, you could have told me Madeline was on line two "
"Roz: You could have asked. "
"Daphne: Mr. Crane, is the proper term 'serial killer' or 'serial murderer?' "
"Martin: Serial killer, why? "
"Daphne: Oh, just letting my old mum know what's going on in Seattle. She worries when she doesn't hear from me. "
"Martin: Hey Niles, how about a nice Havana to go with that wine? "
"Niles: Thank you Aren't Cuban cigars illegal? "
"Martin: Yeah, I got a friend in Customs over at Sea-Tac. He confiscated them from some high school teacher who claimed he was bringing them into the country for a civics lesson I mean, when are people going to learn? Rules are only rules when they apply to everyone "
"Daphne: Oh, I love to see a man with a cigar. [Niles turns toward her, leaving Martin hanging] It reminds me of my grandfather. Morning to night, he used to sit with a great big stogie dangling from his lips. Oh, the hours we kids used to spend sitting on his lap, playing with the yellow whiskers beneath his nose. Then he'd take out his teeth with the cigar still in them and chase us around the room We'd all laugh and laugh... then suddenly Grampa's mood would change and we'd all have to run for our lives. You can't buy memories like that. "
"Frasier: Damn it Eddie, I know you took the socks that go with this suit. Now where are they? "
"Frasier: Brown socks with a blue suit? I think not, try again. Thank you. "
"Niles: And where are you off to? "
"Daphne: Dr. Crane has a blind date tonight. "
"Niles: Really, with who? "
"Frasier: Madeline Marshall. She has her own sportswear concern, and according to 'Seattle' magazine, she is the forty-seventh hottest person in Seattle. "
"Niles: That article was a sham. "
"Martin: Not in it, huh? "
"Niles: Can you believe it? "
"Frasier: Yes, well, I'm off You know, I have a good feeling about tonight. I have a song in my heart, a little dance in my step, and dog saliva around my ankles "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Thank you. "
"Madeline: This is wonderful I've never even heard of this place. "
"Frasier: Oh well, my goodness, you're in for a treat. Degas is the pinnacle of French country dining. It's just Etienne Degas, his wife and daughter, and they'll treat us as if we were family. Well, you know, I couldn't help being flattered when you told me that you knew my show. Can I count you among my devoted listeners? "
"Madeline: Well, actually my secretary listens to it — but I try to catch as much as I can when I cross back and forth through her office. "
"Etienne: Bonsoir, monsieur, madame, and welcome to Degas. Our special tonight is our fabulous crispy duck "
"Frasier: Oh, yummy. And to start off we'll have a bottle of the Chateau Neuf du Pape '89. "
"Madeline: Ah, the only one in that decade to outdo the '88. That's the one to get "
"Etienne: Ah, excellent choice ' fist at Frasier, regarding "
"Frasier: You know wine. "
"Madeline: Well, I try to make it a point to acquaint myself with the finer things in life. "
"Frasier: Oh well, what would you like to know about me? "
"Madeline: Well, for starters, why is a man as charming as you still out there? "
"Frasier: Well, actually, I... I'm recently divorced. "
"Madeline: Oh, thank goodness. For a second there I thought you were one of those strange single men still living with his parents "
"Frasier: Yeah, yeah, your heart really has to go out to those sad sacks. "
"Madeline: I'm divorced also. "
"Frasier: Oh well, we have so much in common. "
"Madeline: I caught him cheating with my sister. "
"Frasier: Fabulous The same thing happened to me. "
"Madeline: Boy, my sister gets around "
"Frasier: It's good to see that you've still kept your sense of humor. "
"Madeline: Yeah, but it isn't easy to get over something like that, is it? "
"Frasier: No... no, it's not. Those nights when you ask yourself how could this have happened? Was I insensitive to her needs? "
"Madeline: Was I too devoted to my work? "
"Frasier: Was I simply not good enough in bed? You'll reach for anything "
"Etienne: Qu’est-ce que tu me racontes, alors? "
"Yvette: No, Papa "
"Etienne: What are you telling me, you are pregnant? "
"Degas: Keep your voice down "
"Yvette: I told you, Mama I told you he would be like this "
"Etienne: Who is the father? I want to know "
"Etienne: Who is the father? "
"Yvette: I won't tell you "
"Etienne: Ha, ha, ha When I find this man, I will kill him And snap his neck like a stale baguette "
"Etienne: Monsieur, Madame, your wine. "
"Frasier: Yes, that's the one. "
"Etienne: Bon, bon, bon, I will just go and open it. Ah, this will be a night to remember, non? "
"Frasier: Oh, yes "
"Etienne: Are you going to tell me? "
"Yvette: No, no "
"Frasier: You know, there's a clam house up the road that has a late seating... "
"Madeline: Oh no, I think we're getting the most bang for our entertainment buck right here. "
"kitchen: "
"Degas: Oh, thirty-five years of marriage, what did I ever see in you? "
"Etienne: Ah, you don't think I am sick of you? You and your cuttlefish bisque I spit in your cuttlefish bisque "
"Etienne: Voila, monsieur, madame – it’s a delicacy from our little village in "
"France: cuttlefish bisque. "
"Madeline: What are the odds? I had cuttlefish for lunch. "
"kitchen: "
"Etienne: Ah, no, no, no, you don’t have to You can leave my house, Yvette No, no, no, go, go to wherever he is "
"Degas: Pardon, monsieur, are you not the one who gives advice on the radio? "
"Frasier: You listen to my show? "
"Degas: No, but my sous-chef does, and I hear you when I walk back and forth through the kitchen. Monsieur, you must help me. Etienne "
"Frasier: No, no, listen, if-if everyone comes out here, how will you know when our duck is crispy? "
"Degas: Etienne, this is the doctor from the radio, eh? "
"Etienne: Ah, oui, oui, oui "
"Degas: Please, monsieur, you must talk to my husband. My daughter is with child, and he does not understand that these things happen "
"Etienne: Don't talk to me, talk to this tramp Do you believe my daughter, madame? "
"Madeline: You should meet my sister. "
"Degas: As if I wasn't pregnant when we got married, eh? "
"Etienne: Oh, I wish I had been killed in the war "
"Degas: Oh, it's hard to get killed when you run the other way "
"Frasier: All right, silence Silence Both of you just try to calm down. I'll see what I can do. Monsieur Degas, you are angry now. That is a temporary emotion. You are devastated because you think the bond between a father and a daughter has been broken. She is no longer your little girl. But that's not possible. That bond cannot be broken — not even by that young man cowering there in the corner who is so obviously the father. "
"Frasier: Come out. Come out, it's all right. We need more water "
"Etienne: You? You can't even get water in a glass [motions to Yvette] How did you do this? "
"Frasier: Monsieur Degas, please — hold your daughter in your arms and tell her how you really feel. "
"Etienne: Yvette... ah, Yvette, Yvette, ma petite, I love you... "
"Degas: Thank you, monsieur, thank you You are a god [to Madeline] And you, mademoiselle, are very lucky. "
"Madeline: I'm starting to realize that. "
"Frasier: Just another evening out... with Dr. Frasier Crane. "
"Frasier: Hi, Roz "
"Roz: Hey, Frasier. "
"Frasier: Again, thank you. "
"Roz: It's O.K., Frasier, you've thanked me every day for the last two weeks. "
"Frasier: Yes, yes, but if it hadn't been for you, I never would have met... Madeline. It's just — you know, we went out again last night, and it's just perfect between us We talk, we can laugh at the same— "
"Roz: Just stop. Did it ever occur to you that since I'm in one of the worst dating droughts of my entire adult life, that to hear you prattling on like a giggling schoolgirl about your storybook romance might be the teensiest bit irritating? "
"Frasier: No, it hadn't, and you're right, Roz. I'm sorry, sometimes I can be so insensitive. But, you know, Madeline's helping me with that, she is so good, she is so good, in, like, every way ” and batters her clipboard against her forehead. "
"Frasier: All right, I’m sorry. It's just that I haven't felt this way since, since my divorce. Everything seems so right. You know, I haven't said this out loud, but here "
"goes: it's possible that she could be the woman I spend the rest of my life with. "
"Roz: Go. Go do that. Get married, have a couple of kids, move out to the country, buy a puppy, live happily ever after Just don't tell me about it, I need a boyfriend "
"Frasier: Dear Roz. Dear, silly Roz. Dear, silly, horny Roz. "
"Frasier: Oh, oh, look It's— "
"Roz: That must be Madeline "
"Frasier: Yes "
"Frasier: Oh, God, what a surprise to see you. "
"Madeline: Well, I hope you don't mind me stopping by, but I have a meeting with a buyer across the street in ten minutes, and there's something that I wanted to talk to you about. "
"Frasier: Oh well, here, please, have a seat. "
"Madeline: Well, you know when we first started going out, we both agreed we didn't want to rush into the physical part, that we'd save ourselves for the right moment. "
"Frasier: It's now? "
"Madeline: No, actually, uh, I was wondering what you thought about us going away for the weekend — just the two of us. "
"Frasier: Well, uh... I'd miss my favorite shows, but sure. "
"Madeline: I was thinking, two-three days... "
"Frasier: I was thinking more like a week. "
"Madeline: O.K., now for the really big "
"question: When? "
"Frasier: Well, the minute we get there. "
"Madeline: No, actually, I meant when do we go? "
"Frasier: Oh, oh, let's see. "
"Madeline: Now, let's see, I am good for the week of the sixteenth. "
"Frasier: The, uh, sixteenth — oh, no, sweeps week. How about the twenty-third? "
"Madeline: Uh, no — trade show. Uh, thirtieth? "
"Frasier: No. "
"Madeline: That puts us into the next month. No, no — uh, the twentieth? "
"Frasier: No. "
"Madeline: Well, this was a great idea, but we're both obviously too busy. We'll do it another time. I got to run. "
"Frasier: O.K. "
"Frasier: Let's go tomorrow. "
"Madeline: You're on. "
"Frasier: I know the perfect place — Bora Bora "
"Madeline: Hubba Hubba "
"Frasier: I'll make the arrangements. "
"Madeline: I'll meet you at the airport. "
"Frasier: O.K. "
"Madeline: O.K. Bye. "
"Frasier: Bye. Oh, oh, Madeline— "
"Madeline: Bye. "
"Roz: Hello, you don't know me, but I saw your picture in 'Seattle' magazine... "
"TO: "
"Martin: Ah, they don't write songs like that anymore. "
"Niles: This is really what 'men' do, isn't it, Dad? "
"Martin: Yeah. This, and some things outdoors, but we'll just stick to this for now. "
"Niles: You know, these last few nights have been very pleasant, Dad. You and me, sitting together, appreciating these fine cigars. Who would have thought a simple Cuban peasant somewhere in the Sierra Maestra would bring a father and son closer together? "
"Martin: Yeah. Must make that dime he gets for a whole day’s work a lot more satisfying. "
"Daphne: I'm going to miss these little sweethearts. "
"Martin: Ooh, now there's a talent. "
"Niles: I'll say. Just how do you do that? "
"Daphne: Oh, it's really very simple. Let me show you, it's all in the tongue. [pulls him close and purses his lips with her fingers] That's right, just purse your lips and pucker up like a little goldfish. Just like that, you got it. "
"Frasier: Niles, what are you doing? "
"Niles: I'm learning how to blow smoke. "
"Frasier: Where? Dad, I thought I asked you to smoke those things out on the balcony. "
"Martin: It's cold out there. "
"Frasier: Fine, all right. Maybe an errant ash will flick off and ignite your easy chair. "
"Martin: You're in a fine mood. What's the matter with you? "
"Frasier: Madeline and I are going to Bora Bora tomorrow. "
"Martin: Why do bad things happen to good people? "
"Niles: When did this come about? "
"Frasier: Just about an hour ago, when Madeline came down to the station. We got caught up in a moment of passion, before I know it I'm going halfway around the world with a woman I hardly even know It just isn't like me, I guess I'm getting caught up in the romance. "
"Daphne: Well, I'm not sure about the psychological ramifications of this, but it seems like a good thing to me. "
"Frasier: Yes, well, to the untrained eye, yes, but what if we hate each other? End up being stuck together for a week "
"Daphne: Oh, that won't happen. If anything, you'll come back even more in love than ever. "
"Frasier: Even worse If it goes perfectly, then it means we'll start talking about a serious commitment, then living together and then marriage, and... "
"Niles: If you ask me, Frasier, your trepidation is well-founded. It is possible to move a relationship along too fast, and ultimately marry too hastily. You could find, a few years down the line, that the person isn't really right for you, and then what happens if you meet the right person, someone who really excites you and makes you feel alive, but you can't act upon it because you're trapped in a stale, albeit comfortable Maris ...marriage. I have to go now. "
"Martin: Hey, let me ask you one question, "
"Frasier: did you feel a spark when you met this woman? "
"Frasier: Like fireworks. "
"Martin: Well, then go for it You know, these things don't happen that often. It's like when I met your mother, it was at a crime scene. Hester was a psychiatrist, so every now and again the department would have her run up a profile on a suspect. I remember the first time I met her — it was over the chalk outline of a murder victim. She drew a little smile on the head of the outline, and I drew a pair of eyes, and before you knew it we were laughing like a couple of kids. "
"Frasier: Dad, you're a ghoul. "
"Martin: I was joking. We couldn't draw on the outline, they hadn't moved the body yet. "
"Frasier: Yes, well, your corpse-strewn romance notwithstanding, I still feel just a little bit skittish about this whole thing. "
"Daphne: Well, Dr. Crane, if you'd like a feminine point of view — just shut your bloody cake hole and go I mean, look what happened when you took a chance and called this woman. You've been whistling a happy tune ever since. "
"Frasier: Well, that is true. "
"Martin: Yeah So make another bold move Do something to make yourself happy. "
"Daphne: Yeah, go on "
"Martin: Hey, you won't regret it "
"Frasier: Oh, all right, I'll do it "
"Martin: Attaboy That's great, that's terrific "
"Frasier: O.K., but don't think I don't know that you're mostly excited just to get me out of the house for a week "
"Martin: It will be sweet, won't it? "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Thank you. "
"Madeline: This is gorgeous, I'm so glad you suggested it. "
"Frasier: It's even more beautiful than I remember. You know what the natives say, they say that Bora Bora is the end of the world and the doorway to heaven. "
"Madeline: This could be the doorway to heaven for us. "
"Frasier: I'm certainly glad that you're the one that said that first. You know, I didn't want this to seem like our trip was just about sex, but... who are we kidding? "
"Madeline: I'm a little hot in these clothes, aren't you? "
"Frasier: I'm sweating like the pig that knows he's dinner "
"Madeline: I'll be right back. "
"Frasier: Oink "
"Madeline: Frasier... "
"Frasier: Oh, my God... "
"Lilith: Frasier? "
"Frasier: OH, MY GOD "

"Frasier: I just opened up the pages of 'Seattle' magazine, and there she was... "
"Frasier: So off I flew to Bora Bora, and did I receive the shock of my life... "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Lilith What are you doing here? "
"Lilith: I suppose I could ask you the same thing. "
"Madeline: Frasier, is everything all right? "
"Frasier: Uh, yes, yes. Uh, why don't you come out and join us, Madeline? What about you? Are you here with someone? "
"Lilith: Yes. Actually, he's snorkeling at the moment. "
"Frasier: Anyone I know? "
"Lilith: Sam Malone. "
"Frasier: Sam? "
"Lilith: Just kidding. "
"Frasier: Of all places, Lilith, why did you bring him here? "
"Lilith: Well, it was spectacular five years ago when you brought me, it's even more breathtaking now. "
"Frasier: But this was our place. How could you bring someone else? Oh, here. Lilith, I'd like you to meet Madeline Marshall. How's this for a hoot? This is my ex-wife, Lilith. "
"Madeline: Your... ex-wife is here? "
"Frasier: Yes. It's a shame, too — no papers to be signed. "
"Madeline: So you're here with someone? "
"Lilith: Why does everyone keep asking me that? Yes, I am. Oh, here he comes now. Brian? "
"Lilith: Dr. Brian Patchett, I'd like you to meet Madeline Marshall, and Dr. Frasier Crane. "
"Brian: Your ex-husband? You're making a joke "
"Lilith: No, God is. "
"Brian: Pleasure to meet you. "
"Frasier: Likewise. "
"Lilith: Uh, Brian is a seismologist at M.I.T. "
"Frasier: Oh well, that's perfect. Brian being a seismologist, and you having so many faults. [Lilith laughs, surprising Frasier] Lilith, you're laughing "
"Lilith: Well, I laugh quite a bit these days, thanks to Brian. "
"Frasier: Oh well, Madeline is just hilarious She also designs her own line of sportswear. "
"Lilith: I'm sorry, I don't think I've ever worn sportswear. "
"Madeline: So, how long are you going to stay? "
"Lilith: Until Tuesday. "
"Frasier: We're here till Wednesday. "
"Brian: Well, this certainly has the potential to be very awkward. Why don't we defuse the situation by getting together for cocktails later? "
"Madeline: Better yet, let's have dinner. "
"Lilith: Oh, that's a wonderful idea. Why don't we meet in the Tiki Room — at six o'clock? "
"Madeline: Great. "
"Frasier: Looking forward to it What a wonderful way to start out what promises to be the greatest week of our lives "
"Frasier: You see how Mr. Perfect kept rubbing it in, just to get my goat? "
"Madeline: Frasier, relax. "
"Frasier: Oh, like he had to climb that tree to get her a coconut — there were three of them on the ground "
"Madeline: Would you stop obsessing? Come here. "
"Frasier: O.K. "
"Frasier: Hold it What's that? "
"Madeline: What's what? "
"Frasier: Lilith is making love in there "
"Madeline: I don't hear a thing. "
"Frasier: Exactly "
"Madeline: Would you just concentrate on me, please? "
"Frasier: Oh, you're right, you're right. It's not like it was back in college, when that sort of thing was going on in the next room and I was left all alone with nothing but my dreams and my Henry Miller collection. You're right, I just got to block it out of my mind, just try to focus and concentrate on the task at hand "
"Madeline: Oh, that's sexy. "
"Frasier: You're right, forgive me. You want sexy? I'll show you sexy. "
"Madeline: I feel dirty. "
"Frasier: Good "
"Madeline: No, no, I mean sandy, from sitting on the beach. Just let me take a shower. "
"Frasier: O.K. Don't be long "
"Madeline: When I come back, I'll make you forget you were ever married to Lilith. "
"Frasier: That's never happened before without a prescription "
"Frasier: Oh yeah, oh yeah. [gets an idea and turns his head toward the wall; louder] Oh yeah... oh, it's never been like this before, never Nothing — damn her, she can give as good as she gets [starts jumping up and down on the bed] Oh yeah, oh yeah Oh, oh, mama Oh God, you are so hot I am burning up Oh, that's it, that's it Yes Yes "
"Frasier: Oh my God, yes Keep it up, baby You're killing me Oh God, you're an animal YES, YES "
"Madeline: Well, obviously you don't need me "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Well, before we go to our 'Eye in the Sky' Chopper Dave for the traffic report, I would like to send this confidential message to Madeline M. Madeline, I'm sure your gentleman would love an opportunity to explain his behavior, but you left the island before he had a chance, and, um, you won't return his calls or answer the notes he's sent. We all know how hard it is to find love in this world, what a tragedy it is to let it slip through our fingers. I think he really cares about you. This is Dr. Frasier Crane, we'll be back in a moment. "
"Roz: Frasier, you were wonderful. "
"Frasier: You really think she'll call? "
"Roz: If the woman doesn't respond, she doesn't have a heart. "
"Frasier: Thank you, Roz. "
"Roz: Oh, I almost forgot This bill came for you from your hotel in Bora Bora. "
"Frasier: Well, it's not too bad. I guess they had to charge me for the whole week. "
"Roz: No, that's for the bed you trashed. "
"Frasier: Twenty-five hundred dollars for bamboo? "
"Frasier: Hello, this is Dr. Frasier Crane. Roz, whom do we have next? "
"Roz: We have Vic from Seattle on line three. "
"Frasier: Hello, Vic. I'm listening. "
"Vic: Hi, Dr. Crane, thanks for taking my call. I'm a first-time caller, I'm a little nervous. "
"Frasier: Oh, just relax, Vic — 'I'm listening.' "
"Vic: Yeah, I'm really having a problem with women... "
"Roz: Frasier, Madeline's on line one "
"Vic: Dr. Crane? "
"Frasier: Oh, uh-uh, Vic, uh, something's come up in the booth, just- you know, I'll have to turn you over to my very capable producer. "
"Vic: Uh, O.K. NO, NO' Frasier ignores her and picks "
"Frasier: Madeline, Madeline, hi Oh, thanks for calling. Oh, no, no, it's OK, it's OK, I'm off the air right now. "
"Roz: So, Vic, uh, what's this trouble you're having with women? "
"Vic: I don't know. You know, I have a good job, I think I have a good personality. 'Course, I made more money when I was modeling, but I'm doing O.K. at the law firm. "
"Roz: Tell me more. "
"Niles: Maris will be thrilled you're coming to see her tonight in the ballet. "
"Daphne: Oh, we're delighted "
"Martin: Yeah. "
"Daphne: You know, when I was younger I dreamed of being a ballerina myself. "
"Niles: So did Maris But the poor thing could never get her weight up enough. That's why I couldn't help myself at the ballet fundraiser when they auctioned off this walk-on part. It was the perfect gift for my Maris "
"Martin: So Maris is gonna be a ballerina? "
"Niles: No. It's non-dancing, but it is a key role, Dad. She plays Ulrich, the hunchbacked drawbridge operator. "
"Martin: I hope we can pick her out. "
"Frasier: What are you people still doing here? "
"Daphne: Oh, hush, we'll be long gone before your lady friend gets here. "
"Frasier: Well, you don't want to be late for the ballet. "
"Martin: I do When those ballet guys start flying around in those tight pants, I don't know where to look "
"Daphne: Oh, that reminds me, I've got to bring my binoculars. "
"Frasier: Will you just get out of here? "
"Niles: Frasier, will you relax? "
"Frasier: I can't, it's my last chance with Madeline Serves me right, too, after the way I behaved in Bora Bora. "
"Niles: You're being too hard on yourself, it was just bad luck. How were you to know that Lilith had arrived on the island? "
"Martin: Aside from the seas starting to churn and all the birds taking flight from the trees. "
"Daphne: Oh now, don't you worry, Dr. Crane. Miss Marshall's going to forgive you. Women always appreciate a man who's sensitive enough to try again. That's why they call us the 'fair sex.' All right then, let's go see some leaping Russian stags "
"Martin: Oh hi, Maddy "
"Daphne: Oh, hello We were just leaving for the ballet. "
"Frasier: Madeline, come in. "
"Niles: You two kids take your time. Don't worry about us, we'll be out all evening. "
"Martin: Yeah, you know how it is. First the ballet, then the inevitable discussion. "
"Frasier: Well, that was a little awkward. "
"Madeline: So is this. "
"Frasier: I guess there's no delaying it. I might as well just launch into my little speech, try to explain why I behaved the way I did... "
"Madeline: You know what might be better? If I tell you how I've got it worked out. The minute you saw Lilith, you wanted to leave, but I wouldn't let you. You said you couldn't handle it, and by God, you were right You panicked, and your panic took a bad turn — a spectacularly bad turn. Anyway, that's how I've got it worked out in my head, and it's fragile, so let's not mess with it. So, why don't you mix up a pitcher of Mai- Tai's and give me a kiss? I'll let you guess which I want first. "
"Madeline: Guess again. "
"Madeline: Mmm, delicious I love mangoes. "
"Frasier: Well, we never got around to sampling this tropical delicacy while we were in the islands, so I thought we should do it now. "
"Madeline: Good thinking. "
"Frasier: You know, there's something else we never got around to in Bora Bora... "
"Madeline: Well, you got around to it. I just watched. "
"Frasier: Well, how about a little audience participation this time? "
"Madeline: Frasier, wait. I want this as much as you do, but there's something I need to talk to you about first. "
"Frasier: What? "
"Madeline: Well, I wasn't going to say anything. I-I thought I was comfortable with this and I wouldn't have to bring it up, but... well, I was involved with a divorced man once before, and just about the time that I was really falling for him... He reconciled with his ex-wife, and I'm telling you I just can't go through that again. "
"Frasier: It's all right, Madeline. Trust me, I assure you that Lilith and I are completely finished. She lives clear on the other side of the country. Except in matters of our son, we don't even have contact. "
"Madeline: That's all I wanted to hear. "
"Madeline: Well, what's your name, little fella? "
"Frasier: You promise you won't laugh? "
"Frasier: The dog? His name is Eddie. Come on. Pardon me while I put him back while he belongs. "
"Madeline: I'll be waiting. "
"Madeline: Oh God "
"Lilith: It's nice to see you too. Is Frasier here? "
"Madeline: Don't you live in Boston? "
"Lilith: I'm here on a layover — and judging by Frasier's trademark mangoes on a stick, so are you. If you like, I can come back in ten minutes. "
"Madeline: That won't be necessary. "
"Lilith: I apologize for coming at an inopportune moment, but Frasier and I have an agreement that we'll make time for each other if either one of us has something urgent to discuss — which I do. "
"Madeline: Take all the time you need. This whole thing's just a little too complicated for me. "
"Frasier: Put down that mango, my dear. It's time you tasted the forbidden fruit. YAAAHH Lilith What are you doing here? "
"Lilith: I have something urgent to discuss. "
"Frasier: What have you done with Madeline? "
"Lilith: She was surprised to see me and she left. "
"Lilith: I hope you're not angry with me. "
"Frasier: Angry? What do I have to be angry about? Just because every time I carve out the tiniest little slice of happiness for myself you come along and obliterate it? My God, woman, I'd drive a stake through your heart, but I don't think anything could kill you "
"Lilith: Brian asked me to marry him. "
"Frasier: What? "
"Lilith: He wants to stop in Las Vegas on our way home. "
"Frasier: You're getting married. "
"Lilith: Yes. "
"Frasier: Well... so am I "
"Lilith: Really? "
"Frasier: Yes, yes, to Madeline. "
"Lilith: Well, I just saw Madeline. She seemed in an awful hurry for someone who's getting married. "
"Frasier: She had to buy a dress... oh, God, what am I doing? I'm not getting married. "
"Lilith: Wow, you really had me going. Frasier, I don't want to disrupt anything. Really, I just came here hoping to get your blessing. "
"Frasier: I could have given you my blessing over the phone. "
"Lilith: Must you be so churlish? "
"Frasier: Well, I think I'm entitled I mean, the one comfort in being divorced is that you're both losers. Eventually, the time comes when one person is the first to move on. And quite frankly, I'd hoped it would be me. "
"Lilith: Well, I'd hoped it would be me. And it was But, I'd like to think that, had things worked out the other way around, I would have been happy for you. "
"Frasier: Well, if you love him, I am happy for you. "
"Lilith: I do. Brian has been a dutiful suitor for some time, and I'm convinced to within an acceptable margin of error that he loves me. "
"Frasier: Does Frederick like him? "
"Lilith: Oh, he's crazy about him. "
"Frasier: Oh... "
"Lilith: Oh, Frasier, Brian could never take your place that way. You're Frederick's father. "
"Frasier: Congratulations. "
"Daphne: Well, it looks like they made up "
"Martin: AAH "
"Frasier: Hello, everyone. "
"Niles: Lilith, what a pleasant surprise Well, how was Bora Bora? I've never seen you looking quite so tan. "
"Daphne: My God, what does she look like in winter? "
"Frasier: Everyone, we have some very happy "
"news: Lilith is going to be married again. "
"Martin: To who? "
"Frasier: Someone else. "
"Martin: Oh, that's great Congratulations Wonderful "
"Niles: Just wonderful, when's the happy occasion? "
"Lilith: Tomorrow, in Las Vegas. "
"Niles: Oh, Lilith, how delightfully kitschy It's your second marriage, so you've decided to poke fun at the institution by getting married in the tackiest place you could possible choose "
"Lilith: Brian's family lives in Las Vegas. "
"Niles: Well... isn't that convenient? You'll have someone to show you the museums. "
"Lilith: It was lovely seeing you all again. "
"Frasier: I'll just walk you out. "
"Lilith: Well, I hope you haven't found all this too unsettling. "
"Frasier: No, no. You know, I think it's actually good that you're getting remarried. I mean, otherwise we could have spent the rest of our lives wondering whether our divorce was a mistake, if we should have tried to work it out. Was it me, was it you, was it us, was it you? Now we can move on. "
"Lilith: What's next for you? "
"Frasier: I suppose I'll try to smooth things over with Madeline. "
"Lilith: Try very hard, Frasier. She seems worth it. "
"Frasier: Well, she'll need convincing. You know, I guess I could ask her back to Bora Bora with me, try again. You know, I'll lay on the whole package this time. I'll buy the airplane tickets first, pay for the hotel, get a limo, champagne and caviar, the whole nine yards. With any luck I'll sweep her off her feet and into my bed... I do own it, you know. "
"Lilith: Would you like to kiss the bride? "
"Frasier: It'd be my pleasure. "
"Lilith: You're really happy for me? "
"Frasier: Well, yes, of course. You'll understand, though, if I don't jump up and down and yell 'Yippee' "
"Lilith: Yes, I've already seen that. "
"TO: "
"Madeline: Now why don't we pick up where we left off, Frasier? "
"Frasier: Oh, my God... "
"Diane: Frasier? "
"Frasier: OH, MY GOD "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Oh God, I just had the most frightening dream Thank God I'm here with you. "
"Niles: Frasier, we have all week to analyze your dream. Right now, there's a huge bug in the shower "

"Frasier: Where have you been? We're on in two minutes "
"Roz: Forgive me, but I was busy preparing your schedule for tomorrow. You've got lunch with the station manager, you're recording a PSA at three o’clock and don't forget to send flowers to your sister-in-law at the hospital. "
"Frasier: Oh yes, Maris's face-lift "
"Roz: Really? I didn't know she needed one. "
"Frasier: Well, she doesn't, actually. There’s nothing wrong with Maris that wouldn't be cured by a little sun, some exercise and a personality. "
"Frasier: What are those? "
"Roz: Oh, just extra copies of your schedule. "
"Frasier: Why are you running down to the Xerox room for extra copies of my schedule? It wouldn't have anything to do with that new intern, would it? What's his name? "
"Roz: Eli. "
"Frasier: Roz, he's probably all of nineteen. "
"Roz: That's legal "
"Frasier: Well, coo-coo-ka-choo, Mrs. Robinson. "
"Roz: Frasier, the guy is so gorgeous, you just want to bite him all over, haven't you seen him? "
"Frasier: No, I've been eating out lately You're not seriously thinking of dating him, are you? "
"Roz: Why is it all right for older men to date younger women but it's not okay for older women to date younger men? "
"Frasier: I don't make the rules, Roz, I just enjoy them. "
"Roz: You're on. "
"Frasier: Hello, Seattle, this is Dr. Frasier Crane, KACL 780. We're with you for the next three hours so let's get straight to it. Roz, who's our first caller? "
"Roz: On line one we have Linda, she's calling from a car phone. "
"Frasier: Hello, Linda, I'm listening. "
"Linda: Oh, Dr. Crane. My husband and I are right in the middle of a fight. You see, we're on our way to the antique mart, we're obviously lost, but he refuses to stop and ask for directions. "
"Frasier: Yes, well, Linda, this is a common source of friction among couples. Some men feel the need to be in control, they see asking for help as a sign of weakness. "
"Linda: Oh, everybody knows that. Look, the reason I called is to ask how the hell do we get to the antique mart from Cherke Street and 14th Street. "
"Walter: I don't need any directions I know where I am "
"Linda: We're lost, Walter, face it, we're lost "
"Frasier: Well, this isn't normally the kind of advice I give, but let me see, I've lived in Seattle most of my life. Cherke and 14th, you would want to... "
"Roz: Dr. Crane, I've got a map right here. "
"Frasier: Oh, no thanks, Roz, I don't need any help GET MANILA ON THE PHONE "
"Martin: Hey, put that down That's disgusting, why do animals always drag these things into the house? "
"Frasier: Oh, dear God, what is it? A rat? "
"Martin: No, it's a stupid doll "
"Martin: He found it at the park and he carries it everywhere. "
"Martin: He never did this kind of stuff before you had him fixed "
"Niles: Hello, Frasier. "
"Frasier: I thought you'd be at the hospital with Maris. "
"Niles: I'm on my way down that now. Poor Maris, she's so worried, she hasn't had much hospital experience. Except the usual childhood things - you know, tonsils, adenoids, force-feeding. "
"Daphne: What's wrong with Mrs. Crane? "
"Niles: Oh, it's nothing serious. Cosmetic surgery. Her chin, her lips, her cheeks, her eyelids... "
"Martin: Maybe it would be faster if you just told us what she's leaving alone You know, if you want my opinion, this is just vanity "
"Frasier: Oh, it's not vanity, Dad, it's insecurity. It's easy to understand how women can fall victim to our culture's worship at the altar of youth and beauty. "
"Niles: Precisely. Women over forty can't help but feel unattractive if they don't have perfect hair, porcelain skin... limpid eyes... pouting lips... and the voluptuous contours of a goddess. "
"Niles: I'm sorry, I forgot what my point was. "
"Daphne: Oh, I know just what you mean, Dr. Crane. I fell victim to that pressure myself once. I had a mole removed. "
"Niles: Where? "
"Daphne: Just south of Manchester. "
"Niles: I meant where on your body? "
"Daphne: So did I "
"Frasier: You know, what time is the surgery tomorrow? "
"Niles: First thing in the morning, which is why I'm here. I know I'm being silly and I'm sure everything's going to be fine but I was wondering if I might have your moral support down at the hospital. "
"Martin: Yeah, sure, no problem. "
"Niles: Thank you. Well, I expect I’ll be off. "
"Martin: Hey, Niles. Not that it's any of my business but, er, how much is this whole thing setting you back? "
"Niles: Somewhere in the neighborhood of twenty-five thousand dollars. "
"Martin: Jeez, for an extra five grand you can get a whole new wife from the Philippines. "
"TO: "
"Sternstein: Ah, Dr. Crane. "
"Niles: Dr. Sternstein. "
"Sternstein: Excuse me for a moment. Your wife is still in recovery but everything went splendidly so you can see her in a few minutes. "
"Niles: Thank you, doctor. "
"Sternstein: All right, Mrs. Patterson. "
"Niles: Did you hear that, Frasier? He said everything went fine. He's an incredible plastic surgeon. Did you see that woman? Whoever Mr. Patterson is, he's a very lucky man. "
"Frasier: Maybe that was Mr. Patterson "
"Frasier: You know, guess whose room I passed by on my way down the hall? Artie Walsh. "
"Niles: Dad's old partner? "
"Frasier: Yes, apparently he was in for some tests last week and the results weren't very good. "
"Niles: Oh no, I always liked him. "
"Frasier: Yeah. "
"Niles: I still remember him inviting us to his house for weenie roasts when we were kids. "
"Frasier: I'm sure he remembers you too, asking for a salad niçoise "
"Niles: Do you think Dad knows he's here? "
"Frasier: Oh, I doubt it. "
"Niles: Do you think he wants to know? "
"Frasier: Probably not. They haven't spoken in years. "
"Niles: I don't suppose you got Artie to tell you what their big fight was all about? "
"Frasier: No, he's just as tight-lipped as Dad is. Although, with a little arm twisting, I did get him to admit it was all Dad's fault "
"Martin: Hey, you guys should really try the cafeteria here. They've got a new chef - he's from Yemen. "
"Frasier: So many of the great ones are "
"Niles: Dad, you know who's in the hospital here? Artie Walsh. He's not at all well. "
"Martin: Yeah, one of the guys told me. They might have to scoop out half of his intestines. Here, taste this meatloaf, it's got just the right amount of chewiness. "
"Niles: No, thank you. Are you gonna go see him? "
"Martin: No, can't think of any good reason why I should. "
"Frasier: Because he was your best friend for twenty years and now he's sick? "
"Martin: Hey, he never came to see me when I took that bullet - when I was lying there with stuff flowing in and out of tubes and drains from every bodily opening. At least taste this gravy "
"Frasier: Dad, we are talking about a few minutes out of your life Just long enough to sit there and have a little chat with a very sick man. I don't see why that's so impossible for you. Now, come on Believe me, you'll be glad you did. "
"Martin: Hey, listen, sonny "
"boy: that sanctimonious tone might wow 'em on the radio but it doesn't cut any ice with me When I say no, that's just what I mean. I'm not sitting and chatting with Artie Walsh "
"Frasier: Artie thought as much. "
"Martin: Why, what did he say? "
"Frasier: He said you wouldn't have the guts to go see him. "
"Martin: He said that? "
"Frasier: Yeah, then he snickered a little "
"Martin: Well, I've got news for him. I've got the guts. I've got twice the guts he has, and after his surgery tomorrow, I'll have four times the guts "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Artie, it's me again. "
"Artie: Martin? "
"Martin: Artie. "
"Frasier: When he knew you were in here, he insisted on rushing right over, didn't you, Dad? "
"Martin: Yeah, well... they said you were in pretty rocky shape. "
"Artie: Well, they've been saying a lot of things. "
"Artie: Well, er, Marty, how's it been going? "
"Martin: Okay. "
"Frasier: Good. Small steps. "
"Martin: Sorry you're laid up. "
"Artie: Thanks. It was nice of you to come by. "
"Martin: Well, I guess somebody had to be the big man. "
"Artie: What? What's that supposed to mean? "
"Martin: I think you know what that means. "
"Artie: No, why don't you tell me what it means "
"Martin: I mean I'm being a lot bigger than you were when I was in here "
"Artie: You mean when you had that lousy bullet in your hip? "
"Martin: Hey, that lousy bullet hurt, pal "
"Artie: Not enough "
"Martin: Well, it's too bad you never took a bullet, it might have improved you. "
"Artie: Just be glad you didn't take it in the butt - it could have caused brain damage "
"Martin: Oh, you always have to have the last word, don't you "
"Artie: Not with you, I don't want any words with you "
"Martin: Well, that's too bad, because I've got a couple of real choice ones "
"Frasier: Dad "
"Frasier: Next time we'll stay longer. "
"Martin: Stop staring at me like that, Eddie, I didn't touch your damn doll Look, even if I did, you know, I did it for your own good. You were becoming the joke of the park, even the poodles were laughing at you Oh, all right Here. "
"Martin: I gotta get that dog a G.I. Joe "
"Niles: Yes, yes, Maris, I'm sure. No, no, you can't gain weight from a glucose IV. No, no, my little worry wart, there's no such thing as a NutraSweet drip. Just, just try to close your eyes and go to sleep. Goodnight, Puppy Toes. "
"Daphne: Is everything okay with your wife? "
"Niles: Actually, no. She can't get along with any of her nurses. Honestly, I'm at a loss to understand how a reputable hospital can hire nothing but troublemakers "
"Frasier: Yes, the Little Sisters of Mercy have always had that reputation "
"Niles: Dad, I didn't get a chance to ask you, how did your reunion with Artie go? "
"Martin: Lousy. "
"Daphne: If you don't mind me asking; what started this bad blood between the two of you? "
"Martin: He spread a rumor about me through the department. "
"Frasier: About what? "
"Martin: None of your business. "
"Frasier: Oh, come on. "
"Martin: No, I don't want to talk about it. Subject closed. "
"Niles: Must have been pretty bad. "
"Frasier: Oh, yes. Must have been on the take. "
"Daphne: More likely drugs. "
"Niles: Drugs, yes, drugs... Or sex. Could be sex. "
"Frasier: Or all three "
"Martin: Oh, all right, it was worse than any of that. He told people... I cried at 'Brian's Song.' "
"Frasier: Dear God You always think that's the kind of thing that happens to other people's fathers, not your own "
"Martin: Well, I wasn't crying Me and Artie were sitting at Duke's watching the movie and I got some pretzel salt in my eye Artie thought it was the funniest thing in the world, the next thing I know he's telling everybody. And then I become the joke of the department. Other cops left Kleenex on my desk They called me 'Boo Hoo Crane.' "
"Daphne: Well, I suppose I can understand your being upset with him. But, what's he so cheesed off with you for? "
"Martin: Well, I guess I let something slip about the size of his wife's behind. "
"Daphne: I beg your pardon? "
"Martin: Well, she's got this gigantic rear end, I mean it's enormous. It looks like she's shoplifting throw pillows "
"Frasier: And you felt compelled to share that with him? "
"Martin: Well, for twenty years I tried not to and then I guess one day I let my guard down. We were both coming into the station house and he says, 'Hi' and I say, 'Hi' and he says, 'How's the wife?' and I said, 'At least she doesn't have an ass the size of Albuquerque' "
"Niles: And that's it - a twenty-year relationship down the drain because of a little name calling "
"Martin: No, there's more to it than that. I mean, Artie always had to have the last word. Always He couldn't leave well enough alone. "
"Martin: He couldn't let sleeping dogs lie. "
"Martin: You'd think it was all over and then he'd start saying something again. Look, can we drop this? Artie obviously still has an attitude and I've got better things to do than sit around a hospital room taking abuse. "
"Niles: Oh God, I'm due back with Maris. Oh, if anyone needs me, I'll be sleeping at the hospital tonight. "
"Frasier: Why? "
"Niles: Maris's doctor feels it's more soothing for the patient to duplicate the home environment as closely as possible. So I slipped a pearl-handed revolver under her pillow and got myself a room across the hall. "
"Frasier: I think we better say a little prayer for the night nurse "
"Daphne: You know, it's such a shame your father and your friend just can't let bygones be bygones. Especially at a time like this. "
"Frasier: I don't know what else to do, he's just so damn stubborn. "
"Daphne: Well, maybe if I had a go at it. You know, in the past year and a half I've come to have a pretty good understanding of how the Crane mind works - when it works "
"Daphne: Mr. Crane, about your partner... "
"Martin: I don't want to talk about it anymore "
"Daphne: No, no, I just wanted to tell you I'm on your side. After the way he treated you, I say good riddance to bad rubbish. "
"Martin: Damn right "
"Daphne: It's hard to see how you could have had any good times together. "
"Martin: Well, there weren't many. Well, occasionally we'd go fishing together. "
"Daphne: That doesn't sound like much fun. "
"Martin: Well, not the way I did it. But Artie got it into his head that he was going to teach me. He even went out and bought this beaten old boat. He always said after we retired we'd get more use out of it. "
"Daphne: Yeah, well, it seems awfully pushy of him to foist his interests on you. "
"Martin: Oh, it wasn't so bad. I remember one time I bust my arm reeling in what turned out to be someone's old bedroom slipper. You know what Artie did? He just unhooked it and threw it right on the barbecue. "
"Daphne: Well, I guess maybe he wasn't such a bad guy after all. "
"Martin: You know, maybe you're right. I listen to myself talking and I sound like a big fool. Thanks Daphne, you really opened my eyes. "
"Daphne: I thought I might. "
"Martin: Yeah, I'm going to march right down to that hospital, buy him a big stuffed animal and then throws my arms around him and never, ever let him go "
"Daphne: You really are a hateful old sod, aren't you? "
"Martin: Come on, Eddie, time for your walk "
"Frasier: Hello? Yes, it is. Oh, I see. Yes, well, I guess it isn't really a shock, considering. Yes, I'm sure they did everything they could. Thank you. "
"Martin: What was that? "
"Frasier: We'll talk about it later, Dad. "
"Martin: Is everything okay? "
"Frasier: Why do you ask? "
"Martin: Well, I don't know. You saying, 'I'm sorry' and stuff like 'I'm sure you did everything you could' and it's natural to be concerned. "
"Frasier: You thought that call was about Artie, didn't you? "
"Martin: No "
"Frasier: Yes, you did "
"Martin: So what if I did? "
"Frasier: Well, it just proves my point - you still care about him "
"Martin: All right, so suppose I do care about him, suppose I do feel bad about this stupid fight and want it over. What the hell can I do? "
"Frasier: Well, it's up to you. But if you like, I could drive you down to the hospital. "
"Martin: I don't need you to lead me. I can drive myself. "
"Frasier: No, you can't. "
"Martin: Why not? "
"Frasier: That was your mechanic, your transmission's dead. "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Artie? "
"Artie: Oh, Jeez... "
"Frasier: Oh, now look. You guys got off on the wrong foot... "
"Martin: All right, Frasier, I'll handle this. Artie... Will you turn the TV off? "
"Artie: I'll turn it down. "
"Martin: Listen, Artie, I'm sorry about some of those things I said earlier on, okay? Maybe all of them. I guess I was still a little steamed that you never came to see me in the hospital. "
"Artie: I didn't come by because... well, I just didn't think you'd want to see me. "
"Martin: Of course I wanted to see you "
"Artie: That's what my wife said. "
"Martin: Oh, yeah, Loretta. "
"Artie: Anyway, I'm glad you could come by. And I know it's not easy. Especially for someone as stubborn as you are. "
"Martin: Me stubborn? Hey, listen pal, I'm not the one who always has to have the last... "
"Martin: Oh, you're right, Artie. I am stubborn. And it wasn't easy. "
"Artie: Thanks, Martin. "
"Martin: Listen, Artie and I have a couple of things to talk about so, if you, er, if you'll just wait outside, it'll be a lot easier. "
"Frasier: Oh, fine, Dad. Anything I can say right now would just be irrelevant. One thing you learn as a therapist is once things are working well between people, anything else you can say would just be... "
"Martin: So, what's a rotten old cop like you doing in a joint like this? "
"Artie: Believe me, it wasn't my idea. This is not how I expected things to end. "
"Martin: What are you talking about, end? You're going to be out on the street raising hell before you know it. "
"Artie: I don't know, Marty. The doctors aren't exactly tossing their hats up in the air over this one. "
"Martin: Hey, my sons are doctors, they don't know nothing Now, listen, you're going to get yourself out of here, okay? Cause we've got a lot of lost time to make up for. Hey, do you still have that stupid boat? "
"Artie: Oh, yeah. I hung on to it. "
"Martin: Good, we'll sink that damn thing yet Hey, Artie, do you remember that time you barbecued the bedroom slipper? "
"Artie: I kept telling you, stuff always tastes better when you catch it yourself. "
"Niles: Frasier. What are you doing here? "
"Frasier: Oh, I finally got Dad and Artie Walsh talking again. Of course I did have to resort to cheap, manipulative pseudo- psychology. "
"Niles: Always go to your strengths. "
"Frasier: Well, what about you? It looks like you've bought out the entire gift shop. Maris should be pleased. "
"Niles: Oh, this isn't for Maris, it's for her nurses. They're having a meeting right now to discuss her care and from what people tell me - a hospital strike can be ugly "
"Nurse: Visiting hours are over, gentlemen. "
"Frasier: Oh, thank you, I'll go round up dad. "
"Niles: Er, excuse me, do you work on my wife's floor - Mrs. Maris Crane? "
"Nurse: Yes, I do. "
"Niles: I'd like you to have these chocolates. "
"Nurse: I'm on the night shift. "
"Niles: And this lovely watch. "
"Frasier: Hey, dad? It's time to go. "
"Artie: What? You get another phone call about your dad's transmission? Your dad told me about that. "
"Frasier: Well, all I was doing was... "
"Artie: Yeah, yeah, I know what you were doing. Thanks, kid. "
"Frasier: See you soon. "
"Martin: Okay, now, we've got a deal, all right? As soon as you get sprung from this joint, you've got to give me some serious fishing lessons. "
"Artie: IF I get out. "
"Martin: WHEN you get out You're not getting the last word on this one "
"Artie: See you, Marty. "
"Martin: See you, Art. "
"Artie: Bye. "
"Martin: Bye. "
"Artie: Take care. "
"Martin: Take care. "
"Artie: Stay loose "
"door: "
"Martin: See you, Artie "
"Artie: See you, Marty. "

"Frasier: Well, I think we have time for one last call, who's up next, Roz? "
"Roz: We have Elliot, on line three. "
"Frasier: Hello, Elliot. I'm listening. "
"Elliot: Well, you see Dr. Crane, I have a problem. I'm a salesman... "
"Frasier: Ah, a salesman? How old are you? "
"Elliot: Forty-three. "
"Frasier: Forty-three? "
"Elliot: Yes. "
"Frasier: Now tell. Let's be truthful. "
"Elliot: I'm forty-three. "
"Frasier: Elliot, we were not born yesterday. Clearly you are just an adolescent, trying to prove to your little friends how clever you are by getting on the radio. But you know what you are really doing, you're taking time away from people with real problems. "
"Elliot: Hey, I'm forty-three, I was born in New Providence, and I have a very young-sounding voice that people make fun of all the time "
"Frasier: Oh, I'm so sorry, Elliot, that was very insensitive of me. "
"Elliot: Hah Gotcha, Dr. Doofus "
"Frasier: Yes, indeed you did 'get us,' Elliot, but we are not so stuffy here on this program that we can't laugh at ourselves from time to time. Roz, can't you keep these pimply- faced little maggots off the air? Well, that's our show for today. This is Dr. Crane signing off and wishing you good mental health. "
"Frasier: Have a good weekend, Roz. "
"Roz: Wait, Frasier. I want to ask you a question, and I want you to give me an honest answer. "
"Frasier: No, that outfit does not make you look fat. "
"Roz: Well, that wasn't the question. But why would you think it was? "
"Frasier: Well, as a rule, when a woman prefaces a question with 'I want an honest answer,' that's usually the question. "
"Roz: Well, I'm not that insecure. "
"Frasier: Good. I'm sorry, you were right. Your question, please. "
"Roz: Would you say the back of my head is unattractive? "
"Frasier: Roz, have you completely lost your mind? "
"Roz: No, I'm serious. You know how I have season tickets to the Seahawks games? Well, there's this really cute guy who sits right behind me, and a few weeks ago we said 'Hi' and we smiled at each other, but so far he hasn't asked me out yet. So I was thinking there was something, you know, weird about the back of my head. "
"Frasier: Roz, there could be hundreds of reasons why he hasn't asked you out. "
"Roz: Thank you, that makes me feel much better. "
"Frasier: No, no, maybe he's married, maybe he's in a relationship, maybe he's gay. Or maybe, just maybe, he's there to watch a football game and not cruise for chicks. "
"Roz: ...Okay, you're right. I'm being ridiculous. "
"Frasier: Of course you are. See you Monday. "
"Roz: All right. "
"Roz: I saw that [he runs out of the booth, she chases him to get his opinion] Wait "
"Frasier: You are not getting the rest of my scone, so just forget it... Mmm. Really good, too. Yum, yum yum yum... Listen, I don't care, you can sit there 'til you're blue in the face... As far as I'm concerned, you don't even exist, you're not even here... [he goes back to reading his paper, but soon crumbles under Eddie's unrelenting stare] Oh, all right, here Get fat "
"Martin: Ah, got you again, huh? You're such a soft touch. "
"Frasier: I am not. "
"Martin: Well, he never begs while I'm eating. "
"Frasier: Maybe he doesn't like what you're eating. "
"Martin: Trust me, he's not picky. I saw him eat a beetle. "
"Daphne: Eddie? Let's go for another walk. "
"Martin: I thought you already walked him this morning? "
"Daphne: I did, twice. "
"Martin: He's gotta go again? "
"Daphne: No, actually I do [she catches herself as Martin and Frasier give her sharp looks] That didn't sound right. There's a very nice-looking gentleman who plays frisbee in the park with his Labrador. Eddie and I are hoping to run into them again. Come on, Eddie. He's just playing hard to get. "
"Frasier: I'm glad somebody is. "
"Martin: Hey Frasier, how about fixing that toilet of yours? It keeps running all the time, the noise is driving me crazy. "
"Frasier: All right, Dad. I'll call a plumber. "
"Martin: What do you mean, 'Call a plumber?' You've got two hands, fix it yourself. "
"Frasier: Dad, I am a doctor. I have more important things to do with my life than to fix a toilet. "
"Niles: Good news, Frasier. I pulled some strings with the spa, and they're squeezing us in for a salt glow with our Swedish massage. "
"Frasier: Fabulous "
"Martin: Ah, forget about a plumber, I'll do it myself. My manicurist cancelled on me. "
"Frasier: Dad, you will not do it yourself. "
"Martin: I'll bet you don't even have any tools around here. "
"Frasier: Oh well, that's where you're wrong. Let me show you something, mister. Here... "
"Frasier: See this? Every possible tool for every possible need. Got this from Hammacher-Schlemmer. "
"Niles: Is that turquoise inlay? "
"Frasier: Yes, it also comes in ebony and onyx. "
"Niles: Onyx. Onyx is so showy. I don't... "
"Frasier: Oh, I don't think so. I love onyx, onyx is a stone that resonates within me... "
"until: "
"Martin: This is why I never took any home movies. You two realize what a couple of delicate doilies you are? Sheesh, you don't even know the meaning of the word self-reliant. Thank God there's not a national disaster happening, you'd be helpless. "
"Niles: Oh A lemon zester "
"Frasier: Yes... You know Niles, I'd actually like to fix that toilet, just to prove Dad wrong. "
"Niles: Frasier, when a man is born with superior genes, the last challenge he should face involving a toilet is learning how to use one. "
"Frasier: Yes, but we-we've conquered the intellectual world, but in the world of nuts and bolts we're at the mercy of tradesmen. "
"Niles: You're serious? "
"Frasier: Yes We could borrow some tools and fix it ourselves. It would be good practical experience, and it would shut Dad up. "
"Niles: We'll show him We're made of tougher stuff than he thinks "
"Frasier: Exactly. "
"Niles: And it's early. We can let the Eucalyptus wrap be our reward. "
"TO: ) "
"Niles: Maris. I'm afraid I'll be delayed a few hours. Frasier and I have taken it upon ourselves to tackle a home repair. Yes, I'm working with my hands... Yes, I've worked up a bit of a sweat... I suppose I could take my shirt off. "
"Frasier: Niles, what are you doing? "
"Niles: She seems to be getting aroused at my attempt at manual labor. Maris? I'm holding some sort of wrench... "
"Frasier: Hello, Maris? Maris, Niles is busy now... No, never mind what I'm wearing. [hangs up] May we continue, please? "
"Niles: Fine. All right. 'Take the ball-cock assembly, thread it through the tank hole.” "
"Frasier: Done. "
"Niles: 'And fasten it under the tank with a lock-nut.' "
"Frasier: Yes, very well, lock-nut. You see Niles, until today, you didn't even know what a locknut was. "
"Niles: That Niles is dead. Call me Dutch. "
"Frasier: You know Niles, working with our hands like this, I'm reminded of that glorious tradition of the Amish barn raising. All the men of the village coming together, the mind, the muscle, all toward that simple, yet extraordinary goal. [replaces the tank lid] All right... we are ready to flush. "
"Niles: Here's to what the Crane brothers can accomplish when they put their minds to it. Flush away. "
"Frasier: It's working Oh my God, it's working. Look, it's draining out of the tank, into the bowl... "
"Niles: It's filling the bowl, and then the tank – oh, I've seen it a million times, but never has it meant so much "
"Frasier: It's glorious. "
"Niles: Frasier? Shouldn't it be stopping now? "
"Frasier: One would think so, yes. "
"Niles: Ohh, ohh "
"Frasier: Ohh Look it up. What does it say to do now? "
"Niles: It says - oh, it says nothing Where are all your Amish friends now? "
"TO: "
"Niles: The plumber's been called, the wine is properly chilled, suddenly my world makes sense again. "
"Frasier: We've had a tough day. We've tangled with a little pipe and porcelain. Now it's Montrachet time. "
"Niles: When you think about it, our only mistake today was trying to fix that toilet ourselves. "
"Frasier: Yes, we tampered with the natural order of things. "
"Niles: But now, order has been restored. By hiring a plumber, that plumber can now afford, say, a Dolly Parton album. Miss Parton can then finance a national tour which will, of course, come to Seattle, allowing some local promoter to make enough money to send his cross-dressing teenaged son to us for $150- an-hour therapy. "
"Frasier: To the circle of life. "
"Frasier: That must be the plumber. "
"Martin: Well, are you going to answer that, or are you going to hire somebody to do that for you too? "
"Frasier: Dad, we tried, okay? "
"Daphne: Oh please, I wasn't doing anything. Let me get it. "
"Danny: Somebody call for a plumber? "
"Daphne: Not nearly soon enough. "
"Martin: Follow me. "
"Daphne: What a lovely way to spend an afternoon. "
"Frasier: Well Daphne, we're not plumbers, we're psychiatrists. "
"Daphne: Yeah, well there are some heads you shouldn't tamper with. "
"Niles: Frasier, you've got to get him out of here. "
"Frasier: What? "
"Niles: That man is not fit to touch your toilet "
"Frasier: Niles, have you been self-medicating again? "
"Niles: That was Danny Kreizel. "
"Frasier: 'Kreizel the Weasel?' How can you be sure, it's been twenty- five years. "
"Niles: I'd recognize him anywhere. He bullied me throughout my entire childhood "
"Frasier: He certainly didn't recognize you just now. "
"Niles: Well, perhaps that was because he wasn't sticking my head down a toilet and FLUSHING IT That was his trademark. He called it... a swirly. "
"Frasier: Niles, you don't have to remind me of the Kreizel reign of terror. I'm quite convinced I can trace my fear of confined spaces back to the time when his older brother Billy shoved me into a locker, wearing a girl's field hockey uniform "
"Niles: I'm sorry, I didn't mean to deny you your pain. "
"Frasier: Thank you. "
"Niles: I can still hear the laughter, and Kreizel's mocking voice as he’d hoist me over the bowl. 'Hold your breath, Jocko' Then the crowd would start its awful chant. 'There goes Crane, Down the Drain' [starts to bow over the armchair] 'There goes Crane, Down the...' "
"Frasier: NILES Niles, get a hold of yourself Stop it Stop, stop. It's all right. You're no longer an awkward teenager, you're a renowned psychiatrist. Danny Kreizel may have won a battle or two back in junior high, but that's where he peaked. You won the war. You know the expression, 'Living well is the best revenge'? "
"Niles: It's a wonderful expression. Just don't know how true it is. Don't see it turning up in a lot of opera plots. “Ludwig, maddened by the poisoning of his entire family, wreaks vengeance on Gunther in the third act by living well.” "
"Frasier: All right, Niles. "
"Niles: “Whereupon Woton, upon discovering his deception, wreaks vengeance on Gunther in the third act again by living even better than the Duke.” "
"Frasier: Oh, all right "
"TO: Frasier's bathroom. "
"Martin: That's a new part, right? "
"Danny: Yeah. "
"Martin: 'Cause I'm sure you're charging me for a new part, so I wouldn't want you charging me for a used part. "
"Danny: What are you, the plumbing police? "
"Martin: I'll be back. "
"Niles: Don't mind me, just came in for some aspirin. Tannic acid gives me the tiniest headache. That's the price I pay for drinking nothing but expensive wine. "
"Danny: Hey. [whistles to get Niles's attention] You got a real mess here. I'm gonna have to call the shop, have my partner bring out a whole lotta new parts. You're looking at two guys on golden time, is that okay with you? "
"Niles: It's only money. Hmph... "
"Danny: Say, uh, has somebody been trying to fix this thing? "
"Niles: Not me. I don't even set the clock in my Mercedes E320. "
"Danny: Boy, that's a nice car. "
"Niles: Yes, I should say it is. "
"Danny: Yeah, I had one for a while. But it was too small for the whole family, so we upgraded to the S class. "
"Niles: You have the big Mercedes? "
"Danny: Oh, yeah. And I gotta tell you, my 13 year-old's already got his eye on it. That's a great kid right there. Except he got in a fight at school the other day. "
"Niles: Oh, really? With some small- boned child with superior language skills? "
"Danny: Nah. It was some big jerk on the football team who tried to steal his lunch money. "
"Niles: Ah. "
"Danny: Yeah. "
"Niles: Well, there's nothing like a bully. "
"Danny: Well, I gotta tell you, I'd rather he'd be a bully than one of those wussy kids that always get picked on. You know the kind I'm talking about? Kids who are too gutless to fight back? "
"Niles: You admire someone who fights back, do you? "
"Danny: Well, sure. I mean, if you don't fight back, what are you? You're a wuss, you're a wimp, you're a... "
"Frasier: STOP Niles, leave the man alone while he's trying to work "
"Daphne: What's Dr. Crane doing? "
"Frasier: He's a little frustrated because I wouldn't let him do something. He's taking his anger out on my ficus. "
"Daphne: I've never seen him so angry, he's like a madman. "
"Niles: Good Lord There's a bee out there the size of a wood finch "
"Frasier: Niles, you've had a chance to cool off. Are you ready to talk about this now? "
"Niles: No, I'm not ready yet. "
"to: Kitchen. "
"Frasier: Niles, I have to be honest. I'm a little disappointed in you. Were you actually going to stick another human being's head into a toilet? "
"Niles: You don't seem to understand, I feel this RAGE It's as if this BEAST has been awakened within me Could you get that for me? "
"Frasier: Niles, you see, there is a beast in all of us. Part of becoming a rational adult is learning to control it. That's what separates us from the Kreizels of this world. "
"Niles: That and their tendency to squat on their haunches and groom each other. "
"Frasier: Don't you see? You have an opportunity with Danny that I never had with Billy. To confront him as a rational adult and achieve some closure. "
"Niles: Easier said than done, Frasier. One look at that oafish face, those dead Kreizel eyes, and you see there is no chance for communication. "
"Frasier: Yes, there is, Niles. There has to be. "
"Niles: I can't go in there and talk to him. If the coward turns his back on me, I'll attack him again. "
"Frasier: No, you won't. You're not a child anymore. [taking Niles by the hand] Now come with me, I'm taking you to the bathroom "
"to: Bathroom "
"Niles: Excuse me sir, I'd like to have a word with you. "
"Danny: Yeah, go ahead. "
"Niles: I'd like to take you back in time to the 1970's. There was an intellectually gifted young student at John Adams Junior High. You took it upon yourself to terrorize that student, simply because he was different from you. I was that student. "
"Danny: No kidding? "
"Niles: I was hoping we could step into the living room and come to some sort of understanding. "
"Danny: It's okay with me. Any room in the house is still fifty-nine bucks an hour. I'll be right back, Billy. "
"Frasier: Billy? "
"Billy: Ah, that's my brother for ya. Always getting into stuff. But if you ask me, your friend over there is getting all worked up over nothing. "
"Frasier: You think so, Billy? "
"Billy: Kids pick on other kids, it's part of growing up. If anything, it made those weak kids tougher. "
"Frasier: Really? "
"Billy: Come on, you're a big guy. You must have been involved in some kinda stuff? "
"Frasier: Oh, I was involved... "
"Frasier: Billy, I would like to take you back in time... "
"Billy: No. Let me take YOU back. I remember once, we jammed this poindexter into a locker, wearing a girl's field hockey uniform "
"TO: Living Room "
"Danny: No, I'm sorry. I just don't remember you. "
"Niles: Well, perhaps you'll remember third period gym class. You used to make me wear my jockstrap like a tiara? "
"Danny: Oh, yeah Were you the kid who used to carry his gym shorts in an attaché case? "
"Niles: ...It was a valise. "
"Danny: I remember you. Boy, those were some crazy times. You ever see any of the old gang? "
"Niles: Look, you're missing the point. I was severely scarred by those experiences... "
"Danny: Hey, wait a minute. I can't defend everything I did back in junior high, I mean who can? But let's face it, when you show up at school wearing a tweed blazer with elbow patches and carrying a valise, I mean, I think the guilt here is fifty- fifty. "
"TO: Bathroom "
"Billy: He's yelling at us something about 'repressed tendencies,' so we stuffed a fire extinguisher down his pants We called it... "
"Frasier: A jet pack. "
"Billy: That's it Man, you remember them all. "
"TO: Living Room "
"Niles: Well then, my next question to you would be “Why would you behave this way?” "
"Danny: Well, I don't know. I mean, I guess because people thought it was funny. "
"Niles: I see, I see. So then, to get this validation, you would, say, squeeze my head between your ankles and hop around the lunch room? "
"Danny: I did that to you? "
"Niles: Yes. How does that make you feel? "
"Danny: ...Well, kinda bad "
"Niles: The healing has begun "
"TO: Bathroom. "
"Billy: So, so in front of the whole bus, we pants him He's yelling at us, 'Gimme back my pants' But - whoops – they fell out the window "
"TO: Living Room. "
"Niles: So then it's possible these acts of aggression were misplaced outbursts aimed at your father. "
"Danny: Yes. "
"Niles: He was the real bully, wasn't he? "
"Danny: Oh, yes "
"Niles: Let it out, Danny, let it out "
"Danny: Nothing I ever did was good enough for him I am so sorry that I picked on you, man. I just wanted to be good at something, and I was good at that. "
"Niles: You were the best. "
"TO: bathroom "
"Billy: Then we made him hula in his underwear in front of all the girls You shoulda been there "
"Frasier: I WAS there "
"TO: Lounge area. "
"Danny: Thanks. This has just been terrific for me. "
"Niles: I can't take all the credit. Half the thanks belongs to my brother. He convinced me a civilized person can work anything out, as long as he approach it in a calm, rational manner. "
"Frasier: Run, Niles, run The beast is loose "
"TO: "
"Martin: So you really shoved his head right in here? "
"Frasier: I don't know, Dad. It's all really sort of a blur. I guess I just lost control. "
"Martin: Bet it felt good though, didn't it? "
"Frasier: No... it felt damn good. "
"Martin: Ah, it's too bad you didn't do it twenty years ago, you could have given him a much better swirly. These low-flow toilets don't have the same velocity as the old ones. So what did he do to you? "
"Frasier: He didn't have the nerve to do a thing. "
"Martin: You paid him off, huh? "
"Frasier: I've never written a check so quickly in my life. "
"Martin: Well, there she goes. Good as new. "
"Frasier: Thanks, Dad. Can I buy you a beer? "
"Martin: Oh yeah, sounds good. Come on, Eddie. "
"Martin: Oh, for God's sake Eddie, don't drink out of the toilet. Some guy just had his head in there "

"Marie: Um, you see, Dr. Crane, there's this man I'd like to go out with, but he's forty years old and he's never been married. Do you think that means something? "
"Frasier: Well, it could mean he has a fear of commitment... or it could mean he's just been lucky "
"Frasier: Marie, that was a joke. "
"Marie: Did I mention I'm calling from a pay phone? "
"Frasier: Alright, alright, Marie, um... I would say give him a shot, but uh... I'd keep that caution bulb lit. Thank you for your call, Marie. Who's next, Roz? "
"Roz: If you ask me, it's divorced people you have to watch out for. Someone's never been married - it might just mean they're a careful shopper. Whereas your divorcé will bite into any old piece of fruit without even giving it a squeeze first. "
"Frasier: The preceding was an unbiased opinion from my never-been- married producer, Roz, who, incidentally, has squeezed more fruit than Tropicana. May we take another call, please? "
"Roz: We could, but it's time for a station break. "
"Frasier: Oh. Oh well then, we'll be right back after this. "
"Frasier: Roz, didn't we just take a break? "
"Roz: The lot was full this morning - I had to park at a meter. I'll be right back. "
"Frasier: Oh. Fine, just hurry. "
"Roz: Well, I may have to flirt my way out of a parking ticket "
"Frasier: Oh, just go "
"Roz: OK, OK "
"Roz: Ow, ow, ow, ow "
"Frasier: My God Are you alright? "
"Bulldog: I got the wind knocked out of me, but I guess I'm OK. "
"Roz: Ow, ow, my ankle "
"Frasier: Here, Roz. Does this hurt? "
"Frasier: Alright, there's no nerve damage at least. "
"Gil: Still, one ought to have an X-ray. "
"Frasier: Yeah, come on. "
"Roz: Frasier, Frasier, the show "
"Frasier: No, that's alright, Roz, I'll get someone to fill in for me. "
"Roz: No, I mean right now You've got dead air. "
"Frasier: Oh, God "
"Bulldog: Take the shoe off. "
"Roz: Oh, oh... "
"Gil: Oh, dear. "
"Roz: What is it? "
"Gil: I see it's been a while since our last pedicure. "
"Roz: Who is it? "
"Frasier: It's Frasier. "
"Roz: It's open. "
"Frasier: Hi, Roz. How were things at the emergency room? "
"Roz: Frustrating. You know how it is - you're sitting there in complete agony and every crybaby with a gunshot wound waltzes right in ahead of you. How was it after I left? "
"Frasier: It was OK. Weird Bruce from Engineering took over for you. That's quite a boot collection. Wouldn't it be easier just to put notches in your bed post? "
"Roz: Those are mine. You hate the way I've decorated, don't you? "
"Frasier: No, no. Matter of fact, I admire your courage. "
"Roz: Is that for me? "
"Frasier: Oh, yes. Freud said that there are only two things we need to make us "
"happy: work, and love. "
"Roz: Aw, thanks, Frasier So you brought me work. "
"Frasier: Well, I thought answering some of the fan mail that had been piling up would give you something to do. And remember, this time death threats don't get photos. "
"Roz: Who is it? "
"Bulldog: It's Bulldog "
"Roz: Shh Pretend we're not here. "
"Frasier: Roz, you just said, “Who is it?” "
"Bulldog: Hey, Doc "
"Frasier: Hey, Dog. "
"Bulldog: Hey, Roz Wow The whole place is a bedroom "
"Roz: What are you doing here? "
"Bulldog: Well, I kinda feel responsible for you being on the disabled list. So I brought you some deli. "
"Frasier: Nothing says I'm sorry like fatty meats. "
"Bulldog: You got your pastrami, coleslaw... OK, where's the french fries? I ordered french fries "
"Bulldog: THIS STINKS THIS IS TOTAL B.S. That apron boy is gonna... [notices another white bag on the E-Z table next to Roz's bed] Oh, here they are. "
"Frasier: To think he does it all without steroids. "
"Bulldog: You want me to stick these in the oven? "
"Roz: Actually, I'm not really very hungry. "
"Bulldog: Oh. Then I guess you're not thirsty either? [pulls out a bottle of Wild Turkey] "
"Roz: Glasses are on the top shelf. "
"Frasier: None for me, Bulldog. I'm off to the opera. "
"Roz: You can't leave "
"Bulldog: Hey, no ice cubes "
"Roz: Just chip whatever you can off the edge of the freezer. If you leave me, he'll hit on me "
"Frasier: Roz, with a sprained ankle? "
"Roz: You know what it's like in the jungle - they always go after the sick and the lame. "
"Frasier: Roz, I'd like to stay, but I'm meeting people at the opera. I've got the tickets "
"Bulldog: Here we go. I'll get you more ice in a minute when the feeling in my forehead comes back. "
"Frasier: Well, curtain’s going up. Listen, Roz, if you need anything, feel free to call me absolutely anytime. Well, except for the next three hours, of course. I'm at the opera. Oh, no, no, no... four hours, it's Wagner. Um... oh, then I've got a late supper, then right to bed, I've got an early squash game... tell you what, let's just say call me absolutely anytime after four tomorrow afternoon. "
"Bulldog: Hey. This is nice. You and me, having a drink together. "
"Roz: Yeah. It's been fun. Bye [slams her glass onto the E-Z table] "
"Bulldog: How come you only painted two toenails? "
"Roz: 'Cause it hurts too much when I reach. "
"Bulldog: You want me to finish them for you? "
"Roz: No, please, it's OK. "
"Bulldog: Hey, it's a nice colour. Goes with the bruise. "
"Roz: Bulldog, I mean it. Stop it. "
"Bulldog: Hey, you got nice feet "
"Roz: Really? You don't think they're too big? "
"Bulldog: You kidding? I could get this whole thing in my mouth, easy. "
"Roz: You know, it's really nice of you to do all this for me. Kind of surreal... but nice. "
"Bulldog: Oh, I figure if I'm nice to you... maybe you'll be nice to me. "
"Roz: I knew it, I knew it You come over here acting all sympathetic, but you're still the same old horny, low-class slimeball you've always been "
"Bulldog: Hey, before you say something that ends up offending me... look, all I wanted to ask you is if, you'd be interested in producing my show. "
"Roz: What? "
"Bulldog: Yeah, I'm not real crazy about the guy I got now. And let's face it - you're the best producer there is. "
"Roz: You really think I'm the best? "
"Bulldog: Hey, that goes without saying. "
"Roz: Well, Frasier goes without saying it every day. "
"Bulldog: Well, you don't have to answer right now, just take your time and think about it. But I gotta warn ya, when I set my mind on something, I get it. I once wanted to interview George Foreman. He said no... but I got him. I had to paint his toenails FOUR times, but I got him "
"TO: "
"Daphne: You’ve been wrapping your bandage too tight. You’ve got to keep the blood flowing to the injured ligaments. "
"Roz: Daphne, that feels great. Whatever Frasier's paying you, it's not enough. "
"Daphne: Actually, I'll need a raise to get me to “not enough.” "
"Martin: Hey, Roz "
"Roz: Hey, Martin, what's going on? "
"Martin: Oh, Niles bought me some new shoes "
"Daphne: Oh yes, look They have tassels "
"Niles: Aren't they exquisite? Those shoes were individually handmade by an artisan toiling in a hilltop village above Florence. The man is a hero there. It's an event when he completes a pair of shoes. They ring the cathedral bell and the whole town celebrates. "
"Roz: There's a town that needs a bowling alley. "
"Frasier: Evening, all "
"Niles: Hello "
"Roz: Hey, Frasier "
"Frasier: Oh Roz, Roz Did you hear the show today? I was at the top of my form I did a brilliant job of cutting a narcissist down to size "
"Frasier: Oh, thank you, Niles. So... "
"Frasier: Ooh, Dad New shoes? Do I hear cathedral bells? "
"Martin: Ring-a-ding-ding "
"Frasier: Oh, Roz, I also wanted to apologize for leaving you last night. I hope you didn't spend the whole evening fending off Bulldog's advances. "
"Roz: Oh, no Bulldog's not so bad We actually had a good time "
"Frasier: Ohhh? "
"Roz: What “ohhh?” "
"Frasier: Well, I couldn't help noticing he came in to work this morning wearing the same clothes he had on yesterday. "
"Niles: Ohhhh?? "
"Martin: What's going on? "
"Niles: Roz slept with Bulldog last night. "
"Roz: I did not How could you think that? "
"Frasier: Well, I mean - dropping by, bringing a little gift? It was obvious he was after something "
"Daphne: Well, that's not fair Dr. Crane is always dropping by and bringing me little gifts and he's not after anything "
"Roz: I did not sleep with Bulldog - he didn't even hit on me. He did want something, though - he wanted me to leave you and come be his new producer. "
"Frasier: Oh, well I wonder why he said that "
"Roz: Because he really wants me. "
"Frasier: Yes well, I think that goes without saying. "
"Roz: For his show. "
"Frasier: Oh Roz, Bulldog knows the blunt approach won't work with you, so he's being more subtle. But his ultimate goal remains to... well, to... "
"Roz: To what? "
"Niles: To play Aeneas to your Dido. Sorry you had to hear that, Daphne. "
"Daphne: Oh, that's alright. As usual, I haven't the foggiest idea what you're talking about. "
"literature: a hero of the Trojan War who escaped to Carthage, and had "
"Roz: You know, this is so insulting. You think Bulldog wants me to come work for him because he wants to get me into his bed. It doesn't even occur to you that he thinks I'm a good producer. "
"Frasier: Roz, don't you think you're being just a tad naive? "
"Roz: I'll tell you what naive is. Naive is someone who thinks he can stand there and talk to me like that without getting a crutch up his butt "
"Frasier: Roz, I can see how he’s manipulating you I’m an expert in human behavior "
"Roz: Oh, really? I've heard your expert advice The only mental disorder you've ever cured is insomnia "
"Frasier: Well, I'm surprised you had time to listen, what with being so busy with your ultra-demanding producer tasks Answering phones and pushing buttons My God, a cockatoo with a strong beak could do what you do "
"Roz: Then hire one, because I'm taking the job with Bulldog "
"Roz: That's it I am outta here Take a picture, 'cause I'm not in your life You have seen the last of me Sayonara Oh damn, my purse. "
"Frasier: Well Bruce, I see we are loaded with callers here. What line is next? "
"Bruce: What's your favorite number? "
"Frasier: Three. "
"Bruce: Damn. What's your other favorite number? "
"Frasier: Why don't you just let me handle this? "
"Frasier: Hello, you're on the line with Frasier Crane. I'm listening. "
"Francesca: Hi, Dr. Crane. Um, my name is Francesca and I'm calling about my boyfriend. Well, he says he loves me, but I just can't get over this fear that I'm going to come home one day and he's not going to be there. I don't know. It probably stems from my childhood when my father left us. "
"Frasier: Oh Francesca, you are suffering from a fear of abandonment. But trust me, I'm here for you. "
"Francesca: Thank you, Dr. Crane. I'm always so afraid that people I count on will just disappear and I'll be left with... "
"Bruce: Sorry "
"Frasier: Francesca, please... we had a little technical glitch there. But we were almost out of time anyway. Please, if you'll call in tomorrow, I'll make sure you're the first order of business. Please call. Well, we're just about wrapped up here, folks... I'll see you tomorrow, Seattle. "
"Bruce: Good show, Dr. Crane. "
"Frasier: You think so, Bruce? "
"Bruce: Yeah "
"Frasier: Well, call me old-fashioned but when my show starts out with a screeching noise that could shatter crystal, then moves on to an open mike while I'm eating a bag of potato chips, then disconnects two manic-depressives and a woman with a fear of abandonment, I don't think it's a show we should be mailing off to the Smithsonian "
"Bruce: Don't worry, man - you'll do better tomorrow. "
"Bulldog: Yeah, it's going to be a great show, Roz. I can feel it. "
"Roz: Yeah, I'm psyched. You've got about a minute to show time. "
"Frasier: Hello, Roz. "
"Roz: Hello, Frasier. "
"Bulldog: Hey, Doc Long week no see. Hope you haven't been avoiding me because I stole your chick. "
"Frasier: Oh, Bruce and I are getting along splendidly "
"Roz: Yeah, I heard Bruce. What happened, the cockatoo want too much money? "
"Frasier: Bye, Roz. "
"Roz: So long, Frasier. "
"Gil: Oh, a moment, Frasier, please I'm sure word has reached your ear already about the frutti de mare party I'm throwing to celebrate our fair city's great bounty from the sea. "
"Frasier: Yes, yes. I'd love to come. "
"Gil: Well, aye, there's the rub You see, I've already invited Roz. With this rift between you two, well, the tension in the air will be thicker than my cioppino "
"Frasier: Well, Gil, I'm sure that rift will soon be over. Before long, Bulldog will prove that all he's wanted all along is just to get his hands on Roz. "
"Frasier: Ooh... in fact that moment may have arrived. "
"Frasier: Look, she's bending over Oh turn around, Bulldog "
"Gil: Oh, yes Isn't that what golfers refer to as “teeing it up?” "
"Frasier: ...helps pick up the papers "
"Gil: Oh, I'm so sorry, Frasier. I too entertained hopes for low comedy. "
"Bulldog: Attention, sports fans You're back in the doghouse with Bulldog Briscoe "
"Bulldog: Let’s talk football, Sunday's "
"lock: Broncos over the Raiders. Easy money, huh, Roz? "
"Roz: Yeah, right And men just want to cuddle. L.A. humiliated Denver last month "
"Bulldog: Wh-Wh-What? Hey, do I tell you how to cook and clean? Denver's doo It's a complete no-brainer. "
"Roz: Well then, it's right up your alley "
"Gil: You know, I'm no sports fan - but they really are quite delicious together. "
"Frasier: Yes well, enjoy it while you can. Bulldog can't keep his libido in check forever. "
"Gil: Well, of course you're right. And then Roz will come crawling back to you. "
"Frasier: Yes. In the meantime, I have to find someone halfway competent to produce my show. How hard could that be? "
"RUN: "
"dominion: through the haze; the entire studio with pictures of cats and the control panel with a real live cat; when she bends over; coming in, and eventually throws up his hands in despair; in his chair. Frasier is suitably worried. He removes his head- phones and gets up, slinging his coat over his shoulder. His shirt is un-tucked... something we don't often get to see in a well-groomed man like Frasier. "
"TO: "
"Niles: You think you had a bad week? This morning, Maris and I woke to the sound of our gardener, Yoshi, hacking his way through our prize topiary "
"Frasier: Well Niles, I've never understood why you wanted your hedges to be sculpted into the shapes of animals. "
"Niles: Well, we're both animal lovers. But Maris is unable to have pets. She, she distrusts anything that loves her unconditionally. Anyway, there was Yoshi, drunk as a lord, swinging his hedge-trimmer recklessly over his head. Before we could calm him, he had transformed Maris's prize stallion into some sort of obscene... goat-boy. The poor woman is inconsolable. "
"Frasier: Well, thank you, Niles. You've been a great deal of help. There are worse things than seeing one's career go down the toilet - I could have my hedges cut into unattractive shapes. "
"Niles: It's always about you, isn't it? "
"Frasier: Well, I'm sorry But I'm just the slightest bit panicky that I'm never going to get Roz back I've been waiting for weeks for Bulldog to make his move, and against all natural laws, he hasn't "
"Daphne: Come along Oh Hello I thought we might run into you two here. "
"Martin: Yeah Daphne and I have been out buying shoes. Oh, not that I don't appreciate the ones that you bought me, but... I thought I'd save those for special occasions, when only tassels will do. But hey, get a load of these "
"Martin: They light up when I walk away "
"Frasier: Doesn't everyone? "
"Daphne: Well, I see Mr. Congeniality here is still spreading sunshine wherever he goes. "
"Niles: Apparently things didn't go very well on his show today. "
"Martin: Oh, really? Well, you know these things go in cycles. I mean, take Bulldog's show - he's just had one great show after another lately. "
"Frasier: Hmm... what could be your point, Dad? I'm having trouble reading between the lines. "
"Martin: If you weren't so damn stubborn, you'd apologize to Roz, get her back on the show, and everybody’d be happy. "
"Frasier: As usual, you're overlooking a key psychological component in this whole issue. "
"Martin: You'd have to admit you were wrong. "
"Frasier: Exactly "
"Daphne: I don't see what's so hard about telling Roz you were wrong. "
"Frasier: You don't understand. You see, it's not the same as Dad being wrong, or your being wrong. I have a degree from Harvard Whenever I'm wrong... the world makes a little less sense. "
"Niles: Frankly, I don't understand why you want her back at all. She's pushy and opinionated. "
"Frasier: Niles, don't you think you're being just the slightest bit sexist? What's labeled “pushy” in a woman is called “assertiveness” in a man. Gone are the days when women were shunted aside to bat their eyelashes prettily and say nothing. "
"Daphne: I quite agree. "
"Frasier: Oh Daphne, please, I can handle this. "
"Daphne: Well, you’ve certainly handled it well enough so far If you ask me, it's time you get off your high horse, buy Roz some flowers and beg her forgiveness. And don't be afraid to get your knees a little dusty. "
"Frasier: Well, I'm sorry. I'm just not quite ready to swallow my pride. "
"Ed: Next time, wake me when the show's over. "
"TO: "
"Bulldog: All right, Wednesday we’ve got the NFL Picks. Then at the end of the show we do the “boner of the week.” "
"Roz: No, we can’t do that. "
"Bulldog: This is why I hate you. You are always trying to change my tried-and-true format. Why can’t we do it? "
"Roz: Because I got you an interview with Wayne Gretsky. "
"Bulldog: Wayne Gretsky? "
"Roz: Mmm-hmm. "
"Bulldog: THIS IS AWESOME THIS IS TOTAL BRILLIANCE THIS IS... a pinched nerve. Ah, ah, ah It’s an old football injury. I got my head rammed into a locker when I tried to interview Mike Ditka. Ahh "
"Roz: Here, let me help you with that. "
"Bulldog: Ah, this is great. I can’t believe it. Wayne Gretsky, the great one. Aah... Roz, you are the great one. You are some kind of producer. "
"Roz: Thanks. I’m having a great time. I owe you, Bulldog. I owe you big. "
"Roz: You know, I never would have thought this a couple of weeks ago, but you and I have great chemistry together, don’t we? "
"Bulldog: Uh-huh. I like chemistry. I flunked it, but I like it. You got any of that, uh... Wild Turkey left? "
"Roz: Yeah, sure. "
"Roz: You know, I got to be honest with you, Bulldog. When we first started working together, I never thought it would turn out like this Did you? "
"Bulldog: All along. "
"Bulldog: Hey uh, Roz, you'd better make mine a double. I'm a double kind of guy. "
"Roz: Uh-uh You're only going to get a little. There's a lot I want to do tonight, and I want you to keep up with me. "
"Bulldog: Yeah, well, uh... "
"Bulldog: All I ask is that you give me a couple of twenty-minute breaks. "
"Roz: What's that? "
"Bulldog: I uh... I thought a little music might be, uh, might be nice. "
"Roz: Can you concentrate with that on? "
"Bulldog: Oh yeah, yeah Actually uh, I find uh... "
"Bulldog: ...the distraction helps me. "
"Bulldog: Nah... second date. Don't be pushy. This is great, Roz... us working like this. "
"Bulldog: Hey, uh... did you and the Doc ever end up working... "
"Roz: What? "
"Bulldog: Did you and the Doc ever, uh... end up working like this? "
"Roz: Oh yeah. We tried it once, but he complained I talked too much. "
"Bulldog: Oh, yeah? I would have figured you for a screamer. "
"Roz: What the hell are you doing in my bed? Get out "
"Roz: Get out I asked you over here to WORK, you disgusting pervert "
"Bulldog: Hey-hey-hey You're going to have to slow down I'm getting some mixed signals here. "
"Bulldog: What are you doing? "
"Roz: Is this clear enough for you? "
"Bulldog: Hey are you crazy? My wallet's in there "
"Roz: Get out Now "
"Bulldog: Get out of my way, Doc. "
"Roz: Oh... "
"Frasier: I'm listening. "

"Frasier: Ah, yes. Another beautiful Saturday night. The moon is full, the city lights are twinkling, lovers steal kisses in the park... and here, Chez Crane, my father and his assistant sit hunched over twenty year-old photographs of a murdered hooker. Life is a banquet. "
"Daphne: I enjoy looking at your father's old case. Just because you have no plans tonight, don't spoil our harmless fun. You know, there's nothing we Brits like better than a grisly murder and a nice hot cup of tea. "
"Martin: Uh, listen Daphne, I got a lot of work to do here, so if you don't mind... "
"Daphne: Oh, excuse me. I didn't know I was bothering you. "
"Martin: Oh, I'm sorry, it's this damn case. I feel like the answer to who murdered Helen is right here. I just can't see it. "
"Frasier: Dad, you're obsessing. You stare at these grisly pictures day after day, night after night. Come on, why don't we go out and see a movie? "
"Martin: No, thanks. "
"Frasier: Let's go get a pizza. "
"Martin: Nah. "
"Frasier: Let's get tattooed. [Martin thinks about it, then shakes his head.] Oh This is ridiculous. It's a beautiful night and I'm not going to miss it. I'm going to go out and take a long walk and I'm not going by myself. "
"Martin: He likes the rhododendrons on the north side of the park. "
"Marjorie: And I just wanted to thank you, Dr. Crane. Because of your advice, I've conquered my fear of heights. I, I took it slowly, gradually going higher and higher, until here I am, right now, having lunch at the top of the Space Needle "
"Frasier: Marjorie, congratulations. I am so proud of you. "
"Marjorie: I mean, when I think of how you... "
"Frasier: God, what's wrong? What happened? "
"Marjorie: I just looked down. "
"Frasier: Well, Marjorie, don't do that. Look at your luncheon companion, look at your menu, but don't look down. You're only feeding your fears when you do that. "
"Marjorie: Maybe I wasn't ready for a window table. "
"Frasier: No, no, no. Of course you are, of course you are. You can beat this thing. "
"Marjorie: You're right, I can, Dr. Crane, if I just... [she screams again] "
"Frasier: Do not look down "
"Marjorie: No, I didn't. My check just came. "
"Frasier: Oh, well, Marjorie, we're just about out of time now. Call me tomorrow, will you? Well, that's it for today folks. Stay tuned for Bob “Bulldog” Briscoe. This is Dr. Frasier Crane, KACL 780, talk radio. "
"Bulldog: Hey, Doc. "
"Frasier: Bulldog. "
"Bulldog: I caught the first hour of your show today. If that chick whining about sexual harassment called my show, I'd say “Listen doll, you don't want people snapping your bra, don't wear one.” "
"Frasier: Brilliant in its simplicity. "
"Bulldog: Hey, how's this sound, "
"hardbody: You, me, Sonics, Nicks, tonight. "
"Roz: Sorry Bulldog, but I'm already going. I have season tickets. "
"Bulldog: Oh, we can still get together afterwards. "
"Roz: Only if I smash into your car in the parking lot. "
"Bulldog: Why is it the ones who want it the most put up the biggest struggle? "
"Roz: Because, when I do finally give in, I want us to enjoy it all the more. "
"Roz: That is, if I'm not too distracted by the fact that every man on Earth has died. "
"Bulldog: Almost had her there. "
"Frasier: Yes, it could have gone either way. "
"Bulldog: Ah, well, with my pull I can get those anytime I want. "
"Niles: Hello, Frasier. "
"Frasier: Oh, oh, Bulldog, have you met my brother Niles? Niles, this is Bulldog Briscoe. "
"Niles: Oh, oh, oh, just the man I want to talk to. As a sports expert I'm sure you can tell me why none of the local media carry the Ivy League squash standings. "
"Bulldog: Whoa Another one just like you. Some gypsy put a curse on your family? Well, I gotta run. See you later, Miles. "
"Niles: It's, it's Niles. "
"Bulldog: Like it matters. "
"Niles: Well, you ready for our boys night out at La Cochan Noir? "
"Frasier: Yes. But Niles, I've been "
"wondering: Would you mind if I asked Dad to join us? "
"Niles: Remember the last time we took Dad to a four-star restaurant? He had a miserable time. The restaurant lost a whole star. "
"Frasier: Yes, it's just I'm trying desperately to come up with some way to get him out of the house. He's off on one of his “Weeping Lotus” binges again. "
"Niles: We've tried distracting him before. We've taken him everywhere from the arboretum to the zen garden. Wait a minute, the zen garden is at the arboretum. Good lord, is it possible we've only taken him one place? "
"Frasier: Oh, Niles, Niles, this is it, this is it. The basketball game "
"Niles: Basketball? "
"Frasier: Yes, yes, I can get another ticket from the promotional department. Oh, this is perfect. Just imagine how excited Dad will be to go to a game with his two sons. My God, it's the archetypal male bonding ritual "
"Niles: Couldn't we just go into the woods, kill something and have done with it? All right. "
"Frasier: Come on Niles, look, it'll give you a chance to see the Tacoma Dome. "
"Niles: I've already seen it. They had a home show there, once. You know, that's where I got that idea to stencil a grape arbor on our Wilkes dresser. "
"Frasier: I'm a Teamster compared to you. "
"Salesman: Peanuts Peanuts here, peanuts "
"Martin: Niles, the game is that way. "
"Niles: I know, I'm just calculating our escape routes in case of fire or urban unrest. Maris taught me that. "
"Martin: You love her, don't you? "
"Niles: Yes I do. Why? "
"Martin: It just helps to know that. "
"Frasier: Here we "
"are: one beer, and two glasses of wine. I'm sure it's good, Niles, they opened a fresh box when they poured it. "
"Martin: What are you guys doin' drinkin' wine at a ball game? You should be drinkin' beer. "
"Niles: Dad, I only drink beer when I eat German food. Which is to say, never. Did you notice where the facilities are when you were up? "
"Frasier: Yes, Niles, it's just as you "
"feared: communal urinals in the mens room. "
"Niles: Oh, fine. What am I supposed to do about my shy kidneys? "
"Frasier: So, Dad, aren't these great seats, huh? "
"Martin: Yeah. "
"Frasier: What's the matter with you? "
"Martin: Uh, nothin'. Let me borrow your pen a minute, will ya? "
"Frasier: What for? "
"Martin: Well, I was thinking about that ballistics report and I just want to make a note so I won't forget it. "
"Frasier: Dad, the whole idea of coming here tonight was to get your mind off of the case. Listen I've done some reading. It seems the key for the Sonics is to stop Starts from penetrating and dumping the ball off for easy baskets. "
"Niles: Stop Starts? That sounds funny. Stop Starts. Stop Starts, stopstarts, stopstarts... "
"Frasier: Oh, shut up, Niles "
"Martin: It makes no sense. "
"Frasier: Well, Dad, it's not my theory, I'm just quoting some sports writer. "
"Martin: No, I mean Helen. She was tall. She was five feet seven. Yet the bullet entered on a downward trajectory. "
"Frasier: Dad, please try to participate. Ooh, look They're starting the wave Ooh, it's coming this way, it's coming this way "
"Frasier: That was fun, wasn't it? Oh, look, there's a peanut guy Peanuts "
"Niles: How dare you Stop it That hooligan is pelting me with peanuts From the look of that tray, he's come prepared. Stop it "
"Frasier: Stop it, that is for me "
"Martin: I gotta go make a call. "
"Frasier: Oh, Dad, this isn't about the case, is it? "
"Martin: Yeah. "
"Frasier: Well, Dad, look, you've been working on it for twenty years, how come you're so obsessed now? "
"Martin: Look, when Helen was murdered, I made a promise to her mother. I said that no matter how long it took, I'd find the killer. Well, I had a call from her last week, and she's an old lady now, living in a home somewhere and, I don't know, she just doesn't seem to have a lot longer to go, and it just kind of lit a fire under me to get this thing solved. So, I appreciate your bringing me here, but I gotta make this call. I'll be back in a couple of minutes. [He gets up to go to the phones.] "
"Frasier: Okay, Dad. I understand. "
"Fan: Boy, the traffic tonight is murder. Hey pal, what's the score? "
"Niles: West Side Story. "
"Martin: You know what's always bugged me? This picture of the crime scene. The way Helen's written “help.” Why would she do that? "
"Daphne: Well, I suppose the word “howdy” would have been a bit too cheery under the circumstances. "
"Martin: But it makes no "
"sense: anybody who could read “help” in the dirt could also see Helen lying there. "
"Frasier: Evening, Dad. "
"Niles: Hey, Dad. "
"Martin: Oh, listen, thanks again for the ball game. It was great. "
"Frasier: Oh, God, it was a pleasure, Dad. I'm only sorry you couldn't join us for dinner afterwards. La Cochan Noir gave us a late seating for a fabulous dinner. "
"Niles: It was an exquisite meal, marred only by the lack of even one outstanding cognac on their carte d' vijastite. "
"Frasier: Yes, but think of it this way, "
"Niles: what is the one thing better than an exquisite meal? An exquisite meal with one tiny flaw we can pick at all night. "
"Niles: Ah... quite right. To impossible standards. [They clink glasses.] "
"Frasier: So, Dad, any progress on the case? "
"Martin: Nah, I'm beat. Sometimes it's better to just get a good night's sleep and start fresh in the morning. Good night, fellas. "
"Frasier: Night, Dad. "
"Niles: Don't "
"forget: brush your teeth and say your prayers. "
"Martin: That's what I used to say to you guys when you were kids, didn't I? "
"Frasier: No, you didn't. "
"Martin: Oh. I meant to. "
"Niles: We knew that. "
"Daphne: Hello. "
"Niles: Hello, Daphne "
"Daphne: How was your dinner? "
"Niles: It was fine, except for one small flaw. "
"Daphne: Oh, just the way you like it. I see you're a bit intrigued by that yourself. "
"Frasier: Yes, well it's been a while since I've gone over this. Who are these guys? "
"Daphne: Oh, just some of the principal players in our little drama. That's Detective Shelby, the vice cop who found the body. "
"Niles: Who is this menacing little mono-brow? "
"Daphne: Oh, that's Robbethai, a logger. An ex-boyfriend of Helen's. He used to come down from the mountains every couple of months and disappear with her. "
"Niles: If you ask me, he's the murderer. "
"Daphne: Impossible, he's got an air-tight alibi. "
"Niles: What is it? "
"Daphne: He was killing somebody else at the time. But you have to admit, this case has it "
"all: sex, greed, jealousy, revenge, a monkey, hatred, deception... "
"Frasier: Wait, wait, wait... "
"Daphne: What? "
"Frasier: A monkey? "
"Niles: Yeah. This is a snapshot of the murder victim with her pet monkey, Koko. He was given to her by another boyfriend, Clive Brisbane. "
"Frasier: Well, why wasn't Brisbane a suspect? "
"Daphne: Well, he was, but several witnesses saw him at the racetrack at the time of the murder. "
"Niles: Excuse me, is that Clive Brisbane the animal trainer? "
"Daphne: That's right. Brisbane's Amazing Apes. They opened in Las Vegas for Englebert Humperdink. "
"Frasier: Yes, it's easy to forget there was a time when Las Vegas wasn't the tacky place it is now. "
"Niles: You know, I actually caught Brisbane's act on a trip to Las Vegas during college. Those apes were amazing One minute, they'd be staging a living tableaux of George Washington crossing the Delaware, the next they'd be shooting suction cup arrows at Brisbane's lovely assistant's derriere. "
"Frasier: You know, there is a way that Brisbane could be the killer, and still have his horse track alibi hold up. Daphne, Niles, I present you with... the killer [He turns around a photo of a chimpanzee.] "
"Daphne: A monkey was the trigger man? "
"Frasier: Just play along with me here. They're capable of shooting arrows, why not a gun? "
"Daphne: But why would Brisbane have her killed? "
"Frasier: Because, because she jilted him for someone else. "
"Daphne: Robbethai, the logger "
"Frasier: Exactly My God, we've done it "
"Daphne: No, you've done it, Dr. Crane "
"Frasier: Well, yes But you were standing very close by. Wait a minute. Are we saying here that a murder was committed by a monkey? "
"Niles: It's not so very farfetched It could be Brisbane's diabolical homage to the Edgar Allan Poe story “Murders in the Rue Morgue.” It's all about an orangutan who goes about the rooftops of Paris murdering people. Wait 'til we tell Dad his case has finally been solved Dad Dad "
"Frasier: No. Niles, Niles, wait, wait. It's still just a theory. Even if we are right, just think how Dad would feel, knowing we cracked a case he couldn't solve in twenty years. "
"Daphne: Oh, dear, you're right. "
"Frasier: Wait. It's merely serendipity that I stumbled into this. Why can't it happen again? I simply rearrange the photos in a way that Dad will see the connection. All right, we've got Koko, the gun, and Helen. "
"Martin: What is it? No, hey, Frasier What are you doin' over there? "
"Frasier: Sorry Dad. "
"Martin: No, no, no, I got these all set out the way I want 'em. This one goes up... "
"Martin: I'll be damned. "
"Frasier: Something wrong? "
"Martin: Look at that "
"Frasier: What? "
"Martin: Well, I never thought it would just leap out and bite me like this. I think I may have solved this pain in the ass case. "
"Niles: You have? "
"Frasier: Dad, Dad, that's wonderful news "
"Martin: Oh, no, no. Don't get too excited. I mean, this is kind of farfetched. I mean, it's a long shot, but, it's beginning to make sense to me. "
"Frasier: Here, lay it all out for us. "
"Martin: No, no guys, please, just give me a little privacy, will ya? I just gotta do some thinking. "
"Niles: No problem, Dad. "
"Daphne: I was just going to bed meself. Night, all. "
"Niles: Goodnight, Daphne. "
"Niles: Oh, look at him. Do you see the sparkle in his eye? Oh, Frasier, he's like a little kid at Christmas. "
"Martin: Oh, geez, what happened to my entry wound close-ups? "
"Frasier: Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la "
"Frasier: Hello Daphne. "
"Daphne: Hello. "
"Frasier: Is Dad home? "
"Daphne: Nope, I haven't seen him since he knocked me up early this morning. "
"Frasier: What? "
"Daphne: Knocked me up. Woke me up. It's an English expression. What does it mean here? "
"Frasier: Oh, something else. You'd definitely be awake for it, though. "
"Daphne: He was headed down to the station house to present his theory. "
"Frasier: Oh, dear God, I wish he hadn't done that. You know, I've been turning it over in my mind all day. The more I think about it, the goofier it sounds. I mean, a MONKEY. Let's hope they didn't laugh him out of the station, be one hell of way to end a thirty year police career. "
"Daphne: Oh, now, now, Dr. Crane, it's not the most outlandish theory in the world. "
"Frasier: You're right, I could have said it was a trained giraffe. I suppose it killed her by spitting a bullet at her, thus explaining the downward trajectory. "
"Martin: Hey, guys. "
"Daphne: Hello. "
"Frasier: Hi, Dad. "
"Martin: I don't suppose we've heard anything from the station house, huh? "
"Daphne: Not yet. "
"Martin: I was afraid of that. I mean I knew my theory was a bit iffy, but when I told the guys they looked at me like I’d lost my mind. "
"Frasier: Geez, they didn't ridicule you, did they? "
"Martin: Oh, no, they always treat old timers with respect. They said “I'll check it out.” Just like I used to when some nutbag'd come in there with aluminum foil in his hat claiming the Martians were trying to steal his brain waves. "
"Daphne: I'm sorry, Mr. Crane. "
"Martin: Oh, I don't know what I was thinking of. I've been walking around all afternoon just trying to figure out how I came up with such a half-assed theory. "
"Frasier: Dad, it wasn't your fault. I did it. "
"Martin: You killed her? "
"Frasier: No. But I did plant that ridiculous idea in your head. Remember last night when you came in, so upset that I was rearranging your pictures? Well, I rearranged them in a specific way so that you would... come to the same conclusion I did. "
"Martin: So you had the idea first? "
"Frasier: I can't tell you how terrible I feel. "
"Martin: Ah, don't blame yourself. You might have put the aluminum foil in my hat, but I walked right into the station wearin' it. "
"Daphne: I'll get it. "
"Frank: Hiya, Marty. "
"Martin: Hey, Frank. Frasier, Daphne, you remember Frank Hollings from the precinct? "
"Frank: Hey Marty, we gotta talk. "
"Martin: Frank, about that theory of mine... "
"Frank: I can't for the life of me figure what you were thinking. "
"Martin: I know, I know. I just feel so stupid, wasting your time. "
"Frank: It cost us a whole afternoon, and five detectives' time. And all we got to show for it is... heh, heh, we got the bastard "
"Martin: I was right? "
"Frank: Hey, you don't believe me, ask these derelicts. "
"Martin: “Hey Way to go, Marty” “And it only took you twenty years” "
"Daphne: Oh, Mr. Crane, I'm so proud of you. "
"Frasier: Oh, that's amazing, that's wonderful [as a man spills beer on the couch] Oh, that's suede "
"Cop: So Marty, how did you do it? "
"Martin: Well, you know, for years, I thought it was Robbethai, the logger. And then I thought, well, maybe it was Brisbane the animal trainer, but I was wrong. "
"Frank: How did you finally decide that it was Detective Shelby? "
"Martin: Well, I kept lookin' at that picture, and it kept buggin' me, you know? Why was she trying to write “help” in the dirt and then it came to me She was trying to write the killer's name, “Shelby.” Only she must've died before she finished the “b” and, and somebody must've kicked dirt over the “s.” "
"Frank: Well, you nailed him all right. We pulled him in for interrogation and he cracked like a nut. "
"Daphne: Oh, I'm sorry I ever doubted you. But, then, you yourself were beginning to wonder if a monkey could really commit a murder. "
"Frasier: Well, I may have momentarily doubted it, but from time to time I have to be reminded to trust my gift. "
"Martin: So, did you call the girl's mother yet? "
"Frank: Nah, we left that for you. After all, you were the guy who solved this thing. "
"Martin: Ah, well, actually, I can't take all the credit for it, right Frasier? Come on, get over here. "
"Frasier: Now, now, Dad. "
"Martin: Nah, come on, don't be shy. I'm proud of ya. You know, I was a cop for thirty years and it took my son with his Ph.D. mind to crack this baby. "
"Daphne: Of course, I was standing next to him at the time. "
"Frank: So, tell us about it, Frasier. "
"Frasier: Oh, no. "
"Frasier: All right, I hate to toot my own horn, but, if it will make Dad happy. I suppose it was my expertise in human behavior, combined with a lifelong enthusiasm for the Rwandan lowland gorilla that first set me thinking about the monkey. "
"Frank: I'm not sure I'm following you. "
"Frasier: Perhaps I'm going too fast, I'll go slower. The key was when I figured out if Brisbane could teach a monkey to impersonate George Washington, then surely he could teach a monkey to cock a revolver, sneak up a fire escape, lie in wait for Helen, pump her full of lead and then make his getaway, perhaps even still wearing the revolutionary war regalia in order to confuse any chance witnesses. In fact, oh and this is way out there, but geez, maybe you should check to see if there were any local bank robberies at the time that were committed by a short, hairy man wearing a powdered wig. "
"Martin: You think the monkey was the killer? "
"Daphne: When I said I was standing next to him, I was really most of the way across the room. "
"Frasier: Well, wasn't he? "
"Martin: No, it was Shelby. "
"Frasier: Who's Shelby? "
"Martin: He was a vice cop. He was in love with Helen. "
"Frasier: Oh. Well, that was my second choice. "
"Frasier: Can I freshen anyone's drink? "
"Frank: Help me out here, Frasier. What did you think the monkey's motive was? Jealousy? Or maybe he just did it for the insurance money. "
"Cop: Hey, hey, hey. Do you think we should put a tail on that monkey? "
"Another: If that monkey did it, he'll swing for this. "
"Frasier: Yes, yes, that's all very funny. "
"Martin: Oh, come on, Frasier you can take a joke, can't you? "
"Frasier: Well, I suppose I can, yes. Oh, wait I've got one. Who do you suppose the monkey will get to defend him? Clarence Darrow? "
"Frasier: The Scopes Monkey trial... You know, Darwin's theory of evolution... It was turned into a Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, “Inherit the Wind.” Is that gun loaded? "

"Niles: Allow me. "
"Niles: You're welcome. When did everyone become so boorish? Honestly, sometimes I think I'm the only person left in the world with any sense of refinement. Ooh Ooh Smell my hands "
"Frasier: Thank you, no. "
"Niles: I'm just so proud. I had to stop for gas, and I pumped it myself It's part of a new kick I'm on. "
"Frasier: Which is what? "
"Niles: I'm learning to be handy. I've decided I depend too much on other people, so I'm doing it myself. Ooh, feel that. Tell me that's not the start of a first-rate callus. "
"Roz: Frasier, you left this in your booth. "
"Frasier: Oh dear, thank you Roz. "
"Niles: What is it? "
"Frasier: Oh, it's a tape Dad asked me to rent for him. It's part of our new Wednesday night ritual. Dad mixes up a pot of his five-alarm chili, we all curl up on the couch and watch an Angie Dickinson movie and I wish I were dead. You should join us. "
"Niles: No, no. I got my first work shirt this morning and tonight I'm tackling the squeaky hasp on my cigar humidor. "
"Frasier: Oh, well, be sure to wear your hernia belt. So, Roz, you gonna join us? "
"Roz: No, I think I'll just go sit over here. "
"Niles: Roz? Are you trying to avoid me? "
"Roz: Well, can you blame me? I mean, it took you nearly a year just to learn my name and every time we sit together, you have some kind of snide remark to make. "
"Niles: Name one. "
"Roz: Well, last week you told me my bedroom was easier to get into than a community college. "
"Niles: I was hoping that would be the one you'd name. "
"Roz: You know, I've got half a mind to... "
"Frasier: No, no, no Just hold on now, Roz. You and Niles got off on the wrong foot a long time ago. I think if you two sat down and had a real conversation you'd hit it off famously. Here, you sit, Roz, and I will go and get your coffee. "
"Niles: So, how are you? "
"Roz: Fine. You? "
"Niles: Great. So...that's a nice jacket. "
"Roz: Thank you. "
"Niles: Offbeat. "
"Roz: And what is that supposed to mean, 'offbeat'? "
"Niles: Well... "
"Roz: No, wait, I think I know exactly what it means. Offbeat as in cheap. Well, excuse me for not being rich enough to shop at the International House of Tight-Ass like you and Maris the heiress That is what you meant, right? "
"Niles: Yes... but I had no idea you'd pick up on it "
"Roz: Then you were insulting me. "
"Niles: Yes, but you got in a couple of good shots yourself. "
"Roz: I did, didn't I? I'm so glad we did this "
"Frasier: You know, sometimes I am such a good therapist, I scare myself Oh my goodness... where's my briefcase? "
"Niles: Didn't you put it under your chair? "
"Frasier: Well, yes I did, but someone must have taken it "
"Niles: Frasier, look, there it is "
"Frasier: Excuse me. "
"Man: Excuse me. "
"Frasier: Is that your briefcase? "
"Man: Yes, it is. "
"Frasier: Where did you get it? "
"Man: Some of the nuns in my parish bought it for me as a gift. "
"Frasier: Ah, your parish? Then that would make you a priest? "
"Man: Yes. "
"Frasier: Well, then, 'Father' , perhaps you'd like to explain why you'd be carrying around... [opens the case]...a Bible and some rosary beads? [slams the case shut] "
"Man: What exactly are you looking for? "
"Frasier: An Angie Dickinson movie. I loaned it to the Monsignor. He was supposed to give it to you to give to me. Apparently he forgot. Well, it's a two-day rental anyway, doesn't matter. Off you go. Thank you. "
"Niles: I'm sorry, Frasier. It looked exactly like yours. They both have the same inferior leather. "
"Roz: I gave him that briefcase "
"Niles: I know "
"Frasier: Yes, I would mind holding again Look, I've already held three times I'm simply trying to report a few stolen credit cards, but every five seconds...damn it [He notices Eddie staring] Don't stare at me, Eddie. I'm a humane man, but right now I could kick a kitten through an electric fan "
"Martin: So, Niles called. Somebody stole your briefcase, huh? "
"Frasier: Yes, all right, Dad, go ahead; tell me how stupid I was to get taken advantage of that way. It's certainly better than listening to 'Jumping Jack Flash' arranged for piano and flute. "
"Martin: I don't think it was stupid. These guys are pros. They just need a second and bam, they're out the door. "
"Frasier: Well, that's rather refreshing. I was expecting you to call me every name from a naive dupe to a... "
"Martin: Bone-headed rube? "
"Frasier: But you're not "
"Martin: No, I'm not. The important thing is you learned a lesson. You got to keep your guard up. The world would be a happier place if everybody would remember two little "
"words: People stink. "
"Frasier: I'm sorry, but that's just a little cynical for me I don't want to go through life thinking the worst of people. I prefer to think of them as basically good and decent. [into phone] Yes, I am here, but you know, I'm sorry, I'm in the middle of a speech right now, so you'll have to hold Truth is, I enjoy my life that way. If the price I have to pay is to replace a few credit cards from time to time, well then, so be it. "
"Daphne: This whole thing reminds me of when I first moved to London. I was very mistrusting of people back then. I was convinced the way to stay out of harm's way was to walk straight with me eyes cast down, never meeting anyone's glance. But, finally, I decided that was no way to live. So one day, I just lifted up my chin and took it all in. Well, the change was amazing. There were sights I'd never seen, sounds I'd never heard. A tiny old man came up to me with a note in his hand. He needed help. I realized this was no city full of thieves and muggers. There were people here who needed me. I took his note, read it, and to this day, I can remember just what I said to that "
"Man: 'That's not how you spell ‘fellatio.’' "
"Frasier: So... whose point did she prove? "
"Martin: I have no idea. "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Well, I can't tell you how much fun it's been chatting with you all today, nasty old Gertrude aside. But, I'd like to close the show with a personal message. This goes out to the person who stole my briefcase yesterday. And, as it turns out, also stole my dry cleaning this morning with the claim ticket that was inside. You need help, and I am here to provide it. Oh, also, the double-breasted navy blue suit was meant to be worn with French cuffs and medium heel wing tips. You may be sick, but there's no reason why you shouldn't be stylish. Until tomorrow, this is Dr. Frasier Crane. "
"Roz: Man, that was a great show It was better than great - it was brilliant. I can't remember when you were more... "
"Frasier: What do you want? "
"Roz: Okay. Remember, I told you my girlfriend was coming to town and I might need Friday off? "
"Frasier: No. "
"Roz: No, you don't remember, or no, I can't have Friday off? "
"Frasier: Take one of each, I'm feeling generous. "
"Frasier: Hello? "
"Man: Hi, is this Dr. Crane? "
"Frasier: Yes, it is. "
"Man: Oh man, what a thrill I can't believe I got through "
"Frasier: Yes, well, actually, my show is over. You'll have to call in again tomorrow. "
"Man: That's not why I'm calling. I think I found your briefcase. "
"Frasier: Oh, really? Really, are you sure? "
"Man: Pretty sure. "
"Frasier: Well, there's a way we can be positive. Simply turn over the briefcase and in the upper right-hand corner you should find a half-moon-shaped watermark, such as would be left by the careless resting of a champagne flute. "
"Man: It's full of your stuff, Dr. Crane. "
"Frasier: Oh. Well, that works as well, yes. Say, listen, is everything still there? "
"Man: Well, there's a nice gold pen, a set of car keys, a date book... "
"Frasier: What about my wallet? "
"Man: Oh, sorry. "
"Frasier: Well, I suppose that was asking for too much. Well, how can I get it back? "
"Man: I could drop it off. "
"Frasier: Oh, better yet, why don't you meet me at the Café Nervosa on Pike and Third. I'd be glad to give you a reward. "
"Man: Hey, meeting you is reward enough Half an hour okay? "
"Frasier: That's perfect. Bye. "
"Man: Bye. "
"Roz: Well, that was pretty great. "
"Frasier: Yes, but not surprising. Haven't I always told you to have faith in people? "
"Roz: Yes, and you were right. People are basically good. "
"Frasier: Yes. "
"Roz: And fair. "
"Frasier: Indeed. "
"Roz: We do nice things for people in this world because there's a little thing called karma... "
"Frasier: There's no way you're getting Friday off. "
"TO: "
"Niles: Allow me. "
"Niles: Do you believe that woman? That's the second time that's happened to me this week. I have half a mind to say something. "
"Frasier: Well, then why don't you? "
"Niles: Oh, you know. Something happens to me when I talk to a beautiful woman. From the moment they begin staring into my eyes my knees turn to jelly. "
"Frasier: Still, Niles, we both know the only way to break people off their bad habits is by confronting them. "
"Niles: Oh, that's true. "
"Frasier: So? "
"Waiter: Who's next here? "
"Woman: I am I'll have a cafe... "
"Niles: Oh, oh, oh, oh No, you're not You weren't next here, I am I suppose people like you who glide through life wrapped in a cozy little cocoon of narcissism never notice such things. But you'd do well to learn this lesson, sister There's still such a thing as good manners in this world, and that's why I would like to insist that you let me buy you your coffee and also please try the poppy seed muffins. "
"Woman: Thank you. "
"Niles: You're welcome. "
"Frasier: Kind of brutal, weren't you? "
"Niles: All I remember was, I was next and then the sound of blood thundering through my ears. "
"Frasier: There, there, Niles. Soon you'll be home with Maris and you'll forget you were anywhere near a beautiful woman today. Please, why don't we sit here by the window so we can see him when he comes? "
"Niles: Oh, your good Samaritan? "
"Frasier: Yes. You know, I have to tell you Niles, I'm feeling rather good about this whole thing. Granted, I did lose my wallet and my favorite suit. But, still, mostly everything else was intact. My date book, my spare set of car keys, my fountain pen. But, best of all, what has remained intact is my sense that people are basically trustworthy. "
"Niles: Frasier, the person who has your car keys asked you to meet him here, knowing you'd bring your car? "
"Frasier: Now, now... before you launch into one of your little paranoid riffs, my car happens to be...[looks out the window] MOVING DOWN THE STREET "
"Frasier: Oh my god Stop Stop that well-dressed man "
"Martin: Yeah, Charlie, it's my son Frasier's car. So, if you could put a little extra manpower on this, I'd appreciate it. Yeah, I know. I know, fell for that old scam. [Niles exits to the kitchen] I told him you gotta keep your guard up, but you know Frasier, he always knows better - Mr. Up With People. Yeah, remember what we used to call guys like him when I was on the force? Hey, we're still talking about my son here, Charlie Yeah, I'll talk to you. "
"Martin: Hi Frasier, how's it going? "
"Frasier: Terribly. Guess what happened today? "
"Martin: What? "
"Frasier: My car was stolen "
"Martin: You're kidding "
"Frasier: Yes, once again, I fell victim to a master criminal. "
"Martin: How'd they do it? Hot-wire it? Boy, you know, those guys got fingers like concert pianists. "
"Frasier: No. He had the key. "
"Martin: Oh, a real pro, huh? He made a wax impression and then had a duplicate key made? "
"Frasier: No... It was the same miscreant who stole my briefcase. He used the spare set that was inside. "
"Martin: What? He tailed you for a few days, learned your routine, so he'd know where to find the car? "
"Frasier: Not exactly. He called the station and we agreed to meet. "
"Martin: What for? "
"Niles: Low-fat lattes and biscotti. "
"Frasier: Oh, what are you, the town crier? Oh, go ahead and laugh You know, it still doesn't shake my belief in the basic goodness of people. "
"Martin: Well, sure. He's probably using your car to deliver hot meals to shut-ins. "
"Frasier: Yes, well, I'm glad that my misfortune has given you two so much glee But Dad, I have two requests. First, wipe that father-knows-best smirk off of your face I am not a child "
"Martin: And, what's the second request? "
"Frasier: Can I borrow your car? I want to go to the movies. "
"TO: "
"Frasier: And last stop on our tour, my booth. Where all the magic happens. "
"Roz: Hey Daphne, what are you doing here? "
"Daphne: Oh, Dr. Crane needed a lift in, so I decided to come up for a little tour. Oh, don't mind me. Just go on about your business. "
"Daphne: It's not like... I'm listening. "
"Roz: Have we had one visitor yet who didn't feel the need to do that? "
"Frasier: Thank you for the ride down, Daphne, but we do have a show to do. So if you... "
"Daphne: You know, people are always telling me I have a natural talent for this. "
"Frasier: Yes, yes, of course. Your soothing voice, your calming manner. I could listen to you for hours. "
"Daphne: Oh, wow, do you really think so? "
"Frasier: Oh, yes. Absolutely. All right, now get out. [shoves her out the door.] "
"Frasier: Roz, could you get that, please? "
"Roz: Sure. Hello? Who's calling please? Just a second. It's Denise. She said she was out with you last night. "
"Frasier: I wasn't out with anyone named Denise last night. "
"Roz: Ooh... speaker phone, speaker phone "
"Frasier: Oh, all right. Hello. This is Frasier Crane. "
"Denise: Hey, tiger. I miss you already. "
"Frasier: I beg your pardon? "
"Denise: Oh, I'm sorry to call you at work, but you just snuck out of here this morning without giving me your number and I woke up to see your BMW pulling down my driveway. "
"Frasier: You did? "
"Denise: Mm-hmm. But I'm not mad. How can I be after the best first night I ever spent with a man? "
"Frasier: Denise, could you just hold on for a moment? "
"Denise: Sure. "
"Frasier: Do you realize what this means? "
"Roz: The guy who stole your stuff told her he was you. "
"Frasier: And it worked She slept with him on the first date Nobody ever sleeps with me on the first date [takes phone off hold] Hi, it's me again. "
"Denise: Look, I'm sorry to do this on short notice, but I won't be able to meet you for that drink at Alberto's. The agency called. They booked me for a swimsuit layout. "
"Denise: Oh, there's my cab. I'll call you tomorrow. Kisses "
"Roz: Unbelievable "
"Frasier: Yes. Apparently he wasn't content just to steal my possessions. Now he's after my identity as well "
"Roz: I'm calling the police. "
"Frasier: No, Roz, no I will handle this myself. I am going down to Alberto's. "
"Roz: You have a show "
"Frasier: Just run something from the 'Best of Frasier Crane.' This jackal thinks he's meeting Denise down there, but he's going to meet me instead "
"Roz: Are you crazy? He could be dangerous "
"Frasier: I don't care, Roz My god, this man's gone too far. He's after my very soul now What was it Shakespeare wrote? 'He who steals my purse steals trash. But he who steals my good name steals...' Well... oh, I forget the rest, but it makes me good and mad "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Excuse me. Have you seen a man in here wearing an impeccably tailored Italian suit? "
"Heather: Just you. "
"Frasier: Oh, well... thank you. Giorgio Armani. "
"Heather: Nice to meet you, Giorgio. My name's Heather. "
"Frasier: Yes, uh, Frasier Crane, it's a pleasure. [gestures to a barstool next to her] Do you mind? "
"Heather: Wait a minute. Dr. Frasier Crane from the radio? "
"Frasier: Yes. "
"Heather: Well, I've heard your show. You're great "
"Frasier: Oh, thank you. "
"Heather: This is exciting Hey, didn't you say on your show the other day that someone had impersonated you at the dry cleaners? "
"Frasier: Yes, someone did. "
"Heather: But, how do I know that you're not the impersonator? "
"Frasier: Oh, good heavens, if you're looking for identification, I... Uh-oh. "
"Heather: I thought so. "
"Frasier: Yes, but, he stole my wallet the other day. "
"Heather: Who did? "
"Frasier: Frasier did - the bad Frasier. "
"Heather: You're pretty sick, you know that? Maybe you ought to just get a life "
"Frasier: Heather, this is absurd Can't you recognize my... "
"Frasier: Nice suit. "
"Phil: Oh my god, it's you "
"Frasier: Oh, no you don't You're mine now "
"Phil: All right. All right, I give up. "
"Frasier: Damn it How did you find me? "
"Frasier: Well, a certain Denise called the station today. She had to cancel your little rendezvous. "
"Phil: Great. And I put on my best suit. "
"Frasier: No. You put on my best suit "
"Phil: Well, I guess this is it. Party's over. I'm so stupid [sits at a table] You probably want to call the police, huh? "
"Frasier: No. What I would like to do is throttle you until your eyes shoot across the room like champagne corks But I won't, because this is still a civilized world. But it won't be for long if you lowlifes have your way, because with every wallet you steal, you put bars on someone else's windows With every purse you snatch, you put mace on another key chain Everyday you make our lives a little less livable, and I hope that burns on your conscience Well, what do you have to say for yourself? "
"Phil: You're right. "
"Frasier: Oh, oh... I see. I see. You think by agreeing with me, I'll let you off the hook. "
"Phil: No, I'm saying you're right. I'm not trying to weasel out of this. I'm guilty and I deserve what I get. Look, here's your keys. The car's out front with your briefcase in it. [pulls out a cell phone] Here, go ahead and call the police. That's your new car phone, by the way. I upgraded. I should have known things were gonna turn out like this for me. "
"Frasier: Oh yes, here it comes - the old sob story. 'Daddy didn't love me. Mother ignored me. The bully next door stole my baseball glove.' "
"Phil: No Dad loved me. Mom spoiled me. And I was the bully next door. Say, why don't you let me do that, it's kind of tricky. "
"Frasier: Thank you. "
"Phil: There's only one person to blame for my problems and that's me. Yeah, hi. The number for the Seattle P.D., please. I take the easy way out of everything, I always have. And you want to know why? I'm lazy. Lazy, lazy, lazy Oh, sweetheart, I don't have the energy to look for a pencil. Could you just connect me? Thanks, hon. "
"Frasier: You expect me to believe that your entire life of crime can be attributed to your laziness? "
"Phil: Hey, it's the truth. I don't like to work, never have. And believe me, it's a lot easier to take something than to get a job. And I'm even a lazy criminal A briefcase here, a set of car keys there. Maybe a little light shoplifting, but a bank robbery? All that planning and split-second timing? Forget it And that second-story stuff - the grappling hooks, glass cutters... who does that? Yeah, thank you. You're on hold. "
"Frasier: Story of my week. You know, you seem to be taking this awfully well. "
"Phil: Well, it's like I said. It was bound to happen. "
"Frasier: Or perhaps... perhaps you wanted to get caught. "
"Phil: Huh? "
"Frasier: Yes, well, think about it. You've been taking greater and greater risks. Isn't that the behavior of a man who wants to get caught? "
"Phil: I'm telling ya, Doc - lazy Look at your pants, for god's sake You'd think I'd take them in to be hemmed, right? Staples "
"Frasier: Oh, dear god "
"Phil: Staples "
"Frasier: Well, I still say that you really wanted to get caught. It's a classic cri de couer. "
"Phil: Cri de what? "
"Frasier: Well, it's a ballet, it... it just means that you don't like the life that you're living. "
"Phil: Well, it's not a great life. Half the time I don't know where my next month's rent is coming from. And I haven't been in a solid relationship in I don't know how long. "
"Frasier: Then why don't you change? "
"Phil: Haven't we been over this? Gimme an 'L', gimme an 'A'... "
"Frasier: As a psychiatrist, I just don't buy that. You're not lazy. What you are is afraid. There are any number of things you could do in a legitimate world. You're just afraid to try one of them and fail at it. "
"Phil: You really think I can change? "
"Frasier: Yes. I believe everyone can change because I believe in the basic goodness of people. Oh yes, hello. Yes, uh...just a moment, please. Start now. Take responsibility for yourself. For once, don't take the easy way out. "
"Phil: Hello. Yeah, I'd like to report a crime. "
"Heather: There he is. He's the man who's been impersonating Frasier Crane. "
"Officer: All right, let's go. "
"Frasier: Oh, what are you talking about? I am Frasier Crane "
"Officer: Do you have identification? "
"Frasier: Well, no... no. But it's the truth Tell them. "
"Phil: Thank god you got here when you did, officer I detained him as long as I could "
"Frasier: What? "
"Officer: Move it "
"Frasier: But he's lying He's the imposter Don't you people recognize me? "
"Frasier: Oh, for goodness sake This is madness I can't believe this is happening People of the world, listen to me Trust no one, especially THAT lazy bastard "

"Frasier: Dad, when a man has no front teeth and stitches on his nose, I think it's safe to assume he's sensitive to criticism. "
"Martin: What's this? "
"Frasier: Oh, must be one of those inspirational tapes that Daphne's always listening to. Oh, my God, “Here, Have a Rainbow,” by Dr. Honey Snow. Daphne, how can you listen to this stuff ? It's absolute drivel. "
"Daphne: Well, for someone who writes drivel, she's awfully popular. "
"Frasier: Oh, really, fancy that. She tells everyone that they're perfectly wonderful and that nothing wrong is ever their fault. What do you know, they like it. "
"Daphne: There's a lot more to it than that. You should try reading one of her books. "
"Frasier: Yes, well I have. Believe me, after one page, I was yearning for the worldly cynicism of Barney the Dinosaur. "
"Frasier: Hello, Niles, to what do we owe this pleasure? "
"Niles: Brace yourselves kids, it's raffle time "
"Frasier: Oh, God. "
"Martin: Not again. "
"Niles: ‘Fraid so. Oh ye gods, who's been plumbing the shallows of Dr. Honey Snow? "
"Daphne: I have. "
"Niles: Insightful, isn't she? Anyway, tickets are only ten dollars, it all goes to support Maris's little opera group. "
"Frasier: Dear God, what is the grand prize this year? "
"Niles: Their lead soprano, Mrs. Fitzgibbons, will come to your home and perform “The Ride of the Valkyries.” [off their looks] We've sold eight hundred tickets, so the risk is pretty minimal. "
"Frasier: All right. "
"Niles: In return, let me offer you a hot stock "
"tip: VectorComp Software. Wendel assures me they can't miss. "
"Martin: Who's Wendel? "
"Niles: My new broker. Every stock he's put me onto has paid off. The man is positively clairvoyant. "
"Daphne: You know, I've got a bit tucked away. Maybe I ought to take a little chance with your Wendel. "
"Niles: I should warn you, it's not a sure thing. "
"Daphne: Oh, nothing in life is a sure thing, but Dr. Snow has a little "
"saying: Nothing ventured, nothing gained. "
"Frasier: She'd better copyright that before some unscrupulous hack steals it. "
"Daphne: I'll go in for five hundred. That's a lot for me, but I don't know; I have a little feeling I'm in for a bit of luck. All right, I better get ready. I'm off to the Book Nook. Dr. Snow is signing copies of her new best seller. "
"Martin: Hey, wait a minute. You're going out? What about my whirlpool therapy? "
"Daphne: Oh, right, I forgot. Maybe you could go to the book signing for me, Dr. Crane. It's right around the corner from the station. "
"Frasier: I would sooner attend a hoe-down. "
"Niles: I would gladly go, but I've got my compulsive spending seminar, and I'm hoping to unload the rest of these raffle tickets. "
"Martin: What's the big deal? "
"Frasier: I have my reputation to think of. "
"Niles: What's the big deal? "
"Frasier: All right, if it will make you all happy to see me humiliate myself. "
"Martin: I always get a kick out of it. "
"Daphne: Thanks ever so. "
"Frasier: Yes, well... Oh, look everyone Eddie has found his inner puppy "
"Frasier: I promise this'll just take a minute. "
"Roz: Well, I hope so, I barely got an hour for lunch. Oh, God, not another one of those Honey Snow books. "
"Frasier: “Don't Change, You're Perfect.” "
"Roz: Can you believe people go for this junk? "
"Frasier: It's unbelievable. Here, get her autograph for me, will you? She's sitting right behind those people over there. Just go get it signed and then we'll get out of here, go have a nice lunch at Le Cigare Volant. "
"Roz: Me? Why don't you do it? "
"Frasier: I have my reputation to think of "
"Roz: Oh, what's the big deal? All right. "
"Woman: Oh, it's wonderful isn't it? I just love what she says about finding a moment each day to stop and give yourself a mental hug. "
"Frasier: I'm giving myself one now. "
"Woman: Really? "
"Frasier: Well actually it's more of a Heimlich maneuver. "
"Roz: Got it. "
"Frasier: Good, good. Let's buy it and get out of here. "
"Roz: Nope, nope, not so fast. She wants to meet you. "
"Frasier: Roz, I don't want to meet the woman, let's just go. "
"Roz: Uh, Frasier, do you know what Honey Snow looks like? "
"Frasier: What difference could that make? The woman stands for everything that I find totally... "
"Frasier: ...enchanting. "
"Honey: Hello. I'm Dr. Honey Snow. "
"Frasier: And I'm... wait, don't tell me, Dr. Frasier Crane. "
"Honey: Well, Dr. Crane, let me shake your hand. Oh, what am I saying? Hug. "
"Frasier: Why not? "
"Honey: After all, a handshake is just a hug for fraidy-cats. "
"Frasier: No fear here. "
"Honey: I am one of your biggest fans "
"Frasier: And I've recently become one of yours. "
"Honey: I think the advice you give is so simple, yet so brilliant. "
"Frasier: Well, what about those mental hugs of yours? It can't get much simpler than that. "
"Roz: You know, I think I'll just go get started on my appetizer. "
"Frasier: Oh, yes, you start without me. All I really want is a little nibble. "
"Roz: Oh, tell me. "
"Honey: You know, I really should get back to my signing, but I'd love to talk more. There seems to be such a positive energy between us. My publisher is giving me a dinner tonight at seven at Bianchi's. Would you come as my guest? "
"Frasier: I'd love to. "
"Honey: Well that's great. "
"Frasier: Well it was nice meeting you, Dr. Snow. "
"Honey: Oh, please, it's Honey. "
"Frasier: It certainly is... "
"TO: "
"Daphne: Good evening, Dr. Crane. "
"Niles: Good evening Daphne, Dad. Ooh, watching the sport of kings, I see. Which horse did you wager on? "
"Martin: Joe's Dream, number eight. "
"Niles: Goodness, he seems to be taking a serene, almost Buddhist approach to the race. "
"Niles: Perhaps you should have invested in something more reliable. Like VectorComp Software. "
"Daphne: Our stock. Did it go up a bit? "
"Niles: No, it went up a lot. Thanks to a takeover bid, it gained forty percent overnight. Wendel advised selling, so, voila, your original five hundred investment plus two hundred profit. "
"Daphne: Two hundred? Oh, Dr. Crane, I could kiss you "
"Martin: Oh, that's a nice little dividend. "
"Niles: I'll say. "
"Daphne: You have to help me decide what to do with it. "
"Niles: Well, you might want to consider letting Wendel reinvest it. That's what I'm doing. It's called 'rolling it over.' "
"Daphne: Then I'll do it. Oh, this is so exciting "
"Frasier: What's all this? "
"Daphne: Well, your brother just gave me two hundred dollars, and now he's going to roll me over. "
"Frasier: Niles? "
"Niles: Communications breakdown. "
"Frasier: Good. "
"Niles: What are you all dressed for. Hot date? "
"Frasier: As a matter of fact, yes. "
"Niles: With whom? "
"Martin: Dr. Honey Snow. "
"Frasier: Did it ever occur to you that I might not want Niles to know who I'm dating? "
"Martin: Sure it did. Right before I said it. "
"Niles: You're dating Dr. Honey Snow? I thought you considered her a complete ninny. What could you possibly see in this- Whoa-hoh, mama "
"Martin: One hell of a cute shrink, huh? Not a man alive wouldn't let her analyze his dreams. "
"Frasier: Analyze them? She could star in them. "
"Niles: Yes, yes, but what on Earth do you say to her when she wants to discuss her work? "
"Frasier: Well, I just simply skirt the issue. "
"Niles: Of course. “Honey, I think your books are just - oh look The waiter's on fire” "
"Frasier: You're just jealous. But not half as jealous as you're about to be. I suggest you get a coaster for your lower lip. "
"Honey: Hi, honey. "
"Frasier: Hi, Honey. Allow me to make the introductions. Daphne Moon, Honey Snow; Honey Snow, Daphne Moon. She's a big fan of yours. "
"Both: Hug "
"Daphne: We've both got sort of unusual names. Daphne Moon, Honey Snow. Come to think of it, if you married my father, your name would be Honey Moon. "
"Frasier: My father, Martin Crane. "
"Honey: Oh, hello. Well it's easy to see where Frasier gets his good looks. "
"Martin: Ah, get outta here. "
"Frasier: And, last but not least, my brother Niles. "
"Honey: Oh, Dr. Niles Crane. I read a wonderful article you wrote in the Journal of Psychiatric Medicine. Let's "
"see: “Gestalt Therapy, Probing the Subconscious.” "
"Niles: Yes. And I believe I read your quiz in "
"Cosmo: “Is Your Guy a Stud or a Dud?” "
"Frasier: Perhaps we should be going. "
"Honey: Well, actually, not yet. I have something I want to give you. "
"Frasier: Oh? "
"Honey: It's a manuscript of my upcoming book. "
"Frasier: Oh. Another one? So soon? "
"Honey: I hope you like it, Frasier. Because if you do, I'd love for you to write the foreword. "
"Frasier: Me? "
"Niles: Who better? "
"Frasier: Well, actually there's so many other people that would be more qualified to write for such an important work. "
"Honey: Well, if I didn't know better, I'd think you didn't want to do it. "
"Frasier: Oh, no, no, no, no. It's a great honor. "
"Daphne: I'll say. The last book had an introduction by Mickey Rooney. "
"Martin: Wow. "
"Frasier: Well there's no two ways about it, then. I'm writing that foreword. "
"Honey: Oh, that's great. "
"Daphne: Just think. By next fall there'll be half a million copies in print with your name right on the cover. "
"Niles: I've got my Christmas shopping done "
"Frasier: Niles, will you please stop giggling? It's very distracting. "
"Niles: I can't help it. Have you read this? "
"Frasier: I'm trying to recommend the book. Reading it doesn't help. Okay, here, how's "
"this: “Many great volumes have been written about human behavior. And I can honestly say, without fear of contradiction, that this book can stand on the shelf next to any of them.” No good, is it? "
"Niles: No, no but this "
"is: “You don't have to be a star to twinkle.” Frasier, I need a hug. "
"Frasier: Oh, Niles, will you please help me? Honey asked me to write this foreword two weeks ago, she's got a deadline, she's been wondering where it is. "
"Niles: “Time is a concept known only to one of God's "
"creatures: man. Just for today, be a sunflower.” [points to a paragraph in the manuscript and giggles] "
"Frasier: Oh, give me that Niles, you just don't understand what's at stake here. I've never felt this way about a woman before. I'm out of control. Her effect on me, it's, it's... there are no words to describe it, really, it's more like a sound... "
"Martin: Talkin' about Honey again? "
"Frasier: Yes. "
"Niles: Frankly, I find it laughable that you're even considering putting your name on five hundred thousand copies of this piffle. Not even piffle. It's piffle light. "
"Martin: Ah, lay off your brother. Some women just have a gift for makin' guys do stupid things. When I was on traffic duty, there was this one cute little redhead, she could talk her way out of any ticket. She could be doin' ninety with a school crossing guard spread-eagled on her hood. She'd flash that pouty little smile of hers and no matter what my partner'd say, I’d just wag my finger and send her on her way. "
"Frasier: Yes, it's the old 'Good Cop, Horny Cop' routine. "
"Daphne: Oh, good, you're all here. I want to show off me new coat. "
"Niles: Very nice, Daphne. "
"Daphne: Yes, I've been spending like a drunken yuppie. Oh, I'm afraid I went a bit over my budget. "
"Niles: Well, if it's cash flow you're concerned about, you should know I got a little call from Wendel today. "
"Martin: What, again? What's that, four times in two weeks? "
"Niles: Yes, the man's a wizard. Daphne, your profit. [gives her a check] "
"Daphne: Four hundred dollars? Oh, Dr. Crane And here's one for Wendel. "
"Niles: Did I mention Wendel has a secretary? "
"Daphne: Oh, you "
"Martin: Well, I'd say this calls for a celebration. "
"Daphne: Tell you what, I'll take you all out for a nice dinner, my treat. I'll just go and put on me new dress and we'll be off. I want you to put on your new shirt with your brown corduroy slacks. "
"Martin: Hey, if you're buyin', I'm gonna wear elastic waist pants and no belt. "
"Frasier: Well, Niles, that broker of yours, he's a marvel "
"Niles: Yes, he's doing wonderful things for me. "
"Frasier: Yes, I'd say so. I've been so impressed with his winning streak lately that I asked Daphne what her latest pick was. I invested a few hundred myself. "
"Niles: Really? Well, congratulations. "
"Frasier: Thank you. But there's just one thing, though, it's very hard to figure out. Although I invested in the very same stock that Daphne did, mine declined and hers went up. How do you explain that? "
"Niles: Obviously, one of us is lying, Frasier. "
"Niles: What are you up to? "
"Frasier: Fess up, Niles, this whole stock thing was a lie from the get-go. "
"Niles: No, no, that's not true. The first stock really did pay off, but then the rest all tanked. And what was I supposed to do? Tell that poor, working-class Venus I'd lost her life savings? I had to pay her back and if I threw in a little extra - well, where's the harm in that? "
"Frasier: Niles, you are giving a woman money in order to obtain physical affection We are talking the world's oldest profession. Granted, this is sort of the Walt Disney version, but still. It's wrong, and I insist you stop it. "
"Niles: No. It's altruistic, it's noble, it's fun, and you can't make me stop. "
"Daphne: Well, Dr. Crane, I want you to take this four hundred dollars back and buy whatever Wendel says. "
"Niles: Consider it done. "
"Frasier: You know, Niles, I've been thinking maybe I should get on that gravy train myself. Tell Wendel I'm in for ten thousand. "
"Daphne: Good lord, ten thousand dollars, Dr. Crane? "
"Frasier: Yes, well just think of the dinner I'll be able to buy when Niles brings me my profits. "
"Martin: Well, what the hell, put me down for a couple of hundred. This guy's some kind of genie "
"Niles: Yes, he's a real treasure, isn't he? I only hope those chest pains he was complaining about this morning turn out to be indigestion. "
"Daphne: So, shall we go then? I've decided on Farmer Jack's Chicken, Chicken, Chicken. I hear the chicken there is very good. "
"Martin: Are you comin'? "
"Niles: Oh, you two run along. I'll take my car. "
"Niles: Well, I hope you're happy "
"Frasier: Snap out of it. What you were doing was completely dishonest. "
"Niles: Ooh, said the pot to the kettle "
"Frasier: What is that supposed to mean? "
"Niles: I think you know what it means. "
"Frasier: Don't be ridiculous Our two situations are totally different. "
"Niles: Oh, really? How so? "
"Frasier: Well, for one thing, you've been misleading a woman for your own selfish gain. "
"Niles: And so are you "
"Frasier: Well, I'm not finished. She was also... trusting you to tell the truth. "
"Niles: Oh, and the difference would be? "
"Frasier: Your woman is English "
"Niles: Frasier, you've lost this one. "
"Frasier: I know. I know. Just going to take a little while to climb down off of this particular high horse. "
"Niles: I think you know what you have to do. "
"Frasier: Yes. I have to tell her I can't write the foreword. Oh, Niles, and I have to say goodbye to the chance of ever sleeping with absolute perfection. Oh, Niles, where oh where will I ever have the chance again to gaze upon such extraordinarily proud supple breasts? "
"Niles: Not to worry, brother. That's the manager's special at Farmer Jack's Chicken, Chicken, Chicken. "
"TO: "
"Honey: That was a wonderful dinner, thank you. "
"Frasier: Yes, well thank you for the fabulous table. I think hugging the maitre d' really clinched it. "
"Honey: Would you care for a nightcap? "
"Frasier: Sure. "
"Honey: You know, you seemed really tense all evening. But I have just the thing. It's a sandalwood candle. The scent is guaranteed to calm you down. "
"Frasier: You better fire up about ten of those. You know, there's something I'd really like to talk to you about. It's about that foreword I've been trying to write for you. "
"Honey: Can we not talk about work tonight, Frasier? I've been chained to my desk all day researching an article I'm doing on sexual intimacy. I am up to here with “The Joy of Sex,” “Kama Sutra,” Masters and Johnson... "
"Frasier: Really? "
"Honey: I feel like I've been reading recipes all day, only there are no groceries in the house. "
"Frasier: Well, your bag-boy has arrived. "
"Frasier: No, no, no, no, I really need to discuss this now. "
"Honey: Oh, you. You are such a workaholic. I only hope you're this tireless about everything. "
"Frasier: Oh, I don't think you'll have any complaints. [He starts to take his tie off.] No, no, no, I've got to focus on the subject at hand. "
"Honey: Frasier, tonight I am the subject at hand. "
"Frasier: No, no, Honey, I can't do it "
"Honey: Oh, that's all right, I have a candle for that too. "
"Frasier: No, no, I, I can't write the foreword. "
"Honey: Well, why not? "
"Frasier: Well, I, I just didn't think it was a very good book. I think the world of you and I wish you the greatest success, but I didn't think the book was good enough to put my name on it. I guess I'll be going now. "
"Honey: I am so attracted to you right now. Most men are so eager to have sex they'll say anything to a woman. How great to meet a man who would risk rejection rather than be dishonest. "
"Frasier: Well, I, uh... have to be true to my inner voice. "
"Honey: You know, frankly I thought the book was weak myself. I rushed it to meet a deadline. I am so glad you respected me enough to be honest. I think honesty is the greatest aphrodisiac of all. "
"Frasier: I hope you feel you can be just as honest to me. "
"Honey: Oh, I do, I do. Tell me everything. I don't want us to hide anything. "
"Frasier: I thought your chapter titles were clumsy and jejune. Your turn. "
"Honey: You use way too much French in everyday conversation. You go. "
"Frasier: I think that sandalwood stinks. "
"Honey: Oh, when you talk about wine, I wish I had a gun. "
"Frasier: I thought your first three books were trite and saccharine. "
"Frasier: It's your turn Honey. Honey? "
"Honey: I am immensely proud of my first three books. "
"Frasier: As well you should be. "
"Honey: You thought they were trite? "
"Frasier: Oh, well, I meant “trite” in its best sense. As in the phrase “trite and true.” "
"Honey: And what about 'saccharine'? "
"Frasier: I love saccharine. Use it every day. "
"Honey: Well, I'm glad you like saccharine, darling, because there's no way you're getting any “honey.” Good night, Frasier. "
"Frasier: Honey, I'm sorry, I really am. Couldn't we try one of your forgiveness exercises? "
"Honey: Good night, Frasier. "
"Frasier: Hug? "
"Honey: You know, a poet once said something about the world that I think applies to our "
"relationship: “It ends, not with a bang, but with a whimper.” "

"Frasier: Well, that's our show for today. Don't forget - Bob 'Bulldog' Briscoe is up next. Oh, yes. This is KACL Cash Call Week. $5,000 if you answer your phone with the phrase that pays. So when your phone rings, don't say hello, say... "
"Frasier: WELL, BLOW ME DOWN Uh...no, no, no. Say, uh... KACL is, uh... the talk of the town... talk of Seattle, whatever, Bye-bye. "
"Frasier: Sam, Sam Oh my God Well, what are you doing in town? "
"Sam: Uh, well actually I'm here interviewing for a job. The Mariners need a pitching coach and they gave me a call. "
"Frasier: They did? "
"Sam: Yeah. "
"Frasier: I mean, that's great, but... well, come on in. "
"Sam: This is all right? You're off the air? "
"Frasier: Oh, yeah, it's fine. "
"Roz: Fras, I gotta go. Your messages are on my desk and... whoa, who is this? "
"Sam: I'm Sam Malone. I was a buddy of Frasier's in Boston. "
"Frasier: This is Roz Doyle. "
"Roz: So this is the Sam Malone you've always talked about? The one who has no respect for women and treats them like dirt? Need anyone to show you around Seattle? "
"Sam: Well, you know, to tell you the truth I'm all right with the city, but I get real lost in my hotel room. "
"Frasier: Oh, boy. Just look at the two of you face to face. I imagine wild animals all over the Northwest are lifting their heads, alerted to the scent. Good-bye, Roz. "
"Roz: Well, if you need any company, give me a call. [hands him a card] Here's my number. "
"Sam: Well, thanks. That's a snazzy card. "
"Frasier: Yes, it glows in the dark. "
"Roz: So do I. "
"Frasier: So, uh, how's everybody at Cheers? "
"Sam: Oh, wow. Uh, well, let's see... you know that Rebecca finally married that plumber? "
"Frasier: Yes, yes... it's ironic, isn't it? You know, she spends all her energy trying to land some rich guy and she ends up with an ordinary plumber. "
"Sam: Well, that ordinary plumber struck gold. He's got a patent on some low-flow toilet thing. I mean, he's rich beyond her wildest dreams. "
"Frasier: Well, heck, I'm happy for her. "
"Sam: Well, don't be - he dumped her. She's back at the bar. "
"Frasier: Working at Cheers again? "
"Sam: No, she's just back at the bar. Hey, you know, here's some good "
"news: Woody and Kelly, they had a baby boy. "
"Frasier: Oh, that is wonderful Is he...? "
"Sam: No, he's smart. He’s smart. "
"Frasier: Oh Well, genetics takes a holiday, huh? So, Sam, you want to continue this over some lunch? "
"Sam: Yeah, I'd like that. "
"Frasier: So, are Norm and Cliff still holding up the bar? "
"Sam: Uh, well, Norm is, but Cliff hasn't been in for a while. Evidently, he read this article about flesh-eating bacteria and he hasn't left his mom's house since. But, you know, there's a good side to that, though, 'cause a lot of people who haven't been around for a while are starting to come back to the bar. "
"Frasier: Oh "
"evening: Daphne is setting the table for dinner. "
"Martin: Hey, Daph, Sam was a major league ballplayer. Put out the good china. "
"Niles: Oh, yes, and while you're at it don't forget the Limoges spittoon. "
"Martin: Well, as far as I'm concerned, Sam Malone's the most important person ever to set foot in this apartment. "
"Daphne: I don't understand this American obsession with sports figures. They're all so superficial. "
"Martin: Yeah, it's not like they do anything real important like sit on a throne or christen ships. [he calls out as he and Daphne enter the kitchen] Hey, Niles, why didn't you bring Maris tonight? "
"Niles: I'm supposed to ask Maris to spend an evening with a baseball player? Why don't I just ask her to rub my shoulders? "
"Frasier: Here we are, Sam. "
"Sam: Oh, wow, look at this. Man, you got quite a babe magnet here. "
"Martin: Oh, Sam Malone Hey, I'm Marty Crane, I'm one of your biggest fans Yeah, I was at the Kingdome the night you gave up four consecutive home runs. I bet you remember that, don't you? "
"Sam: Well, actually I don't. You see, that was during my drinking phase. Did I hit anybody? Did I hurt them? "
"Martin: No. "
"Sam: Oh, hey, then that was a good game "
"Martin: Hey, Sam, this is my chair. You want to sit in it? "
"Sam: Oh... yeah... well, maybe later. "
"Martin: I'll keep it warm for you "
"Frasier: Oh, Sam, this is my brother, Dr. Niles Crane. "
"Niles: Pleasure to meet you. "
"Sam: Yeah, you too. Wow... man, this is freaky. He looks just like you did when I met you. What happened, huh? "
"Frasier: Wasn't exactly a health club you were running there, Sam. "
"Sam: This is strange. I gotta tell you, I didn't know he had a brother. "
"Niles: Frasier, I don't mind telling you I'm a little offended that in all the time you spent swapping bon mots with the beer-nut set, you never once mentioned you had a brother? "
"Sam: Well, you know, the truth is, I bet he said something, it's just that when Frasier gets going you kind of have to tune him out. "
"Niles: That's a good slogan for his radio show - 'Dr. Frasier "
"Crane: when he gets going, you have to tune him out.' "
"Martin: Hey, what did he tell you about me, Sam? His father, the old cop? "
"Sam: Oh, yeah, you I remember. Um, he told me you were dead. "
"Martin: Dead? "
"Frasier: Well, we had had an argument. You called me a stuffed shirt and hung up on me. I was mad. "
"Sam: You're a cop? You told me he was a research scientist. "
"Frasier: You were dead, what did it matter? "
"Daphne: Hello. "
"Frasier: Oh, Daphne... Daphne, this is Sam Malone. Sam, this is Daphne Moon, Dad's physical therapist "
"Daphne: Well, it's a pleasure to meet you. "
"Martin: Daphne's from England. "
"Sam: Yeah, boy, I've always been a sucker for the English accent. No matter what you say, it always sounds so classy and sophisticated. "
"Sam: See what I mean? It kills me every time. [Daphne reaches to get a plate off the table] Hey, let me get that for you. A pretty lady like you shouldn't spend her whole evening in the kitchen. "
"Niles: Is it my imagination, or is Sam flirting with Daphne? "
"Frasier: Of course he's flirting with her. He flirts with everyone. He can't help it, he's a sexual compulsive. But he's getting help for it in a support group. "
"Niles: Did he miss a meeting? "
"Frasier: Hello? You'd like to speak to Sam? Um... [Sam enters from the kitchen] well, who's calling, please? Sheila? "
"Frasier: Um... yes, well, he's not here right now, but I'm expecting him soon. "
"Sam: No Number two "
"Frasier: Uh... I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I was mistaken. He WAS here, but, uh, he left. Well, yes, I'll give him the message. Thank you. I'm sorry, Sam, I'm a little out of practice. So, uh, who's Sheila? "
"Sam: Just the um... woman I'm supposed to marry. "
"Frasier: Marry? When? "
"Sam: Uh, oh boy. Um, yesterday. "
"Frasier: Yesterday? "
"Sam: Yeah... I don't want to talk about it, Frasier. "
"Frasier: But Sam... "
"Sam: Fras, please? Just... "
"Sam: Oh, wow. Hey, something sure smells yummy here. [leans in close to Daphne] Oh, wait a second, I think it's me. "
"evening: Sam and Martin are chatting while Frasier and "
"Martin: Come on, Sam, one more. "
"Sam: All right, let's see. Uh... 1949, Yankees, initials V.R. "
"Martin: Vic Raschi. "
"Sam: Oh, you're great. He's amazing. All you have to do is give him the city, the date and the initials and he gets it every time. "
"Niles: That's very similar to a game Frasier and I play. [to Frasier] I'll go first. 1962, Prague Philharmonic, viola section, initials C.M. "
"Frasier: Czeslaw Milovicz. "
"Niles: Wrong, wrong, wrong No, no, no--I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Milovicz was first viola the year before, but by '62 he'd developed Rosin poisoning and was no longer able to pluck. "
"Frasier: Damn That's a trick question "
"Martin: Well, I'm off to bed. Thanks, Sam. The chair's all yours Come on "
"Sam: Oh, yeah... that's very nice. "
"Martin: ’Night, all. "
"Daphne: I'll be turning in, too. "
"Niles: Pleasant dreams. "
"Daphne: "
"Niles: Well, I guess I'd better be getting back to my Maris. If the clock strikes twelve and she hasn't felt my kiss upon her forehead she gets nervous. Sam, it's been a pleasure meeting you. "
"Sam: Yeah, you too. Hey listen... if you want to really put a smile on Maris's face let me tell you what you do. "
"Niles: Exactly where am I supposed to find whipped cream and a car battery at this hour? "
"Sam: You got neighbors, dontcha? "
"Frasier: Well, Sam, now that everybody's gone, there was something I wanted to bring up. I just - what is it, what is it... Oh yes, yes, I "
"remember: what the hell do you mean you were about to get married? "
"Sam: All right, all right. Uh, well, I met this girl six months ago and we were supposed to get married. And yesterday I was standing in this church facing this minister and I hear him say, 'Will you take this woman to be your wife?' and I said, 'Who, me?' The next thing you know I'm running down the aisle and I didn't stop running till I got here. "
"Frasier: So, you're not in Seattle because of the Mariners? "
"Sam: Believe me, no ballplayer is in Seattle because of the Mariners. "
"Frasier: All right, all right. Sam, let's have a seat here and start this thing from the very beginning. [they sit at the dinner table] Now, who is this woman? "
"Sam: Oh, she's a terrific person. She's smart, she's funny, she's horny. I mean, she's just the kind of chick you want to stick up on a pedestal. "
"Frasier: You know, Sam, it's always amazed me how you can elevate and demean in the same sentence. "
"Sam: What? "
"Frasier: Forget it, just... "
"Sam: Well, how do you think she found me here? "
"Frasier: Well, it's my guess, Sam, that you left a lot of clues as to where you were because, basically you wanted her to find you. I have a feeling that you actually want to marry this girl. "
"Sam: Yeah? I don't know... "
"Frasier: Look, Sam, all that happened was you panicked. It's perfectly natural. The wedding ceremony represents the end of your old life. "
"Sam: I tell you, man, she's one in a million, you know? "
"Frasier: You know, for most guys that's just an expression. "
"Frasier: You know, Sam, I have a feeling that you're finally ready for a commitment like this. I think you ought to get on that phone and call her. "
"Sam: What would I say to her, though? "
"Frasier: Well, just tell her you panicked and ran. Tell her the truth. I mean, after all, honesty is the cornerstone of a healthy relationship. "
"Sam: Hey, thank you. You know, it's time I stepped up to the plate and stopped acting like a kid. [picks up the phone] "
"Frasier: Absolutely. Geez, the only question now is, will she still take you back? "
"Roz: She actually forgave him? "
"Frasier: Yes, yes... More than that, she's on her way here in a plane right now. They're going to get married in Hawaii. "
"Roz: Same old story. Love triumphs over Roz. "
"Frasier: Oh Roz, don't be a sore loser, will you, please? Look, I invited them here on their way in from the airport. "
"Niles: I remember my wedding day. Standing at the altar, feeling faint, shaky, sweating. I remember Maris was so distraught thinking I might have cold feet. I'll never forget how relieved she was to learn that it was just a congenital heart murmur that would plague me for the rest of my life. "
"Sam: Hey, everybody. "
"Frasier: Oh, Sam "
"Sam: Here she is - the future Mrs. Sam Malone. Sheila, this is Frasier. "
"Sheila: Hello, Frasier, it's nice to finally meet you. "
"Frasier: Sheila, likewise. Uh, this is Roz and Niles. "
"Niles: Congratulations. "
"Sheila: Thank you. "
"Sam: You want to sit down? I'll get us some coffee or something. "
"Sheila: No, actually Sam, it was sort of a long flight. I was hoping maybe to go back to the hotel and freshen up. "
"Sam: Well, all right, whatever. Hey, will you join us for dinner about 8"
":00? "
"Frasier: Sure. Right... right. "
"Sam: Great. All right. Uh, well I guess we're off to freshen up a little. "
"Frasier: Oh, my god. "
"Roz: Well, she was cute but she's not an, 'Oh, my god.' "
"Frasier: No, no, no. Not that 'Oh, my god.' Oh, my god, I slept with that woman three months ago. "
"Roz: You slept with her? "
"Frasier: Yes "
"Niles: On what desert island with no hope of rescue was this? "
"Frasier: I was... I was in Boston for a long weekend. I was feeling a little depressed, so I took solace in the arms of a... a beautiful and remarkably welcoming young woman in a hotel bar. "
"Niles: And that was she? "
"Frasier: No, Niles. I told you that for absolutely no reason whatsoever. Of course it was she Did you see the way she ran out of here the minute she saw me? "
"Niles: Ah, yes. The trademark of all your bedmates. Wait a minute. Three months ago? Didn't Sam say they'd been together for six months? "
"Roz: Well, it looks like this horse race is on again. "
"Frasier: Oh, put the weapon down Stop it, Roz Have you no scruples whatsoever? "
"Roz: You're the one who slept with your friend's fiancée "
"Frasier: Well, I didn't know that at the time "
"Niles: Surely you have to tell Sam about this. "
"Frasier: Oh, what, and ruin our relationship as well as theirs? What I've got to do is, actually I've got to speak to her first. Hear her side of this story. I mean, after all, there are hundreds of reasons why people have affairs. "
"Niles: Roz, you want to get us started? [she shoots him a dirty look] "
"Frasier: Niles. Well, there's got to be some explanation. Maybe they stopped seeing each other for a couple of weeks. Maybe Sam cheated on her and she was just doing it to get even with him. Or, who knows? Maybe she just found me completely irresistible. "
"Roz: Oh yeah, that's it. "
"Frasier: Oh, all right "
"Roz: You struck gold there, Frasier "
"TO: "
"evening: Frasier knocks on the door and Sheila answers. "
"Sheila: Hello, Frasier. "
"Frasier: Hello, Sheila. Good to see you again. Sam, you are one lucky guy "
"Sheila: He's out getting our plane tickets. "
"Frasier: Oh, good. Look, you have some explaining to do, young lady "
"Sheila: Okay, okay. Wine? "
"Frasier: No, thank you. "
"Sheila: Look... first of all, I know this doesn't excuse what I did, but I had no idea that you were a friend of Sam's. I'm a sexual compulsive. It's how Sam and I met - in group. Look, that night I spent with you - I guess I just kind of fell off the wagon. What I did was terrible. I felt awful afterwards. It ended up being a kind of turning point for me. That's how it is with addiction; before you can get better you have to hit rock bottom. "
"Frasier: Yes. Well... I'm glad I could be down there for you. "
"Sheila: Listen, Frasier - I'm human, I made a mistake. Can you understand that? "
"Frasier: Oh, of course I can understand, Sheila. And I sympathize. I've had many patients that share your affliction... although, to date you're the only one I've met who can hit the emergency button of an elevator with a stiletto heel. "
"Sheila: I want you to know that I love Sam and I'm going to do everything I can to make this marriage work. "
"Frasier: Well, you certainly do seem sincere about this. I think, in all good conscience I can support this marriage, but I want you to know if you start to feel yourself slipping, here's my number. No, no, no... so I can help you as a psychiatrist "
"Sheila: Oh Thank you. "
"Frasier: Oh, and... I think it's probably best if maybe we don't tell Sam about the two of us. "
"Sheila: Agreed. "
"Frasier: It's not that I have a guilty conscience or anything. "
"Sam: I'm back. "
"Frasier: Yaahh "
"Sam: You all right? "
"Frasier: Got a little charley horse, Sam. "
"Sheila: Did you get the tickets, Sam? "
"Sam: Yeah, I did. They're right here. "
"Sheila: I'm so happy. By this time tomorrow we'll be Mr. and Mrs. Sam Malone. "
"Sam: Yeah... um, I want to talk to you about that. Um, Frasier said something the other day that really stuck in my mind. "
"Frasier: Well, that's a first. What did I say? "
"Sam: You know, that thing about honesty being something... of something... it was pro-honesty. "
"Frasier: Being the cornerstone of a good relationship? "
"Sam: Yeah, right. Well, that really stuck in my mind. Uh...to tell you the truth, I haven't really been honest with you, Sheila. "
"Sheila: What do you mean? "
"Sam: When we get married I want us to have a clean slate sweetheart, you know? Boy, I hope you can forgive me for this, but a few months ago, I had a slip. Actually, I had two slips but they happened simultaneously so I'm counting it as one. "
"Frasier: Was this after you were engaged? "
"Sam: Uh, actually, it was that night. I'm... I'm so sorry. Listen, it has not happened since and I swear to God it will not happen again. "
"Sheila: Sam, I forgive you. "
"Sam: You do? "
"Sheila: Actually, I'm relieved, because I have something that I need to confess to you. You're not the only one who... slipped. "
"Frasier: You know... I think it's time you guys had a little privacy. "
"Sam: No, no. Frasier, you're responsible for getting us this far. Now, we have no secrets. All right. Who? "
"Sheila: Well, that's what makes it so tough. It was someone from Cheers. "
"Frasier: Uh... you know, I just remembered. I parked in a loading zone. I'd better... "
"Sheila: Sam, I slept with Paul. "
"Frasier: Paul? Short... "
"Sam: Bald... "
"Frasier: Fat... "
"Sam: Paul? "
"Sheila: I didn't say he was good. "
"Sam: Well, you know - all right, I understand that. You were giving Paul a break or something, you know? And I can forgive that. This is what this is all about, isn't it - forgiveness? "
"Frasier: Yes, yes. Okay, you told one, you told one, that's great, we're all even-steven Let's go eat. "
"Sheila: There was someone else... "
"Frasier: What, are we still on this? Geez – I mean, there is honesty and there's beating a dead horse "
"Sam: It doesn't matter. I don't care. It doesn't matter who it is. "
"Sheila: Yes, it does matter, Sam. I mean, this one is really embarrassing. I was lonely, I was desperate and I'd just been to the eye doctor and my pupils were dilated... "
"Frasier: Oh, Sheila, for God's sake Look, I'll tell him. "
"Frasier: Sam, what's she's trying to say is... "
"Sheila: It was Cliff. "
"Sam: What? "
"Frasier: I believe she said 'Cliff.' "
"Sam: Cliff? Cliff... you? You slept with Cliff? CLIFF? Oh no, that's it, wedding's off Cliff - oh, God "
"Sheila: Whoa... Frasier, you've got to help me. You've got to talk to him. "
"Frasier: I slept with a woman who slept with Cliff? "
"TO: "
"evening: Frasier is driving Sam to the airport. "
"Sam: Oh, boy. It's gonna be a long flight home. "
"Frasier: Well, I know it was painful, Sam, but you made the right decision. "
"Sam: Yeah, I suppose. Geez... Cliff "
"Frasier: You're just using Cliff as the excuse. We both know there were more compelling reasons for you to back out of this thing. "
"Sam: Hmm... No, it was Cliff. "
"Frasier: You know, Sam, to put this thing aside once and for all, I... "
"Sam: Do you realize you're probably the only friend I have who she didn't sleep with? "
"Frasier: Cliff. That is a tough one to swallow, huh? But, you know the important thing is that you proved to yourself that you're ready for a commitment even if Sheila wasn't the one. "
"Sam: Yeah... I suppose so. "
"Frasier: You know, in a way we're both in the same boat. "
"Sam: Yeah? What do you mean? "
"Frasier: Well, you know... we've tried, we've failed. But we'll try again. Sam, we're looking for a meaningful relationship. "
"Sam: Yeah, that's it. That's the word right there - 'meaningful.' "
"Frasier: We're gonna find it though, buddy. I tell you. "
"Sam: You bet we will. You know, stewardesses usually hang out at that airport bar. "
"Frasier: That says meaningful to me. "

" "
"Frasier: Dad? "
"Frasier: Daphne? Anybody home? "
"suddenly: "
"Frasier: You shake my nerves and you rattle my brain Too much love drives a man insane Oh, what a thrill, just what a thrill Goodness gracious, great balls of fire "
"Martin: I still think you're making too big a deal out of this "
"Niles: Dad, I have never seen Maris this angry. I swear, her eye was twitching like a frog in a science experiment. "
"Martin: Well, when your mother'd get mad at me, I'd just grab her, bend her backwards, and give her a kiss which made her glad she was a woman "
"Niles: I can't do that with Maris. She has abnormally rigid vertebrae, she'd snap like a twig. "
"Frasier: Let me guess, Maris has moved into the east wing again? "
"Niles: Sunday was her fortieth birthday. She said in no uncertain terms she wanted no acknowledgement of it whatsoever, and in a moment I live over and over in my dreams, I believed her. "
"Frasier: What, no gifts? No party? No nothing? "
"Niles: Say that weeping into an ermine lap robe and you've got her down perfectly. "
"Martin: Oh, why don't you just get her a nice bottle of perfume? "
"Niles: She gets hives. "
"Martin: How about candy? "
"Niles: Hypoglycemic. "
"Martin: Just get her a dozen roses. "
"Niles: Allergic. "
"Frasier: Well listen Niles, why don't you just sit her down and have a little talk, tell her it was a mistake. We’ve all noticed she's a bit touchy about her age, even though it's not the first time she's turned forty. "
"Niles: I know I'll throw a great big party for her this weekend. It'll be a costume ball – with a Louis Quatorze theme, right down to the powdered wigs and the crushed velvet pantaloons May I presume you're both coming down with colds? "
"Niles: And so it goes. "
"Frasier: Listen dad, you didn't happen to find a book lying around here? The station manager loaned it to me and I promised I'd return it today. "
"Martin: What's it called? "
"Frasier: The Life And Times Of Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree. It's a stunningly witty history of the English theatre. "
"Martin: Oh OK, you caught me, I got it hidden under my pillow "
"Frasier: Dad, you could at least try to be a little bit helpful, I promised him I'd return it today. "
"Martin: Well, ask Daphne when she comes in. She was looking for something too put her to sleep last night, that book sounds like it could put her into a coma. "
"TO: Daphne's Room "
"closely: it is Daphne with Prince "
"Daphne: Dr. Crane "
"Frasier: Daphne. "
"Daphne: What are you doing in my room? "
"Frasier: Look, I thought you were out... not that I make a habit of coming in here when you're out Well, I thought I came in to get my book which I have, see. Well, I'll just be going - me and my book. See Frasier go. "
"Niles: Nadia, you tell Mrs. Crane I want to speak to her and don't take no for an answer "
"Niles: Well then Nadia, you tell her that Dr. Crane says... Please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please... "
"Martin: Maris hung up on you, huh? "
"Niles: No, now she's got Nadia doing her dirty work. Nadia is Maris's hatchet maid. "
"Martin: What happened to that Louis the French guy birthday party? "
"Niles: Disaster there too Maris reminded me that an entire branch of her family tree were slaughtered by the Huguenots. "
"Frasier: Well, let's just forget about Maris for the time being, shall we? Sit down and have a nice meal in a convivial atmosphere. "
"Niles: What is she mad about? "
"Martin: Beats me "
"Daphne: Here's your favorite, Mr. Crane, cream onions. And, Dr. Crane, I've made my special glazed carrots just for you. "
"Niles: Thank you. "
"Daphne: "
"Martin: Well, we don't know what she's mad at, but we sure as hell know who "
"Daphne: If anyone needs me, I'll be eating in my room. You know where that is "
"Martin: What did you do? "
"Frasier: This morning, I went into her bedroom. "
"Niles: Frasier, how could you? No matter how irresistible the urge to venture down that hallway... to press your face against that door... to actually feel the grain of the wood against your cheek... It must be fought It must be fought- "
"Frasier: Oh, Niles I simply went in there to retrieve my book. "
"Martin: You're not supposed to go in there "
"Frasier: Oh, what's the big deal? "
"Martin: Do you ever see her leave her door open? She doesn't like people going in there. "
"Frasier: She goes into my room all the time, and it doesn't bother me "
"Martin: Women are different. "
"Frasier: Dad, that is sexism talking. "
"Martin: No, that's thirty-five years of marriage talking. Women protect their privacy. You know how they are about their handbags. You never go in there It's always 'bring me my purse.' The husband could say, 'honey, I'm being robbed, the guy's holding a gun to my head and I don't have any money,' the wife'd say, 'bring me my purse.' "
"Niles: Dad, as usual, your simple homespun wisdom has pricked the balloon of Frasier's pomposity. "
"Martin: Now you were wrong, so go on in there and apologize. Go on "
"Frasier: Alright I'll go into Daphne's room and I will apologize to her. "
"Frasier: Alone, Niles "
"TO: Daphne’s Room. "
"Daphne: Yes. "
"Frasier: Daphne, it's Dr. Crane. "
"Daphne: Yes "
"Frasier: Could you open the door, please? "
"TO: Hallway. "
"Frasier: I, I behaved very insensitively this morning. And I did need the book but it was wrong of me to go in without your permission. "
"Frasier: And I'm sorry. "
"Frasier: It'll never happen again. "
"Frasier: Ever. "
"Frasier: I'm being very nice. "
"Frasier: Well, good night Daphne. "
"Daphne: Oh, wait, I'm being much too hard on you I'm just a little sensitive about my privacy. "
"Frasier: Oh, there's no need to explain. I promise you, it will never be an issue again "
"Daphne: Well, thank you for being so understanding. I suppose my problem goes back to growing up in a household of boys. My brothers were all snoops. They never gave me a moment’s peace. Oh, it was a filthy little rite of passage for the Moon "
"boys: when I reached a certain age, they'd sneak into the bathroom and peek at me in the shower. "
"Frasier: Oh, dear God All eight of them? "
"Daphne: Well, except for my brother Billy, the ballroom dancer. He never peeked at me. Though he did peek at my brother Nigel. "
"Frasier: Coffee, dad? "
"Martin: Why not? I'm up six times a night anyway, I might as well be alert "
"Martin: Oh geez, the disposal’s jammed Yeah, stick your hand down there, see what's stuck, will ya? "
"Niles: Dad, it's me, Niles. "
"Martin: I can't get my hand in there. "
"Niles: Oh alright, punish a man for being fine-boned. Are you sure it's off? "
"Martin: Positive. "
"Niles: Ah-ah-ah Move away from the switch "
"Martin: Oh, geez... "
"Niles: Oh-ho, it's wet and slimy and God knows what, it's like sticking my hand into the mouth of hell... "
"Niles: YAAAH "
"Martin: Give me a call when the coffee's ready. "
"Frasier: Yes. "
"Frasier: Sorry, Niles. Thank God. "
"Niles: That's enough excitement for one evening, I'm going home to Maris. "
"Frasier: I thought she wasn't speaking to you. "
"Niles: She's not, but she grows weary of being frosty to the help. "
"TO: Living Room "
"Niles: Oh, by the way I'm out of cash, I need something to tip your garage attendant. "
"Frasier: Oh, great "
"Niles: What? "
"Frasier: These pills "
"Niles: I was thinking money but you know him better than I do. "
"Frasier: No, Daphne's prescription. When I was in her room earlier, I must have inadvertently... knocked them into my pocket. "
"Niles: That's an interesting phenomenon. I can't walk through a drug store without aspirin and decongestant leaping into my trousers "
"Frasier: OK, I was snooping around a little bit. Oh, dear God 'Take one before bedtime.' Oh no, she's sure to miss these tonight. "
"Daphne: Oh, you heading off, Dr. Crane? "
"Niles: Yes, I am. "
"Daphne: Say hello to your wife. "
"Niles: I'll certainly try. "
"Daphne: Mr. Crane, time for your exercises [leaves to Martin's room] "
"Frasier: Oh great, this is my chance. I'll just sneak back there and put these back in her room. "
"Frasier: Alone, Niles "
"Martin: The Sonics game's on I'll do my exercises tomorrow. "
"Daphne: Fine If you need me I'll be in my room. "
"Daphne: You're doing a double set tomorrow "
"Martin: Yeah, yeah... "
"Daphne: Grumpy old sod... "
"Daphne: What are you doing? It's disgusting, you filthy thing. "
"Daphne: Get out of here right now, get out "
"Frasier: Daphne, I'm so sorry "
"TO: "
"Niles: Good morning, Frasier "
"Niles: Cara mia, uno mezzo latte decaffinato, and a bran muffin. No, no... Maris and I burned up a lot of energy last night - a LOT of energy – and I have to replenish my body. "
"Frasier: I assume you and Maris achieved détente. "
"Niles: Twice "
"Frasier: What magic words did you use to melt your little glacier? "
"Niles: I got home, I sat her down, I stared deeply into her eyes... and I said, 'Maris, here are the keys to your new Mercedes.' "
"Frasier: You bought her a Mercedes? "
"Niles: Yes – oh, the things that tiny woman can do when she's properly motivated. "
"Frasier: If you're through marinating in your own testosterone, I have a problem. Remember last night I went back into Daphne's room? Well, she caught me again. "
"Niles: You're joking "
"Frasier: I was just so embarrassed I had to leave this morning before she woke up. I left a little note, trying to explain my actions. Considering the circumstances, I don't think there's any way she can forgive me "
"Niles: Oh, come now. It wasn't as bad as all that. It's not like you saw her naked or something. "
"Niles: You did "
"Frasier: But I took no pleasure in it at all The entire thing was just absolutely mortifying "
"Niles: Frasier, I want to help you with this, so you have to tell me everything. Every sight, every sound – Frasier, unburden yourself before you explode [he says about to explode himself] "
"Frasier: No, Niles, no "
"Niles: Alright then, I'll show you how I've always imagined her and you tell me where I'm wrong "
"Roz: Hey, guys "
"Frasier: Hi, Roz. "
"Niles: Hello. "
"Frasier: Good to see you. "
"Roz: So Niles, you randy dog, you got lucky last night, didn't you? Oh, don't worry, you'll meet somebody. Can I have a non- fat cap, please? "
"Niles: Roz, this was a private conversation, I'm helping my brother with a matter of some delicacy. "
"Roz: Don't worry, Shower Boy told me all about it. "
"Frasier: I just don't see that there's any way I can make it up to Daphne. "
"Niles: Well, nothing says I'm sorry like a in-dash CD player and a passenger side airbag "
"Frasier: Maris was upset with Niles so he bought her a Mercedes. "
"Roz: Woof "
"Frasier: And if you're suggesting that I buy my way out of my problem, the answer is no It's the coward’s way out "
"Niles: Oh, so I'm a coward? "
"Frasier: Yes "
"Niles: Well, I'm a coward with a hickey "
"Roz: Buy me a Mercedes and I'll make your neck look like a relief map of the Andes. "
"Frasier: Oh Roz, don't encourage him, I happen to think that bribery is the wrong way for couples to resolve their conflicts "
"Niles: Oh really, and during which of your failed marriages did you hone that theory? "
"Martin: Oh, Dr. Crane, I'm glad to see you. I need some advice. I've got this son who's a total numbnut. "
"Frasier: Hello, dad. Love your icebreaker "
"Martin: You’d better get her to stay, Frasier. She knows my moods, she's knows how to handle me, and I like her. "
"Frasier: She's talking about quitting? "
"Martin: Yes, so get in there and apologize "
"Frasier: Oh dad, I can't go in there "
"Martin: No, of course you can't, because I asked you to go in there. When I said, 'don't go in there' what did you do? You went in there. Now I say go in there and you won't That's what I like about Eddie, he always does what I tell him to. Come on, Eddie. "
"Frasier: He's defying you too, dad "
"Frasier: Daphne, Daphne, please, please wait, we've gotta talk. I feel absolutely terrible. "
"Daphne: Oh, now, Dr. Crane, your note explained everything, you've got nothing to feel bad about. "
"Frasier: That puts my mind at ease. "
"Daphne: A servant like me doesn't deserve privacy anyway Matter of fact, why don't we just get it all out in the open? "
"Daphne: Here's my bank book, some personal letters, oh and my driver's license. As you can see, I'm four pounds heavier now, but it's in a spot that doesn't really show... TO MOST PEOPLE "
"Frasier: Oh look, Daphne, I realize how hard it is to live in someone else's home. "
"Daphne: Yes, it is But I put up with it, because I happen to love this job. All I ever asked for was one room, a little corner I could call my own. I never minded if I was up to my eyeballs in your precious earth tones and your African knick-knacks, but now I have to put up with you in there, too. And that's one leering love god too many "
"Frasier: Oh Daphne, you're absolutely right, you do deserve a place of your own. Listen if you agree to stay, I'll I'll have your room redecorated. Just make it your own. Paint, wallpaper, upholstery, anything you'd like. Just so you feel comfortable. "
"Daphne: How about an electrified fence and a German police dog? "
"Frasier: Daphne, I promise, as long as we live under the same roof together, I will never ever set foot in your room again. "
"Daphne: Alright. "
"Frasier: Thank you. "
"Daphne: I'll give it another try. "
"Niles: Hello, all. "
"Frasier: Ah, Niles "
"Daphne: Hello, Dr. Crane. Goodbye, Dr. Crane. "
"Niles: Oh, where are you off to? "
"Daphne: I have some shopping to do. Your brother just offered to pay to have my room re-decorated. "
"Niles: Oh, really? "
"Daphne: I'm thinking of doing the whole thing in pinks and yellows. "
"Frasier: Dear God, she's really determined to keep me out of there. "
"Niles: So, you're putting things right with Daphne by opening up your checkbook? "
"Frasier: Oh, I know what you’re thinking, and believe me, it's just a gesture. "
"Niles: Oh, I see. I give Maris a car, it's a bribe. When you re-decorate Daphne's room, it's a gesture. "
"Frasier: Niles, our two situations are entirely different. You bought Maris off because you are afraid of her. "
"Niles: Oh I see, and you're not the slightest bit intimidated by Daphne? "
"Frasier: No. "
"Niles: Then you wouldn't be at all alarmed if I were to, say, do this. "
"Frasier: But... Niles Niles, where are you going? "
"TO: Hallway "
"Niles: Oh look, my foot's in Daphne's room. "
"Frasier: Just get out of there. "
"Niles: What's the matter? Are you afraid you'll get... in trouble? "
"Frasier: Niles... "
"Niles: Now we’re safe. "
"Frasier: Oh, stop it "
"Niles: Safe. "
"Frasier: Niles, you’re acting like a child "
"Niles: Trouble, safe, trouble, safe, trouble, safe "
"Frasier: Oh my God, no You see what you've done now She's bound to find out "
"Niles: Well, so you'll just write her a bigger, fatter check. "
"Frasier: No, Niles, she'll quit "
"Niles: WHAT? Why didn’t you say something- "
"Martin: What the hell are you two doing in here? "
"Frasier: It’s all Niles’s fault "
"Niles: It is not "
"Frasier: Never mind, just help us clean up this mess "
"camera: "
"TO: "
"Daphne: Oooooh "
"Frasier: Daphne, did you happen to see that sporty little sub-compact over there? I bet you could park that anywhere. "
"Daphne: Is that a Mercedes dealership across the street? "
"Time: 21"
":30) "
"Credits: "
" "
"Frasier: Well, we’ve got time for one more call. Roz, who've we got? "
"Roz: We have Sid in Bremerton on three. "
"Frasier: Hello, Sid. I'm listening. "
"Sid: Hello, Dr. Crane. I have a terrible fear of talking on the phone to people I do not know. I freeze up. It is a severe handicap in today's fast-paced, highly competitive world. "
"Frasier: Sid, are you reading what you're saying? "
"Sid: Uh... Yes, I am. The only way I can comfortably communicate on the phone is to write everything out I wish to say in advance. "
"Frasier: Well, what if someone asks you a question you haven't anticipated? "
"Sid: Uhhhh... Thank you, Dr. Crane, for your most insightful comment. G-Goodbye. "
"Frasier: Wait, Sid Sid, if you're listening, your insecurity is rooted in your fear of making a mistake. In order to beat this thing, you're going to have to practice. If you work at it very hard. Then, one day, you too may achieve the command and confidence to which we all aspire to... be having. This is Dr. Frasier Crane, wishing you good mental health. "
"Roz: That was a show good, Frasier. "
"Frasier: Thank you, Roz. "
"Niles: Knock, knock "
"Frasier: Oh, Niles What are you doing here? "
"Niles: Oh, just stopped by to see how you'd like to go to lunch next week at the Empire Club. "
"Frasier: You know someone who's a member? "
"Niles: No, but you may. "
"Frasier: What are you up to? You have that same smug look you had on your face when you found that recording of Kirsten Flagstad's 1932 Gotterdammerung in the discount bin. "
"Niles: If you think I look smug now, wait till you see me next week. If all goes well, my lapel will be sagging under the weight of a solid gold membership pin. "
"Roz: Well, you'll certainly fit right in with all those greedy, arrogant bluebloods who wouldn't cross the street to spit on the rest of us. "
"Niles: Don't jinx it, Roz, I'm not in yet. There's still the cocktail party next week where they screen prospective members, and from what I hear, those can be grueling. "
"Frasier: So, how did this all come about? "
"Niles: Oh, really I give the credit to Maris. She spent five years carefully cultivating the right relationships until finally this week, fortune smiled upon "
"us: Old Judge Clement suffered a massive stroke, and, lo a vacancy opened up. "
"Frasier: Gives new meaning to the phrase, 'a stroke of luck.' "
"Niles: It gets better There are actually two vacancies, so my chances are double. Edgar Van Cortland has been indicted in that savings and loans scandal. Frasier, I think my time has come. "
"Frasier: Well, I'm very happy for you. "
"Niles: That's very generous of you, especially knowing you've always dreamed of a membership yourself. A lesser man would be jealous. You're not, are you? "
"Frasier: Not at all. "
"Niles: Did I mention that they have a planetarium on the third floor? "
"Frasier: So? "
"Niles: I think my work here is done. "
"Roz: So, Niles is getting into the Empire Club? "
"Frasier: Well, it would appear so. More power to him. After all, he deserves to have lunch in that private dining room, and read the Wall Street Journal in that fabled mahogany library... "
"Roz: It's eating you up inside, isn't it? "
"Frasier: Like a carnivorous bacteria. If he gets into that club I should too "
"Roz: Well, what if I happen to know someone very high up who could probably get you invited to that cocktail party? "
"Frasier: Oh Roz, don't toy with me "
"Roz: Mr. Strickland, please. Just tell him it's Roz. "
"Frasier: Walter Strickland, Jr? "
"Roz: Senior. "
"Frasier: Roz, how did you ever get to know someone so important? "
"Roz: The less you know the happier you'll be. "
"Martin: Whew I think I need more comfortable shoes. My dogs are killing me. "
"Daphne: Pardon? "
"Martin: My dogs. My feet. What do you call them in England? "
"Daphne: Well, we mostly call our body parts by their rightful names. Except my uncle Harold. He named parts of his anatomy after the royal family. He walked on the Queen's pins, he sat on the Duchess of Kent. He was quite a jolly fellow. That is, until Aunt Kate caught him introducing the Prince of Wales to a cocktail waitress. "
"Frasier: Daphne, are you almost finished with that? "
"Daphne: Yes I am, Dr. Crane. You'll have the handsomest midriff at the Club tonight. "
"Frasier: Thank you. I hope my date concurs. "
"Martin: Who are you taking to this shindig? "
"Frasier: Dr. Susan Anderson. She's as boring as unbuttered toast, but she's a brilliant physician, and been socially well- connected. "
"Martin: Isn't Niles a little ticked off at you horning in on his big party? "
"Frasier: Well, yes, he was, at first. But, then I convinced him that we could be of help to each other. If we work together, we can secure both vacancies. "
"Martin: Boy, you and Niles – it’s been the same since you were kids. If one of you has something, the other one always has to have it too. I had to buy two Balinese lutes, two découpage kits, two pairs of lederhosen. When you finally moved out of the house that was one embarrassing garage sale. "
"Frasier: Hello, Niles. "
"Niles: Ready to go? "
"Frasier: No, actually, I'm still waiting on Susan; she's at the hospital. "
"Martin: Where's Maris? "
"Niles: Uh, she stayed in the Mercedes, practicing her vivacious giggle. Let's go over our strategy. I've prepared a crib sheet on each person on the membership committee. There you are... "
"Frasier: Hmm... School ties... business affiliations... hobbies... mistresses. "
"Niles: Oh, oh, oh Now I've also done some research on our competition, and frankly, I don't think we have to worry. One of them flies coach. "
"Frasier: We're as good as in "
"Niles: Yes, yes... "
"Frasier: Unless... oh, Niles I just had the most terrifying thought. "
"Niles: Hmm? "
"Frasier: What if some other candidate has gone to the trouble of researching... the skeletons in our own closet? "
"Niles: Well, that's as bad as it gets. "
"Frasier: I wouldn't be so sure. I don't think the membership committee would look kindly on your being arrested for mooning President Nixon at the campaign rally. "
"Niles: I was young and firm and in love with an anarchist. Besides, that's pretty minor compared to your suicide attempt. "
"Frasier: It was not a legitimate attempt. I only stepped out on that ledge to get Lilith's attention. "
"Niles: Oh, you know Frasier, perhaps Maris and I should head on over without you. We can't have the other candidates getting a leg up on us. "
"Frasier: Oh, that's a good idea, Niles. I'll see you there. "
"Niles: Alright. Bye, Dad. "
"Martin: Good luck. "
"Niles: Thanks. "
"Frasier: Hello? Oh, Susan, Susan Oh my goodness, I've been expecting you. Are you in the car? Oh no, you're still at the hospital? Well, of course I understand. Well, you were a sweetheart to agree to go in the first place. I'll call you tomorrow. Fat chance. "
"Martin: Stood you up, huh? "
"Frasier: This is disastrous "
"Martin: Well, just go stag. "
"Frasier: No, I've RSVP'd for two. I'll look like some loser who couldn't even scrape up a date. "
"Martin: Wait a minute. What are we worried about? We've got our very own Cinderella right under this roof. "
"Daphne: Well, that's the last time I try to get grout up without wearing rubber gloves. I've got so much gunk under my nails I look like I've been worming a pig. "
"Martin: Trust me, the English accent'll sell it. "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Oh... oh, yes... oh, it's everything I've ever imagined it would be and more "
"Daphne: What's that smell, Dr. Crane? "
"Frasier: That's power. Oh, Daphne, listen, call me Frasier. I don't want people to know that you work for me, all right? If they ask, we've been dating for six months. "
"Daphne: Alright, Frasier. Anything else, Frasier? Now, are we in love, or is this just a physical thing, Frasier? "
"Frasier: Oh, now just stop that "
"Frasier: Oh, Niles, Niles How goes the chase? "
"Niles: Brilliantly Daphne "
"Daphne: Evening, Dr. Crane. "
"Niles: What are you doing here? "
"Daphne: Oh, Frasier takes me everywhere, don't you, sweetheart? I think I'll go sample some of the hors d'oeuvres. Back in a minute, darling. "
"Niles: “Sweetheart?' 'Darling?” "
"Frasier: Listen, my date canceled, Daphne's filling in, all right? You can't honestly think that I would end up going out with Daphne? "
"Niles: Well, you are a man. She is a goddess... whose bedroom is, after all, only forty-one steps from your own. "
"Frasier: On a completely unrelated topic, where's Maris? "
"Niles: The last I saw, she was apologizing to one of the other candidate's wives. Apparently, Maris bumped an entire chafing dish of crabmeat into the poor woman's décolletage. "
"Frasier: Accidents will happen. "
"Niles: Yes. As long as they keep the hors d'oeuvres flowing, they will. "
"Frasier: My god Niles, feel this leather Oh, I have had pudding stiffer than this "
"Niles: Oh, Frasier Kenneth Spencer "
"Frasier: Yes, Niles, I'm sure it was very satisfying being Phi Beta Kappa at Yale, but surely you would have been happier to wear the orange and black of Princeton. "
"Niles: Of course, anyone who's anyone went to Princeton. "
"Spencer: Excuse me, I'm Kenneth Spencer. I couldn't help but overhear you. As it happens, I went to Princeton. "
"Niles: Oh, no "
"Niles: What are the odds? "
"Frasier: Allow me. I'm Dr. Frasier Crane, and this is my brother, Dr. Niles Crane, the eminent psychiatrist. "
"Niles: My brother is too kind. He was already eminent when my eminence was merely imminent. "
"Daphne: Here, try this caviar, Frasier. "
"Frasier: Thanks. "
"Daphne: I'm sorry it took so long, but I met the most charming gentleman, Edgar Van Cortland. "
"Frasier: Van Cortland? I thought he lost his membership in the S & L scandal. "
"Spencer: Actually, he was acquitted of all charges and reinstated in the club. "
"Frasier: Oh, he was innocent? "
"Spencer: No, just acquitted. "
"Niles: So does that mean that there's only one membership? "
"Spencer: Yes - oh, but not to worry. If one of you should be selected, you can always bring the other along as a guest. "
"Niles: Well, if only one of us can be honored with a membership, I hope it will be you, Frasier. "
"Spencer: That's a very noble sentiment. "
"Niles: Well, I know how much it means to him. We can't risk another splashy suicide attempt. "
"Frasier: That's very amusing, Niles, using humor to defuse a tense situation. I'm sure that stood you in good stead when you were in prison for threatening the president. "
"Drake: Kenneth? Kenneth "
"Spencer: Excuse me. "
"Daphne: Oh, stop it Do you intend to stand there running each other down and ruin both your chances? "
"Frasier: No, no. "
"Niles: Of course you're right. "
"Daphne: Thank you. "
"Wentworth: Cocktails, gentlemen? "
"Frasier: Oh, yes, I'd like two ounces of your best 18-year-old Lowland single malt scotch. "
"Drake: There's a discriminating choice. "
"Niles: Yes, my brother has an extensive knowledge of fine wines and spirits - undoubtedly acquired during the years when he was shacked up with a barmaid. "
"Roz: So my mom says, “how come you never bring your boyfriends out to meet me?” And I say, “Mom, the plane trip to Wisconsin takes four hours, and that’s longer than most of my relationships last.” "
"Frasier: Oh, there’s Niles. No, don't look at him Pretend we don't even see him. "
"Roz: Real mature, Frasier. "
"Frasier: Thanks to that backstabber, I will never get to say the phrase I've been rehearsing for a "
"lifetime: “If you need me, I'll be at my club.” "
"Roz: Frasier, this is so boring Don't you both owe each other an apology? "
"Frasier: Well, yes But I was the first to apologize last time. Oh, wait - that means it's his turn Oh, goody, I can be mature about this "
"Frasier: Niles. "
"Niles: Frasier. "
"Frasier: After last night's behavior, I believe an apology is in order. "
"Niles: I agree... Well? "
"Frasier: “Well,” what? "
"Niles: It's your turn. I apologized first last time. "
"Frasier: No, you didn’t "
"Niles: I did so I distinctly remember. It was after that shouting match at the Monet exhibit. I had my secretary leave a heartfelt apology with your service. "
"Frasier: So you did. That means it is my turn again... Damn I'm sorry. "
"Niles: Me too "
"Frasier: I can't believe we just turned on each other like that. "
"Niles: It was embarrassing. My only excuse is that all my life, I have dreamed of belonging to an exclusive club like the Empire. Even as a child, when I formed clubs with my teddy bears, there were always two or three who didn't make the cut. "
"Niles: Hello? Yes, this is Dr. Crane. It's the club. Yes? I see. Well, thank you for considering me. If you’d care to speak to my brother he's right here. Be gracious. "
"Frasier: Hello? Yes, I see. Thank you very much for calling. Goodbye. "
"Niles: Don't let it get you down. We got along fine without them before and we'll get along fine now. We are getting along without them, aren't we? "
"Frasier: Niles... "
"Niles: Oh my god... you got in. "
"Niles: ...Congratulations. I'd better go break the news to Maris. "
"Frasier: Believe me, Niles, your getting passed up like this has drained every drop of joy from this. "
"Niles: Thank you. You're a good brother. "
"Frasier: YES I got in, I got in I got... shout it from the rooftops Lattes for everyone This is the proudest day of my life "
"Frasier: Of course, what really matters is family. "
"TO: "
"Martin: Beg Come on, boy, we've been working on this, you can do it. Beg? "
"Martin: Sit Good boy "
"Frasier: Dad, what are you doing? "
"Martin: I'm teaching Eddie a new trick. "
"Frasier: With my twenty-six-dollar-a-pound imported prosciutto? "
"Martin: Aw, wait'll you see it. It's worth it "
"Frasier: Not unless he can sing the love duet from Tosca. "
"Martin: Where you going? "
"Frasier: Down to the Empire Club. I've come to a moral decision. I'm going to insist that they give Niles my membership. "
"Martin: Wow That's a hell of a gesture. "
"Frasier: Yes well, I put myself in Niles' place. After all, he’s spent the last fifteen years diligently trying to climb Seattle's social ladder, then I waltz in and within two years I'm known throughout the city. To top it all off, I end up grabbing the prize he's wanted most of all. It just isn't fair. "
"Martin: You're a good kid, Frasier. "
"Frasier: Thank you, Dad. I might as well say this while I still "
"can: 'If anyone needs me... I'll be at my club.' "
"Daphne: Oh, yes, the club. The club that I helped you get into. Of course, now that you’re done with me, I’m just cast aside... unappreciated, unloved, and forgotten. "
"Frasier: Yes well, I see the prosciutto isn’t the only imported ham in the house. "
"Daphne: Give me your shirt. I'm not going down without a full load. Have you got anything white? "
"Martin: Yeah, but you're not getting 'em. "
"Daphne: Hello, Dr. Crane. "
"Niles: Hello, Daphne. Hello, Dad. "
"Martin: Niles. "
"Niles: Just passed Frasier in the hall. Where was he off to? "
"Martin: He went to the Club. "
"Niles: No wonder he was evasive. I hope you don't mind my stopping by. I just had to get out of the house, and Lord knows I had no place else to go. "
"Martin: You know, Niles, you may get into that club yet. "
"Niles: What are you talking about? "
"Martin: That's why Frasier went down "
"there: to tell them to give his spot to you. "
"Niles: Dad, is this one of your sick jokes? "
"Martin: Well, I thought you'd be happy He's giving up his own membership. "
"Niles: What exactly did you think I would be happy about? This is humiliating – my big brother going down there to make them take me? "
"Martin: Well, his heart's in the right place. You could show a little gratitude. "
"Niles: Dad, they made their decision. If they didn't take me on my own merits I certainly don't want them to take me out of pity. I don't care if they invite me now, I don't even care if they beg "
"Martin: Good boy "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Excuse me, is the club president here? "
"Wentworth: Yes, Dr. Crane. Mr. Drake is over there. "
"Frasier: Thank you. "
"Frasier: Excuse me, Mr. Drake? "
"Drake: Yes? "
"Frasier: Dr. Frasier Crane. "
"Drake: Oh yes, of course The new blood. Please, sit down. "
"Frasier: Thank you. Sir, I've come here on a matter of personal business. It's about my brother, Niles. You see, Niles is a sort of... Oh... ohhhh Oh my God This leather’s as soft as a baby's bottom "
"Drake: Yes, on family night we bring the babies in and do a blindfold comparison test. "
"Drake: That's a joke, Crane. "
"Frasier: Oh, yes Yes, indeed, yes. Darned good one too, sir. Yes, as I was saying, although my brother may seem a bit priggish at times, believe me, he's one of the most discriminating people I've ever known. In fact, I think you'd be hard pressed to find a bigger snob in this room, I mean... "
"Wentworth: Excuse me, sir, I thought you might enjoy a glass of port. "
"Frasier: 1896? "
"Drake: What are you trying to say, Crane? "
"Frasier: No, no, no... No, I came down here to simply say that my brother deserves membership more than I do, and I would like to step down in his favor. "
"Drake: Are you serious? "
"Frasier: Yes, yes I am... after all, blood is thicker than port. I stand corrected "
"Drake: Let me be candid with you, Crane. We all liked your brother, but some were quite firm about accepting anybody in the entertainment business. I'm afraid “radio psychiatrist” falls into that category. "
"Frasier: Radio psychiatrist? But Niles... "
"hear: "
"Frasier: Mr. Drake, there's been a terrible mistake. "
"Niles: No, Frasier, there hasn't. "
"Frasier: Niles "
"Niles: Dad told me you would be here, trying to get me into your snooty little club. Well, you needn't bother. "
"Frasier: Niles, you don't understand "
"Niles: No, you don't understand You don't need to be the big brother anymore. I don't need you to fight my battles "
"Frasier: But, Niles- "
"Niles: No, butt out "
"Frasier: Okay... "
"Niles: And as for you, you've made it quite clear how you feel about me, so I'd like to share how I feel about you. I'd sooner spend my leisure time in a smelly bus station than spend one moment with you smug, elitist bigwigs, with your clichéd oriental carpets and your overstuffed chairs. My God, it's like a baby's bottom You can't reject me, because I reject you Yes, I’m talking to you, Fuzzy I prefer to remain Niles Crane, Everyman. [he throws his arm over Wentworth's shoulders] Friend of the average Joe. "
"Frasier: Niles, they got our names mixed up. I didn't get in, you did. "
"Niles: What? "
"Frasier: It was you they wanted all along. "
"Niles: Really? I'm in? Good God, don't just stand there, man, fetch me some port and step lively "
"Drake: Will you escort these gentlemen out? "
"Niles: Oh, no, no, no, no... [sits in chair, and begins to rub his cheek on the wing] You can't think that I meant those things that I was saying before. "
"Wentworth: Excuse me, sir, I'm afraid I must ask you to leave. "
"Niles: You and who else? "
"Niles: Ah... "
"Frasier: Niles, come along. We don't need this club. Let us leave with the dignity with which we came. "
"Niles: "
"Niles: But-but no... there's, there's been a misunderstanding, I do want to be one of you. Perhaps you could put me on probation... "
"Niles: I could just come part time, or perhaps afternoons, or just one afternoon - Thursday's a slow day - or you can pick the day, I wouldn't even have to talk to anyone, I could just sit in a chair and not say a word... "
"Niles: Please, please, please Oh, let me stay, I belong here "

"Frasier: Brian, let me assure you. No one is a born scatterbrain You simply have to develop your powers of concentration. On a trip to the Amazon I was able to observe the hunters of the primitive Shipibo tribe. With nothing more than a crude blowgun they can bring down small monkeys from the forest canopy high above their heads. How? "
"Frasier: Focus, and mental discipline. And that’s what we have to work on, Brian. Focus on one thing and not allow ourselves to be distracted by a single- [Roz rushes in excited and shows Frasier the piece of paper] WE’VE BEEN NOMINATED FOR A SEABEA "
"Frasier: Of course, we should never become so single-minded that we don’t allow ourselves to be spontaneous. We’ll be back right after this. "
"Frasier: Oh, Roz. This is wonderful. They like me, they really like me. "
"Roz: Oh my God, I have to lose five pounds in two weeks. "
"Frasier: [taking the bar of chocolate that Roz is eating out of her hands] Well, that’ll be enough of that "
"Frasier: Roz. Listen, I bought this for you this morning and I was hoping that I wouldn’t have to say this was just for being you... "
"Roz: Oh thanks, Frasier. This is so great. You know, last year I was so obsessed with winning that I didn’t even enjoy being nominated. But this year I don’t care if we win or lose. I’m just gonna buy myself a beautiful dress and have my hair done and I’m gonna stretch out in the back of a limo with my date... "
"Frasier: And wonder why you bothered having your hair done "
"Bulldog: Hey, Doc. Congratulations Hey, Roz... "
"Frasier: Well, I understand congratulations are in order for you as well, Bulldog. What is this now? Four nominations, three wins? "
"Bulldog: Yeah. I’ve been a symbol of broadcasting excellence in Seattle since 1991. "
"Bulldog: See ya, Doc. "
"Roz: Thirty seconds. "
"Frasier: Thank you, Roz. Whom do we have? "
"Roz: On line one we have a shoplifter from Bainbridge, and then line two is your number one fan. "
"Frasier: Oh, Kari. "
"Roz: Mmm-hmm, for the fourth time this week. Why don’t you let me get rid of her? All she ever does is gush and tell you how wonderful you are. "
"Frasier: And this hurts me how? "
"Frasier: Hello Seattle, we’re back. Got time for just one more call. So, Roz – who do we have on the line? "
"Roz: Oh, please "
"Frasier: Hello. You’re on with Frasier Crane. "
"Kari: Hi, Dr. Crane. It’s me, Kari. Nervous as usual. Anyway, I hope you’re not getting sick of me. I just think you’re wonderful. Thank you for always talking to me. "
"Frasier: Well, thank you for being so sweet. "
"Kari: Well, thank you for giving such good advice. "
"Frasier: Well, thank you for being... "
"Frasier: If that’s all? "
"Kari: That was a beautiful rose you bought this morning. "
"Frasier: Yes, I bought it to give to... Excuse me? "
"Kari: Don’t be surprised. I saw you at the florist’s. You weren’t doing your regular routine. "
"Frasier: My regular routine? "
"Kari: Café Nervosa. You go there every morning. Except today. I can tell I’m boring you now. Bye "
"Frasier: Well, goodbye Kari. Well that’s all our time for today, Seattle. Goodbye and good listening. "
"Roz: That was pretty weird. Now she’s following you? "
"Frasier: I don’t think it’s so weird. It’s hardly following. Maybe she hangs out at Café Nervosa too and the florist is right next door. "
"Roz: Well, be careful out there. There’s a lot of creeps. "
"Frasier: Oh Roz I hate that word, “creeps.” There’s a lot of odd people in this business. I never refer to any of them as a “creep.” "
"Bulldog: Hey Roz, will you stop wearing those corduroys? I can’t see your pantyline. "
"Frasier: Although some people do send me groping for synonyms. "
"Frasier: Ah, what are you up to? "
"Daphne: I just measured your Father for his tuxedo. "
"Niles: Oh Frasier, that reminds me. I’m afraid Maris won’t be able to make your SeaBea awards tomorrow night. "
"Frasier: Well, I can hardly be surprised. Any particular reason? "
"Niles: Yes And this time it’s a good one. She’s very upset about her manicurist. The woman’s been doing Maris’s nails for years now and sadly she was just taken critically ill. "
"Daphne: Oh, dear. How bad is she? "
"Niles: She’ll be fine once she finds another manicurist Until then she’s curtailing all public appearances. "
"Frasier: Yes, well I’m sorry. It’s not like I’m nominated for a SeaBea every year. Oh, wait a minute – yes, it is "
"Niles: Well, as some illustrious person once said, 'popularity is the hallmark of mediocrity.' "
"Frasier: You just made that up, didn’t you? "
"Niles: Yes, but I stand by it. "
"Daphne: Will you be joining us for dinner tonight, Dr. Crane? "
"Niles: No. Frasier and I are going to the opera. We’re seeing- "
"Niles: Der Fliegende Hollander. "
"Niles: Oh, don’t forget – the tickets are in your briefcase. I can hear that first aria already. [starts humming the tune] "
"Martin: Don’t, Niles. You’ll start singing it, then I’ll start singing it, and I won’t be able to get it out of my head. "
"Frasier: What’s this? “Dear Dr. Crane. A little bit of me to wrap around your neck. Your number one fan, Kari.” "
"Daphne: Oh, how sweet. Your fan knitted you a scarf. "
"Frasier: Yes, but when did she find the time to put it in my briefcase? I haven’t had it out of my hand all day except when I was in the barber’s chair. "
"Martin: Hell, that didn’t give her more than thirty seconds "
"Niles: So you’re saying this woman followed you into the barber shop then slipped a scarf into your briefcase. "
"Frasier: Well, she’s a very devoted fan. "
"Niles: She has the handwriting of a sociopath. "
"Frasier: Oh, she does not. "
"Niles: Big loops. "
"Daphne: That’s exactly how Scotland Yard caught “The Butcher of Brighton.” He used big loops – a clear sign of anger. And he crossed his t’s in a downward stroke, indicating aggression. Of course, he also kept a demitasse saucer full of eyelids on his night table. "
"Frasier: Anybody here besides me think we should put a two-way lock on her door? "
"Martin: Well, if you ask me it’s probably nothing, but there are some weirdos out there, so just keep your eyes open. "
"Frasier: Dad, she’s not a weirdo. She’s just a woman who finds me utterly fascinating "
"Niles: And the distinction would be? "
"Frasier: In any case, I do think that her invading my space is inappropriate. I hardly think we should start barricading the door. "
"Niles: Let’s review. She started with calls to the station, then moved onto spying on you. Now she’s been in your briefcase. It’s the classic progression of the predator stalking its prey in ever-narrowing circles, or “loops.” That’s for you, Daphne. "
"Daphne: Thank you. "
"Frasier: Niles, you make me sound like a goat staked out in a clearing. No one is hunting me down. No one is closing in on me. "
"Frasier: Oh, look. These must be from the station. “From your number one fan Kari. Your time has come. You’re finally going to get what you deserve.” "
"Niles: The loop tightens "
"Frasier: Stop it, Niles. She’s probably just referring to the fact that it’s time I win this award. Try as you will, you are not going to turn me into some sort of a nervous wreck. "
"Frasier: It’s just not going to happen "
"TO: "
"Madman: I don’t understand it, Doc. I’m a successful guy. I have my own car dealership but still I’m depressed. You’ve probably heard of me – Madman Martinez. "
"Frasier: Well, what seems to be the source of your depression, Madman? "
"Madman: I guess it’s just that business is down. I don’t know why. I slashed prices this week. Right now I got an ’88 old Cutlass on the lot in rare turquoise metallic, Cordoba roof, leather, factory year... "
"Frasier: Madman... "
"Madman: And that’s nothing compared to the six brand new Super’s I got in. Their prices... "
"Frasier: Maybe... "
"Madman: Twenty-percent discount to all your listeners People say to me, “Madman, you’re crazy.” I say, “HEY, I DEAL IN VOLUME” "
"Frasier: Fortunately, so do I. Well, that’s about all the time we have today, folks. Stay tuned for Bob 'Bulldog' Briscoe after these paid commercial messages. "
"Frasier: Roz, what is the matter with you? You’re supposed to be screening these calls "
"Roz: Just dowse me in gasoline and toss me a match. "
"Frasier: I was hoping a stern warning would do the trick. "
"Roz: I’m talking about this Three hours until the limo picks me up for the SeaBeas and my nose erupts like Krakatoa "
"Frasier: It’s barely noticeable. "
"Roz: From where, the Space Shuttle? Vintage Roz or what? I finally lose five pounds and I gain three of it back on my nose "
"Frasier: Roz, I’m sure that with enough foundation and some contouring, maybe a little shadowing... [realises he is fighting a lost cause] Have you considered wearing a beekeeper’s mask? "
"Roz: Do I make fun of that Astrodome you call a forehead? "
"Frasier: Gee, Roz. It’s been sort of a tough week for me too, you know? Kari has taken to putting notes in my briefcase. She’s even been to my apartment. "
"Roz: Frasier, you’ve got to do something. Don’t you remember Leo, the Happy Chef? He had an obsessed fan too. It started out innocently just like yours and she ended up breaking into his house. "
"Frasier: Yes, I understand she bent his whisk and scratched all his Teflon "
"Roz: Make fun all you want, but she made his life miserable and she didn’t quit until he hired himself a bodyguard. Want me to find out who he is? "
"Frasier: No, no, no. I have a hard time believing that Kari poses a real threat. I mean she doesn’t even have the nerve to come up and look at me face to face. Lord knows she’s had the opportunity. "
"Roz: Well, suit yourself. If you ask me the woman is acting very weird. "
"Frasier: Tea good for your nose? "
"Roz: No, I finally found a bag to match my shoes "
"Frasier: Roz, you’re dripping all over the console "
"Frasier: Kari? "
"Roz: Again? How did she get in your jacket? "
"Frasier: I have no idea. “I’m very disappointed in you, Dr. Crane. You didn’t wear the scarf I knitted you even though it was very cold. The last man who disappointed me that way... is in his grave. P.S. – I’ll be at the awards tonight and I’ll be looking for you. Your number one fan, Kari.” "
"Roz: Oh, great. I’m sitting at your table with a bulls-eye on my nose "
"Daphne: Now, now, Dr. Crane you’ve really got to try to relax. "
"Frasier: Oh, you’re right, Daphne. After all, what do I have to be nervous about? I’m only up for a major award. If I lose I’ll be devastated. If I win then a madwoman who’s been stalking me will have a clear shot when I accept "
"Daphne: Oh, don’t worry about it so. That’s what you hired a bodyguard for. "
"Martin: I still don’t see why. Most likely nothing’s gonna happen, and even if it does I was a cop for thirty years. This whole thing’s a waste of money. "
"Frasier: Dad, there’s a big difference between a policeman and a skilled bodyguard. These people are trained to size up a crowd, plan escape routes, even get shot if necessary. "
"Martin: Hey, I know how to take a bullet. "
"Frasier: Oh yes, that’s just what your personality needs – another bullet "
"Frasier: That must be him. Who is it, please? "
"Niles: Lizzie Borden. I want you to autograph my hatchet. "
"Frasier: That’s not very funny. "
"Niles: Everyone ready to go? "
"Martin: Nah, we’re still waiting for his rent-a-goon. "
"Frasier: Apparently he’s stuck in traffic. "
"Niles: Perhaps your admirer ran into him first and he’s stuffed in some janitor’s closet, his purple bloated tongue protruding above his freshly garroted neck. Is that champagne? "
"Frasier: Well, you’re a fountain of comfort this evening. "
"Niles: Oh, I’m just teasing. If you must know I’m a little jealous. I told Maris about your troubles. All she does is sulk and talk about bodyguards. 'Why don’t we need one? Aren’t we important enough to be stalked?' I have no idea what to say to the poor woman. "
"Martin: Tell her to just go on being herself and her day will come. "
"Frasier: That must be my muscle. "
"Frasier: Dear God, it’s a woman. Where’s my bodyguard when I need him? "
"Woman: Hello? It’s Cindy Carruthers from The Unified Protection Agency. "
"Martin: Your bodyguard’s name is Cindy? What’s the matter – they were all out of Tiffany’s? "
"Frasier: I was expecting someone big and wide like a Dominic, a Rocko, a Ruth even. "
"Frasier: Hello. So glad to see you. "
"Cindy: Thank you Dr. Crane, but you just made a fatal mistake. "
"Frasier: Oh my God, it is Kari "
"Cindy: No. I mean you should have called The Agency and asked for a description before you let me in. "
"Cindy: Hi, Tina. Bring the car around to the service entrance. "
"Frasier: Tina? "
"Martin: I guess Candy was busy. "
"Cindy: First rule for tonight is, trust no one you don’t know. "
"Martin: Ooh, let me write that down. "
"Frasier: I suppose you’re right. I just start to feel silly when I act paranoid. "
"Cindy: Don’t. Paranoid is good. "
"Niles: I was paranoid. "
"Cindy: Who are these people? "
"Frasier: This is my brother Dr. Niles Crane, my father Martin and his home care specialist Daphne Moon. "
"Daphne: Goodness. You’ve seen quite a bit of mayhem in your day. "
"Cindy: Excuse me? "
"Daphne: Well you see, I can sense these things. I’m a bit psychic. Wait, I’m getting a flash now... Did you have a grandfather with a steel plate in his head? "
"Cindy: This lunatic who’s been calling you – any particular accent? "
"Frasier: No, no. "
"Cindy: You have a security system in this place? "
"Daphne: We don’t need a security system. We’ve got Eddie here. "
"Cindy: Hello, Eddie. "
"Martin: Don’t let him fool you. You lay a hand on me, you’d have a bite on your butt the size of a tennis ball. "
"Frasier: And Eddie would go for your ankles "
"Daphne: My, look at the time. Shouldn’t we be going? "
"Cindy: You’d better let me secure the elevator. Wait here and don’t open the door for anyone. By the way Dr. Crane, I’ll need to know your blood type, location of the nearest trauma center and a list of any family members who’d be willing to donate organs. "
"Niles: Just so you know, Frasier, I have unusually small kidneys. "
"Daphne: Hello, Crane residence... [puts her hand over the mouthpiece] I think it’s her "
"Frasier: Niles – call Cindy. Put it on speaker. "
"Frasier: Hello. "
"Kari: Hi. I know you’re in a hurry but I just wanted to let you know I’ll be wearing a bright red dress tonight. "
"Frasier: Kari? "
"Kari: But don’t worry. You won’t have to find me – I’ll find you. "
"Kari: Bye. "
"Frasier: Kari, wait. "
"Daphne: Oh, don’t let it bother you so. Come on, let’s go. Quite frankly I find it hard to imagine a woman with such a sweet little voice being dangerous. "
"Martin: Does the name Squeaky Fromme mean anything to you? "
"TO: "
"Cindy: Alright, we’re seeing a lot of red dresses here, so let’s go over some ground "
"rules: Don’t go anywhere alone. If you have to go to the men’s room, go with a 'buddy' and keep your back to the wall at all times. "
"Martin: It’s gonna take some marksmanship right there. "
"Cindy: Don’t move, but I think I see her. Red dress standing by the bar. She’s staring at every man who comes in here but she’s hiding her face behind a program. "
"Frasier: That is my producer Roz. She’s harmless. She just has a pimple on her nose. Looks like some kind of biblical plague "
"Frasier: Roz, Roz, over here. Oh, give me that, will you? You look beautiful. Come join us. "
"Cindy: Hi, I’m Cindy Carruthers. "
"Roz: Hi. Hi. "
"Martin: Hi "
"Frasier: Stop that Now Roz, listen, you look terrific. You’ve done a wonderful little job with your problem there. It’s practically disappeared. "
"Bulldog: Whoa, Roz Won’t you guide my sleigh tonight? "
"Bulldog: And who’s this lovely lady? "
"Cindy: Cindy Carruthers. "
"Frasier: Careful. She has a concealed weapon. "
"Bulldog: Makes two of us. "
"Martin: He’s not kidding. She’s his bodyguard. "
"Bulldog: Hey. How’d you like to check out a body worth guarding? "
"Cindy: If I move my thumb a quarter of an inch, I could kill you. "
"Bulldog: Whoa I’ve never been so turned on in my life. "
"Bulldog: Ow, ow OK, let me go. So can I call you? "
"Frasier: You know, I wish this woman would just make her move. I hate this looking over my shoulder thinking it could be anyone. "
"Niles: At least you know she’s wearing a red dress. "
"Martin: Maybe. "
"Niles: What do you mean, 'maybe'? "
"Martin: Well, I’m no professional bodyguard, but if I was a loony toon looking to whack a guy, you know maybe I just wouldn’t tell the truth about what I was wearing. "
"Cindy: No offence to your father, but I think you should stick to looking for a woman in a red dress. "
"Daphne: Here we are. Good as new. "
"Cindy: Well, should we all head up to the ballroom? "
"Frasier: All right. "
"Roz: Help me "
"Frasier: Niles, just hear me out on this. Didn’t it seem curious to you that Cindy was so quick to dismiss Dad’s theory? Cindy who is not wearing a red dress? "
"Niles: Frasier, you can’t think that she’s the... "
"Frasier: Shh "
"Niles: Well she couldn’t be the... "
"Frasier: Shh "
"Niles: Well, how... "
"Frasier: SHH Think about it. She was conveniently out of the apartment at precisely the moment the stalker phoned. "
"Niles: So she was. And we know she has a cellular phone. That’s how she called for the car. "
"Frasier: What if it is Cindy? Why hasn’t she made her move? "
"Niles: Maybe she’s waiting to get you alone. "
"Cindy: Too many red dresses in there. We’ll take our own elevator. "
"Cindy: Don’t be nervous. "
"Frasier: Oh, I’m not nervous. I’m just a little chilly. It’s a cold night. "
"Cindy: Should have worn a scarf "
"Frasier: Yes, I suppose I should have. Believe me, I meant to. Honest. Where is that elevator? "
"Cindy: You know I asked for this assignment? Truth is, I’m quite a fan of yours. But I guess you figured that out already? "
"Frasier: Oh my God "
"Cindy: What? "
"Frasier: There "
"Cindy: Where? "
"Frasier: There, behind the bar "
"Woman: Frasier Crane? I’ve been waiting for this moment for a long time. I’m your number one fan. "
"Frasier: Roz, Roz, find Cindy "
"Woman: Help me, please Get him off me "
"Roz: Frasier, are you insane? This is Mrs. Littlejohn – the Head of the Nominations Committee. "
"Niles: Emilia Littlejohn? This is a small world. I know your brother Aubrey "
"Frasier: Oh, I’m so sorry Mrs. Littlejohn. You see, it’s just that, I’m being stalked by this woman named Kari and when you said that you’d been waiting for me, I... "
"Littlejohn: To get an autograph for my niece "
"Frasier: Oh, well, who’s got a pen? "
"Roz: Let’s hope we win this year because we’re not getting nominated next year "
"Niles: Roz, are you doing something different with your hair? "
"Cindy: What happened? Why did you run away from me? "
"Frasier: Oh, I’ll tell you what happened. The paranoia has turned me into a crazy person. First I though you were the stalker. Then I thought she was the stalker, [pointing towards Mrs. Littlejohn] You know, I’ve had enough of this. I’m gonna confront this thing face to face. "
"Frasier: Everyone I will be in the lobby. "
"Martin: Frasier, calm down... "
"Frasier: I WILL BE IN THE LOBBY "
"Martin: You’re Kari, aren’t you? "
"Kari: How did you know? "
"Martin: You made a scarf just like that for Frasier. He’s my son. "
"Kari: I think there’s been a big misunderstanding. I’m just a fan. I never meant to frighten him. "
"Martin: Well, what about that note – about the last guy who didn’t wear the scarf ended up in his grave? "
"Kari: That was my husband Walter. He caught pneumonia. I won’t bother your son anymore. Could you just tell him what happened? "
"Martin: I’ll be glad to explain and, if I’m lucky, he won’t understand and I’ll have to explain all over again. "
"Kari: I’m sure he’ll understand. That’s the one thing about your son, Mr. Crane – he’s so smart and level-headed. "
"Martin: What’s she been smoking? "
"TO: Lobby "
"Frasier: Well, I’m here – you demented harpy. Come and get me. "
"Frasier: Kari? "
"Frasier: Alright, I know you’re down here. Come on out and face me Not so brave anymore, huh? You think you’re tough but you’re only tough as long as you’re hiding in the shadows. You wanna see who’s really tough? You just come on out here "
"Frasier: When I said 'tough' I was speaking clearly in a rhetorical sense. "
"Frasier: Would... er... any of you happen to have the time? "
"Frasier: Would any of you like the time? "

"Frasier: Well, that's it for today. Goodbye, and good listening. "
"Frasier: Little off our game today, aren't we, Roz? Is something wrong? "
"Roz: Yes. I told a guy I love him. "
"Frasier: Somebody you know this time? "
"Roz: Forget it, Frasier, I know you don't like to hear about my love-life. "
"Frasier: Oh, Roz, don't be ridiculous. I care about you. If you have a problem, and I can help, I'd love to. Just keep the details on a need-to-know basis. "
"Roz: OK. We've been dating a couple of weeks, and last night he started licking me behind my ear. See, I have this sweet little spot there... "
"Frasier: Uh, Roz, is this—? "
"Roz: Yes, you do need to know this. So anyway, what I meant to say was, 'Oh, I love that' But I got so caught up that I yelled out, 'Oh, I love you' and then all of a sudden he got this look on his face like Indiana Jones running from the big ball "
"Frasier: Well, uh, Roz, do you love him? "
"Roz: No But I said it, so he should have said it back, it's just polite. "
"Frasier: There is no more emotionally charged phrase in the language than 'I love you.' Some people are just incapable of saying it, it makes them too vulnerable. My father, for instance, incapable of saying 'I love you,' even to me. But I know he does. "
"Roz: So your father never told you he loves you? God, that explains so much. "
"Frasier: What is that supposed to mean? "
"Roz: Well, maybe if he had, you wouldn't be so emotionally needy that when a close friend asks your advice, you have to steer the conversation back to your own problems. So anyway, now that I told this guy I love him, how do I take it back? "
"Frasier: Very simple, Roz. Do you remember when I said that I cared about you and I'd like to help? "
"Roz: Yeah? "
"Frasier: I take it back. "
"Martin: Eddie, get out of there You'll get a fishhook up your nose "
"Daphne: Don't you ever clean that thing out? "
"Martin: No It's bad luck. Everybody knows that. You show up on a fishing trip with a tackle box that doesn't smell like the most rancid, rotten thing on the face of the earth, and nobody'll sit next to you. "
"Frasier: Yes, Niles, I used to have the same problem with my multiple personality patients. They always kept saying that the other one had sent the check "
"Niles: What an odd combination of odors. Smells like a fish died, and all the other fish sent flowers. "
"Frasier: Yes, it's time for Dad's annual ice-fishing trip to Lake Nomahegan. "
"Martin: Yep, I'm getting my gear ready. Duke rented a cabin right on the lake, and I'm bringing the bait and the pork rinds. Now, just 'cause your old man's going out of town, I don't want you boys throwing any wild parties. "
"Frasier: How can we if you're taking all the pork rinds? "
"Niles: I can't figure it out. How could a fish be so dumb as to put its mouth around — Ow "
"Daphne: Hello? Oh, hello Yes, he's right here. It's Duke. "
"Martin: Oh Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah, sure I understand. Hey, we'll do it next year. Yeah, we've had too many good times up there to let this tradition die. Yeah, yeah, I love ya, you big lug OK, bye. "
"Daphne: Your trip's been canceled? "
"Martin: Yeah, Duke's back's out again. "
"Daphne: Oh, what a shame. You were so looking forward to it. "
"Martin: Well, I still have the cabin. But I can't go alone... "
"Frasier: Dad, look, as much as I'd like to do something with you this weekend, I'm afraid ice fishing just isn't it. Oh, look, look, here's an idea You know what, they're doing a revival of 'The Iceman Cometh' playing downtown Now, you see, we could catch a matinee, and then go out for sushi, and stay well within the same theme music, you know? "
"Martin: Thanks, anyway. "
"Daphne: Well, I'd go, but to me the pleasure of fishing has always been waiting for the men to return with their catch. Oh, I can still see my brothers' friends coming back from the lake, their chiseled faces all ruddy and wind-burnt. Ooh, they were so masculine, I just couldn't wait to panfry their kippers "
"clockwork: "
"Niles: I'll go ice fishing, Dad "
"Martin: Really, are you sure? "
"Niles: Unless you don't want me to... "
"Martin: No, I do Oh, this'll be great "
"Frasier: You, ice-fishing? "
"Niles: Well, why not? I've always thought of myself as a man of the great al fresco. "
"Frasier: Niles, you get a runny nose watching figure skating on TV. "
"Martin: Hey, thanks, Niles. "
"Niles: It's the very least I can do if it'll help save your trip for you. "
"Frasier: Yes, well, Niles, that's quite a gesture. But I mean, really, ice-fishing? In an arctic tundra where large men spit and it freezes in their beards? "
"Niles: After you've seen Maris's interpretive dance group perform 'Afternoon of a Faun' in the east garden, the wilderness holds no terror. "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Morning, Daphne. "
"Daphne: Good morning Lovely day, isn't it? "
"Frasier: Well, you're in a good mood. "
"Daphne: Yes, well, as much as I love your father, with him gone it's going to be a wonderful weekend... care to make it perfect? "
"Frasier: I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I am staying. "
"Martin: Well, I found the thermos Be sure to make that coffee extra- strong "
"Martin: Oh, hey, how you doing, chief? Yeah, I know you want to go with me, but we're gonna be on the ice, it'll be too cold for you. Yeah, I love ya, you little mutt Well, I better go make sure I have everything. "
"Frasier: Did he just say 'I love you' to the dog? "
"Daphne: Oh, that's nothing. I had an aunt who used to say, 'good night, Mr. Vanderpump' to a hat rack. "
"Frasier: Does he say that to Eddie a lot? "
"Daphne: Well, I try to give them their privacy. "
"Frasier: I'm sorry, Daphne, I’m just curious. I don't mean to sound maudlin, but, you know I can't remember Dad ever saying that to me. "
"Daphne: Oh, you know what a crusty old git your dad is. "
"Frasier: Well, yes, but he says it to Eddie, you know he said it to Duke the other day on the phone... "
"Daphne: Duke and your father go way back. He's his chum. "
"Frasier: And I'm not? "
"Daphne: Well, you know when your dad wants to go fishing, at least Duke will go with him. "
"Frasier: So you're suggesting that I go along and pretend I'm enjoying myself, doing something that gives me absolutely no pleasure at all, just to hear the words 'I love you?' "
"Daphne: Why not? Women have been doing it for centuries. "
"Niles: Call me Ishmael. "
"Martin: Wow, Niles, look at you Now are you sure you're gonna be warm enough? "
"Niles: No problem there. I dressed in layers — Polo, Eddie Bauer, and Timberland. "
"Frasier: You look like a skinny Elmer Fudd. "
"Niles: Dad, wait'll you see all the stuff I got. I had no idea how much I liked fishing until I realized all the shopping involved. Graphite poles... "
"Martin: Wow "
"Niles: And, Hot Buns "
"Martin: Wow "
"Niles: They're heated seat cushions. You microwave them and they stay toasty warm for hours. "
"Frasier: You know, Dad, maybe I was a little hasty... "
"Daphne: All right, here we are, some snacks for the trip, or— [sees Niles and laughs] Oh, Dr. Crane, look at you in your new togs "
"Martin: Yeah, quite an outfit, huh? The fish'll see him coming "
"Daphne: Yes, well, the salesman certainly did "
"Frasier: Dad, you know, I feel kind of bad that I turned you down when you invited me... "
"Martin: Oh, don't worry about it. "
"Niles: Wait'll you taste this freshly smoked turkey jerky "
"Daphne: For heaven's sakes, you know you want to go, so why don't you just ask him? "
"Frasier: How can I? I already said I didn't want to. "
"Martin: Oh, that's delicious "
"Niles: No, don't put it back in the bag "
"Martin: Hey, Niles, come on, it's getting late. "
"Niles: Well, yes, guess we'd better hit the road. "
"Frasier: You know, guys, it's kind of a long trip. Are you sure you're up to the drive? "
"Martin: Frasier, I'm getting some mixed signals here. You don't want to go with us, do you? "
"Frasier: Oh, all right Better than hearing you nag, nag, nag all the time Fine, I'll go "
"TO: "
"Martin: Hey, come on The ice isn't gonna break, this lake's been frozen solid for three months. "
"Frasier: Well, I'm-I'm sorry, Dad. It's just that when you said Duke rented a cabin 'on the lake,' this is not what I had in mind. "
"Martin: It's a cabin. It's on the lake. "
"Frasier: Yes — a few degrees warmer, it'll be IN the lake. "
"Niles: That was amazing I've never felt so in touch with nature "
"Martin: What happened? "
"Niles: For the first time in my life, I just urinated outdoors "
"Niles: Another cup of coffee, I'll go back and dot the 'I' [looks around] Oh Dad, this is great "
"Martin: Yeah... well, Frasier doesn't think so. "
"Frasier: Well, it's not that I'm complaining. It's just that I thought it would be something more... well, lake-adjacent. Are we actually going to sleep in here? "
"Niles: Who is this rube? Maybe we can trick him into touching his tongue to the bait bucket "
"Martin: No, we're fishing here, we're sleeping someplace else. Remember where we turned off the highway? Well, right down from there is the Bed 'N Bass Motel. "
"Frasier: 'Bed 'N Bass' — yes, one of the finer fish-themed hotels. "
"Frasier: So, what do we do? We make a hole in the ice with this little corkscrew-thingy and then just start fishing? "
"Niles: It's called an 'auger.' "
"Frasier: Well, imagine my embarrassment. "
"Niles: Here's your Hot Buns, Dad. "
"Martin: Oh, thanks. "
"Frasier: What am I gonna sit on? "
"Niles: The auger's free. Oh, all right, come on, come on, here. "
"TO: "
"Martin: I saw that. "
"Frasier: I'm not bored. I was simply wondering how long we've been sitting here enjoying ourselves. "
"Niles: If the fish don't feel peckish just now, we'll pass the time in good conversation. Dad, did you know that Lake Nomahegan was formed by the retreat of several glaciers during the Cenozoic Era? "
"Frasier: Which, coincidentally, is the last time anyone caught a fish in it. "
"Martin: How'd you know that, Niles? "
"Niles: Well, last night I was browsing through 'Fielding’s Geological History of Western Canada.' It's fascinating For example, did you know this very lake is eighty-nine meters deep and boasts fifty varieties of fish "
"Frasier: Oh, Alex, I'll take 'Bodies of Water' for five hundred "
"Niles: It has lake trout, rainbow trout, wall-eyed pike— "
"Frasier: How would you like to be sleeping with them? "
"Martin: Hey, you know, you could learn a thing or two from your brother about getting into the spirit of things. "
"Frasier: Well, I'm sorry, it's just that my back hurts, I'm hungry, and I'm tired of sitting here trying to warm up one bun at a time in twenty-degree weather That's negative six degrees Celsius, a system named after Anders Celsius, the famed Swedish astronomer and compulsive temperature-taker Niles, switch "
"Niles: I believe you're on my side. "
"Frasier: I am not. "
"Niles: You've crossed the border "
"Frasier: Oh my God, I don't even know why I'm here "
"Niles: I'm thinking the same thing myself. "
"Martin: Now, guys, come on "
"Niles: If you're having such a terrible time, why don't you just head back to the Bed 'N Bass? "
"Frasier: Oh fine, that's just what I need, a brisk five-mile hike through sub-freezing temperature. "
"Niles: Oh, for God's sake, take the car, you can pick us up later. "
"Frasier: Fine. "
"Niles: Oh, no. There's a hole in my pocket. "
"Martin: You lost the keys? "
"Frasier: Oh, no. Where? "
"Niles: Well, if I knew where, they wouldn't be lost They could be anywhere between here and the car. "
"Martin: Well, good luck finding them, it's been snowing all day. "
"Niles: Great — we're gonna have to stay here all night. "
"Frasier: This is just dandy By morning we'll be Stoafer's Frozen Entrées for wolves "
"Martin: Hey, wait a minute, is that them over there? "
"Niles: Where? "
"Frasier: All right, mister, I don't trust you. Give me those right now. "
"Niles: Fine, Mr. Big Brother "
"Niles: Nice catch "
"Frasier: Me? You throw like a girl "
"Martin: Hey come on, let's not panic. You know, we're gonna be fine staying here all night. You know, the same thing happened to me and Duke about ten years ago. "
"Niles: You dropped your car keys down the hole? "
"Martin: No, we're not idiots. The car battery died. But the three of us made it through the night just fine. "
"Niles: You, Duke, and who? "
"Martin: My old drinking buddy, Mr. James Beam You're not the only one who went out and got some fishing supplies. "
"Frasier: Boy, I never thought I'd end up yearning for the Bed ‘N Bass. Niles? "
"Niles: Yes, please "
"Frasier: My God, what was that? "
"Martin: Just the ice cracking underneath us. "
"Martin: Relax, it happens all the time. "
"Niles: Well, if we do fall in we'll have ninety seconds until hypothermia sets in. "
"Frasier: One more fact, you're going in that hole "
"Niles: The wall-eyed pike— "
"Frasier: OK, that's it "
"Martin: Stop it Will you guys stop going after each other already? I know, we got to lighten things up around here. Hey, we're drinking, we need a drinking song "
"Frasier: All right, all right. Ooh, I know, there's a wonderful drinking song from 'La Traviata' called, uh, 'Libiamo Brindisi' "
"Niles: No, no, no, no, that's from 'Rigoletto.' "
"Frasier: No, it's from 'La Traviata' "
"TO: "
"Martin: Si, ne scopra, ne scopra, Il nuovo di... "
"Martin: That was great What's the second verse? "
"Niles: I don't know, it's in Italian Another drink, Dad? "
"Martin: No, no, I'll take a pass on that, I got to go use the facilities. But, I'll be right back, so keep a light on in the window for me "
"Frasier: Well, I'm still thirsty, Niles. Here, 'Beam' me up. "
"Frasier: Niles, do you mind if I ask you a personal question? What the hell are you doing here? "
"Niles: What do you mean? "
"Frasier: You know, this whole 'Sergeant Niles of the Yukon' act. I mean, come on, it can't be all to impress Daphne— "
"Niles: It's not an act "
"Frasier: Niles, in twenty years, I've never heard you comment on fish except to say that the sauce had separated. "
"Niles: All right. I'll tell you. You promise not to laugh? "
"Frasier: You'll have to take that hat off. "
"Niles: Well, two years ago when you took Dad in, I thought I was getting away with something. Watching you two get closer, I started to think maybe I was missing out on something. "
"Frasier: You want him? "
"Niles: No, no, let me finish. I just really feel the need to make a connection. "
"Frasier: Well, Niles, I think you've made a connection. It just seems a little extreme though, you know? You probably could have accomplished the same thing if you'd just taken him to Captain Andy's Surf N’ Turf "
"Niles: And miss out on all the fun of memorizing 101 useless fish facts and buying a large battery-operated wardrobe? "
"Frasier: So you're having just a bad a time as I am "
"Niles: Oh, oh, oh, worse At least you have the fun of complaining, I have to feign enthusiasm Oh, oh... I really am King of the Ninnies, aren't I? "
"Frasier: Oh no. Don't be reaching for that scepter yet, son. Want to know the reason I came up here? "
"Niles: Hmm. "
"Frasier: It was just to hear him say the words 'I love you.' "
"Niles: What? "
"Frasier: Yeah, well, you know — he said it to Duke, he said it to Eddie. He's never said it to me. "
"Niles: Surely you don't put yourself up there with Eddie? Oh, Frasier, you know he loves you "
"Frasier: Oh yeah, of course I do. I'm being ridiculous, I know that. I mean, look at the guy He's content just to sit here freezing his buns off because we're sitting here with him. It’s just I guess I just got a little obsessed about, you know, hearing it. Well, I mean, you know that Maris loves you, right? But it's still nice to hear it. "
"Niles: I imagine it would be, but let's stick to attainable goals. "
"Frasier: As they laugh the laugh of the damned. "
"Martin: Hey, I did it I wrote my name out there I had to borrow an 'N' from Niles, but I did it "
"Frasier: We're leaving quite the urological crossword puzzle out there, aren't we? "
"Martin: What were you guys laughing at? "
"Frasier: Oh, nothing. "
"Martin: Oh, come on Don't leave your old man out. "
"Frasier: Well... all right, O.K. I was just explaining to Niles the reason why I drove all this way up here was to... I was hoping I'd hear you say the words, 'I love you.' "
"Martin: Oh, jeez, I leave you for two minutes and you have to start thinking. Isn't it enough that we're just here having a good time? "
"Niles: Dad... "
"Martin: You know, every year in this country thousands of guys go fishing, and love never enters into it "
"Frasier: Okay, okay, forget about it. "
"Martin: Thank you. Can we just go on fishing? "
"Frasier: Sure. "
"Niles: A fisherman in Oshkosh, Wisconsin stared into one of these holes for twenty years before he caught his first fish. "
"Frasier: Haven't we been here that long? "
"Martin: Anyway, just because I didn't say it doesn't mean I don't mean it or feel it. "
"Frasier: Dad, that's exactly what we were saying. "
"Niles: Absolutely. "
"Martin: Yeah, well, my dad never said it, but I know he felt it. I mean, feeling it's the same as saying it, isn't it? "
"Frasier: Dad, you don't have to say it. "
"Martin: Well, did it ever occur to you that... maybe I want to say it? You know, your mother used to get all over me about not saying stuff too. Well, I can't say it if you're looking at me "
"Niles: Would it help you if we left? "
"Martin: Just for that, I’m doing you second "
"Martin: I don’t know why it’s so hard. "
"Frasier: Dad, listen, you know you can say it. I mean, I heard you say it to Duke. "
"Martin: Oh, that’s different, I said, “I love ya” Ya "
"Frasier: We’d take “ya.” "
"Niles: Yeah. "
"Martin: Well, if I'm gonna do it, I'll do it right. Frasier... "
"Martin: Frasier... I love you. Niles... I love you. "
"Frasier: Thanks, Dad. I love you too. "
"Niles: And I love you too. "
"Niles: But I hate ice-fishing "
"Martin: Well, it's the last time you'll have to come out and do that. "
"Niles: Oh, in that case I REALLY love you "
"Martin: Well, thanks, Niles. "
"Niles: Oh, look at that, that's so cute. When you say it to him, he blushes I love you "
"Martin: Oh, no "
"Niles: I love you... "
"Martin: Oh, come on "
"Frasier: I love you... "
"Martin: No, cut that out... "
"Niles: Come on, give us a kiss "
"Martin: Oh, shut up "
"Ranger: Excuse me "
"Martin: Hey, officer "
"Niles: Oh, we're saved "
"Ranger: You guys are gonna have to come off the ice for the night. "
"Martin: Well, we can't, we lost the car keys. "
"Ranger: Then I'll take you to your motel, and you can call a locksmith in the morning. "
"Martin: Oh, thanks, officer "
"Frasier: That's a wonderful idea, you're quite a sport. "
"Niles: Yes Yes Thank you, we love you ' hand. "
"Niles: Ya We love ya "
"Martin: We've been drinking a little. "

"Frasier: You're on KACL with Dr. Frasier Crane. We have time for one more call. Hello, Gretchen. I'm listening. "
"Gretchen: Well, you see, Dr. Crane, my husband is a fencing instructor, and lately he spends all his time with his wealthy new student. He's with her day and night, and I'm afraid there's some... bumsen going on. "
"Frasier: Well, is this just a suspicion or do you have any evidence? "
"Gretchen: No, it's just a feeling. "
"Frasier: Well, unfortunately, in these matters there's no simple way to know for sure. "
"Roz: Yes, there is. "
"Frasier: Well, Gretchen, you're in luck. It just so happens that we have in our studio today one of the world's five leading bumsen experts. "
"Roz: If you want to know if a man is cheating, you offer him two choices for "
"dinner: one that's rich and fattening, and one that's light and sensible. If he picks the one that's calorie-packed, he doesn't mind turning into a bloated pig, which means he's happily married and you're in the clear. "
"Frasier: You know, Roz, when I hear advice like that, it makes me wish there was a law against two or more women gathering at a water cooler. Now, Gretchen— "
"Gretchen: Does it really work, Roz? "
"Roz: Oh, trust me. If he chooses the diet plate, it means he's staying in shape for his main squeeze, and you should get yourself a lawyer who can sue the sweat off a racehorse. "
"Gretchen: I'm going to do it. Thank you for your help, Roz Oh, and you, too, Dr. Crane. "
"Frasier: Don't mention it. Well, 'Dr. Crane and Friends' will be back tomorrow. Thanks for listening, Seattle. "
"Roz: I know, you hate it when I butt into your show. "
"Frasier: And yet... "
"Roz: You're gonna forgive me when you find out the wonderful thing I'm doing for you. See, there's this great woman who lives in my building. She's beautiful, and funny— "
"Frasier: Just stop right there, Roz. I do not go out on blind dates. They're demeaning and a hideous waste of time. No, thank you, no. "
"Roz: It's not for you, it's for your father. "
"Frasier: Oh What time should he pick her up? "
"Roz: Wait a minute. Blind dates are O.K. for your father, but not for you? "
"Frasier: Yes That also goes for games with balls, domestic beer, and giant trucks that roll over smaller ones. "
"Niles: “So you want to build a three-masted schooner. Step "
"One: before assembly, take inventory of all parts.” "
"Martin: We don't need to read all these instructions. "
"Niles: Yes, we do. It says right here in boldface, “Read all instructions.” "
"Martin: Just pass me the right side of the hull, will ya? "
"Niles: You'll get your hands on that piece at step sixteen and not a moment sooner. "
"Martin: Can we get started here? "
"Niles: Oh, all right, Dad. 'So you want to build a three- masted schooner.' "
"Niles: Give me that You'll put your eye out. "
"Daphne: Oh, look at that What a beautiful ship. I bet you'll have fun building that. "
"Martin: Not as much fun as we're having reading about it. "
"Daphne: Did I ever mention one of my ancestors was a mutineer on the H.M.S. Bounty? "
"Martin: No kidding. "
"Daphne: Yeah well, from what we could gather, he made it safely to Pitcairn Island, where he was quite fruitful and multiplied. You know, for all I know there's some girl who looks exactly like me running around the South Seas, frolicking in the surf, all brown-skinned and bare-breasted- "
"Niles: So you want to build a two-masted schooner. "
"Daphne: Schooner? I thought it was a frigate. "
"Niles: No, no, a frigate has a fore-and-aft mainsail. "
"Daphne: No, no, that's a brigantine. "
"Niles: Oh, you're right. Well, then what's a frigate? "
"Martin: That's when you just don't give a damn anymore. "
"Frasier: Hello, all. Niles, are you going to be spending the evening with us? "
"Niles: Yes. As much as my Maris misses me, she feels family comes first. When she saw this model, she felt it was the perfect project for me to share with Dad. "
"Frasier: She wanted you out of the house, huh? "
"Niles: Like a musty smell. "
"Frasier: Oh, Dad, I have a proposal for you. Seems there's a woman in Roz's building who would like to go out with you. Roz says that she's got a wonderful personality. "
"Martin: Oh. I guess that means I'm the pretty one. "
"Frasier: Just hear me out. She likes sports, she likes beer... "
"Martin: Yeah, so does Duke. "
"Frasier: Yes, but Duke won't kiss you good night at the end of the evening. "
"Martin: He will if he's had a few. Look, tell Roz thanks, but no thanks. "
"Daphne: Well, I think you're making a mistake. Trying new things is what keeps us all young and vibrant. "
"Niles: You know, you're right, Daphne. For weeks, all Maris did for excitement was float in her sensory deprivation tank. But now, she's taken up fencing, and I've never seen her more vital. She stays up late into the evening, working with her instructor. "
"Frasier: Maris has a fencing instructor? "
"Niles: Yes. Gunnar was the Bavarian champion three years running. "
"Frasier: He's Bavarian? "
"Niles: You're full of questions I've already given answers to. "
"Frasier: Am I? "
"Niles: He doesn't speak a word of English, so Maris gets to brush up on her German while she parries and thrusts. "
"Frasier: Maris is learning German, huh? Just when you thought she couldn't get any cuddlier. "
"Niles: Dad, did you take the spanking aft? "
"Martin: Yeah, I pre-glued it for you. "
"Niles: Good job. "
"Daphne: Oh, not to worry. This sort of thing used to happen to my brothers all the time. I can get that off with some nail- polish remover. Come with me. "
"Niles: So your brothers built a lot of models? "
"Daphne: No, actually, I suspect they just sniffed a lot of glue. "
"Niles: You know that can cause brain damage. "
"Daphne: Well, then, that confirms it. "
"Frasier: Dad Dad I have to talk to you about Niles. I got a call on the show today from a German woman whose husband is a fencing instructor who she suspects is having an affair with his wealthy new client. "
"Martin: And? "
"Frasier: Don't you find that the least bit incriminating? "
"Martin: No, I find it a coincidence. Seattle's a big city, I'm sure there's a bunch of German fencing instructors, each one with dozens of students. "
"Frasier: Yes, but are they wealthy students? "
"Martin: No, they're inner-city kids trying to work their way out of the ghetto with nothing but a foil and a dream. "
"Frasier: Yes, well, in the midst of that slag heap of sarcasm, I suppose there may be a kernel of truth. I guess I could just be letting my imagination run away with me. "
"Martin: Ah, just trust me, forget it. Come on, help me put this model together. "
"Frasier: God, I remember how Niles used to love these models. Oh God, remember that Christmas Mom got him the 'Visible Man and Woman?' He had to glue all of the internal organs in the right place. "
"Martin: All I remember is you two fighting over it. "
"Frasier: Yes, well, Niles was getting on my nerves, so I had to go in and steal his ovaries. "
"Daphne: Now there's a conversation I'm glad I missed the beginning of "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Sorry I'm late, Roz. "
"Roz: Oh, hey, Frasier. Did you get a chance to ask your dad about the date? "
"Frasier: Yes. He's not interested. "
"Roz: Oh, darn it. I already got her hopes up. I don't suppose you'd consider going out with her. "
"Frasier: I'm sorry. I've had my quota of pity-dates. "
"Roz: Yes, but this time you wouldn't be the one being pitied. "
"Roz: Oh, listen, we have a great call to start the show off with. Get "
"this: the guy on line three just found out that his girlfriend is his long-lost sister. "
"Frasier: Wow "
"Roz: Oh yeah, and that German woman called back about her husband's affair. "
"Frasier: Gretchen "
"Roz: Yeah. "
"Frasier: I want her first "
"Roz: Are you kidding? What am I supposed to say to the guy who's dating his sister? "
"Frasier: Oh, just tell him to hang on and relax, we've all been there "
"Frasier: Hello, Seattle, this is Dr. Frasier Crane on KACL. Let's get right to the phones. Roz? "
"Roz: We have Gretchen calling back about her husband's affair. She thinks she has more evidence. "
"Frasier: Hello, Gretchen. I'm listening. "
"Gretchen: Oh, Dr. Crane I took Roz's advice and gave my husband two choices for dinner, and he picked the diet plate "
"Frasier: But that is no proof that he's having an affair "
"Gretchen: But Gunnar has a healthy appetite "
"Frasier: No, no, the proof is-is phone bills, uh, credit card receipts... Gunnar? "
"Gretchen: I also found a love letter he wrote to her. "
"Frasier: And how long were you going to keep that a secret, Gretchen? Come on, work with me here What does it say? "
"Gretchen: “Mein kleine leberknodel...” "
"Frasier: I-I'm sorry, I don't speak German. "
"Gretchen: It means, 'my little liver dumpling.' That used to be his pet name for me. "
"Frasier: Well, maybe he's writing to you. "
"Gretchen: It can't be me. He says he loves her beautiful little body, as thin as his sword, and her skin as white as bratwurst, and that she's his NichteinmenschlichFrau. "
"Frasier: What is that? "
"Gretchen: I don't know if there's a word in English. The closest translation is, 'not quite human woman.' "
"Frasier: Oh dear God, it is her "
"Gretchen: What should I do? "
"Frasier: I don't know I-I need time to think Let's go to commercial "
"Frasier: Hello, we're back. Gretchen, I have considered your problem, and I believe that what you must do is confront your husband, and insist that he end this affair. "
"Gretchen: But what if he won't? "
"Frasier: But he has to Look, innocent people are being hurt Remind him of how much he means to you, of all your years together. Are there children? "
"Gretchen: No. "
"Frasier: Damn Still, still, it must be a clean break, he must never, ever see this woman again, not even accidentally "
"Gretchen: We never had these problems back home. "
"Frasier: Well, maybe that's where you should return, to the loving bosom of Bavaria. "
"Gretchen: How did you know we were from Bavaria? "
"Frasier: Well... you see, I'm a master of dialects. I noticed there was a glottal quality to the occlusion of your diphthongs. "
"Gretchen: But I'm originally from Austria. "
"Frasier: Look, do you want to split hairs, or do you want your husband back? Uh, Gretchen, I'm afraid it's time for another commercial. "
"Roz: Another commercial? "
"Frasier: Yes, Roz, another commercial "
"Roz: What is going on? "
"Frasier: What makes you think there's something going on? "
"Roz: Well, when the person giving advice sounds crazier than the person calling in, I think there's something going on. "
"Frasier: Nothing's going on. "
"Roz: Wait a minute. You know who the liver dumpling is, don't you? "
"Frasier: All right, yes But it's nobody you know. Her husband's a good friend of mine. Oh, how can I tell him, he'll be crushed. "
"Roz: Well, you don't tell the person being cheated on, you confront the person doing the cheating. Didn't they teach you anything at Harvard? "
"Frasier: I-I can't do that "
"Roz: It's easy, Frasier. You just tell her you know she's been mattress-surfing with some other guy, and if she doesn't knock it off, you'll tell her husband. "
"Frasier: It's-it's not that easy, you don't know this woman She doesn't deal with confrontation very well. I once questioned the political correctness of her serving veal. An hour later, we found her locked in the garage with the engine running on her golf cart "
"Roz: Whoa, it's Maris. "
"TO: "
"Marta: Missy Crane esta en la caja. "
"Frasier: 'Mrs. Crane is in the box.' "
"Marta: En la caja. "
"Frasier: Maris? This is Frasier. I am tired of waiting for you to come out of this ridiculous deprivation tank. Now, listen. We've got to talk, we've got to talk about Niles. "
"Frasier: Will you come out of there Look, Maris... I know that you're having an affair. But I care for you both, and I want to help you do what's best for your marriage. "
"Frasier: Oh, will you stop this Just come out of this box All right, all right I'm going to open this door I'm going to count to three and I don't care if you're naked I'm going to count to ten Oh, the hell with this All right "
"Frasier: Niles... I'm so sorry. Marta, you said Mrs. Crane was in the box "
"Marta: Si, Missy Crane. "
"Frasier: No, that's MISTER Crane "
"Niles: Marta has trouble with her pronouns. "
"TO: "
"Martin: I'm worried about him. He's always been such a sensitive kid. "
"Frasier: You're right, Dad, and you know what? Maybe it's wise for us not to let on how worried we are. It'll only add to his anxiety. "
"Martin: Yeah, you're right. If we coddle him, he'll think this is the end of the world. "
"Frasier: Hello, Niles "
"Martin: Hi, son "
"Martin: Frasier, pour him a glass of brandy. "
"Frasier: Yes, yes, yes. Oh God, you know, I'm all out of brandy. I have a marvelous sherry here, a couple of fine ports... oh, and this lovely new bottle of twelve-year-old unblended scotch. It's a little bit peaty— "
"Martin: Just pour him a drink What happened, son? "
"Niles: Oh, nothing. "
"Frasier: Nothing? Well, when I left, you were about to storm up to Maris's bedroom and have it out with her. "
"Niles: I know. And with every step I thought of another question to fire at her, but when I reached her door, I froze. I turned on my heel, walked out of the house, got in the car and just started driving. "
"Frasier: Well, I'm glad you ended up here. [hands him a glass of Scotch with a lemon wedge] "
"Niles: Actually, I ended up at the Oregon border check. I had fruit in the car, so I had to turn back. What am I going to do? She's my whole life. "
"Frasier: You know, Niles, Maris may have temporarily succumbed to Gunnar's Teutonic charms, but in the end I'm sure she'll choose the man who's intelligent and sensitive. "
"Niles: Oh, Frasier. That's just something we used to tell ourselves in chess club. The truth is, women don't want men like us — men of intellect. They want men of action — men like Gunnar. "
"Frasier: Yes, well, you know this has nothing to do with Gunnar and everything to do with you and Maris. Do you remember the advice you gave me when I was having my problems with Lilith? You said that I should talk to her and find out why she did what she did. "
"Niles: It's one thing to give advice, it's another to take it. "
"Martin: Hey, hey, Fras, didn't you and Lilith once write a bunch of articles together about the keys to a successful marriage? "
"Frasier: Yes, we did. "
"Martin: Well, maybe it'd help your brother to read 'em right now. "
"Frasier: Oh. Oh, well, all right. I've only got half of them, though. Lilith got the rest in the divorce settlement. "
"Martin: Now, listen, now that we've gotten rid of the foghorn, here's the way you're gonna handle this. Now, you remember something like this happened between your mother and I, right? "
"Niles: Right. "
"Martin: Right. Well, the way I handled it was I took it up with the other man. I told him if it ever happened again, he'd be the other woman Now there was a lot more that we had to do to keep our marriage together, but at least that let your mother know how much I cared for her. "
"Niles: What would you have me do? Grab Gunnar by the scruff of the neck and escort him out of my house? "
"Martin: Well, why not? "
"Niles: Well, I've been fantasizing about it It's just not me, though... although, maybe it should be me No, no, I've got to speak to Maris eventually... although, if I do it your way, I'm going at it from a position of strength. I'm gonna do it, Dad Maris has fencing practice tonight, but it's Gunnar who's going to be taught a lesson "
"Martin: That's my boy You're sure you're up to it? "
"Niles: Yes, I am I'm pumped, I'm psyched, and I'm fairly certain I just swallowed an entire twist of lemon "
"Frasier: Did I just hear Niles leave? "
"Martin: Yeah, he went to straighten out that Gunnar guy "
"Frasier: My God, Dad, how could you let him go? What if this Gunnar guy doesn't want to get straightened out? What if he wants to fight? "
"Martin: Well, that's all right, it's still better this way At least he's found his manhood. "
"Martin: I tell ya, I'd be happy if Niles traded in a couple of teeth for his cojones "
"Daphne: I've got to stop walking in on the middle of conversations "
"TO: "
"Niles: There you are Yes, I'm talking to you, strudel boy No one seduces my wife and gets away with it You probably thought because of my refined bearing and swimmer's build that I wouldn't put up a fight for the woman I love. But you're dead wrong, because real men have a thing called “honor” [Gunnar stands up; he's a full head taller than Niles] Yow You wouldn't know about that, would you? "
"Frasier: Niles... "
"Niles: You wouldn't know how decent people behave. "
"Frasier: Niles... "
"Niles: You wouldn't know the meaning of the word 'rectitude' "
"Frasier: Niles, he wouldn't know the meaning of the word 'dog,' 'cat,' or 'pencil' He doesn't speak English, remember? "
"Gunnar: Wieso ist er so bose? "
"Marta: Ich weiss nicht. "
"Niles: Marta You speak German? "
"Marta: Que? "
"Frasier: Uh, habla alleman? "
"Marta: Si Yo trabajo para una familia allemana que llego a Guatemala despues a la Guerra. "
"Frasier: Apparently she worked for a German family that turned up in Guatemala... just after the war. "
"Niles: Well, well, good, good She can translate for me Tell her to tell him— "
"Frasier: Niles, Niles, just wait "
"Niles: What? "
"Frasier: Look at him God, if he knew you were calling him 'strudel boy,' he'd be wiping his feet on your face "
"Niles: Hang that, Frasier If there're going to be scuffs, they'll be scuffs of honor. How dare you steal my wife Translate "
"Frasier: Oh, all right. Senor Crane quiere que preguntas a Gunnar, uh, 'Como se atrevez a robar mis zapatos' "
"Marta: Was fallt Dir ein meine Schuhe zu stehlen? "
"Gunnar: Schweinehund "
"Niles: All right, fine, you want to challenge me? [throws off his jacket and grabs the other sword] En garde "
"Frasier: Oh yes, Niles, that's just what we need, a fourth language Niles, you can't possibly fight this man "
"Niles: Are you forgetting? I've been fencing since prep school "
"Frasier: Yes, oh, so what? The man was obviously born with a sword in his hand He probably performed his own Caesarean "
"Niles: Oh my God, he's gonna kill me. "
"Niles: Farvegnugen "
"Gunnar: Farvegnugen? "
"Gunnar: "
"Niles: Oh, very nice, very nice, thank you ' grin. "
"Frasier: Niles Niles Niles, my God, are you all right? "
"Gunnar: Entschuldige Dich sofort Ich habe nicht Deine Schuhe gestohlen "
"Niles: Is he giving up? "
"Marta: Piedme perdon Yo no te robo sus zapatos "
"Frasier: He says he wants you to apologize. He didn't steal... your shoes. "
"Niles: My shoes? "
"Frasier: Yes, I'm sorry. Apparently I mistranslated. Look, he didn't mean, uh... not shoes, wife No zapatos, esposa "
"Marta: Nicht Schuhe, Frau "
"Gunnar: Frau? "
"Gunnar: Maris ist unwiderstehlich. "
"Marta: No me puede contralar. Maris est irresistible. "
"Frasier: He couldn't help himself, Maris is irresistible. Irresistible? "
"Marta: Unwiderstehlich? "
"Gunnar: Ja. "
"Marta: Si. "
"Frasier: O-kayy. "
"Gunnar: Aber sie hat mich abgewiesen. "
"Marta: Pero me rechazo. "
"Frasier: Oh, but she refused him. "
"Niles: Really? "
"Frasier: Verdad? "
"Marta: Wirklich? "
"Niles: Well, what did Maris say? "
"Frasier: Que decia? "
"Marta: Was hat sie gesagt? "
"Gunnar: 'Ich liebe Niles.' "
"Marta: 'Yo amo Niles.' "
"Frasier: 'I love Niles.' "
"Niles: She loves me My marriage is whole "
"Niles: Give me five seconds, then tell him he's fired. [running upstairs] Maris "
"Frasier: Oh lord, if only I can do something to help Gunnar and Gretchen. "
"Gunnar: Gretchen? "
"Frasier: Ja, ja, uh... Tell him that his wife loves him very much. Uh, I mean, diga a Gunnar que su esposa le ama mucho. "
"Marta: Diem Frau liebt ihn sehr. "
"Gunnar: SCHWEINEHUND "
"Frasier: No, no, not me You, you Marta, damn your pronoun problems "
"Frasier: All right, then, you hapless wretch "

"Niles: Hello, Frasier. "
"Frasier: Oh, Niles "
"Niles: Double latte, full fat, chocolate shavings. "
"Frasier: Ah, the self-pity special. "
"Niles: I've had a hellish week. To top it all off, old Reggie Belknap, the president of our wine club, kicked the bucket. The man's body was not even properly chilled before the club jackals began angling to succeed him. You've never seen such vicious, cutthroat conniving "
"Frasier: Who's winning? "
"Niles: Well, Maris, of course, but just barely. Matthew Pym tried to stage a coup Fortunately, Maris has photos she took at his wedding — photos that clearly show the label on the champagne he served. "
"Frasier: Domestic? "
"Niles: Oh-ho-ho-ho, not just domestic. From... Connecticut. "
"Niles: Oh dear, don't turn around. It's that dreadful woman who works for you. "
"Frasier: Who? "
"Niles: Um, uh... Lady MacBeth without the sincerity? "
"Frasier: Oh Oh, Bebe's here Oh, yes. [stands and pulls up another chair] Now, listen Niles, I care for her just as little as you do, but she is a terrific agent, which is why I overlook the fact that she's pushy and obnoxious and the most appalling phony I've ever known. Bebe, darling, how are you "
"Bebe: My poor wounded baby I just heard what those misers you work for are trying to do to you Well, don't you worry, they're not going to get away with it "
"Frasier: Well, you must have heard wrong, Bebe. They extended my contract for another year with an eight-percent raise. "
"Bebe: Eight percent? That would insult even a waiter [to a passing waiter] Double cappuccino — move it "
"Frasier: Well, Bebe, that is what my contract calls for. "
"Bebe: A slave contract you negotiated two years ago before you even had an agent They took advantage of your inexperience. "
"Frasier: I thought it was a very generous offer. "
"Bebe: Oh please, do you have any idea how hot you are? I get offers every day from other stations, offering the moon for you "
"Frasier: Good lord, am I really that hot? "
"Bebe: Are you kidding? If I were a pot roast... I'd be done. "
"Niles: Hello, I'm Niles, a person at the table. "
"Bebe: Niles, thank God you're here Back me up, give him some sound brotherly advice. "
"Niles: She's the Devil, Frasier. Run fast, run far. "
"Frasier: Listen Bebe, I realize that the station is making a handsome profit on my show, but what can I do? I do have a contract. "
"Bebe: No, darling, what you have is a... fever. "
"Frasier: What? "
"Bebe: Ooh, you're like a furnace "
"Frasier: Well, you know, I-I think I see where you're going with this, Bebe, and I’m not sure how I feel about it. "
"Bebe: Well, how do you feel about being one of the lowest paid personalities at the station? "
"Frasier: Who makes more? "
"Bebe: Who doesn't? Nanette from 'Pet Chat,' The Happy Chef — oh, for heaven's sakes, Father Mike could buy and sell you "
"Frasier: Father Mike? He took a vow of poverty "
"Bebe: Well, now he's taking a cruise. "
"Bebe: Oh, that big strapping chest of yours is all congested. You just say the word, and I’ll tell the station you have some coughing up to do... and so do they. "
"Frasier: Bebe, this fever of mine... how much higher do you think it might go? "
"Bebe: I'm guessing... thirty to forty percent above where it is now. "
"Niles: Forty percent? "
"Frasier: Well, what can I say but, uh... Ah-choo "
"Frasier: No, thank you. "
"TV: "
"Man: Child, you wanted me to make you pregnant "
"Woman: I was in a coma, you might have waited. "
"Frasier: My God, let's see, they've got Sky, Zena, and Slate. "
"Daphne: I don't think someone called Frasier should be pointing any fingers. "
"Frasier: Is this how you spend your days when I'm not at home? "
"Daphne: Not quite. When you're not home I can bloody well hear what they're saying. "
"Frasier: Oh, you wouldn't want to miss a line of this dialogue. 'Oh, Zirconia, can't you see Stone doesn't love you? He loves Placenta' "
"Martin: My favorite are the villains. They have one guy on here who kicked his grandmother down the stairs, embezzled money from a children's hospital, and poisoned a puppy. "
"Martin: Give him credit, though, he did show up for work every day. "
"Frasier: Oh dear, Dad, if you're going to be so devilishly subtle, how will I ever get your point? "
"Martin: All right, well, call me old-fashioned. I think that when you sign a contract, you stick to it. A man's only as good as his word. "
"Frasier: Yes, well, my words have doubled the station's ad revenues All they’ve shown me for thanks is a measly eight-percent raise "
"Martin: Oh, so what? In thirty years on the police force, you think I ever went to the sergeant and said, 'Hey, I'm shooting way more bad guys than I thought I would, how about a bonus?' "
"Frasier: Dad, you don't understand, this is show business— "
"Daphne: I'll get it. "
"Frasier: Thank you, Daphne. You see, we do things differently. Negotiations are like a, are like a dance. They expect me to fight my contract. They know I'm not sick. I know they know I'm not sick. They know I know they know I'm not sick. It's all part of the negotiations mambo. "
"Daphne: Hello, Roz. "
"Roz: Hi, Daphne. "
"Martin: Hi, Roz. "
"Roz: Hey, Martin. "
"Frasier: Roz, how goes things at the front? "
"Roz: Well, for starters, they’ve painted over your name on your parking space. "
"Frasier: Perfect "
"Daphne: What? "
"Frasier: No, Bebe told me they might do that. It's part of a negotiation tactic, it shows that they're getting nervous. "
"Roz: Well, they must be really jittery then, because they took your picture out of the lobby. "
"Frasier: Roz, Roz, they're just trying to scare me. "
"Martin: And he knows they're trying to scare him, and they know that he knows they're trying to scare him, he knows that they know that he knows— "
"Frasier: Thank you, Dad They're just bluffing, it's like a card game. "
"Martin: Like a card game, it's like a dance — the whole thing sounds like a weekend in Vegas. "
"Roz: You know, I would have thought they'd play games too, Frasier. But they started auditioning people to replace you. "
"Frasier: They're interviewing people? "
"Roz: All day. And they're really hot on this woman who has some gardening show. She calls herself 'Ma Nature.' I can’t work for her, Frasier, you should see her nails. "
"Frasier: Well, there's no need to panic, Roz. I'm sure it's all part of the dance. "
"Mike: Hi, Dr. Crane. The station sent me over with your stuff. Sorry. "
"Frasier: Oh my God, they've cleaned out my cubicle? Listen, Mike, you're up on all the gossip — I mean, they're just bluffing, right? "
"Mike: I hope not. My audition went really well. "
"Bebe: Nurse Bebe reporting for duty Blossoms for my little shut- in Put these in something. "
"Frasier: Oh, Bebe, Bebe, have you heard what’s going on? They've cleaned out my cubicle, they're auditioning other people— "
"Bebe: Marvelous They're resorting to cheap scare tactics Looks like I was right to bring this along. [takes a bottle of champagne from her purse and holds it out to Daphne] Chill that. "
"Bebe: Darling, you're looking a little pale. Don't tell me these amateur theatrics are actually worrying you? "
"Frasier: Well, no, no, but the stress of not worrying is starting to get to me. I don't know if I can take much more of this "
"Bebe: Oh darling, if that's the way you feel, then fine Let's get this over with "
"Roz: Oh Frasier, it's for the best. Really, trust me on this one. "
"Bebe: Tom Duran, please. Bebe Glaser calling. [winks at Frasier] Tom? Bebe's bored You've huffed, and you've puffed, but our house is still standing We're giving you a midnight deadline Either call us here at Frasier's and tell us you'll renegotiate, or we'll walk Love ya. "
"Bebe: There. That should make them sweat, don't you think? "
"Frasier: It might "
"Bebe: Well, it's all over but the waiting. Canasta, anyone? [takes a pack of cards from her purse and hands them to Daphne] Shuffle these. "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Eleven forty-five. Oh, God. It’s over. They’ve made the decision, it’s over. Well, it was a fun run while it lasted, eh, Seattle? This is Dr. Frasier Crane And I was listening "
"Daphne: Here we are One cup of tea — half Darjeeling, half Chamomile, skim milk, a packet of sweetener — oh, and I thought you might enjoy a nice fat-free tea biscuit. Will there be anything else? "
"Bebe: No. You run along, I'm fine. "
"Daphne: You're sure now? Because I could wait until you finish the biscuit and floss your teeth for you. "
"Bebe: You are a cheeky little monkey, aren't you? [bites the tea biscuit] This cookie tastes like meat "
"Daphne: Yes, and it'll remove tartar, and give you a nice, shiny coat. "
"Martin: Well, I think I'm gonna hit the hay too. "
"Bebe: That's awfully risky of you, isn't it? Leaving us kids out here un-chaperoned? "
"Martin: Better him than me. "
"Bebe: Why are you so tense? This is the best part What could be more fun than this? "
"Frasier: Oh, watching a loved one be autopsied? "
"Bebe: Think of them sweating in their offices — chain-smoking, biting their nails, their ulcers churning out enough acid to burn a hole in a ship's hull Ooh, God And to think I nearly went into nursing. "
"Frasier: Oh, you're right, Bebe, you're right My God, if they're foolish enough to let me go, well then, fine There are any number of other stations that would love to have Frasier Crane on board "
"Bebe: Exactly "
"Frasier: Yes. But you know, in fact, I think it's time maybe we discussed those other offers, consider what our fallback position should be. "
"Bebe: Ooh, someone's out of Scotch "
"Frasier: Bebe... tell me there are other offers. "
"Bebe: Scads "
"Frasier: Now you look me in the eye and tell me the truth "
"Bebe: There are no other offers. Straight up, or on the rocks? "
"Frasier: Oh my God "
"Bebe: Darling, you can't make a deal without bluffing a little "
"Frasier: You're supposed to bluff them, not me My God, woman, are you trying to ruin me? "
"Bebe: You are such a worrywart "
"Frasier: Now don't you patronize me, you sweet-talking succubus You get on the phone and call them "
"Bebe: Ooh my God, Hands of Hercules What must your legs be like? "
"Frasier: Answer it. "
"Bebe: Not yet. Where are we? Have we gone out? Is it too late? "
"Frasier: ANSWER IT "
"Bebe: It's them. I see. I see. Fine. "
"Frasier: Well? "
"Bebe: Renegotiations tomorrow, starting from scratch "
"Frasier: Oh Oh, dear God Oh, we did it Oh my God, I'm so pleased. Thank you, Bebe. "
"Bebe: Maybe next time you'll trust little Bebe. "
"Frasier: Yes, oh, I’m so sorry, you're right, I underestimated you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for that horrible outburst and for grabbing you the way I did. "
"Bebe: Don't be. I was impressed. It was manly in a... hysterical sort of way. "
"Bebe: Cheers. "
"Frasier: Champagne, on top of scotch? Oh, what the hell. "
"Bebe: To a beautiful partnership. "
"Frasier: No, no — to a remarkable agent. What Bebe wants, Bebe gets. When will I ever learn that? "
"Bebe: Soon enough, dear. "
"Bebe: Soon enough. "
"Martin: Sorry, Eddie, he's still alive. You're not gonna get your own room after all. "
"Frasier: Oh God... "
"Martin: How're you feeling? "
"Frasier: How do I look? "
"Martin: Last time I saw a guy who looked like you, he'd been in the trunk of a car at the airport for a month. "
"Daphne: Good morning My goodness Christened a few ships last night, I see. "
"Frasier: The station agreed to renegotiate. "
"Martin: Oh, all right "
"Daphne: Oh, marvelous "
"Frasier: Yes, they called around five to midnight... and Bebe and I had some champagne to celebrate, and then... and then... Oh, God. "
"Bebe: Morning, Doctor. "
"Frasier: Somebody hold me. "
"Bebe: I hope you don't mind, but I didn't see a robe, and your shirt looked so nice and big and warm — just like you. "
"Martin: Well, I think I’ll go in the other room and eat my breakfast — while I still can "
"Daphne: I'd better go cook for him. I know how the Crane men like their legs. — eggs "
"Bebe: I think they're a little shocked "
"Frasier: Well, I'm, I’m a little surprised myself. "
"Bebe: Oh, let's not kid ourselves. We both knew this would happen someday. "
"Frasier: We did? "
"Bebe: The signs were all there — the glances, the furtive smiles... "
"Frasier: Uh, you know what would really hit the spot right now? "
"Bebe: My God, you're a machine "
"Frasier: Coffee I meant coffee. "
"Bebe: I'll get it. "
"Frasier: Oh no no no, that's not necessary— "
"Bebe: Good morning, Niles What a lovely surprise We were just about to sit down to a big family breakfast. Won't you join us? "
"Frasier: Come on in, Niles, it's all right. "
"Frasier: We were celebrating. You see, the station called to renegotiate my contract. "
"Niles: Ah. Paid your commission up-front, I see. "
"Bebe: It's getting late, I'd better go freshen up. Save me a muffin, Muffin "
"Frasier: Oh, all right, just go ahead, get your shots in "
"Niles: No, no. I'm just glad your all right. I would have assumed she killed after mating. "
"Martin: Is she gone? "
"Frasier: No, Dad, she’s—she's changing. Oh my God, how did this happen? "
"Niles: You're asking us? "
"Frasier: Oh, I've got to talk with her, I've got to tell her this was all just a mistake. "
"Daphne: Well, you'd better be careful how you let her down. She's liable to go nuts — like in that movie — then sneak in here and try to boil Eddie "
"Martin: Well, look, we'll clear out of here and give you a little privacy. "
"Frasier: No, no, no, Dad, I can't tell her right now. She's about to go down there and renegotiate my contract. I'll tell her later. "
"Martin: Oh, that's a good idea — wait till she makes you a bunch of money, then on top of breaking her heart you can make her feel really used. "
"Daphne: Sounds like a plan to me. "
"Bebe: Darling "
"Niles: We'll leave you to your happy task. "
"Bebe: Cancel that muffin. Bebe just started a diet — Wink Besides, tonight we're dining at Bernardi's. It's sinfully expensive, but I think after contract talks we can afford it "
"Frasier: Uh, Bebe— "
"Bebe: Yeeeeessss? "
"Frasier: Bebe, um, I don't think there are any words to describe what we shared last night... "
"Bebe: It was like... Greco-Roman wrestling on a trampoline. "
"Frasier: You see, I- as magical as it was, I –I don't think it's the kind of thing we should let happen again. "
"Bebe: Ooh "
"Frasier: Well, you see, I value you too much as a colleague to do anything that might jeopardize that relationship. "
"Bebe: I see. "
"Frasier: Oh, you're upset. "
"Bebe: No, I'm sure we both would have realized it was a mistake sooner or later. Personally, I was hoping for later but I suppose sooner’s is best. "
"Frasier: It is, it really is. "
"Bebe: I'd better dash, I'll call you after the meeting. "
"Frasier: Oh, like you never crawled under the wrong fence once in your life "
"TO: "
"Niles: Disaster again. Maris’s little wine club had an outing at a local vineyard. As the new president, she had the honor of being first into the stomping vat. You can imagine her humiliation when she danced herself into a barefoot fury and was unable to break even a single grape. "
"Niles: Frasier, have you heard a word I've said? "
"Frasier: Of course not, Niles. I'm still worried about Bebe. "
"Niles: I thought you said she took it well. "
"Frasier: Well, she did, but you know how it is with strong women. Sometimes their strength masks their vulnerability. Well, let's face it. Once a woman has dipped her toe into Crane Lake, dry land is never the same again. "
"Niles: Yes, she's probably home in her room writing 'Mrs. Bebe Crane' over and over in the margin of her algebra book. "
"Frasier: You can make light of this if you want to, but it is entirely possible that I broke that woman's heart "
"Roz: Who? Whose heart did you break? "
"Frasier: No one Niles, be quiet "
"Roz: Oh, come on, Frasier I'm gonna figure it out sooner or later. Come on, give me a clue, just one, that's all I need. "
"Bulldog: Doc Doc Come quick Bebe's out on the ledge of our building, she's threatening to jump "
"Frasier: Oh my God This is all my fault "
"Roz: Wait Just give me a hint "
"TO: "
"Tom: Bebe, please... "
"Bebe: Get away from me "
"Frasier: What happened? "
"Tom: I don't know. We were working on your deal, and she just burst into tears. I went out to get some water for her. When I came back, she's standing out there, sobbing that she doesn't want to live "
"Frasier: Bebe, it's Frasier. Please come in. "
"Bebe: It's no good My life is over "
"Bulldog: You got to save her, Doc. My contract's up in six weeks, she's my agent too. "
"Frasier: All right, I'm going out there. "
"Roz: Are you nuts? That's nine stories down You know what a drop like that would do to you? "
"Frasier: No, Roz, why don't you toss a pumpkin out the window so I have a clear image just before I try? "
"Tom: Why don't we just wait for the police? "
"Frasier: No, no No, that woman out there needs me. Bebe, I'm coming out. "
"Bebe: Don't come any closer I'll jump "
"Frasier: Bebe, please— "
"Bebe: No, you can't help me No one can help me "
"Frasier: I'm not worth doing this over. Look, there'll be other men. It may take time, but you'll get over me. "
"Bebe: Well, somebody certainly thinks well of himself. "
"Frasier: What? "
"Bebe: Darling, this isn't about us It's just a little bargaining tactic. "
"Bebe: I threaten to jump, you talk me down, major coverage — bang, your price goes up twenty percent My life is meaningless Talk to me, darling, talk to me "
"Frasier: Are you out of your mind? Now listen, you're coming in, you're coming in right now "
"Bebe: Get away from me You can't talk me out of this At least not until Channel Five gets here. Now come on, dear, make like a therapist "
"Frasier: God, you are out of your mind You-you need help, you should be in therapy "
"Bebe: That's good, but louder. Give me one reason to live Just one ' "
"Frasier: There are... hundreds of reasons Work Art The people who care about you Now come in, you crazy bitch "
"Bebe: Channel Five, come to Mama Okay, dear. Full coverage — now here's the "
"plan: I swoon forward, you reach out and catch me. "
"Frasier: What? "
"Bebe: On three. One, two... "
"Frasier: No "
"Bebe: THREE "
"Bebe: Film at eleven. "
"Frasier: Oh, God... Oh God... just get in. "
"Roz: Oh, Bebe, are you all right? "
"Bebe: Yes... I'm fine now. "
"Roz: Bulldog, get her some water. You want to sit down? "
"Bebe: Thank you, Frasier. You saved my life. "
"Tom: That was incredible, Frasier. Look, uh, I know we've got some unfinished business. But, rest assured, after this, there's no way we're gonna let you get away. "
"Frasier: Well... thank you, Tom. If I could just have a moment alone with Bebe? "
"Roz: Sure. "
"Frasier: What kind of a woman are you? You seduced me, you lied to me, you nearly got me killed You've shamelessly manipulated not only me, but this station, the news media, and the entire city of Seattle What do you have to say for yourself? "
"Bebe: Aren't you glad I'm on your side? "
"Frasier: Yes, I... suppose I am. "

"Gil: And so, in the opinion of this critic, Mickey's Good Time Tavern is anything but. Dismal decor, perfunctory service, and cuisine which is only marginally preferable to hunger. And finally, on a sadder note, after fifty-three years in the same location, Orsini's is closing its doors. And so tonight, a sad adieu to the grande dame of Seattle restaurants. "
"Roz: I thought HE was the grande dame of Seattle restaurants. "
"Gil: Until next time, this is Gil Chesterton saying bon appetite, buon appatito and nifty noshing. "
"Roz: Gil, why is Orsini's closing? "
"Gil: Well, the owner's getting old, he wants to sell. And just between us, I'm afraid Orsini's a bit like wine that's stayed too long in the cellar. It retains only memories of its former glory. "
"Frasier: Not comping your check anymore? "
"Gil: Not for months now. "
"Frasier: You know, Orsini's used to be my favorite restaurant. You ever been there, Roz? "
"Roz: Are you kidding? My typical date's idea of a gourmet evening is take out, make out, and home by Letterman. "
"Niles: Knock knock "
"Frasier: Hello, Niles. It's not really a good time for a visit, show starts in two minutes. "
"Niles: Just enough time to show you the John Steinbeck first edition I bought at the rare book fair. [takes the book out of the bag and shows him] “Saint Katy the Virgin” in like-new condition. "
"Frasier: Yes, well, she'd have to be, wouldn't she? "
"Niles: It’s quite a charming book, really. It's a shame more people haven't read it. "
"Roz: Oh, let's see. "
"Niles: Don't touch The smallest smudge decreases its value. "
"Frasier: Oh, Niles, guess what thriving Seattle night spot is closing its doors. "
"Niles: Roz, you're moving. "
"Frasier: No, Niles. Orsini's is closing. "
"Niles: Oh, it can't be. It's part of Crane history. Grandfather took me there for my eighth birthday. "
"Frasier: Thank you, Roz. "
"Niles: Childhood memories, so vivid. Wearing paper hats, singing Happy Birthday, sending back the Veal Prince Orlov. "
"Roz: Thirty seconds, Frasier. "
"Frasier: Thank you, Roz. Niles, tonight let's go to Orsini's for one glorious farewell dinner. "
"Niles: Why not? I'll make the reservations. We'll take Dad and Daphne. "
"Frasier: Great. Will Maris be joining us? "
"Niles: Ohhh... sadly, no. She had a bad experience there one Christmas Eve. An Italian soccer team was sitting at the next table, Maris announced she was in the mood for a goose, and - perhaps inevitably - tragedy ensued. "
"Frasier: What has happened to this place? "
"Niles: I know. It's like running into a movie star you worshipped as a child, only time has left her hair brittle, her eyes sunken and dull, her skin waxy and sallow... "
"Martin: Well, I got quite an appetite. How 'bout you, Daph? "
": Yes, sir. Do you have a reservation? "
"Frasier: Yes, the name is Crane, for four. "
": Ah, table nine seems to be free. Right this way sir, your waiter will be with you in a moment. "
"Frasier: Thank you. Over here, Daph. "
"Daphne: Oh, thank you. "
"Niles: Dad, Frasier, isn't that Otto? "
"Frasier: Oh my God, I believe it is. You know, Otto is legendary here. He's been with them forever, he never writes a single thing down, he keeps it all in his head. Otto "
"Otto: Oh, coming up. Your check, sir. "
"Frasier: No, no. Wrong table. We would like menus, please. "
"Otto: Sorry. I hate it when we get crowded. "
"Martin: I'm goin' to the john. Order me a beer. "
"Frasier: Oh gee, Dad, for a moment there, I thought you were going to surprise me and order a glass of wine. "
"Martin: Oh yeah, for a moment there I thought you were gonna surprise me and button your yap. "
"Frasier: I'd order him the crab cocktail, but I'm afraid the irony would be lost on him. "
"Niles: The owner's going to have his hands full trying to find a buyer for this place. "
"Frasier: Yes, alas. I'm afraid we've found one old relic who's time has come to be put out of his misery. [Otto has come back and looks worried at this.] Oh no, Otto, I didn't mean you. "
"Otto: Your menus, sir. "
"Niles: It's all right. He's in the men's room. "
"Frasier: No, no, leave it here. "
"Daphne: Why are Americans always in such an almighty rush to tear things down? At home, we treasure our antiquities but you people just can't wait to bring in the bulldozers. "
"Niles: You know, I'm inclined to agree with Daphne. "
"Frasier: I'll try to contain my amazement. "
"Daphne: It would be a crime to lose a landmark like this. I mean, look at it. It's well built, good structure. "
"Niles: It does have good bones. It's in a very good location. "
"Frasier: Excellent location. If they only had valet parking... "
"Niles: If they just took down those awful curtains... "
"Frasier: Knocked out these pillars... "
"Frasier: You know, I've always dreamed of owning a four-star restaurant. "
"Niles: What growing boy hasn't? "
"Frasier: Of course, we'd need a new chef. "
"Niles: I happen to know the chef at Emilio's is very unhappy. "
"Frasier: Of course, everyone knows that. The man's scongili is a cry for help. "
"Niles: Frasier, are you thinking what I'm thinking? "
"Frasier: I'm picking out china and sandblasting the wine cave "
"Daphne: Owning a restaurant is hard work. If you don't scald yourself or lop off a finger with a cleaver, you spend your whole time gagging at grease fires, killing rats and brawling with labor racketeers. My auntie had a little tea room. "
"Martin: Wait a minute Don't tell me you two are seriously considering doing a dumb-ass, idiotic thing like buying this place? "
"Frasier: With all due respect, Dad, we are not exactly neophytes in this field. We know food, we know wine... "
"Niles: Lord knows we have style, taste and refinement... "
"Martin: You see, that's what always gets you guys in trouble. You don't think about the hard work or the long hours. No, to you, owning a restaurant is just wearing fancy clothes, hobnobbing with your friends and turning your enemies away at the door. "
"Niles: I hadn't even thought about that "
"Martin: Look, when I was a cop walkin' the beat, there was this one restaurant on the corner. In ten years, it must have changed hands twenty times. First it was Ling Fun's Lichi Palace, then it was Tony's Meatball Hutch, then it was A Little Taste of Yorkshire - English food. Huh, big surprise, that lasted about five minutes. "
"Niles: You know, Frasier, Dad has a point. A lot of people have lost a lot of money in this business for one "
"reason: they picked the wrong name. "
"Frasier: True, Niles, but I've got something very special. I was thinking about this while Dad was talking. "
"Frasier: “Maison Crane.” Oh, God, you're right, it's a little too obvious. "
"Niles: We want our name to be inviting and welcoming. Oh, oh, what's the word for “lighthearted” in French? "
"Frasier: There isn't one. I've got it, Niles, I've got it Le Freres Heureux. "
"Niles: “The Happy Brothers”... Brilliant It's homey, but just hard enough to pronounce to intimidate the riff-raff "
"Frasier: Yes We'll make the place very, very exclusive No sign on the outside, no advertisements and oh, an unlisted number "
"Martin: Hey, well don't stop there Maybe you could post some guards on the roof who can shoot people as they try to get in. "
"Frasier: Never mind him. I believe, Niles. Do you believe? "
"Niles: I believe. "
"Otto: Have you decided what you'd like? "
"Frasier: Yes. I'd like the whole damn place Right from the wine cellar to the rafters "
"Otto: And for the lady? "
"TO: opening night at Le Freres Heureux. "
"Niles: We're a hit, a palpable hit. Every table in the place is full. Except for that tiny one, wedged in that horrible dank little corner next to the men's room. "
"Frasier: No, no, no, Niles. That is not a dank little corner next to the men's room. That is the “Enchanted Grotto.” "
"Niles: I've been getting nothing but compliments. "
"Frasier: Yes, Chef Maurice has really outdone himself. The menu simply cannot be improved upon. "
"Niles: I agree. Mmm, unless it would be to add just a soupçon of brandy to the cherries jubilee? "
"Frasier: Mmm. Yes, yes. I want those cherries to be jubilant. "
"Frasier: Daphne, Dad, everything all right here? "
"Daphne: Oh yes, Dr. Crane. Whatever this anguille is, it's perfectly smashing "
"Frasier: It's our chef's specialty. The man can do things with eels you just wouldn't believe "
"Martin: I arrested a guy for that once. "
"Daphne: You and your brother really pulled it off, Dr. Crane. "
"Frasier: Yes, well, sorry to disappoint you Dad, but the restaurant is a success. By tomorrow we'll be the toast of Seattle. "
"TO: the kitchen. The sous-chef is puttering around a large "
"Niles: What's in there? "
"Chef: Anguille. "
"Niles: Dear God "
"Chef: It's Maurice's specialty. He prefers to kill them to order, then serve them with their heads still on. "
"Niles: Thank God his specialty isn't roast beef. "
"Niles: Are those the soufflés for table nine, Maurice? "
"Maurice: I'm just about to bake them. "
"Niles: I know it's not my place to second guess your presentation, but would you be averse to trying something radical? "
"Maurice: What? "
"Niles: Well, instead of individual soufflés, bake one large soufflé and dish the portions out at the table. When people hear the name Niles Crane, I want them to think “Big souffle.” "
"Maurice: As you wish. "
"Waiter: There's a party at the door without a tie or a reservation. "
"Niles: Leave them to me. "
"Bulldog: Hey, Miles, baby "
"Niles: Good evening, Mr. Briscoe. May I help you? "
"Bulldog: Does it look like I need help tonight? "
"Niles: Do you have a reservation? "
"Bulldog: Okay, okay, I know what you're sniffin' around for. These guys are all alike. Mr. Lincoln wonders if you've got a table for the Bulldog and his lady. "
"Niles: Well, Mr. Lincoln's in luck. Please, seat these people in “The Enchanted Grotto.” "
"Frasier: Niles, the Grotto? Oh, Bulldog, enjoy our finest table. "
"Bulldog: There, you see that? Little flash of green and you get anything you want. But look who I'm telling. "
"TO: the kitchen as Frasier enters. "
"Frasier: Um, Maurice? It's not to second-guess your creativity, but... I thought we agreed that we would serve the soufflés in individual cups. "
"Maurice: But I was asked to change. "
"Frasier: Change on opening night? Good lord, no, no. Start pouring, man. "
"Frasier: Dad, Daphne, if you’re almost finished, I can call for your car. "
"Daphne: You know, your parking attendant looked familiar. "
"Frasier: It was Otto, the waiter. Didn't have the heart to let him go, so... Hello, Otto? "
"Otto: Who is this? "
"Frasier: Dr. Crane, Otto. Please bring up car forty-four, please. Thank you. Little innovation of mine. This way, your car will be waiting when you're finished. "
"TO: the kitchen where Niles spots Maurice with the soufflés. "
"Niles: Maurice, I thought we agreed, one large bowl for the soufflé. "
"Maurice: This is crazy This is my kitchen "
"Niles: Well, it's in my restaurant, so one big bowl, chop chop [to a waiter] And you, you, you Table twelve is still waiting for their entrée. Don't force me to send them complimentary zucchini. "
"Waiter: Uh, that's the “In” door, sir. "
"Niles: Good lord, I wonder what I hit. "
"TO: the dining room. A waiter is laid out in front of the doors, "
"Bartender: What happened? "
"Frasier: I think this man must've fainted. Here, help me get him into the kitchen. "
"Bartender: That's the “Out” door "
"Frasier: Well, no harm done. "
"TO: the kitchen as they carry the unconscious waiter in. "
"Niles: Good lord, I think his nose is broken. "
"Chef: What should we do? "
"Niles: Well for one thing, start ladling out zucchini. "
"Chef: That one's out cold. "
"Bartender: Give me a hand, I'll take them both to the emergency room. "
"Frasier: Yes, that's a good idea. Please help this man. "
"Niles: Frasier, true to our name I'm trying to remain a happy brother, but do you find it just the tiniest bit discouraging that suddenly we find ourselves with neither waiters nor a bartender? "
"Frasier: First rule of the kitchen, "
"Niles: remain calm. "
"Frasier: NO, NO, NO I told you individual cups, you oaf "
"Niles: I told him one large bowl. "
"Frasier: Are you out of your mind? You told him what? "
"Niles: Oh, fine, now what? "
"Frasier: Simple. We’ll just make a battlefield promotion. "
"Frasier: Congratulations You are our new head chef. "
"Chef: Sank you. "
"Frasier: Now make us proud We've got a lot of very important clientele out there. "
"Niles: Yes, the Governor's table alone has two state senators and the head of the Immigration Bureau. "
"Chef: Sacre Merde "
"Frasier: Any other names you'd like to drop? "
"Niles: Fine, now we have no chef "
"Niles: No... No... Put the hat down No, no... "
"Frasier: You are our new head chef. "
"Niles: Don't be absurd, I can't possibly cook all this food "
"Frasier: Oh, of course you can, Niles. My God, most of the meals are already started. Dad and Daphne can help us out. [into the walkie-talkie] Otto, cancel car number forty-four. "
"Otto: Who is this? "
"Frasier: It's Dr. Crane It's always Dr. Crane, I'm the only one on here "
"Frasier: Dad, Daphne, we need your help, we've had a little disaster. "
"Martin: Disaster? "
"Frasier: Will you... The entire staff has walked out, it's a long story, but Daphne, I need you in the kitchen; and I need you behind the bar, Dad. You can gloat later. "
"Martin: I'll pencil it in. "
"Daphne: Well, it won't be the first time I've had to wash dishes for my supper, but who's going to wait on all these tables? "
"Roz: Oh, Frasier... "
"Frasier: Roz Roz Roz Oh, Roz "
"Roz: I'm glad to see you too. Frasier, this is my date, Brad. "
"Frasier: Brad, pleasure. "
"Roz: Pretty great, huh? "
"Frasier: Oh, yes, yes. "
"Roz: So, you've got our special table? "
"Frasier: Yes, I certainly have. But before you sit at it, there's something I want to discuss with you. [He leads her to the kitchen.] "
"Roz: It's probably some kind of surprise. "
"Frasier: Oh, try to fool you... "
"Martin: What's your poison? "
"Brad: Oh, I don't know. Maybe I should wait for Roz. "
"Martin: I'd have one now. "
"Roz: Blackmailer "
"Roz: Honey? Listen, I'm really, really sorry, but Frasier's a dear friend and his waiters have had a terrible accident and this is his grand opening and he really, really needs my help so I hope you'll try to understand. "
"Brad: No problem. Listen, could I get a menu and maybe some bread and butter? "
"Frasier: Dad... "
"Martin: Hey, buddy. You from around here? How 'bout those Supersonics? "
"Frasier: Listen, Niles is starting to panic in the kitchen. I don't know if we're going to be able to pull this thing off. "
"Martin: Why don't you just level with them? Tell 'em what happened. People are more understanding than you think. "
"Frasier: Well, maybe you're right. Maybe honesty is the best policy. Everyone? Excuse me. Ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to say... "
"Gil: Good evening, Frasier. "
"Frasier: Bon appetite Gil Gil, my God, what a surprise to see you. I thought you never reviewed opening night. "
"Gil: You're my friend. I made an exception. And as a special surprise, I brought an entire table of restaurant critics. "
"Frasier: Oh, well, that's... We're so booked up I don't know if we can accommodate you. "
"Gil: Oh, we'll take that one over there. We don't mind squeezing in. "
"Gil: We're simply salivating to try your anguille. We hear your chef's an absolute wizard with eels. "
"Frasier: Well, that was his old specialty. You really must try his new "
"specialty: scrambled eggs. [Gil gives him a very dry look] Eels it is. "
"TO: the kitchen. Niles and Daphne are frantically making dishes. "
"Roz: Okay, table four wants to make some "
"changes: they want the sole beranica without the grapes. [Daphne begins flicking off the grapes.] Spinach instead of broccoli and risotto instead of pasta. They also want the swordfish but hold the capers... "
"Daphne: Oh, for heaven's sakes, can't you just tell them no substitutions? "
"Roz: I have trouble saying no. "
"Niles: So the guidebooks tell us. "
"Roz: You want to get thrown in the tank with the rest of the eels? "
"Daphne: Well, you're not making this very easy. You waltz in here, queen of the waitresses, la-di-da, extra broccoli, hold the capers, and then you go back out on the fun side of the door. "
"Roz: You want to trade places with me, Mary Poppins? Be my guest "
"Niles: How dare you use that tone with her "
"Frasier: ALL RIGHT, STOP IT Get a grip. You're not being asked to do anything that none of us hasn't done before in our own kitchens in our own homes. Now quick, Niles, kill five eels "
"Niles: Wait, wait What? "
"Frasier: I'm serious Every restaurant critic in Seattle is out there and they all want anguille, so start killing eels "
"Niles: Wait, wait How do you suggest I do that? "
"Frasier: How do I know? You're the chef. Throw a toaster in the damn tank for all I care "
"Frasier: Not to worry, Gil, the eels are on their way. "
"Gil: Our mouths are watering, Frasier. "
"Frasier: Our chef is in the process of... "
"Frasier: ...frying them now. "
"Customer: Excuse me. This is veal piccata, I ordered veal marsala. "
"Frasier: So it is. I'll rectify that at once. I'll be right back. "
"Frasier: Niles, this veal piccata has to be veal marsala "
"Niles: Now it is. "
"Roz: The mayor's table all want cherries jubilee for dessert. "
"Frasier: All right, fine. You flame them, I'll be out to serve them. "
"Frasier: Niles, how are those eels coming? "
"Niles: I'm just trimming them now. [hacks at the water with a cleaver] "
"Frasier: Oh no, Niles Take them out of the tank "
"Niles: Not until I'm sure they're dead "
"Daphne: Oh, for heaven's sakes "
"Frasier: What was that? "
"Roz: Big blue flash... cherries everywhere... "
"Daphne: Lucky it didn't set off the sprinkler system. "
"Frasier: Yes, fortunately we have a built-in safety delay for just this sort of thing. It gives you fifteen seconds before the sprinklers... ...kick in. "
"Daphne: Where do I turn that off? "
"Frasier: Right over there. "
"Niles: I hope you're satisfied You've thinned my brown sauce "
"Frasier: Good news That was just a test "
"Customer: I want my car, now "
"Frasier: Yes, ma'am, right away. Quick, Otto, bring car twenty-three right away. "
"Otto: Who is this? "
"Frasier: It's the voice of God "
"Bulldog: Hey Doc, Doc. Great touch with the sprinklers My date's dress is clinging to her like Saran Wrap "
"Frasier: Ladies and gentlemen, every restaurant has its little adjustment period. I'm sure someday you'll look back on this and remember it as an adventure "
"Gil: And if they don't remember it, I'll remind them. "
"Frasier: Now for those of you who are leaving, please keep us in mind for your next special occasion. We plan many new and exciting innovations in the weeks to come. "
"Frasier: Starting with our... our drive-through window. "
"Otto: Number twenty-three is ready. "
"TO: "
"Niles: How much firepower do you suppose is necessary to imbed a cherry in an acoustic ceiling tile? "
"Frasier: Another question we should have asked ourselves before we entered the exciting world of food service. "
"Martin: Man, those eels are starting to stink. "
"Niles: Dad, for an hour you've been circling us like a shark. Why don't you just give us your little speech and get on with it? "
"Martin: Hey, come on, I know you guys. You're gonna punish yourselves enough without me chimin' in. "
"Frasier: Thanks. "
"Niles: Appreciate it. "
"Martin: Hey, I'm your dad. "
"Martin: Hello, Happy Brothers Restaurant. Table for two? Yeah, no problem. Smoke-damaged or non-smoke-damaged? "
"Frasier: You know, we could tell people he died in the explosion. "

"Frasier: Well, Caroline, if you've been in therapy for two years and you're feeling like you're no longer making any progress, perhaps you've reached a plateau, or you and your therapist have simply gone as far as you can together. "
"Caroline: Maybe it is time for a change. He's kind of dry and long-winded. "
"Frasier: Well, two years is certainly a long time to spend with a psychiatrist you find dry and long-winded. "
"Roz: A-men to that "
"Caroline: Thanks, Dr. Crane. You've given me a lot to think about. Would it be OK if I called back sometime and picked your brains? "
"Frasier: Well, just consider me your mental banjo. Well, that's it for this fine Friday, Seattle. This is Frasier Crane saying, 'we'll see you next week.' "
"Roz: Good show, Frasier. "
"Frasier: Oh, Roz. I've been waiting for this moment the entire week. "
"Roz: That's what I love about you, Frasier. You work hard and you play hard. "
"Frasier: Roz, you have no idea how much I've been looking forward to this weekend. There comes a time when even the most conscientious of psychiatrists has had his fill of other people's problems. "
"Boy: Hi. Is one of you Roz Doyle? "
"Frasier: Yes... that's all the clues we're going to give you. "
"Frasier: A little offering from one of your suitors perhaps? A nice string of pearls? A teardrop pendant? "
"Roz: It's a brick of cheese "
"Frasier: Well, on the right chain I can see that looking smart. "
"Roz: It's from my family. They're in Wisconsin at my Uncle's dairy farm having a family reunion. "
"Frasier: Oh, why didn't you go, Roz? "
"Roz: There wasn't time. But now I wish I'd gone. Frasier, we always have so much fun. Like this one time there was this huge cheese party and one of my uncles started speaking in cheese language. You know, like instead of saying, 'Hello, how are you?' he'd say, 'Hello, Havardy.' Someone else would go 'Oh, I'm Gouda.' Oh I don't know, what would come after that? "
"Frasier: If I'd been there, the sound of a gunshot "
"Roz: Don't make fun. I miss those people. "
"Frasier: Oh, Roz, oh... There, there. "
"Roz: We play games and sing songs. "
"Frasier: Oh, of course. I know. "
"Roz: And Aunt Libby does cannonballs into the lake. "
"Frasier: Oh yes, the memories must be... "
"Roz: And Uncle Ned has too much to drink and he starts putting pants on all the cows "
"Frasier: Listen, Roz. If what you're looking for is family fun tonight, why don't you come to my place? It's my Dad's birthday. I completely forgot about it last year and I'm going to make up for it this year. There's just one rule. No work, just a good time. "
"Roz: Frasier, I don't think I'd be much fun. "
"Frasier: Roz, I insist. There's no one I enjoy partying with more than you and I just hate to see you like this. I Camembert it "
"Roz: Oh. So sweet. "
"Frasier: All right, it's someone's birthday I hope you're all in the mood for a party. I know I am. "
"Daphne: YOU'RE BLOODY IMPOSSIBLE "
"Martin: AND YOU'RE A BLOODY NAG "
"Daphne: DON'T YOU SHAKE THAT CANE AT ME "
"Martin: QUACK QUACK QUACK - hey "
"Frasier: Oh, for heaven's sake, not again "
"Martin: Just decided what I want for my "
"birthday: fire Daphne "
"Daphne: You'd have to re-hire me first, because I quit I hope I never see this place or that hateful old canker sore ever again. "
"Frasier: Okay, what is it this time? "
"Daphne: The usual. I ask him to do his exercises and he twists his face up like a mewling little baby. "
"Martin: Why don't you tell him how you asked me to do it - by pouring my beer down the sink and banging on the spaghetti pot with a wooden spoon? "
"Daphne: I'm here for your health. I don't have to be your friend. "
"Martin: Well, that's good Because I've got a friend here [gestures to Eddie] who doesn't happen to be a yammering nag "
"Daphne: Eddie, fetch. "
"Frasier: Oh, stop this You two are having the same argument all the time. You can just pick this up again tomorrow. Tonight we are going to have a party. Dad, I went down and got your favorite lemon cake. I also got some snacks and some champagne. Can we all just agree to try and have a little fun this evening? Now that is probably Roz. She's been very down this week and what she's in need of is a very happy and carefree environment. Frankly, I could use the same thing. Now can we just agree to maybe a truce? Martin/"
"Daphne: Yeah, well if she keeps her mouth shut.../If he can keep his big... "
"Frasier: Roz "
"Roz: Hey, Martin. "
"Martin: Hey "
"Roz: Happy Birthday "
"Martin: Oh, you didn't have to do this. Hey, thanks, Roz I'll have to model it for you later. "
"Daphne: He's already modeling the last one someone gave him. "
"Martin: Quack "
"Frasier: Listen, I have a very nice evening planned. Can we all just try to be civil? "
"Niles: You unprincipled charlatan You unconscionable fraud Happy Birthday, Dad. "
"Martin: Thanks. "
"Frasier: Niles, what are you talking about? "
"Niles: You spoke to a patient of mine today, Caroline. As a result of your fast-food approach to psychiatry, she left me "
"Frasier: Caroline was your patient? "
"Niles: Two years of my hard work wiped out by one of your two- minute McSessions. "
"Frasier: Niles, I merely suggested that she consider a change. "
"Niles: Based on what diagnostic method? One potato, two potato? "
"Daphne: Oh, fancy that. A member of the Crane family who doesn't take the time to do something. "
"Martin: Quack "
"Niles: Exactly, Dad. Quack. "
"Martin: I was talking to her. "
"Niles: Don't you raise your cane at her "
"Frasier: NO, WAIT Roz, where are you going? "
"Roz: I think I'd better leave. "
"Frasier: We were just talking. That wasn't fighting. We were talking. "
"Roz: I'd really just rather be by myself. Thanks, guys. I had a wonderful time. "
"Frasier: Well, I hope you're happy. You've ruined her evening. "
"Martin: Her evening? It's my birthday. "
"Daphne: Right. Well, let's get that underway right now. Who’s ready for cake? "
"Martin: I certainly don't want to keep anybody here a second longer than they have to be so let's get this over with. Thanks for a great party "
"Niles: Well, there's nothing wrong with Dad's lungs. "
"Daphne: Every light in the city is out. It must be a blackout. "
"Frasier: Don't panic. There's certainly worse places we could all be in a blackout. "
"Niles: Like the elevator. "
"Frasier: Oh my God, Roz "
"Martin: Why couldn't it be Daphne? STOP DOING THAT "
"Daphne: We just need to get some light in here. "
"Martin: Eddie, where are you? "
"Daphne: Oh, excuse me, Dr. Crane. "
"Niles: Quite all right, Daphne. "
"Frasier: Oh, Daphne, where are the hurricane lamps? "
"Daphne: They're in the kitchen. I'll get them. "
"Frasier: All right. Dad, why don't you light a fire? "
"Daphne: Oh, excuse me, Dr. Crane. "
"Niles: Not your fault, Daphne. "
"Martin: Eddie Where are you, Eddie? "
"Frasier: I've found him "
"Daphne: Well, that's better. "
"Martin: I'm going to go get my radio. See what the hell's going on. "
"Frasier: All right. "
"Frasier: Oh Roz, Roz You’re all right. "
"Roz: I'm fine. The blackout hit just as the elevator doors opened on the fourteenth floor. So I stood in the hallway trying to decide whether to come back in here with you guys or take my chances on the pitch-black streets with the muggers and the weirdos. So I went down a couple of flights... and then I changed my mind. Meanwhile someone's probably looting my apartment "
"Niles: Yes. I hear there's a thriving black market in badly- designed Formica coffee tables. "
"Roz: At least I have my own sense of style. You won't even buy a chair unless some fey French aristocrat has sat his fat satin fanny in it "
"Niles: Louis the Fourteenth was not fey Everyone wore garters in the eighteenth century. "
"Frasier: People... people... SILENCE, ENFANTS Now we can all sit here in the dark and be miserable or we can try to have some fun. "
"Niles: I'm going to call Maris. "
"Frasier: Well, Niles has voted. Who votes for fun? "
"Roz: I'm going to go and get a big glass of wine. "
"Daphne: Well, it looks like the steaks we were going to have are out. I better go and see what I can find. "
"Frasier: Thank you, Daphne. "
"Daphne: Oh, sorry, Dr. Crane "
"Niles: Excuse me, Daphne. "
"Martin: The power is out all over south Seattle. They're working on it now. "
"Niles: Hello, Maris. Thank God I got you. Listen, darling, there is no need to panic. The most important thing is to stay calm... About the blackout. Maris? Take off your slumber mask. [Niles suddenly holds the phone away from his ear] Ooh No darling, darling, don't panic. Honey, no, honey, hon, ho- ho- h... [turns the phone off and puts it back in his pocket] She's fine. "
"to: Kitchen "
"Daphne: Ooh, yum, scrum, pig's bum. Here's something nice. Half- gallon tubs of Cookies & Cream and Vanilla Fudge. "
"Roz: Mmm, well let's take care of these right away before they melt. "
"Frasier: Well, there's no need to worry, ladies. The freezer will keep them cold for at least 24 hours. "
"Roz: Shut up "
"to: Living "
"Room: "
"Martin: Well, I don't like to get nostalgic but it was sure great last year when you forgot my birthday "
"Frasier: You know what we need to do? We need to liven things up a little bit. How about a game? What was that game we played at the Rambican's when they were costuming the servants for the living chess match. It was... er... oh yes, I remember – 'I'm the dullest person.' "
"Roz: At least pick a game someone else has a chance of winning. "
"Frasier: Well, that's got things shakin’. OK, come on, Dad. "
"Frasier: What the game is – we all get pennies and we're supposed to try and get the other person's pennies. "
"Martin: Please, slow down "
"Frasier: All right now. If I was going to go I would say, 'I am the dullest person because... I have never been on a rollercoaster.' All right? And then all of you that have been on a rollercoaster would give me a penny. Now we all have our pennies. Who would like to go first? Daphne? "
"Daphne: I can't think of anything. "
"Frasier: Of course you can. Just say the first thing that comes into your mind. I'm the dullest person because... "
"Daphne: Oh, I don't know. Because I've never made love in a lift or a phone booth or on an aeroplane or a merry-go-round. "
"Frasier: OK – that's good, but strategically speaking that's not the best way to get our pennies. You see it should be something that someone else might have actually... [Roz throws in a penny] ...done. "
"Roz: I was in college. I was trying to find myself. "
"Niles: All you needed to do was look under the nearest man. "
"Frasier: All right, Dad. Get our pennies. "
"Martin: All right. I'm the dullest person because... I've never been to France. "
"Frasier: Good, Dad. That's getting into the spirit of it. All right, Niles. What's something you've never done? "
"Niles: Well, let's see. I'm the dullest person because I've never sabotaged my brother's career. "
"Frasier: Will you give it a rest "
"Daphne: Oh, your father could show you how to do that. "
"Martin: Quack Quack "
"Roz: WILL YOU PEOPLE STOP? You are torturing me. I could report you to Amnesty International. "
"Martin: That's it, I'm outta here. "
"Frasier: Oh, Dad, Dad. You haven't even cut your cake yet. Where are you going? "
"Martin: I'm going to sit in the tub with a hairdryer and wait for the power to come back on. "
"Niles: Well, this blackout could go on all night. It's time I braved the dark streets and got back to my Maris. I just hope it isn't like the lightning storm last month. The only way I could coax her out from under the bed was by tying a Prozac to the end of a string "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Roz. Like to have a little cake? "
"Roz: No, thanks. This reminds me of Wisconsin. All dark and deserted. "
"Frasier: That's on the license plate, isn't it? Roz – what's the real reason you didn't go to your reunion? You've always made it before. "
"Roz: Well... no, no. You said you didn't want to hear any more problems today and I don't blame you. "
"Frasier: I think we have time for one more caller. "
"Roz: Well... every year I go to my reunion. My relatives crowd around me and I answer the same questions. No, I'm not married. No, I don't have any kids. Yes, I still have that tattoo. No, you can't see it. It would just be so nice if I could at least say I have a great career. "
"Frasier: Roz, you do have a great career. "
"Roz: Tell that to my relatives. You know according to them I spend four hours on the phone every day with a bunch of losers and wackos, then I turn them over to some tedious know-it-all who gives them pointless advice. [Frasier looks none too amused] Oh, that's not me talking. That's my Uncle Ned. "
"Frasier: Oh, yes – the cow haberdasher. You know, Roz – ten years ago KACL didn't have any women producers? You're a pioneer. You've won awards. You help people. "
"Roz: Sounds right when you say it. "
"Frasier: Maybe you're just looking for too much from your job. Start exploring other areas of your life. Interests. Maybe a serious relationship? "
"Roz: Maybe you're right. I mean, how long can I go on chasing these hunky twenty-five year-olds that are all looks and no substance? "
"Frasier: Exactly, Roz. "
"Roz: No, I'm serious. I'm asking, how long? Three, four years? "
"Daphne: Oh, bloody hell "
"Frasier: Daphne? Are you all right? "
"Daphne: I've broke your father's souvenir spoon rest from Atlantic City. "
"Frasier: Oh, good. "
"Daphne: You know – when I have my own kitchen I'm going to put my food right on the damn counter. I've always said as soon as I've saved two thousand dollars I'll get my own place. "
"Frasier: Well, how much have you saved? "
"Daphne: Four thousand. Oh, I know what you're thinking. What's wrong with me? Why do I stay here? "
"Frasier: No, I was just thinking I must be paying you too much. "
"Daphne: My friends all say you should be on your own. Have a place. Have a life. Why do I stay here? "
"Frasier: Could it be that, maybe, you like us? You know my Grandmother used to have a cat. A mangy old thing. Kept ruining the furniture and stuff. I asked her why she kept it and she said that maybe it was because she liked having another heartbeat around the house. "
"Daphne: It just makes me feel like I'm not very ambitious. I could be working in a hospital or a clinic. "
"Frasier: Of course you could, Daphne, but maybe that's not what's important to you right now. I think you like being part of a family. What's wrong with that? "
"Daphne: Nothing, I suppose. Although my friends wonder how I can live with such demanding men? "
"Frasier: They call me demanding, do they? "
"Daphne: No. Actually they call you a pompous ass "
"Frasier: And now you've learned that I'm not? "
"Daphne: No. I've learned to work around it. "
"Martin: Excuse me, I'm getting a beer. And yes, I know it's not good for me. And yes, I know it's going to make me fat. And yes, I know it'll keep me from doing my exercises. Do you have anything to add to that? "
"Daphne: Yes Happy Birthday, you old sod "
"Martin: They try to confuse you on purpose. [takes a swig from his beer before putting it down in disgust] Room temperature Just like merry old England. Another place that I'll probably never get to. "
"Frasier: Dad, you used to talk about going to Europe when your hip improves. Now you're saying you'll never get there? What's changed? "
"Martin: Nothing My hip's the same as it was a year ago. I had it in my head it would be better by now, but I'm not and I'm probably never going to be. Ah, you don't understand. You're happy just sitting on your can, doing your little radio show, living inside your head. But I'm used to being out there. "
"Martin: Eddie "
"Frasier: Listen, Dad. You can still travel. You can. You can't walk around Paris – you can sit at a nice café and let Paris walk past you. Maybe buy a glass of wine for a beautiful Mademoiselle. Get yourself a nice bottle of imported beer. "
"Martin: I only like Ballantines. "
"Frasier: In Paris, Ballantine's is imported beer. And you are the handsome american with the adorable accent. "
"Martin: They like moustaches over there, don't they? "
"Niles: Nineteen floors down to my car Garage door's electric Can't open Twenty floors back up Lost count Bad lady upstairs Big dog Need place to die "
"Roz: Same to you, buddy "
"Martin: Who are you talking to? "
"Roz: Some rowdy guys downstairs. Come on out here, Martin. I want you to introduce us. "
"Martin: All right. Keep your pants on. "
"Frasier: Here, Niles. Let me take your coat. "
"Niles: Oh, haven't you taken enough from me today? "
"Frasier: Oh, Niles. You're being silly and irrational. "
"Niles: Sticks and stones. "
"Frasier: You're acting just like Dad. "
"Niles: You take that back "
"Frasier: You know you're not really mad at me, Niles. You know I didn't tell that woman to leave you. I merely suggested it as an option. It was all her choice. Could it be that you're really upset just because you couldn't help that woman? "
"Niles: You know, I really hate that. When you take a simple criticism and you turn it back on me. "
"Frasier: I think I'm right. "
"Niles: Well, of course you're right. Why do you think I hate it? Do you have any idea what I went through trying to help that woman? "
"Frasier: Yes, I think I do. Niles, you're a perfectionist. As faults go that's not such a bad one to have. "
"Niles: It just would have been nice if I could have been the one to tell her that it was time to go. Instead she had to hear it from some glib, albeit insightful radio pundit "
"Roz: Those rowdy guys downstairs invited us to a blackout party. "
"Martin: They have cold beer. "
"Roz: And Carlsberg. "
"Daphne: You know, it's funny. I was feeling a bit down before but suddenly I'm in a party mood. "
"Frasier: What about our party? "
"Roz: There are people downstairs. "
"Martin: They have a barbecue. "
"Niles: Come on, Frasier. "
"Frasier: No, no, no thank you. I'm not really in the mood anymore. "
"Daphne: Don't be a party pooper. "
"Martin: Oh, let him be. He's always been that way. "
"Frasier: Excuse me Just a second. I think maybe it's time for a little lesson about what it's like to live the life of this particular party pooper. I spend the whole damn week ministering to the troubled and the neurotic and the sometimes just plain goofy. Then I hang up my earphones and it doesn't end there. Out on the street, at the café, even in this building – more people come up for help, more problems. I suppose they just think it's OK, it's what I do. But every time I try to help them it costs me a little piece of myself. A little bit here, a little bit there, a little bit here, a little bit there... until I end up feeling like a zebra carcass on the Serengeti surrounded by burping vultures Well, this happened to be one of those weeks. I had my escape planned. I was going to come home for an evening of fun with my extended family. What do I get? I get the four of you going at each other like the Borgias on a bad day So I roll up my sleeves, and I tend to each one of you. And you all feel better. And the minute you get a whiff of mesquite coming from down below, you are out the door without so much as a “thank you.” Well, thank you for the invitation, but I am, frankly, fed up with people and their problems. The Doctor is out. "
"Frasier: Okay, apologies accepted "
"Frasier: No, no... look, I-I love you all. I really do. But what I want right now is to be left alone, right here, where no one needs anything from me. "
"Martin: Well, OK. I'll bring you some barbecue. "
"Roz: Oh my God, it's dark out here... "
"Frasier: Oh, for God's sake, Eddie. No, I'm not going to do it. No. "

"Martin: Come on in Come on, it's all over He won't mess with you Are you nuts? That was a Doberman "
"Daphne: Oh dear, what happened? "
"Martin: Oh, get the first aid kit. Eddie got into a fight. We were on the elevator with that Doberman from upstairs. Eddie took a perfectly innocent sniff, and wham "
"Frasier: Morning, all. What's all this? "
"Daphne: Eddie was viciously attacked. "
"Frasier: Oh. Is that coffee cake I smell? "
"Martin: Well, now that I look at it, it's just a scratch. But I probably should take him to the vet's anyway. "
"Daphne: What are you doing up so early? "
"Frasier: Oh, the new station manager's taking over today. She wanted to meet with all of us. "
"Martin: 'She?' Oh, working for a woman, huh? "
"Frasier: Yes, why? "
"Martin: Well, it's tough on guys, taking orders from a woman. We resent it "
"Frasier: That's absurd. If I had trouble taking orders from a woman, Frederick would never have been conceived "
"Daphne: My brothers couldn't stand taking orders from me. I was forever telling them, 'Billy, clean your room,' 'Reginald, get your elbow out of the gravy,' 'Nigel, take that thing back to the hospital, the whole house is full of flies' "
"Frasier: Morning, Niles. "
"Niles: Hello, Frasier. Dad, Daphne. Uh, I can't stay, I just wanted to ask a favor. Dad, can I borrow your gun? "
"Martin: Maris taking singing lessons again? "
"Niles: No. Our home security system is down for repairs, and with no electric gates I'll just feel safer if I'm packing heat. "
"Frasier: Oh, for heaven's sake, Niles, you don't even know how to pack a lunch. "
"Niles: Dad, please. Maris is a wreck ever since she found out our entire neighborhood watch is wintering in Palm Beach. "
"Martin: Forget it, you don't know the first thing about guns. "
"Niles: Dad, please. "
"Martin: No I don't believe in civilians having guns. "
"Niles: This isn't fair Maris's mother gave her a gun "
"Martin: Well, then Maris's mother can clean the mess up after she accidentally blows your brains out. "
"Niles: Dad, now you're talking nonsense. Maris's mother has never cleaned anything in her life. "
"Roz: All right, all right, listen up everyone, I've been working the office grapevine, I've got the scoop on the new boss. "
"Gil: Is she going to fire me? "
"Bulldog: Hey, first things first Is she baggable? "
"Roz: Forget it, Bulldog, she'd have you for breakfast. "
"Bulldog: Right, like I ever stick around that long. "
"Roz: Anyway, the word is that she's like this psycho perfectionist. Everyone at her last station was scared to death of her. She's kind of becoming my idol. "
"Bulldog: Hey, what if she hates sports? I need this job. I just promised my mom a new pacemaker. Wait, think I could get her to believe I said 'pasta maker?' "
"Frasier: Now, look, there's no reason for us to give in to our insecurities. We all do good, solid shows. We hardly even know this woman, and already we're painting her as a heartless Medusa "
"Mike: She said my ratings are down. She said I'm not 'hip.' "
"Frasier: Father Mike, are you all right? "
"Mike: The little thug fired me "
"Frasier: I'm so sorry. "
"Gil: Did she say anything else? "
"Mike: She said, 'Send in Frasier.' "
"TO: Manager's Office "
"Kate: Listen, tell the movers I want the couch directly in front of the bookcase. Oh, have a seat. "
"Kate: Uh-huh. Yeah, yes. No, not there In front of the bookcase "
"Kate: Yes, tell her I got somebody here Could we move the furniture later? "
"Kate: Could we do that? Dr. Frasier Crane Kate Costas. "
"Frasier: Kate, what a pleasure. "
"Kate: Likewise. I've been listening to the tapes of all your shows. I love what you're doing. "
"Frasier: Really? Well, thank you very much I like to think of my show as a haven for the tempest-tossed in the maelstrom of everyday life. "
"Kate: Wow. You really talk that way. Anyway, your ratings are very good. But I still think we can do better. Any ideas? "
"Frasier: How to improve my show? That is a tall order. Uh... oh, wait, you know, I was thinking of playing classical music before my intros. Let's say, perhaps, uh, Bartok's Concerto for Orchestra in D Minor. "
"Kate: It's too highbrow. I mean, I love classical music, but to most people it's a big snore. Oh, incidentally, Bartok's Concerto is in C. "
"Frasier: Are you sure? "
"Kate: Positive. I put myself through college working at a classical station. Let's talk about advertising. You've got a great face. I want to see it on t-shirts, I want to see it on park benches, I even want to see it on Frisbees. Everybody in Seattle should be popping it, wearing it, sitting on it "
"Frasier: Wonderful. You know, I hate to nitpick, but I was certain that concerto's in D. I was a music minor at Harvard. "
"Kate: It's in C. It was commissioned by Serge Kosivinsky in 1943 for the Boston Symphony Orchestra, and since then it's been recorded over thirty times—each time, in C. "
"Kate: Also, I think you should start doing theme shows. Devote a whole show to people having extramarital affairs, or devote a whole show to people with aberrant sexual practices. Could you give me a hand with that box over there? "
"Frasier: Of course. [lifts it onto her desk and starts handing her things from it] Uh, Kate, you know, that advertising thing. It's a very good idea. But that-these theme shows, uh, it's a less good idea. You might even say a worse idea. "
"Kate: Why is that? "
"Frasier: Well, uh, I am a doctor, and I'd hate to have the serious work I do be tainted by commercialism. "
"Kate: But you don't mind the Frisbees. "
"Frasier: Well, I don't want to be entirely uncooperative. It's just that, well, you know, I've been in the radio game for some time now, and I think I've learned enough about broadcasting, as they say, to know what it is that makes my show a good show. [lifts the last one ] My God, you've won six Golden Mike awards? "
"Kate: Aren't you sweet to notice. Finally, I would like you to start giving priority to the juicier calls. "
"Frasier: That's called pandering "
"Kate: And that is called a Peabody Award "
"Frasier: Well, what exactly do you expect me to do? Say to a caller, 'Listen, Bob, I'm sorry you lost your job, but unemployment's a snore Why don't you go sleep with your best friend's wife and call in on Monday when it'll be Infidelity Day on the Frasier Crane Show' "
"Kate: I really know what I'm doing here. The psychiatrists at my last station went national. "
"Frasier: Well, you know, I'd rather stay local if going national means sucking at the sump-pump of sensationalism "
"Kate: Well, I'm the boss, Doc. So, pucker up "
"Frasier: Listen, lady, I'm not changing my show. Unless you're willing to explain to the owners why you fired one of your highest- rated hosts, well then there's nothing you can do about it, is there? "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Well, we're coming up on 3 A.M. "
"Keith: I got to disagree with your last two callers. I'm in the same line of work, and I think that what we do is very important People depend on us I got to go, Doc, it's time to powder the jelly donuts. "
"Frasier: Well, I hate to cut short this enthralling symposium, but perhaps we could hear from some non-bakers for a change? "
"Roz: Wrap it up, will you? We're finally done. "
"Frasier: Oh, thank God. Stay tuned for the news, weather, and sports. This is Dr. Frasier Crane, yadda-yadda-yadda, bye. "
"Frasier: Really stunk up the airwaves with that one, didn't we? "
"Roz: Frasier, I want you to flash forward to tonight. It's sometime after midnight. Dennis Abbott and I have just had a glorious meal at Le Ralee. Dennis has just asked me back to his penthouse apartment to see his priceless collection of silk sheets. And I lean forward and whisper, 'I can't. I have to go to work in an hour.' What is wrong with this picture? "
"Frasier: Well, for starters, you at Le Ralee. It's a two-week wait. "
"Roz: So is Dennis Abbott Frasier, we have got to get our old time slot back "
"Frasier: Don't worry, Roz, we will she just moved us to break our spirit. "
"Roz: Well, she can saddle me up and ride me around the coffee room I can't do this again "
"Kate: Good morning. "
"Frasier: Oh, hello. "
"Kate: Enjoying your new time slot? "
"Frasier: As a matter of fact, I found it invigorating Didn't you, Roz? Remember that woman who called in, uh, you know, with the delusions of grandeur? Couldn't understand why nobody liked her. "
"Kate: Well, I hope you explained to her that it's not important that people like her, as long as they respect her. "
"Frasier: Oh yes, respect is important. So is self-respect. "
"Kate: Oh, yes, yes, but some people — and this is so unfortunate — can't tell the difference between self-respect and pig-headedness. "
"Frasier: Yes, but those people are usually rigid little demagogues who don't know the difference between the kind of respect that is earned and the kind of respect that is irrespective ...of what others expect. "
"Kate: Isn't it sad when bad things happen to good sentences? "
"Frasier: I think I made myself clear. "
"Kate: Well, I really do have work to do. I've got to find somebody for your old time slot — now that it's free. "
"Frasier: Good luck "
"Roz: Nice going, Frasier, now she's never gonna give in. "
"Frasier: Steady, Roz. She may have been able to intimidate people in other situations, but here at KACL she'll find that we are not a bunch of spineless twits "
"Bulldog: Hey Is she gone? "
"TO: "
"Martin: You don't want this bacon, I'm giving it to Eddie. "
"Daphne: You know that bacon's not good for him. "
"Martin: Eddie Hey, Eddie Come here, boy "
"Martin: And can't we take that stupid thing off him? "
"Daphne: No The vet said if he scratches the scabs, they'll never heal. And I have noticed that if you sit him next to the telly, Channel Five comes in a lot clearer. "
"Martin: Look at him, he's humiliated "
"Daphne: Yeah, well, it doesn't help that that bully upstairs keeps rubbing it in. "
"Martin: You tell him, boy "
"Frasier: Oh, for God's sake, I am trying to get some sleep I asked you to keep that dog quiet, and instead you outfit him with a megaphone In the last thirty-six hours I haven't had so much as a nap, and I've got to be back at the station by 2 A.M. Eddie, listen carefully. By the time this day is up, one of us is going to sleep. "
"Daphne: Oh, don't worry, Dr. Crane, I'll take Eddie for a walk. And as far as your problem at work goes, if you want my opinion— "
"Frasier: DON'T I've had my share of women's opinions for the week, between the station's new Reichschancellor and Roz's incessant whining As far as I'm concerned, your entire sex can put a sock in it "
"Martin: Boy, you'd never let me get away with a comment like that. "
"Daphne: Oh, even the best of us can get a bit cranky when we're overtired. All Dr. Crane needs right now is a little peace and quiet. Eddie? "
"Frasier: Damn it "
"Niles: Morning, Daphne. Where are you off to? "
"Daphne: Oh, I'm taking Eddie for a walk. "
"Niles: By yourself? "
"Daphne: Yes, of course. Why not? "
"Niles: It's dangerous out there. You never know when you might need... one of these. "
"Daphne: A starter's pistol? Oh, I don't think so, Dr. Crane. But thanks for the thought. "
"Niles: How did she know it wasn't a real gun? It fooled the servants, even the ones who spent years fleeing juntas. "
"Martin: You bought a starter's pistol? "
"Niles: Yes, you see, as long as Maris thinks it's real, it makes her feel secure, but this way no one can get hurt. "
"Frasier: What the hell was that? Was that a gunshot? "
"Niles: Morning, Frasier. Just getting up? "
"Frasier: 'Just getting up?' Are you out of your mind? A gun just went off in here "
"Martin: Niles bought a starter's pistol. "
"Niles: And there's no need to get snippy. Accidents happen, you know. "
"Frasier: Oh, I'm sorry, was I snippy? I didn't realize it was too much to ask that there not be GUNPLAY IN MY LIVING ROOM "
"Martin: You know, Niles, you shouldn't have any kind of gun, really. Come to think of it, now that Mr. Sunshine's home during the day, maybe I shouldn't either "
"Frasier: Just relax. It won't be long before my loyal fans protest, and the afternoon slot is once again home to the compassionate and lovable Dr. Frasier Crane. Now get the hell out, both of you "
"Martin: All right, maybe I can catch up to Daphne in the park. "
"Niles: I'll cover you. "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Hello, Seattle, this is Dr. Frasier Crane. I'll be taking your calls for the next four hours. Roz, who's on the line? "
"Roz: How should I know? I just got here. "
"Frasier: Hello, Line Two, you're on with Dr. Frasier Crane. "
"Mark: Uh, hey, Dr. Crane. It's Mark. "
"Frasier: Hello, Mark. I'm listening. "
"Mark: OK. Uh, well, I work at this all-night mini-mart, and, um, I've been watching myself on the video camera, and the camera-me is doing things I don't approve of. "
"TO: Later "
"Phyllis: People think insomnia is a laughing matter, but it's hell. If I don't get some sleep soon, I'll just—I'll go crazy You've got to help me, Dr. Crane? Dr. Crane? Hey, I'm talking here "
"Frasier: What? I'm listening. "
"Phyllis: So what do you think I should do? "
"Frasier: Well, you know, sometimes these things seem clearer in the light of day. My advice is to sleep on it. "
"Phyllis: Is that some kind of a joke? To make fun of the insomniac? "
"Frasier: Oh, no— "
"Frasier: Oh, oh, and now for a word from, um, uh, ah, [shuffles some papers on his console] I forget, I think they sell paint. "
"Roz: You hear that whooshing sound? It's my career going down the toilet. "
"Frasier: Oh God, Roz, I don't think I've helped a single person tonight. "
"Roz: Helped? You'll be lucky if you don't get sued You told a longshoreman to come out of the closet, and a gay guy to spend more time on the docks "
"Frasier: Well, you're the one who's supposed to keep track of who's on what line "
"Roz: OK, let me make it easy for "
"you: freaks Freaks on Line One Freaks on Line Two Freaks, everywhere "
"Frasier: Roz, Roz, Roz We shouldn't get mad at each other. Oh God, this is all Kate's fault. "
"Roz: You're right, you're right, she's ruining us And there's nothing we can do. "
"Frasier: Yes, there is If we're gonna go down, we're gonna take her down with us We've got one hour left. If she wants raunch, we're gonna give her more raunch than she ever dreamed of Are you with me, Roz? "
"Roz: Just pump up the volume and call me Kitty "
"Frasier: OK "
"Frasier: We're back, Seattle. And in accordance with new station policy, we are going to be pandering to the lowest human instinct. In other words, who wants to talk about SEX? Sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex "
"Frasier: YEAH I want to know who's having sex How you're having it I want to know if you're having it right now "
"Roz: Look, Dr. Crane, the lines are hot Really hot "
"Frasier: Thank you, Kitty. Hello, Caller. What are you wearing? "
"Nancy: Nothing. I'm naked. "
"Frasier: Hey, that's a great idea Let's all get naked Hey, I'm getting naked right now "
"Roz: While Dr. Crane strips, our new station manager would like to know if you prefer to be the spanker, or the spankee. "
"Nancy: Oh, definitely the spanker. "
"Frasier: Well then, hop in a cab I'm not wearing any pants "
"TO: "
"Frasier: While Roz laces up her leather bustier, this is Dr. Frasier Crane, KACL - all talk, all night, all naked "
"Kate: Explain. "
"Frasier: As George Bernard Shaw once said, 'there are two tragedies in life. One is not getting what we want, and the other is getting it.' "
"Kate: You know full well this is not what I wanted You did this to vex me. And you succeeded. And it was not Shaw, it was Oscar Wilde. Did you ever open a book at Harvard? "
"Frasier: You know, one of these days, you're going to misquote someone, and I'm going to land on you like a sumo wrestler "
"Kate: All I wanted, all I wanted was a lousy little theme show once or twice a week "
"Frasier: Oh, yeah 'Frasier Crane takes a leering look at infidelity' "
"Kate: No, not a leering look Just a good look. At the pain of infidelity, at what it does to families, at what it does to children, at what it does to the fabric of society, and this is just off the top of my head. But, no You are such an arrogant gasbag, so used to being cock-of-the-walk around here that you can't stand still for one minute and listen to a perfectly valid suggestion from somebody else "
"Frasier: And you are such a smug egomaniac that your entire self-image would shatter like a cheap mirror if you ever had to admit that you had made a mistake "
"Frasier: You are a classic case of neurotic narcissism, and a first- class SMARTY-PANTS You can go ahead and fire me now. "
"Kate: Yes, I could do that, yeah. But I'm not going to. "
"Frasier: Did you listen to the whole tape? "
"Kate: Oh, yeah. But, unlike you, I put what's good for the station above my personal feelings. "
"Frasier: Well, that's-that's awfully big of you. Guess that means I'll be moving back to my old time slot. "
"Kate: Guess again, Captain Midnight If I give you back your old time slot without your making a single concession to me, that would completely undermine my authority. Being a crack shrink, surely that's within your grasp. "
"Frasier: Grasp "
"this: if I don't get my old time slot, I quit "
"Kate: Grasp "
"this: you do, and I'll sue you for breach of contract "
"Frasier: OK, then it's a stalemate If we don't want to remain entrenched in these positions forever, one of us had better think of something "
"Kate: Yes, one of us better. "
"Frasier: I've got it "
"Kate: Damn "
"TO: Outside Kate’s office. "
"Bulldog: So, we're together, right? "
"Gil: Absolutely. "
"Bulldog: We're not letting her push us around any longer "
"Gil: Nope. You do the talking. I'll stand behind you and burn holes through her with my 'You call this a Hollandaise sauce?' glare. "
"Frasier: I don't care what you say, I like theme shows And I'm going to do them, starting this Friday with 'Frasier Crane takes a look at the consequences of infidelity' "
"Kate: You do, and I'll make you start that show with classical music Bartok's Concerto in C, I don't care how much you hate it "
"Frasier: Damn you "
"Kate: It's my way, or no way. "
"Frasier: You win. Bartok it is. "
"Kate: What do you two want? "
"Bulldog: Nothing. "
"Gil: Keep up the good work. "

"Niles: You try and try, but at some point you finally have to admit, as much as you care about each other, your relationship isn't working and hasn't been for some time. "
"Schachter: But you two wouldn't be sitting here with me if you didn't want to save this relationship. Isn't that true? "
"Niles: Well, I'd be willing to try. I can't speak for... "
"Frasier: You don't have to speak for me, Niles. I'm perfectly capable of speaking for myself. "
"Niles: Yes, I know. Caruso wasn't so in love with the sound of his own voice. "
"Frasier: What is that supposed to mean? "
"Niles: Well, you tell me, Enrico. What do you think it means? "
"Frasier: I guess I can tell you... "
"Schachter: Gentlemen, gentlemen, please Now, are we agreed that we want to do something to fix this problem? "
"Niles: Yeah.../Well, if it's fixable, I suppose... "
"Schachter: All right. Why doesn't one of you tell me how this started? "
"Frasier: Well, it began with me. Last week, I was at work doing my radio show. I was on the air with a troubled young woman. She had just started telling me about a recurring dream she had since childhood. "
"TO: "
"Jill: Okay, I'm in my bedroom, I'd just gotten out of the bath tub to get dressed. When I opened the closet, all my clothes are gone. Suddenly, I hear the sound of footsteps on the drive outside. I turn and there is a little girl with her nose pressed up against the window. "
"Frasier: That is amazing "
"Jill: But her breath is clogging up the glass so that I can't make out her face. Only, I'm sure she's come to tell me something important. "
"Frasier: So, a girl on the other side of a glass with an urgent message. "
"Frasier: And for some reason you're unwilling or able to receive it. "
"Roz: I'm sorry, Dr. Crane, I hate to interrupt, but you're all out of time for today. "
"Frasier: Oh, dear. Um, listen, Jill, I'm terribly sorry, but listen, I'd like to continue talking to you when we're off the air, so please don't hang up. In the meantime, listeners, I've enjoyed our time today. Tune in again tomorrow when we'll be talking with... "
"Bulldog: Blah, blah, Frasier Crane Show, happy health, goodbye "
"Bulldog: Yo, Jill. You a football fan? "
"Jill: Not really. "
"Bulldog: Beat it All right, this is Bulldog, ready to go "
"Frasier: I hate this job. Not only do I have to put up with that annoying little sweat-sock, but when a caller comes in who has a truly fascinating problem, I'm barely even able to scratch the surface. It makes me want to run screaming back to private practice "
"Roz: I can imagine how frustrated you must be. This show's gotta be constraining for a man of your staggering intellect. "
"Niles: Hold it, stop, wait a minute "
"TO: "
"Niles: You expect us to believe that Roz actually used a phrase like 'staggering intellect'? "
"Frasier: It was something like that. "
"Niles: So, she might have said your 'boundless brilliance,' or, say, 'the Olympian reaches of your wisdom.' "
"Frasier: Oh, Niles, do shut up. "
"Niles: Oh, you shut up "
"Schachter: Gentlemen, gentlemen It is not important exactly what was said. "
"Niles: No, what is important is that he assumes it revolves around him, when the truth is it started several days before that, with me. "
"TO: "
"Niles: I'd been having some trouble with the psychiatrist in the office next door. His unconventional therapy had started to intrude upon my sessions. "
"Niles: Mrs. Kelly, the key here is that you trust me. So long as you're in this office you have no reason to feel anything but safe. "
"Niles: Just, please, think of this as your refuge, your sanctuary. "
"Niles: I'm not saying that being a sole survivor of a plane crash wasn't a traumatizing experience for you. But, I can get you to a point where the memories no longer haunt you. "
"Niles: His primal scream madness was ruining my practice. I had to do something. The opportunity presented itself that Friday. "
"TO: "
"scene: Niles is going to "
"Niles: I'd come to Frasier's for dinner. I remember Daphne, my father's health care worker, was telling the most delightful story... "
"Daphne: Oh, I know what you're going though, Dr. Crane, dealing with a noisy neighbour. Have I ever mentioned that couple that lived next door to me in London? A married couple, who made the most un-Godly racket - in bed The walls must have been like tissue paper because I'd hear the whole performance every night. Finally, I decided the only to get them to stop was to let them hear what I'd been hearing. So, one night, I moved near the wall and I started... "
"Daphne: Ooh, that's the spot - Oh, do it again Oh, you are the beastmaster, aren't you? Oh, for heaven's sake, just take me, you devil-spawned sex monkey [tosses her head, flinging her hair wildly about] YES, YES, YES, YES, YES Problem solved. "
"Niles: I'm sorry, Daphne, I drifted. Would you mind telling that story again? "
"Frasier: Hold it, stop "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Niles, you know full well that Daphne merely told us that story, she did not act it out. "
"Niles: Didn't she? "
"Frasier: No Just tell the story "
"Niles: Fine. It was a few hours later... "
"TO: "
"Niles: We were having espresso, and, perhaps to counter-act the stimulative effect, Frasier was telling us about his day. "
"Frasier: You know, I can't stop thinking about my last caller today. Fascinating young woman who had a recurring dream. "
"Martin: You know who's a helluva dreamer? Eddie. "
"Martin: One night I'd wake up, he's lying on my forehead, dead asleep, with a big clump of my hair in his mouth, growlin' Bet you'd love to analyze that little brain of his. "
"Frasier: Yes, that would be the jewel in the crown of my career Still, thinking about this woman has started me longing for private practice. I guess I just miss the chance to dig deep with my patients. "
"Niles: Have you considered seeing patients on the side? "
"Frasier: Oh yes, of course. I've got a list of people who've expressed interest. "
"Niles: Frasier, I have a proposition. I mentioned that doctor in the office next door? Well, his lease is up. If you were interested in his office, as his landlord, I could tell him and his screaming meamies to hit the road "
"Frasier: You? "
"Niles: Mmm-mmm. "
"Frasier: And I? "
"Niles: Mmm-mmm. "
"Frasier: Working side by side? "
"Niles: Mmm-mmm. "
"Frasier: I don't mind telling you the prospect sounds... quite exciting "
"Niles: We could consult on each other's patients. "
"Frasier: We could give seminars together. "
"Niles: Even therapy groups "
"Frasier: Oh, my God, 'Crane & Crane', I can see our logo already; a giant Crane hovering over a human head "
"Frasier: Dad, why are you laughing? Why is Dad laughing? "
"Martin: You two, you'll never learn. "
"Niles: Oh, oh, you think this is a bad idea? "
"Martin: The restaurant you bought together, that was a bad idea The book you tried to write together, that was a bad idea But this.... No, that restaurant was still the stupidest one. "
"Frasier: Two little mis-adventures and you doom us to failure. "
"Martin: Oh, baloney, you've been like this since you were kids. You two can't work together. "
"Niles: Maybe Dad's right. We're not ready for this, it could lead to conflict and tension. "
"Frasier: Hold it "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Niles, tell the truth "
"Niles: Oh, all right. "
"TO: "
"Niles: Stop raining on our parade, Dad "
"Frasier: To 'Crane & Crane' "
"Frasier: Well, our first day together began innocently enough... "
"Frasier: Good morning, Dr. Crane. "
"Niles: And to you, Dr. Crane "
"Frasier: Oh, Niles, why should we be so formal, there's nobody around. "
"Frasier: It's a hi-five, Niles "
"Niles: Oh, oh, oh, sorry. "
"Niles: Would you like a coffee? "
"Frasier: Oh, yes, please. Oh, Niles, I can't tell you how much I've missed that. The smell of the office place. Freshly oiled leather couches, the pungent coffee, the aroma of an exotic luncheon special wafting up from the cafeteria below. "
"Niles: Actually, that's the lab next door. They lost power last night, some of their tissue samples turned. By the way, I've put together some recent articles you may want to peruse just to get up to speed. "
"Frasier: Up to speed? "
"Niles: Well, it has been a while since you've practised and we could all use a little brushing up. "
"Frasier: Well, that's very considerate of you. Just put my homework assignment in my box there. "
"Niles: As you wish. "
"Daphne: All right, where shall we put this then? "
"Frasier: Well, the only place it should go, actually, is right here by the couch, I think. "
"Niles: No, no, Daphne, here on the desk will pick up the earth tones in the carpet. "
"Frasier: No, there's this desk space here by the coffee station. "
"Niles: Oh, underneath the heating vent? Why not just give it a blindfold and a cigarette "
"Frasier: It's your office, put it where you like. "
"Niles: No, no, it is your plant. "
"Daphne: And it's my bleedin' back, so I'm putting it right here "
"Daphne: Honestly, I don't know how you put up with him. "
"Niles: Liar Liar Daphne never said that "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Well, she said it with body language. "
"Niles: I happen to be fluent in that language and she said nothing of the kind "
"Schachter: Will someone tell me what's so important about this plant? "
"Niles: You'll know soon enough. I'm telling the rest of the story. "
"TO: "
"Daphne: I'm putting it right here "
"Martin: You know the best thing about getting old? Your hair may turn grey, your joints may stiffen, you may even have to walk with a cane. But people still ask you to help them move "
"Frasier: Forgive me for overburdening you, Dad. Could you just put those in my office, please? "
"Daphne: Oh, look at your two names together on the door. Er, Dr. Crane, is your brother's name smaller than yours? "
"Niles: Yes, that was the only way it would fit. I assumed you wouldn't mind - after all, we're concerned here with healing people, aren't we? "
"Frasier: Of course, Niles. If I were interested in self-promotion, I guess I'd be content with my radio show, heard every day by over half a million listeners - the Pacific Northwest and parts of Canada "
"Frasier: What are you doing? "
"Niles: I'm moving the Chepalire. "
"Frasier: I like it where it was. "
"Niles: Yes, but it didn't like it there. It wants light. "
"Daphne: You two tend to your plant, I'll go fetch the file cabinet "
"Frasier: I have had this plant for two years and it has never been in direct sunlight. "
"Niles: Well, obviously, look at it, the leaves are puckering "
"Frasier: They are not, they've wilted a little from the ride over in the trunk of the car. "
"Niles: Oh, nonsense, Mafia snitches emerge from car trunks looking more robust "
"Frasier: This plant is going right over... "
"Martin: And so it begins "
"Niles: Of course, the incident with the plant was only the beginning. "
"TO: "
"Niles: That was followed by a run-in at the receptionist's desk, a row at the coffee machine, and a contretemps when Frasier lost the men room's key. "
"Frasier: That was an accident. "
"Niles: Yes, it very nearly was. "
"Frasier: I am so tired of your exaggeration, you always make things fifteen thousand times worse than they are I'm going to tell the story from now on "
"TO: "
"Frasier: The point is, our nerves were, well, pretty much shot by the time we conducted our first therapy group together... "
"Niles: First off, I have a colleague to introduce. He is not only An esteemed psychiatrist, he happens to be my brother, Dr. Frasier Crane. "
"Frasier: Afternoon. "
"Kedlish: Wow, you're Dr. Crane from the radio. "
"Frasier: Guilty as charged. "
"Niles: Yes, but we all have to remind Dr. Crane that this is real psychiatry now, not the radio. No hanging up on the hard ones here "
"Frasier: But rest assured I am trained to deal with a full range of issues. Everything from envy to jealousy But, I'll just be observing today, I don't know you well enough to render any opinions yet, so just pretend I'm not here. "
"Niles: And good luck with that. Mrs. Kalish, perhaps you could bring us up to date on how you're dealing with your divorce. This is week two, isn't it? "
"Kalish: Yes. Well, I actually had my first date last night. "
"Niles: That's wonderful. "
"Frasier: Hmmm... "
"Kalish: Did you say something? "
"Frasier: I don't think so. "
"Kalish: It sounded like 'Hmmm...' like you disapproved. "
"Frasier: Well, since you've asked. I think in divorce we have painful feelings, which are never the less healthy feelings. We start to date too quickly and we want to be sure that that's not panacea for the pain. "
"Niles: Ooh, yes, you'll all find my brother's quite adept with those peppy little bromides; 'panacea for the pain' You can almost hear the "
"phrase: We'll be right back after these words from 'Pringles' "
"Carr: You don't want to wait too long before you date though, either. I waited five years but then I was so desperate I stayed with the first woman who came along. She ended up being the same controlling ice princess as my first wife. "
"Frasier: Hmmm... "
"Niles: Well, Mr. Carr... "
"Carr: Wait, Dr. Crane, it sounded like your brother said something again. "
"Frasier: Well, since you've asked. It occurred to me that by waiting for five and becoming, as you said, desperate, that perhaps you were really giving yourself license to pursue the woman who reminded you of your first wife. You had to repeat the pattern. "
"Carr: So, you're saying that it wasn't an accident? "
"Frasier: We have an expression in "
"psychiatry: 'there are no accidents.' "
"Niles: Now let's check in with news and traffic. "
"Frasier: Dr. Crane, are you denying that most accidents happen for a reason? "
"Niles: No, Dr. Crane, I believe they do. I'm reminded of a recent “accident” involving a four-inch wooden block attached to a men's room key which walked off in somebody's pocket Clearly an act of hostility, wouldn't ya' say? "
"Frasier: Certainly a well-deserved one, considering what an insufferable prig someone has been today "
"Niles: You dare call me a prig after I rescued you from that sideshow you call a radio program? "
"Frasier: One more crack about my show and I'll put that little wooden block in a place you'll always be able to find it "
"Niles: Group, take five minutes of quiet introspection "
"Niles: Frasier, I have made a fist and I'm thinking of using it. "
"Frasier: Niles, you are not scaring me... the thumb goes on the outside, Niles On the outside "
"Niles: How dare you try to steal my group "
"Frasier: I don't need your group I've got a group of my own, half a million strong "
"Niles: Oh yes, your legions Why don't you rent a farm, pass out the body paint and call it 'Frasier-stock' "
"Frasier: You know, I'm just a little tired of your condescending attitude. You have not missed one single opportunity to run down my show or grab a book off the shelf to help me 'get up to speed' My God, you're such a brilliant healer, you've even taken over the care of my Schefflera "
"Niles: Well, you were starving it of sunlight "
"Frasier: All right, fine, let's just give this little dear all the sunlight it needs "
"Niles: Are you insane? "
"Frasier: If I were, 'Doctor,' you'd never know it "
"Niles: Oh... "
"Niles: Is that my group? Group, group, come back, group [they exit and "
"then:] I'm very proud of this show of independence I hope you're happy "
"Frasier: If I were, 'Doctor,' you'd never know it "
"Niles: Stop saying that "
"Schachter: Dr. Crane "
"Niles: Hello, Dr. Schachter. "
"Schachter: What's going on? "
"Niles: I'm having a discussion with my brother. "
"Schachter: I could hear your discussion across the hall in my office. "
"Niles: Well, you see, he waltzed in here like the belle of the ball and yet... "
"Schachter: Now, look, you two are obviously in some distress. As you know, I am a specialist in couples therapy. Now I've never treated brothers before, but still, if you step into my office, I'm sure I can help you. "
"Schachter: Hold it Hold it "
"TO: "
"Schachter: I never said, 'I'm sure I can help you.' I said, 'I may be able to help you.' "
"Niles: See how he twists your words? "
"Frasier: Right here, buddy boy. "
"Schachter: Enough You are doctors I've never seen anything like this in my life. You think he's trying to steal your patients, and you think he's trying to undermine you as a psychiatrist. But you must know what is at the root of this problem. "
"Niles: He is "
"Schachter: No. You have a fundamental lack of trust. Now it may be so deeply rooted by now that it's impossible to change but there are certain exercises that we try provided that you two are willing. "
"Schachter: Let's start with the most basic trust exercise there is. Now, why don't you simply stand on this foot stool and fall backwards into your brother's waiting arms, thus demonstrating that we can trust each other. Dr. Crane, why don't you go first? "
"Niles: Well, all right. "
"Schachter: Just get up there, and let yourself go. "
"Niles: Is he standing directly behind me? "
"Schachter: Yes, now trust your brother. "
"Niles: I'd feel better if he were wearing rubber soles. "
"Frasier: Oh, for God's sake, Niles, just get down, I'll go first. All right? "
"Frasier: Is he in position? "
"Schachter: Yes Trust him "
"Frasier: You should know he catches like a girl "
"Schachter: I don't believe this. Get down, will you? This couldn't be easier I get up here, I count to three, and you catch me. One, two, three. "
"Frasier: Why didn't you catch him? "
"Niles: Well, you were closer "
"Frasier: It was your turn "
"Niles: 'It was my turn'... "
"Schachter: That is it That is it In thirty years as a couples therapist, I've never said what I'm about to "
"say: Give up It's hopeless You are pathologically mistrustful of each another, competitive to the point of madness [gets his coat] So, trust me, just meet each other at weddings and funerals, and the rest of the time, stay the hell away from each other Now, I am going to limp to the nearest pub and drink until the rest of me is as numb as my ass "
"Niles: Well... that's quite a diagnosis. "
"Frasier: Yes. But there is no denying it. We are vindictive and competitive.... "
"Niles: Petty, mistrustful... "
"Frasier: As so often in these cases it took someone outside our situation to point it out to us. "
"Niles: Well, Dad always said it, but he has no credentials. "
"Frasier: Well, there's no arguing with Dr. Schachter's credentials. My God, the man is an expert in his field. He graduated from the University of... "
"Frasier: Grenada "
"Niles: Well, surely that was just his undergraduate schooling. "
"Frasier: Oh yes, of course, his graduate work was done in... Aruba "
"Niles: An all-Caribbean schooling... well, tally me banana "
"Frasier: I knew he was a fraud the minute he opened his mouth. "
"Niles: Oh, I'll have him out of his lease at the end of the week. "
"Frasier: Niles, we still have time to catch a late lunch "
"Niles: Oh, oh, oh, 'Peris' is just around the corner. "
"Frasier: Away we go. Oh, 'Chez Shea' is just as close. "
"Niles: Yes but the food at 'Peris' is much better. "
"Frasier: Oh, Niles. Have you lost your mind? "

"Frasier: Well, we have time for one more caller. Roz? "
"Roz: We have Ed on line three. "
"Frasier: Hello, Ed, I'm listening. Ed? Well, we seem to have lost Ed. Let's take another caller. On line four we have.... Roz? "
"Frasier: Roz? "
"Frasier: We have.... "
"Frasier: Eye... "
"Frasier: Lean. Oh, Eileen. Hello Eileen, I'm listening. "
"Eileen: Dr. Crane, I've been very happily married for twenty years and I wouldn't dream of cheating, but lately when we're making love I find myself fantasizing about people... other than my husband. "
"Frasier: Well, that's perfectly normal. It's quite normal to spice up one's love life by imagining a tryst with, oh, a sports figure or a movie star or... "
"Eileen: Or a radio psychiatrist? "
"Frasier: Excuse me? "
"Eileen: It's your voice, Dr. Crane. You must have the most sensuous voice on earth. "
"Frasier: Oh, I don't know, Eileen. "
"Eileen: I've never seen your picture. Would you mind describing yourself? "
"Frasier: Oh, well I don't really think that's appropriate... "
"Roz: I'll do it. "
"Frasier: Roz, I don't think... "
"Roz: He's about six-one, with a granite jaw and the broad shoulders of a marine. He's been wearing his hair short lately but that only accentuates his cobalt blue eyes, his chiseled cheekbones and his full, provocative lips. "
"Eileen: Wow Thanks Roz, and thank you, Dr. Crane. I'll be thinking of you tonight - with any luck, twice "
"Frasier: Well, this is Dr. Frasier Crane feeling a little red in his chiseled cheeks. Till tomorrow then, this is KACL 780 AM. "
"Frasier: Roz, that was quite a flattering description. You know, just out of "
"curiosity: were you just helping that lady with her fantasy or do you really see me that way? "
"Roz: You really don't know, do you? Frasier, I am so attracted to you, I always have been. Your looks, your voice... "
"Roz: You don't know how many times I've wanted to strip naked and hurl myself at that glass partition like a bug on a windshield. "
"Frasier: Are you through? "
"Roz: Well, ask a stupid question "
"Frasier: All right Roz, I will see you tomorrow. "
"Roz: Hey, aren't you going to the staff meeting? "
"Frasier: No, no, no, just tell them that my aunt died. I'm off to her lawyer’s now, she put me in charge of her memorial. "
"Roz: Oh, I'm so sorry. "
"Frasier: Oh, don't be, she was a dreadful old harpy. Life around her was miserable. "
"Roz: That should look nice on her headstone. "
"Frasier: Well, I don't mean any disrespect but you know, the entire time I knew her she never said anything to me that wasn't scornful, derisive or contemptuous. "
"Roz: So how come she made you in charge of her memorial? "
"Frasier: I was her favourite "
"Frasier: Dad, I thought we had an "
"agreement: Eddie doesn't roll around on the sofa and I don't throw him in front of a bus "
"Niles: Hello, Daphne. "
"Daphne: Oh, hello Dr. Crane. Will you be joining us for dinner? "
"Niles: If it's not too much trouble. It's Maris's night to host her book club and they are more comfortable not having a man there. "
"Frasier: Yes, apparently Niles makes the ladies self-conscious. "
"Niles: Well, I sat in on the last discussion and Mrs. Esterbrook- Kindred developed a facial tic every time she had to say the word 'Balzac.' "
"Martin: So how did it go with Aunt Louise's lawyer? Did you get the old bat's affairs straightened out? "
"Niles: Ask her yourself. "
"Frasier: Apparently, it was Aunt Louise's wish that Niles dispose of her ashes. "
"Niles: Now the pressure's on me to find the perfect place for her to rest for eternity. I haven't the faintest idea what to do with her. "
"Martin: Why don't you just flush her down the toilet? "
"Daphne: Mr. Crane, you can't do that "
"Martin: Why not? She loved the water. "
"Niles: Oh, oh, that's "
"it: the beach. Oh, no, no, she hated seagulls. And vice-versa. It doesn't matter where I pick, you know it's not going to be good enough. Whatever I did she always found fault. Remember when I used to mow her lawn? "
"Frasier: Yes, what about the Christmas tree I bought her? "
"Niles: The ashtray I made at camp? "
"Frasier: 'Is that the best you can do? It wobbles' "
"Niles: I wish I had that ashtray now "
"Martin: So when's the memorial service? "
"Frasier: It's two weeks after tomorrow. Lucky lucky me, her last request was that I deliver the eulogy. "
"Daphne: Oh come on now, you can handle it. You just stand up there and say a few nice things. "
"Frasier: There aren't any "
"Daphne: Then just make them up. Everyone lies a little in eulogies. "
"Frasier: No Daphne, I refuse to invent virtues the woman didn't have. I'll just have to find something good I can honestly say about her. "
"Martin: Good luck She was nothing but a crabby, tight- fisted old pain. All she ever did was sit around that house day after day watching TV. She kept that same old cruddy furniture all her life. "
"Martin: What? "
"Niles: Oh, remember how she always used to complain about the winters? "
"Martin: Oh yeah, every year she was going to take a trip to the South Pacific. It was her big dream. But would she spend the money? Nooooo. She just sat around whining all the time about how she'd like to be in a warmer climate. "
"Frasier: My guess is she finally made it. "
"Daphne: I think it would be terribly bad to go through life having a secret dream and never fulfilling it. You'd never do anything silly like that, would you Mr. Crane? "
"Martin: What're you talking about? "
"Daphne: Oh, I don't know. Perhaps a little something involving a certain shoebox you keep hidden. "
"Frasier: Shoebox? "
"Martin: Forget it, it's not important. "
"Daphne: Oh fine, if you don't want to talk about it, don't talk about it. It's only something you've given over thirty years of your life to. "
"Martin: Hey, I didn't tell you that so you can go around blabbing it to everyone. "
"Frasier: Tell us, dad, what's in the shoe box? "
"Martin: Nothing, all right? "
"Martin: It's just some songs I wrote... for Frank Sinatra. "
"Daphne: And he keeps them in his shoebox. "
"Martin: I think your work here is done. "
"Martin: Your mother and I used to listen to Sinatra all the time. I know most of his songs by heart. I guess I got it into my head one day that I'd try to write a song myself. I'd be at the station house or on a stakeout, I'd get an idea and pretty soon I had a shoebox full. I used to imagine your mother and I seeing Frank in the stands in Vegas and he'd open the show with one of my songs. "
"Frasier: Oh gee, dad, why did you never tell us about this? "
"Martin: Because it is stupid. They were no good... "
"Niles: Oh... "
"Martin: And don't bother to ask, I'm not letting you see 'em. "
"Daphne: Here they are. Just like I told you, in his shoebox. "
"Niles: 'You are the song my soul would sing.' "
"Frasier: Very poetic. "
"Niles: 'You make my heart go ring-a ding-ding.' "
"Martin: That was during Frank's ring-a-ding period. "
"Frasier: Lord, this shoebox is full of them. 'I didn't mean to hurt her, she made me lose my mind'. "
"Martin: Hey, lemme see that No, that's just some confession I took from a guy. The lyrics are on the back. Anyway, I never finished them. They were never any good. Well, except this. I gotta admit this has got 'Frank Sinatra' written all over it. "
"Niles: 'She's such a groovy lady.' "
"Martin: It's still got that nice contemporary sound. "
"Daphne: So, why don't you send it to old Blue Eyes? "
"Martin: No, they're just words scribbled on a piece of paper. The tune's in my head, I don't know how to write it down. "
"Frasier: Well, Niles and I do. You've got the tune in your head, why don't you let us write it down for you? "
"Daphne: Oh, you're wasting your breath trying to convince him to do something. "
"Frasier: Dad, come on. Yeah, you're probably right. You just sit there night after night watching TV until the time finally comes when we collect your ashes and scatter them over that chair - where they'll probably go unnoticed. "
"Martin: All right, okay. "
"Martin: Okay, so boys, the way I'm hearing the intro, it goes something like this. ' "
"Niles: Of course, it is your piano. "
"Martin: No, no, it "
"goes: Groovy lady of mine, ba-ba-ba-bap-bam-ba-a- aaa-a-a-a "
"Niles: "
"Like: "
"Martin: No, no, come on, this is the big finish. Ba-ba-bap-bam-ba-a- aaa-a-a-a "
"Frasier: Dad, dad, in Niles's defense, after four hours your 'ba-bap- ba-ba-a-a-a's sound a lot like your 'scoopety, boop, bop, bam' Right, Niles, let's just try it again. "
"Martin: Yeah That's it. "
"Niles: All right? "
"Martin: Yeah. Let's hear the chorus one last time. "
"sing: "
"Frasier: She's such a groovy lady, She makes my heart go heidi-hiedi, She is the chick I spend my nights dreaming off... "
"Frasier: Dad, I don't mean to criticise. You know that 'heidi-hiedi?' It sounds like Cab Calloway sung backwards. "
"Martin: You got any better suggestions? "
"Niles: Er, yes, "
"yes: 'She's like a wood, all cool and shady' "
"Frasier: No, "
"no: 'She makes the bravest cat go 'fraidy' "
"Daphne: I've got "
"it: 'She could have slept with Warren Beatty' "
"Frasier: Very nice Daphne, no. "
"Martin: Well, I'm sticking with my one, keep singing. "
"Frasier: Her lips are red as ruby, She makes my heart go scooby dooby, She is the broad who makes me coo-coo in the heart. "
"Niles: I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I don't mean to quibble but it seems like her heart is always going heidi-hiedi, ringy-dingy, or scooby dooby. "
"Martin: Look, I don't need another critic. "
"Niles: Fine, perhaps a cardiologist? "
"Martin: In all due respect, I think I'm a little more tuned in to what Frank likes and this is pretty close to perfect the way it is. "
"Frasier: Well? "
"Martin: How about that Thirty years and I've finally finished it. "
"Frasier: Never too late. "
"Martin: Yeah, first thing tomorrow, I'm mailing it to Frank's people. A little help from Lady Luck, maybe they'll kick it upstairs to the chairman himself. 'She's such a groovy lady, She makes my heart go heidi-hiedi...' "
"Martin: Oh Jeez The service is in an hour. Aren't you finished with that eulogy yet? "
"Frasier: I can't even come up with a first line. I got this old photo album, probably one of her pictures might inspire me. "
"Martin: How about "
"this: 'We all loved Aunt Louise, even if the camera didn't' "
"Daphne: Dr. Crane, you've been agonising over this for two weeks. Perhaps it's time to start bending the truth a little. "
"Frasier: No, I refuse to lie. "
"Martin: Why? "
"Daphne: I find it hard to believe there isn't one nice story you can tell about her. Maybe a cute little saying she used? "
"Frasier: I'm not sure that, 'Stop crying, or I'll give you something to cry about' would qualify. "
"Daphne: Where are you off to? "
"Martin: Just going to go check the mail. "
"Daphne: I wish they'd just give him an answer about that song. He must have made a hundred trips to the mailbox during the past two weeks. "
"Frasier: Oh, bless you, Daphne. Are you sure you're up to coming to the memorial? "
"Daphne: Oh, it's just a little cold. Besides, in my family, when there was a funeral everybody went. I remember when Grammy Moon passed on. My brothers had been off on a three-day bender. They couldn't even stand on their own - pissed as newts But they crawled to that chapel on their hands and knees. "
"Frasier: Very commendable. "
"Daphne: Yeah, well, they had an obligation. They were the pallbearers. "
"Niles: Hello, Daphne. "
"Daphne: Hello. "
"Frasier: Oh dear Lord, Niles, don't tell me you haven't disposed of those ashes yet. "
"Niles: Frasier, I have taken them to a dozen locations. Fossy glade, a babbling brook, a moonlit pond. None of them felt right, what am I going to do? "
"Frasier: Well, winter's coming. The sidewalks are always slippery. I'm having the same problem with the eulogy "
"Niles: Oh, remember when this photo was taken - the day Aunt Lousie took me to Wilson's Meadow to fly a kite? It cost her 35 cents and when it got stuck in a tree she made me climb up after it. I fell out, broke my collarbone in two places. I think that's the only time I saw her laugh. Frasier I think she might be happy there "
"Frasier: Niles, I think you might be right. "
"Niles: And even if she's not, let's still do it. "
"Daphne: Any news about your song? "
"Martin: Nah. Listen, we better get started. "
"Frasier: All right. Perhaps I'll have some inspiration on the way over in the car. "
"Niles: And Wilson's Meadow is on the way. We can stop and scatter the ashes. "
"Frasier: Fine. "
"Daphne: Well, this sounds like a family affair. Maybe I'll take my car and meet you there. "
"Martin: All right, let's go. "
"Niles: Wilson's Meadow is the perfect place. Aunt Louise, you've tormented me for two weeks and finally I've shown you I can do something right. "
"Niles: Oh, shut up "
"TO: "
"Niles: Here, here, yes, yes. Perfect. There's something rattling in here. Like some great grisly morata. "
"Frasier: What am I going to say at this memorial? "
"Martin: Don't ask me. "
"Frasier: You write lyrics, don't ya? "
"Martin: Right Tell that to Sinatra "
"Frasier: Oh, dad, it's a good sing. I even caught myself singing it in the shower this morning. "
"Martin: Yeah. "
"Frasier: Just because you haven't heard anything yet doesn't mean... you have heard something? "
"Martin: Yeah. This morning they rejected it. "
"Frasier: Oh, I'm sorry, dad. "
"Martin: Oh, it's okay. Sinatra must gets thousands of songs sent to him. What did I expect? "
"Frasier: Well, you know, at least you gave it your best shot. "
"Martin: Yeah, I guess. I mean, sure it would have been nice to hear it sung, but hey, I finished it, finally Yeah, I walked down that highway, and climbed that mountain, and reached for the stars. Oh sure, now I get hot "
"Niles: I can't open the damn urn "
"Frasier: Oh, you are so helpless For Pete's sake, give it to me, give it to me. "
"TO: "
"Martin: It looks like Louise's whole rest home showed up. It must be 'Liver & Onions Day' in the cafeteria. "
"Daphne: Apparently when they heard it was Frasier Crane from the radio speaking, the whole rest home turned out. Can't wait to hear what he has to say. "
"Niles: Neither can "
"he: He's huddled in the rectory still working on his first sentence. "
"Daphne: How did the scattering go? Were there any problems? "
"Niles: No, nothing important. "
"Minister: Dear friends, thank you all for coming today. I know how very deeply your friendship was treasured by Louise. We are privileged to have with us her favourite nephew, one of Seattle's most eloquent speakers, Dr. Frasier Crane. Dr. Crane has spent the last fortnight reflecting on what Louise meant to him. Dr. Crane? "
"Frasier: Well, well, well. What can I say about Aunt Louise? What can I say? Louise... touched us all. In fact, she touches us still. Aunt Louise... loved to teach us all lessons. You know, it's hard to picture her without hearing her saying, 'I'm going to teach you a lesson.' What particularly comes to mind, by the very way she lived her own "
"life: she taught us how important it is to pursue our dreams. Whether we succeed or fail, what really matters is that we tried. And now as we say goodbye to Louise, a phrase comes to mind. It was coined by my very own father... 'She's Such A Groovy Lady.' "
"Frasier: I said, 'She's Such A Groovy Lady.' "
"stands: "
"Choir: Oh, that groovy lady, Oh, that groovy lady... "
"Choir: She's such a groovy lady, She makes my heart go heidi-hiedi, She is the chick I spend my nights dreaming of. Her lips are red as ruby, She makes my heart go scooby dooby, She makes me wanna shout 'Hey Vagers, above' She's got the whole world swinging, She makes my heart start ringing-dinging, That hubba hubba groovy lady of mine, Of mine, of mine, That hubba hubba groovy lady of mine, Oh yeah, Oh yeah... "
"Base: Yeah "
"Choir: Yeah "

"Frasier: Hello, Niles. "
"Niles: Frasier, quick, give me your museum membership card. "
"Frasier: What for? "
"Niles: I just heard tickets go on sale today for the exhibit of fourteenth century Japanese netsuki figurines. "
"Frasier: Oh, then the rumours were true? "
"Niles: Hurry, hurry, I want to get there before the line forms. "
"Roz: Five seconds. "
"Frasier: Oh, just give me a minute, Niles. Just sit tight, huh? And we're back. Before we take our last call, I'd like to remind you that Mercy Hospital will be conducting free blood pressure testing this Saturday on Whidbey Island. "
"Frasier: Hypertension leads to strokes, heart disease and other maladies, so we should all be on the lookout for symptoms like shortness of breath, quickening of pulse, irritability- Oh, will you just shove the damn thing into your mouth - So let's all join together to help defeat this silent killer. "
"Frasier: Roz, who is on the line? "
"Roz: On line four we have Mac, who's recently moved here from Australia and he's having a problem with a co-worker. "
"Frasier: Hello, Mac, welcome to Seattle, I'm listening. "
"Mac: Well, mate, it like your Shelia said. I'm working with a real yob-out. He goes on and on about things nobody gives a billabong about just to show off how smart he is. "
"Frasier: Well, you have my sympathy. There's nothing more irritating than pointless and pretentious erudition. My advice to you is to simply avoid him, is that possible? "
"Mac: Not really, you bloody wallaby "
"Bulldog: You're on right before me Stay tuned for the Bulldog. "
"Frasier: Well, that's one on me, or rather one on me and my call screener, Roz, whose ancestors were once heard remarking, 'Oh, what a nice wooden horse, of course I'll sign for it.' This is Dr. Frasier Crane wishing you good mental health. "
"Bulldog: Gotcha "
"Frasier: How many times have I asked you to desist with your adolescent antics? "
"Bulldog: I've got a sense of humour "
"Frasier: I mean it, I'll go over your head "
"Bulldog: Stop it, you're scaring me "
"Roz: Listen, you sleazy little lyme tick, you do that one more time and I'll cut you off. And I don't mean mid-sentence "
"Bulldog: Stop it, you're scaring me "
"Frasier: Do you believe these hijinks I have to put up with? "
"Niles: No. Who would have thought it with a station whose current motto is, 'Yakkety-Yak, We Talk Back'? "
"Frasier: Oh, run along. "
"Kate: Oh, hello, Dr. Crane. "
"Frasier: Miss Costas, I'd like you to meet my brother, Dr. Niles Crane. "
"Kate: How do you do? "
"Niles: Enchanté, I'd love to stay and chat but I'm off to get tickets for Frasier and me at the Japanese netsuki exhibit. "
"Kate: You'll love it. I saw it in Kyoto. It's just such a shame they're not letting the really rare pieces out of the country. "
"Niles: As my Japanese gardener says, Maimoshi chikosho. "
"Kate: Watch your mouth "
"Niles: Oh, you speak Japanese? Oh, I'll just retreat so that I can be one with my humiliation. "
"Frasier: Oh Kate, can I have a word with you? "
"Kate: I'm in kind of a hurry. "
"Frasier: Yes, well, it'll just take a moment. "
"Kate: I seriously doubt that, but go ahead. "
"Frasier: Yes, I've tried dealing with this problem on my own but Bulldog insists on interrupting my show with his foolish pranks. "
"Kate: I heard. "
"Frasier: Yes, well I did not spend eight gruelling years at Harvard to be mocked by that juvenile jackass "
"Kate: Shameless "
"Frasier: Oh, he's beyond shameless "
"Kate: I'm talking about the way you manage to get Harvard into every conversation. "
"Frasier: Well, I'm sure you'll mention your alma mater too some day - when it's credited "
"Kate: Gee, you sure know how to ask for help "
"Frasier: No, I'm sorry. "
"Kate: I know, I'll take care of it. "
"Frasier: Just make sure he understands that... "
"Kate: "
"Jack: Hey, the key to this game is the husky secondary. "
"Bulldog: Jack, how can I put this to you delicately? You're a moron Shut up You know squat You know less than squat You and squat could go to the movies and squat could wear an 'I'm With Stupid' T-Shirt "
"Jack: You're awesome, Bulldog. Way to nail a blow on Dr. Crane You are the greatest "
"Bulldog: Yeah, whatever, shut up. Now, look, all you guys sending in any postcards to win tickets to the SeaHawks game - do I need another picture of the Space Needle? We'll be back right after this. Hey, what I just said, I'm sorry. I meant to say women in thongs. "
"Kate: Stop busting Frasier's chops, enough said? "
"Bulldog: Well I could, but see all these lines lit up? They're all waiting to tell me how funny it was. "
"Kate: Are all these callers waiting to tell Bulldog how much they liked the joke he played on Frasier? "
"Pete: All except the guy on nine, he thinks Bulldog sucks. "
"Kate: Because of what he did to Frasier? "
"Pete: No, just in general. "
"Bulldog: So, what do you want me to do? "
"Kate: If you think I'm going to allow you to publicly mock one of our most respected hosts on air just for the sake of higher ratings, you and I are going to get along just fine "
"Daphne: Come on, Eddie, you love paté. And this is the good stuff. Uh-oh. "
"Frasier: Two syllables every homeowner loves to hear upon entering the door. Would that have anything to do with the fact that you're feeding my imported foie gras to a dog? "
"Daphne: Well, I'm sorry, but it calms him during the thunder. "
"Frasier: Oh, well, heaven forbid that Eddie should ever work a nerve When Niles gets here we'll have sherry and snausages "
"Daphne: That reminds me, Dr. Crane will be a bit late. Your father asked him to stop at the vet and pick up some pills for Eddie. "
"Frasier: I'm the one who's had a hard day. How come no one ever brings me tranquilizers? "
"Daphne: I've often wondered that myself. "
"Frasier: Hello? "
"Bulldog: Hello, this is Dr. Julius Irving. I'm calling for Dr. Niles Crane, his receptionist said he might be there. "
"Frasier: I'm sorry, I am expecting him if you'd like to leave a message. "
"Bulldog: No, no, nothing important. Some of the boys here at the club have a little bet going about 'The Mikado.' "
"Frasier: Well, perhaps I can help. I'm Niles's brother, Dr. Frasier Crane, and as luck would have it I was in an all-male version of 'The Mikado' at Oxford. People still ask to see my Yum- Yum. "
"Bulldog: I don't suppose you happen to remember the words to 'Three Little Maids'? "
"Frasier: Well, let me see. Well, of course my falsetto isn't what it used to be but, um... 'Three little maids from school are we, prim as a school girl well may be, filled to the brim with girlish glee, three little maids from school' "
"Frasier: Dad, would you please be quiet? I'm trying to settle a bet here. "
"Martin: You sure are Some caller bet Bulldog he couldn't make you sing over the air. "
"Bulldog: "
"Frasier: Well, Dad, I'm glad to see that you're amused, having your own son humiliated publicly. "
"Martin: Oh, come on, it's funny. He makes everybody look stupid - the guys in the newsroom, Chopper Dave... "
"Frasier: That is not exactly a miracle transformation when it comes to Chopper Dave, a man whose life work consists of looking down at the freeway and saying, 'Crowded'; 'Not Crowded.' "
"Martin: Where are you going? "
"Frasier: To the station "
"Martin: Oh, come on, Frasier, don't take it all so seriously. You know, we played jokes like this all the time when I was on the force. The day they replaced my bulletproof vest with a big lacy bra, I knew I was one of the guys. "
"Frasier: Thank you, Dad. That also clears up a question that's troubled me for years concerning the night you were shot "
"TO: "
"Bulldog: The 'Salmon' that's what you want to name our expansion hockey team, 'The Seattle Salmon'? Why don't you take your two IQ points, rub them together, see if you can't start a fire, beat it Hey, you're in the doghouse "
"Caller: Hey, am I on? "
"Bulldog: Yes, take as long as you want Next. "
"Rob: Hey, Bulldog, you're the man. How about we name them 'The Bulldogs'? "
"Bulldog: Hey, you want to suck up? Send money "
"Rob: Wait, wait, wait, wait, I got another one. [Frasier enters with a menacing eye] What about 'The Lizards'? "
"Bulldog: I hate lizards, they're disgusting. They make my skin crawl. You're an idiot and you don't deserve to live "
"Rob: You're the best, Bulldog "
"Bulldog: Shut up Back in thirty "
"Frasier: I warned you. "
"Bulldog: Hey, hey, clear your jets. Kate told me to keep busting ya'. Said it's good for ratings. You got a beef, take it up with her "
"Frasier: I don't believe you. "
"Bulldog: Pete, what did Kate say? "
"Pete: She said you're a pig. "
"Bulldog: No, before that "
"Pete: She said keep raggin' on the doc' "
"TO: "
"Frasier: I want to talk to Kate now "
"Susan: She's not in. "
"Frasier: Oh, very clever, 'she's not in.' Like that'll make me go away "
"to: Kate's Office "
"Frasier: She's not in "
"Kate: I need a copy of our contract with Nanette Stewart. What's Yum-Yum doing here? It's all right, I can guess. "
"Frasier: You promised you'd put an end to Bulldog's shenanigans and instead you encouraged him. [notices Kate has pulled Nanette's name from the board] You're cancelling 'Pet Chat With Nanette'? She's been on for six years. "
"Kate: Yeah, but she's been floating at the top of the bowl for the last two. When I went in to talk to Bulldog, the phones were lit up like Times Square; his fans love it when he zaps you. "
"to: Foyer "
"Frasier: So, you would have me ridiculed for the sake of those hyenas "
"Kate: No, I would have you fight back. He makes pot shots at you, you come back at him in your droll, Ivy League, 'look at me, I've got a thesaurus' kind of way It'll be funny "
"Frasier: Funny? Funny? "
"to: Hallway "
"Frasier: I refuse to engage in a battle of wits with a man who's favourite t-shirt reads 'Seattle Hooter Inspector' "
"Kate: Afraid of the competition? "
"Frasier: I am a doctor, I went... ...to medical school I will not embarrass myself by engaging in a grab for ratings. "
"Kate: You just announced to a half a million listeners that you are 'filled to the brim with girlish glee.' I think the H.M.S Pinafore of embarrassment has sailed Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to fire someone. "
"Kate: Oh, God, she brought Spanky "
"Frasier: Kate, this is not over "
"Kate: Do you know what your problem is? You have no sense of humour. "
"Frasier: I am sick and tired of people telling me that "
"Kate: Well, then, lighten up. "
"Bulldog: I asked the Raiders' defensive line to describe their tackling skills and here's what they said. "
"Frasier: Three little maids from school are we, three little maids from school "
"Niles: Good evening, Daphne. "
"Daphne: Evening, Dr. Crane. Did you bring Eddie's pills? "
"Niles: Yes, and the vet gave very specific instructions. [takes them out and reads] 'Take one tablet per hour or as needed until trembling subsides.' I'm sorry, these are for Maris. Those are for Eddie, here you go. "
"Daphne: I'll just hide his pill in a bit of food. Like our Grammy Moon used to get grandad to take his heart medicine. "
"Niles: If he had heart problems, why wouldn't he want to take his medicine? "
"Daphne: Don't think that nosy coroner didn't ask the same question Num-nums, Eddie. "
"Daphne: Oh, he's a good boy. Normally I don't believe in popping pills for every little upset. "
"Niles: I quite agree My nerves are bothered by this constant thundering, too, but I would never turn to drugs to calm down. Oh, mommy "
"Martin: Hey Niles, you're not going to believe what happened to Frasier. "
"Niles: Oh, I heard the whole thing. "
"Martin: You listen to Bulldog's program? "
"Niles: Yes, Dad, I can't sleep nights till I find out who hurled what ball through what apparatus. No, no, no, no, it was on at the vet's. "
"Frasier: You would think that in a city with this much rain that people would develop an etiquette about it, but no They buy umbrellas that are too big for them, you have to walk into the street to get around them and then they drive too close to the curb so that you're sure to get splashed And they wear brown shoes with white socks "
"Daphne: What has that got to do with the rain? "
"Frasier: Nothing But I mean, really, get a fashion sense "
"Martin: Well, I guess things didn't go too well at the station, huh? "
"Frasier: No, they didn't. "
"Martin: What happened? "
"Frasier: It turned out the station manager is encouraging Bulldog's little pranks. Now she wants me to return his fire on the air. Well, I thought the idea was absurd at first but now I'm starting to warm to it. "
"Niles: I say have at him He's grossly overmatched but he did bring this on himself. "
"Frasier: You know, you're right, Niles. If I have to fight cheap and dirty on his own turf, then I will "
"Martin: Uhhhh... "
"Frasier: And what is that supposed to mean? "
"Martin: Well, I don't think it's a good idea. You know, Bulldog's pretty good at this kind of thing. He's a funny guy. "
"Frasier: And, I'm not funny? "
"Martin: Uhhhh... "
"Frasier: I don't believe this "
"Niles: Well, now, obviously Dad's forgetting the time you took the names of our wine club board and turned them all into wickedly derisive anagrams "
"Frasier: Now, you see, dad, I made you laugh. "
"Martin: No, I'm looking at Eddie. "
"Daphne: I guess he won't be needing a second pill "
"Martin: Now, now, Frasier, don't get me wrong. I think you're witty, you're clever, but funny's different. Funny's somebody who makes you laugh with your belly. Now, Bulldog's funny. Duke's cousin, Louie, now he's really funny He's like Jackie Gleason, only loud He makes you laugh so hard the beer comes out of your nose. "
"Daphne: You know what feels good through the nose? A warm cup of cocoa. I just may go home for Christmas this year. "
"Frasier: You know, just because I haven't caused anyone to blow beer through their nostrils doesn't mean that I can't. Anyone who can compose a clever ballad can certainly master the intricacies of the whoopee cushion "
"Martin: Well, I wouldn't be too sure about that. It's a lot harder than you think. "
"Frasier: All right, you just tune into Bulldog's show tomorrow. Pop open a beer and prepare for a Budweiser geyser "
"Niles: You know, Frasier, if you're serious about that whoopee cushion, I happen to have one at the house. [they all stare at him] Last year a disgruntled servant left one on Maris's dining room chair. Fortunately for all of us, embarrassment was averted when my little faun proved too light to activate it. "
"Bulldog: Well, it's six-thirty, sports fans. That means it's time for... Our big SeaHawks tickets giveaway. Yes, my curvaceous and bodacious assistant Darlene is rolling in our glittery giant prize draw right now. ' "
"Bulldog: Okay, Darlene, give it a good crank. Whoa Honey, I meant the drum "
"Frasier: Here it comes, Roz, the hilarity ensues "
"Roz: Okay, explain this to me one more time. You were the one who's trying to prove to everyone you're so funny, so why am I the one who had to put the lizard in the box? "
"Frasier: It was just as difficult to be the lookout Stop whining "
"Bulldog: Hey, look who's here. It's our new boss lady, KACL's own Kate Costas "
"Roz: Kate's there? Oh, Frasier, Kate's there "
"Frasier: No, no, it's even better. Even better that she will be an eyewitness to my little jape "
"Bulldog: Come in, Kate. Yeah, here we go, glad you dropped in. "
"Kate: Hello, Bulldog. Hi, Darlene. Wow, look at that mighty drum "
"Bulldog: Yeah, give it a good spin Look at those cards going round and round. Okay, Seattle... and the winner is... "
"Bulldog: Hey, Kate, why don't you pick it? "
"Kate: Okay. And the lucky winner is... YEOW "
"Kate: Something bit me "
"Bulldog: Oh my God It's a lizard "
"Kate: There it goes, there it goes, there it goes "
"Kate: Stop that lizard, it has my finger "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Roz Any news? "
"Roz: Oh, yeah. They sewed her fingertip back on. She's gonna be fine. Frasier, would you wipe that guilty look off your face? No-one even suspects you. "
"Frasier: Why not? "
"Roz: Because you made such a big deal about how playing pranks was beneath you "
"Frasier: Oh, they're not only beneath me, they're beyond me. I'm going to accept my limitations, and be satisfied to merely be witty and urbane. Even my most barbed comments never drew blood Oh God, I feel sick. "
"Roz: You do? When the lizard threw up her fingertip, who had to pack it in frozen yogurt and rush it down here? "
"Frasier: I'm going to tell her the truth. "
"Roz: What? Are you insane? "
"Frasier: I've got to unburden myself. "
"Roz: Frasier, you didn't start this. You are the victim here, why should you have to suffer any more than you already have? "
"Frasier: I'll keep your name out of it "
"Roz: Fine, do what you want. "
"to: Kate's Room "
"Kate: I don't know when I'll be back in the office, Susan, just cancel all my appointments. Is there any word on who pulled this stupid stunt? I don't want excuses, I want names Will you hurry up that shot, I'm in agony here. "
"Frasier: Kate, I see that your strength is back. I brought you some flowers. "
"Kate: What kind of raving psychotic would do a thing like this? "
"Frasier: You know, people use that word 'psychotic' an awful lot these days. A kid steals a candy bar, suddenly he's a psychotic. "
"Kate: I'm gonna find him and I'm gonna crush him "
"Frasier: Are you sure that's enough? Make sure that all goes in "
"Nurse: Call me if you need anything. "
"Frasier: Well, Kate, I came here for a reason. "
"Kate: Oh, let me guess, someone park in your space? "
"Frasier: No, but if someone had, I would have forgiven him, just as I'm sure you will forgive... "
"Kate: Who? "
"Frasier: Well, I'm sure the poor misguided prankster that perpetrated this evil deed really had no ill will in mind. It wasn't his... or her... You know, that Nanette from 'Pet Chat,' she had a real axe to grind "
"Frasier: What? "
"Kate: What? "
"Frasier: You giggled. "
"Kate: Oh, it was kinda funny. "
"Frasier: What? "
"Kate: What? "
"Frasier: What's funny? "
"Kate: Oh, I was just remembering... "
"Frasier: What? "
"Kate: "
"Frasier: Oh, oh, the shot's kicking in, isn't it? "
"Kate: Wouldn't you know, it bites my middle finger. How am I supposed to drive? "
"Frasier: You know, Kate, maybe now would be a good time... "
"Kate: Now you know, life is so funny. One minute, you're standing in a hallway, the next minute you're a poo-poo platter for a lizard. That's a funny word, isn't it? Hallway "
"Frasier: You want to hear something really funny? "
"Kate: And Bulldog, Bulldog's... Oh, see, now, you're starting to get tired, I should go. "
"Frasier: Kate, Kate, before you go to sleep, there's just one last funny thing I want to tell you... "
"Kate: O-kay "
"Frasier: I put the lizard in the box. "
"Kate: O-kay. "
"Frasier: Oh, God It's alive "
"Kate: You what? "
"Frasier: Well, I, it was meant for Bulldog. It was all an accident, I never intended to... "
"Frasier: Kate? Kate? "
"UP: Like a cobra striking, Kate's hand snatches his wrist- "
"TO: Waiting Room "
"screams: "
"Frasier: NURSE "

"Frasier: Roz, who's our last caller? "
"Roz: On line two we have Marilyn. She's feeling a little homesick. "
"Frasier: Go ahead, Marilyn. "
"Marilyn: Well, I like living in Seattle but, I don't know, I grew up in this little town in Wisconsin and I really miss that life. "
"Frasier: Well, you're not the only one. My producer Roz has regaled me with many stories of the great Dairy State. "
"Marilyn: You're from Wisconsin, Roz? What part? "
"Roz: Bloomer. "
"Marilyn: Oh my God, I'm from Monomeney. "
"Roz: No way You're from Menomonie? My cousins are from Menomonie, do you know the Rayburns? "
"Marilyn: Billy Rayburn is your cousin? I used to work with him at Bell's Frozen Custard "
"Frasier: Of course she did. "
"Roz: Do you remember that guy that used the run the store, with all the moles? "
"Marilyn: Mr. Sneedy. "
"Frasier: Ladies, as fascinating as this is, I'm afraid we're out of time. "
"Marilyn: Oh "
"Roz: That's okay, Marilyn, you can call back tomorrow. "
"Frasier: Make sure you all tune in tomorrow for Part 2 in our series, 'Women of the Cheese Belt.' Goodbye for now, and good mental health. "
"Roz: These messages came for you earlier, your wines are ready. "
"Frasier: Oh, excellent. I'm hosting a tasting tonight for the wine club Niles and I belong to. I'm hoping they name me the Maitre d'Chai. It's a long-standing dream of mine to wear that silver cup around my neck. "
"Roz: You know, back in Wisconsin if a guy wore a cup around his neck it meant he'd ticked off the gym teacher. "
"Frasier: Fine Make sport, but this does happen to be important to me. "
"Roz: Since when? You used to say that club was nothing but a bunch of arrogant cork-sniffing snobs. "
"Frasier: Well, that was before I got in. "
"Roz: Well, when I'm handing out baloney sandwiches this weekend at the homeless shelter, it will do me heart good to know that a bunch of wealthy men are swishing two-hundred-dollar bottles of wine and spitting it into silver buckets "
"Frasier: It's not like we don't recycle the bottles. "
"Frasier: Big, full-bodied, nicely baked. Essence of truffles, long finish - Chambertin 76'. "
"Niles: Bravo, Frasier. If only your aim were as accurate. "
"Daphne: How is it those same taste buds can't tell the difference between my pot roast and my flank steak? "
"Frasier: Well, considering you learned to cook in England, it's a wonder I can't tell your flank steak from a braised tennis ball. "
"Niles: Now, now, let's move on to the number seven. "
"Frasier: Ah, touch of oak. Hint of currant. Whisper of.... "
"Frasier: ...what is that, what is that? Oh yes, wet dog "
"Martin: You guys still playing that stupid game? "
"Frasier: Dad, wine tasting is not a stupid game - it's a highly refined skill. "
"Martin: Yeah, I just saw a couple of guys on the corner practising out of paper bags. "
"Niles: We're hardly winos. Some very distinguished people belong to our "
"club: the mayor, the commissioner of public safety, the chief of surgery at St. Lukes... "
"Daphne: Oh, just the people I want walking around all liquored up. Could you find room for a school bus driver and a couple of air traffic controllers? "
"Frasier: Well, we would if they had impeccable taste. Which reminds me dad, I have a favour to beg. Would you mind if I moved your chair into your room until after the tasting? "
"Martin: Forget it, you might as well ask me to stay in my room. "
"Niles: Which takes care of the second favour. "
"Martin: Oh, all right, move it. At least I don't have to spend the night watching your society pals getting tanked. "
"Frasier: Okay, Niles, grab an end. "
"Niles: Oh, you're serious. You know I don't lift. "
"Frasier: Yes, with that stick where it is I'm surprised you can bend. Start hoisting, come on. "
"Frasier: Look what you've done "
"Martin: You better be talking about the floor. "
"Frasier: Oh, of course I'm talking about the floor... "
"Martin: Oh, for Pete's sake, it's just a little scratch. Get me a yellow magic marker. I'll color it in, no one'll know the difference. "
"Frasier: Dad, you have no idea how critical these people can "
"be: they love finding fault. "
"Daphne: We could put a rug over it. "
"Frasier: A rug? Where a rug doesn't belong? Why don't you just throw down a Twister mat, have a few rounds between vintages? "
"Niles: Steady Frasier, there's still hope. I'll bring my contractor by in the morning. The man's a genius. "
"Martin: You know, it's time you guys learned, everything doesn't have to be perfect. "
"Frasier: Yes, it's that kind of advice that leads to shag carpeting "
"Frasier: Ah, good morning Daphne - extra pancakes for me this morning I'm famished "
"Daphne: Yes, well you should have thought about that last night before you started making cracks about English cooking. I have hung up my spatula. "
"Martin: Well, you moved my chair, you cut off my pancake supply; why don't you just back out over Eddie on your way to work and make it a hat trick? "
"Frasier: And a hat trick would be? "
"Martin: It's in hockey where one player... "
"Frasier: Enough said, thank you. "
"Niles: Good morning, Frasier. I'm delivering one miracle worker as promised. Joe DeCarlo, Frasier Crane. "
"Frasier: Pleasure. "
"Niles: And my father, Martin Crane. "
"Martin: Hi, Joe. "
"Joe: Where's the scratch? "
"Martin: Oh, you mean you didn't see it? We were going to put some orange cones around it so nobody would fall in it "
"Frasier: It's right here. "
"Joe: I can get rid of that. "
"Frasier: It has to be done by five. My guests arrive at seven, so it has to be a firm five. Not a five-fifteen or a five-thirty. "
"Joe: I'll be done by noon. "
"Frasier: Splendid. "
"Niles: I told you he was good. We're talking about a man who has satisfied Maris. Something that's still regrettably on my to-do list "
"Daphne: Coffee's ready. Of course, I'm sure it'll taste like my old bath water to you. You know, how it gets all grey and scummy around the edges with little flecks of... oh, hello. "
"Joe: Hi. "
"Daphne: Hello. "
"Niles: I'd love some coffee, Daphne. Hmm, Daphne? "
"Martin: Er, Daph', this is Joe DeCarlo. Joe, this is Daphne - she helps me out around here. "
"Joe: Smells great. Columbian? "
"Daphne: The coffee - Costa Rican. Would you like a cup? "
"Joe: Thanks. "
"Daphne: I'll be right back. He's adorable, talk me up. "
"Martin: A plate of pancakes. "
"Daphne: Deal. "
"Martin: You know, Joe, Daphne's a great gal. You know, she doesn't always go round in that ratty old bathrobe. She cleans up real cute. "
"Joe: You don't have to convince me. "
"Niles: You know, I think dad's right - you don't need to fix that scratch, it adds character. Come, Joe. "
"Frasier: Niles, forget it "
"Daphne: Honeybun? "
"Joe: Yes. "
"Daphne: Hee hee, I meant would you like one of these with your coffee? "
"Joe: Oh, I'd love one. "
"Daphne: Anything...? "
"Joe: No. Sugar? "
"Daphne: Yes. "
"Joe: I meant in the coffee. "
"Niles: You know, Maris is quite keen on gutting my library to make more space for her hats. Why don't you come home with me and you can send one of your men over to do this little job. Bruce would be good - the large sweaty gentleman with the chili dogs on his breath. "
"Frasier: Niles, Joe is here already and we do have a deadline. "
"Niles: But, don't you think it would be prudent... "
"Frasier: Niles, it's settled. "
"Joe: That's great, because I'm kinda anxious to get at her. [goes upstage] "
"Niles: I'll just bet he is, the testosterone is just dripping... "
"Frasier: Niles, Niles, he's talking about the scratch. "
"Niles: I knew that Only I know that I mean, watch him "
"Frasier: Someone remodelling? "
"Electrician: No, bad wiring in one of the condos. "
"Frasier: Ah, well I hope you won't be here this evening. I'm entertaining some very important guests and you know how sound travels in this building. "
"Painter: Ah, can't make any promises. We're here as long as this poor sap is willing to pay us. "
"TO: Hallway Outside Frasier's Apartment. "
"TO: Frasier's Apartment. "
"Frasier: What is happening? "
"Joe: Hold on, guys. Er, sorry about this, Dr. Crane, but I plugged in the sander to start on the floor, you blew a circuit. "
"Frasier: So naturally you're sawing a hole into my wall. "
"Joe: The circuit blew - it started a fire. You've got some real bad wiring in here. "
"Frasier: But how long? "
"Joe: A couple of hours. "
"Frasier: 'A couple' is vague. That would mean the big hand would be on the twelve and the little hand would be...? "
"Joe: On the four. "
"Frasier: On the four? Oh, the four is okay, fine. "
"Martin: You know the fire, Eddie smelled it first. "
"Frasier: Oh, well he's a regular canary in a coal mine, isn't he "
"Niles: My God, what's going on? "
"Frasier: Don't ask, Niles. Oh, I see you've got the Romani Containe. "
"Niles: Yes, but unfortunately they only had the one bottle. "
"Frasier: That's funny, the importer told me he had two. "
"Niles: Really? How strange. "
"Frasier: You know, if I didn't know you better I would swear you had squirreled one away for yourself. But then we both know that you must be telling the truth, because you're such a slave to your ethics that even the slightest transgression would cause your nose to bleed. "
"Niles: Which it isn't "
"Frasier: You just sniffed. "
"Niles: I didn't sniff, it was a snort of contempt. "
"Frasier: A snort is out, that was in. "
"Niles: Oh, alright - the other bottle's in the car in my bowling bag. "
"Frasier: Thank you. You have a bowling bag? "
"Niles: Yes. Maris and I have taken to giving each other gag gifts. I gave her a cook book. "
"Daphne: Oh, yoohoo. I noticed how your shirt was [knees turning to "
"jelly:] clinging to your back and... I thought a nice cup of iced tea might hit the spot. "
"Joe: Thanks, Daph'. "
"Daphne: Ho-ho, I got a spark. "
"Joe: Me, too. "
"Niles: That's just static electricity from the carpet - it can happen to anyone. I'll show you. "
"Frasier: STOP POKING ME "
"Daphne: Should I put these little fingery foods for tonight in the fridge? "
"Frasier: Oh, yes please - the Brie is sweating up a storm. "
"Joe: Let me help you with those. "
"Niles: No Daphne, let me help you. "
"Niles: Spark Spark "
"workmen: "
"Frasier: I will be back after work at five-thirty - I hope I have your word that my apartment will be perfect for then. "
"Joe: Okay. "
"Frasier: Alright, think think before you answer. This is not like marriage vows, or a promise to a dying parent. This really, really counts. "
"Joe: You have my word. "
"Frasier: Thank you. "
"Bruce: God, I'm sweating like a pig. I've got to air myself out. Hey, hold the elevator, will ya? "
"Frasier: I'm sorry, I need this nose tonight, thank you. "
"Niles: You don't have to keep feeding these men. Actually, Maris finds they work faster if you keep them hungry. "
"Daphne: Hee hee, I don't mind. Of course, I probably don't cook as well as their wives or girlfriends. That is, if they all have girlfriends. I'm sure Joe's probably mentioned some girl to you. "
"Niles: No. "
"Daphne: Really? "
"Niles: That is... not any one girl. Not old 'love'em and leave'em' Joe. From what I've heard, he's wrecked more homes than he's fixed. Mimsie Stanshope has him over all the time, and I don't just mean to strip her entryway. "
"Daphne: Oh, I see. "
"Niles: I'm sorry, Daphne. "
"Daphne: No, it's better I should know now before I get my hopes up. Thank you for being honest with me. "
"Time: 12"
":20) "
"Frasier: Joe... "
"Joe: Dr. Crane, don't panic, I can explain everything. "
"Frasier: Wonderful. Perhaps you can explain [points to man on "
"scaffolding:] these legs. "
"Joe: That's Cecil. He's the best ceiling guy in Seattle. We were lucky to get him. When we opened up the wall to get to the faulty wiring, we found that the gas pipes leading to your fireplace were cracked. Had to be fixed. "
"Frasier: Tonight? "
"Martin: I OK'd it. It just seemed wiser to do it before the explosion. "
"Niles: Frasier, the club members arrive in forty-five minutes. Have you lost your... Cecil "
"Frasier: Niles, don't yell at me. If you were able to lift anything heavier than an emory board we wouldn't be in this position. "
"Martin: Maybe next time you'll listen to your old man. "
"Frasier: Thank you, dad. You know, I was just considering whether I should go shave or slit my wrists. You made my choice a little easier. "
"Joe: Don't worry, we are gonna make it. Only... about that shaving. We had to shut the water off to replace a valve. "
"Frasier: Oh, well, that explosion idea's sounding better and better. Could someone at least move that mantle piece away from the door Just hold on, will you? "
"Martin: Hey Joe, you know you're going to be through by seven? It gives you plenty of time for [points at Daphne who has now "
"entered:] a dinner and a movie. "
"erupts: "
"Daphne: I said I don't want to go out with you "
"Joe: Whatcha looking at? Get back to work Thanks a lot "
"Martin: Why would she do that? She's crazy about him "
"Martin: Niles, is your nose bleeding? "
"Niles: No, no, I was just admiring Cecil's handiwork. "
"Frasier: That was the mayor on the phone. Apparently his wife can't make it tonight so he has invited Senator Adler Can anything else possibly go wrong? "
"Martin: Take a look at that. "
"Frasier: Oh, dear God. Is that blood on my floor? [walks along a "
"trail:] And another drop. "
"Frasier: Niles "
"TO: Powder Room "
"Frasier: Well? "
"Niles: Is it terribly wrong to mislead someone even if it is for his or her own good? "
"Frasier: What did you tell Daphne? "
"Niles: I made up a story that Joe seduces all the women he works for so she wouldn't go out with him. "
"Frasier: Oh Niles, how could you be so selfish? "
"Niles: I didn't do it for me, I did it for her. She deserves a doctor, or a lawyer - someone for whom a T-shirt is an undergarment. "
"Frasier: Look, I don't know what sort of twisted fantasy you've concocted about you and Daphne. I suppose it involves a comet hitting the earth and you and she having to rebuild the species But trust me, Niles, it is not going to happen. She needs a man - one who can do more for her than just smell her hair. "
"Frasier: Daphne "
"Niles: What are you going to do? "
"Frasier: You are going to fix this. "
"Niles: What am I going to tell her? "
"Frasier: Tell her the truth. Only the truth shall make you clot. "
"Daphne: Yes, Dr. Crane? "
"Frasier: Yes Daphne, er, Niles has something he wishes to discuss with you. "
"Daphne: What is it, Dr. Crane? Oh look, you have a spot on your tie. "
"Niles: Well, earlier, what I said about Joe - I made a mistake. He doesn't sleep around, he hasn't wrecked any homes, and the business about Mimsie Stanshope... "
"Bruce: Oh sorry, is there a john around here to air out my paddle? "
"Niles: You can use the master bedroom. Joe never worked for Mimsie Stanshoe.. "
"Bruce: He sure didn't. I do all the work at Mimsie's. She is one tough lady to satisfy. "
"Daphne: It's you? "
"Bruce: I'm the only guy that can make her happy, everyone knows that. Jeez. "
"Daphne: So, that was the mistake you heard. Those stories you heard weren't about Joe, they were about Bruce? "
"Niles: Hard to believe, isn't it? But you know, when society women go slumming they go all the way So, you can tell Joe that you've changed your mind about going out with him. "
"Daphne: Oh no, I couldn't. What would I say? "
"Niles: Just tell him the truth. Tell him that I heard stories that he... No, bad idea Here. You... wait here. "
"Niles: Joe. "
"Joe: Yep? "
"Niles: You have to ask Daphne out again. "
"Joe: Are you nuts? You heard what she said. "
"Niles: Yes, but if you ask her again; she'll say yes. "
"Joe: Hey, maybe I've changed my mind. "
"Niles: Oh no, you haven't changed your mind. You're just letting masculine vanity and hurt feelings keep you from something that other men can only dream of in their oxblood seated leather wingback chair with the lights off. "
"Joe: Look, Dr. Crane, I just don't think it'll work out - okay? "
"Niles: No, it's not okay. If you had ever... smelt her hair, you'd know she's worth at least one more try. She is an angel, and she is a goddess - and she's waiting for you in the bathroom. "
"Joe: You got a minute? "
"Frasier: I'm never going to make it. Daphne, would you please get that? "
"Martin: Jeez, I thought you were just going to slit your wrists. It looks like you went for 'death of a thousand cuts.' "
"Frasier: I cut myself because I was shaving without water. And why was there no water? Because I had to move your chair, which gouged the floor, which made me call for Joe, who found bad pipes, who called for Cecil, who ate the cat that killed the rat that lived in the house that Frasier built "
"Daphne: That was the doorman. Senator Adler's limousine just pulled up. "
"Frasier: Oh, it's over, it's over. Sing, fat lady, sing. "
"Niles: Frasier, what are we going to do? "
"Martin: Will you give me your cash? Both of you, come on Hurry up "
"Frasier: Why? "
"Martin: Never mind why, just hand it to me. Come on, be quick, Niles. "
"Niles: Oh all right, do you want all seven hundred dollars? "
"Martin: You carry seven hundred dollars in your wallet? "
"Niles: Well, Maris asked me to stop by the drugstore later. "
"Martin: Just hand it over. Okay, guys. I've got seven hundred and some odd dollars here. If you can get everything cleared up before Frasier's buddies get here it's yours to split any way you want on your way out. "
"Frasier: Bribery? That's your big plan? "
"Frasier: Oh my God, it's starting to work Hey, here's another hundred I was holding out on my old man "
"Martin: Hey "
"Daphne: Dr. Crane. "
"Niles: Yes? "
"Daphne: Joe told me what you did. I think that's the nicest thing anyone's ever done for me. Thank you. [kisses Niles on cheek and jumps back] Oh "
"Niles: Did you feel that? We made a spark. "
"Daphne: Oh yes, we did. I guess you were right, it is just the carpet "
"Joe: Okay everybody, come on. Move it, move it, move it. We're out of here. "
"Daphne: "
"Joe: Are you ready? "
"Daphne: Good night. "
"Frasier: Goodnight Daphne, have a good time. "
"Frasier: Oh, my God, we did it, we actually did it. [Martin begins to exit] Oh dad, please don't leave, I'd like you to stay. I mean, you helped me to get this put together tonight. "
"Martin: Oh well, thanks Fras'. That makes me feel good. Not good enough to hang around that bleeding-heart-softie-on-crime Senator Adler, but good. Come on Eddie, the politicians are coming "
"welcome: "
"Frasier: Senator Adler, Mayor - welcome to my humble abode. "
"Bruce: You know you're out of T.P. in the can? "
"Time: 21"

"June: Well, my husband is always criticising me, because in restaurants I like to listen in on strangers' conversations. I don't know why he makes such a big deal out of nothing. "
"Frasier: Well June, I suppose your lack of interest makes your husband feel invisible. Imagine what it must be like to sit across from someone who's constantly scanning, [picks up the microphone and turns away from the console to looks through the window] searching, craning their neck to see... Just what the hell is going on out there? "
"June: Oh gosh, you're right I've been insensitive. It's just common decency to stay focused on the other person. "
"Frasier: Huh? What? Oh, well, good for you, Jane "
"June: June "
"Frasier: Oh, yeah, well, whatever Er, this is Dr Frasier Crane. KACL 780. "
"TO: outside Kate's office. "
"Frasier: What is going on? "
"Roz: Oh, our beloved station manager decided we're not getting our raise this year "
"Frasier: This is an outrage I have a contract "
"Roz: Don't palpitate, it doesn't apply to the on-air talent. "
"Frasier: Oh, thank God. "
"Frasier: I'm sorry... I was being selfish, wasn't I? I, er, feel very ashamed. It is nevertheless, er, an outrage. It's not a personal outrage but certainly a, a family of man outrage. "
"Roz: Frasier, I spent that raise already - on my new diamond earrings I love them. I love them so much, I slept with them "
"Frasier: Well, Roz, as long as you're doing it for love, it's a step in the right direction "
"Roz: Real supportive, Frasier We've been getting that raise every year, and now this Nazi in nylons comes waltzing in here and cancels it with some vague crap about corporate belt- tightening. This isn't fair "
"Frasier: Oh, oh, actually you're right Er you, maybe you should tell her what you just told me. Er, except I would leave out the 'Nazi in nylons' bit. It's not your best icebreaker. "
"Roz: Oh, you're damn right we're gonna tell her "
"Roz: We've all been here a hell of a lot longer than she has "
"Frasier: That's right "
"Roz: She pushes us, we push back "
"Roz: She's standing right behind me, isn't she? "
"Kate: Yeah. "
"Kate: Is there a problem? Nope? Good. "
"Frasier: Kate? "
"Kate: Doc...? "
"Frasier: Er, these people... would like to speak with you. "
"Kate: No, I'm sorry, I can't talk right now, I've got a meeting. "
"Frasier: Well I-I'm sorry, excuse me? I think your meeting can wait five minutes. Now they're a little upset about your memo. I think you should discuss it with them. "
"Kate: Dr Crane... I wrote the memo, I signed the memo, I posted the memo. If I had anything more to say, I would have put it... Anybody? "
"Noel: In the memo? "
"Kate: Bravo. "
"Roz: Okay. If she wants to play tough, we'll play tough back. We still have a lot of power here. Now we could go on strike... "
"Roz: Yes "
"Frasier: Look, look, you know er, I, I think you should listen to Roz. Every year in exchange for your hard work you receive a five percent raise. Now, you've fulfilled your part of the bargain; she has blithely changed the deal. "
"Noel: In the 'hood, they call that 'being dissed.' "
"Frasier: Yes, my streetwise friend. You have a right to stand up for yourselves. "
"Roz: Okay. We gonna do this? Are we together? "
"Noel: What's the point? If we strike they'll just replace us. They only care about the on-air people. "
"Roz: Aaah, so we'll get their support Frasier just said he's on our side "
"Frasier: I did? Well, well, yes I, I did, I did, yes. But, heh, my meagre endorsement is, is meaningless without the support of the... other talent. "
"Roz: Did you hear that? Frasier's gonna get everyone on our side "
"Frasier: What? Er I, I'd love to, to help, but you know, I'm already in hot water with that woman You can't ask me to raise a mutiny against her "
"Noel: 'The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few or the one.' James Tiberius Kirk, Captain, Starship Enterprise. "
"Frasier: Go away, you annoying little man. "
"Roz: Please? "
"Frasier: Oh alright, alright You organise your people, I'll talk to mine "
"Bulldog: Hey, beat it. "
"Bulldog: Hey, if you can't run with The Bulldog, stay on the porch. "
"Frasier: Niles. "
"Niles: Good evening, Frasier; you left your Mont Blanc in my car, so I... Oh. I see cocktails. Hors d'oeuvres. Mingling. If I were the suspicious type, I'd say you were throwing a party to which I was not invited. "
"Martin: Feel like a wiener, Niles? "
"Niles: Indeed I do. "
"Frasier: Niles, this is not a party; and dad, that is fourteen-dollar-a-pound andouille sausage. "
"Martin: Wow. Means Eddie ate about thirty bucks' worth. "
"Frasier: Niles, these people are colleagues from the station. We're here to discuss a labour dispute. "
"Niles: Fight on, people You know, there is no greater friend to the working man than my own Maris. "
"Frasier: Mmm. "
"Niles: Remember, when our stable boy Wakim's appendix burst? She had him driven back to the border at her own personal expense "
"Gil: Ah, good evening, Frasier "
"Frasier: Gil, Sheryl, Floyd "
"Gil: Oh What a stunning apartment "
"Frasier: Well... "
"Gil: The palette is pure, subtle elegance The detailing... well, it's inspired And the furnishings... Oh, dear. Is that a chair? "
"Frasier: That is my father's chair. "
"Gil: Oh. Well... this must be your father "
"Martin: Hi - Marty Crane. You put on quite a show "
"Gil: Oh, you've heard my little programme? "
"Martin: No, I mean just coming through the door. "
"Bulldog: Doc, doc Can we hurry this thing up? I got a charity event tonight. She's not much to look at, but what the hell. "
"Frasier: Okay, well, since we're all here... Er, now, regarding management's claim of financial distress, I've done some checking around, and I've found that the advertising revenues are up eleven-and-a-half per cent... "
"Daphne: Gil Chesterton, the restaurant critic "
"Gil: Yes. "
"Daphne: Oh, I just love those wicked things you say when the food is bad "
"Gil: Well, keep bringing these and you won't be disappointed "
"Frasier: The wage freeze is unwarranted. It is simply a ploy of an overly ambitious station manager, and typical of this woman She has terrorised us, she has tampered with our shows. It's time we said no to this Princess of Darkness "
"Bulldog: I got a better idea. Why don't we just walk up to Mike Tyson and tell him he talks funny? "
"Frasier: What about our support staff? If we don't back this strike, they may lose their jobs They're powerless without our support. "
"Gil: Frasier, old man, why do they need raises? You're talking about people who eat corn dogs and nachos. "
"Frasier: That statement is appallingly elitist. "
"Gil: Well thank you, Mister Everyday People "
"Bulldog: Hey, I'm sure we'd all like to help these people, but we need our jobs. We're working stiffs too, living from paycheck-to-paycheck just like they are. "
"Niles: Excuse me, someone's blocking me in downstairs. Who has a BMW? "
"Niles: A red BMW. With a red interior. "
"Gil: Oh, that's me "
"Niles: Just give me your key; I'll leave it to the doorman. "
"Gil: Oh, no no. I was just leaving. "
"Bulldog: Oh, I'm going too. "
"Frasier: Well... where are your ethics? Where's your conscience? "
"Bulldog: Where's your john? I need to slap on some Canoe. "
"Martin: Hey, I'm with you people To heck with the workers. They're not yours "
"Bulldog: Hey, damn right "
"Martin: And chances are, after the station manager crushes the little people, she won't come after you big shots. "
"Bulldog: Right. Why would she...? "
"Martin: Well, I mean er, supposing she's trying to save money, you're the big ticket items. Erm, after all this, well, she won't have to worry about the support staff backing you guys up, will she? Oh but no, that's crazy. "
"Gil: You're not suggesting that... Kate might be coming after our money next? "
"Martin: No, she wouldn't do that She's a peach, right? Soft as a cream puff. "
"Frasier: And we all know no-one here is overpaid... "
"Gil: Suddenly, I'm feeling very Norma Rae. "
"Frasier: Great I'll get us some more wine. Dad, that was brilliant, using reverse psychology I guess living with me is rubbing off on you a little bit. "
"Martin: Well, I guess it's only natural that environmental factors would influence personality development... "
"Frasier: Alright. "
"Martin: Well, oh wait I, I hope I didn't hit some long-repressed Oedipal nerve... "
"Frasier: Very funny. "
"Martin: Because the last thing we want is for you to be sublimating your anger passive/aggressive... "
"Frasier: Oh, alright Just stop it, you wise ass "
"Martin: Ha-hey Looks like I'm rubbing off on you, too "
"Frasier: Alright, people I have spoken with the on-air talent, and I... "
"Noel: Shhh Ixnay, Dr Crane... "
"Frasier: Ah, yes. You've really dropped the cone of silence now. Anyway, I have delivered on my "
"promise: the talent is behind you. If you strike, we strike. All for one and one for all "
"Frasier: Okay So who is our spokesperson - who is leading the charge? "
"Noel: I am - you want to make something of it? Oh shoot, I smiled again "
"Frasier: Rozalinda, a word. "
"TO: the studio as she enters and Frasier closes the door, "
"Frasier: Our leader is Noel Shempsky? The man has all the backbone of a paramecium "
"Roz: Well, do you think that it's my idea? Noel and I were the only two who volunteered. 'Course, they voted me down. I'm smarter than he is, more confident, more articulate, [hot- headed] but those stupid little WUSSES think I'm a HOT-HEAD "
"Frasier: But Noel, Roz A lot of people's jobs are riding on this - including mine "
"Roz: Then you do it "
"Frasier: Me? "
"Roz: Yes "
"Frasier: No no, me? "
"Roz: Oh, please "
"Frasier: Me? No, no, I've done enough already, oh... "
"Frasier: What? "
"Noel: Dr Crane, I can see that you're concerned about my negotiating skills. But don't be - I have a secret "
"weapon: I can faint at will. Check it out... "
"Frasier: Okay people, there's been a coup. I am now your leader "
"Frasier: To the lair of the She-Wolf "
"TO: outside Kate's office as a militant crowd of staffers, now led "
"Kate: Wow. What have we here? "
"Frasier: We are dissatisfied with the wage freeze and we demand to speak to you about it. Don't we? "
"Kate: Alright, but aren't you people still on the clock? "
"Kate: Well hi-ho the dairy-o, the cheese stands alone. "
"Frasier: They're a shrewd group. They only flex their muscles when they have to. [shouts to the off-screen staffers] Well done "
"Kate: Yeah, right. Will you get in here? "
"TO: the office. "
"Kate: I'm kinda surprised to see you here. This really isn't your fight, is it? "
"Frasier: I am honoured to have been chosen by my colleagues to speak for them. "
"Kate: Oh. That's a shame. I was kinda looking forward to seeing Shempsky faint. "
"Frasier: Well, we have a lot to do, so we may as well just get to it... Is that a, a new hairdo? It's very fetching. "
"Kate: Oooh, is that a new tie? It just lights up your pretty face. "
"Frasier: Look, what is it about us? I mean, why all this friction between us? For my own part, your intolerable smugness reminds me of my ex-wife. But... what is the source of your antipathy toward me? Was there some intimidating male figure in your childhood? A father? A, a priest? A department store Santa... I don't know, I'm just spit-balling here "
"Kate: I have an idea about the source of our antagonism. "
"Frasier: Good. Do let me hear it. "
"Kate: I'm a woman, I'm as smart as you, and I'm your boss. "
"Frasier: Coincidences, all "
"Kate: Doc... I don't want to analyse your hang-ups. I already got a full-time job. Let's just get down to business, okay? "
"Frasier: Oh, very well. There's really very little to discuss. These people were promised a raise. They have fulfilled their part of the bargain; it's time for you to honour yours. You have twenty-four hours. "
"Kate: Or? "
"Frasier: We walk, en masse. Including the on-air talent. I've seen to that myself. "
"Kate: You have. "
"Frasier: Mmm-hm. "
"Kate: Why are you gunning for me? "
"Frasier: Gunning? For you? This isn't about you, it's about what you're doing to those people. It's the shame of Seattle "
"Kate: No, no; this is about your ego, which is the SIZE of Seattle Every suggestion, every decision I've made has been met by this impenetrable wall of arrogance masquerading as righteousness. "
"Frasier: Oh ho ho ho ho, that's a desperate shot - attacking me because I have a social conscience "
"Kate: No, what you have is a fat contract, and so do the rest of your cronies. So when it came time for staff raises, there was no more money left in the till "
"Frasier: Oh, you are twisting things to make it look like it's my fault Oh, it's true what they "
"say: the devil comes disguised as a beautiful woman "
"Kate: There would've been raises if you hadn't taken all the money to pay for those Armani suits. "
"Frasier: Oh, oh, what about you? Let's not overlook that pricey little Fendi scarf you're wearing "
"Kate: Well, what about this designer cologne on you? "
"Frasier: Well, how about those pouty lips that must have cost you a fortune in collagen injections "
"Kate: These lips are mine, you arrogant gasbag "
"Frasier: You intractable despot "
"Kate: BLOWHARD "
"Frasier: TYRANT "
"Kate: ASS "
"Frasier: SHREW "
"Kate: Get out... "
"Kate: Now "
"TO: "
"Martin: Hey, Niles "
"Niles: Maris found a grey hair. "
"Martin: Daphne, get Niles a brandy. "
"Niles: It was right at the apex of her widow's peak. "
"Martin: Better bring the bottle "
"Niles: She blames me, dad. She said it's from the stress I caused her last night when I thoughtlessly turned on the light while she was getting undressed. "
"Daphne: Oh Good evening, Dr Crane Oh, let me take that for you. After all, you are the friend of the working man "
"Frasier: Thank you, Daphne. "
"Daphne: Defender of the little people... "
"Frasier: Alright, Daphne... "
"Daphne: Standing up to the boss on behalf of the downtrodden, selflessly risking your own... "
"Frasier: Don't you have some meat to boil? "
"Frasier: I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I apologise, it's just been a, a, a bad day. I was elected by the employees to present our demands to, to Kate. "
"Daphne: Oh well, that was a smart move Did you give her a good tongue-lashing? "
"Frasier: In a manner of speaking, yes. "
"Martin: I'm proud of you, son. "
"Frasier: No, don't be, dad - I'm a fraud. "
"Frasier: I, I was in her office... tempers flared and, the next thing I knew, we were... "
"Frasier: ...locked in a... passionate kiss "
"Daphne: Ooooh, go on "
"Frasier: Daphne, I'm really not that comfortable talking about this in front of you. "
"Daphne: Oh, no need to be shy around me. I'm a professional health care worker I've seen it all I've helped your father in and out of the bathtub. "
"Martin: Okay, Daphne... "
"Daphne: I've seen his bits "
"Martin: Just tell her, will you? "
"Frasier: Oh, alright. It was like nothing I've ever experienced before, it was just... pure sex Overwhelming, unexpected, animal-like "
"Niles: Oh well, that We've all experienced that, who hasn't? Pfff "
"Daphne: I'm no stranger to that feeling meself. It can strike without warning. And you don't know who it will be Why, you could be standing next to a person month after month, and then the next thing you know, you're tearing each other's clothes off There's a word for it... "
"Niles: Hope. "
"Daphne: Hmmm? "
"Frasier: Oh, this is madness I'm actually lusting after a woman that does nothing but grate on my nerves. I can't stand her "
"Daphne: Oh really, Dr Crane Would a man want to have sex with a woman he doesn't even like? "
"Frasier: What about her? Maybe she's been harbouring feelings for me. Is it possible that she could have been lusting after me all this time? "
"Martin: Oh, it could be. But... you know, you were in the middle of a negotiation. Maybe she laid that smackeroo on you just to rattle your brain. "
"Niles: Dad has a point. Your musk-drenched animal magnetism aside, it's quite possible that she was simply manipulating you. "
"Frasier: Oh, I hardly think so. The woman's passion... seemed genuine. "
"Daphne: Yes - it always does. [gets up and goes to the dining table] "
"Frasier: Do you suppose it's possible she's just using sex to sway me to her side? "
"Martin: Well, figure it out. Who made the first move? You or her? "
"Frasier: There was no first move. It was more like spontaneous sexual combustion. "
"Martin: There's always a first move. Think. "
"Frasier: Alright. I was standing in front of her desk like so. [walks up to the coffee table in front of Niles] She was facing me... Niles, you be Kate. "
"Niles: I will not. "
"Frasier: Look, just stand up "
"Niles: I'm always the girl In every prep school play I was the girl Guinevere, Marian the Librarian, Ado Annie. Well, no more, I'm through with it When do I get to be Shoeless Joe from Hannibal, Mo'? "
"Frasier: Alright. I'll just have to go down there and confront her myself. [grabs his coat and wears it, while walking to the door] Find out if what she was feeling was actually genuine or she was simply being a conniving femme fatale "
"Daphne: Oh, come on now, Dr Crane It's not like men have never used sex to get what they want. "
"Frasier: How can we possibly USE sex to get what we want? Sex IS what we want "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Kate. "
"Kate: Frasier. "
"Frasier: Er... I think we have some issues to discuss. "
"Kate: Me too. Have a seat. "
"Frasier: I'd prefer to stand. "
"Kate: Me too. "
"Frasier: Let's talk about the kiss. "
"Kate: Yeah. Let's. "
"Frasier: Alright. Why did it happen? Some "
"possibilities: [sidles up to the desk] Er, frustration; passion; the stress of the situation; Manipulation. "
"Kate: Manipulation... that is interesting. "
"Frasier: What's interesting is that you focused on manipulation. Why...? "
"Kate: Because there's a possibility of manipulation. "
"Frasier: So, you admit that you were manipulating me "
"Kate: Me? I'm talking about you How dare you think I'd do a thing like that "
"Frasier: Well, it's not unheard of for a woman like you to use her feminine wiles to get what she wants. "
"Kate: Oh, very clever What about you using your masculine wiles to get what you want? "
"Frasier: You think my wiles are masculine? "
"Kate: No, I am not going down that road again. "
"Frasier: 'Course you're not. Because at the end of that road is a cul-de-sac of vulnerability. That's not you, is it? No, you're cement-hard. "
"Kate: Alright, listen. You see me for a couple of hours out of every day, and you think you know me? The me me? Alright, I can be tough - okay, I've gotta be. I can also be tender... spontaneous... shy... lusty... playful. "
"Frasier: Kittenish? "
"Kate: I could climb you like a scratching post. "
"Kate: Damn it "
"Frasier: Now... there are people out there counting on us "
"Kate: Right, you're absolutely right. We've gotta put personal pleasure aside until we get this thing resolved. "
"Frasier: Absolutely. We owe it to them. If it takes every minute of every hour of every day, and every ounce of strength we have, we have got to settle this strike [claps his hands together] Alright. Those people deserve a five percent raise. "
"Kate: I'll give you three. "
"Frasier: Four "
"Kate: Done. "
"TO: outside at the same time. Plenty of KACL staffers and "
"Bulldog: Hey, any news? "
"Roz: Frasier's hanging tough He just keeps pounding that desk and saying, 'More, more, more' "
"Bulldog: Okay "
"Frasier: Good news - she's offered three percent. "
"Frasier: No, never I'm going to get you four I don't care if I have to stay in there all night "
"name: 'FRASIER, FRASIER, FRASIER' "

"Daphne: Previously on Frasier... "
"episode: pay raise; manipulate him; "
"TO: "
"Niles: Frasier "
"Frasier: Damn, I didn't think you'd be here... "
"Niles: Well, I would've gone to my regular haunt, but 'The Pig 'N Swig' is closed for remodelling. "
"Frasier: I'm sorry, Niles, it's just... I'm meeting Kate here. We want to discuss the little dilemma in which we find ourselves. "
"Niles: If you're talking about the little kiss you two shared, that hardly constitutes a dilemma. It's not as if you plunged into a tawdry office affair. "
"Frasier: No. "
"Niles: Then you'd have a real problem. "
"Frasier: Yes. "
"Niles: A kiss? It's nothing. "
"Frasier: Right. "
"Niles: Had sex with her, didn't you? "
"Frasier: I didn't mean to It just... happened One minute we were negotiating, the next minute our inhibitions were shattered, along with my kneecap and her Macintosh PowerBook. "
"Niles: This happened in her office? "
"Frasier: Yes. "
"Niles: What are you saying? Her couch folds out? "
"Frasier: We used her desk. "
"Niles: Her desk folds out? "
"Frasier: There she is Look, look, just make an excuse and go, okay? "
"Niles: Alright, okay. "
"Kate: Dr. Crane. "
"Niles: Oh, look at the time I, er, have a session with my multiple personality. "
"Frasier: Ah. "
"Niles: Well, not to worry. If I'm late he can just talk amongst himself. "
"Kate: So... good morning. "
"Frasier: Good morning. "
"Kate: How's your knee? "
"Frasier: Ah. Well er, it's better, thanks. "
"Frasier: And... and your laptop? I refer to your computer. "
"Kate: A little dented, but fine. The computer. "
"Frasier: Ah. Anyway, what I wanted to tell you was that, well, last night was one of the greatest nights of lovemaking I've had since... Roz "
"Kate: Tell me she just walked in. "
"Roz: Well, hi Guess you guys kissed and made up, huh? "
"Frasier: Well, in a manner of speaking, yes. We were just discussing the step system in a new healthcare plans co- payment scheme and... well, it wouldn't interest you. "
"Roz: Oh, the hell it wouldn't You know they're too cheap to pay for a butt-lift? I sit on this thing all day long, that's work-related "
"Kate: Listen, I really have to go, but I would like to discuss this matter at the first possible opportunity. "
"Frasier: So would I. "
"Kate: Oh, oh, oh, oh, I almost forgot. I need you two to fill in the eight-to-ten slot tonight. Floyd, the Happy Chef, is in rehab again. "
"Frasier: Ah. "
"Roz: Oh, great I was supposed to have dinner with a successful, handsome doctor She thinks we're all as happy to work all night as she is. "
"Frasier: Mmm. "
"Roz: Well, you're a psychiatrist, Frasier. She's a cold, repressed workaholic who has no sex life whatsoever. Can't you help her? "
"Frasier: I've tried, Roz. "
"Frasier: Why do we bother having a service elevator? I just rode up nineteen floors with two sweaty moving men munching on chili-dogs which they proceeded to drip onto my suede shoes. How will I ever get that stain out? "
"Frasier: Ah, yes. Dog saliva Nature's miracle solvent. [hangs up his coat] So who's moving out anyway? "
"Daphne: Deirdre Sauvage, the one who writes the romance novels. "
"Martin: Yeah, the lost Gabor sister's finally outta here. "
"Daphne: Well, she's a very sweet person and I'm going to miss her. "
"Martin: Well, you're not the one she's always undressing with her eyes. She lured me into her apartment one time, supposedly to fix a lamp. Next thing I know, I got a drink in my hand and she's reading me a dirty poem about meadow walks. "
"Frasier: Well, I must admit she's never done that to me. "
"Martin: Yeah well, if she does, don't fake a charley horse to get outta there. She'll just try to rub it "
"Daphne: Speaking of romance, Dr. Crane... when I washed your shirt this morning, I couldn't help noticing lipstick in the oddest places. I'll take it negotiations went well last night...? "
"Frasier: I'd rather not discuss it, thank you. "
"Martin: Why, is there a problem? "
"Frasier: Things between me and Kate just went a little faster than I intended. "
"Daphne: I'll say There were also four buttons missing, and teeth- marks in the shoulders "
"Frasier: Thank you, Inspector Moon Things got a little out of hand. I think we should slow down a bit but er, I'm afraid to tell her for fear of hurting her feelings. Daphne, how about a woman's perspective? Let's just say, for argument's sake, that you and I succumbed to a, a night of passion... "
"Daphne: What, you and me? "
"Frasier: Yes... "
"Daphne: What - bosoms heaving, shirt buttons catapulting through the air? "
"Frasier: It's a hypothetical question "
"Daphne: I'll say it is "
"Frasier: Oh, alright, somebody else Alright? So, you have a, a mad tryst with this young man, and then the next day he says that he thinks things are going too fast; he'd like to slow down. What would you say? "
"Daphne: I suppose I'd say, “Thanks for being honest. You're probably right, we were moving too fast.” “Not that it was too fast for you last night. Ohh, no, we were right on schedule then, weren't we?” “But, now you've had your fun - though not too much, apparently – and you want to be my friend. Well you can just sod off, Trevor Mulgrew” "
"Daphne: You know, I think I might have some buttons for this shirt... "
"Frasier: You see, dad - the whole thing's a minefield. "
"Martin: Ah, you'll never learn, will you? Handling a woman's easy "
"Martin: You know, you kill me. Mister Psychiatrist, you've always gotta make everything so complicated. A woman comes on too strong, you just tell her to cool her engines It's the easiest thing in the world. "
"Frasier: Oh, Deirdre "
"Frasier: I understand you're leaving us. "
"Deirdre: Alas, yes "
"Frasier: Oh, do come in "
"Deirdre: Thank you. "
"Deirdre: Ohhh hello, Martin "
"Deirdre: You've been so kind to me - I wanted to give you my new address. "
"Martin: Oh, great I'd hate to lose touch "
"Deirdre: I also wanted to bring you a farewell "
"gift: my latest novel, 'Foolish Escapade.' It's the long-awaited sequel to 'The Rose and the Rapier.' "
"Martin: Swell "
"Deirdre: I was er, thinking of you when I created the character of Lorenzo, the lovesick gondolier... "
"Martin: How 'bout that? Hah Hey, where are my manners? Let me show you out "
"Deirdre: Oh, by the way, the lock on my suitcase is jammed. I was er, hoping that you'd come and... [strokes Martin's face, very flirtatiously] tinker with it? "
"Martin: Oh gee, you know, I'd love to, Deirdre. But I, I promised Frasier I'd do something with him tonight. "
"Frasier: Oh oh, dad, didn't I mention it? I'm filling in for The Happy Chef tonight... SHUT UP ' "
"Frasier: ...so, you're all hers "
"Deirdre: Oh, marvelous "
"Frasier: Goodnight, Lorenzo. "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Hello, Polly. How can I help you? "
"Polly: Oh, I'm so glad I got through I'm sitting here not knowing what to do. I find myself lacking a certain spice. "
"Frasier: Well Polly, if you want to shake up your routine, why don't you er, try something new and dangerous? Er, skydiving, belly-dancing, perhaps? That ought to add some spice. "
"Polly: What are you talking about? I'm making an apple tart and I'm out of cinnamon "
"Frasier: I see. Listeners, for the fourth time this hour, I am NOT The Happy Chef. I am The Irritated Psychiatrist, Dr. Frasier Crane We'll be right back after the news. "
"Frasier: And while we're on the subject of tarts... "
"Roz: I'm really sorry about that call. "
"Frasier: No, it's alright, Roz. Why don't you just run along for your date? I can handle the last ten minutes here. "
"Roz: Are you sure? "
"Frasier: Sure "
"Roz: I mean, I feel terrible leaving you here alone in the lurch. [whisks her coat off the back of her chair and rushes to the door] We are a team, Frasier; you just say the word and I'll stay... Hey, hold that elevator "
"Kate: Got a minute? "
"Frasier: Oh, yes. Er, look, I, I'm glad you're still here. [closes the door to the booth] Er, listen... "
"Kate: No-no-no, me first this time. "
"Frasier: Okay. "
"Kate: I really think that we should slow things down. "
"Frasier: Oh, I am so glad you said that I wanted to say the same thing but I was, I was afraid that you'd feel I was rejecting you "
"Kate: Oh, how sensitive. And yet, at the same time, how full of yourself. "
"Frasier: You are one tough nut, lady. "
"Kate: Well, all this definitely shows we're doing the right thing. "
"Frasier: Agreed. Frankly, now that we've got that settled, do you mind if I ask you a question about last night? "
"Kate: Yeah. "
"Frasier: What the hell was that? "
"Kate: I have no idea I... ever since I've gotten here, you have done nothing but irritate me like a persistent skin rash. "
"Frasier: Yes, and you me And, and, and last night was no different. You just kept talking and talking and talking, and I guess that mouth of yours just ticked me off so much I just had to have it "
"Kate: The whole thing... it's just, it's so primitive "
"Frasier: Yeah, yeah, animal We were just functioning on instinct. "
"Kate: It's fascinating, really. "
"Frasier: Oh, oh, let's not dismiss the element of danger - all those people outside that could have walked in any moment and caught us. "
"Kate: That crossed my mind... "
"Frasier: For once, in my cautious, buttoned-down life, I felt like a real bad boy. "
"Kate: I felt like a...dirty girl. "
"Frasier: What did you just call yourself? "
"Kate: I said 'dirty girl.' "
"Kate: "
"Frasier: You dirty girl. "
"Kate: You bad boy "
"Frasier: Dirty girl "
"Kate: Bad boy... "
"Frasier: Dirty girl... "
"Kate: How much time do we have left on the news? "
"Frasier: Three minutes. "
"Kate: Right... "
"Frasier: But that's alright, I can play lots of extra commercials "
"Kate: Oh good, good "
"TO: Frasier's apartment. Martin and Daphne are sitting at the "
"Newscast: In local news, Congressman Robert Gill was accused of accepting bribes from a waste treatment facility. Asked to comment, the congressman said- "
"Frasier: Yes YES I am a bad boy, aren't I, you dirty girl Come to your bad boy "
"TO: Niles listening to this in his car, agape. We view this "
"Frasier: Oh, yes... Oh, no Is that the on-air light? "
"Kate: Stop talking. "
"Frasier: You must have hit the switch with your elbow while we were... "
"Kate: Stop talking "
"Frasier: We'd better hurry up and get dressed while we still... "
"Niles: Stop talking "
"Roz: Okay, Fabio, I want two things. "
"One: you will never make another crack about my sex life. I don't care if I start dating a lumber camp. "
"Frasier: Done. "
"Roz: And "
"two: who's Dirty Girl? "
"Frasier: I can't tell you that. "
"Roz: Oh, come on, Frasier I swear, I won't tell a soul "
"Roz: Yes? Not yet, I'll call you back. "
"Bulldog: Doc, I got one thing to say to you... "
"Frasier: Go ahead, take your best shot. "
"Bulldog: I am so proud of you, man. "
"Frasier: Well, doesn't that just put the cherry on the parfait. "
"Bulldog: Now come on, you gotta tell me - who's the mystery chick? "
"Frasier: Bulldog, haven't you already seen? I've told half a dozen reporters that I'm not going to name names. "
"Roz: Yeah, don't you see this right here? ''I Won't Fink,' Says Kinky Shrink.' "
"Kate: Good afternoon, Dr Crane. "
"Frasier: Miss Costas. "
"Bulldog: Hey, hey, you're the boss - make him tell who his playmate was. "
"Kate: Bulldog, this is really none of your business. "
"Bulldog: Oh, but we got a pool going. So far, hot money's on Roz. "
"Roz: What? Oh, well, thank you, but I think I have a little more self-respect than to have a quickie with a co-worker on the air What kind of slut do they think I am? "
"Kate: Dr. Crane, could I have a word with you in private? "
"Frasier: Er, I-I'd love that, but I, I've got my show in two minutes. "
"Kate: Actually you don't. "
"Frasier: What? "
"Kate: I'm suspending you for a week. Bulldog, you're going on. Roz, you'll have to produce. "
"Bulldog: Alright "
"Frasier: I must say, I find that a, a bit harsh, all things considered. "
"Kate: Yes, I can see how you might feel that way. But the station does have certain standards and it is my job to enforce them. Now if you will excuse me, I have to meet with one of last night's sponsors - The Wholesome Family Cookie Company. "
"TO: "
"Martin: Hey Turn those lights out "
"Frasier: Why? "
"Martin: Deirdre hasn't finished moving yet. If she sees the light in here, she'll know I'm home You can see your living room from her bedroom. "
"Frasier: Her bedroom...? "
"Martin: She had me cornered in there yesterday. I don't mind telling you, I haven't been that scared since Korea. "
"Frasier: Don't worry, dad. Look, I have no intention of letting anyone in here tonight. There's a damn tabloid news crew down in the lobby. I had to go in the back way and use the service elevator. "
"Martin: Say, I tuned in to your show tonight. Why weren't you on it? "
"Frasier: If you must know, I've been suspended for a week. "
"Martin: Oh, no. "
"Frasier: I spent the last three hours at the observation deck of the Space Needle, looking down on a city that's looking down on me. "
"Daphne: Hello, Dr Crane. "
"Frasier: Daphne. "
"Frasier: I'm not here. "
"Daphne: Yes. Your father's not here either. It's so nice having the whole house to myself. "
"Niles: Daphne. "
"Daphne: Oh, how lovely. Now the whole family's not here. "
"Niles: I listened to your programme as I was driving home last night. Here's a bill to replace the front wheel of my Mercedes, and the second to replace the back bumper of some wretched little domestic car. "
"Martin: Go easy on your brother, Niles - he's had a rough day. "
"Niles: You're right, dad. Er, Frasier, please accept my apologies. I, I can imagine how trying this must have been for you. "
"Frasier: Thanks, Niles. "
"Niles: 'Course, it's been no picnic for those of us who share your name. My Maris took it particularly hard. When I left this morning, she was ordering new stationery with an accent aigu over the 'e' in our name. Hereafter, her memos will read, 'From the desk of Maris Crané.' "
"Daphne: Who is it? "
"Kate: Kate Costas. "
"Frasier: Wait, wait Alright, all of you. You know nothing about last night "
"Daphne: Hello "
"Kate: Hello. "
"Daphne: Come in "
"Frasier: Hello, Kate. Er, you know Niles, of course. Er, this is my... "
"Kate: Hello. "
"Frasier: ...father, Martin... "
"Martin: Hi "
"Frasier: ...and er, his healthcare worker. Daphne, Kate Costas. "
"Daphne: Nice to meet you. "
"Kate: I'm sorry if I'm coming at a bad time. "
"Martin: Oh no, no, I, I - we were just taking Eddie for a walk. "
"Daphne: Yeah. Eddie "
"Niles: I have to be running along too. "
"Daphne: Oh, what's that on your chin? Have you been in the garbage again? You Bad Boy "
"Kate: So... nice place. Whoa, what a view "
"Frasier: Yes. I'll be enjoying it during my suspension. "
"Kate: Well... I guess that concludes the small-talk portion of our evening. Look, it must be obvious; I've come here to apologise. "
"Frasier: Oh, really - for what? Turning on me when I went out of my way to protect you? You know we're both responsible for this. Yet I end up looking like an idiot and you look like a no- nonsense boss "
"Kate: Alright, alright, just tell me what I can do to make this right. "
"Frasier: Nothing There is nothing you can do, there is nothing you can say, to make this up to me. "
"Kate: The owners wanted you fired. "
"Frasier: That's pretty good "
"Kate: Look, there's no way we can rewrite the past. It happened, we did it, it's on tape. But we can do "
"this: we can prevent it from ever happening again. "
"Frasier: Agreed. Obviously, there's some kind of incredible attraction between us. The trick will be simply to avoid the opportunity. We're strong, we're intelligent... and we're alone in this apartment. "
"Kate: I'll get my bag "
"Frasier: Yes... "
"TO: the corridor outside Frasier's apartment. "
"Frasier: Oh Kate, Kate, er, that news crew's probably still in the lobby. "
"Kate: Oh, right "
"Frasier: Let me walk you to the service elevator and see you out. "
"TO: outside the service elevator. The doors are open; inside, "
"Kate: Going down? "
"Man: No, you guys go ahead. Just send it back up "
"TO: inside the elevator as it begins to descend. "
"Frasier: Yes... well, I'm sure if we really try, we can keep things on a professional footing. "
"Kate: We're two mature adults. "
"Frasier: Just have to avoid all undue temptation. "
"Frasier: What's going on? "
"Kate: I don't know. Hello? "
"Frasier: You know, let's have a little light. "
"Kate: Hello? Hello? Can anybody hear me? "
"Man: Hello? "
"Kate: Yeah What's going on? "
"Man: Looks like you're stuck. Same thing happened this morning. Took about half an hour to fix. You two guys gonna be okay? "
"Kate: Yeah, yeah, we're fine. We're adults. We're mature adults "
"Frasier: Ow "
"Frasier: It's getting sort of hot in here, isn't it? "
"Kate: Yeah. It's a bit - it's a bit hot. "
"Frasier: You don't mind if I take off my jacket, do you? "
"Kate: Makes no difference to me. "
"Frasier: Well. Looks like we're gonna be here for a little while - may as well try to make ourselves comfortable. "
"Frasier: Maybe there are some chairs in here. "
"Frasier: Ah, here we are I'll just have to move this down along... "
"Kate: What's that? "
"Frasier: I must have knocked open a music box in here somewhere. "
"Kate: I'm not really in the mood for music. Could you stop that, please? "
"Frasier: Yes, yes, I'll try. "
"Kate: God, it's hot in here "
"Kate: What's that smell? "
"Frasier: I seem to have broken a bottle of something... [realizes, gazes at her, worried] Musk oil... "
"Frasier: Oh, oh, where is that damn music box? [rifles through another drawer] Here it is [picks it up and turns it off] "
"Kate: I really think that it would be a very good thing if you just did something about that musk oil... "
"Frasier: Ah, yes, alright, er, how about... Oh, I know, hand me that drop-cloth there and maybe I can just smother it. "
"Kate: Who lives in this building? "
"Frasier: You know er, I think we can just forego the musk oil right now. Why don't you just cover, cover that back up. "
"Kate: No no no no no, not gonna touch this thing again. [brushes herself off] Look at me, I'm all dirty. "
"Kate: Ooh, stop - stop - stop "
"Frasier: You're right "
"Frasier: We have gazed into the gaping maw of temptation, and survived "
"Frasier: My God, I'm, I'm, I'm proud of us "
"Kate: I am, too God "
"Frasier: Ah... "
"Kate: Of course, the cable could break. "
"Frasier: And we'd be kicking ourselves all the way down... "
"Kate: You are so right "
"TO: outside the elevator on the ground floor, several seconds later. "
"Kate: Goodnight, Dr Crane. "
"Frasier: Miss Costas. "

"Vinnie: Anyway, Doc, I got this thing. It's, uh, got to do with women. "
"Frasier: Well, I sense you're having trouble finding Miss Right. "
"Vinnie: What, are you nuts? I meet Miss Right most every night Eager young college girls, tough career women hungry for a little R-and-R, if you know what I'm saying... "
"Frasier: Well, you're leaving precious little room for misinterpretation. But I sense, despite these frequent dalliances, that you're still not truly happy. "
"Vinnie: Well, sure I am. It's just that I lost a pinky ring in one of their houses — star sapphire, beautiful thing. I figured if I went public with it on your show, I had a pretty good chance of getting it back. "
"Frasier: Well, Vinnie, it's obvious you know nothing about this show, or how to treat women. But even more appalling, you know even less about jewelry A pinkie no more needs a ring than a neck needs a gold medallion "
"Vinnie: Just shoot me, why don't you? "
"Frasier: I'd be delighted We'll be right back after this. "
"Noel: Hi, Dr. Crane. "
"Roz: He's driving me crazy "
"Frasier: Well, Roz, we can't all choose our admirers. "
"Roz: It's gone way beyond the admiring stage. Have you seen this petition he's got going around? "
"Noel: Hi, Dr. Crane. Could you sign this petition someone 'anonymously' posted in the lunchroom? It's to the talented producers of 'Star Trek,' suggesting a new character. "
"Frasier: 'The all-powerful space vixen... Rozalinda' "
"Frasier: 'Four-breasted queen of the planet Rozniak' I'll sign that. "
"Roz: Frasier "
"Frasier: Well, Roz, television will never improve unless the viewers speak out "
"Noel: Thanks. I'd better go. Well, [makes the Vulcan salute at Roz] live long and prosper "
"Roz: Oh, just go I am the joke of the station. When I used to come in in the morning the guard would say, 'Morning, Roz.' Now it's 'All hail, Rozalinda' "
"Frasier: Roz, I think you should be flattered. Noel's attempt to immortalize you is-is akin to... a love poem written by Robert Browning to his wife. "
"Roz: Did he ever write a poem where he gave her two extra breasts? "
"Frasier: Well, I'd have to check my English Lit notes, but I think not, no. "
"Frasier: Hello? Yes? Niles, Niles, slow down, I can hardly understand you "
"Roz: What is it? "
"Frasier: Maris is missing What? No, I don't think you should drag the koi pond Listen, I'll be right over All right, just hang tight Roz, Roz, how much time left in the show? "
"Roz: No, you go, do whatever you have to do; I'll handle things here. "
"Frasier: You're sure you can manage? "
"Roz: If I can nurse quadruplets and still find time to rule Rozniak, I can do anything "
"Frasier: All right, what's going on? "
"Martin: Yeah, Maris is really gone; I'm on the phone with the station right now. "
"Daphne: Apparently she just vanished. No note, nothing. "
"Niles: Oh, Frasier, thank God you're here. "
"Daphne: Any news, Dr. Crane? "
"Niles: No, no, I asked the neighbors if they'd seen any strange cars in the neighborhood. One reported spotting something called a 'minivan.' But that was weeks ago "
"Frasier: Well, there's no need to panic, Niles. I'm sure she's all right. "
"Daphne: Oh, dear me... I don't want to alarm you, Dr. Crane, but I'm getting a very strong vibration off this. "
"Niles: Oh, dear God. "
"Daphne: I can see Mrs. Crane. She's waving this poker around and screaming, 'You thief Get out You'll never get away with this' "
"Niles: Wait... no, I remember. That's what she said to the decorator when he tried to double-bill her for the andirons. "
"Daphne: I was wondering why the intruder was wearing Toreador pants. "
"Martin: Yeah, Mike, I'm still here. Yeah, that's right, she's been missing three days. "
"Frasier: Uh, excuse me? She's been missing for three days and you're just panic-stricken now? "
"Niles: I only just realized it. The last two nights, I knocked on Maris's bedroom door to wish her goodnight and I was greeted with a chilly silence, so naturally I assumed everything was status quo. "
"Martin: Uh, thin. Make that VERY thin. Caucasian. VERY Caucasian. "
"Niles: Oh God, what could be happening to her? "
"Martin: Oh, wait, wait, you got something? O.K., uh-huh, O.K. [to Niles] Mike ran a check on Maris's credit cards, there's been a whole bunch of charges in New York. "
"Niles: Oh, God. She's been kidnapped. Someone's using her credit cards. "
"Martin: Yeah, O.K., slow down. Armani... Valentino... Cartier... Tiffany... "
"Niles: Any restaurants? "
"Martin: Any restaurants? Not a one. "
"Niles: She's alive "
"Frasier: Oh, Niles You're certain "
"Niles: Oh, yes From that list, she's recreating her infamous 'Sakes alive, I'm thirty-five' shopping spree "
"Martin: O.K., Mike, thanks a lot. Yeah, I owe you. Bye. "
"Daphne: Oh, Dr. Crane, I'm so relieved. "
"Niles: Oh, so am I. I'm exhausted. I was so scared. "
"Niles: Frasier? What's wrong? You look positively uncelebratory. Aren't you glad Maris is O.K.? "
"Frasier: Of course I am. It's just that... well, here you are, all panic-stricken and scared to death, and she's off on some shopping trip Don't you find that the least bit upsetting? "
"Niles: Yes, I suppose her behavior was a tad inconsiderate. "
"Frasier: Well, she left without so much as a note or a phone call "
"Martin: Frasier, stay out of this. It's between Niles and his wife. "
"Frasier: You know, I'm sorry, Dad, but this is not the first time we've experienced Maris's selfish behavior She always puts her needs before his She never attends family functions Doesn't that make you angry? "
"Niles: Well, over the years I've learned to accept Maris's eccentricities. "
"Frasier: Oh, she's not being eccentric. She's being arrogant and selfish "
"Martin: If he says he's not angry, he's not angry. "
"Niles: And even if I were angry, what would you have me do? "
"Frasier: Let it out "
"Niles: Well, I am letting it out I'm getting hives "
"Frasier: Well, that is a triumph of self-expression My God, man, why don't you just let out some of the words that you're dying to say? "
"Niles: Oh God, I am so sick of you and your relentless psychobabble "
"Frasier: A-ha You're not angry at me That was directed at Maris "
"Niles: Nope, that was for you This is for Maris "
"Martin: Whoa O.K., all right, Niles, now you got it out of your system "
"Niles: Yes, but it felt so good Let me do one more "
"Frasier: All right, Niles, this is good, this is healthy But you've got to channel it You must talk to Maris "
"Daphne: Oh no, wait That's beautiful [grabs a porcelain 'Commodore' statue] Here, this one's hideous "
"Martin: Hey, I gave him that for a wedding present "
"Niles: Well, all right, here "
"Marta: Dios Mio "
"Niles: Oh, Marta This feels wonderful You must try it "
"Niles: I meant at your house. "
"Martin: Oh my God, it's Maris "
"Niles: Maris? What? You said she was in New York "
"Martin: Well, I don't know, she probably flew back "
"Niles: All right, all right, no one panic, there's an easy solution to this Frasier, bash me on the head with this, we'll tell Maris there was a break-in "
"Frasier: Niles, Niles, stop it God, you are the damaged party here, not Maris "
"Niles: But-but-but-but the mess "
"Frasier: This mess is the physical manifestation of years of repressed anger It's time to draw a line in the sand and say, 'I have had enough' My God, man, show her your mess "
"Niles: You're right. It's time I told Maris I will not tolerate this behavior. I'm going up there and I'm going to demand an apology "
"Frasier: Good for you "
"Niles: I always hated that dynasty. "
"TO: "
"Daphne: How're you feeling, Mr. Crane? "
"Martin: I'm fine, I wish you'd quit asking me. "
"Frasier: Well, it's a reasonable question for a man who just ate a cut of prime rib the size of a hatbox. "
"Martin: Well, whose fault's that? You're the one who was too embarrassed to walk out with a doggie bag. For what it cost, that meat was coming with me, one way or another "
"Daphne: Goodness, we've been gone three hours. Probably have a dog with a full bladder in there. "
"Frasier: Lord, let's hope so. "
"Martin: Hey, Daphne, how do you feel about taking him for a walk? I just want to get in there and unbuckle my pants — since I wasn't allowed to at the restaurant "
"Daphne: Oh, sure. We all know how Eddie needs his exercise. I mean, we wouldn't want all that fatty meat he eats clogging up his aging arteries until his poor old heart gives out. "
"Martin: Oh and, uh, why don't you pick up some half-and-half at the corner store too? "
"Daphne: Get moving, old man "
"Niles: There y'are "
"Frasier: Niles? "
"Niles: Sorry to startle you, I let myself in. Want a beer? "
"Frasier: No. "
"Niles: I have to thank you for putting me in touch with my anger. I had no idea how therapeutic it was to just pick something up and smash it "
"Frasier: Well... you're welcome, Niles. But, um, how did things go with Maris? "
"Niles: Oh "
"Niles: I marched into her room and demanded an explanation. It seems that over lunch with her garden club, Maris heard that the new Couture lines had arrived in New York. So she hied her way to the airport, and in her haste she forgot to leave me a note. "
"Frasier: Unbelievable "
"Niles: Just thinking about it makes me furious "
"Frasier: Really? "
"Niles: Yes "
"Niles: So I told her, 'Maris, you were inconsiderate, and when you are ready to apologize, I can be reached at Frasier's' Then I stormed out and slammed the door. Of course, it was that fourteenth-century Bavarian cathedral door, so I had to get two of the servants to help me slam it. But what it lacked in spontaneity it made up for in resonance "
"Frasier: Well, Niles, you know I'm not usually one to toot my own horn, but I think in this case I was on the mark. You feel good, don't you? "
"Niles: I feel great "
"Frasier: You feel empowered? "
"Niles: So empowered "
"Frasier: And you'd like to switch to wine now, wouldn't you? "
"Niles: Oh, please. "
"Frasier: Hello? Oh, hello, Maris. Yes, Niles is here. I'll see if he's available. "
"Niles: Hello, Maris. Mmm-Hmm. Well, I know you're not used to me speaking to you that way. That's rather the point, wouldn't you agree? Uh-huh. I see. Well, thank you. I know this was a very difficult call for you to make. Goodbye. "
"Niles: She wants a divorce. "
"Niles: It's no use. She still won't talk to me. "
"Martin: Oh, just give her time to cool off. Call her again in the morning. "
"Frasier: Geez, you must be exhausted, Niles. Why don't you call it a day and get some rest, huh? "
"Niles: Do you have a blanket for me? "
"Martin: Oh now, Niles, you've been going through a rough time lately, you're not sleeping on any couch. You can sleep in Frasier's bed. "
"Frasier: What? "
"Niles: You're sure it wouldn't be too much trouble? "
"Martin: No trouble. "
"Niles: I wouldn't want to impose. "
"Martin: No, don't worry about it, you're family. "
"Niles: Thank you. "
"Frasier: Well, that was very generous of you. "
"Martin: Well, it's the least you can do after getting him kicked out of the house. "
"Frasier: Well, Dad, I was just trying to do what's right for him. "
"Martin: Well, trust me. I handled domestic disputes for thirty years. The first rule is, don't take sides. "
"Frasier: Well, it's just a little difficult when it happens to be your own brother. "
"Martin: Well, that's the second rule. When it's your own family, keep your nose out of their personal problems. "
"Frasier: This is starting to make some sense. "
"Martin: Well, maybe you should listen to your old man once in a while. "
"Frasier: I know. "
"Martin: I mean, I'm not a psychiatrist or anything, I'm just a cop. "
"Frasier: But a darn good one. "
"Martin: You're going to talk to Maris, aren't you? "
"Frasier: I'll be back in an hour. "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Don't ignore me, Marta "
"Marta: Go away "
"Frasier: Let me in, I need to speak with Mrs. Crane "
"Marta: Missy Crane say, no you Dr. Crane, no other Dr. Crane, and no Crane with a cane "
"Frasier: Well, at least tell her that I'm here "
"Marta: She know. Everybody know. "
"Frasier: Maris? Maris, we need to talk Oh, look, look, I know you're up there, I can see you through the shutters All right, if you won't talk, listen Niles didn't ask me to come here, I came because I care about both of you. I realize that Niles spoke to you rather harshly today. Truth be told, is it was I that urged him to express his anger. As hard as it was for you to listen to such criticism, you're a fair-minded woman and you must concede that he had a right to be upset [the window opens] Oh Oh, Maris By opening that window you're opening up a window to a long and happy marriage, that's good "
"Frasier: All right, you're expressing your anger That's good, too But, listen, in spite of that last little outburst, I am not going to leave here until we've had some sort of a breakthrough Well, I see our time is up, I'll let myself out "
"TO: "
"Frasier: I know you're there. After last night, frankly, I've had quite enough of your kind. "
"Frasier: You can stare all you like. I'm not going to give you anything to eat. "
"Frasier: Oh, all right, here. You might as well finish off this god- awful Shepherd's Pie that Daphne made. Lord knows it isn't fit for humans. Did that sound like 'humans?' I said 'Mormons.' "
"Daphne: You're not at your quickest first thing in the morning, are you? "
"Frasier: Well, it was a rough night. "
"Martin: Well, maybe next time you'll listen to your old man and not come between a husband and his wife. "
"Frasier: And here's Dad, all sleep-refreshed and bright-eyed, ready to resume his lecture "
"Daphne: Oh look, your brother left us a note. "
"Frasier: 'Dear Dad, Frasier, & "
"Daphne: when you wake up this morning I'll be gone. Thank you for all your help, but I don't want to be a burden any longer.' "
"Daphne: You don't think... no, I'm sure this is all completely harmless. "
"Martin: Yeah, my gun's still locked up... and the door to the balcony's closed... "
"Frasier: And we all know that Daphne's Shepherd's Pie is still in the refrigerator. "
"Niles: Hi-ho, everyone What are you all doing inside on such a beautiful, clear autumn day? "
"Frasier: Niles, you seem awfully chipper this morning. "
"Niles: Well, I woke up this morning and I had a realization. Like it or not, my life is changing. I'm single now, so I went out and rented a bachelor pad. Ooh, is that coffee? "
"Martin: Don't you think that's jumping the gun a little bit? "
"Niles: Oh no, Dad. Maris, uh, ordered me to get my stuff out of there by sundown, or else she'd turn it over to a church bazaar. Oh, and I got these jeans [pulls a new pair of jeans out of the shopping bag] Right? Right? And I'm starting a goatee, and I'm thinking of joining a gym, but I don't know whether aerobics or weight training is the quickest route to 'buff' Any thoughts? "
"Frasier: One "
"thought: seek help Niles, you've just been through a very traumatic experience here and you are deep in denial here. You are going through some very extreme emotions right now, and rather than feeling them, you're denying they even exist. "
"Niles: I'm not denying my feelings. I'm so in tune with my emotions that I was able to move through them quickly. In fact, I've logged them all in my journal. "
"Niles: Let's see, where are we? Here... “5 "
"AM: Blissful confusion. Something's happened, but what?” “5"
":01"
": Ah, yes. An overwhelming sense of emptiness and despair.” “5"
":07...” - this one's hard to read... oh, right - “Wept uncontrollably.” “6"
":15"
": All cried out. Hungry now. Ate entire box of Frosted Flakes, they're gr-r-r-reat” So don't you tell me I'm not in touch with my emotions "
"Martin: '9"
":45"
": get out the butterfly net.' "
"TO: "
"Niles: It's not easy for me to say goodbye, especially after so many years — all we've shared, all that we've meant to one another. Jean-Pierre, Marie, Bernard — thank you for your years of devoted service. As a personal favor, please look after Mrs. Crane. It'll be just you and her from now on. "
"Marta: Uh, the staff, they have a "
"question: Can we come with you? "
"Niles: Marta, I'm afraid this is a road I must walk alone. "
"Frasier: Must be very painful, isn't it? "
"Niles: Painful doesn't begin to describe it. But they're strong, they'll get over it. [some moving men come down carrying boxes; Niles goes over to them] Oh, watch that, careful with those "
"Frasier: Look at him, Dad. My God, he's locked in denial "
"Martin: Oh, for God's sake. First you get him to move out, then when he does he's not upset enough for you. There's no pleasing you "
"Frasier: Well, what would please me would be to see him actually experience some real emotion My God, he's walking through this thing like a zombie "
"Niles: Well, that's everything. Shall we? "
"Martin: You know, there's no hurry, Niles. "
"Niles: Well, actually there is. I have aerobics at five, and then I'm meeting with my decorator at six-thirty. Off we go "
"Niles: Have I got my wallet? Yes. [turns to leave, but turns back again] Have I got my checkbook? Yes. Have I lost my MIND? I can't leave This is my home You're not taking me "
"Frasier: Niles, Niles, open the door "
"Niles: Nope, nope, bye-bye Thanks for coming, I'll tell Maris you sent your best "
"Martin: Now, Niles, calm down. "
"Frasier: No, no, don't calm down Let it out This is very healing "
"Niles: Don't you ever let up? "
"Martin: Look, everything's gonna be fine. "
"Niles: No, it isn't. There's no life for me out there "
"Martin: You're just excited. "
"Niles: I don't want to be a bachelor. I didn't like it the first time. "
"Frasier: Niles, look, just sit down for a second, O.K.? "
"Niles: Where, Frasier? [wanders around the room; puts his hand on an armchair] Here, in the chair that Maris and I picked out on our honeymoon in Vienna? Or here, where I sit Sunday mornings playing Mahler while Maris dabs at her watercolors? Perhaps here, where we sipped champagne on our last anniversary. Guess that really was our last anniversary. "
"Frasier: Oh, Niles... "
"Marta: Dr. Crane? "
"Niles: Yes, Marta? "
"Marta: Missy Crane give me message for "
"you: if you say is all your fault, you no have to leave. "
"Niles: ...I can stay? "
"Marta: She waiting upstairs. "
"Frasier: Niles, before you make your decision, just make sure that you're remembering things the way they really were. Yes, you bought that chair on your honeymoon in Vienna. But remember, you wanted to buy the chair that you saw in Paris. Yes, you sit at the piano every Sunday morning and play Mahler for Maris. But you hate Mahler Besides Maris, who doesn't? "
"Martin: Look, just give him a little air here... "
"Frasier: Look, all I'm saying is that along with the good things in your marriage, there were problems — things you said you couldn't live with anymore. Now if you want those to change, you have got to stand up to her. If you back down now, you will go through the rest of your life feeling weak and small because you never had the courage to say, “I will not let you treat me like this, Lilith ...Maris” "
"Frasier: Well, I've lost all credibility here. Dad, would you please say something? "
"Martin: I told you, I'm not telling him what to do. "
"Niles: I wouldn't mind knowing what you think. "
"Martin: It doesn't matter what I think. What matters is what you think. Now if you want to walk up those stairs, we'll support you. If you want to go out that door, we'll support you there, too. "
"Martin: What are you, nuts? You're gonna go up there and grovel to that woman after what she did to you? "
"Niles: Actually, I was just going to get my car keys. [picks them up off the table by the stairs] But thanks for the impartial advice, Dad. "

"Frasier: Ah, Niles. "
"Niles: Hello. Is it just me, or are the sidewalk Santas getting pushy? "
"Frasier: Well, tomorrow is Christmas. I suppose they might be expecting a little downturn after that. "
"Niles: So? When does Frederick arrive? "
"Frasier: In six hours and twenty-one minutes. Not that I'm the least bit excited. "
"Niles: Yes, I'm sure he's excited too. First Christmas at daddy's. I imagine he has visions of sugarplums dancing through his head. "
"Frasier: No, Lilith doesn't allow sweets, he's probably got visions of bran. "
"Niles: Well, I've got my own reasons to celebrate. Maris and I may be together again, by the new year. "
"Frasier: Oh, really Niles? "
"Niles: Yep, yeah. I called this morning to arrange the delivery of her Christmas gift, and she said the only gift she'd accept from me was an abject apology. "
"Frasier: Going to cave into her, aren't you? "
"Niles: Au contraire. I told her I was not about to apologise, and from that point on, the respect in her voice came through loud and clear. No small feat, considering at the time she was speaking at the time through the hole in her massage table. "
"Frasier: Oh, hi Roz. "
"Roz: Hey. Double espresso, please. This last-minute Christmas shopping is killing me. I never know what to give the men in my life. "
"Frasier: Since when? "
"Roz: Ha, ha. Funny man. "
"Niles: Excuse me, I'll take care of this. "
"Frasier: Oh, thank you Niles. "
"Roz: What's new, Niles? "
"Niles: I have been keeping it under wraps but, Maris and I have separated. "
"Roz: Oh, my God I had no idea. I can't believe no-one told me. This is such a surprise "
"Frasier: That's enough, Talulah. You're not fooling anyone. "
"Waitress: I'm sorry sir, your card didn't clear. I have to do this. "
"Niles: Wait, wait What are you doing? "
"Waitress: The computer said 'credit cancelled by order of co-signatory.' "
"Frasier: Maris has cancelled your credit card. "
"Roz: Whoa, Merry Christmas "
"Waitress: Would you care to use a different one? "
"Niles: There's no point, they're all in her name. [he gets his phone and dials a number] I'm calling her right now and demanding the restoration of my credit card. And my bank accounts. And my phone service "
"Bob: Doc, I'm at the airport, and I'm having a lot of trouble getting on the plane. "
"Frasier: Now Bob, statistics prove that we're safer in the air than on the ground. "
"Bob: That-that's not it. I'm supposed to be flying home to Newark for Christmas, but the flight the next gate over has a flight to Maui. I'm telling you, it's calling me, Doc. "
"Frasier: Why are you hesitant to go home? "
"Bob: Because it's the same thing every year. I travel three thousand miles to sit down at the dinner table with my family, and what do we talk about? What's going on in out lives? No. Our hopes and dreams? No. We talk about the turkey. 'Boy, that's quite a bird.' 'Twenty-four pounder.' 'What time did you have to get up to put that in the oven, Ange?' "
"Frasier: 'Oh boy, that's moist. You must have been basting that bird all day.' "
"Roz: 'Are those walnuts in the stuffing?' "
"Frasier: 'Oh god, I forgot to put the rolls in the oven.' I guess what I'm trying to say, Bob, is that we're all in the same gravy boat. But you see, the important thing is that we spend time with our loved ones. Just think how you'd feel if you woke up tomorrow morning six thousand miles away from your home. "
"Bob: Well, I tell ya, that really puts it in perspective, doc. I got a plane to catch. "
"Frasier: Mele Keleke Maka, Bob. We'll be right back after these messages. "
"Frasier: Oh, Roz. What did they say, what did they say? "
"Roz: Oh, relax. Frederick's flight is still on time, he'll be here in less than three hours. Oh, and the florist called, you can pick up your wreath on the way home. "
"Frasier: Oh, fabulous. You know, every year Dad puts that kitschy creature with the lightbulb nose on the door. "
"Bulldog: Hey, great party. Best one ever, thanks to me. I hired a stripper Doc, you will never guess what her name is - Candy Kane. "
"Frasier: What are the odds? "
"Gil: For those of you who have not yet sampled the punch, here is my capsule "
"review: vile bouquet, unwholesome colour, ghastly taste - and a kick that is simply heaven. "
"Roz: OK, 30 seconds, Frasier. Out "
"Frasier: All right people, out, out, please. "
"Bulldog: Hey, Roz. You know what's over my head? "
"Roz: Almost any clever remark? "
"Bulldog: What's she mean by that? "
"Frasier: Oh, listen Roz. I know you've got a plane to catch and the traffic to the airport is probably very bad, so in the spirit of the Christmas season, why don't you just take off early, hmm? "
"Roz: You're going to read one of your inspirational Christmas fables again, aren't you? "
"Frasier: Yes, I am. Be a lot easier without you sitting over there sticking your finger in your throat. "
"Roz: Right. Merry Christmas. "
"Frasier: Merry Christmas, Roz. "
"Roz: Say 'Hi' to Frederick. "
"Frasier: Yes, and say 'Hi' to your mom for me. "
"Roz: Will do. "
"Frasier: Hi, we're back. As most of my faithful listeners know, every year I compose a parable that I hope will illuminate the spirit of the Christmas season. "
"Frasier: So without any further ado, I give you 'The Story of Olaf, the lonely little goatherd.' "
"Frasier: 'Once upon a time, there lived a lonely little goatherd. He had no family, and no playthings, so to amuse himself, one day he carved a little wooden flute.' "
"Frasier: 'A flute that he used to play during the long, lonely evenings. And the tune it made was very lovely, and all the people in the village below could hear the pure, glorious sound...' This is all very amusing, but nothing you can do is going to distract me "
"Frasier: 'One day, the son of a wealthy merchant heard the music, and while that boy had all the toys in the world, he was jealous of this little goatherd's flute.' "
"Frasier: 'So one dark- -night, one dark- -windy night...' "
"Frasier: 'The merchant's son stole his precious instrument, but when he took that flute home, he couldn't make it play. So he smashed the flute to bits.' "
"Frasier: 'When the little goatherd came down the mountain the next day, and saw his flute was broken...' "
"Frasier: YIKES 'He might have said that...' "
"Frasier: 'But instead he forgave the merchant's son. And the wealthy merchant adopted the little goatherd, and...' "
"Frasier: OH, MAMA – 'he said, upon meeting the merchant's wife...' "
"Frasier: 'And somewhere along the way, he learned the true meaning of Christmas.' This is Dr. Frasier Crane, wishing you a truly blessed and forgiving holiday. "
"Frasier: There now, you see? Nice try. Miss Kane's delightful performance aside, this just proves the power of my message cannot be stayed. "
"Frasier: Oh for God's sakes, what am I, a robot? "
"Frasier: And to all a good night. "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Hi, Dad. Ah, I'm going to put this wreath up here. "
"Martin: What's the matter with Rudolph? "
"Frasier: Well Dad, you know, I just think that Christmas decorations should be understated and tasteful. "
"Martin: Boy, I can't get one thing that I want. "
"Frasier: Dad, I'm sorry, but if I gave you one thing, God knows where it might lead. "
"to: Living Room "
"Frasier: Oh, God... it's my childhood Christmases all over again. Only now Mom isn't here to say, 'Shut up, you'll hurt his feelings.' "
"Martin: Oh, don't be such a Grinch. "
"Santa: Ho, Ho, Ho "
"Martin: It works when you step on the mat. "
"Santa: Ho, Ho, Ho "
"Martin: It can say 'Ho, Ho, Ho', 'Merry Christmas', or 'Happy Holidays.' "
"Frasier: Yeah, well I hope it can say 'Geronimo' because I'm going to throw him off the balcony "
"Martin: Well, I don't care what you think, it's not for you, it's for Frederick. "
"Frasier: God, I suppose you're right, Dad. I used to love this stuff when I was six. By the time I was seven I started to have questions. When I was eight I started spending a lot more time at the Bernsteins. "
"Daphne: Well, I'm off to Joe's parents' house. "
"Frasier: I see you've been busy in the kitchen. "
"Daphne: Yes. I'm bringing Grammy Moon's famous plum duff. It's a still flour pudding boiled in a cloth bag. "
"Martin: Who gets to lick the bag? "
"Daphne: No. You see, Grammy Moon had a secret ingredient. She'd soak it for hours in rum, then ignite it in a blinding flash. As soon as she came out of the kitchen with no eyebrows, we knew dessert was ready. [She moves towards the door, stepping over the Santa mat] You know, to this day the smell of burning hair puts me in the holiday spirit. Bye, Merry Christmas. "
"Frasier: Merry Christmas. "
"Martin: You know, someone's got to go back down to the storeroom, there's still something missing. "
"Frasier: You must be kidding, Dad. My God, this place couldn't look any more ludicrous. "
"Martin: Once I saw how those white hairs on his chin looked like a beard, the rest of the idea just fell into place. "
"Frasier: Niles. "
"Niles: Hello, Frasier... "
"Niles: I know, I know - 'Shut up, we'll hurt his feelings.' "
"Frasier: So, Niles, did you have a discussion with Maris? "
"Niles: No, but - I had an epiphany. I realised, cutting off my funds is Maris's way of saying, 'I love you' "
"Niles: She always uses money to get what she wants; ergo, this is proof she wants me back What do you think? [walks past Santa] "
"Santa: Ho, Ho, Ho "
"Frasier: I think Santa's said it all for us. "
"Niles: Dad, you have to get out more. You've started doing old lady things. "
"Martin: It's for Frederick "
"Niles: Oh, of course it is. Oh, that reminds me, I don't want to impose, but may I ride with you to the airport to pick up Frederick? "
"Frasier: Of course you may, Niles. Just have to wrap up his presents first. "
"Martin: So what did you get Freddie? "
"Frasier: Well actually dad, I ordered him the toy catalogue, from the special section called 'Gifts for the Gifted.' I got him the junior astronomy set, and the geology lab - oh, and a fabulous thing called the 'Living Brain.' You get to paint each lobe a different colour, then you stuff it inside the Living Skull. "
"Martin: Hey, you know what kids really like? They've been advertising it like crazy on TV. It's great. The Outlaw Laser Robo Geek. Its head lights up and it shoots death rays out of its eyes. Yeah. A little like that. "
"Frasier: Listen Dad, I think I know what Frederick likes. He's precocious, he needs to be challenged. "
"Martin: Oh, challenge him the other 364 days. One day out of the year, indulge him. Let him be a kid. "
"Frasier: Dad, I'm sorry, if Frederick's anything like me, the kind of toys he'll like to play with are... A kitchen set, a dollhouse and three kinds of Barbies [he grabs the delivery note] This is for a Franklin Crane from Kenibunkport. God, you realise what this means? "
"Niles: Yes. The Cranes of Maine have got your 'Living Brain.' "
"Frasier: No. It means I don't have anything for Freddie. [gets his coat] God, I wanted everything to be so perfect. Now he's going to have a horrible Christmas. "
"Martin: It's all right, listen, it's OK. There's a big toy store in the mall. They're open late tonight. Just don't worry about it. "
"Frasier: Well, that's easy for you to say, Dad. "
"Frasier: My God, it's Christmas Eve, the gifts I ordered are three thousand miles away, my son is due in an hour, and on top of it all I have to go to a mall "
"Santa: Ho, Ho, Ho "
"Niles: Oh, don't look at me, he said it. "
"Frasier: Niles, customers are marauding through here like a pack of feral dogs. Did you see that woman? She practically knocked me over on her way to the escalator. "
"Niles: Well, how about that woman near the cosmetics counter who tried to mace me? "
"Frasier: That was a cologne sample, Niles. That's what they do. Now listen, we've got five minutes. We've got to find a sales clerk. "
"Niles: Oh well, good luck. "
"Frasier: All right, we'd better find something ourselves, I guess. "
"Niles: Well hey, hey. This looks amusing. "
"Frasier: Niles, may I remind you we're looking for something educational? "
"Niles: Oh, oh, oh, oh, it has buttons. "
"Niles: What's it doing? "
"Frasier: It's flashing. Niles, please remember that Freddie tested in the highest percentile for cognitive skills and deductive reasoning. "
"Niles: What's it doing now? "
"Frasier: It's beeping, for God's sake And as much as I'd like to inflict this on Lilith, I'm looking for fast and educational, all right? "
"Niles: I wonder what else it does? "
"Frasier: Let's see if it protects your head "
"Niles: Ooh, here's something. Look at this, look at this. "
"Frasier: Oh, God. "
"Niles: It's called 'Ecto Goo.' "
"Frasier: Oh well, that sounds vaguely scientific, but what could he possibly learn from that? "
"Niles: Well, for starters, he can learn never to wear Armani to a toy store. [finally manages to drop the stuff] "
"Frasier: Let's see, I'll just have to remember what I ordered from the catalogue and look for that. First, the 'Living Brain.' "
"Kid: Living Brain? What kind of dork wants that? "
"Frasier: With any luck, the kind of dork who'll be operating on your prostate someday. "
"Niles: Frasier, Frasier, Frasier. Look, look, look, there it is. It's up on the shelf, it's up on the shelf. "
"Frasier: Oh, marvelous. "
"Niles: Oh, Lord. It's covered with dust. "
"Frasier: The brain is dusty. Could there be a clearer metaphor? [the box is empty] Oh, Lord. There's nothing in it. "
"Woman: Can I have it? "
"Frasier: It's an empty box, Ma'am. "
"Woman: I know, but I can put my son's Robo Geek in it. You know how scared he'll be when he thinks he's getting something this nerdy? "
"Frasier: Oh God, this is hopeless. We'll never find anything for Frederick. "
"Niles: Oh, Frasier. Just give him a cheque. "
"Frasier: But Niles, you can't give a cheque to a child. "
"Niles: That's what I'm giving him. It has a stagecoach on it. "
"Frasier: Niles, Maris cancelled your account. "
"Niles: Damn "
"Frasier: Oh, look. Look at that man's bag. 'Young Minds.' Sir, excuse me, is this store in the mall? "
"Man: Yeah. "
"Frasier: And it's educational toys? "
"Man: Mmm-hmm, nothing but. It's just a couple of doors down. "
"Frasier: Yes Petunia, there is a Santa Claus. "
"Man: No, they closed a half hour ago. "
"Frasier: Damn. Look, this is perfect, look a chemistry lab, and a picture puzzle and... You know, my son comes in, in half an hour and I've absolutely nothing for him. "
"Niles: He'll be in, in 22 minutes if he picks up a good tailwind. "
"Man: You ahh, you really need this stuff bad, don't you? "
"Frasier: Oh, you have no idea, it would save my life. "
"Man: I'll tell you what. Seeing as how it's Christmas... "
"Frasier: Oh, God bless you, sir. "
"Man: A thousand bucks. "
"Frasier: What? A thousand bucks? "
"Man: Hey, take it or leave it. "
"Frasier: Well, I mean, there's just no more than a hundred dollars worth of things here. "
"Niles: 'Ladies and gentlemen, we're beginning our descent into Seattle airport.' "
"Man: I'm just trying to do you a favour here. "
"Frasier: Well, it's some favour. "
"Niles: 'Please make sure your tables and seats are in their full and upright position.' "
"Frasier: Shut up, Niles All right, all right, lets see what I've got here. All right, I've got, ahh... Here's three hundred dollars. Would you- would you accept a personal cheque for the rest? "
"Man: Hey, it's Christmas. "
"Frasier: Oh, bless you, bless you so much. Very well, thank you. Niles, give the man a cheque. "
"TO: "
"Martin: Where's Freddie? "
"Frasier: Putting on his pajamas. Told me he would come in and say goodnight after he brushes his teeth. "
"Martin: So how'd you do? "
"Frasier: Well, I didn't get exactly what I'd ordered, but I think I did all right. I got him a microscope, a chemistry set, and a five thousand piece puzzle of the Great Wall of China. "
"Martin: Well, maybe he'll have fun with the boxes. "
"Niles: Dad, here you go, this is the last box from the storeroom. "
"Martin: Great. "
"item: a pair of fake legs encased in red "
"Niles: Now, was this what you were looking for? "
"Martin: Oh, yeah. Santa's legs for the chimney, you remember these babies? "
"Frasier: Oh, yes. Inspired some spectacular Christmas nightmares the year I found them under your bed. "
"Niles: Frasier, isn't this the smoking jacket you gave Dad a few years back? "
"Martin: What? Hey... How did that get in there? "
"Frasier: Dad, these are all of the gifts I've given you for the last six years. "
"Martin: Hey, c'mon now, shut the- put 'em back. Close the box, will ya? "
"Frasier: Dad, look at this. My God, they're still in the original boxes, never been worn. "
"Martin: Sure they have. "
"Frasier: Oh, yeah. This one still has the tags on it. "
"Martin: Look, this isn't the kind of conversation we should be having on Christmas eve. "
"Frasier: No, Dad? Well, what was it you wanted to say? "
"Martin: Well, you know Frasier, you're always giving people things you think they should like, instead of things that they really like. I mean, come on - In your entire life, have you ever seen me wear anything like that? "
"Frasier: Well, no. I thought you might like a change. "
"Martin: Well, it's like when you were a kid, remember? I wanted you to love baseball. I wanted to get you a bat, glove, everything, for Christmas. But you had your mind set on a microscope, so that's what I got you. "
"Niles: And then when Dad took us to a game, you spent the whole time looking for rodent hairs in your hot-dog. "
"Martin: I'm just saying Christmas isn't the time you try to mold somebody, which is what you're trying to do with Frederick. "
"Frasier: I think I know what's good for my own son. "
"Frederick: I brushed my teeth, Daddy. "
"Frasier: Oh, that's my boy. Come on. "
"Frederick: Bonsoir, Uncle Niles. "
"Niles: Et toi aussi. "
"Martin: Hey, you'd better get to sleep, or Santa won't come. "
"Frederick: OK. I know just what Santa's bringing me this year, Dad. "
"Martin: I bet you don't. "
"Frederick: Yes I do too. It's an Outlaw Laser Robo Geek. "
"Frasier: What makes you think that? "
"Frederick: Because I asked Santa for it in my letter. They are sooo cool. "
"Frasier: Ahh, listen ahh, Frederick, there's erm... [Frederick runs towards the bedroom] Frederick, where are you going? "
"Frederick: I'm going to make myself fall asleep right away, so the next thing I know, it'll be morning. Goodnight, Daddy. "
"Frasier: I'll come in and tuck you in, in a minute. "
"Frederick: Goodnight, Grandpa. Goodnight, Uncle Niles. "
"Martin: Goodnight. "
"Niles: Goodnight, Frederick. I'm going to go home and go to bed too. "
"Frederick: I hope Aunt Maris comes out of her coma. "
"Niles: He asked where she was, I thought the truth would just upset him. I'll see you in the morning. Merry Christmas. "
"Martin: See you tomorrow. "
"Frasier: Well, this is turning out to be quite a Christmas. "
"Martin: Oh, it's going to be fine. "
"Frasier: Done it again. Gotten everyone the wrong gifts. What is it about me? Well, here, you might as well open your gift now. No reason for everyone to be disappointed tomorrow. "
"Martin: Hey, I'm sure I'm gonna love it. "
"Frasier: I doubt it. Not exactly my night. "
"Martin: Hey A robe Great, I love it "
"Frasier: No, you don't. It's not a robe, it's a dressing gown. Noel Coward would love it, but it's not you. "
"Martin: Hey, I love Noel Coward "
"Frasier: Dad, you're overcompensating. "
"Martin: Some people are hard to buy for, I'm sorry. But, you know, you are too, I never know what to get you. Here. [puts present in front of Frasier] You might as well open this now. "
"Frasier: Yeah. Guess it was easier when I was small. 'Cause kids always know what they want, don't they? "
"Martin: Yeah, yeah. It's rough for adults. "
"Frasier: Oh, Dad... "
"Martin: Merry Christmas, son. "
"Frasier: How did you know? It's jut what I always "
"wanted: My very own Outlaw Laser Robo Geek. "
"Frasier: Oh, Dad - oh, oh, listen, are the batteries included? "
"Martin: In the box. "
"Frasier: Oh, Dad "

"Frasier: This is Dr. Frasier Crane. We'll be right back after this. "
"Roz: OK, after this spot we're gonna come back in 15 seconds, you do a station ID and then toss it to the news. I'll count you down. "
"Frasier: That won't be necessary. I have a built in mental stopwatch. As a child playing 'Hide and Go Seek' I was the only one who didn't need to say, 'One Hippopotamus Two Hippopotamus.' "
"Roz: Frasier, I've heard you. You're always either talking into the news or running short. "
"Frasier: I am not "
"Roz: I'll bet you 20 bucks you blow this one. "
"Frasier: All right, you're on. "
"Roz: No, you are. "
"Frasier: Hello, we're back. This is Dr. Frasier Crane tuning in for our second hour on the 'Dr. Frasier Crane Show.' In our first hour we covered everything from anorexia to xenophobia. What will be next? As always of course that's entirely up to you. So stick around – the Doctor is in and he's listening. [Frasier finishes, proud with himself until he realises he's forgotten a part and tries to rush it in] Ooh, this is KACL 780 AM... "
"Kate: That was very smooth. "
"Frasier: Thank you. "
"Roz: Oh, let's see. “One Andrew Jackson, Two Andrew Jackson...” "
"Kate: Look Frasier, I've been getting a lot of complaints from sponsors saying that their ads are getting buried in huge commercial blocks. "
"Frasier: I see. "
"Kate: So instead of having four blocks per hour we're going to have eight... "
"Kate: ...only they're only going to be half as long. I thought it might help you. And you want to stay on top, don't you, Frasier? ...Frasier? "
"Frasier: Of course, very much so, yes "
"Kate: Good. "
"Roz: Frasier, what was that? "
"Frasier: What was what? "
"Roz: Call me crazy, but when you were talking to Kate you had this goofy little teenage look on your face. If I didn't know better, I'd swear you got a thing for her. "
"Frasier: For Kate? "
"Roz: Mmm-hmm. Look at you. You're flushed. "
"Frasier: I had Mexican for lunch. It's not lust – it's a Chimichanga. "
"Roz: Frasier, I'm sorry but I'm never wrong about these things. "
"Frasier: Have you lost your mind? "
"Roz: Look me in the eye and tell me I'm wrong. "
"Frasier: Roz, you're wrong. [he turns away at the last minute] "
"Roz: Oh my God. I'm sitting on a powder-keg here. You've got a crush on Kate "
"Frasier: Stop it. Everybody knows you are the biggest gossip in the entire station. You'll be sworn to secrecy. "
"Roz: I swear I won't tell anyone. "
"Frasier: No, it doesn't count until you shake my hand. "
"Roz: Oh, all right. "
"Frasier: Roz, Kate and I... "
"Roz: Oh my God Kate's 'Dirty Girl' "
"Roz: Kate is the woman you had sex with on the air in this booth and you were calling 'Dirty Girl'? Oh my God I just need a minute. "
"Frasier: Alright. Of course it happened months ago. Only a couple of times. "
"Roz: Uh-huh. "
"Frasier: Our relationship started out so antagonistic. Then suddenly it just spilled over into passion. Intense, romantic, exciting... "
"Frasier: ...the whole thing's over now, but Roz, you will say nothing, absolutely nothing... Roz? Roz? "
"Roz: Boy, I'll never do that again "
"Niles: I notice you're grating that carrot at a 45-degree angle. Does that enhance the flavour? "
"Daphne: No, no. Just an old habit. "
"Niles: Ah And why exactly did you choose to grate carrots? "
"Daphne: Because we have carrots "
"Niles: I hope you don't mind all the questions. It's just now that I'm separated I'm going to have to learn to cook for myself. "
"Daphne: Quite alright. Tell you what. Why don't you grate while I put the chicken in? "
"Niles: Thousands of little metal teeth able to tear the flesh right off your... "
"Niles: No, no, false alarm. Normally I bleed like the Russian royal Family, but not today. "
"Niles: Interesting. You put a toothpick in that chicken. Now, is that to check when it's done? "
"Daphne: No, no. I'm just marking which one is yours. Dr. Crane, would you mind setting the table? "
"Niles: Oh, certainly. Just give a yell if there's anything else that you need to have grated. "
"Daphne: You've done enough grating for one night "
"Niles: Writing a letter? "
"Martin: No, I'm writing my memoirs "
"Niles: I'll take that as a Yes. "
"Martin: My old army buddy. "
"Niles: You know that's the improper use of a hyphen. "
"Martin: Somehow I don't think Maurie Dingman will mind. "
"Niles: Then I'm sure he won't notice that missing comma and that run-on sentence. Although this is a particularly glaring error. It's best not to end a sentence with a preposition. "
"Niles: Not to be technical, but 'Off' is a preposition too "
"Frasier: Evening all. "
"Niles: Good news. I have tickets for the symphony tomorrow night. Are you free? "
"Frasier: Well, actually no. I have a date. "
"Martin: With who? "
"Frasier: Some woman I met at my accountant's. "
"Martin: Yeah, when I was in the service – first thing I'd do when I hit a new port was go straight to an accountant and find out where the action was. "
"Frasier: I must admit I'm having a little trouble working up my enthusiasm about it. It's not the woman's fault. It's just that I find myself preoccupied with somebody else right now. Well, frankly, it's gone a bit beyond preoccupation. I'm having fantasies about her all the time. "
"Martin: Well there's nothing wrong with that. You know, when I first met your mother she was so upbeat and bouncy I used to fantasize about her wearing a skimpy little cheerleader's outfit, shaking her pom-poms... "
"Martin: Grow up you two I'm just saying it's perfectly natural. I can't tell you the number of times I was on a stake-out in the cold picturing your mother in front of a warm fire wearing nothing but a... "
"Niles: DAD "
"Martin: Oh, I'm sorry. One day your mother and I went on a church picnic and the two of you came floating down the river in little wicker baskets "
"Niles: Was that so hard? "
"Frasier: You know, I'm beginning to wonder if I have real feelings for this woman? I mean I think about her all the time. "
"Daphne: Ooh this sounds interesting. Who are we talking about? "
"Frasier: Kate from the office. "
"Martin: Oh, 'Dirty Girl.' She seemed nice. "
"Frasier: She is nice. Intelligent, accomplished. "
"Daphne: Well, if you think so much of her why don't you ask her out? "
"Frasier: Well, we agreed we wouldn't pursue things. Frankly, she hasn't given me any indication since that she's even had a second thought about me. "
"Niles: Added to which, if Frasier did pursue her and she rejected him, he could hardly rationalise it by saying she doesn't know what she's missing. She would know exactly what she's missing - she just didn't miss it "
"Frasier: Thank you, Niles "
"Daphne: You can't let fear of rejection stop you Dr. Crane. "
"Frasier: Well, you know Daphne, it's just not that easy really. Maybe I'm letting this romantic fantasy run away with me. Truth is we don't really know each other very well and, if she did reject me, I'd end up going to work every day feeling like a fool. "
"Martin: Hey, am I getting a whiff of chicken here? "
"Frasier: Oh fine Dad Frankly I've had enough of you and your adolescent wisecracks. I am not 'chicken.' I am just merely hesitant. I will ask her out tomorrow. Fine. I hope that makes you happy "
"Martin: I just thought I smelled dinner "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Oh Kate. Hi. There you are. I wanted to talk with you. "
"Kate: I'm just going down to the Billing department. "
"Frasier: I'll ride along with you. You know, it seems every time we speak lately the conversation always leads to ratings, commercials, demographics... "
"Frasier: ...hirings and firings, promotions, demotions, the odd skirmish over the expense account. It just seems all so dry and impersonal. Did I hit the right button? "
"Kate: Oh, yes Yes. Yeah. You did. You did. You hit the right button. I'm sorry – I've got a lot on my mind. "
"Frasier: Yeah, so do I. Kate I wanted to ask you… "
"Kate: Frasier, I'm leaving KACL. I'm moving to Chicago. "
"Frasier: What? "
"Kate: Yeah. I'm taking over a station there. In fact I'm going out on the 'Redeye' tonight. I thought, given our history, I should tell you first. "
"Frasier: Well, I'm at a loss for words. "
"Kate: Wouldn't you know it – on the day I'm leaving? "
"Frasier: Well congratulations. This is a big step for you. "
"Kate: Thanks. Boy, this was not an easy decision believe me. You never know if you're leaving a place too soon. "
"Frasier: All I know is that for the time you've been here I've certainly enjoyed having you. [Frasier realises what he just said and tries to apologise] Having you... "
"Kate: I know. I guess this is goodbye. "
"Frasier: I suppose so. Goodbye, Kate. "
"Daphne: My. Don't you look dashing? "
"Frasier: Thank you. "
"Daphne: So, tell me about this woman you're going out with. "
"Frasier: Well, her name's Donna. She's an art director. Or a park director – I forget. "
"Daphne: Look, I know you're upset about Kate leaving but cheer up. There's nothing quite as exciting as a first date. All those questions you ask. 'What's your favourite food?' 'What's your favourite colour?' 'If you were to come back as an animal, what sort of animal would you be?' If she were to ask you that one, what would you say? "
"Frasier: 'Cheque please' comes to mind "
"Martin: Hello? Niles, no one was mean to you last night. No, if you want to come over, that's great. Yeah, we'd love to see you. OK. Bye. "
"Frasier: Hey Niles. "
"Martin: No traffic? "
"Niles: Dad, you sounded lonely so I rented some movies. "
"Martin: Oh, didn't you know the VCR is broken? "
"Niles: No subtitles this time "
"Martin: Oh, that's right, I got it fixed. What'd you bring? "
"Niles: I have 'The Way We Were' and a classic, 'Casablanca.' "
"Daphne: Oh, I just love that movie. Is there any more heartbreaking moment in all of film than when Humphrey Bogart tells Ingrid Bergman to get on that plane with Victor Laszlow even though Bogey loves her? What an ending "
"Niles: Well, there goes my need to finally see that one. "
"Frasier: He cares deeply for her and yet he lets her go. Wonder why Bogey did that? "
"Niles: Why don't we put the movie in and find out? "
"Daphne: Because Laszlow needed her by his side to fight the Nazis. "
"Martin: Forget the Nazis. No man in his right mind would give up Ingrid Bergman. "
"Daphne: Oh sure Sacrifice the entire free world for a little Swedish meatball? "
"Martin: Look, I don't like Nazis any more than the next guy but what's Ingrid going to do with Laszlow? "
"Daphne: You're missing the point. What makes the movie so romantic is seeing Bogey go from a cynical playboy to a noble self- sacrificing patriot. "
"Niles: Oh why don't you just put on some trenchcoats and act it out? "
"Daphne: I'm telling you, if you're in his shoes you've only got one choice. "
"Martin: I'll say you do. You get the hell down to the airport and tell her to get off the plane. "
"Daphne: She's going to Lisbon to fight the Nazis "
"Frasier: No, she's not. She's going to Chicago to turn a Country & Western station into an all-talk format. "
"Martin: Where are you going? "
"Frasier: To stop Kate from getting on that plane "
"Martin: Well your date's gonna be here in a minute. What are we supposed to tell her? "
"Frasier: Oh, I don't know. Tell her I'm visiting a sick friend or something. Better yet – just tell her the truth. Sometimes two people just aren't meant to be together. "
"Daphne: Ooh – it's just like Redford and Streisand at the end of 'The Way We Were.' "
"Niles: And that's another one down. "
"TO: "
"Kate: Frasier "
"Frasier: Don't say anything. Just listen. Kate, this afternoon I wanted to say something to you but when I found out you were leaving I held back. Well, I'm not holding back any more. I can't stop thinking about you. Not just about the times we made love but about the possibility that we might have a future together. Now if there's any part of you that wonders the same thing about me, we owe it to ourselves to see it through. You see, if you get on that plane tonight you'll regret it. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon and for the rest of our lives. Anyway I think I made my point. What do you think? "
"Tony: Kate "
"Frasier: More importantly, what do you think? "
"TO: "
"Martin: Aw, for God's sake, you've been bawling the whole movie. "
"Niles: I have not – my eyes just itch "
"Frasier: Well, it turns out Bogey was right to let her go. "
"Martin: Frasier, what are you doing here? Look, Donna stayed to watch “Casablanca” with us. "
"Frasier: Donna, hi. "
"Donna: Hello, Frasier. How's your friend? "
"Martin: In the hospital? "
"Frasier: Oh, he's doing much better actually. They're thinking of sending him home tomorrow. "
"Donna: After a heart transplant? "
"Frasier: Well, he's with an HMO So... er... what do you say we have that dinner? "
"Donna: Great, I'll just grab my coat. "
"Frasier: Kate "
"Kate: OK; now you listen to me. I was so touched by what you just said at my apartment. You said everything that I've wanted to say to you for the last two months. Tony's just a guy that I went out with a couple of times. He just came over to say goodbye to me before I went to the airport. When you saw him you just looked so hurt... "
"Donna: You had a date with her tonight too? "
"Kate: ...but apparently you rebounded I'm sorry. I thought you were sincere. Hold the elevator "
"Frasier: Kate I was, Kate This woman means nothing to me. "
"Donna: Thanks a lot "
"Frasier: Oh, I'm sorry, Donna. I'm truly sorry. It was very inconsiderate, but that woman means a great deal to me. I'm sure you'll hate me, but I just gotta do what I gotta do. "
"Martin: I'm really sorry about this. "
"Daphne: Why don't you stay and watch the end of the movie. "
"Donna: Thank you, but I've spent quite enough time in this house tonight. "
"Frasier: Well... this is lucky. We can ride down together. "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Kate "
"Kate: Frasier "
"Frasier: Oh my God. I know you're upset. I don't even care about that woman. She's just a blind date I didn't even want to go on. I wanted to be with you tonight. "
"Kate: I know. I overreacted. I've been standing here for a half an hour hoping you'd come. I never thought you'd come. "
"Frasier: I can't believe I waited so long when all I had to do was say something. "
"Kate: Listen, it's not your fault. I could have said something. "
"Frasier: Well it doesn't matter. We're together now. "
"Attendant: Your boarding pass, please? "
"Frasier: Go ahead. Go ahead. Couldn't you just stay one more night? Just call them. Tell them you'll come in tomorrow. "
"Kate: I can't. I can't. I have a board meeting in the morning. "
"Frasier: Oh damn. All right I'll call you. Where are you staying? "
"Kate: I'm staying at The Drake. But, you know what? I'll call you. I'll call you the minute I get in. "
"Attendant: Ma'am, we're closing the doors. "
"Kate: Goodbye "
"Frasier: Goodbye. I'll miss you. "
"Kate: I'll miss you. "
"Attendant: Ladies and Gentlemen. I just spoke with our captain and we're having a little technical snag. So Flight 487 to Chicago will be delayed indefinitely. "
"Kate: I missed you "
"Frasier: I missed you too The minute that door closed I started praying for something bad to happen to your plane. "
"Kate: It's just like fate – like somebody's willing us to get together. "
"Frasier: I felt that way since the moment I met you. "
"Kate: Me too. Why don't you come with me tonight? "
"Frasier: I gotta work. I could come out next weekend. "
"Kate: Oh, yeah. Oh, great. You know what, you can meet my twin sister. She lives in Chicago. "
"Frasier: You've got a twin? "
"Kate: Yes. "
"Frasier: Wow. You know there's so much we don't know about each other. "
"Kate: Well, ask me. Ask me anything. "
"Frasier: Er... oh, I know. What's your favourite colour? "
"Kate: Blue. What's yours? "
"Frasier: Arctic silver. It's available on all the big BMW's. "
"Kate: Where's your favorite city? "
"Frasier: Paris Museum? "
"Kate: The Prada Musical? "
"Frasier: Candide Yours? "
"Kate: Cats "
"Frasier: Really? "
"Kate: Well I love cats. I have a cat. Would you like to meet Louie? [she points down towards the cat box she has with her] "
"Frasier: No, no. Allergies. Allergies. Cats. Not really much of a pet person. "
"Kate: Oh, really? Oh, no. All right, we'll work around that. You Know, what we can do when you come out? We can go jogging around the lake. Oh Frasier, the lake is so beautiful. Do you ever jog? "
"Frasier: Once. In a dark parking lot. When a truck backfired. "
"Kate: Oh, all right. We can do something that you like. What do you like? What do you like? "
"Frasier: Well, we could go antiquing. "
"Kate: You know what? I'm not one of those people for whom 'antique' is a verb. "
"Frasier: Ah Well, this is all good. The contrasts between us will make our relationship more vibrant. "
"Kate: Vive la difference "
"Kate: Louie's getting to you, isn't he? "
"Frasier: No, no. It's all right. "
"Kate: Well, you know, if this is really gonna be a problem there's a shot. "
"Frasier: Yes – and I understand they're completely humane [Kate stares at him in horror] Oh, you meant an allergy shot, didn't you? "
"TO: "
"Kate: I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Frasier. I'm just afraid that if I move Louie any further away they're gonna think he's a bomb "
"Frasier: It's all right. It's all right. So... er... you were saying that you love animals? "
"Kate: Oh yeah. I think that's one of the main things that motivates me to work so hard. I've always had this dream to get a ranch in Montana – you know? To ski in the morning and ride horses in the afternoon? I just always wanted to raise horses. "
"Frasier: Wow, life on a ranch raising horses. I always pictured myself in a penthouse raising children. "
"Kate: You still want more children then? "
"Frasier: Yes. You like kids? "
"Kate: Oh yeah. I love kids. I don't see myself mothering one, though. "
"Kate: You know, just to be on the safe side let me just check to see if there's another flight? "
"Frasier: Yeah, it couldn't hurt. "
"Kate: Excuse me – is there another flight to Chicago tonight? "
"Attendant: Not until morning. "
"Frasier: How about on another airline? "
"Attendant: American has one connecting through Atlanta leaving in 10 minutes. "
"Kate: Atlanta's good. That's a hub. "
"Attendant: Yeah, but they're way on the other side of the airport "
"Kate: Oh damn. I'll never get there. "
"Frasier: Look Kate – fate to the rescue once again. [speaking to the driver as they both get on] Sir – this woman has to get across the terminal post-haste. "
"Driver: Hey pal, this'll go a lot faster with just one person. "
"Frasier: Good point. Bye. [realises they are never going to see each other again] Pity, though "
"Kate: Isn't it? "
"Frasier: Well, Louie. This looks like the beginning of a beautiful friendship. "

"Martin: Slow down Hey Daphne, guess what Eddie ate in the park today? "
"Daphne: Ooh let's see. A hot dog wrapper? "
"Martin: No. Guess again. "
"Daphne: A cigarette butt? "
"Martin: No. Guess again. "
"Daphne: Apple core? "
"Martin: No. Guess again. "
"Frasier: Oh really, must you two play this ridiculous game? She makes some feeble stab and you say 'No. Guess again.' Then she starts flailing away with even more ludicrous answers, all the while you chanting 'Guess again', until she's gibbering like some auctioneer with a bad bladder. Then you finally reveal the answer at which point nobody even cares. "
"Daphne: I'm not sure which one of us got the worst of that, but I think it was you. "
"Martin: Guess again. "
"Frasier: Niles. "
"Niles: There's a half-eaten lizard in your elevator "
"Martin: And that's the last hint you're getting. "
"Niles: Oh Frasier, I had a breakthrough today with one of my compulsive gamblers and he gave me two tickets to the racetrack on Saturday. It's a luxury box – I though you might want to go. "
"Frasier: Oh I would love to Niles. Why don't you want to use them? "
"Niles: Well, the jockeys if you must know. "
"Frasier: What? "
"Niles: Diminutive, underweight figures in expensive silks wielding riding crops. It just reminded me too much of Maris. "
"Frasier: Dad, what about you? I've never known you to turn down the horses. "
"Martin: Ah, sorry. I've got poker with the guys. "
"Frasier: Oh well then. I'll just call one of my friends. [Frasier walks towards the phone before stopping suddenly] Jeez. This is sort of embarrassing. The first three names on my list are all back in Boston. "
"Daphne: What about someone from your wine club? "
"Frasier: Oh well truth be told Daphne, those people are insufferable bores unless they have a glass in their hands. Sherry, Niles? "
"Niles: Please. "
"Frasier: Oh I know. How about Ed O'Hanlon? "
"Niles: Moved away last year. "
"Frasier: Ooh, how about Edmund Kelly? If I know old Ed he'd never leave Seattle. "
"Niles: Indeed not. They buried him here three years ago. "
"Frasier: Dear me. Really? I'll miss him. "
"Niles: Yes. Three years from now when you think of him again there'll be a void "
"Frasier: My God how did this happen? I've been back here for two years and I've yet to forge any new friendships. "
"Martin: You'd better watch it Frasier. Next thing you know you're gonna be like one of these old people who are so set in their ways that they're only happy hanging around with people who are the same as they are. "
"Frasier: What exactly is your point Dad? That I've lost my knack for making friends? "
"Martin: Well I hate to bring it up but you never were very good at it. It was always you and Niles ever since you were kids. The two of you always holed up in that damned garage – at least until you burned it down. "
"Daphne: You burned down the garage? "
"Niles: Well, between Frasier and his Bunsen burner and me and my mosquito repellent…in retrospect it was unavoidable "
"Frasier: Still, you know Dad, I did have friends in college and back in Boston. It's only since I moved to Seattle that I've started falling back on Niles. "
"Niles: Ooh – 'falling back on Niles'? "
"Frasier: Niles, you know what I mean. Settling for what's comfortable and familiar. My God, you and I can go out together and I know what you're thinking before you even say it. "
"Niles: Well then I'm sorry you had to hear that Frasier "
"Frasier: You know what? This would make a wonderful topic for my show. 'Making New Friends' What are we so afraid of? "
"Martin: Why do you make everything so complicated? You wanna meet somebody new? You just walk up to him, stick out your hand and say 'Hi. How you doing?' "
"Frasier: Thank you Dad. I can always count on you not to overthink something. "
"Martin: Thanks Hey "
"Frasier: So why is it we have so much trouble making friends? Is it because we've become closed off? No longer want to reach out to our fellow man? Well I'd like to think that if one of you listeners out there happened to see me on the street you'd feel free to walk right on up to me and… "
"Roz: Excuse me Dr. Crane, we have to stop for a very important public service announcement HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MIND? You're opening yourself up to every creep out there "
"Frasier: Oh Roz that's exactly the kind of cynicism I'm talking about. I, for one, happen to believe in the kindness of strangers. "
"Roz: Well I believe in the strangeness of strangers [signals show is about to start again] Three seconds. "
"Frasier: Hi, we're back with the topic of friendship. Now let's go to the switchboard. Roz, who's on line one? "
"Roz: Good news Dr. Crane. It's Gerard from Stanwood. A new friend. "
"Frasier: Hello Gerard. I'm listening. "
"Gerard: Well I called for another reason Dr. Crane. But what you just said really moved me. I wish more people felt that way. "
"Frasier: Well thank you Gerard. I sense a kindred spirit. "
"Gerard: Maybe we could get together some time? Have a beer? Maybe I could…you know…comb your hair? "
"Frasier: Well thank you so much for your offer of friendship George but I really don't have five thousand dollars to invest in your French fries vending machine. And for the sake of those who do invest I suggest, Sir, that you find a better name than 'The Spuddy Buddy'. This is Dr. Frasier Crane wishing you all good mental health. I mean that today more than ever "
"Roz: I just love it when I'm right. It makes the day so good. "
"Frasier: You stacked the deck didn't you? "
"Roz: Oh please. You should have heard some of the calls I didn't put through let alone these faxes. Read some of these. They're sick. "
"Frasier: Oh Roz my listeners are not sick…[reads some of the faxes]…although this one does bear watching Here's one that has promise. 'Dear Dr. Crane. I never thought I'd write a letter like this but I was moved by today's show. As a photographer I come into contact with new people on a daily basis yet I often find it difficult to make that one on one connection. However your words offered hope and I just wanted to say thank you. Sincerely. Bob Reynolds.' "
"Roz: Doesn't sound too wacky. "
"Frasier: You know what? I think I'm going to give Mr. Bob Reynolds a call. "
"Roz: Are you nuts? He could be a raving psychopath with a trunkful of decomposing squirrels. "
"Frasier: Oh rubbish Roz. I'm going to call him. Where did you come up with such a disgusting image? "
"Roz: Meet Garth from Tacoma. "
"Niles: You're late today but I'm glad you're here. I need your help. My designer is ready to mutiny if I don't pick a fabric for my new couch. Now I've brought lots of swatches so make yourself comfortable. "
"Frasier: Frankly Niles I'm not here to see you. I'm meeting a new friend. "
"Niles: A new friend? "
"Frasier: Yes, you remember I was talking about widening my circle of friends. "
"Niles: Oh I see. No more 'falling back on Niles' "
"Frasier: It's not that I'm trying to replace you Niles. It's just that Bob and I… "
"Niles: Bob? You're dumping me for someone named Bob? "
"Frasier: Niles I am not dumping you. I'm just worried that Bob might feel awkward meeting the two of us. "
"Niles: Oh well we wouldn't want to make Bob feel uncomfortable now would we? I mean after all I've only been your brother for……38 years now. What does that mean when there's the possibility that Bob may feel awkward? "
"Waitress: There's a man over there who says he's waiting for you. "
"Niles: No doubt the much ballyhooed Bob "
"Frasier: Niles. "
"Niles: Oh it's all right. It's all right. I'll go quietly. Don't worry about me. I'll be fine. I'll just go home to my Maris. Oh that's right "
"Frasier: Bob? "
"Bob: Dr. Crane. "
"Frasier: Call me Frasier. "
"Bob: Frasier then. I'm glad you called. "
"Frasier: Coffee please. Well uh…so. "
"Bob: So. "
"Frasier: So. Listen, thank you for your fax. "
"Bob: I listen to your show all the time. I think you're brilliant. You're probably sick of hearing that though right? "
"Frasier: One would think but it's my cross. "
"Bob: That's the thing I love about your show. You're not just serious. You can be funny. "
"Frasier: Well, I believe humour can be a therapeutic tool. "
"Bob: Against the assault of laughter nothing can stand. "
"Frasier: Mark Twain. 'The Mysterious Stranger'. I have a first edition. "
"Bob: I'm a collector myself. "
"Frasier: You know I was a bit trepidatious about this experiment Bob, but I'm feeling a real simpatico here. "
"Bob: Yeah, me too. "
"Frasier: I'm going to go out on a limb. What do you say once we finish these coffees we treat ourselves to a proper dinner? "
"Bob: Hey that sounds great. "
"Frasier: OK. Say, what are you reading? "
"Bob: It's my bible. 'The Big Book of Barbecue' by Jeff Filgo. He's a Texan. Of course all Texans think they invented barbecue. Arrogant bastards You like barbecue? "
"Frasier: Well…um…national holiday…4th July. "
"Bob: You know the secret to good barbecue? Mesquite. And the secret to mesquite is you gotta soak them in water for 10 minutes. On special occasions I'll soak them in beer. Once I soaked them in Sake for that 'flavour of the Far East'. You know in Japan they call their barbecues 'hibachis'? The arrogant bastards I'm digging my own barbecue pit right now… "
"Bob: …my speciality is the Shian Smoky Quail. The trick is a high engulfing flame. Like a forest fire. Of course they call forest fires 'nature's barbecue'. You know my co-workers call me 'Shish-ka-Bob'? "
"Frasier: Well Bob. Do you have any charcoal free interests? "
"Bob: Yeah I'm a professional photographer. The camera never lies. "
"Frasier: I'm a bit of a camera buff myself. What's your trade? Photo journalist? "
"Bob: I take kids portraits at Value-Mart Where your dollar buys more You know what? Why don't we talk about this over dinner? "
"Frasier: You know, Bob, about that dinner? How about Tex-Mex? "
"Bob: You're talking my language. "
"Daphne: No you don't. I'm fixing you a breakfast drink with fresh fruit, yoghurt, carob, pitted prunes. A healthy body makes for a sunny disposition. "
"Martin: You want sunny? Let me have my fritter. "
"Daphne: Oh shush. There we are. "
"Martin: There just aren't enough drinks that build up a nice head of black foam "
"Frasier: Morning. "
"Martin: Well you were home late last night. "
"Frasier: I had dinner with a new friend. Bob. "
"Martin: Oh that's right. Have a good time? "
"Frasier: Hardly. The man talks endlessly on subjects that are of no interest to anyone but him. "
"Martin: Gee. I can't imagine what that's like. "
"Frasier: Oh Dad. He took me to this God-awful barbecue place. All they serve is huge platters of charred greasy beef. The only sound you can hear is the gnawing of meat, the smacking of lips and the clatter of bones hitting the floor. "
"Martin: I can't take it any more. I'm having that fritter "
"Daphne: If you don't like this man why did you have dinner with him? "
"Frasier: Well I was going to tell him that I didn't want to see him anymore but you see it's a bit more delicate than just that. The problem is he's in a wheel chair. "
"Daphne: So what? If you don't like him you don't like him. "
"Frasier: Well I know that. It's just that I'd hate to have him think it was just because of the chair. "
"Daphne: I have worked with the disabled for over 10 years now. And if it's one thing I've learned they don't want special treatment. "
"Martin: Oh I forgot to bring in the paper. Daphne would you get it? My leg's just aching and throbbing "
"Frasier: I'll get it. You know, Daphne, you're right? I was kind of a coward wasn't I? Well, at least I got through the evening. "
"Bob: Here's your paper Buddy "
"Frasier: Bob you're here. Did we have plans? "
"Bob: No. I was in the neighbourhood. Just thought I'd stop by. "
"Frasier: Did I mention where I lived? I'm astonishingly sure I didn't. "
"Bob: You'd be amazed what you can find out with computers today. Anyway – brought bagels, poppy seeds, pumpernickel, rye, sesame, onion, garlic. 'Cos after all breakfast is the most important meal of the day. Hey-ho you must be Martin. You're Daphne. "
"Martin: And you must be Bob. "
"Bob: That's me. Bob Same forwards as backwards. "
"Roz: Got some messages. Bob. Bob. And…oh look…here's one from Bob. "
"Frasier: 2 weeks and 45 phone calls. Can't we just get an unlisted number? "
"Roz: They sort of frown on that with call-in shows. Frasier – you've got to do something about Bob. "
"Frasier: I know Roz. I'm working up to it. "
"Roz: You know the longer you put it off the worse he's going to feel when you finally tell him. "
"Frasier: Yes I know that. I'm a psychiatrist. I'm quite capable of dealing with difficult problems in a sensitive mature fashion……Wait Did you hear that? That squeak "
"Roz: What squeak? "
"Frasier: He's here. It's Bob "
"Roz: I don't hear anything. "
"Frasier: Oh that's right. Only dogs and I can hear it. "
"Roz: Frasier, you're being paranoid. "
"Frasier: It's the sound of his chair. I'd know it anywhere. "
"Roz: Hi Bob. "
"Bob: Knock Knock Roz. Frasier around? "
"Roz: You just missed him. "
"Bob: Too bad. I got great news. I checked out that vacancy in his apartment building and guess who's gonna be neighbours? "
"Bob: What was that? "
"Roz: Feedback. This equipment's old and pathetic "
"Bob: Well maybe I can catch Frasier back at his place…correction, our place. "
"Roz: Bye Bob. "
"Bob: Bye Roz. "
"Roz: OK he's gone. You can come out now. "
"Frasier: No he's not. He's never really gone "
"Roz: So Bob's gonna be your new neighbour? Well, break out the butane there every Barbecue day "
"Frasier: NO NO He's not going to move into my building. I won't allow it. I'm going to talk to him Roz. Listen, I could use your advice. You've broken up with a lot of people. What do you find to be the most effective thing to say? "
"Roz: I love you and I want to have your baby. "
"Frasier: Good, I've got my fallback. "
"Frasier: Ooh Niles, Niles. I need to talk. Bob's meeting me here……this isn't my usual. "
"Niles: Well it's not for you. It's for my friend. "
"Frasier: That man is your friend? "
"Niles: Yep. We share thoughts, feelings. We talk about the arts, current events. Today we're just…hangin' "
"Niles: There you are. "
"Ralph: Thanks. "
"Niles: My pleasure. "
"Ralph: You know, I can't stay long. I've got 4 more pools to clean today besides yours and I'm gonna to lose sunlight. "
"Niles: You know, Ralph, I was thinking that in many ways my profession is a lot like yours. I start out skimming the surface of the human psyche. Then I plunge ever deeper into the murky undercurrents, adding chemicals when necessary. "
"Ralph: …There's a lot of leaves this year "
"Bob: I'm glad you called. I was starting to get self-conscious here. It seems like I'm always the one calling or stopping by or suggesting dinner or movies or shopping for hats. Oh I got you a beaut "
"Frasier: Bob. You really shouldn't have. "
"Bob: I knew you'd like it, neighbour. "
"Frasier: About that Bob. Have you actually signed a lease yet? "
"Bob: No. Why? "
"Frasier: Well, we need to talk. "
"Bob: Whoa. If you were a woman I'd swear you were dumping me. "
"Ralph: Blue one's nice. "
"Niles: Mmm. I'm just concerned that blue might be a bit overbearing on a couch of that size. Although it might complement that Killin rug I was telling you about. What do you think? "
"Ralph: I live in my van "
"Niles: So you'd probably go for colours that add the illusion of space? "
"Ralph: You know, Dr. Crane to be perfectly honest, when you asked if I wanted coffee – I thought you were gonna bring me one. "
"Niles: Duly noted Ralph. Next week you can go back to drinking from the hose. "
"Frasier: You see I just don't think there's a basis between us for a sound friendship. Neither of us should feel bad about it. "
"Bob: That's easy for you to say. You're not the one being rejected. "
"Frasier: No, no. I'm not rejecting you. Truth is you're pleasant. You're charming. "
"Bob: Frasier, I'm an adult here. At least respect me enough to tell me what it is you don't like about me. "
"Frasier: Well all right, all right. We have absolutely nothing in common. You talk on endlessly about subjects that I have no interest in. You call me all the time. Frankly you're suffocating me "
"Bob: Wow. I don't know what to say. I wish you'd said something sooner. "
"Frasier: I wanted to. Frankly I was afraid you'd think it was because of the…you know… "
"Bob: The what? "
"Frasier: The wheelchair. "
"Bob: Why would I think that? "
"Frasier: I don't know. I just wanted you to know that. "
"Bob: I wish it did have to do with the chair. "
"Frasier: I beg your pardon. "
"Bob: Well, if the chair were your problem that would make you a jerk. This way, I'm the jerk. "
"Frasier: Well, I wouldn't say that. "
"Bob: Come on, you just did. You just said I'm boring and obnoxious. Who knows people better than you? You can keep the hat. "
"Frasier: Bob, wait, please. I've got to level with you. Truth is I find nothing wrong with you. I was just ashamed to admit it. It is the chair. "
"Bob: What? "
"Frasier: I think frankly that you are wonderful company. Wildly stimulating. Your hobbies are so fascinating. You have a sense of style that really, I mean, doesn't compare to anyone's. It's just me. I feel petty and small about it but I can't get past the chair. I'm sorry Bob. Please. [Frasier gets up to leave] I'm sorry. This is goodbye. "
"Bob: I don't believe this. You don't want to be my friend 'cos I'm in a wheelchair. "
"Waitress: What? That's the worst thing I've ever heard "
"Frasier: Look. You don't understand. "
"Bob: What's not to understand. You just said flat out – my chair repulses you "
": What kind of a person does that? "
"Frasier: Well… "
": I've got a birthmark on my back. I guess we can't be friends either "
"Frasier: People please. Frankly this doesn't concern any of you. "
"Bob: When I think about all the gifts I gave you. All the barbecue sauce – Hot 'n' Spicy, Tex Mex, Mesquite, Teriyaki, Honey Mustard… "
"Frasier: Oh For God's sake Bob – put a sock in it. "
": We were just on our way to dinner. Would you like to join us? "
"Bob: I'd love to. "
"Bob: So. You guys like barbecue? "
": Yeah. Who doesn't? "
"Niles: Are these wing tips too busy with these pants? "
"Frasier: Well, yes. They're a bit frenzied. Perhaps a woven lace would tone down the glitz. "
"Niles: Might have to go overseas for that. "
"Frasier: No, not at all. You can get them downtown. "
"Niles: Well, who shops downtown anymore? "
"Frasier: Well I do for one… "

"Joe: Morning. "
"Daphne: Morning? Oh my God, Joe, get up Get up You were supposed to be out of here hours ago. You promised me that after we did the deed you'd be on your merry way. "
"Joe: I was. "
"Daphne: Get dressed. We've got to get you out of here before Dr. Crane gets up. [Daphne opens her bedroom door and takes a look outside] Oh, no. I smell coffee. They're already up "
"Joe: Now don't worry. I'll just lay low until the two of them... Oh my God, it's nine o'clock. I'm a half- hour late for work. "
"Daphne: Just give me a minute. I'll get rid of them. "
"Joe: Where's my underwear? "
"Daphne: Eddie, get back here "
"Frasier: Good morning. "
"Martin: Maybe for you. I just spent five minutes trying to button these pants. That stupid dryer shrunk another pair on me. "
"Frasier: Dad. Before you blame the dryer, have you ever considered stepping on the old bathroom scales? "
"Martin: Oh, what's the point? That thing's been ten pounds off for weeks. "
"Frasier: Daphne? "
"Daphne: Oh. Good morning, Dr. Crane. Sorry I overslept. Well, time we all got our day started. I'll just clear these dishes away. "
"Martin: Wait, I wasn't finished with that yet. "
"Daphne: Whoops. Sorry about that. "
"Frasier: Daphne, I wasn't quite finished with that toast either. "
"Daphne: Oh, now, we can't have you running off to your squash game on a full stomach. "
"Frasier: Yes – how many championship matches have been marred by the heartbreak of toast cramp? "
"Daphne: Don't you have that Doctor's appointment? "
"Martin: Yes, but it's not for 20 minutes yet. What's going on here? Why are you giving us the bum's rush? "
"Daphne: Bum's rush Oh, I just love the American vernacular. So cute. So quick. So long "
"Martin: Better get my wallet first. Damn pants You know – you spend fifteen dollars on a good pair of pants - you expect them to be shrink resistant. "
"Frasier: Well, Dad, when you pay that kind of money what you're really paying for is the designer name "
"Joe: Gotta go. I'm so late. "
"Daphne: Oh hurry, hurry, hurry "
"Joe: I'll call you tonight. "
"Daphne: OK. Bye. "
"Frasier: Oh Hello Joe. "
"Joe: Hi Dr. Crane. I just came by to give Daphne a kiss. "
"Joe: And drop off these shoes. Here "
"Daphne: Oh, thank you. "
"Frasier: Well. Can anyone think of anything to make this moment a bit more awkward than it already is? "
"Frasier: Thank you, Eddie "
"Niles: Isn't that Dirk and Gabby Bindercott? "
"Frasier: Friends of yours? "
"Niles: Mmm. Filthy rich. Timber money. In their case it really does grow on trees Dirk Gabby Oh, Dirk? "
"Dirk: Hello, Niles. "
"Niles: Dirk Bindercott – my brother Dr. Frasier Crane. "
"Dirk: Ah – I've heard your program. "
"Frasier: Well – I've seen your wife. "
"Dirk: So Niles – I suppose I'll see you at the benefit on Sunday. I know Maris is coming. "
"Niles: Yes, Sunday. Which benefit is Sunday? I have so many benefits... on Sunday. "
"Dirk: The ho-down for the homeless. You were invited? "
"Niles: The ho-down? Yippee-kai-yes "
"Dirk: Must be Gabby. "
"Niles: Certainly sounds like her. "
"Dirk: See you Sunday. "
"Niles: Yes. Till Sunday. "
"Niles: I wasn't invited. "
"Frasier: Niles, it's one party. "
"Niles: Yes, but when you're off the A-list for one party you're off for all of them. From now on I'll be relegated to B-list charity events. Grubby little theatre companies and last year's diseases. "
"Frasier: This often happens in these cases when two people separate – their friends choose one spouse over the other. Surely they chose Maris because she's better connected and has more money than you do. "
"Niles: Exactly which part of that was meant to ease my pain? "
"Frasier: Niles, I just think you're overreacting. "
"Niles: Oh wait, wait. I know what happened. My invitation just got lost in the mail. No – it's not so far fetched. It could have been missorted... or a stamp could have fallen off... or it could have been stolen by my mail carrier. Ho-downs are catnip to postal workers "
"Roz: Well I'd ask you to explain that but then you would "
"Niles: I'm going to check with the post office. You know – I heard a story on the news the other day about a man who bought a piano at auction and when he went to tune it he found a 40-year-old unmailed letter under the sounding board. "
"Frasier: Perhaps we should contact Feronte and Tisha (sp.??) – see if they have your invitation? "
"Niles: Poke fun now. We'll see who feels foolish this Sunday when I'm sipping champagne atop a mechanical bull "
"Roz: Cappuccino, please. "
"Frasier: Roz, I want to get your take on something. "
"Roz: What? "
"Frasier: Well. Daphne and Joe are having sex in my apartment and it leaves me in a rather awkward position. "
"Roz: Doing what? Bending over to look through the keyhole? Oh Frasier, come on, what is the big deal? "
"Frasier: Well, let's just say that I'm sitting there listening to music, reading a book... and Daphne and Joe are 'back there.' "
"Roz: So? "
"Frasier: Well, it just makes me uncomfortable. I'm going to ask Daphne not to sleep with Joe in the house anymore. Is that too...? "
"Roz: Amish? "
"Frasier: I was going to say selfish "
"Roz: Oh, let's see. Please Daphne – don't have sex. It disturbs my reading No, that's not too selfish. "
"Frasier: Well, I just don't think a man should be uncomfortable in his own home. How am I supposed to relax when every giggle, every noise makes me... you know...? "
"Roz: Picture it? "
"Frasier: Of course not. Don't be ridiculous. The very idea. "
"Roz: You're picturing it right now, aren't you? "
"Frasier: Well, you made me. "
"TO: "
"Martin: Hey, Fras. "
"Frasier: Hey, Dad. Is Daphne in? "
"Martin: Yeah, and if you have any sense you'll pretend that nothing happened this morning. "
"Frasier: Ah, yes. Denial. The sort of advice I'd expect from a man whose driver's license still lists his hair colour as brown. "
"Martin: It was until you came back to town "
"Frasier: Daphne. I think we need to discuss what happened this morning. "
"Daphne: It's been bothering me all day. It was entirely my fault. "
"Frasier: No, no. I share the blame. We never did have a formal discussion about the rules of the house, especially when it comes to... you know... "
"Daphne: I do want to apologise for any embarrassment I may have caused. You see, we can't go to Joe's because he's still building his house and he sleeps on a friend's couch. But I can assure you it will never happen again. "
"Frasier: Well, then our business is concluded. Meeting adjourned. "
"Daphne: The next time Joe spends the night, I'll notify you well in advance. "
"Frasier: Daphne. I was just reviewing the minutes of our last meeting. There seems to be some confusion. "
"Daphne: Oh? "
"Frasier: You see, my quibble is not with the lack of notification. I am just not comfortable with you and Joe sleeping together under my roof. "
"Daphne: Oh, I see. I'm sorry about that, but it is my room, isn't it? "
"Frasier: Oh yes, yes. And I want you to feel comfortable living here. "
"Daphne: I suppose it's more important for you to feel comfortable because, as you said, it is your roof. "
"Frasier: Oh. Thank you for understanding. "
"Daphne: Not at all. Joe and I are going away for the weekend but first thing Monday I'm going to start looking for me own place. "
"Frasier: Guess who? Daphne... em... I don't want you entertaining here but I also don't want you to move out. "
"Daphne: Oh, I see. So you want me to stay, but just not have a personal life? "
"Frasier: Well... "
"Daphne: No, no. That works out fine for me. I'll just spend all day waiting on you and your father, then in the evenings retire to me room, wrap meself in an Afghan and wait for the morning. And if my whimpering gets too loud for you – you can just have me fixed like Eddie "
"Frasier: That is not what I meant. This is difficult for both of us, Daphne. I have to express my feelings. I also don't want to lose you. You're very important to me and my father. "
"Daphne: That's why my solution is best. I'll still be here during the day to take care of your father but nights and weekends I'll just go home to my own place. On top of which you can turn this room back into your beautiful study you used to have. "
"Frasier: Well – I suppose, what other choice do we have? "
"Daphne: Of course it'll be a period of adjustment for all of us... "
"Daphne: ...I know how much you two care about me and consider me part of the family but... You're picturing your study right now, aren't you? "
"Frasier: Well, you made me "
"TO: "
"Martin: She's such a groovy lady "
"Frasier: Morning, Dad. "
"Martin: Oh, morning. "
"Frasier: You seen the phone? "
"Martin: Oh, I probably left it in my room again. Sorry. Hey, I'm making breakfast Burritos. You want one? "
"Frasier: I'll passo "
"Martin: Suit yourself. "
"Frasier: Dad. Whatever happened to the silk pajamas I bought you? "
"Martin: Oh, Frasier, they're too la-dee-da for me. Besides, they shrank Whoa – there go my tater-tots. You want a pile? "
"Frasier: Not that I don't enjoy a 'pile' of breakfast as much as the next guy but I still think no. Dad, are you planning on going around like that all weekend? "
"Martin: Yeah, why not? Daphne's off on her little trip. It's just us guys. Besides I've been wearing pants round here for three years. Enough "
"Frasier: I see. Look Dad, I just have to do this [puts an apron on over Martin] "
"Martin: All right. Now, listen. It's no big deal but I couldn't find the remote control for the TV last night. Now I thought we agreed that its place was on that table next to my chair. "
"Frasier: What was it like in the old days when you actually had to get up to change the channel? "
"Martin: It was hell "
"Martin: You expecting someone? "
"Frasier: The contractor. I'm getting an estimate on restoring my study. "
"Martin: Why don't you use Joe? "
"Frasier: I think Joe's done enough work in that room, thank you "
"Frasier: Henry. Thank you for coming on such short notice. "
"Henry: No sweat. "
"Frasier: I'll just show you the room. [leads Henry towards Daphne's room passing Martin at the table on the way] Oh, this is my father. Don't get up Like a cup of coffee? "
"Henry: That'd be great. "
"Frasier: Fine. Look, the room is right down the hall there to the right. I'll meet you there. "
"Henry: OK. "
"Frasier: Oh, Dad. This is a small thing but you left the sponge in the sink again. "
"Martin: So? "
"Frasier: Well, as I mentioned last evening, if it stays wet, not only does it begin to smell but it becomes a breeding ground for bacteria. "
"Martin: So? "
"Frasier: So. If I were to say wipe up that salsa that you spilled on the table just now I would be leaving behind bacteria such as salmonella, lysteria, flagella. Now wouldn't that bother you? "
"Martin: Yeah, I guess you're right – it would bother me. I wouldn't dream of touching that sponge now "
"Frasier: Ah, yes. Our own foul-breathed little handy wet "
"Martin: You've been leaving lights on in the apartment all weekend. You know what that does to the electric bill? "
"Frasier: Suppose there's a nuclear power plant they had to build to keep that television on day and night? "
"Martin: You moved my chair again, didn't you? "
"Frasier: No "
"Martin: Oh well, maybe Eddie did it. Eddie, you move my chair? 'Cause Frasier said he didn't do it and Frasier never messes around with my stuff. "
"Frasier: All right, I moved your damn chair. The way you have it turned ruins the symmetry of the room. The sight line loses all flow. "
"Martin: Oh, the sight line. And here I thought it was for some dumb reason. "
"Frasier: Would you get Eddie off of the couch, or else it's down through the garbage chute for the thrill ride of his life "
"Frasier: Well, howdy partner. "
"Niles: Save your snippy remarks. "
"Frasier: Fair enough. Say, am I crazy or is there a bright golden haze on the meadow? "
"Niles: Stop it. I'm in the middle of a social crisis. I just drove to the ho-down for the homeless assuming that Maris had simply neglected to forward my invitation. Well, not only was I not on the guest list but Nelson, the parking attendant, said he missed me at 'The Luau for Lupus.' Now it is official. I'm a social outcast. "
"Frasier: Oh Niles, why do you even care about those people? In your hour of need they pretend you don't even exist. They treat you like you're a leper, a non-person. "
"Niles: But I really, really like them. I know, I know – it makes me sound pathetic. But I'm newly separated. These people have been my social circle for ten years. Frasier – they're my tribe. "
"Frasier: Well, I hate to break this to you, 'Waltzes With Snobs,' but they have left you on the mountaintop to die "
"Martin: Now Niles, maybe your friends wanted to invite you but they probably thought you'd be upset seeing Maris there. "
"Niles: Of course. You're absolutely right. "
"Frasier: Oh, that's ridiculous. "
"Niles: Oh, why are you so negative? These people do care about me. "
"Frasier: Oh fine, very well. Why don't you just call them? Prove to me I'm wrong. "
"Niles: Nothing would give me greater pleasure. Where's your phone? "
"Martin: It's in my bedroom. "
"Frasier: Where else would it be? [speaking to Niles as he goes through to Martin's bedroom] And Dad's electric shaver is in the kitchen. You see, all our appliances are on an adventure this weekend. "
"Martin: Well, are you proud of yourself, stirring things up? Why didn't you just let him think his friends were doing him a favour? "
"Frasier: Ah, yes. The Martin Crane approach. Better living through denial "
"Martin: You did the same thing with Daphne. You couldn't just pretend that nothing was going on back there. "
"Frasier: Dad, I'm a psychiatrist. I don't pretend. I confront. I resolve. "
"Martin: Oh yeah, you really resolved this. Now she's moving out. You know, I swear you just go looking for trouble. "
"Frasier: Oh, that is so untrue. "
"Frasier: AND PERHAPS YOU CAN EXPLAIN THIS "
"Martin: A grown man's obsession with a sponge? No, I can't "
"Frasier: For the last two days I've asked you again and again as politely as I can to wring out the sponge. But you don't even have the consideration to respect my feelings. "
"Martin: Because your feelings are stupid "
"Frasier: But they're my feelings And important to me And because of that you should have the courtesy to respect them. "
"Martin: Just like you respect my feelings when I asked you not to move my chair. "
"Frasier: Oh, that makes no sense at all. "
"Martin: Oh, all right. [gets up out of his chair and takes the sponge out of Frasier's hand and goes through to the kitchen] You want me to dry that sponge? I'll dry that sponge [Martin puts the sponge into the toaster] Give it about a minute. "
"Frasier: Oh, that's mature. "
"Martin: Oh, boy – you know what a tortured little world you live in? Newspapers strewn all over the place. Sponge germs coming after you. It's a wonder you can sleep at night "
"Frasier: Oh, my dreams get me by. Like the one where I strap you in your chair and run around the house turning on all the lights... "
"Frasier: ...even in the rooms I'm nowhere near. Boy, that electric meter must really be spinning now "
"Daphne: Evening, all. Did you boys have a nice weekend? "
"Martin: Barrel of laughs "
"Daphne: Well, I had the loveliest time. Hey – Off We found this little bed-and-breakfast right up the coast. [moves the remote control to Martin's table] I talked my decision over with Joe, and he agreed it really is the best thing for everyone. Of course I'll still be here during the day to help your father with his exercises. But nights and weekends it'll just be you two carefree bachelors getting into trouble together. [puts one of the lights off before heading into the kitchen] I'm usually just underfoot around here anyway. [puts the newspapers in the bin then wrings the sponge out] So you see, my decision is best for everyone. Well, I've had a long weekend, so good night. "
"Frasier: Night, Daphne. "
"Martin: Frasier. "
"Frasier: What? "
"Martin: You know how an Oreo has that soft creamy filling between two hard cookies? That's what keeps them together? "
"Frasier: See your point, Dad. "
"Martin: Daphne's kind of the centre. "
"Frasier: I'll go and talk to her. "
"Martin: Now, you and me, we'd be the cookie part. "
"Frasier: I get it "
"Frasier: May I come in? "
"Daphne: Yes, of course. "
"Frasier: Thank you, Daphne. Daphne... er... you can't go. You have to stay. I've only just recently realised how important you are to us. You see, if you go, Dad and I will kill each other. I'm not just tossing out hyperbole here. I'm speaking in the most literal sense. Dad and I – both dead Only he'll be lying there with a bacteria-ridden sponge protruding from his mouth like a bloated tongue. You don't really want that on your conscience, do you? "
"Daphne: No, of course not. Truth is, I do still think of this place as my home. But I know you'd never be comfortable knowing Joe and I were... "
"Frasier: I'd be willing to try. "
"Daphne: I know you better than that. It'll bother you and we'll both be miserable. "
"Frasier: Why can't I get past this? Oh, it'd just be easier if I could be like my father pretending you weren't in here making love. "
"Daphne: Making love? Is that what you think we were doing? "
"Frasier: Yes, of course. "
"Daphne: Oh no. There was nothing like that going on in here. "
"Frasier: Really? Seems rather implausible. I'd like to believe that and believe me I really do want to... er... how can I? "
"Daphne: Well, how could Joe and I make love? What with... er... Joe's war injury? "
"Frasier: I didn't even know Joe was a soldier. What war would that be? "
"Daphne: The Falkland Islands. "
"Frasier: But that was a British conflict and Joe's not... "
"Daphne: His parents have a summerhouse there "
"Frasier: Oh, that's very unfortunate. Having a summerhouse in a war zone. But how-? "
"Daphne: He was kicked by a sheep. "
"Frasier: A sheep? "
"Daphne: Yes, a sheep – spooked by an air raid siren. Work with me. "
"Frasier: [now clearly pretending to believe whatever he is told – no matter how insane it is] Oh, I see. So, what you're saying is that Joe... "
"Daphne: Can't. "
"Frasier: Ah. Well, I suppose that changes everything. "
"Daphne: Yes, I suppose it does. But just so as we're clear - even though there's no actual lovemaking, Joe and I can on occasion, say, read poems to each other in here at night? "
"Frasier: As long as you don't read too loudly. "
"Frasier: She's staying. Turns out they're sleeping together but not having sex. See, they can't have sex because of an injury Joe suffered when kicked by a spooked sheep during an air raid while his family were vacationing in the Falkland Islands during the war. "
"Niles: Well, Dad was right. They are my real friends. It was all just a misunderstanding. Apparently the social chairman's dog ate my invitation. And the poor animal had to go to the vet and with all the confusion they forgot to send me another, and when I offered my new address for next year's party, they said, 'no need – we'll see you around.' "
"Martin: [joining into the spirit of the now-blatant lying as he tugs at his trousers] I'm going to start wearing sweat pants. That damned drier again. Hey, you guys want some cookies? They're reduced fat. "
"Frasier: Really? That means we can eat twice as many. "

"Frasier: Well, we've got about thirty seconds. I think we've got time for one quick call. Hello, Marlene, I'm listening. "
"Marlene: Oh my God, I'm really on? "
"Frasier: Yes, your problem, please... "
"Marlene: Lucky, Lucky, get down. George, get the dog Oh my God, this is so exciting Honey, honey, get the baby. George, get your son OK, OK, here it is, Dr. "
"Crane: if my husband and I don't find some time to have sex soon, I think I'm gonna burst. I may even have to go to a department store and pick up a stranger. Oh, kids Look who's here without calling first, Nana and Pop Pop I'll call you back. "
"Frasier: Well, to all you Marlenes out there, may I suggest that sex with a stranger is not the answer. Why don't you just pack the kids off with Nana and Pop Pop, lock Lucky downstairs in the basement, grab your husband, take him to the sturdiest kitchen table you have, and let the postman ring twice Now, to the rest of my listeners, I'll be off on vacation for the next week, so please tune in to my replacement, the noted podiatrist, Dr Garreth Wooten, who'll be discussing the virtues of his new book, 'Bunions and Blisters and Corns,' Oh My "
"Roz: I hate it when that weird foot freak subs for you. Couldn't you just have Frederick come and visit you here? "
"Frasier: Sorry Roz, the taxi's waiting outside to take me to the airport. "
"Roz: Oh well, have a great time. "
"Frasier: Oh, thanks. "
"Roz: And don't forget to bring me a present "
"Frasier: I'll get you a nice T-shirt from Colonial Williamsburg. "
"Roz: You're taking Frederick to Williamsburg? Eeew "
"Frasier: No, it's a wonderful vacation spot We're going to dip candles, tan leather, churn butter... "
"Roz: Hey, Frederick Crane, you just finished the first grade, what are you going to do now? I'm going to Butterworld "
"Martin: Hey Daphne, bring that laundry over here, will you? "
"Daphne: What for? "
"Martin: Well, I was just reading about an intelligence test you can give your dog. You throw a towel over its head and see how long it takes him to shake it off. Eddie "
"Daphne: Oh, and the faster he takes the towel off, the smarter he is? "
"Martin: No, the faster he folds it. All right, they ranked all the dogs and the smartest was a border collie; he did it in seven seconds. All right, come on boy, take it off. Six... seven. OK, the next fastest one was a poodle, I know he's as smart as a poodle. OK, so he's no poodle... he's not a beagle either... or a German shepherd... or a Labrador. Oh, for God's sake, Eddie "
"Daphne: Yes, well, if you ask me, he's refusing to do that trick because he knows if he does it right, you'll have him doing it every time we have company. "
"Martin: Hey, I'll bet you're right [takes the towel off and shakes a finger at Eddie] Nice going, Eddie "
"Daphne: Oh, hello, Dr. Crane. "
"Niles: I appreciate the false cheer, Daphne. But I'm sure you've seen this? Today's society page? "
"Martin: Don't tell me, don't tell me, don't tell me I'm saving it for after dinner "
"Niles: Apparently Maris is going on a three-week cruise. Her friends threw her a bon voyage party. Look at the photo. It's Maris on the arm of Pierson Broadwater. "
"Daphne: Oh, Dr. Crane, look She's just standing there, barely touching him, with only the tiniest bit of a smile on her face "
"Niles: I know, you can practically hear the zing zing zing of her heartstrings "
"Daphne: "
"Martin: Sorry, Niles. "
"Niles: Oh, it gets worse. This morning I spoke to Marta, my ex-maid and current mole. She reports that Broadwater is just the latest in a parade of escorts. The gigolos are swarming around Maris like ants on a Snickers bar "
"Martin: Well, wait a minute, that's good news. If she's seeing a whole bunch of people, that means she's not serious about any one of them. "
"Niles: You think? "
"Martin: Yeah, sure They're probably just her escorts. You know how she loves going to parties. "
"Niles: Yes, and she never liked going anywhere alone. Except to bed. "
"Martin: More good news. And Niles, it wouldn't hurt you to go out a little bit every once in a while too. "
"Niles: If you're suggesting that I start dating, you can save your breath. Women don't exactly find me irresistible. "
"Martin: Oh, come on, Niles, you've had lots of girlfriends. "
"Niles: Oh, let's count. There's Maris... oh no, Dora, my childhood pen pal from Costa Rica... I seem to recall a little girl in the fourth grade who lured me to a stairwell to show me her underpants. "
"Martin: You know, Niles, I think your problem is you still picture yourself as the same geeky kid you were in high school. But you've come a long way since then. And you're not doing yourself any favours sitting home every night. Now just think about it. "
"Daphne: Wine, Dr. Crane? "
"Niles: Well, wouldn't you? "
"TO: "
"Daphne: Oh, give it up, the man had every right to be proud of his dog. "
"Martin: Well, I just don't like show-offs, OK? 'Ginger, catch the frisbee. Ginger, roll over. Ginger, do my taxes' "
"Daphne: Just because Eddie's not good at tricks... "
"Martin: The hell he isn't He just likes the kind that gives him a chance to use his brain Eddie's a thinker "
"Martin: Just watch this. Open the door for him. Now, I've been teaching him the names of all his chew toys. Eddie, get your banana. "
"Martin: Now he's thinking, 'which one's the banana?' [still not moving] Now he's thinking, 'what the heck did I do with my banana?' "
"Daphne: Now he's thinking, 'which one's the emergency button?' "
"Martin: Come on "
"Daphne: Oh, Dr Crane "
"Niles: Hello. I let myself in, I hope that's all right. "
"Martin: Fine. What's up? "
"Niles: Oh, I just stopped by to ask you a question. Are you free Saturday night? "
"Martin: Sure "
"Niles: Well, I'm not I have a date "
"Martin: Oh "
"Daphne: Oh Bravo, Dr. Crane "
"Martin: Good for you Who is she? "
"Niles: Marjorie Nash, the 'Fruit On The Bottom' yogurt heiress. I bumped into her at the Frye museum. Before I knew it, your advice was thundering in my ears. I found myself asking her out. We'll be attending our club's annual winter dance, the 'Snow Ball' "
"Martin: Good for you "
"Daphne: What's she like? "
"Niles: Well, she's terribly haughty and rumours persist about her husband's death. But still, a date's a date "
"Daphne: Snow Ball? Sounds very glamourous. "
"Martin: I didn't know you could dance "
"Niles: Oh, I can't. "
"Niles: Oh, dear. You don't think she'll want me to? I've taken Maris to dozens of these things, she's never once asked to dance... of course, Maris dislikes public displays of rhythm. Oh, this is terrible My first date's a miserable failure before it even begins. I'll just have to cancel. "
"Daphne: All you need are a few dancing lessons. Why, I'd be happy to give you some. "
"Niles: You would? "
"Daphne: Yeah Growing up, I used to practise all the time with my brother Billy - the ballroom dancer? "
"Niles: I couldn't prevail upon you like that, it would be too much trouble. We'll have to move this "
"Niles: OK, now push the chair back Or not. "
"Daphne: Alright, we'll start with the box step. "
"Niles: Box step... "
"Daphne: It's very simple. Take my hand like so, and your other hand goes around my waist. Now, start with your left foot. "
"Niles: OK, which one? "
"Daphne: Oh, hush Step towards me, then bring your right foot forward-and-over, and slide the left over to meet it. Then the right foot goes back, the left back-and-over, and the right slides next to it. And that's it All right, once again. A one-two- Oh "
"Niles: Sorry. "
"Daphne: -three, a two-two-three, a three-two-three, a four-two three... "
"Niles: This is boring yet difficult. "
"Martin: Aw, there's no trick to dancing. It's just a matter of coordination. Hell, if you can ride a bike, or skip rope, or kick a ball, you can certainly... "
"Daphne: Alright, once again. A one-two- Oh-three... "
"Daphne: You're really doing very well, Dr. Crane. Earlier you seemed a bit tense. You've really relaxed now though, haven't you? "
"face: he's in a dream world of his own. Martin comes "
"Martin: Hey, you two are looking pretty sharp. "
"Daphne: Well, I think we're ready to move on to the samba. Eddie, fetch me a samba tape. Xavier Cougat. [Eddie just stares] Now he's thinking, 'the later Hollywood stuff, or the early New York recordings?' "
"Martin: Now guess what I'm thinking. "
"Daphne: I'll get it myself. "
"Martin: Well, I'm going to hit the hay. "
"Niles: Good-night -- bend-and- turn – see-you-in-the-morning – spin-and-dip -- [cell phone rings] there's-my-phone -- flip-and-push – Niles-Crane. Oh, Marjorie. How are you? Oh, what a shame. Well, er, no no it's alright, there'll be other dances. No, no, I understand completely. Take care. Guess I won't be needing those dancing lessons. "
"Martin: I guess not. I'm sorry, son. "
"Daphne: I couldn't find any Cougie, but this'll do "
"Daphne: Alright now, in the samba you have to hold me a little closer. You ready? "
"Niles: Daphne, there's one thing I wanted to mention... "
"Daphne: Yeah? "
"Niles: I'm a dancer, a dancer dances "
"Daphne: Here's my dancing partner. Hello, Fred "
"Niles: Hello, Ginger "
"Daphne: It's a little joke we have "
"Niles: Look Daphne, I got two new CDs today. Tonight we master the mambo and the conga. I can feel myself growing a pencil-thin moustache just saying that. "
"Martin: You're having more lessons tonight? "
"Daphne: Oh, yes He's going to be the best dancer at the ball. I'll just go get us some coffees. "
"Martin: Why didn't you tell her your date had cancelled? You don't need more lessons. "
"Niles: I wanted to, but she's just having so much fun "
"Martin: Come on, Niles, you think I don't see the way you look at Daphne? "
"Niles: What are you implying? "
"Martin: You know damn well what I'm implying. Take my word for it, you're sticking a fork in the toaster here. "
"Niles: Well, my muffin's stuck Besides, what's the harm in a few dance lessons? "
"Martin: It's nighttime. You're alone. The music's on. You've got your arms around her. You'll end up saying something you can't take back. "
"Niles: I have no intention of saying anything. "
"Martin: No one ever does. Take my word for it. When I was separated from your mother, there was this pretty coroner in the city morgue. I always had a bit of a crush on her. So whenever we'd find a dead body, I'd yell out, 'OK boys, I'll take it from here' So one night, I invited her down to the corner bar. "
"Niles: Coroners have their own bars? "
"Martin: No, corner, Niles, the corner bar Anyway, we had a few drinks, the lights were low, Sinatra on the jukebox. Before I knew it, it just all came pouring out of me. I told her how I felt. I mean, I knew the second it was out of my mouth that it was a mistake. She let me down easy but we still had to go on seeing each other all the time. It sure was no fun going to the morgue after that "
"Daphne: So, what time are we starting your lessons tonight, Dr. Crane? "
"Niles: Actually, that won't be necessary. I just got a call from Marjorie. Something's come up. I won't be going to the ball. "
"Daphne: Oh. Well, I'm sorry. "
"Niles: It's quite all right, and thank you for all your help. "
"Daphne: It seems such a shame to waste all that hard work... I hope you don't think I'm being too forward, but what would you say about our going to the dance together? "
"Martin: Now, now, he's already taken up too much of your time, Daphne, he couldn't ask you to do that. "
"Daphne: No, but it would be as much fun for me as it would be for him I'd love an elegant evening out What do you say, Dr. Crane? "
"Martin: Tell her what you say, Dr. Crane. "
"Niles: Pick you up at seven? "
"Daphne: Great "
"TO: "
"Martin: No, Eddie that's not your banana, that's Mr. Pig. Listen to the "
"difference: pig, banana Pig, banana Pig, banana Ah, I still love you, you little pinhead. Go sit down. "
"opens: Frasier is back from his vacation. "
"Martin: Oh Frasier, am I glad you're back Listen, all sorts of.... "
"Frasier: Dad, please, please I have just spent the most wonderful six days with Frederick. I am technically still on vacation till ten a.m. tomorrow. "
"Martin: Yeah, but listen... "
"Frasier: Bup-bup-bup-bup-bup Dad, I do not care to know how hard Daphne made you exercise, or about the boring foreign film Niles made you sit through, or about the progress of Eddie's on-again, off-again romance with the ottoman "
"Martin: But you don't understand... "
"Frasier: Dad, please For all intents and purposes, I am not here. "
"Daphne: That'll be my date Ooh, I'm so excited, this is me first ball Oh, I hope he likes my dress... "
"Frasier: Daphne? "
"Daphne: Hello, Dr. Crane, welcome back "
"Daphne: Hello "
"Niles: Wow "
"Daphne: Ohhh, "
"Frasier: Niles? "
"Niles: Oh, Frasier, you're back Well, our carriage awaits. "
"Martin: And you'd better get her home at a decent hour, I'm gonna be waiting up for you "
"Daphne: Oh, Mr. Crane "
"Frasier: What the hell was that? "
"Martin: Eddie, did you hear sumpin'? Can't be Frasier, he's still on vacation "
"Frasier: Dad, what was that? Dad, will you stop kidding around? Was that a date? Dad "
"TO: "
"Daphne: Oh, Dr. Crane, it's so beautiful "
"Niles: Just for tonight, could you call me Niles? "
"Daphne: You know, when I was at school I knew a boy named Niles. I called him Niley. "
"Niles: Just for tonight, could you call me Niles? "
"Niles: You're a vision... everyone's staring at you "
"Daphne: Well, you look awfully handsome yourself... Niles. "
"Niles: Would you like some champagne? "
"Daphne: Oh, that would be lovely. "
"Niles: Be back in a moment. "
"Niles: Two champagnes, tout de suite. "
"Lacey: Niles, dear How are you "
"Niles: Just fine, thanks. "
"Lacey: Andrew, say hello to Niles. "
"Andrew: Haven't seen you for ages. Feel just terrible about you and Maris. "
"Lacey: Oh yes, we were just devastated. Positively everyone's talking about it. "
"Niles: Oh, and how is positively everyone? "
"Lacey: Devastated. We were just saying that to Maris, when we ran into her and Bradley Paxton at the Breever's Cup. "
"Andrew: No, she was with Calvin Oldi at the Breever's Cup. "
"Lacey: Well, it's so hard to keep track anyway. Niles, if there's anything we can do to cheer you up? Just let us know... "
"Niles: Perhaps a murder-suicide pact. "
"Daphne: Well, they weren't very nice "
"Niles: Well, everyone in our set seems to have this idea that while Maris is out living the high life, I'm sitting at home, crushed and lonely. "
"Daphne: Yeah, well, never mind those gossipy twits. Tonight, you're all mine. Now take me in your arms, Niles, and let the music carry us away... "
"Conductor: Thank you, we'll be back in ten minutes. "
"TO: "
"later: Niles & Daphne are waltzing together. "
"Daphne: I can't remember when I've had a better time. I'm on Cloud Nine "
"Niles: I'd have to look down to see Cloud Nine [leads her back to the table] Daphne, I must tell you again, that is an exquisite gown. "
"Daphne: Oh, thanks It was way out of my price range, but did you ever see something and say, 'I just have to have it?' "
"Niles: Where's my chair? "
"Daphne: "
"Niles: Oh, you never taught me a tango "
"Daphne: Oh, you'll love it It's perfect for you This is a passionate, full-blooded dance that rose up from the slums of Buenos Aires. "
"Niles: Well, the parallels between me and an unemployed gaucho aside, I think we probably should just sit this one out. "
"Daphne: Oh, nonsense There's only one rule in the "
"tango: our bodies must be in continuous contact, with not a sliver of daylight between us. "
"Niles: I can do that. "
"Daphne: Stop Don't be afraid Daphne won't let anything happen to you. "
"Niles: I don't think- "
"Daphne: Don't think Just feel. [holds his lapels and seductively pulls him forward] You're an Argentine slum- dweller. You have no house, no car, you don't know where your next meal is coming from. But none of that matters. Because tonight... [they join hands and cast their eyes toward some imaginary moon] we have the tango "
"Niles: Oh mama, I've got it all "
"Daphne: That's it You're dazzling You're brilliant But I feel you're holding back "
"Niles: I am. "
"Daphne: Oh, this is no time for inhibitions "
"Niles: I know. "
"Daphne: Oh. let it out Niles. Let everything out "
"Niles: Oh Daphne, I adore you "
"Daphne: I adore you too "
"Niles: What??? "
"Daphne: I adore you too. "
"Niles: Oh, how I've longed to hear those words "
"Daphne: Oh, how I've longed to say them "
"Niles: You're beautiful You're a goddess "
"Daphne: I don't ever want this moment to end "
"Niles: Then let's not let it "
"table: Andrew is openly gawping at Daphne, "
"Niles: This is the most glorious night of my life. "
"Daphne: Oh, mine too... I bet Maris hasn't done this' He leads her back to the "
"Niles: Oh, Daphne I'm a new man Do you have any idea what I'm feeling? "
"Daphne: Of course I do Your friends look positively dumbstruck. From now on there'll be no more of that 'oh poor Niles' attitude... "
"Niles: Far from it "
"Daphne: I knew you were a good dancer, but I had no idea you were such a good actor "
"Niles: Actor? "
"Daphne: Yeah 'Daphne, you're a goddess, Daphne, I adore you...' We fooled everyone, didn't we? "
"Niles: Oh...oh. We certainly did, didn't we? "
"Daphne: I'm surprised it was so easy "
"Niles: Well, given the right circumstances, anyone can be fooled. "
"Daphne: Ooh What do you say to another dance? "
"Niles: No thanks, it's getting late and I've danced enough. "
"Daphne: Alright, then I'll just go powder my nose and then we'll be off. "
"Claire: Niles? No, no, please. Claire Barnes? I was an associate in your attorney's office. "
"Niles: Oh, yes, Claire. Uh, it's good to see you again. "
"Claire: Well, I heard about you and Maris. And I just wanted to give you my card and tell you you're free to call me anytime. "
"Niles: Oh, thank you, but I'm happy with my attorney. "
"Claire: I meant to go dancing. "
"Daphne: Well, are you ready? "
"Niles: No, I don't think I am. [drops it on the table] "
"Daphne: I beg your pardon? "
"Niles: Er, I mean yes. Uh, let's go. "
"Daphne: Well, we certainly had fun tonight, didn't we? "
"Niles: We certainly did. "
"Daphne: And to think you almost didn't come to the ball You know, it's such a shame when people let fear stop them from trying new things. "
"Niles: Excuse me. "
"Niles: I'm ready now. "
"time: 'Moon Dance' "

"Frasier: This is Dr. Frasier Crane, KACL, 780. "
"Roz: Frasier, that was security. Some woman insisted on seeing you, she just blew right past them. "
"Frasier: Oh, don't panic, Roz — probably just one of my more ardent fans. "
"horror: 'AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH' "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Niles, we've got to talk It's urgent. "
"Niles: Frasier, I'm with a patient "
"Frasier: Oh, I'm sorry. "
"Carr: Is, uh, this about a woman? "
"Frasier: Yes. "
"Carr: Take all the time you need. "
"Niles: Well? "
"Frasier: She's back — the scourge of my existence. "
"Niles: Strange, I usually get some sign when Lilith is in town — dogs forming into packs, blood weeping down the wall. "
"Frasier: I'm talking about... Diane Chambers. "
"Niles: Lucille, send Mr. Carr home. "
"Frasier: She just showed up at the station today. Apparently some play she wrote is being produced here in town. I admit, I just sort of panicked when I saw her, but I think I covered it masterfully. "
"Niles: All right, all right, all right. Well, uh, why do you think you reacted that way? "
"Frasier: Oh, spare me the psychiatrist bit, Niles. That includes putting down the pad In the drawer, Niles "
"Niles: Fine. My first question to you is "
"this: Are you still in love with her? "
"Frasier: No Not in the least It's a ridiculous suggestion. "
"Niles: Seeing as how I have nowhere to write the phrase, 'classic denial,' I'll move on. So, about this woman for whom you have so little feeling that you raced across town and burst into one of my sessions — is there any lingering resentment? "
"Frasier: Over what? "
"Niles: Well, she did leave at the altar. When you told her how that made you feel, was there anything you left unsaid? Any phrase or feeling you wished you had expressed to her? I'm making the assumption here that you did tell her how you felt. "
"Frasier: I sort of did. "
"Niles: 'Sort of' is another one of those phrases that just wants to go in my pad. "
"Frasier: I expressed my distaste for the way I'd been treated, yes. "
"Niles: Frasier, she rejected you in the most debilitating way a man can be rejected. You've got to more than 'sort of' tell her how that felt. "
"Frasier: Well, I can't just tell Diane how awful she made me feel now It's a distant memory for her. I'd feel weak "
"Niles: You have no reason to feel weak. You've moved on in your life too. You have a new career, new wealth, new success. You simply need closure in this one area. "
"Frasier: You know, what you just said made a lot of sense. "
"Niles: You're going to get closure. "
"Frasier: No, that business about my success I tuned you out after that. I'm going to invite Diane over for dinner tonight, and I'm really gonna flaunt my success, really rub her nose in it That'll prove I'm not just some cast-aside that never got over her. Niles, I know it's not psychologically sound. But we're still human. We have to do what feels good sometimes, don't we? "
"Niles: I'd just like to be on the record as saying I'm against it. "
"Frasier: Fine. "
"Niles: You know the path that leads to peace with Diane and you're rejecting it. "
"Frasier: Yes. "
"Niles: I'm washing my hands of the entire matter. "
"Frasier: Wouldn't miss it for the world though, would you? "
"Niles: I'll be there at seven with a cheeky Bordeaux. "
"Frasier: No, no, no. Daphne, I was very specific about this. The mayor's plaque goes on the piano... "
"Frasier: The Otis Klandenning 'Man of the Year Award' goes right over here... "
"Frasier: And my jewel — my SeaBea — goes right here where she can't miss it "
"Daphne: Hmm, that seems a bit subtle. Why don't I just use this to serve the olives? "
"Frasier: Give me that "
"Daphne: I wish someone would just tell me who this woman is, and why we're trying to impress the pants off her. "
"Frasier: She's a one-time Boston barmaid who had a nervous breakdown and ended up in a sanitorium, where I met her, fell for her, and then was so mercilessly rejected by her that to this day there is a sucking chest wound where once there dwelled a heart "
"Frasier: Diane "
"Diane: Hello, Frasier. "
"Frasier: Please. You remember my brother Niles, my father Martin, and this is his health-care worker, Daphne Moon. "
"Diane: What a tasteful abode. "
"Frasier: Well, it's modest in its way. "
"Diane: No, that's what I like about it. After the rambling beach house I've been living in, I'm ready for something smart and efficient. "
"Frasier: White wine, Diane? I'm pouring an '85 Montrachet La Guiche I purchased at auction. "
"Diane: Oh, I always keep a bottle of that open myself. "
"Frasier: Hang this up "
"Diane: Well, Martin, it's been too long. How have you been? "
"Martin: Well, my wife died, I got shot in the hip, and I had to move in with Frasier 'cause I kept falling down in the shower. "
"Diane: Well, you look wonderful Yes, you do "
"Martin: That's the bad one. "
"Diane: Oh Niles, do you remember the last time I was in town and we dined together? You had just started dating this woman — she was the queerest little creature. [Frasier hands her a glass of wine] Thank you. She ate everyone's sorbet, and then she had to lie down in the ladies' lounge while the coat-check girl massaged her abdomen "
"Diane: Oh, I hope I haven't put my foot in it. You and she didn't get married and live happily ever after, did you? "
"Niles: No, can't say as we did. "
"Daphne: Care for an olive? "
"Diane: Oh, thank you. "
"Frasier: These are a Pyreenean taste treat They're handpicked and bottled by Andalusian monks "
"Daphne: You can spit the pits in here. "
"TO: "
"Diane: So, there I was, on the balcony of my Malibu beachhouse, when a pod of whales passed by. I knew I had to commune with these gentle giants, so like a flash, I was on the beach, scrambling to my kayak. But cruel fortune interceded, when, not twenty yards offshore, I suddenly discovered myself entangled in an enormous bed of-of, um— "
"Niles: Sea kelp? "
"Diane: Exactly right, sea kelp "
"Martin: Oh, that's funny — I thought he said 'seek help.' "
"Daphne: So, you haven't told us how you've come to be in Seattle. "
"Diane: Oh, a small theater group has decided to produce a play I've written. "
"Frasier: Which one? "
"Diane: Oh, my most recent work. It's a sort of feminist odyssey, experimental in places, in tone akin to Saroyan, with a soupçon of Gide, and a hearty nod to Clifford Odets "
"Frasier: I meant which theater? "
"Diane: Oh The Roundabout. "
"Martin: That seems appropriate. "
"Frasier: You know, why don't you people just keep talking amongst yourselves? I will go and fetch the profiteroles. They were prepared by the hottest new pastry chef in... oh, what's the use? "
"Niles: I'll help. He always overpowders. "
"Martin: Yeah, I'm sure Old Man Kennedy felt this kind of pride when his boys would go out and play touch football. "
"Niles: Now, Frasier, you know her better than I. Is that what she looks like when she's writhing in envy? "
"Frasier: Oh, shut up. All right, I admit you were right. Before she leaves here tonight, I am going to tell her how much pain she made me feel. [energetically sprinkling sugar on the cakes] The savage truth this time — there will be no sugarcoating it And yes, I am aware of the irony "
"Daphne: Oh, it must be wonderful to see your words come to life like that. "
"Diane: Oh yes. It's a dream come true. "
"Martin: Diane, are you OK? "
"Diane: Yes, I'm fine. Why? "
"Martin: Well, your cheek was kind of twitching. "
"Diane: It was? Oh well, it was probably fatigue. Where were we? "
"Daphne: Oh, I was asking about your play. "
"Diane: Oh, right "
"Martin: There it goes again, the twitch "
"Daphne: That was either a very large twitch or a very small seizure. "
"Diane: You know, I'm not sure how much I really want to talk about my play right now. [twitches even harder, and covers her face with a napkin] Bad luck and all that "
"Frasier: Yes, and we all know what a struggle it is to get Diane to talk about herself. "
"Diane: Oh Frasier, you always could kid How I miss that "
"Frasier: Look, Diane, please, I-I really didn't mean anything by it. I'm sorry— "
"Diane: It's not that It's my whole life, it's ruined "
"Frasier: Niles, could you please get her some water? "
"Niles: Of course, of course. "
"Diane: Oh, everything I told you tonight is a lie. I'm sorry for this. Oh, I must look just awful. "
"Martin: Your cheek stopped jumping. "
"Frasier: All right, now. Tell me what happened. Was it about your play? "
"Daphne: There it goes again "
"Frasier: Look, would you people please just give us some privacy? "
"Frasier: All right now. From the beginning. "
"Diane: Well, it all started a few months ago when I lost my job. I'd been writing for 'Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman.' I was on the set one day, and I was trying to show Jane Seymour the proper way to cauterize a wound with a branding iron, and I accidentally set her hair on fire. Well, from there it was a steady slide downhill. A two-year relationship ended, I lost the beach house, friends stopped calling — the one bright spot was my play in Seattle. Well, I flew up here yesterday only to find that the backer was pulling out. I was so distraught I found myself wandering around the city in complete despair. It's then that like a ray of hope from heaven, I saw your smiling face on the side of a bus. And that's why I'm here today. You helped me the only other time I was this low. Frasier, I'm asking for your help again. "
"Frasier: Of course I'll help you, Diane. "
"Diane: Oh, Frasier... "
"to: The kitchen. "
"Daphne: Well, that was a bit scary. "
"Martin: I'll say — watching someone go completely crackers like that. "
"Martin: What's the matter with you now? "
"Niles: Nothing, I'm fine. Just suddenly missing my Maris. "
"Frasier: My God, Niles, it's such a glorious day I walked all the way here. Thirty-two blocks, and Bruno Maglies be damned Oh yes, I see the look, I know exactly what it means too. How could I very well say 'no' to Diane? She came to me in crisis. Oh, excuse me, a double cappuccino, please, light cinnamon, thank you very much. Oh, you know, the change in Diane has really been quite gratifying. Dropped her off at the theater today, and there was a smile on her face that I haven't seen in... well, far too many years. Oh, I know what you're thinking. Where did she get the money to do the play? Well, she found a backer It's tax deductible [the waitress brings his coffee] Thank you. Oh, why don't you go ahead and say what you're thinking, Niles? That I'm falling for her again. 'Well, you did bounce in here as though you were on top of the world, and babbling about her smile' — I just don't want to hear it, Niles I'm simply helping her to get back on her feet and out of my life as quickly as possible. No, I don't know how long it's going to take. Look, I said I don't know Oh, really, Niles Curse you, you are the most infuriating busybody I'm not sitting with you. "
"TO: "
"Diane: It really is a lovely city. "
"Frasier: 'Night — making all things dimly beautiful...' "
"Diane: 'One veil over us both.' Cyrano? "
"Frasier: Yes. Eleven years later, we're still on the same page. "
"Diane: Frasier, these past few weeks, you've given so much of yourself to me. I want to give the one gift I have to bestow. I want you to be the first person to see my play. Will you come to dress rehearsal tonight? "
"Frasier: Diane, I'd be honored? "
"Diane: Oh, wonderful, wonderful "
"Diane: Give me a second. "
"Frasier: Are you sure you're ready for this? "
"Diane: Oh yes, it's time. Tonight, I bare myself to you. "
"Frasier: Big step, Diane. "
"Diane: Oh well, I have to say I'm a little nervous about it. But, barring any lighting or prop problems, the whole thing will be over in a couple of hours. "
"Martin: Hello People still in the house here "
"Diane: Meet me at the theater at seven... I don't know what I've done to deserve you. "
"Frasier: Hey, Dad. "
"Martin: Listen, it's none of my business, but you're not falling for her again, are you? "
"Frasier: What if I were? "
"Martin: That woman dumped you at the altar. "
"Frasier: Oh, that was the old Diane. She no longer sees herself as the center of the universe. And I'm not the old Frasier anymore either. People can change, Dad. "
"Martin: Yeah, I suppose you're right. Take me for instance. The old Martin would have said, 'you're out of your mind. I'd rather see you go gay and shack up with the punk who shot me than go off with her. I'd rather see you sewed up inside the body of a dead horse.' But the new Martin just says, 'Vivee a l'amour.' "
"Frasier: The new Frasier resists the temptation to correct your French. "
"TO: "
"Diane: Well, the stage is set, my players are prepared. So, without further ado, I give you 'Rhapsody and Requiem,' a play by Diane Chambers. "
"Stan: Boy, it sure is great having Mary Anne back. Just wasn't the same when she was gone. "
"Clark: Yeah, well, you know, uh, recent studies at John Hopkins University revealed that the expression 'absence makes the heart grow fonder,' is in actuality rooted in scientific bedrock. "
"Darla: Yeah, so's your head. "
"Stan: Ease up there, Darla. "
"Ned: Evenin', everybody. "
"Stan: Hey there, Ned. What would you say to a beer? "
"Ned: What's a nice beer like you doing in a face like this? "
"Franklin: Salutations, all. "
"Stan: Hey there, Doc. What can I get you? "
"Franklin: Ooh, a prickly choice, Stan. It reminds me of the one the 18th-century wit John Wilkes faced when asked by the Earl of Sandwich whether he expected to die on the gallows or of the pox. 'That depends, sir,' he said, 'on whether I choose to embrace your principles or your mistress.' "
"Anne: Evening, people. "
"All: Mary Anne "
"TO: Later. "
"Stan: I pour beer down people's throats. "
"Ned: I drink it. "
"Franklin: Our lives are empty. So what draws our feet here night after night? "
"Franklin: Mary Anne. "
"TO: Later. "
"Anne: Well, I'm off. See you anon, mi amore. "
"Stan: You bet, honey. "
"Diane: Hold it, stop What kind of a kiss was that? You two are supposed to be in love "
"Stan: Well, I didn't know how big you wanted it. "
"Diane: Remember that kiss you gave me this morning? "
"Stan: Like this one? "
"Diane: That's the one. OK, from the kiss "
"Stan: You bet, honey. "
"Anne: Forgive me, Franklin. I suppose that was a tad inconsiderate. "
"Franklin: Quite all right. A loving spirit like yours can't be bridled. "
"Anne: But I did leave you at the altar. "
"Franklin: No, you know I hold no ill-will toward you for that. "
"Franklin: Could we just stop for a second? This whole getting-left-at-the-altar thing, I just don't know what I'm supposed to be feeling. "
"Frasier: I may be able to illuminate that for you "
"Frasier: What you are feeling is that this woman has reached into your chest, plucked out your heart, and thrown it to her hell- hounds for a chew toy And it's not the last time either Because that's what this woman is She is the Devil There's no use running away from her, because no matter how far you go, no matter how many years you let pass, you will never be completely out of reach of those bony fingers So drink hearty, Franklin, and laugh Because you have made a pact with Beelzebub And her name is Mary Anne "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Diane? "
"Diane: Frasier... "
"Frasier: I thought we should talk. "
"Diane: Well, yes, I think we should. I tried to reach you at your home. "
"Frasier: I was driving around. "
"Diane: I'm sorry if I in any way misled you about my feelings these last few weeks. "
"Frasier: You didn't. I think I misled myself. "
"Diane: Well, at the very least I obviously owe you an apology for the first time that things went awry between us. "
"Frasier: Oh, it's all right. "
"Diane: No, it was a time in my life when— "
"Frasier: No, Diane, it isn't necessary. The things I said... well, they just needed saying. Besides, I don't really feel all that harshly — and in retrospect, I'm reasonably sure that you are not the Devil... although he does have the power to assume pleasing shapes. "
"Diane: Well, you should know I've decided to go back to Los Angeles. Watching the play tonight through fresh eyes, I — well, I just don't think it's ready. "
"Frasier: I'm sure things'll work out fine. Well, I think I've said what I came to say. "
"Diane: Frasier, um, before you go, there's one last thing you could help me with, not that you haven't helped me a lot already. It's the last scene, where Franklin and Mary Anne say goodbye. It's never felt quite right to me. I'd like her to stand... oh, right about here and tell him how much he's meant to her and how she'll never forget him. How do you suppose... 'Franklin' would respond to that? "
"Frasier: Well, I suppose he'd tell her that he feels the same way. That she's touched him in a way she can never imagine, he's glad she was in his life. "
"Diane: All that would be left would be the 'goodbye.' How do you see that? "
"Frasier: Well, I suppose he could say, uh, 'until we meet again,' probably certain that they never would. "
"Diane: But mightn't there be a part of him that hopes they would? "
"Frasier: Oh, I suppose so, yes. All right, then, don't have him sum things up. Just let them say their goodbyes, and if their paths happen to cross again, so be it... Goodbye, Mary Anne. "
"Diane: Goodbye, Franklin. "
"Diane: Oh yes, that's a perfect moment Uncluttered by any extra words or phrases— "
"Frasier: Diane. "
"Diane: Oh shoot, I've blown it "
"Frasier: All right, let's try it again. Goodbye, Diane. "
"Diane: Goodbye, Frasier. "
"Frasier: Force of habit. "
"Diane: I've been doing it all week. "

"Frasier: Morning Daphne, Dad. "
"Daphne: Shhh You'll ruin his concentration He's on a stakeout to catch whoever's been pinching our newspaper. He's been at it for over an hour I must say, I can see why he was such a good policeman. "
"Frasier: Yes, very impressive, isn't he? When he wakes up you must get him to tell you about his stint as security coordinator for Jimmy Hoffa "
"Frasier: Dad, come on, rise and shine. "
"Martin: Huh? "
"Frasier: You fell asleep. Oh, good morning, Niles "
"Niles: Hello. "
"Frasier: Ah yes, I see our newspaper thief has struck again "
"Martin: Damn, he's good "
"Frasier: Come on in. "
"Niles: This morning, for the first time since our separation, Maris actually picked up the phone and called me She needs a favour. "
"Frasier: Well Niles, I think that's hardly cause to celebrate. She called you just because she wants something? "
"Niles: No, no, not 'wants,' Frasier; 'needs.' This is my chance to show her how necessary I really am to her, and all I have to do is fix one small problem "
"Martin: What's the problem? "
"Niles: Uh, she's wanted by the police. Apparently, she was driving past a shoe store last week, when she spotted a stunning pair of Ferragamo pumps. Well, I need not remind you what effect a Ferragamo sighting can have on Maris's hand-eye coordination. She drove up on the sidewalk, and when the police ran her name through the computer they found quite a little backlog of unpaid parking tickets "
"Frasier: What else would you expect from a woman who thinks her chocolate allergy entitles her to park in a handicapped space? "
"Niles: Oh, and to top it all off she neglected to appear for her summons, and so they immediately swore out a warrant, and that brings us to you, Dad. "
"Martin: Why? "
"Niles: You were a cop. I'm sure you still have 'chums,' hint-hint? Who could lend you a hand, wink-wink? "
"Martin: No. Look, you know I'd do anything for you, but not this. All my years on the force I never even fixed a ticket, let alone an arrest warrant. "
"Niles: You couldn't pull one little string? "
"Martin: No, I hope everything works out for you, but I think the law should be the same for everyone. "
"Niles: Well, it's not. We'd all like to believe that justice is blind, but the sad truth is, wealthy white women just can't get a fair shake The courts love to make examples of them. "
"Daphne: Oh, they do. Just think of Zsa Zsa Gabor, or Leona Helmsley. "
"Frasier: Oh yes, two perfectly lovely women victimised by an unjust system. "
"Niles: Alright, fine. If you won't help me, I'll just have to help myself. I'm going down to that precinct house, and I'm not leaving until I get justice. Well, not exactly justice, I suppose, more like preferential treatment, but I'm not leaving 'til I get it "
"Daphne: What a horrible thing to happen. Can you picture poor Mrs. Crane confined to a jail cell? "
"Frasier: Only if they moved the bars closer together. "
"Frasier: Well, that's it for today, folks This is Dr. Frasier Crane wishing you good mental health He hits the off-air switch, and Niles enters, distressed. "
"Niles: Frasier, I feel as if I'm being sucked into a vortex of rage and despair "
"Frasier: Well, right back atcha I take it things didn't go down so well at the station? "
"Niles: The police simply would not listen to reason. "
"Roz: Police? "
"Niles: They're persecuting my Maris over some silly parking fines. I felt sure they'd ease up if they understood Maris a little better, so I tried to explain her to them. "
"Frasier: Oh, dear God. "
"Roz: You know, I dated a guy once who got in trouble with the cops... "
"Niles: Notice the complete absence of gasps following that statement. "
"Roz: Oh OK fine, you little weasel. Just forget it. I was going to help you, but Maris can just rot in the slammer. "
"Niles: Ooh Roz, I was joshing I know how you enjoy our little by-play That weasel line, ouch, touché "
"Roz: You know what, you're even more annoying when you grovel. "
"Niles: Zing Got me again "
"Frasier: Roz, if not for his sake, then for mine, please? "
"Roz: OK, for you. My friend Phil had some major traffic violations, and he was so freaked that he called this guy who, you know, fixes things. "
"Frasier: Sounds just a tad shady, Roz. You mean he went to some hoodlum? "
"Roz: Well, I wouldn't use the word 'hoodlum' in front of him. Just think of him as a guy who makes wishes come true. Like a fairy godfather. Another word I wouldn't use in front of him. Here we go Jerome Belasco. "
"Niles: Oh Roz, you are an angel of mercy. How can I repay you? "
"Roz: The next time you think of some witty little thing to say about my sex life, or what I'm wearing, just keep it to yourself. "
"Niles: [looking her up and down, searching for something nice to say] Consider it done. Roz snatches the card back, then Niles snatches it off her. "
"Niles: Give me that Roz exits. Frasier takes the card from Niles. "
"Frasier: No, give me that "
"Niles: Frasier "
"Frasier: Are you mad? I will not have you turning a minor, albeit annoying situation into a, a Martin Scorsese film "
"Niles: You don't understand what this means to me. When Maris asked me for this favour, do you know what she said? She said, 'Niles, will you be my Commodore?' "
"Frasier: Her Commodore? "
"Niles: That's what she used to call her father. Frasier, there was no problem so great that that man couldn't fix it. "
"Frasier: I'm sure. "
"Niles: Remember that lovely jeweled crucifix Maris picked up on her first communion trip to Rome? Who do you think smoothed things over with the Vatican? "
"Frasier: Yes, whatever happened to the days when a parent would take a wayward child by the hand, march them back to the scene of the crime and make them say, 'I'm sorry, Your Holiness, it'll never happen again'? "
"Niles: You don't understand. If I show Maris that I can step into the Commodore's plimsolls, she'll have a whole new respect for me. We can rebuild our marriage on a healthier foundation. Frasier, please. "
"Niles: Thank you. I just know this man is the answer to my problems. "
"Frasier: Yes, who better to mend the fragile fabric of a troubled marriage than a man whose business address is a wharf They both exit the booth, FADE OUT. "
"Frasier: Niles, look. This is ridiculous, it's past midnight. I'm leaving. "
"Niles: No, no, no, you can't leave. You're my backup. I wonder what's keeping him? "
"Frasier: Do you suppose that's him? "
"Niles: I doubt it, that overcoat is Armani "
"Frasier: Good point, Niles. Where would a criminal come up with the money for something like that? "
"Jerome: Oh, Dr. Crane, I presume? "
"Niles: Oh, yes. I'm Niles Crane, this is my brother, Dr. Frasier Crane. "
"Jerome: Jerome Belasco. "
"Frasier: Pleasure. "
"Jerome: Excuse my tardiness, but my lady friend and I were having one of those discussions from which it is difficult to remove oneself. "
"Frasier: Yes, we certainly know about those, don't we? "
"Niles: Yes, dames "
"Jerome: So you have some problem you think I can help you with? "
"Niles: Well, I do. Please, Jerome. "
"Niles: Well, you see, last week my lady got on the wrong side of 'Larry Law,' and since then certain, shall we say, 'complications' have arisen, and in brief, things have got 'hot-hot-hot,' and we believe you are the man to 'turn on the air conditionin'.' "
"Jerome: I sense you're a film buff, Dr. Crane. "
"Frasier: Just show him the charges, Niles. "
"Niles: Yes, here we are. Quite a few. "
"Jerome: 'Ignoring a summons, speeding, reckless endangerment.' Your wife sounds like a very carefree lady. "
"Frasier: Oh, yes. She's ounces of fun. "
"Niles: Do you think you could persuade the police to show some leniency? "
"Jerome: Well, there's never any harm in making a phone call. Excuse me. "
"Niles: Thank you Yes, around and straight to the back. "
"Niles: He's making the call He's making the call Frasier, you're going to think I'm mad for saying this, but... that was fun "
"Frasier: Well, I must admit, Niles, it is not entirely unpleasant to rub shoulders with the demi-monde. I definitely felt a real testosterone surge, you know? "
"Niles: Me too, me too It's like an actual tingling in my chest. And now it's gone... there it is again ...and now it's gone. "
"Frasier: Oh, Niles, it must be your cellular phone vibrating. "
"Niles: Oh, it is You're right. [he reaches into his inside pocket and takes out the phone] Hello? Oh hello, Maris Yes, I'm tending to that very matter right now. [he sees Jerome approaching] Oh, just wait a second. "
"Frasier: Well? "
"Jerome: You may consider the matter dealt with. "
"Niles: Maris, it's all taken care of... What did you say? No, I've just never heard those words before. You're welcome. [he hangs up the phone] Oh Jerome, thank you "
"Jerome: Now, if you'll excuse me gentlemen, I've got another business engagement. "
"Frasier: At this hour of the night? My God, it's past midnight. What kind of business could it possibly be [realises what he's saying] ...of mine where you're going [laughs nervously] "
"Niles: Tell me, what do I owe you? "
"Jerome: Oh, nothing. I was happy I could help. "
"Niles: Oh, don't be silly. I insist "
"Jerome: Consider it a favour. I was in a position to help you. Perhaps someday you'll be in a position to help me. [he stands to leave] "
"Niles: Oh, I would love that. If there's ever anything I can do for you, just say the word. "
"Jerome: You're very kind. It was a pleasure meeting you both. "
"Niles: And you. And I meant that Anything at all, you just let me know "
"Niles: I shouldn't have said that, should I? "
"Jerome: Dr. Crane. "
"Frasier: Jerome Look Niles, it's Jerome In my house "
"Daphne: We've been having the most delightful chat. "
"Jerome: Dr. Crane, you're a lucky young man to have such a charming young woman in your employ. "
"Daphne: Oh, go on. Did you know his brother supplied the cement for this very building? "
"Niles: What a small world, oh look at the time "
"Martin: So Jerome, you didn't tell us what line of work you're in. "
"Daphne: Oh wait, let me guess I'm a bit psychic. Let's see... you're some sort of doctor. An osteopath, perhaps? "
"Jerome: No. "
"Daphne: Well that's odd. I can see you hovering over people with broken bones. "
"Martin: Boys, why don't you help me get some refreshments for your new friend? "
"Frasier: Yes, yes Excuse us, Jerome "
"Martin: Who the hell is this guy? "
"Niles: He's some hooligan who helped fix Maris's legal problem, and in return I promised him a favour. Oh God, do you think that's why he's here? To collect? "
"Frasier: No, Niles. He's probably having a luau and he came to borrow our Poi Ramekins "
"Martin: Are you guys nuts? You don't get involved with somebody like that "
"Niles: Wait, before we panic, we should at least talk to him. You know, get the 'straight dope.' Also known as 'the skinny.' "
"Frasier: Knock it off, Bugsy "
"Jerome: Stealing newspapers is most un-neighbourly behaviour. If you would like I could find out who's doing it, and make sure they never even think... "
"Frasier: Oh no No That's fine "
"Niles: So Jerome, is there something we can do for you? "
"Jerome: Since you ask, you may recall the other evening I mentioned my lady friend? If I may... "
"Daphne: Oh She's a pretty thing, isn't she "
"Jerome: This is at the dog track where we met. And here's our first Sinatra Concert. And this was at the funeral of a business associate. "
"Frasier: You know, for the life of me, I can't recall ever having seen a woman wearing so many different kinds of furs all at the same time. "
"Jerome: Well, Brandy is a uniquely stylish woman. "
"Niles: Brandy? "
"Jerome: Yeah, the traditional spelling. "
"Jerome: We've been engaged for eight years, but she refuses to set a wedding date. This upsets me. It also upsets my mother, whose comments on the subject are frequent and vivid. "
"Martin: So where do these two come in? "
"Jerome: Well, if she's reluctant to marry me, obviously she needs therapy. "
"Frasier: Well, you're in luck Niles happens to be one of the finest marriage counselers in all of Seattle "
"Jerome: Well actually, Dr. Crane, I would prefer it if Brandy spoke to you. "
"Frasier: To me? "
"Jerome: No offense to you, Dr. Crane. "
"Niles: Oh, none taken "
"Jerome: She's a great fan of your show. I'm sure she'd heed any advice that you might care to offer. Such as 'Marry him. Promptly.' But I'm not here to put words into your mouth. You'll know what to say. "
"Frasier: Jerome, you know I'm a psychiatrist. I'm used to rendering my opinion, not being a mouthpiece for someone else. I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this. "
"Jerome: Dr. Crane, there are some times in life we must do unpleasant things. I'd hate to tell you some of the unpleasant things I've had to do. "
"Frasier: I see. Well then, why don't you just give Brandy my unlisted home number, which I'm sure you came across when you were finding out where I lived. I'll be glad to chat with her. "
"Jerome: Thank you. She'll be in touch. And I hope that one day you'll dance at my wedding. He leaves. "
"Frasier: If I'm able to dance. "
"Martin: If you ask me, you're getting off easy. He could have asked you for a much bigger favour. "
"Frasier: Dad, how can I possibly as a self-respecting psychiatrist tell any woman to marry that thug? "
"Daphne: What are you talking about? He seemed very nice to me. "
"Frasier: This coming from the psychic who thought he was a chiropractor "
"Martin: Listen, I've heard your show. One more piece of half-assed advice isn't going to kill you. Frasier gives him a look. "
"Martin: Jerome, on the other hand... "
"Frasier: Okay, dad "
"Frasier: The key to lasting weight-loss is to change the way you view food everyday. You can't go on through life binging and then starving yourself for two weeks just to fit into that gorgeous new evening gown you've bought for a special occasion. Can you understand that? "
"Steve: Yeah. Thanks Doc. "
"Frasier: Don't mention it, Steve. Roz, who's our next caller? "
"Roz: We have Randy, from Richmond Beach. "
"Frasier: Hello Randy, I'm listening. "
"Brandy: Not Randy, Brandy. "
"Frasier: Brandy? "
"Brandy: The traditional spelling. "
"Frasier: You know we're all out of time, my goodness I feel so sorry but... "
"Roz: No, you're not. We've got five minutes left "
"Frasier: Thank you, Roz Alright Brandy, go ahead. Your problem, please. "
"Brandy: It's my boyfriend, Jerome. He said I should call you. We've been semi-engaged for eight years, and he wants to get married. "
"Frasier: Well, I can certainly hear the love in your voice, so I say case closed, best of luck to you in the future "
"Brandy: Whoa You got a bus to catch? There's a lot more to it. For starters I think he's cheated on me. "
"Roz: Well, in my experience, if you suspect something like that, nine out of ten times you're right. "
"Frasier: Well, I think a little mistrust adds mystery to a relationship. ' "
"Brandy: Mystery I could stand if he didn't neglect me so much. Every time we go for a romantic dinner he gets a phone call and bang, it's 'Gotta work babe, finish your lobster. I'll send you a limo.' "
"Frasier: Lobster? Limos? My God, give me his number and I'll marry him "
"Brandy: Money ain't everything, especially when you've got a sex life like ours... "
"Roz: He's not even good in bed? "
"Brandy: Who knows? We're never there long enough to find out "
"Frasier: You know, this really isn’t necessary... "
"Brandy: I said to him last night, 'What the hell was that? I've been vaccinated slower' "
"Frasier: Well, that just leaves more time to cuddle "
"Roz: Can I say something? "
"Frasier: No "
"Brandy: Look, I could deal with the other problems, if it weren't for one thing. All my life I've dreamed of being a career woman, but he says I'm not allowed to work I'm supposed to sit home all day, let him take care of me. So, what do you think Doc? Should I marry him? "
"Frasier: Well... taking into account the years you've invested in the relationship, and Jerome's obvious love for you, not to mention his generosity... "
"Brandy: Tell me what you think Dr. Crane 'cause I really, really respect you. "
"Frasier: Brandy... run Save yourself. Do not marry this man. [he presses the button to cut her off] This is Dr Frasier Crane, saying goodbye, and see you, God willing, tomorrow. "
"Frasier: Yes, I'll have a non-fat, decaf latte, please. Oh, what the hell? Look, make it a full-fat mocha with extra whipped cream. What the hell, put a slice of bacon on it "
"Niles: Hello, Frasier. "
"Frasier: Niles Don't do that "
"Niles: Sorry. I heard you on the radio today. I thought what you did Was noble. To what South American nation will you be fleeing? "
"Frasier: Oh, like I'd tell you. One minute of interrogation and you would crack like a Jordan almond "
"Niles: Frasier, I never meant for any of this to happen. How long are you going to stay mad at me? "
"Frasier: For as long as I live. Which'll probably take us through breakfast. "
"Frasier: Oh, wrong again "
"Niles: Oh, oh look It's Jerome Belasco Jerome, take a seat Look Frasier, it's our friend, [turns to lady sitting behind them] Jerome Belasco. "
"Jerome: I heard your broadcast this afternoon. It displeased me. Yeah, let me have a little hot milk, please. When I'm displeased I get acid in my stomach, Dr. Crane. "
"Frasier: Believe me, the last thing I wanted to do is displease you. Or to hear the words 'acid' and 'Dr. Crane' in the same sentence. But - Jerome, I'm sorry - how could I have advised her otherwise? She said that you cheated on her. "
"Jerome: She said she suspected me I've never cheated on Miss Brandy. "
"Frasier: Alright, be that as it may, how can I advise her to marry a man who's so controlling that he won't even allow her to work? "
"Jerome: It may interest you to know that over the years I've called in favours to get Miss Brandy fourteen jobs She lost all of them. "
"Frasier: So you're saying she's had trouble finding her niche? "
"Jerome: No, I'm saying she's a dodo. Now you may love a dodo; you may think the dodo is beautiful; you may even wish to marry the dodo. But you do not encourage a dodo to fly Now, when she loses these jobs it makes her very unhappy. So for her sake I said 'No more jobs.' But now, in order to convince her to marry me, I've had to reverse this policy. "
"Frasier: So she has agreed to marry you? "
"Jerome: If I get her a job. And not just any job. A job that she can never lose. A job where if she burns the place down, they will apologise to her for having made it so flammable. "
"Niles: Well, good luck finding someone who'll hire her. "
"Daphne: Dr. Crane, your brother called. The court time for your tennis game is 11 o'clock. "
"Frasier: Oh, good Lord. I distinctly told him I wasn't available until noon. "
"Martin: Hey, if you're going to call him back, put it on the speakerphone. "
"Frasier: Don't you think this is getting a little old? "
"Daphne: Well I think it's just mean, is what I think. "
"Martin: So sue me, I enjoy it. "
"Brandy: Good morning Niles Crane, psy-kee-at-trist. "
"Frasier: Yes, is Dr. Crane there? This is his brother, Frasier. "
"Brandy: Oh hi, Dr. Crane. It's me, Brandy. Hang on, I'm getting another call. "

"Skyline: A helicopter rises above the skyline. "
"Martin: Hey, Daphne You seen Eddie? "
"Daphne: No, I haven’t. "
"Martin: It just doesn’t feel right to start the day without him licking me awake. "
"Daphne: Well, don’t look at me. "
"Frasier: Morning, all. Daphne, I got treats "
"Martin: What the hell are you doing with him? "
"Frasier: We went for a walk. "
"Martin: I’m talking to Eddie. "
"Frasier: When I saw what a beautiful day it was, I headed for the park. Of course, the only people in the park at this hour of the morning without dogs are winos and that guy in the harem pants that washes his hair in the fountain. He says hello, by the way. "
"Daphne: It is sort of nice out, isn’t it? "
"Frasier: Sort of nice? My God, haven’t you people noticed this? It’s incredible Dad, you should feel this. It’s eighty degrees outside and it’s the middle of February "
"Daphne: Oh, it is beautiful, and in the middle of such a terrible winter. Oh, I love nature’s little "
"aberrations: warm days in winter, four leaf clovers, Australians... "
"Frasier: Yes, it is glorious. It defies you not to take a moment to acknowledge the power that created it. "
"Martin: Thank you, global warming Hey Frasier, think your guy down at the liquor store could send a bottle of Scotch to my buddy Jimmy in Montana? "
"Frasier: Sure, Dad. What’s the occasion? "
"Martin: Today’s his sixteenth birthday. "
"Frasier: Oh well, you’ll want to throw in a hooker too, won’t you? "
"Martin: No, don’t you get it? It’s February 29th. "
"Frasier: Hmm. "
"Martin: It’s a leap year. "
"Frasier: Right. "
"Martin: He only gets a birthday every four years. "
"Frasier: I get it, Dad. "
"Martin: He’s really sixty-four. "
"Frasier: I can do the math. "
"Martin: Jimmy’s having a big shindig tonight. A lot of guys from the force fly in for it. Everybody drinks a lot of beer, and then they have a contest to see who’s got the biggest scar. You know, this year I had a real good chance of winning it now that “Shark Bait” O’Reilly’s finally died. "
"Daphne: So, why aren’t you going? "
"Frasier: Yeah Dad, you should go. "
"Martin: Ah, Montana’s too far away. "
"Frasier: Well Dad, his birthday only comes around once every four years. As a matter of fact, this day only comes around every four years. You know, it’s like a free day, a gift. We should do something special, be bold It’s leap year, take a leap "
"Martin: You know, I was just about to say the same thing to you. "
"Daphne: Your son’s right. You shouldn’t be afraid to shake up your routine a little bit. "
"Martin: Hey, I don’t see you taking any big leaps today. "
"Daphne: If there was something I wanted to do, I would do it. "
"Martin: Well, you’re always whining about wanting to change your hair. "
"Daphne: I don’t whine "
"Martin: “I’m so sick of me hair. Do you think I should get it cut like Princess Di? Ooh, do you think that’d make me cheeks look too fat? That reminds me of the craziest thing me Grammy Moon used to say” "
"Martin: I’ll pay for the damn haircut if you stop yakking and just do it. "
"Daphne: Yes, well I’ll pay for you to go to Montana. [aside to Frasier] That’s not the one next to New Hampshire, is it? "
"Frasier: No. And Dad can pay for his own trip. "
"Daphne: All right, then. And I can pay for me own haircut. "
"Frasier: All right, Dad, back in your court. Are you up to the leap year challenge? "
"Martin: Ah... "
"Frasier: Dad, Jimmy’s already sixteen. How many more birthdays is he going to have? "
"Martin: You know, I would kind of hate not being there when Jimmy brings out the big ham. Oh, all right, what the hell, I’ll go. I’ll call the airlines after breakfast. "
"Frasier: That’s the spirit "
"Martin: Hey, what’s your big leap year challenge? "
"Frasier: Well, have you forgotten? I’m singing “Buttons and Bows” tonight at the P.B.S. pledge drive. "
"Martin: You sung that same stupid song for the last three years. "
"Frasier: Yes, but I’m doing something remarkably fresh and different with it this year "
"Martin: You’re just blowing smoke, aren’t you? "
"Frasier: Like a ’56 Rambler "
"Frasier: Good morning, Niles "
"Niles: Good? It’s glorious, heaven-sent And you know why? Maris called She wants to get together with me this evening. "
"Frasier: Oh Niles, that’s wonderful news It’s high time you and Maris sat down and talked through your problems. "
"Niles: She doesn’t want to talk. When she says “get together” she means in the “You wear the crème fraiche, I’ll lick it off” sense. She’s cleared her schedule from seven till seven- thirty, that means foreplay AND cuddling "
"Martin: You know, Niles, remember when you were a kid and your mother and I wouldn’t discuss the Cuban Missile Crisis in front of you because we knew it’d give you bad dreams? "
"Niles: Yes. "
"Martin: It’s a two-way street. "
"Daphne: Breakfast, Dr. Crane? "
"Niles: Uh yes, thank you, Daphne. "
"Frasier: Niles, I don’t mind telling you, I’m a little bit concerned about this. Maris claps her hands, you come running? "
"Niles: Oh well, don’t forget there’s a little something for me in this too. I haven’t had sex in six months. "
"Frasier: Oh, surely you’re exaggerating, you’ve only been separated for three. "
"Niles: And your point would be? "
"Frasier: You really want to sacrifice your self-respect for a roll in the hay? "
"Niles: Substitute a 16th-century giltwood fainting couch for hay and watch me roll "
"Frasier: Niles, you and Maris have not sat down and discussed your problems. As a psychiatrist you know that sex will only cloud the issues. "
"Niles: You don’t realize how desperate I am. Ever since our separation, I’ve been paying women to touch me. "
"Frasier: Oh, Niles... "
"Niles: Manicurists, pedicurists, facialists. Whenever you see a man who’s well-groomed, you can bet he’s not getting any. "
"Frasier: Well, will you at least think about what I’ve said? "
"Niles: I can’t. She’s leaving for Europe in the morning, so I have a very small window of opportunity. "
"Frasier: Niles... you know I’m right. "
"Niles: You just don’t want me to have sex because you’re not having any "
"Frasier: I most certainly am too "
"Niles: Your lips say yes, but your cuticles speak volumes. "
"Frasier: Niles... "
"Niles: Oh, you’re right. I’ll tell her no. It’s not going to be easy, though. "
"Frasier: Of course not. Just don’t think about sex. "
"Daphne: Would you like me to butter your buns for you, Dr. Crane? "
"Frasier: Grandma in a teddy. "
"Niles: Thank you. "
"Frasier: You’re all mine in buttons and bows [pushes the door closed with his foot] "
"Roz: Oh God, it must be P.B.S. pledge time again. "
"Frasier: Mmm-hmm Roz, it is a wonderful day. You know, I think the entire city of Seattle is convinced it’s springtime. I was walking down the street, I passed a pet store, and in the window I could see two snakes doing a mating dance. "
"Roz: If you ask me, celebrating a dance that brings more snakes into the world is like toasting a law school graduation. "
"Frasier: Well, I can see the unseasonable sunshine has done nothing to improve your mood. "
"Roz: Well, how would you feel if you just lost the love of your life? "
"Frasier: Well, alimony aside, I found it rather liberating. "
"Roz: My car wouldn’t start, so I had to take the bus. And we’re all crowded on there, when suddenly I smell Lagerfeld, and I – I look up, and there he is. "
"Frasier: Carl Lagerfeld? "
"Roz: His name is Gary. I don’t know his last name. Anyway, we got to talking, and you know, we were really connecting. I started to believe in kismet. And all of a sudden, all these people want to get off the bus, and I’m in their way, so I get off to let them out, and before I can get back on, the damn bus drives off – out of my life, forever. "
"Frasier: I’m sure another one would have come along in ten minutes or so. "
"Roz: I’m talking about the guy. "
"Frasier: So am I. "
"Roz: You don’t get it, Frasier. I mean, I really felt this guy was the one. "
"Frasier: Roz, if you really want to try to find him again, you know we do reach half a million listeners. Why don’t you just tell your story on the air? "
"Roz: On the air? Oh, I couldn’t do that, it would make me look pathetic. Oh, it’s too bizarre, it’s too needy. "
"Frasier: It’s two o’clock. "
"Roz: Oh my God "
"Frasier: A glorious good afternoon, Seattle. This is Dr. Frasier Crane. I’m thinking a lot today about leap year. Today is February 29th, and although it isn’t an official holiday, perhaps it could be looked upon as one in a metaphorical sense. Just as Christmas reminds us to be generous of spirit, so leap year reminds us to take a leap in our own lives. To be bold, try something new. Too often we shrink from doing things we really want to, held back by... oh, appearing foolish, perhaps... Roz? "
"Frasier: Is there anything you’d like to say before we start taking calls? "
"Roz: No. "
"Frasier: I’m reminded of a quotation by John Greenleaf "
"Whittier: “For all sad words of tongue or pen, the saddest are "
"these: ‘It might have been’”... Roz? "
"Roz: No. "
"Frasier: Did you know that a woman over the age of thirty has less chance of getting married than of being killed in a terrorist attack? "
"Roz: This is to Gary. I was on the Number Seven bus around noon, and you were a stockbroker with a tan briefcase and a cleft chin, and the bus was really crowded and we both reached for the hand strap and our hands touched and we laughed and you said I had a really great laugh and I said you had a really great laugh and we laughed at that... "
"Roz: Anyway, uh, you asked me if I were free on Friday, but we got separated before I could give you my phone number, which I would have because I really liked you and I thought you were cute. "
"Frasier: So Gary, if you’re listening, please, please give us a call. We’ll be right back after these words. "
"Frasier: Oh my God, oh my God How could I say “I really liked you and I thought you were cute” – who am I, Marcia Brady? "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Well, we’ll be right back for more calls, and more on the search for Gary, after this news break. "
"Niles: Good news I’ve figured out a way I can have sex and we can all be happy "
"Frasier: As I pause to make sure the “ON AIR” light is off, [Niles looks at the light, mortified] continue. "
"to: Hallway "
"Niles: Well, I was driving down the freeway [glances at a passing woman] trying hard not to notice the provocative decals truckers have on their mud flaps, when I heard your little speech about breaking out of familiar patterns. "
"Frasier: Mmm-hmm. "
"Niles: Well, sleeping alone has been my pattern I’m ready to take a leap "
"Frasier: No, you’re not. "
"Niles: Okay, not a leap, but you’ve got to give me something. A hop, a bound. Gimme a jump, oh God- "
"Frasier: Niles, will you just get a grip "
"to: Booth "
"Frasier: If you thought being with Maris was the right thing to do, you’d be there with her. You know it’s wrong. That’s why you’re here, asking for my permission. "
"Niles: Frasier, Frasier, what if we don’t have sex? What if we just snuggle? "
"Roz: Whoops, excuse me "
"Niles: Roz... I never noticed what a perky little walk you have. "
"Frasier: Niles, get back You just stop that Get control. My God, man, there are far more important things here than simple immediate physical gratification. "
"Niles: You’re right, I... I just have to martial my self-discipline and... and be strong. "
"Roz: Fifteen seconds. "
"Frasier: Oh. "
"Roz: What is wrong with your brother today? "
"Frasier: Oh, ignore him. You know, human nature never ceases to amaze me – how otherwise rational people can be turned into babbling ninnies by their hormones. "
"Roz: OH MY GOD IT’S GARY OH MY GOD IT’S HIM, IT’S HIM "
"Frasier: Well, we’re back. You’ll all be glad to know that Cupid’s arrow has hit its mark. Gary has just arrived in the hallway, and has a big bouquet of flowers for Roz. "
"Frasier: You know, the truth is, I’m really quite delighted with the way things have turned out today. It inspires me to take a little leap of my own. As many of you know, this evening, for the third year in a row I will be appearing on the P.B.S. pledge drive... "
"TO: Hallway "
"Gary: You know, I was getting a little nervous, the way you were describing me on the air. "
"Roz: Why? "
"Gary: Well, my wife listens to the show. "
"Roz: You’re married? "
"Gary: Yeah, but it’s okay. I still want to go out with you. "
"TO: Booth "
"Frasier: So, instead of “Buttons and Bows,” I have chosen to sing a very challenging aria from Verdi’s Rigoletto - something I have never attempted outside the shower. I certainly hope my little gamble turns out as well as Roz’s has. "
"Frasier: Or even better. "
"Frasier: Oh, God "
"Niles: Well, perhaps they’ll pledge to get you to stop singing. Oh, and by the way, thanks so much for the cold shower tip. "
"Frasier: Did it work? "
"Niles: No, it did not. It’s clearly an old wives’ tail, because I’m still thinking of my old wife’s tail. "
"Frasier: Yes, well I suppose it stood to reason being showered with coldness would only bring Maris more to mind. "
"Niles: Keep making remarks like that, I won’t help you rehearse. "
"Frasier: Oh, I’m sorry, Niles. It’s just that I’m awfully nervous. "
"Niles: You know, as much as I admire your willingness to take a leap, I did warn you that you were getting into a dangerous “aria.” Oh God, I’m using humor to mask sexual frustration. It’s high school all over again. "
"Frasier: Look Niles, I know it’s difficult, but Maris has got to learn that you’re not just someone who can be ordered to perform at will. Now sit, play "
"Martin: Next time it looks like I’m going to follow a piece of your advice, shoot me in the head first "
"Frasier: Dad Why aren’t you in Montana? "
"Martin: Fifteen minutes out, a flock of Canadian geese flew into one of our engines. They were the lucky ones "
"Martin: Next thing you know, we’re falling five thousand feet. Smokehouse almonds are flying everywhere, people are screaming and hugging each other. The guy in the next seat grabbed hold of my hand, and you know what? I didn’t pull it away "
"Martin: Then our pilot comes out. Our landing gear’s out, we’re gonna have to do an emergency belly landing in six feet of foam So, five hellish minutes later, we’re bouncing across the runway. Then the stewardess comes out and says we’re gonna have to go down the emergency slide. So down I go, headfirst into this sea of foam. Last thing I remember, this fat lady from across the aisle comes barreling down the chute after me like a polyester avalanche "
"Frasier: My God, Dad, I am so sorry. "
"Niles: So-so, these stewardesses, were they also covered with foam? "
"Frasier: Will you stop it Dad, if you’d like to talk about it, we’re both here for you. "
"Martin: Boy, I tell you, times like this, you just... all you can think of is your loved ones, and how you wish you’d spent more time with them. "
"All: Eddie "
"Niles: Well, let’s get back to work. "
"Frasier: Mmm-hmm. "
"Niles: I need something to take my mind off the fact that at this very moment, Maris is slipping out of her frilly under-things and into a non-fat milk bath. "
"Niles: Is something wrong? "
"Frasier: Yes, something’s wrong. Things turned out so badly for Roz and Dad today, I’m just wondering if my little leap is ill- advised. "
"Niles: Oh, now... "
"Frasier: Maybe this aria thing won’t turn out so well, either. "
"Niles: Just because theirs went wrong doesn’t mean yours will, too. "
"Frasier: Yeah... "
"Niles: They’re two isolated incidents. "
"Niles: All right. "
"Niles: Oh, will these infernal temptations never end? "
"Daphne: Oh, tell me the truth. Is it as bad as I think it is? "
"Frasier: How... bad do you think it is? "
"Daphne: Take a leap Mr. Maurice hair-designer Trust me Children pointing Your fault "
"Niles: Okay, that’s it. I can’t take it anymore, I’m leaving. "
"Frasier: No, Niles You can’t leave me now, I need you more now than ever. "
"Niles: Oh, give it up. No one who’s followed your little “take a leap” philosophy has ended up even remotely better. I don’t care what you’re saying, I’m going to Maris. "
"Frasier: You will rue the day "
"Niles: I don’t care Niles gotta have it "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Oh, Pete. "
"Pete: Hi, Doc. I hear you’re doing something new this year. [sees music] Whoa "
"Frasier: What, is it too hard for you? "
"Pete: Me? No, I’m-I’m worried about you. I can hit any note. [hits high note] See? "
"room: "
"Roz: No, Lamb Chop’s not here. Big Bird isn’t here either. What are you doing up so late? Oh. Do you have your mommy’s credit card handy? Have your mommy call us back later, bye-bye. "
"Roz: Well, I guess your little aria must be coming up soon. "
"Frasier: Yeah - along with some Veal Milanese and a rather disappointing Chardonnay. Oh, Roz, I hope you’re not still angry with me for the way my advice backfired today? "
"Roz: Oh no, not at all In fact, I’ve been meaning to tell you how much I admire you for what you’re doing tonight. After watching me crash and burn like that, you’re going to go out and sing this very difficult song... in a foreign language... under these unflattering lights, with your clothes soaked with sweat, on live television... "
"Frasier: How long are you going to stay mad at me? "
"Roz: Until the day I get married. "
"Pete: Yo, Doc, Doc Please, please, I’ve been going over your music, and when we get to this section here, either I can play really loud, or jab you with a pin, because between you and me, you’re not hitting this note without a pole vault. "
"Manager: Ten seconds, Dr. Crane. "
"Frasier: That’s it That’s it I’m not doing the aria "
"Roz: What? You’re backing out after you made all of us take those stupid leaps? "
"Frasier: You bet I am It may be an unwise man who doesn’t learn from his own mistakes, but it’s an absolute idiot that doesn’t learn from other people’s "
"Roz: But you promised all your listeners "
"Frasier: Oh, what’s the difference? [a red light on the camera blinks on] Who watches P.B.S.? "
"Frasier: I’ll tell you "
"who: discerning, cultured viewers, like yourselves. Hello, I’m Dr. Frasier Crane. And like yourselves, I care about quality programming, such as foreign films, classical music, opera – which is why I intended to sing a rather challenging "
"piece: an aria from Verdi’s Rigoletto. But, who am I to ignore the dozens of phone calls that have come in requesting my signature piece, a rather charming little ditty that I first sang three years ago on Classic Western Movie Week. So without further ado, I give you “Buttons and Bows,” from Paleface. Maestro, please? "
"below: "
"Frasier: And things and buttons, buttons and bows Da da dahs, and boppa dohs, Something, la-la-la You look great in buttons and bows la da-da da-da daaaa Everybody and la-la la-la mole that grows Bada souse, a pom capoose You’ll look buppity, buttons and bows "
"TO: "
"Daphne: Oh, I bet this is one leap year Dr. Crane won’t be sorry to see the back of "
"Daphne: Should we rewind it, so we can watch it again? "
"Martin: No, no, not yet, let it finish first, this is the verse where he REALLY loses it "
"Both: Bippity-boppity, hippity-dos Something and something, and buttons and bows "
"Martin: Okay, now you can rewind it "
"Martin: Hey "

"Roz: Well, it's uh... 2"
":07, here on the Dr. Frasier Crane Show. As I said, I'm Roz Doyle, Frasier's producer, [looks to see if Frasier is coming] filling in for the temporarily detained Dr. Crane. It's cloudy and 62 degrees outside coming up on 2"
":08... right... there. Well, let's take a call. Hello, Lydia. What seems to be the problem? "
"Lydia: I already told you. "
"Roz: Yeah, that was when I was the call screener, now I'm the host. So, tell me your problem, and take your time. "
"Lydia: Well, it started about two weeks ago. I got this terrible obscene phone call. It's happened several times since then and now it's to the point where I'm afraid to answer my own phone. "
"Roz: Well, obscene phone calls can be very disturbing. [Frasier bursts in] But luckily, Dr. Frasier Crane has just arrived and I'm sure he knows exactly what soothing things to say. "
"Roz: Maybe now would be a good time to take a break. We'll be right back after this. "
"Frasier: What the hell was that all about? "
"Roz: Oh, never mind that, where were you? "
"Frasier: Oh, god. Somebody'd parked in my space again. I had to park six blocks from here and sprint the whole way. By the end, my tweed pants were throwing off so many sparks I almost caught myself on fire I tell you what - the minute we go to a news break I'm going to rush down there and put this withering note on his windshield. “Dear discourteous driver...” "
"Roz: Whoa I think you've said enough right there [snatches his note] Come on, Frasier. This isn't gonna do any good You want to make an impression on him? Get tough. You go right down there and let the air out of his tires. "
"Frasier: Oh, I wouldn't do something like that. "
"Roz: Why? It's just inconveniencing him like he inconvenienced you. "
"Frasier: Roz, listen, the world has become uncivilized enough without me stooping to that level. Of course I was sorely tempted last night. I went to the movies to see 'How Green Was My Valley.' Lady Luck seated me in front of two elderly women who said with the arrival of each new actor, 'My God, doesn't he look young; he's dead, you know.' Finally I had to just walk out. "
"Roz: Oh, you're on in five seconds. And Brenda is on line one. "
"Frasier: Hello, Seattle. We're back, and I would like to start by apologizing for being tardy. Nothing quite so inconsiderate as making someone wait. Now without further ado let's get to Brenda. Hello, Brenda. "
"Brenda: Hi, Dr. Crane. I'm having a problem with my sister. She's always... Oh, wait a second. That's my other line. "
"Frasier: Something tells me I'm going to be siding with Brenda's sister. "
"Frasier: You're welcome Excuse me, I was wondering if you could direct me to... "
"Clerk: Friendly Video. Yeah, I think we got that one. Hang on a second, I'll check. "
"Frasier: Don't you hate that? You come all the way down here yourself to the store, wait patiently, and somebody who calls in from home gets preferential treatment. "
"Clerk: I can help the next person in line. "
"Clerk: Hey, do we have 'The Invisible Man?' "
"Frasier: Right here "
"Clerk: Thanks. "
"Frasier: Excuse me. I was looking for... [the phone rings again; the clerk reaches for the phone, but Frasier places his hand on top of it] Don't even think about it I'm looking for 'How Green Was My Valley.' "
"Clerk: Huh? "
"Frasier: It is a beautifully acted depiction of life in a small town in Wales. It won five Academy Awards It's a classic "
"Clerk: Oh. Well, uh, this is a shot in the dark, but you might try looking in the Classics section. "
"Frasier: Uh... you're taking 'How Green Was My Valley?' "
"Woman: I heard it was great. "
"Frasier: Yes, but you heard it from me You were standing next to me in the line [she says nothing and takes her place in line; Frasier, frustrated, goes back to the clerk] Excuse me, is there another copy? "
"Clerk: Oh yeah, that would be across the street in our 'How Green Was My Valley' annex. "
"TO: "
"Martin: Hey Daphne. Come on, you're just in time. It's starting. "
"Daphne: I don't get this show. People send in videos of themselves having the most embarrassing and painful accidents. They add cartoon noises and music and everyone laughs themselves silly. "
"Martin: Boy, I bet that hurt "
"Martin: Well, what's wrong with you? "
"Frasier: Frankly, I have had it with the whole boorish, ill-mannered world. Look, Dad, would you mind terribly if I used the TV tonight? I went to three video stores to get this tape. I'm just dying to see it. "
"Martin: Sure, go ahead. How many times can you watch a dog get hit with a swinging door? "
"Frasier: Depends upon the dog. "
"Frasier: What the hell is that? The windows are rattling, the walls are shaking, and I am talking to no one "
"Daphne: Well, I see our neighbor's at it again. "
"Frasier: Not for long "
"Martin: I'm gonna take a nap. "
"Frasier: Dad, you can't possibly expect to sleep in this racket. "
"Martin: Are you kidding? I've slept through worse than this. In Korea I dropped off in a foxhole right outside P'Anmunjom. By the time I woke up the cease-fire was over and I was the only one who didn't know about it. Talk about having egg on your face. "
"Frasier: Yes. Yes, would you please connect me with the young man who's just moved into the penthouse upstairs. No, I don't know his name He's in the penthouse He has shaggy hair, tattoos all over him, his body is pierced. Oh, and I don't know if I mentioned this but he's in the penthouse "
"Frasier: Has the world completely lost the concept of common courtesy? Am I the only one who is resisting this tide? [walks out onto the balcony and "
"bellows:] People of Seattle, listen to me We are not barbarians We are not Neanderthals and we are not French Do you hear that, you up there? [walks back in and gets a glass of sherry] "
"Daphne: That's his own music he's listening to, you know. His name is Freddie Chainsaw. "
"Frasier: Chainsaw? Of the Newport Chainsaws? How does an arrested adolescent who barely knows two chords get a penthouse? "
"Daphne: His last album sold five million copies. "
"Frasier: Oh. Well, then, I'll just add that to my list of reasons to die. "
"Daphne: You know, personally, I like it. But then, we Brits have always been on the cutting edge. You should have heard the punk rockers who rented the flat below me a few years back. They'd play the same song over and over "
"again: Flesh is burning... nana nana nana. Flesh is burning... nana nana nana. Oh no. I'm gonna have that tune in me head all day now. "
"Frasier: Yes, well, thank you for that, Daphne. But I've been waiting all day to watch my movie. "
"Frasier: Doesn't he ever stop for sex and drugs? [he grabs for the phone again and dials the operator] Hello. Yes. Please, I insist on being connected with the young man in the penthouse. [the music stops as Mr. Chainsaw answers his phone] Yes, hello, Mr. Chainsaw? Yes, how do you do? I'm Dr. Frasier Crane. I am your neighbor; I live right below you. Yes, do you have any idea how loud your music is? Oh. You do? Well... thank you. [he hangs up the phone, pleasantly surprised] Well, that wasn't so bad. The young man seemed quite amiable in his way. "
"Frasier: I'm going out "
"Daphne: What? "
"Frasier: I'm going out "
"Daphne: What? "
"Frasier: I AM GOING OUT "
"Martin: Hey, Frasier, will you keep it down out there. I'm trying to take a nap "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Smell me, Niles. "
"Niles: Grandpa "
"Frasier: Exactly On my way down in the elevator today a woman thinks nothing of lighting up a cigarette. Has the world gone mad? "
"Niles: I know exactly how you feel. This morning I discovered a ding in the door of my car. "
"Frasier: Let me guess - no note on the windshield? "
"Niles: No. And even worse, after I'd left the car off at the body shop, the rental agency didn't have a single luxury car left. They stuck me with some vehicle I believe they call a Hunchback. "
"Frasier: No. I think that would be a Hatchback, Niles. "
"Niles: It's painted panic-button red, with a large rear window that pops open. "
"Frasier: Oh, that would be the Hatchback. "
"Niles: Well, there's a novel "
"idea: name the car after its most hideous feature. I presume it was a toss-up between 'Hatchback' and 'What's that odor coming from the floor?' "
"Frasier: Oh, look, Niles - free table Go, go, go, go "
"Niles: Oh, the biscotti "
"Frasier: Leave it "
"Niles: Oh, no - go on without me "
"Frasier: Oh, there "
"Niles: Oh "
"Niles: Oh, check on table one "
"Frasier: All right, fine. "
"Frasier: Oh, we're not hovering, believe me. It's just that there... well, there's really no place else to stand. Oh, just take your time, please. There's no rush. "
"Waiter: Is the owner of a red Hatchback here? It's about to be towed. "
"Frasier: Niles, isn't that your car? "
"Niles: Shh Someone will hear you "
"Frasier: Niles, it's about to be towed "
"Niles: I'm not owning up to that car. I don't care if it's careening toward a baby carriage "
"Frasier: Oh. Oh, thank you so much. Take care, have a lovely day. "
"Frasier: Excuse me, but we were waiting for this table. "
"Man: So get another one. "
"Frasier: Well, there aren't any. Look, you knew that we were waiting for it. We politely stood back and let those people leave and then you just jumped right in here "
"Man: Well, you won't make that mistake again. "
"Niles: Frasier, Frasier... forget it. We'll just... we'll wait for another table. "
"Frasier: No, we won't This isn't about the table anymore This is about the erosion of common decency. [places his coffee on the table] Sir, when you treat me this way you encourage me to be discourteous to another. And so on and so on. [the man doesn't acknowledge him] You don't have any manners, do you? Then perhaps what you need is an etiquette lesson "
"Frasier: SIT DOWN, NILES "
"Niles: My brother will have a decaf. "
"Daphne: Flesh is burning, nana nana nana... "
"Martin: Nana nana nana... flesh is burning... nana nana nana... [sees Frasier enter] Oh, hi, Fras. How you feeling? "
"Frasier: Fine. "
"Martin: I didn't ask you yesterday how your day went. "
"Frasier: What did Niles tell you? "
"Martin: Nothing Geez, can't I ask you how your day went? How was work? "
"Frasier: Dammit Niles blabbed "
"Martin: No, he didn't. You made the people of Seattle column. Right here, under 'The Crane Mutiny.' "
"Frasier: 'Three cheers for Dr. Frasier Crane, who struck a blow against rudeness yesterday in a coffeehouse melee.' Perfect Now all of Seattle knows about my loutish behavior "
"Martin: What are you talking about? This guy had it coming. [doorbell rings] I can just picture it. He probably looked at you and he thought, 'This guy's a creampuff, you know. A wuss... a wimp... a cupcake...' "
"Frasier: Dad "
"Martin: I'm sorry, I'm just so proud of you "
"Niles: Ah, there he is, the man who floats like a lepidoptera and stings like a hymenoptera. "
"Martin: Niles, I think you're just jealous. "
"Niles: Jealous? Don't be ridiculous "
"Martin: This is my favorite part. 'With one swift move the good doctor hoisted the miscreant out on his ear, declaring, 'What you need is an etiquette lesson.'' I love that You got your own tough-guy catchphrase "
"Niles: It's perfect for you, Frasier. Dirty Harry meets Emily Post. "
"Martin: Come on. Show me how you grabbed him. Use Niles. "
"Frasier: No, no Dad. I will not toss Niles about the room. "
"Niles: Oh no, go ahead. Rough me up, Mr. Big Hero Bully Bouncer Did that sound jealous? "
"Frasier: A tad. "
"Niles: Well, all right, I'm jealous. Why shouldn't I be? All my life I've backed out of fights and watching you leap into the fray like that, I... it made me think just once I'd like to experience what you felt - go nose to nose. "
"Martin: Oh, your day will come, son. "
"Niles: I don't know. I tried it this morning with my dry cleaner, Mr. Kim. I decided to give him a good tongue-lashing because he'd shattered the mother-of-pearl buttons on my best waistcoat. Unfortunately, due to his tenuous grasp of English and the fact that his mother's name is Pearl I was forced to flee his establishment amid a shower of coat hangers. "
"Daphne: Good morning, Dr. Crane. And to you, Dr. Crane, our very own knight in shining armor... "
"Niles: Oh, great. "
"Daphne: I want you to know that your assertiveness inspired me. For weeks now, some louse has been removing my wet clothes from the washer and leaving them on the table in a soggy mess. This morning, I decided to get my revenge. So I took off my new red panties and I popped them in with his whites. "
"Niles: Bravo, Daphne. Good for you. God, I wish I'd been there. "
"Frasier: Daphne, don't you think you were overreacting just a bit? "
"Daphne: Absolutely not. Those were my panties and I wasn't afraid to use them. "
"Martin: Fras, why do you keep backing away from this? I mean, you should be proud of yourself. We all think you did the right thing. The newspaper does too. "
"Daphne: That's right. And I'm going to fix you a proper hero's breakfast. "
"Frasier: No. No, no... Daphne. Please, really. It's not necessary. Thank you all. It's just that this isn't sitting well with me. I find it hard to believe any good can come of violence. "
"Frasier: That's it again Mr. Chainsaw. This is Dr. Frasier Crane... "
"Frasier: Go ahead, Daphne. Make my eggs. "
"TO: "
"Frasier: You know, I do wish people would stop making such a fuss. "
"Roz: They will, if you quit walking up and down the hall. You're on in five seconds. "
"Frasier: Oh yes, all right. [puts on headphones and pushes on air button] Hello, this is Dr. Frasier Crane. Who's on the line, Roz? "
"Roz: We have Mitch on line three. He's having trouble with his neighbors. "
"Frasier: Hello, Mitch. "
"Mitch: Make that had trouble. This idiot next door had his leaf-blower going at 7"
":00am, again. "
"Frasier: Oh, that's very inconsiderate. "
"Mitch: I'll say. That's why I decided to give him an 'etiquette lesson.' I grabbed that leaf-blower and smashed it against a tree. "
"Frasier: Mitch, I must say I'm stunned. I can't imagine a more extreme response to such a minor infraction. "
"TO: another caller. Frasier's jacket is off and he is "
"Chris: ...so I snuck into his backyard and shoved a whole pound of rotten shrimp into his air conditioner Come on summer "
"DISSOLVE: another caller goes on... Frasier's sleeves are now rolled "
"Chuck: ...hey, he asked for it. So I put 100 scorpions in a FedEx package. "
"Frasier: Look, I'm sorry, but no matter how provoked you may have been, there is no earthly justification for... SETTING SOMEONE'S LAWN ON FIRE "
"Rochelle: But she doesn't curb her dogs "
"Frasier: Oh... "
"Rochelle: You don't take any guff. Why should I? "
"Frasier: Rochelle... all of you... look, don't you realize that your behavior is just a bit extreme? I displayed a minor bit of force in order to just make a point. I didn't go around smashing windows or torching lawns Where does it end? "
"Rochelle: Are you saying that what I did was wrong? "
"Frasier: Of course I am "
"Rochelle: But what you did was okay? "
"Frasier: No, no I... come to think of it, what I did was just as wrong. I mean, who am I to draw the line at the acceptable level of force? Because the next person moves a little farther, and the next person, a little farther still until we finally end up with scorpions flying through the mail like Christmas bundt cakes What we must all agree to do is to resolve our differences with discussion and reason. As a matter of fact, I'm going to call the gentleman that I manhandled and... and apologize to him for not having worked out our dispute in the right way in the first place- through words. The key here is restraint. And I do hope you'll follow my lead... Becky with the nail gun. "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Oh... people. People, please. There's no need for that. I'm no hero. "
"Niles: No one's ever given me the thumbs up. "
"Frasier: Well, Niles, I've driven on the freeway with you. The rest of the hand has been well-represented. [They sit just as the man Frasier shoved walks in the door.] Oh, look, there he is. Mr. Harvey, I'm so glad you could come. You remember my brother, Niles, and uh... we're at 'our' table. "
"Harvey: Look, I'm here, so say what's on your mind. "
"Frasier: Well, there's no need for any hostility. I just came to talk. "
"Harvey: Talk? You're not gonna take another shot at me? "
"Frasier: No No, they'll be nothing like that here today Now, listen, I could try to explain my behavior by saying that these are stressful times we live in, that I had reached the end of my tether. But I won't do that, because you see, I was 100% wrong. I had absolutely no right to touch you and I accept full responsibility. "
"Harvey: Well, I'm glad to hear you say that. And I hope you all heard that too. "
"Frasier: So, then you accept my apology? "
"Harvey: No, I'm suing you. And I've got a lot of witnesses that just heard you admit you were wrong. "
"Frasier: But, but... these are stressful times we live in and I'd reached the end of my tether "
"Harvey: Tough I'm nailing you for assault "
"Frasier: But I hardly touched you "
"Niles: Oh, Frasier, I'm not surprised he's hiding behind lawyers. What other behavior would you expect... from a chicken? "
"Harvey: What did you say? "
"Niles: I was speaking to my brother. But, to put it in language you can understand... bawk bawk bawk bawk "
"Frasier: Niles This is no time for you to assert yourself "
"Harvey: Hey, your brother's making trouble here... "
"Niles: Oh, oh, oh... what are you gonna do? Flap me with one of your big fluffy wings? "
"Frasier: Niles, stop it Please excuse him "
"Niles: Oh, for god's sake, Frasier don't waste your breath on this hairy, knuckle-dragging, mouth-breathing troglodyte who's probably the only male in existence who suffers from penis envy "
"Harvey: You look here, buddy... "
"Frasier: Niles Niles... are you all right? "
"Niles: Counter suit "
"Frasier: Oh, my god Nobody move him "
"Harvey: I barely touched him "
"Frasier: Then you admit you touched him He admits it Oh, Niles. Niles, I'm here for you. I promise we're going to get you the best care that THIS MAN'S MONEY CAN BUY My god, Niles, that was brilliant. You even got a tear in your eye "
"Niles: I landed on a fork. "

"Frasier: Are your eyes closed? "
"Niles: What is it? "
"Frasier: It's something my antiques scout found for me. Voila [Niles opens his eyes and gapes] Paris, 1882 Designed by Jean- Francois Blon, while attending L'Ecole des Beaux Arts "
"Niles: Mon Dieu It's absolutely breathtaking I'm breathless I need to take a breath. "
"Daphne: Evening, Dr. Crane. "
"Frasier: Would you like to try a game, Niles? "
"Niles: Oh, I think not. It'll make me too melancholy. "
"Frasier: Well, all right. "
"Niles: Maris and I used to play chess every Thursday night. Oh, how she loved the game. "
"Frasier: No wonder — the king is stationary while the queen has all the power. "
"Daphne: How are you getting along, Dr. Crane? "
"Niles: Oh, all right, I guess. "
"Daphne: Feeling a bit lonely, are we? "
"Niles: Only some times when I'm by myself, or other times when I'm with other people. "
"Daphne: It may not be my place to suggest this, but perhaps all you need is a little company at the apartment — something warm and friendly to come home? "
"Niles: Well, I'm sure Dad would miss you. "
"Daphne: Oh, Dr. Crane "
"Niles: Oh, me "
"Daphne: I'm talking about a dog. They're wonderful companions. Just look at how much Eddie's brought to your father's life. "
"Daphne: Oh, there's nothing like a dog's unconditional love. Seeing that smiling face greet you at the door. It's one of the most rewarding relationships a person can have. "
"Daphne: Again? If you're going to drink out of the toilet, you can at least learn to use it. Would you like to come with me? Maybe get the feel of the leash? "
"Niles: Perhaps I will. "
"Niles: You know, Daphne, maybe you're on to something with this dog business. I'm starting to feel less lonely already. "
"Niles: Chop, chop Come with us. "
"Frasier: Oh, hi, Dad. Did you see my new chess set? "
"Martin: Oh yeah, it's nice. "
"Frasier: 'Nice?' Well, the inlay was made from the same Travertine marble they used at the Emperor Hadrian's palace outside Tivoli "
"Martin: Really? Well, I'm gonna celebrate with a beverage brewed from the crystal-clear waters of the majestic Colorado Rockies "
"Frasier: Good one, Dad. Say, how about a game? "
"Martin: Nah, I don't think so. "
"Frasier: Oh, come on, Dad. You know how to play, don't you? "
"Martin: Well, Daphne showed me once. But really, checkers is more my speed. "
"Frasier: Oh, come on, checkers is a kid's game. Come on, Dad I just got it Please? Nobody will play with me "
"Martin: All right, I'll give it another shot. [sits opposite Frasier and pulls his chair up to the table] Those guys at the park make it look great—eating baloney sandwiches, smoking cigars, sometimes a fist-fight even breaks out "
"Frasier: Well, let's just start with name-calling and see where it goes, all right? "
"TO: a While Later. "
"Frasier: Your turn. "
"Frasier: Now, Dad, please, you don't have to rush. As a novice, you have the right to sit back, survey the board, take your time. I will not pressure you or hover like a vulture. Please, feel free to ask any questions you might have. "
"Martin: Is this a checkmate? "
"Frasier: Yes, it is. "
"Martin: You mean I won? "
"Frasier: Well, yes. "
"Martin: Hey, hey I won How do you like that? "
"Frasier: Well, in all fairness, my mind was a bit distracted by having to monitor your side of the board, but, uh... Touche How about another game, Dad? "
"Martin: No, I think one'll do it for me, thanks. "
"Frasier: Well, uh, all right, fair enough. "
"Martin: Boy, I really clobbered you though, didn't I? I got almost all of your prawns. "
"Frasier: Pawns, Dad. "
"Martin: I think the turning point was when I got that tower-thingy. "
"Frasier: Yes, it's called a rook. "
"Martin: But the real knockout blow was when I backed your little horsey-guy into the corner. "
"Frasier: Can we call it a night, Dad? "
"Martin: O.K., when I cornered your knight. "
"Frasier: No, I mean can we call it a night? "
"Roz: Hey, Frasier. "
"Frasier: Oh hi, Roz. "
"Roz: Uh, one double-tall latte, a slice of pecan pie with extra whipped cream. "
"Waitress: Anything else? "
"Frasier: Perhaps a blood-pressure cuff? "
"Roz: I'm just a little nervous today, O.K.? "
"Frasier: Oh, really? Trouble on the dating front? "
"Roz: I'm not that shallow, all right? It's about my hair. I've got an appointment this afternoon with Noge. "
"Frasier: 'Noge?' "
"Roz: He's the hottest hairstylist in Seattle? "
"Frasier: 'Noge?' "
"Roz: I think he's getting a little bored with me. When he cuts my hair, I can't ever think of anything to say "
"Frasier: Well, how's this for an "
"icebreaker: 'Say, Noge, where'd you get such a stupid name?' "
"Roz: You should see him with all of his other clients. They're all laughing, having a wonderful time. I walk in, sit down, it's death. Maybe there's something in here that'll hold his attention. Oh, wow, here's something. A lady in Italy gave birth to a nineteen-pound baby "
"Frasier: Oh my God. "
"Roz: No kidding. She's not going to be hopping on her Vespa anytime soon. "
"Frasier: That's how he did it. "
"Roz: What are you talking about? "
"Frasier: My father beat me at chess last night, and I've just realized now it was sheer dumb luck. He stumbled into the Panoph- Vinick attack "
"Roz: Frasier, I— "
"Frasier: Oh Roz, I can't tell you what a relief this is. My God, my whole world makes sense again. "
"Roz: Frasier, you are forgetting about my problem with Noge. "
"Frasier: Yes, and it'd be a lot easier if you'd stop bringing it up. "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Hello, Niles. "
"Niles: Hello, Frasier. "
"Frasier: To what do I owe this pleasure? "
"Niles: Well, I took to heart Daphne's suggestion the other day about a need for companionship since my separation from Maris, so I went out and got a new lady in my life. "
"Niles: I can't explain it. I'm not a dog person, but there's something about this particular breed that I find comforting and familiar. It's mystifying, isn't it? "
"Frasier: Mmm, baffling. "
"Niles: I-I happened into my local pet shop, and I had no intention of buying anything, I was merely browsing, and they showed me some overly demonstrative puppies. Then I heard a haughty little sniff from a cage in the corner, and there she was She's, uh, she's a bit high strung, but, uh, she's terribly well-bred. When I tried to pet her, she'd have none of it. "
"Frasier: Well, I'm surprised she wasn't snapped up before you got there. "
"Niles: Yes, well, the man at the pet store said it's because people are reluctant to take responsibility for her nerve medicine. "
"Niles: No, not on the couch. Off, off OK. "
"Martin: Hey, Niles. "
"Niles: Hey, Dad. "
"Martin: What the hell is that? "
"Niles: It's my dog, my new best friend. "
"Frasier: Yes, Niles saw her in the pet store and had this inexplicable attraction. "
"Martin: You can see her ribs "
"Frasier: Hit Number One. "
"Niles: Daphne, I owe it all to you. "
"Daphne: Oh really, Dr. Crane, I wouldn't want you going around telling people I was responsible for that. "
"Niles: Well, I guess we'll be toddling along. Come Girl, come OK. [picks her up and carries her to the door] The city streets play havoc with her delicate little feet, so I have to go home and pumice her paw-pads "
"Daphne: Am I the only one? "
"Martin: No. "
"Daphne: Does Dr. Crane have any idea... "
"Martin: No. "
"Frasier: So, Dad, can I, uh, interest you in an ice-cold Ballantine? "
"Martin: Yeah, sounds good. "
"Frasier: You know, I may even join you myself. I've got some pork rinds here and some of that creamy Lipton onion soup dip "
"Martin: Oh, with the seven herbs and spices? "
"Frasier: Well, just count 'em "
"Martin: Hey, that's great All my favorite stuff... you're putting me in a home, aren't you? "
"Frasier: Oh, don't be silly But you know, if I ever had to, don't you think it'd be nice if you knew how to play chess? "
"TO: a While Later. "
"Frasier: Dad, it's not considered a move until my fingers have completely cleared the piece. "
"Martin: Well, what's taking so long? "
"Frasier: I am analyzing my options. Unlike your 'wing-it' approach, I like to plan a strategy, like a general leading his troops into battle. "
"Martin: Checkmate, Schwartzkopf. "
"Frasier: Gosh, that's very well done. You're really getting a feel for the game, Dad. "
"Martin: Yeah, and all this time I thought chess was hard. Well, see ya. "
"Frasier: Sit down, old man, you're not going anywhere "
"TO: A While Later "
"Daphne: Mr. Crane, would you give me a hand with these dishes? "
"Martin: I can't, I'm playing chess with Frasier. "
"Frasier: Finally, my patience will be rewarded. The trap is set. I knew this moment would come "
"Martin: It comes every game. "
"Martin: Checkmate. Well, that's it. Show's over, folks. Move along. Nothing more to see here. "
"Frasier: You know, Dad— "
"Martin: No, no, I'm not playing anymore. I'm tired and I'm going to bed. "
"Frasier: O.K. Yes, I guess I've had my fill as well. Well, this has really turned out to be quite a good idea, hasn't it, this chess thing? "
"Martin: 'Night. "
"Frasier: Awfully relaxing... oh, yes, yes, you just - you just go on ahead, I-I've got - hah - something I've got to do... "
"Roz: Hey, Frasier "
"Frasier: Hi, Roz. "
"Roz: I have great news My appointment with Noge could not have gone better. "
"Frasier: What is the reason behind this miraculous transformation? "
"Roz: Well, it occurred to me that hairstylists love celebrity gossip. And I thought, 'hey, I know a "
"celebrity: you' "
"Frasier: And what did you tell him about me? "
"Roz: Well, he may have gotten the impression that you— [laughs fraudulently] — well, you're gonna love this — that, you know... you may have been... in the past... a woman, you're not mad at me, are you? "
"Frasier: Mad? Why should I be mad, knowing the sacred code of silence all hairdressers have sworn to? "
"Roz: All right, I'll set Noge straight. "
"Frasier: Well, if you manage that, then you really would have a story. "
"Niles: Well, hello. Double cappuccino, please. "
"Frasier: Yeah, same for me, please. Listen, Niles, I need to talk to you about Dad. "
"Niles: Oh yes, how is the Bobby Fischer of the geriatric circuit? "
"Frasier: Well, he's still beating me. I tell you, Niles, I just can't figure it out — I am the superior player. "
"Niles: There's a "
"saying: 'In every boy's life, the moment of greatest joy and greatest sorrow is when he defeats his father for the first time.' "
"Frasier: If you're suggesting that I'm afraid to beat Dad, you can just stop right there. "
"Niles: O.K. The other option is, he's better than you. "
"Frasier: You were saying? "
"Niles: Sooner or later, the son eclipses the father. It's the natural order. Yet it's frequently a stumbling block because the son's competitive stirrings are accompanied by tremendous feelings of guilt. "
"Frasier: I see. Yes, it's the classic Oedipal conflict. It seems so obvious now. I've been letting him win Niles, thank you, thank you very much. I can't tell you what a relief this is. I feel like a weight has been lifted. Nothing can hold me back now. Tonight, I topple the king "
"Niles: Hear, hear. "
"Niles: Of course, you realize by dethroning Dad, you're next in line to be dethroned by Frederick, and then the only thing left after that is death, but that's another day and another cup of coffee. "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Dad? Dad, wake up, it's your turn. "
"Martin: Checkmate. Well, I'm going to bed. "
"Frasier: Oh, come on, Dad, just one more game "
"Martin: No I can't keep my eyes open. "
"Daphne: Playing chess again, were you? "
"Daphne: You know, Dr. Crane, when one of my brothers would lose a soccer match, he'd be all blue and in the dumps. But I could get him to laugh. I'd make a little puppet like so. [moving the puppet's lips; deep, round voice] Hello, Daphne, What's shaking? Oh, hello, Freddy. My friend Dr. Crane here forgot his happy pants Oh, no What should I do? I'd love to. Who's that grouchy gus I see? You can't be grouchy, not with me Sing along, Doc Who's that grouchy gus I see— "
"Frasier: Daphne, I would rather have a tarantula lay eggs in my ear than listen to any more of this puppet show. Do we understand each other? "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Eddie Speak Speak, Eddie "
"Martin: Fire Fire, everybody Frasier Daphne Fire Fire "
"Frasier: What's going on? "
"Martin: The fire alarm went off, but I don't see anything around here "
"Daphne: It's not in my room, either "
"Frasier: It's O.K. My fault, false alarm. I was just a little remiss in replacing the batteries, everything's fine. "
"Daphne: The batteries? No, smoke alarms don't go off if— "
"Frasier: Back to bed "
"Martin: See you in the morning. "
"Frasier: Dad, you know, seeing as how we're both up, I thought maybe we should, oh I dunno, do something, you know? "
"Martin: Like what? "
"Frasier: Well, uh, right off the top of my head, I... well, play a little chess? "
"Martin: Now? "
"Frasier: Well, sure We're both wide awake. "
"Martin: Oh my God, you set that alarm off "
"Frasier: Dad I—I had no— "
"Martin: What kind of weird, competitive freak are you? I mean, you really hate to lose so much that you wake up the whole house and scare us all to death? "
"Frasier: No, of course not And I wouldn't have to resort to such lengths if this damn dog could learn to speak Oh, of course, now you'll get it right Look, Dad, would one more game kill you? I mean, you're all riled up. My God, you'll never get to sleep now anyway "
"Martin: Wait a minute. This isn't about losing, is it? This is about losing to me. That's what's driving you nuts 'How could I lose to the old man? I'm much smarter than he is' "
"Frasier: I never said that "
"Martin: No, you didn't have to say it, you've thought it all your life "
"Frasier: No, I haven't "
"Martin: Yes, you have, and now you're insulting my intelligence again "
"Frasier: Oh, Dad "
"Martin: Hey, now listen, what do you think I was doing as a detective all those years? Analyzing clues, devising strategies, trying to stay one or two steps ahead of the other guys — now, does that sound like any game that you know? "
"Frasier: All right, that explains why you can play the game, but not why you beat me every time Now, come on, just one more game, please? Dad, look, I'll never bring it up again Come on "
"Martin: No. Why should I? You just want to beat me so that you can go back to thinking you're smarter than your stupid old man. Well, forget it, to hell with you. I don't see any reason why I should ever play you again. "
"Frasier: If you win, I'll give you five thousand dollars. "
"Martin: Get out of my way. "
"Martin: Well, look at that, the board's all set up What a surprise. "
"Frasier: I took the liberty. Now, Dad, I think we can sit down and play a nice cordial little game. For centuries, people have set aside their differences to play a game of chess. So, who should go first? "
"Martin: Well, let's see. It's usually the person who lost the last game. Now, who could that be? "
"Frasier: OK. No more Mr. Cordial Guy "
"Later: the game has advanced. "
"Martin: By the way, I'm sorry the ratings for your show took a dive last month. "
"Frasier: Don't try to pull your cheap psychological tricks on me. "
"Frasier: Oh, did I mention... the cemetery called? Apparently they have to dig a sewer next to your plot. "
"Later: "
"Frasier: Getting your dog to stare at me only proves how desperate you are. "
"Martin: I didn't tell him to do that. He just gets fascinated when he sees people sweat. "
"Frasier: I sweat when I'm happy. "
"Martin: Well, then you must be ecstatic No, wait "
"Frasier: No, no, you took your finger off that piece "
"Martin: No, I didn't "
"Frasier: Yes, you did That means that you must not trust that move, must have left yourself vulnerable somewhere. "
"Martin: Well, even if I did, you'll never find it. "
"Frasier: Oh, look at that... what's this? I won, I won, I really won "
"Martin: Hey, I didn't gloat when I beat you all those times "
"Frasier: No, but, I bet you wish you did now, huh? Ha-ha, it feels great "
"Martin: All right, that's it. I'm going to bed. And I never want to hear the word 'chess,' or 'board,' or 'chessboard' again That's it, got it? "
"Frasier: Fine. Fine, Dad. Goodnight. Geez, lighten up It's only a game "
"TO: "
"Night: "
"Frasier: Dad? Dad? "
"Martin: Oh, jeez... "
"Frasier: No, no, please, just one "
"question: did you let me win? "
"Martin: Oh, for crying out loud, Frasier... "
"Frasier: No, no, please, did you play your best? "
"Martin: For five thousand bucks? What do you think? "
"Frasier: You wouldn't just be saying that? "
"Martin: On your mother's grave, may lightning strike me down, I, Martin Crane, swear on the holiest of Bibles, you won, I lost, fair and square, cross my heart and hope to go to sleep. "
"Frasier: Thank you, Dad. "
"Martin: You're welcome. "
"Frasier: I'm sorry I beat you, Dad. "

"Martin: Oh, how does he always hear me? "
"Daphne: He doesn't. He just swings through every twenty minutes. He knows you'll be eating some kind of junk. "
"Martin: Well, I don't want him eating these. "
"Daphne: Well, then do what I do when I want Eddie away from me. I make a sound like La la la la la la la la la la la "
"Martin: That's mean "
"Daphne: Why? It doesn't really hurt his ears. He just finds certain noises irritating. "
"Frasier: That was the most riveting production of Wagner I have seen this season. "
"Niles: I still have goose bumps from when Klingsor summoned Kundry with a terrible cry and ordered her to seduce "
"Parsifal: 'Ha Er Ist Shun Der Knabe' "
"Martin: Well, I had a pretty good night too. Took myself a nice, hot bath. And, remember that corn I had on my toe? Well, it got so soft I was just able to peel it right off. "
"Niles: Um... it's going to be difficult for me to top that, but I have some rather exciting news myself. I'm sure you're all familiar with the Safford case that's been in the papers recently? "
"Martin: Oh, you mean that scum-sucking jerk who's trying to get his father committed? "
"Niles: Yes. Well, guess who's been retained by that scum-sucking jerk I'm going to be testifying as an expert witness at Mr. Safford's capacity hearing. "
"Martin: Wait a minute. You're gonna help sell that poor old guy down the river? "
"Niles: Not at all. Mr. Safford is unbalanced. His son is worried sick about him. "
"Martin: Oh, his son's worried he's not gonna get his hands on his father's fortune. Boy, the minute a man starts getting up there his kids start making plans to divvy up his stuff. "
"Frasier: Dad, you'll be pleased to know that Niles and I have decided to give all your things to charity. We're donating your clothes to the blind. "
"Martin: Well, it's just not right. A bunch of moneygrubbers behind closed doors trying to declare this poor old guy insane. "
"Niles: For starters, it's not behind closed doors. The entire proceeding will be broadcast on Court TV. "
"Martin: Oh, great. What father doesn't look forward to the day he gathers his friends around the TV and says, 'Hey, that's my boy. The one making the old man cry.' "
"Frasier: Dad, I'm sure Niles is only doing this to protect Mr. Safford from himself. "
"Daphne: Old age doesn't have to be that way, you know. My great-aunt Beryl lived well into her nineties, and her mind never failed her. Of course, she lost her eyesight in her seventies, and her balance in her eighties. By the end we spent most of our time propping her up or putting another bandage on her forehead. Oh, but bless her heart, she could always tell you just how it happened. "
"Niles: Well, Safford is clearly irrational. Recently, he wandered off. They found him two days later riding across Wyoming in a boxcar full of bums; he's taken to selling off property for half its worth; and most damning of all, when I went over to evaluate him, he continually referred to me as 'Sparky.' "
"Frasier: I don't know, Niles, you always wanted to have a nickname. You remember your campaign to have the string section of the youth orchestra call you 'Rocky?' "
"Niles: It would have worked, too, if Tilly Farraday hadn't pinned me to the ground with her trombone when I rebuked her for neglecting to clean her spit valve. "
"Martin: Well, I still think picking on the old man stinks. [gets up and moves to the dining table to get a chip] God help you if you're over fifty and you do anything that seems the least bit odd to your family. "
"Beth: And I'm pretty sure he's having an affair with his secretary. "
"Frasier: Well, have you talked to your husband and heard his side of the story? "
"Beth: No. "
"Frasier: Well, Beth, it does seem that your fears may be well-founded, but I still think you should talk to your husband before you come to any final conclusions. This is Dr. Frasier Crane, wishing you good day, and good mental health. "
"Roz: Here are those PSAs, we'll do them tomorrow before the show. "
"Frasier: Thank you, Roz. Roz, why is that light still on? Is that Beth who I was talking to? "
"Roz: No "
"Frasier: Yes, it is "
"Roz: No, it isn't "
"Frasier: Yes, it is "
"Roz: It is not "
"Frasier: Have you been talking to Beth? "
"Roz: Of course not What do you think - I'm giving advice to your callers? Oh, Frasier, you are so paranoid. The world is full of enemies. Everybody's plotting against you. [notices a man walk in] There's a man in a dark trench coat right behind you. "
"Frasier: Ho-ho, very droll. "
"Giroux: Dr. Crane? I'm John Giroux. [hands Frasier his card] I work for Harlow Safford. "
"Frasier: Oh, Mr. Giroux, I'm afraid there's been some mistake. It's my brother who's connected with the case. "
"Giroux: Oh, we're quite aware of that, but Mr. Safford feels he's the victim of a grave injustice. He's an ardent fan of your show and feels you're the only man who can help him. "
"Frasier: Well, that's very flattering, but given my brother's connection with the case, it wouldn't be very prudent for me to get involved. "
"Giroux: Won't you at least talk to my client? Judge him by his words and his actions, not by how old he is? "
"Frasier: You sound like my father - a man who believes that burial is a form of age discrimination. "
"Giroux: If you stop by this evening, I'm convinced you'll find Mr. Safford is completely competent. Even if you won't testify on his behalf, perhaps you could at least get your brother to reconsider his testimony. "
"Frasier: It's highly unlikely that I would disagree with my brother's opinion. "
"Giroux: I really admired your advice to that last caller - you know, about not judging someone until you've heard his side of the story? "
"Frasier: You're a good lawyer, Mr. Giroux. "
"Giroux: Mr. Safford only seeks out the very best. "
"Frasier: I'll see you at seven? "
"Giroux: The address is on the back of my card. "
"Roz: I don't care what Dr. Crane said. You start talking to your husband and he'll start covering his tracks. Get a detective now. "
"Frasier: You were talking to my last caller. "
"Roz: I swear; it's the first and last time. I will never do it again. "
"Frasier: I hope not. "
"Roz: Thanks for holding, Bill. I'm listening. "
"Giroux: Enjoy your tour? "
"Frasier: Uh... yes, yes. That's quite a model railroad Mr. Safford has running through the grounds. I've never seen one on quite that scale. "
"Giroux: Impressive, isn't it? "
"Frasier: Oh, yes. Yes, especially when it's bearing down on you. I got my heels stuck in the soft grass. I barely made the crossing. Tell me, how often does Mr. Safford... play with his train? "
"Giroux: Just the weekends, when he gives rides to underprivileged children. "
"Frasier: Very admirable. "
"Giroux: There's a lot you don't know about him, Dr. Crane. That's why you're here. "
"Frasier: Yes, well, I promise to consider all the evidence before I arrive at a conclusion. ' Frasier turns to see an "
"Frasier: I think I've arrived. "
"Harlow: Hiya, Sparky. I'm Harlow Safford. "
"Frasier: Dr. Frasier Crane. I don't believe I've ever seen a fire pole in a home before. "
"Harlow: Oh, it saves a lot of time. Except for going up, of course. "
"Frasier: And, uh, the hat? "
"Harlow: Oh, it's just for laughs. Oh, try it on. "
"Frasier: Well, no, I don't think I should. "
"Harlow: Oh, come on "
"Frasier: I guess it is sort of fun, isn't it? "
"Harlow: Not on you. So, do you think you can convince my self-righteous son that I'm not nuts? "
"Frasier: Oh, I think 'nuts' is a little strong. He must have meant that your behavior might seem to most people to be a little unconventional. "
"Harlow: Well, good. I've spent my whole life being conventional. Then one day I said to myself, 'Harlow, you're not having any fun.' "
"Frasier: Do you... speak to yourself often? "
"Harlow: Don't try to trip me up, Sparky. [he walks over to Frasier, carrying a cigar box] "
"Frasier: Oh, no, thank you. Thank you, I'm trying to cut down on... lollipops. Thank you. But tell me, why do you call people 'Sparky'? "
"Harlow: It makes them smile. Right, Sparky? You ought to try it with your patients. "
"Frasier: Oh, I'm not too sure how warmly that would be embraced by those undergoing electroshock. "
"Frasier: Um, anyway, your son tells me that you recently sold some property at a fraction of its value. "
"Harlow: That's right. Terrific young married couple had their hearts set on it, but couldn't afford it. So, I helped them out. There's nothing wrong with helping people. "
"Frasier: Well, he also informed me that you recently indulged in an unorthodox, not to mention hazardous mode of travel. "
"Harlow: That pompous weenie. That's exactly how he would put it. "
"Frasier: Well, actually, that was my wording. "
"Harlow: Well, I hopped a freight. Rode the rails. "
"Frasier: Well, why not just purchase a ticket and ride in a club car? "
"Harlow: Where's the adventure in that? I'm 78. Someday I'll be too old to jump off a moving train No, you gotta live out your fantasies while you can. Can you understand that? "
"Frasier: I think I can. Mr. Safford, what you've said makes a great deal of sense. Before we go on, there's something I have to ask you. "
"Harlow: Shoot. "
"Frasier: It's a little embarrassing. "
"Harlow: I can take it. "
"Frasier: Okay. Can I slide down that pole? "
"Harlow: Follow me, Sparky "
"Frasier: Dad, are you going to watch something now? "
"Martin: Yeah, the championship fight. But don't worry, I'm using my earphones, I won't bother anyone. "
"Daphne: Oh, you've already been a bother - making me hide the sports section so he won't see it. Making me turn the news off because they might say who won. "
"Frasier: I don't understand. "
"Martin: Well, the fight was last night. It was on Pay TV. But one of my police buddies has a pirate antenna. So, he taped it and they messengered one to me in an envelope marked 'Official Business.' "
"Frasier: Another inspiring tale of our men in law enforcement. "
"Martin: Why are you walking funny? "
"Frasier: Well, suffice it to say I learned today it is unwise to slide repeatedly down a fire pole wearing woolen trousers. Daphne, would you...? "
"Daphne: Oh, I'll get it. "
"Niles: Evening, Daphne. "
"Daphne: Oh, Dr. Crane, don't say anything about last night's boxing match. Your dad hasn't seen it yet. "
"Niles: Oh, I didn't even know it was boxing season. [Daphne just smiles] Well, did everyone see my mention in this morning's paper? "
"Frasier: No, I'm afraid I missed that. "
"Niles: Well, small wonder. They buried it all the way back on page 32. It's here, it's next to the sports section. "
"Martin: Hey, get that out of here "
"Daphne: Let me see. "
"Niles: It's right there. "
"Daphne: Oh. 'Court TV this week will feature the capacity hearing of noted timber baron Harlow Safford. [Martin glares at Niles] Testifying on behalf of the family will be Dr. Niles Crane, eminent psychiatrist, author and leading authority on clinical psychosis. Dr. Crane is also the brother of...' "
"Niles: Yadda-yadda, the rest is filler. "
"Frasier: Niles, I have to talk to you about something. Just after the show today I was visited by a man named Mr. Giroux. He asked me to represent Mr. Safford. "
"Niles: What? "
"Martin: Shh "
"Frasier: I'm sorry. Given your involvement with the case, I naturally declined. "
"Niles: Oh, thank God. "
"Frasier: But, I did agree to see if I concurred with your analysis and speak to Mr. Safford. "
"Niles: What? "
"Martin: Hey, keep it down "
"Frasier: I just have to tell you that I found Harlow Safford to be of completely sound mind - and don't say 'What?' "
"Niles: Why? "
"Martin: Quiet "
"Frasier: Perhaps it'd be better if we spoke somewhere else. "
"Niles: You couldn't stand that I had a high-profile case, could you? So you had to butt into it "
"Frasier: I just don't want you to make a fool of yourself. These people came to me, they asked for my expertise. "
"Niles: Oh, ha They were undoubtedly exploiting your dubious celebrity. "
"Frasier: Of which you are jealous and, I fear, the reason you took this case "
"Niles: That is flatly untrue I took the case to help the family "
"Frasier: And to be on television "
"Niles: I don't give a hoot about television "
"Martin: Well, some of us do "
"Frasier: Niles, you made a hasty judgment and I am sorry, but you were wrong. "
"Niles: Ah, now we see why you got involved in the case - so big brother could be right and little Niles could be wrong, which I'm not "
"Frasier: Oh, your pathetic childhood issues have nothing to do with it. Face it, you were wrong Wrong, wrong, wrong "
"Niles: Oh, oh, oh- "
"Niles: This from Mr. Quick-Fix, the master of the in-depth, one- minute phone call diagnosis "
"Frasier: I spent several hours with Mr. Safford and I found his behavior to be... "
"Niles: Wildly irrational. He's a lip-diddling loon "
"Frasier: You think anything that's even slightly spontaneous is aberrant. "
"Niles: That's ridiculous The man's incompetent "
"Frasier: Niles, I'm warning you. If you get up in that courtroom and say that, you will damage yourself professionally "
"Niles: I'm testifying, and you're not going to stop me "
"Frasier: Fine, then you leave me no choice but to testify against you "
"Niles: Well, in that case, I'll see you in court "
"Frasier: Good, I look forward to it "
"Niles: So do I "
"Frasier: Good "
"Niles: Good "
"Martin: HEY "
"Frasier: Daphne, please. Turn down that radio. Dad is trying to watch a fight "
"TO: "
"Frasier: So, how are you holding up? "
"Harlow: Oh, I'm fine. Now look, Sparky. I know you don't want to take any money for helping me. But at least let me make a donation to your favorite charity. "
"Frasier: Well... it was my duty, not to mention a pleasure, to help you. But if you'd like to donate something, why don't you select a charity of your own choosing? "
"Harlow: Fair enough. "
"Frasier: Good. Excuse me. "
"Frasier: Hello, Niles. You know, it's not to late to ask them to put a big blue ball in front of your face during the broadcast. Perhaps spare you some shred of your reputation. "
"Niles: I'd laugh in your face but I'm saving my voice. [clears throat] "
"Frasier: Oh my God You're wearing makeup "
"Niles: I am not This is... medication. Something my dermatologist recommended. "
"Frasier: Dr. Revlon? "
"Niles: These feeble attempts to undermine my confidence are futile. The testimony I've prepared is nothing short of brilliant. I cite half a dozen studies of gerontology. I quote everything from the Bible to Herodotus. I deftly interweave humor with pathos. You may want to take notes. "
"Frasier: And if you had an ounce of self-awareness you would realize that your diagnosis was colored by your zeal to put your face in front of that camera. Oh, by the way, your medication is rubbing off on your collar. "
"Baliff: All rise. Court is in session. Judge Richard McCarron presiding. "
"Niles: Hello, your honor. "
"Judge: Be seated. Good morning. Has everyone been sworn in? "
"Baliff: Yes, your honor. "
"Judge: Well, I see we have two Dr. Cranes testifying today. [Niles stands, then sits back down.] Mr. Giroux, I think we'll hear from your authority first. I assume the other Dr. Crane has no objection to that arrangement? "
"Niles: None whatsoever, your honor. "
"Judge: I'm over here, Dr. Crane. "
"Frasier: Your honor, I would not presume to bore the court with a recitation of dry statistics, gerontology studies, obscure literary references. "
"Frasier: Instead, I intend to speak from the heart. I worry about a society that has chosen to define normalcy in such narrow terms that if someone's behavior deviates ever so slightly, we question his capacity to function. Mr. Safford's seeming eccentricities - his love of trains, his generosity - they can all be readily explained. "
"Harlow: Diabetes "
"Judge: Mr. Safford? "
"Harlow: I was talking to Sparky. "
"Frasier: Uh... Did you say diabetes? "
"Harlow: Yes. We'll donate the money to diabetes. Those poor people can't eat sugar "
"Frasier: Fine.. fine. Uh... we'll, uh... we'll talk about it afterwards. "
"Judge: May we continue, Dr. Crane? "
"Frasier: My apologies, your honor. Mr. Safford and I were discussing a very sizable donation he intends to make later today to a very worthy cause. I guess his enthusiasm just got the best of him. But, it is this very generosity that his son finds so objectionable. That, and the fact that he did hop a freight train across the country. But, you see, what he sees as unstable, I see as... romantic. "
"Frasier: I... I don't suppose there's a railroad track outside the courtroom? "
"Frasier: Uh... doesn't Mr. Safford deserve to be a bit of a free spirit after the years of his demanding career? A career in which he wore... many hats. Um... the hat of a father, a philanthropist, a C.E.O... "
"Harlow: All aboard All aboard Get your tickets ready. Have your tickets ready, please. Have your tickets ready. "
"Frasier: In the end, it all comes down to "
"this: can we really condemn a man for maintaining a childlike joie de vivre even in his twilight years? "
"Harlow: All aboard for the Coast Express. Yes, making stops in Tacoma, Olympia, Portland and Salem. And the next stop is... "
"Frasier: I think I know where your next stop is going to be. "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Now, look, Niles. Before you start gloating, let me just say this. You were right, I was wrong. "
"Niles: Big deal. The world never got a chance to hear me be right. I suppose by now it's obvious that what you were saying all along was true. I do... envy your fame. Well, perhaps this public humiliation will cure me of my damned competitiveness. "
"Frasier: Oh, don't worry about it. I humiliated myself far more than you did today. "
"Niles: Obviously, you didn't see the way I was whoring after that TV camera. "
"Frasier: Obviously, you didn't see how I was tap dancing up there like an organ grinder's monkey. "
"Niles: Yes, well, I might as well have been tarred and feathered. "
"Frasier: I might as well have been pilloried in the town square. "
"Niles: I might as well have been stripped naked and forced to... "
"Frasier: Oh, stop it, Niles We're doing it again Niles, you have no reason to feel badly. Everyone wants to be recognized for something they're good at. And you are a good psychiatrist. "
"Niles: Thank you, Frasier. "
"Frasier: Something I can't really lay claim to after today. How could I have so misjudged that man? "
"Niles: Well, he's undeniably charming for one thing. And he can be lucid for long stretches of time. "
"Frasier: Yes, but you weren't fooled. Somehow, you picked up on some tiny clue that I missed. You remember what it was? "
"Niles: Yes. Midway through our interview he took off his trousers and tried to put them on the cat. "
"Frasier: Well, I'd like to think that I might have picked up on that one too. Still... "
"Niles: Frasier, you've always approached life with a positive attitude. It's a quality I admire of yours. Perhaps your judgment was clouded by your desire to see old age not as a time of inevitable decline, but as a time when one's childhood passions and fantasies can be reborn. "
"Frasier: Thank you, Niles. You know what would cheer me up right now? "
"Niles: What? "
"Frasier: I would like to hear that summation you never got a chance to give. "
"Niles: Really? "
"Frasier: Yes. "
"Niles: You're not just saying that? "
"Frasier: Do you care? "
"Niles: No "
"Frasier: Well, all right then. I'm the judge I'm the judge "
"Niles: Okay, you be the judge. "
"Frasier: All rise. "
"Niles: Yes, here we are. "
"Frasier: Yes we have, your honor. Dr. Crane, proceed. "
"Niles: Your honor, I believe it was Herodotus who "
"said: 'Circumstances rule men. Men do not rule circumstances.' "

"Frasier: I'm driving "
"Roz: Fine Hand me my jeans, will you? "
"Frasier: Here. Oh, oh, great There's a police car behind us. Please don't turn on the red light. Don't turn on the red light. Don't turn on the— "
"Roz: Damn it, Frasier Don't worry, you're not going to get a ticket. You're a celebrity, use a little juice "
"Frasier: Oh, I refuse to do anything of the sort "
"Roz: OK, fine. Enjoy traffic school. "
"Frasier: Hello, officer. I'm listening. "
"Cop: I clocked you doing sixty-two in a forty-mile zone. "
"Cop: Well, this is interesting. Usually both people are in the backseat. "
"Frasier: It's not what you think. See, we were just coming back from KACL, where I do my radio show. "
"Cop: Uh-huh. "
"Frasier: You see, we ran a little late, because I was on with a very troubled caller, with a very complex psychological problem... on my radio show. "
"Cop: Hey, wait a minute. You're Dr. Frasier Crane "
"Frasier: Drat My cover is blown. "
"Cop: I love your show I listen to it all the time. "
"Frasier: Oh well, thank you. It's always nice to— "
"Cop: License and registration, please. "
"Frasier: Be arrested by a fan. "
"Frasier: Roz, if you could delay ablutions? I'm in custody here "
"Cop: Hey, it's your birthday today. Is this a little celebration? "
"Frasier: No, no, I'm simply taking my producer to meet her date. "
"Roz: Frasier, why didn't you tell me it was your birthday? I'd have thrown you a party at the station "
"Frasier: Question asked, question answered. I'm just going to be dropping her off, then have a cold plate of deli, and get to bed early. Almost makes you feel sorry for me, doesn't it? "
"Cop: I spent my last birthday subduing a drunk-and-disorderly at a sleazy bar. "
"Frasier: Don't you hate to work on your birthday? "
"Cop: He was my date. Tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to let you off. Just think of this as a little birthday gift from me. "
"Frasier: Thank you. "
"Cop: But slow down. I'd hate to see you get hurt. "
"Frasier: I'm listening. "
"Roz: OK, let's go "
"Frasier: Do you sense a little moment there? "
"Roz: What are you talking about? "
"Frasier: Well, between me and that very attractive officer. It just felt like there was something there. "
"Roz: Yeah, major sparks. Now, just the right pedal. The big pedal— "
"Frasier: Now, just a minute. We'll see if she's watching me. If she's watching me, she's interested. Oh, yes She's turning around, she's looking up "
"Cop: Move your vehicle "
"Frasier: Oh, yes. I've cast my spell. "
"Daphne: Go on, Dr. Crane, make a wish. "
"Frasier: Oh, why bother? I made the same wish last year, it didn't come true. "
"Martin: Come on, son, blow out the candles "
"Frasier: Oh, what a surprise. Look, they're lighting again What sorcerer's magic is this? You know, Dad, I had a nice little birthday bonus today. On my way home, I was pulled over for speeding by a very pretty policewoman, who let me off. I got the distinct impression that she found me attractive. Now, that sort of thing happens, doesn't it? "
"Martin: Oh, sure. I was always leaning against somebody's window thinking, 'that bloody chainsaw in the backseat looks kind of iffy, but she's got a cute smile' "
"Frasier: Oh, ha, ha. I'm telling you, there was something there, though. Well, of course the whole conversation's academic. I don't even know her name. I suppose I could call down to the police station and try to find out who was on traffic duty. But, uh, I don't suppose they'd give that sort of information to a civilian. You'd have to have some... conduit to the police department, an insider who could break that damnable code of silence "
"Martin: All right, I'll make the damn call. "
"Frasier: You, Dad? Why, I didn't even think of— "
"Martin: Oh, shut up. "
"Frasier: You know, I haven't felt such an instant attraction to a woman in quite some time. Well, considering the difference in our backgrounds, it's really rather puzzling. "
"Niles: Oh, pish-tosh It's painfully obvious what's attracting you — the gleam of her jackboots, her dangling nightstick, the glint of her handcuffs hanging on her leather belt. You're off on some lurid little disciplinary fantasy. "
"Daphne: Oh, Dr. Crane, shame on you You got icing up and down your sleeve "
"Niles: Oh. I am a naughty boy. "
"Daphne: Well, certainly a messy one. "
"Niles: But mainly a naughty one. "
"Martin: Hey, Charlie, yeah, Marty Crane, how ya doing? Hey, listen, Charlie, I'm trying to track down a woman officer who was on traffic tonight, uh, near... "
"Frasier: Blanchett and Fourth. "
"Martin: Blanchett and Fourth. Great, OK, thanks. Her name's Maureen Cutler, and she usually goes to McGinty's after work. Charlie said she's probably there now. "
"Frasier: Thanks, Dad. "
"Martin: Are you going to go? "
"Frasier: Well, I don't know. A police bar? If I go in there alone, I'll stand out like a sore thumb "
"Niles: All right, I'll go. "
"Martin: Sit down, Niles, I'll go with him. You know, after all these hoity-toity, caviar-sucking egghead types you've been dating, I think a lady cop would be a nice breath of fresh air. "
"Frasier: Oh, all right, I'll go Give me a second, I'll put some fresh collar-stays in, and-oh, oh, I've got a fabulous brand-new cashmere jacket I've been dying to premiere "
"Martin: Oh, yeah. This is gonna work. "
"TO: "
"Martin: You see her yet? "
"Frasier: I don't know. "
"Martin: What about her? "
"Frasier: No, that's not Maureen. "
"Martin: No, I mean, what about her? "
"Frasier: Oh, there she is "
"Martin: Wow, she is a looker Well, come on, let's go say hello. "
"Frasier: Oh well Oh my God, fancy seeing you here "
"Maureen: Hey, Frasier Crane. "
"Frasier: Oh, you remember me? "
"Maureen: Come on — sixty-two in a forty-mile zone with a half-naked girl in the backseat? "
"Frasier: Roz. "
"Martin: Oh. "
"Frasier: Oh, uh, this is my father. "
"Maureen: How do you do? I'm Maureen Cutler. "
"Martin: Marty Crane, nice to meet you. "
"Maureen: Nice to meet you. "
"Martin: Say, Maureen, how about a drink? "
"Maureen: Yeah, why not? "
"Frasier: Let me get them. I'm a beer drinker myself, what about you? "
"Maureen: That's fine by me. "
"Martin: Beer, huh? Oh, what the hell, I'll try one. "
"Maureen: So, what brings you guys here? This is mostly a cop hangout. "
"Martin: Well, I used to be on the force. "
"Maureen: Really? "
"Martin: Yeah. "
"Maureen: Wait a minute. Marty Crane? You're Martin Crane "
"Martin: You're wasting your time in traffic, you're quite a detective. "
"Maureen: No, I mean I remember you when I was training. You gave this great lecture at the academy on how to deal with an armed suspect. "
"Martin: Well, thanks. "
"Maureen: How come you left the force? "
"Martin: Well, I uh, got shot by an armed suspect. "
"Maureen: I'm sorry. "
"Martin: Oh, it's all right. "
"Maureen: So, do you miss it? "
"Martin: Nah, how attached can you get to a hip? "
"Maureen: Oh. Oh, I'm sorry. I have to get over to the hospital. I told them to beep me if there was any news about my sergeant. "
"Martin: What happened to him? "
"Maureen: She's having a baby. "
"Martin: Oh well, hope it's a girl Yeah, I'll tell Frasier you had to run. "
"Maureen: Thanks... listen, um, I never do this, but I would love to have a beer or go to dinner sometime. "
"Martin: With me? "
"Maureen: I don't want to put you on the spot. If you, uh, if you want to go out, just give me a call. "
"Martin: With me? "
"Maureen: You're the only one here. "
"Frasier: Here we are Three beers. Good news, there was a fly in one glass, so these are free "
"Maureen: I'm sorry, I just got beeped. "
"Frasier: Oh, that's too bad. "
"Maureen: Yeah, but it was nice to see you. Maybe I'll bump into you again here sometime. "
"Frasier: Oh, that'd be great. "
"Maureen: OK, bye. "
"Frasier: Bye. "
"Frasier: Well, I think that went very well, don't you? "
"Niles: I'll have a grande half-caf latte, with a whisper of cinnamon. And for my father, plain coffee. I cannot emphasize the word 'plain' enough. No foam, no cinnamon, no exotic flavors. If it is not plain, I take no responsibility for the consequences. "
"Waitress: How about a biscotti? "
"Niles: All right. But when you bring it, call it a cookie. "
"Martin: Hi, son. "
"Niles: Hello, Dad. "
"Martin: Uh, I want to thank you for meeting me like this. "
"Niles: Well, my pleasure. So... what can I do you for? "
"Martin: Well, I need some advice. "
"Niles: That's why you asked me here? "
"Martin: Yeah. "
"Niles: You've never done this before "
"Martin: Yeah, well, I'm sorry. But anyway, you remember— "
"Niles: Dad, I want you to know I'm not only deeply touched, but I consider this a watershed moment in our relationship "
"Martin: Great. See, the thing is— "
"Niles: All my life, it seems you've always turned to Frasier. 'Frasier, Frasier, Frasier' "
"Martin: Niles, can I talk? "
"Niles: I'm listening. "
"Waitress: Here we are. One latte, one coffee, and one [looks at Niles] 'cookie.' "
"Martin: I think they call this thing a biscotti. "
"Niles: No need to talk down to the man. Off you go "
"Martin: Well, anyway, uh, you remember the other night, Frasier's policewoman? "
"Niles: Mmm-hmm. "
"Martin: Well, we found her at the bar, and, uh, well, she came on to me. "
"Niles: No. "
"Martin: Yeah. "
"Niles: You? "
"Martin: Yeah. "
"Niles: Was she drunk? Oh, I'm sorry, Dad, of course, you're right, I'm sorry. Uh, [barely able to contain his delight] what was Frasier's reaction? "
"Martin: I haven't told him yet. "
"Niles: Why not? "
"Martin: I just can't. "
"Niles: Can I? "
"Martin: I know he's going to feel lousy. He finally meets a girl he likes, and she's attracted to his old man. "
"Niles: Hmm, that is quite a conundrum. I wonder if that's what's really bothering you. "
"Martin: What do you mean? "
"Niles: Maybe, underneath it all, you're attracted to this woman and you want to go out with her. "
"Martin: Oh, are you, nuts? That's sick That's disgusting "
"Martin: But for the sake of argument, let's say you're right. "
"Niles: Dad, you're allowed to be attracted to a woman. "
"Martin: What kind of a father does a thing like that? "
"Niles: Did you encourage her in any way? "
"Martin: Well, I guess I was kind of charming. I mean, I didn't mean to be It just sometimes leaks out. "
"Niles: Well, what do you want to do? "
"Martin: Well, most important I don't want to hurt Frasier. And secondly, I want to go out with Maureen. The order of that changes depending on the time of day. "
"Niles: Well, one possibility is, go on a date with her. If you feel there are sparks between you and this woman, then tell Frasier. "
"Martin: I don't want to lie to my son. "
"Niles: You're not lying to him. You're delaying the truth to spare his feelings. If nothing happens, he need never know. "
"Martin: Well, I guess it's worth a try. If Maureen and I hit it off, then I'll tell him immediately. "
"Niles: Or I can. Really, I don't mind "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Hi, Dad. "
"Martin: Oh, Frasier You're still home. "
"Frasier: Yeah. Where are you going? "
"Martin: Just out. "
"Frasier: What are you gonna do? "
"Martin: Nothing. "
"Frasier: When are you gonna be home? "
"Martin: Later. "
"Frasier: Well, you put a dent in the car, young man, it's coming out of your allowance "
"Charlotte: I mean, I've got my pride, you know. So, I said to her, I said, 'Mrs. Crease, I'll do the cooking, I'll do the cleaning, but I draw the line at creaming your feet' "
"Charlotte: Dear, hurry up 'The Mambo Kings' is about to start "
"Daphne: Oh, I wouldn't mind mamboing with Antonio Banderas All right, set out the goodies and I'll go get the wine. "
"Daphne: Oh, and this time, Charlotte, be careful with that chocolate I had a hell of a time hiding the stain from His Nibs— Oh, hello, Dr. Crane "
"Frasier: Daphne. Charlotte, Maggie. "
"Maggie: Dr. Crane. "
"Frasier: Please, sit down. "
"Daphne: I thought you were filling in at the station tonight. "
"Frasier: Oh, I am. But, uh, not for a couple of hours yet. ' "
"Daphne: Oh-ho, seems a shame to hang around here. I mean, I would have thought you'd have taken an opportunity like this to, I don't know... go down to McGinty's? "
"Charlotte: Oh, to see his new lady friend, you mean? "
"Frasier: Ah, well, I see I've been quite the hot topic over the teapot. "
"Daphne: You know, I may have said a thing or two in passing, but— "
"Charlotte: I'd go for it, Dr. Crane "
"Frasier: Yes, well, if you must know, I was planning to go down there, but not for a couple of days yet. "
"Charlotte: Well, I wouldn't wait too long. I mean, strike while the iron's hot, that's what I always say "
"Daphne: She's right. "
"Frasier: Well, women don't really like men that are too overeager. "
"Daphne: Oh, nonsense. I mean, you know, it's one thing if the man's some bounder git from the docks, but it's different if the man's like you. "
"Maggie: Someone who's charming. "
"Charlotte: And handsome. "
"Daphne: And knows lots and lots of words. "
"Frasier: Well, McGinty's is on my way to the station. I suppose I could just pop my head in. [picks up his briefcase and goes to the door] Thank you, ladies, for your support — even if it was nakedly self-serving and insincere. "
"TO: "
"Maureen: So, they finally put my transfer through, and I'm moving out of Traffic and into Narcotics. Yeah, I'm gonna be working with, uh, Bill Henderson at the 31st. "
"Martin: Good for you. "
"Maureen: Yeah, I'm excited, although I hear he can be pretty tough. "
"Martin: Oh no. I mean, he might seem a little stiff and strait-laced, but once you get to know him he's the greatest guy in the world. "
"Maureen: Yeah, he is pretty impressive. "
"Martin: Oh yeah, smart, great sense of humor. No, you're gonna have a great time. "
"Frasier: Dad, I can't believe you're doing this "
"Maureen: Frasier "
"Martin: Look, I was gonna tell you— "
"Frasier: Believe me, I did not put him up to this, though I think he's overselling me a little. I'm not the greatest guy in the world. Seattle, maybe. "
"Maureen: Am I missing something? "
"Frasier: Oh, I'm just joking. OK, Dad, thanks for warming her up for me. I can take over here. "
"Maureen: Martin? "
"Martin: Frasier... Maureen and I are here on a date. "
"Frasier: I know you might think this is one of those wildly embarrassing moments where I'm standing here with egg on my face. I assure you, I'm not as embarrassed as you might assume I would be embarrassed. I'm not uncomfortable, so please, don't you be uncomfortable either. "
"Maureen: Why don't I give you two a moment? "
"Frasier: Whatever "
"Frasier: You asked her out? "
"Martin: No, that's not the way it happened. "
"Frasier: There's no use lying to me. I am at the lowest point I could possibly be, so please just tell me the truth "
"Martin: Maureen asked me out. "
"Frasier: Going down "
"Martin: It happened the other night when you went to the bar to get drinks. You know, it just caught me off guard, I didn't know how to handle it. So, Niles said I should— "
"Frasier: Niles? Niles knows? "
"Martin: Look, I'm sorry. It was supposed to be a one-time thing, just to see if there was something there, and if there wasn't, then you didn't even need to know about it. "
"Frasier: Well, is there? 'Something there?' "
"Martin: Oh, yeah. "
"Frasier: Well... it's not as if we were standing side-by-side when she chose you. I was at the bar If you'd gone to get the drinks, things would have been different. "
"Martin: I don't think so. "
"Frasier: Dad, I'm drowning here. Please, throw me a line "
"Martin: Look, uh, I'm gonna go tell her this whole thing is a mistake— "
"Frasier: No, no, no, Dad I'll be OK, really. Well... the old dog's still got it in him, huh? "
"Martin: Yeah. But, really, how long can it last? I mean, she's got to come to her senses eventually— "
"Frasier: Oh no, Dad, Dad, don't sell yourself short. You've got a lot to offer. Well, I'd better head off to work. Goodnight, Dad. "
"Martin: Goodnight, thanks. "
"a: "
"Frasier: Damn "
"TO: "
"Roz: Uh-uh, OK, thanks. Frasier just came in the building, so everybody hide and be quiet. "
"Betty: Do you think he'll be surprised? "
"Roz: Considering his birthday was yesterday? Yeah, I do, Elizabeth. "
"Betty: Should we yell 'surprise' or 'happy birthday?' "
"Roz: We've done this like five hundred times. And every time it's pretty much the same. We yell, the person pretends to be surprised, and we stuff ourselves with cake. "
"Betty: I just wanted it to be perfect. "
"Roz: And that is what makes you so special to us. Now get under the console "
"Roz: Hi, Frasier How you doing? "
"Frasier: Oh, just wonderful. Forty-three is off to a rousing start. Remember that policewoman I was interested in? "
"Roz: Yeah? "
"Frasier: Well, she's dating my father "
"Roz: Your father? "
"Frasier: Mmm-hmm "
"Roz: Well, never mind that. I know just what will take your mind off of it. I've got something really funny in my booth. "
"Frasier: I spent the last hour wandering the streets, trying to take assessment of my life. Do you know how long it's been since I've slept with a woman? Seven months "
"Roz: Frasier— "
"Frasier: All right, nine months ' to each other. "
"Roz: I really don't think we should talk about that right now "
"Frasier: Oh sure, fine, you can't spare me five minutes to talk about my problems, when every day I drop what I'm doing to be your personal Wailing Wall. 'Frasier, he stopped calling me.' 'Frasier, he wants his key back.' 'Frasier, his girlfriend is having me followed' "
"Roz: I'm sorry. "
"Roz: So nine months, huh? "
"Frasier: Nine long, long, months. "
"Roz: Oh... "
"Frasier: You know who that woman was? "
"Roz: Who? "
"Frasier: Edna, from Accounting. "
"Roz: No... "
"Frasier: The next day, she dumped me I tell you, Roz, I'm starting to feel nostalgic for that summer in my twenties when I was impotent "
"Frasier: The only comfort I have now is knowing that my humiliation can't possibly get any worse "
"Staffers: SURPRISE "
"Frasier: Hi, Edna. "

"Daphne: Oh, Dr. Crane. "
"Niles: My God, after all our years together - all the good times, all the bad times - you can't loan me a meager four thousand dollars? You must appreciate how hard it is for me to approach you about this. I thought I meant more to you than this, but apparently I don't. And they call themselves 'the friendly bank' "
"Martin: What do you need to borrow money for? "
"Niles: I saw the most exquisite Biedermeier footstool. "
"Martin: For four thousand bucks? Niles, your mother and I didn't pay that much for our first house. "
"Niles: I know, dad. I lived there. "
"Martin: Well, I keep telling you, you don't have Maris's money to throw around anymore. You're going to have to start cutting back a little. "
"Niles: I have cut back. Last month I told my masseur I could only see him once a week. "
"Martin: Oh, I remember that scene in 'Grapes Of Wrath' when Ma Joad did that. "
"Daphne: You know, if you need to save a bit, you should do what I do and cut out coupons. "
"Niles: Coupons. Well, what a wonderful way to economize. Well, I could clip them and give them to my personal shopper. "
"Frasier: Oh, Niles, good morning. "
"Niles: Hey. "
"Frasier: Daphne, has Bebe Glazer called back yet? "
"Daphne: 'Fraid not. "
"Niles: You're still consorting with that barracuda? "
"Frasier: Well, a barracuda is what you want in an agent, Niles. It's just that the station's been sold, I was hoping she might have some scuttlebutt on the new owner. "
"Frasier: I must admit she's rather hard to get a hold of these days. "
"Niles: Oh, really? I thought one just drew a pentagram on the floor and chanted 'I summon thee' three times. "
"Frasier: Hello, Roz. "
"Roz: Hey. "
"Frasier: What have you got on the new owner? "
"Roz: Oh, plenty. "
"Frasier: Yeah? "
"Roz: His name is Wilford S. Boone, but he likes to be called 'Big Willy.' "
"Daphne: Well, there's a little snapshot of his psyche right there. "
"Roz: He's an eighty-five year-old Texan. Practically no formal education but he went from errand boy at a radio station to owning his own media empire worth six hundred million. "
"Niles: This is great, I don't even know what 'Renuzit' is, but it's twenty cents off and I want it. "
"Roz: You're clipping coupons? "
"Niles: I'm economizing. "
"Roz: Oh well it's about time, you spend money like a drunken sailor. "
"Niles: She said authoritatively. "
"Frasier: Excuse me, could we get back to the subject at hand, please? "
"Martin: What are you so antsy about? "
"Frasier: Dad, Wilford S. Boone- "
"Roz: Big Willy. "
"Frasier: Please, Roz, I just can't say that yet, alright? - Wilford S. Boone owns thirty radio stations across the country. If he likes you he's been known to syndicate your show nationwide. So, I'm trying to find out if we have anything in common - an angle, if you will. So what are his interests, Roz? "
"Roz: Well, it's all in there. He likes whittling, rodeos, the novels of Zane Grey... "
"Martin: Gee, Fras. It's like you two were separated at birth. "
"Roz: He also owns a 5,000 acre cattle ranch and the world's largest collection of antique six-shooters. "
"Frasier: Oh dear God, I'm sucking up to Yosemite Sam "
"Roz: I think if we really want to impress Big Willy we should think of some Western theme to do for the show today. "
"Frasier: Great idea, Roz. Why don't we just start the show off with a segment on how to get in touch with your inner young'un. "
"Gil: What a fascinating theory Do go on. "
"Frasier: What's going on? "
"Bulldog: Oh, this is great. I told Gil the new station owner is a Greek tycoon. "
"Frasier: He fell for that? "
"Bulldog: Hook, line, and souvlaki "
"show: "
"Gil: You can keep your overripe Camembert and malodorous Stilton, they can't compare with the salty insouciance of Greece's glorious Feta. It's not just for shepherds anymore This is Gil Chesterton saying Bon Appetite, or as we say in Athens, Kali Orexi "
"Frasier: Oh Gil, you've been had. The new station owner isn't Greek, he's from Texas. "
"Bulldog: You are so easy "
"Gil: Well, I hope you're happy I've just given four stars to a restaurant called 'A Taste Of Greece.' Which, trust me, is no misnomer. "
"Bulldog: Well that's what you deserve, trying to suck up to some senile old coot "
"Bulldog: Hell, he probably can't eat anything but strained peas and farina "
"Frasier: Uh, Mr Boone? "
"Boone: Yeah, that's right. "
"Frasier: Pleasure to see you. I'm Dr. Frasier Crane. This is Roz Doyle, Gil Chesterton and... "
"Bulldog: I'm Skippy the lunch boy. So, uh, that's two strained peas and a farina for the big guy. "
"Gil: Oh, uh, Skippy? Change my order I've got a sudden hankering for baby-back ribs and corn bread. "
"Boone: Oh, I've been looking for you Dr. Crane. I have a little problem and they told me you're just the fella who could fix it. Oh, I hope I'm not imposing. "
"Frasier: Oh, no, don't be silly, Mr. Boone. "
"Boone: Well, actually I prefer 'Big Willy.' "
"Frasier: Don't be silly, Big Willy. [Roz and Frasier keep in their laughter] "
"Boone: You see, I'm engaged to be married. "
"Frasier: Oh, congratulations. "
"Boone: Well, sweet young thing. Just nuts about me. Problem is, she smokes. "
"Frasier: Oh lord, that is a very bad habit. "
"Boone: Oh, it's a vile habit Would have destroyed my affection for her if, well she didn't possess certain... compensating gifts. Anyway, as a favour to me, could you help her? "
"Frasier: Well, I'll certainly try. Just keep in mind, though, addiction is fraught with many complex issues. Length of habit, motivation... "
"Boone: Forgive me, sometimes I don't express myself too clearly. When I say, 'could you help her,' what I meant to say was HELP HER "
"Frasier: Consider it done. "
"Boone: Much obliged. She'll be in touch. "
"Frasier: That's me, Dr. Frasier Crane, bimbo wrangler. "
"Roz: Frasier, stop it This is a golden opportunity You make this little tootsie quit smoking and we're halfway to syndication. "
"Bebe: Did someone just say the word 'syndication,' or do I just hear it every time I lay eyes on my favorite client? "
"Frasier: Oh, Bebe. "
"Bebe: Is something wrong, dear? "
"Frasier: Well, yes. "
"Roz: We just met Big Willy... "
"Frasier: Oh, he thinks I'm some sort of a magician. He wants me to play therapist to his little fianceé. No doubt some gold- digging piranha so devoid of scruples that she's willing to rob the coffin and just... "
"Frasier: Oh, dear God "
"Bebe: Isn't it wonderful? We met last month and it was love at first sight. "
"Roz: First sight of what - his bankbook and a cardiogram? Two minutes. "
"Bebe: I'm hurt that she can even joke about such a thing. I love that dear sweet old man with every fibre of my being. "
"Frasier: I'm sure you do. I'm afraid there won't even be a wedding if you can't get rid of that rotten habit, and he's just ordered me to see that you do "
"Bebe: God, you'd think a touch of emphysema were the end of the world "
"Boone: What's that in your hand, woman? "
"Bebe: Sorry, pudd'n. Bebe slipped. "
"Frasier: Just that all-important last puff. "
"Boone: Well, see that it is Well, Dr. Crane, I'm heading out of town for three days. When I get back on Sunday, I expect my little gal here to be smoke-free by then. "
"Frasier: In... three days? "
"Boone: Now, you do whatever it takes to help her, doc Drugs, straightjackets, electroshock... "
"Bebe: You see how he dotes on me. "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Excellent progress, Bebe You've really dived into the emotional void that is the route of your addiction. Your fear of abandonment, your fear that those you trust will suddenly turn their backs when you expect them to... Excuse me. "
"Bebe: My God, it all seems so clear now. You're a miracle worker. "
"Frasier: If I had a dime for every time... well... Niles "
"Niles: Hello Frasier, I noticed you were out of capers the other night, so I got you this. "
"Frasier: Thank you Niles, but why so many? "
"Niles: I just discovered a place called 'Price Buster's Warehouse.' You have to buy in bulk, but the savings are extraordinary and they have a huge selection. I found french fries and french doors in the same aisle. "
"Frasier: Well, the next time you go back be sure to buy me a thousand swordfish so I can use these up "
"Niles: You laugh, but I could do it like that. So, how goes the great smoke-out? "
"Bebe: Until today, I had no idea what a brilliant therapist your brother is. He has tunneled his way into the very depths of my psyche. "
"Niles: Well, let's hope he sent a canary down first. "
"Bebe: Well, I'll be running along. I'll see you at ten tomorrow. In the mean time, it's exercise, lots of fresh spring water and nicotine gum for cravings. "
"Frasier: That's my girl. "
"Niles: Oh, Bebe, you know I'm writing a paper on addiction and I'd love to ask you some questions - unless there's some reason you're eager to be off? "
"Bebe: Me? No. No, not at all. "
"Niles: Well, I just need to discuss a personal matter with Frasier first. "
"Bebe: Of course, I'll give you some privacy. It's time for my water anyway. "
"Frasier: Yes, Niles? "
"Niles: Let her out that door, she'll smoke half a pack before the elevator hits the lobby. "
"Frasier: How can you know that? You hardly spoke to her. "
"Niles: Well, obviously you didn't see the crazed, cunning glint in her eyes. "
"Frasier: She always looks like that, she's an agent. "
"Niles: I know about addiction. It's the exact same look Maris used to get during the cough syrup years. The only way to deal with it is to lock her up, take her money, and watch her like a hawk until it's out of her system. "
"Frasier: That means she would have to stay here for the weekend. "
"Daphne: Who's staying all weekend? "
"Niles: Bebe Glazer. "
"Martin: Here? "
"Daphne: What does she have to stay here for? "
"Frasier: She's trying to quit smoking. "
"Martin: Oh great, that means she'll be extra lovable. "
"Frasier: Not to worry dad, there is no reason she has to stay for the weekend. Bebe and I made a real breakthrough today. If you don't believe me, just come on into the kitchen and you'll see that I'm right. "
"Bebe: I'm sorry I can't stay and help you with your paper, Niles, wedding preperations and all. But I'll remember those helpful hints. It's exercise, gum, and lots of water. "
"Niles: Water should come in handy for putting out those pesky purse fires. "
"Frasier: All right Niles, secure the door Bebe, you are not going anywhere, you're staying for the weekend. Now give me that purse. "
"Bebe: All right. Let me remove one very precious momento. "
"Frasier: Very well. "
"Frasier: Oh, stop it "
"Time: 10"
":10) "
"Bebe: More "
"Daphne: What again? "
"Martin: That's her third serving. "
"Frasier: Now, now Dad, it's flattering to Daphne that Bebe finds her food so tasty. "
"Bebe: I'm orally fixated. I could eat a half-stunned wharf rat if you put some gravy on it "
"Daphne: I'll bear that in mind come breakfast time. "
"Frasier: No, please, please. Let's all try to remain supportive of Bebe. I think she's really doing rather well. "
"Niles: So, I hear your fiancee is well to do? "
"Bebe: Very. "
"Niles: Well, marrying money can have it's perils. Ten or fifteen years down the line, after you've adapted to a lifestyle now totally beyond your means, you can find yourself cast aside a hollow husk, penniless and crushed. "
"Frasier: Niles, Big Willy's eighty-five, he's on his third pacemaker. "
"Niles: Ah. Mazel tov "
"Martin: Just out of curiosity, has this guy ever seen you eat? "
"Bebe: After dinner is the time I need a cigarette most. As long as I don't stop eating, I'll be fine. "
"Frasier: Well, this is very good, Bebe. You're already identifying those moments that trigger your worst cravings. "
"Bebe: Yeah, yeah "
"Frasier: No, really. Perhaps it would help to know that you're not alone. Dad is an ex-smoker. Dad, can you tell us about those moments you crave a cigarette most? "
"Martin: Ah, when I had insomnia. I'd get up, pour a water glass full of Bourbon, light a cigarette - next thing you know, I couldn't keep my eyes open. Nothing relaxes you like a cigarette. Of course, gives you a hell of a headache in the morning. "
"Daphne: Well, I smoked for years but I never became addicted. To this day, I can buy a pack, have a cig or two, toss them in a drawer and not crave another for months. "
"Bebe: You know there's a word for people who can do that. What is it? Oh, yes - bitch "
"Niles: There's no need to be insulting just because you're wrestling with an unhealthy and disgusting habit. "
"Bebe: It isn't disgusting, it's wonderful "
"Frasier: Oh now, Bebe, tell me. What is so wonderful about smoking? "
"Bebe: Everything. I like the way a fresh firm pack feels in my hand. I like peeling away that little piece of cellophane and seeing it twinkle in the light. I like coaxing that first sweet cylinder out of its hiding place and bringing it slowly up to my lips. [Daphne comes back with a bowl; getting more "
"erotic:] Striking a match, watching it burst into a perfect little flame and knowing that soon that flame will be inside me. I love the first puff, pulling it into my lungs. Little fingers of smoking filling me, caressing me, feeling that warmth penetrate deeper and deeper, until I think I'm going to burst Then - whoosh - watching it flow out of me in a lovely, sinuous cloud, no two ever quite the same. "
"Daphne: More potatoes, anyone? "
"TO: "
"Bebe: You're up early, Miss Moon. "
"Daphne: Ever since your little speech about smoking, I haven't been able to think about anything else. Please, don't mention this to Dr. Crane. "
"Bebe: Silence has its price, dear. And I think we both know what that is. "
"Daphne: Forget it You can't make me give you one of these. "
"Bebe: Oh... can't I? "
"Daphne: You open up right now "
"Bebe: All right, missy, here's the drill You drop those cigarettes, I'll open the door, you kick 'em over to me, capisce? "
"Daphne: No "
"Bebe: Oh, is it cold outside? "
"Daphne: All right, you asked for it "
"Bebe: No No Please, I beg you. "
"Daphne: Oh, oh no. My fingers are getting weak. Oh, oh, I'm losing my grip. "
"Bebe: Stop, please I'll give you anything you want. I'll... I'll make you a star "
"Frasier: What the hell's going on out here? "
"Bebe: Daphne was smoking "
"Daphne: She made me "
"Frasier: Daphne, give me those. "
"Daphne: Oh, look at me I'm all damp and chilled to the bone. "
"Frasier: I'll get you a towel. My God, it's five-thirty in the morning Dad "
"Martin: I couldn't sleep. "
"Frasier: Have you people all lost your minds? Alright, now listen, get back to bed, every one of you "
"Martin: All right, all right... "
"Bebe: Thank god you came in when you did She was praying on my weakness. Who knows what I might have done, probably... THIS "
"Frasier: Oh, get her Stop that woman "
"Frasier: Bebe, you will not be allowed to smoke a cigarette in this house No, no, don't even think about it All right, just give me those "
"Frasier: All right now, that's it Back to bed "
"Frasier: Oh my God, you're insane, woman "
"Martin: That's it, no more house guests. "
"Bebe: Get off me, you brute "
"Frasier: Hand them over "
"Bebe: Never "
"Daphne: That'll be the neighbours Hello? Oh, hello One moment, please. It's Big Willy "
"Frasier: Big Willy, hello No, no, it's not too early, everybody's up Well, you know, there have been a few minor setbacks, but I'm keeping on top of her, yeah. Oh yeah, I know she'd love to say hi, hang on. "
"Bebe: Hello, pudd'n. I'm fine, and you? Oh, nothing's too much trouble for you daddy. Bye now "
"Frasier: Yes, sir? Oh, oh, really? No, no, I'm very flattered. Yes, of course, I'd love to, I'll talk to you this evening. Bye-bye. Thank you, Daphne. All right, now listen up He thinks I'm very gifted. "
"Bebe: Mmm. "
"Frasier: He thinks I'm wasting my talents in just one city My God, woman, he wants to take me national, don't you get it? Unless YOU ruin it for me "
"Bebe: Oh my God, sorry. Here, take 'em. [hands over packet; he lets her up] I don't know what came over me. "
"Frasier: Well, don't be too hard on yourself, Bebe. After all, addiction to Nicotine is a very, very difficult... hey, wait a minute. This pack is half-empty "
"Frasier: For God's sake... I don't care anymore. You know, I can't help you, nobody can. You want to ruin it for both of us? Here, go ahead, knock yourself out. I only wish I could be there when it happens. "
"Bebe: When what happens? "
"Frasier: When you see that newspaper "
"headline: 'Big Willy Boone, Millionaire, Dead.' "
"Frasier: Oh, how I wish I could be there when you watch the funeral on the news. Watch the casket being slipped into the ground. Only, you won't be watching that. No, no, you'll be watching... the widow Boone. Tiffany, perhaps. Oh no, better yet, 'Kelli' - with an 'I' "
"Bebe: Stop it "
"Frasier: You'll picture her wearing YOUR jewels, sailing in YOUR yachts, sleeping with YOUR gigolos - but, oh, you won't be sad, no, no, no Because you'll have your cigarette. "
"Frasier: Yeah Clutched in your nicotine-stained teeth, smoke whirling about your once-pretty, now creased, leathery, smoke-ravaged... "
"Bebe: Enough God [hands over cigarettes and comes in] You are one hell of a therapist. "
"TO: "
"Martin: Hey, you back from the wedding already? "
"Roz: No. "
"Frasier: There was no wedding. "
"Roz: No wedding, no syndication deal... "
"Martin: What's she doing here? "
"Roz: No money, no fame... "
"Frasier: Well, you might say things hit a bit of a snag. "
"Roz: No beach house, no pool boys... "
"Frasier: Oh will you get a grip, Roz? "
"Martin: Well, what went wrong? "
"Frasier: Well, they were halfway down the aisle - Big Willy beaming proudly, Bebe radiant, supporting Big Willy on her arm - when suddenly he clutched his heart, and his head slumped against Bebe's shoulder. Of course we were all concerned at first, but then suddenly it seemed like he was all right because they kept moving on down the aisle. But if you looked carefully, you could see Bebe's little biceps bulging through her wedding gown, and I swear I noticed daylight between Big Willy's dress boots and the carpet. Well, once they got up to the minister the jig was pretty well up, despite Bebe's valiant attempts to animate his features by twisting the loose skin at the back of his neck. You know, I've never seen a woman more crushed. "
"Martin: Well, if I were you I'd get her away from that balcony rail. The doorman gets ticked if you even through a piece of gum over the side. "
"Frasier: Bebe, dear? Please, come on in. That's a girl. All right, let me have a look at you. Come on, here we are. "
"Frasier: Well, I don't really blame you, dear. You know, Roz and I are both upset too. You know, look at it this "
"way: at least you're no worse off than you were before. "
"Bebe: You don't know the things I did for that man - the depraved, Western-themed appetites I satisfied "
"Roz: He was eighty-five, how bad could it have been? "
"Bebe: Ever worn a saddle? "
"Roz: Do I have to answer that? "
"Frasier: Well, you know, Bebe, there are other Big Willys out there, better ones Richer, older... Impotent "
"Bebe: Oh dear, you always know what to say. I know what hell I put you through over this. I insist that you take this, as a small token of my gratitude. "
"Frasier: Oh Bebe, really... Look, Roz It's a gold Rolex Oh my goodness... "
"Frasier: Bebe... where did you get this? "
"Bebe: Just don't wear it to the funeral. "

"Frasier: Go ahead, Tom. I'm listening. "
"Tom: Hi, Dr. Crane. Uh, it's about my girlfriend. My problem is, I don't know if I love her for herself Or because things are so great between us physically. "
"Frasier: Well, how long have you two been together? "
"Tom: Six years. "
"Frasier: And the sex is still that good? "
"Tom: Oh man, Dr. Crane, every morning, night, three times a day on weekends. But I'm not sure we have much else in common. "
"Frasier: Well, common interests are of course the foundation of... three times, you say? "
"Tom: Is that abnormal? "
"Frasier: Well, uh, no, no, it's not abnormal. It's not fair, but it's not abnormal. "
"Frasier: Um, but you know, perhaps you share more things than you think you do actually. I'll tell you what, try "
"this: why don't you pick up a catalogue from a local university, go through it with her and see if there are any courses you'd like to take together? "
"Tom: That's a good idea Thanks, Doc. Have a great weekend. "
"Frasier: Well, I'd wish you the same but it hardly seems necessary. "
"Frasier: Well, that's it for today, Seattle. This is Dr. Frasier Crane, wishing you all good mental health. [goes off the air] "
"Roz: Niles called from the airport; he wants you to call him back. He sounded frantic "
"Frasier: I'll call him from the car. He's flying to a conference in Switzerland; I promised to talk him through it. "
"Roz: Surely he's flown before? "
"Frasier: Well, not coach "
"Frasier: Roz, is this the dress you're wearing to the wedding? "
"Roz: I have to, I'm a bridesmaid. "
"Frasier: Is there a reason it has to be so, so...? "
"Roz: Hideous? It's supposed to be, so that way, the bride, By comparison, will glow [holding the dress up to her distastefully] Next to this baby, she'll light up like a bug zapper. You know, of all my friends in Wisconsin, this girl was the last one I thought would beat me to the altar. "
"Frasier: Not the Dairy State's comeliest chunk of cheddar? "
"Roz: Let's just say she works in her father's ice cream parlour and she eats her mistakes. The groom's family makes cones. "
"Frasier: Oh, well, we don't need Freud for that, do we? "
"Roz: The whole thing is just so depressing. Lately everyone I know is settling down, getting married, having children. What am I doing wrong? "
"Frasier: Well, do you want me to answer as a friend, or a therapist? "
"Roz: As a friend "
"Frasier: See a therapist. "
"Roz: Frasier "
"Frasier: Well, Roz, I think your whole problem stems from some unresolved issues that cause you to choose the men you date. Always flashy and superficial, offering no prospect of a lasting relationship. "
"Roz: Why would I do that? "
"Frasier: Maybe fear of commitment, fear of being hurt. But maybe it's time you started looking at different kinds of men. You know, men who are more settled, a little less flash and more substance. "
"Roz: You're probably right, Frasier. Hey, if I were smart, I'd go out with the next guy I see I'm not the least bit attracted to. "
"Bulldog: Roth, Roth, I juth bit my tongue. Can you kith it and make it better? "
"Roz: The next one after him. "
"Bulldog: Oh, Doc, Doc. Here's my video camera. "
"Frasier: Oh, thank you, Bulldog. "
"Bulldog: What do you need it for? "
"Frasier: Well, I'm going to record my father. I'm going to have his life on tape so Frederick can enjoy it in years to come. "
"Roz: What a good idea "
"Bulldog: Whoa That's the ugliest thing I ever saw "
"Roz: I'm going to a wedding. "
"Bulldog: Oh, I love weddings. Never been to a wedding where I didn't bag at least one bridesmaid. And the uglier the dress, the quicker they want to get out of them. This one would hit the floor before the rice "
"Roz: I've got to get going. Can you believe I actually have to be seen in public in this thing? "
"Frasier: Well, Roz, it's only for a few hours. After that you can donate it to the Salvation Army... and one day make some Irish drag queen very happy. "
"Niles: What's the point of going to Switzerland without spending a day on the slopes? So I ducked out of the conference and who should I run into, but Maris? She'd just flown in for her yearly goat placenta treatments "
"Frasier: Good Lord, is it placenta treatment time again already? "
"Niles: We had a set-to on the slopes. She ran, I tried to follow her tracks in the snow, but alas, she made none. "
"Niles: Oh, dear... "
"Frasier: What is it? What's the matter? "
"Niles: I just spotted someone. It's my least favorite patient. The man's a compulsive womaniser. He goes through so many women, he calls them all by the same odious nickname, 'Sunshine,' to avoid slip-ups. "
"Frasier: Oh, God. "
"Niles: Frasier, what do you do when you don't like a patient? "
"Frasier: Well, it's a tricky subject, isn't it? How long have you been seeing him? "
"Niles: Six months. We've made no progress whatsover. Sometimes I feel he comes in not so much for help as to brag. He claims to have been with, at last count, one hundred and fifty women "
"Frasier: Oh puh-leease A hundred and fifty "
"Niles: As if anything over, say... seven weren't absurd. "
"Frasier: Well, I would say eleven, but I get your point. "
"Niles: Oh, now serving one hundred and fifty-one. "
"Frasier: Good God He's here to see Roz? "
"Niles: Yes, well, no doubt they met when Sealy Posturepedic named them Man and Woman of the Year. "
"Frasier: Niles, you don't understand. She-she's been very vulnerable lately. "
"Niles: Well, I hope you'll forgive me if I don't stick around. I'd like to leave before she makes introductions. "
"Frasier: I've got to warn her "
"Niles: Warn her how? What I just told you was in strict confidence, therapist to therapist. You can't go repeating it "
"Frasier: But-but- "
"Niles: No "
"Frasier: Oh... of course, of course, you're right, I won't. But that is the last man that Roz should be with "
"Niles: Well, don't worry. Knowing Roz, he won't be. "
"Roz: Hey, Frasier "
"Frasier: Oh, Roz "
"Roz: I'd like to introduce you to someone. This is Ben Collins. "
"Frasier: Frasier Crane, pleasure. "
"Ben: Likewise. "
"Roz: Is it all right if we join you? "
"Frasier: Oh, why not?? "
"Ben: I'll grab our coffees. "
"Roz: He is the greatest guy You know, when I first met him, I thought, 'He's not my type.' Then I remembered what you said. And I'm so glad you gave me that advice, Frasier, because without it, I would never have given him a second look. "
"Frasier: Well, Roz, let's not rule out that all-important third look. "
"Roz: Would you stop worrying about me, Frasier? This one's different. I can tell he really cares about me. "
"Ben: Here you go, Sunshine "
"TO: "
"Martin: Why can't you be like other dogs? Why can't you bring home bones or animals you kill? "
"Martin: Give me those Relax, I'm just going to put them with the roses you picked yesterday. "
"Frasier: Oh hey, Dad Fresh from your walk? I think now is as good a time as any to crank up the ol' camcorder. "
"Martin: Nah, maybe later. "
"Frasier: Oh Dad, you've been saying 'no' for weeks now "
"Martin: Well, gee, some people would take that for a hint "
"Frasier: All you have to do is just sit here and talk about your life. "
"Martin: Life's got nothing to do with it This is about me dying and you having something to look at after I'm dead. The whole thing gives me the creeps "
"Frasier: I can't believe you're refusing to record your history, the story that only you, Martin Crane, can tell, because it gives you the creeps "
"Martin: OK then, I'll tell you the real truth. [mockingly holds the limp tulips to the back of his head] My Indian heritage forbids it. I'm afraid your magic box will rob me of my spirit. "
"Frasier: I don't know why you're being so negative about this. It's not really for when you're dead. It's for when you've lost your mind. "
"Roz: Hey, Frasier. "
"Frasier: Oh hello, Roz Why, after waiting for forty-five minutes, did I assume you'd forgotten our appointment? "
"Roz: Sorry, but uh... I was on my way out, when Ben called. "
"Frasier: Oh yes... Ben. "
"Roz: Oh, what's with you? Every time I bring him up, you make that face. I'm getting the sense that you don't like him that much. "
"Frasier: It's just that I know something about Ben... "
"Roz: What? "
"Frasier: He's a little old for you. "
"Roz: He's thirty-six "
"Frasier: Exactly my point When you were a freshman, he was a senior. That never works out I'm getting my briefcase "
"Roz: I'll go get a Coke. "
"Roz: Oh, hi, Daphne "
"Daphne: Hello, Roz. How are you? "
"Roz: OK... can I ask you something? Does Frasier seem weird to you-? "
"Daphne: Oh God, yes. "
"Roz: I haven't finished my question yet. "
"Daphne: Yes, well, when you know the answer, it's hard not to hit the buzzer. "
"Roz: Well, this is strange. I mean, for the first time in years, I'm in a really solid relationship, and instead of being happy for me, Frasier seems upset. "
"Daphne: Oh, that is odd. Unless... "
"Roz: Unless what? "
"Daphne: Well... Dr. Crane is jealous of Ben because he wants you for himself. "
"Roz: Huh? Ohhh, no, no, no "
"Daphne: Yes, what else could it be? "
"Roz: Fra-Frasier? What, you really think so? [pushes Daphne playfully] Daphne, no No way No, he doesn't - Frasier is the one who told me to find myself a new boyfriend. Someone who is settled, someone more nurturing, someone with substance over flash. "
"Daphne: They could put that on Dr. Crane's tombstone. "
"Roz: Oh, come on No way "
"Daphne: Yes Wait, there's something else. "
"Roz: What? "
"Daphne: I probably shouldn't tell you this. But earlier this morning, Dr. Crane was on the phone with his brother and he said that your relationship with Ben was driving him crazy, [Roz's jaw drops] and that he was dying to tell you but he can't. "
"Roz: Oh my God, did you hear him say that? "
"Daphne: I certainly did "
"Roz: Oh, this is too weird, this is too weird What am I going to say? Maybe I won't say anything. Maybe he'll just see how happy I am with Ben. "
"Frasier: Oh, Ben, Ben, Ben My God, Roz, would you just drop it with Ben for a minute and pay some attention to me? "
"Roz: Oh-kaay "
"Frasier: Morning, Roz "
"Roz: Hi, Frasier "
"Frasier: Hey, you look lovely, that colour's very flattering "
"Roz: Thanks. "
"Frasier: You know, I think this calls for a hug "
"Roz: Oh, I don't look that good. "
"Frasier: No, no, no, no, Roz. Look My God, the ratings are in, and we did better in our timeslot this week than ever before Congratulations, partner "
"Frasier: Why don't we have dinner tonight, celebrate? "
"Roz: That sounds so fun... but I kinda have plans. "
"Frasier: I should have known. Another time, perhaps. "
"Roz: Yeah sure, that sounds great. "
"Bulldog: Yo, Doc. When are you going to return my video camera? I got a hot date tonight and I want to record certain events for posterity, if you know what I mean. "
"Frasier: Uh... tomorrow, Bulldog. Well, maybe tonight you could just have a police sketch artist crouch on your balcony. "
"Roz: So Mom, let me ask you something. How long did you know Dad before you told him you loved him? Mom? Mom? Mom, you've been divorced fifteen years Let it go "
"Roz: Listen, Ben is coming over to dinner tonight, and I think I'm going to tell him I love him. "
"Roz: I gotta work, bye "
"Frasier: Oh I'm, I'm sorry, Roz. I should have knocked. "
"Roz: It's OK, it's OK, it's OK "
"Frasier: I couldn't help overhearing the last part of your conversation there. You think you're not rushing things a little bit with Ben? Are you really that serious? "
"Roz: Yes, I am. "
"Frasier: But you know, there are a lot of men in the world. "
"Roz: And lots of women, too "
"Frasier: Well, that's more of a personal preference but I... "
"Roz: I meant for you Look, Frasier, what I'm trying to say is I know you have a problem with me and Ben, but we're happy together. "
"Frasier: Well, it's just that you've only been going out for a month "
"Roz: Well, sometimes, that's all it takes. Fifteen seconds Listen Frasier, I'd like to think that there's some small part of you that is happy for me. After all, it WAS your advice that got me this far "
"Frasier: Of course I'm happy for you. "
"Roz: Thanks. "
"Frasier: Me and my stupid advice... [notices the 'On-Air' light] will be with you for the next three hours, Seattle "
"TO: "
"Martin: I'm not doing it, it's morbid. "
"Niles: It's not morbid. And besides, if you don't do it, the only footage we'll have of you in the family archives is you pretending your stomach was a face that summer at the lake. "
"Martin: Alright Niles, if it'll shut you up, I'll do it. "
"Niles: Thanks, Dad We'll make this quick and easy. [he adjusts the camcorder, then looks at Martin] Is that what you're wearing? "
"Martin: Forget it. "
"Niles: No, no no, all right. Here we go, here we go. [starts recording] OK... "
"camera: "
"Martin: My name's Martin Crane. When I made this tape, I was sixty- four years old. But now... I'm DEAD "
"Martin: Trapped in a box, underground... Pretty scary, huh? "
"Niles: Dad, surely you must have some message you want to leave for the Cranes of the twenty-first century? "
"Martin: Alright, alright, I do. Remember to always work hard, and that family comes first. And... I have a million bucks in unmarked bills that I took off a drug dealer that I have stashed in my old army foot locker. The combination is left fifteen, right thirty-two, le-le... "
"Niles: Future "
"generations: see what I had to put up with? "
"Frasier: Hello. "
"Martin: Hello. "
"Niles: I suppose this means we're finished? "
"Martin: Well, unless you want future generations to see me go to the can "
"Frasier: Niles, actually I'm glad you're here. I have to talk to you about Roz. "
"Niles: Oh, no, no, no. I've breached my ethics once already. "
"Frasier: Niles, please, I've gotten desperate "
"Niles: No, no, no "
"Frasier: Niles, she plans to tell him that she loves him tonight From what you told me about Ben's patterns, that will be the end of it and Roz will be shattered. God, there has got to be some loophole in this confidentiality rule that will allow me to warn her and still preserve your ethics. Niles Help me look through these textbooks "
"Niles: No, I'll have no part in this "
"Frasier: Please, Niles Think of Roz "
"Niles: I'm thinking of my license "
"Frasier: Well then, think of what Freud said 'We are never so helplessly unhappy as when we lose love.' "
"Niles: Oh, all right But that was dirty pool, using a Freud quotation. "
"Frasier: I'm sorry, I'm sorry. "
"Niles: It's the Crane boys' kryptonite. "
"Frasier: I know, I know. Thank you. "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Say, here's a possibility. According to this, it says we can warn her if he means to do her bodily harm. Does he? "
"Niles: No. "
"Frasier: Damn "
"Niles: It would be so much easier if Roz were mentally incompetent. "
"Frasier: Go on... "
"Niles: Well, then there'd be some justification for protecting her. Is she irrational? "
"Frasier: She did attack a vending machine once, when a Twinkie came out of the Oreo chute. "
"Niles: Borderline, borderline. Does she ever act delusional? "
"Frasier: Well, she often claims that she is responsible for the success of our show. "
"Niles: Building, building. Does she display below-average intelligence? "
"Frasier: She once ordered a bottle of white Zinfandel "
"Niles: Jackpot Go to her, she's a threat to herself "
"Frasier: It's amazing they even let the woman drive "
"TO: "
"Roz: Who is it? "
"Frasier: It's Frasier "
"open: she looks a mess. She's clad in the awful lime- "
"Frasier: Oh my God What happened? "
"Roz: He dumped me, Frasier "
"Frasier: Oh, oh, honey I - come here. Oh God... "
"Roz: Everything was going great Until I said 'I love you, Ben.' Then he got this look on his face, like he'd taken a wrong turn in a really bad neighbourhood He didn't even touch the champagne. "
"Frasier: Oh I'm... I'm sorry, Roz. Here. "
"Roz: Thank you. "
"Frasier: When you... when you professed your love for him, uh... were you dressed like that? "
"Roz: No After he left, I went in to change, and I saw all these old bridesmaid dresses hanging in the closet. And that's when it hit me. That's what I am, a bridesmaid I might as well wear the uniform "
"Frasier: Oh Roz, no, no Now, now, come on "
"Roz: Yes "
"Frasier: Come on Now look, look, you know, I find that whenever I'm low, it always lifts my spirits when I just spruce up a bit. It wouldn't hurt to run a brush through your hair... or through your teeth. "
"Roz: Oh God I must look awful "
"Frasier: No, no, not at all. "
"Roz: You're a big fat liar. But you were right about Ben, and I just didn't see it. What made you come over here anyway? "
"Frasier: Well, actually, I was coming over here to take one last stab at convincing you that Ben was the wrong man for you. You deserve someone better, Roz. "
"Roz: Oh, yeah, I'm a real catch Hell... "
"Frasier: Oh, now, things really aren't all as dark as they seem. You know, you're a-a beautiful, intelligent, desirable... "
"Frasier: Why don't you let me just take a stab at that, will you? I can't imagine any man not thinking himself the luckiest in the world to be with you. "
"Roz: You really do... think that, don't you? "
"Frasier: Yes, and I'm surprised you even had to ask me that. "
"Roz: I guess I didn't. I've known that you've had these romantic feelings toward me, for a while. "
"Frasier: What? "
"Roz: Oh come on Don't deny it. Those hints about finding someone with substance over style, the way you hated Ben. And then Daphne told me she overheard you telling Niles that you couldn't stop thinking about me and wanted to tell me the truth "
"Frasier: Daphne told you that? "
"Roz: Yeah - don't be mad at her. "
"Frasier: No, no, I'm not. It's just that when she said that... "
"Roz: No it's OK, Frasier. I'm glad she told me. The only thing keeping me from completely falling apart right now is knowing that someone like you could be interested in me. "
"Frasier: Well, then... there's no point in denying it, is there? "
"Roz: You know, maybe the idea of you and me isn't so crazy. You are the kind of man I should be with Smart, gentle... Ow I said gentle "
"Frasier: Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Roz. Uh, you know, it's just that there are so many... "
"Roz: I know, I know. Workplace romances always fail. "
"Frasier: Exactly my point "
"Roz: And I'm on the rebound. I've got to give myself time to heal. "
"Frasier: Yes yes, lots of time. "
"Roz: On the other hand, you are the one who always says the best relationships start with friendship. "
"Frasier: Well, I do say that, yes. It's true, but... "
"Roz: And we're friends, aren't we? "
"Frasier: We're very good friends. "
"Roz: Right now we are both free. "
"Frasier: Oh well, in my case, painfully free. "
"Roz: You know, maybe if we both went into it with our eyes open...? "
"Roz: Oh no, what am I saying? My relationship with you is probably the healthiest one I've ever had with a man I don't want to screw that up. "
"Frasier: Now that you mention it, my relationship with you is probably the best one I've ever had with a woman Not that it's been much of a horse race, but... "
"Roz: To friendship? "
"Frasier: Here's hoping the next time you tell a man you love him, he says it back. "
"Roz: Well, let's see. I love you, Frasier. "
"Frasier: I love you too, Roz. You gonna be alright? "
"Roz: Yeah. "
"Frasier: Well, I'd better run. "
"Roz: Yeah, my saying 'I love you' seems to have that effect on men. "
"Frasier: No, no, I'll-I'll stay if you like "
"Roz: No, no. Don't you worry about me. I will not be alone. I will be sliding into a hot tub with my good friends, Ben & Jerry. "
"Frasier: See you tomorrow, Roz. "
"Roz: See you, Frasier. "

"Martin: You got something on your mind? "
"Daphne: It's Joe. Tonight's our six-month anniversary, but we can't celebrate until next week because he's flying to Las Vegas with his buddies. "
"Martin: Oh, Vegas, huh? Great Well, tell him not to miss the show at the Diamond "
"Lounge: a Topless History of the World If they've still got the same Bathsheeba he's in for a real treat "
"Daphne: Oh yes, that's just where I want Joe spending our anniversary, some smutty show in Vegas "
"Martin: No, it's very tasteful and historically accurate. Except at the end, where Eleanor Roosevelt and Eva Braun settle World War Two by wrestling in pudding. "
"Daphne: Hello, Dr. Crane. "
"Niles: Daphne. "
"Frasier: Oh, Niles. To what do we owe this pleasure? "
"Niles: To an unscrupulous art dealer who's trying to rob me blind. Last night, I was at a gallery opening, and— "
"Frasier: Niles, is this going to be a long story? "
"Niles: Moderately. "
"Frasier: Walk-and-talk. "
"Niles: Anyway, I was at this opening, in conversation, when I made a rather emphatic point about pointillism, when I lost the grip on my canapé and found that it became airborne Well, the next thing I know I'm being confronted by an irate gallery owner who's demanding I reimburse him for the damage to one of his paintings How he could notice a fleck of foie gras on a Jackson Pollock is beyond me. "
"Niles: He's getting an estimate, and just to protect myself, I seem to recall you knowing a trustworthy art restorer? "
"Frasier: Oh yes, I do, actually. Saved my life last year when Eddie licked my Liechtenstein I'll get you his card. "
"Niles: Oh, thank you. "
"Niles: You free for lunch today? "
"Frasier: Oh, sadly, no. The radio station is subjecting my program to something they call a 'focus group' this afternoon. Dinner, perhaps? "
"Niles: Oh, perfect. And what exactly is a focus group? "
"Frasier: Well, they actually drag a pack of people off the street and make them listen to my program, and then dutifully record their opinions about it. "
"Niles: How demeaning "
"Frasier: Oh, absolutely. Can you imagine Sigmund Freud being dragged into a roomful of Viennese laymen to hear remarks like, 'hate that Oedipal thing, but, oh, love the penis envy' I mean, really The worst thing is that they may change my show in deference to the opinion of Joe Six-Pack "
"Martin: You're worrying too much. I was on a focus group once. "
"Frasier: That sound you hear is a nail being hammered into my coffin. "
"Martin: They were trying out a new frozen snack. It was a meatball with the cheese injected right in the middle. "
"Frasier: Just as nature intended. "
"Niles: Dr. Niles Crane. Ah. So, you have the estimate? What? Four thousand dollars, to remove a miniscule gobbet of duck liver? I could do the same thing with a Q-tip and some club seltzer Oh well, you may very well say 'pay up or else,' but I have something to say to you— "
"Woman: Yeah, well at least I wasn't fooling around with the babysitter "
"Man: Shut up "
"Woman: No, you shut up "
"Niles: Oh please, I have enough aggravation without having to listen to a stupid talk show I swear, the only life forms lower than the people who appear on those shows are the ones who watch them "
"Daphne: Like me? "
"Niles: What? Oh no, I didn't realize— "
"Daphne: No, no, no, that's quite all right. Although I do find it interesting that I get criticized for listening to people's problems, when all you do is get rich from it. "
"Niles: Surely, Daphne, even you can see the difference between cheap sensationalism and the practice of psychiatry. "
"Daphne: Oh, 'even me?' As in, 'even feeble-minded Daphne?' Well, I'll tell you what I can tell the difference "
"between: a true gentleman and a condescending prig "
"Niles: I... am NOT "
"Daphne: He said priggishly. "
"Niles: Forgive me if I'm not as down to earth as you and your tattooed, muu-muu wearing brethren "
"Daphne: You pompous twit "
"Niles: Couch zombie "
"Daphne: Snob "
"Niles: Brat "
"Daphne: Oh, shut up "
"Niles: No, YOU shut up "
"Martin: I'm glad we turned off the TV. "
"Daphne: Oh, Dr. Crane, I'm so sorry I'm just so upset at Joe I didn't mean a word of it "
"Niles: Daphne, I apologize— "
"Daphne: Oh no, it was my fault— "
"Niles: I called you a couch zombie— "
"Daphne: No, please— "
"Niles: Friends? "
"Daphne: Oh, of course. "
"Frasier: Niles, what was that all about? "
"Niles: I'm not sure. But, oh, mama, it was glorious Blood- pounding, sarcastic zingers flying "
"Frasier: Are you saying you that enjoyed fighting with Daphne? "
"Niles: Every exhilarating moment It was pure, unbridled passion I think I still have some of her spittle on my forehead Oh, why did Dad ever tell us not to fight with girls? It's wonderful The friction between us— "
"Frasier: Niles, is this going to be a long description? "
"Niles: Very "
"Frasier: Walk-and-talk. "
"Frasier: By showering a reluctant girlfriend with gifts, Billy, you're applying a band-aid to a gaping wound. My advice is to find someone who will return your worthy affection, or your wallet, as well as your bed, will be empty. I see we're out of time. Thank you for listening. This is Dr. Frasier Crane, wishing you all good mental health. "
"Moderator: OK, let's talk about Dr. Crane's show. Oh, I know you've been eyeing this two-way mirror, but the other people behind there are data consultants, so please speak freely. There's no one involved with the show whose feelings could be hurt. "
"Roz: If anybody says anything bad about me, I'll kill myself "
"Frasier: Now, Roz, relax. We do a perfectly good show. We're not going to change it one iota. Only a fool would listen to the opinion of every Tom, Dick, and Harry. "
"Room: Man 1"
": I liked everything about it. "
"Room: "
"Frasier: On the other hand, it's good to keep an open mind. "
"Room: Man 2"
": I like that Roz. I think her voice is really sexy, especially that throaty laugh of hers. "
"Room: "
"Roz: Wow, that's nice. I didn't know I had a throaty laugh. "
"Collector: You do. I've noticed it too. "
"Roz: Really? Oh, you. "
"Room: Man 2"
": The stuff he says really seems to make a lot of sense. Woman 1"
": Yeah, it's funny. I mean, he takes his callers seriously, but he can kid around with them too. Woman 2"
": Yeah, I listen to a lot of radio, and I think this is a great show. "
"Room: "
"Frasier: Well, I just don't know how much more of this I can listen to "
"Moderator: Manu, I notice you've been quiet. Uh, do you have something to say? "
"Manu: Me? No. "
"Moderator: We'd like to hear your opinion of the program. "
"Manu: Well, it... I don't know. Something about... I don't like it. "
"Room: "
"Frasier: Well, who is this cheeky nonconformist? "
"Collector: Well, let's see, his name is Manu Habib, married, no children, owns his own newsstand. "
"Roz: Wow, that is so weird, to hear someone's whole life summed up like that. 'Roz Doyle, Radio Producer, single.' "
"Room: "
"Moderator: Well, getting back to your thoughts, Manu, you said there was something about the program you didn't like. Can you be more specific. "
"Manu: I don't like him. "
"Moderator: Why? "
"Manu: I don't know. I just don't like him. Man 2"
": Oh, I do. I'm gonna start listening to him all the time. Woman 1"
": It's a great show. "
"Room: "
"Roz: My God, Frasier, this is a love-fest I can't believe we were even worried about it. "
"Frasier: 'I just don't like him.' Hmm... "
"Moderator: Well, looks like our coffee's here. Why don't we take a quick break, OK? "
"in: "
"Bulldog: Hey, sports fans How's it going in here? "
"Frasier: Bulldog, I thought they were testing your show across the hall? "
"Bulldog: Oh, yeah, they are. But after ten minutes it's just the same-old, same-old. Guys love me, chicks pretend not to. Whoa, your group's even uglier than mine "
"Roz: Would you knock it off? These people happen to like us. "
"Bulldog: Oh, will you guys lighten up? You got to get in the spirit of things. "
"Bulldog: Hey, hey This is great, I live for a moment like this. "
"Bulldog: That's right, that's right, go for it, right there, right there. "
"Frasier: Bulldog— "
"Bulldog: As long as you're in there you might as well go after the Huevos Rancheros you had for breakfast "
"Frasier: Oh, stop it "
"Bulldog: Hey, ten bucks says he eats what he finds. "
"Frasier: Oh, that's disgusting "
"Bulldog: Come on, come on, come on, come on— [the man puts the finger back in his mouth] BINGO Do I know these people or what? "
"TO: "
"Martin: Hi, Niles. "
"Niles: Hey, Dad. May I assume from your dress windbreaker that you'll be joining us for dinner? "
"Martin: Yep, but I'm making a pitch that we eat at the Timber Mill. I got a coupon from there that expires tomorrow. "
"Niles: Oh. If I dine there tonight, so may I. "
"Daphne: Hello, Dr. Crane. "
"Niles: Oh, there's the British bobcat "
"Martin: Now, look, she's still a little bit over the edge about this Joe thing. So you better watch your step or you're gonna have a repeat of this morning. "
"Niles: We wouldn't want that, would we? Chips, Daphne? Was that wise? "
"Daphne: What do you mean? "
"Niles: You know what they say, 'many chips make for chunky hips.' Waddle, waddle, waddle "
"Martin: Have you lost your mind? "
"Daphne: Oh, no, no, I'm glad if I put on a few pounds. Now maybe Joe will stop nagging me to plump up "
"Martin: Hey, Fras, how was the focus group? "
"Frasier: Fine, I guess. "
"Martin: Oh, well, you said yourself they didn't mean anything. "
"Frasier: Yes, well, it's one thing to say that. It's another to sit there being personally attacked One man actually said, 'I just don't like him.' "
"Niles: Only one? "
"Daphne: I'm sure someone must have said something nice. "
"Frasier: Well, all the other eleven had nothing but high praise. "
"Martin: Eleven out of twelve liked you? You should be thrilled F..DR didn't have that kind of approval rating. "
"Daphne: Yes, or Churchill for that matter. "
"Niles: Churchill—that cigar-chomping gin blossom with a face attached "
"Daphne: You're right about that. There's a kiss hello to put you off your tea. "
"Frasier: I wish I was able to talk to this man and ask him what it is about me that he doesn't like. But, I-I can't, you see, he was told that his comments would be kept confidential. "
"Martin: Just forget it. Come on, let's go out to dinner. I'm buying. "
"Frasier: Well, what is it he doesn't like about me? My voice, my manner, do I intimidate him? "
"Martin: I don't know What is it about you? Everybody has to love you Just like when you were in that play in high school. You get standing ovations every night, all your friends say you're great, you got one lousy review in the school paper and you sulked for a week. "
"Frasier: Well, you know, Dad, I'd like to think I've matured a bit since then. But, you know, you would have sulked too, if you'd read in the paper, 'Mr. Crane's attempts to gyrate his hips as Conrad, the teen idol in 'Bye-Bye, Birdie,' made this reviewer say, 'Bye-bye, breakfast'' "
"Niles: That review was a mash note compared to my first draft. "
"Daphne: I know just what you're going through. I once won a dance competition hands down, but instead of celebrating I spent the whole night fretting over my one bad score. Silly-head "
"Niles: Idiot. "
"Niles: Oh, I've stepped in it now "
"Daphne: Listen here, Dr. Crane— "
"Niles: Yeah, Daphne? "
"Frasier: All right now, Daphne, just a moment Just try to remember what you're like when you're arguing with Joe. Consider Niles's situation. He's separated. You can't imagine the emotional see-saw he's on. Not to mention the fact that he may be unaware that he's acting like a complete jackass "
"Daphne: Of course, you're right. I'm sorry, I should be more sensitive. From now on, nothing you say can make me cross with you. "
"Niles: I suppose I had that coming. Though I think 'jackass' was a tad over the line. "
"Frasier: Well, just consider it payback for the headline, 'Crane's 'Birdie' Lays An Egg' "
"Martin: All right, now, Fras, you got to let it go. You know, no matter who you are, no matter what you do, you can't please everyone. "
"Frasier: I suppose my negative baggage is just a pound or two over the weight limit. "
"Martin: O.K., good, come on, let's go have dinner. "
"Frasier: This is good This is healthy I'm letting go "
"TO: "
"Frasier: There he is. The man who... doesn't like me. "
"Martin: I knew we should have taken two cars. "
"Martin: What are we doing here? "
"Frasier: I'm sorry, Dad. It's just that 'I just don't like him,' it's not specific enough. Why doesn't he like me? "
"Martin: What difference does it make? "
"Frasier: Well, if his point was valid, I would do something about it. If it's not, well, then I could dismiss it. "
"Martin: Fine, go talk to him. "
"Frasier: I can't. He's not supposed to know I was part of the focus group. You, Dad You could go talk to him for me. "
"Martin: Oh, for crying out loud— "
"Niles: Look, if we're going to be here for a while, could we at least lock the doors? "
"Martin: Relax, Niles, the neighborhood's O.K. "
"Niles: The docks are two blocks from here "
"Martin: So's the Ritz-Carleton. "
"Niles: Exactly We're caught halfway between heaven and hell. "
"Frasier: All I want is more information. Dad, please? Please go talk to him for me? "
"Martin: All right, if I get an answer for you, can we go to dinner? "
"Frasier: O.K., fine. Oh, but wait, wait, wait Now you can't just walk up there and ask him. He'll know that I sent you. Got to find some artful way of introducing the subject. "
"Niles: Can we at least hide Dad's handicapped sign? It sends a clear signal that we're incapable of fighting back "
"Martin: So do your suspenders. "
"Frasier: All right, I've got it, I've got it. You're a business man in town from Chicago. No, no, it's too obvious. Uh, from Cleveland. No would ever pretend to be from Cleveland. "
"Martin: Fine, then we eat. "
"Frasier: Wait, wait, we're not through yet Yes, you've had a bad sales month, and you're a little depressed. You happen to see an add for my show on the side of a bus, and you were wondering if I'm as intelligent as I look. "
"Martin: What? "
"Frasier: Oh, just word it your own way. Are we clear on this now? "
"Martin: All right, I got it. Businessman, Cleveland, depressed, then eat "
"Frasier: Yes, Dad, eat Honestly, sometimes you can get so obsessed about things "
"Martin: Oh, God, it's raining "
"Martin: Hi, I'm Marty Crane. My son's Dr. Frasier Crane. He's across the street in that BMW. No, don't look "
"Manu: Oh, my God. He was behind the mirror. "
"Martin: Look, don't worry about it. He's not mad at you. He just want to know why you don't like him. "
"Manu: But I do like him. "
"Martin: No, you don't. "
"Manu: Oh, yes, I do "
"Martin: No, he heard what you said. "
"Manu: I can't do this. I don't like to say bad things about people, and you are his father— "
"Martin: No, you'd be doing me a favor Just answer this one question, and we'll all get out of your life forever. "
"Manu: All right. I-I don't know your son well. But, uh, I guess I find him, uh, just a little bit... annoying. "
"Martin: Yeah? "
"Manu: Annoying. "
"Martin: O.K. You did good. Thanks. "
"Manu: Please tell your son I'm sorry that he annoys me so much. "
"Martin: Will do. "
"Niles: Not yet... not yet... not yet. OK, unlock And lock "
"Martin: Mission accomplished. "
"Frasier: Good. Did he believe my story? "
"Martin: Oh, yeah, I had him going pretty good. That Cleveland thing really sold it. Well, we better go eat now, huh? Before he sees us again. "
"Frasier: Right. So, uh, Dad, what doesn't he like about me? "
"Martin: He said you annoy him. "
"Frasier: Yes, how so? "
"Martin: Well, I didn't ask him. "
"Frasier: What do you mean you didn't ask him? "
"Martin: Oh, geez "
"Frasier: I'm sorry, Dad, but I have no idea what 'he's annoying' means "
"Martin: Well, it's clear enough to me "
"Frasier: I'm just going to have to do this myself "
"Martin: Here. "
"Frasier: Thank you. "
"Martin: Who're you calling? "
"Niles: No one. I just pressed 911, and I'm keeping my finger poised over the Send button in case there's trouble with those hooligans. "
"Martin: Oh, the UPS men or the little girls playing in the puddle? "
"newsstand: "
"Manu: Hello. "
"Frasier: Hello. "
"Manu: I can help you? "
"Frasier: Uh, yes, yes, you were recently speaking with a salesman from Cleveland. "
"Manu: I don't think so. "
"Frasier: It was just five minutes ago. He left you and went over to that car waiting right over there. You see? "
"Manu: Oh, God, no. You're him, it's you. "
"Frasier: Yes, yes, it is. I'm so sorry, I really don't mean to bother you but I would like to talk to you for a minute. "
"Manu: I like your show. "
"Frasier: Oh, no. "
"Manu: I like your show, and I like you. "
"Frasier: That man was my father— "
"Manu: I like your father "
"Frasier: Oh, that's very nice of you, but you see, you told him that, uh, you find me annoying. Yes, yes, you did, and that's all right. I don't mind constructive criticism. It's just that I wish you could be a bit more specific. What exactly is it about me that you find so annoying? "
"Manu: You're not annoying. "
"Frasier: Yes, I am Would I be here if I wasn't? "
"Manu: Well, I have enjoyed talking to you very much, but it's time for my break. "
"Frasier: Oh, no, no, please "
"Frasier: I'm so sorry. "
"Manu: I am a sticky mess. "
"Frasier: Let me help you with that. "
"Manu: No, no, no, no, it's fine, good. "
"Frasier: Manu? "
"Manu: Drive safe. "
"Frasier: Oh, dear God I'm so sorry Are you all right? Let me look at it, let me look at it— "
"Manu: No, no "
"Frasier: Look, I am a doctor. "
"Manu: No, no, I just go to the restaurant to put ice on it. "
"Frasier: Right, you know, I'll hold down the fort here Glad to be of help "
"Niles: He's crushed the gentleman's hand, and now he appears to be commandeering his newsstand. "
"Martin: Uh-huh. "
"Frasier: Oh, good lord. Smoking in the worst places "
"Amanda: How much for the paper? "
"Frasier: Ah, yes, uh, well, that would be oh, fifty cents. Thank you so much. There we are. "
"Amanda: Scuse me, are you Dr. Crane from the radio? "
"Frasier: Why, yes, I am. "
"Amanda: Oh, I just never miss your show I love you I guess you get tired of hearing that. "
"Frasier: Oh, occupational hazard. "
"Amanda: Oh, would you mind—? "
"Frasier: Oh, I wouldn't mind at all. "
"Amanda: To Amanda. "
"Frasier: Amanda, it's a pleasure. "
"Amanda: What are you doing here, anyway? "
"Frasier: Oh, oh, well you see, let me explain, you see. [steps out of the newsstand] The, uh, radio station conducted a little audio survey today, and although the response was favorable from eleven out of twelve of the participants— "
"Amanda: Is that smoking? "
"Frasier: Well, some people might consider it smoking, but you see, for me— "
"Amanda: FIRE "
"Niles: Oh, my God. Frasier set his newsstand on fire. "
"Martin: Mmm-hmm. "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Uh, may I? Look, I know there's nothing I can say right now that would make you feel any better, but rest assured, I will be financially responsible for everything. "
"Manu: All this because you had to know why I do not like you. "
"Frasier: Well, you were kind of vague. "
"Manu: You want to know why? I'll tell you why. I think you are a smarty-pants. I was too polite to say that before. But then you spied on me, you stalked me, you badgered me, you poured Yoo-Hoo down my Dockers, you crunched my hand, and then, as if all that was not enough, you burned down my newsstand, my livelihood, a gift to me from my beloved uncle, may he rest in peace "
"Frasier: Was that so hard? "

"Frasier: This is Dr. Frasier Crane, wishing you all good mental health. "
"Roz: Happy anniversary "
"Frasier: Oh, Roz Oh, this is so much fun, Roz I got you one too "
"Roz: Oh, thank you O.K., you first. I mean, it's nothing really, it's not expensive or anything, you probably won't even like it, I'm not good with gifts— "
"Frasier: Look, don't oversell it, Roz. It's a tape. 'The Dr. Frasier Crane "
"Show: Show #1, May 21st, 1993.' "
"Roz: It's our first broadcast. "
"Frasier: Oh, Roz I can't wait to listen to it Did you ever think I'd stay on the air this long? "
"Roz: Oh, hell no. 'To Roz, who believed in me from the start.' "
"Frasier: Yes, it's from Hallmark's 'Irony' section. "
"Roz: Oh, Frasier, they're beautiful Earrings Thank you, thank you "
"Frasier: You deserve them. Working side by side for three years, one can't help but become close friends. And they're blue To match your... lips when they're cold "
"Daphne: Oh, Mum, it's not that I don't want to come home. I'd love a visit It's just that I can't He won't let me. "
"Daphne: Oh, you have no idea what Dr. Crane is like. Why, he's an absolute beast — unpleasant to be around, a real tyrant "
"Daphne: Oh It's just my mum. I'm trying to get out of a visit home. "
"Frasier: Oh, I understand. All right. "
"Daphne: No, I'm not exaggerating He treats me like a bloody slave "
"Frasier: Daphne Where's my dressing gown? "
"Daphne: Not to mention how cheap he is "
"Frasier: That better not be a long-distance call "
"Daphne: Yeah, yeah. He does sound a lot like Aunt Lillian. "
"Daphne: I got to run, Mum. Love you, bye. I'm sorry, you must think I'm a terrible daughter. "
"Frasier: No, not at all. I think you're a terrible liar, Daphne, but a perfectly run-of-the-mill daughter. "
"Daphne: It's just that I only get one vacation a year, and I want to go somewhere fun, like Acapulco. "
"Frasier: Well, that makes sense. "
"Daphne: And going home is just so flipping boring. It's always the same. There's a wonderful reunion at the airport, and we share all our news on the way home in the car. And by the time I've dropped off my suitcase, we've exhausted all conversation, and that's when I realize I've got a whole week left with nothing to look forward to but Dad telling the story of how he once shared a cigar with Winston Churchill during the blackouts — he thinks "
"Frasier: Well, it sounds like an easy decision, Daphne — [raises his glass] Hasta luego. "
"Daphne: Oh, Dr. Crane, why is it so easy to love our families, yet so hard to like them? "
"Frasier: Well, Daphne, that is one of those questions that make life so rich... and psychiatrists richer. "
"Daphne: Yeah, well, maybe I'll just go call a travel agent, see which guilt trip is more expensive. "
"Frasier: Good afternoon, Seattle. My name is Dr. Frasier Crane. If you can feel, I can heal. "
"Frasier: Fasten your seat belt, Eddie. It's going to be a bumpy ride. "
"TO: "
":57 PM "
"Frasier: Hello. You're on the air with Dr. Frasier Crane. 'Put your head in my hands.' "
"Frasier: 'Little owlet in the glen, I am ashamed of you, You are ungrammatical in speaking as you do, You should say, 'to whom, to whom,' not 'to who, to who.' Your little friend, Miss Katydid, may be green, 'tis true, But you never heard her say—' Who the hell are you? "
"Roz: I'm Roz Doyle, your new producer. "
"Frasier: What? Producer? "
"Roz: Dr. Crane, I presume? "
"Frasier: Yes, yes, but, uh, where's Dave? "
"Roz: Uh, he got another assignment. "
"Frasier: But I was comfortable with Dave. "
"Roz: Look, Dr. Crane, I know you've been thrown a curve, but everything's gonna be fine. "
"Frasier: But I did a mock show with Dave. I did mock-call-in's, mock commercials, mock news bulletins "
"Roz: Look, I got a bulletin for "
"you: Dave's out, I'm in, and stop saying 'mock.' "
"Frasier: All right, look, Miss Doyle, I'm sure you're quite capable, but Dave has fifteen years of experience. I'd really prefer that he do it. "
"Roz: Well, that would make two of us then, wouldn't it? "
"Frasier: I really think I should call management and ask for Dave, it's not really fair to Dave or to me. "
"Roz: Dr. Crane, Dave dumped you. "
"Frasier: Why? We were here until 2 A.M. this morning, as I explained to Dave in meticulous detail my philosophy of optimal mental health "
"Roz: It's a mystery, all right. O.K., look, I'm going to screen a few calls, and— "
"Frasier: No No, no, as I explained to Dave before, there will be no call-screening. You see, I want my show to be fresh and spontaneous, and call screening squelches all of that. "
"Roz: And the mystery of Dave's departure deepens. OK, you're on in five seconds, I'll give you a cue. "
"Frasier: Good afternoon, Seattle. My name is Dr. Frasier Crane. 'If you can feel, I can heal.' "
"Frasier: Let's see who's on line one Hello, this is Dr. Frasier Crane. 'You're on the couch.' "
"Angela: No, I'm not. "
"Frasier: Well, I meant on the metaphorical couch. "
"Angela: I'm in a beanbag chair, O.K.? "
"Frasier: Uh, moving on then, um, how can I help you? "
"Angela: It's about my husband... Look, I-I just can't do this, it's really too embarrassing for me. "
"Frasier: No, no, please, please, dear friend, you must - I'm really here to help you. Please, go ahead. "
"Angela: ...I've tried, and I've tried, and I just don't know what to do about this "
"Frasier: Well, you know, often in these cases, it helps if you restate your problem. But this time, try boiling it down to one succinct sentence. Now, how would you do that? "
"Angela: My husband is dead "
"Frasier: Well, perhaps we should go back to the wordy version. Uh, we'll be right back after these important messages. "
"Roz: Of course I could do a gardening show. If I can grow plants in my dorm room closet, I must know a thing or two about horticulture— "
"Frasier: Are you trying to get transferred? "
"Roz: Bye Look, Dr. Crane, I got to be honest with you here. It's just that I-I think psychiatry is, just, uh, sort of - kind of... bull "
"Frasier: Oh, well, this is a match made in heaven then, isn't it? "
"Roz: Oh, don't be offended. "
"Frasier: 'Don't be offended.' Why should I be offended? In the last week, I've uprooted myself from my home of fifteen years, moved all the way across the country away from everything I care about, and plunged myself into a frightening new career The first few nerve-wracking moments, I walk in here and find my producer lobbying to get herself transferred to another show Abe Lincoln had a brighter future when he picked up his tickets at the box office "
":13 PM "
"Roz: O.K., you got to make the caller get to the point, and then for God's sake, so should you. "
"Frasier: Duly noted. "
"Roz: O.K. Number twenty-four... You know what, you're starting to glaze. We can go through the rest of this tomorrow. See you, Frasier. "
"Frasier: Bye, Roz. "
"Niles: Oh, excuse me. "
"Roz: Well, excuse you. "
"Frasier: Oh, Niles "
"Niles: Oh, Frasier What a serendipitous event. How did you discover my favorite coffee bar? "
"Frasier: Well, the radio station's right across the street. I did my first show today. "
"Niles: Yes, you did, didn't you? Well... good to see you, have a nice day "
"Frasier: Niles, aren't you going to join me? "
"Niles: Oh, well, I would, but I have a routine. I come in every day, order coffee and spend some quality time... with myself, you understand. "
"Frasier: Niles, I've seen you once in the last two years. "
"Niles: Oh, that is your point. Well... very well, in the spirit of blood being thicker than water, why don't we? "
"Frasier: I remember your fourth birthday party. Grandmother took us to the park to ride the carousel, and made all those little children wait while you wiped off your painted pony. "
"Niles: I was wearing Bermuda shorts and that saddle was slick with toddler sweat. "
"Frasier: Well, uh... oh, uh, thanks again for dinner the other night with Maris. You two seem very happy. "
"Niles: Oh yes, it's love. Like the Arctic Puffin, we've mated for life. Honestly, I can't imagine even looking at another woman. "
"Daphne: Excuse me, sir, have you finished with that sugar? "
"Frasier: Oh, yes. "
"Waiter: You ready to order? "
"Niles: Uh, yes. Double decaf non-fat latte, mmm... medium foam, dusted with just the faintest whisper of cinnamon. "
"Frasier: I'll have a black coffee. "
"Niles: You'll have to forgive my brother. He just came in on the noon stage. "
"Frasier: I hope I never see the day when I am so frightfully pretentious that a good-old cup of American coffee isn't good enough for me. "
"Niles: So, how'd your visit with Dad go? "
"Frasier: I haven't been to see him yet. "
"Niles: Really? You've been in town a whole week. "
"Frasier: Well, I've been very busy, what with settling into the new apartment, unpacking... "
"Niles: Frasier, you're obviously making excuses. I'm going over tonight for my weekly visit, why don't you come along? "
"Frasier: Geez, I know I should, Niles. But I'm really in such a vulnerable state right now. The last thing I need is Seattle's reigning sourpuss taking potshots at me. "
"Niles: Is that what you're worried about? "
"Frasier: Yes "
"Niles: Well, you have been out of touch. Our father's a changed man. Ever since he was shot, he's softened, with a whole new zest for life "
"Frasier: Niles, I visited him in the hospital. He made his roommate cry, and the man was in a coma. "
"Niles: Dad was still in shock. The change came after. As a psychiatrist surely you've seen this? A patient has a brush with death and rediscovers his love of life. Ah, the laughs we've had when I'm over there. I sometimes wonder if that bullet didn't crease his funny bone. "
"Niles: Oh... thank you. Can you believe the incompetence of that man? I very clearly asked for a whisper of cinnamon, he's given me a full-throated shout There are countries in this world where they would lop off his sprinkling hand "
"Frasier: You know, I'd forgotten what a weird little person you are. "
"TO: "
"Niles: Dad is going to be positively giddy when he sees that he's got the both of us tonight. "
"Martin: Who is it? "
"Niles: Niles, and a special guest "
"Martin: Oh, jeez... all right, hold your horses. "
"Niles: How does he come up with those? [Martin opens the door] Look, Dad, it's Frasier "
"Martin: Well, I can see that. That punk didn't shoot out my eyeball. "
"Niles: He sees the humor in everything. "
"Martin: Frasier, come on in. "
"Frasier: Thanks, Dad. So, big game? "
"Martin: Nah, they're losing again. Pitcher's a bum. "
"Niles: He's a bum, he's an absolute hobo Isn't that right, Skipper? "
"Martin: Niles, are you drunk? "
"Niles: Don't be ridiculous Seeing the three of us back together again in the same room — who needs alcohol for that? "
"Martin: I do. "
"Frasier: I do. "
"Martin: I'll get you a beer. "
"Frasier: Thanks, Dad. "
"Frasier: You filthy liar You said he'd changed "
"Niles: Well, it got you here, didn't it? I've been dealing with him all by myself ever since Mom died. Now it's your turn, so welcome home, prodigal son "
"Martin: You guys want some pork rinds? "
"Niles: And that's as close as you're going to get to a fatted calf. "
"Frasier: No, thanks, Dad. "
"Niles: Oh, will you stop staring at me? "
"Martin: Here you go. "
"Niles: Ah, well, I understand completely, Frasier. Dad, Frasier was just saying that he'd like to spend some quality time with you alone, so I'm just going to slip out. "
"Martin: All right, suit yourself. "
"Niles: All right... oh, you haven't met Eddie. [picks up Eddie and turns him around to face Frasier] Eddie? Frasier is the firstborn. The torch has been passed. "
"Frasier: So... "
"Martin: How was your flight? "
"Frasier: Oh, actually, I drove. "
"Martin: You take the I-Ninety? "
"Frasier: Uh, Eighty. "
"Martin: Should have taken Ninety, it would have got you here faster. "
"Frasier: Darn. So, Dad, did you listen to my show today? "
"Martin: No, I missed it. Sorry. "
"Frasier: That's all right. "
"Martin: How'd it go? "
"Frasier: Well, uh, kind of rocky. Spent a good part of the day puzzling over the proper signature line to use to introduce myself. "
"Martin: Well, I'm sure you'll come up with something. "
"Frasier: Well, you know, I'm looking for something that's familiar but not a cliché, you know, something that's memorable but not too gimmicky... You know, it doesn't really matter if it's got something to—Dad, please, I'm trying to have a conversation, it's hard with the TV on. "
"Martin: Well, I just want to get the score, O.K.? "
"Frasier: I'm trying to describe to you my dilemna with that phrase— "
"Martin: All right, fine, I'm listening. Are you happy? I'm listening. "
"Frasier: That's it 'I'm listening' That's fabulous Have you got a pencil somewhere? "
"Martin: Yeah, there's one in the kitchen on the table. "
"Frasier: 'I'm listening.' Dad - oh, I love that "
"Martin: Uh, look, I hate to cut this short, but I told some guys I'd meet 'em down at Duke's. "
"Frasier: You're leaving? "
"Martin: Yeah. Whenever you're ready, I'll walk you out. "
"Frasier: Dad, I haven't seen you in two years, I stopped by and you're leaving in ten minutes? "
"Martin: Oh, why don't we stop kidding ourselves? You don't really want to be here, and we don't really have anything to talk about. "
"Frasier: At least I'm making the effort. "
"Martin: Oh, yeah — it's an effort to talk to me, huh? Well, I guess that's why you only bother coming home once a year at Christmas. Oh no, wait Sorry, I take that back. Last year you went to Arugalah, wherever the hell that is. "
"Frasier: Dad, you know you're painting an awfully bleak picture here. Ever since I moved to Boston, I've come home at least three or four times a year. It's just lately things got a little hectic, and I haven't been able to come home as often. "
"Martin: Yeah... I noticed how busy you got after your mother died. "
"Martin: But, what the hell, I didn't go visit you in Boston either, did I? So, uh, why don't we just drop this? "
"Frasier: No. The point is that we're here now, together. I don't want this night to end before we've at least tried to have one real conversation. Will you at least try, Dad? Will you just sit down with me for a while and let's try, please? "
"Frasier: So, uh, you know, I'd forgotten how much it really does rain here. "
"Martin: You get used to it. "
"Frasier: Makes things green. "
"Martin: Yeah... where would the old earth be without rain? "
"TO: "
"Frasier: My darling, I would have thought that old fascination would wear off by now. "
"Niles: Well, hello, there "
"Martin: Hey "
"Frasier: Oh, hey, guys. "
"Niles: Frasier, Dad tells me you've been on the air three years today, so we'd like to take you out for a celebratory dinner. "
"Frasier: Well, thank you. Dad, how did you know? "
"Martin: Well, I heard that woman who called in. "
"Frasier: You listened to my show? "
"Martin: Well, I sort of... I feel asleep during the Mariners' game... but when I woke up, you were on. "
"Frasier: And you didn't turn me off. "
"Martin: I did not I listened to you for ten minutes before I finally dozed off again. "
"Frasier: Faint praise, and yet it thunders in my ears "
"Daphne: Hello, Dr. Crane. "
"Martin: Hey, Daphne, we're going out to dinner. You want to join us? "
"Daphne: Oh, thanks, but no. I promised myself that tonight I'd decide what I'm doing on my vacation — either home to the family or to sunny Acapulco. I may just squeeze into my bikini and let my hips make the decision. "
"Niles: Of course, it would be more memorable if we celebrated at home, just for a— "
"Frasier: Let's go, let's go "
"Daphne: Have a lovely time "
"Frasier: Oh, fellas, hold the elevator for me. "
"Niles: All right. "
"Frasier: Daphne? "
"Frasier: I was just thinking about our discussion earlier this afternoon, and I've decided to give you an extra week off. That way you can go to Manchester, and Acapulco. "
"Daphne: Oh, that's so sweet You really must think I should go home. "
"Frasier: Well, I've just realized that being part of a family is really worth the effort. And very often the effort... means you'll need a week in Acapulco, so... "
"Daphne: Thank you, Dr. Crane. "
"Frasier: You're welcome. "
"Daphne: I guess if I try a little harder, it won't be so bad. "
"Frasier: Well, that's a good way of thinking. You know, things can get better. "
"Martin: Hey, let's go I got acid burning a hole in my stomach "
"Frasier: Still... would you mind leaving those brochures of Acapulco out for me? "

"Frasier: Niles, what are you doing? "
"Niles: This fruit-nut muffin contains a number of things I don't care for. Currants, a husk of something... Away, wrinkly thing. "
"Frasier: You know, if you and Maris ever reconcile, I'm gonna miss these tranquil mornings - I reading my newspaper, you tweezing your muffin "
"Martin: Hey, boys. I got a letter from one of my old army pals, Bud Farrell. The whole platoon's getting together next weekend on Rattlesnake Ridge. "
"Frasier: Oh, good for you. Speaking of old chums, Daphne, a Clive called for you a little earlier. "
"Daphne: Clive? "
"Frasier: Mmm-hmm. "
"Daphne: Did he sound British? "
"Frasier: No, he was one of those fiery Mexican Clives He said he'd call back. "
"Daphne: I bet he will "
"Martin: Oh, boy I can't wait to see the old gang "
"Niles: Oh Dad, you're not thinking of driving all the way to Rattlesnake Ridge? It's five hours away, you know how your hip stiffens up. "
"Martin: No problem, they said I can bring a guest So, who's the lucky one? "
"Frasier: Well, by my count, two of us get to be lucky "
"Martin: Come on, they're great guys - Stinky, Wolfman, Boom-Boom, Jim. Of course his name's not really Jim, we call him that because he likes to drink Jim Beam. Just like we call Hank 'Bud,' because he drinks Budweiser. Come on, you'd love these guys "
"Niles: We're sherry drinkers, Dad. Think about it Anyway, I have a conference that weekend. "
"Daphne: And I have my friend Megan's birthday party. "
"Martin: Fras? "
"Frasier: Oh, please let that be Megan needing a clown for her party "
"Daphne: Hello? Oh, Clive Yes, it has been a long time, hasn't it? Oh, I am sorry, I have dinner plans tonight. Well, maybe just a drink then. Say, 6"
":30? Me too. Bye. Oh, hell "
"Niles: So who is this Clive? "
"Frasier: An ex-boyfriend? "
"Daphne: Worse Ex-fiancé. "
"Niles: You were engaged? "
"Daphne: For years We were mad for each other. He was very sweet and had the most gorgeous eyes you ever saw "
"Niles: But-? "
"Daphne: Oh yes, that too I just couldn't see a future with him. I mean, the man was a total layabout. No ambition, no drive He couldn't hold a job. All he wanted to do was tinker about with his car. His fingers were always black from the motor oil. "
"Niles: What a brutish habit If God intended for me to work on my Mercedes, he wouldn't have given me Horst. "
"Daphne: I had to break it off But I had to bring him down easily, so I said if we were still free in five years, we could try again And here he is, right on schedule Well, what do I say to him? "
"Frasier: Well, be honest, tell him what you feel. "
"Daphne: And break the poor thing's heart all over again "
"Frasier: No, it's the best way to avoid unnecessary anguish. Case in "
"point: Dad, I do not have plans for next weekend, but I don't intend to spend it with Budweiser and Boilermaker and their liver-damaged friend, Seltzer "
"Martin: Well, that's fine. There'll be other reunions. "
"Frasier: See? No evasions, no inconvenient conferences, just simple honesty "
"Martin: But I don't suppose Jim'll make it next time. Says here he just had his third bypass. But I'll see him this June. "
"Frasier: Off to work "
"Martin: Unless I go first "
"Frasier: All right, I'll drive you to your stupid reunion "
"Martin: Thanks, son. "
"Martin: I guess I'll leave it a couple of days before telling him about Stinky needing a ride. "
"Frasier: And in closing, this goes out to Keith, the narcoleptic I spoke to a bit earlier. I'd be glad to resume when you feel a bit more alert, but in the meantime I suggest you reconsider applying for that air traffic control position. This is Dr. Frasier Crane, KACL, 780 AM. "
"Gil: Brilliant show, Frasier. Chock full of pithy insight. "
"Frasier: What do you want? "
"Gil: A favour. Bonnie Weems, the Auto Lady, just asked me to another one of her wretched dinner parties. Well, I was planning on saying that you and I have ballet tickets, so do back me up. "
"Frasier: Well, I'm sorry, I can't "
"Gil: But you've got to. Have you any idea how vile her food is? The local raccoons have posted warning signs on her trash bin "
"Frasier: Well, you see, she already invited me, and I told her I promised my father I'd drive him to his army reunion at Rattlesnake Ridge. "
"Gil: Oh, very clever. Well, I'd use it myself, but I killed my father off to escape her Labour Day clambake. "
"Frasier: Er, Roz, listen, I'm going to the opera tonight. You didn't happen to remember to bring my... "
"Roz: Oh, your opera glasses I'm so sorry, they completely slipped my mind. "
"Frasier: I wouldn't really mind, if you hadn't borrowed them to ogle that bodybuilder that moved in across the street. "
"Roz: Hey, just once or twice. It's not like I copied his name off his mailbox, so I could look up his number and call him while he was in the shower, so I could watch him cross the room naked to answer the phone in front of the picture window. That would be wrong. "
"Frasier: Look, I want them back. I refuse to squint through Pagliacci while you're trying to watch The Magic Flute "
"TO: "
"Daphne: Dr. Crane, I need your opinion on this outfit. I wanted something that said 'no romantic signals whatsoever.' "
"Frasier: Well, short of a cactus corsage, I think you've captured it. You know, Daphne, it's been five years. It's an awfully long time to carry a torch. Maybe he just wants to say hello. "
"Daphne: Oh, I certainly hope so. The thought of having to reject the poor thing again is more than I can bear. "
"Daphne: Oh dear, it's him. Anything between my teeth? "
"Frasier: No. "
"Daphne: Is there any spinach in the fridge? "
"Frasier: Just answer the door "
"Daphne: Oh, Dr. Crane, I was afraid you were Clive "
"Niles: Oh, Clive. Is that tonight? Oh, well don't I feel silly bringing over this 1000-piece jigsaw puzzle. "
"Frasier: I'm sure Daphne doesn't want us horning in on her reunion. We're going to dinner "
"Niles: Well, can't we order in? I've already assembled one kitten and two yarn balls "
"Frasier: I'm getting my jacket "
"Frasier: Niles, for God's sake, will you give them some privacy? "
"Clive: Hello. "
"Daphne: Hello. "
"Clive: Look at you, you look wonderful. "
"Daphne: Oh Go on. "
"Clive: I mean it. Very pretty and warm. So... "
"Daphne: So... "
"Clive: Oh my God I've got a spot of axle grease on your sweater. "
"Daphne: Oh, it's all right, really. It's just a ratty old thing. Please, come in. Same old Clive, I see. "
"Clive: I suppose so. "
"Daphne: So, what brings you to Seattle? "
"Clive: My undying love for you. Oh, damn I meant to lead up to that, sorry. "
"Daphne: No, it's all right. Just a bit... "
"Clive: Abrupt. No 'how are you, nice place you have here' - by the way, it is lovely. Is that the, uh, Space Needle? [goes to the window] "
"Daphne: Clive... "
"Clive: Super. Anyway, I remember what you told me five years ago. I thought my feelings might change, five years is a long time. But... "
"Daphne: Clive... "
"Clive: Let me finish My feelings for you haven't changed. I think about you every day, every night, and there comes a time in a man's life when he's got to sum up the courage to look at a woman straight in the eye and say... "
"Niles: Cheese Nips? I'm sorry, is this a bad moment? "
"Clive: Well, actually... "
"Daphne: No, no, not at all. This is my very dear old friend, Clive Roddy. Clive, I'd like you to meet Dr. Niles Crane... my husband. "
"Clive: Your husband? "
"Daphne: Yes, six months next week. "
"Clive: Well, don't I feel a bit... Congratulations, you're a very lucky man. "
"Time: 9"
":24) "
"Clive: Six months? Well, you two are practically newlyweds. "
"Daphne: Yes, we're still at that honeymoon stage. It's sickening, really. "
"Niles: Revolting Positively stomach turning "
"Clive: I should be going. "
"Niles: No I mean, we are so enjoying having you here. "
"Daphne: I did promise you a drink. "
"Clive: Oh. Well, I suppose I could stay for a bit. "
"Daphne: Oh Darling, would you give me a hand in the kitchen, please? "
"Niles: Certainly, my angel. "
"Daphne: Dr. Crane, I'm so sorry. It seemed the kindest way to let him down. I didn't mean to put you in an awkward position. [opens fridge and bends over to get something from the bottom shelf] "
"Niles: When it comes to you, no position is... [turns round, coming face to face with her backside] too awkward. "
"Frasier: Oh hello, you must be Clive. "
"Clive: Yeah, and you are? "
"Frasier: Dr. Frasier Crane. "
"Clive: Oh, Niles's brother. "
"Frasier: Yes. You met Niles? "
"Clive: Just now. Though I used to know his wife quite well. "
"Frasier: Really, you know his wife? "
"Clive: She's one of a kind, that one. "
"Frasier: Isn't she? "
"Clive: Certainly can light up a room. "
"Frasier: Oh yes, usually by leaving it "
"Niles: Frasier "
"Daphne: Clive I see you've met my husband's brother. "
"Clive: Yes. I'm not intruding on some family occasion, am I? "
"Daphne: Oh, no Frasier lives here. I mean, temporarily. He's… "
"Niles: Had a spat with his wife... Maris. "
"Clive: Sorry to hear that. "
"Frasier: Yes, me too. You know, Daphne, I'm parched, could you show me again where we keep the wine? "
"Daphne: Of course. Could you spare me a minute? "
"Niles: Oh, oh, oh, oh Wait, you have to pay the love toll. Too much, here's the change. [kisses her back] "
"Niles: Can you stay for dinner? "
"Frasier: I told you to be honest But would you listen? No Now instead you subject us to this ridiculous charade. "
"Daphne: Play along, please. I swear, one drink and he's out the door. "
"Niles: He's staying for dinner. "
"Frasier: What? "
"Daphne: Well, how did that happen? "
"Niles: He just sort of invited himself. Pretty damn cheeky if you ask me. "
"Daphne: Oh, dear God "
"Niles: Obviously he still has hopes of winning you back. We must keep these signs of affection as realistic as possible. "
"Frasier: Psst "
"Daphne: Oh, what will I serve? Do we still have that lasagna? "
"Frasier: Daphne, you don't expect me to endure an entire evening of this nonsense "
"Daphne: Just do this for me. And anything you want, name it. Anything, it's yours. "
"Frasier: Anything? "
"Daphne: Except Rattlesnake Ridge "
"Frasier: Oh, Clive "
"Clive: Yes? "
"Daphne: All right, I'll take him "
"Frasier: Lasagna all right for dinner? "
"Clive: Super. "
"Daphne: I'm warning you, one thing goes wrong and the whole deal's off. "
"Frasier: Nothing can go wrong. We just have to stick to our stories and avoid any complications. "
"Martin: Oh, I see we've got company "
"Niles: Dad "
"Frasier: Dad "
"Daphne: Dad "
"Daphne: Clive, I'd like you to meet my new husband's father. "
"Frasier: Or, as we sometimes say in this country, Father-in-law. "
"Clive: I'm Clive Roddy. "
"Martin: Yeah, Marty Crane. Somebody tell me... "
"Niles: Oh Daphne, we've been so remiss. We haven't given Clive the tour. "
"Daphne: Oh yes, quite right This is the living room. "
"Niles: No, I think he'll be more interested in the master bathroom. The shower being so large and Manchester being so rainy. "
"Daphne: Right this way. "
"Niles: Oh, you forgot to pay the toll. "
"Frasier: Niles "
"Niles: Never mind. "
"Frasier: Now go away "
"Martin: What the hell for? What's going on here? "
"Frasier: Clive is Daphne's old boyfriend; she's trying to let him down easily, by pretending to be married to Niles. "
"Niles: So this is my place. Frasier is staying here temporarily, because he's separated from Maris. "
"Martin: You couldn't stand her either, huh? "
"Niles: That's very amusing. "
"Martin: Do I still live here? "
"Frasier: Yes, of course you do, but I think for this evening it would be best if you just excused yourself. You see, it involves quick thinking and improvisational skills, and a knack for remembering details. "
"Martin: Oh, I never used any of those skills as an undercover cop. "
"Niles: Please don't be offended- "
"Martin: No, I'm not offended, my two sons have just said I've got oatmeal for brains. Daphne and Clive enter with yet more complications. "
"Clive: So, Daphne tells me that you two are both psychiatrists. "
"Frasier: Yes. "
"Clive: Fascinating. Are you a psychiatrist as well, Marty? "
"Martin: Me? No, I'm retired. "
"Clive: What did you do? "
"Martin: I was an astronaut. "
"Clive: Really And you actually flew space missions? "
"Martin: Yeah, a couple. Me and Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin - you know, it was me that gave him his nickname 'Buzz,' You know, most people think it's 'cause he flew fast. Not true He was scared of bees. "
"Frasier: Wh-Who is it? "
"Roz: Open up, Frasier, it's me. "
"Martin: What do you know, it's Maris "
"Roz: Here are your stupid opera glasses. Are we friends again? "
"Frasier: Darling "
"Frasier: You're Maris "
"Roz: What? "
"Frasier: We're married "
"Roz: What? "
"Frasier: Just play along "
"Clive: Well, their little tiff's over. "
"Frasier: Maris Crane, this is Mr. Clive Roddy. "
"Clive: It's a pleasure "
"Roz: It certainly is. So, how long will you be in Seattle? "
"Frasier: Uh, Cupcake? Well, if you'll excuse me, we could do with a moment alone. Come with me, darling. "
"Niles: So, now you've met the whole Crane clan "
"Clive: Although, Daphne, I noticed in the phone book your surname still is Moon. "
"Niles: That must be an old book. Now she hyphenates; it's Moon- Crane. "
"Martin: I remember the first time I ever drove a moon crane. I nearly rolled it into the Sea of Tranquillity. "
"Niles: So Clive, what do you do? "
"Daphne: Still mucking about with cars, I see. [points to some axle grease on his hand] "
"Clive: Oh, my hands? No, I helped a man change his tires on the way over here. Don't have enough time as I used to, what with my business and all. "
"Daphne: Your business? "
"Clive: Well, after you left I remembered the advice you gave me, and it all made sense. "
"Daphne: What advice? "
"Clive: Well, you know, 'get a job you lazy git,' that sort of thing. So I took a few business courses and opened up a little sporting goods shop. Next thing you know I had three of them. "
"Daphne: All these years I've nagged him to make something of himself. And now look at him, a captain of industry, and still as handsome as ever. "
"Niles: Yes, well, send in the clowns "
"Niles: Don't bother, they're here. "
"Frasier: Well, bad news, it seems my Maris has to run off, she's got a previous engagement. "
"Martin: Oh, forget about your engagement, Maris. Stay for dinner "
"Frasier: Well, actually... "
"Roz: I'd love to. "
"Clive: Lovely, we can celebrate you two being reconciled. "
"Roz: That is still tentative, it could go either way. ' "
"Clive: Hello there, what's his name? "
"All: EDDIE "
"TO: "
"Martin: So there I was, floating 20 feet up in the chamber, when some idiot turns off the weightless button and down I come on this big pickaxe we used for moon rocks "
"Clive: And you still walk with a cane. "
"Martin: Que Sera Sera. I better turn in, boys. "
"Frasier: Don't forget your warm glass of Tang. "
"Clive: It was an honour meeting you, Commander. "
"Martin: Yeah, I had fun too. Goodnight, all "
"All: Goodnight. "
"Clive: Delicious meal, Daphne. Can't remember the last time I ate so much. "
"Roz: Well, that explains your fantastic physique. "
"Daphne: Yes, you are looking wonderfully firm. Yes, and that little tummy. "
"Roz: Do you work out? "
"Clive: When I can. Actually, my shops keep me pretty busy. "
"Niles: Daphne and I have our own little excercise regimen. We work up quite a sweat, don't we, darling? "
"Daphne: I can't get over it, it's like you're a whole different person. A WHOLE DIFFERENT PERSON "
"Frasier: Well, who's for coffee? "
"Daphne: I'll give you a hand. "
"Daphne: Would you please tell Roz to stop flirting Has she forgotten she is a married woman? "
"Frasier: Oh, you're one to talk. If you batted your eyelashes any harder, you'd blow out the candles "
"Daphne: You get rid of her now, or it's Rattlesnake Ridge for you. "
"Frasier: You wouldn't "
"Daphne: Oh, wouldn't I? And by the way, Stinky needs a ride. [Frasier gasps] "
"Roz: And according to your love lines, what a naughty little... "
"Frasier: Maris, I don't know about you, but I'm exhausted "
"Roz: See you at home. More wine, please. "
"Daphne: Oh, are you sure that's wise, dear? Remember that blackout you had last month? What am I saying? Of course you don't. "
"Niles: That's what I love about her, her sense of humour. Cookie, darling? "
"Daphne: No thank you, some of us do look after our weight "
"Roz: Now, now, Daphne. You have to keep your strength up. You are eating for two. "
"Clive: You're having a baby? When you were planning on springing that news? "
"Daphne: We don't like to bring that up. It's a sore point around here, what with my sister-in-law being barren and all. "
"Niles: Now, now, it's not her fault. You see, my brother is impotent. "
"Clive: ...Congratulations. Is there a loo I could, er... "
"Niles: Yes, yes, right there by the front door. We call it 'Frasier's Bathroom,' that is why we've monogrammed all the towels with his initials. "
"Frasier: Have you all taken leave of your senses? "
"Daphne: Well, she started it, hanging all over him. "
"Roz: What is your problem? Frasier says the only reason we're doing this is because you wanted to give him the brush-off. "
"Daphne: Well, I changed my mind Didn't you see my signals? "
"Roz: Gee, I missed them, it must have been in the middle of one of my BLACKOUTS "
"Niles: Wait, wait, wait, there's no need to fight, I'll flip a coin. Oh, good news, Roz "
"Roz: Hooray "
"Daphne: Oh, sod off "
"following: "
"Daphne: You'd think with all your dozens and dozens of men, you could at least leave one for me. "
"Roz: Dozens? Did you tell her that? "
"Frasier: Well, forgive me for keeping track "
"Niles: Why are you fighting over that man anyway? He's got all the charm of a cricket bat "
"Roz: You're right. You know what, Daphne? You can have him. You can have him, he's yours "
"Daphne: Oh, fat chance I've got, now that you've told him I'm pregnant How am I supposed to get rid of this bloody baby? "
"Frasier: Hi, coffee? "
"Clive: No, thank you. I really should be going. "
"Daphne: No, no, please, I know what you must think, but we're not what we seem. "
"Clive: You certainly aren't. Look, I know I'm a guest here, so I've kept silent so far. But I'm sorry, I must "
"speak: you're the most appalling family I've ever met. You breaking up with your wife over a pair of opera glasses. And you looking down your nose at me the entire time you were showing off your 'posh flat.' Well, to be honest, mate, I don't think there's anything remotely special about your bathrooms. And you two women, flirting shamelessly with me right in front of your husbands. You having just reconciled with Frasier, and you carrying Niles's baby. Well, I pity your child, Daphne. And I pity any good Manchester girl that comes here to this vile coffee- swilling Sodom and lets it change her like it's changed you. "
"Daphne: But I haven't changed Really, we're not the awful people you think we are. "
"Frasier: No, the truth is we've been lying to you all night "
"Daphne: Yes "
"Clive: Well, I don't care to be lied to anymore. Goodbye, Daphne, Maris, Dr. Crane, Dr. Crane. I'll never understand how two men like you could be spawned from that sweet, courageous old astronaut. "

"Bulldog: Baby, baby. All I’m saying is we should cool it for a while. What’s that saying... er... if you love something, let it go; if it comes back to you... yadda, yadda, yadda? Yeah, that’s it. Don’t get me wrong, I’m really broken up about this. "
"Bulldog: Come on now. No tears. I’ll never forget you either, Sandy. Linda? Really? I thought I was talking to your sister. Oh well, tell her same goes. [hangs up] "
"Roz: Hey Frasier, do you have a minute? "
"Frasier: Yes, of course, Roz. What is it? "
"Roz: Well, you’re not going to like this idea. You’re going to complain and make up excuses and then say no anyway. "
"Frasier: Those are the very words I would use to woo my dear Lilith. "
"Roz: OK, here goes. I have this friend and I think you two would really hit it off... "
"Frasier: And you were wondering if I might meet her for a drink, which might lead to dinner, and then after that who knows where? "
"Roz: Yes, exactly. "
"Frasier: Ooh, oh Roz. Do you hear that? "
"Roz: What? "
"Frasier: If you listen very carefully you can actually hear my skin crawling "
"Roz: I know, blind dates stink. But she’s my friend and I’m worried about her. "
"Frasier: Oh, Roz. "
"Roz: When was the last time you were with a woman? Seems like almost a year. "
"Frasier: Oh, it has not been that long. I mean, that is a laugh Hah The last time was... er... well, let’s see... Well, the tree was still up. Oh, God "
"Roz: Her name is Sharon. She’s five-seven... "
"Frasier: Oh Roz, I’m not interested. "
"Roz: But she’s an incredible person. She’s smart, she’s funny, she’s a former pro-golfer. She just hasn’t met the right guy. "
"Frasier: A woman golfer. Are we quite certain there is a right guy? "
"Roz: She dates men. "
"Frasier: Not this one. "
"Roz: She plays chess. She loves your show. [he leaves through the door] And I know this sort of thing isn’t supposed to matter to people like you but I’ve seen her in the showers at the gym and she has a body that makes Bo Derek look like Bo Diddley "
"Frasier: A chess player, did you say? "
"Martin: Look at these pants. "
"Daphne: Oh dear, Mr. Crane. Did Eddie drag you through the puddles again? "
"Martin: Every last one of them. Eddie, get in here. Eddie, I mean now [A very sheepish Eddie walks in slowly, keeping his head down] What am I going to do with you? My favourite shoes are soaked. Eddie, look at me when I’m talking to you. "
"Daphne: You’re doing it again. "
"Martin: What? "
"Daphne: You’re acting like one of those nut jobs in the park who treat their pets like children. "
"Martin: Yeah? Well, when you do it outside you’re a nut. When you do it inside it’s your own damn business. Eddie, go to your room "
"Daphne: Don’t worry about your shoes. I’ll get them all dried out for you. "
"Martin: Well, I hope. They’re not just any shoes, you know. These are Mocarbies - the most comfortable shoes made. Air- cushioned in-soles, deep flannel lining. You know, I remember one anniversary I surprised Hester with a pair of Lady Mocarbies. I don’t remember which anniversary, but I know it ended with a zero. "
"Daphne: I don’t doubt that "
"Martin: Oh, all right, I forgive you. I love you too. "
"Martin: You’ll always be my very best boy. "
"Frasier: You know, Dad, there are some fathers who actually praise their sons and whistle at their dog? "
"Martin: New suit, huh? Who’s the lucky girl? "
"Frasier: Well, if you must know I’m meeting a friend of Roz’s today after work, but it’s no big deal. "
"Martin: Well, congratulations. What’s it been? A year? "
"Frasier: It has not been that long "
"Martin: I remember the tree was still up. "
"Daphne: Well, look at you all dressed up. "
"Frasier: Yes, it’s a new suit. Yes, I’m meeting a woman. And yes, it has been a while. "
"Daphne: Thanks, that reminds me. I have to order my cards. "
"Frasier: Daphne, are you finished here with the microwave? "
"Daphne: Oh, no "
"Martin: My Mocarbies "
"Daphne: I didn’t mean to leave them in there so long. "
"Frasier: Yes, well, English cooking strikes again "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Well, I think you should be happy that one of your patients feels healthy enough to terminate his therapy. "
"Niles: I would, but it’s happened so often lately I find myself in financial straits. Deep financial straits. Look at this "
"belt: Spanish leather "
"Frasier: Yes, well if Mr. Blackwell comes in I’ll create a diversion, you can make a dash for it. "
"Niles: Obviously the time has come for me to expand my practice, so I’m placing an ad in the Seattle 'Style' magazine. "
"Frasier: An advertisement? Isn’t that a bit commercial for a psychiatrist? "
"Niles: Said Dr. Pot to Dr. Kettle Besides, a highly respected obstetrician on my floor did it and now his waiting room has more swollen bellies than a Buddhist temple. [laughs at his joke before handing Frasier the ad] I’m on my way to call it in. I just wanted to run it by you. "
"Frasier: All right. 'Dr. Niles Crane, Jung specialist. Servicing individuals, couples, groups. Satisfaction guaranteed. Tell me where it hurts.' Well, that’s just excellent, Niles. All you’re missing now is a very tasteful cartoon of you smiling brightly and holding a shrunken head "
"Niles: Sorry, I didn’t hear you. I was too distracted by your face going by on the side of a bus. I’m off. "
"Roz: Hey, wild thing. "
"Niles: Yes, hello. "
"Roz: Look, we have on the same belt. "
"Niles: Oh my God "
"Frasier: Hi, Roz. "
"Roz: Hey, Frasier. OK, Sharon’s gonna be here any minute. "
"Frasier: You didn’t say anything to her? "
"Roz: No, not a word. She has no idea this is a set-up. "
"Frasier: Good, good. Now, listen. If I don’t like her I will simply excuse myself and leave. But if I do like her I will find some polite and discrete way of hinting to you that you may go... "
"Roz: Hi, Sharon "
"Frasier: Beat it, Roz "
"Sharon: Hi, Roz. "
"Roz: Look who I ran into. My boss – Dr. Frasier Crane. Frasier, this is Sharon Payton "
"Sharon: Oh, pleased to meet you. I’m a big fan of your show. "
"Frasier: Thank you. "
"Sharon: I’m sure you’re tired of hearing that. You probably get it all the time. "
"Frasier: Oh, well, not lately "
"Roz: Listen, Sharon, I’m so sorry to do this to you but I just got a call from the office and it’s urgent and I have to go. "
"Sharon: Oh, sure, that’s all right. "
"Frasier: Well, you know, as long as you’re here you might as well join me. "
"Sharon: That’d be nice. "
"Roz: OK. "
"Frasier: Bye, Roz. "
"Sharon: You know, I really do love listening to your show. I think it’s because you have such a soothing voice. "
"Frasier: What a kind thing to say. "
"Sharon: I even called in once. "
"Frasier: Really? May I ask what the problem was? "
"Sharon: Well, I’m terribly competitive, which is great for sports - I used to play pro-golf – but sometimes it seeps into my personal life. "
"Frasier: Ah, well, I don’t think that’s too great a problem, but if I were to make a recommendation it might be to start seeing a therapist. "
"Bulldog: Whoa Hello, gorgeous. "
"Frasier: Hello, Bulldog. "
"Bulldog: Not you. Hey, aren’t you gonna introduce me? "
"Frasier: Well, actually I wasn’t, no "
"Bulldog: Bob Briscoe. "
"Sharon: Sharon Payton. "
"Frasier: Yes, good to see you, Bulldog. Don’t be a stranger. "
"Bulldog: Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute. Sharon Payton - I know you. [grabs the nearest seat that happens to have someone sitting on it] LPGA. You won the Denver Open in 1992. "
"Frasier: 1992? You know, that’s a fabulous year for a particular Chambertin I took a shine too... "
"Sharon: I know you too. You’re that guy that says golf is not a sport. "
"Bulldog: Well, it’s not. "
"Sharon: Really? "
"Bulldog: Yeah. No cheerleaders, no blood and the only cups involved are in the ground "
"Frasier: You know, this reminds me of a debate I had with my brother Niles about whether or not Steven Sondheim is really light opera... "
"Sharon: You know, I have a theory that people who put down golf do so because they can’t play well. "
"Bulldog: Is that a challenge? "
"Sharon: It might be. "
"Bulldog: If we leave right now we can get in 9 holes. "
"Sharon: Loser buys dinner. "
"Bulldog: I got a 9 handicap. "
"Sharon: You’re on. Frasier, would you like to join us? "
"Frasier: Well, no, I don’t play. "
"Sharon: Well, it was really nice meeting you. "
"Frasier: Likewise. "
"Sharon: I’ll get my coat. "
"Frasier: Bulldog Roz set this up that I might meet Sharon. Until you got here things were going in a very positive direction. "
"Bulldog: Yeah, well, things seem to have changed, haven’t they? What do you eggheads call that? Irony? "
"Frasier: Is there nothing I can do to appeal to your sense of decency? "
"Bulldog: Hey, I have no sense of decency. That way my other senses are enhanced "
"Martin: ...but the real secret to Mocarbies is that they mold themselves to the shape of your foot. Now my problem was always hammer toes. If you had hammertoes you had a hell of a time buying shoes. But Mocarbies fit over my hammer toes like a glove. Funny, you know? When you’re young you dream about fame and fortune. When you get to my age all you really want out of life is a comfy pair of shoes. "
"Daphne: Right now I’d settle for never hearing the words 'hammer toes' again "
"Martin: Hey, don’t give me any attitude. Wasn’t me that nuked the Mocarbies. "
"Daphne: I’m not the one who can’t remember where the store is where you bought the damn shoes. "
"Martin: Just drive. I’ll tell you when to stop... STOP "
"Daphne: Is that it? "
"Martin: It’s a red light In this country we stop for those. "
"Daphne: All right, all right. "
"Martin: Woman driver "
"Daphne: Hammer toes "
"TO: "
"Roz: Frasier. "
"Frasier: What? Oh, oh. Haven’t you spoken with Sharon? "
"Roz: I tried but she wasn’t home all weekend. [punching Frasier on the arm] Frasier "
"Frasier: Look, before you snap my behind with a wet towel, last time I saw Sharon she was leaving Café Nervosa with Bulldog. "
"Roz: Frasier How could you let that happen? "
"Frasier: Well, I don’t know. The whole thing was sort of a blur. We were talking about golf and something called a handicap, the next thing I know I’m sitting there with a cappuccino muttering to myself in a very soothing voice. "
"Roz: I’m sorry. "
"Frasier: It’s all right, Roz. It’s just the whole thing catapulted me back to high school. You know me as an adult, but back then I was rather an un-athletic, bookish sort. "
"Roz: Get out "
"Frasier: Jocks were the bane of my existence. They would always call me a 'weenie' and steal all the girls that I wanted. "
"Roz: Oh Frasier, you must have had some girlfriends. "
"Frasier: Friends, yeah, yeah. Any time they wanted a sensitive shoulder to cry on, until some blond-headed pillar of testosterone would come by and it was, 'Bye Frasier, we can study later.' I’d head home to Niles and we’d put on 'The Brandenberg Concertos' and play air violin. "
"Roz: Jeez, what a couple of Nerdlingers "
"Frasier: I suppose you were Miss Popular at High School? "
"Roz: I would say yes. "
"Frasier: I’m guessing that explains why, too "
"Bulldog: Hey guys. What a weekend... "
"Roz: Listen, Bulldog. Sharon is my friend and you’d better not hurt her "
"Bulldog: Hurt? Hurt her? I'm crazy about her I never felt this way before. You know, on my way to work, all these songs on the radio suddenly made sense to me? Have you ever listened to the words to 'Time in a Bottle'? It’s so beautiful, man; I had to pull over. "
"Roz: Oh my God. It’s in love "
"Bulldog: Last night for the first time in my life I actually said those three little words – 'stay for breakfast.' "
"Frasier: You had sex with Sharon? "
"Bulldog: Doc, please We 'made love.' You know what? I gotta call her. No, wait. No, I gotta play hard to get. But I miss the sound of her voice. I’m calling her. No, wait. It’s too needy. Chicks hate that. I shouldn’t call her. But I want to Doc, what should I do? "
"Frasier: Don’t ask me. I don’t even know who you are "
"Martin: This was it. This was the Mocarbies store. Now it’s gone, and so are the only shoes I’ve ever loved. "
"Daphne: Mr. Crane, look at me. We’re talking here about something that’s old and smelly and dirty. "
"Tramp: Hey "
"Martin: Not you. We’re talking about Mocarbies. "
"Tramp: Ah Great shoes. They used to sell them here. "
"Martin: What happened to the store? "
"Tramp: Moved. "
"Daphne: Do you know where? "
"Tramp: Yeah. It’ll cost you. "
"Martin: How much? "
"Tramp: Not money. I want a kiss. "
"Daphne: What? "
"Martin: You heard him. "
"Daphne: Mr. Crane "
"Martin: You heard him. You owe me. It’s only a kiss. "
"Tramp: Not her. "
"TO: "
"Frasier: This is Dr. Frasier Crane, KACL 780 Talk radio. "
"Niles: I thought you’d never finish. "
"Frasier: You know, Niles, what say I buy us dinner with a lot of martinis? "
"Niles: Sounds great, except for the dinner part "
"Frasier: I take it you had a bad day too? "
"Niles: I had an abysmal day. Remember the ad I placed? "
"Frasier: Oh yes - 'Dr. Niles Crane, Jung specialist,' blah blah blah. "
"Niles: Yes. Well, they’ve made a tiny little typo. See if you can find it. "
"Frasier: 'Hung specialist.' Oh, my "
"Niles: The rest they got perfectly. 'Servicing individuals, couples, groups. Satisfaction guaranteed.' 'Tell me where it hurts' "
"Frasier: Well... any calls? "
"Niles: It’s a telethon, Frasier. "
"Frasier: Yes. We’ll start with double martinis. "
"Bulldog: Hey Doc, wait a second. I need the name of one of those fancy restaurants you go to. Hey, hi Sharon. It’s me, Bob. I had a great time last night. Listen, how about dinner tonight? You do? All right, how about tomorrow night? Hey, it’s a good thing I’m not paranoid – I’d think you were dumping me Whoa, I walked into that one Yeah, me too. Good luck, Sharon. "
"Frasier: I’m sorry, Bulldog. "
"Niles: Me too. I’ll call Francois, see if he can get us a table on the patio. "
"Pete: Ten seconds, Bulldog. "
"Bulldog: Oh, right, right. "
"Frasier: Bulldog – are you going to be all right? "
"Bulldog: Me? Huh, are you kidding? I’m the Bulldog "
"Bulldog: Attention, sports fans, you’re in the Doghouse [barks, but breaks off midway] First, some weekend scores. In football the Packers crushed the Saints 42 to 10 and the 49ers humiliated the Patriots 35 to 7. And in golf... "
"Bulldog: Golf? Hey, golf sucks. Let’s go to calls. [puts a caller through] Hey, you’re in the Doghouse. Put on a flea collar "
"Niles: We have the table, Frasier, but Francois says he can only hold it for ten minutes. "
"Frasier: In a minute. "
"booth: "
"Jerry: What’s up with the rumour that the Seahawks are thinking of leaving Seattle again? "
"Bulldog: I have no respect for them, man. Anyone who has their fun, then they just leave you... hey, to hell with them, right? We’ll get another team. A team that- a team that will never leave us... [breaks down completely into tears] ...a team we can love forever. "
"studio: "
"Roz: You gotta go to commercial. "
"Pete: I already did. "
"Frasier: Bulldog, are you going to be all right? Do you think you can take the show? "
"Roz: Wait, Bulldog. We need a tape. Where’s 'The Best of Bulldog'? "
"Bulldog: She took the best of Bulldog "
"Pete: We got dead air in fifteen seconds. "
"Roz: Great. OK, I’ll go get Bulldog. You take over the show. "
"Frasier: Me? A sports show? "
"Roz: You’re the only one here. "
"Frasier: OK, sports enthusiasts. This is Dr. Frasier Crane filling in for Bob 'Bulldog' Briscoe. You’re on the air. "
"Mike: This is Mike. I wanted to talk to Bulldog but you’ll do. So what’s your take on the damn Yankees this season? "
"Frasier: Are you speaking of the frothy musical adaptation, or the baseball team of which I know nothing? "
"Mike: What a weenie "
"Frasier: Doesn’t that take me back? But he brings up a good point. You see, while I’m on the air, please feel free to call up about anything other than sports. Please. Hello, you’re on the air. "
"Jake: Yeah. You think it was a good idea for the Sonics to give up those draft choices so they could free up some money under the cap, you know, to go after a wide body to help them in the paint? "
"Frasier: Yes You’re on the air. "
"TO: "
"Roz: Bulldog, I know you’re in there. Get out here [turns to see the man who doesn’t look pleased to see her] Oh, give me a break, Leonard – like you haven’t fantasized about this moment. "
"Bulldog: Go away, Roz. "
"Roz: Will you grow up? So you got dumped. You got a little payback for the way you’ve treated women all your life. Besides, the Bulldog I know doesn’t get sad. He gets angry. "
"Bulldog: You’re right THIS STINKS THIS IS TOTAL... ...total B.S. "
"Roz: If you don’t come out in the next thirty seconds I’m going to reach in there and grab you out by your ankles "
"Niles: Hello, Roz. Playing hard to get? "
"Roz: It’s Bulldog. You’re a psychiatrist, help him. "
"Niles: As distressed as I am by his condition, he’s not the only one who’s suffering here. In eight minutes Frasier and I are going to lose our patio table. "
"Roz: Well, as long as Frasier is filling in for Bulldog you’re not going anywhere. "
"Niles: You poor man. Help is at hand "
"Bulldog: No, no shrinks. I hate shrinks. You’re all a bunch of wimps, weirdos... [comes out the cubicle and collapses in tears on Niles’s shoulders] Help me "
"Niles: There, there. I’m here for you. And you’re over there for me. Well, I sense you’re in a great deal of pain. "
"Bulldog: Yeah. Make it stop. "
"Niles: No. The first step towards healing is not to bury the pain, but to feel it at its fullest depth. "
"Niles: OK, well before security arrives, let’s skip onto step two. "
"Frasier: What is going on? "
"Niles: Excuse me, Bulldog. Frasier, please, we are in session. "
"Frasier: Look, Niles, we have to pull this man together in minutes, not in a lifetime "
"Niles: How dare you talk to me like that "
"Frasier: We don’t have the time for this. Now get out "
"Niles: All right, all right. Bulldog, I’m referring you to my brother. Frasier, I’ll call Francois and tell him there’s been a death in the family. That ought to buy us another ten minutes. "
"Frasier: All right, Bulldog. Look, we’re on a newsbreak. You have got to pull yourself together, because there is no way I’m enduring anymore of that humiliation "
"Bulldog: I’m not going out there, man. "
"Frasier: You have got to I can’t even decipher the abbreviations on the scoresheets. I’m guessing by your producer’s guffaws that 'IND' is not the Cleveland Independents "
"Bulldog: I just never felt this way about a chick before. I was even thinking about me and her having kids. Isn’t that scary? "
"Frasier: Positively bone chilling. "
"Bulldog: It hurts like hell. "
"Frasier: I know, I know, Bulldog. You know, often through pain we can achieve emotional growth. It reminds me of a paper I recently presented to the Vancouver Psychiatric Association. The ground of my discourse was that the sufferer - i.e., you... "
"Bulldog: Doc, Doc, you’re hurting my head here Can you stop being a shrink and just be like a guy. "
"Frasier: SCREW HER "
"Bulldog: What? "
"Frasier: Yeah, you don’t need her. She’s trash "
"Bulldog: Yeah, that’s right. "
"Frasier: You’re better off without her, we both are "
"Bulldog: I like the sound of this. "
"Frasier: Yeah, so do I. Unattractive yet liberating, rather like the one and only time I wore a European bathing suit. [realising he’s going off track] I’m sorry. SHE’S A BITCH "
"Bulldog: Hey, she wasn’t even that hot. "
"Frasier: You’re right. All she did was save you the trouble of having to dump her "
"Bulldog: I never thought about that. "
"Frasier: There you go "
"Bulldog: I’m feeling a little better, Doc. "
"Frasier: That’s right. "
"Bulldog: Thanks. It’s great talking to you "
"Frasier: Likewise. You know I could talk like this for another thirty seconds. "
"Frasier: She was nothing She was less than nothing "
"Bulldog: Yeah, right. "
"Frasier: Tomorrow you’re gonna find someone even hotter, and you know what you’re gonna do? "
"Bulldog: What? "
"Frasier: You’re gonna have your fun with her, and then you’re gonna DUMP her just for the hell of it "
"Bulldog: Yeah, DUMP HER "
"Frasier: And you know what? You’re not gonna feel bad about it at all And you know why? BECAUSE WE’RE GUYS AND THAT’S WHAT GUYS DO "
"Niles: Distressing news, "
"Frasier: Francois gave away our table. "
"Frasier: SCREW HIM "
"Niles: Excuse me? "
"Frasier: You heard what I said We don’t need him or his stinky little restaurant There are plenty of restaurants in town I say we go somewhere we don’t even need a reservation "
"Frasier: Thank you, Niles. "
"Niles: You’re welcome. "
"Frasier: Yes, you know, if we hasten, perhaps we can catch the first seating at Cigar Volante. "

"Gil: Well, look who's up "
"TO: "
"Jimmy: So it's my parents. I don't know, they're just like, really stupid. "
"Frasier: May I ask how old you are? "
"Jimmy: Fourteen. "
"Frasier: Well, hang on, Jimmy. Your parents are going to be stupid for another seven years. "
"Jimmy: Whoa Seven years? That's like, longer than I'll be in high school "
"Frasier: I salute your optimism. We'll be right back after this. "
"Frasier: Oh god, Roz. A teenager who's embarrassed by his parents? I mean, please. Can't you come up with something a little more challenging for me? "
"Roz: Well, it was either him or our old pal, Rudy the Crier. "
"Frasier: Oh, Rudy the Crier. Oh God. He's been on three times in the last month. You put him on again, he won't be the only one who's crying. God, I'm in a dry spell. Where are the souls in genuine torment? The people teetering on the brink of genuine despair? "
"Roz: Oh, they'll be back. The holidays are just around the corner. "
"Frasier: Well, perhaps you're right. Oh, Roz, I've got a question I'd like to ask you. "
"Roz: Shoot. "
"Frasier: Have you ever had a recurring dream of an intimate nature about someone... oh, a... well, a co-worker? "
"Roz: Oh, no. Why'd you tell me? "
"Frasier: Oh, Roz "
"Roz: Oh, now it's gonna be creepy everytime you look at me through the glass "
"Frasier: Roz, not you "
"Roz: So who is it then? "
"Frasier: Oh, I'm not going to go into the specifics. "
"Roz: Gina in accounting? "
"Frasier: Look, I'm not gonna do this "
"Roz: Sheila, the slow intern? "
"Frasier: Forget I even mentioned it. "
"Gil: Knock knock... "
"Frasier: "
"Gil: Frasier, I've come to tempt you. "
"Frasier: Really? "
"Gil: I'm reviewing the new pastry chef at Chez Shea. [reveals an eclair] And I "
"quote: 'His amaretto eclair is so sinful, it will send you scurrying to your local padre for absolution.' "
"Frasier: Uh... no, thank you, Gil. I'm on a diet. "
"Gil: Oh, come now You know you want it... "
"Frasier: Oh, no no no... I really don't [shoos Gil out the door] Off you go. Bye-bye. "
"Roz: Oh, my god "
"Frasier: What? "
"Roz: It was Gil "
"Frasier: I never said that "
"Roz: Then why are you blushing? "
"Frasier: Oh, don't be ridiculous "
"Roz: Your ears are turning bright red "
"Frasier: I am not blushing "
"Roz: You are "
"Frasier: Still not blushing "
"Rudy: ...just lying there in the hospital bed. She lifted her head off the pillow, looked up and said, 'I love you,' and then she was gone. "
"Frasier: Rudy, stop crying. We've gone over this before. What was our agreement about sad movies? "
"Rudy: I shouldn't watch them. "
"Frasier: Exactly. Now go get a cool washcloth and try to bring down the puffiness around your eyes. Please... stay away from sad or depressing things... which, at this moment, includes listening to the Dr. Frasier Crane Show. Well, let's shoot it to the news. That's it for today. This is Dr. Frasier Crane. Oh, my God Well, close the record books. That was just the dullest three hours in the history of the Frasier Crane Show "
"Roz: Oh, come on. It wasn't so bad. What about that woman who was so concerned about her appearance she wouldn't leave the house? "
"Frasier: That was a commercial I believe Miss Clairol solved the problem Well, I'll see you tomorrow. [he moves to exit, then turns back] Oh Oh, Roz... about that dream I mentioned to you earlier... uh... this goes without saying, but I'd rather you didn't share that with anyone else. "
"Roz: Oh, sure. "
"Betty: Hi, dreamboy "
"Frasier: I hate you Couldn't keep your big mouth shut, could you? Just exactly when did you find the time to spread the news? "
"Roz: You don't think I was listening to your show, do you? "
"Bulldog: Comin' through Oh, Doc... I got to rub this one in a little... "
"Frasier: All right, look, Bulldog... before you start to ridicule me, yes, yes I had a dream about Gil. And yes, it had some erotic elements, but... [notices Bulldog's surprised expression] You have absolutely no idea what I'm talking about, do you? "
"Bulldog: I do now Whoa "
"Frasier: Look, let's just forget it. What delightful little jibe did you have prepared for me? "
"Bulldog: Oh, I was gonna tell you your show today just broke the snooze meter, but now I want to hear about you greasin' Gil's cookie sheet "
"Frasier: I'm on a bus to Hell. "
"TO: "
"Niles: So I returned to the dry-cleaners yet a third time. I hardly need to tell you how the story ends. "
"Frasier: Just tell me when the story ends. "
"Niles: Fine. They realigned my pleats, The End. "
"Frasier: Sorry, Niles. [they get their coffees and sit at a nearby table] I'm just a bit distracted today. You see, this morning, a... a man from my building approached me with a very intriguing problem. It seems he's been having a recurring dream. "
"Niles: Oh, please. That little gambit didn't work when we were in knee socks. What was your dream, Frasier? "
"Frasier: Oh, all right It's been tormenting me. I haven't been able to sleep in weeks now. It's a bit hazy but... it starts out in a seedy motel room. I'm naked. "
"Niles: Interesting. "
"Frasier: Yes, well... I roll over and discover on my forearm a "
"tattoo: the word 'Chesty.' "
"Niles: Interesting. "
"Frasier: Then the shower turns off and out from the bathroom steps... a man. All right, go ahead, let me have it "
"Niles: Are you saying that now, or is that a quote from the dream? "
"Frasier: Please? We're both too intelligent to waste time on the obvious interpretation. "
"Niles: Yes. But you must admit, it's rather intriguing. "
"Frasier: Would you stop? It's obviously screaming for a Jungian interpretation. The sexuality in the dream is surely symbolic of some deeper, non-sexual conflict. "
"Niles: All right. "
"Gil: Good afternoon, Frasier. "
"Frasier: Gil. "
"Gil: A little birdie tells me I was featured in your midnight movie. "
"Frasier: That's very clever. Off you go. "
"Gil: Very well. I'll see you tomorrow. Or should I say, 'See you in your dreams'? "
"Niles: In this dream of yours, were there any cigars, bananas or short, blunt swords? "
"Frasier: Would you stop it? I'm 43 - a little late for latency. "
"Rebecca: You guys okay over here? "
"Niles: Oh, we're fine. "
"Frasier: Well... you must be new here. I surely would have remembered such a pretty face as yours. "
"Niles: You're overcompensating. "
"Frasier: Right. We're fine. Bye-bye. I'm just baffled, Niles. Obviously, Gil Chesterton explains 'Chesty' but little else. "
"Niles: Perhaps you should tackle this from a free-association standpoint. "
"Frasier: God, must we? "
"Niles: Well, now... focus on any detail in the motel room. What's the first thing that pops into your mind? "
"Frasier: Uh... a crescent-shaped lamp. "
"Niles: Perfect - crescent-shaped lamp. Run with that. Crescent... moon... Daphne Moon... French maid... brass bed... satin robe... "
"Frasier: Niles This is my dream "
"Niles: I was just showing you the process. "
"Frasier: You were three words away from a cigarette "
"Niles: Your turn "
"Frasier: All right. "
"Niles: Crescent lamp. "
"Frasier: Crescent... croissant... butter... apricot jam... hunger... food... diet My God, I've been on a diet. Do you think that's useful? "
"Niles: You could stand to lose a few pounds. "
"Frasier: Just wait a minute. Gil is a restaraunt critic - a gourmet. Perhaps he's symbolic of the food I've been denying myself. "
"Niles: That would explain why you're naked in the dream. It's when we're naked that we're most self-conscious about our bodies. "
"Frasier: Yes, and most vulnerable to the way society 'tattoos' us with labels about our appearance God, that's it, Niles The dream is simply telling me that I've been too rigid about my diet "
"Niles: Well, you'll know tonight. If this is the correct interpretation, the conflict will have passed from your unconscious to your conscious mind. "
"Frasier: Yes, the dream will have served its purpose. "
"Niles: And you will no longer be plagued by it. "
"Frasier: Oh, God, Niles. I've nailed it all right. I really have. Finally, for the first time in weeks they'll be no tequila bottles, no tattoo, no half-naked man in my bed. [he looks up to see Rebecca standing at their table] So then, the Rabbi says... "
"TO: "
"Woman: Oh, I'm sorry... wrong room. "
"Gil: That does it. We're finding another motel. "
"TO: "
"Daphne: Someone followed me again last night. "
"Martin: Ah, you're just being paranoid. "
"Daphne: I'm telling you, they're onto me. "
"Martin: Come on. Nobody could recognize you after all that plastic surgery. "
"Daphne: That's what Marlena thought. "
"Martin: Marlena got sloppy. She never should have gone back to Zurich. "
"Daphne: I just don't want any more bloodshed. "
"Martin: Relax. You're home free. "
"Daphne: You don't know the Woodchuck and his ways. "
"Daphne: Oh, we're terrible "
"Martin: We are? You are 'The Woodchuck and his ways'? "
"Daphne: You know, we really should stop doing this. It's not nice. "
"Martin: Ah, you're right. We won't do it anymore. "
"Daphne: How'd you get the stuff through Customs? "
"Martin: They never check the wooden leg. "
"TO: Frasier's apartment. Frasier is pacing the living room as "
"Frasier: The answer has got to be in there somewhere "
"Niles: Here's something. 'Dreams as an expression of wish fulfillment.' "
"Frasier: Moving on. "
"Daphne: Goodness, are you two still here? "
"Martin: What are you working on? "
"Frasier: Nothing. "
"Niles: I'm helping Frasier interpret a dream he's been having. You know, maybe Dad can help. "
"Frasier: No, no, no... don't want to bore Dad with the details of this particular dream. "
"Niles: Dreams can be rooted in childhood experience. Maybe Dad remembers something you've repressed. "
"Martin: Gee, I don't know. If it's about when you were a kid I've repressed a lot of that myself. "
"Frasier: Niles, this is not a dream I wish to share with Dad, thank you very much. "
"Niles: Well, we've exhausted every other interpretation. So, I guess it's back to dreams as wish fulfillment... "
"Frasier: Oh, Dad... [he moves to the kitchen where Martin is making a sandwich] Would you mind listening to my dream to see if it conjures up any memories from my childhood? "
"Martin: Oh, come on. You're making too much out of this. It's a dream. Dreams are weird. "
"Frasier: Please, Dad. I wouldn't ask if it weren't really bothering me. "
"Martin: Well, all right... go on. "
"Frasier: All right... it starts out in a little motel room. I have a tattoo on my arm - 'Chesty'... "
"Martin: See? That's weird. "
"Frasier: Yes. Then out from the bathroom steps a... All right, now before I continue, let me remind you that this is a dream. Not to be confused with reality. [Martin nods, still busy with his sandwich] Out from the bathroom steps a man... [off Martin's concerned expression] -eating lion "
"Martin: Oh, see? There again, weird. Look, dreams come, they go. They don't mean anything. Except, you know, if you're lucky, every once in awhile you might have one that's a lot of fun. Like, you hit a home run in the World Series or you're in the jungle with Jayne Mansfield and she gets bit by a snake. "
"Frasier: Thank you, Dad. "
"Martin: You know who Jayne Mansfield is, don't you? "
"Frasier: Yes, Dad. "
"Martin: You know what you do when you're bit by a snake, don't you? "
"Frasier: Yes, Dad. "
"Martin: Wish I knew what I had for dinner that night. "
"Daphne: Oh, I get it. Chesty refers to Gil Chesterton. "
"Frasier: Niles, you gossipy fishwife "
"Daphne: There's no reason to feel self-conscious, Dr. Crane. We've all had dreams like that. I had one about a girl I shared a flat with once - a gymnast. "
"Niles: Go on, Daphne. This could be significant. "
"Daphne: Well, I remember we were doing stretches in the gymnasium, when suddenly we decided to take off all our clothes and go for a bounce on the trampoline. The next thing you know, I'm chasing her around the pommel horse. Oh, never mind... "
"Niles: This could help us. "
"Daphne: Well, actually, I do have a theory of my own about your dream, if you'd like to hear it. "
"Frasier: What the hell. "
"Daphne: Well... in your dream, who was in the shower? Gil. What is a shower? Running water. Who needs water? Fish. What do fish have? Gills Do you see where I'm going? "
"Frasier: Insane? "
"Daphne: It could be a dream about the loss of a beloved childhood pet. "
"Martin: Thanks a lot, Eddie. Forty-five minutes in the park, you don't have to go. I get one bite into my sandwich and you give me the look. "
"Daphne: Mr. Crane, did Dr. Crane ever have a goldfish growing up? "
"Martin: A fish? "
"Daphne: Yes, as a pet. "
"Martin: How would I know? That was Hester's department. Come on, let's go. "
"Niles: Frasier, are you thinking what I'm thinking? "
"Frasier: That Dad can interpret the looks from his dog and has only the spottiest recollections of our childhoods? "
"Niles: No. No, no, no. Hester - Hesty. The tattoo - that's only one letter away from Chesty "
"Frasier: Niles, are you saying that the dream could have been about mother? "
"Niles: Well? "
"Frasier: I suppose I could have misread the tattoo. [rolls up his shirt sleeve] Yes, yes... this freckle pattern here on my arm could be mistaken for a 'C.' "
"Daphne: And what swims in the sea? Fish All right, all right I'll go. "
"Niles: Well, so the tattoo could have said 'Hesty.' But the problem is, I don't ever remember Dad calling her that. "
"Frasier: But who's to say he didn't? "
"Both: Dad, Dad... Dad, Dad "
"Martin: What? "
"Frasier: Did you ever have a nickname for Mother? "
"Martin: Oh, for God's sakes Is this to do with that stupid dream? "
"Frasier: Dad, this is really important "
"Niles: Any pet name? A term of endearment? "
"Martin: Well... when we were first married I used to call her 'Honey.' And then... there was a time after that that I started calling her 'Sweetie.' "
"Frasier: I'm sure there's a delicious anecdote behind each one of those. But did you ever call her 'Hesty'? "
"Martin: 'Hesty'? "
"Frasier: Oh, come on, think, man Even once Once, in all the years you lived together? "
"Martin: I- I guess... "
"Frasier: Really? "
"Martin: Yeah, maybe once... "
"Frasier: Oh, thank you Dad Well, there it is I must have heard him call her 'Hesty' once and neatly tucked it away into my subconscious. "
"Niles: Of course, it's so obvious Gil is a food critic. Food, criticism... "
"Both: Mother "
"Niles: It's the classic Oedipal dream "
"Frasier: Yes, yes... only I was so frightened by my sexual urges to be with my mother that I transformed her into a man Oh, what a relief I've been wringing my hands over nothing. I mean, it's okay. All I want to do is have sex with my dead mother "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Mom? Mommy? "
"Gil: Patience, Daddy "
"TO: "
"TO: "
"Martin: You'd think by now I'd know better than to have that third Slim Jim before going to bed. Couldn't sleep either, huh? "
"Frasier: No. Frankly, I'm sort of afraid to go back to sleep. It's that damn dream again. "
"Martin: Oh, what are you worried about? It's just a dream. Worst case scenario - the man-eating lion leaps on top of you and mauls you. "
"Frasier: I'm sorry, Dad, I wasn't completely truthful with you before. The dream is really about me in a motel room with a male companion, Gil Chesterton. "
"Martin: You don't care if I ever sleep again, do you? "
"Frasier: Dad, please, I'd really like to discuss this "
"Martin: No, Frasier, please. This makes me very uncomfortable. "
"Frasier: Dad, please... "
"Martin: I know, I know... in your generation, men talk about everything. Everything's out in the open. [he begins to nervously clean the refrigerator and countertop, avoiding eye contact] You know what really drives me crazy is the way you all touch each other. Everybody hugs, you know? In my generation it was a... a handshake. That was good enough. Maybe if you felt especially close to someone you'd touch him on the shoulder, but never for more than two seconds. And don't talk to me about football players patting people's butts and everything, because that's different - that's sports, that's like war. Now, goodnight, son. [exits to the living room] "
"Frasier: Dad... "
"Martin: Look, if you want to tell me something, write it on a post- it and stick it on the fridge. "
"Frasier: Look, I really want to talk about this [Martin finally stops and faces Frasier] I've exhausted every other possible interpretation of this dream. Is it possible my subconscious is trying to tell me something about my sexuality? "
"Martin: Oh, that's ridiculous "
"Frasier: Is it? I was sensitive as a child; I didn't go in for sports. God, it's every cliche in the book. Surely it must have occurred to you at some point? You refused to take me to see 'West Side Story' on my eighth birthday. "
"Martin: Well, because of the gangs. That's scary for kids. "
"Frasier: Even gangs that dance? "
"Martin: Especially gangs that dance All right. Yeah... okay, yeah, I thought about it. But no, Frasier, no... I don't believe that. And you know why? Because you would have known by now. Your unconscious or whatever the hell you call it could no more have kept its yap shut than the rest of you. "
"Frasier: I suppose you're right. "
"Martin: Yeah. Now, come on, it's after 3"
":00. You're gonna be all worn out before your show tomorrow. "
"Frasier: What a tragedy that would be. "
"Martin: Now what are you complaining about? "
"Frasier: Oh, I don't know. I just haven't had any really interesting calls lately. I'm beginning to question whether I'm not bored with psychiatry. "
"Martin: Boy, you'd never know it with the way you got your nose stuck in all those books. "
"Frasier: That's true. The one saving grace about this dream is it's given me a chance to flex my analytical muscle a bit. "
"Martin: Ah, maybe it wasn't so bad after all. "
"Frasier: Wait a minute. Could that be what this has been all about? I've been so intellectually unchallenged lately by my show that my mind had to create a dream that defies interpretation just to give me a challenge? "
"Martin: I don't know. Keep talking, you're making me sleepy. "
"Frasier: Dad, no... that's got to be it My show hasn't provided me with a single patient worthy of my skills and I had to invent one myself - me Oh, God What a relief. At last, finally, to bed. Dad, you've witnessed an epiphany "
"Martin: Yeah, God, I got to get you to put this on tape. "
"Frasier: Off we go. To sleep, perchance NOT to dream. "
"TO: "
"Freud: Dr. Crane, Dr. Siegmund Freud. "
"Frasier: Oh, my goodness It's quite an honor "
"Freud: The honor is all mine. I gave you a complex psychological problem and you solved it. You are a brilliant psychiatrist. "
"Frasier: Oh, that's very flattering. You know, there are so many things I'd like to ask you "
"Freud: In good time, my boy. In good time. Right now, we have more important matters. "
"TO: an exterior shot of Frasier's apartment building, where we see "

"Niles: Is it me or is the foam a tad dense today? "
"Frasier: Like a dreary fog on a Scottish moor. "
"Niles: Rather than accent it overwhelms. Rather than flirt it assaults. "
"Martin: Rather than watching the ballgame I have to listen to this. "
"Roz: Hey, you guys. "
"All: Hey, Roz. "
"Roz: Frasier, don’t forget your staff meeting tomorrow. It starts at... "
"Frasier: Well, I certainly hope his tailor can fix the two holes you’ve just burned in his jacket "
"Roz: They’re not in his jacket It starts tomorrow at ten. Hey, Marty. What are you doing here? "
"Martin: They’re dragging me out to buy some new clothes. "
"Niles: We’re taking him out to Rodolfo’s once-a-year sale. It’s fifty per cent off. Alterations are free. "
"Martin: Big deal. 'Bud’s Clothing' do that every day. "
"Frasier: Yes, not to mention the convenience of getting your 'BigFoot' pizza right next door. "
"Martin: These guys think I have bad taste in clothes. "
"Roz: Well, I like the way you dress. "
"Niles: I believe that’s what’s called 'the clincher.' Shall we go? "
"Martin: All right. Well I’ll just hit the head and we can get it over with. "
"Niles: Dad, you could show a little more enthusiasm. "
"Martin: OK. Gee, I can’t wait to hit the head and we can get it all over with. "
"Niles: Are you quite finished undressing him with your eyes? "
"Roz: Oh, please. I’m already looking for my stockings and trying to remember where I parked my car. "
"Frasier: You know Roz, I would have thought that the gentleman over there with the flannel shirt would have been more your type. "
"Roz: Him? Not a chance. See the way he’s slurping his orange juice? Sloppy kisser You can tell right away the guy’s no good I bed. So cautious. Look at the way he’s blowing on his coffee. "
"Niles: I wasn’t trying to cool it. I was simply blowing a foam hole. "
"Roz: You don’t even wrinkle the sheets, do you? "
"Frasier: Niles, that man across the street at the newsstand. Is that who I think it is? "
"Niles: He does look familiar. "
"Frasier: It’s T.H. Houghton "
"Niles: No "
"Frasier: Just think back to the picture on the dust cover of 'Time Flies Tomorrow.' A little older, greyer. "
"Roz: 'Time Flies Tomorrow' – I read that in high school. What else did he write? "
"Frasier: Nothing. That’s the crux of his entire legend. The man published one masterpiece and in the thirty years since he’s become a virtual recluse. "
"Niles: Oh my God. It is T.H. Houghton. We’re a stone’s throw away from one of the giants of American literature. "
"Roz: Not the way you throw "
"Frasier: Niles, this is incredible. The man’s entire life is shrouded in mystery and there he is. "
"Niles: I’ve always idolised him. What I wouldn’t give to meet that man. "
"Roz: Well why don’t you go over and introduce yourself? "
"Niles: I can’t just walk up to a God like that. "
"Roz: Well find a subtler way. "
"Niles: In your vernacular that would be what? To slingshot your panties across the street? "
"Roz: Foam Blower "
"Frasier: Niles, she happens to be right. How often do we get an opportunity like this? Come on. Let’s go. "
"Niles: All right. "
"Frasier: Dad, come on. We’re going. "
"Martin: Why, what’s the rush? "
"Niles: T.H. Houghton is across the street. "
"Martin: Who? "
"Frasier: Come on. Let’s go. "
"Martin: Hey Guy with a cane here "
"Frasier: Niles, I thought you said you saw Houghton come in here. "
"Niles: Well, I’m sorry if my tracking skills aren’t up to your standard. Perhaps instead of asking for a baby brother you should have asked for a German shorthaired Pointer. "
"Frasier: I did Well, I’m sorry. "
"Niles: He must still be out on the street. Let’s go. "
"Martin: I’m parking it here. They’ve got the Mariners game on. "
"Frasier: Dad, Dad. Please. We can’t waste time. "
"Niles: Oh let him be. He’s dead weight. "
"Frasier: Right. "
"Houghton: What’s the score? "
"Martin: Four to three, Mariners. "
"Both: Awww "
"Martin: I mean, that’s the cut-off man "
"Houghton: Can you believe that man makes seven million a year? "
"Martin: That’s crazy. See him scratching his butt? That’s about five grand a year right there "
"Houghton: Let me have a Ballantine. "
"Martin: Yeah, make it two. "
"Houghton: So that’s your favourite character, really? "
"Martin: Yeah, I really like him. He’s the kind of guy you can just sit and have a beer with. "
"Houghton: Well, I can see you saying that about 'Hoss.' But Little Joe? "
"Martin: Well that’s the great thing about 'Bonanza.' There’s something for everyone. "
"Frasier: Well thank you, Mr. False Alarm. Oh, look. There he is over at the yoghurt store. Oh look. There he is at the futon store. Oh look. There he is with Dad. "
"Niles: And now he’s leaving. I must tell him what an impact his book has made on my life. "
"Frasier: Aren’t you afraid it will sound just a bit unoriginal? "
"Niles: Why? "
"Frasier: Because I’m going to say it first. "
"Patron: Excuse me, Mr. Houghton? "
"Houghton: Yeah. "
"Patron: I just wanted to tell you that... "
"Houghton: My book changed your life. Swell. "
"Patron: No, no. "
"Houghton: It changed mine too. Look, I’m sorry, I don’t like to discuss my work. "
"Patron: Well, that was humiliating. I’ve never felt so rejected in my life. "
"Frasier: Now, now. Don’t take it so hard. Who was to know you’d be so sensitive? "
"Patron: Hey, aren’t you Dr. Frasier Crane? "
"Frasier: Not now, I don’t have the time. I’m sorry. Dad, do you realise who you were just talking to? That was T.H. Houghton. "
"Martin: Yeah, I know. "
"Niles: Well, what did you two talk about? "
"Martin: Oh, I don’t know. This and that. "
"Frasier: Dad, virtually nothing is known about this man. Can’t you give us something specific? "
"Martin: It was just guy stuff, you know? Baseball, TV shows, old war stories. "
"Frasier: He told war stories? "
"Martin: No, I did. I told him about the time I made the stew and the platoon got sick. "
"Frasier: How could you? "
"Martin: He liked it. He’s a nice guy. I think maybe I’ll buy one of his books. "
"Frasier: Not books, Dad. Book. Book. He wrote one book and then never wrote again. "
"Niles: Well, if only we’d arrived ten minutes earlier. We could have been talking to him. Could have that explored that mammoth intellect. "
"Frasier: Can you imagine the torture the man’s endured to peak at such an early age? "
"Niles: Oh my God, Frasier. Look. It’s a doodle. "
"Frasier: Not just any doodle. It’s a Houghton doodle. It’s mine. "
"Niles: It’s mine. "
"Martin: It’s mine. "
"Frasier: Dad, what do you care? "
"Martin: I mean I drew it. "
"Frasier: Well that’s very touching. Here Niles, this is for you. "
"Niles: I don’t know when I’ve enjoyed an exhibit more. The artist’s choice to make that still-life a monochrome was a stroke of genius. Conveyed such despair. "
"Frasier: Yes. It was so refreshing to see a sad peach. "
"Niles: How about that curator? "
"Frasier: Kind of a peach herself, wasn’t she? "
"Niles: No cubism there, I don’t think. "
"Martin: Hey, boys. "
"Both: Hi, Dad. [both notice that T.H. Houghton is getting on the elevator with Martin and are momentarily lost for words.] "
"Martin: Oh Ted, I’d like you to meet my sons. This is Frasier and Niles. They’re big fans of yours. "
"Houghton: Hi, guys. "
"Frasier: Mr Houghton... er... we... "
"Niles: Words can’t express... "
"Houghton: I guess not. Nice meeting you folks. [the elevator door closes] "
"Niles: We missed them again. [presses the lift button and the doors open] "
"Martin: What’s going on? "
"Niles: That’s odd. So where are you two going? "
"Martin: Well, Ted’s taking me out to this Bratwurst place he knows. "
"Frasier: Bratwurst. Yummee. My God, that’s our favourite. "
"Houghton: Nice meeting you. "
"Houghton: What’s wrong with this thing? "
"Niles: Could be broken. Well maybe if you came into the apartment we could call down to the front desk... "
"Martin: NO I’m sure it’ll work this time "
"Frasier: What the hell was he doing here? "
"Niles: We might know if you hadn’t spent an hour pondering the despair of the peach. "
"Frasier: This from the man who spent thirty minutes looking at 'Woman with a rectangular head.' "
"Daphne: Oh, was Mrs. Foster in the lobby again? "
"Frasier: No, Daphne. Could you explain to me just how T.H. Houghton ended up in my apartment? "
"Daphne: Well, he’s only in town for a couple of days. He doesn’t know too many people so he looked your father up, gave him a ring and Mr. Crane invited him over to watch the Mariners game. "
"Frasier: He was here all afternoon? "
"Daphne: Yes. It’s a shame you couldn’t be here. He told the most fascinating stories. Of course he and your father are getting on like old chums, but the sweetest thing was how he took to Eddie. "
"Frasier: He spent time with Eddie? "
"Daphne: Fed him his afternoon biscuit. "
"Frasier: Will the madness ever end? "
"Niles: Now, now, let’s not give up hope. Maybe Dad will bring him back to the apartment after dinner. "
"Frasier: Oh, well I doubt it. He’ll probably run into J.D. Salinger and Salman Rushdie – go out for Margaritas. You know, Niles, these near misses are just excruciating. "
"Daphne: There you go, Mr. Houghton. You’re welcome. "
"Frasier: Was that him? "
"Daphne: Yes. He forgot his coat. "
"Frasier: Hold the elevator "
"Niles: We missed him again. "
"Frasier: Don’t you dare gloat, you miserable little biscuit whore "
"QUESTION: HOW DID BABE RUTH CHANGE MUSICAL THEATER HISTORY? "
"Frasier: Afternoon, Daphne. "
"Daphne: Hello. Good dog Oh, Dr. Crane. It’s a good thing you’re home. Mr. Houghton is dropping by to pick your father up for the Mariners game. "
"Frasier: You serious? He’s coming back? "
"Daphne: Yes. Any minute. It’s a double header. [Frasier looks blankly at her] They play two games "
"Frasier: Oh right, right. This is incredibly good fortune. I finally get to spend some time alone with the man, even if just for a few minutes. "
"Frasier: Daphne, be a dear and stall Dad, will you? If he gives you any trouble just hide his cane. "
"Frasier: Niles What fortuitous timing. Er... you know the wine shop just called a moment ago? It seems they’re down to their last two cases of the ’82 Chambolle-Musigny, so why don’t you dash right down there and stack it all up? "
"Niles: Okay. Hold it You know very well that in 1982 there was a drought in Bourgogne. The locals dubbed it 'The Year of the Raisin.' And that wine was never sold by the case, only by the bottle T.H. Houghton is here, isn’t he? "
"Frasier: No. "
"Niles: Fine. Then you won’t mind if I just hang around for a while. "
"Frasier: Oh, all right. He’s on his way. He and Dad are going to a baseball game. It’s a double header. [Niles looks blankly at him] They play two games "
"Martin: Hi, Niles. "
"Niles: Oh, Dad. So I hear that Mr. Houghton is on his way over. Maybe we could all have lunch before you head off. "
"Frasier: Oh, that’s a splendid idea. "
"Martin: Nah, game starts in 45 minutes. "
"Frasier: Well, then perhaps he could come by after the game for a drink. "
"Martin: Nah, sorry. That won’t work either. He’s got to go to his publisher’s. Drop off his new book. "
"Frasier: Houghton has a new book? "
"Niles: I’ve lost the feeling in my legs "
"Frasier: Did he say anything about it? The characters? The setting? "
"Martin: No. He just said it was a book. "
"Niles: Dad You have to skip the game. It’s not just for our benefit. After all, it’s baseball. The man must be starved for intellectual stimulation. "
"Martin: Oh, I know what you’re saying – that someone like that would have to prefer spending time with you than some dumbbell like me. "
"Frasier: Dad – you’re not dumb. You miss the point entirely Look, let’s just say, for example, you came home one afternoon and I was sitting here discussing literature with... oh, I don’t know. Give me the name of a baseball player. "
"Martin: Darryl Strawberry. "
"Frasier: No, a real one "
"Martin: Frasier, the problem is, you push too hard. We just talk sports, have a few laughs. That’s all. I don’t ask him about his work – that’s probably why he told me about the book. "
"Frasier: Mr. Houghton. Hello. "
"Houghton: Hi. How you doing? "
"Martin: Hey, Ted. Come on in. "
"Frasier: So you two boys are off to the baseball game, huh? Double header. "
"Niles: That’s two games "
"Houghton: Yeah. "
"Niles: Little known fact about "
"baseball: the owner of the Boston Red Sox sold Babe Ruth to the New York Yankees to finance a Broadway musical, 'No No Nanette' "
"Houghton: You ready, Marty? "
"Martin: Let’s go. "
"Frasier: I really enjoyed chatting with you. Maybe you could drop back by after the game. We could pick up where we left off... "
"Frasier: No No Nanette "
"Niles: I’m sorry. There are exactly two things that I could possibly add to a baseball conversation. That, and... no, just the one. "
"Niles: Frasier. "
"Frasier: Yes. "
"Niles: Have you noticed how Houghton always carries a satchel with him wherever he goes? "
"Frasier: Well, actually as a matter of fact I have. "
"Niles: And didn’t Dad mention that Houghton was on his way to his publisher’s after the game with a new manuscript? "
"Frasier: Yes. "
"Niles: And would that be the very same satchel, which is now resting under my head? "
"Frasier: Oh my God "
"Frasier: Wait "
"Niles: Should we? "
"Frasier: We shouldn’t. "
"Niles: Could we live with ourselves if we did? "
"Frasier: Could we live with ourselves if we didn’t? "
"Niles: Could we live with ourselves either way? "
"Frasier: Oh, stop it, Niles. Who are we kidding? "
"Frasier: 'The Chameleon's Song,' by T.H. Houghton. "
"Niles: These are hand-written corrections. Frasier – this is his original manuscript "
"Daphne: Shame on you Going through someone else’s personal property Well, it’s just plain wrong and I know your father wouldn’t approve. Of course I wouldn’t be here to tell him if I had the day off... "
"Frasier: Fine, go. "
"Daphne: Great Although having a day off is pretty meaningless when you have no money to, you know, maybe go to lunch or do some shopping, perhaps take in a show... [takes money off Frasier as she walks past and out the door] Oh, thanks "
"Frasier: All right, Niles. Shall we? "
"Niles: Not yet. The atmosphere has to be absolutely perfect. "
"Frasier: Good point. Let’s begin with the lighting. "
"Niles: Warmer. Warmer. [Frasier turns again] A little cooler. A touch warmer. A hair back. [Frasier gives up and goes over to the drinks cabinet whilst Niles, still concentrating on the lighting keeps on talking] No, no, a hair the other way. No, a touch warmer. Perfect. "
"Frasier: Good "
"Niles: Ooh excellent, excellent. What wine would most enhance the experience? "
"Frasier: No, Niles. Wine might dull our faculties. Perhaps instead a slow sipping cordial would be the proper garnish. "
"Niles: Sherry? "
"Frasier: Armagnac. "
"Niles: Oh, well see? That’s why you’re the older brother. "
"Frasier: Ooh "
"Niles: What is it? "
"Frasier: I don’t think you’re there yet. "
"Niles: Ooh "
"Frasier: Well... it’s a masterpiece. "
"Niles: Eddie I never thought I’d utter these words but it actually surpasses 'Time Flies Tomorrow.' "
"Frasier: Eddie, please I’m trying to savour the moment. "
"Niles: How was the game? "
"Houghton: Is that my manuscript? "
"Martin: What the hell’s going on? "
"Houghton: You went through my bag? That’s my personal property. "
"Martin: I don’t believe you two. "
"Frasier: Mr. Houghton, please. We are terribly, terribly sorry. "
"Niles: The temptation to read it was just too great. "
"Martin: What’s that supposed to mean? You’re grown men, both of you. At least I thought you were. You had no right to touch that. Ted, I’m sorry. I’m just so ashamed. "
"Houghton: Marty, it’s all right. "
"Martin: No, it’s not all right. "
"Houghton: No, no, it’s OK. Really. Somebody had to read it first. So what did you think? "
"Niles: Of the book? "
"Houghton: No, of my typing. Yes, of course of the book. "
"Niles: Well... s'great. "
"Frasier: Er... Wow "
"Houghton: Well, at least you liked it. I’m going to have to be running. "
"Martin: Are you sure? I was going to make some coffee. "
"Houghton: No, no. I got an appointment. Can I use the... "
"Martin: Right there. "
"Martin: Boy, I’ve had it with you guys. If you were 'Hoss' and Little Joe, Ben Cartwright would kick your sorry butts right off the Ponderosa. "
"Frasier: Dad. Dad, we’re sorry. "
"Niles: Very sorry. "
"Frasier: He’s back on the Cartwrights again. You know, some day we really should ask him just who the hell they are? You know, Niles, one thing just really bugs me. Houghton is going to leave here today thinking we’re just a couple of inarticulate simpletons. "
"Niles: What with those pithy comments we made about his masterpiece. Great. 'Wow.' "
"Frasier: We’ll go down in history with the same baboon who first read 'Hamlet' and told Shakespeare 'My goodness. What a parchment turn' "
"Niles: It’s not too late. He hasn’t left yet. "
"Frasier: Yes, yes. We could still say something to show him that we appreciated the full complexity of his work. "
"Frasier: Mr. Houghton, you know, there is one further thing I’d like to add about your book. "
"Houghton: Yeah? "
"Frasier: Well, it’s the way you modulated into the second person narrative during the flashback scene. Frankly, it beggars anything Faulkner attempted. "
"Houghton: Really? That’s very flattering. "
"Niles: Wait, I have one too. The way you so skilfully mirrored the structure of Dante’s 'Divine Comedy' was inspired. "
"Houghton: Really? "
"Frasier: Yes, yes. But the inferno of the bordello... "
"Niles: Which we noticed had exactly nine rooms "
"Frasier: Uh-huh. To the purgatory of the assembly line and finally to the paradise of the farm. "
"Houghton: You both saw that? "
"Niles: Oh, it practically jumped off the page. "
"Houghton: Well, that’s very perceptive of you. "
"Frasier: Well, thank you. Our turn to be flattered. "
"Houghton: You’re absolutely right. This whole book is crap "
"Niles: Beg your pardon? "
"Houghton: How could I be so blind? I lifted the entire structure from Dante. "
"Niles: Oh, you mean you weren’t going for that. "
"Houghton: Of course not. This confirms my worst fear. I have nothing original left to say. I’m an empty shell. I was a fool to think I had a second book in me. [reading from his manuscript] 'The winters were harsh on the farm.' Well, here’s something to warm them up. [starts throwing the pages into the fire] "
"Martin: What’s going on here? "
"Houghton: You’re both right. I’m a talentless hack who got lucky once. "
"Frasier: Dad, we didn’t say that. "
"Martin: You’re not listening to these two, are you? "
"Houghton: Look at this trash. It won’t even burn. "
"Frasier: Well, it’s a fireplace, you see. It’s not well ventilated. "
"Houghton: This book doesn’t belong in a fireplace. It belongs in the gutter with the rest of society’s garbage. "
"Houghton: I want to thank you two. If I had published that book my reputation would have been destroyed. At least now I’m left with a shred of dignity. "
"Martin: Happy? Hey, Ted. Wait up. "
"Frasier: Well, we’ve destroyed a man’s life. "
"Niles: Not to mention depriving future generations of a work of art. "
"Frasier: Well, you know on the other hand, had he actually published it the critics surely would have noticed that Dante parallel. "
"Niles: Hmm. If he felt bad hearing it from us, imagine how he would have felt reading it in the 'New York Review of Books.' "
"Frasier: Oh God, yes. With his fragile ego he would have been completely devastated. "
"Niles: Who knows what he might have done? "
"Frasier: You know, Niles... we saved that man’s life. "
"Niles: Yes, I think you’re right. On the other hand... "
"Frasier: Don’t go there "
"Niles: See, that’s why you’re the older brother. "

"Frasier: So I decided it was time I got to know some of my colleagues in the media. "
"Niles: But a convention? You've never shown any interest before. "
"Frasier: They've never held one in Aspen before "
"Niles: Just "
"think: hundreds of radio psychiatrists all in the same location. One well-timed avalanche and the dignity of the entire psychiatric profession would be restored. "
"Frasier: Oh, good one. I can always count on you for some witty retort. "
"Niles: Mmm... I insult you and you compliment me. Could the request for a favour be far behind? "
"Frasier: Damn, you are perceptive. "
"Niles: Oh, stop it. "
"Frasier: Oh, all right. Listen, Niles – I'd like you to do my show for me for the week I'm gone. "
"Niles: Me standing in for you? I'm sorry, Frasier. I couldn't presume to fill those big floppy red shoes of yours. "
"Frasier: Please. Please, Niles. Look, I'm begging you. The station wants to replace me with Helen Grogan, better known as Ma' Nature. She does a gardening show and I'm just a little worried that a week of discussing well-rotted manure will weaken my listener base. "
"Niles: It hasn't yet "
"Frasier: Very well. You leave me no alternative but to call in my marker. "
"Niles: What marker? "
"Frasier: Oh, I think you know. "
"Niles: You wouldn't. "
"Frasier: I would. "
"Niles: You can't "
"Frasier: I will. "
"Niles: That was three years ago. "
"Frasier: I don't recall there being any statute of limitations. I distinctly recall that when you asked me to go out with Maris's sister, you said that you would owe me one forever. "
"Niles: But you only spent one evening with Brie. That hardly compares with what you're asking me to endure. "
"Frasier: Oh? Shall I refresh your memory? Midway through the opera her ermine muff began to tremble. As it turned out she had used it to smuggle in her adorably incontinent Chihuahua. Just as I thought we'd reached the low point of the evening I suddenly felt a sandpaper tongue licking my earlobe. Alas it did not belong to little Hervé Fortunately my shriek coincided with the on-stage murder of Gondolfo Roz will expect you on Monday at two. "
"Niles: For your information Brie had a very tough road-a-ho growing up. It's not easy going through life with one nostril. "
"Frasier: Did I mention she had a cold that night? "
"Niles: Monday at two it is. "
"Linda: And now we're at the point where all communication has broken down. He won't even listen to me. "
"Niles: Linda- "
"Linda: Do you know how annoying that is – not to be listened to? "
"Niles: Linda- "
"Linda: It's driving me crazy. I was hoping maybe you would speak to him directly. "
"Niles: Excuse me one moment. Thank you for the brilliant job of call screening, Roz. How do I get out of this? "
"Roz: Did you ever think of saying you've other callers on the line? "
"Niles: Linda, I'd love to go into this in more depth but unfortunately we're nearly out of time and Roz has lots of other callers waiting anxiously on the line. "
"Roz: Actually, Dr. Crane, all lines are open "
"Linda: So you can talk to him? Good. I'm putting him on the line right now. Go ahead "
"Niles: All right. Murray – you're dealing with your problem in a very self-destructive manner. It won't be solved by refusing to eat. Do you hear me? "
"Linda: Oh my God, it's working. He's eating Dr. Crane, what did you say to him? "
"Niles: Well I'd like to tell you but that would violate Doctor-Cat confidentiality [Roz signals that the show is about to finish] Oh, well Seattle, I'm afraid we're out of time. This is Dr. Niles Crane. One down, four to go. See you tomorrow That little bit of sabotage was not amusing. "
"Roz: Then why did coffee come out my nose? "
"Bulldog: Hey, Dr. Doolittle. I heard your show. It didn't suck "
"Niles: Ah. 'Dear diary...' "
"Bulldog: So how's it feel? "
"Niles: Like I'm walking away from my lamppost and counting the bills in my garter belt "
"Bulldog: OK. Both of you get out of here. I gotta set up for my show. I got Reggie McLemore on my show today. Don't ask me why. "
"Niles: I wasn't even going to ask who. "
"Roz: He's a guard for the Sonics. "
"Bulldog: He used to be unstoppable - 20 points a game easy. Now he's in the 'tank.' Just what I need on my show – a loser. "
"Bulldog: Oh look – there he is now. What an overpaid, worthless piece of... HEY, REGGIE MY MAN "
"Reggie: You never call me unless you need tickets, man. What's up with that? "
"Bulldog: I love this guy. Reggie McLemore, Roz Doyle. "
"Roz: Hi, I'm a big fan of yours. "
"Reggie: Thanks. "
"Bulldog: I'd introduce you to this guy but he doesn't know squat about sports. "
"Niles: On the contrary – in prep school I was an ardent sportsman. Until an inflamed instep forced me to resign from the croquet club. "
"Niles: I'll see myself out. "
"Reggie: Wait a minute. You're the shrink. I heard you in my car on the way over. "
"Niles: Dr. Niles Crane. It's a pleasure. "
"Reggie: Hey Doc, wait. You sounded like you really knew what you were talking about. There's this little problem I've been having and I was wondering if maybe you could help me out? "
"Niles: What is it? "
"Reggie: See, for the last two weeks, every time I get my hands on the pill I choke. "
"Niles: Well, have you tried mashing it with a spoon? "
"Reggie: You don't watch much basketball, do you? It's my game, man. Because of me we've lost six in a row. "
"Niles: Oh. Well, I'm not very well-versed in sports psychology, but I could certainly schedule a session. "
"Reggie: No, no. I need something fast. We got Phoenix tonight. "
"Niles: This is highly irregular, but since you're pressed there are some exercises I can suggest. "
"Reggie: Oh, great. Thanks, man. Just name it – tickets to any game you want. "
"Niles: There's nothing wrong with your sense of humour. Have a seat. "
"Niles: We'll start with a positive visualisation. I want you to close your eyes. Take a deep breath. Good. I want you to imagine yourself on the playing surface doing whatever it is you actually do. Tell me what you see. "
"Reggie: OK. Kemp's passing me the ball. I'm bringing it up court. I'm dribbling. "
"Niles: Don't worry about your appearance. Start again. I'll just be quiet. "
"Roz: Can I ask you a favour? "
"Bulldog: Yeah, forget it. He's married "
"Roz: Hey That's pretty offensive. Why did you assume that's what I wanted? "
"Bulldog: OK, then. What did you want? "
"Roz: Well, I don't know. I just wondered if... "
"Bulldog: Time's up. Oh, by the way, if you're so hungry for some good-looking athletic guy, why won't you go out with me? "
"Roz: If you're not at least this tall you can't go on this ride. "
"Niles: This next exercise is designed to block negative feelings. I've tried it myself. Simply take a moment. Think of something comforting from "
"childhood: a stuffed animal, a dog- eared copy of Middlemarch. [again Reggie looks baffled at Niles] You may have other memories "
"Bulldog: Come on, Reggie. Ticket "
"Reggie: I gotta run. Thanks a lot, Doc – I'll give it a try. "
"Niles: Oh, wait. I saw this. It has steps "
"Reggie: Later, man. "
"TO: "
"Daphne: You know, according to this article... "
"Martin: No, quiet [Daphne looks angry while Martin remonstrates with the television] That's 3 seconds. Come on. He's camping out in the middle. No, don't double the ball – they'll just sling it around for a three. There it is – just like I said Ohhhh Oh, time out – sure, now you listen to me. Can you believe this? Two minutes ago we were up six points, now... "
"Daphne: Quiet – this is my favourite commercial No, don't pick that floor cleaner. It'll give your floors waxy build-up No, don't do it. DON'T DO IT D'ohhh "
"Martin: It's completely different. "
"Daphne: That'll be Dr. Crane. It'll be a pleasure to be around one man who's not obsessed with sports. "
"Niles: Hello, Daphne. Ooh, the Sonics are on Excuse me. "
"Niles: So, Dad... "
"Martin: Hold it, Niles – there's only nine seconds to go. "
"Niles: What's the score? "
"Martin: What do you care? Get it to McLemore. To McLemore – he's got the hot hand. Yes. Come on, Reggie... UNBELIEVABLE SONICS WIN [claps his hands in delight] "
"Niles: Oh, this is fantastic, Dad. Do you know...? "
"Martin: Shush, Niles. I want to see the replay. Get it to McLemore. UNBELIEVABLE "
"Niles: You know, Dad, you might be interested to know... "
"Martin: Quiet, Niles – I want to see the interview. "
"Sportscaster: Reggie – got a minute? Great game tonight. Seems like your slump is over. "
"Reggie: Yeah, I was really feeling it out there tonight. "
"Sportscaster: What turned it around for you? "
"Reggie: Well, I was having a little problem getting my head together, but this radio shrink really helped me out. Dr. Niles Crane... "
"Sportscaster: Well, good luck against Utah. "
"Reggie: Thanks a lot. "
"Sportscaster: Let's head it back upstairs. "
"Martin: You? "
"Niles: Is that so hard to believe? "
"Martin: Yeah "
"Daphne: When did you talk to him? "
"Niles: He was on Bulldog's show today. We had a brief session in the hallway – not more than two minutes. "
"Martin: You turned Reggie's game around in only two minutes? "
"Niles: You could be a little less surprised. I am a skilled psychiatrist. During sixteen years in the field I have developed certain instincts. "
"Martin: I gotta say – I'm impressed. "
"Daphne: Yes. I'm starting to think I should spend an hour or two on the couch with you. "
"Martin: Are you kidding? With Niles, it'd only take two minutes "
"Niles: Thanks, Dad "
"TO: "
": Hey Doc – great job Go Sonics "
": You the man "
"Niles: Thank you. Er... same to you. "
"Niles: Heavens. I need a clip and a buff. "
"Roz: There he is – the toast of Seattle. I suppose you knew you'd made the sports section of the paper this morning? "
"Niles: Yes, I'd heard. I must admit I find this all a bit mystifying. Do people really care this much about a basketball game? "
"Roz: Are you kidding? This is Seattle. It rains nine months out of the year. We take our indoor sports very seriously. "
"Niles: Well, I know you always have "
"Roz: You're a hero today so I'm going to let that one go. "
"Bulldog: Pucker up, baby – I'm planting a big wet one on ya [grabs Niles’ head and kisses him on the forehead.] "
"Niles: Well, there's a layer of skin I'll be exfoliating this evening. "
"Bulldog: I had 200 bucks on the Sonics "
"Niles: Isn't gambling illegal? "
"Bulldog: Isn't he the cutest? "
"Roz: Oh, yeah. "
"Bulldog: OK. I hope you don't feel this way about chicks 'cause I got one of the Sonics' cheerleaders coming on my show today and she really wants to see you. "
"Roz: Believe it or not, Bulldog, not every man's dream woman is a pom-pom-shaking half-time half-wit. "
"Niles: Is she the head cheerleader? "
"Bulldog: Yeah. And she's coming in costume. "
"Roz: Of course she is – it's radio [pushes Bulldog out the booth before turning to Niles with a stack of papers] Look at these faxes that came for you. "
"Niles: Faxes? 'Seattle thanks you.' 'You're the Sonics MVP.' "
"Roz: Most Valuable Player. "
"Niles: Oh 'You're a genius.' With the less common J spelling but still, his point is well taken. "
"Roz: I bet you're feeling pretty good about yourself? "
"Niles: Suddenly I'm being revered as a god by the same troglodytes who, in junior high school, tried to pack me into my own briefcase. It's glorious. "
"Roz: Oh, I almost forgot the best part. Reggie sent these tickets for tonight's game over. "
"Niles: Oh. Well, I suppose I can't disappoint my new fans. Tell me, does one still wear a white sweater jauntily tied around the neck to these things? "
"Roz: If one wants to get the crap beaten out of one "
"Martin: Hey. "
"Niles: Dad. What a surprise. "
"Martin: I'm not interrupting you or anything, am I? "
"Niles: No, no. Come on in. Is everything alright? "
"Martin: Oh sure, sure. I was just having lunch at McGinty's and some of the guys would really like to meet you and I was hoping that maybe after your show you'd stop in there for a drink. I mean, I wouldn't ask you but some of these guys are my best buddies. "
"Niles: Well actually Dad, Reggie just sent over these tickets to tonight's game. I was going to ask you to go, but since... "
"Martin: To hell with those guys, I'm there "
"Niles: I have to tell you I'm finding all this attention a bit overwhelming. "
"Martin: Oh come on – you deserve it. You're a hero. "
"Niles: Perhaps it's time we put all this in perspective. The only real heroes are the fine athletes who worked so hard for two hours to win that game. My contribution was minimal at best. "
"Bulldog: What did I tell ya, Doc? "
"Cheerleader: Which one of you won the game for us last night? "
"Niles: That would be me "
"Martin: Nice seeing you too. "
"Niles: Dad, it really isn't necessary to tell everyone we bump into that I'm the one Reggie credited with last night's victory "
"Spectator: That was you? "
"Martin: Yeah, yeah. That's my son Niles Crane. "
"Niles: [sitting down on the baseline seats, unaware of their importance] They must have sold too many tickets. They've stuck us in these folding chairs. "
"Martin: Wow. Right on the hardwood, five feet from the baseline. "
"Daphne: It's like front row orchestra, stage right. "
"Niles: Ooh. "
"Martin: Man, we're so close we're gonna get our teeth rattled when they center-pick. "
"Daphne: It's like sitting close enough to get hit by Placido Domingo's spit. "
"Reggie: Hey, N.C. – you made it. "
"Niles: I beg your pardon? Oh, 'N.C.' I thought you said Nancy. For a second it was prep school all over again. Let me introduce - Reggie McLemore, Daphne Moon, and this... "
"Martin: Marty Crane, Niles's Dad. I'm a big fan. I want you to know I never lost faith in you. Not when you were in your slump. Not when you tanked it in the playoffs. Not even when all my friends were calling you 'Reggie HacLemore' "
"Reggie: What? "
"Niles: This might be a good time to try that negative thought- blocking exercise. "
"Reggie: Yeah, OK. You guys enjoy the game. I'll see you afterwards. "
"Niles: What the hell was that? "
"Martin: That's the end of the shooter round. The coach is about to send the starting five in for the tip-off. "
"Daphne: The stage manager just called places. "
"Niles: Ooh. "
"Niles: I gather Reggie's not performing up to par this evening? "
"Spectator: You got that from all the booing, huh? Nice counselling, Doc – he's been throwing up bricks all night "
"Niles: Judging from that empty tureen of nachos and cheese you may be joining him. "
"Reggie: Doc, Doc, you gotta help me out here. I don't know what's wrong. "
"Niles: Perhaps you've forgotten some of my advice. Let's review quickly. Did you empty your mind of negative thoughts? "
"Reggie: Yeah. "
"Niles: What about the imaging exercises? "
"Reggie: Yeah, yeah, I did all that. What else did you tell me to do? "
"Niles: Nothing. Bulldog called you, you ran back in. "
"Reggie: No, no, wait. Right before that I rubbed your head. I remember 'cause my hand smelled like peach and I thought, 'What the hell does this guy wash his hair with?' "
"Niles: Well, you can't possibly think that my head is some sort of lucky charm? "
"Reggie: We'll know in a minute. "
"Martin: Hey, I saw you talking to Reggie again. I hope you gave him some more advice. "
"Niles: I tried to but he has this absurd idea that... "
"Martin: No, no, wait. "
"Announcer: McLemore shoots three. "
"Martin: Unbelievable. What did you say to him? "
"Niles: I didn't say anything that he could possibly... "
"Daphne: Look, look. He's stolen the ball. "
"Announcer: McLemore. Three more. "
"Daphne: Oh, Dr. Crane, you're a miracle worker. What did you say to him? "
"Niles: Oh, just something off the top of my head "
"Daphne: Ooh, isn't this nice? Dr. Crane sent us a postcard from Aspen. "
"Martin: Great. How's he doing? "
"Daphne: Let's see. 'I delivered a speech at the conference last night. I was especially pleased with my opening "
"line: 'My fellow psychiatrists, as I watched you on the slopes today I realised I had never seen so many Freudians slip'' "
"Daphne: 'As hard as you're laughing now, imagine the thunder of an auditorium of colleagues. Well, see you Saturday, Frasier.' Well, I'd better get going. I'm meeting Joe at the movies. Oh, bloody hell – it's later than I thought. "
"Martin: Enjoy. "
"Daphne: Yeah. Enjoy your game. "
"Daphne: Dr. Crane. Have fun at the game. "
"Niles: I'm afraid we won't be going. "
"Daphne: Ah. That's too bad. "
"Niles: Want to know why? "
"Daphne: Not really. "
"Martin: VIP parking. Uh-huh. That's courtside, pal. Right on the hardwood, I swear to God. And Reggie said the seats are ours for the rest of the season. I believe it's what they call 'living large'... I don't know, somewhere on TV. Yeah, OK. I gotta go. Bye Let's go, Niles. "
"Niles: You know, Dad, I was thinking. Maybe we shouldn't go to the game today. "
"Martin: You know what I was thinking? Maybe we shouldn't go to any of them. You know, that's one of the best things about this whole thing. When was the last time you and I joked like this? Well, we'd better get going, 'cause it's late. "
"Niles: Last night at the game, did you happen to notice when Reggie tousled my hair? "
"Martin: Yeah, yeah. Let's go. "
"Niles: Somehow, someway, he's convinced himself that that's what he needs to do in order to play well. "
"Martin: Oh. Well, can we talk about it in the car? "
"Niles: It has nothing to do with any advice I've given. It's all some sort of bizarre superstition and Reggie wants to rub my head again before today's game. "
"Martin: Well, you know, a lot of athletes have weird superstitions. "
"Niles: Yes, but I'm a psychiatrist. I can't let people think I'm treating the man when all I am is a rabbit's foot I'd be taking credit for something I don't deserve. "
"Martin: OK. What would you be taking credit for? Helping him. What are you doing? Helping him. I'm getting my coat. "
"Niles: But I wouldn't be helping him as a psychiatrist. "
"Martin: Oh, that's what's bugging you? People thinking you're a good psychiatrist? "
"Niles: Exactly "
"Martin: Are you a good psychiatrist? "
"Niles: Yes "
"Martin: I'm getting my coat. "
"Niles: Dad, Dad, I'm sorry. We're not going. "
"Martin: Aw, man, I knew you'd find some way to ruin this [throws his jacket to the floor] "
"Niles: Dad- "
"Martin: Courtside season tickets; VIP parking. "
"Niles: Dad- "
"Martin: No. Hell, you've got to have your reasons. 'It's my ethics. It's my integrity. It's my allergies.' Well, that's it. I'm never getting my hopes up again. "
"Niles: Dad, you can still watch the game on TV. "
"Martin: I don't want to watch it on TV "
"Niles: I'll get you a beer. "
"Martin: I don't like beer "
"Niles: Dad, you know I'm right. "
"Martin: Will you look me in the eye and answer me one "
"question: would you still be doing this if these were courtside seats at the opera? "
"Niles: Yes. My ethics are ethics. And by the way – where do you think I got those ethics? "
"Martin: Oh, yeah. Throw it back at me. That's real mature "
"Niles: I'd like to talk to Mr. McLemore. "
"Guard: Who wants to see him? "
"Niles: Tell him N.C. is here. "
"Guard: Nancy? "
"Niles: No. N-C. [the guard disappears into the locker room] What is so hard about that? "
"Reggie: Damn man, where have you been? I've got to be on court in five minutes. "
"Niles: Stop Before you rub your hands all over me, we need to talk. "
"Reggie: What's up? "
"Niles: I'll come right to the point. This entire affair has grown out of control. I need to end it. "
"Reggie: What are you saying? You're not coming down here any more? "
"Niles: Well, no. We can still see each other to talk, but no touching. That part of our relationship is over. Does this concern you? "
"Guard: It's starting to "
"Reggie: Come on, dude. "
"Niles: No. Now listen. Do you really expect me to drop what I'm doing and race down here every day just so you can run your fingers over my head? "
"Reggie: Yeah. "
"Niles: Listen to me closely. You are a gifted athlete with tremendous skill. Marshal your talents. Concentrate. Focus. The key to your success is to trust your own God-given abilities. It has nothing to do with my head "
"Reggie: It must be your hair. "
"Niles: Will you stop it? You're obsessing "
"Reggie: Come on, man – just let me touch it? "
"Niles: No You have to look at this logically. I can't come down here for every game and I certainly can't go with you when the team is on tour. This is not a long-term solution. What you need is legitimate therapy. You want to start? Come inside – I'll give you a quick session. We can proceed from there. "
"Reggie: Yeah, you're right, Doc. What I need is a long-term solution. "
"Niles: Good. "
"Reggie: Yo Frank, let me see those scissors. [takes scissors out of his bag] Coming, Doc. "

"Frasier: Oh my God... breathtaking. "
"Niles: Well, don't be greedy Your turn was over forty seconds ago "
"Frasier: All right, all right, Niles, all right. It's the penthouse unit, fourth from the left. "
"Niles: Oh, mama "
"Martin: You two know that what you're doing isn't right, don't you? "
"Frasier: We're simply admiring a very rare Brancusi armchair, not a naked woman. "
"Martin: That's what I'm talking about. "
"Martin: Oh, hi, Daph. "
"Daphne: Evening. "
"Martin: You're home kind of early, aren't you? "
"Daphne: A bit. Something... sort of happened. "
"Martin: Oh, yeah? What? "
"Daphne: Well, Joe and I were having dinner. Everything was nice as could be, and I said, 'Don't you like your potato?' And he said, 'No, I'm not hungry for potato just now.' So I said, 'Well, if you don't like your potato you're welcome to try my potato'— "
"Frasier: Daphne? Could we hasten to the post-potato portion of the dialogue? "
"Daphne: Well, that's when he said it. He said we'd been 'on-again, off-again' for too long without making anything permanent, so maybe it was best if we just broke up. "
"Martin: Oh, gosh, I'm sorry. You're sure taking it well. Boy, if you'd have told me Joe would end up dumping you tonight, I'd have been— "
"Daphne: Oh, God. He dumped me "
"Martin: Somebody comfort her "
"Niles: Right "
"Daphne: Oh, this is so embarrassing. "
"Frasier: Oh, no, no, never mind about that. Expressing our emotions is always beneficial, even if it does come at the expense of our pride and a very expensive brand-new Italian silk jacket. "
"Frasier: You know, I don't seem to be doing much good here. Why don't one of you give it a try? "
"Niles: Very well. "
"Martin: Now, Daphne, it's all right. You're better off without him. That guy was a bum. "
"Daphne: He was the best thing in my life "
"Martin: Oh. Well, maybe you two weren't meant for each other, you know? I mean, you're a champagne-and-caviar sort of gal, he's a meat-and-potatoes guy. "
"Daphne: Potatoes "
"Martin: I'm messing up, too. "
"Niles: I've got it, Dad. "
"Daphne: I'll get it "
"Roz: Hey, Daphne "
"Daphne: Roz... "
"Roz: Oh my God, you got dumped [hugs her; over her shoulder, to Frasier] Did you make her answer the door? "
"Frasier: It's what she does "
"Roz: Oh, it's all right, come on. "
"Daphne: I'm sorry about this. I guess I'm still at the point where I can't hear his name without crying. "
"Niles: You hear that, everyone? No one mention the name 'Joe' "
"Frasier: Brandy, Niles? "
"Niles: Uh, yes. Thank you. Frasier? I've just made an important decision. I'm going to tell Daphne how I feel about her. "
"Frasier: What? "
"Niles: I'm going to tell her tonight. "
"Frasier: You're serious about this? "
"Niles: I'm dead serious. Maris and I are nowhere near reconciling. I know this is the right decision, because I'm completely calm about it. Look. "
"Niles: Perhaps I'll take that brandy. "
"Frasier: Niles, before you do anything this rash, you should consider it first from all angles. "
"Niles: I've spent three years considering Daphne from all angles. "
"Frasier: I'm just not sure this is the right moment for this. "
"Niles: No, no, if you're trying to rattle me it's not going to work. I've been rehearsing this for months. 'Daphne, there's something I need to talk to you about. It's a matter of... Daphne, for a long time now, uh... you and I, we' — exactly how's the brandy getting here, by St. Bernard? "
"Frasier: Niles, I just think that you should consider Daphne's state of mind. She's still reeling from her breakup with Joe. Listen, why don't you give it one more day? "
"Niles: A day? "
"Frasier: A day. Just one day, please You've waited this long, another day won't make a difference. "
"Niles: All right. "
"Roz: Now, Daphne, if the jewelry wasn't that good and the sex wasn't that good, what have you really lost here? "
"Frasier: Dr. Roz wades in with the 'Gabor approach' to therapy "
"Roz: I am taking Daphne out and getting her mind off her troubles. Here's your tape. "
"Frasier: Oh, thank you, Roz. "
"Daphne: I want to thank you both for being so supportive. "
"Frasier: Oh, Daphne, nonsense. You know, after three years, you're really a member of the family. "
"Daphne: I'll get it. "
"Frasier: It's what she does "
"Martin: What are the Sonics thinking last night? If you're two for fifteen from behind the arc, why do you still give it to your two-guard instead of jamming it down to your big man in the paint? "
"Frasier: Eddie, I believe that question was directed at you. "
"Martin: You know, if you took an interest in sports, I bet you'd end up enjoying it. It's got drama, it's got graceful stuff... "
"Frasier: Thank you, Dad, but frankly I'm quite satisfied with the likes of Pavorotti's Pagliacci. You have your big man in the paint, I have mine. "
"Frasier: Niles. "
"Niles: Frasier. "
"Frasier: Either your boutonniere is way over the top, or you're here to execute last night's plan. "
"Niles: Look, I know I don't have your total support in this, but... how shall I put this? "
"Frasier: You don't care? "
"Niles: If you could work the phrase 'rat's ass' into there, you'd have it. The fact is, I'm tired of being lonely, and it makes no sense going on being lonely when the woman I long for is unattached. "
"Frasier: Yes, well, as I said to you at the time you tried to jump out of the tree house with an umbrella, 'I suppose you know what you're doing.' "
"Martin: Hey, Niles. "
"Niles: Hey, Dad. "
"Frasier: Hello? Oh, just a second, please. Dad, is Daphne in her room? "
"Martin: Gee, I don't know. DAPHNE HEY, DAPH DAPHNE "
"Frasier: For God's sake, I can yell Would you hold, please? "
"Martin: I've been waiting thirty years to do that. "
"Niles: You're probably wondering what I'm doing with these flowers. "
"Martin: Well, now that you mention it— "
"Niles: Well, I'll tell you. They're for Daphne. I'm going to tell her how I feel about her. "
"Martin: Oh, that's great, Niles. "
"Niles: 'That's great?' "
"Martin: Well, yeah. You're single now. She's single. What's the problem? "
"Niles: That's so funny. "
"Martin: What is? "
"Niles: That's just not the reaction I expected. I thought you'd say something more Dad-like, like... "
"Martin: You're out of your mind? "
"Niles: Yes. "
"Martin: She's never gonna go for it in a million years? "
"Niles: Stop it "
"Martin: Someday you're gonna look back on this as the stupidest, most idiotic— "
"Niles: I said stop it, Dad. "
"Daphne: Morning, Dr. Crane. "
"Niles: Hello, Daphne. "
"Daphne: Oh, don't you look nice. Hello? Yes, Rodney, I'm so glad you called Yes, I enjoyed meeting you too. Oh, well, yes, that would be lovely. I'll see you around four, then. Bye. "
"Frasier: Rodney? "
"Daphne: Yes, you won't believe this. Last night, Roz insisted on taking me to this bar she calls 'The Sure Thing.' "
"Frasier: How flattering. They've named a bar after her. "
"Daphne: She says that whenever she takes a friend there, they always end up meeting someone. Well, I wasn't there ten minutes when she spun my barstool around and I was face-to-face with this nice-looking man. "
"Martin: Rodney? "
"Daphne: Right I suppose it's a bit soon for me to be seeing anyone else. But, if I wait, he might not be available when I'm ready. "
"Niles: Timing is everything. "
"Daphne: I can't wait to tell Roz "
"Niles: 'Give it a day, Niles.' I believe that was your brilliant advice? "
"Frasier: I'm sorry, Niles, I really am. I don't know what to say. "
"Niles: Too bad you didn't have that problem last night. "
"Martin: Don't let it get you down. "
"Niles: I'm not going to. I still have a fallback position. [grabs Frasier's rolodex and starts flipping through it] I'm going to call Roz and have her take me to that bar tonight "
"Frasier: Niles, really — a singles bar? Please, you're not thinking clearly. That's not exactly your arena, is it? Listen, why don't you just give it a day and think it over... [off Niles's glare] Here, let me dial that for you. "
"TO: "
"Niles: Well, I'm here. I forgot to gargle, I'm wearing mismatched socks, and I'm so nervous I could wet myself. "
"Roz: Well, at least we have your opening line down. "
"Niles: You're going to have to be patient with me, Roz. This isn't exactly my milieu. "
"Roz: O.K., let's make that lesson number one. If you're going to use words like 'milieu,' you might as well show up here with a sore on your lip and a couple of kids. "
"Niles: Point well taken. "
"Roz: Will you sit down and relax? You're gonna be fine. There's just a few little rules you need to know. First, when you introduce yourself, be as casual as possible. Second, you cannot say enough nice things about her hair. I know that sounds shallow, but it really works. And third, hang on her every word — be fascinated. Now go. "
"Niles: What do you mean, 'go'? "
"Roz: It's time. "
"Niles: I'm not ready. "
"Roz: Oh, I've thrown a lot of little babies in the water and they've all come up swimming. Now go. "
"Niles: No, no, I couldn't possibly, not yet, I need to— "
"Niles: Hello. "
"Adelle: Hello. "
"Niles: Hope I'm not bothering you. "
"Adelle: No, not at all. I'm Adelle. "
"Niles: Niles. So, 'Adelle'... is that with one 'l' or two? "
"Adelle: Two. "
"Niles: Really? ' "
"Martin: You're wasting your time. "
"Frasier: No, I'm not. "
"Martin: You're not gonna win. "
"Frasier: It's time he learned what it's like to be stared at all the time. Bring it on, Buster, you got nothing. You can't touch me, I'm — Gaah It's like his eyes turned into sorcerer's pinwheels and started spinning "
"Martin: Just shake hands and say 'good fight.' "
"Martin: Oh, hi, Niles Come on in. "
"Niles: Dad, this is Adelle Childs — my father Martin. "
"Martin: Nice to meet you. "
"Niles: And this is my brother, Frasier. "
"Frasier: It's so nice to finally meet you. "
"Adelle: Nice to meet you. "
"Niles: Are you all right? Your eyes look funny. "
"Frasier: Oh, I'm fine, it's just — oh, here are your tickets. [gives them to Niles] "
"Niles: Thank you. "
"Frasier: Say, have you got time for a coffee before you go? "
"Adelle: That'd be nice. "
"Frasier: Splendid Gives me a chance to debut my Limoges coffee set — a series of six unique cups, each one representing a different wife of Henry VIII. My antique dealer just found an 'Anne of Cleves' to complete the set "
"Martin: He loves to rub it in. I'm still looking for a 'Wilma' to complete my juice glass set. "
"Niles: I'll lend you a hand. Excuse me. "
"Niles: So, what do you think? "
"Frasier: She seems very nice. "
"Niles: She's fabulous. I know it's only been three dates, but I feel as though I've been rescued. I no longer have to worry about becoming one of those pitiful losers embittered by a failed marriage, leading a lonely pathetic life of... fulfillment and good times "
"Frasier: Shouldn't you make a beeping noise when you back up like that? "
"Frasier: Well, coffee will be ready in a moment. "
"Adelle: So what were you two whispering about? "
"Niles: Oh, nothing — just how, whenever you think you have your life figured out, something unexpected happens. "
"Daphne: Sorry, forgot my keys. Hello, all. Oh, everyone, this is Rodney Banks. "
"Daphne: Dr. Niles Crane. "
"Niles: How do you do? "
"Rodney: The pleasure is mine. "
"Rodney: Flu season. "
"Niles: Can't be too careful. "
"Daphne: Oh, this is Dr. Frasier Crane, and his father Martin. And... "
"Niles: This is Adelle Childs. "
"Daphne: Hello. "
"Adelle: Hello. "
"Daphne: Well, we've just had the most wonderful day at the marina. "
"Martin: Oh, you get a boat? "
"Rodney: Actually, no. I have an inner-ear curvature that makes me prone to motion sickness. [Martin looks at Frasier, incredulous] But there's a charming bistro there that serves the most exquisite— "
"Niles: Not me. "
"Rodney: Not me. "
"Martin: Hello? Oh, I can't talk right now, Duke. I'm in the Twilight Zone. "
"Frasier: Would, uh, you like a coffee? "
"Daphne: Oh yes, that would be lovely. "
"Martin: I'll give you a hand, Frasier "
"in: "
"Martin: What the hell was that? "
"Frasier: I think maybe we should put a little red mark on the real Niles so we can tell them apart "
"Martin: Niles must be going nuts "
"Niles: Can I lend you a hand? "
"Martin: Oh no, that's fine, Niles. Oh, wait, wait a minute So, uh... what do you think of Rodney? "
"Niles: Well, so far I'm not impressed. Bit of a pretentious fop, wouldn't you say? "
"Martin: He doesn't, uh, remind you of anyone? "
"Niles: Remind me of anyone... "
"Rodney: So sorry, but about my coffee? I neglected to mention that I like my milk steamed, with just a dollop of foam, such as might give the impression of a cumulus cloud reflected in a still pond. "
"Niles: Consider it done. "
"Niles: I want to kill myself "
"Martin: Come on, Niles, it's funny "
"Niles: No It's not remotely funny Frasier talked me out of approaching Daphne on the same night she fell for that man "
"Frasier: You can't possibly be mad at me "
"Niles: No, no, Frasier, I'm grateful. Come here, let me show you how grateful I am "
"Martin: Niles, calm down "
"Daphne: Isn't Rodney just great? You know, I think it was the moment I broke up with Joe that I heard a voice saying, 'Daphne, it's time you went for a completely new type of man.' "
"Niles: You're a dead man "
"Frasier: Let's serve our guests their coffee "
"Frasier: Here we are, coffee. Milk's on its way, Niles is still steaming. "
"Rodney: Nothing smells quite so heavenly as a freshly brewed cup of coffee. Well, perhaps one thing does. "
"Daphne: Oh, stop that He just loves to smell my hair "
"Frasier: Anne Boleyn? "
"Niles: Catherine of Aragon. "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Oh, for heaven's sake, Niles. You don't take my calls, you ignore me. For God's sake, it's the behavior of a pouting adolescent. You put gum on my chair, didn't you? "
"Niles: Yep. "
"Frasier: Niles, "
"listen: I am terribly sorry if I steered you wrong. But just think about it. You do have a wonderful new woman in your life now, don't you? "
"Niles: Yes, I—I suppose I do. "
"Frasier: And Adelle does make you very happy, doesn't she? "
"Niles: Yes, she does. "
"Frasier: Well, then, if you've ever taken any of my advice before, take "
"this: Adelle may very well be the path to your happiness. "
"Frasier: But let's say I'm wrong... "
"Niles: But-but you're not wrong. Adelle is a wonderful, affectionate woman. "
"Niles: She's clearly drawn to a man of my type. "
"Frasier: Mmm. "
"Niles: Just thinking about her lifts my spirits. Frasier... thank you. "
"Frasier: Niles, uh... look. "
"Niles: I don't believe it The betrayal No one treats Daphne like that "
"Frasier: Niles Whatever you do, do not engage him in a physical fight. The whole thing would just look too weird "
"Niles: Hello, Adelle. "
"Adelle: Oh no. "
"Rodney: I know this may look a tad incriminating, but the truth is— "
"Niles: Oh, spare me, you ludicrous popinjay. I know exactly what's going on here, I saw the whole thing from my table. "
"Adelle: I was going to call you You see, Rodney and I... I'm sorry. "
"Niles: So am I, Adelle. But I'm mainly sorry for Daphne. How do you intend to handle that small matter? "
"Rodney: I was planning on telling her this evening at Granville's. We're meeting for drinks. "
"Niles: Granville's... why don't you do her a favor? Let me tell her. It might be better coming from a friend. "
"Rodney: Yes, perhaps you're right. Please tell her that I'm sorry. Sometimes, when a man meets the woman that he's meant to be with, there's nothing he can do to resist it. I hope Daphne understands that. "
"Niles: I hope she understands it too. "
"Frasier: Rodney... Adelle. "
"Frasier: You know, there's just one thing I'd like to ask you, "
"Rodney: do you have an older brother? "
"Rodney: As a matter of fact, I do. He's always been the pride of the family — handsome, successful, brilliant. I've always been rather jealous of him. "
"Frasier: Spooky. "
"TO: "
"Niles: Evening, Daphne. "
"Daphne: Hello, Dr. Crane. "
"Niles: You don't seem surprised to see me. "
"Daphne: I was running late, so I called Rodney on his cell phone. He told me everything. "
"Niles: Oh. I'm sorry. "
"Daphne: I'm sorry for you, too. Join me in a little sorrow-drowning? "
"Niles: I believe I will. One more of these, please. Thank you. [to Daphne] Well, I can't really blame Adelle. Rodney's that sort of man that women seem to go for. "
"Daphne: Yes, he is. "
"Niles: I'm sorry, I didn't mean to upset you. "
"Daphne: You didn't. I guess I'm just in more of a mood to hear about his negative qualities right now. "
"Niles: Well, he's a bit of a know-it-all, a bit fussy... "
"Daphne: Has to have everything just so, he's nuts about cleanliness, then there's his clothes, his precious shoes— "
"Niles: I don't like this road we're on. I mean, wouldn't it be better if we discussed what's in our futures? "
"Daphne: I suppose so. I'll tell you one thing. After the run I've had, I pity the next man I date. I'd probably rip him to shreds. "
"Niles: What about the man after that? "
"Daphne: Men can be such an unfeeling lot. Look at Rodney — the moment he heard I'd just broken up with someone, he moved right in for the kill. Is that how all men are? "
"Niles: No, not all men. "
"Daphne: Of course they aren't. You're not. You're kind, sensitive — you ask me, you were too good for that Adelle. "
"Niles: Thank you, Daphne. You know, the truth is my heart was never really in that relationship. "
"Daphne: I thought it might not be. "
"Niles: There was someone else who was too much on my mind. "
"Daphne: I had a feeling, Dr. Crane. "
"Niles: You did? "
"Daphne: Yes. As long as you still have feelings for your wife, you know you can't be involved with anyone else. It makes sense to me — I know I'd never get involved with a man who was separated. "
"Niles: Even if he'd worshipped you from the day he laid eyes on you? "
"Daphne: And don't think that's not just how they put it, too No, I think I need to do a bit of separating myself — from Joe, I mean. Yes, I'll wait a good long time before I do anymore dating. "
"Niles: Well, I'm glad to hear that. "
"Daphne: You know, it's funny when you think about it — the two of us coming to this same singles bar this week? Why, this was the very stool I was on when I met Rodney. "
"Niles: I was sitting here when I met Adelle. What? "
"Daphne: Oh, I was just thinking. If it'd been a different time in both our lives, we might actually have met. How do you suppose that would have gone? "
"Niles: What, our conversation? "
"Daphne: Yeah, come on Just for fun — we could both use a smile. "
"Niles: Well, uh... first I would have said, 'Is this seat taken?' And you would have said, 'no.' You would have said, 'my name is Daphne,' and I would have said 'my name is Niles.' And then I would have said... 'What are you doing for the rest of your life?' "
"Daphne: You always know just what to say. [then, as a friend would say it] Oh, I love you, Dr. Crane. "
"Niles: I love you too, Daphne. "

"Niles: Hello? Yes, Buck? It's Dr. Crane. I'm calling to see if the cabin is ready for us. You've got the case of Montrachet? Good, good. And the Thanksgiving feast will be delivered promptly at three? Good. And the woodpile's been thoroughly inspected for spiders? Excellent Thank you. Well, we're ready to rough it in the great Northwest "
"Daphne: If you don't mind me asking, are you taking along anything to keep your nephew amused? "
"Niles: Yes, his grandfather. Oh, by the way, what time are Lilith and Frederick flying in tomorrow? "
"Martin: Her broom touches down at eleven. "
"Frasier: All right, now, when you mist the plants, make sure that the water is not too cold. I know I'm harping on and on about this, but I know you're not used to dealing with delicate flowers. "
"Roz: I've produced your show for three years, haven't I? "
"Frasier: I'll leave you our number at Niles's cabin, in case anything goes wrong. Oh, yes, and by the way, I frown on overnight guests. "
"Roz: Then you're not doing it right. "
"Daphne: I'll leave you my number in San Francisco, too. "
"Roz: You're not going to the cabin with them? "
"Frasier: No, no, Daphne's decided to spend a traditional Thanksgiving with her transvestite Uncle Jackie. "
"Daphne: Come on, Roz, I'll show you around the kitchen. "
"Roz: So, this uncle of yours, does he dress like a woman all the time? "
"Daphne: Oh, certainly not for work. His congregation would never stand for it. "
"Martin: What's wrong? "
"Niles: Oh, just a little depressed. It's my first Thanksgiving without Maris. "
"Martin: Oh, yeah, I know, son. It's hard. "
"Niles: Do you remember the year I plopped that big wedge of pumpkin pie in front of her, and we all laughed? [They all share a chuckle.] Then I put a big scoop of whipped cream on top of it and we laughed some more Then her eyes welled up with tears and we all knew it was time to stop. "
"Frasier: Yeah. "
"Frasier: Hello? Yes, Lilith. Yes, Lilith. Yes, Lilith. "
"Martin: Gee, it's like they're still married. "
"TO: the kitchen. "
"Daphne: If you change the paper towels, he likes the flap facing the front. If you change the bathroom tissue, the flap faces the back, don't ask me why. "
"Roz: I don't know how you live with him. "
"Daphne: Huh, I don't know how you work with him. "
"Roz: Well, I have learned a "
"trick: when he's really bugging me, I ask if he hasn't lost a little weight. Before you know it, he's checking his butt out in the glass of the candy machine. "
"Daphne: Really? I tell him he's gained weight. He skips dinner, sulks in his room, and I have the whole evening to myself. "
"TO: the living room. "
"Frasier: OK, you tell Frederick I said 'Bravo' Frederick just passed the qualifying exam for the Marbury Academy "
"Niles: Huzzah "
"Martin: What is that? Some school? "
"Frasier: 'Some-school?' Oh, Dad, please. The Marbury Academy is the most exclusive private school in all of Boston. "
"Niles: It's a breeding ground of power and privilege. "
"Frasier: Lilith and I have to be interviewed by the headmaster. He's got such a busy schedule, he's agreed to see us on Thanksgiving morning. Now this, of course, changes our plans. "
"Martin: Wait, you mean I don't get to see my grandson? "
"Frasier: Of course you do. We'll move our whole Thanksiving celebration to Boston. I'll call the airline. "
"Niles: Yes, I better cancel our rustic Thanksgiving. Hello, Buck? It's Dr. Crane. Take the mints off the pillows. "
"Lilith: Frederick, your father is here. ' The three "
"Martin: Hi, Lilith, how ya doin'? "
"Niles: Happy Thanksgiving, Lilith. "
"Lilith: Martin, Niles. "
"Martin: Nice neighborhood. Noticed a whole bunch of kids Freddie's age playing in the street. "
"Lilith: Yes, he's spent many happy hours at his window observing their play patterns. Niles, I'm afraid with this interview, I'm running a little behind schedule. So, I'm enlisting you to help with the turkey. "
"Niles: Oh, well, I've never cooked a turkey before, but the recipe's here, I guess I can fumble my way through. How far along are you? "
"Lilith: I'm nearly done defrosting. "
"Niles: And the turkey? "
"Lilith: Might I suggest you stuff it? "
"Frasier: So the rabbit said to the bear, 'No, no, I said 'oedipal,' not 'edible'' "
"Freddie: Good one, Dad. "
"Frasier: Hello, Lilith. "
"Lilith: You're late. "
"Frasier: Oh, well, happy Thanksgiving to you, too. Well, there Frederick. Now, Mommy and Daddy have to head off to this meeting, then I'm all yours. Meanwhile, why don't you head off upstairs and show Grandad and Uncle Niles your brand-new computer. "
"Freddie: OK. "
"Martin: Come on, sport. "
"Frasier: My God, are you half as nervous as I am? "
"Lilith: And then some. "
"Frasier: We have got to master our nerves. It is vital that we appear to be well-adjusted, responsible parents. Lilith, do you still keep the Valium with the contraceptives? "
"Lilith: Sorry, I needed the last one just to go in and pick up the application. "
"Frasier: I'll assume you meant the Valium. "
"Lilith: Perhaps before the interview, you should sheath that butter-knife sharp wit of yours. "
"Frasier: Perhaps we could find the appropriate kitchen tool to ratchet down that butt of yours a notch or two "
"Lilith: Frasier, stop. We should be focusing on our son. "
"Frasier: You're right, of course. We've always had our differences but we've been able to put them aside for the welfare of Frederick. "
"Lilith: And this may be the most important thing we ever do to ensure his happiness. "
"Frasier: Not counting our divorce. "
"Martin: Hey, Freddie and I are gonna break in this new mitt I bought him. "
"Lilith: Uh, Frederick doesn't play ball. He was just about to watch 'Pocahontas' and write a satirical essay on the historical inaccuracies. "
"Frasier: Well, we're off. "
"Niles: Oh, no, wait, where do you keep your saffron? "
"Lilith: Third cupboard. "
"Niles: Mm-hmm, and where do you keep your shallots? "
"Lilith: In the crisper. By the way, you still have to remove the entrails from the chest cavity. "
"Niles: In that case, where do you keep your ten-foot pole? "
"Frasier: All right, now, Freddie. Mommy and Daddy are going to see you're wearing a Marbury blazer or die trying. "
"Niles: Dad, maybe you should remove the entrails. "
"Martin: No can do. Freddie and me are gonna play catch. "
"Freddie: Mother says balls are for the slow children. "
"Martin: Yeah? Well, Grandpa's in charge now. You're gonna love baseball, it's easy as riding a bike. "
"Freddie: Mother says bikes are for the... "
"Martin: Yeah, I know, I know. "
"TO: "
"Lilith: Dr. Campbell. "
"Campbell: Dr. Sternin. "
"Frasier: Dr. Campbell. "
"Campbell: Dr. Crane. Please come in. "
"Lilith: You have a lovely home. "
"Frasier: Yes, and thank you so much for seeing us today. "
"Campbell: You're quite welcome. Make yourselves comfortable, I'll get us some coffee. "
"Lilith: Thank you. "
"Frasier: I think that went rather well, don't you? "
"Lilith: So far, so good. "
"Frasier: Oh my God, we have just got to get Frederick into this school. "
"Lilith: I am so nervous, I feel as though all the color has drained from my face. How is my makeup? "
"Frasier: Well, you could use a pinch. "
"Lilith: Do I have time? "
"Frasier: No, you could use a pinch. [He pinches her cheeks hard to put some color in them.] "
"Lilith: Thank you. "
"Frasier: Oh, oh lord. Oh, dear. "
"Lilith: What? What? "
"Frasier: Well, I just reached down to pull a thread off what I thought was my jacket, it seems it attached to this cushion. Oh, look, now this little bird has no beak "
"Lilith: Stop doing that "
"Frasier: Give me your nail clippers. "
"Lilith: I didn't bring them, just bite it off. "
"Campbell: Does either of you take cream? "
"Frasier: Oh, yes, thank you. "
"Campbell: Then let me begin by saying that the child who fills this opening need not worry for the future. "
"Lilith: Opening? There's only one? "
"Campbell: Yes. Well, children of alumni and certain generous benefactors are of course given preference. "
"Frasier: Oh, of course. "
"Lilith: Of course. "
"Campbell: Now, regarding your Frederick. His scores are of course excellent and I've no doubt he's being courted by other prestigious schools. "
"Lilith: Oh, yes. "
"Frasier: Yes, that goes without saying. "
"Campbell: Still, we like to think we are a cut above. Our sixth grade talent show just formed a highly successful cast album. "
"Lilith: Frederick has perfect pitch. "
"Frasier: Yes, we often use him to tune the piano. "
"Campbell: Excuse me. Hello? Ah, Senator Geiger. I thought I made it perfectly plain that you'd be notified by mail. Well, Senator, rules may not mean anything on Capitol Hill, but they still mean something to me. And that is why young Noah will be seeking his education elsewhere. Do I SOUND flexible? Marbury thanks you for your interest. "
"Lilith: Frasier, your coffee. "
"Campbell: Oh, yes, please be careful. Those chairs have been in the family for three generations. "
"TO: "
"Martin: OK, let's take a look. Oh, it's not so bad. "
"Niles: AHH "
"Freddie: Uh-oh, I lost my MedicAlert bracelet. "
"Martin: Well, maybe it fell off when we were playin' catch. "
"Freddie: I'll go look. "
"Martin: All right. I still don't know how it happened. I lobbed it right to him. "
"Niles: When are you going to learn, Dad? The only thing the Crane boys are skilled at catching is sarcastic nuance and the occasional virus. Let's make a pact that while we are guests of Lilith's we'll avoid all activities that could possibly harm Frederick. Where are those pie crusts? "
"Freddie: Found it. "
"Freddie: I taste blood. "
"Martin: Now you've done it "
"Niles: Oh, God, Frederick, I am so sorry. "
"Martin: It's them Hey, pal, why don't we go find some cotton upstairs for that thing, huh? "
"Niles: Dad, wait, wait, how am I going to explain this to Lilith? "
"Martin: Well, I don't know. How did you give Maris bad news? "
"Niles: Usually by breaking a tranquilizer in her Slim Fast. "
"Lilith: Did you notice how those patrician eyebrows of his arched when you mentioned Frederick's National Science Award? "
"Frasier: Yes. "
"Niles: I take it Dr. Campbell was favorably impressed. "
"Lilith: We had an initial bout of nervousness, but after that, we did an absolute bang-up job. "
"Niles: Speaking of bang-up jobs... "
"Frasier: You know, Lilith, there's just one question I wished we'd answered differently. "
"Lilith: Which one? "
"Frasier: Remember when he mentioned that Frederick was being courted by other schools? I wonder if we shouldn't have made it clear that Marbury is far and away our first choice. "
"Lilith: Frasier, if you over-analyze every detail, you will rob us of the joy of the moment. It will be our wedding night all over again. "
"Niles: Speaking of hard-to-explain bruises... "
"Frasier: Well, you know, you're right, you're right, of course. I'm sure everything's fine. "
"Lilith: Unless we didn't convey to him how highly we regard Marbury. "
"Frasier: Well, you see, that is my worry. "
"Lilith: We must correct this. What should I say? "
"Frasier: Oh, Lilith, stop, stop. Remember what happened when the senator called. We need a ruse. "
"Lilith: You're right. How's this? We go back and I say that I lost my earring in his living room. "
"Frasier: And while we're looking for it, we casually mention that Marbury is Frederick's first and only choice. "
"Lilith: Perfect. "
"Frasier: Let's go. "
"Niles: Speaking of dumb-ass ideas... "
"Frasier: Ah, yes, Dr. Campbell, I hope we're not disturbing anything important. "
"Campbell: Well, actually, I'm a bit frazzled trying to get my Thanksgiving dinner together. "
"Lilith: I'm afraid I lost an earring here this morning. "
"Campbell: Well, I'll have a look around and call you if it turns up. "
"Frasier: Well, um... "
"Lilith: Do you think I might be able to take a peek right now? I wouldn't even think of asking, but it was a treasured gift from... Golda Meir. "
"Campbell: Very well. "
"Lilith: Thank you. "
"Campbell: Forgive me. I must turn the heat down on the pumpkin soup. "
"Frasier: Lilith, we rehearsed everything we were going to say on the ride over. Where the hell did Golda Meir come from? "
"Lilith: Well, I admit it wasn't half as clever as 'Umm...' but it got us in. "
"Campbell: Any luck? "
"Frasier: Not yet. "
"Lilith: We're so sorry for this. The whole ride over, we kept saying 'Why did this have to happen at the only school that matters to us?' "
"Frasier: Yes, as you know, Marbury is our first choice. "
"Lilith: Oh, look, here it is. That was lucky. "
"Campbell: Remarkably so, considering that wasn't the chair you were sitting in. "
"Lilith: Umm... "
"Frasier: Well, I suppose it's time we be shoving off. "
"Campbell: I'm curious. I've always been a great admirer of Mrs. Meir. How did you meet? "
"Lilith: Oh, well, it's a funny story. Frasier you tell it much better than I do. "
"Frasier: Oh, yes, yes, yes. Back in college days, Lilith spent a summer at a kibbutz. And, uh, was dating her grandson, Oscar. "
"Campbell: That would be Oscar Meir? "
"Frasier: Yes, well just imagine the ribbing he took. "
"Campbell: Indeed. Well it was so good seeing you both again. Enjoy you're Thanksgiving. Marbury thanks you for your interest. "
"Frasier: Wait, wait a minute. 'Marbury thanks you for your interest.' We know what that means. "
"Campbell: Oh good, then you'll have no trouble interpreting this. "
"TO: "
"Niles: You had to give him gum, didn't you? And not just gum, bubblegum. "
"Martin: Well, maybe what threw him off is having to breathe through his mouth while he chewed it. "
"Niles: You know, Frederick, when I was a boy, nothing brought a smile to my face like when Mother would make a remoulade and let me lick the spoon. "
"Freddie: Thanks, Uncle Niles. "
"Niles: You're welcome. "
"Martin: You think maybe I should trim his bangs a little bit? "
"Niles: Maybe you should put the scissors down while he still has one good eye. "
"Freddie: Uh-oh. Is there anchovies in this? "
"Niles: Yes. Oh my God I've never seen hives break out that fast They're back "
"Martin: Freddie, you got any pills for this? "
"Freddie: I got pills for everything. "
"Lilith: Of all the name in the universe, you had to pick Oscar? "
"Frasier: You started us down that path of insanity. Golda Meir. Golda My-ass "
"Lilith: This sniping is pointless. Getting into Marbury was a longshot anyway. You heard the man. Most of these openings go to children of alumni and generous benefactors. "
"Frasier: Yes, yes. Wait a minute. Oh, my God we're such fools Don't you see what the man was trying to tell us? He was trying to give us the way to get Frederick accepted. "
"Lilith: Are you saying he was fishing for a donation? So you think he was just trying to see if we were willing to pay our fair share. "
"Frasier: What else? "
"Freddie: Hi, Daddy. "
"Frasier: In a minute, Frederick. My God, it was right there in front of us and we missed it, we didn't even see it. "
"Lilith: How could we be so blind? "
"Frasier: Well, we should get ourselves back down there and give the man what he wants. "
"Lilith: Right, we can't let anything stand in the way of our son's welfare. "
"Freddie: Mother... "
"Lilith: Mother has to run, munchkin. Go play with Grandpa. "
"TO: "
"Campbell: Ah, Dr. Sternin and Dr. Crane. Forgive me if I don't give you a big hello hug, but as you can see, I'm wearing this greasy apron. On top of which, I'm beginning to loathe the sight of both of you. "
"Lilith: All the more reason for us to be brief. "
"Campbell: Yes, I'm sure you'll be on your way, just as soon as you've found the cufflink given to you by Haile Selassie. "
"Lilith: No false pretense this time. We know that with so many qualified applicants and only one position open, that your decision must be very difficult. "
"Frasier: Yes, and so, in the spirit of the holidays, like Indians to your pilgrims' table, we bring this little bit of garnish, as it were, in the hopes that our relationship may flower. "
"Campbell: I'll have you know that, in twenty-two years, I have never accepted a bribe. I have to tell you, I find this utterly offensive. In every possible way. And now, if you don't mind, I have guests on the way. And a turkey so undercooked, a skilled veterinarian could still save him. "
"Frasier: But, Dr. Campbell... "
"Campbell: Unless the rest of that sentence is 'I have a fully cooked turkey in the breast pocket of that blazer,' I'm afraid our conversation is at an end. "
"TO: "
"TO: "
"Campbell: This is indeed a very special holiday for us all. Pamela, Cynthia, I'm particularly grateful that finally you've been able to set aside your differences and join us in this Thanksgiving... tortellini. "
"Pamela: Well, as angry as I was that you'd admitted Regan into Marbury instead of our Wesley, it's all worked out for the best. Wesley is thriving at the Barkley School. "
"Campbell: I am delighted to hear it. Oh, I have a dusty bottle of Chateau LeFite waiting in the cellar for an occasion like this. "
"Preston: Well, this is nice. "
"Elliot: Yes, it is. "
"Cynthia: Hello. "
"Lilith: Hello, is Dr. Campbell in? "
"Cynthia: Yes, he's just gone to the cellar to get a bottle of wine. "
"Frasier: Yes, we don't mean to intrude, but we heard he was having trouble with his turkey and we thought we should drop this by. "
"Cynthia: Oh, how very generous of you. Please come in. Look everyone, these friends of Collin's have brought us a turkey. "
"Frasier: Well, I think 'friends' is probably stretching it just a tad. "
"Lilith: You see, our son was a candidate for Marbury, and in our zeal to see him accepted we may have come on a bit strongly. "
"Frasier: Yes, well, I'm sure you'll understand as parents yourselves, it's only natural to wish only the very best for your son. "
"Cynthia: Oh, absolutely. "
"Pamela: There are other good schools. Barkley is excellent. "
"Frasier: Well, yes, thank you very much for trying to cheer us up, but I mean, if you're looking for filet mignon, you can hardly swallow ground chuck. "
"Cynthia: Now, now, Barkley is a very charming little school. "
"Pamela: 'Little school'? "
"Cynthia: Now, don't be so sensitive. "
"Pamela: Damn your condescension. "
"Cynthia: Damn your jealousy. "
"Elliot: Don't you talk to my wife that way "
"Preston: Oh, shut up, Elliot "
"Campbell: Quiet "
"Frasier: We brought a turkey. "
"Campbell: I don't know how this started, I can only be sure it started with the two of you. "
"Lilith: Actually... "
"Campbell: I will die a happy man if I never set eyes on either of you again. Unfortunately, there is only one way I can think of to ensure "
"that: your son Frederick is hereby admitted to the Marbury School. "
"Frasier: Oh "
"Campbell: However - he will immediately be expelled if either of you violates any of the following "
"conditions: you will not bring him to school, you will not collect him; you will not attend any recitals, plays, sporting events, or school functions, up to and including 'Frederick Crane Day,' should we ever have one. And when graduation comes, you will dispatch an appropriate envoy with a video camera. And now it is with great pleasure that I bid you goodbye - forever "
"Frasier: Allow me. "
"Both: We're in "

"Martin: Look, we had an agreement. We went to see a movie I wanted to see, so I'm supposed to pay for the tickets. "
"Frasier: Very well, Dad. The next time we go to see a Jean-Claude Van Damme movie, not only may you pay for the tickets, but also for the wild horses it will take to drag me there "
"Martin: Well, I'm only mad because we had an agreement. Now, a man's supposed to honour his agreement, didn't you learn anything from that movie? "
"Frasier: Yes, only that bullets are useless against the man who can kick really high "
"Martin: Now, look, I'm serious about this. Once in a while I'd like to pay. "
"Frasier: Okay. "
"Martin: Okay, so the next time we go anywhere, it's on me. Have I made my point? "
"Frasier: Yes, Dad, with all the subtlety Mr. Van Damme displayed when he jet-packed into the Vatican to subdue that nasty Pope imposter "
"Martin: Like you saw that coming "
"Niles: Well, Maris has finally deigned to call me back after I'd left no fewer than twenty messages "
"Frasier: Honestly, Niles, by calling her so many times you give her all the power. You're much better off coming from a position of strength "
"Niles: Don't pour that sherry on your shirt, it will stain. "
"Frasier: What? "
"Niles: I'm sorry, I thought this was the portion of the afternoon where we gave each other patently obvious advice I had to call Maris You know that party I'm throwing for my country club friends. "
"Frasier: Oh, yes. The one I wasn't invited to but my Waterford punch bowl was "
"Niles: Yes, well... Maris has chosen the exact same night to throw a party of her own. "
"Frasier: Well, couldn't you ask her to postpone? "
"Niles: I tried. She's already flown in a sculptor from Sweden to capture her likeness in ice. "
"Frasier: Ah, the perfect marriage of subject and medium "
"Niles: Well, you can see my problem. We're going to be competing now for which friends go to which party. "
"Frasier: You know Niles, for a separated couple still hoping to reconcile I'm afraid you're going down a path... "
"Niles: You shouldn't wear that tie with that jacket. "
"Frasier: Oh, I see. Is that your clever way of telling me I'm dispensing unwanted criticism? "
"Niles: That too "
"Daphne: Hello, boys. "
"Both: Hello, Daphne. "
"Daphne: Dr. Crane – will you be joining us for dinner? "
"Niles: What a nice invitation. I'd love to. "
"Daphne: Well then, you're in for a treat. I've decided to make Grammy Moon's famous 'Sheep's Head Stew.' [notes the concerned faces in front of her] Oh, don't worry. The name's a bit misleading. It's actually more of a soup "
"Martin: You actually use a real sheep's head? "
"Daphne: Well, you have to. It's right in here. "
"Frasier: Oh my God – I just remembered. We have reservations at Le Cigare Volante tonight "
"Niles: Oh my God, you're right. "
"Martin: Oh Jeez, I nearly forgot. "
"Daphne: You're going too, Mr. Crane? "
"Martin: Well, I promised the boys. I don't suppose there's any way you guys would let me out of this, is there? [there is general protestations all round which Martin quite happily gives in to] Well, I tried "
"Daphne: Well, have fun. I'm off to stick me head in the oven. "
"Daphne: Hello, Marshall? I got rid of them. You bring some wine and I'll throw the steaks on. "
"Frasier: Oh dear Lord, it's rather busy. Let's keep our fingers crossed. Francois "
"Francois: Ah, Dr. Crane. Bonsoir. "
"Frasier: Bonsoir. "
"Francois: Dr. Crane. Bonsoir. "
"Niles: Bonsoir. "
"Frasier: And this is our father, Martin Crane. "
"Francois: Ah, Monsieur Crane. "
"Martin: How you doing? "
"Francois: Enchante "
"Frasier: Francois, I'm afraid we are at your mercy tonight. You see, we have no reservations. "
"Francois: Oh la la, Dr. Crane. I will see what I can do. "
"Frasier: Thank you, thank you. Anything would be just fine, thank you. Come to think of it we haven't been here since Chef Wakim had his pinky grafted back on. "
"Francois: Oh. Then this is your first time seeing our new artwork. He's my own discovery. His name is Cordoba "
"Frasier: Exquisite "
"Niles: Stunning "
"Frasier: My God, I don't think I've ever seen such fearless use of colour. You know, as usual your taste is as fine as your cuisine. Any luck? "
"Francois: For you, yes. For Dr. Dubain who brings his own wine, no Follow me, please. "
"Frasier: Merci bien "
"Francois: Your table is ready. "
"Martin: You guys go ahead. I've got to make a little visit to Le Can "
"Francois: Le menu I will be back with the wine list. "
"Frasier: Wine list? My God, he ought to bring us blindfolds. I mean, what is he thinking with this artwork? It's appalling "
"Niles: Who is it who said that art in restaurants is on the same level with food in museums? "
"Frasier: The little white lies one will tell for a good table. Of course I would compliment a black velvet Elvis right now if Chef Wakim's lobster comfit were at stake "
"Niles: Frasier, that's Winchett Cook. She's one of the guests Maris and I are competing over for our parties. I'm going to go woo her. "
"Frasier: Oh really, Niles. Why don't you just reschedule your party? "
"Niles: Because I don't want to give Maris the satisfaction. She's pushed me around long enough. "
"Frasier: All right. "
"Niles: Metaphorically, of course. In reality she can hardly push at all. Like that terrible afternoon last spring she spent trapped in the revolving doors at Bergdorf's "
"Martin: I hope there's something on there you like 'cos dinner's on me tonight. "
"Frasier: What do you mean, Dad? "
"Martin: We had an agreement. Next time we went out it was my treat. "
"Frasier: Yes Dad, but when I said that what I meant was... "
"Martin: Hup We're not discussing it. "
"Frasier: Yes, but Dad the trouble is here... "
"Martin: Hup You promised. "
"Frasier: I just don't... "
"Martin: Hup "
"Frasier: All right, all right, your treat. "
"Martin: Thank you. Now don't worry about it – just order whatever you want... [Martin examines the menu and his face turns to a look of abject horror. Meanwhile Francois has returned with the wine list] Is this per person? "
"Francois: The wine list. "
"Frasier: Thank you. Thank you, Francois but I don't believe we'll be having any wine tonight [hands back the wine list] "
"Francois: And I'm going out for a Big Mac after work "
"Frasier: No, I'm really being quite serious. You see, my brother and I are watching our caloric intake tonight – we'll be eating light. "
"Francois: As you wish, Doctor. "
"Martin: I know what you're doing, you know. I'm not stupid. "
"Frasier: What are you talking about? "
"Martin: You're eating light? All the way over here you had the same look on your face that Eddie gets when he hears a can opener "
"Frasier: Look, Dad – it's just that I'm not that comfortable ordering an expensive meal when you're paying. "
"Martin: Well, what's the big deal? You take me to places like this all the time. "
"Frasier: I can afford it I'm sorry. I didn't mean that the way it sounded. I know how you feel. "
"Martin: No, you don't. You're always paying for me and I'm never allowed to pay for you. Well, it feels pretty lousy. Well, go ahead, Mr. Bigshot – you pay "
"Frasier: Dad "
"Niles: Well, the good news is Winchett has agreed to come to my party. The bad news is I've left my wallet at home so, Frasier, I'm afraid this is on you. "
"Frasier: Actually, tonight's dinner is on Dad. "
"Martin: No, you ruined it. I'm not paying. "
"Frasier: Well, I'm not paying. "
"Niles: Well, I can't pay "
"Francois: So that would be three Happy Meals to go? "
"TO: "
"Daphne: No, he never suspected a thing. Yes, I had a great time too. Oh go on, Marshall – say it again. [after a brief pause she chuckles to herself] Now say it how you said it last night like Donald Duck. [another brief pause but Daphne is now stony faced] Well, I guess it was the wine that made it funny. [the key is heard in the front door and Daphne rushes up] Yes, I'll see you tonight. Bye. "
"Both: Hello. "
"Daphne: Hello. "
"Frasier: Will you be savouring us with any English delicacies tonight? "
"Daphne: Well as a matter of fact, yes. The butcher had in some lovely carved stomachs so I'm going to try my hand at haggis. "
"Frasier: Even Hannibal Lecter couldn't keep that woman's cooking down "
"Niles: Hello? Ah, Winchett – so looking forward to seeing you at the party. Oh, how dreadful. Oh, you poor thing. No, no, of course I understand. The important thing is that you get better. You are a dear for calling... [hangs up phone] ...you lying, two-faced cow "
"Frasier: So she's not really sick? "
"Niles: Oh, hardly. Maris is luring away all my confirmed guests. Suddenly there are accidents, deaths in the family. A wave of misfortune is sweeping through society's blue bloods at a rate unprecedented since the French Revolution "
"Martin: Oh great, you're back. Hey, listen. About last night at the restaurant – I'm really sorry. "
"Frasier: Oh, no, no, no Dad. It was my fault. I should have been more gracious. "
"Martin: No, no, it was my fault. I was the one who overreacted. I just really wanted to do something nice for you. You know, the older you get the harder it is to do stuff for your kids. "
"Frasier: I understand. I tell you what. Next three dinners are on you. "
"Martin: No, no, no. I found something better than that. I finally found something I know you're gonna like. [heading back through to the bedroom] Now just a minute. This is going to be so great. "
"Frasier: My God – I haven't seen him this excited since he got that four-in-one remote control "
"ever: that painting "
"Martin: It's a Cordoba. "
"Niles: Ole "
"Martin: Yeah, you guys were raving about these paintings last night so I went down to the restaurant this morning to find out where they got theirs and lucky me, the ones they had were for sale. "
"Frasier: Dad, this is awfully, awfully... "
"Martin: Expensive Yeah, yeah but it's worth it. You don't know how good this makes me feel. After I'm gone this will still be here. "
"Martin: Hey Daph, come here. Take a look at this. "
"Daphne: Well, I'm very impressed, Mr. Crane. When did you have the time to do that? "
"Martin: Oh, sure. Like I could paint something like this. You know, I was thinking, maybe, we could put it over the fireplace. "
"Frasier: Yes, yes, the fireplace. That's the first place I thought of too "
"Greg: ...and lately I've had the chronic fluctuating mood disturbances which would indicate psychothymic disorder. I mean, the hypomanic symptoms are there and yet I'm experiencing moments of aphasia and aproxia and I just want to pull my teeth out, Dr. Crane. What do you think? "
"Frasier: Well, Greg, two possible diagnoses come to mind. Either you are seriously mentally ill and you should be institutionalized immediately, or you are a first-year psychology student "
"Greg: Oh yeah, I'm at UW. "
"Frasier: Yes, well, it's not uncommon for students to feel that they're manifesting symptoms that they are studying. It'll pass. "
"Greg: What do I do till it passes? "
"Frasier: Well, just relax. Though it might be a good idea to postpone reading about male sexual disorder until after spring break. That's all the time we have for today. This is Dr. Frasier Crane, KACL 780. "
"Roz: Good show. "
"Frasier: Thanks, Roz. Say, Roz, if you're not busy after work would you like, maybe, to get a drink or something? Maybe see a movie? You pick, I'll pay? "
"Roz: You can stay out as late as you want but eventually you're going to have to go home and that painting will still be there You have to tell him. "
"Frasier: I can't, Roz. You didn't see the look on his face when he gave it to me. "
"Roz: Frasier, have I ever told you about my ceramic hippo collection? "
"Frasier: Oh yes, many times. "
"Roz: The hell I have Shut up and listen One Christmas my Grandma sent me a ceramic hippo... "
"Frasier: Roz, a hippo cannot possibly be as repellant as a rabid matador killing an epileptic bull "
"Roz: Was the bull wearing a pork-pie hat and fishing off a dock? "
"Frasier: Continue. "
"Roz: I made the mistake of telling her how much I loved it. Well, that just opened the floodgates. I got ice-skating hippos and hula-hooping hippos. Thank God for that earthquake. "
"Frasier: Oh, you mean they broke? "
"Roz: Well, I assume they did when they hit the bottom of the garbage chute. But I blamed it on the earthquake, and the point is, you need to talk to your father now and be honest with him or you're gonna be stuck with that thing until the next natural disaster. "
"Frasier: You're right, Roz. Guess I'll just have to tell him this afternoon. [goes to leave the studio but turns back with a thoughtful expression] Oh, Roz - that crystal vase I gave you three years ago for Christmas... er... you said that was broken in the earthquake? "
"Roz: Oh, no, no, that really was. I was very disappointed. As disappointed as you were when Eddie chewed up that sweater I gave you for Christmas "
"Frasier: This year – liquor? "
"Roz: Deal "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Hi, Dad. "
"Martin: Hey, Fraz. "
"Frasier: You know, Dad, I was just down in the storage room putting away some boxes and guess what I came across – that smoking jacket I gave you for Christmas last year? "
"Martin: The shiny one? "
"Frasier: Not shiny, Dad. Silk I really messed up on that one, didn't I? Buying things for other people – it's so hard sometimes, isn't it? "
"Martin: Yeah. Hey, you want some pastrami? There's more in the fridge. "
"Frasier: Oh, no, no, Dad. I don't really care for pastrami. Isn't that funny? You can love something so much and I would find it distasteful? People have different tastes, you know? "
"Martin: Yeah, well that's one way of looking at it. Some people like pastrami, like me. Other people don't. They're nuts "
"Niles: Afternoon. "
"Frasier: Afternoon, Niles. "
"Martin: Hi, Niles. "
"Niles: Dad. Frasier, I'm here to pick up the punch bowl for my party. Although at this point a soup bowl might suffice. Thanks to Maris I'm down to three confirmed guests. "
"Frasier: Three? Yesterday it was twelve, wasn't it? "
"Niles: She's circulating a vicious rumour that I'm going to have a karaoke machine "
"Frasier: You know, this vindictive behaviour of Maris's is completely out of line. You know, if you don't want to continue with it you really should call her on the phone. Confront her. "
"Niles: You're absolutely right. It's time I took the bull by the horns. [as he dials he realises what he's said and has another withering glance over at the painting] Sorry [he gets through to Maris] Maris. Niles. You may feel you've triumphed, but all you've done is shown yourself to be petty and uncivil. Frankly, the only people lower than you are the fickle paramecia that deserted my party to attend yours. Uh-huh. Oh, I see. Very well. Yes. I'll see you at eight – should I bring anything? "
"Frasier: Thank God for the starch in that shirt or there'd be nothing holding you upright "
"Martin: Hey, Niles. Here. "
"Niles: Well, what's that? "
"Martin: It's a wine rack. "
"Niles: Really? "
"Martin: Yeah. I felt kind of bad about giving Frasier something and nothing for you, so I saw it at PriceBusters. "
"Niles: Well, thank you for the thought, Dad but it doesn't really fit in with the décor of my apartment. "
"Martin: Oh. Oh, well OK. No harm done. I'll take it back. Anybody want a beer? "
"Niles: No, thanks. "
"Frasier: No thanks, Dad. "
"Niles: Frasier, I no longer require your punch bowl, but may I borrow your blowdryer? "
"Frasier: Of course. Why? "
"Niles: Sven just finished Maris's ice sculpture and she's convinced she looks a bit 'hippy.' "
"Frasier: Dad? Are you sure Niles didn't just hurt your feelings there? "
"Martin: No. No. I'm glad he told me. I don't want to give him something he doesn't like. "
"Frasier: That's very wise. You know, it's important that fathers and sons can be honest with each other. It shows respect. You know I've been thinking, Dad, about the painting. You know, art is such a personal thing? What one person may like, another may not? It doesn't mean one of them is right and the other is wrong. "
"Martin: You're telling me you don't like the painting? "
"Frasier: Well, it's not that I don't like it. It's just that I don't love it. It's not me. "
"Martin: Not a problem – you don't like it, I'll take it back. "
"Frasier: Oh thank you, thank you, Dad. That's such a relief. You know, I was up half the night worrying about it and I just... Dad, are you all right? I didn't upset you, did I? My God, Dad, are you crying? "
"Martin: No "
"Frasier: Yes, you are. Yes, you are – I just saw you wipe your eye. "
"Martin: No, I didn't. Quit looking at me. "
"Frasier: Dad I made my father cry "
"Martin: Now don't you start. "
"Frasier: I'm only crying because you're crying. "
"Martin: I'm not crying. I don't know what this is. I didn't even cry when I got shot "
"Frasier: I didn't cry when you got shot either. "
"Martin: I'm getting rid of that damn painting right now. I just wish I knew why you told me you loved it so much? "
"Frasier: I wasn't lying. "
"Martin: You can't lie to me "
"Frasier: Dad. Dad, please. Please stop crying. I want to keep it now. "
"Martin: No, it's no good. "
"Frasier: No, no, it is good. It's very good. I love it. "
"Niles: Well, I found the... ...the... er... Dad, are you crying? Frasier, what happ... [sees Frasier sitting down sobbing uncontrollably] Oh my God, you're crying too. [also becoming emotional] Why is everybody crying? You know how I get when other people cry. Tell me what happened. "
"Frasier: I made our father cry. "
"Martin: I'm not crying. "
"Frasier: Well, I am. I'm the most ungrateful son there is "
"Martin: I can never do anything for my sons "
"Niles: No one wants to come to my party "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Dad. "
"Martin: Frasier. "
"Frasier: Don't you think we oughta talk about what happened this afternoon? "
"Martin: Nothing happened this afternoon. "
"Frasier: Look, Dad. I know you're disappointed about the painting. "
"Martin: That's not a problem. "
"Frasier: Well, you said yourself that it wasn't as easy for you to give me things as it was when I was a kid. "
"Martin: Yeah, well I wasn't very good at it then either. Your Mother always picked all your stuff out. "
"Frasier: Still, you did put a roof over my head. Sent me to school... "
"Martin: All right. You want to talk about this? We'll talk about it. Do people ever come up to you after they've met me and say, 'How can that guy be your father? He's nothing like you.' "
"Frasier: Well... "
"Martin: 'Cause they've been saying that to me about you for the last four years I just thought that... I don't know... I'd finally given you something. Something you liked. Something we both liked. That we had something in common or something. That's no big deal. I'm going to bed. "
"Frasier: Dad, Dad, just hang on a second, will you? Do you remember a time when I was six or seven years old? You were getting ready for work, you were getting dressed. I was playing with your badge and you sat me down and you said that it was not a toy. That it was a symbol of something very important. Of integrity and honesty and helping people. [Martin smiles to himself as he reminisces] Well, from then on, every time I'd see you put on that badge I would think of that. "
"Martin: I just said that so you'd stop playing with the damn thing. You were getting it all sticky. "
"Frasier: Be that as it may, I've tried to live up to your example and help other people. I've tried as a psychiatrist to conduct myself with the same integrity that you showed as a police officer. And when I find myself in a quandary as to the proper course of action, I think of you wearing that badge and then I know what I have to do. You gave me that "
"Martin: Yeah? "
"Frasier: Yeah, Dad. Thanks. "
"Martin: You know? I think I may have something else to give you. Something that I know you'll really like. I'll be back in a minute. "
"Martin: I've been holding onto this for quite a while now – waiting for the right time. "
"Frasier: My goodness, Dad. I'm speechless. Your ba... ...bow tie [Frasier is clearly none too impressed having expected something else] "
"Martin: They gave it to your Grandfather when he retired from the force. When I graduated from the Academy he gave it to me, and now I'm giving it to you, and someday you'll give it to Frederick. "
"Frasier: I don't know what to say. "
"Martin: You're not going to start crying, are you? "
"Frasier: No, no, no It's just a surprise, that's all. "
"Martin: Hey, wait a minute. You didn't think I was going to give you my badge, did you? "
"Frasier: Well... I... er... "
"Martin: My badge? That's a laugh. You'd have to pry it out of my cold, dead hands "
"Frasier: It's a date "

"Niles: Hello, Frasier. "
"Frasier: Hello, Niles. "
"Niles: Maureen. "
"Maureen: Hi, Niles. "
"Niles: A non-fat café, please. "
"Roz: I'll pay for his too. "
"Niles: Well, thank you. My day started off with good news and it's already getting better. To what do I owe this largesse? "
"Roz: Well, I'm having a pretty great day too. You see, a few months ago I took my first tennis lesson... "
"Niles: And you've finally mastered the backhand? "
"Roz: No, I haven't played since. But the guy who was teaching me... "
"Niles: Has won your girlish heart? "
"Roz: No, he was a loser. But that day he hit me this little dink- shot and I ran for it, stubbed my toe, got this big black toenail. It lasted for like three months and today it finally fell off. I can wear sandals again "
"Maureen: Thanks, Frasier. "
"Frasier: Goodbye Maureen, and good luck. "
"Maureen: Thanks. "
"Niles: Frasier. May I borrow your spoon? "
"Frasier: Certainly. "
"Niles: I have an announcement. "
"Frasier: Well frankly, so do I. Dad's girlfriend just told me some very big news. "
"Niles: Well, unless she's expecting our baby brother, my news takes precedence. She's not, is she? "
"Frasier: No, no. "
"Niles: Guess who just won this year's 'Mariett Fassbinder Award for Distinguished Contribution to the Literature of Psychiatry'? "
"Frasier: Well, judging by the canary feathers protruding from your mouth, I'd say you. What article did you win for? "
"Niles: A gripping case history of a narcissistic opera singer. I called it 'Me Me Me Me Me.' "
"Frasier: Very clever, I like that. "
"Niles: Thrilled as I am, I must admit I'm a tad nervous about the awards banquet. "
"Frasier: Why? "
"Niles: Dad I want him there of course, but I'm just dreading a rerun of Aunt Vi's wedding. "
"Frasier: Yes - the hour he spent regaling the table with Little Niles stories. "
"Niles: Exactly. Imagine an entire roomful of trained psychiatrists hearing the story of Sheldon, my imaginary protégé. "
"Frasier: Ah yes, Sheldon. That troubled little fellow who kept wetting your bed Well, you know – if you're thinking of excluding Dad from the event your timing couldn't be worse. It's his birthday this weekend. "
"Niles: Oh, right. "
"Frasier: On top of that Maureen just told me that she's decided to break it off with him. "
"Niles: No Oh dear, is it the age difference? "
"Frasier: No, no. She was quite emphatic on that point. She just thinks they have nothing in common. "
"Niles: Oh, poor Dad. I know how much he enjoyed going out with her. "
"Frasier: Yes. Just the other day he was saying that between her police badge and his handicapped sticker they could park anywhere. "
"Daphne: Evening, Dr. Crane. "
"Frasier: Daphne. Thank God you're home first. Listen, I have to warn you. "
"Daphne: About what? "
"Frasier: Dad and Maureen are on a date. It's not going well. She's telling him that she wants to break it off. "
"Daphne: Oh. This vision you're getting – is it a tingly feeling and a picture in your head, or more like a husky voice murmuring in your ear? "
"Frasier: It's not a vision. Maureen told me about this, this afternoon. I'm just worried about Dad. We need to do everything we can to help him through this. "
"Daphne: I wouldn't worry about your father. People are more resilient than you think. You know, when Joe dumped me a few weeks ago I thought I'd lost the love of me life. I figured I'd spend the rest of my years dwelling on what might have been. The home we'd have made; the children running through it; growing old together... did I mention Joe's getting married? "
"Frasier: Oh, I'm sorry. "
"Daphne: No, I'm all right. "
"Frasier: Oh, Daphne, Daphne... [checks the bottle's label] That'll be fine. "
"Maureen: Oh, I should have known that you'd hate Indian food. "
"Martin: No, it was great. It just takes a little getting used to. "
"Maureen: Yeah, it does. You should try it again sometime. "
"Martin: I think I just did. So are you going to come in for some coffee? "
"Maureen: Nah. You're not feeling too well. I think I'll just call it a night. "
"Martin: But I thought you said in the car there was something you wanted to talk about. "
"Maureen: It can wait. "
"Frasier: Hi, Dad. "
"Martin: Hi. "
"Frasier: How was your date? "
"Martin: Awful I never felt this bad in my life. I feel like my guts have been ripped out. "
"Frasier: Dad, let me assure you this has nothing to do with your age. "
"Martin: Oh, the hell it doesn't. This never would have happened twenty years ago. "
"Frasier: Well, you know Dad, I may be talking out of turn here. But Maureen told me about this. "
"Martin: What? "
"Frasier: Yes. She came to me for advice. That's how determined she was not to hurt you. You see, she wanted to make it perfectly clear that her breaking up with you had nothing to do with your age but rather your compatibility. You see, it's not your fault that you don't like the same food, music or movies... "
"Frasier: ...and she didn't bring this up, did she? "
"Martin: No. "
"Frasier: Dad, I'm sorry. "
"Martin: She doesn't want to see me again? "
"Frasier: Oh, I feel so terrible. Listen, Dad, I mean, I know exactly how you're feeling right now. But believe me, the pain will pass. It may take some time. "
"Martin: This is great "
"Frasier: Or not "
"Martin: Wait till I tell Sherry. "
"Frasier: Sherry? "
"Martin: This stuff works pretty good. Have we got any pretzels? "
"Frasier: Dad - just who is Sherry? "
"Martin: She's this great lady I met down at McGinty's. You know – I've been trying for weeks to get up the nerve to end it with Maureen. "
"Frasier: Good Lord. I've been worried all afternoon about Maureen breaking your heart and all along you've been two-timing- "
"Frasier: MAUREEN "
"Martin: Well hi, Maureen. Come in. Did you forget something? "
"Maureen: Yes I did. Um... "
"Frasier: Don't mind me, I was just going out... [he realises he is in his dressing gown] ...to the powder room. "
"Maureen: There's something that I've been meaning to say to you and I keep putting it off and that's not fair to you. "
"Martin: What is it? "
"Maureen: I don't think it's working out. "
"Martin: You don't? Wow. I didn't see that coming. "
"Maureen: Marty, it's not the age difference. It's just all we ever talk about is the police force - and I enjoy that - but I just think... "
"Martin: No, Maureen, come on. You don't need to explain. You know, I guess I always knew that I could never hold onto a prize like you forever. [slams the bathroom door shut in Frasier's face with his cane] But at least I did it for a while. "
"Maureen: So, are you OK? "
"Martin: I will be. It just takes a little time, you know? But you take care of yourself. "
"Maureen: Yeah, you too. "
"Frasier: You old fraud "
"Martin: What? "
"Frasier: You made her believe that she'd broken your heart. "
"Martin: Well, of course I did. When a woman breaks up with you, you have to act sad. It's only polite. "
"Frasier: Polite? My God, Dad, guilt is a very destructive emotion. "
"Martin: Oh, spare me the Ivy League bull. There ain't a dame alive who wouldn't rather break a guy's heart than think she hadn't even made a dent in it. I may not have made it to Harvard but I have been to the College of Love. "
"Frasier: Apparently on a Spillane Fellowship "
"TO: "
"Daphne: Hello, Dr. Crane. "
"Niles: Hey, Daphne. "
"Frasier: Niles. "
"Niles: Frasier. Where's the birthday boy? "
"Daphne: Oh, he's getting all dolled up for his lady friend. You should see how excited he is. "
"Frasier: Not half as excited as he's going to be when he sees these new "
"videotapes: twelve cassettes of the history of World War II "
"Niles: For those who thought the original was fun but too short "
"Frasier: Well, this year I thought what the hell? Get him something he really wants rather than what I think he needs. "
"Niles: A very commendable sentiment. "
"Daphne: What did you get him? "
"Niles: An Armani tux. Well, my banquet's coming up. "
"Martin: Hey, Niles. "
"Daphne: Ooh. Don't you look dapper? "
"Martin: Well, thanks. Yeah, I heard the door – I thought maybe it was Sherry. "
"Niles: Oh, I thought we were joining her and your chums down at the restaurant. "
"Martin: Yeah, I changed my mind. You know, I just thought that... I'm just so anxious for you to meet her, I know you're gonna love her. No, no, forget I said that. I mean, you will but I just don't want to jinx it. Oh, there it is. Frasier, answer the door, would you? No, no, wait a minute. I'll get it. "
"Sherry: Happy Birthday "
"Martin: Come in and meet the family. "
"Sherry: Hi Sherry Dempsey. Now Marty didn't tell me the two of you were so handsome [she bearhugs Niles who forces a smile] "
"Daphne: Hello. Daphne Moon. "
"Sherry: Ooh – the physical therapist. Don't worry about me, honey. I'm not the jealous type. Anybody that keeps my Marty limber is aces in my book. "
"Martin: Hey, sit down, Sherry. Come on. You know Fras, Sherry is a big fan of your show. "
"Sherry: Oh yes, a big fan. Well, as a matter of fact when my friend Donna's marriage was on the rocks, you were the one that she called for advice. "
"Frasier: Really? And did my advice prove helpful? "
"Sherry: That's not important. You cared. That's what matters. "
"Daphne: Can we offer you a drink? "
"Sherry: Well, actually, since it's a special occasion I brought some bubbly. Let's crack it open [throws the bottle at Niles who just manages to catch it] "
"Niles: Yes, why not? Oh look Frasier – Cold Duck. "
"Sherry: You ever had it? "
"Frasier: Just once "
"Daphne: I'll do the honours. "
"Sherry: Ooh, I love this apartment. Wow, that's some view you've got. "
"Frasier: Thank you. "
"Sherry: Which room's mine? "
"Sherry: Gotcha "
"Martin: She's always doing stuff like that. "
"Sherry: Oh, I love making people laugh. To me humour is like medicine. "
"Niles: Guess we're in the placebo group. "
"Frasier: So... Dad tells me you two kids met at McGinty's. "
"Sherry: That's right. I tend bar there. Saw your Dad there one night looking kind of lonesome and I said to myself... "
"Daphne: Bottoms up "
"Sherry: Well, something like that. "
"Daphne: Here we go. Well, Happy Birthday. "
"Sherry: Through the lips and over the gums... "
"Frasier: Look out, tastebuds, here it comes. "
"Sherry: I never heard that version. "
"Sherry: I better be careful. Two glasses of that and I'd be dancing on the tables. "
"Martin: Yeah. You know, Sherry used to be on the stage. "
"Frasier: On Broadway? "
"Sherry: Las Vegas. Ever been there? "
"Frasier: Just once "
"Sherry: What a town, huh? Great food, terrific theatre, just too darn easy to get married. You're separated, right? "
"Niles: Yes. "
"Sherry: I've been there. Listen, you want my advice? "
"Niles: Well... "
"Sherry: Don't mope Get right back in the saddle. My Mum always used to say to me, 'Honey, the only way to get over someone is to get under someone.' "
"Sherry: Well, Momma had lots of sayings like that. "
"Niles: I didn't know Mae West had children. "
"Martin: Well, hey, we better be going, so if you want to freshen up you better do it now. It's right down there. "
"Daphne: I'll show you the way. "
"Sherry: I know what you're doing here. You just want the reviews. Talk me up. "
"Martin: That's not it at all. You think you're so smart. [turning to Frasier and Niles] Well, what do you think? "
"Frasier: Er... Wow. "
"Martin: Niles? "
"Niles: Er... I see that Wow and raise you a Zowie. "
"Martin: I'm so glad you like her. You really do, right? "
"Frasier: Yes, Dad. "
"Niles: Absolutely. "
"Martin: That's it, great Well, you know we're going to have to spend more time here. You know, she's got that fourth floor walk-up and its murder on my hip. Not that I wouldn't climb the Space Needle to hear her play that banjo of hers. "
"Sherry: Come on, boys. She's back. "
"Daphne: You know, I keep meaning to "
"ask: what's that lovely perfume you're wearing? "
"Frasier: Yes, I've been wondering that myself. "
"Sherry: It's called Milady's Boudoir. [heading out the door followed by Martin and Daphne] You wouldn't believe what a bargain it is. For a hundred bucks I could buy enough to drown myself in. "
"Niles: I've got sixty "
"TO: "
"Niles: Again, I'm sorry for not making it over for dinner last night, but you know I had this tickle in my throat... "
"Frasier: Spare me your lame excuses, Niles. We both know why you weren't there. "
"Niles: How was Sherry? "
"Frasier: Colourful as ever. Last night she treated us to a selection from her unpublished volume of Limericks for Lovers. The last several were about a well-travelled man fortuitously named Horatio "
"Niles: Oh, dear God. Don't turn around. "
"Frasier: Who is it? "
"Niles: It's Dad, and he's brought Sophie Tucker "
"Frasier: Oh God. But this is our place. "
"Niles: Don't look. "
"Sherry: Hey How ya doing? Look who's here. Wow, what a cute place this is. I walk by here all the time and never stopped in. "
"Martin: Yeah, well the boys love it here. "
"Sherry: Well, we should start coming here. Now, make room at that table. We'll be right back. We're gonna get a cuppa. "
"Frasier: Quick Niles, pull up the ladder. She found our clubhouse "
"Niles: This cannot go on. "
"Frasier: You're right. Dad has to be politely told that even though he may enjoy her company he has no right to... what's the polite word for inflict? "
"Niles: Well, I don't know, but I'm sure you'll find one. "
"Frasier: Me? I have to do this alone? I thought the two of us would sit him down and talk to him... "
"Niles: No, no, no. "
"Frasier: ...both of us. "
"Niles: No, no. I'm afraid you're the one who's going to be making that little speech. "
"Frasier: But Niles, both of us have a problem. "
"Niles: Ah, ah, ah, ah. She's not invading my apartment. I can afford to be patient. "
"Frasier: You are a little weasel, aren't you? "
"Niles: A little weasel whose Daddy loves him. "
"Sherry: Niles, before I forget. About your banquet - are we talking fancy-schmancy? "
"Niles: Well, it's not exactly the way it's worded on the invitation, but yes... Why? [sits back down] "
"Martin: Well, Daphne's got a cold so Sherry's going to use her ticket. "
"Frasier: What fun That's coming up soon, isn't it? Maybe you should start working on that little speech. "
"Sherry: So, fancy dress, huh? Good. I got a backwards leopard skin number that's gonna knock your eyes out. "
"Martin: Gotcha "
"Sherry: Oh, I'm sorry. I'm smushing you. "
"Frasier: No, that's all right. We were just leaving. "
"Sherry: Oh, you gotta go? Well Niles, don't worry about your banquet. I'll wear a nice dress and put on my best dancing shoes. "
"Niles: Oh, well, there won't be dancing. "
"Sherry: You just leave that to Sherry "
"Frasier: Well, your little banquet should prove quite amusing. I hope Dr. Geudfreund doesn't aggravate his hernia when he goes underneath the limbo pole "
"Niles: I have to talk to Dad. I can't let her ruin the most important evening of my life. What do I say to him? Frasier, you've got to help me. "
"Frasier: Well... prepared though you were to abandon me and let me handle all the dirty work alone, I will swallow my resentment, confront him with you tonight and take my share of the heat. "
"Niles: Thank you. "
"Frasier: Gotcha "
"Martin: So Niles, what are you in the mood for? Normandy or The Battle of the Bulge? "
"Niles: Whatever. "
"Martin: You've been fidgeting around all night. Something on your mind? "
"Niles: Ah, yes actually. It's about my awards banquet. "
"Martin: Yeah? "
"Niles: Dad, this is very difficult to say. I would really rather you didn't... wear those pants. "
"Martin: Well, I'm not. I'm wearing that Avanti tux you gave me. What's your problem? "
"Niles: I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I guess, I don't know, I'm just nervous about tomorrow night. God knows why. "
"Frasier: Evening, Dad. "
"Martin: Evening. "
"Frasier: Something wrong? "
"Martin: You know, that brother of yours can be downright insulting. He's so afraid that someone's going to embarrass him at his fancy dinner. "
"Frasier: Er... you know, Niles told me about what he was going to say to you tonight. And well, I must say that, in his defense, it is an important evening for him and well, let's face it, Sherry can be a bit much. "
"Martin: She can, huh? "
"Frasier: Well, I don't mean it as a criticism, mind you. Some people like that. But now that Niles has broached the subject I must say that I too find Sherry a bit brassy and flamboyant... He didn't say a word to you, did he? "
"Martin: I don't believe this. You got a problem with Sherry? "
"Niles: That delightful woman? "
"Frasier: Oh, knock it off I see you're still waiting on that spine donor Dad, there is no reason to belabour this point... "
"Martin: No, no. You got something to say, let's hear it. You don't like her? "
"Frasier: Please understand, Dad, as happy as we are that you've found someone... "
"Martin: But you don't like her? "
"Niles: No, no. We're not saying that. She's just not the sort of person that we would normally choose to spend time with. "
"Martin: In other words, you don't like her? Come on, we're all grown-ups here. Tell me the truth. "
"Frasier: All right, Dad, we don't like her. "
"Martin: Fine That's the way you feel about it? Don't worry, I won't bring her back here any more. I guess it's too much to expect my own family to make a person I care about feel welcome "
"Frasier: WAIT A MINUTE When did you ever make any of the women we were involved with feel welcome? "
"Niles: Ooh Frasier, you're right He almost got away with that "
"Frasier: When did Lilith ever set foot in your house that you didn't make her feel as wanted as a fungus? "
"Niles: Yes, not to mention my Maris "
"Martin: You're comparing a warm lady like Sherry to Frosty the Snow- Wife? "
"Frasier: There That is exactly what I'm talking about. Oh, why don't we just face facts? I mean, since when has any of us ever - from Sherry to Lilith to Maris to Diane - has ever been able to pick one woman that the other two could stand the sight of? "
"Martin: I picked your mother "
"Frasier: I'm sorry, Niles. I've been hogging the floor. "
"Niles: Er... "
"Martin: Ah, forget it. You're right. Why should I expect you to make the effort when I'm no better? Hell, you probably got it from me. You sure didn't get it from your mother 'cos she was great that way. Anytime she ever met anybody she could always find something to like about them. One of the things I loved her for. It's one of the things I love Sherry for. She's a lot like your mother that way. She'll always find something – even with you two. "
"Frasier: Well, I suppose we could all afford to be a bit more open- minded when it comes to each other's mates. "
"Martin: Well, at the very least, if we can't say anything nice we shouldn't say anything at all. "
"Niles: I'll be having some quiet Thanksgivings, but fine with me. "
"Frasier: Hi, Sherry "
"Niles: Hi. "
"Frasier: Don't you look nice? Come on in. "
"Sherry: Well, thank you, Frasier. Oh Marty, I brought you one more little gift. "
"Martin: Another one? "
"Sherry: Well, I wanted to give it to you on your birthday but it took me a while to find the right size. "
"Martin: Really? I'm usually a pretty easy fit. "
"Sherry: Who said it's for you to wear? "
"Martin: Ho-ho, I like it already. "
"Sherry: Oh, I should stop. I'm embarrassing your boys. "
"Martin: No, you're not. Is she? "
"Niles: Nooooo "
"Frasier: Party on "
"Martin: Well, I think we should go and unwrap this. "
"Frasier: Oh, Dad? Lilith mentioned that she was going to be joining Frederick on his next visit. You don't mind if she stays here, do you? "
"Martin: Oh, Lilith No, great, I love Lilith. That's terrific. She's welcome here any time. "
"Sherry: Honey, you're hurting my hand. "
"Sherry: Oh listen, I should mention I'm kind of a sleepwalker, so if you get up in the night and find me in here naked, just give me a good hard shake. I'll come to in a jiff. "
"Frasier: Got me, good one "

"Frasier: Glad you came back with us. I hope you had a good time. Well, I can’t tell you how much fun this has been. Listen, now that you know the way don’t be a stranger. OK. Good night [closes the door after the man] Who the hell was that? "
"Niles: He’s not from the station? "
"Roz: I never saw him before. "
"Daphne: He was table-hopping like crazy during the awards. "
"Martin: That’s ‘cause he was our waiter. "
"Frasier: Well, that’s the last time I say, 'everybody back to my place' "
"Bulldog: Who cares about that guy? This is a great night. "
"Roz: For you, maybe. The rest of us lost. "
"Bulldog: Hey, it’s not important whether you win or lose. It’s an honour just being nomin... I couldn’t get through that crap on stage, I can’t get through it now "
"Roz: Frasier, do you mind if I use your phone? "
"Frasier: No, not at all. Who are you calling? It’s practically midnight. "
"Roz: Oh, I promised my grandmother I’d leave her a message telling her how we did. [dials the number then starts speaking into the phone] Hey Gammy, it’s Roz. Guess what? We won again We’re all here celebrating. ' sounding "
"Roz: Listen, I gotta go. It’s getting crazy here but I’ll talk to you tomorrow. Bye-bye. "
"Niles: You lied to 'Gammy?' "
"Roz: Well, she’s old and it makes her happy. She smiled for a week when I won the Miss Seattle Pageant "
"Frasier: You know, Roz raises a very interesting philosophical question... "
"Martin: Oh, here we go. Buckle up "
"Frasier: Is it always morally wrong to lie? We are taught that it is. Though obviously there are certain occasions when a lie would be acceptable. "
"Bulldog: Yeah, like the lies you tell a chick in bed. 'You’re the best I’ve ever been with'; 'Your thighs don’t look that fat'; 'Don’t worry, I’ve had a vasectomy.' [Bulldog notes the disgusted faces around the room] Hey, screw you guys I’m an artist; we live by different rules. "
"Niles: An argument can certainly be made that a lie is good when it spares someone unnecessary pain. I’m reminded of Maris’s brief flirtation with active wear when I assured her, 'You look fine, darling. Spandex is supposed to blouse' "
"Frasier: You know, Lilith actually told me the other day that Frederick has taken to lying. Yes, he told all of his friends that Lilith is an alien. "
"Martin: Seems as good an explanation as any "
"Frasier: He also told them that she wears her hair in a bun to hide the third eye in the back of her head. "
"Roz: How did Lilith find out? "
"Frasier: Well, apparently she was driving him and Toby to a Junior Mensa meeting, she looked in the rearview mirror and saw that they were making faces at the other cars. So, never have the words 'I can see you' caused so much screaming and wetting of pants "
"Daphne: I did my fair share of fibbing too. I once told my school chums I was born with a tiny embryonic twin attached to my hip. [Daphne laughs hilariously whilst the others look slightly perturbed] Of course they were horrified and it didn’t help my social life at all. But for a while there it was nice having a sister. "
"Niles: Oh. Remember in prep school when we were so desperate to avoid The President’s Physical Fitness Test... "
"Frasier: ...that we lit a match underneath the fire alarm and all the sprinklers went off. "
"Niles: And we blamed that delinquent kid, John Rajeski. "
"Frasier: Yes. "
"Martin: You did what? "
"Frasier: What’s wrong? "
"Martin: You two swore up and down to me that you never set off that alarm. "
"Frasier: Well, of course we weren’t going to tell you. "
"Niles: For Heaven’s sake, Dad, you can’t be mad. We were kids. "
"Martin: You know, the headmaster said it was you two. I went down there and raised hell with him. I said, 'My kids don’t lie.' Because of you that Rajeski kid got expelled "
"Frasier: Expelled? If we’d have known that was going to happen we would have told the truth. "
"Niles: Not me. He was a brute and a meanie. "
"Frasier: You’re right. He used to make the most merciless fun of me, about how I always wore my gym shorts in the shower. He used to call me 'Shorts In The Shower Boy.' You don’t have to be witty to be cruel. "
"Martin: Well, I don’t give a damn what that kid did. Getting him expelled was worse. I’m going to bed. Good night, everybody. "
"Frasier: Well, I guess that brings an end to our little debate. Apparently there are no good lies. "
"Bulldog: Hey, hey, it’s getting kinda heavy in here. We gotta liven this place up, huh? Hey, I know – party games, huh? All right Doc, I’m going to need a blindfold, whipped cream and a glass coffee table. What? Nobody went to camp? "
"Roz: Forget it, Bulldog. These guys are no fun. You know what? I know a great after-hours place where we can go get a few drinks. "
"Bulldog: Now you’re talking. Hey, if things go well I know an after after-hours place. And I got the keys. "
"Roz: Mmm. You get the elevator; I’ll get my coat. "
"Bulldog: You’re on. "
"Roz: No good lies, my ass "
"Niles: Good morning, Frasier. "
"Frasier: Oh, good morning, Niles... Oh dear God – it’s finally happened. This is the thanks I get for introducing you to my personal shopper. I gave her specific instructions to write down every article of clothing that I had purchased so we could avoid this sort of calamity "
"Niles: I didn’t use Renaldo. This suit just caught my eye while I was shopping for shoes. "
"Niles: Well, why didn’t you also take my strong chin and swimmer’s build? "
"Frasier: Oh please. "
"Niles: Obviously we have to sit apart. "
"Frasier: Sit down There’s something I need to talk to you about. I doubt most people are as tuned to these things as you and I are. I’m sure they won’t even notice. "
"Waitress: I took a chance and brought you the same thing. "
"Frasier: After our conversation last night I couldn’t stop thinking about our getting John Rajeski expelled. I didn’t sleep a wink. "
"Niles: You can’t be serious? "
"Frasier: You mean it didn’t bother you? Where is your conscience? "
"Niles: Perhaps it fell into the quad - along with my hall monitor beret when John hung me from the flagpole He was going to be expelled sooner or later. You cannot guilt me into feeling bad. "
"Frasier: Yes, well, no one hated him more than I did but I still think we owe him an apology. Can I borrow your phone, Niles? "
"Niles: Certainly. You’re not going to call him? "
"Frasier: I am. "
"Niles: Are you insane? "
"Frasier: A number for a John Rajeski, please? Niles, my conscience won’t rest until the two of us have said we’re sorry. [speaking into phone] Oh yes, connect me please. "
"Niles: Leave me out of this. I’m not sorry. But don’t tell him that. And if he asks, I’m living in Italy. No, no, France. No, Italy "
"Frasier: Yes, hello. Is John Rajeski there, please? It’s an old friend... Oh, I’m terribly sorry to hear that. Thank you. Niles, it’s worse than we thought – he’s in prison. "
"Niles: Well... who’s wearing shorts in the shower now? "
"Frasier: Well, joke all you like. I still can’t help thinking this is all our fault. "
"Niles: How? "
"Frasier: Well, he was always on the cusp. Maybe he couldn’t get into another prep school. Maybe he had to go to public. Got in with the wrong crowd. Couldn’t hold on to a job. He could turn to a life of crime. "
"Niles: Frasier. Sometimes bad things happen to bad people. We did not set him on the path to prison. "
"Frasier: Yes, well until I’m sure of that fact my conscience will not rest. I have got to speak with him. Can I have the check, please? "
"Niles: You’re not going down to the jail? "
"Frasier: Yes, I am. I invite you to join me. "
"Niles: Yes, that’s a good idea, Frasier. The Crane boys going to a prison in matching outfits "
"TO: "
"John: Frasier Crane? "
"Frasier: John. "
"John: Hey. How’s it going? "
"Frasier: Well, fine. And you? "
"John: Eh... What brings you down here? "
"Frasier: Well, I don’t know if you get the alumni magazine, but I became a psychiatrist, and I’m currently conducting a study on men behind bars and how they got there... [notices John’s fists] That’s an awfully nasty bruise on your knuckles. "
"John: I caught some guy using my comb. I really hate it when people touch my stuff. "
"Niles: Oh, yes. I remember my brother Niles once sat in your chair in the cafeteria. As I recall you put him on a tray and ran him through the dishwasher. "
"John: Yeah, class clown – that was me. How is Niles, anyway? "
"Frasier: Ah, er... ah, he’s abroad now. "
"John: Really? Whoa, that must have hurt. "
"Frasier: No, no, I mean, er... yes, I suppose it did Well anyway, it would be an enormous help in my study if you could perhaps pinpoint the moment or event in your life that led you to here. "
"John: Ah, that’s easy. I’m doing time for passing a bad check. "
"Frasier: Ah. "
"John: You see, I wanted to get my wife something nice. We’re going through a rough time recently. I was scared she was going to leave me, you know? "
"Frasier: Well, that was quick and painless. We’ve identified the point where you fell off the beam. [gets up to leave] "
"John: Actually though, I was already on probation. I did some time about ten years back for driving a car that didn’t belong to me. "
"Frasier: And that was your first infraction? "
"John: Yeah. "
"Frasier: Well then, case closed, mystery solved. A young man yields to the lure of a bright and shiny car. Is there anything more tragic? "
"John: I did have a juvenile record. "
"Frasier: Apparently there is. "
"John: I got in a high school fight. "
"Frasier: You did say high school, not prep school? "
"John: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. This is way after you knew me. I went bad then. Always getting into fights. Of course I wouldn’t have been there in the first place if I hadn’t have gotten thrown out of that good school me and you were in. That had a big effect on me you know? "
"Frasier: Yes well, perhaps we could continue our backward journey through... "
"John: No, no, no. That was a bum rap. Somebody pulled the fire alarm and they blamed me for it. They said I did it but I didn’t do it. "
"Frasier: Let’s discuss your early childhood. "
"John: You know, the more I think about it, this all started the day I got thrown out of prep school. Ever since then my life’s been crap CRAP "
"Frasier: I think I have all the information I need now. "
"John: Sorry, I didn’t mean to blow like that. "
"Frasier: Well, that’s all right, John. Thank you for your time. "
"John: I got plenty of it. I’ll see you, huh? "
"Frasier: No, no, John. There’s just one more thing. [turns to the guard who’s ready to take John back] One second, please. [turns to John] There’s something I need to tell you about, something that I did in school that I’m not very proud of... "
"Prisoner: Yo, John. Sorry I touched your comb, man. "
"John: So what did you do? "
"Frasier: Er... well, I, er... I peeked over your shoulder once during an algebra quiz. "
"John: And I’m the one who gets expelled? "
"Daphne: Evening, Dr. Crane "
"Niles: Hello, Daphne, Dad. "
"Daphne: Something wrong with your back? "
"Niles: I injured it this morning playing squash. I had to make a dive to save match point. "
"Daphne: Well, I’ve got just the thing to take care of that. You take off your jacket, I’ll be right back. "
"Niles: You’re too kind. You know, I should never even have attempted a move like that. It was sort of a cross between a pirouette and a flying scissor kick. "
"Martin: You hurt yourself adjusting the seat in your Mercedes again, didn’t you? "
"Niles: Quiet "
"Daphne: All right, pull out your shirttails and lay facedown on the sofa. I can guarantee you within a minute you’ll be feeling much better. [Niles lies down and mutters a moan of satisfaction] I haven’t even touched you yet "
"Niles: I started without you. "
"Martin: Hey, wait a minute. You’re not gonna use that stuff on him, are you? She used it on me one time, it burned like hell "
"Daphne: Oh, hush up, old man. It helped you, didn’t it? "
"Martin: It nearly killed me "
"Daphne: Listen to the big tough policeman. You don’t hear your son complaining, do we, Dr. Crane? "
"Niles: Not a bit Frost me like a cake "
"Martin: Well, just wait a minute. It goes on cool but it then it turns into a blowtorch. "
"Daphne: Well, I guess now we know who the real man in the family is, don’t we? "
"Niles: I should say we d... Ooh "
"Daphne: Is it starting to warm up? "
"Niles: Ahh, yeah It’s a... refreshing heat, like those towels they give you on the airplane. [clearly feigning pleasure] Whoooo "
"Daphne: I’m not hurting you, am I? "
"Niles: No, no. I’m just a little ticklish back there. "
"Martin: Well, I guess you are the tough one "
"Daphne: There you go. "
"Martin: Oh, no, wait a minute, Daphne – you missed a big spot right there. "
"Niles: No, that’s OK Because it’s all done now Thank you, Daphne A few minutes ago I was bent over in pain, [rushes for the kitchen bounding over the coffee table] but now look at me, I’m running "
"Daphne: How is that hip of yours, anyway? "
"Martin: Back off, witch woman "
"Daphne: Evening, Dr. Crane. "
"Frasier: Evening, Daphne. "
"Martin: How did you get on at the jail? "
"Frasier: Horribly The man is convinced that getting thrown out of prep school was the beginning of his life of crime. "
"Martin: Been thinking that all these years? "
"Frasier: No. I sort of connected the dots for him "
"Martin: You tell him it was you? "
"Frasier: I intended to, but I became convinced that the man would be willing to perform unspeakable atrocities on the responsible party or parties. "
"Martin: Well, you probably made the right call. Knowing you, you’d beat yourself up worse than he would anyway. "
"Niles: I hope you remembered to tell him I was an expatriate. "
"Frasier: I told him you were an ex-something. You know, I just feel so guilty. I have done this man a terrible injustice. "
"Daphne: You know, Dr. Crane, I’ve always believed life has a way of balancing itself out. Yes, you may have treated this man unfairly, but think of all the people you’ve helped on your show. Just yesterday you reconciled that couple on the brink of divorce and today you helped Molly from Tacoma overcome her addiction to Swedes. "
"Frasier: That was sweets, not Swedes "
"Daphne: I thought it was strange when you told her to limit herself to one or two after meals. "
"Frasier: You know, perhaps I just have an overactive conscience. It’s not enough that I help other people, I want to help this man. "
"Niles: Well, I hope you do, Frasier because then finally you’ll stop torturing the rest of us with all your... [bends over and suddenly cries out in agony] Oh, pain’s back "
"Martin: Not to worry. She’s got more liniment. "
"Niles: Oh, pain’s gone "
"Daphne: Come on now. Be brave. Let’s go into the loo and I’ll give you a second coat. "
"Frasier: You know, Dad, Daphne gave me a thought. I’m a skilled couples' therapist. John did mention that he was having marital problems... "
"Martin: Oh, Jeez "
"Frasier: No, no, Dad. This is perfect, this is perfect. I may have ruined the last 25 years of this man’s life but with my gift I could save the next 25. Yes, a listing for a John Rajeski, please. "
"Martin: I’m telling you, Frasier, don’t get mixed up with this guy. He’s a felon. "
"Frasier: Dad, just relax, please – I know what I’m doing. [speaks into the phone] Mrs. Rajeski? Hello, you don’t know me but I’m... "
"Frasier: Why - well, that’s remarkable. Yes, I am a friend of your husband’s "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Mrs. Rajeski? "
"Susan: Wow, it’s really you – Frasier Crane "
"Frasier: May I? "
"Susan: Oh gosh, I’m sorry. Please, please come in. [Frasier walks in] You know, you’re kind of like a God at work. [Frasier looks a bit humbled] Please, please sit down. "
"Frasier: Thank you. Let me cut right to the chase. John told me that you two were going through a bit of a rough patch and I was wondering if there was anything I could do to help? "
"Susan: Well, I love John. I really do, but there is a problem. It’s just a little difficult talking about it, you know? I mean, it’s a little embarrassing – especially face-to-face. "
"Frasier: Well, I'll tell you what. Just pretend I’m on my radio show, and now you’re just another caller. "
"Susan: OK. Well, Dr. Crane, it’s a sexual problem. "
"Frasier: Ah. "
"Susan: You see, I can only get really turned on when there’s something that makes the whole situation sort of dangerous. "
"Frasier: Dangerous? "
"Susan: You’re looking at me. "
"Frasier: Sorry. "
"Susan: Like doing it in a car. "
"Frasier: Well, that’s not so dangerous. "
"Susan: You must be some driver. "
"Frasier: Oh. And you’ve never had an accident? "
"Susan: No, I’m on the pill "
"Frasier: So how long have you had this particular kink? "
"Susan: Well, I don’t know really. It kind of started around the time that I first met John. I was working in a convenience store, I caught him shoplifting. Next thing I knew we were rolling around on the Slurpy machine and I’d already pressed the silent alarm so I knew that the cops were on their way... "
"Susan: That’s when I realised what really turns me on - knowing I could get caught at any moment. "
"Frasier: Oh, Dear God He’s out of jail, isn’t he? "
"Susan: He could walk in at any time. "
"Frasier: He’ll kill us "
"Susan: Ooh, touch me here and say that. "
"Frasier: ARE YOU CRAZY? He doesn’t even let people touch his comb "
"Susan: I know. What’s that all about? "
"Frasier: You might like to put your dress back on, straighten up before he gets home. "
"John: Open up. "
"Frasier: You only have time for one – I suggest the dress. Where’s the bedroom? "
"Susan: You’re in it. "
"Frasier: Listen, you’ve got to get him out of here. "
"Susan: And pass the chance to have sex with him knowing he could find you here at any minute? "
"Susan: Welcome home, baby "
"John: What are you doing? "
"Susan: Well, I’m just getting ready for you. Oh, I missed you. So, do you want to? "
"John: Sure I do, but, er... you mean normally. The super’s not going to barge in? You didn’t dial 911 or anything like that? "
"Susan: I’ve got everything I need right here in this room. "
"John: I’m just going to pull down the shades. [heads for the shades, which are next to the sofa] "
"Susan: Wait, wait "
"John: What the hell is this? "
"John: How much did you spend on these? "
"Susan: Oh, Johnny, can’t we talk about that later? "
"John: Why don’t you turn off the light? "
"Susan: It’s too dark. I want to see you. "
"John: Whatever you want, baby. This is going to be great. I am going to make love to you all night. "
"John: But first, I have a surprise for you. I wrote a poem for you while I was in prison. [takes out a piece of paper and begins reading] 'I am a garden, dry and brown. You are the rain that tumbles down, Susan. I am a beggar that needs to eat, you are a sandwich thick with meat, Susan.' "
"John: Oh my God. I knew you had something planned – you set the building on fire "
"Susan: No I didn’t, I swear. "
"John: Come on, let’s get out of here. "
"Susan: Oh, but the firemen – they’re on their way. "
"John: Come on "

"Daphne: Well, I'm off to get our lunch. Any special requests? "
"Sherry: Oh, no, no, no, anything you pick you will be fine. "
"Daphne: Okay, then. Back in a bit. "
"Sherry: She is such a doll. You are such a doll "
"Sherry: I thought she'd never leave "
"Martin: I know. It's nice to have some time alone finally. "
"Sherry: Oh, isn't it? "
"Martin: Come here, you. "
"Martin: Hey, get your own. Now, come on now, get away, come on. Come with me, come on, Eddie. Come on. "
"Martin: There you go. Seat's already up for you. It's happy hour Where were we? "
"Sherry: Oh, come here, you little devil, you. "
"Daphne: Well, look who was just coming home with take-out from the gourmet shop. "
"Sherry: Boys, hi. Don't you look handsome in your best bib and tucker. Come and give Aunt Sherry a great big kiss "
"Niles: Perhaps just a friendly wave from across the room. "
"Sherry: Niles, you are so shy. Thank God your big brother isn't. Now come on, Fras, plant one on me. "
"Frasier: Has Eddie been licking you? "
"Sherry: Yes. "
"Frasier: Yes, yes, I thought your perfume had a hint of sausage in it. "
"Sherry: So, you two've been shopping? "
"Frasier: Well, antiquing actually. I just found the most exquisite Japanese door knocker, it's said to bring peace and tranquility to any home it adorns. "
"Sherry: Oh, I haven't seen any decent oriental knocker since 'Emperor Charles's Shanghai revue' "
"Martin: Isn't she great? She is as funny as she is classy "
"Niles: No argument there Oh, by the way, if you want someone to install that for you, I can put you in touch with my ex- houseman, Guy. "
"Frasier: Guy? "
"Niles: No, Guy "
"Frasier: Guy? "
"Niles: No, back of the throat, Guy. "
"Frasier: Oh, what's the difference? Also, heavens, I can install a simple door knocker on my own. "
"Martin: You probably need a screwdriver. "
"Frasier: That's exactly what I was about to get. "
"Martin: It's in the tool drawer. "
"Martin: The drawer under that big tea server thing. "
"Frasier: Dad, that is a Byelorussian samovar My God, how long have you lived here? "
"Daphne: Here we are. Lunch is ready. "
"Sherry: Oh, actually, hon, I just remembered I've got an errand I gotta run before I get to work. Goodbye, Niles. Don't worry, I'm not going to kiss you, I know it embarrasses you. Wait, come here, you've got some schmutz on your cheek. "
"Sherry: My mistake, it's a mole, you might want to have that checked. "
"Niles: Oh, I think now I'll just play it safe and have it removed. "
"Frasier: Oh, Daphne, you know, apparently this morning when you were dusting, you forgot this object does not face front but rather askew. "
"Daphne: I'm so sorry, Dr. Crane, I should never have tried to do it without that diagram you drew me. "
"Sherry: Oh, Frasier, now that I know you like antiques, I've got a little present at home for you. It's a lamp, shaped like two frogs kissing and when you turn it on, their hearts glow. When would you like me to bring it by? "
"Niles: Preferably when I'm here. "
"Sherry: I'll bring it with me tomorrow. Bye-bye. "
"Frasier: Daphne, would you bring me the hammer? "
"Daphne: I thought you just needed a screwdriver for your door knocker. "
"Frasier: Well, I do, I just want to be prepared for when that froggy lamp gets here. "
"Sherry: I'll see you later, honey, I'll call you. "
"Martin: Okay, bye. "
"Martin: Oh, hi there, Mrs. Langer. "
"Langer: Ms "
"Martin: Oh, right, Ms... "
"Martin: Ms...erable cow Niles, tonight's your opera night, isn't it? "
"Niles: Yes. Why? "
"Martin: Well, I was just wondering. You know, I'd love to cook a nice romantic dinner for Sherry but I can't do it at her place because I'm allergic to her cats and there is no privacy around here. "
"Niles: Say no more, Dad. My bachelor pad is the perfect place to entertain a young lady. Just remember, always use coasters, no snacking in the carpeted areas and close the art books after viewing so you don't crease the spine "
"Frasier: I think they have the same rules at the 'Playboy Mansion.' "
"Frasier: Oh, it's on, that's fast. Huh, that's not so hard. You know, tomorrow morning I think I may just have to attack that leaking sink in the powder room. "
"glare: "
"Daphne: Oh, sorry, I thought that was a joke. "
"Frasier: Ah The inaugural knock. "
"Frasier: Oh, what's this? 'Your unauthorised door knocker violates the condo by-laws regarding hallway decoration. Remove it immediately.' "
"Daphne: Oh, that's one of Mrs. Langer's no-no slips. I can't stand that woman. Just because she's president of the condo board she acts like this building's her kingdom. Everything has to be done exactly the way she likes it. "
"Frasier: Yes, well, Daphne, nobody hates a bossy fussbudget more than I do but... Daphne, askew, askew But, rules are there for reason. I was obviously at fault for not getting approval before I hung it up there. "
"Niles: I did notice a sign in the lobby about some condo board meeting tonight if you want to present your case. "
"Frasier: Oh, perfect. We live in a democratic system and I will work within it. I'm sure I can persuade them with my charm and eloquence. "
"Daphne: I don't know, those people can be very difficult. "
"Frasier: Oh, pish-tosh It's not as though I'll be addressing the Supreme Court, I'll simply be talking to the board "
"Martin: Well, they will be by the time he gets though "
"Langer: After careful consideration of the bids from a number of gardeners, we have decided to go with Jordan landscaping. "
"Frasier: Excuse me, I'm not too late, am I? I was hoping to make a statement. "
"Molly: Me too. They will be getting to new business soon, fortunately. "
"Frasier: Good, good. I have a matter of some importance. "
"Molly: Oh, well then you should go before me. "
"Frasier: Oh, well, thank you. Why are you here? "
"Molly: I'm going to ask them to make the ramp outside the building less steep, so I don't keep rolling into traffic. "
"Frasier: Oh, well, er, perhaps you should go first. "
"Langer: Is that Frasier Crane talking while I'm talking? "
"Frasier: Well, yes, I'm sorry, Ms. Langer. I was just inquiring as to whether I was too late to raise some new business. "
"Langer: Well, we were just about to get to that. Why don't you go ahead? "
"Frasier: Ah, earlier today, I installed a new door knocker without your permission. Now, I'd like to say in my defense that my over- eagerness was not out of disrespect but rather enthusiasum for the door knocker, which I'm sure you will agree is really quite beautiful. I understand the rule exists to prohibit people from putting eyesores in public places, but I ask you, should it apply to something as beautiful as this? [hands some pictures out to audience] Here, if you will please. Something, which only serves to elevate our spirits. Let's just say somebody passes by my door, sees the knocker and suddenly feels just a little bit better without even knowing why. That same person passes a perfect stranger and smiles - who in turn... reaches down and picks up, perhaps, a piece of trash; plants a garden, volunteers at a soup kitchen? Like little ripples on a still pond, the happiness spreads. What I'm asking to do, think of this not simply as an ornament but rather an opportunity, dare I say it, of knocking on the door of a new, more civilised world. Thank you. "
"Langer: Allow us just a moment. "
"Frasier: Of course. "
"Langer: Request denied You must remove the knocker within twenty- four hours, despite the consequences to world peace. "
"Frasier: I appreciate your... "
"Langer: Are you still talking? Your request is denied Sit down "
"Frasier: But there has been no discussion, it hasn't even been opened up to the floor. "
"Langer: I will entertain suggestions from the floor if anyone has any idea how to shut this man up "
"Frasier: Forget it I came down here expecting a fair hearing in the democratic tradition, but here you "
"are: a tyrant more concerned with the exercise of power than with justice Well, I will leave now taking solace in the certain knowledge that in time, you, Ms. Langer, will join all tyrants on the ash-heap of history "
"Frasier: I'm not here. "
"Frasier: You know, I'll just get those later. "
"TO: "
"Man: Dr. Crane. "
"Frasier: Yes. Who's there? "
"Man: A friend. Ah, keep your distance. "
"Frasier: Why can't I see you? "
"Man: That's not important right now. What's important is that you were not afraid to go up against Ms. Langer last night. "
"Frasier: Without much success. "
"Man: More than you know. Those people in the building are afraid of her. There is a group of us who fight her though, a small- but-determined band of resistors. You know the doormat by the service elevator? We did that "
"Frasier: It's very nice. "
"Man: We would like you to be our candidate to go up against her in the upcoming elections. "
"Frasier: Well, I'm very flattered, but you see... "
"Man: You are our only chance, Dr. Crane, and she must be defeated. She is evil Heckles in 1704 was two days late with his condo fee and she lowered the water pressure in his shower. Eventually he died. "
"Frasier: Of bad water pressure? "
"Man: No, I think it was a hunting accident. But he spent his last months on this earth unable to get all the conditioner out of his hair. Only you posses the charisma and courage to defeat her. "
"Frasier: Well, that may be, but, er... "
"Man: I am not asking you to decide right now. I just want you to say you'll think about it. "
"Frasier: All right, but why can't I see who you are? "
"Man: Because I'm remodeling my bathroom If she found out I was talking to you, she would never approve my bidet. Just think of me as 'Mr. X' "
"Frasier: That would work better without the vanity plates, Dr. Dorfman "
"Niles: Frasier, wait. "
"Frasier: Oh, hello, Niles. You know, Niles, the most extraordinary thing just happened to me down at the garage. "
"Niles: Excuse me... is Dad home now? "
"Frasier: Yes, as far as I know. "
"Niles: I was afraid of that. "
"Frasier: Why? Is something wrong? "
"Niles: Well, last night I invited Dad to use my apartment for a quiet, romantic dinner with Sherry while I attended 'La Traviata.' Well, the production was just dreadful. In 'Opoir Selor Oui,' the soprano couldn't hit the E flat above high C to save her life I was so fed up I stormed out, drove home, entered my apartment and when I saw what Dad and Sherry were doing there, I hit the note myself "
"Frasier: You mean they were... "
"Niles: They were "
"Frasier: Oh What did you do? "
"Niles: Pulled up a chaise lounge and took out my opera glasses, what do you think I did? I slammed the door and ran away. I've never been so embarrassed. "
"Frasier: Oh Niles, you simply have to diffuse the entire subject with simple, adult conversation. I don't want to re-create what happened to Maris and me after the cabin incident when I walked in on her taking a shower. Oh God, months of avoidance and awkwardness. "
"Niles: Excuse me? You saw my Maris completely naked? "
"Frasier: Oh, don't fret, Niles, it was really nothing more than a fleeting glance in a very steamy bathroom. More like glimpsing a birch sapling through a thick fog. "
"Niles: Life is so unfair You get a vision of my Maris, I get a big eyefull of Dad "
"Frasier: Well, I'd say we hit about the same level on the 'Yikes' meter "
"Frasier: Oh Roz, you're here. "
"Roz: Is that your idea of an apology for making me work on a Saturday and then getting here late? "
"Frasier: I was detained. "
"Frasier: Roz, the most extraordinary thing happened. I was down at the parking garage, when suddenly I was blinded by a set of headlights. A mysterious man crept from the shadows and told me I should run for condo board president. "
"Roz: You've been at your wine club, haven't you? "
"Frasier: No. This really happened. "
"Niles: Surely you're not actually thinking of running? You've never held an elected office in your life. "
"Frasier: Are you forgetting I served two terms back in high school as grand panem tandrum of the vocabulary club "
"Roz: Listen, Frasier, this job is a nightmare. Trust me, I know. Like if somebody wants a garbage disposal, they'll bug you day and night, they'll leave kitchen scraps in your mailbox until they get what they want. "
"Frasier: Have you served on a condo board? "
"Roz: No, but I have a brand new garbage disposal. "
"Daphne: Hello, all. "
"Niles: Let me help you with those. "
"Daphne: Thanks. I've had to lug these things five blocks. This morning, Mrs. Langer gave me one of those no-no slips for parking in the same vacant space I've been using for years. "
"Frasier: God, I'm sorry, Daphne, I'm afraid this is my fault. Ms. Langer's simply retaliated against me. You see, last night I rather humiliated her in a dazzling display of rhetoric "
"Daphne: I heard you spilled your briefcase all over the floor. "
"Frasier: You know, this building has a grapevine Ernest & Julio Gallo would envy You know, perhaps I should run against Ms. Langer. God knows, she's ripe for a good comeuppance "
"Daphne: Oh, I know exactly what you mean, Dr. Crane. I was standing behind her in the elevator the other day, looking at the back of her head and I thought, you know, several stout whacks with a tire iron and this building would be a much happier place I'll just get these bags off to the kitchen. "
"Niles: Frasier, this Langer woman sounds as if she wields considerable power. What if you run against her and lose? "
"Roz: I'm with Niles, let somebody else do it. "
"Frasier: What an appalling expression of apathy. What kind of a world do you think this would be if everyone thought the way you two do? "
"Roz: Everyone does think the way we do. "
"Frasier: And look at the kind of world it is Corruption in high places, illiterates unconcerned with the real issues because they are too consumed with the same selfish pleasures "
"Niles: Is this eclair spoken for? "
"Frasier: It's mine, put it back Where will this all lead? The point is, if you're not willing to get involved then you have no right to grumble when things don't go your way. "
"Martin: Look at this. I've got two slips for not taking Eddie in the freight elevator. It's ridiculous, everybody uses the main elevator. Mrs. Tortwurst has her dog, Fluffy, in there all the time. "
"Frasier: Oh, that's it, I am running for condo board president. The time comes in every man's life when he must meet face to face with a challenge, rather than skitter away like a coward. "
"Martin: Well, I'm proud of you son, that's a way a Crane talks "
"TO: "
"Daphne: Okay, Eddie, now. "
"Daphne: Good boy, Eddie. Now, go make dinner. "
"Daphne: It's just a little joke Eddie and I have been working on. "
"Frasier: Too bad, it explains so much. [looks at a no-no slip on the side] What is this? Another one? "
"Daphne: Oh, yes, it seems your father got it last night. I guess he's just refusing to take Eddie in the freight elevator. Of course, all of that will be different once you're elected. "
"Frasier: Yes, but we don't want to jinx it, Daphne. I must say, I think my chances are very good after this epistle I found this morning on my windshield. It's from the Resistance "
"Daphne: 'Dear Dr. Crane, we have polled the building. The election is yours, good work. Signed, Anonymous.' But wouldn't this be more anonymous if it didn't say, 'from the desk of Dr. William M. Dorfman'? "
"Frasier: Yes, well, now you see why they need me. With this lead aside, I still wish I had a punchier opening for this speech I wrote this morning. Well, I'm running out of time. Unless, yes... I think Ms. Langer may have given me the very ammunition I need for my opening salvo. We'll just see how the voters feel about a woman who tries to persecute a disabled ex-policeman and his loyal old dog. "
"Daphne: You know, it will be nice to live a building where anyone can hang whatever they damn well please on their door "
"Frasier: Of course Well, pending my approval. "
"Martin: Is he gone? "
"Daphne: Well, yes. You're not avoiding him, are you? "
"Martin: Well, yeah, kind of. I mean, it's pretty embarrassing about getting caught last night in that hot tub and then the whole building's talking about it. "
"Daphne: Well, what happened? "
"Martin: You haven't heard? "
"Daphne: No. "
"Martin: Oh Well... never mind "
"Daphne: No, no, no, no, what? "
"Martin: Well, after dinner last night my hip was getting kinda stiff so I went down to the hot tub. Well, you know how it is when you kick up the jets and your trunks fill up like a hot air balloon. "
"Daphne: No, but go on. "
"Martin: Well, there was nobody about so I just slipped out of them and tossed them on the deck. "
"Daphne: You mean you were...? "
"Martin: Yeah, just floatin' free. So, I was sitting there minding my own business, you know, and letting the bubbles do their work and suddenly old lady Langer shows up. She sees my trunks and she writes me out a no-no slip right there and then. "
"Daphne: You mean the no-no slip was for being naked in the hot tub? "
"Martin: Yeah. "
"Daphne: Oh, I told Dr. Crane it was because you took Eddie in the elevator. Oh, dear, I've got to get down to that condo meeting. "
"Martin: Why? "
"Daphne: Well, I don't know what's going on down there but suddenly I have a very queasy feeling "
"Martin: Just what Ms. Langer said when she tossed me my trunks. "
"Langer: So, you can vote for me - a person who has worked this past year to keep this building running smoothly - or you can turn the building over to a man who can scarcely keep his own family under control. Thank you. "
"Frasier: Hello, condo owners. I'm sorry my opponent has chosen to be vindictive about my family, but that is merely characteristic of her behaviour during her entire term in office. How else would one explain this? [brings out no-no slip] This citation my father received last night is a perfect example of the prejudice that this woman is capable of. "
"Langer: We are all aware of your father's behaviour last night. I'm surprised you're not too afraid to bring it up. "
"Frasier: Ashamed? Not at all I defend his behaviour So he had his little friend out where he shouldn't be. So what? He's been doing it for years "
"Langer: You approve of his behaviour? "
"Frasier: Approve? I applaud it Have you no compassion? My father is getting older, hasn't many pleasures left in life. I can't tell you the hours of joy that that little guy has brought him And not just him. Who among us can't help but break into a smile upon seeing the little fella? Oh, I know, you know, sometimes it is irksome when his little Eddie appears at any inopportune moments, but... "
"Langer: He's named it Eddie? "
"Frasier: Well, 'Eddie''s, of course, not a name I might have chose. I might have gone with something a bit more - oh, I don't know, whimsical like, er, oh... Puck "
"Frasier: You know, the clodsom sprite from Shakespeare's 'A Midsummer Night's Dream.' Don't look so shocked Whom does it really harm if he unleashes Eddie once in a while? Come on, it's not as though he's alone in this beheviour. Mrs. Tortwurst, I've seen you do the same thing many times with your Fluffy. You know, if you ask me, not only is this behaviour harmless, it's laudable. Why, you should see the looks on the faces of the schoolchildren when he takes Eddie out to the playground. "
"Frasier: On the other hand... we all need rules. Go Go Go "
"Frasier: Oh, and sorry about the knocker. "

"Frasier: Roz? None of these lights seem to be flashing. "
"Roz: Hey, what do you know, I got the same thing over here. "
"Frasier: Well, who's our first caller? "
"Roz: No-one. "
"Frasier: Well, how much time do we have? "
"Roz: None. "
"Frasier: Hello Seattle, this is Dr. Frasier Crane. Well, I have some good news for you. As today is the first sunny day we've had in a few weeks, it seems that all our lines are open. So please call in, no waiting. Absolutely no waiting Oh come on, somebody's marriage must be on the skids. Somebody's career must be going badly, other than mine Hey, how about all you agoraphobics, I know you're not outside Oh, there's a call I'll take it, I'll take it. Hello, I'm listening. "
"Alice: Hi Dr. Crane, my name is Alice and I'm usually a happy person but today, well, I just started thinking about all kinds of sad things. My job isn't that exciting, my kids don't call me... pretty soon I was in a full-blown funk. "
"Frasier: Well, Alice, as today seems to be a bit slow I think I have a story I can tell you that might be of some help. Do you have some time? "
"Alice: Well, it's three 'o clock and I'm still in my bathrobe. "
"Frasier: Perfect Well, it started three days ago. You see, my father was very concerned about his little dog, Eddie. So, he had to take him to the vet... "
"TO: "
"Roz: So what's the doctor say? "
"Martin: He's stumped. I told him, he's not sleeping, he's not eating, he's not even sniffing stuff. "
"Frasier: Welcome news to Mrs. Frobisher in 13-B. "
"Martin: He said he can't find anything wrong with him physically, he thinks it might be an emotional problem. "
"Daphne: You know, I've heard they have therapists for dogs. Do you suppose a dog psychiatrist could be the answer? "
"Frasier: Only if the question is, 'What is the most asinine thing we could possibly do?' "
"Martin: Maybe Eddie's just lonely, you know, I was thinking maybe we could get another, er... "
"Frasier: Stop right there, Dad We're not getting another dog. "
"Martin: Oh, come on, what could be more fun than having a little brother or sister around the house to play with? "
"Frasier: I fell for that trick once, Dad "
"Martin: Well, I'm going to get this little guy home. "
"Daphne: All right, I'll see you at home. I'll pick up some beans before I go. "
"Roz: Wow. There's a guy over there checking me out. He's coming over here, get out. No, it's too late, just pretend you're not with me. "
"Kagen: Hello, Dr. Crane. "
"Frasier: Dr. Kagen. "
"Kagen: I hope I'm not interrupting you? "
"Frasier: Oh, not at all. I don't even know who she is. "
"Roz: Frasier Hi, I'm Roz Doyle. "
"Kagen: Dr. Stephen Kagen. "
"Frasier: Yes, Dr. Kagen moved into my building about three months ago - from Chicago, I believe? "
"Kagen: Yes, that's right. I love what I've seen in Seattle but I'm still finding my way around. "
"Frasier: Well, Roz is an excellent tour guide. "
"Kagen: Really? Well, if you have an afternoon sometime, maybe you could show me all the hotspots. "
"Frasier: Oh, I think that can be arranged. "
"Roz: I'd be happy to. I'm free tomorrow afternoon. Here's my card. "
"Kagen: Great. I'll give you a call. Nice meeting you, Roz. Dr. Crane. "
"Frasier: Dr. Kagen. "
"Roz: Thank you, Frasier A gorgeous doctor, and I didn't get you anything So, what kind of doctor is he? "
"Frasier: A gynecologist. "
"Roz: That's not funny "
"Frasier: What's the matter? "
"Roz: He really is? Oh God, I can't go out with a gynecologist Do you know what they do all day? "
"Frasier: I have a general idea "
"Daphne: All right, I'll see you at home. "
"Roz: Hey, would you date a gynecologist? "
"Daphne: Oh God, no. "
"Roz: See? "
"Daphne: I wouldn't even date a dentist. Hands in people's mouths all day And after watching Eddie's complete physical, I'm not anxious to date a vet anytime soon "
"TO: ' "
"Frasier: Oh, anyway, that's really more of a side trip. Getting back to our story - by the time I got home that day, alas, for Eddie was no better. "
"TO: "
"Martin: Hey look, Eddie, Mr. Carrot Oh, he'll give you good eyesight, you'll have a lot of fun with this too "
"Frasier: Dad. "
"Martin: Yeah? "
"Frasier: What are you doing? "
"Martin: Oh, I ran out and bought a bunch of new toys for Eddie. I thought it just might cheer him up, you know? Hey Eddie, look at this. Hamburger Juicy, meaty. I bet you'd like a bite of this, wouldn't ya'? No? Well, then there's more for me. [pretending to be "
"hamburger:] I sure hope you don't take a bite out of me at the side. "
"Martin: Did you ever see anything sadder than this? "
"Frasier: No, I can't say that I have. "
"Daphne: Oh, that'll be Dr. Crane. He said he was going to bring his dog over. "
"Martin: Oh, not that four-legged Maris "
"Frasier: Dad, please. Don't call it that in front of him. He has no idea. "
"Martin: How could he not? It acts like Maris, it barks like Maris, aside from the fact that it eats now and then they're dead ringers "
"Daphne: Hello. "
"Niles: Hello Daphne, hello all. I heard Eddie was down, and I thought a playmate might cheer him up, so voila "
"Martin: I appreciate the offer, Niles, but I've already tried it in the park with real dogs and it didn't work. "
"Niles: Well, you'll change your tune when you see my Girl turn on her charm. Okay. "
"Niles: That's it. Oh, oh, I can see her magic working already. Good girl. "
"Niles: Come back, Girl. Come back here this instant Okay. "
"Martin: Oh, Eddie, it's breaking my heart seeing you like this. "
"Daphne: How would a nice old batch of Grammy Moon's sugar biscuits sound? "
"Frasier: Do you honestly believe he can understand a word you're saying? "
"Martin: Hey, I read somewhere that dogs can understand up to four hundred words. Now, a super-smart dog like Eddie probably knows a thousand. "
"Frasier: Oh really, Dad "
"Martin: Eddie understands a helluva lot more than you give him credit for. "
"Daphne: Yes. Why, just yesterday I said, 'Eddie, I've lost my keys' and he looked up at me... "
"vision: "
"Frasier: ...anything other than the simple fact of his name or a grunt "
"Niles: Well, crisis has passed. She just needed a little rest. Fortunately I remembered to bring her sleep mask. "
"Martin: Worse, I'm afraid we're going to have bring in one of those dog psychiatrists. "
"Frasier: Dad, you can't be serious? "
"Martin: Well, I'm desperate, we've tried everything else. "
"Niles: A dog psychiatrist? "
"Frasier: Honestly, Dad, they are the very definition of charlatanism "
"Niles: You simply cannot apply the principals of human psychology to animal behaviour. "
"Frasier: Precisely. Animals operate out of instinct, whereas human beings can reason. "
"Niles: Yes. "
"Frasier: They can cogitate. "
"Niles: Yes. Therefore human beings, through analytical psychotherapy, can... "
"colour: Niles and Frasier take nonsensical gibberish and all Martin "

"Frasier: Thank you for staying with us through the first commercial break. We're talking to Alice, who has a case of the blues today. In order to help her through it I am relating a story from my own life. Any questions so far, Alice? "
"Alice: Well, I was wondering, what happened to Roz and the gynecologist? "
"Roz: Well, since Frasier did tell the most embarrassing part of the story, something kinda funny did happen... "
"TO: Café Nervosa. "
"Roz: Oh my God, you're kidding You were at Camp Lakebridge too. What years were you there? "
"Frasier: Roz "
"TO: Radio Station. "
"Frasier: Roz, we are trying to help this woman. We don't have time for your pointless tangents. Anyway, my father finally got his way and made his appointment for the dog psychiatrist, who insisted that the entire household be present for the first session. "
"TO: "
"Martin: What's keeping this guy? He should have been here be now "
"Frasier: Perhaps he's being detained by his fear of fetching group. "
"Martin: All right now, you two cut it out "
"Shaw: Hello, I'm Dr. Arnold Shaw. "
"Martin: Hi Doc, Marty Crane. Come on in, please. This is Daphne Moon. "
"Daphne: Hello. "
"Martin: And my sons, Frasier and Niles. And this, of course, is the patient. "
"Frasier: I don't suppose whether my father told you, but my brother and I happen to be psychiatrists. "
"Shaw: Oh, how nice, I always enjoy being in the company of colleagues. "
"Niles: I'm sorry, did you say 'colleagues' or 'Collies?' "
"Frasier: It's a joke. "
"Shaw: Very clever, very clever. So, shall we begin? [to "
"Eddie:] Hello Eddie, I'm Dr. Shaw. And I'm here to get to know you and help you get better. You're very sad, aren't you? It's okay to be sad, sometimes I'm sad too. We're going to spend the next hour trying to figure out why you're sad. "
"Frasier: Give a dog an hour, you can bill him for seven "
"Shaw: I'm sorry, I get the feeling that some of us aren't taking this seriously. "
"Frasier: I apologise, it all just seems a bit silly. "
"Shaw: Oh, really? Silly? I'll have you know I just attended the funeral of one Buttons MacFahrlen whose owners felt the same way. "
"Shaw: First, I'd like to administer a dog personality profile quiz- "
"Martin: Oooh "
"Shaw: -I developed. My first questions are based on how you think Eddie might behave if he were a human being. "
"Frasier: Oh, boy "
"Daphne: Shush, this is not a joke This is very serious. "
"Shaw: If human Eddie were planning a dinner party, what might he serve? "
"Martin: I'd say meatloaf. But not the plain kind, but the one with the fancy tomato soup glaze on top. "
"Niles: It might be a bit under done though, he has trouble reaching the knobs on the stove "
"Daphne: Poached salmon. I don't know why "
"Shaw: Interesting. Question "
"two: What do you imagine human Eddie's first words to be? "
"Frasier: Well, I "
"hope: Give me a breath mint I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Right, next one. "
"Shaw: What do you imagine would be human Eddie's favourite cologne? "
"Martin: Rock Revelver, it's a little strong but I think he can pull it off. "
"Daphne: Grey Flannel. I don't know why "
"Frasier: Cologne? Well, actually I think he would prefer toilet water "
"Niles: By the way, same answer for favourite beverage "
"Shaw: I'm sensing a lot of hostility here. "
"Frasier: Well, I'm sorry but I don't see the point. What is any of this telling you about Eddie? "
"Shaw: The point was not to learn about Eddie but was to learn about all of you and might I say... mission accomplished Well, perhaps now would be a good time for me to examine Eddie one on one. Is there a room I can use? "
"Martin: Oh yeah, my room, second on the right. "
"Shaw: Eddie, after you. This may take a while. "
"blue: "
"Daphne: If Eddie were one of the Beatles, I think he'd be George. I don't know why "
"Frasier: And yet she's never been committed. I don't know why "
"Time: 12"
":00) "
"Frasier: Okay, I'll say it. What the hell have they been doing in there for the past hour? "
"Martin: Well, he's probably just talking to him. Eddie happens to be very complex and interesting. "
"Frasier: Oh yes, you must remind me to sit beside him at his next dinner party. "
"Niles: Well, be prepared, he'll be up and down checking on that meatloaf "
"Shaw: Well, I have my diagnosis. "
"Frasier: "
"Finally: the white smoke "
"Shaw: Eddie is indeed depressed. Now if, as you say, there has been no change in his routine, I can only surmise that he's reacting to someone else's unhappiness. Is anyone of you suffering from depression? "
"Frasier: Not me. "
"Daphne: Well, I'm not depressed. "
"Martin: Me, neither. "
"Niles: I'm cheer personified. "
"Shaw: Well, he's picking it up somewhere. To be on the safe side you should all be conscious of how you behave when you're in front of him. Try to speak in pleasant, happy, tones. [to "
"Eddie:] Goodbye, Eddie. Call me in a few days, let me know how he's doing. "
"Martin: Okay, thanks for everything, doc "
"Shaw: Sorry to rush off, but I have a four ó clock appointment at the zoo. There's a hyena there that won't even crack a smile. See, I can joke too "
"Roz: Hold it "
"Frasier: Oh my God, Roz, what's happened? "
"Roz: I want to kill myself "
"Martin: Hey Roz, not in front of Eddie "
"Roz: What? "
"Daphne: That gentleman that just left was a dog psychiatrist. "
"Martin: He said that it would be a good idea if we all had a happy tone around Eddie. "
"Niles: So please tell us, why do you want to kill yourself? "
"Roz: Well, I went out with Dr. Kagen and everything was going so great that I almost forgot what he was. "
"Martin: What is he? "
"Frasier: A gynecologist. "
"Martin: Oh, geez, I don't think I want to hear any more about this. "
"Frasier: All right, Roz, what happened? "
"Roz: Well, we went upstairs to his apartment and he poured a glass of wine, and well... do you know what a speculum is? "
"TO: Radio Station. "
"Frasier: Apparently he was an avid collector of antique gynecological equipment. "
"Frasier: I just got the signal from Roz that we're running out of time. So, I'll skip ahead in our story. "
"TO: "
"Frasier: If you ask me, the man's theory's a whole lot of hooey Who here has any reason to be unhappy? "
"Daphne: Well, mind you I would never say this if it weren't for Eddie's sake, but comparatively "
"speaking: Dr. Crane, you have the most to be depressed about, what with your separation from Mrs. Crane and all. "
"Niles: Wha..? I'm not unhappy. Besides, I don't even live here. "
"Daphne: Please, you're here more than I am. "
"Frasier: You know, I hate to say it, but dad, if anyone's giving off unhappiness, I'm afraid it's you. "
"Martin: Me? "
"Frasier: Yes. "
"Martin: You're the one who hasn't had a date in a year. Not to mention two failed marriages. "
"Frasier: And yet you did. Well, maybe I am not entirely happy. Why should I be? My son lives across the country, there's no woman in my life. Maybe it is I that is making Eddie sad? "
"Daphne: Oh, now, now, don't you take all the blame. If I give my life the once-over I realise it's not all jam. I just lost the only boyfriend I've had in years and the biggest thing in my life is that I got all my hair cut off months ago and no-one's even mentioned it. "
"Daphne: No, no. "
"Niles: Daphne, maybe you were right earlier. I'm not so happy. "
"Martin: Or maybe it's me. My life hasn't been a picnic since Hester died. "
"Roz: Now that I think about it, what have I got to be happy about? I mean, I know it has nothing to do with Eddie, but maybe Frasier picked up something from contact with me? "
"Niles: He wouldn't be the first one... Oh, I'm too depressed "
"Frasier: How loosely woven is the fabric of our unhappiness... a tug or two and it unravels to reveal how empty our everyday lives really are. "
"Niles: And then there are the empty nights... accompanied by thoughts of loneliness and death. "
"Martin: You think about that too? I thought it was just me. "
"Frasier: Everybody thinks about it. "
"Martin: Do you lie real still and hold your breath and pretend you're in the ground? "
"Frasier: No, that's just you. "
"Roz: When I die, I want it to be on my 100th birthday, in my beach house on Maui and I want my husband to be so upset that he has to drop out of college. "
"Daphne: You know, I once had a psychic tell me the strangest thing. That one day I'd go off my rocker, take up a kitchen knife, kill the entire household and then kill myself. Silly old bag She was right about my moving to Seattle, though. "
"Martin: Well, I don't know how I wanna go, but all those years around the police morgue taught me a few things. First off, you don't want to swallow Drano or rat poison. And if you're going to kill yourself with an axe, get it right the first time "
"Frasier: Well, you know, we can talk about it, we can think about it, but nobody really knows how or when. "
"Roz: One second we're alive as anyone else, and then what? "
"Frasier: Darkness, nothingness, afterlife? "
"Niles: I've always liked the notion of meeting the great figures of history. But then I think, what if it's like high school and all the really cool dead people don't want to hang out with me. Mozart'll tell me he's busy but then later I'll see him out with Shakespeare and Lincoln "
"Martin: Well, I don't know about you but this is depressing the hell out of me. Remember, my bell's coming up sooner than you guys "
"Niles: No, no, none of us really knows when our time is up. "
"Roz: And it's never long enough. My great grandmother was 92 years old when she died and the last words to me from her deathbed were, 'it's so short.' Of course, it was the seventies, she could have been talking about my skirt. "
"Frasier: 'I have seen the eternal footman hold my coat and snicker.' "
"Niles: T.S Eliot. "
"Frasier: Dead. "
"Niles: 'Must not all things at the last be swallowed up in death.' "
"Frasier: Plato. "
"Niles: Even deader. "
"Frasier: You know, perhaps Doctor Shaw was right. Perhaps we are the cause of Eddie's depression. "
"Frasier: Simple beast It is here beneath the masks of happiness we all wear. "
"Frasier: The sea that lurks below affected by our sorrows. The once care-free doggy world has been shattered, perhaps forever. "
"Martin: Well, look at him, he's happy again. Could that have been all it was, he was missing his favourite doll? "
"Frasier: I guess Dr. Shaw was wrong after all. He wasn't taking his cue from us, was he? "
"Niles: Well, we were certainly taking a cue from Eddie. I've never been so depressed. "
"Roz: Tell me about it "
"Daphne: Yeah, I wish I was a dog. All it takes is a little toy to make him happy again. "
"Frasier: I'm afraid we're a bit more complex than that, Daphne. We know for whom the bell tolls "
"Martin: Anybody else hear that? "
"Daphne: Oh, the biscuits "
"Frasier: Daphne, by 'biscuits' do you mean cookies? "
"Daphne: Yeah, that's right "
"Martin: Smells good. "
"Niles: Fresh from the oven... "
"Roz: All nice and warm... "
"Daphne: Yes, and I have a fresh pitcher of milk for dipping "
"Frasier: Oh, and I believe there's ice cream too "
"TO: "
"Frasier: So Alice, even the happiest of us can find reasons to be unhappy if only we look for them. So don't look for them. Take a tip from our dog friends - treat yourself to your favourite toy, whatever that might be. "
"Alice: I'll do that right now. Thank you, Dr. Crane, I really do feel better. "
"Frasier: This is Dr. Frasier Crane, reminding everyone that life is too short to dwell on every bump in the road. Try to take pleasure in the simple things. In short, eat a cookie "
"Frasier: Oh, walnut, I broke a tooth Now I've got to go to the dentist, he'll tell me I haven't flossed, my lips are going to get all fat - oh, my life sucks "
"Time: 21"

"Frasier: Well, listeners, flu season is upon us again. As is customary, KACL is offering its employees and their families free flu shots. Now, in order to show the importance of getting a flu shot, I am going to put aside my lifelong fear of needles and be inoculated right here over the air when we come back. "
"Martin: We've been sitting out here half an hour, I've got places to go. "
"Frasier: Well, Dr. Claman is on his way, dad. "
"Roz: Frasier, are you afraid of needles? "
"Frasier: Oh, not really, no. I just say that to encourage people that really are. "
"Roz: Well, they can use the help. You know, those needles they use are about this long and if it hits a nerve when it's going into the muscle... "
"Daphne: Shots are perfectly harmless. You've got nothing to worry about. Well, sure, you hear the occasional story about somebody getting an air bubble in their vein or the needle getting stuck in a bone and the tip breaking off - but that's the exception. "
"Martin: Oh, that's it We're out of here. "
"Daphne: Well, what about my flu shot? I always get a flu shot "
"Martin: Well, you're not getting a flu shot today, you told me you'd drop me off at McGinty's. Now, I told Duke I'd meet him at five 'o clock sharp and he'd pounce if I were not there on time. He sits there with his bottom lip stuck out and eats all of the Brazil nuts out of the bowl because he knows I like them So, come on, let's go. "
"Frasier: Nice to know that men in bars still settle their disputes the old fashioned way, isn't it? "
"Claman: Dr. Crane. "
"Frasier: Oh, Dr. Claman. "
"Claman: Sorry I'm late. My last patient was a bleeder. "
"Frasier: Oh... "
"Roz: Fifteen seconds. "
"Frasier: Where are my manners? Perhaps you should be inoculated first. "
"Roz: I already had my shot. But I could sure use a checkup You're on. "
"Frasier: All right, folks, we're back. Em, joining us for this last minute of our show is Dr. Morris Claman who's going to give me my flu shot. Uh, but, you know, what's the rush? Perhaps we'd be interested in finding out what strains of flu you've isolated this year. "
"Claman: Primarily Singaporian and Guatemalan, would you roll up your sleeve, please. "
"Frasier: And how do you suppose they travelled here? "
"Claman: No idea. Roll up your sleeve. "
"Frasier: Could it have been a careless tourist? A baggage handler? A tainted wok? "
"Roz: Dr. Crane, we're almost out of time. You do want to get that shot, don't you? "
"Frasier: Yes, yes. "
"Claman: Right, first I'm just gonna swab the area with a little alcohol and then I'm going to give you the shot. There, that's done. "
"Frasier: Really? Well, that didn't hurt at all. The newly immunised Dr. Frasier Crane, signing off. "
"Claman: No, no, no, that was just the alcohol. This is the needle. "
"Niles: Well, you're late. All the tables are taken. "
"Roz: No, uh-er, there's one right there. Dibs on that table. "
"Frasier: Roz, Niles was here first. "
"Roz: No, but I'm meeting someone. Please, guys? "
"Niles: Oh, who is it? Another one of your till-dawn-do-us-part relationships? "
"Roz: No, twerp It's a guy who I think really has a chance. I can sense a lot of chemistry between us. "
"Frasier: Dear God When did you two even get out of my sight? "
"Roz: You blanked out for thirty seconds after he gave you the shot "
"Niles: No-one is budging, we're going to be here forever. "
"Frasier: Well, Niles, I suppose we could share a table. There's a couple of seats available there. "
"Niles: Oh, good Lord, we can't sit with strange women. "
"Frasier: Why not? We married strange women "
"Niles: But really, I'm not in the mood. "
"Frasier: You know, just try to relax. It'll do you good to do something spontaneous for a change. "
"Niles: I just... I just... I wouldn't know what to say. And besides, I'm a married man. "
"Frasier: Oh, Niles, please, when will you get rid of that tired old excuse - your off again/off again relationship with Maris? "
"Frasier: Hello, ladies, excuse me, would you mind terribly if we joined you until another table opens us? "
"Laura: Oh, please do "
"Frasier: Oh, thank you so much, that's very kind. I'm Frasier and... and this gentleman dusting for fingerprints is my brother, Niles. "
"Laura: I'm Laura, and this is Beth. "
"Frasier: So... what do you two ladies do? "
"Beth: Er, you don't want to hear about it. "
"Niles: Well, why don't we? "
"Laura: It's just boring - to guys, anyway. "
"Beth: Yeah, their eyes just glaze over when the subject comes up. "
"Frasier: Oh, come on, come on. We're not your average bozos off the street. Why don't you try us? "
"Laura: We design kitchens. "
"Frasier: On the contrary I am always ready to debate the merits of downdraft cook tops and ceramic tile backsplashes. "
"Laura: Whoa Whose little boy are you? "
"Niles: Yes, and just the mention of a double-bowl stainless steel sink with integral drain boards makes me hum like a sub-zero freezer "
"Frasier: You know, I think the key to a good kitchen is comfort. "
"Beth: Well, that's a whole current trend - a living room feel in the kitchen. "
"Niles: Except of course with our father, who favours a kitchen feel in the living room "
"Beth: That's funny You're very witty. "
"Niles: Thank you. "
"Frasier: Oh look, Niles, a table has opened up. "
"Laura: Oh, no, no, don't Stay. "
"Beth: Yeah, this is fun. "
"Frasier: Well, yes, it is fun, isn't it, Niles? "
"Niles: Well, I told you it would be. "
"Frasier: Well, I'll go get us some coffees. "
"Niles: You know I, I... "
"Niles: I'll help. "
"Frasier: I knew you'd panic "
"Niles: Well, I'm sorry, this is still a little new for me. And besides, those two are coming on to us. "
"Frasier: You know, they are very attractive, Niles. "
"Niles: I know "
"Frasier: Maybe we should ask them out? "
"Niles: On a date? We just met "
"Frasier: Good point, Niles Perhaps we should go out with them a few more times before we ask them on a date "
"Niles: I just mean it seems a little rash. "
"Frasier: Well, that's exactly why we should do it. We're being spontaneous today. Come on. "
"Niles: Well, I am enjoying this... er, all right, I'll do it. Oh, oh, wait. We're making an assumption here. "
"Frasier: Hmm? "
"Niles: We could both we interested in the same woman. "
"Frasier: Good Lord, I hadn't thought of that. "
"Niles: All right, I'll declare. I'm interested in Beth. "
"Frasier: Good Good, we really dodged the bullet there. Which one's Beth? "
"Niles: Oh, it's this one here. "
"Frasier: Great "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Here we are. "
"Laura: Oh, Frasier, what a great apartment. "
"Frasier: Well, it's just a little something I threw together. You know, an objet here, an antique there. "
"Beth: And there's the chair. Wow, he wasn't kidding "
"Martin: Oh, hi. "
"Frasier: Dad. "
"Niles: Dad, meet Beth Armstrong and Laura Paris. "
"Martin: Please, have a seat, sit down. So, you've been out on a double date, huh? "
"Beth: Well, sort of. We met this afternoon and the next thing we knew, your sons were taking us out to dinner and then to the Seattle Rep. "
"Martin: Oh, what did you see? "
"Laura: 'The Man Who Came To Dinner.' It's about a bad-tempered invalid that moves into these people's house and just drives them crazy. "
"Martin: Oh, comedy? "
"Frasier: I used to think so "
"Martin: Well, Mr. Smart Alec, as a matter of fact, I was just about to do a favour for you. Sherry and I can't make it to the mountains this weekend and the cabin's already paid for, so I thought maybe you'd like to use it. "
"Frasier: Well, thank you, dad, but Laura and I have plans to go to the symphony. "
"Martin: Oh, how about you, Niles? "
"Niles: Oh, Beth and I are attending an art opening. "
"Martin: Well, if you hear of anybody. Nice meeting you, ladies. I'm really glad the boys brought you over. And it's been a long time since I said that and meant it "
"Niles: Well, dad wasn't really thrilled with the women we married. "
"Frasier: Yes, fortunately my taste has improved a lot since then. "
"Laura: I'm referring to the brandy, of course. "
"Frasier: Hmm, velvety texture, great body... I'm not. "
"Niles: Well, in honour of what happened today - a toast to winging it What greater thrill is there than going down an unknown path, not quite sure where it will lead, just enjoying the way that path winds, and what it looks like, and where it goes off to... er..... "
"Frasier: Perhaps you should have left a trail of breadcrumbs before you started down that toast "
"Laura: You know, Frasier, I'd hate to see you miss a weekend in the country just to take me to the symphony, we can go next week. "
"Frasier: Maybe that... I have a thought. In the spirit of spontaneity that has carried us this far - why don't we postpone our plans are all go to the cabin together this weekend? "
"Laura: I'd love that. "
"Beth: Sounds like fun. "
"Frasier: Well, then, it's settled. Saturday morning we ride the high country "
"Niles: Say, you two have been here five minutes and you haven't seen Frasier's kitchen yet. "
"Frasier: There's really nothing special about it. "
"Niles: Let's let the professionals judge that. "
"Laura: I am kind of curious to take a peek. "
"Niles: Well, peek away. "
"Niles: And some day when you speak of his faux granite countertops - and you will - be kind. "
"Beth: You are SO funny. "
"Frasier: What's going on? "
"Niles: Well, things are going rather fast. Just going out this evening was a big step, but something that involves packing a suitcase, and given my situation, I can't... "
"Frasier: Niles When you are going to stop letting Maris be an anchor on your social life? "
"Niles: Oh, surely that is the most tortured metaphor you've ever come up with Maris, an anchor? "
"Frasier: Even if she's lightweight... For God's sake, oh would you just stop it, you're changing the subject This afternoon, for the first time in your life, a perfectly lovely woman that you don't even know has agreed to go away with you on a weekend. Isn't that exactly the kind of scenario you've always dreamed of? "
"Niles: Yes. "
"Frasier: And if you pass it up, won't you regret it? "
"Niles: Yes. "
"Frasier: Well then, for once in your timid, risk-free life, don't you think it's time you grabbed for that brass ring? "
"Laura: Great kitchen, Frasier You guys feel like firing up the cappuccino maker? "
"Niles: Of course, if I have that much caffeine at this hour, it'll probably make me... YES "
"Frasier: Ah, here we are. "
"Laura: Oh, this place is perfect. "
"Beth: Don't you just love this air? Oh, I am going to sleep like a baby. "
"Laura: Me too. "
"Frasier: I hope you don't mind roughing it. There's no radio or television. "
"Laura: I guess we'll just have to make our own entertainment "
"Beth: We should be able to manage that. Come on, let's go look around outside. "
"Niles: We'll start the fire and we'll be right out. "
"Beth: Okay. "
"Frasier: Well, I think things are going rather well, don't you? "
"Niles: Yes they are, and thank you for twisting my arm. "
"Frasier: You feel like a new man, don't you? "
"Niles: I feel like a new woman, and thank God I remembered to pack one Ah, you know, I just wish I were sure that Beth and I were on the same page. It's been so long, I've forgotten how to read all the signals. "
"Frasier: Well Niles, you don't need a decoder ring to understand the phrase, 'Make our own entertainment' "
"Niles: No-o "
"Frasier: Then again, there was that other statement about sleeping like a baby. "
"Niles: Exactly They could be thinking platonic. The two of them in one room, sleeping like babies. "
"Frasier: The two of us in another, crying like babies. "
"Niles: Well, we're all adults, I suppose we could just ask them what they have in mind. "
"Frasier: That's the worst thing we could do What if they're not interested? They'll be embarrassed and it'll ruin the entire weekend. "
"Niles: Oh, I know Their luggage will tell us We'll put my bag in with your date's, and your bag in with my date's. They'll see the mistake, and the way they correct it will tell us with whom they're planning to spend the night - each other, or us - and either way, it'll all look like a simple misunderstanding. "
"Frasier: You've done this before "
"Niles: Only on my honeymoon, now hurry "
"Frasier: Niles, this is idiotic We're both trained psychiatrists. "
"Niles: Yes, and finally it's paying off "
"Laura: Oh, Frasier, this place is heaven. "
"Beth: Why don't we open up a bottle of wine and watch the sunset? "
"Niles: You know, the sun won't be setting for a little while yet. Just think how much more we'll enjoy it if we got all our unpacking done first "
"Beth: That can wait. "
"Laura: Er, by the way, Beth and I were talking, and I don't know what you guys have in mind for tonight and sorry if this sounds kind of forward, but we would like to avoid an awkward, uncomfortable situation by getting this out in the open right now. "
"Laura: When we go out to dinner tonight, it's on us. "
"Frasier: Well, that's awfully nice of you. Speaking of awkwardness... er, did you know.... "
"Niles: Look at that sunset "
"Frasier: Are you as crazed by this as I am? "
"Niles: It's driving me out of my mind. "
"Frasier: Oh, all right I'm going to settle this once and for all. Now, just follow my lead. "
"Frasier: Yes, now that is lovely, isn't it? "
"Niles: Yes, it is magnificent. ' ' "
"TO: "
"Martin: Not feeling so hot, huh? "
"Martin: What did the doctor say? "
"Daphne: He says I've got... Oh, what was that medical term he used? Oh, I remember - flu "
"Martin: I'm really sorry I didn't let you get that flu shot. Is there anything at all that I can do for you? "
"Daphne: Well, when I was a little girl and got sick, Grammy Moon used to read me to sleep. It's a great comfort. "
"Martin: Oh. Is this what you're reading? "
"Daphne: Yeah. "
"Martin: 'The Rose And The Rapier'? "
"Daphne: Well, if you're not in the mood... [sneezes, coughs violently and then sprays a breath freshener into her mouth] You don't have to. "
"Martin: No, no, I'll do it. "
"Daphne: The bookmark's where I left off. "
"Martin: All right. Okay. 'With a gasp of dismay, she ran to him, her amethyst eyes wide with alarm. 'You fool,' she hissed, 'Suppose someone saw you. The Duke's men are everywhere'.' Hey, this isn't so bad. "
"Daphne: I told you. "
"Martin: ''You fool,' she whispered again, 'You sweet, brave, wonderful fool. I should have died had you not found my bedchamber.'' 'Then she was in his arms and all her qualms forgotten as she... ...tore his tunic asunder and thrust her eager lips against the sinews of his naked chest.' "
"Martin: 'The next morning...' "
"Daphne: You left out a section "
"Martin: Okay, okay 'As his brazen fingers peeled the silken fabric from her heaving... [coughs the word 'bosum' out as he turns red] ...he beheld her quivering alabaster mounds. [takes a huge gulp of his beer to wet his suddenly dry throat] At that moment she felt the proof of his rampant passion... against her milky thighs. His almost God-like beauty was marred only... "
"Martin: ...by the fact that he was...' cross-eyed, three feet tall and had breath like owl droppings "
"TO: "
"Laura: Is there anything more relaxing than just lazing by the fire with a good glass of wine? "
"Beth: Nothing I know of. "
"Niles: You two must be relaxed. Sitting there so calmly when there is still all that unpacking to do. "
"Beth: Oh Niles, we didn't bring that much. "
"Laura: Yeah, we didn't think we'd need too many clothes this weekend "
"Laura: Well, I hate to break things up but I'm getting a little sleepy, so I'm going to get ready for bed. "
"Beth: Yeah, it is getting kinda late. Are you finished with that? "
"Frasier: Niles, this is tearing me apart "
"Niles: These women are inscrutable as sphinxes "
"Frasier: Yes, they've got us into some most veiled, cloaked, cryptic messages. Can't they just give us one clear signal? "
"Beth: Well, I'm off to bed. Niles, are you coming? "
"Niles: Curse these infernal riddles "
"Frasier: Niles "
"Niles: So she really said what I thought she said? "
"Frasier: Yes, go "
"Niles: Suitcase Suitcase "
"Niles: There you are. "
"Frasier: Sleep well. "
"Niles: Oh, you too. "
"Frasier: Niles, what are you doing? "
"Niles: Oh, never mind. Yes, is Mrs. Crane there? Yes, I'll hold. "
"Frasier: What is this, some sort of weird, kinky foreplay? "
"Niles: I'm starting to feel guilty about this. "
"Frasier: Now? "
"Niles: I'm sorry, I just need to clarify the ground rules of Maris's and my separation. "
"Frasier: Oh, fine, fine. I think you might look back on this one day as your darkest hour. But, do what you want to. "
"Niles: Yes, Maris. Er, it occurred to me, we never laid out the rules about our dating other people and what we could and couldn't do. "
"Beth: Niles, what are you doing? "
"Niles: I, er, well, here's the "
"thing: I know that we're allowed to see other people. Em, my question is, how much of them are we allowed to see? "
"Niles: Be with you in a second. I'm sorry, what? Oh, really? Well, that's wonderful, that's all I needed to know. Thank you. "
"Frasier: Yes? "
"Niles: You were wrong. Maris says she doesn't mind at all. "
"Frasier: Ah Well then, off you go "
"Niles: Let the revels begin "
"Frasier: What? "
"Niles: Why doesn't Maris mind at all? "
"Laura: What's going on? "
"Frasier: Er, nothing, just a second, it's Niles. I'll be a moment. Why do you care? "
"Niles: Well, because she could have taken a lover herself and this is her way of alleviating her guilt. "
"Frasier: Okay, Niles, so what do you want to do? Do you want to stew over that all night - let her have all the fun? "
"Niles: Well, no, of course not. "
"Frasier: Well, then - Off you go "
"Beth: Niles "
"Niles: Er, momentito. "
"Niles: Hello? Yes, Maris. Oh, I see, but... all right. "
"Frasier: Yes "
"Laura: Frasier "
"Frasier: I'll just be a second. "
"Niles: She changed her mind, she doesn't want me to go through with this. Do you realise what's happening here? "
"Frasier: Yes Your ex-wife is ruining my sex life Give me that "
"Niles: Could I... What are you doing? "
"Niles: What are you doing? What if she's changed her mind again, how I am supposed to know what to think? "
"Frasier: I'm just going to say this one last time. This weekend is not about thinking, it's about doing. Doing something that the Crane boys haven't done for a very, very long time For once in our miserable, sex-starved lives, can't we do something pleasurable without thinking it to death? "
"Frasier: Don't think about today, don't think about what's right Don't even think of them as Laura and Beth [Laura crosses her arms] For tonight they are just two live, breathing, available female bodies who want us "
"Laura: Think again "
"Niles: Do you remember which snow bank you threw my phone into? "
"Frasier: Oh, I think I could hit it again "
"Niles: Frasier Frasier Frasier "

"Daphne: Oh dear, your chair's got another big rip in the bottom. "
"Martin: Oh Hand me my re-upholstery kit, would you? Thanks. "
"Daphne: Oh, Dr. Crane, don't you look smart. "
"Frasier: Well, I don't feel smart. I let Roz set me up another one of her blind dates. "
"Daphne: Who's the lucky woman? "
"Frasier: Oh, a friend from her aerobics class. Oh, perhaps it won't be so bad. She's thirty-two, has a terrific body, and apparently thinks I'm God's gift to broadcasting. "
"Martin: Well, at least you have one thing in common. "
"Frasier: Dad, when are you going to stop blighting the environment with this atrocity? My God, can't you see that it wants to die? Let it go "
"Martin: You know, I keep having this dream where you say the same words. Only I'm in the hospital and you're slipping the nurse a twenty. "
"Frasier: Dad, that will never happen. "
"Martin: Thank you. "
"Frasier: I have medical power of attorney, it won't cost me a thing. "
"Niles: Hello, Frasier. We were in the neighborhood for a pedicure and a seaweed wrap and we thought we'd stop by. Of course, the pedicure was for... "
"Martin: Stop right there There's no way to finish that sentence that'll make me proud. "
"Niles: I have some wonderful news. I just signed a lease for an apartment in one of the most exclusive buildings in Seattle. "
"Frasier: You don't mean? "
"Niles: I do. As of next week, I'll be a resident of... [holds out his lease] the Montana. "
"Frasier: Niles, why would you want to live in such a stodgy building? When I applied there they treated me as if I was riff-raff. "
"Niles: Well, if you're going to answer your own questions, what do you need me for? The best part is, I'll never have to give my address again. From now on, I'll simply be, 'Dr. Niles Crane, The Montana.' "
"Daphne: That's a lovely building. I've only been there once, applying for a job. "
"Niles: I can't imagine anyone turning down a chance to hire you. "
"Daphne: I hope you're right, I haven't heard yet. Well, goodnight "
"Martin: Hey, Frasier, you don't... "
"Frasier: Oh, just relax, dad. It's just her way of angling for more vacation time. "
"Martin: What if she isn't? "
"Frasier: Well, they'd still have to call me for a reference. Either way, she's not going anywhere. "
"Niles: Gosh, that's uncanny, dad. "
"Martin: What is? "
"Niles: The way she's taken with you. She's absolutely mesmerized. "
"Martin: She is not. "
"Niles: Oh, she is. She's just playing hard to get. [pushes Girl toward Martin] Go to Grampa. Isn't she warm and cuddly? Oh, I see I'm going to have a tough time tearing you two apart "
"Frasier: You know, I'm going to go out on a limb here. The Montana doesn't accept pets, does it? "
"Niles: On the contrary, they welcome them. Just not cats or dogs. "
"Martin: Well, then you're in luck, because I don't know what the hell this thing is "
"Frasier: There is no way that dog is moving in here with us "
"Niles: Oh please, at least if she's here I'll be able to come and visit her. I cannot turn her over to strangers. [whispering confidentially] She worships me. "
"Frasier: Oh pul-eeze, you must realise that dog has no genuine affection for you. You only pretend that she does because she's a canine substitute for Maris "
"Niles: That is the most absurd psychobabble I have ever heard. "
"Frasier: She is highly strung, cold to the touch and ignores you. My God, stand her upright, take ten pounds off her, put her in a Chanel suit, whatcha got? "
"Niles: I'm sorry, that's ridiculous. "
"Frasier: Oh, is it really? Do you remember that little pilbox hat that Maris wore to the the Duchamps' wedding? "
"Niles: Absolutely. "
"Roz: Hi, Frasier. So how did it go with Rita last night? "
"Frasier: She didn't quite take to me. "
"Roz: Oh, you're just being hard on yourself like you always are. "
"Frasier: You tell me. Over appetizers, she suddenly remembered that she had a very early morning meeting, so she suggested we skip the jazz club after dinner. "
"Roz: People have meetings. "
"Frasier: Mmm-hmm. When the waiter suggested a soufflé for desert that would take an extra thirty minutes she said, 'Oh Dear God, no' "
"Roz: She was probably on a diet. "
"Frasier: After I dropped her off at home, I noticed she had left her suede jacked in my car. I called to offer to swing it by and she said, and I quote, 'Just keep it.' "
"Roz: What did you do to her? "
"Frasier: Nothing God Roz, I have had it. In the past six months I have done everything a man can possibly do to meet a woman. Singles bars, blind dates, lecture series at the museum. I've even spent hours in the grocery store trying to look helpless in the produce department That's it. I'm taking myself off the market. Frasier Crane has thumped his last melon. "
"Roz: You know, Frasier... "
"Frasier: Roz, Roz, please. I know what you're going to say. I should climb back on that horse, I'm too great a catch to give up now. "
"Roz: No, I think you should give up. "
"Frasier: What? I don't really want to give up. I don't really want to give up, I was just saying that to get your sympathy. "
"Roz: It happens sometimes. When you get into a really bad streak, you start to get desperate. Women can smell it. "
"Frasier: Smell it? "
"Roz: Mmm-hmm. As soon as the man begins to get overeager - you know, like complimenting you too much, or laughing too hard at all your jokes - you just want to turn and run "
"Frasier: I don't do that "
"Roz: Oh honey, wake up and smell... well yourself You just have to air it out a little bit. And in my experience, the minute you stop looking, the perfect person falls right in your lap. "
"Frasier: Well Roz, as much as I appreciate you comparing me to a dead squirrel in a heating duct, I think you're wrong. "
"Christine: Hey, Roz. "
"Roz: Hey. "
"Christine: I got those pictures you were looking for. Hey, Dr. Crane. "
"Frasier: Hey, you look really lovely today, Christine. It is Christine, isn't it? "
"Christine: That's what it says on my driver's license. "
"Frasier: Oh God, I reek, don't I? "
"TO: "
"Niles: ...inlay of Philippine mahogany. And we conclude our little tour back here in the living room. "
"Daphne: It's very posh. "
"Martin: Niles, why a bed in the living room? "
"Niles: That's not a bed, dad. It's an antique fainting couch. "
"Daphne: My goodness, they had furniture for everything back then, didn't they "
"Niles: Ah, I'm glad you made it. "
"Frasier: You know, Niles, this precious little building of yours isn't as exclusive as you think. Your doorman waved me right through. "
"Niles: Oh, that's because he knows you. "
"Frasier: Oh, fan of my show? "
"Niles: No, he lives in your building. "
"Martin: So Niles, what did you do about the dog? "
"Niles: Oh, I found a wonderful family to adopt her. "
"Daphne: Well, I'm sure it won't take you long to adjust to being alone again. "
"Niles: Well, actually I won't have to. Follow me, there's someone I'd like you to meet. It was love at first sight She's very exotic, only eats every other day, and she's so white she's almost blue "
"Martin: Wow, I'm getting nervous. That's what he said just before he introduced us to Maris "
"Niles: Everybody, meet Baby. "
"Baby: I love you. "
"Frasier: You bought a bird? "
"Niles: Well, I started to think how quiet it would be around here, and she is lovely and she is so affectionate. "
"Baby: I love you. "
"Niles: Ah She says that all the time. I love you too, baby. "
"Baby: I love you, grandma. "
"Niles: She's still in transition from her last owner. "
"Niles: Ow, ow Let go of my shoulder You don't like that noise, do you, baby? Go to your food. Oh, good girl. Excuse me. "
"Daphne: Oh you know, I've always been fascinated by these birds that can actually learn how to talk. "
"Martin: Aw, they can't talk. They just a drill a few words into them at the pet shop and they never learn anything else after that. "
"Frasier: It is attractive, though. "
"Martin: Yeah well, that's the way they "
"are: Cute but stupid. "
"Baby: Cute but stupid "
"Frasier: You know Daphne, I think we should leave these two alone. I sense a real battle of wits shaping up. "
"Niles: Well, I'm off to an auspicious start in the building. One of my neighbours got my mail by mistake. Look at those bills, what must she think of me? "
"Frasier: But Niles, everyone gets bills. "
"Niles: Not at the Montana. They all have people. Their bills go to their people. I want them to think I have people too. I used to have people... only they were Maris's people. "
"Frasier: Niles, if you keep this up you won't even have the people who don't care you don't have people. "
"Niles: Well, it just shows how essential it is to make a good impression when moving into a new building, which is why I'm throwing a dinner party Friday night for a few select residents. I'll show them such a good time there'll be no question that I belong here. "
"Frasier: Am I invited? "
"Niles: Yes you are, but I'm afraid you can't bring a date. You know how I hate a crowded table. "
"Frasier: It's alright. I've taken myself off the dating circuit. I'm afraid I was getting a bit desperate. "
"Niles: Well, I was a bit concerned when you called to ask if Gloria was our first or second cousin. "
"Martin: Niles, you gotta see this, your bird's eating peanut butter It's even funnier than when Eddie does it "
"Niles: Dad "
"Niles: Frasier, would you get that? And pretend you're my people. "
"Stephanie: Oh, I'm sorry, I was looking for Dr. Crane. I found some more of his mail. "
"Frasier: Well, I'm a Dr. Crane. I'm Niles's brother. "
"Stephanie: Oh my gosh, you're Frasier Crane from the radio, aren't you? Oh, I love your show. "
"Frasier: Thank you. "
"Stephanie: Oh, Stephanie Garret. "
"Frasier: Stephanie. "
"Stephanie: You know, em, you are not going to believe this but when I was a freshman at Harvard, I saw you perform the pirate king in a production of 'Pirates Of Penzance.' "
"Frasier: Oh my God. "
"Stephanie: No, no, you were great. You were so good, I brought my husband back to see you the next night. Well, he wasn't my husband then. Well, actually he's not my husband now. "
"Frasier: Glad to hear that. No, glad to hear you came for a second time, not that you have an ex-husband. You know, I have one too. Not a husband, ex-wife. I mean a woman... is it getting hot in here? "
"Stephanie: Yeah, a bit Well, it was nice to meet you. "
"Frasier: Wait, you know, Niles is having a little party on Friday for some of his enchanting new neighbors. [Niles appears listening in] Is there any chance you could join us? "
"Stephanie: Yes, I think I could, if Niles has room. "
"Niles: The more the merrier "
"Stephanie: I'll look forward to it. "
"Frasier: As will I. "
"Frasier: Roz was right As soon as I stop looking for the perfect woman, she falls right in my lap "
"Niles: Well, I hope you'll be comfortable with that arrangement, because that's where she'll be seated Friday night "
"Time: 10"
":20) "
"Niles: Bon Appetite, Bon Appetite. Now, you try it, Baby. Bon Appetite. "
"Baby: Bon Appetite. "
"Niles: What a quick little study you are. Bird-brained indeed You already know more French than my father. "
"Niles: Ow Boy, if you don't get used to that doorbell we're going to have to give you a serious manicure. [sounds again and she digs in] Ow I'm coming, I'm coming, stop ringing "
"Frasier: Oh, good evening, Niles. Or should I say, 'avast ye, matey' "
"Niles: I don't have time for your badinage, I'm only just putting out my place cards. "
"Frasier: Place cards, how elegant. Who is Peter Soutendeck? "
"Niles: He's on your right. He's an investment banker from Amsterdam, and apparently he handles a lot of Bill Gates's money. So don't say anything derogatory about the Netherlands or Microsoft. "
"Frasier: Oh, damn. There goes my opening joke about the Dutchman trying to install Windows '95. Stephanie's over here, I'm not sitting next to her. "
"Niles: I know, you see, Peter's bringing a date so I thought it would be better... What are youdoing? "
"Frasier: Putting Stephanie next to me "
"Niles: And throwing off my whole seating arrangement? "
"Frasier: Niles, surely you realise I've spent a long time looking for a woman like Stephanie. "
"Niles: Yeah. "
"Frasier: Now, listen. I'm afraid if you want to impress these people you've got to get a little more atmosphere here in the room. You know, I'll light the fire while you dim the lights a bit. "
"Niles: Oh, that's a good idea. By the way, be careful with that fireplace, it can be a bit... "
"Niles: Holding on a bit tight there, Baby, aren't you? Go to your perch. Go to your perch. Frasier, this bird's holding onto my scalp. [tries to move her but she won't budge] I can't pull it off. "
"Frasier: Niles, after that jaunty beret you wore to brunch last Sunday, you can pull anything off. "
"Niles: Get the lighter. Put fire near my head. Fire will frighten her off. Try that. "
"Frasier: Oh here, the phone. "
"Frasier: Niles, call for help "
"Niles: And who do you suggest we call, a Fez rental? Go on, Baby, go to your perch. Go to your food, go to your bed "
"Frasier: Niles, don't panic Try to stay calm. "
"Niles: How can I stay calm? I have six dinner guests arriving in exactly... "
"Niles: Ah, ow "
"Frasier: You go call the vet and I'll go and take care of things out here. "
"Frasier: Oh, hello. "
"Stephanie: Hello. "
"Frasier: Please come in. "
"Stephanie: I'm not early, am I? "
"Frasier: No, not at all. May I get you a drink? "
"Stephanie: Ah, yes. White wine, please. [they head to the wine desk where Frasier pours] What a lovely table [points to dining area] "
"Frasier: Yes, I notice we happen to be sitting next to one another. "
"Stephanie: Good, now I won't have to change the place cards around. "
"Frasier: Well, to the girl next door. "
"Stephanie: Well, actually it's a little further down the hall. "
"Frasier: Well, if you need a ride home tonight don't hesitate to ask. "
"Stephanie: What was that? "
"Frasier: Oh, I'm afraid Niles probably burned himself on something. Don't worry, he'll be fine. "
"Frasier: Hello, please do come in. I'm Frasier Crane, Niles's brother. "
"Carol: I'm Carol Larkin, my husband Alfred, this is our niece, Wella. "
"Frasier: Nice to meet you. Please make yourself comfortable, I'm just going to run into the kitchen and check on the bird. "
"Niles: Uh-huh, uh-huh, so you've seen this thing before. I see. Alright, well, thank you. "
"Frasier: What did he say? "
"Niles: Well, he thinks she was traumatized by the fire and she had a shock. He said we shouldn't try to force her off, we need to relax her. "
"Frasier: Fine, you take care of that, I've got the future Mrs. Crane out there in the other room. "
"Niles: Well, wait, wait, wait, wait, how am I supposed to relax this bird? "
"Frasier: I don't know. Oh, try delivering that keynote you gave at the psychiatric association last spring. "
"Frasier: Everything alright out here? "
"Alfred: Will Dr. Crane be joining us soon? "
"Frasier: Oh yes, I believe so, any minute now. "
"Carol: Oh dear, something wrong? "
"Frasier: I keep telling him, get yourself a decent oven mitt, but you know... "
"Frasier: Hello, please come in. I'm Frasier, Niles's brother. "
"Peter: Peter Soutendeck, nice to meet you. This is Elanie Hensley. "
"Elaine: Actually your brother and I are well acquainted. Maris is a dear, dear friend of mine. "
"Frasier: Really? "
"Elaine: Yes, so where is he? "
"Frasier: He's in the kitchen, savoring for you tonight a lovely pheasant. "
"Frasier: As you know, he's a stickler for freshness "
"Frasier: Oh, what now? "
"Niles: I'm trying to pretend like it's night so it'll fall asleep. "
"Frasier: Well, you look very cute. "
"Baby: Cute but stupid "
"Frasier: Listen Niles, I really can't stall them any longer, they're starting to ask questions. The Dutchman's date even knows Maris. "
"Niles: What? What's her name? "
"Frasier: Elaine somebody. "
"Niles: Which Elaine? Maris knows three Elaines. "
"Frasier: I don't know, she's very thin, she's exquisitely dressed, and dripping with attitude. "
"Niles: Oh, like that narrows it down "
"Niles: Damn I was afraid of that, it's the bad Elaine, Maris's oldest friend. Nothing would delight her more than to report back to Maris that I threw a soiree with a cockatoo on my head "
"Baby: Bon Appetite "
"Elaine: What was that? "
"Frasier: Bon Appetite Crab puff, anyone? Bon Appetite "
"Frasier: At which point, the woman said to Churchill, 'Sir, if you were my husband I would put poison in your coffee.' To which Churchill sorely replied, 'Madame, if you were my wife I'd drink it' Perhaps you've heard that story. "
"Alfred: Yes, from Churchill. "
"Frasier: Well, can I freshen anyone's drink? "
"Frasier: Perhaps I'll just bring the bottle around. "
"Stephanie: I didn't realise that you were going to play host all night. I mean, we've hardly had a chance to talk, and I'm afraid I'm going to have to make it an early night. Yes, I'm leaving to Paris first thing in the morning and I was really hoping that we could spend some time alone. "
"Frasier: And so we shall. As of this moment, it's just the two of us, you'll get my complete attention.. [sees Elaine walking to kitchen and he runs to block her] ...just after this. Oh Elaine, would you like a fill up? "
"Elaine: Well actually I was seeing what Niles is up to in there, perhaps I can be of some help. "
"Frasier: Well, you know you could pour the wine... "
"Frasier: You are totally ruining my chances with Stephanie "
"Niles: Yes, that was my first concern too. Toss. You can't abandon me just because you're hoping she is just as horny as you are. "
"Frasier: The first thing you've got to do is go to the vet and have that thing removed "
"Niles: Oh, are you mad? I can't walk through there with this thing on my head, I'd be the laughingstock of the Montana. "
"Frasier: You can't spend the night in the kitchen "
"Niles: Frasier, these people live for gossip. I've only been here three days and I already know that Peter's a letch and Carol's a lush. What do think they'd say about me? "
"Frasier: You know, I've spent the last forty-five minutes with these people. I think they are kind and understanding, I think they'll be very sympathetic with your problem. "
"Niles: Really? "
"Frasier: Yes. "
"Niles: You don't think they'll laugh at me? "
"Frasier: No, I don't. And furthermore, if you stay in here they'll think you're rude, bad-mannered, and - dare I say it - a bad host. "
"Niles: Fine, I'll go out there. But if they ridicule me, let it be on your head Open the door. "
"Frasier: Everyone? Excuse me, Niles has had a little mishap, he will have to go to the doctor. It's nothing serious, he just has to have something removed. Niles "
"Frasier: You see, his bird suffered a kind of trauma and has attached itself to the scalp and we just... "
"Niles: Frasier, Frasier, this isn't necessary. Good evening, everyone, I'm terribly sorry for all this. "
"Elaine: Oh Niles, you mean all this time you've been hiding in there because of your bird? Oh, you poor thing. "
"Peter: You know, the same thing happened to my mother once, only with her cat. Now that was a sight "
"Carol: Who hasn't had an embarrassing moment at a party? [drunk, she spills wine all over her and laughs] Look, I just spilled wine on my dress "
"Niles: This is such a relief. I must say, I feel a bit silly for staying in there for so long. "
"Alfred: Are you in any pain? "
"Niles: No, no. As long as no-one rings the doorbell I'm fine. "
"Frasier: Well, you know, you seem to relaxing a bit, maybe the bird will relax. Shall we give this another minute or two, everyone? "
"Niles: Alright then, who needs more wine? [he begins to pour still with the bird on his head] Alfred, white for you. And would anyone like some cheese or a cracker? "
"Baby: Squawk. "
"Niles: No, no, Baby, guests first Oh Carol, that dress is absolutely smashing "
"Carol: Why, thank you. "
"Baby: Carol's a lush. "
"Carol: Did the bird just say something? "
"Wella: It sounded like it said... "
"Baby: Carol's a lush. "
"Alfred: Where would a bird learn a phrase like that? "
"Niles: Birds today You don't know where they pick these things up Well, shall we all join Peter at the table? "
"Baby: Peter's a letch. "
"Peter: What did that say? "
"Niles: I said, 'let's all sit down.' "
"Baby: Peter's a letch. "
"Peter: Is this your idea of a joke? "
"Alfred: I've had quite enough of this. "
"Niles: Hang on Carol, don't go, I did not teach the bird these phrases, I don't know where she picked them up. "
"Frasier: Please, you'll stay won't you, Stephanie? "
"Baby: Stephanie's horny "
"Stephanie: Oh my God, is that what you've been saying about me behind my back? "
"Frasier: No, no, I never said that about you, I said that about me I'm the horny one, all I said was you were very cute. "
"Baby: Cute but stupid "
"Stephanie: Well, thank you both for a wonderful evening Good evening "
"Frasier: Stephanie, please let me explain. "
"Niles: I know we got off on the wrong foot, but we are going to be neighbours, so... "
"Frasier: Well... thank you very much "
"Niles: Oh please, I lost far more than you did "
"Frasier: Really? That was one of the most promising romantic prospects I've had in years What have you lost? The respect of a parched lush and a Dutch letch Thanks for learning that, Baby "
"Niles: Alright, I apologize. "
"Frasier: Thank you. I suppose I could drive you to the vet now. Maybe we should take the service elevator? "
"Niles: Oh, what's the point? I don't think my reputation can suffer anymore than it already has. "
"Frasier: I wouldn't be so sure about that. Wearing a white bird after Labor day "

"Frasier: Oh, congratulations. "
"Niles: Thank you. There's a downside though - they're New Age types - the wedding's to be held in the woods. "
"Frasier: So? "
"Niles: I need a date. You know how the women in my crowd tend to droop outdoors. "
"Frasier: Yes, well Niles, there are all sorts of different women in the world. Perhaps if you tiptoed beyond the fringes of your precious circle, cast a wider net... "
"Niles: Frasier? That woman by the side of the road, spearing trash "
"Frasier: Not that wide. "
"Niles: No, no. It's Roz "
"Frasier: My God, it is "
"Niles: If she realizes we've recognised her, she'll be utterly humiliated. OH, ROZ? "
"Roz: Oh my God You're not seeing me Go away "
"Frasier: Roz What on earth are you doing here? "
"Roz: Just let me in. "
"Niles: Wait, I'll spread papers. "
"Frasier: Oh, yes. Thank you, Niles. All right. "
"Roz: Okay, let's go. "
"Frasier: What? What do you mean, 'Let's go'? I can't do that, I don't even know why you're here. "
"Roz: About a month ago, I got stopped doing sixty in a thirty-mile- an-hour zone. It was either a huge fine or community service. So here I am. It's a nightmare. Breathing exhaust fumes, using a spatula to scrape up roadkills... "
"Frasier: Well, at least look on the bright side. You're outdoors, you can enjoy nature, you're beautifying our highways... "
"Roz: Frasier, I found an ear "
"Frasier: Are there no other services you could have performed? "
"Roz: The only other option was visiting old people in a retirement home. "
"Frasier: And you chose this? "
"Niles: Well, think about it. Walking the streets, picking up trash; You can see how Roz would go with the familiar. [this earns him a clip round the head from Roz] "
"Roz: Old people just make me uncomfortable. "
"Frasier: Roz, have you considered that your discomfort around the elderly may stem from your own fear of growing old? "
"Roz: Oh my god "
"Frasier: What? "
"Roz: It's my supervisor. Hit the gas. "
"Frasier: I can't. It might be illegal. "
"Roz: Move, or your brother gets it "
"Frasier: Absolutely not "
"Roz: All right, the head rest. "
"Frasier: Off we go. "
"Frasier: Oh, well Dad. Doing your exercises. Very good. "
"Daphne: There you go Congratulations, Mr Crane You finally got your knee past your ribcage. "
"Martin: Oh, it's no big deal. "
"Frasier: Well, it's more than Lilith could accomplish after five years of marriage. "
"Daphne: You know, it's so gratifying seeing your father make these little improvements. It's days like this I'm glad that I took this position. "
"Niles: We're all glad you took this position. "
"Frasier: Well, you know Daphne, I must say there are some times I envy you. Here you go, Niles. "
"Frasier: You know, I'm just saying it's always gratifying to see some reward for your efforts. Lately, that's something I've been lacking in my own work. "
"Niles: How so? "
"Frasier: Oh, well you know, back in private practice I could spend months, even years with a patient, see the fruits of my labor. Now, somebody calls in, I give my advice, and never know how things work out. I simply release my humble words into the airwaves and then they're gone forever, vanished. "
"Niles: So like my Tiffany cufflinks. I'd hoped to wear them to my new age wedding, they've disappeared. "
"Frasier: So you know my pain Well, I'm not really dissatisfied, it's just that... well, Daphne, you know, you get to see your progress with Dad; Niles, you have the upcoming marriage of your commitment phobics... "
"Martin: Oh, c'mon, you help people all the time. You helped me just the other day. "
"Frasier: How? "
"Martin: Well, I was worried because Eddie had lost his appetite, and remember what you said? "
"Frasier: If I remember rightly, I said, 'Well, why don't you give him some of my truffle foie gras?' "
"Martin: Right. "
"Frasier: I was being funny. "
"Martin: ...Oh. Well, yeah. Well, I knew that. Ha-ha. That just cheered me right up. C'mon, Eddie "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Excuse me, Bulldog? "
"Bulldog: What's up, Doc? "
"Frasier: Listen, have you seen Roz? She's late. My show goes on in thirty seconds. "
"Bulldog: You know what? I'd dump her. "
"Frasier: That's a little extreme, don't you think? "
"Bulldog: No. I fire everybody once a year. Housekeepers, personal trainers, phutt. You know, cut them off before they start copping an attitude. Oh, oh - doctors are the worst of all. You pick up the same disease three or four times, they start lecturing you like it's your fault. Want a bite? "
"Frasier: Not if you skipped it to me over a pool of disinfectant. "
"Frasier: Hello, Seattle. Good afternoon, this is Dr Frasier Crane. You know, today we're going to do things just a little bit different. For the past four years now I've been taking your calls and giving advice, and I was thinking, perhaps our listeners are wondering how things have turned out. I know I do. So today I invite those of you who've called in in the past to give us a holler, and we can catch up on how things have worked out for you. All our lines are open... "
"Frasier: Come on. Come on, you know the number. Ah, there we are. Hello, this is Dr Frasier Crane. How did I help you? "
"Chet: Hello, Dr Crane, this is Chet from Whitby Island. I gave you a call last year? I was having problems with low self-esteem. "
"Frasier: Ah, ah, I see. And did my advice help you to become more assertive? "
"Chet: Damn straight. And now people say I'm downright arrogant. Well, you know what I say? Screw 'em "
"Frasier: Well, perhaps you took my advice just a bit too far. "
"Chet: Who the hell are you? Screw you too "
"Frasier: Well, as I give myself a well-deserved pat on the back, and Chet marches off to invade Poland, let's just go to commercial. Well Roz, glad you could join us. "
"Roz: You're lucky I made it at all. I took your advice, went down to that retirement home to finish off my community service.. "
"Frasier: Ooh, lot better than spearing trash, isn't it? "
"Roz: You tell me. I started playing checkers with this old man, Mr. Krantz? Well, things got a little competitive and he made a really bad move and I said, 'You're a dead man' "
"Frasier: Oh, dear. I think I see where this story is headed. "
"Roz: A minute later, he's lying sprawled across the board, pieces are everywhere, the whole place is screaming... when I pulled him up he still had a checker stuck to his forehead. "
"Frasier: Roz, I am so sorry. I, I can see how you could be very traumatized by this... Hi, we're back. That was a very catchy commercial, wasn't it? Let's get back to it. Roz, listen. You can't be too upset about this. Now given the circumstances, his age and his surroundings, surely this thing was sort of expected. "
"Roz: Not with this guy. The whole reason I liked him was he was so youthful and robust. You should have seen him, Frasier. He was raring to go, he kept bragging about how good he was and how much fun it was going to be, and he dies on me "
"Bulldog: Hey, it happens to all guys, okay? "
"Frasier: Bulldog... "
"Bulldog: No, no. This is a pet peeve of mine, doc. Why is it always the guy's fault? You know, if you chicks needed a little less booze to get from 'maybe' to 'yes,' we'd be a lot more alert when the moment of truth arrives. "
"Frasier: Bulldog, Roz was playing checkers with an elderly gentleman and he died. "
"Bulldog: Oh, well.... when I said 'We' I didn't mean me, because I don't have that... "
"Bulldog: Hey, you're a doctor, that was confidential "
"Roz: Well, guess it's back to scraping up roadkills. "
"Frasier: Roz, Roz, surely you realise what happened today at the retirement home was an aberration. "
"Roz: Well, maybe so, but I wasn't comfortable being around old people to begin with and this certainly hasn't helped matters. "
"Frasier: Now Roz, listen. If you're ever going to conquer your fear of aging you've got to get back down there and spend some time with these people. You'll learn that they're really vital human beings. "
"Roz: Well, I'm still not convinced. "
"Frasier: All right then, think of it this "
"way: there's been a lot of fog on the interstate lately and the caribou are migrating. "
"TO: "
"Roz: 'As the train whistle screamed, and we started out of the station, I lowered the window and "
"said: 'I'll be back.' But somehow I knew I would never see her or Paris again. The end.' That was a pretty good book, wasn't it, Mr. Gouldenstein? Mr Gouldenstein, you're feeling a little cold. Can I make you a nice hot cup of... OH MY GOD "
"Martin: Come on boy, you can do it. "
"Martin: Hey-hey, Fras. Look at that, he's dancin'. He's practically doing a polka. "
"Frasier: Oh, good. That should up his price when I sell him to the carnival. "
"Daphne: Hello. "
"Niles: Hello, Daphne. "
"Martin: Back from the big wedding in the woods, huh? "
"Daphne: Yes, and don't you look nice. Except, what's this sticky stuff all over your shoulder here? "
"Frasier: Did you finally find a date? "
"Niles: I asked Maris. "
"Daphne: Sap. "
"Frasier: I think Daphne speaks for us all. Just how the hell did this happen? "
"Niles: Well, I was desperate for a date, and I, I knew Maris would be lonely this time of year. It's cruise season, she never partakes. She has an absolute terror of buffets. "
"Frasier: Oh, yes. Legendary smorgaphobia. "
"Martin: So how did it go? Or should I say, how big a scene did she make? "
"Niles: Actually she did quite well. She willingly joined in the ceremonial chanting. When the shaman invited those so inclined to embrace their favorite tree, Maris said the only tree she was willing to embrace was her family tree. Everyone laughed. Well, I laughed. Then it happened. They called for a group hug. "
"Frasier: Oh, dear. "
"Niles: Last time I saw her, she was racing towards her Mercedes, emitting a high-pitched shriek that caused the wedding doves to attack one another. Let me see if I can't find something to remove this sap. "
"Roz: Another one died. "
"Frasier: What? What happened? "
"Martin: What's she talkin' about? "
"Frasier: Oh. Dad, Roz has been doing some community service down at a retirement home. Apparently, for the second time this week one of her charges has died. "
"Martin: Oh. "
"Roz: They're calling me 'The Angel Of Death' now. "
"Frasier: Well as you know, this isn't your fault. "
"Roz: Maybe it is. I've never been good with plants or animals. Everything's always died on me. "
"Frasier: You have a cat. Oh. I'm so sorry. "
"Daphne: Roz, death is an occupational hazard of working with older people. Trust me. I've lost more patients than I'd like to count. "
"Martin: You've never said anything about that to me. "
"Daphne: Didn't I? Anyway, you just sit there, and I'll go make you a nice cup of tea. [heads towards kitchen, followed by Martin] "
"Martin: Hey, wait. How many patients did you lose? "
"Daphne: Well, I don't know. I used to keep a tally in my diary, but it made me a bit sad. "
"Martin: Was it more than five? "
"Frasier: Now listen, Roz. There's no way that you can feel guilty about this. I mean, those men were going to die anyway. If anything, you gave them some much-welcomed companionship in their final moments. "
"Roz: It just seems so unfair. One minute he's lying in the bed, smiling and happy - ten seconds later, it's over. "
"Niles: For heaven's sake, it happens to every man a couple of times in his life. Why can't you women take it as a compliment? End Of Act One. Act Two. "
"Roz: Look, I appreciate you coming down here with me, but I don't think I can make it. "
"Frasier: Roz, we have discussed this. This is going to be your breakthrough day. "
"Roz: They hate me here "
"Frasier: You're just overreacting. There is no way they think you're the Angel of Death. "
"Roz: I'm leaving. "
"Frasier: No. Roz, this is not like you. The Roz I know is not a quitter, she's a fighter. "
"Roz: I just can't help thinking it's going to happen again. They always die in threes. "
"Frasier: Oh come on, that's just celebrities. C'mon. "
"TO: Moira's Room. "
"Roz: Hi. I'm Roz. "
"Moira: I'm Moira. Come in. "
"Roz: How you feeling today? "
"Moira: Fine. "
"Roz: Really? Do you feel okay? "
"Moira: Yes. Now do me a favour and hand me those cigarettes. "
"Roz: You know, these things do come with a warning. "
"Moira: So do you, darling. I let you in. "
"TO: corridor. "
"Frasier: Good afternoon. How do you do? "
"Norman: Is that Dr. Crane? "
"Frasier: Yes. "
"Norman: Dr. Frasier Crane? "
"Frasier: Yes. Have we met? "
"TO: Norman's Room as Frasier enters. "
"Norman: No, but I thought that was you. I recognized your voice from the radio. I listen to your program all the time. Norman Webster. "
"Frasier: Well ah, it's my pleasure. "
"Norman: Are you here visiting somebody? "
"Frasier: Oh no. I'm just here with a friend of mine, Roz. She's here doing some community service. "
"Norman: Ah, the Angel of Death, nice girl. Y'know, I remember one day I was listening to your program, and ah, it was right after my wife died and I was going through kind of a rough patch. You told this guy who was going through the same thing that he should keep pictures of his wife around to help with the transition. That was a good idea. "
"Frasier: So you started keeping pictures of her? "
"Norman: That wouldn't make much sense now, would it? "
"Frasier: Well, no. Well, what did you do? "
"Norman: Well, I remembered when we were dating, Helen made this life mask of herself for art class, and I had my daughter dig through the attic, and lo and behold, [picks up porcelain mask] she found it. This is the way she looked when we met. Isn't she beautiful? "
"Frasier: Oh yes. "
"Norman: So you were right. Every night, before I fall asleep, I run my fingers over Helen's beautiful face, and it takes me back to all those wonderful years we had together. It made a world of difference. I want to thank you. You really helped me. "
"Frasier: You've no idea how nice it is to hear that. "
"Norman: Would you excuse me? It's time for me to take one of my many pills. Make yourself at home. "
"Frasier: Thank you. "
"Norman: What was that? "
"Frasier: Nothing Nothing, ahh, I just knocked your ashtray over. "
"Norman: I hope it wasn't damaged. My grandson made that for me at summer camp. "
"Frasier: Oh no, it's intact. Not the tiniest chip. "
"Norman: Set it back on the table. You know how attached you get to family things. Do you have children, Dr Crane? "
"Frasier: Yes. "
"Norman: Dr Crane, are you on the floor? "
"Frasier: I was just ah, tying my shoelace. Yes, yes I have a son. I'd much rather hear about your family. "
"Norman: Well, I have four sons and one daughter. You wouldn't happen to be single now by any chance, Dr Crane? "
"Frasier: As a matter of fact, I am. "
"Norman: So's my daughter. I'll tell you about her first. She's a sweet thing. Beautiful, too. Just like her mother. [Frasier finds the missing piece, gets up] Same cheekbones, same nose. "
"Frasier: What a lovely nose it is. "
"TO: Moira's room. "
"Moira: So there are four of us in the raft, and I see we're heading into a patch of white water. Suddenly, we slam into a rock, and the next thing I know my teeth are flying into the Colorado River. I damn near dived in after them. Those teeth cost more than the whole trip. "
"Roz: You've had quite a life. "
"Moira: I suppose. Never got arrested, though. Good for you. "
"Roz: It wasn't so great. Y'know, it was the first time I ever got pulled over and couldn't flirt my way past it. "
"Moira: Oh, that's almost as bad as the first time somebody calls you 'Ma'am.' "
"Roz: That happened the other day. It's been kind of a rough week. "
"Moira: I bet I know just what you're "
"thinking: this is only the beginning. It's only gonna get worse from here. "
"Roz: Well, yeah. "
"Moira: I'm eighty-one now. And every morning, I open my eyes and I see the sun streaming through the window. I hear the birds chirping, I smell the coffee brewing down the hall, and I walk into the bathroom and I look into the mirror. And do you know what I say to myself? "
"Roz: What? "
"Moira: AARGHHH "
"Roz: What the hell is that? "
"Moira: That's the second thing I say The point is, it is only gonna get worse from where you are right now. Well, what did you want me to say? 'Life gets better with every passing year?' You want to hear that, you go talk to Mrs. Adleman. You can't miss her. She's the one in the TV room with the inflatable seahorse around her waist. "
"Roz: Well you're not making me feel any better, Moira. "
"Moira: It's 'coz I can't. Nobody likes to get older. But it doesn't mean you can't enjoy yourself. I'll tell you a funny story. Last Thursday, I hacked into the main computer here and changed the schedule. So now, I get all my sponge-baths from Eduardo. "
"Roz: You're kidding me. "
"Moira: Look, you're way too young to be concerned about all this. Don't waste the best years of your life worrying about something you can't control. "
"Roz: I know. I know you're right. Y'know, I wouldn't care about getting older if I thought my mind was gonna be as sharp as yours is. "
"Moira: I'll tell you a funny story. Last Thursday, I hacked into the main computer here and changed the schedule. And now, I get all my sponge-baths from Eduardo. "
"TO: Norman's room. Frasier is searching the room for some glue. "
"Norman: With the exception of not being able to watch Willie Mays steal second, or Michael Jordan on a breakaway dunk, not a whole lot I feel I missed out on. "
"Frasier: Uh-huh. Ah, listen, you got any glue around here? "
"Norman: I don't think so. Why? "
"Frasier: Ah, the onyx has popped out of my cufflink and ahh, I was just hoping I might be able to re-affix it. "
"Norman: The closest thing I have is denture adhesive, it's on the dresser. "
"Frasier: Oh good, good. It's worth a try. [starts putting adhesive on the mask] "
"Norman: These pills may keep me alive, but they sure don't keep me awake. You find it? "
"Frasier: Yes. Yes, you know I think this just might do the trick. "
"Norman: You know, the worst part about all this is that I used to be the kind of person that never got tired. "
"Frasier: You know, perhaps we should take a brisk walk. Get that old circulation going "
"Norman: No, that's okay. It's close to my bedtime anyway. "
"Frasier: Seems like you have a visitor, Norman. "
"Norman: Come in... Come in... Probably Mrs. Adleman. She was an Avon lady before she lost her mind. "
"Frasier: You know, my goodness, that is a smashing robe. You know, I'm in the market for one like it myself. Why don't you stand up, maybe I can read the label. "
"Norman: Come over here and have a look. I seem to be sitting on something. "
"Frasier: Ooh My cufflink All right, you know, I'll just ahh, place it back in here carefully and... a-ha. Well, there we go. Good as new. Yes well ah, Norman, I can't tell you what a nice time it's been spending the day with you. "
"Norman: It was nice of you to drop by. "
"Frasier: My pleasure. "
"Norman: Oh, you're over there? "
"Frasier: Oh yeah, I was just having one last look at Helen. "
"Norman: Isn't she beautiful? Such delicate features. "
"Frasier: They certainly are. Well Norman, it was a real pleasure. I hope you keep listening to my show. "
"Norman: I sure will. You're a good man. Not a lot of people left with your kind of integrity. "
"Frasier: Norman, ah... I have a little confession to make. I didn't... I didn't drop your ashtray, I dropped the mask. The nose broke off. I feel just terrible. "
"Norman: Well, that's why you needed my denture adhesive? "
"Frasier: Yes. "
"Norman: Usually, it works pretty well. I must have dropped that mask ten times... I am blind, you know. "
"Frasier: Well, certainly is a relief to hear that. Well you know, I better get out of here before I do any further damage. It was great meeting you. Would you like me to leave the light on or off? "
"Norman: Surprise me. "

"Frasier: My eight year-old son is visiting me this weekend, he asked specifically if I could arrange a tour of the Microsoft complex, I was wondering what's your policy on... You know, I don't often trade on my celebrity status, but does the name Frasier Crane mean anything to you? I'm sorry to hear that. Well, erm, you know, it's entirely possible that one day a relative of yours may wish to tour my workplace... It's a radio station Forget it "
"Roz: If we'd even been close, that would be one thing, but I beat that pack by a mile A mile "
"Bulldog: Calm down, slugger, it's all right. "
"Roz: A mile "
"Frasier: I take it you lost the game. "
"Bulldog: No, we won the game, but Roz got kicked out for arguing with the ump She kicked dirt on his shoes, chest-butted him, almost took a bite out of his finger when he stuck it in her face. You can't coach that kind of thing. "
"Roz: All right, the guy on second, one guy's out, I drive one to the gap. The throw-the-cop man is late, our guy stays at home and I try to stretch it to a double. I make a beautiful hook slide right into the tag. How can I be out? "
"Frasier: I'm still trying to understand why you drove to the Gap in the middle of the game "
"Bulldog: I gotta go work on the line-up for Saturday's game. You know, I love being in charge. "
"Roz: Oh, can I play second base? "
"Bulldog: Er, no, sorry, Liz Budner's playing second. "
"Roz: Liz Budner? Why? What can she do that I can't? "
"Bulldog: It's what she will do that you won't "
"Frasier: Oh, Roz, erm, listen, didn't you used to date some executive at Microsoft? "
"Roz: Oh, Scott Blankman Ugh, talk about your messy break-ups. Even after I dumped the guy, he kept calling me. At first he'd make excuses - 'Oh sorry, I hit the wrong button on my speed dial' - and then he just gave up the pretense and there'd be sobbing on the other end of the line I finally said, 'Scott, I never, ever want to talk to you again' Why do you ask? "
"Frasier: I'd like you to give him a call. "
"Roz: What? "
"Frasier: Well, Frederick's coming to visit me this week. The only thing he asked for was a tour of Microsoft, and I sort of already, well, promised that I could arrange it for him. "
"Roz: Frasier, you're asking me to call a man who camped outside my apartment building and held a big sign up that said, 'Roz Doyle is afraid to love' "
"Frasier: I understand. I thought you'd be more sympathetic, that's all. "
"Roz: I can't. "
"Frasier: I do recall a story you told me not long ago, about a young girl living in Wisconsin who wanted desperately for her mother to drive her to Chicago to see Bobby Sherman open a shopping mall. But her mother was just too busy. And so what did that little girl do that night? She cried herself to sleep on her little Bobby Sherman pillow. "
"Roz: I hate you "
"Frasier: Niles. "
"Niles: Good morning, Frasier. Is Frederick up yet? "
"Frasier: Actually he went out with his grandfather for an early morning walk. "
"Niles: I went through some of my old albums this morning and found a few photos of us when we were Frederick's age. "
"Frasier: Oh, Lord. "
"Niles: I thought he might find them amusing. "
"Niles: Oh here, there we are, all dressed up for our first cub scout hike "
"Frasier: And the last "
"Niles: Yes, well, we didn't exactly endear ourselves to the pack. All the other kids had those knapsacks, we showed up with those monogrammed train cases. "
"Frasier: Niles, refresh my memory. Why are we wearing plastic snouts and a tiny little wading pool around our waists? "
"Niles: Oh, you've forgotten. That Halloween we went as 'The Bay of Pigs.' "
"Frasier: Ah Yes, as I recall nobody got it. We finally had to take to telling that we were 'Swine Lake.' They didn't get that either. That was a long evening. "
"Niles: So, what do you have in store for Frederick this visit? "
"Frasier: Well, we're going to go whale-watching, to the planetarium and Roz is helping me arrange a tour of Microsoft. It's the one thing that Freddie's specifically requested. "
"Niles: Someone's making a run for 'Dad of the Year.' "
"Frasier: Yes, well, you know how it is. I don't get to see him as often as I'd like. Memories of this trip will have to last until the next one. Can you blame me for wanting it to be perfect? "
"Freddie: Hi, Dad. "
"Frasier: Oh, hello, Freddie. "
"Freddie: Dad, did Grandpa ever tell you the story of how he captured four bank robbers with just a nightstick? "
"Frasier: No. He did tell me how he captured two bank robbers with just a revolver, his partner and a S.W.A.T. team. "
"Martin: They got there later "
"Freddie: Hello, Uncle Niles. "
"Niles: Hello, Frederick. My, aren't you getting big. "
"Freddie: I'm the same exact size I was the last time you saw me. "
"Niles: Well, your mother's cooking will do that for a growing boy "
"Freddie: Are we going to Microsoft today? "
"Frasier: Well, actually, Freddie, I thought we'd, er, go by the radio station, I could show you where I work. That'll be fun, won't it? "
"Freddie: Yes. When are we going to Microsoft? "
"Frasier: Well... Saturday. "
"Freddie: Excellent. "
"Daphne: Oh, good morning, Dr. Crane. "
"Niles: Good morning, Daphne. "
"Freddie: Hi, Daphne. "
"Daphne: Hello, Frederick. "
"Martin: Hey, Freddie, tell your dad what you saw in the park today. "
"Freddie: Hi, Daphne. "
"Daphne: Frederick's my boyfriend. "
"Niles: Oh, really? "
"Freddie: I've a present for you, wait here. "
"Martin: How cute, he's got a crush on you. "
"Frasier: Yes, you should have seen him last night. He spent the entire evening sitting on Daphne's lap watching TV. "
"Niles: Really? "
"Daphne: And this morning I heard this soft little knocking at my door and it was Frederick asking if he could climb into bed with me. "
"Niles: Really? "
"Freddie: This is for you. "
"Daphne: Oh, isn't this lovely? Look, here's Frederick and here I am. And what are we doing? "
"Freddie: Getting married. "
"Niles: "
"Daphne: Well, come on, Frederick. Let's go hang this on the fridge. "
"Freddie: Okay. "
"Niles: Frasier, do you really think it's healthy for a little boy to be so obsessed with a woman he can't possibly have? "
"Frasier: Niles, have you actually sunk so low as to be jealous of him? "
"Niles: No, I'm not jealous, I'm just a bit, well... maybe envious. "
"Martin: That's ridiculous What have you got to be envious of? "
"Daphne: Hold on "
"Freddie: Wheeeee "
"TO: "
"Frasier: And this is the booth where it all happens. "
"Freddie: Very impressive "
"Frasier: Well, this is the talk-back button here, if I want to talk to Roz, and this is the cough button if I want to mute the mike. Oh, and this button here's very special. It sends a death ray shooting from the phone of any caller who annoys me. "
"Freddie: You wish. "
"Frasier: Yes, I do. "
"Frasier: Well, okay, Roz, what have we done to ourselves today? "
"Roz: Well, we went out last night to celebrate our big win. I had a few margaritas. Someone started a conga line, I wasn't going to get in it but then Gary, our shortstop, got on the end of the line and that man has a butt that makes you want to reach out with both hands and... [Frasier spins Frederick round to face Roz] Give Freddie a big Seattle hug "
"Freddie: Good save, Roz. "
"Roz: Thank you. "
"Frasier: Freddie, I don't believe you've met Bulldog. "
"Bulldog: Hey, kid. "
"Freddie: Why are you called Bulldog? "
"Bulldog: Er, people have just always called me that. "
"Freddie: But why? "
"Bulldog: I don't know... "
"Frasier: Well, all right, Bulldog, er, Roz and I have a show to prepare... "
"Bulldog: No, no, wait a minute, this is important. Why do people call me Bulldog? There has to be a reason. [a woman enters to pick up some papers, Bulldog barks at her and she runs out] This is gonna drive me nuts "
"Roz: So who's going to sub for me in the game on Saturday, we've got to have a ninth body out there or we forfeit. "
"Bulldog: All right, er.... How about Mindy Guffrey? "
"Roz: Eight months pregnant. "
"Bulldog: July, August, September, October, November, December, January... "
"Roz: Anyway, you'd better find somebody else and speaking of bad news, Frasier, I finally got a call from Scott Blancman... "
"Frasier: Oh, Roz... Freddie, why don't you talk to Bulldog for a minute, I have to discuss something with Roz. "
"Freddie: Okay. "
"Bulldog: Yeah, no problem. "
"Bulldog: Oh, hey, hey, in a little while, I'm going to bring in my cart. You can hit the gong. "
"Freddie: Why? "
"Bulldog: It's loud, I make a lot of loud noises on my show. "
"Freddie: Why? "
"Bulldog: I don't know. Boy, I'm starting to get a headache. "
"Freddie: If you need a softball player, why don't you use my dad? "
"Bulldog: Oh, yeah, right. "
"Freddie: Isn't he good? "
"Bulldog: Oh, yeah, yeah, he's great, he is the best, you know. I wish he could play but I think your dad's busy Saturday. "
"Freddie: He's taking me to Microsoft. "
"Bulldog: Yep, yeah, right. Oh, man, I wish he could play because if he were playing we'd win for sure. "
"Roz: I'm sorry, Frasier, that's all I can do. Scott quit Microsoft right after we broke up. "
"Frasier: I don't look forward to telling Frederick. He'll be so disappointed. "
"Roz: Well, you know, if you want the tour of a cemetary, I've got an aunt there now. "
"Bulldog: I don't know, I give up. "
"Freddie: Abraham Lincoln What school did you go to? "
"Frasier: Frederick. "
"Freddie: Dad, I don't want to go to Microsoft anymore. "
"Frasier: You... don't? "
"Bulldog: Oh, hey, yes he does. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Hey, what kind of boy wouldn't want to spend a day at Microsoft? "
"Frasier: Stay out of this. Freddie... Frederick, you know, this is your vacation, you're the boss. Whatever you say goes. "
"Freddie: Great, I want to see you play in the softball team. "
"Frasier: What? "
"Freddie: You could take Roz's place. "
"Frasier: Well, I... You know, as much as I'd love to play softball, I really don't think that Bulldog wants me to. "
"Freddie: Yes, he does. He said you were the best. Right? "
"Bulldog: That's what I said. "
"Frasier: Well, thank you, Bulldog. "
"Freddie: So, you'll play? "
"Frasier: Well, I don't see how I can refuse. "
"Freddie: Great, I can't wait to tell Daphne. "
"Frasier: Oh, yes, well, speaking of Daphne. While you're waiting for Daphne, why don't you go out, get yourself a candy bar out of the machine. "
"Freddie: Mommy says candy rots tooth enamel. "
"Frasier: Yes, well, chew on the side of your mouth, rot your baby teeth. "
"Frasier: Bulldog, what the hell do you think you're doing, telling him I'm a good softball player? "
"Bulldog: Hey, I was trying to be nice. You want me to tell him you're a big lame-o? "
"Frasier: No, I don't. "
"Bulldog: Hey, look, I know how tough it is when you're a kid and you find out you're dad's not as great as you thought. Look, I was about Frederick's age when, well, I came home, my mom was out and I caught my dad with another woman. "
"Frasier: Oh, Bulldog, I'm sorry. "
"Bulldog: No, no, wait, you haven't heard the bad part yet She was ugly, doc. I mean coyote ugly. My own dad. And the best excuse he could come up with was, 'Hey, you don't look at the mail when you're poking the fire' Hey, I just got that "
"Frasier: I just keep thinking back to that time when Dad made us try Little League. I will never forget the humiliation of getting up to bat for the first time in my life and hearing the other team all cry out, 'Move in, everybody. Crane's up' "
"Niles: Yes, but they moved right back out again after you took your first swing. "
"Frasier: Only because the bat flew out of my hands "
"Niles: You worry too much, your co-workers aren't expecting you to play brilliantly. "
"Frasier: Oh, I can live with playing badly in front of my co-workers, it's Frederick I'm worried about. He's still at that age where he thinks his father can do anything. "
"Niles: Every child at some point must discover that his father is not a superhero. "
"Frasier: I know. "
"Niles: It's a healthy part of the developmental process. "
"Frasier: I know, I know some day he's going to have to learn that I'm not perfect, it's just that I was hoping it might be something less humiliating like seeing me fast dance at a family wedding. "
"Niles: You consider that less humiliating? "
"Frasier: Well... "
"Daphne: Hello, look who's here. "
"Frasier: Ah, did you two have fun while I was at work? "
"Freddie: Yes. "
"Daphne: Oh, yes, we went to the amusement park, we had a lovely time. Only I think the ferris wheel scared him a bit; he spent the whole ride hugging me for dear life. "
"Niles: Really? "
"Freddie: Her hair smells like strawberries. "
"Niles: It smells like peach blossoms, lavender and vanilla "
"Niles: "
"Freddie: Uncle Niles, are you coming to watch my dad play in the softball team? He's the best one on the team. "
"Niles: Well, of course I am, Freddie. I'll be there sitting right between you and Daphne. "
"Daphne: Oh, come on, Frederick, let's go get some hot chocolate. "
"Freddie: OK. "
"Frasier: So you see the problem? "
"Niles: I certainly do "
"Frasier: No, that's your problem. The trouble is that I promised Frederick I would play on Saturday. I guess I'm left with only one choice. "
"Niles: You're gonna fake an injury? "
"Frasier: No, of course not, I'm going to learn how to play softball. "
"Niles: In two days? "
"Frasier: Well, back in college, when Stu Oberfelt got sick, I learnt the role of Mercutio in just a day and a half. I was brilliant. Fighting in the duelling scene, the audience was on the edge of their seats. "
"Niles: Yes, and they were under them when the sword flew out of your hand "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Gee, Dad, I want to thank you for helping me out with this. "
"Martin: Ah, don't mention it, we're going to whip you right into shape "
"Frasier: It must have been kinda disappointing for you; I never took any interest in this sort of thing as a kid. "
"Martin: No, I understood. "
"Frasier: I guess it's a little complex I must have developed. When I was growing up, you know, the doorbell'd ring, I'd run to answer it and then there'd be the neighbourhood kids with their baseball gloves and their bats looking for somebody else to join their game. They'd say, 'Hey, can your Dad come out and play?' "
"Martin: Well, never mind that. You know, it's kind of fun to finally be out here. "
"Frasier: Oh, at the risk of sounding like Stanley courting Blanche DuBois in 'Streetcar...', 'We've had this date with each other from the very beginning.' "
"Martin: I knew you'd ruin it "
"Frasier: I'm sorry. "
"Martin: Come on, put your helmet on. "
"Frasier: Dad, gee, it's kinda tight. "
"Martin: Yeah, well, it's supposed too. Stops you from getting hurt. "
"Martin: There you go, now. Get your bat, get into the stands just like I told you. I'm gonna turn the machine on. You know, the good thing about these balls is that they're all at the same level so you can work on your form and your timing, all right? Okay, now here we go. "
"Frasier: What is that, a pitching machine or a particle accelerator? "
"Martin: All right, all right, I'll crank it down to a lower setting. Okay, now, just remember; Left elbow in, right elbow up, knees in, all your weight on the balls of your feet, okay, now, just step into the pitch. "
"Martin: Now. "
"Martin: Oh yeah, and swing the bat. "
"Frasier: Dad, can't you just slow it down a little bit? "
"Martin: All right, all right, but if any of the other fathers come back here, I'm taking it off the pee-wee setting. Okay, all right, now, from the hips. Nice an' easy, don't try to kill it, just try to make contact, okay, are you ready? "
"Frasier: Ready. "
"Frasier: What are they looking at? Dad, they're looking at me "
"Martin: Get out of here Go on, buzz off "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Did you hear that? Did you hear that? I touched it that time, I did "
"Martin: No, I think that was my knee cracking Hey, you're doing a lot better, though. That's six in a row without hitting yourself in your kidney on your follow-through. "
"Frasier: Oh, who am I kidding? This is hopeless "
"Martin: Oh, well you tried anyway. Why don't we just try changing bats? "
"Frasier: Oh, Dad, please, I couldn't hit that ball if I had a sofa cushion "
"Martin: All right, okay, Softball's not your game. It's no big deal, now Freddie'll understand that. "
"Frasier: Oh, I suppose. In time he well, it's just that... "
"Frasier: ...no boy ever forgets the first time he finds that his dad isn't perfect. It's not what I want him to take away with him on his trip. Anyway, thanks for your help. "
"Martin: Oh, don't mention it. So, Frasier, em, what was it for you? "
"Frasier: Huh? "
"Martin: Well, you know, em, when you first found out that I was less than perfect? "
"Frasier: I don't know. "
"Martin: I thought you said a kid never forgets the first time. "
"Frasier: Well... Maybe it was no one time. "
"Martin: Oh, so, it's a lot of times? "
"Frasier: Well, no, I'm just not very comfortable talking about it right now. "
"Martin: Why? You're not going to hurt my feelings, I'm just curious. "
"Frasier: All right, all right. Back in third grade, you took me and some of the boys from the Math Club out to pizza. When the check came, you couldn't figure out the tip in your head. "
"Martin: I can't do math in my head, that's your big disappointment? "
"Frasier: Well, it was at the time "
"Martin: Well, I wonder if I can calculate in my head how many hits you got today? Let me think, er... oh, it's zero "
"Frasier: Fine Fine, Dad, get defensive I was eight years old. "
"Martin: Hey, that's the one shaped like a snowman, right? "
"Frasier: I'm sorry I even brought it up. "
"Martin: All right. "
"Frasier: I guess I'm just going to have to bite the bullet, sit Frederick down on Saturday before the game and tell him the truth. It's not a conversation I'm looking forward to but I should prepare him for the fact that his daddy's not going to be hitting any grand slams on Saturday. Or am I? Wait, a grand slam is... "
"Martin: You aren't. "
"Frasier: Well, anyway, I suppose one consolation is, you know, as disappointed as I was with you after the pizza incident, here we are, all those years later, out at a batting cage. "
"Martin: Yeah, that's right. Come on, I'll get us a couple of beers. "
"Frasier: Thanks, Dad. "
"Martin: And, er, how many of these shiny things do you need for... "
"Frasier: Oh, shut up "
"Frasier: Hello, Niles. "
"Niles: Frasier, you look like an authentic jock. I'm half-tempted to hand over my lunch money. "
"Frasier: Is that your idea of appropriate baseball-watching attire? "
"Niles: Obviously you failed to detect the subtle diamond pattern in my tie "
"Niles: So, how did your little talk go with Frederick? "
"Frasier: Well, I haven't been able to bring myself to do it yet. I guess it's about you going to any lengths to avoid looking foolish in front of your son. "
"Martin: Look what Mrs. Thorkenson was throwing out. Boy, the guys at McGinty's are going to love this "
"Frasier: Well, anyhoo... "
"Frasier: Frederick, what have I told you about running in the house? "
"Freddie: You told me to not run in the house. "
"Frasier: Frederick, what have I told you about splitting infinitives? "
"Niles: Frasier, let the boy be a boy. "
"Daphne: Don't run away I saw you Your son just walked right in on me in the shower "
"Frasier: Frederick "
"Freddie: Dad, all I really saw was... "
"Frasier: I am very disappointed in you, young man "
"Niles: Let the boy finish "
"Freddie: All I really saw was a lot of steam. "
"Freddie: I'm sorry, Daphne, I didn't know you were in the shower. Now you hate me. "
"Daphne: I don't hate you, you just have to promise to knock before you enter a room, okay? "
"Freddie: Sorry, dad. "
"Frasier: That's okay, son. "
"Freddie: So, when are we going to the game? "
"Frasier: Er, in a bit, er... First we have to have a conversation, the two of us. Er, Uncle Niles, do you think you could give us a moment alone? "
"Niles: Oh, of course. I'll freshen up for the game. [aside to "
"Freddie:] You can fool them, but you can't fool me I'm on to you, little man "
"Frasier: Come on, Freddie. Come and have a seat, here. Okay, you're going to see me play some softball today, and I'm not going to play very well. You see, I'm not a good softball player. "
"Freddie: But Bulldog said you were the best. "
"Frasier: Yes, I know, he was just lying in order to be nice. The truth is, I stink. I can't catch, I can't throw, I can't hit. "
"Freddie: Oh. "
"Frasier: So, it must be pretty disappointing to hear for the first time that your Dad's not perfect, but... "
"Freddie: It's not the first time. You couldn't fix my computer, you thought Venus was the North Star, and I've seen you run "
"Frasier: Well, why didn't you mention any of these things to me before? "
"Freddie: I thought it might hurt your self-esteem "
"Frasier: Ah, actually, Frederick, I'm really okay with those things, I am. I just want you to know that it's okay for you to feel bad about them. You see, when I was your age, I felt really bad about learning that your Grandpa can't do math in his head. I learned later, of course, that that really wasn't very important because he can do so many other things so well. "
"Freddie: Grandpa can't do math in his head? "
"Frasier: Yes, but.... "
"Martin: What are you doing telling that for? "
"Frasier: I was making a point "
"Freddie: You mean you can't do it at all? "
"Martin: Well, yeah, sure I can, Freddie. "
"Freddie: I knew you could. What's seven times fifteen? You can do it, Grandpa. "
"Martin: Er... 115? "
"Freddie: Oh, Grandpa "
"Martin: Thanks a lot, Frasier "
"Frasier: Well, I tried, for God's sake. "
"Daphne: Ready for the game? "
"Freddie: Yeah. "
"Daphne: You don't sound too exited. "
"Freddie: I just found out that Dad's bad at softball and Grandpa can't do math in his head. "
"Daphne: Those things aren't important. What can I do to make you feel better? "
"Freddie: Maybe a hug? "
"Daphne: Oh, come here. "

" "
"Frasier: Niles. "
"Niles: I'm sorry to drop by unannounced, but I need your help. "
"Frasier: Of course. Sherry? "
"Niles: Please. As you know, ever since I moved into the Montana I've been angling to meet our most famous "
"tenant: Esmeralda Bing, the Walnut Queen. Well, I finally cornered her in the ornamental garden, by the wishing well, and I felt very pleased with myself - that is until the Walnut Queen invited me to a ball. Now I have a problem. "
"Frasier: Yes, your life has become an operetta. "
"Niles: No, it's a charity ball. And when I say invited, I mean she let me buy a table for ten at five thousand dollars. I've until Sunday to sell eight five hundred dollar tickets... "
"Frasier: Say no more. It's a bit steep, but if it's for charity... "
"Niles: Thank you Frasier, it is a very worthy cause. "
"Frasier: Alright, who should I make this out to? "
"Niles: The Esmeralda... Bing... International... Doll Museum. "
"Frasier: You do have a problem "
"Niles: I thought you prided yourself on supporting the arts "
"Frasier: The arts, Niles, not the crafts "
"Martin: I told you, I can't do it now. Sherry's taking me out for our third-month anniversary, and I've got to get a new sport coat. "
"Daphne: You cannot skip your exercises again - you skipped them yesterday. "
"Martin: This is the only time Sherry can go shopping with me and I can't go without her. There isn't a woman alive with her fashion sense "
"Niles: Carmen Miranda having passed on "
"Daphne: I should think having a lady friend would make you exercise more, not less. I don't mean to be indelicate, but a man in your condition who wants to enjoy certain, shall we say, indoor sports, should take steps to make sure that cranky old Mr. Hip doesn't, shall we say, let down the team, if you get my meaning? "
"Martin: Don't you worry about me. I may not be the rookie of the year any more but I can still move around the bases "
"Roz: Oh hey, Martin. "
"Niles: Oh look, a scout from the majors. "
"Martin: I'll see you later, I gotta run. "
"Frasier: Oh, this is a surprise. "
"Roz: Big news. Gertie Oldson is leaving the station. "
"Daphne: What, from 'Gertie's Grotbag'? I love that show. "
"Frasier: Oh please, that homily-spouting Hausfrau? It's the most embarrassing thing on the air. So, she finally got canned, eh? "
"Roz: No, she got a million-dollar TV deal. "
"Frasier: Well, good news for Gertie and for the many atheists who will welcome this new proof of their theory. "
"Roz: Anyway, they're auditioning people for her time slot and... I'm going to go for it. "
"Frasier: What do you mean - your own show? "
"Daphne: Roz, that's exciting. "
"Niles: And what better way to celebrate an exciting new career move than spending this Sunday at a swanky society ball? "
"Frasier: Drop it, Niles Of course, this comes as a little surprise. "
"Daphne: Yeah, I never knew you were interested in getting your own show. "
"Roz: Well, it's the whole reason I got into radio. I mean, I had my own show in college and when I started working at the station I kinda got stuck on the producing side. "
"Frasier: What kind of show did you have in mind? "
"Roz: I thought I'd talk about stuff I "
"know: the singles life in Seattle, dating, fashion, where to meet available men... "
"Niles: Well, if you're looking for an event which will be crawling with attractive single men, this particular ga... "
"Frasier: Niles "
"Roz: Anyway Frasier, I hope that you'll support me on this. "
"Frasier: Well, I'd hate to lose you, but of course I'll support you. "
"Roz: Oh thank you, Frasier, you're the best. "
"Frasier: Well... "
"Roz: Listen, as long as I've got you all here - I'm putting together an audition and I could use people to pretend to be callers... "
"Frasier: We'd be glad to help. "
"Daphne: Sounds like fun. "
"Roz: Alright, I'll come back tonight. Oh and Daphne, I need at least one spicy call. Could you pretend to be a woman who doesn't believe in sex without love, but just feels so horny sometimes she wants to jump anything in pants? "
"Daphne: Well, I'll try. And while I'm at it, I'll see if I can fake a British accent "
"night: Roz, Niles, Daphne and Frasier are sitting around "
"Roz: Good afternoon, Seattle. I'm Roz Doyle and this is 'Love Matters.' Today we're chatting with merchant seaman Steve Barron, from Billingham. Tell me Steve, what do you look for in an ideal date? "
"Frasier: When my shipmates and I pull into port after several weeks at sea... "
"Roz: Cut Sorry Frasier, but you don't sound like a merchant seamen. "
"Frasier: Oh, let's try again, alright? "
"Roz: So, Steve, what do you look for in an ideal date? "
"Frasier: When my shipmates and I pull into port after several weeks at sea, the first thing we do is... "
"Niles: ...head for the antique sale "
"Frasier: Fine, smarty pants. Well, you play Steve then. "
"Roz: Never mind, let's just go on to my next idea. Daphne? OK, you be the girlfriend of a couple who wants to spice things up in the bedroom. Niles, will you be her boyfriend? "
"Niles: Yes. "
"Roz: OK. I'm here with Fred and Patty. Tell me, you two, what made you think that your sex life needs a little jump start? "
"Daphne: It's all his fault. He just seems to have lost interest in me. I've done everything I can to entice him. I've... served dinner wearing nothing but high heels and an apron; I've called him at the office and talked dirty; and last night when he came home I was lying in bed wearing a whipped cream teddy But, did he care? No "
"Roz: And none of this turns you on, Fred? "
"Roz: Fred? "
"Niles: That's nothing, you should hear the other things that don't turn me on Tell me about it, Patty. "
"Roz: Let's cut to the chase. Patty, men are like "
"fish: when you first hook 'em they wriggle around like crazy, but once you finally reel them in they just lie there with that glassy look. "
"Niles: That's terrible advice. "
"Roz: No, it isn't. "
"Niles: Yes, it is, you have no idea how Fred really feels about Daphne... Patsy. "
"Daphne: Patty. "
"Niles: Patty "
"Roz: This is pointless. "
"Frasier: No, Roz, you're doing just fine. "
"Roz: No, I was terrible I wasn't helpful, I wasn't smart... I wasn't even sassy "
"Frasier: Well, perhaps not sassy but you were simply saucy, that borders on sassy. "
"Daphne: Hello, Mr. Crane. How was your romantic evening with Sherry? "
"Martin: Oh, it was fine. Er, hey Daph', how about getting that exercise mat out, we'll do some stretches, eh? "
"Daphne: Can't right now, I'm helping Roz with her audition tape. "
"Martin: Well, how long's it going to take? "
"Daphne: What are you so eager for? Oh, I get the picture. Not too limber with Sherry this evening, were we? Two hips but no hooray? "
"Martin: Very funny Well, you haven't exactly been burning it up in the romance department either. "
"Daphne: What do you know about my love life? "
"Daphne: I was lying in bed wearing a whipped cream teddy. But did he care... "
"to: Kitchen "
"Frasier: It takes some time to get the hang of it at first. But I mean, you should have heard my audition tape I was so inept it was incredible. "
"Roz: That's true "
"Frasier: Oh. Oh, you heard it? Well, then you see that... "
"Roz: There was a bootleg floating around the station for months "
"Frasier: Yes, well fine, so you get my point then... "
"Roz: People still play it at parties "
"Frasier: Alright, Roz. "
"to: Living Room "
"Martin: So, hey Roz, I hear you're trying out for a new job? "
"Roz: Yes, as a matter of fact I am. And you can really help me with my demo. "
"Martin: What do I do? "
"Roz: I just want an honest answer. I want to talk to you about first dates. "
"Martin: OK. "
"Niles: Are you sure dad's the best candidate for this particular subject? "
"Martin: Quick "
"survey: how many Crane men here with a girlfriend? "
"Martin: No, no, keep 'em up while I count. "
"Frasier: Alright "
"Roz: Great. OK Frasier, start the tape. Alright, we're here with Martin and we're talking about first dates. Martin, tell me some of the tricks you use to impress women. "
"Martin: Hmmm, well I'm sorry to disappoint you, Roz, but I really don't know any tricks. I mean, if a woman agreed to go out with me, I'd er, well, I'm not there to impress her or to play cool. I'm there because I want to know her; er, what she thinks; er, what she likes, so that if I'm lucky enough to get another date I can plan something that I know she'd like to do. I guess I'm still old-fashioned or something, but I think you should treat a woman like a queen. "
"Martin: Bow to the master, boys, bow to the master. "
"TO: "
"Bulldog: Hey, Bebe "
"Bebe: Bulldog Briscoe, my absolute favourite client. "
"Frasier: Hello, Bebe. "
"Bebe: And Frasier Crane - alert the judges, we have a tie "
"Frasier: Oh my goodness, what a flock. These all yours? "
"Bebe: Yes. The minute I heard about the auditions I piled all my hottest new discoveries into the van. "
"Frasier: You brought them in a van? "
"Bebe: I call it my 'Bebe Stars Of Tomorrow Tour.' People, I want you to meet Frasier Crane. "
"Frasier: Hello. "
"Bebe: The most caring and kindest client I've ever had. Frasier, this is Professor Pete, the human encyclopedia. Ask him anything, he can't be stopped. "
"Frasier: Oh, alright. Explain Freud's theory of the superego. "
"Pete: Sigmund Freud, noted psychiatrist, was born in Vienna. "
"Frasier: That's not what I asked. "
"Pete: He believed dreams had secret meanings. "
"Bebe: He just pulls it out of the air. But, if it's a raucous political debate you want, meet newlyweds Hank and Hannah Finch. "
"Frasier: Hello, Hank. "
"Bebe: He's a right-wing Baptist preacher, she's a fun-loving bisexual Conflicts? You bet Have you ever seen such talent? "
"Frasier: Well.. "
"Bebe: Ugh, they're pathetic "
"Roz: It went really well "
"Frasier: Oh Roz, I'm so excited for you. "
"Roz: You know what he actually said? At this moment I am the candidate to beat. "
"Frasier: Oh congratulations, Roz... "
"Roz: OK, I'm going to get set up for the show, I'm so excited. "
"Frasier: OK. "
"Bebe: Well, ra-ra for little Roz. "
"Frasier: Yes well, I'm really thrilled for her, I am, but... God knows where I'm going to find another producer. I feel so in sync with her. "
"Bebe: You know, Hank Finch produced hygiene films in the army. "
"Frasier: No, Bebe, I don't think so. Ah, I'm not proud to admit this, but there's a small part of me that hopes she won't get the job. God, I feel guilty just saying that. "
"Bebe: You're so good, everything makes you feel guilty. I'm so proud to represent you. You're like a modern day... what's his name? Pete, famous German doctor - built a hospital in Africa, Albert something? "
"Pete: Hang on. "
"Frasier: Schweitzer. "
"Pete: No. "
"Frasier: And that is it for our show today. But before I sign off, this final note to Carla who called us earlier from the planet 'Fripton.' The technical term for your condition, which eluded me earlier, is 'Schizophrenoform Disorder.' Or in layman's terms... "
"Roz: Hey, what's going on out here? "
"Frasier: Good Lord, is it someone's birthday? "
"Bulldog: Hey Roz, I hate to be the one to break it to you, but Brenda from the newsroom got the job. "
"Roz: Brenda? "
"Frasier: Oh, Roz. "
"Bulldog: It's total BS. Listen, er, if you need a little comforting later... Hey Brenda, alright [comes "
"back:] I'm there for you. "
"Frasier: Roz, I'm so sorry. "
"Roz: Oh hell, I'll be OK. Guess I better go congratulate the winner. "
"Frasier: Right. "
"Frasier: Bebe, did you hear what happened to Roz? "
"Bebe: Yes, no need to thank me, darling. "
"Frasier: What are you talking about? "
"Bebe: I spoke to the station manager - I told him just how you'd feel if he gave Roz the job. "
"Frasier: In here. "
"Bebe: I said that Frasier Crane wasn't about to work for a station that would steal his producer away. A bluff, of course, but he crumbled like a matzo. "
"Frasier: Oh, how could you? I told you that I didn't want to lose Roz, but I didn't mean for you to sabotage her "
"Bebe: You didn't? Oh no, what a horrible misunderstanding. "
"Frasier: I mean it "
"Bebe: Oh, I see. So when you said in that off-handed way that you hoped Roz wouldn't get the job... I totally misinterpreted you. "
"Frasier: Will you stop winking My God, I could never want such a thing There's got to be some way I can still reverse this "
"Roz: Oh that was fun, I got to watch Brenda sign her new contract "
"Bebe: Roz, I think what they did to you is monstrous. [Frasier can't believe her lies] I wish I could stay here and console you, but my people are waiting for me in the van. I hope someone cracked a window "
"Frasier: Listen Roz, this is something we need to talk about... "
"Roz: Oh Frasier, I know what you're going to "
"say: that I tried my best, that I deserved it. I'm fine with this, really. Yeah, I gave it a shot, that's what counts. I didn't get it. It's not like.... my life is over "
"Roz: Oh look at me, I'm so busy feeling sorry for myself I haven't even thanked you for all your help. "
"Frasier: That's not necessary. "
"Roz: Oh, it is Look how close you helped me get, it's because of you I'm second choice. "
"Frasier: I can't argue with that There's something I need to confess to you. As much as I hoped that you would get the job, there was a very small part of me - and a very selfish part - that hoped you wouldn't. "
"Roz: That's not bad. That's really kinda sweet. "
"Frasier: Oh, I'm glad you feel that way. Because I happened to mention those feelings to Bebe. "
"Roz: Bebe? You told Bebe? "
"Frasier: Just in passing. "
"Roz: Oh, great. She torpedoed me, didn't she? "
"Frasier: Yes... well, she said I'd quit if you got the job. "
"Roz: I can't believe this "
"Frasier: Well, I'm glad to see that you're as mad at her as I am. "
"Roz: I'm mad at you "
"Frasier: Me? "
"Roz: How could you have done that? "
"Frasier: Well, it was just an offhand remark, how did I know how she'd react? "
"Roz: She's Bebe If you had said you liked my eyes, they would have been on your desk tomorrow in a Tiffany box "
"Frasier: Oh Roz, I'm so sorry. Just tell me how I can make it up to you. I promise I will. "
"Roz: You mean it? "
"Frasier: Yes, anything, just name it "
"Roz: Fire Bebe. "
"Frasier: Well, em, how... isn't there something else you'd like? "
"Roz: The only thing I wanted was that job, and she took it away. I'm not just suggesting this for my sake - I'm suggesting it for yours. She is your representative. When she goes out into the world lying and twisting your words and stabbing people in the back, it reflects badly on you. "
"Frasier: You're right, Roz. How can I consider myself an ethical person when I have the Princess of Darkness conducting my business for me? Well, that's it, I'm going to have to fire that conniving harpy. "
"Roz: I'm very proud of you. "
"Frasier: I'm ashamed to think how long I've turned a blind eye on her unscrupulous behaviour. What for? A 20% pay increase... six-week paid vacation... an expense account... a travel allowance... "
"Roz: Frasier? "
"Frasier: Well, not anymore "
"TO: "
"Vera: Frasier Crane's here. He's not alone. Have a seat. "
"Bebe: Frasier, Roz, my two favourite people. "
"Roz: Not for long. "
"Frasier: Bebe, we're going to discuss what happened this morning - this time you won't wink your way out of it "
"Bebe: This is serious, you two come right in - we'll solve this thing. Let's just promise to be totally honest with each other. "
"Bebe: We're losing one. Code red "
"Bebe: What can I get you? Champagne? "
"Roz: Nothing. "
"Bebe: A massage? "
"Frasier: No, thank you. "
"Bebe: You sure? Vladimir can be here in five minutes, he will play your spine like a Steinway. "
"Roz: Can we just get started? "
"Bebe: Roz, I'm just a wreck about our misunderstanding today. Will you ever forgive me? "
"Roz: No. "
"Bebe: Why should you? I don't forgive myself. "
"Frasier: Bebe, what you did today was unfair, and not just to Roz but to me. "
"Frasier: Thanks to you, a strain has been put on our relationship... both professional and... personally. All of this I might be able to let go of as an isolated incident, but... I am concerned that... [narked off about the pill "
"taking:] Are you quite alright? "
"Bebe: It's nothing, it's just a silly little cardiac thing. [to "
"Vera:] Go, go, you're distracting my client. My clients come first. "
"Roz: Oh, poor Bebe, how many fake pills do you have to take everyday? "
"Frasier: Yes, do you really think that you can sit there popping a bunch of... Digitalis Oh my God You really are sick. "
"Bebe: Well, of course I'm sick. But it makes me even sicker to think that I've angered your will when all I wanted to do was keep the best damn team in radio together "
"Roz: Oh God, we're gonna need a shovel to get out of here "
"Frasier: Alright Bebe, be that as it may, but I still... "
"Bebe: What about my sister? One second. [into "
"phone:] Did the air bag deploy? Look, I'm gonna to have to call you back. Frasier's here, and my clients come first Sorry, you were saying? "
"Frasier: Since the moment we met you showed yourself to be ruthless and untrustworthy. As these are qualities I do not wish to have associated with my name, I think it's best we simply part... "
"Bebe: What did I say about calls? "
"Girl: Aunty Bebe. "
"Bebe: Susy. Sorry to hear about your mummy's accident. "
"Girl: I'm frightened, Aunty Bebe. "
"Bebe: Don't be, little one. "
"Girl: If mummy goes to heaven, will you take care of me? "
"Bebe: Of course, my little lamb, assuming that I have the resources. "
"Frasier: Bebe, you know I can't help noticing that none of your outside lines are lit up "
"Bebe: I'm going to have to go. I'm with a client and you know what we say about clients. "
"Vera: They always come firth. "
"Roz: You are amazing "
"Frasier: Is there nothing you won't stoop to? "
"Bebe: I had no idea who I was speaking to [to "
"Vera:] How dare you impersonate my niece? I've had enough of your cruel jokes - you're fired, mother "
"Bebe: I just want to say... "
"Frasier: No, stop it Not one more crooked word Your tongue could open a wine bottle. From now, Frasier Crane has resigned from your coven. "
"Bebe: Huh That's it, is it? I'm not virtuous enough for you, not noble. Fine, quit Next time you need a deal made, call the Dalai Lama. A long time ago, I had to make a choice between being a good agent and a good person, because trust me, you can't be both So forgive me if I don't have time to make everybody warm and fuzzy. I am just too busy spending every waking minute pouring any drink, pulling any shameless tricks I can to make my clients' dreams come true I am a starmaker And if you can't appreciate that, there are plenty that can How about you, you want an agent. "
"Frasier: Oh pu-leeze "
"Roz: You mean it? "
"Frasier: Roz "
"Roz: I've never had an agent. It's not like she worships the Devil. "
"Frasier: Well, she doesn't have to He worships her "
"Roz: You're absolutely right, Frasier. Forget it, Bebe. No way "
"Bebe: That voice - I could listen to it all day. It's pure, yet smouldering - like a nun with a past. "
"Roz: You think so? "
"Frasier: No, Roz, don't look her in the eye "
"Bebe: I could triple your salary - voice-overs, commercials... "
"Frasier: Roz, listen to me, for God's sake. If you've got the tiniest shred of sense or dignity left, remember what this woman did to you this afternoon and renounce her. She has no scruples, no ethics, and no reflection "
"Roz: Oh, let's get out of here. "
"Frasier: Well, nice doing business with you. [pauses, then obvious and "
"nasty:] WINK "
"Roz: Oh Frasier, I forgot my purse. "
"Frasier: Alright. "
"Roz: Lunchtime tomorrow? "
"Bebe: 12"
":30, Benardi's. "

"Frasier: You know I've only got a moment, you know I've started a very exciting project. "
"Niles: Oh really? "
"Frasier: Yes, you know this is KACL's fiftieth anniversary. I did a little research and found out they used to specialise in live radio dramas. So, I'm putting one on. Dad, surely you must remember those? "
"Martin: Oh sure. "
"Frasier: Yes, people of dad's generation would sit around at night, listening to the radio absolutely mesmerised. "
"Martin: We were simple people. "
"Frasier: All right, dad. Anyway, I've spoken to the station manager. He's given me thirty minutes, to re-create the very first mystery KACL ever aired; 'Nightmare Inn.' "
"Martin: Oh don't tell me, I "
"know: A bunch of people get caught in a storm, and everyone's wondering who's going to be the first one murdered. "
"Frasier: Exactly, and I'm going to direct. "
"Niles: So, we can stop wondering. "
"Martin: What, don't you think your brother knows how to direct? "
"Niles: No, the trouble is he doesn't know how to stop directing. During our prep school production of 'Richard III' he drove the entire cast crazy with his constant critiquing. I seem to recall a delay on the opening night while our Richard chased Frasier around the dressing room, beating him with his hump. "
"Frasier: Oh, that was just a little backstage horseplay to relieve tension. "
"Niles: You'll have an Orson Welles complex. By the end of this week, you'll not only be directing, you'll have re-written the script and be playing the lead. "
"Frasier: I have no intention of performing in it myself. The only re- writing I've done is simply cutting to get it down to thirty minutes. "
"Martin: 'Frasier Crane's Nightmare Inn.' "
"Frasier: It's just a working title "
"Frasier: Well, that's our show for today, but let me remind you to tune in on Saturday night for KACL's presentation of 'Nightmare Inn.' Just set your dials for goosebumps. Till then, this is Dr. Frasier Crane reminding you that [in a ghoulish creepy voice, which sounds down-right "
"hilarious:] you never know what's lurking in the shadows. "
"Roz: Well, that should certainly comfort the woman who called in about her paranoia. Listen, do we have a leading man yet? "
"Frasier: No. "
"Roz: Well, you could do it. "
"Frasier: Oh don't be silly, Roz. It is a juicy part, it does call for a strong voice, but believe me, my hands are full. "
"Gil: Oh, Frasier, I've had a quick peek at your script and I think I'd be perfect as Bull Kragen, the brutish gamekeeper. "
"Frasier: You know Gil, I think that's just a bit too on the nose. But you know who you could play? Mr. Nigel Fairservice, drummed out of the Royal Air Force under mysterious circumstances. "
"Roz: With him playing it, they might not seem so mysterious. "
"Gil: I'll take it. After all, Nigel does have that divine speech in the second act about his boyhood in Surrey. 'Romping with his school chums in the fens and spinneys, when the twilight bathed the hedgerows like a lambent flame.' Actually, I had rather a long peek at the script. "
"Roz: Gosh, we still have a lot of these supporting roles to cast. "
"Frasier: Well actually, I'm working on that. You know, Jennifer down in accounting is married to a professional actor, who specialises in dialects. I'm thinking of asking him to play six or seven of the smaller parts. "
"Bulldog: Hey Doc, need one more for your play? "
"Frasier: Absolutely Bulldog, just as long as you promise to promote it on your show. "
"Bulldog: Actually I wasn't talking about me, I was talking about a friend of mine; Maxine. "
"Frasier: Does she have any experience? "
"Bulldog: Are you kidding? If she had a dollar for every minute she spent on stage... Oh wait a minute, she does. "
"Frasier: Well, we do still have a part open for the maid, she only has one line. "
"Bulldog: Does it have any big words? "
"Frasier: No, it's simple; 'Look out, he's got a gun' "
"Bulldog: Maxine could knock that line right out of the park. "
"Frasier: Well, OK, but you've got to agree to play a part too. We still need someone for the sinister silk merchant. "
"Bulldog: OK, it's a deal. Maxine is going to be so excited. I gotta remember to pick her up one of those cute little French maid outfits on my way home from work. "
"Frasier: It's radio, Bulldog, she doesn't have to appear in costume. "
"Bulldog: Maybe here she doesn't "
"Roz: Well, we're getting there. "
"Frasier: Except the lead I haven't found anyone remotely qualified to play a wily old Scotland Yard inspector. You know, you might be right, Roz, I'll have to bite the bullet and take on the part myself. "
"Ian: Excuse me, Dr. Crane, is it too late to read for role of the inspector? "
"Frasier: I'm afraid the role has already been cast. "
"TO: "
"Daphne: Come on in. "
"Roz: Hello, Daphne. "
"Gil: Hello. "
"Frasier: Bulldog, Gil, right on time. We have to be on our toes tonight, we have a professional actor with us, Mel White, our man of a thousand voices. "
"Gil: Oh, it's a huge pleasure. "
"Frasier: Mel's going to play Hans the German butler, both McAllister sisters, and Pépo the dwarf; a little man with a big secret. "
"Bulldog: The same guy's playing all those parts? "
"Frasier: Yes, he's also playing Bull Kragen the game keeper, and O'Toole the handy man. Do you think you're up to it, Mel? "
"Mel: Just so long they don't all talk at once "
"Frasier: Isn't it lovely to be working with a professional Bulldog, where's Maxine? "
"Bulldog: Oh, she's home with food poisoning, it's nothing serious. I think she just wrestled in some bad Jell-O. "
"Frasier: Never mind, she just has one line anyway. Look out, he's got a gun You think you might be up to that this evening, Daphne? "
"Daphne: I'll try "
"Gil: Frasier, one of Nigel's lines seems to be missing. "
"Frasier: Why yes, I had to cut the play by twenty minutes. "
"Gil: Oh yes, but that line so neatly defined Nigel's character. "
"Frasier: Saying 'Gesundheit' after the butler sneezes? "
"Gil: It shows he's a caring person. "
"Frasier: It's cut, Gil. Learn to let go. "
"Gil: Oh very well, as long as I still have that delicious speech about my boyhood in Surrey. "
"Frasier: Yes that's still in. "
"Gil: 'Romping with my school chums in the fens and spinneys...' "
"Frasier: Yes, yes that one. Thank you. All right, I fear we might be running just a bit long still, so I've asked Daphne to time us this evening and also Noel hasn't rounded up all the sound effects yet, so I'm gonna have Daphne read those directions as well. Now that's a lot of responsibility on you Daphne, are you sure you're up to it? [She looks at him as if to say 'I have some use'] All right, start the watch. Stage direction. "
"Daphne: Sound of door opening. "
"Roz: Inspactar, thank goddies cam. "
"Frasier: Stop the watch. Roz, I have a line here that says, 'when she opened her lips I caught a hint of some mixed exotic accent.' You will notice it does not say, 'when she opened her lips cheese fell out'. Start the watch. This is a grisly business, Miss Thorndike. "
"Daphne: Sound of door closing. "
"Roz: I can't believe any of my guests could be a multiple murderer. "
"Frasier: That's easy for you to say, but my job is to suspect everyone. Please introduce me to your guests. "
"Roz: This is the silk merchant, Mr. Wang. "
"Bulldog: "
"Frasier: Stop the watch. What's your problem? "
"Bulldog: Wang? You've gotta give me another name, I'll crack up every time I hear that "
"Frasier: All right, all right, how about Wing? That's a great old Chinese name. Everybody change Wang to Wing in your scripts. "
"Daphne: Sound of people changing Wangs to Wings. "
"Frasier: From your line. Start it. "
"Roz: This is the silk merchant, Mr. Wing. "
"Frasier: Do you see anything suspicious, Wing? "
"Bulldog: Oh, me no looky, me go very by chop-chop. "
"Roz: Stop Chinese embassy on line one You can't say that. "
"Frasier: All right, it's all right, I'll just adjust his dialogue later. Start. "
"Gil: I'm Nigel Fairservice, inspector. I was strolling in the garden when this dreadful tragedy occurred. "
"Frasier: Did anyone see you? "
"Gil: Several people. Hans, the German butler. "
"Mel: Ja, I saw zee Gentleman. "
"Frasier: Stop That's wonderful, Mel. But he sounds to me just a bit more Austrian than German. "
"Mel: I've done that accent both on Broadway and the London stage "
"Frasier: Yes, well perhaps they have different standards than I have. All right everyone, from the beginning once again. Now let's try hard people, dig in And try to find the reality. From the dwarf's entrance. "
"Frasier: 'And so the case was closed, and with a grateful shudder, I swore I'd never return to Nightmare Inn.' Stop. Time? "
"Daphne: That's 32 minutes, 40 seconds "
"Frasier: Damn I'll have try to pin some more before we try again. "
"All: Again? "
"Frasier: Please, we're doing it until I'm completely satisfied, and that reminds me, Mel - I'm still not entirely happy with the second McAllister sister She doesn't sound spinsterish enough for me. "
"Mel: I see. You also told me that my gamekeeper sounded too cultured, that my Irishman sounded more Protestant than Catholic, and that my dwarf was too tall. Let me try Hans again, tell me how my German is "
"sounding: 'I Q-vit' "
"Frasier: Oh, wait "
"Daphne: Sound of door slamming. "
"Bulldog: So what do we do now, boss? "
"Frasier: Not to worry, I have a plan. "
"Roz: Oh yeah right, we're supposed to do this thing tomorrow night. Where are you going to find an idiot willing to take six dialect parts unrehearsed? "
"Frasier: Niles. "
"Daphne: Sound of ominous organ music indicating trouble ahead. "
"Time: 9"
":15) "
"Gil: Oh there's your brother, how's he enjoying the prospect of playing six parts? "
"Frasier: Actually, he doesn't know about it yet. He would have never agreed. "
"Niles: Frasier, you told me you were going to message the script to me this morning. "
"Frasier: I'm so, so sorry. I was tinkering with it till the very last minute, but not to worry. Your natural talent will carry you through. Look, take a look at this. [they walk to Noel beside a bench with strange objects on] Noel is going to give us a demonstration of the sound effects. What have you got, Noel? "
"Noel: OK This is my door "
"sound: My thunder "
"screen: And this plays various kinds of organ "
"music: I've also got a gravel box, bells, a rain stick and a coffee thermos. "
"Frasier: What does that do? "
"Noel: It keeps my coffee warm. "
"Bulldog: Everybody, this is Maxine. "
"Frasier: Hello. Welcome. "
"Maxine: Hi, I need a quiet place to work on my part. "
"Bulldog: Oh, you got it baby, why don't you go up here in the booth. "
"Frasier: Bulldog, work on her part? It's just one line. "
"Bulldog: Yeah, yeah, but she's got that condition. What d'ya call it, it begins with a dis... dis- dis... er? "
"Niles: Distemper? "
"Bulldog: No, Dyslexia, that's it. She's dyslexic. "
"Frasier: And you tell me that now. "
"Bulldog: No, no, no, hey, she'll be great. It's me I'm worried about, I've got some serious butterflies going here. "
"Frasier: Bulldog, you're on the radio all the time. "
"Bulldog: Yeah, but that's me being me. This is acting, it's scary. "
"Frasier: Listen, that's all part of the thrill of the live performance. Butterflies in the stomach, sweaty palms, scratchy throat, pounding heart I suppose you have all of those? "
"Bulldog: I do now "
"Roz: Phorry I'm late, Phaser, I just sphent two hours in the dentist chair. An emergenphie, Ohh. "
"Gil: What is the matter? "
"Roz: Novocaine, he said it would wear opph by now. I keep biteing my 'ip. "
"Frasier: Dear God, we've got sixty seconds. "
"Niles: I don't even know who I'm playing. "
"Frasier: Don't worry Niles, I'll just cue you as we go along. "
"Niles: Shouldn't I at least prepare a little? "
"Frasier: Now, listen, your natural spontaneity is your best asset as an actor. What was it the Yale 'Daily News' said about your Tartuffe? "
"Niles: Oh, who remembers? That I have the magnetism of Marlon Brando, the charm of Danny Kaye and the range of Laurence Olivier. "
"Frasier: All right everyone, places please. "
"Daphne: Hurry up, it's starting. "
"Frasier: Good evening, this is Frasier Crane to welcome you to KACL's recreation of the original mystery theatre... "
"Daphne: I already know the plot, but I'll try not to blurt out the name of the murderer. "
"Martin: Great As a cop I hated it when people did that. "
"Frasier: In all my years at the Yard, I doubt I'd ever seen a fouler night than that on which I was called out to investigate a double murder at the old inn on the moors. The door was answered by Miss Carlotta Thorndike. Her face was unfamiliar and when she opened her lips I caught a hint of some exotic accent. "
"Roz: Inphector, ow Phank God you ca'. "
"Frasier: This is a grisly business, Miss Thorndike. "
"Roz: I can't beweive any of my guests cod be a... mopible mupuder. "
"Frasier: That's easy for you to say. But my job is to suspect everybody. Please, introduce me to your... no, no, never mind. I know your guests by reputation. This must be Mr. Wing, the silk merchant. Did you witness anything suspicious, Wing? [Bulldog freezes on the spot so Frasier covers] Of course, the inscrutable and mute Mr. Wing, who wears a bell on his hat. Did you witness anything suspicious, Wing? No, eh? I'll remember you said that. "
"Gil: I'm Nigel Fairservice, Inspector. I was strolling in the garden when this dreadful tragedy occurred. "
"Frasier: Did anyone see you? "
"Gil: Several people. Hans, the German butler. "
"Niles: Ja, I saw zee gentleman. "
"Gil: O'Toole, the gardener. "
"Niles: It ‘twas himself, and no mistake. "
"Gil: As well as Prudence McAllister. "
"Niles: Yes, I was taking a breath of air. "
"Frasier: I tried to shake Nigel's alibi, but each witness was adamant. O'Toole "
"Niles: Faith and it's true "
"Frasier: Hans "
"Niles: Ja, Voll "
"Frasier: Miss McAllister "
"Niles: Oh, please hence. "
"Frasier: There remained one suspect, whose whereabouts had not yet been established - Pépo the dwarf, a retired circus performer. Exactly where were you when the murders occurred, Pépo? "
"Frasier: Pépo, where were you? "
"Niles: I was at the movies. "
"Frasier: At the movies you say, well one quick phone call can verify that "
"Frasier: What's this? Dear God, the phone lines have been cut. Oh, we were really stranded. Totally and completely isolated from any contact with the outside world. "
"Frasier: The phone lines have been repaired, you say? [uses prop phone] Hello? Wait, they've gone dead again. "
"Frasier: Who knows what other surprises this night may bring? "
"Martin: I don't remember the plots of these things being so goofy "
"Daphne: Mr. Wing wasn't mute last night. "
"Niles: Six different roles and six different accents, I have a mind to walk right out of here. "
"Frasier: Yes, I'm sorry, Niles, but you're doing brilliantly. Except your Hans could be a bit gruffer "
"Niles: Don't direct me "
"Frasier: I'm sorry, you're right. I'm just a bit more worried of being over time. Gil, at the bottom of page fourteen, listen, after your shot just say 'I'm dying,' cut the rest. "
"Gil: That's my boyhood in Surrey speech "
"Frasier: Yes, I know. "
"Gil: You can't cut that, you can't. "
"Frasier: Stop whining We've got a play to do "
"Gil: I don't care anymore. "
"Frasier: Oh, all right, please, quiet everybody. Ten seconds Oh, Maxine, be sure to watch out for your cue and please, people let's pick up the pace. Nightmare Inn, Act Two. I was baffled, they all had alibis. Suddenly Miss Thorndike pointed, her eyes wide with alarm "
"Roz: There's somevon outside that phindow. "
"Frasier: Why yes, Miss Thorndike, it appears to be... [soft music plays sounding like a fairy, Frasier covers] The ice-cream truck But never mind that, suddenly the storm put the lights out. And we were left with darkness. Then a scream. "
"Maxine: Ahhhh Look out, he's got a nug "
"Frasier: A gun A gun is what he's got. When the lights came back up, a smoking gun lay on the table. The maid lay dead, unable to name her killer. Nigel Fairservice lay mortally wounded. "
"Gil: I'm dying "
"Frasier: Poor man was gone. "
"Gil: Never again to visit the scene of my boyhood in Surrey, romping with my school chums in the fens and spinneys... "
"Frasier: Just then the lights went out again. Nigel Fairservice was shot again. "
"Gil: Only grazed me. When the twilight bathed the hedgerows like a lambent... "
"Frasier: The final bullet, blew his head clean off his shoulders. All right people, let's try to keep calm although it's hard when the killer is among us. "
"Gil: Hi-ho, I'm Nigel's brother Cedric, who I haven't seen since my boyhood... "
"Frasier: And so died the last surviving member of the Fairservice family. "
"Martin: Boy, I sure didn't see that one coming "
"Gil: Hello, I'm the ice cream man. Years ago I went to school with Nigel Fairservice. We used to romp in the fens and spinnies... "
"Daphne: This is turning into a blood bath. "
"Martin: This is why I prefer TV, you want to be able to see that stuff "
"Frasier: By this time, I was more baffled than ever. So I played a hunch; Hans, may I see your fingernails? "
"Niles: Vy? "
"Frasier: They seem a bit ragged for a butler "
"Niles: Alvight, Alvight, I'm not what I appear. None of us is. I'm not a butler, I'm not even... German? Sit down, inspector, you are about to hear a fascinating tale. Each of us holds a piece of the puzzle to relate to you. When we've finished you will know the full dark secret of 'Nightmare Inn' "
"Roz: Are thu thew with phat, Hans? "
"Niles: Be quiet, mother. Mother and I moved here when I was a small boy after the... tragic death of my father... "
"Niles: I kept the pain of that loss buried deep within me like a serpent coiled within a damp... cave... That's it I'm just going to take this gun off the table. Sorry about that, O'Toole, I guess we'll never hear your fascinating piece of the puzzle. Or yours, Kragen and Pépo Could the McAllister sisters stand back to back, I'm short on bullets Thank you What was your name again, dear? "
"Roz: Miph Thorndike. "
"Niles: Thank you. Ah, and also Mr. Wing. [shot sound with bell fading] And of course, one final bullet for myself so the mystery will die with me. Ha "
"Frasier: Well then, that pretty much wrapped things up Hans was a mass murderer, who to the surprise of everyone, the case was closed. And with a grateful shudder, I swore I never would return to Nightmare Inn "
"Frasier: Well, we still have nine minutes remaining. Perhaps we could have a little post-play discussion? "
"Time: 21"

"Niles: Have you noticed there are fewer hazlenuts in these biscotti? "
"Frasier: So I'm not crazy. "
"Niles: And yet they've gone up twenty-five cents. "
"Frasier: Oh, fewer nuts, more money - something I've been aspiring to for my entire professional life "
"Roz: That's the last time I jog in these shorts. My thighs are chafing like a couple of hams wrapped in velcro Non-fat Mocha, please "
"Roz: What? "
"Frasier: As flattered as we are that you've chosen our company over, say... a shower, perhaps you'd like to go to the ladies room to freshen up a little bit? "
"Roz: Hey, at least I try to keep in shape. I haven't seen one of you two run an eight minute mile "
"Niles: Stand upwind of us and you might "
"Frasier: Oh, by the way Niles, my benefit for the Seattle Theatre Ensemble is tonight - I haven't recieved your check yet. "
"Niles: Well, that's because I'm still not sure if I'm coming. Whom should I expect to meet there? "
"Frasier: Professional people... around our age.. "
"Niles: Hmmm. "
"Frasier: Same social standing... "
"Niles: Yoww "
"Frasier: Specific-minded... interested in the arts... "
"Niles: Oh for God's sake, how many women? "
"Frasier: Well, why didn't you say so? "
"Niles: Well, I thought my rutting monkey body language would have tipped you off. "
"Frasier: Well, pertaining to my RSVP list there should be quite a few available women. "
"Niles: In that case I'll be there. [writes check and hands it to "
"Frasier:] Here's my money - it better be worth my while "
"Frasier: Oh look, here comes Sherry and Dad. "
"Niles: Duck "
"Frasier: No, no, no, no, I invited them. "
"Niles: Sherry's not going to be there at your benefit tonight, is she? I can stop that check "
"Frasier: Oh, just relax. I came up with a rather ingenious plan to occupy their evening - I bought tickets to an event which is right up their aisle. I felt so mortified just buying the tickets, I paid cash so they couldn't trace it back to me. "
"Waitress: Excuse me, people Did somebody leave some tickets back here? "
"Frasier: Oh, good Lord Yes "
"Waitress: Something called, 'Nashville on Ice' "
"Frasier: Right here. "
"Waitress: 'Ice skating country jamboree.' "
"Frasier: Oh, don't look so smug - try skating and blowing into a jug while your heart's breaking "
"Sherry: I can't believe you scored tickets to that. You are well- connected in this town. "
"Frasier: Well, actually these are gifts for you and dad. "
"Sherry: Oh, that's great. "
"Frasier: I hope you're free. "
"Martin: Well, we are now Wow, Frasier, thanks. Look at this, rink side. "
"Sherry: Oh, what's that on your cheek? "
"Sherry: My lips "
"Niles: Oh, look at the time, I have to go. "
"Sherry: Oh, it seems that everytime I see you, you're just leaving. "
"Niles: Yes, and I'd love to stay but I... have my therapy group meeting... and last time I was late the, er, compulsive gamblers were betting the passive/aggressors that they couldn't make the overeaters... cry. "
"Martin: Well, you two take a seat here, I'll get us a couple of coffees "
"Sherry: You know how I like it - hot and sweet. "
"Martin: Yeah, but how do you like your coffee? "
"Sherry: Is he always that funny? "
"Frasier: Oh, yes. "
"Roz: That damn soap dispenser - I just gave it a good tap and splat "
"Frasier: Oh, I'm sorry. Roz Doyle, my producer, you haven't met my dad's inamorata, Sherry Dempsey. "
"Roz: I normally look a lot better than this "
"Sherry: Oh now, you don't have to be self-conscious around me, hon. We all have our bad days once we pass forty Nice seeing you. "
"Roz: What did she say? "
"Frasier: Oh, who cares? The least I can do to lengthen out a few precious moments of silence without her underfoot. The woman's practically moved in with me. "
"Roz: What did she say? "
"Frasier: Be calm now, come on. You may not look your best today but there's a man sitting right over there - he can't keep his eyes off of you. "
"Roz: Oh, where? "
"Frasier: Right over there. "
"Roz: Oh my God, that's John Coughlin from my high school Oh dear God, please don't let him recognize me. I swear I'll never leave the house unbeautiful again "
"John: Roz? "
"Roz: Thanks for listening "
"John: Roz Doyle? It's me, John Coughlin. "
"Roz: Hi John, look at you. "
"John: Look at you "
"Roz: I hardly recognised you with that moustache Oh Frasier, I'm sorry. This is John Coughlin, Frasier Crane. So did you just move to Seattle? "
"John: No, I'm out here for a week on business - now it's back to Wisconsin. Remember Marcy? "
"Roz: Yeah. "
"John: She's getting married on Saturday. "
"Roz: No kidding "
"John: Well, I'm late for a meeting but it was great running into you, I can't wait to tell the whole gang I saw you. "
"Roz: You don't have to do that "
"Roz: Frasier, that guy was the biggest gossip in my home town. He saw me with my hair all sweaty, my sweatshirt full of soap Oh God, what could be worse? "
"Frasier: Well, here's a "
"hint: Got Milk? "
"Roz: Oh, no "
"Frasier: At first, I was terribly nervous about hosting these things, but it seems to be going rather well. "
"Niles: Not for me. I haven't made in-roads with a single woman here. "
"Frasier: What are you doing? You look nauseated "
"Niles: That woman is flirting with me, this is my 'I'm available' face. "
"Frasier: Stop it My God, people'll think the shrimp is bad. Alright, which one? "
"Niles: Er... at nine ó "
"clock: blonde hair, blue dress. [the woman heads toward them] Oh, now ten ó clock... 11 ó clock... oh Mama, high noon. "
"Adair: I'm sorry, I have to leave early. I just wanted to let you know what a lovely time I had. "
"Frasier: Oh well, thank you, it's good to see you. Have you met my brother, Dr. Niles Crane? "
"Niles: Enchanted. "
"Adair: Hi. Are you feeling okay? "
"Niles: "
"Adair: Oh. I so enjoyed our chat about Brecht, I'm just sorry we didn't get to finish it. "
"Frasier: Oh, me too. "
"Adair: Um... I never do this - but if you'd like to give me a call sometime, I'd like that. [gives him her card] You don't have to call me, only if you want to, and we can talk about other, non-Brecht things... you see why I never do this? "
"Frasier: Well, I'm certainly glad that you did it with me. "
"Adair: Nice meeting you, Miles. "
"Niles: Okay. "
"Daphne: Dr. Crane, who's that gentleman over there? "
"Frasier: Oh, that's Matthew Apinnion - he's one of the theatre's biggest benefactors. "
"Daphne: Well, I just caught him back in my bedroom. "
"Frasier: Well, I'm sure he just wandered in there by mistake. "
"Daphne: He was trying on my shoes "
"Frasier: Interesting piece of information. Something tells me that the theatre's going to get that new sound system. "
"Kimberly: On behalf of Seattle's Theatre Ensemble, I would like to thank Dr. Frasier Crane, for hosting tonight's benefit. But before we say goodnight, let's try and coax him into saying a few words. "
"Frasier: Alright. Er... Alexander Pope once wrote that the theatre 'aspires to wake the soul by tender strokes of art, to raise the genius and to mend the heart.' I'd like to say that it's my privelege to help ensure the survival of this noble calling. And, er, thank you all for coming and I'll see you on the opening night of 'Run For Your Wife' "
"Leslie: Well, that was terrific. Are you always this eloquent? "
"Frasier: Oh well, hardly. My Muse, alas, is somewhat ephemeral. "
"Leslie: Well, Dr. Crane, I'm glad to meet you. Leslie Wellman, we met earlier. "
"Frasier: Leslie, of course. "
"Leslie: Well, I have to run but... I hope I'm not being too forward - I'd love it if you'd give me a call sometime. "
"Frasier: I'd be delighted too. "
"Leslie: Here's my card. "
"Frasier: Thank you. "
"Frasier: Niles, was that Natalie Spencer I saw you talking with? "
"Niles: As a matter of fact it was. I've been admiring her all evening, so I steeled myself and asked her if she would be free next week. "
"Frasier: And? "
"Niles: Well, her lips said 'no' but her eyes said 'read my lips.' I suppose you came over here to gloat because a woman came onto you. "
"Frasier: Not hardly, I wouldn't do that sort of thing. I came over here to gloat because two women came onto me "
"Niles: Two? "
"Frasier: My God, I've never had a night like this in my entire life I'm a babe magnet, I'm catnip "
"Niles: I think I feel a fur ball coming up. Tell me your second conquest wasn't that haughty filly in the white dress - Kimberly Egan. "
"Frasier: No, no, no, your path is clear. "
"Niles: Oh... what's the point? I can't take another rejection "
"Frasier: Well Niles, I'll tell you what. Seeing as how Cupid has so amply stocked my quiver this evening, I shall try and shine on your behalf. "
"Niles: Oh my God, you're unbearable "
"Frasier: Kimberly, good evening. "
"Kimberly: Frasier. Thank you again for tonight. You really are a wonderful host. "
"Frasier: Thank you. Listen, I don't usually do this sort of thing but there's a gentlemen here tonight who's rather taken with you. He's an eligible doctor, he's just a bit shy about coming over and expressing those interests to you. "
"Kimberly: Well, you tell your bashful friend, he needn't be so coy. I'd love to go out with you some time, Frasier. Call me tomorrow. "
"Frasier: Oh, do you know my brother? "
"Kimberly: Oh, of course I do. Nice seeing you again, Miles "
"Doug: Anyway, Dr. Crane, I've spent months now sending out resumés, pounding the pavement, but nothing. "
"Frasier: Well Doug, it's possible you're simply going through a dry spell. Good Lord, it happens to all of us. Months go by with nothing, then completely out of the blue you get not one but three offers, without doing anything. Not just for any jobs either, but for desirable ones, with ample salaries and fabulous perks. Be patient. Finding employment is much like dating - opportunities come along when you least expect them. "
"Doug: Thanks, Dr. Crane. Actually, dating is the one area I don't have any problems in. Right now, I've got two women interested in me. "
"Frasier: Two? Well, that must make you the envy of MOST men Well, that's all for today, Seattle. This is Dr. Frasier Crane, KACL 780. "
"Roz: Alright, you've compared dating to unemployment, claustrophobia and bedwetting. Is there anything you'd like to tell me? "
"Frasier: Ask me if I'm free this weekend. "
"Roz: Well, obviously... "
"Frasier: Roz, ask me, come on. And let me remind you, it's a three- day weekend. "
"Roz: Are you free this weekend? "
"Frasier: No, I have a date this evening. And I've got a date tomorrow night. Oh, and let me check my calendar for Sunday. [checks "
"it:] Oh yes, another date "
"Roz: Good, not bad "
"Frasier: Not bad? If I didn't know better, I'd say someone was a little jealous. After this weekend you may have to give up your dating crown "
"Roz: I once had three dates on a single Saturday and still had time to defrost my refrigerator and rotate my tires. "
"Frasier: It's a wonder you could rotate anything after that Alright, I concede. "
"Roz: Alright, good. Will you help me with something? "
"Frasier: Sure. "
"Roz: Okay, do you think it's weird to send a wedding present to someone you haven't seen or spoken to in eighteen years? "
"Frasier: Well, it's a bit unusual but it's sweet nonetheless. "
"Roz: Okay, what about if the wedding gift happens to be a sterling silver picture frame, and inside that happens to be a glamour photo of me? "
"Frasier: Roz, does this have something to do with an old high-school chum you ran into yesterday during your holiday from hygiene? "
"Roz: I know, it all sounds so silly to you, but you don't understand. Frasier, I group up in a tiny town and I still care about what those people think of me and John Coughlin will go back there and totally trash me "
"Frasier: Come on, you're a beautiful, intelligent woman. Do you really care what impressions people in your past have about you? "
"Roz: I guess not. "
"Frasier: Hello? Why-y-y, Norm Peterson, you old horse thief Thanks for calling back so soon. Well... just guess who's got three dates this weekend "
"Daphne: Hi, is this Johnny's Steakhouse? Yeah, I'd like a table for two at eight ó clock. Sure, no problem, I'll hold. "
"Frasier: What the hell are you doing? "
"Daphne: Making dinner reservations. "
"Frasier: Not that, the voice. "
"Daphne: I'm trying my American. "
"Frasier: You're certainly trying this American "
"Daphne: Anything on the patio? Alright, cool. I'll see you then. "
"Daphne: You see, I'm just sick of people making such a fuss about my accent. I like to be able to blend in on occasion, so I'm learning to speak American. "
"Frasier: And who is your tutor, a drag queen? "
"Daphne: You know, it's not very kind of you to mock me. Especially after I've agreed to clear out for your big date. "
"Frasier: Yes, alright, thank you, Daphne - very much. "
"Daphne: You see, that's the problem when I speak American, I don't know what to do with my 'R''s "
"Frasier: Try hauling it out of here "
"Frasier: Kimberly, hello. "
"Kimberly: Hello. Frasier, it's so nice to see you again. "
"Frasier: Oh, well let me take your things. "
"Kimberly: Thank you again for hosting the benefit. "
"Frasier: Oh, well thank you again for chairing. Listen, did we make as much money as we hoped to? "
"Kimberly: Well, we haven't tallied all of it but I'm guessing the evening will exceed our wildest expectations. "
"Frasier: My favorite sort of evening. "
"Kimberly: Oh, I can admire this view for hours. "
"Frasier: Here we are - some wine, perhaps? "
"Kimberly: Thank you. "
"Frasier: To... Possibilities. "
"Kimberly: So, tell "
"me: how did you become interested in the theatre? "
"Frasier: Well, actually I first caught the acting bug back at prep school. The very first production I ever did was 'A Mid- Summer Night's Dream.' Not to toot my own horn but my Bottom recieved a standing ovation. "
"Kimberly: I'm not surprised. "
"Frasier: And you? How did you get involved? "
"Kimberly: Well, I worked in a lot of charities. I actually founded one that promotes pet adoption. "
"Frasier: Really? "
"Kimberly: I'm quite the dog lover. You? "
"Frasier: Heavens, yes. You know, I have dream of some day owning a big house in the country where I can have as many dogs as I like. "
"Kimberly: I just love a man who loves animals. Is it too much to ask that you are also a vegetarian? "
"Frasier: I just recently became one "
"Martin: Hey, Fras'. The pharamcy left your ointment with the doorman. "
"Sherry: Somebody has a date Don't worry honey, it's just for prickly heat. "
"Frasier: Well, thank you, Sherry. Kimberly Egan, this is my father Martin Crane, and this is his companion Sherry Dempsey. "
"Sherry: Can I tempt you to some Peppermint Schnaps? It really settles the tummy. "
"Frasier: Yes, as much as I could use that right now, I think I'll pass. "
"Martin: Oh hey, sweetie, tell them that joke you told down at the bar. When she told it I did an honest-to-God spit take. I'm not kidding you. So much beer gushed out of there I was like Mt. St. Pauliga. "
"Frasier: Well, actually I don't think... "
"Sherry: Okay, this really horny 80 year-old man goes into a confession box... "
"Martin: You're not Catholic, are you? "
"Kimberly: Yes, I am. "
"Martin: Oh, then you're really going to love it "
"Sherry: So anyway this horny old guy... "
"Frasier: You know, Sherry, I think we've both heard this joke. "
"Sherry: Ohhh, Marty, I think we're cramping somebody's style. Oh hey, before I forget, this is for you. I couldn't finish my veal chops. If you want to know the way to this man's heart, that is his favourite dish. "
"Kimberly: Veal? "
"Frasier: Free range "
"Martin: Well, hey listen, we're just going to take the dog for a walk. Eddie? Eddie?? "
"Martin: Oh, you locked him in the back room again, didn't you? "
"Kimberly: What? "
"Martin: Oh, listen to him He's crying, that poor little thing. "
"Kimberly: Well, I guess you'll need a lot of extra room in that dream house to lock up all those dogs. "
"Frasier: Good, we can joke about this. Kimberly, please, can I at least call you in a few days? "
"Frasier: Go ahead "
"Sherry: Good morning, handsome. "
"Martin: Yeah, hi. I was wondering when you were getting up. Hungry? "
"Sherry: Well, a litte bit. How about some Chinese? "
"Martin: Chinese for breakfast? Who eats that? "
"Sherry: About a billion Chinese people. "
"Martin: Alright, I'll get the plates and forks. "
"Sherry: Look, why don't we do it authentic this time. Get the chopsticks "
"Martin: No, I don't want to. "
"Sherry: Come on. "
"Martin: I don't feel like it. "
"Sherry: Oh, just try it one time - it's not hard. "
"Martin: It's not a question of hard - I just don't like using them, they don't work. "
"Sherry: Well, they've been around a lot longer than forks. "
"Martin: Well, our hands have been around a lot longer than that, why don't we just eat everything with our fingers? "
"Sherry: Oh, somebody's in a mood "
"Martin: I'm not in a mood. "
"Sherry: You are. "
"Martin: Look, I just don't like you telling me to do things that I really don't want to do "
"Sherry: Fine, I will never mention the word 'chopsticks' again. [to "
"herself:] So touchy "
"Martin: Thanks for taking what I said so seriously "
"Sherry: Marty "
"Frasier: So, Sherry's not there for longer than thirty seconds and she chases Kimberly right out of the apartment. "
"Daphne: Gee, I'm sorry, Dr. Crane. That woman sure can be difficult. "
"Frasier: Look, this accent thing's getting downright annoying Well anyway, I've been trying to call Kimberly all day to apologize... "
"Frasier: What are you doing? "
"Daphne: Saying hello to Mr. Hicks in security. "
"Frasier: There's a hidden camera up there? "
"Daphne: Yes, but he said don't worry about it. He said lots of people pull down their pants to tuck in their shirts. Though he did recommend having that rash looked at. "
"Frasier: Oh "
"Frasier: Oh fine, Sherry's still here You know, she stays later each morning and more nights each week It's not what I had in mind when I moved in here. It's bad enough I have to deal with Eddie and Dad and... their shenanigans "
"Sherry: I can't believe you're getting upset over nothing. "
"Martin: Well, I don't consider it nothing. "
"Sherry: I think we should talk about this. "
"Martin: I dont want to talk about it. "
"Sherry: To not talk about it is just plain stupid "
"Martin: Oh, so I'm stupid now, am I? "
"Frasier: They're arguing. Could there be trouble in paradise? "
"Daphne: This is awkward. Should we let them know we are here? "
"Frasier: No, they might stop "
"Martin: When did you get back? "
"Frasier: Just now. "
"Sherry: Oh, well don't worry, we were just talking. "
"Martin: We're finished talking. "
"Sherry: Maybe you have. Marty, I think we should talk about it. "
"Martin: Well, I don't want to. "
"Frasier: I've never heard them talking like that before. Dare I get my hopes up? "
"Daphne: Don't count on it. Once an argument moves into the bedroom, a woman can always get the man to make up. "
"Frasier: I wouldn't be so sure about that. "
"Daphne: Oh come on "
"now: men and women have been having this conversation for centuries. The woman always says, 'do we always have to fight?' "
"Frasier: Well, the man would say, 'well it's your own fault, you started it "
"Daphne: Can't we at least talk this out? Come on, sit with me on the bed. "
"Frasier: I don't feel like sitting "
"Daphne: Do you have to be so cold? "
"Frasier: Well, you made me angry "
"Daphne: You could at least put your arms around me "
"Frasier: Oh Daphne, I'm sorry... "
"Frasier: You're right. We're made up already. "
"Daphne: Well, at least they'll be in a good mood when they come out. There's nothing like make-up sex. "
"Frasier: Daphne, please, Sherry and dad don't have make-up sex. "
"Daphne: Well of course, they're probably at it... "
"Frasier: My dad and Sherry do not have sex "
"Sherry: So long kids, it was nice knowing you. "
"Frasier: Did that actually just happen? "
"Daphne: I guess I called that one wrong. "
"Daphne: Is everything alright? "
"Martin: Oh yeah, fine, it was a long time coming. "
"Frasier: Are you okay with this? "
"Martin: Well yes, I mean I'm not jumping up and down but I think it's better for both of us - yes. "
"Frasier: Are you sure? "
"Martin: Yeah, yeah, Sherry and I had a lot of laughs but you know there's a lot of things about her that bugged me, and Lord knows I'm sure she was bugged by a lot of things that I did. So, well, no really, this is fine. Fine. "
"Daphne: He seems to be taking it very well "
"Frasier: Perhaps I should go see if he feels like talking about it. "
"Frasier: Hello? Oh yes, hi, Niles. Well, actually it isn't a very good time. No, well dad and Sherry just broke up. He seems to be taking it okay, I guess. Oh no, I don't think it's appropriate. Well, it's just too soon for us to be celebrating right now. "

" "
"Daphne: Dr. Crane, are you alright? "
"Frasier: Daphne, shh... do you hear that? "
"Daphne: What? "
"Frasier: The sound of a Sherry-free apartment. I've been basking in it for the last thirty minutes. Right now, I feel like a seafront village after the Vikings have left. "
"Frasier: That must be Niles "
"Niles: Frasier. "
"Frasier: Niles. I'd offer you a sherry, but I'm fresh out "
"Niles: I can't believe Dad finally came to his senses Oh, shall we attempt a high-five? "
"Frasier: Well no, not after what happened last time - your watchband got caught in my hair. "
"Niles: What a relief to finally have things back to normal. "
"Frasier: Yes. "
"accent: "
"Daphne: Hey there, Dr. Crane How's tricks? "
"Daphne: I'm trying my American accent. "
"Niles: Well, stop it I mean, we Americans are sensitive about our... crude speech patterns. "
"Daphne: I'm sorry, I didn't mean to offend. "
"Niles: No, no it's quite alright. You have a real flare for accents. Just out of curiosity, have you ever tried a saucy French chamber maid? "
"Frasier: Niles "
"Niles: Frasier's just been telling me how well Dad's been taking the break-up with Sherry. "
"Daphne: Yes, a little too well if you ask me "
"Frasier: Daphne, we had this discussion already - he's fine "
"Daphne: He's in a lot more pain than he's letting on. You just don't see it because you like having your apartment back. "
"Frasier: Leave the complex analysis to the professionals "
"Martin: Oh hi, Niles. Feel like going to the movies with me and Daphne? "
"Niles: Oh thanks, but I have plans. Listen Dad, I'm sorry to hear about you and Sherry "
"Martin: Oh, that's alright. There's nothing to be sorry about. It was kind of fun to go back to my old bachelor days. Yeah, don't worry about me. Easy come, easy go. Do you want a blowmaker? "
"Niles: No, thanks. "
"Martin: More for me, I should bake a few of those for the movies, you know- "
"Daphne: Mr. Crane... "
"Martin: Come on, I'm only kidding. No, it's kind of fun to laugh at things again. That was the problem with "
"Sherry: she had no sense of humor, just a real stick in the mud, you know? Well hey, we better get going, don't want to be late - I'll get the elevator "
"Daphne: Well, what's your diagnosis now? "
"Frasier: It's a clearcut case of Post-Sherry Euphoria "
"Frasier: Oh, there's my canapés. "
"Niles: Oh, right. Date number two. I'll be off as well. You can fill me in tomorrow. "
"Frasier: You'll get a full debriefing - As, hopefully, will I. "
"Frasier: Alright, young "
"animal: learn from the master Now, bottle these time-honored traditions, and you too might get lucky with that young Pekinese peach you've been eyeing in the park. [holds up a "
"CD:] Now, for "
"mood: Vivaldi. And then, for "
"lighting: not so bright as to show the wrinkles, not so dark as to make her think you're hiding anything. [plays with the lights as the doorbell "
"goes:] Oops, and leaving nothing to "
"chance: Pouisse Fuisse 1992 - elector a la carte. Dear God, I could teach a course "
"Frasier: Adair. Come in, may I take your coat? "
"Adair: Thank you. It's so nice of you to have me over. I hope you didn't go to any trouble. "
"Frasier: Oh, nothing special. "
"Adair: I guess I feel so strange. I mean, one night I'm at Dr. Frasier Crane's house for a benefit - two days later I'm back at his house for a date. "
"Frasier: Well, there's one thing I've learned - that life is nothing without spontaneity. "
"Frasier: Come and have a look at the city. "
"Adair: Oh, what a lovely view. I didn't fully appreciate it the other night. "
"Frasier: My sentiments exactly. "
"Frasier: Here, a glass of wine. Here we are. To... Possibilities. "
"Adair: I wonder if I can see my apartment from here? "
"Frasier: Well, if you can, don't tell me. I have a telescope and I'm not to be trusted "
"Adair: Funny, charming... next thing I'm going to find out that you're a great cook. "
"Frasier: Well, don't get your hopes up [showing her his prepared "
"meal:] Duck confit. "
"Sherry: Hello, Frasier. "
"Frasier: Sherry. Er, my father's not here right now. I'll tell him you stopped by. "
"Sherry: Oh wait, I just came by to pick something up. "
"Frasier: Well, why don't you tell me what it is, I'll have it messengered over tomorrow. "
"Sherry: It's my banjo Can't I have it? "
"Frasier: Alright, listen, I'm on a date here. So just try to make it quick. "
"Sherry: Okay. Hi, how are you? "
"Frasier: She's fine, we're fine, go on. "
"Frasier: Father's ex-girlfriend. Well, where were we? "
"Adair: Let me just say that this duck is superb. And the way the wine compliments it and the music... I'm guessing you entertain often? "
"Frasier: Well, no, actually. I'm really rather lonely. Tell you what, take my telescope home, you can see for yourself. "
"Sherry: Got the banjo. "
"Frasier: Oh well, yes, okay, bye-bye. "
"Sherry: Bye, Frasier. It was nice seeing you again. "
"Adair: I'm sorry, have we met? "
"Sherry: Well, yes, on your date last night. Kimberly, isn't it? "
"Adair: No... "
"Frasier: Well you got what you came for, off you go... "
"Sherry: I'm sorry hon', but she does look just like the other girl, and besides you were playing the same makeout music- "
"Frasier: Alright, off you go "
"Frasier: Some more wine? "
"Adair: Two dates in two nights isn't bad for someone who's lonely. "
"Frasier: My God, you could hardly call what happened last night a date. The woman who organised the benefit came by, she just dropped in to say thank you. "
"Adair: Wait a minute. You mean Kimberly Egan? She broke up my first marriage "
"Frasier: Well, I hardly know the woman, she spent all of ten minutes here "
"Adair: I'm not going through this again. "
"Frasier: Adair Listen, listen, this is all in your mind I mean, we spent one night together, she means nothing to me "
"Adair: Gee, where have I heard that before? "
"Frasier: Go ahead "
"Frasier: So, for the second time in two nights Sherry manages to chase away another date She's like a scarecrow in the cornfield of my love life "
"Niles: I don't know how many more of your disastrous love stories I can hear. I'll say 'when.' "
"Roz: Hello. "
"Niles: You look like an almost presentable version of someone who works with my brother. "
"Roz: Bite me "
"Niles: Oh, it is you. "
"Roz: You haven't seen my high school friend John around here, have you? "
"Frasier: Well no, we haven't, Roz. I suppose you finally tracked him down? "
"Roz: Yeah, I'm meeting him here for coffee. I'm going to tell him I'm on my way to a chic cocktail party. This is the 'Roz' I want him to talk about when he goes to that wedding this weekend. "
"Frasier: The vain, neurotic, lying Roz? "
"Waitress: Oh, are you Roz? "
"Roz: Yes. "
"Waitress: There was a call for you from a John Coughlin; he said he's sorry that he can't meet you but he had to take an earlier flight. "
"Roz: Oh, great "
"Waitress: Roz Doyle, right? "
"Roz: Yeah. "
"Waitress: Sorry, you don't look anything like he described on the phone. "
"Roz: All right, before I do anything crazy - like, go to the airport, fly to Wisconsin and crash a wedding - did I really look that bad the other day? "
"Sherry: Hiya, guys. "
"Frasier: Oh hi, Sherry. "
"Sherry: Gee, you look familiar. Did I see your older sister in here the other day? Oh, she must be jealous of you "
"Cafe: "
"Roz: TAXI "
"Sherry: Mind if I join you? "
"Frasier: Oh, of course not. "
"Sherry: I was hoping that I'd catch you here. Well, I've been thinking about what happened yesturday between your dad and me and well, I just can't figure it out. One minute we were having a stupid argument about chopsticks and the next minute we were broken up. Well, I hate to put you on the spot like this, but did he say anything to you? "
"Frasier: Well, not really. You know how closed up Dad is. Well, he did say that the breakup was a long time coming. "
"Sherry: Now I really am confused I mean, I thought everything was going fine. Well, better than fine... Ah, the other night we both said 'I Love You' for the first time. "
"Niles: You did? "
"Sherry: Yes. "
"Niles: It's just that in the past he's been rather reserved about expressing himself that way. "
"Sherry: Well, I guess he sort of hesitated before he said it, but, I mean, a lot of guys do that when you spring it on them for the first time. "
"Frasier: Yes, well I certainly can tell why you're confused. Well... if you'd like, I could speak to him on your behalf. [Niles kicks him under the table] Ow "
"Niles: Oh, I'm sorry, is that your shin? "
"Sherry: No thanks, Frasier, I don't want to put you in the middle of this. I'm just frustrated. Listen, er, thanks for listening. "
"Frasier: Of course. "
"Niles: Anytime. "
"Sherry: Well ,I really thought I'd hit the jackpot with Marty. It isn't easy finding someone you think the world of. Oh, I know, you go tom-catting around with a different girl every night, but you can't find happiness that way. "
"Frasier: I haven't so far. "
"Niles: OW I didn't kick you that hard. "
"Frasier: You didn't have to kick me at all "
"Niles: Well, were you seriously considering playing couples' therapist with Dad and that woman, after we just got rid of her? "
"Frasier: I have no intention in repairing the rift. God, last night for the first time in months I wasn't jolted awake at two a.m. by her rousing rendition of 'Funky Mountain Breakdown' It seems a little odd that Dad chose to break up with Sherry just after he told her he loved her. "
"Niles: As I recall she said, 'hesitantly said it back to her.' To me that's a clear picture of a man who didn't share her feelings. "
"Frasier: Yes, well I think he does share her feelings. He just panicked out of fear. "
"Niles: Fear of what? "
"Frasier: Well, lots of "
"things: change, commitment, becoming vulnerable to someone again. I'm just afraid he broke up with her for all the wrong reasons. "
"Niles: Well, if he'd like a list of the right reasons it's available on request. "
"Frasier: The least I can do is have a talk with him. "
"Niles: No, the least you can do is nothing. Dad hasn't asked for our help. You should just let nature take its course. It's like one of those wildlife films with the lion chasing down the antelope. You don't ask why the photographer doesn't interfere - you just accept it "
"Frasier: As a general rule Niles, the photographer is not related to the antelope "
"Niles: Obviously you and I don't see eye to eye. [Frasier gets up to "
"leave:] Where are you going? "
"Frasier: I have a date in forty-five minutes, and a bleeding antelope sitting in a Baracalounger in my apartment "
"Niles: I suppose that sounded strange to you - I'd be happy to explain it. Are you by any chance free at the end of your shift? "
"Waitress: "
"Niles: I've still got it "
"Frasier: Not so fast, Mr. Hicks. You won't find me doing anything foolish. "
"down: "
"Frasier: Daphne. "
"Daphne: Hello, Dr. Crane. Enjoy your evening. "
"Frasier: Yes, you too. "
"Daphne: He's been under a lot of stress lately. "
"Frasier: Oh Dad, listen, I'm glad you're home. We've gotta talk. "
"Martin: I can't think which conversation started that way "
"Frasier: We have to talk about you and Sherry. "
"Martin: Why? Look, I'm fine with it. Come on now, let it go. "
"Frasier: Dad, listen, I spoke with Sherry today. "
"Martin: You did what? What for? "
"Frasier: Well, she came to see me. She was a bit confused about what happened the other day and well, from her story, I think what you're contending with here is a classic case of panic induced by fear of commitment. "
"Martin: Did you hear that, Eddie? That's who buys your dog food "
"Frasier: Yes, well she also told me about a little incident that took place the other evening, where she expressed her feelings for you and you hesitantly reciprocated. "
"Martin: Oh jeez, she told you about that? Look, to cut it "
"short: she told me how she felt about me, I said it back, but I only said it because I felt I had to. That's not really what I feel, so, end of story. "
"Frasier: Well, listen Dad, there's my date. I'm sorry for butting into your life but I happen to be concerned about you. You may find it hard to believe but your welfare happens to be very important to me. "
"Sherry: Hi, Frasier. "
"Frasier: Ah, Sherry. "
"Sherry: Hi, Martin. "
"Martin: Hey. "
"Sherry: You left your Sinatra tape in my car. "
"Martin: Oh thanks, I've been looking for that. "
"Sherry: Well, there you go. Bye. "
"Martin: So long. "
"Frasier: I saw that, Dad I saw the way you looked at her. You can't convince me you don't feel the same way about her that she does about you "
"Martin: I appreciate what you're doing, I really do, but STOP "
"Frasier: Alright, fine, it's your life. I wouldn't interfere. "
"Frasier: Wait, can you just stay for a few minutes? I think I can straighten this whole thing out. "
"Sherry: Oh, it sure didn't look like he wanted to. "
"Frasier: Yes, well he's just being his stubborn, ornery self. "
"Sherry: I do miss that "
"Frasier: Alright, I'll just go and talk to him. Stay here. "
"Leslie: Frasier. "
"Frasier: Oh, Leslie. "
"Leslie: Sorry, I'm a little early. "
"Sherry: Way to go, Fras' "
"Frasier: Oh, dear God. Sherry, this is Leslie; Leslie, Sherry. Leslie, come on in. "
"Sherry: Frasier, can I use the girl's room? "
"Frasier: No Oh, no... need to ask. "
"Frasier: May I take your coat? Yes, there we are. You see, Sherry is my father's lady friend and they're going through a bit of a rough patch. If you'll excuse for just a moment, I have to talk with him. Just a minute... "
"Leslie: No, take your time. I can always chat with Sherry "
"Frasier: No, no. I mean, look at this fabulous sunset, isn't that something? "
"Leslie: Wow. Even more stunning than I remembered. "
"Frasier: Yes, it is Excuse me for a minute... Oh wait, some wine? "
"clink: "
"Frasier: To... possibilities. "
"Frasier: Oh, Dad. "
"Martin: Oh, don't worry, I won't get in the way. I'll just go grab a beer "
"Frasier: Oh, no trouble at all, Dad. "
"Frasier: Dad, you and Sherry... "
"Martin: Oh jeez, I don't believe this Frasier, it's over. She's gone, she's out of my life "
"Martin: What the hell's she doing here? "
"Frasier: She came in to borrow the powder room, I'll be right back. "
"Frasier: How's everything out here? "
"Sherry: Fine, how's everything in there? "
"Frasier: Fine, fine. I think I just need a few more minutes. "
"Leslie: Are you through with the powder room? "
"Sherry: Oh sure, it's all yours "
"Sherry: Frasier, take all the time you need. I'll entertain your friend. "
"Frasier: Oh, what and miss this fabulous sunset? "
"Sherry: Oh yeah, look at that I forgot how beautiful it is. "
"Frasier: So it is "
"Frasier: Here we go, to possi- oh, what am I doing? "
"Frasier: Two minutes, no more "
"Frasier: Oh, not you, Leslie. "
"Martin: Look, I don't know what you're doing. But you go right back out there and get rid of her. "
"Frasier: Dad, I am not trying to torture you. "
"Martin: Well, then you're doing a bad job. "
"Frasier: Alright, listen, I'm still a bit confused about something, maybe you can help me understand it. You said that you don't have any feelings for this woman. Alright then, fine. Why is it for the last three months you've been happier than since my mom died? "
"Martin: Hey, you just leave your mother out of this "
"Frasier: I didn't mean to bring her into this. That's not what I'm talking about... Dad, is that what this about? Mom? "
"Martin: No Alright? "
"Frasier: Listen, I'm a psychiatrist. "
"Martin: Well, I don't need a psychiatrist and I don't need your help "
"Frasier: Dad, that is just classic defensive... "
"Frasier: Excuse me, butterfingers "
"Frasier: Now listen, Dad, I do not mean to upset you. I believe that the feelings that you're going through here are feelings of guilt. It's probably natural to feel that way - my God, I understand exactly what you're going through. "
"Martin: No, you don't, no you don't. You don't understand at "
"all: when you've been married for thirty-five years, you never thought there could be someone else, and one day you hear yourself say, 'I love you' to another woman, maybe then you'll understand what I'm going through. "
"Frasier: Dad, there was a time after my first marriage was breaking up, I was talking to Mom. She said to me, 'Frasier, you've got to promise me you're not going to give up.' I said, 'Mom, please, the last thing I want to hear is a bunch of clichés, and that we're all put on the earth to love each other, and how it's certainly possible for the human heart to love more than one person.' I said, 'Alright, Mom, give me one good reason to ever let myself fall in love again.' She said, 'Because I said so and I'm your mother' "
"Martin: Yeah, but it sure doesn't help reminding me what a great lady she was. "
"Frasier: Well, does it help to remind you that Sherry's a pretty great lady too? God, dad, she makes you happy. Niles and I would give anything to have what you have. Well, not WHAT you have but what you HAVE. "
"Martin: Yeah, she's a pretty great lady, isn't she? I don't know, she'd probably be better off with some guy who isn't going through all this. "
"Frasier: Well, don't you think you should let her decide that? "
"Martin: Hiya. "
"Sherry: Hi. "
"Frasier: Well, it looks like those two could use a little privacy. You mind if I take you to the restaurant a little early? "
"Leslie: I think that's a good idea. "
"Frasier: We can finish off the wine later... not that we're coming back here... not that I'm obverse to that, of course... I mean, if you're in the mood for a night count.... a nightcap "
"Leslie: Well, it looks like your dad and his girlfriend are patching things up. "
"Frasier: Yes. Gee, I can't thank you enough for being tolerant about the time delay. "
"Leslie: "
"Frasier: You'd be surprised, lately women just fly into rages of intolerance under the slightest provocation.... "
"Sherry: Wait, Leslie. Before you go, I just want to say something. "
"Frasier: Oh, good Lord, step lively "
"Sherry: Listen, you are a lucky girl to be with someone as sweet as Frasier. He just did a real nice thing for his dad and me. "
"Frasier: Thank you, Sherry. Off we go "
"Martin: We'll ride down with you, we're going down the street to get a little Chinese. "
"Leslie: Why don't we give you a lift? "
"Frasier: No I mean, don't you think the walk would do them good? "
"Leslie: But I think it's starting to rain Come on, ride with us. "
"Sherry: Oh, you're such a doll. "
"door: "
"Sherry: Leslie, what do you do? "
"Leslie: Oh, I'm a dermatologist. "
"Sherry: Good news, Frasier If you get lucky tonight she might just look at that rash of yours "
"Frasier: Yes... "
"Sherry: Oh, that reminds me of a great joke.... "
"Frasier: Hold the elevator, will you? Eddie "
"Frasier: Well, you could at least act surprised "

"Sherry: Morning, sunshine "
"Frasier: Morning, Sherry. "
"Sherry: Coffee's on, want a cuppa? "
"Frasier: No thank you, caffeine only weakens the immune system. I'm fighting off a flu. "
"Sherry: Oh, I'm sorry. Let me get you some breakfast. "
"Frasier: No, no that's really not necessary. "
"Sherry: Oh, no, no, you'll feel much better once you've had my scrambled egg tacos and Spam patties. "
"Frasier: Yes, in keeping with the trusty adage, 'starve a cold, disgust a fever.' "
"Daphne: Tea and dry toast? "
"Frasier: Oh, bless you. "
"Sherry: Oh honey, I was using that "
"Daphne: Oh, sorry. "
"Sherry: No problem. Listen, why don't you just relax? I'll clean up later. "
"Daphne: You know, not to criticise, but I usually serve Mr. Crane whole grain cereal for breakfast. I try to avoid giving him fried foods. "
"Sherry: Oh, Marty loves fried foods. "
"Daphne: Yes well, just because he likes something doesn't mean it's good for him. "
"Sherry: True, but just because something's good for him doesn't mean that he has to be stuck with it day after day. "
"Martin: It looks like it's going to be another scorcher. "
"Frasier: Hmm. "
"Martin: Radio said high nineties. "
"Frasier: Yes, hot. "
"Martin: Yeah, well, I guess they'll be some more brown-outs. I hate to think what it'll do to the crops. "
"Frasier: Dad please, I'm trying to read. "
"Martin: Oh, sure, sorry. Oh, another double homicide last night. You know, with this heat wave going I'm not surprised. I wonder what started that? "
"Frasier: Perhaps someone wouldn't stop talking about the weather. "
"Martin: What? Yeah, you might be right, it's a real scorcher out there. "
"Sherry: Morning, handsome Did I say that before? "
"Martin: Before, and after "
"Frasier: Please, would you two spare me the single entendre this morning? I'm trying to avoid getting sick. "
"Sherry: Well there's nothing like one of momma's big biscuits if you're fighting something off. "
"Frasier: Yes, I'm sure with good aim it could bring down an elk "
"Sherry: What about you, sweetie? "
"Daphne: Oh, just half of one for me. "
"Sherry: Oh come on, wouldn't hurt you to put on a few pounds. Men like to see a little oomph in your walk-away. "
"Martin: Yeah, you ought to see them smile when Sherry leaves the room "
"Daphne: I can imagine. "
"Sherry: Oh, now, you're so pretty. I don't understand why men aren't just buzzing around you. Frasier, you're not seeing anybody. Here you are under the same roof, both cute as corn Why don't you two... "
"Frasier: Just stop right there. I'm trying to have a peaceful morning and I do not want to be put on the spot, I do not want to eat some bizarre breakfast concoction, and I do not want to discuss the weather. I just want to try and conserve energy, sit here, and enjoy my paper. "
"Martin: Sure, Fras. "
"Roz: I'm gonna break every bone in your bent little body "
"Bulldog: Hey, if you weren't a girl and I didn't kinda like this, I'd be pounding ya "
"Frasier: Bup-bup-bup Not another word "
"Roz: But he... "
"Frasier: Bup I don't care who did what to whom or in what disgusting manner. As we speak, hordes of viral Visigoths are hurling themselves over the battlements of my immune system, laying waste to my... Oh, dear God, you see how weak I am? I can't even finish a simple Visigoth metaphor. "
"Bulldog: Well, if you get sick don't go sneezing on everything. The last time the Happy Chef got a cold I was peeling lettuce off the mike for a week. "
"Roz: You will not believe what he... "
"Frasier: Hey Roz, I meant what I said I simply cannot deal with other people's problems today. "
"Roz: Well, good news for Mark on line three, whose wife is keeping a pumpkin in a bassinet Hey, I know what'll make you feel better. My friend Lisa's having a singles party tonight. I'm supposed to bring someone who I'm not interested in but who's a really good catch. "
"Frasier: Oh... Roz, please, I need my rest. You know, even if I didn't, I do not want to be poked and prodded by a bunch of desperate, alcohol-lubricated husband-hunters. "
"Roz: Oh, come on, it'll be fun Cheryl from Sales was asking if you'd be there. "
"Frasier: Cheryl - isn't she the one who, at the last company wedding, hip-checked you into the ice sculpture in her headlong rush to catch the bouquet? "
"Roz: That is not what happened She thought the bartender said 'last call.' "
"Bulldog: Look Roz, I'm not going to fight you anymore. But I want you to know you said a lot of things that really hurt my feelings. Fun is fun, but I'm not made of stone. So I want you to know as of this moment, we work together but we are no longer friends "
"Roz: Do you want to go to a party tonight? "
"Bulldog: I'm there "
"TO: "
"Daphne: Ready to do your exercises? "
"Martin: No, in a minute. "
"Sherry: Just a couple more hands. "
"Daphne: You said that half an hour ago "
"Sherry: Guess I must be a bad influence. "
"Martin: Yeah, next thing you know you're going to have me smoking behind the gym "
"Daphne: I'm sorry, but it's for your own good. I want you down on your back in two minutes and no arguments. "
"Martin: "
"Daphne: Hello? Speaking. Oh, she did, did she? Well, Sherry was mistaken, I don't go out with people I've never met. Thank you anyway. I can't believe it You gave my number to a total stranger? "
"Sherry: I thought it would be a nice surprise, you're not seeing anybody. Kenny is a great guy "
"Daphne: He said his name was Jack. "
"Sherry: Oh, I forgot about Jack. "
"Daphne: There's more than one? "
"Sherry: Well, I hope you're a lot nicer to Kenny when he calls. He has a boat "
"Daphne: Why don't you just squeeze me into a pair of hot-pants and drop me off down by the docks? "
"Sherry: Maybe you wouldn't be so touchy if you didn't wake up on the wrong side of no one every morning. "
"Daphne: That's your answer to everything, sex It's like you're part rabbit People ought to rub your feet for luck "
"Martin: Come on now, you don't want to say something you're going to regret Now you're acting like a couple of fishwives [they both stare at him, offended] See, I'm regretting that one already. "
"Daphne: Maybe I'd be less touchy if I didn't spend half my time cleaning up after you, and the other half on the phone to the garbage disposal repair man because one of your bloody big biscuits broke the blade "
"Sherry: There's a lot of 'B' words for a little girl. Here's one you forgot... "
"Daphne: B-/Oh, don't you dare "
"Sherry: What do you mean don't I dare "
"Frasier: Is Seattle experiencing a Prozac shortage? "
"Martin: Oh, Daphne and Sherry have a little problem. Actually, maybe you can settle it. "
"Frasier: Sorry Dad, it was all I could do to get through my show. King Solomon has split his last baby for the day, my health is hanging by a thread. Bup-bup-bup You're just going to have to settle this amongst yourselves, quietly "
"Daphne: You've got a lot of nerve talking to me that way "
"Sherry: Me? You're the one who started it, didn't she, Marty? "
"Martin: Hey, you're not putting me in the middle of this. "
"Daphne: I didn't start anything. You've had your big conk in my business all day "
"Sherry: That better mean 'nose' "
"Daphne: And what if it doesn't? "
"Martin: Hey Come on, knock it off. Now, I said I wouldn't get involved in this, but... Daphne, you know, Sherry was only trying to be nice. "
"Daphne: Of course you'd take her side, she's the one who keeps your hammer toes warm at night. "
"Martin: What the hell's that supposed to mean? "
"Daphne: Oh, figure it out "
"Martin: Oh, come on, Daph... "
"TO: "
"Niles: Ow, ow Baby, go to your perch, go to your perch. "
"Niles: Daphne? "
"Daphne: I'm so sorry to bother you, Dr. Crane, but I had an awful row with Sherry and I can't go back there. I tried a couple of my girlfriends, but they weren't home. So... may I spend the night here? "
"TO: a few moments later. "
"Daphne: Relax, Dr. Crane, I'm just unbuttoning your shirt. "
"Time: 11"
":27) "
"Daphne: Are you feeling any better? "
"Niles: Yes. I don't know what happened, my knees never buckled like that before. The wine and the heat must have made me dizzy. "
"Daphne: Yes, it is rather steamy in here. "
"Niles: I apologise for the lack of air conditioning. It seems in order to live in an exclusive landmark building, one must have to sweat through the odd heat wave like a tortured character in a [trails off as Daphne lifts her shirt up over the fan] Tennessee... Williams... play. "
"Daphne: I can't imagine what you must be thinking. Me barging in, asking to stay the night... [bends over and lets the air blow down the front of her shirt] "
"Niles: Well, gee I'm just thinking so many things. [takes a long sip of his wine] "
"Daphne: Sherry just makes me so mad. [turns around and lets it blow up her back] She's been giving my number to strange men so they'd call and ask me out. "
"Niles: How dare she Why would she do such a thing? "
"Daphne: Because she says I'm too rigid. "
"Niles: Nonsense "
"Daphne: And that I'm too picky. "
"Niles: Poppycock "
"Daphne: And that I'd be much happier if I just went out and had sex with someone. "
"Niles: Just to play Devil's advocate... "
"Daphne: Don't tell me you agree with her "
"Niles: No, no. It's much too hot for hell to have frozen over. "
"Daphne: I mean, it's like caveman thinking 'All Daphne needs is a quick roll in the hay' "
"Niles: Yes, well... "
"Daphne: 'A little slap and tickle would solve all her problems' "
"Niles: Yeah, um... "
"Daphne: The worse part is... I think she might be right. Maybe part of why I got so mad at her is because she hit a nerve. "
"Niles: It's very possible. "
"Daphne: I mean, I have been keeping myself on the shelf lately. I'm feeling a little like the good China. "
"Niles: Someone should be eating off you everyday. "
"Niles: Hmm... music? "
"Daphne: Lovely. "
"Daphne: You know, I hope this doesn't sound terribly forward, but I'm so hot. I'd really love to get out of these sweaty clothes. "
"Daphne: Would it be all right if I took a cool bath? "
"Niles: Yes, of course. It's upstairs, third door on your left. "
"Daphne: Thank you. "
"Niles: There are fresh towels in the linen closet - use the Indian cotton, it will be more gentle on your skin. "
"Daphne: Oh, Dr. Crane, you're always thinking of me. "
"Niles: You have no idea "
"TO: "
"room: Passion fruit has been laid "
"Daphne: Dr. Crane? Ooh, that fan feels good. "
"Niles: Oh, sorry "
"Daphne: That's quite all right. Thanks for lending me your dressing gown. Don't you just love the feel of silk on your skin? "
"Niles: Yes, there's nothing quite like it. Passion fruit? "
"Daphne: Thank you You know, if you keep treating me like this I'll never want to leave. "
"Niles: Champagne? "
"Daphne: Oh, you shouldn't have "
"Niles: I love champagne, but it's a drink for two and I never have anyone to share it with. "
"Daphne: Yes, there are things you miss when you're on your "
"own: champagne, another person's touch - even if it's just holding hands. I guess you've been missing that sort of thing too since you and Mrs. Crane split up. "
"Niles: Well actually, Maris never held hands. She had a slight webbing which made her self-conscious. "
"Daphne: Well, I'm sure there are other intimacies you miss. "
"Niles: Well, actually I still have a longing for... I still have a desire for, um, to have... "
"Niles: Sex?/ Fruit? "
"Niles: I mean, yeah, sex. "
"Daphne: I'd love some. "
"Daphne: I mean fruit Although sex is good too "
"Daphne: I'm sorry, Dr. Crane, I guess I just have sex on the mind tonight "
"Niles: Well, that happens. "
"Daphne: And this weather doesn't help, does it? The heat gets inside you... it makes you so aware of your body. It's like nature's way of letting you know you're still an animal. "
"Niles: God, it's hot in here. "
"Daphne: It seems to be getting hotter every minute. "
"Niles: Ice? "
"Daphne: Oh yes, I could use some right now. "
"Daphne: Ohhh... Oh yes, that's better... "
"Daphne: Where's your piece? "
"Niles: It melted. I'll get another. "
"Daphne: You know, unless it cools down, I'm afraid we won't be getting much sleep tonight. "
"Niles: Shame we have just the one fan. "
"Daphne: Oh, really? Yes, that is a shame. The two of us and just one fan... "
"Daphne: Well of course, you're the host, you take it. "
"Niles: No, no, I couldn't sleep at all knowing you were in the next room all hot and... hot. "
"Daphne: Well... I suppose, under the circumstances... we could both sleep in the same room. "
"Niles: It does... oscillate. "
"Daphne: What? "
"Niles: The fan. "
"Daphne: Oh... "
"Daphne: Oh, dear. "
"Niles: What? "
"Daphne: It's time to take my pills. I forgot all about them, they're back at the apartment. "
"Niles: What pills? "
"Daphne: It's my thyroid. Nothing serious, it's just a bit overactive. If I don't take my pills I tend to faint dead away. "
"Niles: What's the point in a fainting couch if you can't use it once in a while? "
"Daphne: I'll just run over and get them. I'll come right back. "
"Niles: No We'll go together and I'll run up for you. If you and Sherry get into the same room together the two of you might make up... ...more reasons to fight with one another. "
"TO: "
"Sherry: Nilesy Where did you come from? "
"Martin: What are you doing here? "
"Niles: Daphne's taken refuge at my apartment for the night. I just stopped by to get a few of her things. "
"Martin: Back You weren't going to tell us, you were going to let us worry all night? "
"Niles: No, I was going to tell you on my way out. "
"Martin: Oh this is stupid, I'm going to call her and get her back here and we're going to work this whole thing out. "
"Niles: Dad, it's a waste of time, she's so upset there is no way she'll ever set foot in this apartment tonight "
"Niles: If you don't believe me, you can ask her yourselves. "
"Daphne: I just remembered, my pills aren't in the medicine cabinet, they're on my dresser. "
"Niles: What courage, pulling yourself together like this, just scurry on down to the car, and I'll only be a moment. [Martin holds him back] "
"Martin: Er Daphne, Sherry and I talked about this, and we really feel bad about this. You know, the whole thing is just a misunderstanding. "
"Sherry: If you want, I suppose we could sit down and talk it out. "
"Daphne: Well, I suppose we could. "
"Niles: Obviously these two wildcats can't come to terms. The best thing will be for them to be apart. I know, I'm a psychiatrist. "
"Sherry: No, your dad is right. Now Daphne just misunderstood. "
"Daphne: I didn't exactly misunderstand. You did set me up with a total stranger "
"Sherry: Oh, but he's not a stranger, he comes in the bar all the time. "
"Daphne: Oh, a barfly Much better. "
"Sherry: Oh, there you go again "
"Daphne: Me "
"Martin: You know, you two are really a lot alike. "
"Both: How dare you/I'm nothing like her. "
"Niles: Talk amongst yourselves "
"Martin: Frasier? "
"Frasier: I'm taking a bath. "
"Martin: Bubbles? "
"Frasier: They're aromatherapeutic. And exactly what part of 'I'm taking a bath' did you take to mean 'come on in'? "
"Martin: Well, I'm sorry to tax your delicate system, but Daphne is back, and she and Sherry are at it again, and I don't know what to do and this is your department "
"Frasier: Yes, all right, unless blood has been spilled, and on a carpeted area, I don't care. Now get out "
"Sherry: There you are Marty, I tried, but that girl has no manners whatsoever. Hey, Frasier. "
"Frasier: Do you mind "
"Daphne: Whatever they're telling you about me, it's not true. "
"Frasier: Daphne, please, you can't come in here. "
"Daphne: Why not? She can "
"Frasier: No, she can't, no-one can "
"Niles: Frasier, have you no decency? Daphne, let's go "
"Frasier: All right I am moments away from succumbing once and for all to this flu. I am going to take one stab at this and then I am going to sink, Hippopotamus-like, beneath the bubbles. I think what this all comes down to is a dispute over turf. Daphne and Sherry are like two animals scent-marking their territory, which in this case is you, Dad. "
"Martin: You couldn't come out with a less disgusting comparison? "
"Frasier: All right, all right, fine, it's like the Roman emperor Tiberius, his mother Livia, and his wife Vipsania. "
"Martin: What? "
"Sherry: Huh? "
"Daphne: Who? "
"Niles: Go on. "
"Frasier: Fine "
"Daphne: your primary role in this household is to take care of Dad. "
"Sherry: you also enjoy taking care of Dad. I suspect that your attempts to find Daphne a boyfriend are really an unconscious ploy to get her out of the way. It's unconscious. "
"Frasier: Daphne, naturally you are threatened by this and you feel you are no longer needed. "
"Daphne: Yes, I have been feeling a bit unwanted lately. "
"Niles: Well, a night without your services will have them singing a different tune, let's go. "
"Frasier: Nobody's going to be singing anything tonight Daphne, I think we now all understand why you stormed out of here earlier. A strong emotion like not feeling wanted can drive anyone into a rash and impulsive act. "
"Daphne: Yes, it nearly did... I mean, yes it did. "
"Frasier: Well, at the root of this, you're both just feeling insecure. "
"Martin: Exactly "
"Frasier: Though it could probably have been avoided if Dad had been sensitive enough to remind you that you are both important in his life. "
"Martin: What are you saying? That it's my fault? "
"Daphne: Well I must admit, a few reassuring words might just have done the trick. "
"Sherry: Marty does have difficulty expressing his feelings. "
"Martin: No, I don't "
"Daphne: Oh, Sherry... "
"Sherry: Oh, save it honey, it wasn't our fault. "
"Martin: Yes, it was You said that she was skinny and you said that she was big-mouthed. "
"Frasier: Now, that is not important. We all feel better now. "
"Martin: Well, I don't "
"Frasier: Oh look, I am running out of patience, I am running out of strength, and I am running out of bubbles Please, the lecture has ended "
"Daphne: You're a good psychiatrist, Dr. Crane. "
"Sherry: You sure are, hon'. You see, Marty, it isn't just a lot of hooey "
"Niles: Thank you very much "
"Frasier: Oh please, Niles. Look, unconsciously you knew it wasn't right. That's why you brought Daphne back here. "
"Niles: No, we came back to fetch her damn thyroid pills. "
"Frasier: You're a doctor. Why didn't you just use your prescription pad? "
"Niles: Oh my God... "
"Frasier: Isn't there an all-night pharmacy across the street from your building? "
"Niles: Oh my God "

"Frasier: Well, that's our show for today. But before we close I'd like to invite you all to join us here at KACL in wishing a fond farewell to our Happy Chef, Leo Pasquale, as he bubble-wraps his crepe pan and heads south towards sunny Santa Fe. Leo, you stirred us with your passion; melted us with your charm; added spice to our lives. Now as you whisk yourself away let's not say goodbye, but rather “tartar” for now. This is Dr. Frasier Crane, KACL 780. "
"Roz: Well, at least you stopped short of saying, 'I'll be fricasseeing you.' You ready to go to Leo's party? "
"Frasier: Oh, dear God, there is nothing I detest more than a KACL goodbye party. They're all the same – twist-top wine with a bunch of people standing round awkwardly trying to summon up some affection for someone they hardly even know. It always ends up reeking of insincerity. "
"Bulldog: What are we gonna do, Doc? He's leaving us. "
"Roz: Bulldog and Leo were tight. "
"Frasier: Well, Bulldog certainly is. "
"Bulldog: I love that guy, man. He'd give me all his leftovers. "
"Roz: I warned "
"Leo: you keep feeding him, he'll keep coming back. "
"Bulldog: You going to his party? "
"Frasier: Well, actually I think I'm going to pass. "
"Bulldog: Oh come on Doc, you gotta at least have a drink, give him a hug. "
"Frasier: That is precisely what I'm trying to avoid. Since when did we become a society of huggers? We hug for everything nowadays. 'Hello' - hug; 'Congratulations' - hug; 'Nice haircut' - hug. It's absurd. I mean, if we want to express real emotion for someone - I mean, where is there left to go? "
"Bulldog: I've had good luck with the storage closet. "
"Roz: You know, I think you're way too uptight about this. "
"Bulldog: No, no. I see the Doc's point. We all have different ways of saying goodbye. Me? I prefer this "
"method: Get out I got a show to do "
"Roz: Well, I think hugging is very healthy. I read somewhere that if you have physical contact on a regular basis, it can actually extend your life. "
"Frasier: Well, in that case you should outlive Styrofoam "
"Leo: Frasier, you made it "
"Frasier: You know I wouldn't miss saying goodbye to you for the world. "
"Roz: Oh Leo, we're going to miss you so much "
"Tom: We sure are. Oh, what the heck. "
"Frasier: You have no idea how hard this is for me. "
"Frasier: I must say, Niles, that is a striking tie you're wearing. "
"Niles: Thank you. It was a gift from Maris. She had it made for me to commemorate the end of that dreadful winter she had her obesity scare. "
"Frasier: Oh yes. I remember her struggle to lose that holiday pound. "
"Niles: After she'd restored her figure she had Yoshi set fire to a hippopotamus topiary she felt had taunted her. Then, as a visual reminder never to let herself go again, she had this tie made for me out of the legs of her fat pants. [the waiter brings his coffee] Thank you. "
"Frasier: You know, I would think wearing a tie that Maris gave you might make you feel a little bit melancholy. "
"Niles: On the contrary. I have every reason to believe Maris and I may be on the road to reconciliation. "
"Frasier: Really? "
"Niles: We met for lunch today. I told her I couldn't stand to be in separation limbo anymore, and unless she wanted the marriage to end we simply had to get into counseling. "
"Frasier: And she agreed? "
"Niles: Her exact words were, 'I'll think about it.' But I saw a twinkle in her eye I have not seen since the neighbor children discovered our new electric fence. "
"Frasier: Congratulations. "
"Niles: Thank you. The foam is a tad listless today. "
"Frasier: Yes. I can tell without looking that they've got Chad back on steamer duty. "
"Niles: You are good. "
"Messenger: Excuse me. Dr. Niles Crane? "
"Niles: I am. "
"Messenger: Here. "
"Niles: Who's sending me this? [reads the letter] '"
"Notice: Petition... For Divorce.' "
"Messenger: Sorry, man. Cool tie. "
"Frasier: I don't know what to say. "
"Niles: Oh... it's all right. Would have been nice if we'd given therapy a try, but, uh... so be it. "
"Frasier: I know this is little consolation, but you're to be applauded for the way you're handling this. A lesser man would panic. "
"Niles: Oh, oh, wait, wait, wait I'll get her back. "
"Frasier: You have too much dignity to let yourself beg "
"Niles: Please give me my phone back. "
"Frasier: No. "
"Niles: Please. "
"Frasier: Sorry. "
"Niles: Please "
"Frasier: Stop it. "
"Frasier: Now listen. I know you're upset, but let's remember why you left Maris in the first "
"place: you were tired of groveling. "
"Niles: Yes, but I'm rested now. "
"Frasier: Fine Go ahead and toddle on back to Maris. Let her grind you under her boot heel for another twelve years, rob you of whatever self-respect you've still retained, then we can have this conversation all over again "
"Niles: I was unhappy, wasn't I? "
"Frasier: You were miserable. "
"Niles: I'm sorry. It's just a lot to take in. Twelve years of my life - gone. "
"Frasier: Don't think of it as a loss, but rather an opportunity for growth. It's not an ending, it's... "
"Niles: Frasier - no offense, but I'm familiar with all the platitudes. I've just been served divorce papers. I need a little time to let it sink in. If you don't mind, maybe we could not talk about it for a while. "
"Frasier: Of course. "
"Waitress: Hi, can I get you guys anything? "
"Frasier: No, thank you. We've already been served. "
"Frasier: Sorry. "
"TO: "
"Daphne: Ooh, you're back. "
"Martin: Yeah, I never should have left. The park was a disaster. You remember that outfit Mrs. Foster knitted Eddie for Christmas? Well, I bumped into her in the lobby and she said that she was going to be going to the park and I thought, well it would be rude if I didn't at least have him wear it one time, you know? Eddie, get in here. "
"Martin: Look at the poor guy, he's humiliated. And then of course she didn't even show up there but you know who was there? Duke and two guys from the old precinct. 'Oh Marty – glad to see you've got something to do now you're retired'; 'Hey Marty – if I buy you some wool will you knit something for me?' "
"Daphne: Well, it could have been worse. You could have been wearing the hat she made for you. "
"Daphne: Oh, dear. "
"Martin: Would you take that off him? He just looks so pathetic. "
"Daphne: Oh, come here you poor little fella. "
"Martin: What's in the box? "
"Daphne: Oh, nothing. Just some old stuff I was taking down to the storage bin. "
"Martin: Oh, great. Why don't you take this with it? [holding out his bunnet] "
"Daphne: Yeah, just set that on top. "
"Martin: No, no. It'll fall off if I do. Hey, this is my stuff "
"Daphne: It's a box of junk. "
"Martin: It's not junk. "
"Daphne: Oh, rubbish. It's a bunch of useless gadgets you haven't used in years. Like this remote control to God knows what – useless. Just like this, [pulls out some unidentifiable object] whatever it is. "
"Martin: That's the SteamMaster 2000 Like on TV, 'Live life wrinkle free' It even comes with an attachment that cooks Chinese vegetables. "
"Frasier: That would be Niles. I'm taking him to lunch to get his mind off his troubles. "
"Daphne: Is that something we shouldn't talk about? "
"Martin: No, there's no reason why we shouldn't talk about it. "
"Frasier: Dad, I'm sorry, I don't think he's ready to talk about it so we're not talking about it. "
"Niles: Would you mind not talking about it a little less loudly? "
"Frasier: Niles. "
"Daphne: Hello, Dr. Crane. "
"Martin: Hi, Niles. "
"Niles: Afternoon, all. I appreciate your concern but I'm really doing quite well with all this. Everything is going to be fine. "
"Martin: Ah, well that's good. I just hope you've got a good divorce lawyer, because you've been married a long time, and you gotta make sure you get your fair share. "
"Niles: Well, according to the terms of our prenuptial agreement, I believe I'm wearing my fair share. "
"Martin: Well, take a tip from your old man. You get over there and take possession of your personal belongings before they box them up and toss them out "
"Daphne: When will you just admit that this junk belongs in a dustbin? "
"Martin: You know, I was on a case once where the wife constantly nagged the husband like this. 'You never put anything in the garbage. Why don't you ever put anything in the garbage?' "
"Daphne: Well, he should have listened to her. "
"Martin: Oh, he did. And that's where we found her "
"Frasier: You know, I think Daphne's fighting an uphill battle with this little project of hers. "
"Niles: What's that? "
"Frasier: It's a journal. "
"Niles: Isn't that mother's handwriting? "
"Frasier: These must be notes from one of her research projects. 'It's hard to imagine two male siblings who could be more different than Frasier and Niles.' "
"Niles: Good heavens. It's about us. "
"Frasier: 'Though both are highly intelligent, Frasier is clearly the more dominant of the two while Niles remains extremely passive.' Fascinating "
"Niles: 'Frasier never seems to get enough at mealtime. He's nearly twice the size of Niles and often, when he thinks I'm not looking, steals his brother's food.' "
"Frasier: 'What Niles lacks in assertiveness he makes up for in an abnormally fussy grooming regimen.' "
"Niles: 'Frasier is exhibiting clearly anti-social tendencies. In fact, he is extremely uncomfortable with touch, seeming to recoil from all human contact.' "
"Frasier: Where does it say that? "
"Niles: All right, I added 'extremely,' but it's right there. "
"Frasier: Good Lord. This cuts rather close to the bone. Just yesterday Roz was accusing me of the same thing. I always thought it was just an aversion to social hugging but apparently it goes deeper than that. You know, maybe this is something I should work on. What do you think? "
"Frasier: Niles? "
"Niles: 'April 3rd. Niles remains as docile as ever. He constantly allows himself to be cowed and dominated, especially by females.' "
"Frasier: Well, you shouldn't let that upset you. You've broken that pattern. You could have knocked that under and gone groveling back to Maris but you didn't. You know Niles, I don't think I've ever been more proud of you. "
"Niles: Oh Frasier, this is awful. "
"Frasier: Well, pardon me for trying. I am new at it. "
"Niles: No, no, no. You don't understand. I did go groveling back. "
"Frasier: What? "
"Niles: I sent the divorce papers back unsigned, along with a letter begging her to take me back. "
"Frasier: Niles, you didn't. "
"Niles: Of course I did. You read the journal. It's who I am. "
"Frasier: Well, how did she respond? "
"Niles: Well, she hasn't yet. I just messengered it to her this morning. It's her spa day. She won't be home until... I still have time to get that letter back. "
"Frasier: I'm going with you. "
"Niles: You're a good brother. This may be my last chance to prove once and for all that I'm not the sort of man who... who... whatever mother said. "
"Frasier: 'Constantly allows himself to be cowed and dominated, especially by females.' "
"Niles: I might have known you'd memorize it. "
"Frasier: You're right. That was harsh. Come here [Frasier holds out his arms for a hug] "
"Niles: Oh, get away from me. "
"Frasier: Niles, I'm still a little uneasy about this. What if one of the servants sees us? "
"Niles: Impossible. They always use Maris's spa day to play hooky. I just hope she hasn't changed the locks. "
"Niles: What do you know? You know, this is sort of exciting. Even as a child I always fancied I might make a first-rate society cat burglar. I think I'm right. "
"Frasier: Yes All it takes is stealth, cunning and a key to the door "
"Niles: The letter should be over here with the rest of Maris's unopened mail. Yes – here it is. Let's go. "
"Niles: Frasier, look, it's my puppies Oh, I've missed you. Hello, Gestalt Hello, Gerhardt "
"Frasier: Niles, don't they look just a bit agitated to you? "
"Niles: Well, that's because they're excited to see that the Lord has returned to the manor. Hello, boys "
"Niles: Oh my God. She hasn't changed the locks. She changed the dogs Quick, maybe we can make it to the front door. "
"Frasier: Right "
"Frasier: They're toying with us "
"Niles: What are we going to do? "
"Frasier: Well I guess we're just going to have to wait until Lady Baskerville comes back from the spa "
"Niles: And explain our presence how? "
"Frasier: Oh. I do see your point. "
"Niles: We have to find some way to distract those beasts and make our escape. Wait. Tuesday is Swedish meatball night for the staff. Cook always keeps them in the refrigerator. "
"Frasier: No, Niles. We can't feed them raw meat, it'll only stimulate their bloodlust. "
"Niles: Just "
"listen: one of our old dogs used to be spooked by thunderstorms. The vet told us half of one of Maris's green pills would allow him to sleep safely right through the storm. You get the meat, I'll get the pills. "
"Frasier: Right "
"Frasier: Wait What if Maris is out of pills? "
"Frasier: Oh, I see. "
"Niles: Thank you, Frasier, I needed that. "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Niles, that's three meatballs in a row right in the koi pond Stop trying to throw Just drop them, you can drop straight, can't you? "
"Niles: Was that a splat or a splash? "
"Frasier: A splat Do it again. Excellent They're eating it All right that's enough. [speaking to the dogs] Good boys. Yes, that's right, eat hearty. Oh, you missed one right over there in the garden by the tulips. Oh, there's a few more over there in the koi pond next to the... sleeping koi. "
"Frasier: Niles? Niles, this painting here in the living room – have you always had this? "
"Niles: The one of Maris and me in the garden? Yes, we had it commissioned on our third anniversary. "
"Frasier: No, no, it must be a different painting. This is Maris next to a really big tree. "
"Niles: No, there's no tree in that painting, it's... [notices the painting] Oh my God. She's had me completely painted out I don't think I can take much more of this. "
"Frasier: In that case, I wouldn't look too closely at the face of that skunk in the flowerbed. "
"Niles: Well, I suppose it's only fitting that I be commemorated in this household as a laughingstock. She's always run roughshod over me. Look around. This entire room is a monument to my spinelessness "
"Frasier: How so? "
"Niles: This Dresden Shepherdess? A peace offering I made to Maris when I was foolish enough to point out an extra syllable in a Haiku she'd written. [motions around the room] Choose another item. Anything. "
"Frasier: Oh, that candelabra? "
"Niles: Louis Quatorze What better way to apologise for the time I attempted to grow a moustache? "
"Frasier: I think you owe us all a candelabra for that. [noticing outside] Niles, look. It seems to be working. The dogs are getting drowsy. "
"Niles: You know, if just once Maris had given in, in all those years, I might think there was hope for our marriage. But she never budged an inch Even on those rare occasions that I reported back to you that I had prevailed...? "
"Frasier: I knew. "
"Niles: I don't know why I thought I could convince her with that couples' therapy idea. Well... I'm not going to be her whipping boy anymore. "
"Frasier: What are you doing? "
"Niles: I'm signing the divorce papers. She wants to initiate proceedings. Let's proceed. "
"Frasier: Niles, you know I'll support any decision you make, but are you sure? "
"Niles: Absolutely. "
"Niles: That's done. "
"Frasier: Are you OK? "
"Niles: I will be. Looks like the dogs are asleep. Shall we go? "
"Frasier: Oh, I don't know. Maybe they're just playing possum with us. "
"Niles: Frankly, I don't care. After what I've just done you think I'm going to let a couple of dogs frighten me? This is the last time I'm leaving this house. I'm going to walk through that door with my head held high. "
"Frasier: Good for you. I'm going to run like hell out the front door. "
"Niles: Wait up "
"TO: "
"Martin: Now the beauty of the 'Hot & Foamy' is the ultra-quick heating action. You just plug it in and two minutes later, presto, guess what comes out? "
"Daphne: Well, the obvious answer would be shaving cream, so I'll go with - music? "
"Martin: You had a lot of sassy things to say about my clothes steamer too. But didn't those snow peas taste delicious? "
"Daphne: Where did you two slip off to? "
"Niles: Oh, I just had some papers to sign. "
"Frasier: Yes. Niles has decided to begin divorce proceedings. "
"Daphne: I'm sorry, Dr. Crane. "
"Niles: It's OK. I feel good about it. "
"Frasier: Now we thought it might be nice to have a family dinner this evening at Chez Shea, so we stopped by to invite the two of you to join us. "
"Daphne: Oh, that would be nice. I'll just go freshen up. [heads to her bedroom] "
"Martin: Yeah, sounds great. And Niles, I'm proud of you. I know this isn't easy, but in the long run I know you'll be happier. I'm damn sure I will be. "
"Niles: I can't believe it. It's really over. "
"Frasier: If you choose you never have to see Maris again. "
"Niles: Oh, please. Half the time I couldn't see her when she was standing right in front of me. "
"Niles: No, really, I can't breathe Frasier, I signed divorce papers What was I thinking? "
"Frasier: Oh God, you're not having second thoughts? "
"Niles: I don't know. When I was caught up in the adrenaline it all seemed fine, but now in the clear light of day... "
"Frasier: Now, now, Niles. It's only natural for you to feel a little bit shaky, but believe me, you made the right decision. "
"Niles: How do I know that? "
"Frasier: Let's just check what prompted us to it. "
"Here: 'Niles is incapable of asserting himself, especially in front of females' "
"Niles: Keep going – this is helping. "
"Frasier: 'As I write this he lies, staring out the window, licking himself' "
"Niles: What? "
"Frasier: 'He's become so subservient lately that when he's finished grooming himself he often begins licking Frasier.' "
"Niles: I have no memory of that "
"Frasier: 'April 14th. The day I've dreaded for "
"weeks: Frasier died this morning. I never would have guessed that my heart could ache so over the death of my beloved lab rat. My only consolation is the knowledge that I will soon give birth to my first child.' "
"Niles: Frasier... do you know what this means? "
"Frasier: Our mother named us after rodents. "
"Niles: No. It means I have ended my marriage to the woman I love based on the case history of a spineless rat Oh My God "
"Frasier: Niles... "
"Niles: Oh my God Maris has seen the papers. It's too late to take it back. "
"Frasier: Niles, your reasoning was still sound. "
"Niles: My reasoning? My reasoning was based on my mother's obsession WITH VERMIN "
"Martin: What the hell's going on here? "
"Frasier: Niles is just a bit distraught. "
"Niles: Distraught? MY LIFE IS OVER "
"Frasier: Niles, don't talk that way My God man, you've got to calm down. "
"Niles: All right. I-I'm going to splash some cold water on my face. "
"Martin: Is he going to be all right? I've never seen him like this. "
"Frasier: Of course he'll be all right, Dad. [banging on the bathroom door] Niles Just remember to keep breathing. And trust me – this is not the end. Your life is not over Niles NILES "
"Frasier: Oh my God "
"Daphne: Dr. Crane Are you all right? "
"Niles: I'm fine. Just a little hot. And foamy. "
"Martin: You know what must have happened? My Hot & Foamy must have exploded "
"Daphne: He was a detective, you know "

"Niles: Do you think Maris and I are meant to be together? "
"TO: "
"Martin: Oh, what's this? "
"Daphne: I got you a gift. "
"Martin: You did? What's the occasion? "
"Daphne: No reason. "
"Martin: You can't just give somebody something for no reason. "
"Daphne: Yes, I can. "
"Martin: No, you can't. "
"Daphne: Yes, I can "
"Martin: No, you can't "
"Daphne: You're starting to take the fun out of this. "
"Martin: But there's no reason for this. "
"Daphne: Does there have to be a reason? "
"Martin: Yeah "
"Daphne: Oh, would you just open it up? "
"Martin: Oh, Jeez "
"Daphne: I knitted it myself. "
"Martin: Oh, gee "
"Daphne: You know, I had a bit of trouble with the rogue collar. I'm surprised you didn't hear me cursing from my bedroom. "
"Martin: Boy, Daphne, this is really nice. I wish I had something to give you. "
"Daphne: Oh, we're back on that again "
"Martin: Yeah, all right, all right, but at least let me pay you for it. "
"Daphne: Pay me for it? It's a gift "
"Martin: Well, just a couple of bucks for the yarn. "
"Frasier: Dad, is Niles home? "
"Martin: No. "
"Frasier: For God's sake, I've been standing out front for twenty minutes, we're going to be late for our squash court Nice cardigan. "
"Martin: Daphne surprised me with it "
"Frasier: You don't seem very happy about it. "
"Martin: No, well, I'm not, I mean you just don't give somebody something for no reason, that's my rule. "
"Frasier: Dad Spontaneous gift-giving is one of life's great pleasures. Didn't you ever give Mom anything without a warning? "
"Martin: Yeah, you Where do you think I got the rule from? "
"Frasier: There you are Come on, Niles, let's shake a leg We're going to be late for our court time. "
"Niles: Okay, just a minute. Of course I do, Maris. Well, I miss you more. No, I do. No, I do. "
"Frasier: Niles "
"Niles: No, I don't. No, you have the prettier laugh. No, you do. No, you do. "
"Martin: I'm gonna go walk into the ocean "
"Niles: Oh no, I would love to meet you for lunch but you know what Dr. Deutsch said; no meetings outside our therapy sessions. Oh, now, Maris. Wait, hold on a second, another line. Hello? "
"Frasier: Get the hell off the phone "
"Niles: How rude "
"Frasier: Please, don't you realise it's also rude to be late for an appointment "
"Niles: Oh, you are telling me about being late... "
"Niles: How dare you hang up on me Honey, do you mind if we continue this conversation later? Oh, I'll be counting the minutes too. "
"Frasier: Well, I hope you're happy, we've now officially lost our court "
"Niles: Well, I'm sorry. I would hope that my attempt to salvage my marriage would be more important to you than a squash game "
"Frasier: Well, of course it is. I was just looking forward to playing. "
"Niles: I enjoy a morning game of squash more than anyone. "
"Frasier: No, I do. "
"Niles: No, I do. "
"Frasier: No, no... Niles, I would love to see you and Maris reconciling, if that's what you want. I'm just afraid you might be going a bit too quickly. Would you like some coffee? "
"Niles: Please. "
"Frasier: Need I remind you that only last month she served you divorce papers "
"Niles: I'm well aware of that, but we're not rushing into anything. We only see each other at therapy. That reminds me, yesterday at the café I asked you a question which you deftly avoided answering. Do you think Maris and I are meant to be together? "
"Frasier: Right, well, er, that's a tough question. You know, perhaps the better question would be, do you think you and Maris are meant to be together? "
"Niles: Hmmm, I served you up a question, you clumsily bat it back to me. We've hardly missed our squash game at all No, no, I'm really interested in your opinion. Let's say you were God. "
"Frasier: Niles, please, I don't want to play God "
"Niles: Oh, please... no, just play along. Let's say you are the supreme ruler of heaven and earth. What would you do? "
"Frasier: Well, for starters I'd issue a recall on some of my lesser species "
"Niles: I still want an answer to that question. Hello? What is it, pumpkin? Now, now, dear, calm down. I'm sure the banging you hear is just the pipes; if one of the servants had actually been walled in during the remodeling, he would have died weeks ago. Okay, if it will ease your mind at all, why don't you have Marta take role call? Hello? "
"Frasier: Get out "
"Frasier: Well, this is Dr. Frasier Crane saying goodbye and good mental health. "
"Roz: Your brother called. "
"Frasier: Oh, Lord, he must really want an answer to that question. "
"Roz: No, he just wanted to tell you the wine club meeting was cancelled. What question? "
"Frasier: Well, yesterday he asked me straight up if I thought he and Maris were meant for each other. "
"Roz: That's a loaded question. "
"Frasier: Yeah, you're telling me. In fact, I don't even know what my answer is. "
"Roz: Why don't you just play it safe and say yes? In my experience, when someone asks that question, they're not looking for honesty, they're looking for reassurance. Tell him what he wants to hear. "
"Frasier: I don't know, Roz. "
"Roz: Trust me, Frasier. It's like if I asked you, 'Do I look fat in these pants?' "
"Frasier: Yeah, you're right. I guess there's only one way to answer that question. "
"Roz: What? Do you think I look fat in these? "
"Frasier: No, I don't. "
"Roz: I work out every day... "
"Frasier: Roz "
"Roz: It's the pleats, isn't it? "
"Frasier: Stop it, get a hold of yourself I was thinking about what you had said. I'm going to tell Niles yes, I think he and Niles were meant to be together. "
"Roz: Who are you waving to? Is that Elise Edmunds from Promotions? "
"Frasier: We have a little date tonight. "
"Roz: A date? And you didn't tell me? "
"Frasier: Well, it's no big deal, I don't even think she's interested in me. "
"Elise: Hey, Frasier. Hey, Roz. Sorry to interrupt, I just wanted to make sure, am I still seeing you tonight? "
"Frasier: Yes, you are. But of course, I'll be seeing you as well. "
"Elise: Bye, Frasier. "
"Roz: Whoa-ho-ho That woman is totally into you "
"Frasier: You think so? "
"Roz: Yeah. See you later, bye. "
"Frasier: Is that a good sign? "
"Roz: Hello? She might as well cat-roped you with her pantyhose "
"Frasier: It probably should be a very interesting night. Though she is very attractive, slender... "
"Roz: Gee, I wonder why your mind went there? "
"Frasier: Oh, not this again "
"Roz: Of course it would. Standing next to me, I hate these pants "
"Frasier: Oh, please. "
"Roz: I look like the Liberty Bell "
"Frasier: The Liberty Bell has a crack in it "
"TO: "
"Daphne: Afternoon, Mr. Crane. "
"Martin: Hello. "
"Daphne: I've got the mail. "
"Martin: Oh, thanks, you want to just put it on that table there. "
"Daphne: Is this for me? "
"Martin: Well, do you know anybody else around here who uses Eucalyptus bubble bath? "
"Daphne: Well, your son occasionally likes... "
"Martin: Oh, never mind. "
"Daphne: ThiS is lovely. "
"Martin: Well, I'm glad you like it, because I picked it all out myself. You know, I got you your fancy soaps and your moisturisers and this rock thing that scrapes all the dead skin off the bottom of your feet. Well, if you're going to nap on the couch, wear slippers. "
"Daphne: Still, Mr. Crane, you really overdid it. "
"Martin: No, I didn't. "
"Daphne: I don't know if I can accept this. "
"Martin: Why not? "
"Daphne: Because you've spent far too much. "
"Martin: All right, well, I'll take a couple of things back. "
"Daphne: No, wait. "
"Martin: Daphne, will you please just take the damn basket? "
"Daphne: Well, what are you getting so cross about? "
"Martin: Well, what? You can give me a gift but I'm not allowed to give you one back? "
"Daphne: Oh, so that's the only reason you gave me this? "
"Martin: Yeah, that's the way it works. "
"Daphne: Well, where I come from you don't just give someone a gift because you have to. Here, take your silly basket. "
"Martin: All right, fine. Well then, you can take your crappy little cardigan back too. "
"Daphne: Fine "
"Martin: I don't know why you gave it to me in the first place. "
"Daphne: Because I like you. "
"Martin: Well, I like you. "
"Daphne: Then why can't you just accept my gift and be happy? "
"Martin: I am happy, I love that cardigan. "
"Daphne: And I love my damn basket. "
"Frasier: What is all this? "
"Daphne: Oh, we're just exchanging our damn gifts. "
"Martin: Here. "
"Daphne: Here. "
"Martin: Thanks "
"Daphne: Thank you "
"Frasier: Good Lord, it's like Christmas morning in the Gambino household "
"Martin: By the way, Niles called while you were in the shower to remind you about the squash tomorrow. "
"Frasier: That's strange. I just made that date this morning, he must be really champing at the bit to get an answer to that question. "
"Martin: What question? "
"Frasier: Oh, he asked me if I thought he and Maris were meant to be together. "
"Martin: Well, if you ask me, you should keep your bazoo shut You're always getting into trouble opening that big bazoo of yours "
"Frasier: Oh wonderful, dad, we've found a new word to strike from your vocabulary. Along with patootie and bupkis "
"Martin: You're going to answer him, aren't ya? "
"Frasier: Well, I think I have to. But listen, I'm just going to play it safe. Tell him yes. He's gonna do what he wants to anyway. "
"Martin: Hey, I don't know, he takes your opinion pretty damn seriously. "
"Frasier: Well, when we were younger, there was a certain sway I had over him. Oh God, do you remember that time back in prep school when he was going to try out for the track team and I convinced him all the really cool kids were going to join the Madrigal society. "
"Martin: I'm not just talking about school, I mean he's always come to you for career decisions, too - where to do his residency, where to set up his practice. "
"Frasier: Hmm, perhaps I have underestimated my influence. You know, frankly, my opinion could be the single most important factor in his making this decision. "
"Martin: Well, I don't know if I'd go as far as that. "
"Frasier: Oh, please, dad. You don't know what it's like to have your opinion matter Niles depends on me, he deserves my true and honest answer. "
"Martin: And what is that? "
"Frasier: Well, Maris has always been spoilt and selfish and led him around by the nose, I'd have to say my answer would be no. Thank you, dad. I've changed my answer from a yes to a no. "
"Martin: There you go. "
"Frasier: On the other hand... I knew it. You know, there are a lot of other factors here, dad. Niles does love Maris. "
"Frasier: She has agreed to go into therapy; Niles swears that she's a changed person. I don't know, I guess if I really want to know what's going on in Maris's mind, I've got to ask her myself. "
"Frasier: You agree with that, don't you dad? "
"Martin: Oh, yeah, sure. "
"Frasier: Well, I've got a couple of hours before my date. So what I'm going to do, if I really want to know was Maris is thinking, I will go directly to the source. "
"TO: "
"Waitress: Are you ready to order? "
"Frasier: Ah, well, not quite yet, I'm still waiting on someone. Oh, there she is now. "
"Frasier: Marta "
"Frasier: Marta, I can't tell you how nice it is to see you again. "
"Marta: My pleasure, and this coffee is too, too divine "
"Frasier: I see your English lessons with Maris are progressing, yes? "
"Marta: Yes, she teaching me many words. That coat is so declassé. "
"Frasier: Listen Marta, I'm going to come right to my point. Dr. Crane and Maris - Missy Crane - have both been seeing a couples' therapist lately and I understand it's going very well. "
"Marta: Therapy helping Missy Crane a lot. "
"Frasier: Really? So you would say that she is a changed person? "
"Marta: Si, si, Missy Crane very "
"different: nicer to everyone, and this time no happy pills For my birthday she give me beautiful Chanel makeup bag. It's a knock-off, but it's big "
"Frasier: Oh, all right then, this is my "
"question: if Dr. Crane and Mrs. Crane were to get back together, do you... do you think Mrs. Crane would treat Dr. Crane better? "
"Marta: Oh, jess, please ask Dr. Crane to come home. "
"Frasier: Marta, you've been most helpful. You know, lately I've been wondering if Niles and Maris ought to be together. Now, thanks to you, I know that the answer to that question is yes. "
"Frasier: What? Did I say something funny? "
"Marta: No, my beeper's on vibrate, it tickled me. Sorry, I have to go, Missy Crane needs me. "
"Frasier: Oh, that's all right, I understand. "
"Marta: Thanks for coffee. Call me "
"Frasier: Well, there is a limit "
"Daphne: Hey. "
"Frasier: Oh, Daphne. "
"Daphne: Was that Mrs. Crane's Marta who was just leaving? "
"Frasier: Yes it was, we were just sharing a coffee. You know, I wanted to help allay some of my fears about Niles and Maris getting back together. "
"Daphne: Yes, I expect she'll be glad to see Dr. Crane back in that household. Well, I should get my beans. "
"Frasier: Wait, wait, Daphne, what do you mean? "
"Daphne: Well, I'm sure Dr. Crane acts as a good buffer between Mrs. Crane and the help. "
"Frasier: Gee, it never occurred to me that Marta might have an ulterior motive. "
"Daphne: Who can blame her? Mrs. Crane can be a bit demanding. "
"Frasier: Well, this taints Marta's entire testimony. Is it possible she could have lied to me? Now then, with my training there aren't many things that can escape my notice, as I'm sure you've observed, Daphne. Gee, how could she lie to me? Now you see the predicament I am in. Every time somebody gives me a valid argument, somebody else comes along and gives me a perfectly valid counter-argument. One minute I think the answer is yes, the next minute I think it's no God, this is driving me crazy. Well, I've got to stick with it, Niles asked me what I think... that's it... what I think Of course I don't know what I think right now, well. But it's hard to be focused... "
"Frasier: Don't you agree, Daphne? "
"Daphne: Oh, yes, absolutely "
"TO: "
"Elise: I'm so glad we're finally doing this. "
"Frasier: Hmmm? Me too. "
"Elise: Is everything all right, Frasier? "
"Frasier: Oh, yes, yes, I'm just a little preoccupied. "
"Frasier: Stop obsessing Enjoy the date "
"Frasier: Here we are. "
"Elise: So, where are we going? "
"Frasier: Well, I've chosen a little Italian place I know, if that's all right? "
"Elise: I trust your judgment, but then who doesn't? "
"Elise: Are you okay? "
"Frasier: Oh, I'm sorry. Well, I told myself I wasn't going to bring this up to you, and I don't really think it's appropriate for a first date, but I haven't been able to think about anything else all day, so here "
"goes: Do you think it's possible for two people to be meant for each other? "
"Elise: You've thought about that all day? "
"Frasier: Yes. "
"Elise: Why, yes I do "
"Frasier: You do. But how do you know that they're meant for each other? Of course it's essential they have similar interests, goals in common... "
"Elise: Don't forget physical attraction. "
"Frasier: Oh, well, that's a given. But you know, my ex-wife had all those things, our marriage was an unmitigated disaster. "
"Elise: She probably just didn't appreciate you. "
"Frasier: No, not entirely. "
"Elise: Did she listen to your show everyday, sometimes even tape them so she could listen to it in bed at night? "
"Frasier: I didn't have a show then. I just- what it comes down to is, what is that special something that makes us cry out, 'Yes, you're meant to be together' "
"Elise: Who knows, all that matters is that we both feel it [a look of horrified realisation flashes across Frasier's face] I should have told you months ago how I felt, but I was too insecure. I never dreamed you felt the same way I did. Frasier, don't turn shy on me now. What'cha thinking? "
"Frasier: Elise, I'm thinking you are quite the practical joker Pretending not to know that I was really talking about my brother, Niles, and his wife. Surely Roz must have told you? "
"Elise: Oh, yes. "
"Frasier: Sense of humour, that's another thing for two to have in common. "
"Elise: Frasier, I have a headache, I think I'm gonna just take a rain-check on tonight, okay? "
"Frasier: Elise, we can still go out, just pretend that none of this ever happened "
"Elise: Perfect "
"TO: "
"Frasier: I can't for the life of me figure out why this decision is causing me so much anxiety. There's just so many things to be considered, you know. "
"Frasier: On the one hand, you know, perhaps I'm afraid if Niles and Maris reconcile, well then we may lose the friendship he and I developed during their separation. On the other hand, if Maris does take him back, well then I won't have to feel so responsible for him. There's just so much at stake "
"Frasier: Oh, not that kind of steak Listen, you're driving me crazy, I can't hear myself think here, I'm going to take a walk. "
"Frasier: Oh, not with you. Go away. Time for your bath "
"Frasier: So gullible "
"TO: "
"episode: "
"Roz: Tell him what he wants to hear. "
"Martin: He takes your opinion pretty damn seriously "
"Marta: Missy Crane very different, nicer to everyone. "
"Martin: Bazoo Bazoo Shut your bazoo "
"Roz: Fat Fat Fat Fat "
"Eddie: "
"Niles: Who's there? "
"Frasier: It's Frasier, let me in. "
"Niles: How did you get up here? "
"Frasier: Well, the doorman was asleep. "
"Niles: Well, what a coincidence, so was I. "
"Frasier: I'm sorry, Niles, I apologise for the late hour. "
"Niles: What's wrong? You smell of the streets "
"Frasier: Well, I was wandering Seattle in desperate search for an answer to your question. I know how crucial my opinion is to you and I didn't want to take your question lightly. "
"Niles: ...What question? "
"Frasier: You asked me if I thought you and Maris were meant for each other. "
"Niles: Oh, right. "
"Frasier: I can't believe it I've been to hell and back agonizing over this question and you forgot "
"Niles: No, no, no, I didn't forget. I'm sorry, Frasier, I'm groggy. Come in, come in. "
"Niles: I'm touched that you've given this so much thought. You're a good brother. "
"Frasier: Thank you. "
"Niles: So, please. "
"Frasier: Well, this is hard for me to say but... no. "
"Niles: What? "
"Frasier: I don't think you and Maris are meant to be together. I believe that a marriage should be built on a foundation of friendship and mutual respect. With Maris I fear that you never experienced those things fully. And I question whether you'll ever be truly happy. "
"Niles: "
"Frasier: You're hurt, aren't you? "
"Niles: No, I-I just need some time to process this. I appreciate you stopping by, it's just that it's one of those times I need to be alone. "
"Frasier: Did you just hear a bell? "
"Niles: No. Glad you came, go home, get some rest... "
"Frasier: There it is again. "
"Niles: No, I don't think so. "
"Frasier: Wait a minute... Oh, Niles Maris is here, isn't she? How could you? "
"Niles: Well, she offered and I said yes. "
"Frasier: How could you do something like this without waiting for my opinion? "
"Niles: Well, someone certainly has a high opinion of his opinion "
"Frasier: Oh, why don't you just go run back to her before she sprains her wrist "
"Niles: Frasier, Frasier, I know what you're thinking, but you're wrong. Maris has changed. She now understands that she cannot control me. I am my own man. "
"Niles: I don't actually respond to that. It's a little joke we have between us. Okay, that means business "

"Frasier: Oh Roz, I managed to get some reservations at San Gennaro tonight. I thought we'd go celebrate your birthday. "
"Roz: Oh, that is so sweet, but I have a date. With that waiter we met at lunch yesterday. "
"Frasier: You're going out with that guy? "
"Roz: I didn't have enough for a tip. "
"Frasier: Keep in mind the service wasn't that good. Well, the reservation won't go to waste. I can always take Niles. "
"Roz: Niles? Again? You know, your entire social life consists of going out with your brother. Don't you think you're getting into kind of a rut? You're still young You need to go out and get drunk... "
"Roz: Wake up in some stranger's bed and not even remember how you got there. "
"Frasier: In other words, exchange my life for yours. "
"Roz: Well, do what you want. But you know what? You could shake up your life every once in a while, do something spur of the moment. Once, I finished work on a Friday and hopped a plane to Acapulco, and I didn't pack anything but my toothbrush. "
"Frasier: Oh, yes, yes, I do remember you calling in sick one Monday morning with a mariachi band in the background. "
"Roz: Well, I was sick. "
"Frasier: Mmm-hmmm. "
"Daphne: Oh, Doctor Crane "
"Niles: Daphne. "
"Daphne: Thank God you're here. My zip's stuck. "
"Niles: Oh. "
"Niles: Good thing I got here when I did. "
"Daphne: Don't be afraid to grab hold and give it all you've got. "
"Niles: Okay. "
"Daphne: Sometimes pulling it down a bit helps. "
"Niles: Oh, dear. I've zipped my tie into your dress. It won't come loose. "
"Daphne: Oh, let me see "
"Daphne: Oh, I'm sorry It is stuck, isn't it? Well, maybe some liquid soap from the powder room will loosen it up. "
"Frasier: Niles, there's something on your tie. "
"Daphne: Doctor Crane was helping me with my dress, and now he's caught. "
"Frasier: Yes, he is. [walks to Daphne, pushing Niles to the side slightly] Allow me. Ah, there. All right, there we go. "
"Daphne: What a relief. I was just about to step right out of this dress and embarrass poor Doctor Crane to death. "
"Niles: Well, we all have to die of something. "
"Frasier: Oh Niles, I managed to score some reservations tonight at San Gennaro. You up for a little Italian? "
"Niles: Actually, I'm going out with Maris, so I guess you could say I'm up for a little Episcopalian. "
"Frasier: Like some sherry? "
"Niles: Yes, thank you. "
"Frasier: So, those counseling session must be going very well. "
"Niles: They are So, tonight, we thought it would be a kick to recreate our very first date. "
"Daphne: Oh, that's sweet. "
"Niles: Hey, dad. In fact, that day my car was in the shop, so I'm here to borrow Dad's car just like I did back then. [Frasier hands him his sherry] Just saying that makes me feel so young. 'Gee, Dad, can I borrow the car?' "
"Martin: You did that twice on the phone, and I didn't find it cute then. Here you go. "
"Frasier: I just can't picture Maris in Dad's '82 Impala. "
"Niles: Neither could she, at first. I'll never forget the look of wonder on her face at touching vinyl for the first time. She said it made her feel cheap and dirty, and she liked it. "
"Frasier: Uh-huh. Yes, I remember the way you used to carry your inhaler around rolled up in the sleeve of your t-shirt. [gesturing to Daphne at the table and Martin coming out of the kitchen] Oh, how about you two? You guys want to join me for dinner tonight? "
"Martin: Oh sorry, Sherry's cooking me dinner tonight. "
"Daphne: And I have a date with Greg. "
"Frasier: Greg? I don't believe I've met him yet. "
"Martin: I have. He's gorgeous. Well, he is. "
"Daphne: He's certainly the best-looking man I've ever been out with. Of course, he doesn't have a thought in that pretty little head of his. Hmmm, this could be the one. "
"Martin: But you know, Frasier, maybe I can have Sherry cook for me some other time. "
"Frasier: No, no. You don't have to put yourself out on my account, Dad. Oh Dad, did you happen to check this message? "
"Martin: No, I don't touch that thing. "
"Message: Hi, it's Laura. We're getting an extra day of rehearsal, so I'm coming in tonight instead of tomorrow. American, Flight 11, 10"
":30. Can't wait. Bye "
"Frasier: Great news, Laura's in town "
"Niles: Who's Laura? "
"Frasier: A stranger who called my machine by mistake. "
"Frasier: Reservation for Doctor Frasier Crane. "
"D: From the radio, yes? "
"Frasier: Yes. Ooh, actually my date canceled, so it'll just be me. "
"D: I see, sir. Table for one. "
"Frasier: There is no need to lower your voice. I'm not ashamed to dine alone. eally, as a man of some celebrity, I can serve as a symbol to others who might otherwise be afraid to do so. I mean, really it's okay, it's actually even preferable to sit and dine alone rather than listen to someone who's too much in love with his own voice prattle on endlessly. "
"D: Well, you convinced me, sir. I'll see if your table's ready. "
"D: Doctor Crane? Your table for one is ready. "
"Frasier: Uh, listen, is it possible to move to... to have a table elsewhere? I feel just a bit conspicuous right here. "
"Waiter: I'm very sorry, sir, but they're all reserved. But don't worry, most of our patrons only have eyes for each other. "
"Frasier: Very well. "
"Waiter: I'm so sorry, sir. "
"Frasier: Perfectly all right. Just because I'm alone doesn't mean I'm lonely. Perhaps I could have a glass of your house cabernet. "
"Johnny: Hi. "
"Frasier: Hello. What's your name? "
"Johnny: Johnny. How come nobody's sitting with you? "
"Frasier: Well, that's a bit complicated, Johnny. "
"Johnny: My mom and dad said it's okay if you come sit with us. "
"Frasier: Oh, well, that's a very... very sweet offer, and I know it's hard for a young boy to understand, but really, there's nothing wrong with someone eating by himself. "
"Johnny: You know, one time I was really bad at school and the teacher made me eat lunch all by myself. "
"Frasier: Oh, well that gave you an opportunity to think about your actions, didn't it? "
"Johnny: Nope. I just cried. "
"Frasier: Run along, Johnny. "
"Waiter: Your glass of cabernet, sir. "
"Frasier: Oh, thank you. "
"Waiter: Oh, and I see your candle has gone out. Enrico "
"Frasier: Please, stop Tonight, I'd prefer to just... dine in the shadows, thank you. "
"Woman: Excuse me. Are you here by yourself? "
"Frasier: As a matter of fact I am, yes. "
"Woman: I was hoping you'd say that Would you mind if I - "
"Frasier: Oh, good Lord, yes. I've actually been sitting here hoping somebody would- make good use of that chair. "
"Amanda: AAAHHHH Of course I'll marry you "
"Ethan: Oh, sorry for the commotion, folks. [notices spilled wine, walks over] Oh, gosh, is that our fault? Listen, let me pay for the dry cleaning "
"Frasier: Oh, not to worry, not to worry. "
"D: Congratulations, you two Here's to young love "
"Husband: Well, as long as we're all sharing good news, my wife just told me that we're having twins. "
"Ethan: Now that I've already interrupted all of your meals, I'd just like to share my joy with everyone here. [gazes at his fiance] To Amanda, my future bride, I will love you every day of my life, and I hope that, when we die, it's at the exact same moment so that neither of us will have to spend even one second alone again. "
"Frasier: Hi, um, Johnny said I could eat with you. "
"TO: "
"Martin: Hey, Fras, how was your dinner? "
"Frasier: Not since Quasimodo strolled the streets of medieval Paris have so many people uttered the phrase, 'That poor man.' "
"Daphne: I'm sure it wasn't as bad as all that. "
"Frasier: Oh? "
"Daphne: Oh, dear. "
"Frasier: The height of the evening came when the entire staff of waiters delivered the birthday cake that I'd ordered for Roz and neglected to cancel. They sang to me. "
"Martin: It's not your birthday. "
"Frasier: Staying right with the story as usual, Dad. Anyway, after dinner I took a long stroll, and it suddenly struck "
"me: I'm single. I'd gotten accustomed to thinking of myself as recently divorced, but that was five years ago. I'm forty- three, and I'm alone. "
"Martin: Hey I have something that'll cheer you up. I brought you some of Sherry's mock apple pie. It's called 'mock' cause they uses crackers instead of apples. "
"Frasier: Good Nothing spoils an apple pie like apples. Oh, Niles. "
"Niles: Frasier Oh, what happened? "
"Frasier: Well- "
"Niles: No, let me guess. Robust color, fruity bouquet. I'd say that's an amusing little merlot. "
"Frasier: Cabernet. "
"Niles: Oh. Well, it's still amusing. "
"Daphne: So, did you and Mrs. Crane enjoy recreating your first date? "
"Niles: Oh yes, my Maris remembered details that I'd forgotten. For example, when I brought her home after the restaurant, we took a stroll around the grounds. Suddenly, Marta appeared on the balcony playing the part of Maris's late father. She was liquored up on Rob Roys and firing Swedish meatballs at me from an antique blunderbuss. "
"Frasier: Dad, am I the only one in this household who checks this machine? "
"Laura: Hi, Molly. Laura again. "
"Frasier: Again. "
"Laura: Is that Tom on the machine? He sounds nice. Anyway, I just called to remind you I'll have my cello with me. "
"Translation: you might want to clean out your car this time to make room. I know, toujours la grande souer. Anyway, I can't wait to see you guys. I've been on my own way too much lately. See you at 10"
":30, Flight 11. Love you. Goodbye. "
"Daphne: Too bad there's no way to call her back. She's gonna be stranded at the airport. "
"Frasier: Oh no, she won't, she'll take a cab. "
"Daphne: You know, that happens a lot. People leaving wrong messages. And after hearing a stranger's voice like that, it always starts me wondering what they must be like. "
"Martin: Oh, you can't really judge what a person's like from the voice. "
"Niles: That's true. I was once told that I sound - imagine the impertinence - 'UP-TIGHT.' "
"Daphne: Well, she sounds to me like a very attractive woman. Intelligent - "
"Niles: She speaks French. "
"Frasier: I always loved the name Laura. "
"Martin: Hey Frasier, you know, that was gonna be your name if you were a girl. "
"Frasier: Really? "
"Martin: Yeah Your mother always wanted Priscilla, but I never liked the nickname 'Prissy.' "
"Niles: Mmmm, I never much cared for it, either. "
"Daphne: You know, Doctor Crane, this Laura sounds like she might just be a perfect match for you. If you left now, you could meet that plane. "
"Frasier: Oh, please, Daphne, a couple phone calls and you're fixing us up already. "
"Daphne: But think about it She plays the cello. You'd like that. "
"Niles: She appreciates neatness. "
"Martin: She expresses affection easily. That's good. [receives stares from everyone] Well, pardon me for growing a little, okay? "
"Niles: She did mention being on her own too much. So we know she's available. "
"Frasier: Oh, sure it's fun to speculate, but, come on, you can't seriously be suggesting- "
"Daphne: But why not? I can't imagine a more exciting way to meet. The woman of your dreams steps off a plane, and there you are to rescue her. "
"Martin: Oh, yeah, you can't beat meeting somebody in a romantic way. That's the way it was with me and your mom. "
"Niles: You met Mother over the chalk outline of a murder victim. "
"Martin: So? It was romantic to us. "
"Daphne: I met a boy in a cute way once. I was eighteen and visiting Stonehenge and this smashing young man came up to me and told me he was an actual descendent of the Druids. "
"Frasier: Boy, is that the one place that line would work. "
"Niles: I met someone once flying home from college. I got bumped into first class, found myself sitting there next to a positively ravishing woman. She was a bit older and I was trying desperately to be suave, so when she leaned over and suggested we join the Mile High Club, rather than admit I was unfamiliar with the term, I whispered back, 'I really don't travel enough to make that worthwhile.' [pauses, takes a sip of sherry] God, that was twenty years ago. [starts to chuckle, then] Nope, still can't laugh about it. "
"Laura: Hi, Molly. Laura again. Is that Tom on the machine? He sounds nice. Anyw- "
"Frasier: She likes the sound of my voice. She's called me twice today. That's already the best relationship I've had this year. "
"Martin: So, are you going? "
"Frasier: Maybe. Oh, I don't know. "
"Daphne: There's nothing worse than when you look back on a missed opportunity. "
"Frasier: What the hell "
"Daphne: Oh, I'm so excited. "
"Frasier: I can't believe I'm actually doing this "
"Niles: Frasier, before you go- "
"Frasier: No, Niles, stop right there Don't say another word to me I'll never do something this impulsive if I stop to overthink it. Just let me get the hell out of here before I change my mind "
"Frasier: But not before I change my shirt. "
"TO: "
"letters: "
"Laura: Thanks for all your help. I can take it from here. "
"Frasier: Uh, Laura? Looking for Molly? "
"Laura: Yes, I am. Molly sent a driver? "
"Frasier: Oh, no, no, no. I'm not a driver, I'm a psychiatrist, I'm here to help you. "
"Laura: Molly's having me committed? "
"Frasier: No, no, no I'm Doctor Frasier Crane. "
"Laura: Oh, from the radio "
"Frasier: Oh, you know me "
"Laura: Yes, I've heard your show, it's great But your knowing me is just - weird. "
"Frasier: Well, actually... you left a couple messages on my machine today by mistake. "
"Laura: Oh, no. I must've gotten my sister's new number wrong. "
"Frasier: I didn't want you waiting around for someone who wasn't coming. "
"Laura: So you came all the way down here? What're you, like the nicest guy in the world? "
"Frasier: Yes. Yes, I am. Well, speaking of nice, I would be delighted to drive you to your sister's home. "
"Laura: Oh, no, no, no, I'll take a cab. "
"Frasier: Are you sure? It's no trouble at all. "
"Laura: Well, she lives an hour away. But, uh, listen, could I buy you a drink just to say thank you? "
"Frasier: Yes, I'd love that. May I take your cello? "
"Laura: Aaahhhh... I checked my cello, this is my purse. "
"Laura: I think that's funny. Why doesn't anybody laugh at that? "
"Frasier: That is funny Here. [takes case, leads them toward airport bar] So, are you with an orchestra? [puts cello case to the side] "
"Laura: With a chamber music group, actually. We're based in LA, but we travel quite a bit. I grew up here, so it's always nice to come back. I miss it. "
"Frasier: So, what'll you have? "
"Laura: Um... I think I'll have a glass of sherry. "
"Frasier: Two. "
"Laura: Not that you can expect that much from airport bar sherry. Oh, goodness. Don't I sound like the perfect snob? "
"Frasier: I mean, I agree with you about the sherry. So... um... why did you choose the cello? "
"Laura: When I was around eleven, my father took me to the symphony. And this sounds a little silly, but when I heard the cello, it sounded sad, like it needed me. "
"Frasier: That's not silly. It's lovely. "
"Laura: I was always an odd kid. All my girlfriends had posters of David Cassidy. I had Pablo Cassall. "
"Frasier: I had Sigmund Freud. "
"Laura: But did you kiss him every night before you went to bed? "
"Frasier: Well, I... I was tempted to, but he just would've read too much into it Oh, thank you. "
"Laura: I don't think I've ever shared a drink with a psychiatrist. I'm worried that you must be analyzing me. "
"Frasier: Well, if I am, my diagnosis so far is that I... I can't find a single thing wrong with you. "
"Laura: Actually, it's quite good "
"Frasier: Yes. My second pleasant surprise this evening. "
"Laura: Frasier, maybe I'm misreading you here, but - I'm married. "
"Frasier: Oh... somehow I jumped to the conclusion that you were single. Wasn’t there something in your message about having been on your own too much, lately? "
"Laura: Oh, I've been away on tour. "
"Frasier: Oh... Well, I guess by now you've probably figured out that my coming down here wasn't entirely the act of a Good Samaritan. More like a lonely Samaritan. Guess it makes me seem sort of desperate. "
"Laura: No... I think it makes you seem sort of romantic. I used to do things like this when I was single. It was fun. "
"Frasier: Clearly, you were better at being single than I am. "
"Laura: Oh, come on. Let me ask you a question. How did you feel, coming down here? "
"Frasier: I felt... completely exhilarated. In fact, it's the most fun I've had in recent memory. "
"Laura: Exactly. The anticipation, the excitement, the hope. Marriage is the death of all that. "
"Frasier: I hope you didn't write your own vows. "
"Laura: I'm not down on marriage. It's just that marriage can be great, but so can not being married. "
"Frasier: I suppose. Well, you're smart, lovely, talented, able to look at the bright side of things. I'm getting more disappointed by the moment. "
"Laura: I'm sorry it didn't turn out the way you wanted. "
"Frasier: Oh, don't be. Look, I really did have fun. You know, it's not very often that I do something impulsive. "
"Laura: Well, maybe you should. Well, I really should be going. "
"Frasier: Oh, no, here, allow me. Allow me. I'm the nicest guy in the world, remember? "
"Laura: I'll remember. "
"Frasier: Here we are. "
"Laura: This is probably a ridiculous thing to say, but if I weren't married- "
"Frasier: No, you don't have to finish that, but thank you very much for starting it. "
"Laura: Okay. "
"Frasier: Oh Let me get that for you. "
"Laura: If you ever think back on this, could you just- "
"Frasier: I'll just edit that part out. "
"Laura: Thank you. "
"Announcement: ...4 will depart from Gate 31. Passengers may proceed to the.... "
"Woman: Excuse me. "
"Frasier: Mmm-hmmm? "
"Woman: Did you just hear that gate change announcement? "
"Frasier: Oh, no, no, I'm sorry, but perhaps they can help you at the ticket counter. "
"Woman: Oh, good idea. Thanks. "
"Frasier: Where're you headed? "
"Woman: Mexico. How about you? "
"Frasier: Oh well, I'm just going to finish up my sherry, and then I'm off to.... I'm going to Mexico "
"Woman: Really? Acapulco? "
"Frasier: It's uncanny What hotel are you staying at? "
"Woman: Via Terra. "
"Frasier: Why, that's where I'm staying You're scaring me "

"Joanne: Well, I should warn you. If we hit turbulence, I may hold on to you for dear life. "
"Frasier: I should warn you, I'm hoping for a bumpy ride "
"Joanne: Why are you going to Acapulco? "
"Frasier: Actually, it's rather an amusing story. You see, I came down to the airport on sort of a blind date with a cello player. Of course, she didn't know it was a blind date, actually, it was all in my head. But, er, so I bumped into you and you said you were going to Acapulco, I thought I might tag along. "
"Joanne: So, the only reason you're on this plane is because of me? "
"Frasier: Call it Kismet. "
"Joanne: Can I switch seats? "
"Crew: You're lucky, normally this flight is jammed. "
"Frasier: See, Kismet "
"Felicity: I didn't mean to eavesdrop, but I have to say, I'd be flattered if someone got on a plane to be with me. "
"Frasier: Really? "
"Felicity: Yeah, I mean what can be more romantic than that? "
"Frasier: You know, it's a little awkward trying to talk like this. Is that seat taken? "
"Felicity: No, come sit here, please. "
"Frasier: At last. I'm Frasier Crane. "
"Felicity: Felicity Stafford. "
"Frasier: It's a pleasure. "
"Felicity: And this is my husband, David. "
"Frasier: Oh, darn I forgot to order my kosher meal. So sorry. It was lovely meeting you both. "
"Kelly: Oh, thank God the flight's late, I was sure I'd missed it. Thank you. "
"Kelly: Yes, it's me. Amazing what they can do with make- up and lighting. "
"Frasier: Yes, it is amazing. Not that they didn't have plenty to work with. [digging himself into a hole] Oh, by plenty, I don't mean anything referring to... well... ...here, you just stay right here, I'll change seats. "
"Kelly: No, no, wait. Your voice sounds really familiar. "
"Frasier: I'm Dr. Frasier Crane from the radio. "
"Kelly: "
"Frasier: Well, I'm assuming that you're off to a photo shoot on the beaches of Mexico. "
"Kelly: No, actually, I only model part-time these days. I'm in a PhD department with the University of Washington. "
"Frasier: What's your field? "
"Kelly: Zoology. That's why I'm going to Mexico, to observe the spiny cald iguana. "
"Frasier: A model and a scholar. This is the part where I normally wake up. "
"Frasier: I know what you're thinking. "
"Kelly: Hmmm? "
"Frasier: Last night, walking along the beach when we kicked off our shoes and looked up at the amazing blanket of stars... "
"Kelly: Actually, I was remembering when that iguana ran across my foot and you jumped into my arms. "
"Frasier: Yes, that too. You're really quite strong. "
"Kelly: I am a supermodel So, Frasier, any chance you'd be interested in seeing more of me? "
"Frasier: There's more? Of course, of course, I was hoping we would. "
"Kelly: Well, that's great. Actually, there's one thing I should mention. It's a little awkward. "
"Frasier: What is? "
"Kelly: Well, I'm in the process of breaking up with someone; he plays for the Seahawks and we're always in the public eye, these things have a way of getting out. I'd appreciate it if just for now you didn't tell anyone about you and me. "
"Frasier: What happened between us will never leave this room. "
"Frasier: And if there's a God in heaven, neither will we "
"Roz: Have you seen Frasier? "
"Bulldog: What, he's not back from the airport yet? "
"Roz: No. That's a lot of cheese and crackers, you're going to eat all those? "
"Bulldog: Don't be stupid, I'm having people over tonight. "
"Frasier: Morning, all. "
"Roz: There you are, I almost gave up on you. "
"Roz: So, Mr. Impulsive, I got your message. How was Mexico? "
"Frasier: Fine, relaxing. "
"Roz: Oh, I'm sorry. "
"Frasier: Sorry? "
"Roz: Yeah, well, considering what a bump your sex life has been lately, I know you were looking for a little of, well, you know, action. You know, south of the border. "
"Frasier: Roz, just because the last time you went to Mexico you were hit on more than a piñata, that doesn't mean that was the purpose of my visit as well. "
"Roz: Oh, yeah, right, you wanted to hear that Acapulco Philharmonic "
"Bulldog: So, doc', did you get any? "
"Frasier: That is none of your business "
"Bulldog: Ah, well, better luck next time. "
"Frasier: Did it ever occur to you that I'm merely being discreet? That I actually did meet a woman, I just don't care to broadcast it? "
"Bulldog: Sure, that'll happen "
"Frasier: Please You know, frankly, I don't have time for this nonsense. What I did or did not do on my vacation is none of your concern. Don't you have better things to do than just speculate about my sex life? "
"Bulldog: Oh, 'Frasier Crane's sex life.' Hey, there's a word for that... it's an Oxy... Oxy... "
"Roz: ...moron "
"Bulldog: Hey, wow, easy, I'll get it. "
"Daphne: All right, now, flip over, ten kicks on each side. "
"Martin: Oh, Jeez, I hate this one. What does it do anyway? "
"Daphne: Nothing for you, but it does get a nice breeze going. "
"Daphne: Hello, Dr. Crane. "
"Niles: Daphne. "
"Niles: Hello, Eddie. Good boy, dad. "
"Martin: That's it, I'm through. "
"Niles: So, where's Frasier? "
"Daphne: Oh, he got in a while ago but jumped right in the shower. "
"Niles: So we still have no idea why he went to Mexico? "
"Martin: Well, you heard the same message we did. He wanted to do something spur of the moment, so he jumped on a plane. "
"Niles: That doesn't concern you? That's not exactly like him, to board a plane without reservations and luggage... slumber mask. "
"Martin: Oh, he probably just went down there to try to meet some women. "
"Niles: I've seen this with my patients. They get so distressed over a series of failures, especially romantic ones, that they act out in bizarre ways. "
"Frasier: Ah, is there anything more refreshing after a long flight than a hot soak in eucalyptus sauce and a snifter of warmed 'Poir William' "
"Niles: Nothing yet, but keep your ears open. "
"Daphne: You know, Dr. Crane, we're all awfully eager to hear about your trip. Did you have a nice time? "
"Frasier: Oh, yes, lovely. "
"Martin: Did you meet any girls? "
"Frasier: Ah, well, you know me, dad, I'm not one to kiss and tell. "
"Martin: Struck out, huh? Well, it'll all turn around for ya'. "
"Frasier: Why does everyone assume that it's impossible for me to meet a woman? "
"Martin: No need to get mad, I'm on your side, I just feel bad for you. "
"Daphne: We all do. "
"Frasier: You know, frankly, I'm sick and tired of everyone's pity. The fact is I did meet a woman down there, a perfectly fabulous woman, we had an utterly romantic weekend. "
"Martin: Why didn't you just tell us that from the start? "
"Frasier: Well, I'm not at liberty to discuss it. "
"Niles: Oh, yes, that pesky Club Med oath of silence "
"Frasier: No She asked me to be discreet. You see, she's a rather famous supermodel and right now she's going through a break- up with a star football player on the Seahawks. Didn't want any publicity, so you see, before I identify her to you, I have to ask you not to ever to repeat this to anyone. "
"Niles: I'd urge you to do the same. "
"Frasier: Her name is Kelly Easterbrook "
"Daphne: Ah, the lotion girl She has such milky skin. "
"Frasier: I thought so, yes. We were inseparable the entire weekend. "
"Daphne: You know, some people think I look like her. "
"Frasier: Oh, yes. "
"Frasier: I've got a picture of her, I'll be right back. "
"Niles: Well, it's one thing to concoct a little white lie, but to come up with a supermodel? "
"Martin: Who dumped an NFL player for Frasier "
"Daphne: I think you two are just being awful, I've never known Dr. Crane to tell a lie. "
"Niles: Actually, this is not without precedent. When he was ten, he forged letters from Leonard Bernstein and told everyone they were pen pals. "
"Martin: Oh, yeah. "
"Niles: He'd come bounding up the stairs, 'Got another one from Lenny' We were all agog until Mr. Bernstein wrote that his Broadway debut was 'Candide' when everyone knows that it was 'On The Town.' That's when we knew it was a fake "
"Martin: The sloppy kid lettering was also a clue "
"Frasier: Here she is. "
"Martin: Is this from a magazine? "
"Frasier: Yeah, yeah, she's in lots of magazines and billboards too. And now she's my girlfriend. "
"Frasier: Well, I'm off to bed. I didn't get much sleep over the weekend, you know what I mean "
"Daphne: He just snapped like a twig, didn't he "
"Frasier: Hello. Kelly. Hi, gee, I didn't know you were back in town. Er, I'd love to. Right, well, I'll see you there, in what, half an hour? Okay. Well, yeah, me too. Bye. "
"Niles: Frasier, glad we caught you. We're off to the Buster Keaton retrospective, care to join us? "
"Frasier: Actually, I'm dashing off to 'L'Escalias' for a late lunch with Kelly. "
"Niles: Oh, your supermodel. "
"Martin: You didn't mention anything about that when you left this morning. "
"Frasier: She just called, she came up early from a modeling assignment in Hawaii, I suspect to see you-know-who. "
"Frasier: Yes, Dr. Crane. Listen, I need my usual table in about twenty minutes. Oh yes, and chill your finest bottle of Pouilly Fuissé. Well, modeling those swimsuits, she works up quite a thirst "
"Daphne: Poor sod. "
"Niles: Doesn't he realise how outlandish it all sounds? "
"Martin: Even a fake supermodel would have dumped him by now "
"Daphne: I wish there was something we could do. "
"Niles: There is. When he was in the phase of his Leonard Bernstein obsession, we finally confronted him, and, as you may recall, Dad, he was relieved that once and for all he could give up the charade. "
"Martin: Char-ade. "
"Niles: Cha-rade. "
"Martin: Well, I guess we could talk to him. But what are we going to say? "
"Niles: It won't be easy. So, tell him that we know what's going on and that he doesn't have to pretend anymore. "
"Daphne: All right, but situations like that make me uncomfortable. "
"Martin: Well, you know, there's always the outside chance that we'll walk into that restaurant and some gorgeous supermodel will be draped all over Frasier... "
"Daphne: We needed that. "
"Martin: Yeah, I thought we could do with a little tension breaker "
"Kelly: Frasier. "
"Frasier: You look wonderful. "
"Kelly: Oh, thank you. "
"Frasier: Here, here, sit. I ordered some appertisers. "
"Kelly: Oh, this is so sweet, but I can't stay. My lab called and there's been a small emergency. "
"Frasier: Is everything alright? "
"Kelly: Our incubator broke and my iguana eggs need to be moved to another lab right away. I hope you understand. "
"Frasier: Well, of course I'm disappointed, but we'll do it again sometime. "
"Kelly: I'll call you as soon as I'm done at the lab. "
"Frasier: Great, okay. "
"Frasier: I'll keep my fingers crossed, here's hoping your eggs are still fertile. "
"Waiter: My wife had trouble conceiving too. It turned out to be me "
"Frasier: Well, mystery solved, off you go. "
"Niles: Oh, that is so sad. "
"Daphne: I'll say, nobody's ever bought me caviar and I'm real [off Martin and Niles' glance] Maybe this is a family thing. "
"Frasier: Is something the matter? "
"Martin: Oh, we were just in the neighbourhood. Thought we'd stop by, see if you've changed your mind about the movie. "
"Frasier: You seem to be awfully persistent, but you know, I just may join you. My date cancelled at the last moment. "
"Niles: Listen, Frasier. Whatever it is that makes you feel the need to perpetuate this fantasy woman, you don't have to on our account. "
"Frasier: Fantasy? "
"Martin: We're your family. We don't care if you haven't been out with anyone in quite a while. "
"Frasier: My God, you actually believe that I invented this relationship "
"Martin: Hey, Frasier, it's no crime to go down to Acapulco and come back empty-handed. "
"Frasier: I did not come back empty-handed, I came back with two huge handfuls Kelly was just here. She was called away on an emergency. "
"Niles: That would be a modeling emergency? "
"Frasier: No. She only models to raise money for her real "
"interest: zoology. She's a PhD candidate and she raises iguanas. [they obviously don't buy this] The incubator broke and her eggs were in danger, and it was vital that only she transfer them over... Oh, the details are not important. The fact is that I'm having a relationship with this woman "
"Martin: We love you Frasier. Niles, me, Daphne... "
"Niles: Leonard Bernstein. "
"Frasier: I knew one day you would throw that back in my face "
"Frasier: Kelly. "
"Kelly: Oh, hi. "
"Frasier: Hi. "
"Kelly: I was just leaving you a note. I'm really sorry about lunch. "
"Frasier: Oh, it's all right. Do you have time to come in? "
"Kelly: Sure. Good news is that I was able to move all of my eggs over to another lab. "
"Frasier: Well, I hope you didn't put them all in one basket. "
"Kelly: Why does everyone think that's funny? "
"Kelly: What a beautiful apartment. "
"Frasier: Thank you. Can I interest you in a glass of Beaujoulais Nouveau? "
"Kelly: I'd love some. "
"Frasier: All right. "
"Kelly: I actually have something to toast. My doctorate advisor's asked me to join his... [pauses as she notices Martin's chair] ...team of researchers going to the Galapagos Islands. "
"Frasier: Well, that does deserve a toast. "
"Kelly: I'm replacing someone, so it's all very last minute. We leave in the morning. I'll be there for two months, inseminating indigenous iguanas. I've called all my friends, they couldn't believe it. "
"Frasier: Nor will mine "
"Frasier: Two months? "
"Kelly: Hey, I feel terrible leaving town so early in our relationship, but it's the opportunity of a life-time. "
"Frasier: Well, I'll be here when you return. We'll always have one incredible night to look back on fondly. "
"Kelly: I think we'll be looking back on two incredible nights. "
"Frasier: No, I'm sorry darling, it's just one night; Saturday night, then of course Sunday, you were... "
"Frasier: Oh. Right, right. "
"Kelly: What was that? "
"Frasier: Nothing, nothing. "
"Kelly: I must have drifted off there. "
"Kelly: What's that noise? "
"Frasier: I don't hear anything? "
"Kelly: You took a picture of me while I was asleep? "
"Frasier: Absolutely not This is... it's your going away present. Bon Voyage. "
"Kelly: You're disgusting "
"Frasier: Oh, no, Kelly, Kelly, listen, please, you don't understand. "
"Kelly: I don't believe this Get out Get out "
"Frasier: You know, you think being a professional model, you might be a little more relaxed about somebody taking your... "
"Kelly: Get out "
"Frasier: Kelly, don't you think we should talk about this. I won't see you again for two months "
"Kelly: You won't see me again for a lot longer than that "
"Frasier: Kelly "
"Kelly: What? It wasn't enough just to tell people you bagged a model. You had to take a picture "
"Frasier: No "
"Kelly: What were you planning to do with it, sell it to the tabloids? "
"Frasier: No "
"Kelly: Pass it around the office, show it to all your friends? "
"Frasier: No, no, just my immediate family "
"Kelly: I'm taking the stairs. "
"Frasier: Kelly "
"Frasier: Kelly. "
"Frasier: Oh, you missed her again. She's running down the stairs, you can catch her if you still want to. "
"Martin: We believe you, Frasier, now let's just get your robe all cinched up. And get you back inside. "
"Frasier: Don't patronise me "
"Frasier: Oh, look, look, TWO wine glasses "
"Daphne: Oh, yes, one for you, one for her, that proves it all right "
"Frasier: I am dating a supermodel zoologist, who I stole away from a professional football player, and she is off to the Galapagos islands to artificially inseminate iguanas Is that so hard to believe? "
"Kelly: Frasier, I want to... Oh Well, good crowd Where were you all hiding, under the bed? [begins to rip out film from Frasier's camera] You know, it makes me sick to think I'd even spent one night with you, let alone two I have known a lot of reptiles and looked under a lot of rocks in my life, but I have never seen anything slither out quite as slimy and repulsive as you "
"Frasier: Well, what do you think of me now? "

"Frasier: Oh, good morning, Roz. "
"Roz: Good morning. "
"Frasier: What the hell was that? "
"Roz: Oh, shoot He's not even here "
"Frasier: Who? "
"Roz: Do you remember that guy who dumped me last month? I thought he was right behind me. I just wanted him to see me with another guy so he'd know how completely over him I am "
"Frasier: Good idea, Roz. If that doesn't work, why don't we get married and have some children, that will really fix his wagon "
"Roz: You might remember him, Stan? "
"Frasier: Stan? The smug stockbroker who kept calling me 'Frazer?' "
"Roz: Oh yeah, that's the one. One minute, we're hot an' heavy and then he stops calling. It's so humiliating when someone treats you like you don't even exist. "
"Frasier: How can someone not hear the difference between 'Frasier' and 'Frazer'? "
"Roz: Yeah, that's what bugged me the most too I'll have an espresso to go, please. "
"Frasier: Oh, oh, Roz, I almost forgot, here's the invitation to my dad's birthday party. Sherry's giving it, so please excuse the elegant verse, but... "
"Roz: 'Come one, Come all, To jump and jive, Marty Crane's turning sex-ty-five' "
"Roz: Oh my God, here he is. Please? "
"Frasier: Oh, all right. "
"Niles: Hello. "
"Frasier: Hello, Niles. You know, this isn't what it looks like. You see, her ex-boyfriend was just... Oh, just stop that "
"Niles: Please, no explanation necessary. I assume that at the next meeting of Seattle's 'Haven't Kissed Roz Club,' it will just be me and the archbishop "
"Roz: I'll save you the club fees. "
"Niles: What-? "
"Niles: Everyone kisses better than Maris "
"Frasier: Can I get one of the same for Dr. Crane, please? "
"Niles: I'm sorry I'm late, I was shopping for Dad's present. "
"Frasier: Oh, it's all right, Niles. I did a bit of that myself this morning. I found a lovely little calfskin wallet with a matching key case. "
"Niles: Oh. Well, bravo, Frasier. "
"Frasier: Yes, and it was a full twenty dollars below our agreed-upon spending limit. "
"Niles: Oh, I'm so glad we agreed to rein ourselves in this year. "
"Frasier: Oh God, me too. Finally to do away with our annual contest to see who could give dad the most lavish gift. "
"Niles: I think the competition had gotten a bit... er, what is the best word for it? "
"Frasier: Extreme. "
"Niles: No, childish. "
"Frasier: Gaudy. "
"Niles: Crass. "
"Frasier: Obscene. "
"Niles: Baroque. "
"Frasier: Stop it So, what did you get him? "
"Niles: Oh, just some... beer. "
"Frasier: Well, we're not exactly bumping our heads on that spending ceiling, are we? "
"Niles: It's a bit fancier than that. It's a membership in a beer club. They deliver a case from a different micro brewery every month. "
"Frasier: You know, I looked into those clubs, they're rather expensive. "
"Niles: Oh, not really. I'm right at our limit. Maybe with taxes and handling I'm a drop or two over. "
"Frasier: How big a drop? "
"Niles: Just, er... a hundred dollars over. "
"Frasier: That's not a drop, it's a downpour "
"Niles: It's a dribble. "
"Frasier: It's a deluge "
"Niles: It's a... "
"Frasier: Stop it "
"Niles: Oh, why don't you just stick a hundred dollars in that wallet of yours and we'll call it even. "
"Frasier: Well, frankly, I don't need to buy dad's love. You've opted to violate our agreement, so be it. I have a gift, you have a gift. "
"Niles: Fine. "
"Frasier: Big baby "
"Frasier: Stare all you like. You will not distract me from my paper. You see, your efforts are futile, I can't even see you. "
"Niles: It seems so unhealthy. Is she going to serve anything at Dad's party but meat? "
"Daphne: Sherry says that's what he and his old cronies like best. With drinks, she's serving cocktail franks. For appetisers, we're having a sausage medley. And for the main course there's a choice of meat loaf or meat balls. "
"Niles: I assume these colourful balloons are for the between course angioplasty "
"Sherry: Did you get everything, Daphne? "
"Daphne: Oh, yes, I think so. "
"Sherry: Good news, I found a guy who can sculpt an exact replica of Marty's old police badge out of six pounds of liverwurst. "
"Frasier: Oh, how reminiscent of the cream cheese gavel they gave Thurgood Marshall on his eightieth "
"Martin: Oh, we can't use this photograph, it's too embarrassing. "
"Sherry: That's exactly why we're using it. I'm decorating the whole party with old pictures of Marty from the force. "
"Martin: Well, we can't use this one of me at the morgue; it's too disturbing. "
"Niles: You're right, I totally forgot you even had a perm "
"Martin: Oh, God, I can't wait to see this guy again. Mickey Doogan. We rode mounted patrol together. "
"Sherry: Oh, look at you. You look so big and handsome on your horse. Oh my God, when was this taken? "
"Martin: April Fools' Day. "
"Frasier: Oh, yes, yes, that would explain why your horses are wearing brassieres. "
"Martin: Oh God, I loved that horse. Old Agides and I were together for eight years. Best partner I ever had. "
"Sherry: Oh, we should get going. "
"Martin: Okay. "
"Sherry: Marty, where ever did you find a bra that could fit a horse? "
"Martin: Oh, Mickey brought it in from home. Mae Doogan was a lot of things, but petite she wasn't I'll point her out to you at the party. "
"Sherry: Honey, if that's her bra, I can spot her myself. "
"Frasier: Well, er, sherry, Niles? "
"Niles: Oooh... ...no, thanks, I've got a session. "
"Frasier: Ah. "
"Daphne: Dr. Crane, is your father gone? "
"Frasier: Yes, he has. "
"Daphne: Good, then I'll wrap his present. They fit fine in this box. "
"Frasier: Great, Daphne, off you go. "
"Niles: Wait a minute. That box is awfully big for what you got him. "
"Daphne: No, it isn't. "
"Frasier: Ah, Daphne... "
"Daphne: Your binoculars fit just perfectly in here "
"Niles: You told me you got him a wallet and a key case "
"Daphne: Oh, no, not this again It's the same nonsense every year. "
"Frasier: Well, not this year. We'd actually agreed to a spending limit until someone else exceeded it. "
"Niles: All right, all right. Guilty as charged. We've each violated the pact once. Now let's stop before this madness gets out of hand. "
"Frasier: Well, if you ask me, your gifts compliment each other perfectly. "
"Niles: Em, Daphne... "
"Daphne: Your binoculars and your football tickets. "
"Frasier: Tickets? "
"Daphne: Season tickets to the Seahawks. "
"Frasier: I don't believe you You already had a better gift than mine, you still saw the need to take it to a higher level. "
"Niles: Only because I knew you were going to upgrade that wallet, which you did "
"Frasier: All right, enough is enough. I quit, I'm throwing in the towel. "
"Niles: Oh, and why should I believe you? "
"Frasier: Because this is a receipt for the binoculars, this should prove to you that I have no intention of returning them in order to get a better gift. There. "
"Niles: Well, that's very big of you. I'm late for my session. If it's any consolation, I'm not really sure how good those tickets are. I was hoping to get something on the first two yard lines but I could only get ones way back on the fiftieth "
"Daphne: Well, I'm very proud of you, Dr. Crane. I... "
"Frasier: Oh, stop babbling, Daphne, and bring me some tape "
"Daphne: Okay, the keg of beer will be there by six. I also confirmed the band, ordered the cake, filled out the place cards, picked up the humourous cocktail napkins and I'm almost done making the centerpieces. "
"Sherry: Oh, this party is just going to wear me out "
"Niles: Hello, Daphne, Sherry. Double Latte, please. Is Frasier with you? "
"Sherry: No, he's out shopping for your dad. "
"Niles: That jackal "
"Sherry: What was that all about? "
"Daphne: Brother snit. Don't ask. "
"Sherry: I forgot to tell you. I found this fabulous photograph of Marty arresting some guy. I had it blown up to life size, then I cut out the crook's face so people could stick their heads through and have a snap shot of Marty reading them their rights. Don't you just love it? "
"Daphne: It depends. Do I have to pick it up? "
"Sherry: By five, you're a doll "
"Daphne: Dr. Crane, did you find something? "
"Frasier: Yes, I did. It took me most of the afternoon but I finally came up with something I think is just about perfect "
"Sherry: Oh, Niles forgot his coffee. "
"Frasier: Niles was here? "
"Sherry: Yes, but you know, when I mentioned that you were out shopping for your dad he just shot out of here like a bullet "
"Frasier: That little worm "
"Daphne: Dr. Crane, are you all right? "
"Frasier: No, I am not. I've combed the entire city trying to find a gift - but nothing is better than what Niles got him. "
"Daphne: What did your brother get him? "
"Frasier: I don't know. I'm sure it's something any father would just love. "
"Martin: Why, you know the best thing about turning sixty-five? Everybody wants to buy you dinner "
"Daphne: Mr. Crane, you've left your top button unbuttoned. "
"Martin: Oh, yeah, that's because Duke's taking me to Hoppy's Old Heidelberg. You know, if I don't unbutton it now, it might fly off and hurt somebody "
"Frasier: Enjoy, Dad. "
"Martin: Oh, yeah, I will. I gotta tell 'ya, I'm loving this birthday. All of a sudden my money's no good. Last night, Ed Flannagan bought the whole bar a round in my honour. "
"Frasier: Who's Ed Flannagan? "
"Martin: That's what I asked Anyway, what are you doing tonight, Fras'? "
"Frasier: Er, nothing much. I've got some shopping to do. "
"Martin: Oh, for anybody we know? You know, Fras', every year, you and Niles, you go overboard trying to find these great presents for me and I've got to be honest, it's always made me kind of uncomfortable. "
"Frasier: Really? "
"Martin: Yeah. So this year, I just wanted you to know... I'm over it So, go crazy, you only turn sixty-five once "
"Daphne: You know, Dr. Crane, the last thing I want to do is encourage more competition between you and your brother. But if you really want to make your father happy, maybe the time has come... "
"Frasier: Oh, don't even say it "
"Daphne: But it's the only thing he's ever asked for "
"Frasier: No God, it'll ruin my apartment, my life I can't, I won't, I mustn't "
"Daphne: It's over, Dr. Crane. "
"Daphne: That is one big-screen TV. He's going to love it "
"Frasier: I know "
"Frasier: Perhaps I'm panicking needlessly. It just needs a little dressing-up, really. You know, I'll just arrange these plants here at the base. "
"Daphne: Yes, you always said you needed more greenery in here. "
"Frasier: Yes, maybe an objet or two on top. Yes, yes, this little bud vase, here. "
"Frasier: That makes a world of difference, doesn't it? "
"Daphne: Oh, sure it does, Dr. Crane. All the difference in the world "
"Frasier: Oh God, you just don't put a smear of lipstick on the Bride of Frankenstein and turn her into a trophy wife, do you? "
"Frasier: Niles. "
"Niles: Frasier, are you ready? We told dad we'd pick him up at... "
"Niles: Oh my God, you didn't? "
"Frasier: Didn't what? You mean buy dad this television set? Of course I did Ah, it's impressive, isn't it? "
"Niles: I knew how jealous you were, but to go to such insane lengths to top me... Frasier, you have lain waste to your apartment with this eyesore "
"Frasier: I disagree Where you see an eyesore, I see a picture window to a world of art and culture. Just think how a screen this size will enhance the majesty of the Metropolitan Opera. Or the thrilling artists of the Bolshoi "
"Niles: You're quite a Bolshoi artist yourself "
"Frasier: Oh, you're right, it's dreadful, isn't it But you know, it's worth it, just to imagine the smile it'll put on dad's face, not to mention the pleasure of watching you twist and writhe in envy. You're not twisting and writhing "
"Niles: I'm sorry, my mind wandered. I was remembering Dad waxing nostalgic the other day about his beloved old horse, Agides. "
"Frasier: Oh, don't try to change the subject, Niles, you've lost, admit it "
"Niles: He certainly did love that horse. "
"Frasier: You can only live in denial for so long before you... "
"Frasier: You didn't? "
"Niles: Didn't what? Buy the horse? Sorry, did "
"Frasier: Oh ... Oh... how could you? "
"Niles: I've already set him up in a handsome stable. Dad can visit him anytime he wants, which reminds me, I'd like to swing by the stable on the way to the party so dad can- look his gift horse in the mouth "
"Frasier: Ah, all right, Niles. What else can I do? I give up You win. You have found the one gift that can't be trumped. "
"Niles: Thank you, Frasier. You're a gracious loser. "
"Frasier: Still, on the bright side, I know dad will love this set. He really will. And already it doesn't seem quite as intrusive as it did when it first got here. "
"Daphne: Right this way. "
"Frasier: What are those? "
"Daphne: Your speakers. "
"Niles: So, dad, any idea where you are? "
"Martin: Oh, it's so mysterious. Hay under foot, stable smells, that saddle we just tripped over... I mean, we could be anywhere "
"Niles: All right, all right. "
"Martin: What? "
"Niles: Voila Happy birthday. "
"Martin: Agides Hey, buddy, how are you doing? Oh, long-time-no-see. What's going on? "
"Niles: He's yours, dad. "
"Martin: What? "
"Niles: I bought him for you. "
"Martin: You're kidding me, I can't believe it "
"Niles: You can visit him anytime you want. "
"Martin: This is amazing. How've you been, buddy, huh? Hey, one plus one equals? "
"Martin: He remembers "
"Niles: I figured it was a long shot when I called but they were a week away from putting him out to pasture, so I set him up here at Brier Wood, it's the most exclusive stable in town. Don't be surprised if you spy a certain resident trotting by wearing his triple crown. "
"Frasier: They don't give them actual crowns, you twit Well, come on, Dad, you don't want to be late for the party, I'm sure Sherry's getting warm in that cake "
"Frasier: Dad? "
"Martin: Huh? "
"Frasier: Don't want to be late. "
"Niles: Are you all right, dad? "
"Martin: Yeah, I'm fine. "
"Frasier: Are you sure? "
"Martin: Yeah, I said I was fine. Now, come on, let's go to my party. "
"Frasier: Is there something you'd like to talk about? "
"Martin: Oh, now, come on, guys. You don't have to pull everything apart. I said I'm fine, all right? Let's go. "
"Niles: All that effort, all that expense... How many minutes of joy did it buy? "
"Frasier: Oh dear God It's Stonehenge "
"Niles: Well, I hope it'll at least cheer dad up. The party certainly didn't. "
"Frasier: God, I know. Not even when Sherry sang that little ditty she'd composed; 'You Can Cop A Feel If I Can Feel A Cop' Brandy, Niles? "
"Niles: Please. "
"Niles: I tried to draw Dad out of the party, he just shot me right down. "
"Frasier: Well, you know how he is. Gets himself into these moods, he just retreats. "
"Niles: It's just so damn frustrating. How many wonders if that isn't why we go so insane every year, trying to find the perfect gift, as if somehow finding the right present will magically change everything. "
"Frasier: The thought occurred to me too. "
"Niles: You didn't mention it. "
"Frasier: It occurred to me. "
"Niles: So you say. "
"Frasier: Well, it... stop it "
"Sherry: Hiya, boys. Wow She's a beaut Oh, Marty and I are going to be spending a lot more time over here "
"Frasier: It's the gift that keeps on giving "
"Sherry: Well, where's your dad? "
"Frasier: He said he was coming home with you. "
"Sherry: Well, he told me that he was coming home with you. "
"Niles: Why would he do that? "
"Sherry: He was a little down at the party. Maybe he just wanted to go for a walk. "
"Frasier: I'm sure he's all right. He'll be back soon. "
"Niles: Still, it is rather late. I'll just go and look for him. "
"Frasier: Oh, suit yourself, Niles. I think you're fretting needlessly. "
"Sherry: Come on, let's fire this baby up. Do you like the Nashville Network? "
"Frasier: Oh, who am I kidding? I'm worried sick "
"Martin: Here you go. Hey, no offense, but your teeth look like hell I gotta tell you, the rest of you's not looking that much better either. Do you want me to give you a little rubdown, huh? Ah, that takes me back. Of course, your coat was a lot shinier in those days. Hell, so was mine. We were something, weren't we Agides, huh? Riding crowd control. People'd just step aside to let us pass. Now, they're putting you out to pasture and I'm riding the buses. It's fun getting old, isn't it? Hey, this is a nice place here, you know. I bet you're really going to like it here. "
"Martin: And you know, if you don't like it here, then we'll do what we said we would. We'll just go to Montana, start a ranch. You know, we still got all that money we took from those drug dealers buried in the old box canyon. "
"Frasier: All right, dad, we know you know we're here. "
"Martin: Well, why don't you get the hell out of here? "
"Niles: Dad... "
"Martin: Look, I just want to be alone with him, is that all right with you? "
"Frasier: All right, fine, we'll see you later. You know, it is a little troubling that you feel more comfortable talking to your horse than you do to your sons. "
"Niles: Actually, we might be able to help you with what you're going through; the ageing process... "
"Martin: Now, come on, now, stop it. You see, this is the problem. I know everything you're going to say. First of all, you'll start talking about sixty-five as being some sort of passage. And then you'll start spouting these theories and quoting Freud and who knows what else until by the time you get through analysing me, I'm going to be sixty-six Look, when I tell Agides something, you know what he does? Nothing. He just listens to me. "
"Niles: We listen. "
"Frasier: That's my slogan; 'I'm Listening.' You know, dad, listening is the foundation... "
"Frasier: Right. "
"Niles: Shush. "
"Frasier: Shush "
"Martin: When I saw Agides today, it was kinda of a shock to see how old he's gotten and I just... It made me realise how old I've gotten. "
"Frasier: Dad, you still have a lot of... "
"Martin: Now, come on... "
"Frasier: Sorry, sorry. "
"Martin: Look, it's not a problem you can solve, Frasier. It's just a fact of life. People get old. "
"Niles: Well, I guess this horse wasn't quite the banner gift I thought it would be. "
"Martin: Oh, yes, it was, Niles. I'm feeling a little bit sorry for myself right now, but I'll get over that. But I love this horse, it's the greatest present I've ever gotten. "
"Niles: Well, I'm glad, dad, but, you know, I think I may have misled you. The horse is from me and from Frasier. "
"Martin: Oh, Jeez, I'm sorry. Thanks a lot, Fras'. "
"Frasier: Well, actually, it was mostly Niles's idea. "
"Martin: Well, then, thanks to both of you. "
"Martin: It's just great. Well, come on, we ought to get going. Let's get a move on. "
"Frasier: Niles, what a generous gesture. How can I ever thank you? "
"Niles: Well... by calling your super and getting rid of that monstrosity in your apartment I do visit from time to time, you know. "

" The doorbell rings. Martin opens the door to Niles, "
"Niles: Trick or treat Or should I say, 'Pip Pip' "
"Martin: What's with the outfit? "
"Niles: This is part of your costume for tonight. I just picked it up for you. "
"Martin: What? I thought you said you were getting me a Sherlock Holmes outfit. He didn't wear a bowler. "
"Niles: Well, they were all out of Sherlock Holmes, so I put together something else for you. Don't worry, it's another detective. Tonight, you'll be Lord Peter Wimsey "
"Martin: Who the hell's that? "
"Niles: He's a celebrated bon vivant sleuth from a series of novels by Dorothy L. Sayers. "
"Martin: Well, I'm not going anywhere where I have to tell people my name's 'Wimsey' Ah no, forget it, I'm just gonna wear my old police uniform. "
"Niles: You can't. It's a Halloween ball for the Library Association, you have to come dressed as a character from literature. "
"Martin: Oh, why didn't I just tell Sherry I'd go with her to visit her mother in prison? "
"Niles: Come on, Dad, it'll be fun I'm going to go as Cyrano de Bergerac—musician, philosopher, fighter, poet [he grabs Martin's cane and brandishes it like a rapier] The greatest friend and the bravest swordsman alive Eew, what's all over your cane? "
"Martin: I don't know. I dropped it in the movie theater last night. "
"Frasier: I love this picture You look adorable in that "
"Daphne: Oh, I do not You just like it because you look so handsome in it. "
"Frasier: Well, the camera doesn't lie, you know. "
"Martin: What are you two giggling about? "
"Daphne: Oh, we're just looking at the snapshots from our trip to the microbrewery. "
"Niles: That must have been especially fun for you, Dad. [looks at some of the photos] You're not in any of these. "
"Martin: That's 'cause I didn't go. That was the day Eddie got into the poison oak. I was up all night rubbing calamine lotion on his belly. "
"Frasier: These really are the golden years for you, aren't they? "
"Niles: So it was just you and Frasier? "
"Daphne: Yes. Your brother and I got pretty silly after tasting all that beer. "
"Frasier: Now, now, Daphne there's no need to tell Niles everything we did that night. "
"Daphne: Yes, we got a bit naughty "
"Niles: Well, not too naughty, I hope. "
"Daphne: Oh, now, now, Dr. Crane, I know what you're thinking. But not to worry. After all that drinking, we didn't drive home. We spent the night in a motel. "
"Niles: Well, that takes a load off my mind. "
"Frasier: Well, Niles, uh, what time is this little soiree of yours this evening? "
"Martin: Yeah, I still got to get the velvet in my slippers re- crushed. "
"Niles: All right, Dad, I will find you a Sherlock Holmes outfit. Seven P.M. Which reminds me, I have to get home before Marta arrives to set up. She's arachnophobic, poor thing. Last Halloween she beat my centerpiece to bits with a broom. "
"Frasier: Well, perhaps we should go finish up those costumes, eh, waif? "
"Daphne: Yes "
"Niles: Did you say 'wife?' "
"Daphne: Hasn't your brother told you? Dr. Crane is going as Geoffrey Chaucer from 'The Canterbury Tales', and I'll be dressed as the Wife of Bath "
"Frasier: Yes, and a saucy little strumpet she is too "
"Daphne: Oh, you naughty rogue We've been having quite a time talking to each other like that. "
"Martin: Yeah, it's been Ye Olde Laugh Riot around here. "
"Daphne: Join me in my bedchamber, my lord? "
"Frasier: After you, my juicy wench "
"Niles: 'My juicy wench?' No, no, not you, Maris Wait, wait I hope you're happy, she's run for her water pills "
"Roz: On line three we have, uh, Ted, who is feeling a little disconnected. "
"Frasier: Go ahead, Ted. "
"Frasier: Well, I hope Ted appreciates irony. "
"Roz: On line two we have Bill. He's going through a very difficult transition. "
"Frasier: Hello, Bill. "
"Dorothy: Uh, hello? Is someone there? "
"Frasier: Well, I see we're pretty much through our transition, aren't we, Bill? "
"Dorothy: This is Dorothy. "
"Roz: Oh, Bill's on line one "
"Frasier: Yes, well, let's just stick with Dorothy for the time being. How can I help you? "
"Dorothy: You can get me Roz. I'm her manicurist, and she called for an appointment. "
"Roz: I'll call you back later, Dorothy. "
"Frasier: Perhaps we'd better take a moment to regroup. I'd like to apologize for the unusually high number of technical difficulties we've experienced today, and now we will go to these public service messages. "
"Frasier: Explain yourself "
"Roz: I'm just a little off my game today. "
"Frasier: A little? "
"Roz: O.K., a lot. "
"Frasier: Roz, you come in here looking ghoulish even for Halloween, and you sleepwalk your way through my entire show "
"Roz: Oh... I'm sorry, Frasier. "
"Frasier: 'Sorry' just doesn't cut it, Roz What possible explanation can there be for this level of unprofessionalism? "
"Roz: I think I'm pregnant. "
"Frasier: Pregnant? "
"Roz: Well, I don't know for sure. I took one of those home tests, and it was kind of iffy, so I went to see my doctor, and he's gonna call me with results. "
"Frasier: But, Roz, how—? "
"Roz: I don't know how No one is more careful than I am when it comes to birth control. But then again, even the best protection is only effective ninety-nine out of a hundred times. I can't beat those odds. "
"Frasier: Yes, I suppose you've been dodging that bullet for a long time now. "
"Roz: Frasier, promise me you won't tell anyone. "
"Frasier: Oh, of course not, Roz. But frankly, we don't know if we have anything to tell yet. "
"Roz: What if there is? "
"Frasier: Then we'll deal with that when we have to. No use crossing that bridge till we come to it. "
"Roz: I can't get my mind off it "
"Frasier: Well, you know Niles's party is tonight. That should serve as a distraction. "
"Roz: Oh, Frasier, I don't think I'm up for that. "
"Frasier: Oh, come on, Roz "
"Roz: Well, I did rent a costume and everything. "
"Frasier: For me? It'll be fun You know you want to. "
"Roz: That's exactly the kind of talk that got me into this. "
"Bulldog: Hey, tell your brother I'm coming to his charity thing tonight. I just found the perfect costume "
"Frasier: And as what literary character will you be attending? "
"Bulldog: Waldo From 'Where's Waldo?' He's like in sixteen books You call yourself well-read. "
"Niles: Niles Crane. Maris Where are you? Still at the beauty parlor? What—no, calm down, calm down, stop crying. It can't be as bad as all that. Exactly how much hair do you have left? Oh... "
"Niles: Well, don't panic, we just have to find another character for you to be tonight. Uh, there's an Ionesco play called 'The Bald Soprano' No I'm joking, Maris. What? You've got to come Maris, for God's sake, you have thirty-seven wigs, just go down to the wig vault and pick one Maris, this evening means a great deal to me. I need you here with me. Do you care about my feelings at all? Well, that answers that. "
"Frasier: So, how's the party? "
"Daphne: Actually, we just got here. We had a bit of a delay when Sherlock here led us to the wrong apartment. "
"Martin: Oh, so we're a minute late. I noticed you didn't complain when the old lady gave us peanut butter cups. "
"Niles: Evening, all Oh, what lovely costumes Daphne, you look particularly beautiful. "
"Daphne: Oh, thanks. I'm not sure I agree. It's a bit tight—must have put on a pound or two. "
"Frasier: That's enough out of you, you wanton troll, or I'll smite your bawdy backside with the flat of me sinewy right hand "
"Martin: At least on the ride over her I could stick my head out the window. So where's the bar? "
"Niles: That's right over here, I'm serving grog and mead. "
"Martin: Which one tastes most like beer? "
"Frasier: Oh, Roz Oh, I'm so glad you came Any word from the doctor? "
"Roz: No, and I am going crazy. I can't even picture myself as a mother, can you? "
"Frasier: Well, I don't think discipline will be a problem. "
"Daphne: Wow, Roz, don't you look smashing "
"Eve: What an interesting costume Who are you? "
"Roz: I'm 'O', from 'The Story of 'O''. "
"Guests: Oh . . . "
"Roz: It's gonna be a long night. "
"Daphne: Well, I think you look particularly lovely tonight. There's a real glow about you. "
"Roz: Oh no Oh God, not a glow I'm sorry, I'm just a little jumpy. I had... kind of an accident, and I just haven't found out what the damage is yet. Actually, I need to check my machine. Do you know where a phone is? "
"Daphne: Yeah, there's one at the top of the stairs. "
"Roz: Thank you. "
"Daphne: Try not to worry. A few years back, I got rear-ended. Is that what happened to you? "
"Roz: Not exactly. "
"Guy: Oh, hello. "
"Roz: Hi. "
"Guy: Are you here alone? "
"Roz: Oh God, I hope so. "
"Gil: Oh my What a delectable medley of frommagian splendor You must try one. "
"Martin: Mmm, cheesy. "
"Gil: Mmm, yes. 'Cheesy'—the mot juste. It must be glorious to have such a happy knack for clarity and concision. "
"Martin: Yep. So who're you suppose to be? "
"Gil: Chingatchkook — I'm the Last of the Mohicans "
"Martin: Oh Well... that little mystery solved. "
"to: A While Later "
"Frasier: Daphne, have you seen Roz? "
"Daphne: Probably on the phone. Seems like every fifteen minutes she's calling her machine again. This little accident's got her pretty worried. "
"Frasier: She told you about it? "
"Niles: Champagne? "
"Frasier: Oh, not now, Niles. Excuse us, we need a moment alone. "
"Daphne: Roz told me all about it. It's no big deal. Accidents happen even when you're being careful. I had one myself a few years back. "
"Frasier: Oh, Daphne, really? "
"Daphne: Yeah. It was one of those real wham-bam numbers. He was drunk and I wasn't paying attention... "
"Frasier: Oh... "
"Daphne: I called and called, but never got a penny out of him. "
"Frasier: I had no idea. "
"Daphne: Oh, it's not that bad. For goodness' sake, back in Manchester, what with all those drunken louts out and about, it must have happened to me at least a dozen times. "
"Frasier: Really? I had no... really? Well, of course nothing's certain until we get the pregnancy test results. "
"Daphne: Pregnancy? We're not talking about a car accident, are we? "
"Frasier: Oh dear. "
"Daphne: Roz is pregnant? "
"Frasier: Absolutely not Where could you get such an insane notion? "
"Daphne: Well, you just said she was "
"Frasier: Shut up Or I'll smite you with the back of me sinewy — oh, just get in here "
"Niles: Did you notice where Frasier went? "
"Martin: No idea. "
"Niles: What about Daphne? "
"Martin: Haven't a clue. "
"Niles: Holmes, you astound me. "
"Frasier: Oh, I feel so guilty. Roz swore me to secrecy. I never should have said anything. "
"Daphne: It's not your fault, you thought I knew. Do you have a tissue? These silly lashes are killing my eyes. I must be allergic to the adhesive. "
"Frasier: Just promise me you won't tell a soul. We've got to keep this secret. "
"Daphne: Oh, right But we can't keep it a secret forever. My God, we are talking about a baby. "
"Frasier: Oh, how could I have been so careless? "
"Daphne: These things happen, it's not your fault. "
"Frasier: Yes, well, you know who'll get the blame if this ever gets out "
"Daphne: Don't worry, I'll protect your reputation. I'll tell everyone I forced you to it. "
"Frasier: All right. We'd better get back to the party before people start wondering about us. "
"Frasier: Oh, hello, Niles. What's your nose all bent out of shape about? "
"Frasier: Well, there's a literary 'figure' I'd like to know better. "
"Niles: Just a moment, I need a word with you. "
"Frasier: What about? "
"Niles: Stay there, I've guests to greet. "
"Kids: Trick or treat "
"Niles: How did you get past the doorman? "
"Dracula: We live in the building. "
"Niles: Well, I'm sorry, this isn't a good night for this. "
"Dracula: But it's Halloween "
"Niles: Uh Very well Crab puff for you, and some gravlax for you, and pate for Dracula. Now off you go "
"Niles: I need to talk to you "
"Frasier: Not now, Niles Let me guess... Lady Godiva? "
"Eve: No, Eve — from the Bible. "
"Frasier: Well, now I know why they call it 'The Good Book.' "
"Niles: What are you doing? Are you just going to abandon Daphne? "
"Frasier: Niles, just because I gave her a ride doesn't mean I have to spend the whole evening with her "
"Bulldog: Hey Hey, get a load of that schnozzola "
"Bulldog: No, wait, wait Guess who I am? "
"Niles: I give up. "
"Bulldog: I'm Waldo From 'Where's Waldo?' You know, that guy you can't find because he blends into the crowd? "
"Niles: I don't know, but I'd love a demonstration. "
"Frasier: And to think, all that time your cat was curled up in your sock drawer. They're almost human, aren't they? "
"Niles: Pardon me, I need a word alone with my brother. "
"Frasier: Not now, Niles I'm doing really well here. This pointy hat is a babe magnet "
"Niles: It's urgent "
"Frasier: Just keep your voice down I'm sorry, will you excuse me? "
"Eve: Sure, but hurry back. "
"Niles: Your boorish behavior is simply appalling I can no longer hold my tongue "
"Frasier: Replace 'tongue' with 'liquor,' and I'll believe you You're drunk, Niles "
"Niles: Drunk like a fox I know about the baby. "
"Frasier: You do? "
"Niles: Yes "
"Frasier: Who told you? "
"Niles: I heard it from Daphne's own lips "
"Frasier: Daphne That blabbermouth I'll wring her neck "
"Niles: Listen to yourself Have you no conscience? "
"Frasier: Niles, you're getting awfully exercised about this. "
"Niles: We're talking about a single woman with a baby What do you intend to do about it? "
"Frasier: Well, I suppose I could give her a raise "
"Niles: That's your idea of responsibility? Give her a raise? "
"Frasier: Well, what do you want me to do, marry her? Let's look at something here, buddy, she's the one that got pregnant Hello, Roz. "
"Roz: Beat it, Niles "
"Niles: Stay here "
"Roz: I am so mad at you I could scream How could you tell Niles about the baby? "
"Frasier: I didn't Daphne told him, the damnable chatterbox "
"Roz: And who told Daphne? "
"Frasier: Well... that would be me "
"Niles: Ah What is it with all you children, isn't it past your bedtime? "
"Krovitz: Dr. Crane, it's me, Dr. Krovitz. "
"Niles: Of course it is, and this must be your lovely wife Sylvia. "
"Krovitz: I don't know her. "
"Alice: Trick or treat "
"Roz: What is wrong with you? I specifically asked you not to tell anyone. "
"Frasier: I'm sorry, Roz, but the way she spoke it sounded as if she already knew you were having a baby "
"Martin: What, you are? "
"Roz: Oh, great Nice going, Frasier. "
"Frasier: Well, I'm sorry, Roz, but he is the Master of Deduction He would have figured it out anyway "
"Niles: Just let it out. I'm here for you. "
"Daphne: I keep telling you, I'm not crying. It's my damn lashes. "
"Niles: As courageous as you are beautiful. Oh, you shouldn't be drinking this poison [takes her champagne glass, then notices Roz] Here, Roz, drink this. "
"Daphne: Roz, do you have a tissue? "
"Roz: If you don't see it, I don't have it I'm sorry. Do you want to go get a cocktail napkin? "
"Niles: Hurry back, brave girl Oh, just look at her, poor thing. "
"Martin: What are you talking about? "
"Niles: Oh, I suppose you'll find out soon enough. There's a baby on the way. "
"Martin: Oh, you know about that too? "
"Niles: Who told you? "
"Martin: Well, I heard Frasier and Roz talking about it. "
"Niles: You don't seem very surprised. "
"Martin: Well, I mean I'm fond of her. But let's face it, she's no Sunday school teacher. She's been around the block a few times "
"Niles: Well, instead of heaping scorn on her, you might put the blame where it belongs, on Frasier Look at him, the shameless Casanova "
"Martin: What's Frasier got to do with this? "
"Niles: He's the father "
"Martin: What? Are you kidding me? "
"Frasier: Well, I heard it from his own mouth "
"Martin: Well, I don't believe it I've got to go talk to him "
"Niles: Wait, wait I've just made a montentous decision There's one person in this family who still has a sense of honor and decency. Frasier may not be able to do right by that woman, but I will "
"Martin: What are you talking about? "
"Niles: I'm going to propose to her. "
"Martin: Are you nuts? You're still married. "
"Niles: Maris never needed me. But there's a woman here who does. "
"Martin: Boy, I didn't know you even liked her. "
"Niles: Yes, I wore that mask well. But now it's time to do the honorable thing "
"Martin: Oh, you mean divorce your wife and marry the woman who's carrying your brother's child? "
"Niles: I've made up my mind. Nothing's going to stop me, Dad "
"Gil: Uh, excuse me, Niles. I'm afraid there's been a bit of an hors d'oeuvre mishap on your Persian rug. Just call me 'Fumbles With Crab Puffs.' "
"Niles: Not now, Gil. "
"Daphne: There's no use fretting until you know for sure. God, my eyes are just getting worse. I suppose I should ask Dr. Crane to take me home. But I feel bad ruining his good time. I was having fun too—there are some very attractive men here "
"say: "
"Daphne: But who's going to want me in this condition? "
"Roz: Oh, don't worry about Frasier. He'll take care of you. "
"Niles: That's a laugh Beat it, Roz. "
"Daphne: Dr. Crane "
"Roz: Never mind, I got to go check my machine. "
"Niles: Daphne, we've known each other for four years now, so I want to take the time to phrase this just right. "
"Daphne: Yeah, well, you take all the time you need. I have to go find your brother. "
"Daphne: Dr. Crane, can I talk to you for a second? "
"Frasier: I'm sorry, will you excuse me? "
"Eve: It's all right. I'll go freshen my lipstick. I feel naked without it. "
"Frasier: Haven't you ruined my evening enough already? "
"Daphne: What are you talking about? "
"Frasier: I am talking about you and your blabbermouth Niles told me you told him about the baby "
"Daphne: I did not "
"Frasier: Oh, don't play innocent with me "
"Daphne: Look, I don't mean to ruin your evening, but I can't stay at the party like this. Look at my eyes "
"Frasier: Oh well, I am dreadfully sorry for your condition, Daphne, but it's your own fault You should have read the directions on the package before you used it "
"Daphne: I don't know why you're blaming this whole mess on me I just know I need a lift home right now "
"Frasier: Oh, all right But I am not leaving here until I get Eve's phone number. So you can just sit down, have a drink, smoke a cigarette if you like I'm sorry, I am very attracted to this young woman, and I am not going to let you and your little problem stand in my way "
"Niles: THAT'S ENOUGH "
"Frasier: Niles, get your big nose out of this And lower your voice, you're embarrassing yourself "
"Niles: The only thing I'm embarrassed about is that you're my brother You cad, you bounder, you roué "
"Frasier: What is so wrong about trying to get a woman's phone number? "
"Niles: We're not interested in your next conquest, we're talking about your last one And before you deny it, I have plenty of proof "
"Frasier: From here, it smells like eighty proof "
"Niles: A woman stands here before you in dire need... "
"Daphne: It's really not that bad. I can find someone else who'll take me. "
"Niles: Indeed you can. "
"Martin: Niles— "
"Niles: I told you, don't try to stop me You have the audacity to seduce this poor woman, and then you aren't man enough to stand by her? "
"Frasier: Niles, before you make a complete ass of yourself— "
"Niles: Stop, or I'll teach you a long overdue lesson in chivalry "
"Daphne: But, Dr. Crane— "
"Niles: No, no No, don't defend him [takes off his hat and kneels in front of Daphne, taking her hand] There may be one bastard in this family, but as long as I have anything to say about it, your baby won't be another. Daphne... will you marry me? "
"Frasier: Oh, for God's sake, you drunken imbecile Daphne's not the one that's pregnant, Roz is "
"Niles: Roz is? "
"Eve: Who's Roz? "
"Bulldog: She's the one dressed like 'O.' "
"Guests: Oh... "
"Daphne: That was very gallant, Dr. Crane. Perhaps you should propose to Roz. "
"Martin: If anybody's gonna propose to Roz, it's Frasier "
"Frasier: What? "
"Martin: How could you do that? Get her pregnant? "
"Gil: It was Frasier? "
"Frasier: No Listen, everybody, I am not the father of Roz's baby "
"Frasier: In fact, we don't even know for sure if there IS a baby "
"Roz: We do now.

" "
"Frasier: Oh, Roz... how are you? "
"Roz: Still pregnant. "
"Frasier: Look, I-I'm sorry about last night. I tried to apologize, but you ran out of the party so fast. "
"Roz: Oh, I'm sorry Was that rude? You know more about etiquette that I do. What is the proper length of time you should stay after someone announces to a hundred strangers that you got knocked up? "
"Frasier: I tried to call. "
"Roz: I know, I wasn't answering. I was up all night thinking about what I want to do. "
"Frasier: Yes, I suppose a decision of that magnitude would take many sleepless— "
"Roz: I'm having the baby. "
"Frasier: -hours to make. Are you sure, Roz? "
"Roz: I know it seems quick. But even when I was hoping I wasn't pregnant, I knew if I was, I was keeping the baby. "
"Frasier: Well, then let me be the first to congratulate you "
"Roz: Oh, thanks. "
"Frasier: Oh, Roz, oh God, that's so wonderful You're gonna make a great mom "
"Roz: Well, I did the first part pretty well, and I wasn't even trying. "
"Frasier: So, have you told the father? "
"Roz: Yes, I called him at nine o'clock this morning, which was seven o'clock at night, Cairo time. "
"Frasier: Is that a pertinent fact, or are you just trying to impress me with your mastery of time zones? "
"Roz: I mean he moved to Cairo, working on a project. He's an architect. "
"Frasier: Oh. Well, when's he coming back? "
"Roz: He isn't. But that's perfectly fine with me. I'm perfectly comfortable raising this baby by myself. "
"Frasier: And... I'm sure everyone around here will give you plenty of support. "
"Bulldog: So, Roz, who's the proud papa? You got it narrowed down yet? "
"Roz: That's nice, very nice. Frasier, will you excuse us? "
"Frasier: Yes, of course. Just remember the baby's future, Roz. Try to make it look like an accident. "
"Bulldog: Look, I was just kidding. I'm sure you probably know who the dad is. "
"Roz: Well, that's what I wanted to talk to you about. Do you remember Janet's party a couple months ago? You got really drunk and I drove you home? "
"Bulldog: Yeah... what about it? "
"Roz: Well, you invited me up, and I guess I'd had a few myself, because the next thing I knew— "
"Bulldog: No, whoa — I don't believe this. I don't even remember us— "
"Roz: Now calm down, Bulldog— "
"Bulldog: No, come on, please, just tell me you're joking. "
"Roz: Look, we don't have to get married right away— "
"Bulldog: Oh, man Oh, man "
"Roz: I thought you'd be happy about this. I mean, we were wonderful together. When you made love to me, you were so tender and caring— "
"Bulldog: Hey, whoa Ha, ha 'Tender and caring?' No way was that me Yeah, you almost had me Good one, Roz. "
"Martin: Someone at the door "
"Daphne: Really? So that's what that funny chiming sound means. I'm a little indisposed here, would you mind? "
"Martin: Oh sure, sorry, Daph. Hang on, she's coming "
"Daphne: You take it easy, rest up for that big trek to the dinner table. "
"Daphne: Hello, Dr. Crane. "
"Niles: Daphne, before I even come in, I just have to say I am mortified by my behavior last night. Honestly, I don't know what got into me. "
"Martin: About a quart of vodka, for starters. "
"Daphne: There's no need for an apology. I thought what you did was very chivalrous. "
"Niles: Well, I happen to believe that if a woman finds herself in such a predicament, a man of honor has an obligation to step forward and do the right thing. "
"Daphne: Now poor Roz really is in that predicament. "
"Niles: Do I smell chicken? "
"Frasier: Yes, Niles. We'll be serving dinner just as soon as Roz gets here. I didn't think she should be alone this evening. "
"Daphne: How's she doing? "
"Frasier: Oh, O.K., I guess, considering she's decided to have the baby by herself. "
"Martin: Boy, things have really changed since my day. Back then, if a girl got in trouble, her family would send her away to relatives in another state, and if anybody asked, just lied and said she went to Europe. Then when she came back, they'd raise the baby as a little sister. Not like today — we had morals and values back then. "
"Niles: I always assumed I'd have children, but if Maris and I don't reconcile soon, the issue will be moot. She's a tad older than I am, and her biological clock is winding down. "
"Frasier: Luckily, she flies to Zurich twice a year to have it reset. "
"Daphne: Babies are wonderful, but Roz does have a tough road ahead of her. "
"Niles: It can never be easy balancing a career with motherhood. "
"Martin: Well, the big question is where's she going to find a husband? I mean, a little kid needs a mother and a father. "
"Frasier: That's Roz Just remember, she came here tonight to have a quiet little evening, not to be reminded of the difficult situation she's in. We'll just take our cue from her. If she doesn't bring it up, we won't discuss it Agreed? "
"Frasier: Daphne, you may answer the door. "
"Daphne: Well, thank you Why don't I just get a feather duster and a French maid's uniform? "
"Niles: That would teach them, wouldn't it, Daphne, and I would pick it out for you "
"Daphne: Hello, Roz. "
"Roz: Hi. "
"Frasier: Dinner's almost ready, make yourself comfortable. "
"Roz: Thanks. "
"Daphne: So... that's such a cute skirt. "
"Roz: I just got it. "
"Martin: I just got these pants. "
"Roz: They're nice. "
"Roz: I got some interesting news Well, last night, I — and a large portion of Seattle — found out I was pregnant Don't you guys want to ask me about it? "
"Daphne: Sure, we all do But we were told not to. "
"Martin: Yeah, Frasier's afraid we might say something to make you uncomfortable. "
"Roz: Oh, that's silly. I want to talk about it. I'm really excited, I'm going to be a mom I've got a lot to do. I'll tell you one thing I'm gonna need, pronto— "
"Martin: A husband "
"Roz: I was going to say a bigger apartment. "
"Martin: Oh. Well, maybe the husband'll have one. "
"Daphne: So, how did the father take it? Don't worry, she brought it up "
"Roz: He actually took it really well. He's not going to be that involved, though. He moved to Cairo. "
"Niles: Where would he have moved to if he'd taken it badly? "
"Roz: No, he's working in Cairo on a project, he's an archaeologist. "
"Daphne: Oh. "
"Frasier: Roz, can I get you a drink? "
"Roz: O.K., do you have any mineral water? "
"Frasier: Yes, I have eight different kinds. Why don't you come into the kitchen and pick one? "
"Martin: Yeah, he's got room for eight different kinds of water in that fridge, and I have to keep my can of spray cheese under the sink. "
"Frasier: You know, this morning you told me the father was an architect. "
"Roz: I did? Oh, that was a slip of the tongue. "
"Frasier: Ah. And, uh, how did you two meet again? "
"Roz: In a bar. "
"Frasier: This morning you told me it was on a double-date. "
"Roz: Oh, that's right, it was It was on a double-date. "
"Frasier: This morning you told me nothing What is going on, Roz, you're obviously hiding something. [Niles comes in] Niles, please, would you excuse us? "
"Niles: Oh, by all means. I just came in to open a bottle of wine. "
"Frasier: All right, what's going on? Is it that you don't know who the father is? "
"Roz: Of course I know "
"Frasier: Well, then why don't you tell me? "
"Roz: I haven't even told him yet. "
"Frasier: Oh? "
"Roz: And I'm not sure I'm going to tell him. It's a little complicated— "
"Frasier: Look, Roz, I don't care who the father is. The man has a right to know that he's going to have a child. "
"Roz: Frasier, this really isn't any of your business. "
"Frasier: Yes, well, it's certainly his business. You have an obligation to let this man know that you're having his baby Niles, do you mind? It's impossible to have a conversation here with you constantly eavesdropping. "
"Niles: I don't know what you two are talking about, but I resent the implication that I have nothing better to do than to spy on you like a nosy teenager. I came in for a corkscrew. "
"Frasier: Oh Niles, I-I'm sorry— "
"room:] "
"Niles: All I could get was that she hasn't told the father yet. "
"Frasier: Double latte, please. "
"Rick: Coming right up. I'll bring it to your table. "
"Frasier: Thank you. "
"Frasier: Morning, Roz "
"Roz: Frasier? What are you doing here? "
"Frasier: Oh, I realize it must be a shock to see me here in this place I come to every day of my life. "
"Roz: You had a dental appointment "
"Frasier: Well, I rescheduled it for tomorrow. "
"Roz: Thanks for telling me "
"Frasier: What's going on? "
"Roz: All right, I came here to talk to him — the father, yes. "
"Frasier: Really? Well, I'm proud of you "
"Roz: Well, thank you very much, now get out of here "
"Frasier: All right, just wait one second. Excuse me, may I have that to go, please? "
"Rick: Oh sure, Dr. Crane. "
"Frasier: Thank you. "
"Rick: Hey, Roz How you doing? "
"Roz: Fine, thanks. "
"Rick: Well, what can I get you? "
"Roz: Uh, I'll have a decaf. "
"Rick: Be right back. "
"Frasier: He's a nice kid, Rick. "
"Roz: Yes, he is. "
"Frasier: Working here to put himself through school, right? "
"Roz: Yes, he is. "
"Frasier: He's the father, isn't he? "
"Roz: Yes, he is. "
"Frasier: The father of your child is a teenager "
"Roz: Well, of course he is not a teenager anymore He had a birthday three weeks ago Look, uh, you know, we just went out for a couple of weeks, and then it was over, there were no hard feelings. It is a little embarrassing, though, him being seven years younger than I am— oh, put your eyebrows down I've seen your driver's license, and you don't weigh no 'One-Seventy' Now you know what I'm talking about. I don't want to ruin his whole life. "
"Frasier: He still has a right to know. "
"Roz: I know that. But it's not gonna be easy. When you were a junior in college, if a woman came to you and told you she was carrying your child, wouldn't you have been devastated? "
"Frasier: In my case, I would have been mystified. "
"Roz: How do I even begin to tell him? "
"Frasier: Yes, something like that is never easy. "
"Rick: So, Roz, what made you switch to decaf? "
"Frasier: Then again, sometimes a natural opening does present itself. "
"Roz: I'm just trying to stay healthy. Listen, Rick, I've been trying to call you, but your number wasn't working. "
"Rick: Oh yeah, I'm not in the dorms anymore. "
"Roz: Oh, you got your own place? "
"Rick: No, I moved back in with my parents. "
"Roz: Frasier, isn't that your dad over there waving to you? "
"Frasier: Oh yes, of course. My dad is over there waving to me. Oh look — my dad's over there waving to me "
"Rick: So, you look incredible. "
"Roz: Thanks. "
"table:] "
"Frasier: Dad, what are you doing here? "
"Martin: Oh, Sherry took her sister to that store across the street to buy some foundation garments. "
"Frasier: I think they call them 'bras' now. "
"Martin: Not these, you don't. You could cross the River Kwai on one of those babies. "
"table:] "
"Roz: So, I have some news for you— "
"Rick: Oh, I've got some news too You remember I was telling you about that Junior Year Abroad Program? I'm in I leave next fall and I will be spending the rest of the year in Paris "
"Roz: Oh, I'm so happy for you "
"Rick: Yeah, I'm thinking, first my soccer team wins the championship, then I ace my finals, now I'm going to Paris I'm wondering, 'What next' "
"Roz: Funny you should ask... "
"Martin: I'm telling you, there's something in my eye "
"Frasier: I don't see anything. "
"Martin: Are you sure? "
"Frasier: I don't see anything "
"Martin: Well, you're not even looking "
"Frasier: Well then, here, let me— "
"Martin: No, don't touch Don't touch "
"Frasier: Listen, Dad, I've got to go talk to Roz, just go into the bathroom and wash it out with cold water. "
"Martin: Oh, yeah, I'm sure glad I worked all those extra shifts to put you through medical school, it really paid off "
"Frasier: Roz? "
"Roz: Don't worry, I told him. "
"Frasier: How'd he take it? "
"Roz: Well, he was pretty freaked out, actually. But I assured him that I didn't need anything from him, and I was going to raise the baby by myself. Anyway, he's gonna be fine. Oh my God, I'm late for a doctor's appointment. "
"Frasier: Are you gonna be all right? "
"Roz: Yeah. "
"Frasier: Can I take you to dinner tonight? "
"Roz: Oh, thank you, Frasier, that would be nice. "
"Frasier: O.K. "
"Martin: Boy, I can't stand these yuppie joints. Some bozo went through the men's room, correcting all the grammar in the graffiti with a red pen. "
"Frasier: Yes, I noticed. "
"Martin: I mean, who'd have that much time on his hands? "
"Frasier: Unbelievable. "
"Martin: It was Niles, wasn't it? "
"Frasier: I'll talk to him again. "
"Roz: It's open, Frasier. "
"Rick: Hi. I'm sorry, I probably should have called first— "
"Roz: No, it's all right I'm just kind of surprised to see you here. "
"Rick: I'm kind of surprised to be here. Oh, these are for you. "
"Roz: Thank you. "
"Rick: There was a card, too, but it kind of blew off on the way over here. I rode my bike. "
"Rick: I acted like an idiot today. "
"Roz: It's O.K.— "
"Rick: No, it's not I mean, when you told me, all I could think about was myslef and how it was going to affect me. Then I started thinking about you, and the, uh... "
"Roz: The baby. "
"Rick: Right. That's the other reason I'm here. I'm not going to Paris. I'm not going anywhere. I'm quitting school, and I'm going to work at the Café full time "
"Roz: So you've come to tell me you've lost your mind. "
"Rick: No. I came here to ask you to marry me. "
"Roz: Oh, Rick... that's so... wrong. "
"Rick: Oh yeah, that's right Roz, will you marry me? "
"Roz: No, no The proposal was fine, it was lovely. "
"Rick: Listen, I have been thinking about this all afternoon. I could fall in love with you. I could be a good husband, and a good father. "
"Roz: Rick, that's the whole point of being twenty. You could be anything. I'm much older than you, I am things. "
"Rick: I'm not too young for this You know, my mom was only seventeen when she had me. "
"Roz: Your mother's only thirty-seven? "
"Rick: Yeah. And, boy, would you two hit if off I mean, you have a lot in common. In fact, you sort of even look like— "
"Roz: Stop right there Listen, your proposal was so sweet. It's my first, actually. "
"Rick: Yeah, mine too. "
"Roz: Oh... I hope that you can understand why I can't possibly marry you. When I get married, it's going to be to someone I love, and to someone who loves me, and someone who can legally drink champagne at my wedding "
"Rick: O.K. I understand. So, is this—? "
"Roz: Yeah, it's the sonogram picture. It came this morning. [shows him] Right there. "
"Rick: Wow... that dot's my kid. "
"Roz: No, that dot's just a dot. That dot's your kid. You can have it. And I could send you photos, updates, that sort of thing? "
"Rick: I would like that. Thank you. Roz, are you sure—? "
"Roz: Yeah, I am. I think this is the right thing, for you and for me. Now go. Go to Paris Go learn, go have fun Just don't come back wearing a beret "
"Rick: O.K. Take care of yourself. "
"Roz: You too. "
"Roz: I said go "
"Frasier: But I just got here "
"Roz: I'm sorry, Frasier, come in "
"Frasier: I ran into Rick in the hall. "
"Roz: Yeah. He asked me to marry him. I said no. "
"Frasier: Well, that was very sweet of him. "
"Roz: Oh, I was just making some tea, do you want some? "
"Frasier: Yeah, sure, thanks. With milk, please. [she goes to the kitchen] Well, you've had quite a day, haven't you? You all right? "
"Roz: I'm fine. "
"Frasier: You know, it's O.K. to not be fine. "
"Roz: Is it O.K. just to be O.K.? "
"Frasier: Yeah, sure. "
"Frasier: Thanks, Roz. Oh, oh, this milk's expired. "
"Roz: Oh. Whoa, it has. "
"Frasier: It's O.K., I can drink the tea straight. "
"Roz: I had no idea I let this milk expire. "
"Frasier: It's really all right, Roz. "
"Roz: I can't take this. Damn it, how could I let this happen? "
"Frasier: Are we still talking about the milk? "
"Roz: Don't you see? Milk is a staple I let a staple go bad Good mothers don't let staples go bad How can I be responsible for a child when I can't even keep fresh milk in the house? Kids need milk "
"Frasier: Roz, if it helps, kids don't even drink milk for the first year. "
"Roz: Oh, see? I didn't even know that "
"Frasier: I didn't know that either until I was a parent. "
"Roz: Don't you understand? I have to know everything. You can know half of everything. You can know about the milk, and Lilith can know about the booties and the snugglies— "
"Frasier: You never met Lilith, did you? "
"Frasier: Just forget the milk, and forget the tea. Talk to me. "
"Roz: I don't even know where to start. Everything in my life is about to change. My body, my love life... "
"Frasier: Yes, but it's also going to change in fantastic ways. I remember the first night I brought Frederick home from the hospital. You put this tiny thing into a tiny little bed, and you look around and you realize that the entire house has changed. "
"Roz: I know. I want that. But, God, the responsibility... "
"Frasier: Well, yes. But it's all worth it. You get to share your life with a remarkable little creature... who only lives in the present, runs around naked without the slightest bit of shame, and can entertain himself for hours just staring at a shiny object. Isn't that wonderful? "
"Roz: Isn't that Bulldog? "
"Frasier: Well, technically, yes. Roz, I'm going to tell you something I didn't find out until I became a father. You don't just love your children... you fall in love with them. "
"Roz: Oh my God... I'm gonna have a baby. Someone is gonna cry out for 'Mom' and it's gonna be me I'm really scared. What if I can't do this by myself? "
"Frasier: But, Roz, you're not all by yourself. I'm here. "
"Roz: Oh, thank you, Frasier. "
"Frasier: And I'll be available for you whenever you wish, from taking you out to dinner tonight, to that moment in the delivery room when you say, 'Welcome to the world little Jimmy,' or 'little Sally,' or... dare I hope 'little Frasier?' "
"Roz: Oh my God, I think I'm gonna be sick. "
"Frasier: I guess I got a little carried away there. "
"Roz: No, I mean I'm gonna hurl "
"Frasier: Oh dear God "

"Waiter: Hey, how're you doing, doc? The usual? "
"Frasier: Please. "
"Niles: I'll have my usual, too. "
"Waiter: And that would be...? "
"Niles: Ah I come here every day. You must remember... my usual is... a half-caf... cappuccino... with a light dusting of... "
"Waiter: Nutmeg. "
"Niles: Cinnamon God, that's infuriating "
"Frasier: Oh, Niles. "
"Niles: I come in here every bit as often as you do. "
"Frasier: Don't take it to heart, Niles. This person just happened to remember me best, the next person might just as easily... "
"Woman: Oh my God, you're Frasier Crane. Could I bother you for an autograph? "
"Frasier: No, you can't. "
"Woman: I love your show. "
"Frasier: Oh, thank you. "
"Woman: I just think you're like the smartest guy on the face of the earth. "
"Frasier: Well, one does hear tales of a certain wise man in Tibet, but why split hairs? There you go. "
"Woman: Thanks. "
"Frasier: Where was I? "
"Niles: You were last seen hiking up Mount Ego "
"Martin: Shut up already You've been yakking about this all morning. "
"Daphne: Well, it's a stupid rule and it's always we foreigners that suffer for it. "
"Frasier: Began driving on the wrong side of the road today, did we? "
"Daphne: No It's about my friend, Xena... oh, you don't want to hear about it. "
"Niles: Xena, isn't she the Greek one? "
"Daphne: Yeah, we've been planning a trip together. You see, her mother's taking a luxury cruise and her ship will be docked in Mazatlan for a week, she invited us down to join her. Only I can't go because my bloody passport's expired. "
"Niles: Still, don't give up, one way or another we'll get you across that border. If I have to, I'll snuggle you under an old blanket "
"Daphne: Don't you mean smuggle? "
"Niles: I'm using code language, you can't be too careful "
"Waiter: There you go, Doc. Anything for you, ma'am? "
"Daphne: Oh, thanks, I've already ordered. "
"Waiter: Oh, I'm sorry, you had the... "
"Niles: Absent-minded waiter, I'll get it myself "
"Daphne: Oh, Roz called. She wanted me to remind you about your meeting with the station manager. "
"Frasier: Ah, yes, that, he probably wants to discuss my one-thousandth radio broadcast that's coming up next week. "
"Martin: You've done a thousand shows? "
"Frasier: Yes, and if I know the station manager, he'll want to mark the occasion with some sort of gaudy celebration. Press parties and God knows what No, I don't really kind of go in for that sort of self-congratulatory hoopla The work is the thing for me "
"Daphne: But still, a thousand shows That's quite an achievement. "
"Frasier: Yeah, I suppose, who'd have thought? "
"Martin: Not me, that's for damn sure. Yeah, those first two weeks. Peeuw Open a window "
"Frasier: All right, dad "
"Bulldog: Hey, morning, Roz. "
"Roz: Morning, Bulldog. "
"Roz: Oh, my gosh, look what Frasier got for me. It's so cute 'Dear Roz, a huggy bear for the mom to be. Love, Bulldog'? "
"Bulldog: I guess I should have known you'd think it was from Frasier. "
"Roz: I'm so sorry, Bulldog. "
"Bulldog: No, no, it's okay. I know I'm not the warmest guy in the world, but when it comes to kids I get kinda, well, you know... "
"Roz: Oh Bulldog, come here. Come here. "
"Bulldog: Oh, you're going to make a good mother, Roz. "
"Roz: Thank you, Bulldog, that's sweet. "
"Roz: Bulldog? "
"Roz: Oh, get off me You just wanted to hug me because my breasts are getting bigger. "
"Bulldog: No, I was just trying to get close enough to feel a little kick. "
"Roz: Get out Pervert "
"Frasier: Morning, Roz. I got you one of those little muffins that you love. "
"Roz: You're not getting a hug "
"Frasier: Oh, I see those mood swings are leveled off nicely. I'll just run upstairs and have that little meeting with Greg in his office. "
"Roz: Oh, wait, it's been cancelled. He wanted to talk to you about your thousandth show but I ran into him and I handled it. "
"Frasier: All right, let me have it What kind of public circus am I in for? I suppose a garish outdoor rally like the one they gave for Bob and Nipsy over at KPLK "
"Roz: I told him just what you said. That how the work is its own reward, so you're off the hook. "
"Frasier: They're not doing anything? "
"Roz: Nope. "
"Frasier: Well, well done, Roz. That's a relief. Although, I'm not sure I'm being fair to you. You see, I did hear that after that rally, Bob and Nipsy's ratings went up thirty percent. Their producer got a handsome raise. "
"Roz: Oh, yeah. "
"Frasier: And you with the little one coming... "
"Roz: Well, it's too late now. "
"Frasier: Right. Can't be helped. Best to just leave it alone. Still... for the benefit of the station, what's good for KACL's good for all of us, isn't it? "
"Roz: Yeah, that's true. "
"Frasier: You know, well, I suppose you could just give Greg a call and tell him I'd be willing, well for your sake and the station's, to submit to a small tasteful, low-key... public rally. "
"Daphne: I just want to renew my passport No, I'm a resident alien here from England - you know, the country that used to own you people "
"Martin: She'll go right to the head of the line now "
"Daphne: I can't wait two weeks My friend Xena's flying down to meet her mum's ship, Sunday. Don't you put me on hold again I'll hang up, I mean it I showed him "
"Frasier: [acting as though he can't stand the attention but obviously in love with it] Well, it's official. My thousandth show is now an event "
"Martin: What's going on? "
"Frasier: Oh, well, nothing short of a media circus with you-know-who in the centre ring. They're planning a promotional blitzkrieg capped off by a public rally in my honour at the foot of the Space Needle "
"Martin: Wow That's great You're going to be thrilled. "
"Frasier: Well, of course I'm flattered, I'm just a little bit embarrassed, dad. I'd have been content with a pat on the back and an ice cream cake. Oh, dad, they've asked if you might say a few words at the rally. You don't have to, if it makes you nervous. "
"Martin: Oh, no problem Yeah, I can't tell you how many retirement dinners I've spoken at. I can just dig out my old joke book; 'One Thousand And One Side-Splitters, Rib-Ticklers and Thigh-Slappers'. "
"Frasier: I'm sure you're a veritable chiropractor at mirth but I think what they're looking for is something just a bit more personal. "
"Frasier: Hello. Oh, good Lord, the mayor Well, has 'Frasier' fever swept all the way to city hall? Well, all right, Roz, I'll see you tomorrow. "
"Daphne: The mayor's going to be there? "
"Frasier: Yes And not just be there, he's going to present me with a key to the city, after which he's going to proclaim it 'Frasier Crane Day' in Seattle "
"Martin: Way to go, kid "
"Frasier: Who can this be? The mechanic from the Vatican with my Pope- mobile? "
"Frasier: Niles. "
"Niles: Frasier, dinner's on me. I got some very good news today. "
"Daphne: What a coincidence Your brother just got some good news too "
"Niles: Not so good as mine, I suspect. But first of all, I have to apologise for being so snippy this morning. I've been feeling a bit eclipsed lately, but all that vanished when I reached my office, and what was waiting on my desk, but a gift from the self-esteem ferry? "
"Frasier: 'The American Journal of Psychiatry'? "
"Niles: Hmm-mmm, hmm-mmm. I refer you to the letters page, third one down. "
"Frasier: 'Dear Sirs, Dr. Egmond Sandeling's recent article on Trichotilimania contains several errors. He would do well to read the groundbreaking work on the subject published by, among others, Dr. Alan Corville, Dr. Milo Lordestein... "
"Niles: Skip to the end. "
"Frasier: ...Oh, Dr. Geraldine Fenley and Dr. Niles Crane "
"Niles: Not too shabby, eh? "
"Frasier: And quite an accolade. "
"Daphne: Yeah, I had no idea you were such a well-known expert on... on the thing that the letter mentioned. "
"Martin: And the way they saved you for last so you really stand out. "
"Niles: Nothing to kick away the clouds like a heavy sip from the goblet of fame Which reminds me, I told Jean-Claude to start my victory Martini shaking at precisely eight o' clock. "
"Frasier: Off we go, then "
"Niles: Oh, wait, you had some news yourself. Do tell. "
"Frasier: Oh, well, let's just wait for that Martini, shall we? "
"Niles: Happy Frasier Crane Day. Or is it Merry Frasier Crane Day, I can never remember. "
"Frasier: Very amusing. "
"Niles: Sorry I'm late, I stopped half way to listen to a jolly band of Frasier Crane Day carolers I tried to join in on 'The Twelve Days Of Frasier' but, er, forgot the words around day seven. How does it go again? "
"Frasier: I believe it's 'seven snobs a' sniping.' Well, you just snipe away. I take your jealousy as the compliment that it is. "
"Niles: Oh, now, if I indulge in a little affectionate joshing, doesn't mean I'm jealous. I'm nothing but happy for you. "
"Frasier: Oh, thank you, Niles. You know, I'm just a touch skittish today. All this fuss over me. Say, is it possible to get these two to go? "
"Niles: To go? We're not due at the Space Needle for an hour. "
"Frasier: Yes, well, I thought a walk might do us some good, get a little exercise, then maybe I can stroll away my jitters. "
"Niles: Oh, all right, I could use the fresh air, I'm feeling a tad sluggish. "
"Frasier: Oh, up late last night? "
"Niles: Oh, I'm afraid so, as usual I left it till the last minute to write all my Frasier Crane Day cards "
"Frasier: What a lovely day I'm so glad we decided to walk. I feel calmer already. "
"Man: Hey, Doc' Way to go "
"Frasier: Oh, I just hope Dad doesn't get too nervous about his speech today. I've been giving him little tips all week. "
"Niles: Oh, really? As Daphne tells it, you wrote the whole thing for him. "
"Frasier: I did no such thing I added a bon mot or two, tidied up the language, removed any questionable material. "
"Niles: There's not a word of his left, is there? "
"Frasier: Not a comma I'm listening "
"Niles: Here's a tip for you. The ones with cameras are tourists. They have no idea who you are, much less why you're listening. "
"Frasier: Oh, Niles, don't be so churlish. The man clearly waved to me first. "
"Niles: He didn't wave at you "
"Frasier: Yes he did "
"Niles: He was probably waving... "
"Frasier: I don't know why you're even objecting... "
"Niles: He was waving for a cab to get away from the scary listening man "
"Frasier: Oh, I love this place. Here you can feel the pulse of the city. You know what I think when I see all these people here rustling about. "
"Niles: Low turnout over at Frasier Crane Day? "
"Frasier: No I think that they're the reason I love this city. "
"Niles: Stop waving "
"Frasier: Why, there's nothing wrong with being friendly. "
"Niles: Well, there is a difference between being friendly and making a public spectacle of yourself. "
"Niles: Frasier, did you see that man tried to assault me with a fish "
"Frasier: Good Lord, Niles, get a grip. God's sakes, you become hysterical over the littlest things. Oh, my God My suede shoes, you've spilled Latte all over them, they're ruined. "
"Niles: I'm sorry... and it was a half-caf cappuccino, why can no- one remember that "
"Frasier: Well, I'll just have to replace them, I'll look foolish otherwise. "
"Niles: Never in my life have I heard such caterwauling over a pair of shoes. "
"Frasier: I'll have you know, I spent a bundle on these shoes. They're 'Joan and Davids.' "
"Niles: You named them? "
"Frasier: Shut up "
"Frasier: Well, these are quite handsome. Even though they are just a bit snug. "
"Niles: We could always go back. I think there's a pair in there you didn't try on "
"Frasier: We weren't in there that long My God, the rally's about to start. Give me your phone, I'll call Roz. "
"Niles: There you go. "
"Frasier: Thank you. "
"Roz: Hello? Frasier, do you know what time it is? Where the hell are you? We're on the air in two minutes "
"Frasier: I'm sorry, I was involved in a small accident. I'm fine Just start without me, we'll take a cab [hangs up] "
"Niles: We'll have better luck at the corner. "
"Frasier: Right. Niles, wait. Too many fans that way, I'll be mobbed. We'll cut over one block through that alley "
"Roz: Frasier's running late so I've got to use you first, okay, Martin? "
"Martin: Oh, oh, yeah, sure, okay. Jeez, I was hoping for a little more time I haven't even looked at this stuff Frasier wrote for me. "
"Roz: Good afternoon, everyone and welcome also to our radio listeners. I'm Roz Doyle and I'd like to thank you all for helping us congratulate Dr. Frasier Crane. "
"Roz: We've got the full program for you today and.... "
"Daphne: Stop worrying. Dr. Crane's a very good writer. "
"Martin: Well, look at this, I'm gonna die out there with this crap. "
"Roz: Unfortunately, our guest of honour has been detained but we do have the next best thing - his dad, Martin Crane. "
"Martin: Good afternoon. Twenty-three years ago, my son, Frasier, came to me and asked if I would put him through medical school. I agreed to pay for it but remarked 'I should have my head examined.' Frasier replied, 'Give me eight years and I'll do it for you' "
"Martin: It was a hard eight years for Frasier but as someone once quipped, a good psychiatrist never shrinks from a challenge "
"Martin: Oh, Jeez "
"Frasier: Oh, for God's sake, Niles, will you come outta there? "
"Niles: Our mugger specifically instructed us to wait for five minutes "
"Frasier: If he wanted us to time it exactly, he wouldn't have taken our watches "
"Niles: All right, all right, calm down. I see you're new to this whole mugging thing. "
"Frasier: I just can't believe I'm missing my own rally. Come on These shoes are killing me, they're like the work of a skilled Chinese foot binder "
"Frasier: Niles, give me your phone, I'll have Roz send us a car "
"Niles: My phone? What do you think the mugger was reaching into my breast pocket for? Well, the consolation is that he jabbed himself on my emergency sewing kit. "
"Frasier: Niles, a pay phone "
"Niles: It's not much use to us unless we can find a quarter. "
"Frasier: Niles, look. "
"Niles: You cannot be serious, you want to rob that poor old man? "
"Frasier: Don't take it that serious "
"Niles: Frasier, he's blind. "
"Frasier: I know It's the first break we've had today. Niles, I'll distract him. "
"Frasier: Good afternoon. So, sounding lovely. "
"Girl: Stop, thief "
"Frasier: Dear God, run "
"Bulldog: I'd like to thank Frasier Crane for his friendship. "
"Daphne: Excuse me, Mayor Rice? "
"Mayor: Yes. "
"Daphne: I have a small bone to pick with you. I can't say I care for the way your city treats us poor aliens. "
"Mayor: Er, you're an alien? "
"Daphne: Yes, Daphne Moon. You see, my friend, Xena, and I, she's an alien too, we're trying to get down to Mazatlan to rendezvous with her mother's ship... "
"Mayor: Her mothership? "
"Daphne: And from what I hear, it's quite spectacular. "
"Mayor: I'm sure it is. Why don't you go with these two gentlemen? I'm sure they could take care of you. "
"Daphne: Well, thank you very much. "
"Daphne: Hello. "
"Man: Hi. "
"Daphne: Do you two work for the mayor? "
"Man: Yes. "
"Daphne: Well, I suppose I should know that already - you see, I'm a bit psychic. "
"Frasier: I can't go on any longer. My feet are killing me. "
"Niles: We lost... most of them dropped out after the first quarter. But that short one with the pigtails was a regular gazelle. "
"Frasier: Yes. Look It's even farther away than it was before. "
"Niles: The monorail It goes to the Space Needle. "
"Frasier: Let's go "
"Niles: Do you think anyone saw us sneaking on? "
"Frasier: No, I think we're all right. "
"Niles: I hate to say it but it was sort of exciting flaunting the law like that. It gives you some idea as to why outlaws have also been such romantic figures. "
"Frasier: Yes, perhaps you might have cut a more dashing figure had you vaulted over the turnstile rather than crawling underneath it "
"Niles: I'm surprised the trains are even running on Frasier Crane Day "
"Frasier: Yes, well, with any luck we'll still catch the last twenty minutes of the rally. But how I'll explain my lateness, I have no idea. I certainly can't tell them about the fish, the little girls. I'll have to make something up I suppose, any suggestions? "
"Niles: The train stopped. "
"Frasier: That's not very original. "
"Niles: No, Frasier, the train's stopped. "
"Frasier: Good Lord. Excuse me, what's happening? "
"Conductor: There's an electrical problem ahead, we're going back to West Lake. "
"Frasier: What? But those people are waiting for me, they're so close. "
"Conductor: I guess it just isn't your day. "
"Frasier: But it is my day "
"Niles: Don't panic. "
"Frasier: Don't panic? Yes, why should I have any reason to panic? My God, I'm only going to miss a celebration in my honour, I'm going to be a laughingstock forever. And why? Because you spilt coffee on my shoes "
"Niles: You're blaming me? "
"Frasier: Well, if you had the gripping abilities every species above the tree sloth was born with... "
"Niles: You think of those forty-five minutes you and your ego spent in that shoe store, trying on every pair of shoes - including the ones the manager was wearing "
"Frasier: Are you calling me vain? "
"Niles: If the 'Joan & David' fits... "
"Frasier: I don't even know why I'm yelling at you. I guess I'm just trying to blame you because I don't want to face the truth. I'm a big, fat phony. I wanted my day I wanted hoopla and fuss, I practically planned the whole thing myself. "
"Niles: You did? "
"Frasier: Yes. It says a lot about me as a psychiatrist, doesn't it? I'm a small man "
"Niles: Oh, what does it say about me that I was happy seeing you miss your day? "
"Frasier: You were? "
"Niles: Of course. I've been jealous of you all week. I'm a tiny man. "
"Frasier: Next to me you're a giant "
"Niles: I stare up at your ankles "
"Frasier: I'd need a stepladder just to... "
"Niles: Oh, let's not do this. You shouldn't feel guilty, Frasier. Everyone deserves a fuss. You above all. You've helped a lot of people, they deserve a chance to thank you for it. "
"Frasier: Thank you, Niles. "
"Roz: Dr. Crane is on his way, he should be here any minute. "
"Frasier: There it goes. Good bye, fuss. Good bye, day "
"Niles: I hesitate to say this, but you still have time. "
"Frasier: Stop it Don't you dare get my hopes up The ship has sailed, that fat lady has... "
"Frasier: Oh, damn I give up. "
"Niles: Well, I don't. This is your day and if I can get you there for a curtain call, I will. I still have the blind man's quarter. Stay here, I'm going to call a cab. "
"Frasier: Thank you, Niles. Good, run. "
"Driver: Hey, did I hear you yelling for a cab? "
"Frasier: Yes. "
"Driver: I can take you if you want. "
"Frasier: Are you serious? Niles Niles, let's go "
"Driver: What about your friend? "
"Frasier: Oh, he'll be all right. He's got street smarts "
"Driver: Where are we going? "
"Frasier: The Space Needle, please. "
"Driver: No problem, I'll have you there in five minutes. "
"Frasier: That's the first good news I've had all day. "
"Driver: I've had a bit of a rough day myself. "
"Frasier: Oh? "
"Driver: Yeah, my ex-wife is getting remarried in Pennsylvania. Are you going to that rally over there? "
"Frasier: Er, as a matter of fact, I am. "
"Driver: I told her I'd come to the wedding, but now I've got cold feet. Better make up my mind soon, the plane leaves in a few hours. They don't give you any bargains on those last minute tickets, either. "
"Frasier: Maybe this isn't the best time to tell you this, but I'll have to owe you for this ride. "
"Driver: Don't worry about it. We probably never should have gotten married in the first place. We were dumb. Had a few good years, though. "
"Frasier: Oh, that's something at least. "
"Driver: At least the kids are going to be there tomorrow. "
"Frasier: Kids? "
"Driver: Son and a daughter. I don't see them much. They went with their mom after we divorced. Of course, I think I'm more excited about seeing them than they are about seeing me. "
"Frasier: Why would you say that? "
"Driver: Just a feeling. I didn't make much of my life back when Marie and I were together. I turned it around, though. I own this car. "
"Frasier: Well, it's a nice one. "
"Driver: The hardest part is, if I do go, I have to see my in-laws. They never were too crazy about me. This new guy Marie's marrying, he's supposed to be some kinda big success. I don't know what to say to any of them. Part of me thinks I'd just be best leaving the whole thing alone. "
"Frasier: And part of you doesn't? "
"Driver: I'd like to see my kids. Especially now they're getting a new dad. What a choice, eh? "
"Frasier: Well, you know, sometimes difficult choices like these can be good things. They can teach us about who we are. "
"Driver: I bet you hear enough about this. Besides, we're here. "
"Frasier: Oh, don't worry about me, I've got plenty of time. Tell me more about your kids. "
"Driver: I'm John, by the way. "
"Frasier: I'm Frasier. "

"Frasier: Well, Karl, I guess you've got two choices. Either you have the tattoo removed, or you travel the globe searching for another soul mate named Fredwina. We'll be right back after this. "
"Roz: Hey, I was just looking over this offer you got from the Siren Cruise Line. They want to know if— "
"Frasier: Roz, you know my policy on commercial endorsements. "
"Roz: Just listen. One of their celebrity entertainers cancelled on a ship that's going to Alaska, and they'll let us both go for free if you'll fill in, and all you have to do is give a brief lecture— "
"Frasier: Roz, I'm a psychiatrist, not a huckster There are still some of us in this profession who believe in— mahogany wainscoting? "
"Roz: Isn't that fabulous? And just look at those staterooms "
"Frasier: Wow... "
"Roz: Not to mention the gourmet chefs, the world-class health spa... "
"Frasier: Well, it does sound awfully tempting, Roz, but I just don't think it's right to trade on one's good name for a free trip. "
"Roz: Well, plenty of people do. Look, Zubin Mehta did one, General Schwartzkopf, and it says right here, Gore Vidal did two of them "
"Frasier: Gore Vidal? He hates everything "
"Roz: But, if you feel it would tarnish your image, I'll just call Vicki and tell her you said no. "
"Frasier: Vicki? Who's Vicki? "
"Roz: Oh, she books the celebrities. We met once at a party a long time ago, I'm surprised she remembered me. Frasier, we're on in ten seconds. "
"Frasier: Now, just hold on a minute, Roz, you didn't tell me this was a favor for a close friend. "
"Roz: She's not a close friend. "
"Frasier: No, Roz, obviously this woman means something to you. It's certainly an awkward position you've put me in. "
"Roz: Frasier, I don't care. "
"Frasier: All right, I'll go But it's the last time I pull your chestnuts out of the fire "
"Daphne: Hello, Dr. Crane. "
"Frasier: Oh, hello, Daphne. Little late in the day, isn't it? "
"Daphne: I just love days like this... nowhere to go, nothing to do... though I have this sneaking suspicion I've forgotten something. "
"Frasier: Like getting dressed? "
"Daphne: Oh, I could watch the rain for hours. Of course, when I was a little girl, I hated the rain. Stuck inside, couldn't go out and play. But my mum always said, 'enjoy it while you can, there'll be no water in hell.' Of course, that was her answer for everything. 'Eat your veggies, there'll be no Brussels sprouts in hell... have a lie-down, there'll be no naps in hell...' "
"Frasier: Daphne, you know I am a therapist, if you'd like to talk about this sometime. "
"Daphne: About what? "
"Frasier: Nothing. "
"Daphne: I wish I could remember what it is I forgot to do. Oh well, you know what they say — if you can't remember, it probably wasn't important anyway. "
"Frasier: Dad "
"Daphne: Oh no "
"Frasier: You are dripping "
"Martin: Yeah, that's what'll happen when you're standing out on the corner waiting for your ride "
"Daphne: Mr. Crane, I am so sorry "
"Martin: What the hell were you thinking? "
"Frasier: Venting these emotions is all well and good, Dad, but I just had these floors waxed "
"Martin: I said four o'clock on the corner of Second and Bell. "
"Daphne: Well, you should have called me "
"Martin: Well, I was afraid if I went looking for a phone I'd miss you "
"Frasier: Good point, Dad. Now, could you just step on that, please? Oh God, he's wet too "
"Frasier: No, no Damn him Daphne, help me get this canine sprinkler out of here "
"Daphne: Oh now, don't be too cross with him, Dr. Crane As my mum used to say, there'll be no dogs in hell "
"Frasier: I sincerely doubt that "
"Frasier: Oh, Niles. "
"Niles: Frasier, I just stopped by to return your cookbook [hands it over], I won't be needing it after all. "
"Frasier: Oh, really? I thought you were preparing an anniversary dinner for Maris. "
"Niles: Uh, not this year. Maris has flown to Switzerland for a new cosmetic treatment. Only one man performs the procedure, and Maris wants to see him before he's extradited. "
"Frasier: Oh, Niles, I'm so sorry. "
"Niles: It's so depressing. Every time it looks as though we're approaching a breakthrough in our therapy, Maris runs off somewhere. I really hoped spending time together on our anniversary would get us over the hump. "
"Frasier: Take heart, Niles, I know how frustrating it can be when someone puts their own selfishness ahead of your personal needs. "
"Martin: Niles, why don't you take off that wet coat and stay for dinner. I'll get us started with a couple of nice hot toddies, just like we used to make down at Duke's. "
"Frasier: You know, Dad, there's a recipe in this book for a hot toddy. It calls for courvoisier, chamomile tea, and a dash of framboise "
"Martin: Garnish it with a few rose petals and that's just how Duke used to serve it. "
"Frasier: Make yourself comfortable. "
"Frasier: Poor Niles. You know, Dad, maybe I should— "
"Martin: Ah, ah Stop right there, I know what you're going to say. You want to call Maris and talk her into spending her anniversary with Niles. "
"Frasier: I didn't realize I'd gotten as predictable as all that. "
"Martin: Well, you have, and if you ask me— "
"Frasier: Stop right there. I know exactly what you're going to say. You're going to say I should mind my own business and keep my big bazoo shut "
"Martin: I was gonna say 'fat yap,' but you're in the ballpark. "
"Frasier: Well, I just think that when two people are having problems, their emotions can get the better of them. A third party can provide some perspective. "
"Martin: They already have a therapist And if Niles needs any more help, he's got Dr. Jim Beam and he makes house calls "
"Niles: I'm not trying to make you feel guilty, Maris. I hope you enjoy your trip to Switzerland. Actually, I have plans of my own for our anniversary that I'm very excited about. Mmm-hmm. Bon voyage. "
"Frasier: Well, that's a very healthy approach, Niles. What are your plans? "
"Niles: Well, I thought I'd sit alone in my cavernous apartment while rocking back and forth while hugging my knees. "
"Martin: Now, Niles, you're not going to be alone on your anniversary, you'll have me and Fras. "
"Frasier: Well, actually, Dad, I've agreed to give a lecture on a cruise that's going to Alaska... but I don't see any reason why you two shouldn't join me, why don't you? "
"Martin: Oh, that'd be great Wouldn't it, Niles? "
"Niles: Uh, I don't know. "
"Frasier: Oh, come on, Niles, it'll help get your mind off your troubles. "
"Niles: I appreciate your concern, but whisking me off on a cruise? I'm not as emotionally fragile as all that. "
"Frasier: As you wish. Well, Dad, I guess it'll be just you and me then. "
"Martin: Yeah When do we leave? "
"Frasier: Fourteenth. "
"Niles: The fourteenth? "
"Roz: Hey, some ship, huh? How's your stateroom? "
"Frasier: I'd hardly call it a 'stateroom.' Wouldn't even call it a room, but I don't know the nautical term for 'broom closet with sconces.' How's yours? "
"Roz: The same. Worse, even. I'm sure you have a better view from your porthole than I do. "
"Frasier: You have a porthole? "
"Roz: What's the difference? A cabin's just a place to shower and change your clothes. "
"Frasier: You have a shower? All I have is a nozzle and a floor drain, it took me an hour before I put those two things together "
"Martin: Now the buffets come at a pretty good clip, so you got to pace yourself. And watch out for your fillers—your breads, your rolls, your chips and dip. You've only got so much room, don't be a hero. "
"Roz: Hey, guys "
"Martin: Hey Hey, Fras, this is great You got one of those bedrooms where the bathroom turns into a shower? "
"Frasier: Yes, Dad. And before you say anything, I had no idea what Spartan conditions we were in for. "
"Niles: It's quite all right. Once I got over my fear that I'd be hauled below deck and manacled to another oarsman, I actually started to enjoy myself. "
"Frasier: Well, you know, I guess I won't be spending that much time in my cabin anyway. I'll be hobnobbing with my fellow celebrities. "
"Martin: Yeah, they got a lot of big names on board. Did you see the pictures? "
"Roz: 'Live and in "
"Person: Radio star Dr. Frasier Crane' How about that? "
"Frasier: Lord, I don't know if I really care for the word 'star,' considering the caliber of the other people on board. "
"Niles: 'The Comedy Stylings of Giggles O'Shea.' Oh yes, you're in stellar company. Oh, and look, they even managed to snare a magician—'The Amazing Lance Gould.' "
"Martin: Oh, he's great I caught his act in Reno a few years ago. For his finale, he made his own head disappear "
"Niles: Now, did the toupee go too, or did it just hover over the collar? "
"Frasier: Dear God You've booked me on a floating Gong Show What happened to Zubin Mehta and Gore Vidal? "
"Roz: I am so sorry, Frasier, I had no idea. I guess they just booked all their A-list celebrities on the big ships. "
"Steward: Your attention, please. The 'Taste of Alaska' buffet is no being served on the Lido deck. "
"Martin: Ooh, that's my cue You guys coming? "
"Niles: Uh, Dad, we had a big lunch at home. "
"Martin: Rookie mistake. See you at dinner. "
"Roz: Look, Frasier, it's not that bad. I mean, at least you got top billing. "
"Frasier: Well, of course I got top billing I'm the only one up there I've ever heard of "
"Roz: Come on, what about him? "
"Frasier: 'Latin Singing Sensation Carlos 'the Barracuda' DelGato?' "
"Roz: Yeah Don't you remember him from the 70's? He invented that big dance craze, the Barracuda. "
"Niles: Believe it or not, Maris was a big fan of his. "
"Frasier: No "
"Niles: Yes, that was the one dance she could do. The Hustle was too strenuous — she had no booty to shake. But her fetching little under-bite was just perfect for the Barracuda. "
"Frasier: Niles, why is that woman staring at you? "
"Niles: God help me It's that awful Mimi Cosgrove from the country club Hide me She's a man-eating lush who'd go to any lengths to— "
"Mimi: Niles? "
"Niles: Mimi You funny little good-for-nothing Mimi [kisses her cheeks] What are you doing here? "
"Mimi: Oh, just looking for the bar... oh, there it is [grabs his arm] Let me buy you a cocktail. "
"Niles: Well, actually, I— "
"Mimi: I don't know what it is about being on the water that makes me so thirsty Ooh, have you been working out? ' A swarthy Latin man in Toreador pants comes in. "
"Roz: Look, there he is, the Barracuda "
"Frasier: How thrilling A fellow headliner on the U.S.S. Has-Been "
"Roz: Oh, shut up "
"Frasier: Come on, Roz, let's go over my notes for my lecture. "
"Barracuda: Dr. Frasier Crane? I am Carlos DelGato. "
"Frasier: Ah, hello. It's a pleasure to meet you. Oh, this is Roz Doyle. "
"Barracuda: Buenos noches. Habla espanol? "
"Roz: Uh, not really. "
"Barracuda: Is no matter. I am sure you are schooled in the... international language. "
"Frasier: Oh yes, Roz, say something amusing in Esperanto "
"Barracuda: You know, each night, I select the most beautiful woman in my audience and present to her a red rose. That means the evening has just begun. Perhaps one night, chou will be... my especial lady? Until then... "
"Roz: O.K., you're right. We're on the Voyage of the Damned. "
"Mimi: So, are you still separated? "
"Niles: Uh, I'm afraid so. "
"Mimi: Oh, you poor thing. "
"Niles: Well, we're trying actually — couples' therapy. "
"Mimi: Oh, good You know I've always thought the world of you and, uh... "
"Niles: Maris. "
"Mimi: Yeah, an angel Anyway, if there's ever anything I can do to be of comfort to you, you just let me know. Ooh, what is that marvelous fragrance? "
"Niles: Well, that's uh— "
"Waiter: Excuse me, sir, but the lady wanted to send you this, with her compliments. "
"Niles: What lady? "
"Waiter: Over there, in the black dress and the veil? "
"Niles: Maris "
"Waiter: Oh, and there was one more thing. "
"Niles: Yes? "
"Waiter: I'm really very sorry, sir, but she gave me the biggest tip I've ever seen. "
"Mimi: I'm sure you can convince Maris that this is all completely innocent—if not, I'm in Cabin 712. "
"Frasier: Niles, Niles, what happened? Was that Maris I saw running out of here? "
"Niles: Yes She saw Mimi pawing me and assumed the worst I've got to go speak to her. How upset did she look? "
"Roz: Oh, I couldn't see anything past the outfit. Who wears a black dress and veil on a cruise? "
"Frasier: Roz, the woman has virtually no pigmentation Three minutes in the sun, she'd sear like an Ahi tuna "
"Niles: She's supposed to be in Switzerland What's she doing here? "
"Frasier: Niles, I'm sorry. This may be partly my fault. You see, I called Maris, told her how upset you were, and said it might be fun if she could join us on the cruise. "
"Niles: You invited her to come and didn't tell me? "
"Frasier: Well, I thought it would be a nice surprise "
"Niles: Oh, well it worked out perfectly She's probably on the phone arranging to fly home from the next port. [the waiter comes by] Excuse me, excuse me. The lady who sent me the champagne, do you happen to know which stateroom she's in? "
"Waiter: No, sir. But she did ask me to give you a message. "
"Niles: Yes? "
"Niles: Just out of curiosity, how much are these running her? "
"Roz: You're on in twenty minutes. How's your speech coming? "
"Frasier: It's hard to concentrate. I'm so concerned about Niles. "
"Roz: I like this opening joke you wrote, it's very funny. "
"Frasier: Thank you. I can't take all the credit, actually. I had a patty melt with Giggles before his show. "
"Frasier: Oh, Niles. I can't tell you again how sorry I am for meddling. How did it go with Maris? "
"Niles: Terribly. This is, without a doubt, the most depressing night of my life. "
"Roz: That is so funny— I'm sorry. "
"Niles: I spent hours looking for her, then I remembered her fondness for the Barracuda. I ran down to the lounge, and found that Latin cheese ball crooning his ghastly song directly to her I started to make my way over, then a waiter came over, and by the time I got the champagne out of my eyes, she'd disappeared into the crowd. I waited for her. She never came out. Neither did DelGato. "
"Frasier: Niles, what are you implying? "
"Niles: You know Maris's taste for revenge. If she thinks I'm having an affair with Mimi, then she's going to try and punish me in kind. "
"Roz: Wow... do you really think she's planning to 'do the Barracuda?' "
"Frasier: Niles, don't jump to conclusions, that's exactly what Maris did. "
"Niles: Says a lot about our marriage, doesn't it? No trust on either side, what hope is there for us? "
"Frasier: Is there anything I can do? "
"Niles: No, you've done enough. I'm just going to take a walk. "
"Frasier: Oh, I feel so guilty about this. When will I learn to stop interfering in other peoples' affairs? I'd better go talk to Maris, see if I can fix this. "
"Roz: You're gonna butt in again? "
"Frasier: I don't see what business that is of yours "
"Roz: Here comes your dad. "
"Frasier: Oh, no Oh, no If he finds out, I'll never hear the end of it "
"Martin: Boy, that 'Taste of Alaska' spread was a bust. You want to know what caribou meat tastes like? Not chicken Where's Niles? "
"Frasier: He's out on a walk... oh, I may as well tell you everything Maris is on board. She and Niles had a horrible fight, and their marriage is in worse shape than it's ever been before, and no need to tell you how she got here in the first place "
"Martin: I know, I know, what was I thinking, inviting her to come on the cruise? "
"Roz: You invited Maris? "
"Martin: Yeah, well, Niles was so upset over being alone on his anniversary, it just seemed like a good idea. Smart, huh? I give you all this guff about sticking your nose into other people's business, then I turn around and do the same damn thing. "
"Frasier: Oh, Dad, don't be too hard on yourself. "
"Roz: Frasier. "
"Frasier: Oh, all right I invited Maris too. "
"Martin: You did? I thought I told you to keep your big bazoo shut "
"Frasier: Oh, you're one to talk "
"Martin: Well, so what do we do now? "
"Frasier: Nothing Nothing at all Just let them work things out themselves, and stay on the sidelines where we belong. "
"Martin: All right. Ooh, better get going, we're gonna miss the first seating for dinner "
"Frasier: But Dad, my lecture's in fifteen minutes. "
"Martin: Oh, jeez. All right, guess I can't do everything. Tell me how it went at the midnight buffet "
"Roz: We'd better get going too. "
"Frasier: Right. First, I'm going to go talk to Maris. "
"Roz: You just said— "
"Frasier: Forget what I said You're coming too "
"Roz: Why do you need me? I don't even know her. "
"Frasier: You can vouch for Niles's innocence. "
"Roz: Oh, all right. I have to admit, I'm kind of curious to meet her. You know, in all these years, I've never actually seen her face? "
"Frasier: Well, I haven't seen her most recent one, so this'll be a new experience for both of us. "
"Frasier: All right, now let me do all the talking—oh, and if it looks like she has an orange Abyssinian on her head—don't stare. That's a wiglet. "
"Maid: All through. Have a nice evening. "
"Frasier: Damn She must not be here Roz, what are you doing, you can't go in there "
"Roz: I just want to see the room "
"Frasier: You can't just barge into someone else's— My God, is that a grand piano? "
"Roz: Frasier, look "
"Frasier: The Barracuda's calling card That means that he's chosen Maris to be his... "
"Roz: 'Especial lady,' eew "
"Roz: Why are we hiding? We came here to talk to her "
"Frasier: Because it's impossible to extol the virtues of trust to someone whose room you've just broken into "
"Frasier: Oh, dear God The shower is bigger than my entire cabin "
"Roz: Shut up "
"Roz: Martin "
"Martin: Ahh What are you two doing here? "
"Frasier: We came to talk to Maris What are you doing here? "
"Martin: The same as you "
"Frasier: Well, then why did you come in the bathroom? "
"Martin: Well... what do you think? "
"Frasier: Oh, all right, fine. "
"Roz: Let's get the hell out of here. "
"Roz: It's Maris. "
"Martin: Well, what's the big deal, why don't we just go in there and talk to her? "
"Roz: We can't go in there now, she might not be alone. Remember the rose? "
"Frasier: Oh, God. "
"Roz: I don't see her, maybe she went back out. Oh, wait. I see her coat on a hat rack. "
"Frasier: Look closer. Is the hat rack moving? "
"Roz: Oh my God "
"Martin: What's she doing? "
"Roz: Well, she seems to be alone. "
"Frasier: That's good. "
"Roz: Now she's pouring champagne — two glasses. "
"Frasier: Oh, that's bad. "
"Roz: Now she's putting on music. "
"Frasier: Oh, oh, that's bad. On so many levels. "
"Roz: She's coming this way "
"Frasier: She's gone "
"Martin: How the hell are we going to get out of here? "
"Frasier: I have no idea. All I know is that I have got to be downstairs in the next ten minutes, or two hundred people are going to be sorely disappointed "
"Roz: Two hundred people? Where'd you hear that? "
"Frasier: They told me that was the room capacity [Roz just looks at him] Oh Oh, come on Giggles had to add a show "
"Martin: Shh, she's gonna hear us. "
"Roz: It's the Barracuda "
"Martin: Who's the Barracuda? "
"Roz: He's a sleazy Latin lounge singer Maris is going to sleep with to get back at Niles for kissing Mimi "
"Martin: Who's Mimi? "
"Frasier: A horny society boozer, and the Mrs. O'Leary's Cow of our current predicament "
"Martin: Who's Mrs. O'Leary? "
"Frasier: A woman in Chicago who — oh, I don't have the time The point is, we have got to stop this before Maris does something that is going to damage her relationship forever. "
"Roz: We cannot go out there. We don't want to walk in on the two of them. "
"Martin: I don't want to see that I just ate caribou "
"Frasier: Oh, all right. Seems I'm the only one who cares about this relationship. I will go and do it. "
"Niles: Maris, what a lovely bathroom Naaah [comes in and shuts the door] What are you doing here? "
"Frasier: We came to convince Maris that there was nothing going on between you and Mimi What are you doing here? "
"Niles: Well, Maris and I ran into each other on deck, and we had a long talk, and, well, she invited me back here for a glass of champagne "
"Martin: Oh, that's great, Niles "
"Niles: Yes, though it might marr the mood a bit if she finds you all spying on her Did you use that mouthwash? "
"Frasier: No, Maris did. "
"Niles: My God — she's in the mood for more than champagne You've got to leave right now. Just give me time to see her out to the balcony. "
"Frasier: A balcony? "
"Niles: Count to ten, and then scram, so Maris and I can celebrate the way a man and his wife were meant to. Oh, damn. She started without me. "
"Roz: Eeww... "
"Niles: Drinking the champagne. "

"Frasier: For you. "
"Roz: Oh. "
"Frasier: A little token of thanks after you cut those new promos, Dr. Frank on KTLK practically vanished from the radio. [as she opens gift] I know I'm not very good at picking up gifts for people usually, but when I saw this in the window, I knew it was perfect for you. "
"Frasier: Still, maybe I should have gone with the shawl. "
"Roz: No, it's not the purse. Although I do hate it I don't even know why I'm crying. "
"Frasier: Oh, Roz, it's the pregnancy. A soup of hormones churns through your body and naturally your emotions are rising and falling at the slightest provocation. "
"Roz: That's idiotic "
"Frasier: All right, all right, is there something else going on? "
"Roz: Last night was a disaster "
"Frasier: Oh, right, your date. "
"Roz: You see, everything was going fine until he tried to order me a drink, but then I told him I was pregnant. "
"Frasier: You didn't tell him you were pregnant before the date? "
"Roz: Well, that's not the easiest thing in the world to tell someone Besides, I was hoping my radiant glow would do the talking for me "
"Frasier: Your glow Please, Roz, do you really think that... ...anyone could miss your glow? "
"Roz: So, I tell him, and he says, 'Fine, it's not a problem'. Five minutes later, he tells me his pager's vibrating, he has an emergency, he has to go to work. "
"Frasier: Well, maybe he was telling the truth. "
"Roz: He sells wicker furniture Who needs their end tables re- caned at nine-thirty at night "
"Frasier: Roz, oh, God, Roz, Roz, look, I owe you an apology, Roz. It's not the hormones, you're embarking on a tremendous life- changing journey, now, naturally, anybody would be emotional. For what it's worth, I think you're handling it beautifully. "
"Roz: Oh, thanks, Frasier. "
"Roz: I just need to go back to work. "
"Roz: My God My pen is out of ink "
"Frasier: Well, let's not discount the hormones all together. "
"Frasier: Hello. I'd like to return this purse. "
"Assistant: I'm terribly sorry but this was a sale item and we have a no-return policy. You wife didn't like it? "
"Frasier: Well, I'm not married at the moment. "
"Assistant: Girlfriend? "
"Frasier: No, no, no, no girlfriend either, in fact I don't have time to go into all my other non-existent relationships, it was a gift for a friend. "
"Assistant: Ah, well, perhaps your FRIEND would like to make it work with some matching shoes. We have up to size thirteen. "
"Frasier: This really was a gift and I would thank you when you said the word 'friend' not to italicise it "
"Sam: Excuse me, sir, I couldn't help overhearing, may I help you out here? "
"Frasier: If you hold her down, I can do the rest. "
"Sam: Well, hopefully, that won't be necessary. "
"Sam: Ah, look, Jill, we're all reasonable people here, why don't you just give this nice gentleman a store credit. "
"Assistant: Look, I don't make the rules. "
"Sam: Yes, but a shrewd saleswoman such as yourself knows that this business isn't about rules, it's about relationships. Now, look at this man, cultured, impeccably dressed, well- to-do, exactly the sort of man you'd love to have a relationship with... Now, there's only one thing standing in the way of that relationship, Jill, he's not happy with his purse. "
"Frasier: It's not MY purse. "
"Sam: Maybe his purse was the wrong colour, maybe it didn't hold enough. "
"Frasier: It's not my purse. "
"Sam: The thing is, if this man walks away today unhappy, he may never shop here again, and who knows what he might have bought in the future; scarves, gloves, hosiery The choice is yours, Jill, the commission that comes from a lifelong relationship or the hollow satisfaction of knowing you followed the rules "
"Assistant: Okay, I'll go get the forms. "
"Frasier: Thank you, that was very impressive. "
"Sam: You should see me return something hard, like a house or a kidney You see the secret is persistence. "
"Frasier: Ah, I'm Frasier Crane. "
"Sam: I'm Samantha Pierce; Sam. Are you Dr. Frasier Crane? "
"Frasier: Yes, I am. "
"Sam: Oh, I thought your voice sounded familiar. Though for a while there, I thought you were the white zone's for loading and unloading only guy "
"Frasier: Sam, listen, may I thank you for taking me to dinner tonight? "
"Sam: Oh, well, that's very sweet of you, but I was really just trying to be a good samaritan, thanks anyway. "
"Frasier: Oh, no, thank you. "
"Sam: Bye. "
"Frasier: Goodbye. "
"Frasier: Oh, Sam... "
"Sam: Okay, I'd love to go to dinner. "
"Frasier: Well, that's wonderful. "
"Sam: You see, persistence pays off "
"Frasier: Actually, I was going to ask you to get my parking validated, but this works out very well too. "
"Martin: What are you doing? "
"Frasier: Just watchin' football with you. What's the score? "
"Martin: 27-20. "
"Frasier: Oh, thanks. "
"Martin: Do you want to know who's winning? "
"Frasier: Not particularly, no. "
"Daphne: Well, someone has a special evening planned. "
"Frasier: As a matter of fact, I do. What tipped you off? My incredible self-confident air? "
"Daphne: No, your silver collar pin, you only wear it when you've got a hot date Good work getting all the tarnish off, it showed up quite nicely. "
"Daphne: Good evening, Dr. Crane. "
"Niles: Hello, Daphne. Dad, Frasier. "
"Frasier: Niles. "
"Niles: You gentlemen ready to go? "
"Martin: Now, give me a minute. "
"Frasier: Well, actually, I can't make it to the boat show with you and dad, this evening it will just be the two of you. "
"Niles: Oh, too bad Well, maybe some other time? Goodness, it is a clear night? "
"Frasier: Yes, it's been rather windy lately. "
"Niles: Just look at those stars, is that Orion? "
"Frasier: Yes, I believe it is. "
"Niles: A-ha. What the hell are you doing? We entered into a support pact, whenever there's a dad event, we're there for each other. "
"Frasier: Niles I have a date with a spectacular woman "
"Niles: So what? I gave up 'Traviata' tickets to support you at a tractor pull "
"Martin: Hey, Niles, I thought that we could stop at that Medieval restaurant for dinner. "
"Niles: Oh, sounds great, dad. "
"Frasier: Daphne. Would you be interested in using my ticket to the boat show tonight? "
"Daphne: Yes, that would be nice. "
"Niles: Very crafty. "
"Daphne: So, who's the lucky lady? "
"Frasier: You know, the name is Samantha Pierce, we just met yesterday. She recognised me from my radio show, you know what, in fact, when I asked her out, I sensed a bit of shyness which made me wonder if she was perhaps intimidated by my fame. "
"Martin: Did you say Samantha Pierce? "
"Frasier: Yeah, dad. "
"Martin: Short blonde hair, blue eyes? "
"Frasier: Right, how would you know that? "
"Martin: She's on 'Larry King' "
"King: We're here with noted attorney, Samantha Pierce, she's in Los Angeles to appear with us. Currently, she's trying a case in Seattle defending the butcher knife killer. Sam, I have to ask you. Don't you think being in the public eye, dating some of the world's most famous men, affects the way juries perceive you? "
"Sam: Now, that's not really fair, Larry. I don't date public figures. "
"King: What about the much-publicised relationship with Kevin Costner? "
"Sam: Oh, that's just a rumour. "
"King: George Stepanopolous? "
"Sam: A rumour too. "
"King: Brad Pitt is another rumour? "
"Sam: Yeah, but I started that one. "
"Niles: I can certainly see how she'd be intimidated by your fame "
"Frasier: Gee, you know, I thought her name sounded familiar. I must have read it in the newspaper. "
"Martin: Congratulations, Fras', you're playing in the big leagues now. Kevin Costner, Stepanopolous... you "
"Daphne: Don't let him shake your confidence. You'll be fine. Maybe she's had her fare of attractive men and is ready for a change. "
"Frasier: Well, aren't I lucky? Normally a forest troll like me has to trick a woman to get a date "
"Daphne: No, all I'm saying is, I once dated a man who'd gone out with several of the top British actresses but got sick of their vanity and insecurity. "
"Frasier: So there, you see, it does happen. "
"Daphne: Course, after he got through slumming, he dumped me and went back to actresses. But he did get me an autographed picture of Helena Bonham Carter. She's riding a pony "
"Sam: So, Teddy Kennedy, Henry Kissinger and the Dalai Lama are all in this plane... "
"Frasier: Wait, wait, I think I've heard this joke. "
"Sam: No, no, this really happened to me about a month ago. "
"Frasier: Well, don't I feel silly. "
"Sam: Never mind, it's not a very good story anyway. "
"Frasier: So, how's your appetiser? "
"Sam: Oh, it's delicious. Your salad? "
"Frasier: It's very good. Well, I haven't even tried it yet. Ah, yes, I was right. "
"Sam: Look, I hope this doesn't offend you, but I'm having a stressful day and I really don't have the energy to make a lot of small talk, plus I'm not very hungry. Would you mind terribly... "
"Frasier: Look, I think I know where this is headed. You don't have to say. "
"Sam: Frasier, can we just go someplace and have sex? "
"Frasier: Well, that, you did have to say. "
"Sam: I'm sorry if that sounded forward, but it's the only thing I really want to do right now. "
"Frasier: Well, I'm flattered and the thought is very tempting, but you see on my show, I'm constantly preaching that people should get to know one another, have things in common, before taking that kind of step. What's your favourite colour? "
"Sam: Blue. "
"Frasier: Mine too. Check, please "
"Frasier: Oh, a-hoy there mateys. How was the boat show? "
"Daphne: Oh, it was wonderful. "
"Martin: Yeah, they had this one great exhibit, where you climb into this boat, you put on a life jacket and they simulate what it's like to be caught out at sea in a hurricane. "
"Frasier: Good Lord, Niles, why did you ever agree to go on a ride like that? "
"Niles: I didn't; I dined at the snack bar. "
"Martin: Well, I guess this wasn't a very hot night for you, huh, home by ten thirty? "
"Frasier: Well... "
"Sam: Found my bra "
"Sam: Oh, well, this is a little embarrassing. "
"Frasier: Oh, not at all, not at all. Sam, this is my brother, Dr. Niles Crane, my father, Martin Crane and his health care worker, Daphne Moon. "
"Daphne: I've been watching the trial on TV, it's fascinating. "
"Sam: For us too. Well, I better be going, I'm early in the morning. "
"Frasier: Right. "
"Sam: Lovely meeting all of you. "
"Frasier: I had a wonderful evening. "
"Sam: So did I. Good night. "
"Frasier: Well, I'm off to bed. "
"Niles: Oh, no, no, no, not so fast, mister I can tell by that goofy smile of yours that you're obviously smitten with this woman. "
"Frasier: Thank you, Niles, but I am not some dewey-eyed teenager. She did say the cutest things... that murderers often show no remorse for their action because they have no moral center. "
"Frasier: It was cute the way she said it. "
"Frasier: All right, now, I want you to taste this, tell me what you think. "
"Sam: Mmmm, that's spectacular, where did you learn how to do that? "
"Frasier: That's just a little something I picked up as a child at sauce camp. "
"Sam: Hello. What? When did this happen? Well, because we're expected to give full disclosure. Can't Brendan handle it? Oh, all right. "
"Sam: I suppose you know what I'm about to say. "
"Frasier: You wanna skip dinner again and go straight to sex? "
"Sam: I'm sorry, Frasier, I really am. And you went to all this trouble. "
"Frasier: It's all right. You know fine French cooking, it's always better after a night in the fridge. "
"Martin: Don't worry, we just came back to get our umbrellas and then we're leaving. "
"Frasier: No, no, no, stay, stay. "
"Sam: It's all right, I've been called back to work. It would be a shame to let a good meal go to waste. "
"Niles: Ah, Frasier's morel mushroom and tarragon sauce. "
"Sam: Wow, how did you know that? "
"Frasier: Niles has always been able to identify a sauce from a great distance. "
"Martin: His mother and I were so proud "
"Sam: Well, if it's not too late, maybe I'll be able to come back over afterwards. "
"Sam: Either well, I'll call you. "
"Frasier: That's what you said yesterday, but you forgot. "
"Sam: I told you I was sorry about that. I promise, I'll call. "
"Daphne: What a shame, and after you cooked that lovely meal. "
"Frasier: Yes, let me tell you something, Crown Roast does not prepare itself You know, it's funny, as much as I care for this woman, there's something about this relationship that leaves me vaguely unsettled. "
"Niles: I might venture a theory at which you're sure to hoot What may be making you uncomfortable is that for the first time you find yourself in a more submissive role. "
"Frasier: What on God's earth are you talking about? "
"Daphne: I think what he means is - you're the girl "
"Niles: Well, think about it. How did you two first meet? She came to your rescue. Who initiated the first sexual encounter? She did. "
"Martin: She did? For God's sake, who's wearing the pants in this relationship? "
"Niles: My point exactly, dad. "
"Frasier: Oh, fine, look, as much fun it must be to spin out this little theory, it's entirely without foundation. "
"Frasier: Dear God, there's my Rosemary Bread "
"Daphne: Look, if it's any consolation, I know what you're going through. Women have been putting up with it for generations. Men say they'll call and they don't, or you get a few nice dinners and then the eventual booty call. "
"Frasier: I did not get a booty call What's a booty call? "
"Daphne: It's a late night call inviting you to meet but with the true goal of just having sex. "
"Frasier: Oh, God, I did get a booty call. "
"Martin: You know, Frasier, if you ask me, you should nip this thing in the bud before it gets out of hand. I don't think we have to look beyond our own family to find an example of someone who let a woman run the show from the beginning and has been paying for it ever since. "
"Niles: Poor Uncle Frank. "
"Frasier: Well, I can see I'm wasting my time fighting you people. You can take the tiniest detail from my relationship with Sam and twist it to support your ridiculous theory. "
"Sam: I saw a guy out on the street selling these, I thought they might cheer you up. "
"Frasier: Oh, Sam, they're beautiful. "
"Sam: I really gotta run. "
"Frasier: Oh, I suppose, now, you're going to read something into this "
"Sam: God, I really love that tie. "
"Frasier: Oh, as well you should, you sent it to me. "
"Sam: Oh, yeah, right. "
"Frasier: You had your secretary pick it up, didn't you? "
"Sam: Yes, but only because he has better taste than I do. Don't worry about tonight, Frasier, I know how boring these lawyer parties always are. "
"Daniel: Sam. "
"Sam: Oh, Frasier, I'd like you to meet our senior partner, Daniel Peel. "
"Daniel: Hi, how are you? Sam, they're ready for us on that conference call. "
"Sam: Oh, right, yeah, well, it'll just take a minute. "
"Jennifer: Who are you? "
"Frasier: I'm Frasier. "
"Jennifer: I'm Jennifer, Stewart's wife. "
"Frasier: Hello. "
"Jennifer: And this is Cindy Dolsay, she's married to Bob. Terri Bailey, she's living with Ned. And Vanessa St. Clare, soon to be Mrs. Irving Lumpowsky. "
"Frasier: Well, good heavens. "
"Vanessa: So, how long have you and Sam been seeing each other? "
"Frasier: Well, actually, just about three weeks. We haven't really been able to get much time together, but she assures me that'll all change as soon as the... "
"Women: "
"Jennifer: There's always another trial, but you'll get used to the life. Dates get cancelled, dinners left uneaten but at least you'll get sent plenty of flowers. "
"Cindy: Oh, Jennifer, he's a man, he won't get flowers. "
"Frasier: Oh, Sam, Sam, could I have a word with you in private. "
"Sam: Sure. "
"Sam: Is there something wrong? "
"Frasier: Well, now's the not best time to bring this up, but, please, I'm feeling an uneasiness about this relationship. "
"Sam: What do you mean? "
"Frasier: Well, er, look, I'm not one to get bogged down in male/female role playing, it's just that lately, well... Take our first date, we'd barely begun dinner when you suggested that we run off and go to bed together, well, traditionally that is... well, every man's dream, okay, bad example But then, the way that you cancel dates all the time and say you'll call and you don't call, and then you have your secretary send me a gift and then when I get upset about it, you think you can buy we off with flowers. "
"Sam: Is that it? That's what you dragged me out here for? I'm in the middle of the most intense case of my entire career, a man's life hangs in the balance and you're whining about flowers? "
"Frasier: Well, I think whining's a little strong. "
"Sam: Well, well, tell me what you mean, Frasier. I mean, if you're the one who has to work late hours and is breaking all the dates and is sending flowers and gifts, would that be okay? "
"Frasier: No, no, it's.... "
"Sam: Good God You're a psychiatrist, shouldn't you be above all this? "
"Frasier: Look, I'm just telling you how I feel and now you're yelling at me "
"Sam: Well, just tell me what you want, Frasier. Do you want to be the traditional man, and I'll be the put-upon woman? "
"Frasier: No. That's not what I want. I just wish that we could have a relationship where neither one of us is the man. "
"Sam: So, that would make us, what? A lesbian couple? "
"Frasier: Well, they're very in now. "
"Sam: I know no-one likes being stood up. I'll try to be more understanding. "
"Frasier: And I'll try to stop being so damn emotional. "
"Sam: You know, I'm glad we had this little talk because I was about to make a very big mistake. "
"Frasier: What? "
"Sam: Well, the other day, when we were at the store, you mentioned that you liked something and, well, typical me, I just ran right out and bought it. "
"Frasier: Oh, well, we certainly dodged the bullet, there didn't we? What was it? "
"Frasier: And you bought this for me? "
"Sam: Yeah, I'm really rather embarrassed, Frasier. You were right, I take relationships for granted and then I just run right off to Cartier and buy you an expensive gift to make up for it "
"Frasier: Cartier? "
"Sam: I'll return it, I promise. I know how strongly you feel. "
"Frasier: Well, you know, maybe I've been just a bit self-absorbed lately and if you're really the kind of person who likes to express their affections by buying gifts then who am I to stand in your way? All right, it's lovely. "
"Frasier: Well... "
"Sam: No, Frasier, about the gift, I just give gifts because I can never think of the right words to... "
"Frasier: Is this what you're trying to say? "
"Sam: Very well put. Well, what do you say we get out of here? I'll get our coats. "
"Frasier: No, no, I will get out coats. "
"Sam: You don't know where they are. "
"Frasier: Oh, all right, you get them. "
"Jennifer: I'm so bored. What time is it? "
"Frasier: Time? Well, let's just have a look. "

"Customer: Half caff latte, please. "
": Half caff latte "
"Waitress: Half caff latte "
": Half caff latte "
"Niles: I rather like this new system, it's lively. "
": Well, it's more efficient. What can I get for you? "
"Niles: I'll have a double shot, low fat, no foam latte. "
": Double shot, low fat, no foam latte "
"Waitress: Double shot, non fat, low foam latte "
": Double shot, non fat, no foam latte "
"Niles: Excuse me, I think there was a problem in the chain of command, the middle person reversed part of it. She said, 'A double shot, non fat, low foam latte'. "
": Double shot, non fat, low foam latte "
"Waitress: Double shot, non fat, low foam latte "
": Double shot, non fat, no foam latte "
"Niles: No, it happened again, that's not what I want. "
": Well, you can tell her youself. "
"Niles: All right, I'll have a double shot, low fat, no foam latte. "
"Waitress: Double shot, low fat, no foam latte. "
": Double shot, low fat, no foam latte. Nutmeg? "
"Waitress: Nutmeg? "
": Nutmeg? "
"Niles: No thanks. It inflames my stomach lining. "
": Inflames his stomach lining "
"Waitress: Inflames his stomach lining "
": Inflames his stomach lining "
"Niles: Stop that "
"Frasier: Hello, Niles. "
"Niles: Welcome back. I trust you and Samantha had a pleasant weekend? "
"Frasier: Oh, God, it was fabulous. We stayed at this gorgeous cabin just outside Aspen, we took a chopper every morning to the top of the mountain, God, I just didn't want it to end. "
"Niles: That would explain why you're still wearing that ridiculous jacket in an over heated café. "
"Frasier: Oh, well, in Aspen they all wear them indoors. Oh, God, the funniest thing happened in the lodge last night. Jack Nicholson and Tom Brokaw discovered they were wearing exactly the same jacket. So they staged a mock fight. Suddenly, Donna Karen flew between them pretending to referee, I laughed so hard I nearly spilled my toddy on someone named Puff Daddy. "
"Waitress: Can I get anything for you? "
"Niles: Just a dustpan and broom to sweep up some of these names "
"Frasier: Cappucino, please. "
"Frasier: Oh, by the way, Niles. Do we have plans for tonight? "
"Niles: Yes, why? "
"Frasier: Well, I'm afraid I have to cancel. It's my one month anniversary with Sam, I'd like to take her to L'escalias for dinner. "
"Niles: I understand, of course. One month is quite a milestone, thanks for the reminder - I need to change my water filter. Damn, they put nutmeg on this "
"Frasier: Oh, speaking of Meg. Meg Ryan told me the most delightful story about practical joke Tony Hopkins played on Jodie at the ramp party for the 'Lambs'. "
"Niles: My stomach lining is just not going to get a break today, is it? "
"Sam: Look, I'm sorry I was late, Frasier. "
"Frasier: Oh, gosh, no, no, that's all right. I took the liberty of ordering us the 'Taste Of Monaco' dinner. "
"Sam: Oh, good choice. "
"Frasier: As I recall, that's what you ordered on our first date. Course, it wasn't food that you were craving that night. You whisked me away back to my place before the crab cakes could even arrive. You know, there's no better way to celebrate an anniversary than with a historical re-enactment. I've got my costume on underneath "
"Sam: Actually, I'm really looking forward to those crab cakes. "
"Frasier: Oh, great, well, yes, yes, I suppose we should try the food here once. Well, be sure to leave some room, you're bound to find a little Frasier-mint on your pillow when we get home By the way, thanks again for this weekend. "
"Sam: You're welcome. "
"Frasier: You know, it's funny, I think it was a real turning point for us... well, for me. You see, I was so relaxed At the beginning of relationships usually I-I'm very tentative. I just have this dark fear that I'm about to be cut loose. "
"Sam: Frasier... "
"Frasier: Oh, I know, I know. I'm just being so insecure, it's nice to know that I'm on solid ground. "
"Sam: Um, Frasier... "
"Frasier: I'm standing on quicksand, aren't I? "
"Sam: I didn't want to talk about this until later... "
"Frasier: Oh my God "
"Sam: I was just... It's not working out between the two of us. Now, it's not you, it's me. I just don't feel the same way about us anymore. "
"Frasier: But things were going so well. What happened? "
"Sam: Oh, nothing happened. We had a wonderful time together, Frasier, it's just run its course. I'm sorry. "
"Frasier: Oh, well, I'm sorry too. "
"Sam: I hope we can still be friends. "
"Frasier: Oh, yes, I'd like that too. Well, you know, seeing as we're friends and all, I suppose there's no reason we shouldn't stay and enjoy what's sure to be a splendid meal. "
"Sam: Absolutely. "
"Frasier: Great. "
"Waiter: Your first course. "
"Frasier: Ah, thank you. Tell me, how many more courses are there? "
"Waiter: Six, sir. "
"Frasier: Could you bring those all at once? "
"Daphne: Good Lord "
"Martin: What? "
"Daphne: Look at this headline. "
"Martin: 'Martin Crane Dead'. Wu-hu-oo Bet you don't need much coffee after that Gee, fifty eight, poor guy, hardly had a life. "
"Daphne: Handsome fellow, though. "
"Martin: Yeah, multi-millionaire, decorated war hero, wrote a spy novel. 'Survived by his wife, Florence, former Miss. Washington and two sons, Joe, a Marine Corps colonel, and the professional baseball player, Mickey Crane'. [puts paper down] Nothing like starting the day off jealous of a dead guy "
"Frasier: Oh, hello all. "
"Daphne: You were up and out early today. "
"Frasier: Yes, well, I thought like taking a walk. I've got a lot on my mind, I picked up some pastry. "
"Daphne: Well, whatever it is, you'll cheer up when you see these photos from your ski weekend. I admit, I took a peek. [hands them over] I must say, this Sam of yours is quite a catch. She's gorgeous, smart, stylish... "
"Frasier: We broke up last night "
"Daphne: Orange juice, anyone? "
"Martin: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, Fras'. "
"Frasier: Oh, it's all right. It was a mutual decision. Well, a little more mutual on her part than mine. Once she dumped me, I jumped right on board. Anyway, I'll be fine, dad. "
"Martin: Well, that's the spirit, just put it all behind you. "
"Frasier: Exactly. But I must admit, I'm having a little difficulty achieving closure. See, Sam said that her feelings changed for no reason Can't help it might have been something specific about me "
"Martin: Now, hold on, don't try to make this your fault "
"Daphne: Yeah, she's probably telling the truth. If a woman's trying to spare your feelings, she'll give you the old, 'It's not you, it's me'. "
"Frasier: That's exactly what she said "
"Daphne: Waffles, anyone? "
"Martin: Now, you know, Fras', I know you're always looking for an explanation for everything but sometimes there isn't one. "
"Frasier: Yeah, I know dad. It's gonna just drive me crazy. You know, until I know why it ended, I'll just assume it was any number of things about me. My self confidence will be shattered. "
"Martin: Well, you've got two choices here. You can spend days trying to figure it out until it drives you nuts or you can do the smart thing, make a clean break, never talk to her again, and get on with your life. "
"Frasier: You're right, dad, that's exactly what I should do. Thank you. "
"Martin: No problem. "
"Frasier: You know, sometimes you're very insightful. "
"Martin: Well, I've been around the block a few times. So, when are you going to go talk to her? "
"Frasier: Right after my waffles. "
"Frasier: Sam, Sam, what are the chances? You've found my thinking place "
"Sam: Frasier, listen, I'm ten minutes late for a deposition. "
"Frasier: Well, we can walk and talk. "
"Sam: All right. "
"Frasier: Look, you know, I'm loving this new arrangement of ours, I think we being friends thing is going to work out great. "
"Sam: Uh, listen, could you pick up the pace a little? "
"Frasier: Right. So, how've you been? "
"Sam: Frasier, I just saw you last night. "
"Frasier: So you did, and now that you bring up last night... God, you do walk fast... Er, I'm looking for a little clarification. "
"Sam: I told you this has nothing to do with you. "
"Frasier: Yes, but it seems highly unlikely that such a sudden change could have nothing to do with me. I mean, maybe it is something that I did unintentionally. I'm sorry, my fault. You know, something this weekend, maybe? I know I played the piano in the lounge a little too long but who knew General Schwartzkopf was so crazy for show tunes "
"Sam: Frasier, there's nothing I'm not telling you. Sometimes things just end. Please, try to not take it so personally. "
"Frasier: All right. "
"Sam: Right, I really am late, I'll talk to you soon, okay? "
"Frasier: Take care. "
"Frasier: Oh... "
"Man: What's the matter with you? "
"Frasier: That's just it. I don't know "
"Niles: Where is Frasier? He knows we have 'Berveda's', if you're late they give away your table and make you sit in the kitchen with the owner's mother. "
"Martin: What the hell did I do with that remote? Daphne, are you sure you haven't seen it? "
"Daphne: Positive. "
"Martin: They ought to make one with a sensor on it. You get more than twenty feet from the TV, it senses it and starts beeping. Maybe for a deaf person they could make one that has purple smoke coming out of it like some kind of flare system or something. "
"Daphne: Mr. Crane, I'm begging you, you've got to get out of the house more "
"Frasier: Hello all. Oh, Niles, what a pleasant surprise. "
"Niles: Just what Momma Bervada will say when we pull up a chair "
"Frasier: Oh, that's right, dinner, I completely forgot. I took a long walk after work, I'm sorry, Niles. It must have completely slipped my mind. "
"Niles: Yes, well, 'Bervada's' out now. I take it you're still consumed with the Sam situation. "
"Frasier: I was just trying to figure out what happened. "
"Niles: The relationship ended, that's what happened. "
"Frasier: But there's got to be a reason "
"Niles: See, you're fixated. "
"Frasier: I am not fixated That is fixated Dad, what the hell are you doing? "
"Martin: Oh, this is stupid Maybe if I stick together ten chopsticks and put a rubber tip on the end for gripping. "
"Frasier: Oh, hello. "
"Roz: Hi. "
"Daphne: I'll be ready in a sec, Roz. "
"Roz: Oh, it's all right, the movie doesn't start till eight. "
"Frasier: Oh, yes, that's right, I forgot you two had plans. Come on in, Roz. You know, I was wondering... "
"Roz: No I don't know why Sam broke up with you, okay? Just like I didn't know two hours ago. Just like Gil and Bulldog and Miss. Judy from the Arts & Crafts hour didn't know "
"Frasier: It never hurts to ask. Miss. Judy had some real insights before she had to make her popsicle stick run. "
"Martin: I think I'll go to Duke's, watch the game there. "
"Frasier: Oh, wait, wait, everybody, before you scatter. I'd like to ask an enormous favour. In the spirit of, well, self- improvement. I'd like you to tell me in your own words just what exactly about me you find unloveable. "
"Frasier: Wait Wait, my God, it's really for the sake of our future relationships. I mean, it just, I know that you're afraid to hurt my feelings but I can stand a little constructive criticism. Now, come on, please, what do you think are my main faults? "
"Martin: Well, let's start with what you're doing now. You analyse everything to death. Sam said it wasn't your fault but you keep digging around and digging around until you drive everybody nuts. "
"Frasier: Okay. Dad thinks I am over analytical. That's great, we've got the ball rolling, okay, who's next? Niles? "
"Niles: I'm sorry, I'm not entirely sure how useful this exercise is. "
"Frasier: Niles, I don't care how you feel about it, you're going to participate "
"Niles: Pushy. "
"Frasier: Well, yes, if that's what it takes to... Oh, thank you. All right, Daphne, it's your turn, don't be shy. "
"Daphne: Well, if I had to choose, I'd say you are a bit of a fuss budget. "
"Frasier: Fuss budget Well, listen, if you don't mind the substitution, I think maybe 'demanding' is more the mot juste. "
"Daphne: Pretentious. "
"Frasier: Right, you see, this is very good. Roz, you must have something? "
"Roz: Well, you are a little full of yourself. "
"Frasier: Great. Okay, pompous. "
"Roz: And you do tend to ramble on with the callers. "
"Frasier: A tad loquacious. "
"Martin: Pretentious. "
"Frasier: Dad, I all ready wrote that down. "
"Martin: Underline it "
"Niles: Oh, snippy. "
"Daphne: Sarcastic. "
"Martin: Bossy. "
"Niles: Huffy. "
"Roz: Vain. "
"Frasier: Oh, how nice we've finally found an activity we all enjoy together "
"Roz: Oh, come on, Frasier, why don't you just admit what you're doing here. This isn't some 'help-me-be-a-better-person' thing. You're trying to figure out what you can fix so you can win Sam back. "
"Frasier: Oh, now, Roz, that's proposterous. "
"Roz: Look who you're talking to I've been down this road so many times, I call it 'The Roz Expressway'. "
"Niles: I've heard that phrase before but in a slightly different context. "
"Frasier: Well, all right, maybe there is some truth in what you say, I mean, after all, Sam is really quite a catch, why wouldn't I want to get her back? "
"Roz: But you shouldn't change yourself just to please her. It's not healthy, and it doesn't work, and if it did, Steve Wilson would be my husband and not just some name tattoed on my butt "
"Daphne: If you want my advice; the best thing you can do is nothing. Just leave her be to think about what she's missing out on. "
"Roz: I totally agree. No candy, no flowers and what ever you do, don't call. "
"Frasier: Well, I don't see anything wrong with keeping the lines of communication open. "
"Roz: Oh God, you called didn't you? "
"Frasier: Well, maybe I left a carefully worded message. "
"Roz: Oh, Frasier, you never call somebody who's broken up with you. It makes you look desperate. "
"Frasier: Well, I didn't have any choice, she wouldn't return any of my pagers Oh God, I've blown it haven't I? "
"Daphne: Well, that depends. What did you say in your message? "
"Frasier: Well, nothing undignified. Of course, tone of voice is everything, isn't it? You know, maybe I should just play them for you. "
"Roz: Wait, you have her access code for her answering machine? "
"Frasier: Yes, luckily I set it up with her. I gave her an access code that would be easy to remember - my birthday. "
"Martin: What's so easy about May 7th? "
"Frasier: I wouldn't know, dad, my birthday's in March "
"Martin: Oh, that's right. The seventh, that's Eddie "
"Frasier: Okay, okay, here we go. All right, now, listen and tell me if you think I sound desperate. "
"Secretary: Hi, Sam. Two quick things - dinner at L'escalias is not at 8"
":30 and the judge needs to see you at nine tomorrow morning and not ten. Bye. "
"Niles: I didn't get desperate, I got feminine "
"Frasier: Shut up, Niles "
"Frasier: Hello, Sam, it's Frasier. Give me a call, if you get a chance. Bye. "
"Daphne: You don't sound desperate at all. "
"Frasier: Hi, Sam, I forgot to mention I'll be at the office. Call me. It's Frasier. "
"Niles: Well, maybe just a whiff of desperation. "
"Frasier: Hi, I'm at the office now. "
"Frasier: Still at the office. "
"Frasier: I stepped out to the coffee machine. Thought I might have missed you. "
"Niles: How quickly a whiff becomes a stench "
"Frasier: You know, they just get worse after that. "
"Martin: There's more? "
"Frasier: Yes. Not anymore though. There, messages erased. "
"Roz: Hey, your messages were not the only ones on there. What about the one from her secretary about the meeting with the judge? "
"Frasier: Oh, my God, you're right. That did sound important. "
"Roz: So, what are you going to do about it? "
"Frasier: Well, I guess I could just call back and leave a message saying that I inadvertantly erased the message of hers while I was erasing a bunch of other messages that I left earlier. "
"Roz: With her secret access code "
"Frasier: Right Oh, God, this is humiliating. "
"Martin: Now, Frasier, I hate to appear unsupportive, but I've got to get to Duke's for the game. "
"Roz: Yeah, and we're going to be late for that movie. "
"Daphne: Oh, wait, I forgot my purse. "
"Martin: Oh, don't worry about it Frasier. You'll be fine, you'll bounce back. You're tough. "
"Roz: And resourceful. "
"Niles: Resilient. "
"Martin: Optimistic. "
"Niles: Tenacious. "
"Daphne: Conceited. "
"Martin: Different list, Daph' "
"Frasier: It's hard to believe this picture was taken only three days ago. Look at us. How happy I was. Now, I'll never see her again. "
"Niles: Aren't you over dramatising? You're bound to run into her now and then. "
"Frasier: No, I was talking about me and Lesley Stahl. "
"Niles: You know, looking at these photos, I can't help noticing there are very few of you and Sam together. "
"Frasier: What are you getting at? "
"Niles: Well, I'm just wondering how much you really feel for this woman? "
"Frasier: Oh, don't be ridiculous, I haven't felt this way for ages. "
"Niles: I'm sorry. I guess I was wrong. It's love then. "
"Frasier: Well, I don't know about love. We've only been seeing each other for a month. "
"Niles: But you could see yourself falling in love with her? "
"Frasier: Possibly. "
"Niles: Some time down the line? "
"Frasier: Yes, yes, perhaps. "
"Niles: Well, no wonder you're heartbroken. You've just lost the only woman you could even possibly sometime down the line perhaps fall in love with. I'm surprised the country music people haven't jumped all over this one "
"Frasier: Oh, all right, so I don't rhapsodise about her. "
"Niles: No, you did rhapsodise when she took you to 'Le Cigare Volant' and you were seated in a secret VIP room we never knew existed. "
"Frasier: What are you suggesting? That I'm so shallow I was with her mainly for her connections? "
"Niles: I wouldn't put it as harshly as that but let's face it, ever since we were young, you've had a yearning to run with the cool kids and it's never worked out for you. Your one day on the football team? The summer you bought that motorcycle. Although, to be accurate... "
"Frasier: Hey, it's only a moped if you pedal it and I never pedaled "
"Niles: I just wonder if what you're mourning is not so much the loss of Sam, it's the loss of her celebrity lifestyle. "
"Frasier: I must admit things never did seem quite right between us. God, if it hadn't been for her friends, I probably would have broken it off myself. Oh, God, shame on me. "
"Niles: Don't punish yourself, Frasier. At least you're deep enough to realise you're shallow. Dinner? "
"Frasier: Let's. "
"Niles: All right. "
"Frasier: All though, I've still got to phone her about that message. "
"Niles: Oh, you know what. Why don't we stop by 'L'escalias' on our way to dinner. You can just run in and tell her in person. "
"Frasier: Even better God, Niles, I can't tell you helpful this has been. Really, how can I ever repay you? "
"Niles: You can start by getting me into that VIP room in 'Le Cigare Volant' - where is the entrance? By the cigarette machine? "
"Frasier: No, that's just a decoy. It's through the dry cleaner's next door. "
"Niles: No. "
"Frasier: Hello, Sam. "
"Sam: Frasier. "
"Frasier: I know you didn't expect to see me tonight. "
"Sam: Well, of course after all the messages, I'm not totally surprised. "
"Frasier: Oh God, you heard them? "
"Sam: I checked my machine this afternoon. Frasier, I think we really need to talk. "
"Frasier: No, no, we don't. I promise you I will never call you again. I've thought about this and believe me you made the right decision. "
"Sam: No, no, I didn't. "
"Frasier: Excuse me? "
"Sam: Yes. Please, sit down. I was going to call you later anyway. You see, I think I figured out what happened between the two of us. I panicked. You see, I was starting to really care about you. I thought we might even have a future, even, and, well, it scared well. But the way you pursued me, showing up at the courthouse and leaving all of those messages and now you're here. Obviously, you feel just as strongly as I do. It's funny really. The both of us falling in love so fast and not realising the other one felt the same way. We should be laughing. "
"Frasier: Oh, listen, Sam... "
"Sam: No, no, I'm going to tell you what we're going to be doing this weekend. We're taking the concord to London for a party at Alec Guiness' place. "
"Frasier: I'm not so sure that... Sir Alec Guiness? "
"Sam: Yes, well, I know it's a long way to go but Stephen is going to be there, he's promised to play some songs for the new one. "
"Frasier: I don't know... Stephen Sondheim? "
"Sam: Yes, oh, and you'll never guess who'll be singing with him. "
"Frasier: No, please don't tell me, please. "
"Sam: Frasier, what is it? You seem upset. "
"Frasier: Sam, I can't see you anymore. "
"Sam: What? "
"Frasier: I think you're an incredible woman but I've come to a realisation about us, well about me, and I just don't see any future for us. I know it sounds strange after the way I was pursuing you but I... I've been in it for all the wrong reasons. "
"Sam: Like what? "
"Frasier: Well, I'm not very proud of this, but maybe I was a little dazzled by the circle you travel in. "
"Sam: So you were with me just so you could be around some famous people? "
"Frasier: It's not as though I wasn't fond of you as well. "
"Sam: Fond of me? Oh, well, thank you very much. "
"Frasier: But I understand that you're upset and I'm just gonna go. "
"Sam: I don't believe this... my friend "
"Frasier: I know it's shallow and it's something I'm going to have to work on. "
"Lesley: Hi, Sam, how are you? "
"Frasier: Lesley, hello. Dr. Frasier Crane, we met this weekend. "
"Lesley: Oh, are how you? "
"Sam: What kind of sick bastard are you? "
"Frasier: Don't worry, we're just having a little bit of a spat. But, of course, I don't need to tell you, being the ace reporter that you are. "
"Sam: Just get out of here right now "
"Frasier: Right, right, okay. Listen, if you're in town for a while, maybe we can have lunch? "
"Sam: Get out "
"Frasier: What is the matter with me? "
"Frasier: Lesley. "

"Martin: Ow Easy. "
"Masseur: Sorry, your neck is tight. "
"Martin: Yeah, well, it's been a tense couple of days. "
"Masseur: The holidays'll do that to you. "
"Martin: Yeah well, this has been the worst Christmas ever. It all started yesterday... "
"TO: Frasier's Apartment. Martin and Frasier are decorating "
"Martin: You know the only part about Christmas I don't like? How quickly it's all over "
"Frasier: Yes. Come December 26th, it's all just a memory. With nothing but your light decorating touch to remind us. "
"Daphne: Afternoon, all "
"Martin: Oh, hi Daphne "
"Niles: Oh That's awfully dangerous, Daphne, standing there under that mistletoe. "
"Frasier: That's enough eggnog, Niles "
"Daphne: You know, the oddest thing just happened. [Niles takes Daphne's coat, sniffing the fragrances] I was walking Eddie past that church over on Chestnut. And he turned to go inside, like he assumed that was where we were going. "
"Frasier: That's strange He did exactly the same thing with me yesterday when I was walking him. "
"Daphne: Any idea why he would do that, Mr. Crane? "
"Martin: Look, that dog's always doing weird things Yesterday, when we were taking our bath together, Eddie spent fifteen straight minutes pushing the soap around with his nose like an otter. It's weird "
"Frasier: Yes, if he gets any weirder, we'll have to send 'Eddie' to a home. "
"Frasier: Well, I'm off, I've got all my Christmas shopping to do yet. "
"Martin: All of it? "
"Frasier: Yes, well, I'm determined not to settle this year. I want my gifts to be remembered and cherished long after the holidays. "
"Martin: Well, you know, nothing is cherished quite so much as the gift of laughter. "
"Frasier: If you want that 'Highway Patrol Bloopers' tape, you're gonna have to buy it yourself Oh, Dad You're not going to drink that that way, are you? "
"Martin: Why? "
"Frasier: My Goodness, the first mistake in eggnog preparation is failing to garnish it properly with a dash of nutmeg. There we are. "
"Martin: Oh "
"Frasier: Of course, the second mistake is placing the paprika next to the nutmeg on the spice shelf. "
"Daphne: Mr. Crane, are you alright? "
"Frasier: We're fine, Daphne You all right, Dad? "
"Martin: Yeah, I'm fine. Listen Frasier, before you go, can I talk to you for a minute? "
"Frasier: Well sure, what is it? "
"Martin: Well, you know what Daphne was talking about? There is a reason Eddie knows that church. I've been taking him there. "
"Frasier: I guess the family that bathes together prays together. "
"Martin: Well, no. But there's this priest, Father Curtis, he got to know Eddie in the park and he asked if they could use him for the Christmas pageant and I said sure. Well, the next thing I know, he's roped me in to play a shepherd. Well then, Dutch Gaansvort comes down with bronchitis and I get promoted to a wise man... "
"Frasier: Dad, is there a point to this story looming somewhere on the horizon? "
"Martin: As a wise man, I have to sing a song. I said, well that was fine, but this song's a killer. I'm going to humiliate myself "
"Frasier: Oh well, maybe you just need a little rehearsal. Why don't we work on it tonight? "
"Martin: Really? Do you think that would help? "
"Frasier: Sure You're a good singer, you're just a little rusty. Start around eight? "
"Martin: OK. Yeah, I am a good singer Remember those old family picnics when I used to belt out 'What's New, Pussycat'? "
"Frasier: We'll start around seven, then. Niles, hold the elevator "
"Martin: Hey boys, this is that song I was telling you about, 'Oh Holy Night,' do you know it? "
"Frasier: Well, of course Dad, it's a classic. My God, it all builds up to that one glorious note. 'Oh night, de-viiiine, oh...' "
"Martin: Yes, yes, that's the note I can't hit. I practice in my room and Eddie ends up burying his head under the pillow. "
"Niles: Don't worry, Dad, we'll get you there. "
"Martin: All right, can we just can this done? I want to get it all finished before Daphne gets back. I don't want her to know anything about this or she'll insist on coming down to the pageant, and I'm nervous enough as it is. "
"Frasier: Fine. "
"Niles: Let's just see what we have to work with. Why don't you start here, 'Oh night,' and I want to hear you really attack the note. "
"Martin: Oh night, When Christ was born. Oh night di-viiiine "
"Niles: Sometimes the note sees the attack coming and retreats "
"Martin: Shut up This bozo upstairs, he bangs on the floor every time I start to sing. "
"Frasier: Just ignore him, Dad. I tell you what, there is another vocal exercise I remember, it was very useful to me when I was singing Colonel Fairfax in 'Yeoman Of The Guard.' The principal is to distract yourself with a physical exercise, thus freeing the voice. You hit one note and you slide up the octave as you descend slowly into a crouched position. Observe. "
"Frasier: You see? It works. "
"Niles: That's very interesting. I wonder if the reverse is true. "
"Frasier: Try it, Dad. "
"Martin: No, I'm afraid with three of us doing it, it might look stupid. "
"Niles: I'm starting to think your problem is all psychological. No, no, no, I think you've convinced yourself you can't reach the note... "
"Martin: Yeah, I've convinced the guy upstairs too "
"Frasier: No, I think Niles may be right, Dad. You just need some positive reinforcement. Let's try it again. This time, try to eliminate any negative thoughts. Let's go again, Niles, 'Fall on your knees.' "
"Martin: 'Fall on your knees...' "
"Frasier: I hear sweet music "
"Martin: 'Oh, hear the angels' voices...' "
"Niles: I hear one angel "
"Martin: 'Oh, night divine...' "
"Frasier: Something's divine "
"Niles: Yeah, Dad "
"Martin: 'Oh night, when Christ was born...' "
"Frasier: A star is born "
"Martin: 'Oh, night...' "
"Frasier: Bring it home now "
"All: Oh, shut up "
"TO: "
"Masseur: Your shoulders are awfully tight. "
"Daphne: Yeah, it's been a stressful few days. "
"Masseur: I'd be happy to listen. "
"Daphne: Oh, no... well, it started yesterday. I had something on my mind. Lucky for me, Dr. Crane's brother was over. He's always been such a good friend to me... "
"TO: replay of Scene "
"One: the scene is set the same way as "
"Daphne: Afternoon, all "
"Martin: Oh, hi Daphne "
"Niles: Oh, that's awfully dangerous, Daphne, standing under that mistletoe. A piece could fall into your eye. "
"Frasier: Let me freshen your drink, Niles "
"Daphne: Thank you, Dr. Crane. The oddest thing just happened. [Niles takes Daphne's coat] I was walking Eddie past that church over on Chestnut, and he turned to go inside, like he assumed that was where we were going. "
"Frasier: That's strange He did exactly the same thing yesterday when I was walking him. "
"Daphne: Any idea why he would do that, Mr. Crane? "
"Martin: Nope Dogs are weird "
"Daphne: You know, that worries me a bit. "
"Niles: What does? "
"Daphne: Well, I think your father's been going to that church. I had an uncle who did the same thing. He had no interest in church his whole life. Then he started going everyday. It turns out he had some bad health news from his doctor. He didn't even last a year. "
"Niles: Well, first of all, I can see you're upset, so come here. "
"Daphne: Thank you, Dr. Crane, you're always so supportive "
"Niles: And second of all, I think you're worrying over nothing. I've never known my father to have so much as a hangnail without letting everyone know about it. "
"Daphne: That's true. Maybe I just got myself worked up remembering my Uncle John. "
"Niles: Look at you, just saying his name gets you upset. Come here. "
"Daphne: Well, I'm fine "
"Niles: No, no, you need a hug. "
"Daphne: Oh, all right. "
"Daphne: Mr. Crane, are you alright? "
"Frasier: We're... fine, Daphne. "
"Niles: See, nothing to worry about. Well, I have got to run. "
"Frasier: Oh, hold the elevator, Niles See you soon, Daphne. "
"Daphne: Bye "
"Frasier: And, uh, Dad? Listen, don't worry. We'll... Niles and I will... be there for you. "
"Daphne: What's that about? "
"Martin: Oh, never mind Well, I gotta go lie down. "
"Daphne: Mr. Crane, did you ever call Dr. Stuart, for the results of your physical? "
"Martin: Em, sure, couple of days ago. "
"Daphne: And? "
"Martin: Em, fine. Come on, Eddie. "
"Daphne: Is everything all right? "
"Martin: Oh yeah. It's just all over so fast "
"Daphne: Well, that was enough to convince me I was right. And the next 24 hours were a living hell The worst came the next day... "
"TO: "
"Martin: Well, you know, I'm terrified about this, Father. All this came around so sudden. I'm not prepared. Now tell me again what I'm supposed to say when I see Jesus the first time? OK. All right. Well, thank you. Yeah, see you soon, bye. "
"Martin: Oh hi, Daphne "
"Daphne: Hello I'm just so excited about the gift I just got for you, Mr. Crane. "
"Martin: Oh, great "
"Daphne: Why don't you open it now? "
"Martin: Oh, I'd love to, but to tell you the truth, I don't really have much time, I'm kind of on my way out. [Daphne begins to cry] Oh, OK, all right I'll open it now, sure, sure. I don't want to get you upset You must be really excited about this "
"Martin: Oh, wow It's that sweater The one I pointed out to you in that window It's great Boy, I can die a happy man now Daphne, what's the matter, are you all right? "
"Daphne: Oh, Mr. Crane, I know why you've been going down to that church "
"Martin: You do? Well, you're not supposed to know about that But why is it making you so upset? "
"Daphne: Because I care about you You were actually going to let this whole thing happen without ever telling a soul "
"Martin: Well, yes I-I don't want people staring at me in church, stiff as a board, all that makeup on my face. "
"Daphne: So... how much time have you got? "
"Martin: Uh, about twenty minutes. "
"Daphne: Twenty minutes? "
"Martin: Yeah, and boy, will I be glad when it's all over. This is the last Christmas pageant I'm ever signing up for "
"Daphne: You're in a Christmas pageant? "
"Martin: Well, yeah What did you think I was talking about? "
"Daphne: I thought you were dying "
"Martin: What? "
"Daphne: Well, you'd just got your test results back, you're down at the church all the time. Why are you laughing? "
"Martin: Well, it's funny "
"Daphne: I don't think it's so bloody funny "
"Martin: Are you kidding? Oh, I'm dying "
"Daphne: You will be "
"Martin: What are you doing? Daphne, don't do that "
"TO: "
"Masseur: You can talk about it if you like. "
"Niles: Oh, I'm not ready just yet. "
"Time: (10"
":55) "
"Niles: Oh, I can't tell you how good that feels. I don't think I've ever had a massage like this before "
"Daphne: Well, I'm glad. As long as you're so relaxed, maybe I should just give you your Christmas present right now. "
"Niles: OW You woke me up "
"Masseur: Sorry, I guess this ankle's a bit tender. "
"Niles: Well, yours would be too if you'd had the day I had... "
"TO: the Elliot Bay Towers "
"lobby: Niles is waiting for the "
"Niles: I'd gone out to do some shopping, then I arrived at Frasier's building. "
"Niles: Excuse me. I'm sorry, I don't mean to crowd you. This is a brand-new, hand-tailored Italian suit. You know how difficult it is to get sap out of silk. "
"Albert: Another reason we didn't need this tree. "
"Jane: Oh, Albert "
"Albert: This thing's a fire hazard. "
"Niles: You know, they make a chemical now that you can use to fireproof a tree. "
"Albert: It causes cancer. "
"Niles: Happy Holidays, then. "
"Jane: What just happened? "
"Doris: I think the elevator's stopped. "
"Niles: Well, not to worry, I'm sure we'll get it going in a moment. "
"Albert: We've probably got about twenty minutes of oxygen. "
"Niles: Sir, you're just going to alarm everyone. "
"Doris: I work in an ER. "
"Niles: Ah Well, perhaps you can instruct these people on the best way to stay cool in a crisis. "
"Doris: I was on duty that night the elevator cable snapped at the Bing building. And they brought those people in on cookie sheets. "
"Niles: Hello, is anyone there? "
"Repairman: Yeah, who is it? "
"Niles: There's a group of us stuck in one of your elevators. The doors won't open and we can't seem to move off the 8th floor. "
"Repairman: All right, where are you calling from, sir? "
"Niles: The Elliot Bay Towers. "
"Repairman: Well, both my crews are out, it could be a good hour-and- a-half before I could get anybody there. "
"Doris: But I can't wait that long, my children are alone upstairs in the apartment "
"Albert: You haven't got a gas oven up there, have you? "
"Repairman: Well, there is another way. If somebody felt like climbing through the trap door on top of your car, there's a manual release switch up there that would open up your doors. "
"Doris: Well, that's what we've gotta do then, somebody's gotta go up there. "
"Albert: Uhhh, that's a pretty small opening. "
"Niles: Well obviously, I have more confidence in your wife than you do. Step this way, ma'am, I'll give you a leg up. "
"Doris: It has to be you. "
"Niles: Well, uh, I'd have - how do you expect me to get up there? "
"Doris: Well, you can climb up the tree. "
"Niles: Oh, come on. "
"Doris: Well now, surely you climbed plenty of trees when you were a boy. "
"Jane: That's Dr. Crane's brother. "
"Doris: Oh... "
"Niles: Fine. I suppose in times of crisis, someone must step forward and be a hero. "
"Niles: Today that man is Niles Crane Tomorrow, it will be my dry cleaner, Mr. Lee. "
"Albert: All right, come on now, grab his feet and we'll push him through. "
"Niles: No, no, wait, not so fast "
"Niles: No, not to worry, I landed in a nice, soft puddle of grease. I just have to find the release switch, bear with me... "
"Doris: Quick "
"Niles: Did that do anything? People? Where'd you all go? "
"Niles: Oh my God We're going up Someone stop this thing "
"TO: the 19th Floor. The elevator doors open, and Niles and "
"Niles: Ow... "
"Hall: Why is that man crawling? Man In "
"Hall: That's Dr. Crane's brother. "
"Hall: Oh... "
"Niles: I was slightly shaken by what I had done, but I'd completely composed myself as I arrived at Frasier's. But it was some time later that I was able to tell them what had happened... "
"TO: that "
"night: Niles is sitting on the sofa with Daphne, "
"Niles: Of course, I have no idea what you use to get elevator grease out of silk "
"Frasier: Well, brown suede seems to leaching it out nicely [doorbell sounds] Anyway, no Christmas is complete without a bit of tumult. But now we can all relax and enjoy a lovely holiday evening together. "
"Roz: Merry Christmas "
"TO: "
"Roz: You sure you wanna hear about this? "
"Masseur: Why not? "
"Roz: OK. Well, I've been feeling a little depressed lately, because I've been putting on all this weight, I'm pregnant... "
"TO: "
"Roz: Hey, guys That's a nice suit. "
"Niles: Well, thank you. It's brand new, and so since you'll probably be ordering food, I think I'll just go, rather than risk getting it stained. "
"Roz: What is that supposed to be? Some kind of crack about how much I eat? "
"Niles: Absolutely not, it was a crack about your table manners. "
"Martin: Well, I should go too. I just got a couple of hours before the pageant and I need the time to rehearse. "
"Frasier: Oh, not to worry, Dad. Come tomorrow, it'll all be a memory. "
"Martin: Yeah, but even after it's all over, I still have to make peace with the man upstairs "
"Roz: So, Frasier, are you sure we have to do this charity thing this afternoon? "
"Frasier: Oh, come on, Roz. It's just an hour out of your life Besides, I think you're gonna make an adorable Mrs. Claus. "
"Roz: Why? Because now I look so much like her, because I've gotten so fat? "
"Frasier: Hello? Why, yes, Mrs. Doyle, yes, she is. Just a moment. It's your mom, they forwarded her from the office. "
"Roz: Hello, Mom? Yes, I got your message. Yep, I'm picking you up at the airport, 10 AM. Right, I'm looking forward to seeing you, too. Bye "
"Frasier: Oh, wait, wait, let me say 'Merry Christmas' "
"Roz: Hang on, Mom "
"Frasier: Mrs. Doyle Yes, Frasier again. Hi, happy holidays Uh, listen, just a word to the "
"wise: Roz has put on quite a few pregnancy pounds of late, and she's really sensitive about it. So, you know, I would just say be careful what you say to her, alright? Bye- bye, yes, we'll see you soon, bye "
"Roz: You know, Frasier, I think I'll meet you over there. I still have a couple of gifts to get "
"Frasier: Oh, God I still have all of mine to get. You know, no matter how hard I try, I just can't seem to find anything that seems quite right this year "
"Roz: Oh, it's really sweet how you're trying to make all your gifts special. I'm sorry I've been so cranky, I'm just nervous about my mom coming. I'm sort of just dreading the big conversation where I finally tell her I'm pregnant. "
"Frasier: You mean you haven't told her yet? "
"Roz: No, it's just not the type of thing you blurt out over the phone "
"Roz: Well, I'll let you get that. I'll see you over there. "
"Frasier: Right. Hello? Yes, I had a feeling you might call back "
"TO: Scene Eight - Shopping Mall "
"Frasier: Oh, Roz There you are, I was beginning to worry about you. "
"Roz: Well, you should have I am on the verge of a complete breakdown Shopping was a disaster And when I went to slip into this darling little costume, my pants split. "
"Frasier: Oh "
"Roz: And on top of all that, I can't stop thinking about my mom How am I going to tell her? "
"Frasier: Well, Roz, if you'd like, I could tell her for you. "
"Roz: Are you kidding? She's gonna be mad enough that I waited three months to tell her, the only thing worse would be to hear it from someone else "
"Frasier: Well, it's entirely possible she already knows. "
"Roz: No way, the only person who knows she's spoken to is you- Oh my God Frasier "
"Frasier: OK Ho-ho-ho, who's first? "
"Roz: What is wrong with you? I'm going to kill you "
"Sally: You're going to kill Santa? "
"Frasier: No, little girl, Mrs. Claus just wants to kiss me. "
"Roz: Yeah, I'll kiss you. Come 'ere, I'll kiss you good Are you insane? "
"Frasier: Roz, you tell your mother everything, how was I supposed to know? "
"Frasier: Ho-ho-ho. "
"Billy: Hi Santa, I want a pony for Christmas. "
"Roz: You got it, now beat it "
"Billy: Mommy, Mommy, I'm gonna get a pony "
"Frasier: Can't we talk about this later? "
"Roz: No, we can't "
"Vic: Hi, Santa. "
"Roz: Oh My God What are you, twenty? Get outta here [Vic leaves] "
"Frasier: Roz, will you just try to stay calm? "
"Roz: No, I will not stay calm Because I am not calm, I am completely freaked I am pregnant, and you told my crazy mother, and my Christmas is ruined, and I'm too fat to even be Mrs. Santa, and I hate this holiday "
"Frasier: Mrs. Claus was up very late last night. "
"TO: Scene Nine - Frasier's Apartment "
"Roz: Of course I still had to stop by Frasier's, I had to give him his champagne glasses. ' Frasier once again goes after "
"Frasier: Roz, don't go Come on, look, I'm sorry about what happened, but it was a mistake, you can't stay mad at me. "
"Roz: I still have to face my mother tomorrow "
"Frasier: Well, we can talk about that. Come on in. Please, come in? Look, how would it look if I turned a pregnant lady away on Christmas Eve when there's so much room here at the inn? "
"Frasier: Niles, Daphne, Roz is here "
"Daphne: Hi. "
"Roz: Hi. "
"Frasier: Oh, come on, people Let's liven things up a little, it's Christmas Eve What are the Cranes known for if not their legendary holiday spirit? "
"Martin: I hate singing and I hate Christmas and I'm going to bed "
"Frasier: Dad, what happened? "
"Martin: Well, I went into my song and everything was going fine. Then we come up to the high note, and I actually think I'm going to hit it for once. Then I look over and I see Eddie. He's got his head buried in the Christ Child's cradle Well, I guess he mistook the Christ Child for one of his chew toys because he grabs a hold of it inis teeth and starts shaking it So, the Virgin Mary grabbed hold of its legs, well, you know how Eddie likes a good tug-of-war, so they're going at it, then Eddie runs out of there with it still in his mouth and half the population of Bethlehem chasing after him I never should have agreed to be in that pageant "
"Daphne: You would have saved me a lot of grief "
"Martin: Oh, don't start this again "
"Niles: Don't you talk to her like that "
"Frasier: Now come on everybody, let's not say something we're going to regret "
"Roz: Oh, you're one to talk "
"Until: "
"Frasier: This is the night we celebrate peace and togetherness I will not have that ruined I intend to put us all in the right frame of mind, by giving you all my gift. As you know, I was determined to make my gifts this year a little more meaningful. And after a great deal of effort I believe I have. My gift does not come from some fancy store, all wrapped in glittery paper, my gift comes from my heart. Tonight, I intend to sit each one of you down, and tell you in my own words, exactly how much you mean to me. "
"is: 'That's ' "
"Frasier: Or, I could get someone over to give us all massages. "

"Frasier: I specifically requested my macaroni & cheese al denté. Young "
"Niles: I know. This lunch is a culinary Hindenberg. "
"Frasier: Niles, have you ever considered that our food may be payback for your recent editoral, 'Cafeteria Of Shame'? Young "
"Niles: Well, they can't intimidate me. They'll never silence my pen. I could write an exposé on their baked goods alone. "
"Frasier: Yes, this is the hardest roll since Hamlet Young "
"Niles: Good one, Frasier. May I use it? "
"Frasier: But of course. "
"Niles: These biscotti represent an all-time low. Chalky aftertaste, inelegant aroma, spongy "
"Frasier: Yes, and what is a spongy biscotti but an unwelcome trespasser into Madeline territory? "
"Niles: Have you seen how stale these pistachios are? It's like swallowing gravel. It's a wonder I escaped permanent injury. "
"Frasier: Yes, your ability to cheat death at every turn never ceases to amaze. "
"Niles: Someone's in a mood today. "
"Frasier: Yes, sorry Niles. You know sometimes you just find yourself getting restless? "
"Niles: I'm fearing I'm about to. "
"Niles: Hello. Yes? Really? Bravo Excellenté Benissimo You'll never guess who that was "
"Frasier: The Three Tenors? "
"Niles: No, it was my antiques scout. The present I ordered for Maris's birthday has arrived. I got her the most exquisite antique saddle. "
"Frasier: Oh. How's it look on you? "
"Niles: You won't laugh when you see it. It is bejewelled but not overdone, much like my Maris. The craftsmanship is breathtaking. It's been so expertly restored you can barely see the stitching. "
"Frasier: Again, like Maris "
"Niles: Someone is in a mood today. I'll get this. "
"Frasier: Thank you Niles, it's... perhaps you can run along to the wine club on your own tonight. "
"Niles: What? "
"Frasier: Well, it'll just be the same old faces rehashing the same boring topics. "
"Niles: You're more upset than I realised. Let's do something to take your mind off it. Dinner? Chamber music? There's a wonderful lecture series on the histroy of modern lecture series. "
"Frasier: I'm sorry, I don't think so. You know, I just feel like being on my own tonight. You don't mind, do you? "
"Niles: Of course not, I'll just see you at Puchino for lunch tomorrow. "
"Frasier: Well maybe we ought to play that by ear as well. "
"Niles: As you wish. "
"Frasier: You're not upset, are you? "
"Niles: Frasier, I'd have to have a pretty fragile ego to be upset just because you want to take some time away from me. "
"Waiter: Do you want to pay? "
"Niles: Separate checks, please "
"Martin: Alright. Here we "
"go: cold cuts, pizza rolls, deviled eggs, pork roll-ups; all right. "
"Frasier: Yes, the ideal buffet for a group of heavyset men over sixty I assume everyone's ready to order. "
"Martin: Well, we're about ready to start our poker game. "
"Daphne: Don't worry Mr. Crane, I'll be on my way in a minute. "
"Martin: OK. Well, we're about ready to start our poker game. "
"Frasier: I heard you, dad. I'm just trying to figure out what I'm going to do with myself this evening. My old routine doesn't seem to satisfy me anymore, I'm trying to think of something new. Oh, I know - maybe I could join you and the guys for some cards, eh? "
"Martin: Oh, I don't know about that, Frasier; I just don't think you'd fit in "
"Frasier: Why not? Roz is playing "
"Martin: Roz is like one of the guys. She knows more dirty jokes than Duke "
"Frasier: Oh, if that's the criteria, I'm sure I could tell you a tale or two which would make you blush like a school girl. "
"Martin: That's what I'm afraid of "
"Daphne: Oh let him play, it can't hurt anything. "
"Martin: Alright, come on. "
"Martin: Guys, Frasier's going to sit in with us tonight. "
"Roz: Really? You're going to play with us. "
"Frasier: Why not, Roz? Don't look so surprised. 'Sides, there's nothing I enjoy more than a good old-fashioned night with the guys. "
"Frank: OK, get ready, seven buck limit high and low, chips to win, high and low, the wheel is no good. "
"Frasier: Perfect. "
"Leo: No Check in rays? Three buck limit. "
"Frasier: Sounds good. "
"Roz: You're lost, aren't you? "
"Frasier: Like a Bedouin in a sandstorm "
"Leo: So, you guys got your all-weather tires on ya? "
"Frank: I'm going to Richie's for some bodywork afterwards. "
"Roz: Go to Tim's, you get free a overhaul. "
"Duke: You ever been to Hank's? Now there's a garage. "
"Martin: King bets, fifty cents. Yeah, I've been to Hank's, right next to Mike's Hardware, right? "
"Jimmy: Why I was in Mike's the other day, they got those new cordless drills. "
"Frank: Still go to Mike's? You ought to try Tommy's. They give away free battery testers with every purchase. "
"Frasier: I'm out "
"Frasier: Well, that was a bust "
"Daphne: Be glad before the debate begins over who would be the most fun on a desert island - Angie Dickinson or Ursula Andress? "
"Frasier: That's ludicrous... it's Angie Dickinson. "
"Daphne: You know, Dr. Crane, I know it's none of my business but... Oh, never mind. "
"Frasier: No, no, go ahead. "
"Daphne: Perhaps you've been feeling restless lately because of a lack of, well, you know, female companionship. So I thought... "
"Frasier: Oh, dear "
"Daphne: Just listen. I'm meeting my friend Clare for drinks tonight - she's complained of feeling restless... "
"Frasier: Just stop right there. I think by now you'd know my policy on fix-up's. "
"Daphne: She's pretty, she's lonely and she's an underwear model. "
"Frasier: So you do know my policy. Off we go "
"Daphne: Say hello to the 'Fox & Whistle.' "
"Frasier: You point her out and I will "
"Winston: Hi-ay love, give us a kiss "
"Frasier: Hope he's talking to you. "
"Daphne: Evening, all "
"Clare: Daphne "
"Daphne: There's Clare now. "
"Frasier: My, she's everything you said she was... "
"Clare: I'm engaged "
"Frasier: And more "
"Daphne: When did this happen? "
"Clare: Well, my old boyfriend, Bob, surprised me two nights ago. You gotta meet him, he's right over there. "
"Clare: He even brought someone you might be interested in. "
"Daphne: Oh, he is nice looking, isn't he? "
"Clare: Coming, pookie. "
"Daphne: Oh sorry, Dr. Crane, it seems like I've brought you down here for nothing. "
"Frasier: Oh hardly. If not for you I would have missed seeing the World's Most Nauseating Couple defend their title. "
"Daphne: We can leave if you like. "
"Frasier: No, no, you go talk with your friend; I'll have a drink. "
"Daphne: You sure? "
"Frasier: Sure. "
"Winston: What d'ya need? "
"Frasier: Well, funny, I've been asking myself that same question all day, it seems that lately my life... "
"Winston: I'll come back. "
"Frank: I forgot that story "
"Martin: Oh geez, it still doesn't top the time Leo and I were sent to break up that fight in the strip joint. "
"Leo: Oh, boy "
"Martin: We walked in there and I'm telling you there was this one girl... "
"Frank: Hey Marty, Marty Maybe you shouldn't tell that story. "
"Martin: What, because of Roz? "
"Roz: Oh please, Frank If I can handle the Angie/Ursula debate, I think I can handle this "
"Leo: But you agree with me on that one, right? You said you'd rather sleep with Angie? "
"Roz: One more time Leo. If I had to choose, yes "
"Martin: Hey Leo, you start telling them that strip joint story; you guy's are going to bust a gut Anyone else need a beer? "
"Roz: Yes "
"Martin: Roz? "
"Roz: Remember? "
"Martin: Oh geez, I'm sorry, I forgot, yeah "
"Frank: What's the matter, Roz? You think you won't be able to control yourself with all these handsome guys here? "
"Roz: It's a little late for that, Frank. I'm pregnant. "
"Frank: What? That's great I remember when my Annie was pregnant. There is nothing more beautiful than a pregnant broad "
"Leo: You're in for a real treat, Roz. The best thing I ever did was having kids. "
"Duke: You know from the moment you hold that brand new baby in your arms, your whole life changes. "
"Jimmy: You're right about that "
"Frank: What about when they grab your fingers with those little hands, that's one of the greatest feelings there ever is. "
"Duke: Yeah the joy of seeing them look up at you and smile. "
"Jimmy: Cherish every moment, Roz. "
"Frank: He's right. One minute they're sitting on your lap; you're their whole world. Next "
"thing: they're growing up, out of the door with lives of their own "
"Leo: And it's just you, old and alone in an empty house. "
"Duke: It's so empty. "
"Martin: Leo, I don't think you told that story right "
"Clare: I think that Steven likes you "
"Daphne: I hope so. He's adorable. I must say I was flattered when he assumed I was an underwear model too. "
"Clare: I noticed you didn't rush to correct him. "
"Daphne: There'll be time for that after the wedding Ah, maybe I should just tell Dr. Crane to run along home. "
"Clare: I'm surprised you even brought your boss down here, I couldn't never relax around mine. What if he took a liking to the place? "
"Daphne: Oh that's nothing I have to worry about, this pub really isn't his style "
"Gang: Zing, boom, tararrel Ring out a song of good cheer It's time to roll out the barrel Coz the gangs all here "
"Frasier: Daphne, come and sing a song with us "
"Daphne: Well, actually... "
"Frasier: Oh, you're not shy about singing in the house. "
"Steven: You two live together? "
"Frasier: Yes She's my dad's health care worker. "
"Steven: I thought you modeled underwear "
"Frasier: No Only if her robes aren't stitched up tight enough "
"Terrence: Come on Frasier, we're going to do 'Knees Up Mother Brown'. "
"Frasier: I don't know 'Knees Up Mother Brown'. I know what, let's bring some sheet music tomorrow night. "
"Daphne: Tomorrow? "
"Frasier: Yes. "
"Daphne: But you can't I mean... do you know you have that gallery opening tomorrow? "
"Frasier: No, but if you hum a few bars I'll try to pick it up "
"Time: 9"
":12) "
"Martin: Hey Sherry, Daphne's finally clearing out for the night. Why don't you come over? I'll, er, you know, get a fire going, open a bottle of bubbly, put a little Bobby Darin on the stereo, and then look out, Mackie's back in town Yes, I thought it up before I called you. What's the difference? OK, see you soon. Wow, Daphne, don't you look beautiful. "
"Daphne: Thank you. It's so nice to finally have my pub back again. At least for a night. "
"Martin: Yeah. "
"Daphne: You are sure Dr. Crane has plans? "
"Martin: Oh, yeah, Niles called; they're going to the opera. "
"Daphne: Let's hope it's one of those long German ones - I don't want him showing up for last call "
"Martin: Right "
"Frasier: Good evening, Daphne. Wow, you look smashing "
"Daphne: Oh thanks, I'm was just on my way out. "
"Frasier: What, to the 'Fox & Whistle'? I'll go with you Let me just grab me mack and me brolly and Bob's your uncle "
"Daphne: But wait I thought you were going to the opera with your brother? "
"Frasier: That's tomorrow night. Gee, I hope Winston's at the pub - I owe him five quid from the other night "
"Daphne: Suddenly I'm not feeling so well. "
"Frasier: Oh, really? I hope it's not that flu that's going around. "
"Daphne: I think I'll just stay home tonight. "
"Frasier: Yes, yes, that's probably for the best. You've got to be careful what you bring down to the pub with you. "
"Daphne: Tell me about it "
"Frasier: Hello, Niles. "
"Niles: Frasier. "
"Frasier: Something the matter? "
"Niles: Oh, I had a rough night last night. "
"Frasier: How so? "
"Niles: Oh, I gave Maris her birthday saddle. She was so thrilled she treated me to a little Lady Godiva impression. "
"Frasier: Oh, my "
"Niles: Apparently the oils in the saddle reacted badly with her cellulite cream and created a powerful epoxy. "
"Frasier: Oh, dear "
"Niles: Yes, it took an hour and a full bottle of nail polish remover to get her free. Today her poor little thighs were so sore the only way she could find comfort was to straddle a frozen butterball turkey. The only thing that cheered me up all day was the thought of our box at the opera tonight. "
"Frasier: Well, that's tomorrow night, Niles. "
"Niles: No, no, it's tonight. I have the tickets right here. "
"Frasier: Oh, no. "
"Niles: Is there a problem? "
"Frasier: Well yes, there's a billiard tournament at the pub tonight. "
"Niles: You're passing up 'Orpheus & Eurydice' to shoot pool at some sticky-bear salon? "
"Frasier: Yeah well, my partner, Terrence has agreed to skip a family wedding just to participate - I can't leave him in the lurch. Isn't there somebody else who could take my place? "
"Niles: At this point I just so need to be by myself. My brother has abandoned me, my wife is cursing my name. Tonight when Orpheus descends into hell, I'll be there waiting for him with a fruit basket "
"Frasier: Oh, Niles You can't stay mad at me, I promise I'll make it up to you. Press for the lift, won't you? Don't look at me that way, that's what they call it "
"Daphne: Why is it so bloody dark in here? It's bad enough I have to stay home all evening, I'm not going blind as well "
"Martin: What? You're staying in tonight? "
"Daphne: I don't have much choice, since that son of yours decided to go to my pub again. I mean, imagine being so dense that he can completely ruin someone else's evening and not even be aware of it. This wax is dripping "
"Martin: Have you tried maybe dropping a hint? [pops open the champagne loudly] "
"Daphne: Oh believe me, I've dropped plenty; they go right over his head Oh, I'll have a glass of that "
"Martin: Daphne, I've got to level with "
"you: Sherry's coming over and I really hoped to have the place to myself tonight. You know, I really think you should talk to Frasier, and I'm not just saying this because I want you to get the hell out of here It's your pub and you ought to tell him that he's got to find his own place. "
"Daphne: I can't say that "
"Martin: Well the longer you let it go, the more attached he's going to get to that place. "
"Daphne: But he's my boss. "
"Martin: But it's your pub. "
"Daphne: OK. That's it, I'm going to talk to him. "
"Martin: Good for you. "
"Martin: Hello? No, Maris, sorry, you just missed him. Why are you teeth chattering? You're kidding me. Can't you just use the defroster? "
"Frasier: Gee Terrence, I never dreamed we'd be eliminated from the tournament in the first round. Guess I'm a little rustier than I thought. Hey, maybe you can still make that wedding reception. "
"Terrence: It's in Liverpool "
"Frasier: Well then, these are on me. "
"Daphne: Dr. Crane, I have to talk to you. "
"Frasier: By all means, Daphne. Oh, Winston, let's have one of these pints for Miss Moon, please. Oh, this is a really nice surprise, Daphne, you must be feeling better. Here we are. You make a toast. "
"Daphne: I don't want you coming down here ever again "
"Frasier: Well, I guess 'here's mud in your eye' sounded mean the first time too "
"Daphne: I'm sorry if that sounds a bit harsh, but I don't know what else to do. This pub is where I come to get away from things - including my job - and you are my boss... "
"Frasier: Daphne, I'm so sorry. "
"Daphne: I know that must sound selfish. "
"Frasier: No, no, not at all. You know, back in Boston I had a bar like this one, I certainly understand what it's like to have a place where you can get away. So, we've just got one "
"solution: This is your bar, I'll just go. "
"Daphne: I do appreciate this, Dr. Crane. I know you've made friends here too. "
"Frasier: I've only been coming here a week - you've got a history here "
"Daphne: They've become like family to me. "
"Frasier: Yes, I'll just settle up and go. "
"Freddy: Hey, I haven't been gone that long - two months is all. [to "
"Daphne:] Who's this pretty new girl? "
"Winston: Oh, that's Daphne. She's Clare's friend. She's only been coming in the last month or so. "
"Frasier: A month? "
"Daphne: Hello. Well, I'll see you at home, Dr. Crane. "
"Frasier: You've only been coming down here for a month? "
"Daphne: That's still longer than you "
"Frasier: Yes, well there's certainly no way I'm leaving now "
"Daphne: What? "
"Frasier: Daphne, this bar has filled up a void in my life. I'm not just going to throw that away just because you beat me here by a fortnight "
"Daphne: Stop talking like us "
"Winston: Here, here, I don't know what you two are arguing about, but we settle things around here with a quick game of cricket. "
"Frasier: Darts? "
"Winston: Yeah, rules are on the board. "
"Daphne: There's gotta be a better way than that. "
"Frasier: Oh I don't know. It's decisive, better than standing around here bickering. "
"Daphne: It's not exactly my game. "
"Frasier: Well, it's not mine either. "
"Daphne: Well, alright. Let's try it. "
"Frasier: You shoot first, Daphne. You know, I'm rather proud of "
"us: two people in conflict, we've found a civilised way to settle it. "
"Frasier: Oh, my "
"Daphne: Is that good? "
"Frasier: Quite good. "
"Daphne: Lucky shot, then. "
"Frasier: Daphne, If I didn't know better, I'd think you were trying to hustle me "
"Daphne: Oh, not at all. I may have played a game or two of feathers in my day. "
"Frasier: A game or two? You've just made about the most difficult shot on the board "
"Daphne: Actually, that's only the second most difficult. "
"Daphne: That's the most difficult. "
"Frasier: Come to think of it, there might have been a dart board in that bar in Boston... "
"Daphne: Well look at that, it's all tied up "
"Frasier: Yes, who would have guessed those hands are so skilled. Certainly no one who's sampled your corned beef hash [throws "
"shot:] Ha I score again "
"Daphne: That's not something we hear out of your mouth very often "
"Frasier: You don't want to rush this. [Daphne loses her concentration] A lot riding on this shot. [She loses it again] "
"Daphne: There is such a thing as sportsmanship. "
"Frasier: Oh, really? This from a woman who made armpit noises during my last round "
"Daphne: Sod "
"Frasier: I am so sorry, Daphne Now all I have to do is make this relatively simple shot - unless of course you'd like to concede defeat. "
"Daphne: That's typical American arrogance. We Brits don't know the meaning of the word 'defeat' "
"Frasier: Oh really, then I suppose you're not acquainted with that little spat we refer to as the Revolutionary War "
"Daphne: Oh, just like a Yank Insulting us Brits to cover up your inferiority complex "
"Frasier: What exactly should we feel inferior about, your pioneering work in the field of soccer hooliganism? "
"Daphne: Oh, say your worst. We both know there isn't as much dignity in this entire country as our Queen's got in her little finger. "
"Frasier: Oh yes, you've really bested me there, what could be more dignified than a dainty old sandbag who wears a flowerpot on her head I win The bar is mine "
"Frasier: Oh, lose the long faces, lads, I'm staying. Oh good Lord, I hope you didn't take those little barbs about the motherland seriously "
"Terrence: Perhaps you'd better leave now. "
"Frasier: Oh, Daphne'll tell you there's no greater Anglophile than I. I have all my suits made at Savile Row. I spell 'colour' with a 'u' "
"Frasier: Hello, Niles. "
"Niles: Well, look who's here. Take a wrong turn on the way to the pub? "
"Frasier: Actually, that scene has grown tiresome, and I... I miss this place. "
"Niles: I've spoken to Daphne. I take it it's over over there. "
"Frasier: You don't have to rub it in. Anyway, I know I owe you an apology for the other night so, here. I've brought you a peace offering. "
"Niles: 'Orpheus & Eurydice', thank you Frasier. The Glyndeborne production I don't have this one. "
"Frasier: You're going to love it The choice is particularly moving, and Janet Baker's Act Three aria is... "
"Frasier: -is quite simply it's the best consecutive aria I've ever heard. Young "
"Niles: Oh thank you, Frasier. I don't have 'Orpheus & Eurydice' on 8-track yet I'm surprised to see you - No woodworking club today? "
"Frasier: Oh, to tell you the truth, I've grown tired of that crowd, with their stupid bookends and birdhouses. As soon as I've finished slacking my shoe trees I'm out of there. Young "
"Niles: You got thrown out, didn't you? "
"Frasier: I did not. Young "
"Niles: Frasier, I can see right through you. "
"Frasier: Are you a psychiatrist? Young "
"Niles: Oh no, I'm not a psychiatrist but I can see it in your face... "

"Niles: Oh, I got your message about the wine club, Friday night, and yes, I will be there. "
"Frasier: Oh, good, Dad's kicking me out of the house that night so he and Sherry can have a little party. Oh, I don't know. Life really is a circle, isn't it? I'm letting Dad use my place for his friends to get together, and just a few years ago it would have been Dad who'd have to leave his house for my parties. "
"Niles: Yes, if you'd had any parties when we were young that would be filled with irony "
"Daphne: Thank goodness you're here, I've got some rather shocking news. "
"Niles: What is it? "
"Daphne: I found a ring in your father's underwear drawer. "
"Frasier: What on earth would leave a ring around his underwear drawer? "
"Daphne: Not around, in An engagement ring in a jewelry box. "
"Niles: An engagement ring? Dad must be about to ask Sherry to marry him. Do you know what that means? "
"Frasier: Yes, we're going to hear what Mendelssohn's 'Wedding March' sounds like on the banjo "
"Niles: It means she's going to be our mother. What are we going to do? "
"Frasier: Well, there's nothing we can do, Niles. It's what Dad wants. "
"Niles: But... what do we even call her? "
"Frasier: Well, I suppose she'll want us to call her 'mother.' No, that's too formal. 'Mama'... no, 'Ma' "
"Niles: Ooh, better still. 'Don't you look nice, Ma.' 'Yes, I'd love another corn dog, Ma.' 'Off to the roller derby, Ma'?' "
"Daphne: That's typical of you two. Your father is about to get married and all you two can think about is how it will affect you. What about me? "
"Frasier: What about you? "
"Daphne: Sherry's never exactly liked me. You don't think she'll try to make your father get rid of me, do you? "
"Frasier: Oh, Daphne, of course not. He'd be lost without you. "
"Niles: Yes, and even if by some chance that were to happen, Daphne, I could always use you. I, I would know of a position you could take... ...services that you could perform. I would know of an opening... [realizes the path he has taken and takes up the check] This is on me. "
"Sherry: Marty, you need to stir the dip more, it's got whole lumps of soup mix in it. "
"Martin: Sorry. "
"Frasier: My, my, my, quite a little shindig you two are planning for tonight. We have the cheese logs, the erotic fortune cookies. For after dinner, a bloopers "
"tape: 'Too Hot For Hee-Haw.' "
"Niles: I see that Martha Stewart party book I gave you really paid off. "
"Sherry: Oh, this old crowd, they wouldn't go for that fru-fru stuff. Get 'em liquored up, put out some corn nuts and they can go all night. "
"Frasier: When you say all night-? "
"Martin: There you go, smooth as silk. "
"Sherry: Thank you. "
"Niles: Who's going to be attending this soirée? "
"Sherry: Oh, just some old friends I'm dying for Marty to meet. Now, let's see, there's Ray and Lola Sherwood - well, I worked with them in Atlantic City when they had a knife-throwing act. Oh, now, Marty, try not to stare at her eyes, she gets self-conscious. And, let's see. Oh, and Edith's coming with her new fiancé. "
"Martin: Oh, she finally met him, huh? "
"Sherry: Mm, just this week. "
"Niles: They're engaged and they just met this weekend? "
"Sherry: Well, you see, up until now, it's been kind of a pen-pal relationship. He's been... detained the last few years. "
"Frasier: Well, you know, you're going to need some room for those corn nuts, why don't I just get this pesky priceless sculpture out of your way "
"Sherry: Marty, I never heard back from Vic and Linda, did you get a message? "
"Martin: No. "
"Sherry: Oh, gee, maybe they left one on my machine. "
"Martin: So, what are you guys up to tonight? "
"Niles: Em, our wine club is having a vertical tasting at the 'Opus One.' "
"Martin: Oh, well, don't drink too much. "
"Niles: It's not like that, Dad, you don't actually drink the wine. You just swish it around and spit it out. "
"Martin: We all did that at Duke's New Year's Eve party. Of course, it wasn't wine, it was egg salad "
"Sherry: You know, that is so weird. I just got a message from my manager down at McGinty's. Some guy came in asking a lot of questions about me. "
"Martin: What kind of questions? "
"Sherry: Well, like where I used to work, the people I used to date, and the weirdest part is, my neighbor told me somebody came around asking her about me too. "
"Martin: Sounds like somebody's checking up on ya'. "
"Sherry: Like a detective? "
"Martin: Oh no, it's probably a credit card company, something like that, I wouldn't worry about it. "
"Sherry: Well, still, it is a little scary. I wish I knew who it was. "
"Martin: Oh, forget about it, I've been through this before. Private investigators never leave a trail. Really, it could be anyone. "
"Sherry: If you think so. "
"Martin: Which one of you hired him? "
"Frasier: Well, that is just crazy "
"Martin: Oh, come on, who else would have the money to do something like that? "
"Frasier: I have no idea, we have nothing to do with it. Do you really think that we would hire someone to spy on Sherry? My God, I'm insulted "
"Niles: As am I "
"Martin: Well, all right. Maybe I was jumping to the wrong conclusion. "
"Frasier: You most certainly have "
"Martin: I'm sorry, boys. "
"Frasier: It's all right, Dad. "
"Niles: Just forget about it. "
"Frasier: You hired a detective, how could you? "
"Niles: I have never been so insul- "
"Frasier: Niles "
"Niles: Okay, I'm sorry. I was just looking out for Dad here. I mean, what do we really know about this woman? "
"Frasier: She makes Dad happy, that's all we need to know. "
"Niles: Is it? Some people do get married before they know all they should. Remember Cousin Donald? He was married two years before he found out his wife used to be a man. "
"Frasier: Yes, well, Cousin Donald is a very rare case. First, most people don't have a hidden past; and second, most people have a better eye for details than Cousin Donald. For God's sake, the woman could pick up a watermelon with one hand "
"Niles: I was just simply trying to get some background information. "
"Frasier: Well, stop it. Call it off right now, Niles. "
"Niles: Consider it done. "
"Frasier: All right. "
"Niles: We gotta run. "
"Frasier: Yeah. Goodbye. "
"Martin: Bye, boys. "
"Sherry: Have a nice time you two, we'll save you some cake. "
"Frasier: Thank you. You see that, how sweet she is? My God, I can't believe you're actually having that woman investigated. You know, try to have a little trust in people "
"TO: "
"Roz: You see someone following me? "
"Frasier: Yes, you can play along now. "
"Police: Ah, excuse me, ma'am, I saw you cross against the light. I'm going to have to write you a ticket. "
"Roz: Oh, well, I'm really sorry about that. It's just that it's so cold out there and the pollution, I just didn't want to expose my unborn child to the elements any longer than I needed to. "
"Police: You're pregnant? Well, I know a little bit about that myself. "
"Roz: Then you know exactly what I'm talking about. Society doesn't go easy on pregnant ladies, does it? So, when are you due? "
"Police: I'm not pregnant "
"Roz: That's Roz Doyle. "
"Police: Would you step over here? "
"Roz: R-O-Z. "
"Frasier: Hello, Niles. "
"Niles: Oh, hello, Frasier. May I borrow your pen? "
"Frasier: Certainly. How do you do? "
"Niles: I appreciate all your hard work and I am sorry to have to break off the investigation in the middle. "
"Detective: That's all right, people change their minds all the time. "
"Niles: I'm sure they do. There you are. "
"Detective: Thank you. "
"Frasier: There now, don't you feel better? "
"Niles: I suppose so. "
"Frasier: You have to admit, I was right on this one. There was absolutely no justification for giving into your baser instincts of prying in Sherry's past. "
"Detective: I almost forgot. I wrote up a little report on what I found out so far. That's one interesting lady. "
"Niles: Well, I should have just told him to drop that in the trash. After all, we're concerned with Dad's happiness. Sometimes, Frasier, you are like the beacon piercing the fog of my baser instincts. Excuse me, would you just drop that in the... "
"Frasier: I see your point. I hate myself for what I'm doing. "
"Niles: Frasier, we're doing it for Dad's own good. "
"Frasier: Oh, so far, so "
"good: graduated from high school; almost paid off her Subaru; you know she's been married. "
"Niles: Yes, she mentioned that, to Johnny Dempsey. "
"Frasier: There were two others. Ned Foley, Mark Wallace... "
"Niles: That's a bit troubling, three previous marriages. "
"Frasier: ...Vincent Mayhew, Guiltham Mandel, Waltz... "
"Niles: Just give me the total "
"Frasier: Six that we know of. God, you had to go and fire that detective before he finishes reporting "
"Niles: Six? "
"Frasier: Yes, she's obviously incapable of remaining in a relationship. That doesn't bode well for the marriage, does it? "
"Niles: And on the other hand, it does bode well for Dad getting a 'yes' when he proposes. He has a right to know about this. "
"Frasier: But we already told him we weren't involved in the investigation, we can't just tell him now we were lying "
"Niles: Maybe there's some way to impart the information without explaining how we came by it. You know, just sort of drop it casually in the conversation. "
"Frasier: And how would that go? Oh, Dad, you going to the Sherry Ex-Husband Convention this year? Besides that, you know, Dad may know everything already. "
"Niles: I think we need to find that out. How would we feel if we let Dad marry this woman, and in a year's time he's tossed aside like Danny Mitchell. "
"Frasier: Who's that? "
"Niles: Page five, engaged but never married. "
"Martin: Hey, boys. Daph', what do you think about this jacket? I don't know, it just - something doesn't quite feel right. "
"Daphne: I think it's nice. "
"Martin: Really? "
"Daphne: Yes. "
"Frasier: You know, Dad, I was talking with a lady today down at the café and I happened to mention that I'd been married twice before, and a look clouded over her face as if I'd confessed to some unspeakable sin "
"Niles: Makes you wonder what people go through who've been married even more times than that. Quite a taboo they face. "
"Daphne: Oh, I don't know, some... "
"Frasier: You know, Dad, I think it harkens back to the puritanical streak that still runs through this country. What do you think? "
"Martin: There's a yakkety-yak streak that runs through this family. Maybe, it's the shirt, do you like this shirt? "
"Daphne: Yes, it's nice. "
"Frasier: That'd make a good topic to discuss on my show. Niles, you know the hurdles that are faced by people with multiple marriages. "
"Niles: Of course, the hard part would be rounding up enough people who've been married a significant number of times. Do you know anyone? "
"Frasier: No, I don't. "
"Daphne: You know, Mrs. Krabs upstairs- "
"Frasier: How about you, Dad? "
"Martin: Oh, yeah, sure, I know some people. "
"Frasier: Really? You do. "
"Martin: Well, I think. "
"Niles: You think. "
"Martin: Well, maybe I do, maybe I don't, who cares? I hate this shirt, I better go change this shirt "
"Frasier: Well, that was fruitless "
"Daphne: I'll tell you one thing I'm sure of. "
"Frasier: Yes? "
"Daphne: Oh, I'm allowed to talk now, am I? I've never seen your father so nervous. He's meeting Sherry at McGinty's, I bet he's planning to pop the question. "
"Niles: Well, that's it Frasier, we're just going to tell him what we found out. "
"Frasier: Yes, but we still don't know what he knows. "
"Niles: Don't you think if she had told him she had been married six times, then he would remember? "
"Daphne: Who, Sherry? "
"Martin: You know, maybe this shirt isn't so bad. Especially with this new jacket. What do you think of this new jacket? "
"Daphne: I think it's nice. Sherry's been married six times? "
"Martin: Who told you that? "
"Daphne: "
"Martin: What's this all about? "
"Frasier: You know, Dad, I'd love to see that first shirt with the second jacket. "
"Martin: Oh, come on. You got this from the investigator - you did hire him, didn't you? "
"Frasier: All right, I guess there's no use denying it. Yes, yes, we did hire him. Although the word 'we' is not entirely accurate. "
"Niles: Frasier, I am shocked... "
"Frasier: Oh, shut up, Niles Look, Dad, we were just concerned about you. We know about the engagement ring. "
"Martin: My ring? Which one of you went through my drawers? "
"Frasier: Right now, pointing fingers is not going to do us any good. "
"Martin: What the hell is the matter with you two? "
"Frasier: She did it "
"Martin: Well, it's nice to know there isn't a single person in this house I can trust. Sherry told me about her marriages the first week of our dating I didn't tell you because it's none of your damn business, just like it's none of your damn business who I marry or who I don't marry I don't know why I'm even wasting my time talking to you "
"Daphne: Do you see what I get for confiding in you two blabbermouths The next time I find something interesting in your father's underwear drawer, I'm just gonna sit on it "
"Niles: Well, this evening is an entire disaster. I'm already late for dinner with Maris. I just don't know how this could have happened. "
"Frasier: Yes, who'd have guessed that something so innocent as spying on a man's girlfriend and rifling his underwear drawer can turn so ugly "
"Niles: Well, there is one consolation. We told Dad the truth and we were able to bear his anger. That's the nice thing about our relationship, we're all adults. We can talk things through, we're not afraid of confrontation... "
"Frasier: Stop stalling, Niles Dad must be on the elevator by now "
"Daphne: Look what I found in your father's jacket. "
"Frasier: I do not want to know about it. "
"Daphne: He forgot the ring This is going to be embarrassing for him. I suppose I could take it down to him. "
"Frasier: No, no, Daphne. I should do that. It will give me an excellent opportunity to show him just how happy I am that he's marrying Sherry. "
"Daphne: That would be very nice. "
"Frasier: Yes. I just can't figure out why he would propose in a place like McGinty's It seems like such a shabby setting. [looks at ring] Well, I guess he was just trying to match the ring. "
"Sherry: So I told her that you and I would take a trip up there this spring. Well, you like my sister, right? "
"Martin: Yeah, sure. "
"Sherry: Oh, now, come on, Mart'. You can't hold one little embarrassing moment against her. She didn't know you were in there "
"Martin: No, no, I don't. I like your sister. "
"Sherry: Well, then what is wrong with you? You're being so quiet. "
"Martin: I got something on my mind. "
"Sherry: Well, what is it? "
"Martin: I've been thinking a lot about us and... where do you see us going? "
"Sherry: Gee, I don't know. I mean, I'm having fun the way things are. You have your life, I have mine. No pressure. "
"Martin: That's what I thought you'd say. "
"Sherry: There's nothing wrong with us just having fun. "
"Martin: No. It's just that we've been just having fun for a long time now. Let me ask you something, where do you see us in a year? Five years? "
"Sherry: Oh, gee, I don't know, I try not to look too far ahead. "
"Martin: Well, I guess that's the difference between us. Because I can't stop thinking that far ahead. You know, I've come to realize, Sherry, that I want to get married again. And you know it's not anything you're interested in. "
"Sherry: Well, can you blame me? I mean, Marty you know my track record, I've been down that road a lot of times I mean, I've learned the hard way, I'm not looking for forever. "
"Martin: I am. "
"Sherry: So... so you're breaking up with me? "
"Martin: We're just looking for different things, Sherry. I'm sorry. "
"Martin: It's hot in here. "
"Sherry: Yeah. "
"Frasier: Dad, Dad "
"Martin: What? "
"Frasier: I'm glad I've seen you. "
"Martin: Get out of here. "
"Frasier: Dad, Dad, I've got something that I think you might like to have before you tell Sherry whatever it is you want to tell her. "
"Sherry: Oh, he's already told me. "
"Frasier: He has? Well, that is just wonderful and may I say, it's about time I couldn't be happier for you. "
"Sherry: That's nice to know. "
"Martin: Frasier "
"Frasier: I'd like you to know that everybody is one hundred percent behind this decision - my God, we're all so excited. "
"Martin: FRASIER "
"Sherry: Well, I'm so glad that you're so happy your father's breaking up with me. "
"Frasier: I had no idea. "
"Sherry: And you get paid to help people through their difficult moments? "
"TO: "
"Martin: It isn't easy to say goodbye, is it? "
"Sherry: No. It doesn't get any easier either, I should know. Listen, Marty, this is usually the time people say, 'Well, let's be friends' and then, oh, there's a phone call or two but they never see each other again and, well, I just want you to know I am around for you if you ever get lonely or you just need to talk. "
"Martin: Thanks. "
"Sherry: Oh, and when you call, if a man answers - hang up. "
"Frasier: Hi, Dad. The only reason I came down here was to bring you this. Obviously I made another colossal blunder in a week full of them. I'm really sorry, Dad. I guess you don't really feel like talking. "
"Martin: You know, Frasier, sometimes I just feel like sitting here and watching the game, all right? "
"Frasier: Fine, I can do that. "
"Martin: Yeah. "
"Frasier: Sure. So the, er, Sonics and the, er, Bulls. That Jordan, he's really something, huh? Yeah. The way he scores those points and gets the ball back when the other team misses... Wow That's incredible. He made the same impossible shot twice in a row "
"Martin: It's the instant replay. You know, I was carrying this thing around for a month. "
"Frasier: Really? "
"Martin: Yeah, but at the end of every night I just couldn't pop the question, and then I realized I knew what the answer would be. She didn't want to get married again. "
"Frasier: I'm sorry, Dad. "
"Martin: Oh, it's all right. Maybe it wouldn't have worked out between us anyway. Your mom's a hard act to follow I never went through anything like this with her. We knew we were meant to be together and that was that. "
"Frasier: It's hard to find that out, Dad. I've been trying for a while. "
"Martin: You'll get there. I hope we both do. "
"Frasier: Well, Dad, in time. "
"Frasier: Well, that was quite a shot "
"Martin: Patton's been pretty hot lately. "
"Frasier: What's the score here, anyway? "
"Martin: Sonics are only down by five, they've still got a chance if they can hold Jordan. "
"Frasier: Can I have a beer here, please? "
"Martin: Yeah, make that two. "

"Bebe: Well, well, well, look who's here. It's KACL's Frasier Crane. "
"Frasier: And Rosemary's Bebe. "
"Bebe: So, quite a little shake-up going on down at the station. I hear the new owner wants to renegotiate everyone's contract. "
"Frasier: Mmm-hmm. And before you drop another gossamer hint, let me tell you that my feelings about you haven't changed. "
"Bebe: Fine Actually, I'm here to meet one of my newer clients, a rising star of the Seattle airwaves. "
"Frasier: Oh, really, and what pathetic do-gooder have you lured into your web now? "
"Bebe: Roz "
"Frasier: Oh, dear God. "
"Bebe: You just get off your feet, little mother. I'll fetch you a nice, nourishing muffin. "
"Frasier: You signed with Bebe? "
"Roz: Okay, I know, I should've told you, I just wasn't in the mood for one of your lectures. "
"Frasier: I'm not going to give you a lecture. You're entitled to choose whoever you wish to represent you. Someone who's honest, or a woman whose ethics would've raised eyebrows in the court of Caligula "
"Roz: Look, she's gotten me three voice-over jobs. She may be a little shifty, but she helps me put food on the table. "
"Bebe: One muffin. "
"Roz: See? "
"Bebe: So, Roz, I had a brainstorm last night about how to turn this little bundle of joy into a big bundle of cash "
"Roz: I'm going to use my baby to make money? "
"Frasier: Yes, it's high time the little slacker started pulling his weight "
"Bebe: You know Doctor Clint Weber's medical show? Well, I see a daily segment called, 'A Pregnant "
"Pause: Roz Doyle's Term of Endearment.' All of Seattle will share in the miracle happening inside you - your joys, hopes, morning sickness, sonograms, even the birth "
"Roz: I'll give birth on the air? "
"Bebe: It's radio. Just make the noises. Hell, I'll make them myself "
"Waitress: Need anything else here? "
"Frasier: Just a shower, thank you. "
"Bebe: You know, Mr. Integrity, word on the street is you still haven't hired anyone to negotiate this big deal for you. Could it be because in your heart you know you want to come back to me? "
"Frasier: Yes, well if I'm taking my time it's because I'm determined to make the right choice. "
"Roz: Well, you're gonna need somebody good "
"Frasier: That's exactly what I intend to find, someone good I'm going to prove to both of you it's possible to find an agent who can drive a hard bargain and yet maintain the highest ethical standards "
"Bebe: Happy hunting. If things don't work out, you know my number. "
"Frasier: Still 666, is it? "
"Niles: Hello, Dad. I believe we switched videotapes on accident. "
"Martin: Believe me, I noticed. "
"Niles: Yes, there you go. At first I was dismayed. I popped in the tape, and there was Charles Bronson blowing away street trash, but I actually got into it. It was quite suspenseful. "
"Martin: Yeah, well, that's the way Duke and I felt about 'My Dinner With Andre.' Talk about suspense [fake, dramatic anticipation] Will they order dessert? Will they leave a good tip? "
"Frasier: Oh, hello, Niles. "
"Niles: Frasier, I'm sorry to trouble you about this, but could you recommend another couples' therapist? "
"Frasier: Good Lord, not again. What happened to Dr. Prescott? "
"Niles: Oh, please, Maris had me can Dr. Prescott weeks ago. Now she wants me to fire Dr. Wilphaum. "
"Frasier: What's her problem with him? "
"Niles: She says his criticism of her is too harsh. "
"Frasier: Well, some therapists can be rather blunt and hard-hitting. What did he say? "
"Niles: He asked her to refrain from catalogue shopping during our sessions. "
"Frasier: You know Niles, if you fire every therapist who finds fault with her, you're never going to make any progress. "
"Niles: You're right, of course. I'll just tell her, 'We're not going to change therapists, that's that.' "
"Frasier: Good You know, sometimes there's nothing more rewarding than sticking to a principle. Case in point, you know, my contract's coming up, and, uh, well, Bebe Glazer's been angling to negotiate my new one. Anyway, I could've done the easy thing, said yes, taken the money and run, but instead, I said no, and I found myself a new agent, one who's every bit as smart and also ethical. "
"Niles: Hmmm. "
"Frasier: That's him now. "
"Martin: Well, I don't know what kinda bull that guy sold you, but there's no such thing as an ethical agent. One's just as slimy as the other. "
"Frasier: Hello, Ben. "
"Ben: Hi. Sorry I'm late. I was making my last Meals on Wheels delivery and I swerved to avoid a pigeon. You know, splat went the food all over the stuffed bears for the toy drive. I had to run home, throw the bears in the wash, and cook some more borsht for Mrs. Pavlov. "
"Frasier: I'm glad you made it. Anyway, this is my brother, Doctor Niles Crane. "
"Ben: Hi, it's a pleasure to meet you. "
"Niles: Hi. Sorry, I'm running out. You're certainly a refreshing change from Frasier's last agent. I think she would have swerved to hit the pigeon. "
"Frasier: Well, she would have swerved to hit Mrs. Pavlov Ben, I'd like you to meet my dad, Martin. "
"Frasier: Oh, and this is his home health care worker, Daphne. Daphne, this is Ben, my new agent. "
"Daphne: Oh, very nice to meet you. "
"Martin: Well, Ben, it sounds like you're a pretty busy volunteer. "
"Frasier: Yes, indeed, you know, Ben just won this year's Seattle Samaritan Award. "
"Ben: Well, enough about me. Let's talk about you. May I? "
"Frasier: Oh, please. "
"Ben: I was thinking that before we start this negotiation it wouldn't hurt to raise your public profile. "
"Frasier: I like the sound of that. "
"Ben: Okay, here's my plan. For a year now, I've done pro bono work for the Mercer Island Zoo - you know, getting the word out, creating awareness -- "
"Daphne: There's a zoo on Mercer Island? "
"Ben: You betcha. This'll be great PR for both of you. They just bought a rare crane. I convinced them to name it after you - you know, Frasier 'Crane.' So, there'll be a ceremony with full newspaper and TV coverage. "
"Frasier: I think it's brilliant I'm bolstering my bargaining position and also helping out a plucky little zoo I love this man "
"Daphne: I think it would be fun to have a crane named after me. I just love those big pouchy mouths they scoop up the fish in. "
"Ben: I think those are pelicans. "
"Daphne: Oh, right. Cranes are the ones who always sound like they're laughing. No, wait, I'm thinking of loons. "
"Martin: That's a coincidence. "
"Ben: Oh, shoot, I've got borsht on my sleeve. Do you have any club soda? "
"Daphne: Oh, yes, right through here. [walking toward kitchen, Ben follows] "
"Frasier: Help yourself. "
"Ben: Thank you. "
"Martin: Frasier, you told me this was a pretty big deal. Are you sure you want to send in that Mouseketeer? "
"Frasier: Oh, why does everybody assume that in order to be an agent you have to be some unscrupulous huckster? It is possible for a good and decent man to be every bit as intimidating as the toughest shark out there. "
"Ben: Well, time to skedaddle. I have to pick up a friend. The poor guy just went bankrupt, so I'm letting him bunk in my ruckus room for a while. "
"Frasier: Well, that's awfully generous of you. "
"Ben: Well, he's not just a friend, he's a client. "
"TO: "
"Director: Um, and then the press and the board members will join us in here for a buffet. "
"Frasier: So I finish my speech, and then I give Mr. Twembly here the cue and he brings out this marvelous creature. "
"Twembly: Just give me the signal. "
"Martin: Aw, this is great Look at this Turkey, chicken wings Hey Gotta make you a little nervous, huh? "
"Daphne: Look It's Toffee Macintosh, from the news I just love her "
"Frasier: Oh, yes, really? "
"Toffee: Frasier. "
"Frasier: Toffee. Thank you for covering us. "
"Toffee: Aw, you know my motto, 'If it happens in Seattle, it's news to me.' "
"Frasier: Listen, I'd like you to meet one of your biggest fans, Daphne Moon. "
"Daphne: Hello. I just love the way you get all somber when you describe a flood or a murder, then you cheer right up the minute you're done Makes me think, well, if she can get over it, so can I. "
"Toffee: That's what I'm here for. "
"Ben: Ready to greet your public? "
"Frasier: Well, uh, yes Come on, Dad "
"Martin: All right, I'll be there in a sec. "
"Bebe: Why, you see what maternal instincts this woman has? Even little Bobo here can sense it. "
"Frasier: Well, I can see I'm not the only one getting some publicity today. "
"Ben: Frasier, they want to start pretty soon. "
"Frasier: Oh, Ben, Ben, just a moment, I'd like you to meet some people. This is Bebe and Roz. This is Ben, my new agent. "
"Ben: Hey, talk about your small worlds. Turns out Mr. Twembly and I both sang tenor for the same choir back home in Salt Lake City. Nice meeting you ladies. "
"Bebe: Well, when there's a dirty job to be done, you can't go wrong with a Mormon. "
"Frasier: Scoff all you like, the man is a genius at PR. "
"is: Bebe, Roz, Daphne, and a few places over from them, Ben. "
"Twembly: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. On behalf of the Mercer Island Zoo, I'd like to welcome our very special guest, Doctor Frasier Crane. "
"Frasier: Thank you, Mr. Twembly. I suppose it's only appropriate that the zoo has called upon me to introduce you all to its newest resident. You see, he happens to be a relative of mine. "
"TO: "
"Martin: Hey, what're you lookin' at? This is human food. You don't see me lookin' at your bird food, do you? [turns away from bird and toward the buffet; bird bites the seat of Martin's pants; turns back around] What do you think you're doing, huh? That's not very nice [shakes his cane at the bird; cane catches on cage, opening gate; bird jumps out]. Oh, wait, wait, no, no, no, wait, where you goin'? "
"TO: "
"Frasier: ...We're both tall and have distinctive profiles, we've both been known to winter in Mexico, and let's not forget our voices. Is there anything as stirring as the crane's majestic cry? "
"Martin: Yeyaaaaaaaa Get this thing off me [hobbles in, holding ear] "
"Frasier: Dad, are you all right? What's happening? [uproar; bird runs behind him, chased by several men] My goodness What is going on Oh, I'm sorry Nothing to be alarmed about Just a little family squabble "
"Toffee: In a gruesome incident this afternoon, the Mercer Island Zoo seemed more like the Island of Doctor Moreau.... "
"to: Living room. Martin is sitting in chair with Frasier to "
"Toffee: ...as a distinguished senior citizen was savagely attacked by Frasier Crane, Bird of Prey. "
"Frasier: I can't watch any more of this. "
"Martin: Well, that makes us even. I can't hear any of it. "
"Frasier: Oh, you weren't hurt that badly Of course, you wouldn't know that to listen to Toffee. She makes the whole thing sound like a disaster "
"Daphne: I know. But did you see the way she could smile right after? "
"Frasier: Lord, this entire affair's turned into a PR nightmare "
"Martin: Well, it's your own fault for hiring Howdy Doody as your agent "
"Frasier: Dad, I'm sorry. Ben had no idea that bird was going to attack you. Besides, there is a school of thought that says there's no such thing as bad publicity. "
"Niles: Frasier, I was just hearing about you on the car radio. The deejay was offering a cash prize for the best Frasier Crane joke. Wait, what was the front-runner? Oh, yes, how can you tell Frasier the Crane's a psychiatrist? "
"Frasier: I can't wait to hear. "
"Niles: He ignores what you say then sticks you with a large bill. "
"Niles: [walking toward Martin's chair as Frasier goes to his bookshelves] You must excuse my jolly mood, but Maris was over tonight for our weekly conjugal visit. "
"Martin: Eeww, Jeez. "
"Niles: I've never seen her look so seductive. She wore a clingy gown, crimson lipstick, even earrings, which she tends to avoid as they make her head droop. She pulled me down upon the bed and began playing my spine like a zither. And then, just as things were heating up, she renewed her request that I dismiss Doctor Wilphaum. So tremulous with desire was I that I almost relented, but then I remembered your advice, Frasier, and I said I wouldn't fire the good doctor - at which point Maris told me I wouldn't be firing anything else in the foreseeable future And she left "
"Frasier: Now, now, now, Niles, withholding sex may be just as difficult on Maris She may crumble first "
"Niles: Are you serious? One hour of passion can sustain her for months. She stores it up like some sexual camel. "
"Frasier: All right, Niles. You know that my advice was solid. "
"Niles: I hope you're right. I'll get it. Hello? Oh, hello Roz. It's Roz. "
"Frasier: Thank you. Roz, hello. Yes, what is it? "
"Niles: That's a striking arrangement. "
"Martin: It's from Bebe. After what happened today, she's trying to woo him back. "
"Niles: Birds of Paradise, I suppose that's her idea of floral irony. "
"Frasier: Yes, well, ah, thanks for the warning, Roz. "
"Martin: What's that about? "
"Frasier: Oh, well, it turns out the station manager won't be renegotiating the contracts himself. Apparently he's brought in one of these hired guns stations use to reduce costs. Some fellow nicknamed 'The Hammer.' "
"Niles: I'm assuming they call him 'The Hammer' because he's tough. "
"Frasier: No, Niles, because he loves the lyrics of Oscar Hammerstein "
"Martin: You know, Frasier, if I were you, I'd give Bebe a call. Now, I'm no fan of hers, either, but this is a pretty big negotiation. "
"Frasier: No, Dad, I am sticking with Ben. Oh, sure, maybe Bebe could use her dark arts to get me a dollar or two more, but, you know, my integrity is worth more than that. Hello, Ben. "
"Ben: Hey, big guy. How ya doing? "
"Frasier: Well, uh, fine. "
"Ben: Good. Boy, people sure are being mean about this I was just listening to the radio on the way over. Ouch. But I always say, if life hands you a lemon, make lemonade. "
"Frasier: That's the spirit. So you've got some sort of damage-control plan? "
"Ben: You betcha. I got a way to turn this whole mess around and show that station manager just what you're made of. "
"Frasier: Excellent But you won't be dealing with him. You'll be dealing with this free-lancer they call 'The Hammer.' "
"Ben: Hoo-boy. "
"Martin: You've gone up against him? "
"Ben: Oh yes, and I had to take a pretty firm line with him. "
"Frasier: Well, I'm glad to hear that. "
"Ben: Yeah, I finally said, 'You better just clean up your language, Pal. I walked out on that Mamet play, I can walk out on you.' "
"Frasier: So, uh, about your plan. "
"Ben: Yeah, right Um, I think there's a way to show people you're laughing right along with them. You do a photo op where you, Seattle's best-loved psychiatrist, give the crane therapy. You know, you sit in a chair with a pad on your lap, and the crane - properly sedated, of course - sits on... [pulls out a miniature psychiatrist's couch] THIS. "
"Niles: Where on earth did you find a couch that size? "
"Ben: Oh, I built it myself. I have a little workshop in my attic where I make toys for the neighborhood kids. "
"Martin: Look at you Agent, samaritan... elf. "
"Frasier: Dad, I like this idea It's droll... and self-mocking. It's the perfect way to turn a PR embarrassment into a triumph "
"Ben: Great. I'll set up the photo op. And don't you be nervous about The Hammer, all right? Because I can be a pretty tough customer myself "
"Frasier: I'm sure you can I know you're gonna go in there and you're gonna give him hell "
"Ben: Boy, I love show business, but I'll never get used to the cursing "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Latte, please. "
"Waitress: Hey, didn't I see your picture in the paper today? There was a big bird chasing you around a little couch "
"Frasier: Latte, please. "
"Niles: Well, I think you have a real case against the maker of those crane sedatives. "
"Frasier: Thank you for the sympathy "
"Niles: You're not the only one going through a rough patch. Maris has strained my libido to the breaking point "
"Frasier: Niles, you can't give in "
"Niles: I'm getting desperate This morning, I found myself flirting with my manicurist "
"Frasier: The one with the thing on her face? "
"Niles: I told you, I'm desperate "
"Frasier: What can be keeping Ben? "
"Niles: After all this, you're still using Ben? Shouldn't you just go back to Bebe? "
"Frasier: I see what you're doing. You think if I bail out on my principles it gives you an excuse to go crawling back to Maris. Well, I'm not going to do it. Ben may have made some mistakes, but he is a good man, and he's going to make me a good deal "
"Frasier: Oh, Gil How'd it go with the Hammer? "
"Gil: You've never seen such cold, dead eyes It was like bargaining with Nosferatu. My salary's been slashed "
"Frasier: Oh, I'm sorry. "
"Waitress: Can I do anything else for you? "
"Niles: Yes, would you mind nibbling on this provocatively? "
"Frasier: Niles "
"Gil: I wish you good luck, Frasier. I don't see anybody squeezing blood from that stone. "
"Bebe: Lattes for everyone "
"Gil: Dear God, don't tell me you did well "
"Roz: I got a weekly spot on Clint Weber's show and a thirty percent raise "
"Gil: How on earth did you get all that? "
"Bebe: Oh, we go way back, the Hammer and I. I know where the bodies are buried. Usually, that's just a metaphor. "
"Roz: So, Gil, what'll you have? My treat? "
"Gil: I think I'll be happier at the losers' table with Aunt Penny, the story lady. Penny Don't put that flask away "
"Frasier: Well, congratulations, Roz. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm waiting for Ben. We have to discuss our bargaining position. "
"Bebe: Oh, there're so many to choose from. Kneeling, crawling, groveling. I'm sure he'll pick the right one. "
"Frasier: God, she is obnoxious "
"Niles: Mmmm. Though alluring, in a buxom, bad-girl kind of way. "
"Frasier: Oh, shut up, you horny idiot My bandage seems a little loose. If Ben gets here, just tell him I went in to fix it. "
"TO: "
"Bebe: Frasier, we have to talk. "
"Frasier: Are you aware that you are in the men's room? "
"Bebe: Oh, please, if I paid attention to signs with little pictures on them... I'd never get a parking space. Now, it's time we both dropped the masks. You need me, and I want you back. Just sign this contract. I'll cut you a deal that'll make Roz's look like lunch money. "
"Frasier: Isn't there a zebra carcass somewhere you should be hovering over? "
"Bebe: You wanna see a carcass, chum? [grabs Frasier and faces him toward mirror] Look in the mirror. Look what you've let that man do to you. Your face is riddled with bird bites, your name's a punchline, and your career is five minutes from over, and he's only been your agent for three days "
"Bebe: Send him in against the Hammer and you'll be doing fog reports from a lighthouse in Puget Sound [turns him around toward her almost violently] Admit it You're scared "
"Frasier: All right, maybe I am scared But... there is one thing that is stronger than fear Faith Faith that a good man with a good heart can make a good deal [pushes her back] Now get out of my way "
"Bebe: No, I won't let you D'you know what I've been through building your career? I have been to hell and back so often I have frequent flier miles [runs to him, grabs the lapels of his coat and pulls him toward her] You owe me a second chance "
"Frasier: Take your tentacles off of me "
"Bebe: Please I won't be the same Bebe you knew I'll change I'll be like Ben Only competent "
"Bebe: Darling, you forgot to sign "
"Niles: Oh, you reconciled. Congratulations, I'll just be off to Maris's. "
"Frasier: Sit down, Niles I'm still with Ben. "
"Frasier: Ben "
"Ben: Sorry I'm late. I took my son's troop on a nature hike and little Noah got a bee sting, so I rushed him to the emergency room, then I came straight here. "
"Frasier: It's all right, we've got five minutes. "
"Ben: Excuse me. "
"Roz: Now, Frasier, you know Bebe can make you a better deal. "
"Niles: Listen to Roz. "
"Bebe: Listen to Niles. "
"Frasier: I'm not listening to any of you My God, am I the last man on God's green earth that's still willing to stand up for a principle? "
"Ben: Should we go over those demands for ol' Mr. Hammer? "
"Frasier: Ben, could we have a word? "
"Niles: Hello, Maris "
"Frasier: Uh, listen, I don't think it's news to you that things haven't been going so smoothly with us, and I think I'd feel more comfortable with Bebe. I know this must seem a bit of a shock to you, but, ah- "
"Ben: No, I saw this coming. Yesterday, when you threw that little couch at me, I thought to myself, 'This is not a happy client.' "
"Frasier: Thanks for understanding. "
"Niles: Taxi "
"Bebe: Sign right here, darling. "
"Frasier: You know, I'm holding you to that promise about changing. I won't stand for any more shady doings. "
"Bebe: Those days are all behind me. "
"Frasier: Once you've worked out this thing with the Hammer, maybe you can see what you can do about defusing this bird situation. "
"Ben: Oh, you don't have to worry about the crane anymore. The poor thing choked to death this morning. They have no idea who would feed a bird a jawbreaker. Bye, now. "
"Frasier: Is there any chance it wasn't you? "
"Bebe: Oh, darling... [looks around, trying to come up with an answer he'll be satisfied with] There's always a chance. "
"Frasier: "

"Frasier: Morning, Roz. "
"Roz: Hey Frasier, your brother called. He said he'll be over at about seven o' clock tonight. "
"Frasier: Oh, thanks. So, you seem awfully calm today. "
"Roz: Well, why shouldn't I be? "
"Frasier: Well, during ratings week you're usually rather anxious. "
"Roz: Oh my God That starts today? "
"Frasier: Oh, I never should have mentioned it. "
"Roz: Ten seconds. "
"Frasier: Oh Roz, you do this every year, you convince yourself we'll have a disastrous week with no good callers, but our listeners always come through in the end, don't they? "
"Roz: You're on "
"Frasier: All right. Hello Seattle, this is Dr. Frasier Crane. You know, I was reminded this morning of a jaunty aphorism which is credited to the great thinker Spinoza... Meanwhile, in Roz's booth, she is up to her elbows in madness. "
"Roz: Oh God Frasier Crane Show, what's your problem? "
"Mary: Hi, I'm kind of... indecisive. "
"Roz: Well, I'm not Frasier Crane Show, what's your problem? "
"Roger: I'm thinking of changing careers, I feel kinda trapped. "
"Roz: Well, it's not a very exciting problem, but I'll see if I can get you on. Hold, please. Frasier Crane Show, what's your problem? "
"Bill: It's sort of embarrassing. "
"Roz: Amen "
"Bill: I was a bed-wetter as a child and I think the problem's coming back. "
"Roz: Great. Hold, please. Hey, Career Change, I've got a bed-wetter holding. When you say 'trapped,' is it possible you feel you are a woman trapped inside a man's body? "
"Roger: I don't think so. "
"Roz: I don't think I can get you on today, then. "
"Roger: Gee, I really wanted to talk to him... I guess that could be part of it. "
"Roz: Good answer. Hold, please. Hey Bed-Wetter, I've got a transsexual in crisis, you gotta beat that. Have you ever wet a bed with anyone else in it? A hooker, a stripper, or maybe your best friend's wife? "
"Bill: No. "
"Roz: Do you want to talk to the doc or not? "
"Bill: OK. Er, I guess the third one. "
"Roz: Hold, please. Hey Transsexual. "
"Roger: Is that me? "
"Roz: Yeah. Have you ever run for political office, or considered running for political office? "
"Roger: What, you mean like congressman or something? "
"Roz: Perfect "
"Frasier: ...don't get me started on rationalistic pantheism or I'll go the whole three hours Well, I think it's time we went to the phones. Roz, whom do we have? "
"Roz: On line one we have a bed-wetting adulterer, unless you'd rather speak to Roger on line two, who's a transsexual running for Congress. "
"Frasier: Go on then Roger, I'm listening. "
"Daphne: Would you just explain to me why you chickened out like that? "
"Martin: Well, she's younger than I am She probably dates doctors and lawyers, she wouldn't be interested in me. "
"Frasier: Who wouldn't be interested? "
"Martin: Oh, geez. "
"Daphne: A certain someone had the chance to ask a certain someone else from the building on a date. "
"Frasier: Ah, that would be Mrs. Crowley. "
"Martin: Oh, geez "
"Daphne: And bailed out again "
"Frasier: Yes well, Daphne, don't be too hard on him. The Crane men haven't had a great deal of success in the romance department lately. We're all a bit gun-shy. "
"Daphne: Ah yes, gun-shy, sensitive, picky; you're all full of excuses. You know, sometimes I wonder if I'll ever get any of you married off and out of this house. "
"Daphne: Hello? Why, Mrs. Crowley, we were just talking about you Yes he's here, hold on. "
"Martin: Hi. Really? No, I'm not busy, dinner sounds like fun. "
"Daphne: A certain someone is inviting a certain someone else to dinner. "
"Frasier: Yes, where would the world be without you Brits and your knack for code-cracking? "
"Martin: Oh yeah, yeah, sure I'd love to. Thanks. And thanks for asking me. Bye. She's invited me to her place tomorrow night. I guess my little hard-to-get plan really paid off. "
"Daphne: Yes, you should really write a book; 'How To Get A Date In Two Easy Years.' "
"Frasier: Oh, hello Niles. "
"Niles: Frasier. Hey Dad, hey Daphne. "
"Martin: What you got there? "
"Niles: Oh, just some patient files. Frasier's helping me with my couples' group tomorrow night. "
"Daphne: You'r father's starting his own couples' group tomorrow night. "
"Niles: Ha Oh, Mrs. Crowley? "
"Martin: Oh, geez "
"Frasier: It's ironic, isn't it? Dad's doing better in that department than either of us. "
"Niles: Not true, not true, that's really what I wanted to tell you. Maris and I are back on the expressway to love Well, if not the expressway, then at least the on-ramp. And I owe it all to the best psychiatrist I have ever known... "
"Frasier: Oh that's very flattering, Niles... "
"Niles: Dr. Bernard Schenkman, our new marriage counselor. And he is nothing short of a wizard. And Maris is as thrilled with him as I am. It's as if he's discovered the magic elixir to repair the shattered fragments of her psyche. I-I don't know exactly what to call it. "
"Frasier: The words 'Krazy Glue' leap to mind. "
"Niles: Dr. Schenkman's helped me enormously too. He immediately pinpointed my primary failing. "
"Frasier: Which is? "
"Niles: Well... I'm too predictable. "
"Frasier: I don't know whether I'd count that as a failing, exactly. "
"Niles: Well, I do, and more importantly, so does Maris. But I'm going to do something about it. In half an hour I'm going to show Maris spontaneity beyond her wildest dreams. "
"Frasier: In half an hour? I thought we were going to prepare for your workshop "
"Niles: I'm sorry, you'll have to look over the files yourself. You see, every Friday evening Maris spends an hour meditating in her spirituality gardens. Invariably she comes inside randy as a stoat. Well tonight, she's going to find me, waiting in her bed, as randy as a...nother stoat. "
"Frasier: Gee Niles, I wonder if that's a good idea... "
"Niles: Frasier, I know you mean well, and I love you and respect you, so please don't take offense when I point out that, with your track record in relationships, you're about the last person who should be giving advice. "
"Frasier: Fair enough "
"Niles: Oh and do look over the files Those couples really need our help. "
"TO: "
"Niles: Hello, Maris "
"Both: Maris? AHHH "
"Time: 8"
":17) "
"Niles: Dr. Schenkman "
"Schenkman: Niles "
"Niles: Dr. Schenkman, what the hell's going on? "
"Schenkman: Well, it's not what it looks like... what am I saying? "
"Niles: For God’s sake "
"Schenkman: Bear with me, I'm sorry. I’m, I'm feeling a little stressed. "
"Niles: You're feeling stressed? "
"Schenkman: Put yourself in my place. "
"Niles: I very nearly did I'm stunned How... how long has this been going on? "
"Schenkman: Two weeks. Maris and I were waiting to tell you when I felt that you were ready. "
"Niles: That's despicable It's unethical, it's... [notices his clothes] are those my pajamas? "
"Schenkman: Could be. They bind a little in the crotch. Listen, whatever anger you're feeling can't begin to approach my guilt. "
"Niles: Don't bet on it "
"Schenkman: Ah good, that's good, vent that rage. You have every right to. "
"Niles: You're sleeping with my wife and you're giving me permission to be angry? "
"Schenkman: Furious. "
"Niles: Ah-ah. "
"Schenkman: Livid. "
"Niles: Ah "
"Schenkman: Yes, you're dealing with it very well, by the way. "
"Niles: Oh "
"Schenkman: I don't suppose you'd care- "
"Niles: No Do you realize you could lose your license for having an affair with a patient? "
"Schenkman: Yes, and I deserve to. But it was a risk worth taking, because of love. [lies on the couch, while Niles buries his face in his hand] Ah... oh I love her, Niles. I've never known a woman so warm... so nurturing... so unselfish... Niles looks confused at this description. "
"Niles: Is it possible this is all a case of mistaken identity? "
"Schenkman: Thanks to our sessions, Maris has been unafraid to show me the real woman inside. "
"Niles: Damn you, I trusted you Because you were supposed to be helping us And I liked you too, you bastard You betrayed my confidence and my friendship, and you seduced my wife "
"Schenkman: Wow, there's a lot of new issues here, aren't there? Think maybe we should kick it up to three sessions a week? "
"Frasier: You are twenty minutes late. "
"Niles: Sorry. "
"Frasier: 'Sorry?' This is your group, I've been making small talk with these people for the last twenty minutes. Do you know what small talk is like with people who have a problem communicating? It's tiny talk "
"Niles: Frasier, I just have a lot on my mind right now which I don't care to discuss, so let's just begin and you know what, maybe you should take the lead, OK? "
"Frasier: Very well. "
"Niles: Evening, all. Sorry I'm late, my fault. "
"Frasier: If I know these people, they won't hold a grudge. I feel that I do know a great deal about this group. I've spent a good deal of time poring over your case histories. So, let's begin. Mrs. Budinger, I see that you're here alone. "
"Janice: Yes. "
"Frasier: Is there some reason why Dan couldn't join you? "
"Janice: No, he's just stubborn sometimes. He says he doesn't trust psychiatrists. "
"Niles: Yeah, well... maybe he's got good reason not to "
"Frasier: Excuse me? "
"Janice: Oh, I think I see what your brother's doing here. Sometimes we role-play, and I think he's just saying what my husband might say. "
"Frasier: Sounds promising, why don't we proceed, Janice? How would you respond to what your husband has just said? "
"Janice: Well, OK... you know, Dan, I don't think it's psychiatrists that you mistrust, I think that it's me. Why are you so suspicious lately? "
"Niles: Oh, I think you know very well. "
"Janice: What, a couple of harmless flirtations at parties? Everyone does that. "
"Niles: Did you ever stop to consider how those flirtations might make me feel? "
"Frasier: He's empathizing with the husband, we call this 'empathizing.' "
"Janice: Well, what about you? Are you going to tell me you've never even looked at anyone else? "
"Niles: Don't you dare bring her into this She is clean and pure and decent "
"Frasier: Sometimes empathizing involves a bit of dramatic license. "
"Niles: At least I've always been faithful to you "
"Janice: I've always been faithful to you "
"Niles: I wanted to believe that more than anything in the world, but now, now... I don't see how I possibly can "
"Frasier: Did I mention that my brother's one of the greatest empathizers in the business? "
"Niles: Now I just want to DIE "
"Frasier: You know, perhaps now would be a good time to take our fifteen minute break, why don't we? [the patients start to leave the room] We've had quite a catharsis here - now traditionally it is the patients that make the breakthroughs, but we mustn't be sticklers. He ushers them out, but Janice hangs back. "
"Janice: Dan and I have never cheated on another You've got to believe me "
"Frasier: Well, I do, I do, Janice, and please remember, no-one is here to judge anyone else's behavior. [closes door and shouts at Niles] What the hell are you doing, you lunatic? "
"Niles: Maris is having an affair with Schenkman "
"Frasier: Schenkman Why, that contemptible bastard. "
"Niles: He was waiting at the house for her when I got there. "
"Frasier: I'm so sorry, Niles. Is there anything I can do? "
"Niles: I don't see how. They're in love, they plan to get married "
"Frasier: He told you that? "
"Niles: Mmm-hmm. And she confirmed it when she walked in - once she'd stopped shrieking and we'd coaxed her down off the canopy. "
"Frasier: I'm just shocked. Things seemed to be going so well with the two of you. "
"Niles: That's what I thought. You know, maybe Maris's feelings for Dr. Schenkman aren't real Maybe this is simply a case of transference. "
"Frasier: Well, patients often do believe they've fallen in love with their analysts, it's very common, it's happened to everyone. "
"Niles: I know, it's happened to me "
"Frasier: Oh, get out of town "
"Niles: Several times. Well, I bet that's exactly what's going on here "
"Frasier: I've never had a patient fall in love with me. "
"Niles: Schenkman's an authority figure, Maris is easily influenced... "
"Frasier: Not even that fat lady who brought me fudge. "
"Niles: I'd be a fool to let her go if it's as simple as that "
"Frasier: Now, Niles, you're not thinking clearly. You're just grasping at straws. "
"Niles: No, no, you're wrong. I owe it to my marriage to give this just one more shot. "
"Frasier: How? What more could you possibly do? "
"Niles: I just need to talk to her alone. Try to make her realize what a mistake she's making. "
"Frasier: Niles, just bear one thing in mind... "
"Frasier: Sometimes a marriage is just bad, doomed, and no amount of discussion will save it "
"Frasier: Well, then... shall we resume? "
"TO: "
"Frasier: No, don't worry, Daphne, that's all right, you have fun. I'll be fine. See you tomorrow, everything will be fine, OK. Oh, Dad? No, he's not even back from his big date yet Maybe I'll see him in the morning too. Alright... yes, it is a very romantic story. OK, Daphne... Yes, yes, they do make a very cute couple. Anyway... Right, right, Daphne, yes I suppose they do owe it all to you, don't they? "
"Frasier: Oh well, there's the door. OK. "
"Frasier: Niles? I thought you were talking with Maris. "
"Niles: It's over. Let her marry Schenkman, they deserve each other. "
"Frasier: Oh, I'm sorry, Niles. What happened? "
"Niles: Well, I reached the front gate and I was just about to ring the doorbell to ask her to let me in, when it suddenly dawned on me how many hours I have spent pleading with that woman through gates, through windows, through key holes, and through transoms and... in one disastrous instance, through the pet door. "
"Frasier: Yes, I remember dabbing Bactine on those Chihuahua bites. "
"Niles: Well, I decided no more. I actually looked up at the house and said, 'Goodbye, Maris. I hope you have a happy life but I don't have to take anymore of your crap ever again' And I turned on my heel and walked away. "
"Frasier: That's a courageous decision. How do you feel? "
"Niles: Not bad, surprisingly. I'm glad I went over, I needed the closure. Now that it's over I feel a little sad of course, but also strangely liberated. "
"Frasier: I'm very proud of you. "
"Frasier: Oh Dad, you're back. How did things go with Mrs. Crowley? "
"Martin: Oh great, fabulous. Right up until the time she introduced me to my date. "
"Frasier: I thought she was your date. "
"Martin: So did I. Turns out my date was her mother. Eighty-six years young. I guess there was a little miscommunication when she invited me. "
"Frasier: Gee, I'm almost afraid to ask this; 'how was mom?' "
"Martin: Well, she was very nice. Sleepy. But she smiled a lot, showed me pictures of her great- grandchildren. She couldn't remember any of their names, but what the hell, she couldn't remember mine either. "
"Frasier: Well, I think we could all use a little something from the bar. "
"Martin: Well, I could use a big something. "
"Frasier: It hasn't been a good day all around. "
"Niles: Yeah, dad, uh... Maris and I have split up for good. "
"Martin: Oh, I'm sorry. "
"Niles: She-She's in love with someone else. "
"Martin: Oh, Niles. You all right? "
"Niles: Well, I will be. "
"Frasier: Well, this may come as small consolation to you, but I believe that you each have a lot of work to do to catch up to me in the failed romance department. Divorced twice, left at the alter once. "
"Martin: Well, I haven't exactly been burning things up lately. "
"Frasier: Thank you, dad. "
"Martin: Things with Sherry fizzled, then Sleeping Beauty tonight... "
"Martin: I think maybe I deserve the booby prize. "
"Niles: I'll challenge you Fifteen years with Maris, I end up in bed with her lover. "
"Martin: Geez, I didn't need to hear that "
"Niles: No, no, it was an accident. It was pitch dark, I thought he was Maris. "
"Frasier: It's a natural mistake. Uh, what tipped you off? "
"Niles: The heat from her side of the bed "
"Frasier: Well, I think we have a three-way tie. Here's to the Crane boys - love's big losers. "
"Niles: You know, I said I needed closure. But I won't have until I do one more thing. "
"Frasier: Oh, now be careful, Niles. You know, from this height that could hurt somebody. "
"Niles: All clear "
"Niles: Goodbye, Maris You've hurt me for the last time "
"Martin: Uh Niles, is that your Mercedes parked down there? "
"Martin: Whoa Oh well, a good body shop will be able to pound that out. "
"Frasier: Well, it's Saturday night. And here we are... again. "
"Martin: Wonder how many women are out there tonight without a date. "
"Niles: Thousands Thousands of opportunities for us to humiliate ourselves. "
"Frasier: Well, come and get us, Seattle Three Cranes, no waiting "
"Martin: We're desperate "
"Frasier: We're ludicrous "
"Niles: We're pathetic "

"Frasier: Oh well, good show today, Roz. I particularly thought that— "
"Roz: Oh my God, there's that Connie from Promotions. Every time she sees me, she hits me up for another charity. "
"Frasier: You know, Roz, maybe it's time you set some limits. Good lord, how hard can it be to say 'no' just once? Oh well, look who I'm talking to. "
"Connie: Hi, Frasier. Roz, I was looking for you— "
"Roz: O.K. wait, Connie, before you say anything, there's something I need to get off my chest. I have bought Girl Scout cookies from you, I have paid for your kids' band uniforms, I've bought tickets to every raffle your church ever had, and I'm tapped out. So whatever it is you came to say to me, I'm not interested. "
"Connie: Well, I'll just go then. Oh, by the way, my church had its raffle drawing yesterday. You won the grand prize. Sorry to bother you. "
"Roz: Oh, Connie, Connie, I'm sorry, Connie, don't — oh, who cares, what'd I win? "
"Roz: Oh my God It's that free ski weekend "
"Frasier: Oh, Roz "
"Roz: Listen to "
"this: 'Dear winner, you will enjoy a one-weekend rental of a deluxe private ski lodge on Mt. Baker, complete with lessons from a former Olympic champ' "
"Frasier: That is a grand prize indeed I must admit, I'm just a bit envious. Well, listen, I hope you have a wonderful weekend. "
"Roz: Well, thank you, Frasier. "
"Frasier: Just seems a pity you won't be able to take advantage of those ski lessons. "
"Roz: Well, there'll be other stuff to do. "
"Frasier: Oh, tons, tons Just because you can't ski — or for that matter hike, sled, or snowboard — doesn't mean you can't still curl up in by a roaring fire with a nice warm snifter of... oh, sorry. "
"Roz: Well, the scenery will be nice. "
"Frasier: Breathtaking I just hope you can endure the four-hour drive up there, and you so carsick these days... "
"Roz: OK, Frasier, I know what you're hinting at. This is the first thing I have ever won in my entire life, and it means something to me. So I'm not going to sell it, or give it away, or trade it for a... "
"Frasier: Big-screen TV? "
"Roz: Key's in the envelope. "
"Frasier: Thank you. "
"Daphne: What do you need that so loud for? I swear you've gone deaf as a post "
"Martin: It's just a cold stopping up my ears, I'll be fine. "
"Niles: Dear God, man, whose lawyer are you, anyway? No, I will not calm down They call that a settlement? You call them and turn it down. I said, turn it down, you ninny "
"Martin: Geez, you could at least ask nicely "
"Niles: I've got to get a new divorce lawyer. Claude is clearly no match for Maris's team. "
"Daphne: Real sharks, are they? "
"Niles: When we were courting, I sent Maris a valentine that said, 'You're the girl my heart adores, Everything I have is yours.' Now they're calling it a pre-nup. "
"Daphne: That's terrible Can you imagine using that as a weapon — an old valentine? "
"Martin: I'd love a cold Ballantine "
"Daphne: That does it You're getting a hearing aid, whether you like it or not "
"Martin: I don't need a hearing aid My hearing will be back to normal in no time. "
"Daphne: You said that two days ago. Soon you won't be able to hear a word I say. "
"Martin: Gee, wouldn't that be a tragedy? "
"Martin: I heard that. "
"Daphne: I didn't say anything "
"Frasier: Well, what are you all loitering around here for when you should all be packing? "
"Daphne: Packing for what? "
"Frasier: For the fabulous ski weekend I'm taking us on "
"Niles: You're kidding You won the raffle? "
"Frasier: In a manner of speaking. It's a gorgeous ski lodge, and an Olympic champion in residence to give us lessons "
"Daphne: Oh, sounds like heaven Skiing all weekend, then warming up with a nice hot rum drink, curled up under a blanket in front of a roaring fire... "
"Niles: I can feel the steam rising off my toddy already. "
"Daphne: Oh, damn I can't go. "
"Niles: Why not? "
"Daphne: My friend Annie. It's her birthday this weekend, and I promised I'd spend it with her. "
"Niles: Well, bring her along. "
"Daphne: Well, I know she'd love it. She's very gung-ho for sports. She was captain of the girls' rugby team at school. "
"Frasier: Well, I'm not sure how many bedrooms there are. "
"Niles: Well, if we're short, she can have mine. "
"Daphne: Where will you sleep? "
"Niles: Well, I'll think of something. "
"Daphne: Are you sure you wouldn't mind? "
"Frasier: Oh well, yes, why not? I mean, what could be more fun than a gung-ho girls' rugby captain? "
"Frasier: I will kill you for this "
"Niles: I'm sorry, but it was the only way Daphne was going to come, and if you think I was going to let a moonlit ski lodge go to waste, you can think again. "
"Frasier: You filed for divorce a week ago. Can't you wait awhile? "
"Niles: Wait? I have waited five long years for this. Dad, don't you think it's about time? "
"Martin: Uh, I got ten after five. "
"Frasier: Listen, Niles, if you want to make a fool of yourself with Daphne, that is your affair. But frankly, I will not have you ruin my ski weekend by inviting along this girl that sounds to me like an avalanche risk I'm going to tell Daphne, no guests "
"Daphne: I called Annie. She's all excited. Turns out she just bought new skis with the money she made off her new swimsuit calendar. "
"Frasier: Well, I hope you're happy. We're stuck with her now. "
"TO: "
"Niles: Wow, look at this place "
"Martin: Wow, look at this place Nothing like a change of scenery, huh? Where do you suppose the TV is? "
"Niles: At this altitude, I'm surprised my ears haven't stopped up. How's it affecting your ears, Dad? "
"Niles: Dad? "
"Martin: What? "
"Niles: How are your ears? "
"Martin: Great Never been better No hearing aid for me "
"Frasier: No need to struggle with that, Annie. I'll be back to help you in a moment. Oh, this place is terrific "
"Niles: Yes. I'm just glad we got here alive. The way you were taking those curves so sharply, poor Annie kept getting thrown up against you. "
"Frasier: Well, what can I say? I'm a bad driver. "
"Niles: I grant you she's comely, but don't you find her a tad — what would the polite euphemism be — stupid? "
"Frasier: Niles, she is just unschooled, like Liza Doolittle. Find her the right Henry Higgins, she'll be ready for a ball in no time "
"Niles: Leave it to you to put the 'pig' back in 'Pygmalion.' "
"Frasier: Thank you. "
"Daphne: Goodness, this place is just lovely "
"Frasier: Yes, isn't it, though? I mean, look at that vista, it's stunning Puts one in mind of the Matterhorn, doesn't it? "
"Annie: Oh, I wouldn't know. I'm not very musical. "
"Martin: Oh, that's a relief The way you were swerving on the ride up here, I was afraid these'd get broken. I'm gonna make us all a batch of my special hot buttered rum "
"Frasier: You're actually going to put butter in the rum? "
"Martin: It's cold in the mountains, you need a little fat in your booze. "
"Frasier: Good thinking, Dad. After we're done, I'll whip us up a nice batch of pork-nog. "
"Annie: None for me, thanks, I'm a vegetarian. "
"Niles: Daphne, let me help you with your luggage. "
"Daphne: Oh, thank you. "
"Niles: Uh, which room do you want? "
"Daphne: Oh... That one upstairs on the left should have a nice view. "
"Niles: What a coincidence, that's right next to mine. "
"Annie: Oh, I'll take the one next to that. "
"Frasier: Allow me. "
"Annie: That Niles is quite a cutey. Now he's the one getting divorced? "
"Daphne: Yeah. Poor thing's been just miserable. "
"Annie: Well, I may just have to cheer him up. "
"Daphne: You just leave Dr. Crane alone. No offense, but I've seen the way you go through men. The last thing he needs is for someone else to break his heart. "
"Annie: But it's my birthday And besides, you're not his nanny. "
"Daphne: Can't we just have a nice relaxing ski trip? Does this whole trip have to be about sex? "
"Guy: Allo. "
"Daphne: Hello. "
"Guy: I am Guy. "
"Daphne: Daphne. "
"Annie: Annie. "
"Guy: I hope you are ready to ski tomorrow. I'm going to work you very hard. "
"Daphne: Oh "
"Daphne: Dibs on the Frenchman. "
"Annie: You can have him. "
"Annie: He's not half as cute as Dr. Crane. "
"Frasier: Oh, enough already, my ears are burning "
"Daphne: Everyone, did you meet Guy, our ski instructor? "
"Frasier: Hello, Guy. "
"Guy: I will also be your chef tonight, Entrecôte a la Guy. "
"Niles: A ski champion and a gourmet — vous étés très formidable. "
"Guy: Parlez-vous francais? "
"Niles: Oui, j'ai habité à six mois à Paris quand j'étais un étudiant. "
"Guy: You speak very well. "
"Annie: Oui "
"Frasier: Oh, you speak French as well? "
"Annie: No, all I know how to say is 'oui.' "
"Frasier: Well, that should be enough to get you through the weekend. "
"Martin: Aw, look at that. Two deer in the snow, just kind of nuzzling each other. "
"Daphne: How romantic. "
"Frasier: Yes, it's enough to put ideas in one's head. "
"Annie: Isn't it? "
"Niles: Yes. "
"Daphne: I should say so. "
"Guy: Absolument. "
"Martin: Well, I guess I'd better start that rum cooking. "
"Daphne: Look at you — you're handy, a chef, a ski champ. Is there anything you don't do? "
"Guy: There are a few things. "
"Guy: Oh, Niles, you look très élégant "
"Niles: Yes, I simply had to change. After all that wine and good food, I felt I was going to burst out of my trousers. "
"Annie: Ooh, my "
"Daphne: Annie. "
"Daphne: Oh, Dr. Crane, what a smashing robe "
"Frasier: Thank you. "
"Daphne: Doesn't he look handsome? "
"Annie: Oh, yeah, quite. Oh, look — I've finished my buttered rum. "
"Frasier: Never let it be said that Frasier Crane would permit a lady to go thirsty. Daphne, why don't you see if Dad's finished with that second batch? "
"Daphne: Two more. "
"Martin: Almost there. I just need to replace some of this rum that's boiled off. "
"Daphne: Oh, yeah, just what Annie needs. She's all over poor Dr. Crane as it is, and after I begged her to leave him alone. Why couldn't she be hot for Frasier? "
"Martin: What? "
"Daphne: Annie — hot for Frasier "
"Martin: Oh. "
"Daphne: I should just forget about those two and concentrate on Guy. Now he's the sort of tall drink of water I could really go for. "
"Martin: Here you go. "
"Frasier: Oh, well, thank you, Dad, but actually it's the rum I'm interested in. I think it's just the thing I need to clinch things with Annie. "
"Martin: Oh, Annie, huh? I know something about that — she's hot for you. "
"Frasier: Says who? "
"Martin: Daphne. She said, 'Annie's hot for Frasier.' "
"Frasier: I knew my charms would win her over My God, I should register this dressing gown with the love police. "
"Annie: Oh, I know the pain you're going through. I mean, I've never been divorced myself, but my last boyfriend was... eventually. What you need is something to take your mind off it. [gets up and starts to sit down on his lap] I'll tell you what always works for me— "
"Daphne: Time to go upstairs "
"Annie: What for? "
"Daphne: I need to give you your birthday present. It's in my room. "
"Annie: I'll see you in a bit. "
"Guy: Allo. "
"Niles: Hi. "
"Guy: Your friend Daphne, she did not like the way Annie was flirting with you. "
"Niles: No, she didn't, did she? "
"Guy: In fact, she dragged Annie right off to her bedroom. "
"Niles: I think I know what that means. "
"Guy: I think we both know. Daphne was jealous. "
"Niles: She was jealous, wasn't she? I don't believe it "
"Guy: I am surprised by nothing. You know, I think you did not like Annie's flirting either. "
"Niles: Oh, was it that obvious? "
"Guy: Annie is not your... cup of tea? "
"Niles: Well, Just between us, my interests lie elsewhere this weekend. "
"Guy: Really? "
"Frasier: Rum's ready "
"Niles: Ah. Guy, perhaps you could help my dad with the drinks? "
"Guy: I am at your service. "
"Frasier: Thank you, Guy. "
"Niles: Daphne wants me "
"Frasier: She told you that? "
"Niles: Well, no. But Annie was flirting with me, and Daphne dragged her off to her room in a jealous rage "
"Frasier: No, no, no, Niles, Annie was not flirting with you. She's hot for me. "
"Niles: I think I know when I'm being flirted with. "
"Frasier: Oh, please, Niles, you're going beyond the limit that time. You're delusional Next thing, you'll be telling me that Guy's after you "
"Niles: All right, now you're dreaming things up... "
"Guy: How do you like your rum? "
"Martin: Well, it's kind of small, but it's got a nice view. "
"Guy: No, your rum. "
"Martin: Oh, yeah, yeah. Could you speak up a little? "
"Guy: I wonder if it's clouded my judgment about something. Your son Niles — is it my imagination, or is he attracted to—? "
"Martin: Hold it right there. It's not your imagination. He's got it bad. "
"Guy: Really? "
"Martin: Mmm. "
"Guy: This is not a delicate subject for you? "
"Martin: Oh, no, no. Niles has had those feelings for years. 'Course, I didn't encourage it during his so-called marriage, but now that he's free, whatever makes him happy — I say go for it "
"Guy: You are a wonderful father. "
"Martin: O.K., everybody, come and get it "
"Niles: Daphne, just in time. "
"Frasier: Annie, that's a lovely gown. "
"Annie: Daphne just gave it to me. "
"Guy: I'll bet she did. "
"Frasier: Mmm, Dad, this batch is even stronger than the last one "
"Martin: Yeah... first time I made this was for your mother. I'd been wanting to pop the question but I was afraid she'd say no. This gave me the nerve to ask her and I got myself a great big 'yes'... and that wasn't the only 'yes' I got from her that night either. Still scares me to think how close I came to chickening out, though. You know, as you get older, it's not the failures you regret, or the times you made an ass of yourself. It's the times you never even tried, when you just lost your nerve. "
"Frasier: Wise words. "
"Niles: Hear, hear. "
"Frasier: Faint heart never won fair lady. "
"Annie: I certainly hope that if a man fancied me, he wouldn't be afraid to take a chance, go for a bold gesture. "
"Niles: Yes, we must never be too timid to pursue our heart's desire. "
"Guy: And not give a damn what the world thinks... right, Miss Moon? "
"Daphne: Indeed. "
"Martin: Takes an hour to make one of these things, but it's worth it just to sit here and savor every sip. "
"Daphne: I'm done. "
"Niles: Time for bed. "
"Guy: I'm ready. "
"Annie: Me, too. "
"Frasier: 'Night, Dad. "
"Martin: What? You're not going to bed already, are you? Oh, fine. Goodnight. "
"Guy: Enjoy your rum "
"Martin: Well, I'd enjoy it more if it had a TV in it. "
"Niles: I thought Daphne's room was... "
"Frasier: They must have switched. "
"Annie: I took the wrong room. "
"Daphne: Yes, I thought we got that backwards. "
"Annie: Oh well, no harm done. "
"Frasier: Annie? "
"Niles: Daphne? "
"Frasier: Goodnight, Niles. "
"Niles: Goodnight. "
"Guy: Allo? "
"Daphne: Oh, hello. "
"Guy: I know what you want. Don't be timid — go for it "
"ROOM: "
"Niles: Daphne "
"ROOM: "
"Niles: Hello? It's Niles "
"Annie: Wait just a minute. "
"Niles: I can't wait, if I don't say this now I may lose my nerve. I need you I've wanted you since the moment I laid eyes on you "
"Annie: Oh, I feel the exact same way "
"Niles: Annie "
"Annie: I see you're surprised. Well, I've tried to send you signals tonight, but as usual I was too damned subtle. "
"Annie: Just promise me you won't mention this to Daphne. "
"Niles: My lips are sealed. "
"Annie: Not for long, I hope. "
"Niles: Come in "
"Niles: Guy "
"Guy: Niles, I thought I heard your voice in here. "
"Annie: What do you want? "
"Guy: Niles, you told me you wanted to see that thing. You know, in my room? "
"Niles: Oh yes Thank you for reminding me. "
"Annie: What thing? "
"Niles: Won't take long. I'll catch you later. "
"HALLWAY: "
"Niles: That was close I owe you a big one "
"Guy: Your room? "
"Niles: Oh, good point, Guy. She's bound to hear me in there. "
"Guy: We can go in my room. "
"Niles: It's much safer. No matter how hard I try, I'm bound to make noise. "
"Guy: Me too. "
"ROOM: "
"Niles: Daphne "
"Daphne: Dr. Crane "
"Guy: Miss Moon Is your room not satisfactory? "
"Daphne: Oh dear, I seem to have made a dreadful mistake. "
"Niles: What are you doing in Guy's room? "
"Daphne: Oh, is this Guy's room then? [laughs nervously] I was looking for Annie's room. "
"Guy: Oh, now it makes sense. "
"Daphne: I'll just go "
"Niles: Oh, wait for me. The hall is horribly dark, I'll show you the way. "
"Niles: My room should be safe now. "
"Guy: Very well, I'll see you later. "
"Niles: Excellent, yes. "
"HALLWAY: "
"Daphne: Dr. Crane. "
"Frasier: Oh... hello. What were the two of you doing in Guy's room? "
"Daphne: Just saying goodnight. "
"Niles: Now we're off to say goodnight to Annie. "
"Daphne: Goodnight to you, Dr. Crane. "
"Frasier: Oh, thank you. Uh, how long will you be with Annie? "
"Daphne: Just a minute or two. Is that champagne? "
"Frasier: Yes. I was just delivering it to... Dad. Well, carry on. "
"Niles: Before you see Annie, can you come to my room? "
"Daphne: What for? "
"Niles: There's something I need to tell you. "
"ROOM: "
"Niles: This may come as a surprise to you— "
"Daphne: Annie "
"Annie: Daphne "
"Daphne: Didn't I tell you to leave Dr. Crane alone? "
"Annie: And now I see why You wanted him all to yourself "
"Daphne: I do not want him all to myself "
"Annie: Oh, I see It's a threesome you're after Well, I don't do those anymore. "
"Niles: There's obviously been some kind of misunderstanding here. "
"Annie: I don't see how. You barged into my room not five minutes ago and told me how much you wanted me. "
"Daphne: You did? "
"Niles: Well, technically, yes— "
"Annie: Then as soon as this one bats her eyes, it's shove off, Annie This is the worst birthday I've ever had "
"Daphne: Oh, Dr. Crane, I'm sorry. I've ruined everything for you. "
"Niles: No, you haven't. Those things I said to Annie, I can explain— "
"Daphne: No, no, no, it's none of my business. I've had enough embarrassment for one night "
"Niles: But... "
"ROOM: "
"Daphne: Dr. Crane "
"Frasier: Daphne "
"Niles: Frasier You snake "
"Frasier: I'm sorry, wrong room "
"Daphne: Just get out of here, right now "
"Frasier: Next room I want, then? "
"Daphne: Just go "
"Frasier: Yes, bye-bye, sorry again "
"ROOM: "
"him: "
"Guy: Bonsoir. "
"Frasier: Guy "
"Guy: You are not the Crane I want "
"Frasier: You're not even the sex I want "
"Guy: Where is Niles? "
"Frasier: Oh, Niles? Company "
"Niles: Oh my God What are you doing in here with Guy? "
"Guy: Don't be jealous, Niles, it's not how it looks "
"Niles: Oh. WHAT? "
"Frasier: You know, much as I'd love to stay and help you two sort this thing out, there happens to be a very beautiful woman on the other side of this door who wants me desperately "
"Frasier: Annie "
"Annie: Aah Go away Get out "
"Daphne: What's going on? Guy "
"Annie: How dare you barge in on me when I'm naked "
"Frasier: I'm sorry My father told me you were hot for me "
"Annie: Your father did? "
"Frasier: Blame Daphne, she's the one who told him "
"Daphne: I did not I said she wanted your brother "
"Guy: Could Niles and I please have some privacy? "
"Annie: You're just putting the moves on everyone, aren't you? "
"Niles: Would you kindly get out of my bed? I am not gay, Guy. "
"Guy: Please, acknowledge your true nature Stop chasing these lesbians "
"Daphne: Lesbians? "
"Guy: Your father himself told me you wanted me "
"Niles: My father said I wanted you? "
"ensues: 'My father said what?' 'Who are you calling ' etc., etc. Finally Martin comes in. "
"Martin: Hey Hey Hey Hold it down, there are people here trying to sleep Oh, my ears must have popped. I can hear again "
"Martin: Well, goodnight all. "
"Niles: All right. We could discuss this till we've figured out every detail of what went on here tonight, but if you ask me, breakfast will be embarrassing enough as it is. I suggest we all forget this ever happened, and just go to bed. "
"Frasier: Oh, wait, wait, wait Wait, everybody [everyone stops and looks at him] Let me see if I've got this straight. All the lust coursing through this lodge tonight, all the hormones virtually ricocheting off the walls, and no one... was chasing me? "
"Frasier: See you at breakfast. "

"Frasier: Good afternoon, Betsy. I'm listening. "
"Betsy: Hi, Dr. Crane. My problem is that my husband wants to take me on a cruise for our anniversary. "
"Frasier: Well, that sounds enchanting. "
"Betsy: Yes, except I keep having this dream where I'm in a cabin asleep, and I see a drop of water beginning to leak up and at first it's just a trickle, but then it's a stream, and then it's gushing, pouring water everywhere and there's nothing in the world that I can do to stop this. "
"Frasier: That's a very powerful image, wouldn't you say so, Roz? [sees she has gone] Roz agrees. "
"Lilith: Excuse me, I'm looking for Frasier Crane, they said he was up here. "
"Roz: Lilith it's me, Roz... Doyle. "
"Lilith: Oh yes, Frasier's fun-loving producer.. [sees Roz's pregnant lump] ...who's apparently having a bit too much fun loving. "
"Roz: You know, I'd love to send one back at you, but I gotta pee "
"Frasier: Well that's all the time we have today. This is Dr. Frasier Crane, wishing you a good day and good mental... I'm sorry, someone just walked into the room and frightened me. It's, uh, my ex-wife, so if you're a regular listener you'll know what I'm talking about I'll see you Monday. "
"Frasier: Oh, hello Lilith. "
"Lilith: Surprise. "
"Frasier: Yeah well, we're past that now, aren't we? Well, what brings you to Seattle? "
"Lilith: I'm here for the national conference on self-psychology. "
"Frasier: Oh And how is Frederick? "
"Lilith: Fine. We have an amazing child. "
"Frasier: Yes, we have. And, uh, Brian? "
"Lilith: Fine. I have an amazing husband. "
"Frasier: Yes, yes. So, did you two get that gift basket I sent you for the holidays? "
"Roz: What did you do to her? "
"Frasier: Nothing, I sent her a gift basket, fruits and festive nuts "
"Lilith: Oh, it's not the basket, you nit It's Brian... he left me. "
"Roz: Maybe I should go. "
"Lilith: Oh no, everyone else knows, you might as well know it too. Brian was looking for someone a bit more feminine... and he found him "
"Lilith: Oh, Stan Jablonski, that little hussy "
"Frasier: Oh, Lilith, oh, I am genuinely sorry. "
"Lilith: I didn't know where to turn, but I knew somehow you'd be here for me. "
"Frasier: So you didn't come for the conference? "
"Lilith: No. "
"Frasier: You know, you really shouldn't be alone tonight. Er, Niles and I are atending a reception at the Union Club, would you like to join us? "
"Lilith: Oh thank you Frasier, I'd love to. I don't if I deserve your compassion, but I feel better already just holding your strong comforting hands. "
"Frasier: You know I'll always be here for you. "
"Lilith: Oh, I could stay in these arms all day. "
"Frasier: Ah, yes - well, em, you'll have to excuse me. I have an appointment, station manager, very important, can't be broken. I'll, em, see you tonight. Bye bye. "
"Roz: Hey, that's rough; leaving you for another man Did you have any idea? "
"Lilith: No, none at all. Stan was a contractor we had hired to extend our master bedroom. It's ironic, isn't it - no sooner do I get the closet of my dreams than my husband comes out of it. "
"Frasier: Hello, Niles. "
"Niles: Ah, Frasier. "
"Frasier: Mmm, that bun looks good. "
"Niles: Now, now, remember your diet. "
"Frasier: Speaking of buns I could do without, Lilith is back "
"Niles: Oh, that explains why blood was pouring from all my faucets this morning. "
"Frasier: Now go easy on her. Her husband has left her, and get "
"this: for a man. "
"Niles: Damn I owe Dad five dollars "
"Frasier: Poor thing, she's obviously devastated - her entire world has been turned upside down. Oh, look who I'm talking to. No one knows better than you how much a messy divorce can leave one... "
"Frasier: ...strangely relaxed Niles? Niles "
"Niles: Yes? "
"Frasier: Am I boring you? "
"Niles: Did I do it again? I'm sorry Frasier, it seems I'm suffering through a bout of narcolepsy. "
"Frasier: Good lord When did this start? "
"Niles: Right after we started divorce proceedings. I checked with my doctor, I'm fine - it's a reaction to stress. It's my way of escaping the whole ugly mess But I'm terribly sorry, go on with what you were saying. "
"Frasier: Well, obviously Lilith is distraught and she's come to me to help her make sense of the whole thing. I find it just a bit disconcerting. "
"Niles: How so? "
"Frasier: Well, we have a destructive "
"pattern: whenever she comes to me in need I find her vulnerability highly desirable; against my better judgment we end up in bed and I'm left with feelings of regret. "
"Niles: And you felt this way about her today? "
"Frasier: Oh baby "
"Niles: Well, do your best to avoid her. "
"Frasier: Well, I can't She's joining us at the Union Club tonight. "
"Niles: What, she's going to be there? "
"Frasier: Come on Niles, it's just a bunch of stuffed shirts talking about their portfolios and prostates. "
"Niles: Exactly, and you've ruined it "
"Niles: Damn, it's one of Maris's cadre of lawyers. Er, we've been over that. No, I can't. How dare you? She already has the house I'm not even allowed to visit the koi pond Uh-huh. Uh-huh... "
"Niles: ...I'm not even allowed to visit the koi pond "
"Frasier: Give me that He will call you back. Lord, aren't we a "
"pair: a narcoleptic and a weak-willed sexual obsessive. We're like a couple of brothers out of an O'Neill play "
"TO: "
"Martin: Hey Daph', come down here, I taught him a new trick. "
"Daphne: Oh, I love animal tricks. You know, I was reading in a movie magazine where there's this stunt dog who they taught to ride a motorcycle into a burning building, pick up a baby in its teeth, then jump out the window to safety. What did you teach Eddie? "
"Martin: To roll over. "
"Daphne: You must be very proud. "
"Martin: Ah, forget it, Eddie "
"Martin: Hello, Niles. "
"Niles: Evening, dad, Daphne. "
"Frasier: Hello, Niles. Sherry? I think we have time before Lilith arrives. "
"Martin: What? You never said she was coming up here "
"Daphne: You just said you were going to dinner "
"Martin: You never said she was coming up here "
"Frasier: It's just to rendezvous, it's all of two minutes. "
"Martin: But you never told me You've been home an hour and you never told me, not a word, did he say anything to you? "
"Daphne: No, nothing. You could have told us, you know, we could have made plans to be elsewhere. "
"Martin: How come you didn't know about it? You used to know these things, whenever she came around you'd get a headache "
"Frasier: Alright, she's coming Both of you suck it up Lilith has had a devastating week; her husband has left her. The least you could do is show a little compassion, unless you'd like to hide in your rooms because two minutes of polite conversation with a woman in need is too much to ask "
"Martin: Outta my way "
"Daphne: Me too "
"Martin: Leave it "
"Niles: Remember Frasier, I'm here for you in case you feel yourself starting to weaken. "
"Frasier: Oh I'm fine, believe "
"me: I'm in complete control "
"Frasier: Oh baby "
"Lilith: Thank you Frasier, I needed that. I treated myself to a little shopping this afternoon. Probably just a pathetic attempt to compensate for the battering my ego's taken recently - it's pretty transparent, huh? "
"Frasier: No, but if you stand in the light maybe... "
"Niles: Frasier "
"Lilith: Niles, sorry to hear your marriage ended in a shambles. "
"Niles: Ditto. "
"Frasier: Now that we've got the pleasantries out of the way, let me take your wrap. "
"Frasier: Yowsa Oh Lilith, that dress is stunning. "
"Niles: Frasier, may I see you in the kitchen? "
"Frasier: No "
"Lilith: It's from a new Couture line called 'Encore' "
"Frasier: Well... bravo I can almost feel the curtain rising "
"Niles: Frasier Excuse us, we'll be right back. Eddie will entertain you. "
"Lilith: Hello, Eddie. "
"Frasier: Damn her lily-white hide She knows what she's doing dressing like that That woman plays me like a lute – well, I guess you know a thing or two about that Huh I've got all the resistance of a horny stag Niles, you've gotta help me get through this... Niles "
"Niles: Did I do it again? "
"Frasier: Yes, you fell asleep with your cheek right next to the ice tray "
"Niles: Oh, that's so strange. I dreamt I was tangoing with Maris "
"Frasier: Niles, I need your help resisting Lilith "
"Niles: Alright, alright, let me think, let me think... I think I have the answer. When you feel yourself yielding to her, summon an image so repellant you will be incapable of any sexual desire. Remember the summer we were at Uncle Henry's farm and found that dead horse lying in the hot sun crawling with maggots? "
"Frasier: Yes, of course. "
"Niles: Hold onto that picture. You can ride that horse to safety. "
"Frasier: Thank you, Niles, that just might do the trick. When it comes to an ugly image, you can't beat a dead horse [guns down his drink] "
"Niles: Feel up to facing her again? "
"Frasier: Yes Let her bat her eyes all she wants to, she can push her breasts up to Canada, I won't budge "
"TO: "
"Lilith: Morning. "
"Niles: Morning. "
"Time: 10"
":00) "
"Lilith: My God What did we do? What did we do? "
"Niles: Well, first you put your... "
"Lilith: I know what we did What do we do now? "
"Niles: Let's just stay calm. These things happen, they happen every day... every day in Arkansas '] "
"Niles: Frasier is going to kill us Oh, why did you have to look so damned bewitching all evening? "
"Lilith: Why did you have to drive me home and walk me to my door? "
"Niles: Oh, there's no point pointing fingers. We both know why this happened; last night was simply two wounded people overcome with loneliness, confusion and... "
"Lilith: Tequila shooters. "
"Niles: Mmm-hmm. "
"Niles: Who's that? "
"Lilith: Don't panic, no one knows we're here. "
"Niles: I told Frasier I was driving you home. "
"Lilith: Why did you do a stupid thing like that? "
"Niles: Well, it wasn't stupid at the time How did I know the minute we got in this room you'd be on me like a hawk on a titmouse "
"Lilith: Just be quiet. Who is it? "
"Waiter: Room Service, ma'am. "
"Lilith: Ah that's right, we ordered breakfast last night. "
"Waiter: Good morning ma'am, good morning sir. I have Eggs Benedict and Eggs Florentine. "
"Lilith: Did you bring ketchup? "
"Waiter: Uh, no. Sorry, let me get that for you right now. "
"Niles: Ketchup on Eggs Florentine? "
"Waiter: Oh Your, uh, first breakfast together? "
"Lilith: Just get it "
"Niles: Now I remember ordering this; it's the breakfast I always have after a night of passion. "
"Lilith: Eggs Benedict? That's very rich. "
"Niles: I only have it once a year. "
"Lilith: That was quick. "
"Frasier: Lilith, are you awake? "
"Lilith: It's Frasier "
"Niles: Oh my God What do we do? "
"Lilith: Hide in the bathroom "
"Niles: Right "
"Niles: No, not you "
"Frasier: Lilith? "
"Lilith: Wait, take the cart with you [pushes it into bathroom with Niles] "
"Niles: Wait Food in the bathroom? "
"Lilith: Oh, just go "
"Lilith: Hello, Frasier. What are you doing here? "
"Frasier: Surrendering, Lilith. I'm yours "
"Lilith: Oh - no... "
"Frasier: Oh please, don't punish me for playing hard to get last night It took everything I had to resist you. "
"Lilith: Oh, this isn't right... "
"Frasier: Oh, who cares? You're gonna tell me that when you were lying in your bed last night you weren't thinking about me? "
"Lilith: Yes "
"Frasier: Oh, drop the mask, Lilith We both know why you came to Seattle. We both know why you dressed so enticingly last night. "
"Lilith: Oh, well... "
"Frasier: There's someone in your bathroom? "
"Lilith: No, it's a defective toilet. It's been doing that all night, I think I'll just go check it now. "
"Lilith: Niles "
"Niles: Yes? "
"Lilith: You fell asleep and flushed the toilet "
"Niles: Damn Is he still here? "
"Lilith: Yes. He wants to make love to me. "
"Niles: Does the man have no scruples? He specifically asked me last night to keep him away from you. But the minute my back is turned he sneaks back here - and yes, I'm aware of the irony. "
"Lilith: I'll just ask him to leave. "
"Lilith: My God "
"Frasier: My Goddess "
"Lilith: Go away "
"Waiter: But I've got your ketchup, ma'am. "
"Lilith: Not necessary. "
"Waiter: OK, but I still need the bill. "
"Lilith: Later. "
"Frasier: Well, let's just take care of this... "
"Waiter: I'm sorry to disturb you, but here's the... [realizes it’s a different man] ketchup. Sorry it took so... long. I, er, still need the bill. Where's the cart? "
"Lilith: In the bathroom. "
"Frasier: Why is the breakfast cart in the bathroom? "
"Lilith: Ah, I was going to take a hot bath while I ate. "
"Frasier: Still, food in the bathroom? "
"Lilith: Be right back. "
"Frasier: Well, this is a little embarrassing. My ex-wife, we're sort of reconnecting. "
"Waiter: Yes sir, that's ...er... wonderful. "
"Frasier: You never know, it might just work out this time. "
"Waiter: Oh...kay. "
"Lilith: There's a generous, generous tip in there for you. "
"Waiter: Thank you, ma'am. "
"Frasier: Say, listen - while you're still here, why don't you send up an order of Eggs Benedict? There's no reason why she should eat alone. "
"Waiter: Oh...kay. "
"Frasier: Now, where were we? "
"Lilith: Oh, this isn't a good time for this, really. "
"Frasier: Why not? Lilith, please, we're alone, we're here, you need your Frasier- "
"Frasier: What the hell was that? "
"Lilith: No, Frasier, wait, don't go in there Wait "
"Frasier: Niles "
"Niles: "
"Frasier: My God "
"Lilith: Frasier, I'm sorry, we didn't mean for this to happen... "
"Frasier: OH MY GOD "
"Niles: It was a mistake, a horrible, misguided mistake- "
"Frasier: Stop it, Niles Stop it Don't tell me how or why, I've just got to get out of here "
"Lilith: Oh, Frasier, Frasier "
"Niles: This is my worst nightmare. "
"Lilith: You have egg on your face. "
"Niles: That is an understatement "
"Lilith: No, actual egg "
"Lilith: It's in your hair too "
"Niles: I knew you couldn't stay mad at us. "
"Frasier: I'm in a bathrobe, you jackass "
"Lilith: I can understand your shock, and believe me, if I could erase everything that happened last night, I would. But, if you could just look at this rationally, just for a moment - we didn't technically do anything wrong. "
"Frasier: What? You didn't do anything wrong? "
"Niles: I'm a little unclear on that myself, but I'm willing to go along with it "
"Lilith: You and I are no longer married. Neither is Niles. I won't say this is my shining hour, but we are not responsible to you or anyone else for our actions. "
"Frasier: You're actually defending what you did? "
"Lilith: Just listen; the past few days have been THE worst of my life. I have never been less self-assured, or more in need of validation, both as a person and especially as a woman. Niles was feeling the same thing. "
"Niles: Exactly. Wait a minute... "
"Lilith: Our physical reaction to each other was nothing more than a desperate attempt to reaffirm our own worth. "
"Frasier: Well... that is very impressive, Dr. Sternin. But I too happen to be a psychiatrist. Let me tell you what actually transpired. This was a passive-aggressive manifestation of your deep resentments towards me. Niles, you were punishing me for my notoriety. You, for my successful adjustment after our divorce. It is this shared bond that brought the two of you to your palace of sweet revenge "
"Lilith: Allow me to "
"rebut: what a crock "
"Frasier: It is not "
"Lilith: It is so This is yet another example of your complete self- absorption, which is the reason we could not stay together in the first place "
"Frasier: I have a right to... Why am I defending myself? "
"Niles: If you ask me, you are both off the mark. Last night was about two people, ruled by very powerful superegos - tortured by them, who found a chance - however misguided - to break through and rediscover their ids together. Call me an old softie, but that's how I see it. "
"Frasier: OK, then... the three of us have certainly analyzed the CRAP out of this "
"Niles: Yes, where do we all go from here? "
"Frasier: I don't know. "
"Lilith: You realize that if you had simply given into me last night instead of this morning, the three of us would not be in this hell. "
"Frasier: No, it would be the two of us in a whole different hell "
"Niles: Well, I don't give a damn I've been manipulated by you jackals enough, I'll see you in court [puts phone away] The very idea that Maris still thinks she can... [still alert] Hey, I'm not sleepy. That conversation should have put me out like a light "
"Lilith: Well, it's not surprising. Your experience with Maris has been emasculating. Last night may have gone a long way towards restoring your self-confidence. "
"Niles: Of course And by the same token you can now give up the neurotic assumption that Brian left you because you are unattractive. You have ample evidence to the contrary. "
"Lilith: Yes, I have Well, to hell with Brian If he wants a prissy little wife, he can keep Stan "
"Frasier: So, isn't this peachy Everything's turned out just fine for everyone. You two have solved your problems, the waiter received a handsome tip, Niles and I have matching bathrobes, and looky here It's not even nine- thirty yet "
"Lilith: Frasier, try to understand... "
"Niles: Yes, what happened last night was just... "
"Frasier: Oh, stop it, both of you Enough It happened, and I'm just going to have to deal with it. I suppose in a twisted way there is one positive for me in "
"this: you see, Lilith, I have never stopped desiring you - even though we are completely wrong for each other But now, from this day forward, whenever I look at you, I will see the back of my brother's head And that is one bucket of ice water, let me tell ya "
"Lilith: You know, Frasier... "
"Frasier: Enough, Lilith. "
"Lilith: Alright. Maybe, I'll just go... have some breakfast. [she exits to bathroom] "
"Niles: Are we OK? "
"Frasier: No, we're not... but we will be. "
"Niles: Well, that's enough for now. We're an odd little family, aren't we? "
"Waiter: Here's your Eggs Benedict, if you could just... "
"Waiter: Oh...kay "
"Time: 21"

"Frasier: Well, that's all the time we have for this afternoon, Seattle. This is Dr. Frasier Crane, wishing you good afternoon, and good mental health. "
"Roz: Frasier, if I ask your opinion about something, will you give me an honest answer and not just tell me what you think I want to hear? "
"Frasier: Absolutely, Roz. Anytime, all you have to do is ask. "
"Roz: Oh, I knew it. "
"Frasier: Oh, no, no, Roz, I'm just kidding. I love it "
"Roz: Really? "
"Frasier: Yes, it looks great. "
"Roz: Are you sure? "
"Frasier: Trust me. "
"Roz: OK. It's just in my condition I'm just a little insecure. You know, every time I see something cute in the window, I remember how I look and I think, 'no way.' "
"Roz: Here we go again. "
"Frasier: Gosh, that's my cousin Nikos What are you doing here? "
"Nikos: I was in the neighborhood, I thought I'd stop by "
"Frasier: Oh, it's great to see you My God, it's been ages. Oh yes, I'd like you to meet my producer, Roz Doyle. "
"Roz: Hi. "
"Frasier: This is Nikos, my father's brother's son. "
"Roz: Well, I would have never pegged you for a Crane. "
"Frasier: Oh, well, he's half Greek. He gets his looks from his mom. "
"Roz: I'll bet he gets looks from lots of women. "
"Frasier: Roz "
"Nikos: It's nice to meet you. "
"Roz: Yeah, you too. You know, I never knew Frasier had a cousin. "
"Nikos: I think he's ashamed of me. Why else would he turn down an invitation to my wedding? "
"Frasier: You're getting married? "
"Nikos: Yeah, on Saturday. Don't tell me you didn't get the invitation. "
"Frasier: Well, no, it's the first I'm hearing of it "
"Nikos: I knew it. I knew Mom wasn't telling the truth. She said she never heard back from you. "
"Frasier: She must still be nursing that grudge. "
"Roz: Uh-oh, this sounds like, you know, personal, private, family stuff. So, what's this grudge you're talking about? "
"Nikos: Oh, it's all so silly. Mom has never forgiven Frasier for some career advice he gave me. And, trust me, he saved me from going down the wrong path. "
"Frasier: Well, thank you, Nikos. Well, I'd certainly hate to miss this wedding. I wonder if there's some way we could work this out. You want to go grab a cup of coffee? "
"Nikos: Sure. "
"Frasier: Great "
"Roz: So, what was the wrong path? "
"Frasier: Oh, Roz, it's rather a long story— "
"Nikos: My folks wanted me to go to medical school. "
"Roz: Ah, so what path did you choose instead? "
"Frasier: We don't really have the time to into all that right now— "
"Nikos: I became a juggler. I perform on street corners. "
"Roz: Ah, I see. And all because of his advice. Tell me, do people sometimes toss you coins? "
"Nikos: Sure, lots of times. "
"Roz: Well, here's something you can catch them in. "
"Martin: You and your damned advice "
"Daphne: Mr. Crane, Dr. Rudnik asked me to monitor your blood pressure, and I'd like to get an accurate reading. "
"Frasier: Stop pointing fingers. Why don't we try to solve this problem? "
"Martin: I don't see how She's a vindictive woman, and she's gonna keep on punishing us because of you If you kept your big trap shut for just once in your life, my nephew would probably be a surgeon now, and I'd be going to his wedding "
"Daphne: There, now — 240 over 11. Sounds about right "
"Niles: Personally, I'd have loved to have gone, but this is clearly a snub and we Crane men have our pride. Right, Dad? "
"Frasier: Oh, stop it, Niles You're just afraid of seeing Cousin Yvonne, aren't you? "
"Daphne: Who's Cousin Yvonne? "
"Frasier: Oh, a distant cousin who has a slight crush on Niles. "
"Niles: 'A slight crush?' There are cannibals who are less man- hungry. "
"Daphne: That's funny, I've always thought it would be kind of romantic to have a secret admirer, someone who longed for me that much. But I do see your point, Dr. Crane. When you think about it, it is kind of sick. "
"Niles: Yeah, well, perhaps 'sick' is a tad judgmental. "
"Martin: I can't believe that because of your big mouth, Zora won't even let me in her restaurant "
"Frasier: Forcing you to go elsewhere when you have one of your frequent cravings for stuffed grape leaves and zither music "
"Niles: It's a moot point. We're not invited, thanks to Frasier's more-than-usually inept advice. "
"Martin: Can you imagine what it's like to live in the same city as your brother, and not see him for five years? "
"Frasier: No, but I'd like to give it a try. Dad, I think that we should go to this wedding. "
"Martin: Forget it, Zora doesn't want us there. "
"Frasier: But Nikos wants us there My God, I watched that boy grow up I want to be there when he gets married "
"Daphne: I'd like to venture an opinion here. I know this doesn't exactly concern me, but I feel very strongly about this. I like zither music, and I always have "
"Frasier: And we're back Listen, Dad— "
"Martin: No, drop it, Frasier. If my brother's wife doesn't see fit to invite me, I am not just going to show up. "
"Niles: End of story, case closed, that's all she wrote "
"Frasier: Oh, stop it, Niles. There are more important issues at stake here than you being mauled by Yvonne the Terrible Dad is hurt, can't you see that? He misses his brother. Well, it's my fault, and I'm going to put it right. [picks up the phone and dials] I'm going to get in touch with Aunt Zora. Surely she'll listen to reason. Aunt Zora? [she hangs up] Well, that's encouraging. She remembered my voice. "
"Niles: Frasier, just give up. "
"Frasier: No She can't avoid me if I go down and meet her face-to- face. I'm going to go to that restaurant. "
"Niles: Do you have a death wish? She'll eat you alive "
"Frasier: Oh, I'm not afraid of her "
"Niles: Everyone is Have you forgotten the family legend that when Hitler invaded Greece she joined the partisans just so she could strangle Nazis? "
"Frasier: I have never believed that. She would have to have been five years old at the time "
"Niles: Well, that's why the legend says they were strangled with jump ropes. "
"Frasier: Stop it "
"TO: "
"Zora: Dmitri, pick up your order, don't make me hurt you again "
"Frasier: Aunt Zora, I realize I'm not the most welcome person here, but— "
"Frasier: It is not fair to take my mistake out on your husband, or my father "
"Frasier: They didn't do anything "
"Zora: More pepper "
"Frasier: You have a wedding coming up, you should be joyous "
"Zora: Sponge off this countertop "
"Frasier: Nikos tells me his fiancée’s a lovely young woman from a wealthy family, that you like her very much "
"Zora: Mop up this slop "
"Frasier: So your heart should be brimming with motherly emotions "
"Zora: When I find out who bent this skewer, I'm ramming it right in his eye "
"Frasier: You know, I've always wanted to do "
"this: make a trip around the Greek Islands "
"Frasier: Aunt Zora, my point is that we are family, and we should be together. And I promise that if you invite us to this wedding, I will never give Nikos another piece of advice for as long as I live. "
"Frasier: I'm through meddling, you have my word. And if you do invite us to the wedding, I also promise that I'll promote this wonderful, wonderful restaurant of yours on my radio program. "
"Frasier: Every day for a... month? "
"Zora: "
"Frasier: You forgive me "
"Zora: Of course, of course And you don't just come to the wedding You come to the rehearsal dinner too Tomorrow night, right here, because we are family Here, eat "
"Zora: My very special kokaretski, for a very special nephew Oh God, I'm such a softie I'll be crying in a minute "
"Frasier: Me, too "
"Niles: Well, I hope you enjoy yourself, Mr. Blessed-Are-the- Peacemakers "
"Frasier: Will you stop complaining? The rehearsal went beautifully. Cousin Yvonne didn't even get near you. "
"Niles: How could she? I spent half the time hiding in the confessional By the way, Mrs. Pappas is having an affair. "
"Zora: There they are, my two favorite nephews Ed, get me with the boys You know, I am so glad you are coming to the wedding tomorrow. There is nothing sadder than a divided family, am I right? "
"Frasier: Quite right. "
"Niles: Absolutely, absolutely. When Frasier told me we weren't invited to the wedding, I— "
"Yvonne: There you are, Niles "
"Niles: Just kill me now. "
"Niles: Hello, Yvonne. "
"Yvonne: I haven't seen you two in a long time "
"Niles: Oh well, I haven't seen your two in a long time — 'you, too,' 'you, too' "
"Yvonne: Oh, well, we've got a lot of catching up to do. Let's go get us a glass of bubbly "
"Niles: Oh, you know, I don't think so— "
"Zora: Oh, go on, enjoy it's none of that sissy French wine, it's real Greek champagne "
"Frasier: Ooh, save some for me Niles "
"snobs: 'champagne' properly refers only to the "
"Zora: And here he is, my favorite brother-in-law Martin, it's been too long "
"Martin: It sure has. Say, where's Walt? We got a lot of catching up to do. "
"Zora: Oh, don't worry, he'll be here. Who is this pretty young thing? "
"Martin: Oh, this is Daphne Moon. She's my physical therapist. "
"Zora: Oh. That's what they call it these days? [slaps him playfully] You dirty old man ' etc., etc. "
"Nikos: This is my fiancée, Mary-Ann Taubeneck. "
"Frasier: Mary-Ann, it's a pleasure. Taubeneck? As in the Taubeneck Building? "
"Ann: Yeah, and Taubeneck Park, etc., etc. That was my grandfather, the original robber baron. "
"Nikos: Mary-Ann has some issues with her family. "
"Ann: Look at them sulking over there. You should have seen their faces when I told them I was marrying a street person. "
"Nikos: Performer. Street performer. "
"Ann: Oh, right. Anyway, they've got it coming after all the debutante nonsense they put me through. Would you excuse me? "
"Nikos: Great, isn't she? "
"Frasier: Yes. How did you meet? "
"Nikos: A few months back, I performed at one of her parents' garden parties. They were really snooty to me. That seemed to spark something in her. She asked me for a date right in front of them. That's how she is. She likes to play with her parents' heads. "
"Frasier: Yes, well, so did Lizzie Borden. "
"Nikos: What do you mean? "
"Frasier: Oh, I can't help thinking that... nothing. Just a bad joke. She seems like a lovely girl. "
"Nikos: Yeah, she really is. My family adores her. You should hear my mom, she thinks Crystal's the best thing that ever happened to me. "
"Frasier: Crystal? "
"Nikos: Did I say that? I mean Mary-Ann. I must have been admiring the beautiful crystal over there, that's why I called her crystal. "
"Frasier: Yes, it's a good thing you weren't admiring the pork-butt "
"Nikos: I'm so nervous these days, I don't know what I'm saying. I guess it's just a case of pre-wedding jitters, right? "
"Zora: Nikos, Nikos, go check on the sous-chef, make sure he isn't into the ouzo "
"Zora: Last time, he drank until he got his head caught in the duck press. "
"Frasier: Oh, really? How did he manage that? "
"Zora: With my help. So, what were you and Nikos talking about? "
"Frasier: Oh, now, now, now, Aunt Zora, don't you worry. I made you a promise, and I'd die before I'd break it. "
"Zora: Or soon after. So, you met Mary-Ann? "
"Frasier: Yes, yes, lovely girl. You must be very proud. "
"Zora: Oh, and relieved Do you know that crazy son of mine was going steady with a juggler for three years? Crystal- somebody. Can you imagine having a daughter-in-law who throws things for a living? It's embarrassing. "
"Zora: DANCE, people Let us celebrate tonight "
"Martin: Hey, Frasier, thanks for settling everything with Zora. "
"Frasier: Oh, it's my pleasure, Dad. "
"Martin: But, you know, I can't find Walt. I've been waiting five years for this reunion. "
"Frasier: Must be here somewhere. Now, did you know that Nikos and Mary-Ann have only known each other for— "
"Martin: Oh, there he is "
"Frasier: Well, this is so exciting You two must have so much to talk about Uncle Walt, hello "
"Walt: Frasier Marty... "
"Martin: Walt... "
"Walt: What's new? "
"Martin: Oh, same-old, same-old. How's tricks? "
"Walt: Eh, can't complain. They keeping you busy? "
"Martin: Oh, better believe it. "
"Walt: Well, what're you gonna do? "
"Martin: Tell me about it. "
"Frasier: It's amazing how you two can pick up right where you left off. "
"TO: Later "
"Niles: Psst Put those back "
"Frasier: Niles Do you realize how pathetic this is? "
"Niles: I don't care At dinner, Zora announced that I'd filed for divorce Within seconds, Yvonne began purring so loudly my allergies kicked in I won't be safe until this wedding is over "
"Frasier: The wedding I'm beginning to think might just be a serious mistake. "
"Niles: Ooh, I like the sound of that. Does this mean you're going to meddle and get us both thrown out? "
"Frasier: I can't I promised I wouldn't "
"Niles: Oh, dear God, here she comes again "
"Yvonne: Hi, Frasier, have you seen Niles? "
"Frasier: Why, no, I haven't. "
"Yvonne: Oh "
"TO: Later "
"Martin: Here we go. "
"Daphne: How much longer do we have stay? "
"Martin: What are you in such a snit about? "
"Daphne: This lot. Thanks to your sister-in-law they're all sniggering about me being your 'physical therapist.' "
"Martin: Oh, don't let it bother you. She's always been a pain. "
"Daphne: You're telling me. Dried-up old grape leaf "
"Martin: Yeah, and she's one to talk about reputations, too Between you and me, before she married my brother, she was easier to make than a peanut butter sandwich "
"Daphne: Does everyone know that? "
"Martin: Well, everybody except my brother. I mean, I love him dearly, but he's not exactly the brightest bulb in the, uh... "
"Daphne: Bulb box? "
"Martin: Yeah. Shh, here's Eddie Hey, Eddie Where's the camera? "
"Ed: Aha, then it worked. It's right here. "
"Ed: I decided to go undercover. I wanted to get people just being themselves. "
"Martin: Oh well, we were really boring, believe me Why don't you just rewind it a few minutes and tape over it? "
"Ed: Funny. Mrs. Pappas said the same thing. "
"Frasier: So, why did you and this Crystal break up? I mean, I'm not meddling, I'm just curious, that's all. "
"Nikos: It was a career conflict. She's a juggler, too. You may have heard of her — Crystal Baker? "
"Frasier: No. I, uh, don't get to street theatre as often as I should. "
"Nikos: Fabulous performer. Fabulous girl, for that matter. But, she wanted to work in Paris and I wanted to stay here. "
"Frasier: Yes, well, there's always pressure on the two-career family. "
"Nikos: We had a big fight about it. Then Mary-Ann came along. By the time Crystal got back, I was engaged. "
"Frasier: And how did she take the news? "
"Nikos: She was crushed. But she's been wonderful, like she called me a few nights ago to congratulate me. We talked for hours, just like old times. She's a sweetheart. "
"Frasier: Yes, she's starting to sound like one. "
"Nikos: Yeah, it was really great talking with her. I felt happy... purely happy. Maybe the last time I did. I mean, since then it's been all the usual pre-wedding stuff. You know, the jitters, night-sweats, vomiting. "
"Frasier: Nikos, I promised your mother that I would never again interfere in your life— "
"Nikos: Interfere? You saved me from making a terrible mistake I-I value your advice above anything. "
"Frasier: All right, then. In the interests of your future happiness, I feel it's my duty to let you know— "
"Zora: Nikos, please go make your Uncle Stavros to stop dancing on the table. "
"Zora: Just once it would be nice to have a family gathering where no one leaves in an ambulance, am I right? "
"Frasier: Yes, wouldn't it? "
"Martin: Hey, Eddie, come on, you've been working ever since I've been here You haven't even had a chance to chow down "
"Ed: Well, I wouldn't mind grabbing a bite. "
"Martin: Well, hand me that thing, then. I know how to run that baby. "
"Ed: Be careful, that tape is historic "
"Martin: Oh. "
"Ed: I have interviewed every single living member of the family. I even went out to the retirement home and taped Nikos's great-grandmother — 101 years old. "
"Martin: That's amazing. Wow, 101. Gosh, that's older than the century. She probably has got more stories than anybody else has... I can't do this. "
"Daphne: Think you have to press this button right here. "
"Martin: Oh, thanks. "
"Martin: Bye "
"Zora: OK, everybody, gather round, we're going to have some toasts here So, if everybody will stop what they're doing for just one minute and come closer... "
"Frasier: For God's sake, Niles, why don't you just hide in the men's room? "
"Niles: Where do you think Yvonne is right now? Where have you been? "
"Frasier: Well, I've been on the phone. I've been trying to contact Nikos's ex-girlfriend. "
"Niles: The depths you'll sink to to get a date. "
"Frasier: I am convinced that he's still in love with her, and she with him I thought if I could get the two of them together he might realize it in time. Niles, I couldn't reach her, she's out working tonight. I had to leave a message with her roommate. "
"Niles: Well, perhaps the time has come for you to— "
"Yvonne: Hi. "
"Frasier: Hello, Yvonne. "
"Niles: -stop playing games and start being direct "
"Zora: Frasier? Where's Frasier Crane? "
"Frasier: Oh, dear God. "
"Zora: Ah, there you are Come up here and make a toast to the happy couple "
"Frasier: Well, all right, I guess a thought or two comes to mind. Well, I've known Nikos all his life, and I'm sure that he realizes marriage is a binding commitment, not to be entered into hastily— "
"Zora: But when the right one comes along, you know it Hmm? "
"Frasier: And that it's very important to-to find the person that you're most compatible with. The one who makes you feel happy... purely happy. "
"Zora: More important, makes me feel happy, eh? "
"Frasier: Of course, it would be a shame to go through life having to say, 'if I'd only waited...' "
"Zora: Hey, what the hell kind of toast is this, anyway? "
"Frasier: I just want to make sure that my cousin marries the woman that he truly loves the most. "
"Zora: Oh, well, there Cheers, everybody Oh, thank you, Frasier. If I may say a word or two? My son Nikos and I have had our ups and downs, but tonight, at this moment, I can honestly say... what the hell are you doing here? "
"Nikos: Crystal "
"Crystal: Nikos I couldn't let you get married without... without letting you know that I-I... "
"Zora: Nikos, what are you doing? Stop it "
"Niles: How did she get the message? "
"Frasier: Her roommate must have reached her on her car phone "
"Niles: Jugglers have car phones? "
"Zora: Nikos, you are ruining everything You, shoo, shoo, shoo "
"Ann: Nikos Nikos "
"Nikos: I'm sorry, Mary-Ann, but Crystal's the one I'm meant to be with. "
"Ann: I will never forgive you for this "
"Ann: Oh, see how happy you've made my parents? "
"Zora: Frasier, he's lost his mind Talk to him, he listens to you "
"Frasier: You remember my promise, no more meddling "
"Nikos: Excuse me, everyone. This may not exactly be appropriate, but I have a toast too. To the man who reunited me with the woman I plan to spend my life with— "
"Frasier: No, no, inappropriate Toast time is over "
"Nikos: But we want to offer you our thanks— "
"Frasier: No, no, no, no. You know what, everyone, why don't we do some bouzouki dancing? 's' while dancing the way a "
"Zora: Why are they thanking you? "
"Crystal: We owe our happiness to him. "
"Frasier: Why couldn't she have been a mime? "
"Nikos: Once again, he saved me from making a terrible mistake. So, everyone, please lift your glasses to my cousin, Frasier Crane "
"Zora: Oh, I can do better than a glass "
"Frasier: No Aunt Zora, no Out of my way "
"Martin: Well, Walt... "
"Walt: Marty... "
"Martin: Goodbye again. "

"Robert: Now for a difficult one. "
"Niles: Firm, velvety rind, a bit smokey, mmm... applewood, I think. "
"Robert: Oui. "
"Martin: This is what I get for sending you to sleep-away camp in France "
"Robert: Can I help you with anything else, monsieur? "
"Martin: No thanks, this six-dollar can of dog food will be fine. It sure teaches me not to leave my shopping till the last minute again. "
"Niles: Oh, is it Reblochon? "
"Robert: You are good, Dr. Crane. "
"Martin: Yeah, he's a regular cheese whiz "
"Niles: I'll take half a pound of the Reblochon and half a pound of St. André and I know I ask this every week but... is it here? "
"Robert: Is what here? "
"Niles: You know very well what I mean; the imported Swiss prosciutto. "
"Robert: Aaah, the Bidnelfleisch I am sorry, if only you had been here one hour ago... "
"Niles: Damn "
"Robert: You would have seen it arrive. "
"Robert: I have my fun with you. "
"Niles: You do, Robert, you make me long for the days when you barely spoke English. Slice, slice like the wind, I'll take a pound. "
"Martin: Whoa Eighteen dollars a pound This salami's good, but it's not that good. "
"Robert: That saucissons was aged for six months and was cured in a small village at the foot of the Pyrenees at Gilder Brown. It's a steal at that price. "
"Martin: You got that right, pal. "
"Niles: Dad, if you want to wait outside, I'll be through in a minute. "
"Martin: What? I'm fine. Whoa-ho, look at all these different kinds of olive oil. Virgin, extra-virgin. Extra-virgin? How does that work? Well, I guess if you can cure a sausage "
"Robert: Monsieur, I'm so glad you find my foods so amusing. "
"Niles: Oh, Robert, he's only joking, keep on slicing. "
"Martin: Oh, come on now, even you've got to admit this whole store's kinda nutty. "
"Robert: Pardon? "
"Martin: Fourteen dollars for a pound of goat's cheese. God, at that price I ought to be able to get a whole goat "
"Niles: We're slicing. "
"Robert: Perhaps, Monsieur, you would be more comfortable if you just waited outside. "
"Martin: You want me to leave, just come out and say it in plain English. "
"Robert: Fine, leave from my store. "
"Martin: Okay, no problem. Come on Niles, you heard the man, he wants us to 'leave from his store.' "
"Robert: Don't hurry back. "
"Martin: Don't worry, all the money in the world wouldn't get me back in this snob shop. "
"Niles: That man is my father, so obviously I cannot leave here with a bag full of your merchandise. "
"Robert: Home delivery? "
"Niles: No-one treats my father that way... No-one "
"Sharon: About the photo shoot tomorrow, will you be needing make-up? "
"Frasier: Oh, heavens, no "
"Sharon: That's a good choice, because I think that you look very handsome without it. "
"Frasier: Really? Well, I think you look very attractive with make-up. Not that I'm saying you need make-up, it's that if indeed you are wearing make-up, it's so expertly applied that I wouldn't even know you're wearing make-up... I'm sure it looks like I'm wearing some rouge right now. "
"Sharon: I know what you meant, and thank you. Oh, Dr. Crane, I was meaning to ask "
"you: what do you think about two people who work together dating? "
"Frasier: Oh, well, Sharon, I'm asked that question a lot and let me tell you, the stark reality is that that situation is fraught with... "
"Frasier: ... delightful possibilities. "
"Sharon: So, are you free on Friday? "
"Frasier: Er, Friday, yes, Friday it is. After the show? "
"Sharon: Great. "
"Frasier: Great. "
"Sharon: Okay. "
"Frasier: Bye. "
"Clint: Dr. Crane? "
"Frasier: Yes. "
"Clint: Clint Webber. The station just hired me to host the new show on health issues. "
"Frasier: Oh, yes, of course, Dr. Webber. Well, welcome to KACL. "
"Clint: I understand I'm in your debt for recommending my audition tape. "
"Frasier: Oh, not at all, it was very good, very good indeed. Besides, you know, we'd all gotten a bit tired of the last show that was in that timeslot; 'Bert The Backyard Gardener.' A woman in her latest crock gave new meaning to the term, 'Potting Shed' Ah, perfect timing, come Clint. "
"Frasier: Roz Doyle, my producer, this is Dr. Clint Webber, the new host of 'Health Watch.' "
"Roz: Hi. "
"Clint: Hi, great to meet you. "
"Roz: So, er, you're new? "
"Clint: That's right. "
"Roz: And a doctor? "
"Clint: That's right. "
"Clint: Well, I don't want to be late for that station tour. "
"Frasier: Well, again, welcome aboard, Clint. "
"Roz: Oh, my God, could I acted any goofier? "
"Frasier: Not without a set of fake buck-teeth "
"Roz: He's so handsome, I can't work with someone that handsome. No offense. "
"Frasier: Oh, none taken. Granted, when it comes to the looks department, Dr. Webber and I aren't in the same... "
"Roz: Species? "
"Frasier: Well, I was going to say 'league,' but species is so much more insulting "
"Bulldog: This stinks, this is total BS The chicks are all going nuts over this new Webber guy. I'm supposed to be the only sex symbol around here. Wait, look at it, look at it. Come on, take your best shot. "
"Bulldog: Whoa-ho, not you One of those guys. "
"Frasier: Bulldog, you're behaving immaturely even for you. Granted the man's handsome but it's no reason to feel threatened. "
"Gil: I must confess, I didn't notice he was all that handsome. "
"Roz: You didn't notice? You of all people? "
"Gil: Just what are you insinuating? "
"Roz: Well, you know, you're a little... er.... "
"Gil: For your information, I happen to be a happily married man. "
"Frasier: You're... married? "
"Bulldog: To a woman? "
"Gil: Of course to a woman You've all heard me mention Deb. Well, how often have I said, 'I must be running along now, Deb will be waiting.' "
"Roz: We thought Deb was your cat. "
"Gil: She is not a cat She is Mrs. Gilbert Leslie Chesterton, a Sarah Lawrence graduate, and the owner of a very successful auto body repair shop. Honestly, the conclusions people make, just because a man dresses well and knows how to use a pastry bag "
"Frasier: Well, that's the first time I've ever seen a man 'in' himself. "
"TO: "
"Niles: Dad, I can't help noticing Eddie's looking a bit glum. "
"Martin: Yeah, he's mad at me. I gave him a can of that dog food from your fancy gourmet place the other day. "
"Niles: He didn't like it? "
"Martin: No, he loved it, but now he won't eat anything else He even turned his nose up at a kosher pickle and he loves those. And the bad thing is, I called all over Seattle and Frenchie's the only one who carries that stuff. "
"Niles: I don't suppose you'd consider apologizing? "
"Martin: Forget it, I'm never setting foot in that store again. "
"Niles: If things get worse, there is a technique of sleep-feeding I know. It involves an eye-dropper and a high fructose protein shake. "
"Martin: Well, I don't know about that. "
"Niles: Well, it worked on Maris. "
"Niles: Frasier, are you aware? "
"Frasier: Yes, I'm aware. We were taking publicity photos today, I had an allergic reaction to the make-up I was wearing. I wasn't planning on wearing any make-up at all but there's this handsome new employee at the station, everybody's feeling incredibly insecure about their looks. They were all slapping their make-up on, so I too gave in to vanity. [Clint enters and goes to the counter] And, like Icarus flying too close to the sun I had to pay the price. "
"Martin: Wow "
"Frasier: Thank you, Dad, I don't like to go with mythology too often, but that was spot-on... "
"Martin: No, I mean that guy, he's so handsome. "
"Roz: It's him, it's him, Dr. Webber. "
"Frasier: All right, Roz "
"Niles: Well, he is striking. "
"Roz: Frasier's just jealous. "
"Frasier: Oh, I am not jealous. Yes, the man is handsome, but I'm sure there are a number of areas in which I am his superior. You know, let's not forget that good looks can be a mixed blessing. People just roll out the red carpet for you but that robs you of any incentive to develop other qualities. After a while you're left an aging narcissist bent at the water's edge, realizing those lines in the pond aren't ripples, they're wrinkles. "
"Martin: Amazing. "
"Frasier: Thank you, dad, I rather like that one myself. "
"Martin: That guy could be a movie star "
"Frasier: All right, Roz, don't we have some work... [notices free table] over there? "
"Niles: Oh, no, no, take this table, I have a session anyway. "
"Martin: Yeah, I gotta go too. Like Zeus riding his thunderbolt to Mount... "
"Frasier: Very amusing Dad, off you go. "
"Clint: Dr. Crane. "
"Frasier: Oh, Dr. Webber. You remember Roz Doyle, of course. "
"Clint: Yes, hello. "
"Frasier: Who could forget that infectious laugh? "
"Clint: Speaking of which, has anyone had a look at that rash? "
"Frasier: Oh, yes, everybody. "
"Clint: So, mind if I join you? "
"Frasier: Well, actually we were... "
"Roz: We were hoping you would. "
"Frasier: So, Clint, I see that you're a squash player. You know, if you're up for a game some day, I used to play a bit back in Harvard. "
"Clint: Well, I'd love to. Harvard? Wow I was dying to go to Harvard. "
"Frasier: Well, I'm sure the school you went to was just as good. "
"Clint: I went to Oxford. "
"Frasier: Oh, well, even better. So, did you go to medical school there as well? "
"Clint: Yes, but I took a year off first to get my Master's in French history. "
"Frasier: Ah? "
"Clint: Just wanted to do something fun. "
"Frasier: Mmmm. "
"Roz: Does that mean you speak French? "
"Clint: Certainement, pois je conte belle fais. "
"Frasier: Well, I too understand the importance in taking some time off before beginning medical school. I spent that summer in Milan studying the history of opera. In fact, I had the good fortune to make an acquaintance and become friends with a then-little-known young tenor by the name of Carreras. "
"Clint: Jose Carreras? "
"Frasier: Forgive the name dropping. "
"Clint: He's my godfather. "
"Frasier: You're joking "
"Clint: No, I'll call him tonight, he'll be delighted to hear I'm working with you. "
"Frasier: I'll be interested to see if he remembers the game we used to play where we pretended not to remember one another. "
"Clint: You know, Frasier, that rash is starting to concern me. Maybe I'll just pop out to the car and get my medical gear. "
"Frasier: There's really no need. "
"Frasier: Okay, maybe we can work now while he's gone. [Roz starts fanning herself] Oh, Roz, for heaven's sake. You're behaving like a starry eyed Bobby Socks-er. Yes, the man is good looking, it's not like he can stop traffic "
"Frasier: There's a blind corner out there, we don't know that was him "
"Roz: How was your squash game? "
"Frasier: Oh, well, Dr. Webber neglected to mention that he was squash champion back in college. "
"Roz: I'm sorry, Frasier. "
"Frasier: Oh, no, not at all. It was a lovely morning, Clint was gracious enough to treat me to breakfast. Course, once we arrived at 'Le Renée,' the chef had just cut himself. Clint not only treated the wound but set about to making us a flawless egg-white and truffle omelet. "
"Clint: I put myself through med school as a sous-chef at 'Le Cirque.' "
"Roz: Sometimes I just want to pinch you to make sure you're real. "
"Frasier: He's real. "
"Clint: I'm just going to get a glass of water, I'll be right back. "
"Roz: But you're about to start the show. "
"Frasier: Yes, I know, Roz, I thought it would be a good idea to have Clint on, introduce him to my listeners, give his show a leg up. "
"Roz: All right, you're plugging Clint? I'm sorry, I'm having a lot of trouble believing this buddy-buddy attitude. "
"Frasier: Roz, try as you may to insinuate that I have some seething jealousy to this man, the fact is, I like Clint. Why else would I be giving a party in his honour this evening? "
"Roz: Okay. You're on in ten seconds. "
"Frasier: Yes, right up. Let's just slip on our headphones, and follow my lead, okay? Good afternoon, Seattle, this is Dr. Frasier Crane. Before we start our regular program, I'd like to take this opportunity to introduce you to Dr. Clint Webber. Clint, if you're anything like I am, you'll spend your first week trying to figure out what all these buttons do. "
"Clint: Actually, in college I ran the radio station. "
"Frasier: Ah, well, things may have gotten a bit more sophisticated since then. For instance we have here a cough button. "
"Clint: If I'm not mistaken that's the echo button. "
"Frasier: Of course it is. All my listeners are familiar with my now-trademark 'echoing cough' Well, let's go to the lines, take our first call, show Dr. Webber the ropes, shall we? Go ahead, you're on the air. "
"Marie: Oh, hi, hi, Dr. Crane, it's Marie. "
"Frasier: Oh, hello, Marie, I'm listening. "
"Marie: I, I've been having a hard time getting out of bed every morning and when I finally do I'm irritable for hours. "
"Frasier: Really? Well, Marie, the desire to stay in bed is very similar to the desire to regress to the womb. Some unconscious fear is driving you to a place of safety. Now, in order to resolve this problem you're going to have to examine your life and discover just what it is you're retreating from. It's hard but very necessary work, I suggest that it maybe time to try some therapy. "
"Marie: Wow "
"Clint: You are good, Dr. Crane. The first thing that came to my head was that she might be a little hypoglycemic, I'd have suggested some protein in the morning. "
"Marie: Oh, wait a minute. Last Thursday I had eggs for breakfast and I felt great all day. "
"Clint: Well, maybe that's it, then. "
"Marie: Oh, what a relief You know, you scared the life out of me, Dr. Crane. "
"Frasier: Yes, well, thank you, Marie. But I think it's time to say goodbye to Dr. Webber now and we'll be back right after these messages. "
"Clint: Thanks, Frasier, that was fun. "
"Frasier: Yes, it was, wasn't it? "
"Clint: I hope I didn't say anything out of line. "
"Frasier: Oh, no, no, not at all, I always enjoy learning something new. Well, I'll see you tonight, don't be late. "
"Clint: I'm always punctual. "
"Frasier: Of course you are "
"Frasier: I hate him. "
"TO: "
"Martin: Oh, he's not even here. "
"Daphne: Your luck's out. "
"Martin: Yes, I'll just take a case of that dog food, please. "
"Assistant: Will that be all? "
"Martin: Yeah, that's it and I'm in a bit of a hurry. "
"Daphne: Look here, Nickerson's Lemon Biscuits. God, these bring back memories. I just love them. Do you carry the Raspberry ones as well? "
"Assistant: I'm not sure. "
"Martin: Could you come back for those? "
"Assistant: Robert? "
"Martin: Oh, God. "
"Robert: Well, look who's come back. "
"Martin: Look, why don't you just let me pay for this and get out of here? What do I owe you? "
"Robert: I think we both know what you owe me. "
"Martin: All right. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have made fun of your store. You gonna let me off the hook or not? "
"Robert: All right, I'll sell it to you. I never like to lose a customer. "
"Martin: Well, great. You know, while I'm here I might as well take a few cases. "
"Robert: We have several new varieties in if you'd care to take a look. "
"Martin: Oh, sure. "
"Robert: Please, show the man. "
"Daphne: Oh, I think these biscuits are mis-marked. "
"Robert: No, that's correct. "
"Daphne: $14.95 for a package this small? "
"Robert: I see we have another member of the price club "
"Daphne: Hey, there's no need for that attitude. Back home I can get these for 80 pence "
"Robert: Well, I do have to fly these over. "
"Daphne: What did you do? Buy them a seat on the Concorde? "
"Robert: Madame, if you cannot afford them, simply put them back. "
"Daphne: I can bloody well afford them, I just don't like being gouged, this is robbery "
"Robert: Robber No-one calls me a robber "
"Assistant: Robert? "
"Robert: Not now On your way out you will see a sign on the door saying 'Please come again.' Disregard it "
"Daphne: I'd be happy to. You know, Mr. Crane was right about you. You're nothing but an arrogant, swindling little cheese- monger. "
"Martin: This is great I'll take a case of each. "
"Robert: You'll take a case of nothing "
"Martin: What happened now? "
"Daphne: We don't need him or his food "
"Martin: Yes, we do, he's got tarragon flavor now "
"Daphne: Come on "
"Martin: But Daph, what about Eddie? "
"Daphne: Oh, he'll eat when he gets hungry. For heaven's sakes, he drinks out of the toilet "
"TO: "
"Clint: So, George S. Kaufmann so dislikes what the actor is doing, he sends the poor fellow a telegram reading, 'I'm watching your performance from the rear of the house, wish you were here.' Sorry to jump in there, Frasier, but I believe that's the story you started. "
"Frasier: Thanks for helping out. "
"Bulldog: Hey, Doc, I gotta hand it to you, great way to welcome the new guy. "
"Frasier: Oh, well, really? I'm surprised you're even here at the party. I didn't think you cared much for Clint. "
"Bulldog: Nah, I'm over that. I figured, he can't have every chick. So if we pal around, I bag the leftovers. "
"Frasier: Ah, the regular busboy romance. Excuse me. [opens door to Niles] Niles. "
"Niles: How's it going? "
"Frasier: Well, let me see, what have you missed? Clint told us about how he learned to fly a plane, and then he recited a sonnet and, oh yes, he fixed my ice machine and he invented a new drink; the 'Pink Webber' He's got Daphne drawing a bath right now, in case the party starts to lag, he invited to walk on water, liven things up a bit. "
"Niles: Well, don't let it make you crazy, Frasier. At some point we all run into someone who's our superior. "
"Frasier: It's just that I've never dealt with this sort of thing before. "
"Niles: Never? "
"Frasier: I can see how that might be baffling to you, as my younger brother, you dealt with this thing all your life. "
"Niles: Yes, well, at least we know he won't out shine you in the egomania department "
"Frasier: You're right, I'm being a bit silly about this thing, I suppose. I just wish I could one flaw, one area where I'm his superior. "
"Niles: Well, I'm sure you will.... Although it won't be in the drink department, this is heaven in a glass "
"Clint: Oh, Frasier, I was just admiring this chess board, it's beautiful. "
"Frasier: Thank you. Do you play? "
"Clint: No, I've read a book or two. Are you in the middle of a match? "
"Frasier: Well, yes, as a matter of fact, I'm playing by mail with a Russian grand master. It's quite challenging. "
"Clint: Well, congratulations. With your cunning use of the Zekreptsky attack, you're only four moves away from certain victory "
"Frasier: My God, you're right. And actually I'd be happy to hear that, except I'm playing black, well... wasn't that a fun eight months "
"Frasier: Hello, Sharon. Sorry we haven't had a chance to speak much. "
"Sharon: Oh, I know but I'm really looking forward to our date on Friday. "
"Frasier: Yes, so am I, and you look absolutely beautiful - or should I say... "
"Frasier: Oh Boy, what's so funny? "
"Sharon: Well, you just told me 'I was as a lovely as a chicken beak.' "
"Frasier: Oh, really? "
"Clint: Who's as lovely as a chicken beak? "
"Sharon: You speak Mandarin? "
"Clint: Frasier, I just wanted to thank you for this party. "
"Frasier: Oh, don't mention it. "
"Clint: It's been a perfect evening; The hors d'oeuvres, the company, the music. Oh, I love this song. "
"Frasier: Enjoy. "
"Clint: 'Isn't it romantic? Music in the night... "
"Clint: Oh, I'm sorry, I was singing too loud. "
"Frasier: No, no, not at all. I can't tell you how much I'm enjoying hearing it. "
"Clint: Careful, it doesn't take much coaxing to get me to perform. "
"Frasier: Really? "
"Clint: Oh, yes, get a glass of wine in me, before you know it, I'm serenading the entire room. "
"Frasier: Really? "
"Clint: Oh, I'm afraid I have a bit of the old ham in me. Would it be presumptuous to sing in front of your guests? "
"Frasier: Well, I think we could persuade the piano player to play it again. "
"Frasier: Niles, Niles, I've done it. I have found his Achilles Heel "
"Niles: Ah, who's? "
"Frasier: Clint's Oh, I just heard him singing, the man is completely tone deaf. He's about to launch into a rendition of 'Isn't It Romantic' that will simply peel the enamel from your teeth "
"Niles: Are you sure you want to let him do that? "
"Frasier: What do you mean? "
"Niles: Well, you have your victory, you're a wonderful singer. Isn't it enough to know that? Do you really need to see him humiliate himself? "
"Frasier: Yes. "
"Niles: Now, Frasier... "
"Frasier: No, no, no, I know, you're right. I guess I am a bigger man than that. "
"Daphne: Hey, Dr. Crane, your friend, Clint, he's quite a charmer. "
"Frasier: Yes, he is, isn't he? "
"Daphne: Yeah, do you suppose he's single? I was just getting up the nerve to give him my phone number. "
"Clint: Excuse me, everyone. I just want to thank you all for this warm welcome to KACL and as a token of my gratitude, I'd like to share this song with you. "
"Frasier: Clint, there's been a little change of plan... "
"Niles: Yes I'm going to be your accompanist now "
"Clint: 'Isn't it romantic? Music in the night, A dream that can't be heard... Isn't it romantic?....... "
"reason: "
"Frasier: Please, everybody... nobody's perfect. "

"Frasier: What's going on, anyway? My God, I've got an appointment in twenty minutes. "
"Bulldog: Ah, some weenie made a big stink so they've gotta clean the milk steamer every time they use it. "
"Frasier: Oh. "
"Bulldog: Is was you, wasn't it? "
"Frasier: Well, if requesting basic sanitary procedures makes me a weenie, then a weenie be I. "
"Roz: Hi, guys. "
"Bulldog: Hey, Roz. "
"Roz: Oh, God, Frasier, what stupid suggestion did you make this time? "
"Frasier: Nice to see you, too, Roz. "
"Roz: Sorry. I just spent two hours trying on jumbo formal wear for the SeaBea awards. "
"Roz: The best part was when the size two sales girl said I could use this again after my pregnancy. "
"Frasier: Well, perhaps you could... cut off the bow, remove the sleeves, and, uh... "
"Bulldog: Stick a pole in it and go camping. "
"Roz: You know, if I'm gonna stick a pole some place.... "
"Frasier: Children "
"Bulldog: Coffee to go. Black. "
"Frasier: I, for one, am looking forward to the SeaBeas. "
"Bulldog: Why? You're not gonna win. They never give it to the emcee Now me? I'm a lock. "
"Frasier: Well, you're awfully cocky. "
"Bulldog: Hey, if knowing I'm the best thing on the air makes me cocky, then cocky be I. "
"Frasier: Ah. "
"Bulldog: See? You're not the only one who can talk classy. "
"Roz: How is that talking like Lassie? "
"Frasier: Let's just move on, shall we? "
"Frasier: Roz That man, he's got a gun "
"Bulldog: He's got a gun "
"Frasier: Roz, are you all right? "
"Roz: Yeah, uh.... "
"Roz: Bulldog, I can't believe you did that You saved me "
"Bulldog: Uh, I just did what anyone would've done. "
": You were so brave "
": You're a hero "
"Bulldog: Hey, close enough. "
"Niles: Excuse me, would you hold that, please? "
"Frasier: Niles "
"Niles: Frasier, I was just on my way up to see you "
"Frasier: Niles, what have we determined about your success with... impulse purchases? "
"Niles: Really? The salesman thought I could pull it off. "
"Frasier: My suggestion exactly. "
"Niles: Fine. Fine. Frasier, ask me if I have news. "
"Frasier: Actually, I've got some news of my own. In the cafe today - Oh, for God's sake. Niles, do you have news? "
"Niles: Indeed I do. First of all, congratulations on your SeaBea nomination. "
"Frasier: Thank you. "
"Niles: Now, congratulate me on mine "
"Frasier: What are you talking about? "
"Niles: Well, if you'd bothered to look past your own name on the first page, you'd have found mine right after it on page... fifteen. "
"Frasier: 'Best Performance By a Guest on an Information Show.' "
"Niles: Yes, it's for that spot I did on KJSB when I discussed the psychological effects of long-term inclement weather. "
"Frasier: Ah, yes, yes, yes.... Thirty minutes of psychobabble all reducible to one "
"phrase: 'Rain, rain, go away.' "
"Niles: I'm hardly surprised you feel the need to belittle my nomination. In your mind, you're the success, the famous one. I'm just invisible. That's not the way the rest of the world sees me. "
"Martin: Oh, Frasier, boy, am I glad to see you "
"Frasier: Oh, thanks, guys, thank you. "
"Daphne: Doctor Crane, thank goodness you're home "
"Niles: I'm also here "
"Daphne: We heard what happened at the café. "
"Frasier: Yes, Niles, as I have tried to tell you, there was an attempted armed robbery today at the café. "
"Niles: Good heavens Was anyone hurt? "
"Frasier: No, no, no, thank goodness. It all diffused rather quickly. Tempest in a tea pot, really. [rubs Daphne's shoulders as he walks back to hang up his coat] Thank you. "
"Niles: Well, that's a relief On a more pleasant topic, this afternoon, I found out- "
"Frasier: Oh, Niles, hold on a second. How did you two hear about it? "
"Daphne: On the news "
"Martin: Boy, Bulldog really saved the day "
"Frasier: They said that on the news? "
"Martin: Oh, yeah, how he swept Roz out of the way and then threw his hot coffee on the gunman "
"Frasier: That's not how it happened at all Why would he say such a thing? "
"Niles: Well, it was drizzling today, and people act strangely when it rains, as I pointed out in my SeaBea-nominated- "
"Frasier: Shut up, Niles. "
"Martin: Well, then what did happen? "
"TO: the scene in the café. It plays out step by step as "
"Frasier: Well, we were all standing at the counter, when I noticed a man with a gun. I warned Roz. Bulldog saw a different man reaching for his wallet, and thought he was the gunman. That's when he grabbed Roz and held her in front of him as a human shield But as he did that, he accidentally knocked his coffee onto the actual gunman, burning his hand, causing him to drop his weapon and run out "
"TO: int Elliot Bay Towers. "
"Daphne: And no one else saw that happen? "
"Frasier: Well, apparently not. "
"Martin: Wow, I can't believe Bulldog'd use Roz like that "
"Niles: Why didn't you say anything? "
"Frasier: Well, I was just so relieved everyone was all right at first I suppose it did irk me when everyone was praising him, and the owner of the cafe promised him a lifetime supply of muffins Well, I never thought it'd go this far. I never thought I'd hear it on the news [walks over to pour himself a sherry] "
"Daphne: I wonder how much that would be, a lifetime supply of muffins? "
"Frasier: I'm certainly not going to let Bulldog get away with this "
"Daphne: I don't think I've ever seen Bulldog eat a muffin. A lifetime supply would be wasted on him "
"Frasier: I'm going to tell him I saw exactly what happened "
"Daphne: Now me, I could eat a muffin a day, some days even two knowing they'd be free. So that'd be... ten a week, fifty-two weeks a year, for at least another... forty years, which works out to.... Twenty thousand muffins My life suddenly seems long, measured in muffins. "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Well, that's all the time we have for today. Good afternoon, Seattle, and good mental health. Roz, did you see Bulldog come in? "
"Roz: No, I haven't. I've been looking for him myself. "
"Roz: Stop that, they're for him "
"Frasier: Do you really think he had anything to do with... "
"Roz: There he is "
"Bulldog: Hey, hey, hey Nothing new here. I take my pants off one leg at a time, just like everybody else. You can vouch for that, can't you, Myrna? "
"Roz: Hey, Bulldog, I made these cookies for you. "
"Bulldog: Wow, I already had a bunch of muffins, but... there's always room for a cookie. Um, where's the milk? "
"Roz: Ooh, coming right up "
"Frasier: Hello, Bulldog. "
"Bulldog: Hey, doc This hero stuff is the best Hey, last night, sisters. At one point, I was a hero sandwich "
"Frasier: Just drop it. I saw what you did yesterday. "
"Bulldog: Yeah, I saved your butt. "
"Frasier: Saved my butt, my ass You pulled Roz in front of you to protect yourself Everything else that happened was simply by accident. "
"Bulldog: THAT STINKS THAT'S TOTAL BS I'm a hero I'm a brave, brave man Aw, Jeez, you're not gonna tell, are you? "
"Frasier: Give me one good reason why I shouldn't. "
"Bulldog: You like muffins? "
"Frasier: You know what, I was determined to expose you, but it suddenly occurs to me I don't have to. You'll do it yourself. And you know why? Because a guilty conscience needs no accuser. "
"Bulldog: That means you won't tell? "
"Frasier: Once again, I don't have to, because a guilty conscience sleeps in thunder "
"Frasier: It means I won't tell. "
"Producer: Twenty seconds, Bulldog. "
"Frasier: You know, actually I'll be fascinated as a psychiatrist to watch this little experiment. I know that deep down you feel bad about what you've done. And you'll feel worse every time you capitalize on it. How long before your conscience finally overwhelms you? "
"Producer: You're on. "
"Bulldog: Hey, sports fans This is Bob Bulldog Briscoe, and you're in the doghouse Let's go to the phones "
"Roz: Hey, everybody, this is Roz Doyle, and I have some very exciting news Each year, at the SeaBea Awards, one radio personality receives the Harold Hirschauer Man of the Year Award... "
"Roz: ...and this year, our winner is our very own Bulldog Briscoe, who was chosen for his heroism Congratulations, Bulldog "
"Frasier: Well, what do you say to that, hero? "
"Bulldog: Well, this is incredible. I.. I uh really feel honored.... "
"Bulldog: But I gotta clear something up. "
"Bulldog: Yesterday, at the cafe, this young lady kept coming up to me saying, 'You're my hero. How can I ever thank you?' Well, I've got a confession to make. I lost your number, but if you call in, baby, I've got an answer for you "
"Niles: Okay, I'm ready. Go ahead, Daphne. "
"Daphne: And the SeaBea goes to... Doctor Niles Crane "
"Niles: Oh Oh "
"Daphne: Congratulations "
"Niles: Thank you You know, to be accurate, it's traditional for the presenter to kiss and embrace the winner. "
"Daphne: But won't your brother be the presenter? "
"Niles: Well, we can't know that for certain. "
"Daphne: "
"Daphne: Hello, Doctor Crane We're just practicing for Saturday night. Best-case scenario. "
"Frasier: Obviously. "
"Martin: Hey, Daph, your pie's done. "
"Daphne: Oh, thanks. Will you be joining us for coffee and dessert? "
"Frasier: Oh, no thank you, Daphne. I'm not very hungry. "
"Niles: Where've you been? "
"Frasier: Oh, I've been driving around, thinking. I can't seem to get this Bulldog thing off my mind. "
"Martin: Well, don't worry about it. We all get obsessed sometimes. The important thing is to drop it before you start yakking on and on to someone who doesn't give a rat's ass. "
"Frasier: Is that your roundabout way of saying you don't want to discuss it? "
"Martin: You wanna take the direct route? "
"Niles: Why do you care so much about Bulldog? "
"Frasier: Well, it's not really Bulldog, so much. It's just that I believe that conscience, more than customs and laws, is what prevents people from doing wrong. To contemplate the idea of an otherwise sane man with no conscience... It just shakes my entire world view. "
"Daphne: Well, in our family, we certainly knew the meaning of conscience. That's what my dad called his wooden paddle. "
"Niles: Oh, how awful for you "
"Daphne: Oh, for my brothers, yes. But I knew he'd never use it on me, as long as I was always good. As long as I was always polite. [looks disturbed] As long as I always had a smile on my face no matter how I felt inside [slams down the silverware in front of them] As long as I was always ready to wait on all the men, hand and foot, day and night, year in, year out "
"Daphne: More coffee, anyone? "
"Niles: No, no, no, you just have a seat. [gestures for her to sit at the table, lifts coffee pot, begins to pour] You... just... here, I'll... for you. "
"Frasier: Maybe I'm blowing this thing out of proportion. I just can't understand how Bulldog can accept all those accolades and not be tormented by it. "
"Daphne: Well, maybe he is. "
"Niles: Yes, for all you know, he's at home right now, pacing the floor, unable to sleep. "
"Frasier: But we'll never know for sure, now, will we? Well, enough about this. You know, I think I'm off to bed. Goodnight all. "
"Daphne: Goodnight "
"Martin: Goodnight, son. You know, I'm really proud of Fras. Used to be he'd get a bee in his bonnet, and he'd never get it out. "
"Daphne: Yes, I thought we'd be hearing about this one for weeks. "
"Niles: Well, the old Frasier'd be up with this all night. "
"Martin: Exactly Wouldn't be able to sleep until he went over to Bulldog's to make sure he wasn't sleeping. "
"Daphne: I should have told him to pick up some more milk. "
"TO: "
"Bulldog: What're you doing here? "
"Frasier: I want to talk to you. "
"Bulldog: Ugh. This isn't a good time. I got company. "
"Frasier: You have done something horrible, and selfish. And I need to know that you feel bad about it. "
"Bulldog: What, you've been looking through the keyhole? "
"Frasier: I'm talking about what happened with Roz "
"Bulldog: Aw, not this again. "
": "
": Bulldog, I'm lonely. "
"Bulldog: Talk to your sister for a sec, I'll be right there. "
"Bulldog: Ooh, man, I gotta go. See ya mañana. "
"Frasier: Bulldog "
"Bulldog: Would you stop that? "
"Frasier: I am not leaving until I know that you feel some remorse for what you've done. "
"Bulldog: Wow, this is really bugging you, isn't it? "
"Frasier: Yes "
"Bulldog: Well. Okay. All right, all right. The truth? The truth is I feel bad. I feel real bad. [pretends to cry] "
"Frasier: You feel NOTHING "
"Bulldog: I'm sorry, doc These little things just don't get to me "
"Frasier: The little thing in question is using a pregnant woman as a human shield Have you no conscience? "
"Bulldog: Well, maybe I don't. "
"Frasier: I refuse to believe that "
"Bulldog: Well, maybe it was something I was born without... like, oh, like my cousin. He was born without a big toe on each foot. I used to sneak up on him and tip him over. I didn't feel bad about that, either. See ya, doc. "
"Frasier: No No No, you don't I know you've got a conscience. It must be buried deep inside there. I will find a way to get it out of you "
"Bulldog: Yeah, you do that, doc. "
"Frasier: Oh, you mark my words. I don't know how yet, but come Saturday night you will be so consumed with guilt you will not be able to accept that Man of the Year Award [stalks off] "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Daphne "
"Frasier: Oh, you're gorgeous. "
"Daphne: Oh, thank you. "
"Frasier: Dad, not bad, either "
"Martin: Thanks, although I guess any guy looks good in a monkey suit. "
"Daphne: On the drive over I started musing about why they call it a monkey suit. I had quite a few theories on that one. "
"Martin: Can I get a ride home with you? "
"Frasier: Of course. "
"Daphne: Oh, Roz, is everything all right? "
"Roz: Yeah, I'm fine, it's just that my hair is huge and this dress is a joke. "
"Frasier: No, nonsense, Roz, you look divine. "
"Roz: No, I look LIKE Divine. I gotta go sit down. [moves toward table, then looks at herself] Oh, my God. Look at the way the lights are shining on the sequins on this dress I'm a disco ball "
"Frasier: Well, it certainly promises to be quite a night. "
"Martin: Yeah You know, I'm glad to see you're enjoying yourself. I wasn't sure that you would, what with Bulldog getting that award and everything. "
"Frasier: Well, Dad, I wouldn't be surprised if Bulldog actually declines that award. "
"Martin: Why would he? "
"Frasier: Well, I've arranged a few surprises to prick his conscience, until, like Hamlet's stepfather, he totters from the banquet, ghostly pale and gibbering with guilt "
"Martin: Can I get a ride home with you? "
"Frasier: Niles. "
"Niles: Hello, all. Daphne, you look stunning. "
"Daphne: Oh, thanks, you look very smart. "
"Niles: Thank you. Of course, I guess it's hard not to look elegant in evening wear. "
"Niles: Hard but not impossible. "
"Frasier: No. Well, shall we take our seats? "
"Niles: Yes Although if Dame Rumor is correct, I won't be sitting long Now are we all at table... 105? "
"Daphne: We're at table four. "
"Niles: Excuse me. Where's this table? "
"Waitress: One hundred five... that's the technical awards. Just go down to the basement, cross through the kitchen to the hall, and ask for the Napoleon Room. "
"Niles: Oh, the Napoleon Room, that sounds charming. "
"Waitress: We call it that because the ceilings are so low. "
"Daphne: What a shame. Now you won't get to see your brother host or hear all the little jokes he's written.... "
"Niles: Thank you, Daphne, I needed some cheering up. "
"Frasier: Oh, Bulldog. "
"Bulldog: Aw, Jeez, let's go this way. "
"Frasier: Oh, no, there's no reason to avoid me, Bulldog. I have no intention of ruining your evening. In fact, I've gone to great lengths to make it memorable. "
"Bulldog: Eh, you been sleeping okay, doc? You look a little tired. "
"Frasier: Oh, don't you worry about me, I'll sleep fine tonight The sleep of the just "
"Bulldog: Me, too. The sleep of the just boinked. "
"DISSOLVE: Time passes. Frasier is presenting. "
"Frasier: And the nominees "
"are: 'Consumer Forum,' Wendy Hashiro, talent, Mike Friedman, producer ; 'The Doctor Frasier Crane Show,' Dr. Frasier Crane, talent, Roz Doyle, producer ; and 'Bob and Nipsy's Morning Laugh Factory,' Bob and Nipsy, talent, Lunatic Larry, producer . And the SeaBea goes to... Well, well. “Bob and Nipsy's Morning Laugh Factory” Bob and Nipsy couldn't make it tonight, so I accept this award on their behalf. That brings us to our final category, but rather than compete with the coffee service, let's take a short break, and we'll be right back with... the Man of the Year Award "
"Martin: Sorry you didn't win. "
"Frasier: Oh, God, that's all right, Dad I'm only concerned about one award tonight. That's the next one "
"Daphne: Hey, Doctor Crane How did it go? "
"Niles: I lost "
"Martin: Sorry you didn't win. God, I've been saying that a lot tonight. "
"Niles: Oh, look, wine. They didn't serve alcohol at the technical awards, as I informed so many of the guests who mistook me for their waiter. You see, I was the only nominee dressed in black tie, except for the one man in front wearing a tuxedo tee-shirt. "
"Frasier: I'm sorry, Niles. "
"Niles: At least I didn't come home empty-handed. We each received one of these handsome certificates , which were given out after we'd folded our tables and stacked our chairs. "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen. Now the time has come to present the Harold Hirschauer Man of the Year Award. [Susan places award on table] Thank you, Susan. As you all know, this award is presented every year to the radio personality who brings honor to our medium. This year, that person is Bob 'Bulldog' Briscoe C'mon up here, Bulldog "
"Bulldog: Wow, what a night, huh? "
"Frasier: Well, Bob, the night is just beginning for you. Could we please lower the house lights? "
"Bulldog: What's going on? "
"Frasier: Just a few surprise guests that I've invited to help you celebrate this evening [pats him] People from your past that've helped make you the man you are today. Do you recognize... this voice? "
"Rourke: Bobby Briscoe, you've made us all proud. "
"Bulldog: Oh my gosh, is that- "
"Frasier: Yes, it's Father O'Rourke, your boyhood priest and childhood confessor And who's that next to him? "
"McCloud: Bobby Briscoe, sit down in your chair "
"Frasier: That's right, it's Mrs. McCloud, your second-grade teacher The woman who taught you that honesty is the best policy And who's that next to her? "
"Nugent: Drop and give me fifty, Bulldog. "
"Bulldog: Oh, my gosh, Coach Nugents "
"Frasier: It's Coach Nugent, from your peewee football days, the man who taught you that it doesn't matter whether you win or lose but that you play the game fair "
"Bulldog: You're wasting your time. "
"Frasier: And who's that next to him? Yes It's the president... of your fan club Little Joey Katona, whose only dream is to grow up and be just like you [applause, Joey, grinning, squeaks Bulldog-esque horn] But we're not through yet Could we please bring the house lights up again? "
"Frasier: We've saved the best for last. It's the woman that gave everything to you... "
"Bulldog: Well, you'll have to narrow that one down "
"Frasier: The night would not be complete without the woman who taught you right from wrong.... It's your mother, Bernice Briscoe [backs away from Bulldog, clapping with rest of audience] "
"Bulldog: Mom "
"Bernice: I am so proud of you, Bobby "
"Bulldog: Oh, Ma "
"Frasier: Now let's turn the microphone over to our guest of honor this evening. I'm sure we're all anxious to see [very tense with anticipation] what the hero has to say "
"Bulldog: I didn't think I'd be accepting this in front of all you guys. I wrote up this little speech. I can't say this stuff now. What I've got to say is simple.... [long pause, Frasier smiles; finally, Bulldog grabs SeaBea] This is totally awesome Thank you everybody "
"Frasier: This can't be happening "
"Martin: Let it go. "
"Frasier: I can't The man is a coward and he's being rewarded "
"Martin: Guess I'm never gonna hear the end of this, now, am I? "
"Frasier: No I'm sorry, Dad, but I won't- "
"Martin: All right, all right, wait just a minute. Hey, Bulldog, there's a guy right there with a gun "
"Bulldog: There's a gun "
"Martin: Sorry, my mistake. "
"Waitress: He used his own mother to protect himself "
"Date: Eeeeew "
"Roz: Isn't that what you did to me? "
"Bulldog: No I just, uh.... no, no "
"Bernice: What is the matter with you? [starts hitting him in the head] "
"Rourke: You don't deserve that award "
"Frasier: Thanks, Dad. "
"Martin: Hey, I'm no hero, I just wanted you to shut up. "

"Niles: Frasier, Roz Uh, I'd join you, but there's not a chair— "
"Roz: Oh, actually I was just leaving. You can have mine. "
"Roz: Niles Every time I give you my chair, you wipe it off first. It's just insulting "
"Niles: For your information, I was reaching for my cell phone. "
"Roz: Oh. I'm sorry, Niles. I stepped out of line. See you later, Frasier. "
"Frasier: Bye-bye, Roz. "
"Waiter: Café Nervosa. "
"Niles: Yes, this is Dr. Crane at Table Seven. Could you send someone over to dust off my chair? "
"Frasier: Oh, for God's sake I'll do it "
"Frasier: That's the most ridiculous thing I've seen in my entire life Stop it, just sit down "
"Niles: May I have one of those, please? So, I understand you had a full dance card this weekend? "
"Frasier: Yes, indeed. I met a lovely young artist at the gallery opening on Saturday. We went out for coffee afterwards, and our date lasted until, well... the cows didn't actually come home, but I did hear mooing on the front porch "
"Niles: Wait, I'm drawing a blank. The only woman I remember you chatting with at the gallery was the one in the Birkenstocks who went on and on about her driftwood collages. "
"Frasier: Yes, that's Caitlin. "
"Niles: Oh "
"Frasier: Well, obviously we seem different on the surface. But once you get to know her, trust me, she is really a breath of fresh air. God, I haven't felt this excited about a relationship in ages "
"Niles: Well, that's wonderful, Frasier [the waiter brings his coffee] Thank you. So, is she from around here? "
"Frasier: Oh, it didn't come up. "
"Niles: Oh, I see. Well, uh, where'd she go to school? "
"Frasier: She didn't mention it. "
"Niles: Probably art school. "
"Frasier: Well, yes. "
"Niles: Being an artist, I'm sure she is enthusiastic about the finer things — literature, music... "
"Frasier: Uh, I don't know, we never got around to that. "
"Niles: You know what, I think I'm putting you on the spot here. Let's just leave it at congratulations on your new... relationship. "
"Frasier: What are you implying? "
"Niles: Oh, I think we both know what kind of relationship we're talking about. "
"Frasier: Would you stop saying the word 'relationship' that way? — relationship. "
"Niles: I'm not condemning you for your little... fling— "
"Frasier: Oh, for God's sake. "
"Niles: Just don't try to pass it off as something deeper than it is. The only thing you two have in common is the faint impression of the word 'Sealy' on your backsides. "
"Frasier: Listen, Niles, I would never stay in a relationship if I didn't think there was some real future in it. "
"Niles: In other words, if you were to realize that the two of you had nothing in common beyond the physical, you'd break it off? "
"Frasier: Yes, absolutely In a heartbeat It's a principle of mine — you know, this topic comes up all the time on my show. What do I always say? "
"Niles: Um... "
"Frasier: Surely you must listen occasionally "
"Niles: Of course I listen occasionally. It's just I'm usually busy between eleven and one. "
"Frasier: My show is on from two to five. "
"Martin: I can't wait to see the look on his face. "
"Daphne: Me, too. He doesn't have a clue. "
"Martin: Good. All set. "
"singing: "
"Daphne: Happy birthday to you... "
"Frasier: Oh, dear God. "
"Daphne: Happy birthday, Dear Eddie, Happy birthday to you "
"Martin: OK, let's do it together. "
"Martin: Good boy Great That was terrific "
"Daphne: I wonder if he made a wish? "
"Frasier: I know I did. "
"Frasier: Niles "
"Niles: Hello, Frasier. Dad, Daphne, step lively We don't want to miss the previews. "
"Martin: In a minute. Come on, birthday boy, I haven't given you your present yet I got him a brand-new rubber eeseburger-chay. "
"Niles: So, Frasier, can we convince you to join us? "
"Daphne: Oh, I don't think so, Dr. Crane. Your brother's been slaving away in the kitchen all afternoon. "
"Frasier: Actually, I'm having Caitlin over for dinner. "
"Niles: Oh... for dinner. "
"Frasier: I'll thank you to stop with your sniggering insinuations that Caitlin and I share nothing but the physical There are many things that we do share. Caitlin "
"Niles: Now they're sharing a Tic-Tac. "
"Frasier: Let me take your coat. Oh, you remember Niles, of course. And this is Daphne, Caitlin. "
"Caitlin: Hello. "
"Daphne: Hello. Don't worry, we'll be out of your way in a minute, just as soon as I can tear Mr. Crane away from Eddie. "
"Frasier: Yes, he's having a little birthday party for his dog. "
"Caitlin: Oh, how old is he? "
"Frasier: Too old to be having a birthday party for his dog. Anyway, can I interest you a drink? I've just opened a bottle of Conte de Bruillet "
"Caitlin: Oh, you must have been saving it. Burgogne hasn't made a decent Beaujolais in years. "
"Frasier: Well, do you hear that, Niles? Our Caitlin is a fellow oenophile "
"Caitlin: When I was little, my father owned a vineyard. I was the only kid on the block who would open a can of Hawaiian punch and let it breathe "
"Frasier: And we share that same quirky sense of humor [offers second glass] Would you care for a glass? "
"Caitlin: No thanks. Actually, I've always hated the taste of wine. "
"Niles: Finally, something I can use to tell you two apart. [takes the glass] "
"Frasier: A martini, then? "
"Caitlin: I cut out alcohol last year, along with processed sugar, dairy products and meat... Oh, I hope I'm not screwing up your menu What are you serving? "
"Frasier: Well, so far, parsley. But we'll make do. Let me get you a glass of mineral water. "
"Caitlin: Thanks. "
"Frasier: Please, help yourself to the melon slices. Just... unwind the prosciutto. "
"Niles: Frasier, I owe you an apology. You two are perfectly compatible. How long will it be before we're all standing outside a wedding chapel, pelting you both with whole-grain brown rice? "
"Frasier: Spare me your sarcasm. "
"Niles: Oh, come on. Let me have my fun. You're certainly having yours, even if you deny that that's what you're doing. "
"Frasier: Niles, I've already told you, I would never continue in a relationship if I didn't think there was a real future, and I happen to believe that there is in this one Have you ever heard of 'opposites attracting?' Where I am worldly, Caitlin is... unspoiled. "
"Niles: Rather remarkable, given her terror of preservatives. "
"Caitlin: Oh, Frasier, I just met your dad Did you know we're both Libras? "
"Martin: Which explains why I'm so 'perky, open-minded, and quick to tears.' "
"Caitlin: And don't forget 'Outgoing.' "
"Martin: No, I didn't. All right, everybody coming? "
"Caitlin: Well, it was nice meeting you all "
"Niles: Yes, nice to meet you too, Caitlin. "
"Frasier: I'll walk you to the door. "
"Niles: All right. "
"Frasier: Will you stop smirking It's going to take more than a harmless dabbling in astrology to dim the charm of this appealing young woman. "
"Caitlin: Oh my God This is the coolest chair "
"Frasier: Just get out "
"TO: "
"Martin: Morning, Frasier. "
"Frasier: Morning, Dad. "
"Martin: What's the matter? "
"Frasier: It's Caitlin. I'm in hell. Last night I experienced the most intense physical pleasure I've ever known. "
"Martin: Frasier, before you continue, I shared my bed last night with a dog. "
"Frasier: Well, that's not the problem, Dad. It's just that there's absolutely no future for me and Caitlin. "
"Martin: Well, I got to say I never thought there was. She's a flake. "
"Frasier: Well, that's not the point. Granted, there are aspects of her personality that I find off-putting— "
"Martin: Like her being a flake. "
"Frasier: Well, all right It's just difficult to walk away from something so intoxicating. "
"Martin: Fras, I'm just gonna say one "
"thing: watch out for this woman. I know how these things work. "
"Frasier: You've experienced something like this? "
"Martin: I didn't say that. I just know the type. Today she's got you going against your better judgment. Pretty soon, you'll be thinking about her all the time — losing sleep, missing work, neglecting your friends... and then pretty soon you'll get caught naked with her in the backseat of your squad car... But anyway, the point is, the longer you put this thing off, the harder it's going to be to end it. "
"Frasier: You're absolutely right, Dad. Got to nip this thing in the bud. I'm going to go over there right now. Doing anything else would just make me a hypocrite. [gets up and heads for the door] You know, just yesterday I dedicated an entire theme show to the importance of self-control. "
"Martin: You did? "
"Frasier: Doesn't anybody listen? "
"TO: "
"Caitlin: Who is it? "
"Frasier: Frasier. "
"Caitlin: Oh my God Why didn't you call first? Oh, I'm working on one of my collages. I'm covered in paint, I've got turpentine in my hair, I'm all sweaty— "
"Frasier: It'll only take a moment, I need to talk to you about something. "
"Caitlin: Oh, all right. But be nice "
"Frasier: Well, actually I... Good lord, you really do look... Good lord "
"Evening: Daphne opens the door to Roz, who's carrying some files. "
"Roz: Daphne, is Frasier here? "
"Daphne: No, he's not back yet. "
"Roz: He was supposed to meet me at the Café over an hour ago to finish this paperwork Now he can just do it himself. [drops it on the table] Can I use your powder room? "
"Daphne: Yeah, of course. "
"Niles: Obviously Frasier's attempt to break up with Caitlin has gone awry again. Thanks to him I have missed the wine tasting. What kind of weak-willed man allows a woman to come between him and a 1981 Cheval Blanc? "
"Daphne: You know, just out of curiosity, why didn't you go by yourself instead of sit here with me for half an hour? "
"Niles: I was worried about him, Daphne, worried sick. "
"Frasier: Hello, all. "
"Niles: Oh... "
"Daphne: Dr. Crane, were you at Caitlin's all this time? "
"Frasier: Heavens, no I, uh, I stopped by early this morning. We've decided to go our separate ways. And then, I, uh, met up with Roz, went over some paperwork... "
"Frasier: You know how she is these days. You know, get her on one of her troubles and yak-yak-yak-yak-yak "
"Frasier: And yet she makes every story so interesting I could listen to her for hours... "
"Roz: Knock it off, Frasier. Where have you been? "
"Frasier: Oh well, where do you think I've been? Trying to break up with Caitlin But did I do it? No And why? Because I'm Frasier, and I'm a sex-oholic "
"Roz: It's obvious what's happening here. You are having a purely sexual fling. It happens to all of us at some time in our lives. The one where the chemistry is perfect? Where you can't even be alone together in a room without tearing each other's clothes off and jumping each other — I mean, does this sound familiar? "
"Daphne: Yes... "
"Niles: Yeah... "
"Daphne: Everyone's had a relationship like that I know I have. His name was... no, I can't tell you "
"Daphne: It's too embarrassing "
"Niles: We're all friends here, we're trying to help Frasier. "
"Daphne: Yeah, well, it was so long ago, I don't even remember all the details. "
"Niles: Take a minute. "
"Daphne: Well... it all started one afternoon when I was sunbathing on the roof of our building. I was concerned about tan lines in those days. So, I decided to unhook my bikini top— [phone rings] I'll get it. "
"Roz: Gosh, mine was this lifeguard. He had long blond hair and the bluest eyes. He used to get so sunburned, I'd spend hours just peeling the skin off his back. What was his name? Rick? Nick I know there was an 'ick' sound. "
"Frasier: I was about to make one of those myself. "
"Daphne: My mother picks the worst times to call. Did I miss anything? "
"Niles: No, nothing. I believe you were starting to tell us a story? "
"Daphne: Oh yeah, that's right. Well, once I got my top off, I started thinking to myself, 'You know, I've never had an all-over tan.' So, I looked about to see if I was still alone, then I started to slip off my— Oh, the rolls are done. "
"Roz: We haven't heard anything from you, Niles. "
"Frasier: Oh, I don't think we're exactly in Niles's wheelhouse "
"Niles: I beg your pardon? "
"Frasier: Come on, Niles, I've heard your stories. They're not the steamiest stuff. "
"Niles: Obviously you've forgotten the semester I spent living in Paris. I'll have you know I had a torrid affair with a married woman. "
"Roz: Really? "
"Frasier: Well, I'm sorry, Niles. I had no idea. "
"Niles: It's not something I boast about. The attraction was simply overpowering. Every Thursday, two o'clock, the Hotel De Boulogne. We'd arrive separately, climb the stairs, open the door... Ooh-la-la. Oh, what an embrace Afterwards, she'd whisper to me, 'There's something so sweet in your eyes, and it'— "
"Frasier: 'Does me so much good,' said Emma Bovary If you're going to steal a love life, don't steal from the classics, you imbecile "
"Niles: The part about being in Paris is true. "
"Daphne: Here we are Got them out of the oven just in time. Another minute and I would have had burned buns. "
"Niles: Which brings us back to your story "
"Daphne: Well, there I was wearing nothing but a smile, when the sun started to shift. So I moved behind the water tower, and who was lying there but Derek — the good-looking fireman from across the hall? Who was also getting an all-over tan, I might add So, I had two choices. I could either tiptoe away or— Tea. "
"Niles: No, sit My God, must Daphne do everything around here? "
"Roz: I'll get it. I could use a glass of ice water anyway. "
"Frasier: You're not the only one. Let me give you a hand. "
"Roz: So, is any of this helping? "
"Frasier: Not much. "
"Roz: You know, I've got to make a point here. For as long as I've known you, you've been complaining about your lack of a sex life. Suddenly, you have one. So why are you still complaining? "
"Frasier: Well, it just seems wrong. I've thought a lot about this— "
"Roz: Ah, that's your problem. You've thought too much about this. You know, why don't you just stop listening to your head and start listening to your body? You're obviously enjoying this. Why do you have to feel so guilty? "
"Frasier: Well, it's just that I'm afraid I have no future with her. "
"Roz: So? "
"Frasier: Well, maybe she thinks that she has a future with me "
"Roz: Well, then it would be wrong. But is that how she feels? "
"Frasier: I don't know. "
"Roz: Ask her. If she feels the same way you do, you should just enjoy yourself. These things don't come around very often, and they don't last when they do. "
"Frasier: Well, you're right. Over-thinking things can certainly spoil anything. You know, it's funny, I gave the very same advice the other day on my show to that lawyer from Bainbridge. "
"Roz: I don't remember that. "
"Frasier: You were five feet away Doesn't anyone listen? "
"Daphne: And it wasn't until afterwards that we realized we'd rolled onto the skylight above the main stairwell Oh, we took some ribbing about that, we did "
"TO: "
"Caitlin: Well, I think I got everything under control. Dinner should be ready in about twenty minutes. "
"Frasier: Smells wonderful. "
"Caitlin: So do you. "
"Frasier: Caitlin, you know... "
"Caitlin: Yes? "
"Frasier: Well, I wanted to ask "
"you: where do you see this going? "
"Caitlin: Well, right now I'm heading to your earlobe, but if you'd care to reroute me, I'm open to suggestions— "
"Frasier: No, I mean our relationship. We've never talked about it. "
"Caitlin: Oh. Gee, I don't know. I guess I was kind of looking at this as a nice casual thing. I hope that doesn't disappoint you? "
"Frasier: No, not at all, I'm actually relieved I-I've been loving things the way they are too. "
"Caitlin: Yeah, we're just having some fun, right? "
"Frasier: Right — oh well, 'fun' doesn't begin to describe it I just wanted to make sure we were both on the same page. "
"Caitlin: Is that what's been on your mind? Because I thought you were tense these last few days. I even went and got some hot oil to give you a massage. But I guess we won't be needing that now. "
"Frasier: Well, I have been terribly worried about this global warming situation. "
"Caitlin: Oh well, we've got time before dinner I'll go get the oil "
"Frasier: I'm so glad we had this conversation "
"Caitlin: Yeah, me too I mean, I was starting to worry that you were scared off by my lifestyle. I mean, I'm pretty out there. "
"Frasier: Oh, Caitlin, Caitlin, I'm not as narrow-minded as all that. You know, I think we have a wonderful chemistry. That's enough to offset a few minor differences. "
"Caitlin: You can be taking your shirt off. "
"Frasier: Oh Same goes, by the way You know, I just love these converted loft spaces. I wonder what this one was before you moved in? Judging by these meat hooks — a slaughterhouse, huh? "
"Caitlin: No, I put those in. It was a day-care center. "
"Frasier: Oh, you artists and your whimsical decorating touches That's a mousetrap, isn't it? You get many mice? "
"Caitlin: I wish I use them in my art. "
"Fraiser: Dead mice? "
"Caitlin: Yeah, they're part of my newest collage series. It's all about mortality. "
"Frasier: Caitlin... you've cut your hair "
"Caitlin: Yeah, sometimes the spirit just grabs me, and I've got to do it It's really very freeing. Plus I think there's something great about using your body parts for practical use. "
"Frasier: Well, it's uh... it's different It's still beautiful, nonetheless. Is that all your hair? "
"Caitlin: It's mostly mine. "
"Frasier: You know, Caitlin, I'm thinking— "
"Caitlin: No, no, no, don't think [turns him around and sits him on the chair] The secret to a good massage is to let the mind rest, and listen to the body. "
"Frasier: Right. "
"Caitlin: Yeah... "
"Frasier: OK. Go ahead, Body... I'm listening. "
"Caitlin: Mmm... "
"Frasier: Oh God, yeah, that feels good. "
"Caitlin: You know, if we moved to the bed, I could give you a more thorough massage. "
"Caitlin: Oh, I just remembered, it's a full moon tonight "
"Caitlin: Look Isn't that beautiful? "
"Frasier: How romantic. You know, there's nothing like a full moon to make one— "
"Frasier: Caitlin? "
"Caitlin: I'm a member of the lycanthrope society. "
"Frasier: As in... werewolf? "
"Caitlin: Not literally. It's a group of women who believe that the moon controls our cycles, and this is our way of paying our respects. "
"Caitlin: Besides, you've heard me howl before. "
"Frasier: Well, yes, but in that context I took it as a compliment "
"Caitlin: Oh, Frasier, you're getting all tense again. It's the hair pillows, isn't it? "
"Frasier: Yes, that— "
"Caitlin: Oh, got one "
"Frasier: Among other things "
"Frasier: Listen, Caitlin, I'm starting to think that maybe this isn't such a good idea "
"Caitlin: What do you mean? "
"Frasier: Well, you know, we're just so different You know, I'm basically your stuffy, buttoned-down sort of guy You're, well, you're your free-spirited, adventurous, mouse- painting, moon-howling sort of girl Is even the most satisfying sexual relationship enough to bridge that gap? "
"Caitlin: Well, I think so. "
"Caitlin: What do you think? "

"Frasier: Dear God "
"Roz: Hey, Frasier. "
"Frasier: It's a minefield out there Everywhere I go, people are talking about this mini-series I've been watching "
"Roz: Oh, yeah Did you see the ending last night? When that... "
"Frasier: Bup, bup, bup, bup I attended a benefit last night. I had to tape it, and I have yet to see it. "
"Roz: Oh, well who would have thought it? Mr. 'PBS' watching a trashy mini-series. "
"Frasier: I don't think it's trashy at all In fact, I think the intricacies of the plot are downright Dickensian. "
"Roz: Yeah, Angie Dickensian "
"Frasier: Anyway, I'm just having a very difficult time having a conversation without having to avoid people telling me the ending. "
"Betty: Hi, Roz Did you watch last night? "
"Roz: Yes "
"Betty: Wasn't it great when... "
"Frasier: Yes, goodbye, Betty. "
"Daphne: Hey, Dr. Crane, how was your day? "
"Frasier: Interminable Is the tape in the VCR? "
"Daphne: Yes, all cued up. Oh, you've got to call me when you get to the part with Heather's baby. "
"Frasier: Heather had a baby? "
"Daphne: Sorry. "
"Frasier: Well, who's the father? Oh no, no, no, don't tell me. "
"Daphne: I'll go put your popcorn in the microwave. "
"Frasier: Thank you. "
"Martin: Hey, Fras. "
"Frasier: Hi, Dad. "
"Martin: Look, I got some bad news. I guess there isn't a good way to tell you somethin' like this. Your god-uncle died. "
"Frasier: There's no such thing as a god-uncle. "
"Martin: Yes there is It's your godfather's brother. You remember your god-uncle Charlie. "
"Frasier: No I barely even remember my godfather, he died twenty years ago. "
"Martin: Oh, yeah? Well now his brother's dead too, so shake a leg The wake's in twenty minutes. "
"Frasier: Dad, you know as much as I'd like to pay my respects, catch up with my god-cousins and meet the god-neighbors, I have some urgent business that just can't wait until later. "
"Daphne: All right, here's your popcorn...and the remote. There, enjoy your show. "
"Frasier: Oh, all right One hour I don't even know why I'm going. The man was a ghoul, he used to hide his glass eye in my marble bag "
"Martin: I knew you remembered him "
"Martin: Just give me a couple minutes to get changed. "
"Niles: Hello, Frasier. "
"Frasier: Hello, Niles. Ooh, Niles, you'd be smart to get out of here. Dad's dragging me off to a wake for my god-uncle Charlie. "
"Niles: Is he the one who used to plop his eyeball into his mashed potatoes and say 'I'm watching what I eat'? "
"Frasier: Yes "
"Niles: So, is Daphne here? "
"Frasier: Uh, yes, she is. Why? "
"Niles: I'm asking her out on a date. And don't give me that look... why shouldn't I? She's single. I'm single. That's what single people do. "
"Frasier: Are you sure you're ready for this? "
"Niles: Will you stop it? I'm not talking about eloping here, it's just dinner. "
"Frasier: Well, all right. I suppose you've thought this through. Maybe it is time. "
"Daphne: Time for what? "
"Frasier: Time for me to, uh, put this popcorn away for later. "
"Daphne: Aren't you going to watch your program? "
"Niles: Apparently he has to take Dad to a wake. "
"Daphne: Oh. "
"Niles: Listen, Daphne. Do you have a minute? "
"Daphne: Sure. "
"Niles: There's something I wanted to ask you. Nothing earth- shattering, it's just, uh... "
"Daphne: Yes? "
"Niles: What's that perfume you're wearing? "
"Daphne: Leave it to you to notice. It's Obsession. "
"Niles: No No it isn't I was just curious. "
"Daphne: No, I'm quite sure it's Calvin Klein's Obsession. "
"Niles: Oh, yes It's very pleasing. "
"Daphne: I've even spray a bit on my brush and comb it through my hair. Silly really, as if anyone's going to smell my hair. "
"Frasier: Well, what did she say? "
"Niles: I couldn't do it I was about to ask the question, then all I could think of was, what if she said 'No'?' "
"Frasier: Oh, Niles. No surprise. After all you've been through with Maris, you were just scared of another rejection. "
"Niles: I was more than scared, I was terrified. I can't go on like this. [He goes to the refrigerator to get a bottle of water.] Worshipping Daphne from afar... Do you have any idea how frustrating it is to be completely in love with someone and not be able to tell her how you feel? "
"Daphne: Sorry. I, I just came back for the fabric softener. I didn't mean... I'm sorry. "
"Niles: Oh, my God "
"Frasier: Oh, my God "
"Niles: Oh, my God Frasier, how long was she standing there? "
"Frasier: I don't know. If I'd known Daphne was standing there, I would have said 'Shut up, Daphne's standing there.' "
"Niles: You saw how she ran out of here. She heard. She heard everything. "
"Frasier: Niles, Niles, Niles. Listen, calm down. Now listen, this may even be for the best. You said you wanted to take the next step. "
"Niles: Next step? I was just hurled down the entire flight of stairs I can't believe this is actually happening Did Daphne really hear me say that I'm completely in love with - AAHH "
"Daphne: I'm sorry I really do need that fabric softener. "
"Frasier: Niles, you've got to talk to her "
"Niles: Now? I can't "
"Frasier: If you wait, it will only become incredibly awkward You can't leave things like this, Niles. [He grabs a sputtering Niles around the shoulders and pushes him towards the living room.] Come on, you've got to resolve it now. Go, go "
"Niles: Daphne "
"Daphne: Oh, Dr. Crane, I didn't mean... "
"Niles: Go ahead. "
"Daphne: I'm terribly sorry. I know I wasn't supposed to hear that. "
"Niles: No, I'm glad you heard. It's something I've been wanting to tell you for the longest time. "
"Daphne: Well, what took you so long? I think it's wonderful. "
"Niles: You do? "
"Daphne: Yes, of course I do [She puts the softener down and runs to him.] Oh, you dear sweet man, give me a hug "
"Daphne: So, who is she? "
"Niles: Who? "
"Daphne: Well, this woman you're so in love with. Who is she? "
"Niles: You didn't hear that part, did you? "
"Daphne: No, so come on What's her name? You can't back out now. "
"Niles: No, you're right, I can't. OK, her name. Well, her name just happens to be Da - Phyllis. [A look of 'WHAT did I say?' crosses his brow.] "
"Daphne: Oh, I've never heard that name. DaPhyllis. "
"Niles: It's a family name. Her friends call her 'Phyllis.' 'Scuse me. I'll get some water. "
"Frasier: Where's Niles? "
"Daphne: Oh, he's in the kitchen. I'm sorry to barge in on the two of you like that. "
"Frasier: Oh, that's all right Daphne. Did you and Niles have a little chat? "
"Daphne: Oh, yes He was a bit shy at first, but then he came clean. I must say, I couldn't be happier "
"Frasier: Well, that is wonderful Let me be the first to raise a glass to... [Niles charges in from the kitchen, alarm in his eyes and waves him off with a big gesture.] to god-uncle Charlie. You know, Daphne, as long as you're doing the laundry, the kitchen towels could use a washing. Oh, and my oven mitts are getting a bit crunchy. "
"Daphne: All, right then. "
"Frasier: What the hell is going on? "
"Niles: All she heard was that I was in love with someone. She never heard who. And when she asked, I panicked and blurted out the first name that popped into my head - Phyllis. "
"Frasier: Phyllis? "
"Niles: It's a neighbor I saw on the elevator this morning. The woman had a sesame seed stuck between her front teeth. It was the size of a blanched almond. "
"Frasier: Oh, lord. "
"Niles: Maybe it was a blanched almond. If she had Muselix for breakfast it could have been... "
"Frasier: Niles, stop You have got to clear this up. "
"Frasier: Oh, well, I'm off to...bring the car around for Dad. "
"Daphne: Bye-bye. "
"Niles: Bye. "
"Daphne: All right "
"now: Tell me more about this Phyllis. "
"Niles: Oh. Actually, Daphne, I'd rather not. "
"Daphne: Oh, come on, you said you wanted to talk about it. So, have you asked her out, yet? "
"Niles: No. "
"Daphne: And why not? You said yourself you were in love with her. "
"Martin: In love with who? "
"Daphne: Phyllis. "
"Martin: Who's Phyllis? "
"Niles: A woman I met. "
"Daphne: And he's quite keen on her. I've just been giving him some dating advice. "
"Martin: Oh, Niles. All you need to know is that women go crazy for flattery. It doesn't matter if it's a big fat "
"lie: They'll still buy it. But whatever advice Daphne's giving you too, must be great. 'Cause she's smart as a whip. "
"Daphne: Oh, thank you Mr. Crane. "
"Daphne: So, tell me about this dream woman of yours. "
"Niles: Oh, I don't know. "
"Daphne: Oh, come on I can see you're crazy about her. "
"Niles: Well, all right. She's very beautiful. And very sweet. And she has a smile that makes my knees weaken. [Daphne smiles at this and Niles looks away as his heart speeds up a bit.] "
"Daphne: You know Dr. Crane, if this woman is as wonderful as you say she is, then you shouldn't waste another moment. She won't be on the market forever. "
"Niles: You're right. I've been a fool to hesitate as long as I have. "
"Daphne: That's the spirit "
"Niles: I'm gonna do it "
"Daphne: Good for you Don't leave time for second thoughts. [She grabs his coat from the hall.] You go ask her out this instant. "
"Niles: Daphne, that won't be necessary. "
"Daphne: I know you're feeling brave, but it's quite nasty out. "
"Niles: No, you don't understand. I don't have to leave this room to ask 'Phyllis' on a date. "
"Daphne: You don't? "
"Niles: No, because, because you see, "
"Daphne: I know her work number by heart "
"Daphne: Well, then "
"Daphne: Oh, look at me My heart's racing "
"Niles: Mine, too. Phyllis, hello Niles Crane How are you? ... Um, I was wondering if you would want to have dinner with me sometime? "
"TO: Niles' apartment at the Montana. The answering machine is "
"Niles: You would? How 'bout tonight at my place? ... Eight o'clock sounds great "
"Niles: So, anyway, what would you do, if you were in my position? Would you tell her everything and just let the chips fall where they may, or...? Uh, yeah. Well I do see your point. I have to run. So, I'll take the three-year subscription and the travel clock. "
"Niles: Daphne "
"Daphne: Hello. I was out doing some shopping, and I, I thought you might need some desert for your big dinner with Phyllis tonight. "
"Niles: Oh, yes Well, I was just doing some last minute tidying up for that... "
"Daphne: And I suppose you've got about eight things cooking on the stove. "
"Niles: Of course. "
"Daphne: So, I'll get out of your way. Soon as I pop this in the fridge. "
"Niles: No, no. Please, don't trouble yourself. I'll do it. "
"Daphne: Dr. Crane There's barely enough pasta her for one person. Is this your idea of a romantic dinner? "
"Niles: Well... "
"Daphne: Ugh, thank heavens I stopped by. I can whip up a salad with what's in here, I'll stick this roast in the microwave to defrost, where do you keep the cooking sherry? "
"Niles: You know what, Daphne, you're right. I am completely under- prepared for this. Why don't I call Phyllis and put her off until next week? "
"Daphne: You're not backing out of this now Don't worry, I'll fix this place RIGHT up for a nice intimate evening. Candles, some soft music... I know those things always put me in a romantic mood. "
"Niles: Well I suppose it would be rude of me to cancel... "
"Daphne: Course it would. Now hurry up and get ready And wear that blue blazer of yours, no woman can resist you in that. "
"Niles: Right. "
"Daphne: Good lord, look at the time [She grabs him by the shoulders and pushes him out of the kitchen.] Honestly, Dr. Crane, sometimes I wonder what kind of a fantasy world you're living in. Now go on "
"TO: "
"Daphne: Oh, don't you look handsome. "
"Niles: Thank you. Daphne, this place looks wonderful. And excellent choice of music, I love this aria "
"Daphne: Yes, she has a gorgeous voice, doesn't she? It's a pity she never got quite the recognition of a Joan Sutherland or a Renata Tebaldi. "
"Niles: I had no idea you knew so much about sopranos. "
"Daphne: Yeah, well, you don't live with your brother for five years and not learn a thing or two about divas. [They laugh as she moves to the kitchen.] By the way, the roast is coming along nicely. How are you at chopping vegetables? "
"Niles: Are you kidding? You don't get forearms like these from just... conducting your stereo. "
"Daphne: Oh, I'm very excited for you. I just love first dates. "
"Niles: I don't see why. They're always so awkward. "
"Daphne: Yeah, but once in a while, when the chemistry's just right, they can be magical. The 'me, too's' as you realize all you have in common, the electricity of that first accidental touch... Soon, you're letting your guard down and saying the silliest things. "
"Niles: Oh, sorry. You touched me, now we have to get married. "
"Daphne: Here you are. [She hands him a towel. Again, he has a 'WHAT did I just say?' look.] "
"Niles: Sorry. "
"Daphne: Sorry. Now, I was thinking for the "
"salad: some cucumbers and carrots. How 'bout some celery? [She begins cutting carrots as he slices the cucumber.] "
"Niles: Oh, no. No celery, hate the stuff. "
"Daphne: Me, too. Why do you have it, then? "
"Niles: I guess it's just habit. Maris used to liked to have it around in case she felt like binging. "
"Daphne: When I was little, I actually thought celery was the meanest vegetable. Radishes were the smartest, beets were the policemen... "
"Niles: Do you hear that? We're chopping in rhythm. "
"Daphne: Yes, we are, aren't we? Dum-da, dum-da, dum-da, dum-da... "
"Niles: Heart and soul, I fell in love with you, Heart and soul, The way a fool would do... "
"Both: Madly Because you held me tight, and stole a kiss in the night "
"Niles: Buh-buh-buh... "
"Niles: Oh, damn Who could that be? "
"Daphne: It's Phyllis "
"Daphne: Well go on Go and let her in. "
"Niles: Go away, whoever's at the door, Go away, And don't come back no more... "
"Niles: Frasier I thought you were supposed to be at a wake. "
"Frasier: We left Even the mourners were babbling about the mini- series. "
"Niles: Well, I'm sure you're in a rush to get back home and watch the rest of the show... "
"Frasier: No, no, Niles. Actually, everybody's heading over to the Kiwanis club to have a post-wake kegger. Could you please take Dad? "
"Niles: Me? "
"Frasier: Please "
"Niles: Well, they're your god-family "
"Daphne: Oh, Dr. Crane. I thought you were Phyllis. "
"Frasier: Phyllis? "
"Daphne: Yeah, she's due any moment, so you better be runnin' along. I'll be leaving meself as soon as the roast is done. "
"Frasier: Daphne... is cooking dinner... for your date with a fictitious woman. Why not just set a place for the March Hare and the Mad Hatter? "
"Niles: I didn't plan for this to happen, but we are having the most perfect evening I'm feeling my confidence return, I just need a few more minutes alone, and I'll be able to tell her everything. "
"Frasier: Niles, the longer you continue with this absurd lie, the more likely it is to blow up in your face "
"Niles: Why are you always such a doomsayer? As long as I keep track of what I'm saying, nothing is going to blow up on anyone Phyllis "
"Frasier: Ka-Boom "
"Phyllis: Hello, Dr. Crane. Some of you mail wound up in my box today. "
"Niles: Oh, well, aren't you considerate? "
"Phyllis: Hello. "
"Frasier: Hello, I'm Frasier, Niles's brother. "
"Phyllis: Oh, well, I hope I'm not interrupting anything. "
"Niles: As a matter of fact, we... "
"Daphne: Hello... You must be Phyllis "
"Phyllis: Yes. Do I know you? "
"Daphne: I'm Daphne. I'm just a friend. [She heads back to the kitchen.] Make yourself comfortable. We were starting to worry about you. "
"Phyllis: Excuse me? "
"Daphne: Can I get you a glass of wine? "
"Phyllis: Well, all right, I guess. I mean I really just came by to drop off... "
"Daphne: I'll be back in a snap. "
"Phyllis: That woman seemed to think that you were expecting me. "
"Niles: Yes, I've been making an effort to meet my neighbors, and I guess you didn't get the invitation. "
"Phyllis: No. It's just dumb luck that I happened to stop by tonight. "
"Daphne: Here we are. Now, the appetizers are almost ready, and it won't be too much longer before the roast is done. I hope you're hungry. "
"Phyllis: Oh, the invitation was for dinner? "
"Niles: Yes, but don't you worry about it a bit, we'll do it another time "
"Phyllis: Well, I'd love to stay. "
"Martin: Hey, Niles. Frasier, you comin' or not? "
"Frasier: In a minute, Dad. "
"Martin: Oh, Daph What are you doing here? "
"Daphne: Helping Dr. Crane with his dinner. "
"Martin: Oh, hi How ya doin'? Marty Crane. "
"Phyllis: Hi, I'm Phyllis Conrad. "
"Martin: Oh, ho, ho. You're Phyllis, hunh? "
"Daphne: Don't worry, we'll be going soon. I know Dr. Crane's eager to have you all to himself. "
"Phyllis: Really? "
"Martin: Oh, yeah, he's been going on about you all week. "
"Niles: Now, Dad... "
"Martin: How pretty you are, how nice you dress... "
"Niles: Dad, you don't want to be late for your kegger... "
"Martin: Look at him I've embarrassed him. He's blushing "
"Phyllis: He's not the only one "
"Niles: Excuse me, Phyllis. Frasier? Could I, uh, just... [jerking his head towards a private corner] You've gotta help me get rid of her "
"Frasier: Me? "
"Niles: Yes "
"Frasier: I've got my hands full with Dad. "
"Martin: So, you really never had any idea he had his eye on you? "
"Phyllis: Well, I did catch him staring at me in the elevator, this morning. Now I know why. "
"Daphne: Dr. Crane, would you give me a hand with the appetizers? "
"Niles: Frasier? "
"Frasier: Dad? You know, I guess it was time we were going. Maybe you could just press for the elevator and I'll be right there in a minute. "
"Martin: All right. Very nice meeting you, Phyllis. "
"Phyllis: Yeah, bye-bye. "
"Phyllis: Well, I must "
"say: Your brother certainly kept his feelings to himself; until tonight. "
"Frasier: Yes, well, he's always been the quiet type. Especially... since all the trouble with Heather. "
"Phyllis: Heather? "
"TO: the kitchen; Daphne is giving Niles a plate of appetizers and "
"Daphne: Now remember, the pie should be heated, and there's fresh whipped cream to put on the strawberries. Or anything else if the night should take that turn... "
"Phyllis: His wife was poisoned? "
"Frasier: Don't worry. He stood trial, they never proved a thing. "
"Niles: Crab puffs? "
"Phyllis: No. Thank you. I, I just remembered. There is someplace... that I HAVE to be. Thank you very much for the wine. [to herself] Oh my God, I drank the wine "
"Niles: Well, thank you What did you tell her? "
"Frasier: I'll explain later, Niles. Tell you what, "
"though: don't plan on running for the co-op board here anytime soon. "
"Daphne: Where'd Phyllis go? "
"Niles: She left. She said she wasn't feeling well. "
"Daphne: I hope you don't mind my saying so, you almost seem relieved that she's gone. "
"Niles: Relieved? Well, Daphne, to tell you the truth, I am relieved. "
"Daphne: I knew it. This is all my fault. "
"Niles: Hmm? "
"Daphne: It's as clear as day, now. You're just not ready for a relationship, and there I was pushing you into it "
"Niles: Daphne... "
"Daphne: Even I could see how uncomfortable you were with Phyllis. Well, she must have picked up on that, too, and that's the real reason she left. What was I thinking? [She sits down on the couch.] "
"Niles: No, Daphne, this is not your fault. "
"Daphne: Yes, but I should have seen. You're on the rebound, you're still vulnerable... That's probably why you have so much trouble asking for a simple date in the first place. "
"Niles: Yes, I, I suppose you're right. "
"Daphne: I'm so sorry, Dr. Crane, I guess you just need to take some more time. You know, if you rush things you may end up ruining something that has a real chance. No smart woman would ever get involved with a man that's in the middle of a divorce, anyway. I know I never would. "
"Niles: Well, thank you, Daphne. This has all been very helpful. AND thank you for everything you did tonight, even if it didn't work out exactly as I'd hoped. "
"Daphne: Oh, what are friends for? "
"Daphne: I suppose we should start clearing all this up. "
"Niles: Actually, Daphne... would you like to stay and have dinner with me? "
"Daphne: You mean that? "
"Niles: Yes. "
"Daphne: Well... yes, that would be lovely. "
"Niles: Wonderful. May I pour you some wine? "
"Daphne: Oh, yes. You know, I know it seems hopeless right now, but I have a feeling that before very long you'll be sitting down to a nice, romantic dinner with the woman of your dreams. "
"Niles: I think you may just be right. Shall we? "
"Daphne: Oh, thank you. "
"Daphne: Here's to us "

"Frasier: Hello, Niles. "
"Niles: Oh, Frasier, listen to "
"this: “Michael Hawkins of Allentown, Pennsylvania, has agreed to donate his right lung to his younger brother Clovis. Says Hawkins, ‘I got two lungs, but I only got one brother.’” Isn't that something? "
"Frasier: It certainly is. "
"Niles: The love one brother feels for the other. "
"Frasier: Hmm, what do you want? "
"Niles: I need you to come to a dog show with me. "
"Frasier: I would rather give you a lung Latte, please. "
"Niles: Frasier, I beg you. It's at the Seattle Kennel Club tomorrow night and I can't go alone, Maris will be there. "
"Frasier: And in what class will Maris be showing? "
"Niles: She'll be showing no class As she has ever since she hooked up with that reptile, Dr. Schenkman. This will be my first time seeing them since we filed for divorce. "
"Frasier: You know, here's an idea, "
"Niles: Don't go "
"Niles: I've never missed the kennel club show. If I don't go this year, people will think I've let Maris and Schenkman intimidate me I want to prove that I'm strong and independent, and I can't do that alone. "
"Frasier: Well, all right Niles, if it's moral support you need, I'll go with you. "
"Niles: I'll pick you up around eight. "
"Frasier: All right. "
"Niles: Thank you, thank you, I knew I could count on you for this, Frasier. It's nice to know that some things never change. "
"Roz: Do you guys know where I can get a cheap hotel room in a hurry? "
"Niles: Case in point Goodbye, Roz. "
"Frasier: Roz, why do you need a hotel room? "
"Roz: I was supposed to move into my new place today, but they're still painting it. I can't be around those fumes, and they've already rented my old apartment. [to waitress who is bringing Frasier's coffee] Grandé decaf Latte, please. I am literally on the streets. "
"Frasier: You just ordered a four-dollar cup of coffee. 'On the street' may be a tad dramatic. "
"Roz: Well, I've got to start calling around, see if I can find something. "
"Frasier: You know Roz, if you're stuck, my dad's going to San Francisco for the weekend. You can always stay with me. "
"Roz: Wow That would sure make things easier. Okay. "
"Frasier: Well then, that's settled. That's that, then. "
"Roz: Oh, you were just being polite, you didn't really mean for me to take you up on it. "
"Frasier: No, no, no, no. I wouldn't have suggested it if it wasn't something I wanted to do. You should know that. "
"Roz: All right. "
"Waitress: Here you go. There's your check. "
"Roz: I'll get that. "
"Frasier: No, no, no, let me get that. "
"Roz: Okay. "
"Frasier: Well then, lucky me - I'm getting everything I want today. "
"Martin: Well it's about time "
"Frasier: Calm down, dad. "
"Martin: I was starting to get worried. "
"Frasier: We've got plenty of time. "
"Martin: My plane leaves at five ó clock. "
"Frasier: I just stopped off for your blood pressure medicine. "
"Martin: I don't need it "
"Frasier: Well, pack it anyway "
"Martin: What's this? Earrings? "
"Frasier: Oh, just a little something I picked up for Daphne at the drug store. She ran some errands for me last week. "
"Martin: Nice. What are they, sapphires? "
"Frasier: Yes dad, I always buy precious stones at the same counter I pick up corn pads and Wart Be-Gone "
"Daphne: Shouldn't you two be going? "
"Frasier: Oh, actually Daphne, we're just on our way but first there's a little something I wanted to give you - just a little token of my appreciation. "
"Daphne: Oh, Dr. Crane, you remembered "
"Frasier: Well, of... course I did. "
"Daphne: Can you believe it was five years ago today that I came to work here? I just knew you wouldn't let an important occasion like this go by unnoticed, but I wasn't expecting a gift. "
"Frasier: Well, it's a small gift, a tiny gift... "
"Daphne: Oh my God, sapphires "
"Frasier: Well, actually Daphne... "
"Daphne: Oh, Dr. Crane, these must have cost a fortune "
"Frasier: Well, I- "
"Daphne: You know my friend Molly got a diamond bracelet from her boss but she worked for him for ten years and she was sleeping with him And now I've got sapphires And I didn't even have to sleep with you Although now that I've got the sapphires - Oh God, what am I saying? I'm giddy Is it rude if I go and try these on? I don't care I have to see what these look like I've never had real jewelry, before, never I'm speechless "
"Frasier: Dear God, she believes they're genuine sapphires. "
"Martin: Gee, ya think? "
"Frasier: I'm going to have to tell her the truth. "
"Martin: Why? Didn't you see how happy she was, just let her enjoy them. "
"Frasier: I can't let her think I gave her something I didn't. Honesty between friends is far more precious than any gem. I'm sure Daphne feels exactly the same way. "
"Daphne: I feel like a princess I'm never going to take them off Oh thank you, "
"Frasier: Daphne, you know, I'm glad you like them... "
"Daphne: And you even remembered that sapphires are my birthstone. Is there no end to your thoughtfulness? "
"Frasier: Somebody has to keep track of these things. "
"Martin: You know, I really should be getting to the airport "
"Frasier: All right dad, I'll get my keys "
"Daphne: No, no, absolutely not, I'll drive Mr. Crane. From now on you're not lifting a finger around here. You ring for the elevator, I'll just grab my coat. "
"Martin: All right, but don't dawdle. My flight's at five, they told me to get there an hour early. "
"Frasier: Did you remember to pack your medicine? "
"Martin: Yes, but I told you, I don't need it "
"Roz: Hey, guys. "
"Martin: Hey, Roz. Frasier, help her with that. [he does] "
"Roz: Thanks, and thanks for letting me use your room. "
"Martin: No problem. "
"Roz: So, you're off to San Francisco. "
"Martin: Yeah, yeah. Duke and I took our shore leave there in '52. We're going back to retrace out steps. "
"Roz: That sounds like fun. "
"Martin: Yeah, yeah. We had a great time that weekend. Back then there was no place like Frisco for a single guy cruising the streets looking for a good time. "
"Frasier: You know dad, I think you'll find that Frisco hasn't changed all that much. "
"Martin: Well, I hope not "
"Roz: Bye. "
"Martin: Bye. "
"Daphne: Hey, Roz. Just off to the airport, back in a bit, see you later. "
"Frasier: Come on in, Roz. "
"Roz: Thanks. "
"Frasier: Actually, you're here a little earlier than I expected. "
"Roz: Yeah, I had to get out of the apartment sooner than I thought. I left you a message. "
"Frasier: Oh, frankly I didn't check my machine all day today. "
"Roz: Listen Frasier, thank you so much for this. I won't be an imposition, I promise. You won't even know I'm here. "
"Machine: You have 13 messages. "
"Roz: I had my calls forwarded, I hope you don't mind. "
"Marco: Roz, it's Marco. I'm coming to town this weekend. Are you busy Saturday night, late? Call me. "
"Roz: Obviously, Marco and I haven't talked for a long time. "
"Frasier: Something tells me you never talked for a long time. "
"Paula: Roz, this is Paula Garrett, Rick's mom. [Roz looks up, alarmed] We just found out about the baby and well, we think it's important that we meet you. Uh, we're leaving to see Rick in Paris the day after tomorrow, so anytime before that will be fine. I'm running out now, maybe I'll try you later. "
"Roz: Oh my god "
"Frasier: Now Roz, just calm down. "
"Roz: What do they want? "
"Frasier: Maybe they just want to meet you. They are the grandparents of your child. "
"Roz: Look, I worked all this out with Rick He's twenty years old, he's still in college and it's best for everyone if I raise this baby by myself. "
"Frasier: I know that, but... "
"Roz: Now I'm supposed to put up with in-laws and I don't even have a husband? That's like posing nude for your art teacher and still flunking the course. Shut up I needed the credits "
"Frasier: Roz, listen, all they want is a short meeting. "
"Roz: Yeah, well, that's what they say now. What if they want another one after that? What if they won't leave me alone, what if - what if they don't think I'm a fit mother? "
"Frasier: What if they turn out to be nice supportive people that you're glad to have in your life? "
"Roz: I just don't want to do this, Frasier It's not comfortable. "
"Frasier: Oh Roz... You know what, I could go with you, if you like? Oh, better yet, we can have them here tomorrow night. Niles and I have a dog show around eight o’clock. They can come before that. "
"Roz: I don't know. "
"Frasier: I'll bet that's Mrs. Garrett. "
"Roz: I'm not here. "
"Frasier: Hello. Yes, she is. Yes, she did get your message. No, no, I'm afraid she won't be able to meet you. Yes I understand that you're upset. I'm terribly sorry, goodbye. "
"Roz: Thank you, Frasier. Thank you. "
"Frasier: That was Marco, now we're calling Mrs. Garrett. "
"TO: "
"Roz: All right, give it to me straight. How do I look? "
"Frasier: Like Pollyanna grew up and got herself into a little trouble. "
"Roz: Oh, why am I doing this? How did I let you talk me into this? "
"Frasier: I will mean a lot to them. Besides, it's a chance to learn about your baby's lineage. A lot of things are inherited, you know. Like intelligence, artistic ability... "
"Roz: Oh God, it's them. I've got to check my makeup. "
"Frasier: Roz, there's no need to panic. You know, this should be fun It's like a little preview of who your child might be. "
"Steve: Hi there, Steve Garrett. "
"Steve: My wife's just... uh, honey? "
"Paula: Well, it was nice seeing you too "
"Paula: Oh, what a coincidence, your neighbor goes to my hair salon. Hi, I'm Paula. "
"Frasier: Frasier Crane. Won't you please come in? Roz'll be out in a second. She just went to powder her... self. "
"Steve: We hope this isn't too awkward for her. She sounded a little anxious on the phone. "
"Paula: Then again, who could blame her? She doesn't know what kind of people we are. A situation like this is enough to make anyone a little nervous. "
"Frasier: Well, actually you know, Roz really isn't the nervous type. "
"Frasier: Roz, this is Steve and Paula Garrett. "
"Roz: Hi. "
"Steve: Hi... oh, that's alright Roz, we don't blame you for being shocked. "
"Paula: I mean, we're used to it. You should see the looks we get. "
"Steve: You were a little taken aback yourself, weren't you, Dr. Crane? "
"Frasier: Oh-ho-ho, certainly not "
"Paula: Oh, come on, it's alright Everyone comments on it. "
"Frasier: Well, I must admit when I opened the door I... "
"Paula: ...couldn't believe we were old enough to have a twenty year-old son. "
"Frasier: Exactly You know, you both look so young. Don't they, Roz? "
"Roz: Yes... young. Very, very, young. "
"Paula: Oh Roz, I can see you're feeling a little uncomfortable, so let's just say, right up front, that we have no intention of intruding on your life. "
"Steve: Rick told us what a wonderful person you are. We just wanted to meet you and offer any help or support that you think is appropriate. "
"Roz: Thanks. That's very nice. "
"Daphne: I thought your guests might be a little peckish. "
"Frasier: Oh, Daphne Moon, Steve and Paula Garrett. "
"Daphne: Hello, I... "
"Daphne: I... "
"Frasier: I know It's amazing, isn't it? They are actually the parents of a twenty year-old. "
"Daphne: Amazing. "
"Frasier: Oh, excuse me. Oh, Niles. You're an hour early. "
"Niles: I'm sorry - hey, Roz. Yeah, I thought you might like to grab a bite to eat before the dog show. Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't realize that you had... "
"Niles: Had... "
"Frasier: Company, yes Steve, Paula Garrett, this is my brother, Niles Crane. The Garretts are the grandparents-to-be of Roz's baby. "
"Niles: Oh Well, nice to meet you. Hey, Daphne. "
"Paula: Did I hear you mention you're going to a dog show? "
"Niles: Yes, the Seattle Kennel Club is having its annual event tonight. "
"Paula: You know, Steve and I went to that a few years ago. We just love dogs We have two giant Schnauzers. "
"Steve: My goodness, Paula look at the view "
"Frasier: Roz, why don't you show the Garretts the view? "
"Paula: Oh yes, that would be nice. I could use a breath of fresh air "
"Frasier: Just stop it, the two of you My God, you're acting like a couple of two year-olds "
"Martin: I'm home. "
"Frasier: Dad? What are you doing here? "
"Martin: Aw, Frisco was a bust All our watering holes are gone, the steak house was a sushi bar, and this morning Duke and I went out for a walk. We passed City Hall, and there's this big crowd, kinda like a pep rally or something. So, we joined them. Well, some official guy up front says something that we didn't hear and the next thing you know, everybody's throwing rice and all the men are kissing each other and all the women are kissing each other, and I'm not sure but I think Duke and I may be married. "
"Martin: Well, the whole weekend was like that Just one surprising event- AAH "
"Steve: I-I'm sorry, did we startle you? "
"Martin: Oh, no, no, I-I didn't know we had company. "
"Frasier: Dad, Dad, this is Steve and Paula Garrett. They're Rick's parents, you remember Rick? "
"Martin: Oh sure, yeah Hi, how are ya? Nice to meet you, Marty Crane. "
"Roz: Oh, they're just on their way to Paris to visit Rick. "
"Martin: Oh, yeah? That sounds like fun. "
"Paula: Yeah, I'm just a little nervous. I hear the Parisians can be kinda snooty. "
"Daphne: Excuse me, I've got something in the oven. [turns to the kitchen] "
"Niles: Let me help you. "
"Martin: Yeah, uh, me too "
"Daphne: We've got to stop, they'll hear us "
"Steve: Mmmm, what's that I smell? "
"Martin: Probably Japan "
"Frasier: What is the matter with you people? "
"Martin: Oh, come on Fras Don't tell us you don't think this is funny "
"Frasier: Not in the slightest These are two perfectly nice people, who happen to have large noses The three of you standing in here, sniggering like school childen Well, all right, fine. If you can't get yourselves under control you can just stay in here "
"Frasier: Quiche Lorraine, anyone? "
"Steve: Quiche her? I hardly know her "
"Paula: Oh, Steve "
"Frasier: "
"Steve: Boy, that smells wonderful. "
"Paula: Does it ever. "
"Paula: Do you mind if I ask? Is this homemade or store-bought? "
"Steve: Honey, don't ask that Pardon my wife, sometimes she gets a little nosey. "
"Paula: Me nosey? You're the nosey one in the family. "
"Steve: Anyone who knows you knows you're nosey "
"Paula: Anyone who knows you knows you're nosier "
"Martin: Something wrong, Fras? "
"Frasier: I just got that "
"Time: 13"
":47) "
"Frasier: You know Roz, in spite of a rather shaky beginning, I think this evening's turned out rather well. "
"Roz: Oh yeah, and you were absolutely right, Frasier. Now I can see some of the qualities my baby can have. A great sense of humor... a sweet disposition... a nose like an ANT- EATER "
"Frasier: Frankly Roz, I think you're making a big deal out of nothing. As I remember, Rick had a perfectly fine nose, and so do you. I'm sure your baby's going to have one too. "
"Roz: Maybe you're right. If Rick can beat those genes, my baby has a chance. "
"Paula: So, how long have you been working for Dr. Crane? "
"Daphne: Five years just yesterday. In fact, he gave me a beautiful pair of sapphire earrings to mark the occasion. "
"Niles: Frasier gave you sapphires? "
"Frasier: Who's for coffee? "
"Steve: I'll take some. "
"Paula: You know, you really must show those earrings to my husband. He's a jeweler, you know. He could probably even tell you what mine the stones came from. "
"Frasier: Well, you know, maybe coffee's a bad idea if you've got that early flight in the morning. Daphne, could you just take this back into the kitchen for me? "
"Daphne: Oh dear, one of my earrings has gone It must have fallen off somewhere "
"Paula: We'll help you find it. "
"Steve: What does the earring look like? "
"Frasier: No, no, that's not really necessary. Once you've seen one sapphire, you've seen them all. "
"Steve: Well, that's not exactly true, they vary widely in quality. "
"Frasier: You know, why don't you just get up? You have to get going, you know, we have plenty of people in order to form a search party. And you know, we'll just trample each other. Well, good night. "
"Paula: Alright, we are going to have a big day tomorrow. "
"Frasier: Uh-huh, and you might as well get a little sleep before you take off. "
"Steve: You know, if you can't find that earring, I might be able to replace it. Can I see the other one? "
"Daphne: Oh, . "
"Frasier: I've got it Here it is. Bon voyage "
"Daphne: Thank you, Dr. Crane. "
"Frasier: Alright, Daphne, just a second. Well, listen, it was wonderful of you to come. "
"Steve: Thank you for having us. Roz, it was great meeting you. "
"Paula: Our door is always open. "
"Roz: Thank you. You guys have a great trip. "
"Frasier: Goodnight. "
"Daphne: Goodnight. "
"Steve: Goodnight. "
"Daphne: Can I have it then? "
"Frasier: Oh, I'm sorry, it's just a piece of lint. Well, the search continues. "
"Daphne: I feel just terrible The one precious thing that anyone has ever bought me in my whole stinking life, and I lose it. "
"Niles: Daphne, I found it. "
"Daphne: Oh, Dr. Crane, I could kiss you "
"Niles: Okay. "
"Daphne: What's this? "
"Niles: Nothing. "
"Daphne: The setting's come loose. It's only blue on top, the bottom's all coppery. Dr. Crane... "
"Frasier: I know what you're thinking Daphne, and you're right. Obviously I... "
"Daphne: You've been swindled Where did you buy these? I want to take these back and tell that lying cheat exactly what I think of him. "
"Frasier: Actually, you just did. "
"Daphne: You knew? "
"Roz: Uh, Niles, how about a cup of coffee? "
"Niles: Thanks, Roz, cream and sugar. "
"Frasier: I'm terribly sorry, Daphne, I meant to tell you eventually. "
"Niles: You didn't need to. Her earlobe's already turning green. "
"Frasier: Shut up, Niles You see Daphne, the truth is, I didn't remember your anniversary and well, I saw them and I thought they were pretty, so I bought them for you. You thought they were genuine, you seemed so happy... "
"Daphne: They are pretty. I suppose I can have them repaired. I'll just take them back to the jewelry store. "
"Frasier: Actually, I bought them at Raymond's. "
"Daphne: Raymond's drug store? "
"Niles: Well, the good news is that they'll carry something for that ear infection- "
"Frasier: SHUT UP "
"Paula: It's us again Gee, I almost forgot. Roz, I brought you something. I thought you might get a kick out of these. Here are some pictures of Ricky when he was a boy. "
"Roz: Oh, thank you, that is so nice of you. Well, where is he? I don't see him. "
"Steve: There, in the middle. "
"Roz: Oh... he looks so different. "
"Steve: Oh, right, that was before his hockey accident. The nose job changed his whole face. "
"Paula: I mean, not that the doctor didn't do a good job, but that's the Ricky you'll see in the baby. "
"Roz: Well, thanks. Thanks a lot. "
"Paula: Oh, you're welcome. And bye again. "
"Frasier: Take care. "
"Steve: Thanks. "
"Frasier: Good to see you. "
"Roz: Oh my GOD "
"Frasier: Oh, come on, Roz It can't be that bad, let me have a look "
"Roz: No, no way, no I'll never hear the end of it "
"Frasier: Please. "
"Niles: Where is the end of it? "
"Daphne: Oh, Roz, you're not still looking at that picture, are you? "
"Roz: Nope, this is a different one. "
"Daphne: Oh dear, look at the way the ears on this poor little girl stick out. "
"Roz: It's me. Aged nine, the year before I got them fixed. "
"Daphne: Sorry, Roz, I didn't recognize you with those glasses. Why is one side blacked out? "
"Roz: I had a lazy eye. "
"Roz: I got that fixed the next year. Let's just say for birthdays I wasn't asking for ponies. "
"Daphne: You poor thing. "
"Roz: I'm just sitting here thinking, what if my kid gets Rick's nose, and my ears and eyes? Throw in my grandfather's third nipple, I might as well pitch a tent and charge admission. "
"Daphne: Oh come on, nothing like that's going to happen. "
"Roz: I just hate the idea of my kid being teased. I know what that's like. As long as my baby's in here [rubs her womb] I can protect it from anything. But pretty soon this kid's going to be out there on his own. "
"Daphne: Every child goes through a bit of teasing. I mean, it's a part of growing up. At least yours will be lucky enough to have a mother who understands what it feels like. And you'll know just what to say to make it all better. "
"Roz: I really hadn't thought of it that way. "
"Daphne: Well, I'm pretty good at finding the positive in things. I mean, look at what happened to me tonight; I could say, here I've worked for someone for five years and he forgot my anniversary and bought me a worthless piece of blue glass. But I'd rather say he gave me a nice pair of earrings just because he thought I'd like them. Which is really rather sweet when you think about it. "
"Roz: Yeah well, Frasier will be pleased to hear that "
"Daphne: Oh, I'm not going to tell him Well, I'm ready for bed. "
"Roz: Yeah, me too. Thanks again, Daphne. "
"Daphne: Yep, you're welcome. "
"Roz: Ooh I just felt a big kick. "
"Daphne: You sure it wasn't a sneeze? "
"Roz: Oh, ha-ha "
"Daphne: That's the last one, I promise "

"Martin: Geez, look at this stuff. 'Golden Sunset Retirement Village,' 'Investments for Seniors,' 'Willow Brook Mortuary'? What the hell kind of list am I on? "
"Daphne: Well, the good news is I don't think it's the kind of list they keep you on very long. "
"Martin: Oh, ever since I turned sixty-five, all I get is geezer mail. It's very depressing. "
"Daphne: If you ask me, the only thing depressing about being a geezer is looking like one. There's lots of things a person can do to make himself look younger. How he dresses... "
"Martin: Nah, I tried those Jordache jeans. I just think you oughta leave somethin' to the imagination. "
"Daphne: Well, there's always your hair. I know it's not exactly your style, but there's nothing wrong with covering up that gray. I know just the right shade for "
"you: cinnamon sable. "
"Martin: Cinnamon sable, huh? Sounds nice. Oh wait I couldn't use that, it's Duke's shade. He'd scratch my eyes out. "
"TO: the living room as Frasier answers "
"Frasier: Hello, Niles. "
"Niles: Frasier, prepare to salivate "
"Frasier: Niles, if that is a picture of your new Biedermeier loveseat, you've already shown it to me. "
"Niles: No, this is a photo of my latest "
"purchase: an exquisite, eighteenth-century Turkish prayer rug. Paid a fortune for it, but legend says whatever you pray for on this rug will come to you. "
"Frasier: Certainly worked for the dealer. Oh, I'm sorry Niles, I'm just not in the best of moods. I just had another disastrous blind date today. "
"Niles: Oh, I'm sorry. "
"Frasier: I mean, murderers on death row can find women to marry them I can't find one to sit through coffee "
"Niles: It's easy for those men to attract women, they have all that time to work out in the yard. "
"Frasier: I'm serious. I'm getting desperate here. "
"Niles: Don't obsess about this. My love life's not much better than yours, but you don't see me going off the deep end. "
"Frasier: Oh, really. Did it ever occur to you that this recent antique buying binge you've been on is nothing but a way of sublimating your frustrated sexual desires? "
"Niles: That's preposterous These purchases have nothing to do with sex. "
"Frasier: Oh, don't they? In addition to the loveseat, let's see, your most recent acquisitions have "
"been: a French bed- warmer... a pair of Toby jugs... the less said about that Civil War ramrod, the better. "
"Niles: Oh, you Freudians Sometimes a ramrod is just a... oh hell, even I can't make that one fly. "
"Frasier: Take heart, Niles. We're both in the same boat. The hard part is, where do you go to meet people? "
"Daphne: Oh, it's not that hard. Just yesterday I met a very nice man at the grocery. We got to talking, and he asked me if I was free Saturday night. I said, 'Yes.' He said, 'Oh, wait, that's my niece's bat mitzvah.' I said, 'I've never been to a bat mitzvah.' He said, 'Would you like to go to the bat mitzvah?' I said, 'Oh, yes. I'd love to go to the bat mitzvah.' So he said... "
"Frasier: Daphne? "
"Daphne: Yes? "
"Frasier: Oh, nothing, I'm sorry. Go on. "
"Daphne: Hmm... Oh, I seem to have lost my train of thought. Oh, well. Anyone like some tea? "
"Both: Oh, love some/Thank you, yes. "
"Frasier: A little trick I discovered a few weeks ago, it's a lifesaver. Anyway, as I was saying, where does one go to meet available women? "
"Niles: There are singles bars, of course. Uh, we could join a health club. "
"Frasier: Oh, there's a splendid idea. Yes, I can just picture the two of "
"us: tank tops and spandex. Find us a pair of matching headbands, we might as well just sterilize ourselves "
"Martin: Wow, sounds like fun, Daph. If she says 'bat mitzvah' one more time... Hey, Niles. "
"Niles: Hey Dad. Well, if you're so smart, you come up with an idea. "
"Martin: What're you guys talkin' about? "
"Frasier: Oh, just our pathetic love lives. "
"Martin: Well, you know, why don't you do what my buddies and I used to do when we were young and hard up for dates? "
"Frasier: Invade Korea? "
"Martin: No, we threw a party. With just one "
"rule: only single, available people were invited. "
"Frasier: Well, I don't know, Dad. That doesn't really sound like us. "
"Martin: Well, I don't know, it works. I used to throw one a month. People used to call them Marty Parties. People would call me up and say, 'Hey, Marty, when's the next Marty Party?' 'Isn't it about time for another Marty Party?' 'Sure had a great time at that last Marty Party' "
"Frasier: Uh, Dad? "
"Martin: Yeah? "
"Frasier: Oh, I'm sorry, nothing. "
"Martin: Or somebody might say, 'Can I host the next Marty Party?' "
"Frasier: It doesn't always work. "
"Niles: Yeah. Thanks Dad, but I don't think we're really quite hard-up enough yet to stage a singles party. "
"Martin: OK, suit yourself. Well, we'll just get ready for the evening. I'll dish out the spaghetti and you guys set up the card table. I got us a new jigsaw puzzle. Ten thousand pieces. It's called 'The Wheat Field.' "
"Frasier: I'll send the invitations. "
"Niles: I'll call the caterer. DOES HE OR DOESN'T HE? "
"Niles: Hello, welcome, please come in. "
"Frasier: Niles, this is wonderful. I had no idea we'd get such a turnout. "
"Niles: I know Everywhere I look, there's another woman I want to get to know better. "
"Niles: With some obvious exceptions. "
"Frasier: Roz, I didn't know you were coming. "
"Roz: Hey, I know it's a long shot, but I figured I better get out and do a little flirting, before I forget how. "
"Waiter: Can I offer you something? "
"Frasier: My God, Roz, you are rusty. "
"Roz: By the way, I know you've been striking out a lot lately, but I invited someone tonight guaranteed to improve your batting average. "
"Frasier: Not necessary, Roz. I've already met someone quite captivating... "
"Tina: Hi, Roz "
"Roz: Tina, you made it. "
"Tina: Oh, you know me. Have I ever said 'No' to a good time? "
"Roz: That's what I was trying to tell Frasier. Tina Cramer, meet Dr. Frasier Crane. "
"Frasier: Hello. "
"Tina: Doctor, huh? "
"Frasier: Yes, that's right. Roz? Roz? "
"Tina: Ooh, strong hands. I guess it's true what they "
"say: strong hands, strong mind. "
"Frasier: Yes, well, that's why you'll never see an unopened pickle jar at a Mensa meeting. "
"Tina: Huh? "
"Roz: Excuse me. Oh, excuse me. "
"Roz: Martin? "
"Martin: You're lookin' at my hair, right? "
"Roz: Well, yeah. Looks great. "
"Martin: Thanks. I did it myself. "
"Roz: Get out. "
"Martin: Yeah, yeah, really. Well, Daphne suggested it, and at first I said, 'No way,' but then I thought well, you know, a lot of other guys do it, and what better place to try it than here, where nobody knows who I am? Boy, you look great, too. "
"Roz: Oh, thanks. Yeah, I was really happy with this dress. You can't even tell I'm pregnant in it. "
"Martin: I know. I mean, it's just... Well, you have a great time at the party, the dress looks great, nobody'd know. "
"Roz: Same with your hair, looks completely natural. "
"Martin: Thanks. "
"Martin: Hey, Niles. "
"Niles: Hey, Dad. "
"Martin: Hey watch that 'Dad' business. I've got a few young ladies around here thinking I just might be your brother. "
"Niles: Yeah, it's like looking in a mirror. "
"Martin: What's the matter, aren't you having any fun? "
"Niles: Oh, sort of. It's just been so long since I've been single, I'm finding it hard to strike up conversations. "
"Martin: Oh, come on, now, it's nothing. You just need a little confidence. Here, watch this. "
"Martin: Hi there. "
"Vickie: Hi. "
"Martin: I'm Marty Crane, and this is my son Niles. Yep, my son. "
"Vickie: Hi, Vickie Cantrell. You're the host. "
"Niles: Yeah. "
"Vickie: I was just admiring your beautiful Turkish rug. "
"Niles: Thank you "
"Vickie: Is that eighteenth century? "
"Niles: Yes, it is. You have quite an eye. "
"Vickie: Well, I work for an auction house. I would love to see some of your other pieces. "
"Niles: Well, It would be my pleasure. You know there's an absurd old legend about that rug that whatever you pray for... Well, perhaps it's not that absurd after all. "
"Frasier: Roz Roz, that woman is all over me. "
"Roz: Well, of course she is Didn't you get what I was trying to tell ya? "
"Frasier: Yes of course I got it I also got it when she showed me how she can tie a knot in a cherry stem with her tongue. "
"Roz: That's a party trick. "
"Frasier: Except the cherry was in my mouth at the time Roz, I already tried to tell you that I've met a woman tonight. "
"Roz: All right. I'll go talk to her. "
"Frasier: Thank you. "
"Niles: Oh, Frasier. "
"Frasier: Niles. "
"Niles: I'm so glad we had this party I just met the most fabulous woman. "
"Frasier: Oh that's fabulous. "
"Niles: Two white wines. "
"Frasier: I also met someone who's terrific. "
"Niles: Oh, wait, wait. I can't wait. I have to show you mine first. She's over by the buffet. "
"Frasier: Right, so's mine. "
"Niles: Frasier, let me ask you "
"something: At what point would you like to acknowledge that we're both waving to the same woman? I saw her first "
"Frasier: That's not fair You're the host, you see everyone first "
"Niles: There are plenty of other women here "
"Frasier: Exactly, so go pick one "
"Niles: Oh, let's just stop this. The only civilized thing to do is for us to both stay away from her. We are psychiatrists, not a couple of rutting pigs in a barnyard. What do you say to that? "
"Frasier: Soo-eee. "
"Niles: Very well, may the better man win. "
"Roz: Frasier, your father wants you. "
"Niles: Ah, advantage Niles "
"Frasier: What? "
"Martin: I want you to meet a big fan of yours. Kathy Lockher, this is my son, Dr. Frasier Crane. "
"Kathy: I was just telling your father how much I love your show. You're such a good listener. "
"Frasier: Uh-huh. "
"Kathy: Just yesterday, you gave the best advice to that woman who called in with a problem about her teenage son. What was it you said, exactly? "
"Frasier: Oh, what do I ever say? You're in denial, seek help, whatever, blah, blah, blah. "
"Kathy: He's a little different from what I expected. "
"Martin: Yeah, he's not what I expected either, but you get used to it. "
"Kathy: So, you were telling me about being a detective. "
"Martin: Oh, yeah, yeah, I... say, do you ah, feel like getting a drink? "
"Kathy: Yeah, that'd be nice, Marty. "
"Martin: OK, let's go. "
"Martin: You know, this is such a prime spot here, I think one of us should stay here and one of us should get the drinks. "
"Kathy: You're right. "
"Martin: So, I'll have a beer. "
"Kathy: Oh, shoot, I think I lost an earring. "
"Martin: Oh, oh, there it is, by my foot. [Kathy looks expectantly at him. He flicks the earring to her with his foot.] There you go. "
"Kathy: Thanks. Enjoy the party. "
"TO: Niles and Vickie coming from the buffet. "
"Kathy: These eggrolls are delicious. "
"Niles: I, uh, made them myself. "
"Kathy: Really, a psychiatrist and a chef? Impressive. "
"Niles: Yes, well they both came in handy when I cured the ham. "
"Frasier: Hello Niles. "
"Niles: What do you want? "
"Frasier: Actually, there's something of an emergency in the kitchen. "
"Niles: Oh, that's very cadgy, Frasier. Why don't you just run out and yell 'Fire?' "
"Niles: Dear God. Excuse me, Vickie, for just for a moment. "
"Vickie: Of course. "
"Vickie: Is it a serious problem? "
"Frasier: Oh, no. He's always run like that. Oh, oh you mean the kitchen. No, no, Niles can handle it. "
"Vickie: You two seem very close. "
"Frasier: Oh, yes. I'm his best friend. Well, his only friend really. "
"Vickie: Well that surprises me. He seems very outgoing. "
"Frasier: Doesn't he, though? Yes, the medication seems to be working wonders. Just hope he sticks with it this time. Well, shall we hit the buffet? "
"TO: Roz sitting at one end of the fainting couch and talking "
"Roz: What a great story. "
"Man: Thanks, this is fun. "
"Roz: Yeah. "
"Man: I usually hate these kinds of parties. "
"Roz: Oh, me too. People are always so superficial. "
"Man: Yeah, seems like everybody nowadays is all about appearances. Well, shall we get a drink? "
"Roz: Yeah, sure. "
"Roz: I'm not really very thirsty. "
"Man: Me either. "
"Roz: OK. "
"Man: See ya. "
"Frasier: Then I top it all off with brandied cherries and a dollop of creme fraiche. "
"Niles: Excuse me, Frasier. "
"Frasier: Not now Niles. I'm telling Vickie my recipe for crepes cateau. "
"Niles: Oh, I'm sure she's had enough of your crepes by now. I'm terribly sorry to interrupt, but I believe Dad needs you, Frasier. "
"Frasier: No, he doesn't. "
"Vickie: Oh, I think he might. [Martin is frantically waving at Frasier.] "
"Frasier: All right, then. If you will excuse me. "
"Vickie: Do you live with your father, Niles? "
"Niles: Oh, no. A grown man, live with his father? Frasier lives with Dad. Champagne? "
"Vickie: Oh, yes. "
"TO: Frasier talking to Martin again. Martin has something "
"Frasier: What is it? "
"Martin: You gotta get me home "
"Frasier: Why? "
"Martin: Well, something's happening with my hair dye. It's melting or somethin'. Look at this stain [indicating chair, not his head] It must look terrible. "
"Frasier: No, no it doesn't actually. It looks terrific. "
"Martin: You sure? "
"Frasier: Well, maybe the fire is making you perspire just a little bit. Here. "
"Frasier: Well, actually you look quite young and attractive. You know by the warmth of the fire glow, I'd say that you actually look like you're back in your Marty Party days. "
"Martin: You're not BSing me? "
"Frasier: No, no. "
"Martin: OK, then, I'll stay. "
"Frasier: Great "
"Frasier: Vickie. Hello, where's Niles? "
"Vickie: Oh, he had to take a call. "
"Frasier: Oh, well, that's terrific. Ah, would you be interested in maybe finding some place where we could talk, just the two of us, no interruptions? "
"Roz: Frasier. "
"Frasier: Not now, Roz. "
"Roz: Come here. "
"Frasier: Can't you see I'm busy? "
"Roz: My water just broke "
"Frasier: Well... maybe you sat in something. "
"Niles: Oh my God, what's all over my Turkish prayer rug? "
"Roz: You gotta get me to a hospital. "
"Frasier: Yes, yes, I'm sorry, of course. Vickie, Vickie? If you'll excuse us, my friend Roz just went into labor. "
"Vickie: Oh, how exciting Good luck. "
"Roz: Thanks. "
"Frasier: Oh, wait, wait just one second. Vickie, I know this may not be the most appropriate moment, but I was wondering if perhaps you'd like to have dinner with me sometime. "
"Vickie: Oh, well, that's very sweet of you, Frasier, but I'm not really interested. "
"Frasier: Oh, well, thank you for your honesty. My God What is wrong with me? Why can't I find a single woman who's interested in me? "
"Roz: Those are two different questions, really, so we should just sit down and talk them both over. Oh, wait, I can't - BECAUSE I'M IN LABOR "
"Frasier: How's the coffee, Dad? "
"Martin: Better. This time it's hot and it's got extra cream. Of course, it's still chicken soup. "
"Frasier: Well, who needs coffee when we can keep alert by perusing these very up-to-date magazines? [picks one up] Oh, look, Dad. That cute Tricia Nixon's getting married. "
"Frasier: Oh, excuse me? May we get an update on Roz Doyle? "
"Nurse: Sure. Uh, she is still in early labor. Hang in there. "
"Frasier: Thank you. "
"Martin: She's pretty. I should make a play for her – considering how young and attractive I am tonight "
"Frasier: I said I was sorry Not half as sorry as I was when I went over that speed bump and you left a head print on the ceiling of my BMW. "
"Niles: Ah, hello. "
"Martin: Hi. "
"Frasier: Hello, Niles. Didn't expect to see you here. "
"Niles: Oh, well, the doorman found Roz's purse in the lobby. I thought she might need it. "
"Frasier: I suppose you also came to gloat. You got Vickie, I didn't. "
"Niles: Neither of us got Vickie. She went home with the bartender. "
"Frasier: Really? Well, you know what I say? Her loss. "
"Niles: Absolutely right. Her loss Has saying that ever made you feel any better? "
"Frasier: Not a whit. "
"Martin: It's been a hell of a night for all of us. "
"Niles: Well, it certainly was for me. I lost Vickie, my rug is ruined, someone left weird brown stains on my wing chair... "
"Daphne: Hello. "
"Daphne: Yes, I came down as soon as I heard. [She notices Martin.] What the hell happened to your hair? "
"Martin: Well, what do you think? I colored it, just like you told me to. "
"Daphne: Yeah, but this isn't cinnamon sable. "
"Martin: Well, I couldn't use that, it had a woman's picture on the box. So I used some stuff called 'Color In A Can' instead. It said 'As seen on TV - Just spray on and go.' How did I know it was a lousy product? "
"Frasier: If only there had been some clue "
"Martin: Don't you start on me, mister, you left me melting by that fire. "
"Niles: Wait a minute You're the one who left stains on my wing chair "
"Frasier: I was wondering when you'd crack that, Miss Marple "
"Daphne: Stop it What is wrong with the three of you? Our friend is having a baby in there "
"Niles: I'm sorry, Daphne, we've all had dreadful evenings, but you're absolutely right. We should be thinking of Roz. "
"Daphne: Exactly. Besides, nobody could've had as horrendous an evening as I did. I got stood up. At a bat mitzvah I waited there an hour. Oh, he left some lame excuse on the machine, but if he thinks he's got another chance with me, he's meshugge. "
"Frasier: Oh, boo-hoo, anyway. At least you had a date tonight "
"Niles: Oh, at least your apartment wasn't decimated "
"Martin: I went to a party tonight with shoe polish on my hair "
"Nurse: That's it, breathe. You're doing great. ' 'Hang in there' 'We love you.' As "
"Nurse: She's very tired, so I'll have to ask you to make it quick. "
"Frasier: OK. "
"whispering: "
"Frasier: Roz. Congratulations. "
"Martin: Oh, look at her "
"Niles: Oh, she's beautiful. "
"Daphne: Mazel tov "
"Frasier: It's a long story. "
"Daphne: So, what's her name? "
"Roz: Alice. Alice May Doyle. My daughter. My God, it's the first time I've ever said that. "
"Martin: Well, you look great. How do you feel? "
"Roz: Oh, fine. Just a little tired. "
"Martin: Sure. "
"Daphne: Maybe we should go. "
"Frasier: Right. "
"Daphne: I'll drop by and see you tomorrow, OK? "
"Roz: OK. "
"Martin: You know, I sure would love to hold her for just a second? "
"Frasier: You know, maybe we should just wait until you're not dripping toxins. "
"Martin: Oh. OK, we'll see you, then. "
"Niles: Congratulations. "
"Frasier: I'll be along in a second. "
"Frasier: Oh, Roz. Congratulations again. I'm so proud of you. Your little girl is just perfect. "
"Roz: She is, isn't she? "
"Frasier: Mm-hmm. My God, look at your face. "
"Roz: Oh, yeah, I must look real lovely. "
"Frasier: Yes, that's exactly how you "
"look: lovely. I don't think I've ever seen your face more purely happy than right now. "
"Frasier: Oh, little Alice, how I wish you could wake up right now and see how beautiful your mother looks. [Roz is now dead asleep, head thrown back and snoring.] Then again, you need your rest. "
"Frasier: You did great, honey. [He kisses her on the forehead] Sleep well. Oh, hello. "
"Nurse: Hi. "
"Frasier: This may seem like an odd time to ask you this, but I was convinced that we sort of made some eye contact in the waiting room and I was wondering if I could get your number. "
"Nurse: What about your...? "
"Frasier: Oh, no, forget about her, she's asleep. "
"Nurse: What kind of monster are you? "
"Frasier: Her loss. "

"Frasier: Tricia...I am so very sorry. Have you been waiting long? "
"Tricia: Well, let's "
"see: we were supposed to meet at noon and it's now quarter to one. "
"Frasier: Well, I do apologize, it's just that the most extraordinary thing happened. "
"Tricia: Well, at least I'll get a colorful anecdote out of this. What was it? "
"Frasier: My watch stopped. "
"Tricia: I gotta go. "
"Frasier: No, no, no, no. That really is extraordinary. You see, it's a very fine Swiss timepiece, it only loses a minute per decade. "
"Tricia: And you've had it for what? Four hundred and fifty years? I'm sorry Frasier, I have an appointment at one. "
"Frasier: No, no, no, please, please, let me have another chance. I so enjoyed meeting you last night, I'd love to get to know you better. "
"Tricia: Well, I suppose even Swiss watches sometimes stop. "
"Frasier: You'd be amazed how much fondue gets overcooked that way. Listen, how about lunch tomorrow? I know the maitre d' over at the Le Petite Bistro, he'll give us the best table in the house. Please? "
"Tricia: Well, OK. I'll meet you there at one. That's when the little hand is on the one... "
"Frasier: Yes, yes, I know, I know. See you then. "
"Niles: Frasier. "
"Frasier: Oh, Niles. "
"Niles: Thank god you have room. I just spent ten stupefying minutes sharing a table with a taxidermist. I swear, he doesn't have to stuff his trophies, he can just bore them stiff. Who was that woman? "
"Frasier: Actually, a young woman I met during intermission at the opera last night. I swear, Niles, it was remarkable. Our hands touched, there was a spark. After ten minutes of conversation, I knew I had to know this young woman better. Ever experience that sort of thing? "
"Niles: Actually, yes, I do know a thing or two about the spark of attraction. "
"Frasier: Oh, excuse me, may I have non-fat cappuccino, please? Well, what am I to deduce, that you've recently gotten lucky? "
"Niles: Yes And here's the "
"kicker: she lives in your building. Five floors down, Allison Landis. "
"Frasier: Well, you little sneak. I don't even know the woman. How did you two meet? "
"Niles: Well, we were just chatting on the elevator. I walked her to her car, where it turned out she'd locked her keys inside. My resourcefulness saved the day... "
"Frasier: What'd you do, fish them out with a coat hanger? "
"Niles: No, I called the auto club. Where would I find a coat hanger? Anyway, she invited me to join her for lunch, we hit it off. The next night, I took her to dinner, one thing led to another, and soon, there was no need for words. "
"Frasier: Except for your frantically babbled 'Thank you's.' "
"Niles: Oh, well. I'm seeing her again tonight, so you'll understand if I'm a little bit drained during our squash game. My lovemaking can get slightly athletic. "
"Frasier: Which is more than can be said for your squash game. "
"Niles: It's funny - I've been away from the seduction scene so long I was worried I had started to lose my technique? Were those fears ever groundless. You know, it's like French, you can go without speaking it for years, then just a few hours on the old boulevarde d'amour and you, ah... Where are you going? "
"Frasier: To sit with the taxidermist. "
"Frasier: I can't believe this has happened to me two days in a row "
"Niles: Frasier, you had car trouble, it can happen to anyone. "
"Frasier: I hope she's still sitting at Le Petite Bistro. "
"Daphne: Oh, she isn't. "
"Frasier: What? "
"Daphne: If you're talking about someone named Tricia, she called To say she was leaving the restaurant. She also said you were right about the "
"table: that it was a beautiful table in a prime location, and that she wished you were laid out dead on top of it. "
"Frasier: Oh, God. Ah, it's her machine. Hello, Tricia, it's Frasier. Look, I'm, I'm terribly sorry but it's just my car battery went dead at a light, and I didn't have my cell phone with me. By the time I got a jump I realized I couldn't go directly to the restaurant because I was wearing these ridiculous shorts, and I, I know how this sounds, but it's the truth Here, just ask my brother. "
"Niles: He’s right, they're ridiculous shorts. "
"Frasier: Anyway, please give me one more chance. I'll go anywhere, anytime, just, uh, give me a call. Please. "
"Niles: May I have the phone? "
"Frasier: Of course. God, I had such high hopes for this young woman, now I've gone and blown it twice. Whom are you calling? "
"Niles: Allison. It's been hours since we spoke. Hello, there. How ya feeling? Uh-huh. Me too. Yeah, me too. "
"Frasier: Oh for God's sake, take it in my bedroom You're makin' the dog twitch "
"Martin: Frasier, you're gonna be so excited when you hear what I got planned for your birthday "
"Frasier: Oh, Dad, please, I thought I said I didn't want any fuss this year. "
"Martin: Well, get ready to change your mind, 'cause I scored tickets, Friday night, to the best show in town. [He takes two tickets out of his pocket and holds them up.] "
"Frasier: Chimps on Ice? Oh, my. "
"Martin: Yeah, now I know this doesn't sound like your cup of tea, but trust me on this. Duke saw this last week and he busted a gut. "
"Frasier: Well, Dad... "
"Martin: And mind you, he even saw it with the understudy. "
"Frasier: Dad, look, you know, I really don't feel like going out on my birthday this year. "
"Martin: Oh, are you sure? "
"Frasier: Yes, I actually had made plans already. I was gonna stay in and watch television. The opera is mounting a new production of 'Cosi van Tutti.' "
"Martin: Oh, well no wonder then. OK, but you're missing a real treat. Duke said in the finalé, the whole cast skates to the top of this ramp, then Splat right into a tank of whipped cream. Bet they don't do that at your opera. "
"Frasier: No. And Mozart's still kicking himself. "
"Martin: Come on, boy. "
"Niles: Frasier? Are you familiar with the Safari Club? "
"Frasier: Of course I'm familiar with them. Their yearly expeditions are remarkable. "
"Niles: They're more than remarkable They're the stuff of legend. Last year, they made camp at the base of Mount Everest, then had their servants climb it while they held a wine tasting. "
"Frasier: So why are you telling me this? "
"Niles: Because, Allison is a member. This Friday night, they're having a black tie reception at her place downstairs, and we're invited "
"Frasier: That's incredible Oh my goodness "
"Niles: Consider it your birthday present. "
"Frasier: Oh, thank you Thank you so much. But wait, gee, I told Dad I was gonna stay home that night. You mustn't tell him about this. "
"Niles: Oh, don't worry. He'll never suspect. I told him yesterday I was going to be away for the weekend. "
"Frasier: Great. Perfect. But wait a "
"minute: you knew about this yesterday? "
"Niles: Uh, no. But I knew about Chimps on Ice. "
"Niles: I am so looking forward to this. I understand one of the members is going to show an old film he made of the rare and endangered species found only in the rain forest. Maris would have loved it. "
"Frasier: Oh, why so? "
"Niles: She had shoes made from almost all of them. "
"Niles: Allison. "
"Allison: Niles. And this must be Frasier. "
"Frasier: Hello. "
"Allison: Come in, both of you. There are lots of people I'd like you to meet. "
"TO: the interior of her apartment. A lavish banquet is set "
"Allison: The bar is over there, and the hors d'oeuvres are over here. We have some fascinating delicacies actually bagged by our own members. This is ostrich, that's wildebeest, and that's springbok. "
"Frasier: You know, I can never remember which... Is it 'Fall ahead, Springbok' or vice versa? [They laugh, Frasier's cell phone starts ringing.] Oh, oh good heavens, I forgot I had this on me. "
"Allison: Don't apologize. I do it myself. Even in the veldt, one must keep in touch with one's broker. Here, you can have privacy in the study. "
"Frasier: Thank you. Hello? "
"Niles: You look ravishing. "
"Allison: Thank you, but listen, I think you and I should be very discreet tonight. "
"Niles: Oh, I'm a psychiatrist. If I can't be discreet, it don't rain in Tanganyika. "
"Allison: Good. After all, if in the near future you should happen to be up for membership in our little club, I want to appear completely objective when I sing your praises. "
"Niles: My ears are already burning. "
"Niles: Frasier We're being considered for membership. Allison as much as said it. We must do everything in our power to show them how enthusiastic we are. "
"Frasier: I have to leave. "
"Niles: What? "
"Frasier: Niles, that was Tricia on the phone. She's going out of town tonight for a month. But if I swing by, pick her up at her place, pick her up, we can at least join each other for a drink. "
"Niles: Are you insane? This is the Safari Club. These are the people who introduced badminton to Devil's Island. "
"Frasier: I don't care It was kismet when I met this young woman, I'm not giving up an opportunity to see her "
"Niles: But, to leave two minutes after you arrived, you're going to ruin both our chances "
"Frasier: All right, I'll make a proper excuse. Excuse me, Allison? I'm terribly sorry, it seems I'm coming down with a touch of something, I'm going to have to leave. "
"Allison: You poor man. If you feel better, please do come back down. We'll be here all evening. "
"Frasier: Thank you, but I, I don't really see that there's much hope. "
"TO: the hallway outside Frasier's apartment. "
"Frasier: Yes, I'm just stopping by my place to pick up my keys, I will see you in ten minutes. And Tricia? I can't wait. OK, bye. "
"Crowd: Surprise "
"Martin: You didn't think we were gonna let you stay home alone on your birthday, did ya? Look at his face He can't believe it. "
"Frasier: No, I certainly can't. "
"Daphne: Well, why are you dressed like that? "
"Frasier: Well, I, I dress like this sometimes when I watch the opera on television. "
"Bulldog: Well, that's up there on the dork meter. "
"Frasier: You know, since I'm not going to be watching the opera, perhaps I could run out and buy a brand new videotape so I can record it. "
"Daphne: We're way ahead of you, Dr. Crane, your father has the VCR all set up. "
"Bulldog: Let's get things started Here you go, Doc. Happy birthday. "
"Frasier: Oh, well, thank you Bulldog, thank you all. Oh, well, “David Copperfield,” Dickens's classic tale of a young man making his way in the world. "
"Bulldog: I, uh, think we're talking about different movies, here, Doc. "
"Frasier: Mmm. 'David Cop-a-Feel.' Well... "
"Bulldog: But you were right about the classy tail part. Hey, you need a brew? I'm headed that way. "
"Frasier: No, no thanks. "
"Roz: I'd love a cup of hot tea with lemon. "
"Bulldog: Hey, I'm fetching, not cooking. "
"Daphne: It's OK, Roz. There's a kettle of boiling water on the stove. Here you are. "
"Frasier: Yes, well, thank you, Daphne. "
"Daphne: Now don't be mad with your father. He just wanted to do something nice for your birthday, after you turned thumbs down on the skating monkeys. "
"Martin: Hey, great party huh? Just as long as we've got enough ice. You got four bags, right? "
"Daphne: No, I got two. "
"Martin: Two? I told you to get four bags "
"Daphne: Oh, here we go. "
"Martin: You never under-budget on the ice. You never know, you might get a lot more rocks drinkers than you expected. Or ice chewers. "
"Frasier: Dad, I can go get some more ice "
"Daphne: We don't need more ice We've got plenty. There's a whole tub of it. "
"Frasier: Yes, well, then, excuse me. I need to make a call. "
"Frasier: Tricia, Frasier. Look, I've been detained. Yes, I know you really don't want to know why. Say, you know what? I think I can find a way to get out of here. Yes, I'll see you in a few minutes. "
"Frasier: Dad. Bad news, seems your ice is melting awfully fast. "
"Martin: What? "
"Frasier: No worries, I'll get some more. "
"Roz: No, Frasier, it's your party, I'll go. "
"Frasier: No, Roz, I want to go. "
"Roz: But you just got here. "
"Frasier: Roz, it's my birthday, I can do whatever I want on my birthday, I want to go get some ice. "
"Martin: I knew it I warned her It's practically gone "
"Frasier: Don't worry, Dad I'm on it "
"Roz: Listen, I'll be glad to go... "
"Frasier: Roz, I want to go, I know what kind Dad likes "
"Frasier: No, no, don't stop on fourteen. Just don't stop on fourteen. No, no "
"Allison: Frasier I'm delighted you're feeling better. You're just in time, we're about to start the film. Wait 'til you see it. Just grab a chair before all the good seats are gone. "
"Niles: What are you doing here? "
"Frasier: Wishing I had taken the stairs. "
"Karl: If I wanted this martini shaken, I'd have asked the bartender to do it. "
"Nigel: Mustn't mind old Rhino, always in a vile mood. "
"Frasier: “Rhino?” "
"Nigel: Karl Landis, Allison's husband. They call him 'Rhino' because of his mean temper. "
"Niles: Husband? Allison's m-married? "
"Nigel: Not surprised people don't know. Man's always on safari. Loves guns. Guns and women. No secret, notorious for it. Cheats on her constantly. Mark my words, one of these days she'll pay him back and then rub his bloodthirsty nose in it. "
"Niles: Here's something "
"interesting: I think I just swallowed my tongue. "
"Frasier: Niles, Niles, just be calm, be calm. What's done is done. You didn't know, and now it's over. As long as you've both been discreet, there's no reason it should ever get back to Rhino. "
"room: "
"Karl: I don't know what you're insinuating. "
"Allison: Well, don't lie. Everyone knows what goes on in that pup tent. Well, I can play at that game too. In fact, I already have, and with somebody right here tonight. How do you like that? "
"corner: "
"Niles: Frasier, I have to ask a small favor. I need you to create a distraction, while I have a sex change and move to Europe. "
"Frasier: I'm sorry, Niles, I would love to stay and help, but I've got to get out of here myself. "
"Allison: Well, we're ready for the movie. Mind helping me turn out the lights? "
"Frasier: Splendid idea You're going to want it nice and dark in here, aren't you? "
"Niles: You should have told me you were married. I have to leave. "
"Allison: Don't be a fool. If he sees someone sneaking out of here, that's the first person he'll suspect. "
"Frasier: All set, and it's show time. "
"Niles: What happened? "
"Allison: Did someone pull the plug out? "
"Frasier: Yep. Here it is All right, lights out. There you go. "
"Karl: What was that? "
"Niles: Well, someone certainly snuck out of here in a hurry. "
"Karl: I know what you're all thinking. Now that Allison has seen fit to air our dirty laundry in public, you assume that was her lover. But I know it wasn't. "
"Niles: How? "
"Karl: Because I can sense that he's still here. In the jungle, I learned to smell fear, and I smell it now. "
"Karl: So, let's see if the swine has the guts to stand up and admit it before I expose him. What about it, coward? Going to stand up? "
"Karl: That many? My God, woman, you're as bad as I am. Come on, ya bastards, join me in a drink. "
"TO: "
"Noel: Hi, Dr. Crane. We're all just on our way up to your place. "
"Frasier: Noel. So you are. Hi Tom, Janet, Bill. You know what? I was just heading down, we're out of ice. "
"Noel: Oh, not anymore. I brought a twenty-pound bag. Just call me Noel Shempsky, Party Saver. "
"TO: Frasier's apartment. Everyone is playing charades as "
"Roz: Time "
"Frasier: Here's the ice Here, Noel, put that in the kitchen, will you? "
"Noel: Sure. "
"Frasier: Come on in, everybody. You know, Dad, I've done the silliest thing. I went out without my wallet. They gave me the ice, but I have to go back and pay them. "
"Roz: No, at least stay and play the last round of charades with us. "
"Frasier: Actually, I should be getting back there... "
"Daphne: You love charades. "
"Martin: Charades. "
"Daphne: Shut up. Anyway, it's not going to kill them, to wait a few minutes for their money. "
"Bulldog: Come on, be on our team. We really suck at this game. "
"Roz: Noel, you're on our team. The category is famous play titles. "
"Noel: I'm a bear at charades. "
"Martin: Ready? All right, go "
"Daphne: Three words. "
"Daphne: Morning. "
"Noel: Morning Becomes Electra "
"Roz: Yes "
"Bulldog: What? "
"Martin: Four seconds? "
"Frasier: Well, well done Roz Nice playing with you, I'm out of here. "
"Roz: Hey, wait a minute. You've got to take a turn. "
"Frasier: What, really? "
"Roz: You've got thirty seconds to prepare. "
"Frasier: Oh, all right. Maybe I'll just...prepare in the kitchen Tricia You know, you're going to laugh when you hear this. Hello? Tricia? Oh, fine. [He reads the slip of paper.] Ha, ha, 'The Iceman Cometh' "
"TO: the living room. "
"Frasier: All right. "
"Roz: Ready? OK, go. "
"Martin: Three words. First word, small word, arm, in, of, to, be. "
"Bulldog: It, it, I, you, me. "
"Martin: They, them, us, we, he, she. "
"Bulldog: Ok, forget about it. Second word, two syllables. First syllable cold, chilly, freezing, winter,. "
"Martin: Snow, sleet hail, frost, frostbite, gangrene. "
"Frasier: Gangrene? "
"Roz: No talking allowed. "
"Bulldog: Second syllable. Shrink. Doctor. Dork. "
"Martin: Person, guy, male, man. "
"Bulldog: Let's see, icy cold man...iceman...got it "
"Frasier: Thank you "
"Bulldog: Frosty the Snowman "
"Frasier: No, you jackass The Iceman Cometh "
"Roz: Disqualified. "
"Frasier: You two are the worst charades players I've ever seen in my entire life My God, those skating chimps could... Well, you did your best, we'll get it next time. Off I go... "
"Roz: No, wait, wait, wait Frasier, we still have one little consolation prize for you. "
"All: Happy Birthday to you, happy birthday to you. "
"Daphne: Look, he's crying "
"All: Happy birthday dear Frasier, happy birthday to you. "
"Frasier: Made it "
"Tricia: Boy, are you wrong. "
"Frasier: Oh, Tricia, please... "
"Tricia: Save it, Frasier. I have a plane leaving for Spokane in An hour, my cab is on its way, so why don't you just be on your way, too? "
"Frasier: Would it make any difference if I told you I had to sneak out of a birthday party being given for me by my own father just to be here with you? "
"Tricia: Yeah, right. It's your birthday. "
"Frasier: Look, if you don't believe me, here, just see for yourself. In fact, it's turning out to be the worst birthday party I've had since I was eight, when I pinned the tail on Sally Anunsiato. She shoved a cupcake down my shorts. "
"Tricia: Wow, you really blew off your own birthday party just to come meet me. "
"Frasier: I would have done almost anything to get to know you better. "
"Tricia: Well, that's very sweet, Frasier, and I wish I had more time, but I have an 8 AM appointment in Spokane, and I can't miss my plane. "
"Frasier: Well, I could drive you. "
"Tricia: But it's only twenty minutes to the airport, it's hardly worth it. "
"Frasier: I wasn't talking about the airport. "
"Tricia: What? "
"Frasier: I could have you in Spokane in six hours. That'll certainly give us enough time to get acquainted. "
"Tricia: Oh, no, I can't ask you to do that. "
"Frasier: But you didn't ask. I offered. Look, I want to do it, here. "
"Tricia: That's the most romantic thing I've ever heard. "
"Frasier: Well, the way I see it, one of two things can happen. Either we'll discover that we've foolishly built each other up in our own imaginations because we've had so much trouble getting together; or, this could end up being a story we tell our grandchildren. Personally, I can't wait to find out which. "
"Tricia: Me either. "
"Frasier: Well, off we go. "
"TO: the interior of the car as they head down the road. "
"Tricia: I thought I'd find us a little background music. "
"Frasier: Good idea. Looking for some more opera? "
"Tricia: Heck, no. The one the other night was my first and last. I was dragged to it by one of my converts. [She stops on a country-western station.] There we go. "
"Frasier: Converts, you say? "
"Tricia: Mm-hmm. I'm one of the Truth bringers. I was ordained by Brother Carmichael himself, the evangelist? I go door to door, spreading his word. Listen, do you mind my asking something? Have you heard the Truth? "
"Frasier: Something tells me I'm about to. "
"TO: the road, Frasier's car heading away to the strains of "

"Frasier: Well, that's it for today, Seattle. This is Dr. Frasier Crane wishing you good day and good mental health. "
"Bulldog: All right, move it. We're stood waiting for the booth here. "
"Frasier: That is not amusing when you do it in the men's room, it's not amusing now "
"Gil: All ready then, Bulldog? "
"Roz: What are you two doing? "
"Bulldog: We're recording an ad for a new sponsor. We've only got a minute here so scram both of ya Oh, by the way, Roz, baby or no baby, your ass has never looked better. "
"Roz: Shut up "
"Roz: How sick is that? "
"Frasier: Oh, he's just being Bulldog. "
"Roz: Not that I didn't like hearing it. "
"Bulldog: Hi, I'm Bulldog Briscoe. "
"Gil: And I'm Gil Chesterton. When Bulldog and I are out on the town together... "
"Bulldog: Whether it's opening night at the opera... "
"Gil: Or rooting our Mariners to victory... "
"Bulldog: We always round of the evening in the same "
"way: With a nice relaxing cup of 'Happy Dreams' tea. "
"Gil: Mmmm. "
"Bulldog: We're making some right now. How many lumps do you like, Gil? "
"Gil: One, please. "
"Gil: Ouch Gets me every time. "
"Bulldog: 'Happy Dreams' tea, one cup, you'll have happy dreams the whole night through. Yes, perfect One thing? "
"Gil: Well, my ouch could be a bit more convincing. "
"Bulldog: We'll splice that in later. "
"Frasier: What the hell was that? "
"Roz: The new station manager's idea. They're getting some of the on-air talent to record commercials for the new sponsors. You're not disappointed he didn't ask you to do it, are you? "
"Frasier: Oh yes Roz, about as disappointed as I was when that hypnotist at the Christmas party picked them to come up on stage and groom each other like monkeys. "
"Roz: Oh yeah, you were really left out at that party He didn't make you do anything silly. No, sir "
"Frasier: Roz "
"Roz: Oh Daphne, what are you doing here? "
"Frasier: Hi, Daph. "
"Daphne: Dr. Crane's car's in the shop so I'm the chauffeur for the day. It may take a while to get home, there's a rally on Pike Street holding up the traffic. "
"Frasier: Oh, what sort of rally? "
"Daphne: Apparently they're trying to save some old bookstore from being torn down. "
"Frasier: Not 'Hirsh & Sons'? "
"Daphne: Yes, that's the one. Some developer wants to build a strip mall there. "
"Frasier: They can't do that That's a Seattle landmark. My God, Mark Twain gave a reading there. "
"Roz: Oh yeah, I know that place. I used to have a boyfriend who liked to make out in the occult section. "
"Frasier: Frankly, I'm terribly upset about this. You know, I think we'll go down there and join that rally. "
"Roz: Good for you, Frasier. "
"Fraiser: I refuse to stand idly by whilst some fat cat bully rides roughshod over the little people. "
"Daphne: I don't want to go to a rally. "
"Frasier: Tough luck You're the chauffeur "
"Daphne: This is actually rather exciting. I must say, I never thought you to be the protest type. "
"Frasier: Oh, on the contrary, Daphne. I was quite the activist in my college days. There's nothing like throwing your feel as bad to scruffy young rebels thumbing their noses at convention. "
"Daphne: So, did you go into the whole package then? Long hair, bell bottom jeans? "
"Frasier: Oh heavens no, though I did have a pair of psychedelic suspenders that raised an eyebrow or two. This seat looks good, don't you think? "
"Daphne: Yeah. "
"Leader: Hey this is great, look everybody, it's Dr. Frasier Crane from the radio. Dr. Crane, would you like to say a few words? "
"Frasier: Well, all right. Well, I'll keep it simple. Be strong, people. Our cause is just. To the barricades [they cheer him and he sits] This is sort of fun, isn't it? "
"Daphne: Yes. "
"Cop: People, this is your final warning. "
"Frasier: Who do you suppose that is? "
"Daphne: The police, I think. "
"Cop: Disperse now or we will take action. "
"Frasier: What do you suppose they mean by that? "
"Leader: We're not going anywhere, are we? [all except Frasier shout no] "
"Frasier: You don't think they're talking about a jail sort of thing here, do you? "
"Daphne: Who knows? Exciting, isn't it? "
"Leader: They're going to have to drag us out of here, aren't they? "
"Frasier: They don't actually drag people away anymore, do they? "
"Leader: They're too afraid to arrest us, aren't they? [all bar Frasier shout 'Yeah'] "
"Frasier: Well, now you're just provoking them. "
"Cop: Alright people, you had your warning. "
"Frasier: They weren't kidding. Well, there goes the first lucky martyrs to our cause. Well, as they are dragging people away there'll be none left to protest, you know I better go get some reinforcement. "
"Daphne: Dr. Crane, Dr. Crane Where are you going? "
"Frasier: Solidarity, my brothers [runs off to Daphne's shouts as she is arrested too] "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Hello, Niles. "
"Niles: Frasier, I hope you're free tonight. I just secured a table at the most exclusive new restaurant in Seattle. "
"Frasier: I'm sorry - just not in the mood. "
"Niles: At least hear me out - this place is the hottest new thing in fusion cuisine. "
"Frasier: What cuisines are being fused? "
"Niles: Polynesian and Scandanavian. It's called 'Mahole-Valhalla.' "
"Frasier: Well, perhaps there's a reason why God put those two countries so far apart. "
"Niles: I had my doubts too. But my gourmet newsletter gave three- and-a-half whisks to their coconut herring. "
"Frasier: I'm sorry, Niles. It's just a bad night. See, Daphne's been hauled down to jail. Dad's down there trying to bail her out. "
"Niles: What? "
"Frasier: Don't worry, they should be home any minute, it's just that she was down at that rally for 'Hirsh & Sons' book store. The worst part of it is that I convinced her to go and when they started hauling people away I chickened out and ran. "
"Niles: You left her there? "
"Frasier: It was a thoroughly shameful performance. Though I did clear that private hedge in front of Emerson's funeral home like a Kentucky show horse. What has happened to me, Niles? I used to be so courageous. To fight for things. When did I become so middle-aged? So timid? "
"Niles: Don't be so hard on yourself, it's part of life. We all get a bit more cautious as we get older. "
"Frasier: Not me God, it was only five years ago I packed up my whole life in Boston, moved across the country to start over. That took real courage. Now, ha-ha, the biggest risk I take is saying to Dad, 'Hey, let's go out to dinner, you pick the restaurant'. "
"Frasier: Daphne Daphne, it's so good to have you home safe and sound. "
"Daphne: Sod off "
"Martin: She's a little mad at you. "
"Frasier: Yes, thank you Dad. Daphne, I am so sorry, I feel just terrible. "
"Daphne: As you should You left me handcuffed and helpless. "
"Niles: If you ever find yourself in that position again, be sure to call on me. For help "
"Daphne: Thank you, Dr. Crane. Shame on you, Dr. Crane, why can't you be more like Dr. Crane? "
"Martin: I can't believe it took me six hours to get her out. In my day cops could count on a few perks. No speeding tickets, get your friends out of jail fast... It's all gone to hell "
"Frasier: Yes well, let's hope they never do away with that old 'All jewelry up for grabs at the morgue' policy. "
"Niles: Well, there's no way I'm letting this dinner reservation go to waste. Frasier, last chance? "
"Frasier: Thanks anyway, Niles. "
"Niles: Very well. Hey Dad, what about you? "
"Martin: Yeah, you know Niles, maybe I will come get a bite with you. Sitting around six hours in that station house, I could eat anything. "
"Niles: Let's go, then. "
"Martin: Oh good, I can't wait. Where are we going anyway? [opens front door] "
"Niles: Oh, well... "
"Frasier: Hello, yes, I'd like to order a large pizza. What toppings? Er, just a second. Dad, what do you want on your pizza? "
"Martin: Pepperoni. "
"Frasier: Pepperoni, please. "
"TO: "
"Patrick: Anyway, we've been fighting a lot and she's never in the mood for sex anymore. I think she must be having an affair. "
"Frasier: Now, now, Patrick, let's not give in to paranoia. Just because your wife is avoiding sex lately it doesn't mean she's being unfaithful. You said yourself she hasn't been talking lately. Why don't you try reopening the lines of communication tonight by surprising her with a nice romantic dinner? "
"Patrick: Tonight's no good, she's working late on her boss's boat again. But tomorrow's okay, thanks, Dr. Crane. "
"Frasier: You know, Roz, what do you say we turn things over to our Eye in the Sky, Chopper Dave, with the traffic report? [presses button] "
"Roz: Frasier, I want to introduce you to someone. This is our new station manager, Kenny Daly. "
"Frasier: It's a pleasure. "
"Kenny: Oh, no, no, it's my pleasure. I'm just a - whoa - huge fan. I only had this reaction once before. Did you ever hear of Norman Mailer? "
"Frasier: Of course, the author. "
"Kenny: Oh, no, no, I'm talking about the drive-time guy, worked out of Tampa. 'Norman In The Mornin.'' So funny you pray for traffic. "
"Frasier: Well, I'll try to catch him next time I'm in Tampa. In the mornin'. "
"Kenny: Oh well, I gotta run. It's been great meeting you. "
"Frasier: You, too. "
"Kenny: Oh, I almost forgot. I got a call from the 'Happy Dreams' tea people. They had a bunch of spots scheduled for the first hour and you forgot to read them. "
"Frasier: Actually, I didn't forget. I had a look at the copy, and, well, I couldn't read it. "
"Kenny: Oh, why not? "
"Frasier: Well, just listen to this here. One cup of 'Happy Dreams' tea and you'll have happy dreams all night long. The fact is that dreams are a bi-product of unresolved emotion. No tea can promise happy dreams. "
"Kenny: Oh yeah, I totally get it. Here's my problem - our ad revenues are down and they're a major new sponsor. I just promised them that you'd read the ads this hour. "
"Frasier: Yes, but as a psychiatrist I can't. They're promising something that's impossible. "
"Kenny: Okay, okay, now I understand. What if we just think of it more as a slogan? "
"Frasier: You see, but it's not a slogan. If I as a doctor read it, it sounds like medical advice. "
"Kenny: Okay, now - totally get you. So, instead of saying 'This is Dr. Frasier Crane,' just don't say doctor. "
"Frasier: Kenny, maybe I'm not making myself clear here. Let's try this - I will never read this copy. "
"Kenny: Oh, this is the part of my job I really hate. If you take a stand like that - and I totally respect it, by the way - you force my hand. That's our biggest sponsor. So unless you're willing to go on the air right now and read that ad, I have to fire you. "
"Roz: "
"Frasier: Well, I didn't realize you felt so strongly about it. I guess I have no choice. "
"Kenny: Oh, thanks, Dr. Crane. Oh, what a relief [exits into Roz;s booth] "
"Frasier: Hello Seattle, the people who know me best will not be surprised by what I'm about to tell "
"you: I am not a man who betrays his principles. I am not a man who misleads his listeners and I am not a man who will shrink from a fight. Today I find myself in a fight over the content of my show. But rather than truffle to the forces of commercialism, I've decided to take a stand on principal, even if it means... I'm not on the air, am I? "
"Roz: No. He put on 'The Best of Crane.' "
"Frasier: How much did I get out? "
"Roz: Well, let's see. "
"Frasier: People who know me best will not be surprised by what I'm about to tell "
"you: I am not a man. "
"Frasier: Perfect. "
"Time: 11"
":35) "
"Niles: So they actually fired you? "
"Frasier: Yes. I must say it feels good to take a stand like this. I feel like my old self again. I tell ya' one thing - I don't envy Kenny. Feeling the cold stares of the other employees because he's fired the station's most popular personality. "
"Niles: He fired Tooty, the story lady, too? "
"Frasier: Very funny, Niles. God, who'd have thought that getting fired can make one feel so alive? "
"Frasier: What do you want? Another staring contest, I suppose. Well, you picked the wrong day for that, boyo. "
"Frasier: Take that "
"Martin: Frasier, what are you doing home? "
"Frasier: Well, Dad, brace yourself. The station fired me, so you'll be seeing me this time everyday. "
"Martin: Oh no, that's terrible. "
"Frasier: I assume you mean the firing part. "
"Martin: Well, yeah... What happened? "
"Frasier: Well, they simply asked me to violate a principal I believe in, and I refused. "
"Martin: Well, then I'm proud of you. What did they want you to do? "
"Frasier: Well, there's this product called 'Happy Dreams' tea. They wanted me to say that it gives people happy dreams. "
"Martin: And? "
"Frasier: Well, that's it. I couldn't make a claim like that. "
"Martin: Well, every commercial makes promises they can't deliver. That's what makes it a commercial. "
"Frasier: Yes, Dad, that may be... "
"Martin: It's like that cologne that's supposed to drive women wild. I've used it all my life and I've never had a single strange woman come on to me. Except for that year I worked in Vice. "
"Frasier: Yes, I understand. "
"Martin: But that wasn't about cologne, let me tell ya. "
"Frasier: Yes, I understand. "
"Martin: They were hookers. "
"Frasier: I realize that "
"Niles: Frasier, don't be angry with me but I do have one theory. "
"Frasier: Yes, Niles, I was wondering when you'd get around to that. So, just allow me. I was so ashamed of my chickening out at the rally that I grabbed at the first fight that came my way. Of course it turned out to be the wrong fight and I needlessly lost my job. So, if you follow that theory through to this end - this petty feeling of euphoria I'm experiencing right now is frankly nothing more than a deep- seated denial. "
"Niles: So, have you considered it? "
"Frasier: Not for a second "
"Frasier: Hello. "
"Kenny: Look, I know I must be the last person you want to see right now, but please listen. Since I fired you I haven't been able to eat or sleep. "
"Frasier: Kenny, it's only been and hour and a half. "
"Kenny: Well, I'm a napper. I just came to tell you I was wrong. All I've been able to think about was 'I just fired a man who was willing to go to the mat for the principles.' What does that say about my principles? Before I go on - have you had any job offers? "
"Martin: He's had four. "
"Niles: Dad, shut up. "
"Martin: He's had... "
"Niles: Shut up. "
"Frasier: Technically, I'm still available. "
"Kenny: Well, I'd like you to think about coming back to work tomorrow because the first thing in the morning I'm calling the 'Happy Dreams' people and telling them you're uncomfortable with their ads. At KACL, the talent comes first. "
"Frasier: Well, what can I say but, see you tomorrow. "
"Kenny: This is so great. I'm so relieved. You know what, can I buy you a beer just to show we have no hard feelings? "
"Frasier: I would love that, as long as I don't have to endorse it afterwards. "
"Kenny: Zing, I guess I had that one coming. Nice meeting you. "
"Niles: Bye. "
"Martin: See ya. "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Good afternoon Seattle, this is Dr. Frasier Crane and I would like to begin today by apologizing for my abrupt departure from the airwaves yesterday. You see, I was embroiled in a conflict with the management. I'm happy to report that it's been resolved. Thank you to the efforts of our new station manager, a courageous and principled young man, Ken Daly. I won't bore you with all the details but suffice it to say he took on the big guys and won. "
"Frasier: Anyway, I apologize for our brief interruption yesterday and I assure you... That today's will be even briefer. Roz, let's go to commercial. [opens door and pulls Kenny into booth] Kenny, Kenny, what's going on? "
"Kenny: Actually, it's the darndest thing. I got fired. "
"Frasier: What? How did that happen? "
"Kenny: Well, I told the sponsors you wouldn't read their ads. The next thing I know I'm getting called into Mr. Martin's office in the Black Tower. I told him that sponsors are easier to replace than talent. He said I was easier to replace than anybody. Then he called me a pinhead and took my coke away. "
"Roz: That's terrible. "
"Frasier: Oh, Kenny, I can't help feeling that this is all my fault. "
"Kenny: Oh, no, no, these things happen. And if I've got to get fired sticking up for someone, I'm just honored it was for you. At least now I'll have time to finish the nursery in our new house. We're expecting. Oh, there's my wife now. She's going to get a kick out of this coincidence. Me and her getting fired in the same week. May I? "
"Frasier: Of course. Well, we have got to get Kenny's job back. "
"Roz: Well, how are we supposed to do that? "
"Frasier: Well, we'll just round up all the talent, go down to Mr. Martin and demand that he re-hire Kenny. "
"Roz: Mr. Martin owns the station. We can't give him an ultimatum. "
"Frasier: It's not an ultimatum, Roz, we'll simply appeal to the man's sense of decency. You know Kenny went to bat for me, we owe him at least that. "
"Roz: You know, Kenny hasn't asked for our help, for all we know he'll be fine. "
"Kenny: How do you like that? She's having twins Heck of a time to loose my insurance, huh? Well, you guys take care. "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Now together, I know that we can do this. The most important thing is to present a united front. "
"Frasier: Well, what is the matter with you people? "
"Gil: Isn't it obvious? We're frightened. "
"Frasier: Of what? "
"Roz: Of everything. We're in a building called the Black Tower; those guards in the lobby must have been seven feet tall; and that metal detector thing we had to go through was really scary. "
"Bulldog: It's even scarier finding out that Gil wears an anklet. "
"Frasier: Alright, that's enough Get out of the elevator all, of you. Because I'm ashamed of you, intimidated by a building. We're here for Kenny - the man who wants to start KACL daycare, Roz; the man who approved the extra airbrushing charges on your new publicity photos, Gil. And you Tooty, who was it that just doubled the story-time puppet budget? "
"Tooty: I know, Kenny's a great guy, but I met Joe Martin once. He was a very scary man with eyes as cold as a winter's day... "
"Frasier: Oh all right, Tooty "
"Frasier: Mr. Martin, hello. "
"Joe: Do you have an appointment? "
"Frasier: Mr. Martin, my name is Dr. Frasier Crane and I'm here with some of the other talent from KACL - my producer, Roz Doyle; Gil Chesterton, food critic; Bob Briscoe, sports; Tooty Finegould, the story lady; Ray Schmit, the Greengrocer and Miss Judy, arts and crafts - I'm sorry, Judy, I don't know your last name. "
"Joe: I don't have time for this, I'm in the middle of a board meeting. Please. "
"Frasier: This will only take a moment, Mr. Martin. This morning you fired Kenny Daly, a wonderful station manager and a man of integrity. That is a very rare quality in this industry, I promise you. You fire all the Kenny Dalys, what are you left with? A bunch of sycophants and 'yes' men. Am I right? "
"All: Yes, you're right. "
"Frasier: Now, it would be a great risk to hire Kenny back, but I'm here to tell you that the man who stops taking risks in life pays a very dear price indeed. I know whereof I speak. I can see that I'm getting through to you, so let me just leave you with one last "
"question: what kind of radio station do you want? "
"Joe: You know, Dr. Crane, that is the exact question I've been asking myself all through that board meeting. As you know, our ratings are down and the number crunchers in there think they can fix this thing by sucking up to our sponsors. He- he, well that's not what I think "
"Frasier: Bravo "
"Joe: Thanks to you, I'm going with my gut on this one. "
"Frasier: You bet you are "
"Joe: I'm going to march right in there and tell them that we're doing it my way. No more talk "
"Frasier: Exactly, action "
"Joe: No, no more talk radio. From this moment on, the station is all Latina music, all the time. "
"Frasier: I beg your pardon? "
"Joe: Thank you, Dr. Crane, I'm going back to my roots. I may have walked out of that meeting Joe Martin, corporate sellout. But I'm walking back in José Martinez, risk-taker. "
"Frasier: What the hell just happened? "
"Roz: You just got us all fired "

"Frasier: Before we begin, I'd like to say how honoured I am to be taking over this slot. Obviously, I have some rather big shoes to fill - my predecessor here was much beloved. But I have never been one to shrink from a challenge and I'm sure we'll enjoy many happy years here together in my new home. Now, today on 'Medical Minute'... "
"Frasier: We're going to be tackling the sticky subject of... "
"Director: Dr. Crane, great audition. "
"Frasier: Really? That's all you need? "
"Director: I think we have a good idea what you're all about. "
"Frasier: Excellent. "
"Director: Er, we'll be in touch. "
"Frasier: I'm sure you will. "
"Director: Next, please "
"Frasier: Oh, formalities? Yes, I understand. You know, perhaps I'll just take a walk around the station. Check out the dressing rooms, introduce myself to a few people. Say, you know, is there a sign-up list for the softball team? I'm sure that Frasier 'Slugger' Crane's gonna be an asset to this station in more ways than one "
"Martin: Morning, Frasier. "
"Frasier: Oh, good morning, Dad. "
"Martin: A little early for the piano, isn't it? "
"Frasier: Yes, I'm sorry about that. You know I woke up this morning thinking about that operetta I've been writing. You know, the one about Robert and Elizabeth Browning. I think, well, I had to get right to it. "
"Martin: Well, that's what you get living in a big "
"city: If it's not the horns waking you up it's someone writing an operetta about the Brownings. "
"Frasier: Well, you know, I'm pretty sure I've solved the problem. "
"Martin: Good for you, Frasier. "
"Frasier: But you know, I'd have to hear it to be sure. "
"Martin: I'll bet that. "
"Frasier: Oh come on, Dad, it'll only take a minute, I just want to do this one section. "
"Martin: Oh, all right, but I'm not doing the accent "
"Frasier: Come on. All right, we'll take it right here. "
"Martin: Fine. "

"Frasier: Reveeeall. Take me in your arms... "
"Frasier: Well, I'll just have to sing it with Niles later. "
"Martin: Oh, that'll cheer me up. "
"Frasier: Dad, be careful with those sketches. "
"Martin: Sketches? "
"Frasier: Yes well, you know I've been telling you that I'm redecorating the apartment, I thought why not just design my own furniture? "
"Martin: Boy, Frasier, you know you've been taking on a lot of big projects lately. "
"Frasier: Yes well, any minute now that phone will ring with another job offer, and this blessed little hiatus will be over. I want to have achieved as many of my life's ambitions as possible. Gee, frankly Dad, you should take up a project or two. "
"Martin: Me? What are you talking about? I'm doing stuff all the time. Why, just this weekend I taught Eddie a great new trick. "
"Frasier: Really? "
"Martin: Yeah, come on, I'll show you. [Walks over to Eddie by chair. Eddie jumps down, Martin kneels] "
"Martin: It starts out that I point a gun at him. "
"Frasier: I like it so far. "
"Martin: Then I say 'Freeze punk, it's all over.' "
"Martin: It's all over Oh come on Eddie, you're supposed to go like this. "
"Frasier: Now all we have to do is teach Eddie to say 'It's all over.' "
"Daphne: Can someone help me here? "
"Martin: What is all that? "
"Daphne: Some books Dr. Crane sent for me to get from storage. "
"Frasier: Yes, it's research I'm doing for a novel I'm planning. Gee Daphne, I was beginning to wonder what was taking you so long. "
"Daphne: Well, excuse me. But I did have to move 3 crates, a rowing machine and a cast-iron bath tub out of the way first. "
"Frasier: Oh, look at that. The only book I really wanted was on the shelf already. You'll have to take these back down. [Bell rings from kitchen] "
"Frasier: Oh my God, that's my duck Thank you, Daphne. When you're done with that, I need you to run some errands for me. I need a very sturdy lemon-zester, some more music paper, some potting soil and an easel. "
"Daphne: I'd be happy to. "
"Daphne: And then maybe after that I could draw a bath, strip you naked and scrub you with a loofah. Would that be all right, Dr. Crane? "
"Niles: Yes. "
"Daphne: I didn't even see you standing there. "
"Martin: Hey Niles, can I talk to you about something? "
"Niles: Yeah, just one second, Dad. "
"Niles: OK. "
"Martin: Well, it's about Frasier. Ever since he got fired, he's been so weird. All these projects he's got going... "
"Niles: Yep, don't worry, it's normal. He's simply in a state of denial. "
"Martin: Denial about what? "
"Niles: About getting fired. People like Frasier's whole identities revolve around their job. The loss of the job is like a... is like a death. And they cope with it in the same way they would cope with a death, by going through a series of stages. First one's denial; usually that's followed by anger; then, er... "
"Frasier: I've done it Pierre's most difficult dish done to tangy perfection You know, sometimes I think I missed my calling by not becoming a gourmet chef. "
"Niles: See we're still in stage one. "
"Frasier: Hello, Niles. "
"Niles: Hey Frasier, you ready for our squash date? [Frasier exits kitchen] "
"Frasier: Oh gosh, I'm so sorry, I'm going to have to cancel - I've been cooking all morning. "
"Niles: Oh, what for? "
"Frasier: Well, actually I'm holding a little picnic for the KACL employees and their families. As you may recall I did get them all fired. So I was just hoping to make amends by serving up a little duck a l'orange and an al fresco "
"Martin: You know, people like chips at a picnic too. "
"Frasier: Hello? Ah, yes, Bebe. Yes, yes. Oh yes, the television job. Oh, what a relief. Thank you, bye-bye. "
"Martin: You got it? "
"Frasier: No, thank goodness. That job starts tomorrow - I have got things to do. "
"Niles: Oh, I'm sorry, Frasier. "
"Frasier: Sorry? My God, you sound just like Dad. I am going to get another job. The people of this city need me. I am a beloved Seattle institution. "
"Martin: A couple more days like this and he's going to be in a beloved Seattle institution. "
"TO: "
"Bulldog: Wait till you hear this, I got a job today. [Roz and Frasier congratulate him] "
"Bulldog: You've got to rub me for good luck. "
"Roz: Where? "
"Bulldog: Well, start at my knee and work your way up. "
"Roz: Where's the job? "
"Bulldog: Oh-oh-oh, all right. It's that new all-sports station. I got the breakfast slot. I even came up with a slogan, 'Coffee, eggs and Bulldog.' "
"Frasier: Sounds like some sort of Malaysian Happy Meal. "
"Gil: A word of caution on the hummus. To be avoided - as a leper would avoid a magic tea-cup ride. "
"Roz: Gil, Frasier made that. "
"Gil: Oh, I'm so sorry. "
"Frasier: That's quite all right. I understand you need to flex your critical muscles while you're between jobs. "
"Gil: Oh good, then you might enjoy this "
"one: 'After sampling your , I was tempted to describe your entire Middle Eastern buffet as 'The Sorrow and the Pita.'' Oh, who's got a pencil, I've got to write that one down "
"Tooty: Hi everybody. I just got the most exciting news "
"today: they just picked up my story time theatre on public television. Talk about living happily ever after, eh? Chi-ching "
"TO: Frasier and background. Kenny enters. "
"Kenny: Hey, Dr. Crane "
"Frasier: Oh, well hi, Kenny "
"Kenny: Great party. Oh and by the way, I picked something up for you on my way to work today. "
"Frasier: Work? "
"Kenny: Yeah, yeah. They took me back at my old job. "
"Kenny: I was passing the bus stop and... Excuse me a sec. "
"Kenny: Anyway, they were about to paper over your poster, so I peeled it off for you. "
"Frasier: Well, that is quite a keepsake. . "
"Kenny: Don't mention it. Oh, and by the way, the poster under yours was an old radio guy. Er, a Dr. Earl. Who was he again? "
"Frasier: You know, I'm sorry, I don't recall. "
"Kenny: Yeah, I'm the same way. Once they're off the air, who remembers them? "
"Roz: Do you realize that we're just about the only people here without a job? "
"Frasier: Roz... "
"Roz: If we don't get this Top 100 spot, there may not be any left. "
"Frasier: Roz, I've told "
"you: We have nothing to worry about. Come on... "
"TO: wide view, Frasier calls to everyone. "
"Frasier: Everyone, if I could have your attention, please? We have of course planned some activities for today's little get- together, and I'd like to start with one for the children. "
"Frasier: Now what we have here is an authentic Mexican piñata. The object is to take the stick, and give it a little whack. "
"TO: Gil on his "
"mobile: "
"Gil: Oh, good for me. I just got the Top 100 job. "
"Frasier: Oh well, good for you, Gil. [Holds stick with child] Yes, you're going to want to give this little fellow a good crack. Otherwise... "
"Frasier: You know, maybe I ought to get this started for you. Otherwise the candy will never come out. "
"Frasier: Everybody knows that keeping something locked up inside is never good for anyone, is it? "
"Frasier: Hello? Yes, Bebe. We did hear the news, and how thrilling for Gil. Could you hold, please? "
"Martin: What is this I feel, love. That fear that makes me conceal, love. "
"Niles: Dad... "
"Martin: Was I doing it again? Damn. Was I doing it before Mrs. Walsh got off? "
"Niles: That's why Mrs. Walsh got off. So, what's Frasier doing? "
"Martin: Ah, he's getting weirder. He beat up a piñata yesterday. "
"Niles: Isn't that what you're supposed to do to a piñata? "
"Martin: Not like this. They found a jawbreaker on the other side of the highway. "
"Niles: Oh, well, this is good It means he's reached the anger stage. In due course he'll go through bargaining, depression, and finally acceptance. "
"Martin: What's bargaining? "
"Niles: Oh, well, it's like when a person makes a deal with God to spare their life. "
"Martin: Oh, yeah, I know all about that. "
"Martin: I remember right after I got shot, I said, 'God, if I promise never to drink another bottle of Ballantines, will you let me get through this?' "
"Niles: You still drink Ballantines. "
"Martin: Not in bottles, baby. "
"Frasier: Oh, you're just in time, I'm throwing a party for my fan club. "
"Martin: Here? "
"Niles: Is there some problem with the bridge they normally meet under? "
"Frasier: You see, I've been doing a lot of soul-searching lately, and last night... I did something which I haven't done since I was a very little boy. I got down on my knees on the bedside, and I prayed for guidance. "
"Frasier: And I asked God, 'What can I do to get my old life back?' And the answer came, 'take better care of your fans.' "
"Martin: God told you that? "
"Frasier: Yes. I have taken my public for granted. I take weeks before I answer my fan mail, if I answer it at all. I've been a bad celebrity. Well, no more "
"Martin: I didn't even know you had a fan club. "
"Frasier: Well, they meet on the internet, and I visited their website yesterday for the first time. [Brings hand up to head, and shakes it] Bad celebrity But I invited them all here, and you know what? They were so grateful that before long, I mean, my God, suddenly they were proposing that they hold a massive rally in my honor, demanding that I return to the airwaves. You know, I think that it's safe to say that someone is already working in mysterious ways. "
"Martin: Someone sure as hell is. "
"Waiter: Some crab puffs, Dr. Crane? "
"Frasier: No, no, no, you just keep them away from me. It won't be long before I'm back in the public eye, and I've got to remain tight and trim. "
"Frasier: Oh, Daphne. "
"Martin: What you got there? "
"Daphne: Oh, just a box of Dr. Crane's publicity photos from the storage cubby. "
"Frasier: Thank you. "
"Daphne: This flashlight sure came in handy. Helped me to find that box way up at the top of that old bookcase. And when that thing flew in my hair, I had something to beat it to death with. "
"Frasier: Oh, good Lord, our first arrivals. God, I've got to check the food. Daphne, will you run to the store for me? I need some felt-tip pens to sign these pictures with. Do you mind? "
"Daphne: Sure, what else have I got to do? "
"Aaron: Hi, Daphne. It's Daphne "
"Daphne: Hello. Have we met? "
"Doris: We know you from the magazine. "
"Aaron: April '96, Seattle Monthly, 'At home with Dr. Frasier Crane.' You were wearing an orange flower dress. And your hair was different then. "
"Daphne: Oh, how creepy. Do come in. "
"Frasier: Come in, come in. I'm Dr. Frasier Crane. "
"Doris: Wow Hi, Doris Butley. "
"Frasier: Doris... "
"Aaron: Aaron Fitch. "
"Frasier: Aaron... Oh, it's such a pleasure to meet you. You know, perhaps I should introduce these people to you. [Turns to Niles and Martin. Guests both look surprised.] "
"Doris: Oh, we know who they are. "
"Martin: And now, where we live. "
"TO: Daphne standing by the door. George is waiting there. He is "
"Frasier: Oh don't be shy, come in, come in. "
"George: This is great, this is great "
"Frasier: I'm Dr. Frasier Crane, it's a pleasure to meet you. "
"George: This is great, this is great "
"Aaron: It's cool, isn't it? Your brother having his own club. "
"Niles: Yeah, well, seeing all of you, I sort of wish I had a club myself. "
"Frasier: You know, perhaps you'd like to fill out these name tags while we are waiting for everyone else to come. "
"Aaron: Who else is coming? "
"Frasier: Well, the rest of the fan club. "
"Dorris: This is the fan club - the three of us "
"Daphne: Well, I'll be off to get those pens now "
"Frasier: You know, perhaps you should all help yourself to some food. Um, Niles, may I have a word with you, please? "
"kitchen:] "
"Frasier: Niles "
"Frasier: I can't let them do this rally. Three kooks marching round in a circle, you know what that'll do? "
"Niles: Make them very dizzy very fast. "
"Frasier: Make me a laughingstock - I'll never work in this town again. I mean, I've got to stop them. "
"Waiter: Sorry to interrupt, but I need to carve the second turkey. "
"Niles: No fighting over drumsticks at this party. "
"Frasier: Stop it [Knocks Niles on the arm "
"Frasier: How's everyone out here? "
"Martin: Oh, great. We were just talking about the rally. "
"Frasier: Really, Dad? Oh, I'm glad you brought that up. "
"Martin: They had it this afternoon. "
"Aaron: Right in front of city hall. "
"Doris: It couldn't have gone better. George even stopped traffic by lying across the road on a psychiatrist's couch. The cameramen sure loved that. "
"Frasier: Cameramen? "
"Doris: Oh, what are we doing? It's almost time for the 6 o'clock news "
"Aaron: You're going to love this, Dr. Crane "
"Frasier: Excuse me, what have you got there? "
"Waiter: Er, still the crab puffs. Shall I get you something else? "
"Frasier: Yes please, bring me some spring rolls. "
"TV: Now on the lighter side, did you ever ask yourself, 'What if they held a rally and nobody came? "
"George: This is great, this is great "
"Frasier: Forget the spring rolls, bring me the freakin' turkey "
"TO: "
"Martin: Uh, Frasier... "
"Frasier: Yeah, Dad? "
"Martin: Do you think we could talk to you for a second in the living room? "
"Frasier: Yeah, sure. Gee, sounds kind of serious. "
"Martin: It is, kinda... "
"Frasier: Yeah, what is it? Oh Roz, I didn't hear you come in. "
"Martin: I think you had the blender going. [Both walk over to Martin's chair.] Er, Frasier, we're wondering, do you think you might be depressed? "
"Frasier: Depressed? "
"Roz: Well, we've all noticed that you've put on weight lately. we're worried that you might be eating excessively. "
"Frasier: Well, gee, maybe I've gained a pound or two, but it's nothing I can't handle. "
"Niles: So you think you've got everything under control. "
"Frasier: Absolutely. "
"Martin: It's time, Roz. "
"Roz: Remember when I had that babysitter that was stealing from me, so I had to put in that hidden camera? "
"Frasier: Yes. "
"Roz: And remember when you babysat for me? "
"Frasier: What about it? "
"Roz: Just watch this. "
"TO: shot of the TV, with video playing. It is in black and white, "
"Frasier: Well, baby Alice, I think it's meal time. Let's see what's on tonight's menu. Ah yes, strained beef and lima beans. "
"Frasier: Oh all right, point taken. So I've put on a pound or two- but the camera adds ten "
"TV: "
"Frasier: Come on, yes, now, its very good. Here, I'll show you. [Eats spoonful of food.] Um, oh my. Alright, here, now it's your turn. "
"TO: real Frasier, feeling uneasy with food in his hands. "
"Frasier: No, still? You know, that's not even a proper spoonful. Let's get you a full one. "
"TO: Frasier, looking round at Niles. Niles looks at Frasier. "
"Frasier: That's a nice big one. You know what, let's try something else. Oh, some pureed chicken and yams. [Takes spoonful] Come on now, open up. Open up Now well, if you're not hungry, you're not hungry. My, well. They taste pretty good together. Let's try that. "
"Frasier: Tell you what, what's that you have in your baby cup there? Is that apple juice? "
"Frasier: Oh all right, enough Turn it off. "
"Frasier: Well, I guess maybe you're right, I am depressed. What of it? "
"Martin: Well, you know, we're just trying to help you get to, you know, the next stage. "
"Frasier: Stage of what? "
"Niles: Frasier, you know, I think you're dealing with the loss of your job as many people do with a death. Only you've got yourself stalled in depression, and I think you're going to stay there until you let yourself grieve. For everything you've lost. Your job, your friends, the money, your reputation. [Frasier seems to grudgingly agree.] "
"Roz: You've got to let it out, Frasier. "
"Frasier: Well, I thank you all very much for your concern, but you know what, if I was repressing anything... "
"Frasier: I would certainly know it. The only thing that I need to let out is these so-called one-size-fits-all lounge pants. "
"Roz: Well, that went well. "
"Martin: Yeah, well, we gave it a shot. "
"Daphne: What do we do now? "
"Niles: Well, we can't push him. If he's not ready, he's not ready. "
"Daphne: What was that? "
"Roz: Was that Frasier? "
"Frasier: If anyone's hungry, there's a freshly made Monte Cristo in the waffle press. "
"Martin: Oh great, thanks, Fras. "
"Daphne: Dr. Crane, are you all right? "
"Frasier: Yes. "
"Roz: Are you sure? "
"Frasier: I am quite sure. "
"Niles: Frasier, you're not famous any more. "
"Martin: What did you do that for? "
"Niles: No, no, dad, he needed a push. "
"Martin: Yeah, but look at him, this can't be good. "
"Niles: Oh, it is good. Let it out, Frasier, let it all out. "
"Niles: That's good, that's good. Let it all out. "
"Niles: OK, Frasier, that's probably enough now. "
"Martin: How much more can be in there? "
"Niles: OK, all right, Frasier. That's probably enough now, OK. I don't think I can get him to stop. "
"Martin: This is sickening. "
"Daphne: What are we going to do? "
"Martin: Somebody get that Monte Cristo in here. "
"Roz: Frasier, it's all in how you look at things. Look at my life... "
"Frasier: No career, no relationship, no hope. "
"Roz: You can say the same thing about me. "
"Frasier: I was talking about you "
"Daphne: Dr. Crane, my Grammy Moon used to say... "
"Martin: What are you trying to do, kill him? "
"Daphne: Don't blame this on me. She brought the bloody tape over "
"Roz: Oh, so now this is all my fault. You saw that tape. "
"Daphne: I saw your baby, too. She could stand to miss a meal or two. "
"Roz: She's a healthy baby "
"Frasier: Oh, stop it, stop it all of you. There is no hope. It's over. Over. "
"Martin: Look at that I'm so proud of you, boy. "
"Frasier: Oh dad, you're just saying that "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Hello, Niles. "
"Niles: Frasier, please join me. "
"Frasier: Thank you very much. I would love to have... "
"Waitress: Wait Mochaccino, extra whipped cream and a Linseed Torte, right? "
"Frasier: Not anymore Can I have a non-fat latte please? "
"Waitress: Hey, didn't you used... "
"Frasier: Yes, yes. I used to be on the radio, with any luck I will be again. Thank you for remembering, it does help. "
"Waitress: I was just gonna say, didn't you also used to get a bear claw? "
"Frasier: Off you go "
"Niles: Frasier, I just have to say 'Bravo' You're slim, well- adjusted, you've really turned things around, haven't you? "
"Frasier: Well, it's easy once you hit rock bottom... and bounce Thank you, Niles. I couldn't have done it without you. "
"Niles: I did nothing you wouldn't have done. And you'll be happy to know my own life is on quite the upswing as well. I just got back from a meeting with Maris and her lawyers. "
"Frasier: And? "
"Niles: I think this divorce is going to go very smoothly "

" "
"Niles: That was a very childish prank. Now you have ruined my coffee If you can't behave like adults you shouldn't be coming to a grown-up café "
"Girl: It wasn't us "
"Girl: Aren't you going to yell at them? "
"Niles: They'll have already heard me yell at you. "
"Frasier: Niles, thank you for agreeing to meet me on such short notice, I swear I am in a full-blown crisis. "
"Niles: If you are talking about that garish belt, I have emergency suspenders in my car. "
"Frasier: It's not the belt My high-school reunion is tonight and you know my history. "
"Niles: Oh, not this folderol again. "
"Frasier: It's not folderol "
"Niles: It's folderol. "
"Frasier: It is not folderol Every time my reunion comes around, it coincides with a severe downturn in my life. Five years ago Lilith divorced me; five years before that I was left at the altar; five years before that I fell face first into the poison ivy And here we are right on schedule, I'm freshly fired "
"Niles: I still don't know why you even went that poison ivy year. "
"Frasier: The point is, in ten minutes I have an extremely important job interview - a job which I am eminently qualified for, but now I have no chance of getting. "
"Niles: How can you know that? "
"Frasier: Because destiny won't allow it Destiny plans for me to walk into that reunion this evening the way I always do, the class loser Pitied and shunned by everyone until I end up sitting with the most pathetic people there. "
"Niles: You mean... the chess club? "
"Frasier: Worse The chess club's barbershop quartet. "
"Niles: Oh, the Checkmates "
"Frasier: I swear to God, I feel like I have a curse on my head "
"Niles: Frasier, you are a man of science. You know curses don't exist. There's a perfectly rational explanation for all of this. You tripped and fell into the poison ivy; your radio station changed formats; your wife didn't love you. "
"Frasier: If this is a pep talk, would you kindly segue way to the peppy part? "
"Niles: The only reason why you're giving credence to this curse mumbo-jumbo is because you're nervous about your job interview. You're an intelligent man, any station would be lucky to have you, wouldn't they? "
"Frasier: Yes, I suppose. "
"Niles: You must stop doubting yourself. You deserve that job, so go out there and get it. In an hour's time it'll be yours, and after a short trip to the store to return that belt, you will thoroughly enjoy your reunion. "
"Frasier: Well, you're right, Niles. I should think positive. This interview will go just fine and so will this evening. All I have to do now is get a date - where the hell am I going to find a woman who's so desperate for an evening out she'd agree to go to someone else's reunion? "
"Roz: Hello, Frasier. "
"Niles: See, your luck's changing already "
"Frasier: Hello, excuse me, I'm looking for Stephen Rugley's office. "
"Rugley: Well, you've come to the right place. "
"Frasier: Oh, splendid. Is it possible for you to fetch me a coffee before my interview? "
"Rugley: Well, er... "
"Frasier: Oh, better yet, make it a cup of Chamomile tea, a squirt of lemon and a full teaspoonfull of honey. "
"Rugley: We'll try to get that for you as soon as my assistant gets back. Er, I'm Stephen Rugley. President of KJMC. "
"Frasier: Lord, it's nice to meet you. I'm terribly sorry. "
"Rugley: All right Dr. Crane - it's a great suit, by the way. "
"Frasier: Thank you. "
"Rugley: You're.... "
"Frasier: I know, it's a bit risky. People have been commenting on it all day. "
"Frasier: It makes a bold statement, but frankly I like it I came through the park on the way over here and it caught the eye of many a young lady "
"Frasier: Oh God, my fly I thought you were talking about my belt. "
"Rugley: Well, shall we start the interview? "
"Frasier: Oh, good. We haven't started yet Well... "
"Rugley: I'm glad you could make it, Dr. Crane. I've enjoyed your work. "
"Frasier: Oh, that's very gracious of you, Mr. Ugly. [realises what he "
"said:] Oh, dear God, I just said... "
"Rugley: What do you mean? "
"Frasier: Oh, I just said your name right now and it sounded like I called you Mr. Ugly. I assure you it won't happen again. It's just a matter of seperating the r's. Mr. Rug, Mr. Rug, Mr. Rug... "
"Frasier: ...ley. Mr. Rugley. "
"Rugley: Anyway, I think you might be a good fit here. We need to find a replacement for Dr. Wendy. "
"Frasier: Really? "
"Rugley: Yes, we didn't feel it was quite right to keep her on any longer. "
"Frasier: Well, let me say I applaud your judgement on that score. I mean, frankly, Dr. Wendy's saccharine style - it may be very popular, but you know, it's really not up to your standards, is it? "
"Rugley: Dr. Wendy's my mother. She's quite ill. "
"Assistant: Can I interrupt? "
"Frasier: Oh, please "
"Assistant: You have some messages. "
"Rugley: Excuse us for a moment? "
"Frasier: Of course. "
"Assistant: Mr. Jaminson has to cancel. "
"Rugley: Oh, very well. Why don't you call Phyllis Monderat and she if she can reschedule. "
"Rugley: Oh, and see if you can pick up my car from the shop. "
"Assistant: I already did. It's across the street. Somebody parked this BMW in your space. "
"Rugley: Well, have it towed "
"Assistant: I already made the call. "
"Rugley: Dr. Crane? "
"Frasier: Yes? "
"Rugley: We don't have any tea, but would you like some coffee? "
"Frasier: That'll be splendid, yes, thank you. "
"Rugley: What was that? "
"Frasier: Nothing. "
"Rugley: Is this my giraffe from my cabinet? "
"Frasier: Yes, it is. I'm sorry, I was admiring it and it broke apart in my hands. But you know, if your child is anything like mine, he'd be delighted to make you a new one "
"Rugley: Actually, my father made it after his stroke. "
"Frasier: Well, I think you've got enough to go on. It was lovely meeting you. "
"Frasier: Oh, well I'm going to have to rush if I'm gonna beat that tow-truck. "
"TO: "
"Martin: Hold the elevator, Niles. Thanks. "
"Niles: Hi, Dad. "
"Martin: I'm never going to that grocery store across the street again. They gave me such a hard time just because I brought Eddie in. "
"Niles: Well, it's not exactly sanitary, dad. "
"Martin: Oh yeah? Well, when they get rid of the guy with pinkeye who's handing out cheese samples, then they can talk to me about sanitary. "
"Niles: Didn't you bring home a case of dog food yesterday? "
"Martin: Yeah It was the economy stuff, he wouldn't touch it, so I've got to take all of it back. This is his favorite kind. "
"Niles: Well, I guess what they say is "
"true: Once you've tasted animal by-products you can't go back to the cheap stuff Hey, will you pick the restaurant for tonight? "
"Martin: Hey, I've got a better idea than that My old precinct's having one of their seized property auctions down at the fairgrounds. "
"Niles: Oh, what's the better idea? "
"Martin: Come on, Niles, these drug dealers have some pretty nice stuff "
"Niles: I guess I've been searching for a wide-brimmed purple velvet hat... It's not quite, er, me. "
"Martin: I tell you what, we'll just go for a little while and then we'll come back here for dinner. "
"Daphne: Am I glad you're home. "
"Martin: What's wrong? "
"Daphne: Dr. Crane Ever since he came back from his job interview he seemed awfully depressed. In fact, he's as bad as I've ever seen him "
"Niles: Oh, I guess it didn't go well. "
"Daphne: I gather not. He mumbled something about it being worse than the Dresden premiere of Schumann's Second Symphony. "
"Niles: And you left him alone? "
"Daphne: He's in the kitchen "
"Niles: Frasier "
"Niles: Oh my God Frasier, are you all right? "
"Frasier: I was fine before you screamed, what the hell's wrong with you? "
"Niles: Well, Daphne said you were depressed and here you are with your head in the oven. "
"Frasier: I was cleaning it, Niles. It's electric. "
"Frasier: If I wanted to end my life I'd choose something faster than broiling. "
"Martin: Sorry your interview didn't go well, Fras. "
"Frasier: Oh, it's alright, Dad. You know, things don't work out the way we'd like them to sometimes. [watches Daphne push the trolley by with Eddie in] Much like my strict, 'No shopping trolleys in the apartment policy.' "
"Martin: Don't worry about it. I'll take it back, but I need to return all that cheap dog food. "
"Frasier: You know, Dad, I'm going down to pick up some cleaning supplies, I'll do it. "
"Martin: Well, I thought you needed to get ready for the reunion? "
"Frasier: Oh God, no, I'm not going "
"Martin: Why? "
"Frasier: Because I'm cursed. If I wasn't convinced before today's interview, I certainly am now. "
"Martin: But you haven't even heard anything. For all you know you might have gotten it. "
"Frasier: Believe me, dad. I have a better chance of being crowned 'Miss Teen USA.' "
"Frasier: Oh, dear God "
"Roz: Well, just how casual is this thing tonight? "
"Frasier: Roz, I'm so sorry, I completely forgot to call and tell you that, well, we're not going "
"Roz: Wait a second I found a babysitter at the last minute. I got a new dress, I got Michelle to do my hair and just spent the last hour listening to the Estee Lauder lady describing her bladder operation just so I could get a free makeover. And now you're saying we're not going? "
"Frasier: Roz, I can't go. You see, I have a curse on my head. "
"Roz: What curse? "
"Niles: He thinks the Fates are conspiring to humiliate him at every reunion. "
"Martin: Oh come on, you don't really believe that, do you? "
"Frasier: All right, let's examine the evidence. Daphne, would you assist me, please? This is my school newsletter. "
"Daphne: The Bryce Academy Crier "
"Niles: Which, coincidentally, was Frasier's nickname the first year he was there. "
"Frasier: Go to page eight Scott Alexander, what's he been up to? "
"Daphne: Wife, kids, has his own computer software business. "
"Frasier: Patsy Curds. "
"Daphne: Mother of three, successful physician, has invented a drug that may aid in the treatment of cancer. "
"Frasier: Won't they go green with envy when I top them all with this story of my "
"life: Frasier Crane, unattached, unemployed and living with his father. He spends his days scrubbing his oven and is anxiously awaiting his upcoming tooth cleaning. "
"Martin: Now, now, Frasier. Everyone has their ups and downs. You know, for all we know that cure for cancer didn't pan out either. "
"Niles: One can only hope, Dad. "
"Daphne: I bet if you just went in there with a sunny attitude, you'd have a good time. "
"Frasier: No, I tried sunny last time, you know where it got me? Table 97, singing 'Goodbye my Coney Island Baby' with the Checkmates. "
"Roz: Well, maybe this time will be different. "
"Frasier: That's the mistake I always make. Thinking that this year it will be different, that I can beat the curse. Well, that's because it makes you think you can beat it but you can't So, Roz, I apologize, I'll make this up to you some day. But right now, I'm going to go down to the store and run a little errand for my friend Eddie And then I'm coming back home and spending the evening with Daphne, doing some light housework and listening to my new psychoanalysis "
"tape: 'Depression, Anxiety and Death' as read by the author himself, Stanislav Monk. "
"Daphne: Now who's cursed? "
"Time: 12"
":00) "
"Frasier: Excuse me, sir, there's a place to recycle those cans right over there. "
"Man: Oh, I know. "
"Frasier: On behalf of Mother Earth, I thank you "
"Frasier: That's the sort of person who drinks chocolate soda. "
"Percy: Frasier Crane. "
"Frasier: Yes. Percy Williams, ho-ho, good to see you. I suppose you're on your way to the reunion. "
"Percy: Yes, yes I am. "
"Frasier: I couldn't make it this year myself. A little too much on my Plate, things have gotten crazy. "
"Percy: I see there, I heard you went off the radio. "
"Frasier: You did? "
"Percy: You know, my wife heads up a charity that helps get homeless people back on their feet. "
"Frasier: Yes, I know. The Scrap Foundation, it's very popular in my circle. "
"Percy: You should call, they could help you. "
"Frasier: Me? Oh, that's very funny. The shopping cart with all the dog food. I'm afraid you're suffering from the wrong impression. "
"Percy: Dog food? "
"Frasier: Oh, it's not mine. It's my father's. "
"Percy: Oh, Frasier... "
"Frasier: No, really, you're "
"mistaken: I'm not homeless. I live in that luxury building right there. [Percy obviously doesn't believe him] Number 1901. "
"Percy: Frasier, take this. "
"Frasier: I don't need it. I drive a BMW, I collect African art. "
"Percy: You always were a proud one. "
"Frasier: I'm not proud. "
"Percy: Then take it For God sakes, spend it on food. "
"Frasier: I just threw out a $200 belt "
"TO: "
"Daphne: Hey, how was the police auction? "
"Martin: Oh, you didn't miss anything. Especially when it started raining. "
"Niles: I made out like a bandit Those drug lords have the most incredible "
"taste: Christophle, silver, Limogés. Oh, Morivors chrystal. If I ever get married again, I'm going to register there. "
"Frasier: Hello, all. "
"Niles: I thought you were staying home? "
"Frasier: Yes, well, not any more. I ran into Percy Williams down at the grocery store. He mistook me for a street person. If I don't get down there and defend myself he'll be passing around that rumor along with the Swedish meatballs. "
"Daphne: Well, I'm glad you're going, Dr. Crane. You'll have a nice time, and you look great. "
"Frasier: Thank you. "
"Roz: You have no idea how big you owe me "
"Frasier: Yes I do, Roz, and I will never ask you for another favor again - except could you possibly do something with your hair? It seems to be leaning. "
"Roz: Frasier, when you called I was in the tub with a pint of Haägen-Daaz - considering that was fifteen minutes ago I think I look pretty good. "
"Frasier: I appreciate it, Roz, I really do. Daphne, could you please help Roz getting finished? "
"Roz: I am finished. "
"Frasier: No, no, no, finish more. And... remember what I told you. "
"Roz: Oh yeah, "
"right: I'm a model-slash-doctor-slash-daughter of the Duke of Luxembourg. "
"Daphne: Yes, come along, Your Grace. "
"Niles: Frasier, are you actually so desperate that you're trying to impress those people by having Roz pretend to be some sort of trophy girlfriend? "
"Frasier: Trophy duchess Niles, it's the only way to beat the curse. "
"Niles: You can beat the curse by not going. "
"Frasier: I tried that, Niles, you see where that got me. The curse found a way to humiliate me in absentia. I've got to get down there. "
"Niles: Why? To win the approval of some virtual strangers. "
"Frasier: I know it sounds foolish, Niles... "
"Niles: No, it's not foolish. It's human. I think it's all about the feelings of inferiority you've been carrying with you since high school. That's the real curse. Only, you're not the Bryce Crier anymore, you're a successful man. You have an opportunity for real growth here. Not by trying to impress these people, but by realizing that they don't matter anymore. "
"Frasier: Oh, Roz, you look beautiful "
"Roz: Thank you. "
"Frasier: But we're not going "
"Roz: What? "
"Frasier: It's got something to do with my personal growth. You see, I don't care about these people anymore and you know, I want them to know it. "
"Roz: Frasier, I hired a babysitter twice, I did my makeup twice, I performed a miracle of engineering by taping myself into this dress twice - only to be stood up twice "
"Frasier: Roz, technically you only did your hair once. "
"Roz: You know, some day you're gonna need another favour from me, buddy, and when that day comes, I hope you know what you can do with it. "
"Frasier: I have a pretty good idea. "
"Roz: Well, do it twice "
"Frasier: Well, that was something. "
"Niles: Please, you call that a tantrum? Maris used to do that once a week. The poor thing needed help slamming the door "
"Martin: Frasier, I was just talking to Duke on the phone and your agent flicked in. She was calling from a pay phone and she couldn't really talk, but she said that KPOV wants you to host your own show for them. "
"Frasier: My own television show "
"Daphne: On KPOV "
"Frasier: Thank you, all. "
"Niles: I just realised. This is an even bigger opportunity for personal growth. Having a prestigious new job like this and not even going to the reunion to boast about it "
"Frasier: It's a great opportunity, isn't it "
"Niles: Have a good time. "
"Frasier: I will. "
"Niles: I must say, Frasier did have a run of bad luck this week. I'm certainly glad it worked out better for him. "
"Martin: No, he didn't really get a call, I just made it all up. "
"Niles: His agent didn't call? "
"Martin: No, I just wanted to give the guy something to brag about. "
"Niles: Dad, I know you were trying to help, but don't you think that's a little risky? What if somebody at the reunion knows it's not true? "
"Martin: Oh, no, you worry too much. Who's gonna know? I mean most of these people are from out of town, they've probably never heard of KPOV "
"Daphne: I knew it When you said KPOV, I thought it sounded familiar and it's right here in Dr. Crane's newsletter. His classmate, Calvin Gurdstone, was just made station manager. Won't that be nice for them; they'll be working together now. "
"Niles: Oh, my God "
"Martin: Oh, come on, it'll be all right, don't worry about it. This Gurdstone probably won't even show - he's just got a new job, he's probably real busy. "
"Niles: Well, you're right. I musn't assume the worst. I'm acting like Frasier, as if there really is a curse. "
"Daphne: Look here, he's also serving as this year's reunion coordinator. "
"TO: "
"Checkmates: "
"Frasier: Hi, fellas. "
"Checkmate: Hi. "
"Frasier: Hit it. "
": Hello... "
": Hello... "
": Hello... "
"Frasier: Hello... "
"Checkmates: Goodbye, my Coney Island baby, Farewell, my own true love, true love- "
"Frasier: Oh, honey "
"Checkmates: I'm gonna go away and leave you, Never to see you any- "
"Frasier: Never gonna see you any- "
"Checkmates: I'm gonna sail upon that ferry boat... "

"Martin: Don't walk away from me when I'm yellin' at you "
"Frasier: I'll walk away from you if I want to It's my house "
"Martin: Yes, don't I know it You have no respect for my stuff "
"Frasier: Yes, well if you had labeled the cassette 'Rodeo Bloopers', I wouldn't have taped over it, I would have thrown it away "
"Frasier: Dad, I'm sorry. "
"Martin: Forget it, Fras. "
"Frasier: You know, it's just that I've been so tense lately, being out of work. "
"Martin: I know, I know. It's not easy, us both being home so much. "
"Frasier: Yeah, well I suppose that during this little in-between-jobs period, we should just try to be extra careful not to get on each other's nerves. "
"Martin: All right, I'll do that. "
"Frasier: Good. Dad, what's this? "
"Martin: Oh, a call came in for you. "
"Frasier: Rebecca Wendell Oh my God "
"Martin: Isn't she that model you've been after? "
"Frasier: Not just a model, Dad, a lingerie model I met her at the symphony. Wow, this is amazing When did this come in? "
"Martin: About an hour ago. "
"Frasier: I was here an hour ago. "
"Martin: Yeah, you were in the tub. "
"Frasier: That didn't stop you yesterday when you came in to ask me if a peach smelled funny For God's sake, Dad... "
"Martin: I'd like to know how this is my fault I put it right there in the special message bowl that we're all supposed to use. "
"Frasier: Ah, it's her machine. Well, thanks a lot, Dad I've been looking forward to this for months "
"Martin: Well, now you know how I feel about the rodeo tape. "
"Frasier: Oh, for God's sake, the two things have no comparison whatsoever... Hello, Rebecca, it's Frasier. Sorry I missed you. Please try again. Uh, bye. Well, I hope you're happy Now I have to sit here all afternoon waiting for the phone to ring "
"Martin: As opposed to what you normally do? "
"Frasier: Oh, that's rich coming from you A man who’s spent the last five years welded to his aptly named Lay-Z-Boy "
"Martin: Well, I'm not so lazy that I can't get the hell out of here "
"Frasier: I haven't finished talking to you, yet "
"Martin: Well, I've finished listening "
"Frasier: As usual, running away from the problem "
"Martin: Not the problem, the yammering You want to tape over somethin'? Try your mouth "
"Roz: Hey, Martin. "
"Martin: Oh, hi, Roz. "
"Roz: Decaf latte to go, please. So, is Frasier here? "
"Martin: I hope not. "
"Roz: Uh-oh. "
"Martin: Oh, he's just been such a pill lately. "
"Roz: Well, you know, it's tough for people when they're out of work. They just get a little tense and irritable. [The waitress brings Roz a coffee cup.] To go I said to go So why don't you two take a little break from each other? Have you ever thought about, I don't know, staying with Niles for a while? "
"Martin: Out of the frying pan into the fire, huh? "
"Roz: Well, think about it. Niles's place is so huge, and he's at work all the time. "
"Martin: That's true. And Maris is out of the picture now. "
"Roz: You know, I just thought of "
"something: for a while there, your daughters-in-law were Maris and Lilith. Whoa, Happy Thanksgiving "
"Martin: Yeah. "
"Martin: Hey, Niles. "
"Niles: Hello. "
"Roz: Niles. "
"Niles: I'm not interrupting anything personal, am I? "
"Roz: Yeah, Niles, we just eloped. I'm your new mom. "
"Niles: Well, I'll be a son of a bitch. "
"Niles: Latte, please. "
"Roz: So Martin, why don't you tell Niles your new idea? "
"Martin: Well, actually, it was Roz's idea, but I think she might have something, you know? You know, Frasier and I have been kinda buttin' heads lately... "
"Niles: Well, Frasier has been very difficult. I don't know how you live with him. "
"Martin: Well, that was Roz's idea. She suggested that I move in with you for a while. "
"Niles: Did she? "
"Martin: Yeah. You know, we talked about it when I first got shot, but of course Maris was the problem. So I guess the big question now "
"is: do you still want me? "
"Niles: Oh, don't be silly. I want you just as much now as I wanted you then. "
"Martin: Well, I guess this is gonna work out. Thanks, Roz. "
"Roz: Don't mention it. The look on Niles's face is thanks enough. "
"Niles: Now, Dad, you're sure it won't bother you to live so far from the park and McGinty's? "
"Martin: Oh, no, no, not at all. There's a bus stop right in front of your place. Eddie and I don't mind takin' the bus. "
"Niles: Eddie? Eddie. You know, I just remembered, Dad, my building doesn't allow dogs. "
"Martin: Oh, well that's it, then. 'Cause I'm not leavin' Eddie. "
"Niles: Oh, of all the horrendous luck. "
"Martin: Oh, well, thanks anyway. I guess I'll just look for a little place. Can't be too small, though, 'cause I gotta have a bedroom for Daphne. "
"Niles: You know, Dad. About that no dog "
"rule: I could talk to Clarice, the head of our co-op board. "
"Martin: Oh, really? You think they'd make an exception? "
"Niles: Well, let's just say she's bent quite a few rules in her day, and if she doesn't want her husband to find out, she'll bend this one. "
"Martin: Oh, that's great "
"Niles: Yes, well, then it's settled. Daphne can move in straight away. YOU and Daphne. "
"Martin: Great "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Oh, hello Niles. "
"Niles: Frasier, where's Daphne? "
"Frasier: I think at the market. Hello, Dad. "
"Martin: Ah, Frasier, about this afternoon... "
"Frasier: Look, let's just drop it, all right? All's well that end's well, and this afternoon ended very well indeed. "
"Martin: Oh, your underwear model called? "
"Frasier: Mm-hmm. Just after you left, actually. We spoke for about an hour, and we're having dinner on Saturday night. "
"Martin: Well, that's great I hope everything works out. "
"Frasier: Actually, Dad, on that score, uh, you could make yourself scarce that night. "
"Martin: Well, actually, I'm movin' in with Niles for a couple of months. "
"Frasier: Well, have some confidence in me, Dad, it won't take me that long. "
"Martin: Nah, no, no, no. I mean it. Niles and I have been talking about it. "
"Niles: Yes. And I think it's a fine idea. "
"Frasier: Well, you know, I know I've been out of sorts lately, Dad, but I hope I haven't made you feel unwelcome... "
"Martin: No, no. It's nothin' like that. Listen, I've been livin' under your roof for five years now, you've earned a little time to yourself. "
"Frasier: Still, maybe you should sleep on it for tonight... "
"Niles: Frasier, Frasier, please. You've had a chance to get closer to Dad these past few years and I wouldn't mind having that same chance myself. Frankly, I'm a bit jealous. "
"Frasier: Well, I am sorry, Niles. I guess I haven't been seeing this from your angle. "
"Daphne: Hello, all. "
"Niles: Hello, Daphne. "
"Frasier: And quite a little angle it is, too. "
"Martin: Oh, Daph, let me ask you somethin'. How would you feel about movin' in with Niles? "
"Daphne: Are you serious? "
"Niles: Yes. "
"Daphne: Just me? "
"Niles: Yes. No, no. And Dad. "
"Martin: Just 'til Frasier goes back to work. It's been a little crowded around here. "
"Daphne: Well, I won't argue with that. You know, Dr. Crane has quite a few stairs, are you sure you can manage them? "
"Martin: Oh, sure. Nobody knows better than you how my well my hip's gettin'. "
"Niles: Well, what are we waiting for? Let's get you packed. "
"Daphne: Wait a minute. I was hired as Mr. Crane's physical therapist. If he can make it up and down that staircase of yours, he really doesn't need full time care anymore. This is hard for me to say, but maybe it's time I moved on. "
"Daphne: We all knew this day would come sooner or later. "
"Martin: What about my exercises? "
"Daphne: You'll do fine on your own. Believe me, it's not like I want to move on, I'm very fond of you all. I'm not like a psychiatrist, who works with someone for years and years and it doesn't matter if they ever get better. [Martin nods in understanding, Frasier and Niles share a look.] My work here is done. I have to go where I'm needed. "
"Daphne: It's not like I'm leaving right this minute. I'll help you get settled in while I look for a new job. "
"Niles: But Daphne... "
"Daphne: Oh, please, don't make a big fuss about this. You'll just make me cry. This is no time for tears. "
"Martin: Well, I guess you know what's best. It's sure gonna be lonely, though, just the two of us. "
"Daphne: It won't just be the two of you, you'll have Eddie. "
"Niles: Dad? "
"Martin: Eddie, whatever you're on, get off. "
"to: the kitchen. Daphne is on the phone. "
"Daphne: I've been on hold with my employment agency forever. [into phone] Yes, I'm here. Nothing at all, not even part-time therapy? Well, I'll stay in touch. Bye-bye. "
"Niles: So, no job yet, eh? "
"Daphne: No, unfortunately. Still, tragedies happen every day. I mustn't give up hope. "
"Niles: I wish you'd consider staying here with us. I don't know how Dad's going to manage without you. "
"Daphne: He doesn't need me anymore. "
"Niles: Nonsense. I know he puts on a brave front, the plain truth is, the man is practically an invalid. "
"Martin: All right, come back here "
"Daphne: What's he got now? "
"Martin: Oh, my sneaker. You give me that back or I'm not taking you for your speed walk "
"to: the living room. Martin opens the door for Frasier. "
"Martin: Oh, hi Frasier. "
"Frasier: Hi, Dad. Hi, Niles. Forgive me, I know how annoying it can be to drop by without calling first. "
"Niles: Oh, don't worry, I used to do it all the time. "
"Frasier: That's how I know. Hello, Eddie. Got a little surprise for you, something you left at the house. There you are. "
"Frasier: Don't worry, Niles, you'll get used to it. Oh, and Dad, I've got a little surprise for you as well. Just a minute. All right, boys, bring it on in here. "
"Martin: Oh, great, here it is Now the place is starting to look like home. "
"Frasier: Yes, and finally so is mine "
"Martin: Well, I'm just gonna go finish unpacking. "
"Niles: Well, you just follow him up with that. "
"Martin: Oh, no, no, leave it right there. That way I won't get my pizza cheese all over your fancy chairs. "
"Niles: Doesn't the cheese go in your mouth? "
"Frasier: Well, that's certainly the goal, Niles, but you can't hit that bulls eye every time. "
"Niles: OK, this isn't working out, you have to take him back now. "
"Frasier: Niles, he's only been here for eight hours. "
"Niles: I don't care. I only signed on for this because Daphne came in the bargain and now she's leaving and Frasier, you have to help me, I'm desperate "
"Martin: Niles, which wall should I hang my swordfish on? "
"Niles: None of them I just had that room frescoed "
"to: Kitchen. Daphne is again on the phone. "
"Frasier: Daph... "
"Daphne: Thanks, Ronny, you're a life saver. Bye-bye. "
"Frasier: Well, good news on the job front? "
"Daphne: Yes, a friend of mine just got me an interview. It's an elderly woman suffering from brittle bone disease, poor thing. "
"Frasier: Well, normally I'd say 'Break a leg', but... "
"Daphne: Oh, I'm gonna miss you. All of you. But like I told your brother, there's simply no reason for me to stay as long as your father's so strong and healthy. "
"Frasier: Oh, dear God. "
"to: the living room. Martin is lying at the bottom of the stairs. "
"Frasier: Oh, my God Dad "
"Daphne: Oh, are you all right? "
"Martin: Yeah. "
"Frasier: What happened? "
"Niles: I don't know. "
"Martin: We just got tangled up there. "
"Niles: Dad, I am so sorry "
"Martin: Don't worry about it, it was an accident. "
"Daphne: Well, you do seem to be in one piece. Still, it was an awfully big fall. Dr. Crane, would you help me get some ice? "
"Niles: Good thinking, Daphne. I know I could use a drink. "
"Martin: Boy, that was so weird. Niles just kicked my cane right out from under me. "
"Martin: Yeah, I know he wants to keep Daphne around here, but I didn't think he'd go that far. "
"Frasier: Well, no, not deliberately, but maybe he was acting on an unconscious level. "
"Martin: What are you talking about? I was just making a joke. "
"Frasier: Oh. Well, then just-just skip it, Dad. "
"Martin: No, no, wait a minute. You think Niles was actually trying to hurt me? "
"Frasier: No, no. It's just that... well, sometimes, when the motivation is strong enough, the unconscious can cause a person to act in ways that the conscious would find unthinkable. "
"Martin: So you're saying that this wasn't an accident. "
"Frasier: ...Ah, it's a crazy theory. I'm sorry I even brought it up. You know what? I, uh, I think I'll be off now. Off to my bachelor pad, I have a date with a lingerie model. Ha, ha, ha... 'bachelor pad, lingerie model' - the sweetest words in the English language. "
"Martin: I'm sorry I won't be there. "
"Frasier: Wait. We have a tie "
"Niles: Frasier. "
"Daphne: All right, Mr. Crane, I need you to take a seat so I can ice your hip. "
"Martin: Oh, I'm fine. Why is everyone making such a fuss? "
"Daphne: Wait, don't sit down "
"Martin: What? "
"Daphne: You nearly impaled yourself. "
"Niles: Oh, thank you Daphne. I don't know what it is about these things, they keep ending up in the oddest places. "
"TO: "
"Rebecca: Hi, Frasier, it's Rebecca. Your voice sounds so sexy on your machine. Anyway, I loved talking to you this afternoon and I was "
"thinking: instead of going to a noisy restaurant, maybe we can just stay in tonight. Open some wine, curl up in front of a fire. Just a warning though, I'm coming straight from a shoot, so I'll be wearing my work clothes. I can't believe I just said that. "
"Rebecca: Hi, Frasier, it's Rebecca. Your voice sounds so sexy on your machine. Anyway, I loved talking to you... "
"TO: "
"Martin: Boy, the floors around here are so slippery "
"Niles: Yes, I, I just had them polished. "
"Martin: Well, I wish you would have told me, Eddie just slid into a wall and chipped a tooth. "
"Niles: Well, Dad, I can assure you there will be no slipping in here. "
"Look: a brand new safety rail installed just for you. And, as requested, traction decals "
"Martin: Oh, I don't need to worry about falling in... "
"Niles: Oh, Dad, are you OK? "
"Martin: Wow, yeah. It's a good thing I wasn't in the shower, I could have cracked my head open. "
"Niles: Guess I'm not much of a handyman, am I? "
"Martin: You put this thing up yourself? "
"Niles: Yes, my contractor was out of town. Don't worry, you can use my bathroom to shower. Just let me know when you do. The plumbing's a bit temperamental and if I were to run the dishwasher, you might be horribly scalded. "
"Martin: You know? I took an extra long shower yesterday, you know? That oughta hold me. "
"TO: the living room. Niles is coming down from the landing with "
"Niles: You sure you don't need a hand? "
"Martin: Just keep movin'. "
"Daphne: Guess what? I got the job I can't believe it I start in the morning. "
"Niles: You what? "
"Daphne: I'll tell you all about it later. I've got to call my employment agency right away. "
"Niles: I can't let her leave. I just can't. "
"Martin: Well, there's nothin' we can do about it. "
"Niles: I still have a day. I just have to be more resourceful. "
"Martin: "
"Niles: It's my problem, not yours. I just have to think. Fresh air, maybe that'll calm me down. "
"Niles: Oh, look at the sunset Dad, come join me on the balcony. "
"Martin: Eddie Get outta here Quick Come on, come on, come on "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Dad Good lord, what are you doing here? [He uses the remote to shut off the stereo.] "
"Martin: We gotta talk. "
"Frasier: Now? It's not a good time. "
"Martin: But it's getting spooky over at Niles's. "
"Frasier: Well, yes, yes, I know it's a little unsettling the way he changes into that Chinese dressing gown after dinner, but you'll get used to it. "
"Martin: No, no, no. I think his unconscious is trying to hurt me. "
"Frasier: Oh, Dad, that's preposterous. "
"Martin: No it isn't. "
"Frasier: Can't we talk about this in the morning? Believe me, there is no way your own flesh and blood would try to hurt you. "
"Frasier: Oh, I'm sorry. "
"Martin: Well at least let me get Eddie's pillow out of my room, will you? "
"Frasier: All right, all right, just hurry it up, will ya? "
"Frasier: Daphne What is going on? "
"Daphne: I hope I'm not catching you at a bad time. "
"Frasier: Well, actually, I'm waiting for a date "
"Daphne: I'll just run in and out, I need to pick up my... [she starts crying]...exercise mat. "
"Frasier: Oh, good lord. Is everything all right? "
"Daphne: I'm sorry. I think I'm just a bit nervous about my new job. "
"Frasier: Yes. "
"Daphne: I'll be all right. "
"Frasier: Yes. "
"Daphne: I just wish, I just wish I didn't miss being here so much. "
"Frasier: Oh, Daphne, oh, I'm sorry. Listen, you're going to be just fine. You know, transitions are always difficult. [The doorbell rings and he shoves her towards her room.] The trick is just not to rush them. "
"Frasier: Niles What the hell are you doing here? "
"Niles: I'm going out of my mind. I am this close to living under the same roof as Daphne. If I could just... "
"Frasier: All right, Niles, before you go on, let me just say one thing. "
"Niles: What is it? "
"Frasier: Get out "
"Niles: Wait, wait I need to talk about this. "
"Frasier: Get out Niles "
"Martin: Is that Niles? "
"Niles: Dad Dad, why did you run off? I've been looking for you everywhere. "
"Martin: No, Niles, just stay away from me. "
"Niles: What? "
"Martin: Now, Niles, I'm not mad at you, just your unconscious. It wants Daphne to stay around so bad that it's been tryin' to hurt me. "
"Niles: What? "
"Martin: Well, Frasier can explain it better. "
"Niles: Exactly who is hurting whom and what does any of this have to do with... Daphne. "
"Daphne: Oh, look. We're all together again, just like... [crying again] old times. "
"Niles: Oh, dear. "
"Frasier: Oh, God. Well, we certainly do have a lot to talk about. I tell you "
"what: let's all meet at Niles's for breakfast tomorrow. "
"Martin: I'm not gettin' in the elevator with him. "
"Frasier: All right Dad, Daphne, go in shifts then. You first. "
"Daphne: All right. "
"Frasier: So long. Eddie, you too, shake a leg mister. Let's go, outta here, move it, move it, move it. [Eddie scurries out and Frasier closes the door behind him.] "
"Niles: You actually convinced Dad I was trying to harm him? "
"Frasier: Oh, Niles, I did no such thing. I simply advanced a theory, I had no idea he would take it to heart. "
"Niles: Oh, balderdash "
"Frasier: Please, Niles, surely it's occurred to you that your desire for Daphne's forcing you to behave in very strange ways. Or do you shove Dad down the stairs every day? "
"Niles: That was an accident "
"Frasier: Oh, Niles, any psychiatrist worth his salt knows that there are no accidents. No one would do something like that, however unconsciously, unless they stood to gain from it. "
"Frasier: Oh, dear "
"to: the hallway following them. "
"Frasier: Oh, my God "
"Niles: Oh, thank God ...we're here to help "
"Martin: What did you kick my cane for? "
"Daphne: It was an accident I was playing with Eddie "
"Martin: My hip's killing me "
"Frasier: Dad, don't worry about it. Niles has that nice comfy bed you can recuperate in. "
"Martin: I can't go up and down those stairs now "
"Niles: I think the best thing would be for him to stay with you again for the time being. "
"Daphne: He'll need full time attention, I'll cancel my job right away. "
"Frasier: All right, just hold it Nobody's canceling anything For God's sake, the man just fell down a flight of stairs today, he could hardly have been hurt worse stumbling in a carpeted hallway "
"Frasier: Get up, ya big crybaby No pain, no gain. "
"Martin: Oh, no, but it hurts "
"Frasier: Oh, Dad, boo-hoo I want you out of here I don't care if you have to crawl like a bog turtle "
"Frasier: Oh, Rebecca. I didn't see you standing there. Why don't you just step on over my father, help yourself to some wine? "
"Rebecca: What kind of a heartless bastard are you? "
"Frasier: Oh, no, Rebecca, you don't understand. It's not the way it looks. He's very resilient He's been shot before "
"Daphne: Dr. Crane, we really should get him inside. "
"Frasier: Yes. Just give me... a moment. "
"Frasier: All right, bring him in. "

"Frasier: Well, I better be heading out. Niles and I are meeting for dinner, and then we have tickets to the theatrical event of the season. "
"Martin: Oh, really? "
"Frasier: Yes, Sir Trevor Aimsley in 'Tears of the Mariner.' "
"Martin: Oh. "
"Frasier: It promises to be a very exciting evening. You see, Seattle is Sir Trevor's last stop on his farewell tour. After this, he's retiring from the stage forever. "
"Martin: 'Tears of the Mariner.' You know, I think I read a review of that. Thought it was one of those baseball stories like 'Pride of the Yankees', you know? But it's just about some crabby old sailor, stuck in this little town... "
"Frasier: No, no, Dad, please. I have carefully avoided all the reviews of this play. I do not want to hear about it before I see it. "
"Martin: Well, I don't want to hear about it after you see it. "
"Frasier: Oh, hello Daphne. "
"Martin: Hey, Daph. "
"Daphne: That's it? 'Hello Daphne'? Haven't you seen the paper? "
"Martin: Well, I glanced at it. Why, did I miss something? "
"Daphne: Look "
"Martin: Oh, my gosh Is that you? "
"Daphne: Yes "
"Frasier: Well, good heavens, it's kind of hard to tell. You've got your back turned to the camera, your skirts blown up around your... Oh, well, it must've been rather blustery out. "
"Daphne: I was in the park yesterday, and this photographer snapped my picture for the 'It's Your Seattle' column - the one where they show some average person out and about, then use their name on the column. For instance, if they used a picture of Mr. Crane, the caption would read 'Martin Crane's Seattle.' Or if they took one of you it would say 'Frasier Crane's Se-' "
"Frasier: Yes, we get it. "
"Daphne: Well, don't crinkle it, I want to send it home to my family. "
"Martin: You sure about that? "
"Daphne: Oh, don't be such an old fogey. So I'm bending down and me knickers are showing a bit, but my family'll still be proud as peacocks when they see "
"that: 'Daphne Moon's Seattle'. "
"Frasier: She certainly does. "
"Frasier: Niles, will you just stop it? The dinner was just fine. "
"Niles: It was not fine. I made those reservations weeks ago. They seated us so close to the kitchen I'm surprised they didn't make us wear hair nets. "
"Frasier: I'm sure it was just a mix-up. "
"Niles: It's not a mix-up. It's part of an alarming trend I've noticed ever since Maris and I parted company. "
"Frasier: Oh, Niles. "
"Niles: Last week, Roberta Phipps snubbed me at the opera. I wasn't even invited to that gala fundrasier for St. Andrew's Orphanage. "
"Frasier: You can still send money to the children. "
"Niles: As usual, you've missed the point. I'm being shut out. It's as if someone snuck into my world and changed all the locks. "
"Frasier: Oh, Niles. Well, at least you don't have to worry about that tonight. After you. "
"Niles: Evening. "
"Usher: Tickets, please. "
"Usher: Oh, I'm sorry sir, these aren't for this performance. "
"Niles: What? "
"Frasier: What? But they say for the sixteenth, that's the sixteenth right there, that's today. "
"Usher: Yes sir, they were for the matinee. "
"Niles: Oh, no, no there has to be some mistake, let me just... Oh, dear God. "
"Frasier: I'm so sorry, Niles. "
"Niles: Well, surely you must hold some tickets aside for emergencies. We'll take anything, anything at all. "
"Frasier: Yes, even mezzanine. "
"Usher: If you like, you can try your luck in the cancellation line. "
"Niles: How could this happen? I have to see this play. I have to have people see me see this play. If I'm not seen seeing this play, you see... "
"Frasier: Niles, Niles, Niles I will make a simple phone call and we'll get house seats for tomorrow night, all right? "
"Niles: I suppose so. Come on, let's go. The last thing I need is for someone to see us loitering out here like gutter riff- raff pathetically scrounging for last minute tickets. "
"Frasier: Good luck "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Oh, Niles. "
"Niles: Hello, I know I'm a bit early, I was hoping we could get a bite to eat before the theater. "
"Frasier: Actually, Niles... "
"Niles: Yeah, yeah, it'll be on me of course, as a thank you for getting those replacement tickets. "
"Frasier: Yes, about the tickets... "
"Niles: I know, I owe you money. And my gratitude. And if I keep talking, you won't be able to tell me you weren't able to get the tickets. "
"Frasier: Just haven't been able to get them yet... "
"Niles: Oh, I KNEW you wouldn't get them "
"Frasier: Niles, please. "
"Niles: Oh, and now it's too late. It's six o'clock. "
"Frasier: Please, just calm down. I've made a few well placed calls, I haven't heard back from a couple of people. Someone will call. "
"Niles: Well, someone better call. Because everyone who's anyone is seeing this play. And you know who you are if you're not anyone? You're NO ONE. And I've been someone much too long to start being no one now. "
"Martin: Oh, hey, I thought no one was here. [Niles begins to throw another fit] "
"Frasier: Niles, please, just relax. One way or another, we are going to get tickets to this play. "
"Martin: You two still going on about those tickets? If this play is any good at all, in a coupla years they'll do it down at the dinner theater and you can get a nice prime rib with it. "
"Frasier: Dad, you don't understand. You see, this isn't just about the play. This is literally our last opportunity to see one of the finest actors of our time. "
"Martin: You just want to go 'cause all your snobby friends are goin' and you don't want to feel left out. "
"Niles: What we want is to sit at a theater and share a transcendent experience. "
"Martin: That nobody else could get tickets to. "
"Frasier: Of course. That's the transcendent part. "
"Frasier: Hello? ... Yes, I'll hold. It's Cleo Fenwick. "
"Niles: Cleo Fenwick? "
"Frasier: Yes, you remember her, she's on the board of the theater. You've seen "
"her: bad eye-job, dowager's hump you could cross the Sahara on. Hello, Cleo, you lovely thing. Uh-huh. Oh, well, you're a dear for trying. Thanks. Oh, don't despair Niles, I'm getting another call. Hello? Yes, Dora Yes, uh-huh. Too bad. Well, thank you. Yeah, oh, that is a wonderful idea, yes I will Thank you, bye-bye. "
"Niles: She has a lead for us? "
"Frasier: Yes, she said I should call Cleo Fenwick. "
"Niles: This is hopeless. "
"Frasier: Niles, there is another way. "
"Niles: You don't mean... "
"Frasier: Yes. I know it's a calculated risk. It is a little uncertain. "
"Niles: You can't be serious. It's unthinkable. "
"Frasier: Niles, what other choice do we have? "
"Niles: But the indignity, it reeks of desperation. "
"Martin: Now, now, before you do anything desperate, at least go stand in the cancellation line. "
"Niles: What did he think we were talking about? "
"Niles: Oh no it's Stephen and Susan Kendall. Quick, turn around. If they see us here, we'll be ruined. They know everybody. "
"Frasier: Yes, I know. Their Sunday brunches are a Who's Who of Seattle's elite. "
"Niles: I think it's safe. No one saw us. "
"Roz: Hey, Frasier Niles "
"Frasier: Roz. What are you doing here? "
"Niles: And how did you get tickets? "
"Roz: Oh, a friend of mine couldn't use hers, so she gave them to me. I asked my cute new dentist, he's a big fan of Sir What’s-his-face. "
"Frasier: You refer to the world's greatest living actor as... "
"Niles: Now, now, Frasier. Roz may not be familiar with Sir Trevor, but I'm sure she'll enjoy the play. I trust you got good seats? "
"Roz: Ooh. I think so. Row C? "
"Niles: Row C. Excellent. Look, a whole bunch of naked men. "
"Roz: What are you doing? "
"Niles: Give me those, you philistine You don't even know his name "
"Roz: Are you crazy? ' and let go of "
"Rob: Ready to go, Roz? "
"Roz: Yes. "
"Niles: Dr. Mandell? "
"Rob: Oh, hi, Niles. "
"Roz: You two know each other? "
"Rob: Sure. How's the teeth bleaching going? "
"Niles: Fine, thanks. "
"Roz: Let's go, Rob. It's a long way to row C from the cancellation line. "
"Rob: Hang in there, guys. I wouldn't be surprised if you get lucky. "
"Niles: I'd be stupefied if you didn't. "
"Frasier: I knew you were bleaching them. "
"Niles: Oh... "
"Frasier: 'No, really, I just changed toothpastes.' "
"Susan: Is that Niles Crane? And Frasier. "
"Frasier: Oh, Susan. "
"Niles: Stephen. "
"Susan: We're seeing everybody tonight. It simply... oh, dear. You're not waiting for a cancellation, are you? "
"Niles: Is that what this is? "
"Frasier: I feel just... Look at us. Blocking these poor unfortunates who couldn't get tickets. "
"Seller: I got one pair left. Who's next? "
"Usher: Curtain going up. "
"Frasier: Curtain going up, shall we? "
"Seller: Next in line, please. "
"Susan: Niles, you coming? "
"Niles: I, uh... "
"Frasier: You'll have to forgive my brother. You see, he's too ashamed to admit he's just waiting for one last cigarette. It's all right, Niles, you go right ahead, I'll just see the Kendalls in. "
"Niles: OK. "
"Stephen: Thank God, another smoker. Darling, maybe I'll just stay and have a cigarette with Niles. "
"Seller: Do you want these tickets, sir? "
"Niles: Me? Oh, oh, no, no [He steps aside for the next people in line.] "
"Susan: Stephen, please. I'd really like to sit down. "
"Stephen: All right. Niles, we'll make a date. I'll meet you right here at intermission and we'll have a smoke. "
"Niles: Oh, right here is where I'll be. "
"Frasier: Enjoy. "
"Susan: See you later. "
"Frasier: Well, this is just perfect. Not only are we missing the play, but now we have to hang around here until intermission, so they don't catch on to us. "
"Niles: Oh, what are you complaining about? I'm the one who has an hour to learn how to smoke. "
"Frasier: Niles They're coming out. Come on, let's blend in. "
"Frasier: Niles, what are you doing? "
"Niles: I'm practicing. I haven't held a cigarette since I played Duke Mantee in our junior high production of 'The Petrified Forest.' "
"Frasier: Yes, I remember watching you from the petrified audience. Come on. Oh, there they are, let's go. "
"Stephen: Oh, well, you got out here quickly. I guess you needed one of these more than I did, huh? "
"Niles: Yes, well, when you enjoy smoking as much as I do, noth... "
"Susan: Oh, bye-bye. Feel better, I'll call you. "
"Stephen: The Gornleys. Kendra isn't feeling well, Richard is taking her home. Oh, there's Mikki and Lyle. "
"Susan: Poor old dears, they could only get balcony. "
"Stephen: Still, we should say hello. They are your parents. Excuse us. "
"Niles: My God, these things are turning me green "
"Frasier: Never mind that, Niles. The Gornleys are not coming back. Let's go sneak into their seats and watch the second act. "
"Niles: Let's go "
"Usher: Your ticket stubs, please. "
"Frasier: Oh, I beg your pardon? "
"Usher: Well, I'm sorry, we've had some people try to sneak in after intermission. "
"Frasier: Well, you know, I think we, I left our coats in our seats and our stubs are in the coats. "
"Usher: Oh, don't worry about it. [They turn to head in, but are stopped again.] We'll just have someone bring your coats to you. Where are your seats? "
"Frasier: I'll...have to check the seating chart. "
"Stephen: Aren't you going in? "
"Frasier: Well, yes, yes, my brother just needed to have one last cigarette. "
"Susan: Oh, you're worse than Stephen. "
"Frasier: Yes, really, Niles, I do wish you'd quit. I'm begging you. "
"Niles: I just wish I didn't love the damn things so much. [He lights up.] "
"Frasier: Yes, well, if we don't see you after, have a lovely evening. "
"Susan: Actually, we're having a small supper at Le Chanteuse afterwards for Sir Trevor. So if you're not busy, say around eleven? "
"Susan: Good, we'll see you then. "
"Niles: Frasier Dinner with Sir Trevor, that's better than seeing the play "
"Frasier: Niles, are you insane? We know absolutely nothing about the damn play How can we possibly talk with this man? For God's sake, I just wish I'd read that review in yesterday's paper. "
"Niles: Do you still have it? "
"Frasier: I might. Dad lets the papers pile up for days sometimes. You know what? We've got just enough time to go there and get back. Let's go "
"Stephen: Where are you going? "
"Frasier: See, I told you it was the other way. "
"Frasier: God "
"TO: "
"Martin: What's goin' on? "
"Frasier: Dad, we're looking for yesterday's paper. "
"Martin: Oh, well, it should be there. "
"Frasier: Oh Dad That review you were reading yesterday, 'Tears of the Mariner.' Do you remember it? "
"Martin: Kinda. "
"Frasier: Just "
"concentrate: What was the play about? "
"Martin: Well, let me see, uh, it started out with this old guy who was guttin' a fish. And then he gives this fish to his son, but his son rejects it. "
"Frasier: Good Good, then what? "
"Martin: Uh...oh, yeah Well, then it turns out he's got this fatal disease, and the next thing you know, he's in this big stadium. And he's telling everyone that even though he's dying, that today, he considers himself the luckiest... "
"Frasier: Dad That is 'Pride of the Yankees' "
"Martin: Oh, yeah, that's right. I'm sorry, I'm sorry about that. But I'm pretty sure that fish part was right. "
"Niles: Yes, yes Here it is "
"Frasier: Let me "
"see: 'Trevor Aimsley's bravura performance in 'Tears of the Mariner' qualifies him as an...' Yes, blah blah blah, blah blah blah, continued on page A-sixteen. "
"Niles: Where is it? "
"Frasier: Daphne Her picture must have been on the other side. It may still be here, she was going to mail it to her mother. "
"Niles: Daphne's picture was in the paper? "
"Frasier: Yes, well someone snapped a candid photo of her in the park. If you ask me, it was not her most flattering angle, but I'm sure you would disagree. "
"Niles: Well, open it. "
"Frasier: Carefully... Oh, what the hell, I'll buy her flowers. "
"Daphne: Hey, Dr. Crane, I thought you went... Is that my letter? "
"Frasier: Daphne, let me explain... "
"Daphne: No, no, I should have known I'd never get any privacy in this house. "
"Frasier: You don't understand. I just wanted to... "
"Daphne: You just wanted to find out if I was gossiping about you to my mum. Well, fine I was. A seventy-three year old woman in Manchester is about to find out that you dye the grey out of your temples. There You happy? "
"Frasier: No, I am not happy, I am mortified How did you know that? I keep my hair dye in the false bottom of my cufflink box. "
"Daphne: Yeah, well... I'll let it go this time. "
"Frasier: Oh, we haven't got time for this We've to get down to that party "
"Niles: I knew you were dyeing your hair. "
"Frasier: Shut up. "
"Niles: 'No, no, really, it's just my new conditioner.' "
"Frasier: Shut up "
"Frasier: Whatever you do, don't get specific about the play. That's the mistake you made last year when you lied about having seen 'The Silent Echo.' All that yammering on about how the play had third act problems. It fooled no one. "
"Niles: What makes you so sure? "
"Frasier: Well, for starters, 'The Silent Echo' doesn't have a third act. ' He bows "
"Trevor: Thank you. Double scotch, no ice. "
"Bartender: Yes, sir. "
"Susan: Frasier, Niles, how nice. Sir Trevor, this is Dr. Frasier Crane and his brother Dr. Niles Crane. "
"Frasier: It's an honor. "
"Susan: Two of our city's preeminent psychiatrists. "
"Niles: Huge fans. "
"Frasier: Huge, yes. "
"Susan: They've set up a table for us in the private room, shall we? "
"Trevor: No, I'll just finish this and be right along. Perhaps the two doctors will keep me company. I'd love to hear a psychological interpretation of the play. "
"Susan: All right, but don't be too long. "
"Trevor: So, tell me, as students of the human psyche, did my character ring true? "
"Frasier: Oh, oh yes. So true. "
"Niles: I can honestly say I never saw a false moment. "
"Trevor: Well, what about the third act? The play clearly has a third act problem. "
"Niles: Well, at least it has a third act, unlike 'The Silent Echo' which really could have used one. [Frasier gives him a dark look.] "
"Trevor: I quite agree. I did 'The Silent Echo' in London, last year. What did you think of the hat scene? [Frasier now gives Niles a cheery 'What now?' look.] "
"Niles: The hat scene? Well, you know, the most important thing about the hat scene, and I have to stress this... oh dear God, is that clock right? I have to call the sitter and tell her I'm going to be late. The children worry so. "
"Trevor: Well, back to the play. "
"Frasier: Right. Well, you, of course, were brilliant. "
"Trevor: Oh, please Dr. Crane, I just want your professional analysis of what you saw tonight. "
"Frasier: Well, it, uh... of course I could discuss subtext, metaphor and imagery with you, but you see, I, I come to the theater to feel. To be moved, and that is exactly what happened to me tonight. "
"Trevor: Really? When? "
"Frasier: When? Well, let me see...uh, um, well, there was that, uh, the gutting the fish scene. You make the most heart-breaking gesture... It was, uh, you know, the one with, with your hands... "
"Trevor: Oh, you mean when I offer the fish to my son and he turns his back to me and I reach out to him like this? "
"Frasier: Yes, it's even more moving the second time. Well, who knows why a, a moment like that touches us so. You see, that is your gift, Sir Trevor. You've given us hundreds of moments. Moments so real, so compelling that we are revealed in their truth. "
"Trevor: You don't know how refreshing this is. To meet someone who doesn't just come to the theater, but who gives himself over to it. That crowd in there, they only come because it's fashionable. They don't care about art. I can spot them at a "
"glance: the poseur, the fraud. Oh, here comes your brother. "
"Niles: Kids are fine. "
"Trevor: Oh. "
"Waitress: Excuse me Sir Trevor, they're waiting for you in the dining room. "
"Trevor: Ah, very well. And thank you, Dr. Crane, for your integrity and your passion. You are the reason that actors act. "
"Niles: Well, I'm sorry I deserted you but obviously you carried the day. Bravo "
"Frasier: Oh, yes, bravo for us "
"Niles: What do you mean? "
"Frasier: Do you realize what we missed tonight? A potentially life-changing experience in the theater. And why? Because we were too embarrassed to be seen in a cancellation line. "
"Niles: You're right. What were we thinking? Kowtowing to a group of snobs like that. "
"Frasier: We weren't thinking. Come on, let's get out of here. "
"Susan: Frasier, Niles. "
"Frasier: Oh, Susan, I'm so sorry, but we can't stay. "
"Susan: Oh, no. Sir Trevor will be so disappointed. He was quite taken with you. "
"Frasier: Well, send him our apologies. It really was wonderful to meet him. "
"Susan: I know this is short notice, but if you're free this weekend, we're having one of our Sunday brunches. Senator Logan is coming and Maria DeFalco and the Whitneys... "
"Frasier: Yes, but I'm afraid that we... "
"Susan: Oh, please try. I'll hold it open for you. Check your books and let me know. "
"Frasier: Well, how's that for irony? "
"Niles: Sunday brunch at the Kendalls'. An hour ago we would have leapt at that invitation. "
"Frasier: Not anymore. We've got a damn sight too much integrity. Although... Are we being selfish? "
"Niles: Possibly. How? "
"Frasier: Here's my thinking. Why do shallow people remain that way? The lack of positive influence. "
"Niles: Perhaps our brand of integrity is just what that group needs. "
"Frasier: Yes We can be like those politicians who try to change the system from within. "
"Niles: Exactly. And who knows? Maybe it'll rub off on Senator Logan, he'll bring it back with him to Washington. "
"Frasier: Well now we HAVE to go. "
"Niles: What are you wearing? "
"Frasier: I'm going to wear my new Prada suit. "
"Niles: Oh, you're a fashion plate and a patriot. "

"Customer: Dr. Crane. I just wanted to tell you how much I miss your show. "
"Frasier: Oh, well thank you so much. I miss it too. Yes, the brisk interchange of ideas, the crackling interplay between me and my callers. "
"Customer: Uh-huh. "
"Frasier: Well, you're very kind. "
"Frasier: See that, Roz? The public still craves the kind of excitement that only Frasier Crane can provide. Roz "
"Roz: I am so sorry. The baby kept me up all night long last night. I'm trying to get her used to her crib, but she just hates to sleep alone. "
"Frasier: Well, the acorn certainly doesn't fall far from the... "
"Roz: I have GOT to wake up. I'm on my way to an interview. I mean, I'd kill for a cup of regular coffee, but I'm still nursing so I can't. You know, it was all I could do just to get myself dressed and then feed the baby this morning. "
"Frasier: Yes, you know, next time maybe you should try feeding first and dressing second. [He points to a large stain on her blouse.] "
"Roz: Oh, my God How did I miss this? "
"Frasier: Well... on the plus side, it does divert the eye from the blueberries in your teeth. "
"Roz: What? I can't go to this interview like this. "
"Frasier: Of course you can. "
"Roz: Oh, I'm just gonna call and cancel. "
"Frasier: No, no, no, Roz, please Just check your teeth, put your jacket on and I swear you'll look every inch the smart career gal on the go. There. "
"Roz: Thanks, Frasier. "
"Martin: Hey, Roz. Is that the newest thing, wearin' two different shoes? "
"Roz: "
"Frasier: Hi, Dad. So, what brings you here? "
"Martin: Well, I thought you needed a little cheerin' up. You've been kinda mopey lately. "
"Frasier: Well, I had kind of a rough night at the wine club. During the blindfolded tasting, I gave four stars to a Mexican Zinfandel. "
"Martin: Well, I don't just mean last night. You've been kinda down ever since you lost your job, you know? And you haven't had a date in I don't know how long. "
"Frasier: Yes, well, I know how long, and this isn't the way to cheer me up. "
"Martin: Well, don't worry, I found a girl for you. Now, Duke's daughter Marie just moved back in town... "
"Frasier: Dad, blind dates remain the refuge of the lovelorn. "
"Martin: You know, if you didn't talk like that you might not have to get set up so much. Now listen, she's not a blind date, you know Marie, you spent a week with her at the lake. "
"Frasier: She was six years old "
"Martin: Well, Duke said she's grown into a real looker. "
"Frasier: Yes, well I have SEEN Duke, and unless he sired a love child with Catherine Deneuve, I don't like my odds. "
"Marie: Uncle Martin. "
"Martin: Oh, Marie Look at you You remember Frasier. "
"Frasier: Bonjour. "
"Marie: I don't know when I've had such a delicious meal. You really made this dessert yourself? "
"Frasier: Well, yes. A little something I like to call 'Crane Brûlée.' "
"Frasier: Is everything all right there? "
"Marie: Oh, it's just a little quirk of mine. I like to keep things straight. You know, in parallel lines. "
"Frasier: Yes, I noticed that earlier with the asparagus. "
"Marie: It's weird, I know. It used to drive my mother crazy. "
"Frasier: Oh, we all have our little idiosyncrasies. How is your mother, anyway? "
"Marie: Still in my face. After the divorce, things just got worse. Oh, I'm doing it again, aren't I? I'm sorry, I'll stop. Look. [She deliberately places a spoon at an odd angle.] Anyway, I haven't figured out how to have a normal relationship with her. "
"Frasier: Well, you know, we're all striving to have what we call 'normal relationships,' but who really knows what normal is? You can move it back now. "
"Marie: Thank you. "
"Frasier: What do you say we have our wine out on the balcony? "
"Marie: The balcony? "
"Frasier: Yes, you haven't had a chance to see the view. "
"Marie: Oh, wow That is some view all right Beautiful. "
"Frasier: You're afraid of heights, aren't you? "
"Marie: I'm taking classes. They give us these exercises to do, they just work better when you're standing on a little milk crate. Oh, I must seem totally neurotic. "
"Frasier: Not at all. "
"Marie: I guess I'm going a little nuts since I moved back in with my dad. Thank God I'm getting my own place next week. "
"Frasier: Yes, I suspect that will help a lot. You know, very often, the key to mental health is distancing ourselves from our parents. "
"Martin: I'm home Oh, hey, sorry to barge in on you kids. "
"Marie: That's all right, why don't you join us for dessert. "
"Martin: Oh, thanks anyway, but I had 'Crane Brûlée' for lunch. "
"Frasier: I had to do a little dry run earlier, wanted to make sure my caramelizer wasn't on the fritz. "
"Martin: Yeah, I was pretty proud the first time he brought that blow-torch home. 'Til I saw what it was for. "
"Frasier: Dad "
"Martin: No, no, I'm only jokin'. She knows that. He's a great kid, Marie. Sure, he's out of work now, but he's hit the skids a lot of times, but he always manages to bounce right back up. "
"Frasier: I think you've spread enough pixie dust for one evening, Dad. Thank you. "
"Martin: Yeah, yeah, well, goodnight you two. "
"Marie: I should probably get going too. "
"Frasier: All right. "
"Marie: Thank you for a great evening. And for all the wonderful advice, it was very insightful. "
"Frasier: You're quite welcome, Marie. Perhaps you can offer me a little insight as "
"well: will this be our only night together, or will I see you again? "
"Marie: Well, you're pretty good at interpreting things, maybe this will answer your question. "
"Frasier: Oh. Well, then you have a nice life. "
"Marie: ...and just as this hunter catches up to me, and is about to kill me, I wake up on the cot in my dad's oak-paneled rumpus room. "
"Frasier: That is a terrifying nightmare. Are there any other figures in the rumpus room? "
"Marie: No, that's not part of the dream. I really sleep there. "
"Frasier: Oh, oh. "
"Marie: I wish I didn't have to go. Can we talk more about this after the museum tonight? "
"Frasier: Oh, of course. I thought it was the opera tonight. "
"Marie: No, the museum opening. You promised me in the shower this morning, remember? "
"Frasier: Yes, well I was under duress. You had a loofah to my head. "
"Frasier: Oh, Niles, you just missed Duke's daughter. "
"Niles: I saw. Is it possible that's the same little girl that we used to refer to as 'The Ugly Dukeling'? She is stunning. "
"Frasier: Isn't she, though? You know, the insecure part of me is having trouble figuring out why she's going out with me. She could have her pick of men. And I am a little older, haven't been to the gym as often as I should, and you can feel free to contradict me anytime you like, Niles. "
"Niles: You must have something, because she's clearly charmed by you. "
"Frasier: Yes, well, whatever the reason, we certainly have the most wonderful time together. We have the greatest discussions. Oh, I've been helping her sort through some of her issues. "
"Niles: Oh, really? "
"Frasier: Yes, it's a very complex relationship with her mother, giving rise to several striking phobias, recurring dreams, the most charming little obsessive-compulsive disorder. "
"Niles: Oh, well, there you go Perhaps she's attracted to you because of your psychiatric expertise. "
"Frasier: What are you suggesting, Niles? That Marie is going out with me just to get free therapy? "
"Niles: Well, it was just a thought. "
"Frasier: It's a mean-spirited thought Marie is not using me. She would want me just as much even if I weren't a psychiatrist. You know, you're jealous You're jealous that I'm having sex Jealous that I'm having hot, passionate, sweaty jungle sex What are you having? "
"Niles: I'm having a latte. "
"Martin: Will this be all right for ya? Yeah, I'm telling you, Phil, she's really cute. You'll see for yourself in a coupla minutes. Oh, wait, she's comin' in now, I gotta go. "
"Martin: Hey, Daphne, how's it goin'? "
"Daphne: Fine. "
"Martin: Good. "
"Daphne: What are you so chipper about? "
"Martin: Oh, nothin'. It's a beautiful night out. Say, why don't you come out and have a look at the moon with me? "
"Daphne: Why? Is it full? "
"Martin: I don't know. "
"Daphne: All right. "
"Martin: Beaut, isn't it? "
"Daphne: Oh, yeah, very romantic. "
"Martin: Oh, now, wait come here. I gotta show you somethin' else. Over here. Ah, look at that, the way those moonbeams bounce off that reflecting pool. "
"Daphne: Ah, yeah, that's really something. What are you doing? "
"Martin: Nothing. "
"Daphne: Yes, you are. "
"Martin: No, I'm not. "
"Daphne: Yes, you are. "
"Martin: I'm not. "
"Daphne: Yes you are, you're signaling to someone. "
"Martin: Oh, all right. I did such a good job with Frasier, I thought maybe I could fix you up with some nice guy. "
"Daphne: Is it that man up there with the binoculars? "
"Martin: Yeah, isn't that a great building? He does real well, he owns half that floor. "
"Daphne: Oh, Mr. Crane "
"Martin: What? "
"Daphne: I don't believe it Putting me on display like a bloody concubine "
"Martin: Well, you get a turn too. I got this telescope set up so you can have a look at him. [The phone rings.] See, he likes you Hello? Yeah, well I told you she was pretty What do you mean, can I show you another one? What do you think I'm running here? "
"Marie: So there I am, actually biting the fingernails of the same hand that's holding the phone not two minutes after I'm on with my mother. Isn't that so revealing? "
"Frasier: Well, yes, I'd say it is. "
"Marie: Is everything OK, Frasier? You seem a little quiet. "
"Frasier: No, no, I was just so enjoying our museum chat and I was wondering how we got onto the subject of mothers. "
"Marie: Well, it was a Whistler exhibit. "
"Frasier: Yes, yes, I'm sorry. I guess I'm just a bit tense. "
"Marie: Well, why didn't you say something? I can give you a little massage. "
"Frasier: Oh, really, well all right. If you think that will help. "
"Marie: It's such an amazing feeling, being in the presence of so much beauty. "
"Frasier: Yes, well you say that now, in six weeks you'll be telling me to lose weight. The Whistler, I know, I know. Gosh isn't it great that we both enjoy art so much? I could just talk about it all night. "
"Marie: Me too. "
"Frasier: Oh, you know, I couldn't help notice you staring at that riverscape. You couldn't take your eyes off it. "
"Marie: I think it's because it reminded me of my recurring dream. You know, we were going to talk more about that. "
"Frasier: Oh, yes, yes. The dream, being pursued by the hunter and the arrows... "
"Marie: Yeah. "
"Frasier: Well, uh, you know, I don't really feel like I'm up to talking about that now. Do you think we can do it some other night? "
"Marie: All right. What did you think of the riverscape? "
"Frasier: Oh, well, I, uh, I enjoyed it. I was also enjoying what you were doing just now. "
"Marie: Oh, I'm sorry. My hands were just getting a little bit of a cramp. "
"Frasier: Oh, well then let me do you, then. "
"Marie: Actually, it's getting late. You know, maybe I should get home. "
"Frasier: I thought you were gonna spend the night. "
"Marie: I'd like to, but I have an early morning and I hate to rush. Had a great evening tonight. "
"Frasier: You know, about that dream, uh, I did have one thought. "
"Marie: Really? "
"Frasier: Yes. Forest imagery...very often represents our most primal emotions. Hence its frequent use in fairy tales. Which could be a link to your childhood. "
"Marie: You are so good at this. Much better than my therapist. "
"Frasier: You have a therapist? "
"Marie: Not anymore. Who can afford it? Anyway... You know, my hands are feeling much better, why don't we give that massage another shot? So I notice that I often have this dream right after I talk to my mother. Oh, your muscles are so tense Is it just your neck, or is it all over? "
"Frasier: It's all over. "
"Roz: Frasier Frasier You will not believe this Little Alice said her first word today. It was 'Ma.' Or it may have been 'moo.' Mary, that's the sitter, gave her this little toy cow. She's always doing stuff like that. I love Mary. I love this little cow, too. It's the cutest little thing, it's brown and white, well that's a jersey cow, right? Well that's where Mary's from, Jersey. Yeah I'll take a splash more You know, I stopped nursing yesterday and boy have I missed this stuff. Cup of mud, java, my old friend Joe - Oh, that's funny, Mary's husband's name is Joe. Oh, my God, he's picking her up, I gotta go, this has been fun, you look great, nice talking with you. "
"Niles: Frasier, may I join you? "
"Frasier: Well, of course, Niles. And I'm sorry about yesterday. "
"Niles: No, no I'm the one who should be apologizing. I never meant to suggest Marie was... "
"Frasier: Niles, Marie and I broke up. "
"Niles: I'm sorry. Did she at least give you a reason? "
"Frasier: I broke up with her. But thank you for the daily shot in the arm of confidence. "
"Martin: I just talked to Duke. What the hell did you break up with Marie for? "
"Frasier: Dad, listen, I'm terribly sorry. I don't mean to cause a rift between you and your friend, but I couldn't continue with it. You see, once I confirmed that Marie was primarily interested in me as a sounding board for her problems, I just had to end it. Just as Niles suggested I should. "
"Niles: I never suggested that No, all I said was that one of the things she might appreciate about you was your psychiatric expertise. For heaven's sake, if you were a world-class chef, she'd appreciate your cooking, if you were a stand-up comic, she'd appreciate your jokes. "
"Martin: If you were a dermatologist, and she had a big growth comin' out of her face... "
"Frasier: Yes, Dad, I get it. "
"Niles: I am sorry, but if you had let the relationship continue, she might have found other things that she'd appreciate about you just as much. "
"Frasier: You know, maybe there's still time to win her back. "
"Martin: Well, it'd take a pretty big bouquet of flowers to do that. "
"Frasier: I don't know, Dad. Maybe if I just explain to her what really happened, she'll forgive me. Sometimes the best apology is just the truth. "
"Niles: You mean you're going to tell her you thought she was prostituting herself for therapy but now you've decided that's OK? "
"Frasier: Well, not that truth. Some other truth. "
"Frasier: Evening Dad. "
"Martin: Hey, you two. How was dinner? "
"Marie: It was just great. We went to my favorite restaurant. It's this little Korean barbecue. "
"Frasier: Yes. It's just fabulous. You get to cook your own food on this little grill that's right in the center of the table. It splatters a little bit, but you know, that's what makes it fun. "
"Niles: Clearly you had a marvelous time. Oh, hello again, Marie. "
"Marie: Hi, Niles. If we're gonna go away this weekend, I should make reservations. "
"Frasier: Right. I tell you what, just use the phone in my bedroom and I'll be in in a minute. "
"Marie: Actually, just thinking about getting away is making me more relaxed already. "
"Frasier: She has a little problem with heights. "
"Niles: I saw that. "
"Martin: Well, I'm sure glad you two patched things up, anyway. You know, Duke and I go back a long way. I got a lot of friends but there's somethin' I get from Duke that I don't get from anybody else. "
"Frasier: Seahawks tickets. "
"Martin: And don't think that SOB wasn't ready to pull 'em, either. "
"Niles: Dad dragged me to one of those Korean barbecues once. Had that suit dry-cleaned three times, Eddie still greets me in a carnivorous frenzy every time I wear it. "
"Frasier: Yes, well the next time Marie and I go out to dinner, I'm going to pick the restaurant. Preferably, one where the stove gets its own room. "
"Niles: Well, she certainly seems smitten with you. "
"Frasier: Yes, she certainly does, doesn't she? And I am quite captivated with her. You know, I can't put my finger on exactly why. "
"Niles: Well, I'm just glad things are going well for you. "
"Frasier: Are they ever. I find her more enchanting each day. You know what? And I am particularly intrigued by this recurring dream she has. She's in the woods, she's being pursued by a hunter and get this, when she turns to confront her pursuer, the hunter has no face. "
"Niles: Fascinating. "
"Frasier: Well, I'm determined to get to the bottom of it. I'm certain it could shed light on her mother issues, and this fear of heights and, oh God, I just discovered that she absolutely refuses to touch a doorknob with her bare hand. Thanks to my natural chivalry, I missed that for a whole week. "
"Niles: Uh, is that all you talk about, her problems? "
"Frasier: Well, no, no, we talk about lots of things. Art, the theater, why? "
"Niles: Oh, it's just a passing thought. "
"Frasier: Well, pass it over here. "
"Niles: Well, you were asking what most captivated you about her. Perhaps she's giving you a chance to exercise your psychiatric muscles. "
"Frasier: What? "
"Niles: Well, you have been out of work for a while... "
"Frasier: Niles, Marie is a stunning woman with a body to die for, and you think all I'm interested in is her mind? How shallow do you think I am? "
"Niles: Well, there's no need to get defensive. There's not a problem. Unless, she's falling in love with you and you're only interested in her as a case study. "
"Frasier: I assure you I'm interested in all aspects of Marie, not just her psyche. For God's sake, you know I could happily go for weeks without discussing it once. "
"Niles: Glad to hear it. "
"Frasier: Well, thank you. If you'll excuse me, I have someone waiting for me in the other room. "
"Frasier: Oh, oh, dear God Unhand me you wretch Oh, you vile creature Oh, for God's sake, you miserable mutt Niles, please Throw him a Liv-A-Snap Get off of me "
"Frasier: Just let go of that leg, you, this instant "
"Frasier: My father's best friend. Well, after your father. "
"Marie: We're all booked for this weekend. There's a lake, hiking, sounds like the perfect place to relax. [He hands her a glass of wine and climbs on the bed with her.] "
"Frasier: You know, I do love the country, so relaxing. I swear to God, I am out like a light as soon as my head hits the pillow. "
"Marie: Then we'll have to ask for a room with no pillows. Oh That reminds me, I had that dream again. But this time I saw the hunter's face. "
"Frasier: Really? "
"Marie: Yeah. You'll never guess who it was. "
"Frasier: Who? No, no. "
"Marie: What? "
"Frasier: Well, you know, I'd just really rather not discuss the dream right now. "
"Marie: Oh, you're right. I'm sorry. Like you even care about who the hunter is right now. "
"Frasier: Yes, when there's so many other things I'm interested in. There, that's better isn't it? "
"Marie: Yeah. "
"Frasier: You feel relaxed? "
"Marie: Uh-huh. "
"Frasier: Was it your sister? "
"Marie: What? "
"Frasier: The hunter. It was your sister, wasn't it? "
"Marie: No. I thought you didn't want to talk about this. "
"Frasier: Oh, God, you're right. I don't. I really, really don't. I'd much rather be exploring other things right now, like your lips. And your chin. And your neck. "
"Marie: Ohh, keep going. "
"Frasier: Oh, for God's sake, who was it? "
"Marie: What is with you? "
"Frasier: I just have to know. "
"Marie: OK. It was me. "
"Frasier: Of course it was The hunter represents your feelings of anger and abandonment that you've been running from ever since your parents' divorce Until now, you've been able to avoid those painful areas, sometimes hiding in the forest of repression Now, your willingness to identify the hunter signals that you are now ready to, to reintegrate these complex emotions into a more cohesive self "
"Marie: Wow It's all so clear now "
"Frasier: It certainly is "
"Marie: That was amazing. I am so glad I gave you a second chance. "
"Frasier: Oh, Marie, I... "
"Marie: Please, don't apologize. Maybe someday it'll be some funny story we tell our grandkids. The time grandpa broke up with grandma. "
"Frasier: Actually, grandma... "
"Marie: Yes? "
"Frasier: I'm afraid this isn't gonna work. "
"Marie: What? "
"Frasier: Us. I'm afraid that... "
"Marie: Wait a minute. Am I crazy, or are you breaking up with me again? "
"Frasier: Well, they're not completely unrelated. You see, you are a beautiful young woman and I have really enjoyed tackling some of these issues with you, it's just that I don't think that's the basis for a relationship. I think you deserve someone who appreciates all you have to offer. "
"Marie: I don't believe this. "
"Frasier: I just feel more like your therapist than your boyfriend. "
"Marie: But I thought we were having such a good time together. "
"Frasier: I'm afraid our time is up. "
"Martin: This weekend's game? Well, yeah, I want 'em, Duke... Seahawks - Chiefs? Are you kidding? I'll pick 'em up tomorrow. Hey, wouldn't it be a kick if we wound up in- laws? "
"Marie: Go to hell "
"Martin: Oh, hold on a sec. "
"Frasier: Good, embrace the anger, it's the best way to mental health. "
"Marie: I don't need health tips from you, you quack. "
"Frasier: Well, I think you've made real progress in the time we've been together. "
"Marie: Oh, don't flatter yourself. "
"Frasier: I have the name of a specialist. "
"Marie: Call him yourself "
"Martin: Hey, Duke, I'm gonna be kinda busy tomorrow, uh, maybe you could just drop those tickets in the mail right now so you don't forget. "

"Frasier: I just had the most wonderful time today. "
"Nancy: Me too. It's funny that we worked together all that time and we never dated before this. "
"Frasier: Well, anyway I... "
"Roz: Hey, Frasier Nancy, hi "
"Nancy: Hi "
"Roz: So, are you back to work yet? "
"Nancy: Almost, I start at KNFS tomorrow. "
"Frasier: You know, Roz, Nancy and I are having coffee. "
"Roz: Oh, none for me, thanks. Listen, can I have a fat-free muffin please? Nancy, I have been dying to call you. My cousin just moved to town and I think he'd be perfect for you "
"Nancy: Actually, I just started seeing someone. "
"Roz: Well, you'll forget all about him when you meet Chuck. He is so handsome and rugged and he loves the outdoors... "
"Frasier: Kindly leave him there. You see, the person that Nancy is seeing is me. "
"Roz: Really? You two are dating? "
"Frasier: Even as we speak "
"Roz: Oh, my God I am so sorry. Well, good for you. I mean, who needs Chuck when you've got... well, the anti-Chuck? When my muffin gets here, could you send it over? "
"Frasier: You won't even see it coming. "
"Roz: OK... "
"Frasier: Well, where were we? "
"Nancy: Well, I think you were about to ask me out again. "
"Frasier: My gosh, so I was. Well, let's just see how far this ESP of yours "
"goes: what night was I thinking of? "
"Nancy: Friday night. "
"Frasier: Astonishing Busboy, clear these spoons before she starts bending them. "
"Niles: Frasier, I am so glad you're here. "
"Frasier: Niles. "
"Niles: Oh, sorry. Niles Crane. "
"Nancy: I think we've met. Nancy Cavanaugh, I used to work at KACL. "
"Niles: Oh, of course. Talking business? "
"Frasier: Uh, well, actually no... "
"Niles: Oh, good, I was afraid I was interrupting something. Here, feast your eyes on this [He hands Frasier a document.] "
"Frasier: 'Financial Settlement.' Good lord, Niles, you and Maris have come to terms? "
"Niles: What's that? I couldn't hear you over the angels singing. "
"Frasier: Well, congratulations That is exciting. My, ah, brother's been going through a rather rancorous divorce. "
"Nancy: You must be very relieved. "
"Niles: Oh, I'll say. It's cost me a fortune already. If she dragged it out any longer, I'd be literally bankrupt. "
"Frasier: Well, I'm sure you've got some celebrating to do, so off you go. "
"Niles: I cannot wait until I'm done with this. I just have to sign it and get her to do the same and then I can take my seat aboard the freedom train. "
"Frasier: Well, all aboard "
"Niles: Oh, it's a funny "
"thing: one day you're starting a new relationship, full of hope. The next you're sinking helplessly into a sucking pit of despair that leaves you filled with the bitter bile of regret. "
"Niles: You're on a date, aren't you? "
"Frasier: It's hard to say at this point. "
"Niles: Oh, I am so sorry. "
"Nancy: It's all right, I have to go, anyway. It was nice seeing you again. "
"Niles: Yes, you too. "
"Frasier: What the hell is wrong with you? "
"Frasier: Well, here we are. "
"Nancy: So, are we still on for Friday night? "
"Frasier: Yes, of course we are. You know, I was wondering...maybe we could just, uh... "
"Nancy: Have dinner at your place? "
"Frasier: Yes, that's amazing. You read my mind again. "
"Nancy: Well, I just thought it would be more comfortable. We could curl up on the couch, make a nice fire... "
"Frasier: Can you guess what I'm thinking now? "
"Frasier: Oh, you ARE good, aren't you? "
"Martin: Hey, guys. "
"Frasier: Hey there. "
"Daphne: So, who won the squash game? "
"Frasier: Oh, Daphne, it's not about winning or losing, it's about the thrill of the competition. "
"Martin: Congratulations, Niles. "
"Niles: Thanks, Dad. Pumped as I was, I don't think anybody could have beat me today, even an actual athlete. "
"Frasier: Sherry, Niles? "
"Niles: Yes, thank you. Maris and I have reached a financial settlement. "
"Martin: Oh, ho That's great "
"Daphne: This is wonderful Well, as wonderful as the tragic ripping apart of two lovers once bound in a sacred union can be. Oh, it's brilliant, Dr. Crane. "
"Niles: Thanks Daphne. "
"Frasier: Oh, Daphne, as long as you're doing the laundry, let me throw in my gym towel. "
"Daphne: All right. "
"Frasier: You know, if you've got a couple of extra minutes, I can also give you these squash togs. "
"Daphne: Oh, let's save some of the fun for tomorrow. "
"Frasier: What's this? Cartier Niles, did you put this in here? "
"Niles: No. "
"Frasier: My goodness, someone must have slipped this in my bag while we were in the courts. That's odd, I don't remember anyone touching our bags except the valet and Jaime, the squash porter. "
"Martin: Boy, you guys work up quite a sweat down there, don't you? "
"Frasier: Oh, my goodness, Niles, look at this. Cufflinks They're beautiful. There's a card in here. 'I still think of you constantly. I was wrong to ever let you go. Do you believe in second chances?' It's unsigned. "
"Martin: Wrong to let you go. It sounds like it's from someone who dumped you. "
"Daphne: Well, that's no short list, is it now? "
"Martin: You know, maybe it's that Sonya woman he was goin' out with. "
"Daphne: Wasn't there a sister, too? "
"Martin: And a niece "
"Niles: Oh, yes, he went through that family like a recessive gene. "
"Frasier: Yes, well, not to disrupt the think-tank, but there is an easier way to find out. I'll just make a few well-placed inquiries and see where I get a nibble. [He gets his address book out of the desk.] Ah, yes, there's a group of people that might regret leaving Club Frasier before last call. Oh, yeah, Patricia and there's oh, Susan, yes. Tatiana, oh boy... "
"Niles: Frasier, all during squash the only thing you talked about was this wonderful new woman in your life, now you're just going to drop her to chase after someone else? "
"Frasier: I'm not dropping Nancy I'm just, uh, I'm uh... "
"Daphne: Weighing your options? "
"Frasier: Well, all right, so what if I am? "
"Niles: I don't believe this "
"Frasier: Niles, all of my life, I've dreamt of the day when I would be pursued by more than one woman. What man hasn't? For God's sake, do you blame me for enjoying it now that the day is here? "
"Niles: Well, all of my life I have heard you whine about your dating woes. Now you have a chance for something good with Nancy and you're going to risk ruining it? "
"Frasier: Oh, you are just jealous, that's what you are. "
"Niles: I am not jealous. You're being foolish. "
"Frasier: Oh, come on. Nonsense. "
"Niles: Dad, what don't you agree with me? "
"Frasier: Oh, fine, let's just ask Dad. Dad what do you think? "
"Martin: Noooo, no. Don't drag me into this. I learned when you were kids to stay out of it whenever you two started fighting. I'd just wait 'til the whole thing ended, usually in tears, then I'd take you both out for ice cream. That was my "
"job: ice cream man. "
"Daphne: I suppose fathers are the same everywhere. Mine couldn't bear to see us fight. If there was so much as a peep out of us, he'd be out the door to the pub. Stay for a few hours, sometimes overnight. Then, when they brought him back the next morning, we couldn't fight because of his headaches. I suppose that was part of his plan to keep harmony in the family. God bless him. "
"Niles: Oh, Daphne, wait up. I'll ride down with you. Frasier, you have a chance for something real with Nancy. Only a fool would throw that away chasing after some- "
"Daphne: It's here "
"Niles: Oh, wait for me -pie in the sky. "
"Frasier: What an idiot. Tatiana. Frasier Crane here. Pick up if you're there. Well, I guess I've missed you. Question "
"is: have you missed me? "
"Roz: Oh, hi Frasier. "
"Frasier: Hi, Roz. Why so glum? "
"Roz: Why else? The weekend's starting again and I don't have a date. "
"Frasier: Oh. "
"Roz: Do you know how long it's been since... you know. I've probably forgotten how. "
"Frasier: Oh, Roz, I'm sure it will come back to you. It's just like riding a bicyclist... bicycle. "
"Roz: Well, you're in the same boat, why don't you come over and hang out with me and Alice tonight? I'll rent a movie and we can order pizza... "
"Frasier: Gosh, I'd love to, but I've got a date tonight with Nancy. "
"Roz: That's still goin' on? "
"Frasier: Yes, as a matter of fact, we're going out tonight on our THIRD date. You know the "
"kind: it's like one of your FIRST dates. "
"Roz: Oh, ha-ha. Well, I gotta go. "
"Frasier: All right. "
"Waitress: You're Dr. Crane, right? "
"Frasier: Yes, I am. Can I help you? "
"Waitress: A woman dropped this off for you. "
"Frasier: Oh, my gosh, it must be another gift from my secret admirer. "
"Roz: You've got a secret admirer? "
"Frasier: Yes, I do. In fact the other day, she sent me these cuff links. At least, I think it's the same woman, unless a third person has thrown her hat in the ring. "
"Roz: Oh, my God. You have two women? "
"Frasier: At least. "
"Roz: And you're juggling them? And you're getting jewelry? "
"Frasier: Why is that so hard to believe? "
"Roz: Well, I guess since they cloned that sheep, anything's possible. "
"Martin: Hey, Roz. "
"Roz: Hey, guys. "
"Martin: Hey, Fras. "
"Niles: Hey, Frasier. "
"Frasier: Dad, Niles "
"Niles: What is that? Oh, not another gift from your mystery woman. "
"Frasier: Yes, yes, indeed it is. Oh, my God. It's a Patek Phillipe pocket watch "
"Niles: That is stunning I almost bought one like that on my honeymoon, only Maris thought it was too impractical, so we got that Glockenspiel instead. "
"Martin: So, who do you think this stuff is from? "
"Frasier: Gosh, I haven't smoked her out, yet, but she certainly has exquisite taste. She doesn't have a bad eye for jewelry either "
"Martin: He was like this last night. It was all I could do to keep my beer down. "
"Frasier: Well, looky there. No, not yet. That's Tina Dalton. We dated last summer. And now it turns out she's in the cafe just as this little bauble arrives... "
"Niles: Frasier, before you go over there... "
"Frasier: Niles, please, I have had enough of your finger wagging. I am doing what any red-blooded American man would do. For God's sake, there's nothing wrong with playing the field. "
"Niles: It looks like you've been eating the field. What did you have for lunch? "
"Frasier: Pesto. Oh, my God I better go freshen up. "
"Martin: Huh. Look at this mess. Ah, it's too bad it's not bubble wrap. Ha You don't know what funny is until you've seen Eddie go after a sheet of that stuff. Poppity-pop-pop-pop He gets all scared and runs away, and then he screws up his courage and comes back again, and - poppity-pop-pop - he runs away again. Yeah, I watched him for an hour one time. You know, it's amazing how entertained he can be by somethin' so simple. Poppity-pop- pop-pop "
"Niles: Oh, my... "
"Martin: What is it? "
"Niles: This card that came with the gift. Frasier must not have noticed it. 'Missing you every moment, my dear sweet Niles.' Do you realize what this means? "
"Martin: Well, yeah. You're the one with the secret admirer. "
"Niles: And a pretty nice watch, too [He opens the case to look at it.] "
"Martin: Well, I don't get this, how could this happen? "
"Niles: Well, the other gift was left in Frasier's squash bag, which is exactly like mine. And, I guess today the waitress must have mistaken Frasier for me. You don't suppose it's Daphne? "
"Martin: Yeah, she took a second job washing that old Mrs. Lumpkin's hair just so she can give you Cartier. Besides, the note said it's someone you've been with. "
"Niles: There's been so few women since Maris. So few women before Maris. Hence there was Maris. "
"Martin: I'll bet it is Maris You said yourself you saw that watch on your honeymoon. "
"Niles: Oh, that's absurd. Dad, we're in the process of finalizing our divorce. "
"Martin: Excuse me, miss? Do you remember the woman who brought this box in? "
"Waitress: Yeah, she was very well dressed and really, really thin. "
"Niles: That could be a lot of people. "
"Waitress: Yeah, she just dropped off the gift then ordered a whole- milk mocha with whipped cream and chocolate shavings. "
"Niles: Oh, thank God. That's not her. "
"Waitress: Yeah it was really weird, though. She just took a long whiff of it and then just handed it back. "
"Niles: Well, thank you Marta, you've been very helpful. [he disconnects] Well, turns out Schenkman dropped Maris and now she wants me back again. "
"Frasier: Well, that was fun Had a little catching up to do, but it turns out she wasn't the woman sending the gifts. "
"Martin: Yeah, we know, the gifts are from Maris. "
"Frasier: Maris? Is my secret admirer? "
"Niles: No, she sent them to me. Schenkman dumped her and, and she wants me back. "
"Martin: How do you feel about this? "
"Frasier: Well, frankly, I feel a little injured. I thought I had a secret admirer. Well, no matter, I do have a date with Nancy, tonight. You know, it's our third date. "
"Martin: I was talking to Niles. "
"Frasier: Oh. Oh. "
"Niles: I guess I'll just have to go over and talk to Maris and set her straight. "
"Frasier: Gee, Niles, I don't know if that's a very good idea. "
"Niles: Well, I'm up to my ears in debt. I need to sign this settlement and she'll never do that if she thinks there's any hope of us getting back together. "
"Frasier: Gosh, it just seems a little dangerous to me, confronting her when she's so vulnerable. Don't you agree, Dad? "
"Martin: Don't ask me, I'm just the ice cream man. "
"Frasier: Well, thanks a lot. Listen, Niles, I think this whole pursuit of you has been brought on by a panicked reaction to Schenkman dumping her. You know, give her a few days, she'll probably realize that herself. That's the time to approach her. "
"Niles: I can't wait any longer. Do you have any idea how insulting it is that she thinks she can buy me back with these trinkets? I am THIS close to being free from her financially and emotionally I'm going to settle this right now. [He heads out.] "
"Frasier: Niles, I just think you should wait Well, he certainly dashed out of here in a hurry. I suppose that's a good thing. "
"Martin: Yeah, he's not gonna back down. "
"Frasier: That, and he forgot these cuff links. I've got a date tonight "
"Frasier: Oh, Daphne, thanks again for taking Dad to Niles's for me. I'd do it myself, but since you're going out... "
"Daphne: I'm going to a party three floors down from here. "
"Frasier: Gosh, I'm so sorry. I had no idea. I didn't mean for you to miss any of the fun. Dad Shake a leg, Daphne's in a hurry. You know, frankly I'm really glad he's going over there. I have no idea what condition Niles'll be in after he confronts Maris. "
"Daphne: Yeah, it's a shame about Dr. and Mrs. Crane. Seems so difficult these days to make something last. To find someone to grow old with and share all of life's little details. I only hope someday I find that kind of intimacy. "
"Frasier: Oh, I'm sure you will. "
"Martin: Daphne, where the hell is my scarf? "
"Daphne: In your sleeve, like it always is. Now come on, we've got to get going, there's construction by the waterfront. "
"Martin: Oh, we're not goin' that way. We're takin' my shortcut. "
"Daphne: I know your shortcuts and the waterfront's faster. "
"Martin: Now don't start with me. "
"Daphne: Don't YOU start with me or I'll leave you here. "
"Martin: Oh, hi, how ya doin'? Come on in. And we're turnin' on my radio station in the car. "
"Daphne: Fine, it's better than listening to you talk. "
"Nancy: Is this a bad time? "
"Frasier: No, that's a bad time. Hi. "
"Nancy: Hi. "
"Frasier: You look sensational. "
"Nancy: Thank you, so do you. "
"Frasier: Oh, thank you very much. Can I interest you in a glass of wine? "
"Nancy: Perfect. "
"Frasier: Lovely. "
"Nancy: I've been here before, you know. Two years ago, for your Christmas party? "
"Frasier: Really? "
"Nancy: I don't remember this chair. "
"Frasier: Normally there's something draped over "
"it: my father. "
"Nancy: Oh, there's a message on your machine. "
"Frasier: Must have come in while I was cooking dinner. "
"Nancy: I only mentioned it because I gave my secretary your number so she can call me about tomorrow morning's conference, in case, you know, I don't find my way home tonight. "
"Frasier: Oh, you just reverse the directions I gave you earlier... ohhhh. Feel free to check the machine if you like, I'll just go stir the risotto. "
"Cheryl: Frasier, this is Cheryl returning your call, and no- "
"Cheryl: I didn't send you anything. I thought I told you when we broke "
"up: It's over. "
"Frasier: Boy, is that old message still on there? Cheryl and I broke up so long ago, I can't even remember when. "
"Machine: Friday, six fifty-one PM. "
"Frasier: I know it was a Friday. "
"Nancy: Oh, well, we all have exes. As long as it's over. It is over, right? "
"Frasier: Oh, God, yes, it certainly is over. Oh Nancy, please here, come sit with me. Listen, I want to tell you I'm not interested in anyone but you. [The phone rings.] You know, perhaps I'd better get that, it could be your secretary. "
"Nancy: Oh, let the machine get it. "
"Denise: Frasier, it's Denise. I don't know how you got my number, but I am NOT interested in dating you again. "
"Frasier: Denise Ha, ha, you prankster. No. No, no, I won't. No, absolutely not. I promise, never again. Well, how about that dinner, now? "
"Nancy: I don't believe this. You have been calling other women for dates How could you lie to me? "
"Frasier: I haven't lied to you. Why would I lie to you? I have nothing to hide. [The phone rings and Frasier pushes her aside to get it.] Let me get that Hello? Yes? Oh, yes, just a moment. It's your secretary. "
"Nancy: Hi, Gwen. Call me in the car in five minutes. I'm going home. "
"Frasier: No No, Nancy, Nancy, please, please don't be hasty. I realize I've done something rather foolish. Look, let me explain. "
"Frasier: Nancy, the truth is, I did call some other women. I guess I was feeling insecure, a little nervous about getting close to you. I don't blame you for getting angry and I wouldn't blame you if you wanted to leave. It's just that I, I think we really have something here. "
"Nancy: Well, I thought we had something, too. "
"Frasier: I made a mistake. I... give me another chance? "
"Nancy: Well, that risotto did smell good. "
"Frasier: OK. "
"Madeline: Frasier "
"Frasier: Oh, Madeline. "
"Madeline: I got that note you left under my door. "
"Frasier: I am so sorry about that... "
"Madeline: I was so happy to hear from you. "
"Frasier: Really? "
"Madeline: I was just thinking about you the other day. You know, I don't even remember why we stopped seeing each other. "
"Nancy: What is going... This again? This date is over. "
"Madeline: Wait a minute. You slipped a note under my door and you were on a date with her? "
"Frasier: Well, you heard her. Technically, this date is over. "
"Nancy: Don't ever call me again. "
"Madeline: Or me, you freak "
"Frasier: Nancy, Madeline, please give me a second chance - either one of you "
"Martin: So then Daphne takes a left on Madison. Bumper to bumper all the way to Pike. Then a right on Pike. And what do you know? King Dome traffic So I say... "
"Niles: Dear God, this is taking forever "
"Martin: Exactly So, here we are on Fifth... "
"Niles: Wait, wait, don't go away I'm coming. Oh, Frasier. "
"Frasier: I have just had one of the worst experiences of my life. "
"Martin: You took Madison, didn't you? You're as bad as Daphne. Now what you should have done... "
"Niles: Oh, let it go Please come in. How was your date? "
"Frasier: Well, Nancy discovered that I had been pursuing other women. "
"Niles: How did she find that out? "
"Frasier: It wasn't hard. You see, I pursued one during the date. "
"Niles: Well, I'm sorry. "
"Martin: Yeah, so am I, Fras. "
"Frasier: Well, thanks, guys. I just, I should have listened to your advice, Niles. How did things go with Maris? "
"Niles: I wish I knew. I returned the gifts and told her there was no chance of reconciliation. She didn't get mad. In fact, she was eerily calm. She just stood there with a blank stare on her face, rubbing her ocelot. "
"Martin: You know, they got a cream for that. "
"Frasier: You know, maybe she'll come around. You've given her a lot to digest. "
"Niles: Oh, no. "
"Frasier: What is it? Oh, dear God. "
"Niles: I don't believe it I thought I made myself perfectly clear. What is wrong with that woman? "
"Martin: Why don't you start, Frasier? I'll jump in when you get hoarse. "
"Niles: 'Roses are red, your heart is fickle. When I'm through with you... all you'll have left is this nickel.' "
"Martin: Oh, no. "
"Niles: Oh, God... she's going to ruin me. "
"Frasier: No, no, Niles, maybe she's bluffing. You know, once she's signed the financial settlement... "
"Niles: She's not bluffing. This IS the financial settlement. Oh, Frasier, why did I go over there? Why didn't I listen to you? "
"Frasier: Why didn't I listen to you? If I had I'd be sitting with Nancy right now, sipping wine in front of the fire. "
"Niles: I'll be stripped clean and devoured like an animal. "
"Frasier: And I WON'T be. "
"Martin: All right, now. Enough of these long faces. Who wants ice cream? "

"Martin: You know where we should go tonight? Frannie's Fish & Chips "
"Frasier: Dad, we're taking Niles out to boost his spirits, not his cholesterol "
"Martin: Oh please, that French food that you guys eat is full of butter and cheese. "
"Frasier: Yes, but at least it's not made by a woman working a deep fryer in a batter-dipped brassiere. "
"Martin: Hey, isn't that Niles? "
"Frasier: Where? "
"Martin: Driving that old hatchback. "
"Frasier: Nah, Niles would never be seen in anything called a hatchback. But it does look a lot like him. "
"Frasier: Oh my God, he's running away "
"Martin: Well, catch him, Mr. 12-cylinder German engineering "
"answers: "
"Niles: Hello? "
"Frasier: Niles, what the hell are you doing? "
"Niles: Well, I'm just pulling into my parking garage. You on your way? "
"Frasier: What are you talking about? You're driving up 2nd Avenue "
"Martin: You're in that little red thing. "
"Niles: No I'm not, you must be mistaking me for someone else. See you when you get here. "
"Martin: He's getting away. He just took a right at the corner. "
"Niles: Hello? "
"Frasier: Niles What are you running away from us for? I can see that it's you "
"Niles: No, you're mistaking me for someone else. "
"Frasier: That is ridiculous, I can hear my own horn through the phone "
"Niles: Frasier, I may lose the connection, I'm just stepping onto my elevator. I'll see you when you- "
"Martin: What's the matter with him? "
"Frasier: Maris repossessed his car, that must have been all he can afford. He's just ashamed to admit it. "
"Niles: Hello? "
"Frasier: Niles, do not hang up on me We know what's going on We're right behind you. "
"Niles: Alright, I was afraid this would happen - I was petrified someone I knew would see me driving this humiliating car It looks like some buggy derailed from a carnival ride, except this has no safety features. "
"Frasier: Oh Niles, you're worrying over nothing. What kind of person judges you by the sort of car you drive? "
"Niles: Mitsy Gill. "
"Frasier: Oh yes, she might, she drives a Bentley. "
"Niles: She's parking on the corner - she'll see me "
"Martin: Is everyone alright? "
"Niles: Dad, come quickly, I need your help. "
"Martin: Oh my God What is it? "
"Niles: I need you to get up here and pretend this is your car. "
"Niles: Oh, my shoulder is killing me "
"Frasier: Oh Niles, did you bang into the steering wheel? "
"Niles: No, I've been parallel parking all week without power steering. "
"Martin: Let me get you some aspirin. "
"Niles: Oh, thank you, Dad. Er, check upstairs in the bathroom of the study. Pardon the disarray, Frasier, I've had to cut the cleaning lady down to two times a week. "
"Martin: Yeah, looks like a bomb went off. "
"Frasier: I gather your financial situation's gotten a bit shaky. "
"Niles: Oh yes, every since I rejected Maris's attempts to woo me back, she's been quite vindictive She's frozen all the accounts Sherry? "
"Frasier: Thank you. "
"Niles: My salary isn't even covering my legal bills. "
"Frasier: Well, what do you lawyers tell you? "
"Niles: Well, mostly that my salary isn't even covering my legal bills "
"Frasier: You know, if this siege is going to continue you might have to tighten your belt a bit. Perhaps we should make up a list of your expenses. "
"Niles: Alright. But not with that pen. That once belonged to Noel Coward. I just purchased it. "
"Frasier: Well, it is stunning, Niles, but you know if you're going to be economizing perhaps you'll have to forego the decorative antique pens. "
"Niles: Could we at least review my list before making any drastic decisions? "
"Frasier: Very well. "
"Niles: That's my rent... that's insurance... "
"Frasier: You pay that much in rent? "
"Niles: Well, that includes the building newsletter. "
"Frasier: Well, it's outrageous "
"Martin: Niles, are you there? "
"Niles: You can't blame me for the housing market - this is a simple apartment "
"Martin: I'm in some room with a lot of books but it doesn't have a bathroom "
"Niles: Oh, that's the library, not the study - go down the hall, make a left. "
"Frasier: Well, this simple apartment of yours is going to bankrupt you You must admit it's a bit large for one person. "
"Niles: Oh, don't forget I have a pet. "
"Frasier: Are you saying that your BIRD requires both a study and a library? "
"Niles: All right, I will return the Noel Coward pen, but this is my home. This is a basic necessity. "
"Martin: OK, I've found the aspirin but I'm lost again. I'm in a blue room with big rolls of paper. "
"Niles: That's the gift wrapping room. Look for the stairs. "
"Martin: The only stairs I can find go up "
"Frasier: You have a THIRD floor? "
"Niles: It's practically a crawl space. Go out the door to the left. "
"Niles: Don't look at me like that I have to have a roof over my head "
"Frasier: Niles, you have three roofs over your head For God's sake, you have to come to your senses. Look at the numbers, they don't lie I'm afraid you don't have any choice. "
"Martin: Alright, now I'm stuck. How do I get down, there's a bookcase blocking my way. "
"Niles: Well, the bookcase is a secret door, Dad. "
"Martin: How do I open it? "
"Niles: Just poke 'Mrs. Dalloway' on the bottom. "
"Martin: What? "
"Niles: The yellow book on the lower shelf. "
"Martin: Oh, right "
"Niles: Frasier, every since I was a little boy I have walked by this building and wondered what sort of people could live in such a magnificent place. "
"Frasier: I know, Niles. "
"Niles: Getting in here after Maris dumped me proved that I was not a complete failure. "
"Frasier: I understand that. "
"Niles: And I have no choice, do I? "
"Frasier: I'm sorry. You know Niles, perhaps you should move before you're obligated for another month's rent here. You can stay at my place until you find something. "
"Niles: Thank you. "
"Martin: Here you go, you can get your own glass of water. "
"Niles: This aspirin's expired. "
"Martin: Well, it wasn't when I found it. "
"TO: "
"Daphne: Oh Dr. Crane, I'll clean up. "
"Niles: Oh, not necessary. "
"Daphne: You've been cooking dinner every night, I hardly feel like it's my kitchen anymore. "
"Niles: Of course it's your kitchen... [Daphne puts something in the fridge] No, that doesn't go there I know it's probably a bit presumptuous of me to rearrange your kitchen for you but I promise you, you'll find it a lot more... "
"Niles: User-friendly... "
"Daphne: Where's my jar of Bovril? "
"Niles: Oh, the meat paste Well, I threw it out, it smelled rancid. "
"Daphne: Well, that's how it's supposed to smell - it's English "
"Frasier: Well, I'm off to bed Roz and I have a very important breakfast meeting with an important employer tomorrow. I can't burn the midnight oil like you, Dad. Dad "
"Martin: What? Oh all right, I'll get a coaster "
"Frasier: Dad, what is it with you? You could barely stay awake during dinner "
"Martin: Oh, you'd feel the same way if you shared a room with Niles. All night long, up and down, shifting and tucking. "
"Frasier: Well, if it's really annoying you that much, I'll just move his cot into my room. "
"Martin: Oh "
"Frasier: At least one member of this family can show some compassion. "
"Martin: Well, good luck Last night I got up and went to the bathroom – when I came back he'd made my bed "
"Time: 7"
":15) "
"Frasier: Will you be much longer? "
"Niles: Almost done. "
"Frasier: I only ask because Roz and I have this very important job interview tomorrow, I'd like to be well rested. You've been in there for twenty minutes "
"Niles: No I haven't. Now I have You should try this marvelous new facial feel, it's like getting ten years back "
"Frasier: What about the last half hour? "
"Niles: It's going to be so much fun bunking together like when we were kids. "
"Frasier: Oh yes, it's all coming back to me now. "
"Niles: I just want to tell you again how much I appreciate your taking me in like this. Not every brother in your position would be so generous. "
"Frasier: Think nothing of it Niles, it's no trouble at all. ' Niles goes back to bed and puts on a "
"Frasier: Niles, what are you talking about? That's just more rain noise "
"Niles: No, it's much more than rain. This is all the sounds of the Brazilian rain forest. Does it bother you? "
"Frasier: No. Go to bed. "
"Frasier: Oh, for God's sake "
"Niles: Alright, alright, I'll switch over to babbling brook. "
"Niles: If you're feeling tense about that interview I can show you one of my breathing exercises. "
"Frasier: No, no Just some sleep will do. "
"Frasier: Oh, for God’s sake, Niles "
"Frasier: What the hell happened? "
"Niles: Isn't it obvious? You blew a fuse. "
"Frasier: You haven't seen anything yet "
"Niles: Ow "
"TO: "
"Roz: Listen, I know he's on his way, he must have got the address wrong. I knew I should have picked a place he's been to before. "
"Draper: I'm sorry, I'm afraid I have to... "
"Roz: Oh, please don't leave. Let me just try his cell phone. "
"Draper: Very well. "
"Roz: Hello Frasier, it's Roz. You sound terrible, where are you? The emergency room? Oh my God His appendices burst No, no, don't apologize. It's not your fault. We'll just reschedule it... "
"Frasier: I'm so sorry I'm late "
"Draper: "
"Frasier: Mr. Draper, you're not leaving, are you? "
"Draper: I have another meeting and I don't like to keep people waiting "
"Roz: I'm going to kill you "
"Frasier: Roz, please, I'm so sorry. "
"Roz: Where the hell have you been? "
"Frasier: Blame Niles, he kept me up so late last night I slept right through my alarm. "
"Roz: What's he still doing there, hasn't he found a place yet? "
"Frasier: No, no, he's sublet his apartment at the Montana. He has to find something furnished. There just aren't many out there. Still, he's looking every day "
"Roz: Not yesterday. "
"Frasier: What do you mean? "
"Roz: I saw him outside the cinema waiting in line for 'Lawrence Of Arabia.' "
"Frasier: Well, that's impossible, he told me he had appointments all day "
"Roz: Frasier, I know Niles when I see him. How people go to the movies with their own seat cushion? "
"Frasier: You mean he hasn't even been looking? "
"Roz: I don't know, ask him yourself. "
"Frasier: Niles. "
"Niles: Frasier. "
"Frasier: Off for another day apartment hunting? "
"Niles: Yes. I hope I see as many as I saw yesterday, covered the whole waterfront. "
"Frasier: Well, then you must have seen the one on Crawford and Pike? "
"Niles: Yes, I think so. "
"Frasier: White with blue trim? Right next to the market, couple of flags upfront. "
"Niles: Yes It looks nice from the outside but it's completely unsuitable for living in. "
"Frasier: Oh yes, I imagine so, seeing as it's a Chevron station You saw nothing Nothing yesterday, probably nothing in the last two weeks. You've been going to the movies. "
"Niles: That is an outrageous lie "
"Frasier: Roz saw you and your seat cushion. I was feeling sorry for you while you were lying to me the whole time. "
"Niles: I'm sorry, after the first day I just couldn't look anymore. I'll never find anything tolerable in my price range. It's barely tolerable having a price range. "
"Frasier: All right Niles, well today I'm going with you. It may be the only way you'll find a place. "
"Niles: Oh, you make it sound as if I plan to stay with you forever "
"Frasier: Well, I did notice you put a bottle of '93 Pechie Beron on the grocery list last night. "
"Niles: So? "
"Frasier: That wine's not even drinkable for two years "
"TO: "
"Frank: An' we got a rec room too And did you see the hot tub? "
"Niles: If you referring to that six-man petri dish, yes. I think we're about finished here "
"Frasier: Niles, we can't leave without seeing the apartment. Frank was kind enough to put on pants to bring us up here. "
"Frank: Welcome to the 'Shangri-La' "
"Frasier: Oh Niles, it's... magnificent "
"TO: "
"Frank: I think you'll see why the Shangri-La is so popular with bachelors like yourself. "
"Niles: I'd assume it was that charming 'NO CREDIT NO PROBLEM' banner out front. "
"Frank: Here's your kitchen. All modern. Looks like the previous tenant left a four-slot toaster behind. "
"Frasier: Isn't that something, Niles? You can make yourself a club sandwich and still have a slice left over for guests "
"Niles: Oh well, I think I've got the lay of the land. "
"Frasier: Wait, we haven't seen the bedroom yet. "
"Frank: Oh, right this way "
"Frank: Looks like he left the sheets behind too. "
"Frasier: Well, how's that for convenience? No dust bunnies under that bed, no sir-ee That is a vacuumer's dream, that is. Well, let's have a look at this closet space, shall we? "
"Frank: Oh sorry, I thought Gary's sister was supposed to pick this stuff up. Well, help yourself. "
"Niles: This Gary certainly seems to have left in a hurry. Did he leave no forwarding address? "
"Frank: Uh, he left a note, but... nooo. No address Well, take your time. "
"Niles: NOW can we go? "
"Frasier: No, Niles, not before we have a look at this... [opens cupboard to a fold-down ironing board] this very charming little ironing board here. "
"Niles: You're sure that's not the guest room? "
"Frasier: Niles, listen, I know this isn't what you had in mind but we have scoured the city, I'm afraid this is the only thing we're gonna find. "
"Niles: Well, I want to keep looking, there's no rush. "
"Frasier: Well, actually... "
"Niles: What? "
"Frasier: Niles... "
"Niles: Oh You want me to move out. I've overstayed my welcome, I see. "
"Frasier: No, it's time to understand that your circumstances have changed. You are going to have to adapt. "
"Niles: I don't want to adapt. I want to go home "
"Frasier: Niles... you are home "
"Niles: Well... where are my manners? Can I get you some toast? "
"TO: "
"Daphne: Well, I'm off. Oh, your brother called - he said he won't be joining you for your wine club tonight. "
"Frasier: Really? That's a first. "
"Daphne: You know, it's funny how much Eddie misses that bird of Dr. Crane's. This morning a pigeon landed on the terrace, Eddie jumped up excited, ran over and started barking at it "
"Frasier: Oh, yes he does that all the time. "
"Daphne: No, no, this was a different sort of bark, "
"like: 'You're not my bird Don't fly over here and get my hopes up like that You're not my bird' It was silly and sad at the same time, you know? "
"Frasier: Firsthand. Niles say why he cancelled at all? "
"Daphne: No. "
"Frasier: You know, I just hope he's not depressed. I keep picturing him sitting in that dreadful apartment all alone. I guess I should have let him stay here a little longer until he found something nicer. "
"Daphne: Oh, I'm sure as soon as he's got his books on the shelf and his opera playing he'll be fine. You have nothing to feel guilty about. "
"Martin: Oh Fras, your antiques scout brought over that Noel Coward pen you bought. "
"Daphne: Noel Coward pen? Like the one your brother's got? "
"Frasier: Oh, it is his He returned it and I pounced on it "
"Daphne: Dr. Crane's feeling bad about moving his brother out. "
"Martin: Oh come on, Fras. He's a big boy, you just gave him the push he needed. "
"Frasier: Well, he did need a push. "
"Daphne: Besides, I'm sure the place you've found him isn't as bad as all that. "
"Frasier: You're right, Daphne, it isn't all that bad. Yeah, once he's decorated it, it'll be much nicer. You're right, you're right. I'm being much too hard on myself. I'm sure he'll be perfectly happy in the Shangri-La. "
"Martin: You got him in the Shangri-La? That's where Duke stayed during his divorce. Oh, let me tell ya', that's my kinda place. "
"Frasier: What have I done? "
"Frasier: Hey, Niles "
"Niles: Dad Frasier Did you not get my message about the wine club? "
"Martin: Yeah, but we thought it'd be just fun to have a nice dinner. "
"Niles: Actually, I'm just on my way out. "
"Frasier: Where to? Bali H'ai? "
"Niles: No, they're having a ping pong tournament in the rumpus room and my neighbor, Jimbo, has invited me to be his partner, so let me just go and tell him I'll be a couple of minutes late. If you're thirsty they sent up some wine coolers in my welcome basket. "
"Martin: And you were worried. He's making friends, taking part in activities... "
"Frasier: Dad, he's obviously covering That shirt alone is a shriek for help "
"Martin: Is it so hard for you to believe that he can actually be happy? "
"Frasier: In this place? Yes "
"Niles: Oh, you should stay, the guys in D building are bringing over a six-foot sub and they've rigged the pinball machine so it's free play all night. "
"Frasier: Niles, you know I'm finding it a bit difficult to accept this newfound enthusiasm of yours. "
"Niles: Well, weren't you the one who told me that I should adjust to my new circumstances? "
"Frasier: Yes, but I'm just concerned that you're immersing yourself in this lifestyle just to avoiding feeling the pain you're going... "
"Martin: Oh, would you just leave the guy alone He's obviously having a good time "
"Martin: I'd be happy here myself - this is my kind of place. "
"Niles: Get me out of this hell hole "
"Martin: What did I say? "
"Niles: Oh, I can't live this charade I have tried, it's taking too much out of me. "
"Martin: Now Niles, this place is fine, and you know what they "
"say: 'What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.' "
"Niles: But Dad, not everyone makes it into that second group. And I've got the luau shirt to prove it. Alright, that's it, enough is enough. "
"Frasier: Niles, who are you calling? "
"Niles: I am calling Maris, I'm going to beg her to take me back. "
"Frasier: You don't want to do that "
"Niles: Oh yes, I do. "
"Frasier: Niles "
"Niles: Life with Maris wasn't so bad. It was my fault, after all I was too rigid, I was always making demands "
"Frasier: No, Niles "
"Niles: 'Eat something Unlock this door Don't throw that' "
"Martin: Niles, give me that phone. "
"Niles: No "
"Martin: You don't know what you're doing "
"Niles: Yes I do. "
"Martin: Just drop it and kick it over here "
"Niles: I won't I'm dialing, I'm pressing Send, it's ringing. [into phone] Maris I'm calling... I'm calling... "
"Niles: I'm calling to tell you that there's a new address for forwarding my mail. 62 Elm Street, Shangri-La Apartments. Thank you "
"Frasier: Well, good for you, Niles. "
"Niles: Oh, the second I heard her voice I knew I couldn't go back. But how am I ever going to live here? "
"Martin: Oh, it's just temporary, Niles. She can't drag this divorce out forever. "
"Frasier: You know, Niles, perhaps this place is the price you'll have to pay for your freedom. "
"Niles: Well, it's worth that. "
"Martin: Good, that's the way to look at it. So let's have a toast to that. "
"Niles: Thank you, Dad. You know, I never did sign my lease. I suppose now is as good as time as any. "
"Frasier: Niles, perhaps this will make it easier. [hands him the Noel Coward pen] A little housewarming gift. "
"Niles: Thank you. "
"Martin: Here we go. Here's looking at you kids "
"Frasier: You know, Niles, you may have to sleep here but you certainly don't have to eat here. How does Cigaré Volante sound? "
"Niles: Oh, music to my ears "
"Martin: I can't go in that place without a jacket. "
"Frasier: Well, you know what? Maybe we should poke through that closet, I bet Gary's got a jacket that'll match those pants. "

"Frasier: What a glorious day Can't help but put a bounce in one's step, can it? "
"Roz: If you're gonna be cheerful, sit somewhere else. Damn it I broke a nail. "
"Frasier: Here. "
"Frasier: Oh, hello, Niles. "
"Niles: If my life gets any worse, I'm phoning Hell to ask about their exchange program. "
"Frasier: Well, lucky me, I stumbled in at happy hour. "
"Frasier: Here. So, Niles, Maris at it again? "
"Niles: Oh, worse. It's so depressing I can barely talk about it. My gourmet club is holding elections to see who will win this year's Golden Apron... "
"Roz: Wait. I can see I'm gonna need a hanky for this. "
"Niles: Latte, please, to go. Normally, the finalists compete by giving lectures. I'd written mine, a waggish look at food fads of yesteryear entitled '"
"Fondue: What Were We Thinking?' "
"Niles: Suddenly last night, disaster. Someone proposed that instead of giving lectures, this year's finalists compete by hosting dinner parties in their homes. "
"Roz: So? Why don't you invite 'em all over and cook 'em a meal? "
"Niles: At the Shangri-La? I can't tell the cream of Seattle's gourmet set that I've moved out of the Montana and into that gulag with a game room. I'll just have to drop out of the race. "
"Frasier: Let's not be hasty. Let's give this some thought. Every problem has a solution. "
"Roz: Do you call that a problem? A problem is when your kid keeps you up three nights in a row with colic, and you're so burned out you rear-end a Lexus, with four passengers, each and every one a lawyer, so you'll probably be sued and spend the rest of your working life, if you ever even GET a job, lining the pockets of four blood-sucking, whiplash-faking fat cats. THAT'S what a problem is. "
"Frasier: Can you have it at a restaurant? "
"Niles: It's against the rules. "
"Roz: Thanks for the sympathy "
"Frasier: Well... "
"Niles: Sympathy for what? "
"Frasier: Oh, I don't know, she broke a nail. "
"Frasier: Anyway, Niles, try as I might, I can't think of a single thing. I'm sorry. "
"Niles: Well, don't blame yourself. Blame Claudia Kynock, the whole dinner scheme was her greedy notion. "
"Frasier: Claudia Kynock? Kevin's widow? "
"Niles: Can you believe it? She owns six newspapers and nine radio stations, she'll still cadge a free meal faster than that bulbous cartoon fellow who mooches hamburgers from Popeye. I know I must sound... "
"Frasier: Wimpy. "
"Niles: And whiny too. But... I wanted this. And after the year I've been through, I needed something to restore my pride, my dignity, my manhood. That Golden Apron could do it. "
"Frasier: And you are going to have it. You can have the dinner party at my house. "
"Niles: You mean it? "
"Frasier: Yes. I'll tell you "
"what: I'll rent an extra-large table and I'll share in the hosting chores. "
"Niles: You are a saint. "
"Niles: Though I did note you only offered after you found that out our club includes a rich station owner who could give you a job. "
"Frasier: Well, Niles, I must say I'm hurt. I offer you something out of the goodness of my heart, you make it sound like I'm a shallow opportunist. "
"Niles: I'm terribly sorry. How can I make it up to you? "
"Frasier: Oh, I don't know. Sit me next to someone interesting. "
"Niles: Oh, Claudia, perhaps. "
"Frasier: Yes. Put her on my left, it's my best side. "
"Pam: He actually marked the bottle so he'd know if you took some? "
"Daphne: Yeah. Then he marched into my room and confronted me with the evidence. I said 'All right. If you want to be such a miser, then fine, I'll buy my own bath salts.' "
"Martin: Oh, hi, Pam. I didn't know you were here. "
"Daphne: I told you this morning she was coming by. "
"Martin: It musta slipped my mind. Don't you look nice tonight. "
"Pam: You too, Martin. I love your sweater. "
"Martin: Yeah, pretty cheerful, huh? Not everyone can wear these colors. "
"Daphne: It helps if you're a matador. Come on, we don't want to be late for the movie. "
"Pam: Can I freshen up first? "
"Martin: Oh, yeah, yeah, right through there. "
"Daphne: You dirty old man Flirting with a girl her age "
"Martin: Well, she was flirting right back. I saw her giving me the once-over. "
"Daphne: Yeah, she looked once and it was over. "
"Daphne: You've never acted this silly with any of my other girl friends. What's so special about Pam? "
"Martin: Oh, nothing. She's just young and friendly, and... she reminds me of the girls I used to date back during the war. "
"Daphne: What, you mean Korea? Mr. Crane, it's not dating when you're an occupying force. "
"Martin: Well, just ask her if she's interested. "
"Daphne: Have you lost your mind? "
"Martin: Hey, the gals in Pyong Chang used to think I was pretty damn cute. "
"Daphne: Yeah well, this is a bit different. You're not twenty-one and her village hasn't just burned down. "
"Daphne: You're not going to get her with a kind smile and a Hershey bar. "
"Martin: Oh, just ask her, OK? "
"Daphne: You know, this explains that so-called 'mix-up' with those mail order videos. Mistake my fanny, you ordered 'The Joy Luck Club' "
"Frasier: Oh, hi Dad, Daphne. Pam, nice to see you. "
"Daphne: Good night, all. "
"Martin: Pam? "
"Daphne: Just keep moving. "
"Niles: What's with Dad? "
"Frasier: It's a Korea thing, don't ask. "
"Niles: Oh, my God He said yes, I've got him That was a message from Marcel DeBoeuf He's agreed to cater my dinner for the gourmet club. "
"Frasier: Oh, Niles, that is a coup. "
"Martin: Who? "
"Frasier: Marcel DeBoeuf, Dad. He's the famous sculpter-turned-chef. Each plate is a work of art. "
"Niles: He's doing his all-truffle menu. For the appetizer, he sculpts tiny mushroom trees, then he carves radishes to look like truffle pigs, snuffling around the roots. "
"Martin: Oh. Maybe I should do that for Eddie. I could mold his Alpo into a cow. "
"Niles: That reminds me... "
"Frasier: I got him Sonics tickets. "
"Martin: Bless you. Oh And did I mention, they're predicting meteor showers for that evening So not only will I have a great meal, in a perfect setting... "
"Frasier: Oh, Niles. "
"Niles: But we'll have nature itself putting on a show for us. [points out to the balcony] Oh, we'll have an excellent view from right... "
"Niles: Dear God, what's that? "
"Frasier: Well, it's just a small crack, a little bird flew into it the other day. I'm replacing the pane next week. "
"Niles: Next week? "
"Frasier: Yes. "
"Niles: Well, that's too late. "
"Frasier: It's just a piece of tape No one will even notice. "
"Niles: You have no idea how cutthroat my rivals are. They will leap on the tiniest imperfection. Last night, Sebastian Melmoth threw a lavish Japanese banquet. A certain rival spent the entire evening carping about how the obis on the geishas' kimonos were improperly tied. "
"Frasier: 'A certain rival?' "
"Niles: All right, me. "
"Martin: He had geishas? "
"Frasier: That's enough, Dad. "
"Niles: Well, I'll just have to have the party somewhere else. "
"Frasier: But Niles, you promised you'd have it here. You promised me Claudia Kynock. "
"Martin: Nobody's gonna notice that window, and besides, who else is gonna loan you their place? It's not like you can ask Maris. "
"Niles: I don't have to ask her. She's out of the country. She's in Antwerp having her elbows done. She has that stunning beach house. I'm sure I can get past the alarm. "
"Martin: Isn't that breaking and entering? "
"Niles: Oh, pish. It can't be a crime if it's catered. "
"Frasier: Well, Niles, I hope you have a lovely time. "
"Niles: Oh, don't sulk Frasier. You can still come. I've got to start planning. Wait 'til you see this place. It's right on the beach, it's ideal for viewing the meteor shower. "
"Martin: Maybe Chef Marcel can make your truffles look like little meteors zooming around the plates. "
"Niles: We make fun of him, but every now and then he has a fantastic idea. "
"Frasier: I hope you're right about the alarm code, Niles. People do change them. "
"Niles: Maris will never change this one. "
"Niles: It's her ideal weight. What she weighed at her debutante ball. Let's see, this many pounds, and that many ounces. "
"Frasier: Good lord, no one could weigh that and live "
"Gretchen: Maris "
"Niles: Oh no, not her. "
"Frasier: Neighbor? "
"Niles: Yes, Gretchen Kuntz. The old girl's been smitten with Maris ever since she taught falconry at Maris's finishing school. Here, put these in water and I'll get rid of her. "
"Gretchen: Maris, liebchen. Is that you? "
"Gretchen: Oh, Dr. Crane. "
"Niles: Hello, Gretchen. "
"Gretchen: I'm surprised to see you here. When last I spoke to Maris, she said your marriage had come to a timely end. "
"Niles: Yes, well, it's all patched up now, we couldn't be happier. In fact, that's Maris in the kitchen now. We're terribly busy. I'll be right with you, muffin But I'll tell her you looked in. "
"Gretchen: Do. Ask her to stop by. My wolfhound had puppies. "
"Niles: Let's get some lights on. "
"Frasier: Good lord, what the hell is that? "
"Niles: Maris had it made after she lost power in a storm. Battery operated, works on a clapper so you can find it in the dark. Only problem was, the poor thing, try as she might, she could never clap hard enough to activate it. "
"Frasier: Oh, Niles, this view is breathtaking You know, with a setting like this and Chef Marcel in the kitchen, I think that Golden Apron is as good as yours. "
"Niles: Well... "
"Niles: What is that revolting smell? "
"Frasier: It smells like it's coming from the beach. "
"Niles: Oh, it's like garbage or rotting fish... "
"Frasier: Or a dead seal. "
"Niles: No, it's more like a rendering plant. "
"Frasier: No, Niles. There's an extremely large dead seal right by this dinghy. "
"Niles: Oh, dear God "
"Frasier: You know, on the bright side, there's not a single crack in these windows. "
"Niles: Yes, Animal Control? A large seal washed up on my property, I need you to come remove it right away. Its condition? It's deceased. What? Oh, you're not serious. He says they only handle live seals. What kind of policy is that? If it were alive, I wouldn't need you, I could just scare it away myself. "
"Frasier: I'd pay to see that. "
"Niles: Oh, wait, I was mistaken. It's not dead after all, it's sitting up. It looks very disoriented. Come quickly "
"Frasier: Give me that. Hello, this is Frasier Crane. You may remember me from my radio show. "
"Niles: Oh, yes, that should send the Seal Mobile racing over here. "
"Frasier: Just how do you suggest we dispose of a dead seal? I see. I see. Charming. Well, we have two options. We can either bury it or haul it out to sea, in which case they suggest we stab some holes in it. "
"Niles: Stab holes in it? "
"Frasier: To make it less buoyant. "
"Niles: It would certainly make me less buoyant. Well, we'll have to bury it. Help me find a shovel. "
"Frasier: Right. "
"Niles: Oh, no. That's Chef Marcel. If he finds out what's out there, he will walk. "
"Frasier: Over a dead seal? "
"Niles: He won't let anything upstage his food. He stormed out of Kate York's christening party over an ill-timed diaper change. You let him in, I'll find a shovel. "
"Frasier: Right. "
"Frasier: Ah, Chef Marcel, this is indeed an honor. I'm Frasier, Niles's brother... "
"Marcel: Where is my kitchen? "
"Frasier: It's, uh, right through there. "
"Marcel: What is that smell? "
"Frasier: Uh, what smell? "
"Marcel: Is there a baby here? "
"Frasier: No. I mean, yes. Well, there was a baby, but it's gone now, and we can air the place out. "
"Marcel: Do. "
"Niles: Al right, let's do this. Quick, quick, quick. "
"Frasier: What's the matter, Niles, you couldn't find any demitasse spoons? "
"Niles: I'm sorry. This is all we have. "
"Frasier: Niles, for God's sake, it'll take us until doomsday with these things. Let's just stick it in the dinghy and haul it out to sea, come on. "
"Niles: I'm not touching that thing with my bare hands "
"Frasier: All right, just go find a sheet or something to wrap it in. "
"Frasier: Poor noble creature. At least in death, you've achieved a kind of tragic dignity. "
"Niles: We can wrap it in this. Quick, quick, quick. "
"Frasier: A peach peignoir? "
"Niles: Yes, and I found perfume. "
"Frasier: We're giving it a burial, Niles, not a day of beauty. "
"Niles: It's to cover the smell, and the peignoir was all I could find. The beds were all stripped, the linen cupboard's locked. "
"Frasier: All right, get on with it. "
"Niles: Do you think that helped? "
"Frasier: Oh, yes, Niles. It smells so lovely now it's almost a shame to bury it. Give me a hand with this. All right, OK, now let's turn it over. "
"Niles: Oh, have you ever seen anything so heartbreaking? That sullied nightgown, that cold vacant stare, those limp little whiskers... "
"Frasier: Stick a corncob pipe in its mouth, it could be Nana on Dad's side. Come on, let's go "
"Niles: Nice oarsmanship, Mr. Oxford Rowing Champ "
"Frasier: Well, it's not very easy to keep your balance when your crewmate jumps on your back and shrieks like a tea kettle. "
"Niles: Oh, I'm sorry. The thing's tongue lolled out and licked my ankle. I just hope the wind changes before the party, they'll be here in fifteen minutes. The stench is so strong. I could almost swear the damn thing was still... AH It's back "
"Frasier: Oh, my God, the tide must have washed it back in. I knew we should have taken their advice and stabbed some holes in it. "
"Niles: No. I refuse to even contemplate something so disgusting. We'll just row it back out, only this time we'll weigh it down with something. "
"Frasier: Oh, Niles, what about that hideous anchor lamp? "
"Niles: Perfect. We'll tie it to the peignoir's sash, it'll sink like a brick. Would you mind terribly doing that alone? "
"Frasier: Alone? "
"Niles: Yes, I have to get ready. Frasier, please, I beg you. "
"Frasier: All right, Niles. But the entire time I'm gone, you'd better be singing my praises to Claudia Kynock. "
"Niles: Done. "
"Marcel: Excuse me, where do you keep the... "
"Niles: Chef Marcel, it's so nice to meet you at last "
"Marcel: You have been swimming? "
"Frasier: Just a dip. "
"Marcel: In your clotheses? "
"Frasier: Well, it is November. You know, it was so refreshing, I think I'll go back for another. "
"Niles: Don't forget your lamp. "
"Frasier: Oh, yes, thank you. "
"Niles: It's getting dark in that water. "
"Niles: Sebastian, you must try one of these truffled scallops. "
"Sebastian: I'm allergic to bivalves, a good host would know that. "
"Claudia: Don't mind Sebastian, he's just afraid you'll outshine his geisha party. "
"Niles: Now, now, no rivalries, we're all friends tonight. And I'm sorry about the scallops. In the future, I'll try to cater more to your shellfish demands. "
"Sebastian: I got that "
"Niles: Oh, thank God you're back. I can open the deck? People are beginning to get suspicious. "
"Frasier: I hauled it out as far as I could. I just hope that lamp is heavy enough. Is Claudia here? "
"Niles: Yes, and she's dying to talk to you. "
"Frasier: Good. Smell my fingers. "
"Niles: Ooh, lovely. Tubla root? "
"Frasier: Jasmine. "
"Niles: Really? Everyone? As you may know, I've arranged a small meteor shower for our entertainment this evening. So feel free to claim your spots now on the observation deck. "
"Niles: Claudia. This is my brother Dr. Frasier Crane. "
"Claudia: Oh, well. Just the man I wanted to meet. "
"Frasier: Really? "
"Niles: Well, now I should warn you, Claudia's in radio, so you're probably in for more of that arm-twisting you've been getting from so many of those other station owners. "
"Frasier: Oh, my brother, the publicist. Before long, he'll be telling you about my two SeaBeas and my Broadcaster of the Year award. "
"Claudia: Well, now we don't have to talk all business. But I do want to mention that we may be replacing one of our nationally syndicated hosts, The Happy Traveler. "
"Frasier: Oh, yes. The Happy Traveler. How's that coming? "
"Claudia: Not well. Unless they get more realistic with those ransom demands, he's never coming out of that jungle. "
"Sebastian: There certainly are a lot of gnats buzzing around out here. "
"Claudia: Yes, there are. "
"Frasier: Here, allow me. "
"Niles: Oh, dear God "
"Sebastian: There were no bugs at my party. "
"Claudia: What's that on the beach? "
"Sebastian: I don't know, but it's wearing a boa. "
"Frasier: No, no. That's preposterous. It's just a rock with some seaweed on it. "
"Claudia: Niles, there seems to be something with feathers flashing at us. "
"Niles: Yes, yes, that's my neighbor. Don't clap, it just encourages her. "
"Claudia: Does anyone else smell something? "
"Niles: I know what I smell Truffles "
"Frasier: Everyone, time for dinner. "
"Niles: Yes, step lively. Mm-mmm. Truffles. "
"Niles: All right, get out there and stab that thing. "
"Frasier: No. I'm sick to death of chaperoning that carcass. "
"Niles: Well I can't do it, I'm the host. "
"Frasier: Niles, because of that woman in there and a scrappy band of Third World rebels, I am this close to getting a national radio show of my own. You have to do it. "
"Niles: All right. Get me a knife, close those curtains and don't let anyone out on this deck until I come back. "
"Frasier: Fine. "
"Niles: Where's the damn thing gone to? "
"Niles: Got it, thanks. "
"Claudia: I've listened to your show. And what impressed me most is your ability to focus. "
"Frasier: Yes, well I'm very proud of that. I try to give each of my callers my complete, undivided... [He notices Sebastian headed for the deck.] Excuse me. Would you please just stay inside? We're about to start dinner. "
"Sebastian: You said that ten minutes ago. "
"Frasier: Yes, so it's even truer now, isn't it? Just sit down. I'm sorry. Back to my show. "
"Claudia: I must say, I was wondering myself when we'd be eating. It's getting late. "
"Frasier: Well, Niles is in the kitchen, right now, trying to prod Marcel along. You know how it is with these perfectionists. "
"Marcel: I am waiting to serve. Where is Niles? "
"Claudia: You mean he's not with you? "
"Frasier: Well, I'm sure he's around here somewhere. You know, perhaps he's upstairs making a phone call. If you could just keep everything warm, I'm sure he'll be down in a minute. "
"Marcel: He'd better be. I reheat for no one. "
"Frasier: Well, I'm terribly sorry about all these interruptions. Now, let's get back to that job. "
"Claudia: Well, you'd be in ninety-three markets... "
"Frasier: Excuse me, can I help you? "
"Guest: I just saw a meteor. "
"Claudia: Oh, have they started? "
"Frasier: Please, everyone, stand back and witness the spectacular view through this transom. "
"Claudia: Can't we see them better outside? "
"Frasier: No, no, it's much safer in here. You see, you never know where they might land. "
"Frasier: Perhaps that's Niles. "
"McLean: Hello, is Niles Crane here? We're investigating a possible homicide. "
"Claudia: What? "
"McLean: Your neighbor saw Dr. Crane and another man row out to sea with a third party dressed in a nightie. The men returned alone. We suspect they dumped the body overboard. "
"Frasier: Oh... all right, now, now, there's nothing to be alarmed about. Please gentlemen, come in, you see, I can clear this whole thing up. You see, I was the other man in the rowboat. "
"Claudia: You dumped a body overboard? "
"Frasier: Well... "
"Gretchen: Thank God you're here I just saw a murder "
"Claudia: What? "
"Gretchen: Dr. Crane was on the beach with his wife, Maris. I recognized her peignoir. I could even smell her perfume. He was stabbing her again and again. "
"Frasier: Ah, no, clearly this woman is delusional. Listen, search the entire house, I defy you to find one scrap of evidence that there's been foul play here. "
"Marcel: My butcher knife has disappeared from the kitchen. "
"McLean: Go check the beach. "
"Frasier: Please, people, I assure you there is nothing sinister going on here. "
"Niles: Hello, all. Meteor shower's started. Oh, excuse me. "
"Frasier: Niles, there's been a little misunderstanding. Perhaps it's time you explained to everyone about the dead seal. "
"Niles: Dead seal? At my Golden Apron dinner? That's enough bubbly for you "
"Frasier: Niles, they think you murdered Maris "
"Gretchen: I saw him stabbing her "
"Niles: Oh, I see what's happened Oh, this is funny Oh, you are all going to laugh when you hear this. I was simply stabbing a seal. "
"Claudia: You killed a seal? "
"Niles: Oh, no, no, I didn't kill it, it was already dead when we found it. "
"McLean: You found a dead seal? "
"Frasier: Yes. "
"McLean: And it was wearing a peignoir? "
"Frasier: Now that is ludicrous. We put the pegnoir on it. "
"McLean: And the perfume too? "
"Frasier: Yes, of course. "
"McLean: So you found a dead seal, dressed it in a peignoir, doused it in perfume, and stabbed it? "
"Niles: I told you you'd laugh. "
"Athanis: I found this washed up on the beach. "
"Niles: Well there, if that doesn't prove my innocence, I don't know what does. "
"Gretchen: Gott im himmel It's covered in her blood "
"Marcel: Dinner is served. "
"McLean: Sorry folks, no one can leave. This is a crime scene. "
"Niles: Well, it certainly would be a crime if we missed that dinner Everyone, sit down There's place cards all around the table. "
"Athanis: OK, gentlemen, let's go. "
"Niles: Well, he said no one can leave. "
"Frasier: Claudia, perhaps we can discuss that job tomorrow. You know, I've got some business cards in my breast pocket if you'd like to fish one out. No? Fine, I'll just call you then. "
"Niles: Officer? You can't arrest me. My wife is alive She's in Antwerp, getting her elbows done "
"Frasier: Oh, give it up, Niles, even I didn't believe that one. "

"Frasier: A gold leaf candle snuffer? Huh. My, what a spendthrift this Charles the Tenth was. Well of course I want you to bid on it for me, Greg, so start waving your paddle "
"Roz: Hey. "
"Frasier: Oh, Roz, you got my message "
"Roz: Yeah, you said you had good news. What's up? "
"Frasier: More "
"important: What's down? "
"Roz: Oh, fun. Wordplay. "
"Frasier: No, no, the ratings are out for KACL's first six months of all-salsa radio. "
"Roz: And they were lousy? "
"Frasier: They aspire to lousy "
"Roz: So I guess they'll be looking for a new format. "
"Frasier: Better "
"yet: an old format "
"Roz: What, you think they're gonna bring us back? "
"Frasier: That's the scuttlebutt on the street. "
"Roz: Oh, this is great Aren't you thrilled? "
"Frasier: I'd be shouting it from the rooftops if I weren't saving my instrument. "
"Frasier: Thank you. "
"Colette: May I help you? "
"Roz: Non-fat capp... Haven't seen you before. I'm Roz, this is Frasier. "
"Colette: Colette. "
"Frasier: Ah, your mother was a fan of the great French novelist and raconteur Sidonie-Gabriel Colette. "
"Colette: OK. "
"Bulldog: Hey, guys, you won't... Whoa Any more like you at home? "
"Colette: No. "
"Bulldog: Good, we'll have privacy. Short drip. "
"Colette: Colette. "
"Bulldog: Hey, you guys seen these numbers? "
"Frasier: Yes. "
"Bulldog: Salsa radio is in el dumperacha. "
"Frasier: See? "
"Bulldog: KACL is gonna be on their knees begging us to come back to work. "
"Roz: You know that lady from the temp agency who's always saying I have a bad attitude? "
"Frasier: Yes. "
"Roz: I can't wait to tell that bean-counting fathead where she can put her timesheet I'm quitting on the way home "
"Colette: Ooh... "
"Frasier: What? Did you say something? "
"Colette: No. No, never mind. "
"Frasier: You know what? I better cancel my lecture next week. Can't be out of town if I'm gonna be working. "
"Colette: Ooh... "
"Frasier: Is everything all right, Collette? "
"Colette: Oh, I hate this. "
"Roz: What? "
"Colette: Well, I overhear things. I'm not trying to, it just happens when you're a waitress. "
"Roz: And you overheard something about KACL? "
"Colette: They're not dropping salsa. "
"Roz: What? "
"Frasier: How do you know that? "
"Colette: Well, the station owner was in this morning and he said 'It's my station, and I like salsa music, and I'm sticking with it.' But that could mean anything. "
"Roz: I knew I shouldn't have gotten my hopes up. "
"Bulldog: This stinks This is total BS "
"Frasier: Oh, what are you upset about, Bulldog? You've got a job. "
"Bulldog: Not anymore. I got canned last Friday for somethin' I said on the air. I was talking to this golfer chick who said she wanted to enter the Women's Open. Like I'm supposed to leave that alone. "
"Roz: I'm starting to think we're never going back to work. "
"Frasier: Now, now, Roz, they can't stay with a failing format forever. I guarantee you, in three months, if the numbers are this bad, they'll have to make a change. "
"Roz: Three months is an eternity. My rent's gone up, the baby stuff costs a fortune. I stopped buying Alice those little pink headbands they make for little girls whose hair hasn't grown in yet. Now when I go out, I just call her Howard. "
"Frasier: Well, Roz, you know what? If things have gotten that tight, let me lend you some money to tide you over. "
"Roz: Oh that's very sweet, but I couldn't. "
"Frasier: No, please, it's not a hardship for me, I'll be fine for the next three months. "
"Roz: Oh, I don't know. I'm not sure I feel comfortable taking money from you. "
"Frasier: Try putting your hair in a bun. That used to help Lilith. Now, how much can I give you? "
"Roz: Fifteen hundred? I mean, I wouldn't ask for so much, it's just... "
"Frasier: No, no, it's none of my business. You can just pay me back whenever you'd like. This is your money to do with as you see fit. There we are. [Pulls the check out and gives it to her.] "
"Roz: Thank you. "
"Frasier: Oh, please, Roz, don't even mention it. Makes me feel good to share my good fortune with someone. You know what, I just got a call from my antique scout. He's found a gilded candle snuffer that the Seattle Museum would pay a pretty penny for to have in their collection. "
"Colette: Ooh... "
"Frasier: I hate her. "
"Frasier: I'm sorry Niles, I have no idea where it is. I'm not even sure I own one. "
"Niles: Oh, don't be ridiculous, Frasier. Dad, have you seen Frasier's fritatta pan? "
"Martin: Hi, Marty Crane. I don't believe we've met. "
"Frasier: Dad, what on Earth are you doing? "
"Martin: Oh, Eddie's woozy. There's this vicious blue jay on the terrace that keeps teasing him, then Eddie goes chasing after him, slams into that glass door and this bird just struts around, big as you please, laughing that snooty bird laugh. "
"Niles: Snooty bird laugh? "
"Martin: Yeah, like that. "
"Martin: I want to put stick-ems on the door so Eddie remembers it's glass. "
"Frasier: Oh, yes, Dad By al means, let's add rainbow decals to the nose prints and the bits of fur that already festoon it "
"Martin: Well, you're pretty grouchy for someone who just got his job back. "
"Frasier: Well, maybe that's because I'm not getting my job back "
"Martin: What happened? You said it was a sure thing this morning. "
"Frasier: Well it wasn't I spoke with Bebe, she confirmed that they're keeping salsa. "
"Martin: Oh, I'm sorry. "
"Frasier: Yes, well don't despair, Dad. There are other jobs. Bebe told me that I'm on the short list for the voice of Chester, the Yummy-Nuts Squirrel. "
"Daphne: All right. Don't anyone go out in this weather. I am so soaked, my dress is pasted right on me. It's a good thing I had this coat in the trunk. "
"Niles: Yes, that was lucky. Let me take it for you. "
"Daphne: No, it's all right. I'll keep it on for the moment, thanks. Here you are, Dr. Crane, I stopped off at the Tre Anom Day Spa and picked up your papaya exfoliant and your neck cream por aloe. "
"Frasier: Thank you, Daphne. I wouldn't have sent you out in this weather if it weren't an emergency. "
"Daphne: Oh, by the way, I saw Roz down at the spa, having herself an all-day beauty treatment. "
"Frasier: You know, that's strange. "
"Martin: Why? "
"Frasier: Well, Roz has been a little cash poor lately. In fact, I gave her a loan myself this morning. Then she heads down to the Tre Anom. You know, I have half a mind to have a word with her about it. "
"Martin: Uh, bad idea. You loaned her that money, it's hers now. It's not yours and it's none of your business what she does with it. "
"Frasier: Yes, that's exactly what I told her, but still... "
"Martin: Now, trust me. More friendships have been ruined because of something like this. Smartest thing you can do is never bring it up. "
"Frasier: I'm aware of that, Dad, it's just she must have gone straight from the cafe down to the spa Don't you think that's odd? "
"Martin: Well, not when you stack it up against a man who uses neck cream. "
"Niles: Before you mock this product, you might recall you went to this spa. "
"Martin: What? "
"Niles: Don't you remember? Two years ago. For your birthday I gave you that special gift certificate for you and Sherry to have a day of indulgence. You told me you used it. "
"Martin: Oh, yeah. Right. "
"Frasier: Remind us, Dad, what treatments did you have? "
"Martin: Oh, we got the whole shootin' match. First, they rubbed us all over, and then they uh, they washed us down with this liniment oil, and then they hit us with those hickory sticks. "
"Frasier: For God's sake, you've heard us talk about it enough, you'd think you'd be able to bluff a little better than that. "
"Martin: You'd be surprised at what I don't listen to. I'm sorry, Niles, I hope you're not mad. "
"Niles: Mad? No, I'm delighted If you still have the certificate, we can go together. "
"Martin: Nah, I don't think so. "
"Niles: Oh, please, I need this. "
"Martin: You know, a spa's just not my speed. I just keep picturing myself standing over some drain being hosed down like some old circus animal. "
"Niles: But, Dad, I can't afford this sort of thing for myself anymore. I, I'd go without you but the certificate's in your name. Please? "
"Martin: Oh, all right. "
"Niles: Oh, great I'm going to go make a reservation before you change your mind. "
"Martin: And what are you smirking at? "
"Frasier: Oh, I'm just musing about the timeless moments that bind a father to a son. Game of catch, trip to a fishing hole, shared rain forest mud facial. "
"Frasier: Ah, Niles, I thought today was your spa day. "
"Niles: It is, I'm on my way, and I need it now more than ever. Last night, at the Shangri-La, the most scandalous thing happened... "
"Frasier: Now's not the best time. "
"Niles: Oh, sorry, I didn't see you there. I'll have... "
"Colette: A non-fat cappuccino? "
"Niles: Good guess "
"Colette: No, I've waited on you before. "
"Niles: I don't think so, I'm very observant. "
"Niles: Anyway, I was invited to a housewarming party for a new arrival, Stuey. I hadn't been there two minutes when I heard a pop. I looked up, there was the '81 Chateau Haut Brion I brought being decanted into a punch bowl of sangria, canned fruit and erotic ice cubes. I haven't been so depressed since Maris started seeing what's-his-name. "
"Colette: Schenkman. "
"Niles: Thank you. "
"Colette: Uh-huh. "
"Roz: Hey, guys. "
"Frasier: Oh, Roz. "
"Niles: Roz. "
"Roz: Shopping really takes it out of you. "
"Frasier: Really? Stocking up on supplies for baby Alice? "
"Roz: Oh, no, it's Momma's turn today. Back in a minute. "
"Frasier: Bidwell's? My God, isn't that a little pricey? "
"Niles: I'll say, it's Maris's favorite store. They give points for every dollar you spend there. One year, she got enough to have Tony Bennett come to our house and sing. "
"Frasier: Well at this rate, she's going to go through that loan in no time. I'm just wondering if I should have a talk with her. "
"Niles: No, I understand your impulse, but I'm with Dad on this one. Questioning her about how she's going to spend that money is only going to lead to trouble. "
"Frasier: I'm not sure I agree. Of course the entire point may be moot, anyway. How do I know there's anything more extravagant in here than calendars and socks... [He starts to look in the bags.] "
"Niles: Don't even think about it. You know as well as I do that there is absolutely no justification for going through her bags. "
"Frasier: You're right, there isn't. [He takes his keys and throws them in a bag.] Now there is. "
"Niles: Frasier "
"Frasier: Just shut up and keep a lookout Cashmere sweater? Bidwell's private label perfume? "
"Niles: Here she comes. "
"Frasier: My keys "
"Roz: That's the last time I wear the shoes right out of the store, my feet are killing me "
"Niles: I should go. I want to get down to the spa before Dad. He may bridle when the front desk clerk asks him if he prefers a man or a woman. "
"Roz: Wow, is that the time? I've got to meet Carol for lunch at La Gallou. "
"Frasier: La Gallou? Uh, you know, Roz, before you go... "
"Roz: I know, if I drop your name, they'll give me better service. I'll call you later. "
"Colette: Can I get you anything else? "
"Frasier: Yes, a taxi. "
"Colette: I already called. "
"Frasier: Oh, damn "
"Daphne: Not to worry, Dr. Crane, I'll have that spot cleaned up in no time. "
"Frasier: Thank you, Daphne. "
"Niles: Lock up your daughters, the men are back from the hunt "
"Frasier: Oh, well, boys, how was your day at the spa? "
"Niles: Fantastic. You should have seen Dad. I walked by the serenity room just as Olga and Sergei were giving him a full-body sudsing. "
"Martin: I never felt so clean and so dirty at the same time. "
"Niles: See you later, Dad. Great day "
"Frasier: All right, how bad was it? "
"Niles: Mortifying First of all, he refused to go nude, even in the private rooms. "
"Frasier: Well, Niles, don't "
"forget: Dad is of a different generation. "
"Niles: Wearing socks and underpants and carrying a wallet into a mud bath is not a generational issue. If you ever hear me offer to take Dad to a spa again, wash out my mouth with jug wine. "
"Niles: Did you ever get your keys back from Roz? "
"Frasier: No, no. Actually, I had to wait the entire day before she found them in her bag. She's on her way over right now, gives me a chance to talk to her about her spending. "
"Niles: Frasier, why do you insist on traipsing into that minefield? "
"Frasier: Niles, I don't want to talk to her about it, I have to. At the rate she's spending, she's going to be out of money before we're back to work. And frankly, I'm just a little bit annoyed at how she keeps flaunting it in my face. Expensive lunches, needless extravagances. Frankly I think the entire thing's just a bit insensitive, don't you? "
"Daphne: Excuse me, not to interrupt, but six months ago you borrowed forty dollars from me. We were at the wine shop, remember? You couldn't quite scrape together enough for a bottle of your precious Chateau Mr. Fussy-Pants? So I lent you the money. And have I said a peep about it since? No I just sit here quietly reusing my tea bags while you trundle off to your private clubs ordering gourmet this and imported that 'Are the cigars Cuban?' 'Are the Tulips Dutch?' 'Oh, good "
"news: my personal shopper just found a dozen antique pudding plates.' Who has twelve people over for pudding? So you gave poor Roz a bit of money It hasn't changed your life, has it, you sherry-swilling, foie gras- munching hypocrite? "
"Frasier: Daphne? I did repay you. "
"Daphne: What? "
"Frasier: I paid for that parking ticket. Fifty dollars as I recall. It means you owe me ten. "
"Daphne: Oh, right. Well, I'm glad you said something. It's not good to let these things fester. "
"Martin: Niles, I think I'm having a weird reaction to that spa stuff. My skin's startin' to tingle and tighten up. "
"Niles: Oh, that's the citrus reacting with your natural oils. It's a good sign. "
"Martin: Well, it doesn't feel so good, I just scratched my chin and my eyelid closed. "
"Niles: Oh, that'll be Roz. Maybe I'll take my leave before the fur starts to fly. "
"Frasier: Oh Niles, there's not going to be any fur flying. Unless of course she bought one on the way over here. "
"Roz: Hey, Niles. "
"Niles: Roz. "
"Frasier: Roz. "
"Roz: Are you on the way out? "
"Niles: Yes, good night. "
"Roz: Here are your keys. "
"Frasier: Thank you, Roz. We had to turn the whole café inside out looking for them. "
"Roz: I would have been here a lot sooner, but I stopped to get you something. "
"Frasier: Uh, Roz, gosh, you know, you really shouldn't have. "
"Roz: I wanted to. This is just my way of saying 'Thank you' for how great you've been. "
"Frasier: But, you see, you really shouldn't have. I mean, for one thing, it's just... "
"Frasier: Gosh, it is lovely, Roz, it's just that... Listen, there's something I really need to talk to you about... "
"Roz: Now, that decanter is not just to say 'Thank you.' It's also to say 'Congratulations' The station manager called me half an hour ago, I made him promise he'd let me tell you. The board has reconsidered, they're changing formats, they're bringing us back "
"Frasier: Oh, well Roz That's fantastic "
"Roz: We start tomorrow "
"Martin: What's goin' on? "
"Frasier: Good news, Dad, good news We got our jobs back at KACL "
"Martin: Oh, great. Congratulations. "
"Roz: Well, I thought we'd at least get smile out of you. "
"Martin: I thought I was smiling. "
"Jorge: ....Adios amigos. Adios, KACL, adios. "
"Bulldog: This is so great, we're all back together again. "
"Frasier: Hey, Noel Good to see you. What you been up to? "
"Noel: Well, actually, I never left. Yo hablo Espanol. [to an unhappy woman] Adios, Maria. "
"Roz: Hi, everybody "
"All: Roz "
"Roz: Isn't this the best? It's so great to see everyone. Bulldog and Noel and Frasier and... you. "
"Bulldog: God, I didn't think I'd ever see this place again. It's like we're soldiers comin' back from the war. "
"Bulldog: I'm home "
"Frasier: Well, you know, as much as I'd like to continue this celebration, in three minutes, we have a show to do. Come on, Roz, let's go "
"Frasier: Noel? "
"Noel: Oh, I just wanted to say I missed you most of all, Roz. "
"Roz: Oh, thanks Noel, that's so sweet. "
"Frasier: Yes, that certainly is sweet, Noel, off you go. "
"Noel: Me, nothin' much has changed. Still live with my mom. Still working on that Klingon-to-English dictionary. "
"Frasier: Noel, how do you say goodbye in Klingon? "
"Noel: Oh, it depends. If you're talking to a superior officer, then... "
"Frasier: Noel "
"Noel: Krish-krush. "
"Roz: I am so thrilled to be back "
"Frasier: Oh, God, so am I Roz, you know I couldn't get a wink of sleep last night. But I put the time to good use though, I composed a little speech to open today's show. "
"Roz: Oh, that's great. You know, as I was falling asleep last night, it occurred to me that you wanted to talk to me about something. "
"Frasier: Right. Right, oh, well, it was just, I just had a little bone to pick with you, but it's gone by the wayside now. "
"Roz: Are you sure? "
"Frasier: Oh, absolutely. You know how thing's are when you're out of work. You know you just get a little crazy about little stuff. "
"Roz: Oh, tell me about it. Money things alone. "
"Frasier: Well, as a matter of fact... "
"Roz: What? "
"Frasier: No, no, no, it's not an issue anymore, Roz. "
"Roz: Come on. "
"Frasier: Well, all right. It's just that I thought the way you were, uh, spending money was a little unwise. You know, spa days, expensive lunches, Bidwell's perfume? I, I just thought, you know, you were unemployed... But, you know what? You're employed now, so there it is. End of subject, I won't even bring it up again. "
"Roz: I never told you I bought that perfume. "
"Frasier: Hmmm? Well, I, I... you didn't have to, I can smell it on you. "
"Roz: I'm not wearing any. "
"Frasier: You're kidding. My goodness, is that you? Well then you should sweat into bottles. We've got a show to do. "
"Roz: The only way you could know that is if you were looking through my shopping ba... the keys "
"Frasier: Roz, you know, we really should be setting up. "
"Roz: I can't believe this You were searching through my bags? What, is this about the loan? "
"Frasier: All right. Fine. I gave you fifteen hundred dollars and suddenly you were off on a spending spree. "
"Roz: Excuse me, but weren't you the one that said I could spend it any way I wanted? "
"Frasier: Well, I just thought you were going to be a little more responsible than that "
"Roz: Oh, so now I'm irresponsible? "
"Frasier: No, no, I'm just saying that a woman in your situation... "
"Roz: What situation? Oh, I know what this is all about, my baby. "
"Frasier: Roz "
"Roz: That's what all this irresponsible stuff is. "
"Frasier: No, that is not what I meant. "
"Roz: Well, listen, obviously I am not to be trusted with your precious money, so I'm paying you back. And not that it's any of your business, but Carol took me out to La Gallou, and my mother gave me a day at the spa, and those shoes were a store credit. Oh, and I bought the perfume. That was just for me, because I wanted it. [She hands him the check.] "
"Frasier: Roz, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to say any of those things. "
"Roz: Too late. "
"Frasier: Please, I can't stand to have you mad at me. Look, let me take you to dinner tonight, we can discuss it afterward. "
"Roz: You're on. "
"Frasier: Thank you. "
"Roz: No. You're on in five seconds. "
"Frasier: Good afternoon Seattle, this is Dr. Frasier Crane and we're back. But don't worry, I may have been gone a while, but I think I remember how all these knobs and buttons work. "
"Frasier: I see they've moved the cough button. Well, anyway, I composed some thoughts last night about what this show has meant to me in the last years, and well, I'd like to share it with you now. I realized I have a lot to feel grateful for; grateful for my listeners who trusted me with their problems; and grateful for the person whom I most trust. It's not an exaggeration to say I put my career in this woman's hands every day. "
"Frasier: And she never lets me down. She shoulders many responsibilities here, and in her personal life, with a grace and skill I admire more than she'll ever know. I'm proud to call her my "
"friend: my producer, Roz Doyle. "
"Frasier: Well, now, on to the show. If I'm a bit rusty, I hope you'll forgive me. After all, to err is human. I hope you'll look into your hearts... "
"Roz: All right, Frasier, you're forgiven. "
"Frasier: Oh, good Well, we've got a quick word from our sponsor, and then we'll be back with your calls. Back after this. "
"Roz: Thanks, Frasier. I'm sorry I got so mad. "
"Frasier: Oh, Roz, you had every right to. How could I think you would ever squander the money I gave you that way? You'd never be that irresponsible. "
"Roz: Well, of course I wouldn't. But if it was on your mind, I'm glad you brought it up. I like that we can always be honest with each other. "
"Frasier: I like that, too. "
"Roz: I'm so touched that you stayed up all night last night and wrote all those things about me. "
"Frasier: I meant every word. "
"Noel: Hey, Dr. Crane. Great speech. I love what you said about Roz. "
"Frasier: Thank you, Noel. "
"Roz: Hey Bulldog, can you loan me some money? "
"Bulldog: Sure, how much? "
"Roz: Fifteen hundred. I just wrote a bad check. "
"Noel: Hey, wait a minute. There's nothing in here about Roz. "
"Frasier: Noel, put that down. "
"Noel: 'Like Napoleon's triumphant return from Elba..' "
"Frasier: Krish-krush, krish-krush "

"Roz: I thought your father was in charge of Christmas decorations. "
"Frasier: Oh, no, no, not this year. We're doing it my way. That's why I'm ordering a tasteful tree here. They'll even deliver it on Christmas Eve, fully decorated. "
"Roz: Gee, that'll be fun for Freddie. "
"Frasier: Oh no, Frederick won't be joining me this year. He's spending his vacation on an archaeological tour with Lilith. "
"Roz: He's spending Christmas with dried-up old bones? "
"Frasier: I thought I told you, she's taking him on an archaeological tour. Oh good lord, look how late it's gotten "
"Roz: Well, don't blame me, you're the one who spent twenty minutes looking for that candleholder thing. "
"Frasier: Oh, no, no, it's a Menorah, Roz. I thought I'd get one for Frederick for Hanukah. "
"Roz: Oh, that's right, I completely forgot Frederick is half-Jewish. "
"Frasier: Yes, between the Crane boy genes and Lilith's contribution, I'm not sure the NFL is holding its breath. "
"Roz: I need to go over to 'Notions' and try to find something for Calvin, the security guard. "
"Frasier: Oh, what are you getting him? "
"Roz: If I knew I wouldn't be going to 'Notions.' "
": "
"Frasier: Excuse me, I'd like to get a gift for that woman I was with. Er, how about this sweater right here? "
"Sal: Excellent choice. "
"Frasier: I'm not sure of the size, though, could you find me this in a medium? Thank you. "
"Roz: It's a madhouse in there "
"Frasier: Roz "
"Roz: People pushing and shoving for nose-hair clippers. Is there a nasal hair epidemic I don't know about? "
"Sal: Here's your sweater. "
"Roz: Is he talking to you? "
"Frasier: No No, no, he's talking... "
"Helen: He's talking to me It's for my niece. But I'm a bit worried about the size. You know, she's just about your height. Do you mind my asking, would this fit you? "
"Roz: Mmm, that's a little big for me. "
"Helen: What about the color? A little blah? "
"Roz: Personally, I like the blue. "
"Helen: I agree, thank you so much. I will take a smaller size in the blue, and please gift-wrap it. "
"Sal: Coming right up. "
"Frasier: Oh, Roz, it looks like 'Notions' has thinned out. "
"Roz: Oh good, so you think Calvin will like the nose hair clippers? "
"Frasier: Well, I think we can be sure he doesn't own a pair "
"Frasier: Gosh, thank you so much for bailing me out that way. "
"Helen: My pleasure. Helen. "
"Frasier: Helen, Frasier. "
"Helen: Not Frasier Crane, from the radio show? "
"Frasier: Yes. "
"Helen: Oh, ha-ho, I listen to you every time I come to Seattle to visit my daughter, Faye. "
"Frasier: Well, that's very kind. "
"Helen: You know, you really should know your wife's size. "
"Frasier: Oh, she's not my wife. "
"Helen: I'm sorry, I didn't mean to pry. "
"Frasier: It's all right. "
"Helen: Girlfriend? "
"Frasier: No, I don't have a girlfriend, actually. I'm unattached. "
"Helen: Oh. Well, I've taken enough of your time. Although, there is one small thing you could help me with. I'm looking for something for my daughter. "
"Frasier: Oh, what is it? "
"Helen: Nah, no, I really shouldn't ask. "
"Frasier: No, no, please. "
"Helen: No, no, it's too much of an imposition. "
"Frasier: No, no. After the way you came to my rescue, I would be delighted to help you in any way I can. What is it you're looking to get for your daughter? "
"Helen: A date with a nice, unattached doctor. "
"Frasier: Well, I certainly walked into that one, didn't I? "
"Helen: It wasn't my first time "
"Frasier: All right, now as soon as this woman gets here give me five minutes and then call me on my cell phone. If I am miserable I will simply say it's an emergency and excuse myself. "
"Niles: Ah, yes, the ever-valuable escape call. "
"Frasier: Oh, you've done them? "
"Niles: Oh... No, but I've seen them done. "
":-) ] "
"Faye: Excuse me, are you Frasier? "
"Frasier: Yes, hello [rises and shakes her hand] How did you know it was me? "
"Faye: You had that horror-stricken look of someone who's met my mother. "
"Frasier: Oh, no, please, please, shall we? "
"Faye: Oh, no, that's very sweet of you but you don't have to go through with this. I really just came to apologize. "
"Frasier: No, please, please, why don't you sit down? "
"Daphne: Hey, Dr. Crane. Are you here with your brother? "
"Niles: No, actually he's on a blind date. "
"Daphne: Oh, he is, isn't he "
"Daphne: Oh, look at him. I think he really fancies her. You know, it's always so obvious when a man likes a woman. "
"Daphne: You can just tell by his awkward body language. "
"Daphne: Shifting in his chair, he doesn't know quite what to do with his hands. "
"Daphne: He's as nervous as a hen. Oh for God's sake, stop fidgeting "
"Frasier: So, your mother tells me that you're a lawyer. "
"Faye: Well, that's typical. I was a lawyer and I quit two years ago, and now I'm a pastry chef. "
"Frasier: Really? "
"Faye: Yes. I work in a little French restaurant in town. Maybe you've heard of it? Le Cigaré Volant. "
"Frasier: My God, it's one of my favorites I had dinner there last Friday night. "
"Faye: I worked there last Friday night, what did you have? "
"Frasier: The Grand Marquis Soufflé. "
"Faye: I made that. "
"Frasier: Oh, it was poetry on a plate. "
"Faye: Thank you. You didn't happen to find my earring in it, did you? I'm kidding "
"Frasier: Oh, you know, suddenly I'm glad that your mother is as pushy as she is. It's funny, though, you're nothing like her. "
"Faye: That's the nicest thing anyone's ever said to me. "
"proposal: "
"Daphne: Dr. Crane, can I ask a favor? What are you doing for the next ten nights, because my... "
"Niles: Excuse me, finish the question. "
"Daphne: Well, my neighborhood theatre group is putting on a holiday revue; in fact, we're performing in the common room of Dr. Crane's building. "
"Niles: Right downstairs? "
"Daphne: Yeah, but we're still looking for a musical director. I would never ask you but they've put me in charge of the whole thing. "
"Niles: Oh, well count me in. Is the show more religious in tone or secular? "
"Daphne: Well, we couldn't quite agree. So we ended up with a mixed bag. Er, we open with the 'no room at the inn' scene, then it's a rousing version of 'Jingle Bell Rock,' a brief medley from 'Jesus Christ Superstar.' And the first act ends with Santa's elves and the three wise men all linking arms and singing 'Frosty the Snowman.' "
"Niles: Well... Excuse me, I have to make a phone call. "
"Frasier: Of course I love Boston but well, there's no place like home. "
"Frasier: Excuse me. Yes, hello? Uh, yes but you know what, I'll just have to sign those papers later, thank you. Office work. "
"Faye: That was an escape call, wasn't it? "
"Frasier: No What are you talking about? "
"Faye: Come on, it's a blind date. You wanted a way to back out. "
"Frasier: Oh, gosh, you are sharp, aren't you? How did you know? "
"Frasier: Well, that would be just lovely. All right, I'll see you soon. Well, isn't that nice? Faye's dropping by. "
"Niles: Oh, you've been seeing a lot of her lately, haven't you? "
"Frasier: Yes, I have. You know, she really is quite wonderful. "
"Niles: Well, I thought she was off to Florida with her mother. "
"Frasier: Yes, she is. They're both popping by on the way to the airport. I guess someone wanted to rack up a few more frequent Frasier miles. "
"Niles: You don't ever actually say those things to the woman, do you? "
"Frasier: Oh, no, no. "
"Daphne: Oh good, Dr. Crane, you're here. "
"Niles: Yes, the show starts in half an hour. "
"Daphne: Yeah, could you give me a hand? I still have to sew the chains to Jacob Marley's tux for the dance number. "
"Niles: Oh, yeah, happy to. "
"Frasier: Jacob Marley? They're doing 'A Christmas Carol' too? "
"Niles: No, they're not. They worked him into the nativity scene. "
"Martin: Hey Fras', where's a good spot for Rudolph this year? "
"Frasier: Dad Please, I thought we had an agreement about the decorations. "
"Martin: I know, but what's Christmas without Rudolph? "
"Frasier: He is not even one of the original reindeer "
"Martin: Well, do the others have a song? "
"Frasier: Look, I'm not having this discussion again "
"Martin: It's because you know I'm right. Well, forget it, I wouldn't want to ruin your designer Christmas "
"Frasier: Oh, Faye. Hi, good to see you. Here, let me take your coat. Where's Helen? "
"Faye: Er, she's talking to your doorman. She's trying to fix him up with my cousin Janet and I couldn't bear to watch. "
"Frasier: We'll just leave that ajar for her then. "
"Faye: Oh my gosh. "
"Frasier: What? "
"Faye: You have a wreath. "
"Frasier: Yes, so? "
"Faye: Aren't you Jewish? "
"Frasier: No, no, why do you ask? "
"Faye: The day we met my mother saw you shopping for a Menorah. "
"Frasier: Yes, for my son. My ex-wife is Jewish. "
"Faye: Oh, God... "
"Frasier: Is there a problem? "
"Faye: Uh, for me, no, but my mother is another story, and here I was wondering what we'd talk about on the seven hour flight to Miami. "
"Frasier: You know what, I can just take this down. "
"Faye: Uh, no, no, no, no, I have to stop being a child about these things. If she's upset, she's upset. "
"Frasier: How many stopovers do you have? "
"Faye: Two. "
"Frasier: I'll take it down. "
"Faye: Thank you. "
"Faye: I really appreciate you doing this. "
"Frasier: Oh, it's no problem. "
"Faye: I can't believe I'm actually asking you to pretend you to be Jewish on Christmas Eve. "
"Frasier: It's all right, really, it probably won't even come up. "
"Frasier: Hello, there she is "
"Helen: Hello, Frasier "
"Frasier: Helen, hi. "
"Helen: Oh, what a beautiful apartment you have. "
"Frasier: Thank you very much. "
"Frasier: GET OUT "
"Helen: What? "
"Frasier: "
"Helen: So, Frasier, you grew up in Seattle? "
"Frasier: Yes, as a matter of fact I did. "
"Helen: Such a pretty city. "
"Frasier: Oh, yes. "
"Helen: I guess you were bar mitzvahed here? "
"Frasier: Oh yes, yes of course. What a proud day that was. I can still remember reading from the Torah before the... the Rabbi... and the Cantor... and the Mohel. "
"Helen: The Mohel? "
"Frasier: Yes. "
"Faye: The one who did your circumcision? "
"Frasier: Yes, yes, I just wanted to show him that there were no hard feelings. Niles "
"Niles: Hello all, you must be Faye. "
"Helen: And I'm her mother, Helen Moskowitz. "
"Niles: And I'm Frasier's brother, Niles. Oh, what happened to the... "
"Frasier: The Moskowitz family that lived down the hall? They moved You know, Niles, why don't you come and help me in the kitchen? I'm just about to pour everybody a drink. "
"Niles: What's going on? "
"Frasier: Faye's mother thinks that we're Jewish, just play along. "
"Niles: Why? "
"Frasier: Well, it's important to Faye, Faye is important to me. Do you think you can pull it off? "
"Niles: No problem. Ooh, ham "
"Frasier: Niles Please. We've got to find a time to tell Dad about this too. "
"Niles: You mean Papa. "
"Frasier: Stop it "
"Niles: Wait, Frasier, is that for Helen? "
"Frasier: Yes. "
"Niles: What if she's expecting Jewish wine? "
"Frasier: Gosh, I'm afraid I don't have any of that on hand. "
"Niles: It's all right, it's easy enough. It's just like regular wine plus a little bit of this... "
"Niles: Try that. "
"Frasier: It's dreadful "
"Niles: Perfect. "
"Frasier: Here we are. "
"Helen: Thank you. Who has a nice toast? Niles? "
"Niles: Ooh, all right. L'chaim Mazel tov Next year in Jerusalem "
"Frasier: Take it down a notch, Tevye. "
"Martin: Hey Fras', you know, since it's the night before... "
"Niles: Dad "
"Martin: Oh, great, would it be a crime for somebody to tell me we had guests here? Hi, I'm Marty Crane. I'm Frasier's dad. Although you'd never guess it from the way I'm treated like a second-class citizen around here. But as long as Frasier's happy, why should my feelings matter? "
"Frasier: Niles, why don't you see if you can go help Dad in the kitchen? "
"Niles: Oh all right, but he'll probably just kvetch at me and frankly I don't need that tsuris. "
"Frasier: Niles ' "
"Yiddish: 'complain' and 'agonies.'] "
"Martin: I don't know how to be Jewish. "
"Niles: Well, just answer questions with a question. "
"Martin: Like what? "
"Niles: What, I have to explain everything? "
"Martin: Can't you give me an example? "
"Niles: What, I should give you an example? "
"Martin: Are you going to help me or not? "
"Niles: You're saying I'm not being helpful? "
"Martin: Oh, forget it "
"Helen: So, Marty, both your sons are doctors. How'd you work that out? "
"Martin: I've no idea. Do I? "
"Daphne: Well, I just got the phone call every producer dreads. "
"Niles: What is it? "
"Daphne: Someone's dropping out of the show. "
"Daphne: You don't suppose you could take over one of the roles? "
"Niles: Well, I don't see why not, I know all the songs. "
"Daphne: Wonderful. "
"Niles: Well, it was nice meeting you both. "
"Faye: Likewise. We're leaving too. Could you send the elevator back up, we'll be right down. "
"Niles: Happy to. So, who dropped out? "
"Daphne: Mr. Blanchard. "
"Niles: Oy "
"Frasier: Well, you know, it's been great spending some time with the two of you, I wish you could stay longer. "
"Helen: Well, actually we can. I just called the airline. The plane is delayed an hour. "
"Frasier: Well, isn't that good news? "
"Helen: You know, I hate to be forward but I'd love to taste whatever smells so wonderful in that kitchen. "
"Frasier: And I would love to give you a taste, except it isn't done yet. "
"Frasier: Well, more good news "
"TO: "
"Frasier: I don't know how much longer we can continue this charade. My God, when Dad started talking about working on his own car I thought we were goners "
"Faye: Well, we only have to keep it up for another half an hour... actually I think I have an idea. "
"Frasier: Really? "
"Faye: Go out there. "
"Frasier: Okay. "
"Frasier: Well, I don't know what it is with that brisket, it just won't cook through. "
"Helen: I could take a look. "
"Faye: No, no, we don't have the time. I just got off the phone with the airlines, they pushed the flights back up so we really have to get going. "
"Helen: Oh, really? Well, all right. "
"Frasier: Gosh, I wish you could stay longer, it's just I'd hate to have you late for your plane. "
"Deliverer: Hello, sir- "
"Frasier: On the other hand, I can't leave until you've seen the apartment, all right? "
"Faye: What? "
"Frasier: Let's start with the bedroom. There's plenty of time. "
"Frasier: Oh, Dad, could you see who it is and make sure they come back later? "
"Martin: Whatever you want, Frasier, as usual. "
"Deliverer: Hello sir, and let me wish you a merry... "
"Martin: Shush, shush, bring that thing back in about an hour. "
"Deliverer: No way sir, it's Christmas Eve, I've got a full truck downstairs. So where do you want it? "
"Martin: Oh Jeez, I don't know. "
"Deliverer: You know, a lot of people put them in their living room. "
"Martin: Here, here put it in the bathroom. "
"Deliverer: The bathroom? "
"Martin: Just put it in, all right? "
"Deliverer: Okay, I've done some crazy things... "
"Martin: All right, come on, quick. "
"Deliverer: Okay. Well, have a, you know- "
"Martin: Shut up, get out. "
"Helen: That's a beautiful bedroom, Frasier. "
"Frasier: Oh, thank you, thank you very much. "
"Helen: I noticed you were sort of quiet, Faye, almost as though you've been in there before. "
"Faye: Oh yeah, I have, Ma, but I was drunk and it was "
"dark: I don't remember so much "
"Helen: You see how she talks to her mother? Oy "
"Frasier: Jesus "
"Frasier: I'll tell you what, I just realized you haven't seen the beautiful balcony. Dad, would you do the honors and I'll check on the brisket? "
"Frasier: What is going on? "
"Niles: The man who is supposed to do the number from 'Jesus Christ Superstar' - he couldn't go on. He slipped in the shower; the man who could walk on water, but... "
"Frasier: Yes, yes, it's dripping with irony Niles, what are you doing here? "
"Niles: Well, the minute I got within ten feet of the hay for the manger scene, my allergies kicked in. I think I left my nasal spray here somewhere. "
"Frasier: I am terribly sorry to tell you this, but you've got to get the hell out of here. "
"Niles: I don't think that kind of language is appropriate. "
"Frasier: Oh, just shut up "
"balcony: "
"Frasier: Would you believe it, it's still pink in the middle. By the time my brisket's done my kugel will be dry as the Sinai. "
"Helen: It certainly is beautiful, but now I think we're cutting it close. "
"Frasier: Yes, you know, you're quite right. We can continue the tour at another time. Let me walk you to the door. "
"Helen: Thank you so much, Frasier, you're wonderful. You know, maybe I should go to the powder room before we go. "
"Frasier: Oh yes, allow me. "
"Helen: What is going on? "
"Frasier: Helen, I am so terribly sorry. "
"Niles: I'll let you all sort this out, I really have to go. "
"Helen: I understand, this is your busy time. "
"Faye: Ma, Frasier's not Jewish. I told them to pretend so you wouldn't freak out. "
"Helen: What? Well, I... you think I care, you can date anyone you want "
"Faye: Since when? "
"Helen: I can't believe you're embarrassing me like this. "
"Faye: You embarrass me on an hourly basis "
"Helen: I embarrass you? Are you hearing this? "
"Frasier: You know, maybe we should just give you your privacy... "
"Helen: No one leaves You see, you are making them uncomfortable in their own home. You could have trusted me to understand. All I want is for you to be happy. "
"Faye: As long as I'm happy in the life that you pick out for me "
"Helen: Excuse me for being a terrible mother, all I do is care "
"Faye: Oh, here it comes, the guilt Just because I don't want you controlling my whole life... "
"Helen: So what do you want me to do about it, cut myself out of it? You hate me? "
"Faye: Sometimes I DO hate you "
"Faye: I'm sorry Ma, I shouldn't have said that. "
"Helen: Why not? I am too involved. It's because you're all I have. "
"Faye: But you can't keep running my life. "
"Frasier: Maybe we should just... "
"Helen: Sit We're nearly done. "
"Helen: I have been smothering you. Maybe it's time I learned to let you go. "
"Faye: I don't want to be let go. I want you in my life - just not running it. I do love you, mom. "
"Helen: Oh, baby, I love you too. "
"suddenly: "
"Faye: Well, we should go. "
"Helen: Right. "
"Helen: Oh, thank you for a lovely visit. Enjoy your holiday. "
"Faye: I am so sorry about all this. "
"Frasier: That's all right, that's all right. Call me when you get back. "
"Frasier: Good night. "
"Martin: Boy, that was something. "
"Frasier: It certainly was. You know, we've had a couple of squabbles today, but nothing like that. "
"Martin: No way "
"Frasier: Well, maybe I should get that Christmas tree out of the bathroom. "
"Martin: One minute they're talking about one little problem; then suddenly it's everything else. Then it gets all emotional and messy and then they're hugging and then it's all over. "
"Frasier: You know, I suppose that's the healthiest way to go about it, huh, Dad? "
"Martin: Yeah, yeah, I guess you can't keep that stuff bottled up. "
"Frasier: No, if you sit on it, you'll just get madder and madder. "
"Martin: Yeah, best thing is to just lay it on the line "
"Frasier: Exactly. "
"Martin: Frasier, I want my Rudolph out for Christmas. "
"Frasier: What, this again? "
"Martin: It's just not Christmas without it "
"Frasier: Dad, we had an agreement about the Christmas decorations this year. "
"Martin: Yeah, but your Christmas stinks. I mean, do you call that a tree? "
"Frasier: You know, would it kill you to have a tasteful Christmas just once in your life? Every year we do Christmas your way. "
"Martin: And you have things your way every damn day I mean look at it, there's nothing of mine around this place except for my chair and you've taken pot shots at that right from the start because it doesn't fit in with your frou-frou knick- knacks "
"Frasier: Oh that's right, Dad, go ahead, ridicule everything I "
"do: the way I eat, the way I decorate. Do you have any idea how that makes me feel? "
"Martin: Do you know how it makes me feel to live like a guest in my own home? "
"Frasier: Dad, I do everything I can to make you feel welcome in this house, but nothing I ever do is good enough "
"Martin: A strange way of making me feel "
"welcome: taking Christmas away from me - the one time of the year when I get to do things my way Like it used to be in our home, with your mother and when you were kids You know, that's a nice memory for me, you'd think as a psychiatrist you'd figure that out "
"Frasier: Fine, I'm not even a good psychiatrist I guess I'm just a big fat let-down, aren't I? "
"Martin: And I'm just a burden to you, AND I HATE LIVING HERE "
"Frasier: AND I HATE YOU LIVING HERE "
"Frasier: Oh my God. "
"Martin: Oh, Jeez. "
"Frasier: Oh God, I feel terrible. "
"Martin: So do I. They were hugging by now "
"Frasier: We never should have tried this, we're not Jewish. "
"Martin: Maybe Mrs. Shapiro next door can talk us through it? "
"Frasier: She's out of town. "
"Martin: Oh, no. I'm sorry, I never should have said what I said. "
"Frasier: Oh Dad, no, I should have been more sensitive. I am a psychiatrist. "
"Martin: And you're a damned good one too, and I'm very proud of you. "
"Frasier: Really? "
"Martin: Yes. "
"Frasier: Oh Dad, I didn't mean any of the things I said. I love having you here. "
"Martin: I love being here. I always have. "
"Frasier: Honestly? "
"Martin: Well, no, but I thought it would get us to the hug "
"Frasier: All right, let's try. "

"Roz: So when's Freddie comin' in? "
"Frasier: Oh, actually, he's arriving in a few hours, I'm picking him up at the airport. Gosh, you know, I'm so excited to see him. It was Lilith's turn to have him for his birthday this year, but apparently there was an accident at the lab. One of her monkeys bit her on the tongue. "
"Roz: What exactly was she doing with the monkey? "
"Frasier: She was teaching them sign language. I guess one of them made a disparaging remark about her new haircut, she stuck her tongue out. "
"Roz: Wow How bad does a haircut have to be for a monkey to hate it? "
"Frasier: Well, I guess I'm just gonna have to get myself a cup of coffee. Oh, somebody dropped a wallet. "
"Roz: Hmmm. Is he cute? "
"Frasier: It's hard to tell from a driver's license photo, but he is five foot six, weighs two hundred pounds and has corrective lenses. "
"Roz: Leave it on the floor "
"Frasier: Well, thank God I don't share your 'Good deeds for hunks only' policy. Excuse me, I just found this... "
"Man: Hey, hey, is that my wallet you got there? "
"Frasier: Is it? I just found it on the floor over there, I was just about to leave it at the counter. Please, no reward. "
"Man: What happened to my cash? "
"Frasier: Well, I don't know. It was empty when I found it. "
"Man: Yeah, right I had seven bucks in here "
"Frasier: Well I'm sure some lucky thief is off enjoying a matinee and a small soda "
"Man: At least you left my credit card Jerk "
"Frasier: Would you please bring me my usual? Do you believe that guy? I do him a favor, he accuses me of stealing "
"Roz: Oh, please. The world is full of creeps like that. Haven't you figured that out yet? "
"Frasier: Well, I'm sorry, Roz, but I still believe people are basically good. "
"Bulldog: Hey, guys, I'm glad you're here. I need to talk to you about something. "
"Frasier: What can I do for you, Bulldog? "
"Bulldog: My mom's having bypass surgery tomorrow morning, and I'd like to sit up with her tonight at the hospital. But I gotta work the eleven-to-one spot. I don't suppose you could... "
"Roz: Oh, right Like we don't know there's a big fight in Vegas tonight "
"Bulldog: Look, I know I've jerked you guys around before, but this is serious. "
"Frasier: Bulldog, I'm sorry, Frederick's coming in tonight, it's his birthday. "
"Bulldog: OK, Doc. Never mind, I understand. Hello, Bernice Briscoe's room, please. I hope my mom's around to celebrate her next birthday. Hi, Mom. It's Bobby. Um, look, I'm gonna have to work tonight after all... "
"Frasier: Bulldog, wait a minute. You know what? Frederick will probably be asleep by eleven, I guess we could take your spot... "
"Roz: Are you insane? How can you be so gullible? He is not talking to his mother "
"Roz: Does somebody have a boo-boo on her heart? Is someone gonna have to open you up with those big old rib spreaders? Oh, Mrs. Briscoe, I'm so sorry. Listen, I just wanted you to know that we'll fill in for Bobby tonight. "
"Bulldog: Thanks a million, you guys. I better get back to the hospital. "
"Frasier: God bless, Bulldog. "
"Roz: I can't believe I said that Oh, that poor woman... "
"Bulldog: Hey, we're outta here "
"Woman: But our flight doesn't leave for another two hours. "
"Bulldog: No, I gotta stop by my mom's first. I owe her fifty bucks and a case of Schlitz. "
"Martin: Should I even ask? "
"Niles: These balloons come in an unsealed package, covered in some mysterious dust, straight from some southeast Asian sweatshop. Doesn't that worry you? "
"Martin: Oh, you bet it does. I remember back in Korea, we'd crouch in our foxholes, scared to death those bastards were gonna drop balloons on us. "
"Daphne: The doorman just called. They're on their way up. "
"Niles: I don't know how much of a surprise it's going to be, anyway. You did the same thing last year. "
"Martin: That's the whole point. He's never gonna suspect I'd do it two years in a row. "
"Daphne: I must say, I feel a bit bad for Freddie. None of his mates are going to be here, just us three old fogeys yelling 'Surprise'. "
"Martin: Well, any party he's at with you is gonna be a treat for him. You know, he's got that little crush on you. "
"Niles: If you really want Frederick to enjoy himself, he especially likes you in that little blue cocktail dress. "
"Daphne: Well, I'm not sure that dress is appropriate for a child's birthday party. "
"Niles: Well, it's hardly a party, it's just us fogeys. "
"TO: the elevator with Frasier and Freddie. "
"Frasier: You know, Frederick, your granddad really wanted to be here, but he had an important Rotary Club meeting. "
"Freddie: Uh-oh. "
"Frasier: What? "
"Freddie: Not another surprise party. "
"Frasier: What are you talking about? "
"Freddie: Just like last year "
"Frasier: Oh, lord, all right, all right. I'll tell you what, just don't let on, OK? You know how he loves this stuff. Just act surprised, all right? "
"Freddie: The hardest part is pretending to be fooled by those trick candles. "
"Frasier: Oh, gosh. You think it's hard now, wait 'til you're my age. "
"All: Surprise "
"Freddie: Oh, wow I'm so surprised "
"Martin: See, I told you "
"Freddie: Hi "
"Daphne: Happy birthday, sweetheart. Just let me get the phone. Hello? Yes, who's calling please? Wiwif? Anybody here know a Wiwif? "
"Frasier: Oh, Lilith Yes, hello Lilith. What's that? Oh, right Yes, of course he's here. It's your mom, Freddie, why don't you take it into your granddad's room? "
"Freddie: OK. Hi, mom. "
"Martin: Hey, let's get the cake ready. "
"Frasier: Oh, yes, yes. Oh, Frasier, I think you're going to be pleasantly surprised. "
"Frasier: Ooooh. "
"Niles: Eh, voila "
"Frasier: What the hell is that? "
"Niles: It's Louis Pasteur, Freddie's favorite scientist. "
"Frasier: What child wouldn't be thrilled with a coconut death mask on his birthday? "
"Martin: Frasier, what happened to your jacket? "
"Frasier: Oh, at the airport, I helped this woman get a dog into her car. "
"Niles: Oh, I hope at least it was in a crate. "
"Frasier: Yes, a very heavy crate. I had to hold it at arm's length so that what I chose to believe was drool wouldn't run out onto my shoes. Eight blocks later, I finally load little Fido into her backseat, the woman drives off without so much as a 'Thank you' or an offer to give me a ride back to the airport. Well, I responded with the time-honored gesture of disapproval, but on the upswing I caught my finger on the jacket and, well... I must say, my belief in people's basic decency has taken a beating today. You know, earlier I returned a man's wallet, he accused me of stealing. "
"Martin: Well, it just proves what I always "
"say: A good Samaritan is nothin' but a good target. "
"Frasier: Well, I'm sorry, Dad. I'm not ready to be quite that cynical yet. "
"Daphne: He's off the phone "
"Martin: Ooh, good. All right. Well, you can believe what you want, but I think people are born rotten, and every year they get worse. Happy birthday to you... "
"Frasier: Welcome back to the night owl edition of the Dr. Frasier Crane show. We have Stephen on line two. Go ahead, caller, you're on the air. "
"Stephen: I think I'm losing my mind, Dr. Crane. People are talking to me through my radio. "
"Frasier: Why do you think that? "
"Stephen: There it is again. "
"Frasier: Turn your radio down. "
"Stephen: Now it's giving me orders "
"Frasier: Stephen, turn your radio down. "
"Stephen: And it knows my name "
"Frasier: Stephen, listen to "
"me: this is your radio talking. I'm a very smart radio, and I care about you. And I want you to turn me off, go to bed, and seek counseling in the morning. "
"Stephen: OK. Sorry, Doc, can't talk anymore. "
"Frasier: Well, I'd like to end tonight on a philosophical note. You see, earlier today, I helped some people. [Roz uses a butterfly clip to hold her bangs up and begins wiping off her makeup with pads.] I returned a man's wallet and I aided a woman at the airport. And in return, I was accused of being a thief, and my favorite jacket was ruined. I was so disappointed by the events of the day that, on my way to work here tonight, I almost passed by an elderly man with a flat tire without stopping to help him. "
"Frasier: What the hell are you doing? ...I asked myself. How would I feel if I were in this man's position, and no one stopped to help me? Well, I did pull over, I helped the man, and frankly it felt great. So without sounding preachy, I would like to advise you all to do a good deed once in a while. If not for the sake of others, but then for your own sake. Now let's go to station ID. Roz, do you mind? "
"Roz: What is your problem? I'm getting ready for bed. Alice gets me up at the crack of dawn, if I get all this taken care of, I get an extra half hour's sleep. "
"Frasier: Well, at least you spared me the spectacle of flossing "
"Roz: Thanks for reminding me. I had corn. "
"Frasier: And we're back. It seems we've got time for one more call... Don't bother Roz, I'll get it. Go ahead, caller, this is Dr. Frasier Crane, I'm listening. "
"Ralph: Hi, Dr. Crane. This is Ralph. The guy whose tire you changed tonight? "
"Frasier: Ralph Well, what a wonderful surprise. Let me first say to our listeners that this call was not solicited in any way. "
"Ralph: Dr. Crane, I was just wondering, do you wear cuff links? "
"Frasier: Why yes, as a matter of fact, I do. But there's no need to buy me a gift. "
"Ralph: A gift? You scratched the hell out of my paint job with those things You owe me money "
"Frasier: You can't be serious How much damage can cuff links do to a car whose side window consists of duct tape and a Hefty Bag? "
"Ralph: Ah, you'll find out when my lawyer sends you the bill "
"Roz: Let me remind you again, listeners, that call was not solicited. "
"Frasier: Oh, great Somebody else in need of a good Samaritan. Maybe if I ignore her, she'll stop waving. But what am I gonnna do? Just leave her standing in the rain? Then again, every one of my good deeds today has ended up biting me in the butt. "
"Frasier: Such nasty weather, may I offer you a ride? "
"Woman: Oh, thank you. "
"Crystal: I didn't think anyone was going to stop tonight. "
"Frasier: Well, chivalry may be on life support, but it's not dead. "
"Crystal: Ooh, seat warmers. "
"Frasier: Yes, they're standard. There's a little control on the side if you want more leg room. So, where can I take you? "
"Crystal: It's up to you. We can get a room, or we can do it here, in the car. "
"Frasier: Oh, dear God. You are a prostitute. "
"Crystal: How far do these go back? "
"Frasier: Look, I'm sorry, there's been a mistake. "
"Crystal: Don't be nervous, baby. "
"Frasier: I am not nervous and would you please put your seat up. "
"Crystal: I'll put it any way you want me to, honey. "
"Frasier: Stop talking to me that way For God's sake All right, please, I am sorry about the misunderstanding but get out of my car. "
"Crystal: Well, why the hell did you pick me up? "
"Frasier: I was trying to be a gentleman, now get out "
"Crystal: I'm not walking all the way back to my corner, give me some money for a cab. "
"Frasier: All right, fine. Oh lord, I guess I must have left my wallet back at the station. "
"Crystal: Well, how in the hell were you going to pay for me? "
"Frasier: I wasn't going to pay for you Oh, good lord. Oh, here's a twenty dollar bill, now get out. "
"Frasier: Oh, God, get out Hurry, out, out "
"Crystal: It's too late, they've seen us. "
"Frasier: I don't believe this is happening to me. [He rolls down his window.] Hello officer, just how fast was I going? "
"Cop: Hey, don't I know you? "
"Frasier: No, I don't believe so. "
"Cop: No, I'm not talking to you. Didn't I bust you last week? "
"Crystal: Give me a break, buddy. I'm trying to earn a living here. "
"Frasier: Was it really necessary to take my belt and tie? "
"Cop: Standard procedure. It's for your own protection. "
"Frasier: For God's sake You had me in the drunk tank. If I wanted to kill myself I would've taken a deep breath. "
"Niles: Frasier "
"Frasier: Niles. "
"Niles: You certainly took your sweet time. I've been waiting here two hours. "
"Frasier: Well, I'm sorry, Niles. I guess what with the pillow fight in the holding tank and the pre-mug shot makeover, time just got away from me. Will you stop it? Just bail me out of here, I can't stand another minute in this place "
"Niles: All right. Excuse me, if you could get our bill together, we're ready to settle up here. "
"Fred: It's five hundred bucks. "
"Niles: Five hun... Frasier, I don't have that kind of cash on me. "
"Frasier: Put it on your credit card "
"Niles: And have 'Bail' appear on my statement? Do you know the kind of junk mail I would get? "
"Frasier: Just do it "
"Niles: OK. There you are. [He gives his card to Fred, then turns back to Frasier] So, what happened? A prostitute? "
"Frasier: Please, I told you on the phone. I didn't know she was a prostitute. "
"Niles: Uh-huh... "
"Frasier: I saw a woman stranded in the rain, naturally I offered her a ride. Before I knew it, I was handcuffed to this bench surrounded by this motley assortment of... [noticing them watching him] ...other wrongfully accused gentlemen. "
"Fred: Sir, your card didn't go through. "
"Niles: What? Oh, that's right. Maris's lawyers had my credit limit reduced. "
"Frasier: Oh, no. "
"Niles: It's been so bad, this week when I went to the cheese shop for their 'Around the World' platter, they cut me off at Luxembourg. "
"Frasier: Would you please call Dad and get him down here? "
"Niles: All right. Yeah, Dad? Hi, my credit card was declined. Well, we need yours. Yeah. Well, right. Yeah, I'll see you soon. "
"Frasier: Oh, God, this is intolerable. Now it'll take him twenty minutes to get here. "
"Niles: No, he's waiting in the car. "
"Frasier: What? Why didn't he come in? "
"Niles: Frasier, this was his old precinct. When we pulled up outside, I saw a look on his face I haven't seen since he drove us home from our first and only little league game. "
"Niles: Oh, Dad... "
"Martin: Shhh. Hold it down, will ya? "
"Frasier: Dad, I'm so sorry. What happened was... "
"Martin: No, I don't need to know. I didn't come down here to judge. You're my son, and I love you. "
"Frasier: Yes, for God's sake, Dad, I didn't... "
"Martin: Why don't we just pay up and get out of here, OK? "
"Fred: Hey, Marty. "
"Martin: Hey, Fred. "
"Fred: Listen, I wouldn't take this too hard, Marty. You remember Captain Pachesky's son turned out to be the Coleman Park Pervert. "
"Martin: Yeah, thanks. "
"Fred: And Sergeant O'Brian's daughter does all them cable movies. "
"Martin: Yeah, I heard. "
"Fred: You can pick her out, she's got his chin. "
"Martin: Yeah, could we just get on with it here? "
"Frasier: Dad, would you let me explain? "
"Martin: Frasier, look, I understand, I was in the army. We all have our urges. "
"Frasier: Yes, but you don't... "
"Fred: Just sign here. "
"Frasier: All that happened was... "
"Crystal: Bye, Dr. Crane, sorry I got you arrested. "
"Frasier: Oh, that's all right, Crystal, these things happen. "
"Frasier: He had a wig on "
"Martin: You're my son and I love you. "
"Frasier: Oh, will you stop saying that? "
"Martin: I still don't know what you were thinking. Middle of the night, deserted street, picking up a strange woman. "
"Niles: A VERY strange woman. "
"Frasier: Obviously I wasn't thinking. Thank God it's all over. I'll just spend a quiet weekend here with Frederick. Oh, dear God "
"Niles: 'Doc's Pal Is a Mock Gal' "
"Frasier: Oh, will this nightmare never end? Now, listen Dad, we're bound to get a lot of calls about this thing. Please do not answer the phone, don't talk to anybody, just let the machine get it. You don't want to give them anything they can turn into something tawdry... "
"Daphne: Yeah, I live with Dr. Crane. Yeah, there's quite a bit of massage involved. "
"Frasier: Daphne "
"Daphne: Mostly around the hips, thighs and buttocks. "
"Frasier: God Give me that No comment Oh, Daphne, please don't answer the phone, let the machine pick up. "
"Daphne: Yeah, well the machine's filled up. Everyone's been calling. "
"Frasier: Oh, where's Frederick? "
"Daphne: He's still asleep. Look, Dr. Crane, I just wanted to say you're the victim here. "
"Frasier: Thank you. "
"Daphne: Yeah, American society's so close-minded when it comes to sexual experimentation. In Europe... "
"Frasier: Daphne, I didn't do anything wrong "
"Daphne: Well, exactly That's what I'm trying to say "
"Frasier: Oh, I guess I deserve all this. I certainly had enough warning to stop being such a Boy Scout, but did I listen? No. Well, from now on, Dr. Crane – or as Seattle now knows him, 'Dr. Strangelove' - is out of the Samaritan business. "
"Frasier: Thank you, Niles. "
"Niles: Frasier, have you given much thought about what you're going to tell Frederick? "
"Frasier: Oh, God. How can I possibly explain it to him? Well, I guess the key is not to be evasive. He's going to hear about it sooner or later, I guess it should be from me. "
"Frasier: After all, I am a trained professional, I can do it in a way that won't traumatize the child. [seeing Freddie reach for the paper, he bellows] FREDDIE, DON'T TOUCH THAT "
"Martin: You know, I could use a glass of orange juice. I think I'm gonna go in the kitchen get a glass. "
"Niles: Oh, orange juice, yum. I'm going to come with you for that. "
"Freddie: Am I having another surprise party? "
"Frasier: No, no, Frederick. Here, sit down for a second, son. I, I've got something I've gotta talk to you about. For the next couple of days, you're going to hear some rather nasty stories and some snide jokes about your old man... "
"Freddie: Mom's coming? "
"Frasier: No, no she's not. It's very hard for me to tell you this, but I just spent the night in jail. "
"Freddie: Wow Like Brad Johnson's dad. "
"Frasier: Well, that was different. Insider trading is wrong. "
"Freddie: What did you do? "
"Frasier: Well, I saw a woman standing in the rain and I gave her a ride. "
"Freddie: You can go to jail for that? "
"Frasier: Well, it depends on the sort of woman. You see, this particular woman, this uh, person was a prostitute. But I didn't know that until it was too late. "
"Freddie: A prostitute? "
"Frasier: Oh God, how can I explain this? A prostitute is someone who engages in sexual relations with other people for money. "
"Freddie: Dad, I'm eleven. I know what a prostitute is. But, why did you pick one up? "
"Frasier: Well, you see, I didn't know that it was a prostitute at the time. I was only trying to do a good deed. Well, I suppose in hindsight it was all a big mistake. I should have minded my own business. "
"Freddie: So what are you trying to say, Dad? You shouldn't try to help people? "
"Frasier: Well... "
"TO: "
"Frasier: May I offer you a ride? "
"Woman: Oh, thank you. "
"Laura: I waved at you a couple of times, but I didn't think you saw me. "
"Frasier: Yes, well I noticed you, I was just having sort of a bad daydream. So, where can I take you? "
"Laura: Same place you're going. "
"Frasier: Oh, dear God. You're... "
"Laura: Laura Hilton. I live in your building. "
"Frasier: Of course, Laura. Hi. "
"Laura: I'm so glad you stopped when you did. "
"Frasier: Oh, I'm certainly glad I stopped too. "

"Frasier: Go ahead, Sophie, I'm listening. "
"Sophie: Hi, Dr. Crane. My husband's having some of his friends over to watch the game Sunday, and I think it'd be nice if I could have some of my girlfriends over too. "
"Frasier: Sounds reasonable. "
"Sophie: Exactly. I mean, it's just football. "
"Larry: Not football, Einstein, the Super Bowl. "
"Frasier: Ah, that would be your doting husband now. "
"Sophie: Larry, this is a private conversation. And for God's sake, use a plate "
"Frasier: Sophie, why don't you put your husband on the line? "
"Sophie: Pick up. "
"Larry: Ah, geez. Hello "
"Frasier: Larry, I gotta tell you, I'm afraid I side with your wife on this one. "
"Larry: That just proves you don't know the first thing about football. "
"Frasier: What I do or do not know about football has... "
"Larry: OK, how's "
"this: My wife's friends can come over if you can answer even one little football question. Like... "
"Frasier: Now, I don't see that that's in any... "
"Larry: You're down by six, you're on your own forty, three seconds left, what do you do? "
"Frasier: Well, all right, you would... "
"Frasier: You would take your receivers, and line them up, and then throw a pass. A long, long pass. "
"Larry: Yeah, and what's the name for that? "
"Frasier: A Hail Mary. Sophie and Larry, I hope you enjoy the game. In the meanwhile, this is Coach Crane saying, I'm listening. "
"Roz: I'm impressed you're so good at charades. "
"Frasier: I'm impressed you could mime a virgin. So, Roz, you walkin' out? "
"Roz: No, I got stuff I gotta do. I've got some carts to rack, and I want to put together some Best of Crane tapes. "
"Frasier: Oh, your mother's still in town? "
"Roz: In town, in my apartment, and when I left this morning, in my refrigerator, smelling my milk "
"Frasier: Oh, lord. "
"Roz: I, I love her, I just wish I could get a couple of hours to myself one night. "
"Frasier: Well, why don't you just ask her? She might enjoy a little time to herself. I know my dad does. "
"Roz: You are so lucky. I wish my mother drank alone. "
"Frasier: You know, Roz, your mom's about the same age as my dad, isn't she? "
"Roz: Yeah, I guess. "
"Frasier: Does she date much? "
"Roz: Since my father left, practically never... no, hang on... "
"Frasier: No, no, hear me out, Roz. Now, Dad hasn't dated anybody since he and Sherry broke up, I'm starting to worry he's lost his nerve. A date with your mom could be a tremendous favor to him. "
"Roz: I don't know. "
"Frasier: Oh, come on, I'll tell you "
"what: I know it's awkward but there's a way to minimize that. Niles and I are having dinner with him tonight. We'll take him to McGinty's, he'll feel comfortable, you and your mother can just happen by. We'll see what transpires, you know, they'll never even know it's a fix-up. "
"Roz: Oh, what the hell, I'll give it a shot, I guess. How's five sound? "
"Frasier: Five? Your mother is ready for dinner at five? "
"Roz: I keep her on Wisconsin time, that way she's in bed by eight. "
"Martin: Hey, look what I got here, boys A Funion Onion. The chef sent it over with his compliments. "
"Frasier: I wonder what his insults are like. "
"Martin: Hey, Bonnie "
"Bonnie: Hey ya, Marty. Oh, you must be Frasier, the big radio star. "
"Frasier: Oh, yes. Hello. "
"Bonnie: Your dad is so proud of you, he talks about you all the time. Who's your friend? "
"Martin: Now, what's wrong with you? I told you about my other son. "
"Bonnie: Oh, of course, what am I thinking? Nice to meet you, Eddie. "
"Martin: This is Niles. How 'bout some beers, Bonnie? "
"Bonnie: Coming right up. "
"Niles: Oh God, look. The group coming in the door, they're from the Shangri-La. "
"Jimbo: Whoa, it's the Coyote "
"Niles: Evening, evening, Jimbo. Check you later. "
"Martin: Wow, you got a nickname down there already. That's great The Coyote? "
"Niles: Yes. "
"Frasier: And how did you earn that honorific? "
"Niles: Oh, it was quite the merry road. Yes. It evolved from Niles to Nilesy to Niley to Nile E. Coyote and now simply 'The Coyote.' "
"Niles: Oh, well, just when I thought it couldn't be refined any further. "
"Frasier: Oh, goodness, look who's here Roz "
"Roz: What? We don't see enough of each other during the day? "
"Frasier: Hello, Joanna. "
"Joanna: Nice to see you again, Frasier. "
"Frasier: Nice to see you again, too. Please, won't you sit down and join us? "
"Joanna: Oh, no, we don't want to intrude. "
"Frasier: Oh, no, no, please, the more the merrier. "
"Roz: All right. Mom, this is Frasier's dad, Martin Crane. This is my mom, Joanna Doyle. "
"Martin: Very nice to meet you. And this is my other son, Niles. "
"Niles: How do you do? "
"Joanna: It's a pleasure. "
"TO: after dinner. Martin and Joanna have cleaned their "
"Frasier: Roz, will you just look at the two of them. "
"Roz: How did you two manage to finish all that? "
"Joanna: Oh, please. This is how our generation ate every day. I used to live on cigarettes, whiskey sours and bacon cheeseburgers. "
"Martin: Yeah, and what about breakfast? Fried eggs, sausage patties, hash browns... "
"Niles: My God, last night I ate a profiterole and lay awake 'til dawn waiting for my heart attack. "
"Joanna: Those were simpler times, weren't they, Marty? "
"Martin: Oh yeah, we didn't worry about dumb things like cholesterol. We worried about puttin' food on the table, keepin' the yard clean and the car shiny. "
"Joanna: And the H-bomb. "
"Martin: Well, yeah, that. "
"Frasier: Say, Roz, we better be going if we're going to get that work done tonight. "
"Niles: Oh, I should be going too. "
"Roz: Mom and me are going to that jazz club on Fifth. "
"Frasier: But we promised to finish those promos tonight. "
"Roz: Oh, right. Mom, I'm sorry, I totally forgot. "
"Joanna: It's OK. "
"Frasier: Wait, I've got an idea. Uh, Dad, since I'm kidnapping Roz, why don't you take Joanna to the jazz club? "
"Martin: Well, sure, I'd love to. "
"Roz: Is that OK with you, Mom? "
"Joanna: If Martin's game, I'm game. "
"Frasier: Oh, well, perfect. OK, you kids just have some coffee, we'll see you back at the apartment later, OK? "
"Joanna: All right. "
"Niles: Very, very nice to meet you. "
"Joanna: Thank you. "
"Joanna: Look at them. They think we don't know this is a setup. "
"Martin: Well, how could we figure it out? We're just a retired detective and an attorney general. "
"TO: Roz and Frasier by the bar. "
"Roz: You were absolutely right, they didn't suspect a thing. "
"Frasier: I told you Roz, just leave it to the master. "
"Roz: God, I thought they'd be home by now. "
"Frasier: Roz, will you please relax and watch the pageant with us? They're right in the middle of the talent competition. "
"Daphne: It's shameless the way they're sucking up to the international panel of judges. Miss Germany just played 'Lady of Spain' on a French horn. "
"Frasier: Roz, you're gonna chew that nail right off. Stop it. "
"Roz: I can't help it. I'm nervous. Do you think it's gonna turn out OK? "
"Frasier: Who cares? "
"Daphne: Not for Miss Brazil. Look at the tree trunks on her. She's her own little rain forest. "
"Roz: I just keep worrying that she's gonna have a lousy time, and it will be all my fault. Screwing up, like always. "
"Frasier: Oh, come on, Roz. Your mother doesn't think you're a screwup. "
"Roz: Oh, yeah? In high school, I ran my own informal shoplifting clinic. In college, I dropped out of pre-law because it interfered with Bruce Springsteen's touring schedule. And now I'm an unwed mother. What would you call me? "
"Daphne: Tramp. "
"Frasier: Daphne "
"Daphne: It's Miss Venezuela. If that dress of hers was slit any higher, you could see Caracas. "
"Frasier: Oh, oh, Roz. You know what? So what if they don't get along? So we made a mistake. "
"Roz: You don't understand. My mother doesn't make mistakes. She does everything well. She's smart, successful, classy... oh, what the hell was I thinking? "
"Frasier: About what? Setting her up with my father? "
"Roz: No, that's not what I meant. "
"Frasier: That is exactly what you meant "
"Roz: Well, OK, Frasier. No offense, your father is a very nice man, but let's face "
"it: My mother was the attorney general of Wisconsin. "
"Frasier: Well I hope he remembers to curtsey before the Dairy Queen "
"Daphne: This is ridiculous. I'm going to watch this in my room. Miss Finland just laid out her plan to end world hunger, and I missed it "
"Frasier: Oh, lord. "
"Frasier: Oh, Roz, that is the best promo of all. "
"Roz: Oh, hi How was your evening? "
"Joanna: Oh, the jazz was first rate. But I'm afraid I talked Martin's ear off. "
"Martin: Oh, you're crazy. Your mother tells wonderful stories, Roz. I could have listened to her all night. "
"Joanna: You are either too kind or a little tipsy. But thank you. Come on, Lammy. I really had a lovely time. "
"Martin: Well, I can't remember when I had a better time. We're gonna have to do this again. "
"Joanna: Bye, Frasier. "
"Frasier: Goodnight, Joanna. Lammy. "
"Frasier: So... Tell me all about it. "
"Martin: Well, being a gentleman, I don't want to go into the details, so suffice it to say, it STUNK "
"Frasier: What? "
"Martin: That was the dullest evening of my life. The way she drones on and on. Do you know how many metric tons of eggs Wisconsin produces every year? "
"Frasier: No. "
"Martin: Well, I do "
"Frasier: Oh... "
"Martin: Look, Frasier, I know you meant well, but if you ever set me up again, I'll kill you in your sleep. Goodnight. "
"Roz: I told my mom to meet me downstairs. I just had to come up and tell you. She had the best time She can't wait to go out with your father again. Will you tell him to call her tomorrow? Oh, Frasier, this whole thing worked out like a dream "
"Martin: It's amazing Her voice is still echoing in my head "
"Frasier: Yes, it's like a fairy tale over here, too. "
"Frasier: I've just got to find some way to tell Roz. "
"Niles: Why? It's just going to hurt her mom's feelings. "
"Frasier: Her feelings are going to be hurt anyway. She's here 'til Sunday. She's expecting him to call. Oh, dear God. At least this way Roz can let her down easy. "
"Niles: Looks like both of us have difficult conversations ahead of us. "
"Frasier: What's yours? "
"Niles: All week long, I have been getting less coffee and more foam in my cappuccino. It's about time for someone to raise a little hell. Who's on steamer duty? "
"Frasier: Well, it's that hulking fellow, Thad. The one who doesn't react when his arm touches the steamer nozzle. "
"Niles: Where is that suggestion box? "
"Roz: Oh, hey Frasier. "
"Frasier: Hi, Roz. "
"Roz: Double espresso to go, please. Listen, I really need to thank you again. My mother had the best time last night. And when we got home, WE started talking. We ended up staying up half the night. "
"Frasier: Oh, Roz I'm glad for you, but... "
"Roz: It was like a wall came down. She just opened up to me. She started talking about how hard it was on her when my dad left, and how lonely she's been, and it was like she was talking to a girlfriend instead of her screw-up daughter. So, has Martin called her yet? "
"Frasier: No. But he will. Soon. Uh, he had a really busy morning. "
"Roz: Well, how does this weekend look? 'Cause she's leaving Sunday night. "
"Frasier: Sunday? Oh, well let's see, tonight is poker night, that's no good. Saturday he's made plans to, uh, drive Duke to Tacoma for that all day... Tacoma-Fest. "
"Roz: Well, on Sunday we go to a matinee and then I drive her to the airport. "
"Frasier: Oh, darn. "
"Roz: Wait a minute. I can give my ticket to Martin and they can go together. "
"Frasier: No, no, Sunday's no good, because that's the, uh... "
"Roz: Oh right, it's the Super Bowl "
"Frasier: Right, the Super Bowl. You know how Dad is about football, it's like a religion with him. In fact, he's made Niles and I promise that we'd watch it with him this year. "
"Roz: Oh, well, OK. Let's just forget about the tickets and we'll come over and watch the game. Is there any reason why that won't work? "
"Frasier: Not that I can come up with. "
"Roz: That's great, my mom's going to be so excited. [She turns to pay her bill, Niles takes it and puts it on the counter.] Oh, thank you, Niles. I'll see you Sunday at your Super Bowl party. "
"Niles: I see you told Roz the news and she went insane. "
"Frasier: Couldn't do it. Told her we were watching the Super Bowl with Dad and she and her mother are coming over. "
"Niles: This is a nightmare "
"Frasier: I know. I've got to find some way to tell Dad. "
"Niles: I have to watch the Super Bowl? "
"Frasier: I suppose the sooner I tell him, the better. "
"Niles: Oh, not necessarily. "
"Frasier: What do you mean? "
"Niles: Well, you know Dad. If you warn him Joanna's coming over, he'll just bolt to McGinty's. If I were you, I'd wait until five minutes before game time and then spring it on him. That way he has no choice but to stay. "
"Frasier: I think I owe him more than five minutes' warning. Besides, Dad would never deliberately hurt Joanna standing her up. He is first and foremost a gentleman. "
"Martin: I saw Roz, so I hid outside in case that old gasbag of a mother was with her. Well, I guess she wasn't, everybody's still awake. "
"Martin: Look at those guys in the locker room. Nervous, hearts pounding, probably a little sick to their stomachs, poor kids. "
"Frasier: Yes. Until I got out of high school, I didn't there was any other way to feel in a locker room. "
"Martin: What's the matter with you? You keep looking at your watch. "
"Frasier: Was I? "
"Martin: Yeah. Is there something on your mind? "
"Frasier: No, no, but there's something I wanted to talk to you about, but now's not the time. "
"Frasier: Now's the time. "
"Martin: Just let me get the door. "
"Frasier: No, Dad, Dad, that's what I have to talk to you about. You see, that's going to be Roz and her mother. "
"Martin: What? "
"Frasier: Well, Joanna had such a good time with you the other night, and you did say that you would see her again, and rather than send her home with her feelings hurt, I had to tell her you wanted her here. "
"Martin: What, like a date? "
"Frasier: Well, that's the beauty of it. It's like a date, but it's not a date. Just, you know, make small talk, you pass the dip. "
"Martin: No, Frasier, you don't understand... "
"Frasier: Now, Dad, I know you found her a little less than scintillating, but please, it'll be over before you know it. "
"Bonnie: Hey, Frasier. "
"Frasier: Hi, Bonnie. "
"Bonnie: Martin. "
"Martin: Hey, Bonnie, glad you could make it. Let me hold this. See, this is what I was trying to tell you, Frasier, I invited Bonnie. "
"Frasier: Oh, how nice. "
"Martin: Well, what do you got here? "
"Bonnie: Oh, it's my special deviled ham in the shape of a football. But I still need to put on some macaroni laces. "
"Martin: Oh, the kitchen's right down there, just holler if you need anything. "
"Frasier: What did you invite her for? "
"Martin: Well, because I like her, and I thought I might want to ask her out, and I thought if she came over for the game it might be a step in the right direction. I mean 'like a date but not a date.' "
"Frasier: Now that's gonna be Roz and her mother. "
"Bonnie: Should I put some coffee on while I'm in here? "
"Martin: You better, we're gonna need it. "
"Frasier: Would you come on, Dad? Would it kill you to be civil for the length of one Super Bowl? What is that, an hour out of your life? "
"Martin: Hi Sorry. Come on in. "
"Joanna: Thanks so much for inviting us. "
"Martin: Wouldn't be fun without you. "
"Roz: Frasier, could you show Mom where Alice can finish her nap? "
"Frasier: I'm sure Dad would love to. "
"Martin: My pleasure, just come this way, Joanna. So, you a big football fan? "
"Joanna: No, actually I've never even seen a game. I was hoping you'd explain as we go along. "
"Bonnie: OK, who's hungry? Oh, hey, I'm Bonnie. "
"Roz: Hi, from McGinty's. I didn't know you were coming. "
"Bonnie: Yeah, Martin invited me. He was real cute about it. He checked with all the waitresses to find out if I was single. "
"Roz: Oh. "
"Frasier: Yes, well you know how Dad is always trying to, ah... "
"Bonnie: Hey, the Coyote "
"Frasier: Find a new girl for Niles. Niles, you remember Bonnie. She waited on us at McGinty's. "
"Niles: Oh, of course. I'll have a vodka martini, very dry. "
"Frasier: Don't be silly, Niles. Bonnie is here as our guest. "
"Roz: Yeah, your dad thought you two might hit it off. "
"Niles: Oh. "
"Bonnie: Oh. "
"Niles: The Superbowl and a date. Hot diggity "
"Bonnie: Well, come here, you're just in time for my specialty. "
"Niles: Oh, I... Mmmm Isn't that interesting Something formerly ham. "
"Daphne: Well, I'm off to the cinema. "
"Niles: You're not staying for the game? "
"Daphne: Sorry, but Ameican football's not for me, and they're showing 'Wuthering Heights' downtown. I think it's the most romantic movie ever made. "
"Niles: You're going alone? "
"Daphne: Yes, unfortunately. It's more fun to go with someone, except of course it always ends the same "
"way: Me weeping all over me date's shoulder while he does what he can to comfort me. "
"Bonnie: Oh, you should have seen me cry putting onions in this ham loaf. I must've gone through a whole roll of toilet paper. "
"Daphne: Well, enjoy your game. "
"Niles: Frasier, may I see you in the kitchen? "
"Martin: That's amazing You do all you do and you still have time to be a docent at the cheese museum on the weekends? Frasier, can I see you in the kitchen? "
"Frasier: Just a second, Dad, I gotta take drink orders in here. "
"Niles: Thanks for setting me up with that Spam-happy tootsy. "
"Martin: What are you talking about? "
"Niles: Bonnie. Frasier told me you invited her here for me. "
"Martin: I invited her here for me. He probably said I invited her for you because he didn't want to upset Miss Boring's feelings. "
"Frasier: Now, now, no private conversations. Your dates are waiting. "
"Martin: They're not our dates "
"Niles: We hate them "
"Frasier: Now listen. I realize that this is a very difficult situation, but if we all cooperate, we can send everybody home happy. Dad, if you would like, you can discretely take Bonnie aside and tell her what's going on. "
"Martin: Bonnie, can I tell you something? "
"Frasier: I said DISCRETELY "
"Joanna: I think the game is about to start. "
"Roz: Oh, that reminds me, I want to get Alice's bottle warming. "
"Bonnie: Oh, you have a baby? "
"Joanna: Oh, the most adorable little girl. "
"Martin: Oh, she's a real beaut You oughta see her, Bonnie. "
"Roz: You can come with me if you want when I feed her. "
"Martin: No, you go ahead and get that ready, I'll show Bonnie, it's right through there. "
"Frasier: Now, Dad, don't you get fresh with Niles's girl, there. "
"Martin: Oh, I won't if he won't. "
"Joanna: Your father is really smitten with that baby, isn't he? "
"Roz: I think he's just got a weak spot for the Doyle women. "
"Joanna: Oh. "
"Frasier: Yes, well, he may appear to have a crusty exterior, but deep down inside, Dad's just an old softy. "
"Martin: Well, there's the kid. Kind of a goony-looking thing, isn't she? "
"Niles: Is that Dad? "
"Martin: Look, Bonnie, I gotta tell you somethin'. I didn't ask you here for Niles, I asked you here for me. "
"Frasier: It's the baby monitor We should just... "
"Joanna: Shh. I want to hear this. "
"Bonnie: But I thought you were with Joanna. "
"Martin: No, no. Frasier and Roz set us up last week. I told Frasier I thought she was a big snooze. Especially compared to the fun you and I have at the bar, but he stuck me with her again. "
"Frasier: You know, I bet they know it's on... "
"Roz: Yeah. "
"Frasier: And they're just having some fun with us... "
"Roz: Yeah. "
"Joanna: Frasier, just stay put. "
"Bonnie: Then Niles isn't my date? Oh, there's a relief. I mean, no offense, Marty, but... "
"Martin: Hey, you don't have to tell me. "
"Niles: OK. If anybody wants me, I'll be at the movies. "
"Bonnie: So you really like me? You're not just pulling my leg? "
"Martin: You want proof? "
"Joanna: I think we can turn this off now. "
"Frasier: Joanna, I am so sorry. I know it sounded bad, but... "
"Joanna: No, no, not at all. I'm sure your father meant 'big snooze' in the most flattering sense. Roz, maybe we should leave. "
"Roz: What were you thinking? "
"Frasier: Oh, Roz, I certainly wasn't thinking that he had a date planned. "
"Roz: I'm just going to get Alice. Mom, I'm so sorry. "
"Joanna: Believe me. Twenty years in politics, I've been called worse things than boring. "
"Joanna: Well, I hope you'll understand if I just slip out without saying goodbye to Martin? "
"Frasier: Of course, Joanna. The last thing we need today is another awkward situation. "
"Martin: Whoa-ho-ho, Roz Knock, will ya? "
"Roz: I left my diaper bag. "
"Frasier: Right. Can you come in for a bit? "
"Roz: I really shouldn't. "
"Frasier: Roz, I'm so sorry. "
"Roz: It's all right. I mean, I'm not gonna say that my mother wasn't hurt, but she did start to smile a little bit about it on the way to the airport. "
"Frasier: You know, I've been sitting here, trying to figure out why I was so eager to play matchmaker for Dad. "
"Roz: Oh, you're not alone. I mean, I was excited once I thought it was going well. "
"Frasier: Well, I suspect I wasn't doing it so much for him as I was doing it for me. I see him here all the time, all alone, I wonder if maybe that's not gonna be me someday. "
"Roz: Oh, God. I think the same thing sometimes when I see these older ladies in my building. They all want to babysit Alice just for the company. I mean, she's a cute baby, but she ain't no Dorthy Parker. "
"Frasier: Ah, well, we're both gonna be fine. I was just thinking, though, if we wanna play it safe, we could make one of those, uh, pacts. "
"Roz: You mean, like in forty years, if neither one of us finds anyone... "
"Frasier: Yeah, exactly, we'll marry each other. "
"Roz: I was gonna say kill each other. "
"Frasier: Well, six of one... "

"Audrey: So, Dr Crane, I don't see why I should fix the dumb dress when my sister can't even fit into it anymore. "
"Frasier: Audrey, you borrowed the dress, you tore it. As an old Greek haberdasher once "
"said: 'Euripedes, Eumenides.' "
"Audrey: What? "
"Frasier: It's just a little joke on the ancient dramatist Euripedes and the mythological Furies. "
"Audrey: Huh? "
"Frasier: Just fix the dress. We'll be back after the weather. "
"Frasier: Uh Roz, Noel gave me this to give to you. "
"Roz: Oh God, Noel. He's been acting so weird lately. "
"Frasier: Lately? May I remind you this is the man required by law to stay at least 100 yards away from William Shatner? "
"Roz: No, I bumped into him at Nervosa about a month ago, there were no other free tables so we sat together and ever since then he's been acting like we're some kind of a couple. "
"Frasier: Oh come on, Roz. I'm sure he knows that you're not interested in him. "
"Roz: 'Happy Monthaversary.' "
"Frasier: Oh, Lord. And we're back, let's get straight to the phones. I'm listening. "
"Woody: Dr Crane? It's Woody. I'm in Seattle and I'm a little lost. "
"Frasier: Well Woody, in today's fast-paced, high-pressure society that's not uncommon. Just why exactly do you feel lost? "
"Woody: Well, I've been driving around for about an hour, I can't seem to get out of the airport. "
"Frasier: Oh, Woody Woody. Oh well, listeners, this is an old friend of mine from back in Boston. Well, how you doin' there, you old cowpoke? "
"Woody: I was doing okay, but all this talk about today's fast-paced, high-pressure world's starting to get me down. "
"Frasier: Yes, well I have just the cure for that. How about dinner? "
"Woody: Sounds great. I'm in town all week. "
"Frasier: And I'm free all week. How's tonight? "
"Woody: That'd be great. So I hear you're on the radio? "
"Frasier: Yes I am, Woody. And so are you. "
"Woody: No, no, no. I'm still tending bar at Cheers. How do these rumors get started? "
"Frasier: Believe it or not, listeners, Woody and I are picking up right where we left off. "
"Noel: Knock knock? "
"Roz: Noel... "
"Noel: Oh, I haven't seen that outfit before, set your phasers on stunning. "
"Roz: Listen, I need to talk to you. I can not accept anniversary gifts. "
"Noel: Oh, I know that. I was just making a little joke. I know we're just friends. I saw this and it made me think of you. "
"Roz: Okay. Thanks. "
"Noel: Oh, if you're not going to open it for a while, you might want to move the the ribbon. It's blocking the air holes. "
"Daphne: Here. I made you some lamb stew. "
"Martin: I'm telling you, there's something weird about Eddie. "
"Daphne: Oh, for the love of God, not this again. "
"Martin: You never should have taken him to those dog groomers. "
"Daphne: I had to bring him. His toenails were like Howard Hughes's and his breath smelled like an autopsy. "
"Martin: Well, look at him. They did something to him. The sparkle's gone from his eyes. "
"Daphne: Yes, and so are those gooey green bits. "
"Frasier: Oh. That's probably Woody. I'll get it. Oh, Niles. "
"Niles: Hello, Frasier. I know this is impromptu, but I'm going to an oboe recital and I thought you might want to join me. "
"Frasier: Well, I'm sorry, Niles. An old friend of mine came in from out of town, I invited him to come over this evening. "
"Niles: Well, have him join us. I'm sure we can get three seats together. "
"Frasier: Ah well, I'm not sure an oboe recital's what I had in mind, I was thinking of something a little more raucous. "
"Niles: Well, if it's raucous you're looking for, we could go and get a nightcap at the piano bar at the Mayflower Hotel - It's Jerome Kern night Last time people were shouting out requests without raising their hands "
"Frasier: No, I'm afraid we'll have to pass. You see, my friend Woody is an old bar chum from back at Cheers. [the doorbell bing bongs. Frasier goes to answer it] What I had in mind was really more of a beer-swillin', back-slappin' kind of night, if you know what I mean? You're certainly welcome to join us if you like. "
"Niles: It sounds interesting. "
"Frasier: All right. Woody? "
"Woody: Hey, Dr Crane "
"Frasier: Good to see ya. "
"Woody: You look great. "
"Frasier: Well thank you, thanks. You too. "
"Woody: Aah, this place is awesome. "
"Frasier: Thank you. "
"Woody: I'm not surprised you need all these roommates to help you pay for it. "
"Frasier: Er, they're not really roommates, Woody. They're... they're more like boarders actually. That's my father, Martin. "
"Woody: Well, hi. I remember hearing about you, you were a policeman, right? "
"Martin: That's right. "
"Frasier: And that's my brother right there, Niles. He's a psychiatrist too. "
"Niles: Hello. "
"Woody: Oh, wow "
"Frasier: And this is Daphne Moon, my father's home health-care worker. "
"Daphne: It's nice to meet you. "
"Woody: Oh hi. I like your accent. Aah, you're from England, right? "
"Daphne: Manchester. "
"Woody: Darn I'm usually pretty good at that. Oh hey, who's this little guy? "
"Martin: I'm not sure I even know anymore. "
"Woody: My dad's getting the same way. "
"Frasier: So Woody, can I get you a beer? "
"Woody: That's funny, huh? Y'know, all those years I was waiting on you, and now you're getting me a beer. "
"Frasier: Yes well, life's like that sometimes, isn't it? Daphne, get us a couple of beers, will ya? [Daphne goes to kitchen, not happily] So, what brings you to Seattle? "
"Woody: My cousin's getting married. "
"Frasier: Really? "
"Niles: Which is your cousin, the bride or the groom? "
"Woody: Actually, both are. "
"Niles: I assume they're kissing cousins? "
"Woody: Ho, they're doing a lot more than that That's why they have to get married. "
"Frasier: So, is Kelly with you? "
"Woody: No no, she's visiting her mom with the kids, but she sends her love. "
"Frasier: And how's the old gang? "
"Woody: Oh well, they haven't changed much. Sam's doing great, Carla's terrific... oh, y'know, we almost had a wedding. Mr. Clavin got himself one of those Eastern European mail-order brides, but ah, they lived together for a couple of days, and decided to call it off. "
"Frasier: Oh, gosh. I'm so sorry for Cliff. "
"Woody: Yeah. She said she was homesick. That Bosnia must be a beautiful place. "
"Daphne: Here we are. "
"Frasier: Oh thank you, Daphne. "
"Daphne: That's one for you, one for you, and [opens can and heads towards Martin. Sits down] one for me. "
"Frasier: Well Woody, I thought tonight we would just maybe stay in, y'know, order some pizza? "
"Woody: Sounds good by me. "
"Frasier: Okay, great. I'll just call the place around the corner. Niles you uh, gonna join us? "
"Niles: Well, why not? It'll be fun to drink some beer and have some pizza with a couple of rapscallions. "
"Woody: Oh hey, if you don't mind, could we make that half rapscallions, half pepperoni? "
"TO: "
"Woody: That wasn't the best prank we played. You remember that time with Mr. Clavin? "
"Frasier: Oh yes. And the ferret [more laughter; Daphne and Martin look on, obviously not understanding.] "
"Woody: He was about to go on his round and we shoved an angry ferret into his mailbag. "
"Niles: Oh, my. Exactly, ahh, how do you make a ferret angry? "
"Woody: Well, for starters, you shove him into a mailbag. "
"Frasier: God, that was funny. Do you remember the expression on his face? "
"Woody: Y'know, I never saw his face. I was too busy looking at Mr. Clavin. "
"Frasier: Woody, let me get you another cold one. "
"Woody: Oh, thanks. "
"Frasier: My god. I tell ya, this has just been the best evening. My God, it's like re-living all my old days at Cheers, only without Lilith. Boy, that's a trip to Bountiful, let me tell ya. "
"Martin: These guys are really getting through the beers, aren't they? "
"Daphne: Oh, yes. If this keeps up, you may have to fish out that emergency can you keep in the toilet tank. "
"Frasier: There you are, Woods. "
"Woody: Well, y'know what, on second thought I think I'm gonna pass. I'm feeling a little bit jet-lagged. "
"Frasier: Well, all right, you want to call it a night? "
"Woody: You know, I probably should. But this was so much fun. I'd really like to do it again. "
"Frasier: Well, all right, how about lunch tomorrow? "
"Woody: Oh yeah, that sounds great. "
"Frasier: Okay. "
"Woody: Hey, goodbye y'all, nice to meet you. "
"Martin: Oh hey, you too. Come back. "
"Frasier: You know what, Woody? There's a new gourmet Mexican restaurant over near your hotel I'd love to try. It's called 'Dos Burros.' It sounds muy delicioso. "
"Woody: I didn't know you speak Spanish? "
"Frasier: Ohh, it's nothing. "
"Woody: I know ahh, 'dos' means two, what does 'burro' mean? "
"Frasier: Same as in English, Jackass. "
"Woody: Sorry, just asking. "
"TO: "
"Martin: Hey guys, how was lunch? "
"Woody: Oh, great. We told one old story, we told a hundred. Hey, how you doin', little guy? "
"Martin: His name's Eddie. "
"Woody: Hey, good for you, Mr Crane. They have good days, and they have bad days. "
"Frasier: Woody, here's that Seattle guidebook I was telling you about, right here. "
"Woody: Oh, thanks. "
"Frasier: Take a loan of that, huh? "
"Woody: Wow, look at that view, you can see the whole city. "
"Frasier: Woody, turn around, it's even better. "
"Woody: Gosh. You're right, this is better. "
"Frasier: No, no Woody, look up. "
"Woody: OHH. You mind if I go out there? "
"Frasier: No, no. You go ahead. "
"Woody: Remember the time we went out on the balcony of Melville's and threw pudding? "
"Frasier: I don't think I laughed harder in my entire life "
"Frasier: Put a bullet in my head. "
"Martin: What's going on? "
"Frasier: My God. I have absolutely nothing in common with this man, except things that happened ten years ago. "
"Martin: But I thought you had a fun time last night. "
"Frasier: Oh well, yes. We had exactly the same time this afternoon, it wasn't nearly as fun. The same stories, and variations thereof, being forced to laugh over and over. I swear, if I never get another shoulder noogie I will die a happy man. "
"Martin: Oh, don't feel bad. You've been a good friend and you've shown him a nice time, and now all that's left is for you to go in there and tell him goodbye. "
"Frasier: Yes, I guess when all this is over I'll have learned a valuable lesson. Sometimes you can have too much of a good thing. You have to know when to say 'When.' The past is just that, the past. You can never go home again. Less is more. "
"Martin: Wish you had started with that last one. "
"Frasier: Well, Woods? It's been great seeing you. "
"Woody: Oh yeah, hey. "
"Frasier: C'mon, gimme a good hug, ah? Now you gotta promise me you're gonna give my love to everybody back at the bar. "
"Woody: Oh, I will. "
"Frasier: Oh, and give that beautiful wife of yours and those two kids a kiss from Uncle Frasier. "
"Woody: You got it. "
"Frasier: Now don't be a stranger, okay? "
"Woody: No, I won't, I won't. where are we going for dinner tonight? "
"Frasier: Niles. "
"Niles: Frasier. Odd to see you without Woody in tow. He off teasing ferrets? "
"Frasier: Niles, listen, uh, I've been having such a great time with Woody, I was wondering, y'know, maybe tonight you'd like to join us? We've planned to go out... "
"Niles: You can save it. Dad brought me up to speed with your reunion of the damned. "
"Frasier: Oh, God. "
"Niles: I would love to help, I'm sorry, you're on your own. "
"Frasier: No, no, no, please, Niles, really, I'm desperate. Do you have any idea how difficult it is to feign interest in the same old stories over and over again? "
"Niles: And you call yourself a psychiatrist? You wouldn't last a week in private practice. "
"Frasier: Ooh. "
"Niles: Speaking of which, my six o'clock is waiting. "
"Waiter: Triple espresso to go. "
"Niles: Thank you. "
"Frasier: Niles? Please? Please, I need you. It's going to be an excruciating journey into... Ohh... [notices Roz is standing beside him] Roz Hey, you know what, are you up for a night on the town? "
"Roz: This wouldn't be the invitation that Niles just blew off, would it? "
"Frasier: Oh, all right Here, please. My old friend Woody is dragging me out again tonight. I could really use a buffer. He's taking me to some God-awful karaoke bar. "
"Roz: Are you gonna sing? "
"Frasier: No "
"Roz: Okay, I'll go. "
"Frasier: Really, you will? "
"Roz: I had a babysitter tonight, my plans fell through, karaoke might be fun. "
"Gil: Karaoke? Tonight? Oh, I'd love to. "
"Frasier: Well Gil, I'm not sure you'd enjoy this. "
"Gil: Oh nonsense. If we're going to the one on Pike, I keep a locker there where I store my own microphone and show jackets. "
"Noel: Hey, guys. Hi, Roz. "
"Frasier: Hi, Noel. "
"Noel: I see you're at... our table. "
"Gil: 'Our table'? Ooh, is there an office romance brewing? "
"Roz: No, Gil. We're just friends, right Noel? "
"Noel: So far. "
"Gil: Well, who knows what the night has in store? We're all going for karaoke. Why don't you join us? "
"Noel: Count me in. "
"Roz: Is that my beeper? "
"Frasier: I didn't hear anything. "
"Roz: Oh my God "
"Frasier: Roz "
"Roz: It's the babysitter, she only calls in an emergency. I have to go, bye TAXI "
"Frasier: Roz, wait "
"Noel: Roz, wait "
"Gil: Well, looks as it's just us boys. "
"TO: "
"Daphne: Oh, that was beautiful. "
"Martin: Yeah. You know Niles, that was the first movie I ever took your mother to see. I deliberately picked a tear jerker so I'd be there to comfort her. At the first sniffle, I was on her like an octopus. "
"Daphne: You men. You always find a way to make us more vulnerable to your clumsy advances. Ooh, that wine went straight to my head. "
"Niles: Let's kill off the bottle, shall we? "
"Martin: Hey, Fras. "
"Frasier: Turn off the music. "
"Martin: Oh. Well, we were just... "
"Frasier: Dad. I never want to hear music again. "
"Niles: Oh. I take it you had a whizz-bang time at the karaoke bar? "
"Frasier: For starters, Woody sang 'What Kind Of Fool Am I?' Quickly turned into an audience participation number. Then Gil and Noel did a charming duet with 'Anything You Can Do, I Can Do Better.' They were both wrong. I guess the highlight of the evening was when Gil, after one too many Que Royales, performed a haunting rendition of 'I Feel Pretty,' during the latter verses of which Noel joined him on the apron of the stage and translated... into Klingon. [he buries his head in his hands] Well, I think I'm just gonna go off to bed so I can get up bright and early for my harbour cruise with Woody tomorrow. "
"Martin: What? You're seeing him again? Why don't you tell the guy you're busy for once? "
"Frasier: Dad, he knows that I'm not. Besides, I'd hate to hurt his feelings, I'd hate to have him think I've outgrown him. "
"Niles: But you have. "
"Frasier: Well, that's the problem. I've moved on to bigger and better things in my life, he's still pouring drinks back in the same bar he's been at for the last fifteen years. Don't you think that's kinda sad? "
"Martin: If I were you I'd just lie to him. Tell him you have to work, or you met a pretty girl. "
"Daphne: Who's that pretty girl in the mirror there? What mirror, where? Who could that attractive girl be? Which, what, where, who? Who? "
"Martin: Daphne? "
"Daphne: Who? "
"Martin: Daphne? "
"Daphne: Wh.. "
"Frasier: DAPHNE "
"Martin: Bedtime. "
"Daphne: I used to be with a light opera works. "
"Frasier: Yes, fine, and I used to be a fan dancer Get out. Go to bed "
"Niles: She uh, seems a little wobbly, perhaps I should... "
"Frasier: Niles. "
"Niles: Ooh, surprise, guess who? "
"Frasier: Dear God I just left him. What moonlit berry-picking expedition does he have planned for me now? "
"Niles: Shhh. "
"Frasier: I can't take this anymore. All right, all right fine. I'm just going to have to lie to him. Woody "
"Woody: Hey, Dr Crane. Hey, everybody. Listen, I... when I got back to my hotel I called Kelly to say goodnight, and uh... it turns out our little girl has an ear infection, so I'm taking the Redeye right now and my cab is waiting for me downstairs. "
"Frasier: Oh well, Woody. I guess this means goodbye, then. "
"Woody: Yeah, I'm afraid so. "
"Frasier: All right then, give me a hug. You remember to give my love to the folks back at Cheers. "
"Woody: Oh, will do. "
"Frasier: Okay. I hope that little girl of yours gets better real soon. "
"Woody: Thank you. It was great spending time with you. "
"Frasier: Well, it was great seeing you too, Woody. "
"Woody: Yeah. "
"Frasier: It's a shame we have to cut it short. "
"Woody: It sure is. Well, goodbye. "
"Frasier: Goodbye, Wood. God bless the virus that invaded that little girl's ear canal. "
"Niles: Congratulations. I'll be off. "
"Frasier: Oh no. Niles, I'll tell you what, to celebrate my newfound freedom, why don't we go over to that little cantina I mentioned to you earlier, and I'll buy you a late supper? We'll have a margarita. "
"Niles: Thank you, Frasier. "
"Frasier: And after that, we'll go by that pricey new cigar club, it's my treat. "
"Niles: Well hey, big spender. "
"Frasier: Ohh... "
"Niles: Is everything all right? "
"Frasier: The last time I heard that phrase, Gil was belting it out while sitting on the lap of a Japanese businessman. Let's get that margarita. "
"TO: "
"Niles: Thank you. "
"Frasier: I think you'll like this place. "
"Niles: Well, I do already. N.M.B. "
"Frasier: N.M.B? "
"Niles: No Mariachi Band. "
"Frasier: Oh dear God. Quick, hide your face with your menu. Woody's over there. If he sees us he'll know I lied. "
"Niles: When did you lie? "
"Frasier: I told him I was going out of town. "
"Niles: No, you didn't. He told you he was going out of town. "
"Frasier: That's right. He lied. He should be hiding. Woody? Woody? "
"Frasier: For God's sake. Stay here. [he goes over to the restroom door only to find it locked] Woody. Come out of there, please. "
"Woody: No hablo ingles. "
"Frasier: I don't understand this. "
"Woody: It means I don't speak English. "
"Frasier: Will you just come out here? Woody? What is going on? "
"Woody: I can't even look at you. I'm so ashamed. I... I lied to you, Dr. Crane. "
"Frasier: Why did you do that? "
"Woody: Well, I guess I didn't want you to know it was me in the bathroom. "
"Frasier: No, Woody. Earlier this evening you told me you were going back to Boston. "
"Woody: Oh, well. I feel terrible saying this but, I just couldn't face another day of us hanging out together. "
"Frasier: What, you weren't enjoying our time together? "
"Woody: No, I... I had a great time that first night, but after that, I don't know, you were still having a good time, but ahhh, it was less and less fun for me. "
"Frasier: This is too funny. "
"Woody: See, you're still having a good time and I'm miserable. "
"Frasier: Why didn't you say something? "
"Woody: Well, I don't know, I didn't want to hurt your feelings. To tell you the truth, I felt kinda bad for ya. "
"Frasier: You felt bad for me? "
"Woody: Well no offense, but look at your life. You live with your dad, you hang out with your brother, you have no plans. And let's face it, those karaoke friends of yours, I wouldn't want to be stranded on a desert island with them. Well, maybe that English guy, he's a good entertainer. "
"Frasier: Really Woody, there's nothing to worry about. I know my life may seem rather dreary to you but ah, it's really quite enjoyable. In fact, it's even a lot of fun. I love my life now, honestly. You know what, I wouldn't trade my years at Cheers for anything, but I am very happy with my life the way it is today. "
"Woody: You mean it? "
"Frasier: Yes. That's what makes this conversation so ironic. You see, you see my life as some sort of middle-aged compromise and, well just the other day I was thinking about your life. And all I could think was... "
"Woody: What? "
"Frasier: How lucky you are. You see, you've found where you belong and you've made your home there. I guess for some of us it just takes longer than others. "
"Woody: I just stopped in for a beer... "
"Frasier: Well, you know what, Niles will be on the phone for a couple of more minutes, why don't we have one last drink together, huh? "
"Woody: That'd be nice. "
"Frasier: Okay. Barkeep, a couple of beers here, please? "
"Woody: You know, I meant what I said. I had a great time hanging out with you. That first night. "
"Frasier: Yeah. "
"Woody: Maybe we could do it again, in five or ten years. "
"Frasier: Absolutely. Ten years it is. "
"Woody: Cheers. "
"Frasier: Cheers. "

"Niles: Francois. It's Niles Crane. You delivered some champagne earlier for Valentine's Day? Well, you brought over the '88 and I asked for the '85. Yes, my date will know the difference, she happens to be the president of my wine club. Thank you, thank you. Yes, remember, I won't be at home. No, I'm not entertaining at the Shangri-La, my brother was kind enough to let me use his apartment. "
"Niles: Well, what could I do? I threw a blanket over it. All right. Now, hurry, please, this woman is very particular. [He hangs up and looks at Eddie.] Lucky for you she loves dogs. "
"to: the kitchen where Niles puts the solvent away under the sink "
"to: the living room. Niles stands around, obviously still smelling "
"TO: Roz's apartment as she puts on makeup. Her phone rings and she "
"Frasier: "
"Roz: Hello. "
"Frasier: Roz, it's Frasier. Look, I need your help. "
"Roz: Well, I don't have much time, I'm on my way out. "
"Frasier: OK, just answer me "
"this: How do you know if you're on a date? "
"Roz: Are you alone? "
"Frasier: Yes. "
"Roz: Then you're not on a date. "
"Frasier: Very funny. Listen, I'm at a restaurant, waiting for Cassandra Stone - you know, our new publicity director? She asked me out for dinner, and well, I was very flattered. I mean, I think she's a terrific woman. It's just I'm starting to wonder if this is a business dinner, or more of a romantic date. "
"Roz: Well, you're going out for dinner on Valentine's Day, sounds like a date to me. "
"Frasier: Yes, well, she didn't realize it was Valentine's Day until I reminded her. She did say she wanted to go over a new ad campaign. "
"Roz: Oh, come on, every time I see you two together, she's got her hands all over you. "
"Frasier: She's always got her hands all over everybody. She's a big flirt. "
"Roz: That's true. She even flirted with me the first time I met her 'til I took off my baseball cap and parka. Why don't you just ask her if it's a date? "
"Frasier: Oh, Roz, I can't do that, what if the answer is 'No'? For God's sake, it'll be awkward all through dinner. Awkward at work. Imagine how embarrassing it'll be if it gets around the station. "
"Roz: Well, I guess you're just gonna have to play it by ear. Well, you'll know what she has in mind by the way she dresses, how she acts, how she treats you... "
"Frasier: Yeah, yeah, I guess you're right. "
"Roz: Oh, there's my date. "
"Frasier: Oh, who are you going out with tonight? "
"Roz: Oh, Bob. You know, the tax accountant. "
"Frasier: Isn't he the one who drones on so incessantly you call him 'The Cricket'? "
"Roz: No, I call him 'The Cricket' because he rubs his hands together really fast during sex. Bye. "
"Frasier: Goodbye. "
"Frasier: Cassandra. "
"Cassandra: Sorry to keep you waiting. "
"Frasier: Oh, that's OK. I was just starting to wonder if you'd changed your mind. "
"Cassandra: What, and pass up dinner with the sexiest man in radio? "
"Frasier: Oh, well. It's just our plans were so last-minute, I thought maybe I misunderstood. "
"Frasier: My, things have certainly been clarified, haven't they? "
"Cassandra: Will you excuse me for a second? "
"Frasier: Of course. "
"Frasier: Excuse me. Excuse me. You see that woman over by the coat-check? "
"Violinist: Yes. "
"Frasier: She's my dinner companion for the evening and things have taken a turn towards the romantic. I want to make her feel as special as possible. [He gives the violinist some cash.] "
"Violinist: Then you should have offered to check her coat. "
"Frasier: Yes, thank you very much All right, just play something romantic when she gets back. "
"Mario: Miss Cassandra, so nice to see you again. "
"Cassandra: You too, Mario. And how's the sexiest Maitre d’ in Seattle? "
"Cassandra: Sorry again for keeping you waiting. I got sucked in at this cocktail party. "
"Frasier: Oh, you were at a cocktail party. "
"Cassandra: Some benefit thing. It was very fancy. Obviously, why else would I show up wearing this? "
"Frasier: Why else indeed. "
"Cassandra: Oh, they have the best wine list here. Do you feel like sharing a bottle? "
"Frasier: If you like. "
"Cassandra: Good thing I took a cab here, I'm a real lightweight. Then again, I'm sure a gentleman like you wouldn't mind escorting me back to my room after dinner, will you? "
"Frasier: Oh, I think that can be arranged. "
"Cassandra: I love the food here. "
"Frasier: What do you recommend? "
"Cassandra: I'll start with the anchovies and red peppers, and then the garlic chicken with scallions. "
"Cassandra: Are you in the mood for oysters? "
"Frasier: Actually, I'm not sure. "
"Frasier: Well, here we are. Your hotel room. Last stop. "
"Cassandra: Oh, thank you so much for this coat. "
"Frasier: Of course. "
"Cassandra: Oh, God, I can't believe we got caught in that rainstorm, I'm freezing "
"Frasier: Yeah, me too. "
"Cassandra: Oh, I know something we can do to warm up real fast. "
"Frasier: Yes, all we have to do is... "
"Cassandra: Have a brandy. "
"Frasier: Yes Let's have a brandy "
"Cassandra: The mini-bar's over there. I'll be right out. "
"Frasier: Uh-huh. "
"Roz: Hello. "
"Frasier: Roz. It's Frasier. "
"TO: Roz. She is in bed. The camera inter-cuts again. "
"Roz: Where are you? "
"Frasier: I'm in Cassandra's hotel room. She invited me up here after dinner. I'm just not sure what it means. "
"Roz: What it means? What it means is that even a blind pig finds an acorn once in a while. "
"Frasier: I'm still getting a lot of conflicting signals here. You see, maybe she just invited me up here to talk business. I just wish I could get one clear, unambiguous sign. "
"Cassandra: Oh, I just had to get out of that dress. "
"Frasier: Oh, here's your brandy. "
"Cassandra: I'll just go dry my hair. "
"Frasier: Roz, I'm back. "
"Roz: She ditched her dress and she's hitting the sauce. What do you need, runway lights on the mattress? "
"Frasier: Roz, Roz it's not as clearcut as it seems. "
"Roz: Look, Frasier, she is way out on a limb here. Do you know how rejected she's gonna feel if you don't make a move? You're gonna blow it forever. "
"Frasier: You're right. I'm going to take off my jacket. "
"Roz: Yeah. Go get 'em, cowboy. "
"Cassandra: Frasier? Are you making yourself comfortable? "
"Frasier: Yes. "
"Cassandra: If it's OK, I still have some questions about the ad campaign I'd like to ask you. "
"Frasier: Well, that's why I'm here. "
"Cassandra: Or if you prefer, we could just talk about it over breakfast tomorrow. "
"Frasier: Breakfast, you say? "
"Cassandra: I hope I wasn't being presumptuous. We will be having breakfast tomorrow, won't we? "
"Frasier: Absolutely. "
"Cassandra: Great So who else wil be there? "
"Frasier: Where? "
"Cassandra: At the breakfast meeting. The one for the sponsors here at the hotel, tomorrow. You just said you were going, right? "
"Frasier: The meeting. Of course. "
"Cassandra: Frasier, what are you doing? "
"Frasier: Well, I, uh... "
"Cassandra: I thought you said you were going to make yourself comfortable. Why don't you check the closet? I'm sure you can find somthing to slip into. I'm just going to take my lenses out. "
"Cassandra: You know, I'm really glad I asked you to dinner. "
"Frasier: Gosh, so am I. "
"Cassandra: You may not believe this, but I almost chickened out at the last minute. It just goes to show it's always better to take the risk. I mean, so you say 'No.' I'm an adult, what's a little embarrassment? "
"Frasier: I couldn't agree more. "
"Cassandra: Did you find the slippers? "
"Frasier: What? "
"Cassandra: In the closet. "
"Cassandra: You stepped in that puddle after dinner, I thought you might want to get out of those wet shoes and socks. It's up to you, I know some people feel funny about taking their shoes off in someone else's room. My gosh, it's really starting to come down out there. You know what I'm thinking? "
"Frasier: No. I truly don't. "
"Cassandra: Well, it doesn't make much sense for you to drive home in this weather, especially since you are coming back for breakfast anyway. Why don't you just stay over tonight? "
"Frasier: All right. When you say 'Stay over', you mean of course...? "
"Cassandra: Stay here. "
"Frasier: Oh, here. Right. Splendid. "
"Cassandra: Oh, my God "
"Frasier: What? I'm sorry, I'm sorry. "
"Cassandra: I just can't believe it's so late. What are you sorry for? "
"Frasier: Oh, just for... keeping you up so late. "
"Cassandra: Oh, that's all right. Aren't you coming to bed? "
"Frasier: Oh, yes. Coming to bed. Coming to... this bed. "
"Cassandra: Well, would you mind turning the lights out? "
"Frasier: Oh, no, no, not at all. "
"Frasier: You know, Cassandra, I know this may sound like a silly question seeing as how we're... in bed together and... nearly naked, and... I've just been "
"wondering: Is this a romantic date, or... a business thing? "
"Frasier: Roz, it's Frasier "
"Martin: You know, Daph, I'm really impressed with you. A lot of people get all insecure if they don't have a date on Valentine's Day, but not you. "
"Daphne: Oh, heaven's no. If you think about it, it's just a silly holiday they made up to sell more flowers and candy. "
"Martin: Right. Well, you take a look at the menu and I'll check your coat. "
"Daphne: Oh, no need for that. So, what looks good to you? "
"Martin: The coat-check girl. Gimme your coat. "
": Happy Valentine's Day, welcome to Russano's. "
"Daphne: Thank you. "
": The waiter will be by to take your drink order when your husband gets back. "
"Daphne: Oh, he's not my husband. I don't have a... husband. "
"Martin: Wow, I wish there was somethin' else I could check. Besides my blood pressure. Well, I know what I'm in the mood for, a nice big steak. How 'bout you? "
"Martin: What happened? "
"Daphne: Well, look around you. Nothing but couples in love. It's never gonna be me. I'm just going to end up a dried-up old maid in a quilted bathrobe with a smelly deaf cat on my lap "
"Martin: But I thought you said you were OK with that. "
"Daphne: What? "
"Martin: All right, Daph. Come on, now, come on, now, don't get upset, here, have a drink of water or somethin'. "
"Daphne: Oh, I'm sorry about this. "
"Martin: That's OK. "
"Daphne: I don't know what came over me. I haven't cried like that since, well... New Year's Eve. "
"Martin: Oh, geez, come on, Daph. You're, uh, you know, you're going to find someone. "
"Daphne: You think so? "
"Martin: Well, sure. Yeah, you're... you have a lot of very great qualities. "
"Daphne: Thank you. I'm so sorry about this. I know it makes you uncomfortable to talk about personal things. "
"Martin: Yeah, well, that's all right. So, you ready to order? "
"Daphne: Yeah. "
"Daphne: What kind of qualities? "
"Martin: Well... you know, you're smart, and nice-looking, and fun to be with. So you gonna go with the soup or salad? "
"Daphne: You really think I'm nice-looking? "
"Martin: Well, sure, yeah. Where's that guy with the bread? "
"Daphne: That is so sweet of you. "
"Martin: Well, don't mention it. Let's just have a nice happy evening. "
"Daphne: Of course. I'm fine now. Nice- looking how? "
"Martin: Oh, geez "
"Daphne: Oh, never mind. "
"Martin: Oh, no it's all right. Well, you know, you're pretty and, uh... tall, and uh... take good care of your hair, you know... You're attractive, what do you want from me? "
"Daphne: Well, I'm sorry, but I don't here this sort of thing very much lately. "
"Martin: Well, you're just in a slump, that's all. You ask me, you're a great catch. "
"Waiter: It's not my place to say so, Miss, but I think your father's right. You're a very attractive woman. "
"Daphne: Well, how about that? That's a nice little ego boost. "
"Martin: Yeah. "
"Daphne: I feel so silly all of a sudden. Getting upset out of nowhere like that. Well, I feel better now. Ready to share a nice big steak? "
"Martin: Yeah, fine, whatever. "
"Daphne: What's wrong with you? "
"Martin: Why did he assume I was your father? I mean, a lot of guys my age go out with women like you. What's he tryin' to say? That I could never attract someone young and pretty? "
"Daphne: Well, thank you, Mr. Crane. "
"Martin: Does this all have to be about you? "
"Daphne: Oh, for heaven's sakes. You're a very attractive man with lots of wonderful qualities. "
"Martin: Yeah, yeah, I know. All right, let's order. "
"Martin: Like what? "
"Daphne: Oh, come on now. You're very charming, and you have a good sense of humor. And you've got lovely eyes. [he laughs modestly] But most of all, you're good company. I enjoy living with you. "
"Martin: Well, thank you, Daphne. I like living with you, too. "
"Daphne: Thank you. "
"Daphne: So why do you like living with me? "
"Martin: Oh, for God's sake, can't we just agree to cut this out? "
"Daphne: Oh, all right, all right. You're wonderful, I'm wonderful. You know it's funny when I think about the two of us. I mean, sure, we have our little fights, but for the most part we get along so well together. And when I think about how I enjoy looking after you, and how you always seem to miss me when I've been gone for too long, well it's sort of like you're my... "
"Martin: What? "
"Daphne: No, it might sound funny to say this... "
"Martin: No, come on, that's all right, you can say it. "
"Daphne: All right. Well, it's sort of like you're my pet. "
"Martin: What? "
"Daphne: In a good sense. Like you and Eddie. "
"Martin: What the hell you talkin' about? You callin' me a dog now? "
"Daphne: It's an analogy, for God's sake... "

"Frasier: Thank you very much. "
"Frasier: Well, Roz — oh Baby pictures? "
"Roz: Actually, these aren't the most flattering. "
"Frasier: Oh, nonsense. Baby Alice couldn't possibly take a bad picture. Oh, well, that's just adorable, the silly little one with the jam all over her face. "
"Roz: Well, actually that's not jam, Frasier. It's baby eczema. "
"Frasier: Oh. Well, don't worry about that. That sort of thing is bound to clear up. Or spread. "
"Roz: Just give them back "
"Niles: Hello, all. "
"Frasier: Niles. "
"Niles: Ooh, baby pictures "
"Roz: Oh, I really don't want anyone to look at those "
"Niles: Well, I don't know why not. Botticelli himself couldn't have painted a more perfect angel. "
"Roz: Thank you, Niles She is precious, isn't she? "
"Frasier: Anyway, Niles, uh, how did things go with Maris's lawyers? "
"Niles: Maris is determined to prolong my suffering. She's asked to postpone our court date another eight months. "
"Frasier: Eight months? "
"Niles: Yes, last night I was in such a state I almost wished I had a piano to crawl under. "
"Roz: What? "
"Niles: Oh, uh, it's a habit I developed as a child to combat anxiety. There's something about the safe, dark, protective environment that seemed comforting to me. "
"Frasier: Yes, the week before his first Little League trial, he practically lived under there. "
"Roz: Well, we all did weird stuff when we were kids. "
"Frasier: So, Niles, uh, how did your lawyers respond to this postponement request? "
"Niles: Well, I can tell you they weren't very happy about it They got on the phone, raised some hell, and got that postponement cut down to... seven months. "
"Frasier: Niles, are you serious? Do you think maybe it's time that you consider getting some new lawyers? "
"Niles: Fire Harrison & Reed? They're the top firm in Seattle. "
"Frasier: But they're bleeding you dry Do you realize that they don't mind these postponements at all? You know the longer they draw this thing out, the more money they'll get paid. "
"Roz: Oh, you know, I have the perfect person for you to call. My old boyfriend, Donny, he's a great lawyer "
"Niles: No offense, Roz, but I highly doubt that your 'Donny' is in the same league with Harrison & Reed. "
"Roz: Don't be so sure. I mean, he's smart, he's tough, he doesn't take 'no' for an answer — not that I ever tested that theory. "
"Frasier: Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute, are we talking about Donny Douglas? "
"Roz: Yes "
"Frasier: Oh my God, Niles, I've read about this guy He's the one they call 'the Piranha,' right? "
"Roz: Yes, but that's partly because he has this night-grinding problem that makes his teeth really sharp and tiny. "
"Frasier: Yes, well, anyway, Niles, I mean this guy just won a huge case. He might be just who you need. "
"Niles: I appreciate your concern, but really my situation is not as dire as you're making it out to be. "
"Roz: What's that smell? "
"Niles: What smell? "
"Roz: The one coming out of your briefcase. "
"Niles: Oh, I don't smell anything— "
"Frasier: My God, is this your lunch? A baloney sandwich? And a fruit cocktail? Oh, Niles. You see what these lawyers have reduced you to? Do you have any idea what they're having for lunch? "
"Niles: I don't know. They don't itemize, they just bill me for the total. "
"Maria: Donny should be here any minute. Make yourselves comfortable. "
"Niles: Thank you. "
"Frasier: Thank you. "
"Niles: Frasier, you really don't have to stay. "
"Frasier: Well, I didn't have to come at all. But if I hadn't, you never would have. Well, the office seems nice enough. Might have overdone it on the plants a little. "
"Niles: Yes, it's excess like this that's destroying the plastic rainforest. "
"Frasier: Niles... "
"Niles: Oh, University of Las Vegas No problem finding tassels for those mortar boards. "
"Frasier: Will you stop being such a snob? Give this man a chance, for God's sake. And please, will you have a mint? I'm halfway across the room, all I can smell is baloney "
"Donny: Whoa Hey, how you doing? Donny Douglas. How are ya, who's who? "
"Frasier: Mr. Douglas, I'm Frasier Crane— "
"Donny: You're Frasier Crane— "
"Frasier: This is Niles Crane. "
"Donny: Oh, you're Niles Crane. Frasier Crane? You're Roz's buddy, aren't you? "
"Frasier: Yes, yes. "
"Donny: Oh, you got to do me a favor, O.K.? Tell Roz, finally I had my teeth capped. See? "
"Frasier: Oh yes, well, I'll tell her. "
"Donny: Promise you won't forget? "
"Frasier: Oh, not much danger of that. "
"Donny: OK. Now I got to be in court in about, uh, twenty minutes, so sit down, let's get started. "
"Niles: Well, as we discussed on the phone— "
"Donny: Maria, I need my gray suit for court Come on, come on, come on "
"Niles: Well, Maris is determined to exhaust my already-strained financial resources, and the real injustice— "
"Donny: Yeah, and Maria, could you just cancel that four o'clock of mine? And can you also put Joe Silva on my call sheet? I'm listening, I'm listening, come on, come on, come on "
"Niles: Yeah, well, Maris has no right to be angry with me— "
"Donny: Maria You're the best, thank you so much, cool. What, what? Come on, come on, let's go What? "
"Niles: Uh... I'm sorry, I forgot what I was saying. "
"Donny: Oh, don't worry, Maria has that effect on men all the time. ' wave. "
"Frasier: Niles, I think you were about to tell Mr. Douglas about Dr. Schenkman. "
"Niles: Right. Well, uh, last year Maris and I were actually making progress in couples' therapy, when to my dismay I discovered that she and our therapist were— "
"Donny: Oh, my God. "
"Niles: That's right, they were— "
"Donny: This is the best corned beef I have ever tasted. You've got to have a bite of this. Here. Come on, it's got spicy mustard "
"Niles: No, thanks. "
"Donny: How about you? "
"Frasier: Sorry, mustard allergy. "
"Niles: Mr. Douglas, maybe we'll come back when you have more time. "
"Donny: No, no, uh-uh I got the gist. Your wife was doing your shrink, and now she's trying to bleed you with a long pre- trial. I get it. Who's her lawyer? "
"Niles: Lockhart & Whalen. "
"Donny: Maria, get me Lockhart Or Whalen. "
"Niles: Wait, wait, wait, you're calling them? "
"Donny: Yeah. Listen, could we just cut through the formalities here? "
"Niles: Uh, OK. "
"Donny: Niles, what you need is a guy like me representing you. What you're in here is a street fight, and you got to know who's covering your back. So, what I guarantee you is "
"this: "
"Donny: You will never see me unprepared, you will never see me intimidated, and you will never, ever see me throw in the towel You understand? "
"Frasier: Let's certainly hope not. "
"Maria: I've got Geoff Whalen on Line One "
"Donny: OK, thank you "
"Niles: May I have a word with you? "
"Frasier: Yes. "
"Donny: Whalen Donny Douglas here, I'm calling about Niles Crane. Yeah... "
"Niles: I can't possibly let this man represent me. I'll be humiliated "
"Frasier: Niles, you have got to hear this man out. I'm sorry, this is exactly what you want in a lawyer, someone who's not afraid to show a little moxie "
"Niles: Oh, he's an inch away from showing us the Full Moxie "
"room: "
"Donny: ...facing a counter-suit for deliberate infliction of pain and emotional distress. What, you don't think I can win? You call York & McFaddon. You see what those bastards had to pay for trying to pull this same crap on a client of mine "
"Donny: Yeah, we're talking big numbers here, Whalen You haven't seen so many zeroes lined up since Mr. Spock had a book signing You got to hear this, come here, come here "
"Whalen: Well, yes, of course it's important to be reasonable. "
"Whalen: Um, I'm sure we can move a few things around and be ready for court by... next month? "
"Whalen: Mr. Douglas? "
"Donny: Yeah? "
"Whalen: Does this mean you're now representing Niles Crane? "
"Donny: That's exactly what that means. And Whalen, I'll be in touch about a discovery schedule. Have a nice day ' gesture. "
"Niles: Mr. Douglas, that was brilliant. "
"Frasier: Yes. My goodness, almost makes me wish I was still married to Lilith "
"Donny: Now they're probably going to get rolling sometime this week with depositions. So, you know, pick a day, we'll get together, I will prepare you But it's going to be very low-key, very casual, you know, over dinner, something like that. "
"Maria: You're due in court in ten minutes. "
"Donny: O.K. "
"Maria: And Donny? "
"Donny: Yeah? "
"Maria: Mustard. "
"Donny: Oh, oh, jeez, was that there the whole time? [Frasier and Niles shrug] That's so embarrassing "
"TO: "
"Frasier: And indeed, I had high hopes for Niles and Maris, as is witnessed by my wedding toast, in which I combined my heartfelt sentiments with apt quotations from Shakespeare, jazz great Louis Armstrong, and the poet Catullus. "
"Donny: And so your answer would be, 'Yes, I attended their wedding.' Once again, Frasier, could you try to keep your answers brief? "
"Frasier: Well, I— "
"Martin: Trust me, he did. "
"Frasier: All right, all right. Look, I'll try to do better. "
"Martin: I still don't understand why they're deposing Frasier before Niles. "
"Donny: Oh, they like to question friends and family first so they can get as much 'information' as they can to try and catch Niles out in a lie. Now, look, they're also going to allege that during the separation, Niles was wasteful with money. "
"Niles: Wha...? She's calling ME wasteful? "
"Donny: Mmm-hmm. "
"Niles: Do you recall what she used to do when one of our dogs needed a shampoo? "
"Frasier: Yes, she'd fill the bathtub with Evian "
"Niles: Half the time she'd just get a new dog "
"Donny: Anyway, look, Frasier, they might ask you if you witnessed any examples of Niles throwing money around, and your answer would be... "
"Frasier: Yes. "
"Donny: No, no, no The answer is, 'not to the best of my recollection' "
"Frasier: But I do recall And I'll be under oath "
"Donny: Oh, please, not this again. "
"Niles: As you've probably figured out, Frasier is a bit of a stickler when it comes to his ethics, and frankly I applaud him for it. "
"Donny: Oh, great. "
"Daphne: More coffee, anyone? "
"Donny: No, thank you, Daphne. I think I'm just about done here. In fact, I've got a conference call back at the office. I'm just going to check to see if that's still happening. Frasier, why don't you see if there's any more questions in there we haven't done yet, all right? "
"Frasier: All right, uh... We've done those... Oh, here's one. 'Can you recall a specific incident when Maris lost her temper or behaved in a way you'd characterize as volatile or unstable?' "
"Donny: You're kidding No, really, well, based on what? Oh, please. "
"Niles: Something wrong? "
"Donny: No, it's OK. Yeah, no, thank you, thank you, Maria, no. Maris's lawyers, they kill me. I mean, all week long it's been one desperate ploy after another. This one, this is the best one yet "
"Frasier: Well, what is it? "
"Donny: Oh, now they're claiming 'alienation of affection.' "
"Martin: You're kidding me After what she did? "
"Donny: Yeah, believe it or not, now they're saying that during the marriage, Niles was in love with another woman. "
"Daphne: Who? "
"Donny: Oh, you. "
"Daphne: Me? "
"Niles: Dear God "
"Daphne: That's absurd Have you ever heard anything so ridiculous? "
"Frasier: Well... not to the best of my recollection. "
"Resume: "
"Daphne: Why on earth would they think Dr. Crane's in love with me? "
"Donny: Oh, something about a country club ball the two of you attended a few years back. "
"Niles: This is all based on that? "
"Donny: Yeah. You caused quite a stir on the dance floor, or something? "
"Daphne: Yeah, we were just putting on a show for his snobby friends. "
"Donny: You must have been very convincing, because they're going to subpoena you for deposition. Now, look, you know, we can just call their bluff right away. You can come tomorrow morning with Frasier. "
"Daphne: Fine by me. "
"Donny: OK, great. Now listen, Daphne, I'm gonna have to prepare you for this, 'cause lawyers, they can twist your words around. They get a judge to buy it, because of the pre-nup, Maris can really stick it to Niles. But I've got this conference call at the office— "
"Daphne: I could come with you. "
"Donny: Oh, great We'll get it done in about an hour. "
"Daphne: Just let me grab my coat. Don't you worry, Dr. Crane "
"Donny: Now, Frasier, I hope you realize they are going to ask you about this business too. "
"Frasier: Me? "
"Donny: Yes, but don't worry. This is one time when your compulsive truth-telling won't get us into any trouble. Bye. "
"Martin: Bye. "
"Niles: Well, that's it. It's over. It's over and I've lost. Maris has won. Maris always wins. "
"Martin: Niles— "
"Niles: Niles never wins Niles always loses That's why Niles lives at the 'Shangri-La' and drives a hatchback "
"Martin: Niles, now get a grip Maris's people are just fishing. We're the only one's who know how you feel about Daphne. "
"Niles: Today Tomorrow, everyone will know, including Daphne. And this is how she's going to find out. I wanted to whisper it to her over a candlelight dinner, not have it read back to her by a court stenographer "
"Martin: What are you talking about? Frasier's not going to tell "
"Niles: He's gonna be under oath What if they ask him point blank? "
"Martin: Well, he'll just say no. Right, Fras? "
"Martin: Fras? "
"Frasier: Well, it's not that simple You heard what he said, I'll be under oath. "
"Niles: Oh my God. I can't breathe. I can't breathe "
"Frasier: Niles, here Put your head between your legs I'll get you some water "
"Martin: Niles, you'll be all right. Just take a couple of deep breaths. "
"Niles: If I could take deep breaths it would mean I could breathe "
"Martin: You're really not going to go down there tomorrow and blow it for him, are you? "
"Frasier: Dad, there is nothing more I'd like to do than to help my brother. But I would like to find a way to do it without violating my ethics "
"Martin: But Maris is responsible for this divorce Niles's feelings for Daphne has nothing to do with it Now, if you cover for Niles you won't be doing anything wrong. "
"Frasier: Dad, we are talking about perjury When is that ever acceptable? "
"Martin: Oh, you want an example? Fine Let's say, uh, what if there was a comet hurtling towards the earth— "
"Frasier: Oh, for God's sake "
"Martin: And you were the only person who could save the earth, but the only way to do it is by lying under oath. Would you do it then? "
"Frasier: Who am I lying to, the comet? "
"Martin: Oh, just answer the question "
"Frasier: All right, I suppose in certain extreme cases— "
"Martin: So, then you'd lie? "
"Frasier: To save mankind from a talking comet, yes "
"Martin: But you won't lie for Niles. "
"Frasier: Oh, for God's sake, you make me sound like some sort of insensitive lout who's not aware that his brother's out there in pain "
"Martin: Isn't that Niles's water? "
"Frasier: I'm just checking to see it's not too cold "
"Frasier: Niles? Niles? "
"Niles: I'm over here. "
"Frasier: The piano, Niles Please, please, just come out from under there. Things are not that bad. "
"Niles: Not that bad? Daphne is going to find out about this "
"Martin: Not if you crawl out before she gets home. "
"Frasier: Niles, please, come out here. Now, come on. "
"Niles: Why should I? There's nothing for me out there. It's all lawyers and ex-wives and broken hearts. All I have to contend with under here is a couple of dust bunnies... some cobwebs... some kind of a nest. Dear God, doesn't your vacuum come with any attachments? "
"Martin: Oh, all right. Just sit tight and I'll get you a wet cloth. Well, look what you've done, I hope you're happy now "
"Frasier: Well, do you really want to see me lying under oath? "
"Martin: Well, it's better than seeing your brother lying under a piano "
"Frasier: You know, I can't believe you're being so casual about this Do you realize you're asking me to do something completely unethical? "
"Martin: Oh, for God's sake, nobody's even going to know "
"Frasier: Yes, but that's the point Ethics are what we do when no one else is looking For heaven's sake, I learned that from you Are you saying you wouldn't have any trouble with this? "
"Martin: Niles? Here. "
"Niles: Thank you. "
"Martin: Let me tell you something. One time when I was on the force, I saw a guy shoot somebody. When we caught him, I started to read him his rights, but he slipped out of his cuffs and he swung at me so I didn't get a chance to finish. Two months later, I'm on the stand, and his lawyer asks me if I'd read his rights in full. Now, if I say no this guy walks, and this guy has been in and out of jail all his life, he could have read ME his rights So I say, 'yes, I did. I read them in full.' I lied under oath. Now you might think that I did an unethical thing but there's not a doubt in my mind that I did the right thing. "
"Frasier: Well, Dad, I'm still not sure what I'm going to do. "
"Martin: Why do you have to make everything so complicated? "
"Frasier: I don't know I just know that I'm never going to figure out anything with you barking in my ear "
"Martin: Well, where are you going? "
"Frasier: To get some air "
"Martin: Oh, yeah, yeah, run away, just like you always do Boy, I sometimes don't understand your brother. I guess some of us can deal with a tough situation head on, and others just need an escape. "
"Maria: Dr. Crane? They'll be ready for you in just a few minutes. "
"Frasier: Thank you. "
"Niles: Frasier. Have you, uh—? "
"Frasier: Niles — no, not yet. Daphne's still in the conference room. The place is slithering with Maris's lawyers. "
"Niles: Never a mongoose around when you need one. Listen, Frasier, I'm sorry I ever put you in this position. "
"Frasier: Niles, it's not your fault. "
"Niles: Now listen, I thought a lot about this last night, and I realize the way I was carrying on yesterday was just making it harder for you to do whatever you feel is the right thing. "
"Frasier: Well, honestly I'm still not really sure what the right thing is. "
"Niles: Well, if it makes any difference, I've decided to tell Donny everything about Daphne. "
"Frasier: Really? "
"Niles: Yes, then he can proceed however he sees fit. "
"Frasier: But, why, Niles? "
"Niles: Well, I started to wonder, maybe my feelings for Daphne did affect my marriage. Maybe on some intuitive level Maris knew all along. I can't be certain that that's not what drove her to Schenkman. "
"Frasier: Listen to "
"me: the only reason that marriage lasted as long as it did was because of the effort that YOU put into it. From the moment that you slipped that ring onto her bony little finger and it slipped right off again There is no way that this divorce is your fault. "
"Niles: I wish I could be sure of that. "
"Donny: OK, Frasier — oh, Niles OK, good. Frasier, they're just about ready for you. Wait for me outside the conference room, will you? And DON'T go in without me. I want a word alone with your brother here. "
"Frasier: Right. Uh, I wish there was something I could do, Niles. "
"Niles: Well, there is. When you go home this afternoon, leave a bottle of sherry under the piano. "
"Donny: WAIT for me. Right, Niles, I'm really glad you're here, there's something I really want to talk to you about. "
"Niles: Yes, I need to talk to you too— "
"Donny: No, me first. Now, the only way this relationship is going to work, Niles, is if we're completely honest with each other. "
"Niles: I agree. "
"Donny: Well, I've been doing a little digging. I've been finding out you've been holding out on me. "
"Niles: And I'm very sorry about that— "
"Donny: Well, why didn't you tell me that's where Maris's money came from? "
"Niles: It's never easy... Maris's money? "
"Donny: Yeah, I mean you told me that Maris's family money came from 'timber?' "
"Niles: It did. It did come from timber. "
"Donny: Oh, that's what you really think. "
"Niles: Well, of course. It's true. "
"Donny: And that's what all of Maris's friends think too? All those country club snobs who would kill for a good piece of dirt on someone? "
"Niles: Well, what are you talking about? If her family money didn't come from timber, where did it come from? "
"Niles: Urinal cakes? ' gesture. "
"Niles: I don't believe this All these years, the doyenne of Seattle's elite looking down her nose at everyone in sight, she owes it all to this. She's managed to have her urinal cake and eat it too "
"Donny: Yes, I think we now have what's known in the legal profession as a bargaining chip "
"Niles: Oh, are you kidding? She'd give anything to keep this quiet "
"Donny: All right, let me go talk to Maris's lawyers. "
"Niles: No, no, no There's some news you'd like to deliver yourself. May I? "
"Donny: Absolutely. "
"Niles: Hello, Marta, I'd like to speak to Maris. Oh, why not? Ah. She's in the final level of her guru serenity training, the week-long vow of "
"silence: day six [Donny rolls his eyes; into phone] No, no, Marta, that's all right. She doesn't have to come to the phone. Just give her this "
"message: I've flushed out her family secret. [Donny punches the air; Maris rushes to the phone] Helloooooo, Maris "
"TO: "
"Niles: I can't remember the last time I felt this way The air is sweeter and colors are brighter It's as if my very senses have come alive "
"Frasier: It makes perfect sense, Niles. You've just won your life back. "
"Niles: Oh, wait, Frasier, watch this Excuse me? Today's special blend... Jamaican Blue Mountain. "
"Waiter: Yes, it is. "
"Frasier: Niles, that's very good, that's my favorite Well done. "
"Niles: Beans were gathered on the shady side of the northern slope... "
"Frasier: Don't push it. "
"Niles: I still can't believe this is all over. And I never dreamed I'd get a settlement like that I'll be able to get my whole life back — my apartment, my car And I owe it all to one amazing man. "
"Frasier: Well, thank you, Niles, but I can't take all the credit. I know, you're thinking of Donny. "
"Niles: Well, don't think I'm not grateful for all you did. "
"Frasier: You know, actually, to tell the truth, if it hadn't been for me badgering you to change your lawyers, Donny Douglas never would have come into your life. "
"Frasier: Of course, we mustn't forget Roz's part in all of this. "
"Niles: Waiter Who understands why anything happens? I mean, it's remarkable how completely one's life can change in an instant— "
"Frasier: Oh, Niles... "
"Niles: Hi, you two. "
"Daphne: "
"Donny: Oh, hello/Hi. "
"Daphne: Congratulations, Dr. Crane. I'm so happy for you. "
"Niles: Thank you, Daphne. "
"Frasier: Well, what are you two doing here together? "
"Donny: Oh well, you know, we talked— "
"Daphne: Oh well, after we worked on the deposition— "
"Donny: We got a little hungry— "
"Daphne: He took me out to dinner— "
"Donny: Too much wine— "
"Daphne: And we talked— "
"Donny: And we laughed a little— "
"Daphne: Look at us, we sound like an old married couple "
"Donny: I know. You know, Frasier, if you hadn't brought Niles to the office, then, ah, none of this would have happened. I guess I owe you one. "
"Frasier: Well, we mustn't forget Roz's part in all this "
"Donny: That scent is wonderful. What is it? "
"Niles: [to himself; wonderfully acted by DHP, simple in a sad sort of way] Cherry bark and almonds. "

"Martin: Oh, hey How was your afternoon? "
"Daphne: Do you know what this wonderful man did? "
"Donny: Oh Daphne, please don't... "
"Daphne: He filled a basket full of my favorite English "
"foods: blood pudding, jellied eels, kidney pie. And then he hid it in the shrub so we'd stumble upon it during our stroll through the park. "
"Donny: I was only a little afraid that somebody would find it before we got there, but fortunately - untouched. "
"Frasier: Yes, well just because it was untouched doesn't mean someone didn't find it. "
"Daphne: Hello, Dr. Crane. "
"Niles: Donny. "
"Donny: Hey, Tiger. Look what I've got for you. Think fast. "
"Niles: What are the keys to? "
"Donny: Your ex-wife's lakefront cottage, now YOUR lakefront cottage. A little something I hammered out for you in the settlement. "
"Niles: Thank you, Donny I never thought I'd see 'Shady Glen' again. "
"Frasier: Well, congratulations, Niles. "
"Martin: Yeah, looks like Donny really did a job on Maris's legal team "
"Niles: Yes, well he certainly is ruthless all right. [in Daphne's earshot] As a divorce lawyer, what a callous attitude he must have towards human relationships. "
"Daphne: Yeah, you'd think so, Dr. Crane, but actually he's just the opposite. I've never met anyone so incredibly romantic. "
"Niles: Yes, well I'm sure he seems that way on the OUTSIDE... "
"Frasier: Niles Please, stop what you're doing. It's unseemly enough when she's actually in the room "
"Niles: Oh, I'm sorry, what am I supposed to do? For the first time since I've known her I'm free and single and now she's with someone. Am I supposed to just suffer in silence? "
"Martin: I'd take that "
"Niles: I just don't understand, what does she see in him? If you were Daphne, would you go out with Donny? "
"Frasier: Well no, but I wouldn't massage Dad's ass for what I pay her either "
"Frasier: Look, I'm sorry, Niles, it's just that Donny and Daphne seem very happy together. Now either it's true love, in which case it's too late for you to declare yourself, or it's just a temporary infatuation- "
"Niles: It's got to be It's got to be "
"Frasier: ...In which case it will pass, and then you can make your move And in the mean time I suggest that maybe you start looking elsewhere. You know, maybe make a fresh start, do something to get your mind off of Daphne. "
"Niles: I know, I know, it's just difficult. "
"Frasier: Yes, I understand that... say, you know what, I've got an idea. Why don't the three of us go up to that new cabin of yours for the weekend? "
"Martin: Oh sorry, I can't. I've got a dentist appointment Saturday morning. "
"Frasier: Well, that's all right, Dad. Niles can go up on Friday night, put things together, and then you and I can drive up on Saturday afternoon. "
"Niles: Why not? It's a fabulous place, Dad. It's got a stereo and a big screen TV, and a sauna, wine cellar... "
"Frasier: Perfect for three guys roughing it in the wilderness "
"Martin: Well, I'm game. "
"Frasier: You know what? I can stop at the butcher, I'll pick up a couple of ducks and make my justly celebrated duck a l'orange. "
"Niles: Washed down with a winsome yet robust Chambertin? "
"Frasier: Chambertin "
"Martin: Yeah, and I'll bring a quart of whiskey in case of snakebite. "
"Niles: Dad, Dad, there are no snakes up there. "
"Martin: All right, I'll bring a snake [leaves to his room] "
"Frasier: God, this is great, Niles You know what, I've got to dash down to the mailbox to drop that letter in before the last pickup. Niles, trust me, you'll be glad you took my advice on this one. "
"Niles: I already am, thank you, Frasier. It's going to do me a world of good to get away from Daphne for a while. "
"Frasier: Yes, I couldn't agree more. "
"Niles: Hey Daphne, how'd you like to see my new lakefront cottage? "
"Daphne: Sounds lovely, when? "
"Niles: This weekend. We're all going. You can drive up with me on Friday, and Dad and Frasier will be... right behind. "
"Daphne: Well, that's very sweet, Dr. Crane, but I can't. One of my cousins is going to San Francisco this weekend and I promised I'd fly down. "
"Niles: That's a shame. "
"Daphne: Yeah, Donny's not too thrilled about it either. He wanted to come with me. "
"Niles: And he's not? "
"Daphne: No. That would have meant staying in a hotel together, and I'm not sure we're ready for that yet. I suppose you think I'm being a bit old-fashioned. "
"Niles: Dear God in heaven, no "
"Daphne: You can't force these things, you have to wait for the moment when you know it's right. "
"Niles: Yes, and sometimes the moment never comes and you just have to move on. "
"Daphne: But I really appreciate the invitation and I'll hope you'll invite me again. "
"Niles: All right. Daphne, how'd you like to see my new lakefront cottage? "
"Daphne: Silly "
"Roz: Martin, Niles Boy, this place is jammed. "
"Martin: Oh hey, Roz. You can have my seat, I'm on my way to Duke's. Yeah so, how's the world treating you? "
"Roz: Like dirt My social life is nonexistent. Every time I meet a guy who's halfway decent all I have to do is mention I've got a kid and he runs like a cheap pair of pantyhose. "
"Martin: Oh-ho... well, maybe you and Niles can cheer each other up. "
"Niles: Dad... "
"Roz: Why, what's his problem? "
"Martin: Oh, Daphne's got a new boyfriend and it's eating him up. "
"Niles: Dad "
"Roz: What? You've got a thing for Daphne? "
"Martin: What, you didn't know that after all these years? "
"Roz: No I can't believe Daphne never told me. "
"Martin: Well, how could she? She doesn't know either. "
"Roz: You're kidding "
"Niles: Yes, yes, he's a great kidder. Now, you Dad, run along, and you be very careful crossing streets "
"Martin: Six years, can you believe it? Some people just don't even know when it's time to pull the plug. "
"Niles: Well, I won't make that mistake twice "
"Roz: So let me get this straight... "
"Niles: Oh... "
"Roz: You've been hot for Daphne all this time and you never made a move? "
"Niles: I was a happily married man. "
"Roz: You were never happy and you've been separated for almost two years "
"Niles: Well... somehow the right moment never came along. "
"Roz: Oh, come on. I-I'm not trying to make you feel bad, it's just... waiting all this time and now she's got a boyfriend? "
"Niles: Obviously you've never let someone you've grown to care deeply about get away. "
"Roz: Well, sure I have. "
"Niles: I'm not talking about when the migrant workers leave at the end of the picking season. "
"Roz: No really, I've had a couple of boyfriends I shouldn't have let get away. "
"Niles: Serious relationships? "
"Roz: Yeah. In fact, I can name one right off the top of my "
"head: that lawyer I gave you, Donny? "
"Niles: Really? "
"Roz: Yeah. I mean, you only know him professionally, but he's very funny, warm, thoughtful. We were together for about six months, but he really wanted a family and I wasn't ready, so I dumped him. Now I have a family but no Donny. Gee, I wonder who he's seeing these days? "
"Roz: What's so funny? "
"Niles: I'll tell you in a minute. I just want to savor it, you've been having all the fun "
"Roz: So tell me "
"Niles: Donny's Daphne's boyfriend. "
"Roz: That's not funny When did this happen? "
"Niles: Well, she met him when he was working on my case. "
"Roz: Wow, and I was calling you a loser. "
"Niles: You never called me a loser. "
"Roz: In my head I did "
"Niles: Well, at the moment I have to agree with you. I've had plenty of opportunities and I've always chickened out. "
"Roz: Oh, don't blame yourself. She's living with your brother, working for your dad - it's an awkward situation. "
"Niles: It is Well... don't feel bad about Donny. It wasn't right for you at the time, that's nobody's fault. "
"Roz: Thanks, Niles. Hey listen, the next time you find somebody you like, don't wait so long to tell her. [looks at watch and gets up] Oh, I've got a babysitter waiting. Mrs. Hines is seventy years old and has a mole like Abe Lincoln but I bet SHE has plans for the weekend "
"Niles: You know what, I just had the craziest idea. My settlement with Maris includes a beautiful lakefront cottage and I'm going up there this afternoon. Why don't you come along? You can bring Alice. "
"Roz: Are you serious? "
"Niles: Well, Frasier and Dad are coming up tomorrow, but tonight it'd just be "
"us: Love's losers licking our wounds, laughing at our pain. "
"Roz: Gee, I don't know.. "
"Niles: Well, Frasier's making duck a L'orange and I'm bringing the wine. What about it? "
"Roz: Well, I never thought I'd say this, "
"but: you're on. "
"Niles: Oh, in a funny way this reminds me of that wonderful moment in 'A Streetcar Named Desire' when the brutish Stanley says to the ultra-refined Blanche, 'We've had this date with each other from the beginning.' "
"Roz: Well, I don't know the play all that well, but I can tell you right now I'm not all that refined. "
"Niles: No, actually I was picturing you more as Stanley. "
"Time: 8"
":00) "
"Donny: Hi, there. "
"Niles: Donny I'm so glad you could make it. "
"Donny: Well, thanks for inviting me. Wow, this is a great place to get some work done, with no distractions in sight. Thank- "
"Niles: Donny, I'd like to introduce... Oh, that's right, you two know each other, don't you? "
"Donny: Roz How the hell are you? Hi "
"Roz: "
"Donny: I didn't know you were going to be here. Well, this is going to be fun. Now, Niles, I've got to put these things somewhere... "
"Roz: I didn't know you'd be here. "
"Niles: Oh yeah, just in one of the bedrooms upstairs. [Donny heads up] Oh, but be careful not to wake Roz's baby. She's in that first room. "
"Donny: Roz, you've got a baby? Congratulations That means that you're... "
"Niles: Married? No, she's free as a bird "
"Donny: Well, I'll try to be quiet. "
"Roz: What the hell is this? "
"Niles: What do you mean? I just thought you two might enjoy reminiscing about all the good times you've shared... "
"Roz: Oh, no you don't Donny is seeing Daphne and I am not the kind who steals other people's boyfriends Not friends' boyfriends... not good friends'... Not again "
"Niles: Roz, you might recall you went out with him for six months. She's only seen him three or four times, they're not even sleeping together. "
"Roz: What? How would you know? "
"Niles: She told me. I don't want to be the bad guy here, but you did have him first and he did want to make a life with you. "
"Roz: Listen, there is no way that I am going... She hasn't slept with him? "
"Niles: She's English. "
"Roz: Why don't you just admit it? You're just doing this because you want Daphne. "
"Niles: Yes Yes Yes, I want Daphne - I think we belong together, just like I think you and Donny belong together, and why should two people be happy when four people can be ecstatic? "
"Roz: Well, you got a point there No No, no, no, it's just not right "
"Donny: Roz, I swear I did not wake her, she was already up when I went in to look at her. She's got such a sweet little face. "
"Roz: Her name is Alice. "
"Donny: Hi Alice, I'm Donny. "
"Roz: She doesn't usually let strangers hold her. "
"Donny: Oh, I've always been pretty good with kids. Come on, sweetie, come on. "
"Roz: How's my hair? "
"Frasier: Niles "
"Niles: Aah Frasier? Dad? What are you doing here today? "
"Martin: Oh, my dentist is sick, we had to reschedule. "
"Niles: Oh, no "
"Martin: Oh, it's just a head cold. "
"Frasier: Oh God, you haven't even heard the worst yet, "
"Niles: the butcher shop was closed, so here I am with all my spices, everything I need to make my duck a l'orange - all I've got's the l'orange "
"Martin: Well, looks like we're going to have get our ducks the old- fashioned way But we better get a move on, there's only a couple hours of daylight left. "
"Niles: Yes, you know, I saw some boxs of ammo in the mud room, Dad, through the kitchen. "
"Frasier: Are you insane? I'm not going to shoot any ducks, it's barbaric "
"Martin: Oh, I get it You'll eat them but you won't kill them. What do you think, these things are born 'a l'orange?' "
"Niles: Dad does have a point. You know, there is a duck blind right across the lake, and it would be such a good opportunity for you two to bond. "
"Frasier: Niles, what about you? "
"Niles: Well, I will stay here and season the pans. "
"Frasier: Well, I'm not going hunting "
"Niles: Well then you'll just have to drive back to Seattle, find another shop that's open, and come back tomorrow as scheduled "
"Frasier: What the hell is going on? Are you trying to get rid of us? "
"Niles: Oh, that's preposterous, why should I be trying to... "
"Roz: Frasier Martin You weren't supposed to be here until tomorrow. "
"Martin: Roz, what are you doing here? "
"Roz: Niles brought me. I'm just going to go heat up a bottle for Alice. "
"Frasier: Roz? "
"Niles: Roz? Roz. Yes, so why don't you two run along and leave me alone with... Roz. "
"Frasier: Roz? "
"Niles: Well, didn't you urge me to make a fresh start? "
"Frasier: True, but I gotta tell you Niles, Roz isn't the freshest start you could make "
"Martin: Now butt out, Frasier, if these two want to be alone together for a while, that's fine. Now we're going to go hunting, now come on. "
"Frasier: I'm not going hunting, Dad Roz and Niles? Please You guys have nothing in common "
"Niles: Frasier, we're not getting married. We're going to spend an afternoon together and-and see what comes from it, and... there's nothing wrong with trying something different "
"Martin: Which is exactly what you're going to do right now So come on, let's go get some ducks. "
"Frasier: Dad... "
"Niles: And please, take as long as you need. "
"Frasier: I don't want to go hunting "
"Martin: Now, come on Didn't you ever hear the expression, 'Two's company, Three's a crowd'? "
"Frasier: No Dad, I don't think I ever did, how does it go? "
"him: "
"Donny: I left some papers in the car. "
"Niles: Oh, where'd you park? "
"Donny: Out back "
"Niles: Ah, then it's best to go through the kitchen because we have a loose plank on the porch. "
"Donny: I already came in that way. "
"Niles: Yeah, well you cheated death once, don't push your luck "
"Frasier: Niles, one last warning. Take it from someone who knows you "
"both: you and Roz are not a good couple. "
"Niles: I understand you're saying that, but believe me, I have seen a new Roz today and underneath that brazen exterior she is a sweet, sensitive, shy, and vulnerable woman. "
"Roz: Niles, have you seen my nipples? "
"Niles: Uh, no. "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Niles and Roz? It's just ridiculous "
"Martin: Oh, not this again "
"Frasier: Well, they are just completely incompatible. "
"Martin: Well, haven't you ever heard about 'opposites attracting'? I mean, look at your mother and me. We went together for six months, nobody thought it would last, we had forty happy years together "
"Frasier: Never thought of it that way. "
"Martin: Yeah. And then, there are those relationships where people have a ton of things in common and of course they always work out real well "
"Frasier: Thank you, Dad, I suppose that was a backhanded comment about me and Lilith. "
"Martin: Wouldn't it be great if she was flying by here on her broomstick right now? Come on, sight up. "
"Frasier: No, no, Dad, I told you I'm not shooting anything. "
"Martin: Alright, blow the duck call. "
"Frasier: Well, all right. Gee, you know, I keep thinking about you and Mom; maybe Niles and Roz do have a chance. "
"Martin: Sure they do. Blow it again. "
"Frasier: Gosh, you know, I hope I didn't discourage Niles too much by the way I reacted. You know how much stock he puts in my opinion. "
"Martin: Blow it, Frasier. "
"Frasier: "
"Martin: I didn't mean the duck call "
"Donny: What about that time in Cancun when the car breaks down and that guy gives us a ride on- "
"Roz: A donkey "
"Donny: Oh God, I didn't realize it had gotten so late. I have to fax these contracts to the office right away. You wouldn't happen to have a machine, would you? "
"Niles: Well, there's one in the study, it's right down that hall. But can't that wait? We're all getting so mellow here. "
"Donny: You're right, it can wait. You know what we need? Another bottle of wine, I brought one, I'll get it. "
"Niles: Excellent, excellent. "
"Niles: Well, it's going well, don't you think? "
"Roz: Yeah, except your dad and Frasier will be here any minute, and if either one of them sees Donny, things are over. "
"Niles: They're not going to see Donny, because you're going to invite him to watch the sunset down by the lake, you're going to continue to work his charms on him, and then you're going to invite him out to dinner, and who knows where that'll lead? Well, what am I saying, we both know where that'll lead "
"Roz: You really think it'll work? "
"Niles: Yes, yes, yes. "
"conversation: "
"Niles: Now you go down there and you enjoy that romantic sunset. I'll stay here with the baby. "
"Frasier: Oh, for heaven's sake You're not going to let her go down and enjoy the sunset by herself "
"Niles: Frasier, what are you doing back so soon? "
"Frasier: I came back for some more ammo. Who knew ducks were so shifty? Listen, I know that you took my advice to heart, but I tell you I've changed my "
"mind: I now approve of you and Roz. "
"Niles: What? "
"Frasier: Yes, yes, the two of you should go for it. OK, come on, off you two go, let's go. "
"Niles: I don't think this is a good idea. "
"Frasier: Why not? "
"Roz: Yeah, I've changed my mind too, I'd rather stay here. "
"Frasier: What? You know what, you guys are putting far too much stock in my opinion. Come on, let's get down to the lake and enoy that sunset. "
"Niles: But-but- "
"Frasier: Let's go, no, not another word. Down to the lake. "
"Donny: OK, I've got a... "
"Donny: Alice, it's OK, honey "
"Niles: All right, you wait here, I'll get Donny. [enters kitchen saying] You know, Roz is heading down to the lake to catch that sunset... "
"Frasier: And you should be going with her too For God's sake, I told the two of you I withdraw my objection. Come on, let's go "
"Roz: I'm really worried about leaving Alice here alone. "
"Frasier: Roz, listen, I will attend to the baby. I was just about to make myself a cup of tea anyway. Now come on, let's go. March, both of you Out the door You're going to catch that romantic sunset if I have to drag you down there myself. "
"Frasier: Good lord, I just can't believe the two of them. Ridiculous behavior My God... AAH "
"Frasier: Daphne "
"Daphne: I'm sorry, did I startle you? "
"Frasier: No, no, no, no, no. That's quite alright. It's just that if Niles knew you were here he would never... well, forgive himself for not being here to greet you. "
"Daphne: Oh, he wasn't expecting me. My plans changed and I thought I'd drive up and join you all. "
"Frasier: Oh, well isn't that nice? You've got to leave "
"Daphne: Why? "
"Frasier: No, well you see, Niles is up here for what I think you Brits call a 'dirty weekend' with someone... "
"Daphne: Ooh... "
"Frasier: And the someone happens to be Roz. "
"Daphne: Roz? You mean, Roz Roz? "
"Frasier: Yes, yes Now, you've got to get out of here. "
"Daphne: But I just drove two hours and it's getting dark outside "
"Frasier: All right, I'll tell you what, I'll tell you what. There's a nice bed and breakfast just up the road. I think Dad, you, and I should all stay there this evening, alright? "
"Daphne: All right. If you don't mind, could I use the bathroom first? "
"Frasier: No, no, of course, right in there. "
"Frasier: Oh, dear God. "
"Roz: Where's Donny? "
"Niles: Well, he can't be in the kitchen, Frasier would have seen him. "
"Roz: Look, the door He must be up there. "
"Niles: You keep a lookout, I'll go get him. "
"Roz: OK. "
"Niles: Why don't I take over here and you can join Roz? "
"Frasier: For the love of God If I'd known the two of you were gonna take my words this seriously I would have chosen them more carefully. For God's sake, get out of here, get down to that lake "
"Roz: You know, I really think I should check on Alice. "
"Frasier: No, no, Roz, your baby is just fine. I burped her once and she went out like a light. Come on, let's go, Niles. "
"Niles: Oh, you know, I am thinking about it. I think it's much more romantic to stay here by the fire than watch some sunset. Why don't you clear out so we can have our privacy? "
"Frasier: Well, alright. "
"Frasier: On the other hand, you know, you can enjoy the fire all night long. You've only got ten more minutes for the sunset. "
"Martin: Are you going to get some ammo while it's still daylight? It's almost sunset. "
"Frasier: Don't tell me, tell them "
"Martin: Is that the bathroom? "
"Frasier: No. "
"Niles: Yes, it is. "
"Frasier: It's out of order. "
"Frasier: Let me check again. "
"Frasier: My God, one of the pipes is burst and the other one's knocking. "
"Martin: Fine, is there one down the hallway there? [points to the door Niles is blocking] "
"Niles: No. "
"Frasier: Yes, there is "
"Niles: No, it's out of order too "
"Martin: Well, it's a good thing I brought all that beer "
"Frasier: You know, Niles, you're behaving awfully strangely. What the heck is going on? "
"Niles: What do you mean? "
"Frasier: I mean that you show absolutely no desire to be alone with Roz I'm starting to have serious doubts about this so- called 'romance' "
"Niles: Oh, really? Well, does this look so-called to you? Come here, Pookie "
"Donny: That's why the door was stuck. You two, why didn't you tell me? "
"Frasier: Donny? "
"Daphne: Donny? "
"Niles: Daphne? "
"Donny: Daphne? "
"Frasier: What are you doing here? "
"Donny: Well, Niles invited me. "
"Frasier: Oh, did he? "
"Donny: Yeah, it was really nice of him. Roz and I had a chance to catch up on old times. "
"Daphne: Oh, that's right, you two used to date, didn't you? "
"Frasier: Well, isn't that nice of Niles to organize this little reunion? "
"Daphne: I hope I don't have anything to worry about "
"Donny: Oh come on, are you kidding? "
"Frasier: Well, obviously Roz and Niles can barely keep their HANDS OFF EACH OTHER You know, why don't all of us get out of here? Give these two little kids a little privacy. "
"Daphne: You know, we could use some privacy of our own. Dr. Crane tells me there's a bed and breakfast up the road from here. "
"Donny: Really? "
"Daphne: Really. "
"Daphne: Even more fun if we both go. "
"Donny: Yes, yes. "
"Martin: Well, come on, Frasier, let's go get a nice Sloppy Joe. I'll pay for it. "
"Frasier: Something tells me I'll pay for it too. Oh, I realize now that you two don't need my blessing, so I'll just leave you with this. "
"Time: 21"

"patience: "
"Frasier: I'm sorry Niles, it's just that Donny and Daphne seem very happy together. Now either it's true love, in which case it's too late for you to declare yourself, or it's just a temporary infatuation-- "
"Niles: It's got to be It's got to be "
"Frasier: --in which case it will pass, and then you can make your move. In the meantime I suggest that you start looking elsewhere, maybe make a fresh start, do something to get your mind off of Daphne. "
"Niles: I know, it's just difficult. "
"s: "
"Martin: So how's the world treating you? "
"Roz: Like dirt. My social life is non-existent. Every time I meet a guy who's halfway decent, all I have to do is mention I have a kid and he runs like a cheap pair of pantyhose. "
"Martin: (laughing) Well, maybe you and Niles can cheer each other up. "
"Niles: Dad-- "
"Roz: Why, what's his problem? "
"Martin: Oh, Daphne's got a new boyfriend and it's eating him up. "
"Niles: (mortified) Dad "
"Roz: What? (to Niles, avid for the gossip) You've got a thing for Daphne? "
"Martin: You didn't know that after all these years? "
"Roz: No I can't believe Daphne never told me "
"Martin: Well, how could she? She doesn't know either. "
"Roz: (laughing) You're kidding "
"Niles: (glaring) Yes Yes, he's a great kidder. Now, Dad, you run along, and you be very careful crossing streets. "
"Martin: (to Roz) Six years, can you believe it? "
"Roz: What? "
"Martin: Some people just don't know when it's time to pull the plug. "
"Niles: (calling after Martin) Well, I won't make that mistake twice "
"Roz: So let me get this straight. You've been hot for Daphne all this time and you've never made a move? "
"Niles: I was a happily married man. "
"Roz: You were never happy, and you've been separated for almost two years. "
"Niles: Well, somehow the right moment never came along. "
"Roz: Oh, come on. I'm not trying to make you feel bad. It's just that you've been waiting all this time, and now she's got a boyfriend? (laughing) My god, that is really pathetic "
"Niles: Obviously you've never let someone you've grown to care deeply about get away. "
"Roz: Well, sure I have. "
"Niles: I'm not talking about when the migrant workers leave at the end of the picking season. "
"Roz: No, really. I've had a couple of boyfriends I shouldn't have let get away. "
"Niles: Serious relationships? "
"Roz: Yeah. In fact, I can name one right off the top of my head. That lawyer I gave you? Donny? "

"Roz: What's so funny? "
"Niles: (laughing) I'll tell you in a minute. I just want to savor it. You've been having all the fun. "
"Roz: (laughing along with him) So tell me? "
"Niles: Donny is Daphne's boyfriend. "
"Roz: (upset) That's not funny When did this happen? "
"Niles: She met him when he was working on my case. "
"Roz: Wow. And I was calling you a loser. "
"Niles: You never called me a loser. "
"Roz: In my head I was. "
"Niles: Well, at the moment I have to agree with you. I've had plenty of opportunities and I always chickened out. "

"Frasier: You know Niles, I think I'm going to have a dinner party. Care to comment? "
"Niles: I love the idea, what's the occasion? "
"Frasier: I got the idea last night when we bumped into Jean and Hollis Ashley at the symphony, I've always wanted to get to know them better. "
"Niles: Me too, they're such a charming "
"couple: they remind me of Maris and me when we were happy. "
"Frasier: Really? I must have been sick that day "
"door: It's Roz wearing an elegant long dress. "
"Frasier: Oh, well Roz... "
"Roz: Thank you. "
"Frasier: Is that your dry cleaning? "
"Roz: No, it's Daphne's. Alice spit up on her dress so I had to have it dry-cleaned for her. I also had to buy her new shoes and detail her car, I've never seen a kid so sick "
"Daphne: Hey Roz, you look gorgeous. "
"Roz: How much time do we have? "
"Daphne: Twenty minutes. I better get changed. "
"Niles: Where are you going? "
"Roz: Daphne has friends at the British Consulate and they're having a big reception tonight, she has an invitation. "
"Daphne: Yes, who knows Roz? Maybe you'll meet some English lord who'll make you a lady. "
"Niles: I think at this point it would take the actual Lord to make her a lady. "
"Frasier: Well let's pick a date for our party. Got your book? "
"Niles: Hmm. "
"dates: "
"Frasier: The 1st is no good. "
"Niles: "
"No: wine club. The second? "
"Frasier: Library fundraiser. Third? "
"Niles: No. Fourth, fifth, sixth? "
"Frasier: No. No, no, no. "
"Niles: What about the 11th? "
"Frasier: No, concert tickets. "
"Niles: I don't have that marked. "
"Frasier: Yes, I'm taking a date. "
"Niles: Well isn't that nice. 11th, 'expect desperate last minute call from F.' Anything the next week? "
"Frasier: No, no... Oh, I've got the 19th. "
"Niles: I've got the 19th "
"Frasier: The 19th it is then. "
"Niles: Huzzah "
"Martin: Hey, boys. "
"Niles: Hey, Dad. "
"Martin: What’s up? "
"Frasier: Well actually, after an unusually protracted game of dueling date books, Niles and I have set a mutually acceptable evening for an inteen soiree. We're having a dinner party "
"Martin: Oh, sounds good Any date but the 19th "
"Niles: Well, what is wrong with the 19th? "
"Martin: My poker game's here that night. "
"Frasier: Can't you reschedule it? "
"Martin: No It's always the third Saturday of the month and everybody shows. Jimmy once postponed his daughter's wedding just so that he could be here, and if you ever saw his daughter you'd know how risky that was. "
"Frasier: Dad, you know we wouldn't ask if there was any other date that worked "
"Martin: Do you really expect me to give up my game so you can have one of your inteen soirees? "
"Niles: I knew he knew what that meant "
"Frasier: Dad, please, couldn't you at least make a few calls? I tell you what, if you can change the day - I'll cover your losses that night. "
"Martin: Well all right, I'll try. But you know, these guys live pretty busy lives - I can't always get in touch with them. "
"Niles: Let's hope that dog track has a PA system. "
"Frasier: Alright, Niles, back to our party... got any thoughts on a caterer? "
"Niles: Well... Cornell Evans. He's pricey but he's the best. "
"Frasier: Let's book him. "
"Niles: Oh marvelous "
"line: "
"Frasier: Oh, I'm sorry Dad, I didn't know you were on the line. "
"Frasier: Oh my goodness. "
"Daphne: Well we're off to the ball, don't wait up for us. "
"Niles: Daphne, wait, wait, wait, wait, there's something on the back of your dress. "
"Daphne: Oh my God, it looks like bleach or something The dry cleaner must have done it "
"Roz: I saw it, it's nothing. "
"Daphne: You saw it? "
"Roz: Don't worry, it's hardly noticeable. "
"Daphne: Dr. Crane noticed it "
"Roz: That's because he's always looking at your... "
"Niles: Roz "
"Daphne: Well, I can't go now "
"Roz: Why not? "
"Daphne: This is the only formal dress I've got. "
"Roz: Wait I've got the rest of my dry cleaning down in the car, I bet I have something you can wear, I'll be right back. "
"Niles: You know Daphne, I bet I would be able to get that out for you. "
"Daphne: No The cleaner's spoiled it, he can damn well fix it "
"Niles: It would just take... "
"Frasier: Can I speak to Cornell, please? Yes, of course I'll hold. "
"Niles: Daphne, I mean it, if I just had a toothbrush and a jeweler's... "
"Frasier: Niles "
"Frasier: How long is he going to keep me on hold "
"Niles: Hey Roz, did you find any kind of thing... "
"Frasier: Hello Cornell, yes Frasier Crane here. Listen, I'm hoping that you're not booked on the 19th. Oh Lord, yes I understand that... yes, same to you. Alright, bye-bye. Damn Don't you know it, the only date he's got free is the 11th. Damn those concert tickets "
"Niles: Oh, you know who might be "
"available: Tyler Wilkins. "
"Frasier: Doesn't he work with Cornell? "
"Niles: Oh, dear God, no. They are mortal "
"enemies: they were catering a seafood banquet when Cornell flew into a rage because Tyler had ordered Mahi Mahi instead of Ahi. Of course, Tyler blamed it on Cornell's stutter and they haven't spoken since. [into phone] Tyler, Niles Crane, yes. I was wondering if you were available on the 19th? Wonderful, dinner for... 10. That's great, I'll call you later on and we'll discuss the menu. Thanks, bye-bye. "
"Frasier: That is wonderful, alright, now you, me and the fabulous Ashbys. That leaves six chairs to fill. "
"Niles: Well, we'll have to have Joan and Ted Birkin, that's a no- brainer. "
"Frasier: Technically that's two no-brainers, forget the Birkins. "
"Niles: Wait a minute, you can't just steamroll over me, I want the Birkins "
"Frasier: I don't "
"Niles: Well, I do "
"Frasier: All right, we each have a right to blackball, let's say, three guests. We will each get an equal voice. "
"Niles: That's fair enough. "
"Frasier: That's three for me and three for you. And just to get the blackball rolling... Bye-bye, Birkins "
"Niles: What about John and Carol Peterson, everyone loves them. "
"Frasier: Not everyone Blackball "
"Niles: Why? "
"Frasier: No, no, we never question the blackball. We just bow to its will. "
"Niles: Fine, Nina and Arch Duncan. "
"Frasier: “The Drunken Duncans?' Have you lost your... Wait a minute. You loathe the Duncans, you just want me to waste a blackball. "
"Niles: That's insane, I adore the Duncans. "
"Frasier: Really? Well, perhaps I misjudged them. Very well Niles, the Duncans it is. Nina and Arch... "
"Niles: Oh, stop it, they're hideous Blackball What about the Walburts? "
"Frasier: Oh, I like the Walburts. "
"Niles: Finally. Gordons? "
"Frasier: I love the Gordons, now we're rolling. "
"Niles: How about the DiFalcos? "
"Frasier: Blackball She is a twit. How about the Whitneys? "
"Niles: Blackball He's a dolt. [Frasier begins eating another nut] Cromwells? "
"Frasier: Blackball "
"Niles: Look, if you're gonna... Wait a minute, you're out of blackballs... this is a dried-up old fig "
"Frasier: So is Lucy Cromwell, I don't want her at my party. "
"Niles: The Cromwell's are in - the guest list is complete. Now let's start calling everyone. "
"Frasier: Yes - starting with our guests of "
"honor: the Ashbys. Hello Hollis, Frasier Crane calling. Listen, Niles and I are planning on having a dinner party on the 19th and... oh. They're leaving to Africa on the 19th. Oh, gee that's a shame. We were sorta building the evening around you. Oh They've got the 11th free. "
"Niles: No good, we've got that concert. "
"Frasier: I didn't ask you to that. The 11th should be just fine. Oh no, they've got a conflict. Oh, well that's no problem - they were our very next call. We absolutely adore the Duncans. All right, we'll see you then. "
"Niles: Not the drunken Duncans? "
"Frasier: I'm sorry Niles, they've got plans for the Ashbys on the 11th, so they're invited too. "
"Niles: Well, I want my blackball back. "
"Frasier: Oh, the blackball was dropped, it can never be... "
"Niles: Shut up "
"Frasier: At least we're getting the Ashbys - in fact, you know what? There's an additional plus - seeing as we're changing our plans to the 11th, it means Cornell can cater. "
"Niles: Oh quick, you call Cornell, I'll call Tyler and tell him we're canceling. Tyler. It's Niles Crane again. Yes, listen, it turns out we're not going to need you on the 19th. "
"Frasier: Yes, Cornell please. "
"Niles: No, no, no, we're not going with someone else. Cornell? What gave you that idea? "
"Frasier: Cornell, Frasier Crane. Listen, we've changed our party plans and... "
"Frasier: This one's mine, I can smell my cologne "
"Niles: Well, thanks to your keen sense of smell, we've lost both caterers. I suppose we can always get Kiki Price. "
"Frasier: She still in business? "
"Niles: Yes, they dropped the charges "
"Frasier: Oh. I better phone the Duncans, hope we can catch them before 'Happy Hour' Hello, Nina. Frasier Crane calling. Listen, Niles and I are having the Ashbys over and a few other people for a dinner and we were hoping that you could join us on the 11th... Don't cry, Nina, please. Yes, well, I've always loved you too. What? Joaquin? Joaquin is coming in from Argentina, you'd like him to, to join us... well? "
"Niles: Joaquin? Joaquin Warens, he's the conductor of the Buenos Aires Philharmonic. "
"Frasier: My God, that's right, they were just down there, they must have met him. We would love to have Joaquin join us Oh, that's splendid. Alright, right, then we'll see you on the 11th. The 11th. Alright, take two swizzle sticks and stand them up side by side. Eleven, that's right. "
"Niles: We've got Joaquin "
"Frasier: Well, don't cry for me, Arch & Nina Alright, let's see, we've got the Duncans and Joaquin, and that means we're going to have to cut out two couples. Well, the Cromwells and the... "
"Niles: Gordons "
"Frasier: The Gordons. That leaves us short by one, we need a single female. "
"Niles: Oh Roz, perfect timing. "
"Roz: What's up? "
"Niles: We're having a dinner party and we need an interesting single woman. Do you know anybody? We're desperate "
"Roz: Excuse me "
"Frasier: Naturally we thought of you first, Roz, but this isn't really your kind of crowd. "
"Roz: What? Sophisticated, cultured, is that why you don't think I'd fit in with your snooty elitist friends, I'm not genteel enough? "
"Frasier: Now Roz... "
"Roz: Now Roz, my ass. I'm just as refined as you are. Shut up, Niles "
"Martin: Well, I hope you're satisfied. I got everyone to change. We're gonna have it on the 11th. "
"Frasier: The 11th? "
"Martin: Yeah, and it wasn't easy either, Mel had to reschedule his polyp surgery. "
"Niles: Well Dad, you are really going to laugh at this. Frasier and I rescheduled our dinner party for the 11th. "
"Martin: I'm not changing it back I'm not "
"Frasier: Now Dad, I would never even consider asking you to do such a thing. I tell you what, there's no reason why we can't hold both parties simultaneously. The apartment's certainly big enough. "
"Martin: I know what you're trying to do, and it won't work "
"Frasier: What, dad? I'm serious, no, no, we can share the buffet table and we can even have the harpist learn a couple of Bobby Darin tunes for your crowd "
"Martin: I can stand it if you can "
"Frasier: Of course, we will have to dim the lights at one point. You see, Nina Duncan always insists on sharing her extensive collection of slides from the summer she danced Agamemmnom at Jacob's Pillow. "
"Martin: All right, I'll change it. "
"Frasier: You call Kiki, and the Walburts. And I'll talk to Roz. "
"Niles: I'm on it "
"Roz: Come on, pick something "
"Daphne: Pick what? This one isn't dressy enough This one doesn't fit. [picks up a glittery blue dress which covers only everything between the cleavage and the thighs] And this one, well, it's hardly appropriate for a posh cocktail reception "
"Frasier: Excuse me, Roz, listen, I just came to apologize. "
"Roz: Whatever "
"Daphne: What happened? "
"Roz: He said I wasn't classy enough to come to his fancy dinner party "
"Frasier: Roz, you know I didn't mean that. "
"Daphne: Oh, get in line. I've lived here for six years and the only time I'm asked to that table is when I'm holding a freakin' serving spoon "
"Frasier: It's just a silly dinner party, what's everyone getting so upset about? "
"Daphne: Oh, let's just go. Oh, I suppose this color might look nice on me after all. "
"Niles: I've left messages for Kiki and the Walburts. "
"Roz: Could you two please leave, so Daphne can change "
"Niles: Daphne, you're not actually going out in that, are you? "
"Daphne: That's it, I'm staying home. "
"Roz: No, just try it, we can accessorize it. "
"Niles: With what? A lamp post and a public defender? "
"Frasier: Lord, was that the answering machine? "
"Allison: Hi, it's Allison Walburt. And, yes, count us in for the 11th. Looking forward to it, bye. "
"Frasier: That's wonderful, I so enjoy the Walburts. "
"Harry: Who was that? "
"Allison: We just got invited to a dinner party at Dr. Crane's. "
"Harry: Which Dr. Crane? "
"Allison: Does it matter? You get the one, you get that other one. Personally, I think the whole arrangement's a little... "
"Harry: Is that thing off the hook? "
"Allison: Oh my God "
"Time: 13"
":15) "
"Niles: What you suppose she meant by that? "
"Frasier: Obviously, she thinks we're always together. That we're some sort of 'couple.' "
"Niles: That's ridiculous, we spend lots of times apart. [takes a bit of fluff from Frasier's jacket like a wife would do to her husband] Besides, who is she to talk? Look at her and Harry - they go everywhere together. "
"Frasier: They're married, Niles Still, there's no reason for her to call us odd "
"Niles: Wait, she never called us odd - listen. "
"tape: "
"Allison: Does it matter? You get the one, you get that other one. Personally, I think the whole arrangement's a little... "
"Harry: Is that thing off the hook? "
"Allison: Oh my God "
"Niles: You see, she never said odd - we're getting upset over nothing. "
"Frasier: Nothing? Is there a good end to that sentence? 'Personally, I think the whole arrangement is a little...' What? Charming? "
"Niles: Really, will you stop overreacting? "
"Frasier: Perhaps she has a point. Ever since your divorce you have become more and more attached to me. Maybe that's why she said what she said. "
"Niles: What? "
"Frasier: You get Frasier, you get that Niles "
"Niles: She didn't say that. She said 'you get the one, you get that other one.' What makes you think that you're the one and I'm that other one? "
"Frasier: I am the one giving the party, and you are that other one "
"Niles: I'm the one that invited her, so that makes you that other one "
"Niles: This is absurd Why don't we just call Allison up and ask her what she thinks is so strange about us? We can both get her on an extension. "
"Frasier: Better yet, why don't we just get on a bicycle built for two, ride over there and ask her what she thinks is so strange about us "
"Frasier: Hello. Yes, hello Nina. Alright, what can I do for you? No, no, dear, you called me. Oh yes, Joaquin can only eat certain foods - well, yes I'd be glad to accommodate them. Let's see, alright... Rice, beans, jerked beef. Any particular reason? I see. Interesting. OK. Bye. "
"Niles: Why is Joaquin on such a strict diet? "
"Frasier: Because the Joaquin they're bringing to dinner is... [falls on sofa] ...their foster child From a tiny village on the pompus. He speaks no English and he gets nauseated when he eats American food "
"Niles: So, he's not the conductor of the Buenos Aires Philharmonic? "
"Frasier: Oh, you are so that other one Where are we going to find someone to babysit a nine year old child? "
"Daphne: "
"Roz: Quit your blubbering and just pick something, dammit "
"Frasier: Roz- "
"Roz: Now what? "
"Frasier: You were right. You know, you would be a welcome addition to any party. "
"Roz: Oh, you don't have to say that. "
"Frasier: No honestly, Niles and I want you to join us for dinner. "
"Roz: You mean it? "
"Frasier: In fact, we're having someone who might make a very interesting dinner companion for you. "
"Roz: He's not some stuffy old coot, is he? "
"Frasier: No, no, no.. "
"Niles: Young "
"Frasier: Yes, very young "
"Roz: OK, thanks "
"Frasier: Not exactly my wish list, but at least we've got the Ashbys. "
"Niles: Allison Walburt can say what she wants, why should we care a whit about what anybody else thinks. Am I right? "
"Frasier: Absolutely Dad, do you think we're odd? "
"Martin: No, you're not odd. You're just special Your mother told me that when you were kids and I still believe it. "
"Frasier: Yes, but do you think we spend too much time together? "
"Martin: You're close, lots of brothers are close. "
"Frasier: Yes, I suppose you're right about that. The Gershwins, the Wright Brothers... "
"Niles: I told you we were getting upset over nothing. "
"Martin: Course, then there were the Collier brothers "
"Niles: Collier brothers? "
"Martin: Couple of nuttos that shared an apartment in New York their whole lives. They even built a maze out of newspapers in there that only they knew how to get through. They collapsed on one of them and the other one just sat there with the dead body until the neighbors complained about the smell You recycle right, Niles? "
"Frasier: You know, maybe it wouldn't be the worst idea if we went our own ways a bit more. "
"Niles: It's possible we have grown a tad dependent on one another. "
"Frasier: Perhaps this is just the warning we need. Today we're planning a dinner party... tomorrow we're wearing matching pajamas and washing each other's hair Let's face it, Niles, we are one stone's throw away from becoming the neighborhood kooks Right down to the local children ringing our doorbell and running away. "
"Niles: Now Frasier, you are letting your imagination get the better of you. Come on, let's go make a seating chart. "
"Frasier: You always know how to cheer me up. "
"Niles: Oh Daphne, isn't that Roz's dress? "
"Daphne: Yes, it was really the only thing that looked good on me. Come on, Roz, we don't want to be late "
"Daphne: Doesn't she look beautiful "
"Roz: Oh, shut it, Daphne I know you think I look like a hooker. "
"Daphne: No, I said it made me look like a hooker. On you... well, it works. "
"Frasier: Hello? Yes, yes. Oh Lord, I'm so sorry you can't make it. That's all right. Yes, some other time. Goodbye. "
"Niles: Please not the Ashbys. "
"Frasier: Family emergency. Apparently it's so urgent they didn't have time to think up a plausible excuse "
"Niles: So where does that leave us? "
"Frasier: Well, let's see... we have a third-rate caterer with a record, a couple of lushes, a couple who think we're both nutcases, an Argentine wild child and Roz Dinner is served "
"Niles: I still have one blackball left. "
"Frasier: At this point I don't think one is going to make any difference. "
"Niles: It will to me, I'm using it on myself. Blackball "
"Frasier: We are the Collier brothers Why don't we just face the "
"inevitable: let us just cancel the whole damn thing. "
"Niles: Of course, canceling the party twenty minutes later - people'll think we're strange "
"Frasier: Frankly, I'm sick and tired about giving a damn about what other people think. You know, most of them are one ball away from not being here in the first place. "
"Niles: You're right. So we spend a lot of time together, so what? I enjoy it. "
"Frasier: So do I, Niles. You know, why don't we make those calls tomorrow to cancel? I'm famished, why don't we just head over to 'Companion' for dinner, my treat. "
"Niles: Unless you think it's too odd to have dinner together. "
"Frasier: I don't think we're in any danger of that. If our relationship became truly odd I think we're both intelligent enough to recognize the signs. "

" "
"Martin: Hey boys, how was dinner? "
"Niles: Oh, let's just say when I picked my lobster out of the tank I had no idea that he was in for a better evening than I was. "
"Martin: What happened? "
"Frasier: Well, it started off well enough. First they seated us at a superb table, much better than the one next to us - where, unfortunately, they sat Daphne and Donny. "
"Martin: Oh, jeez. "
"Frasier: They were being very affectionate, of "
"course: whispering, laughing, holding hands... "
"Niles: This in a place where people were trying to eat. "
"Frasier: Well, in an attempt to make things better I suggested that Niles and I switch seats so that he could face the other table. Of course, only moments later they seated Maris there with her new boyfriend. Also being affectionate. "
"Niles: Grooming each other like spider monkeys She was deliberately taunting me, playing the same coquettish games we used to play in "
"restaurants: batting her eyes and coyly hiding behind her breadstick. And then to top it all, the Pouille Foussé we ordered was a grave disappointment. "
"Frasier: Yes, well I urged him to send it back, but no, he didn't want to create a scene in front of Daphne. "
"Niles: Not that she would have even noticed, the way Donny was feeding her forkfuls of risotto, as if she had lost her arms instead of her mind, what is she doing with him? "
"Martin: Well, some days it doesn't pay to get out of bed. "
"Niles: Well, at the Shangri-La, the highlight of my day is getting out of bed, so I can slam it back up into the wall "
"Martin: How long are you gonna stay there? You can afford to go back to the Montana now, can't you? "
"Niles: Yes, but thanks to Frasier there's a tenant living there "
"Frasier: May I remind you that you begged me to find you a sublet - Someone austere and dignified enough not to offend your starchy neighbors? "
"Niles: Frasier, I'm not trying to blame you, it's just that my whole world has crashed down around me and I want to go home. "
"Frasier: Well, I'm sorry Niles, he's still got two months left on his sublet. "
"Martin: Can't you give him a call, lean on him a little bit? "
"Frasier: Dad, the man has a lease, I can't very well call him up and ask him to move out. "
"Martin: How was dinner? "
"Daphne: Wonderful. You should have come over and joined us. "
"Niles: Oh well, it looked like that you had enough to contend with, what with your table's fork shortage. "
"Daphne: Oh, Donny takes such good care of me. You know, after you left, I made the tiniest comment about not liking the Pouille Foussé and he sent it back. That snooty wine steward argued with him but Donny made a bit of a scene with the owner and the next thing you knew, our entire meal was on the house. I've never been prouder of him. "
"Niles: Frasier, I wanna go home. "
"Frasier: I'll call Dr. MacLowery. "
"Latimer: Dr. Crane, you're back. "
"Niles: Yes, Mrs. Latimer. Fortunately my sublet was able to move out early. "
"Latimer: I trust your tour was a success? "
"Niles: A triumph. "
"Latimer: Good, take care. "
"Frasier: Tour? "
"Niles: I could hardly let these people know where I was living. I told them I was on a lecture tour of Africa so they wouldn't try to contact me. "
"Frasier: Ah You know, Niles, maybe he isn't here. Maybe we should just let ourselves in. "
"Niles: Oh... I'm home. Oh, I can already feel the last four months dropping away. "
"Frasier: Yes, soon Africa will be just a memory. "
"Niles: I just want to close my eyes, and savor the serenity... "
"Niles: What the hell is that? "
"Frasier: It's Dr. MacLowery "
"Frasier: Dr. MacLowery What are you doing? "
"MacLowery: Oh, that was a ball change, leading to a riff drop. You've got to 'Lick it & Stick it.' "
"Frasier: When did you take up tap dancing? "
"MacLowery: Oh, years ago. I figured if I didn't dance, I'd go crazy. "
"Niles: I'm not sure he caught it in time. "
"Niles: Ooh, baseboard, baseboard "
"Frasier: Dr. MacLowery, please - the neighbors "
"MacLowery: Tell me about it Why, those bunch of sourpusses. All they do is complain Sunshine-rain "
"Niles: Oh well, look who it is, it's the tenants' board come to welcome me home. Carol and Alfred Larkin, you remember my brother, Frasier. Oh, and Mr. Probst. "
"Probst: See here, Crane. We abhor noise in this building. "
"Niles: Oh, I couldn't agree more. "
"Alfred: What do you call that? "
"Frasier: I believe that was 'Lick it & Stick it' "
"Carol: This has been going on for months. We would have contacted you if we had known how to. "
"Niles: Well, I am sorry but Dr. MacLowery.... "
"Alfred: Dr. Crane, I'm afraid the board is leaning toward rescinding your lease. "
"Niles: What? Why? "
"Probst: Because you're a menace, Crane. You always have been. You have something of a reputation in this building, what with all the raucous parties you've hosted. I'm not a well man. I have a serious heart problem and I demand quiet, we all do. "
"Niles: Well, Mr. Probst, I assure you... "
"Probst: Uh-uh. We're having a board meeting tomorrow evening in which we intend to discuss your situation, and if I were you I wouldn't plan on unpacking. "
"Carol: Nice seeing you again. "
"TO: "
"Daphne: It was good of you to go to all this trouble for your brother, Dr. Crane. "
"Frasier: Oh well, in a way I felt responsible. "
"Niles: Oh, really? I don't why. Just because you sublet my apartment to Bo Jangles the Loon? "
"Daphne: Ooh I'll get it. "
"Frasier: Niles, will you relax? "
"Niles: How can I? In an hour these people will throw me right out of my home. "
"Frasier: Which they won't do if you show them a good time at this little reception. A couple of drinks, some food, some witty conversation, they'll realize what an asset you are to this building. "
"Roz: Hey, guys. "
"Niles: Hey, Roz. "
"Frasier: Hi, Roz. "
"Roz: Great party, Niles I was a little surprised to get your last-minute invitation. You're not trying to set me up with anybody, are you? "
"Niles: Don't be ridiculous. "
"Roz: Good. "
"Niles: You're here because the caterer cancelled. Now listen, I need you to open the wine, cut up some limes and hang up this coat. "
"Roz: You actually think that I'm so hard-up for a night out that I'd spend an evening pushing drinks in 'God's Waiting Room'? "
"Niles: Shush "
"Frasier: Roz, please "
"Roz: You're paying for the babysitter. "
"Frasier: All right, done. "
"Martin: What am I, the dishwasher? "
"Frasier: No, Dad, you were invited because... well, it just wouldn't be a party without you. Although there may be a few women here who are unattached, who might just take a shine to an old debonair dog like yourself. "
"Martin: I'm just a piece of meat to you guys, aren't I? "
"Daphne: Oh, there goes that damn loose earring again Thank goodness it didn't fall in the punch bowl. We don't want someone choking on it, do we? "
"Frasier: Yes, although nothing says 'party' like a tracheotomy. "
"Carol: You must tell us all about your African tour, Dr. Crane. "
"Alfred: Yes, did the local people actually enjoy your lectures? "
"Niles: Well yes, quite a bit. Except of course for the pygmies. Most of it went right over their heads. "
"Niles: I'll get it. "
"Niles: Oh, the rest of the board, pleased to see you. "
"Latimer: Dr. Crane, while you were on the subcontinent did you happen to spot any rare African water fowl? "
"Niles: Just one, but it was already spotted "
"Niles: I'll get it. "
"Frasier: For God's sake, Niles, will you do something with this damn bird? "
"Niles: Onto your perch. Here you go. Over here. "
"Baby: Niles sucks. "
"Niles: The boys at the Shangri-La used to love teaching you things like that. So tiring. "
"Baby: Bite me, Niles. "
"Niles: Right back at you. Frasier, please hurry with the hors d'oeuvres, the guests are already hostile towards me. I'm not going to win any points by starving them. "
"Baby: Stuff it, Niles. "
"Niles: Oh, don't tempt me "
"Latimer: Dr. Crane. "
"Niles: Yes. "
"Latimer: Who is that distinguished-looking man over there? "
"Latimer: I've been trying to catch his eye but he's far too engrossed in that gardening book. "
"Niles: Well, that's actually my father, Martin. Dad? Don't mind him, he's painfully shy. "
"Latimer: Oh, I know just how he feels. I'm a bit of a shrinking violet myself. Martin "
"Roz: Do you see that obnoxious old lecher? "
"Niles: Well, you're going to have to be a lot more specific. "
"Roz: The one in the blue jacket, I'm this close to slapping him. "
"Niles: Wait, wait, wait, that is Mr. Hawkins. He is the vice- president of the tenants' board. "
"Roz: Well, I don't care who he is, he just pinched me. "
"Frasier: Roz, please, the man is eighty and arthritic. How hard can he pinch? "
"Frasier: Ow "
"Niles: It's not working. People aren't talking, they're not mixing.... "
"Frasier: Niles Stop it, stop it. The party's just starting, everything's going to be just fine. "
"Frasier: Don't you touch me "
"Frasier: Daphne, how are those other... "
"Frasier: Baby? "
"Frasier: Oh, dear God This bird is dead. How did this happen? "
"Daphne: She must have eaten some of the hors d'oeuvres. "
"Frasier: You mean the ones I've just served to Niles's guests? "
"Niles: You are very welcome "
"Niles: Frasier, I'm so sorry, I completely overreacted. People really perked up once they saw those appetizers of yours. You know, I think the Niles Crane party curse has finally been laid to rest. What? "
"Niles: Will somebody please tell me what happened? "
"Frasier: I'm going to let Daphne tell you. "
"Niles: What is it? "
"Daphne: I don't mean to alarm you but there's something wrong with the hors d'oeuvres. "
"Niles: What? How do you know? "
"Daphne: A little bird told me. "
"Frasier: Sorry, I forgot the garnish. Just dreadfully embarrassed about this... give me that Thank you very much. It's just chef's prerogative. [quickly takes one out of Roz's hands which is just about to enter her mouth] Roz For God's sake. "
"Niles: Did you see how it happened? Anything? "
"Daphne: Well, I did hear her last words but... I don't think they'd be of much comfort to you. "
"Frasier: Oh Niles, I'm so sorry. My God, the mayonnaise must have gone bad, or the cranberry, or the paté. "
"Niles: Which one did she eat? "
"Frasier: I don't know. Daphne, smell her beak "
"Frasier: Alright, Niles, are you all right? "
"Niles: Yes, I just need a moment. "
"Carol: Oh, Dr. Crane? "
"Niles: That's long enough. "
"Carol: Excuse me, I'm afraid I spilt punch on my dress, I need a towel. "
"Daphne: No. You're much better off using... "
"Daphne: ...yeah, this bread. It's much more absorbent "
"Carol: Really? "
"Daphne: Yes. That's why they call it nature's sponge. "
"Carol: Alright. It's working. "
"Niles: Alright, what do we do now? "
"Frasier: Daphne, you get rid of Baby, I'll get rid of this tainted food. "
"Niles: But we still have a room full of hungry guests with nothing to serve them. "
"Daphne: Oh God, look at that She must have swallowed my earring, that's what killed her. "
"Niles: Oh, that means we don't have to destroy the hors d'oeuvres. Frasier, Frasier, stop Are there any left? "
"Frasier: Yes, we're in luck. This intrepid little crab puff has survived. Now all I need is a very sharp knife and sixteen toothpicks. "
"Roz: Niles "
"Roz: I'm really getting tired of these people. Some lady just handed me a piece of wet bread. "
"Niles: Oh, this party is doomed. "
"Frasier: No, Niles, listen. Don't panic, we've got everything we need to make more hors d'oeuvres. All we need is time, you get out there and stall. "
"Niles: Mrs. Latimer, can I get you some punch? "
"Latimer: Yes, your father went to get me some... but that was quite a while ago. "
"Niles: Allow me. "
"Latimer: By the way, where is that adorable bird of yours? "
"Niles: Um, she's resting. Travel really takes it out of her. "
"Latimer: You didn't take her with you to Africa, surely? "
"Niles: Well, she has family there. "
"Niles: Mr. Probst, having a good time? "
"Probst: Look here, Crane, if you're not going to feed us we might as well take the vote right now. "
"Niles: No, no, no, please. "
"Probst: I mean, you bring the hors d'oeuvres, you take the hors d'oeuvres away... what kind of a game is this you're playing with us? "
"Niles: Well I'm not, I'm not... Oh, what a good idea Why don't we all play a game? Anyone have any suggestions? "
"Carol: What about Murder? We played it at Irene Warner's party. It was a hoot. "
"Woman: How do we play? "
"Niles: Well here, someone tear off slips of paper and on one of them write the word 'Murderer.' And then we'll pass them out, and then everyone hide. We'll turn out the lights, then the murderer kills someone and they lay down on the floor, then we turn on the lights and the detective solves the crime. "
"Frasier: I tell you what, I'll volunteer to play the detective for the first round. Let the mayhem begin "
"Latimer: Oh, Martin, there you are Come, hide with me, I know a little nook where no one will find us. "
"Martin: This game's a lot scarier than I thought [exits in other direction] "
"Frasier: Alright? Turn out the lights, everyone hide. "
"Probst: Ah, can't see. "
"Roz: Oh, can I help you, sir? "
"Probst: I don't have my glasses, can you tell me what it says on this thing? "
"Roz: It says 'Murderer.' "
"Probst: Good. Then you're dead. "
"Roz: This party just gets better and better. "
"Frasier: How soon? "
"Daphne: I'm going as fast as I can. The first batch should be ready in five minutes. "
"Frasier: Alright, five minutes it is. Ready or not, here I come "
"Frasier: My goodness, the foul fiend has struck already. Turn the lights on. Good heavens, he's struck twice "
"Roz: Frasier... "
"Frasier: Uh-uh, once dead you cannot move or speak, take your cue from Mr. Probst. Alright, everyone. Did any of you see anything suspicious? Any odd behavior? "
"Alfred: Why don't you just guess, so we can get this thing over with. "
"Frasier: Not yet, this is very intriguing. I think I'm going to have to think about it for... five minutes or so. "
"Carol: Maybe this game was a bad idea. "
"Frasier: No, the fun's just started. I tell you what, let's turn off the lights again and we'll let our craven villain ply his dark trade once more. "
"Alfred: Are you quite sure those two didn't die of starvation? "
"Frasier: Very funny Would you just turn out the lights, please? "
"Frasier: Alright everyone, hide "
"Roz: Frasier, I have a question. "
"Frasier: No, Roz, no talking. "
"Roz: Just tell me, can the murderer commit suicide? "
"Frasier: Well no, Roz, that wouldn't make much sense, would it? "
"Roz: That's what I thought, but Mr. Probst is the one who murdered me. "
"Frasier: Well, was he? Well then, Mr. Probst, I don't think someone's playing by the rules, is he? You see, this way no-one else can get murdered, can they? Mr. Probst? "
"Roz: What is it? What are you doing? "
"Frasier: Nothing, Roz, nothing. "
"Roz: Are you taking his pulse? "
"Frasier: I'm trying to, I just can't find one. "
"Roz: Oh my God When he fell down, I thought it was part of the game. It didn't even look real. "
"Niles: Okay, it's time to wind the game up. The appetizers are ready, and may I say they are delicious. I think this party is finally back on track "
"Frasier: Niles I'm afraid Mr. Probst has passed on. "
"Niles: What? "
"Frasier: Yes, you see, I think that heart condition of his finally caught up with him. "
"Niles: Dead? No, no, no, he's sleeping. Old people love to nap. Mr. Probst, time to wake up. Mr. Probst... "
"Frasier: Niles, Niles, he's gone. "
"Niles: Oh my God, how could this happen? "
"Roz: Shouldn't we notify someone? "
"Niles: No, he was a widower, he had no children, he lived alone in this building for twenty-five years. This is so awful. Mr. Probst is right, I am a menace. "
"Frasier: No, Niles, this is not your fault. "
"Niles: But it happened at my party, it's all they will remember. I might as well pack my bags. "
"Frasier: No, I tell you what. There's no need for that. I think we can still get him out of here without anybody noticing. "
"Niles: How? "
"Frasier: You go find Dad. Tell him to call one of his friends at the police department. One of his good friends, right? I'll handle the rest. "
"Niles: All right. "
"Roz: What's the rest? "
"Frasier: I'm going to use the game to distract everybody. I will take everyone into the kitchen for questioning, thus drawing their attention from the bodies. "
"Roz: What do you mean, 'bodies'? "
"Frasier: Roz "
"Roz: No. "
"Frasier: Get down. "
"Roz: No, please no. "
"Frasier: All right, how about this? I will pay the airfare for that vacation of yours next month. "
"Roz: No way, it's just too creepy. First class? "
"Frasier: Business. "
"Roz: Done. "
"Frasier: All right, get down there. "
"Niles: Frasier, Frasier, Frasier, I found Dad hiding from Mrs. Latimer. He's called his friend. "
"Frasier: Great. Niles, start getting everyone in the kitchen. "
"Niles: Wait, wait, won't they wonder why there hasn't been another murder? "
"Frasier: Good point. "
"Roz: Could we move this along? "
"Frasier: Quiet "
"Martin: The wagon's on its way. When it gets here let me deal with it. "
"Niles: All right, thank you, Dad. I really appreciate this... "
"Frasier: Dad Can you do one more favor? You are now the killer. Listen, come on, you've got to murder somebody - preferably in the kitchen "
"Martin: Oh, come on You're not going to make someone lie down on this dirty floor again, are you? "
"Latimer: Oh, there you are, Martin. Have you been hiding from me? "
"Martin: Hiding? No, you're just the person I've been looking for. "
"Frasier: All right, turn on the lights, everyone. Roz, you okay? "
"Roz: Yeah, it's a carnival down here. "
"Frasier: Everyone. There has been another murder... in the kitchen. I'm ready to solve the crime, if you'll all join me... in the kitchen. "
"Carol: Why can't you solve it right here? "
"Frasier: Well I could, you see, but that wouldn't be proper. You see... the hors d'oeuvres are in there. Come along, people. We've got food. Don't touch the crime scene please, thank you very much. "
"Roz: Hurry, his fingers are getting stiff "
"Frasier: Before I determine the identity of the killer, there are a few questions I'd like to ask each of you. "
"Carol: I'll get it. "
"Frasier: No. No-one leaves until I've solved the crime. Except you, Dad. "
"Frasier: All right, then. I think I shall begin by drawing a diagram of where each of you was standing when the first murder occurred. "
"TO: "
"Frasier: So we have established Miss Finn was talking with Mr. Larkin in the upstairs hall at 8"
":14. And he muttered something. "
"Carol: Why do you keep looking out there? "
"Frasier: I'll ask the questions around here, Mrs. Larkin. "
"Alfred: They already told you. Your father killed Mrs. Latimer. Mrs. Hawkins saw him. "
"Frasier: Mrs. Hawkins thought she saw him "
"Latimer: No, Martin did kill me. He's got a lot to learn about playing gently. "
"Frasier: Mrs. Latimer, we have already broken the 'no-eating while dead' rule but we'll stand fast on the 'quiet' one. [stuffs a crab puff in her mouth] Now... "
"Carol: I'm bored and I'm going home. "
"Frasier: No, wait. "
"Frasier: You can't blame Niles for this because... "
"Frasier: My father is the killer Yes, the case is closed. Shall we have another round? "
"Alfred: Where's Probst? "
"Roz: He just left. He wasn't feeling well. "
"Niles: Yes, I hope he's alright, poor man. "
"Alfred: Well, who cares? I never liked the old coot anyway. "
"Niles: You didn't? "
"Alfred: I was planning on voting for you tonight just to annoy him. "
"Carol: Me, too "
"Niles: Well, why don't we vote right now? "
"Alfred: Consider it done. You're in, Crane. Welcome back. Carol, let's get out of here. "
"Roz: Doesn't he have anything stiffer than punch to drink? I don't like looking at dead bodies, much less touching them. "
"Frasier: I think he's got a bottle of vodka in the freezer, Roz. "
"Roz: Oh, great. "
"TO: Kitchen "
"TO: Living Room "
"Niles: Thank you so much for this second chance. I can assure you, from now on this will be the quietest apartment in the Montana. "
"Roz: OH, MY GOD "
"Niles: Goodnight. "

"Frasier: Evening, Niles. "
"Niles: Frasier. Everybody ready? "
"Frasier: Just about. "
"Niles: Ooh New cufflinks, those are very smart. "
"Frasier: Oh yeah, you've seen these before, haven't you? I always wear them with the tux. "
"Niles: Of course you do. Well still, nothing catches the eye like a sharp pair of cufflinks. "
"Frasier: And those are very nice too. "
"Niles: Oh, these... "
"Frasier: Gold? "
"Niles: Yes, well I knew you'd be wearing silver. I didn't want us to look alike, you know. "
"Roz: Hello. "
"Frasier: Hi, Roz. Come on in. "
"Roz: Sorry I'm late. "
"Frasier: That's all right. "
"Daphne: Hey, Roz. "
"Roz: Daphne, thank you so much for watching Alice. She's way overdue for her nap. Maybe I can get her to sleep. "
"Frasier: Oh, great. Well, set her down in my room. You know, we don't want to be late for that silent auction. "
"Roz: You know, I can't believe you've donated another 'Day Behind the Scenes of the Frasier Crane Show' this year. "
"Frasier: Well, why not, Roz? It's for a good cause. The Kelly Ann Grunther foundation does excellent work. "
"Roz: Well, you weren't trapped in my booth with that mouth breather for three hours last year. "
"Frasier: Well, he wasn't that bad. Some kind of engineer, wasn't he? "
"Roz: Well, he wasn't a dental hygienist, that's for sure. "
"Martin: Daphne, can you help me with these cuff links? "
"Daphne: Oh, all right. "
"Niles: What is this, Daphne? "
"Daphne: I'm chatting on-line with Donny. Oh, what's he saying? "
"Niles: Er, 'I can't wait to come home and see my wittle Engwish cwumpet.' "
"Daphne: I don't want him to think I've abandoned him. Would you mind taking over? Tell him I miss him too. "
"Niles: All right. "
"Daphne: I'm counting the days until he comes home and there's no-one I love more than my fuzzy wuzzy... "
"Computer: Good-bye. "
"Niles: I'm sorry, I seem to have lost him. "
"Daphne: Maybe I can get him back. "
"Frasier: Well, there we are. Alice is all squared away, she went right to sleep. Shall we? "
"Daphne: Have a good time. Don't spend too much. "
"Martin: Oh, don't worry about that. I've got a whole system worked out where I can get everything I want for the minimum bid. "
"Frasier: Dad, it's hardly in spirit with the evening. We're raising money for the Kelly Ann Grunther fund. "
"Martin: Oh, baloney. You just want to go there so you can hob-nob with all your snooty friends. "
"Frasier: Oh, that is not true. "
"Martin: Oh, yeah? Well, then answer me one "
"question: just who is Kelly Ann Grunther? "
"Frasier: Kelly Ann Grunther... is... the person responsible for the Kelly Ann Grunther foundation. "
"Martin: Well, what does that mean? "
"Frasier: Well, I guess she's just a very wealthy person that put up a lot of money, right? "
"Roz: I thought she had some kind of disease? "
"Niles: I always thought she was a scientist doing research. "
"Martin: So, in other words, it could have been called... [looks at Eddie] the Eddie Eddie-mund Foundation, so long as there was fancy food on silver platters. "
"Frasier: Have you seen anything exciting to bid on? "
"Niles: Well, no. It's mostly the same items as last year. [reads one] A day of beauty with internationally-known stylist Raphael. "
"Frasier: Yes, I see Missy Cromwell put down for that. "
"Niles: Well, can you blame her? Her last day of beauty was during the Johnson administration. "
"Frasier: You know, this is rather interesting. The Laureate Luncheon; break bread with three Nobel Prize winners. Drs. Alan Zafrin, Jane Randall and Terrance Quinn. "
"Niles: Oh my, it's an opportunity to meet with three of the greatest thinkers of our time. I'm amazed they even got them all in the same room together. You know Zafrin's a legendary recluse. "
"Frasier: Yes, well he'll be at 'Fiddlesticks' tomorrow at noon. [Niles signs his name] Good luck to you, Niles. You know, they say Quinn is quite witty. In nuclear physics circles he is referred to as 'the half life of the party.' "
"Martin: What do we have at this table? Ooh, the Windsor-monic 2000. Yeah... oh, isn't this the one they had to recall because the propane tanks kept on exploding? "
"Woman: They did? "
"Martin: Yeah, I sure feel sorry for this guy... Martin Crane. Better give himself an apron that says 'Kiss the Chef Goodbye'. "
"Jody: Are you bidding on this one too? "
"Roz: No, no, I'm Roz Doyle, Frasier Crane's producer. If you win this, you'll be spending the afternoon with me. "
"Jody: Well, I hope I do. I'm a big fan of the show. "
"Roz: Oh. "
"Noel: Hello, there. "
"Roz: Hi, Noel. What are you doing here? "
"Noel: I came to bid on my favorite auction item. I should warn you that Lady Luck is on my side tonight. The last guy who rented this tux left a perfectly good comb in the pocket. [points to signing board] May I? "
"Roz: Well, there's no pen. I'm sorry, Noel. "
"Noel: No problem-o. I wear one around my neck. "
"luncheon: "
"Niles: Oh, damn. "
"Frasier: What is it? "
"Niles: It looks like I have some competition for this luncheon. An Alastair Mobery doubled my bid to five hundred dollars. I've heard that name before... "
"Frasier: Yes, it sounds familiar to me too. Wait a minute, isn't he that young, ruthless software tycoon? "
"Niles: Great "
"Frasier: Well, it's no use competing with those deep pockets. But, you know, Niles, this vase here deserves a second look. "
"Niles: Wait a minute. Mobery, wasn't that the nom de plume you used in prep school for your society column? "
"Frasier: What a remarkable coincidence. "
"Niles: Oh, bah You are secretly trying to outbid me. "
"Frasier: Oh, all right. I thought if you were bidding against a stranger you'd only go so high. But if you knew it was me, then your childish competitiveness would kick in. "
"Niles: That is nonsense. Give me the pen. "
"Frasier: No, I'm saving you from yourself. "
"Niles: Give me that. Frasier, in the name of Kelly Ann Grunther and everything she stands for... "
"Frasier: She can't stand "
"Niles: How do you know? "
"Frasier: I asked. "
"Jody: I can't believe I'm bidding this much. "
"Roz: Don't worry, we're gonna have so much fun. "
"Noel: It'll be so great being in that booth together, Roz. No need to get me extra headphones. I'll just share yours [signs again] "
"Auctioneer: We are coming up on the final minute of tonight's auction. No bid will be accepted after the whistle blows. "
"Roz: Listen, Jody, can I talk to you? "
"Jody: I'd love to bid more but I'm really at my limit. "
"Roz: I really want you to win this. I think we hit it off. "
"Jody: Oh, you too, huh? I thought I sensed a little spark between us... Roz. "
"Roz: A spark? "
"Jody: Maybe after the show we could get a drink or have some dinner? "
"Roz: Ah... "
"Roz: You like Italian? "
"Niles: I think it's time to separate the men from the boys. You will never top this bid "
"Frasier: You're right, Niles. I won't top it. I will DOUBLE it "
"Niles: Then I'd like to see the look on your face when I double YOUR bid "
"Frasier: What? You didn't double it, you just added fifty dollars to it "
"Martin: YES "
"Niles: The geniuses are mine "
"Auctioneer: Well, there certainly was some spirited bidding over this luncheon, wasn't there My goodness, four thousand, fifty dollars "
"Niles: What have I done? "
"Frasier: You have let your competitiveness get the better of you, and it serves you right "
"Auctioneer: Due to the overwhelming interest in this luncheon, I propose adding another place at the table. That is, if we can convince our runner-up, Dr. Frasier Crane, to match his brother's generous bid. "
"Auctioneer: What do you say, Dr. Crane? "
"Frasier: Well, all right "
"Frasier: Dear God We've just spent eight thousand dollars for a lunch "
"Niles: Frasier, just try to remember it's for a very worthy cause. "
"Auctioneer: Thanks to the Drs. Crane, there will be a lot fewer homeless cats on the streets of Seattle next year "
"TO: "
"Martin: Hey, Daph. "
"Daphne: Hey. Have a good time at the auction? "
"Martin: Oh yeah, I got a great new "
"barbecue: the Windsor-monic 2000. I wonder if they name it that because that's the one the Royal family uses. "
"Daphne: Oh, I'm sure it is. That's actually the new postage stamp in "
"England: Her Majesty with a pair of barbecue tongs and a sauce brush "
"Frasier: Yes, well at least dad didn't have to go into debt for his purchase. "
"Daphne: Oh yes, Roz told me about your lunch with the geniuses. "
"Frasier: What, Roz beat us back here? "
"Daphne: Yes, she was trying to ditch Noel. Apparently he's not allowed onto the highway with his moped. "
"Niles: Frasier, do you ever wonder why we do all this competition. Where did it even start? "
"Frasier: That's a good question, Niles. Think back. What was the first thing you can remember us competing over? "
"Niles: It'd have to be Mom. We were always jockeying for her time and attention. "
"Frasier: Well, it was a lot more difficult for me, actually - you being her favorite. "
"Niles: What? You were her favorite. "
"Frasier: Oh, don't be ridiculous, Niles. She adored you. Don't you remember the time you lost your tricycle? She actually took mine away from me and gave it to you. "
"Niles: That was for your own good. No eight year old should be riding a tricycle. "
"Frasier: I had a chronic ear infection that affected my balance. "
"Niles: Mom worshiped the ground you walked on. Remember when we brought those bowls home from pottery class? She used yours for the cranberry sauce at Thanksgiving and mine as a dog's dish "
"Frasier: Well, what did you expect her to do? You painted a little dog right on it. "
"Niles: That was a turkey "
"Frasier: Well, isn't this ironic? Both of us thinks the other one is the favorite when in fact neither of us was. "
"Niles: So all our competition was pointless. Oh, I wish we'd talked about this years ago. "
"Frasier: Oh Lord, yes. The angst we could have spared ourselves. Do you remember those IQ tests that we took? "
"Niles: I was sick waiting for the results. "
"Frasier: Which we never found out, of course. Mom refused to tell us anything except that we were two points apart. "
"Niles: I knew you had the higher score. "
"Frasier: I was convinced you did. "
"Niles: Well, mom was certainly right not to tell us. "
"Frasier: Yes, she certainly was. She knew back then that we were both too childish and competitive to handle it. "
"Frasier: You know what would be a sign of real growth, Niles? "
"Niles: To find out those scores right now. "
"Frasier: Exactly. I mean, how often in life can you afford an opportunity to discover really how much you've evolved? "
"Niles: Exactly. "
"Niles: Dad, do you know what our IQs are? "
"Martin: No, but I got a pretty good idea at that auction tonight "
"Frasier: No, Dad. The IQ tests we did when we were children. Would you have saved those? "
"Martin: Oh sure, your mother and I saved all that stuff; report cards, finger paintings, poems. It's in an old Ballantines box in the closet. "
"Frasier: Oh Dad, why don't you just admit it? You're more of a sentimentalist then you let on. "
"Martin: Yes, I guess I am. That's the first case of beer your mother and I ever bought together. "
"Daphne: I still can't get over how much they've spent at that auction. "
"Martin: Oh, they've always tried to one-up each other. "
"Daphne: I suppose all brothers are like that. Mine certainly were. Everything was a contest "
"Daphne: Who could the run the fastest, jump the highest. They even had this strange one where they'd take little brother Michael, put him in a potato sack and see who could roll him the farthest over the frozen lake out back. They loved that game Until that year the spring thaw set in early and poor Michael went right through the ice. Ooh, they caught hell for that one, they did. Caught it worse a week later when Michael's toe finally fell off. Michael cried and cried until they told him to put it under his pillow for the toe fairy And then when he got five quid for it, why it was all they could do to stop him from sawing off the rest of them "
"Martin: What's keeping you guys with that box? "
"Frasier: Here it is, dad. Gosh, this is a virtual treasure trove of memorabilia. "
"Niles: Choir ribbon... Most Improved Badminton... Tap Dance certificate. "
"Martin: I remember going through that box with your mother. She always knew just what to say to cheer me up. 'So what if the trophy says baking instead of baseball, Marty? Catchers' mitts or oven mitts, they're our little champions.' "
"Niles: Oh wait, these are report cards. This might be something. Well here they are. Congratulations, Frasier - 129. "
"Martin: Is that good? "
"Niles: Good? It's practically genius. Bravo, Frasier. "
"Frasier: That's enough, Niles. Now where are you? Higher or lower? "
"Niles: I haven't seen mine yet. I am... higher. "
"Frasier: Well, congratulations. I doff my hat to you, Mr. 131. "
"Niles: Higher "
"Frasier: What do you mean, higher? Mom told us we were two points apart. "
"Niles: Well, apparently Mom was being tactful. "
"Frasier: How tactful? "
"Niles: Well... "
"Frasier: Gimme that "
"Frasier: 156. My God, that's... "
"Niles: Twenty-seven points. "
"Frasier: Yes, I know. "
"Martin: I never should have told you guys about the box. "
"Frasier: No, no, Dad. I'm fine about this. The entire point of this exercise was to prove that Niles and I have moved beyond our competitiveness. And we have. I'm very proud of my kid brother. "
"Niles: Thank you. And I am proud of how mature you are being about all this. In fact, if it were a test for maturity I think your score would be much... "
"Frasier: That's enough, Niles. You know, I suggest we go ahead and call it a night, Niles. We want to be nice and refreshed for our meeting with the three geniuses tomorrow. Oops, or in my case - the four geniuses. "
"Niles: Oh, now you. Good night, Dad. Well, I'll meet you at the restaurant. "
"Frasier: Good night, Niles. "
"Niles: Okay. "
"Frasier: Sleep tight. "
"Frasier: Daphne Is that university library open all night? "
"Daphne: I think so, why do you ask? "
"Frasier: Oh, for God's sake. Do you think I'm going to let my little brother humiliate me tomorrow? "
"Martin: What are you talking about? "
"Frasier: Dad, he is smarter than I am. Niles will be sitting there rambling on to the geniuses about the cosmos, black holes, matter, antimatter, and I won't matter at all. [enters to the kitchen] I'm going to have to make myself a nice thermos full of coffee and get down to that library. [starts with coffee pot] "
"Martin: Oh Frasier, what do you think you're gonna learn in one night? "
"Frasier: Just enough to ask some informed questions, Dad. I may not have a 156 IQ, but I'm a quick study. Daphne, is there something wrong with this coffee pot? "
"Daphne: You have to plug it in "
"Frasier: Well there, you won't have to tell me that again "
"Frasier: Hello, Niles. "
"Niles: Frasier. Sleep well last night? "
"Frasier: Oh yes, like a baby "
"Niles: Like a baby with library privileges. I know what you did. "
"Frasier: How? "
"Niles: The way you rushed me out of there last night, I sensed something was up. So I waited in my car and sure enough, ten minutes later you tore out of the garage. "
"Frasier: Niles, I'm so sorry. It's just that... "
"Niles: No, no, no, I don't want to hear any more of your facile excuses. "
"Frasier: Good Lord, gesundheit "
"Niles: I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I think your competitiveness has sunk to a new low. I'm ashamed of you. "
"Frasier: I'm terribly sorry. It's just that I'm so insecure about even coming to this luncheon at all. "
"Frasier: You just scratched your ear. You were at the library too "
"Niles: I was most certainly was not. "
"Frasier: The only thing that makes you sneeze and scratch your ear is your parchment mite allergy. So, that was you sneezing from behind the stacks all night. "
"Niles: I had to go. I knew you'd be racing through those scientific journals faster than a proton in a particle accelerator. "
"Frasier: Oh, stop showing off. You know, speaking of accelerating particles, why don't you do something about that sneezing? "
"Niles: Well, I took some of these before, but they're obviously not as strong as I thought they were. I'm going to take a couple more. "
"Frasier: Niles, why don't you just go home and go to bed? "
"Niles: Well, that is exactly what you'd like for me to be happening. "
"Frasier: What did you just say? "
"Niles: Well, if you didn't repeat it the first time, I'm not gonna listen to it. "
"Frasier: That medication is affecting your speech, you've just taken a second dose of it. For God's sake, you're going to make a fool out of yourself. "
"Niles: Well, you should talk Look at your shaky hands and your twitching eyes. You were up all night drinking coffee all night last night, weren't you? "
"Frasier: I am not twitching, you will not psych me into twitching "
"Waiter: Gentlemen, may I offer you... Sir, is your eye bothering you? "
"Frasier: No, it's fine "
"Waiter: Can I get you something to drink? "
"Frasier: Yes, some coffee. Decaf "
"Niles: I'd like a cup of... tea, sounds nice. "
"Frasier: Niles, you know what, you should leave. You're embarrassing yourself, for God's sakes "
"Niles: I'm never leaving while you're still not leaving. You know you had the good bed. "
"Frasier: Well, now you're just hallucinating. "
"Niles: When we moved to Wallace Lane and we shared a room and you got to pick where you would be to having your... sleeping. "
"Frasier: Niles, the beds were identical. Oh, why am I even bothering, explaining this to a man who has his elbow in the butter "
"Niles: hallucinationing now? "
"Frasier: Niles, have you taken these pills before? "
"Niles: No, but they've fixed my nose. I just wish they wouldn't make me so hyper. "
"Frasier: For God's sake, you've spilled water all over me, you jackass. Just give me another napkin. "
"Niles: Ooh, Napkin, hello, napkin "
"Frasier: Niles, wake up, wake up "
"Zafrin: Excuse me? "
"Frasier: Oh, Dr. Zafrin. Goodness, this is quite an honour. "
"Frasier: Allow me to introduce Dr. Niles Crane. "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Oh, hello Niles, I'm surprised to see you up so soon. Are you all right? "
"Niles: I feel, uh, not bad. A little dry. When I blink it makes a scratching noise. "
"Frasier: Let me get you a little water, here. "
"Niles: Thank you. Well, how long did we last the lunch? "
"Frasier: Well, not too long. Nine thousand dollars doesn't buy the leisurely lunch it used to. "
"Niles: Wait a minute, I thought it was eight thousand. "
"Frasier: No, no, you knocked over the aquarium on the way out. You know, whenever I feel envy about your IQ again, I'll just conjure up the image of you sprawled out on the bed of live koi - weeping and desperately trying to revive that little plastic diver. "
"Niles: Oh, dear. "
"Martin: All right, Niles? Hurry up with those patties, I got five more pounds in the fridge. "
"Frasier: Right, Dad. Dad's having his poker chums over to give him a hand with the barbecue. You can give me a hand here. "
"Niles: When's it going to end, Frasier - all this obsessive competitiveness? "
"Frasier: Probably never, Niles. Whether it started with seeking Mom's approval or some other insecurity, we're locked in a pattern now that we'll probably never get out of. "
"Niles: That sounds bleak. "
"Frasier: No, no, not necessarily. There have been some benefits to it. I probably wouldn't have done so well at school if it hadn't had been for my fear that I'd be bested by my brainy little brother. "
"Niles: Well, I was certainly spurred on by your success as well. Why else would I have joined the chess club and the drama club and the key club? And what other possible reason would there be for spending an entire summer training a seeing-eye dog? Aside from helping the blind. "
"Frasier: You know what, I might not have pushed myself on to Harvard and Oxford. "
"Niles: Well, I might not have been led to psychiatry, which has been the saving grace of my life. "
"Frasier: You see, Niles, frankly we both have a lot to thank each other for. We've come a long way from those two little boys just starving for a parent's approval. "
"Martin: How are they coming? "
"Frasier: Oh, just great, Dad. We're going as fast as we can. Here you are. "
"Martin: Nice job on those patties. "
"Frasier: Thank you. "
"Niles: You really think so? "
"Martin: Yeah, not too thick, not too thin, tight enough to hold their shape. Perfect "
"Frasier: Thank you, Dad. "
"Niles: Just wait until you see the next batch. "
"Frasier: Yeah "
"Niles: I'm surprised you let him keep that out there. "
"Frasier: Oh well, it's a bit of an eyesore, and frankly kind of a fire hazard. But what the hell? It makes him happy. "
"Niles: You lodged an anonymous complaint with the building, didn't you? "
"Frasier: It'll be gone by Thursday. "

"Frasier: Hello, Niles. "
"Niles: Frasier, was that the author Dr. Gordon Edelstein? "
"Frasier: Yes. "
"Niles: I wasn't aware you knew him "
"Frasier: Yes, well, we just met. You see, the station is hiring another call-in psychiatrist for a one-week trial period, and they've asked me to choose among the finalists. "
"Niles: Well, he'd be wonderful I just finished his book on the victims of obsessive-compulsive disorder. [wiping down his chair] Poor, tic-ridden devils "
"Frasier: Niles, before you take out your utensil chamois, I've got to tell you I have another interview in just a few minutes, all right? Though it's going to be tough to top Dr. Edelstein. "
"Niles: I must say, you're taking this rather well. "
"Frasier: What do you mean. "
"Niles: Many people in your position would feel threatened at the thought of... well, another cat sharing the litter-box. "
"Frasier: Your flattering analogy aside, Niles, I take it as a tribute. Obviously, the station is so pleased with my show that they're looking for more of the same. They could hardly ask me to do another three hours. Imagine how exhausting that would be. "
"Niles: And for you as well. Anyway, moving on to me, what's the verdict? "
"Frasier: Verdict? "
"Niles: On my new look. I must say, you deserve some of the credit. "
"Frasier: Really? "
"Niles: Well, yes, you keep saying I should accept Daphne's relationship with Donny and find a paramour of my own. Well, the hunt is on I thought to bolster my self-esteem I would adopt this raffish new look "
"Frasier: Well, it suits you. Dashing, and yet understated, and, uh... oh, I give up, what are we talking about? "
"Niles: My mustache. I grant you, it's at an early stage. "
"Frasier: What stage, Research & Development? "
"Nora: Dr. Crane? Dr. Nora Fairchild. "
"Frasier: Oh yes, of course. Welcome. "
"Nora: I can't tell you what a privilege this is. I listened to your show today, and I was amazed I hope that doesn't sound too fawning. "
"Frasier: Oh, fawning is just fine. Fawning is fun "
"Nora: I hope I'm not interrupting another interview? "
"Frasier: No, no, this is my brother, Niles Crane. He was just about to leave. "
"Nora: I should have known you two were brothers. The same superb fashion sense, the same refined yet masculine good looks. You must be so proud of your kid brother, the radio star. "
"Niles: Well, yes. Congratulations on your new job, I hope you'll be very happy at KACL. "
"Nora: Isn't that a bit premature? "
"Niles: Oh well, let's just say I know my little brother. "
"TO: "
"Nora: I want to thank you both for making me and my producer feel so welcome. Is everyone around here as friendly as you two? "
"Frasier: Well... "
"Roz: Well, hello there "
"Frasier: Some are even friendlier. This is my producer, Roz Doyle. "
"Nora: Dr. Nora, and this is my producer, George. "
"Roz: Nice to meet you. "
"George: Hello. "
"Roz: Follow me and I'll give you the lay of the land. "
"Frasier: Let's just hope that's a figure of speech, not a sales pitch. Well, Nora, please, please, do come in, make yourself at home. Here we are, get settled in. Here's your headset, of course the phone lines, everything's pretty self-explanatory, cough button, on-air button. Listen, I want you to remember it's all right to be nervous. Even my first show was a tad bumpy. "
"Kenny: 'Bumpy?' It was a train wreck 'Medic, we got incoming' "
"Frasier: Yes, thank you, Kenny. As I recall, you weren't even here then. "
"Kenny: Oh, I got a tape of it from my Secret Santa. Break a leg, Dr. Nora. "
"Nora: Thank you. "
"Frasier: I'll get out of your hair. Godspeed, Dr. Nora. "
"Roz: What are you smirking about? "
"Frasier: Oh, gosh, it's just so much fun to have a protégé. You see the way she behaves towards me? It's like a shy Japanese novice bowing before her Frasier sensei "
"Roz: I feel a bow coming on myself. Could you pass me that wastebasket? "
"Frasier: Stop it Shh, she's about to start. I just want to catch the beginning, make sure she's got those first-show jitters under control. "
"Nora: All right, let's get right to our first caller. Whom do we have? "
"George: We have Jenny from Tacoma on line one. "
"Nora: Hello, Jenny, I'm Dr. Nora and I'm here to help. "
"Jenny: Hi, Dr. Nora. My boyfriend and I have been living together for about two years— "
"Nora: Are you having sex? "
"Jenny: Our sex life's not the problem, it's great. But whenever I mention marriage he changes the subject. Do you think that he's afraid of commitment? "
"Nora: No, that's it. Let me help you see this from a different perspective. "
"Nora: You're a whore, Jenny. "
"Jenny: Huh? A-a whore? "
"Nora: You're sleeping with a man you're not married to. In my book, that's a whore. "
"Jenny: I-I'm not a whore I'm a flight attendant "
"Nora: Oh, you think there's no overlap? "
"Roz: Well, she's got her jitters under control "
"booth: "
"Nora: Wake up, Jenny, you've blown it Dump this creep Find a new guy, and until you're Mrs. New Guy you keep those knees together, OK? Staple them I don't care if you have to hop to the altar God bless, honey. Who's next? "
"TO: "
"Niles: Hello, Daphne. "
"Daphne: Hello. "
"Niles: Notice anything? "
"Daphne: Oh yes, don't you look dashing Blue really is your color. Hold still, though, there's something on your lip. Oh, wait, it's some sort of hair. "
"Niles: Actually, it's a mustache. "
"Daphne: Oh yes, so it is. Still a bit on the wispy side. Yeah, puts me in mind of my Grammy Moon. Or rather it will, once it's grown in a bit. "
"Frasier: Turn on the radio. "
"Martin: Something the matter? "
"Frasier: Just turn the radio on to KACL, please. "
"Nora: Listen to me, you have a child You think you have the right to get divorced just because you're tired of your husband? "
"Jill: But he's gay "
"Nora: You picked him. You made a baby with him. Maybe you got him drunk, maybe you dressed up as Antonio Banderas, I don't care Just make it work "
"Niles: Well, that's a bit harsh "
"Frasier: Oh, please. This is a woman who believes the Spanish Inquisition was just tough love for heretics "
"Martin: You know, we were listening to her while I was doing my exercises, and I don't think she's so bad. "
"Frasier: Excuse me? "
"Martin: Well, it's nice to have someone stand up for old-fashioned values. Like sex. I mean, I'm no prude, but in my day sex was still something sacred, and mysterious. Nowadays, you can't even turn on the television without seeing all this 'Ooh-ooh, Ah-ah' stuff "
"Frasier: Well, I think that explains our ninety dollar cable bill this month "
"Daphne: I liked her too. She reminds me of my old mum. She'll point out every little flaw you've got, remind you of every mistake you ever made, tell you you're lazy, you'll never amount to anything, and no good man will ever have you. But, it's just because she loves you In fact, I think I'll give old Mum a call "
"Martin: You know, if you hate her so much, why did you hire her? "
"Frasier: Well, I didn't know she was going to behave this way She said all the right things at the interview. "
"Niles: Ho-ho, she certainly did She complimented his clothes, his looks, she even pretended to believe I was the older brother. Of course, the mustache may have clouded her judgment on that. "
"Martin: She has a mustache? "
"Frasier: Well, like it or not, I am responsible for her being here. I'll just have to have a talk with her. Tell her to soften her approach a bit before she alienates her entire audience. I mean, really, people can tell the difference between constructive criticism and outright abuse "
"Daphne: No, Mum, my boyfriend hasn't dumped me for someone prettier and smarter yet She's such an old tease. "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Until tomorrow, then, this is Dr. Frasier Crane. "
"Frasier: Ah, Dr. Nora. "
"Nora: Such a frosty tone. Is something the matter? "
"Frasier: I have just one question— "
"Roz: What kind of vicious, judgmental, name-calling, machete- mouthed bitch are you? "
"Frasier: I was going for the less feisty version. "
"Roz: I heard what you said to that single mother yesterday. For your information, I happen to be a single mom too. "
"Nora: That doesn't surprise me after watching you pounce on poor George like a Kodiak bear on a salmon. "
"Roz: That does it... "
"Frasier: Roz, Roz, stop it I have to talk to Dr. Nora before her show. Now, just pencil the hair-pulling for later, all right? "
"Roz: All right. But this isn't over between us. If you want, I'll take this out on the street. "
"Nora: That would hardly be fair. You'd have the home field advantage. "
"Frasier: Well, I don't even know where to begin. "
"Nora: Save it. Whatever it is, I've already heard it. 'Dr. Nora is mean, Dr. Nora hurts people's feelings.' Well, too bad. I'm not here to coddle people, I'm here to help them. "
"Frasier: Oh, really? And just how were you helping that poor, confused bisexual woman by calling her an 'equal-opportunity slut?' You know, the worst thing about this is how you misrepresented yourself to get this job. "
"Nora: You're hardly one to question my ethics. We both know you hired me because you hoped I might sleep with you. "
"Frasier: That thought never occurred to me "
"Nora: Now who's lying? You won't admit that, like most men, you leave all major decisions to your penis. Fortunately for Seattle, your penis chose right. It just didn't know why. "
"Frasier: Yes, well, you're just forgetting one thing, Dr. Nora. You are here on my recommendation, you may consider it withdrawn. "
"Kenny: Hey, Dr. Crane. "
"Frasier: Ah, Kenny, just the man I wanted to see. "
"Kenny: Dr. Nora — don't hit me "
"Frasier: I want to talk to you about Dr. Nora's show. "
"Kenny: Yeah, well, get in line. The switchboards were going nuts. "
"Frasier: I don't doubt it. "
"Kenny: They love you "
"Frasier: Excuse me? "
"Kenny: Well, except for the ones that hate you. But either way, they're listening. So you consider that option picked up. "
"George: Ten seconds. "
"Nora: Thank you, Kenny. Now get out of my booth. "
"Kenny: Yes, ma'am. "
"Frasier: Kenny, you can't be serious about hiring that woman full-time Putting that woman behind a microphone is like putting Typhoid Mary in a kissing booth "
"Kenny: I'm sorry, Doc. Ratings are ratings. "
"booth: "
"Tom: Hi, Dr. Nora, my name is Tom, and I have this co-worker who's really driving me up the wall. What can I do about it? "
"Nora: Not a thing, Tom. Not one damn thing. "
"Denise: Nothing I ever do is good enough for her. I baked a cake for her birthday, and she said it tasted like sawdust. I know she's my mother, but sometimes I just want to shut her out of my life. "
"Frasier: Oh, Denise, burning bridges solves nothing. I'd like to suggest that you seek family counseling to help you and your mother get to the root of some of these issues, provided your mother's willing to cooperate. If not, perhaps individual counseling would help. Will you stay on the line so Roz can give you some numbers? "
"Denise: O.K. Thank you, Dr. Crane. "
"Frasier: It's my pleasure. [looks over his shoulder and sees Nora's sour look] Well, I see through the glass that Dr. Nora either disagrees with me or has just eaten a bad clam. I'm sure she'll tell us which when the Dr. Nora show begins right after this traffic report from Chopper Dave. "
"Roz: O.K., Denise, I've got some numbers for you. Do you have a pen? "
"Frasier: Come on, Roz, hurry up. I'd like to get out of here before her trainer shows up with a bucket of live mice for her pre- show feeding. "
"Nora: I'm sorry to cut you off, Chopper Dave, but we have a therapy emergency. Denise, are you still on? "
"Denise: Yes. "
"Frasier: That's my caller "
"Nora: Denise, I want you to ignore everything Dr. Crane just told you. I know a lot more about mothers that he does, and here is Fact #1"
": they don't change. Cut this woman out of your life. "
"Frasier: I don't believe this "
"Denise: You don't think that with counseling— "
"Nora: Denise, when you have a tumor, what do you do? Do you sit it down and say, 'Hey, tumor, let's get along, O.K.?' No, you take a knife and cut it out Well, Denise, your mother is a tumor. My heart bleeds for you, because I have been there, and I know how hard it is to look at your own mother's face and say, 'Bye-bye, you toxic harpy You are not hurting me again' But that is what you have to do. "
"Denise: I think maybe you're right. "
"Nora: I'm always right. And you know what else? I bet your cake was yummy. God bless, honey. Who's next? "
"George: We have Frasier, from here. "
"Frasier: How dare you ambush Denise that way? "
"Nora: Oh well, what a surprise. I dare to give one of Frasier's callers a second opinion, and what does Frasier say? "
"Frasier: Ah, yes, sound effects The therapist's best friend You realize what you're doing is completely unprofessional? Denise called my show, she didn't ask for your opinion "
"Nora: And I didn't ask for yours. Back to you, Chopper Dave. "
"Frasier: She cut me off All right, let's just settle this. We don't like each other. But we're going to have to coexist here. So why don't we agree that I won't criticize you, and you won't criticize me. Do we have a deal? "
"Nora: No. "
"Frasier: No? "
"Nora: No, I will undermine you every chance I get, because you, Dr. Crane, are a dangerous man "
"Frasier: I'm dangerous? "
"Nora: Yes. Seattle's Great Enabler. You tell tramps and fornicators that their problem is low self-esteem. They should have low self-esteem, they're going to hell "
"Frasier: I take it back You're not unprofessional — you're a freaking loon "
"George: Five seconds. "
"Frasier: All right, if it's war you two want, it's war you'll get Right, Roz? "
"Roz: You don't actually buy all this 'no sex' stuff of hers, do you? "
"George: Yeah. "
"Roz: Well, it's WAR "
"TO: "
"Martin: Oh hi, Niles. "
"Niles: Hey, Dad. You probably noticed I shaved my mustache. "
"Niles: I decided a better way to change my look was to pump some iron. "
"Martin: Ah. So what, you joined a gym? "
"Niles: I certainly did. I start the minute my weight belt gets back from the monogrammer's. "
"Niles: Oh, Frasier, you free for dinner? "
"Frasier: Well, I suppose so, yes. "
"Daphne: Hey, look who I bumped into in the elevator. "
"Frasier: Roz "
"Roz: I've been on the phone all day, digging up dirt on Dr. Nora, and you will not believe what I found "
"Frasier: Really? "
"Roz: I called the station where she used to work, and they couldn't wait to dish her For starters, she has no medical degree. "
"Frasier: What? "
"Roz: Her doctorate is in Physical Education "
"Frasier: She's a GYM TEACHER "
"Niles: Wouldn't want to be the chubby kid in that gym class. "
"Martin: Or the boy in the monogrammed weight belt. "
"Frasier: Well, this is just dynamite, Roz "
"Roz: Oh, that's not even half of it. Her name isn't Fairchild, she was born Mulhern, and Little Miss Family Values has two divorces behind her, and an affair with a married man "
"Frasier: Tomorrow, I am going to drop this little bombshell to start my show, and end hers "
"Martin: You know, Fras, when I was on the force, I went through a feud like this with Charlie Drucker, and believe me it's not worth it. I started out by making a joke about his chest. "
"Daphne: His chest? "
"Martin: Yeah, he was like a heavyset guy, and he had those, you know, 'man-bosoms.' So, he heard about it, and he got mad at me, and he wrote something about me on the men's room wall, and I should have just called it quits right there and then. But his name being 'Drucker' brought out the poet in me. Then it just got worse and worse, and we both ended up looking like idiots. "
"Frasier: Well, Dad, I don't intend to get into a feud with her. I just want to get her off the air. "
"Niles: Yeah, but if you attack her like that, aren't you just descending to her level? "
"Frasier: You know, Roz, maybe they're right. I mean, look at what this woman has reduced me to already. Trading barbs, yelling over the air. Now I'm spreading rumors about her? Is that anyway for a psychiatrist to deal with conflict? "
"Roz: Don't you wimp out on me "
"Frasier: Now, Roz, just think about it. There may be a better way. You know, Dr. Nora is clearly a damaged and angry woman. Maybe I could find out what's at the root of that anger, and help her, also proving that my method of therapy is the more valid one. "
"Roz: Why are you doing this to me? Look, if you have a tumor— "
"Frasier: Roz, stop it "
"Niles: You know, if you want to analyze her, you might start with that whole mother thing. I caught her show yesterday, and that certainly seemed to be a hot-button issue. "
"Frasier: Yes, it did, didn't it? They've been estranged for years. You know, perhaps we could find the woman and discover what caused this rift between them. "
"Niles: Maybe even effect a reconciliation. "
"Frasier: Of course, it won't be easy. We don't even know if the woman's still alive. "
"Daphne: Yes, all sorts of things could happen to a woman her age. Her mother could have had a heart attack, or a stroke. "
"Frasier: Exactly. "
"Daphne: She could be hit by a bus as she's coming out of the pub. Or fall asleep smoking a cigarette and be burned to a crisp right there in her smelly bed Or she could fall off a ferry and be pulled down under the water, the roar of the waves drowning out her cries for help, until no one could hear that shrill voice of hers, not ever again Well, I'm all done with my darks. "
"TO: "
"Nora: Listen to me You should be shunning this woman, not rewarding her with gifts A baby shower for an unwed mother? Now I've heard it all. Who's next? "
"Frasier: Roz, did her mother get here all right? "
"Roz: Yes, but I'm begging you We could drive a stake through that thing's heart right now "
"Frasier: Roz, Roz, please trust me, my way is better. Get in here. "
"Frasier: Ah, Mrs. Mulhern. I'm Dr. Frasier Crane, it's such a pleasure to meet you. "
"Mulhern: Oh, Dr. Crane, I can't thank you enough for finding me and bringing me here. "
"Frasier: Well, I was so moved by your story. It's a joy to do this for you. "
"Mulhern: For twenty years I wondered where my little girl was, and if I'd ever see her again. "
"Roz: What did you two fight about to begin with? "
"Mulhern: Oh, I blame myself. I thought the man she wanted to marry wasn't good enough for her, so she eloped. And I've been so afraid the emphysema would finish me before I could ask her forgiveness and tell her I love her. "
"Frasier: Well, tell her you shall. Roz? "
"phone: "
"Nora: Forget couples' therapy, Allison. He is a loser If you don't drop him right now, you deserve every bit of misery you get God bless, honey. Who's next? "
"George: We have Frasier Crane on line one. "
"Nora: Frasier, you want to yell at me for that last call? "
"Frasier: No, although I do believe that a gifted therapist can help two people put aside their anger and heal the differences between them. "
"Nora: Blah, blah, blah. "
"Frasier: I have someone here with me today, someone you haven't seen for quite a while. There's something she'd like to tell you, something she's wanted to tell you for a very, very long time. "
"say: "
"Frasier: Mrs. Mulhern? "
"Mulhern: You little whore "
"Nora: MOTHER "
"Mulhern: So, you thought you could get away from me, did you? Thought you could leave me to rot in that dump without barely enough cash for a bottle of Mateus You'll pay for that, missy "
"Roz: I was wrong, Frasier Your way IS better "
"Frasier: Mrs. Mulhern— "
"Mulhern: Keep out of this "
"Nora: M-Mother, please I am doing my show "
"Mulhern: Yes, you're Little Miss Perfect now, aren't you? Telling everybody else how wicked they are They should hear about your past "
"Frasier: Mrs. Mulhern, please "
"Mulhern: The shame you brought on me, you ungrateful tramp "
"Nora: Mother, please, I'm a good girl now. "

"Mulhern: What are they paying you here? I want my cut "
"Nora: I knew that you hated me, but I just can't believe you could be so cruel "
"Frasier: I was trying to help She seemed delightful on the phone "
"Mulhern: I want fifty dollars right now "

"Martin: You know what I could go for? Some fried eggs and bacon. "
"Daphne: Here's your bran flakes. "
"Martin: Oh, fine ' and slamming it down on a plate that "
"Daphne: Don't give him any toast "
"Martin: I'm not "
"Martin: Sports. And recycling. "
"Daphne: Yes, we see you, Eddie - 8"
":00 on the dot. "
"Martin: Well, he's a dog, what do you expect? He's a creature of habit. "
"Frasier: Good morning, all. [they ad-lib hellos, he heads into the kitchen] Say, Dad. You remember that woman I went out with on Valentine's Day but I wasn't quite sure if it was a romantic thing? "
"Martin: Yeah, that new publicity woman at the station. "
"Frasier: Yes, Cassandra Stone. Well, I asked her out again last night and I got my answer. "
"Martin: Oh, I'm sorry, Fras'. "
"Frasier: No, I'm not finished "
"Martin: That's the spirit. You hang in there. "
"Daphne: You know, Dr. Crane, someone once said that long periods of abstinence can actually refresh the soul. "
"Cassandra: Morning, everyone "
"Frasier: Yes, well that someone was me and I was full of it Everyone, this is Cassandra. "
"Cassandra: You must be Frasier's dad. I've heard all about you. "
"Martin: Marty Crane. "
"Cassandra: Nice to meet you "
"Martin: Well, nice to meet YOU too "
"Cassandra: You are so cute Now I see where Frasier got those gorgeous eyes. "
"Frasier: Enough. This is Daphne Moon - my father's home health care worker. "
"Cassandra: Hello. "
"Martin: Are you going to join us for breakfast, Cassandra? "
"Cassandra: Oh, I could go for an English muffin. "
"Frasier: Well, perhaps our own English muffin could fetch that for you. "
"Frasier: Or I could get it- "
"Cassandra: No, I'll get it myself. "
"Martin: Way to go, Fras, I like her "
"Daphne: Gee, I wonder why. 'Now I see where Frasier gets those gorgeous eyes.' "
"Frasier: Niles. "
"Niles: Hurry up and get dressed Frasier, we'll lose our court. I must warn you I may be unbeatable today. Our squash pro, Octavio, taught me a backhand slice that could shave the bristles off a kiwi fruit. "
"Frasier: Well Niles, I'm afraid we may have to reschedule today. You see, I... had a date last night. "
"Niles: Oh, I'm sorry Hey, but there's no sense moping around. A brisk game of squash would be the best thing for you - I can't think of a better way to lift your spirits. "
"Cassandra: Good morning. "
"Frasier: Keep thinking. "
"Frasier: I tell you, Roz, the entire evening was pure magic. "
"Roz: Well, I'm happy for you. You have been in a dry spell, haven't you? "
"Frasier: Oh no, Roz, that was just the calm before the storm. I assure you, we are in the midst of a full-blown love hurricane. "
"Roz: You were so much easier to be around when you were horny and pathetic. "
"Frasier: Oh, sorry Roz, I have been monopolizing the conversation. So what's going on with you? "
"Roz: Well, actually it has been a really exciting week. Of course Alice's first birthday party is this Sunday and we're having twelve of her little friends over. She loves bears, so the whole party's going to be this bear theme - party favours, bear cake; I'm going to dress up like a bear, I think, and do a little bear dance... "
"Roz: So, that's really great about you and Cassandra "
"Frasier: Yes, we're really hitting it off, I think... "
"Faye: Frasier? "
"Frasier: Faye. "
"Faye: Hi. "
"Frasier: Oh my God, wow. Hi, it's been a while. Gosh, Faye Moskowitz, this is my producer, Roz Doyle. So what have you been up to? "
"Faye: Well, I just got back from Paris. "
"Frasier: Really? I didn't even know you'd gone. "
"Faye: You didn't get my message? "
"Roz: Oh Frasier, before I "
"forget: Faye called - she's going to France for a month. I'm sorry. "
"Faye: Well, it's great to see you. We should get together for coffee sometime. "
"Frasier: I'd love to. "
"Roz: Well I'm on my way out, why don't you take my seat? "
"Faye: Uh, thanks. If that's all right with you? "
"Frasier: Of course. "
"Faye: Great, well I'll put some money into my meter. "
"Frasier: What are you doing? I can't have coffee with her. "
"Roz: Why not? Obviously she's still interested. "
"Frasier: I'm seeing Cassandra, for God's sakes. I can't date two people at once. "
"Roz: It doesn't have to be on the same night. Although if you're good at faking a headache and you don't mind getting changed in the car... "
"Frasier: Roz "
"Roz: Well, did you tell Cassandra you were going to be exclusive to her? "
"Frasier: No... "
"Roz: So, then you're just dating. Relax, it's supposed to be fun. Just see where it takes you. "
"Frasier: Well, that sort of lifestyle is all right for some people, but not for me. I'm a one-woman man... if that "
"Roz: Okay, suit yourself - keep it platonic. "
"Frasier: Well, that's easy for you to say. How do you tell somebody that you're attracted to them but you just can't sleep with them? "
"Roz: I guess you just say... you just say... I'll ask around. "
"TO: "
"Martin: You know what I feel like this morning? Some French toast and sausage patties. "
"Daphne: Here's your bran flakes. "
"Martin: Oh, fine. "
"shouts: "
"Daphne: You're not giving him any toast, are you? "
"Martin: Of course not. "
"Frasier: Oh, good morning. "
"Daphne: Morning. "
"Martin: I didn't hear you come in last night. You have a date? "
"Daphne: Well, I guess that answers that. "
"Martin: Well, ease up there, Cassandra's a great gal - women like her don't come along every day. "
"Faye: Morning. "
"Daphne: No, they certainly don't "
"Frasier: Dad, Daphne, you remember Faye. "
"Faye: Hi Martin, it's good to see you again. "
"Martin: Yeah, likewise. "
"Faye: And Daphne, you look gorgeous. Did you get your hair cut since the last time I saw you? "
"Daphne: Well, yes I did. Can I fix you some breakfast? "
"Faye: I have really got to run. I'm running late and I still have to call my friend at the museum to get tickets for that Seurat exhibit. I just hope it's not sold out. "
"Frasier: Well if it "
"is: Que Seurat, Seurat. "
"Faye: That was funnier the first time "
"Frasier: Yeah. "
"Martin: What happened to Cassandra? "
"Daphne: Obviously he dumped her for someone better. "
"Frasier: I haven't dumped anyone. "
"Daphne: What, you mean you're dating both of them? "
"Frasier: No, I didn't intend to. It's just that - well, I ran into Faye yesterday and I was about to tell her about Cassandra. It's just that we were enjoying our coffee so much that coffee turned into dinner, and then dinner turned into drinks, and then drinks turned into, well... coffee again "
"Frasier: Damn I completely forgot I rescheduled squash with Niles. Don't be angry at me for still being in my robe. "
"Cassandra: I won't, I wish I were in mine "
"Frasier: Cassandra. What a surprise. "
"Cassandra: I brought you some pastries. "
"Frasier: Oh, isn't that thoughtful of you. "
"Cassandra: Hi Martin, Dixie. "
"Frasier: Cassandra You know, I'd love it if you could stay; It's just that I've got to go and pick up my brother for a game of squash. "
"Niles: Morning, all. "
"Frasier: Well, isn't that a timesaver You know, I've still got to go get dressed anyway, and I'll just see you back at the station? "
"Cassandra: Okay, alright, have a good day. Oh, you know, I'll just use the powder room. "
"Frasier: This is a disaster "
"Niles: What is? "
"Faye: Hi, Niles. "
"Niles: Oh, I'm up to speed "
"Frasier: Morning. "
"Faye: Well, I guess I'll just be... "
"Faye: What? "
"Frasier: Uh, we just noticed there's a nest of baby hummingbirds on the balcony. And we're just keeping our voices down. You run along. "
"Faye: Hummingbirds made it to the 19th floor? "
"Frasier: Yes, well they're-they're Himalayan mountain hummers. "
"Faye: Uh huh. "
"Frasier: Very rare. Bye bye. "
"Faye: Okay, I'll see you later, Frasier. "
"Cassandra: What are you doing? "
"Frasier: I was just standing guard. The door is... lock's broken and sometimes Dad just wanders in. "
"Cassandra: Well, I know you've got your game so I'll just get out of your hair. "
"Frasier: Right. "
"Cassandra: Goodbye, everyone. "
"Frasier: Aren't I going to get a hug first? "
"Cassandra: Of course. "
"Cassandra: Are you alright? "
"Frasier: Oh yes, it's just so hard to say goodbye to you. "
"Frasier: Well, time's a wasting, off you go, bye-bye "
"Niles: Got anymore hiding in the grotto, Hef? "
"Frasier: Oh, for God's sakes... oh, I'm just not up to this sort of thing - what made me think I could juggle? "
"Martin: I sure as hell don't know - you couldn't catch a balloon 'til you were ten. "
"Frasier: Yes, thank you, Dad You see, my problem is that each of them appeals to different sides of my personality. Faye is artistic and cerebral and cultured, and Cassandra is passionate and fun and spontaneous. "
"Martin: Well, my vote sure goes for Cassandra. "
"Daphne: Oh, you would say that. Any young woman who shows you any attention, you're ready to sign over your pension check I think he should go for Faye. "
"Martin: Oh, Faye, Faye - if he wants some boring, artsy-fartsy conversation, he's got Niles "
"ice: "
"Frasier: Yes, well my point is that I'm really torn here. I feel as if I honestly cannot choose. "
"Niles: I think I might be able to help you with this. [takes out a quarter] Heads, it's Faye; Tails, Cassandra. "
"Daphne: Oh, this is the sort of thing that makes a woman feel really special "
"Frasier: Niles, you're actually going to flip a coin? The decision cannot be made that simply. "
"Martin: Well, it's not going to be that simple. The chances of Niles catching that quarter are about the same as you... "
"Frasier: Enough, Dad "
"Niles: Just go with me on this, Frasier. Heads, it's Faye; tails, Cassandra. "
"Niles: And the winner is... Admit it You want me to say one name more than the other. "
"Frasier: Niles, you're right, I do - Cassandra. "
"Daphne: Yes/Oh "
"Niles: There you have it. "
"Frasier: Thank you, thank you, Niles. Wow, what a relief. You know, my life was perfectly happy before Faye came back, you know? Yes, yes, it's Cassandra - she's the one. Next time I see Faye I'll just have to tell her it's over. Oh gosh, Niles, I'm sorry - I'm afraid we've lost our court again. Do you mind if we reschedule it just once more? "
"Niles: All right, that's fine. "
"Martin: I've got to hand it to you, Frasier. You had a tough decision to make, but you made it. Heck, I can't even decide whether to have the strawberry or the grape jelly. "
"Niles: Well, Dad, I stil have my trusty quarter. Let's say heads, grape; tails, strawberry. "
"Martin: You've got to wonder what goes on, on that squash court. "
"Time: 11"
":30) "
"Martin: You know what I could go for this morning? A big old Spanish omelet. "
"Daphne: Here's your bran flakes. "
"Martin: What's that? "
"Daphne: Your yellow bowl broke in the dishwasher. "
"Martin: Well, don't you have another one? "
"Daphne: Afraid not. "
"Martin: Well - red, yellow - what difference does it make? "
"Martin: No, I don't like this red bowl - it's thrown everything off "
"Daphne: You know, I think we do have another yellow bowl. Why don't you go and sit down and I'll fetch it for you. "
"Martin: Okay. "
"Daphne: Back off, I need this "
"Frasier: Oh, morning, Dad. "
"Martin: Everything go alright with Faye last night? She didn't take the breakup too hard, did she? "
"Frasier: Not really. "
"Martin: Well, I'm sure she realizes, pretty as she is, that she won't be alone for long. "
"Faye: Good morning, Martin. "
"Martin: What'd I tell you? Hi, how you doing? I'll get this. "
"Faye: I had an incredible time last night. "
"Frasier: Me too. "
"Niles: Morning, all Oh, forget it. "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Niles. "
"Niles: Frasier. "
"Frasier: Glad you're here. Look, I'm so sorry about this morning. "
"Niles: Oh, oh, oh, not at all, I ended up playing an exhilarating game with Chip Emery. "
"Frasier: Oh. "
"Niles: I won two out of three sets, and if you recall, Chip was club champion four years running. "
"Frasier: Yes, and I also recall that that record comes with an "
"asterisk: I believe his streak was interrupted by World War Two. "
"Niles: It was Korea and you know it "
"Frasier: Can I have my usual, please? "
"Niles: So why was Faye at your apartment this morning? "
"Frasier: Well, actually I almost made a terrible mistake. Last night, I was prepared to break things off with her - and then suddenly we fell into this marvelous conversation about architecture. And as it turns out, she detests the design of the Bilbao art museum as much as I do. "
"Niles: And you almost let her go. "
"Frasier: Yes, exactly Well, you know, Cassandra is a wonderful woman. But, well, Faye and I have a, a deeper connection - and to be fair, actually, she was the first to plant her flag on 'Terra Frasier.' "
"Niles: I'm starting to think Napoleon had a Frasier complex. "
"Frasier: Yes, all right "
"Frasier: Oh, there's Cassandra. I asked her here for coffee - I was going to tell her that we can't see each other any longer. "
"Niles: Good luck. "
"Frasier: Thank you, thank you, Niles. "
"Frasier: Cassandra. "
"Cassandra: Hi, honey. "
"Frasier: Hi. "
"Cassandra: I have great news. "
"Frasier: Really? "
"Cassandra: Those new promos are working wonders. I just got the numbers and you're really scoring with women between the ages of 25 and 49. "
"Frasier: Well, that's not always a good thing. "
"Cassandra: You alright? "
"Frasier: Actually, I-I wanted to talk to you about our relationship. You see, I... "
"Cassandra: I know where we're "
"going: a serious talk. "
"Frasier: You see, there comes a time in every relationship when you have to decide... "
"Cassandra: I know, whether we're going to be exclusive or not. I've been wanting to talk to you about that too. "
"Frasier: You have? "
"Cassandra: Yes. You see, I thought you should know that I've been seeing someone else. "
"Frasier: Really? "
"Cassandra: Does that bother you? "
"Frasier: No, no, no, no, actually, not at all. "
"Cassandra: Oh, good. "
"Frasier: Anyway, what I wanted to say was that- well, how long you been seeing this other fellow? "
"Cassandra: Not very long. You're not upset, are you? "
"Frasier: No, no, no, no. Actually, I was about to say- well, uh, what does he do? "
"Cassandra: He owns his own venture capital firm. Although he spends most of his time racing sail boats and rebuilding trails for the Sierra Club. "
"Frasier: Oh really, seems a little unfocused, doesn't he? "
"Cassandra: You are upset, aren't you? "
"Frasier: No, no, no, no. "
"Cassandra: Really, there's no reason to be jealous of Sloan "
"Frasier: Believe me, I am not jealous of Sloan If anything, I pity the man who has to go through life with a pretentious name like that "
"Cassandra: Frasier "
"Frasier: Alright, fine, fine. You know what, let's just drop the whole thing, alright? "
"Cassandra: Now, about those new promos.... "
"Frasier: Cassandra, I want us to be exclusive "
"Cassandra: What? "
"Frasier: Yes well, I'm the kind of person who can make a decision and commit to it. And I was hoping that you might be that sort of person too. "
"Cassandra: Frasier, I'm so touched. If you only want us to be with each other - that's great. I was supposed to see Sloan tonight, but I'm going to call him and cancel. "
"Frasier: Oh, that's wonderful - oh my god, that means we can spend the night together. "
"Niles: Looks like she took the news well - are you insane? "
"Frasier: Niles, I almost made a terrible mistake. "
"Niles: What could possibly have happened in the last four minutes to make you change your mind again? "
"Frasier: Actually, when Cassandra told me that she was seeing somebody else, it awakened something in me. "
"Niles: Oh, petty jealousy? "
"Frasier: No The realization that I couldn't bear to lose her. "
"Niles: Yes, and the minute you see Faye you'll reverse yourself again "
"Frasier: No, no, I won't. I'll prove it to you. Cassandra is the one I'm sure of it. "
"Frasier: Yes, Faye - it's Frasier. Uh, listen, I won't be able to join you for dinner tonight, but perhaps you could call me later - we need to talk. There, I've done it. Nothing says, 'It's over between us' quite like the phrase 'we need to talk.' You see, that was my problem, actually - I kept leaving the door open. "
"Niles: Well, I'm very proud of you, Frasier. "
"Frasier: Thank you. "
"Niles: An enlightened man is he who can learn from his mistakes. Squash tomorrow morning? "
"Frasier: Nine AM, my place. "
"Niles: See you then. "
"Cassandra: Well, I called him. I probably should feel guilty but I'm just so glad it's just the two of us now. "
"Frasier: I'm ecstatic. "
"Cassandra: I know a cute little bed-and-breakfast we can go to this weekend. "
"Frasier: Oh, really? "
"Cassandra: Thank you. "
"situation: "
"Frasier: What a relief this is. I've made my choice. Look at her, I've found an angel... an angel who wears an awful lot of makeup. I've never noticed that before. Faye doesn't paint her face up like that. "
"Cassandra: And they have the cutest little four poster beds in each room. "
"Frasier: That sounds lovely. My, she uses the word 'cute' a lot. I'm cute, this café is cute, now the bed is cute. Faye used the word 'jejeune' last night. "
"Cassandra: Oh, you know, I meant to tell you, I really liked how you handled that nasty caller yesterday. It was such a clever way of... "
"Frasier: God, all she talks about is work, work, work. And now I'll see her every morning before work, and at work, and after work. I feel trapped Can't breathe... Wait What are you doing? It's just your fear talking. She's a wonderful woman. She's the one. She's perfect "
"Cassandra: And then I ran into Roz after the show, and she told me the cutest little story that... "
"Frasier: Cassandra... we need to talk. "
"TO: "
"Faye: Frasier? "
"Frasier: Faye, hi. Uh, look, we-we really need to talk. "
"Faye: I know, I got your message. I thought you couldn't see me tonight. "
"Frasier: Yes, well I just had some unfinished business with the promotions department, but that's all done now. "
"Faye: Well, I wish you would had called, I would have put something on. "
"Frasier: No, no, you look beautiful. Listen, "
"Faye: I-I want us to be exclusive. "
"Faye: What? "
"Frasier: Yes, I want to take our relationship to the next level. I just want to be with you. "
"Faye: Wow. I'm a little surprised. You said 'we need to talk' on the machine, and you know, that usually means it's over. "
"Frasier: Really? I had no idea. "
"Faye: Well, this is wonderful "
"Frasier: Oh God, so it's just you and me. God, this is exhilarating. "
"Faye: Well, this is turning out to be the best day ever. Because, well, okay, Chris McKenna - the restaurant critic? - he comes over to the restaurant this morning and... "
"Frasier: What is she thinking with that ridiculous shirt? Tie-dyed? Stop it, Frasier. You can't do this to yourself. This is nothing more than the natural panic of finally making your choice. "
"Faye: ...and it turned out that the printer had messed up, and the menu said 'flab' instead of 'flan' "
"Frasier: And so is she, precious. My Faye - Faye, as in Faye-vourite. This feels so much better now that I've relaxed. I was about to doom this whole relationship with my neurotic nitpicking. But it's clear sailing now. "
"Faye: Well, enough about me. How was your day? "
"Frasier: Well, it certainly ended well. [she smiles and caresses his cheek] Although something funny did happen at the station – it was during the second hour of my show... "
"Faye: My God, he really does love to talk about himself. Is that another new pair of shoes? He's got more shoes than I do "

"Frasier: Good show today, Roz. "
"Roz: Yeah. "
"Frasier: Say, why all the catalogues? "
"Roz: I need to buy a present. "
"Frasier: Tiffany, Cartier, Neiman Marcus... "
"Roz: So does anything look good to you here? "
"Frasier: Well, let's see. Who could we be shopping for? Hmm, perhaps a honey-voiced radio therapist who's birthday's just around the corner? "
"Roz: No, this present is not for you - it's for your brother. "
"Frasier: Oh all right, Roz, don't be coy. I think it's very smart you fishing for hints like this - you wanted to avoid a misstep like you made last year. "
"Roz: What misstep? You said you loved Pagliacci. "
"Frasier: Yes, I said the opera, not the porcelain crying crown figurine "
"Roz: Look, Niles pulled some strings and got Alice on a list for a really good preschool, so I thought I'd just get him a little thank you gift, which was why I was asking for your stupid opinion in the first place. Forget it. "
"Frasier: All right, fine. "
"Roz: I'll figure it out for myself. "
"Frasier: Have it your own way, that's fine. But I tell you what, don't get him a porcelain Pagliacci. He already has one "
"Frasier: Hi, Dad. "
"Martin: Hey, Fras. You'll never guess who I just saw. I went over for a cup of coffee with Hank. You remember Hank? He's the security guard who works at Weston's jewelry store. Anyway, we were in his booth - just shooting the breeze, looking at the surveillance monitors, when who do I see buying an engagement ring, but Donny - as in 'Daphne & Donny.' "
"Frasier: Donny? Are you sure? "
"Martin: Yeah. Engagement rings is Tina's counter. We use the zoom lens on her. "
"Frasier: Dad, I'm shocked "
"Martin: Oh no, it's just innocent fun. She only dresses that way 'cause she knows we're looking at her "
"Frasier: About Daphne and Donny. I didn't realize they were this serious. "
"Martin: Well, they spend all their time together. "
"Frasier: This is going to crush Niles. "
"Martin: Yeah, I know. "
"Frasier: Do you think we should tell him? "
"Martin: No, it's none of our business We do not tell Niles and we definitely do not tell Daphne "
"Daphne: Tell Daphne what? "
"Martin: Nothing. "
"Daphne: It's bad news, isn't it? "
"Martin: No, it's not bad news. "
"Daphne: Is it about my mum, did they find something during her physical - they did, didn't they? I'll have to call her. "
"Frasier: No Daphne, there is absolutely no news. "
"Martin: And even if there were, it's not up to us to tell you about it. "
"Daphne: Who should tell me then? The head surgeon, our family minister? "
"Martin: No "
"Daphne: The mortician? I've got to pack, I hope I'm not too late "
"Martin: I just saw Donny buying you an engagement ring. "
"Frasier: That is the news "
"Daphne: Really? I don't believe it, I'm going to get married I'm so excited I'm going to be a 'Mrs.' Mrs. Donny Douglas Oh, Mrs. Donald Ronald Douglas Oh my God "
"Frasier: I guess we're going to have to prepare Niles now, he's on his way over here. "
"Martin: Yeah, well don't tell him here. I don't want him going to pieces in front of Daphne. "
"Frasier: I guess I could tell him at the restaurant. "
"Martin: Don't take him to one of those fancy wine bistros that you guys love. News like this calls for hard liquor, big glasses "
"Frasier: Wherever it is, I just think it's best that Niles hears it from me and not from Daphne. "
"Niles: Hear what from Daphne? "
"Frasier: I'll tell you at the restaurant. "
"Niles: No, I don't want to wait till we get to the bistro. "
"Frasier: You're just going to have to wait. "
"Martin: And you're not going to any bistro "
"Niles: Well fine, then if you won't tell me, I'll just ask Daphne myself. "
"Frasier: Niles, wait. The truth "
"is: Daphne's... "
"Martin: ...mother is dying. "
"Niles: Oh, dear God. "
"Frasier: Yes. Tragic, isn't it? You know, she's going to need all the support that we can give her. "
"Daphne: Evening, Dr. Crane. "
"Frasier: Well, come on, Niles, we don't want to lose our table. "
"Daphne: Have you heard the news? "
"Niles: I just did, what can I say? "
"Daphne: Oh, I've thought about this day, ever since I was a little girl. "
"Niles: I'm sure you have. "
"Daphne: It's even better than I thought it would be "
"Daphne: I can already picture the big "
"day: beautiful flowers everywhere, a sea of smiling faces, and I suppose everyone will want to have their picture taken with the lady of the hour. "
"Frasier: You know, maybe Daphne could use a little quiet time. "
"Daphne: Oh, who could be quiet? I'm so happy. Donny's going to ask me to marry him "
"Niles: What? "
"Daphne: Now, come the big day you'll all sit right up front with my family. Because that's what you are to "
"me: family. [hugs Martin] "
"Martin: Well, that's what you are to us too, Daph. "
"Niles: I am so thrilled for you. "
"Daphne: Oh thank you, thank you all "
"Martin: I'm sorry, son. "
"Frasier: Do you want to talk? "
"Niles: Er, no. Frasier, if you wouldn't mind I'm gonna cancel dinner. I need to be alone. "
"Frasier: Of course, Niles, but if you need me - call. "
"Martin: Oh, poor kid "
"Frasier: Oh, he'll be all right, Dad. You know, Niles is a lot stronger than we give him credit for. "
"Frasier: Hello? Hold the elevator, I'll be right there. "
"Martin: Hang in there son, he's on his way. "
"TO: "
"Niles: Yes? "
"Woodson: This came while you were in session. It's from a Roz Doyle, she wanted to thank you for a favor that you did. [hands the bag over] "
"Niles: Ah. "
"Woodson: I'll be off now. "
"Niles: All right. Goodnight, Mrs. Woodson. "
"Niles: Come in, Mrs. Woodson. "
"Daphne: I'm afraid it's me, Dr. Crane. "
"Niles: Daphne, what are you doing here? "
"Daphne: I know I should have called first but I need to talk to you. It's sort of a private matter and I hoped we could talk here. "
"Niles: Well, it's not really appropriate for me to act as your therapist, but if it's just advice from a friend you need I'd be happy to lend an ear. What's on your mind? "
"Daphne: Well, I don't think I can marry Donny. I think there's somebody else I'm meant to be with. "
"Niles: Who is it? "
"Woodson: It's Mrs... "
"Niles: Oh for God's sake, go home [she does, then to Daphne] Sorry for that interruption. Anyway, this man you're meant to be with - who is he? "
"Daphne: I'm afraid I can't say. "
"Niles: Yes you can, we're the only ones here. "
"Daphne: Are you sure you won't laugh at me? "
"Niles: How could you possibly think I would laugh at you? "
"Daphne: Well, most people would if I told them I'd seen the love of my life in a psychic vision. "
"Niles: Well, most people are... What? "
"Daphne: You know how I have these psychic flashes from time to time? Well, I had one last night. "
"Niles: Oh you had a vision about... the love of your life. Okay, well tell me about it. And Daphne, omit nothing "
"Daphne: All right, I was straightening up the living room when I had a sudden flash of a wedding ceremony for Donny and me. Oh, it was lovely; the church was packed to the rafters. My mum was there in a peach silk looking very smart, my brothers in their suits.... "
"Niles: You know, I may have led you in the wrong direction with the 'omit' business, feel free to skip ahead. "
"Daphne: My father had just walked me up to the altar and I was standing there facing Donny. He looked quite natty, black tuxedo, tails, very slimming... "
"Niles: We're skipping. "
"Daphne: Well, then the vicar began the ceremony. He asked if anyone had a reason why we shouldn't wed and that's when this... well, this person stood up and said that he did. He said that he was the true love of my life, though he'd never had the courage to say so. Ah, I feel so awkward telling you all this. "
"Niles: Don't. I think I know who this person is. "
"Daphne: You do? "
"Niles: Yes. "
"Daphne: Well, I don't see how you could. I couldn't tell myself. "
"Daphne: He was standing in the shadows and I couldn't see his face. All I could make out was that he was wearing a red bow tie. "
"Niles: I don't have a... clue why anyone would wear such a thing to a wedding. "
"Daphne: Heavens, I can't believe I'm talking about my visions to a psychiatrist. Your brother would think I was daft. "
"Niles: Well, Frasier's never really shared my mystical spiritual bent. "
"Daphne: This does mean I'm going to have to turn down Donny's proposal. You don't think that would be crazy? "
"Niles: Not at all. "
"Daphne: Then you really believe in psychic visions too? "
"Niles: I do. "
"Daphne: Oh, thank you, Dr. Crane. That means a lot to me. Of course if I can't marry Donny, I can't very well go on dating him. That would just be leading him on. "
"Niles: That's very true. "
"Daphne: I don't know how I'm going to break it off with him. "
"Niles: If you want to write a letter... I have stationary and a fax machine. "
"Daphne: No. I have to tell him to his face. I do hate to let him go, though. "
"Niles: I know it's hard, but it's the only ethical thing to do. "
"Daphne: Now I see why people come to you. You always point them in the right direction. "
"Niles: Well, I'd be a poor excuse for a psychiatrist if I didn't. "
"Time: 9"
":50) "
"Frasier: What's Eddie doing? "
"Martin: Every time this cooking show comes on, he rolls over and watches it upside down. He likes all the pouring they do. He thinks it's funny the way the food goes up instead of down. "
"Daphne: Evening. "
"Martin: Hey, Daph. Donny called, he said he'd be here by eight. Do you think he'll pop the question tonight? "
"Daphne: I hope not. "
"Martin: What's the matter? "
"Daphne: I've decided to break up with him tonight. "
"Martin: What? You wanted to marry him yesterday. "
"Daphne: Well, you know how I have these visions from time to time, and don't tell Dr. Crane, well... "
"Frasier: Don't tell me what? "
"Daphne: Nothing. "
"Frasier: It's my car again, isn't it "
"Daphne: It's not your bloody car "
"Martin: She's breaking up with Donny because of some vision. "
"Daphne: I asked you not to mention that "
"Frasier: What vision? "
"Daphne: I know you'll make fun of me. But I had a vision that I'm meant to be with another man. "
"Martin: Who? "
"Daphne: I couldn't see his face. I don't know anything about him. He was just wearing a red bow tie. "
"Frasier: Are you seriously going to dump Donny because of some psychic vision, don't you think that's a little unwise? "
"Daphne: Well, your brother didn't think so. "
"Frasier: Niles knows about this? "
"Daphne: Yes, he helped me to see that ending things with Donny was my only choice. Unlike you, he believes in my visions; he knows I have a gift. "
"Frasier: Yes, he's been trying to unwrap it for six years "
"Frasier: That'll be Donny. "
"Martin: What do you think about all this vision stuff? "
"Frasier: Obviously there's some psychological reason that she's having second thoughts. It's got nothing to do with an apparition in a red bow tie. "
"Frasier: Niles, you jackass, will you take that thing off "
"Niles: I admit it's a bit of a departure for me, but I'm feeling a bit kitschy today. "
"Frasier: Yes, I know. Daphne told us how you encouraged her to follow her vision and dump Donny. I am astonished at your lack of integrity Now will you take that damn thing off What the hell did you hope to accomplish with that anyway? "
"Niles: I was simply trying to nudge Daphne into the realization that I am the man in her vision. "
"Martin: Niles "
"Niles: But why else would she come to me? "
"Frasier: Surely, you of all people realizes that there is some psychological basis for these visions of hers. It represents a fear of some kind. A fear of intimacy, a fear of commitment, a fear of the Windsor Knot, who knows? "
"Daphne: Was that Donny at the door? "
"Frasier: Oh no, just Niles, Daphne. You know, we were just discussing these visions of yours. "
"Daphne: Look, I'm in no mood to be mocked. "
"Frasier: I'm not mocking you, Daphne, and I'm not trying to influence you in anyway, either. It's just that I was wondering... um, have these psychic warnings ever come to you before - say, at a critical juncture in a relationship? "
"Daphne: No Well, actually yes. Once when my first boyfriend proposed I had a vision telling me that there was somebody better waiting - which there "
"was: Clive. "
"Frasier: But you dumped Clive. "
"Daphne: Look, er, I don't have time for this right now. "
"Frasier: Oh yes, no fear of commitment there. "
"Niles: It's just as possible that she knew those men were wrong for her. Isn't that right, Dad? "
"Martin: Leave me out of this. I'm just looking for my TV Guide. "
"Niles: Well, I could use a little support here. "
"Martin: Well, maybe that's why I said to leave me out of it. I'm sorry, Niles. I want you to be happy but I'm with your brother on this. "
"Frasier: Niles, the fact is you don't know what causes these visions, and yet you still advised her to walk away from a wonderful relationship. It doesn't make you much of a psychiatrist. "
"Niles: That's your opinion. "
"Frasier: Yes well, here's a second "
"opinion: it doesn't make you much of a friend. "
"Martin: Are you sure you didn't throw it away in the recycling? "
"Frasier: Are you actually looking for the TV Guide? "
"Martin: Well I have to plan my weekend "
"Frasier: You really do have the world on a string, don't you, Dad? "
"Niles: Look Daphne, I've been thinking about our talk this afternoon. I'm not sure I gave you the best advice I could have. Perhaps what you call a vision is really a fear - a fear of commitment, say. That would explain why these visions come to you when your relationships turn serious. Mind you, I can't tell you that Donny is the right person for you, but I wouldn't want you to end things with him for the wrong reasons. Do you understand? "
"Daphne: Yeah, you're just like your brother after all. This afternoon you were just humoring me, weren't you? "
"Niles: No, Daphne. "
"Daphne: Look at the idiot from Manchester, she thinks she has visions "
"Niles: No, no, all I'm saying is that I think there are psychological issues here that you just don't entirely appreciate. "
"Daphne: Well, how could I? I'm just some nut who believes in fate. Well, I've always followed my visions and [swelling up in the eyes] your pity's not going to change that. "
"Daphne: That'll be Donny. Could one of you get the door? "
"Daphne: Well, you've seen me do it enough times. You just turn the handle and pull "
"Donny: Hey, Frasier. Is Daphne ready? "
"Frasier: She'll be out in a minute. "
"Donny: Oh, good, good. Oh, what's that you're drinking there? "
"Frasier: Sherry. "
"Donny: Oh. Yeah, I'll have one. "
"Martin: So, how's business? "
"Donny: Well, actually I've cut down on my caseload. I want to spend more time with Daphne. Don't tell her this but I've booked us on an Alaskan vacation next month. I guess it's one of the few places left where you can feel completely alone. "
"Martin: Ah, you like that feeling, huh? "
"Daphne: Donny. "
"Donny: Hi, honey. "
"Daphne: So are we on our way then? "
"Donny: Well actually, I've got something on my mind that I'd kinda like to talk about first... "
"Donny: No, no, I'd like you to stay here for this. If it wasn't for you then I never would have met Daphne... "
"Frasier: Donny, I think it would be best... "
"Donny: It's okay. Sit "
"Martin: Maybe I'll have a little bit of this sherry. [He gulps down a glass at once] "
"Donny: You know, I thought that being a divorce attorney would have just soured me on relationships... and then I met you. And I found myself telling my clients to reconcile, because I think that if they could find even just a tiny little bit of the happiness that I've found with you they could make it. I've been thinking about that time we went to the little bed- and-breakfast in the country and we sat in that porch swing all night. When I looked at the sky, you told me your dad and you used to sit on your step and do the same thing when you were a kid. He said that the only man good enough for you would 'scoop the stars out of the sky with his hat and lay them at your feet.' Well... I've only caught this one so far. But if you'll accept it, I'll spend my life chasing down the rest of them for you. "
"Donny: I know it's very soon, so just think about it. "
"Daphne: I don't have to think about it... Yes "
"Donny: Boys, give me a "
"break: you look more surprised than I do. "
"Frasier: Oh, we're just so happy for you. "
"Niles: Oh, that's wonderful. Excuse me, I need to... "
"Frasier: Yes, champagne, let me help you. "
"Frasier: Oh Niles, I'm so sorry... "
"Martin: Frasier, why don't you just take this champagne in there and stay out there for a second? "
"Martin: I'd do anything to fix this for you. "
"Niles: I know. It's my own fault. I had chance after chance to tell her how I feel, but I always kept my mouth shut. 'Til tonight, when I probably should have. "
"Martin: Well, you can't regret what you said. It was the right thing to do, and that's something I can always count on from you. "
"Niles: Thanks, Dad. "
"Martin: Well, I'm going to get me some of that champagne. "
"Niles: Me, too. "
"Daphne: Just a second, Dr. Crane. I'm sorry I got cross with you. Once I thought about what you said it really made sense, and then when Donny did ask me it was fear that I felt – just like you told me. I figured the best way to overcome it was to just jump in with both feet. Thank you for your help. "
"Niles: I wish you the very best, Daphne. "
"Donny: Hey, don't squeeze so hard That's a precious commodity right "
"there: my number one client "
"TO: "
"Daphne: Still looking for that TV guide? "
"Martin: Yeah, it's the damnedest thing. What are you still doing up? Where's Donny? "
"Daphne: He's on the phone with my folks. He really is wonderful, Mr. Crane. "
"Martin: I've very happy for you, Daph. "
"Daphne: Oh my God. I just had that vision again. Only this time... oh, that's a bit scary. My mystery man is standing with some sort of dragon. "
"Martin: A dragon? "
"Daphne: Yes, that makes no sense. It must be just what Dr. Crane said, these visions are about my fears. "
"Martin: God, yes. "
"Daphne: Imagine spending the rest of my life looking for some poor bloke with a dragon. "
"Martin: Wow, that's weird. "
"Daphne: What? "
"Martin: I just had a vision myself. "
"Daphne: What is it? "
"Martin: It's a mystery woman, she's standing in the kitchen - she's making me a Monte Cristo sandwich. "
"Daphne: Oh, brother "
"Martin: Oh no, it's just a grilled cheese "
"Daphne: Make it yourself, you lazy old sod "

"Niles: Oh, Roz "

"Roz: Oh, hey, Niles. "
"Niles: Hey, Roz. "
"Roz: God, do you realize how pathetic this is? It's 9"
":30 on a Saturday night and neither one of us is surprised to see the other one here alone. I've never seen this place looking so grim. "
"Niles: Oh, this is Mardi Gras compared to half an hour ago, when it was just me and an elderly gentleman who cleaned his teeth with his coffee stirrer, and then put them back in his mouth. Let me get the waitress. [catching the waitress's eye] "
"Roz: Oh God, not her, I hate her. She's in my spinning class at the gym. I've been killing myself trying to take off these last five pregnancy pounds, and nothing Meanwhile she's down at the snack bar stuffing her face and waving to everybody. She's such a phony. "
"Kit: Hi, Roz. "
"Roz: Hey, Kit, you were great in class tonight "
"Kit: Are you kidding? I've been such an oinker lately. What can I get you? "
"Roz: Oh, a non-fat latte for me. "
"Kit: Coming right up. "
"Roz: See what I mean? She's such a fake. "
"Niles: I'm sorry, Roz, I'm afraid I'm not going to be very good company tonight. "
"Roz: Well, whatever your problems are, you'll laugh at them when you hear what I've been through. I had a date tonight. I got halfway down my driveway when he called me on my car phone and cancelled. I was too humiliated to go back in the house and face the sitter, so - don't ask me why - I went to the zoo. You really want to feel good about yourself? Put on your best outfit and walk through the monkey house on a Saturday night. And be sure and stop by and see Remo the baboon, who knows all kinds of ways to have fun without a date. Feeling better about your problem? "
"Niles: Daphne and Donny got engaged yesterday. "
"Roz: Oh my God. "
"Niles: Yeah, and lucky me, I had to sit there and watch, horrified. There wasn't a thing I could to do stop it - much like your monkey house experience. "
"Roz: I am so sorry, Niles. You really did have a worse night than I did. "
"Noel: Hey, Roz "
"Roz: Oh wait, I'm gaining on you. "
"Noel: Isn't this a splendiferous surprise? So Roz, Dr. Crane - is this a date? "
"Niles: No, just a chance meeting. Sorry. "
"Noel: So Roz, where is this person you told me you had a date with? "
"Roz: That got cancelled. "
"Noel: Oh... 'cancelled,' you say? And here you are, showing up at my regular Saturday night hangout. Will the coincidences never stop? Perhaps you'd care to join me for a late supper? "
"Roz: No, Noel. As I said earlier, I'm really not in the mood. "
"Noel: Playing hard to get, I see. It's all part of the mating dance. Watch and learn. "
"Niles: Morning. "
"Frasier: Ah, Niles. Armani? At eight in the morning on a Sunday? "
"Niles: Yes, yes, I'm having lunch with Maris. "
"Martin: With Maris? "
"Niles: Yeah. We scheduled this weeks ago. She still has some of my first editions, and I thought she might be more amenable to returning them if I took her to her favorite bistro. "
"Frasier: Oh, well then, the worst you're out is a cup of clear broth. "
"Niles: No, this is lunch. She takes her large meal in the evening. I'm sorry to barge in so early, but I had to get out of the Montana. The couple next door were just married and they kept me up all week with their boisterous lovemaking. Why is it when you're by yourself there's nothing but couples in love rubbing it in your face? "
"Faye: Good morning Niles, are you going to join us for breakfast? "
"Niles: For breakfast? Well, actually- "
"Faye: Oh, come on, you've got to. I brought some pastries from the restaurant. "
"Martin: I didn't even hear you two come in last night. "
"Frasier: Well, we got in kind of late. We took a long walk after dinner. "
"Faye: Yeah, it was great. The streets were deserted, it was all misty out. It was like we were the only two people in town. "
"Niles: I wonder if Maris would rather have breakfast than lunch. "
"Frasier: Oh, Niles, put that down. "
"Martin: Now wait, Frasier, if Niles wants to leave- "
"Frasier: Dad, please, there's no need for Niles to feel awkward. You're here. It's not like he's some third wheel. "
"Bonnie: Good morning. "
"Martin: Hey You boys remember Bonnie, from McGinty's? "
"Frasier: Yes, of course. "
"Bonnie: I was at the Super Bowl party, remember? I brought the ham loaf. "
"Frasier: Well, who could forget? We talked about it long after. "
"Niles: It came up almost daily. "
"Bonnie: Aren't you sweet? I'm just going to get some coffee. "
"Martin: Okay. You could have told me you were having Faye over. "
"Frasier: Well, I'm sorry, Dad. I didn't realize you were seeing Bonnie. "
"Martin: Yeah, I see her from time to time. You got a problem with Bonnie? "
"Frasier: Well, no. "
"Martin: Because if you're bringing it up, you know, I have second thoughts about Faye. I liked the other one you were seeing, Cassandra. She was a dish "
"Frasier: I don't care. I prefer Faye. I had to make a choice, no matter how much fun it was dating two beautiful women. "
"Niles: This morning just gets better and better. "
"Bonnie: Who wants coffee and pastry? "
"Niles: Nothing for me, thanks. "
"Faye: Are you sure? I make a mean nutcake. "
"Niles: No, that's all right, I'm meeting one for lunch. "
"Frasier: So, Bonnie, I see you've met Cassandra. "
"Faye: Who? "
"Frasier: Oh, Lord, I'm sorry. Faye "
"Faye: Who's Cassandra? "
"Frasier: Uh, my... Aunt Cassandra. Yes, that must be the-the connection. See, you remind me a bit of her. She was an angel, wasn't she, Dad? "
"Martin: Oh, Cassandra? Great gal. I wish she was around. "
"Bonnie: Ah, Eddie, good morning. I'll bet you can't wait to meet Lady. "
"Martin: Yeah, we're getting Eddie together with Bonnie's poodle. We figure if we hit it off, maybe something will happen for them. Even dogs deserve happiness "
"Niles: Okay, well, I'll be off. "
"Bonnie: Oh, hold on, you've got a loose button right there. "
"Niles: No, no, it's all right. "
"Bonnie: No, it's about to come off. "
"Niles: No- "
"Bonnie: See? Here, I'll sew it back on for you. I've got needle and thread. You don't want to lose it, do you? "
"Niles: I'm trying not to. Frasier, I have to get out of here "
"Frasier: Now Niles, listen, just relax. There's no cause for an anxiety attack. "
"Donny: Good morning "
"Frasier: Breathe into this "
"Martin: I didn't know you two were going to be here last night. Why doesn't somebody say something? "
"Donny: Well, we planned on going to my place, but we ended up going to a little piano bar just around the corner from here. "
"Daphne: Such a charming spot. So intimate. And to top it off, the piano player knew all my favorite songs - 'Yesterday', 'As Long As He Needs Me,' 'Climb Every Mountain.' "
"Frasier: Well, you threw him some real curves there. "
"Donny: Hi, I'm Donny Douglas, and I'm... in love. "
"Daphne: Listen to him. He embarrasses me like that at least ten times a day. And I just can't get enough of it. "
"Niles: How we coming on the button? "
"Bonnie: I've almost got the needle threaded. "
"Frasier: All right You know, if anybody's hungry, we've got plenty of goodies here from Le Cigare Volante. Cassandra's the pastry chef there. "
"Faye: She is? I thought I was. "
"Frasier: I'm so sorry God, I did it again. I guess I must have her name on my mind. "
"Faye: Well, that's okay. Just try to remember mine. "
"Faye: Faye "
"Frasier: Faye Oh, Faye... "
"Donny: You know, I'm kind of glad this worked out the way it did. Neither Daphne nor I has any family here in Seattle. You know what I'd like to do? I'd like to make this our engagement breakfast. "
"Donny: Surrounded by friends who treat us like family. And I'd like to dedicate it to the woman who's filled my life with a joy I never thought I'd find. "
"Bonnie: Ah, Marty, I think I'm gonna cry. "
"Martin: Ah, jeez... "
"Faye: Oh my God, look at that ring. "
"Frasier: That's it for today. This is Dr. Frasier Crane saying goodbye, and good mental health. "
"Frasier: Nice job there, Roz. Could you please try to find some callers that have real psychological problems? "
"Roz: Your dad's on Line 2. "
"Frasier: I meant during the show, thanks. Yeah, Dad, hi. What, again? Oh, that's the third time he's cancelled this week. You know, he's been so lonely you'd think he'd be glad for my company. Well, all right, no matter. I guess I'll see you home in a while. Oh, I don't know, later. Oh, maybe an hour, two hours, I don't know Oh, for God's sake, well just hang a tie on the door if you're so worried about it "
"Roz: Is everything okay, Frasier? "
"Frasier: Yeah, Roz. I was thinking about something. You know, it's funny how loneliness can make people behave in strange ways. "
"Roz: What do you mean? "
"Frasier: Oh, you know, do things that are sort of rash, and act out of character. "
"Roz: Oh God, I knew someone would find out about it Who told you? Did he tell you? I'll kill him "
"Frasier: Roz "
"Roz: Oh please, Frasier, don't tell anybody else Oh, I beg you It was one night, one lonely, stupid night "
"Frasier: What are you talking about? "
"Roz: You don't know? "
"Frasier: No What happened? "
"Roz: Nothing, I'll see you tomorrow. "
"Frasier: Roz Stay right here. Now you listen to me, I am your friend, you know that. I would never judge you. Now, just how... stupid and lonely were you? "
"Roz: It's the last person I ever would have dreamed of. "
"Roz: I guess I haven't been dating much lately and I just I've been so lonely. "
"Frasier: Oh my God You've slept with Noel. "
"Roz: NO Oh, how could you even think such a thing "
"Frasier: All right, just tell me. Who was it? "
"Roz: Nobody. It doesn't matter. It's over. It was a mistake and I just want to forget it ever happened. "
"Frasier: Roz, Roz, listen, we've all been there. Come on. You were just looking for a little comfort. It's all right. No reason to beat yourself up about it. "
"Bulldog: Hey, baby, I'm sorry I had to skip out before breakfast. "
"Roz: Oh, Bulldog "
"Frasier: Bulldog? "
"Roz: Bulldog. "
"Bulldog: Bulldog "
"Roz: Oh, Frasier, swear you won't tell anybody else "
"Bulldog: So you told the doc, eh? Guess you just had to brag, huh? Hey, I don't blame you. I told a few guys myself. "
"Roz: Oh God, oh God, oh God "
"Bulldog: Gee, where have I heard that before? "
"Frasier: I'll just leave you two alone. "
"Roz: I'm right behind you. "
"Bulldog: Gee, where have I heard that before? "
"Roz: Stop that Look, Bulldog, last night was a mistake. I will regret it for the rest of my life, and if you ever bring it up again, I promise you you'll regret it. "
"Bulldog: Hey... "
"Bulldog: Your place tonight? "
"Roz: Ten o'clock. Use the service elevator. "
"Daphne: How's the speech coming along? "
"Donny: Oh, it's almost finished. 'So though you are graduating today, your learning has just begun-' There's something under the cushions back here. "
"Daphne: What, you found something? "
"Donny: Oh, it's a cell phone. "
"Daphne: Oh. "
"Donny: Is this Frasier's? "
"Daphne: No, he had his when he left for work this morning. Must be his brother's. I'll tell him the next time he's over. I'm... going to finish tidying up the kitchen. "
"Frasier: Hello, all. "
"Donny: Hey, Frasier. "
"Frasier: Hello, Donny. I hope I didn't come home at an inconvenient moment. "
"Donny: No, your timing's perfect, actually. One eggroll left. "
"Donny: Nice hands. "
"Frasier: Yes, they were. "
"Daphne: Here's your drink. "
"Donny: Oh, thanks. Isn't she great? Takes me on a three mile run and then feeds me diet soda. I thought I'd hate healthy living, but you know, it ain't so bad. "
"Frasier: Daphne, why are you wearing that rubber glove? "
"Daphne: What, this? I was, um... doing the dishes. "
"Frasier: With just one? "
"Daphne: It's the English way. You wash with the left, dry with the right. Started during the war, I think, when rubber was rationed. "
"Frasier: Oh, yes. "
"Daphne: Can I see you in the kitchen, Dr. Crane? "
"Frasier: Yes, of course. Let me just call Niles first. He cancelled on me again today. "
"Donny: Oh, I'll just be a second here. I just have to check up on a case I'm finishing. Poor bastard, I'm really taking him to the cleaners. "
"Frasier: Well, perhaps you'd be so kind as to bring the couch along. "
"to: Kitchen "
"Frasier: Yes, Daphne? "
"Daphne: I'm afraid a terrible thing has happened. I've lost my engagement ring. "
"Frasier: Well, where was the last place you saw it? "
"Daphne: That's just it, I've searched everywhere I'm terrified Donny'll find out. "
"Frasier: Daphne, you can't go around hiding your hand forever. You're gonna have to tell him. He's a reasonable man, he'll understand. "
"Daphne: I suppose you're right. "
"Donny: You're negligent, pal You're criminally irresponsible, you were careless, and you're going to pay for it Yeah [hanging up and tossing the cordless phone to Frasier] Here you go, boss. "
"Frasier: Thank you. "
"Donny: Hey, Daph? "
"Daphne: Yes, love? "
"Donny: What are you doing? "
"Daphne: Oh, I'm just stuffing the bird for Dr. Crane's dinner. "
"Donny: Oh. Listen, unfortunately I'm going to have to work late. I'm going to just pop in the shower and then I'll have to leave. "
"Daphne: Oh, I'm sorry. "
"Donny: Oh, that's okay. Absence just makes the heart grow fonder. "
"Frasier: You know, Daphne, if that ring never turns up, that chicken works, too. Just see how it catches the light. "
"Daphne: Oh, stop it I'm just going to go have a look in the bedroom. "
"Frasier: Hello? Niles? It's Frasier. Yes, listen, I've tried you at your office, I've tried you at home, now I'm calling your cell phone. If I don't reach you now I'm actually going to get very worried about you. "
"Martin: Hello? "
"Frasier: Yes, hello, is Niles Crane there, please? "
"Martin: Uh, I don't know, I just got here. Let me go check. "
"Martin: Frasier, have you seen Niles? "
"Frasier: I'm just trying to reach him, Dad. "
"Martin: Oh, okay. "
"Martin: No, I'm sorry, he's not here, but I'll write your name down and give it to him. Wait a minute, I've gotta find a pen. "
"Martin: Frasier, have you seen my- "
"Frasier: Dad, please, I'm on the phone "
"Martin: Well, I'm sorry, I was just looking for a pen Forget it. "
"Martin: Hello? Listen, could you maybe call back in an hour? "
"Frasier: Dad? "
"Martin: Would you mind, please? I'm on the phone "
"Frasier: Dad, it's me. "
"Martin: Frasier, why did you call from the kitchen? You could have just walked in here "
"Frasier: Just hang up the phone. For God's sake, it must be Niles's cell phone. Gee, that's strange. He's never without that phone. "
"Martin: Huh. "
"Frasier: And what's more, he's been avoiding me for the last three days. "
"Martin: Oh, cut him a little slack. Seeing the six of us the other morning couldn't have done much for his mood. He's probably just gone off somewhere to be by himself. "
"Frasier: Well, I just hope he hasn't done something foolish. Remember he was having brunch with Maris on Sunday. "
"Martin: Oh, that was just business. "
"Frasier: Well, you know, Dad, he is broken-hearted. People in his condition have a tendency to run back to their exes. A lonely man clinging to an available warm body. Well, of course in Maris's case, that's just an expression. "
"Martin: He just spent two years divorcing her. He's not going to go back to her. "
"Frasier: Yeah, I hope you're right. Say, didn't you have plans today with Bonnie? "
"Martin: Oh, it was cut short. We had an incident. "
"Frasier: Really? What happened? "
"Martin: Oh, we took the dogs to this park near Bonnie's, and I knew there'd be a little sizing each other up and everything. But this poodle of hers, Lady - which she ain't - walks right up to Eddie, knocks him over and then sits her big French butt right on his head. "
"Frasier: You're kidding. "
"Martin: No. And the worst thing was, he just lay there whimpering and took it. And Bonnie, she thought it was really cute. I mean, what kind of a person likes to see a dog humiliated? "
"Frasier: Dad, may I remind you that not a holiday goes by that you don't dress that dog up in some sort of ridiculous hat? "
"Martin: Hey, there's nothing wrong with those hats. He looks good in hats. He's got a hat face "
"Martin: Well, he was probably just intimidated being over in Lady's park, you know. Wait'll he gets over to this side of town. He owns that park. Even the big dogs are scared of him. "
"Frasier: That's because they've seen him in his hats and they think he's crazy "
"Frasier: It's Niles's cell phone. Hello? Niles Crane's... phone. Yes, it's his brother. I'll be glad to tell him. Thank you. "
"Frasier: Well. That was St. Pierre jewelers. The diamond earrings Niles ordered are ready. "
"Martin: Diamond earrings? "
"Frasier: Uh-huh. From Maris's favorite jeweler. You know what, he's obviously too afraid to tell us that he's run back to her. "
"Martin: Now stop that, you're scaring me. He doesn't have to be with Maris. Maybe he's hurt, maybe he's in the hospital or something. "
"Frasier: We've got to track him down and talk some sense into him. I'll tell you what, we'll head over to the Montana, and if he's not there, we'll go to Maris's. "
"Martin: Well, I don't want to go to Niles's and I sure as hell don't want to go to Maris's "
"Frasier: Dad, this is not about what you or I want, this is about what Niles needs For God's sakes, the man is devastated, he's vulnerable. We need to rally around him and show him our support. "
"Martin: Well, why didn't we just do this on Sunday? "
"Frasier: We had our girlfriends over "
"Frasier: Dad, what are you doing back there? What are you so worried about? "
"Martin: Well, what do you think? Running into Maris. You know how angry she gets. I just wish we had a sharp stick or a heavy net or something. "
"Frasier: Niles "
"Niles: Yes? "
"Frasier: Niles, where have you been? You haven't been answering any of my calls. "
"Niles: Oh, Frasier, I am so sorry. I'll call you tomorrow. "
"Frasier: No. I want to talk to you right now. "
"Niles: Well, I can't. I'm, I'm... entertaining, so off you go. "
"Martin: No, we're not leaving without you, so put on your shower shoes and a coat and let's get out of here. "
"Niles: What is wrong with you? "
"Frasier: Niles, I know how difficult the last three weeks have been for you. I'm sorry, you are making a big mistake. This is NOT the way to handle it. "
"Niles: So - you know what's going on? "
"Martin: Yes, Niles "
"Frasier: How did this whole thing even get started? "
"Niles: Well, we had an impromptu coffee at the Café Nervosa, and that led to a movie, and that led to dinner, and ever since then we've been practically inseparable and to tell you the truth, we're kind of happy about it. [Frasier and Martin look disgusted] How do you even know about this? "
"Frasier: Your jeweler called. Your diamond earrings are ready. "
"Niles: Oh, well, thank you for the message. Now go away "
"Frasier: No Niles, we're not going anywhere. You may consider this a full-blown intervention. We're not leaving until you have got some self-respect back "
"Kit: Niles You know what we should do tonight? [seeing Frasier and Martin] Oh, hi. Build a fire and make s'mores. "
"Frasier: You might also want to get some graham crackers. "
"Kit: [coming down to the living room and putting her arms around Niles] I'm sorry, I didn't know we had company. "
"Niles: No, no, that's okay. Kit, this is- "
"Kit: No, wait, I know you from the cafe. Cappuccino, light foam. And you too. Coffee, black, nothin' fancy "
"Niles: Isn't that good? Kit, this is my father, Martin, and my brother, um... Frasier. "
"Frasier: How do you do? "
"Kit: Really? Oh, I see it. Cool "
"Frasier: You know, this is sort of a surprise, I guess. We didn't expect to see the two of you together. "
"Kit: Oh, I had my eye him from the minute I saw him. He's always so neatly put together. I just couldn't wait to mess him up "
"Niles: And mission accomplished "
"Frasier: So, Niles, you haven't seen Maris then since Sunday? "
"Niles: Oh, is that who you thought I was here with? That's funny. No wonder you were upset. "
"Kit: Who's Maris? "
"Niles: My ex-wife. "
"Kit: Well, if you want to see her too, that's cool. I told you, no strings. Just fun. "
"Martin: You always want your kids to have more than you had.

"Frasier: Niles, pick up, will you? It's Frasier. All right, fine. Call me later. I don't even know why I bother anymore. He doesn't pick up phones these days, just waitresses. "
"Roz: Give him a break, he's just having fun. "
"Frasier: That's exactly what I'd expect to hear from someone who's willing to spend the night as Bulldog's squeak toy. "
"Roz: That is not funny It was one night, and I would appreciate it if you would just let it drop. "
"Frasier: You're right, I'm sorry, that was tactless of me. Tell you what, let me make it up to you. I've got an extra theater ticket tonight. Faye's busy, why don't you join me? "
"Roz: No, thanks. "
"Frasier: No, please, Roz. It's a delightful little show. I'll even throw in dinner. "
"Roz: Busy. "
"Frasier: Really. A date? "
"Roz: I have plans Plans What are you, a cop? I've got to account for every waking minute? My private life is my own business "
"Frasier: Bulldog "
"Roz: I don't know what's wrong with me I'm weak. I can't stop myself "
"Frasier: Yes you can, Roz. "
"Roz: Okay, I don't want to stop myself. He's good. He's really good. I mean, I'm better, but he's trainable. "
"Frasier: Roz, it's Bulldog Doesn't that bother you? "
"Roz: You'd think. "
"Bulldog: Hey, Doc. "
"Frasier: Bulldog. "
"Bulldog: Oh, Roz, you still going to help me, uh, write those... promos for my show tonight? Around 10"
":00? "
"Roz: It's okay, Bulldog, he knows. "
"Frasier: Yes. But high marks on that cryptic cover story. "
"Bulldog: I've gotta make a call. Station manager's been calling me all day. Oh, I made us a reservation. Thought maybe we could get a little dinner first. "
"Roz: You mean... eat together? "
"Bulldog: Yeah. I'll be right back. "
"Frasier: Oh, that's beautiful, Roz. "
"Roz: Oh God, this ruins everything "
"Frasier: What? "
"Roz: Well, didn't you hear what he said? He wants to buy me dinner. Do you realize what this means? "
"Frasier: They finally opened that new Hooters out by the airport? "
"Roz: No. He's crossed the line. He actually thinks we're dating "
"Frasier: Roz, didn't your mother warn you that sex could lead to things like dating? "
"Roz: Look, that is it. I'm going to put an end to this before it goes too far. "
"Bulldog: I don't believe it. They just fired me. "
"Frasier: What? "
"Bulldog: Yeah. They said my ratings are low, the show's losing its edge, I'm getting soft. My last day's Friday. "
"Frasier: Oh, Bulldog, I'm so sorry. Are you all right? "
"Bulldog: No, I'm not. This stinks. This is total B.S. You don't think I'm getting soft, do you? "
"Frasier: No, no, not at all. Here. "
"Bulldog: I just thank God I got a girlfriend like you, Roz. I don't think I can face this alone. "
"Roz: There, there. "
"Frasier: Daphne Morning, Dad. "
"Martin: Hey. "
"Daphne: Yes? "
"Frasier: Daphne, please. Donny's not here. Will you just take your hand out of the bag? "
"Frasier: I was just undressing to take my bath, when I sat on the edge of the tub and landed... on this. "
"Daphne: Oh my God, you found my ring I'd given up, I thought it was someplace I'd never find it "
"Frasier: It very nearly was. "
"Daphne: Come on, let me have it. "
"Frasier: No, no, no, you go rinse off this doodle dust first. "
"Daphne: Oh, right, yes. "
"Martin: Well, you sure saved Daphne there. "
"Frasier: Yes, and I also did myself a little favor as well. Can you imagine what conclusions Faye might have jumped to had she found this engagement ring in my room? "
"Faye: Oh, Frasier, for me? I had no idea "
"Frasier: Well, actually, uh... "
"Faye: It's beautiful It's so beautiful Yes, Frasier, I do I do "
"Faye: Oh, calm down, you big dope. I know it's Daphne's ring. "
"Faye: And, uh, I can't tell you how flattered I am by those beads of sweat on your forehead. "
"Frasier: Well, they're love beads, honey Oh God, will you take this thing? "
"Martin: Well, I don't want it What if Bonnie sees me with it? "
"Bonnie: Sees you with what? "
"Martin: Daphne, will you come in here and take this damn ring, please? "
"Daphne: Coming "
"Martin: Sit down and have a little coffee. "
"Donny: Good morning, everybody Another full house, I see. "
"Frasier: Yes, and that robe is available for purchase in the gift shop. "
"Donny: Hi. Oh, you found your ring "
"Daphne: What? You knew it was gone? "
"Donny: Well, Daphne, when your fiancée gives you a hug with a chicken on her hand, then bells go off. "
"Daphne: I'm sorry- "
"Donny: Oh, that's okay, honey. You know, I didn't want to say anything because I knew it would turn up sooner or later, and I didn't want to make you feel worse. "
"Frasier: As long as we're tying up loose ends here, I was just wondering, what was your ring doing on the edge of my Jacuzzi tub, right next to my favorite scented candle – which was burned down to the wick? "
"Daphne: I'm going to let my attorney handle this one. "
"Donny: I'm sorry, Frasier. I guess after a little champagne we got into the mood, and into the nude, and into the tub. But don't worry, we'll replace the candle. "
"Frasier: If only you could replace the image. Next time, if you don't mind, will you just turn down the temperature a little? "
"Donny: Actually, we tried, but the knob was stuck. "
"Bonnie: Yeah, it does that. You gotta jiggle it a little. "
"Martin: Don't worry, it's not what you think We use it to give Eddie a bath. "
"Martin: Oh, hi, guys "
"Kit: Good morning "
"Frasier: Well, you're up early. "
"Niles: You mean still up. We never went to bed. "
"Kit: We'll get there "
"Martin: What did you do all night? "
"Niles: Oh, what didn't we do? We started off at a concert, wonderful group called Uncle Dirtnap. Then we danced the night away at every club in the U district before finding ourselves at an after-party at Kit's friend Massimo's place. He's a squatter. Anyway, I wanted to give Kit the keys to my building and I remembered I have a spare set here, so I thought we'd pop by. "
"Frasier: Oh, well then, let me get them for you. I can offer you a pastry, courtesy of Le Cigare Volant. "
"Kit: Oh, no thanks. You know, those things are loaded with bleached flour. That stuff's poison. "
"Kit: Oh, Niles, give me your cell phone. I'll call the travel agent. "
"Martin: You going on a trip? "
"Kit: Yeah, he's taking me to France for the weekend. Euro-Disney "
"Niles: Massimo said we just had to go. Apparently it is so lame, it's cool. "
"Faye: Well, I should get going. Places to go, people to poison. "
"Bonnie: I should get going too. I'll pick up Lady and meet you and Eddie at the park at 10"
":30? "
"Martin: Better make it 11"
":00. "
"Niles: Frasier, isn't she great? "
"Frasier: Oh, yes. "
"Niles: She's so free, so spontaneous. She has breathed new life into me. "
"Frasier: You may have to return the favor. "
"Niles: Am I detecting disapproval? "
"Frasier: No, Niles, not at all, just... Well, all right. Don't you think you two are going just a bit quickly? "
"Niles: Oh, for the past year you have told me I had to get over Daphne, find someone else. Now I do and all you can do is find fault. Man, you are such a buzz kill. "
"Frasier: Will you stop talking like that? I'm just a little concerned, Niles. You met this girl last week, she's spent every night with you, now you're giving her the keys to your apartment? "
"Niles: I think you're just jealous. "
"Frasier: Jealous? "
"Niles: Yes. Here I have attracted this untamed, free spirit, and you're saddled with an uptight pastry chef whose name you can't even remember. "
"Frasier: Her name is Faye And I am not jealous, I'm just a little worried about you. I'm afraid you might get hurt. "
"Niles: Oh. Here we go. Whatever would I do, without my wise older brother to tell me what to do? "
"Frasier: Well, frankly, you couldn't be acting more like a child. You think I don't know the real reason you came over here? It wasn't to get your keys, it was to show off Lolita's kid sister out there. The two of you have absolutely nothing in common. "
"Kit: Well, we're all set for Euro-Disney "
"Niles: Great. You ready to go home? "
"Kit: Oh, sure. Bye, Frasier. "
"Frasier: Bye. "
"Kit: Oh, I'm so excited for this trip I'm going to spend all my time at Fantasy Land. "
"Frasier: Oh, Niles? I'm sorry, I take it back. You do have something in common. "
"Frasier: Isn't that a darling sight? Time was when a waitress said, 'Can I warm that up for you?' she was talking about your coffee. How was your date with Bulldog last night? "
"Roz: Hideous. He took me to a nice restaurant, he brought me flowers, and then we went back to his place and cuddled. All I could think of the whole time was, 'How do I dump this loser?' "
"Frasier: Oh, Roz... "
"Roz: He's meeting me here for coffee and I'm ending this thing once and for all. "
"Frasier: Yeah, well, good luck getting a cup of coffee. You know, it's the funniest thing. He really does look happy, doesn't he? "
"Roz: Yeah, so just leave it alone. "
"Frasier: Maybe you're right. Do you realize that this is the first time in recent history that all three Crane men have been in happy relationships? Maybe I should be celebrating that fact rather than being such a buzz kill. "
"Roz: What does that mean? "
"Frasier: Oh, Roz, plug in. Hi, honey, it's Frasier. Listen, I just read a marvelous review of this charming boite out in Freemont and I thought to myself, 'that is a place that Cassandra would just love,' so- "
"Roz: Frasier "
"Frasier: Not now, Roz, please. "
"Roz: You just called her Cassandra "
"Frasier: My producer Roz informs me that I just called you Cassandra. I'm sorry, I don't know why I keep doing this. I know that you're Faye. Fabulous Faye Forever Faye Call me, Faye. It is one syllable What the hell is wrong with me? "
"Frasier: Well, I'm glad to see that you think it's funny. "
"Roz: No, I don't, I just... I'm having a flashback to my summer of Ted, Todd, and Tad. "
"Bulldog: Hey, sports fans "
"Frasier: Oh, uh, Bulldog, hi. You know what? You may have my seat. I'm going to sit over there. "
"Bulldog: All right. Hey, gorgeous. "
"Roz: Look, Bulldog, you and I need to talk about what's been going on between us. "
"Bulldog: I know. "
"Roz: We're in public "
"Bulldog: Look. I want to tell you what's going on in here, okay? "
"Roz: Bulldog, I don't want to know-- "
"Bulldog: Roz, I've gotta be honest with you. This past week has been amazing, but... I met a total babe at unemployment this morning and we're going to Hawaii this afternoon. "
"Roz: What? "
"Bulldog: I know, I know. Getting dumped - ouch. It hurts like hell. "
"Roz: No, I don't believe this I came here to dump you "
"Bulldog: Hey, whatever you gotta say to get through this, it's okay with me. "
"Roz: But- "
"Bulldog: I know, I know. I didn't mean to make you fall in love with me. "
"Roz: I didn't You repulse me "
"Bulldog: Hey, love hurts, Roz. And I'm not talking about the time we fell off the kitchen table. Aloha, old friend. "
"Roz: Bulldog, you cuddle lousy and I'm glad you got fired "
"Noel: Well, timing is everything. "
"Roz: Back off, buzz kill "
"Martin: Hi, Frasier. "
"Frasier: Oh, hey, Dad. "
"Martin: Black coffee to go, please. "
"Frasier: You okay? "
"Martin: I just broke it off with Bonnie. "
"Frasier: Oh, gee. I'm so sorry. What happened? "
"Martin: Lady humped Eddie. "
"Frasier: Excuse me? "
"Martin: You heard me. It was humiliating. "
"Frasier: But Eddie's a boy dog and Lady's a... well, a lady. "
"Martin: Yes, well, that would be the humiliating part, now wouldn't it? Right in his own park in front of all those other dogs. Yeah, Bonnie got a big kick out of it, too. "
"Frasier: Sorry. "
"Martin: I told her off and that was it. "
"Frasier: I'm sorry, Dad. "
"Martin: It's not funny. "
"Frasier: I know, I know, I know. Was he wearing a hat? "
"Frasier: No, Dad, please, come back... "
"Faye: Hi, Martin. "
"Martin: Hey, Faye. "
"Frasier: Hi, honey. "
"Faye: Hi. I was near the station so I just thought I'd see if you were around. "
"Frasier: Oh, great. Oh, Roz, you remember... Faye "
"Roz: Hi, Faye. "
"Faye: You were going to say Cassandra, weren't you? "
"Frasier: No, no. Why would you think such a thing? "
"Faye: Well, for one, I just checked my messages. "
"Frasier: Oh, I'm so sorry. I don't know why it keeps happening. You just have this remarkable resemblance to- "
"Faye: I know, I know. Your aunt. I'll be right back. "
"Frasier: I have got to stop saying Cassandra "
"Cassandra: Frasier "
"Frasier: Cassandra "
"Roz: Hi, Cassandra. "
"Frasier: So, how've you been? "
"Cassandra: Great. Actually I've been wanting to talk to you for a while. We've been sort of... avoiding each other at work and it just all seems so silly. I mean, I really don't have any hard feelings about the way things ended between us. "
"Frasier: Oh, well, that's wonderful. Neither do I. "
"Cassandra: You dumped me. You're not allowed to have hard feelings. Anyway, my life is great. I'm back together with Sloan. You know, you and I should have coffee together sometime. "
"Frasier: That'd be nice, yes. "
"Cassandra: I'm just glad we're putting all this awkwardness behind us. "
"Frasier: Me, too. "
"Cassandra: Ouch "
"Faye: Hello. "
"Cassandra: Hello. "
"Frasier: Well... "
"Roz: Whoa I've gotta get back to work. Going back to the station? "
"Cassandra: Uh, yes... "
"Roz: Good, I'll walk with you. Oh my God, look at the time. We've got to hurry. Bye, Faye. Bye Frasier. "
"Frasier: Bye-bye. Love you. "
"Roz: Yes, you do "
"Faye: Who was that? "
"Frasier: You know Roz. "
"Faye: No, the other one. "
"Frasier: Oh, she's the, um, promotions director. "
"Faye: Well, she's gorgeous. Don't you think so? "
"Frasier: I don't know, I never really looked. "
"Faye: Well, don't start looking now. If I'm going to stay I should feed the meter. "
"Frasier: Lucky meter. "
"Niles: Hey there, Frasier. "
"Frasier: Oh, Niles, hi. Listen, Niles, I want to apologize for getting upset this morning. I've been giving it some thought and I think maybe Kit is just what the doctor ordered. "
"Niles: Is she ever "
"Frasier: And no strings? Just fun, right? That's what she says. "
"Niles: Exactly. So, you really like her? "
"Frasier: Yes, I do. "
"Niles: And you're not just saying that? "
"Frasier: Absolutely not. "
"Niles: You want her? "
"Frasier: Excuse me? "
"Niles: Frasier, she's killing me. I'm just not cut out for this lifestyle. Between seeing myself in a mirror at the club dancing my modified Charleston, and then catching my reflection in the store window this morning as I Rollerbladed past in spandex, I feel like I'm being stalked by some pathetic middle-aged ghoul. Obviously, I've got to break it off with her. "
"Frasier: Oh, gosh. I'm so sorry, Niles. You going to tell her now? "
"Niles: No, I'll arrange to meet her after work. To tell you the truth, I think she's losing interest herself. I couldn't help noticing a little eye-rolling today when my skate wheel got stuck in a storm grate. And... thanks for not saying 'I told you so.' "
"Niles: Hey, Kit, there's something I wanted to talk to you about later. "
"Kit: Just talk to me now. You know you can tell me anything. "
"Niles: No, I'd rather do it after your shift. "
"Kit: You have such a serious face. What, are we breaking up or something? "
"Niles: Well... "
"Kit: Oh my God You just dumped me? Right here where I work in front of everyone I wait on? "
"Niles: That's okay, we'll go outside. "
"Kit: Give me an answer "
"Niles: Kit, Kit, calm down- "
"Kit: You're tired of me? Is that what it is? "
"Niles: It's all right- "
"Kit: You've had enough of me? I gave you everything and you used me Sex, sex, sex The way you come to bed every night - wanting it, begging for it "
"Niles: I never had to beg "
"Kit: I'm just a whore to you, aren't I? "
"Niles: No, don't say that "
"Kit: That's all I am, your whore Your whore from the café "
"Niles: It's really more of a compatibility thing. I'm recently divorced and I've been under a lot of strain... "
"Niles: It's been very painful for everyone... "
"Frasier: Niles, they're strangers. It's all right, Niles. Let's just pick this up, shall we? "
"Faye: What happened? "
"Frasier: I'm not really sure, actually. Just give me a minute, will you? "
"Cassandra: Excuse me, is Frasier still here? I just had something I needed to ask him. "
"Faye: Oh, yeah, he's over there. I didn't get a chance to meet you before. I'm Faye. "
"Cassandra: Oh, how do you do? I'm... "
"Frasier: NOOOO "
"Frasier: You know, this is a charming little place. I live right around the corner but I've never been in before. "
"Bartender: What'll it be? "
"Frasier: Martini, straight up, two olives - henceforth known as 'the usual.' "
"Niles: Hey. "
"Frasier: Niles "
"Niles: I called Daphne. She said you'd be here. "
"Frasier: Oh, yeah. "
"Niles: Cozy room. I guess it'll have to do, because the old whoremonger won't be going back to Nervosa anytime soon. "
"Frasier: Yeah. I'm pretty much exiled from Le Cigar Volant with Faye working there. "
"Frasier: Thank you. "
"Niles: Well, I plan to get stinkin' tonight. May I see your wine list? "
"Martin: Hey, guys. "
"Frasier: Dad What are you doing here? "
"Martin: I saw Niles's car outside, so I thought I'd stop in for a drink. I can't go to McGinty's anymore with Bonnie there, and Eddie's taking a break from the park. "
"Frasier: Well, come join us here on Elba. "
"Bartender: What can I get you? "
"Martin: Jameson's on the rocks. "
"Niles: And I'll try the... white. "
"Niles: Well, here we are again - losers in love. "
"Frasier: Yeah. I don't know what's wrong with me. I seem incapable of maintaining a relationship. I date a nice girl like Faye, things seem to be working out, and I seem to find a way to blow it. It seems to be the pattern of my life. Well, except with Lilith. She was just nuts. "
"Niles: At least you take your time. I don't date, I leap. Headfirst. Thank you. More often than not I get my heart broken - by Maris... [sipping the wine and grimacing at its flavor] By Daphne, even if she didn't know it. At least Kit only broke my box spring. "
"Frasier: All I can conclude is that I must have some deeper issues with women that manifest themselves in my behavior. The trick is to pinpoint them. "
"Niles: Well, you know what I'm thinking? I'm thinking of taking some time off and going into deep analysis. "
"Frasier: That's not a bad idea, Niles. Stephen Bachman is at the absolute pinnacle of psychodynamic research. Perhaps we should see him. "
"Niles: If we went in together we could get a rate. "
"Frasier: Yeah. Shouldn't take more than a year or so... "
"Niles: I think that's optimistic... "
"Martin: Jeez, how do you guys get up in the morning? You want to go into deep analysis? Listen to me, I'm your father. There's nothing wrong with either one of you. You dump a woman but you can't get her off your mind, so you end up getting dumped by the other one. And you should have stayed with the first one anyway, she was hotter. And you? You're just learning how to date. I mean, it would have been nice if it had happened 25 years ago, but you play the cards you're dealt. Me? I like Bonnie, Bonnie's dog humps Eddie, I don't like Bonnie anymore. It doesn't mean I have 'issues with women,' it's just life, you know? Good stuff happens and bad stuff happens, that's all. You've just gotta look on the bright side. It's like that old song - 'You Gotta Accentuate the Positive.' "
"Frasier: Maybe Dad's right. We do tend to over-analyze things. "
"Martin: Hey. I got an idea. Let's go over here. Let's do a little singing. "
"Niles: Dad... "
"Martin: Hey, buddy, can you play 'Accentuate the Positive'? "
"Jack: Oh, no, I'm just noodling around. The real pianist doesn't come till 9"
":00. "
"Martin: Well, you can fake it, can't you? "
"Jack: Well no, not really. I actually only know three songs – 'America the Beautiful,' 'Happy Birthday' and 'Goldfinger.' "
"Frasier: That's all right, buddy- "
"Martin: No, come on guys, we were gonna sing a happy song, let's sing a happy song. Uh, play 'Goldfinger.' "
"Niles: We don't know the words to that. "
"Martin: Oh, come on, you knew it when you were kids It'll cheer you up, come on. Hit it. "
"Jack: Weh-weh-weh, Weh-weh-weh... "
"Martin: Goldfinger... "
"All: 'Goldfinger' "
"Martin: He's the man, the man with the Midas touch. "
"All: 'He's the man, the man with the Midas touch...' "
"Martin: A spider's touch. "
"All: 'A spider's touch...' "
"Martin: Such a cold finger. "
"Frasier: Dad, this is ridiculous. "
"Martin: Oh, come on, sing it "
"All: 'Such a cold finger... 'Beckons you to enter his web of sin...' "
"Martin: That's it "
"All: 'But don't go in' "

"Skyline: Above the Seattle skyline flies a plane trailing behind "
"Frasier: This is exactly why I hate fix-ups, she's not coming. "
"Roz: Just give her a few more minutes. Come on, tell me about the cabin. "
"Frasier: Oh, all right. Well, Mom and Dad used to take us up there when we were kids. Niles and I thought it might be a nice birthday gift for Dad if we took him up there again. Oh, this is ridiculous I'm being stood up on a blind date - I'm pathetic. "
"Roz: You are so insecure. God Where does that come from? Jessica will be here. "
"Frasier: Jessica? I thought you said her name was Jennifer. "
"Roz: Jennifer? Jennifer goes out with a weatherman. She's way out of your league. Look, let me you have your cell phone. I'll call her and see what's going on. "
"Roz: Frasier "
"Frasier: Oh, I'm sorry Roz, the most striking woman just came in. "
"Roz: It's probably Jessica. "
"Frasier: No, no, no, it's not Jessica. She's with a man. God, I don't know what it is about her. I can't take my eyes off of her. Do you suppose they're a couple? "
"Frasier: Tell you what, you have to go over there for me and find out. "
"Roz: What? "
"Frasier: You owe me. Come on. All right, it's the table right by the counter. Go on. "
"Frasier: No, Roz, Roz- "
"Roz: Excuse me, I know this is a little weird. But my friend over there thinks you're really, really cute. And he wants to know if you two are on a date. "
"Francesca: A date? Oh no, Hank and I are just friends. "
"Roz: Oh, that's good news. [Hank turns round and Roz notices him] That's REALLY good news. Hi, Hank. I'm Roz Doyle. "
"Frasier: Excuse me, ah. I suppose you noticed I was staring at your table and I was just wondering if that gentleman you're with - is he your husband? "
"Mia: No. "
"Frasier: Boyfriend? "
"Mia: No. "
"Frasier: Oh, wonderful. "
"Mia: Would you like me to introduce you, he just broke up with someone. "
"Frasier: No... I was staring at you. "
"Mia: You were? "
"Frasier: Yes. Gosh, I know this may seem awfully bold of me, I'm not the sort of man who hits on every woman he sees. "
"Francesca: Excuse me, hi, your friend said you wanted to know if I was single. It's okay, you don't have to be embarrassed. "
"Mia: Yes, he does. "
"Frasier: There's been a little mistake. You see, I asked my friend to approach this lovely woman and she obviously mistook you for the woman I meant. Well, that's certainly understandable, seeing as you're lovely as well. Well, it's just that at this moment, well... Gosh, I'm sorry, let me start again. I'm Frasier Crane. "
"Jessica: Oh, you're Frasier. Hi, I'm Jessica - Roz's friend. "
"Frasier: Jessica. "
"Jessica: Roz thought we might hit it off. "
"Frasier: Indeed we might have, you see, if not for the fact I just met this woman, to whom I'd be to glad to introduce you, except I don't know what her name is. You know, Roz can explain all this. She's sitting over there next to that scowling woman. "
"Frasier: Gosh, you know, you must think I'm some sort of a smooth operator. "
"Mia: No, not really. "
"Frasier: I really am terribly sorry. Ah... "
"Mia: I'm Mia. Mia Preston. "
"Frasier: Mia. Mia Preston? The children's book author? "
"Mia: Yes. "
"Frasier: Oh my goodness. 'Panda in the Parlor.' Oh, wow I love that book, I've read it a hundred times. "
"Mia: I'm impressed. Most of my readers can't even count that high. "
"Frasier: No, I used to read it to my son. You know, many is the quart of milk we've poured in the back yard waiting for the Oreo Tree to grow. Gosh, you know I'd love to take you to lunch, sometime. "
"Mia: Lunch? Em... I... "
"Frasier: Well, all right, coffee? Anything. I'd just like a chance to get you know you better. "
"Mia: Well, okay. You're certainly persistent. "
"Frasier: Well, as a wise woman once wrote, 'No cookie jar is up too high for a panda who will try and try.' "
"Mia: Now you're scaring me. "
"Martin: Hey, Daph. "
"Daphne: I see you're wearing your buffet pants. "
"Martin: They're hip-waders. I'm breaking them in for the weekend. Where's Fras? "
"Daphne: He's probably off somewhere with that Mia. "
"Martin: Oh yeah, it seems to be getting serious, huh? You know, it's funny, you can always tell. He starts using French words for no reason. "
"Daphne: Yeah, and that laugh, the giddy one. "
"Niles: Hello, all. Well, there's a faux-pas averted. I almost wore my big rubber pants today "
"Martin: They're for the trip. I'm nearly done packing. I just gotta get my fly mast and my tackle box and there's one more thing... "
"Frasier: Yes, well, we're taking off in a few hours so depeché-toi "
"Martin: Oh yeah, earplugs for the car ride up. Thanks. "
"Niles: Oh but Dad, don't forgot to pack some sturdy knee socks. "
"Niles: I should get some for myself. You remember the insect situation at the cabin. "
"Frasier: Good Lord, Niles, not this bug phobia of yours. "
"Niles: It's not a phobia. The mosquitoes up there are huge. My first summer I was chased off the end of the dock by one the size of a pelican "
"Daphne: So, Dr. Crane, when do we finally get to meet this new girlfriend of yours? "
"Frasier: Oh, Mia, she's on her way over right now, actually. She's going to take me out to buy some new trousers. You see, with this new diet she's got me on, I've lost my love handles. Just when I needed them most. "
"Frasier: Niles, Niles, you got those movies? "
"Niles: Shush, here they are. "
"Daphne: Movies? "
"Niles: Shush. Yes, for Dad's birthday we had some old home movies transferred to video tape. "
"Frasier: Gosh, you know, I haven't seen these in years. You know, Daphne, it's going to be quite a hoot this weekend. Are you sure you don't want to join us? "
"Daphne: Gutting fish, watching home movies and hosing down your father's pants. It does sound tempting "
"Mia: Hi, honey. "
"Frasier: Hi, Mia. And my brother Niles. "
"Mia: It's great to finally meet you two. "
"Daphne: Likewise. "
"Frasier: So, what you got there? "
"Mia: Oh, I baked some fat-free goodies for your trip. Oh, where's the kitchen? "
"Frasier: Right this way. "
"Mia: And there's a ton of muffins if anybody wants one. "
"Niles: Oh, not for me, I have some problems with allergies. "
"Mia: Really? Well these are just wheat germ, oat bran and carob. "
"Niles: Oh well, throw in a sea scallop, you can phone the paramedics right now. "
"Daphne: She seems nice, doesn't she? You all right, Dr. Crane? "
"Niles: I'm sorry, Daphne, it's just that Mia looks exactly like our mother. "
"Daphne: Mrs. Crane? I've only seen photos, mind, but now that you mention it, there is a resemblance. "
"Niles: It's not just a resemblance. She's the spitting image, I'm shocked Frasier didn't mention it. "
"Frasier: So, what do you think of her? "
"Niles: Well she's wonderful, but Frasier... "
"Niles: Does she remind you of anyone? "
"Frasier: Oh, you noticed that too. "
"Niles: Are you kidding? The minute I laid eyes on her. "
"Daphne: Even I can see it. "
"Frasier: Really? Well, she does look a bit like Roz, but she's a totally different person. You know, in fact our relationship is unlike any I've ever had before. "
"Mia: Come on, handsome. Let's go buy you some pants "
"Frasier: Oh, okay "
"Martin: Oh, wow Look at that. I don't believe it. Nothing's changed. Niles "
"Niles: Wow I don't believe it Look at this Nothing's changed "
"Martin: It's character, Niles. Look at this fireplace. Your mom and I used to sit in front of the fire here holding hands. I wonder if that... Oh, yeah It's still here. That graffiti that you scratched into the floor. "
"Niles: That's not graffiti, Dad, that's a Latin pun. 'Semper Ubi Sub Ubi' - 'Always Where Under Where' "
"Niles: Oh, that'll be Frasier and Mia. "
"Martin: Yeah, I was really surprised he brought her here for the weekend. What's she like, anyway? "
"Niles: Uh, well, she made quite an impression on me. I'm curious to see what you'll think. "
"Niles: Dad, would you hand me that valise, I want to put on some bug repellent. "
"Martin: Oh, sure Ooh, it's kind of heavy. What you got in there? "
"Niles: Bug repellent "
"Frasier: Hello, Niles. "
"Niles: Hey, Frasier. "
"Frasier: Honey, you stay out there as long as you like. She can't take her eyes off that sunset. Is everything all set here? "
"Niles: Yes, I just want to make sure this VCR works for our little home movies, later. Check. "
"Frasier: Splendid. Niles, you know what, we're going to need some more logs from the wood pile. Come give me a hand. "
"Niles: All right. "
"Martin: Fras, isn't it great to be back here? You know, I want to thank you guys, this is some gift. "
"Frasier: You're welcome, Dad. Listen, if you're enjoying this little trip down memory lane, wait until you see the other blast from the past we brought up here. "
"Mia: Martin? Hi. "
"Mia: It's Mia. Oh my gosh, Frasier did tell you I was coming, didn't he? "
"Martin: Oh, yeah. Of course he did. Yeah, well, nice meeting you. "
"Mia: It's very nice to meet you. Well, it's so beautiful here. "
"Martin: I'm glad you like it. "
"Mia: Are you kidding? I feel like I'm in heaven. "
"Martin: I'm starting to feel that way myself. "
"Frasier: Well, nice going, Niles "
"Mia: What happened? "
"Frasier: Niles dropped a huge log right onto my hand when he was startled by a moth. "
"Niles: It was not a moth, it was a bat. I could tell from that eerie high-pitched scream. "
"Frasier: That was you Look, frankly, I wish you'd start seeing someone about this bug phobia of yours. "
"Niles: It is not a phobia. I have a healthy fear of our natural predators. It's us versus them, and frankly I'm starting to wonder just whose side you're on. "
"Frasier: It just amazes me that a good psychiatrist can be so blind of something so obvious. "
"Mia: Oh honey, your poor thumb, we should put something on that. "
"Frasier: You know, okay. "
"Martin: God, she looks just like your mother. "
"Niles: I know, and Frasier doesn't see it. "
"Martin: You're kidding? "
"Niles: No, and he has the gall to tell me I'm blind. He's clearly the one dealing with repressed material, not to mention the obvious Oedipal issues. "
"Martin: Argle, gargle, gooble, goop. "
"Niles: What? "
"Martin: Now you know how it feels, what are you talking about? "
"Niles: I'm talking about Freud's theory of the 'Oedipus Complex.' He believed that every man subconsciously wants to sleep with his mother and kill his father. It's modeled on the Greek tragedy of Oedipus, who actually did sleep with his mother and kill his father, and when he realized what he'd done he gouged out both his eyes. "
"Martin: Probably not too tough to pick that guy out of a line-up. "
"Niles: Oh, why don't we just send out engraved invitations for all the bugs of the forest? The question "
"is: how do we bring it to Frasier's attention? "
"Martin: We don't "
"Niles: Dad, denial of this magnitude is not healthy, it's for his own good. "
"Martin: No, Niles. "
"Niles: Okay, it's for my own good. Come on, after the way he wagged his finger at me, you can't expect I'm just going to keep quiet about this. "
"Martin: Look, the last thing I want on my birthday weekend is some big long drawn-out argument between you two, all right? Now let's just chill this beer that we brought, all right, and just put all these weird thoughts out of our minds. "
"Niles: Fine. "
"Frasier: Oh, sorry, Dad. Come on, hon. Let's go see if our room still has that big creaky old pine bed that Mom and Dad used to sleep in. A-ha Yeah, there she is "
"Martin: Well, a guess a warm one wouldn't kill us. "
"TO: "
"Martin: Boy, being in this place really takes me back. Remember that summer I tried to teach you boys how to fish? You just didn't have the knack, so I went out and I bought these two big trout and snuck 'em on the boat. "
"Mia: Oh, Marty, you're terrible "
"Martin: Yeah, and then I put the trout on their hooks and I dropped them over the side while you two were still arguing about the last Dramamine. I felt bad about fooling ya', but hell, what's the harm of a little fantasy if it makes you feel good? "
"Mia: More wine? "
"Martin: Oh thanks, hon. "
"Mia: Frasier, you've hardly touched your chicken. Is something wrong? "
"Frasier: Oh, no, no, it's just that, well, I'm having a little trouble holding the knife because someone dropped a log on my thumb. "
"Niles: Oh, it didn't hurt you that badly, you are such a baby. "
"Frasier: No, you are a baby, running and screaming because of a little moth. "
"Niles: I told you it was a bat "
"Martin: All right boys, that's enough. Not at the table. "
"Mia: Your father's right. "
"Mia: Now Frasier, if your hands hurting, I'll cut your meat for you. "
"Frasier: Well, all right. "
"Frasier: You know Niles, not to dwell on this, but you know, I could give you the number of a man who specializes in bug phobias. "
"Niles: Oh is that so... "
"Frasier: And while you're at it, I think you should talk to him about your constant chair dusting, I believe that is related. "
"Martin: Frasier "
"Frasier: Well, I'm sorry, Dad, I think a good psychiatrist should be self-aware. "
"Mia: Open wide "
"Niles: So you're saying I lack self-awareness? "
"Martin: Why don't we change the subject, all right? This is a great meal, Mia. "
"Niles: It certainly was. Frasier, when it comes to girlfriends, you've certainly struck the MOTHERload. "
"Martin: Niles "
"Frasier: You haven't even read her books yet, Dad, it's a delightful series about an adventurous little panda. "
"Niles: It sounds worthy of MOTHER Goose "
"Martin: So, what's coming up next week, Mia? "
"Mia: Well, I'll have to swear you to secrecy. "
"Martin: All right. "
"Mia: It looks like that Panda might just find its way into the attic. "
"Niles: Yes, MUM's the word. "
"Martin: Oh, sorry, Niles. Would you maybe come into the kitchen and I'll just help you get dried off in there, all right? "
"Niles: Yes, oh dear, it looks like these pants may have to be REPRESSED "
"Martin: What the hell's the matter with you? "
"Niles: Oh, I'm sorry Dad, you can't expect me to let him sit there in his booster seat and tell me I lack self-awareness. "
"Martin: He'll pick up on what you're saying. Do you want the whole thing to blow up? "
"Niles: Dad, this level of denial is unhealthy. "
"Martin: We're not in denial Everything's perfect This is the best birthday I've ever had "
"Mia: I know it's early, but I'm exhausted. "
"Martin: Oh Mia, you go, you hit the sack, thanks for dinner. "
"Frasier: I'll be along in a minute. "
"Niles: Frasier, before you turn in, there's a little something we need to deal with. "
"Martin: Oh, Jeez. "
"Frasier: Oh right, Dad, your birthday gift. "
"Martin: Oh yes, my gift, my gift, I want to open my gift. It's my birthday this weekend, right? "
"Frasier: Come on Niles. It'll be fun, come on. "
"Niles: Oh yes, fine "
"Frasier: Oh come on, seeing you and me, Dad and Mom? "
"Niles: You know, I'm getting more excited by the second. "
"Frasier: Okay, Dad, now listen, you sit right here. "
"Martin: Oh right, okay, what is this? Some kind of movie? "
"Frasier: That's right. Here we go. "
"Martin: Oh, my old home movies. I haven't seen these for twenty years. "
"Frasier: Well, happy birthday, Dad, now you can watch them whenever you like. Isn't it just the reaction you were hoping for? "
"Niles: One of them. "
"Frasier: Oh, dear God Do you two see what I see? My God, they could be twins. "
"Martin: Now Frasier, take it easy... "
"Frasier: You do see it? How could you miss it? How could I miss it? "
"Martin: Niles, just calm him down and I'll get him a drink of water. "
"Niles: Frasier, Frasier, the important thing is not to blow this out of proportion. After all... "
"Niles: Dear God, what was that, a hummingbird? "
"Frasier: What is the matter with me? "
"Niles: Now Frasier, you didn't do anything wrong, your feelings for Mia stem from perfectly natural Oedipal desires. "
"Frasier: Yes, but Oedipal desires are supposed to resolve themselves by the age of six "
"Frasier: Oh for God's sake, give me that, you idiot "
"Frasier: I've blinded myself "
"Martin: I leave you alone with him for two seconds... "
"Niles: Frasier, are you all right? "
"Frasier: Let me just try to calm down a little bit. She's not my mother. "
"gave: "
"Mia: Frasier, come to bed. "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Hello? You wanted to see me? "
"Mia: I hope I wasn't rushing you. "
"Frasier: No, no, it is bedtime. "
"Mia: Are you okay sweetie? You seem a little tense. "
"Frasier: No, no, no, I just need to calm down a little bit. [sits rigidly on bed] Yeah, you see, that's better. "
"Mia: It seems like you're in pain. Oh, it's your hand. "
"Frasier: Yes, yes, that's it. "
"Mia: Well, I know what the problem is there. I never kissed your little boo-boo. "
"Mia: We don't want these other fingers to be jealous, do we? "
"Mia: Frasier, honey, please. "
"Mia: Tell me what's wrong. What's bothering you? "
"Frasier: I'm sorry, I don't know what's wrong with me, I'm just having a little trouble getting comfortable. "
"Mia: Well, was it something I did, something I said at dinner, what? "
"Frasier: Okay, okay. Gosh, this is awkward. I just realized that you bear a striking resemblance to my mother. "
"Mia: But you just noticed it now? "
"Frasier: Yes. "
"Mia: Well, it can't be that strong of a resemblance then, can it? That strong, huh? Well listen, I hope you can get over it, because I think we have a pretty great thing going here. Don't you? "
"Frasier: Yes. "
"Mia: We have loads in common, we get along great and don't you want to stick around long enough to see how that naughty Panda gets out of the attic? "
"Frasier: Oh, I do, yes. You're right, just talking about this makes me feel much better. Oh, God, you're not my mother, this is ridiculous. "
"Mia: So, you're okay. "
"Frasier: I'm okay. "
"Frasier: I'm better than okay. "
"Mia: Okay, then. "
"Frasier: Oh well, there's your cab. "
"Mia: Take care of yourself. "
"Frasier: Yeah. I'm sorry, this is so awkward. "
"Mia: No really, it's fine. "
"Martin: I take it that cab was for Mia. "
"Frasier: Yeah. You know, I tried to get past it but I just couldn't. "
"Martin: I'm sorry, son. "
"Niles: Yeah, me too, Frasier. "
"Frasier: I won't be getting much sleep tonight. "
"Martin: Well, I'm up too. "
"Niles: I won't be getting a wink of sleep either the way those crickets are raging. "
"Martin: Niles, why don't you get us all a nice big brandy? [Niles does] Now, don't make too much of this, Frasier. So you picked a woman who looked like your mother, so what? "
"Frasier: 'Like her' would have been fine, Dad. We're not talking about a similar hairdo or the same crooked smile. I was dating a replicant. "
"Martin: Now Frasier, I know you're going to go crazy convincing yourself that you've got some big complex, but couldn't it be simpler than that? Maybe you just miss your mother. I know I do. "
"Frasier: I do think about her a lot. "
"Niles: We all do. "
"Martin: Hey, I think we've talked about all this enough for one night. So, it's still my birthday. I want to watch the rest of my movies. "
"Frasier: That's a great idea, Dad. "
"Niles: Check. "
"Niles: Well, there certainly are a lot of us fighting. "
"Frasier: You know, Dad, I wish there were more shots with you in it. "
"Martin: No, no, no, I liked being the cameraman. "
"Martin: I got to focus on the things I liked. "

"Roz: Oh hey, Frasier. Catalogues? "
"Frasier: Yes. I'm trying to find the perfect wedding gift for Daphne and Donny. "
"Roz: Oh, right. Well, I guess now that they've set a date, I'll be getting my bridesmaid draft notice. "
"Frasier: You know Roz, she might not even ask you. "
"Roz: Oh, she'll ask me. They all do. The next thing I know I'm wearing some revolting puffy-sleeved dress made from the same material that keeps the space shuttle from burning up on re-entry. "
"Frasier: You know, Roz, Daphne might just surprise you and pick a dress you like. "
"Roz: Oh, impossible. They're always ugly; that's why the bride makes sure she's the prettiest one at the wedding. "
"Frasier: That's awfully cynical. "
"Roz: Oh yeah, when was the last time you found yourself staring at the bridesmaid instead of the bride? "
"Frasier: That would have been at my wedding to Lilith. "
"Niles: Hello Frasier. "
"Frasier: Oh, Niles. "
"Niles: Frasier, do you remember the time the Kreizel brothers tied me to their Great Dane and lobbed meatballs down their gravel driveway? "
"Frasier: I've told you Niles, I would have helped you, but their sister was holding me down. "
"Niles: No, my point is - Cappuccino, please [to Frasier] - even that experience was less painful than the date I was just on. She was... [takes a cat hair from his jacket and puts it on the floor] ...a cat person. She brought her cat on our date. Well, she had good reason, it was Mr. Waggles's birthday. Actually his birthday party. Actually, his surprise birthday party. "
"Frasier: I'm sorry, where on earth did you meet this woman? "
"Niles: At Nordstroms. We both reached for the same cashmere throw and she said she needed something to keep her waggles warm. I thought it was a coy euphemism. [the waitress brings his coffee] Thank you. "
"Frasier: Well, Niles, I certainly understand your being upset, but you know, you've got to keep on looking. "
"Niles: Well, trust me, with Daphne getting married, I have no choice but to press on. But I'm going to change my strategy. Do you recall, the other day at the health club, Tony Hubner gave me that phone number? "
"Frasier: Dear God, Niles, not a dating service? "
"Niles: No, it's not a dating service. An 'Introduction Network' for busy professionals. I've given them my vital statistics, there's an extensive screening process, they bill me at the end of the month. "
"Frasier: Niles, please. They are all money-grubbing con-artists who prey on the pathetic and the lonely. God's sakes, you sign up with visions of some Ph.D., and what do they deliver? A buck-toothed librarian who needs help washing her mother Are you really that desperate? "
"Niles: Half an hour ago, I had my back leg tethered to Mr. Waggles's forepaw and we came in third in the five-legged race. "
"Frasier: Geez, you’d think they'd let him win on his birthday. "
"Daphne: I know, mum, but it is my wedding. I've given into you on so many things. Couldn't this one thing go my way? I just don't like those tiny corns in my salad. No, I don't hate you. Well, that's just not true. I'm glad you're alive. All right, all right, tiny corn it is. I've got to run now, cheery bye. That was mum, she had a thought about the salad. "
"Frasier: Something tells me yesterday's crouton skirmish wasn't the end of it. "
"Daphne: I suppose she can be a bit overbearing. But as she often points out, she is paying for the wedding and I am her only daughter and giving birth to me was so painful she did bite through a kitchen spoon. "
"Frasier: Daphne, just don't let you mother guilt you into having the wedding she wants instead of the wedding you want. "
"Daphne: Oh, don't worry, mum already promised me I could have the wedding I want, as soon as I have a daughter who gets engaged. "
"Frasier: Hiya, Dad. "
"Martin: Oh, Fras. You'll love this stuff I got from the farmer's market. This guy takes the juiciest cut of filet mignon, slices it real thin and makes jerky out of it. "
"Frasier: Look Dad, I don't... "
"Frasier: Yes, if only I had a nice powdered Cabernet to go with it. Listen, have you given any thought to Daphne's wedding present? "
"Martin: Now Frasier, not everyone likes jerky as much as you and me. "
"Frasier: No, I just want to get her something special, especially since her mother seems to be taking all the joy out of it for her. "
"Martin: Oh, well, how about a nice piece of luggage? You know, a good hard suitcase, like the kind people used to put stickers on to show everybody where they've been. Remember your grandad's? His whole life was on "
"it: Topeka, Sioux Falls, Biloxi... it was like a map of the world. "
"Frasier: What a loss to us all that he failed to write his memoirs. I'm thinking of something that would matter to Daphne. Oh, something that shows her how we feel. Good Lord, that's a little spicy, isn't it? [gets a bottle of water from fridge] You know, maybe we should get something for her wedding. "
"Martin: Like what? "
"Frasier: Well, I don't know, her flowers, say? That's it, we could offer to pay for her wedding flowers. "
"Martin: That's a bit pricy, isn't it? "
"Frasier: Well don't worry about it, Dad. You just donate what you can and I'll pay for the rest. God, what was in that jerky? "
"Martin: Well, you just ate it too fast. Next time you have to savor it a little. "
"Frasier: Dad, I'm never going to taste that vile stuff again. Oh, spoke too soon. "
"Frasier: Daphne, may I have a word with you, please? "
"Daphne: What is it, Dr. Crane? "
"Frasier: Well, it's about you wedding gift. Now, I know it's not traditionally the role of a friend but we consider you family, so please don't say no. Dad and I would be honoured to pay for your wedding... "
"Daphne: Pay for my wedding? "
"Frasier: "
"Daphne: How wonderful I could never imagine. "
"Martin: What's all the hubbub? "
"Daphne: Dr. Crane, just told me about your incredible wedding present. You people are heaven-sent. "
"Martin: Well, I'm glad you like it. You know what, we're going to throw in a piece of luggage as well. "
"Daphne: I'm just so overwhelmed. "
"Martin: See, I told you, everybody loves luggage. "
"Frasier: Dad, she thinks we're paying for her whole wedding. "
"Martin: What? "
"Frasier: Well, I tried to say wedding flowers, but then I hiccuped. "
"Martin: Well, I'm not paying for her wedding. "
"Frasier: Of course not, I'm just going to clear this whole thing up right now before it goes any further. Daphne "
"Daphne: You know what this means, don't you? Now that mum's not paying, she can't make me have it in England. I can have my wedding how I want it, where I want "
"it: right here. You've answered my prayers. [cries in delight and exits back to kitchen] "
"Daphne: Could someone let Donny in? "
"Martin: Well look, Donny's a very traditional guy. He's not going to let us pay for his wedding. "
"Frasier: Right, you saw how he proposed to her; on bended knee. He's nothing but a hopeless romantic. "
"saying: "
"Donny: Any idiot knows you've got to pay a hooker in cash I'm at a meeting, I'll call you later, bye. [hangs up and greets the rest] I've got this client, he's in the middle of a divorce, right, and his wife finds all these charges from this place called 'Executive Match.' It turns out to be a call girl service. When she gets through with him she'll have his house, his car, she'd have his beach house too if I hadn't already taken it. Women "
"Donny: Hi, honey. "
"Daphne: Hi sweetie. Have they told you yet? "
"Donny: Told me what? "
"Daphne: You're not going to believe this, but Dr. Crane and his father have offered to pay for our entire wedding. "
"Donny: Is this a joke? "
"Frasier: It could be. "
"Donny: I mean, it's one thing for us to let your family pay, they're your parents, it's traditional. But this is... "
"Frasier: Going too far? Being presumptuous? "
"Martin: Yeah, we don't want to step on any toes. "
"Daphne: I didn't think you'd be uncomfortable with this. "
"Frasier: Well, he clearly is, Daphne. "
"Martin: Donny's right We're not family. "
"Donny: Wait, wait, wait, what am I doing? Here you guys, you're making this lovely gesture and I'm just insulting you. I mean if you guys are not family to Daphne, then who is? Course you can pay for the wedding. Thank you, thank you. "
"Daphne: I just knew he'd see how much this meant to you. I'm tearing up again. "
"Donny: No, don't start with the water works because you're going to get me going. What's this? Jerky? Can I have some of that? "
"Martin: Help yourself. "
"Donny: Made from filet mignon. How much did this stuff set you back? "
"Frasier: You have no idea "
"Daphne: Now, as far as the reception goes, I've narrowed it down to two places. I'm leaning towards 'Captain Jonah's.' The view of the water's lovely. But you have to walk through a whale's mouth to get inside. "
"Frasier: I hesitate to ask how you exit. "
"Daphne: I've got to run. I've a meeting with the DJ. "
"Roz: I thought she'd never leave "
"Frasier: Good God, Roz, how long have you been there? "
"Roz: Since you two walked in and trapped me. "
"Frasier: Aren't you taking this a bit too far just trying to avoid an unflattering dress? "
"Roz: Yeah, I thought you'd say that. That's why I've been carrying around this picture of the last time I was a bridesmaid. "
"Frasier: Good Lord, Roz, you look like you've been tented for termites. "
"Roz: Well, it sounds like she's having fun planning her wedding. "
"Frasier: Yes, well, now that she can have things her way and not her mother's. "
"Roz: She's lucky you came along. "
"Frasier: Well, yes and no. You know, I sit here and let her make questionable choices and I say nothing because I know it's going to cost me less. I'm sorry, I've got to change my thinking about this whole thing. What good is my money, if I'm denying her the best gift I have to "
"offer: my taste and expertise? Frankly, what Daphne really deserves is the gift of Frasier. "
"Roz: Suddenly that crock pot I'm giving them doesn't sound so bad. "
"Frasier: Oh, shut up "
"Frasier: Hello, Niles. You look like a man who's been waiting to be asked why he's grinning. "
"Niles: Oh, I was just thinking about the other day when you said how you thought dating services were all a big con. Well, I just got conned into meeting the most enchanting woman. "
"Frasier: I don't know what to say. "
"Niles: And I owe it all to 'Executive Match.' "
"Frasier: Now I do. The name of this service is 'Executive Match?' "
"Niles: Right, and you thought these women all beneath me. "
"Frasier: Beneath you and countless others. Niles, do you have any idea... "
"Niles: She's always on the phone. Whatever it is she does for a living, she's in great demand. "
"Frasier: So you have no idea what line of work Sabrina's in. "
"Niles: I'm guessing high-priced lawyer. I heard her quote her hourly rate on the phone. Believe me, you don't want to be on the receiving end of that bill. "
"Frasier: Niles, I feel I must warn you... "
"Niles: Oh please, spare me your condescending advice. Why can't you simply say you were wrong? "
"Frasier: You have no idea what you're doing "
"Niles: I know exactly what I'm doing And you could learn a thing or two from me, Mister One-Date-And It's Over. I am taking it slow with Sabrina. "
"Frasier: You mean you haven't? "
"Niles: ...haven't? "
"Frasier: Haven't...? "
"Niles: Oh, please Are you mad, you don't proposition a woman like that on the first date. Last night, I dropped her home after dinner with nothing more than a courtly kiss on the wrist. Tonight may proceed to hand holding. If all goes well, in two weeks I shall storm the citadel of her womanhood. "
"Niles: Sabrina, this is Frasier. "
"Frasier: Hello, lovely to meet you. "
"Sabrina: Nice to meet you. You really have a great brother. He's charming and witty and intelligent and handsome. "
"Niles: I paid her to say that. "
"Frasier: Of course you did "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Finally, the doves have arrived. Come in, come in. Lathbert, thank you so much for coming, lovely flowers, I'll let you know. "
"Daphne: Dr. Crane, was that the florist for my wedding? "
"Frasier: In his dreams God, the man's arrangements are one big cliché. Look at this, his answer to everything is baby's breath, baby's breath, baby's breath. "
"Daphne: Does that woman with the harp have something to do with my wedding too? "
"Frasier: No, Daphne, she's selling them door to door. Of course it's for your wedding. She's auditioning. "
"Daphne: Dr. Crane, I really don't think... "
"Martin: Oh good, Daphne, you're here too. Listen, I want to show you guys a little something I thought up for the wedding. [acting as a minister] It is now the time in the ceremony for the rings. May I have them, please? "
"Martin: Course, it's a lot more effective when he's in his little tux. "
"Frasier: Dad, please, it's all just a bit much, isn't it? We don't want to turn this wedding into a circus. Now, the dove man. "
"Daphne: Dr. Crane, about the doves... "
"Frasier: Just picture it, Daphne. Aren't they something? As you and Donny exit the church one dozen white birds of peace will be released and circle above. Of course, we'll use fourteen in actuality - the power lines always take out a few. "
"Daphne: Dr. Crane, about the doves, well it just seems a little grand. I mean, what's wrong with throwing a bit of rice? "
"Frasier: Well, if you want rice, of course, you'll have rice. Sometimes it seems nothing I do is good enough. "
"Daphne: No, no, no, I suppose doves will be fine. "
"Martin: Frasier, is that Reverend Franklin in the kitchen? "
"Frasier: Yes it is, Dad. "
"Martin: You're auditioning our minister for the wedding? "
"Daphne: Don't you think Donny and I should have a say in who marries us? "
"Frasier: Of course, Daphne, I'm just whittling down the possibilities. The final choice is yours. "
"Marco: Who's tasting the first course? "
"Frasier: Oh, that would me. "
"Daphne: Who's that? "
"Frasier: That's Chef Marco from the Mercer Club, Daphne. Today we'll be sampling each of our four courses. "
"Daphne: No, I was planning on serving a buffet. That way people can mingle, it's more festive. "
"Frasier: We are talking about your wedding, not brunch with all the fixin's at 'Billy Bob's Blackjack Boomtown.' "
"Niles: Hello, Frasier, you remember Sabrina. "
"Frasier: Yes, of course, lovely to see you. Niles, what are you doing here? "
"Niles: Oh, we're out for an afternoon of bird watching. It's the start of mating season, you know. Just wanted to introduce my new girlfriend to Dad. Dad, this is Sabrina. "
"Martin: Hey, nice to meet you. "
"Sabrina: Nice to meet you too. I should really call my office, about how long do you think we'll be gone? "
"Niles: Er, about eight hours. "
"Sabrina: Great "
"Roz: Oh, Daphne, I didn't know you were going to be here. I just want to drop these off for Frasier. "
"Daphne: Roz, I'm glad you dropped by, I need to talk to you about my wedding. Do you mind if we speak in the hallway? "
"Roz: Actually, I don't have much time. "
"Daphne: Well, then I'll get right to it. "
"Deliveryman: Excuse me, do you know where Dr. Crane lives? "
"Daphne: Right here, can I help you? "
"Deliveryman: I'm dropping off this bridesmaid dress. "
"Daphne: Oh, I'll take that. I'm the bride. "
"Daphne: What I need to ask you is, how do you ever get Dr. Crane to listen to you... "
"Roz: Is this the bridesmaid dress? "
"Daphne: He's driving me mad. He doesn't listen to anything I say... "
"Roz: The woman you ask to be bridesmaid gets to wear this? "
"Daphne: And the worst part is... "
"Roz: Is that silk? "
"Daphne: Well, he's just like my mother, controlling and stubborn. I mean, what am I going to do? "
"Roz: Well, Daphne, it's your wedding. Just tell Frasier how you feel. "
"Daphne: Yeah, well that's a bit difficult for me. You see, there was no talking to my mother. Anytime I sort of tried all I hear is 'Just do it my way, you'll thank me later.' Every time she said that I just wanted to explode. "
"Roz: Look, Frasier's a reasonable guy. Just go in there and be direct. "
"Daphne: You're right, I'm going to and... Roz, I was going to ask you if you wanted to be one of my bridesmaids? "
"Roz: Oh my God, are you serious? This is coming out of nowhere. I'd love to. "
"Daphne: Don't worry. Once I'm in charge you won't have to wear this thing Dr. Crane picked out. I mean, he calls this a bridesmaid dress The sleeves aren't even puffy. "
"Martin: So, how long have you guys been seeing each other? "
"Sabrina: Let's see. Since we've met it's been about seventeen, no, eighteen hours. "
"Niles: She actually counts the minutes we've been together. "
"Frasier: Niles, may I see you in the kitchen? "
"Niles: Excuse me. "
"Daphne: Dr. Crane, I need to talk to you. "
"Frasier: Not now, Daphne. "
"Daphne: All right. "
"Niles: All right, what is it? "
"Frasier: Niles, it's about Sabrina. She's a prostitute. "
"Niles: Frasier, I don't like lawyers anymore than you do, but frankly a man whose face is plastered on every bus in town should be careful what terms he bandies about. "
"Frasier: Niles 'Executive Match' is an escort service. One of Donny's clients was caught using them. "
"Niles: I don't believe you. "
"Frasier: Niles, does Sabrina laugh at everything you say, is she fascinated by everything about you, even your collections? "
"Niles: Well, yes. Actually, I even showed her my rarely-seen collection of eighteenth century Portuguese bud vases. "
"Frasier: And how did she react? "
"Niles: Well, if you must know, she was rather aroused. She said she loved a man who collected porcelain and- Oh my God, I'm dating a whore They have my credit card number, I've been running up a tab I've got to get her out of here "
"Niles: Sabrina, we should be going. "
"Martin: What's the hurry? We're having a nice conversation. "
"Sabrina: Yeah, I love your dad. "
"Frasier: Did I mention he used to be a police officer? "
"Sabrina: Maybe we should go. "
"Franklin: Surely you can stay a little while, I haven't seen Niles in ages. You know, I used to teach him in Sunday school. "
"Martin: Oh, you know Reverend, I can still remember dropping him off for his first class. It seems like only yesterday. "
"Frasier: Oh, Daphne, I believe I have chosen your bouquet. [picks one up] It's hand-woven out of pygmy orchids. "
"Daphne: Dr. Crane, I really need to talk to you. "
"Frasier: Well, of course, Daphne. First let's sample the Porcinni mushrooms. They're exquisite. "
"Daphne: But I don't like mushrooms "
"Frasier: You only think you don't, you haven't tried these. "
"Daphne: Dr. Crane, this is really... "
"Frasier: Try this for me, you'll thank me later. "
"Daphne: You'll thank me later? I've heard that my whole life, well, no more I'm doing my wedding my way. And if that means I want rice instead of doves and a DJ instead of a harp, then that's what I'll have. I don't want your advice, I don't want your money and I don't want your mushrooms. I'm in charge of this wedding now. And what kind of a git walks down the aisle carrying something of pygmy orchids "
"TO: "
"Martin: Is she all right? "
"Frasier: She's fine. We had a nice talk. "
"Martin: Well, that's good. Wedding still on track? "
"Frasier: Absolutely. "
"Martin: You just got a little carried away, that's all. "
"Frasier: Oh, I guess so, yeah. You know, it suddenly occurred to me when I was talking to Daphne that I never really got the wedding of my dreams either. Oh sure, you know, my first one was a little clandestine affair we dashed off at the city hall. I could have hardly imagined a wedding more lacking in ceremony. Until my second wedding, which was lacking a bride. Then came Lilith. If I knew then what I know now, I would have walked down the aisle with the ice sculpture and had her stand by the buffet table to keep the shrimp cold. "
"Martin: Oh, so you've had a few bad weddings. "
"Frasier: I guess I was just taking my last best shot at the wedding I shall never have for myself. "
"Martin: Oh, come on. "
"Frasier: Oh, let's face it, "
"Dad: I'm no spring chicken. Do you really see me getting married again? "
"Martin: Well, I guess I've had my doubts, but right here, right now, I "
"think: yeah, you're going to meet someone. "
"Frasier: Do you really think so? "
"Martin: Yes I do and I'll tell you why. If Niles can meet a great gal like Sabrina, then there's hope for all of us. "

"Frasier: Hello? "
"Carlos: Dr. Crane? "
"Frasier: Yes, who's this? "
"Carlos: Dr. Kaufmann. Bob Kaufmann of the National Psychotherapy Institute. Oh my gosh, it's six-fifteen in the morning your time. I hope I didn't wake you. "
"Frasier: No, no, I was up. Er, where did you say you were calling from? "
"Carlos: The National Psychotherapy Institute... "
"TO: KACL "
"Carlos: ...in Saddle River, New Jersey. "
"Frasier: Oh yes, of course. What can I do for you? "
"Carlos: Oh, for Pete's sake. No one called you? You won our Radio Therapist of the Year Award. Congratulations. "
"Frasier: Well, thank you. Of course, the work itself is honor enough. "
"Carlos: Thank you And I'm sorry about the mix-up. The problem is we're going to need some pictures of you so we can get started on the statue. "
"Frasier: Statue? "
"Carlos: For our Hall of Thinkers. Angie, he never got the packet "
"Frasier: Is there anything I can do? "
"Carlos: Well, it's a little late now, but maybe if you describe your body we could get started on the preliminary carving. The sculptor's right here. Fortunately we got Herr Gustav Brumhalt. "
"Frasier: Oh, my. "
"Chicken: Dr. Crane, please, ja? "
"Frasier: Yes, yes, this is Dr. Crane speaking. Herr Brumhalt, may I say, it's quite an honor. "
"Chicken: Ja, Ja, Ja. We have your face, very handsome, but I need you to describe your body. "
"Frasier: Yes, of course. Er, six foot one, medium build, broad shoulders, sublimely proportioned... "
"Chicken: Ja, das ist gut, Ja. But before I order my marble I need to describe your, how do I say this, where you sit? Ja? "
"Frasier: Oh, my posterior, yeah well, that's a little sensitive, isn't it? "
"Chicken: Oh, you don't want to tell me, I understand, it's a big one. Angie, order the big marble, please. "
"Frasier: Please put Dr. Kaufmann back on. "
"Chicken: No, I have a better idea. Why don't you send us a picture of your hindquarters and send it into KACL's new morning team... "
"Carlos: Carlos And The Chicken "
"Frasier: Dr. Kaufmann? Angie? "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Morning "
"Daphne: Good morning, Dr. Crane. "
"Frasier: You won't believe what just happened to me I was the victim of a radio prank. "
"Daphne: Oh, how terrible "
"Frasier: Yes, it's a sad day when getting a man to describe his own behind passes as humor. "
"Frasier: You heard the whole thing, didn't you "
"Daphne: Ja I'm sorry, Dr. Crane, but they can be funny. "
"Frasier: Oh, that's all right, Daphne. 'Carlos and the Chicken' are the sort of performers who keep popping up on the radio these days. So-called humorists who rely on cruel pranks and scatological references. Well, I suppose that's the sort of thing that passes for entertainment these days. You know, perhaps it's just a generational thing. "
"Martin: Man, they got you good The Chicken was on fire What a great bit "
"Daphne: Yeah, I think it will be bit of the day. "
"Martin: Yeah "
"Frasier: I'm going back to bed. "
"Martin: Frasier, wait a minute, can you get me a tape of the show? "
"Frasier: What on earth for? "
"Martin: How often do you get to hear your son on the radio? "
"Frasier: I'm on the radio everyday "
"Frasier: Hello Roz, I suppose you heard about my unscheduled appearance on KACL's new morning show. "
"Roz: No, what happened? "
"Frasier: Well, the less said about it, the better. "
"Roz: Come on Frasier, why don't you pull up a couple of chairs and tell me about it? "
"Frasier: Was everyone in Seattle listening at six in the morning? "
"Roz: Did they do it at six? I heard the replay at eight. "
"Waitress: I heard it at nine-fifteen. "
"Roz: Congratulations, you were bit of the day "
"Frasier: Oh, I thought the entire thing was rude and childish. "
"Roz: Well, you're just mad because you fell for it. Come on, Frasier, 'Hall of Thinkers'? "
"Frasier: Well, it's not such a bad idea. In a society where we glorify our athletes and rock musicians, I thought maybe we should... Well, it was early. "
"Roz: Hey, that's them over there with Kenny. Wow The Chicken's a lot cuter than he is on his billboard. Of course, he's not squatting in a feather suit trying to hatch Carlos's head. "
"Frasier: Do you know, I think I might just go over there and introduce myself. "
"Roz: I don't know what you're thinking, but don't. "
"Frasier: I'm just going to go over there and let them know that what they did today was completely unacceptable. "
"Roz: Frasier, I know guys like this. Once they know they can rattle you, they never stop. Just take your lumps and laugh it off. "
"Frasier: I'm perfectly capable of laughing it off, I just want to let them know that I don't appreciate being made the punch line at my own station. I'm going to go over there and tell them from now on, I don't want any part of their shenanigans. "
"Roz: Oh God, please don't say 'shenanigans' "
"Frasier: Hello, Kenny. I believe introductions are in order. "
"Kenny: Oh, right, Dr. Frasier Crane, this is the Chicken and Carlos. "
"Carlos: Ah, ah... "
"Kenny: What? "
"Carlos: We're actually called 'Carlos and the Chicken.' "
"Frasier: Yes well, nice to meet you boys. About this morning... "
"Kenny: Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, I don't want to see any feathers flying here. Just kidding. "
"Carlos: Dr. Crane, I hope we didn't go too far. We love your show. "
"Frasier: Really, you're listeners? "
"Carlos: Oh yeah, we're big fans. And you know, the last thing we want to do is step on your toes. "
"Frasier: Well you know, you do tread a fine line with your style of comedy, but perhaps you can be excused for stomping on it rather exuberantly on your first day. Just keep in mind in the future that this station does have a certain pecking order. "
"Carlos: We totally get it, Dr. Crane, it felt wrong when we did it. "
"Chicken: Sure did, sure you're not upset or anything? "
"Frasier: Oh no, no harm, no foul. "
"Chicken: It's great meeting you, Dr. Crane. "
"Frasier: Likewise, boys. Hey, call me Frasier, but don't call me at home. "
"Carlos: And Dr. "
"Crane: we're listening "
"Roz: Is it over? I couldn't look. "
"Frasier: For God's sake, Roz, have a little faith in me. After all, I do reason with people for a living. It's all settled. You know, they're good kids, really, quite sensible actually. "
"Roz: Yeah, if you go for beer-belching frat boy types - which I do, was the Chicken wearing a wedding ring? "
"Frasier: You know, I really did overreact this morning. After all, it was kind of cute, I suppose. 'Hall of Thinkers.' Never let it be said that Frasier Crane is the kind of man who is incapable of laughing at himself. "
"Waitress: These are for you. "
"Frasier: Yes, I see, some patron has sent me some sticky buns. Very funny. Very funny, indeed. "
"Waitress: You ordered those, sir. "
"Frasier: Oh, so I did, thank you. "
"TO: "
"Martin: No kidding. He's flying you to Las Vegas for the fight? That's a great son you've got there, Duke. "
"Daphne: Good morning, Dr. Crane. "
"Niles: Hello, Daphne, Dad. Frasier, I thought you might like to join me. I'm going down to Abigail's to have my crepe pans re-seasoned. "
"Frasier: Gosh, I'd love to, Niles, but I've just drawn myself a nice herbal bath. "
"Martin: No, no, it's just Daphne, she's watching PBS. Okay, I'll talk to you later, Duke. Does the whole world have to know what goes on in this house? "
"Frasier: Help yourself to some coffee, Niles. "
"Niles: Thank you. "
"Daphne: Dr. Crane, how do you know it's time to have your crepe pans re-seasoned, anyway? "
"Niles: It can be confusing. But this may "
"help: 'Saucepans in summer, crepe pans in fall, when winter's upon us, there's food for us all.' "
"Martin: Whoever it is, I am not home, I am not here "
"Niles: Hello. "
"Chicken: Is Dr. Crane there? "
"Niles: No, actually he's taking a bath. "
"Chicken: Who's this? "
"Niles: This is his brother, Niles. "
"Chicken: Okay, well this is the building superintendent. "
"TO: KACL. "
"Chicken: I'm in the bathroom just below his and I think the pipes are getting corroded. Is your brother putting anything unusual in his bath? "
"Niles: I'm not exactly sure what he puts in his bath. Better let me ask him. "
"Martin: I smell a bit. "
"Daphne: Put the radio on. "
"TO: Frasier's Bathroom. "
"Frasier: I'm in the mood for love... "
"Niles: Frasier- "
"Frasier: Simply because you're near me... "
"Niles: Frasier, what do you put in your bath water? "
"Frasier: You know very well it's a proprietary blend, Niles. "
"Niles: No, no, no, it's your super. There's something corroding the pipes in the unit below you, he thinks it may be something in your tub. "
"Frasier: Hello, yes, I'm sure it's not my fault but if you insist, I use... ...jasmine, lavender, rose hips and a little Tahitian Vanilla. "
"Chicken: Yeah well, it sounds okay. Boy, with a bath like that I bet the ladies sure go for you though, huh? "
"Frasier: Yes well, love does enter through the nose. "
"Chicken: Hey you know, the neighbors down here have been complaining about a little sound bleed-through. I think we got a bad tile, I sure would like to check it. I heard you sing into the phone earlier. You think you could, I don't know, do it again? "
"Frasier: All right. "
"TO: KACL. "
"Chicken: Yeah, that's great. I definitely heard some bleed-through. You know, I could isolate the tile if you could just walk around a little bit... or maybe you know, if you could stomp around that would be great. "
"Frasier: Stomp around? "
"Chicken: Yeah, well look, if it's too much trouble I could send my assistant, Jimmy, up to stomp around. "
"Frasier: Oh, no, no, please. You just leave Jimmy where he is. I certainly don't need an audience while I'm singing in the bathtub. "
"Chicken: I really appreciate this. We'll get it all cleared up in a jiffy. Thanks a lot, Dr. Crane. "
"bathroom: "
"Frasier: Just wait a second and I'll tell you when I'm ready. "
"Frasier: I'm ready. Here goes. "
"Frasier: I'm in the mood for love, Simply because you're near me, Funny but... "
"TO: we see a shot of Roz listening to this in her car. "
"Frasier: When you're near meeeeee.... "
"TO: the bathroom. "
"Frasier: I'm in the mood for love... "
"Chicken: Oh my God The whole ceiling's falling down. Ow "
"Frasier: Oh, good Lord "
"Frasier: Niles, be careful, the whole ceiling's caving in. "
"Chicken: Hey listen, I think we found out what the problem "
"is: it's that humongous ass of yours "
"Carlos: Listeners, 'Carlos and the Chicken' are offering one thousand dollars for the best picture of Frasier Crane's humongous ass for our website. "
"Frasier: Oh, dear God "
"Niles: Now, now, it won't get you down for long. You've always had a thick skin. Unless that Tahitian Vanilla softened you up a bit... "
"Frasier: GET OUT "
"Frasier: Leave me alone For God's sake, have some respect. "
"Martin: Was that Mrs. Kurdsmen? "
"Frasier: She dropped her medication in the hallway. As I stooped to pick it up, out came her camera like an assassin's blade. Well, if she wants to control those blood clots, she'll cough up that film "
"Martin: You're really getting riled up. "
"Frasier: I certainly am. "
"Martin: Come on, they're just pranks. Back in the force, we used to do stuff like this all the time. We'd fill a guy's hat with shaving cream or nail his shoes to the floor. Sometimes we'd get a guy dead drunk and leave him in a drawer in the morgue "
"Frasier: You know, Dad, I might have been able to laugh it off if all of Seattle hadn't started stalking me with cameras "
"Frasier: Quickly Niles, inside, come on "
"Niles: Why didn't you hold the elevator? Didn't you hear me shouting? "
"Frasier: That was you? I'm sorry, Niles, I was afraid you were trying to get a picture of my butt "
"Niles: How exciting to be present at the birth of a new phobia. "
"Frasier: I'm talking about Carlos and the Chicken. "
"Niles: Oh, yes, their little contest. I can't believe anyone's taking that seriously. "
"Frasier: Oh, well, they won't be for much longer. I've decided it's time to fight back. I was up to all hours last night crafting my response to those two idiots. I believe I have arrived at a masterful rebuttal. "
"Martin: I'm not sure you want to call it your reBUTTal. "
"Niles: I see your 'Bartlett's' is out. You're not pulling any punches "
"Frasier: Hardly. I go in swinging with La Roché"
"foucauld: 'If we had no faults of our own, we would not take so much pleasure in noticing those of others.' "
"Niles: Ouch "
"Frasier: And when I've knocked them reeling, I go in with a jab of Dorothy "
"Parker: 'Wit has truth in it, wise-cracking is merely calisthenics with words.' "
"Niles: Pow "
"Frasier: And when they're bloody and against the ropes, I go in with the kill - Twain, Wilde, Twain, Twain, Mencken "
"Niles: It's not a fight, it's an execution "
"Martin: You know Frasier, if you go and read that on the air you're going to set yourself up for a year of abuse. You know, this kind of thing is probably the reason why these guys started picking on you in the first place. "
"Frasier: All right, Dad, what exactly are you saying? That I somehow managed to bring all this misery on myself? "
"Martin: No, I'm not saying that, just... well, have you ever wondered why these bullies have always kind of zeroed in on you two? "
"Niles: No, we don't wonder why, we know the "
"reason: "
"Niles: Jealousy "
"Martin: Okay, so there's a little bit of that too. But you know, you kinda give people the impression that you're... above them. "
"Frasier: Pish-tosh "
"Niles: Poppycock "
"Niles: Morning, Daphne. "
"Frasier: Oh, Daphne, do you think we're snobby, superior and condescending? "
"Daphne: That's it I'm getting my door sound-proofed. "
"Martin: See what I mean? People think you're stuffy. You know, with your opera parties, and your wine parties, and your seasoned crepe pans. "
"Frasier: In my defense, Niles is the only one who has ever seasoned his crepe pans. "
"Niles: Which is the precisely why I've had the same set since the ninth grade, thank you very much. "
"Martin: My point is, you guys could never resist putting on airs. Even when you were in junior high, you used to love that TV program, 'The Avengers.' You used to run all over the neighborhood pretending you were that guy with the umbrella... Steve. "
"Frasier: Steed "
"Niles: Dad "
"Frasier: There were worse role models. Steed was dapper and witty. When anyone tried to give him grief, he gave them a sound thrashing with the umbrella. "
"Martin: Well, that's great, admire him if you want. But did you have to run through the neighborhood in bowler hats? I mean, you were just begging to get beat up. "
"Frasier: Come to think of it, it was rather a rough summer that year, wasn't it? "
"Niles: I remember getting a chin strap so the bowler wouldn't fall off when I ran. "
"Martin: And all that did was make you look like Elizabeth Taylor in 'National Velvet.' My point is, if you go down to the station and read that over the air, then you might as well go down there in a great big bowler hat. I mean, people are never going to let you forget it. "
"Daphne: You know, it's funny hearing you talk about 'The Avengers.' My first Halloween in America, I went to a party dressed as Mrs. Peel. Head-to-toe in that skintight black leather catsuit. Come to think of it, I still have it somewhere, and Halloween's coming up. "
"Martin: Catsuit, huh? Better not let this guy hear you talking about that, he'll go nuts. "
"Niles: I would not ...be surprised if he did Ho-ho-ho. "
"Frasier: Excuse me. Hello? Why, Roz - yes, just calm down. No, no, I'm not listening. Hang on a second. "
"Frasier: Roz Oh, dear God "
"Carlos: I think we're going to have to throw a bucket of water on those two. "
"Chicken: Roz and Frasier stopped around for a quick hello, next thing you know, they're getting it on in the booth "
"Frasier: Roz "
"Roz: Frasier "
"Frasier: Roz "
"Roz: Frasier "
"Frasier: Do we have time to squeeze in one more? "
"Roz: Plenty of time, Frasier. Two more minutes. "
"Carlos: You know, for a man carrying around a good fifty extra pounds of ass, Frasier Crane has got unbelievable stamina. Frasier, where do you get your energy? "
"Frasier: Lavender, rose hips and a little Tahitian Vanilla. "
"Carlos: Oh my God, they're changing positions. I've never seen that one before. "
"Frasier: Love does enter through the nose. "
"Frasier: Call you back, Roz. I'm going down there. "
"Martin: Frasier... "
"Frasier: Dad, don't try to talk me out of this, I'm going to teach those two a lesson, they'll not soon forget. Where's my umbrella? "
"Martin: Oh no, not that again Not the umbrella, I'm begging you "
"Frasier: It's raining "
"Frasier: No No, stop it "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Roz, what are you doing here? "
"Roz: I am getting revenge, that's what These guys are going down Did you hear the disgusting, vile things they said about me? "
"Frasier: Just the part about us having sex. "
"Roz: Exactly And now they've got a photo contest about me now, too. "
"Frasier: Roz, a thousand dollars for a shot of your behind? Sorry. "
"Roz: No, it's fifty bucks and a six-pack. And there were seven winners before I even left the house. Frasier, what shall we do? Slash their tires, should we crack their windshields? "
"Frasier: No, I was thinking of a more direct approach, Roz. "
"Roz: Oh, I'm down with that too Next commercial, I'll get the Chicken, you take the big guy. "
"Frasier: No, no, that's not it and you know it, Roz. "
"Roz: I knew you'd say that. Fine, I'll take the big guy. "
"Frasier: No, no, Roz. Listen to yourself, you're lusting for blood like a barbarian. I've a more civilized approach in mind. I have composed a speech "
"Roz: A speech? Well, unless you plan to roll it up and cram it down their throats, what good is that gonna do? "
"Frasier: Just watch me. "
"Roz: No, Frasier, they're never going to stop making fun of you. "
"Frasier: Roz, I don't care. I just figured out something, you know, maybe you can't stop bullies from attacking you, but the only way they win is if they change who you are, and I'll tell you something, let them do their worst. They will not knock the bowler off of this head "
"Roz: What does that mean? "
"Carlos: Holy Cow, look who just walked into the "
"booth: Frasier Crane, the automatic sex pilot. "
"Chicken: What's up, love doctor? "
"Frasier: Oh, I think you two know what's up. There's only so much I can take, there's only so much anyone can take from a juvenile comic and his straight man. I believe it was La Rochéfoucauld who first said... "
"Chicken: Listen to me, I'll take my straight man over your sex- starved producer any day, my friend. "
"Roz: Nobody... "
"Carlos: Hey, wait a second, I'm not your straight man. If anything, I'm the funny one. "
"Chicken: Let's not start with this again, okay? "
"Carlos: You're the one who just started it, on the air "
"Frasier: It was La Rochéfoucauld that first said... "
"Carlos: You always do this. "
"Chicken: Hey Carlos, the therapist said not to use the word 'always.' "
"Carlos: I just wish you could say I was as funny as you are. "
"Chicken: Now, I wish I could say that too, but who does all the funny voices? "
"Frasier: La Rochéfoucauld once said- "
"Carlos: If I'm so unfunny, how come I get all the solo gigs? "
"Chicken: Oh, now I'm laughing, ha-ha "
"Carlos: Don't believe me? Ask our agent "
"Chicken: You talked to Zachary behind my back. "
"Frasier: You know, if I could just get a word in... "
"Carlos: I'm going. "
"Chicken: Go ahead, be my guest. "
"Carlos: Great, because I don't need you and I don't need 'Carlos and the Chicken.' "
"Chicken: Oh, really? Well, best of luck, funny boy "
"Carlos: Same to you, Dwayne "
"Chicken: Hey, that's not cool. "
"Frasier: Chicken I believe it was La Rochéfoucauld, the great French thinker... "
"Chicken: Hey, give it a rest, double-wide, I went to grad school too. And P.S."
": It's pronounced 'La Rochéfoucald.' "
"Frasier: That's it Nobody corrects my French pronunciation, you son of a... "
"Kenny: Did you have to be so vicious? "
"Frasier: Me? "
"Kenny: We got dead air, take over "
"Frasier: Yes, right. This is Dr. Frasier Crane, I'll be filling in for the next hour of the morning zoo with my own particular brand of zany antics. Let's see, em, you know there was a fabulous cartoon in the recent 'New Yorker'. Let me see if I can describe it for you... "

"Frasier: Till tomorrow then, this is Dr. Frasier Crane wishing you... "
"Frasier: Oh, yes. Be sure to tune in later for the final broadcast of KACL's loveable curmudgeon, Chester Ludgate. You know, most of us here at the station were surprised to hear that he was retiring. I for one thought he'd never leave. "
"Roz: So, should we order a pizza? "
"Frasier: Sorry? "
"Roz: Those PSA's you promised you'd help me with are due tomorrow. "
"Frasier: Oh gosh, Roz, I really am sorry. You know, it seems Mrs. Delafield's daughter is coming here to join us as an intern. I promised Kenny I'd show her around and take her to dinner. "
"Roz: So, while I'm working late, eating my vending-machine dinner, you'll be out having a gourmet meal with some cute rich girl. "
"Frasier: Oh, you can make anything sound unfair. "
": Long blond "
"Kenny: Hey, Doc. "
"Frasier: Kenny, and who have we here? "
"Kenny: Dr. Frasier Crane, I'd like you to meet Miss Poppy Delafield. Well, gotta run. "
"Frasier: Poppy, what a pleasure to meet the daughter of our beloved station owner. So, what brings you to KACL? "
"Poppy: Well, I was in Paris last month - or was it Madrid? - No, Paris, and I said to myself, 'that's enough gallivanting for you, young lady, it's time to get a job.' So I flew home and asked my mother, Minnie, if I could nose around and see if some job, you know, spoke to me at one of her radio stations, or TV stations or newspapers. But not her brewery, thank you very much So, here I am. Sleeves rolled up, ready to learn. Is this where you do your show? Of course it is, there's your mike right in front of me. Earth to Poppy "
"Poppy: There's Gil, I met him earlier. Hi, Gil "
"Poppy: Nice man. I think it's marvelous what you do. To really help people. Unlike the psychiatrists I've been to, both of whom had some sort of, I don't know, narcolepsy. I sympathize, but if you can't stay awake, don't be a psychiatrist "
"Poppy: To do what you do, to face that microphone day after day and know that for the next three hours you're going to have to talk and talk and talk? I could not do it I would freeze Literally freeze "
"Frasier: Excuse me. Hello? Yes, Dad. All right, calm down, calm down. Was there much blood? "
"Poppy: Oh my gosh "
"Frasier: All right, Dad, I'll be there as soon as I can, hang on a second. I'm terrible sorry, there's been a small emergency at home. I'm gonna have to pass on today, may I take a rain check? "
"Poppy: Oh, and we were having such a nice chat. "
"Frasier: This is Roz, my producer. You know Roz, I'll gladly do those promos if you would be so kind as to take Poppy to dinner and answer her questions. "
"Roz: Sure, if you don't get bored listening to me drone on about radio. "
"Frasier: Oh, I don't think there's much chance of that "
"Frasier: What the hell is happening? "
"Martin: Well, remember last week when Eddie killed his first rat? And how proud I was? I told you that story, right? "
"Frasier: Yes, Dad, you told us. If you had a guitar you would have written a ballad. "
"Martin: Well, we were just down in the basement and I saw another rat. I said, 'go get him, boy' So just as he picked him up, had him in his teeth, shaking the life out of him, and I hear this little bell, ting-a-ling. And I thought, 'that's funny - rats don't wear bells' "
"Daphne: Oh, little Robbie Greenberg's missing hamster "
"Frasier: Yes, I read that flyer. He was offering a ten dollar reward. "
"Martin: Well, the most we can claim at this point is about six-fifty. "
"Frasier: You know Dad, this is actually your fault. You know if you hadn't encouraged him after he killed his first rat he wouldn't have moved on to murdering hamsters "
"Martin: Well, what are you talking about? We don't know it was Eddie who killed him. He might have had a heart attack, or some kind of seizure when he bounced off the boiler "
"Frasier: Niles "
"Niles: Prepare to whoop like a sweepstakes winner. Cancel our dinner I've scored us two seats, front row for the event of the season. "
"Frasier: You mean...? "
"Niles: Yes. "
"Frasier: But...? "
"Niles: I know "
"Frasier: Niles "
"Martin: I love it when they do it this way, I can pretend it's a Seahawks game. "
"Frasier: My God, it's for the Cecilia Bartoli concert My God, they've been sold out for months. How on earth did you score these tickets? "
"Niles: I simply phoned the box office and said this is Niles Crane, the new arts critic for 'The Monocle.' "
"Daphne: 'The Monocle.' Isn't that that magazine they hand out to rich people in all the snootiest apartment buildings? "
"Niles: And the snootiest hotels. "
"Frasier: How could this happen, Niles? "
"Niles: I was at a party thrown by the publisher, Olga Suerbread. The pretentious fop who had the job before me was there too, spouting sheer drivel about Leonard Bernstein. Being polite I kept my tongue sheathed. Until he referred to Bernstein's conducting as 'overrated.' "
"Frasier: I assume you pounced? "
"Niles: Like a ninja By the time I had finished with him, Olga could see I was a far better critic than that arrogant poseur. "
"Daphne: She fired him right there? "
"Niles: Well, he was leaving anyway for his junior year abroad. "
"Frasier: Well, it's a post. Congratulations are in order. You know, who would have thought my little brother a professional music critic? "
"Niles: Oh, oh, and not just music. I can review anything I want. Theater, dance, art exhibits. "
"Frasier: You don't say? "
"Niles: Yes, from now on, wherever we go, I'll be armed with my trusty pad and penlight. "
"Frasier: Wherever we go? What fun. "
"Niles: I'll have to take a damp cloth to these opera glasses, although I don't know what will we use them for, sitting in the front row? Unless it's to scan the faces of the jealous people behind us. "
"Martin: So, are you sure you're okay with Niles getting this critic job? "
"Frasier: Why wouldn't I be, Dad? "
"Martin: Oh, come on, I know what it's like with you two when one of you gets something the other one doesn't have. It's like when you were kids. Niles got a telescope, so you had to have a telescope. You got that funny little guitar, Niles... "
"Frasier: Dad, it was called a lute "
"Martin: Oh yeah, whatever. "
"Frasier: Dad, believe me, I do not envy Niles his critic's job. As kids we would aggravate the situation by flaunting our toys in each other's faces. We're much more mature than that now, all right? "
"Frasier: Niles, you know, it's about time we got going. We don't want to be late for the curtain. "
"Niles: Don't be silly, I'm press now. They'll hold it. "
"TO: "
"Poppy: So, that's how it "
"ends: B minus average, ten extra pounds and still no boyfriend. "
"Roz: I see Poppy's having a little party. "
"Frasier: That's not a party, that's a hostage situation. "
"Roz: Thank God today is her last day. You know, this morning she cornered me by the coffee machine and told me her whole life story. I just wanted to grab her by the throat and say, 'What am I, your biographer? Shut up' "
"Gil: Dear God I thought I'd never break free. I feel like a mongoose at the mercy of a chatty cobra. "
"Niles: Hello, all. I see you all ready have the 'Times.' I'm quoted there today. "
"Frasier: In the 'Times?' "
"Niles: Yes, here, it's in an ad for 'St. Joan'"
": ''Incandescent,' Niles Crane, 'The Monocle.'' "
"Roz: Wow Excuse me while I go and tell all my friends I know you "
"Niles: Forgive me. Olga and I were up till all hours at a party for the 'Royal Shakespeare Company.' I'm rubbing pretty impressive shoulders these days. And to think it's all because I have a small column. "
"Frasier: That would certainly be the Freudian interpretation "
"Niles: If I were to review that attitude I would say it was a chilling portrait of malice and envy. "
"Frasier: Oh Niles, I'm not the least bit envious that you get to spout off in that glorified cat-box liner. "
"Niles: You just can't stand it that my opinion means more than yours. That the arts community looks to me for my insight, my approval, my thumbs-up. "
"Frasier: I think we both know what your thumb's up these days "
"Niles: That's a good one, Frasier. Perhaps you should use it in your column. Oh, that's right - you don't HAVE one "
"Frasier: That smug jackass "
"Roz: Frasier, you have a radio show. If you wanted to say what you thought of a play, what's stopping you? "
"Frasier: It's not the same thing as being a real critic, Roz. You don't get free tickets... you don't get quoted... forget hobnobbing. "
"Roz: My God, this competition between you and your brother is sick. Your obsessive one-upmanship. You're both going to end up bitter old cranks like Chester Ludgate. "
"Frasier: You know, you do raise a good point, Roz. "
"Roz: Thank you. "
"Frasier: Chester's time slot is free, I could do my own arts show. "
"Frasier: Kenny? Listen, Roz just had a wonderful idea. "
"Kenny: Yeah, doc? "
"Frasier: What do you say about yours truly hosting a bouncy little show about the arts in Seattle? "
"Kenny: Culture? Wow That's a great idea, let me chew on that and I'll get back to you. "
"Frasier: Great You see, Roz, he loved your idea "
"Roz: That was not my idea. "
"Frasier: It was too your idea. "
"Roz: It was not... "
"Kenny: Look, Doc, honestly, I feel kinda bad about what I just did. I let you think there was a chance that I might you let you do this culture show and... there's not. "
"Frasier: No chance at all? "
"Kenny: No. I mean, come on Doc. You, culture, opera. Who's listening? Not me "
"Frasier: Damn I think my show's a good idea. "
"Roz: Well, Kenny's the station manager and he doesn't. "
"Frasier: You know what, frankly, I don't like his attitude. He acts as if he owns the station but he doesn't. Someone else does. "
"Roz: Poppy "
"Frasier: The next best thing, her mother "
"Roz: No, Poppy. "
"Poppy: Hi, Frasier. "
"Frasier: Hello, Poppy. Gosh, would you care to join? "
"Poppy: I can't. Mummy's taking me shopping. She spoils me something horrible, I guess it's an 'only child' thing. Anything I want, I just have to ask. "
"Frasier: Anything you want? Well, that's interesting. You know, Poppy, we could join each other for lunch after your shopping spree. "
"Poppy: Oh, I'd love it. "
"Frasier: Would you really? You know, it just seems a shame you leaving the station and us never really getting to know one another. "
"Poppy: Oh, it hasn't been easy. I mean, with you having those dental appointments everyday. "
"Frasier: "
"Poppy: You know, I should get the name of your dentist. I can't find one I like. They're always giving me Novocaine when I don't need it and then it's hours before I can talk again. "
"Frasier: Oh yes, well, I can give you his number, although I'm not sure he'd be any different. "
"Frasier: Divine Beethoven. Extraordinary, isn't it? "
"Poppy: Oh, yeah. And do you know what makes it more amazing? "
"Frasier: What? "
"Poppy: He was deaf "
"Frasier: Daphne, more paté please. "
"Frasier: Poppy, I can't tell you how wonderful it is to meet someone who shares my passion for the arts. It's a rare thing to find in Seattle, believe me. "
"Poppy: Is it? "
"Frasier: Oh yes, sadly. If only more people were better informed about our city's rich cultural treasures. But what can we as mere radio folk do? "
"Poppy: Well... What about a radio show all about the arts in Seattle? "
"Frasier: Oh my God, Poppy, that's a wonderful idea. How do you do it, you just pull these things out of the air Good Heavens, of course we'll have to find ourselves a proper host, but who? "
"Poppy: Well someone very smart. "
"Frasier: Oh, indeed. "
"Poppy: And cultured. "
"Frasier: Bien Sur "
"Poppy: And with a lovely speaking voice. "
"Frasier: Oh, I don't think we need to look too far. "
"Daphne: Here you go. It's very rich, so don't spread it on too thick "
"Poppy: Frasier, I'm so glad you're on board with this. "
"Frasier: You know, my only concern is will Kenny go for it? You see, he's a bit of a Philistine. It might be better if the suggestion came not actually from us but from... [no response] someone else. "
"Poppy: Who? "
"Frasier: Well, someone with more authority, power, influence... [no response] Someone older... A woman perhaps... "
"Daphne: Your mother He means your mother "
"Poppy: Oh, what a great idea. I'll call her. "
"Frasier: Here, use mine. "
"Poppy: Thank you. "
"Poppy: Hello, mummy. I'm with Frasier Crane and we think there should be an arts show on KACL. But I really like this idea So, you'll call Kenny and tell him you want this, okay? Love you too, okay, bye. "
"Poppy: And the first show should be? "
"Frasier: Why don't we start tomorrow? But we'll need something to review. "
"Poppy: That revival of 'A Streetcar Names Desire' opens tonight. "
"Frasier: Brilliant, let's go together. I'll see you at the theater. "
"Martin: Oh, Poppy. "
"Poppy: Hewwo, wittle Eddie, did you have a good walk? "
"Martin: Actually, we've just been to the vets. "
"Poppy: I had the cutest little dog when I was young, named Mr. Poops, every time we took him to the vet’s he... "
"Daphne: You took Eddie to the vet, is he sick? "
"Martin: No, it turns out the building security camera caught Eddie taking out Robbie Greenberg's hamster. So this Greenberg kid's trying to make Eddie out to be some kind of pit bull, he's organizing some petition to get him banned from the building. "
"Frasier: Oh Dad, that's terrible. "
"Martin: Yeah, it is. I don't know, I just wanted everyone to see what a nice, calm, friendly dog Eddie was. "
"Frasier: Why did you take him to the vet? "
"Martin: Tranquilizers. They don't even work anyway. I gave Eddie one of those pills on the ride home, they didn't do a thing to him. I don't know, I think maybe he needs something else. "
"Daphne: Uh, Mr. Crane? "
"Frasier: Looks like all he needs is a lava lamp and some sitar music. "
"Frasier: Niles "
"Niles: Well, I'm glad to see you're in a better mood. I was hoping you'd lend me your Tennessee Williams biography. I have to review that revival of 'Streetcar' tonight and I wanted to throw in some background stuff. "
"Frasier: Well, I'm sorry Niles, you know, normally I would have lent it, but I'll be needing it myself for my own review. "
"Niles: Oh. Well, in that case I'll... What? "
"Frasier: Oh, that's right, you wouldn't have heard. You see, starting tomorrow I'll be doing my own little arts show on KACL, twice weekly. "
"Niles: You envious reptile "
"Frasier: Paté? "
"Niles: I achieve one thing, one tiny distinction you don't have, and what do you do? You run whining to Kenny for extra airtime. "
"Frasier: I did no such thing "
"Daphne: No, he went to that Poppy woman instead. "
"Niles: Poppy? "
"Frasier: Is this a panel discussion? "
"Niles: You loathe Poppy "
"Frasier: I do not, I think she's delightful, isn't she? "
"Daphne: She's an idiot "
"Niles: You conniving copy-cat You have to have whatever I have. "
"Frasier: I don't have what you have. My audience is twice as large as yours is "
"Niles: Well, at least my audience can read "
"Frasier: How dare you review my audience "
"Niles: I'll review anything I want to "
"Daphne: I've never seen him like this. Eyes bulging, tongue lolling out... "
"Martin: Oh, he always gets that way when he fights with Niles "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Good morning, Roz. "
"Roz: Hi. "
"Frasier: Are you ready for our debut? I'm thinking of calling the show, 'Frasier Crane's 'I'll Say'.' But with the 'I'll' spelt like a theatre aisle. "
"Roz: That should work real well on radio You better watch out for Kenny, I heard he's pretty mad at you for going over his head. "
"Frasier: He can't be mad at me, the whole thing was Poppy's idea. Oh, here she is now, come to wish me luck. "
"Poppy: I was afraid I wouldn't get here in time. "
"Frasier: Oh, here, here. We've got a few minutes to go before the show starts. Take a seat, catch your breath. Oh gosh, I'm really glad you made it. You know, it wouldn't be a proper debut without you. "
"Poppy: Wow All these buttons, how do you do it? "
"Frasier: Oh, it's not that complicated, really. You know, I turn on the mike here, these are my call buttons. Oh, and I push this button here if I want to cough. "
"Poppy: How does it make you cough? "
"Frasier: You know, Poppy, I hate to rush you, but we've just a couple of minutes before the show so... "
"Poppy: [screams and stands up, only to sit back down again taking a script out of her handbag] I better get a move on. [reads her script] "
"Frasier: Poppy, what are you doing? "
"Poppy: Getting ready for my show. "
"Roz: One minute "
"Frasier: Your show? "
"Poppy: Well, okay, our show. After all, it was your idea for me to do it. Everybody, everybody come in here, please. "
"Poppy: Before I begin my new show I just want to say a few words. Yesterday, I was ready to leave KACL. To run away like I have from so many other challenges. It was the support of one man, Frasier Crane, that helped me overcome this shyness many people may have observed in me, and to follow my dreams. Oh my God, I want to cry. "
"Gil: We all do. "
"Roz: Ten seconds "
"Gil: How could you do this to us? "
"Frasier: I had no idea she intended to stay. "
"Kenny: That's not what her mother told me "
"Gil: And I thought I'd seen some cruel pranks in the army. "
"Frasier: I assure you, she is way out of her depth here. Any moment she'll realize she's in over her head, she'll be begging me to go in there and take over for her. "
"Poppy: 'A Streetcar Named Desire' is a very powerful Broadway play. It was made into a movie starring Marlon Brando. This gave the play a very personal relevance to me, as I once sat next to Mr. Brando on the Concord and we had a very lovely chat until a sudden cramp forced him to change seats.' "
"Poppy: 'Streetcar' tells the tragic tale of Blanche DuBois, who's a very gentile, very proper Southern lady. Or is she? "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Go ahead, Niles, I know you were listening. "
"Niles: Well, I wish you'd lent her your Tennessee Williams's biography. She wouldn't have kept forgetting his name and calling him 'Indiana Jones.' "
"Niles: If it's any consolation, I got fired from 'The Monocle.' "
"Frasier: Niles, I'm sorry. "
"Niles: I panned a wretched musical, not realizing the lead was the person who does Olga's hair. "
"Frasier: She fired you just to placate her hairdresser? "
"Niles: Electrolysist. And if you'd ever seen her in a sundress, you'd forgive her as I have. "
"Frasier: Oh, I am sorry, Niles. Gosh, it's a shame, really. You know, I know how much you loved that job, and to lose it in such an unceremonious fashion. "
"Niles: Well, you know... I was thinking of quitting that job anyway. "
"Frasier: Oh? "
"Niles: I thought I was spreading myself too thin. Getting distracted from my real work. "
"Frasier: I had the exact same thought. Even as I was preparing my show, I thought, 'Am I being fair to my regular listeners?' "
"Niles: They do depend on you. "
"Frasier: As do your patients. "
"Niles: Thank you. "
"Frasier: God, is it any wonder we find ourselves ex-critics? "
"Niles: We were meant to lose those jobs. "
"Frasier: It's as if the Gods of psychiatry, jealous of our dallyings, have quietly stepped in and put things right. "
"Niles: Well put "
"Frasier: Thank you. You know, Niles, if you're feeling a bit hungry, we could catch an early dinner and then... "
"Niles: Oh, oh, and then catch the new Stoppard play. "
"Frasier: You know, it's just a shame my listeners never got to hear my review of 'Streetcar.' "
"Niles: Insightful? "
"Frasier: Groundbreaking "
"Niles: As was mine. "
"Frasier: Yes well, it takes a psychiatrist to interpret that play. "
"Niles: Indeed. "
"Frasier: All right, you go first. "
"Niles: All right. "
"Frasier: Go. "
"Niles: 'A descent into madness, and it was well worth the trip in this incandescent revival of 'A Streetcar Named Desire'....' "
"Frasier: Just a moment Niles, 'incandescent,' isn't that the word they quoted you on in 'The Times?' "
"Niles: Well, yes. "
"Frasier: You use that all the time. "

"Roz: I'm sorry I brought Alice today when we have so much work to do. "
"Frasier: Oh, that's all right, Roz. You know what, you'll find another nanny soon. "
"Roz: I better. I have a date tomorrow. It's my first one in a month. A month Between spending my days with you and my nights with Alice, I've forgot what a real conversation is like. "
"Frasier: Well, don't tell Alice that, it might hurt her feelings. "
"Roz: There we go again "
"Niles: Just look at the dapper gent I ran into on the elevator. "
"Martin: All right, Niles, that's enough. Yes, I like the suit you got me. "
"Niles: All right. Well, tell me about the comments. Did everybody there ooh and aah? "
"Martin: Nope, people were pretty much looking at the guy in the casket. "
"Frasier: So, Dad, how was the funeral? "
"Martin: Oh, it was terrible. It's not at all the way Stan would have wanted it. They did everything on the cheap and that daughter of his, she didn't even get the good priest. She got some rookie from the seminary who stumbled all through the eulogy and couldn't even pronounce 'Wojadubakowski' "
"Niles: Well, I can commiserate with you, Dad. I had a rather bad day on the death front myself. Sherry? "
"Frasier: Yes please, Niles. "
"Niles: I received a letter today saying, thanks to my divorce, I've lost my plot at Seattle's toniest cemetery. "
"Frasier: You mean, you're out of 'Verdant Hills?' Oh, I am sorry, I know how much you were looking forward to being dead there. "
"Niles: They've wait-listed me, but I don't like my odds. "
"Frasier: I don't blame you. One country club fire, you can kiss your chances goodbye. "
"Daphne: I went to all sorts of funerals as a child. My uncle's a mortician. Lovely man. He's offered to do my make-up for the wedding. "
"Frasier: I can just hear the whispers now. 'Did you see the bride? Very life-like.' Dad, you know, I'm sorry about your friend's funeral not going so well. Rest assured, when the time comes - years from now - Niles and I will follow your wishes to the letter. "
"Martin: Thank you. "
"Niles: Wait, Dad, what are your wishes? "
"Martin: Never mind, I'm not going to go planning my own funeral, it's bad luck. "
"Frasier: But, Dad... "
"Martin: Ah, ah, ah, you don't pull the cord on the bus until you're ready to get off. "
"Niles: Pull the what on the what? "
"Frasier: I don't know. "
"Niles: I'm surprised. I didn't know Dad had such a bugaboo about his funeral arrangements. "
"Frasier: Yeah, I know, it's a painful subject, but we've got to plan for it. We all must be prepared when the cold hand of death comes knocking on our door. "
"Frasier: Would you get that? "
"Niles: I most certainly will not. "
"Bulldog: Pizza. "
"Frasier: Bulldog? Good Lord, come in. Oh heavens, you remember my brother Niles. Niles, you remember Bulldog. "
"Niles: Yes, of course. Hello, Bulldog. So, are you delivering pizzas for a living? "
"Bulldog: No, I'm an eccentric millionaire, this has always been my dream. "
"Frasier: Bulldog, I can't tell you... "
"Bulldog: No, no, no. Can the sad face, okay? Just making some extra cash between radio gigs. "
"Frasier: All right. "
"Bulldog: Oh, it's eighteen bucks, by the way. "
"Niles: Well, I just stopped by to leave off these opera tickets. So, I'll be on my way. "
"Frasier: Thank you, Niles. By the way, I'm a little short of cash. Do you mind, er-? "
"Niles: Oh yes, thank you. There you are, and something extra for you. [hands Bulldog a twenty dollar bill] "
"Bulldog: Whoa, that's a pretty generous tip "
"Niles: I'll say, wrong bill "
"Bulldog: Hey, good luck, Doc, I'll see you. "
"Frasier: Thanks Bulldog, take care. "
"Bulldog: All right. "
"Roz: Bulldog? "
"Bulldog: Hello, Roz. "
"Roz: Are you delivering pizzas? "
"Bulldog: Yeah, yeah, this is kinda awkward, huh? "
"Roz: Oh, no, don't be embarrassed. A job's a job. "
"Bulldog: No, I mean awkward for you. This is the first time you've seen me since we had that fling and I dumped ya. "
"Roz: I dumped you, pizza boy "
"Bulldog: Hey, look who's here Hey, sweet pea, you are getting so big. Hey, look at that smile, she likes me. "
"Roz: She's relieved not to be the least mature person in the room anymore. "
"Bulldog: Who's got a mean old mommy? "
"Frasier: Roz. Listen, I think you may have solved your babysitting problem. "
"Roz: Bulldog? Are you nuts? "
"Frasier: Well, "
"look: Alice is obviously crazy about him, and he could use the money. "
"Roz: I don't know. "
"Frasier: Okay, fine, fine, Roz. You just cancel your date. I mean, you've been this long without a man, what's a few days more? "
"Roz: Bulldog, do you want a job? "
"Bulldog: Okay, one more bite, then we can watch 'Sports Center.' "
"Roz: Have you seen my purse? "
"Bulldog: Yeah, it's on the chair. "
"Roz: Steve's going to be here any minute. "
"Bulldog: So, you've been dating for a while? "
"Roz: Actually, no. Tonight's our first date. In fact, it's my first date in a month. "
"Bulldog: Whoa You injured? You pull something? "
"Roz: No. "
"Bulldog: I guess no one quite measured up to that week you spent in the doghouse, huh? "
"Roz: Let's get one thing straight. That little fling we had... "
"Bulldog: I know, I know, I was just joking. "
"Bulldog: Okay. If you're not going to have some peaches, we've got some jello in the fridge. You know, some naughty ladies like to wrestle in that stuff. "
"Bulldog: Who's that? Who's that? He-ho. "
"Steve: Excuse me, is this Roz Doyle's apartment? "
"Bulldog: Yeah, yeah, are you her date? "
"Steve: Yeah. "
"Bulldog: Listen "
"up: if you go out with Roz tonight, I will rip off your arm, ram it down your throat and use it to squeeze your heart until it stops beating. Who's my pretty girl? Okay, dirtball. Listen, when you get out of here, you call Roz and you cancel like a gentleman. As far as she's concerned, this conversation never took place. Got it? "
"Steve: Who are you? "
"Bulldog: I'm your worse "
"nightmare: the babysitter "
"Bulldog: Whoa "
"Roz: Do I look slutty? "
"Bulldog: All right, if you're fishing for "
"compliments: yeah, you look slutty. "
"Roz: Hello? Hey, Steven. Oh, really? Well, tomorrow's Saturday, I mean you won't have to... No, it's okay. Yeah, bye. [hangs up] I don't believe it My first date in a month and he blows me off. "
"Bulldog: What, at the last minute? What a jerk He does not deserve you. "
"Roz: Thanks, Bulldog. "
"Bulldog: Well, I guess I can go. "
"Roz: Mmm. "
"Bulldog: Oh, I ordered a pizza. Just have him drop it by my place. I'm at the YMCA. Have him knock hard, I turn up the radio to drown out the sirens. "
"Roz: Why don't you just stay and have your pizza? "
"Bulldog: Are you sure? "
"Roz: Yeah, it's not like I'm doing anything tonight. Come and tell us what you guys did at the park today. "
"Bulldog: We fed the ducks We went on a pony ride and then came back for a whole jar of peas. "
"Roz: Peas? How did you get her to eat those? "
"Bulldog: There's a trick to it. You've got to pretend to sneeze them out of your nose. "
"Roz: How did you come up with that? "
"Bulldog: It's an interesting story... "
"Roz: Actually, don't tell me. "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Oh, good afternoon, Niles. "
"Niles: Coffee's on me, I'm back at 'Verdant Hills' cemetery. "
"Frasier: Oh, well congratulations, nothing left now but all that pesky waiting. "
"Niles: I haven't got the official word yet but I've called in a "
"favor: Bruce McGurk, he's on the board of directors. I gave him grief counseling when his uncle was lost at sea and it occurred to me, there's a plot gone begging "
"Roz: Tell me something, do I have the word 'loser' tattooed across my forehead? "
"Frasier: No, Roz, but there is a rumor about a 'Tweety Bird' on your upper thigh. "
"Roz: I've had two dates this week and both of them have bailed out on me at the last second. What's wrong with me? "
"Frasier: Oh, don't count yourself out just yet, Roz. "
"Roz: Yeah, right. "
"Frasier: No, no, there's a young man over there, can't take his eyes off you. He's been staring at you ever since you came in. "
"Roz: That's Ted from the ad department We've been making eye contact for months. "
"Frasier: Oh, yes, Ted. Well, his gaze is so steamy it's re-foaming my latte. Why don't you go other there and talk with him? "
"Roz: I can't. I won't know what to say. "
"Frasier: I tell you what, ask him to dinner. I'm going to 'Chez Henri' myself this evening, I'll call and get you a table. "
"Roz: I don't know, I'm feeling a little gun shy. "
"Frasier: Roz, you better hurry. If you talk to me another minute longer, he'll think he's got some serious competition. "
"Roz: Thanks, Frasier, I needed a good laugh to loosen me up. "
"Frasier: Hello, it's Frasier Crane. "
"Frasier: I was just wondering, I'd like to get a table for a dear friend of mine tonight as well. "
"Niles: Niles Crane here. Hello, Bruce. I'm hoping you're calling with good news about 'Verdant Hills?' "
"Frasier: Table for two. "
"Niles: Yes, a plot for one. "
"Frasier: By the kitchen? Oh Lord, I was hoping for something near the fireplace. "
"Niles: Near the parking lot? I prefer the serenity garden. "
"Frasier: Oh, the back row would be fine, who's at the next table? "
"Niles: The hilltops? Divine Who's in the adjacent plot? "
"Frasier: The Ashbys, wonderful "
"Niles: The Ashbys, delightful "
"Frasier: Thank you very much. "
"Niles: I'm very grateful. "
"Niles: McGurk got me a shady spot on the high hill. "
"Frasier: You mean...? "
"Niles: Yes, I'll spend eternity looking down on Maris. "
"Frasier: Oh, Niles. "
"Niles: Checkmate "
"Roz: He said yes. "
"Frasier: Well, of course he did Roz, congratulations. And you're all set at 'Chez Henri.' "
"Roz: Great. "
"Bulldog: Okay, what sorry bastard would steal a pacifier from a kid? Oh, found it, found it. "
"Bulldog: Hi. "
"Roz: You know, Bulldog, I hate to do this to you. Could you babysit tonight? I just get a date with Ted over there. "
"Bulldog: Really? Sure, just say. Way to go, slugger "
"Roz: I better go home and get ready. "
"Bulldog: You go ahead, I'll catch up with you after I go to the can. "
"Roz: Lovely "
"Bulldog: Hey, Ted, right? "
"Ted: Bulldog, long time, no see. "
"Bulldog: I heard you're going out with Roz tonight. "
"Ted: Yeah. "
"Bulldog: Listen up You have her home forty-five minutes after you pick her up or you'll be sorry. "
"Ted: Yeah? What are you going to do about it? "
"Ted: Oh my God "
"Bulldog: If I'm willing to do that to me, just think what I'll do to you. "
"Ted: All right, forty-five minutes. "
"Bulldog: Or else "
"Martin: Hey boys, feel like taking a ride? "
"Frasier: Sure, Dad. Where to? "
"Martin: Well, I got thinking about what we were talking about the other night, you know, about me not having made any arrangements for myself. So, just went out and bought myself a burial plot. "
"Frasier: Okay, all right, let's go have a look, Dad. I'm glad to see you've finally realized there's no point in being superstitious about the whole thing. "
"Martin: Yeah, well, I realized that if I let you plan my funeral there'd be all harps, white wine, and frankly a lot of very pissed-off cops "
"TO: "
"Martin: Right up here on the left. I've got the whole service mapped out. It'll start with a bagpiper marching down the aisle... "
"Daphne: Bagpipes? I'm having bagpipes at my wedding, you knew that "
"Martin: And none of that dainty finger food, either. Big slabs of beef Prime rib. "
"Daphne: You can't have prime rib, I'm having prime rib. "
"Martin: Oh, for Pete's sake. "
"Daphne: No, no, this is lovely If you kick off before I get married, you'll ruin everything. "
"Martin: All right, all right, I'll drop the bagpipes. "
"Daphne: No, no, have the bagpipes And what else are you going to have? A big cake with a little white coffin on the top. "
"Martin: Oh, put a sock in it, will ya? "
"Daphne: It wouldn't surprise me if you had a hearst with 'Just Buried' on the side of it. "
"Martin: Oh, stop it I'm warning you. "
"Martin: Pretty great, huh? Niles and Frasier fake enthusiasm. "
"Martin: I'll put your mom's ashes over there on the left. Because that was her side of the bed and, er, oh, see how close we are to the maintenance shed. "
"Niles: And that's good because? "
"Martin: You're the first one to get mowed Yeah, so do you really like this place? "
"Frasier: Yes, Dad. "
"Martin: Good. Fras', take about three steps over to your left, will ya? "
"Martin: There you are. Niles, stand right next to him. Congratulations, you are standing on your very own graves. "
"Niles: What? "
"Martin: Yes, they were for sale so I went ahead and bought them. And seeing how much you like it out here, I'm glad I did. "
"Niles: But, Dad... "
"Martin: I know what you're gonna say, the expense But don't worry about it. Merry Christmas "
"Ted: Sorry we had to rush out like that. "
"Roz: Me too, is your stomach feeling any better? "
"Ted: Not really. "
"Roz: Fancy some ginger ale or... "
"Ted: I think I really better go now. "
"Bulldog: She's asleep Roz, don't worry I won't disturb you a... Where's Ted? "
"Roz: He ditched me. "
"Bulldog: What? "
"Roz: He kept saying his stomach was bothering him, he was looking at his watch the whole time. "
"Bulldog: What is wrong with men? "
"Roz: It's not them, it's me. It's been happening all week. "
"Bulldog: No, no, no, trust me. It is not you. They're just jerks. "
"Roz: Thanks, Bulldog. "
"Bulldog: Hey, look, if you're hungry, I just whipped up a little something. There's probably enough for two. "
"Roz: Great. I'm just gonna go change, okay? "
"Bulldog: Okay. "
"Bulldog: What the hell are you doing here? "
"Ted: I know, I'm sorry. "
"Bulldog: You are supposed to be gone. How many of my own fingers do I have to dislocate before you take me seriously? "
"Ted: I got her home in forty-five minutes, okay? She left this in the car. "
"Roz: Oh, this smells delicious. Thank you. Ow, I guess I'm a little tense from that date. "
"Bulldog: Allow me. "
"Roz: I forgot how good you were at this Come to think of it, you were good at a lot of things. "
"Bulldog: Wow 'Victoria's Secrets,' page 39. "
"Roz: Why don't we just skip dinner and go straight to dessert? "
"Bulldog: Uh-ho 'Penthouse Forum,' page 23. "
"Roz: Are you the new pizza man? I hope you're not double parked. "
"Bulldog: I promise you, ma'am. I will deliver in thirty minutes or more. "
"Roz: There's a scented candle out on the balcony, would you get that for me? "
"Bulldog: I'm kinda naked here. "
"Roz: Cedar wood, it promotes stamina and sexual creativity. "
"Bulldog: I'll be right back. "
"Bulldog: Roz, open the door. Oh, I get it. Pizza man "
"Roz: You slime bag You've been scaring off my dates all week. "
"Bulldog: I don't know what you're talking about. "
"Roz: Cut the crap. I just saw you talking to Ted. This is the lowest thing you've ever done After the way I've trusted you, this is the way I treat you. "
"Bulldog: Would you let me in, please? "
"Roz: No. "
"Bulldog: It's freezing out here, as you can plainly see "
"Roz: Good, I want you to suffer. "
"Roz: Don't sit there, I eat off that table, for God's sake "
"Roz: Get dressed. "
"Bulldog: Come on, wait. "
"Bulldog: Wait, would you let me explain? "
"Roz: I don't want to hear it, you make me sick Just get it out. "
"Bulldog: I wasn't just trying to get you in bed. Just give me a second, please. Last spring, when we were together, it was great and I didn't know how to handle it, so I ran away. But when I saw you again, it was... I figured if I could keep the competition out of the way, then maybe you and I... I don't know... we could be a couple. "
"Roz: Us? "
"Bulldog: I think I'm in love with you. "
"Bulldog: You're not saying anything, are you? "
"Roz: Wait a minute I know what you're doing "
"Bulldog: What? "
"Roz: All this love stuff, it's just another way of getting me into bed. "
"Bulldog: No, Roz, no. "
"Roz: God, the oldest trick in the book "
"Bulldog: Wait a minute, Roz. "
"Roz: And you're still at it You're still at it You're not Bulldog "
"Bulldog: No, listen. "
"Roz: Give up, Bulldog. "
"Bulldog: You can't blame a guy for trying I had you going, huh? All the dishes and the watering. "
"Roz: You're the master. "
"Bulldog: Yeah, I even put childproof latches on the cabinet. Part of my plan to get you in the sack. "
"Roz: You are such a pig "
"Bulldog: Well, I better be going. "
"Roz: Okay. Thank you for all of your help with Alice. [opens door] I'll see you, Bob. "
"Bulldog: I'll see you, Roz. "
"Roz: I'm sorry, Mrs. Wasnick, I know the balcony is not for sex play "
"Frasier: It's Frasier. And by the way, charming "
"Roz: It's open "
"Frasier: I just saw you dash out of the restaurant with Ted, I thought, 'God, what's wrong?' "
"Roz: You are not gonna believe what just happened. Bulldog just told me he loved me. "
"Frasier: What? "
"Roz: Yeah, he made Ted bring me home early, turns out he's been scaring my dates off all week. "
"Frasier: Well, what did you say to him? "
"Roz: I tried to let him down easy, I felt sorry for the guy. "
"Frasier: Bulldog, wow, he's full of surprises, isn't he? "
"Roz: Who'd have thought? You know what's really weird? I'm gonna miss him. Look at this. I never had to worry about Alice, he kept this place so neat and it was really nice to have someone to... someone to come home to. "
"Frasier: Well, maybe Bulldog, in his own clumsy way, gave you a taste of a more traditional lifestyle. "
"Roz: Yes, I suppose so. "
"Frasier: Who knows, Roz? Maybe the time has come. You might be willing to start looking for a... "
"Roz: What? A husband? "
"Frasier: No, I wasn't going to say that. "
"Roz: Just because I'm gonna miss certain things about Bulldog doesn't mean I need to rush out and get married. Look at this week I've had. Three guys interested in me and not to mention Bulldog. I'm liking this [reassuring herself, arguably in denial] Single life is pretty good. "
"Frasier: All right, Roz, as long as you're okay. "
"Roz: I really appreciate you coming by. "
"Frasier: It's okay. "
"Roz: I'll see you tomorrow. "
"Frasier: Of course. Good night. "
"Roz: Good night. "

"Poppy: Hey, Frasier "
"Frasier: Hello, Poppy. "
"Poppy: You should have your hearing checked. I've been yelling 'wait up' for the last four blocks. "
"Frasier: Well, I must be getting old. "
"Poppy: Like an old man can walk that fast You were practically running the last block. Did I ever tell you about my uncle who ran everywhere? He ran to the store... "
"Frasier: That's a very interesting story. Yes, I'll see you at the station, okay? [notices Roz at a front table] Roz "
"Frasier: Thank God you were here. "
"Roz: I know exactly how you feel. Last week I ducked into a bathroom stall to get away from her and there were three other women already in there. Listen, I have a favor to ask. This friend of mine is running this charity dinner dance Friday night... "
"Frasier: Oh, Roz, say no more. What do they need? An autographed picture for their silent auction? "
"Roz: That would be a silent auction "
"Frasier: Very funny. "
"Roz: No, what I was hoping you'd do is buy a couple of tickets. They're only a hundred bucks each. "
"Frasier: I don't know Roz, I'd have to take a date. Seattle does have certain expectations about the sort of person I'm to be seen with. "
"Roz: Oh, that's easy [points out Niles who has just entered the café] Here he is Let's see if he's free. "
"Frasier: I'll let you know "
"Niles: Mind if I join you? "
"Frasier: Well, actually I'm not staying, I'm avoiding someone. "
"Niles: Oh, who? "
"Frasier: The new so-called arts critic at the station, Poppy "
"Niles: A-ha. "
"Frasier: The woman drives me mad, she gasses on endlessly about the most mundane matters. Absolutely infuriating - [noticing Niles's grin] - as is that smirk of yours. "
"Niles: Well, I'm sorry if I've noticed that not a day goes by that you don't badmouth this woman. "
"Frasier: Well, with good reason. The woman is a windsock. "
"Niles: I'm wondering if someone isn't protesting a bit too much. She's very attractive, obviously well-bred. Perhaps all this 'Pigtails and Inkwells' hostility is actually a veiled attraction. "
"Frasier: Oh, bravo Dr. Crane Yes, I think you're really on to something there. "
"Poppy: Oh, where's Roz gone? "
"Frasier: Oh, she dashed off to the office. We're going to continue our meeting there. You know, Poppy, I was just telling my brother what an enchanting storyteller you are. Why don't you take my seat, and he can find out for himself? Ta-ta. "
"Niles: Well, nice to finally meet you, Poppy. There must be quite a story behind that name. "
"Poppy: Yes. "
"Niles: So... You're the new arts critic at the station, that must be interesting. "
"Poppy: Oh, yes. "
"Niles: Okay, well if you don't feel like talking, I should be really running along anyway. "
"Poppy: No, don't go. I am just amazed at how different you are from your brother. He's sort of intimidating, I get so flustered around him, I just start babbling. But you, you're different. You're very warm. "
"Niles: Thank you. So are you. "
"Poppy: Polite, not to mention stylish and charming, [getting carried away] and incredibly handsome. Oh my God Am I babbling again? "
"Niles: If you were, I'd be too polite and charming to tell you. "
"Regan: Well, what the hell are you doing? "
"Regan: I've been waiting for twenty minutes. [hangs up and then to Frasier] I am so sorry. You're probably wondering who I am. "
"Frasier: I'm mildly curious. "
"Regan: I got into the shower - my shower. I just moved in next door. I probably should have started with that, huh? [shakes his hand] I'm Regan Shaw, by the way. Anyway, the doorbell rang, and I figured it was the phone guy because I've been waiting all day long. I ran to catch him, and stepped out into the hallway and locked myself out. Luckily your father came along. "
"Martin: Hey, Fras. "
"Frasier: Yes, that was lucky. "
"Martin: All right, well this should keep you nice and warm and I'll just run in the kitchen and get you your herbal tea. "
"Frasier: If you'll excuse me, I'll just show my father where it's kept. "
"Martin: Pretty sweet, eh? I found her right out in the hall. "
"Frasier: Yes, well, I'm sorry Dad, but you can't keep her. "
"Martin: No, I've brought her here for you. I've been talking you up the whole time. "
"Frasier: Really? "
"Martin: Yeah. Listen, I've served this one to you on a platter. In fact, if it wasn't for the jasmine on your robe, I'd say this one was a slam-dunk. "
"Frasier: I'm just... "
"Martin: It's a basketball phrase. "
"Frasier: Yes, I know that, Dad. I want to chat up a half naked woman without looking uncouth. "
"Martin: Well, just be friendly, you know. She's a veterinarian, she's single, she's very athletic, as you can tell from that body. And Lord... "
"Frasier: Dad "
"Martin: Just because you're serving the cake doesn't mean you can't have a few crumbs that drop off. "
"Martin: Hi. Well, here we go. There you are. Now, I've got a call to make so Frasier'll keep you entertained. "
"Regan: Thanks for the tea. "
"Martin: Don't mention it. "
"Frasier: So, you're next door? Oh, that's right. Judge Gilroy moved in with his daughter. "
"Regan: I bet he never wandered into your apartment wearing a towel. "
"Frasier: No, but I did hear he wandered into work one day wearing a towel, though. I guess that's why he had to move in with his daughter. "
"Martin: Looks like I walked off with your car keys. I should have known from the big BMW on it "
"Frasier: Thank you, Dad. "
"Frasier: So, Regan, that's an unusual name. Is it by any chance from... "
"Regan: From 'King Lear,' yeah. One of the ungrateful daughters. I don't know what my dad was thinking. Never do. I'm sorry, I have some issues with my father. "
"Martin: Excuse me again. "
"Frasier: I have no idea what that would be like What? "
"Martin: Well, I better be on my way, huh? Just let you two talk. He's a wonderful listener. In fact, that's his motto on his very popular radio show, 'I Listen.' "
"Frasier: Yes, Dad, don't forget my sign "
"off: 'Goodbye' "
"Regan: I actually listen to your show. "
"Frasier: Really? Well, I'm flattered, thank you. "
"Regan: I think if I hadn't gone into veterinary medicine it would have been psychology. Think I was just always drawn to animals. "
"Frasier: Yes, it is hard not to love them. "
"TO: "
"Martin: I just feel so responsible. Maybe there was something more I could have said, something more I could have done. I keep playing it over and over in my head. "
"Frasier: I'll ask her out today, Dad. "
"Daphne: Dr. Crane, do you believe women have an intuition about men? "
"Niles: Intuition? "
"Daphne: Like they might know when a man has a little crush. "
"Daphne: You know, by the way he fidgets or gets a look in his eye or... "
"Daphne: I only ask because I'm getting that feeling from your brother. "
"Niles: Really, huh? "
"Daphne: He's all moony-eyed today, someone he's quite keen on. "
"Niles: Actually I know who it is. I called him on it yesterday in the coffee shop, he won't admit to it. The problem is... "
"Daphne: Yeah? "
"Niles: I've developed a crush myself and it happens to be... "
"Niles: Frasier? Whatcha doing? "
"Frasier: Come in. "
"Frasier: So, Niles. How are you? "
"Niles: Well. The question is, how are you? I hear you're been running around like a love sick schoolboy. "
"Frasier: Who told you that? "
"Niles: Well, let's just say that the birds around here are chirping. Anyway... are you prepared to admit that my little theory yesterday was correct? "
"Frasier: Are you talking about Poppy? "
"Niles: Yes, the woman you so adamantly denied having any attraction to. "
"Frasier: I still do, she's loathsome. "
"Niles: Does it gall you so much to admit I'm right? "
"Frasier: But you're not right. "
"Niles: So, well then, who is this person you're so interested in? "
"Frasier: You don't know her. "
"Niles: Tell me about her. "
"Frasier: It's premature. "
"Niles: Oh, brother "
"Frasier: All right, fine, if you must know. The woman happens to be... "
"Regan: Hello. "
"Frasier: Her, my next door neighbor. "
"Niles: Oh, what good timing she has "
"Frasier: Hi, come in. "
"Regan: I just wanted to return this tea cup. "
"Frasier: Oh, well, you're welcome any time. Er, Regan Shaw, this is my brother, Dr. Niles Crane. "
"Frasier: Do you two know each other? "
"Niles: Yes./No. "
"Frasier: Well, I'll just get us all some coffee and you two can decide if you know each other or not. "
"Regan: I'm so sorry, Dr. Crane. I just was a little startled seeing you outside your office. "
"Niles: Please, don't even think about it, have a seat. Well, so I gather this is your new building. "
"Regan: Yes. Right next door to your brother who I just met. Is that so strange? "
"Niles: Yes, well, remember, I have a policy of total confidentiality. He never needs to know that you've started seeing me. "
"Daphne: Oh, here it is. "
"Frasier: What did you find out? "
"Daphne: It sounded like they've had a date or two. He mentioned having seen her. "
"Frasier: Damn him "
"Daphne: Come to think of it, he said something in the elevator about having a crush on someone. "
"Frasier: Well, I just have to confront him and see if he's man enough to admit he's horned in on my territory. "
"Daphne: Well, excuse me, Dr. Crane, but didn't your brother meet her first? "
"Frasier: Oh, honestly, Daphne, just try to keep up. It's not that complicated "
"Frasier: Well, here we are. "
"Regan: Actually, I can't stay. I've got the heating man coming. "
"Frasier: Oh "
"Regan: Can I take a rain check? "
"Frasier: Well, certainly. Would you like to go out for coffee some time? "
"Regan: Yeah, I'd like that. Bye. "
"Frasier: Great. Bye. "
"Niles: Bye. "
"Frasier: So, I do take it you two know each other. "
"Niles: Well, we met briefly at some event. "
"Frasier: I see. Changing the subject completely, Daphne just mentioned that you happen to have a little crush on someone yourself. "
"Niles: Yes, I have. "
"Frasier: Care to elaborate? "
"Niles: Yes, I will. Unlike you, I don't mind being candid. The woman is Poppy. "
"Frasier: Poppy? "
"Niles: We had coffee yesterday after you left. You're not upset? "
"Frasier: No, not at all. Thank you for your candor, Niles. I'm sure you and Poppy will be very happy together. "
"Niles: Are you laughing at me? You think so little of my chances? "
"Frasier: No, no, Niles. I wish you and Poppy the very best "
"Niles: I don't need this smug attitude of yours. I fully intended to discuss this amiably. You refuse, so I'll just say goodbye. "
"Frasier: Very well, thanks for dropping by, off you go. "
"Frasier: What kind of a fool does he take me for? He is obviously pursuing Regan, the man has the nerve to say he's chasing Poppy. "
"Daphne: Poppy? "
"Frasier: Yes, as if anyone could pursue that insufferable air hoi Well, if it's deceit and chicanery he's after, I'll give him more than he can handle. "
"Daphne: Dr. Crane, before it gets to that level, wouldn't it make sense for you two just to have one open and honest conversation? "
"Frasier: Honestly, Daphne, how you manage to overreact in absolutely everything "
"Roz: These shoes are killing me, I can't wait to sit down. "
"Frasier: Well, you're not going to sit there. "
"Roz: Why not? "
"Frasier: I'm expecting someone for coffee. "
"Roz: Well, Niles is small, we can share. "
"Frasier: It is not Niles, will you stop saying that? I'm meeting a woman. "
"Roz: Well, I'll move when she gets here. By the way, I still have four tickets left for that charity ball Friday night. "
"Frasier: I'm sorry, Roz, thanks anyway. "
"Roz: Come on, it's for a good cause. They provide disaster relief. "
"Poppy: Hi, partners Frasier, I was leaving the booth and I found this umbrella. I think it belongs to you. "
"Frasier: Yes, it's my emergency umbrella. I always leave it in the booth. "
"Poppy: Don't feel bad, I'm forgetful too "
"Frasier: I think I'll just go and see what's keeping my latte. Would you watch my table please, Roz? "
"Niles: Hello, Roz. I noticed that Poppy was here. Did she mention where she was headed? "
"Roz: No. Listen, Niles, can I interest you in a couple of tickets for a charity ball this Friday? It's a great event. "
"Niles: Is Frasier going? "
"Roz: No, but do you have to go everything together? "
"Niles: I'll take two. I'm in a hurry, I'll send you a check. "
"Frasier: Where was Niles in such a rush off to? "
"Roz: I have no idea. Last chance, I only have two tickets left. "
"Frasier: I thought there were four? "
"Roz: Niles just bought a pair. "
"Frasier: Damn him He's probably off to intercept Regan right now. "
"Roz: Who? "
"Frasier: I'm sorry, Roz, I'm in a hurry. I'll write you a check for these. Enjoy the table "
"TO: "
"Poppy: This is the best kind of party. You get to dress up, have a wonderful time, and it's all for a good cause. "
"Niles: You know it really is for an impressive organization. I've heard that within twenty-four hours of any worldwide disaster they can put together a ball. "
"Poppy: Oh, look it's your brother. "
"Niles: What? Oh, so it is. Why don't you find our table and I'll get us some champagne. "
"Poppy: Yes. "
"Niles: Roz, you didn't tell me Frasier was going to be here. "
"Roz: Yeah, he bought the last two tickets. "
"Niles: After he knew I'd be here with Poppy. Obviously he wants to get a shot at her himself, he bought that pull-a-long as his beard. "
"Roz: Frasier's interested in Poppy? "
"Niles: I shouldn't be surprised the subtle signs of attraction are lost on you. A woman for whom the gunning of a Harley engine is like a come-hither look. "
"Frasier: Hello, Roz. "
"Roz: Hi. "
"Frasier: I see that Niles has brought himself a 'date' to the evening. "
"Roz: Yep, and you'll never guess what he thinks. "
"Frasier: Oh, I know exactly what he thinks. He's using Poppy as his patty, steal a few minutes with Regan, try and win her for himself. "
"Roz: That's not what he thinks. "
"Frasier: Roz "
"Roz: He likes Poppy. "
"Frasier: Dear simple, Roz. After six years of listening at my feet. Have you learnt nothing of the dark forces that move people? Open your ears "
"TO: "
"Regan: You're looking at your brother again. "
"Frasier: Yes, I'm sorry. It's just that he keeps staring over here. For God's sakes, he hasn't paid any attention whatsoever. Can you imagine how that woman must feel? "
"Regan: Yeah, women hate that. "
"Niles: He's doing it again. "
"Poppy: What? "
"Niles: My brother is staring at us. Obviously thinking what a striking couple we make. In fact, let's give him something to stare at. "
"Poppy: I'm sorry. Same toe as before. "
"Niles: Yes, same toe as before. "
"floor: "
"Regan: What is going on with you two tonight? "
"Frasier: All right, you'd find out sooner or later anyway. See, I know about you and Niles. "
"Regan: You do? "
"Frasier: Yes. But it's all right, I don't mind. It's just that, well, he's really quite smitten with you. "
"Regan: Oh my God, really? "
"Poppy: Do you think you're going to lose the nail? "
"Niles: No, no, I just need to sit down. "
"Poppy: Oh my God, I love the tango. You won't mind if I dance one with your brother? "
"Niles: What? "
"Frasier: Well, actually Poppy... "
"Poppy: Oh come on, Niles can keep Regan company. "
"Niles: You know, Regan, I'm getting a second wind. Shall we show them how it's done? "
"Regan: Well, actually, Dr. Crane- "
"Niles: Oh, don't be so formal. We're not doctor and patient tonight "
"Poppy: Your brother's quite romantic, inviting me to a ball on our very first date. He certainly doesn't waste time, does he? "
"Frasier: No, he doesn't "
"Regan: You do realize that I'm interested in your brother. "
"Niles: You mean, you're developing real feelings for him? "
"Regan: Yeah. "
"Niles: Well, you might think so now, but trust "
"me: You're future's not with him. I know this is confusing. [twirls her round in a dizzy daze] You'll see everything more clearly when I've got you on the couch. "
"Regan: Oh "
"Niles: Well, I can't take anymore of this. "
"Niles: I have to cut in. "
"Poppy: How romantic "
"Niles: Yes, come with me. "
"Niles: You should be ashamed of yourself. "
"Frasier: Your tango wasn't so impressive, either. "
"Niles: I'm talking about your behaviour tonight. "
"Frasier: I won't simply stand aside and let you have the woman you want. "
"Niles: Exactly, obviously one of us has to back off, not just tonight but permanently. "
"Regan: Frasier, can I talk to you for a moment alone? "
"Frasier: Well, of course, just give me one more moment with my brother. "
"Poppy: Niles, when you're finished I'd love one more dance. "
"Niles: Ah, I'll be right there. "
"Niles: Well, I believe she has made her choice. "
"Frasier: Yes, I believe she has. "
"Regan: Frasier, I think I'd like to leave if that's all right. "
"Frasier: Leave? Already? Well, couldn't we just have one last dance? "
"Regan: Well, I guess. I'm just feeling a little uncomfortable. "
"Frasier: Yes, well, I certainly don't blame you. You see, now I've spoken with him, Niles has agreed to behave himself. Now I can put all my attention on you. "
"Regan: That is a relief. I mean, you can understand why I was kinda freaked out by all that. "
"Regan: Right? Frasier? "
"Frasier: He's a brave little soldier, isn't he? Awash in despair and yet he dances. "
"Poppy: This is when they wrote songs that were really about something. True love, broken hearts. "
"Niles: [referring to Frasier but arguably in his heart referring to the last time he was in the ball room and Daphne broke his heart] Yes, there's nothing quite so poignant as someone with a broken heart, pretending that it isn't. "
"Frasier: No wonder, he keeps staring over at us. He's suffered such a crushing defeat tonight. "
"Regan: Can we go? "
"Frasier: Yes, of course, that's the best thing to do. You know, let me just have one last word with him. "
"Regan: Oh my God "
"Frasier: Niles, if you don't mind. "
"Poppy: You guys are going to wear me out. "
"Frasier: Can I see you at the bar, please? "
"Regan: I think I'm going to catch a cab. "
"Poppy: Aren't you having a good time? "
"Regan: Frankly, no. Are you? "
"Poppy: Oh, yes, I think Niles has got quite a little crush on me. "
"Regan: Actually, Poppy, there's something you should know about Niles. "
"Frasier: Niles, I just wanted to let you know that I'm not happy with the way things have ended this evening. "
"Niles: Well, neither am I. How could I be? And the worst thing "
"is: it's not just tonight. What happens when we keep running into each other? "
"Frasier: Yes, the victor will have his trophy. The loser will be empty-handed. "
"Niles: It hardly seems worth it, given the permanent damage this could do to our relationship. "
"Frasier: Yes, I can't help but wonder if perhaps we're being a bit short-sighted. "
"Frasier: Niles, is that Regan and Poppy leaving just now? "
"Niles: It was, wasn't it? "
"Frasier: I want you to go after her. "
"Niles: What? "
"Frasier: Yes, I won't stand in your way. "
"Niles: No, Frasier, I would feel better if you went after her. "
"Frasier: No, I couldn't do that to you. "
"Niles: I think we're both feeling the same thing. "
"Frasier: I know we are. You noble bastard. "
"Niles: Right back atcha. Oh, it's for the best. "
"Frasier: After all, the most important thing is our friendship. "
"Niles: I think that's worth drinking to. Two bourbons. "
"Frasier: You know, while we're at it, let's propose a toast to the one pretty remarkable woman. "
"Niles: Well, she'd have to be to have won both of our hearts. "
"Frasier: Hear, hear. "
"Niles: Well, then... "
"Niles: To Regan/To Poppy "
"Frasier: I think we're going to need two more here. "

"Frasier: Hello, Roz. "
"Roz: Hey. "
"Frasier: Oh, what are you up to? "
"Roz: Oh, they put in phone jacks so you can go on-line. I was just talking to this guy who sounds really great. [Frasier sighs as if the idea is absurd] What? I'm a very busy person, how else am I going to meet people? "
"Frasier: It just seems so impersonal, Roz. God, what ever happened to human contact? Engaging people, face to face, eye to eye. "
"Roz: There's your dad. "
"Frasier: Don't let him see me [turns away as Martin crosses to the table] "
"Roz: Hey, Marty. "
"Martin: Hey, Roz. "
"Roz: Hey. "
"Martin: What you been up to? "
"Roz: Oh, just surfing the net. "
"Frasier: Hi, Dad. "
"Martin: You know, I never got into that net stuff. "
"Roz: Really? You really ought to give it a try. It's a great way to stay in touch with your friends and your family. "
"Martin: Family? Gosh, you know, that's nice to know that some people still care about their family. "
"Frasier: Dad, please "
"Martin: Well, I gotta go. I'm going night-fishing with Duke - and Eddie, of course I wouldn't leave Eddie, you don't turn your back on your family "
"Roz: What is that all about? "
"Frasier: Oh, our Cousin Dodie's wedding was last week. Oh, excuse me, Cousin Dodie's 'weddin'' A western theme. On the response card it asked for our chili "
"preference: mild or 'kick ass' Anyway, Niles and I told her that we had a conference to attend at the Therapist's Guild. "
"Roz: There is no Therapist's Guild, is there? "
"Frasier: No. Dad found us out. "
"Roz: Wait Didn't you have a Therapist Guild conference on Alice's last birthday? "
"Frasier: The point is, it struck a nerve with Dad I'm sorry, Roz, it's just that he thinks we're ashamed of his family, it's been an issue with him for years, and now he hasn't spoken to me for days. Thank God, I don't have to deal with this tonight. I've already ear-marked a fine bottle of Chateau Beychevelle. "
"Roz: Oh, hot date? "
"Frasier: No, Niles is coming over to watch 'The Antiques Roadshow' with me. "
"Roz: I guess you'll be coming in late, tomorrow "
"Frasier: It's our favorite show, Roz. "
"Roz: Party "
"Frasier: All right, that's enough. "
"Roz: Whoo "
"Frasier: I think the roadshow is from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania tonight. Amish country "
"Niles: Ooh, quilts "
"Frasier: I'll cork the wine, Niles, you set up the cheese cakes. "
"Niles: Dad "
"Frasier: I thought you were going night fishing with Duke? "
"Frasier: Oh, for God's sakes, you can't keep this up forever, Dad. Well, all right, fine. I hope you don't mind, but Niles and I are planning on watching a television show. "
"Martin: Oh, really? Well, I'm surprised you don't have a conference to go to "
"Frasier: Dad, we said we were sorry about Dodie's wedding. "
"Niles: Yes, and we did send her a baby gift. "
"Martin: Well, Duke cancelled out on me. You can have the TV in an hour. I just want to watch my game show. "
"Frasier: Oh please, not a game show? "
"Martin: Hey, I happen to like it, all right? People bring in all their junk from the attics and these experts tell them what it's worth. "
"Frasier: Are you talking about 'The Antiques Roadshow?' "
"Martin: Yeah. "
"Frasier: Well, that's the program Niles and I are going to watch "
"Niles: I'll just check outside and see if the world has ended. "
"Martin: Well, if you want to watch it, no one's stopping you. "
"Frasier: Well, wonderful. "
"Presenter: And you have no idea what this writing desk might be worth? "
"Woman: No, my husband bought it at a garage sale. "
"Frasier: That's a lovely piece. I'd say it's Sheridan. "
"Presenter: At auction, this would bring in more than eight thousand dollars. "
"Martin: Whoa-ho-ho Ca-ching "
"Woman: What about this chair? Is it an original too? "
"Niles: It certainly looks it. "
"Martin: Ah, no, they always do this. Set 'em up on the first one and then lower the boom on the second one. "
"Niles: I think that carving looks authentic. "
"Frasier: So does the inlay. "
"Martin: No, no, no "
"Presenter: I'm sorry to say this chair is a reproduction, worth at best one hundred and fifty dollars. "
"Woman: Oh, what a shame. "
"Martin: Keep watching, boys. You'll get the hang of it. "
"TO: "
"Presenter: But the real clue here is the veneer. ' and "
"Presenter: And now for some background information on the beautiful city of Harrisburg. "
"Martin: Mute "
"Daphne: Evening, all. Wow I don't see the three of you watching the same show very often. What's going on? Pavarotti jumping the Grand Canyon? "
"Martin: It's 'The Antiques Roadshow.' What you got in the box? "
"Daphne: Oh, it's Donny's mother's wedding gown. He wants me to wear it at the wedding. What if I don't like it? "
"Frasier: Daphne, if you want to try it on, we'll be glad to have a look. "
"Martin: Just go put it on. "
"Frasier: Dad, Dad, turn it up. "
"Briggs: But the real masterwork is the unique art deco headboard. It features a variety of veneers. ' and sip. "
"Briggs: Mahogany veneer... "
"Briggs: Burled walnut veneer... "
"Briggs: And zebra wood veneer. "
"Briggs: And now back to our... "
"Frasier: Oh God... next week we gotta pick a different word. Need another bottle of wine, Niles. "
"Martin: Yeah, me too, I love these educational shows. "
"Frasier: You know, I can't get over Dad. It seems this little rift between us has been mended. "
"Niles: Can you believe he used the word 'craftsman,' and he meant the architectural style, and not the rotary sander? "
"Frasier: You know, that's uncanny. "
"Niles: Well, you heard him. "
"Frasier: No, not that, you just said 'rotary sander.' "
"Frasier: Dad, did we miss anything? "
"Martin: Nah, just some bozo with a credenza who doesn't know a Biedermeier from an Oscar Meyer. "
"Presenter: That's it for this week. See you next time on 'The Antiques Roadshow.' Next Saturday the roadshow will be here in Seattle. "
"Martin: Oh "
"Presenter: Viewers can bring their treasures to the convention center for a free appraisal. "
"Martin: We oughta go, that'd be great. "
"Frasier: Well sure, Dad. "
"Niles: That does sound like fun. "
"Martin: Yeah, I'm going to go and have a little root around in our closet. I bet I can find a nice little [correct pronunciation] objet d'art they'd be interested in. "
"Niles: It's as if that panhandler I gave money to was a genie granting all my wishes. "
"Daphne: Would you marry me in this? "
"Frasier: How much did you give him? "
"Niles: It's attractive, Daphne. It's a bit unorthodox. "
"Daphne: Yeah. That's what I think. "
"Daphne: Donny, I've just put your mum's wedding dress on. A mini- skirt? It's obscene You can see my... What? No, I took the green box. I took the wrong dress. This is from his mother's third marriage in 1968 in Las Vegas. "
"Daphne: Can you believe people used to actually dress like this? "
"Niles: I wish I had a picture of it for whenever I needed a laugh. "
"Frasier: Niles "
"TO: "
"Martin: This bear clock's been in the family for generations, I can't wait to see how much it's worth. Do you think they'll put a dollar figure on it? "
"Frasier: Sounds about right. "
"Martin: Very funny, but you know, your grandpa passed this down to me and someday, when I'm gone, it'll be passed on to you. "
"Frasier: Dad, please, I don't even want to think about that day. "
"Martin: You know, I've got to see if I can go and get this baby appraised. "
"Niles: I am so sorry, but on the way in I had the most amazing celebrity "
"sighting: Hans Dietrich. "
"Frasier: The loveseat expert? "
"Niles: The very same. He's much smaller in person than on television. He's that big. "
"Frasier: Get out "
"Martin: Boys, come over here, they want to put me and the clock on TV. "
"Frasier: Good Lord, we can't appear on TV with that hideous thing. "
"Niles: Everyone we know watches this program. "
"Frasier: Thank God he didn't bring along that dreadful mounted jackrabbit's head with the antelope horns. "
"Niles: The Jackalope Texas's answer to the Minotaur. "
"Martin: So what do you think of that, boys? They said they've never seen anything like it. "
"Frasier: Dad, you know, this could go either way. "
"Martin: Oh, I know. I'm not going to act like one of those saps I make fun of. Doesn't matter if it's worth two dollars or two thousand, I'm just gonna say, 'That's pretty much what I figured.' "
"Martin: Guys, which one of you wants to come and hold this? "
"Frasier: No, no, Dad. We wouldn't dream of it. "
"Niles: This is your moment. "
"Director: Everybody ready? Action. "
"Appraiser: So, Martin, what can you tell us about this pewter clock? "
"Martin: Well, it is a clock set in the stomach of what appears to be a bear. "
"Appraiser: Actually, it's much more than that. It's Russian, made in the mid-nineteenth century. "
"Martin: That's pretty much what I figured. "
"Appraiser: Actually, it's a stunning piece. It was made by André Krogyn, who worked for Tsar Alexander II. "
"Martin: That is pretty much what I figured. "
"Appraiser: I don't know if you're descended from the Romanovs, Martin, but all of Krogyn's known bear clocks were done exclusively for the Romanov family and are now in the Hermitage Museum. "
"Appraiser: Martin, you may be surprised to learn that this clock at auction would easily bring $25,000. "
"Martin: Ca-ching "
"Frasier: What he means is, that's pretty much what we figured. "
"Frasier: After you, Dad. "
"Martin: Thank you. "
"Frasier: So, you know, Dad? I've been thinking, we should find an appropriate place for this clock. How about right here on this console? "
"Martin: Oh, I get it It doesn't look quite so bad to you guys now that it's worth twenty-five grand. Oh, I could kick myself for not bringing that Jackalope "
"Niles: What an amazing day, eh? "
"Frasier: It certainly was. You know, Niles, I was meaning to ask you about something. Remember the appraiser said something about the bear being from Russia, dad being part of the Romanov family? "
"Niles: Yeah, yeah, you know, that struck my ear too. "
"Frasier: Yes, although I don't seriously believe there's any real chance of that. "
"Niles: No, of course not. "
"Frasier: It's a long shot. "
"Niles: It's possible. "
"Frasier: Although we do have the bear. "
"Niles: I know. "
"Frasier: Oh, Dad. Niles just reminded me of something I completely forgot. When the appraiser mentioned that the bear was from Russia... "
"Martin: Oh, yeah. Well, it probably got passed down through your great-great grandmother. She was from Russia. "
"Frasier: A-ha, he said something about the Romanov family? "
"Martin: Oh, yeah, that, eh? Are you sure you want to hear about this? "
"Niles: Yes, Dad. "
"Martin: Well, I guess you would have found out anyway after I died... We're royalty. "
"Martin: But I didn't want you to grow up spoiled, so I abdicated and took a job in Seattle on the police force. [the brothers realize his joke] It was kinda hard giving up that royal way of life, but I think maybe it's the swans that I miss most. "
"Frasier: Very funny, Dad. Point taken. Sherry, Niles? [crosses to sherry] "
"Niles: Please. "
"Martin: I'm sorry to disappoint you. I know you'd rather be anything else in the world except Cranes "
"Frasier: Dad Now that is just not true, we are proud to be Cranes. It's just innocent curiosity. "
"Martin: Well, I gotta go call Duke. But don't get excited, he's not a real Duke. "
"Niles: Well, we stepped in it that time. "
"Frasier: Yes, what the hell is wrong with us? Asking whether we are related to the Romanovs. We just got past this whole Crane shame thing. "
"Niles: We should have known it'd just upset him. "
"Frasier: Yes, and for what? Trying to find some distant connection to royalty. "
"Niles: Even if we can prove it, what do we have? "
"Frasier: Huh, a story to tell at parties. "
"Niles: An occasional seat at a state dinner. "
"Frasier: Some meaningless title. It's insane. "
"Niles: Ridiculous... destructive. "
"Frasier: Still, there is this grandmother. "
"Niles: I'm right behind you. "
"Frasier: You know, Niles, given our new pride in the Crane name, perhaps it would behoove us to research our family tree. "
"Niles: Actually, in a way we'd be honoring Dad. "
"Frasier: Yes, of course we wouldn't need to tell him. "
"Niles: No. "
"Frasier: Just a few hours on the internet, a trip to the library, we could sketch in the entire family tree. "
"Niles: And if there should happen to be a connection [breathless with glee] to the Romanovs... "
"Frasier: Well, what harm is there in that? "
"Frasier: It is amusing to contemplate, isn't it, Niles? You, me, Dad - all part of an ancient noble family. "
"Martin: Okay Eddie, the jackalope’s gonna get ya The jackalope is gonna get ya "
"TO: "
"Roz: Hey, Frasier. How's the research going? "
"Frasier: Oh, sit down, Roz. I'll bring you up to speed. "
"Roz: No, thank you. I'm meeting someone. "
"Frasier: Good God Not one of your internet dalliances? "
"Roz: It's just coffee, okay? Listen, this guy's totally legit, he e-mailed me his picture. "
"Frasier: A picture? Oh, for God's sakes, Roz, what can you learn from a picture? The man's probably a lunatic, a psychopath... Oh, he's a pretty boy. "
"Roz: Yeah. "
"Frasier: Wait... I know this photo. It's the cover of this month's Bidwell's catalogue "
"Roz: Are you sure? "
"Frasier: I'm positive, I ordered those socks and driving shoes "
"Roz: How could someone do this? "
"Frasier: Well, it's probably some insecure would-be Romeo trying to lure you into a meeting. "
"Noel: Hello, Frasier. "
"Frasier: Noel. "
"Noel: What have we here? An empty seat next to yours. May I? "
"Roz: No Of all the dumbass things you've done to get me to go out with you, e-mailing me this picture is just the most moronic "
"Noel: But, Roz- "
"Roz: Forget it, buddy "
"Roz: I ought to take your mouse cord and wrap it around your nerdy little neck until your eyes pop out like champagne corks "
"Noel: But I didn't send you this. "
"Roz: Yeah right, then who did? "
"Noel: My guess would be... that guy. "
"Roz: Oh my God Oh, Noel, I'm so sorry. "
"Noel: How sorry? "
"Roz: Not that sorry. "
"Niles: I just saw the Bidwell's guy "
"Frasier: Yes. Well Niles, how goes the research? "
"Niles: Oh, I think you're going to be very pleased. According to this catalogue of Russian antiquities, the bear clock was last seen in Moscow in 1879. "
"Frasier: Well, hold on to your fur hat, Niles. I just discovered that our great-great grandmother emigrated from Russia... 1879 "
"Niles: My God, it's all coming together. I can practically picture the scene. "
"Frasier: Yes. "
"Niles: Our great-great grandmother, smelling revolution in the wind... "
"Frasier: Secretly slips away in the black Russian night... "
"Niles: Taking the bear clock with her to remind her of better days. "
"Frasier: Yes The ticking hands of time counting down her return, her royal power merely hibernating. [Frasier's mobile sounds, he answers] Yes? Yes, yes, I'll hold. "
"Niles: Who is it? "
"Frasier: It's Dr. Myshkin. He's an attaché at the Russian embassy, also an expert on the Romanovs. Yes, Dr. Myshkin. This evening would be fine. About seven ó clock. Yes, I live in the Elliot Bay Towers. I'll see you then. He has some important information for us. My God, Niles, this is it. The final link to our royal past. I'm going to issue a press release "
"Niles: Not before I shout it from the rooftops [notices Martin entering] Here's Dad, hide everything "
"Martin: Hey guys, I thought I'd find you here. You know, you just missed seeing yourselves on 'The Antiques Roadshow.' [They fake noises of disappointment] And you know, the phone's been ringing off the hook, everybody wants to buy that bear clock. "
"Frasier: You're not thinking of selling it, are you? "
"Martin: You're damn right I am Some guy just offered me twenty-six thousand for it. I'm gonna buy me a big, honking fishing boat, with a Wave Pounder 450 and a fun deck. Good for fishin', crusin', or just plain tubin' "
"Niles: Did you hear that Frasier? We can go tubin'. [Mouths to Frasier 'Do Something'] "
"Frasier: You know, Dad, perhaps Niles and I could sell the clock for you. I mean, we do know the antiques world and you know, we could get you more than twenty-six thousand. "
"Martin: Oh "
"Niles: I should think at least thirty thousand. "
"Martin: Huh. You know, maybe I will let you boys handle this. "
"Frasier: Wise move, Dad. "
"Niles: Yeah, we'd hate to see you get manipulated. "
"TO: "
"Myshkin: Dr. Crane. "
"Frasier: Dr. Myshkin, please. Come in. This is my brother, Dr. Niles Crane. "
"Myshkin: Oh, there it is. "
"Frasier: Please, have a look. Is it authentic? "
"Myshkin: Without a doubt. "
"Niles: Frasier... "
"Frasier: I know. "
"Frasier: Daphne, you know, there is some caviar on the ice in the kitchen. Now would be the appropriate time, if you would, please? "
"Daphne: Oh, I am so sorry. Here I am, dawdling with the laundry when it's ten minutes into caviar time "
"Myshkin: As I mentioned, I have some information which should be very interesting to you. "
"Frasier: Yes, yes, please make yourself comfortable. Do tell, tell. "
"Myshkin: This is a copy of the diary of Princess Sonia Romanov, daughter to Tsar Alexander II. At eighteen she fell in love with a commoner, an American. [Niles mouths 'Our grandmother' to Frasier] Their union, of course, was forbidden, but Sonia decided to give everything up for love. "
"Frasier: Quel elegance. "
"Myshkin: She enlisted the aid of a scullery maid, who smuggled money, clothing and this bear clock out of the palace. "
"Niles: She would elope to America "
"Myshkin: Yes, that was her plan, but when Sonia found her way to the train station under the cover of night, the scullery maid absconded with everything, including the clock. "
"Niles: Servants "
"Frasier: There's a back aching for the lash "
"Daphne: I'm moving as fast as I can "
"Frasier: Now, tell us. How did we get our clock back? "
"Niles: Yes, tell us, how did Great-Great-Grandmamma retrieve it? "
"Myshkin: Uh, Drs. Crane... your ancestor is not the princess, your ancestor is the scullery maid. "
"Myshkin: Well, on behalf of the Russian people, I thank you for retrieving this for us. "
"Frasier: You mean, you're just going to take it? "
"Myshkin: Well, its rightful place is in the Hermitage Museum. "
"Niles: But this clock has been in our family for generations... "
"Frasier: Niles. "
"Myshkin: Dr. Crane, we could settle this in the courts, but you wouldn't win. Do you really want this to come out in the press? "
"Frasier: Well, do you really expect us just to let you walk out of here with a precious family heirloom? "
"Myshkin: Did I mention that your ancestor, before she married a Noah Crane in 1882, worked as a prostitute in New York? "
"Frasier: Enjoy your bear. "
"Martin: Oh, hello. "
"Myshkin: Dr. Profiry Myshkin. "
"Martin: Marty Crane. I see you've got the clock. "
"Myshkin: That's right. Good evening, all. "
"Martin: Bye. "
"Martin: You sold it I hope you got a good price. "
"Frasier: Gee, Dad, I hope you didn't buy a boat. "
"Martin: No, I was thinking about it and then I thought, oh hell. We've been getting along so well... And you don't like fishing. And you get seasick. Why not get something we can all enjoy, you know? "
"Martin: So I bought this "
"Niles: A Winnebago "
"Martin: Yeah "
"Frasier: A big one "
"Martin: Thirty-three footer, with air suspension and power jacks. Thirty thousand used, but you got that much for the clock, right? "
"Frasier: Of course. "
"Martin: Oh, that's great. We can go anywhere. You know, the first place I want to go is Elmo, Nebraska. We got a whole mess of cousins down there "
"Frasier: Well... we're out fifteen thousand each. "
"Niles: And we have to take long trips in a Winnebago. "
"Frasier: And we're not Romanovs. We're descended from thieves and whores. "
"Niles: You know, I remember reading that Henry James once had a liaison with a Russian prostitute in New York. "
"Frasier: I'm right behind you. "

"Niles: I can't believe how cold it is in here. "
"Frasier: Niles, the climate control is on, it's perfectly comfortable. "
"Niles: Oh, really? Touch your tongue to the seat belt, I dare you. "
"Frasier: I'm starting to regret I even asked you to this exhibit. I wanted to invite Regan, but after the disaster I made of our first date I just felt too ashamed to even ask. "
"Niles: Well, you can't avoid her forever, she's your neighbor. Ask her again, what's the worst thing that can happen? "
"Frasier: She'd ask me to stop harassing her, which would mean I'd have to spend the next six months riding in the service elevator with Guillermo and his three-legged cat "
"Niles: How is little Wobbles? "
"Frasier: Fine. "
"Frasier: I see what you're doing, Niles If you're so cold there's a scarf in the glove compartment. "
"Niles: Oh, really? I thought that's where you kept the butter and the eggs. "
"Frasier: Well, now it's burning up in here I'm gonna take this coat off. "
"Niles: Are you insane? "
"Niles: At least wait until we've stopped... "
"Frasier: Take the wheel "
"Niles: I'll take the wheel but... Frasier, stop. Stop "
"Frasier: No, it's almost off. "
"Niles: No, I mean brake, brake "
"Niles: Are you all right? "
"Frasier: Yes. Thank heavens your fist softened the blow of the airbag "
"Phil: Hurt your nose? "
"Frasier: Yes. "
"Phil: That's what I figured. Right when you came in, I said, 'That guy hurt his nose.' So how did you, you know... "
"Frasier: Excuse me. "
"Frasier: Yes, hello, this is Dr. Frasier Crane here. I was just wondering, I filled out my paperwork about half an hour ago. "
"Receptionist: They'll call you. We're seeing people in order of importance. "
"Frasier: Oh really, well, I do have my own radio show. "
"Receptionist: The importance of the injury "
"Frasier: Yes, of course. "
"Niles: Do you know, are there any plastic surgeons on call? "
"Frasier: Oh Niles, that's not necessary. "
"Niles: Can't be too careful, could be broken. "
"Receptionist: Don't worry, the best plastic surgeons in town have their offices here. Dr. Rab, Dr. Karnofsky and Dr. Burke. "
"Niles: Karnofsky? Mel Karnofsky? "
"Receptionist: That's right. "
"Niles: Maris's plastic surgeon. Would you believe that charlatan is still picking my pocket a year after my divorce? "
"Frasier: Good Lord, for what? "
"Niles: Oh, for Maris's botox injections. They use those botcholeanen toxins that you put in the forehead, it deadens the muscles and takes away the wrinkles. I gave it to her as a gift one year for our anniversary. "
"Frasier: Oh, yes, probably your tenth. That's toxins, isn't it? "
"Niles: Anyway, Karnofsky keeps billing me for her follow-up injections. "
"Frasier: Good Lord. "
"Phil: So you're divorced, huh? "
"Niles: Yes. "
"Phil: Me too, I'm Phil. [puts his hand out, Niles doesn't reciprocate] Fourteen years together. Came home one day and... oh hell, I probably shouldn't even talk about it. "
"Niles: Okay. "
"Frasier: You know, Niles, seeing as how we're here, why don't you go and find this Karnofsky and straighten this whole thing out? "
"Niles: No, no, I can't leave you here injured. "
"Frasier: That's all right, Niles, I'll be fine. "
"Niles: Are you sure? I may just pay Dr. Karnofsky a visit. "
"Frasier: You know, it really is outrageous what these scalpel jockeys get away with; convincing women like Maris to spend fortunes on their exterior, when frankly what they need is to take a good look at the woman inside. "
"Niles: Right. Well, she did have one chemical pill where you could see her kidneys for a while. "
"Frasier: Off you go. Good luck, Niles. "
"Niles: Thank you. "
"Phil: Not a pretty woman, my wife, but when she danced you couldn't keep your eyes off her. "
"Frasier: You know, actually I'm feeling a lot better, goodbye "
"Nurse: Frasier Crane? Frasier Crane, we're ready to see you. "
"Phil: That's me "
"TO: "
"Niles: Ah, Dr. Karnofsky, I see you've decided to make time for me "
"Clerk: Sorry, I'm from Records. I was told to bring over Maris Crane's files. That's this year. "
"Mel: Dr. Crane? "
"Niles: Yes. "
"Mel: I'm so sorry to keep you waiting. Melinda Karnofsky. "
"Niles: Oh, yes, of course, Niles Crane. About this billing issue...? "
"Mel: Oh my God, this box is filthy. "
"Niles: Yes, the problem is I have received three invoices over the past six months. "
"Mel: Yes, I'm so sorry about that. And I'm so sorry about all this dust. Do you mind, I'll have to turn on my hepafilter? "
"Niles: Oh, you have a hepa... You have a Svenson "
"Mel: Yes. They're great, aren't they? "
"Niles: Not to mention impossible to get in this country, I've tried. "
"Mel: Well, I once did a favor for Mrs. Svenson. Oh, it's a long story. "
"Niles: I'm all ears. "
"Mel: So was she. Anyway, I've spoken to the accounting department about your bill and it was clearly our mistake. Please accept our apology, we'll take care of it. "
"Niles: I appreciate that. "
"Niles: Oh, I like that print very much. "
"Niles: Everything all right? "
"Mel: I'm sorry, I just noticed a smudge on my jacket. [points to an invisible mark] "
"Niles: It's barely noticeable. "
"Mel: You're being kind. "
"Mel: I got that print at the last museum show. "
"Niles: Oh, I thought you looked familiar. Perhaps I've seen you there. "
"Mel: Perhaps. I go to all of the openings, I'm on the museum board. "
"Niles: Really? Well, congratulations. All the exhibits this year have been... "
"Niles: Perfection "
"Mel: Well, thank you. "
"Niles: I particularly like the Picasso. I'm a big fan of his Cubist period. "
"Mel: Oh, striking, isn't she? Yes, I'd like to think if she came in here I could have actually helped her. You must think I'm terribly fussy. "
"Niles: Yes. "
"Mel: Anyway, it was very nice meeting you. "
"Niles: Likewise. "
"Nurse: Dr. Karnofsky, Mrs. Magreshack has a question for you in room three. "
"Niles: Helen Magreshack? "
"Mel: Oh, I really can't say. "
"Niles: Oh. She's finally having it removed? "
"Mel: Why did she wait? "
"Niles: I don't know "
"Clerk: Found '98. "
"Niles: Actually, that's all been settled. Can you tell me, is that her husband? "
"Clerk: No, she's divorced. That's her son. "
"Niles: Really? Dr. Karnofsky's so young, she must have had him when she was a child. "
"Clerk: Okay. "
"Mel: Oh, was there something else? "
"Niles: Er, no. Er, no. Well- "
"Mel: Yes? "
"Niles: Mel, er... I was wondering, I, er... "
"Niles: Thank you. Er, I'm not really sure how to ask. "
"Mel: I think I know what it is. "
"Niles: A-ha. "
"Mel: And you've got no reason to be nervous. "
"Niles: Oh, really? "
"Mel: Yes. Just a few quick injections and those nasty little wrinkles in your forehead will disappear. "
"Mel: Well, that is what you were going to ask, isn't it? "
"Niles: Yes. "
"Mel: Well, it's a very simple procedure. Although your forehead will be numb for a while. I can fit you in at four-thirty. "
"Niles: Oh good, that gives me time to do something I need to do. "
"Mel: Excellent... "
"TO: "
"Daphne: Hello, Dr. Crane. "
"Niles: Hello, Daphne. I was on my way home, I thought I'd see how the patient was doing. "
"Frasier: Oh, I'm fine, thank you, Niles. "
"Niles: You have no idea how guilty I'm feeling. I suppose he told you it was my fist that struck in the inadvertent yet powerful blow. "
"Frasier: So how did things go with the nefarious Dr. Karnofsky? Did you give him a piece of your mind? "
"Niles: Actually he turned out to be a she, and quite a reasonable she at that. "
"Frasier: Really? That's quite a turnabout. "
"Niles: Yes, well... "
"Daphne: Dr. Crane, don't move. "
"Niles: Why? "
"Daphne: There's a mosquito. "
"Niles: Where? "
"Daphne: On your forehead. "
"Niles: Uh-oh Get off, get off. "
"Daphne: It's already gone. "
"Niles: Oh. "
"Daphne: Oh dear, looks like it bit you. "
"Niles: All right... Ow "
"Frasier: Niles, wrinkle your forehead for me, will you? "
"Niles: Why would I do that? "
"Frasier: Just do it. Wrinkle your forehead. "
"Niles: I'm not your marionette "
"Frasier: You got a botox injection You've got a forehead full of poison right now, don't you? "
"Niles: I do not "
"Daphne: Well, that's strange. The mosquito fell right out of the air, dead. "
"Martin: What's a botox injection? "
"Frasier: Oh, it's a cosmetic procedure they use to eliminate facial wrinkles. "
"Martin: Oh great, my kids are having plastic surgery. That's a nice age to get to. "
"Frasier: I can't believe you let Maris's witch doctor work her magic on you. "
"Niles: Mel is a perfectly lovely person In fact, I was screwing my courage up to ask her on a date when she noticed this little flaw and I lost my nerve. "
"Frasier: Yes, and most of the feeling in your face as well "
"Daphne: Dr. Crane, look, your picture's on the news. "
"Frasier: Well, turn it up, Dad, turn it up. "
"Crane: 1952 - 1999.' "
"Anchor: After checking into the hospital with what appeared to be minor injuries from a fender-bender, radio psychiatrist Frasier Crane died suddenly today. I'm sure it goes for all of us here at KYLL when I say he'll be sorely missed. But this rain won't be missed, will it, Flip? "
"Frasier: Dear God "
"Martin: What the hell? "
"Daphne: That's unbelievable "
"Niles: Outrageous "
"Frasier: As it turns out, after I left the hospital some poor devil used my name to jump the line and he dropped dead of a heart attack. I must say, it does seem a bit strange having plunged all of Seattle, albeit temporarily, into so much grief. "
"Roz: I know, I'll never forget where I was when I heard you had died. I was out on the street. There was this crowd watching a television through a department store window, and before I knew it, we were weeping and hugging each other. "
"Frasier: Very amusing, Roz "
"Roz: And then it began to rain, and I had this feeling that all the angels were crying. "
"Frasier: Yes, all right, Roz "
"Martin: Hey, Roz. Fras, have you seen this? "
"Frasier: Yes, as a matter of fact, I did. It's my obituary. "
"Roz: They printed it? "
"Frasier: Yes, they must have picked it up off the wire last night before the news ran that correction. "
"Martin: Jimmy gave it to me at McGinty's. Boy, everybody was so nice to me, buying me beers and everything. You know, because of the shock I went through thinking I'd lost my son. "
"Frasier: Dad, what are you talking about? You didn't think I was dead "
"Martin: Well, people don't have to know that. I could have been at home alone, wondering where you were and I get this strange uneasy feeling. So I turn on the TV and there it is on the "
"screen: the face of my dead son. "
"Frasier: But I was sitting right beside you "
"Martin: Well, what kinda story is that? "
"Frasier: It's the truth "
"Martin: Well, the truth doesn't put anything on a coaster "
"Roz: Well, there's something for your scrapbook, huh? Your own obituary. "
"Frasier: Yes, well... you know, frankly, it’s-it's a little upsetting. "
"Roz: I don't think they meant to be insulting, you are 'lovably pompous.' "
"Frasier: Not that. It's just, seeing all my life in black and white, it just all looks a little incomplete. "
"Roz: What do you mean? "
"Frasier: Well, I was going to do so much with my life. I was going to write a novel, run for public office, I was gonna do my own translation of Freud... "
"Roz: Well, what's stopping you? You're not actually dead. "
"Frasier: I guess you're right. You know, maybe that's a good way of looking at this actually, more of a wake-up call. "
"Lady: Dr. Crane, I was so relieved to hear that you're all right. "
"Frasier: Well, thank you. "
"Lady: I heard the news and I thought, 'What a shame, why he is such a young man.' "
"Frasier: That's so nice of you. Thank you, thank you so much. You know, you're right. What am I doing frittering away my day here in this coffee house? You know, I've got things to do. I've got fresh world to conquer. I'm going to go out there and grab life by the scrub. Look out destiny, here I come "
"Frasier: Well, it's really coming down out there. "
"TO: "
"Daphne: What happened to your clothes? Did you spill something on yourself? "
"Frasier: No, no, no, I'm going jogging later. "
"Daphne: No need to be sarcastic, just give me the clothes and I'll do another load. "
"Frasier: No, I'm serious, Daphne. I plan to go running just after I finish my obituary. It's a self- actualizing exercise. You write your obituary the way you'd like it to appear - years from now, of course - and then it helps you to focus your goals. Here they are, all my hopes and dreams. "
"Daphne: These are dreams, all right. [laughs, then reads] 'Dr. Crane came late to athletics, he became a fixture in the Seattle marathon, the America's Cup yacht race, as well as the Kentucky Derby.' A jockey at your size You better start writing an obituary for the horse. "
"Frasier: Very amusing, Daphne. I meant as a stable owner. "
"Martin: Hey Fras. What you do? Spill something on your clothes? "
"Frasier: No, I'm going jogging later. "
"Martin: Well, there's no need to get sarcastic about it. "
"Frasier: I'm serious, Dad, I'm going to have to start somewhere if I plan to run a marathon "
"Martin: Ooh, we've got a new basket? Hickory Farms "
"Daphne: Yes, that one came this afternoon. "
"Frasier: Dad, we agreed that we were going to send back all the condolence baskets intact. "
"Martin: I know, I know, but, you know, if a can of pecans falls out here and there, who's going to notice? Oh, by the way. Guess who I ran into? That friend of yours from next door, Regan. "
"Frasier: Really? "
"Martin: Yeah. You know, she was pretty relieved to hear you weren't dead. You know, maybe there's still something going on there. "
"Frasier: Oh, I don't know, Dad. I'd like to believe that, but I'm just too much of a realist. "
"Daphne: Tell that the two million people a year who visit 'Frasier Land.' "
"Frasier: It's a website, it teaches children about psychiatry "
"Martin: Hi. "
"Niles: Oh, hi Dad. I can't stay, I just realized I think I left my cell phone here last night. "
"Daphne: Oh, yeah, I did see it somewhere. Let me just have a look for it... "
"Niles: Why are you wearing running clothes? "
"Martin: He won't tell us "
"Daphne: Here it is. It was buried back here underneath all these baskets. "
"Martin: Oh, Daph Look what you did Rooting around in there, you poked a hole right through this... [Martin quite obviously punches a big hole through the cellophane on purpose] Hickory Farms basket We can't send it back now [He takes it to his chair.] "
"Niles: Thank you, Daphne. "
"Frasier: Niles. "
"Niles: Yes? "
"Frasier: Is that a bandage sticking out of your shirt? "
"Niles: Oh, where? "
"Frasier: Well, right there. "
"Niles: Oh yes, I cut myself shaving. "
"Frasier: On the back of your neck? You went to see Karnofsky again, didn't you? "
"Niles: Yes, I did I was going to ask her out again, when I got all flustered and I caught her staring at this grotesque carbuncle. "
"Frasier: Carbuncle? You mean that miniscule mole of yours. "
"Niles: Well, to you. I've always been self-conscious about it. I've made many a hasty wine selection because I felt the sommelier staring down at it. "
"Frasier: Oh, please. Just knock this off. Isn't it time you just asked the woman out? "
"Niles: Frasier, I'm just waiting until the moment's right. "
"Frasier: Like you did with Daphne? "
"Frasier: Oh, Niles, I am sorry. But I'd like to see you do this while I can still pick you out of a crowd. You know, I've got tickets for the opera tonight. Why don't you ask her to join you? "
"Niles: Oh, I don't know. "
"Frasier: Come on. Take a cue from me, I'm completely reinventing myself. You know what, if I can learn a new language, write a bestseller, well then surely you can ask this woman out. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a marathon to train for "
"Martin: Are you all right, Fras? "
"Frasier: I'm fine. "
"Martin: What happened? "
"Niles: Well, I think he tripped on one of these baskets. "
"Martin: Did you break anything? "
"Frasier: I don't think so. "
"Martin: Because, if you broke it, there's no point sending this one back either. "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Oh, dear God. "
"Martin: Look at you. They gave you a sweet one. All shiny and with no scuffs. Still has that new cane smell. "
"Frasier: Play your cards right, I might let you take it for a spin around the lobby. "
"Martin: Well, what they say? "
"Frasier: Oh, just a little sprain. It's gonna take a couple of weeks. "
"Frasier: I guess I'm going to have to rethink my life's plan a bit. "
"Martin: Oh, you're gonna be doing all this stuff? "
"Frasier: Well, of course, Dad, why wouldn't I? "
"Martin: Oh, I don't know. It just seems all so complicated. The first one you tried was kind of a bust. "
"Frasier: Yes, well you know, I've just got to scale things back a little bit. Set my sights on more attainable goals. For instance, "
"here: 'Visit South America.' That's in. 'Discover the lost treasure of the Incas.' That's out. 'Take up rafting.' That's in. 'Retrace Lewis and Clarke's Route.' That's out. And all this perpetual motion stuff, all this can go. "
"Frasier: Daphne "
"Martin: Oh no, she's out for the whole evening. You're gonna have to get it yourself. "
"Frasier: Oh, all right. "
"Martin: Let's see how that thing handles the corners. Come on, open her up "
"Niles: Hello Frasier, I'd like you to meet Dr. Mel Karnofsky. "
"Frasier: Well, I can't tell you what a pleasure this is. "
"Niles: I believe you have some opera tickets for us. "
"Frasier: Yes, I do. "
"Niles: Oh, Mel, this is my father, Martin. "
"Mel: Thank you. We're very grateful for this. Niles and I happen to be such huge fans of Puccini. "
"Martin: Speaking of which, here is our own little 'Pooch-ini' "
"Frasier: So, where are you two having dinner? "
"Mel: Bel Canto, we have a table on the terrace. "
"Frasier: Terrace? Well, I didn't know they had a terrace. "
"Mel: Really? Well I guess you have to know the owner. But, we better be going. I've pre-ordered our chocolate soufflés and they'll be ready at seven-thirty precisely. "
"Frasier: Well, off you go then. Just remember, Niles, nothing puts on love handles faster than chocolate soufflé. "
"Mel: Oh well, you know, no one takes them off faster than I do. "
"Frasier: Very funny, lovely meeting you. "
"Frasier: Well, she seems a bit much. "
"Martin: What do you mean? "
"Frasier: Well, picking the restaurant, dining on the terrace, you have to know the owner. Doesn't she remind you of someone? "
"Martin: Yeah, you "
"Frasier: I was talking about Maris. "
"Martin: Oh, come on, don't you think you're overreacting a little bit? I mean, Niles sure seems happy. "
"Frasier: Yes, you're right, Dad. In fact, I've got a lot to accomplish this evening. Tonight, I'm going to start on my Russian language tapes. "
"Frasier: What is it, Dad? "
"Martin: What? Nothing. "
"Frasier: What, don't you think I can do any of these things? "
"Martin: No, I think you can do anything you put your mind to, Frasier, you always have. "
"Frasier: Thank you, Dad. "
"Martin: I just wonder about all these projects. "
"Frasier: Well, as I said, I am streamlining. "
"Martin: You know, I think what you discovered this week was that something's missing from your life. And before you start to fill it up with everything but the kitchen sink, I thought you ought to just ask yourself, 'what do I really want? What is really going to make me happy... now?' "
"Martin: Well, that's weird. I suddenly feel like having a beer. "
"Frasier: Regan, it's me, Frasier "

"Roz: Morning, Fras. "
"Frasier: Hi, Roz. Roz, is baby Alice dressed as a little turkey or am I just very, very hungry? "
"Roz: We're flying home for Thanksgiving right after the show. I thought I'd make Alice look as cute as possible so if she cries on the plane, the other passengers can't get mad. Actually, what I like to do is keep her awake so she'll sleep on the plane. "
"Frasier: You know, you should just do what I used to do. I used to tell the passengers that if Frederick cried, I'd buy them all a drink. "
"Roz: And that worked? "
"Frasier: Oh, yes. In fact, one time I awoke from a short nap, and the fellow sitting behind us was flicking the back of Frederick's little ear. Of course that was cheating, the man did not get his drink. "
"Roz: So when is Frederick coming anyway? "
"Frasier: Well, Lilith is dropping him off around noon and then she's off to visit a colleague for Thanksgiving in Vancouver. You know, come to think of it, do they even celebrate Thanksgiving in Canada? "
"Roz: They will when she leaves "
"Freddie: Hi, Dad. "
"Frasier: Frederick, hi. "
"Lilith: Hello, Frasier. "
"Frasier: Hello. Oh, gosh, you know, I was starting to get worried about you. You’re an hour late. "
"Freddie: We saw a big accident on the freeway. Mom saved this guy's life. "
"Frasier: Really? "
"Lilith: Well, that's going a bit far. I simply applied a tourniquet. "
"Freddie: She's a hero. "
"Frasier: Yes, that's your mother all right, son. "
"Freddie: Then the paramedics came and wanted to give mom a transfusion. "
"Frasier: Yes, that's your mother all right, son. "
"Lilith: If you don't mind, I'd like to use the phone and call my colleague and tell him I'll be late. "
"Frasier: Yes, of course. Who is this colleague anyway? "
"Lilith: He's the man who supplies me with lab rats. It's about time we got together socially. I've known him for over fifty-two generations. "
"Frasier: Ah. Well, if the drumsticks are about this big [shows a couple of centimeters with his fingers], you'll know why. "
"Freddie: Good one, Dad. "
"Frasier: Thank you, son. "
"Lilith: Hello, Peter, it's Lilith. Listen, I'm running about an hour late, so... Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Well, take care of yourself. Okay. Goodbye. "
"Frasier: What happened? "
"Lilith: Peter's come down with something. He thinks he caught it from the rats. "
"Frasier: Oh, now, nobody caught anything from a rat that wasn't resolved in a day or two, off you go. "
"Freddie: Gee, mom, why don't you spend Thanksgiving with us? "
"Frasier: Yes, that's a very good one, Frederick. Go kiss your mother goodbye and unpack, all right? "
"Lilith: Would it be so unbearable for me to be here for one meal? As soon as we're done, I'll go and check into a hotel. I can spend the weekend working on an article I've been writing. "
"Frasier: Well, you know, Niles is coming this afternoon, and it'll be very uncomfortable, I think. You know, you two haven't seen each other since your little tryst. "
"Lilith: Oh please, Niles and I are adults. "
"Frasier: I suppose you're right. It would mean a lot to Frederick. After all, Thanksgiving is a time to celebrate family. "
"Martin: Is the witch gone yet? "
"Frasier: Lilith's still here, Dad. "
"Martin: Oh, in that case, I'll ask you too, Lilith. Has my twitch gone yet? I had some very strong coffee this morning and... "
"Lilith: Skillfully done, Martin. "
"Freddie: Grandpa "
"Martin: Oh, Freddie How ya doing? "
"Freddie: So, Dad, is Mom staying for dinner? "
"Lilith: Yes, Frederick, I am. "
"Freddie: Isn't that great, Grandpa? "
"Martin: Great, Freddie Real great Isn't that great, Freddie? "
"Freddie: Are you okay, Grandpa? "
"Lilith: He's worried about his twitch "
"Daphne: Come on, Eddie, come on. "
"Frasier: What's the matter? "
"Daphne: Well, he was perfectly fine until a block from here. Then he started whining and trembling, like he senses an earthquake or a dark force or- hello, Lilith - a vortex of evil. "
"Freddie: I'll help with the groceries. "
"Daphne: Well, let's see how the turkey's coming. "
"Frasier: Yes, Daphne's preparing dinner. "
"Lilith: Oh, should we tell her there's an extra person? "
"Frasier: No need. "
"Niles: Hello, Frasier. "
"Niles: Hello, Lilith. Lovely to see you again. "
"Lilith: Nice to see you, too. "
"Niles: I trust your flight was uneventful? "
"Lilith: Up, down, bumpy over the mountains. "
"Niles: Isn't that always the way? "
"Frasier: Lilith is joining us for dinner, Niles. "
"Niles: What a nice surprise. "
"Lilith: It certainly is for me. "
"Niles: Well, not as nice as it is for me. "
"Frasier: Oh, stop it, both of you I refuse to spend the day listening to your distilled chatter "
"Niles: Well, how would you have us behave? "
"Frasier: Well, why don't you try going back to your former relationship? "
"Lilith: All we did was insult each other. "
"Frasier: Yes You're willing to throw all that away just because of one ill-considered night of passion? It happened, take from it what you can learn, move on "
"Niles: Well, I learned if you kiss her too fast you get an ice-cream headache. "
"Lilith: You also learned that I have twice your upper body strength, so shut your pie hole "
"Frasier: Was that so hard? "
"TO: "
"Martin: Wait, wait, what are you doing? "
"Daphne: I'm mashing the potatoes. "
"Martin: By hand? You're supposed to whip potatoes, therefore every bite tastes the same. "
"Daphne: Isn't that a bit bland? "
"Martin: Hello? Welcome to potatoes Could you just once cook a traditional Thanksgiving meal? I mean, look at this cranberry sauce. It's supposed to keep the shape of the can, quiver a little bit. What are all these little chunks in there? "
"Daphne: Those are cranberries. "
"Niles: Dad, here you are, one frozen pumpkin pie on request. "
"Daphne: Honestly, wouldn't you rather I just bake a pie from scratch? "
"Martin: Is it that you CAN’T learn or you WON’T learn? "
"Freddie: I'm done setting the table. "
"Niles: Oh, you did set the table... It looks very nice, very elegant, Frederick. "
"Daphne: Oh yes, Freddie's been quite the little helper. Every time I bend over to check the turkey, there he is. "
"Frasier: So, Lilith, tell me about this article you are writing. "
"Freddie: It's about me. "
"Lilith: Essentially, yes. I was talking to a friend that works at the New York Times Magazine about raising a child after divorce and she pointed out that as a psychiatrist, I might have a unique perspective. "
"Freddie: You know, since it's about me, shouldn't I get something for it? "
"Lilith: You're not getting a minibike. "
"Freddie: But Mom... "
"Lilith: We have talked about this. You can get one when you are fifteen. "
"Freddie: But all my friends have minibikes. "
"Lilith: Yes, and if all of your friends decided to enter a Level Four biohazard area without their environmental containment suits, would you do that too? "
"Freddie: This is different "
"Lilith: No, it's not. "
"Freddie: Dad "
"Frasier: Sorry Frederick, I'm with your mother on this one. "
"Daphne: Dinner's almost ready "
"Lilith: Excuse me. "
"Freddie: You know what I think, Dad? You and mom should write this article together. "
"Frasier: Well, I'm sure your mom can write it without my help. "
"Freddie: But it was her idea, she told me on the plane how much easier it would be. I just don't think she knows how to ask you. "
"Frasier: It is an intriguing idea. "
"Martin: Frasier I could use some help out here. "
"Daphne: He's picking the raisins out of the stuffing "
"Frasier: Oh Lord Coming, Dad. "
"Freddie: You know, I think you and Dad should write this article together. "
"Lilith: Together? Well, I think the last thing your father wants is to collaborate with me. "
"Freddie: But it was his idea. He just told me how much fun it would be. "
"Lilith: Well, it's an interesting notion. "
"Daphne: Beautiful job carving that turkey, Dr. Crane. "
"Niles: Well, I picked up a thing or two in medical school. In case you're wondering, this bird appears to have died of a massive head trauma. "
"Lilith: Did you wash your hands, Frederick? "
"Freddie: Yeah. Uncle Niles even showed me how to open the door with my elbow so I don't need to touch the handle. "
"Niles: What are uncles for? "
"Lilith: Daphne, is your fiancée joining us? "
"Daphne: No, I'll be seeing him later. Donny has his own Thanksgiving tradition. He has a dinner for all the divorced men he's represented during the year. He's hosting twenty-five today. "
"Lilith: Wow Twenty-five lonely, bitter men. "
"Daphne: It's been a good year. "
"Freddie: Uncle Niles, mom's writing an article about me. "
"Niles: Really? "
"Lilith: It's about raising a child after divorce. "
"Frasier: Yes, it sounds fascinating, doesn't it? It's a subject that's very near and dear to my own heart. "
"Lilith: Are you suggesting we collaborate? "
"Frasier: Well, if you think I might be helpful. "
"Freddie: What a great idea, you can write it together. "
"Frasier: I'd be willing. "
"Lilith: Well, we certainly did well on our first collaboration. "
"Frasier: You know, Lilith, we could probably get most of it done in the time you're still here in town. "
"Freddie: And if you stay here, you can finish the whole thing. "
"Frasier: Well, I guess it would be alright by me. "
"Lilith: Daphne, would that be too much of an imposition? "
"Daphne: Not at all, I'll be spending the weekend with Donny. Now, where is your father with that gravy? "
"Lilith: Then I'll stay here. Although maybe we should run this by your father. "
"Frasier: No need. "
"Lilith: Yes, but I think we should have something about non custodial parents and discipline. "
"Frasier: Exactly The weekend the father needn't be a weakened father. "
"Lilith: Frasier, you still have a direct line to my funny bone. "
"Frasier: Thank Goodness the line wasn't stop. "
"Lilith: Stop Now, if we laugh all night, we'll never get any work done. "
"TO: "
"Niles: Hey Frederick, I'm leaving. Whatcha doing? "
"Freddie: I'm saving the universe. Do you want to help? "
"Niles: I wouldn't know where to begin. "
"Freddie: It's easy, I'll show you. "
"Niles: All right, what do you do? "
"Freddie: That's your guy, you've just escaped from an intergalactic maximum security prison pod. "
"Niles: Like they could hold me. "
"Freddie: Now once you leave this chamber, you can go left or right, and different things will happen to you. "
"Niles: What happened? "
"Freddie: Wow I never saw the guy trip and fall before. Try it again, you have two lives left. "
"Niles: Okay. I can't seem to get out of this room, is this some sort of advanced level? "
"Freddie: No, this is like the training area. I didn't even know you could die here "
"Niles: I have to get out of this room "
"Freddie: The reset button's on the right. Do you want something to drink? "
"Niles: Quiet "
"TO: "
"Freddie: Hi, Dad. "
"Frasier: Oh, hi son. "
"Freddie: How's the writing? "
"Frasier: Well, it's coming along nicely, thanks. "
"Freddie: Oh, mom wants to know if you're bringing over the wine? "
"Frasier: Oh, of course, yes. "
"Freddie: You know, it's great to see you and Mom working together. I think she kinda misses you. "
"Frasier: Really? "
"Freddie: Yes, she talks about you all the time. Y ou know, how wonderful you are and how she's never met another man like you. You go take that out to her, I'll finish up in here. "
"Frasier: Thank you, son. "
"Frasier: There you are. "
"Lilith: Oh, thank you. I've been rearranging this outline, why don't you take a look. "
"Frasier: Looks fine. "
"Lilith: Frasier, you can't see it from there, sit down. You know, I'm really enjoying this collaboration. "
"Frasier: Me too. "
"Lilith: Is it me, or is it getting warm? [takes her jacket off revealing her bare shoulders] "
"Frasier: It is a little warm "
"Martin: All right, boy, I'm coming, I'm coming. "
"Frasier: Dad, let me walk you out. There's something I want to discuss with you. "
"Martin: You know, I've never seen him so eager to take a walk, I wonder what... Oh, right. "
"Freddie: Hey, mom. How's the article going? "
"Lilith: Very well, thank you. "
"Freddie: You know, I've never seen Dad this happy. "
"Lilith: Oh, what do you mean? "
"Freddie: Well, all he does is talk about you. How pretty you look and how smart you are and how much he misses you. "
"to: Hallway "
"Martin: What makes you think she's coming on to you? "
"Frasier: Well, actually Frederick told me, but you know, it actually makes sense. I mean, this colleague of hers gets mysteriously ill and then she lassoes me into writing this article with her and then all of a sudden before I know it, the bun is off and she's waggling her bare shoulder at me. "
"Martin: Hey, some of us just had a big meal "
"TO: "
"Niles: It's not your turn yet, I still have two more lives. "
"Lilith: It's Lilith. "
"Lilith: I need to talk to you. "
"Niles: Does the door have to be closed? "
"Lilith: I thinks it's best, it's of a personal nature. "
"Niles: What's this about? "
"Lilith: Well, it's about an attraction that I thought was over and now I'm beginning to think, maybe it's not. "
"Niles: Usually in my dreams, this is where I try to run and can't. "
"Lilith: This isn't about you, you egomaniac. This is about Frasier. I think he wants us together again. "
"Niles: He knows how I feel about you. "
"Lilith: Not us Me and Frasier Is there a chair here I could talk to? "
"Niles: Well, what makes you think he wants you to get back together? "
"Lilith: Well, first he offers to collaborate on this article, now he's plying me with wine and at this very moment I expect he's asking your father to clear out for the night. "
"Niles: So he took a professional interest in your article and he offered you some wine on Thanksgiving. Now who's the egomaniac? "
"Lilith: Perhaps I am overreacting. I'll just have to keep my eyes peeled for more conclusive evidence. "
"Niles: I didn't know there was a door there "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Then again, maybe I've just made this whole thing up in my head. Tell you what, Dad. Take a minute and then come back in. See what you think's going on in there and then find some subtle way to tell me what you think. "
"Martin: All right, okay. Just give me a minute. "
"Lilith: Frasier. "
"Frasier: Lilith. "
"Lilith: Well, isn't this nice? "
"Frasier: Yes, very nice. "
"Martin: Oh, excuse me again, I just came back to get an umbrella in case it rains. But I hope it doesn't, because Eddie's just dying to play this new game I taught him. I take off his leash and I say, 'Run for your life' That's exactly what I say, 'Run for your life' "
"Frasier: Thank you, Dad. "
"Martin: Okay. Run for your life "
"Lilith: Frasier, we have to talk. "
"Frasier: Yes, Lilith, we do. "
"Lilith: I mean, I can't just sit here all night waiting for you to make your move. "
"Frasier: Well, you've just got this all worked out, haven't you "
"Lilith: Well, let's see. Candlelight, wine, soft music. What else do I need? "
"Frasier: I don't know what's "
"worse: that you want me back or that you think I can be won so easily "
"Lilith: You think I'm responsible for this? "
"Frasier: You assume you can just snap your fingers and old Frasier'll come-a-runnin'? Well, I'm sorry, it doesn't work that way, sister. First of all I have to be finessed "
"Lilith: I didn't do any of this, and if you didn't either, then someone is setting us up. "
"Frasier: But who...? Frederick He told me that you've been pining for me. "
"Lilith: He just told me the same about you. "
"Frasier: Good Lord, here we are writing an article on taking your child through a divorce and our son is nursing the hopeless fantasy that we'll get back together. We've got to go talk with him. "
"Lilith: No, wait a minute, something is not right here. When has Frederick expressed the slightest desire to see us together? "
"Frasier: He could have been sublimating it for years. "
"Lilith: Even so, he lied to both of us. He had to have known that we'd compare notes. "
"Frasier: Alright, so his plan was a little artless. "
"Lilith: Unless... That's exactly what he wanted. "
"Frasier: What do you mean? "
"Lilith: Think about it. He makes us believe that he wants us together, of course we have to tell him that that's not going to happen. His hopes are dashed and we feel so guilty that we compensate by getting him something he wants. "
"Frasier: A minibike? "
"Lilith: That's a very clever little boy we have. "
"Frasier: Could he actually be so devious? "
"Lilith: Ah, well, if he wants something badly enough, he will figure out a way to get it. Remember when he was a baby, the bottle at the end of the maze? "
"Frasier: You know, I kinda regret doing that. "
"Lilith: Frederick "
"Frasier: What are you going to do? Just come out and ask him? "
"Lilith: Of course not, he'll only deny it. "
"Frasier: What then? "
"Lilith: Just go with me on this one. "
"Lilith: Frederick, have a seat, we need to talk to you. "
"Freddie: What about? "
"Lilith: We know that you've been trying to maneuver us together and it's only natural for a child of divorce to want that. Generally speaking, your plan would be fruitless, but when your father and I let down our guard and looked at each other in the candlelight, we realized that we belong together. In other words, we're getting remarried. "
"Freddie: Do you really mean it? This is going to be the best Christmas ever I'm gonna go tell Uncle Niles. "
"Frasier: Have you lost your mind? "
"Lilith: He's cooler than I thought. "
"Frasier: Cooler? This isn't a game of poker This is our son being lied to by his parents. We've got to go in there, tell him the truth and make it up to him. Even if it takes a fleet of minibikes "
"Lilith: No, no, Frasier. Please, we called his bluff. Now, he's calling ours. The question is, what's our next move? "
"Frasier: Oh, I know, why don't we just consult this handy little guide for divorced parents? "
"Lilith: We can't blink first, we've got to up the ante. "
"Frasier: Good idea, Lilith You know what? Let's go in there and promise him the baby brother he'll never have "
"Niles: What's this joyous news I hear? "
"Lilith: You know, Frederick, you're going to have to give up all of your friends, because we're going to live here in Seattle. "
"Freddie: I'd live anywhere to be a family again. "
"Niles: So it is true, congratulations to you both, good night. "
"Freddie: Don't you want your coat, Uncle Niles? "
"Niles: No, thank you "
"Freddie: I'm going to go call my friends. I love you. "
"Lilith: I don't understand, I was so sure. "
"Frasier: Oh gee, don't be so tough on yourself, Lilith. After all, what parent doesn't at one time or another completely obliterate their child's chances of ever trusting another human being? Oh well, there he is. Telling his friends that all of his dreams have come true. "
"Lilith: Unless that's what he wants us to think? "
"Frasier: When will you stop? "
"Freddie: It worked All I did was tap into my parents' feelings of inadequacy and they crumbled. "
"Boy: What does that mean? "
"Freddie: I'm getting the minibike. "
"Lilith: Frederick. "
"Freddie: Uh-oh "
"Lilith: Do I know my son, or do I know my son? "
"Frasier: He was willing to put us through absolute hell just for a minibike? "
"Lilith: You know what this means, don't you? "
"Frasier: Yes... he's normal. We're not bad parents. Well done, Dr. Sternin. "
"Lilith: Well done, Dr. Crane. "
"Lilith: Well, we really should get in there. "
"Frasier: Yes, I suppose we should. Must be sheer torment for him, waiting for the axe to fall. "
"Lilith: Absolute hell. "
"Frasier: Absolute nightmare. "
"then: "
"Frasier: Wine? "
"Lilith: Love some. "

"Martin: Rrrr'appy Rrrr'irthday, Rrrr'aiser "
"Frasier: Eddie You can talk "
"Martin: I've always been able to talk. I just save it for special occasions like somebody's rrr'irthday. "
"Frasier: Yes, Eddie, thank you very much. But listen, I'd like to talk about Dad. I think his mind may be slipping. "
"Martin: Hey, don't say things like that. He's a dog, he might not know you're joking. "
"Frasier: Why, Dad, I didn't even know you were here "
"Martin: Well, just give me a couple more minutes and I'll have your birthday breakfast all ready. Come on, Eddie "
"Martin: Rrright behind you "
"TO: Living Room "
"Frasier: Oh, well, that's very nice, Dad. "
"Martin: Oh, and look what I got. A newspaper from the day you were born. "
"Frasier: I keep telling you to clean out that closet of yours [sits down and reads it] "
"Martin: I ordered it "
"Frasier: Yes well, let's just see what other wonders occurred on that day. 'SUSPECTED PINKO OUTED FROM CROSSING GUARD POST” What a jolly world I was born into. "
"Martin: I know tonight's your party, but here. [lights a candle on a cupcake] Happy birthday Make a wish. "
"Frasier: Oh Dad, thank you. "
"Martin: What's the matter? "
"Frasier: My back It's completely seized up "
"Martin: Well, here... "
"Frasier: My God It's been a little tender lately. I went to see the doctor last week, he told me there was absolutely nothing wrong with it. "
"Martin: Oh, doctors never tell you anything, they're all just a bunch of overpaid quacks. Oh, I'm sorry, I don't mean you. I'm talking about real doctors "
"Frasier: How can this be happening to me? I'm always so conscientious about back safety. Why, just the other day when I needed that large heavy stack of books from down in the storage room, I insisted that Daphne make three trips. "
"Martin: Well, you know what, I've got that old girdle in my bedroom. Let me go get it. "
"Frasier: Dad, wait, I'm not going to wear anything called a girdle. "
"Martin: What if I call it a back-brace? "
"Frasier: Get it "
"Frasier: Daphne "
"Frasier: Oh, God... Coming This wouldn't be taking me so long if my housekeeper were here. "
"Daphne: I'm a physical therapist "
"Frasier: Then perhaps you could get me into a chair "
"Daphne: Oh goodness, is your back bothering you again? Oh, I'm sorry I made you get up. I forgot my keys. "
"Frasier: You know, perhaps you should get a spare set made just to keep at Donny's. For God's sake, you're practically living there as it is. "
"Daphne: Oh, now, Dr. Crane. You better get used to it. Once I'm married, I will be living there. I know what'll help that back, a nice massage. "
"Martin: Here we go. "
"Daphne: Oh, the girdle That'll help. "
"Martin: Now, it's kinda hard to put on by yourself. But if Daphne holds one end and I hold the other, you can kinda spin into it. "
"Frasier: Please Dad, this is humiliating enough as it is. "
"Martin: What's humiliating about it? Look, you just hook it in the back like a bra. "
"Frasier: Just give me that "
"Daphne: Mr. Crane, does it bother you when I stay over at Donny's? "
"Martin: No. "
"Daphne: Well, it seems to bother Dr. Crane. "
"Martin: Oh, he's just cranky because of his back. "
"Daphne: Good Lord Queen Elizabeth had another baby I don't care what science can do, it's just not right. "
"Frasier: Oh, that'll be fine right there, be sure to thank the gang for the flowers, Connie. "
"Connie: You're welcome, Dr. Crane. Happy Birthday. "
"Roz: Happy birthday, Frasier. "
"Frasier: Thank you, Roz. Not off to the best start though, my back is out. "
"Roz: Why don't you go home? We'll just air 'The Best of Crane.' I'll drop your gift by later. "
"Frasier: No, no, Roz. I promised my listeners that I'd read a birthday address. "
"Roz: Well, people might have forgotten, people do have busy lives, you know. [notices a book on the side] "
"Frasier: No, Roz, I announced it twice. Anyone paying the slightest attention would know. "
"Frasier: What are you doing over there? "
"Roz: Just, wondering when to surprise you with your... present "
"Frasier: Oh, Roz. "
"Roz: Yes, now is as good a time as any. "
"Frasier: You know, we keep promising each other that we're not going to do this. We've got to stop spoiling one another. "
"Roz: Well, what am I supposed to do? Just forget your birthday? "
"Frasier: Oh, Good Lord, Roz. You know, I read the most wonderful review of this recently. "
"Roz: I hope you like it. "
"Frasier: Oh look, you've inscribed it. "
"Roz: I did? "
"Frasier: 'You'll always be my baby.' "
"Roz: I must have had a glass of wine when I wrote that. "
"Frasier: 'Love, Mom.' "
"Niles: There's our bent and broken birthday boy. "
"Frasier: Hello, Niles. "
"Niles: I've brought you a little gift. Say hello to sweet salvation, the 'Lumbar Log.' "
"Frasier: Thank you, Niles. I think the whole thing is probably stress-related. "
"Niles: Well, that's very possible. Birthdays can be anxiety- provoking, especially for people of a certain age. "
"Frasier: I am not 'of a certain age,' Niles. I am smack dab in the middle of 'not a kid anymore.' I won't be 'of a certain age' for another ten years. "
"Roz: You know, if your back pain is stress-related, I read a magazine article with an exercise that might help. You just go someplace where nobody can hear you and list all the things that bug you. "
"Frasier: In what esteemed medical journal did you find this little tidbit - 'Cosmo'? "
"Roz: No, 'Glamour' "
"Frasier: Oh, that's priceless. 'I can't find the right shade of lipstick,' 'I look terrible in a bikini,' 'He can't find my G-spot.' "
"Roz: I said do it someplace private "
"Niles: You know, it couldn't hurt, Frasier. "
"Frasier: Oh, Niles, it's absurd. "
"Niles: Hmm, the more you resist, the more I'm wondering if there's something you're trying to avoid. "
"Roz: Well, thanks for backing me up, Niles. You know, the same article said if you rub a raw potato... "
"Niles: If we're going to sell him on this, you should drop out now. "
"Roz: OK. "
"Frasier: Nobody's going to sell me on anything. That sort of exercise only helps people who lack self awareness. I for one am... God almighty "
"Niles: Well, no wonder you're stressed, you've got a whole universe to run. "
"Roz: Thirty seconds, Frasier. "
"Niles: All right, I'll be off. You take care of yourself, I'll see you tonight. "
"Roz: Are you sure you're up to this? "
"Frasier: Oh, I'll be fine, Roz. I'm not as delicate as all that. "
"Roz: How did you do it anyway? "
"Frasier: Blowing out a cupcake. "
"Roz: You know, Frasier, we can always put on 'The Best of Crane.' "
"Frasier: No, no, Roz. Now, just have a little bit of faith in me. I'm a lot tougher than that. Tell you what, if I feel like I need help towards the end of the show, I'll give you a little signal, all right? "
"Roz: All right, five seconds. "
"Frasier: Gosh you know, these flowers really are beautiful. Good afternoon, Seattle. "
"TO: "
"Niles: Hello Anyone here? "
"Frasier: I guess they're all out. "
"Niles: Okay, well let's just get you settled "
"Frasier: Niles, Niles, slow down. For God's sake, we're not running a three-legged race. Do you have somewhere to be? "
"Niles: Well, since you bring it up, I do have a luncheon with my new lady love. "
"Frasier: Oh, well, gosh, I'd hate to have my pain stand in the way of that How could that orthopedist of yours tell me there was nothing wrong? "
"Niles: Frasier, I looked at the x-rays myself, this is not a skeletal problem. There, now you're all fine and I'm sure Dad will be by soon. "
"Frasier: No, wait. This couch has absolutely no support. [points to chair with ottoman] Let's try that chair over there, please. "
"Niles: All right. You're not heavy, you're my brother. "
"Frasier: How could you take me to that unprofessional hack? All he did was give me a bottle full of horse tranquilizers. He didn't care about getting to the root of the problem, he just wanted to shut me up "
"Niles: I think it might be time for one of those pills "
"Niles: All comfy? "
"Frasier: This won't do, it's even harder than a seat on a public bus. "
"Niles: Oh, when were you ever on a bus? "
"Frasier: At a cocktail party once for the 'Friends of Transit.' "
"Niles: I wasn't invited to that. "
"Frasier: Will you just help me up, for God's sake Oh God, you know, maybe I should take another one of those pills. "
"Niles: All right, I'll get you a glass of water, okay? "
"Frasier: Right. "
"Niles: You know, things are really going well with Mel. I've been out with her almost every night. I don't want to jinx things but I dare say we're well on our way to becoming what might almost pass as an item. "
"Niles: I mean it, Frasier, she is just the... Oh my God, did you fall? "
"Frasier: No, I’m actually quite comfortable, Niles. And look, there's no glare on the television... and here's a lovely place to set your drink. "
"Niles: Just give me your hand and whatever the chair's telling you, don't listen. "
"Frasier: No, it's helping my back actually. You know, and when you sit in it, you don't have to look at it. "
"Niles: If you're really interested in correcting this problem and not just medicating it, you should consider that technique Roz mentioned - you know, listing your problems aloud. "
"Frasier: Oh, give me a break. "
"Niles: It's perfectly possible that this is connected to some submerged anxiety. What's bothering you? "
"Frasier: Oh, yes, Niles, you really expect me to sit here all alone in some apartment, prattling on endlessly about my problems like some sort of a lunatic. [Niles slowly leaves unnoticed by Frasier] If you think I'm going to do that, you're the one who needs to get his head examined... "
"Frasier: Oh, good God Oh, Eddie, please just shoo Get off me, get off me "
"Frasier: What? Do you want to know what's bothering me too? Well, here's a start, I'm talking to a dog, that bothers me... I'm another year older today. I suppose that bothers me, but not as much as people seem to think. I'm still single, that's a big one. Not having a woman to share my life with. The only women in my life are friends; Roz and Daphne. Daphne's not even here anymore, she'll be married soon. That's going to be tough on Dad. "
"Frasier: Who am I kidding? It's going to be tough on me. It's been nice having her here. Even when my love life hasn't been going so well, I can always come home to a warm and considerate woman. You know, that's probably why I've been so brusque with her lately. I know that once she's gone, I'll probably be twice as lonely. Well, it's quite a realization, isn't it? "
"Frasier: I really do love Daphne and I'm about to lose her. I've got to show her how I feel about her, while I still have the chance. "
"Frasier: Well, I don't know whether it was the therapy or the painkillers but I actually feel a bit better. Let's try this. Ah... "
"Frasier: You know, there are subtler ways to let the patient know his hour is up. "
"Daphne: Oh, Dr. Crane I didn't know you were here, I can't hear anything in that shower of mine, it's like a soundproof vault "
"Frasier: Daphne, I wanted to apologize for being so short with you this morning. "
"Daphne: It's fine. "
"Frasier: No, it's not. It's never fine. Listen, come here, please. "
"Frasier: Give me a hug. "
"Frasier: Oh Daphne, do you know how much you mean to me? "
"Daphne: I'm getting an idea "
"Martin: What's wrong? Are you all right? "
"Daphne: Well, actually no. I overheard something I wasn't supposed to hear. It's about Dr. Crane. I overheard him say he's in love with me. "
"Martin: What? "
"Daphne: And he wants to show me how much he loves me while he still has the chance. "
"Martin: Oh, jeez, not this "
"Daphne: You knew about this? "
"Martin: I'm not getting in the middle of this "
"Daphne: Then it's true? "
"Martin: Look, I kept my mouth shut for six years, I'm not saying anything now. "
"Daphne: Six years? He's felt this way for six years? "
"Martin: You didn't hear that from me "
"Frasier: Daphne. Daphne, I can't lower myself into the tub. "
"Daphne: Well, don't look at me "
"Frasier: No, I thought I'd skip the bath and take you up on that massage you offered. Those expert hands of yours might be just what the doctor ordered. Let's do it in my bedroom, shall we? "
"TO: Frasier's Bedroom. "
"Frasier: What kept you? Daphne, here, just help me out of this robe, please. I nearly killed myself putting it on. "
"Daphne: Here we go Now, remember, your back's very tender, so no sudden movements. "
"Daphne: You know, I'm catching a draft in this robe, perhaps I better change. "
"Frasier: I'll be waiting "
"Daphne: Ooh "
"Martin: Hey, Fras. "
"Frasier: Yes, Dad. "
"Martin: Did Daphne tell you? "
"Frasier: Tell me what? "
"Martin: She found out Niles has a thing for her. "
"Frasier: What? "
"Martin: Yes. "
"Frasier: How? "
"Martin: Well, she said she overheard him earlier saying how much he loves her. "
"Frasier: Oh, dear God, no wonder she's been so distracted. What did you say, did you confirm it? "
"Martin: Well, yes, I said I knew about it. "
"Frasier: Oh, Dad... "
"Martin: Well come on, what else was I going to say? And then I told her it was none of my business and I took off out of there. "
"Frasier: Wait a minute How did she even see Niles today? "
"Martin: I don't know, but she said she overheard him saying he loves her and that he wanted to tell her while he still has the chance. "
"Frasier: Oh, no "
"Martin: What? "
"Frasier: I said that. "
"Martin: Oh, not you now "
"Frasier: No, no, no, Dad, not that. I was just doing a little exercise to try and help my back and I was talking out loud about how much I was going to miss Daphne. She must have overheard me and misunderstood. "
"Martin: Who were you talking to? "
"Frasier: If you must know, I was talking to Eddie. "
"Martin: Helps, doesn't it "
"Frasier: Oh, stop it. Thanks to you, now Daphne thinks I'm in love with her. Here I am asking her for a massage, how is she expected to interpret that? "
"Martin: "
"Frasier: Oh, Lord. "
"Daphne: Just take a deep breath and try to relax. "
"Frasier: Daphne... "
"Daphne: Let's both do that, shall we? "
"Frasier: Daphne, Dad told me that you overheard me. "
"Daphne: He did? "
"Frasier: Yes. "
"Daphne: Well, I certainly picked the wrong person to confide in. "
"Frasier: No, no, no, I'm glad he told me, because the truth is you misunderstood. You see, when I said how much I cared about you, I didn't mean it in a romantic sense. "
"Daphne: Then you don't love me? "
"Frasier: Oh, no, of course I love you, Daphne, but as a friend, that's all "
"Daphne: Oh thank God What a relief I mean I was flattered, but... "
"Frasier: That's fine, off you go... Oh my, my head. "
"Daphne: It must be those pills. Come on, let me give you that massage while you can still feel it. "
"Frasier: All right. "
"Frasier: You know, Daph, we really are going to miss you around here. "
"Daphne: It's going to be hard for me too. Something I haven't even wanted to think about - leaving. I know I grumble a bit, but I do love you and your father. I'll still come around though, we'll still see each other. "
"Frasier: You know what? "
"Daphne: What's that, Dr. Crane? "
"Frasier: Dad's chair. "
"Daphne: I'm not taking it with me if that's where you're heading. "
"Frasier: It's so comfortable "
"Daphne: You took quite a few of those pills, didn't you? You know what's curious, though? "
"Frasier: Cats "
"Daphne: Yes But I'm talking about our little mix-up. When I said to your father, 'Dr. Crane's in love with me,' he said it's been going on for six years now. What did he mean by that? "
"Frasier: Oh that... he meant Niles "
"Daphne: What? "
"Frasier: Niles... he's crazy about you "
"Daphne: Dr. Crane "
"TO: "
"Martin: Come on, Rrr'irthday Boy. Wakey, Wakey, time for Cakey "
"Frasier: Dear God Has a year passed already? "
"TO: Living Room "
"Daphne: Please, the elastic's pinching behind my ears "
"Martin: Oh, come on, it's just for a couple of hours. "
"Daphne: It's pulling my hair "
"Martin: You don't hear Eddie complaining, do you? I rr'uv my hat "
"Daphne: You know, I'm this close to breaking that thing into a million pieces "
"Frasier: Well, isn't this festive Oh, Daphne, by the way, thank you for the massage, I think it did just the trick. "
"Daphne: Anytime, Dr. Crane. "
"Frasier: Listen, just before I drifted off I'm afraid I might have said something I wish I hadn't. "
"Daphne: Yes? "
"Frasier: It's about Dad's chair, it may be comfortable but I still want to get it out of here. "
"Daphne: Oh, that. "
"Frasier: Why, I didn't say anything else I shouldn't have said, did I? "
"Daphne: Well... Mum's the word "
"Daphne: I'll get it "
"Frasier: Why, thank you. "
"Martin: Did you straighten things out with Daphne? "
"Frasier: Yes, I did. "
"Martin: Boy, that was a close one. I almost blew Niles's secret "
"Frasier: Would you try to be more discreet I can't pull your chestnuts out of the fire every time "
"Niles: Good evening, Daphne. "
"Daphne: Dr. Crane. "
"Niles: You look different somehow. Have you done something new with your hair? "
"Niles: That must be it "

" "
"Frasier: Oh, Good Lord, Dad. You've been tinkering with that thing for hours. Don't you think that maybe 'Dancing Santa' could sit this Christmas out? "
"Martin: Oh, I've got to get it ready for your big party tomorrow night. "
"Frasier: Oh, no need, Dad. There will be plenty of things to delight my guests. We'll be caroling and playing games. Oh, and I'll be reading 'A Child's Christmas in Wales' to bring the evening to a close. "
"Martin: That should do it "
"Roz: Hey, Frasier. "
"Frasier: Oh, hello, Roz. "
"Roz: Hey, Martin. "
"Martin: Hello, Roz. "
"Roz: I can't stay, I just stopped by to drop off your punch bowl. "
"Frasier: Well, thank you, Roz. Say, what kind of punch did you serve? "
"Roz: Well, first I filled it with ice. Then I just poured orange juice and vodka over it. "
"Frasier: Well, Roz, that's just a giant screwdriver "
"Roz: Yeah, so? What am I, Martha Stewart? "
"Frasier: Fine Thanks anyway, I'm really going to be needing this bowl tomorrow evening. There's going to be a crowd of guests. I've invited the entire building - including Cam Winston. "
"Martin: Oh "
"Frasier: In the spirit of Christmas I've decided to put an end to our feud. "
"Roz: What are you feuding about? "
"Martin: Oh, he parks his SUV right next to Frasier's Beemer "
"Frasier: Yes well, that car is grotesquely oversized. I've often been forced to exit from the passenger's side. Many a time, I've been brought to grief on my gear shift "
"Roz: Why doesn't he just back in? "
"Martin: Are you kidding? He can barely hit that space even when the guy's car isn't there "
"Daphne: Hi, Roz. "
"Roz: Hey, Daphne. "
"Daphne: You leaving? "
"Roz: Yeah. "
"Daphne: Actually, there's something I'd like to talk to you about. "
"Roz: What is it? "
"Daphne: The other day I found out something about Dr. Crane I wasn't supposed to know. "
"Roz: Frasier? "
"Daphne: No, his brother. Apparently, he's had a crush on me for years. "
"Roz: Thank God "
"Daphne: What do you mean, 'Thank God?' "
"Roz: I've been afraid for months I'd be the one to blow the secret. "
"Daphne: You mean you knew? "
"Roz: Well, everybody kinda did. "
"Daphne: And nobody said anything? "
"Roz: Well, if Niles wasn't ready to say anything, it wasn't our place to do it. Well, who spilt the beans? It was Frasier, wasn't it? "
"Daphne: Yeah, but he doesn't know he told me. "
"Roz: He doesn't? "
"Daphne: Well, he was on those painkillers for his back and, well, I can't very well discuss it with Dr. Crane, he's so close to Dr. Crane, if I told him he might tell Dr. Crane and then Dr. Crane might feel embarrassed. "
"Roz: Yeah, why confuse things? "
"Daphne: The whole thing's just a bit awkward. "
"Roz: I don't see why. Niles has a girlfriend now, so obviously he's gotten over you, and you're engaged to Donny. "
"Daphne: I suppose when you look at it like that there's really no reason to feel awkward. "
"Niles: Well, there's a Christmas "
"tableau: 'Naughty & Nice.' "
"Daphne: Hello, Dr. Crane. "
"Niles: Hello, Daphne. "
"Daphne: I'd see you inside but... I just have to... Take out the garbage It's in my pocket. "
"Niles: Frasier, I brought those caroling books you asked for. "
"Frasier: Thank you so much. Yes, here we are. 'The First Songs From A Victorian Christmas' and 'Elizabethan Tidings of Joy.' Now we're ready to party Niles, what do you think? Should we start with the caroling or should we hold off until we've played a spirited game of 'The Minister's Cat?' "
"Niles: Start with the game, then the caroling, then perhaps the guests will be ready for another game. "
"Martin: Yeah, Russian Roulette "
"Niles: So, I'm off. "
"Frasier: Oh, Niles, if you're not busy this evening, perhaps you could help me string popcorn garlands. "
"Niles: Ah, unfortunately, I have to see Maris tonight. "
"Martin: Maris? What the hell do you have to see her for? "
"Niles: Sadly, to pay my condolences. It seems our old gardener has passed away unexpectedly. "
"Frasier: Oh, not Yoshi. Gosh, that's too bad. "
"Niles: He had a heart attack when he was out trimming Maris's elaborate hedge maze. The paramedics never had a chance. "
"Martin: Well, I feel bad about Yoshi, but are you sure it's a good idea spending the evening with Maris? "
"Niles: Well, she's terribly upset. Maris and Yoshi were very close. In fact I remember he once made a topiary likeness of her and wept without shame when it developed root rot. Well, the problem is, I had to cancel on Mel tonight. "
"Frasier: Oh, really? Well, Niles, if you want my advice, I wouldn't mention Maris to Mel. "
"Niles: What? "
"Frasier: The last thing a new girlfriend wants to hear is that you're consoling your ex-wife. "
"Niles: Well, I hate to lie to Mel. Though I do see your point, Frasier. "
"Martin: Ha-hey There he goes "
"Niles: Dad Santa's back "
"Martin: Yeah It's the darndest thing, every year when I take him out of the box, something's wrong with it. But I always manage to fix him again. "
"Niles: Good for you, Dad. I told you to dunk it underwater. "
"Frasier: I did "
"Kenny: Hey Doc. Merry Christmas. "
"Frasier: Hi, Kenny. My, the station has certainly outdone itself this year with the Christmas in Mexico theme. "
"Kenny: It was my idea. It hit me when I realized their sauces are red and green. "
"Frasier: Well, that's why you're the boss. "
"Roz: Hey, Frasier, what time's your party tonight? "
"Frasier: Please keep your voice down, you're the only one from the station I've invited. "
"Roz: The only one? "
"Frasier: Yes, but don't worry, there'll be scads of people, because I invited everyone in my building. Seven o’clock "
"Frasier: Oh, Gil, Merry Christmas. "
"Gil: And to you, Frasier. "
"Frasier: Oh, thank you. "
"Gil: I hope you've saved room for dessert. "
"Frasier: Have you been baking? "
"Gil: I have Gingerbread men. "
"Frasier: Oh my, don't they look... muscular "
"Gil: Yes well, my wife and I made a New Year's Resolution; Deb and I have joined a gym to slim down and buff up. We needed these to inspire us. "
"Frasier: Ah yes, there's nothing to strengthen a dieter's resolve like a good motivational pastry. "
"Gil: Precisely. The problem is they're so delicious, I've already had three. This is my last little man, I promise. Oh, Gil, who are you kidding? "
"Frasier: No one, Gil. "
"Mel: Frasier. "
"Frasier: Mel. "
"Mel: Hello. "
"Frasier: Well, gosh, I never expected to see you here. "
"Mel: Oh, well, I was one of the doctors on 'Health Chat' during cosmetic surgery week. I did a segment on breast augmentation. "
"Frasier: Ah, how uplifting "
"Mel: Yes well, Niles is hanging up our coats. So did you two have a good dinner last night? "
"Frasier: Oh, no, no, actually we didn't have dinner last night, I was too busy planning my party. But please don't mention it to any of my colleagues, they're not invited... "
"Frasier: Mel? "
"Niles: Frasier, Frasier, glad I saw you. About last night, if Mel should ask... "
"Frasier: Oh, dear. "
"Niles: Oh, no. "
"Frasier: Oh, yes. "
"Niles: And you...? "
"Frasier: I'm afraid so. "
"Niles: Damn you Well, you're the one who told me to lie to her and now you fail to back me up "
"Frasier: Well, I'm a little preoccupied, I'm having a party tonight for two hundred people "
"Kenny: Well, I won't lie to you, Doc. This hurts "
"Niles: Mel, Mel, darling, please, quick, quick come here, sweetheart. "
"Mel: Niles- "
"Niles: I know you're upset, darling, but... "
"Mel: Please, we're at a party. "
"Niles: All right, you're right, we'll talk about it later. "
"Mel: No, we'll talk about it now. Just put on your party face. "
"Mel: Don't embarrass me - as if I could be further embarrassed after you lied to me. "
"Niles: I can explain. "
"Mel: No, no, no, you don't need to. When a man lies about where he's been, it's not hard to guess the reason. So what's the little whore's name? "
"Niles: No, no, darling. The reason I told you that I was dining with Frasier was actually, I was out... "
"Mel: Yes? "
"Niles: Getting your Christmas present. "
"Mel: My present Oh, darling, I'm so sorry. I should have known. "
"Niles: I'm so glad you're forgiving me. Or is that your party face? "
"Mel: No, of course not. Why don't you hang my coat back up and I'll get us something to drink? "
"Niles: Of course. "
"Frasier: Oh, Mel, this is awkward. "
"Mel: Oh, no, no, no, Frasier. Niles explained everything and while I don't like being lied to, I do appreciate why he did it. "
"Niles: Ooh, hello Hello, chatting, are we? "
"Frasier: Well, actually I was just apologizing for my part in your little misunderstanding. "
"Niles: Well, then of course you were discussing the present. "
"Frasier: Oh, yes, the present. And the future, Maris is all in the past "
"Mel: Maris? "
"Frasier: Oh, dear. "
"Mel: You were with Maris last night? "
"Niles: Well... "
"Mel: How dare you? "
"Niles: Anything else in the box, Pandora? "
"Niles: Mel, please. "
"Mel: Don't touch me, no. "
"Niles: Party face, party face. "
"Mel: Forget the party face. You're obviously still in love with you and I'm not about to share you. Goodbye. "
"Frasier: Niles, Niles, I'm so sorry. "
"Niles: Frasier, don't pretend to be sorry. All you care about is your precious party that you're hosting tonight "
"Donny: Don't be nervous, honey. "
"Donny: Bring it home, Daphne "
"Donny: Daphne Moon, everybody We'll take your requests. "
"Martin: How about a little 'Silent Night'? "
"Frasier: Oh, stop that "
"Martin: What? "
"Frasier: Those are for the party. "
"Martin: In case you haven't "
"noticed: I am the party. "
"Donny: Didn't the invitation say it was for seven o’clock? "
"Daphne: I hope people knew it was for tonight. "
"Frasier: Stop worrying, they'll be here. They're probably just fashionably late. People do love to make an entrance, you know. "
"Frasier: A-ha Daphne, open the floodgates "
"Niles: Hello. "
"Daphne: Evening, Dr. Crane. Isn't Mel with you? "
"Niles: No, she won't be coming. We broke up. "
"Daphne: What? "
"Niles: Yup, this afternoon. "
"Daphne: Goodness, I'm so sorry. "
"Frasier: Did you try to call her, Niles? "
"Niles: I left a dozen messages. "
"Donny: Oh, no, I'm so sorry. How long were you guys together? "
"Niles: Oh, no that long. Still, I was optimistic. "
"Donny: Did you talk about moving in together? Make any long term plans? "
"Niles: This is really bringing out the lawyer in you, isn't it? "
"Donny: The bartender, actually. I was just wondering how big a drink to make you. "
"Niles: Ah, big Scotch. "
"Donny: Don't worry, Niles. We'll fix you up with somebody. "
"Niles: Oh, thanks Donny, I don't think this is a time for me to be meeting someone new. "
"Donny: Someone old, then. You know, an old flame, an ex-girlfriend, someone who got away. Huh? Come on Niles, there must be somebody you had your eye on before Mel. "
"Daphne: Donny, please Can't you see you're making him uncomfortable "
"Donny: What? I was just trying to help, honey You see, Niles, it's not us, it's the holidays. It makes women crazy "
"Frasier: A-ha, hello everyone Come in, come in "
"Frasier: That's very nice, ladies first. Now, no crowding, no pushing. "
"Frasier: Where are they going? "
"Roz: I've got bad news for you. That feud you were having with the guy upstairs? It isn't over. He's having his own party. "
"Frasier: Damn him He's siphoning off my guests. "
"Frasier: You know, you won't believe this. That dreadful Cam Winston is having a competing party "
"Donny: Oh, that's what that was. Some big sign in the lobby, it said 'Winston Party 2000.' "
"Frasier: Yes, that's his apartment number. Well, two can play at that game Donny "
"Donny: Yeah? "
"Frasier: Do me a favor, will you? Make me one of those signs, see what you can fashion out of these crude implements. "
"Donny: Okay, I'll try. "
"Martin: I don't know whether that's a good idea, Fras. "
"Frasier: What? "
"Martin: Well, 'Winston Party 2000' sounds like the party of the future. 'Crane Party 1901' sounds like... well, this. "
"Roz: Don't worry about it, Frasier. You always throw a good party. This place'll be hopping in no time. "
"Frasier: Thanks, Roz. "
"Roz: Hey, Connie, it's a morgue here. Is the party at the station still happening? Great, I'll be there as soon as I can. "
"Roz: Oh, hey Daphne. "
"Daphne: You're not going to believe this. Dr. Crane broke up with Mel. "
"Roz: Oh, yeah, I know, I heard. "
"Daphne: Is there anything you don't know before I do? "
"Roz: I overheard them at the office Christmas party. "
"Daphne: Really, what happened? "
"Roz: Well, okay, don't freak out. Mel accused Niles of still being in love with someone else. "
"Daphne: My God, that's me I'm someone. "
"Roz: I said not to freak out. "
"Daphne: But what if he says something to me? "
"Roz: Just let him down gently. "
"Daphne: Oh, it never works out that easily. You know how it is when you say no to a guy. "
"Roz: Yeah... sure. "
"Daphne: It just gets messy after that. You say you'll be friends, but you never are. It ruins everything. "
"Roz: He's not going to say anything tonight. As long as Donny's here you're totally safe. "
"Frasier: Let's find a prominent place to put this. Preferably right on top of Winston's sign "
"Frasier: Oh, go easy there, Niles. "
"Niles: Oh, haven't you given me enough advice for one day? "
"Frasier: My canapés "
"Martin: You know, Niles, you look like you need cheering up. "
"Niles: Daphne's present "
"Martin: Did it break? "
"Niles: Well, we won't know until she opens it "
"Martin: I'm sorry, but, hey look. You don't need this one for Mel, do you? "
"Niles: Well, I guess not. "
"Martin: Okay, well here. Put that in there, and this right in here, problem solved. "
"Frasier: All right, now, you two, I don't want everyone congregating in the kitchen. Now go out and mingle "
"Roz: Niles Martin I didn't see you come in "
"Niles: Roz Daphne I didn't want to give these out in front of all the guests, but since there aren't any. [hands over presents] Roz, this is for you, and Daphne, Merry Christmas. "
"Daphne: Oh, Merry Christmas, thank you, Dr. Crane. "
"Daphne: Oh no, it's jewelry. "
"Roz: Oh no, it's a book. "
"TO: "
"Frasier: My God, there must be a hundred people up there Well, I'll just show you what you're missing Savory lamb tenders Pesto-filled mushroom caps Smell ‘em and weep "
"Martin: Come on, Frasier. Maybe we ought to walk you back inside, there you are... "
"Frasier: Oh, Dad... "
"Niles: Yes, yes darling, that's wonderful. I'll see you soon. "
"Niles: That was Mel "
"Frasier: And? "
"Niles: I managed to explain about Yoshi, she's on her way over. "
"Frasier: Thank God "
"Niles: I know. "
"Frasier: Another guest Oh, it's also wonderful for you, Niles. Congratulations. "
"Niles: There is one minor detail I need to iron out. I also got a message from Maris saying she wants to see me again. [gets a bottle of water] I think she may have mistaken last night's sympathy for affection. "
"Frasier: Oh, my. Well, Niles, if you want my advice- "
"Niles: Ooh, you know, you really need to stop saying that. "
"Frasier: You've got to make your feelings clear to her, and the sooner the better. There's very little point letting it drag on like this. "
"Niles: You're right. I'll speak to her tonight. "
"Niles: At the moment, I just want to patch things up with Mel. "
"Frasier: A-ha. Well, you know, those antique earrings you bought her should go a long way towards that. "
"Niles: Oh... I gave them to Daphne "
"Frasier: You did what? "
"Niles: Well, Daphne's gift broke and I didn't think Mel was coming. Dad suggested I switch the gift cards. "
"Frasier: Oh, for God's sake. Dad and his meddling Well, if you want my advice... You know where to find me. "
"Daphne: Roz "
"Roz: What? "
"Daphne: You can't go. "
"Roz: Why not? "
"Niles: Daphne, I'm sorry to interrupt. I need to speak with you. It's a private matter, would you join me out on the balcony for a moment? "
"Daphne: All right. "
"Niles: Thank you. "
"Roz: Whoa He's gonna tell you. "
"Daphne: Oh no, not tonight, not while Donny's here Roz "
"Roz: Okay, so I was wrong. Boy, this is rough. What are you going to do? "
"Daphne: I don't know. I guess I won't give him the chance. I'll speak first, I'll just be direct. I'll tell him I know how he feels about me, but I don't feel that way about him. I love Donny, and nothing's going to happen between us. "
"Roz: Good. Luck "
"Daphne: Hi. "
"Niles: Daphne, er, I wish there were an easier way to say this, I... "
"Daphne: Wait I have something I'd like to say first. Dr. Crane, I have to tell you that... "
"Niles: Oh Daphne, I am so sorry, what am I thinking? Here. "
"Daphne: Oh, thank you. Anyway, Dr. Crane, I know that... [once again she can't say it] "
"Niles: Yes? "
"Daphne: I'm sorry, I... "
"Niles: Why don't I start? "
"Daphne: No, Dr. Crane... "
"Niles: No, no, I really need to say this, I can't wait any longer. Daphne... "
"Daphne: Yes? "
"Niles: This is so difficult for me. "
"Daphne: Yes. "
"Niles: I need my Christmas present back. "
"Daphne: ...You what? "
"Frasier: People will go almost anywhere for free food and booze. Am I really so insufferable? "
"Roz: I could call up the station and see if people want to come over. "
"Frasier: Oh yes, Roz, let's call in the second string guests. Let's fill my home with a bunch of angry, snubbed co-workers. Do you think they'd come? "
"Frasier: Fashionably late Hello, everyone. Come in, Merry Christmas. Help yourself to the drinks. "
"Donny: Okay, Marty, how did you get these people down here? "
"Martin: Oh, I just called an old buddy in the fire department and told him that that many people in one place had to be a code violation. "
"Donny: Oh, that is smart. But aren't there going to be the same number of people down here? "
"Frasier: All right, everyone, we'll start by singing some carols and then we will choose our teams for 'The Minister's Cat.' "
"Martin: I don't think that's going to be a problem. "
"Niles: I feel terrible about this, and of course, I'll replace the gift. "
"Daphne: That's all right. Well, I won't be needing this anymore. "
"Niles: Daphne, Daphne, Daphne, you never finished what you were going to say. "
"Daphne: Oh, well, it was about the gift. Well, I could see from the box that you got me jewelry from 'Beady & Sons' and I didn't get you anything nearly as grand. Well, doesn't matter now. "
"Daphne: Oh, Mel. She's here. "
"Niles: Yes, excuse me. "
"Niles: I'm so glad you came. Merry Christmas. "
"Mel: Merry Christmas. "
"Roz: So, how did it go? Did you tell him? "
"Daphne: Never got the chance, he went first. It turned out he'd just given me the wrong gift and wanted it back. "
"Roz: You're kidding You must be so relieved. "
"Daphne: I'll say I've never been so relieved in my life. "
"Frasier: All right, everyone, we'll start with an easy one. "
"Chorus: Deck the halls with bows of holly, Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, Tis' the season to be jolly, Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, Don we now our gay apparel, Fa-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la. "

"Roz: Hey, Frasier. "
"Frasier: Hello, Roz. Happy New Year. Or should I say 'Happy New Millennium?' "
"Roz: Oh, barf, I'm so sick of talking about it. "
"Frasier: Oh, now Roz, let's not condemn the new Millennium just because you woke up in it with a hangover. That's what ruined church for you. "
"Roz: I just hate how this arbitrary point on the calendar has become so significant. And as far as my hangover went, it was worth it. I partied my ass off like a brain-damaged test monkey "
"Frasier: I see. Well, allow me to congratulate you on your first science-related metaphor. "
"Roz: Thank you. And what did you do? Get all freaky and finish your list of the century's greatest thinkers? "
"Frasier: No, my New Year's was plenty exciting enough, thank you very much Although not exactly in the way I'd planned... "
"TO: "
"Niles: Cancel the Millennium 'Chez Henri' has burned down "
"Frasier: Burned down? "
"Niles: Yes Apparently, Henri was caramelizing a huge crème brûlèe in the shape of Puget Sound, when a sugar spark ignited a thirty-foot paper maché 'Space Needle.' They're already calling it the worst centerpiece disaster in the history of Seattle. "
"Frasier: Henri built his reputation with that caramelizing torch. My God, the irony of him burning down his own restaurant with it. It's worthy of 'Oh Henry.' "
"Niles: 'Oh Henri.' "
"Frasier: Please, Niles, it's too soon to joke. What exactly are we going to do tomorrow night? Every restaurant in town worth going to has been booked for months. "
"Martin: Well, you know, you can join me and the boys at McGinty's. It's going to be a lot of fun, they're going to dye the beer green. "
"Niles: Why would you do that on New Year's Eve? "
"Martin: Oh well, McGinty's going in for a bypass next month and he's afraid he might not make it out for St. Paddy's Day. "
"Niles: This is a disaster "
"Martin: No, they'll just pop in another pig valve. You know, the only reason he needs it is because he eats so much bacon. So, the same thing that's killing him is keeping him alive. There's your 'Oh Henry' story. "
"Niles: Well, maybe we can just stay in tomorrow night. "
"Frasier: On the most significant New Year's Eve of our lifetime? I think not "
"Niles: I should have just gone with Mel. She and her mother are taking a hot air balloon through the wine country. [Martin and Frasier look at him] Well, not in the balloon, no, but I could have followed along in the recovery vehicle. "
"Frasier: Wait a minute Speaking of wine, wasn't the wine club having some sort of a party? "
"Niles: Yes, at Ken Lauerbock's place in Sun Valley. Oh, it's a huge event. "
"Frasier: Of course, 'Auld Lang Wine' Niles, call to see if we're still invited. "
"Niles: All right, I'm on it. "
"Daphne: Bloody hell Five days after Christmas is over and I'm still getting these cards They do it on purpose, you know. It's always from someone you forgot, and then it's too late to send one back, then they sneer at you for the rest of the year 'Peace and Goodwill,' my ass You just lost yourself a customer, Dr. Naran S. Gupta, D.D.S. "
"Martin: Losing a set of English teeth, he'll feel that "
"Daphne: This is for you, from the DMV. "
"Martin: Oh-ho, I know what this is The custom plates I ordered for my Winnebago Yay Well, fifty bucks, but I think it says it all. "
"Frasier: 'Erd... Whirr-Er'? "
"Daphne: 'Rid-Worr-Yer'? "
"Frasier: 'Red Wearer' "
"Martin: Oh, for God's sake 'Road Warrior' "
"Daphne: Of course For a retired man with a cane and a Winnebago, I don't know why my mind didn't go straight to it "
"Niles: Huzzah Ken said he'd love to have us come and the more the merrier. "
"Frasier: Oh, Niles, that's brilliant. Dad, please, please, won't you join us? You know what, say, let's call the travel agent. "
"Daphne: Not to rain on your parade, but you may have a tough time getting flights this late. Donny and I had a devil of a time getting our flights to San Francisco. "
"Frasier: Oh Daphne, they always set aside a few choice seats for Seattle's travel elite. "
"TO: "
"Motorist: Pick a lane, Road Warrior "
"Martin: See, he got it He-hee [Martin puts his thumb up at him in glee] "
"Martin: Being on the road like this, it's like we're three dusty hobos sharing a box-car to parts unknown. "
"Niles: Yes, well, if you don't take this next turn we'll end up in 'Californy.' "
"Frasier: Gee, Niles, you seem a little cranky. "
"Niles: Well, perhaps that's because I was rousted out of a warm bed at the crack of dawn and herded onto a Winnebago "
"Martin: Better safe than sorry, Niles. You know, it's 650 miles to Sun Valley, and half of that's through the mountains. "
"Niles: By the way, how are we going to explain to the wine club our arriving in a Winnebago? "
"Frasier: Just chalk it off to whimsy, Niles. We'll call it our 'Van Ordinaire' You know, besides, I'm actually enjoying this little trip through the heartland. I feel a bit out of touch with the common man, it's nice to reconnect. "
"Niles: Well, while you're reconnecting, why don't you let me drive? "
"Frasier: I would, Niles. It's just that, em... I need you to navigate. "
"Martin: Yeah, you're the most important member of our crew, good buddy "
"Frasier: The man with the map "
"Niles: Stop patronizing me, I want to drive. "
"Martin: Oh, you're not good with big cars, Niles. Remember when I tried to teach you to drive my LeSabre? You kept panicking and pulling on the emergency brake. "
"Niles: Well, it's a good thing I did. Those mailboxes weren't even slowing me down "
"Martin: Oh, did you see that sign? 'Little Red Cabin.' Do you remember those diners? 'Home of the Log "
"Roller: a flank steak wrapped around a combination of eggs, cheese and onions' You kids used to love eating there. You'd scream out at me, 'Dad, pull over. Quick, pull over' "
"Frasier: Actually, Dad, that was after we ate "
"TO: "
"Frasier: I thought you were sleeping. "
"Niles: I was trying to, but Dad wanted to watch the VCR. "
"Frasier: Oh, good Lord, not 'Robin and the Seven Hoods' again. "
"Niles: Worse. "
"Martin: Yeah, baby, you know, that was a shag-a-delic flick "
"Niles: You know, dad, if you're quite done, I think I'll try to take a nap. "
"Martin: Oh, beeehave "
"Frasier: You know, Dad, you do realize that the 'Austin Powers' craze is completely over "
"Martin: Well, I'm sorry, do I bore you? Or do I make you randy? "
"Frasier: Hello. Yes, Niles. I'm driving as smoothly as I can. Any other little driving tips you'd like to give me, why don't you just come up here and tell me to my face "
"Martin: Hey, look, another 'Little Red Cabin' sign. You know, we're not going to find anything better to eat on this highway. "
"Frasier: Oh, let's not be hasty, Dad. It's five miles away, we might run over something before then "
"TO: "
"Niles: You know, I am so tired, I can barely read this menu. "
"Frasier: It's all right, Niles. You don't have to read. You can just point to a picture of the food you want "
"Martin: What's this? 'A Log Roller with your choice of cheese.' You can't have a Log Roller without American cheese "
"Frasier: Apparently you can't get anything in this restaurant without American cheese. Including the menu "
"Martin: Niles, if you're so tired, why don't you go back to the Road Warrior and take a nap? "
"Niles: Oh, you know, that's a good idea. At least it'll be quiet. "
"Martin: I wonder if you can still get Sticky Shingles here? "
"Niles: One look at the salad bar says yes. "
"Martin: What looks good to you, Fras? "
"Frasier: Well, actually, Dad, you know, I think I'll have a hamburger. "
"Frasier: Would you order that for me, Dad? "
"Martin: Yeah. You're going some place? "
"Frasier: As a matter of fact, I am. I'm going to take a chance and reacquaint myself with an old friend of "
"mine: America. "
"Frasier: Hello there. Could I buy you a cup of coffee? You see, I'm just a wandering city mouse, trying to get in touch with America. Now, you, you look like you be a farmer. "
"Farmer: Oh, I get it. You see a guy in a rural diner wearing shabby clothes and you pin your little label on him. Well guess what, I am a farmer, but I'm also a beautiful, flawed, complicated human being and it's going to take more than a cup of coffee to get inside here. "
"Frasier: I'll just go see how my father's doing. "
"Martin: How was he? "
"Frasier: Beautiful, flawed, unpleasant. "
"Martin: Well, according to the map it's about three hundred miles to Sun Valley. "
"Frasier: Oh, that's delightful, Dad. You know what, we'll get there in plenty of time for the party. "
"Martin: Now listen, you know, your brother's going to be hungry, maybe we should bring him a sandwich. "
"Frasier: I wouldn't worry about Niles, Dad. "
"Frasier: He's so tired, let's just let him sleep for the rest of the trip. "
"Martin: Are you sure? "
"Frasier: Oh sure. It's the most exciting day of the year, Dad. For God's sakes, you know, when Niles wakes up I guarantee the last thing he'll be thinking about is sandwiches "
"Betty: Oh my goodness. Look what I just found in my pocket, the lighter I borrowed from that waitress in the restaurant. I feel terrible "
"Clifford: Forget it, Mother. We're not taking it back. "
"Betty: Well, I really think we should just turn around and say we're sorry and return it. "
"Clifford: I think we ought to keep it. Our old one's nearly out of fuel anyway. "
"Betty: It doesn't make it right. We're still criminals in the eyes of the law. "
"Clifford: There's a lot worse criminals than you and me. Do you remember that last gun show we went to? We must have seen at least three different people swiping boxes of shells. "
"Betty: There's one thing you can say for us, we pay for our ammo "
"TO: "
"Martin: So at this party tonight, there going to be a lot of shagnificent birds? "
"Frasier: Dad, I'm begging you. "
"Frasier: Hello? Niles, would you please stop doing this "
"TO: "
"Clifford: I'm getting a little drowsy. "
"Betty: Well, if you're so tired, just scootch over, I'll take the wheel. "
"Niles: Yes, yes, hello. I'm being kidnapped, this is an emergency, I'm being kidnapped. I'm in a stolen Winnebago heading east on I-84. I can't talk any louder, I'm being stolen. Yes, yes. Washington plates, R-D-W-R-E-"
"R: Road Warrior. Yes, it does. It does so, sound it out. Oh, never mind, for God's sake, just save me "
"Clifford: You know what, I'm getting sleepy, I'm going back for a little lie-down. "
"Betty: All right. [as Clifford is just about to enter the sleeping quarters] Oh wait Dad, look, there's another one of those 'Little Red Cabin''s. Why don't we just stop and have some supper first? "
"Clifford: 'Cause I'm tired and I'm not hungry. "
"Betty: Clifford "
"Clifford: Well, I guess a sandwich wouldn't kill me. "
"Betty: I feel sort of funny even stopping here, it's a little like returning to the scene of the crime. "
"Clifford: Mother Let it go "
"TO: "
"Martin: All right, Eddie. Let's go sign nature's guest book "
"Frasier: Hello. "
"Niles: Frasier. "
"Frasier: Yes. "
"Niles: Niles. "
"Niles: Put your fears to rest, I've got Dad's Winnebago back "
"Frasier: Niles, what on earth are you talking about? You must have had a nightmare? "
"Niles: Indeed I have, but it's over now and I've managed to give the thugs a taste of their own thieving medicine "
"Frasier: Niles Niles, where are you calling from? "
"Niles: From behind the wheel of the 'Road Warrior' and doing a damn fine job driving it too, I might add. "
"Frasier: Well, I'm in the 'Road Warrior' You got in the wrong car, you idiot You've stolen a Winnebago "
"Niles: Don't be absurd. "
"Niles: OH MY GOD "
"Frasier: All right, Niles. Just keep your head, there's no need to panic "
"Officer: This is the police Exit the vehicle immediately with your hands above your head. "
"TO: "
"Betty: How's that turkey club, Dad? "
"Clifford: A little dry. "
"TO: "
"Officer: Sorry about the misunderstanding. These papers all check out, sir. "
"Martin: Well, if there's nothing else, we're in a hurry to get to Sun Valley. "
"Frasier: But, not too much of a hurry. "
"Officer: Well, drive safely. "
"Martin: Thank you. "
"Martin: What a clown. I can tell you ten things he did wrong right off the bat. "
"Frasier: Well, at least he was apologetic. "
"Martin: Oh, these hick towns give any bozo a badge. [the officer appears at the window and overhears] A goober like that wouldn't last ten minutes in a real police force. [notices the peeved officer] ...without getting a promotion "
"Officer: Your license "
"Frasier: Hello. "
"Niles: Hello, Frasier. I managed to solve the problem, I returned the Winnebago. "
"Frasier: To where? Where are you? "
"Niles: Well, I'm in Baker City, Oregon. "
"Frasier: Baker City? "
"Martin: Shag me rotten That's three hundred miles "
"Frasier: Niles, we will never get there and then back to Sun Valley before midnight. "
"Niles: Well I'm not going to ring in the new year in a 'Little Red Cabin.' "
"Frasier: All right, all right, listen, the only way we can ever pull this off is if you can catch a ride in this direction. "
"Niles: Hold on, hold on. "
"Betty: Oh my gosh, it's engraved. Dad, I'm not going to enjoy the rest of this trip until I return this woman's lighter. "
"Clifford: Mother, do you expect me to turn around and drive a hundred and fifty miles back to that Little Red Cabin? We are not going, end of discussion. "
"Betty: Clifford. "
"Niles: "
"TO: The Winnebago. "
"Frasier: Niles says he can make it back to the restaurant where we first got separated, all I have to do now is to turn this boat around. "
"Martin: Thirty miles to the next exit. "
"Frasier: I can't wait that long "
"Martin: Well, you can't do a U-ey on an interstate. "
"Frasier: That's twentieth century talk, Dad. Welcome to the future "
"Frasier: God, that felt great Wow, this is really quite an adventure, isn't it, Dad "
"Martin: It is now. "
"Frasier: Oh, dear God. "
"Martin: All right, just relax, Frasier. Now, I know cops. Just let me do the talking, and we'll be out of here in two minutes. "
"Frasier: All right Dad, let's switch. "
"Officer: Well, look who's here. Do you boys know what you did wrong back there? "
"Martin: Yeah, yeah, I know, a U-turn. "
"Officer: Nope, called me a goober "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Niles, I'm so sorry we're late. "
"Niles: Ah, well. Not to worry, when you're here at the cross-roads of the world you have the human drama to amuse you. "
"Martin: Well, happy new year, boys. "
"Frasier: Yes, five minutes ago Everyone in the world will have a wonderful story to tell about where they were and what they were doing when the Millennium dawned. What is our story? Speeding along a lonely highway and you here doing nothing. "
"Niles: Well, not exactly nothing. Big Sandy let me watch the register while she emptied the rat traps. "
"Martin: Hey, wait a minute, where are we? "
"Frasier: Well, Dad, I've never seen a picture of the official middle of nowhere, but I assume... "
"Martin: Yeah, yeah, yeah, but the middle of nowhere, Mountain Time, right? It's still only 11"
":05 Pacific Time. "
"Niles: Which can't be more than forty-five minutes from here. "
"Martin: Right We can cross the line and toast in the new year. "
"Frasier: Dad, that's brilliant And there was a delightful little restaurant just across the border. "
"Martin: Well, the guide book said it was pretentious. "
"Frasier: Perfect, let's roll "
"TO: "
"Frasier: We're running out of time "
"Martin: Well, I'm doing my best, Frasier, but we seem to be losing power. "
"Frasier: What's that noise? What's wrong with the engine? "
"Niles: I didn't touch the emergency brake "
"Martin: When’s the last time you put gas in this thing? "
"Frasier: Me? I don't even know where the thing is to put the gas into. "
"Martin: Oh, no. I'm sorry, boys. It's dying, I'm going to be lucky to get this off the road. "
"Frasier: I can't stand this Have we so offended the Millennium gods that they will do anything to ruin this evening? Burn down our restaurant? Hurl vindictive lawmen and duplicate Winnebagos in our path to confound us? "
"Martin: Hey, is that a sign? "
"Frasier: Of course it's a sign It's a sign that we're cursed "
"Martin: No, no, it is, it's a sign "
"Martin: We're entering Pacific Time Zone We're here "
"Frasier: We made it Come on, Eddie Thirty seconds to spare. "
"Frasier: We're rolling We're rolling backwards. "
"Martin: Oh, no "
"Niles: No need to panic, Frasier. "
"Niles: Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha "
"Martin: We rolled back into Idaho "
"Frasier: Follow me "
"Frasier: Ten seconds, let's look alive. Damn this foil "
"Martin: You can do it, Fras, relax and focus. "
"Niles: Three, two, one.... "
"Martin: Oh-ho, we made it Happy New Year "
"Niles: Happy New Year "
"Niles: Well, if you ask me, this beats a dull party. "
"Martin: Yeah... "
"Niles: Family and good champagne and a blanket of stars. "
"Frasier: Hear, hear. "
"Frasier: You know what, I think this calls for a song. 'Should auld acquaintance be forgot...' "
"All: '...and never brought to mind. Should-' "
"All: 'Should-old-acquaintance-be-forgot-for-Auld-Lang- Syne...' "

"Skyline: A moon rises above the city. "
"Frasier: And we'll be right back after this short news break. "
"Gil: Frasier...I'm here to give you an advance tip. "
"Frasier: Really? "
"Roz: Hey, Gil. "
"Gil: Roz I'm about to review a divine new Italian trattoria I've discovered called 'Bella, Bella.' "
"Frasier: Ah-ha. "
"Gil: I'm alerting you now because once I review it, reservations will be impossible to come by. "
"Frasier: Well, thank you, Gil, it's always gratifying to be a few minutes ahead of a trend. "
"Gil: They make an osso bucco that's so divine I call it the 'Veal Shank Redemption.' "
"Kenny: Hey, guys. "
"Frasier: Hello, Kenny. "
"Kenny: Show's going great, Frasier, uh, only one thing missing, of course... "
"Frasier: I know, I know, a new theme song. I'm sorry, I just haven't gotten around to it yet. "
"Kenny: Well, Mrs. Delafield's been hounding me on this. She really thinks each show having a theme song will help hook the listeners. Gil's got his. "
"Gil: My first choice was 'Food, Glorious Food' from the show Oliver "
"Frasier: Ooh, that's a perfect match. Haute cuisine and a chorus of starving orphans. "
"Gil: But then, a composer friend of mine came up with this little ditty for me Whether choosing a wine Or the best place to dine-- It's all a matter of taste (Yes, sir) It's all a matter of taste "
"Kenny: Great, huh? "
"Gil: And the nicest thing is, he didn't take a penny for it "
"Frasier: Well, at least he has a conscience. "
"Frasier: You know, Kenny, I'm sorry for procrastinating this thing. I-I tell you, I'll get one as soon as I possibly can. "
"Kenny: Well, you better come up with something here. I'm sorry to be a hard-ass. It's the part of my job I hate the most, but I need this thing on my desk by Monday...ish. "
"Frasier: You know, Roz - hearing Gil's little ditty puts me in mind that maybe we should just do - ah, an original song. "
"Roz: Well, my new boyfriend Leon is in a band. He could write one for you. "
"Frasier: Well, actually, I was thinking of composing it myself. I am not without musical ability, you know. "
"Roz: Could you at least hire Leon to accompany you? "
"Frasier: I take it he's desperate for work? "
"Roz: Hasn't had a gig in months. Music is all he knows. He's not good at anything else - except in bed. It's what he does best. "
"Frasier: Yeah. How long did it take you to find that out? "
"Roz: Ten seconds, Frasier. "
"Frasier: Oh, longer than usual. "
"Niles: Frasier. "
"Frasier: Oh, Niles. Oh, dear. We had dinner plans tonight, didn't we? "
"Niles: Yes. Don't tell me you're canceling. "
"Frasier: Well, I have to. I have a little project this evening. "
"Niles: Oh. Would this have anything to do with this new theme song you promised your listeners? "
"Frasier: As a matter of fact, it does. I've got to have something by Monday, and I thought I'd take advantage of a nice quiet evening at home. "
"Frasier: Oh. Daphne - Daphne Would you please turn off that vacuum cleaner? "
"Daphne: It's not a vacuum cleaner. It's the 'Dirt Scourge 2000.' A total cleansing system. "
"Martin: Is it new? "
"Daphne: Yeah. I got it this afternoon. You see, this water traps all of the dirt particles instead of recycling them back into the air. I got all that from Dr. Crane's pillow. "
"Martin: Ew. "
"Niles: I've been begging you to switch to a more abrasive loofah. "
"Daphne: Well, it would be the same for anyone. Dead skin, dust mites... that's what we're all sleeping on, only we don't know it. "
"Martin: We do now. Geez. "
"Daphne: This is the chance I've been waiting for. "
"Frasier: Well. Apparently the 'Dirt Scourge 2000' is no match for the 'Dirt Pile 1957.' "
"Daphne: Well, this is going back. On the commercial they clean all the mud off a hippopotamus. "
"Frasier: Well, at least now I can get down to work. You know, Niles, I'm sorry again about dinner, but can I buy you a sherry? "
"Niles: Oh... thank you. About this theme song of yours... why don't you just use a standard? "
"Frasier: Actually, I want to compose one myself. I've always had an affinity for music, and I've often wondered what I might achieve if I just rolled up my sleeves and gave it a try. "
"Martin: Didn't you write some kind of musical back in prep school? "
"Frasier: Yes, I did, Dad. Niles was in it. You know, the whole school came out humming my opening anthem. "
"Niles: They went in humming it. It was Beethoven's Ninth Symphony note for note. "
"Frasier: It was not. "
"Niles: It absolutely was. "
"Frasier: It was not at all. "
"Niles: [singing to the tune of the 'Ode to Joy' theme from the finale of Beethoven's "
"Ninth:] We are valiant men of honor Wenching, brawling sons of... "
"Frasier: All right, all right, well, I suppose I may have borrowed a Note or two as a launching pad. "
"Niles: Prancing, leaping, laughing... "
"Frasier: All right, point taken. "
"Niles: Over hill and... "
"Frasier: Stop it "
"Niles: I'm just teasing. Actually, it was a wonderful show. I was very proud to be acting in it. "
"Frasier: You know, Niles, you were wonderful in it as well. "
"Niles: Well, thank you, I thought so. "
"Frasier: Mm-hmm. "
"Niles: I often thought if I'd kept at it, I could have been a professional actor. "
"Frasier: Ah, you see, we all have a road not taken, some unfinished business worth exploring. "
"Martin: Yeah, I always wanted to be a toe dancer, but a bullet ended my dream. "
"Niles: Well, Frasier, if you need any help with this, I'm right here. "
"Frasier: Thank you, Niles. You know, I'd rather handle the composing chores myself, but I could use a sounding board. "
"Niles: Fair enough, let's put our heads together. "
"Frasier: All right. "
"Niles: Figuratively speaking, of course. I saw what came out of your pillow. "
"TO: "
"Niles: You know, I think this new bridge is the best thing you've written. "
"Frasier: Really? "
"Niles: Oh, absolutely. "
"himself: "
"Niles: Claustrophobia Nymphomania He will probe ya He'll explain t'ya It's brilliant. "
"Frasier: You know, it does have a Cole Porter-y, Stephen Sondheim-y flavor, doesn't it? "
"Niles: Oh, absolutely. Sondheim-y would have killed to have written this. "
"Frasier: You know what? I'm a little nervous. It just may be a bit too conventional. Perhaps instead of a regular bridge, I could substitute it with a dramatic monologue spoken against a musical background. "
"Niles: I like it. "
"Frasier: Of course, I would have to hire an actor. "
"Niles: Yes, I suppose you could squander a lot of money on some so- Called professional... someone who doesn't know a thing about psychiatry. Who doesn't understand the whole Gestalt. "
"Frasier: Or maybe you could do it. "
"Niles: I think so. "
"Frasier: I will write you a speech that will challenge your entire histrionic range This is so exciting Let's play the chorus again. "
"Martin: Hey, hey, Fras I just got an idea for your little jingle. It came to me while I was brushing my teeth. What's new? I'm listenin' Feelin' blue? I'm listenin'... Cause, you know, that's what you say on your show. Feelin' sad, feelin' mad, feelin' glad, feelin' bad I'm listenin' "
"Daphne: Bravo That's wonderful. "
"Martin: Thanks, you know, it's catchy. That's what counts in a jingle. "
"interest: John Mahoney appeared on the Cheers episode “Do Not "
"Frasier: Uh-huh, well, that's very, very nice, Dad, it's just that, well, you know, I did promise my listeners that I'd compose this myself. It's no fair cheating. "
"Martin: Oh, well, it's not cheating, technically... "
"Frasier: Very good, Dad, very good, but thank you, and off you go. "
"Martin: Okay, all right. "
"Niles: Hey, um, Frasier, are you sure you want to modulate here? That may just complicate things. "
"Frasier: Perhaps. You know, I'm just trying to make it interesting. To my ear, there's still something lacking, some tiny ingredient that's missing. I'm not sure what. "
"Frasier: All right, everyone. Let's try this again. We still have a few minutes before the choir gets here. "
"Frasier: Well, finally, the choir has deigned to join us. "
"Director: Sorry, our bus broke down. We had to walk two miles to get here. "
"Frasier: Ah, then I suppose we can dispense with the breathing exercises I was going to recommend. Please, if you would. Off you go. "
"Niles: Uh, Frasier... did you mean to cut paragraph five of my monologue? "
"Frasier: Gosh, I might have, Niles. I've just been so busy. What was the gist? "
"Niles: A lighthearted lampoon of mental health care abuse. "
"Frasier: Ah, yes, I did. I was afraid that some fussbudget might take offense at my jape about lobotomies. "
"Niles: Well, I suppose it's best to play it safe, although I did Like the way you indicated manic depression with a slide whistle. "
"Niles: Do we really have to use so many musicians? "
"Frasier: For the sound I want, yes. "
"Niles: Whatever happened to the concept of 'less is more'? "
"Frasier: Ah, but if less is more, just think of how much more 'more' will be. "
"Frasier: You may be seated. "
"Frasier: Ladies and gentlemen, if I may have your attention, please, I'd like to take a few minutes to explain my artistic vision. "
"Timpanist: Take as long as you want, we're all on the clock. "
"Frasier: Point well taken, moving right along... "
"Roz: Frasier...I'm sorry we're late. We got stuck in traffic. Some stupid bus broke down. This is Leon. "
"Frasier: Ah, hello, Leon. "
"Leon: Hey, Dr. Crane. "
"Frasier: Lovely to meet you. Listen, why don't you help yourself to the refreshment table there. I need to have a few words with Roz. "
"Frasier: Roz, we've got a problem In scoring this, I had to eliminate the guitar part. "
"Roz: Well, put it back. "
"Frasier: Well, I can't. I'm afraid another instrument might make Things sound cluttered... unless, of course, Leon can play the bagpipe. "
"Roz: The bagpipe? "
"Frasier: Yes Our show deals with a whole range of human emotion from euphoria to despair, and nothing says despair so quickly as the skirl of a bagpipe. "
"Roz: Nothing says 'Turn off the radio' so quickly either. Isn't there something else he can play? "
"Frasier: Well, uh... yes, yes Actually, our triangle player called in with a touch of tinnitus. Here we are. "
"Frasier: Leon, I have some good news for you. I had to eliminate the Guitar part, but I'm promoting you to first triangle. "
"Leon: Uh, I've never played one of these. It looks tricky. "
"Roz: I'll work with him. "
"Frasier: Yes, off you go. "
"Frasier: Well, then, now people, before we start, are there any questions? "
"Frasier: Yes, viola. "
"Tiffany: My name is Tiffany. "
"Frasier: No, no no. I'm calling you by your instrument name, so as to avoid confusion. "
"Tiffany: Oh, well I have a question about measure 34... "
"Frasier: Ah... I thought you might. Yes, you see, I've accelerated the tempo there in order to depict the yearning of the superego. Very perceptive of you to spot that. "
"Tiffany: No, I meant, are these eighth notes or what? "
"Frasier: Yes... eighth notes. Anyone else? "
"Frasier: Yes, timpani? "
"Tiffany: You just answered my question. "
"Frasier: Not Tiffany, timpani. "
"Timpanist: What are we rehearsing this for? Are we going to record it? "
"Frasier: Yes, actually, we are waiting for the final go-ahead from my station manager, and then we will be recording it, yes. Anyone else? "
"Frasier: Yes... actor. "
"Niles: I'm just wondering how my monologue is going to be audible over all these instruments. "
"Frasier: Oh, that's a good point, Niles. You may be seated. It is imperative that everyone play during the spoken portions - very, very softly. That applies particularly to brass and timpani. "
"Tiffany: Why me? "
"Frasier: To the drums, Tiffany. "
"Frasier: Oh, Dad, Daphne, I'm so glad you came "
"Daphne: Oh, well, after all, it is the world premiere of your theme song. "
"Frasier: Now, I don't have to search you two for any hidden recording devices, do I? The last thing I need is some bootleg CD's flooding the marketplace. "
"Martin: Boy, you really got everything here "
"Frasier: Oh, it's not a time for stinting, Dad. I've got everything from the African rain stick to the Javanese tam-tam. "
"Martin: Are the tam-tams the long ones with the cream in the middle? "
"Frasier: Oh, Kenny, Kenny I'm so glad you made it. Listen, I think you're in for a bit of a surprise. "
"Kenny: Well, I gotta tell you, I don't surprise easily. [seeing the orchestra] Whoa "
"Frasier: Our little ensemble. Heh-heh. "
"Kenny: So many musicians... all working on a weekend. "
"Frasier: Now, listen, I realize that we are a bit over budget, and I promise, I will pick up the difference myself. "
"Frasier: All right. The time has come to unveil my magnum opus. Just Let me do a little fine-tuning on the opening fanfare. "
"Frasier: Uh, brass, if you will please, in four, the first measure? "
"Frasier: Well, you see, that's fine as far as it goes, but this time I want you to do it with a bit more... grandeur. With some majesty and a soupcon of awe. "
"Frasier: There, you see. That's what good conducting can do. "
"Frasier: All right, everyone. The time we have been waiting for is at hand. And with a simple bow of thanks to the muse Calliope, let us begin. And... "

"Finally: "
"Kenny: Wow. "
"Frasier: Takes your breath away, doesn't it? "
"Kenny: Wow. "
"Frasier: I thought as much, and in anticipation of your approval, I had the forethought to order in a little bubbly. Niles, if you would help me, please? "
"Frasier: Oh, you were wonderful "
"Niles: Thank you, the trombone frightened me. "
"Kenny: Wow. "
"Martin: Well that was sure something, wasn't it? "
"Daphne: I'll say. Sort of like Gilbert and Sullivan – only frightening. "
"Kenny: A little jingle, that's all we wanted. Yeah, ten seconds to start the show. "
"Roz: Well, maybe Frasier can cut this down... "
"Kenny: He gives me harps and drums and... people speaking German. All we wanted was a simple little jingle. "
"Daphne: Probably more like the one you came up with. Tell him yours, Mr. Crane. "
"Martin: No, no, no, it was nothing. I can't even remember how it goes. "
"Daphne: Well, I do. How are you? I'm listen... "
"Martin: No, it doesn't go like that. "
"Kenny: Well, then you sing it, Mr. Crane. "
"Martin: Well, all right... but it's really nothing. "
"jingle: "
"Martin: What's new? I'm listenin' Feelin' blue? I'm listenin'... Feelin' sad, feelin' mad, feelin' bad, feelin' glad I'm listenin' "
"Kenny: That's exactly the kind of thing we're looking for "
"Kenny: You know, it sets the mood, it - it says it all. Did that just pop into your head? "
"Frasier: Hardly. It was gut-wrenching, but you know, it's nice to know that I made it look easy. "
"Kenny: No, no, no. I'm talking about your dad's little jingle. "
"Frasier: Dad's? "
"Kenny: Yeah, he just sang it. It's exactly the type of thing we need. You know, simple, catchy...you know, we ought to just use that one. "
"Frasier: No, no, Kenny, no. I mean, if simple is what you wanted, you should have just said so. "
"Kenny: I thought I did. "
"Frasier: Well, obviously not. Now that I know what you want, well, there's nothing easier. Of course I can write simple. I promise you, it'll be something far more memorable than what my dad came up with. "
"Kenny: Well, I don't know, I remember it...sings What's new? I'm listenin' "
"Choir: Feelin' blue? I'm listenin'... Feelin' sad, feelin' mad, feelin' bad, feelin' glad I'm listenin' "
"Frasier: You're off the clock "
"TO: "
"Martin: Hey, Fras. How's it goin'? "
"Frasier: 'Merrily, merrily.' "
"Martin: Well, you know, it's getting kind of late. Maybe you should call it a night, huh? "
"Frasier: Dad, you heard Kenny. I have to come up with something as simple as yours by Monday. By the way, thanks once again for completely upstaging me today. "
"Martin: Oh, come on, I'm sorry I stole your thunder, but it's not like I did it on purpose. "
"Frasier: I know. I know. I'm sorry. It's just... I don't know why I'm having such a hard time with this. "
"Martin: Well... maybe you're just thinking too much. I mean, look at me. I go to the bathroom, I'm flossing my teeth, and that song pops into my head. "
"Frasier: Are you suggesting that I bring out a spool of floss? "
"Martin: Well, it might not be a bad idea, for a couple of reasons. "
"Martin: Frasier, why don't you just decide what you want to say and Say it? Not a lot of big words and showing off. You know, and the tune should be something simple - something you can whistle. I tried whistling that thing you wrote today, and I got lightheaded. Of course, it might have been that last doughnut. I went back for one of those African rainsticks. Ooh... "
"Frasier: The truth is, Dad, I've... I'm not sure I can do simple. "
"Martin: Well, I don't know if you can't or if you just don't want to. And you know, some of the best things in the world are simple, Fras. Just like that art gallery you took me to a couple of months ago. Do you remember? You were oohing and ahhing at this painting of a big red dot. "
"Frasier: Yeah, Dad, but there is a difference between simple and deceptively simple. "
"Martin: Well, all I'm saying is that it's fine to be smart, but you shouldn't have to be proving it all the time, that's all. You know, just as an experiment, tell me what it is you're trying to say stripped down to nuts and bolts. "
"Frasier: All right, um... in my first stanza, I want to represent myself as the... ombudsman between the conscious and subconscious minds of my listeners. "
"Martin: Ah. Well, there you are, that's the song right there. All we need is a rhyme for 'ombudsman' and we can go to bed. "
"Frasier: Well, I was playing around with 'north woodsman.' "
"Martin: Oh, Frasier. Look, I'm going to tell you what your show's "
"about: People have a problem, they're feeling low, they call you, you make them feel better. "
"Frasier: Oh, for God's sake, Dad. "
"Martin: Well, that's it That's it. Why don't you just write about that? "
"Frasier: How would that sound exactly? If you've got a problem If you're feelin' low Lookin' for some answers... Oh, gosh, now I'm stuck. How will I ever find a rhyme for 'low'? "
"Martin: Okay, smart-aleck. I was just trying to help. "
"Frasier: Well, thanks, Dad. I'm sorry, you know, it's just not my thing. "
"Martin: Okay, well, I'm going to bed. So, if you need any help tomorrow, all you got to do is ask. "
"Frasier: Thanks, Dad. "
"it: "
"Frasier: If you've got a problem... If you're feelin' low Lookin' for some answers... "
"Martin: Things you need to know "
"Vocalists: If you've got a problem If you're feelin' low Lookin' for some answers Things you need to know, All you've got to do is ask (tempo slows) All you've got to do is ask. "

"Roz: Frasier, thank God you're here. "
"Frasier: Why, what's wrong, Roz? "
"Roz: My book club meets tonight and I haven't read the book. "
"Frasier: Oh my, that is a literary 911 Wait, you joined a book club? "
"Roz: Why is that so hard to believe? I like to read. "
"Frasier: What's his name? "
"Roz: Jason. "
"Frasier: A-ha. "
"Roz: We met at a book store and he asked me to join his club. He's separated, but I think it's for keeps. He was buying 'Divorce for Dummies.' "
"Frasier: Sounds like a real catch, Roz. "
"Roz: Anyway, I was supposed to read 'The Great Gatsby' last night but I couldn't get Alice to sleep. So could you give me a quick summary? "
"Frasier: Well, all right, er, it was a time known as the Jazz Age. Wall Street was booming, bootleg hooch was flowing and the young people were doing a new dance called the Charleston. "
"Roz: Where were you when I was trying to get Alice to sleep, could you just get to it already? "
"Frasier: Oh, all right, fine. [notices a blond woman who has just entered] Lorna Lenley "
"Roz: Okay, who's she? Gatsby's girlfriend? "
"Frasier: The woman who just walked in. She was the great beauty of my high school. She had brains, looks, style and the way she filled out a mohair sweater - well, suffice it to say it was snugger on her than on the goat "
"Roz: Why don't you go over and say hello? "
"Frasier: Oh God, Roz, she wouldn't even remember me. She was with the in-crowd. The only people that knew me debated, recited or were on a six-month visit from Abu Dhabi God, she's coming over, she's coming over, she's coming over "
"Lorna: Excuse me, didn't we go to high school together? "
"Frasier: Did we? "
"Lorna: Yes, I thought you looked familiar. You're Frasier, aren't you? "
"Frasier: Well, that's right. All right, let me guess, em, Lisa? "
"Lorna: Lorna. "
"Frasier: Oh yes, of course. Hello. Roz, I'd like you to meet Lorna Ann Lenley. Anywhere close? "
"Lorna: Very good Although it's Gardner now, but I'm going back to Lenley, I was recently divorced. "
"Frasier: Oh gosh, I'm sorry to hear that. Er, Roz our chatting isn't bothering your reading is it? "
"Roz: Oh no, actually I... Oh right, off I go "
"Frasier: So, er, I'm divorced myself actually. "
"Lorna: Yes, I know, I listen to your show. "
"Frasier: Really? "
"Lorna: Well, I sell Real Estate, so I'm in my car all the time. So whenever I can, I turn you on. "
"Frasier: Oh, my. "
"Lorna: Excuse me, I'll have to get that. "
"Frasier: No problemo. Roz, she's just as lovely as ever. "
"Roz: So, are you going to ask her out? "
"Frasier: Oh right, Legs Lenley and Crane the Brain - in my dreams "
"Roz: Frasier, you act like you're still some dorky teenager; you're a charming, successful man. "
"Frasier: Thank you, Roz. "
"Roz: No problemo. "
"Lorna: Excuse me, I have to go show a house. Frasier, it was really nice to see you again. "
"Frasier: Oh, likewise. Er, Lorna, listen, I realise that this is out of the blue and you're very busy but I was wondering if you might like to... "
"Lorna: Yes? "
"Frasier: ...appraise my apartment. You see, I've decided to sell it. "
"Lorna: Sure, I'd be happy to. In fact I'm free tonight. "
"Frasier: Really? Well, how's seven 'o clock? I live at the Elliot Bay Towers. "
"Lorna: Oh, wow What a great building "
"Frasier: Yes, well. "
"Lorna: You've certainly done well for yourself. "
"Frasier: Yes, well, I think you'll find we've both come a long way since high school. You know, here, let me carry those for you. "
"Frasier: Dad She'll be here any minute. "
"Martin: Okay, I'm leaving. "
"Frasier: Listen, I'm sorry to uproot you like this. "
"Martin: Oh, it's all right. I'd rather clear the decks for a date than for one of your theme parties. Although I am kinda sorry I missed 'An Evening With Moe Howard.' "
"Frasier: That was Noel Coward "
"Frasier: Oh, Niles, what are you doing here? "
"Niles: Well, I've got a crisis. Tomorrow's Mel's birthday and I'm planning a very romantic evening but my Gagino is on the fritz. "
"Martin: Oh jeez, I don't need to hear this "
"Frasier: Dad It's a stove "
"Martin: I know; six burners and a griddle, don't you guys ever talk about cars? "
"Niles: Frasier, I'm desperate, can I possibly use your kitchen tomorrow to prepare the meal? "
"Frasier: Yes, of course, Niles. But listen, now you've got to go, I have a date. "
"Niles: Oh Anyone I know? "
"Frasier: Well, as a matter of fact, "
"yes: Lorna Lenley. "
"Niles: Oooh No, really, who? "
"Frasier: It's true, I bumped into her today at the Café. "
"Niles: Lorna Lenley? You, sir, have moxy Why, even with all my vested authority as hall monitor I could never muster the courage to ask to see her bathroom pass. And you asked her out Whoa I bow down before you, I doff my cap to you. "
"Frasier: Well, actually it's not really a date. "
"Niles: I knew it "
"Frasier: You see, she's coming over to appraise the apartment. She's in Real Estate and I tried to ask her out and I choked. I did get the impression that she was interested in me, though. "
"Niles: Well of course she is. Oh and the coach called, you're starting the big game on Sunday. "
"Frasier: All right, Niles, off you go. "
"Frasier: She's here. You've got one quick 'hello' and then you're gone, mister. "
"Lorna: Hello, Frasier. "
"Frasier: Lorna, good to see you again. Perhaps you remember my brother, Niles. "
"Lorna: Yes, hello Niles. "
"Frasier: Well, now that you two have had a chance to catch up, I'll see you later. "
"Lorna: Nice to see you again, Niles. "
"Lorna: Oh, Frasier, wow What a great apartment "
"Frasier: Thank you. "
"Lorna: Why are you selling it? "
"Frasier: Oh, I don't want to bore you with the details, it's a very long, very complicated story. "
"Lorna: Well, I'd love to hear it. "
"Frasier: Er, well, I need more closet space. Could I interest you in some wine? "
"Lorna: Oh, I would love some. "
"Lorna: Do you remember Chip Clayton's graduation party? Remember when we broke into his father's liquor cabinet and we made sangria out of a hundred dollar bottle of wine? "
"Frasier: No. "
"Lorna: You know, I should make some notes on your apartment. [she begins to] "
"Frasier: What are you doing? Tell her why you really asked her over and drop this ridiculous charade. You're not sixteen years old any longer. "
"Lorna: Frasier, I'd love to see your bedroom. "
"Frasier: Of course. Lorna Lenley wants to see my bedroom "
"Lorna: Oh, Frasier, wow, another great room. "
"Frasier: Thank you. "
"Lorna: Is this bed Scandinavian? "
"Frasier: You have a good eye. Lorna Lenley's on my bed Stop acting like an adolescent "
"Lorna: Frasier, are you all right? "
"Frasier: No, no, actually Lorna, I'm not all right. You see, when I saw you this afternoon I immediately flashed back to the hopeless crush I had on you in high school. Of course it didn't help matters much that you've hardly changed a bit and I wanted to ask you out and I lost my nerve. "
"Lorna: You mean all of this was just a ruse to get me up here? "
"Frasier: I'm afraid so. So, now that I've sufficiently embarrassed myself, I'll show you out. "
"Lorna: You know, Frasier, I have to say I'm really very flattered. "
"Frasier: Really? "
"Lorna: Yes. You know, it's not too late to ask me out. "
"Frasier: Would you like to have dinner with me this evening? "
"Lorna: I'd love to. "
"Frasier: Wonderful. "
"Frasier: I'm going out with Lorna Lenley 2 GOOD 2 BE 4 GOTTEN "
"Lorna: Hi. "
"Frasier: Hi. "
"Lorna: I had a wonderful time last night. "
"Frasier: Me too. It's like being back in high school, but with sex. "
"Lorna: I don't want this to end. "
"Frasier: I must warn you, now that I've learned to finally ask you out, I'll be doing a lot more of it. Are you free this evening? You see, there I go already. How about tomorrow night? Somebody stop me. "
"Lorna: Not me I wonder what time it is? "
"Frasier: Hm, well, ten 'o clock. "
"Lorna: Oh crap, I'm late "
"Frasier: Is there something I can do? "
"Lorna: Oh, yeah, make this lousy hangover go away. Where the hell are those aspirins. "
"Frasier: You know, perhaps I should get you a glass of water for those. Would you prefer sparkling or still? "
"Frasier: Or not, I see you're fine. "
"Lorna: Oh, I'm sorry, did you want to finish this? "
"Frasier: No, no, you're the guest. "
"Lorna: Yeah, it's me, I'm running late. Move my ten- thirty to eleven thirty. Just move it to eleven thirty "
"Frasier: I didn't realise you smoked? "
"Lorna: Oh, I'm always trying to quit but my weight just balloons up. trust me, you don't want to see my ass when I'm off these things "
"Frasier: You know, I hate to be a fusspot but I'd prefer... "
"Lorna: Yeah? Well, who let the dog in? Put your brother on Put your brother on Put your brother on Would you be a sweetie and make me some coffee? "
"Frasier: Okay. "
"Lorna: You know that mess better be cleaned up by the time I get home. Both of you Put your brother on Put your brother on Put your brother on the phone "
"Lorna: Oh, this is nice. "
"Martin: I still don't understand why you have to do all the cooking. Why don't you just take Mel out for a nice meal? "
"Niles: Well, because through cooking I can truly express my feelings for her. You know, the French have a saying... "
"Martin: Okay, okay, I was just making conversation until we got home. "
"Frasier: Hi, dad. Hello, Niles. "
"Niles: I could really use some help preparing this dish today, if you're not busy. "
"Frasier: Oh gosh, Niles, I've got a lot errands to run. You know, why don't you ask Daphne? "
"Niles: Ah, all right. Oh, oh, oh, how did things go with Lorna? Did you summon up the courage to ask her out? "
"Frasier: Well, actually... "
"Niles: Oh come on, Frasier, seize the moment. Faint heart never won fair lady. You know, the French have a saying... "
"Lorna: Hi, Niles. "
"Lorna: Come here. I have some really great news. [lights a cigarette] "
"Frasier: Really? Do tell. "
"Lorna: Well, I called my office, and after my eleven-thirty I'm free for the rest of the day. "
"Frasier: Oh well, what are you planning on doing? "
"Lorna: Being with you, silly. "
"Woman: Excuse me. "
"Lorna: You know, you are the best thing that has happened to me in a long time. [kisses him and the gets into the lift before kissing him again, she finally gets "
"in:] I'm in, you happy? "
"Niles: Whisk. Spoon. [she hands it to him, he stirs] Cheesecloth. [she wipes his brow as he tastes before the oven pings] Perfect timing. Daphne, open the oven. Ready. "
"Daphne: Shall I close, Dr. Crane? "
"Niles: Please. "
"Daphne: Do you think it'll be all right? "
"Niles: It's out of our hands now, Daphne. "
"Niles: Thank you for your help. "
"Daphne: Oh, my pleasure. I haven't had this much fun in the kitchen since your brother caught his tie in the pasta machine. "
"Niles: Oh, and the real fun's just beginning - clean-up. "
"Daphne: Oh, you silly sod, here, run it under some cold water, I'll fetch the aloe cream. Come here. This'll help. "
"Niles: I can't believe I just did that. "
"Daphne: Oh, I do that sort of thing all the time. You must be careful, those pan handles get awfully hot. "
"Niles: Oh well, not anymore, it's got a protective coating of skin on it. "
"Daphne: Just give it a minute to absorb. "
"Niles: That'll be fine. I'm feeling better already. "
"Niles: Thanks, Daphne. "
"Martin: Hey, what's up? "
"Daphne: Nothing. Why should anything be up? Dr. Crane burnt his hand and I was tending to it, that's all. Oh my, look at the time, I've got to run. [she picks up the clock and then runs out] "
"Martin: Burnt, huh? Well, you might want to keep something cold on that. Here, you can hold my beer for me while I watch the game. "
"Niles: Hello, Frasier. "
"Frasier: Hello, Niles. How are you? "
"Niles: Fine. Although the oddest thing just happened. "
"Frasier: Oh, that man on the corner's name is Pete. If you give him a dollar his monkey won't make those rude gestures. "
"Niles: No, this is about Daphne. I burned my hand while I was cooking and she began putting first aid cream on it and in a very tender way and then, em, dad came in and she jumped as if she felt guilty. Is it possible Daphne has feelings for me? "
"Frasier: No. "
"Niles: Ah well, as long as you've considered it from all angles "
"Frasier: If she was tender it was because you burnt your hand, if she jumped it was because dad startled her. Come on, Niles, can't you see what's really going on here? "
"Niles: Well, obviously I haven't a clue. I thought that man's monkey was waving hello. "
"Frasier: Your relationship with Mel is growing deeper. Isn't it possible that your fear of commitment is driving your mind to throw up these imaginary road blocks? "
"Niles: You think so? "
"Frasier: Well, you do have a history with this. Remember the day after you proposed to Maris? You went that evening to the opera, you were convinced that Leontyne Price was winking at you the whole night. "
"Niles: I suppose there could be commitment issues here. Cooking a meal for one's mate is a big first step. "
"Frasier: Yes, especially for you. I mean Maris never let you cook for her. "
"Niles: That's true, the closest I ever got was re-stocking the pills in her bedside Lazy Susan. "
"Roz: Hey, guys. "
"Niles: Oh hey, Roz. Frasier, thank you. It's a big help. "
"Frasier: My pleasure, Niles. "
"Roz: Bye. "
"Frasier: Oh, Roz, I see the book club has moved on to 'Wuthering Heights.' Well... "
"Roz: Oh, please tell me they made a movie out of this. "
"Frasier: Twice. "
"Roz: Amen So how did your date with Lorna go? Did you get up enough nerve to ask her to dinner? "
"Frasier: To dinner and breakfast We spent the night together. "
"Roz: Whoa You went to bed with the prom queen? "
"Frasier: Yes, I woke up with 'Carrie' She smokes, she screams, she's uncouth, and I'm actually meeting her here to break it off. "
"Roz: So soon? "
"Frasier: Well... "
"Roz: With the way your love life's been going, you may want to squeeze a couple more dates out of it. You know, nuts for the winter "
"Frasier: Please, Roz, I could never do that sort of thing. Whenever I know that I have no future with a woman, I end it, right then and there. Especially a woman like Lorna, recently divorced and vulnerable... "
"Roz: You always take the high road. "
"Frasier: Well, you know, I like to think so. You know, if there's one thing I've learned, my old high school wounds are not going to be healed by sleeping with the prom queen. "
"Roz: Tell me about "
"it: prom queen, assistant principal. You can't go home again "
"Roz: Good luck. "
"Lorna: How are you doing, babycakes? [kisses him, breathing her cigarette breath into him] "
"Frasier: Thank you. Now, listen, Lorna about tomorrow night, em... "
"Lorna: Oh, I'm sorry, I know we have plans but I completely forgot. It's the retirement dinner for Coach Palet. "
"Frasier: Who? "
"Lorna: Our high school football coach. I'd love it if you'd go with me. "
"Frasier: Well, I have to be honest with you here... "
"Lorna: Oh, come on, it'll be fun. The old gang'll be there. "
"Frasier: The old gang, you say. You mean like Chip Clayton and Lad Lunkquist. "
"Lorna: Yeah, the whole crowd. Imagine the looks on their faces when they see us walk in together. "
"Frasier: Yes, imagine. "
"Lorna: Oh, come on, say you'll be my date. "
"Frasier: Well, I wouldn't want to let down the coach. "
"Lorna: Yeah, a spoon'd be nice "
"Lorna: Oh, everyone's inside already, we're a little late. "
"Frasier: I guess we'll just have to make a grand entrance, after you. "
"Lorna: I just have to check my makeup. "
"Frasier: Well, why tamper with perfection? "
"Lorna: Oh, aren't you sweet? "
"Frasier: Shall we? "
"Lorna: Hello? What now? What? What? [hits phone then to "
"Frasier:] My phone's playing up, I'm sorry, just two seconds, sweetie. "
"Lorna: No, you can't have a party Because I said so. Put your brother on Put your brother on Put your brother on- just a second, sweetie- -the phone You know, do what you want, I'm on a date "
"Frasier: Are you ready? "
"Lorna: Ooop, you know what, this hook keeps coming undone. [Frasier fastens the back of her dress] "
"Frasier: You know, I just took a look inside there. Everybody's here, even old Mr. 'Most-Likely-To-Succeed,' Chip Clayton. "
"Lorna: Chip Clayton's a moron "
"Frasier: Well, you used to be rather fond of him back in school. "
"Lorna: Well, everybody's changed since high school. Except you. Truly, you're still the same sweet, decent guy you always were. "
"Frasier: Thank you. "
"Lorna: No I mean it, believe me, I've been with enough jerks and users to know the difference. Let's go. "
"Frasier: Lorna, I can't go in there with you. "
"Lorna: Why not? "
"Frasier: Well, because I came here for the wrong "
"reasons: so all the cool kids would see me with school's most popular girl and I let you believe that we had hopes for some sort of a future when I know in my heart that there is none. Well, if you walk in there with me it would be as my trophy and I just can't do that to you, I'm so sorry. "
"Lorna: You expect me to walk into a room full of my ex-classmates by myself? Like some pathetic divorcée who couldn't scare up a date for some old jock sendoff? I don't think so "
"Frasier: Lorna... "
"Lorna: You know, I thought you'd be a nice rebound fling, get my feet wet dating again. You don't want that, that's fine. But I'll tell you what we are going to "
"do: You're going to take my arm, you're going to escort me in that room, we're going to dance, make out like freshmen and leave with your hand on my ass, you got it? "
"Frasier: Shall we? "

"Roz: Hey, Martin. Happy Valentine's Day. "
"Martin: Oh thanks, Roz. So you're with us tonight, huh? "
"Roz: Yeah, we rented a couple of sad chick movies. "
"Martin: Oh, it's not like you not to have a date on Valentine's Day. "
"Roz: Tell me, I usually try for a second seating "
"Daphne: And you'd think that being engaged, I'd have a guaranteed date. But no Donny had to go to Florida, his grandmother. She'd do anything to come between us. "
"Martin: Oh, what did she do this time? "
"Daphne: She died. "
"Frasier: Good Lord, where is Niles? I don't want to be late for the opera. "
"Roz: Are you going out with Niles on Valentine's Day? "
"Frasier: Well, it's a subscription series, you see. We got these tickets months ago, we had no idea what day this fell on. "
"Daphne: So Dr. Crane's not spending tonight with Mel? "
"Frasier: No, she's going out of town, some sort of medical conference. You know, actually I'm sorry for Niles, but I'm rather glad to be having an old-fashioned boy's night out. "
"Niles: I can't wait either, I'll see you in twenty minutes, Valentine. "
"Frasier: That had better be the seat duster in our opera box "
"Niles: No, it was Mel. At the last minute she decided to skip her conference. "
"Frasier: So, I'll be going to the opera by myself? "
"Niles: Oh, well here's a thought. If you give Mel your opera ticket then you won't have to be alone. You can stay here and watch fun movies with Roz and Daphne. Ooh, 'Dying Young' - it's a... classic. "
"Frasier: I am surprised by your gall At the last moment you not only bail on me, you expect me to give up my own ticket "
"Niles: Please, Frasier, put yourself in my shoes. I have to do something for Mel. Every restaurant in town's been booked for weeks. I ran into Archie Wilfong today. He told me he had to settle for two seats at the counter at 'The Salad Experience' What would you suggest I do? "
"Frasier: Bring your own wine and order the Spicy Caesar "
"Niles: May your opera box be full of cellophane crinklers and the stage swarming with standbys. "
"Frasier: Get out "
"Frasier: He goes too far "
"Roz: Yeah, some nerve - ditching you to spend Valentine's Day with his girlfriend. "
"Martin: Look, Fras, I don't blame you for being a little jealous cause he's got someone and you don't... "
"Frasier: I am not jealous, Dad, I'm simply appalled by his rudeness. I was looking forward to this evening. [pouring himself a sherry] Nice drink, lovely opera. Then a late supper, perhaps a beautiful bottle of wine, delightful desert soufflé... Oh God, I need a woman. "
"Daphne: Remember my friend Rowena? She's much prettier since her surgery You look at her face and you can't even tell where it used to be. "
"Frasier: Thank you, Daphne. But actually, I already have someone in mind. You see, there's a stunning woman who comes to the opera on the same nights we do. She has the box right across from ours. We've flirted a bit from a distance. I have laughed with her during 'Figaro,' cried with her during 'Tosca,' I even had a dream about her during 'Einstein On The Beach.' "
"Roz: Well, don't just stare at her, make a move "
"Frasier: I will, Roz. Tonight's the night. By the finalé I will have made my overture. Dad, would you please come with me? "
"Martin: To the opera? What do you need me for? "
"Frasier: Dad, I can't go with a woman because then she'll think I'm on a date, and if I go alone she'll think I couldn't get a date. "
"Roz: He would look pretty pathetic. "
"Martin: Oh, geez "
"Daphne: Or you could stay home with us and watch sad movies. "
"Frasier: 'Sophie's Choice.' "
"Martin: I'll say it is "
"Martin: Is she here yet? "
"Frasier: No, not yet. That's her box over there, the empty one. "
"Martin: Well, I'm not going to sit through a whole opera for some woman who's not even here. "
"Frasier: Oh, for God's sake, Dad, give it a chance. You might actually learn to like it if you’d listen to one. "
"Martin: Hey, your mother dragged to me a lot of these things when we were dating and they were all stupid. These stories make no sense whatsoever. "
"Frasier: Oh, that is not true "
"Martin: Oh, all right, what's this one about? "
"Frasier: Well, it's about Rigoletto, the hunchbacked jester in the court of the Duke. He has a daughter, Gilda, who's secretly living with him. But everyone thinks that she's his mistress. In this opening scene, Rigoletto mocks the Duke's enemy, who puts a curse on him. "
"Martin: A cursed hunchback dating his daughter - well, nothing screwy so far "
"Frasier: He is not dating his daughter Gilda is being courted by the Duke, who is disguised as a humble student. "
"Martin: You see, that's what I mean. The whole thing's so unrealistic. Everybody's in love, pretending to be somebody they're not. And they're all swooning and gasping- "
"Martin: Exactly, who acts that way? "
"Frasier: Dad, she's here She's here, and she's not on a date. That must be her mother. "
"Martin: Wow, you're right, she is a looker all right. "
"Frasier: All right, don't gawk, don't gawk, she'll notice. "
"Martin: Well, I thought that was the point. You've got to get her attention. "
"Frasier: No, Dad, please, don't wave Just keep your eye on the stage. "
"Martin: All right, but I bet you that gets results. "
"Frasier: You're right, Dad, it did. "
"Martin: Oh God, I wasn't waving at her, I was waving at the daughter "
"Frasier: That's not what the mother seems to think. I think she likes you, wave back. "
"Martin: No, I don't want to. "
"Frasier: Wave back You started it, wave back to her. "
"Martin: Oh, geez "
"TO: "
"Martin: Hunchback's got kind of a nice voice, but the daughter's kinda screechy "
"Frasier: Yes, well, she's no Renata Tebaldi. Gosh, I don't see them, do you? "
"Martin: Oh, I bet you the old one's in the ladies room putting on more war paint "
"Frasier: Here they are. Just try to be nice, Dad If you are rude to the mother you will ruin my chances with the daughter [they come over] Well, we finally meet. "
"Emily: I feel like we're practically old friends. "
"Helen: I'm Helen Browning, this is my daughter, Emily. "
"Frasier: I'm Frasier Crane, this is my father, Martin. "
"Frasier: Well, can we get you some champagne? "
"Emily: Oh, we'd love it, thanks. "
"Martin: Oh well, let me give you a hand. "
"Frasier: No, no, you know what, Dad, we can manage. Er, why don't you two stay and have a nice little chat? "
"Helen: Lovely production, isn't it? I adore Verdi. "
"Martin: Oh, he's my favorite. "
"Helen: Though the woman singing Gilda's a bit off. "
"Martin: She's no Renata Tebaldi. "
"Helen: You know, if you like Verdi so much, I happen to have a spare ticket to 'Aida' next week. "
"Martin: Oh, that sounds great, but, er, if it's a week from tonight, I'm busy, I'm sorry. "
"Helen: Actually, it's next Thursday. "
"Martin: Oh, Thursday? Oh, you know there's this thing at my... at my wine club. "
"Helen: That's all right, Martin, we just met, I shouldn't have asked. "
"Martin: No, no, no, Helen, it's got nothing to do with you, it's me. I'm afraid I've given you the wrong impression of myself. You see, the truth is, I'm... "
"Helen: Gay. "
"Martin: Uh, right, gay. "
"Helen: I thought you might be. How many straight men remember Renata Tebaldi? "
"Martin: "
"Helen: Well, I'm sorry if I was too forward, it's just that sometimes it's so hard to meet nice men. "
"Martin: Tell me "
"Frasier: Here we are, Dad. Actually, good news, Emily has agreed to join me for a night cap after the opera. Cast her eye over my African art collection. "
"Frasier: Oh, well... "
"Helen: Very nice meeting you. "
"Martin: Nice meeting you, too. "
"Frasier: I'll see you later. "
"Frasier: So how did it go with Helen? You didn't offend her, did you? "
"Martin: No, not at all. It turns out I'm not her type. "
"Emily: Well? "
"Helen: Opera Queen. "
"Emily: Oh, sorry. "
"Helen: Still, you know who he'd be perfect for? "
"Emily: Yes You know, he's here tonight I'll bring him. "
"Frasier: Right, Dad, we better hurry up. Don't want to miss the second act. "
"Martin: Oh, who cares? It'll be just more goofy stuff that never happens in real life. "
"Daphne: How was the opera? "
"Frasier: Lovely. Get out "
"Roz: Hey, that movie's not over. "
"Frasier: Too bad, Roz. There's a stunning woman on her way over here, I don't want her thinking I'm running some sort of maudlin sorority house. Now, come on, shake a leg. "
"Roz: You actually spoke to her, you didn't wimp out? "
"Frasier: You have never seen me so suave. "
"Roz: Some Valentine's Day First my date bails on me and now I owe Daphne fifty bucks "
"Martin: Well, hello there. Will you be my 'Ballantine'? "
"Frasier: Dad, will you go get a glass, please? "
"Martin: Oh, all right. "
"Frasier: And drink it quickly. The last thing I need tonight is some third wheel cramping my style. "
"Edward: Hello "
"Frasier: Hello. "
"Emily: I hope you don't mind. Edward here was at the opera too, he's my partner. "
"Frasier: Your partner? "
"Edward: At the gallery. I'm also her uncle. "
"Frasier: Oh, when you said partner, I thought you meant romantic partner. "
"Edward: Hardly "
"Frasier: I'm Frasier. "
"Edward: May I? "
"Frasier: Yes, please. "
"Emily: Your father, is he dating anyone at the moment? "
"Frasier: Well, no, but if you're thinking about your mother, I'm afraid they're not really right for each other. "
"Emily: Yes, I know. I meant Edward. "
"Frasier: Your uncle? "
"Emily: Yes. "
"Frasier: ...and my father? "
"Emily: They're both single, they love opera and they were both married with kids when they came out of the closet. Your dad told my mother all about it. "
"Frasier: Oh, did he? "
"Emily: Well, she asked him out and he had to be honest with her. "
"Martin: Hi, there. "
"Frasier: Yes, nothing like a little honesty to diffuse an awkward situation. "
"Martin: Hi there, how are you? "
"Frasier: Let me take your coat. Dad, this is Edward, Emily's uncle, he's her partner in her art gallery. Er, Edward, this is my father, Martin. "
"Edward: Pleased to meet you, Martin. "
"Martin: Same here, and my friends call me Marty. "
"Edward: Then Marty it is I love what you've done with this place, it's the perfect blend of sleek elegance and [pointedly at chair] audacious whimsy "
"Martin: Oh, you like it, huh? Do you know, Edward's my favorite name. "
"Edward: Really? "
"Martin: Yes, I even called my dog Eddie. Eddie [Eddie rushes in] Here he is. "
"Emily: Oh, a Jack Russell He loves Jack Russells. "
"Edward: I have three of them. All girls. "
"Martin: Oh, well, we ought to get them together. Who knows, maybe a little romance'll bloom. "
"Frasier: You know, Dad, maybe we should go fetch our new friends some drinks. "
"Emily: I'd love some white wine. "
"Martin: How about you, Ed? "
"Edward: Why not a beer? "
"Martin: Oh, a man after my own heart. "
"to: Kitchen "
"Frasier: Boy, you are really something "
"Martin: What? "
"Frasier: You actually told Emily's mother that you were gay. "
"Martin: Well, you said not to offend her, I thought that was a pretty good way to get her to cool her jets without hurting her feelings. "
"Frasier: Dad, there's something you don't understand. You see, she told Emily. "
"Martin: She got a problem with it? "
"Frasier: Oh no, she's pretty okay with it. "
"Martin: Oh, I get it, you're worried she'll know I'm straight, find out I've been lying to her mother. "
"Frasier: Dad... "
"Martin: Well, don't worry about it, I'll gay it up a little. "
"to: Living Room "
"Martin: Emily, have I told you I love your hair. "
"Emily: Thank you, Martin. "
"Martin: It's di-vine. "
"Emily: Frasier, these pieces are wonderful, you've exquisite taste "
"Martin: Oh, he gets that from me. Yes, it was worth all the hours I dragged him around to the museums and the antiques shops teaching him about art and, you know... upholstery. "
"Edward: Were you in the arts? "
"Martin: Oh, well, actually, Ed- "
"Frasier: Dad was a cop. "
"Edward: Really? "
"Martin: Yeah, in fact, er, that's what happened to my hip. I took a bullet trying to break up a robbery. Yeah, I called for back-up but it never showed up. "
"Emily: Because you were gay. "
"Martin: Don't think I didn't wonder about that "
"Martin: Yes, that was the day I came out. Lying in that alley, covered with blood, bullet in my hip and I said, 'That's it I'm gay, I like myself and I'm not living a lie anymore.' "
"Edward: I had exactly the same experience when I came out. "
"Edward: Not, exactly, perhaps. Yours was a bullet in the hip. For me, it was a Lufthansa steward named Gunther. "
"Emily: What did I tell you? I knew they'd hit it off. "
"Frasier: Yes, I had a feeling myself. "
"Martin: And you didn't say a word, you scamp Er, Frasier, why don't you come help me get some snacks for everybody? "
"Frasier: All right, if you'll excuse us. "
"to: Kitchen "
"Martin: You didn't tell me this was a set-up "
"Frasier: Well, how blind can you be, Dad? He didn't seem gay to you? "
"Martin: He's English, they all seem gay. "
"Frasier: Lord "
"Martin: Well, we're just going to have to tell him the truth. "
"Frasier: Oh, what? You found her mother so unattractive you pretended to be gay? Dad, Emily is the most fabulous woman I have met in ages. If you screw this up for me, I will never forgive you, so just be nice, all right? "
"Martin: But what if he asks me for a date? "
"Frasier: I have news for "
"you: You're on a date "
"to: Living Room "
"Frasier: Daphne "
"Edward: We've just been chatting with your delightful physical therapist, Marty. "
"Daphne: Oh, he's a charmer, this one. [Edward laughs modestly; to Martin] Now, aren't you glad you went to the opera? I keep telling him he should get out more, meet people. Most nights he just sits here alone watching the telly. "
"Emily: He's the exact same way. He'll watch anything. "
"Daphne: With him it's mostly sports. Just give him a bunch of sweaty men chasing each other around the field and he... "
"Frasier: Daphne Where are we keeping the Camembert these days? "
"Daphne: Same place we always do. "
"Frasier: Get in the kitchen "
"Emily: You were smart to hire a woman for physical therapy. Much safer than a man. Edward sprained his leg last year. "
"Edward: All right, Emily. "
"Emily: I never trusted that man. "
"Edward: All right, Emily. "
"Emily: And why you loaned him your boat... "
"Edward: All right, Emily "
"Frasier: Here we are. "
"Emily: Thank you, Frasier. I would love to see the rest of the apartment, if it's no trouble. "
"Frasier: Why, that's no trouble at all. "
"Martin: Frasier, can I just... "
"Frasier: Now, Dad, don't worry. I will close the door to your room. You should see it whenever he gets ready for the opera - clothes everywhere "
"Daphne: Well, I'm off to bed. "
"Martin: Oh, no, no, no, Daph. Daphne, why don't you join us? "
"Daphne: Oh, no, "
"no: Three's a crowd "
"Edward: So. "
"Martin: So... "
"Edward: Our loved ones seem determined to thrust us together. "
"Martin: Well, don't let them pressure you. "
"Edward: Congratulations, Marty, on having raised such a splendid son. I envy you your bond. "
"Martin: Do you have kids? "
"Edward: Just one, George. He's thirty-five and he has consecrated his life to bowling. I join him when I can, but... "
"Martin: You're not wild about it. "
"Edward: No. I mean, oh, the shoes Strange isn't it, the things we'll do to be close to our children. "
"Martin: Oh, yeah. I've let Frasier drag me to all kinds of places I didn't want to go to, just so that I could spend some time with him. You know, sometimes it's hard to humor your kids but... "
"Edward: It's what we do, we're fathers. "
"Martin: Exactly. "
"Edward: Marty, would you be free for dinner sometime? "
"Martin: Oh, gee, I, er... "
"Edward: No, it's all right, never mind. "
"Martin: No, no, no, I'd love to, it's just that... "
"Edward: No need to explain. "
"Martin: No, no, really. It's not you, you're a great guy, it's just that I'm... dating someone "
"Edward: Marty, you don't have to spare my feelings. "
"Martin: No, no, really, it's true. "
"Niles: Hello. "
"Martin: Darling "
"Niles: I'm sorry, am I interrupting something? "
"Martin: Oh, not a thing, honey. Just take off your coat and stay a while. "
"Niles: Okay. I felt bad about that squabble earlier so I dropped off this little peace offering. "
"Martin: As if I could stay mad at you. Er, this is my boyfriend, Niles. Niles, this is Edward, we met at the opera tonight. "
"Edward: Delighted. "
"Niles: Hello. "
"Edward: You needn't look so startled. I can assure you, there's nothing funny going on. "
"Niles: Oh, good. "
"Martin: Well, why don't we go put this on ice? "
"Frasier: Of course the finest Gilda ever sung was by the great Mathilde DeCagny. I actually have a recording. "
"Emily: I'd love to hear it. "
"Frasier: Where's Dad? "
"Edward: He's in the kitchen with his boyfriend. "
"Frasier: Oh Niles, what brings you here? "
"Martin: Well, it's my place too I can have company if I want. Emily, this is Niles. "
"Emily: Hello. "
"Niles: Hi. "
"Emily: Em, I didn't realize your father was seeing someone. "
"Frasier: No, actually, I didn't think he was. Since when were you two an item? "
"Martin: Two weeks now. We didn't say anything about it, yet, because, well... "
"Niles: So many reasons. "
"Edward: You know, it's getting late, Emily. "
"Emily: Oh yes, we should be going. "
"Frasier: No, no, please, please, stay for just five more minutes. I have a very special old port that I'd love for you to sample. "
"to: Kitchen "
"Frasier: How can you do this to me? "
"Niles: This was not my idea "
"Frasier: Niles, Emily just kissed me in the bedroom and now she's leaving. I have never been so embarrassed in my life. "
"Niles: You're embarrassed? They think the best I can do is an old man with a cane "
"Frasier: You've got to fix this "
"Niles: Oh, and how am I supposed to do that? "
"Frasier: Well, isn't it obvious? You've got to dump Dad "
"Frasier: Here you are. Really, you must try this. So, Niles, actually, you missed a splendid evening at the opera. "
"Niles: Well, maybe I can catch it this weekend with Mel. "
"Martin: Oh, and who's Mel? "
"Niles: Damn you and your jealous questions, you don't own me "
"Martin: Niles, I was only asking "
"Niles: You're always asking, badgering, spying on me Well, I won't be suffocated anymore. I'm tired of being your trophy boy It's over, you hear me? Over And I'm keeping the jewelry "
"Frasier: Oh, Dad, I'm so sorry. "
"Emily: If there's anything we can do... "
"Martin: No, I'll be all right, I... I guess I always knew it wouldn't last. "
"Edward: Marty, the young ones never stay. "
"Emily: I know what will cheer you up, that 'Rigoletto' recording. "
"Frasier: Oh yes, splendid. "
"Edward: You know, Emily, I'd love to hear it but that shipment is arriving bright and early. "
"Emily: Oh, right. Frasier, I wish I could stay, but I'm Edward's ride. "
"Frasier: Yes, what a shame. Well, I guess this is good night, then- "
"Martin: No, no, wait a minute. Emily, em, why don't you just stay here with Frasier and enjoy the music. [gets his coat] I'll give Edward a ride home. "
"Frasier: You would do that, Dad? "
"Martin: Happy Valentine's Day, son. "
"Frasier: Thanks, Dad. "
"Martin: All right, good night. "
"Emily: It was so sweet of your father to do that. He really loves you, doesn't he? "
"Frasier: You have no idea. "

"Roz: Why did I ever decide to redecorate my bathroom? They give you about a thousand decisions to make. After a while, you can't even tell the colors apart. "
"Frasier: Oh, Roz, perhaps my discerning decorative eye can be of some assistance, let me see here. "
"Frasier: This one's Ecruel, that's Eggshell and this of course is Nolove White. "
"Roz: Very good, Frasier. Now let's see how you do on the color side. "
"Frasier: You know, Roz, I do hope you don't spend your entire vacation redecorating. You know, you should get out, you know, have some fun, maybe even take a cruise? You don't want to stay in your apartment cooped up with a bunch of sweaty workmen. "
"Frasier: Bon Voyage. "
"Roz: Thank you, and don't worry, Chuck Ranberg said he'd take over for the week- "
"Frasier: No, no, absolutely not, Roz The man's speech impediment will make me giggle all week long. "
"Roz: Show a little compassion "
"Frasier: Oh come on, you try dealing with a call screener who says, 'Doctaw Cwane, we have a kweptomaniac on wine fwee.' "
"Roz: Well, who do you want to use? "
"Frasier: Well, actually, I was thinking of reaching out to the community. You know, I was guest speaker last month at a program called 'Second Start.' They offer career training for people who are stuck in tedious, low-paying jobs. And, em, well, I'd thought I'd give the job to one of those students. "
"Roz: That's a great idea, Frasier. Sounds like a great program. "
"Frasier: Oh dear, there's Chuck Ranberg. Roz, you've got to tell him he doesn't have the job. "
"Roz: Why can't you tell him? "
"Frasier: I'm sorry, I can't hear the man speak without just descending into giggles. "
"Roz: Oh, you are such a child "
"Frasier: "
"Chuck: Hi, guys. "
"Roz: Hey, Chuck, how's it going? "
"Chuck: Oh, tewwible, Woz My wife was in the Cawwibean and she weft me for a Wastafawian "
"TO: "
"TO: The Studio. "
"Frasier: We only have a couple of minutes before the show, so listen, tell me a little bit about yourself. How did you get interested in broadcasting? "
"Mary: Well, after I got laid off from the bakery, I guess I had some free time. So I took a few different night school courses and when I got to the one in radio, it all clicked. "
"Frasier: Oh, well, isn't that funny? You know, I had almost exactly the same experience. I first discovered psychiatry in Dr. Badgley's epidemiology seminar at Harvard. "
"Mary: Except I bet you didn't walk though a metal detector to get to class "
"Frasier: No, no, but, you know, I did have to pass under a dangerously unbalanced portrait of Alfred Adler in the Rotunda "
"Mary: We are practically separated at birth "
"Frasier: Ten seconds, Mary, coming up. "
"Mary: Oh, I'm so nervous. "
"Frasier: Oh, you'll be fine, just relax. "
"Mary: Okay. "
"Frasier: Hello, Seattle. This is Dr. Frasier Crane and I'm listening. I'd like to take this opportunity to introduce someone who's going to bring her own flavor to the show this week while Roz is gone. Say hello to Mary Thomas. [Mary nods; encouraging her to talk] It's great to have you with us, Mary. You know, we want to get right to your calls, folks. So, we'll be right back after this. "
"Frasier: Mary, I should mention that you should feel free to speak on the air. You know, Roz often chimes in from time to time. "
"Mary: Oh, I can't believe I messed up so quickly. "
"Frasier: Oh, no, no, no, not at all, not at all. Just promise me that you'll speak up when it feels right. "
"Mary: I will "
"Frasier: Okay, great, I'm sure you have excellent instincts. "
"Mary: Five seconds. "
"Frasier: Right. "
"Frasier: And we're back. All right, Mary, who's our first caller? "
"Mary: Er, she's thirty-six years old... married five years... and her husband's been staying late at the office so he can meet with his secretary. "
"Frasier: I mean, I'm sorry, Maria, em, I'm Listening. "
"Maria: Hi, Dr. Crane. Anyway, he's having an affair and it's not his first. This has been going on since we were newlyweds. How do I get him to change? "
"Frasier: Well, Maria. You of course know it's impossible to force anyone to change. But you can work to change yourself. Usually women that tolerate this sort of behavior from their husbands are suffering from low self-esteem issues, you may need some counseling to resolve those issues. Let me ask you a couple of questions... "
"Mary: May I say something? "
"Frasier: Yes. "
"Mary: Maria, Dr. Crane is right. You must make a change. And the first thing you change is the lock on your front door. "
"Frasier: What? "
"Maria: Oh, listen, there's plenty of time for counselors, but at six o'clock locksmiths start charging extra, so you get on it, girlfriend. You know, my Grampa Willie used to say, 'Nothing stops a man from playing the field faster than a night out on the lawn.' Okay? Okay "
"Frasier: Oh, thank you, Grampa Willie "
"TO: "
"Mary: Looky here, Tony. You're thirty-five years old. Now, your parents only had you for the first eighteen, so if you want to start blaming someone, maybe you need to blame yourself. Okay? Okay "
"Frasier: Actually, chronic rage problems usually stem from childhood... "
"Mary: All right, Dr. Crane, we're all out of time. "
"Frasier: So we are. Well then, this is Dr. Frasier Crane, saying goodbye Seattle, and good mental health. [goes to press button] "
"Mary: And tune in tomorrow "
"TO: "
"Niles: Hello, Daphne. "
"Daphne: Oh, Dr. Crane, you're in a good mood today. "
"Niles: Hmm-mm, after six long weeks I have finally received my yellow belt. "
"Daphne: Oh, aren't you lucky? I ordered some more Capri pants two months ago and I'm still waiting. "
"Niles: No, no, no. As this handsome certificate will attest, I've finally attained the second level of kickboxing. "
"Daphne: Oh, congratulations. What made you take up kickboxing? "
"Niles: Well, in order to protect Mel. Er, as you know, she's a plastic surgeon. She has a habit of slipping her card to total strangers who she feels could use her services. So far no harm done, but... "
"Daphne: But it's only a matter of time before you get your lights punched out? "
"Niles: Exactly. It almost happened last week with Marjorie Dunsmore. Luck was on our side, but next time there might not be a walker to kick over, so... I think Dad'll be properly impressed when I demonstrate my precision in footwork. "
"Daphne: Oh It's very impressive, Dr. Crane. You know, I just remembered the Chihuly needs a good dusting. "
"Frasier: Daphne, I thought you cleaned that yesterday? "
"Daphne: Oh, did I? "
"Frasier: Oh, hello, Niles. What brings you here? "
"Niles: Here to demonstrate my newly acquired feet [high kicks shouting 'hu-ho'] of fury "
"Frasier: Carry on, Daphne. [pours a sherry as Daphne exits to the kitchen and Martin enters and sits in his chair] "
"Niles: Frasier, Frasier, who was that woman on your show today? "
"Frasier: Oh, that was Mary Thomas, she's filling in for Roz this week. "
"Martin: It seemed to me like she was filling for you "
"Niles: You're normally so particular about what happens on your show. I'm surprised you let her go on like that. "
"Frasier: Well, I started to say something and then I thought, well, it might be a bit condescending. "
"Martin: I know why you didn't say anything; cause she's black "
"Frasier: Oh, that's ridiculous, Dad, race has nothing to do with it. "
"Niles: Oh, come now, Frasier. You can't deny a certain measure of guilt, living as you do in your exclusive lily-white world. "
"Frasier: Niles, owning the CD of 'Ella sings Gershwin' does not qualify you as a soul brother "
"Martin: You know, Frasier, there's such a thing as being too sensitive about this stuff. Now if it was Roz blabbing on instead of this Mary, you'd tell her to put a sock in it, right? "
"Frasier: Well, I suppose so, but, you know, this is different, Dad. She's just starting out, I didn't want to squelch her enthusiasm. "
"Martin: Because she's black. "
"Frasier: Dad, please, will you just stop saying that? Anyway, I will just have to deal with it for a week until Roz gets back. "
"Martin: Black "
"Frasier: Stop it "
"Niles: My first roommate at Yale was black "
"Frasier: Huntington Treadwell III It's hardly representative of the African-American experience, Niles. "
"Niles: His father was a pioneer in Selma and Montgomery. "
"Frasier: Yes, I believe he built golf courses all over the South "
"Niles: Oh, speaking of golf, dad, I've become quite the sportsman myself. What do you think of that? "
"Martin: Oh, it's very nice, son, but calligraphy really isn't a sport More of a craft. "
"Niles: No, no, no, this is for kickboxing, I finally reached yellow belt, Dad. "
"Martin: He-hey, what do you know? I'm proud of ya "
"Martin: No, come here. "
"Niles: You know, it requires a lot of talent. You have to have timing and balance, the ability to strike and instantly retreat. "
"Martin: So you kick them and then run away? "
"Niles: Yes. My instructor says I'm a natural. Can I show you something? "
"Martin: Yeah, sure. "
"Niles: I'll show you a roundhouse kick, all right? "
"Niles: You sense your assailant's presence. You feel your body in the space. Know where your opponent is and when you're ready... you strike "
"Niles: What have I done? "
"Martin: Are you all right, Daphne? "
"Daphne: Yes. "
"Niles: Really? "
"Daphne: No. I landed on my wrist, it's really throbbing... "
"Martin: Go get her some ice, Niles "
"menagerie: "
"Frasier: You know, Dad, perhaps you're right. Maybe I am too sensitive. Daphne, could you get that, please? "
"Frasier: Gabe, you must remember that compulsive shopping is an addiction. There are no simple solutions. "
"Mary: Oh, I've got one Cut those credit cards up right now. Okay? Okay "
"Gabe: Thank you, Dr. Mary. "
"Frasier: You know, I hate to be a stickler here, Gabe, but as Mary would be the first to point "
"out: she is not a doctor. "
"Mary: Oh, I don't mind. Call me Dr. Mary. You know, Latifa's not a real Queen, right? "
"Mary: Oh, you know what, doll babies, we're all out of time for today. "
"Frasier: So we are. Well then, this is Dr. Frasier Crane... "
"Mary: ...and Dr. Mary "
"Frasier: Saying goodbye Seattle and... good mental health. "
"Kenny: Hey, guys. Just checking in to see how things are going. "
"Mary: Are you kidding, it's a dream come true. "
"Kenny: So, er, you and Mary, what do you think of her? Be honest. "
"Frasier: Well, I genuinely like her, she's delightful and dedicated. "
"Kenny: And...? "
"Frasier: Well, em, she does have a tendency to just sort of jump right in there whenever she likes, you know, and frankly, her method of solving problems is totally different than mine. [laughs to cover fear of prejudice] "
"Kenny: The contrast between you guys, that's what gets things crackling. I always thought that your show was the gold standard of radio shrink chatter. But this last week has been even better "
"Frasier: You think so? "
"Kenny: Absolutely In fact, the boys upstairs would like to make you two a permanent team. Oh, who am I kidding? There are no boys upstairs, I just love this show Okay? "
"Mary: Oh, this is so exciting, I cannot believe it. "
"Frasier: Oh, me neither "
"Kenny: And don't you worry about Roz. I'm just going to switch her over to Gil's show. The hours are better and I'll even throw in a twenty percent raise Ah, this is going be great I bet within a month you guys are going to have the hottest ratings in Seattle "
"Mary: Oh, this is so wonderful, thank you both, really. I'm going to go call my parents. "
"Frasier: Listen, Kenny... "
"Kenny: I know what you're feeling right now, Doc, and let me save you the trouble. Come here, big guy "
"Mary: I want some too "
"TO: the streets of Seattle again. This time the tram has a "
"TO: "
"Niles: Everything comfy, Daphne? There you are. This quiche should hold you 'til dinner. "
"Daphne: Dr. Crane, you really don't need to fill in for me, it's just a sprained wrist. I'm perfectly capable of cooking dinner. "
"Martin: The hell you are "
"Niles: Daphne, it is the least I can do, believe me. Until you're fully recovered, consider me your full-time stand-in. Oh, which reminds me, Dad. I rented your favorite video. [hands it to him] "
"Martin: Oh-ho, 'Death Wish.' "
"Niles: Oh, I'll get your beer, I'm just frosting the mug in the freezer the way Daphne does. "
"Daphne: I never frost your beer mug "
"Martin: Oh, be quiet, will you? He's feeling very guilty and we have to help him work through it. "
"Daphne: That is just baloney, and you know it. Shame on you, taking advantage of your son, I don't know how you sleep at night "
"Martin: Well, pretty good since he started putting a mint on my pillow and a cup of cocoa by the bed. "
"Daphne: He never leaves me cocoa. "
"Martin: You have to fill out that little card. "
"Daphne: Oh. "
"Martin: Oh, Fras, how did the show go? "
"Frasier: It was very educational. Today, Mary taught us how to manipulate our husbands... by withholding sex. And she taught us how to lie to our children about the past. "
"Martin: Boy, that Dr. Mary sure goes on and on. "
"Frasier: For the last time - she is not a doctor, no matter how many times she refers to herself as one. 'A cat can have kittens in the oven but that don't make 'em biscuits' Dear God, now I'm quoting Grampa Willie "
"Niles: For heaven's sake, Frasier, why don't you just talk to her? "
"Frasier: Well, it's a delicate situation, Niles. For God's sake, it's not all that easy. I mean, she is new to the field, she's sensitive, she's eager to please... "
"Martin: She's black "
"Frasier: Dad, please "
"Martin: Well, you know damn well that's what this whole thing's about. I don't know what the big deal is, if she's talking too much, just tell her to shut her big bazoo. "
"Frasier: Oh, really? How do you suggest I accomplish that without sounding like a complete bigot? "
"Niles: Well, perhaps a little diplomacy is in order. "
"Frasier: Oh, are you saying I should just choose my words more carefully, is that it? "
"Niles: Yes, exactly. "
"Frasier: Fine, fine, all right, Niles. Just exactly how would that go? Why don't you play me and I'll be Mary. "
"Niles: All right. Er, Mary? "
"Frasier: Frasier "
"Niles: I've been meaning to speak to you. You know, people listen to the show for my expertise. "
"Frasier: Oh, so my opinion's not worth anything? "
"Niles: Well, I'm the one with the medical degree. Now I want you to contribute, but only up to a point. "
"Frasier: So, you want me to stay in my place, Massa "
"Niles: She's not going to say 'Massa'... "
"Frasier: What, am I getting too uppity for you? You sherry-swelling, opera-loving, Armani-wearing elitist You have no idea how difficult it is for a black woman in a white man's world "
"Niles: Frasier... "
"Frasier: I don't think so Look at me This is ridiculous. I have walked myself straight into a mine field "
"Niles: Listen, Frasier. I know you're trying to be sensitive, but you're not showing this woman any respect if you're not as honest with her as you would be with someone else. "
"Martin: Right, this is your show. When she gets her own show she can say whatever she wants. "
"Frasier: Wait a minute You know what, Dad, you may be onto something there. Gosh, I don't know why I didn't think of that myself. You know what, I'm just going to call Kenny and tell him to give her her own show. They're looking for a replacement for 'Let's Go Camping With Dan & Jenny.' "
"Martin: What happened to them? "
"Frasier: They don't know. Kenny, it's Frasier. Listen, I've been thinking. You know what, I think I'm holding Mary back. You know, a talent like hers should not be stuck in a producer's chair. He agrees with me "
"TO: "
"Mary: Oh, I'll tell you what you do, you snap out of it. You know why you're afraid to get married? You think there's some room full of hoochy mommas out there that's waiting for you, in case you don't want to do the right thing. Let me tell you something, the only thing you're missing out on is a lot of cold and lonely nights and I tell you what, there's not one person out there that would disagree with me on that. "
"Louise: I do I don't think he deserves that girl and if he's not man enough to take that leap of faith then she's better off without him "
"Mary: Louise, is you trippin'? Girls... ' "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Hi, Roz. "
"Roz: Hey, Frasier. I listened to your show for about twenty minutes today, I didn't hear your voice. "
"Frasier: Well, I'm playing a diminished role these days. Although still an important one. I am the glue that holds the show together - or as Mary said in her intro, 'The filling in our little Oreo.' "
"Roz: Well, it's no picnic working with Gil either. You know that little joke that he makes before every show that his taste buds are insured? "
"Frasier: Mmm. "
"Roz: They really are "
"Frasier: Oh "
"Roz: Guess who had to take the claims photo after he had to eat a hot slice of pizza? "
"Frasier: Oh God, Roz, I'm so sorry. "
"Roz: You should be. I go away for a week and you give away our whole show "
"Frasier: Yes, I know. Oh, Lord, there she is. You know what, I could have nipped this whole thing in the bud if I'd just been honest with her from the beginning. You know what, perhaps the time's come for me to just tell her the truth. "
"Roz: Well, it sounds like an intense conversation. I think I'll get out of here and give you a little room. "
"Frasier: Thank you, Roz. "
"Frasier: Roz "
"Mary: Hey there, partner. Is there room for one more at the doctor's table? "
"Frasier: Of course, Mary. Listen, there is something I want to talk to you about. "
"Mary: Oh, I don't doubt it. Could you believe Louise today? She just would not stop talking, would she? "
"Frasier: Well, it's not Louise... "
"Mary: Every time I turned around she's just yappity, yappity, yappity, yap. I mean, what is her training anyway? "
"Frasier: Mary, please, just stop it, stop it. Please, the problem is not with Louise, it's with you. "
"Mary: What? "
"Frasier: Well, the truth is, I... I don't enjoy working with you. I haven't enjoyed working with you from the start. We have different styles and I have absolutely no respect for the advice that you give. "
"Mary: I... I had no idea. Well, why didn't you just say something before? "
"Frasier: And the truth is that I was afraid that if I said something critical of you, you might react the wrong way... and I feel just terrible about it. "
"Mary: Maybe you shouldn't feel so bad because... "
"Frasier: No, no, actually, I should. You see, I pride myself on being able to communicate with just about anybody, and I couldn't even be honest with you. "
"Mary: Oh, it's not that easy. You didn't want to disappoint me, I understand. If you don't like the show the way it is right now then that comes first. Like Grampa Willie used to say, 'If the shoe don't fit then that ain't your shoe.' "
"Frasier: Well, you know, as much as I've come to loathe Grampa Willie, that does actually make me feel a little better. "
"Mary: You know, I'll let you in on a little secret. All those expressions? I made them up myself. I'll give you another reason not to feel so bad about all this. Today, KPXY offered me my own show. I'm going to be just fine on my own. "
"Frasier: Mary, that's wonderful news. So, you forgive me? "
"Mary: Well, I think you could have been honest with me. Then again, if you'd told me to be quiet then I'd be back at the bakery. Instead, I've got this brand-new career and this afternoon I'm shopping for cars. So I guess what I'm saying is... God bless your guilty white ass Okay? "
"Roz: So, how'd it go? "
"Frasier: Well, actually, better than I expected. I guess we're a team again, Roz. "
"Roz: Great. Well, you'll have to wait a little while. I've got to stay with Gil at least until we find another replacement. "
"Frasier: Oh yes, of course. Well, I can find somebody. "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Thank you for your call, Jill. Well, Chuck, who else is on the line? "
"Chuck: Weww, Doctaw Cwane, we have Winda on wine fwee who bewieves peopew are waffing at hew. "
"Frasier: Maybe we can just come back to that one, shall we? "
"Chuck: All wightey "

"Clare: How's your coffee? "
"Martin: Good, good. Yours? "
"Clare: Very nice. "
"Martin: That's good. "
"Clare: Marty, we have no reason to be uncomfortable. We're two consenting adults. "
"Martin: What about your husband? He never consented "
"Clare: Stan loved you Martin, and he loved me. If anything, he's up in heaven right now, watching us and smiling. "
"Martin: You don't think he was watching the whole time, do you? "
"Clare: Not if heaven gets ESPN Now, stop feeling guilty. "
"Martin: Okay. "
"Frasier: Oh, Dad. "
"Martin: Oh, Fras'. You remember Clare Wojadubakowski? "
"Frasier: Yes, of course, hello, Mrs. Wojadubakowski, good to see you again. Gosh, I'm sorry again about your loss. "
"Clare: Thank you. "
"Frasier: He was a good man, your husband. Dad's often said if it weren't for Stan, he wouldn't have made it through the academy, isn't that right? "
"Martin: That's right. "
"Frasier: Didn't he lend you the money for your first car? "
"Martin: Yeah, he did. "
"Frasier: Oh course, we all owe him for introducing Dad to Mom. "
"Martin: Oh, God "
"Clare: You know, Marty, I think we better go. "
"Frasier: Of course, well, Clare it's lovely seeing you again. Em, please give my regards to your son, Martin. "
"Martin: Oh, God "
"Frasier: Oh hi, Roz. Why don't you join me? "
"Roz: Well, aren't you here with Niles? "
"Frasier: No, actually I haven't been seeing much of Niles lately. He spends all his time with Mel. "
"Roz: Well, that's what happens at the beginning of relationships. Can I have a decaf latte, please? "
"Frasier: Yes, and I'll have my usual, thank you. [waiter leaves] Yes, I do hope he hasn't forgotten me completely. We have wine club tonight, I'm sort of counting on him to help me become 'corkmaster.' "
"Roz: But you'll still keep your secret identity as Frasier Crane, right? "
"Frasier: Corkmaster's the most prestigious position in our club. If elected, I plan to have vertical tastings and guest speakers, perhaps even a trip to Portugal where some of the world's finest corks come from. "
"Roz: I wish I had a cork right now "
"Frasier: Very funny, Roz. You know what, I do hope Niles shows up. You know, Mel has a way of making him change his mind at the last minute. You know, I think she's a bit manipulative. "
"Roz: Based on what? "
"Frasier: Oh, I don't know, I've a feeling. "
"Roz: So you really don't know her that well. "
"Frasier: That's true. You know, I really haven't given her much of a chance, I suppose. I suppose I could put together a little get-to-know-you event, a Sunday brunch perhaps? "
"Roz: There you go. "
"Frasier: Yes, it's a good idea, Roz. Of course, I don't want to make it seem like she's under the family microscope. You know, maybe you could come along. "
"Roz: I guess I could. "
"Frasier: Great. "
"Roz: Oh, and by Sunday you'll be Corkman. "
"Frasier: Cork-MASTER, thank you, Roz. Actually, I won't know until after the election tonight. But you know, I'll let you know. "
"Roz: Or I could just look up into the sky for the cork signal "
"Frasier: Very amusing, Roz. "
"Roz: If you win, I'd love a ride in the cork-mobile. "
"Frasier: All right, Roz "
"Mel: Oh, don't you look dashing. I've brought you a nice bottle of Cheval Blanc to impress the wine club. Mrs. Briggs gave it to me as a thank-you after her last face-lift. "
"Niles: '61 I don't believe it "
"Mel: Yes, that's what they're saying about Mrs. Briggs "
"Niles: Oh, this is the perfect occasion for me to bring this wine. We're electing a new president tonight. "
"Mel: Oh? "
"Niles: Yes, and I promised Frasier I'd nominate him. Oh, did I mention, brunch at Frasier's tomorrow? "
"Mel: Oh yes, darling. Well, I'm so happy my rare, expensive bottle will benefit your brother. Oh, that tie's all wrong, let me. "
"Niles: Yes, of course, of course. "
"Niles: Yes, well, ever since the day he joined the wine club, Frasier's dreamed of becoming corkmaster. [she picks out a tie] Oh, good choice "
"Mel: I think it's wonderful. I really "
"do: helping your brother win this prestigious post. "
"Niles: Well, Frasier, deserves it. "
"Mel: Because he knows more about wine than you do? "
"Niles: I wouldn't say that. "
"Mel: Well, he's probably been in the club longer? "
"Niles: No, actually, I sponsored his membership. "
"Mel: Oh, well, so you've never wanted that honor for yourself? "
"Niles: Well, I wouldn't say never. Who hasn't nursed the dream of one day becoming corkmaster? "
"Mel: Oh, I'm sure Frasier at least asked if you were interested. "
"Niles: Now that you mention it, no he didn't. "
"Mel: Oh, and you don't resent it? Well, you see, that's why I love you, because most people would. I would, bitterly, but then I'm not you and I don't know what's best for you and... now the jacket's all wrong. "
"Niles: Do you think I should call him on this? "
"Mel: Please, the last thing I want to do is come between you and your brother. "
"Niles: He knows perfectly well how much I've coveted this post. I distinctly confided my aspirations to him the night Jud Riverton fell off the ferry after the spring tasting "
"Mel: Well, I'm sure he just forgot. "
"Niles: No, no, don't defend him. Here. He's always putting himself first and I always let him. "
"Mel: Why, Niles? "
"Niles: Oh, I don't know, I think perhaps it's because... "
"Mel: I'll tell you "
"why: because you can't see yourself for what you really are You are a powerful, sexy, dynamic, colossus of a man. In other words, perfect corkmaster. "
"Niles: I am, aren't I? "
"Mel: And don't let anyone, anyone ever take that away from you. "
"Mel: Now, that's all I want to say, because I love you and I don't want to meddle. "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Oh, Niles, finally, you're here. "
"Niles: Yes, sorry I'm late. "
"Frasier: Oh, that's all right, it's just that the nominations are about to begin. Now listen, this is what I thought we would do. After you nominate me, I will demure modestly for a moment and then I'll say something like... "
"Niles: I want to be corkmaster. "
"Frasier: Well, that's a bit artless, don't you think? "
"Niles: No, "
"no: I want to be corkmaster too. I covet this post as much as you do, I always have, and I think I deserve a shot at it. "
"Frasier: But Niles, I've been campaigning for this all week, I was counting on you to nominate me. "
"Niles: And I will, I'm just hoping that you'll return the favor. Unless that is you're afraid of a little competition. "
"Master: Can I have your attention? My friends, as outgoing corkmaster, I would like to thank those who stuck with me during the ugly days of Spritzer-gate, but the time has come to pass the tasting cup. Are there any nominations? Niles. "
"Niles: It's a honor and a privilege to nominate my brother, Frasier Crane. "
"Master: Right, any others? "
"Frasier: Yes, I would like to reciprocate and nominate my brother, Niles Crane. "
"Master: Are there any further nominations? Well then, a show of hands, please, for those in favor of Frasier Crane. [they do and he counts - including Niles's proud hand] Fourteen. And those in favor of Niles Crane? Thirteen. Oh, fourteen. It's a tie. If only out venerable founder, Virgil Hepplewhite was here to guide us. "
"Virgil: I'm over here. "
"Master: Oh, sorry, Virgil, I didn't see you. So, em, what is the procedure? "
"Virgil: Blind taste of five bottles. "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Oh for God's sake, Niles. The wine spent less time in the bottle "
"Master: All right, gentlemen, you have correctly identified the first three wines, let's see if number four can break the tie. Niles? "
"Niles: It was ripe, round and thoroughly seductive. I said Australian Shiraz. "
"Master: Ah, and Frasier, what did you think? "
"Frasier: Well, contrary to my brother I thought it was dark, dusky and supple, but I also said Australian Shiraz.' [holds up card] "
"Master: You're both right, we're still tied. "
"Frasier: Well, Niles, this is the moment of truth. Don't choke. "
"Niles: Please, prepare to be stomped like a late harvest Gevertstremener "
"Master: Gentlemen? "
"Niles: It was jammy, plummy, dense and chewy. There is no doubt in my mind that it was a Napa Valley Merlot. "
"Master: You, Frasier. "
"Frasier: A nice big wine with excellent heft. It's Napa all right, but as I always say, why go Merlot when you can call a Cab? "
"Master: I thought this bottle might trip you up. Gentlemen, it's actually a blend. A forty-five percent Cabernet... "
"Frasier: And? "
"Master: And... fifty five percent Merlot Niles wins by ten percent. "
"Frasier: Well, Niles, congratulations, obviously the better man won. "
"Niles: Frasier, please... "
"Frasier: No, Niles, don't be modest. "
"Niles: No, I wasn't, they're starting my inauguration. ' "
"Club: Hail corkmaster, The master of the cork, He knows which wine goes with fish or pork Hail corkmaster, The master of the cork... "
"Frasier: You know, the whole purpose of this brunch is to get to know Mel better, but it just hurts the hell out of me preparing a sumptuous brunch for Niles after the way he betrayed me at the wine club. "
"Roz: Oh, would you shut up about that corkmaster thing I already hate you for putting that song in my head "
"to: Living Room "
"Martin: Okay, it's all clear. "
"Martin: Thanks for dropping off my tupperware. "
"Clare: Oh, oh, it's no trouble at all. I was headed out to church this morning... and I thought, 'Oh, Marty's right on the way.' "
"Martin: What's the matter with us? "
"Clare: Oh, Martin, we have done nothing wrong. I mean, maybe we were a little impetuous, but that's no crime. "
"Martin: Yeah, I guess you're right. Well, listen, thanks for dropping by, and I'll call you. "
"Frasier: Mrs. Wojadubakowski. "
"Martin: Yeah, look who just came here Look who it is. [drags her back] "
"Frasier: I didn't even hear the doorbell ring, what brings you here? "
"Martin: Oh, she just brought me back my chili bowl. Well thanks a lot, and I'll see you later. "
"Frasier: No, Dad, where are your manners? Why don't you join us for brunch, Clare? I insist. I'm not sure that we'll be able to give you a treat as spicy as the one that Dad gave you but... "
"Clare: Yes, he does make very good chili "
"Frasier: Isn't that flattering, Dad? You know what, I think someone wants seconds "
"Martin: Frasier, could I see you in the kitchen for a minute? "
"Frasier: Yes, of course. Clare, you make yourself at home. "
"Frasier: Oh, splendid idea, Roz; Bloody Marys. You know, why don't you offer one of those to Clare? "
"Martin: Oh, I don't think she's got time. "
"Daphne: I'll ask her. "
"Daphne: Mrs. Wojadubakowski, Mr. Crane was wondering if you had time for a quick one. "
"Martin: Look, Frasier, there's something you should know about me and "
"Clare: we just slept together. "
"Frasier: Are you sure? She just got here two minutes ago. "
"Martin: She was here earlier. I just don't know what came over us. We just couldn't keep our hands off each other, we were like animals or sex-crazed teenagers. "
"Frasier: Well, what's wrong with that? "
"Martin: Well, I'll tell you what's wrong with that, she's Stan's widow. I mean, he didn't even like it when I borrowed his lawn mower "
"Frasier: Dad, listen, Stan's been gone a while now. I mean, you're not teenagers, you're two mature people reaching out for some companionship. I think it's adorable. "
"Martin: Adorable? "
"Daphne: Oh, good morning, Dr. Crane. "
"Niles: Hello, Daphne. My, isn't that a beautiful outfit. "
"Daphne: Oh, thank you, Dr. Crane, how sweet. "
"Mel: So just beep me if you need me. "
"Niles: Greetings all. Mel, I think you know everyone. "
"Niles: Oh, Mrs. Wojadubakowski, what a nice surprise. This is Mel Karnovsky. "
"Mel: Hello. "
"Clare: It's a pleasure to meet you. Martin, I really have to be getting to church. "
"Martin: Oh, yeah, sure, okay. Well, I'll just walk you out. "
"Niles: You know what, by the way, I'm so sorry to hear about your husband. "
"Clare: Thank you, thank you. "
"Niles: I understand Dad's been doing what he can to fill the void. "
"Roz: Can I pour you a Bloody Mary, Mel? "
"Mel: Not for me. It's a little early in the day for hard liquor, don't you think? "
"Roz: Not anymore. "
"Mel: Niles, let's get this foie gras box in the refrigerator. Oh, hello, Eddie. Or should I say goodbye? "
"Martin: Huh? "
"Mel: Well, Martin, I'm sure you'll be locking Eddie out on the balcony if people are going to be eating here. "
"Martin: Well, I'll tell you who I'd like to lock out on the balcony- "
"Roz: Oh please, let it be me "
"Frasier: Now, now, maybe I remind you that we're having this little bruncheon in order to get acquainted with Mel. We owe it to Niles to give her a chance. "
"Daphne: I agree with Dr. Crane, we should all have another Bloody Mary. "
"Frasier: I didn't say that "
"Daphne: It was implied. "
"Mel: Oh, Frasier, I almost forgot. The corkmaster and I brought this along for you. "
"Frasier: Oh, well, thank you very much, that's a lovely bottle. I guess Niles must have told you about his eleventh hour victory. "
"Mel: Ah, yes, and I'm so proud of him. "
"Niles: Let's give credit where credit's due, to Mel. "
"Frasier: To Mel? "
"Niles: Well, yes, it was her idea that I should run. "
"Frasier: Really? Well, perhaps I'll just put this around the corner before the cork flies out and hits someone. "
"TO: "
"Mel: So, after all these years of doing tummy tucks and liposuctions, I can look at a fully clothed person and see exactly what they look like naked. [everyone becomes self- conscious] I can see every sag, droop, ripple and pucker. It's like X-ray vision. "
"Roz: How interesting. I think I'll go check on breakfast. "
"Frasier: Let me give you a hand with that. "
"Roz: When you invited me, did you say 'brunch for Mel' or 'brunch from Hell'? "
"Frasier: That woman is unbearable. "
"Martin: Well, guess who's allergic to Eddie? "
"Frasier: Oh, Lord. "
"Martin: She wants a glass of water to take her pill with. [fills a glass] Boy, do you know what I can't stand? All that 'sweetie, dearie, darling' stuff. I've never met anyone so phony Hello, dear, here's your water. "
"Mel: Thank you, Martin. Well, Frasier, I'm afraid I have some bad news. I just got beeped by my service and I have to go. "
"Frasier: Oh gosh, I'm so sorry. "
"Mel: Thank you for brunch though, thanks for inviting me. It's such a civilized way to spend an afternoon. "
"Daphne: 'With her head tucked underneath her arm/ she walks the bloody tower' - You know who that song's about, don't you? "
"Mel: Bloody Mary? "
"Daphne: Oh, don't mind if I do "
"Mel: Anyway, I better go. "
"Niles: Darling, I have your coat. I'll walk you to the elevator. "
"Mel: Well, thank you all for a lovely afternoon. "
"Martin: Well, that's a blessing. Now we can enjoy our breakfast. "
"Roz: I doubt it. I was only allowed to make a cheese-free, mushroom-free, fat-free frittata, thanks to the girl in the plastic bubble "
"Daphne: I think I'll order a pizza. "
"Frasier: You know, I have half a mind to say something to Niles, he is making a terrible mistake with that woman "
"Martin: Frasier "
"Frasier: But Dad, it is Maris all over again She's dominating him, emasculating him "
"Martin: Look, I don't like her anymore than you do and God knows we've been through this before. I didn't Lilith, we both didn't like Maris and you boys sure as hell didn't like Sherry, but what good did it do talking about it? "
"Frasier: He's repeating a terrible pattern. "
"Martin: Well he's going to repeat it whether you like it or not. And if you say anything, you're just going to drive a wedge between you. So, nobody's going to say a word "
"Niles: Well, it's a shame Mel had to leave. "
"Frasier: Oh yeah, you know, we were having such a good time. "
"Martin: Yeah, Niles. "
"Niles: You know, I was nervous bringing her over here. "
"Niles: I was concerned what you'd think, you know, getting to really know her for the first time. So? "
"Roz: Ooh, I'm going to go let Eddie in. "
"Niles: Come on, seriously, I want you to be totally honest. [Daphne enters, waiting on the phone] Tell me, what do you think of Mel? "
"Daphne: Oh, I don't like her at all, she's bossy and fussy and mean. She's all wrong for you. Yes, I need a large pepperoni pizza, and some cheese bread "
"Martin: I'm sure she didn't mean that, Niles. [follows Daphne into kitchen] "
"Niles: Well, that was startling. "
"Frasier: Yes, well, don't take that seriously, Niles. [Roz enters from balcony] You know how women sometimes just form irrational dislikes for one another. "
"Roz: Oh, that's great, I leave the room for one second and you rat me out. "
"Frasier: No, Roz... "
"Roz: No, it's okay, I don't have anything to hide and I'm not irrational. She's pushy, demanding and a gigantic pain in the ass I'd dump her like radioactive waste. "
"Niles: Well, so that's two of you in the Anti-Mel camp. "
"Roz: Oh, did you tell him what you thought of Mel too? "
"Frasier: No, Daphne did. "
"Roz: Oops "
"Niles: Frasier? "
"Frasier: I just think she's Maris all over again, she's manipulative... I think you're repeating a terrible pattern. "
"Niles: Well, isn't this neat? We all have our individual reasons for disliking her. "
"Niles: Hey, Dad, what's your reason for disliking Mel? "
"Daphne: So you did tell him what you think of her and after shoving me into the kitchen and shaking your freakin' finger at me "
"Martin: She's crazy, Niles, I don't know what she's talking about... "
"Niles: No, no, that's all right, Dad. I, er, I asked you all to be honest and you were. I got my answer. You know what would have been nice? Is if one of you could have found one nice thing to say about her. "
"Daphne: She does have that X-ray vision. "
"Martin: Did you talk to Niles? "
"Frasier: Em, I left a couple of messages but no answer. I think he's gonna have to stay mad for a while. "
"Martin: Yeah, well, that was a hell of a brunch all the way round for you as well as me. "
"Frasier: Dad, if you're talking about what happened between you and Mrs. Wojadubakowski, you have nothing to be ashamed of. "
"Martin: Yeah, yeah, I guess. "
"Frasier: So, you're going to see her again? "
"Martin: Oh, I don't know, I don't think it's gonna work out. "
"Frasier: You're not still feeling guilty, are you? "
"Martin: No, what you said made a lot of sense. It's just that I think it's run its course. "
"Frasier: Oh, well, I have a theory. "
"Martin: Geez "
"Frasier: No, no, hear me out. I think by giving you my approval to sleep with Clare I've made it less exciting for you. There was a certain illicitness to the relationship that gave it a kind of piquancy. "
"Martin: Frasier, it's Sunday, take the day off "
"Daphne: Wait, Mr. Crane. You slept with Mrs. Wojadubakowski? "
"Martin: Yes, I did, isn't that adorable? "
"Daphne: No, it's disgusting, you dirty old man Sleeping with that poor widow before her husband's even cold in the ground. "
"Martin: You think that was wrong? "
"Daphne: You're damn right I do. You ought to be ashamed. "
"Martin: See, I told you, Frasier. "
"Daphne: We live in a civilized society and there are certain rules we have to live by. [getting carried away as if settling a mental conflict] We all have impulses we'd like to explore, but we don't "
"Frasier: Daphne? "
"Daphne: Well, we can't just go chasing anyone you fancy just because you're suddenly attracted to them. There are certain things you don't do, no matter how tempted you are. "
"Frasier: Boy that was strange, wasn't it? "
"Martin: I don't think it was strange at all Made a lot of sense to me "
"Frasier: Where the hell are you going? "
"Martin: Well, I better get over to Clare's and apologize. Don't wait up for me Frasier, I've got a lot of apologizing to do "

"Daphne: Dr. Crane. "
"Niles: Hello, Daphne. Is Dad around? I have that videotape he wanted to see. "
"Daphne: Actually, he's gone off with Donny. They went to a tractor pull. "
"Niles: Ohhh... "
"Daphne: As I understand it, they attach a large weight to a tractor and see how far they can pull it through the mud. "
"Niles: Ohhh... "
"Daphne: The answer to your next question is 'Beats the hell out of me.' "
"Frasier: Oh, hello, Daphne, Niles. "
"Niles: Hello, Frasier. "
"Daphne: Oh, Dr. Crane. I see you've grown yourself a crumb-catcher. "
"Frasier: Oh, please. Spare me your jocular euphemisms. I've heard them all from "
"Freddie: my chin-sweater, my face-fuzz, my hickey-hider. "
"Niles: Well, I think it suits you. "
"Frasier: Well, thank you, Niles. I just wanted to shake things up a bit, you know. "
"Niles: How was Boston? "
"Frasier: Oh, it was fine. It was great seeing Freddie again. Of course, Lilith was insufferable. She's got a new boyfriend, some twenty-eight year old named Marcel, he's a contortionist with the Cirque de Soleil. "
"Niles: She's dating French circus folk? "
"Frasier: Yes. Well, he's actually perfect for "
"Lilith: he has no apparent spine and she can wrap him around her finger. Of course, Lilith's smug satisfaction was a little hard to bear, though. Especially considering how long it's been since the circus came to my town. "
"Donny: I know I couldn't believe the weight of that thing Well, it's Grizzly Crane "
"Martin: Well, nice soup-strainer there, Fras. "
"Frasier: Thank you. "
"Donny: Oh, we just saw a hell of a tractor pull. Even you would have liked it. "
"Martin: So, how's my grandson? "
"Frasier: Oh, he's great, Dad. Actually, he loved the baseball mitt you sent him. "
"Donny: Where's Daphne? I got this little gift for her. "
"Niles: Oh, a John Deere cap. How... could you? "
"Donny: Oh no, I'm just giving it to her to see her pretend to like it. Then I'm gonna give her a bracelet. "
"Roz: Hey, Frasier. "
"Frasier: Oh, hi Roz. "
"Roz: Hmmm, cool beard "
"Frasier: Oh, thanks "
"Roz: Hey, Niles. "
"Niles: Hey, Roz. "
"Roz: OK, here's the directions, hotel confirmation and schedule. "
"Frasier: Excuse me? "
"Roz: Broadcast conference. "
"Frasier: Good lord I thought that was next week. "
"Roz: No, it's tonight I'm going up there right now. "
"Frasier: Oh no, Roz. I just got back from Boston, for God's sake. You know, maybe I could just drive up tomorrow and attend the panels. "
"Roz: No Frasier, tonight's reception's the most important part It sets the tone for the whole weekend. "
"Frasier: Oh, come on Last year everybody just got drunk and acted like a bunch of horny teenagers. "
"Roz: Exactly So stop yakkin' and start packin' "
"Niles: Well, you know, it could be just the relief you need after a long week with Lilith and Le Pretzel Boy. "
"Frasier: You know, come to think of it, there was one really gorgeous blonde up "
"there: Rush Hour Rita, Larame's Eye in the Sky. "
"Roz: Yeah, I remember her. The traffic was bumper to bumper outside her ROOM. "
"Frasier: Meow, Roz. "
"Roz: Oh, it's just that I am so sick of men becoming panting idiots just at the sight of blonde hair. "
"Niles: That is a bit of an oversimplification, Roz. "
"Frasier: Don't be ridiculous. It's insulting, Roz For God's sake, I mean, every man's taste is different. "
"Roz: Sorry, it's just that I met this guy at Nervosa today for coffee and it was very annoying. Every time I tried to say anything, this blonde waitress would walk by... "
"Martin: Oh, Mimi's back? "
"Frasier: Oh, that's good news. "
"Niles: Gotta stop in and see Mimi. "
"Frasier: You know, I guess I better get packing "
"Martin: What're you talking about? You got your bags right there. "
"Frasier: No, Dad, these are my 'Daddy' clothes. I have to go and pack my 'Come to Daddy' clothes. "
"Donny: Oh, will you give me a break? All right, all right My surveillance guy just cancelled for tonight, just when I need him for this big money divorce case. "
"Daphne: Is this the Stanley Redmond thing? "
"Donny: Yeah, the dumpster rental king. This guy controls half the dumpsters in the Northwest, his wife thinks he's been taking out the wrong kind of trash. You know, if I can prove it, this case is mine. "
"Niles: That is so depressing. You expect this sort of behavior from a mattress king, but we ask more of our dumpster royalty. "
"Donny: Yeah, but you should see this "
"girlfriend: leggy, blonde... "
"Niles: Oh, well, blonde That explains it "
"Roz: Goodbye. "
"Niles: I'm sorry. "
"Donny: Hey, wait a minute. Marty? You were a cop, right? You must've done surveillance. "
"Martin: Oh sure, all the time. "
"Donny: Well, why don't you work for me tonight? It's forty-five bucks an hour. "
"Niles: Oh, I don't think Dad would want to do that. "
"Martin: Forty-five bucks? "
"Donny: All right, fifty. But if you get a picture of Redmond and the girl, then it's a five hundred dollar bonus. "
"Martin: Five hundred dollars? "
"Donny: All right, seven hundred, you're killing me. "
"Niles: Dad, I don't think this is a good idea. Where exactly is this stakeout? "
"Donny: It's at the Alcazar apartments. You know, in Belltown. "
"Niles: Belltown is sort of a sketchy neighborhood, wouldn't you say? "
"Martin: Oh Niles, to you a sketchy neighborhood is when the cheese shop doesn't have valet parking. I'm an ex-cop, remember? "
"Niles: Yeah, yeah, I know you're an ex-cop. Let's just examine this, Dad... "
"Martin: No, no, no. Let's just forget about it. I'm not gonna listen to this all night. I just won't do it, are you satisfied? "
"Niles: Yes. Thank you. Donny, I'm sorry to put a crimp in your plans. "
"Donny: No, that's all right. I'm sure I'll find somebody else. You're still doing it, right? "
"Martin: Hell, yes "
"Roz: Thanks for watching Alice, Laurie. I really owe you one... Well, I just want to get down to this cocktail party before all the good men are taken... What? I just want to have a little fun tonight... No I do not mean that... All right, I do mean that. Uh, Laurie, I'll talk to you later. Thank you again, bye-bye. "
"Roz: Oh, hey Frasier. "
"Frasier: Hi Roz. My room isn't ready yet, can I put my stuff here until I can check in? "
"Roz: Come on in. "
"Frasier: Thanks. I tell you, the storm hasn't dampened the festivities downstairs. It's only seven o'clock and Marge Whitmeyer is already in the bar arm-wrestling people for drinks. "
"Roz: How many did you buy her? "
"Frasier: Well, three, but my elbow was in a wet spot. "
"Roz: Hey, did you happen to notice if that weather guy from KSGY was down there? "
"Frasier: Yes, I noticed that he was there. Something tells me the forecast calls for a collision between two warm fronts. "
"Roz: Hello? Oh, yeah, he's here. It's the front desk. "
"Frasier: Hello? Yes? Well then, you'll just have to get me a room elsewhere I see. Thank you very much. They don't have a room for me. "
"Roz: What're you gonna do? "
"Frasier: Well, guess I could stay on the couch. "
"Roz: What? "
"Frasier: Oh, come on Roz I got no choice The whole island is booked. "
"Roz: Well, this is sure gonna cramp my style. I mean, it's not like college when everybody just... never mind. "
"Frasier: You know Roz, we're two attractive people. We're at a conference that turns into a bacchanal every year, odds are neither of us will need this room tonight. "
"Roz: You're right. What's the problem? "
"Frasier: I believe there's a cocktail party awaiting us? "
"Roz: Let's go down together. We'll be like jackals, they hunt in pairs. "
"Frasier: I like your self-assurance. There's no greater aphrodisiac than confidence. "
"Roz: Shall we? "
"Frasier: Let the games begin "
"Roz: I just need a little more lipstick. "
"Frasier: I'm sweatin' right through this shirt. "
"Martin: Niles... "
"Niles: You specifically promised me... "
"Martin: Would you shut up and get in here? "
"Martin: How did you know I was here? "
"Niles: The doorman "
"Martin: Bigmouth. "
"Niles: Well, I guess he didn't realize he was being sworn to secrecy when you said 'Hey Sid, I'm goin' on a stakeout.' I can't believe you lied to me. "
"Martin: Well, I'm sorry, but you were makin' such a big fuss about nothing. "
"Niles: It is not nothing Look at this neighborhood. [looking in the side-view mirror] I'm not even happy parking my Mercedes here. "
"Martin: It's not that bad. "
"Niles: Oh, really? Well then could you explain to me the ominous group of men standing back there in the shadows by my car? They're all wearing the same sort of dark coat, it's some sort of gang. "
"Martin: Niles, they're Hasidic Jews. "
"Niles: That's right, keep walking, keep walking... "
"Martin: So, what, you came down here to bawl me out? "
"Niles: Yes... partly. Also to give you this. "
"Martin: What's this? "
"Niles: Clam chowder. "
"Martin: Oh-ho "
"Niles: I remember Mom used to make it for you when you went ice fishing, and I hated the thought of you sitting out here cold and hungry. "
"Martin: Well thank you, I appreciate it. But, look, why don't you just go back home, now. I'll be fine. "
"Niles: No, I'll just stay awhile, you could use the company. "
"Martin: Oh, come on, Niles, why don't you tell me what's really on your mind? "
"Niles: All right, Dad, I was worried about you. "
"Martin: I knew it. Because I'm an old man and I can't take care of myself "
"Niles: No. Age has nothing to do with it. I've always worried about you, that's what it's like when your father's a cop. I worried about you when I was five years old. And I didn't stop worrying until the day you retired. And today just brought it all back again. "
"Martin: Look, I'm sorry. For what it's worth, I know what you mean. My dad was a cop, too. "
"Niles: I know. "
"Martin: But, you know, Niles, I'm not chasin' after bad guys. I'm just gonna take a picture. "
"Niles: That's true. I'm probably overreacting like usual. Uh, well I guess I'll head home. "
"Martin: No, no, hey wait a little bit. Stick around. How'd you like a little clam chowder? "
"Niles: I'd love some "
"Martin: This is clam chowder "
"Niles: Well, what'd you expect? "
"Martin: Irish whiskey Your mother always filled it with coffee and Irish whiskey We just called it clam chowder in front of you kids. "
"Niles: Is that why you got so mad that day I crumbled oyster crackers in your thermos? "
"Roz: What happened to you? "
"Frasier: Same thing that happened to you... I got a hug goodnight. "
"Roz: Where did we go wrong? Rush Hour Rita was draping herself all over you, and that news guy actually said to me if I gave him twenty-two minutes he'd give me the world. "
"Frasier: Well, I don't know, Roz. After he gave you the brush-off, he came over and sat down next to me and Rita. Before I knew it, they had discovered their mutual fondness for tango music. "
"Roz: I lose out to tango music? What a night A total bust "
"Frasier: Oh, come on, Roz. You know, for my money, you were the most attractive woman down there. "
"Roz: Thanks, Frasier. And I'm not just saying this to return the favor, but you look really hot in that beard. "
"Frasier: Oh, well, thanks. You know, maybe we're better off, just a couple of old friends having a cozy evening together. "
"Roz: Yeah, right. It's him "
"Frasier: It's her "
"Both: Come in, hello. "
"Waiter: Sorry to disturb you, but the manager wanted to apologize for the mix-up with the room. [He puts down a champagne bucket.] This is on us. "
"Roz: That's nice. "
"Frasier: Well, you in the mood for a glass of champers, Roz? "
"Roz: I don't know, what do you think? "
"Waiter: It won't fit in the mini-bar. "
"Frasier: Well, it's settled then. I can open it myself, thanks. Here you are. "
"Waiter: Thank you. "
"Frasier: Well, ah. Demi-sec, respectable label, not a bad year. We may just be having a better time than anybody else here. "
"Niles: Dad, this thing is amazing I can actually hear some guy brushing his teeth Swish, swish, spit. Swish, swish... flossing "
"Martin: Niles "
"Niles: You have got to try this, it's incredible Here, put those on... "
"Martin: All right. "
"Niles: All right, now point that anywhere you want. "
"Martin: Aaaarrrrghh Niles, will you quit kidding around? This isn't a game, it's a job I just want to spot the guy, get a picture and get out of here. So why don't we just sit here and be quiet for a while. "
"Niles: You know, Dad, are you sure you want to be doing this? "
"Martin: I thought you said you weren't worried about me. "
"Niles: No, no, I'm not worried about your safety, I just mean are you doing the right thing? Meddling in this guy's marriage. You know, speaking as a psychiatrist... "
"Martin: Oh boy, open up a window. "
"Niles: I just see this sort of thing in my practice all the time. People make mistakes, and-and have affairs, and find some way to fix it. It's possible that by taking this picture, you're destroying any chance this man has. "
"Martin: Niles, the guy's a bum He's probably always been a bum. Now, if you want to get into a debate about something, maybe you can tell me what those grass clippings were doing in the clam chowder. "
"Niles: That was lemon grass, and Chef Andre has gotten high kudos for that soup. "
"Martin: Well, if kudos are those brown chewy things, he can have 'em. I put mine in the ashtray. "
"Niles: You pretend to be such a cynic. I think you agree with me. You have too much of a conscience not to. "
"Martin: Oh, bappity, bappity, bap. Oh, there they are [He grabs the camera.] "
"Niles: You're still gonna take this picture? "
"Martin: Ho-ho, you're damned right I am "
"Niles: Even though right now that man may be planning to break it off with his girlfriend tonight? Planning to, to rededicate himself to his marriage? The terrible guilt spurring him on to ever-greater depths of commitment, and, and, and years from now he may be sitting with his wife, by the fire, holding her hand, reflecting on all their wonderful years together, especially their SUNSET years. And you could destroy all that with one click of a camera. "
"Martin: Sorry, Niles, what were you saying? "
"Niles: You took a picture of that tree and you know it "
"Martin: All right, I did What'd you have to talk about all that stuff for? "
"Niles: I was just saying what you were already thinking. You did the right thing and you're not gonna to regret it. "
"Martin: Yeah, well how am I going to tell Donny I just sat here and watched them walk by and get in the car? "
"Niles: You'll tell him proudly because you know in your heart of hearts... "
"Martin: Whoa They backed into your Mercedes "
"Niles: I don't believe it They're not even leaving a note... they're driving away "
"Martin: Well, I wouldn't worry about it, Niles. They're probably RACKED with grief and it'll spur them on to ever-greater... "
"Niles: Oh shut up and take their picture Hurry up and get their license number Hurry Hurry "
"Roz: Ummm, my longest relationship would have to be Ted, '88 to '90. No Derek, '89 to '92. "
"Frasier: Being a gentleman, Roz, I won't point out the slight overlap there. "
"Roz: It's not an overlap, it's a transition. "
"Frasier: Uh-huh. "
"Roz: You know, like in April when you start wearing your spring clothes, even though you're wearing your winter stuff? "
"Frasier: Yeah, well, if we're talking April of '90, I doubt you were wearing much of anything at all. "
"Roz: OK, wise guy, what was your longest relationship? "
"Frasier: Oh, that's easy, Lilith. Although... "
"Roz: What? "
"Frasier: Well, if we're not talking romantic relationship, well, then umm, my longest relationship with a woman would be "
"you: seven years. "
"Roz: Loser Seven years "
"Frasier: Gosh. "
"Roz: My God, it has been that long. "
"Frasier: It's worth toasting. "
"Roz: Absolutely. So Frasier, what's with the beard? "
"Frasier: You hate it. "
"Roz: No Actually I like it. It's like you're Frasier but not Frasier. What made you do it? "
"Frasier: Oh, I don't know. I just wanted to change things a little, I don't know, be spontaneous. "
"Roz: Oh, my God, I almost did something like that this weekend. "
"Frasier: Really? "
"Roz: Yeah, I... Oh, hell, I'll show you [She puts down her glass and gets up, putting her hand on Frasier's leg.] Ooh, nice silk pajamas. I made a little purchase on my way up here. "
"Frasier: Did you? Well, I am just dying with anticipation. What is it? "
"Roz: You promise you won't laugh? "
"Frasier: I promise. "
"Roz: OK. Hold on one second. I'll be right out "
"Roz: I just wanted to see for once in my life what it would be like to be a blonde. I thought I'd wear it down to the bar one night. Pretty pathetic, huh? "
"Frasier: On the contrary, Roz. It's, it's quite becoming. It's like you're Roz but not Roz. "
"Roz: Hello stranger. You here for the conference? "
"Frasier: Yes, I am. "
"Roz: Is this seat taken? "
"Frasier: It's been waiting for you all its life. [She sits next to him.] Champagne? "
"Roz: Well, I'm not sure I should. I already had one glass, and it went straight to my head. I feel like maybe I should lie down. "
"Frasier: You could use my room... "
"Roz: Are you sure you're a gentleman? "
"Frasier: Well, I do prefer blondes... "
"Roz: God, how many times have I had that conversation? "
"Frasier: What would life be without the occasional surrender to impulse? "
"Roz: It's true, it does makes you feel alive. "
"Frasier: Doing things you know you shouldn't do. "
"Roz: With people you shouldn't be with. "
"Frasier: Right. "
"Roz: Right. "
"Frasier: You know, suddenly, this couch seems a little small for me. "
"Roz: Well the bed seems pretty big. "
"Frasier: It's a big bed. "
"Roz: It is. "
"Frasier: Roz... "
"Frasier: For God's sake "
"Frasier: You all right? "
"Frasier: Kenny "
"Kenny: I got stuck in the storm Now they don't have a room for me. I hear we're in the same boat, huh Doc? Oh, hiya Roz. "
"Roz: Hey. "
"Kenny: Hey, cool wig "
"Roz: Thanks. "
"Kenny: Hey, wait a minute, I'm not interrupting anything, am I? Pyjamas, champagne, a fire... [He winks broadly. They all laugh.] So, anyhow, can I bunk here? "
"Roz: Why not? "
"Frasier: No reason. "
"Kenny: Great, great. I really like that blonde hair, Roz. You better be careful "
"though: get the doc here all hot and bothered. Ha ha. Well, just gonna get out of these wet clothes. I had a heck of a time gettin' here. All these road look the same. [Frasier and Roz come together, looking into each other's eyes again.] I ended up taking a wrong turn... The last thing you want to do out here in these woods is take a wrong turn. "
"Frasier: Quite right, Kenny. "
"Frasier: You know, I, I'm not sure the beard's really workin'. I probably should shave it off. "
"Roz: I wasn't gonna say anything, but yeah. "
"Kenny: I don't wear one of these snore strips, I'm a buzz saw going through steel pipe. So, ah, 'Rock, Paper, Scissors' for the sofa? "
"Roz: I'll take it. "
"Kenny: OK. Looks like it's you and me in the bed, Doc. "
"Frasier: OK. "
"Kenny: But I warn you, I'm a roller. What was I thinking, drinking all that coffee on the way up here? I'm gonna be up all night, I am WIRED. [He rolls over, taking all the covers with him.] "
"Frasier: Uh, Kenny, do you think you could, uh... [Loud snores from Kenny's side.] "
"Roz: Goodnight, Frasier. "
"Frasier: Goodnight, Roz. "

"Frasier: Daphne "
"Daphne: Hey. "
"Frasier: Hello, I thought you were spending the afternoon with Dad. "
"Daphne: He's in the loo. Why don't you join us? "
"Frasier: All right, thank you. Hey, did you happen to catch the show today? I was on fire. First caller was an agoraphobic – Boom - knocked it right out of the park. Then, two troubled marriages and a compulsive over-eater – Boom-boom, Boom I was a regular mental health dispensing machine. "
"Daphne: I did two loads of laundry and cut a piece of gum out of Eddie's hair. "
"Frasier: Now, Daphne, don't get down on yourself. The work you do at home is very important. In fact, I don't know what Dad and I are going to do once you're married. "
"Daphne: Thank you, Dr. Crane, that makes me feel better. "
"Frasier: Boom Boy, there is no off-switch on this thing "
"Daphne: Sadly, that's true. "
"Frasier: Oh, there she is, the other half of our team. Roz, are you still as jazzed as I am? "
"Roz: They're taking us off the air "
"Frasier: What? Since when? "
"Roz: Well, while you were out looking for Gatorade to pour over yourself, Kenny came by and said he's yanking us for a week. He wants to try out that new show - you know, 'Car Chat with Bob and Bethany.' "
"Frasier: 'Car Chat with Bob and Bethany,' what the... Ohhh, touché, Kenny. You are indeed a worthy adversary but you shall find I have a trick or two of my own "
"Daphne: You know, Dr. Crane, maybe a week off would do you some good. "
"Frasier: No, no, no, you don't understand. See, I'm actually renegotiating my contract right now, this is merely the station's tactic to try and get me to cave. "
"Roz: Well, I hope you're right. "
"Frasier: Well, of course I'm right; Bob and Bethany, Car chat, please I mean how can anyone drone on for three hours about a subject that nobody even understands "
"Roz: Yeah We were there first "
"Daphne: Don't worry, Dr. Crane, I'm sure you're right about these things. After all, you usually are. "
"Frasier: Well, thank you, Daphne, that's exactly what I needed to hear. "
"Daphne: Boom "
"Frasier: Oh, hi Dad. "
"Martin: Boy, they really did a job in the men's room, didn't they? "
"Frasier: Oh, I hadn't noticed. "
"Martin: Oh yeah, completely re-did "
"it: Fancy wallpapers, bright new tiles, even those little perfumed soaps that you like to use at home, Fras. "
"Daphne: Oh, for heaven's sakes, you went into the ladies room, you blind old sod I've been begging him for months to get glasses. "
"Martin: Ladies room? You're crazy, that guy was just in there. "
"Frasier: Oh hi, Bethany. Listen, good luck in the slot next week. "
"Bethany: Thanks, we're pumped. "
"Frasier: Granted, Dad, Bethany may be a bit of a tough call, but still, you know, it wouldn't hurt to get a check-up. "
"Martin: Oh, come on, don't you start too. There's nothing wrong with my eyes. Now, if you don't mind, I just want to sit here quietly and have a... [notices the cup he picked up] ...have a drink of cream, do you have a problem with that? Good. "
"Daphne: Hi, Dr. Crane. "
"Frasier: Oh, hello, Daphne. Say, you know my agent, Bebe, said she might be stopping by. Have you heard anything? "
"Daphne: No, and I hope she's not staying for lunch, I'm afraid we're fresh out of live mice. "
"Martin: Hi, Fras. "
"Frasier: Dad. "
"Frasier: Is it my imagination or are those ladies’ glasses? "
"Daphne: Yes, but don't you say anything. I had to drag him down to the store. He tried on every pair in the place, those were the only ones he liked. "
"Martin: So, how do you like the new specs? "
"Frasier: They certainly are eye-catching. "
"Martin: Yeah. You should have seen the looks I got all day. Mostly from women. You know, I'd like to think it was me but I've got an idea that these frames were designed with an eye to pleasing the ladies. "
"Frasier: I'd say that's a safe assumption. "
"Martin: Have you seen the case for them? I don't know what I did with it. "
"Daphne: Yes, I think I popped them into my purse, check my room. "
"Martin: Okey-doke. Oh, wait till you see this case, Fras. This Loren guy really knows what he's doing. [exits to Daphne's room] "
"Frasier: Ralph Lauren? "
"Daphne: Sophia. "
"Frasier: I'm amazed you could keep a straight face all day. "
"Daphne: Well, I've done enough clothes shopping with your father. I'm pretty good at pretending to like things, no matter how horrifying I find them. "
"Daphne: Bebe, how nice to see you. "
"Bebe: Frasier, my favorite client, Seattle's golden-throated gift to the airwaves. "
"Frasier: So, I take it negotiations aren't going so well? "
"Bebe: You remember that insulting figure you said you'd never accept? "
"Frasier: Uh-huh. "
"Bebe: They haven't come up to it yet. "
"Frasier: Oh, dear. "
"Niles: Knock, knock. "
"Frasier: Oh, come on in, Niles. Bebe's just bringing me up to speed on her depressing news about my contract negotiations. "
"Bebe: Don't worry, dear, I just need to find a way to throw a scare into 'em. "
"Niles: Have you tried turning into a bat? "
"Bebe: I would, love, but most grown men don't share your fear of tiny creatures "
"Frasier: Could you two please catch up later? "
"Bebe: I did get one offer that I thought might give us some leverage. It's a TV job. "
"Frasier: Television? "
"Bebe: Unfortunately it's all wrong for you. They want you and Roz to host 'AM Seattle' next week. "
"Niles: That vapid morning chat show? "
"Bebe: Exactly what I told them. Frasier Crane is a doctor He heals the masses, he doesn't pander to them. He's not going to do some silly morning kaffeeklatch, no matter how fabulously popular it is. "
"Frasier: No, it's quite right, Bebe. That sort of show, it's beneath me. "
"Bebe: Exactly. "
"Frasier: It's undignified. "
"Bebe: Horribly. "
"Frasier: Still... "
"Bebe: I'm listening. "
"Frasier: If there were a way to do it with a bit more dignity, some polish and substance... "
"Bebe: Why didn't I think of that? "
"Frasier: You know, a dash of high society, a dollop of culture... "
"Niles: I can't believe you're even considering this. The show is nothing more than a mélange of bad jokes and mind-numbing banter. "
"Frasier: Yes, well, it doesn't have to be, Niles, don't you see? I mean, if I could choose the guests myself- "
"Bebe: You can. "
"Frasier: And control the content- "
"Bebe: You could. "
"Frasier: Well, then, I'd accept. "
"Bebe: We did. I mean, we will. In fact, why don't I call them right now with the exciting news. [takes out phone and a cigarette] May I? "
"Frasier: On the balcony, if you don't mind. "
"Bebe: Mind? I don't want a single puff tearing up the baby blues of TV's newest sensation. By this time next week... "
"Niles: You heard him, if you're gonna blow smoke, do it on the balcony. "
"Niles: Well, I can't say I'm surprised. "
"Frasier: What is that supposed to mean? "
"Niles: Only that something like this was inevitable. It's the final step in your descent from legitimate psychiatrist to dancing bear. "
"Frasier: Niles, we are talking about doing a sophisticated television show for one week in order to improve my contract negotiations. "
"Niles: This has nothing to do with your contract negotiations You have been an applause junky ever since you first set foot on a grammar school stage. "
"Frasier: I was drawn to the theatre because of its discipline and collaborative spirit "
"Niles: Oh please, in your sixth grade production of 'Oklahoma' you took so many curtain calls, Mrs. Van Raphorst had to lasso you and pull you from the stage "
"Frasier: That woman never understood me or the role of Farmer Number Three "
"Niles: Oh, I'm just wasting my breath. As usual you have fallen under the spell of that sorceress out there. "
"Frasier: I have done no such thing. I wish you would just lay off of Bebe. You know, she is not some malign witch who can transform people at will "
"Martin: I can't find a damn thing in this purse "
"Niles: If I say I'm sorry, will she change Dad back into a man? "
"Frasier: Well, it took several of your best people, but I believe they have finally wrestled this feisty cow-lick of mine into submission. So, are we ready to roll? "
"Matt: Not quite, your partner's not here. "
"Frasier: Roz is not here? But we're on in four minutes. "
"Matt: No, at this point a re-run is on in four minutes. "
"Bebe: Don't worry, Matt, she'll be here. "
"Matt: We won't even have time to put her through make-up. "
"Bebe: A natural beauty like Roz? Oh, please, darling, pinch her cheeks, stand back and watch her glow. "
"Roz: Hey, sorry I'm late. "
"Frasier: Roz, oh for God's sakes, you look awful, are you sick? "
"Roz: No, of course not, I wouldn't be sick for our big debut. I'm totally fine. "
"Frasier: Roz, you're burning up "
"Roz: Well, it's kinda hot in here, maybe it's all these lights. Let me just get this jacket off "
"Frasier: No, no, Roz, stop, stop "
"Matt: She's delirious "
"Bebe: With anticipation, darling. Don't worry, I'll calm her down. "
"Bebe: Pull yourself together, do you hear me? We need this show "
"Matt: All right, everyone, we're doing a re-run, let the audience go, cue the tapes. "
"Bebe: Wait? Can't Frasier do the show without her? "
"Matt: This is a chat show, who's he going to chat with? "
"Bebe: Me, I'll go on with him. "
"Frasier: You? Pull yourself together, Roz "
"Matt: I don't think so, Bebe. "
"Bebe: Why not? All he needs is someone to suck up to him, laugh at his jokes, pretend to listen to his stories. I'm his agent, for God's sakes, that's what I do "
"Frasier: You know, I believe she could pull it off. "
"Matt: The problem is she needs to be likable. "
"Frasier: Right. Do I at least get to keep the suit? "
"Bebe: Hold on, I can be likable. I can also be very un-likable. Maybe if you explained the difference to poor confused Bebe. For instance, what you were doing in the dressing room with the wardrobe girl an hour ago - would your wife find that likable or unlikable? "
"Matt: Could you put some make-up on this woman? "
"Manager: Okay, folks, sixty seconds. "
"Frasier: All right, Bebe, just follow my lead. I'll introduce us and then I'll get to our guests, all right? "
"Frasier: Wasn't our first guest Susan Sontag? "
"Bebe: She had a conflict. Don't worry, we've got a fabulous replacement. "
"Frasier: 'Baby Leo, the world's biggest two year-old'? "
"Bebe: You're gonna love him. Just remember to lift with your legs. "
"Frasier: That's it, this is unacceptable. "
"Bebe: Ohhh, now who's the world's biggest baby? "
"Frasier: Bebe, I will not do this show... "
"Manager: And we're on in five, four... "
"Frasier: Hi, welcome to 'AM Seattle.' I'm Dr. Frasier Crane. "
"Bebe: And I'm Bebe Glaser. "
"Frasier: We're gonna be your hosts this week and believe me, we've got some great shows lined up for you. But before we get to our guests I'd like to take a few moments to share with you a few thoughts I've prepared on a very special time of the day, the time that we'll be spending together, morning. A new beginning. A daily rebirth, if you will. "
"Matt: What the hell is this? Banter, banter. [he mimes banter to Bebe] "
"Frasier: And even though AM stands for Anti-Meridian, if you simply put them together, they also make up the word 'am' as in 'I am.' "
"Bebe: Whoa Not before my coffee As you can see, Frasier has a way with words, but did you also know that he has a way with voices. "
"Frasier: Excuse me? "
"Bebe: Who wants to hear Frasier's famous Sean Connery impression? "
"Frasier: Now, Now, Moneypenny, you're embarrassing me. "
"Bebe: Dr. Frasier Crane, ladies and gentlemen. Anymore impressions, Frasier? "
"Frasier: You know what, maybe I should just get back to my... "
"Bebe: Now, don't be shy Who wants to hear Frasier do more impressions? "
"Frasier: It's just that I'd hate to take time away from our other guests. I believe that James Mason may be stopping by to visit. "
"Frasier: Well, this has been some week. "
"Bebe: It's really flown by. "
"Frasier: Hasn't it? "
"Bebe: Whoosh "
"Frasier: A-whoosh "
"Bebe: And there's even time for Thursday's kitchen corner. We'll be right back with Chef Frasier. "
"Matt: And we're clear. "
"Frasier: Bebe, 'Kitchen corner?' I thought we had the violin prodigy up next. For God sakes, we've bumped Kim Lee twice this week. "
"Bebe: I know, but we're running short of time and the cooking segment's going to be bopo "
"Frasier: Well, all right, but I insist Kim Lee play over the closing credits, all right? We're not running some sort of tacky, run-of-the-mill morning show "
"Director: Here's your chef's costume. "
"Bebe: Now, now, big dear. You know, Frasier, the most magical thing happened to me last night during dinner. "
"Frasier: Really? "
"Bebe: I was recognized. "
"Frasier: Intoxicating, isn't it? Gosh, I myself, no stranger to celebrity, have noticed more heads swiveling in my direction. "
"Matt: And we're back in five, four, three, two... "
"Frasier: Welcome back. "
"Bebe: Frasier, I hear you're quite the gourmet. "
"Frasier: Oh please, I don't do anything fancy. A few soufflés, a flambé or two, just good eats Now, this morning I'm going to be making my signature breakfast for you. That's 'Eggs Pelemo Fontana.' "
"Bebe: Mmmm, makes my mouth water. But before we start, I have a little sweetheart backstage who's dying to come out and give you a hand. "
"Frasier: Is it Kim Lee? "
"Bebe: Not even close. It's Bobo, the cooking chimp "
"Frasier: Ho-ho, that's very funny, it is. This has Matt's fingerprints all over it "
"Bebe: We thought it might be great fun if you were to match your skills against him. "
"Frasier: Oh, I don't know, Bebe. Er.... "
"Bebe: Well, let's let the audience decide. How many of you want to see the monkey make eggs? Now, how many of you want to see Bobo make eggs? "
"Frasier: Ouch Well, all right, apes before beauty "
"Bebe: Frasier, Bobo, may the best chef win "
"Frasier: Now, the first rule of boute cusine is to be sure that you have all of your ingredients at hand. You see, we have eggs, milk, butter, spinach and of course our old friend, the shallot "
"Frasier: Why, look at that, he's not even pre-heating the pan, the beast "
"Bebe: Bobo's getting an early lead. "
"Frasier: It's very important to keep your eggs light and fluffy, so what you want to do is add a bit of milk and a touch of flour. "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Now this whole thing was improvised. "
"Daphne: You're kidding, it's like you and the chimp have been working together for years "
"Martin: Boy, that's great stuff, Frasier. You know, I can't tell you how impressed the guys at McGinty's are that I have such a famous son. "
"Frasier: Really? What do they say? "
"Martin: Well, they don't say anything to my face, but when I walk in they kind of nudge each other and whisper. "
"Daphne: That'll be my Shepherd's Pie. "
"Martin: Shepherd's Pie? "
"Frasier: You know, I must confess, there's a part of me that wishes I could still do the TV show. "
"Martin: Well, there's a part of me that wishes that monkey was cooking dinner instead of you-know-who... but we put our dreams away "
"Frasier: Oh, hi, Roz. Well, don't you look nice. Are you feeling better? "
"Roz: Yes, thank you. Can we talk? "
"Frasier: Well, of course, come on in. What's the matter? "
"Roz: Well, I talked to my friends in business affairs and they say they're ready to close our deal but Bebe's holding it up. "
"Frasier: Well, of course she's holding it up, she's trying to make them sweat a little bit. That's the whole strategy behind the TV "
"show: leverage. "
"Roz: Yeah, well, I heard a rumor that 'AM Seattle' isn't happy with their regular hosts and I think she's angling for you to take over. So where does that leave me? "
"Frasier: Well, even if that was Bebe's plan, you're forgetting that it's still my career and I'm calling the shots. There is no way I would continue doing 'AM Seattle.' "
"Roz: Yeah, well, you look like you are having the time of your life. "
"Frasier: I'm playing a character There is a big difference between 'Dr. Frasier Crane, psychiatrist' and 'Frasier Crane, the guy who starts your morning right.' I'll tell you what. I will speak to Bebe when we're in the chair. Oh, that's the industry term for when we're getting our make-up put on. "
"Roz: Thanks, Frasier. God, this is so weird Daphne usually has such great taste, what was she thinking with these glasses? "
"Frasier: Well, actually, Roz... "
"Roz: I've gotta go see what these look like. "
"Martin: Hi, Roz. "
"Roz: Hey. "
"Martin: He-he-he, somebody ought to tell Mr. Doyle she's wearing a dude's glasses "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Oh, Kiki, you're a magician. "
"Bebe: Frasier, you're not going to believe the wonderful news I just "
"got: they want us to stay on. "
"Frasier: What? "
"Bebe: Yes, we had the highest ratings the show's had all year. "
"Frasier: I don't believe this, Roz was right. You had no intention of negotiating my radio contract. "
"Bebe: ...I don't expect gratitude, Frasier. Just a little faith. I finished your KACL contract this morning. "
"Frasier: You did? "
"Bebe: And I did quite a good job, I might add. "
"Frasier: Oh, I'm sorry, Bebe, I owe you an apology... Well, this is wonderful, got an extra week's vacation and a very handsome raise. "
"Bebe: It's garbage compared to what they'll give us to stay on here. You'll get an expense account, a wardrobe allowance, not to mention a car and driver. "
"Frasier: No, no, let's not forget why I took this job. It was to raise my profile, to get a better deal with the radio contract, and we've done that, Bebe. And I thank you. "
"Bebe: You're welcome, darling, and I respect your choice. "
"Frasier: Thanks. "
"Bebe: Now, let's talk about today's show. "
"Frasier: Right. "
"Bebe: We start with the Friday Fiesta, here are our costumes... and then we move on to the Girl Scout cookie-selling champ... and then we... "
"Frasier: Bebe, are you all right? "
"Bebe: I spent my life in the wings, it was just nice having my moment in the spotlight. The rush when that little red light on camera turns on... The stupid masking tape on that dressing room door with my name on it... "
"Frasier: The stage door johnnys, or whatever that strange man with the autograph book calls himself... "
"Bebe: Admit it, darling, you want this as much as I do. I saw it in your eyes during the pie-eating contest. Nobody loves blueberries that much, it's the audience you love "
"Announcer: Are you ready for Bebe and Frasier? "
"Bebe: Listen to them They want you "
"Frasier: They do want me, don't they? "
"Bebe: Tell me to tear up the contract, Frasier. "
"Frasier: Maybe it is time for a change... "
"Niles: Get away from him, you she-thing "
"Frasier: Niles "
"Niles: It's a good thing Dad started choking on that peanut or I would have never come back here for water. Stop this madness "
"Bebe: He can't stop it, no one can, show business is in his blood "
"Niles: No, psychiatry is. Frasier, you're a healer. "
"Bebe: Anyone can heal. You're better than that, you're an entertainer "
"Frasier: Oh God, Niles, she's right. I love the audience. I know it's shallow but it makes me feel alive. "
"Niles: Do you have any idea how ridiculous you look in this outfit? Frasier, I know I sometimes I make light of your radio show, but the truth is you provide help and hope and comfort to people who need it. I have always envied you that. "
"Bebe: Don't listen to that drivel "
"Frasier: He's right, Bebe. I'm a psychiatrist, I can't do the show anymore. I'm sorry. "
"Bebe: Then quit Who needs ya? I'll find some other stuffed shirt who's happy to ride my coat tails to fame. Niles, you're a doctor. "
"Frasier: Niles, don't look into her eyes "
"Bebe: Well, that's it... the dream is over. "
"Matt: Thirty seconds "
"Bebe: But I'm still a professional. There's an audience out there waiting for two people to ride in on a donkey. I don't know about you, but I'm not going to let them down. "
"Niles: It's your last show. Get out there "
"Frasier: Thanks, brother, for keeping me grounded. "
"Niles: Vaya Con Dios "
"Announcer: And here they are, Bebe and Frasier "

"Frasier: Oh, er, Dad... "
"Martin: It's not here yet "
"Frasier: How did you even... "
"Martin: You've been yakking about it for weeks Your new blazer's coming, it's Italian, it's hand-stitched, it cost more money than my first car. "
"Frasier: Yes, well, it's made from very expensive material. They have to find exactly the right kind of goat. "
"Martin: Looks like they did "
"Daphne: Morning, Dr. Crane. I made you a special breakfast. "
"Frasier: Why, thank you, Daphne. "
"Daphne: After all, blazer-day comes but once a year "
"Frasier: The doorman said he was on his way up with it. I wonder what's keeping him? "
"Frasier: Regan. "
"Regan: Frasier Long time no see. "
"Frasier: Yes, it has been. "
"Regan: I think the last time was when you came over with that bottle of wine. "
"Frasier: Oh, right. I met your charming boyfriend. "
"Regan: Scott. "
"Frasier: Scott. "
"Regan: And he's not my boyfriend anymore. "
"Frasier: Oh, well, he wasn't really all that charming... "
"Regan: Well, it's nice seeing you again, Frasier. "
"Frasier: Likewise. "
"Frasier: Wasn't that interesting? I just ran into Regan. Seems she's not seeing that Scott anymore. "
"Martin: What, the ballplayer, is she nuts? He had money and looks, the whole package. "
"Frasier: Dad, let him go "
"Martin: Are you going to ask her out? "
"Frasier: I don't know, every time I've had a chance to get close to Regan, it seems I end up looking ridiculous. Still, she did make a point of letting me know she was single again. Perhaps she's hinting for another ride on the 'Frasier-go- round.' "
"Martin: Now, if we could just figure out why you always look ridiculous "
"Donny: Look, please, you're my last chance, Vinny's already... No, I understand, I understand, don't worry about it, bye. "
"Frasier: Problem? "
"Donny: Yeah, it's my bachelor party, my best man can't arrange it and I'm having a hell of a time trying to find somebody to fill in. "
"Frasier: Well, Donny, if you're looking for someone to throw you an appropriate shindig, I'd be willing to volunteer. "
"Donny: Oh. No, no, no, no, I don't think so, it's okay, I just don't want to impose... "
"Frasier: No, no, it's no trouble at all, really. "
"Donny: No, no, no, no It'll be fine, but thanks for the offer, though. Frasier, I don't think we're talking about the same kind of party. "
"Frasier: Donny, if you're letting my reputation as an aesthete cloud your judgment, I assure you I am just one of the guys, capable of getting down and dirty with the rest of them "
"Doorman: Your jacket, Dr. Crane. "
"Frasier: Dear God You never fold cashmere, you'll mis- direct the knap Get out Donny, give it some thought. "
"Frasier: Morning, Roz. "
"Roz: Hey, Frasier. Help me decide something. "
"Frasier: All right. "
"Roz: I'm thinking about getting my eyes done. It's a little expensive... "
"Frasier: Now, now, Roz. Cosmetic surgery's a drastic step. I mean, if you're worried about those bags under your eyes, why don't you try just a different concealer, perhaps a good night's sleep once in a while. "
"Roz: I meant the laser procedure so I could see without my contacts "
"Frasier: Can I have my usual, please? Thank you. "
"Niles: I just saw the most incredible thing, you won't believe it. "
"Roz: What is it? "
"Niles: You have to see it for yourself, mere words cannot... Ooh, new jacket? "
"Frasier: Yes, just came today. "
"Niles: It's nice stitching. "
"Frasier: Thank you, chrystal "
"Niles: No. "
"Frasier: Yes. "
"Niles: Is there something wrong with the knap? "
"Frasier: Oh my God, is it that obvious...? "
"Roz: Would you knock it off, what is so amazing? "
"Niles: All right, come here, come here. "
"Niles: Right, you see that rotund woman coming out of 'Chock Full Of Donuts'? Watch, before she gets in her car she will finish that bear claw and then go back in, this is her third time. "
"Frasier: That's what you brought us over here for, to gawk at some poor woman's struggle with junk food? "
"Roz: Big deal, so she's overweight, you don't need to point it out "
"Roz: It's rude. "
"Frasier: It's childish. "
"Niles: It's Maris "
"Roz: No way "
"Frasier: Dear God, are you sure, Niles? "
"Niles: I'm positive. "
"Frasier: It's hard to believe that's the same frail woman who once sprained her wrist from having too much dip on a cracker. "
"Niles: Maris was always chubby as a child, her whole life she was obsessed with keeping weight off. "
"Roz: Something must have snapped "
"Niles: But literally, when she saw me she swallowed and her necklace exploded from the pressure. Oh, oh, oh, there she goes, back for more. "
"Frasier: Gosh. "
"Niles: You know, when I last saw her at Christmas she was her usual tiny self. "
"Frasier: Wait, Niles, wasn't that about the time you started dating her plastic surgeon? "
"Niles: Actually, it was. Do you think that could have triggered some sort of binge? "
"Frasier: Well... "
"Niles: Well, this isn't going to help. Mel and I are in the society page today, that's our picture at the symphony benefit. I shudder to think how Maris'll react to that, you know how petty and jealous she can get. "
"Frasier: They never take a photo of me and I'm in the conductor's circle "
"Roz: Well, she moved next door to 'Italian Deli.' The guy just took the two-foot salami out the window. "
"Niles: I can't face her now. That salami string should keep her busy until I can get to my car. "
"Frasier: Niles... "
"Roz: Hey, is that Niles in the paper? "
"Frasier: Yes, he just happened to have a copy with him As if anyone cares about such trivial matters "
"Roz: Oh, yeah, right. This is eating you up, you live for this hoity-toity crap. "
"Frasier: Thank you, I certainly do not. Why does everyone think that? You know, just this morning, Donny said I was too fussy to throw him a bachelor party. "
"Roz: Well, you did give off kinda a fussy vibe. "
"Frasier: Well, there are other sides to my personality. I remember back in my Boston days, you know, I mean, I had a regular bar and a regular bar stool, I even had a tab "
"Roz: Well, if you go back you should try having a beer "
"Frasier: Oh gosh, you know, maybe I have become stuffier. The highlight of my week was the arrival of my hand-tailored coat. Maybe it's time I loosened up a bit, try to tone down the whole fuddy-duddy image. Oh, Donny, it's Frasier. Listen, I would really like to throw that bachelor party for you. No, no, I assure you I know what goes on at one. Yes, I'm quite, quite qualified. Oh really? I promise you a night of such unrepentant debauchery that the mere memory will delight you in your old age, that is if you should survive the night [laughs, then to Roz] Do you think I'm overselling it a bit? "
"Roz: Maybe a tad. "
"Frasier: All right. That's great, oh, great, great, thanks, Donny. I'll tell you what I'm going to do, I'm going to go out and find you a stripper He-ha, maybe even more than one. "
"Roz: Strippers, huh? "
"Frasier: You betcha, a couple of real red hot mommas "
"Roz: You don't even know where to find one, do you? "
"Frasier: Not a clue "
"TO: "
"Frasier: Damn Damn Damn Open, damn you "
"Regan: Frasier. "
"Frasier: Regan Well, this is certainaly my lucky day, running into you twice. Gosh, I guess this must look a little strange. "
"Regan: Really, it's none of my business. "
"Frasier: No, no, actually, it's quite an amusing story. You see, I was just getting a 'Seattle Times' here and I got my coat stuck in the machine. "
"Regan: That's not the 'Seattle Times.' "
"Frasier: Hmm? Dear God They should label these things more clearly, this is some sort of a smut rag "
"Regan: It was nice seeing you. "
"Frasier: Regan... Regan... Ah... "
"Frasier: Well, if you get any in, could you please call me? Thank you. Gosh, I'm off to one helluva start with this bachelor party. First the debacle with Regan, now 'Sid's Novelty Shop' is completely out of naughty coasters. "
"Martin: Oh, would you stop moping, it'll all work ass. "
"Frasier: For God's sakes What the hell are you doing? "
"Donny: Honey, if your head hurts, you don't have to go. "
"Daphne: No, I'll be fine. Oh, Dr. Crane, I just want to tell you how happy I am you're throwing Donny's bachelor party. "
"Frasier: Oh, well, there you see, at least someone thinks I'm capable of throwing a... "
"Donny: ...nice low-key party just like my honey bunny insisted. "
"Daphne: Honestly, why men have to celebrate getting married by having bouncing buzzums shoved in their faces. [Donny pretends to act disgusted] If I know Dr. Crane, your party'll be over by nine- thirty, we could all go out for dinner afterwards. "
"Donny: Oh, that'd be swell. "
"Frasier: Gosh, you know, if Daphne's so down on this whole bachelor party idea, maybe I should throw a more sedate one. I don't want to get Donny in trouble. "
"Martin: Listen, your job's to give him the party he wants. Everything else is between them. It's absolutely none of your boobs "
"Dinah: Frasier Crane? "
"Frasier: Yes. "
"Dinah: I'm looking into a report of vandalism of a newspaper vending machine on Euclid Avenue, does that sound familiar to you? "
"Frasier: Well, I may have been in the area earlier today, er... "
"Dinah: Somebody on the scene recognized you as the perpetrator. Are you away of the penalty for vandalism? "
"Martin: Uh-oh "
"Frasier: Well, I may have dented the machine a little, but I... "
"Dinah: Frasier Crane, you have the right to remain... ...aroused. [she rips open her coat showing him her blue sparkely bra as music begins to play from her belt] Anything you see can be rubbed against you. [she begins to clamber on top of him, he holds her back] "
"Martin: She's a stripper "
"Frasier: I get it, Dad. Thank you, officer. "
"Martin: I knew that Daphne was going to be gone most of the afternoon so I figured I'd help you out. Boy, if you hire her for Donny's party, he'll put you in his will. "
"Dinah: So, do I get the job? "
"Frasier: I think you certainly seem qualified. Er, overqualified "
"Daphne: What's going on? "
"Martin: Daphne "
"Frasier: Er, well this is Officer Nasty. She's leaving the police force and I'm thinking of hiring her as the housekeeper, you see. I mean, once you marry Donny, you'll still be Dad's physical therapist, of course, but, er, we'll need someone around here to help with the chores, won't we? "
"Martin: Weren't you supposed to be out with Donny today? "
"Daphne: Yeah, I was, but I've got a splitting headache. So, how long have you been on the force? "
"Frasier: You know, er, I was just about to show the officer around the house and, er, discuss terms. "
"Daphne: All right, it was nice meeting you, Officer Nasty. "
"Dinah: Yeah. "
"Mel: Don't tell me to calm down It's a complete disaster, she'll ruin me. "
"Martin: What's going on? "
"Niles: It's Maris, she saw the picture of us today and she's determined to take it out on Mel. "
"Mel: Yes, she's telling everyone I caused her weight gain by nicking her thyroid during a neck tuck. I've already had three cancellations. She never thinks about anyone but herself Daphne, get me a cup of tea. "
"Daphne: Actually, I have a bit of a headache. "
"Mel: Oh, you could be coming down with something, wash your hands first. "
"Niles: Oh, you've got to calm down, your shoulders are so tense. Oh, you know, Daphne gives a wonderful massage, it might be just the thing for you. "
"Daphne: Actually, I was planning on taking a nap. "
"Mel: Oh, good, so you're not busy. Shall we do it in your room? "
"Niles: You two run along, I'll take care of the tea. [touching Daphne's hand] I really appreciate this, Daphne. "
"Daphne: You're welcome, Dr. Crane. "
"Martin: Niles, guess what your brother's doing? "
"Niles: Pressing his new blazer? "
"Martin: Yeah, against a stripper "
"Niles: What? "
"Martin: Yes, he's interviewing her in his room for Donny's bachelor party, but don't tell Daphne. "
"Niles: And how exactly do you interview a stripper? "
"Martin: I don't know but I bet there's a real show going on in there. "
"TO: Frasier's Bedroom. "
"Frasier: Keep the gun in it's holster until the very end, you see, that way your act has more... impact, shall we say? [takes gun out] Bang, bang, bang, bang. "
"Dinah: Men seem to like my act the way it is. "
"Frasier: Oh, well, I certainly can't tell you about attracting men but I do know a thing or two about showmanship. Tell me, what sort of encore do you have? "
"Dinah: I don't have an encore. "
"Frasier: Trust me, with this act we're going to need one. Er, I have an idea... "
"TO: Living Room "
"Niles: Well, Mel's all set up with Daphne. "
"Martin: Oh, maybe we ought to tell Frasier this is a good time to get that stripper out of here. "
"Frasier: Dad? "
"Martin: Fras, okay, coast is clear, everything's fine. "
"Frasier: Not exactly. "
"Martin: How did that happen? "
"Dinah: Lord of the Dance here decided I needed an encore. "
"Frasier: Well, I assumed you had the key. "
"Dinah: I never use them "
"Frasier: Right, we'll just have to cut them off. "
"Martin: All right, well come on in here. "
"Niles: I'm Niles. "
"TO: "
"Daphne: Now, you might come to a point where you feel like you can't take it anymore. I call that 'phase one.' "
"Mel: Are you sure you know what you're doing? "
"Daphne: I know exactly what I'm doing. [digs her elbow into the back of Mel's neck, making her scream again] Just relax. "
"Mel: Oh, this is all Maris's fault. You know, she actually called me and said she'd lay off if I stopped seeing him. "
"Daphne: What did you say? "
"Mel: Well, I hung up on her. How insane is this woman? She thinks I'd give up Niles to protect my practice? I'm crazy about him. The way he laughs, the way he gets that little glint in his eye when he's about to say something clever... "
"Mel: But do you know why I love him the most? It's like there are all these things that he could be if he could just trust someone enough to help him unlock it all. And if I could be that person - you know, that safe person in his life - well, the more I know him, the more I know that's all I want to be. Daphne? "
"TO: "
"Frasier: It isn't working Dad, there's only one thing left to do. "
"Martin: Well, I gotta warn you, I'm not as good a shot as I used to be. We'll have to go out on the balcony, I need a cup of coffee to steady my nerves "
"Frasier: Dad I meant go to a locksmith. "
"Martin: Oh, thank God, let's go. "
"to: Living Room "
"Dinah: Well, wait, hold on, I have to put something on. [doorbell sounds] "
"Niles: Wait, I'll get it. It's Maris. At least, I think it is. You need a bigger peep hole. "
"Frasier: What on earth is she doing here? "
"Niles: I have no idea, but we can't let her anywhere near Mel, especially now that Maris has the weight advantage. "
"Martin: Take her into Frasier's room. "
"Frasier: Wait, wait, wait, I can't let her see me like this, she'll blab it all over town. "
"Martin: Get in the bathroom, I'll call you when she leaves. "
"to: Powder Room. "
"Frasier: You know, seeing as how we have a minute or two here, I may as well take this opportunity to end the suspense. You've got the job. "
"Dinah: I've got a little news for you "
"too: I've been on the clock since you slapped the cuffs on me. "
"Frasier: Fair enough. "
"Dinah: It's freezing in here. "
"Frasier: Oh, let me. I seem to remember doing this back in my college days, fraternity hazing. "
"Frasier: There you are. "
"Dinah: Here we go. Thank you. "
"Frasier: It's hand-stitched. "
"Martin: Frasier, come on out. "
"Frasier: All right, we're outta here. "
"to: Living Room. "
"Martin: My God, have you seen Maris? "
"Frasier: Yes, Dad, I know. Did Niles calm her down? "
"Martin: Yeah, he took her to your room but he had to butter her up a little. "
"Frasier: I was afraid that narrow doorway might pose a problem. "
"to: Hallway "
"Regan: Frasier. "
"Frasier: Regan, hello. Er, listen, sorry about this afternoon. "
"Regan: Oh, forget about that, it was no big deal. By the way I was wondering if you'd be available to... "
"Frasier: Good Lord. "
"Frasier: No need to be embarrassed about that, I do that sort of thing all the time. You were saying? "
"Regan: Let me get all this cleaned up first. [look at Frasier for help] "
"Frasier: There you go. You know, I'd gladly have helped you, it's just that I've hurt my back you see. Oh, oh gosh, oh, oh, it's seizing up again. You know, maybe it would be best if I just went back inside, crawled into bed, good night. "
"to: Living Room "
"Frasier: It's going to be a moment. "
"Dinah: I figured. "
"Daphne: I'm just going to make us some tea. "
"Frasier: Back inside. "
"Mel: Frasier, you're a lucky man having this woman on your staff. Thank you again, Daphne. "
"Daphne: You're welcome. "
"Mel: Niles, where are you going with all that food? "
"Niles: Em... Dad is not feeling well, so I thought I'd bring him some comfort food. And, er, by the way, if anyone's going out, Dad specifically requested something called a chilupa. "
"Frasier: Er, Daphne, would you mind getting that? "
"Daphne: You're not serious? "
"Frasier: You are on the staff after all. "
"Regan: Hi, Daphne. "
"Daphne: Hey, Regan, come on in. "
"Regan: Em, oh, Frasier, I was concerned about your back. "
"Daphne: You hurt your back? "
"Frasier: No, no, it was just a spasm. See, leaning against the wall like this, it actually feels a lot better. "
"Mel: Is it upper back or lower? "
"Frasier: Middle. Actually, if you could all just leave me alone, really I'm fine just here. "
"Daphne: Why don't we just get you onto the couch? "
"Frasier: No, no, no, please, please, I know what I'm doing. "
"Regan: We'll each take a side. "
"Frasier: No, stop "
"Mel: Frasier, it could be a parasic strain. "
"Daphne: Or a bulging disc. "
"Regan: Yes, impinging on your lumbar nerves. "
"Frasier: Yes, it could easily be anyone of those things, but did you also consider that it might be... the stripper chained to my wrist "
"Daphne: Officer Nasty "
"Frasier: Everyone, this is Dinah. You see this all happened because I was trying to prove that I'm a normal guy, capable of doing normal guy things like throw a bachelor party - and Daphne, Donny didn't know anything about it so I wish you'd just lighten up. Regan, I can't even imagine where this must put us. I guess it's time I just accept the fact that things will never work out between us. You are certainly not to blame. After today, I can't see that any woman would even want to go out with me. "
"Dinah: I think I would. "
"TO: "
"Martin: Hey, Fras. "
"Frasier: Oh, hi, Dad. "
"Martin: How was your date? "
"Frasier: Well, it was nice. We had a beer, talked a bit... "
"Martin: She has a helluva body, doesn't she? "
"Frasier: Dad, that was not what this evening was about. This evening was about taking a chance, getting to know a different sort of woman. It turns out she's really quite interesting, Dinah. She's working her way through grad school, she lives with her mother, she's extremely well-read, she even speaks a couple of languages. "
"Martin: Well, it makes you wonder, doesn't it? "
"Frasier: Yes, it does, doesn't it? It makes you wonder how eager we are to judge a book by its cover, how willing we are to stereotype... "
"Martin: No, I mean, it really makes you wonder what that mother looks like "
