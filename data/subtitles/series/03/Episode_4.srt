1
00:00:17,367 --> 00:00:20,677
Oh, how does he always hear me?

2
00:00:20,677 --> 00:00:21,312
He doesn't.

3
00:00:21,312 --> 00:00:23,231
He just swings through every twenty minutes.

4
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:26,801
He knows you'll be eating some kind of junk.

5
00:00:26,801 --> 00:00:27,929
Well, I don't want him eating these.

6
00:00:27,929 --> 00:00:30,513
Well, then do what I do when
I want Eddie away from me.

7
00:00:30,513 --> 00:00:31,626
I make a sound like

8
00:00:31,626 --> 00:00:40,905
La la la la la la la la la la la!

9
00:00:40,905 --> 00:00:42,197
That's mean!

10
00:00:42,197 --> 00:00:44,248
Why?  It doesn't really hurt his ears.

11
00:00:44,248 --> 00:00:47,658
He just finds certain noises irritating.

12
00:00:58,804 --> 00:01:04,142
That was the most riveting production
of Wagner I have seen this season.

13
00:01:04,142 --> 00:01:08,215
I still have goose bumps from when Klingsor
summoned Kundry with

14
00:01:08,215 --> 00:01:11,430
a terrible cry and ordered her
to seduce Parsifal:

15
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:17,142
"Ha! Er Ist Shun Der Knabe!"

16
00:01:17,142 --> 00:01:19,046
Well, I had a pretty good night too.

17
00:01:19,046 --> 00:01:21,503
Took myself a nice, hot bath.

18
00:01:21,503 --> 00:01:24,462
And, remember that corn I had on my toe?

19
00:01:24,462 --> 00:01:30,952
Well, it got so soft I was just
able to peel it right off.

20
00:01:30,952 --> 00:01:33,080
Um... it's going to be difficult
for me to top that,

21
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,924
but I have some rather exciting news myself.

22
00:01:35,924 --> 00:01:38,972
I'm sure you're all familiar with
the Safford case that's been in the papers recently?

23
00:01:38,972 --> 00:01:42,942
Oh, you mean that scum-sucking jerk
who's trying to get his father committed?

24
00:01:42,942 --> 00:01:48,144
Yes.  Well, guess who's been retained
by that scum-sucking jerk!

25
00:01:48,144 --> 00:01:51,808
I'm going to be testifying as an expert
witness at Mr. Safford's capacity hearing.

26
00:01:51,808 --> 00:01:52,463
Wait a minute.

27
00:01:52,463 --> 00:01:55,342
You're gonna help sell that poor
old guy down the river?

28
00:01:55,342 --> 00:01:56,334
Not at all.

29
00:01:56,334 --> 00:01:57,895
Mr. Safford is unbalanced.

30
00:01:57,895 --> 00:01:59,460
His son is worried sick about him.

31
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:03,357
Oh, his son's worried he's not gonna
get his hands on his father's fortune.

32
00:02:03,357 --> 00:02:07,693
Boy, the minute a man starts getting
up there his kids start making plans to

33
00:02:07,693 --> 00:02:09,053
divvy up his stuff.

34
00:02:09,053 --> 00:02:11,176
Dad, you'll be pleased to know that Niles
and I have decided to give

35
00:02:11,176 --> 00:02:13,214
all your things to charity.

36
00:02:13,214 --> 00:02:17,935
We're donating your clothes to the blind.

37
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,068
Well, it's just not right.

38
00:02:22,068 --> 00:02:27,559
A bunch of moneygrubbers behind closed
doors trying to declare this poor old guy insane.

39
00:02:27,559 --> 00:02:29,877
For starters, it's not behind closed doors.

40
00:02:29,877 --> 00:02:32,820
The entire proceeding will be broadcast on Court TV.

41
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,413
Oh, great.

44
00:02:43,066 --> 00:02:46,637
Dad, I'm sure Niles is only doing
this to protect Mr. Safford from himself.

45
00:02:46,637 --> 00:02:48,910
Old age doesn't have to be that way, you know.

46
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:51,581
My great-aunt Beryl lived well into her nineties,

47
00:02:51,581 --> 00:02:54,060
and her mind never failed her.

48
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,686
Of course, she lost her eyesight in her seventies,

49
00:02:56,686 --> 00:02:59,061
and her balance in her eighties.

50
00:02:59,061 --> 00:03:01,308
By the end we spent most of our
time propping her up or

51
00:03:01,308 --> 00:03:04,590
putting another bandage on her forehead.

52
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:11,707
Oh, but bless her heart, she could
always tell you just how it happened.

53
00:03:11,707 --> 00:03:14,694
Well, Safford is clearly irrational.

54
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:16,130
Recently, he wandered off.

55
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:21,206
They found him two days later riding
across Wyoming in a boxcar full of bums;

56
00:03:21,206 --> 00:03:23,718
he's taken to selling off property
for half its worth;

57
00:03:23,718 --> 00:03:26,771
and most damning of all, when I went
over to evaluate him,

58
00:03:26,771 --> 00:03:30,949
he continually referred to me as "Sparky."

59
00:03:30,949 --> 00:03:34,291
I don't know, Niles, you always wanted
to have a nickname.

60
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:36,594
You remember your campaign to have
the string section

61
00:03:36,594 --> 00:03:39,971
of the youth orchestra call you "Rocky?"

62
00:03:39,971 --> 00:03:42,412
It would have worked, too, if Tilly
Farraday hadn't pinned me

63
00:03:42,412 --> 00:03:47,850
to the ground with her trombone when
I rebuked her for neglecting to clean her spit valve.

64
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:51,154
Well, I still think picking on
the old man stinks.

65
00:03:51,154 --> 00:03:54,593
God help you if you're over fifty
and you do anything that

66
00:03:54,593 --> 00:03:56,980
seems the least bit odd to your family.

67
00:04:12,179 --> 00:04:15,075
And I'm pretty sure he's having an
affair with his secretary.

68
00:04:15,075 --> 00:04:18,776
Well, have you talked to your husband
and heard his side of the story?

69
00:04:18,776 --> 00:04:19,522
No.

70
00:04:19,522 --> 00:04:22,347
Well, Beth, it does seem that your
fears may be well-founded,

71
00:04:22,347 --> 00:04:24,836
but I still think you should talk
to your husband before

72
00:04:24,836 --> 00:04:27,811
you come to any final conclusions.

73
00:04:27,811 --> 00:04:35,800
This is Dr. Frasier Crane, wishing
you good day, and good mental health.

74
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,272
Here are those PSAs, we'll do them
tomorrow before the show.

75
00:04:38,272 --> 00:04:42,420
Thank you, Roz.

76
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,570
Roz, why is that light still on?

77
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:46,276
Is that Beth who I was talking to?

78
00:04:46,276 --> 00:04:47,236
No!

79
00:04:47,236 --> 00:04:47,788
Yes, it is!

80
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:48,259
No, it isn't!

81
00:04:48,259 --> 00:04:48,659
Yes, it is!

82
00:04:48,659 --> 00:04:50,639
It is not!

83
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:51,325
Have you been talking to Beth?

84
00:04:51,325 --> 00:04:52,927
Of course not!

85
00:04:52,927 --> 00:04:55,445
What do you think - I'm giving
advice to your callers?

86
00:04:55,445 --> 00:04:57,607
Oh, Frasier, you are so paranoid.

87
00:04:57,607 --> 00:04:59,431
The world is full of enemies.

88
00:04:59,431 --> 00:05:01,093
Everybody's plotting against you.

89
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:02,971
There's a man in a dark trench coat
right behind you.

90
00:05:02,971 --> 00:05:05,358
Ho-ho, very droll.

91
00:05:05,358 --> 00:05:09,270
Dr. Crane?

92
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:10,038
I'm John Giroux.

93
00:05:10,038 --> 00:05:12,405
I work for Harlow Safford.

94
00:05:12,405 --> 00:05:14,053
Oh, Mr. Giroux, I'm afraid there's
been some mistake.

95
00:05:14,053 --> 00:05:15,820
It's my brother who's connected with the case.

96
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,941
Oh, we're quite aware of that,
but Mr. Safford feels

97
00:05:17,941 --> 00:05:20,092
he's the victim of a grave injustice.

98
00:05:20,092 --> 00:05:23,132
He's an ardent fan of your show and
feels you're the only man who can help him.

99
00:05:23,132 --> 00:05:25,844
Well, that's very flattering, but
given my brother's connection with the case,

100
00:05:25,844 --> 00:05:27,814
it wouldn't be very prudent
for me to get involved.

101
00:05:27,814 --> 00:05:31,396
Won't you at least talk to my client?
Judge him by his words and his actions,

102
00:05:31,396 --> 00:05:33,861
not by how old he is?

103
00:05:33,861 --> 00:05:40,917
You sound like my father - a man who
believes that burial is a form of age discrimination.

104
00:05:40,917 --> 00:05:42,113
If you stop by this evening,

105
00:05:42,113 --> 00:05:45,230
I'm convinced you'll find Mr. Safford
is completely competent.

106
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:48,229
Even if you won't testify on his behalf,
perhaps you could at least get your brother

107
00:05:48,229 --> 00:05:50,078
to reconsider his testimony.

108
00:05:50,078 --> 00:05:53,554
It's highly unlikely that I would
disagree with my brother's opinion.

109
00:05:53,554 --> 00:05:56,213
I really admired your advice to that
last caller - you know,

110
00:05:56,213 --> 00:06:01,826
about not judging someone until you've
heard his side of the story?

111
00:06:01,826 --> 00:06:03,933
You're a good lawyer, Mr. Giroux.

112
00:06:03,933 --> 00:06:07,740
Mr. Safford only seeks out the very best.

113
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,026
I'll see you at seven?

114
00:06:09,026 --> 00:06:11,141
The address is on the back of my card.

115
00:06:20,986 --> 00:06:22,476
I don't care what Dr. Crane said.

116
00:06:22,476 --> 00:06:25,941
You start talking to your husband 
and he'll start covering his tracks.

117
00:06:25,941 --> 00:06:36,211
Get a detective now.

118
00:06:36,211 --> 00:06:38,619
You were talking to my last caller.

119
00:06:38,619 --> 00:06:40,772
I swear; it's the first and last time.

120
00:06:40,772 --> 00:06:44,197
I will never do it again.

121
00:06:44,197 --> 00:06:51,836
I hope not.

122
00:06:51,836 --> 00:06:54,747
Thanks for holding, Bill.  I'm listening.

123
00:06:59,784 --> 00:07:01,114
Enjoy your tour?

124
00:07:01,114 --> 00:07:04,111
Uh... yes, yes.

125
00:07:04,111 --> 00:07:08,504
That's quite a model railroad Mr. Safford
has running through the grounds.

126
00:07:08,504 --> 00:07:10,849
I've never seen one on quite that scale.

127
00:07:10,849 --> 00:07:11,787
Impressive, isn't it?

128
00:07:11,787 --> 00:07:12,607
Oh, yes.  Yes,

129
00:07:12,607 --> 00:07:15,522
especially when it's bearing down on you.

130
00:07:15,522 --> 00:07:17,434
I got my heels stuck in the soft grass.

131
00:07:17,434 --> 00:07:20,792
I barely made the crossing.

132
00:07:20,792 --> 00:07:26,655
Tell me, how often does
Mr. Safford... play with his train?

133
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:31,637
Just the weekends, when he gives rides
to underprivileged children.

134
00:07:31,637 --> 00:07:33,400
Very admirable.

135
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,281
There's a lot you don't know about him, Dr. Crane.

136
00:07:35,281 --> 00:07:36,241
That's why you're here.

137
00:07:36,241 --> 00:07:45,553
Yes, well, I promise to consider
all the evidence before I arrive at a conclusion.

138
00:07:45,553 --> 00:07:48,193
I think I've arrived.

139
00:07:48,193 --> 00:07:49,330
Hiya, Sparky.

140
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:50,944
I'm Harlow Safford.

141
00:07:50,944 --> 00:07:53,179
Dr. Frasier Crane.

142
00:07:53,179 --> 00:07:56,127
I don't believe I've ever seen
a fire pole in a home before.

143
00:07:56,127 --> 00:07:58,443
Oh, it saves a lot of time.

144
00:07:58,443 --> 00:08:01,800
Except for going up, of course.

145
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,360
And, uh, the hat?

146
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,010
Oh, it's just for laughs.

147
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:06,833
Oh, try it on.

148
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:07,602
Well, no, I don't think I should.

149
00:08:07,602 --> 00:08:13,599
Oh, come on!

150
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:16,146
I guess it is sort of fun, isn't it?

151
00:08:16,146 --> 00:08:19,992
Not on you.

152
00:08:19,992 --> 00:08:24,239
So, do you think you can convince
my self-righteous son that I'm not nuts?

153
00:08:24,239 --> 00:08:26,793
Oh, I think "nuts" is a little strong.

154
00:08:26,793 --> 00:08:28,666
He must have meant that your behavior might seem to

155
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:30,607
most people to be a little unconventional.

156
00:08:30,607 --> 00:08:31,670
Well, good.

157
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:34,450
I've spent my whole life being conventional.

158
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:40,352
Then one day I said to myself, 
"Harlow, you're not having any fun."

159
00:08:40,352 --> 00:08:44,943
Do you... speak to yourself often?

160
00:08:44,943 --> 00:08:46,983
Don't try to trip me up, Sparky.

161
00:08:46,983 --> 00:08:47,688
Oh, no, thank you.

162
00:08:47,688 --> 00:08:50,273
Thank you, I'm trying to cut down on...

163
00:08:50,273 --> 00:08:55,374
lollipops.  Thank you.

164
00:08:55,374 --> 00:08:58,305
But tell me, why do you call people "Sparky"?

165
00:08:58,305 --> 00:09:02,506
It makes them smile.  Right, Sparky?

166
00:09:02,506 --> 00:09:03,895
You ought to try it with your patients.

167
00:09:03,895 --> 00:09:13,577
Oh, I'm not too sure how warmly
that would be embraced by those
undergoing electroshock.

168
00:09:13,577 --> 00:09:20,601
Um, anyway, your son tells me that
you recently sold some property at a
fraction of its value.

169
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:21,745
That's right.

170
00:09:21,745 --> 00:09:25,431
Terrific young married couple had
their hearts set on it, but couldn't afford it.

171
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:27,246
So, I helped them out.

172
00:09:27,246 --> 00:09:29,429
There's nothing wrong with helping people.

173
00:09:29,429 --> 00:09:34,670
Well, he also informed me that you
recently indulged in an unorthodox,

174
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:38,015
not to mention hazardous mode of travel.

175
00:09:38,015 --> 00:09:39,528
That pompous weenie.

176
00:09:39,528 --> 00:09:41,349
That's exactly how he would put it.

177
00:09:41,349 --> 00:09:44,597
Well, actually, that was my wording.

178
00:09:44,597 --> 00:09:46,668
Well, I hopped a freight.

179
00:09:46,668 --> 00:09:47,710
Rode the rails.

180
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:51,037
Well, why not just purchase a ticket
and ride in a club car?

181
00:09:51,037 --> 00:09:52,743
Where's the adventure in that?

182
00:09:52,743 --> 00:09:53,692
I'm 78.

183
00:09:53,692 --> 00:09:58,349
Someday I'll be too old to jump off
a moving train!

184
00:09:58,349 --> 00:10:00,656
No, you gotta live out your fantasies
while you can.

185
00:10:00,656 --> 00:10:04,101
Can you understand that?

186
00:10:04,101 --> 00:10:07,086
I think I can.

187
00:10:07,086 --> 00:10:12,220
Mr. Safford, what you've said makes
a great deal of sense.

188
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:18,030
Before we go on, there's something
I have to ask you.

189
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:20,119
Shoot.

190
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:22,023
It's a little embarrassing.

191
00:10:22,023 --> 00:10:23,997
I can take it.

192
00:10:23,997 --> 00:10:30,684
Okay.  Can I slide down that pole?

193
00:10:30,684 --> 00:10:32,596
Follow me, Sparky!

194
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:37,734
Dad, are you going to watch something now?

195
00:10:37,734 --> 00:10:39,742
Yeah, the championship fight.

196
00:10:39,742 --> 00:10:42,915
But don't worry, I'm using my earphones,
I won't bother anyone.

197
00:10:42,915 --> 00:10:47,398
Oh, you've already been a bother
- making me hide the sports section
so he won't see it.

198
00:10:47,398 --> 00:10:50,581
Making me turn the news off because
they might say who won.

199
00:10:50,581 --> 00:10:51,734
I don't understand.

200
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,364
Well, the fight was last night.

201
00:10:53,364 --> 00:10:55,091
It was on Pay TV.

202
00:10:55,091 --> 00:10:57,583
But one of my police buddies has
a pirate antenna.

203
00:10:57,583 --> 00:11:03,708
So, he taped it and they messengered
one to me in an envelope marked "Official Business."

204
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:09,646
Another inspiring tale of our men
in law enforcement.

205
00:11:09,646 --> 00:11:11,095
Why are you walking funny?

206
00:11:11,095 --> 00:11:15,046
Well, suffice it to say I learned today
it is unwise to slide repeatedly down

207
00:11:15,046 --> 00:11:21,206
a fire pole wearing woolen trousers.

208
00:11:21,206 --> 00:11:22,148
Daphne, would you...?

209
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:26,964
Oh, I'll get it.

210
00:11:26,964 --> 00:11:28,005
Evening, Daphne.

211
00:11:28,005 --> 00:11:31,628
Oh, Dr. Crane, don't say anything
about last night's boxing match.

212
00:11:31,628 --> 00:11:33,622
Your dad hasn't seen it yet.

213
00:11:33,622 --> 00:11:44,954
Oh, I didn't even know it was boxing season.

214
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:47,706
Well, did everyone see my mention
in this morning's paper?

215
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:48,603
No, I'm afraid I missed that.

216
00:11:48,603 --> 00:11:50,522
Well, small wonder.

217
00:11:50,522 --> 00:11:53,092
They buried it all the way back on page 32.

218
00:11:53,092 --> 00:11:54,900
It's here, it's next to the sports section.

219
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:59,805
Hey, get that out of here!

220
00:11:59,805 --> 00:12:00,620
Let me see.

221
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:01,077
It's right there.

222
00:12:01,077 --> 00:12:02,092
Oh.

223
00:12:02,092 --> 00:12:05,996
"Court TV this week will feature
the capacity hearing of noted

224
00:12:05,996 --> 00:12:08,244
timber baron Harlow Safford. [

225
00:12:08,244 --> 00:12:12,251
Testifying on behalf of the family
will be Dr. Niles Crane,

226
00:12:12,251 --> 00:12:17,860
eminent psychiatrist, author and
leading authority on clinical psychosis.

227
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,691
Dr. Crane is also the brother of..."

228
00:12:19,691 --> 00:12:24,393
Yadda-yadda, the rest is filler.

229
00:12:24,393 --> 00:12:28,844
Niles, I have to talk to you about something.

230
00:12:28,844 --> 00:12:33,307
Just after the show today I was
visited by a man named Mr. Giroux.

231
00:12:33,307 --> 00:12:36,149
He asked me to represent Mr. Safford.

232
00:12:36,149 --> 00:12:37,036
What?!

233
00:12:37,036 --> 00:12:39,660
Shh!

234
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:40,473
I'm sorry.

235
00:12:40,473 --> 00:12:42,658
Given your involvement with the case,
I naturally declined.

236
00:12:42,658 --> 00:12:43,953
Oh, thank God.

237
00:12:43,953 --> 00:12:48,617
But, I did agree to see if I concurred
with your analysis and speak to Mr. Safford.

238
00:12:48,617 --> 00:12:49,556
What?!

239
00:12:49,556 --> 00:12:51,952
Hey, keep it down!

240
00:12:51,952 --> 00:12:57,321
I just have to tell you that I found
Harlow Safford to be of completely sound mind -

241
00:12:57,321 --> 00:12:59,507
and don't say "What?!"

242
00:12:59,507 --> 00:13:00,185
Why?!

243
00:13:00,185 --> 00:13:04,272
Quiet!!

244
00:13:04,272 --> 00:13:07,256
Perhaps it'd be better if we spoke
somewhere else.

245
00:13:11,812 --> 00:13:14,121
You couldn't stand that I had a
high-profile case, could you?

246
00:13:14,121 --> 00:13:15,476
So you had to butt into it!

247
00:13:15,476 --> 00:13:16,843
I just don't want you to make a fool of yourself.

248
00:13:16,843 --> 00:13:18,969
These people came to me, they
asked for my expertise.

249
00:13:18,969 --> 00:13:22,929
Oh, ha!  They were undoubtedly
exploiting your dubious celebrity.

250
00:13:22,929 --> 00:13:26,232
Of which you are jealous and, I fear,
the reason you took this case!

251
00:13:26,232 --> 00:13:27,689
That is flatly untrue!

252
00:13:27,689 --> 00:13:29,100
I took the case to help the family!

253
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,179
And to be on television!

254
00:13:30,179 --> 00:13:31,737
I don't give a hoot about television!

255
00:13:31,737 --> 00:13:38,083
Well, some of us do!!

256
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:41,664
Niles, you made a hasty judgment
and I am sorry, but you were wrong.

257
00:13:41,664 --> 00:13:44,184
Ah, now we see why you got involved in the case -

258
00:13:44,184 --> 00:13:47,358
so big brother could be right and
little Niles could be wrong, which I'm not!

259
00:13:47,358 --> 00:13:51,124
Oh, your pathetic childhood issues
have nothing to do with it.

260
00:13:51,124 --> 00:13:53,880
Face it, you were wrong!  Wrong, wrong, wrong!

261
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:58,458
Oh, oh, oh-!

262
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:03,122
This from Mr. Quick-Fix, the master
of the in-depth, one-minute phone call diagnosis!

263
00:14:03,122 --> 00:14:05,738
I spent several hours with Mr. Safford 
and I found his behavior to be...

264
00:14:05,738 --> 00:14:06,752
Wildly irrational.

265
00:14:06,752 --> 00:14:07,978
He's a lip-diddling loon!

266
00:14:07,978 --> 00:14:11,018
You think anything that's even slightly
spontaneous is aberrant.

267
00:14:11,018 --> 00:14:12,147
That's ridiculous!

268
00:14:12,147 --> 00:14:13,745
The man's incompetent!

269
00:14:13,745 --> 00:14:15,402
Niles, I'm warning you.

270
00:14:15,402 --> 00:14:18,898
If you get up in that courtroom and
say that, you will damage yourself professionally!

271
00:14:18,898 --> 00:14:21,041
I'm testifying, and you're not going to stop me!

272
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:23,672
Fine, then you leave me no choice
but to testify against you!

273
00:14:23,672 --> 00:14:25,335
Well, in that case, I'll see you in court!

274
00:14:25,335 --> 00:14:26,406
Good, I look forward to it!

275
00:14:26,406 --> 00:14:27,017
So do I!

276
00:14:27,017 --> 00:14:27,490
Good!

277
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:28,216
Good!

278
00:14:28,216 --> 00:14:31,210
HEY!!

279
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:33,574
Daphne, please.  Turn down that radio.

280
00:14:33,574 --> 00:14:36,541
Dad is trying to watch a fight!

281
00:14:41,831 --> 00:14:42,953
So, how are you holding up?

282
00:14:42,953 --> 00:14:45,703
Oh, I'm fine.  Now look, Sparky.

283
00:14:45,703 --> 00:14:48,166
I know you don't want to take any
money for helping me.

284
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:51,831
But at least let me make a donation
to your favorite charity.

285
00:14:51,831 --> 00:14:57,813
Well... it was my duty, not to 
mention a pleasure, to help you.

286
00:14:57,813 --> 00:15:02,841
But if you'd like to donate something,
why don't youselect a charity of your own choosing?

287
00:15:02,841 --> 00:15:03,992
Fair enough.

288
00:15:03,992 --> 00:15:12,576
Good.  Excuse me.

289
00:15:12,576 --> 00:15:14,145
Hello, Niles.

290
00:15:14,145 --> 00:15:16,437
You know, it's not to late to ask 
them to put a big blue ball in front of

291
00:15:16,437 --> 00:15:19,976
your face during the broadcast.

292
00:15:19,976 --> 00:15:23,733
Perhaps spare you some shred of your reputation.

293
00:15:23,733 --> 00:15:28,598
I'd laugh in your face but I'm saving my voice.

294
00:15:28,598 --> 00:15:33,604
Oh my God!  You're wearing makeup!

295
00:15:33,604 --> 00:15:34,940
I am not!

296
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:38,277
This is... medication.

297
00:15:38,277 --> 00:15:40,565
Something my dermatologist recommended.

298
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:45,614
Dr. Revlon?

299
00:15:45,614 --> 00:15:48,910
These feeble attempts to undermine
my confidence are futile.

300
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:51,572
The testimony I've prepared is
nothing short of brilliant.

301
00:15:51,572 --> 00:15:53,484
I cite half a dozen studies of gerontology.

302
00:15:53,484 --> 00:15:55,926
I quote everything from the Bible to Herodotus.

303
00:15:55,926 --> 00:15:58,044
I deftly interweave humor with pathos.

304
00:15:58,044 --> 00:16:01,094
You may want to take notes.

305
00:16:01,094 --> 00:16:04,483
And if you had an ounce of self-awareness
you would realize

306
00:16:04,483 --> 00:16:10,897
that your diagnosis was colored by
your zeal to put your face in front of that camera.

307
00:16:10,897 --> 00:16:12,515
Oh, by the way,

308
00:16:12,515 --> 00:16:20,879
your medication is rubbing off on your collar.

309
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:22,102
All rise.

310
00:16:22,102 --> 00:16:22,708
Court is in session.

311
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:24,645
Judge Richard McCarron presiding.

312
00:16:24,645 --> 00:16:28,415
Hello, your honor.

313
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:30,302
Be seated.

314
00:16:30,302 --> 00:16:31,651
Good morning.

315
00:16:31,651 --> 00:16:32,991
Has everyone been sworn in?

316
00:16:32,991 --> 00:16:34,606
Yes, your honor.

317
00:16:34,606 --> 00:16:40,462
Well, I see we have two Dr. Cranes testifying today.

318
00:16:40,462 --> 00:16:46,510
Mr. Giroux, I think we'll hear from 
your authority first.

319
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:50,892
I assume the other Dr. Crane has no
objection to that arrangement?

320
00:16:50,892 --> 00:16:53,402
None whatsoever, your honor.

321
00:16:53,402 --> 00:16:56,926
I'm over here, Dr. Crane.

322
00:16:56,926 --> 00:16:59,597
Your honor, I would not presume to bore the court with a

323
00:16:59,597 --> 00:17:09,268
recitation of dry statistics,
gerontology studies, obscure literary references.

324
00:17:09,268 --> 00:17:15,715
Instead, I intend to speak from the heart.

325
00:17:15,715 --> 00:17:19,561
I worry about a society that has
chosen to define normalcy in such narrow

326
00:17:19,561 --> 00:17:23,446
terms that if someone's behavior
deviates ever so slightly,

327
00:17:23,446 --> 00:17:27,567
we question his capacity to function.

328
00:17:27,567 --> 00:17:32,536
Mr. Safford's seeming eccentricities -
his love of trains, his generosity -

329
00:17:32,536 --> 00:17:34,302
they can all be readily explained.

330
00:17:34,302 --> 00:17:36,655
Diabetes!

331
00:17:36,655 --> 00:17:37,889
Mr. Safford?

332
00:17:37,889 --> 00:17:42,629
I was talking to Sparky.

333
00:17:42,629 --> 00:17:43,910
Uh... Did you say diabetes?

334
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:46,966
Yes.  We'll donate the money to diabetes.

335
00:17:46,966 --> 00:17:49,887
Those poor people can't eat sugar!

336
00:17:49,887 --> 00:17:51,310
Fine.. fine.

337
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:52,985
Uh... we'll, uh... we'll talk
about it afterwards.

338
00:17:52,985 --> 00:17:55,855
May we continue, Dr. Crane?

339
00:17:55,855 --> 00:17:57,071
My apologies, your honor.

340
00:17:57,071 --> 00:17:59,824
Mr. Safford and I were discussing
a very sizable donation he intends

341
00:17:59,824 --> 00:18:03,800
to make later today to a very worthy cause.

342
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,184
I guess his enthusiasm just got the best of him.

343
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:09,902
But, it is this very generosity that
his son finds so objectionable.

344
00:18:09,902 --> 00:18:14,623
That, and the fact that he did hop
a freight train across the country.

345
00:18:14,623 --> 00:18:22,117
But, you see, what he sees as unstable,
I see as... romantic.

346
00:18:22,117 --> 00:18:26,653
I... I don't suppose there's a railroad
track outside the courtroom?

347
00:18:34,803 --> 00:18:38,998
Uh... doesn't Mr. Safford deserve to be
a bit of a free spirit

348
00:18:38,998 --> 00:18:42,182
after the years of his demanding career?

349
00:18:42,182 --> 00:18:46,325
A career in which he wore...

350
00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:50,981
many hats.

351
00:18:50,981 --> 00:18:55,308
Um... the hat of a father,
a philanthropist, a C.E.O...

352
00:18:55,308 --> 00:18:57,045
All aboard!  All aboard!

353
00:18:57,045 --> 00:18:58,580
Get your tickets ready.

354
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:00,095
Have your tickets ready, please.

355
00:19:00,095 --> 00:19:01,997
Have your tickets ready.

356
00:19:01,997 --> 00:19:03,278
In the end, it all comes down to this:

357
00:19:03,278 --> 00:19:06,310
can we really condemn a man for maintaining a childlike

358
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:10,196
joie de vivre even in his twilight years?

359
00:19:10,196 --> 00:19:12,230
All aboard for the Coast Express.

360
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:16,421
Yes, making stops in Tacoma, Olympia,
Portland and Salem.

361
00:19:16,421 --> 00:19:17,706
And the next stop is...

362
00:19:17,706 --> 00:19:20,491
I think I know where your next stop is going to be.

363
00:19:31,267 --> 00:19:35,946
Now, look, Niles.  Before you start
gloating, let me just say this.

364
00:19:35,946 --> 00:19:38,013
You were right, I was wrong.

365
00:19:38,013 --> 00:19:39,972
Big deal.

366
00:19:39,972 --> 00:19:43,739
The world never got a chance to hear me be right.

367
00:19:43,739 --> 00:19:46,636
I suppose by now it's obvious that
what you were saying all along was true.

368
00:19:46,636 --> 00:19:49,805
I do... envy your fame.

369
00:19:49,805 --> 00:19:54,177
Well, perhaps this public humiliation
will cure me of my damned competitiveness.

370
00:19:54,177 --> 00:19:58,042
Oh, don't worry about it.

371
00:19:58,042 --> 00:20:00,820
I humiliated myself far more than you did today.

372
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:05,200
Obviously, you didn't see the way
I was whoring after that TV camera.

373
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,986
Obviously, you didn't see how I was
tap dancing up there like an organ grinder's monkey.

374
00:20:09,986 --> 00:20:12,823
Yes, well, I might as well have been
tarred and feathered.

375
00:20:12,823 --> 00:20:15,010
I might as well have been pilloried
in the town square.

376
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:17,240
I might as well have been stripped
naked and forced to...

377
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:21,441
Oh, stop it, Niles!  We're doing it again!

378
00:20:21,441 --> 00:20:25,144
Niles, you have no reason to feel badly.

379
00:20:25,144 --> 00:20:29,607
Everyone wants to be recognized for
something they're good at.

380
00:20:29,607 --> 00:20:35,662
And you are a good psychiatrist.

381
00:20:35,662 --> 00:20:37,366
Thank you, Frasier.

382
00:20:37,366 --> 00:20:41,040
Something I can't really lay claim 
to after today.

383
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,903
How could I have so misjudged that man?

384
00:20:42,903 --> 00:20:46,526
Well, he's undeniably charming for one thing.

385
00:20:46,526 --> 00:20:49,038
And he can be lucid for long stretches of time.

386
00:20:49,038 --> 00:20:51,068
Yes, but you weren't fooled.

387
00:20:51,068 --> 00:20:56,150
Somehow, you picked up on some tiny
clue that I missed.

388
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:58,199
You remember what it was?

389
00:20:58,199 --> 00:21:01,636
Yes.  Midway through our interview
he took off his trousers

390
00:21:01,636 --> 00:21:07,271
and tried to put them on the cat.

391
00:21:07,271 --> 00:21:12,072
Well, I'd like to think that I might
have picked up on that one too.  Still...

392
00:21:12,072 --> 00:21:15,765
Frasier, you've always approached 
life with a positive attitude.

393
00:21:15,765 --> 00:21:17,904
It's a quality I admire of yours.

394
00:21:17,904 --> 00:21:22,189
Perhaps your judgment was clouded
by your desire to see old age not as a

395
00:21:22,189 --> 00:21:27,950
time of inevitable decline, but as 
a time when one's childhood passions

396
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:32,277
and fantasies can be reborn.

397
00:21:32,277 --> 00:21:35,766
Thank you, Niles.

398
00:21:35,766 --> 00:21:37,095
You know what would cheer me up right now?

399
00:21:37,095 --> 00:21:37,883
What?

400
00:21:37,883 --> 00:21:40,671
I would like to hear that summation
you never got a chance to give.

401
00:21:40,671 --> 00:21:41,235
Really?

402
00:21:41,235 --> 00:21:41,751
Yes.

403
00:21:41,751 --> 00:21:42,607
You're not just saying that?

404
00:21:42,607 --> 00:21:43,307
Do you care?

405
00:21:43,307 --> 00:21:43,918
No!

406
00:21:43,918 --> 00:21:46,908
Well, all right then.

407
00:21:46,908 --> 00:21:48,132
I'm the judge!  I'm the judge!

408
00:21:48,132 --> 00:21:49,372
Okay, you be the judge.

409
00:21:49,372 --> 00:21:50,402
All rise.

410
00:21:50,402 --> 00:21:50,960
Yes, here we are.

411
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,797
Have we been sworn in?

412
00:21:51,797 --> 00:21:56,446
Yes we have, your honor.

413
00:21:56,446 --> 00:21:57,822
Dr. Crane, proceed.

414
00:21:57,822 --> 00:22:00,403
Your honor, I believe it was Herodotus who said:

415
00:22:00,403 --> 00:22:06,427
"Circumstances rule men.
Men do not rule circumstances."
