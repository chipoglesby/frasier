1
00:00:25,338 --> 00:00:27,072
You got something on your mind?

2
00:00:27,072 --> 00:00:28,081
It's Joe.

3
00:00:28,081 --> 00:00:29,866
Tonight's our six-month anniversary,

4
00:00:29,866 --> 00:00:31,787
but we can't celebrate until next week

5
00:00:31,787 --> 00:00:33,489
because he's flying to Las Vegas

6
00:00:33,489 --> 00:00:34,537
with his buddies.

7
00:00:34,537 --> 00:00:35,954
Oh, Vegas, huh?

8
00:00:35,954 --> 00:00:36,648
Great!

9
00:00:36,648 --> 00:00:37,684
Well, tell him not to miss the show

10
00:00:37,684 --> 00:00:39,057
at the Diamond Lounge:

11
00:00:39,057 --> 00:00:42,393
a Topless History of the World!

12
00:00:42,393 --> 00:00:44,025
If they've still got the same Bathsheeba

13
00:00:44,025 --> 00:00:46,217
he's in for a real treat!

14
00:00:46,217 --> 00:00:46,735
Oh yes,

15
00:00:46,735 --> 00:00:49,483
that's just where I want Joe
spending our anniversary,

16
00:00:49,483 --> 00:00:51,577
some smutty show in Vegas!

17
00:00:51,577 --> 00:00:54,945
No, it's very tasteful and 
historically accurate.

18
00:00:54,945 --> 00:00:56,835
Except at the end, where Eleanor Roosevelt

19
00:00:56,835 --> 00:01:05,010
and Eva Braun settle World War Two
by wrestling in pudding.

20
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:05,951
Hello, Dr. Crane.

21
00:01:05,951 --> 00:01:06,704
Daphne.

22
00:01:06,704 --> 00:01:07,225
Oh, Niles.

23
00:01:07,225 --> 00:01:08,354
To what do we owe this pleasure?

24
00:01:08,354 --> 00:01:11,326
To an unscrupulous art dealer
who's trying to rob me blind.

25
00:01:11,326 --> 00:01:13,069
Last night, I was at a gallery opening, and

26
00:01:13,069 --> 00:01:15,251
Niles, is this going to be a long story?

27
00:01:15,251 --> 00:01:16,079
Moderately.

28
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:19,174
Walk-and-talk.

29
00:01:19,174 --> 00:01:20,845
Anyway, I was at this opening, 
in conversation,

30
00:01:20,845 --> 00:01:24,139
when I made a rather emphatic 
point about pointillism,

31
00:01:24,139 --> 00:01:26,116
when I lost the grip on my canap and found that

32
00:01:26,116 --> 00:01:27,403
it became airborne!

33
00:01:27,403 --> 00:01:30,243
Well, the next thing I know 
I'm being confronted by

34
00:01:30,243 --> 00:01:31,973
an irate gallery owner who's demanding

35
00:01:31,973 --> 00:01:35,326
I reimburse him for the damage 
to one of his paintings!

36
00:01:35,326 --> 00:01:37,204
How he could notice a fleck of foie gras on a

37
00:01:37,204 --> 00:01:40,782
Jackson Pollock is beyond me.

38
00:01:40,782 --> 00:01:41,495
He's getting an estimate,

39
00:01:41,495 --> 00:01:42,423
and just to protect myself,

40
00:01:42,423 --> 00:01:44,924
I seem to recall you knowing a 
trustworthy art restorer?

41
00:01:44,924 --> 00:01:46,365
Oh yes, I do, actually.

44
00:01:50,192 --> 00:01:50,965
I'll get you his card.

45
00:01:50,965 --> 00:01:53,424
Oh, thank you.

46
00:01:53,424 --> 00:01:54,333
You free for lunch today?

47
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:55,680
Oh, sadly, no.

48
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,008
The radio station is subjecting my program

49
00:01:58,008 --> 00:02:02,149
to something they call a 
"focus group" this afternoon.

50
00:02:02,149 --> 00:02:02,915
Dinner, perhaps?

51
00:02:02,915 --> 00:02:03,919
Oh, perfect.

52
00:02:03,919 --> 00:02:05,662
And what exactly is a focus group?

53
00:02:05,662 --> 00:02:09,071
Well, they actually drag a pack 
of people off the street and

54
00:02:09,071 --> 00:02:10,023
make them listen to my program,

55
00:02:10,023 --> 00:02:12,054
and then dutifully record 
their opinions about it.

56
00:02:12,054 --> 00:02:12,959
How demeaning!

57
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,076
Oh, absolutely.

58
00:02:14,076 --> 00:02:15,575
Can you imagine Sigmund Freud being dragged

59
00:02:15,575 --> 00:02:17,908
into a roomful of Viennese 
laymen to hear remarks like,

60
00:02:17,908 --> 00:02:21,524
"hate that Oedipal thing, but, 
oh, love the penis envy!"

61
00:02:21,524 --> 00:02:23,598
I mean, really!

62
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:25,007
The worst thing is that they may change

63
00:02:25,007 --> 00:02:28,619
my show in deference to the 
opinion of Joe Six-Pack!

64
00:02:28,619 --> 00:02:29,596
You're worrying too much.

65
00:02:29,596 --> 00:02:31,799
I was on a focus group once.

66
00:02:31,799 --> 00:02:38,045
That sound you hear is a nail 
being hammered into my coffin.

67
00:02:38,045 --> 00:02:39,945
They were trying out a new frozen snack.

68
00:02:39,945 --> 00:02:46,781
It was a meatball with the cheese 
injected right in the middle.

69
00:02:46,781 --> 00:02:53,835
Just as nature intended.

70
00:02:53,835 --> 00:02:56,182
Dr. Niles Crane.  Ah.

71
00:02:56,182 --> 00:02:58,988
So, you have the estimate?

72
00:02:58,988 --> 00:03:00,421
What?

73
00:03:00,421 --> 00:03:07,437
Four thousand dollars, to remove 
a miniscule gobbet of duck liver?!

74
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:10,724
I could do the same thing with a
Q-tip and some club seltzer!

75
00:03:10,724 --> 00:03:12,774
Oh well, you may very well 
say "pay up or else,"

76
00:03:12,774 --> 00:03:15,428
but I have something to say to you?

77
00:03:15,428 --> 00:03:18,527
Yeah, well at least I wasn't 
fooling around with the babysitter!

78
00:03:18,527 --> 00:03:19,240
Shut up!

79
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,776
No, you shut up!

80
00:03:20,776 --> 00:03:23,292
Oh please, I have enough aggravation 
without having to listen

81
00:03:23,292 --> 00:03:24,974
to a stupid talk show!

82
00:03:24,974 --> 00:03:27,308
I swear, the only life forms 
lower than the people

83
00:03:27,308 --> 00:03:30,586
who appear on those shows are 
the ones who watch them!

84
00:03:30,586 --> 00:03:31,659
Like me?

85
00:03:31,659 --> 00:03:32,634
What?

86
00:03:32,634 --> 00:03:34,236
Oh no, I didn't realize?

87
00:03:34,236 --> 00:03:36,805
No, no, no, that's quite all right.

88
00:03:36,805 --> 00:03:38,862
Although I do find it interesting that

89
00:03:38,862 --> 00:03:41,411
I get criticized for listening 
to people's problems,

90
00:03:41,411 --> 00:03:44,141
when all you do is get rich from it.

91
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:45,550
Surely, Daphne, even you can see 
the difference between cheap

92
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:48,399
sensationalism and the practice of psychiatry.

93
00:03:48,399 --> 00:03:50,508
Oh, "even me?"

94
00:03:50,508 --> 00:03:52,796
As in, "even feeble-minded Daphne?!"

95
00:03:52,796 --> 00:03:54,812
Well, I'll tell you what I can 
tell the difference between:

96
00:03:54,812 --> 00:03:57,837
a true gentleman and a condescending prig!

97
00:03:57,837 --> 00:04:00,659
I... am NOT!

98
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:04,244
He said priggishly.

99
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,381
Forgive me if I'm not as down to earth

100
00:04:06,381 --> 00:04:10,300
as you and your tattooed, muu-muu wearing brethren!

101
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,685
You pompous twit!

102
00:04:11,685 --> 00:04:12,715
Couch zombie!

103
00:04:12,715 --> 00:04:13,659
Snob!

104
00:04:13,659 --> 00:04:14,290
Brat!

105
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:15,042
Oh, shut up!

106
00:04:15,042 --> 00:04:16,841
No, YOU shut up!

107
00:04:16,841 --> 00:04:22,002
I'm glad we turned off the TV.

108
00:04:22,002 --> 00:04:25,012
Oh, Dr. Crane, I'm so sorry!

109
00:04:25,012 --> 00:04:26,467
I'm just so upset at Joe!

110
00:04:26,467 --> 00:04:27,779
I didn't mean a word of it!

111
00:04:27,779 --> 00:04:28,603
Daphne, I apologize?

112
00:04:28,603 --> 00:04:30,961
Oh no, it was my fault?

113
00:04:30,961 --> 00:04:31,779
I called you a couch zombie?

114
00:04:31,779 --> 00:04:34,141
No, please?

115
00:04:34,141 --> 00:04:34,940
Friends?

116
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:42,995
Oh, of course.

117
00:04:42,995 --> 00:04:44,800
Niles, what was that all about?

118
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,594
I'm not sure.

119
00:04:45,594 --> 00:04:52,500
But, oh, mama, it was glorious!

120
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,946
Blood-pounding, sarcastic zingers flying!

121
00:04:55,946 --> 00:04:58,259
Are you saying you that enjoyed 
fighting with Daphne?

122
00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:00,237
Every exhilarating moment!

123
00:05:00,237 --> 00:05:01,949
It was pure, unbridled passion!

124
00:05:01,949 --> 00:05:09,172
I think I still have some of her 
spittle on my forehead!

125
00:05:09,172 --> 00:05:12,060
Oh, why did Dad ever tell us 
not to fight with girls?

126
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,292
It's wonderful!

127
00:05:14,292 --> 00:05:15,654
The friction between us?

128
00:05:15,654 --> 00:05:17,489
Niles, is this going to be a long description?

129
00:05:17,489 --> 00:05:18,281
Very!

130
00:05:18,281 --> 00:05:20,654
Walk-and-talk.

131
00:05:28,101 --> 00:05:30,153
By showering a reluctant girlfriend with gifts,

132
00:05:30,153 --> 00:05:33,425
Billy, you're applying a band-aid 
to a gaping wound.

133
00:05:33,425 --> 00:05:34,371
My advice is to find someone

134
00:05:34,371 --> 00:05:35,800
who will return your worthy affection,

135
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:41,137
or your wallet, as well as your
bed, will be empty.

136
00:05:41,137 --> 00:05:42,210
I see we're out of time.

137
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:43,251
Thank you for listening.

138
00:05:43,251 --> 00:05:48,020
This is Dr. Frasier Crane, wishing 
you all good mental health.

139
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:51,545
OK, let's talk about Dr. Crane's show.

140
00:05:51,545 --> 00:05:53,650
Oh, I know you've been eyeing this two-way mirror,

141
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:56,131
but the other people behind 
there are data consultants,

142
00:05:56,131 --> 00:05:57,849
so please speak freely.

143
00:05:57,849 --> 00:06:00,340
There's no one involved with the 
show whose feelings could be hurt.

144
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:03,771
If anybody says anything bad 
about me, I'll kill myself!

145
00:06:03,771 --> 00:06:04,931
Now, Roz, relax.

146
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:06,072
We do a perfectly good show.

147
00:06:06,072 --> 00:06:07,864
We're not going to change it one iota.

148
00:06:07,864 --> 00:06:10,730
Only a fool would listen to the 
opinion of every Tom, Dick, and Harry.

149
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:12,548
I liked everything about it.

150
00:06:12,548 --> 00:06:15,539
On the other hand, it's good 
to keep an open mind.

151
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:16,771
I like that Roz.

152
00:06:16,771 --> 00:06:19,161
I think her voice is really sexy,

153
00:06:19,161 --> 00:06:21,804
especially that throaty laugh of hers.

154
00:06:21,804 --> 00:06:23,255
Wow, that's nice.

155
00:06:23,255 --> 00:06:25,359
I didn't know I had a throaty laugh.

156
00:06:25,359 --> 00:06:26,115
You do.

157
00:06:26,115 --> 00:06:27,715
I've noticed it too.

158
00:06:27,715 --> 00:06:35,192
Really? Oh, you.

159
00:06:35,192 --> 00:06:38,183
The stuff he says really seems 
to make a lot of sense.

160
00:06:38,183 --> 00:06:39,602
Yeah, it's funny.

161
00:06:39,602 --> 00:06:41,024
I mean, he takes his callers seriously,

162
00:06:41,024 --> 00:06:42,794
but he can kid around with them too.

163
00:06:42,794 --> 00:06:44,481
Yeah, I listen to a lot of radio,

164
00:06:44,481 --> 00:06:48,306
and I think this is a great show.

165
00:06:48,306 --> 00:06:53,110
Well, I just don't know how much 
more of this I can listen to!

166
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:55,486
Manu, I notice you've been quiet.

167
00:06:55,486 --> 00:06:57,049
Uh, do you have something to say?

168
00:06:57,049 --> 00:07:00,585
Me?  No.

169
00:07:00,585 --> 00:07:03,878
We'd like to hear your opinion of the program.

170
00:07:03,878 --> 00:07:06,526
Well, it... I don't know.

171
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:14,408
Something about... I don't like it.

172
00:07:14,408 --> 00:07:19,521
Well, who is this cheeky nonconformist?

173
00:07:19,521 --> 00:07:22,514
Well, let's see, his name is Manu Habib, married,

174
00:07:22,514 --> 00:07:25,296
no children, owns his own newsstand.

175
00:07:25,296 --> 00:07:29,865
Wow, that is so weird, to hear 
someone's whole life summed up like that.

176
00:07:29,865 --> 00:07:38,495
"Roz Doyle, Radio Producer, single."

177
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:40,926
Well, getting back to your thoughts, Manu,

178
00:07:40,926 --> 00:07:43,533
you said there was something about 
the program you didn't like.

179
00:07:43,533 --> 00:07:47,713
Can you be more specific.

180
00:07:47,713 --> 00:07:51,703
I don't like him.

181
00:07:51,703 --> 00:07:53,168
Why?

182
00:07:53,168 --> 00:07:54,015
I don't know.

183
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:56,205
I just don't like him.

184
00:07:56,205 --> 00:07:56,792
Oh, I do.

185
00:07:56,792 --> 00:07:58,102
I'm gonna start listening to him all the time.

186
00:07:58,102 --> 00:08:01,998
It's a great show.

187
00:08:01,998 --> 00:08:04,381
My God, Frasier, this is a love-fest!

188
00:08:04,381 --> 00:08:06,330
I can't believe we were even worried about it.

189
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:10,467
"I just don't like him."  Hmm...

190
00:08:10,467 --> 00:08:11,612
Well, looks like our coffee's here.

191
00:08:11,612 --> 00:08:14,742
Why don't we take a quick break, OK?

192
00:08:14,742 --> 00:08:15,666
Hey, sports fans!

193
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:16,741
How's it going in here?

194
00:08:16,741 --> 00:08:18,726
Bulldog, I thought they were 
testing your show across the hall?

195
00:08:18,726 --> 00:08:19,941
Oh, yeah, they are.

196
00:08:19,941 --> 00:08:22,306
But after ten minutes it's 
just the same-old, same-old.

197
00:08:22,306 --> 00:08:25,287
Guys love me, chicks pretend not to.

198
00:08:25,287 --> 00:08:29,875
Whoa, your group's even uglier than mine!

199
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:30,940
Would you knock it off?

200
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,084
These people happen to like us.

201
00:08:32,084 --> 00:08:32,950
Oh, will you guys lighten up?

202
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:34,830
You got to get in the spirit of things.

203
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:35,875
Hey, hey!

204
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:40,454
This is great, I live for a moment like this.

205
00:08:40,454 --> 00:08:41,340
That's right, that's right,

206
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:43,178
go for it, right there, right there.

207
00:08:43,178 --> 00:08:44,637
Bulldog?

208
00:08:44,637 --> 00:08:46,594
As long as you're in there 
you might as well go after the

209
00:08:46,594 --> 00:08:48,436
Huevos Rancheros you had for breakfast!

210
00:08:48,436 --> 00:08:49,652
Oh, stop it!

211
00:08:49,652 --> 00:08:51,659
Hey, ten bucks says he eats what he finds.

212
00:08:51,659 --> 00:08:52,531
Oh, that's disgusting!

213
00:08:52,531 --> 00:08:55,931
Come on, come on, come on, come o

214
00:08:55,931 --> 00:08:58,226
BINGO!

215
00:08:58,226 --> 00:09:03,024
Do I know these people or what?!

216
00:09:05,325 --> 00:09:05,833
Hi, Niles.

217
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:07,178
Hey, Dad.

218
00:09:07,178 --> 00:09:09,217
May I assume from your dress windbreaker that

219
00:09:09,217 --> 00:09:11,988
you'll be joining us for dinner?

220
00:09:11,988 --> 00:09:14,546
Yep, but I'm making a pitch 
that we eat at the Timber Mill.

221
00:09:14,546 --> 00:09:16,995
I got a coupon from there that expires tomorrow.

222
00:09:16,995 --> 00:09:21,740
Oh.  If I dine there tonight, so may I.

223
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,484
Hello, Dr. Crane.

224
00:09:23,484 --> 00:09:28,224
Oh, there's the British bobcat!

225
00:09:28,224 --> 00:09:29,498
Now, look, she's still a little bit over

226
00:09:29,498 --> 00:09:31,058
the edge about this Joe thing.

227
00:09:31,058 --> 00:09:32,507
So you better watch your step or you're gonna

228
00:09:32,507 --> 00:09:34,452
have a repeat of this morning.

229
00:09:34,452 --> 00:09:37,996
We wouldn't want that, would we?

230
00:09:37,996 --> 00:09:40,649
Chips, Daphne?  Was that wise?

231
00:09:40,649 --> 00:09:41,656
What do you mean?

232
00:09:41,656 --> 00:09:46,791
You know what they say, 
"many chips make for chunky hips."

233
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:52,604
Waddle, waddle, waddle!

234
00:09:52,604 --> 00:09:53,937
Have you lost your mind?!

235
00:09:53,937 --> 00:09:57,089
Oh, no, no, I'm glad if I put on a few pounds.

236
00:09:57,089 --> 00:10:01,408
Now maybe Joe will stop 
nagging me to plump up!

237
00:10:01,408 --> 00:10:03,783
Hey, Fras, how was the focus group?

238
00:10:03,783 --> 00:10:05,321
Fine, I guess.

239
00:10:05,321 --> 00:10:08,207
Oh, well, you said yourself 
they didn't mean anything.

240
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:09,481
Yes, well, it's one thing to say that.

241
00:10:09,481 --> 00:10:13,570
It's another to sit there 
being personally attacked!

242
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:15,327
One man actually said,

243
00:10:15,327 --> 00:10:18,550
"I just don't like him."

244
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:30,511
Only one?

245
00:10:30,511 --> 00:10:33,089
I'm sure someone must have said something nice.

246
00:10:33,089 --> 00:10:35,985
Well, all the other eleven had 
nothing but high praise.

247
00:10:35,985 --> 00:10:37,344
Eleven out of twelve liked you?

248
00:10:37,344 --> 00:10:38,560
You should be thrilled!

249
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,050
F..DR didn't have that kind of approval rating.

250
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:42,959
Yes, or Churchill for that matter.

251
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:50,327
Churchill that cigar-chomping 
gin blossom with a face attached!

252
00:10:50,327 --> 00:10:51,623
You're right about that.

253
00:10:51,623 --> 00:10:58,192
There's a kiss hello to put you off your tea.

254
00:10:58,192 --> 00:11:00,217
I wish I was able to talk to 
this man and ask him what it is

255
00:11:00,217 --> 00:11:01,921
about me that he doesn't like.

256
00:11:01,921 --> 00:11:03,625
But, I-I can't, you see, he was told that

257
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:05,656
his comments would be kept confidential.

258
00:11:05,656 --> 00:11:06,480
Just forget it.

259
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,640
Come on, let's go out to dinner.

260
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,297
I'm buying.

261
00:11:08,297 --> 00:11:10,161
Well, what is it he doesn't like about me?

262
00:11:10,161 --> 00:11:12,481
My voice, my manner, do I intimidate him?

263
00:11:12,481 --> 00:11:13,232
I don't know!

264
00:11:13,232 --> 00:11:14,239
What is it about you?

265
00:11:14,239 --> 00:11:15,769
Everybody has to love you!

266
00:11:15,769 --> 00:11:17,559
Just like when you were in 
that play in high school.

267
00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:19,265
You get standing ovations every night,

268
00:11:19,265 --> 00:11:20,831
all your friends say you're great,

269
00:11:20,831 --> 00:11:23,040
you got one lousy review in the school paper

270
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,641
and you sulked for a week.

271
00:11:24,641 --> 00:11:26,650
Well, you know, Dad, I'd like to 
think I've matured a bit since then.

272
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:27,809
But, you know, you would have sulked too,

273
00:11:27,809 --> 00:11:28,696
if you'd read in the paper,

274
00:11:28,696 --> 00:11:31,354
"Mr. Crane's attempts to gyrate
his hips as Conrad,

275
00:11:31,354 --> 00:11:33,848
the teen idol in 'Bye-Bye, Birdie,'
made this reviewer say,

276
00:11:33,848 --> 00:11:40,758
'Bye-bye, breakfast!'"

277
00:11:40,758 --> 00:11:49,735
That review was a mash note 
compared to my first draft.

278
00:11:49,735 --> 00:11:51,912
I know just what you're going through.

279
00:11:51,912 --> 00:11:54,391
I once won a dance competition hands down,

280
00:11:54,391 --> 00:11:57,146
but instead of celebrating I spent the whole night

281
00:11:57,146 --> 00:11:59,712
fretting over my one bad score.

282
00:11:59,712 --> 00:12:01,017
Silly-head!

283
00:12:01,017 --> 00:12:04,866
Idiot.

284
00:12:04,866 --> 00:12:08,695
Oh, I've stepped in it now!

285
00:12:08,695 --> 00:12:10,033
Listen here, Dr. Crane?

286
00:12:10,033 --> 00:12:11,297
Yeah, Daphne?

287
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:14,296
All right now, Daphne, just a moment!

288
00:12:14,296 --> 00:12:16,402
Just try to remember what you're 
like when you're arguing with Joe.

289
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:17,285
Consider Niles's situation.

290
00:12:17,285 --> 00:12:18,381
He's separated.

291
00:12:18,381 --> 00:12:20,662
You can't imagine the emotional see-saw he's on.

292
00:12:20,662 --> 00:12:22,374
Not to mention the fact that he may be unaware that

293
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:25,735
he's acting like a complete jackass!

294
00:12:25,735 --> 00:12:27,321
Of course, you're right.

295
00:12:27,321 --> 00:12:29,591
I'm sorry, I should be more sensitive.

296
00:12:29,591 --> 00:12:41,628
From now on, nothing you say 
can make me cross with you.

297
00:12:41,628 --> 00:12:44,158
I suppose I had that coming.

298
00:12:44,158 --> 00:12:46,710
Though I think "jackass" was a tad over the line.

299
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:51,501
Well, just consider it payback for 
the headline, "Crane's 'Birdie' Lays An Egg!"

300
00:12:51,501 --> 00:12:53,205
All right, now, Fras, you got to let it go.

301
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:54,504
You know, no matter who you are,

302
00:12:54,504 --> 00:12:57,893
no matter what you do, you can't please everyone.

303
00:12:57,893 --> 00:13:02,245
I suppose my negative baggage is 
just a pound or two over the weight limit.

304
00:13:02,245 --> 00:13:05,193
O.K., good, come on, let's go have dinner.

305
00:13:05,193 --> 00:13:06,296
This is good!

306
00:13:06,296 --> 00:13:07,062
This is healthy!

307
00:13:07,062 --> 00:13:10,977
I'm letting go!

308
00:13:17,095 --> 00:13:21,102
There he is.

309
00:13:21,102 --> 00:13:24,478
The man who... doesn't like me.

310
00:13:24,478 --> 00:13:28,241
I knew we should have taken two cars.

311
00:13:34,324 --> 00:13:36,829
What the hell is the matter with you?

312
00:13:36,829 --> 00:13:37,478
I'm sorry, Dad.

313
00:13:37,478 --> 00:13:39,768
It's just that "I just don't like him,"

314
00:13:39,768 --> 00:13:42,763
it's not specific enough.

315
00:13:42,763 --> 00:13:43,852
Why doesn't he like me?

316
00:13:43,852 --> 00:13:45,390
What difference does it make?

317
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:47,526
Well, if his point was valid, 
I would do something about it.

318
00:13:47,526 --> 00:13:49,878
If it's not, well, then I could dismiss it.

319
00:13:49,878 --> 00:13:51,171
Fine, go talk to him.

320
00:13:51,171 --> 00:13:51,974
I can't.

321
00:13:51,974 --> 00:13:55,310
He's not supposed to know I was
part of the focus group.

322
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:58,454
You, Dad!  You could go talk to him for me.

323
00:13:58,454 --> 00:14:00,222
Oh, for crying out loud?

324
00:14:00,222 --> 00:14:04,132
Look, if we're going to be here for
a while, could we at least lock the doors?

325
00:14:04,132 --> 00:14:06,413
Relax, Niles, the neighborhood's O.K.

326
00:14:06,413 --> 00:14:08,414
The docks are two blocks from here!

327
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:09,438
So's the Ritz-Carleton.

328
00:14:09,438 --> 00:14:14,084
Exactly!  We're caught halfway between heaven and hell.

329
00:14:14,084 --> 00:14:15,821
All I want is more information.

330
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:18,334
Dad, please?  Please go talk to him for me?

331
00:14:18,334 --> 00:14:20,766
All right, if I get an answer 
for you, can we go to dinner?

332
00:14:20,766 --> 00:14:21,841
O.K., fine.

333
00:14:21,841 --> 00:14:23,464
Oh, but wait, wait, wait!

334
00:14:23,464 --> 00:14:25,173
Now you can't just walk up there and ask him.

335
00:14:25,173 --> 00:14:27,024
He'll know that I sent you.

336
00:14:27,024 --> 00:14:30,385
Got to find some artful way of 
introducing the subject.

337
00:14:30,385 --> 00:14:33,432
Can we at least hide Dad's handicapped sign?

338
00:14:33,432 --> 00:14:36,115
It sends a clear signal that we're 
incapable of fighting back!

339
00:14:36,115 --> 00:14:39,149
So do your suspenders.

340
00:14:39,149 --> 00:14:40,190
All right, I've got it, I've got it.

341
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:42,078
You're a business man in town from Chicago.

342
00:14:42,078 --> 00:14:43,235
No, no, it's too obvious.

343
00:14:43,235 --> 00:14:44,843
Uh, from Cleveland.

344
00:14:44,843 --> 00:14:46,332
No would ever pretend to be from Cleveland.

345
00:14:46,332 --> 00:14:47,524
Fine, then we eat.

346
00:14:47,524 --> 00:14:49,349
Wait, wait, we're not through yet!

347
00:14:49,349 --> 00:14:52,004
Yes, you've had a bad sales month,
and you're a little depressed.

348
00:14:52,004 --> 00:14:54,347
You happen to see an add for my 
show on the side of a bus,

349
00:14:54,347 --> 00:14:57,133
and you were wondering if I'm 
as intelligent as I look.

350
00:14:57,133 --> 00:14:57,746
What?

351
00:14:57,746 --> 00:14:59,341
Oh, just word it your own way.

352
00:14:59,341 --> 00:15:01,428
Are we clear on this now?

353
00:15:01,428 --> 00:15:02,274
All right, I got it.

354
00:15:02,274 --> 00:15:06,179
Businessman, Cleveland, depressed,  then eat!

355
00:15:06,179 --> 00:15:08,044
Yes, Dad, eat!

356
00:15:08,044 --> 00:15:12,678
Honestly, sometimes you can get
so obsessed about things!

357
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:17,106
Oh, God, it's raining!

358
00:15:20,301 --> 00:15:21,155
Hi, I'm Marty Crane.

359
00:15:21,155 --> 00:15:22,732
My son's Dr. Frasier Crane.

360
00:15:22,732 --> 00:15:24,586
He's across the street in that BMW.

361
00:15:24,586 --> 00:15:26,876
No, don't look!

362
00:15:26,876 --> 00:15:28,094
Oh, my God.

363
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:29,565
He was behind the mirror.

364
00:15:29,565 --> 00:15:30,451
Look, don't worry about it.

365
00:15:30,451 --> 00:15:31,492
He's not mad at you.

366
00:15:31,492 --> 00:15:33,426
He just want to know why you don't like him.

367
00:15:33,426 --> 00:15:35,335
But I do like him.

368
00:15:35,335 --> 00:15:35,873
No, you don't.

369
00:15:35,873 --> 00:15:37,489
Oh, yes, I do!

370
00:15:37,489 --> 00:15:39,206
No, he heard what you said.

371
00:15:39,206 --> 00:15:40,493
They lied to me.

372
00:15:40,493 --> 00:15:46,305
They lied about.. They lied about the
mirror, they lied about the free gift.

373
00:15:46,305 --> 00:15:51,430
If that's a tod back, what the hell is
funny pack

374
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:56,504
Look, I just need you to be more specific
What don't you like him about.

375
00:15:56,504 --> 00:15:57,476
I can't do this.

376
00:15:57,476 --> 00:16:01,171
I don't like to say bad things 
about people, and you are his father?

377
00:16:01,171 --> 00:16:02,422
No, you'd be doing me a favor!

378
00:16:02,422 --> 00:16:04,110
Just answer this one question,

379
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:06,655
and we'll all get out of your life forever.

380
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:07,714
you're promising?

381
00:16:07,714 --> 00:16:10,017
Absolutely.

382
00:16:10,017 --> 00:16:11,869
All right.

383
00:16:11,869 --> 00:16:13,986
I-I don't know your son well.

384
00:16:13,986 --> 00:16:21,357
But, uh, I guess I find him, uh,
just a little bit... annoying.

385
00:16:21,357 --> 00:16:22,279
Yeah?

386
00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:24,106
Annoying.

387
00:16:24,106 --> 00:16:25,216
O.K.  You did good.

388
00:16:25,216 --> 00:16:26,361
Thanks.

389
00:16:26,361 --> 00:16:29,796
Please tell your son I'm sorry 
that he annoys me so much.

390
00:16:29,796 --> 00:16:33,469
Will do.

391
00:16:33,469 --> 00:16:36,007
Not yet... not yet... not yet.

392
00:16:36,007 --> 00:16:43,336
OK, unlock!

393
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:46,334
And lock!

394
00:16:46,334 --> 00:16:47,304
Mission accomplished.

395
00:16:47,304 --> 00:16:47,910
Good.

396
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:48,632
Did he believe my story?

397
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:50,271
Oh, yeah, I had him going pretty good.

398
00:16:50,271 --> 00:16:53,042
That Cleveland thing really sold it.

399
00:16:53,042 --> 00:16:54,511
Well, we better go eat now, huh?

400
00:16:54,511 --> 00:16:55,351
Before he sees us again.

401
00:16:55,351 --> 00:16:57,009
Right.

402
00:16:57,009 --> 00:16:59,344
So, uh, Dad, what doesn't he like about me?

403
00:16:59,344 --> 00:17:01,408
He said you annoy him.

404
00:17:01,408 --> 00:17:03,528
Yes, how so?

405
00:17:03,528 --> 00:17:04,696
Well, I didn't ask him.

406
00:17:04,696 --> 00:17:06,601
What do you mean you didn't ask him?

407
00:17:06,601 --> 00:17:07,608
Oh, geez!

408
00:17:07,608 --> 00:17:10,117
I'm sorry, Dad, but I have no idea 
what "he's annoying" means!

409
00:17:10,117 --> 00:17:13,997
Well, it's clear enough to me!

410
00:17:13,997 --> 00:17:19,754
Frasier, not to appear unsympathetic but
I had my i'm dangerous space on so long
it's starting to hurt.

411
00:17:19,754 --> 00:17:21,975
oh, what is about me he couldn't find
so annoying.

412
00:17:21,975 --> 00:17:27,117
well, he mentioned something about
not letting old man to eat!

413
00:17:27,117 --> 00:17:30,775
I'm just going to have to do this myself!

414
00:17:30,775 --> 00:17:31,254
Here.

415
00:17:31,254 --> 00:17:33,929
Thank you.

416
00:17:33,929 --> 00:17:34,749
Who're you calling?

417
00:17:34,749 --> 00:17:35,584
No one.

418
00:17:35,584 --> 00:17:37,976
I just pressed 911, and I'm keeping 
my finger poised

419
00:17:37,976 --> 00:17:40,418
over the Send button in case there's
trouble with those hooligans.

420
00:17:40,418 --> 00:17:44,147
Oh, the UPS men or the little girls
playing in the puddle?

421
00:17:46,942 --> 00:17:47,493
Hello.

422
00:17:47,493 --> 00:17:49,390
Hello.

423
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:50,463
I can help you?

424
00:17:50,463 --> 00:17:57,029
Uh, yes, yes, you were recently 
speaking with a salesman from Cleveland.

425
00:17:57,029 --> 00:17:58,440
I don't think so.

426
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,958
It was just five minutes ago.

427
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:03,031
He left you and went over to that 
car waiting right over there.

428
00:18:03,031 --> 00:18:05,557
You see?

429
00:18:05,557 --> 00:18:06,373
Oh, God, no.

430
00:18:06,373 --> 00:18:07,704
You're him, it's you.

431
00:18:07,704 --> 00:18:08,565
Yes, yes, it is.

432
00:18:08,565 --> 00:18:10,382
I'm so sorry, I really don't mean to bother you

433
00:18:10,382 --> 00:18:13,100
but I would like to talk to you for a minute.

434
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,232
I like your show.

435
00:18:14,232 --> 00:18:15,078
Oh, no.

436
00:18:15,078 --> 00:18:18,991
I like your show, and I like you.

437
00:18:18,991 --> 00:18:19,772
That man was my father

438
00:18:19,772 --> 00:18:21,862
I like your father!

439
00:18:21,862 --> 00:18:23,271
Oh, that's very nice of you,
but you see, you told him that,

440
00:18:23,271 --> 00:18:25,115
uh, you find me annoying.

441
00:18:25,115 --> 00:18:26,861
Yes, yes, you did, and that's all right.

442
00:18:26,861 --> 00:18:28,460
I don't mind constructive criticism.

443
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:30,495
It's just that I wish you could 
be a bit more specific.

444
00:18:30,495 --> 00:18:32,879
What exactly is it about me that 
you find so annoying?

445
00:18:32,879 --> 00:18:33,718
You're not annoying.

446
00:18:33,718 --> 00:18:35,757
Yes, I am!

447
00:18:35,757 --> 00:18:36,902
Would I be here if I wasn't?

448
00:18:36,902 --> 00:18:38,810
Well, I have enjoyed talking to you very much,

449
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:40,335
but it's time for my break.

450
00:18:40,335 --> 00:18:44,597
Oh, no, no, please!

451
00:18:44,597 --> 00:18:46,891
I'm so sorry.

452
00:18:46,891 --> 00:18:48,767
I am a sticky mess.

453
00:18:48,767 --> 00:18:50,151
Let me help you with that.

454
00:18:50,151 --> 00:18:52,966
No, no, no, no, it's fine, good.

455
00:18:52,966 --> 00:18:54,117
Manu?

456
00:18:54,117 --> 00:18:57,915
Drive safe.

457
00:18:57,915 --> 00:18:59,068
Oh, dear God!

458
00:18:59,068 --> 00:19:00,174
I'm so sorry!

459
00:19:00,174 --> 00:19:01,804
Are you all right?

460
00:19:01,804 --> 00:19:03,675
Let me look at it, let me look at it?

461
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:04,365
No, no!

462
00:19:04,365 --> 00:19:04,934
Look, I am a doctor.

463
00:19:04,934 --> 00:19:06,628
No, no, I just go to the restaurant to put ice on it.

464
00:19:06,628 --> 00:19:10,207
Right, you know, I'll hold down the fort here!

465
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:13,771
Glad to be of help!

466
00:19:13,771 --> 00:19:15,909
He's crushed the gentleman's hand, and now

467
00:19:15,909 --> 00:19:19,604
he appears to be commandeering his newsstand.

468
00:19:19,604 --> 00:19:23,860
Uh-huh.

469
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:24,773
Oh, good lord.

470
00:19:24,773 --> 00:19:29,010
Smoking in the worst places!

471
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:29,820
How much for the paper?

472
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:32,812
Ah, yes, uh, well, that would be

473
00:19:32,812 --> 00:19:35,614
oh, fifty cents.

474
00:19:35,614 --> 00:19:37,086
Thank you so much.  There we are.

475
00:19:37,086 --> 00:19:40,260
Scuse me, are you Dr. Crane from the radio?

476
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:41,371
Why, yes, I am.

477
00:19:41,371 --> 00:19:43,555
Oh, I just never miss your show!

478
00:19:43,555 --> 00:19:44,485
I love you!

479
00:19:44,485 --> 00:19:46,099
I guess you get tired of hearing that.

480
00:19:46,099 --> 00:19:50,022
Oh, occupational hazard.

481
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,077
Oh, would you mind?

482
00:19:51,077 --> 00:19:53,260
Oh, I wouldn't mind at all.

483
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,013
To Amanda.

484
00:19:54,013 --> 00:19:57,269
Amanda, it's a pleasure.

485
00:19:57,269 --> 00:19:59,356
What are you doing here, anyway?

486
00:19:59,356 --> 00:20:02,871
Oh, oh, well you see, let me explain, you see.

487
00:20:02,871 --> 00:20:08,106
The, uh, radio station conducted
a little audio survey today,

488
00:20:08,106 --> 00:20:10,732
and although the response was favorable

489
00:20:10,732 --> 00:20:12,659
from eleven out of twelve of the participants?

490
00:20:12,659 --> 00:20:13,417
Is that smoking?

491
00:20:13,417 --> 00:20:15,524
Well, some people might consider it smoking,

492
00:20:15,524 --> 00:20:16,755
but you see, for me?

493
00:20:16,755 --> 00:20:18,265
FIRE!

494
00:20:18,265 --> 00:20:20,934
Oh, my God!

495
00:20:28,707 --> 00:20:33,101
oh my god
Frasier set his newsstand on fire.

496
00:20:33,101 --> 00:20:37,928
Mmm-hmm.

497
00:20:54,396 --> 00:21:02,131
Uh, may I?

498
00:21:02,131 --> 00:21:03,700
Look, I know there's nothing

499
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,541
I can say right now that would 
make you feel any better,

500
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:12,601
but rest assured, I will be financially
responsible for everything.

501
00:21:12,601 --> 00:21:18,033
All this because you had to know 
why I do not like you.

502
00:21:18,033 --> 00:21:20,902
Well, you were kind of vague.

503
00:21:20,902 --> 00:21:22,490
You want to know why?

504
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:24,074
I'll tell you why.

505
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:28,404
I think you are a smarty-pants.

506
00:21:28,404 --> 00:21:30,435
I was too polite to say that before.

507
00:21:30,435 --> 00:21:35,508
But then you spied on me, you stalked
me, you badgered me, you poured

508
00:21:35,508 --> 00:21:39,178
Yoo-Hoo down my Dockers, you 
crunched my hand, and then, as

509
00:21:39,178 --> 00:21:43,370
if all that was not enough, you 
burned down my newsstand,

510
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:51,050
my livelihood, a gift to me from my 
beloved uncle, may he rest in peace!

511
00:21:51,050 --> 00:22:03,930
Was that so hard?

512
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:06,192
