1
00:00:09,558 --> 00:00:13,570
Well, we've got about thirty seconds. I think we've got time for one quick call.

2
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:15,772
Hello, Marlene, I'm listening.

3
00:00:15,772 --> 00:00:17,188
Oh my God, I'm really on?

4
00:00:17,188 --> 00:00:18,500
Yes, your problem, please...

5
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:21,231
Lucky, Lucky, get down.  George, get the dog!

6
00:00:21,231 --> 00:00:23,542
Oh my God, this is so exciting!

7
00:00:23,542 --> 00:00:26,462
Honey, honey, get the baby.  George, get your son!

8
00:00:26,462 --> 00:00:28,388
OK, OK, here it is, Dr. Crane:

9
00:00:28,388 --> 00:00:30,820
if my husband and I don't find some time to have sex soon,

10
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:35,130
I think I'm gonna burst.  I may even have to go to a department store and pick up a stranger.

11
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:40,060
Oh, kids!  Look who's here without calling first, Nana and Pop Pop!

12
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:43,779
I'll call you back.

13
00:00:43,779 --> 00:00:48,889
Well, to all you Marlenes out there, may I suggest that sex with a stranger is not the answer.

14
00:00:48,889 --> 00:00:51,811
Why don't you just pack the kids off with Nana and Pop Pop,

15
00:00:51,811 --> 00:00:56,258
lock Lucky downstairs in the basement, grab your husband, take him to the sturdiest kitchen table you have,

16
00:00:56,258 --> 00:01:01,113
and let the postman ring twice!

17
00:01:01,113 --> 00:01:03,800
Now, to the rest of my listeners, I'll be off on vacation for the next week,

18
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:08,719
so please tune in to my replacement,
the noted podiatrist, Dr Garreth Wooten,

19
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:12,572
who'll be discussing the virtues of his new book, "Bunions and Blisters and Corns,"

20
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:14,653
Oh My!

21
00:01:16,152 --> 00:01:19,963
I hate it when that weird foot freak subs for you.

22
00:01:19,963 --> 00:01:21,896
Couldn't you just have Frederick come and visit you here?

23
00:01:21,896 --> 00:01:25,960
Sorry Roz, the taxi's waiting outside to take me to the airport.

24
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,017
Oh well, have a great time. 
Oh, thanks.

25
00:01:28,017 --> 00:01:29,932
And don't forget to bring me a present!

26
00:01:29,932 --> 00:01:32,679
I'll get you a nice T-shirt from Colonial Williamsburg.

27
00:01:32,679 --> 00:01:34,890
You're taking Frederick to Williamsburg?

28
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:37,355
Eeew!

29
00:01:37,355 --> 00:01:42,393
No, it's a wonderful vacation spot!  We're going to dip candles, tan leather, churn butter...

30
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:44,887
Hey, Frederick Crane, you just finished the first grade,

31
00:01:44,887 --> 00:01:46,313
what are you going to do now?

32
00:01:46,313 --> 00:01:49,634
I'm going to Butterworld!

33
00:01:53,862 --> 00:01:56,740
Hey Daphne, bring that laundry over here, will you?

34
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:57,606
What for?

35
00:01:57,606 --> 00:02:00,516
Well, I was just reading about an intelligence test you can give your dog.

36
00:02:00,516 --> 00:02:03,725
You throw a towel over its head and see how long it takes him to shake it off.

37
00:02:03,725 --> 00:02:04,623
Eddie!

38
00:02:04,623 --> 00:02:07,358
Oh, and the faster he takes the towel off, the smarter he is?

39
00:02:07,358 --> 00:02:11,534
No, the faster he folds it.

40
00:02:11,534 --> 00:02:12,798
All right,

41
00:02:12,798 --> 00:02:16,066
they ranked all the dogs and the smartest was a border collie;

44
00:02:24,498 --> 00:02:26,745
Six... seven.

45
00:02:26,745 --> 00:02:34,020
OK, the next fastest one was a poodle, I know he's as smart as a poodle.

46
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,557
OK, so he's no poodle...

47
00:02:36,557 --> 00:02:38,677
he's not a beagle either...

48
00:02:38,677 --> 00:02:41,425
or a German shepherd... or a Labrador

49
00:02:41,425 --> 00:02:44,256
Oh, for God's sake, Eddie!

50
00:02:44,256 --> 00:02:48,036
Yes, well, if you ask me, he's refusing to do that trick because he knows if he does it right,

51
00:02:48,036 --> 00:02:51,497
you'll have him doing it every time we have company.

52
00:02:51,497 --> 00:02:54,318
Hey, I'll bet you're right!

53
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:56,830
Nice going, Eddie!

54
00:02:59,368 --> 00:03:00,894
Oh, hello, Dr. Crane.

55
00:03:00,894 --> 00:03:05,076
I appreciate the false cheer, Daphne.  But I'm sure you've seen this?  Today's society page?

56
00:03:05,076 --> 00:03:10,818
Don't tell me, don't tell me, don't tell me!  I'm saving it for after dinner!

57
00:03:10,818 --> 00:03:12,704
Apparently Maris is going on a three-week cruise.

58
00:03:12,704 --> 00:03:16,044
Her friends threw her a bon voyage party.  Look at the photo.

59
00:03:16,044 --> 00:03:19,680
It's Maris on the arm of Pierson Broadwater.

60
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,069
Oh, Dr. Crane, look!  She's just standing there, barely touching him,

61
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:25,788
with only the tiniest bit of a smile on her face!

62
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:30,166
I know, you can practically hear the zing zing zing of her heartstrings!

63
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:32,018
Oh, Dr Crane... 
Sorry, Niles.

64
00:03:32,018 --> 00:03:38,315
Oh, it gets worse.  This morning I spoke to Marta, my ex-maid and current mole.

65
00:03:38,315 --> 00:03:41,739
She reports that Broadwater is just the latest in a parade of escorts.

66
00:03:41,739 --> 00:03:46,504
The gigolos are swarming around Maris like ants on a Snickers bar!

67
00:03:46,504 --> 00:03:48,192
Well, wait a minute, that's good news.

68
00:03:48,192 --> 00:03:51,320
If she's seeing a whole bunch of people, that means she's not serious about any one of them.

69
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,788
You think? 
Yeah, sure!

70
00:03:52,788 --> 00:03:54,276
They're probably just her escorts.

71
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:56,337
You know how she loves going to parties.

72
00:03:56,337 --> 00:04:01,939
Yes, and she never liked going anywhere alone.  Except to bed.

73
00:04:01,939 --> 00:04:04,997
More good news.

74
00:04:04,997 --> 00:04:08,113
And Niles, it wouldn't hurt you to go out a little bit every once in a while too.

75
00:04:08,113 --> 00:04:10,959
If you're suggesting that I start dating, you can save your breath.

76
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,018
Women don't exactly find me irresistible.

77
00:04:13,018 --> 00:04:15,957
Oh, come on, Niles, you've had lots of girlfriends.

78
00:04:15,957 --> 00:04:20,680
Oh, let's count.  There's Maris...

79
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:26,819
oh no, Dora, my childhood pen pal from Costa Rica...

80
00:04:26,819 --> 00:04:32,141
I seem to recall a little girl in the fourth grade who lured me to a stairwell to show me her underpants.

81
00:04:32,141 --> 00:04:36,754
You know, Niles, I think your problem is you still picture yourself as the same geeky kid you were in high school.

82
00:04:36,754 --> 00:04:38,570
But you've come a long way since then.

83
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:41,440
And you're not doing yourself any favours sitting home every night.

84
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,595
Now just think about it.

85
00:04:44,595 --> 00:04:45,702
Wine, Dr. Crane?

86
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:50,222
Well, wouldn't you?

87
00:04:54,908 --> 00:04:56,462
HE WAS A BAND LEADER MARRIED TO CHARO

88
00:04:56,462 --> 00:05:00,173
Oh, give it up, the man had every right to be proud of his dog.

89
00:05:00,173 --> 00:05:02,592
Well, I just don't like show-offs, OK?

90
00:05:02,592 --> 00:05:08,571
"Ginger, catch the frisbee.  Ginger, roll over.  Ginger, do my taxes!"

91
00:05:08,571 --> 00:05:10,670
Just because Eddie's not good at tricks...

92
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:16,534
The hell he isn't!  He just likes the kind that gives him a chance to use his brain!  Eddie's a thinker!

93
00:05:16,534 --> 00:05:21,101
Just watch this.  Open the door for him.

94
00:05:21,101 --> 00:05:24,128
Now, I've been teaching him the names of all his chew toys.

95
00:05:24,128 --> 00:05:27,517
Eddie, get your banana.

96
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:32,039
Now he's thinking,

97
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:38,346
"which one's the banana?"

98
00:05:38,346 --> 00:05:44,976
Now he's thinking, "what the heck did I do with my banana?"

99
00:05:44,976 --> 00:05:48,713
Now he's thinking, "which one's the emergency button?"

100
00:05:48,713 --> 00:05:50,468
Come on!

101
00:05:53,418 --> 00:05:54,530
Oh, Dr Crane!

102
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:57,004
Hello.  I let myself in, I hope that's all right.

103
00:05:57,004 --> 00:05:58,065
Fine.  What's up?

104
00:05:58,065 --> 00:06:00,759
Oh, I just stopped by to ask you a question.  Are you free Saturday night?

105
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:01,570
Sure!

106
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:04,112
Well, I'm not!  I have a date!

107
00:06:04,112 --> 00:06:06,432
Oh! 
Oh!

108
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:07,881
Bravo, Dr. Crane!

109
00:06:07,881 --> 00:06:09,619
Good for you!  Who is she?

110
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:16,318
Marjorie Nash, the "Fruit On The Bottom" yogurt heiress.

111
00:06:16,318 --> 00:06:20,236
I bumped into her at the Frye museum.  Before I knew it, your advice was thundering in my ears.

112
00:06:20,236 --> 00:06:21,782
I found myself asking her out.

113
00:06:21,782 --> 00:06:25,709
We'll be attending our club's annual winter dance, the "Snow Ball!"

114
00:06:25,709 --> 00:06:27,331
Good for you!

115
00:06:27,331 --> 00:06:28,445
What's she like?

116
00:06:28,445 --> 00:06:36,552
Well, she's terribly haughty and rumours persist about her husband's death.  But still, a date's a date!

117
00:06:36,552 --> 00:06:39,372
Snow Ball?  Sounds very glamourous.

118
00:06:39,372 --> 00:06:40,503
I didn't know you could dance!

119
00:06:40,503 --> 00:06:42,435
Oh, I can't.

120
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:45,553
Oh, dear.

121
00:06:45,553 --> 00:06:49,097
You don't think she'll want me to?

122
00:06:49,097 --> 00:06:53,027
I've taken Maris to dozens of these things, she's never once asked to dance...

123
00:06:53,027 --> 00:06:58,780
of course, Maris dislikes public displays of rhythm.

124
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:02,134
Oh, this is terrible!  My first date's a miserable failure before it even begins.

125
00:07:02,134 --> 00:07:03,179
I'll just have to cancel.

126
00:07:03,179 --> 00:07:05,306
All you need are a few dancing lessons.

127
00:07:05,306 --> 00:07:07,342
I'd be happy to give you some.

128
00:07:07,342 --> 00:07:07,902
You would?

129
00:07:07,902 --> 00:07:13,022
Yeah!  Growing up, I used to practise all the time with my brother Billy - the ballroom dancer?

130
00:07:13,022 --> 00:07:18,123
I couldn't prevail upon you like that, it would be too much trouble. We'll have to move this!

131
00:07:19,516 --> 00:07:21,584
OK, now push the chair back

132
00:07:21,584 --> 00:07:24,630
Or not.

133
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:28,387
Alright, we'll start with the box step.

134
00:07:28,387 --> 00:07:29,899
Box step...
It's very simple.

135
00:07:29,899 --> 00:07:34,469
Take my hand like so, and your other hand goes around my waist.

136
00:07:34,469 --> 00:07:37,155
Now, start with your left foot.

137
00:07:37,155 --> 00:07:39,359
OK, which one?

138
00:07:39,359 --> 00:07:44,679
Oh, hush!  Step towards me, then bring your right foot forward-and-over,

139
00:07:44,679 --> 00:07:46,597
and slide the left over to meet it.

140
00:07:46,597 --> 00:07:50,795
Then the right foot goes back, the left back-and-over,

141
00:07:50,795 --> 00:07:53,032
and the right slides next to it.

142
00:07:53,032 --> 00:07:55,850
And that's it!  All right, once again.

143
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,191
A one-two-

144
00:07:58,191 --> 00:08:01,868
Oh! three, a two-two-three,

145
00:08:01,868 --> 00:08:07,092
a three-two-three, a four-two three...

146
00:08:07,092 --> 00:08:10,607
This is boring yet difficult.

147
00:08:10,607 --> 00:08:13,725
Aw, there's no trick to dancing.  It's just a matter of coordination.

148
00:08:13,725 --> 00:08:22,494
Hell, if you can ride a bike, or skip rope, or kick a ball, you can certainly...

149
00:08:25,198 --> 00:08:31,205
Alright, once again.  A one-two- Oh!-three...

150
00:08:35,096 --> 00:08:37,112
You're really doing very well, Dr. Crane.

151
00:08:37,112 --> 00:08:39,174
Earlier you seemed a bit tense.

152
00:08:39,174 --> 00:08:43,107
You've really relaxed now though, haven't you?

153
00:08:46,348 --> 00:08:48,344
Hey, you two are looking pretty sharp.

154
00:08:48,344 --> 00:08:50,741
Well, I think we're ready to move on to the samba.

155
00:08:50,741 --> 00:08:56,041
Eddie, fetch me a samba tape.  Xavier Cougat.

156
00:08:56,041 --> 00:09:03,104
Now he's thinking, "the later Hollywood stuff, or the early New York recordings?"

157
00:09:03,104 --> 00:09:06,714
Now guess what I'm thinking. 
I'll get it myself.

158
00:09:06,714 --> 00:09:08,340
Well, I'm going to hit the hay.

159
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,227
Good-night -- bend-and-turn ?

160
00:09:10,227 --> 00:09:14,281
see-you-in-the-morning ?spin-and-dip

161
00:09:14,281 --> 00:09:17,248
there's-my-phone -- flip-and-push ?

162
00:09:17,248 --> 00:09:18,732
Niles-Crane.

163
00:09:18,732 --> 00:09:20,596
Oh, Marjorie.

164
00:09:20,596 --> 00:09:22,667
How are you?

165
00:09:22,667 --> 00:09:25,414
Oh, what a shame.  Well, er,

166
00:09:25,414 --> 00:09:28,401
no no it's alright, there'll be other dances.

167
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:31,099
No, no, I understand completely.

168
00:09:31,099 --> 00:09:33,092
Take care.

169
00:09:35,949 --> 00:09:37,962
Guess I won't be needing those dancing lessons.

170
00:09:37,962 --> 00:09:43,490
I guess not.  I'm sorry, son.

171
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:47,647
I couldn't find any Cougie, but this'll do!

172
00:09:47,647 --> 00:09:49,856
Alright now,

173
00:09:49,856 --> 00:09:52,948
in the samba you have to hold me a little closer.

174
00:09:52,948 --> 00:09:53,493
You ready?

175
00:09:53,493 --> 00:09:54,983
Daphne, there's one thing I wanted to mention...

176
00:09:54,983 --> 00:09:57,102
Yeah?

177
00:10:00,228 --> 00:10:03,111
I'm a dancer, a dancer dances!

178
00:10:06,925 --> 00:10:09,373
WHERE ELSE WOULD CORONERS 
GET TOGETHER?

179
00:10:09,373 --> 00:10:12,170
Wow..Look who's Here..
it's my dancing partner.

180
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:15,031
Hello, Fred! 
Hello, Ginger!

181
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:18,395
It's a little joke we have!

182
00:10:18,395 --> 00:10:20,637
Look Daphne, I got two new CDs today.

183
00:10:20,637 --> 00:10:23,433
Tonight we master the mambo and the conga.

184
00:10:23,433 --> 00:10:26,564
I can feel myself growing a pencil-thin moustache just saying that.

185
00:10:26,564 --> 00:10:27,882
You're having more lessons tonight?

186
00:10:27,882 --> 00:10:30,925
Oh, yes!  He's going to be the best dancer at the ball.

187
00:10:30,925 --> 00:10:34,088
I'll just go get us some coffees.

188
00:10:36,108 --> 00:10:38,918
Why didn't you tell her your date had cancelled?  You don't need more lessons.

189
00:10:38,918 --> 00:10:42,919
I wanted to, but she's just having so much fun!

190
00:10:42,919 --> 00:10:45,695
Come on, Niles, you think I don't see the way you look at Daphne?

191
00:10:45,695 --> 00:10:46,373
What are you implying?

192
00:10:46,373 --> 00:10:48,063
You know damn well what I'm implying.

193
00:10:48,063 --> 00:10:49,385
Take my word for it,

194
00:10:49,385 --> 00:10:51,433
you're sticking a fork in the toaster here.

195
00:10:51,433 --> 00:10:56,478
Well, my muffin's stuck!

196
00:10:59,324 --> 00:11:01,981
Besides, what's the harm in a few dance lessons?

197
00:11:01,981 --> 00:11:05,957
It's nighttime.  You're alone.  The music's on.

198
00:11:05,957 --> 00:11:08,166
You've got your arms around her.

199
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:10,671
You'll end up saying something you can't take back.

200
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:12,130
I have no intention of saying anything.

201
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:13,428
No one ever does.

202
00:11:13,428 --> 00:11:16,485
Take my word for it.

203
00:11:16,485 --> 00:11:19,338
When I was separated from your mother,

204
00:11:19,338 --> 00:11:24,103
there was this pretty coroner in the city morgue.

205
00:11:24,103 --> 00:11:26,720
I always had a bit of a crush on her.

206
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:32,988
So whenever we'd find a dead body, I'd yell out, "OK boys, I'll take it from here!"

207
00:11:32,988 --> 00:11:35,668
So one night, I invited her down to the corner bar.

208
00:11:35,668 --> 00:11:37,519
Coroners have their own bars?

209
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:45,253
No, corner, Niles, the corner bar!

210
00:11:45,253 --> 00:11:50,989
Anyway, we had a few drinks, the lights were low, Sinatra on the jukebox.

211
00:11:50,989 --> 00:11:54,700
Before I knew it, it just all came pouring out of me.  I told her how I felt.

212
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:59,140
I mean, I knew the second it was out of my mouth that it was a mistake.

213
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:03,645
She let me down easy but we still had to go on seeing each other all the time.

214
00:12:03,645 --> 00:12:08,567
It sure was no fun going to the morgue after that!

215
00:12:08,567 --> 00:12:12,380
So, what time are we starting your lessons tonight, Dr. Crane?

216
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:14,837
Actually, that won't be necessary.

217
00:12:14,837 --> 00:12:17,381
I just got a call from Marjorie.  Something's come up.

218
00:12:17,381 --> 00:12:18,574
I won't be going to the ball.

219
00:12:18,574 --> 00:12:20,668
Oh.  Well, I'm sorry.

220
00:12:20,668 --> 00:12:24,201
It's quite all right, and thank you for all your help.

221
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:29,201
It seems such a shame to waste all that hard work...

222
00:12:29,201 --> 00:12:34,513
I hope you don't think I'm being too forward, but what would you say about our going to the dance together?

223
00:12:34,513 --> 00:12:37,631
Now, now, he's already taken up too much of your time, Daphne,

224
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:38,783
he couldn't ask you to do that.

225
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:41,741
No, but it would be as much fun for me as it would be for him!

226
00:12:41,741 --> 00:12:43,652
I'd love an elegant evening out!

227
00:12:43,652 --> 00:12:45,571
What do you say, Dr. Crane?

228
00:12:45,571 --> 00:12:46,981
Tell her what you say, Dr. Crane.

229
00:12:46,981 --> 00:12:47,977
Pick you up at seven?

230
00:12:47,977 --> 00:12:51,337
Ooh, yes! Great!

231
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:03,407
No, Eddie that's not your banana, that's Mr. Pig.

232
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:05,289
Listen to the difference:

233
00:13:05,289 --> 00:13:11,680
pig, banana!  Pig, banana!  Pig, banana!

234
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,617
Ah, I still love you, you little pinhead.  Go sit down.

235
00:13:16,971 --> 00:13:20,277
Oh Frasier, am I glad you're back!  Listen, all sorts of....

236
00:13:20,277 --> 00:13:22,679
Dad, please, please!  I have just spent the most wonderful six days with Frederick.

237
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:25,344
I am technically still on vacation till ten a.m. tomorrow.

238
00:13:25,344 --> 00:13:26,415
Yeah, but listen...

239
00:13:26,415 --> 00:13:28,200
Bup-bup-bup-bup-bup!

240
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,659
Dad, I do not care to know how hard Daphne made you exercise,

241
00:13:31,659 --> 00:13:34,944
or about the boring foreign film Niles made you sit through,

242
00:13:34,944 --> 00:13:40,793
or about the progress of Eddie's on-again, off-again romance with the ottoman!

243
00:13:40,793 --> 00:13:42,433
But you don't understand... 
Dad, please!

244
00:13:42,433 --> 00:13:46,480
For all intents and purposes, I am not here.

245
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,601
That'll be my date! Ooh, I'm so excited,

246
00:13:49,601 --> 00:13:53,082
this is me first ball!  Oh, I hope he likes my dress...

247
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:53,490
Daphne?

248
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:56,973
Hello, Dr. Crane, welcome back!

249
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:59,078
Hello!

250
00:13:59,078 --> 00:14:04,094
Wow!
Ohhh, you!

251
00:14:04,094 --> 00:14:05,160
Niles?

252
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,289
Oh, Frasier, you're back! Well, our carriage awaits.

253
00:14:07,289 --> 00:14:10,141
And you'd better get her home at a decent hour, I'm gonna be waiting up for you!

254
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:12,854
Oh, Mr. Crane!

255
00:14:19,336 --> 00:14:21,880
What the hell was that?

256
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,385
Eddie, did you hear sumpin'?

257
00:14:24,385 --> 00:14:26,868
Can't be Frasier, he's still on vacation!

258
00:14:26,868 --> 00:14:29,172
Dad, what was that?

259
00:14:29,172 --> 00:14:33,386
Dad, will you stop kidding around?  Was that a date?  Dad!

260
00:14:48,046 --> 00:14:52,991
Oh, Dr. Crane, it's so beautiful!

261
00:14:52,991 --> 00:14:56,473
Just for tonight, could you call me Niles?

262
00:14:56,473 --> 00:14:59,680
You know, when I was at school I knew a boy named Niles.

263
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,362
I called him Niley.

264
00:15:02,362 --> 00:15:06,680
Just for tonight, could you call me Niles?

265
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:09,556
You're a vision... everyone's staring at you!

266
00:15:09,556 --> 00:15:12,391
Well, you look awfully handsome yourself...

267
00:15:12,391 --> 00:15:14,966
Niles.

268
00:15:18,986 --> 00:15:20,508
Would you like some champagne?

269
00:15:20,508 --> 00:15:22,692
Oh, that would be lovely. 
Be back in a moment.

270
00:15:23,382 --> 00:15:24,767
Two champagnes, tout de suite.

271
00:15:24,767 --> 00:15:27,980
Niles, dear! How are you!

272
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:28,904
Just fine, thanks.

273
00:15:28,904 --> 00:15:30,511
Andrew, say hello to Niles.

274
00:15:30,511 --> 00:15:34,172
Haven't seen you for ages.  Feel just terrible about you and Maris.

275
00:15:34,172 --> 00:15:38,499
Oh yes, we were just devastated.  Positively everyone's talking about it.

276
00:15:38,499 --> 00:15:39,943
Oh, and how is positively everyone?

277
00:15:39,943 --> 00:15:46,321
Devastated.  We were just saying that to Maris, when we ran into her and Bradley Paxton at the Breever's Cup.

278
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:49,500
No, she was with Calvin Oldi at the Breever's Cup.

279
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,641
Well, it's so hard to keep track

280
00:15:51,641 --> 00:15:55,157
anyway. Niles, if there's anything we can do to cheer you up?

281
00:15:55,157 --> 00:15:57,053
Just let us know...

282
00:15:57,053 --> 00:16:00,408
Perhaps a murder-suicide pact.

283
00:16:00,408 --> 00:16:02,687
Well, they weren't very nice!

284
00:16:02,687 --> 00:16:07,325
Well, everyone in our set seems to have this idea that while Maris is out living the high life,

285
00:16:07,325 --> 00:16:09,430
I'm sitting at home, crushed and lonely.

286
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:12,363
Yeah, well, never mind those gossipy twits.

287
00:16:12,363 --> 00:16:14,566
Tonight, you're all mine.

288
00:16:14,566 --> 00:16:21,043
Now take me in your arms, Niles, and let the music carry us away...

289
00:16:24,827 --> 00:16:28,697
Thank you, we'll be back in ten minutes.

290
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:49,708
I can't remember when I've had a better time.

291
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,634
I'm on Cloud Nine!

292
00:16:51,634 --> 00:16:55,582
I'd have to look down to see Cloud Nine!

293
00:16:55,582 --> 00:16:59,244
Daphne, I must tell you again, that is an exquisite gown.

294
00:16:59,244 --> 00:17:02,463
Oh, thanks! It was way out of my price range, but

295
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:09,540
did you ever see something and say, "I just have to have it?"

296
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:12,960
Where's my chair?

297
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,453
A tango!

298
00:17:18,453 --> 00:17:19,680
Oh, you never taught me a tango!

299
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,649
Oh, you'll love it!  It's perfect for you!

300
00:17:22,649 --> 00:17:27,927
This is a passionate, full-blooded dance that rose up from the slums of Buenos Aires.

301
00:17:27,927 --> 00:17:33,913
Well, the parallels between me and an unemployed gaucho aside, I think we probably should just sit this one out.

302
00:17:33,913 --> 00:17:38,386
Oh, nonsense!  There's only one rule in the tango:

303
00:17:38,386 --> 00:17:44,430
our bodies must be in continuous contact, with not a sliver of daylight between us.

304
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,719
I can do that.

305
00:17:48,946 --> 00:17:50,966
Stop!  Don't be afraid!

306
00:17:50,966 --> 00:17:53,221
Daphne won't let anything happen to you.

307
00:17:53,221 --> 00:17:55,122
I don't think-
Don't think!

308
00:17:55,122 --> 00:17:56,934
Just feel.

309
00:17:56,934 --> 00:18:00,102
You're an Argentine slum-dweller.

310
00:18:00,102 --> 00:18:04,635
You have no house, no car, you don't know where your next meal is coming from.

311
00:18:04,635 --> 00:18:06,764
But none of that matters.

312
00:18:06,764 --> 00:18:10,097
Because tonight...

313
00:18:10,097 --> 00:18:11,409
we have the tango!

314
00:18:11,409 --> 00:18:15,301
Oh mama, I've got it all!

315
00:18:22,452 --> 00:18:25,270
That's it!  You're dazzling!  You're brilliant!

316
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,300
But I feel you're holding back!

317
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,159
I am.

318
00:18:28,159 --> 00:18:31,128
Oh, this is no time for inhibitions!

319
00:18:31,128 --> 00:18:33,274
I know.

320
00:18:34,832 --> 00:18:38,293
Oh. let it out Niles. Let everything out!

321
00:18:38,293 --> 00:18:42,766
Oh Daphne, I adore you!

322
00:18:45,725 --> 00:18:49,504
I adore you too!

323
00:18:49,504 --> 00:18:52,520
What?!?!?

324
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,769
I adore you too.

325
00:18:54,769 --> 00:18:57,472
Oh, how I've longed to hear those words!

326
00:18:57,472 --> 00:18:59,648
Oh, how I've longed to say them!

327
00:18:59,648 --> 00:19:01,985
You're beautiful!  You're a goddess!

328
00:19:01,985 --> 00:19:05,092
I don't ever want this moment to end!

329
00:19:05,092 --> 00:19:07,428
Then let's not let it!

330
00:19:36,697 --> 00:19:39,421
This is the most glorious night of my life.

331
00:19:39,421 --> 00:19:42,774
Oh, mine too...

332
00:19:55,095 --> 00:19:58,609
Oh, Daphne!  I'm a new man!

333
00:19:58,609 --> 00:20:00,642
Do you have any idea what I'm feeling?

334
00:20:00,642 --> 00:20:05,997
Of course I do!  Your friends look positively dumbstruck.

335
00:20:05,997 --> 00:20:09,741
From now on there'll be no more of that "oh poor Niles" attitude...

336
00:20:09,741 --> 00:20:11,398
Far from it!

337
00:20:11,398 --> 00:20:14,981
I knew you were a good dancer,

338
00:20:14,981 --> 00:20:19,597
but I had no idea you were such a good actor!

339
00:20:19,597 --> 00:20:21,505
Actor?

340
00:20:21,505 --> 00:20:25,228
Yeah!  "Daphne, you're a goddess, Daphne, I adore you..."

341
00:20:25,228 --> 00:20:27,811
We fooled everyone, didn't we?

342
00:20:30,361 --> 00:20:35,321
Oh...oh.  We certainly did, didn't we?

343
00:20:35,321 --> 00:20:38,196
I'm surprised it was so easy!

344
00:20:38,196 --> 00:20:43,488
Well, given the right circumstances, anyone can be fooled.

345
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:45,610
Ooh!  What do you say to another dance?

346
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:49,143
No thanks, it's getting late and I've danced enough.

347
00:20:49,143 --> 00:20:54,352
Alright, then!  I'll just go powder my nose and then we'll be off.

348
00:21:03,364 --> 00:21:04,688
Niles?

349
00:21:04,688 --> 00:21:06,285
No, no, please.

350
00:21:06,285 --> 00:21:09,726
Claire Barnes?  I was an associate in your attorney's office.

351
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:12,623
Oh, yes, Claire.  Uh, it's good to see you again.

352
00:21:12,623 --> 00:21:14,390
Well, I heard about you and Maris.

353
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:19,288
And I just wanted to give you my card and tell you you're free to call me anytime.

354
00:21:19,288 --> 00:21:21,849
Oh, thank you, but I'm happy with my attorney.

355
00:21:21,849 --> 00:21:25,916
I meant to go dancing.

356
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:28,865
OH...Thanks..

357
00:21:31,668 --> 00:21:33,390
Well, are you ready?

358
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:36,034
Ah..

359
00:21:36,034 --> 00:21:37,420
No, I don't think I am.

360
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,559
I beg your pardon?

361
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:41,780
Er, I mean yes.  Uh, let's go.

362
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:44,334
Well, we certainly had fun tonight, didn't we?

363
00:21:44,334 --> 00:21:45,736
We certainly did.

364
00:21:45,736 --> 00:21:48,950
And to think you almost didn't come to the ball!

365
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:54,553
You know, it's such a shame when people let fear stop them from trying new things.

366
00:21:55,133 --> 00:21:58,035
Excuse me.

367
00:22:02,658 --> 00:22:05,441
I'm ready now.
