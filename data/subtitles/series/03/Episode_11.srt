1
00:00:09,761 --> 00:00:11,517
Ah, Niles.
Hello.

2
00:00:11,517 --> 00:00:15,844
Is it just me, or are the sidewalk Santas getting pushy?

3
00:00:15,844 --> 00:00:21,739
Well, tomorrow is Christmas.  I suppose they might be expecting a little downturn after that.

4
00:00:21,739 --> 00:00:24,188
Cappuccino, please.

5
00:00:24,188 --> 00:00:27,280
So?  When does Frederick arrive?

6
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:30,868
In six hours and twenty-one minutes.  Not that I'm the least bit excited.

7
00:00:30,868 --> 00:00:32,394
Yes, I'm sure he's excited too.

8
00:00:32,394 --> 00:00:34,121
First Christmas at daddy's.

9
00:00:34,121 --> 00:00:36,721
I imagine he has visions of sugarplums dancing through his head.

10
00:00:36,721 --> 00:00:42,499
No, Lilith doesn't allow sweets, he's probably got visions of bran.

11
00:00:42,499 --> 00:00:45,702
Well, I've got my own reasons to celebrate.

12
00:00:45,702 --> 00:00:48,522
Maris and I may be together again, by the new year.

13
00:00:48,522 --> 00:00:49,803
Oh, really Niles?
Yep, yeah.

14
00:00:49,803 --> 00:00:52,938
I called this morning to arrange the delivery of her Christmas gift,

15
00:00:52,938 --> 00:00:57,616
and she said the only gift she'd accept from me was an abject apology.

16
00:00:57,616 --> 00:00:59,077
Going to cave into her, aren't you?

17
00:00:59,077 --> 00:01:07,464
Au contraire.  I told her I was not about to apologise,
and from that point on, the respect in her voice came through loud and clear.

18
00:01:07,464 --> 00:01:14,146
No small feat, considering at the time she was speaking at the time through the hole in her massage table.

19
00:01:14,146 --> 00:01:14,858
Oh, hi Roz.

20
00:01:14,858 --> 00:01:20,664
Hey. Double espresso, please.  This last-minute Christmas shopping is killing me.

21
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:22,661
I never know what to give the men in my life.

22
00:01:22,661 --> 00:01:26,445
Since when?

23
00:01:26,445 --> 00:01:28,569
Ha, ha.  Funny man.

24
00:01:28,569 --> 00:01:30,176
Excuse me, I'll take care of this.

25
00:01:30,176 --> 00:01:31,759
Oh, thank you Niles.

26
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,994
What's new, Niles?

27
00:01:34,994 --> 00:01:39,983
I have been keeping it under wraps but, Maris and I have separated.

28
00:01:39,983 --> 00:01:44,731
Oh, my God!  I had no idea.  I can't believe no-one told me.

29
00:01:44,731 --> 00:01:49,430
This is such a surprise!
That's enough, Talulah.

30
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:52,062
You're not fooling anyone.

31
00:01:52,062 --> 00:01:54,777
I'm sorry sir, your card didn't clear.

32
00:01:54,777 --> 00:01:56,360
I have to do this.

33
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:59,237
Wait, wait!  What are you doing?

34
00:01:59,237 --> 00:02:04,272
The computer said "credit cancelled by order of co-signatory."

35
00:02:04,272 --> 00:02:06,414
Maris has cancelled your credit card.

36
00:02:06,414 --> 00:02:09,744
Whoa, Merry Christmas!

37
00:02:09,744 --> 00:02:11,108
Would you care to use a different one?

38
00:02:11,108 --> 00:02:14,245
There's no point, they're all in her name.

39
00:02:14,245 --> 00:02:17,151
I'm calling her right now and demanding the restoration of my credit card.

40
00:02:17,151 --> 00:02:19,088
And my bank accounts.

41
00:02:19,088 --> 00:02:23,237
And my phone service!

44
00:02:33,471 --> 00:02:40,612
That-that's not it.  I'm supposed to be flying home to Newark for Christmas,
but the flight the next gate over has a flight to Maui.

45
00:02:40,612 --> 00:02:44,538
I'm telling you, it's calling me, Doc.

46
00:02:44,538 --> 00:02:47,262
Why are you hesitant to go home?

47
00:02:47,262 --> 00:02:49,429
Because it's the same thing every year.

48
00:02:49,429 --> 00:02:53,048
I travel three thousand miles to sit down at the dinner table with my family,

49
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:54,938
and what do we talk about?

50
00:02:54,938 --> 00:02:56,931
What's going on in out lives?  No.

51
00:02:56,931 --> 00:02:58,966
Our hopes and dreams?  No.

52
00:02:58,966 --> 00:03:00,913
We talk about the turkey.

53
00:03:00,913 --> 00:03:04,096
"Boy, that's quite a bird."
"Twenty-four pounder."

54
00:03:04,096 --> 00:03:07,611
"What time did you have to get up to put that in the oven,  Ange?"

55
00:03:07,611 --> 00:03:12,218
"Oh boy, that's moist.  You must have been basting that bird all day."

56
00:03:12,218 --> 00:03:14,683
"Are those walnuts in the stuffing?"

57
00:03:14,683 --> 00:03:18,554
"Oh god, I forgot to put the rolls in the oven."

58
00:03:18,554 --> 00:03:24,762
I guess what I'm trying to say, Bob, is that we're all in the same gravy boat.

59
00:03:24,762 --> 00:03:29,137
But you see, the important thing is that we spend time with our loved ones.

60
00:03:29,137 --> 00:03:34,796
Just think how you'd feel if you woke up tomorrow morning six thousand miles away from your home.

61
00:03:34,796 --> 00:03:38,104
Well, I tell ya, that really puts it in perspective, doc.

62
00:03:38,104 --> 00:03:39,428
I got a plane to catch.

63
00:03:39,428 --> 00:03:44,727
Mele Keleke Maka, Bob.

64
00:03:44,727 --> 00:03:49,022
We'll be right back after these messages.

65
00:03:49,022 --> 00:03:50,267
Oh, Roz.  What did they say, what did they say?

66
00:03:50,267 --> 00:03:54,625
Oh, relax.  Frederick's flight is still on time, he'll be here in less than three hours.

67
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:57,001
Oh, and the florist called, you can pick up your wreath on the way home.

68
00:03:57,001 --> 00:04:03,273
Oh, fabulous.  You know, every year Dad puts that kitschy creature with the lightbulb nose on the door.

69
00:04:03,273 --> 00:04:05,081
Hey, great party.

70
00:04:05,081 --> 00:04:08,240
Best one ever, thanks to me.  I hired a stripper!

71
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:12,358
Doc, you will never guess what her name is

72
00:04:12,358 --> 00:04:15,833
Candy Kane.

73
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:19,942
What are the odds?

74
00:04:19,942 --> 00:04:25,227
For those of you who have not yet sampled the punch,
here is my capsule review:

75
00:04:25,227 --> 00:04:34,009
vile bouquet, unwholesome colour, ghastly taste - and a kick that is simply heaven.

76
00:04:34,009 --> 00:04:35,644
OK, 30 seconds,  
Out!

77
00:04:35,644 --> 00:04:37,266
All right people, out, out, please.

78
00:04:37,266 --> 00:04:39,927
Hey, Roz.  You know what's over my head?

79
00:04:39,927 --> 00:04:43,757
Almost any clever remark?

80
00:04:43,757 --> 00:04:46,483
What's she mean by that?

81
00:04:46,483 --> 00:04:49,090
Oh, listen Roz.

82
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:52,703
I know you've got a plane to catch and the traffic to the airport is probably very bad,

83
00:04:52,703 --> 00:04:55,257
so in the spirit of the Christmas season,

84
00:04:55,257 --> 00:04:57,119
why don't you just take off early, hmm?

85
00:04:57,119 --> 00:05:00,788
You're going to read one of your inspirational Christmas fables again, aren't you?

86
00:05:00,788 --> 00:05:05,579
Yes, I am.  Be a lot easier without you sitting over there sticking your finger in your throat.

87
00:05:05,579 --> 00:05:06,803
Right.  Merry Christmas.

88
00:05:06,803 --> 00:05:08,057
Merry Christmas, Roz.

89
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:08,709
Say "Hi" to Frederick.

90
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:12,403
Yes, and say "Hi" to your mom for me.
Will do.

91
00:05:12,403 --> 00:05:16,433
Hi, we're back.  As most of my faithful listeners know,

92
00:05:16,433 --> 00:05:25,778
every year I compose a parable that I hope will illuminate the spirit of the Christmas season.

93
00:05:28,763 --> 00:05:38,689
So without any further ado, I give you "The Story of Olaf, the lonely little goatherd."

94
00:05:42,911 --> 00:05:48,068
"Once upon a time, there lived a lonely little goatherd.

95
00:05:48,068 --> 00:05:57,759
He had no family, and no playthings, so to amuse himself, one day he carved a little wooden flute."

96
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:02,556
"A flute that he used to play during the long, lonely evenings.

97
00:06:02,556 --> 00:06:08,627
And the tune it made was very lovely, and all the people in the village below could hear the pure, glorious sound..."

98
00:06:08,627 --> 00:06:17,348
This is all very amusing, but nothing you can do is going to distract me!

99
00:06:17,348 --> 00:06:27,669
"One day, the son of a wealthy merchant heard the music,
and while that boy had all the toys in the world, he was jealous of this little goatherd's flute."

100
00:06:27,669 --> 00:06:33,899
"So one dark- night, one dark-  -windy night..."

101
00:06:33,899 --> 00:06:39,288
"The merchant's son stole his precious instrument, but when he took that flute home,

102
00:06:39,288 --> 00:06:43,333
he couldn't make it play.  So he smashed the flute to bits."

103
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:49,351
"When the little goatherd came down the mountain the next day, and saw his flute was broken..."

104
00:06:49,351 --> 00:06:53,053
YIKES!

105
00:06:53,053 --> 00:06:54,891
"He might have said that..."

106
00:06:54,891 --> 00:06:57,890
"But instead he forgave the merchant's son.

107
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:01,476
And the wealthy merchant adopted the little goatherd, and..."

108
00:07:01,476 --> 00:07:05,317
OH, MAMA! ?"

109
00:07:05,317 --> 00:07:13,834
he said, upon meeting the merchant's wife...
"And somewhere along the way, he learned the true meaning of Christmas."

110
00:07:13,834 --> 00:07:20,371
This is Dr. Frasier Crane, wishing you a truly blessed and forgiving holiday.

111
00:07:20,371 --> 00:07:25,643
There now, you see?  Nice try.  Miss Kane's delightful performance aside,

112
00:07:25,643 --> 00:07:30,211
this just proves the power of my message cannot be stayed.

113
00:07:30,211 --> 00:07:33,686
Oh for God's sakes, what am I, a robot?

114
00:07:38,085 --> 00:07:41,497
And to all a good night.

115
00:07:44,412 --> 00:07:46,954
IF I ONLY HAD A BRAIN

116
00:07:54,101 --> 00:07:58,138
Hi, Dad.  Ah,

117
00:07:58,138 --> 00:08:00,190
I'm going to put this wreath up here.

118
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:01,288
What's the matter with Rudolph?

119
00:08:01,288 --> 00:08:06,100
Well Dad, you know, I just think that Christmas decorations should be understated and tasteful.

120
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:09,941
Boy, I can't get one thing that I want.

121
00:08:09,941 --> 00:08:15,215
Dad, I'm sorry, but if I gave you one thing, God knows where it might lead.

122
00:08:27,055 --> 00:08:32,351
Oh, God... it's my childhood Christmases all over again.

123
00:08:32,351 --> 00:08:36,663
Only now Mom isn't here to say, "Shut up, you'll hurt his feelings."

124
00:08:36,663 --> 00:08:40,204
Oh, don't be such a Grinch.

125
00:08:40,204 --> 00:08:43,390
Ho, Ho, Ho!

126
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:46,544
It works when you step on the mat. 
Ho, Ho, Ho!

127
00:08:46,544 --> 00:08:49,698
It can say "Ho, Ho, Ho", "Merry Christmas", or "Happy Holidays."

128
00:08:49,698 --> 00:08:54,581
Yeah, well I hope it can say "Geronimo" because I'm going to throw him off the balcony!

129
00:08:54,581 --> 00:08:57,659
Well, I don't care what you think, it's not for you, it's for Frederick.

130
00:08:57,659 --> 00:09:02,540
God, I suppose you're right, Dad.  I used to love this stuff when I was six.

131
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:05,968
By the time I was seven I started to have questions.

132
00:09:05,968 --> 00:09:13,569
When I was eight I started spending a lot more time at the Bernsteins.

133
00:09:13,569 --> 00:09:16,445
Well, I'm off to Joe's parents' house.

134
00:09:16,445 --> 00:09:17,796
I see you've been busy in the kitchen.

135
00:09:17,796 --> 00:09:21,347
Yes.  I'm bringing Grammy Moon's famous plum duff.

136
00:09:21,347 --> 00:09:25,398
It's a still flour pudding boiled in a cloth bag.

137
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:28,317
Who gets to lick the bag?

138
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:31,316
No.  You see, Grammy Moon had a secret ingredient.

139
00:09:31,316 --> 00:09:36,351
She'd soak it for hours in rum, then ignite it in a blinding flash.

140
00:09:36,351 --> 00:09:41,557
As soon as she came out of the kitchen with no eyebrows, we knew dessert was ready

141
00:09:41,557 --> 00:09:47,266
You know, to this day the smell of burning hair puts me in the holiday spirit.

142
00:09:47,266 --> 00:09:51,282
Bye, Merry Christmas. 
Merry Christmas.

143
00:09:51,282 --> 00:09:55,152
You know, someone's got to go back down to the storeroom, there's still something missing.

144
00:09:55,152 --> 00:10:01,056
You must be kidding, Dad.  My God, this place couldn't look any more ludicrous.

145
00:10:08,367 --> 00:10:15,162
Once I saw how those white hairs on his chin looked like a beard, the rest of the idea just fell into place.

146
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:23,793
Niles.
Hello, Frasier...

147
00:10:23,793 --> 00:10:28,506
I know, I know - "Shut up, we'll hurt his feelings."

148
00:10:28,506 --> 00:10:31,463
So, Niles, did you have a discussion with Maris?

149
00:10:31,463 --> 00:10:34,100
No, but! - I had an epiphany.

150
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:39,995
I realised, cutting off my funds is Maris's way of saying, "I love you!"

151
00:10:39,995 --> 00:10:46,446
She always uses money to get what she wants; ergo, this is proof she wants me back!  What do you think?

152
00:10:46,446 --> 00:10:51,207
Ho, Ho, Ho!

153
00:10:51,207 --> 00:10:55,712
I think Santa's said it all for us.

154
00:11:03,217 --> 00:11:08,706
Dad, you have to get out more.

155
00:11:08,706 --> 00:11:12,100
You've started doing old lady things.

156
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,666
It's for Frederick!

157
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:16,160
Oh, of course it is.

158
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:20,260
Oh, that reminds me, I don't want to impose, but may I ride with you to the airport to pick up Frederick?

159
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:24,306
Of course you may, Niles. Just have to wrap up his presents first.

160
00:11:24,306 --> 00:11:25,651
So what did you get Freddie?

161
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:31,943
Well actually dad, I ordered him the toy catalogue, from the special section called "Gifts for the Gifted."

162
00:11:31,943 --> 00:11:35,907
I got him the junior astronomy set, and the geology lab

163
00:11:35,907 --> 00:11:38,776
oh, and a fabulous thing called the "Living Brain."

164
00:11:38,776 --> 00:11:43,614
You get to paint each lobe a different colour, then you stuff it inside the Living Skull.

165
00:11:43,614 --> 00:11:45,229
Hey, you know what kids really like?

166
00:11:45,229 --> 00:11:48,367
They've been advertising it like crazy on TV.  It's great.

167
00:11:48,367 --> 00:11:52,414
The Outlaw Laser Robo Geek.

168
00:11:52,414 --> 00:11:57,182
Its head lights up and it shoots death rays out of its eyes.

169
00:11:57,182 --> 00:12:00,554
Yeah.  A little like that.

170
00:12:02,063 --> 00:12:04,302
Listen Dad, I think I know what Frederick likes.

171
00:12:04,302 --> 00:12:05,894
He's precocious, he needs to be challenged.

172
00:12:05,894 --> 00:12:08,277
Oh, challenge him the other 364 days.

173
00:12:08,277 --> 00:12:12,036
One day out of the year, indulge him.  Let him be a kid.

174
00:12:12,036 --> 00:12:17,620
Dad, I'm sorry, if Frederick's anything like me, the kind of toys he'll like to play with are...

175
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:22,127
A kitchen set, a dollhouse and three kinds of Barbies!

176
00:12:22,127 --> 00:12:26,137
This is for a Franklin Crane from Kenibunkport

177
00:12:26,137 --> 00:12:27,586
God, you realise what this means?!

178
00:12:27,586 --> 00:12:37,142
Yes.  The Cranes of Maine have got your "Living Brain."

179
00:12:38,043 --> 00:12:40,777
No.

180
00:12:40,777 --> 00:12:42,534
It means I don't have anything for Freddie.

181
00:12:42,534 --> 00:12:44,843
God, I wanted everything to be so perfect.

182
00:12:44,843 --> 00:12:46,517
Now he's going to have a horrible Christmas.

183
00:12:46,517 --> 00:12:49,036
listen, it's OK.  There's a big toy store in the mall.

184
00:12:49,036 --> 00:12:51,315
They're open late tonight.  Just don't worry about it.

185
00:12:51,315 --> 00:12:52,750
Well, that's easy for you to say, Dad.

186
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:59,857
My God, it's Christmas Eve, the gifts I ordered are three thousand miles away,
my son is due in an hour, and on top of it all I have to go to a mall!

187
00:12:59,857 --> 00:13:01,798
Ho, Ho, Ho!

188
00:13:01,798 --> 00:13:04,557
Oh, don't look at me, he said it.

189
00:13:08,036 --> 00:13:11,529
A MALL AND THE NIGHT VISITORS

190
00:13:13,096 --> 00:13:16,814
Niles, customers are marauding through here like a pack of feral dogs.

191
00:13:16,814 --> 00:13:19,662
Did you see that woman?  She practically knocked me over on her way to the escalator.

192
00:13:19,662 --> 00:13:23,928
Well, how about that woman near the cosmetics counter who tried to mace me?

193
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:28,174
That was a cologne sample, Niles.  That's what they do.

194
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:31,222
Now listen, we've got five minutes.  We've got to find a sales clerk.

195
00:13:31,222 --> 00:13:32,575
Oh well, good luck.

196
00:13:32,575 --> 00:13:34,924
All right, we'd better find something ourselves, I guess.

197
00:13:34,924 --> 00:13:37,586
Well hey, hey.  This looks amusing.

198
00:13:37,586 --> 00:13:41,303
Niles, may I remind you we're looking for something educational?

199
00:13:41,303 --> 00:13:44,077
Oh, oh, oh, oh, it has buttons.

200
00:13:44,077 --> 00:13:46,681
What's it doing?

201
00:13:46,681 --> 00:13:47,953
It's flashing.

202
00:13:47,953 --> 00:13:52,680
Niles, please remember that Freddie tested in the highest percentile for cognitive skills and deductive reasoning.

203
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:55,260
What's it doing now?

204
00:13:55,260 --> 00:14:03,340
It's beeping, for God's sake!  And as much as I'd like to inflict this on Lilith, I'm looking for fast and educational,
all right?

205
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:08,388
I wonder what else it does?

206
00:14:08,388 --> 00:14:12,021
Let's see if it protects your head!

207
00:14:17,236 --> 00:14:19,721
Ooh, here's something.

208
00:14:19,721 --> 00:14:21,182
Look at this, look at this.

209
00:14:21,182 --> 00:14:21,674
Oh, God.

210
00:14:21,674 --> 00:14:24,321
It's called "Ecto Goo."

211
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:26,322
Oh well, that sounds vaguely scientific

212
00:14:26,322 --> 00:14:28,590
but what could he possibly learn from that?

213
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:32,291
Well, for starters, he can learn never to wear Armani to a toy store.

214
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:35,747
Let's see, I'll just have to remember what I ordered from the catalogue and look for that.

215
00:14:35,747 --> 00:14:37,453
First, the "Living Brain."

216
00:14:37,453 --> 00:14:42,102
Living Brain?  What kind of dork wants that?

217
00:14:42,102 --> 00:14:47,944
With any luck, the kind of dork who'll be operating on your prostate someday.

218
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:53,260
Frasier, Frasier, Frasier.

219
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:56,448
Look, look, look, there it is.  It's up on the shelf, it's up on the shelf.
Oh, marvelous.

220
00:14:56,448 --> 00:14:58,773
Oh, Lord.  It's covered with dust.

221
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:03,027
The brain is dusty.  Could there be a clearer metaphor?

222
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:05,063
Oh, Lord.  There's nothing in it.

223
00:15:05,063 --> 00:15:05,890
Can I have it?

224
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:06,938
It's an empty box, Ma'am.

225
00:15:06,938 --> 00:15:09,451
I know, but I can put my son's Robo Geek in it.

226
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:14,489
You know how scared he'll be when he thinks he's getting something this nerdy?

227
00:15:14,489 --> 00:15:17,114
Oh God, this is hopeless.  We'll never find anything for Frederick.

228
00:15:17,114 --> 00:15:19,710
Oh, Frasier.  Just give him a cheque.

229
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,868
But Niles, you can't give a cheque to a child.

230
00:15:21,868 --> 00:15:23,910
That's what I'm giving him.

231
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:26,667
It has a stagecoach on it.

232
00:15:26,667 --> 00:15:29,693
Niles, Maris cancelled your account.

233
00:15:29,693 --> 00:15:32,002
Damn!

234
00:15:32,002 --> 00:15:35,589
Oh, look.  Look at that man's bag.  "Young Minds."

235
00:15:35,589 --> 00:15:38,365
Sir, excuse me, is this store  in the mall?

236
00:15:38,365 --> 00:15:39,459
Yeah.

237
00:15:39,459 --> 00:15:41,059
And it's educational toys?

238
00:15:41,059 --> 00:15:43,400
Mmm-hmm, nothing but.  It's just a couple of doors down.

239
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,105
Yes!  Petunia, there is a Santa Claus.

240
00:15:45,105 --> 00:15:48,175
No, they closed a half hour ago.

241
00:15:48,175 --> 00:15:55,108
Damn.  Look, this is perfect, look a chemistry lab, and a picture puzzle and...

242
00:15:55,108 --> 00:15:58,128
You know, my son comes in, in half an hour and I've absolutely nothing for him.

243
00:15:58,128 --> 00:16:01,541
He'll be in, in 22 minutes if he picks up a good tailwind.

244
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:03,686
You ahh, you really need this stuff bad, don't you?

245
00:16:03,686 --> 00:16:07,375
Oh, you have no idea, it would save my life.

246
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:08,867
I'll tell you what.

247
00:16:08,867 --> 00:16:10,271
Seeing as how it's Christmas...

248
00:16:10,271 --> 00:16:11,819
Oh, God bless you, sir.

249
00:16:11,819 --> 00:16:15,651
A thousand bucks.

250
00:16:15,651 --> 00:16:18,018
What?!  A thousand bucks?

251
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:19,235
Hey, take it or leave it.

252
00:16:19,235 --> 00:16:22,857
Well, I mean, there's just no more than a hundred dollars worth of things here.

253
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:26,671
"Ladies and gentlemen, we're beginning our descent into Seattle airport."

254
00:16:26,671 --> 00:16:28,066
I'm just trying to do you a favour here.

255
00:16:28,066 --> 00:16:29,577
Well, it's some favour.

256
00:16:29,577 --> 00:16:31,845
"Please make sure your tables and seats are in their full and upright position."

257
00:16:31,845 --> 00:16:33,284
Shut up, Niles!

258
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:37,621
All right, all right, lets see what I've got here.

259
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:40,545
All right, I've got, ahh... Here's three hundred dollars.

260
00:16:40,545 --> 00:16:43,391
Would you-would you accept a personal cheque for the rest?

261
00:16:43,391 --> 00:16:45,426
Hey, it's Christmas.

262
00:16:45,426 --> 00:16:48,110
Oh, bless you, bless you so much.  Very well, thank you.

263
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:52,170
Niles, give the man a cheque.

264
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,269
Where's Freddie?

265
00:16:56,269 --> 00:16:59,919
Putting on his pajamas.  Told me he would come in and say goodnight after he brushes his teeth.

266
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:00,993
So how'd you do?

267
00:17:00,993 --> 00:17:04,260
Well, I didn't get exactly what I'd ordered, but I think I did all right.

268
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:09,099
I got him a microscope, a chemistry set,

269
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:13,800
and a five thousand piece puzzle of the Great Wall of China.

270
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:17,957
Well, maybe he'll have fun with the boxes.

271
00:17:17,957 --> 00:17:23,082
Dad, here you go, this is the last box from the storeroom.

272
00:17:25,146 --> 00:17:26,301
Now, was this what you were looking for?

273
00:17:26,301 --> 00:17:28,734
Oh, yeah.

274
00:17:28,734 --> 00:17:31,409
Santa's legs for the chimney, you remember these babies?

275
00:17:31,409 --> 00:17:39,298
Oh, yes.  Inspired some spectacular Christmas nightmares the year I found them under your bed.

276
00:17:39,298 --> 00:17:44,623
Frasier, isn't this the  smoking jacket you gave Dad a few years back?

277
00:17:44,623 --> 00:17:50,023
What?  Hey... How did that get in there?

278
00:17:50,023 --> 00:17:53,856
Dad, these are all of the gifts I've given you for the last six years.

279
00:17:53,856 --> 00:17:57,445
Hey, c'mon now, shut the- put 'em back.  Close the box, will ya?

280
00:17:57,445 --> 00:18:00,833
Dad, look at this.  My God, they're still in the original boxes, never been worn.

281
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:02,074
Sure they have.

282
00:18:02,074 --> 00:18:04,991
Oh, yeah. This one still has the tags on it.

283
00:18:04,991 --> 00:18:08,142
Look, this isn't the kind of conversation we should be having on Christmas eve.

284
00:18:08,142 --> 00:18:12,624
No, Dad?  Well, what was it you wanted to say?

285
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:19,493
Well, you know Frasier, you're always giving people things you think they should like,
instead of things that they really like.

286
00:18:19,493 --> 00:18:21,345
I mean, come on -

287
00:18:21,345 --> 00:18:25,438
In your entire life, have you ever seen me wear anything like that?

288
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:28,515
Well, no.  I thought you might like a change.

289
00:18:28,515 --> 00:18:31,626
Well, it's like when you were a kid, remember?

290
00:18:31,626 --> 00:18:36,797
I wanted you to love baseball.  I wanted to get you a bat, glove, everything, for Christmas.

291
00:18:36,797 --> 00:18:40,700
But you had your mind set on a microscope, so that's what I got you.

292
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:52,525
And then when Dad took us to a game, you spent the whole time looking for rodent hairs in your hot-dog.

293
00:18:52,525 --> 00:18:57,837
I'm just saying Christmas isn't the time you try to mold somebody,
which is what you're trying to do with Frederick.

294
00:18:57,837 --> 00:18:59,934
I think I know what's good for my own son.

295
00:18:59,934 --> 00:19:01,362
I brushed my teeth, Daddy.

296
00:19:01,362 --> 00:19:04,600
Oh, that's my boy.  Come on.

297
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:08,086
Bonsoir, Uncle Niles.
Et toi aussi.

298
00:19:08,086 --> 00:19:09,713
Hey, you'd better get to sleep, or Santa won't come.

299
00:19:09,713 --> 00:19:13,242
OK.  I know just what Santa's bringing me this year, Dad.

300
00:19:13,242 --> 00:19:16,032
I bet you don't.

301
00:19:16,032 --> 00:19:22,625
Yes I do too.  It's an Outlaw Laser Robo Geek.

302
00:19:24,767 --> 00:19:26,485
What makes you think that?

303
00:19:26,485 --> 00:19:28,927
Because I asked Santa for it in my letter.

304
00:19:28,927 --> 00:19:32,255
They are sooo cool.

305
00:19:32,255 --> 00:19:35,407
Ahh, listen ahh, Frederick,

306
00:19:35,407 --> 00:19:38,130
there's erm... Frederick, where are you going?

307
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:43,175
I'm going to make myself fall asleep right away, so the next thing I know, it'll be morning.

308
00:19:43,175 --> 00:19:44,220
Goodnight, Daddy.

309
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,718
I'll come in and tuck you in, in a minute.

310
00:19:45,718 --> 00:19:47,510
Goodnight, Grandpa.  Goodnight, Uncle Niles.

311
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:48,196
Goodnight.

312
00:19:48,196 --> 00:19:52,886
Goodnight, Frederick.  I'm going to go home and go to bed too.

313
00:19:52,886 --> 00:19:57,351
I hope Aunt Maris comes out of her coma.

314
00:20:06,967 --> 00:20:12,524
He asked where she was, I thought the truth would just upset him.

315
00:20:12,524 --> 00:20:14,391
I'll see you in the morning.  Merry Christmas.

316
00:20:14,391 --> 00:20:16,992
See you tomorrow.

317
00:20:17,896 --> 00:20:20,016
Well, this is turning out to be quite a Christmas.

318
00:20:20,016 --> 00:20:23,691
Oh, it's going to be fine.

319
00:20:23,691 --> 00:20:25,640
Done it again.

320
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:28,695
Gotten everyone the wrong gifts.

321
00:20:28,695 --> 00:20:31,899
What is it about me?

322
00:20:31,899 --> 00:20:34,357
Well, here, you might as well open your gift now.

323
00:20:34,357 --> 00:20:36,147
No reason for everyone to be disappointed tomorrow.

324
00:20:36,147 --> 00:20:38,972
Hey, I'm sure I'm gonna love it.

325
00:20:38,972 --> 00:20:43,957
I doubt it.  Not exactly my night.

326
00:20:45,114 --> 00:20:49,288
Hey!  A robe!  Great, I love it!

327
00:20:49,288 --> 00:20:55,140
No, you don't.  It's not a robe, it's a dressing gown.

328
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:57,415
Noel Coward would love it, but it's not you.

329
00:20:57,415 --> 00:21:00,070
Hey, I love Noel Coward!

330
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:01,720
Dad, you're overcompensating.

331
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:05,755
Some people are hard to buy for, I'm sorry.

332
00:21:05,755 --> 00:21:09,331
But, you know, you are too, I never know what to get you.

333
00:21:09,331 --> 00:21:11,540
Here.

334
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:14,605
You might as well open this now.

335
00:21:16,224 --> 00:21:20,617
Yeah.  Guess it was easier when I was small.

336
00:21:20,617 --> 00:21:23,055
'Cause kids always know what they want, don't they?

337
00:21:23,055 --> 00:21:26,579
Yeah, yeah.  It's rough for adults.

338
00:21:31,277 --> 00:21:32,843
Oh, Dad...

339
00:21:32,843 --> 00:21:36,937
Merry Christmas, son.

340
00:21:36,937 --> 00:21:39,038
How did you know?  It's jut what I always wanted:

341
00:21:39,038 --> 00:21:45,779
My very own Outlaw Laser Robo Geek.

342
00:21:46,357 --> 00:21:50,774
Oh, Dad - oh, oh, listen, are the batteries included?

343
00:21:50,774 --> 00:21:54,465
In the box.
Oh, Dad!
