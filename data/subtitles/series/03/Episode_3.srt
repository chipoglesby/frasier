1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,100
Well, we have time for
one more caller. Roz?

2
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,620
We have Ed on line three.

3
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,150
Hello, Ed, I'm listening.

4
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:22,720
Ed? Ed?

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,200
Well, we seem to have lost Ed.

6
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,240
Let's take another caller.
On line four we have...

7
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,570
Roz?

8
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:38,910
Roz?

9
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:41,830
We have...

10
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:46,010
Eye... Lean.
Oh, Eileen.

11
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:51,900
<i>-Hello Eileen, I'm listening.
-Dr. Crane...</i>

12
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,389
<i>I've been very happily married
for twenty years...</i>

13
00:00:54,424 --> 00:00:57,420
<i>...and I wouldn't dream
of cheating but lately...</i>

14
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:01,720
<i>...when we're making love I find
myself fantasizing about...</i>

15
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:05,530
<i>-...people other than my husband.
-Well, that's perfectly normal.</i>

16
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:09,900
It's quite normal to spice up one's
love life by imagining a tryst with...

17
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:14,970
<i>-...a sports figure or a movie star
or... -Or a radio psychiatrist?</i>

18
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,000
<i>-Excuse me?
-It's your voice, Dr. Crane.</i>

19
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:23,302
<i>You must have the most
sensuous voice on earth.</i>

20
00:01:23,337 --> 00:01:26,150
Oh, I don't know, Eileen.

21
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:31,870
<i>I've never seen your picture.
Would you mind describing yourself?</i>

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,301
Oh, well I don't really
think that's appropriate...

23
00:01:33,336 --> 00:01:35,800
-I'll do it.
-Roz, I don't think...

24
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:42,320
He's about six-one, with a granite jaw
and the broad shoulders of a marine.

25
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:44,369
He's been wearing
his hair short lately...

26
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:48,130
...but that only accentuates
his cobalt blue eyes...

27
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:52,430
...his chiseled cheekbones
and his full, provocative lips.

28
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:56,310
<i>Wow! Thanks Roz.</i>

29
00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:00,410
<i>And thank you, Dr. Crane.
I'll be thinking of you tonight.</i>

30
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:03,540
<i>With any luck, twice!</i>

31
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:14,210
Well, this is Dr. Frasier Crane feeling
a little red in his chiseled cheeks.

32
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:18,500
Till tomorrow then,
this is KACL 780 AM.

33
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,548
Roz, that was quite
a flattering description.

34
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:27,440
You know, just out of curiosity...

35
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,168
Were you just helping
that lady with her fantasy...

36
00:02:29,203 --> 00:02:31,930
...or do you really
see me that way?

37
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:36,330
You really don't
know, do you?

38
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:42,130
Frasier, I am so attracted
to you, I always have been.

39
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:45,320
Your looks, your voice...

40
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,196
You don't know how many times
I've wanted to strip naked...

41
00:02:48,231 --> 00:02:50,300
...and hurl myself
at that glass partition...

42
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:53,580
...like a bug on a windshield.

43
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:58,000
-Are you through?
-Well, ask a stupid question!

44
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:04,730
All right Roz,
I will see you tomorrow.

45
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:06,141
Hey, aren't you going
to the staff meeting?

46
00:03:06,176 --> 00:03:08,730
No, no, no, just tell them
that my aunt died.

47
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:12,540
I'm off to her lawyer's now,
she put me in charge of her memorial.

48
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,211
-Oh, I'm so sorry.
-Oh, don't be.

49
00:03:14,246 --> 00:03:17,750
She was a dreadful old harpy.
Life around her was miserable.

50
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,446
That should look nice
on her headstone.

51
00:03:19,481 --> 00:03:22,260
Well, I don't mean
any disrespect but...

52
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,583
...the entire time I knew her
she never said anything to me...

53
00:03:24,618 --> 00:03:27,200
...that wasn't scornful,
derisive or contemptuous.

54
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,100
So how come she made you
in charge of her memorial?

55
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,700
I was her favourite!

56
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:41,530
-Evening all.
-Hello.

57
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,120
Dad, I thought we
had an agreement.

58
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:47,554
Eddie doesn't roll
around on the sofa...

59
00:03:47,589 --> 00:03:50,550
...and I don't throw him
in front of a bus!

60
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,940
-Hello, Daphne.
-Oh, hello Dr. Crane.

61
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:57,650
-Will you be joining us for dinner?
-If it's not too much trouble.

62
00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:59,438
It's Maris's night to
host her book club...

63
00:03:59,473 --> 00:04:01,450
...and they are more comfortable
not having a man there.

64
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:04,240
Yes, apparently Niles makes
the ladies self-conscious.

65
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,720
Well, I sat in on
the last discussion...

66
00:04:05,755 --> 00:04:08,420
...and Mrs. Esterbrook-Kindred
developed a facial tic...

67
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:11,320
...every time she had to
say the word "Balzac."

68
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:15,847
So how did it go with
Aunt Louise's lawyer?

69
00:04:15,882 --> 00:04:18,650
Did you get the old bat's
affairs straightened out?

70
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:21,560
Ask her yourself.

71
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:27,942
Apparently, it was
Aunt Louise's wish...

72
00:04:27,977 --> 00:04:29,950
...that Niles dispose of her ashes.

73
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:32,100
Now the pressure's on me to
find the perfect place for her...

74
00:04:32,135 --> 00:04:34,310
...to rest for eternity. I haven't the
faintest idea what to do with her.

75
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:37,160
Why don't you just
flush her down the toilet?

76
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:41,150
-Mr. Crane, you can't do that!
-Why not? She loved the water.

77
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:46,460
Oh, oh, that's it: the beach.
Oh, no, no, she hated seagulls.

78
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:48,870
And vice-versa.

79
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,980
Oh, oh, oh... no!

80
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:57,130
It doesn't matter where I pick...

81
00:04:57,165 --> 00:04:58,621
...you know it's not going
to be good enough.

82
00:04:58,656 --> 00:05:01,250
Whatever I did she
always found fault.

83
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:03,058
Remember when I used
to mow her lawn?

84
00:05:03,093 --> 00:05:06,740
Yes, what about the
Christmas tree I bought her?

85
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:08,602
The ashtray I made at camp?

86
00:05:08,637 --> 00:05:12,530
"Is that the best you
can do? It wobbles!"

87
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:17,200
I wish I had that ashtray now!

88
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:24,940
-So when's the memorial service?
-It's two weeks after tomorrow.

89
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:29,040
Lucky lucky me, her last request
was that I deliver the eulogy.

90
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:30,748
Oh come on now, you can handle it.

91
00:05:30,783 --> 00:05:32,982
You just stand up there
and say a few nice things.

92
00:05:33,017 --> 00:05:33,910
There aren't any!

93
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,582
Then just make them up. Everyone
lies a little in eulogies.

94
00:05:36,617 --> 00:05:40,370
No Daphne, I refuse to invent
virtues the woman didn't have.

95
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:44,170
I'll just have to find something
good I can honestly say about her.

96
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:49,370
Good luck! She was nothing but
a crabby, tight-fisted old pain.

97
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:54,850
All she ever did was sit around
that house day after day watching TV.

98
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:00,000
She kept that same old
cruddy furniture all her life.

99
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:05,170
What?

100
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,879
Oh, remember how she always
used to complain about the winters?

101
00:06:09,914 --> 00:06:10,980
Oh yeah.

102
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,508
Every year she was going to take
a trip to the South Pacific.

103
00:06:13,543 --> 00:06:15,040
It was her big dream.

104
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:17,260
But would she spend
the money? Nooooo.

105
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:19,542
She just sat around
whining all the time...

106
00:06:19,577 --> 00:06:21,990
...about how she'd like
to be in a warmer climate.

107
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:25,370
My guess is
she finally made it.

108
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,474
I think it would be terribly
bad to go through life...

109
00:06:34,509 --> 00:06:37,960
...having a secret dream
and never fulfilling it.

110
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:41,450
You'd never do anything silly
like that, would you Mr. Crane?

111
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:44,330
-What're you talking about?
-Oh, I don't know.

112
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:48,540
Perhaps a little something involving
a certain shoebox you keep hidden.

113
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:51,570
-Shoebox?
-Forget it, it's not important.

114
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:55,860
Oh fine, if you don't want to
talk about it, don't talk about it.

115
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,958
It's only something you've given
over thirty years of your life to.

116
00:06:58,993 --> 00:07:01,220
Hey, I didn't tell you that so you
can go around blabbing it to everyone.

117
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:04,160
-Tell us, dad, what's in the
shoe box? -Nothing, all right?

118
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:10,090
All right, all right.

119
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,860
It's just some songs I wrote...

120
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,600
-...for Frank Sinatra.
-And he keeps them in his shoebox.

121
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:20,580
I think your work here is done.

122
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:23,910
Dad?

123
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:28,680
Your mother and I used to
listen to Sinatra all the time.

124
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:31,750
I know most of
his songs by heart.

125
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:37,270
I guess I got it into my head one day
that I'd try to write a song myself.

126
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:40,850
I'd be at the station
house or on a stakeout...

127
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:45,880
...I'd get an idea and pretty
soon I had a shoebox full.

128
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:51,350
I used to imagine your mother and I
seeing Frank in the stands in Vegas...

129
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:54,320
...and he'd open the
show with one of my songs.

130
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:57,210
Oh gee, dad, why did you
never tell us about this?

131
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:00,630
-Because it is stupid. They
were no good... -Oh...

132
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:03,055
And don't bother to ask,
I'm not letting you see 'em.

133
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:06,270
Here they are. Just like
I told you, in his shoebox.

134
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:11,580
-They're quite good if you ask me.
-"You are the song my soul would sing."

135
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:16,200
-Very poetic. -"You make my
heart go ring-a ding-ding."

136
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:19,850
That was during Frank's
ring-a-ding period.

137
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:22,870
Lord, this shoebox
is full of them.

138
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:28,690
-"I didn't mean to hurt her, she made
me lose my mind". -Hey, lemme see that!

139
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:33,470
No, that's just some confession I took
from a guy. The lyrics are on the back.

140
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:38,910
Anyway, I never finished them.
They were never any good.

141
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,241
Well, except this. I gotta admit...

142
00:08:42,276 --> 00:08:44,900
...this has got "Frank Sinatra"
written all over it.

143
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,037
"She's such a groovy lady."

144
00:08:47,072 --> 00:08:51,000
It's still got that nice
contemporary sound.

145
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,900
So, why don't you send it
to old Blue Eyes?

146
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,987
No, they're just words
scribbled on a piece of paper.

147
00:08:57,022 --> 00:09:01,020
The tune's in my head, I don't
know how to write it down.

148
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:03,896
Well, Niles and I do. You've got
the tune in your head.

149
00:09:03,931 --> 00:09:05,875
Why don't you let us
write it down for you?

150
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:07,490
We can finish this dream tonight.

151
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:10,710
-It's just a dumb idea.
-Oh come on dad, really.

152
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:14,400
Oh, you're wasting your breath
trying to convince him to do something.

153
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:18,300
-Dad, come on.
-Come on now. Drop it.

154
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,775
Yeah, you're probably right.

155
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,800
You just sit there night
after night watching TV...

156
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,773
...until the time finally comes
when we collect your ashes...

157
00:09:25,808 --> 00:09:27,400
...and scatter them over that chair...

158
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:30,410
...where they'll probably go unnoticed.

159
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:37,870
-All right, okay.
-You mean it?

160
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:44,620
-OK, Niles.
-I get the piano.

161
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:47,690
Okay, so boys...

162
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,580
...the way I'm hearing the intro,
it goes something like this...

163
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,900
Of course, it is your piano.

164
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,630
No, no, it goes:

165
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,600
-So it's like... -No, no, come
on, this is the big finish.

166
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:35,773
Dad, dad, in Niles's defense,
after four hours your...

167
00:10:35,808 --> 00:10:38,030
...sound a lot like your...

168
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:43,220
-Right, Niles, let's just try
it again. -All right. Like this.

169
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:48,310
Yeah! That's it.

170
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,720
-Yeah. Let's hear the chorus
one last time. -OK!

171
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:13,510
Niles. Dad, I don't
mean to criticise.

172
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,601
You know that "heidi-hiedi?"

173
00:11:15,636 --> 00:11:18,900
It sounds like Cab Calloway
sung backwards.

174
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:23,310
-You got any better suggestions?
-Er, yes, yes:

175
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:29,030
No, no:

176
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:33,430
"She makes the bravest
cat go 'fraidy!"

177
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:44,000
I've got it: "She could have
slept with Warren Beatty!"

178
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:51,320
-Very nice Daphne, no. -Well,
I'm sticking with my one, keep singing.

179
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,950
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I don't mean to quibble...

180
00:12:07,985 --> 00:12:11,620
...but it seems like her heart
is always going heidi-hiedi...

181
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:14,420
...ringy-dingy,
or scooby dooby.

182
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:20,120
-Look, I don't need another critic.
-Fine, perhaps a cardiologist?

183
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:23,506
In all due respect...

184
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:26,530
...I think I'm a little more
tuned in to what Frank likes...

185
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:31,230
...and this is pretty close to
perfect the way it is. -Well?

186
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:34,997
How about that! Thirty years
and I've finally finished it.

187
00:12:35,032 --> 00:12:36,940
Congratulations, dad.

188
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:40,140
Thanks guys.

189
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:44,540
Yeah, first thing tomorrow,
I'm mailing it to Frank's people.

190
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,193
A little help from Lady Luck...

191
00:12:46,228 --> 00:12:50,550
...maybe they'll kick it upstairs
to the chairman himself.

192
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:09,250
Oh Jeez! The service
is in an hour.

193
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,433
Aren't you finished
with that eulogy yet?

194
00:13:11,468 --> 00:13:14,240
I can't even come up
with a first line.

195
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:20,150
I got this old photo album, probably
one of her pictures might inspire me.

196
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:22,050
How about this:

197
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:26,500
"We all loved Aunt Louise,
even if the camera didn't!"

198
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:33,230
Dr. Crane, you've been agonising
over this for two weeks.

199
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:35,743
Perhaps it's time to start
bending the truth a little.

200
00:13:35,778 --> 00:13:38,210
No, I refuse to lie.

201
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:41,191
I find it hard to
believe there isn't...

202
00:13:41,226 --> 00:13:43,630
...one nice story
you can tell about her.

203
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:45,582
Maybe a cute little saying she used?

204
00:13:45,617 --> 00:13:46,827
I'm not sure that, "Stop crying...

205
00:13:46,862 --> 00:13:50,380
...or I'll give you something to
cry about" would qualify.

206
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:55,540
-Where are you off to?
-Just going to go check the mail.

207
00:13:57,530 --> 00:14:00,530
I wish they'd just give him
an answer about that song.

208
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:04,950
He must have made a hundred trips to
the mailbox during the past two weeks.

209
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,740
Oh, bless you, Daphne. Are you sure
you're up to coming to the memorial?

210
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,860
Oh, it's just a little cold.

211
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:17,950
Besides, in my family, when there
was a funeral everybody went.

212
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:20,144
I remember when
Grammy Moon passed on.

213
00:14:20,179 --> 00:14:22,410
My brothers had been off
on a three-day bender.

214
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:25,003
They couldn't even stand on
their own - pissed as newts!

215
00:14:25,038 --> 00:14:28,240
But they crawled to that chapel
on their hands and knees.

216
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:32,490
Very commendable.

217
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:37,540
Yeah, well, they had an obligation.
They were the pallbearers.

218
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:40,923
Hello, Daphne.
-Hello.

219
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:43,840
Oh dear Lord, Niles, don't tell me you
haven't disposed of those ashes yet.

220
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,866
Frasier, I have taken them
to a dozen locations.

221
00:14:45,901 --> 00:14:48,600
Fossy glade, a babbling brook,
a moonlit pond.

222
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,500
None of them felt right,
what am I going to do?

223
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:55,770
Well, winter's coming. The
sidewalks are always slippery.

224
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:00,240
I'm having the same
problem with the eulogy!

225
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,740
Oh, remember when this
photo was taken?

226
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:05,900
the day Aunt Lousie took me to
Wilson's Meadow to fly a kite?

227
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:08,337
It cost her 35 cents and
when it got stuck in a tree...

228
00:15:08,372 --> 00:15:10,160
...she made me climb up after it.

229
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:13,290
I fell out, broke my
collarbone in two places.

230
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:17,070
I think that's the only
time I saw her laugh.

231
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:22,512
Frasier! I think she might
be happy there!

232
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:24,850
Niles, I think you might be right.

233
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:27,950
And even if she's not,
let's still do it.

234
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:32,470
-Any news about your song?
-Nah.

235
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,107
Listen, we better get started.

236
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:36,345
All right. Perhaps
I'll have some inspiration...

237
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:37,580
...on the way over in the car.

238
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:40,750
And Wilson's Meadow is on the way.
We can stop and scatter the ashes.

239
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:42,317
Well, this sounds like a family affair.

240
00:15:42,352 --> 00:15:44,950
-Maybe I'll take my car and meet
you there. -All right, let's go.

241
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:46,995
Wilson's Meadow is
the perfect place.

242
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:49,030
Aunt Louise, you've
tormented me for two weeks...

243
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:52,390
and finally I've shown you
I can do something right.

244
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:00,090
Oh, shut up!

245
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:14,370
Here, here, yes, yes. Perfect.

246
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:21,980
There's something rattling in here.
Like some great grisly morata.

247
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,960
What am I going to
say at this memorial?

248
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:38,640
-Don't ask me.
-You write lyrics, don't ya? -Right!

249
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:41,340
Tell that to Sinatra!

250
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:46,952
Oh, dad, it's a good song.

251
00:16:46,987 --> 00:16:49,990
I even caught myself singing it
in the shower this morning.

252
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:55,070
Just because you haven't heard
anything yet doesn't mean...

253
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:01,480
-...you have heard something?
-Yeah.

254
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:06,830
-This morning they rejected it.
-Oh, I'm sorry, dad.

255
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,490
Oh, it's okay. Sinatra must
get thousands of songs...

256
00:17:10,525 --> 00:17:12,800
...sent to him. What did I expect?

257
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:23,870
-Well, you know, at least you gave it
your best shot. -Yeah, I guess.

258
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:26,665
I mean, sure it would have been
nice to hear it sung...

259
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:29,950
...but hey, I finished it, finally!

260
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,734
Yeah, I walked down that highway...

261
00:17:32,769 --> 00:17:37,260
...and climbed that mountain,
and reached for the stars.

262
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:42,290
Oh sure, now I get hot!

263
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:49,270
-I can't open the damn urn!
-Oh, you are so helpless!

264
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:53,880
-For Pete's sake, give it to me,
give it to me. -I made it loose.

265
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:16,980
It looks like Louise's
whole rest home showed up.

266
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:20,470
It must be "Liver & Onions
Day" in the cafeteria.

267
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:22,659
Apparently when they heard
it was Frasier Crane...

268
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:25,750
... from the radio speaking,
the whole rest home turned out.

269
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:29,990
-Can't wait to hear what he
has to say. -Neither can he.

270
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:34,990
He's huddled in the rectory still
working on his first sentence.

271
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,821
How did the scattering go?
Were there any problems?

272
00:18:38,856 --> 00:18:41,000
No, nothing important.

273
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,800
Dear friends, thank you
all for coming today.

274
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:59,480
I know how very deeply your
friendship was treasured by Louise.

275
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:03,210
We are privileged to have
with us her favourite nephew...

276
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:07,890
...one of Seattle's most eloquent
speakers, Dr. Frasier Crane.

277
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,880
Dr. Crane has spent the
last fortnight reflecting...

278
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:14,730
...on what
Louise meant to him.

279
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:17,030
Dr. Crane?

280
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:23,590
Well, well, well.

281
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:27,650
What can I say about Aunt Louise?

282
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:31,090
What can
I say?

283
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,220
Louise...

284
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,100
...touched us all.

285
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,320
In fact...

286
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:53,020
...she touches us still.

287
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:02,990
Aunt Louise...

288
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:06,890
...loved to teach
us all lessons.

289
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:11,680
You know, it's hard to picture
her without hearing her saying,

290
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:14,910
"I'm going to teach
you a lesson."

291
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:22,570
What particularly comes to mind...

292
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:25,016
...by the very way
she lived her own life...

293
00:20:25,051 --> 00:20:29,110
...she taught us how important it is...

294
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,400
...to pursue our dreams.

295
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,700
Whether we succeed or fail...

296
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:39,090
...what really matters
is that we tried.

297
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:42,590
And now as we say
goodbye to Louise...

298
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:47,110
...a phrase comes to mind. It was
