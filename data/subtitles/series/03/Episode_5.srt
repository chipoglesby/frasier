1
00:00:10,597 --> 00:00:13,103
Faster, Frasier, faster!

2
00:00:13,103 --> 00:00:14,310
You can make this light!

3
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:16,251
God, you're going to get us killed!

4
00:00:16,251 --> 00:00:20,343
I can't be late for this date!

5
00:00:20,343 --> 00:00:22,004
Oh, this is ridiculous!

6
00:00:22,004 --> 00:00:23,734
First the drycleaner, then the ATM,

7
00:00:23,734 --> 00:00:25,955
now you're making me cart you off to some restaurant!

8
00:00:25,955 --> 00:00:28,699
Well, I'm sorry, I didn't plan for
my car to be in the shop.

9
00:00:28,699 --> 00:00:31,561
But I really, really appreciate it, Frasier.

10
00:00:31,561 --> 00:00:35,548
Oh, a basket of fruit would suffice!

11
00:00:35,548 --> 00:00:37,762
I am changing for my date!

12
00:00:37,762 --> 00:00:38,819
Don't look at me!  Turn around!

13
00:00:38,819 --> 00:00:40,110
Turn all the way around!

14
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:41,118
I'm driving!

15
00:00:41,118 --> 00:00:44,445
Fine!

16
00:00:44,445 --> 00:00:45,620
Hand me my jeans, will you?

17
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:48,510
Here.

18
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:51,996
Oh, oh, great! That's just what i need!

19
00:00:51,996 --> 00:00:53,759
There's a police car behind us.

20
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:54,969
Please don't turn on the red light.

21
00:00:54,969 --> 00:00:56,238
Don't turn on the red light.

22
00:00:56,238 --> 00:00:57,988
Don't turn on the

23
00:00:57,988 --> 00:01:01,989
Damn it, Frasier!

24
00:01:01,989 --> 00:01:04,415
Don't worry, you're not going to get a ticket.

25
00:01:04,415 --> 00:01:06,173
You're a celebrity, use a little juice!

26
00:01:06,173 --> 00:01:07,927
Oh, I refuse to do anything of the sort!

27
00:01:07,927 --> 00:01:14,923
OK, fine.  Enjoy traffic school.

28
00:01:14,923 --> 00:01:21,219
Good Evening, officer.
I'm Doctor Fraiser Crane
If there's any problem I'm listening.

29
00:01:21,219 --> 00:01:25,275
I clocked you doing sixty-two in a forty-mile zone.

30
00:01:25,275 --> 00:01:28,043
Well, this is interesting.

31
00:01:28,043 --> 00:01:30,011
Usually both people are in the backseat.

32
00:01:30,011 --> 00:01:33,112
It's not what you think.

33
00:01:33,112 --> 00:01:37,743
See, we were just coming back from KACL,
where I do my radio show.

34
00:01:37,743 --> 00:01:40,080
Uh-huh.

35
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,321
You see, we ran a little late,

36
00:01:42,321 --> 00:01:44,201
because I was on with a very troubled caller,

37
00:01:44,201 --> 00:01:50,766
with a very complex psychological problem...
on my radio show.

38
00:01:50,766 --> 00:01:51,937
Hey, wait a minute.

39
00:01:51,937 --> 00:01:54,313
You're Dr. Frasier Crane!

40
00:01:54,313 --> 00:01:57,547
Drat!  My cover is blown.

41
00:01:57,547 --> 00:01:58,697
I love your show!

44
00:02:01,074 --> 00:02:02,607
It's always nice to...

45
00:02:02,607 --> 00:02:06,262
License and registration, please.

46
00:02:06,262 --> 00:02:11,431
Be arrested by a fan.

47
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:13,783
Roz, if you could delay ablutions?

48
00:02:13,783 --> 00:02:16,658
I'm in custody here!

49
00:02:16,658 --> 00:02:19,825
Hey, it's your birthday today.

50
00:02:19,825 --> 00:02:22,351
Is this a little celebration?

51
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:27,402
No, no, I'm simply taking
my producer to meet her date.

52
00:02:27,402 --> 00:02:29,794
Frasier, why didn't you tell me
it was your birthday?

53
00:02:29,794 --> 00:02:32,062
I'd have thrown you a party at the station!

54
00:02:32,062 --> 00:02:35,808
Question asked, question answered.

55
00:02:35,808 --> 00:02:37,999
I'm just going to be dropping her off,

56
00:02:37,999 --> 00:02:43,295
then have a cold plate of deli,
and get to bed early.

57
00:02:43,295 --> 00:02:46,728
Almost makes you feel sorry for me, doesn't it?

58
00:02:46,728 --> 00:02:49,337
I spent my last birthday subduing
a drunk-and-disorderly

59
00:02:49,337 --> 00:02:51,311
at a sleazy bar.

60
00:02:51,311 --> 00:02:53,229
Don't you hate to work on your birthday?

61
00:02:53,229 --> 00:02:56,134
He was my date.

62
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:57,240
Tell you what I'm going to do.

63
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,383
I'm going to let you off.

64
00:02:58,383 --> 00:03:00,528
Just think of this as
a little birthday gift from me.

65
00:03:00,528 --> 00:03:01,535
Thank you.

66
00:03:01,535 --> 00:03:04,326
But slow down.

67
00:03:04,326 --> 00:03:06,943
I'd hate to see you get hurt.

68
00:03:06,943 --> 00:03:12,071
I'm listening.

69
00:03:12,071 --> 00:03:17,080
OK, let's go!

70
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:20,016
Do you sense a little moment there?

71
00:03:20,016 --> 00:03:21,408
What are you talking about?!

72
00:03:21,408 --> 00:03:24,052
Well, between me and that
very attractive officer.

73
00:03:24,052 --> 00:03:27,496
It just felt like there was something there.

74
00:03:27,496 --> 00:03:28,945
Yeah, major sparks.

75
00:03:28,945 --> 00:03:30,262
Now, just the right pedal.

76
00:03:30,262 --> 00:03:30,829
The big pedal?

77
00:03:30,829 --> 00:03:32,495
Now, just a minute.

78
00:03:32,495 --> 00:03:33,581
We'll see if she's watching me.

79
00:03:33,581 --> 00:03:35,864
If she's watching me, she's interested.

80
00:03:35,864 --> 00:03:39,529
Oh, yes!  She's turning around, she's looking up!

81
00:03:39,529 --> 00:03:45,517
Move your vehicle!

82
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:53,711
Oh, yes.  I've cast my spell.<SYNC Start=230580

83
00:03:53,711 --> 00:03:55,748
Go on, Dr. Crane, make a wish.

84
00:03:55,748 --> 00:03:57,159
Oh, why bother?

85
00:03:57,159 --> 00:04:04,800
I made the same wish last year,
it didn't come true.

86
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,214
Come on, son, blow out the candles!

87
00:04:13,789 --> 00:04:15,550
Oh, what a surprise.

88
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:17,878
Look, they're lighting again!

89
00:04:17,878 --> 00:04:22,638
What sorcerer's magic is this?

90
00:04:22,638 --> 00:04:25,887
You know, Dad, I had a nice
little birthday bonus today.

91
00:04:25,887 --> 00:04:29,286
On my way home, I was pulled over
for speeding by a very pretty

92
00:04:29,286 --> 00:04:32,384
policewoman, who let me off.

93
00:04:32,384 --> 00:04:34,828
I got the distinct impression
that she found me attractive.

94
00:04:34,828 --> 00:04:36,119
Now, that sort of thing happens, doesn't it?

95
00:04:36,119 --> 00:04:36,886
Oh, sure.

96
00:04:36,886 --> 00:04:39,571
I was always leaning against
somebody's window thinking,

97
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:42,548
"that bloody chainsaw in the
backseat looks kind of iffy,

98
00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:45,899
but she's got a cute smile!"

99
00:04:45,899 --> 00:04:47,719
Oh, ha, ha.

100
00:04:47,719 --> 00:04:49,677
I'm telling you, there was something there, though.

101
00:04:49,677 --> 00:04:52,405
Well, of course the whole conversation's academic.

102
00:04:52,405 --> 00:04:54,061
I don't even know her name.

103
00:04:54,061 --> 00:04:56,375
I suppose I could call down to the police station

104
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:58,924
and try to find out who was on traffic duty.

105
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:03,467
But, uh, I don't suppose they'd give
that sort of information to a civilian.

106
00:05:03,467 --> 00:05:04,756
You'd have to have some...

107
00:05:04,756 --> 00:05:09,871
conduit to the police department,
an insider who could break

108
00:05:09,871 --> 00:05:13,594
that damnable code of silence!

109
00:05:13,594 --> 00:05:16,478
All right, I'll make the damn call.

110
00:05:16,478 --> 00:05:17,582
You, Dad?

111
00:05:17,582 --> 00:05:18,454
Why, I didn't even think of?

112
00:05:18,454 --> 00:05:22,045
Oh, shut up.

113
00:05:22,045 --> 00:05:24,423
You know, I haven't felt such
an instant attraction

114
00:05:24,423 --> 00:05:26,614
to a woman in quite some time.

115
00:05:26,614 --> 00:05:28,733
Well, considering the difference
in our backgrounds,

116
00:05:28,733 --> 00:05:30,188
it's really rather puzzling.

117
00:05:30,188 --> 00:05:34,653
Oh, pish-tosh!

118
00:05:34,653 --> 00:05:36,467
It's painfully obvious what's attracting you

119
00:05:36,467 --> 00:05:40,893
the gleam of her jackboots,
her dangling nightstick,

120
00:05:40,893 --> 00:05:44,909
the glint of her handcuffs hanging
on her leather belt.

121
00:05:44,909 --> 00:05:50,661
You're off on some lurid little disciplinary fantasy.

122
00:05:50,661 --> 00:05:53,069
Oh, Dr. Crane, shame on you!

123
00:05:53,069 --> 00:05:55,428
You got icing up and down your sleeve!

124
00:05:55,428 --> 00:06:00,829
Oh.  I am a naughty boy.

125
00:06:00,829 --> 00:06:02,924
Well, certainly a messy one.

126
00:06:02,924 --> 00:06:06,251
But mainly a naughty one.

127
00:06:06,251 --> 00:06:09,065
Hey, Charlie, yeah, Marty Crane, how ya doing?

128
00:06:09,065 --> 00:06:12,171
Hey, listen, Charlie, I'm trying to track down a woman

129
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:16,028
officer who was on traffic tonight, uh, near...

130
00:06:16,028 --> 00:06:16,786
Blanchett and Fourth.

131
00:06:16,786 --> 00:06:18,387
Blanchett and Fourth.

132
00:06:18,387 --> 00:06:21,251
Great, OK, thanks.

133
00:06:21,251 --> 00:06:22,444
Her name's Maureen Cutler,

134
00:06:22,444 --> 00:06:24,683
and she usually goes to McGinty's after work.

135
00:06:24,683 --> 00:06:26,380
Charlie said she's probably there now.

136
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,123
Thanks, Dad.

137
00:06:28,123 --> 00:06:29,000
Are you going to go?

138
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,732
Well, I don't know.

139
00:06:30,732 --> 00:06:31,205
A police bar?

140
00:06:31,205 --> 00:06:33,843
If I go in there alone, I'll stand
out like a sore thumb!

141
00:06:33,843 --> 00:06:37,081
All right, I'll go.

142
00:06:37,081 --> 00:06:41,204
Sit down, Niles, I'll go with him.

143
00:06:41,204 --> 00:06:44,572
You know, after all these hoity-toity,
caviar-sucking egghead types

144
00:06:44,572 --> 00:06:46,786
you've been dating, I think a lady cop

145
00:06:46,786 --> 00:06:49,200
would be a nice breath of fresh air.

146
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,313
Oh, all right, I'll go!

147
00:06:51,313 --> 00:06:53,978
Give me a second, I'll put some fresh collar-stays in,

148
00:06:53,978 --> 00:06:56,938
and-oh, oh, I've got a fabulous brand-new cashmere jacket

149
00:06:56,938 --> 00:07:00,827
I've been dying to premiere!

150
00:07:00,827 --> 00:07:03,837
Oh, yeah.  This is gonna work.

151
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:13,157
You see her yet?

152
00:07:13,157 --> 00:07:15,994
I don't know.

153
00:07:15,994 --> 00:07:17,625
What about her?

154
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:18,860
No, that's not Maureen.

155
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:24,091
No, I mean, what about her?

156
00:07:24,091 --> 00:07:26,144
Oh, there she is!

157
00:07:26,144 --> 00:07:32,225
Wow, she is a looker!
Well, come on, let's go say hello.

158
00:07:32,225 --> 00:07:37,779
Oh well!  Oh my God, fancy seeing you here!

159
00:07:37,779 --> 00:07:38,994
Hey, Frasier Crane.

160
00:07:38,994 --> 00:07:40,543
Oh, you remember me?

161
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:43,170
Come on ?sixty-two in a forty-mile zone
with a half-naked

162
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:47,017
girl in the backseat?

163
00:07:47,017 --> 00:07:47,611
Roz.

164
00:07:47,611 --> 00:07:49,794
Oh.

165
00:07:49,794 --> 00:07:52,136
Oh, uh, this is my father.

166
00:07:52,136 --> 00:07:53,936
How do you do?  I'm Maureen Cutler.

167
00:07:53,936 --> 00:07:55,403
Marty Crane, nice to meet you.

168
00:07:55,403 --> 00:07:56,946
Nice to meet you.

169
00:07:56,946 --> 00:07:58,800
Say, Maureen, how about a drink?

170
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,688
Yeah, why not?

171
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:00,909
Let me get them.

172
00:08:00,909 --> 00:08:02,617
I'm a beer drinker myself, what about you?

173
00:08:02,617 --> 00:08:03,673
That's fine by me.

174
00:08:03,673 --> 00:08:04,841
Beer, huh?

175
00:08:04,841 --> 00:08:09,910
Oh, what the hell, I'll try one.

176
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:13,353
So, what brings you guys here?
This is mostly a cop hangout.

177
00:08:13,353 --> 00:08:14,471
Well, I used to be on the force.

178
00:08:14,471 --> 00:08:14,891
Really?

179
00:08:14,891 --> 00:08:15,969
Yeah.

180
00:08:15,969 --> 00:08:17,240
Wait a minute.

181
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:20,997
Marty Crane?  You're Martin Crane!

182
00:08:20,997 --> 00:08:24,737
You're wasting your time in traffic,
you're quite a detective.

183
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:27,638
No, I mean I remember you when I was training.

184
00:08:27,638 --> 00:08:29,642
You gave this great lecture at the academy on

185
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:31,030
how to deal with an armed suspect.

186
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:32,457
Well, thanks.

187
00:08:32,457 --> 00:08:34,272
How come you left the force?

188
00:08:34,272 --> 00:08:39,903
Well, I uh, got shot by an armed suspect.

189
00:08:39,903 --> 00:08:40,481
I'm sorry.

190
00:08:40,481 --> 00:08:42,175
Oh, it's all right.

191
00:08:42,175 --> 00:08:44,617
So, do you miss it?

192
00:08:44,617 --> 00:08:51,838
Nah, how attached can you get to a hip?

193
00:08:51,838 --> 00:08:53,823
Oh.  Oh, I'm sorry.

194
00:08:53,823 --> 00:08:56,247
I have to get over to the hospital.

195
00:08:56,247 --> 00:08:58,977
I told them to beep me if
there was any news about my sergeant.

196
00:08:58,977 --> 00:09:00,255
What happened to him?

197
00:09:00,255 --> 00:09:01,842
She's having a baby.

198
00:09:01,842 --> 00:09:05,343
Oh well, hope it's a girl!

199
00:09:05,343 --> 00:09:06,664
Yeah, I'll tell Frasier you had to run.

200
00:09:06,664 --> 00:09:10,631
Thanks... listen, um, I never do this,

201
00:09:10,631 --> 00:09:17,217
but I would love to have a beer
or go to dinner sometime.

202
00:09:17,217 --> 00:09:18,352
With me?

203
00:09:18,352 --> 00:09:19,631
I don't want to put you on the spot.

204
00:09:19,631 --> 00:09:25,062
If you, uh, if you want to go out,
just give me a call.

205
00:09:25,062 --> 00:09:29,117
With me?

206
00:09:29,117 --> 00:09:30,708
You're the only one here.

207
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:32,657
Here we are!  Three beers.

208
00:09:32,657 --> 00:09:36,886
Good news, there was a fly in one glass,
so these are free!

209
00:09:36,886 --> 00:09:38,231
I'm sorry, I just got beeped.

210
00:09:38,231 --> 00:09:39,903
Oh, that's too bad.

211
00:09:39,903 --> 00:09:42,326
Yeah, but it was nice to see you.

212
00:09:42,326 --> 00:09:44,158
Maybe I'll bump into you again here sometime.

213
00:09:44,158 --> 00:09:44,880
Oh, that'd be great.

214
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:56,375
OK, bye.

215
00:09:58,646 --> 00:10:02,031
I'll have a grande half-caf latte,
with a whisper of cinnamon.

216
00:10:02,031 --> 00:10:05,951
And for my father, plain coffee.

217
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:09,990
I cannot emphasize the word "plain" enough.

218
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:12,551
No foam, no cinnamon, no exotic flavors.

219
00:10:12,551 --> 00:10:16,967
If it is not plain, I take no
responsibility for the consequences.

220
00:10:16,967 --> 00:10:19,135
How about a biscotti?

221
00:10:19,135 --> 00:10:19,775
All right.

222
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:26,383
But when you bring it, call it a cookie.

223
00:10:26,383 --> 00:10:27,140
Hi, son.

224
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,221
Hello, Dad.

225
00:10:28,221 --> 00:10:30,404
Uh, I want to thank you for meeting me like this.

226
00:10:30,404 --> 00:10:33,646
Well, my pleasure.

227
00:10:33,646 --> 00:10:38,732
So... what can I do you for?

228
00:10:38,732 --> 00:10:44,399
Well, I need some advice.

229
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:45,442
That's why you asked me here?

230
00:10:45,442 --> 00:10:46,989
Yeah.

231
00:10:46,989 --> 00:10:48,960
You've never done this before!

232
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,064
Yeah, well, I'm sorry.

233
00:10:50,064 --> 00:10:51,130
But anyway, you remember?

234
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:52,687
Dad, I want you to know
I'm not only deeply touched,

235
00:10:52,687 --> 00:10:55,775
but I consider this a watershed
moment in our relationship!

236
00:10:55,775 --> 00:10:56,857
Great.  See, the thing is?

237
00:10:56,857 --> 00:10:58,880
All my life, it seems you've always turned to Frasier.

238
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,084
"Frasier, Frasier, Frasier!"

239
00:11:00,084 --> 00:11:02,166
Niles, can I talk?!

240
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:05,209
I'm listening.

241
00:11:05,209 --> 00:11:13,737
Here we are.  One latte, one coffee, and one "cookie."

242
00:11:13,737 --> 00:11:18,429
I think they call this thing a biscotti.

243
00:11:18,429 --> 00:11:25,475
No need to talk down to the man.  Off you go!

244
00:11:25,475 --> 00:11:29,803
Well, anyway, uh, you remember
the other night, Frasier's policewoman?

245
00:11:29,803 --> 00:11:31,125
Mmm-hmm.

246
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:32,279
Well, we found her at the bar,

247
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:38,048
and, uh, well, she came on to me.

248
00:11:38,048 --> 00:11:38,649
No.

249
00:11:38,649 --> 00:11:39,506
Yeah.

250
00:11:39,506 --> 00:11:40,142
You?

251
00:11:40,142 --> 00:11:42,191
Yeah.

252
00:11:42,191 --> 00:11:45,413
Was she drunk?

253
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:48,061
Oh, I'm sorry, Dad, of course,
you're right, I'm sorry.

254
00:11:48,061 --> 00:11:51,636
Uh, what was Frasier's reaction?

255
00:11:51,636 --> 00:11:52,937
I haven't told him yet.

256
00:11:52,937 --> 00:11:54,370
Why not?

257
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:55,304
I just can't.

258
00:11:55,304 --> 00:11:59,026
Can I?

259
00:11:59,026 --> 00:12:01,040
I know he's going to feel lousy.

260
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:05,131
He finally meets a girl he likes,
and she's attracted to his old man.

261
00:12:05,131 --> 00:12:08,659
Hmm, that is quite a conundrum.

262
00:12:08,659 --> 00:12:10,954
I wonder if that's what's really bothering you.

263
00:12:10,954 --> 00:12:13,461
What do you mean?

264
00:12:13,461 --> 00:12:16,175
Maybe, underneath it all,
you're attracted to this woman and

265
00:12:16,175 --> 00:12:16,985
you want to go out with her.

266
00:12:16,985 --> 00:12:17,807
Oh, are you, nuts?

267
00:12:17,807 --> 00:12:20,883
That's sick!  That's disgusting!

268
00:12:20,883 --> 00:12:22,026
"it's just a theory."

269
00:12:22,026 --> 00:12:26,485
But for the sake of argument,
let's say you're right.

270
00:12:26,485 --> 00:12:29,182
Dad, you're allowed to be attracted to a woman.

271
00:12:29,182 --> 00:12:31,743
What kind of a father does a thing like that?

272
00:12:31,743 --> 00:12:34,576
Did you encourage her in any way?

273
00:12:34,576 --> 00:12:36,854
Well, I guess I was kind of charming.

274
00:12:36,854 --> 00:12:38,241
I mean, I didn't mean to be!

275
00:12:38,241 --> 00:12:41,905
It just sometimes leaks out.

276
00:12:41,905 --> 00:12:45,359
Well, what do you want to do?

277
00:12:45,359 --> 00:12:47,750
Well, most important I don't want to hurt Frasier.

278
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:52,049
And secondly, I want to go out with Maureen.

279
00:12:52,049 --> 00:12:56,794
The order of that changes
depending on the time of day.

280
00:12:56,794 --> 00:12:59,710
Well, one possibility is, go on a date with her.

281
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:01,632
If you feel there are sparks
between you and this woman,

282
00:13:01,632 --> 00:13:03,985
then tell Frasier.

283
00:13:03,985 --> 00:13:05,349
I don't want to lie to my son.

284
00:13:05,349 --> 00:13:06,204
You're not lying to him.

285
00:13:06,204 --> 00:13:07,945
You're delaying the truth to spare his feelings.

286
00:13:07,945 --> 00:13:11,459
If nothing happens, he need never know.

287
00:13:11,459 --> 00:13:13,422
Well, I guess it's worth a try.

288
00:13:13,422 --> 00:13:18,345
If Maureen and I hit it off,
then I'll tell him immediately.

289
00:13:18,345 --> 00:13:20,906
Or I can.  Really, I don't mind!

290
00:13:33,626 --> 00:13:35,120
Hi, Dad.

291
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,381
Oh, Frasier!  You're still home.

292
00:13:37,381 --> 00:13:40,382
Yeah.  Where are you going?

293
00:13:40,382 --> 00:13:44,496
Just out.

294
00:13:44,496 --> 00:13:46,370
What are you gonna do?

295
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:48,932
Nothing.

296
00:13:48,932 --> 00:13:52,056
When are you gonna be home?

297
00:13:52,056 --> 00:13:54,814
Later.

298
00:13:54,814 --> 00:13:56,543
Well, you put a dent in the car, young man,

299
00:13:56,543 --> 00:14:09,591
it's coming out of your allowance!

300
00:14:09,591 --> 00:14:10,962
I mean, I've got my pride, you know.

301
00:14:10,962 --> 00:14:13,780
So, I said to her, I said,
"Mrs. Crease, I'll do the cooking,

302
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:18,496
I'll do the cleaning, but
I draw the line at creaming your feet!"

303
00:14:18,496 --> 00:14:21,523
Dear, hurry up!  "The Mambo Kings" is about to start!

304
00:14:21,523 --> 00:14:25,797
Oh, I wouldn't mind mamboing
with Antonio Banderas!

305
00:14:25,797 --> 00:14:28,799
All right, set out the goodies
and I'll go get the wine.

306
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:31,911
Oh, and this time, Charlotte,
be careful with that chocolate!

307
00:14:31,911 --> 00:14:34,310
I had a hell of a time hiding the stain from His Nibs

308
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:38,081
Oh, hello, Dr. Crane!

309
00:14:38,081 --> 00:14:40,253
Daphne.  Charlotte, Maggie.

310
00:14:40,253 --> 00:14:41,073
Dr. Crane.

311
00:14:41,073 --> 00:14:42,137
Please, sit down.

312
00:14:42,137 --> 00:14:44,305
I thought you were filling
in at the station tonight.

313
00:14:44,305 --> 00:14:53,282
Oh, I am.  But, uh, not for a couple of hours yet.

314
00:14:53,282 --> 00:14:57,254
Oh-ho, seems a shame to hang around here.

315
00:14:57,254 --> 00:15:01,652
I mean, I would have thought
you'd have taken an opportunity like this to,

316
00:15:01,652 --> 00:15:05,563
I don't know... go down to McGinty's?

317
00:15:05,563 --> 00:15:07,926
Oh, to see his new lady friend, you mean?

318
00:15:07,926 --> 00:15:13,132
Ah, well, I see I've been quite
the hot topic over the teapot.

319
00:15:13,132 --> 00:15:16,057
You know, I may have said
a thing or two in passing, but?

320
00:15:16,057 --> 00:15:17,797
I'd go for it, Dr. Crane!

321
00:15:17,797 --> 00:15:20,933
Yes, well, if you must know,
I was planning to go down there,

322
00:15:20,933 --> 00:15:22,584
but not for a couple of days yet.

323
00:15:22,584 --> 00:15:24,105
Well, I wouldn't wait too long.

324
00:15:24,105 --> 00:15:27,057
I mean, strike while the iron's hot,
that's what I always say!

325
00:15:27,057 --> 00:15:28,922
She's right.

326
00:15:28,922 --> 00:15:30,870
Well, women don't really like men
that are too overeager.

327
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:32,230
Oh, nonsense.

328
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:34,958
I mean, you know, it's one thing
if the man's some bounder

329
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:39,281
git from the docks, but it's different
if the man's like you.

330
00:15:39,281 --> 00:15:40,669
Someone who's charming.

331
00:15:40,669 --> 00:15:41,877
And handsome.

332
00:15:41,877 --> 00:15:58,313
And knows lots and lots of words.

333
00:15:58,313 --> 00:16:02,438
Well, McGinty's is on my way to the station.

334
00:16:02,438 --> 00:16:05,987
I suppose I could just pop my head in.

335
00:16:05,987 --> 00:16:07,469
Thank you, ladies, for your support ?

336
00:16:07,469 --> 00:16:12,292
even if it was nakedly self-serving and insincere.

337
00:16:16,239 --> 00:16:17,905
So, they finally put my transfer through,

338
00:16:17,905 --> 00:16:21,282
and I'm moving out of Traffic and into Narcotics.

339
00:16:21,282 --> 00:16:23,914
Yeah, I'm gonna be working with,
uh, Bill Henderson at the 31st.

340
00:16:23,914 --> 00:16:25,898
Good for you.

341
00:16:25,898 --> 00:16:28,589
Yeah, I'm excited, although
I hear he can be pretty tough.

342
00:16:28,589 --> 00:16:32,434
Oh no.  I mean, he might seem
a little stiff and strait-laced,

343
00:16:32,434 --> 00:16:35,002
but once you get to know him he's
the greatest guy in the world.

344
00:16:35,002 --> 00:16:36,482
Yeah, he is pretty impressive.

345
00:16:36,482 --> 00:16:39,642
Oh yeah, smart, great sense of humor.

346
00:16:39,642 --> 00:16:42,155
No, you're gonna have a great time.

347
00:16:42,155 --> 00:16:44,899
Dad, I can't believe you're doing this!

348
00:16:44,899 --> 00:16:45,829
Frasier!

349
00:16:45,829 --> 00:16:47,728
Look, I was gonna tell you?

350
00:16:47,728 --> 00:16:50,079
Believe me, I did not put him up to this,

351
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:53,249
though I think he's overselling me a little.

352
00:16:53,249 --> 00:16:54,990
I'm not the greatest guy in the world.

353
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:57,573
Seattle, maybe.

354
00:16:57,573 --> 00:16:58,686
Am I missing something?

355
00:16:58,686 --> 00:16:59,643
Oh, I'm just joking.

356
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:01,733
OK, Dad, thanks for warming her up for me.

357
00:17:01,733 --> 00:17:03,449
I can take over here.

358
00:17:03,449 --> 00:17:11,425
Martin?

359
00:17:11,425 --> 00:17:33,578
Frasier... Maureen and I are here on a date.

360
00:17:33,578 --> 00:17:35,204
I know you might think this is one of those wildly

361
00:17:35,204 --> 00:17:39,844
embarrassing moments where
I'm standing here with egg on my face.

362
00:17:39,844 --> 00:17:43,060
I assure you, I'm not as embarrassed
as you might assume

363
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:45,326
I would be embarrassed.

364
00:17:45,326 --> 00:17:52,961
I'm not uncomfortable, so please,
don't you be uncomfortable either.

365
00:17:52,961 --> 00:17:54,713
Why don't I give you two a moment?

366
00:17:54,713 --> 00:17:58,576
Whatever!

367
00:17:58,576 --> 00:17:59,517
You asked her out?!

368
00:17:59,517 --> 00:18:01,767
No, that's not the way it happened.

369
00:18:01,767 --> 00:18:02,968
There's no use lying to me.

370
00:18:02,968 --> 00:18:04,721
I am at the lowest point I could possibly be,

371
00:18:04,721 --> 00:18:06,762
so please just tell me the truth!

372
00:18:06,762 --> 00:18:08,571
Maureen asked me out.

373
00:18:08,571 --> 00:18:14,470
Going down!

374
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:17,086
It happened the other night
when you went to the bar to get drinks.

375
00:18:17,086 --> 00:18:20,538
You know, it just caught me off guard,
I didn't know how to handle it.

376
00:18:20,538 --> 00:18:22,408
So, Niles said I should?

377
00:18:22,408 --> 00:18:24,271
Niles?  Niles knows?

378
00:18:24,271 --> 00:18:26,359
Look, I'm sorry.

379
00:18:26,359 --> 00:18:27,669
It was supposed to be a one-time thing,

380
00:18:27,669 --> 00:18:29,564
just to see if there was something there,

381
00:18:29,564 --> 00:18:33,502
and if there wasn't, then you
didn't even need to know about it.

382
00:18:33,502 --> 00:18:36,281
Well, is there?  "Something there?"

383
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:39,158
Oh, yeah.

384
00:18:39,158 --> 00:18:43,586
Well... it's not as if we were standing
side-by-side when she chose you.

385
00:18:43,586 --> 00:18:44,931
I was at the bar!

386
00:18:44,931 --> 00:18:48,380
If you'd gone to get the drinks,
things would have been different.

387
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:50,242
I don't think so.

388
00:18:50,242 --> 00:18:51,503
Dad, I'm drowning here.

389
00:18:51,503 --> 00:18:54,033
Please, throw me a line!

390
00:18:54,033 --> 00:18:56,384
Look, uh, I'm gonna go tell her
this whole thing is a mistake?

391
00:18:56,384 --> 00:18:59,952
No, no, no, Dad!

392
00:18:59,952 --> 00:19:04,158
I'll be OK, really.

393
00:19:04,158 --> 00:19:08,614
Well... the old dog's  still got it in him, huh?

394
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:11,099
Yeah.  But, really, how long can it last?

395
00:19:11,099 --> 00:19:14,051
I mean, she's got to come to her senses eventually?

396
00:19:14,051 --> 00:19:16,950
Oh no, Dad, Dad, don't sell yourself short.

397
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:19,753
You've got a lot to offer.

398
00:19:19,753 --> 00:19:24,540
Well, I'd better head off to work.

399
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,419
Goodnight, Dad.

400
00:19:25,419 --> 00:19:30,941
Goodnight, thanks.

401
00:19:30,941 --> 00:19:33,233
Damn!

402
00:19:38,503 --> 00:19:40,594
Uh-uh, OK, thanks.

403
00:19:40,594 --> 00:19:43,824
Frasier just came in the building,
so everybody hide and be quiet.

404
00:19:43,824 --> 00:19:45,771
Do you think he'll be surprised?

405
00:19:45,771 --> 00:19:47,435
Considering his birthday was yesterday?

406
00:19:47,435 --> 00:19:49,921
Yeah, I do, Elizabeth.

407
00:19:49,921 --> 00:19:52,988
Should we yell "surprise" or "happy birthday?"

408
00:19:52,988 --> 00:19:55,377
We've done this like five hundred times.

409
00:19:55,377 --> 00:19:57,214
And every time it's pretty much the same.

410
00:19:57,214 --> 00:19:59,008
We yell, the person pretends to be surprised,

411
00:19:59,008 --> 00:20:01,248
and we stuff ourselves with cake.

412
00:20:01,248 --> 00:20:03,184
I just wanted it to be perfect.

413
00:20:03,184 --> 00:20:08,211
And that is what makes you so special to us.

414
00:20:08,211 --> 00:20:16,287
Now get under the console!

415
00:20:16,287 --> 00:20:17,287
Hi, Frasier!

416
00:20:17,287 --> 00:20:18,698
How you doing?

417
00:20:18,698 --> 00:20:20,384
Oh, just wonderful.

418
00:20:20,384 --> 00:20:23,920
Forty-three is off to a rousing start.

419
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,584
Remember that policewoman I was interested in?

420
00:20:25,584 --> 00:20:26,304
Yeah?

421
00:20:26,304 --> 00:20:30,318
Well, she's dating my father!

422
00:20:30,318 --> 00:20:31,087
Your father?

423
00:20:31,087 --> 00:20:31,910
Mmm-hmm!

424
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:33,013
Well, never mind that.

425
00:20:33,013 --> 00:20:35,045
I know just what will take your mind off of it.

426
00:20:35,045 --> 00:20:36,632
I've got something really funny in my booth.

427
00:20:36,632 --> 00:20:39,152
I spent the last hour wandering
the streets, trying to take

428
00:20:39,152 --> 00:20:40,937
assessment of my life.

429
00:20:40,937 --> 00:20:41,882
Do you know how long it's been since

430
00:20:41,882 --> 00:20:43,824
I've slept with a woman?  Seven months!

431
00:20:43,824 --> 00:20:44,486
Frasier?

432
00:20:44,486 --> 00:20:48,392
All right, nine months!

433
00:20:48,392 --> 00:20:50,421
I really don't think we should
talk about that right now!

434
00:20:50,421 --> 00:20:53,799
Oh sure, fine, you can't spare me
five minutes to talk about

435
00:20:53,799 --> 00:20:56,645
my problems, when every day I drop
what I'm doing to be your

436
00:20:56,645 --> 00:20:57,711
personal Wailing Wall.

437
00:20:57,711 --> 00:20:59,032
"Frasier, he stopped calling me."

438
00:20:59,032 --> 00:21:00,522
"Frasier, he wants his key back."

439
00:21:00,522 --> 00:21:05,133
"Frasier, his girlfriend is having me followed!"

440
00:21:05,133 --> 00:21:09,024
I'm sorry.

441
00:21:09,024 --> 00:21:11,835
So nine months, huh?

442
00:21:11,835 --> 00:21:14,745
Nine long, long, months.

443
00:21:14,745 --> 00:21:15,590
Oh...

444
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:16,535
You know who that woman was?

445
00:21:16,535 --> 00:21:17,252
Who?

446
00:21:17,252 --> 00:21:18,208
Edna, from Accounting.

447
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:20,887
No...

448
00:21:20,887 --> 00:21:23,271
The next day, she dumped me!

449
00:21:23,271 --> 00:21:25,153
I tell you, Roz, I'm starting to
feel nostalgic for that summer

450
00:21:25,153 --> 00:21:30,475
in my twenties when I was impotent!

451
00:21:30,475 --> 00:21:31,782
The only comfort I have now is knowing that

452
00:21:31,782 --> 00:21:34,083
my humiliation can't possibly get any worse!

453
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:43,220
SURPRISE!

454
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:51,036
Hi, Edna.
