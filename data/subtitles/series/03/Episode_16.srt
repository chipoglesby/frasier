00:00:09,765 --> 00:00:12,718
This is Dr. Frasier Crane, KACL, 780.

3
00:00:13,643 --> 00:00:18,055
Frasier, that was security.  
Some woman insisted on seeing you, 
she just blew right past them.

4
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:21,929
Oh, don't panic, Roz — probably just 
one of my more ardent fans.

5
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,904
Niles, we've got to talk!  It's urgent.

6
00:00:34,075 --> 00:00:36,696
Frasier, I'm with a patient!

7
00:00:36,869 --> 00:00:39,441
- Is, uh, this about a woman? 
- Yes.

8
00:00:39,621 --> 00:00:42,325
Take all the time you need.

9
00:00:44,499 --> 00:00:46,990
- Well?
- She's back...

10
00:00:47,168 --> 00:00:49,872
the scourge of my existence.

11
00:00:51,004 --> 00:00:54,170
Strange, I usually get some sign 
when Lilith is in town —

12
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:58,716
dogs forming into packs, 
blood weeping down the wall.

13
00:00:59,886 --> 00:01:02,922
I'm talking about... 

14
00:01:03,097 --> 00:01:05,053
Diane Chambers.

15
00:01:05,223 --> 00:01:07,714
Lucille, send Mr. Carr home.

16
00:01:11,061 --> 00:01:13,433
She just showed up at the station today.

17
00:01:13,605 --> 00:01:17,222
Apparently some play she wrote 
is being produced here in town.

18
00:01:17,399 --> 00:01:20,399
I admit, I just sort of panicked 
when I saw her,

19
00:01:20,568 --> 00:01:22,774
but I think I covered it masterfully.

20
00:01:22,945 --> 00:01:25,945
All right, all right, all right.  
Well, uh, why do you think you reacted 
that way?

21
00:01:26,114 --> 00:01:30,360
Oh, spare me the psychiatrist bit, Niles.  
That includes putting down the pad!

22
00:01:33,244 --> 00:01:35,283
In the drawer, Niles!

23
00:01:37,122 --> 00:01:41,748
Fine. My first question to you is this: 
Are you still in love with her?

24
00:01:41,917 --> 00:01:44,871
No! Not in the least! 
It's a ridiculous suggestion.

25
00:01:45,045 --> 00:01:49,504
Seeing as how I have nowhere 
to write the phrase, "classic denial," 
I'll move on.

26
00:01:53,593 --> 00:01:57,091
So, about this woman 
for whom you have so little feeling 

27
00:01:57,262 --> 00:02:01,129
that you raced across town and burst 
into one of my sessions — is there 
any lingering resentment?

28
00:02:01,307 --> 00:02:03,346
Over what?!

29
00:02:06,769 --> 00:02:08,808
Well, she did leave at the altar.

30
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:11,896
When you told her how that made you feel, 
was there anything you left unsaid?

31
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:17,900
Any phrase or feeling 
you wished you had expressed to her?

32
00:02:20,905 --> 00:02:23,775
I'm making the assumption here 
that you did tell her how you felt.

33
00:02:25,283 --> 00:02:27,110
I sort of did.

34
00:02:28,327 --> 00:02:32,027
"Sort of" is another one of those phrases 
that just wants to go in my pad.

35
00:02:36,542 --> 00:02:38,664
I expressed my distaste for the way 
I'd been treated, yes.

36
00:02:38,835 --> 00:02:42,334
Frasier, she rejected you 
in the most debilitating way 
a man can be rejected.

37
00:02:42,505 --> 00:02:44,995
You've got to more than 
"sort of" tell her how that felt.

38
00:02:45,173 --> 00:02:50,511
Well, I can't just tell Diane 
how awful she made me feel now! 
It's a distant memory for her.  
I'd feel weak!

39
00:02:50,677 --> 00:02:52,800
You have no reason to feel weak.

40
00:02:52,971 --> 00:02:56,588
You've moved on in your life too.
You have a new career, new wealth, new success.

41
00:02:56,765 --> 00:02:59,849
You simply need closure in this one area.

44
00:03:06,523 --> 00:03:09,642
I tuned you out after that.

45
00:03:09,817 --> 00:03:16,019
I'm going to invite Diane over for dinner tonight, 
and I'm really gonna flaunt my success, 
really rub her nose in it!  

46
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:20,063
That'll prove I'm not just some cast-aside 
that never got over her.  

47
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:24,278
Niles, I know it's not psychologically sound.

48
00:03:24,453 --> 00:03:26,528
But we're still human.

49
00:03:26,704 --> 00:03:29,621
We have to do 
what feels good sometimes, don't we?

50
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:33,573
I'd just like to be on the record 
as saying I'm against it.

51
00:03:33,751 --> 00:03:37,166
- Fine.
- You know the path that leads 
to peace with Diane and you're rejecting it.

52
00:03:37,337 --> 00:03:39,460
- Yes.
- I'm washing my hands of the entire matter.

53
00:03:39,631 --> 00:03:43,758
- Wouldn't miss it for the world though, would you?
- I'll be there at seven with a cheeky Bordeaux.

54
00:03:51,348 --> 00:03:54,681
No, no, no.  
Daphne, I was very specific about this.
The mayor's plaque goes on the piano...

55
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:59,595
The Otis Klandenning "Man of the Year Award" 
goes right over here...

56
00:04:00,688 --> 00:04:05,432
And my jewel — my SeaBea — goes right here 
where she can't miss it!

57
00:04:06,109 --> 00:04:07,686
Hmm, that seems a bit subtle.

58
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:12,236
- Why don't I just use this to serve the olives?
- Give me that!

59
00:04:15,533 --> 00:04:20,692
I wish someone would just tell me who this woman is, 
and why we're trying to impress the pants off her.

60
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:24,949
She's a one-time Boston barmaid 
who had a nervous breakdown 
and ended up in a sanitorium, 

61
00:04:25,123 --> 00:04:27,661
where I met her, 
fell for her,..

62
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:30,324
and then was so mercilessly rejected by her

63
00:04:31,128 --> 00:04:34,959
that to this day 
there is a sucking chest wound...

64
00:04:37,091 --> 00:04:39,628
...where once there dwelled a 
         heart!

65
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:51,800
You remember my brother Niles, 
my father Martin, 
and this is his health-care worker, Daphne Moon.

66
00:04:53,561 --> 00:04:58,021
- What a tasteful abode.
- Well, it's modest in its way.

67
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:02,056
No, that's what I like about it.
After the rambling beach house 
I've been living in,

68
00:05:02,234 --> 00:05:04,903
I'm ready for something smart and efficient.

69
00:05:08,447 --> 00:05:13,523
White wine, Diane?  
I'm pouring an '85 Montrachet 
La Guiche I purchased at auction.

70
00:05:13,701 --> 00:05:16,867
Oh, I always keep a bottle of that 
open myself.

71
00:05:19,748 --> 00:05:21,787
Hang this up!

72
00:05:23,584 --> 00:05:26,667
Well, Martin, it's been too long. 
How have you been?

73
00:05:26,836 --> 00:05:29,077
Well, my wife died, 
I got shot in the hip,

74
00:05:29,255 --> 00:05:33,999
and I had to move in with Frasier 
'cause I kept falling down in the shower.

75
00:05:36,051 --> 00:05:38,090
Well, you look wonderful!

76
00:05:39,179 --> 00:05:40,637
Yes, you do!

77
00:05:41,806 --> 00:05:44,213
That's the bad one.

78
00:05:48,311 --> 00:05:51,145
Niles, do you remember the last time 
I was in town and we dined together? 

79
00:05:51,313 --> 00:05:56,270
You had just started dating this woman — 
she was the queerest little creature. 

80
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:03,188
She ate everyone's sorbet, and
then she had to lie down 
in the ladies' lounge

81
00:06:03,364 --> 00:06:06,862
while the coat-check girl 
massaged her abdomen!

82
00:06:12,162 --> 00:06:14,201
Oh, I hope I haven't put my foot in it.

83
00:06:14,372 --> 00:06:17,407
You and she didn't get married 
and live happily ever after, did you?

84
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:19,824
No, can't say as we did.

85
00:06:22,753 --> 00:06:24,959
- Care for an olive?
- Oh, thank you.

86
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:30,419
These are a Pyreenean taste treat!
They're handpicked and bottled 
by Andalusian monks!

87
00:06:30,592 --> 00:06:32,750
You can spit the pits in here.

88
00:06:42,393 --> 00:06:46,603
So, there I was, on the balcony 
of my Malibu beachhouse,

89
00:06:46,771 --> 00:06:48,810
when a pod of whales passed by.

90
00:06:48,981 --> 00:06:52,017
I knew I had to commune 
with these gentle giants,

91
00:06:52,192 --> 00:06:58,276
...so like a flash, I was on the beach, 
scrambling to my kayak.

92
00:06:59,489 --> 00:07:03,533
But cruel fortune interceded, 
when, not twenty yards offshore,

93
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:08,077
I suddenly discovered myself 
entangled in an enormous bed of-of, um—

94
00:07:08,246 --> 00:07:10,036
- Sea kelp?
- Exactly right, sea kelp!

95
00:07:11,623 --> 00:07:14,956
Oh, that's funny — I thought he said 
"seek help."

96
00:07:21,672 --> 00:07:24,589
So, you haven't told us 
how you've come to be in Seattle.

97
00:07:24,758 --> 00:07:28,885
Oh, a small theater group has decided 
to produce a play I've written.

98
00:07:29,053 --> 00:07:34,675
- Which one?
- Oh, my most recent work.  
It's a sort of feminist odyssey, 
experimental in places,

99
00:07:34,849 --> 00:07:38,596
in tone akin to Saroyan, 
with a soupçon of Gide,

100
00:07:38,768 --> 00:07:41,769
and a hearty nod 
to Clifford Odets!

101
00:07:42,605 --> 00:07:44,763
I meant which theater?

102
00:07:46,149 --> 00:07:49,149
- Oh!  The Roundabout.
- That seems appropriate.

103
00:07:53,655 --> 00:07:57,568
You know, why don't you people 
just keep talking amongst yourselves? 
I will go and fetch the profiteroles.

104
00:07:57,741 --> 00:08:01,690
They were prepared 
by the hottest new pastry chef in... 
oh, what's the use?

105
00:08:04,913 --> 00:08:07,582
I'll help.
He always overpowders.

106
00:08:08,332 --> 00:08:14,203
Yeah, I'm sure Old Man Kennedy 
felt this kind of pride 
when his boys would go out 
and play touch football.

107
00:08:14,378 --> 00:08:18,458
Now, Frasier, you know her better than I.  
Is that what she looks like 
when she's writhing in envy?

108
00:08:18,632 --> 00:08:20,671
Oh, shut up.

109
00:08:22,843 --> 00:08:29,046
All right, I admit you were right.  
Before she leaves here tonight, 
I am going to tell her 
how much pain she made me feel.

110
00:08:30,265 --> 00:08:34,179
The savage truth this time — 
there will be no sugarcoating it!

111
00:08:34,352 --> 00:08:36,807
And yes, I am aware of the irony!

112
00:08:38,897 --> 00:08:42,099
Oh, it must be wonderful 
to see your words come to life like that.

113
00:08:42,274 --> 00:08:45,109
Oh yes.  It's a dream come true.

114
00:08:48,112 --> 00:08:50,603
- Diane, are you OK?
- Yes, I'm fine.  Why?

115
00:08:50,781 --> 00:08:54,908
- Well, your cheek was kind of twitching.
- It was?

116
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:59,906
- Oh well, it was probably fatigue.  
Where were we?
- Oh, I was asking about your play.

117
00:09:00,079 --> 00:09:02,949
- Oh, right!
- There it goes again, the twitch!

118
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,040
That was either a very large twitch 
or a very small seizure.

119
00:09:11,254 --> 00:09:16,164
You know, I'm not sure how much 
I really want to talk 
about my play right now.

120
00:09:21,179 --> 00:09:23,218
Bad luck and all that!

121
00:09:24,389 --> 00:09:27,639
Yes, and we all know what a struggle it is

122
00:09:27,809 --> 00:09:30,513
to get Diane to talk about herself.

123
00:09:30,686 --> 00:09:32,761
Oh Frasier, you always could kid!

124
00:09:34,355 --> 00:09:36,394
How I miss that!

125
00:09:46,823 --> 00:09:50,072
Look, Diane, please, 
I-I really didn't mean anything by it. 
I'm sorry—

126
00:09:50,242 --> 00:09:54,737
It's not that!
It's my whole life, it's ruined!

127
00:09:54,912 --> 00:09:58,909
- Niles, could you please get her some water?
- Of course, of course.

128
00:09:59,082 --> 00:10:02,248
Oh, everything I told you tonight is a lie.

129
00:10:04,628 --> 00:10:06,834
I'm sorry for this.

130
00:10:07,922 --> 00:10:12,583
- Oh, I must look just awful.
- Your cheek stopped jumping.

131
00:10:17,137 --> 00:10:20,588
All right, now.  Tell me what happened.  
Was it about your play?

132
00:10:21,599 --> 00:10:23,638
There it goes again!

133
00:10:25,685 --> 00:10:27,724
Look, would you people please 
just give us some privacy?!

134
00:10:36,277 --> 00:10:38,684
All right now.  From the beginning.

135
00:10:38,862 --> 00:10:44,199
Well, it all started a few months ago 
when I lost my job.

136
00:10:44,366 --> 00:10:48,742
I'd been writing for 
"Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman."

137
00:10:48,911 --> 00:10:52,659
I was on the set one day, 
and I was trying to show Jane Seymour

138
00:10:52,831 --> 00:10:56,779
the proper way to cauterize 
a wound with a branding iron,

139
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,710
and I accidentally 
set her hair on fire.

140
00:11:03,672 --> 00:11:07,669
Well, from there 
it was a steady slide downhill.

141
00:11:07,842 --> 00:11:10,130
A two-year relationship ended.

142
00:11:10,302 --> 00:11:13,670
I lost the beach house,
friends stopped calling —

143
00:11:13,846 --> 00:11:17,795
the one bright spot 
was my play in Seattle.

144
00:11:18,892 --> 00:11:23,517
Well, I flew up here yesterday 
only to find that the backer 
was pulling out.

145
00:11:25,272 --> 00:11:29,979
I was so distraught 
I found myself wandering around the city 
in complete despair.

146
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,977
It's then that like a ray of hope 
from heaven,

147
00:11:35,154 --> 00:11:38,487
I saw your smiling face 
on the side of a bus.

148
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:45,619
And that's why I'm here today.

149
00:11:45,787 --> 00:11:49,570
You helped me the only other time 
I was this low.

150
00:11:49,748 --> 00:11:52,832
Frasier, I'm asking 
for your help again.

151
00:11:55,294 --> 00:11:57,417
Of course I'll help you, Diane.

152
00:11:59,756 --> 00:12:05,129
- Well, that was a bit scary.
- I'll say — watching someone 
go completely crackers like that.

153
00:12:07,261 --> 00:12:10,131
- What's the matter with you now?
- Nothing, I'm fine.

154
00:12:10,305 --> 00:12:12,428
Just suddenly missing my Maris.

155
00:12:17,811 --> 00:12:20,895
INTERPLAY

156
00:12:22,231 --> 00:12:25,979
My God, Niles, 
it's such a glorious day!
I walked all the way here.

157
00:12:26,151 --> 00:12:28,819
Thirty-two blocks, 
and Bruno Maglies be damned!

158
00:12:30,612 --> 00:12:36,234
Oh yes, I see the look, 
I know exactly what it means too. 
How could I very well say "no" to Diane? 
She came to me in crisis.

159
00:12:36,408 --> 00:12:39,658
Oh, excuse me, 
a double cappuccino, please, 
light cinnamon, 
thank you very much.

160
00:12:41,787 --> 00:12:44,953
Oh, you know, the change in Diane 
has really been quite gratifying.

161
00:12:45,123 --> 00:12:51,125
Dropped her off at the theater today, 
and there was a smile on her face 
that I haven't seen in...

162
00:12:51,711 --> 00:12:53,751
well, far too many years.

163
00:12:53,921 --> 00:12:57,005
Oh, I know what you're thinking. 
Where did she get the money to do the play?

164
00:12:57,174 --> 00:12:59,213
Well, she found a backer!

165
00:13:00,051 --> 00:13:02,090
It's tax deductible!

166
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:09,593
Thank you.  
Oh, why don't you go ahead and say 
what you're thinking, Niles?  
That I'm falling for her again.

167
00:13:09,767 --> 00:13:14,344
"Well, you did bounce in here 
as though you were on top of the world, 
and babbling about her smile" 
— I just don't want to  hear it, Niles!

168
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:18,564
I'm simply helping her 
to get back on her feet 
and out of my life as quickly as possible.

169
00:13:18,732 --> 00:13:20,973
No, I don't know 
how long it's going to take.

170
00:13:22,151 --> 00:13:24,439
Look, I said I don't know!

171
00:13:24,611 --> 00:13:29,189
Oh, really, Niles!  
Curse you, you are the most 
infuriating busybody!  
I'm not sitting with you.

172
00:13:37,538 --> 00:13:39,197
FOREPLAY

173
00:13:39,372 --> 00:13:41,530
It really is a lovely city.

174
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:47,451
"Night — making all things dimly beautiful..."

175
00:13:47,628 --> 00:13:51,127
"...One veil over us both."
Cyrano?

176
00:13:52,215 --> 00:13:55,418
Yes.  Eleven years later, 
we're still on the same page.

177
00:13:55,593 --> 00:13:59,424
Frasier, these past few weeks, 
you've given so much of yourself to me.

178
00:13:59,596 --> 00:14:03,545
I want to give the one gift 
I have to bestow.

179
00:14:03,724 --> 00:14:08,052
I want you to be the first person 
to see my play.  
Will you come to dress rehearsal tonight?

180
00:14:08,227 --> 00:14:10,896
- Diane, I'd be honored.
- Oh, wonderful, wonderful!

181
00:14:11,563 --> 00:14:14,848
