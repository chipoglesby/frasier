1
00:00:09,781 --> 00:00:11,641
Go ahead, Tom.  I'm listening.

2
00:00:11,641 --> 00:00:12,630
Hi, Dr. Crane.

3
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:14,945
Uh, it's about my girlfriend.

4
00:00:14,945 --> 00:00:17,584
My problem is, I don't know 
if I love her for herself

5
00:00:17,584 --> 00:00:20,306
Or because things are so great
between us physically.

6
00:00:20,306 --> 00:00:22,143
Well, how long have you two been together?

7
00:00:22,143 --> 00:00:25,632
Six years.

8
00:00:25,632 --> 00:00:30,216
And the sex is still that good?

9
00:00:30,216 --> 00:00:32,652
Oh man, Dr. Crane, every morning, night,

10
00:00:32,652 --> 00:00:34,700
three times a day on weekends.

11
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,681
But I'm not sure we have much else in common.

12
00:00:36,681 --> 00:00:39,355
Well, common interests are of
course the foundation of...

13
00:00:39,355 --> 00:00:43,229
three times, you say?

14
00:00:43,229 --> 00:00:44,585
Is that abnormal?

15
00:00:44,585 --> 00:00:48,524
Well, uh, no, no, it's not abnormal.

16
00:00:48,524 --> 00:00:51,473
It's not fair, but it's not abnormal.

17
00:00:51,473 --> 00:00:55,352
Um, but you know, perhaps you
share more things than you

18
00:00:55,352 --> 00:00:56,989
think you do actually.

19
00:00:56,989 --> 00:00:58,465
I'll tell you what, try this:

20
00:00:58,465 --> 00:01:01,525
why don't you pick up a catalogue
from a local university,

21
00:01:01,525 --> 00:01:02,456
go through it with her and see if

22
00:01:02,456 --> 00:01:04,615
there are any courses you'd like to take together?

23
00:01:04,615 --> 00:01:07,004
That's a good idea!  Thanks, Doc.

24
00:01:07,004 --> 00:01:08,013
Have a great weekend.

25
00:01:08,013 --> 00:01:12,743
Well, I'd wish you the same but
it hardly seems necessary.

26
00:01:12,743 --> 00:01:13,967
Well, that's it for today, Seattle.

27
00:01:13,967 --> 00:01:18,756
This is Dr. Frasier Crane,
wishing you all good mental health.

28
00:01:18,756 --> 00:01:19,989
Niles called from the airport;

29
00:01:19,989 --> 00:01:20,901
he wants you to call him back.

30
00:01:20,901 --> 00:01:23,032
He sounded frantic!

31
00:01:23,032 --> 00:01:24,485
I'll call him from the car.

32
00:01:24,485 --> 00:01:27,000
He's flying to a conference in Switzerland;

33
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,635
I promised to talkhim through it.

34
00:01:28,635 --> 00:01:30,248
Surely he's flown before?

35
00:01:30,248 --> 00:01:35,967
Well, not coach!

36
00:01:35,967 --> 00:01:39,142
Roz, is this the dress you're
wearing to the wedding?

37
00:01:39,142 --> 00:01:41,128
I have to, I'm a bridesmaid.

38
00:01:41,128 --> 00:01:43,527
Is there a reason it has to be so, so...?

39
00:01:43,527 --> 00:01:45,021
Hideous?

40
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:47,323
It's supposed to be, so that way, the bride,

41
00:01:47,323 --> 00:01:51,387
By comparison, will glow!

44
00:01:57,546 --> 00:02:00,623
this girl was the last one I thought
would beat me to the altar.

45
00:02:00,623 --> 00:02:04,288
Not the Dairy State's comeliest chunk of cheddar?

46
00:02:04,288 --> 00:02:06,369
Let's just say she works in her
father's ice cream parlour

47
00:02:06,369 --> 00:02:09,413
and she eats her mistakes.

48
00:02:09,413 --> 00:02:10,905
The groom's family makes cones.

49
00:02:10,905 --> 00:02:15,039
Oh, well, we don't need Freud for that, do we?

50
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:18,170
The whole thing is just so depressing.

51
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:21,236
Lately everyone I know is settling down,

52
00:02:21,236 --> 00:02:24,215
getting married, having children.

53
00:02:24,215 --> 00:02:26,261
What am I doing wrong?

54
00:02:26,261 --> 00:02:28,824
Well, do you want me to answer
as a friend, or a therapist?

55
00:02:28,824 --> 00:02:30,238
As a friend!

56
00:02:30,238 --> 00:02:31,617
See a therapist.

57
00:02:31,617 --> 00:02:33,478
Frasier!

58
00:02:33,478 --> 00:02:35,990
Well, Roz, I think your whole problem stems from

59
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:39,759
some unresolved issues that cause you
to choose the men you date.

60
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:42,759
Always flashy and superficial,
offering no prospect

61
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:45,420
of a lasting relationship.

62
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:46,912
Why would I do that?

63
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:50,208
Maybe fear of commitment, fear of being hurt.

64
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:53,805
But maybe it's time you started
looking at different kinds of men.

65
00:02:53,805 --> 00:02:57,314
You know, men who are more settled,
a little less flash

66
00:02:57,314 --> 00:02:59,506
and more substance.

67
00:02:59,506 --> 00:03:01,425
You're probably right, Frasier.

68
00:03:01,425 --> 00:03:02,239
Hey, if I were smart,

69
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:09,212
I'd go out with the next guy I see
I'm not the least bit attracted to.

70
00:03:09,212 --> 00:03:10,580
Roth, Roth, I juth bit my tongue.

71
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:13,091
Can you kith it and make it better?

72
00:03:13,091 --> 00:03:15,960
The next one after him.

73
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,179
Oh, Doc, Doc.

74
00:03:17,179 --> 00:03:18,418
Here's my video camera.

75
00:03:18,418 --> 00:03:19,886
Oh, thank you, Bulldog.

76
00:03:19,886 --> 00:03:20,983
What do you need it for?

77
00:03:20,983 --> 00:03:22,297
Well, I'm going to record my father.

78
00:03:22,297 --> 00:03:25,660
I'm going to have hislife on tape
so Frederick can enjoy it in years to come.

79
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:26,792
What a good idea!

80
00:03:26,792 --> 00:03:30,029
Whoa!  That's the ugliest thing I ever saw!

81
00:03:30,029 --> 00:03:31,261
I'm going to a wedding.

82
00:03:31,261 --> 00:03:32,317
Oh, I love weddings.

83
00:03:32,317 --> 00:03:35,519
Never been to a wedding where
I didn'tbag at least one bridesmaid.

84
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,188
And the uglier the dress, thequicker
they want to get out of them.

85
00:03:39,188 --> 00:03:43,780
This one would hit the floor before the rice!

86
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:45,433
I've got to get going.

87
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:48,103
Can you believe I actually have to
be seen in public in this thing?

88
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:49,446
Well, Roz, it's only for a few hours.

89
00:03:49,446 --> 00:03:53,212
After that you can donate it
to the Salvation Army...

90
00:03:53,212 --> 00:03:55,678
and one day make some Irish drag queen very happy.

91
00:04:01,514 --> 00:04:03,091
What's the point of going to
Switzerland without spending a

92
00:04:03,091 --> 00:04:03,987
day on the slopes?

93
00:04:03,987 --> 00:04:05,848
So I ducked out of the conference and who

94
00:04:05,848 --> 00:04:09,033
should I run into, but Maris?

95
00:04:09,033 --> 00:04:13,701
She'd just flown in for heryearly
goat placenta treatments!

96
00:04:13,701 --> 00:04:17,998
Good Lord, is it placenta
treatment time again already?

97
00:04:17,998 --> 00:04:19,527
We had a set-to on the slopes.

98
00:04:19,527 --> 00:04:21,802
She ran, I tried to followher tracks in the snow,

99
00:04:21,802 --> 00:04:27,010
but alas, she made none.

100
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:28,659
Oh, dear...

101
00:04:28,659 --> 00:04:29,648
What is it?  What's the matter?

102
00:04:29,648 --> 00:04:31,626
I just spotted someone.

103
00:04:31,626 --> 00:04:33,413
It's my least favorite patient.

104
00:04:33,413 --> 00:04:35,513
The man's a compulsive womaniser.

105
00:04:35,513 --> 00:04:38,732
He goes through so many women,
he calls them all by the same odious nickname,

106
00:04:38,732 --> 00:04:40,663
"Sunshine," to avoid slip-ups.

107
00:04:40,663 --> 00:04:42,184
Oh, God.

108
00:04:42,184 --> 00:04:45,003
Frasier, what do you do when
you don't like a patient?

109
00:04:45,003 --> 00:04:47,795
Well, it's a tricky subject, isn't it?

110
00:04:47,795 --> 00:04:48,979
How long have you been seeing him?

111
00:04:48,979 --> 00:04:49,664
Six months.

112
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:51,192
We've made no progress whatsover.

113
00:04:51,192 --> 00:04:55,255
Sometimes Ifeel he comes in not
so much for help as to brag.

114
00:04:55,255 --> 00:04:57,804
He claimsto have been with, at last count,

115
00:04:57,804 --> 00:04:59,895
one hundred and fifty women!

116
00:04:59,895 --> 00:05:01,109
Oh puh-leease!

117
00:05:01,109 --> 00:05:03,006
A hundred and fifty!

118
00:05:03,006 --> 00:05:08,665
As if anything over, say... seven weren't absurd.

119
00:05:08,665 --> 00:05:16,677
Well, I would say eleven, but I get your point.

120
00:05:16,677 --> 00:05:21,424
Oh, now serving one hundred and fifty-one.

121
00:05:21,424 --> 00:05:23,757
Good God!  He's here to see Roz?

122
00:05:23,757 --> 00:05:26,318
Yes, well, no doubt they met
when Sealy Posturepedic named

123
00:05:26,318 --> 00:05:29,284
them Man and Woman of the Year.

124
00:05:29,284 --> 00:05:30,584
Niles, you don't understand.

125
00:05:30,584 --> 00:05:33,227
She-she'sbeen very vulnerable lately.

126
00:05:33,227 --> 00:05:34,762
Well, I hope you'll forgive me
if I don't stick around.

127
00:05:34,762 --> 00:05:36,677
I'd like to leave before she makesintroductions.

128
00:05:36,677 --> 00:05:38,548
I've got to warn her!

129
00:05:38,548 --> 00:05:40,467
Warn her how?

130
00:05:40,467 --> 00:05:41,975
What I just told you was in strict confidence,

131
00:05:41,975 --> 00:05:42,936
therapist to therapist.

132
00:05:42,936 --> 00:05:43,723
You can't go repeating it!

133
00:05:43,723 --> 00:05:44,352
But-but-

134
00:05:44,352 --> 00:05:45,387
No!

135
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:47,401
Oh... of course, of course,
you're right, I won't.

136
00:05:47,401 --> 00:05:51,816
But that is the last man that Roz should be with!

137
00:05:51,816 --> 00:05:52,318
Well, don't worry.

138
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:56,281
Knowing Roz, he won't be.

139
00:05:56,281 --> 00:05:57,708
Hey, Frasier!

140
00:05:57,708 --> 00:05:58,655
Oh, Roz!

141
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:00,473
I'd like to introduce you to someone.

142
00:06:00,473 --> 00:06:02,332
This is Ben Collins.

143
00:06:02,332 --> 00:06:03,962
Frasier Crane, pleasure.

144
00:06:03,962 --> 00:06:05,061
Likewise.

145
00:06:05,061 --> 00:06:06,132
Is it all right if we join you?

146
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:07,577
Oh, why not??

147
00:06:07,577 --> 00:06:11,605
I'll grab our coffees.

148
00:06:11,605 --> 00:06:14,100
He is the greatest guy!

149
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,899
You know, when I first met him,
I thought, "He's not my type."

150
00:06:16,899 --> 00:06:18,806
Then I remembered what you said.

151
00:06:18,806 --> 00:06:20,871
And I'm so glad you gave me that advice, Frasier,

152
00:06:20,871 --> 00:06:23,405
because without it, I would never
have given him a second look.

153
00:06:23,405 --> 00:06:27,682
Well, Roz, let's not rule out
that all-important third look.

154
00:06:27,682 --> 00:06:29,700
Would you stop worrying about me, Frasier?

155
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:30,951
This one'sdifferent.

156
00:06:30,951 --> 00:06:32,929
I can tell he really cares about me.

157
00:06:32,929 --> 00:06:35,075
Here you go, Sunshine!

158
00:06:45,953 --> 00:06:47,522
Why can't you be like other dogs?

159
00:06:47,522 --> 00:06:55,377
Why can't you bring home bones
or animals you kill?

160
00:06:55,377 --> 00:06:57,428
Give me those!

161
00:06:57,428 --> 00:07:02,421
Relax, I'm just going to put them
with the roses you picked yesterday.

162
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:05,293
Oh hey, Dad!  Fresh from your walk?

163
00:07:05,293 --> 00:07:08,492
I think now is as good a time as
any to crank up the ol' camcorder.

164
00:07:08,492 --> 00:07:09,709
Nah, maybe later.

165
00:07:09,709 --> 00:07:12,219
Oh Dad, you've been saying "no" for weeks now!

166
00:07:12,219 --> 00:07:15,673
Well, gee, some people would take that for a hint!

167
00:07:15,673 --> 00:07:18,141
All you have to do is just sit
here and talk about yourlife.

168
00:07:18,141 --> 00:07:19,593
Life's got nothing to do with it!

169
00:07:19,593 --> 00:07:20,911
This is about me dying and you having

170
00:07:20,911 --> 00:07:23,908
something to look at after I'm dead.

171
00:07:23,908 --> 00:07:25,664
The wholething gives me the creeps!

172
00:07:25,664 --> 00:07:29,109
I can't believe you're refusing to record your history,

173
00:07:29,109 --> 00:07:31,664
thestory that only you, Martin Crane, can tell,

174
00:07:31,664 --> 00:07:33,804
because it gives you the creeps!

175
00:07:33,804 --> 00:07:36,263
OK then, I'll tell you the real truth.

176
00:07:36,263 --> 00:07:40,367
My Indian heritage forbids it.

177
00:07:40,367 --> 00:07:46,183
I'm afraid your magic box will rob me of my spirit.

178
00:07:46,183 --> 00:07:47,616
I don't know why you're being so negative about this.

179
00:07:47,616 --> 00:07:48,921
It'snot really for when you're dead.

180
00:07:48,921 --> 00:07:52,436
It's for when you've lostyour mind.

181
00:07:52,436 --> 00:07:53,039
Hey, Frasier.

182
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,303
Oh hello, Roz!

183
00:07:54,303 --> 00:07:55,868
Why, after waiting for forty-five minutes,

184
00:07:55,868 --> 00:07:58,251
did I assume you'd forgotten our appointment?

185
00:07:58,251 --> 00:08:02,021
Sorry, but uh... I was on my way out, when Ben called.

186
00:08:02,021 --> 00:08:03,410
Oh yes... Ben.

187
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:04,840
Oh, what's with you?

188
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,319
Every time I bring him up, you make thatface.

189
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:10,076
I'm getting the sense that you
don't like him that much.

190
00:08:10,076 --> 00:08:11,595
It's just that I know something about Ben...

191
00:08:11,595 --> 00:08:14,067
What?

192
00:08:14,067 --> 00:08:16,184
He's a little old for you.

193
00:08:16,184 --> 00:08:17,650
He's thirty-six!

194
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:18,392
Exactly my point!

195
00:08:18,392 --> 00:08:19,576
When you were a freshman, he was a senior.

196
00:08:19,576 --> 00:08:21,185
That never works out!

197
00:08:21,185 --> 00:08:22,448
I'm getting my briefcase!

198
00:08:22,448 --> 00:08:24,846
I'll go get a Coke.

199
00:08:24,846 --> 00:08:26,000
Oh, hi, Daphne!

200
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,646
Hello, Roz.  How are you?

201
00:08:27,646 --> 00:08:30,829
OK... can I ask you something?

202
00:08:30,829 --> 00:08:32,787
Does Frasier seem weird to you-?

203
00:08:32,787 --> 00:08:35,908
Oh God, yes.

204
00:08:35,908 --> 00:08:37,443
I haven't finished my question yet.

205
00:08:37,443 --> 00:08:38,843
Yes, well, when you know the answer,

206
00:08:38,843 --> 00:08:42,273
it's hard not to hit thebuzzer.

207
00:08:42,273 --> 00:08:43,931
Well, this is strange.

208
00:08:43,931 --> 00:08:45,925
I mean, for the first time in years,

209
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:47,632
I'm in a really solid relationship,

210
00:08:47,632 --> 00:08:51,329
and instead of being happy for me,
Frasier seems upset.

211
00:08:51,329 --> 00:08:56,185
Oh, that is odd.  Unless...

212
00:08:56,185 --> 00:08:57,550
Unless what?

213
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:58,953
Well...

214
00:08:58,953 --> 00:09:02,526
Dr. Crane is jealous of Benbecause
he wants you for himself.

215
00:09:02,526 --> 00:09:04,405
Huh?

216
00:09:04,405 --> 00:09:07,305
Ohhh, no, no, no!

217
00:09:07,305 --> 00:09:08,954
Yes, what else could it be?

218
00:09:08,954 --> 00:09:10,193
Fra-Frasier?

219
00:09:10,193 --> 00:09:11,486
What, you really think so?

220
00:09:11,486 --> 00:09:15,186
Daphne, no!  No way!  No, he doesn't -

221
00:09:15,186 --> 00:09:18,514
Frasier is the one who told me to
find myself a new boyfriend.

222
00:09:18,514 --> 00:09:20,837
Someone who is settled, someone more nurturing, someone

223
00:09:20,837 --> 00:09:22,594
with substance over flash.

224
00:09:22,594 --> 00:09:26,282
They could put that on Dr. Crane's tombstone.

225
00:09:26,282 --> 00:09:27,647
Oh, come on!  No way!

226
00:09:27,647 --> 00:09:29,357
Yes!  Wait, there's something else.

227
00:09:29,357 --> 00:09:30,596
What?

228
00:09:30,596 --> 00:09:31,912
I probably shouldn't tell you this.

229
00:09:31,912 --> 00:09:34,785
But earlier this morning, Dr. Crane was on the phone

230
00:09:34,785 --> 00:09:36,224
with his brother and he said that

231
00:09:36,224 --> 00:09:39,146
your relationship with Ben was driving him crazy,

232
00:09:39,146 --> 00:09:41,554
and that he was dying to tell you but he can't.

233
00:09:41,554 --> 00:09:44,615
Oh my God, did you hear him say that?!

234
00:09:44,615 --> 00:09:45,892
I certainly did!

235
00:09:45,892 --> 00:09:48,091
Oh, this is too weird, this is too weird!

236
00:09:48,091 --> 00:09:49,059
What am I going to say?

237
00:09:49,059 --> 00:09:50,195
Maybe I won't say anything.

238
00:09:50,195 --> 00:09:51,800
Maybe he'll just see how happy I am with Ben.

239
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,302
Oh, Ben, Ben, Ben!

240
00:09:53,302 --> 00:09:55,232
My God, Roz, would you just drop it with

241
00:09:55,232 --> 00:09:59,816
Ben for a minute and pay some attention to me?

242
00:09:59,816 --> 00:10:01,241
Oh-kaay!

243
00:10:09,223 --> 00:10:10,194
Morning, Roz!

244
00:10:10,194 --> 00:10:11,066
Hi, Frasier!

245
00:10:11,066 --> 00:10:13,843
Hey, you look lovely, that
colour's very flattering!

246
00:10:13,843 --> 00:10:14,557
Thanks.

247
00:10:14,557 --> 00:10:16,620
You know, I think this calls for a hug!

248
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:17,637
Oh, I don't look that good.

249
00:10:17,637 --> 00:10:20,183
No, no, no, no, Roz.

250
00:10:20,183 --> 00:10:20,969
Look!

251
00:10:20,969 --> 00:10:22,860
My God, the ratings are in,
and we did better in our timeslot

252
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,324
this week than ever before!

253
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:28,891
Congratulations, partner!

254
00:10:28,891 --> 00:10:31,890
Why don't we have dinner tonight, celebrate?

255
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:36,326
That sounds so fun... but I kinda have plans.

256
00:10:36,326 --> 00:10:37,566
I should have known.

257
00:10:37,566 --> 00:10:39,015
Another time, perhaps.

258
00:10:39,015 --> 00:10:41,665
Yeah sure, that sounds great.

259
00:10:41,665 --> 00:10:42,538
Yo, Doc.

260
00:10:42,538 --> 00:10:43,987
When are you going to return my video camera?

261
00:10:43,987 --> 00:10:46,301
I got a hot date tonight and
I want to record certain events

262
00:10:46,301 --> 00:10:48,818
for posterity, if you know what I mean.

263
00:10:48,818 --> 00:10:50,377
Uh... tomorrow, Bulldog.

264
00:10:50,377 --> 00:10:53,279
Well, maybe tonight you could
just have a police sketch artist

265
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:57,995
crouch on your balcony.

266
00:10:57,995 --> 00:10:59,997
So Mom, let me ask you something.

267
00:10:59,997 --> 00:11:03,354
How long did you know Dad before
you told him youloved him?

268
00:11:03,354 --> 00:11:07,001
Mom?  Mom?  Mom, you've been
divorced fifteen years!

269
00:11:07,001 --> 00:11:09,922
Let it go!

270
00:11:09,922 --> 00:11:13,132
Listen, Ben is coming over to
dinner tonight, and I think

271
00:11:13,132 --> 00:11:15,977
I'm going to tell him I love him.

272
00:11:15,977 --> 00:11:17,306
I gotta work, bye!

273
00:11:17,306 --> 00:11:18,620
Oh I'm, I'm sorry, Roz.

274
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,008
I should have knocked.

275
00:11:20,008 --> 00:11:21,421
It's OK, it's OK, it's OK!

276
00:11:21,421 --> 00:11:27,253
I couldn't help overhearing the
last part of your conversation there.

277
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:30,413
You think you're not rushing
things a little bit with Ben?

278
00:11:30,413 --> 00:11:32,815
Are you really that serious?

279
00:11:32,815 --> 00:11:34,199
Yes, I am.

280
00:11:34,199 --> 00:11:37,491
But you know, there are a lot of men in the world.

281
00:11:37,491 --> 00:11:41,643
And lots of women, too!

282
00:11:41,643 --> 00:11:45,916
Well, that's more of a personal preference but I...

283
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:47,824
I meant for you!

284
00:11:47,824 --> 00:11:50,841
Look, Frasier, what I'm trying to say is

285
00:11:50,841 --> 00:11:53,265
I know you have a problem with me and Ben,

286
00:11:53,265 --> 00:11:56,356
but we're happy together.

287
00:11:56,356 --> 00:11:58,997
Well, it's just that you've only
been going out for a month!

288
00:11:58,997 --> 00:12:01,601
Well, sometimes, that's all it takes.

289
00:12:01,601 --> 00:12:03,751
Fifteen seconds!

290
00:12:03,751 --> 00:12:06,907
Listen Frasier, I'd like to think that

291
00:12:06,907 --> 00:12:09,719
there's some small part of you that is happy for me.

292
00:12:09,719 --> 00:12:13,664
Afterall, it WAS your advice that got me this far!

293
00:12:13,664 --> 00:12:15,419
Of course I'm happy for you.

294
00:12:15,419 --> 00:12:19,216
Thanks.

295
00:12:19,216 --> 00:12:23,367
Me and my stupid advice...

296
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:27,218
will be with you for the next
three hours, Seattle!

297
00:12:30,439 --> 00:12:31,836
I'm not doing it, it's morbid.

298
00:12:31,836 --> 00:12:33,030
It's not morbid.

299
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:34,207
And besides, if you don't do it,

300
00:12:34,207 --> 00:12:36,528
the only footage we'll have of
you in the family archives is you

301
00:12:36,528 --> 00:12:41,108
pretending your stomach was a face
that summer at the lake.

302
00:12:41,108 --> 00:12:43,429
Alright Niles, if it'll shut you up, I'll do it.

303
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:44,570
Thanks, Dad!

304
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:48,085
We'll make this quick and easy.

305
00:12:48,085 --> 00:12:48,906
Is that what you're wearing?

306
00:12:48,906 --> 00:12:49,469
Forget it.

307
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:50,906
No, no no, all right.

308
00:12:50,906 --> 00:12:54,491
Here we go, here we go.

309
00:12:54,491 --> 00:12:55,241
OK...

310
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:56,874
My name's Martin Crane.

311
00:12:56,874 --> 00:13:00,886
When I made this tape, I was sixty-four years old.

312
00:13:00,886 --> 00:13:08,587
But now... I'm DEAD!

313
00:13:08,587 --> 00:13:12,529
Trapped in a box, underground...

314
00:13:12,529 --> 00:13:17,391
Pretty scary, huh?

315
00:13:17,391 --> 00:13:20,035
Dad, surely you must have some
message you want to leave for

316
00:13:20,035 --> 00:13:21,616
the Cranes of the twenty-first century?

317
00:13:21,616 --> 00:13:26,122
Alright, alright, I do.

318
00:13:26,122 --> 00:13:28,355
Remember to always work hard,

319
00:13:28,355 --> 00:13:31,428
and that family comes first.

320
00:13:31,428 --> 00:13:36,484
And... I have a million bucks in unmarked bills

321
00:13:36,484 --> 00:13:37,924
that I took off a drug dealer that

322
00:13:37,924 --> 00:13:42,687
I have stashed in my old army foot locker.

323
00:13:42,687 --> 00:13:48,041
The combination is left fifteen, right thirty-two,

324
00:13:48,041 --> 00:14:02,726
le-le...

325
00:14:02,726 --> 00:14:07,465
Future generations: see what I had to put up with?

326
00:14:07,465 --> 00:14:08,084
Hello.

327
00:14:08,084 --> 00:14:08,639
Hello.

328
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,139
Hello.

329
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:10,445
I suppose this means we're finished?

330
00:14:10,445 --> 00:14:14,861
Well, unless you want future
generations to see me go to the can!

331
00:14:14,861 --> 00:14:16,177
Niles, actually I'm glad you're here.

332
00:14:16,177 --> 00:14:17,490
I have to talk to youabout Roz.

333
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:18,582
Oh, no, no, no.

334
00:14:18,582 --> 00:14:19,774
I've breached my ethics once already.

335
00:14:19,774 --> 00:14:21,358
Niles, please, I've gotten desperate!

336
00:14:21,358 --> 00:14:22,291
No, no, no!

337
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:25,409
Niles, she plans to tell him that
she loves him tonight!

338
00:14:25,409 --> 00:14:28,229
From what you told me about Ben's patterns,

339
00:14:28,229 --> 00:14:30,523
that will be the end of it
and Roz will be shattered.

340
00:14:30,523 --> 00:14:34,401
God, there has got to be some loophole
in this confidentiality rule that

341
00:14:34,401 --> 00:14:37,842
will allow me to warn her
and still preserve your ethics.

342
00:14:37,842 --> 00:14:41,335
Niles!  Help me look through these textbooks!

343
00:14:41,335 --> 00:14:42,318
No, I'll have no part in this!

344
00:14:42,318 --> 00:14:43,841
Please, Niles!  Think of Roz!

345
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:45,068
I'm thinking of my license!

346
00:14:45,068 --> 00:14:46,935
Well then, think of what Freud said!

347
00:14:46,935 --> 00:14:54,151
"We are never so helplessly
unhappy as when we lose love."

348
00:14:54,151 --> 00:14:56,199
Oh, all right!

349
00:14:56,199 --> 00:14:58,333
But that was dirty pool, using a Freud quotation.

350
00:14:58,333 --> 00:15:00,739
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

351
00:15:00,739 --> 00:15:02,015
It's the Crane boys' kryptonite.

352
00:15:02,015 --> 00:15:04,052
I know, I know.  Thank you.

353
00:15:04,052 --> 00:15:08,903
Say, here's a possibility.

354
00:15:08,903 --> 00:15:11,641
According to this, it says we can warn her

355
00:15:11,641 --> 00:15:14,202
if he means to do her bodily harm.

356
00:15:14,202 --> 00:15:14,919
Does he?

357
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:15,605
No.

358
00:15:15,605 --> 00:15:18,490
Damn!

359
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:26,300
It would be so much easier
if Roz were mentally incompetent.

360
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,786
Go on...

361
00:15:27,786 --> 00:15:32,067
Well, then there'd be some
justification for protecting her.

362
00:15:32,067 --> 00:15:33,575
Is she irrational?

363
00:15:33,575 --> 00:15:36,475
She did attack a vending machine once,

364
00:15:36,475 --> 00:15:39,479
when a Twinkie came out of the Oreo chute.

365
00:15:39,479 --> 00:15:41,190
Borderline, borderline.

366
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,565
Does she ever act delusional?

367
00:15:42,565 --> 00:15:43,445
Well, she often claims that

368
00:15:43,445 --> 00:15:45,237
she is responsible for thesuccess of our show.

369
00:15:45,237 --> 00:15:47,555
Building, building.

370
00:15:47,555 --> 00:15:49,802
Does she display below-average intelligence?

371
00:15:49,802 --> 00:15:52,807
She once ordered a bottle of white Zinfandel!

372
00:15:52,807 --> 00:15:54,858
Jackpot!

373
00:15:54,858 --> 00:15:56,344
Go to her, she's a threat to herself!

374
00:15:56,344 --> 00:15:58,963
It's amazing they even let the woman drive!

375
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:02,627
Who is it?

376
00:16:02,627 --> 00:16:07,839
It's Frasier!

377
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:09,508
Oh my God!  What happened?

378
00:16:09,508 --> 00:16:11,274
He dumped me, Frasier!

379
00:16:11,274 --> 00:16:18,665
Oh, oh, honey!  I - come here.  Oh God...

380
00:16:18,665 --> 00:16:20,612
Everything was going great!

381
00:16:20,612 --> 00:16:23,043
Until I said "I love you, Ben."

382
00:16:23,043 --> 00:16:24,383
Then he got this look on his face,

383
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:31,027
like he'd taken a wrong turn
in a really bad neighbourhood!

384
00:16:31,027 --> 00:16:34,526
He didn't even touch the champagne.

385
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:39,272
Oh I'm... I'm sorry, Roz.  Here.

386
00:16:39,272 --> 00:16:41,703
Thank you.

387
00:16:41,703 --> 00:16:47,272
When you...

388
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:49,615
when you professed your love for him,

389
00:16:49,615 --> 00:16:54,092
uh... were you dressed like that?

390
00:16:54,092 --> 00:16:58,187
No!  After he left, I went in to change,

391
00:16:58,187 --> 00:17:03,291
and I saw all theseold bridesmaid
dresses hanging in the closet.

392
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:05,170
And that's when it hit me.

393
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:08,421
That's what I am, a bridesmaid!

394
00:17:08,421 --> 00:17:10,565
I might as well wear the uniform!

395
00:17:10,565 --> 00:17:14,923
Oh Roz, no, no!  Now, now, come on!

396
00:17:14,923 --> 00:17:17,181
Yes!

397
00:17:17,181 --> 00:17:18,470
Come on!  Now look, look, you know,

398
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,138
I find that whenever I'm low,

399
00:17:20,138 --> 00:17:24,248
it always lifts my spirits when
I just spruce up a bit.

400
00:17:24,248 --> 00:17:29,166
It wouldn't hurt to run a brush through your hair...

401
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:30,128
or through your teeth.

402
00:17:30,128 --> 00:17:33,464
Oh God!

403
00:17:33,464 --> 00:17:34,946
I must look awful!

404
00:17:34,946 --> 00:17:37,843
No, no, not at all.

405
00:17:37,843 --> 00:17:41,978
You're a big fat liar.

406
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:48,910
But you were right about Ben,
and I just didn't see it.

407
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:51,328
What made you come over here anyway?

408
00:17:51,328 --> 00:17:55,130
Well, actually, I was coming
over here to take one last stab

409
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:58,699
at convincing you that Ben was the wrong man for you.

410
00:17:58,699 --> 00:18:00,759
You deserve someone better, Roz.

411
00:18:00,759 --> 00:18:02,011
Oh, yeah,

412
00:18:02,011 --> 00:18:10,270
I'm a real catch!

413
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:16,222
Hell...

414
00:18:16,222 --> 00:18:19,126
Oh, now, things really aren't all as dark as they seem.

415
00:18:19,126 --> 00:18:25,852
You know, you're a-a beautiful, intelligent, desirable...

416
00:18:25,852 --> 00:18:29,264
Why don't you let me just take a stab at that, will you?

417
00:18:29,264 --> 00:18:31,631
I can't imagine any man not
thinking himself the luckiest

418
00:18:31,631 --> 00:18:34,402
in the world to be with you.

419
00:18:34,402 --> 00:18:37,028
You really do... think that, don't you?

420
00:18:37,028 --> 00:18:39,569
Yes, and I'm surprised you even had to ask me that.

421
00:18:39,569 --> 00:18:41,579
I guess I didn't.

422
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:50,620
I've known that you've had these
romanticfeelings toward me, for a while.

423
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:51,908
What?

424
00:18:51,908 --> 00:18:54,670
Oh come on!  Don't deny it.

425
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:58,803
Those hints about finding someone
with substance over style,

426
00:18:58,803 --> 00:19:00,731
the way you hated Ben.

427
00:19:00,731 --> 00:19:03,611
And then Daphne told me she overheard you telling Niles that

428
00:19:03,611 --> 00:19:05,744
you couldn't stop thinking about me and

429
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:07,152
wanted to tell me the truth!

430
00:19:07,152 --> 00:19:07,976
Daphne told you that?

431
00:19:07,976 --> 00:19:09,045
Yeah - don't be mad at her.

432
00:19:09,045 --> 00:19:10,321
No, no, I'm not.

433
00:19:10,321 --> 00:19:11,645
It's just that when she said that...

434
00:19:11,645 --> 00:19:12,564
No it's OK, Frasier.

435
00:19:12,564 --> 00:19:15,345
I'm glad she told me.

436
00:19:15,345 --> 00:19:18,782
The only thingkeeping me from
completely falling apart right now is

437
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:27,721
knowing that someone like you could be interested in me.

438
00:19:27,721 --> 00:19:41,701
Well, then... there's no point in denying it, is there?

439
00:19:41,701 --> 00:19:46,559
You know, maybe the idea of you and me isn't so crazy.

440
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,554
You are the kind of man I should be with!

441
00:19:49,554 --> 00:19:52,743
Smart, gentle...

442
00:19:52,743 --> 00:19:54,334
Ow!  I said gentle!

443
00:19:54,334 --> 00:19:56,899
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Roz.

444
00:19:56,899 --> 00:19:58,920
Uh, you know, it's just that there are so many...

445
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:02,184
I know, I know.  Workplace romances always fail.

446
00:20:02,184 --> 00:20:03,555
Exactly my point!

447
00:20:03,555 --> 00:20:05,028
And I'm on the rebound.

448
00:20:05,028 --> 00:20:06,832
I've got to give myself time toheal.

449
00:20:06,832 --> 00:20:11,274
Yes yes, lots of time.

450
00:20:11,274 --> 00:20:13,994
On the other hand, you are the
one who always says the best

451
00:20:13,994 --> 00:20:16,129
relationships start with friendship.

452
00:20:16,129 --> 00:20:18,287
Well, I do say that, yes.

453
00:20:18,287 --> 00:20:19,295
It's true, but...

454
00:20:19,295 --> 00:20:22,336
And we're friends, aren't we?

455
00:20:22,336 --> 00:20:24,177
We're very good friends.

456
00:20:24,177 --> 00:20:26,223
Right now we are both free.

457
00:20:26,223 --> 00:20:30,788
Oh well, in my case, painfully free.

458
00:20:30,788 --> 00:20:41,270
You know, maybe if we both went
into it with our eyes open...?

459
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:44,475
Oh no, what am I saying?

460
00:20:44,475 --> 00:20:47,493
My relationship with you is
probably the healthiest one

461
00:20:47,493 --> 00:20:49,414
I've ever had with a man!

462
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:50,754
I don't want to screw that up.

463
00:20:50,754 --> 00:20:52,546
Now that you mention it,

464
00:20:52,546 --> 00:20:56,411
my relationship with you isprobably
the best one I've ever had with a woman!

465
00:20:56,411 --> 00:21:04,280
Not that it's been much of a horse race, but...

466
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:09,110
To friendship?

467
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:19,375
Here's hoping the next time you
tell a man you love him, he says it back.

468
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:21,498
Well, let's see.

469
00:21:21,498 --> 00:21:24,689
I love you, Frasier.

470
00:21:24,689 --> 00:21:28,400
I love you too, Roz.

471
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,199
You gonna be alright?

472
00:21:29,199 --> 00:21:30,351
Yeah.

473
00:21:30,351 --> 00:21:32,132
Well, I'd better run.

474
00:21:32,132 --> 00:21:35,651
Yeah, my saying "I love you"
seems to have that effect onmen.

475
00:21:35,651 --> 00:21:39,106
No, no, I'll-I'll stay if you like!

476
00:21:39,106 --> 00:21:41,660
No, no.  Don't you worry about me.

477
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:43,402
I will not be alone.

478
00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:49,241
I will be sliding into a hot tub
with my good friends, Ben & Jerry.

479
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:50,540
See you tomorrow, Roz.

480
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:52,768
See you, Frasier.

481
00:22:14,196 --> 00:22:17,200
