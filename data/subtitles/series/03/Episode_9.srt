1
00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:15,706
This is Dr. Frasier Crane, 
wishing you all good mental health.

2
00:00:15,706 --> 00:00:16,560
Happy anniversary!

3
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,751
Oh, Roz!  Oh, this is so much fun, Roz!

4
00:00:18,751 --> 00:00:19,648
I got you one too!

5
00:00:19,648 --> 00:00:23,682
Oh, thank you!  O.K., you first.

6
00:00:23,682 --> 00:00:25,066
I mean, it's nothing really,

7
00:00:25,066 --> 00:00:27,170
it's not expensive or anything, 
you probably won't even like it,

8
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:28,163
I'm not good with gifts?

9
00:00:28,163 --> 00:00:31,985
Look, don't oversell it, Roz.

10
00:00:31,985 --> 00:00:36,017
It's a tape.

11
00:00:36,017 --> 00:00:44,362
"The Dr. Frasier Crane Show: 
Show #1, May 21st, 1993."

12
00:00:44,362 --> 00:00:45,273
It's our first broadcast.

13
00:00:45,273 --> 00:00:46,584
Oh, Roz!

14
00:00:46,584 --> 00:00:49,107
I can't wait to listen to it!

15
00:00:49,107 --> 00:00:50,666
Did you ever think I'd stay on 
the air this long?

16
00:00:50,666 --> 00:00:55,154
Oh, hell no.

17
00:00:55,154 --> 00:00:57,960
"To Roz, who believed in me from the start."

18
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:04,600
Yes, it's from Hallmark's "Irony" section.

19
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,780
Oh, Frasier, they're beautiful!

20
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:08,771
Earrings!

21
00:01:08,771 --> 00:01:10,305
Thank you, thank you!

22
00:01:10,305 --> 00:01:11,156
You deserve them.

23
00:01:11,156 --> 00:01:12,529
Working side by side for three years,

24
00:01:12,529 --> 00:01:14,787
one can't help but become close friends.

25
00:01:14,787 --> 00:01:15,808
And they're blue!

26
00:01:15,808 --> 00:01:23,546
To match your... lips when they're cold!

27
00:01:23,546 --> 00:01:26,964
Oh, Mum, it's not that I don't want to come home.

28
00:01:26,964 --> 00:01:28,450
I'd love a visit!

29
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:30,283
It's just that I can't!

30
00:01:30,283 --> 00:01:31,649
He won't let me.

31
00:01:31,649 --> 00:01:35,297
Oh, you have no idea what Dr. Crane is like.

32
00:01:35,297 --> 00:01:42,573
Why, he's an absolute beast 
unpleasant to be around, a real tyrant!

33
00:01:42,573 --> 00:01:42,864
Oh!

34
00:01:42,864 --> 00:01:43,752
It's just my mum.

35
00:01:43,752 --> 00:01:45,442
I'm trying to get out of a visit home.

36
00:01:45,442 --> 00:01:47,314
Oh, I understand.

37
00:01:47,314 --> 00:01:48,545
All right.

38
00:01:48,545 --> 00:01:51,065
No, I'm not exaggerating!

39
00:01:51,065 --> 00:01:52,760
He treats me like a bloody slave!

40
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:57,984
Daphne!  Where's my dressing gown?!

41
00:01:57,984 --> 00:01:59,632
Not to mention how cheap he is!

44
00:02:04,528 --> 00:02:10,337
He does sound a lot like Aunt Lillian.

45
00:02:10,337 --> 00:02:12,148
I got to run, Mum.

46
00:02:12,148 --> 00:02:13,351
Love you, bye.

47
00:02:13,351 --> 00:02:15,696
I'm sorry, you must think 
I'm a terrible daughter.

48
00:02:15,696 --> 00:02:16,282
No, not at all.

49
00:02:16,282 --> 00:02:18,118
I think you're a terrible liar, Daphne,

50
00:02:18,118 --> 00:02:20,891
but a perfectly run-of-the-mill daughter.

51
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:23,138
It's just that I only get one vacation a year,

52
00:02:23,138 --> 00:02:25,931
and I want to go somewhere fun, like Acapulco.

53
00:02:25,931 --> 00:02:27,706
Well, that makes sense.

54
00:02:27,706 --> 00:02:30,247
And going home is just so flipping boring.

55
00:02:30,247 --> 00:02:31,931
It's always the same.

56
00:02:31,931 --> 00:02:35,146
There's a wonderful reunion at the airport,

57
00:02:35,146 --> 00:02:38,347
and we share all our news on the way home in the car.

58
00:02:38,347 --> 00:02:40,191
And by the time I've dropped off my suitcase,

59
00:02:40,191 --> 00:02:42,877
we've exhausted all conversation,

60
00:02:42,877 --> 00:02:46,386
and that's when I realize I've got 
a whole week left with nothing

61
00:02:46,386 --> 00:02:48,285
to look forward to but Dad telling

62
00:02:48,285 --> 00:02:51,718
the story of how he once shared 
a cigar with Winston Churchill

63
00:02:51,718 --> 00:02:56,069
during the blackouts ?he thinks!

64
00:02:56,069 --> 00:02:58,430
Well, it sounds like an easy decision, Daphne ?

65
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:01,139
Hasta luego.

66
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:05,668
Oh, Dr. Crane, why is it so easy 
to love our families,

67
00:03:05,668 --> 00:03:08,171
yet so hard to like them?

68
00:03:08,171 --> 00:03:10,167
Well, Daphne, that is one of those questions

69
00:03:10,167 --> 00:03:16,798
that make life so rich... 
and psychiatrists richer.

70
00:03:16,798 --> 00:03:19,578
Yeah, well, maybe I'll just go call a travel agent,

71
00:03:19,578 --> 00:03:28,908
see which guilt trip is more expensive.

72
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:31,187
Good afternoon, Seattle.

73
00:03:31,187 --> 00:03:35,116
My name is Dr. Frasier Crane.

74
00:03:35,116 --> 00:03:38,485
If you can feel, I can heal.

75
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:39,846
Fasten your seat belt, Eddie.

76
00:03:39,846 --> 00:04:33,912
It's going to be a bumpy ride.

77
00:04:33,912 --> 00:04:35,178
Hello.

78
00:04:35,178 --> 00:04:39,329
You're on the air with Dr. Frasier Crane.

79
00:04:39,329 --> 00:05:03,234
"Put your head in my hands."

80
00:05:03,234 --> 00:05:05,473
"Little owlet in the glen, I am ashamed of you,

81
00:05:05,473 --> 00:05:07,227
You are ungrammatical in speaking as you do,

82
00:05:07,227 --> 00:05:09,697
You should say, 'to whom, 
to whom,' not 'to who, to who.'

83
00:05:09,697 --> 00:05:12,360
Your little friend, Miss Katydid, 
may be green, 'tis true,

84
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,594
But you never heard her say?

85
00:05:13,594 --> 00:05:16,241
Who the hell are you?

86
00:05:16,241 --> 00:05:17,737
I'm Roz Doyle, your new producer.

87
00:05:17,737 --> 00:05:18,667
What?  Producer?

88
00:05:18,667 --> 00:05:19,712
Dr. Crane, I presume?

89
00:05:19,712 --> 00:05:20,681
Yes, yes, but, uh, where's Dave?

90
00:05:20,681 --> 00:05:21,692
Uh, he got another assignment.

91
00:05:21,692 --> 00:05:25,385
But I was comfortable with Dave.

92
00:05:25,385 --> 00:05:27,378
Look, Dr. Crane, I know you've 
been thrown a curve,

93
00:05:27,378 --> 00:05:28,538
but everything's gonna be fine.

94
00:05:28,538 --> 00:05:29,920
But I did a mock show with Dave.

95
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,811
I did mock-call-in's, mock commercials, 
mock news bulletins!

96
00:05:32,811 --> 00:05:36,378
Look, I got a bulletin for you: Dave's out, I'm in,

97
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:39,058
and stop saying "mock."

98
00:05:39,058 --> 00:05:40,257
All right, look, Miss Doyle,

99
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:41,793
I'm sure you're quite capable,

100
00:05:41,793 --> 00:05:43,328
but Dave has fifteen years of experience.

101
00:05:43,328 --> 00:05:45,334
I'd really prefer that he do it.

102
00:05:45,334 --> 00:05:47,714
Well, that would make two of us then, wouldn't it?

103
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:52,136
I really think I should call 
management and ask for Dave,

104
00:05:52,136 --> 00:05:54,990
it's not really fair to Dave or to me.

105
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:59,227
Dr. Crane, Dave dumped you.

106
00:05:59,227 --> 00:06:06,537
Why?

107
00:06:06,537 --> 00:06:08,734
We were here until 2 A.M. this morning,

108
00:06:08,734 --> 00:06:11,838
as I explained to Dave in meticulous
detail my philosophy of

109
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:13,623
optimal mental health!

110
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:17,184
It's a mystery, all right.

111
00:06:17,184 --> 00:06:19,046
O.K., look, I'm going to screen a few calls, and

112
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:21,132
No!  No, no, as I explained to Dave before,

113
00:06:21,132 --> 00:06:22,063
there will be no call-screening.

114
00:06:22,063 --> 00:06:24,195
You see, I want my show to be 
fresh and spontaneous,

115
00:06:24,195 --> 00:06:25,892
and call screening squelches all of that.

116
00:06:25,892 --> 00:06:29,933
And the mystery of Dave's departure deepens.

117
00:06:29,933 --> 00:06:44,918
OK, you're on in five seconds, I'll give you a cue.

118
00:06:44,918 --> 00:06:48,519
Good afternoon, Seattle.

119
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:53,120
My name is Dr. Frasier Crane.

120
00:06:53,120 --> 00:07:02,689
"If you can feel, I can heal."

121
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:04,726
Let's see who's on line one!

122
00:07:04,726 --> 00:07:06,969
Hello, this is Dr. Frasier Crane.

123
00:07:06,969 --> 00:07:09,991
"You're on the couch."

124
00:07:09,991 --> 00:07:12,096
No, I'm not.

125
00:07:12,096 --> 00:07:14,600
Well, I meant on the metaphorical couch.

126
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,989
I'm in a beanbag chair, O.K.?

127
00:07:18,989 --> 00:07:23,596
Uh, moving on then, um, how can I help you?

128
00:07:23,596 --> 00:07:25,364
It's about my husband...

129
00:07:25,364 --> 00:07:28,393
Look, I-I just can't do this, it's 
really too embarrassing for me.

130
00:07:28,393 --> 00:07:29,933
No, no, please, please, dear friend,

131
00:07:29,933 --> 00:07:31,735
you must - I'm really here to help you.

132
00:07:31,735 --> 00:07:46,549
Please, go ahead.

133
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:47,788
...I've tried, and I've tried,

134
00:07:47,788 --> 00:07:51,861
and I just don't know what to do about this!

135
00:07:51,861 --> 00:07:53,581
Well, you know, often in these cases,

136
00:07:53,581 --> 00:07:55,980
it helps if you restate your problem.

137
00:07:55,980 --> 00:08:00,103
But this time, try boiling it down 
to one succinct sentence.

138
00:08:00,103 --> 00:08:01,740
Now, how would you do that?

139
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:06,174
My husband is dead!

140
00:08:06,174 --> 00:08:11,640
Well, perhaps we should go back 
to the wordy version.

141
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:17,021
Uh, we'll be right back after 
these Important messages.

142
00:08:17,021 --> 00:08:19,429
Of course I could do a gardening show.

143
00:08:19,429 --> 00:08:21,479
If I can grow plants in my dorm room closet,

144
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:26,380
I must know a thing or two about horticulture?

145
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,660
Are you trying to get transferred?

146
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:29,726
Bye!

147
00:08:29,726 --> 00:08:32,773
Look, Dr. Crane, I got to be honest with you here.

148
00:08:32,773 --> 00:08:37,074
It's just that I-I think psychiatry is, just, uh,

149
00:08:37,074 --> 00:08:40,700
sort of - kind of... bull!

150
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,676
Oh, well, this is a match made 
in heaven then, isn't it?!

151
00:08:42,676 --> 00:08:43,719
Oh, don't be offended.

152
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:44,709
"Don't be offended."

153
00:08:44,709 --> 00:08:46,036
Why should I be offended?

154
00:08:46,036 --> 00:08:48,391
In the last week, I've uprooted 
myself from my home of fifteen years,

155
00:08:48,391 --> 00:08:50,313
moved all the way across the 
country away from everything

156
00:08:50,313 --> 00:08:53,856
I care about, and plunged myself 
into a frightening new career!

157
00:08:53,856 --> 00:08:56,040
The first few nerve-wracking moments, I walk in

158
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,275
here and find my producer lobbying to get herself

159
00:08:58,275 --> 00:09:00,192
transferred to another show!

160
00:09:00,192 --> 00:09:02,264
Abe Lincoln had a brighter future

161
00:09:02,264 --> 00:09:21,138
when he picked up his tickets at the box office!

162
00:09:21,138 --> 00:09:23,088
O.K., you got to make the caller get to the point,

163
00:09:23,088 --> 00:09:25,545
and then for God's sake, so should you.

164
00:09:25,545 --> 00:09:28,310
Duly noted.

165
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:32,144
O.K.  Number twenty-four...

166
00:09:32,144 --> 00:09:32,784
You know what,

167
00:09:32,784 --> 00:09:34,609
you're starting to glaze.

168
00:09:34,609 --> 00:09:37,010
We can go through the rest of this tomorrow.

169
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:37,770
See you, Frasier.

170
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:41,648
Bye, Roz.

171
00:09:41,648 --> 00:09:42,328
Oh, excuse me.

172
00:09:42,328 --> 00:09:45,528
Well, excuse you.

173
00:09:45,528 --> 00:09:47,562
Oh, Niles!

174
00:09:47,562 --> 00:09:48,821
Oh, Frasier!

175
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:49,923
What a serendipitous event.

176
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:51,913
How did you discover my favorite coffee bar?

177
00:09:51,913 --> 00:09:53,922
Well, the radio station's right across the street.

178
00:09:53,922 --> 00:09:55,672
I did my first show today.

179
00:09:55,672 --> 00:09:57,705
Yes, you did, didn't you?

180
00:09:57,705 --> 00:10:05,032
Well... good to see you, have a nice day!

181
00:10:05,032 --> 00:10:07,127
Niles, aren't you going to join me?

182
00:10:07,127 --> 00:10:10,662
Oh, well, I would, but I have a routine.

183
00:10:10,662 --> 00:10:12,174
I come in every day, order coffee

184
00:10:12,174 --> 00:10:16,694
and spend some quality time... 
with myself, you understand.

185
00:10:16,694 --> 00:10:21,473
Niles, I've seen you once in the last two years.

186
00:10:21,473 --> 00:10:24,792
Oh, that is your point.

187
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:26,936
Well... very well, in the spirit of

188
00:10:26,936 --> 00:10:40,437
blood being thicker than water, why don't we?

189
00:10:40,437 --> 00:10:41,913
I remember your fourth birthday party.

190
00:10:41,913 --> 00:10:46,360
Grandmother took us to the park 
to ride the carousel,

191
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,815
and made all those little children

192
00:10:47,815 --> 00:10:51,916
wait while you wiped off your painted pony.

193
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:53,167
I was wearing Bermuda shorts and

194
00:10:53,167 --> 00:11:01,469
that saddle was slick with toddler sweat.

195
00:11:01,469 --> 00:11:04,893
Well, uh... oh, uh, thanks again for

196
00:11:04,893 --> 00:11:09,149
dinner the other night with Maris.

197
00:11:09,149 --> 00:11:10,480
You two seem very happy.

198
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,351
Oh yes, it's love.

199
00:11:12,351 --> 00:11:17,726
Like the Arctic Puffin, we've mated for life.

200
00:11:17,726 --> 00:11:21,053
Honestly, I can't imagine even 
looking at another woman.

201
00:11:21,053 --> 00:11:31,830
Excuse me, sir, have you finished with that sugar?

202
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:32,645
Oh, yes.You ready to order?

203
00:11:32,645 --> 00:11:33,126
Uh, yes.

204
00:11:33,126 --> 00:11:34,987
Double decaf non-fat latte,

205
00:11:34,987 --> 00:11:37,085
mmm... medium foam,

206
00:11:37,085 --> 00:11:41,005
dusted with just the faintest whisper of cinnamon.

207
00:11:41,005 --> 00:11:45,235
I'll have a black coffee.

208
00:11:45,235 --> 00:11:46,324
You'll have to forgive my brother.

209
00:11:46,324 --> 00:11:50,628
He just came in on the noon stage.

210
00:11:50,628 --> 00:11:54,472
I hope I never see the day when 
I am so frightfully pretentious

211
00:11:54,472 --> 00:12:04,283
that a good-old cup of American 
coffee isn't good enough for me.

212
00:12:04,283 --> 00:12:08,174
So, how'd your visit with Dad go?

213
00:12:08,174 --> 00:12:10,152
I haven't been to see him yet.

214
00:12:10,152 --> 00:12:11,419
Really?

215
00:12:11,419 --> 00:12:12,375
You've been in town a whole week.

216
00:12:12,375 --> 00:12:13,642
Well, I've been very busy,

217
00:12:13,642 --> 00:12:16,279
what with settling into the 
new apartment, unpacking...

218
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:17,686
Frasier, you're obviously making excuses.

219
00:12:17,686 --> 00:12:19,424
I'm going over tonight for my weekly visit,

220
00:12:19,424 --> 00:12:22,170
why don't you come along?

221
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:24,034
Geez, I know I should, Niles.

222
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:25,487
But I'm really in such a vulnerable state right now.

223
00:12:25,487 --> 00:12:30,393
The last thing I need is Seattle's 
reigning sourpuss taking potshots at me.

224
00:12:30,393 --> 00:12:31,938
Is that what you're worried about?

225
00:12:31,938 --> 00:12:32,755
Yes!

226
00:12:32,755 --> 00:12:34,559
Well, you have been out of touch.

227
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:36,144
Our father's a changed man.

228
00:12:36,144 --> 00:12:40,514
Ever since he was shot, he's softened,
with a whole new zest for life!

229
00:12:40,514 --> 00:12:42,362
Niles, I visited him in the hospital.

230
00:12:42,362 --> 00:12:47,146
He made his roommate cry, and the man was in a coma.

231
00:12:47,146 --> 00:12:48,241
Dad was still in shock.

232
00:12:48,241 --> 00:12:49,775
The change came after.

233
00:12:49,775 --> 00:12:51,310
As a psychiatrist surely you've seen this?

234
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:54,281
A patient has a brush with death and 
rediscovers his love of life.

235
00:12:54,281 --> 00:12:56,886
Ah,

236
00:12:56,886 --> 00:12:59,100
the laughs we've had when I'm over there.

237
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:03,603
I sometimes wonder if that bullet 
didn't crease his funny bone.

238
00:13:03,603 --> 00:13:06,883
Oh... thank you.

239
00:13:06,883 --> 00:13:09,289
Can you believe the incompetence of that man?

240
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:11,240
I very clearly asked for a whisper of cinnamon,

241
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:14,697
he's given me a full-throated shout!

242
00:13:14,697 --> 00:13:24,329
There are countries in this world 
where they would lop off his sprinkling hand!

243
00:13:24,329 --> 00:13:32,812
You know, I'd forgotten what a weird 
little person you are.

244
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:35,248
Dad is going to be positively giddy 
when he sees that he's got

245
00:13:35,248 --> 00:13:39,080
the both of us tonight.

246
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,176
Who is it?

247
00:13:40,176 --> 00:13:42,339
Niles, and a special guest!

248
00:13:42,339 --> 00:13:46,537
Oh, jeez... all right,

249
00:13:46,537 --> 00:13:47,530
hold your horses.

250
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:51,370
How does he come up with those?

251
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:53,145
Look, Dad, it's Frasier!

252
00:13:53,145 --> 00:13:54,036
Well, I can see that.

253
00:13:54,036 --> 00:13:55,833
That punk didn't shoot out my eyeball.

254
00:13:55,833 --> 00:14:00,321
Stop it!

255
00:14:00,321 --> 00:14:02,820
He sees the humor in everything.

256
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,673
Frasier, come on in.

257
00:14:04,673 --> 00:14:10,697
Thanks, Dad.

258
00:14:10,697 --> 00:14:11,938
So, big game?

259
00:14:11,938 --> 00:14:13,411
Nah, they're losing again.

260
00:14:13,411 --> 00:14:14,372
Pitcher's a bum.

261
00:14:14,372 --> 00:14:21,279
He's a bum, he's an absolute hobo!

262
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,575
Isn't that right, Skipper?

263
00:14:23,575 --> 00:14:26,840
Niles, are you drunk?

264
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,931
Don't be ridiculous!

265
00:14:27,931 --> 00:14:30,936
Seeing the three of us back together
again in the same room

266
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:31,819
who needs alcohol for that?

267
00:14:31,819 --> 00:14:32,281
I do.

268
00:14:32,281 --> 00:14:34,799
I do.

269
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:36,542
I'll get you a beer.

270
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:41,935
Thanks, Dad.

271
00:14:41,935 --> 00:14:43,321
You filthy liar!

272
00:14:43,321 --> 00:14:44,514
You said he'd changed!

273
00:14:44,514 --> 00:14:47,226
Well, it got you here, didn't it?

274
00:14:47,226 --> 00:14:49,666
I've been dealing with him all by 
myself ever since Mom died.

275
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:53,720
Now it's your turn, so welcome home, prodigal son!

276
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,958
You guys want some pork rinds?

277
00:14:55,958 --> 00:15:00,841
And that's as close as you're going
to get to a fatted calf.

278
00:15:00,841 --> 00:15:03,919
No, thanks, Dad.

279
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:06,830
Oh, will you stop staring at me?

280
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:07,586
Here you go.

281
00:15:07,586 --> 00:15:09,759
Ah, well, I understand completely, Frasier.

282
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:12,394
Dad, Frasier was just saying that he'd
like to spend some quality time with

283
00:15:12,394 --> 00:15:14,223
you alone, so I'm just going to slip out.

284
00:15:14,223 --> 00:15:15,279
All right, suit yourself.

285
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:19,913
All right... oh, you haven't met Eddie.

286
00:15:19,913 --> 00:15:31,277
Eddie?  Frasier is the firstborn.

287
00:15:31,277 --> 00:15:40,279
The torch has been passed.

288
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:42,175
So...

289
00:15:42,175 --> 00:15:44,644
How was your flight?

290
00:15:44,644 --> 00:15:54,320
Oh, actually, I drove.

291
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,782
You take the I-Ninety?

292
00:15:56,782 --> 00:15:59,360
Uh, Eighty.

293
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,055
Should have taken Ninety, it would
have got you here faster.

294
00:16:03,055 --> 00:16:13,444
Darn.  So, Dad, did you listen to my show today?

295
00:16:13,444 --> 00:16:14,358
No, I missed it.

296
00:16:14,358 --> 00:16:15,782
Sorry.

297
00:16:15,782 --> 00:16:17,407
That's all right.

298
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:18,685
How'd it go?

299
00:16:18,685 --> 00:16:22,023
Well, uh, kind of rocky.

300
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:25,766
Spent a good part of the day puzzling
over the proper signature line

301
00:16:25,766 --> 00:16:27,629
to use to introduce myself.

302
00:16:27,629 --> 00:16:29,022
Well, I'm sure you'll come up with something.

303
00:16:29,022 --> 00:16:30,622
Well, you know, I'm looking for 
something that's familiar

304
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:33,182
but not a clich you know, 
something that's memorable

305
00:16:33,182 --> 00:16:36,148
but not too gimmicky...

306
00:16:36,148 --> 00:16:39,222
You know, it doesn't really matter 
if it's got something

307
00:16:39,222 --> 00:16:42,613
to ad, please, I'm trying to have 
a conversation, it's hard with the TV on.

308
00:16:42,613 --> 00:16:44,890
Well, I just want to get the score, O.K.?

309
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:48,681
I'm trying to describe to you my 
dilemna with that phrase?

310
00:16:48,681 --> 00:16:50,138
All right, fine, I'm listening.

311
00:16:50,138 --> 00:16:52,384
Are you happy?  I'm listening.

312
00:16:52,384 --> 00:16:52,833
That's it!

313
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:53,320
"I'm listening!"

314
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,226
That's fabulous!

315
00:16:54,226 --> 00:16:55,363
Have you got a pencil somewhere?

316
00:16:55,363 --> 00:16:58,652
Yeah, there's one in the kitchen on the table.

317
00:16:58,652 --> 00:17:02,564
"I'm listening."  Dad - oh, I love that!

318
00:17:02,564 --> 00:17:05,498
Uh, look, I hate to cut this short, 
but I told some guys

319
00:17:05,498 --> 00:17:08,752
I'd meet 'em down at Duke's.

320
00:17:08,752 --> 00:17:09,664
You're leaving?

321
00:17:09,664 --> 00:17:10,121
Yeah.

322
00:17:10,121 --> 00:17:12,242
Whenever you're ready, I'll walk you out.

323
00:17:12,242 --> 00:17:13,537
Dad, I haven't seen you in two years,

324
00:17:13,537 --> 00:17:16,681
I stopped by and you're leaving in ten minutes?

325
00:17:16,681 --> 00:17:19,146
Oh, why don't we stop kidding ourselves?

326
00:17:19,146 --> 00:17:20,362
You don't really want to be here,

327
00:17:20,362 --> 00:17:24,387
and we don't really have anything to talk about.

328
00:17:24,387 --> 00:17:25,536
At least I'm making the effort.

329
00:17:25,536 --> 00:17:29,186
Oh, yeah ?it's an effort to talk to me, huh?

330
00:17:29,186 --> 00:17:32,601
Well, I guess that's why you only bother
coming home once a year at Christmas.

331
00:17:32,601 --> 00:17:35,138
Oh no, wait!  Sorry, I take that back.

332
00:17:35,138 --> 00:17:40,552
Last year you went to Arugalah, 
wherever the hell that is.

333
00:17:40,552 --> 00:17:42,539
Dad, you know you're painting an 
awfully bleak picture here.

334
00:17:42,539 --> 00:17:44,210
Ever since I moved to Boston, I've 
come home at least three

335
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:46,240
or four times a year.

336
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,577
It's just lately things got a little hectic,

337
00:17:48,577 --> 00:17:49,936
and I haven't been able to come home as often.

338
00:17:49,936 --> 00:17:58,847
Yeah... I noticed how busy you got 
after your mother died.

339
00:17:58,847 --> 00:18:02,543
But, what the hell, I didn't go visit
you in Boston either, did I?

340
00:18:02,543 --> 00:18:07,568
So, uh, why don't we just drop this?

341
00:18:07,568 --> 00:18:15,048
No.  The point is that we're here now, together.

342
00:18:15,048 --> 00:18:19,759
I don't want this night to end before 
we've at least tried to have

343
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:22,496
one real conversation.

344
00:18:22,496 --> 00:18:23,387
Will you at least try, Dad?

345
00:18:23,387 --> 00:18:55,721
Will you just sit down with me for 
a while and let's try, please?

346
00:18:55,721 --> 00:19:06,264
So, uh, you know, I'd forgotten how 
much it really does rain here.

347
00:19:06,264 --> 00:19:10,640
You get used to it.

348
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,730
Makes things green.

349
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:44,974
Yeah... where would the old earth be without rain?

350
00:19:44,974 --> 00:19:55,741
My darling, I would have thought that 
old fascination would wear off by now.

351
00:19:55,741 --> 00:19:56,686
Well, hello, there!

352
00:19:56,686 --> 00:19:57,300
Hey!

353
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,052
Oh, hey, guys.

354
00:19:58,052 --> 00:20:01,271
Frasier, Dad tells me you've been on 
the air three years today,

355
00:20:01,271 --> 00:20:03,467
so we'd like to take you out for a celebratory dinner.

356
00:20:03,467 --> 00:20:06,261
Well, thank you.  Dad, how did you know?

357
00:20:06,261 --> 00:20:09,301
Well, I heard that woman who called in.

358
00:20:09,301 --> 00:20:11,259
You listened to my show?

359
00:20:11,259 --> 00:20:13,391
Well, I sort of...

360
00:20:13,391 --> 00:20:16,309
I feel asleep during the Mariners' game...

361
00:20:16,309 --> 00:20:17,876
but when I woke up, you were on.

362
00:20:17,876 --> 00:20:19,187
And you didn't turn me off.

363
00:20:19,187 --> 00:20:21,507
I did not!

364
00:20:21,507 --> 00:20:23,181
I listened to you for ten minutes before

365
00:20:23,181 --> 00:20:27,310
I finally dozed off again.

366
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:30,418
Faint praise, and yet it thunders in my ears!

367
00:20:30,418 --> 00:20:30,974
Hello, Dr. Crane.

368
00:20:30,974 --> 00:20:33,256
Hey, Daphne, we're going out to dinner.

369
00:20:33,256 --> 00:20:34,585
You want to join us?

370
00:20:34,585 --> 00:20:35,704
Oh, thanks, but no.

371
00:20:35,704 --> 00:20:39,103
I promised myself that tonight I'd decide  
what I'm doing on my vacation ?

372
00:20:39,103 --> 00:20:42,073
either home to the family or to sunny Acapulco.

373
00:20:42,073 --> 00:20:51,512
I may just squeeze into my bikini and 
let my hips make the decision.

374
00:20:51,512 --> 00:20:53,503
Of course, it would be more memorable 
if we celebrated at home, just for a?

375
00:20:53,503 --> 00:20:56,609
Let's go, let's go!

376
00:20:56,609 --> 00:20:58,641
Have a lovely time!

377
00:20:58,641 --> 00:20:59,745
Oh, fellas, hold the elevator for me.

378
00:20:59,745 --> 00:21:01,136
All right.

379
00:21:01,136 --> 00:21:02,592
Daphne?

380
00:21:02,592 --> 00:21:05,762
I was just thinking about our 
discussion earlier this afternoon,

381
00:21:05,762 --> 00:21:09,792
and I've decided to give you an extra week off.

382
00:21:09,792 --> 00:21:13,176
That way you can go to Manchester, and Acapulco.

383
00:21:13,176 --> 00:21:16,113
Oh, that's so sweet!

384
00:21:16,113 --> 00:21:18,638
You really must think I should go home.

385
00:21:18,638 --> 00:21:27,813
Well, I've just realized that being 
part of a family is really worth the effort.

386
00:21:27,813 --> 00:21:38,582
And very often the effort... means 
you'll need a week in Acapulco, so...

387
00:21:38,582 --> 00:21:39,711
Thank you, Dr. Crane.

388
00:21:39,711 --> 00:21:43,246
You're welcome.

389
00:21:43,246 --> 00:21:47,115
I guess if I try a little harder, it won't be so bad.

390
00:21:47,115 --> 00:21:49,813
Well, that's a good way of thinking.

391
00:21:49,813 --> 00:21:53,070
You know, things can get better.

392
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:54,196
Hey, let's go!

393
00:21:54,196 --> 00:22:01,239
I got acid burning a hole in my stomach!

394
00:22:01,239 --> 00:22:11,419
Still... would you mind leaving 
those brochures of Acapulco out for me?

395
00:22:11,419 --> 00:22:12,394
THANKS FOR CALLING
