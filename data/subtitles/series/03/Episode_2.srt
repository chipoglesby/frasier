1
00:00:10,012 --> 00:00:16,410
Well, it's uh... 2:07,
here on the Dr. Frasier Crane Show.

2
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:20,240
As I said, I'm Roz Doyle, Frasier's producer,

3
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,467
filling in for the temporarily detained Dr. Crane.

4
00:00:25,467 --> 00:00:35,658
It's cloudy and 62 degrees outside
coming up on 2:08... right... there.

5
00:00:35,658 --> 00:00:39,473
Well, let's take a call.

6
00:00:39,473 --> 00:00:42,329
Hello, Lydia.  What seems to be the problem?

7
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:43,352
I already told you.

8
00:00:43,352 --> 00:00:47,634
Yeah, that was when I was the call screener,
now I'm the host.

9
00:00:47,634 --> 00:00:50,352
So, tell me your problem, and take your time.

10
00:00:50,352 --> 00:00:53,129
Well, it started about two weeks ago.

11
00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:55,275
I got this terrible obscene phone call.

12
00:00:55,275 --> 00:00:58,081
It's happened several times since then
and now it's to the point

13
00:00:58,081 --> 00:00:59,936
where I'm afraid to answer my own phone.

14
00:00:59,936 --> 00:01:02,064
Well, obscene phone calls can be very disturbing.

15
00:01:02,064 --> 00:01:03,866
But luckily, Dr. Frasier Crane has
just arrived and

16
00:01:03,866 --> 00:01:14,032
I'm sure he knows exactly
what soothing things to say.

17
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:15,895
Maybe now would be a good time to take a break.

18
00:01:15,895 --> 00:01:18,066
We'll be right back after this.

19
00:01:18,066 --> 00:01:19,195
What the hell was that all about?!

20
00:01:19,195 --> 00:01:21,608
Oh, never mind that, where were you?

21
00:01:21,608 --> 00:01:23,983
Oh, god.  Somebody'd parked in my space again.

22
00:01:23,983 --> 00:01:27,488
I had to park six blocks from here
and sprint the whole way.

23
00:01:27,488 --> 00:01:30,163
By the end, my tweed pants were
	hrowing off so many sparks

24
00:01:30,163 --> 00:01:34,224
I almost caught myself on fire!

25
00:01:34,224 --> 00:01:36,895
I tell you what - the minute we go to a news break

26
00:01:36,895 --> 00:01:38,511
I'm going to rush down there and

27
00:01:38,511 --> 00:01:42,081
put this withering note on his windshield.

28
00:01:42,081 --> 00:01:45,881
Dear discourteous driver...?

29
00:01:45,881 --> 00:01:49,191
Whoa!  I think you've said enough right there!

30
00:01:49,191 --> 00:01:50,254
Come on, Frasier.

31
00:01:50,254 --> 00:01:52,008
This isn't gonna do any good!

32
00:01:52,008 --> 00:01:53,199
You want to make an impression on him?

33
00:01:53,199 --> 00:01:54,905
Get tough.  You go right down there

34
00:01:54,905 --> 00:01:56,751
and let the air out of his tires.

35
00:01:56,751 --> 00:01:58,279
Oh, I wouldn't do something like that.

36
00:01:58,279 --> 00:02:02,090
Why?  It's just inconveniencing him
like he inconvenienced you.

37
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:04,025
Roz, listen, the world has become uncivilized enough

38
00:02:04,025 --> 00:02:05,898
without me stooping to that level.

39
00:02:05,898 --> 00:02:08,772
Of course I was sorely tempted last night.

40
00:02:08,772 --> 00:02:11,836
I went to the movies to see
"How Green Was My Valley."

41
00:02:11,836 --> 00:02:14,676
Lady Luck seated me in front of two
elderly women who said with the arrival of each

44
00:02:22,656 --> 00:02:29,372
Oh, you're on in five seconds.
And Brenda is on line one.

45
00:02:29,372 --> 00:02:31,538
Hello, Seattle.  We're back, and
I would like to start by

46
00:02:31,538 --> 00:02:34,212
apologizing for being tardy.

47
00:02:34,212 --> 00:02:38,161
Nothing quite so inconsiderate as
making someone wait.

48
00:02:38,161 --> 00:02:40,979
Now without further ado let's get to Brenda.

49
00:02:40,979 --> 00:02:42,524
Hello, Brenda.

50
00:02:42,524 --> 00:02:46,522
Hi, Dr. Crane. I'm having a problem with my sister.

51
00:02:46,522 --> 00:02:48,920
She's always... Oh, wait a second.

52
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:55,163
That's my other line.

53
00:02:55,163 --> 00:03:00,000
Something tells me I'm going to be siding with Brenda's sister.

54
00:03:14,123 --> 00:03:23,716
You're welcome!

55
00:03:23,716 --> 00:03:27,145
Excuse me, I was wondering
if you could direct me to...

56
00:03:27,145 --> 00:03:29,618
Friendly Video.

57
00:03:29,618 --> 00:03:31,841
Yeah, I think we got that one.

58
00:03:31,841 --> 00:03:34,000
Hang on a second, I'll check.

59
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,586
Don't you hate that?

60
00:03:35,586 --> 00:03:37,648
You come all the way down here yourself to the store,

61
00:03:37,648 --> 00:03:42,018
wait patiently, and somebody who calls
in from home gets preferential treatment.

62
00:03:42,018 --> 00:03:47,649
I can help the next person in line.

63
00:03:47,649 --> 00:03:49,371
Hey, do we have "The Invisible Man?"

64
00:03:49,371 --> 00:03:53,810
Right here!

65
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:56,064
Thanks.Yeah, we got it.

66
00:03:56,064 --> 00:04:00,609
Excuse me. I was looking for...

67
00:04:00,609 --> 00:04:05,458
Don't even think about it!

68
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:07,775
I'm looking for "How Green Was My Valley."

69
00:04:07,775 --> 00:04:09,913
Huh?

70
00:04:09,913 --> 00:04:14,672
It is a beautifully acted depiction
of life in a small town in Wales.

71
00:04:14,672 --> 00:04:17,249
It won five Academy Awards!  It's a classic!

72
00:04:17,249 --> 00:04:19,751
Oh. Well, uh, this is a shot in the dark,

73
00:04:19,751 --> 00:04:26,566
but you might try looking in the Classics section.

74
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:28,646
Uh... you're taking "How Green Was My Valley?"

75
00:04:28,646 --> 00:04:29,552
I heard it was great.

76
00:04:29,552 --> 00:04:30,719
Yes, but you heard it from me!

77
00:04:30,719 --> 00:04:36,250
You were standing next to me in the line!

78
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,358
Excuse me, is there another copy?

79
00:04:38,358 --> 00:04:43,740
Oh yeah, that would be across the street
in our "How Green Was My Valley" annex.

80
00:04:54,504 --> 00:04:56,024
Hey Daphne. Come on, you're just in time.

81
00:04:56,024 --> 00:04:57,759
It's starting.

82
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,480
I don't get this show.

83
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,749
People send in videos of themselves having

84
00:05:01,749 --> 00:05:04,320
the most embarrassing and painful accidents.

85
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,953
They add cartoon noises and music and
everyone laughs themselves silly.

86
00:05:08,953 --> 00:05:17,626
Boy, I bet that hurt!

87
00:05:17,626 --> 00:05:19,178
Well, what's wrong with you?

88
00:05:19,178 --> 00:05:23,773
Frankly, I have had it with the
whole boorish, ill-mannered world.

89
00:05:23,773 --> 00:05:26,652
Look, Dad, would you mind terribly
if I used the TV tonight?

90
00:05:26,652 --> 00:05:28,825
I went to three video stores to get this tape.

91
00:05:28,825 --> 00:05:30,768
I'm just dying to see it.

92
00:05:30,768 --> 00:05:33,592
Sure, go ahead.  How many times can you watch

93
00:05:33,592 --> 00:05:38,536
a dog get hit with a swinging door?

94
00:05:38,536 --> 00:05:50,171
Depends upon the dog.

95
00:05:50,171 --> 00:05:52,772
What the hell is that?!

96
00:05:52,772 --> 00:05:58,763
The windows are rattling, the walls
are shaking, and I am talking to no one!!

97
00:05:58,763 --> 00:06:00,691
Well, I see our neighbor's at it again.

98
00:06:00,691 --> 00:06:02,433
Not for long!

99
00:06:02,433 --> 00:06:03,711
I'm gonna take a nap.

100
00:06:03,711 --> 00:06:05,755
Frasier: Dad, you can't possibly
expect to sleep in this racket.

101
00:06:05,755 --> 00:06:08,031
Are you kidding?  I've slept through worse than this.

102
00:06:08,031 --> 00:06:11,536
In Korea I dropped off in a foxhole
right outside P'Anmunjom.

103
00:06:11,536 --> 00:06:13,499
By the time I woke up the cease-fire was over and

104
00:06:13,499 --> 00:06:15,721
I was the only one who didn't know about it.

105
00:06:15,721 --> 00:06:18,258
Talk about having egg on your face.

106
00:06:18,258 --> 00:06:20,175
Yes.  Yes, would you please connect
me with the young man

107
00:06:20,175 --> 00:06:22,472
who's just moved into the penthouse upstairs.

108
00:06:22,472 --> 00:06:23,570
No, I don't know his name!

109
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:25,378
He's in the penthouse!

110
00:06:25,378 --> 00:06:28,234
He has shaggy hair, tattoos all over him,

111
00:06:28,234 --> 00:06:29,250
his body is pierced.

112
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:39,426
Oh, and I don't know if I mentioned
this but he's in the penthouse!

113
00:06:39,426 --> 00:06:42,088
Never mind.

114
00:06:42,088 --> 00:06:45,423
Has the world completely lost the
concept of common courtesy?

115
00:06:45,423 --> 00:06:48,538
Am I the only one who is resisting this tide?!

116
00:06:48,538 --> 00:06:53,314
People of Seattle, listen to me!

117
00:06:53,314 --> 00:06:55,626
We are not barbarians!

118
00:06:55,626 --> 00:06:59,273
We are not Neanderthals and we are not French!

119
00:06:59,273 --> 00:07:06,384
Do you hear that, you up there?! [

120
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:08,752
That's his own music he's listening to, you know.

121
00:07:08,752 --> 00:07:10,880
His name is Freddie Chainsaw.

122
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:15,807
Chainsaw?  Of the Newport Chainsaws?

123
00:07:15,807 --> 00:07:19,927
How does an arrested adolescent
who barely knows two chords get a penthouse?

124
00:07:19,927 --> 00:07:22,822
His last album sold five million copies.

125
00:07:22,822 --> 00:07:33,078
Oh.  Well, then, I'll just add
that to my list of reasons to die.

126
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:34,696
You know, personally, I like it.

127
00:07:34,696 --> 00:07:38,041
But then, we Brits have always
been on the cutting edge.

128
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:40,584
You should have heard the punk
rockers who rented the flat below me

129
00:07:40,584 --> 00:07:41,710
a few years back.

130
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:45,016
They'd play the same song over and over again

131
00:07:45,016 --> 00:07:51,350
Flesh is burning... nana nana nana.
Flesh is burning... nana nana nana.

132
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:56,110
Oh no.  I'm gonna have that tune in me head all day now.

133
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:57,044
Yes, well, thank you for that, Daphne.

134
00:07:57,044 --> 00:08:12,353
But I've been waiting all day to watch my movie.

135
00:08:12,353 --> 00:08:21,126
Doesn't he ever stop for sex and drugs?!

136
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:23,143
Hello.  Yes.  Please,

137
00:08:23,143 --> 00:08:27,423
I insist on being connected with
the young man in the penthouse.

138
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:31,093
Yes, hello, Mr. Chainsaw?  Yes, how do you do?

139
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:32,942
I'm Dr. Frasier Crane.  I am your neighbor;

140
00:08:32,942 --> 00:08:34,799
I live right below you.

141
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:38,847
Yes, do you have any idea how loud your music is?

142
00:08:38,847 --> 00:08:54,239
Oh.  You do?  Well... thank you.

143
00:08:54,239 --> 00:08:55,366
I'm going out!

144
00:08:55,366 --> 00:08:55,938
What?

145
00:08:55,938 --> 00:08:56,959
I'm going out!

146
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:57,701
What?

147
00:08:57,701 --> 00:08:59,526
I AM GOING OUT!

148
00:08:59,526 --> 00:09:01,143
Hey, Frasier, will you keep it down out there.

149
00:09:01,143 --> 00:09:03,351
I'm trying to take a nap!

150
00:09:11,837 --> 00:09:15,470
Smell me, Niles.

151
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:16,562
Grandpa!

152
00:09:16,562 --> 00:09:19,534
Exactly!  On my way down in the elevator today

153
00:09:19,534 --> 00:09:22,079
a woman thinks nothing of lighting up a cigarette.

154
00:09:22,079 --> 00:09:23,390
Has the world gone mad?

155
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:25,134
I know exactly how you feel.

156
00:09:25,134 --> 00:09:28,174
This morning I discovered a ding
in the door of my car.

157
00:09:28,174 --> 00:09:30,433
Let me guess - no note on the windshield?

158
00:09:30,433 --> 00:09:33,989
No.  And even worse, after I'd left
the car off at the body shop,

159
00:09:33,989 --> 00:09:36,653
the rental agency didn't have a single luxury car left.

160
00:09:36,653 --> 00:09:41,121
They stuck me with some vehicle
I believe they call a Hunchback.

161
00:09:41,121 --> 00:09:44,333
No.  I think that would be a Hatchback, Niles.

162
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:48,000
It's painted panic-button red, with
a large rear window that pops open.

163
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,232
Oh, that would be the Hatchback.

164
00:09:50,232 --> 00:10:00,471
Well, there's a novel idea: name
the car after its most hideous feature.

165
00:10:00,471 --> 00:10:02,399
I presume it was a toss-up between "Hatchback" and

166
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,783
"What's that odor coming from the floor?"

167
00:10:06,783 --> 00:10:10,349
Oh, look, Niles - free table!  Go, go, go, go!

168
00:10:10,349 --> 00:10:11,165
Oh, the biscotti!

169
00:10:11,165 --> 00:10:11,845
Leave it!

170
00:10:11,845 --> 00:10:17,144
Oh, no - go on without me!

171
00:10:17,144 --> 00:10:17,910
Oh, there!

172
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:23,444
Oh!

173
00:10:23,444 --> 00:10:24,835
Oh, check on table one!

174
00:10:24,835 --> 00:10:36,185
All right, fine.

175
00:10:36,185 --> 00:10:38,179
Oh, we're not hovering, believe me.

176
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:42,584
It's just that there... well,
there's really no place else to stand.

177
00:10:42,584 --> 00:10:43,930
Oh, just take your time, please.

178
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:46,387
There's no rush.

179
00:10:46,387 --> 00:10:48,489
Is the owner of a red Hatchback here?

180
00:10:48,489 --> 00:10:50,273
It's about to be towed.

181
00:10:50,273 --> 00:10:51,257
Niles, isn't that your car?

182
00:10:51,257 --> 00:10:54,970
Shh!  Someone will hear you!

183
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:56,729
Niles, it's about to be towed!

184
00:10:56,729 --> 00:10:57,835
I'm not owning up to that car.

185
00:10:57,835 --> 00:11:01,761
I don't care if it's careening
toward a baby carriage!

186
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:03,063
Oh.  Oh, thank you so much.

187
00:11:03,063 --> 00:11:08,137
Take care, have a lovely day.

188
00:11:08,137 --> 00:11:11,119
Excuse me, but we were waiting for this table.

189
00:11:11,119 --> 00:11:14,069
So get another one.

190
00:11:14,069 --> 00:11:15,515
Well, there aren't any.

191
00:11:15,515 --> 00:11:17,195
Look, you knew that we were waiting for it.

192
00:11:17,195 --> 00:11:18,755
We politely stood back and let
those people leave and then

193
00:11:18,755 --> 00:11:20,429
you just jumped right in here!

194
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:24,715
Well, you won't make that mistake again.

195
00:11:24,715 --> 00:11:25,741
Frasier, Frasier... forget it.

196
00:11:25,741 --> 00:11:27,043
We'll just... we'll wait for another table.

197
00:11:27,043 --> 00:11:30,477
No, we won't!  This isn't about the table anymore!

198
00:11:30,477 --> 00:11:33,556
This is about the erosion of common decency.

199
00:11:33,556 --> 00:11:37,074
Sir, when you treat me this way you
encourage me to be discourteous to another.

200
00:11:37,074 --> 00:11:41,002
And so on and so on.

201
00:11:41,002 --> 00:11:45,292
You don't have any manners, do you?

202
00:11:45,292 --> 00:11:56,539
Then perhaps what you need is an etiquette lesson!!

203
00:11:56,539 --> 00:12:00,792
SIT DOWN, NILES!

204
00:12:00,792 --> 00:12:02,635
My brother will have a decaf.

205
00:12:10,044 --> 00:12:15,968
Flesh is burning, nana nana nana...

206
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:23,516
Nana nana nana... flesh is burning... nana nana nana...

207
00:12:23,516 --> 00:12:25,388
Oh, hi, Fras.  How you feeling?

208
00:12:25,388 --> 00:12:27,043
Fine.

209
00:12:27,043 --> 00:12:30,633
I didn't ask you yesterday how your day went.

210
00:12:30,633 --> 00:12:32,123
What did Niles tell you?

211
00:12:32,123 --> 00:12:34,521
Nothing!  Geez, can't I ask you how your day went?

212
00:12:34,521 --> 00:12:36,315
How was work?

213
00:12:36,315 --> 00:12:40,729
How's your bad-ass self?

214
00:12:40,729 --> 00:12:42,682
Dammit!  Niles blabbed!

215
00:12:42,682 --> 00:12:44,316
No, he didn't.

216
00:12:44,316 --> 00:12:45,833
You made the people of Seattle column.

217
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:50,664
Right here, under "The Crane Mutiny."

218
00:12:50,664 --> 00:12:53,811
"Three cheers for Dr. Frasier Crane,
who struck a blow against

219
00:12:53,811 --> 00:12:57,145
rudeness yesterday in a coffeehouse melee."

220
00:12:57,145 --> 00:12:59,017
Perfect!

221
00:12:59,017 --> 00:13:01,339
Now all of Seattle knows about my loutish behavior!

222
00:13:01,339 --> 00:13:02,313
What are you talking about?

223
00:13:02,313 --> 00:13:03,729
This guy had it coming.

224
00:13:03,729 --> 00:13:05,482
I can just picture it.

225
00:13:05,482 --> 00:13:06,798
He probably looked at you and he thought,

226
00:13:06,798 --> 00:13:12,313
"This guy's a creampuff, you know.
A wuss... a wimp... a cupcake..."

227
00:13:12,313 --> 00:13:13,415
Dad!

228
00:13:13,415 --> 00:13:18,505
I'm sorry, I'm just so proud of you!

229
00:13:18,505 --> 00:13:20,777
Ah, there he is, the man who floats like a

230
00:13:20,777 --> 00:13:27,592
lepidoptera and stings like a hymenoptera.

231
00:13:27,592 --> 00:13:29,295
Niles, I think you're just jealous.

232
00:13:29,295 --> 00:13:31,440
Jealous?  Don't be ridiculous!

233
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,830
This is my favorite part.

234
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:35,721
"With one swift move the good doctor hoisted the miscreant

235
00:13:35,721 --> 00:13:37,369
out on his ear, declaring,

236
00:13:37,369 --> 00:13:40,345
'What you need is an etiquette lesson.'"

237
00:13:40,345 --> 00:13:43,995
I love that!  You got your own tough-guy catchphrase!

238
00:13:43,995 --> 00:13:44,912
It's perfect for you, Frasier.

239
00:13:44,912 --> 00:13:49,882
Dirty Harry meets Emily Post.

240
00:13:49,882 --> 00:13:51,788
Come on.  Show me how you grabbed him.  Use Niles.

241
00:13:51,788 --> 00:13:55,657
No, no Dad.  I will not toss Niles about the room.

242
00:13:55,657 --> 00:14:02,368
Oh no, go ahead.  Rough me up,
Mr. Big Hero Bully Bouncer!

243
00:14:02,368 --> 00:14:03,697
Did that sound jealous?

244
00:14:03,697 --> 00:14:04,554
A tad.

245
00:14:04,554 --> 00:14:05,496
Well, all right, I'm jealous.

246
00:14:05,496 --> 00:14:08,539
Why shouldn't I be?  All my life
I've backed out of fights

247
00:14:08,539 --> 00:14:10,569
and watching you leap into the fray like that,

248
00:14:10,569 --> 00:14:14,834
I... it made me think just once 
I'd like to experience what you felt -

249
00:14:14,834 --> 00:14:16,263
go nose to nose.

250
00:14:16,263 --> 00:14:17,639
Oh, your day will come, son.

251
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:27,844
I don't know.  I tried it this morning
with my dry cleaner, Mr. Kim.

252
00:14:27,844 --> 00:14:30,719
I decided to give him a good
tongue-lashing because he'd shattered

253
00:14:30,719 --> 00:14:33,855
the mother-of-pearl buttons on my best waistcoat.

254
00:14:33,855 --> 00:14:36,466
Unfortunately, due to his tenuous grasp of English and

255
00:14:36,466 --> 00:14:38,204
the fact that his mother's name is Pearl

256
00:14:38,204 --> 00:14:44,817
I was forced to flee his establishment
amid a shower of coat hangers.

257
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:46,601
Good morning, Dr. Crane.

258
00:14:46,601 --> 00:14:50,289
And to you, Dr. Crane, our very own
knight in shining armor...

259
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:51,506
Oh, great.

260
00:14:51,506 --> 00:14:54,283
I want you to know that your assertiveness inspired me.

261
00:14:54,283 --> 00:14:57,572
For weeks now, some louse has been
removing my wet clothes from

262
00:14:57,572 --> 00:15:00,864
the washer and leaving them on the table in a soggy mess.

263
00:15:00,864 --> 00:15:03,496
This morning, I decided to get my revenge.

264
00:15:03,496 --> 00:15:08,330
So I took off my new red panties and
I popped them in with his whites.

265
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:10,434
Bravo, Daphne.  Good for you.

266
00:15:10,434 --> 00:15:14,754
God, I wish I'd been there.

267
00:15:14,754 --> 00:15:17,072
Daphne, don't you think you were overreacting just a bit?

268
00:15:17,072 --> 00:15:18,305
Absolutely not.

269
00:15:18,305 --> 00:15:22,609
Those were my panties and I wasn't afraid to use them.

270
00:15:22,609 --> 00:15:24,776
Fras, why do you keep backing away from this?

271
00:15:24,776 --> 00:15:26,538
I mean, you should be proud of yourself.

272
00:15:26,538 --> 00:15:28,008
We all think you did the right thing.

273
00:15:28,008 --> 00:15:29,239
The newspaper does too.

274
00:15:29,239 --> 00:15:29,978
That's right.

275
00:15:29,978 --> 00:15:32,702
And I'm going to fix you a proper hero's breakfast.

276
00:15:32,702 --> 00:15:33,583
No.  No, no... Daphne.

277
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:34,521
Please, really.

278
00:15:34,521 --> 00:15:35,578
It's not necessary.

279
00:15:35,578 --> 00:15:36,343
Thank you all.

280
00:15:36,343 --> 00:15:39,979
It's just that this isn't sitting well with me.

281
00:15:39,979 --> 00:15:45,833
I find it hard to believe any good can come of violence.

282
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:52,998
That's it again!

283
00:15:52,998 --> 00:16:07,073
Mr. Chainsaw.  This is Dr. Frasier Crane...

284
00:16:07,073 --> 00:16:11,652
Go ahead, Daphne.  Make my eggs.

285
00:16:24,636 --> 00:16:26,796
You know, I do wish people would stop making such a fuss.

286
00:16:26,796 --> 00:16:32,434
They will, if you quit walking up and down the hall.

287
00:16:32,434 --> 00:16:33,741
You're on in five seconds.

288
00:16:33,741 --> 00:16:40,585
Oh yes, all right.

289
00:16:40,585 --> 00:16:43,117
Hello, this is Dr. Frasier Crane.

290
00:16:43,117 --> 00:16:44,514
Who's on the line, Roz?

291
00:16:44,514 --> 00:16:46,172
We have Mitch on line three.

292
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:49,260
He's having trouble with his neighbors.

293
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:50,243
Hello, Mitch.

294
00:16:50,243 --> 00:16:51,885
Make that had trouble.

295
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:56,132
This idiot next door had his leaf-blower
going at 7:00am, again.

296
00:16:56,132 --> 00:16:57,363
Oh, that's very inconsiderate.

297
00:16:57,363 --> 00:17:01,337
I'll say.  That's why I decided to
give him an "etiquette lesson."

298
00:17:01,337 --> 00:17:07,572
I grabbed that leaf-blower and smashed it against atree.

299
00:17:07,572 --> 00:17:10,346
Mitch, I must say I'm stunned.

300
00:17:10,346 --> 00:17:15,473
I can't imagine amore extreme response
to such a minor infraction.

301
00:17:15,473 --> 00:17:18,989
...so I snuck into his backyard and shoved
a whole pound of rotten shrimp

302
00:17:18,989 --> 00:17:23,000
into his air conditioner!  Come on summer!

303
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:29,352
...hey, he asked for it.  So I put
100 scorpions in a FedEx package.

304
00:17:29,352 --> 00:17:33,153
Look, I'm sorry, but no matter how provoked you may have been,

305
00:17:33,153 --> 00:17:37,958
there is no earthly justification for...
SETTING SOMEONE'S LAWN ON FIRE!!

306
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:39,772
But she doesn't curb her dogs!

307
00:17:39,772 --> 00:17:42,648
Oh...

308
00:17:42,648 --> 00:17:45,813
You don't take any guff.  Why should I?

309
00:17:45,813 --> 00:17:48,686
Rochelle... all of you... look,

310
00:17:48,686 --> 00:17:52,399
don't you realize that your behavior
is just a bit extreme?!

311
00:17:52,399 --> 00:17:56,368
I displayed a minor bit of force in
order to just make a point.

312
00:17:56,368 --> 00:18:00,222
I didn't go around smashing windows
or torching lawns!

313
00:18:00,222 --> 00:18:01,581
Where does it end?

314
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:03,605
Are you saying that what I did was wrong?

315
00:18:03,605 --> 00:18:04,735
Of course I am!

316
00:18:04,735 --> 00:18:06,249
But what you did was okay?

317
00:18:06,249 --> 00:18:14,197
No, no!  I... come to think of it,
what I did was just as wrong.

318
00:18:14,197 --> 00:18:17,592
I mean, who am I to draw the line
at the acceptable level of force?

319
00:18:17,592 --> 00:18:20,430
Because the next person moves a little
farther, and the next person,

320
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:23,558
a little farther still until we finally
end up with scorpions flying

321
00:18:23,558 --> 00:18:28,099
through the mail like Christmas bundt cakes!

322
00:18:28,099 --> 00:18:31,926
What we must all agree to do is to resolve
our differences with

323
00:18:31,926 --> 00:18:34,879
discussion and reason.

324
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:37,879
As a matter of fact, I'm going to call
the gentleman that

325
00:18:37,879 --> 00:18:41,590
I manhandled and... and apologize to him
for not having worked

326
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:46,870
out our dispute in the right way in the
first place-through words.

327
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:50,128
The key here is restraint.

328
00:18:50,128 --> 00:18:56,159
And I do hopeyou'll follow my lead...
Becky with the nail gun.

329
00:19:05,845 --> 00:19:07,580
Oh... people.  People, please.

330
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:12,853
There's no need for that.  I'm no hero.

331
00:19:12,853 --> 00:19:14,795
No one's ever given me the thumbs up.

332
00:19:14,795 --> 00:19:16,722
Well, Niles, I've driven on the freeway with you.

333
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:21,003
The rest of the hand has been well-represented.

334
00:19:21,003 --> 00:19:25,004
Oh, look, there he is.  Mr. Harvey,
I'm so glad you could come.

335
00:19:25,004 --> 00:19:30,033
You remember my brother, Niles, and
uh... we're at "our" table.

336
00:19:30,033 --> 00:19:31,924
Look, I'm here, so say what's on your mind.

337
00:19:31,924 --> 00:19:34,025
Well, there's no need for any hostility.

338
00:19:34,025 --> 00:19:35,484
I just came to talk.

339
00:19:35,484 --> 00:19:38,881
Talk?  You're not gonna take another shot at me?

340
00:19:38,881 --> 00:19:42,761
No! No, they'll be nothing like that here today!

341
00:19:42,761 --> 00:19:45,268
Now, listen, I could try to explain
my behavior by saying that

342
00:19:45,268 --> 00:19:47,321
these are stressful times we live in, that

343
00:19:47,321 --> 00:19:48,602
I had reached the end of my tether.

344
00:19:48,602 --> 00:19:51,331
But I won't do that, because you see, I was 100% wrong.

345
00:19:51,331 --> 00:19:55,928
I had absolutely no right to touch
you and I accept full responsibility.

346
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:58,092
Well, I'm glad to hear you say that.

347
00:19:58,092 --> 00:19:59,785
And I hope you all heard that too.

348
00:19:59,785 --> 00:20:01,565
So, then you accept my apology?

349
00:20:01,565 --> 00:20:02,954
No, I'm suing you.

350
00:20:02,954 --> 00:20:05,795
And I've got a lot of witnesses that
just heard you admit you were wrong.

351
00:20:05,795 --> 00:20:08,531
But, but... these are stressful times we live in and

352
00:20:08,531 --> 00:20:10,492
I'd reached the end of my tether!

353
00:20:10,492 --> 00:20:13,953
Tough!  I'm nailing you for assault!

354
00:20:13,953 --> 00:20:15,585
But I hardly touched you!

355
00:20:15,585 --> 00:20:18,314
Oh, Frasier, I'm not surprised
he's hiding behind lawyers.

356
00:20:18,314 --> 00:20:24,280
What other behavior would you expect... from a chicken?

357
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,735
What did you say?

358
00:20:25,735 --> 00:20:27,025
I was speaking to my brother.

359
00:20:27,025 --> 00:20:30,863
But, to put it in language you can understand...

360
00:20:30,863 --> 00:20:31,752
bawk bawk bawk bawk!

361
00:20:31,752 --> 00:20:36,369
Niles!  This is no time for you to assert yourself!

362
00:20:36,369 --> 00:20:38,537
Hey, your brother's making trouble here...

363
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:39,992
Oh, oh, oh... what are you gonna do?

364
00:20:39,992 --> 00:20:43,481
Flap me with one of your big fluffy wings?

365
00:20:43,481 --> 00:20:45,410
Niles, stop it!  Please excuse him!

366
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,135
Oh, for god's sake, Frasier don't
waste your breath on this

367
00:20:47,135 --> 00:20:50,353
hairy, knuckle-dragging, mouth-breathing troglodyte

368
00:20:50,353 --> 00:20:57,817
who's probably the only male in
existence who suffers from penis envy!

369
00:20:57,817 --> 00:21:04,528
You look here, buddy...

370
00:21:04,528 --> 00:21:12,719
Niles!!  Niles... are you all right?!

371
00:21:12,719 --> 00:21:15,383
Counter suit!

372
00:21:15,383 --> 00:21:18,711
Oh, my god!!  Nobody move him!

373
00:21:18,711 --> 00:21:19,951
I barely touched him!

374
00:21:19,951 --> 00:21:21,585
Then you admit you touched him!

375
00:21:21,585 --> 00:21:23,856
He admits it!

376
00:21:23,856 --> 00:21:26,194
Oh, Niles.  Niles, I'm here for you.

377
00:21:26,194 --> 00:21:32,327
I promise we're going to get you
the best care that THIS MAN'S MONEY CAN BUY!

378
00:21:32,327 --> 00:21:33,667
My god, Niles, that was brilliant.

379
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:35,019
You even got a tear in your eye!

380
00:21:35,019 --> 00:21:38,315
I landed on a fork.
