1
00:00:12,491 --> 00:00:14,520
Oh, Dr. Crane

2
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,858
My God, after all our years together

3
00:00:16,858 --> 00:00:19,549
all the good times, all the bad times

4
00:00:19,549 --> 00:00:24,070
can't loan me a meager four
thousand dollars?

5
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:27,702
You must appreciate how hard it is
for me to approach you about this.

6
00:00:27,702 --> 00:00:31,427
I thought I meant more
to you than this, but apparently I don't.

7
00:00:31,427 --> 00:00:36,054
And they call themselves
"the friendly bank!"

8
00:00:36,054 --> 00:00:37,595
What do you need to borrow money for?

9
00:00:37,595 --> 00:00:41,013
I saw the most exquisite
Biedermeier footstool.

10
00:00:41,013 --> 00:00:42,628
For four thousand bucks?

11
00:00:42,628 --> 00:00:45,885
Niles, your mother and I didn't
pay that much for our first house.

12
00:00:45,885 --> 00:00:46,388
I know, dad.

13
00:00:46,388 --> 00:00:49,557
I lived there.

14
00:00:49,557 --> 00:00:50,357
Well, I keep telling you,

15
00:00:50,357 --> 00:00:52,549
you don't have Maris's money tothrow around anymore.

16
00:00:52,549 --> 00:00:54,033
You're going to have to start
cutting back a little.

17
00:00:54,033 --> 00:00:55,114
I have cut back.

18
00:00:55,114 --> 00:00:57,707
Last month I told my masseur 
I could only see him once a week.

19
00:00:57,707 --> 00:01:00,187
Oh, I remember that scene
in "Grapes Of Wrath"

20
00:01:00,187 --> 00:01:03,595
when Ma Joad did that.

21
00:01:03,595 --> 00:01:04,799
You know, if you need to save a bit,

22
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,876
you should do what I do
and cut out coupons.

23
00:01:07,876 --> 00:01:09,583
Coupons.

24
00:01:09,583 --> 00:01:11,797
Well, what a wonderful way to economize.

25
00:01:11,797 --> 00:01:16,474
Well, I could clip them and give them
to my personal shopper.

26
00:01:16,474 --> 00:01:17,643
Oh, Niles, good morning.

27
00:01:17,643 --> 00:01:18,298
Hey.

28
00:01:18,298 --> 00:01:20,644
Daphne, has Bebe Glazer called back yet?

29
00:01:20,644 --> 00:01:21,858
'Fraid not.

30
00:01:21,858 --> 00:01:24,980
You're still consorting with that barracuda?

31
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:28,357
Well, a barracuda is what 
you want in an agent, Niles.

32
00:01:28,357 --> 00:01:30,052
It's just that the station's been sold,

33
00:01:30,052 --> 00:01:33,177
I was hoping she might have some
scuttlebutt on the new owner.

34
00:01:33,177 --> 00:01:36,065
I must admit she's rather hard 
to get a hold of these days

35
00:01:36,065 --> 00:01:38,206
Oh, really?  I thought one just 
drew a pentagram on the floor

36
00:01:38,206 --> 00:01:44,393
and chanted "I summon thee" three times.

37
00:01:44,393 --> 00:01:44,866
Hello, Roz.

38
00:01:44,866 --> 00:01:47,817
Hey.

39
00:01:47,817 --> 00:01:48,788
What have you got on the new owner?

40
00:01:48,788 --> 00:01:49,292
Oh, plenty.

41
00:01:49,292 --> 00:01:49,893
Yeah?

44
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:57,093
Well, there's a little snapshot
of his psyche right there.

45
00:01:57,093 --> 00:01:59,654
He's an eighty-five year-old Texan.

46
00:01:59,654 --> 00:02:01,675
Practically no formal education but he went from

47
00:02:01,675 --> 00:02:03,511
errand boy at a radio station to owning his own

48
00:02:03,511 --> 00:02:07,238
media empire worth six hundred million.

49
00:02:07,238 --> 00:02:08,768
This is great, I don't even know

50
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:13,927
what "Renuzit" is, but it's
twenty cents off and I want it.

51
00:02:13,927 --> 00:02:15,384
You're clipping coupons?

52
00:02:15,384 --> 00:02:16,776
I'm economizing.

53
00:02:16,776 --> 00:02:19,942
Oh well it's about time, you spend
money like a drunken sailor.

54
00:02:19,942 --> 00:02:23,136
She said authoritatively.

55
00:02:23,136 --> 00:02:25,037
Excuse me, could we get back
to the subject at hand, please?

56
00:02:25,037 --> 00:02:26,165
What are you so antsy about?

57
00:02:26,165 --> 00:02:27,752
Dad, Wilford S. Boone-

58
00:02:27,752 --> 00:02:29,351
Big Willy.

59
00:02:29,351 --> 00:02:32,598
Please, Roz, I just can't say that yet, alright?

60
00:02:32,598 --> 00:02:35,900
Wilford S. Boone owns thirty radio
stations across the country.

61
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:39,109
If he likes you he's been known
to syndicate your show nationwide.

62
00:02:39,109 --> 00:02:42,055
So, I'm trying to find out
if we have anything in common

63
00:02:42,055 --> 00:02:43,577
an angle, if you will.

64
00:02:43,577 --> 00:02:44,982
So what are his interests, Roz?

65
00:02:44,982 --> 00:02:45,769
Well, it's all in there.

66
00:02:45,769 --> 00:02:49,064
He likes whittling, rodeos,
the novels of Zane Grey...

67
00:02:49,064 --> 00:02:54,360
Gee, Fras.  It's like you two were separated at birth.

68
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,953
He also owns a 5,000 acre cattle ranch and the world's

69
00:02:56,953 --> 00:02:59,737
largest collection of antique six-shooters.

70
00:02:59,737 --> 00:03:05,232
Oh dear God, I'm sucking up to Yosemite Sam!

71
00:03:07,017 --> 00:03:08,729
I think if we really want to impress Big Willy

72
00:03:08,729 --> 00:03:11,688
we should think of some Western
theme to do for the show today.

73
00:03:11,688 --> 00:03:12,526
Great idea, Roz.

74
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:14,272
Why don't we just start the
show off with a segment on

75
00:03:14,272 --> 00:03:17,126
how to get in touch with your inner young'un.

76
00:03:17,126 --> 00:03:19,006
What a fascinating theory!  Do go on.

77
00:03:19,006 --> 00:03:19,791
What's going on?

78
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:20,975
Oh, this is great.

79
00:03:20,975 --> 00:03:24,496
I told Gil the new station owner is a Greek tycoon.

80
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:25,399
He fell for that?

81
00:03:25,399 --> 00:03:29,317
Hook, line, and souvlaki!

82
00:03:29,317 --> 00:03:33,136
You can keep your overripe
Camembert and malodorous Stilton,

83
00:03:33,136 --> 00:03:36,919
they can't compare with the
salty insouciance of Greece's

84
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:40,424
glorious Feta.

85
00:03:40,424 --> 00:03:44,990
It's not just for shepherds anymore!

86
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:47,981
This is Gil Chesterton saying Bon Appetite,

87
00:03:47,981 --> 00:03:53,078
or as we say in Athens, Kali Orexi!

88
00:03:53,078 --> 00:03:54,709
Oh Gil, you've been had.

89
00:03:54,709 --> 00:03:57,396
The new station owner isn't Greek, he's from Texas.

90
00:03:57,396 --> 00:03:59,063
You are so easy!

91
00:03:59,063 --> 00:04:00,397
Well, I hope you're happy!

92
00:04:00,397 --> 00:04:03,692
I've just given four stars to a
restaurant called "A Taste Of Greece."

93
00:04:03,692 --> 00:04:06,662
Which, trust me, is no misnomer.

94
00:04:06,662 --> 00:04:07,830
Well that's what you deserve,

95
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:10,076
trying to suck up to some senile old coot!

96
00:04:10,076 --> 00:04:14,750
Hell, he probably can't eat anything
but strained peas and farina!

97
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:15,907
Uh, Mr Boone?

98
00:04:15,907 --> 00:04:17,596
Yeah, that's right.

99
00:04:17,596 --> 00:04:18,175
Pleasure to see you.

100
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:18,931
I'm Dr. Frasier Crane.

101
00:04:18,931 --> 00:04:21,397
This is Roz Doyle, Gil Chesterton and...

102
00:04:21,397 --> 00:04:22,877
I'm Skippy the lunch boy.

103
00:04:22,877 --> 00:04:26,813
So, uh, that's two strained peas
and a farina for the big guy.

104
00:04:26,813 --> 00:04:29,341
Oh, uh, Skippy?  Change my order!

105
00:04:29,341 --> 00:04:34,639
I've got a sudden hankering
for baby-back ribs and corn bread.

106
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,022
Oh, I've been looking for you Dr. Crane.

107
00:04:37,022 --> 00:04:40,415
I have a little problem and
they told me you're just the fella

108
00:04:40,415 --> 00:04:41,573
who could fix it.

109
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:42,951
Oh, I hope I'm not imposing.

110
00:04:42,951 --> 00:04:44,686
Oh, no, don't be silly, Mr. Boone.

111
00:04:44,686 --> 00:04:46,557
Well, actually I prefer "Big Willy."

112
00:04:46,557 --> 00:04:51,052
Don't be silly, Big Willy.

113
00:04:51,052 --> 00:04:53,793
You see, I'm engaged to be married.

114
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:54,854
Oh, congratulations.

115
00:04:54,854 --> 00:04:56,094
Well, sweet young thing.

116
00:04:56,094 --> 00:04:57,764
Just nuts about me.

117
00:04:57,764 --> 00:04:59,600
Problem is, she smokes.

118
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,845
Oh lord, that is a very bad habit.

119
00:05:01,845 --> 00:05:03,430
Oh, it's a vile habit!

120
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:06,351
Would have destroyed my affection for her if,

121
00:05:06,351 --> 00:05:11,207
well she didn't possess
certain... compensating gifts.

122
00:05:11,207 --> 00:05:15,848
Anyway, as a favour to me, could you help her?

123
00:05:15,848 --> 00:05:18,255
Well, I'll certainly try.

124
00:05:18,255 --> 00:05:22,671
Just keep in mind, though, addiction
is fraught with many complex issues.

125
00:05:22,671 --> 00:05:25,350
Length of habit, motivation...

126
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:28,565
Forgive me, sometimes I don't
express myself too clearly.

127
00:05:28,565 --> 00:05:31,855
When I say, "could you help her," what I meant to say was

128
00:05:31,855 --> 00:05:33,935
HELP HER!

129
00:05:33,935 --> 00:05:35,261
Consider it done.

130
00:05:35,261 --> 00:05:36,110
Much obliged.

131
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:38,019
She'll be in touch.

132
00:05:38,019 --> 00:05:43,020
That's me, Dr. Frasier Crane, bimbo wrangler.

133
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,263
Frasier, stop it!

134
00:05:44,263 --> 00:05:45,860
This is a golden opportunity!

135
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:49,062
You makethis little tootsie quit
smoking and we're halfway to syndication.

136
00:05:49,062 --> 00:05:51,029
Did someone just say the word "syndication,"

137
00:05:51,029 --> 00:05:54,244
or do I just hear it every time
I lay eyes on my favorite client?

138
00:05:54,244 --> 00:05:56,682
Oh, Bebe.

139
00:05:56,682 --> 00:05:58,257
Is something wrong, dear?

140
00:05:58,257 --> 00:05:59,068
Well, yes.

141
00:05:59,068 --> 00:06:00,242
We just met Big Willy...

142
00:06:00,242 --> 00:06:01,986
Oh, he thinks I'm some sort of a magician.

143
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:04,331
He wants me to play therapist to his little fiance?

144
00:06:04,331 --> 00:06:07,660
No doubt some gold-digging piranha
so devoid of scruples that

145
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,460
she's willing to rob the coffin and just...

146
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:12,488
Oh, dear God!

147
00:06:12,488 --> 00:06:14,051
Isn't it wonderful?

148
00:06:14,051 --> 00:06:17,009
We met last month and it was love at first sight.

149
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:21,297
First sight of what -
his bankbook and a cardiogram?

150
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:22,696
Two minutes.

151
00:06:22,696 --> 00:06:25,081
I'm hurt that she can even joke
about such a thing.

152
00:06:25,081 --> 00:06:28,544
I love that dear sweet old man
with every fibre of my being.

153
00:06:28,544 --> 00:06:29,787
I'm sure you do.

154
00:06:29,787 --> 00:06:31,428
I'm afraid there won't even be a wedding if you can't

155
00:06:31,428 --> 00:06:33,051
get rid of that rotten habit, and

156
00:06:33,051 --> 00:06:34,658
he's just ordered me to see that you do!

157
00:06:34,658 --> 00:06:38,657
God, you'd think a touch of
emphysema were the end of the world!

158
00:06:38,657 --> 00:06:41,489
What's that in your hand, woman?

159
00:06:41,489 --> 00:06:46,707
Sorry, pudd'n.  Bebe slipped.

160
00:06:46,707 --> 00:06:50,153
Just that all-important last puff.

161
00:06:50,153 --> 00:06:52,122
Well, see that it is!

162
00:06:52,122 --> 00:06:55,088
Well, Dr. Crane, I'm heading 
out of town for three days.

163
00:06:55,088 --> 00:07:00,195
When I get back on Sunday, I expect
my little gal here to be smoke-free by then.

164
00:07:00,195 --> 00:07:02,594
In... three days?

165
00:07:02,594 --> 00:07:06,616
Now, you do whatever it takes to help her, doc!  Drugs,

166
00:07:06,616 --> 00:07:11,231
straightjackets, electroshock...

167
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:13,786
You see how he dotes on me.

168
00:07:18,282 --> 00:07:20,512
Excellent progress, Bebe!

169
00:07:20,512 --> 00:07:22,402
You've really dived into the emotional void

170
00:07:22,402 --> 00:07:24,450
that is the route of your addiction.

171
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:27,136
Your fear of abandonment, your fear
that those you trust will

172
00:07:27,136 --> 00:07:29,366
suddenly turn their backs when you expect them to...

173
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:32,496
Excuse me.

174
00:07:32,496 --> 00:07:36,817
My God, it all seems so clear now.

175
00:07:36,817 --> 00:07:39,090
You're a miracle worker.

176
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:43,021
If I had a dime for every time... well...

177
00:07:43,021 --> 00:07:43,598
Niles!

178
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:46,658
Hello Frasier, I noticed you
were out of capers the other

179
00:07:46,658 --> 00:07:53,831
night, so I got you this.

180
00:07:53,831 --> 00:07:57,008
Thank you Niles, but why so many?

181
00:07:57,008 --> 00:08:02,974
I just discovered a place called
"Price Buster's Warehouse."

182
00:08:02,974 --> 00:08:05,338
You have to buy in bulk, but the
savings are extraordinary

183
00:08:05,338 --> 00:08:06,848
and they have a huge selection.

184
00:08:06,848 --> 00:08:11,510
I found french fries and french doors in the same aisle.

185
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:14,710
Well, the next time you go back
be sure to buy me a thousand

186
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:17,458
swordfish so I can use these up!

187
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:21,334
You laugh, but I could do it like that.

188
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:24,403
So, how goes the great smoke-out?

189
00:08:24,403 --> 00:08:28,404
Until today, I had no idea what
a brilliant therapist your brother is.

190
00:08:28,404 --> 00:08:32,699
He has tunneled his way into the very depths of my psyche.

191
00:08:32,699 --> 00:08:38,500
Well, let's hope he sent a canary down first.

192
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:42,181
Well, I'll be running along.

193
00:08:42,181 --> 00:08:44,701
I'll see you at ten tomorrow.

194
00:08:44,701 --> 00:08:48,594
In the mean time, it's exercise,
lots of fresh spring water

195
00:08:48,594 --> 00:08:50,734
and nicotine gum for cravings.

196
00:08:50,734 --> 00:08:51,494
That's my girl.

197
00:08:51,494 --> 00:08:53,959
Oh, Bebe, you know I'm writing
a paper on addiction and I'd

198
00:08:53,959 --> 00:08:55,166
love to ask you some questions -

199
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:58,858
unless there's some reason you're eager to be off?

200
00:08:58,858 --> 00:09:05,004
Me?  No.  No, not at all.

201
00:09:05,004 --> 00:09:08,197
Well, I just need to discuss
a personal matter with Frasier first.

202
00:09:08,197 --> 00:09:10,730
Of course, I'll give you some privacy.

203
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:14,132
It's time for my water anyway.

204
00:09:14,132 --> 00:09:15,171
Yes, Niles?

205
00:09:15,171 --> 00:09:17,035
Let her out that door,
she'll smoke half a pack before the

206
00:09:17,035 --> 00:09:19,220
elevator hits the lobby.

207
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,163
How can you know that?

208
00:09:20,163 --> 00:09:21,010
You hardly spoke to her.

209
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:23,724
Well, obviously you didn't
see the crazed, cunning glint in her eyes.

210
00:09:23,724 --> 00:09:30,546
She always looks like that, she's an agent.

211
00:09:30,546 --> 00:09:32,313
I know about addiction.

212
00:09:32,313 --> 00:09:38,530
It's the exact same look Maris
used to get during the cough syrup years.

213
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:40,364
The only way to deal with it is to lock her up,

214
00:09:40,364 --> 00:09:43,241
take her money, and watch her like
a hawk until it's out of her system.

215
00:09:43,241 --> 00:09:45,096
That means she would have
to stay here for the weekend.

216
00:09:45,096 --> 00:09:46,212
Who's staying all weekend?

217
00:09:46,212 --> 00:09:47,401
Bebe Glazer.

218
00:09:47,401 --> 00:09:48,508
Here?

219
00:09:48,508 --> 00:09:49,980
What does she have to stay here for?

220
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:50,977
She's trying to quit smoking.

221
00:09:50,977 --> 00:09:55,209
Oh great, that means she'll be extra lovable.

222
00:09:55,209 --> 00:09:57,722
Not to worry dad, there is no reason
she has to stay for the weekend.

223
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:59,658
Bebe and I made a real breakthrough today.

224
00:09:59,658 --> 00:10:01,450
If you don't believe me, just come on into the kitchen

225
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:06,032
and you'll see that I'm right.

226
00:10:06,032 --> 00:10:08,428
I'm sorry I can't stay and help
you with your paper, Niles,

227
00:10:08,428 --> 00:10:10,556
wedding preperations and all.

228
00:10:10,556 --> 00:10:12,229
But I'll remember those helpful hints.

229
00:10:12,229 --> 00:10:21,176
It's exercise, gum, and lots of water.

230
00:10:21,176 --> 00:10:26,291
Water should come in handy for
putting out those pesky purse fires.

231
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:28,399
All right Niles, secure the door!

232
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,426
Bebe, you are not going anywhere,
you're staying for the weekend.

233
00:10:30,426 --> 00:10:32,306
Now give me that purse.

234
00:10:32,306 --> 00:10:33,367
All right.

235
00:10:33,367 --> 00:10:36,944
Let me remove one very precious momento.

236
00:10:36,944 --> 00:10:38,237
Very well.

237
00:10:38,237 --> 00:10:39,612
Oh, stop it!

238
00:10:48,144 --> 00:10:49,452
More!

239
00:10:49,452 --> 00:10:50,736
What again?

240
00:10:50,736 --> 00:10:51,840
That's her third serving.

241
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:55,914
Now, now Dad, it's flattering to
Daphne that Bebe finds her food so tasty.

242
00:10:55,914 --> 00:10:57,582
I'm orally fixated.

243
00:10:57,582 --> 00:11:02,087
I could eat a half-stunned wharf
rat if you put some gravy on it!

244
00:11:02,087 --> 00:11:05,479
I'll bear that in mind come breakfast time.

245
00:11:05,479 --> 00:11:06,510
No, please, please.

246
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:08,385
Let's all try to remain supportive of Bebe.

247
00:11:08,385 --> 00:11:11,024
I think she's really doing rather well.

248
00:11:11,024 --> 00:11:14,465
So, I hear your fiancee is well to do?

249
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:15,872
Very.

250
00:11:15,872 --> 00:11:20,567
You gonna eat that fat?

251
00:11:20,567 --> 00:11:23,513
Well, marrying money can have it's perils.

252
00:11:23,513 --> 00:11:26,582
Ten or fifteen years down the line,
after you've adapted to a lifestyle

253
00:11:26,582 --> 00:11:29,110
now totally beyond your means,
you can find yourself cast

254
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:36,493
aside a hollow husk, penniless and crushed.

255
00:11:36,493 --> 00:11:39,141
Niles, Big Willy's eighty-five,
he's on his third pacemaker.

256
00:11:39,141 --> 00:11:40,072
Ah.

257
00:11:40,072 --> 00:11:45,244
Mazel tov!

258
00:11:45,244 --> 00:11:48,708
Just out of curiosity, has
this guy ever seen you eat?

259
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,741
After dinner is the time I need a cigarette most.

260
00:11:50,741 --> 00:11:52,859
As long as I don't stop eating, I'll be fine.

261
00:11:52,859 --> 00:11:53,940
Well, this is very good, Bebe.

262
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:57,035
You're already identifying those
moments that trigger your worst cravings.

263
00:11:57,035 --> 00:11:57,832
Yeah, yeah!

264
00:11:57,832 --> 00:12:00,535
No, really.  Perhaps it would help
to know that you're not alone.

265
00:12:00,535 --> 00:12:01,799
Dad is an ex-smoker.

266
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:05,245
Dad, can you tell us about
those moments you crave a cigarette most?

267
00:12:05,245 --> 00:12:07,659
Ah, when I had insomnia.

268
00:12:07,659 --> 00:12:11,215
I'd get up, pour a water glass
full of Bourbon, light a cigarette -

269
00:12:11,215 --> 00:12:14,768
next thing you know, I couldn't keep my eyes open.

270
00:12:14,768 --> 00:12:18,446
Nothing relaxes you like a cigarette.

271
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:24,323
Of course, gives you a hell of
a headache in the morning.

272
00:12:24,323 --> 00:12:28,856
Well, I smoked for years but I never became addicted.

273
00:12:28,856 --> 00:12:32,314
To this day, I can buy a pack, have a cig or two, toss

274
00:12:32,314 --> 00:12:35,447
them in a drawer and not crave another for months.

275
00:12:35,447 --> 00:12:37,648
You know there's a word for people who can do that.

276
00:12:37,648 --> 00:12:39,512
What is it?  Oh, yes -

277
00:12:39,512 --> 00:12:45,894
bitch!

278
00:12:45,894 --> 00:12:48,880
There's no need to be insulting
just because you're wrestling

279
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,192
with an unhealthy and disgusting habit.

280
00:12:51,192 --> 00:12:52,094
It isn't disgusting,

281
00:12:52,094 --> 00:12:53,351
it's wonderful!

282
00:12:53,351 --> 00:12:54,749
Oh now, Bebe, tell me.

283
00:12:54,749 --> 00:12:58,815
What is so wonderful about smoking?

284
00:12:58,815 --> 00:13:01,166
Everything.

285
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:05,721
I like the way a fresh firm pack feels in my hand.

286
00:13:05,721 --> 00:13:08,375
I like peeling away that little piece of cellophane

287
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:11,425
and seeing it twinkle in the light.

288
00:13:11,425 --> 00:13:17,200
I like coaxing that first sweet
cylinder out of its hiding place

289
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,446
and bringing it slowly up to my lips.

290
00:13:21,446 --> 00:13:25,385
Striking a match, watching
it burst into  a perfect little flame

291
00:13:25,385 --> 00:13:31,080
and knowing that soon that flame will be inside me.

292
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:34,853
I love the first puff, pulling it into my lungs.

293
00:13:34,853 --> 00:13:38,872
Little fingers of smoking filling me, caressing me,

294
00:13:38,872 --> 00:13:43,420
feeling that warmth penetrate deeper and deeper,

295
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:46,631
until I think I'm going to burst!

296
00:13:46,631 --> 00:13:57,080
Then - whoosh! - watching it flow
out of me in a lovely, sinuous cloud,

297
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:06,460
no two ever quite the same.

298
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:08,241
More potatoes, anyone?

299
00:14:52,534 --> 00:14:53,717
You're up early, Miss Moon.

300
00:14:53,717 --> 00:14:57,687
Oh!  God, you startled me!

301
00:14:57,687 --> 00:15:00,781
Ever since your little speech
about smoking, I haven't been

302
00:15:00,781 --> 00:15:03,612
able to think about anything else.

303
00:15:03,612 --> 00:15:06,437
Please, don't mention this to Dr. Crane.

304
00:15:06,437 --> 00:15:08,566
Silence has its price, dear.

305
00:15:08,566 --> 00:15:11,496
And I think we both know what that is.

306
00:15:11,496 --> 00:15:12,518
Forget it!

307
00:15:12,518 --> 00:15:14,620
You can't make me give you one of these.

308
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:18,045
Oh... can't I?!

309
00:15:18,045 --> 00:15:19,469
You open up right now!

310
00:15:19,469 --> 00:15:21,133
All right, missy, here's the drill!

311
00:15:21,133 --> 00:15:22,804
You drop those cigarettes, I'll open the door,

312
00:15:22,804 --> 00:15:24,955
you kick 'em over to me, capisce?

313
00:15:24,955 --> 00:15:29,100
No!

314
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:32,038
Oh, is it cold outside?

315
00:15:32,038 --> 00:15:35,621
All right, you asked for it!

316
00:15:35,621 --> 00:15:37,754
No!  No!  Please, I beg you.

317
00:15:37,754 --> 00:15:40,699
Oh, oh no.  My fingers are getting weak.

318
00:15:40,699 --> 00:15:42,656
Oh, oh, I'm losing my grip.

319
00:15:42,656 --> 00:15:46,053
Stop, please!  I'll give you
anything you want.  I'll...

320
00:15:46,053 --> 00:15:50,046
I'll make you a star!

321
00:15:50,046 --> 00:15:51,394
What the hell's going on out here?

322
00:15:51,394 --> 00:15:54,685
Daphne was smoking!

323
00:15:54,685 --> 00:15:57,108
She made me!

324
00:15:57,108 --> 00:16:00,211
Daphne, give me those.

325
00:16:00,211 --> 00:16:01,222
Oh, look at me!

326
00:16:01,222 --> 00:16:03,268
I'm all damp and chilled to the bone.

327
00:16:03,268 --> 00:16:04,661
I'll get you a towel.

328
00:16:04,661 --> 00:16:07,817
My God, it's five-thirty in the morning!

329
00:16:07,817 --> 00:16:15,707
Dad!

330
00:16:15,707 --> 00:16:18,457
I couldn't sleep.

331
00:16:18,457 --> 00:16:21,090
Have you people all lost your minds?

332
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:23,911
Alright, now listen, get
back to bed, every one of you!

333
00:16:23,911 --> 00:16:25,162
All right, all right...

334
00:16:25,162 --> 00:16:27,577
Thank god you came in when you did!

335
00:16:27,577 --> 00:16:29,465
She was praying on my weakness.

336
00:16:29,465 --> 00:16:31,903
Who knows what I might have done, probably...

337
00:16:31,903 --> 00:16:32,904
THIS!

338
00:16:32,904 --> 00:16:35,080
Oh, get her!  Stop that woman!

339
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,143
Bebe, you will not be allowed to
smoke a cigarette in this house!

340
00:16:37,143 --> 00:16:39,819
No, no, don't even think about it!

341
00:16:39,819 --> 00:16:40,801
All right, just give me those!

342
00:16:40,801 --> 00:16:42,329
All right now, that's it!

343
00:16:42,329 --> 00:16:43,480
Back to bed!

344
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:47,982
Oh my God, you're insane, woman!

345
00:16:47,982 --> 00:16:52,001
That's it, no more house guests.

346
00:16:52,001 --> 00:16:53,814
Get off me, you brute!

347
00:16:53,814 --> 00:16:54,472
Hand them over!

348
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:56,761
Never!

349
00:16:56,761 --> 00:16:59,704
That'll be the neighbours!

350
00:16:59,704 --> 00:17:02,511
Hello?  Oh, hello!

351
00:17:02,511 --> 00:17:04,017
One moment, please.

352
00:17:04,017 --> 00:17:06,668
It's Big Willy!

353
00:17:06,668 --> 00:17:08,379
Big Willy, hello!

354
00:17:08,379 --> 00:17:11,350
No, no, it's not too early, everybody's up!

355
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:14,358
Well, you know, there have
been a few minor setbacks, but

356
00:17:14,358 --> 00:17:16,861
I'm keeping on top of her, yeah.

357
00:17:16,861 --> 00:17:19,923
Oh yeah, I know she'd love to say hi, hang on.

358
00:17:19,923 --> 00:17:24,893
Hello, pudd'n.  I'm fine, and you?

359
00:17:24,893 --> 00:17:29,836
Oh, nothing's too much trouble
for you daddy.  Bye now!

360
00:17:29,836 --> 00:17:33,005
Yes, sir?  Oh, oh, really?

361
00:17:33,005 --> 00:17:33,685
No, no, I'm very flattered.

362
00:17:33,685 --> 00:17:37,051
Yes, of course, I'd love to,
I'll talk to you this evening.

363
00:17:37,051 --> 00:17:38,444
Bye-bye.

364
00:17:38,444 --> 00:17:39,965
Thank you, Daphne.

365
00:17:39,965 --> 00:17:41,677
All right, now listen up!

366
00:17:41,677 --> 00:17:42,874
He thinks I'm very gifted.

367
00:17:42,874 --> 00:17:43,284
Mmm.

368
00:17:43,284 --> 00:17:44,645
He thinks I'm wasting my talents in just one city!

369
00:17:44,645 --> 00:17:46,902
My God, woman, he wants to take
me national, don't you get it?

370
00:17:46,902 --> 00:17:49,084
Unless YOU ruin it for me!

371
00:17:49,084 --> 00:17:52,505
Oh my God, sorry.

372
00:17:52,505 --> 00:17:54,835
Here, take 'em.

373
00:17:54,835 --> 00:17:58,834
I don't know what came over me.

374
00:17:58,834 --> 00:18:01,124
Well, don't be too hard on yourself, Bebe.

375
00:18:01,124 --> 00:18:04,477
After all, addiction to Nicotine
is a very, very difficult... hey,

376
00:18:04,477 --> 00:18:09,165
wait a minute.  This pack is half-empty!

377
00:18:09,165 --> 00:18:11,555
For God's sake... I don't care anymore.

378
00:18:11,555 --> 00:18:13,651
You know, I can't help you, nobody can.

379
00:18:13,651 --> 00:18:14,674
You want to ruin it for both of us?

380
00:18:14,674 --> 00:18:15,173
Here,

381
00:18:15,173 --> 00:18:18,202
go ahead, knock yourself out.

382
00:18:18,202 --> 00:18:22,163
I only wish I could be there when it happens.

383
00:18:22,163 --> 00:18:23,699
When what happens?

384
00:18:23,699 --> 00:18:27,099
When you see that newspaper headline:

385
00:18:27,099 --> 00:18:33,161
"Big Willy Boone, Millionaire, Dead."

386
00:18:33,161 --> 00:18:37,867
Oh, how I wish I could be there
when you watch the funeral on the news.

387
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:40,929
Watch the casket being slipped into the ground.

388
00:18:40,929 --> 00:18:43,235
Only, you won't be watching that.

389
00:18:43,235 --> 00:18:45,561
No, no, you'll be watching...

390
00:18:45,561 --> 00:18:49,074
the widow Boone.  Tiffany, perhaps.

391
00:18:49,074 --> 00:18:51,524
Oh no, better yet, "Kelli" - with an "I"!

392
00:18:51,524 --> 00:18:54,080
Stop it!

393
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,856
You'll picture her wearing YOUR jewels,

394
00:18:56,856 --> 00:19:00,732
sailing in YOUR yachts, sleeping with YOUR gigolos -

395
00:19:00,732 --> 00:19:02,987
but, oh, you won't be sad, no, no, no!

396
00:19:02,987 --> 00:19:06,089
Because you'll have your cigarette.

397
00:19:06,089 --> 00:19:10,346
Yeah!  Clutched in your
nicotine-stained teeth, smoke

398
00:19:10,346 --> 00:19:15,233
whirling about your once-pretty,
now creased, leathery,

399
00:19:15,233 --> 00:19:16,217
smoke-ravaged...

400
00:19:16,217 --> 00:19:18,424
Enough!

401
00:19:18,424 --> 00:19:21,146
God!

402
00:19:21,146 --> 00:19:25,472
You are one hell of a therapist.

403
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:39,564
Hey, you back from the wedding already?

404
00:19:39,564 --> 00:19:40,553
No.

405
00:19:40,553 --> 00:19:41,779
There was no wedding.

406
00:19:41,779 --> 00:19:44,521
No wedding, no syndication deal...

407
00:19:44,521 --> 00:19:45,705
What's she doing here?

408
00:19:45,705 --> 00:19:47,200
No money, no fame...

409
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,952
Well, you might say things hit a bit of a snag.

410
00:19:48,952 --> 00:19:51,176
No beach house, no pool boys...

411
00:19:51,176 --> 00:19:54,327
Oh will you get a grip, Roz?!

412
00:19:54,327 --> 00:19:55,818
Well, what went wrong?

413
00:19:55,818 --> 00:19:58,403
Well, they were halfway down the aisle -

414
00:19:58,403 --> 00:20:01,768
Big Willy beaming proudly, Bebe radiant,

415
00:20:01,768 --> 00:20:03,056
supporting Big Willy on her arm -

416
00:20:03,056 --> 00:20:05,361
when suddenly he clutched his heart,

417
00:20:05,361 --> 00:20:08,583
and his head slumped against Bebe's shoulder.

418
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:10,418
Of course we were all concerned
at first, but then suddenly

419
00:20:10,418 --> 00:20:11,416
it seemed like he was all right

420
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:15,505
because they kept moving on down the aisle.

421
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:16,927
But if you looked carefully, you could see

422
00:20:16,927 --> 00:20:19,747
Bebe's little biceps bulging through her wedding gown,

423
00:20:19,747 --> 00:20:25,770
and I swear I noticed daylight
between Big Willy's dress boots and the carpet.

424
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:28,769
Well, once they got up to the
minister the jig was pretty well up,

425
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:32,022
despite Bebe's valiant attempts
to animate his features by

426
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:37,623
twisting the loose skin at the back of his neck.

427
00:20:37,623 --> 00:20:40,559
You know, I've never seen a woman more crushed.

428
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:43,641
Well, if I were you I'd get
her away from that balcony rail.

429
00:20:43,641 --> 00:20:46,104
The doorman gets ticked if you
even through a piece of gum

430
00:20:46,104 --> 00:20:50,567
over the side.

431
00:20:50,567 --> 00:20:54,168
Bebe, dear?  Please, come on in.

432
00:20:54,168 --> 00:20:55,814
That's a girl.

433
00:20:55,814 --> 00:20:57,481
All right, let me have a look at you.

434
00:20:57,481 --> 00:21:02,208
Come on, here we are.

435
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:04,429
Well, I don't really blame you, dear.

436
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:07,408
You know, Roz and I are both upset too.

437
00:21:07,408 --> 00:21:09,964
You know, look at it this way: at least

438
00:21:09,964 --> 00:21:12,615
you're no worse off than you were before.

439
00:21:12,615 --> 00:21:14,598
You don't know the things I did for that man -

440
00:21:14,598 --> 00:21:21,277
the depraved, Western-themed appetites I satisfied!

441
00:21:21,277 --> 00:21:24,077
He was eighty-five, how bad could it have been?

442
00:21:24,077 --> 00:21:28,315
Ever worn a saddle?

443
00:21:28,315 --> 00:21:31,662
Do I have to answer that?

444
00:21:31,662 --> 00:21:34,144
Well, you know, Bebe, there are
other Big Willys out there,

445
00:21:34,144 --> 00:21:35,213
better ones!

446
00:21:35,213 --> 00:21:37,007
Richer, older...

447
00:21:37,007 --> 00:21:38,990
Impotent!

448
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:43,934
Oh dear, you always know what to say.

449
00:21:43,934 --> 00:21:46,982
I know what hell I put you through over this.

450
00:21:46,982 --> 00:21:49,555
I insist that you take this,

451
00:21:49,555 --> 00:21:51,564
as a small token of my gratitude.

452
00:21:51,564 --> 00:21:53,427
Oh Bebe, really...

453
00:21:53,427 --> 00:21:56,126
Look, Roz!  It's a gold Rolex!

454
00:21:56,126 --> 00:21:58,519
Oh my goodness...

455
00:21:58,519 --> 00:22:02,319
Bebe... where did you get this?

456
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:05,418
Just don't wear it to the funeral.

457
00:22:11,427 --> 00:22:14,820
