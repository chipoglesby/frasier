1
00:00:17,948 --> 00:00:19,389
Morning.

2
00:00:19,389 --> 00:00:21,795
Morning.

3
00:00:21,795 --> 00:00:24,186
Morning?  Oh my God, Joe,

4
00:00:24,186 --> 00:00:28,297
get up!  Get up!  You were supposed to be out of here hours ago.

5
00:00:28,297 --> 00:00:33,520
You promised me that after we did the deed you'd be on your merry way.

6
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,500
I was.

7
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:40,697
Get dressed.  We've got to get you out of here before Dr. Crane gets up.

8
00:00:40,697 --> 00:00:44,092
Oh, no.  I smell coffee.  They're already up!

9
00:00:44,092 --> 00:00:46,986
Now don't worry.  I'll just lay low until the two of them...

10
00:00:46,986 --> 00:00:49,786
Oh my God, it's nine o'clock. I'm a half-hour late for work.

11
00:00:49,786 --> 00:00:51,955
Just give me a minute.  I'll get rid of them.

12
00:00:51,955 --> 00:00:54,161
Where's my underwear?

13
00:00:55,599 --> 00:00:58,214
Eddie, get back here!

14
00:01:01,711 --> 00:01:03,087
Good morning.

15
00:01:03,087 --> 00:01:07,661
Maybe for you.  I just spent five minutes trying to button these pants.

16
00:01:07,661 --> 00:01:15,590
That stupid dryer shrunk another pair on me.

17
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:20,465
Dad. Before you blame the dryer, have you ever considered stepping on the old bathroom scales?

18
00:01:20,465 --> 00:01:28,142
Oh, what's the point?  That thing's been ten pounds off for weeks.

19
00:01:31,315 --> 00:01:33,072
Daphne?

20
00:01:33,072 --> 00:01:36,585
Good morning, Dr. Crane.  Sorry I overslept.

21
00:01:36,585 --> 00:01:40,806
Well, time we all got our day started.  I'll just clear these dishes away.

22
00:01:40,806 --> 00:01:42,774
Wait, I wasn't finished with that yet.

23
00:01:42,774 --> 00:01:45,842
Whoops.  Sorry about that.

24
00:01:45,842 --> 00:01:47,719
Daphne, I wasn't quite finished with that toast either.

25
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:51,528
Oh, now, we can't have you running off to your squash game on a full stomach.

26
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:57,006
Yes ?how many championship matches have been marred by the heartbreak of toast cramp?

27
00:01:57,006 --> 00:01:58,681
Don't you have that Doctor's appointment?

28
00:01:58,681 --> 00:02:00,854
Yes, but it's not for 20 minutes yet.  What's going on here?

29
00:02:00,854 --> 00:02:02,418
Why are you giving us the bum's rush?

30
00:02:02,418 --> 00:02:06,072
Bum's rush!  Oh, I just love the American vernacular.

31
00:02:06,072 --> 00:02:10,408
So cute.  So quick.  So long!

32
00:02:10,787 --> 00:02:14,390
Better get my wallet first. Damn pants! You know ?

33
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:19,540
you spend fifteen dollars on a good pair of pants - you expect them to be shrink resistant.

34
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:25,519
Well, Dad, when you pay that kind of money what you're really paying for is the designer name!

35
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:26,664
Gotta go.  I'm so late.

36
00:02:26,664 --> 00:02:29,109
Oh hurry, hurry, hurry!

37
00:02:29,109 --> 00:02:30,153
I'll call you tonight.

38
00:02:30,153 --> 00:02:31,737
OK. Bye.

39
00:02:31,737 --> 00:02:33,534
OH..GOD
OH..GOD

40
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:37,607
Oh!

41
00:02:37,607 --> 00:02:39,379
Hello Joe.

44
00:02:52,915 --> 00:02:54,927
Here!
Oh, thank you.

45
00:02:54,927 --> 00:03:02,605
Well.  Can anyone think of anything to make this moment a bit more awkward than it already is?

46
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:12,756
Thank you, Eddie!

47
00:03:16,223 --> 00:03:17,940
THEY'RE PLAYING DO-SI-DO, BUT NOT FOR ME

48
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,246
Oh..Thank you very much

49
00:03:21,721 --> 00:03:24,144
Isn't that Dirk and Gabby Bindercott?

50
00:03:24,144 --> 00:03:25,260
Friends of yours?

51
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,889
Mmm.  Filthy rich.  Timber money.

52
00:03:26,889 --> 00:03:28,764
In their case it really does grow on trees!

53
00:03:28,764 --> 00:03:33,376
Dirk!  Gabby!  Oh, Dirk?

54
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,448
Hello, Niles.

55
00:03:36,448 --> 00:03:38,738
Dirk Bindercott ?my brother Dr. Frasier Crane.

56
00:03:38,738 --> 00:03:41,980
Ah ?I've heard your program.

57
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:45,754
Well ?I've seen your wife.

58
00:03:46,556 --> 00:03:50,867
So Niles ?I suppose I'll see you at the benefit on Sunday.

59
00:03:50,867 --> 00:03:53,159
I know Maris is coming.

60
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:59,032
Yes, Sunday.  Which benefit is Sunday?  I have so many benefits... on Sunday.

61
00:03:59,032 --> 00:04:02,462
The ho-down for the homeless.  You were invited?

62
00:04:02,462 --> 00:04:06,809
The ho-down?  Yippee-kai-yes!

63
00:04:06,809 --> 00:04:08,143
Must be Gabby.

64
00:04:08,143 --> 00:04:10,444
Certainly sounds like her.

65
00:04:10,444 --> 00:04:11,241
See you Sunday.

66
00:04:11,241 --> 00:04:13,240
Yes.  Till Sunday.

67
00:04:17,931 --> 00:04:19,481
I wasn't invited.

68
00:04:19,481 --> 00:04:21,128
Niles, it's one party.

69
00:04:21,128 --> 00:04:24,611
Yes, but when you're off the A-list for one party you're off for all of them.

70
00:04:24,611 --> 00:04:27,268
From now on I'll be relegated to B-list charity events.

71
00:04:27,268 --> 00:04:31,539
Grubby little theatre companies and last year's diseases.

72
00:04:31,539 --> 00:04:34,853
This often happens in these cases when two people separate ?

73
00:04:34,853 --> 00:04:38,017
their friends choose one spouse over the other.

74
00:04:38,017 --> 00:04:43,634
Surely they chose Maris because she's better connected and has more money than you do.

75
00:04:43,634 --> 00:04:47,486
Exactly which part of that was meant to ease my pain?

76
00:04:47,486 --> 00:04:49,165
Niles, I just think you're overreacting.

77
00:04:49,165 --> 00:04:50,442
Oh wait, wait.

78
00:04:50,442 --> 00:04:54,447
I know what happened.  My invitation just got lost in the mail.

79
00:04:54,447 --> 00:04:58,540
No ?it's not so far fetched.  It could have been missorted... or a stamp could have fallen off...

80
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:05,188
or it could have been stolen by my mail carrier.  Ho-downs are catnip to postal workers!

81
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:10,442
Well I'd ask you to explain that but then you would!

82
00:05:10,442 --> 00:05:12,681
I'm going to check with the post office.  You know ?

83
00:05:12,681 --> 00:05:20,026
I heard a story on the news the other day about a man who bought a piano at auction
and when he went to tune it he found a 40-year-old unmailed letter under the sounding board.

84
00:05:20,026 --> 00:05:24,701
Perhaps we should contact Feronte and Tisha (sp.??) ?see if they have your invitation?

85
00:05:24,701 --> 00:05:26,371
Poke fun now.

86
00:05:26,371 --> 00:05:32,230
We'll see who feels foolish this Sunday when I'm sipping champagne atop a mechanical bull!

87
00:05:33,322 --> 00:05:35,089
Cappuccino, please.

88
00:05:35,089 --> 00:05:38,241
Roz, I want to get your take on something.

89
00:05:38,241 --> 00:05:39,240
What?

90
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,776
Well.

91
00:05:41,776 --> 00:05:46,739
Daphne and Joe are having sex in my apartment and it leaves me in a rather awkward position.

92
00:05:46,739 --> 00:05:50,854
Doing what?  Bending over to look through the keyhole?

93
00:05:50,854 --> 00:05:52,999
Oh Frasier, come on, what is the big deal?

94
00:05:52,999 --> 00:05:58,648
Well, let's just say that I'm sitting there listening to music, reading a book...

95
00:05:58,648 --> 00:06:02,340
and Daphne and Joe are "back there."

96
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,417
So?

97
00:06:03,417 --> 00:06:07,122
Well, it just makes me uncomfortable.

98
00:06:07,122 --> 00:06:10,140
I'm going to ask Daphne not to sleep with Joe in the house anymore.

99
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:11,069
Is that too...?

100
00:06:11,069 --> 00:06:13,401
Amish?

101
00:06:14,445 --> 00:06:16,425
I was going to say selfish!

102
00:06:16,425 --> 00:06:23,246
Oh, let's see.  Please Daphne ?don't have sex.  It disturbs my reading!  No, that's not too selfish.

103
00:06:23,246 --> 00:06:25,895
Well, I just don't think a man should be uncomfortable in his own home.

104
00:06:25,895 --> 00:06:31,606
How am I supposed to relax when every giggle, every noise makes me... you know...?

105
00:06:31,606 --> 00:06:33,767
Picture it?

106
00:06:33,767 --> 00:06:38,476
Of course not.  Don't be ridiculous.  The very idea.

107
00:06:38,476 --> 00:06:40,928
You're picturing it right now, aren't you?

108
00:06:40,928 --> 00:06:43,925
Well, you made me.

109
00:06:48,004 --> 00:06:51,120
Hey, Fras.
Hey, Dad.

110
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,469
Is Daphne in?

111
00:06:52,469 --> 00:06:55,783
Yeah, and if you have any sense you'll pretend that nothing happened this morning.

112
00:06:55,783 --> 00:06:57,861
Ah, yes.  Denial.

113
00:06:57,861 --> 00:07:04,274
The sort of advice I'd expect from a man whose driver's license still lists his hair colour as brown.

114
00:07:05,479 --> 00:07:11,281
It was until you came back to town!

115
00:07:15,171 --> 00:07:19,995
Daphne.  I think we need to discuss what happened this morning.

116
00:07:19,995 --> 00:07:23,262
It's been bothering me all day.  It was entirely my fault.

117
00:07:23,262 --> 00:07:25,139
No, no.  I share the blame.

118
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:31,099
We never did have a formal discussion about the rules of the house, especially when it comes to... you know...

119
00:07:31,099 --> 00:07:34,718
I do want to apologise for any embarrassment I may have caused.

120
00:07:34,718 --> 00:07:40,164
You see, we can't go to Joe's because he's still building his house and he sleeps on a friend's couch.

121
00:07:40,164 --> 00:07:43,685
But I can assure you it will never happen again.

122
00:07:43,685 --> 00:07:45,499
Well, then our business is concluded.

123
00:07:45,499 --> 00:07:46,691
Meeting adjourned.

124
00:07:46,691 --> 00:07:53,475
The next time Joe spends the night, I'll notify you well in advance.

125
00:08:02,665 --> 00:08:09,629
Daphne.  I was just reviewing the minutes of our last meeting.

126
00:08:09,629 --> 00:08:11,227
There seems to be some confusion.

127
00:08:11,227 --> 00:08:12,041
Oh?

128
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:15,854
You see, my quibble is not with the lack of notification.

129
00:08:15,854 --> 00:08:20,352
I am just not comfortable with you and Joe sleeping together under my roof.

130
00:08:20,352 --> 00:08:22,880
Oh, I see.

131
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:26,066
I'm sorry about that, but it is my room, isn't it?

132
00:08:26,066 --> 00:08:28,601
Oh yes, yes.  And I want you to feel comfortable living here.

133
00:08:28,601 --> 00:08:34,369
I suppose it's more important for you to feel comfortable because, as you said, it is your roof.

134
00:08:34,369 --> 00:08:37,535
Oh.  Thank you for understanding.

135
00:08:37,535 --> 00:08:47,313
Not at all.  Joe and I are going away for the weekend but first thing Monday I'm going to start looking for me own place.

136
00:08:54,362 --> 00:08:57,967
Guess who?

137
00:08:57,967 --> 00:09:02,980
Daphne... em... I don't want you entertaining here but I also don't want you to move out.

138
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:06,626
Oh, I see.  So you want me to stay, but just not have a personal life?

139
00:09:06,626 --> 00:09:07,243
Well...

140
00:09:07,243 --> 00:09:09,216
No, no. That works out fine for me.

141
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:16,329
I'll just spend all day waiting on you and your father, then in the evenings retire to me room,
wrap meself in an Afghan and wait for the morning.

142
00:09:16,329 --> 00:09:25,762
And if my whimpering gets too loud for you ?you can just have me fixed like Eddie!

143
00:09:25,762 --> 00:09:28,092
That is not what I meant.

144
00:09:28,092 --> 00:09:30,229
This is difficult for both of us, Daphne.

145
00:09:30,229 --> 00:09:34,436
I have to express my feelings.  I also don't want to lose you.

146
00:09:34,436 --> 00:09:36,216
You're very important to me and my father.

147
00:09:36,216 --> 00:09:38,476
That's why my solution is best.

148
00:09:38,476 --> 00:09:42,156
I'll still be here during the day to take care of your father

149
00:09:42,156 --> 00:09:45,811
but nights and weekends I'll just go home to my own place.

150
00:09:45,811 --> 00:09:51,677
On top of which you can turn this room back into your beautiful study you used to have.

151
00:09:51,677 --> 00:09:53,816
Well ?I suppose, what other choice do we have?

152
00:09:53,816 --> 00:09:57,534
Of course it'll be a period of adjustment for all of us...

153
00:09:57,534 --> 00:10:03,729
...I know how much you two care about me and consider me part of the family but...

154
00:10:03,729 --> 00:10:07,156
You're picturing your study right now, aren't you?

155
00:10:07,156 --> 00:10:09,916
Well, you made me!

156
00:10:13,485 --> 00:10:16,851
She's such a groovy lady!

157
00:10:16,851 --> 00:10:17,621
Morning, Dad.

158
00:10:17,621 --> 00:10:20,270
Oh, morning.

159
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:21,277
You seen the phone?

160
00:10:21,277 --> 00:10:23,790
Oh, I probably left it in my room again.  Sorry.

161
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,710
Hey, I'm making breakfast Burritos.  You want one?

162
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:28,086
I'll passo!

163
00:10:28,624 --> 00:10:31,187
Suit yourself.

164
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:41,750
Dad.  Whatever happened to the silk pajamas I bought you?

165
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:44,634
Oh, Frasier, they're too la-dee-da for me.

166
00:10:44,634 --> 00:10:50,405
Besides, they shrank!

167
00:10:50,405 --> 00:10:55,220
Whoa ?there go my tater-tots.  You want a pile?

168
00:10:55,220 --> 00:11:01,801
Not that I don't enjoy a "pile" of breakfast as much as the next guy but I still think no.

169
00:11:01,801 --> 00:11:05,665
Dad, are you planning on going around like that all weekend?

170
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:09,485
Yeah, why not?  Daphne's off on her little trip.  It's just us guys.

171
00:11:09,485 --> 00:11:14,002
Besides I've been wearing pants round here for three years.  Enough!

172
00:11:14,002 --> 00:11:17,709
I see.  Look Dad, I just have to do this

173
00:11:17,709 --> 00:11:19,237
Thank you
All right.

174
00:11:19,237 --> 00:11:24,218
Now, listen.  It's no big deal but I couldn't find the remote control for the TV last night.

175
00:11:24,218 --> 00:11:29,647
Now I thought we agreed that its place was on that table next to my chair.

176
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:33,200
What was it like in the old days when you actually had to get up to change the channel?

177
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,634
It was hell!

178
00:11:38,016 --> 00:11:39,633
You expecting someone?

179
00:11:39,633 --> 00:11:43,708
The contractor.  I'm getting an estimate on restoring my study.

180
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:45,304
Why don't you use Joe?

181
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:49,457
I think Joe's done enough work in that room, thank you!

182
00:11:50,184 --> 00:11:52,283
Henry.  Thank you for coming on such short notice.

183
00:11:52,283 --> 00:11:52,917
No sweat.

184
00:11:52,917 --> 00:11:55,931
I'll just show you the room.

185
00:11:55,931 --> 00:11:59,624
Oh, this is my father. Don't get up!

186
00:11:59,624 --> 00:12:00,799
Like a cup of coffee?

187
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:01,542
That'd be great.

188
00:12:01,542 --> 00:12:05,642
Fine.  Look, the room is right down the hall there to the right.  I'll meet you there.

189
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:07,110
OK.

190
00:12:08,953 --> 00:12:13,788
Oh, Dad.  This is a small thing but you left the sponge in the sink again.

191
00:12:13,788 --> 00:12:14,921
So?

192
00:12:14,921 --> 00:12:21,832
Well, as I mentioned last evening,
if it stays wet, not only does it begin to smell but it becomes a breeding ground for bacteria.

193
00:12:21,832 --> 00:12:23,150
So?

194
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:33,004
So.  If I were to say wipe up that salsa that you spilled on the table just now
I would be leaving behind bacteria such as salmonella, lysteria, flagella.

195
00:12:33,004 --> 00:12:34,398
Now wouldn't that bother you?

196
00:12:34,398 --> 00:12:36,680
Yeah, I guess you're right ?it would bother me.

197
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:41,032
I wouldn't dream of touching that sponge now!

198
00:12:47,455 --> 00:12:54,401
Ah, yes. Our own foul-breathed little handy wet!

199
00:12:56,566 --> 00:13:00,077
HE CRIED WITH HIS BOOTS ON

200
00:13:08,914 --> 00:13:12,984
You've been leaving lights on in the apartment all weekend.  You know what that does to the electric bill?

201
00:13:12,984 --> 00:13:19,321
Suppose there's a nuclear power plant they had to build to keep that television on day and night?

202
00:13:19,321 --> 00:13:21,382
You moved my chair again, didn't you?

203
00:13:21,382 --> 00:13:22,044
No!

204
00:13:22,044 --> 00:13:23,695
Oh well, maybe Eddie did it.

205
00:13:23,695 --> 00:13:25,660
Eddie, you move my chair?

206
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:28,738
'Cause Frasier said he didn't do it and Frasier never messes around with my stuff.

207
00:13:28,738 --> 00:13:31,186
All right, I moved your damn chair.

208
00:13:31,186 --> 00:13:33,601
The way you have it turned ruins the symmetry of the room.

209
00:13:33,601 --> 00:13:35,657
The sight line loses all flow.

210
00:13:35,657 --> 00:13:40,975
Oh, the sight line.  And here I thought it was for some dumb reason.

211
00:13:42,598 --> 00:13:48,908
Would you get Eddie off of the couch, or else it's down through the garbage chute for the thrill ride of his life!

212
00:14:00,363 --> 00:14:02,821
Well, howdy partner.

213
00:14:02,821 --> 00:14:04,498
Save your snippy remarks.

214
00:14:04,498 --> 00:14:13,150
Fair enough.  Say, am I crazy or is there a bright golden haze on the meadow?

215
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:16,293
Stop it.  I'm in the middle of a social crisis.

216
00:14:16,293 --> 00:14:22,261
I just drove to the ho-down for the homeless assuming that Maris had simply neglected to forward my invitation.

217
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:31,928
Well, not only was I not on the guest list but Nelson, the parking attendant,
said he missed me at "The Luau for Lupus."

218
00:14:31,928 --> 00:14:34,446
Now it is official.  I'm a social outcast.

219
00:14:34,446 --> 00:14:36,494
Oh Niles, why do you even care about those people?

220
00:14:36,494 --> 00:14:40,493
In your hour of need they pretend you don't even exist.

221
00:14:40,493 --> 00:14:43,460
They treat you like you're a leper, a non-person.

222
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:46,402
But I really, really like them.

223
00:14:46,402 --> 00:14:48,762
I know, I know ?it makes me sound pathetic.  But

224
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:52,825
I'm newly separated.  These people have been my social circle for ten years.

225
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:56,171
Frasier ?they're my tribe.

226
00:14:56,171 --> 00:15:05,584
Well, I hate to break this to you, "Waltzes With Snobs," but

227
00:15:05,584 --> 00:15:08,993
they have left you on the mountaintop to die!

228
00:15:08,993 --> 00:15:15,577
Now Niles, maybe your friends wanted to invite you but they probably thought you'd be upset seeing Maris there.

229
00:15:15,577 --> 00:15:18,522
Of course.  You're absolutely right.

230
00:15:18,522 --> 00:15:19,706
Oh, that's ridiculous.

231
00:15:19,706 --> 00:15:22,010
Oh, why are you so negative?  These people do care about me.

232
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:24,621
Oh fine, very well.  Why don't you just call them?  Prove to me I'm wrong.

233
00:15:24,621 --> 00:15:26,602
Nothing would give me greater pleasure.  Where's your phone?

234
00:15:26,602 --> 00:15:27,771
It's in my bedroom.

235
00:15:27,771 --> 00:15:31,002
Where else would it be? And Dad's electric shaver is in the kitchen.

236
00:15:31,002 --> 00:15:35,891
You see, all our appliances are on an adventure this weekend.

237
00:15:40,557 --> 00:15:42,731
Well, are you proud of yourself, stirring things up?

238
00:15:42,731 --> 00:15:45,415
Why didn't you just let him think his friends were doing him a favour?

239
00:15:45,415 --> 00:15:49,912
Ah, yes.  The Martin Crane approach.  Better living through denial!

240
00:15:49,912 --> 00:15:53,877
You did the same thing with Daphne.  You couldn't just pretend that nothing was going on back there.

241
00:15:53,877 --> 00:15:58,005
Dad, I'm a psychiatrist.  I don't pretend.  I confront.  I resolve.

242
00:15:58,005 --> 00:16:00,443
Oh yeah, you really resolved this.  Now she's moving out.

243
00:16:00,443 --> 00:16:02,958
You know, I swear you just go looking for trouble.

244
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:05,736
Oh, that is so untrue.

245
00:16:05,736 --> 00:16:10,329
AND PERHAPS YOU CAN EXPLAIN THIS!!!

246
00:16:11,412 --> 00:16:15,825
A grown man's obsession with a sponge?  No, I can't!

247
00:16:15,825 --> 00:16:19,620
For the last two days I've asked you again and again as politely as I can to wring out the sponge.

248
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:22,068
But you don't even have the consideration to respect my feelings.

249
00:16:22,068 --> 00:16:23,429
Because your feelings are stupid!

250
00:16:23,429 --> 00:16:26,621
But they're my feelings!
And important to me!

251
00:16:26,621 --> 00:16:29,151
And because of that you should have the courtesy to respect them.

252
00:16:29,151 --> 00:16:32,251
Just like you respect my feelings when I asked you not to move my chair.

253
00:16:32,251 --> 00:16:33,735
Oh, that makes no sense at all.

254
00:16:33,735 --> 00:16:39,278
Oh, all right. You want me to dry that sponge? 'll dry that sponge!

255
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,719
Give it about a minute.
Oh, that's mature.

256
00:16:44,719 --> 00:16:48,245
Oh, boy ?you know what a tortured little world you live in?

257
00:16:48,245 --> 00:16:52,354
Newspapers strewn all over the place.  Sponge germs coming after you.

258
00:16:52,354 --> 00:16:53,960
It's a wonder you can sleep at night!

259
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,423
Oh, my dreams get me by.

260
00:16:56,423 --> 00:17:01,663
Like the one where I strap you in your chair and run around the house turning on all the lights...

261
00:17:01,663 --> 00:17:08,689
...even in the rooms I'm nowhere near.  Boy, that electric meter must really be spinning now!

262
00:17:09,823 --> 00:17:12,896
Evening, all.  Did you boys have a nice weekend?

263
00:17:12,896 --> 00:17:14,327
Barrel of laughs!

264
00:17:14,327 --> 00:17:16,735
Well, I had the loveliest time.

265
00:17:16,735 --> 00:17:19,033
Hey ?Off!

266
00:17:19,033 --> 00:17:22,998
We found this little bed-and-breakfast right up the coast.

267
00:17:22,998 --> 00:17:25,233
I talked my decision over with Joe,

268
00:17:25,233 --> 00:17:28,826
and he agreed it really is the best thing for everyone.

269
00:17:28,826 --> 00:17:33,453
Of course I'll still be here during the day to help your father with his exercises.

270
00:17:33,453 --> 00:17:40,222
But nights and weekends it'll just be you two carefree bachelors getting into trouble together.

271
00:17:40,222 --> 00:17:43,503
I'm usually just underfoot around here anyway.

272
00:17:43,503 --> 00:17:48,946
So you see, my decision is best for everyone.

273
00:17:48,946 --> 00:17:53,755
Well, I've had a long weekend, so good night.

274
00:17:54,413 --> 00:17:56,603
Night, Daphne.

275
00:17:59,868 --> 00:18:01,631
Frasier.

276
00:18:01,631 --> 00:18:03,233
What?

277
00:18:03,233 --> 00:18:09,220
You know how an Oreo has that soft creamy filling between two hard cookies?

278
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:13,246
That's what keeps them together?

279
00:18:13,246 --> 00:18:15,199
See your point, Dad.

280
00:18:15,199 --> 00:18:17,524
Daphne's kind of the centre.

281
00:18:17,524 --> 00:18:19,223
I'll go and talk to her.

282
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:23,870
Now, you and me, we'd be the cookie part.

283
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:26,618
I get it!

284
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:35,171
May I come in?

285
00:18:35,171 --> 00:18:37,830
Yes, of course.
Thank you, Daphne.

286
00:18:40,075 --> 00:18:43,698
Daphne... er... you can't go.  You have to stay.

287
00:18:43,698 --> 00:18:46,612
I've only just recently realised how important you are to us.

288
00:18:46,612 --> 00:18:50,577
You see, if you go, Dad and I will kill each other.

289
00:18:50,577 --> 00:18:53,576
I'm not just tossing out hyperbole here.  I'm speaking in the most literal sense.

290
00:18:53,576 --> 00:18:55,534
Dad and I ?both dead!

291
00:18:55,534 --> 00:19:03,082
Only he'll be lying there with a bacteria-ridden sponge protruding from his mouth like a bloated tongue.

292
00:19:03,082 --> 00:19:06,052
You don't really want that on your conscience, do you?

293
00:19:06,052 --> 00:19:11,930
No, of course not.  Truth is, I do still think of this place as my home.

294
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:14,959
But I know you'd never be comfortable knowing Joe and I were...

295
00:19:14,959 --> 00:19:18,009
I'd be willing to try.

296
00:19:18,009 --> 00:19:22,319
I know you better than that.  It'll bother you and we'll both be miserable.

297
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:25,333
Why can't I get past this?

298
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:31,053
Oh, it'd just be easier if I could be like my father pretending you weren't in here making love.

299
00:19:31,053 --> 00:19:34,641
Making love?  Is that what you think we were doing?

300
00:19:34,641 --> 00:19:36,651
Yes, of course.

301
00:19:36,651 --> 00:19:40,581
Oh no.  There was nothing like that going on in here.

302
00:19:40,581 --> 00:19:43,569
Really?

303
00:19:43,569 --> 00:19:51,775
Seems rather implausible.  I'd like to believe that and believe me I really do want to... er...

304
00:19:51,775 --> 00:19:53,592
how can I?

305
00:19:53,592 --> 00:20:01,774
Well, how could Joe and I make love?  What with... er... Joe's war injury?

306
00:20:01,774 --> 00:20:04,550
I didn't even know Joe was a soldier.  What war would that be?

307
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:06,895
The Falkland Islands.

308
00:20:06,895 --> 00:20:08,538
But that was a British conflict and Joe's not...

309
00:20:08,538 --> 00:20:13,615
His parents have a summerhouse there!

310
00:20:13,615 --> 00:20:16,121
Oh, that's very unfortunate.

311
00:20:16,121 --> 00:20:20,787
Having a summerhouse in a war zone.  But how-?

312
00:20:20,787 --> 00:20:23,079
He was kicked by a sheep.

313
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:23,811
A sheep?

314
00:20:23,811 --> 00:20:27,718
Yes, a sheep ?spooked by an air raid siren.  Work with me.

315
00:20:27,718 --> 00:20:32,929
Oh, I see.  So, what you're saying is that Joe...

316
00:20:32,929 --> 00:20:34,752
Can't.

317
00:20:34,752 --> 00:20:37,238
Ah.

318
00:20:37,238 --> 00:20:38,652
Well, I suppose that changes everything.

319
00:20:38,652 --> 00:20:41,481
Ys, I suppose it does.

320
00:20:41,481 --> 00:20:46,888
But just so as we're clear - even though there's no actual lovemaking,

321
00:20:46,888 --> 00:20:53,667
Joe and I can on occasion, say, read poems to each other in here at night?

322
00:20:53,667 --> 00:20:57,614
As long as you don't read too loudly.

323
00:21:03,311 --> 00:21:05,626
She's staying.

324
00:21:05,626 --> 00:21:13,049
Turns out they're sleeping together but not having sex.

325
00:21:13,049 --> 00:21:26,177
See, they can't have sex because of an injury Joe suffered
when kicked by a spooked sheep during an air raid while his family were vacationing in the Falkland Islands during the war.

326
00:21:26,177 --> 00:21:28,966
Well, Dad was right.  They are my real friends.

327
00:21:28,966 --> 00:21:31,561
It was all just a misunderstanding.

328
00:21:31,561 --> 00:21:36,243
Apparently the social chairman's dog ate my invitation.

329
00:21:36,243 --> 00:21:40,503
And the poor animal had to go to the vet and with all the confusion they forgot to send me another, and

330
00:21:40,503 --> 00:21:49,469
when I offered my new address for next year's party, they said, "no need ?we'll see you around."

331
00:21:49,469 --> 00:21:56,336
I'm going to start wearing sweat pants. That damned drier again.

332
00:21:56,336 --> 00:21:58,565
Hey, you guys want some cookies? They're reduced fat.

333
00:21:58,565 --> 00:22:02,910
Really?  That means we can eat twice as many.
