1
00:00:09,216 --> 00:00:13,512
That's all for today.
Bob Bulldog Briscoe is up next.

2
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,683
Oh, yes! This is KACL cash call week.

3
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:21,771
$5,000 if you answer your phone
with the phrase that pays.

4
00:00:21,937 --> 00:00:24,440
So don't say ''Hello''. Say...

5
00:00:24,607 --> 00:00:26,650
Well, blow me down!

6
00:00:26,817 --> 00:00:32,323
No. Say, ''KACL is the talk of the town,
talk of Seattle.'' Whatever. Bye-bye.

7
00:00:33,782 --> 00:00:36,243
Sam! Oh, my God!

8
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:43,417
- What are you doing in town?
- l'm here interviewing for a job.

9
00:00:43,584 --> 00:00:47,129
The Mariners need a pitching coach
and called me.

10
00:00:47,296 --> 00:00:50,758
They did?
l mean, that's great. Come on in.

11
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:54,762
- You're off the air?
- Yes.

12
00:00:54,928 --> 00:00:57,222
Frase, l got to go. Your messages...

13
00:00:57,389 --> 00:01:00,017
Whoa. Who is this?

14
00:01:01,643 --> 00:01:05,564
l'm Sam Malone.
l was a buddy of Frasier's in Boston.

15
00:01:05,731 --> 00:01:07,024
Roz Doyle.

16
00:01:07,191 --> 00:01:11,820
This is the Sam who has no respect
for women and treats them like dirt?

17
00:01:13,113 --> 00:01:15,908
Need anyone
to show you around Seattle?

18
00:01:16,074 --> 00:01:21,455
l'm all right with the city,
but l get real lost in my hotel room.

19
00:01:23,165 --> 00:01:25,792
Look at the two of you, face to face.

20
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:30,756
Wild animals everywhere are
lifting their heads, alerted to the scent.

21
00:01:30,922 --> 00:01:32,382
Bye, Roz.

22
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:36,511
lf you need any company, give me a call.

23
00:01:36,678 --> 00:01:39,222
- Snazzy card.
- lt glows in the dark.

24
00:01:39,389 --> 00:01:41,266
So do l.

25
00:01:43,894 --> 00:01:46,480
So how's everybody at Cheers?

26
00:01:48,106 --> 00:01:53,028
Well, let's see...
Rebecca married that plumber.

27
00:01:53,195 --> 00:01:58,283
She tries so hard to land a rich guy
and ends up with an ordinary plumber.

28
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:03,872
He struck gold. He's got a patent
on some low-flow toilet thing.

29
00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:06,666
He's rich beyond her wildest dreams.

30
00:02:06,833 --> 00:02:10,920
- l'm happy for her.
- Don't be. He dumped her.

31
00:02:12,922 --> 00:02:16,468
- She's back at the bar.
- Working at Cheers again?

32
00:02:16,634 --> 00:02:19,012
No, she's just back at the bar.

33
00:02:20,221 --> 00:02:24,726
Here's some good news.
Woody and Kelly had a baby boy.

34
00:02:24,893 --> 00:02:27,103
That is wonderful!

35
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:29,189
ls he...?

36
00:02:29,355 --> 00:02:32,108
No, he's smart.

37
00:02:35,486 --> 00:02:38,072
Genetics takes a holiday, huh?

38
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,576
- Want to continue this over lunch?
- l'd like that.

39
00:02:41,743 --> 00:02:46,581
- Norm and Cliff still holding up the bar?
- Norm is, but Cliff isn't.

40
00:02:46,748 --> 00:02:52,086
He read about that flesh-eating bug
and hasn't left his mum's house since.

41
00:02:53,212 --> 00:02:57,133
lt's good cos a lot of people
who haven't been around

42
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,594
are starting to come back.

43
00:03:05,308 --> 00:03:09,729
Sam was a Major League ballplayer.
Put out the good china.

44
00:03:09,896 --> 00:03:13,441
And don't forget the Limoges spittoon.

45
00:03:15,985 --> 00:03:20,531
Sam's the most important person
ever to set foot in this apartment.

46
00:03:20,698 --> 00:03:25,578
This American obsession with
superficial sports figures beats me.

47
00:03:25,745 --> 00:03:30,875
Yeah. They don't do anything important
like sit on a throne or christen ships.

48
00:03:31,834 --> 00:03:34,420
Niles, why didn't you bring Maris?

49
00:03:34,587 --> 00:03:38,549
Ask Maris to spend an evening
with a baseball player?

50
00:03:38,716 --> 00:03:42,720
Why don't l just ask her
to rub my shoulders?

51
00:03:44,096 --> 00:03:47,224
- Here we are.
- Wow, look at this.

52
00:03:47,391 --> 00:03:49,935
You got quite a babe magnet here.

53
00:03:51,312 --> 00:03:56,650
Sam Malone! l'm Marty Crane!
l'm one of your biggest fans!

54
00:03:56,817 --> 00:04:02,114
l was at the Kingdome the night you
gave up four consecutive home runs.

55
00:04:02,281 --> 00:04:07,369
- l bet you remember that.
- No, that was during my drinking phase.

56
00:04:07,536 --> 00:04:11,123
- Did l hit anybody? Did l hurt them?
- No.

57
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:14,376
Hey, that was a good game then.

58
00:04:15,043 --> 00:04:20,007
- This is my chair. You want to sit in it?
- Oh, yeah. Well, maybe later.

59
00:04:21,592 --> 00:04:23,719
l'll keep it warm for you.

60
00:04:24,803 --> 00:04:29,725
- This is my brother, Dr Niles Crane.
- Pleasure to meet you.

61
00:04:30,851 --> 00:04:35,522
Man, this is freaky. He looks
just like you did when l met you.

62
00:04:36,815 --> 00:04:38,942
What happened?

63
00:04:40,027 --> 00:04:44,281
lt wasn't exactly a health club
you were running there, Sam.

64
00:04:45,782 --> 00:04:49,077
This is strange.
l didn't know he had a brother.

65
00:04:52,873 --> 00:04:57,919
<i>ln all the time you spent swapping
bon mots with the beer-nut set,</i>

66
00:04:58,086 --> 00:05:00,964
you never mentioned
you had a brother?

67
00:05:02,007 --> 00:05:07,220
l bet he said something, but when
he gets going, you have to tune him out.

68
00:05:07,387 --> 00:05:12,017
Good slogan for his show: ''When he
gets going, you have to tune him out.''

69
00:05:13,852 --> 00:05:17,772
What did he say about me?
The father, the old cop?

70
00:05:18,857 --> 00:05:21,359
He told me you were dead.

71
00:05:22,026 --> 00:05:24,821
- Dead?
- We had had an argument.

72
00:05:24,988 --> 00:05:28,199
You called me
a stuffed shirt and hung up on me.

73
00:05:28,366 --> 00:05:32,620
You're a cop? You told me
he was a research scientist.

74
00:05:33,913 --> 00:05:37,125
You were dead! What did it matter?

75
00:05:42,338 --> 00:05:47,844
Daphne, this is Sam Malone. Daphne
Moon, Dad's physical therapist.

76
00:05:48,011 --> 00:05:50,263
Pleasure to meet you.

77
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:54,308
- Daphne's from England.
- l'm a sucker for the accent.

78
00:05:54,475 --> 00:05:59,355
No matter what you say, it always
sounds so classy and sophisticated.

79
00:05:59,522 --> 00:06:01,816
(Gushes effusively)

80
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:05,403
See what l mean?
That kills me every time.

81
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:10,408
Let me get that. You shouldn't spend
your whole evening in the kitchen.

82
00:06:17,915 --> 00:06:20,626
ls Sam flirting with Daphne?

83
00:06:20,793 --> 00:06:23,963
Of course he is.
He flirts with everybody.

84
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:28,551
He's a sexual compulsive. But
he's getting help in a support group.

85
00:06:28,718 --> 00:06:31,887
(Laughter in the kitchen)

86
00:06:32,054 --> 00:06:34,473
Did he miss a meeting?

87
00:06:37,852 --> 00:06:39,895
(Telephone rings)

88
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:44,733
Hello? You'd like to speak to Sam?

89
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:49,363
- Who is it?
- Who's calling, please? Sheila.

90
00:06:51,949 --> 00:06:56,078
He's not here,
but l'm expecting him soon.

91
00:06:56,245 --> 00:07:01,166
- No! Number two!
- l'm sorry. l was mistaken.

92
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:04,294
He was here, but he left.

93
00:07:07,881 --> 00:07:10,551
l'll give him the message. Thank you.

94
00:07:10,718 --> 00:07:14,138
l'm sorry, Sam.
l'm a little out of practice.

95
00:07:15,973 --> 00:07:19,059
So...who's Sheila?

96
00:07:19,226 --> 00:07:22,521
Just the woman l'm supposed to marry.

97
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:25,732
Marry? When?

98
00:07:27,442 --> 00:07:29,695
Oh, boy. Yesterday.

99
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:34,575
- Yesterday.
- l don't want to talk about it.

100
00:07:34,741 --> 00:07:37,619
- But, Sam...
- Frase, please?

101
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:41,206
Something smells yummy here.

102
00:07:41,373 --> 00:07:44,126
Wait a second. l think it's me.

103
00:07:45,627 --> 00:07:48,296
The smell... And l thought...

104
00:07:50,966 --> 00:07:53,593
Come on, Sam, one more.

105
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:58,181
1 949, Yankees, initials VR.

106
00:07:58,348 --> 00:08:00,600
- Vic Raschi.
- You're great!

107
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:05,355
You just have to give him
the city, the date and the initials.

108
00:08:05,522 --> 00:08:10,193
That's similar to a game
Frasier and l play. l'll go first.

109
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:14,155
1 962, Prague Philharmonic,
viola section, initials CM.

110
00:08:14,322 --> 00:08:17,325
- Czeslaw Milovicz.
- Wrong!

111
00:08:17,492 --> 00:08:21,871
No, Milovicz was first viola
the year before,

112
00:08:22,038 --> 00:08:26,918
but by '62, he'd developed rosin
poisoning and couldn't pluck.

113
00:08:27,085 --> 00:08:29,129
That's a trick question!

114
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,425
Well, l'm off to bed.

115
00:08:34,592 --> 00:08:38,638
Thanks, Sam. The chair's all yours.

116
00:08:38,805 --> 00:08:40,849
Come on!

117
00:08:42,851 --> 00:08:46,271
Oh, yeah. That's very nice.

118
00:08:46,437 --> 00:08:48,648
Night, all.

119
00:08:48,815 --> 00:08:51,067
- l'm turning in.
- Pleasant dreams.

120
00:08:51,234 --> 00:08:53,278
No problem there.

121
00:08:55,154 --> 00:08:58,700
l'm off to my Maris.
lf the clock strikes twelve

122
00:08:58,866 --> 00:09:02,787
and she hasn't felt my kiss upon
her forehead, she gets nervous.

123
00:09:02,954 --> 00:09:05,748
- lt's been a pleasure meeting you.
- You, too.

124
00:09:05,915 --> 00:09:10,711
You want to put a smile on Maris's face?
Let me tell you what you do.

125
00:09:13,339 --> 00:09:17,635
Where would l find whipped cream
and a car battery at this hour?

126
00:09:18,928 --> 00:09:21,931
You got neighbours, don't you?

127
00:09:27,895 --> 00:09:32,483
Now that everybody's gone, there
was something l wanted to bring up.

128
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:35,569
What is it? Oh, yes!

129
00:09:35,736 --> 00:09:38,572
You were about to get married?

130
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:46,997
l met this girl six months ago
and we were supposed to get married.

131
00:09:47,164 --> 00:09:52,169
Yesterday, l was standing in this
church and l hear this minister say,

132
00:09:52,336 --> 00:09:56,465
''Will you take this woman
to be your wife?'' And l said,

133
00:09:56,632 --> 00:09:58,551
''Who, me?''

134
00:09:59,843 --> 00:10:04,139
l ran down the aisle
and didn't stop running till l got here.

135
00:10:04,306 --> 00:10:06,392
You're not here for the Mariners?

136
00:10:06,558 --> 00:10:10,688
No ballplayer is in Seattle
for the Mariners!

137
00:10:10,854 --> 00:10:17,361
All right. Let's have a seat here and
start this thing from the very beginning.

138
00:10:19,363 --> 00:10:24,576
- Who is this woman?
- She's terrific. Smart, funny, horny.

139
00:10:24,743 --> 00:10:28,539
The kind of chick you want
to stick up on a pedestal.

140
00:10:28,705 --> 00:10:30,791
lt's always amazed me

141
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:34,419
how you can elevate and demean
in the same sentence.

142
00:10:36,213 --> 00:10:38,840
- What?
- Forget it, just...

143
00:10:39,716 --> 00:10:42,970
How do you think she found me here?

144
00:10:43,136 --> 00:10:48,058
l guess you left a lot of clues
because you wanted her to find you.

145
00:10:48,225 --> 00:10:54,898
l have a feeling you actually...
want to marry this girl.

146
00:10:55,065 --> 00:10:57,150
Yeah, l don't know...

147
00:10:57,317 --> 00:11:00,862
You just panicked. lt's perfectly natural.

148
00:11:01,029 --> 00:11:05,784
The wedding ceremony
represents the end of your old life.

149
00:11:05,951 --> 00:11:09,621
l tell you, man, she's one in a million.

150
00:11:09,788 --> 00:11:13,083
For most guys,
that's just an expression.

151
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:22,759
l have a feeling that you're finally
ready for a commitment like this.

152
00:11:23,927 --> 00:11:27,806
- Get on that phone and call her.
- What would l say though?

153
00:11:27,972 --> 00:11:30,183
Tell her the truth.

154
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:34,938
Honesty is the cornerstone
of a healthy relationship.

155
00:11:37,524 --> 00:11:39,984
Thank you.

156
00:11:40,151 --> 00:11:44,364
lt's time l stepped up to the plate
and stopped acting like a kid.

157
00:11:44,531 --> 00:11:48,576
The only question now is:
will she still take you back?

158
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:03,508
- She forgave him?
- Yes. She's on her way here.

159
00:12:03,675 --> 00:12:05,718
They're getting married in Hawaii.

160
00:12:05,885 --> 00:12:09,597
Same old story.
Love triumphs over Roz.

161
00:12:09,764 --> 00:12:15,103
Don't be a sore loser. l invited them
here on their way in from the airport.

162
00:12:15,269 --> 00:12:19,065
l remember my wedding day,
feeling faint, shaking, sweating.

163
00:12:19,232 --> 00:12:22,318
Maris was so distraught,
thinking l had cold feet.

164
00:12:22,485 --> 00:12:27,823
She was relieved to learn it was
just a congenital heart murmur.

165
00:12:28,824 --> 00:12:31,035
- Hey, everybody.
- Oh, Sam!

166
00:12:31,202 --> 00:12:35,289
Here she is,
the future Mrs Sam Malone.

167
00:12:35,456 --> 00:12:38,626
- Sheila, Frasier.
- Nice to finally meet you.

168
00:12:38,793 --> 00:12:42,755
Likewise. This is Roz and Niles.

169
00:12:42,922 --> 00:12:46,384
- Congratulations.
- You want to sit down?

170
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:49,053
Actually, it was a long flight.

171
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:52,556
l was hoping to go
to the hotel and freshen up.

172
00:12:52,723 --> 00:12:56,477
All right. Will you join us
for dinner about eight?

173
00:12:56,644 --> 00:12:58,771
Sure.

174
00:12:58,938 --> 00:13:02,107
Well, l guess we're off
to freshen up a little.

175
00:13:06,111 --> 00:13:10,741
- Oh, my God!
- She's not an ''Oh, my God!''

176
00:13:10,908 --> 00:13:13,243
No. Not that ''Oh, my God''.

177
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:16,705
Oh, my God, l slept
with her three months ago.

178
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,752
- You slept with her?
- Yes.

179
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:25,881
On what desert island
with no hope of rescue was this?

180
00:13:28,258 --> 00:13:31,345
l was in Boston for a long weekend.

181
00:13:31,512 --> 00:13:33,555
l was feeling a little depressed

182
00:13:33,722 --> 00:13:38,352
so l took solace in the arms
of a beautiful

183
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:42,064
and remarkably welcoming
young woman at a hotel bar.

184
00:13:42,231 --> 00:13:44,524
- And that was she?
- No, Niles.

185
00:13:44,691 --> 00:13:47,694
l told you that
for no reason whatsoever(!)

186
00:13:47,861 --> 00:13:52,324
Did you see the way she ran out of here
the minute she saw me?

187
00:13:52,491 --> 00:13:55,285
The trademark of all your bed mates.

188
00:13:59,164 --> 00:14:03,210
Three months ago? Sam said
they'd been together for six months.

189
00:14:03,376 --> 00:14:07,172
lt looks like
this horse race is on again.

190
00:14:07,339 --> 00:14:13,011
Oh, put the weapon down!
Stop it, Roz! Have you no scruples?

191
00:14:13,178 --> 00:14:16,473
- You slept with your friend's fiancée!
- l didn't know!

192
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:21,519
- You have to tell Sam about this.
- And ruin our relationship and theirs?

193
00:14:21,686 --> 00:14:25,649
l've got to speak to her first.
Hear her side of this story.

194
00:14:25,815 --> 00:14:28,735
There are many reasons
why people have affairs.

195
00:14:28,902 --> 00:14:32,030
Roz, want to get us started?

196
00:14:33,198 --> 00:14:37,077
Maybe they stopped seeing each other
for a couple of weeks.

197
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:40,580
Or he cheated on her
and she was getting even.

198
00:14:40,747 --> 00:14:43,625
Maybe she just found me irresistible.

199
00:14:43,792 --> 00:14:45,835
Oh, yeah, that's it!

200
00:14:46,002 --> 00:14:48,546
You struck gold there.

201
00:14:50,465 --> 00:14:52,509
(Door knocks)

202
00:14:54,052 --> 00:14:58,431
- Hello, Frasier.
- Hello, Sheila. Good to see you again.

203
00:14:58,598 --> 00:15:01,059
Sam, you are one lucky guy!

204
00:15:01,225 --> 00:15:06,105
- He's out getting our plane tickets.
- You have some explaining to do.

205
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:09,692
- OK. Wine?
- No, thank you.

206
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:14,739
l know this doesn't excuse what l did,

207
00:15:14,906 --> 00:15:18,117
but l had no idea that
you were a friend of Sam's.

208
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:24,665
l'm a sexual compulsive.
That's how Sam and l met, in group.

209
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:31,839
That night l spent with you,
l guess l just fell off the wagon.

210
00:15:32,006 --> 00:15:34,675
l felt awful afterwards.

211
00:15:34,842 --> 00:15:40,931
lt ended up being a turning point for me.
That's how it is with addiction.

212
00:15:41,098 --> 00:15:45,686
Before you get better,
you have to hit rock bottom.

213
00:15:48,606 --> 00:15:50,483
Yes. Well...

214
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:54,612
l'm glad
l could be down there for you.

215
00:15:57,198 --> 00:16:01,327
Listen, Frasier, l'm human.
l made a mistake.

216
00:16:01,494 --> 00:16:03,496
Can you understand that?

217
00:16:03,662 --> 00:16:06,040
Of course l can understand.

218
00:16:06,207 --> 00:16:09,793
l've had many patients
that share your affliction,

219
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,004
although only you can hit

220
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:15,799
the emergency button of an elevator
with a stiletto heel.

221
00:16:17,092 --> 00:16:22,765
l love Sam. l'll do everything l can
to make this marriage work.

222
00:16:22,931 --> 00:16:25,976
You seem sincere about this.

223
00:16:26,143 --> 00:16:29,104
l think l can support this marriage.

224
00:16:29,271 --> 00:16:34,026
But if you start to feel yourself slipping,
here's my number.

225
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,615
No, no. So l can help you
as a psychiatrist!

226
00:16:39,781 --> 00:16:41,867
Thank you.

227
00:16:42,784 --> 00:16:47,956
l think it's probably best if we
don't tell Sam about the two of us.

228
00:16:48,123 --> 00:16:50,792
Not that l have a guilty conscience.

229
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:52,836
l'm back.

230
00:16:55,213 --> 00:16:57,674
You all right?

231
00:16:58,258 --> 00:17:00,594
Got a little charley horse.

232
00:17:00,761 --> 00:17:05,390
- Did you get the tickets?
- Yeah, l did. They're right here.

233
00:17:05,557 --> 00:17:11,104
l'm so happy. By this time tomorrow,
we'll be Mr and Mrs Sam Malone.

234
00:17:13,982 --> 00:17:16,485
l want to talk to you about that.

235
00:17:17,694 --> 00:17:22,073
Frasier said something the other day
that really stuck in my mind.

236
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,701
What did l say?

237
00:17:24,868 --> 00:17:28,705
That thing about honesty
being something of something...

238
00:17:28,872 --> 00:17:31,708
lt was pro-honesty.

239
00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:36,755
Being the cornerstone
of a good relationship?

240
00:17:36,921 --> 00:17:39,758
Right. That really stuck in my mind.

241
00:17:41,843 --> 00:17:47,182
- l haven't been honest with you.
- What do you mean?

242
00:17:47,348 --> 00:17:52,103
When we get married, l want us
to have a clean slate, sweetheart.

243
00:17:53,438 --> 00:18:00,111
l hope you can forgive me for this,
but a few months ago, l had a slip.

244
00:18:00,278 --> 00:18:05,533
lt was two slips, but they were
simultaneous, so l'm counting it as one.

245
00:18:08,161 --> 00:18:10,955
Was this after you were engaged?

246
00:18:11,122 --> 00:18:14,000
Actually, it was that night.

247
00:18:16,586 --> 00:18:19,130
l'm so sorry.

248
00:18:19,297 --> 00:18:23,760
lt has not happened since
and l swear it will not happen again.

249
00:18:23,926 --> 00:18:26,429
- l forgive you.
- You do?

250
00:18:26,596 --> 00:18:31,309
l'm relieved. l have something
l need to confess to you.

251
00:18:31,476 --> 00:18:35,146
You're not the only one
who...slipped.

252
00:18:35,313 --> 00:18:38,024
You should have a little privacy.

253
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:43,487
No, you're responsible for getting
us this far. We have no secrets.

254
00:18:43,654 --> 00:18:47,533
All right. Who?

255
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:53,122
That's what makes it so tough.
lt was someone from Cheers.

256
00:18:53,289 --> 00:18:56,751
l parked in a loading zone!

257
00:18:56,917 --> 00:18:59,295
Sam, l slept with Paul.

258
00:18:59,462 --> 00:19:01,672
Paul?

259
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:03,466
- Short?
- Bald?

260
00:19:03,632 --> 00:19:05,676
- Fat?
- Paul?

261
00:19:05,843 --> 00:19:07,887
l didn't say he was good.

262
00:19:10,181 --> 00:19:12,558
All right. l understand that.

263
00:19:12,725 --> 00:19:15,644
You were giving Paul
a break or something.

264
00:19:15,811 --> 00:19:20,149
l can forgive that.
lsn't this all about forgiveness?

265
00:19:20,316 --> 00:19:24,903
OK. You told one, you told one.
We're all even. Let's go eat.

266
00:19:26,071 --> 00:19:30,159
- There was someone else.
- Are we still on this?

267
00:19:31,118 --> 00:19:35,622
l mean, there is honesty
and there's beating a dead horse!

268
00:19:36,498 --> 00:19:41,420
- lt doesn't matter who it is.
- Yes, it does matter.

269
00:19:41,587 --> 00:19:44,590
This one is really embarrassing.

270
00:19:44,756 --> 00:19:47,676
l was lonely, l was desperate

271
00:19:47,843 --> 00:19:52,222
and l'd just been to the eye
doctor and my pupils were dilated.

272
00:19:52,389 --> 00:19:57,060
Oh, Sheila, for God's sake!
l'll tell him. She's trying to say...

273
00:19:57,227 --> 00:19:59,771
lt was Cliff.

274
00:20:04,109 --> 00:20:06,570
l believe she said Cliff.

275
00:20:07,988 --> 00:20:10,157
Cliff?

276
00:20:10,323 --> 00:20:13,577
Cliff? You slept with Cliff?

277
00:20:14,286 --> 00:20:20,041
Cliff! No, that's it!
Wedding's off! Cliff! Oh, God!

278
00:20:22,669 --> 00:20:26,256
Frasier, you've got to help me.
You've got to talk to him.

279
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:31,177
l slept with a woman
who slept with Cliff?

280
00:20:36,808 --> 00:20:39,644
This will be a long flight home.

281
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:46,317
- You made the right decision.
- Yeah, l suppose.

282
00:20:46,484 --> 00:20:49,362
Jeez! Cliff!

283
00:20:50,613 --> 00:20:54,200
You're just using Cliff as the excuse.

284
00:20:54,367 --> 00:20:58,830
There were more compelling reasons
for you to back out of this thing.

285
00:21:00,165 --> 00:21:02,792
No, it was Cliff.

286
00:21:06,504 --> 00:21:10,258
To put this thing aside
once and for all, l...

287
00:21:10,425 --> 00:21:14,721
You're probably the only friend
l have who she didn't sleep with.

288
00:21:20,059 --> 00:21:22,103
Cliff!

289
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:25,982
That is a tough one to swallow, huh?

290
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:31,320
But you proved yourself
ready for a commitment,

291
00:21:31,487 --> 00:21:33,948
even if Sheila wasn't the one.

292
00:21:34,115 --> 00:21:40,246
- l suppose so.
- ln a way, we're both in the same boat.

293
00:21:40,413 --> 00:21:47,003
- What do you mean?
- We've tried, we've failed.

294
00:21:47,169 --> 00:21:49,922
But we'll try again.

295
00:21:50,089 --> 00:21:53,217
We're looking
for a meaningful relationship.

296
00:21:53,384 --> 00:21:56,345
That's the word, ''meaningful''.

297
00:21:56,512 --> 00:22:01,267
- We'll find it though, buddy.
- You bet we will.

298
00:22:02,893 --> 00:22:05,896
Stewardesses usually
hang out at the airport.

299
00:22:06,063 --> 00:22:08,357
That says ''meaningful'' to me.

300
00:22:15,573 --> 00:22:21,245
# Baby, l hear the blues are calling
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

301
00:22:21,412 --> 00:22:22,663
# Mercy!

302
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:29,878
# And maybe l seem a bit confused
Well, maybe...but l got you pegged!

303
00:22:30,045 --> 00:22:35,926
# But l don't know what to do with those
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

304
00:22:36,093 --> 00:22:38,679
