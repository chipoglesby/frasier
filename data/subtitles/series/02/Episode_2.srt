1
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:19,186
We're on in two minutes!

2
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:22,939
l was busy preparing
your schedule for tomorrow.

3
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:28,820
Lunch with the manager, flowers
for your sister-in-law in the hospital.

4
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:31,740
Oh, yes. Maris' facelift.

5
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:36,328
- l didn't know she needed one.
- She doesn't.

6
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:40,916
All she needs is a little sun,
some exercise and a personality.

7
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,588
- What are those?
- Copies of your schedule.

8
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:51,051
Why are you running to the Xerox room
for copies of my schedule?

9
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:54,846
- ls it because of that new intern?
- Eli.

10
00:00:55,972 --> 00:00:59,059
- He's probably all of 1 9!
- That's legal.

11
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,729
Well, koo koo ka choo,
Mrs Robinson.

12
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:09,152
He's so gorgeous you just want to bite
him all over. Haven't you seen him?

13
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:14,699
No. l've been eating out lately.
You're not serious about dating him?

14
00:01:14,824 --> 00:01:20,246
Why can older men date younger
women, but not the other way round?

15
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:24,042
l don't make the rules. l just enjoy them.

16
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,252
You're on.

17
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:32,550
Hello, Seattle.
This is Dr Frasier Crane, KACL 780.

18
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:36,554
l'll be with you for three hours.
Roz, who's our first caller?

19
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:39,766
Linda, calling from a car phone.

20
00:01:39,932 --> 00:01:42,685
Hello, Linda. l'm listening.

21
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:45,897
(Linda) 'My husband and l
are in the middle of a fight.

22
00:01:46,105 --> 00:01:49,025
'We're on our way to the Antique Mart.

23
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:53,404
'We're lost, but he won't stop
and ask for directions.'

24
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:58,200
Yes, this is a common source
of friction among couples.

25
00:01:58,367 --> 00:02:03,581
Some men need to be in control.
They see asking for help as weakness.

26
00:02:03,789 --> 00:02:06,709
'Everybody knows that.
l called to ask

27
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:11,380
'how we get to the Antique Mart
from Cherokee and 1 4th Street.'

28
00:02:11,547 --> 00:02:15,217
(Husband) 'l don't need directions!
l know where l am!'

29
00:02:15,384 --> 00:02:19,138
(Linda) 'We're lost,
Walter. Face it, we're lost.'

30
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:22,558
This isn't normally
the kind of advice l give,

31
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:26,520
but let me see.
l've lived in Seattle most of my life.

32
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:30,983
- l have a map right here.
- No, thanks, l don't need any help.

33
00:02:34,153 --> 00:02:39,575
Eddie, that's disgusting!
Why do animals drag things in?

34
00:02:39,783 --> 00:02:43,704
- What is it? A rat?
- No. A stupid doll.

35
00:02:43,871 --> 00:02:46,373
He carries it everywhere.

36
00:02:46,582 --> 00:02:48,542
(Doorbell)

37
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:51,795
He never did this
before you had him fixed.

38
00:02:52,921 --> 00:02:55,591
- Hello.
- Not at the hospital?

39
00:02:55,758 --> 00:03:01,013
l'm on my way now. Poor Maris.
She has no hospital experience.

40
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:05,851
Except the usual childhood things:
tonsils, adenoids, force-feeding.

41
00:03:08,854 --> 00:03:13,150
- What's wrong with her?
- Nothing. Cosmetic surgery.

42
00:03:13,358 --> 00:03:18,071
Her chin, her lips,
her cheeks, her eyelids...

43
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:22,034
You'd be faster telling us
what she's leaving alone.

44
00:03:23,368 --> 00:03:28,373
- ln my opinion, this is just vanity.
- lt's not vanity, it's insecurity.

45
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:33,336
Women fall victim to our culture's
worship at the altar of beauty.

46
00:03:33,545 --> 00:03:38,300
Women over 40 feel unattractive
if they don't have perfect hair,

47
00:03:38,467 --> 00:03:42,512
porcelain skin, limpid eyes,

48
00:03:42,721 --> 00:03:48,226
pouting lips,
the voluptuous contours of a goddess.

49
00:03:49,394 --> 00:03:52,230
(Sighs wistfully)

50
00:03:55,233 --> 00:03:59,195
(Silence continues)

51
00:03:59,404 --> 00:04:03,241
l'm sorry.
l've forgotten what my point was.

52
00:04:03,408 --> 00:04:08,204
l know just what you mean.
l fell victim to that pressure myself.

53
00:04:08,413 --> 00:04:10,707
- l had a mole removed.
- Where?

54
00:04:10,915 --> 00:04:14,085
Just south of Manchester.

55
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:18,464
- l meant where on your body?
- So did l.

56
00:04:24,178 --> 00:04:27,056
So, what time
is the surgery tomorrow?

57
00:04:27,223 --> 00:04:30,101
First thing in the morning.

58
00:04:30,268 --> 00:04:35,606
l was wondering if l might have your
moral support down at the hospital.

59
00:04:35,773 --> 00:04:40,778
- Sure. No problem.
- Thank you. Well, l'd better be off.

60
00:04:40,945 --> 00:04:45,700
Hey, Niles. lt's not my business,
but how much is this setting you back?

61
00:04:45,867 --> 00:04:49,620
ln the neighbourhood of $25,000.

62
00:04:49,787 --> 00:04:53,958
For an extra five grand, you can
get a new wife from the Philippines.

63
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:08,556
- Ah, Dr Crane.
- Dr Sternstein.

64
00:05:08,723 --> 00:05:13,269
Excuse me... Your wife is recovering,
but it went splendidly.

65
00:05:13,477 --> 00:05:16,147
- You can see her in a few minutes.
- Thank you.

66
00:05:16,313 --> 00:05:19,150
All right, Mrs Patterson.

67
00:05:21,235 --> 00:05:26,282
He's an incredible plastic surgeon.
Did you see that woman?

68
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:30,536
- Mr Patterson is a lucky man.
- Maybe that was Mr Patterson.

69
00:05:35,249 --> 00:05:40,713
Guess whose room l passed by on
the way down the hall: Artie Walsh.

70
00:05:42,423 --> 00:05:46,176
- Dad's old partner?
- Yes, he was in for tests last week.

71
00:05:46,343 --> 00:05:48,637
The results weren't very good.

72
00:05:48,846 --> 00:05:51,890
- Oh, no! l always liked him.
- Yeah.

73
00:05:52,099 --> 00:05:56,270
l remember him inviting us
for weenie roasts when we were kids.

74
00:05:56,437 --> 00:06:01,066
l'm sure he remembers you, too -
asking for a salade niçoise.

75
00:06:05,863 --> 00:06:08,532
- Does Dad know he's here?
- l doubt it.

76
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:12,369
- Think he wants to?
- No. They haven't spoken in years.

77
00:06:12,536 --> 00:06:15,163
Did Artie say why they had a fight?

78
00:06:15,372 --> 00:06:17,416
No, he's tight lipped.

79
00:06:17,624 --> 00:06:21,753
But, with some arm-twisting,
he admitted it was Dad's fault.

80
00:06:22,796 --> 00:06:25,215
You should try the cafeteria here.

81
00:06:25,382 --> 00:06:28,301
They've got a new chef.
He's from Yemen.

82
00:06:29,302 --> 00:06:32,264
So many of the great ones are!

83
00:06:33,223 --> 00:06:37,769
Dad, Artie Walsh is in hospital here.
He's not at all well.

84
00:06:37,978 --> 00:06:42,190
l know. They may have to scoop out
half his intestines.

85
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:46,278
Taste this meat loaf.
lt's just chewy enough.

86
00:06:46,486 --> 00:06:49,155
No, thank you.
Are you going to see him?

87
00:06:49,322 --> 00:06:53,827
- Can't think of any good reason to.
- He was your best friend.

88
00:06:53,994 --> 00:06:56,621
He never came when l took that bullet

89
00:06:56,830 --> 00:07:01,209
and was lying with tubes and drains
from every bodily opening.

90
00:07:01,418 --> 00:07:03,920
At least taste this gravy.

91
00:07:04,754 --> 00:07:08,091
Dad, we're talking about
a few minutes out of your life

92
00:07:08,258 --> 00:07:11,636
to have a little chat with a very sick man.

93
00:07:11,845 --> 00:07:14,764
Now, come on! You'll be glad you did.

94
00:07:14,931 --> 00:07:18,476
That sanctimonious tone
may wow them on the radio,

95
00:07:18,685 --> 00:07:21,020
but it doesn't cut ice with me.

96
00:07:21,187 --> 00:07:25,400
When l say ''no'', l mean it.
l'm not chatting with Artie Walsh.

97
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:30,321
- Artie thought as much.
- What did he say?

98
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:34,993
That you wouldn't have the guts
to see him. Then he sniggered.

99
00:07:35,201 --> 00:07:39,580
l've got news for him!
l've got twice the guts he has!

100
00:07:39,789 --> 00:07:44,127
And after his surgery tomorrow,
l'll have four times the guts!

101
00:07:48,631 --> 00:07:50,925
Artie, it's me again.

102
00:07:52,552 --> 00:07:55,388
- Martin?
- Artie.

103
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:01,018
Dad insisted on rushing over
to see you, didn't you?

104
00:08:01,227 --> 00:08:03,229
Yeah, well...

105
00:08:05,982 --> 00:08:09,110
They said you were
in pretty rocky shape.

106
00:08:09,318 --> 00:08:12,113
They've been saying a lot of things.

107
00:08:17,159 --> 00:08:21,789
- Well, Marty, how's it been going?
- OK.

108
00:08:21,997 --> 00:08:24,583
Good. Small steps.

109
00:08:26,001 --> 00:08:29,672
- Sorry you're laid up.
- Thanks.

110
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:32,133
lt's nice of you to come by.

111
00:08:32,341 --> 00:08:35,261
- Somebody had to be the big man.
- Yeah.

112
00:08:36,345 --> 00:08:38,514
What's that supposed to mean?

113
00:08:38,681 --> 00:08:41,934
- l think you know.
- Why don't you tell me?

114
00:08:42,101 --> 00:08:44,562
l'm being bigger than you were.

115
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:48,232
- With that lousy bullet in your hip?
- lt hurt.

116
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,484
Not enough!

117
00:08:50,693 --> 00:08:55,614
- A bullet might have improved you.
- Be glad it wasn't the butt.

118
00:08:55,781 --> 00:09:00,452
- lt could have caused brain damage.
- You always want the last word.

119
00:09:00,619 --> 00:09:05,332
- l don't want any words with you.
- Too bad! l've got some choice ones.

120
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:11,130
Next time, we'll stay longer.

121
00:09:22,391 --> 00:09:27,437
Stop staring at me like that!
l didn't touch your damned doll.

122
00:09:32,818 --> 00:09:36,822
Look, even if l did,
l did it for your own good.

123
00:09:36,988 --> 00:09:41,284
You were the joke of the park.
Even the poodles were laughing.

124
00:09:45,622 --> 00:09:48,250
Oh, all right.

125
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:50,252
Here.

126
00:09:53,672 --> 00:09:56,591
Got to get that dog a Gl Joe.

127
00:09:59,469 --> 00:10:01,554
Yes, Maris, l'm sure.

128
00:10:01,721 --> 00:10:05,475
No, you can't gain weight
from a glucose lV.

129
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:12,816
No, there's no such thing
as a NutraSweet drip.

130
00:10:18,029 --> 00:10:21,574
Just close your eyes and go to sleep.

131
00:10:21,783 --> 00:10:24,077
Good night, Puppy Toes.

132
00:10:24,285 --> 00:10:26,371
ls everything OK?

133
00:10:26,579 --> 00:10:29,791
No.
She can't get on with her nurses.

134
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:34,128
How can a reputable hospital
hire such troublemakers?

135
00:10:34,337 --> 00:10:39,509
Yes, the Little Sisters of Mercy
have always had that reputation.

136
00:10:43,638 --> 00:10:46,307
Dad, how was your reunion with Artie?

137
00:10:46,474 --> 00:10:48,685
Lousy.

138
00:10:48,893 --> 00:10:52,814
What started this bad blood
between the two of you?

139
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:55,733
He spread a rumour about me at work.

140
00:10:56,901 --> 00:11:00,113
- About what?
- None of your business.

141
00:11:00,321 --> 00:11:03,825
l don't want to talk about it.
Subject closed.

142
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,122
Must have been pretty bad.

143
00:11:10,331 --> 00:11:15,336
- Must have been on the take.
- More likely drugs.

144
00:11:15,503 --> 00:11:19,632
- Drugs, yes. Or sex.
- Or all three.

145
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:23,052
All right,
it was worse than any of that.

146
00:11:23,844 --> 00:11:25,971
He told people...

147
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:28,599
l cried at ''Brian's Song''.

148
00:11:34,021 --> 00:11:37,233
Dear God.
You think that's the kind of thing

149
00:11:37,441 --> 00:11:40,569
that happens
to other people's fathers.

150
00:11:40,778 --> 00:11:44,949
l wasn't crying!
Me and Artie were watching the movie

151
00:11:45,115 --> 00:11:47,826
and l got some pretzel salt in my eye.

152
00:11:49,036 --> 00:11:53,999
Artie told everybody.
l became the joke of the department.

153
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:59,296
Other cops left Kleenex on my desk.
They called me Boo-hoo Crane.

154
00:12:00,631 --> 00:12:03,884
l can understand
your being upset with him,

155
00:12:04,051 --> 00:12:07,304
but what's he so cheesed off
with you for?

156
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:11,433
Well, l...

157
00:12:11,642 --> 00:12:16,104
l guess l let something slip
about the size of his wife's behind.

158
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:21,276
- l beg your pardon?
- She's got this gigantic rear end.

159
00:12:21,485 --> 00:12:24,863
Looks like she's shoplifting pillows.

160
00:12:31,912 --> 00:12:35,123
You felt compelled
to share that with him?

161
00:12:35,332 --> 00:12:39,961
For 20 years, l tried not to,
then, one day, l let my guard down.

162
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:44,216
We were coming into work,
and he says, ''How's the wife?''

163
00:12:44,424 --> 00:12:49,763
And l said, ''At least she doesn't
have an arse the size of Albuquerque.''

164
00:12:52,265 --> 00:12:57,646
A 20-year relationship ruined
because of a little name-calling?

165
00:12:57,854 --> 00:13:00,190
No, there's more to it than that.

166
00:13:00,357 --> 00:13:03,443
Artie always had to have the last word.

167
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:07,739
He couldn't leave well alone.

168
00:13:08,615 --> 00:13:11,493
Couldn't let sleeping dogs lie.

169
00:13:14,454 --> 00:13:18,291
You'd think it was all over,
then he'd start again.

170
00:13:19,292 --> 00:13:21,294
Can we drop this?

171
00:13:21,461 --> 00:13:26,508
l've got better things to do than
sit in a hospital room taking abuse.

172
00:13:26,716 --> 00:13:29,385
Oh, God, l'm due back with Maris.

173
00:13:31,805 --> 00:13:36,935
- l'll be sleeping at the hospital tonight.
- Why?

174
00:13:37,143 --> 00:13:42,148
Maris' doctor feels it soothes the
patient to copy the home environment.

175
00:13:42,315 --> 00:13:46,945
So l slipped a gun under her pillow
and got a room across the hall.

176
00:13:55,828 --> 00:13:59,207
We'd better say a prayer
for the night nurse.

177
00:13:59,415 --> 00:14:05,421
lt's a shame your father and his
friend can't let bygones be bygones.

178
00:14:05,588 --> 00:14:10,843
- l don't know what else to do.
- Maybe if l had a go at it.

179
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:14,263
l've come to have
a pretty good understanding

180
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:18,226
of how the Crane mind works.
When it works.

181
00:14:19,936 --> 00:14:23,898
- About your partner...
- l don't want to talk about it.

182
00:14:24,106 --> 00:14:27,693
No, l just wanted to tell you
l'm on your side.

183
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:32,198
- l say good riddance to bad rubbish.
- Damn right.

184
00:14:32,365 --> 00:14:34,950
You can't have had any good times.

185
00:14:35,117 --> 00:14:39,121
There weren't many.
Occasionally, we'd go fishing.

186
00:14:39,288 --> 00:14:42,666
- That's not much fun.
- Not the way l did it.

187
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:45,461
But Artie decided he'd teach me.

188
00:14:45,628 --> 00:14:49,048
He even bought this beat-up old boat.

189
00:14:49,215 --> 00:14:52,760
He said after we retired,
we'd get more use out of it.

190
00:14:52,968 --> 00:14:56,305
lt seems pushy
to foist his interests on you.

191
00:14:56,472 --> 00:15:00,559
Oh, it wasn't so bad.
l remember once l bust my hump

192
00:15:00,726 --> 00:15:04,063
reeling in what turned out
to be an old slipper.

193
00:15:04,229 --> 00:15:09,318
You know what Artie did? Unhooked it
and threw it on the barbecue.

194
00:15:10,319 --> 00:15:13,781
Maybe he wasn't
such a bad guy after all.

195
00:15:16,492 --> 00:15:22,539
Maybe you're right. l listen to myself talk
and l sound like a big fool.

196
00:15:23,665 --> 00:15:28,128
- Thanks, Daphne. You opened my eyes.
- l thought l might.

197
00:15:28,337 --> 00:15:32,799
l'm going to go to that hospital,
buy him a big stuffed animal,

198
00:15:33,008 --> 00:15:36,261
throw my arms around him
and never let him go.

199
00:15:40,265 --> 00:15:44,144
You really are a hateful old sod,
aren't you?

200
00:15:44,353 --> 00:15:47,022
Come on, Eddie! Time for your walk.

201
00:15:49,274 --> 00:15:51,693
Hello? Yes, it is.

202
00:15:53,695 --> 00:15:55,822
Oh, l see.

203
00:15:56,031 --> 00:15:59,618
l guess it isn't really a shock,
considering.

204
00:16:00,535 --> 00:16:04,080
Yes. l'm sure they did
everything they could.

205
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:07,292
Thank you.

206
00:16:08,877 --> 00:16:12,589
- Who was that?
- We can talk about it later, Dad.

207
00:16:15,216 --> 00:16:18,094
- ls everything OK?
- Why do you ask?

208
00:16:19,387 --> 00:16:25,018
l hear you say ''l'm sorry'' and such
like. lt's natural to be concerned.

209
00:16:25,226 --> 00:16:27,395
- You thought it was about Artie.
- No!

210
00:16:27,562 --> 00:16:30,315
- Yes, you did.
- So what if l did?

211
00:16:30,482 --> 00:16:33,318
lt proves you still care about him.

212
00:16:33,485 --> 00:16:38,990
All right, suppose l do feel bad about
this fight. What the hell can l do?

213
00:16:39,157 --> 00:16:43,995
That's up to you.
l could drive you to the hospital.

214
00:16:46,247 --> 00:16:49,042
l don't need you. l can drive myself.

215
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:53,504
You can't. That was your mechanic.
Your transmission's dead.

216
00:17:05,767 --> 00:17:08,436
(TV gunfight)

217
00:17:11,522 --> 00:17:15,151
- Artie...
- Oh, Jeez!

218
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:20,114
- You guys got off on the wrong foot.
- All right. l'll handle this.

219
00:17:22,783 --> 00:17:24,869
Artie...

220
00:17:27,371 --> 00:17:31,208
- Will you turn the TV off?
- l'll turn it down.

221
00:17:34,712 --> 00:17:40,134
Listen, Artie, l'm sorry about some
of those things l said earlier, OK?

222
00:17:41,218 --> 00:17:43,054
Maybe all of them.

223
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:47,266
l was steamed that you never came
to see me in hospital.

224
00:17:47,475 --> 00:17:51,520
l didn't come by because
l didn't think you'd want see me.

225
00:17:51,687 --> 00:17:53,731
Of course l wanted to!

226
00:17:54,815 --> 00:17:59,111
- That's what my wife said.
- Oh, yeah. Loretta.

227
00:18:10,164 --> 00:18:12,207
lt's nice of you to come.

228
00:18:12,416 --> 00:18:15,586
lt's not easy for someone
as stubborn as you.

229
00:18:15,753 --> 00:18:20,716
Me stubborn? l'm not the one
who always has to have the last...

230
00:18:23,093 --> 00:18:26,597
No, you're right, Artie. l am stubborn.

231
00:18:27,764 --> 00:18:30,392
- And it wasn't easy.
- Thanks, Martin.

232
00:18:31,518 --> 00:18:34,104
We have a few things to talk about,

233
00:18:34,271 --> 00:18:38,275
so if you'll just wait outside,
it'll be a lot easier.

234
00:18:38,442 --> 00:18:40,903
Anything l said would be irrelevant.

235
00:18:41,111 --> 00:18:47,034
As a therapist, you learn once things
are working, anything else would be...

236
00:18:52,622 --> 00:18:56,084
What's an old cop like you
doing in a joint like this?

237
00:18:56,293 --> 00:18:59,796
Believe me,
l didn't expect to end like this.

238
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:03,842
End? You'll be out raising hell
before you know it.

239
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:08,889
l don't know. The doctors
aren't tossing their hats in the air.

240
00:19:09,055 --> 00:19:12,434
My sons are doctors.
They don't know nothing.

241
00:19:12,642 --> 00:19:15,729
You've got to get out of here.

242
00:19:15,896 --> 00:19:19,065
We've got a lot of lost time
to make up for.

243
00:19:19,232 --> 00:19:23,653
- You still got that stupid boat?
- Yeah. l hung on to it.

244
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:27,032
We'll sink that damn thing yet.

245
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:31,453
Hey, Artie, remember the time
you barbecued the slipper?

246
00:19:31,661 --> 00:19:35,832
Stuff always tastes better
when you catch it yourself.

247
00:19:41,838 --> 00:19:47,093
- What are you doing here?
- l got Artie and Dad talking again.

248
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:51,723
l had to resort to some cheap,
manipulative pseudo-psychology.

249
00:19:51,931 --> 00:19:54,809
Always go to your strengths.

250
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:01,983
Looks like you've bought out
the entire gift shop for Maris.

251
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:05,528
This isn't for Maris. lt's for her nurses.

252
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:12,452
They're meeting to discuss her
and l gather hospital strikes are ugly.

253
00:20:14,454 --> 00:20:18,791
- Visiting hours are over.
- Thank you. l'll go round up Dad.

254
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,880
Excuse me. Do you work on
my wife's floor, Mrs Maris Crane?

255
00:20:25,131 --> 00:20:27,383
Yes, l do.

256
00:20:27,592 --> 00:20:30,636
l'd like you to have these chocolates.

257
00:20:31,554 --> 00:20:35,808
- l'm on the night shift.
- And this lovely watch.

258
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,028
Dad, it's time to go.

259
00:20:47,236 --> 00:20:51,907
What? You get another phone call
about your dad's transmission?

260
00:20:52,074 --> 00:20:55,661
- Your dad told me about that.
- All l was doing was...

261
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:58,581
l know what you were doing.
Thanks, kid.

262
00:20:59,999 --> 00:21:02,042
- See you soon.
- Sure.

263
00:21:03,502 --> 00:21:05,504
OK, we've got a deal.

264
00:21:05,671 --> 00:21:09,675
When you get out of this joint,
you give me fishing lessons.

265
00:21:09,842 --> 00:21:12,219
- lf l get out.
- When you get out.

266
00:21:12,428 --> 00:21:15,681
You can't have the last word
on this one.

267
00:21:17,641 --> 00:21:19,852
- See you, Marty.
- See you, Art.

268
00:21:20,019 --> 00:21:21,603
- Bye.
- Bye.

269
00:21:21,812 --> 00:21:23,605
Take care.

270
00:21:25,858 --> 00:21:27,693
Take care.

271
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:29,987
Stay loose!

272
00:21:35,951 --> 00:21:37,953
See you, Artie!

273
00:21:59,391 --> 00:22:01,435
(Artie ) See you, Marty.

274
00:22:12,779 --> 00:22:18,451
# Hey baby, l hear the blues are calling
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

275
00:22:18,618 --> 00:22:20,036
# Oh, my!

276
00:22:20,245 --> 00:22:27,168
# And maybe l seem a bit confused
Well, maybe, but l got you pegged

277
00:22:27,377 --> 00:22:32,924
# But l don't know what to do with those
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

278
00:22:33,091 --> 00:22:35,635
# They're calling again #

279
00:22:35,844 --> 00:22:38,555
Good night!
