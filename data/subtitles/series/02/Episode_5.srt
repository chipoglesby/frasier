1
00:00:09,517 --> 00:00:13,730
(Frasier) Ah, yes,
another beautiful Saturday night.

2
00:00:13,897 --> 00:00:18,068
The moon is full.
The city lights are twinkling.

3
00:00:18,234 --> 00:00:20,570
Lovers steal kisses in the park.

4
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:24,240
And here...

5
00:00:24,407 --> 00:00:26,451
...chez Crane...

6
00:00:27,702 --> 00:00:30,830
...my father and his assistant
sit hunched

7
00:00:30,997 --> 00:00:34,584
over 20-year-old photographs
of a murdered hooker.

8
00:00:35,502 --> 00:00:38,505
Life is a banquet.

9
00:00:38,671 --> 00:00:41,382
l enjoy looking at this old case.

10
00:00:41,549 --> 00:00:46,054
Just because you have no plans,
don't spoil our harmless fun.

11
00:00:46,221 --> 00:00:50,516
We Brits do love a grisly murder
and a nice hot cup of tea.

12
00:00:51,434 --> 00:00:54,270
Daphne, l'm busy, so if you don't mind...

13
00:00:54,437 --> 00:00:57,315
l didn't know l was bothering you.

14
00:00:57,482 --> 00:00:59,734
Sorry. lt's this damn case.

15
00:00:59,901 --> 00:01:04,781
The answer to who murdered Helen
is right here. l just can't see it.

16
00:01:04,947 --> 00:01:09,577
You're obsessing. You stare
at these grisly pictures endlessly.

17
00:01:09,744 --> 00:01:11,788
Let's go and see a movie.

18
00:01:11,954 --> 00:01:13,998
- No.
- Pizza?

19
00:01:14,165 --> 00:01:16,209
- Nah.
- Let's get tattooed.

20
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:21,422
Oh! This is ridiculous!
lt's a beautiful night.

21
00:01:21,589 --> 00:01:24,258
l'm going to take a nice long walk.

22
00:01:24,425 --> 00:01:26,928
And l'm not going by myself.

23
00:01:31,807 --> 00:01:36,437
He likes the rhododendrons
on the north side of the park.

24
00:01:40,691 --> 00:01:44,403
(Woman) 'Dr Crane,
thanks to your advice,

25
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:46,655
'l've conquered my fear of heights.

26
00:01:46,822 --> 00:01:50,326
'l took it slowly,
gradually going higher and higher

27
00:01:50,493 --> 00:01:55,497
'until here l am, having lunch
at the top of the Space Needle.'

28
00:01:55,664 --> 00:02:00,127
- Marjorie, l'm so proud of you.
- (Marjorie ) 'When l think of how l...'

29
00:02:00,294 --> 00:02:02,338
(Marjorie screams)

30
00:02:02,504 --> 00:02:05,299
- What happened?
- 'l looked down.'

31
00:02:05,466 --> 00:02:11,180
Look at your luncheon companions
or your menu, but don't look down.

32
00:02:11,347 --> 00:02:13,349
You're only feeding your fears.

33
00:02:13,557 --> 00:02:16,018
'Maybe l'm not ready
for a window table.'

34
00:02:16,185 --> 00:02:20,606
No, no, of course you are.
You can beat this thing.

35
00:02:20,773 --> 00:02:23,734
'You're right.
l can, Dr Crane, if l just...'

36
00:02:23,901 --> 00:02:25,611
(Screams)

37
00:02:25,778 --> 00:02:28,655
- Do not look down!
- 'No, l didn't.

38
00:02:28,822 --> 00:02:31,033
'My cheque just came.'

39
00:02:34,494 --> 00:02:39,374
Well, Marjorie, we're out of time now.
Call me tomorrow, will you?

40
00:02:40,459 --> 00:02:43,879
That's it for today.
Stay tuned for Bulldog Briscoe.

41
00:02:44,046 --> 00:02:48,175
This is Dr Frasier Crane,
KACL 780 Talk Radio.

42
00:02:49,134 --> 00:02:51,178
- Hey, Doc.
- Bulldog.

43
00:02:51,345 --> 00:02:53,722
l caught some of your show today.

44
00:02:53,889 --> 00:02:56,892
lf that whining chick called me,
l'd say,

45
00:02:57,059 --> 00:03:01,146
''lf you don't want people snapping
your bra, don't wear one.''

46
00:03:03,607 --> 00:03:05,859
Brilliant in its simplicity.

47
00:03:07,652 --> 00:03:10,071
How does this sound, hard body?

48
00:03:10,238 --> 00:03:13,533
You, me, Sonics, Knicks, tonight?

49
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:17,037
l'm already going.
l have season tickets.

50
00:03:17,203 --> 00:03:22,000
- We could get together afterwards.
- Only if l smash into your car.

51
00:03:22,167 --> 00:03:26,713
Why do the ones that want it the most
put up the biggest struggle?

52
00:03:28,089 --> 00:03:30,884
Because, when l do finally give in,

53
00:03:31,051 --> 00:03:34,220
l want us to enjoy it all the more.

54
00:03:36,055 --> 00:03:40,685
lf l'm not distracted by the fact
that every man on earth has died.

55
00:03:44,063 --> 00:03:46,691
Almost had her there.

56
00:03:46,858 --> 00:03:49,777
Yes, it could have gone either way.

57
00:03:49,944 --> 00:03:52,822
Well, l can get those any time l want.

58
00:03:52,989 --> 00:03:56,868
- Hello, Frasier.
- Bulldog, my brother, Niles.

59
00:03:57,035 --> 00:04:00,580
- Niles, this is Bulldog Briscoe.
- Just the man.

60
00:04:00,747 --> 00:04:03,833
You can tell me why
none of the local media

61
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,753
carry the lvy League squash standings.

62
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:12,550
Whoa! Another one just like you!

63
00:04:12,717 --> 00:04:15,803
Some gypsy
put a curse on your family?

64
00:04:17,388 --> 00:04:21,642
- See you later, Miles.
- lt's Niles.

65
00:04:21,809 --> 00:04:23,895
Like it matters.

66
00:04:26,981 --> 00:04:31,193
Are you ready for our boys' night out
at Le Cochon Noir?

67
00:04:33,863 --> 00:04:39,452
Yes. But, Niles, l've been wondering.
Would you mind if Dad joined us?

68
00:04:39,618 --> 00:04:42,913
Last time we took Dad
to a four-star restaurant,

69
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,584
he had a miserable time
and the restaurant lost a star.

70
00:04:48,127 --> 00:04:53,132
l want to get him out. He's on one
of his weeping lotus binges again.

71
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:58,596
We've taken him everywhere
from the Arboretum to the Zen Garden.

72
00:04:58,762 --> 00:05:01,891
Wait!
The Zen Garden is at the Arboretum.

73
00:05:02,057 --> 00:05:04,810
Have we only taken him one place?

74
00:05:06,353 --> 00:05:10,232
- Oh, Niles, the basketball game!
- Basketball?

75
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:12,901
Yes. l can get another ticket.

76
00:05:13,068 --> 00:05:17,614
lmagine how excited Dad will be
to go to a game with his two sons.

77
00:05:17,781 --> 00:05:20,659
lt's the archetypal male bonding ritual.

78
00:05:20,826 --> 00:05:24,747
Couldn't we just go into the woods
and kill something?

79
00:05:25,748 --> 00:05:29,376
- All right.
- You can see the Tacoma Dome.

80
00:05:29,543 --> 00:05:32,963
l've seen it.
They had a home show there once.

81
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:37,134
That's where l got the idea
to stencil the Welsh dresser.

82
00:05:37,301 --> 00:05:39,845
l'm a teamster compared to you.

83
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:48,478
(Man) Peanuts! Peanuts!

84
00:05:49,938 --> 00:05:52,357
Niles, the game's that way!

85
00:05:52,524 --> 00:05:57,112
l'm calculating our escape route
in case of fire or unrest.

86
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:00,115
- Maris taught me.
- You love her, don't you?

87
00:06:00,282 --> 00:06:03,827
- Yes, l do. Why?
- lt helps to know that.

88
00:06:03,994 --> 00:06:09,332
Here we are.
One beer and two glasses of wine.

89
00:06:09,499 --> 00:06:13,920
l'm sure it's good. They opened
a fresh box when they poured it.

90
00:06:14,087 --> 00:06:16,506
You ought to be drinking beer.

91
00:06:16,673 --> 00:06:21,886
Dad, l only drink beer when l eat
German food, which is to say never!

92
00:06:22,887 --> 00:06:28,018
- Did you notice the facilities?
- As you feared: communal urinals.

93
00:06:28,184 --> 00:06:31,021
What do l do about my shy kidneys?

94
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:34,691
- Aren't these great seats?
- Yeah.

95
00:06:36,234 --> 00:06:39,779
- What's the matter?
- Nothing. Lend me your pen.

96
00:06:39,946 --> 00:06:44,451
- What for?
- A note about that ballistics report.

97
00:06:44,617 --> 00:06:47,996
We came here
to get your mind off the case.

98
00:06:48,163 --> 00:06:52,125
l've done some reading.
lt seems the key for the Sonics

99
00:06:52,292 --> 00:06:56,588
is to stop Starks from penetrating
and dumping the ball off.

100
00:06:56,754 --> 00:07:01,134
''Stop Starks''? That sounds funny:
stop Starks, stop Starks...

101
00:07:01,301 --> 00:07:03,136
Shut up!

102
00:07:04,345 --> 00:07:08,558
- lt makes no sense!
- l'm just quoting some sports writer.

103
00:07:08,725 --> 00:07:14,147
No, Helen was tall, yet the bullet
entered on a downward trajectory.

104
00:07:14,313 --> 00:07:18,735
Dad, please try to participate.
Look, they're starting a wave!

105
00:07:22,697 --> 00:07:27,743
That was fun, wasn't it?
There's a peanut guy. Peanut!

106
00:07:28,619 --> 00:07:30,663
How dare you?

107
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:34,375
Niles... Stop it!

108
00:07:34,542 --> 00:07:39,005
He's pelting me with peanuts
See that tray! He's come prepared!

109
00:07:39,171 --> 00:07:41,257
Stop it! That is for me!

110
00:07:41,424 --> 00:07:45,136
- l got to make a call.
- Not about the case?

111
00:07:45,302 --> 00:07:48,139
- Yes.
- You've been working on it for years.

112
00:07:48,305 --> 00:07:50,349
Why are you so obsessed now?

113
00:07:50,516 --> 00:07:55,479
l promised her mother that,
however long it took, l'd find the killer.

114
00:07:55,646 --> 00:08:01,527
She called me last week. She's an
old lady living in a home somewhere.

115
00:08:01,694 --> 00:08:04,655
She doesn't have a lot longer to go.

116
00:08:04,822 --> 00:08:07,992
lt spurred me on to get it solved.

117
00:08:08,158 --> 00:08:12,329
So l appreciate your bringing me here
but l've got to make this call.

118
00:08:12,496 --> 00:08:14,999
OK, Dad. l understand.

119
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:21,338
Boy, the traffic tonight is murder.
Hey, pal, what's the score?

120
00:08:21,505 --> 00:08:23,632
''West Side Story''.

121
00:08:29,513 --> 00:08:33,475
This picture of the crime scene
has always bugged me.

122
00:08:33,642 --> 00:08:36,895
The way Helen's written ''help''.
Why?

123
00:08:37,062 --> 00:08:42,526
Well, l suppose the word ''howdy''
would have been a bit too cheery.

124
00:08:42,693 --> 00:08:48,448
lt makes no sense. Anybody who could
read it could see her lying there.

125
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:54,413
- Evening, Dad.
- Thanks again for the ball game.

126
00:08:54,579 --> 00:08:58,625
lt was a pleasure. l'm sorry
you couldn't join us for dinner.

127
00:08:58,792 --> 00:09:02,254
Le Cochon Noir
gave us a fabulous dinner.

128
00:09:02,421 --> 00:09:06,800
lt was marred only by the lack
of even one outstanding cognac

129
00:09:06,967 --> 00:09:09,010
<i>on their carte des digestifs.</i>

130
00:09:09,177 --> 00:09:11,638
But think of it this way.

131
00:09:11,805 --> 00:09:16,143
What's the one thing better
than an exquisite meal?

132
00:09:16,309 --> 00:09:18,353
An exquisite meal

133
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:22,148
with one tiny flaw
we can pick at all night.

134
00:09:23,149 --> 00:09:26,319
Quite right.
To impossible standards!

135
00:09:30,532 --> 00:09:35,161
- So, Dad, any progress on the case?
- Nah, l'm beat.

136
00:09:35,328 --> 00:09:40,625
Sometimes it's better to start fresh
in the morning. Good night.

137
00:09:40,792 --> 00:09:43,628
Brush your teeth, say your prayers.

138
00:09:43,795 --> 00:09:47,424
l used to say that
when you were kids, didn't l?

139
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:49,968
- No, you didn't.
- Oh.

140
00:09:51,636 --> 00:09:53,888
- l meant to.
- We knew that.

141
00:09:55,515 --> 00:09:58,059
- Hello.
- Hello, Daphne!

142
00:09:58,226 --> 00:10:01,646
- How was dinner?
- Fine except for one tiny flaw.

143
00:10:01,813 --> 00:10:05,191
Oh, just the way you like it.

144
00:10:07,068 --> 00:10:09,195
l see you're intrigued.

145
00:10:09,362 --> 00:10:11,864
lt's a while since l've gone over it.

146
00:10:12,031 --> 00:10:16,786
- Who are these guys?
- The principal players in the drama.

147
00:10:16,953 --> 00:10:20,707
That's Detective Shelby,
the cop who found the body.

148
00:10:20,873 --> 00:10:23,543
Who is this menacing monobrow?

149
00:10:23,709 --> 00:10:27,713
Robitaille, the logger,
an ex-boyfriend of Helen's.

150
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,967
Every few months,
they'd disappear together.

151
00:10:31,175 --> 00:10:33,219
He's the murderer.

152
00:10:33,386 --> 00:10:35,763
- He's got an airtight alibi.
- What?

153
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:38,849
He was killing somebody else
at the time.

154
00:10:40,268 --> 00:10:43,854
But you have to admit
this case has it all:

155
00:10:44,021 --> 00:10:48,859
sex, greed, jealousy, revenge,
a monkey, hatred, deception...

156
00:10:49,026 --> 00:10:51,612
Wait, wait, wait! A monkey?

157
00:10:51,779 --> 00:10:56,659
This is a snapshot of the murder
victim with her pet monkey, Coco.

158
00:10:56,826 --> 00:11:01,455
He was given to her by
another boyfriend, Clive Brisbane.

159
00:11:01,622 --> 00:11:04,500
- Why wasn't Brisbane a suspect?
- He was.

160
00:11:04,667 --> 00:11:08,921
Witnesses saw him at the racetrack
at the time of the murder.

161
00:11:09,088 --> 00:11:13,384
- Brisbane the animal trainer?
- Yes. Brisbane's Amazing Apes.

162
00:11:13,551 --> 00:11:17,513
They opened in Las Vegas
for Engelbert Humperdinck.

163
00:11:18,722 --> 00:11:23,727
You forget there was a time
when Las Vegas wasn't tacky like now.

164
00:11:25,521 --> 00:11:29,608
l once caught his act
on a trip to Vegas during college.

165
00:11:29,775 --> 00:11:31,819
Those apes were amazing!

166
00:11:31,985 --> 00:11:36,573
They staged a tableau
of Washington crossing the Delaware

167
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:42,746
and then shot suction-cup arrows
at Brisbane's assistant's derrière.

168
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:51,505
You know...there is a way
that Brisbane could be the killer

169
00:11:51,672 --> 00:11:54,841
and still have
his horse track alibi hold up.

170
00:11:55,968 --> 00:11:58,512
Daphne, Niles...

171
00:11:59,429 --> 00:12:02,975
l present you with...
the killer!

172
00:12:07,562 --> 00:12:11,650
- A monkey was the trigger man?
- Play along with me.

173
00:12:11,817 --> 00:12:14,945
They can shoot arrows.
Why not a gun?

174
00:12:15,112 --> 00:12:20,283
- Why would Brisbane have her killed?
- Because, because...

175
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:24,037
- She jilted him for someone else!
- Robitaille!

176
00:12:24,204 --> 00:12:27,499
- Exactly! We've done it!
- You've done it!

177
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:30,877
Yes, but you were standing
very close by.

178
00:12:31,044 --> 00:12:33,922
Wait a minute. Are we saying here

179
00:12:34,089 --> 00:12:37,300
that a murder was committed
by a monkey?

180
00:12:37,926 --> 00:12:40,637
lt's not so very far fetched!

181
00:12:41,721 --> 00:12:46,893
lt could be Brisbane's homage
to Poe's ''Murders in the Rue Morgue''.

182
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:50,188
lt's about a murderous orang-utan
in Paris.

183
00:12:50,355 --> 00:12:53,191
Wait till we tell Dad. Dad!

184
00:12:53,358 --> 00:12:56,653
No, Niles, wait! lt's still just a theory.

185
00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:03,117
And how will Dad feel, knowing we've
cracked a case he couldn't solve?

186
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,454
Oh, dear. You're right.

187
00:13:06,621 --> 00:13:11,709
Wait! lt's serendipity that l stumbled
into this. lt can happen again.

188
00:13:11,876 --> 00:13:16,214
l'll rearrange the photos
so that Dad will see the connection.

189
00:13:16,381 --> 00:13:21,928
All right, we've got Coco,
the gun and...Helen.

190
00:13:22,095 --> 00:13:25,890
What is it? Oh, no, Frasier!
What are you doing?

191
00:13:26,057 --> 00:13:30,353
No, no. l've got these all set out
the way l want them.

192
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,563
This one goes up...

193
00:13:35,149 --> 00:13:37,819
l'll be damned!

194
00:13:38,736 --> 00:13:40,780
Something wrong?

195
00:13:41,989 --> 00:13:45,701
- Look at that!
- What?

196
00:13:45,868 --> 00:13:49,914
l never thought it would leap out
and bite me like this.

197
00:13:50,081 --> 00:13:52,249
l may have solved this case.

198
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:54,335
- You have?
- Wonderful!

199
00:13:54,543 --> 00:13:58,756
No. Don't get too excited.
This is kind of far fetched.

200
00:13:58,923 --> 00:14:02,426
lt's a long shot,
but it's beginning to make sense.

201
00:14:02,593 --> 00:14:05,012
- Lay it out.
- Guys, please.

202
00:14:05,179 --> 00:14:08,265
Give me a little privacy.
l've got to think.

203
00:14:08,432 --> 00:14:12,353
- No problem.
- l was just going to bed. Night, all.

204
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,522
Good night, Daphne.

205
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:19,777
Do you see the sparkle in his eye?
He's like a little kid at Christmas.

206
00:14:19,944 --> 00:14:23,405
What happened
to my entry-wound close-ups?

207
00:14:23,572 --> 00:14:26,951
# Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la #

208
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,877
- Hello. ls Dad home?
- Nope.

209
00:14:37,044 --> 00:14:40,297
l haven't seen him
since he knocked me up.

210
00:14:52,017 --> 00:14:55,938
- What?
- Knocked me up. Woke me up.

211
00:14:56,104 --> 00:15:00,150
lt's an English expression.
What does it mean here?

212
00:15:01,777 --> 00:15:03,946
Oh, something else.

213
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:07,199
You'd definitely be awake for it, though.

214
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:13,497
He went to the station
to present his theory.

215
00:15:13,664 --> 00:15:18,251
l wish he hadn't. l've been
turning it over in my mind all day.

216
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:22,339
The more l think about it,
the goofier it sounds.

217
00:15:22,506 --> 00:15:26,635
l mean, a monkey! l hope they
didn't laugh him out of the station.

218
00:15:26,802 --> 00:15:30,555
lt'd be one hell of an end
to a 30-year career.

219
00:15:30,722 --> 00:15:35,894
Now, now, Dr Crane. lt's not the most
outlandish theory in the world.

220
00:15:36,061 --> 00:15:39,940
You're right. Could have said
it was a trained giraffe.

221
00:15:41,358 --> 00:15:45,070
l suppose he killed her
by spitting the bullet at her,

222
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:48,448
thus explaining
the downward trajectory.

223
00:15:50,075 --> 00:15:52,077
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

224
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:55,747
- Heard anything from the station?
- Not yet.

225
00:15:55,914 --> 00:15:59,959
l was afraid of that.
l knew my theory was iffy,

226
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:03,755
but when l told the guys,
they looked at me like l'd lost my mind.

227
00:16:03,922 --> 00:16:06,591
- They didn't ridicule you?
- No.

228
00:16:06,758 --> 00:16:09,719
They treat old-timers with respect.

229
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:11,930
They said, ''l'll check it out'',

230
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:16,768
like l used to when some nut came in
with aluminium foil in his hat,

231
00:16:16,935 --> 00:16:21,064
claiming the Martians
were stealing his brainwaves.

232
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:25,902
- l'm sorry.
- l don't know what l was thinking of.

233
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:31,741
l've been trying to figure out how
l came up with such a half-assed theory.

234
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:36,454
Dad... lt wasn't your fault. l did it.

235
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:41,876
You killed her?

236
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:47,757
No, but l planted that ridiculous idea
in your head.

237
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:52,553
Remember when you were upset
l was rearranging your pictures?

238
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:57,892
l rearranged them so that you would
come to the same conclusion l did.

239
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:03,189
- So you had the idea first?
- l feel terrible.

240
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:06,901
Don't blame yourself.
You put the foil on my hat,

241
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:10,071
but l walked into the station wearing it.

242
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:11,947
(Doorbell)

243
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:14,158
l'll get it.

244
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:18,829
- Oh.
- Hiya, Marty.

245
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:23,626
Hey, Frank! Frasier, Daphne,
you remember Frank from the precinct.

246
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:28,005
- Marty, we've got to talk.
- About that theory of mine...

247
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:31,216
- What were you thinking?
- l know.

248
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:34,053
l feel so stupid wasting your time.

249
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:38,390
lt cost us a whole afternoon
and five detectives' time.

250
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:41,435
All we've got to show for it is...

251
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:45,272
- We got the bastard!
- l was right?

252
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:48,776
You don't believe me,
ask these derelicts.

253
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:53,697
- Way to go, Marty!
- Good to see you.

254
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:58,869
Marty, you've still got it.
And it only took you 20 years.

255
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:03,248
- Mr Crane, l'm so proud of you!
- That's wonderful!

256
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:05,459
Oh, that's suede!

257
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:12,090
- So Marty, how did you do it?
- l thought it was Robitaille,

258
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:17,012
and then l thought maybe
it was Brisbane, but l was wrong.

259
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:21,224
How did you finally decide
it was Detective Shelby?

260
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:24,144
That picture kept bugging me.

261
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:26,772
Why was she trying to write ''help''?

262
00:18:26,938 --> 00:18:31,276
Then it came to me: she wanted
to write the killer's name, Shelby.

263
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:36,198
She died before she'd done the ''b'',
someone kicked dirt over the ''s''.

264
00:18:36,364 --> 00:18:40,452
You nailed him.
We interrogated him. He cracked.

265
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:48,960
Sorry l doubted you, but you also
wondered if a monkey could murder.

266
00:18:49,127 --> 00:18:54,215
l may have momentarily doubted it,
but l have to learn to trust my gift.

267
00:18:56,176 --> 00:19:01,514
- Did you call the girl's mother?
- No, you do it. You solved this.

268
00:19:01,681 --> 00:19:07,479
l can't take all the credit for it,
right, Frasier? Get over here.

269
00:19:07,645 --> 00:19:11,858
- Oh, now, Dad...
- Don't be shy. l'm proud of you!

270
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:17,530
l was a cop for 30 years and it took
my son with his PhD mind to crack it.

271
00:19:17,697 --> 00:19:21,159
Plus l was standing next to him
at the time.

272
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:25,330
- So, tell us about it, Frasier.
- Oh, no!

273
00:19:25,496 --> 00:19:28,541
- Come on!
- Well, all right, then.

274
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:33,421
l hate to toot my own horn,
but if it'll make Dad happy...

275
00:19:33,588 --> 00:19:35,882
lt was my expertise
in human behaviour

276
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:39,469
combined with enthusiasm
for the Rwandan gorilla,

277
00:19:39,635 --> 00:19:41,304
that set me thinking about the monkey.

278
00:19:45,391 --> 00:19:50,229
- l'm not sure l'm following you.
- l'm going too fast. l'll go slower.

279
00:19:50,396 --> 00:19:54,275
l figured out that,
if Brisbane could teach a monkey

280
00:19:54,442 --> 00:19:56,527
to impersonate Washington,

281
00:19:56,694 --> 00:20:00,114
then he could teach a monkey
to cock a revolver,

282
00:20:00,281 --> 00:20:04,493
sneak up a fire escape, pump Helen
full of lead, then get away,

283
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:09,457
perhaps wearing revolutionary
war regalia to confuse witnesses.

284
00:20:11,542 --> 00:20:14,545
ln fact - and this is way out there - but...

285
00:20:16,172 --> 00:20:19,550
check if there were
any local bank robberies at the time,

286
00:20:19,717 --> 00:20:23,846
committed by a short, hairy man
wearing a powdered wig.

287
00:20:26,557 --> 00:20:29,310
You think the monkey was the killer?

288
00:20:30,144 --> 00:20:32,646
When l said l was next to him,

289
00:20:32,813 --> 00:20:36,066
l was really most of the way
across the room.

290
00:20:38,402 --> 00:20:41,905
- Well, wasn't he?
- No, it was Shelby.

291
00:20:43,032 --> 00:20:46,744
- Who's Shelby?
- A cop. He was in love with Helen.

292
00:20:48,037 --> 00:20:49,872
Oh.

293
00:20:50,873 --> 00:20:53,542
Well, that was my second choice.

294
00:20:57,838 --> 00:21:01,175
- Can l freshen anyone's drink?
- Help me out, Frasier.

295
00:21:01,341 --> 00:21:04,303
What was the monkey's motive?

296
00:21:05,596 --> 00:21:10,267
Jealousy? Or maybe he just did it
for the insurance money?

297
00:21:10,475 --> 00:21:15,063
Hey! Do you think we should
put a tail on that monkey?

298
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:19,192
Listen, if that monkey did it,
he'll swing for this.

299
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:24,948
- Yes, that's all very funny.
