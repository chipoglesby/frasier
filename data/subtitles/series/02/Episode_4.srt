1
00:00:10,451 --> 00:00:14,413
(Woman) 'You see, Dr Crane,
there's this man l'd like to go out with,

2
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,583
'but he's 40 and he's never
been married.

3
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,960
'Does that mean something? '

4
00:00:20,127 --> 00:00:22,588
lt could mean he has a fear
of commitment

5
00:00:22,754 --> 00:00:26,341
or it could mean he's just been lucky.

6
00:00:28,051 --> 00:00:30,262
Marie, that was a joke.

7
00:00:30,429 --> 00:00:34,016
(Marie ) 'Did l mention
l'm calling from a payphone? '

8
00:00:34,182 --> 00:00:36,476
All right, Marie, l would say,

9
00:00:36,643 --> 00:00:40,522
give him a shot,
but l'd keep that caution bulb lit.

10
00:00:40,689 --> 00:00:43,817
Thank you for your call. Who's next?

11
00:00:43,984 --> 00:00:48,739
lf someone's never been married,
it might mean they're a careful shopper.

12
00:00:48,905 --> 00:00:53,702
A divorcé will bite into any piece
of fruit without squeezing it first.

13
00:00:54,911 --> 00:00:59,166
That was an unbiased opinion
from my unmarried producer, Roz,

14
00:00:59,332 --> 00:01:04,212
who, incidentally,
has squeezed more fruit than Tropicana.

15
00:01:07,424 --> 00:01:09,384
May we take another call?

16
00:01:09,551 --> 00:01:11,636
lt's time for a station break.

17
00:01:11,803 --> 00:01:14,723
Then we'll be right back after this.

18
00:01:16,808 --> 00:01:21,771
- Didn't we just take a break?
- l'm parked at a meter. l'll be back.

19
00:01:21,938 --> 00:01:26,943
Do l have headphone hair? l may
have to flirt my way out of a ticket.

20
00:01:29,571 --> 00:01:33,950
- Are you all right?
- l got winded but l'm OK.

21
00:01:34,117 --> 00:01:37,954
- Ow! My ankle!
- Here, Roz, does this hurt?

22
00:01:39,664 --> 00:01:42,750
- No nerve damage.
- She should have an x-ray.

23
00:01:42,917 --> 00:01:45,795
- Frasier, the show!
- l'll get someone to fill in.

24
00:01:45,962 --> 00:01:48,631
No, now! You've got dead air!
Ow!

25
00:01:50,717 --> 00:01:53,511
- Take the shoe off.
- Oh!

26
00:01:53,678 --> 00:01:55,722
- Oh, dear!
- What is it?

27
00:01:55,888 --> 00:01:58,975
lt's been a while
since our last pedicure.

28
00:02:05,273 --> 00:02:06,691
(Door knocks)

29
00:02:06,858 --> 00:02:09,485
- Who is it?
- Frasier.

30
00:02:11,195 --> 00:02:14,115
How were things
at the emergency room?

31
00:02:14,282 --> 00:02:19,120
Frustrating. You know how it is.
You're sitting there in agony

32
00:02:19,287 --> 00:02:23,541
and every crybaby with a gunshot
waltzes in ahead of you.

33
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:28,421
- How was it after l left?
- Weird Bruce took over for you.

34
00:02:28,588 --> 00:02:33,426
That's quite a boot collection.
Why not put notches in your bedpost?

35
00:02:33,592 --> 00:02:38,139
Those are mine. You hate the way
l've decorated, don't you?

36
00:02:38,305 --> 00:02:42,393
No, no. As a matter of fact,
l admire your courage.

37
00:02:45,187 --> 00:02:47,231
- ls that for me?
- Yes.

38
00:02:47,398 --> 00:02:51,527
Freud said all we need to be happy
is work and love.

39
00:02:51,694 --> 00:02:53,988
Oh, thanks, Frasier!

40
00:02:54,947 --> 00:02:57,199
So you brought me work.

41
00:02:58,409 --> 00:03:01,537
Answering the fan mail
is something to do.

42
00:03:01,704 --> 00:03:06,000
Remember, this time,
death threats don't get photos.

43
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:07,585
(Door knocks)

44
00:03:07,751 --> 00:03:10,004
- Who is it?
- lt's Bulldog!

45
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:14,466
- Pretend we're not here.
- Roz, you just said, ''Who is it?''

46
00:03:18,095 --> 00:03:20,139
- Hey, Doc.
- Hey, Dog.

47
00:03:20,305 --> 00:03:23,726
Hey, Roz.
Wow! The whole place is a bedroom!

48
00:03:26,687 --> 00:03:32,401
- What are you doing here?
- l brought some deli.

49
00:03:32,651 --> 00:03:35,237
Nothing says ''l'm sorry''
like fatty meat.

50
00:03:37,364 --> 00:03:41,910
You got pastrami, coleslaw...
OK, where's the French fries?

51
00:03:42,786 --> 00:03:46,123
l ordered fries! This stinks!
This is total BS!

52
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:49,459
That apron boy is... Oh! Here they are.

53
00:03:51,795 --> 00:03:55,007
To think he does it all without steroids.

54
00:03:55,173 --> 00:03:57,926
- Shall l stick these in the oven?
- l'm not hungry.

55
00:03:58,093 --> 00:04:01,721
- Then you're not thirsty.
- Glasses are on the top shelf.

56
00:04:03,223 --> 00:04:06,601
- None for me. l'm off to the opera.
- You can't leave!

57
00:04:06,768 --> 00:04:11,606
- No ice cubes!
- Chip what you can off the freezer.

58
00:04:11,773 --> 00:04:15,610
- lf you leave, he'll hit on me.
- With a sprained ankle?

59
00:04:15,777 --> 00:04:20,365
lt's like in the jungle,
they go after the sick and the lame.

60
00:04:20,532 --> 00:04:24,286
l'm meeting people at the opera.
l've got the tickets.

61
00:04:24,452 --> 00:04:30,709
Here we go. l'll get you more ice when
the feeling in my forehead comes back.

62
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:35,922
Curtain going up. Roz, if you need
anything, call me absolutely any time.

63
00:04:36,089 --> 00:04:39,676
Except the next three hours.
l'm at the opera.

64
00:04:39,843 --> 00:04:41,886
No, four hours. lt's Wagner.

65
00:04:42,929 --> 00:04:46,641
Then l've got a late supper,
bed, an early squash game.

66
00:04:46,808 --> 00:04:51,020
Call me absolutely any time
after 4:00 tomorrow afternoon.

67
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:58,194
Hey, this is nice, you and me
having a drink together.

68
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:02,031
Yeah, it's been fun. Bye.

69
00:05:03,241 --> 00:05:07,704
- Why did you paint only two toenails?
- lt hurts when l reach.

70
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:11,416
- You want me to finish them?
- No, please. lt's OK.

71
00:05:11,582 --> 00:05:15,837
- Nice colour. Goes with the bruise.
- Bulldog, stop it!

72
00:05:16,003 --> 00:05:21,008
- You've got nice feet.
- You don't think they're too big?

73
00:05:21,175 --> 00:05:24,762
l could get this whole thing
in my mouth, easy.

74
00:05:31,227 --> 00:05:34,855
lt's really nice to do all this for me.

75
00:05:35,022 --> 00:05:37,608
Kind of surreal, but nice.

76
00:05:37,775 --> 00:05:41,362
l figure if l'm nice to you,
maybe you'll be nice to me.

77
00:05:41,529 --> 00:05:45,616
l knew it! You come over here
acting all sympathetic,

78
00:05:45,783 --> 00:05:49,745
but you're the same horny,
low-class slime ball as ever!

79
00:05:49,912 --> 00:05:53,791
Hey, before you say something
that offends me...

80
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:56,377
Look, all l wanted to ask you

81
00:05:56,544 --> 00:06:00,381
is if you'd be interested
in producing my show.

82
00:06:00,548 --> 00:06:03,425
- What?
- l'm not crazy about my producer.

83
00:06:03,592 --> 00:06:06,053
Let's face it, you're the best.

84
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:09,765
- You think so?
- That goes without saying.

85
00:06:09,932 --> 00:06:12,518
Frasier goes without saying it.

86
00:06:12,685 --> 00:06:16,730
Don't answer now.
Take your time and think about it.

87
00:06:16,897 --> 00:06:20,150
But l warn you - when l set my mind
on something, l get it.

88
00:06:21,151 --> 00:06:26,365
l once wanted to interview George
Foreman. He said ''no'', but l got him.

89
00:06:26,532 --> 00:06:30,202
l had to paint his toenails four times,
but l got him.

90
00:06:32,788 --> 00:06:38,001
Your bandage has been too tight.
Keep the blood flowing to the ligaments.

91
00:06:38,168 --> 00:06:43,006
That feels great. Whatever Frasier
is paying you, it's not enough.

92
00:06:43,173 --> 00:06:47,135
Actually, l'd need a raise
to get me to ''not enough''.

93
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:51,056
- Hey, Roz.
- Hey. What's going on?

94
00:06:51,223 --> 00:06:57,104
- Niles bought me some new shoes.
- Oh, yes, look: they have tassels.

95
00:06:58,939 --> 00:07:03,235
Aren't they exquisite?
They were individually handmade

96
00:07:03,402 --> 00:07:05,570
by an artisan near Florence.

97
00:07:06,738 --> 00:07:11,701
He is a hero there. lt's an event
when he completes a pair of shoes.

98
00:07:11,868 --> 00:07:15,705
They ring the cathedral bell
and the town celebrates.

99
00:07:16,873 --> 00:07:20,252
There's a town
that needs a bowling alley.

100
00:07:22,128 --> 00:07:24,506
- Evening, all.
- Hey, Frasier.

101
00:07:24,673 --> 00:07:28,218
Roz, did you hear the show?
l was in top form.

102
00:07:28,385 --> 00:07:31,846
l brilliantly cut a narcissist
down to size.

103
00:07:33,515 --> 00:07:36,184
Thank you, Niles.

104
00:07:36,351 --> 00:07:40,021
Oh, Dad, new shoes?
Do l hear cathedral bells?

105
00:07:43,066 --> 00:07:45,610
Ring-a-ding-ding.

106
00:07:46,653 --> 00:07:49,989
Roz, l apologise
for leaving you last night.

107
00:07:50,156 --> 00:07:52,992
l hope you didn't
have to fend off Bulldog.

108
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:56,788
He's not so bad.
Actually, we had a good time.

109
00:07:56,955 --> 00:08:01,960
- Oh?
- What, ''oh''?

110
00:08:02,126 --> 00:08:04,963
l noticed he came into work

111
00:08:05,129 --> 00:08:08,716
wearing the same clothes
he had on yesterday.

112
00:08:08,883 --> 00:08:11,177
Oh?

113
00:08:11,344 --> 00:08:15,264
- What's going on?
- Roz slept with Bulldog last night.

114
00:08:17,058 --> 00:08:20,144
l did not! How could you think that?

115
00:08:20,311 --> 00:08:25,024
Dropping by, bringing you gifts -
he was after something.

116
00:08:25,191 --> 00:08:31,030
That's not fair. Dr Crane brings me gifts
and he's not after anything.

117
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:45,836
l did not sleep with Bulldog.
He didn't even hit on me.

118
00:08:46,003 --> 00:08:50,758
But he wanted something. He wanted
me to leave you and be his producer.

119
00:08:50,925 --> 00:08:53,636
l wonder why he said that.

120
00:08:58,015 --> 00:09:02,311
- Because he really wants me.
- Yes, that goes without saying.

121
00:09:03,145 --> 00:09:08,275
- For his show.
- Bulldog knows he has to be subtle.

122
00:09:08,442 --> 00:09:11,320
But his ultimate goal remains to...

123
00:09:11,487 --> 00:09:14,823
- To what?
- To play Aeneas to your Dido.

124
00:09:20,788 --> 00:09:23,916
l'm sorry you had to hear that,
Daphne.

125
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:29,546
As usual, l haven't the foggiest
idea what you're talking about.

126
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:32,883
This is so insulting.

127
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:37,096
You think he wants me to work for him
just to get me into his bed.

128
00:09:37,262 --> 00:09:39,973
lt doesn't occur to you
he thinks l'm a good producer.

129
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:44,019
- Aren't you being naive?
- l'll tell you what naive is.

130
00:09:44,186 --> 00:09:46,480
lt's someone who thinks
he can talk to me like that

131
00:09:46,647 --> 00:09:48,690
without getting a crutch up his butt!

132
00:09:49,942 --> 00:09:53,612
- l'm an expert in human behaviour!
- Oh, really?

133
00:09:53,779 --> 00:09:57,032
Excuse me.
l've heard your expert advice!

134
00:09:57,199 --> 00:10:01,912
The only mental disorder
you've ever cured is insomnia!

135
00:10:03,872 --> 00:10:05,916
So you had time to listen,

136
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:11,296
what with your demanding tasks:
answering phones and pushing buttons.

137
00:10:11,463 --> 00:10:15,592
A cockatoo with a strong beak
could do what you do!

138
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:20,138
Then hire one.
l'm taking the job with Bulldog.

139
00:10:21,056 --> 00:10:23,225
That's it. l am out of here.

140
00:10:31,274 --> 00:10:34,569
Take a picture,
because l'm out of your life!

141
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:37,989
You have seen the last of me!

142
00:10:39,616 --> 00:10:41,868
Sayonara!

143
00:10:43,328 --> 00:10:45,830
Oh, damn! My purse.

144
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:54,881
Bruce, l see we are loaded
with callers. What line is next?

145
00:10:55,048 --> 00:10:59,594
- What's your favourite number?
- Three.

146
00:11:01,095 --> 00:11:03,473
(Dialling tone )

147
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,516
Damn.

148
00:11:06,476 --> 00:11:09,020
What's your other favourite number?

149
00:11:09,187 --> 00:11:11,439
Just let me handle this.

150
00:11:12,315 --> 00:11:15,943
Hello. You're on the line
with Frasier Crane. l'm listening.

151
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:18,905
'Hi, Dr Crane.
My name is Francesca.

152
00:11:19,072 --> 00:11:23,451
'l'm calling about my boyfriend.
He says he loves me,

153
00:11:23,618 --> 00:11:27,663
'but l'm afraid l'll get home one day
and he won't be there.

154
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:31,709
'lt probably stems from my childhood
when my father left us.'

155
00:11:31,876 --> 00:11:36,130
Francesca, you are suffering
from a fear of abandonment,

156
00:11:36,297 --> 00:11:38,341
but l'm here for you.

157
00:11:38,508 --> 00:11:40,927
(Francesca)
'Thank you. l'm always so afraid

158
00:11:41,093 --> 00:11:45,348
'the people l count on
will' just disappear and l'll...'

159
00:11:45,514 --> 00:11:48,434
(Phone line goes dead)

160
00:11:50,311 --> 00:11:52,146
Sorry.

161
00:11:55,316 --> 00:11:59,028
Francesca,
we had a little technical glitch.

162
00:11:59,195 --> 00:12:01,238
We're almost out of time.

163
00:12:01,405 --> 00:12:05,117
Call in tomorrow
and l'll make sure you're first.

164
00:12:05,284 --> 00:12:10,915
We're just about wrapped up here.
l'll see you tomorrow, Seattle.

165
00:12:18,797 --> 00:12:20,883
Good show, Dr Crane.

166
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:25,638
- You think so, Bruce?
- Yeah.

167
00:12:25,804 --> 00:12:29,933
When my show starts with a screech
that could shatter crystal,

168
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,144
then plays me eating chips,

169
00:12:32,311 --> 00:12:36,190
then disconnects a woman
who fears abandonment,

170
00:12:36,357 --> 00:12:39,443
it's not a show
to mail to the Smithsonian.

171
00:12:40,778 --> 00:12:44,490
Don't worry, man.
You'll do better tomorrow.

172
00:12:47,868 --> 00:12:52,831
- lt's going to be a great show, Roz.
- You've got a minute to show time.

173
00:12:52,998 --> 00:12:55,292
- Hello, Roz.
- Hello, Frasier.

174
00:12:55,459 --> 00:13:00,339
Hope you haven't been avoiding me
because l stole your chick.

175
00:13:00,505 --> 00:13:03,800
- We're getting along great.
- l heard Bruce.

176
00:13:03,967 --> 00:13:06,845
Did the cockatoo
want too much money?

177
00:13:09,348 --> 00:13:12,434
- Bye, Roz.
- So long, Frasier.

178
00:13:12,601 --> 00:13:17,147
A moment, Frasier, please.
l'm sure word has reached your ear

179
00:13:17,314 --> 00:13:19,441
<i>about my frutti di mare party</i>

180
00:13:19,608 --> 00:13:22,903
to celebrate our city's bounty
from the sea.

181
00:13:23,069 --> 00:13:27,240
- Yes. l'd love to come.
- There's the rub. l've invited Roz.

182
00:13:27,407 --> 00:13:32,746
With the rift between you, the tension
will be thicker than my cioppino.

183
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,707
That rift will soon be over.

184
00:13:35,874 --> 00:13:40,170
Bulldog will prove
he just wants to get his hands on Roz.

185
00:13:40,337 --> 00:13:43,715
That moment may have arrived.
She's bending over.

186
00:13:43,882 --> 00:13:45,967
Turn around, Bulldog!

187
00:13:46,134 --> 00:13:49,429
lsn't that what golfers refer to as
''teeing it up''?

188
00:13:50,638 --> 00:13:53,600
All right. He moves in.
And he...

189
00:13:53,767 --> 00:13:55,977
...helps pick up the papers!

190
00:13:56,144 --> 00:14:00,482
l'm so sorry, Frasier. l, too,
entertained hopes for low comedy.

191
00:14:02,192 --> 00:14:07,071
Attention, sports fans! You're back
in the doghouse with Bulldog Briscoe!

192
00:14:07,238 --> 00:14:09,449
- Woof woof!
- Meow!

193
00:14:09,616 --> 00:14:13,620
Football: Broncos over the Raiders!
Easy money, eh, Roz?

194
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:18,875
Yeah, right, and men just want
to cuddle. LA humiliated Denver!

195
00:14:19,042 --> 00:14:22,920
Do l tell you how to clean?
Denver's due. lt's a no-brainer.

196
00:14:23,087 --> 00:14:25,590
Then it's right up your alley.

197
00:14:29,886 --> 00:14:34,223
l'm no sports fan, but they really
are quite delicious together.

198
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:37,769
Enjoy it now.
Bulldog can't control his libido forever.

199
00:14:37,935 --> 00:14:41,439
- Then Roz will crawl back to you.
- Yes.

200
00:14:41,606 --> 00:14:46,402
Meanwhile, l need a half-competent
producer. How hard is that?

201
00:14:46,569 --> 00:14:49,155
# They call me Mr Pitiful

202
00:14:49,322 --> 00:14:52,116
# Baby, that's my name

203
00:14:52,283 --> 00:14:55,077
# They call me Mr Pitiful

204
00:14:55,244 --> 00:14:58,122
# That's how l got my fame

205
00:14:58,289 --> 00:15:01,125
# But nobody seems to understand now

206
00:15:01,292 --> 00:15:04,086
# What makes a man feel so blue

207
00:15:04,253 --> 00:15:07,006
# They call me Mr Pitiful

208
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:10,092
# Cause l lost someone just like you

209
00:15:10,259 --> 00:15:12,970
# They call me Mr Pitiful

210
00:15:13,137 --> 00:15:15,890
# This everybody knows now

211
00:15:16,056 --> 00:15:18,642
# They call me Mr Pitiful

212
00:15:18,809 --> 00:15:21,896
# Most everyplace l go now

213
00:15:22,062 --> 00:15:24,106
# But nobody seems
to understand now... #

214
00:15:27,902 --> 00:15:32,364
This morning, Maris and l
woke to the sound of our gardener

215
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:34,992
hacking through our topiary.

216
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:37,911
Why do you want hedges
shaped like animals?

217
00:15:38,078 --> 00:15:43,292
We're both animal lovers,
but Maris is unable to have pets. She...

218
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:50,382
She distrusts anything
that loves her unconditionally.

219
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:59,558
There was Yoshi, drunk as a lord,
recklessly swinging his hedge trimmer.

220
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:01,852
Before we could calm him,
he had transformed

221
00:16:02,019 --> 00:16:07,357
Maris' prized stallion
into an obscene goatboy.

222
00:16:12,321 --> 00:16:16,116
- The poor woman is inconsolable.
- Thank you, Niles.

223
00:16:16,283 --> 00:16:18,410
You've been a great help.

224
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:21,997
There are worse things
than a ruined career.

225
00:16:22,164 --> 00:16:26,001
l could have my hedges
cut into unattractive shapes.

226
00:16:27,544 --> 00:16:30,046
lt's always about you, isn't it?

227
00:16:30,213 --> 00:16:34,551
l'm just the slightest bit panicky
l'll never get Roz back.

228
00:16:34,718 --> 00:16:38,263
l've been waiting for weeks
for Bulldog to make his move

229
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:40,640
and he hasn't.

230
00:16:40,807 --> 00:16:45,604
- l thought we might run into you two.
- We've been buying shoes.

231
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:49,816
Not that l don't appreciate
the ones you bought me,

232
00:16:49,983 --> 00:16:55,030
but l'll save those for special
occasions when only tassels will do.

233
00:16:55,196 --> 00:16:59,826
Hey, get a load of these.
They light up when l walk away.

234
00:17:01,786 --> 00:17:04,164
Doesn't everyone?

235
00:17:06,124 --> 00:17:09,794
l see Mr Congeniality
is still spreading sunshine.

236
00:17:09,961 --> 00:17:15,884
- Things didn't go well in his show.
- Really? These things go in cycles.

237
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:21,556
Take Bulldog's show. He's just had
one great show after another lately.

238
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,102
What could be your point?
l can't read between the lines.

239
00:17:26,269 --> 00:17:31,858
lf you weren't so stubborn,
you'd apologise to Roz and get her back.

240
00:17:32,025 --> 00:17:34,736
You're ignoring
a key psychological component.

241
00:17:34,902 --> 00:17:38,114
- You'd have to admit you were wrong.
- Exactly!

242
00:17:40,241 --> 00:17:43,286
l don't see what's so hard
about that.

243
00:17:43,453 --> 00:17:48,583
lt's not the same as Dad or you being
wrong. l have a degree from Harvard.

244
00:17:48,749 --> 00:17:52,336
Whenever l'm wrong,
the world makes less sense.

245
00:17:58,467 --> 00:18:02,346
Why do you want her back?
She's pushy and opinionated.

246
00:18:02,513 --> 00:18:08,060
Aren't you being sexist? That would
be labelled ''assertiveness'' in a man.

247
00:18:08,227 --> 00:18:12,565
Gone are the days when women
were shunted aside to say nothing.

248
00:18:12,732 --> 00:18:16,235
- l quite agree.
- Daphne, please, l can handle this.

249
00:18:16,444 --> 00:18:19,071
You've handled it well so far.

250
00:18:19,238 --> 00:18:24,410
lt's time you got off your high horse
and begged her forgiveness.

251
00:18:24,577 --> 00:18:26,745
And get your knees dusty.

252
00:18:26,912 --> 00:18:30,749
l'm sorry, l'm not quite ready
to swallow my pride.

253
00:18:32,293 --> 00:18:35,671
Next time,
wake me when the show's over.

254
00:18:43,262 --> 00:18:47,850
End of Wednesday's show
we do the ''Boner of the Week''.

255
00:18:48,017 --> 00:18:50,436
- No.
- This is why l hate you.

256
00:18:50,602 --> 00:18:54,314
You want to change
my tried and true format! Why not?

257
00:18:54,481 --> 00:18:57,401
l got you an interview
with Wayne Gretzky.

258
00:18:57,568 --> 00:18:59,820
See... Wayne Gretzky?

259
00:19:00,946 --> 00:19:04,366
This is awesome! This is total brilliance!

260
00:19:04,533 --> 00:19:07,035
This is...a pinched nerve.

261
00:19:09,079 --> 00:19:14,251
Football injury. l got my head rammed
into a locker during an interview.

262
00:19:14,418 --> 00:19:19,715
- Let me help you with that.
- This is great. l can't believe it.

263
00:19:19,881 --> 00:19:22,551
Wayne Gretzky! The great one!

264
00:19:23,885 --> 00:19:28,890
Roz, you are the great one.
You are some kind of producer.

265
00:19:29,057 --> 00:19:32,394
Thanks. l'm having a great time.

266
00:19:32,561 --> 00:19:35,730
l owe you, Bulldog. l owe you big.

267
00:19:43,697 --> 00:19:48,034
lt's amazing, but you and l
have great chemistry together.

268
00:19:48,201 --> 00:19:52,497
Uh-huh. l like chemistry.
l flunked it, but l like it.

269
00:19:53,581 --> 00:19:57,168
You got any of that Wild Turkey left?

270
00:19:57,335 --> 00:19:59,379
Yeah. Sure.

271
00:20:00,672 --> 00:20:03,383
When we started working together,

272
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:07,470
l never thought it would turn out
like this. Did you?

273
00:20:07,637 --> 00:20:09,681
All along!

274
00:20:14,727 --> 00:20:16,771
Hey, Roz!

275
00:20:18,147 --> 00:20:21,401
You'd better make mine a double!

276
00:20:21,568 --> 00:20:23,945
l'm a double kind of guy!

277
00:20:24,112 --> 00:20:28,491
No, there's a lot l want to do tonight
and l want you to keep up.

278
00:20:29,534 --> 00:20:31,786
Yeah, well, uh...

279
00:20:31,953 --> 00:20:36,082
All l ask is you give me
a couple of 20-minute breaks.

280
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,003
What's that?

281
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:44,507
l thought a little music might be nice.

282
00:20:45,258 --> 00:20:48,928
- Can you concentrate with that on?
- Oh, yeah.

283
00:20:49,095 --> 00:20:53,683
Actually,
l find the distraction helps me.

284
00:20:57,395 --> 00:20:59,564
Nah. Second date. Don't be pushy.

285
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:04,610
This is great, Roz! Us working like this!

286
00:21:06,237 --> 00:21:09,031
Did you and the doc
ever end up working...

287
00:21:10,741 --> 00:21:13,995
- What?
- You and the doc ever work like this?

288
00:21:14,161 --> 00:21:17,331
We tried, but he complained
l talked too much.

289
00:21:17,498 --> 00:21:21,752
Oh, yeah? l would have figured you
for a screamer.

290
00:21:24,713 --> 00:21:28,217
What the hell are you doing in my bed?
Get out!

291
00:21:28,384 --> 00:21:32,805
l asked you over here to work,
you disgusting pervert!

292
00:21:32,972 --> 00:21:36,892
Slow down!
l'm getting some mixed signals here.

293
00:21:40,854 --> 00:21:43,983
- What are you doing?
- ls this clear enough?

294
00:21:44,149 --> 00:21:48,487
- Are you crazy? My wallet's in there!
- Get out, now!

295
00:21:48,654 --> 00:21:50,698
Get out of my way, Doc!

296
00:21:51,782 --> 00:21:53,701
Oh.

297
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,163
l'm listening.

298
00:22:04,586 --> 00:22:09,842
# Baby, l hear the blues are calling
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

299
00:22:10,008 --> 00:22:11,885
