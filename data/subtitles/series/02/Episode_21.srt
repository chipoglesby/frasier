1
00:00:10,928 --> 00:00:13,347
Thank you for your call, Lorraine.

2
00:00:13,514 --> 00:00:17,809
And before the commercial break,
Roz has an important message. Roz?

3
00:00:21,605 --> 00:00:23,941
What? Can't come to the mic?

4
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:28,570
Well, what she wanted to say was...

5
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:33,367
Tomorrow, on Amber Edwards'
''Bookchat'',

6
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:37,788
sociologist Lamont Myman
discusses his book,

7
00:00:37,955 --> 00:00:42,543
''Violence in the Workplace -
Why Co-Workers Kill''.

8
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:47,714
Something which becomes
more and more relevant.

9
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,925
We'll be right back.

10
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:53,804
Open up, you piece of tin!

11
00:00:54,638 --> 00:00:57,057
- Roz!
- What are you doing here?

12
00:00:57,224 --> 00:01:02,437
And you? Shouldn't you wait
till after the show before exiting?

13
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:07,234
- l have a little urge. Damn it!
- What is the matter?

14
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:10,571
l have got to have chocolate!

15
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:15,993
lt's kind of a celebration.

16
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,955
At 1 1 :07 am, l finished
one of those magazine diets.

17
00:01:20,122 --> 00:01:23,208
''Seven days
to a healthier, calmer you.''

18
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:28,547
Come on, Roz!
l'm doing this for your own good.

19
00:01:28,714 --> 00:01:31,133
Wait!
Something came out!

20
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:35,846
Damn! Chocolate-covered raisins.

21
00:01:36,013 --> 00:01:39,683
l'd like to meet the idiot
who came up with these.

22
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:43,604
Take a grape, let it shrivel
into a disgusting little wart

23
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,024
and cover it
with perfectly good chocolate.

24
00:01:47,191 --> 00:01:50,861
What the hell!
l'll suck the chocolate off.

25
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:56,033
Be sure to save what's left
to make some wine!

26
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:08,545
l see those years of finishing school
paid off.

27
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:13,842
<i>Mon frère, we're in luck.</i>

28
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:16,428
(High-pitched electronic beep)

29
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:26,647
Meadow Wood Properties still has
one share left in the mini-mall.

30
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:32,069
- We should buy it. Give me five, Bro.
- l told you l'm not interested.

31
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:36,782
lt's a 1 2%%% return.
We've a chance to make a real killing.

32
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:42,120
You and Maris are wallowing in money
like a couple of yuppie hogs.

33
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:46,708
This has nothing to do with Maris.
This is my money.

34
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:49,586
- And mine.
- And yours.

35
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:55,259
Show some understanding. Maris
uses her money to emasculate him.

36
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:59,930
This is his attempt to stop feeling
like a financial eunuch

37
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:04,935
and regain some shred of his
former manhood - such as it was.

38
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,355
Well?

39
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,943
- 1 2%%%?
- Net.

40
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:17,865
lf you're unhappy, at the end
of the year l'll buy you out.

41
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:21,952
- OK, l'm in.
- Thank you, Frasier.

42
00:03:23,412 --> 00:03:27,249
Thank you, Roz.
That ''financial eunuch'' bit was great.

43
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:30,377
Well, look what l had to work with.

44
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:43,098
Hey, check this out! 25 cents off on
a pack of Butterbuds imitation butter.

45
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:47,060
My! l can taste that scampi now!

46
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,024
Well?

47
00:03:52,191 --> 00:03:54,234
(Martin wolf whistles)

48
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:58,197
Daphne, very nice!

49
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,658
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

50
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:06,830
l'd be more flattered if l didn't know
how hard up you both are.

51
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:15,631
l'm going out with Derek,
but l can't choose a fragrance.

52
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:18,800
l've got it pinned down to these two.

53
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:22,846
Heather: ''fresh and bouncy
as a spring morning''.

54
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:27,935
Or Forbidden: ''your passport
to erotic realms of pleasure''.

55
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:32,523
- How many times have you been out?
- lt's our third date.

56
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:34,691
Forbidden.

57
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:38,529
So what if it's our third date?

58
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:42,366
Well, sexual mores
being what they are in America,

59
00:04:42,533 --> 00:04:46,203
the third date is usually
when two healthy adults

60
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:49,122
decide whether or not to...

61
00:04:51,834 --> 00:04:57,214
- ...take it to the next level.
- What kind of randy custom is that?

62
00:04:57,381 --> 00:04:58,799
(Doorbell)

63
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:01,635
First date, second date,
let's pitch our knickers!

64
00:05:02,678 --> 00:05:05,180
lt may be the third date for you,

65
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:10,227
but it takes more than three dinners
to get bangers and mash with me.

66
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:18,151
- Hello, Dr Crane.
- Hello, Daphne.

67
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:22,531
- You look even lovelier than usual.
- Thank you.

68
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:28,120
ls that... Forbidden?

69
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:30,998
ln every sense of the word.

70
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:36,378
l'll scrub my neck
with unscented soap.

71
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:40,424
You Americans have
an unhealthy obsession with sex.

72
00:05:40,591 --> 00:05:45,554
l'm sorry we can't all be as chaste
and restrained as the Royal family!

73
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:50,767
- Good one, Dad!
- l've been saving it!

74
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:57,816
Frasier, good news.
l spoke to my broker.

75
00:05:57,983 --> 00:06:02,362
Meadow Wood Properties have leased
85%%% of the mini-mall.

76
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:06,283
lnstead of 1 2%%%,
they're projecting a 1 5%%% return.

77
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:10,537
Fantastic! Let's go celebrate
at an exclusive boîte.

78
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:13,457
Yes, but the question is,
what boîte?

79
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:16,668
- Charise?
- Too noisy.

80
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:18,170
- Alsace?
- Too bright.

81
00:06:18,337 --> 00:06:20,172
- Papillon?
- Too crowded.

82
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:22,549
We've run out of boîtes.

83
00:06:23,926 --> 00:06:27,012
A city this size
and only three boîtes.

84
00:06:27,179 --> 00:06:29,973
How do we live?

85
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:35,145
- l'm going to Duke's. How about you?
- Looking for a place to eat.

86
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:37,564
Come and have a beer with me.

87
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:42,361
- At Duke's?
- Yeah.

88
00:06:43,237 --> 00:06:45,614
- Us?
- Yeah.

89
00:06:45,781 --> 00:06:49,117
- With you?
- Am l speaking Swahili? Yeah!

90
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:54,039
You two, at Duke's, with me,
a beer, if you want! Gee!

91
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:05,300
Good God, do you believe that?

92
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:09,638
No. No one in the family
has ever been invited to Duke's.

93
00:07:09,805 --> 00:07:14,685
Not even Mother. Though at times
she could be quite the old rummy.

94
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:21,984
Why, after 30 years,
is he suddenly inviting us there?

95
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,444
- Cheerio!
- Daphne!

96
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:27,990
Has Dad said anything to you
about us and Duke's?

97
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:32,411
- Has he been planning this?
- You mean, behind your backs?

98
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:37,541
- Precisely.
- No! What a couple of wallies!

99
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:42,921
l have never met a family that's
so uncomfortable with each other.

100
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:47,509
Could it be he just wants
a pint with his sons?

101
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,554
No. Duke's is where Dad goes

102
00:07:50,721 --> 00:07:54,474
to escape the stresses
and strains of everyday life.

103
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:57,311
ln other words, us.

104
00:07:58,896 --> 00:08:02,858
Well, you could sit here
analysing why he invited you

105
00:08:03,025 --> 00:08:06,778
and fritter the night away,
or - here's a thought -

106
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:10,699
you could just go
and find out for yourselves.

107
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:15,287
For a lay person, she has a way
of cutting through the crap.

108
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:37,643
Oh, my God! lt's a roomful of Dads!

109
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:43,482
- There he is!
- Oh, look at him holding court.

110
00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:48,320
No wonder he likes it here.
They're hanging on his every word.

111
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:53,951
l've never seen him have such fun
without a remote control.

112
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:57,079
Frasier, Niles!
l'm glad you could make it.

113
00:08:57,246 --> 00:09:00,165
Meet some guys
l was on the force with.

114
00:09:00,332 --> 00:09:03,919
Meet my boys. This is Frasier.
He's on the radio.

115
00:09:04,086 --> 00:09:07,881
This is Marty's kid,
the guy on the radio!

116
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:14,721
Hey, Frasier, Joe Herman,
nice to meet you. Check this out:

117
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:17,432
''l'm listening.''

118
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:21,854
lt's like a recording of myself.

119
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:25,315
- Dad.
- What?

120
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:27,985
Oh, this is my other son, Niles.

121
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:30,404
He's a psychiatrist, too.

122
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:37,035
- He married money!
- All right!

123
00:09:39,955 --> 00:09:42,708
Duke, l want you to meet my boys.

124
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:46,378
This is Frasier
and this is Niles.

125
00:09:46,545 --> 00:09:51,258
How are you? How about a couple
of Duke's specials for you?

126
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:53,927
- What would those be?
- Boilermakers.

127
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:56,263
Shot of whisky. Beer back.

128
00:09:56,513 --> 00:10:01,602
We've been drinking those all night.
Time to switch to sherry.

129
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:06,231
Two boilermakers, please.

130
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:10,527
Marty's been telling us about you
since you were kids.

131
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:13,155
- Dad!
- l'll tell you, Frasier,

132
00:10:13,405 --> 00:10:17,701
we felt terrible when we heard
your wife was screwing around.

133
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:20,871
- What was her name again?
- Lilith!

134
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,920
Hey, it was a slow night, all right?

135
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:32,424
All right, everybody, settle down.
l want to make a toast.

136
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:38,805
For 30 years, Duke's has been
my home away from home.

137
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:42,059
l look around
and l see a lot of friends.

138
00:10:42,226 --> 00:10:46,438
l'm going to miss you.
l'm going to miss this joint, too.

139
00:10:46,605 --> 00:10:49,858
May there be a place in hell
for those SOBs

140
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:53,862
who are tearing it down
to build a mini-mall!

141
00:10:55,739 --> 00:11:00,911
Those snivelling, rat-faced bastards
from Meadow Wood Properties!

142
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:02,538
To Duke's!

143
00:11:02,788 --> 00:11:04,665
Two more!

144
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:12,714
- Did you talk to your lawyer.
- Yes. He's examined the contract.

145
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:16,969
The general partner won't consider
moving the site.

146
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:19,388
The deal's going through.

147
00:11:19,555 --> 00:11:23,100
We could have Duke's
declared a historical landmark.

148
00:11:23,267 --> 00:11:28,272
No. They tore down Seattle's first
Pony Express office to build it.

149
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:30,482
- Damn!
- Here you go, guys.

150
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:35,404
One cappuccino, one latte
and these are on me.

151
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:41,618
- This guilt is driving me crazy.
- lt should. You earn more than me.

152
00:11:44,413 --> 00:11:49,001
- Duke's was his life.
- There's nothing we can do about it.

153
00:11:49,168 --> 00:11:52,671
Look at it this way:
we're doing Dad a service,

154
00:11:52,838 --> 00:11:56,675
stopping him from drinking.
And the other policemen as well.

155
00:11:56,842 --> 00:11:59,511
Maybe it's a community service.

156
00:11:59,678 --> 00:12:03,599
Men with guns will have
one less place to liquor up.

157
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:06,602
There's always Roz's place.

158
00:12:10,147 --> 00:12:13,192
What do you say about me
when l'm not around?

159
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:16,862
l won't feel better till l tell Dad.

160
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:19,364
Oh, no.

161
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:24,453
lt's like a woman who has one crazy
night and cheats on her boyfriend.

162
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:28,707
Her only reason to confess
is to make herself feel better.

163
00:12:28,874 --> 00:12:32,836
So the best thing she can do
is to keep her mouth shut.

164
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:36,423
Unless her boyfriend walks in,

165
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:41,595
because he's flown home instead
of driving like he said he would,

166
00:12:41,762 --> 00:12:46,099
in which case, he's the liar,
so why should she feel bad?

167
00:12:46,308 --> 00:12:49,853
Thank you, Roz, for that
purely theoretical example.

168
00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:58,111
l agree. lf we tell him now, it'll
hurt him. We've got to keep it quiet.

169
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:02,533
- l don't think it can be done.
- Of course it can!

170
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:04,993
You can look Dad in the eye,

171
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:08,455
knowing you have destroyed
his sanctuary?

172
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:10,666
You can live with that?

173
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:15,254
You forget. l married Lilith.
l can live with anything.

174
00:13:37,109 --> 00:13:39,152
(Electronic buzz)

175
00:13:50,539 --> 00:13:55,085
You buy into an investment group,
Eddie. You don't know.

176
00:13:59,798 --> 00:14:04,303
- Dad, what are you doing up?
- l reached out and Eddie wasn't there.

177
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:07,139
You need a woman, Dad.

178
00:14:08,015 --> 00:14:10,392
Tell me about it.

179
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:13,020
Oh, you turned the sign on.

180
00:14:13,187 --> 00:14:16,106
That was nice of Duke
to give it to me.

181
00:14:16,273 --> 00:14:20,485
You hold a glass of beer
in front of it, it turns green.

182
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:38,212
Dad...

183
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:44,760
Niles and l invested in the company
that's tearing down Duke's.

184
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:49,306
We tried to get out of it,
but we couldn't.

185
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:52,935
Yell at me, Dad, will you?

186
00:14:53,101 --> 00:14:55,145
Hit me with your cane.

187
00:14:55,312 --> 00:14:57,523
Just don't stand there.

188
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:08,492
Let me see if l've got this right.

189
00:15:08,659 --> 00:15:12,871
ln the last year, you give
my chair away, you lose my dog

190
00:15:13,038 --> 00:15:15,290
and now you demolish my bar.

191
00:15:15,457 --> 00:15:19,294
Next l'll find out you're the one
who shot me in the hip!

192
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:24,716
- l have an alibi for that one.
- You have one for everything.

193
00:15:24,883 --> 00:15:28,804
lt wasn't on purpose.
l'm part of an investment group.

194
00:15:28,971 --> 00:15:34,601
You watched me and my friends
get all weepy and didn't say anything.

195
00:15:35,477 --> 00:15:39,523
What did you want us to say?
''Fellas, here's something ironic...''

196
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:42,734
Why didn't you at least tell me?

197
00:15:44,069 --> 00:15:46,363
l don't know, l...

198
00:15:47,114 --> 00:15:48,824
l guess...

199
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:53,120
Maybe it was because,
when you invited me to Duke's,

200
00:15:53,287 --> 00:15:58,250
it felt like we were getting closer.
lt was a momentous step.

201
00:15:58,417 --> 00:16:00,878
- lt was a beer!
- Not to me.

202
00:16:01,044 --> 00:16:03,714
lt was validation.

203
00:16:03,881 --> 00:16:08,093
Finally, l was one of the guys
you wanted to hang out with.

204
00:16:10,179 --> 00:16:12,723
l didn't want to spoil that.

205
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:14,933
l'd have asked you before

206
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:20,439
but l just figured it was the kinda place
you'd look down your nose at.

207
00:16:20,606 --> 00:16:23,066
Well, you're probably right.

208
00:16:24,568 --> 00:16:26,695
Anyway, l'm sorry.

209
00:16:31,909 --> 00:16:36,121
- Maybe l spent too much time there.
- What do you mean?

210
00:16:36,288 --> 00:16:40,792
When you were growing up.
lf l'd spent less time at Duke's

211
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:44,213
and more with you,
l wouldn't have a son

212
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:47,007
who puts so much stock in one beer.

213
00:16:48,258 --> 00:16:52,304
You know, l was having
a pretty good time at Duke's.

214
00:16:52,471 --> 00:16:57,726
Till l found l was responsible for
wiping it off the face of the planet.

215
00:16:57,893 --> 00:17:00,979
l liked having you there, too, son.

216
00:17:02,105 --> 00:17:04,149
Thanks, Dad.

217
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:11,031
Do you mind? lt's driving me crazy.
lt looks like hell.

218
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:22,251
Know what? We got a few hours
before the wrecking ball comes.

219
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:25,879
- How about you and l go down there?
- To Duke's?

220
00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:27,965
- Yeah.
- Now?

221
00:17:28,131 --> 00:17:30,008
- Yeah.
- You and me?

222
00:17:30,175 --> 00:17:34,054
- Not this again!
- Yeah. All right, great.

223
00:17:34,221 --> 00:17:37,099
Just you, me and Charlie Ballantine.

224
00:17:38,183 --> 00:17:41,228
Meet you right back here in a minute.

225
00:17:42,271 --> 00:17:45,983
Oh, good evening, Daphne.
Or should l say good morning?

226
00:17:47,401 --> 00:17:51,947
- How was your date with Derek?
- We had a wonderful time.

227
00:17:52,614 --> 00:17:55,409
We went to dinner,
then to the symphony,

228
00:17:55,659 --> 00:18:00,622
then we took a lovely moonlight stroll
through the park.

229
00:18:00,789 --> 00:18:02,875
He's the perfect gentleman.

230
00:18:17,055 --> 00:18:21,226
Apparently in England,
it's the fourth date.

231
00:18:24,396 --> 00:18:25,397
(# ''Danny Boy'')

232
00:18:25,564 --> 00:18:29,401
# l'll be here

233
00:18:29,568 --> 00:18:36,241
# ln sunshine or in shadow

234
00:18:36,408 --> 00:18:42,581
# Oh, Danny Boy, oh, Danny Boy

235
00:18:42,748 --> 00:18:48,921
# l love you so #

236
00:18:52,424 --> 00:18:56,261
That's good.
lt reminds me of old Micky Dougan.

237
00:18:57,137 --> 00:18:59,932
One 4th July,
we were on mounted patrol

238
00:19:00,098 --> 00:19:03,477
in a big parade down Broad Street.

239
00:19:03,644 --> 00:19:06,647
lt was a scorcher.
Must have been 1 00%F.

240
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:10,651
l'm sitting on a thousand pounds
of hot, sweaty horse.

241
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:14,905
l must have been complaining
because, as we ride by Duke's,

242
00:19:15,072 --> 00:19:18,408
Micky says, ''lf you want a beer
so bad, get one!''

243
00:19:18,575 --> 00:19:23,497
So l ride through the front door,
up to the bar and order a beer.

244
00:19:24,248 --> 00:19:28,418
Duke plays it cool and says,
''What'll your friend have?''

245
00:19:28,585 --> 00:19:30,712
l say, ''Nothing, he's driving.''

246
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:37,386
- l've told you that one before, haven't l?
- Yeah.

247
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:41,223
Oh, what a place!

248
00:19:41,974 --> 00:19:45,143
- Another beer, Dad?
- Sure, why not?

249
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,273
Sun's up.

250
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:57,531
l look around this place
in the golden early morning light...

251
00:19:57,698 --> 00:20:02,286
lt's still a dump.
l'm going to miss it, though.

252
00:20:03,579 --> 00:20:06,915
l know what it is
to have a neighbourhood bar.

253
00:20:07,082 --> 00:20:12,171
l remember the last time l walked
out of my old watering hole in Boston.

254
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:16,633
lt was a strangely emotional day.

255
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:20,304
lt's the people, l guess.

256
00:20:21,597 --> 00:20:24,433
Saying goodbye to a lot of people.

257
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,768
Saying goodbye to this place

258
00:20:26,935 --> 00:20:30,772
doesn't mean you can't see
your buddies as much as ever.

259
00:20:32,357 --> 00:20:34,401
Yeah, it does.

260
00:20:36,028 --> 00:20:38,155
Yeah, you're right.

261
00:20:45,037 --> 00:20:49,833
But that's life. You move on.
Only a fool tries to fight it.

262
00:20:54,671 --> 00:20:58,091
- What are you doing?
- Stopping the demolition. And you?

263
00:20:58,258 --> 00:21:01,553
- Saying goodbye.
- You may not have to.

264
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:06,683
l intend to stand here
and face down the bulldozers.

265
00:21:06,934 --> 00:21:10,229
No need. l've talked to Dad.
He forgives us.

266
00:21:10,395 --> 00:21:15,359
- Sure, Son. Don't worry. lt's OK.
- ls it really? l think not!

267
00:21:16,693 --> 00:21:19,947
Today it's Duke's,
but tomorrow it's Mo's

268
00:21:20,113 --> 00:21:23,033
and the day after,
it's Ernie's Taproom.

269
00:21:23,283 --> 00:21:26,036
l'm not just here for you, Dad.

270
00:21:26,286 --> 00:21:31,416
l'm doing this for every little guy
who's found solace after a hard day

271
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:34,127
by bellying up at his local bar.

272
00:21:34,378 --> 00:21:37,256
l'll show faceless, corporate America

273
00:21:37,422 --> 00:21:40,676
they can't just
shove the little guy aside.

274
00:21:40,843 --> 00:21:44,346
Even when l'm
that faceless, corporate America.

275
00:21:44,513 --> 00:21:49,226
l'm here to fight the good fight,
to show those rat-faced heathens

276
00:21:49,476 --> 00:21:53,355
there's still some fury
in the heart of John Q Public.

277
00:22:05,409 --> 00:22:09,997
On the other hand, who am l
to stand in the way of progress?

278
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:18,964
# Hey baby, l hear the blues are calling
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

279
00:22:19,131 --> 00:22:20,507
# Quite stylish!

280
00:22:20,674 --> 00:22:27,431
# And maybe l seem a bit confused
Well, maybe, but l got you pegged

281
00:22:27,598 --> 00:22:33,270
# But l don't know what to do with those
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

282
00:22:33,437 --> 00:22:36,023
# They're calling again #

283
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:39,151
Good night everybody!
