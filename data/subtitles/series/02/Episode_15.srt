1
00:00:10,301 --> 00:00:12,345
- Hello, Frasier.
- Niles.

2
00:00:12,511 --> 00:00:15,222
Double latte, full fat,
chocolate shavings.

3
00:00:18,309 --> 00:00:22,104
- The self-pity special.
- l've had a hellish week.

4
00:00:22,271 --> 00:00:25,983
To top it off, our wine club president
kicked the bucket.

5
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:30,905
His body wasn't even chilled before
the club jackals angled to succeed him.

6
00:00:31,071 --> 00:00:33,324
You've never seen such conniving.

7
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:36,827
- Who's winning?
- Maris, of course, but just barely.

8
00:00:36,994 --> 00:00:39,496
Matthew Pym tried to stage a coup.

9
00:00:41,165 --> 00:00:44,960
Fortunately, Maris has photos
she took at his wedding,

10
00:00:45,127 --> 00:00:47,588
showing the label on the champagne.

11
00:00:47,755 --> 00:00:52,134
- Domestic?
- Not just domestic. From Connecticut.

12
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:57,306
lt's that dreadful woman
who works for you.

13
00:00:57,473 --> 00:01:01,477
- Who?
- Lady Macbeth without the sincerity.

14
00:01:01,643 --> 00:01:02,811
Oh, Bebe's here.

15
00:01:03,729 --> 00:01:08,442
l care for her just as little as you do,
but she is a terrific agent,

16
00:01:08,609 --> 00:01:13,322
which is why l overlook the fact that
she's pushy, obnoxious and a phoney.

17
00:01:13,489 --> 00:01:18,202
- Bebe, darling, how are you?
- My poor, wounded baby.

18
00:01:18,368 --> 00:01:21,830
l heard what those misers
you work for are trying to do.

19
00:01:21,997 --> 00:01:25,792
- They're not going to get away with it.
- You heard wrong.

20
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:28,629
They extended my contract
with an 8% raise.

21
00:01:28,795 --> 00:01:33,508
8% would insult even a waiter.
Double cappuccino. Move it!

22
00:01:33,675 --> 00:01:36,887
Well, Bebe,
that is what my contract calls for.

23
00:01:37,054 --> 00:01:40,557
A slave contract you negotiated
before you had an agent.

24
00:01:40,724 --> 00:01:44,770
- They took advantage of you.
- l thought it was generous.

25
00:01:44,936 --> 00:01:47,272
Do you have any idea how hot you are?

26
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:51,318
l get offers every day
offering the moon for you.

27
00:01:51,484 --> 00:01:54,738
- Am l really that hot?
- Are you kidding?

28
00:01:54,905 --> 00:01:57,866
lf l were a pot roast, l'd be done.

29
00:01:59,826 --> 00:02:02,787
l'm Niles, a person at the table.

30
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:09,919
Niles, thank God you're here.
Give him some brotherly advice.

31
00:02:10,086 --> 00:02:12,881
She's the devil. Run fast, run far.

32
00:02:15,508 --> 00:02:16,926
Bebe,

33
00:02:17,093 --> 00:02:22,515
l realise the station makes a handsome
profit on my show, but what can l do?

34
00:02:22,682 --> 00:02:27,478
- l do have a contract.
- No, darling, what you have is...a fever.

35
00:02:27,645 --> 00:02:31,900
- What?
- Ooh! You're like a furnace!

36
00:02:32,066 --> 00:02:36,863
l think l see where you're going with this
and l'm not sure how l feel about it.

37
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:40,617
- How do you feel about being low paid?
- Who makes more?

38
00:02:40,783 --> 00:02:44,454
Who doesn't? Nanette
from ''Pet Chat'', the Happy Chef.

39
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:47,832
- Father Mike could buy and sell you.
- Father Mike!

40
00:02:47,999 --> 00:02:51,711
- He took a vow of poverty.
- Well, now he's taking a cruise.

41
00:02:52,795 --> 00:02:57,842
Oh, that big, strapping chest
of yours is all congested.

42
00:02:58,009 --> 00:03:01,929
Say the word and l'll tell the station
you have some coughing up to do

43
00:03:02,096 --> 00:03:04,140
and so do they.

44
00:03:04,307 --> 00:03:07,185
Bebe, this fever of mine,

45
00:03:07,351 --> 00:03:10,021
how much higher
do you think it might go?

46
00:03:10,187 --> 00:03:13,274
l'm guessing 30% to 40%
above where it is now.

47
00:03:13,441 --> 00:03:15,151
40%?

48
00:03:15,318 --> 00:03:18,029
Well, what else can l say, but...

49
00:03:19,113 --> 00:03:20,948
...ah-choo.

50
00:03:26,037 --> 00:03:28,622
(TV man)
'You wanted me to get you pregnant.'

51
00:03:28,789 --> 00:03:30,416
(TV woman) 'l was in a coma.'

52
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:34,628
My God, in one scene
they've got Sky, Zena and Slate.

53
00:03:35,713 --> 00:03:39,925
l don't think someone called Frasier
should point any fingers.

54
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:44,221
ls this how you spend your days
when l'm not at home?

55
00:03:44,388 --> 00:03:47,641
When you're not home,
l can hear what they're saying.

56
00:03:47,808 --> 00:03:49,894
You wouldn't want to miss this.

57
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:55,816
''Oh, Zirconia, can't you see Stone
doesn't love you? He loves Placenta.''

58
00:03:58,902 --> 00:04:00,946
My favourite are the villains.

59
00:04:01,113 --> 00:04:04,199
One guy kicked
his grandmother down the stairs,

60
00:04:04,366 --> 00:04:07,619
embezzled money from a hospital
and poisoned a puppy.

61
00:04:07,786 --> 00:04:11,665
Give him credit, though.
He did show up for work every day.

62
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,296
lf you're going to be so subtle,
how will l ever get your point?

63
00:04:17,462 --> 00:04:20,424
l think when you sign a contract,
you stick to it.

64
00:04:20,591 --> 00:04:22,634
A man's only as good as his word.

65
00:04:22,801 --> 00:04:27,306
My words have doubled ad revenues
and they gave me a measly 8% raise.

66
00:04:27,472 --> 00:04:31,602
So what? ln 30 years on the police
force, do you think l ever said,

67
00:04:31,768 --> 00:04:35,230
''Hey, l'm shooting more bad guys,
how about a bonus?''

68
00:04:35,397 --> 00:04:37,441
(Doorbell rings)

69
00:04:37,607 --> 00:04:39,860
You don't understand.
lt's show business.

70
00:04:40,027 --> 00:04:42,070
- l'll get it.
- Thank you, Daphne.

71
00:04:42,237 --> 00:04:46,491
Negotiations are like a dance.
They expect me to fight my contract.

72
00:04:46,658 --> 00:04:50,287
They know l'm not sick. l know they
know. They know l know they know.

73
00:04:50,454 --> 00:04:54,666
- lt's all part of the negotiations mambo.
- Hello, Roz.

74
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:58,170
- Daphne. Hey, Martin.
- How are things at the front?

75
00:04:58,336 --> 00:05:00,922
They painted over
your parking space name.

76
00:05:01,089 --> 00:05:04,050
Perfect. Bebe told me they might.

77
00:05:04,217 --> 00:05:07,429
lt's a negotiating tactic.
lt shows they're nervous.

78
00:05:07,596 --> 00:05:10,765
They must be jittery.
They took your picture down.

79
00:05:10,932 --> 00:05:15,645
- Roz, they're just trying to scare me.
- He knows they're trying to scare him.

80
00:05:15,812 --> 00:05:19,399
They know that he knows
they're trying to scare him.

81
00:05:19,566 --> 00:05:21,609
Thank you, Dad!

82
00:05:22,694 --> 00:05:26,114
- lt's like a card game.
- Like a card game.

83
00:05:26,281 --> 00:05:30,076
lt's like a dance.
lt sounds like a weekend in Vegas.

84
00:05:31,578 --> 00:05:36,624
l thought they'd play games, too,
but they're auditioning replacements.

85
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:38,835
- They're interviewing people?
- All day.

86
00:05:39,002 --> 00:05:42,171
They're hot on this woman
who has a gardening show.

87
00:05:42,338 --> 00:05:44,382
She calls herself Ma Nature.

88
00:05:45,842 --> 00:05:49,554
l can't work for her, Frasier.
You should see her nails.

89
00:05:49,721 --> 00:05:51,639
(Doorbell)

90
00:05:52,557 --> 00:05:56,269
There's no need to panic.
l'm sure it's all part of the dance.

91
00:05:57,353 --> 00:06:00,064
The station sent me over
with your stuff.

92
00:06:00,231 --> 00:06:02,567
They've cleaned out my cubicle?

93
00:06:02,733 --> 00:06:06,195
You're up on the gossip.
They're bluffing, right?

94
00:06:06,362 --> 00:06:08,990
l hope not.
My audition went really well.

95
00:06:13,953 --> 00:06:16,122
Nurse Bebe reporting for duty.

96
00:06:16,289 --> 00:06:20,001
Blossoms for my little shut-in.
Put these in something.

97
00:06:21,085 --> 00:06:25,172
Have you heard what's going on?
They're auditioning other people.

98
00:06:25,339 --> 00:06:28,676
Marvellous!
They're resorting to cheap scare tactics.

99
00:06:28,843 --> 00:06:32,471
Looks like l was right
to bring this along. Chill that.

100
00:06:33,973 --> 00:06:36,225
Darling, you're looking pale.

101
00:06:36,392 --> 00:06:40,062
Don't tell me these amateur theatrics
are worrying you?

102
00:06:40,229 --> 00:06:44,984
Well, no, no, but the stress of not
worrying is starting to get to me.

103
00:06:45,151 --> 00:06:47,903
l don't know
if l can take much more of this.

104
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:51,407
Darling, if that's the way you feel,
then fine.

105
00:06:51,574 --> 00:06:53,826
Let's get this over with.

106
00:06:53,993 --> 00:06:57,329
Frasier, it's for the best.
Trust me on this one.

107
00:06:57,496 --> 00:07:00,833
Tom Duran, please.
Bebe Glaser calling.

108
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,919
Tom, Bebe's bored.

109
00:07:04,086 --> 00:07:07,423
You huffed and puffed,
but our house is still standing.

110
00:07:07,589 --> 00:07:09,633
We'll give you a midnight deadline.

111
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:14,763
Either call us at Frasier's and we'll
renegotiate or we'll walk! Love you.

112
00:07:16,306 --> 00:07:19,184
That should make them sweat.
Don't you think?

113
00:07:19,351 --> 00:07:21,395
lt might.

114
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:26,358
lt's all over, but the waiting.
Canasta, anyone?

115
00:07:26,525 --> 00:07:28,569
Shuffle these.

116
00:07:34,408 --> 00:07:36,034
1 1 :45.

117
00:07:37,244 --> 00:07:41,289
Oh, God. lt's over.
They've made the decision. lt's over.

118
00:07:44,501 --> 00:07:47,295
lt was a fun run while it lasted,
eh, Seattle?

119
00:07:47,462 --> 00:07:49,589
This is Dr Frasier Crane!

120
00:07:50,549 --> 00:07:52,592
And l was listening!

121
00:07:54,719 --> 00:07:56,763
Here we are.

122
00:07:56,930 --> 00:08:01,977
One tea, half-Darjeeling, half-camomile.
Skimmed milk and sweetener.

123
00:08:02,143 --> 00:08:07,941
l thought you'd enjoy a fat free tea
biscuit. Will there be anything else?

124
00:08:08,108 --> 00:08:11,403
- No. You run along. l'm fine.
- Are you sure?

125
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:16,199
l could wait until you finish the biscuit
and floss your teeth for you.

126
00:08:21,538 --> 00:08:24,541
You are a cheeky little monkey,
aren't you?

127
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:27,669
This cookie tastes like meat!

128
00:08:27,836 --> 00:08:32,132
Yes and it'll remove tartar
and give you a nice, shiny coat.

129
00:08:39,889 --> 00:08:42,267
l think l'm going to hit the hay, too.

130
00:08:42,433 --> 00:08:46,729
That's risky, isn't it? Leaving us kids
out here unchaperoned.

131
00:08:46,896 --> 00:08:48,940
Better him than me.

132
00:08:52,568 --> 00:08:54,821
Why are you so tense?

133
00:08:54,988 --> 00:08:58,741
This is the best part.
What could be more fun than this?

134
00:08:58,908 --> 00:09:01,619
Watching a loved one be autopsied?

135
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,791
Think of them, sweating in their offices,

136
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:09,377
chain-smoking, biting their nails,

137
00:09:09,544 --> 00:09:14,298
their ulcers churning out enough acid
to burn a hole in a ship's hull.

138
00:09:14,465 --> 00:09:16,509
Oh, God!

139
00:09:18,135 --> 00:09:20,930
And to think l nearly went into nursing.

140
00:09:22,974 --> 00:09:25,142
You're right, Bebe. You're right.

141
00:09:25,309 --> 00:09:27,812
lf they're foolish enough to let me go,

142
00:09:27,979 --> 00:09:31,357
other stations
would love to have Frasier Crane.

143
00:09:31,524 --> 00:09:33,985
- Exactly.
- Yes.

144
00:09:34,151 --> 00:09:38,864
But it's time to discuss other offers
and consider our fallback position.

145
00:09:39,031 --> 00:09:41,075
Ooh! Someone's out of Scotch.

146
00:09:45,329 --> 00:09:47,832
Bebe, tell me there are other offers.

147
00:09:47,998 --> 00:09:49,834
Scads!

148
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,128
Look me in the eye
and tell me the truth.

149
00:09:53,295 --> 00:09:57,508
There are no other offers.
Straight up or on the rocks?

150
00:09:57,675 --> 00:09:59,260
My God!

151
00:09:59,426 --> 00:10:03,097
Darling, you can't make a deal
without bluffing.

152
00:10:03,264 --> 00:10:05,599
You're supposed to bluff them,
not me!

153
00:10:06,684 --> 00:10:10,854
- Are you trying to ruin me?
- You are such a worrywart.

154
00:10:11,021 --> 00:10:15,609
Don't you patronise me,
you sweet-talking succubus. Call them.

155
00:10:15,776 --> 00:10:19,071
Ooh, my God. Hands of Hercules.

156
00:10:20,489 --> 00:10:22,533
What must your legs be like?

157
00:10:23,534 --> 00:10:25,577
(Phone rings)

158
00:10:25,744 --> 00:10:28,455
- Answer it.
- Not yet.

159
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:34,002
Where are we? Have we gone out?
ls it too late?

160
00:10:34,169 --> 00:10:36,213
(Shouts) Answer it! !

161
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:39,466
Crane residence.
Bebe Glaser speaking.

162
00:10:39,633 --> 00:10:43,095
lt's them. l see.

163
00:10:44,429 --> 00:10:46,264
l see.

164
00:10:47,766 --> 00:10:49,184
Fine.

165
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,563
Well?

166
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:56,858
Renegotiations tomorrow,
from scratch.

167
00:10:57,025 --> 00:11:01,196
Dear God! Oh. Oh, we did it.

168
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:07,410
Oh, my God, l'm so pleased.
Thank you, Bebe.

169
00:11:07,577 --> 00:11:10,539
Maybe next time you'll trust little Bebe.

170
00:11:10,705 --> 00:11:12,874
l'm sorry. l underestimated you.

171
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:16,461
l'm sorry for that outburst
and for grabbing you.

172
00:11:16,628 --> 00:11:19,547
Don't be. l was impressed.

173
00:11:19,714 --> 00:11:23,551
lt was manly
in a...hysterical sort of way.

174
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:26,888
Cheers.

175
00:11:27,972 --> 00:11:30,975
Champagne on top of Scotch.

176
00:11:31,142 --> 00:11:35,021
- What the hell!
- To a beautiful partnership.

177
00:11:35,188 --> 00:11:38,775
No.
To...a remarkable agent.

178
00:11:38,942 --> 00:11:43,112
What Bebe wants, Bebe gets.
When will l ever learn that?

179
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:46,074
Soon enough, dear.

180
00:11:47,534 --> 00:11:49,077
Soon enough.

181
00:12:09,305 --> 00:12:13,601
Sorry, Eddie, he's still alive.
You're not getting your own room.

182
00:12:15,853 --> 00:12:18,773
- How're you feeling?
- How do l look?

183
00:12:18,981 --> 00:12:21,025
The last time l saw
a guy who looked like you

184
00:12:21,192 --> 00:12:24,195
he'd been in the trunk of a car
for a month.

185
00:12:24,362 --> 00:12:26,614
Good morning!

186
00:12:26,781 --> 00:12:31,202
My goodness, christened
a few ships last night, l see.

187
00:12:31,369 --> 00:12:34,872
The station agreed to renegotiate.

188
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:40,169
- Oh, well done.
- They called around five to midnight.

189
00:12:40,336 --> 00:12:44,548
Bebe and l had some champagne
to celebrate and then...

190
00:12:45,633 --> 00:12:47,468
And then...

191
00:12:48,719 --> 00:12:50,554
Oh, God.

192
00:12:52,389 --> 00:12:54,433
Morning, Doctor.

193
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:01,524
Somebody hold me.

194
00:13:02,858 --> 00:13:05,569
l didn't see a robe and your shirt

195
00:13:05,736 --> 00:13:09,823
is so nice and big
and warm...just like you.

196
00:13:11,659 --> 00:13:16,497
l think l'll go in the other room
and eat my breakfast, while l still can.

197
00:13:17,581 --> 00:13:22,669
l'd better go cook for him. l know how
the Crane men like their legs...eggs.

198
00:13:24,463 --> 00:13:27,674
l think they were a little shocked.

199
00:13:27,841 --> 00:13:30,427
l'm a little surprised myself.

200
00:13:30,594 --> 00:13:34,890
Let's not kid ourselves. We both knew
this would happen someday.

201
00:13:35,057 --> 00:13:37,392
- We did?
- The signs were all there.

202
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:40,646
The glances, the furtive smiles.

203
00:13:40,812 --> 00:13:44,233
You know what would really hit
the spot right now?

204
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,361
My God, you're a machine!

205
00:13:50,405 --> 00:13:52,449
l meant coffee.

206
00:13:52,616 --> 00:13:54,242
(Doorbell)

207
00:13:54,409 --> 00:13:56,870
- l'll get it.
- That's not necessary.

208
00:13:57,954 --> 00:14:00,749
Good morning, Niles.
What a lovely surprise.

209
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:04,753
We were about to have breakfast.
Won't you join us?

210
00:14:05,587 --> 00:14:07,422
(Rings doorbell again)

211
00:14:10,842 --> 00:14:13,595
Come on in, Niles. lt's all right.

212
00:14:19,392 --> 00:14:24,731
We were celebrating. The station called
to renegotiate my contract.

213
00:14:24,898 --> 00:14:27,734
Paid your commission upfront, l see.

214
00:14:30,695 --> 00:14:34,741
lt's getting late. l'll freshen up.
Save me a muffin, muffin.

215
00:14:41,372 --> 00:14:44,375
Oh, all right. Go ahead.
Get your shots in.

216
00:14:44,542 --> 00:14:46,628
l'm just glad you're all right.

217
00:14:46,795 --> 00:14:49,214
l'd assumed she killed after mating.

218
00:14:55,595 --> 00:14:59,724
- ls she gone?
- No, Dad. She's changing.

219
00:14:59,891 --> 00:15:01,935
Oh, my God. How did this happen?

220
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:04,270
You're asking us?

221
00:15:04,437 --> 00:15:07,982
l've got to tell her
this was just a mistake.

222
00:15:08,149 --> 00:15:11,069
You'd better be careful.
She's liable to go nuts,

223
00:15:11,235 --> 00:15:14,322
like in that movie,
then try to boil Eddie.

224
00:15:19,243 --> 00:15:22,455
- We'll give you privacy.
- l can't tell her now.

225
00:15:22,622 --> 00:15:24,749
She's renegotiating my contract.

226
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:27,335
- l'll tell her later.
- What a good idea.

227
00:15:27,502 --> 00:15:32,423
Wait till she makes you money,
then you can make her feel really used.

228
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:34,634
Sounds like a plan to me.

229
00:15:35,593 --> 00:15:38,846
- Darling!
- We'll leave you to your happy task.

230
00:15:40,222 --> 00:15:44,977
Cancel that muffin,
Bebe just started a diet. Wink.

231
00:15:46,062 --> 00:15:48,981
Besides,
tonight we're dining at Bernardi's.

232
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:53,652
lt's sinfully expensive,
but after contract talks, we can afford it.

233
00:15:53,819 --> 00:15:56,655
- Bebe.
- Yes.

234
00:15:56,822 --> 00:16:02,828
Bebe, l don't think there are any words
to describe what we shared last night.

235
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:06,749
lt was like Greco-Roman wrestling
on a trampoline.

236
00:16:12,087 --> 00:16:14,882
As magical as it was,

237
00:16:15,049 --> 00:16:18,594
it's not the kind of thing
we should let happen again.

238
00:16:20,387 --> 00:16:25,934
l value you too much as a colleague
to jeopardise that relationship.

239
00:16:28,812 --> 00:16:31,774
- l see.
- Oh, you're upset.

240
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:34,610
We'd both have realised
sooner or later.

241
00:16:34,777 --> 00:16:37,863
l was hoping for later,
but sooner's best.

242
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:40,365
l'd better dash. l'll call you later.

243
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:50,959
Oh, like you never crawled under
the wrong fence once in your life!

244
00:16:57,174 --> 00:17:01,595
Disaster. Maris's wine club
had an outing to the local vineyard.

245
00:17:01,762 --> 00:17:04,347
As president, she was first into the vat.

246
00:17:05,348 --> 00:17:08,602
lmagine her humiliation
as she danced in a barefoot fury

247
00:17:08,769 --> 00:17:11,313
and was unable to break a single grape.

248
00:17:14,608 --> 00:17:16,735
Have you heard a word l've said?

249
00:17:16,902 --> 00:17:20,155
Of course not.
l'm still worried about Bebe.

250
00:17:20,322 --> 00:17:24,326
- You said she took it well.
- You know how strong women are.

251
00:17:24,492 --> 00:17:27,579
Sometimes strength
masks vulnerability.

252
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:34,085
Well, let's face it, once a woman
has dipped her toe into Crane Lake...

253
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:39,257
...dry land is never the same again.

254
00:17:40,383 --> 00:17:44,095
She's probably writing
Mrs Bebe Crane over and over

255
00:17:44,262 --> 00:17:46,306
in the margin of her algebra book.

256
00:17:46,473 --> 00:17:51,186
You can make light of this if you want,
but l may have broken her heart.

257
00:17:51,352 --> 00:17:54,856
- Whose heart did you break?
- No one! Niles, be quiet!

258
00:17:55,023 --> 00:17:59,319
l'm going to figure it out sooner or later.
Give me a clue. Just one.

259
00:17:59,485 --> 00:18:02,655
Doc! Bebe's on the ledge!
She's threatening to jump!

260
00:18:02,822 --> 00:18:06,701
- Oh, my God. This is all my fault!
- Wait! Just give me a hint!

261
00:18:12,373 --> 00:18:15,418
- Bebe, please!
- (Bebe sobs) Get away from me!

262
00:18:15,585 --> 00:18:17,879
Excuse me. What happened?

263
00:18:18,046 --> 00:18:22,508
l don't know. We were working out
your deal and she burst into tears.

264
00:18:22,675 --> 00:18:24,761
l went to get her water.
When l came back,

265
00:18:24,927 --> 00:18:28,598
she's out there,
sobbing she doesn't want to live.

266
00:18:33,811 --> 00:18:36,439
Bebe, it's Frasier. Please come in.

267
00:18:36,606 --> 00:18:40,276
lt's no good! My life is over!

268
00:18:40,443 --> 00:18:45,197
You gotta save her. My contract's up
in six weeks. She's my agent, too.

269
00:18:47,241 --> 00:18:49,618
- l'm going out there.
- Are you nuts?

270
00:18:49,785 --> 00:18:52,288
You know what the drop
would do to you?

271
00:18:52,455 --> 00:18:55,166
Toss a pumpkin out,
so l have a clear image.

272
00:18:55,332 --> 00:18:58,210
- Why don't you wait for the police?
- No. No.

273
00:18:58,377 --> 00:19:00,463
That woman out there needs me.

274
00:19:01,547 --> 00:19:06,469
- Bebe, l'm coming out.
- Don't come any closer. l'll jump!

275
00:19:06,635 --> 00:19:09,096
- Bebe, please.
- You can't help me!

276
00:19:09,263 --> 00:19:11,932
No one can help me!

277
00:19:12,099 --> 00:19:14,226
l'm not worth doing this over.

278
00:19:14,393 --> 00:19:16,645
Look, there'll be other men.

279
00:19:16,812 --> 00:19:19,398
lt may take time, but you'll get over me.

280
00:19:19,565 --> 00:19:22,109
Somebody thinks well of himself.

281
00:19:23,402 --> 00:19:24,820
What?

282
00:19:24,987 --> 00:19:28,949
This isn't about us.
lt's just a little bargaining tactic.

283
00:19:34,163 --> 00:19:36,665
l threaten to jump. You talk me down.

284
00:19:36,832 --> 00:19:39,418
Major coverage.
Bang! Your price goes up 20%.

285
00:19:39,585 --> 00:19:41,628
(Shouts) My life is meaningless! !

286
00:19:44,214 --> 00:19:46,884
Talk to me, darling. Talk to me.

287
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:49,845
- You're coming in right now.
- Stay away from me!

288
00:19:50,012 --> 00:19:52,055
You can't talk me out of this!

289
00:19:52,222 --> 00:19:55,392
At least
not until Channel Five gets here.

290
00:19:56,476 --> 00:19:58,895
Come on, dear. Make like a therapist.

291
00:19:59,062 --> 00:20:02,524
You're out of your mind.
You should be in therapy.

292
00:20:02,691 --> 00:20:08,697
That's good, but louder.
Give me one reason to live! Just one!

293
00:20:12,534 --> 00:20:14,578
Well, there are...

294
00:20:14,745 --> 00:20:17,038
...hundreds of reasons.

295
00:20:19,749 --> 00:20:22,544
Work, art,
the people who care about you.

296
00:20:22,711 --> 00:20:24,963
Now, come in, you crazy bitch!

297
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:30,552
(Helicopter circles)

298
00:20:33,138 --> 00:20:36,975
Channel Five, come to Mama!

299
00:20:38,727 --> 00:20:41,771
Here's the plan.
l swoon forward, you catch me.

300
00:20:41,938 --> 00:20:44,566
- What?
- On three. One, two...

301
00:20:44,733 --> 00:20:46,609
- No!
- ...three!

302
00:20:48,903 --> 00:20:50,947
Film at 1 1 :00.

303
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:56,327
Just get in.

304
00:20:57,745 --> 00:21:01,708
- Are you all right?
- Yes, l'm fine now.

305
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:05,712
Get her some water.
Do you want to sit down?

306
00:21:06,629 --> 00:21:10,758
Thank you, Frasier. You saved my life.

307
00:21:12,302 --> 00:21:14,721
That was incredible, Frasier.

308
00:21:14,887 --> 00:21:18,349
Look, l know we've got
some unfinished business,

309
00:21:18,516 --> 00:21:22,645
but after this, there's no way
we're going to let you get away.

310
00:21:22,812 --> 00:21:25,440
Well, thank you, Tom.

311
00:21:25,606 --> 00:21:29,777
lf l could just have
a moment alone with Bebe?

312
00:21:29,944 --> 00:21:31,779
Sure.

313
00:21:38,786 --> 00:21:41,205
What kind of a woman are you?

314
00:21:41,372 --> 00:21:44,250
You seduced me, lied to me.
nearly got me killed.

315
00:21:44,417 --> 00:21:46,794
You've shamelessly manipulated me,

316
00:21:46,961 --> 00:21:50,214
the station,
the media and the city of Seattle.

317
00:21:50,381 --> 00:21:53,467
What do you have to say for yourself?

318
00:21:55,052 --> 00:21:57,596
Aren't you glad l'm on your side?

319
00:22:05,062 --> 00:22:07,690
Yes, l suppose l am.

320
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:18,909
# Hey baby, l hear the blues are calling
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

321
00:22:19,076 --> 00:22:20,286
# Quite stylish!

322
00:22:20,452 --> 00:22:22,621
(Song continues over dialogue )

323
00:22:22,788 --> 00:22:27,459
# Maybe l seem a bit confused
Well, maybe...but l got you pegged!

324
00:22:27,626 --> 00:22:33,298
# But l don't know what to do with those
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

325
00:22:33,465 --> 00:22:35,926
# They're calling again #

326
00:22:36,093 --> 00:22:38,971
Good night, Seattle, we love you!
