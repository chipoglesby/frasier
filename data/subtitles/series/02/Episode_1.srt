1
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:13,639
(Frasier) Hello, Steven, I'm listening.

2
00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:19,645
(Steven) 'We're having a baby
and there seems to be different advice

3
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:23,941
'about whether it's OK to let your kid
get into bed with you in the morning. '

4
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:26,527
Stop right there, Steven. It's OK.

5
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:31,532
All relationships require close and
undivided attention, don't they, Roz?

6
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:32,991
Uh-huh.

7
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:39,331
'What if you and your wife
enjoy making love in the mornings? '

8
00:00:39,498 --> 00:00:44,545
Trust me, after the baby comes,
that won't be an issue any more.

9
00:00:45,504 --> 00:00:50,551
This is Dr Frasier Crane on KACL.
We'll be back after these messages.

10
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:53,303
Roz, how can you be reading now?

11
00:00:53,512 --> 00:00:57,891
It's something I picked up
in elementary school, and it stuck.

12
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:01,812
- What is so captivating?
- ''Slow Tango In South Seattle''.

13
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:04,815
Every woman I see
is carrying that book.

14
00:01:04,982 --> 00:01:08,986
It's impossible to put down.
Read the first paragraph.

15
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:11,613
I guarantee you'll be hooked.

16
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:17,703
''There are tangos that come flowing
from the wine-coloured sea...

17
00:01:18,871 --> 00:01:22,249
''from the rust
of a hundred sunken ships.

18
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:24,543
''This is one of those dances.''

19
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,130
- Well?
- There are books...

20
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:34,928
that make your stomach rumble
and thrust your lunch ever upward!

21
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:40,017
This is one of those books!

22
00:01:40,976 --> 00:01:44,104
You men are all alike -
you have no soul.

23
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:48,400
Except for this one - the future
Mr Roz Doyle, Thomas Jay Fallow.

24
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:51,153
- My God, it's him!
- Do you know him?

25
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:55,365
Yes. He used to drop into a bar
I frequented in Boston.

26
00:01:55,532 --> 00:02:00,120
A bit pretentious, though -
stuck out like a sore thumb.

27
00:02:00,996 --> 00:02:04,166
You used to drink
with Thomas Jay Fallow?

28
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:07,961
I helped him get through
his writer's block.

29
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:12,466
ln future, I'll remember
to use my powers for good, not evil.

30
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:15,177
I don't care what you think.

31
00:02:15,344 --> 00:02:19,348
He's on ''Bookchat'' tomorrow
and you're introducing him.

32
00:02:19,515 --> 00:02:24,311
No! I'd have to say I liked his book.
It's hard to lie to someone's face.

33
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:29,858
No, it's easy for someone as bright,
charming and articulate as you.

34
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:32,736
Well, perhaps you're right.

35
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:36,490
See how easy it is?

36
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:41,787
(Eddie growls)

37
00:02:41,954 --> 00:02:48,752
- Eight, nine... Stop it, Eddie!
- He just wants to play.

38
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:52,422
Yeah, well, therapy is not a game.
Stop it! Stop it, I said!

39
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:54,508
(Doorbell rings)

40
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:58,554
If he keeps this up,
there's no point to these exercises.

41
00:02:58,762 --> 00:03:00,180
Attaboy!

42
00:03:02,224 --> 00:03:04,184
- Hello, Dr Crane.
- Hello, Daphne.

43
00:03:04,393 --> 00:03:07,646
- Hey, Niles!
- Ah, doing your exercises.

44
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:10,315
Yes, and if someone doesn't let us
get on with them,

45
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:13,777
he'll get a spank on his fanny.

46
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,664
Don't...don't let me...

47
00:03:25,831 --> 00:03:29,877
- Unless you want to!
- What's up?

48
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:36,216
ln your room, I noticed you had
pictures of Frasier and Frederick

49
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:41,471
and an autographed one from someone
named Ken Griffey Jr, but...

50
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,975
none of Maris and me.
So I brought you this.

51
00:03:45,184 --> 00:03:47,019
Thanks.

52
00:03:47,186 --> 00:03:51,023
Why is Maris wearing jodhpurs?
Taken up horse riding?

53
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:54,359
No, she wanted to,
but her quadriceps are so tight

54
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:58,405
she can't straddle anything
larger than a Border collie.

55
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:09,249
- I can't believe this!
- What are you yapping about?

56
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:12,544
This book!
It's written by a man I knew.

57
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:16,256
He's taken something
I told him in confidence

58
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:19,092
and turned it into this trash!

59
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:22,429
''Slow Tango''?
I've just started reading that.

60
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:26,225
You mean to tell me
that young man is based on you?

61
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:30,437
Yes. But did Thomas Jay Fallow
have the grace to thank me? No!

62
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:33,857
- Not even in the acknowledgements!
- What's it about?

63
00:04:34,066 --> 00:04:37,277
- That is not important.
- His first time.

64
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:44,117
- Thank you, Daphne!
- Your first time doing what?

65
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:49,623
Changing a flat tyre!

66
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:56,004
So this whole book's about
the night you conceived Frederick!

67
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:59,675
You'll be happy to know
that was not my first time.

68
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:02,594
And that it wasn't your only time!

69
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:09,017
- Who was this charitable lass?
- That is not important.

70
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:12,104
- His piano teacher.
- His piano teacher?

71
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,356
Thanks again, Daphne!

72
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:18,735
It's no secret.
It's all there in black and white.

73
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:21,405
About your awkward teenage lunging,

74
00:05:21,572 --> 00:05:25,242
and how you used to call
your chest hair your ''rug of love''.

75
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:29,830
He did take some literary licence.

76
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:35,919
So you can't bring a woman to ecstasy
with your panther-like prowess?

77
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:40,174
That part he got right.

78
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:44,928
This really fries me. That woman
taking advantage of my kid.

79
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:49,600
I paid $1 0 a week for piano lessons
so you could get your hedge trimmed.

80
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:55,439
Wait a minute!
Not Miss Warner?

81
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:59,193
This wasn't going on
during your lessons, too?

82
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:04,656
No, while Frasier was getting his
Rachmaninoffs, I was studying music!

83
00:06:05,616 --> 00:06:10,787
Now, look! This was not some tawdry
older woman lusting after young flesh!

84
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:15,459
Clarice and I cared for each other.

85
00:06:15,626 --> 00:06:18,712
She showed me a world
I'd never known.

86
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:23,133
And wouldn't know again
for six and a half years.

87
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:30,724
It's true. As Mr Fallow put it,
she saw your sensitive, poetic side

88
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:35,312
and you couldn't help noticing
how her bosom brushed your cheek

89
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:37,523
when she reached for the metronome.

90
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:42,069
How can a man who drank so heavily
remember so much?

91
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:48,116
- Yet forgets who told him the story.
- He'll get a little reminder today.

92
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:52,621
- No, no!
- I want it. Give it to me.

93
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:56,834
''I budded when you kissed me.

94
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,419
''I withered when you left me.

95
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:03,006
''I bloomed a few months
while you loved me.''

96
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:07,261
- Would you calm down?
- When I've exacted my pound of flesh.

97
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,471
Wait till I get my book signed.

98
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:12,474
- Let me. It's my story.
- Stop it!

99
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:16,520
You haven't told anyone?
They'd have a field day.

100
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:20,274
Frasier, give me credit
for a little discretion.

101
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:24,486
Hey, piano boy!
Way to pound those ivories!

102
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:31,451
Listen! It's imperative
that this not be commonly known.

103
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:33,912
Hey, Doc, it's no big deal.

104
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:41,170
Anything for you? I've still got some
feeling on the other side of my head.

105
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:44,173
I had a similar experience
when I was 1 6.

106
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:48,093
An older woman introduced me
to the mysteries of love.

107
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,971
Of course, she was a hooker.

108
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:54,308
It was a birthday present
from my dad, OK?

109
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:57,394
Want to know the ironic thing?

110
00:07:57,561 --> 00:08:00,355
All I wanted was a bike.

111
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:07,738
How could you expect me
not to tell anybody?

112
00:08:07,905 --> 00:08:12,367
You can't keep something like that
bottled up. I only told one person.

113
00:08:12,576 --> 00:08:15,412
- Hello, Frasier, Roz!
- Hi.

114
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:19,583
I was doing my restaurant review
this afternoon

115
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:24,254
when I came up with the
perfect sandwich, named after you:

116
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:26,465
Frasier Crane's Double Decker.

117
00:08:26,632 --> 00:08:31,512
It consists of aged pheasant,
spring chicken and plenty of tongue.

118
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:37,601
Listen! ''I wept as our bodies
made the music of love.''

119
00:08:37,768 --> 00:08:40,604
''I'm your rhapsody. Play me.''

120
00:08:40,771 --> 00:08:44,316
''Crescendo, my young maestro,
crescendo.''

121
00:08:44,483 --> 00:08:49,029
''My vessel yearns to dock
in the magnificence of your harbour.''

122
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:52,407
That's not in the book.

123
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:56,203
One thing I must ask you -

124
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:59,915
what was your inspiration
for this love story?

125
00:09:00,082 --> 00:09:02,209
Ooh! It's his last chance!

126
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:06,505
It was actually given to me by God.

127
00:09:06,672 --> 00:09:08,757
By God!

128
00:09:08,924 --> 00:09:13,011
Do you believe his grandiosity?
I'm God, and he knows it!

129
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:17,474
We'll be back with the divinely inspired
Thomas Jay Fallow

130
00:09:17,683 --> 00:09:19,810
right after this break.

131
00:09:21,395 --> 00:09:27,484
Excuse me. I want to call my husband
and see if he can take a long lunch.

132
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:33,448
Thomas Jay Fallow.

133
00:09:34,867 --> 00:09:36,743
Frasier!

134
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,496
Frasier Crane! I can't believe it!

135
00:09:39,663 --> 00:09:43,709
I see my name hasn't entirely escaped
your sieve-like memory.

136
00:09:43,876 --> 00:09:47,921
- Why would it?
- It's not in your acknowledgements,

137
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:50,549
you egomaniacal thief!

138
00:09:50,716 --> 00:09:53,093
You read my book!

139
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:56,638
I didn't have to read it. I lived it.

140
00:09:56,805 --> 00:10:00,809
Not that anybody would know that
from your acknowledgements.

141
00:10:00,976 --> 00:10:04,605
You mention your kindergarten teacher,
but not me!

142
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:07,691
I only gave you the story
which you have merchandised

143
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:11,695
into this $1 ,000,000 treacle machine!

144
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:15,782
I'm finished now.

145
00:10:17,201 --> 00:10:19,244
I'm so sorry.

146
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:24,041
I don't know how I could have been
so thoughtless.

147
00:10:29,713 --> 00:10:32,549
- I owe you everything!
- Oh, no, no!

148
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:38,972
Oh, my God! Frasier,
what did you do to the poor man?

149
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:43,727
- What happened?
- Frasier made him cry.

150
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:52,694
''Slow Tango'' has put thoughts
in Maris' head.

151
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:56,782
I found her cooing over the student
who skims the koi pond.

152
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:01,787
- I wouldn't concern myself.
- It's innocent flirting?

153
00:11:01,954 --> 00:11:04,790
No. I just wouldn't concern myself.

154
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:11,213
- Hey, Frasier.
- Hi, Dad, Niles.

155
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:17,719
Congratulations. Maris heard Thomas
Fallow acknowledge his debt to you.

156
00:11:17,928 --> 00:11:21,056
Yes, I had a chat with him
this afternoon.

157
00:11:21,223 --> 00:11:24,434
- Was he properly contrite?
- I made him cry.

158
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:26,728
That's my boy!

159
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:31,233
You must be feeling pretty good.

160
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:35,863
Actually, the incident
has left me strangely unsatisfied.

161
00:11:37,281 --> 00:11:42,661
I still feel sort of empty. I've been
turning it around in my mind all day.

162
00:11:42,828 --> 00:11:47,249
You kill me. You got what you want
and you're still not happy.

163
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:51,003
Frasier, life is not hard.
You make it hard.

164
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:55,632
You don't just enjoy things.
You analyse everything.

165
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:57,217
(Eddie growls)

166
00:11:57,384 --> 00:12:01,096
You could learn a big lesson
from this dog here.

167
00:12:01,263 --> 00:12:04,975
You know what makes him happy?
A sock.

168
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:08,103
Come on, Eddie.

169
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:15,944
What's troubling you goes deeper
than your usual malaise.

170
00:12:16,111 --> 00:12:19,615
- (Daphne ) Shame on you!
- What for?

171
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:21,909
You just ran out on her!

172
00:12:22,117 --> 00:12:26,205
''Leaving her bed as empty
as a swallow's nest in fall.''

173
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:29,500
And you ask me what for!

174
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:34,671
I'd just been accepted to Harvard.

175
00:12:34,922 --> 00:12:39,134
So you just leave in the night
without so much as a kiss.

176
00:12:39,343 --> 00:12:43,222
- You never said goodbye?
- She was sleeping so peacefully.

177
00:12:45,307 --> 00:12:47,559
She had an early lesson.

178
00:12:49,645 --> 00:12:51,688
I left a rose on her pillow.

179
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:54,691
- Aha.
- ''Aha'' what?

180
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:59,238
- ''Aha'' this: I have a theory.
- Why else would you say ''aha''?

181
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:03,534
You were angry at Thomas Fallow
for not thanking you

182
00:13:03,742 --> 00:13:08,038
for your contribution to his life.
But you're really angry at yourself

183
00:13:08,205 --> 00:13:12,000
for not thanking Miss Warner
for her contribution to your life.

184
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,796
I was only 1 7.
I'm sure she understood.

185
00:13:16,505 --> 00:13:20,759
Perhaps she didn't. She was
vulnerable, lonely, middle-aged.

186
00:13:20,926 --> 00:13:23,929
It's possible her feelings for you
ran deep,

187
00:13:24,054 --> 00:13:28,600
feelings you crushed when you left
without a thank you or a goodbye.

188
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:31,436
Yes, well, thank you and goodbye.

189
00:13:34,106 --> 00:13:38,569
All right. Fine.
I'll just leave you with this thought:

190
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:42,030
your encounter with Fallow
was unsatisfactory

191
00:13:42,197 --> 00:13:44,241
because it didn't provide closure.

192
00:13:44,408 --> 00:13:49,163
For that, you will have to make amends
with Miss Warner. Aha.

193
00:13:57,379 --> 00:13:59,631
Very funny, Dad!

194
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:06,263
(Frasier)
''He had been a teenage Balboa,

195
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:11,935
''an explorer of the rising pinnacles
and gently curving slopes of my body.

196
00:14:12,144 --> 00:14:15,063
''ln one explosive burst of discovery,

197
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:19,610
''he had staked claim to
the Pacific Ocean that was my soul.

198
00:14:19,818 --> 00:14:22,112
''But now, he was leaving,

199
00:14:22,321 --> 00:14:27,659
''going, vanishing, like
a solitary boat on the lonely horizon,

200
00:14:27,826 --> 00:14:32,122
''departing like a train,
rolling ceaselessly through the night,

201
00:14:32,289 --> 00:14:34,791
''exiting swiftly like...''

202
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:50,807
''And so, he was gone.''

203
00:15:01,235 --> 00:15:05,531
''Now, in the cool of the evening,
I play my piano,

204
00:15:05,697 --> 00:15:08,909
''and his last words
resonate through the notes:

205
00:15:09,243 --> 00:15:13,330
''I'll come back to you,
my cherished one.'

206
00:15:14,248 --> 00:15:16,625
''But he never did.

207
00:15:16,792 --> 00:15:19,962
''And all that remains of him
are the withered petals

208
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:23,924
''of the rose he left upon my pillow.''

209
00:15:39,523 --> 00:15:42,651
(''The Blue Danube'' plays)

210
00:15:50,701 --> 00:15:52,578
Clarice.

211
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,373
Time, the subtle thief of youth.

212
00:16:09,219 --> 00:16:12,055
Hello. May I help you?

213
00:16:12,306 --> 00:16:15,142
- Ms Warner?
- Yes.

214
00:16:15,392 --> 00:16:18,645
I... I'm Frasier Crane.

215
00:16:20,147 --> 00:16:23,692
I'm sorry,
my memory's not what it used to be.

216
00:16:23,859 --> 00:16:26,278
But, please, come in.

217
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:30,490
- Would you like to sit down?
- Yes, I would.

218
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:34,286
So, we know each other?

219
00:16:35,454 --> 00:16:39,082
Well, we were friends.

220
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:43,337
More than friends.
You really don't remember?

221
00:16:43,504 --> 00:16:46,673
I'm trying.

222
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:52,179
You must have some recollection
of a fair-haired boy outside your door?

223
00:16:52,346 --> 00:16:55,933
At the piano?
On the piano?

224
00:16:59,436 --> 00:17:01,522
No, I'm sorry.

225
00:17:02,564 --> 00:17:06,026
Before the memories
come flooding back to you...

226
00:17:08,403 --> 00:17:13,283
I should tell you we had a romance
that didn't have a happy ending.

227
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:20,123
That's why I'm here.

228
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:25,879
Our last evening together,
we walked through a summer storm

229
00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:29,716
and I kissed the raindrops
off your nose

230
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:32,636
and promised we'd always be together.

231
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:36,265
But I broke that promise.

232
00:17:36,431 --> 00:17:40,936
You helped a shy adolescent
take his first steps to becoming a man

233
00:17:41,103 --> 00:17:45,732
and I repaid you by running off
and leaving you with just memories.

234
00:17:45,941 --> 00:17:49,361
And not many of those, either.

235
00:17:50,487 --> 00:17:54,283
- Can you ever forgive me?
- Oh, you're so sweet!

236
00:17:54,449 --> 00:17:58,579
- Of course I can forgive you.
- Thank you.

237
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:01,707
It's such a relief
to get that off my chest.

238
00:18:01,874 --> 00:18:06,086
- (Woman) 'Mother? I'm going now!'
- You run along, Clarice!

239
00:18:06,253 --> 00:18:07,796
Clarice?

240
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:10,591
Excuse me.

241
00:18:10,841 --> 00:18:14,428
Dear, this is Frasier Crane.

242
00:18:14,595 --> 00:18:17,598
Apparently, we were
quite an item once.

243
00:18:21,018 --> 00:18:25,147
Frasier Crane?
What are you doing here?

244
00:18:26,273 --> 00:18:29,151
Obviously,
making an enormous mistake.

245
00:18:31,195 --> 00:18:34,281
Mother, would you get us
some iced tea?

246
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:38,744
She's getting rid of me,
but I'll be back.

247
00:18:43,165 --> 00:18:45,125
My God!

248
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,753
I can't believe you're here.

249
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:51,590
- It's got to be 20...
- 25.

250
00:18:51,757 --> 00:18:54,927
25 years!

251
00:18:55,761 --> 00:18:57,846
And look at you!

252
00:18:58,013 --> 00:19:00,682
Look at you! You look incredible.

253
00:19:00,849 --> 00:19:03,852
Well, sure, compared to my mother.

254
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,854
No.

255
00:19:07,606 --> 00:19:09,983
That's not what I mean.

256
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:11,985
You look...

257
00:19:12,277 --> 00:19:16,156
- stunning.
- Well, thank you.

258
00:19:16,323 --> 00:19:20,619
And you, you've become
a very handsome man.

259
00:19:21,954 --> 00:19:25,707
- And successful, too.
- Thank you.

260
00:19:30,254 --> 00:19:33,298
You're here because of that book,
aren't you?

261
00:19:33,465 --> 00:19:36,802
Yes, and I'd like to apologise
right off.

262
00:19:38,846 --> 00:19:43,267
I told that story in confidence.
lt was never meant to be in print.

263
00:19:43,433 --> 00:19:46,854
There's no need to apologise.

264
00:19:47,062 --> 00:19:50,774
That was a lovely time in my life.

265
00:19:51,984 --> 00:19:54,403
It was nice to relive it.

266
00:20:01,577 --> 00:20:05,205
So...are you married?

267
00:20:05,914 --> 00:20:09,668
- Divorced. You?
- I never married.

268
00:20:11,378 --> 00:20:15,007
I came to apologise
about more than just the book.

269
00:20:17,426 --> 00:20:20,888
I never felt quite right
about the way I left things.

270
00:20:21,096 --> 00:20:25,434
I abandoned you.
It was selfish and cowardly.

271
00:20:25,601 --> 00:20:29,813
Oh, Frasier, relax.

272
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:34,109
I always felt guilty for short-changing
you on your music lessons.

273
00:20:38,447 --> 00:20:40,741
Do you still keep it up?

274
00:20:45,287 --> 00:20:48,415
Oh, the piano? Yes.

275
00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:56,965
I was so nervous about coming here
and now it just feels like old times.

276
00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:00,093
Sit at middle C.

277
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:04,556
Then...the metronome.

278
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:08,936
(Metronome ticks)

279
00:21:10,687 --> 00:21:14,483
I, well...
Maybe I should get going.

280
00:21:17,277 --> 00:21:22,366
At the risk of sounding forward,
would you have a coffee with me?

281
00:21:22,574 --> 00:21:25,244
Thanks, but I'll have to say no.

282
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:28,038
The age difference
is no longer an issue.

283
00:21:28,205 --> 00:21:29,748
(Door knocks)

284
00:21:30,415 --> 00:21:34,253
- Hi, honey. Ready to go?
- I'll be right out.

285
00:21:39,967 --> 00:21:42,177
- Are you and he...?
- Uh-huh.

286
00:21:42,344 --> 00:21:47,891
I wasn't interested in 40-year-old
men then and I guess I'm still not.

287
00:21:48,058 --> 00:21:50,394
It's great to see you again, though.

288
00:21:50,561 --> 00:21:52,229
Bye, Mom!

289
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:00,320
Good. Now we're alone.

290
00:22:04,408 --> 00:22:08,078
See what I did?
I put a raindrop on my nose!

291
00:22:14,459 --> 00:22:19,923
# Hey baby, I hear the blues are calling
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

292
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:21,592
# Oh, my!

293
00:22:21,758 --> 00:22:28,599
# And maybe I seem a bit confused
Well, maybe...but I got you pegged!

294
00:22:28,765 --> 00:22:33,896
# But I don't know what to do with those
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

295
00:22:34,104 --> 00:22:37,357
# They're calling again #

296
00:22:37,524 --> 00:22:40,277
Good night, Seattle, we love you!
