1
00:00:09,192 --> 00:00:14,781
ln this critic's opinion, Mickey's
Good Time Tavern is anything but.

2
00:00:14,948 --> 00:00:17,576
Dismal decor, perfunctory service,

3
00:00:17,742 --> 00:00:21,663
and cuisine only marginally
preferable to hunger.

4
00:00:22,539 --> 00:00:24,624
And finally, on a sadder note,

5
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:29,629
after 53 years,
Orsini's is closing its doors.

6
00:00:29,796 --> 00:00:34,426
Tonight, a sad adieu to the
grande dame of Seattle restaurants.

7
00:00:34,593 --> 00:00:38,638
l thought he was the grande dame
of Seattle restaurants.

8
00:00:38,805 --> 00:00:40,807
This is Gil Chesterton saying,

9
00:00:40,974 --> 00:00:45,270
<i>''Bon appetit, buon appetito
and nifty noshing.''</i>

10
00:00:47,105 --> 00:00:50,859
- Why is Orsini's closing?
- The owner wants to sell.

11
00:00:51,025 --> 00:00:56,614
And Orsini's is like wine
that's stayed too long in the cellar -

12
00:00:56,781 --> 00:00:59,242
only memories of its former glory.

13
00:00:59,409 --> 00:01:02,370
- Not comping your cheque?
- Not for months now.

14
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:07,625
Orsini's was my favourite restaurant.
Ever been?

15
00:01:07,792 --> 00:01:10,628
My typical date's idea
of a gourmet evening

16
00:01:10,795 --> 00:01:14,340
is take out, make out
and home by Letterman.

17
00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:20,013
- Knock, knock.
- Show starts in two minutes.

18
00:01:20,179 --> 00:01:24,475
Look at the John Steinbeck l bought
at the rare book fair.

19
00:01:24,642 --> 00:01:27,520
''St Katy The Virgin'',
in like-new condition.

20
00:01:27,687 --> 00:01:30,356
She'd have to be, wouldn't she?

21
00:01:31,441 --> 00:01:34,152
lt's a shame
more people haven't read it.

22
00:01:34,318 --> 00:01:38,447
- Let's see.
- Don't! You'll decrease its value.

23
00:01:38,614 --> 00:01:41,367
A thriving nightspot is closing its doors.

24
00:01:41,534 --> 00:01:44,036
Roz, you're moving.

25
00:01:53,587 --> 00:01:56,173
No, Orsini's is closing.

26
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,969
lt can't be!
lt's part of Crane history!

27
00:02:00,136 --> 00:02:04,056
Grandfather took me there
for my eighth birthday.

28
00:02:06,058 --> 00:02:08,894
- Thanks, Roz.
- Such vivid memories.

29
00:02:09,061 --> 00:02:11,272
Paper hats, singing Happy Birthday,

30
00:02:11,438 --> 00:02:14,483
sending back the veal Prince Orloff.

31
00:02:17,027 --> 00:02:19,071
30 seconds.

32
00:02:19,238 --> 00:02:22,658
Let's go to Orsini's
for a glorious farewell dinner.

33
00:02:22,825 --> 00:02:26,954
l'll make reservations.
We'll take Dad and Daphne.

34
00:02:27,121 --> 00:02:29,248
- Will Maris join us?
- Sadly no.

35
00:02:29,415 --> 00:02:33,252
One Christmas Eve
an ltalian soccer team was there.

36
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:37,715
Maris announced she was in the mood
for a goose and tragedy ensued.

37
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:03,615
Dear God.
What has happened to this place?

38
00:03:03,782 --> 00:03:08,078
lt's like running into a movie star
you once worshipped,

39
00:03:08,245 --> 00:03:13,250
only time has left her hair brittle,
her eyes sunken and dull,

40
00:03:13,417 --> 00:03:17,295
her skin waxy and sallow.

41
00:03:18,463 --> 00:03:21,091
l've got an appetite.
How about you, Daph?

42
00:03:22,008 --> 00:03:24,511
Yes, sir. Do you have a reservation?

43
00:03:24,678 --> 00:03:27,055
Yes. The name's Crane. For four.

44
00:03:27,597 --> 00:03:32,727
Table nine seems to be free.
Right this way, sir.

45
00:03:32,894 --> 00:03:37,607
- Your waiter will be here in a moment.
- Thank you. Here, Daphne.

46
00:03:37,774 --> 00:03:41,695
- Thank you.
- Dad, Frasier, isn't that Otto?

47
00:03:41,861 --> 00:03:45,073
My God, l believe it is!
Otto is legendary here.

48
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:49,452
He never writes anything down.
He keeps it all in his head. Otto!

49
00:03:49,619 --> 00:03:52,122
Coming up.

50
00:03:54,082 --> 00:03:56,126
Your cheque, sir.

51
00:03:59,129 --> 00:04:02,173
Wrong table. We'd like menus, please.

52
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:05,009
Sorry.
l hate it when we get crowded.

53
00:04:07,345 --> 00:04:09,806
l'm going to the john. Order me a beer.

54
00:04:09,973 --> 00:04:13,977
l thought you might surprise me
and order a glass of wine.

55
00:04:14,143 --> 00:04:17,605
l thought you might surprise me
and button your yap.

56
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:22,986
l'd order him the crab cocktail
but the irony would be lost on him.

57
00:04:24,654 --> 00:04:27,573
They'll have trouble finding a buyer.

58
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:32,995
Yes. One old relic whose time
has come to be put out of his misery.

59
00:04:33,162 --> 00:04:35,623
Oh, no, Otto, l didn't mean you.

60
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:38,835
- Your menu, sir.
- Thank you.

61
00:04:39,001 --> 00:04:41,796
- Lovely.
- Thank you.

62
00:04:41,963 --> 00:04:45,049
- He's in the men's room.
- No, Otto!

63
00:04:46,968 --> 00:04:49,011
Leave it here.

64
00:04:53,015 --> 00:04:56,435
Why do Americans always
rush to tear things down?

65
00:04:56,602 --> 00:05:02,441
At home, we treasure antiquities.
You just bring in bulldozers.

66
00:05:02,608 --> 00:05:06,612
- l agree with Daphne.
- l'll try to contain my amazement.

67
00:05:08,114 --> 00:05:11,325
lt's a crime to lose such a landmark.

68
00:05:11,492 --> 00:05:13,619
lt's well-built, good structure.

69
00:05:13,786 --> 00:05:17,581
lt does have good bones.
lt's in a good location.

70
00:05:17,748 --> 00:05:21,710
- lf they only had valet parking.
- lf they took down those curtains.

71
00:05:21,877 --> 00:05:24,338
Knocked out these pillars.

72
00:05:25,256 --> 00:05:30,761
You know...l've always dreamed
of owning a four-star restaurant.

73
00:05:30,928 --> 00:05:33,389
What growing boy hasn't?

74
00:05:34,473 --> 00:05:39,186
- We'd need a new chef.
- The chef at Emilio's is unhappy.

75
00:05:39,353 --> 00:05:42,356
Yes! The man's scungili
is a cry for help.

76
00:05:43,232 --> 00:05:45,859
Are you thinking what l'm thinking?

77
00:05:46,026 --> 00:05:49,571
l'm picking out china
and sandblasting the wine cave.

78
00:05:50,364 --> 00:05:56,119
lt can be hard work - if you don't
scald yourself or lop off a finger,

79
00:05:56,286 --> 00:05:59,122
you're gagging at grease fires,

80
00:05:59,289 --> 00:06:02,876
killing rats and brawling
with labour racketeers.

81
00:06:04,503 --> 00:06:07,422
Me auntie had a little tearoom.

82
00:06:09,466 --> 00:06:14,012
You're not gonna do a dumb-ass thing
like buying this place?

83
00:06:14,179 --> 00:06:17,432
With all respect,
we're not neophytes in this field.

84
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:22,437
- We know food and wine.
- We have style, taste and refinement.

85
00:06:22,604 --> 00:06:27,484
But you guys never think about
the hard work or the long hours.

86
00:06:27,651 --> 00:06:31,154
To you, owing a restaurant
is fancy clothes,

87
00:06:31,321 --> 00:06:34,616
hobnobbing with friends
and turning enemies away.

88
00:06:34,783 --> 00:06:37,244
l hadn't even thought about that!

89
00:06:38,328 --> 00:06:41,623
When l was a cop,
there was this restaurant.

90
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:44,834
ln 1 0 years, it changed hands 20 times.

91
00:06:45,001 --> 00:06:49,464
lt was Ling Fung's Lychee Palace,
then Tony's Meatball Hutch,

92
00:06:49,631 --> 00:06:52,801
then, A Taste Of Yorkshire -
English food.

93
00:06:52,967 --> 00:06:56,221
Big surprise -
that lasted about five minutes.

94
00:06:57,597 --> 00:07:00,600
He's right. People lose money
in this business

95
00:07:00,767 --> 00:07:03,520
because they pick the wrong name.

96
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:09,484
But l was thinking about it
while Dad was talking.

97
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:16,157
Maison Crane.
You're right, it's too obvious.

98
00:07:16,324 --> 00:07:19,077
We want our name to be inviting.

99
00:07:20,119 --> 00:07:23,373
What's the word for ''light-hearted''
in French?

100
00:07:23,539 --> 00:07:25,667
There isn't one.

101
00:07:26,626 --> 00:07:28,670
l've got it, Niles!

102
00:07:28,836 --> 00:07:31,381
Les Frères Heureux.

103
00:07:31,547 --> 00:07:34,384
The Happy Brothers! Brilliant!

104
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:38,721
Homey and just hard enough
to pronounce to intimidate riffraff.

105
00:07:39,972 --> 00:07:42,183
We'll make it very exclusive.

106
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:46,145
No sign, no advertising,
and an unlisted phone number.

107
00:07:46,312 --> 00:07:49,106
And you could post guards on the roof

108
00:07:49,273 --> 00:07:52,151
to shoot people as they try to get in!

109
00:07:53,569 --> 00:07:56,030
- l believe. Do you believe?
- l believe.

110
00:07:56,197 --> 00:08:02,286
- What would you like?
- The whole damned place!

111
00:08:02,453 --> 00:08:04,997
And for the lady?

112
00:08:10,753 --> 00:08:12,797
(Up tempo piano music plays)

113
00:08:25,726 --> 00:08:27,937
(Niles) We're a palpable hit.

114
00:08:28,103 --> 00:08:34,235
We're full, except for that table in that
dank corner next to the men's room.

115
00:08:34,401 --> 00:08:40,240
That is not a dank corner.
That is the enchanted grotto.

116
00:08:40,407 --> 00:08:42,910
l've had nothing but compliments.

117
00:08:43,077 --> 00:08:47,414
Chef Maurice has outdone himself.
The menu cannot be improved upon.

118
00:08:47,581 --> 00:08:52,544
Unless it would be to add a soupçon
of brandy to the Cherries Jubilee.

119
00:08:55,923 --> 00:08:58,842
l want those cherries to be jubilant.

120
00:09:00,761 --> 00:09:02,888
Daphne, Dad, everything OK?

121
00:09:03,055 --> 00:09:07,017
<i>Oh, yes. Whatever this anguilla is,
it's smashing.</i>

122
00:09:07,184 --> 00:09:10,938
Our chef can do things with eels
you wouldn't believe.

123
00:09:11,104 --> 00:09:13,232
l arrested a guy for that once.

124
00:09:15,025 --> 00:09:17,110
You really pulled it off, Dr Crane.

125
00:09:17,277 --> 00:09:22,199
Sorry to disappoint you, Dad, but
it seems the restaurant is a success.

126
00:09:22,366 --> 00:09:25,619
By tomorrow,
it'll be the toast of Seattle.

127
00:09:31,249 --> 00:09:33,293
<i>- What's in there?
- Anguilla.</i>

128
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:35,128
Dear God!

129
00:09:35,295 --> 00:09:40,717
Maurice likes to kill them to order,
then serve them with the heads on.

130
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,596
Thank God his speciality
isn't roast beef.

131
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,435
- Are those soufflés for table nine?
- l'm about to bake them.

132
00:09:50,602 --> 00:09:53,521
l shouldn't second-guess presentation,

133
00:09:53,688 --> 00:09:57,275
but would you be averse to trying
something radical?

134
00:09:57,442 --> 00:09:58,818
What?

135
00:09:58,985 --> 00:10:05,158
lnstead of individual soufflés, bake a
large soufflé and serve it at the table.

136
00:10:05,325 --> 00:10:09,537
When people hear ''Niles Crane'',
l want them to think ''big soufflé''.

137
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,916
As you wish.

138
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:19,005
- There's a party without a reservation.
- Leave them to me.

139
00:10:19,172 --> 00:10:21,507
Hey, Niles, baby!

140
00:10:21,674 --> 00:10:26,387
- Mr Briscoe. May l help you?
- Does it look like l need help?

141
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,724
Do you have a reservation?

142
00:10:29,891 --> 00:10:33,895
l know what you're sniffing for.
These guys are all alike.

143
00:10:34,062 --> 00:10:38,191
Mr Lincoln wonders if you've
a table for me and the lady.

144
00:10:38,358 --> 00:10:40,401
Mr Lincoln's in luck.

145
00:10:40,568 --> 00:10:44,113
Please seat these people
in the enchanted grotto.

146
00:10:45,073 --> 00:10:49,952
The grotto? Oh, Bulldog!
Enjoy our finest table.

147
00:10:51,412 --> 00:10:54,415
A flash of green
and you get what you want.

148
00:10:54,582 --> 00:10:56,834
But look who l'm telling!

149
00:11:06,177 --> 00:11:09,847
Maurice? lt's not to
second-guess your creativity,

150
00:11:10,014 --> 00:11:16,645
but...l thought we agreed we'd
serve the soufflé in individual cups?

151
00:11:16,812 --> 00:11:19,482
- l was asked to change.
- On opening night?

152
00:11:19,648 --> 00:11:22,568
Good Lord, no.
Start pouring, man.

153
00:11:25,613 --> 00:11:29,200
lf you're almost finished,
l'll call for your car.

154
00:11:29,366 --> 00:11:31,827
Your parking attendant
looked familiar.

155
00:11:31,994 --> 00:11:36,123
lt was Otto, the waiter.
Didn't have the heart to let him go.

156
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:40,210
- Hello, Otto.
- (Otto ) 'Who is this?'

157
00:11:41,253 --> 00:11:43,964
lt's Dr Crane. Please bring up car 44.

158
00:11:45,591 --> 00:11:50,054
My innovation. This way your car
will be waiting when you're finished.

159
00:11:59,188 --> 00:12:02,149
We agreed one large bowl for soufflé.

160
00:12:02,316 --> 00:12:04,526
This is crazy! This is my kitchen!

161
00:12:04,693 --> 00:12:07,446
lt's in my restaurant! One big bowl!

162
00:12:08,614 --> 00:12:13,577
Table 1 2 is still waiting. Don't
force me to send them free zucchini.

163
00:12:13,744 --> 00:12:16,788
- That's the ''in'' door.
- What did l hit?

164
00:12:16,955 --> 00:12:22,210
- What happened?
- Help me get him into the kitchen.

165
00:12:22,544 --> 00:12:25,213
That's the ''out'' door.

166
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:28,884
- No harm done.
- His nose is broken.

167
00:12:29,051 --> 00:12:32,262
- What shall we do?
- Start ladling out zucchini.

168
00:12:32,429 --> 00:12:36,433
- He's out cold!
- l'll take them to the emergency room.

169
00:12:40,645 --> 00:12:43,106
l'm trying to remain
a happy brother,

170
00:12:43,273 --> 00:12:47,861
but suddenly
we're without waiters or a bartender.

171
00:12:48,028 --> 00:12:50,655
First rule of the kitchen. Remain calm.

172
00:12:50,822 --> 00:12:55,660
- No, l told you individual cups, you oaf!
- l told him one large bowl!

173
00:12:55,827 --> 00:12:58,079
Are you out of your mind?

174
00:12:58,246 --> 00:13:01,166
Why not just serve it
in a baseball glove?

175
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:05,545
Ridiculous! How gauche!
l didn't know you had this streak!

176
00:13:05,712 --> 00:13:08,923
Maurice! No, wait!
Please let me finish!

177
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:12,594
- lt was an oversight.
- Now what?

178
00:13:12,761 --> 00:13:17,515
We make a battlefield promotion.
Congratulations. Our new head chef.

179
00:13:17,682 --> 00:13:21,895
- Thank you.
- We've a very important clientele.

180
00:13:22,061 --> 00:13:25,148
Two senators and
the head of the lmmigration Bureau.

181
00:13:26,024 --> 00:13:28,067
<i>Sacre bleu!</i>

182
00:13:38,786 --> 00:13:40,997
Any other names you'd like to drop?

183
00:13:42,081 --> 00:13:44,625
Fine, now we have no chef.

184
00:13:46,419 --> 00:13:49,714
No. No. Put the hat down.

185
00:13:49,881 --> 00:13:51,966
You are our new head chef.

186
00:13:52,133 --> 00:13:54,218
l can't cook all this food.

187
00:13:54,385 --> 00:13:59,348
Most of the meals are started.
Dad and Daphne can help us out.

188
00:13:59,515 --> 00:14:02,685
- Otto, cancel car 44.
- (Otto ) 'Who is this?'

189
00:14:03,728 --> 00:14:06,731
Dr Crane! lt's always Dr Crane!

190
00:14:10,401 --> 00:14:13,529
We need your help.
We've got a little disaster.

191
00:14:13,696 --> 00:14:15,573
Disaster?

192
00:14:17,616 --> 00:14:20,286
The staff walked out.

193
00:14:20,453 --> 00:14:23,247
l need you in the kitchen
and you behind the bar.

194
00:14:23,414 --> 00:14:25,458
You can gloat later.

195
00:14:25,624 --> 00:14:27,793
l'll pencil it in.

196
00:14:29,211 --> 00:14:32,548
lt's not the first time
l've washed up for me supper.

197
00:14:32,715 --> 00:14:34,842
Who'll wait on these tables?

198
00:14:35,009 --> 00:14:37,511
Oh, Frasier.

199
00:14:37,678 --> 00:14:39,513
Roz!

200
00:14:42,725 --> 00:14:46,228
l'm glad to see you, too. My date, Brad.

201
00:14:46,395 --> 00:14:49,023
- Pleasure.
- Pretty great, huh?

202
00:14:49,189 --> 00:14:54,278
- Have you got our special table?
- First, l want to discuss something.

203
00:14:54,445 --> 00:14:57,990
- lt's probably some surprise.
- Try to fool you!

204
00:14:58,157 --> 00:15:01,744
- What's your poison?
- l'll wait for Roz.

205
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:04,121
l'd have one now.

206
00:15:04,788 --> 00:15:06,832
Blackmailer!

207
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:10,711
Honey, l'm really sorry,

208
00:15:10,878 --> 00:15:13,380
but Frasier's waiters
had a terrible accident

209
00:15:13,547 --> 00:15:16,967
and he really needs my help.

210
00:15:17,134 --> 00:15:20,512
- l hope you'll try to understand.
- No problem.

211
00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:23,640
Could l get a menu
and some bread and butter?

212
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:30,856
You from around here?
How about those Supersonics?

213
00:15:33,567 --> 00:15:37,154
Niles is panicking.
l don't know if we can pull this off.

214
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,865
Just tell them what happened.

215
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:42,826
People are more understanding
than you think.

216
00:15:43,744 --> 00:15:46,663
Maybe honesty is the best policy.

217
00:15:48,707 --> 00:15:51,001
Everyone!

218
00:15:51,168 --> 00:15:56,715
Excuse me. Ladies and gentlemen,
l would just like to say...

219
00:15:56,882 --> 00:16:01,303
<i>- Good evening, Frasier.
- Bon appetit!</i>

220
00:16:01,469 --> 00:16:05,223
Gil, l thought you never reviewed
opening nights.

221
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:11,312
l made an exception and brought
an entire table of restaurant critics.

222
00:16:11,479 --> 00:16:15,233
Oh, well, that's...lovely.

223
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,652
l don't know if l can accommodate you.

224
00:16:17,819 --> 00:16:20,780
We'll take that one over there.

225
00:16:20,947 --> 00:16:25,743
<i>We're salivating to try anguilla.
l hear chef's a wizard with eels.</i>

226
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:30,415
Eels? That was his old speciality.

227
00:16:30,582 --> 00:16:32,750
You must try his new speciality.

228
00:16:32,917 --> 00:16:36,045
Scrambled eggs.

229
00:16:37,755 --> 00:16:39,507
Eels it is.

230
00:16:39,674 --> 00:16:43,594
Table four now want
Sole Veronique without grapes,

231
00:16:43,761 --> 00:16:47,015
spinach instead of broccoli,
risotto instead of pasta.

232
00:16:47,181 --> 00:16:52,520
- They also want...
- Just tell them, ''No substitutions''!

233
00:16:52,687 --> 00:16:56,232
- l have trouble saying no.
- So the guidebooks tell us.

234
00:16:57,525 --> 00:17:02,196
- Do you want to get thrown in the tank?
- You're not making this very easy.

235
00:17:02,363 --> 00:17:07,410
You waltz in here, la-di-da,
''extra broccoli, hold the capers,''

236
00:17:07,577 --> 00:17:09,704
then you go out on the fun side.

237
00:17:09,871 --> 00:17:12,790
You want to trade places?
Be my guest.

238
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,836
How dare you use that tone?

239
00:17:19,422 --> 00:17:21,549
All right, stop it!

240
00:17:22,717 --> 00:17:28,973
You're not being asked to do anything
you've never done in your own homes.

241
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:31,684
Now, quick, Niles, kill five eels!

242
00:17:31,851 --> 00:17:33,894
Wait!

243
00:17:36,647 --> 00:17:38,482
What?

244
00:17:38,649 --> 00:17:42,444
<i>Every restaurant critic in Seattle
wants anguilla. Kill eels!</i>

245
00:17:42,611 --> 00:17:45,197
How do you suggest l do that?

246
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:49,326
You're the chef!
Throw a toaster in the damn tank!

247
00:17:51,161 --> 00:17:54,123
Not to worry. Eels are on their way.

248
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:58,210
- Our mouths are watering.
- Our chef is in the process of...

249
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:07,594
frying them now.

250
00:18:07,761 --> 00:18:13,183
Excuse me, this is Veal Piccata.
l ordered Veal Marsala.

251
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:17,354
l'll rectify that at once.
l'll be right back.

252
00:18:17,521 --> 00:18:20,941
Niles, this Veal Piccata
has to be Veal Marsala.

253
00:18:30,659 --> 00:18:33,578
The mayor's table all want
Cherries Jubilee.

254
00:18:33,745 --> 00:18:37,082
Fine. You flame them.
How are those eels?

255
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:39,418
l'm just trimming them now.

256
00:18:39,584 --> 00:18:43,672
- Take them out of the tank!
- Not till l'm sure they're dead!

257
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:46,800
For heaven's sakes!

258
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:02,649
What was that?

259
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:07,445
Big blue flash. Cherries everywhere.

260
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,245
Lucky it didn't set off
the sprinkler system.

261
00:19:15,412 --> 00:19:20,959
We have a safety delay for this -
1 5 seconds before the sprinklers...

262
00:19:24,003 --> 00:19:26,339
kick in.

263
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:30,051
- Where do l turn it off?
- Over there.

264
00:19:30,218 --> 00:19:34,472
l hope you're satisfied!
You thinned my brown sauce.

265
00:19:36,683 --> 00:19:39,936
Good news! That was just a test!

266
00:19:41,938 --> 00:19:46,776
- l want my car! Now!
- Yes, ma'am, right away.

267
00:19:46,943 --> 00:19:49,821
Otto, bring car 23. Hurry!

268
00:19:49,988 --> 00:19:52,824
- (Otto ) 'Who is this?'
- lt's the voice of God!

269
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:55,952
Doc, great touch with the sprinklers!

270
00:19:56,119 --> 00:19:59,747
My date's dress is clinging to her
like saran wrap!

271
00:19:59,914 --> 00:20:06,003
Every restaurant has to adjust.
You'll remember this as an adventure!

272
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:09,298
And if they don't remember it,
l'll remind them.

273
00:20:11,467 --> 00:20:16,055
Please keep us in mind
for your next special occasion.

274
00:20:16,222 --> 00:20:19,767
We plan exciting innovations
in the weeks to come.

275
00:20:26,107 --> 00:20:30,277
Starting with...
our drive-through window.

276
00:20:33,572 --> 00:20:35,825
Number 23 is ready.

277
00:20:49,964 --> 00:20:54,802
How much firepower is necessary
to embed a cherry in a ceiling tile?

278
00:20:56,929 --> 00:20:59,390
Another question we should have asked

279
00:20:59,556 --> 00:21:03,352
before entering
the exciting world of food service.

280
00:21:04,311 --> 00:21:07,856
Those eels are starting to stink!

281
00:21:09,566 --> 00:21:14,279
Dad, you've circled like a shark.
Just give us your speech.

282
00:21:14,446 --> 00:21:19,326
You guys will punish yourselves
enough without me chiming in.

283
00:21:20,494 --> 00:21:23,163
- Thanks.
- Hey, l'm your dad.

284
00:21:26,667 --> 00:21:29,294
Hello, Happy Brothers Restaurant.

285
00:21:30,212 --> 00:21:35,384
Table for two? No problem. Smoke
damaged or non-smoke damaged?

286
00:21:39,972 --> 00:21:45,310
You know, we could tell people
he died in the explosion.

287
00:21:53,819 --> 00:21:58,907
# Hey baby, l hear the blues are calling
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

288
00:21:59,074 --> 00:22:00,784
# Mercy!

289
00:22:00,951 --> 00:22:07,749
# And maybe l seem a bit confused
Yeah, maybe, but l got you pegged

290
00:22:07,916 --> 00:22:14,673
# But l don't know what to do with those
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

291
00:22:14,839 --> 00:22:16,925
# They're calling again #

292
00:22:17,092 --> 00:22:20,220
# Scrambled egg's all over my face!

293
00:22:20,387 --> 00:22:24,224
# What is a boy to do? #

294
00:22:24,391 --> 00:22:27,894
Good night everybody!
