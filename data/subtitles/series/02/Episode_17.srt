1
00:00:08,634 --> 00:00:12,763
Caroline, if you've had therapy
for two years without much progress,

2
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:15,474
perhaps you've reached a plateau,

3
00:00:15,641 --> 00:00:17,684
or you and your therapist have done

4
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:19,811
all you can together.

5
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:24,024
(Caroline ) 'Maybe you're right.
He's kind of dry and long-winded.'

6
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:29,780
That's a long time to spend with a
psychiatrist who's dry and long-winded.

7
00:00:29,946 --> 00:00:32,324
Amen to that.

8
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:35,994
'Thanks, Dr Crane.
l'll think about that.

9
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:39,581
'Would it be OK if l called back
and picked your brain?'

10
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:42,417
Just consider me your mental banjo.

11
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:45,921
That's it for this fine Friday.

12
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:50,091
This is Frasier Crane
saying we'll see you next week.

13
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:52,927
Good show, Frasier.

14
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:56,389
l've waited for this moment
for an entire week.

15
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:05,732
That's what l love about you.
You work hard and play hard.

16
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:08,985
l'm looking forward to this weekend.

17
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:15,074
Even conscientious psychiatrists
can have their fill of people's problems.

18
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:17,660
Hi. ls one of you Roz Doyle?

19
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:21,039
Yes. That's all the clues you're getting.

20
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:28,880
A little offering
from one of your suitors, perhaps?

21
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:33,426
A nice string of pearls,
a teardrop pendant...

22
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:36,721
lt's a brick of cheese!

23
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:42,727
On the right chain it should look smart.

24
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:47,648
lt's from my family. They're at
my uncle's dairy farm in Wisconsin.

25
00:01:47,815 --> 00:01:51,736
- Why didn't you go?
- There wasn't time. Now l wish l had.

26
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:56,407
We have such fun.
Once there was this cheese platter

27
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:58,618
and my uncle spoke in cheese.

28
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:03,205
lnstead of saying, ''Hello. How are
you?'' He said, ''Hello, Havarti?''

29
00:02:05,916 --> 00:02:08,502
Someone else would go, ''l'm Gouda.''

30
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,089
What would come after that?

31
00:02:12,256 --> 00:02:15,259
lf l'd been there,
the sound of a gunshot.

32
00:02:16,635 --> 00:02:19,221
(Sobbing) Don't make fun.
l miss those people.

33
00:02:21,932 --> 00:02:23,767
There, there.

34
00:02:23,934 --> 00:02:26,687
- We play games and sing songs.
- l know.

35
00:02:26,854 --> 00:02:30,065
And Aunt Libby
does cannonballs into the lake.

36
00:02:30,232 --> 00:02:32,276
The memories must be...

37
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:37,448
And Uncle Ned has too much to drink
and puts pants on all the cows.

38
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:43,537
lf you want family fun tonight, why
don't you come to my dad's birthday?

39
00:02:43,704 --> 00:02:46,165
l forgot about it last year.

40
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:49,293
There's just one rule -
no work, just a good time.

41
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:53,088
- l wouldn't be much fun.
- l insist.

42
00:02:53,255 --> 00:02:58,010
l enjoy partying with you
and l hate to see you like this.

43
00:02:58,177 --> 00:03:00,804
l Camembert it.

44
00:03:02,264 --> 00:03:03,807
How sweet.

45
00:03:10,564 --> 00:03:14,901
All right! lt's someone's birthday.

46
00:03:15,068 --> 00:03:18,989
l hope you're in the mood for a party.
l know l am.

47
00:03:19,156 --> 00:03:21,867
- You're bloody impossible!
- You're a bloody nag!

48
00:03:22,034 --> 00:03:24,119
Don't shake that cane at me!

49
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,165
For heaven's sake, not again.

50
00:03:28,331 --> 00:03:31,668
l know what l want for my birthday.
Fire Daphne.

51
00:03:31,835 --> 00:03:34,504
You'd have to rehire me first. l quit.

52
00:03:34,671 --> 00:03:38,925
l hope l never see that hateful old
canker sore ever again.

53
00:03:39,092 --> 00:03:41,887
- What is it this time?
- The usual.

54
00:03:42,053 --> 00:03:46,224
l ask him to exercise
and he twists his face up like a baby.

55
00:03:46,391 --> 00:03:52,856
You asked by pouring my beer away
and banging a pot with a spoon.

56
00:03:53,023 --> 00:03:56,026
- l don't have to be your friend.
- Good.

57
00:03:56,192 --> 00:03:58,987
l got a friend here
who isn't a yammering nag.

58
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:03,575
- Eddie, fetch!
- Stop this!

59
00:04:03,742 --> 00:04:08,663
Pick your argument up tomorrow.
Tonight we're having a party.

60
00:04:10,915 --> 00:04:15,462
l went to Emilio's. l got some
lemon cake, snacks, and champagne.

61
00:04:15,628 --> 00:04:18,047
Can we agree to have fun this evening?

62
00:04:18,214 --> 00:04:19,591
(Doorbell)

63
00:04:19,757 --> 00:04:24,596
That'll be Roz. She's down
and in need of a happy environment.

64
00:04:24,762 --> 00:04:29,142
l could use the same thing.
Can you just agree to a truce?

65
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:31,644
(Both mutter)

66
00:04:33,813 --> 00:04:36,190
- Roz, hello!
- Hi, Frasier.

67
00:04:36,357 --> 00:04:39,235
Hey, Martin. Happy birthday.

68
00:04:39,402 --> 00:04:41,863
You didn't have to do this!

69
00:04:43,322 --> 00:04:45,825
Thanks. l'll model it for you later.

70
00:04:45,992 --> 00:04:48,369
He's already modelling one.

71
00:04:48,536 --> 00:04:50,246
(Doorbell)

72
00:04:50,413 --> 00:04:54,333
l have a nice evening planned.
Can we try to be civil?

73
00:04:55,293 --> 00:04:58,129
You unprincipled charlatan!

74
00:04:58,296 --> 00:05:01,299
You unconscionable fraud!

75
00:05:01,465 --> 00:05:03,467
- Happy birthday, Dad.
- Thanks.

76
00:05:03,634 --> 00:05:05,886
What are you talking about?

77
00:05:06,053 --> 00:05:08,723
You spoke to a patient of mine today.
Caroline.

78
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:14,395
Due to your fast-food approach
to psychiatry, she left me.

79
00:05:16,188 --> 00:05:18,607
Caroline was your patient? l...

80
00:05:19,442 --> 00:05:25,239
Two years of my hard work wiped out
by your two-minute McSession.

81
00:05:27,825 --> 00:05:31,453
l merely suggested
she consider a change.

82
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:34,874
Based on what diagnostic method?
One potato, two potato?

83
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:39,712
Fancy that. A member of this family
not taking the time to do something.

84
00:05:39,878 --> 00:05:43,882
- Quack!
- Exactly, Dad. Quack!

85
00:05:44,049 --> 00:05:47,261
- l was talking to her.
- Don't you raise your cane at her.

86
00:05:55,686 --> 00:05:58,897
Wait! Roz, where are you going?

87
00:06:01,608 --> 00:06:05,737
- l think l'd better leave.
- We were just talking.

88
00:06:05,904 --> 00:06:11,743
l'd just rather be by myself.
Thanks, guys. l had a wonderful time.

89
00:06:13,996 --> 00:06:17,916
- You've ruined her evening.
- Her evening? lt's my birthday.

90
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:22,713
Let's get that underway.
Who's ready for cake?

91
00:06:23,964 --> 00:06:28,593
l don't want to keep you all here,
so let's get this over with.

92
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,263
Thanks for a great party!

93
00:06:33,223 --> 00:06:36,101
(Niles) There's nothing wrong
with Dad's lungs.

94
00:06:38,687 --> 00:06:42,440
(Daphne ) Every light in the city is out.
lt must be a blackout.

95
00:06:42,607 --> 00:06:46,695
(Frasier) There's worse places to be.
(Niles) Like the elevator... Roz!

96
00:06:46,862 --> 00:06:48,947
(Martin) Why couldn't it be Daphne?

97
00:06:49,114 --> 00:06:53,243
(Martin yells after a crash)
Stop doing that!

98
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:00,625
(Daphne ) We need to get some light.
(Martin) Eddie, where are you?

99
00:07:00,792 --> 00:07:03,920
(Daphne ) Excuse me, Dr Crane.
(Niles) Quite all right, Daphne.

100
00:07:04,087 --> 00:07:07,882
(Frasier) Where are the lamps?
(Daphne ) They're in the kitchen.

101
00:07:08,049 --> 00:07:11,428
(Frasier) Dad, light a fire.
(Daphne ) Excuse me, Dr Crane.

102
00:07:11,594 --> 00:07:13,721
(Niles) Not your fault, Daphne.

103
00:07:14,806 --> 00:07:16,850
(Martin) Where are you, Eddie?

104
00:07:17,016 --> 00:07:18,476
(Eddie growls)

105
00:07:18,643 --> 00:07:20,895
(Frasier) l've found him!

106
00:07:21,062 --> 00:07:23,356
(Daphne ) That's better.

107
00:07:23,523 --> 00:07:26,025
l'll get my radio. See what's going on.

108
00:07:27,902 --> 00:07:30,238
Roz, are you all right?

109
00:07:30,405 --> 00:07:35,243
l'm fine. The blackout hit as the elevator
opened on the 1 4th floor.

110
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:40,415
l stood there trying to decide
whether to come back up here,

111
00:07:40,581 --> 00:07:44,794
or take my chances in the streets
with the muggers and the weirdos.

112
00:07:46,129 --> 00:07:48,589
So l went down a couple of flights...

113
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:52,593
then l changed my mind.

114
00:07:53,553 --> 00:07:56,013
Somebody's probably
looting my apartment.

115
00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:00,810
There's a thriving black market
in badly designed Formica tables.

116
00:08:02,061 --> 00:08:04,522
At least l have my own sense of style.

117
00:08:04,689 --> 00:08:10,278
You won't buy a chair unless a fey
French aristocrat sat his fat fanny in it.

118
00:08:10,444 --> 00:08:14,073
Louis XlV was not fey.
Everyone wore garters then.

119
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,410
- lf they were fey they did.
- He was a big man.

120
00:08:17,576 --> 00:08:20,121
(French accent) Silence, enfants!

121
00:08:22,081 --> 00:08:26,961
We can all sit in the dark and be
miserable or we can try having fun.

122
00:08:27,128 --> 00:08:30,548
- l'll call Maris.
- Niles has voted. Who votes for fun?

123
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:34,343
l'm going to go get a glass of wine.

124
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:38,597
The steaks we were having are out.
l'll see what l can find.

125
00:08:39,473 --> 00:08:42,476
- Sorry, Dr Crane.
- Excuse me, Daphne.

126
00:08:42,643 --> 00:08:45,729
Power's out all over Seattle.
They're working on it.

127
00:08:45,896 --> 00:08:51,193
Thank God l got you. Don't panic.
lt's important to stay calm.

128
00:08:52,569 --> 00:08:54,613
About the blackout.

129
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:57,241
Maris, take off your slumber mask.

130
00:08:59,326 --> 00:09:03,747
No, darling, don't panic. Honey.
No, honey, we're... Honey.

131
00:09:07,376 --> 00:09:09,837
She's fine.

132
00:09:14,758 --> 00:09:16,844
Yum scrum, pig's bum.

133
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:21,431
Here's something nice -
half-gallon tubs of vanilla fudge.

134
00:09:22,432 --> 00:09:26,228
Let's have these right away
before they melt.

135
00:09:26,395 --> 00:09:28,397
They'll stay cold for at least 24 hours.

136
00:09:28,563 --> 00:09:30,315
Shut up!

137
00:09:31,525 --> 00:09:36,571
l don't like to be nostalgic, but it
was great when you forgot my birthday.

138
00:09:39,699 --> 00:09:42,953
What we need to do
is liven things up a little bit.

139
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,373
A game. What was it we played
at the Vanderkelins

140
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:50,502
while they costumed the servants
for the living chess match?

141
00:09:51,586 --> 00:09:54,840
l remember!
lt was ''l'm the dullest person''.

142
00:09:55,006 --> 00:09:58,009
Pick a game someone else
has a chance of winning.

143
00:10:01,137 --> 00:10:04,975
That's got things shaking.
Come on, Dad. Come on.

144
00:10:05,141 --> 00:10:07,602
The object is, we all get pennies

145
00:10:07,769 --> 00:10:10,563
and we try to get
the other person's pennies.

146
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:12,816
Please, slow down!

147
00:10:13,983 --> 00:10:17,445
All right, if l were going to go
l would say,

148
00:10:17,612 --> 00:10:22,534
''l am the dullest because
l've never been on a roller coaster''.

149
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:27,080
Everyone who has been on
a roller coaster would give me a penny.

150
00:10:27,247 --> 00:10:29,707
Now, we all have our pennies.

151
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:35,171
- Will you go first, Daphne?
- l can't think of anything.

152
00:10:35,338 --> 00:10:39,884
Say whatever comes to mind.
''l'm the dullest person because... ''

153
00:10:40,051 --> 00:10:44,764
Because l've never made love
in a lift or a phone booth

154
00:10:44,931 --> 00:10:48,267
or on an airplane or a merry-go-round.

155
00:10:48,434 --> 00:10:52,730
That's good, but it should be something
someone might have...

156
00:10:54,816 --> 00:10:56,901
done.

157
00:11:09,789 --> 00:11:13,125
l was in college.
l was trying to find myself.

158
00:11:14,126 --> 00:11:17,463
You just needed
to look under the nearest man.

159
00:11:20,049 --> 00:11:22,593
All right, Dad, get our pennies.

160
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:27,223
l'm the dullest person
because l've never been to France.

161
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:31,560
That's the spirit.
Niles? Something you've never done.

162
00:11:31,727 --> 00:11:35,815
l'm dull because l've never
sabotaged my brother's career.

163
00:11:35,981 --> 00:11:39,860
- Give it a rest!
- Your father could show you how.

164
00:11:41,195 --> 00:11:43,239
(Arguing)

165
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:50,246
Will you stop? You are torturing
me! l could report you to Amnesty!

166
00:11:51,872 --> 00:11:55,501
- l'm out of here.
- Where are you going?

167
00:11:55,668 --> 00:12:00,673
To sit in the tub with a hair dryer
waiting for the power to come back on (!)

168
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:05,719
This blackout could go on all night.
l'll brave the streets and get back.

169
00:12:05,886 --> 00:12:08,889
l hope it isn't like that storm.

170
00:12:09,056 --> 00:12:14,311
l had to coax Maris from under the bed
by tying a Prozac to some string.

171
00:12:20,484 --> 00:12:23,987
- You want to have a little cake?
- No, thanks.

172
00:12:25,489 --> 00:12:29,910
This reminds me of Wisconsin -
all dark and deserted.

173
00:12:30,077 --> 00:12:32,829
lsn't that on the licence plate?

174
00:12:34,873 --> 00:12:38,335
What's the real reason
you didn't go? You've made it before.

175
00:12:39,836 --> 00:12:42,255
Well... No.

176
00:12:42,422 --> 00:12:46,385
You don't want to hear any more
problems and l don't blame you.

177
00:12:46,551 --> 00:12:51,181
l think we have time
for one more caller.

178
00:12:53,892 --> 00:12:59,689
Well, every year l go to my reunion
and my relatives crowd around me

179
00:12:59,856 --> 00:13:02,359
and l answer the same questions.

180
00:13:02,526 --> 00:13:06,112
''No, l'm not married.''
''No, l don't have kids.''

181
00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:09,866
''Yes, l still have that tattoo.
No, you can't see it.''

182
00:13:12,494 --> 00:13:16,206
lt'd be nice if l could at least say,
''l have a great career.''

183
00:13:16,373 --> 00:13:18,833
You do have a great career.

184
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,797
Tell them that. They say l spend
four hours on the phone every day

185
00:13:23,963 --> 00:13:26,299
with a bunch of losers and whackos

186
00:13:26,466 --> 00:13:31,471
and then some tedious know-it-all
gives them pointless advice.

187
00:13:35,225 --> 00:13:38,561
That's not me talking.
That's my Uncle Ned.

188
00:13:38,728 --> 00:13:40,980
The cow haberdasher.

189
00:13:43,066 --> 00:13:47,445
Roz, ten years ago,
KACL didn't have any women producers.

190
00:13:48,613 --> 00:13:53,326
You're a pioneer. You've won awards.
You help people.

191
00:13:55,161 --> 00:13:57,246
Sounds right when you say it.

192
00:13:57,413 --> 00:14:02,043
There's more than your job. You should
explore other areas of your life -

193
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:05,505
interests,
or maybe a serious relationship.

194
00:14:06,714 --> 00:14:08,841
Maybe you're right.

195
00:14:09,008 --> 00:14:13,763
How long can l chase 25-year-olds
that are all looks and no substance?

196
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:18,351
- Exactly, Roz.
- l'm asking. Three, four years?

197
00:14:18,976 --> 00:14:20,811
(Crash)

198
00:14:20,978 --> 00:14:25,024
- (Daphne ) Oh, bloody hell!
- Daphne, are you all right?

199
00:14:25,191 --> 00:14:28,694
l broke Martin's souvenir spoon rest
from Atlantic City.

200
00:14:28,861 --> 00:14:31,405
Oh, good.

201
00:14:31,572 --> 00:14:36,744
When l have my own kitchen l'll put
my spoons right on the damn counter.

202
00:14:36,911 --> 00:14:41,749
l've always said,
when l save $2,000 l'll get a place.

203
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:44,502
- How much have you saved?
- 4,000.

204
00:14:44,668 --> 00:14:50,132
l know what you're thinking.
What's wrong with me? Why do l stay?

205
00:14:50,299 --> 00:14:53,093
l was thinking l'm overpaying you.

206
00:14:55,387 --> 00:15:00,142
My friends say, ''You should be on
your own, have a place, have a life.''

207
00:15:01,143 --> 00:15:03,687
Why do l stay here?

208
00:15:03,854 --> 00:15:07,650
Could it be that maybe you...
you like us?

209
00:15:09,151 --> 00:15:14,364
My grandmother had a cat, a mangy
old thing, kept ruining the furniture.

210
00:15:14,531 --> 00:15:16,742
l asked her why she kept it

211
00:15:16,909 --> 00:15:23,373
and she said she liked having
another heartbeat in the house.

212
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:27,753
lt just makes me feel
like l'm unambitious.

213
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,381
l could work in a hospital or a clinic.

214
00:15:31,548 --> 00:15:35,135
Maybe that's not
what's important to you right now.

215
00:15:35,302 --> 00:15:38,972
You like being part of a family.
What's wrong with that?

216
00:15:40,223 --> 00:15:42,559
Nothing, l suppose.

217
00:15:42,726 --> 00:15:47,606
Although my friends wonder how
l can live with such demanding men.

218
00:15:47,773 --> 00:15:52,069
- They call me demanding?
- No, they call you a pompous ass.

219
00:15:54,738 --> 00:15:59,493
- But you've learned that l'm not.
- No, l've learned to work around it.

220
00:16:00,202 --> 00:16:02,245
l'm getting a beer.

221
00:16:02,412 --> 00:16:08,335
l know it's bad for me, will make me
fat, and keep me from exercising.

222
00:16:08,501 --> 00:16:13,506
- You have anything to add to that?
- Yes. Happy birthday, you old sod.

223
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,222
They try to confuse you on purpose.

224
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:32,233
Room temperature. Just like England -
another place l'll never get to.

225
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,862
You mentioned going to Europe
when your hip improved.

226
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:39,157
Now you say you'll never get there.
What's changed?

227
00:16:39,324 --> 00:16:41,618
My hip's the same as then.

228
00:16:41,784 --> 00:16:46,664
l thought l'd be better
but l'm not and probably never will be.

229
00:16:46,831 --> 00:16:53,171
You're happy just sitting on your can,
doing your show, living in your head.

230
00:16:53,338 --> 00:16:56,132
l'm used to being out there.

231
00:16:57,675 --> 00:16:59,427
Eddie!

232
00:17:07,643 --> 00:17:09,854
Listen, Dad,

233
00:17:10,021 --> 00:17:12,190
you can still travel.

234
00:17:12,356 --> 00:17:17,195
No, you can. lf you can't
walk around Paris, you could...

235
00:17:17,361 --> 00:17:22,491
sit at a nice café
and let Paris walk past you.

236
00:17:22,658 --> 00:17:26,245
Maybe buy a drink
for a beautiful mademoiselle.

237
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:28,706
Get a nice bottle of imported beer.

238
00:17:28,873 --> 00:17:34,128
- l only like Ballantine's.
- ln Paris, Ballantine's is imported.

239
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:39,717
<i>And you are the
handsome Américain...</i>

240
00:17:39,884 --> 00:17:42,303
with the adorable accent.

241
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:48,726
They like moustaches, don't they?

242
00:17:55,566 --> 00:18:00,446
(Breathless) 1 9 floors down to my car.
Garage door's electric. Can't open.

243
00:18:00,613 --> 00:18:03,115
20 floors back up. Lost count.

244
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:07,286
Bad lady upstairs. Big dog.
Need place to die.

245
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:13,417
- (Roz) Same to you, buddy!
- Who are you talking to?

246
00:18:13,584 --> 00:18:17,880
Some rowdy guys downstairs.
Come on, l want you to introduce us.

247
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:23,552
- Keep your pants on.
- Let me take your coat.

248
00:18:24,845 --> 00:18:29,183
- Haven't you taken enough from me?
- You're being irrational.

249
00:18:29,349 --> 00:18:32,144
- Sticks and stones.
- You're acting like Dad.

250
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:34,855
You take that back!

251
00:18:37,774 --> 00:18:41,862
You're not really mad at me.
l didn't tell her to leave you.

252
00:18:42,029 --> 00:18:46,116
l merely suggested it as an option.
lt was her choice.

253
00:18:46,283 --> 00:18:50,037
Could it be you're upset
because you couldn't help her?

254
00:18:50,203 --> 00:18:54,583
l hate it when you take a criticism
and turn it back on me.

255
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:59,129
- l think l'm right.
- You are. That's why l hate it.

256
00:19:01,465 --> 00:19:05,886
Do you know what l went through
trying to help her?

257
00:19:06,052 --> 00:19:08,305
Yes, l think l do.

258
00:19:08,471 --> 00:19:12,225
Niles, you're a perfectionist.

259
00:19:14,102 --> 00:19:16,605
As faults go,
that's not such a bad one.

260
00:19:16,771 --> 00:19:21,943
Just would've been nice if l'd been
the one to say it was time to go.

261
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:26,990
lnstead, she heard it from a glib,
albeit insightful, radio pundit.

262
00:19:29,534 --> 00:19:32,579
Those guys
invited us to a blackout party.

263
00:19:32,746 --> 00:19:35,457
- They got cold beer.
- And Jarlsberg.

264
00:19:35,623 --> 00:19:39,711
l was feeling a bit down,
but suddenly l'm in a party mood.

265
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:43,798
- What about our party?
- There are people downstairs.

266
00:19:43,965 --> 00:19:47,886
- Come on, Frasier.
- No, thank you. l'm not in the mood.

267
00:19:48,052 --> 00:19:53,057
- Don't be a party-pooper.
- Let him be. He was always that way.

268
00:19:53,224 --> 00:19:58,479
Maybe it's time for a lesson about
living the life of this party-pooper.

269
00:19:58,646 --> 00:20:02,400
l spend the whole week
ministering to the troubled,

270
00:20:02,567 --> 00:20:05,653
the neurotic
and the sometimes plain goofy.

271
00:20:06,571 --> 00:20:09,991
Then l hang up my earphones
and it doesn't end there.

272
00:20:10,158 --> 00:20:13,745
On the street, at the café,
even in this building...

273
00:20:13,911 --> 00:20:16,497
more people come up for help.

274
00:20:16,664 --> 00:20:19,625
They think it's OK. lt's what l do.

275
00:20:19,792 --> 00:20:24,672
But every time l help them
it costs me a piece of myself.

276
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:27,633
A little here, a little there...

277
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:33,222
Till l feel like a zebra carcass on
the Serengeti surrounded by vultures.

278
00:20:35,641 --> 00:20:38,144
This was one of those weeks.

279
00:20:39,228 --> 00:20:43,816
l had my escape planned. l was coming
for an evening of fun with my family.

280
00:20:43,983 --> 00:20:49,530
But l get you four going at each
other like the Borgias on a bad day.

281
00:20:51,657 --> 00:20:53,701
So l roll up my sleeves,

282
00:20:53,868 --> 00:20:58,038
tending to each one of you,
and you all feel better.

283
00:20:58,205 --> 00:21:01,917
The minute you get the whiff
of mesquite from down below...

284
00:21:03,294 --> 00:21:07,756
you are out the door
without so much as a ''thank you''.

285
00:21:08,632 --> 00:21:13,554
Well, thank you for the invitation,
but l'm fed up with people's problems.

286
00:21:13,721 --> 00:21:16,140
The doctor is out.

287
00:21:16,307 --> 00:21:18,434
Oh, come on.

288
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,979
- Apologies accepted.
- Great! So you'll come?

289
00:21:23,689 --> 00:21:25,190
No, no...

290
00:21:25,357 --> 00:21:28,026
l love you all. l really do.

291
00:21:28,193 --> 00:21:32,573
But l want to be alone, here,
where no one needs anything from me.

292
00:21:32,739 --> 00:21:37,077
- Well, all right.
- l'll bring you some barbecue.

293
00:21:38,662 --> 00:21:40,706
Oh, my God. lt's dark out here.

294
00:21:52,092 --> 00:21:54,594
Oh, for God's sake.

295
00:21:54,761 --> 00:21:57,347
No, l'm not going to do it.

296
00:22:13,738 --> 00:22:16,074
# Hey baby, l hear the blues are calling

297
00:22:16,241 --> 00:22:19,327
# Tossed salads and scrambled eggs

298
00:22:19,494 --> 00:22:20,745
