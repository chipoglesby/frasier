1
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,927
You're on KACL
with Dr Frasier Crane.

2
00:00:12,094 --> 00:00:14,472
We have time for one more call.

3
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,891
Hello, Gretchen. l'm listening.

4
00:00:17,058 --> 00:00:21,645
(Gretchen) 'Well, you see, Dr Crane,
my husband is a fencing instructor

5
00:00:21,812 --> 00:00:26,192
'and lately he spends all his time
with his wealthy new student

6
00:00:26,358 --> 00:00:30,029
<i>'and l'm afraid
there's some bumsen going on.'</i>

7
00:00:31,947 --> 00:00:38,078
- Do you have any evidence?
- 'No, it's just a feeling.'

8
00:00:38,245 --> 00:00:42,416
Well, in these matters, there's
no simple way to know for sure.

9
00:00:42,583 --> 00:00:44,627
Yes, there is.

10
00:00:45,878 --> 00:00:47,963
Well, Gretchen, you're in luck.

11
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:50,799
lt just so happens
we have in our studio today

12
00:00:50,966 --> 00:00:54,428
<i>one of the world's
five leading bumsen experts.</i>

13
00:00:55,596 --> 00:01:00,642
lf you want to know if a man is cheating,
you offer him two choices for dinner,

14
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:03,520
one that's fattening and one that's light.

15
00:01:03,687 --> 00:01:05,731
lf he picks the calorie packed one,

16
00:01:05,898 --> 00:01:07,941
he doesn't mind turning into a pig,

17
00:01:08,108 --> 00:01:10,861
which means he's happily married.

18
00:01:11,028 --> 00:01:14,072
Hearing advice like that,
l wish there was a law against

19
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:16,617
women gathering at a water cooler.

20
00:01:18,243 --> 00:01:21,371
- Now, Gretchen...
- 'Does it really work, Roz?'

21
00:01:21,538 --> 00:01:24,833
- Oh, trust me.
- 'l'm going to do it.

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,127
'Thank you for your help, Roz.

23
00:01:27,294 --> 00:01:31,757
- 'Oh, and you too, Dr Crane.'
- Don't mention it.

24
00:01:31,923 --> 00:01:36,428
Well, Dr Crane
and friends will be back tomorrow.

25
00:01:36,595 --> 00:01:38,722
Thanks for listening, Seattle.

26
00:01:41,099 --> 00:01:45,145
- l know you hate it when l butt in.
- And yet...

27
00:01:45,312 --> 00:01:49,024
You'll forgive me when you find out
what l'm doing for you.

28
00:01:49,191 --> 00:01:52,027
There's this woman
who lives in my building.

29
00:01:52,194 --> 00:01:56,615
- She's beautiful and funny.
- Stop. l do not go out on blind dates.

30
00:01:56,781 --> 00:01:59,034
They're demeaning and a waste of time.

31
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,454
- No, thank you. No.
- lt's for your father.

32
00:02:02,621 --> 00:02:04,789
What time should he pick her up?

33
00:02:04,956 --> 00:02:08,752
Wait a minute. They are OK
for your father, but not for you?

34
00:02:08,918 --> 00:02:13,757
Yes. And games with balls, beer and
giant trucks that roll over small ones.

35
00:02:17,135 --> 00:02:20,013
''So you want to build
a three-masted schooner.

36
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:23,141
''Before assembly,
take inventory of all parts.''

37
00:02:23,308 --> 00:02:25,685
- We don't need to read that.
- We do.

38
00:02:25,852 --> 00:02:28,980
lt says here, in bold,
''Read all instructions''.

39
00:02:29,147 --> 00:02:31,357
Pass me the right side of the hull.

40
00:02:31,524 --> 00:02:35,445
You'll get that piece at Step 1 6
and not a moment sooner.

41
00:02:35,612 --> 00:02:39,198
- Can we get started here?
- All right, Dad.

42
00:02:40,283 --> 00:02:43,328
''So you want to build
a three-masted schooner.''

43
00:02:43,494 --> 00:02:47,248
Give me that! You'll put your eye out.

44
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:52,879
Look at that! What a beautiful ship!

45
00:02:53,046 --> 00:02:57,216
- l bet you'll have fun building that.
- Not as much fun as reading about it.

46
00:02:57,383 --> 00:03:01,888
Did l ever mention one of my ancestors
was a mutineer on HMS Bounty.

47
00:03:02,054 --> 00:03:03,514
(Martin) No kidding.

48
00:03:03,681 --> 00:03:08,686
He made it safely to Pitcairn lsland
where he was fruitful and multiplied.

49
00:03:08,853 --> 00:03:12,648
For all l know, there's some girl
who looks exactly like me

50
00:03:12,815 --> 00:03:15,568
in the South Seas,
frolicking in the surf,

51
00:03:15,735 --> 00:03:18,112
brown-skinned and bare breasted.

52
00:03:24,535 --> 00:03:27,621
So you want to build
a two-masted schooner?

53
00:03:28,497 --> 00:03:30,875
Schooner? l thought it was a frigate.

54
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:33,294
A frigate has a fore-and-aft mainsail.

55
00:03:33,461 --> 00:03:36,630
- That's a brigantine.
- Well, what's a frigate?

56
00:03:36,797 --> 00:03:39,758
That's when you just don't give a damn.

57
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:46,807
- Hello.
- Hello there.

58
00:03:46,974 --> 00:03:49,018
Are you spending
the evening with us?

59
00:03:49,184 --> 00:03:52,271
Yes. Maris misses me,
but feels family comes first.

60
00:03:52,438 --> 00:03:55,774
She saw this model
and felt l should share it with Dad.

61
00:03:55,941 --> 00:03:59,403
- She wanted you out of the house?
- Like a musty smell.

62
00:04:01,113 --> 00:04:03,741
Dad, l have a proposal for you.

63
00:04:03,907 --> 00:04:08,495
There's a woman in Roz's building
that would like to go out with you.

64
00:04:08,662 --> 00:04:11,331
Roz says she's got
a wonderful personality.

65
00:04:11,498 --> 00:04:14,293
Oh, l guess that means
l'm the pretty one.

66
00:04:17,796 --> 00:04:21,550
- Tell Roz thanks but no thanks.
- You're making a mistake.

67
00:04:21,717 --> 00:04:25,596
Trying new things is what keeps us
all young and vibrant.

68
00:04:25,762 --> 00:04:30,225
You're right. For weeks Maris floated
in a sensory deprivation tank,

69
00:04:30,392 --> 00:04:34,479
but she's taken up fencing
and l've never seen her more vital.

70
00:04:36,857 --> 00:04:41,486
She stays up late into the evening,
working with her instructor.

71
00:04:42,571 --> 00:04:45,782
- Maris has a fencing instructor?
- Yes.

72
00:04:45,949 --> 00:04:49,536
Gunnar was the Bavarian champion
three years running.

73
00:04:49,703 --> 00:04:52,622
He's Bavarian?

74
00:04:53,123 --> 00:04:56,376
You're full of questions
l've already answered.

75
00:04:56,543 --> 00:04:58,587
Am l?

76
00:05:01,298 --> 00:05:06,219
He speaks no English. Maris practises
German while she parries and thrusts.

77
00:05:07,971 --> 00:05:10,056
Maris is learning German, huh?

78
00:05:10,223 --> 00:05:13,601
Just when you thought
she couldn't get any cuddlier.

79
00:05:16,312 --> 00:05:20,650
- Dad, did you take the spanking aft?
- Yeah, l pre-glued it for you.

80
00:05:20,817 --> 00:05:23,319
- Good job!
- Not to worry.

81
00:05:23,486 --> 00:05:26,239
This used to happen
to my brothers all the time.

82
00:05:26,406 --> 00:05:29,784
l can get it off with nail polish remover.
Come with me.

83
00:05:29,951 --> 00:05:34,622
- So your brothers built models?
- No, l suspect they just sniffed glue.

84
00:05:35,707 --> 00:05:39,961
- That can cause brain damage.
- Well, then, that confirms it.

85
00:05:40,128 --> 00:05:43,548
Dad. Dad.
l have to talk to you about Niles.

86
00:05:43,715 --> 00:05:47,844
l got a call from a German woman
whose husband is a fencing instructor

87
00:05:48,011 --> 00:05:52,515
that she suspects is having
an affair with his wealthy new client.

88
00:05:53,391 --> 00:05:57,145
- And?
- Don't you find it incriminating?

89
00:05:57,311 --> 00:06:00,022
lt's a coincidence. Seattle's a big city.

90
00:06:00,189 --> 00:06:03,943
l'm sure German fencing instructors
have dozens of students.

91
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:05,903
But are they wealthy?

92
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:10,575
No. They're working their way out
of the ghetto with a foil and a dream (!)

93
00:06:12,535 --> 00:06:15,413
ln the midst
of that slag heap of sarcasm,

94
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,623
there may be a kernel of truth.

95
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:21,043
l could be letting my imagination
run away with me.

96
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:24,130
Forget it.
Help me put this model together.

97
00:06:24,297 --> 00:06:28,175
Oh, my God. l remember how
Niles used to love these models.

98
00:06:28,342 --> 00:06:32,680
Remember that Christmas Mum got him
''The Visible Man And Woman''?

99
00:06:32,847 --> 00:06:36,851
- He had to glue the internal organs.
- l remember you two fighting.

100
00:06:37,017 --> 00:06:39,937
He got on my nerves,
so l stole his ovaries.

101
00:06:43,524 --> 00:06:47,361
There's a conversation
l'm glad l missed the beginning of.

102
00:06:51,991 --> 00:06:56,078
- Sorry l'm late.
- Did you ask your dad about the date?

103
00:06:56,245 --> 00:06:58,289
- He's not interested.
- Darn it.

104
00:06:58,455 --> 00:07:01,959
l got her hopes up.
Would you consider going out with her?

105
00:07:02,126 --> 00:07:04,753
Sorry. l've had my quota of pity dates.

106
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:08,716
But this time you wouldn't be
the one being pitied.

107
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:13,595
We have a great call
to start the show off with.

108
00:07:13,762 --> 00:07:17,349
The guy on line three
found out his girlfriend is his sister!

109
00:07:17,516 --> 00:07:18,976
Wow!

110
00:07:19,143 --> 00:07:22,020
- That German woman called back.
- Gretchen?

111
00:07:22,187 --> 00:07:24,356
- Yeah.
- l want her first.

112
00:07:24,523 --> 00:07:26,984
What do l say
to the guy dating his sister?

113
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:30,070
Tell him to hang on.
We've all been there.

114
00:07:33,865 --> 00:07:37,119
Hello, Seattle.
This is Dr Frasier Crane on KACL.

115
00:07:37,286 --> 00:07:39,121
Roz?

116
00:07:39,288 --> 00:07:41,581
Gretchen's calling
about her husband's affair.

117
00:07:41,748 --> 00:07:44,126
She thinks she has more evidence.

118
00:07:44,292 --> 00:07:48,630
- l'm listening.
- (Gretchen) 'l took Roz's advice.

119
00:07:48,797 --> 00:07:51,633
'l gave my husband
two choices for dinner

120
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:55,137
'and he picked the diet plate!'

121
00:07:55,303 --> 00:07:57,764
That is no proof he's having an affair.

122
00:07:57,931 --> 00:08:01,017
- 'But Gunnar has a healthy appetite.'
- No, no, no.

123
00:08:01,184 --> 00:08:05,480
The proof is...phone bills,
credit card receipts... Gunnar?

124
00:08:09,442 --> 00:08:12,070
l also found a love letter.

125
00:08:12,237 --> 00:08:14,698
How long were you
going to keep that secret?

126
00:08:14,864 --> 00:08:16,908
What does it say?

127
00:08:17,075 --> 00:08:19,369
(Gretchen speaks German)

128
00:08:19,536 --> 00:08:24,749
- l'm sorry. l don't speak German.
- 'lt's means my little liver dumpling.

129
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:29,963
- 'That used to be his pet name for me.'
- Maybe he's writing to you.

130
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:34,259
'lt can't be me. He says he loves
her beautiful, little body,

131
00:08:34,425 --> 00:08:38,096
'as thin as his sword
and her skin as white as bratwurst,

132
00:08:38,263 --> 00:08:41,975
<i>'and that she's
his nicht eine menschliche Frau. '</i>

133
00:08:42,141 --> 00:08:46,729
- What is that?
- 'l don't know if there's an English word.

134
00:08:46,896 --> 00:08:52,360
'The closest translation
is ''not quite human woman''.'

135
00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:00,201
- Dear God. lt is her.
- 'What should l do?'

136
00:09:00,368 --> 00:09:04,330
l don't know. l need time to think.
Let's go to commercial.

137
00:09:09,168 --> 00:09:12,713
Hello. Gretchen,
l have considered your problem.

138
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:17,218
You must confront your husband
and insist that he end this affair.

139
00:09:17,385 --> 00:09:21,681
- (Gretchen) 'What if he won't?'
- But innocent people are being hurt.

140
00:09:21,847 --> 00:09:24,809
Tell him how much he means to you.
Are there children?

141
00:09:24,976 --> 00:09:28,479
- 'No.'
- Damn!

142
00:09:28,646 --> 00:09:32,525
Still, it must be a clean break.
He must never see this woman again.

143
00:09:32,692 --> 00:09:35,194
'We never had
these problems back home.'

144
00:09:35,361 --> 00:09:39,365
Maybe you should return
to the loving bosom of Bavaria.

145
00:09:39,532 --> 00:09:42,910
'How did you know
we were from Bavaria?'

146
00:09:46,247 --> 00:09:48,499
Well, l'm a master of dialect.

147
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:53,587
l noticed there was a glottal quality
to the occlusion of your diphthongs.

148
00:09:53,754 --> 00:09:56,549
'l'm originally from Austria.'

149
00:09:56,715 --> 00:10:00,010
Do you want to split hairs
or get your husband back?

150
00:10:00,177 --> 00:10:02,513
lt's time for another commercial.

151
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:06,475
- Another commercial?
- Yes, another commercial!

152
00:10:08,686 --> 00:10:10,729
What is going on?

153
00:10:10,896 --> 00:10:12,940
Why do you think something's going on?

154
00:10:13,107 --> 00:10:17,403
When the person giving advice
sounds crazier than the caller,

155
00:10:17,569 --> 00:10:19,947
l think something's going on.

156
00:10:20,114 --> 00:10:22,491
Nothing's going on.

157
00:10:22,658 --> 00:10:26,245
You know who the liver dumpling is,
don't you?

158
00:10:27,871 --> 00:10:32,543
Yes. But it's nobody you know.
Her husband's a friend of mine.

159
00:10:32,709 --> 00:10:36,171
- How can l tell him?
- Don't tell the person being cheated on.

160
00:10:36,338 --> 00:10:40,425
Confront the person who's cheating.
Didn't Harvard teach you anything?

161
00:10:40,592 --> 00:10:42,594
l can't do that.

162
00:10:42,761 --> 00:10:46,473
You tell her you know
she's been mattress surfing

163
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,767
and if she won't stop, you'll tell.

164
00:10:49,851 --> 00:10:54,398
lt's not that easy. You don't know her.
She can't deal with confrontation.

165
00:10:54,564 --> 00:10:56,983
l once questioned her for serving veal

166
00:10:57,150 --> 00:11:01,196
and we found her in the garage
with the engine running on a golf cart.

167
00:11:01,363 --> 00:11:04,074
Whoa, it's Maris!

168
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:15,919
(Woman speaks Spanish)

169
00:11:16,086 --> 00:11:18,338
Mrs Crane is in the box?

170
00:11:24,719 --> 00:11:27,847
Maris! This is Frasier.

171
00:11:28,014 --> 00:11:31,351
l'm tired of waiting for you
to come out of this ridiculous tank.

172
00:11:31,518 --> 00:11:33,770
We've got to talk about Niles.

173
00:11:34,854 --> 00:11:36,898
Will you come out of there?

174
00:11:37,774 --> 00:11:39,818
Look, Maris...

175
00:11:41,277 --> 00:11:43,530
l know you're having an affair.

176
00:11:44,614 --> 00:11:49,327
l care for you both and l want to help
you do what's best for your marriage.

177
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:52,914
Will you stop this?

178
00:11:54,207 --> 00:11:57,043
Just come... Come out of this box!

179
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:59,754
All right, l'm going to open the door.

180
00:11:59,921 --> 00:12:03,508
l'm going to count to three.
l don't care if you're naked.

181
00:12:03,675 --> 00:12:05,718
l'm going to count to ten.

182
00:12:07,804 --> 00:12:10,014
To hell with this! All right!

183
00:12:20,608 --> 00:12:23,486
Niles, l'm so sorry.

184
00:12:23,653 --> 00:12:26,614
Marta, you said
Mrs Crane was in the box?

185
00:12:26,781 --> 00:12:30,076
- Si, Missy Crane.
- That's Mr Crane!

186
00:12:31,202 --> 00:12:34,330
Marta has trouble with her pronouns.

187
00:12:39,543 --> 00:12:43,672
- l'm worried. He's sensitive.
- You're right.

188
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:48,636
Maybe we shouldn't let on how worried
we are. lt will add to his anxiety.

189
00:12:48,803 --> 00:12:51,222
lf we coddle him,
he'll think the world's ended.

190
00:12:51,388 --> 00:12:53,432
(Doorbell)

191
00:12:55,726 --> 00:12:57,937
- Hello, Niles.
- Hi, Son.

192
00:12:59,813 --> 00:13:05,110
lt's OK. lt's OK, Niles. Come on.

193
00:13:05,277 --> 00:13:07,321
lt's all right.

194
00:13:08,739 --> 00:13:12,284
- We're all here for you, son.
- My little brother.

195
00:13:13,243 --> 00:13:15,663
Frasier, pour him a glass of brandy.

196
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:21,085
Yes. Oh, God. l'm all out of brandy.
l have a marvellous sherry,

197
00:13:21,251 --> 00:13:25,839
some fine ports and a lovely bottle
of 1 2-year-old unblended Scotch.

198
00:13:26,006 --> 00:13:29,468
- lt's a bit peaty...
- Just pour him a drink!

199
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:33,889
- What happened, son?
- Nothing.

200
00:13:34,056 --> 00:13:36,350
Nothing?
When l left, you were about to

201
00:13:36,517 --> 00:13:39,394
storm up to her room
and have it out with her?

202
00:13:39,561 --> 00:13:44,274
l thought of questions to fire at her,
but when l reached her door l froze.

203
00:13:44,441 --> 00:13:49,112
l turned and walked out of the house,
got in the car and started driving.

204
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,323
l'm glad you ended up here.

205
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:54,660
Actually, l ended up
at the Oregon border check.

206
00:13:56,745 --> 00:14:00,624
l had fruit in the car,
so l had to turn back.

207
00:14:07,214 --> 00:14:10,133
What will l do? She's my whole life.

208
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:15,096
She may have temporarily succumbed
to Gunnar's Teutonic charms,

209
00:14:15,263 --> 00:14:20,644
but in the end l'm sure she'll choose
the man who's intelligent and sensitive.

210
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:25,565
Frasier, that's just something
we used to tell ourselves in chess club.

211
00:14:30,195 --> 00:14:33,406
The truth is
women don't want men of intellect.

212
00:14:33,573 --> 00:14:35,742
They want men of action, like Gunnar.

213
00:14:35,909 --> 00:14:39,621
lt has nothing to do with Gunnar.
lt's about you and Maris.

214
00:14:39,788 --> 00:14:43,249
Remember your advice
when l had problems with Lilith?

215
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:47,921
You said l should talk to her
and find out why she did what she did.

216
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:51,633
lt's one thing to give advice,
another to take it.

217
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:58,932
Frase, didn't you and Lilith write articles
on the keys to a successful marriage?

218
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:02,101
- Yes.
- lt might help Niles to read them.

219
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:04,312
Well, all right.

220
00:15:04,479 --> 00:15:08,316
l've only got half. Lilith got the rest
in the divorce settlement.

221
00:15:10,777 --> 00:15:14,906
Now that we got rid of the foghorn,
here's the way to handle it.

222
00:15:15,073 --> 00:15:18,201
Remember this happened
between your mother and l?

223
00:15:18,367 --> 00:15:21,871
- Right.
- Well, l took it up with the other man.

224
00:15:22,038 --> 00:15:25,875
l told him if it ever happened again,
he'd be the other woman.

225
00:15:26,042 --> 00:15:28,252
There was a lot more that we had to do

226
00:15:28,419 --> 00:15:33,049
to keep our marriage together,
but at least she knew how much l cared.

227
00:15:33,216 --> 00:15:37,845
Should l grab Gunnar by the scruff
of the neck and throw him out?

228
00:15:38,012 --> 00:15:40,848
- Why not?
- l've been fantasising about it.

229
00:15:41,015 --> 00:15:44,894
lt's just not me, though.
Although maybe it should be me.

230
00:15:45,061 --> 00:15:47,688
No, l've got to speak to Maris eventually.

231
00:15:47,855 --> 00:15:52,693
Although, if l do it your way,
l'm going at it from a position of strength.

232
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:57,656
l'll do it, Dad. Tonight it's Gunnar
who will be taught a lesson.

233
00:15:57,823 --> 00:16:01,827
- That's my boy. Sure you're up to it?
- Yes, l am.

234
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:07,166
l'm pumped, l'm psyched and l just
swallowed an entire twist of lemon.

235
00:16:08,042 --> 00:16:11,754
- Did l just hear Niles leave?
- He went to straighten out Gunnar.

236
00:16:11,921 --> 00:16:16,842
God, Dad, how could you let him go?
What if Gunnar wants to fight?

237
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:20,512
lt's still better this way.
He's found his manhood.

238
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:24,266
l'll be happy if he traded in
some teeth for his cojones.

239
00:16:28,437 --> 00:16:32,483
l've got to stop walking in
on the middle of conversations.

240
00:16:41,325 --> 00:16:45,245
There you are.
Yes, l'm talking to you, strudel boy!

241
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:50,042
No one gets away
with seducing my wife.

242
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:55,422
You probably thought, because of my
swimmer's build, l wouldn't fight for her,

243
00:16:55,589 --> 00:16:59,676
but you're wrong, because real men
have a thing called honour.

244
00:16:59,843 --> 00:17:02,095
Yow!

245
00:17:02,262 --> 00:17:04,306
You wouldn't know about that.

246
00:17:04,473 --> 00:17:06,558
- Niles.
- You don't know how to behave.

247
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:09,227
You don't know
the meaning of rectitude.

248
00:17:09,394 --> 00:17:13,273
He doesn't know the meaning of dog.
He doesn't speak English!

249
00:17:14,816 --> 00:17:18,111
(Speaking in German)

250
00:17:18,278 --> 00:17:20,113
Marta?

251
00:17:21,031 --> 00:17:23,074
You speak German?

252
00:17:27,871 --> 00:17:29,915
(Speaking Spanish)

253
00:17:34,878 --> 00:17:39,341
She worked for a German family
that turned up in Guatemala...

254
00:17:39,507 --> 00:17:41,551
just after the war.

255
00:17:45,472 --> 00:17:48,308
Good. She can translate.
Tell her to tell him...

256
00:17:48,475 --> 00:17:50,518
Niles, just wait!

257
00:17:50,685 --> 00:17:54,939
lf he knew you were calling him strudel
boy, he'd wipe his feet on your face.

258
00:17:55,106 --> 00:17:58,443
lf there are scuffs,
they'll be scuffs of honour.

259
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:01,946
How dare you steal my wife!
Translate.

260
00:18:02,113 --> 00:18:04,073
All right.

261
00:18:04,991 --> 00:18:07,285
(Frasier speaks Spanish)

262
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:15,460
(Marta translates in German)

263
00:18:20,256 --> 00:18:23,092
All right, fine,
you want to challenge me?

264
00:18:23,259 --> 00:18:25,303
En garde!

265
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:28,598
That's just what we need,
a fourth language!

266
00:18:30,558 --> 00:18:32,810
You can't possibly fight this man.

267
00:18:32,977 --> 00:18:36,355
You forget.
l've been fencing since prep school.

268
00:18:36,522 --> 00:18:39,442
So what?
He was born with a sword in his hand.

269
00:18:39,609 --> 00:18:42,361
He probably performed
his own Caesarean.

270
00:18:45,573 --> 00:18:47,617
My God. He's going to kill me.

271
00:19:07,178 --> 00:19:09,930
Oh, very nice, very nice. Thank you.

272
00:20:01,189 --> 00:20:03,066
Niles!

273
00:20:04,526 --> 00:20:06,570
Are you all right?

274
00:20:08,196 --> 00:20:10,741
(Speaking German)

275
00:20:10,907 --> 00:20:13,535
ls he giving up?

276
00:20:15,078 --> 00:20:19,249
He wants you to apologise.
He didn't steal...your shoes.

277
00:20:27,674 --> 00:20:30,468
- My shoes?
- Yes, l'm sorry.

278
00:20:31,636 --> 00:20:34,264
Apparently, l mistranslated.

279
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:38,685
He didn't mean... Not shoes, wife.

280

(Marta translates in Spanish)

285

He couldn't help it.
Maris is irresistible... lrresistible?!

286

(Marta translates)

287
00:21:08,089 --> 00:21:09,757
OK.

288
00:21:14,804 --> 00:21:16,973
- But she refused him.
- Really?

289
00:21:25,231 --> 00:21:27,316
What did Maris say?

290
00:21:27,483 --> 00:21:29,527
(Marta translates)

291
00:21:33,823 --> 00:21:36,075
''l love Niles.''

292
00:21:37,702 --> 00:21:40,329
Oh, she loves me.
My Maris is home.

293
00:21:41,998 --> 00:21:44,834
ln five seconds,
tell him he's fired. Maris!

294
00:21:47,253 --> 00:21:50,256
lf only l could help
Gunnar and Gretchen.

295
00:21:52,633 --> 00:21:54,969
Tell him his wife loves him very much.

No, no, not me, you! You!
