1
00:00:09,492 --> 00:00:13,704
Brian, let me assure you,
no one is a born scatterbrain.

2
00:00:13,871 --> 00:00:16,415
Just develop
your powers of concentration.

3
00:00:16,582 --> 00:00:21,504
On a trip to the Amazon l observed
the hunters of the Shipibo tribe.

4
00:00:22,421 --> 00:00:27,385
With only a crude blowgun they bring
down monkeys from the forest canopy.

5
00:00:27,551 --> 00:00:30,971
How? Focus and mental discipline.

6
00:00:31,138 --> 00:00:36,936
We must work on that. Focus
on one thing and not get distracted...

7
00:00:37,103 --> 00:00:40,314
We've been nominated for a SeaBea!

8
00:00:41,357 --> 00:00:46,278
But not so single-minded that we
can't be spontaneous. We'll be back.

9
00:00:46,445 --> 00:00:49,782
Oh, Roz! This is wonderful!
Two years in a row!

10
00:00:49,949 --> 00:00:52,826
They like me! They really like me!

11
00:00:52,993 --> 00:00:56,163
l have to lose
five pounds in two weeks!

12
00:00:56,330 --> 00:01:00,626
That'll be enough of that. Oh, Roz,
l bought this for you this morning.

13
00:01:00,793 --> 00:01:04,338
l was hoping l wouldn't have to say
it was just for being you.

14
00:01:04,505 --> 00:01:06,590
Thanks, Frasier.

15
00:01:06,757 --> 00:01:12,262
This is great! Last year l wanted to
win so much l didn't even enjoy it.

16
00:01:12,429 --> 00:01:14,515
This year, l don't care.

17
00:01:14,681 --> 00:01:18,310
l'll buy a beautiful dress,
have my hair done,

18
00:01:18,477 --> 00:01:21,313
stretch out in the limo with my date...

19
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,774
Why bother having your hair done?

20
00:01:23,941 --> 00:01:26,693
Hey, Doc! Congratulations!

21
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:29,071
Hey, Roz! Oh, OK.

22
00:01:30,989 --> 00:01:35,702
Congratulations to you, too.
Four nominations, three wins.

23
00:01:35,869 --> 00:01:40,374
l've been a symbol of broadcasting
excellence in Seattle since 1991 .

24
00:01:41,708 --> 00:01:43,752
(Bulldog barks)

25
00:01:47,214 --> 00:01:49,216
See ya, Doc.

26
00:01:49,383 --> 00:01:51,927
- 30 seconds.
- Whom do we have?

27
00:01:52,094 --> 00:01:57,140
Line one is a Bainbridge shoplifter.
Line two is your ''No.1 fan.''

28
00:01:57,307 --> 00:02:00,060
- Kari?
- Fourth time this week.

29
00:02:00,227 --> 00:02:03,313
All she does is gush
and say you're wonderful.

30
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,107
And this hurts me how?

31
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:14,658
Hello, Seattle. Time for one call.
So, Roz, who do we have on the line?

32
00:02:14,824 --> 00:02:16,910
Oh, please.

33
00:02:18,453 --> 00:02:22,874
- Hello. You're on with Frasier Crane.
- (Kari) 'Hi, Dr Crane. lt's me, Kari.

34
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:28,463
'Nervous as usual. l hope you're not
sick of me. l think you're wonderful.

35
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:30,673
'Thank you for talking to me.

36
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,969
- Thank you for being so sweet.
- 'Thank you for giving good advice.'

37
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:37,722
Thank you for...

38
00:02:37,889 --> 00:02:40,391
Sorry. lf that's all...

39
00:02:40,558 --> 00:02:44,395
- 'That was a beautiful rose you bought.'
- l bought it for...

40
00:02:45,855 --> 00:02:49,609
- Excuse me?
- 'Don't be surprised. l saw you.

41
00:02:49,776 --> 00:02:53,071
- 'Not your regular routine.'
- My regular routine?

42
00:02:53,237 --> 00:02:58,659
'Café Nervosa. You go every morning.
Except today. l'm boring you. Bye.'

43
00:02:58,826 --> 00:03:01,329
Goodbye, Kari.

44
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:07,085
That's all for today, Seattle.
Goodbye and good listening.

45
00:03:08,836 --> 00:03:11,297
That was weird. She's following you?

46
00:03:11,464 --> 00:03:13,925
She's hardly following me.

47
00:03:14,091 --> 00:03:17,929
She may go to Café Nervosa.
The florist is next door.

48
00:03:18,095 --> 00:03:21,933
Be careful out there.
There's a lot of creeps.

49
00:03:22,099 --> 00:03:26,479
l've met lots of odd people and
l've never called any of them a creep.

50
00:03:26,646 --> 00:03:30,775
Stop wearing corduroys.
l can't see your panty line.

51
00:03:30,983 --> 00:03:35,863
Although, some people do send me
groping for synonyms.

52
00:03:44,789 --> 00:03:48,751
- What are you up to?
- Measuring your father for his tuxedo.

53
00:03:48,918 --> 00:03:53,339
That reminds me.
Maris can't make your awards.

54
00:03:53,506 --> 00:03:55,925
Colour me surprised. Any reason?

55
00:03:56,967 --> 00:03:58,802
Yes.

56
00:03:58,969 --> 00:04:02,556
lt's a good one.
She's upset about her manicurist.

57
00:04:04,391 --> 00:04:08,604
She's done Maris's nails for years
and she's been taken critically ill.

58
00:04:08,771 --> 00:04:10,939
How bad is she?

59
00:04:11,106 --> 00:04:14,777
She'll be fine
when she finds another manicurist.

60
00:04:14,943 --> 00:04:18,447
For now she's curtailed
all public appearances.

61
00:04:18,614 --> 00:04:21,742
l'm sorry. lt's not like
l'm nominated every year.

62
00:04:21,909 --> 00:04:24,077
Oh, wait a minute. Yes, it is!

63
00:04:26,038 --> 00:04:30,459
As someone once said, ''Popularity
is the hallmark of mediocrity.''

64
00:04:30,626 --> 00:04:33,712
- You just made that up.
- Yes, but l stand by it.

65
00:04:34,796 --> 00:04:37,382
Are you joining us for dinner, Dr Crane?

66
00:04:37,549 --> 00:04:39,635
No. We're going to the opera.

67
00:04:39,801 --> 00:04:43,764
- We're seeing...
- ''Der Fliegende Holländer''.

68
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:47,100
Don't forget the tickets
are in your briefcase.

69
00:04:47,267 --> 00:04:49,895
l can hear that first aria.

70
00:04:50,687 --> 00:04:55,942
Don't, Niles. You'll sing it, then l will,
and l won't get it out of my head!

71
00:04:57,486 --> 00:04:59,488
What's this?

72
00:04:59,654 --> 00:05:03,658
''Dear Dr Crane. A little bit of me
to wrap around your neck.

73
00:05:03,825 --> 00:05:06,286
''Your No.1 fan, Kari.''

74
00:05:06,453 --> 00:05:09,414
How sweet.
Your fan knitted you a scarf.

75
00:05:09,581 --> 00:05:13,877
My case was with me all day,
expect at the barber's.

76
00:05:14,044 --> 00:05:17,631
That didn't give her
more than 30 seconds.

77
00:05:22,177 --> 00:05:25,680
She followed you
then slipped a scarf into your case?

78
00:05:25,847 --> 00:05:30,018
- She's a devoted fan.
- With the handwriting of a sociopath.

79
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:33,438
Big loops.

80
00:05:33,605 --> 00:05:36,775
That's how they caught
the ''Butcher of Brighton''.

81
00:05:36,941 --> 00:05:39,402
He used big loops. A sign of anger.

82
00:05:39,569 --> 00:05:43,323
He crossed his T's downwards,
indicating aggression.

83
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:48,411
He also kept a Demitasse saucer
full of eyelids on his night table.

84
00:05:51,372 --> 00:05:54,542
Should we put a two-way lock
on her door?

85
00:05:57,795 --> 00:06:01,215
There are weirdos around,
so keep your eyes open.

86
00:06:01,382 --> 00:06:04,177
She's not weird.
She just finds me fascinating.

87
00:06:04,344 --> 00:06:06,387
The distinction would be?

88
00:06:08,723 --> 00:06:11,893
Her invading my space is inappropriate

89
00:06:12,059 --> 00:06:15,480
but l hardly think
we should barricade the door.

90
00:06:15,646 --> 00:06:20,443
First phone calls, then spying,
then she was in your briefcase.

91
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:25,740
The predator is stalking its prey
in ever narrowing circles or ''loops''.

92
00:06:25,907 --> 00:06:28,284
- That's for you, Daphne.
- Thank you.

93
00:06:28,451 --> 00:06:29,869
(Doorbell)

94
00:06:30,036 --> 00:06:33,956
You make me sound like a goat being
staked out. No one's hunting me down.

95
00:06:34,123 --> 00:06:37,043
No one is closing in on me.

96
00:06:38,169 --> 00:06:41,172
Look! These must be from the station!

97
00:06:43,257 --> 00:06:45,509
''From your No.1 fan, Kari.

98
00:06:46,594 --> 00:06:50,389
''Your time has come.
You're going to get what you deserve.''

99
00:06:50,556 --> 00:06:53,142
The loop tightens.

100
00:06:53,309 --> 00:06:57,438
Stop it, Niles!
She means it's time l won this award.

101
00:06:57,605 --> 00:07:00,774
You will not turn me
into a nervous wreck.

102
00:07:00,941 --> 00:07:02,651
(Balloon bursts)

103
00:07:05,863 --> 00:07:08,532
lt's just not going to happen!

104
00:07:12,995 --> 00:07:16,123
(Man) 'l don't understand it.
l'm a successful guy.

105
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:20,169
'l have my own car dealership,
but l'm depressed.

106
00:07:20,335 --> 00:07:23,047
'You may have heard of me -
Madman Martinez.'

107
00:07:23,213 --> 00:07:26,049
What's the source of your depression,
Madman?

108
00:07:26,216 --> 00:07:30,179
'l guess it's just that business is down.
l don't know why.

109
00:07:30,345 --> 00:07:32,806
'l slashed prices this week.

110
00:07:32,973 --> 00:07:35,350
'l've an '88 Olds Cutlass on the lot

111
00:07:35,517 --> 00:07:40,272
'in rare turquoise metallic,
cordova roof, leather...

112
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:46,236
'And there's six brand-new Supras,
with a 20% discount to listeners.

113
00:07:46,403 --> 00:07:49,823
'People say, ''You're crazy!''
l say, ''l deal in volume!'''

114
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:52,200
Fortunately, so do l.

115
00:07:52,367 --> 00:07:54,494
Our time's up, folks.

116
00:07:54,661 --> 00:08:01,251
Stay tuned for Bob Bulldog Briscoe
after these paid commercial messages.

117
00:08:03,378 --> 00:08:06,631
Roz, you're supposed
to screen the calls.

118
00:08:06,798 --> 00:08:09,801
Just douse me in gasoline
and toss me a match.

119
00:08:09,968 --> 00:08:12,470
l hoped a stern warning would do.

120
00:08:12,637 --> 00:08:14,973
l'm talking about this.

121
00:08:16,266 --> 00:08:21,062
Three hours till a limo picks me up
and my nose erupts like Krakatoa!

122
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:27,861
- lt's barely noticeable.
- From where? The space shuttle?

123
00:08:29,112 --> 00:08:31,156
Vintage Roz, or what?

124
00:08:31,323 --> 00:08:36,244
l finally lose five pounds
and l gain three of it back on my nose!

125
00:08:36,411 --> 00:08:40,623
l'm sure that with enough foundation
and some contouring,

126
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:43,251
maybe a little shadowing.

127
00:08:43,418 --> 00:08:47,338
Have you considered wearing
a beekeeper's mask?

128
00:08:49,007 --> 00:08:52,468
Do l make fun of that astrodome
you call a forehead?

129
00:08:56,973 --> 00:09:00,268
lt's been a tough week for me, too.

130
00:09:00,435 --> 00:09:05,106
Kari's put notes in my briefcase.
She's even been to my apartment.

131
00:09:05,273 --> 00:09:09,110
You have to do something.
Remember Leo the Happy Chef?

132
00:09:09,277 --> 00:09:14,782
He had an obsessed fan, too. lt started
innocently, then she got into his house.

133
00:09:14,949 --> 00:09:18,202
She bent his whisk
and scratched his Teflon!

134
00:09:19,412 --> 00:09:21,581
She made his life miserable.

135
00:09:21,747 --> 00:09:25,626
She didn't quit until he hired
a bodyguard. Should l find out who?

136
00:09:25,793 --> 00:09:28,671
No. l can't believe Kari
poses a real threat.

137
00:09:28,838 --> 00:09:33,426
She hasn't even looked at me
face-to-face. She's had the chance.

138
00:09:33,593 --> 00:09:37,930
Suit yourself. But if you ask me,
she's acting very weird.

139
00:09:39,015 --> 00:09:44,520
- Tea good for your nose?
- No, l found a bag to match my shoes(!)

140
00:09:45,896 --> 00:09:49,358
You're dripping all over the console.

141
00:09:49,525 --> 00:09:51,694
Oh, my goodness.

142
00:09:51,861 --> 00:09:54,947
- Kari.
- How did she get in your jacket?

143
00:09:55,114 --> 00:09:58,451
l have no idea.
''l'm disappointed in you, Dr Crane.

144
00:09:58,617 --> 00:10:01,328
''You didn't wear my scarf.

145
00:10:01,495 --> 00:10:05,457
''The last man
who disappointed me that way...

146
00:10:05,624 --> 00:10:07,668
''is in his grave.''

147
00:10:08,794 --> 00:10:14,592
''l'll be at the awards and l'll be
looking for you. Your No.1 fan, Kari.''

148
00:10:14,758 --> 00:10:20,055
Great! And l'm sitting at your table
with a bull's-eye on my nose.

149
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,815
Dr Crane, you've got to try to relax.

150
00:10:29,982 --> 00:10:32,776
Yes. What do l have
to be nervous about?

151
00:10:32,943 --> 00:10:35,696
lf l lose this award, l'll be devastated.

152
00:10:35,863 --> 00:10:41,201
lf l win, my mad stalker will have
a clear shot when l accept.

153
00:10:41,368 --> 00:10:44,746
Don't worry.
That's why you hired the bodyguard.

154
00:10:44,913 --> 00:10:49,710
l don't see why. Even if something
does happen, l was a cop for 30 years.

155
00:10:49,876 --> 00:10:51,920
lt's a waste of money.

156
00:10:52,087 --> 00:10:57,676
They're skilled bodyguards, trained
to size up a crowd, plan an escape.

157
00:10:57,843 --> 00:11:00,762
- Even get shot.
- l know how to take a bullet.

158
00:11:00,929 --> 00:11:05,142
That's just what your personality needs -
another bullet.

159
00:11:06,977 --> 00:11:08,437
(Doorbell)

160
00:11:08,603 --> 00:11:11,273
That must be him. Who is it?

161
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,068
Lizzie Borden.
Could you autograph my hatchet?

162
00:11:18,822 --> 00:11:21,032
That's not very funny.

163
00:11:21,199 --> 00:11:25,203
- Everyone ready to go?
- We're waiting for his rent-a-goon.

164
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:27,539
He's stuck in traffic.

165
00:11:27,706 --> 00:11:31,334
Or your admirer got to him first
and he's stuffed in a closet

166
00:11:31,501 --> 00:11:35,839
with a bloated tongue and
garrotted neck. ls that champagne?

167
00:11:38,383 --> 00:11:40,719
You're a fountain of comfort!

168
00:11:40,885 --> 00:11:45,765
l'm just teasing. l'm a little jealous.
l told Maris about your troubles.

169
00:11:45,932 --> 00:11:48,768
All she does is sulk
and talk about bodyguards.

170
00:11:48,935 --> 00:11:51,896
''Aren't we important enough
to be stalked?''

171
00:11:53,982 --> 00:11:56,234
l don't know what to say to her.

172
00:11:56,401 --> 00:11:59,529
Tell her to go on being herself.
Her day will come.

173
00:12:00,572 --> 00:12:02,824
(Doorbell)

174
00:12:02,991 --> 00:12:05,118
That must be my muscle.

175
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:10,581
lt's a woman!
Where's my bodyguard now?

176
00:12:10,748 --> 00:12:14,669
lt's Cindy Carruthers
from the Unified Protection Agency.

177
00:12:14,836 --> 00:12:17,547
Your bodyguard's named ''Cindy''?

178
00:12:17,714 --> 00:12:20,174
Were they all out of ''Tiffanys''?

179
00:12:21,718 --> 00:12:27,223
l was expecting someone big and wide.
A Dominic, a Rocco, a Ruth, even.

180
00:12:29,433 --> 00:12:31,769
Hello. l'm so glad to see you.

181
00:12:31,936 --> 00:12:35,356
Thank you, Dr Crane.
But you made a fatal mistake.

182
00:12:35,523 --> 00:12:37,567
Oh, my God! lt is Kari!

183
00:12:37,733 --> 00:12:41,946
You should have called for
a description before you let me in.

184
00:12:42,113 --> 00:12:44,657
Hi, Tina. Bring the car around.

185
00:12:44,824 --> 00:12:48,911
- Tina?
- l guess Candy was busy.

186
00:12:49,912 --> 00:12:52,540
First rule:
''Trust no one you don't know.''

187
00:12:52,707 --> 00:12:55,000
Let me write that down!

188
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:59,004
You're right.
l just feel silly when l act paranoid.

189
00:12:59,171 --> 00:13:02,508
- Don't. Paranoid is good.
- l was paranoid.

190
00:13:05,344 --> 00:13:07,388
Who are these people?

191
00:13:08,305 --> 00:13:10,766
My brother, Dr Niles Crane,
my father, Martin,

192
00:13:10,933 --> 00:13:13,853
and his care specialist, Daphne Moon.

193
00:13:14,019 --> 00:13:17,648
You've seen a bit of mayhem
in your day, haven't you?

194
00:13:17,815 --> 00:13:21,986
- Excuse me?
- l sense these things. l'm psychic.

195
00:13:22,152 --> 00:13:24,154
Wait, l'm getting a flash now.

196
00:13:24,321 --> 00:13:29,243
Did your grandfather
have a steel plate in his head?

197
00:13:30,202 --> 00:13:34,581
This lunatic who's been calling you.
Any particular accent?

198
00:13:34,748 --> 00:13:36,583
No.

199
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:42,214
- You have a security system?
- We don't need one. We've got Eddie.

200
00:13:42,381 --> 00:13:44,466
Hello, Eddie.

201
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:53,934
Don't be fooled. Touch me and
you'd get a ball-sized bite in your butt.

202
00:13:54,101 --> 00:13:56,353
And Eddie would go for your ankles.

203
00:13:59,481 --> 00:14:01,984
Look at the time. Shouldn't we go?

204
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:06,196
l'll secure the elevator.
Don't open the door for anyone.

205
00:14:06,363 --> 00:14:10,575
l need your blood type,
where the nearest trauma centre is,

206
00:14:10,742 --> 00:14:14,037
and which family members
would donate organs.

207
00:14:15,956 --> 00:14:19,793
Just so you know,
l have unusually small kidneys.

208
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:22,671
(Phone rings)

209
00:14:22,838 --> 00:14:25,715
Hello. Crane residence.

210
00:14:25,882 --> 00:14:28,677
- l think it's her.
- Niles, call Cindy.

211
00:14:28,843 --> 00:14:31,137
Put her on speaker.

212
00:14:33,974 --> 00:14:39,437
(Kari) 'l know you're rushed, but l wanted
to say l'll be wearing a red dress.

213
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,484
'But don't worry about finding me.
l'll find you.

214
00:14:46,069 --> 00:14:49,030
- 'Bye!'
- Kari, wait!

215
00:14:51,825 --> 00:14:54,869
Don't let it bother you so.
Come on. Let's go.

216
00:14:55,036 --> 00:15:01,417
l find it hard to imagine a woman with
such a sweet voice being dangerous.

217
00:15:01,584 --> 00:15:05,380
Does the name ''Squeaky'' Fromme
mean anything to you?

218
00:15:13,638 --> 00:15:17,642
There's a lot of red dresses
so let's go over some rules.

219
00:15:17,809 --> 00:15:21,396
Don't go anywhere alone.
Go to the men's room with a buddy.

220
00:15:21,562 --> 00:15:23,773
Always keep your back to the wall.

221
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:27,235
That'll take some marksmanship.

222
00:15:27,402 --> 00:15:30,863
l think l see her.
Red dress, standing by the bar.

223
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:34,283
She's staring at all the men
but hiding her face.

224
00:15:36,911 --> 00:15:41,332
That is my producer. She's harmless.
She has a pimple on her nose.

225
00:15:41,499 --> 00:15:44,001
Looks like a biblical plague.

226
00:15:44,168 --> 00:15:46,671
Roz, over here.
Give me that.

227
00:15:46,837 --> 00:15:49,840
You look beautiful. Come join us.

228
00:15:50,007 --> 00:15:53,135
- Hi. l'm Cindy Carruthers.
- Hi.

229
00:15:53,302 --> 00:15:55,638
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, Roz.

230
00:15:55,805 --> 00:15:57,848
Just stop that.

231
00:15:58,015 --> 00:16:02,895
You look terrific. You've done
a great job. lt's almost disappeared.

232
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:08,359
Whoa, Roz!
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?

233
00:16:11,654 --> 00:16:15,282
- And who's this lovely lady?
- Cindy Carruthers.

234
00:16:15,449 --> 00:16:18,953
- She has a concealed weapon.
- Makes two of us.

235
00:16:19,954 --> 00:16:22,498
No kidding. She's his bodyguard.

236
00:16:22,665 --> 00:16:26,043
Wanna check out
a body worth guarding?

237
00:16:28,295 --> 00:16:30,631
lf l move my thumb l could kill you.

238
00:16:30,798 --> 00:16:33,342
l've never been so turned on.

239
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:36,470
OK, let me go.

240
00:16:37,346 --> 00:16:39,848
So can l call you?

241
00:16:43,143 --> 00:16:48,357
l wish she'd just make her move.
l hate thinking it could be anyone.

242
00:16:48,524 --> 00:16:50,567
You know she's wearing a red dress.

243
00:16:50,734 --> 00:16:53,153
- Maybe.
- What do you mean?

244
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,989
l'm no professional bodyguard,

245
00:16:56,156 --> 00:17:02,246
but if l was looking to whack a guy,
maybe l'd lie about what l was wearing.

246
00:17:02,412 --> 00:17:06,541
No offence to your father
but stick to looking for a red dress.

247
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:09,252
Here we are, good as new.

248
00:17:12,047 --> 00:17:14,841
Should we all head up to the ballroom?

249
00:17:15,008 --> 00:17:17,052
Help me.

250
00:17:18,929 --> 00:17:21,306
Niles, just hear me out on this.

251
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:27,354
Was it strange that Cindy dismissed
Dad's theory? She's not wearing red.

252
00:17:27,521 --> 00:17:31,608
You can't think she's the...
She couldn't... But how could...?

253
00:17:32,943 --> 00:17:38,240
Think about it. She was out of the
apartment when the stalker phoned.

254
00:17:38,406 --> 00:17:42,619
So she was. And we know
she has a cellular phone!

255
00:17:42,786 --> 00:17:45,288
But why hasn't she made her move?

256
00:17:45,455 --> 00:17:47,791
Maybe she wants to get you alone.

257
00:17:49,417 --> 00:17:53,088
Too many red dresses.
We'll take our own elevator.

258
00:17:59,886 --> 00:18:01,930
Don't be nervous.

259
00:18:02,096 --> 00:18:05,683
l'm not nervous.
Just a little chilly. lt's cold.

260
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:08,269
You should have worn a scarf.

261
00:18:09,812 --> 00:18:13,024
Yes, l should have. l meant to. Honest.

262
00:18:14,025 --> 00:18:16,402
Where's that elevator?

263
00:18:16,569 --> 00:18:19,572
l asked for this assignment.

264
00:18:19,739 --> 00:18:25,244
The truth is, l'm a fan of yours.
But l guess you figured that out.

265
00:18:25,411 --> 00:18:27,455
- Oh, my God!
- What?

266
00:18:27,622 --> 00:18:30,416
There! There, behind the bar!

267
00:18:37,131 --> 00:18:41,594
Frasier Crane? l've waited
for this moment for a long time.

268
00:18:41,761 --> 00:18:44,472
l'm your No.1 fan.

269
00:18:46,974 --> 00:18:50,061
- Roz! Find Cindy!
- Help me. Get him off me.

270
00:18:50,228 --> 00:18:53,981
lt's Mrs Littlejohn,
head of the nomination committee!

271
00:18:54,148 --> 00:18:58,694
This is a small world.
l know your brother, Aubrey.

272
00:18:58,861 --> 00:19:01,614
For God's sake, help the lady up.

273
00:19:01,781 --> 00:19:06,619
l'm so sorry. l've been stalked
by this woman named Kari.

274
00:19:06,786 --> 00:19:10,790
- When you said you'd been waiting...
- To get an autograph!

275
00:19:10,956 --> 00:19:14,668
- Who's got a pen?
- Thank you, no.

276
00:19:14,835 --> 00:19:19,048
Let's hope we win because
we won't get nominated next year.

277
00:19:19,215 --> 00:19:22,426
Have you changed your hairstyle?

278
00:19:22,593 --> 00:19:25,971
What happened?
Why did you run away from me?

279
00:19:26,138 --> 00:19:28,724
Paranoia has sent me crazy!

280
00:19:28,891 --> 00:19:33,103
First l thought you were the stalker,
then l thought she was.

281
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:37,691
l'm going to confront this!
Everyone, l will be in the lobby.

282
00:19:37,858 --> 00:19:41,695
- Just calm down.
- Dad, please. l will be in the lobby!

283
00:19:50,621 --> 00:19:53,373
You're Kari, aren't you?

284
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:56,084
How did you know?

285
00:19:56,251 --> 00:20:00,172
You made a scarf like that for Frasier.
He's my son.

286
00:20:00,339 --> 00:20:04,384
There's been a big misunderstanding.
l'm just a fan.

287
00:20:04,551 --> 00:20:06,595
l never meant to frighten him.

288
00:20:06,762 --> 00:20:11,141
What about that note about
that guy ending up in his grave?

289
00:20:11,308 --> 00:20:15,729
That meant my husband, Walter.
He caught pneumonia.

290
00:20:15,896 --> 00:20:20,150
l won't bother your son any more.
Could you tell him what happened?

291
00:20:20,317 --> 00:20:27,074
Yes. lf l'm lucky, he won't understand
and l'll have to explain again.

292
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:31,578
He'll understand. That's the one thing
about your son, Mr Crane.

293
00:20:31,745 --> 00:20:35,081
He's so smart and level-headed.

294
00:20:35,248 --> 00:20:38,543
What's she been smoking?

295
00:20:43,298 --> 00:20:46,468
l'm here, you demented harpy!

296
00:20:49,596 --> 00:20:51,640
Come and get me!

297
00:20:52,474 --> 00:20:54,309
Kari?

298
00:20:56,936 --> 00:20:58,772
Kari!

299
00:21:09,199 --> 00:21:12,327
l know you're here, so come on out.

300
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,375
Not so brave any more, huh?

301
00:21:19,542 --> 00:21:23,379
You think you're tough
but you have to hide in the shadows.

Want to see who's really tough?
Just come on out.

303
00:21:39,187 --> 00:21:45,818
When l said ''tough'', l was speaking
clearly in a rhetorical sense.

304
00:21:47,195 --> 00:21:50,573
Would...any of you
happen to have the time?

305
00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:56,704
Would...any of you...

306
00:21:56,871 --> 00:21:58,915
like the time?

307

(# Theme tune plays)

308
00:22:05,671 --> 00:22:10,468
# Hey baby, l hear the blues are calling
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

309

00:22:19,602 --> 00:22:26,066
# But l don't know what to do with those
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

312
00:22:26,233 --> 00:22:29,236
# They're calling again #

313
00:22:29,403 --> 00:22:31,822
# Scrambled egg's all over my face!

314
00:22:31,989 --> 00:22:35,910
# What is a boy to do? #

315
00:22:36,076 --> 00:22:39,371
Good night!
