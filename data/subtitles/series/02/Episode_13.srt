1
00:00:10,718 --> 00:00:15,014
That's it for today.
Goodbye and good listening.

2
00:00:16,599 --> 00:00:20,686
Little off our game today, Roz.
ls something wrong?

3
00:00:20,853 --> 00:00:23,439
Yes. l told a guy l love him.

4
00:00:23,606 --> 00:00:25,941
Somebody you know this time?

5
00:00:28,527 --> 00:00:30,988
You hate to hear about my love life.

6
00:00:31,155 --> 00:00:35,618
No, l care about you. lf you have
a problem and l can help, l'd love to.

7
00:00:35,784 --> 00:00:38,829
Just keep the details
on a need-to-know basis.

8
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:45,127
We've dated a couple of weeks
and last night he licked behind my ears...

9
00:00:45,294 --> 00:00:49,214
- Roz, is this...?
- Yes, you do need to know this.

10
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:55,095
Anyway, what l meant to say was,
''l love that.''

11
00:00:55,262 --> 00:00:58,307
But l yelled out, ''l love you!''

12
00:00:58,474 --> 00:01:03,771
He got a look on his face like
lndiana Jones running from the big ball.

13
00:01:04,688 --> 00:01:07,524
Do you love him?

14
00:01:07,691 --> 00:01:12,362
No, but l said it, so he should've
said it back. lt's just polite.

15
00:01:12,529 --> 00:01:17,409
There is no more emotionally-charged
phrase than ''l love you''.

16
00:01:17,576 --> 00:01:20,704
Some people can't say it.
lt makes them too vulnerable.

17
00:01:20,871 --> 00:01:26,043
My father's incapable of saying it,
even to me. But l know he does.

18
00:01:26,209 --> 00:01:30,922
He never told you he loves you?
God, that explains so much.

19
00:01:31,089 --> 00:01:33,675
What does that mean?

20
00:01:33,842 --> 00:01:36,845
You're so needy
that when a friend asks your advice,

21
00:01:37,012 --> 00:01:39,973
you steer the conversation
back to your own problems.

22
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:44,519
Anyway, l told this guy l love him.
How do l take it back?

23
00:01:44,686 --> 00:01:48,648
Remember l said l cared about you
and l'd like to help?

24
00:01:48,815 --> 00:01:51,276
l take it back.

25
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:58,783
(Eddie growls)

26
00:01:59,701 --> 00:02:03,288
Get out of there!
You'll get a fish-hook up your nose.

27
00:02:03,455 --> 00:02:05,957
Don't you ever clean that thing out?

28
00:02:06,124 --> 00:02:08,585
No, it's bad luck.

29
00:02:08,752 --> 00:02:13,923
You show up on a fishing trip with
a tackle box that doesn't smell rotten

30
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:16,342
and nobody will sit next to you.

31
00:02:17,844 --> 00:02:20,805
My multiple personality patients did that.

32
00:02:20,972 --> 00:02:24,225
They'd say the other one
had sent the cheque.

33
00:02:26,227 --> 00:02:28,479
What an odd combination of odours.

34
00:02:28,646 --> 00:02:33,735
Smells like a fish died
and all the other fish sent flowers.

35
00:02:35,737 --> 00:02:40,408
Yes, it's time for Dad's annual
ice fishing trip to Lake Nomahegan.

36
00:02:40,575 --> 00:02:42,619
Getting ready.

37
00:02:42,785 --> 00:02:47,373
Duke rented a cabin on the lake
and l'm bringing the bait and pork rinds.

38
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:52,003
l don't want you boys
throwing any wild parties.

39
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:55,339
How can we
if you're taking all the pork rinds?

40
00:02:56,799 --> 00:03:01,637
How could a fish be so dumb
as to put its mouth around... Ouch!

41
00:03:03,264 --> 00:03:05,308
(Phone rings)

42
00:03:07,143 --> 00:03:10,646
Hello? Yes, he's right here.

43
00:03:10,813 --> 00:03:13,107
lt's Duke.

44
00:03:13,274 --> 00:03:15,526
Hey, Duke!

45
00:03:16,611 --> 00:03:18,654
l'm sorry.

46
00:03:20,031 --> 00:03:23,617
Sure l understand.
We'll do it next year.

47
00:03:23,784 --> 00:03:27,371
We got too many good times
to let this tradition die.

48
00:03:27,538 --> 00:03:31,542
Yeah. Yeah, l love ya, ya big lug.

49
00:03:33,127 --> 00:03:35,880
OK, bye.

50
00:03:37,465 --> 00:03:41,427
- Your trip's been cancelled?
- Duke's back's out again.

51
00:03:41,594 --> 00:03:45,222
What a shame.
You were so looking forward to it.

52
00:03:45,389 --> 00:03:49,727
l still have the cabin,
but l can't go alone.

53
00:03:52,688 --> 00:03:58,402
As much as l'd like to do something
with you, ice fishing just isn't it.

54
00:03:59,611 --> 00:04:04,867
l know! They're doing a revival of
''The lceman Cometh'' downtown.

55
00:04:05,951 --> 00:04:10,414
We could catch a matinee, go out
for sushi and stay in the same theme.

56
00:04:11,498 --> 00:04:13,667
Thanks anyway.

57
00:04:13,834 --> 00:04:18,213
l used to enjoy waiting
for the men to return with their catch.

58
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:24,803
My brothers' friends would come back,
their chiselled faces all ruddy.

59
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:29,474
They were so masculine!
l couldn't wait to panfry their kippers.

60
00:04:30,684 --> 00:04:32,728
l'll go ice fishing, Dad.

61
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:38,483
- Really?
- Unless you don't want me to.

62
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:40,694
No, this will be great!

63
00:04:40,861 --> 00:04:42,904
- You? lce fishing?
- Why not?

64
00:04:43,071 --> 00:04:46,199
l see myself
as a man of the great alfresco.

65
00:04:47,409 --> 00:04:50,871
You get a runny nose
watching figure skating on TV.

66
00:04:52,122 --> 00:04:56,918
- Thanks, Niles.
- Anything to save your trip for you.

67
00:04:57,085 --> 00:04:59,754
Quite a gesture, but ice fishing?

68
00:04:59,921 --> 00:05:04,926
ln an Arctic tundra where large men
spit and it freezes in their beards?

69
00:05:05,093 --> 00:05:08,972
After you've seen Maris's dance group
performing in the garden,

70
00:05:09,139 --> 00:05:11,683
the wilderness holds no terror.

71
00:05:17,188 --> 00:05:20,442
- Morning.
- Good morning. Lovely day, isn't it?

72
00:05:20,608 --> 00:05:22,819
You're in a good mood.

73
00:05:22,986 --> 00:05:27,240
With your father gone,
it'll be a wonderful weekend.

74
00:05:27,407 --> 00:05:30,034
Care to make it perfect?

75
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:39,043
Sorry to disappoint you,
but l am staying.

76
00:05:40,795 --> 00:05:44,215
l found the Thermos!
Make that coffee extra strong!

77
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,343
How you doing?

78
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:52,640
l know you wanna go with me
but it will be too cold for you.

79
00:05:52,807 --> 00:05:55,935
Yeah, l love ya, ya little mutt.

80
00:05:57,895 --> 00:06:00,523
l'd better make sure l have everything.

81
00:06:04,527 --> 00:06:07,780
Did he just say,
''l love you'' to the dog?

82
00:06:07,947 --> 00:06:12,618
My aunt used to say, ''Good night,
Mr Van der Pump'' to a hat rack.

83
00:06:16,539 --> 00:06:18,916
Does he say that to Eddie a lot?

84
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:21,752
l try to give them their privacy.

85
00:06:23,754 --> 00:06:26,090
Sorry, l'm just curious.

86
00:06:26,257 --> 00:06:28,384
l don't want to sound maudlin,

87
00:06:28,551 --> 00:06:31,846
but l can't remember Dad
ever saying that to me.

88
00:06:32,013 --> 00:06:34,765
You know he's a crusty old git.

89
00:06:34,932 --> 00:06:39,186
Yes, but he says it to Eddie
and he said it to Duke on the phone.

90
00:06:39,353 --> 00:06:42,648
Duke and your father go way back.
He's his chum.

91
00:06:42,815 --> 00:06:45,568
And l'm not?

92
00:06:45,734 --> 00:06:49,822
When your dad wants to go fishing,
at least you could go with him.

93
00:06:50,865 --> 00:06:55,369
You're suggesting
that l pretend that l'm enjoying myself

94
00:06:55,536 --> 00:06:58,038
just to hear the words ''l love you''?

95
00:06:58,205 --> 00:07:01,375
Women have been doing it
for centuries.

96
00:07:03,877 --> 00:07:05,963
(Doorbell)

97
00:07:15,931 --> 00:07:18,267
Call me lshmael.

98
00:07:20,978 --> 00:07:25,524
Look at you! Are you sure
you're gonna be warm enough?

99
00:07:25,691 --> 00:07:29,319
l dressed in layers.
Polo, Eddie Bauer and Timberland.

100
00:07:30,529 --> 00:07:33,532
You look like a skinny Elmer Fudd.

101
00:07:36,076 --> 00:07:38,954
Wait till you see the stuff l got!

102
00:07:39,121 --> 00:07:43,917
l had no idea l liked fishing
till l realised all the shopping involved.

103
00:07:44,084 --> 00:07:46,420
Graphite poles...

104
00:07:46,586 --> 00:07:49,631
and...Hot Buns.

105
00:07:50,966 --> 00:07:55,804
You microwave them
and they stay toasty warm for hours.

106
00:07:55,971 --> 00:07:58,515
Dad, maybe l was a little hasty...

107
00:07:58,682 --> 00:08:01,059
Here we are.
Some snacks for the trip.

108
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:04,813
Look at you in your new togs!

109
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:07,816
The fish will see him coming.

110
00:08:07,983 --> 00:08:10,360
The salesmen certainly did.

111
00:08:12,821 --> 00:08:16,283
Dad, l feel bad that l turned you down.

112
00:08:16,449 --> 00:08:20,453
- Don't worry about it.
- Taste this smoked turkey jerky.

113
00:08:22,789 --> 00:08:26,042
Why don't you just ask him?

114
00:08:26,209 --> 00:08:29,129
How can l? l said l didn't want to go.

115
00:08:29,295 --> 00:08:31,339
- Delicious!
- Don't...

116
00:08:31,506 --> 00:08:34,801
- Come on, it's getting late.
- Let's hit the road.

117
00:08:34,968 --> 00:08:37,720
Are you sure you're up to the drive?

118
00:08:39,264 --> 00:08:42,976
l'm getting some mixed signals.
Do you want to go with us?

119
00:08:43,142 --> 00:08:48,064
All right! Better than hearing you
nag all the time! Fine! l'll go!

120
00:08:56,781 --> 00:08:58,825
(Wind howls)

121
00:09:01,244 --> 00:09:03,287
Well, this is...

122
00:09:04,372 --> 00:09:09,418
The ice isn't gonna break. This lake
has been frozen for three months.

123
00:09:11,129 --> 00:09:13,172
l'm sorry, Dad.

124
00:09:13,339 --> 00:09:19,178
When you said a cabin on the lake,
this is not what l had in mind.

125
00:09:19,345 --> 00:09:21,389
lt's a cabin, it's on the lake.

126
00:09:21,556 --> 00:09:24,350
lf it gets warmer, it'll be in the lake.

127
00:09:27,311 --> 00:09:31,607
That was amazing!
l've never felt so in touch with nature!

128
00:09:31,774 --> 00:09:35,695
For the first time in my life,
l just urinated outdoors!

129
00:09:40,282 --> 00:09:44,328
Another cup of coffee,
l'll go back and dot the ''i''.

130
00:09:44,495 --> 00:09:47,957
Dad, this is great!

131
00:09:48,124 --> 00:09:51,418
- Frasier doesn't think so.
- l'm not complaining.

132
00:09:51,585 --> 00:09:58,300
lt's just that l thought it would be
something more...lake-adjacent.

133
00:10:00,427 --> 00:10:03,138
We're actually going to sleep in here?

134
00:10:03,305 --> 00:10:05,516
Who is this rube?

135
00:10:07,393 --> 00:10:11,397
Maybe we can trick him into touching
his tongue to the bait bucket!

136
00:10:13,482 --> 00:10:15,984
No, we're sleeping someplace else.

137
00:10:16,151 --> 00:10:20,364
Just off the highway
is the Bed and Bass Motel.

138
00:10:20,531 --> 00:10:25,244
Bed and Bass.
One of the finer fish-themed hotels.

139
00:10:27,121 --> 00:10:29,164
So what do we do?

140
00:10:30,249 --> 00:10:34,336
We make a hole in the ice
with this thing and start fishing?

141
00:10:34,503 --> 00:10:36,547
lt's called an auger.

142
00:10:36,713 --> 00:10:39,508
Well, imagine my embarrassment.

143
00:10:40,968 --> 00:10:43,345
- Here's your Hot Buns, Dad.
- Thanks.

144
00:10:44,262 --> 00:10:47,891
- What am l gonna sit on?
- The auger's free.

145
00:10:48,809 --> 00:10:50,936
All right, come on. Here.

146
00:11:06,827 --> 00:11:08,870
l saw that.

147
00:11:10,664 --> 00:11:15,919
l am simply wondering how long we've
been sitting here enjoying ourselves.

148
00:11:17,504 --> 00:11:22,133
lf the fish aren't peckish,
we'll pass the time in good conversation.

149
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:27,055
This lake was formed by the retreat
of glaciers in the Cenozoic era.

150
00:11:27,222 --> 00:11:31,684
Which was the last time
anyone caught a fish in it.

151
00:11:33,853 --> 00:11:35,897
How do you know that, Niles?

152
00:11:36,064 --> 00:11:40,902
l read it in ''Fielding's Geological
History of Western Canada''.

153
00:11:41,069 --> 00:11:46,783
This very lake is 89 metres deep
and boasts 50 varieties of fish!

154
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:49,911
Oh, Alex,
l'll take bodies of water for 500.

155
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:57,669
lt has lake trout,
rainbow trout, walleyed pike...

156
00:11:57,835 --> 00:12:00,463
How would you like to sleep with them?

157
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:04,175
You could learn a thing or two
about getting into the spirit of things.

158
00:12:04,342 --> 00:12:08,846
l'm hungry and tired of trying
to warm up one bun at a time...

159
00:12:09,013 --> 00:12:11,057
in 20-degree weather!

160
00:12:11,224 --> 00:12:13,935
That's negative six degrees Celsius,

161
00:12:14,102 --> 00:12:17,438
a system named after
the Swedish astronomer

162
00:12:17,605 --> 00:12:20,107
and compulsive temperature taker!

163
00:12:21,943 --> 00:12:23,986
Niles, switch!

164
00:12:29,075 --> 00:12:31,577
- You're on my side.
- l am not.

165
00:12:31,744 --> 00:12:36,707
- You've crossed the border.
- l don't know why l'm here!

166
00:12:36,874 --> 00:12:39,877
Why don't you just
head back to the Bed and Bass?

167
00:12:40,044 --> 00:12:44,799
Just what l need -
a five-mile hike in freezing weather!

168
00:12:44,965 --> 00:12:47,968
- Take the car and pick us up later.
- Fine.

169
00:12:48,135 --> 00:12:51,138
- There's a hole in my pocket!
- You lost the keys?

170
00:12:51,305 --> 00:12:54,266
- Where?
- lf l knew, they wouldn't be lost!

171
00:12:54,433 --> 00:12:58,687
- Between here and the car.
- And it's been snowing all day.

172
00:12:58,854 --> 00:13:01,774
Great. We'll have to stay here all night!

173
00:13:01,941 --> 00:13:06,070
By morning,
we'll be frozen entrees for wolves!

174
00:13:06,237 --> 00:13:08,447
Wait! ls that them over there?

175
00:13:09,615 --> 00:13:13,118
- Thank God!
- Give me those right now.

176
00:13:13,285 --> 00:13:15,621
Fine, Mr Big Brother.

177
00:13:18,415 --> 00:13:21,543
- Nice catch.
- Me? You throw like a girl!

178
00:13:22,711 --> 00:13:29,051
Don't panic. We'll be fine here.
This happened to me and Duke.

179
00:13:29,218 --> 00:13:33,680
- You dropped your car keys?
- We're not idiots. The battery died.

180
00:13:33,847 --> 00:13:35,891
The three of us were just fine.

181
00:13:36,058 --> 00:13:40,729
- You, Duke and who?
- My drinking buddy, Mr James Beam.

182
00:13:40,896 --> 00:13:44,066
l got some fishing supplies, too.

183
00:13:44,233 --> 00:13:48,445
l never thought l'd end up
yearning for the Bed and Bass.

184
00:13:51,823 --> 00:13:54,326
- Niles?
- Yes, please.

185
00:13:59,664 --> 00:14:02,084
(Cracking)

186
00:14:06,797 --> 00:14:08,840
My God, what was that?

187
00:14:09,007 --> 00:14:11,802
Just the ice cracking underneath us.

188
00:14:13,178 --> 00:14:15,514
Relax. lt happens all the time.

189
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:21,353
lf we do fall in, we'll have 90 seconds
until hypothermia sets in.

190
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,439
One more fact, you're going in that hole!

191
00:14:25,148 --> 00:14:28,401
- The walleyed pike...
- That's enough!

192
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:32,322
Will you guys stop
going after each other?

193
00:14:32,489 --> 00:14:35,450
We're gonna lighten things up.

194
00:14:35,617 --> 00:14:38,536
We're drinking.
We need a drinking song.

195
00:14:40,622 --> 00:14:45,418
There is a great drinking song
from ''La Traviata''. ''Libiamo Brindisi''.

196
00:14:45,585 --> 00:14:49,088
- That's from ''Rigoletto''.
- lt's from ''La Traviata''.

197
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:51,382
(Singing ''Libiamo Brindisi'')

198
00:15:07,857 --> 00:15:10,276
That was great!

199
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:14,364
- What's the second verse?
- l don't know. lt's in ltalian!

200
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:19,327
- Another drink?
- No, l'll pass on that.

201
00:15:19,494 --> 00:15:21,537
l gotta go use the facilities.

202
00:15:21,704 --> 00:15:25,625
But l'll be right back. So keep
a light on in the window for me.

203
00:15:27,793 --> 00:15:30,379
l'm still thirsty, Niles. Beam me up!

204
00:15:40,473 --> 00:15:43,225
Can l ask you a personal question?

205
00:15:43,392 --> 00:15:46,520
- What the hell are you doing here?
- What?

206
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:49,940
This Sergeant-Niles-of-the-Yukon act.

207
00:15:50,107 --> 00:15:53,819
- lt can't be all to impress Daphne.
- lt's not an act.

208
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:56,864
l've never heard you comment on fish,

209
00:15:57,031 --> 00:16:00,159
except to say that
the sauce had separated.

210
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:04,330
All right, l'll tell you.
You promise not to laugh?

211
00:16:04,497 --> 00:16:07,750
You'll have to take that hat off.

212
00:16:11,212 --> 00:16:15,341
When you took Dad in l thought
l was getting away with something.

213
00:16:15,507 --> 00:16:21,055
But watching you two get closer,
l thought maybe l was missing out.

214
00:16:21,221 --> 00:16:23,265
You want him?

215
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:26,727
No, let me finish.

216
00:16:30,314 --> 00:16:33,233
l just feel the need
to make a connection.

217
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:37,946
You've made a connection.
lt just seems a bit extreme.

218
00:16:38,113 --> 00:16:42,493
You could've just taken him
to Captain Andy's Surf and Turf.

219
00:16:42,659 --> 00:16:46,205
And miss out on the fun
of memorising useless fish facts

220
00:16:46,371 --> 00:16:50,083
and buying a battery-operated
wardrobe?

221
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:52,836
So you're having
just as bad a time as l am?

222
00:16:53,003 --> 00:16:54,838
Worse.

223
00:16:55,922 --> 00:16:59,676
You have the fun of complaining.
l have to feign enthusiasm.

224
00:17:03,305 --> 00:17:07,100
l really am king of the ninnies, aren't l?

225
00:17:07,267 --> 00:17:10,061
Don't be reaching for that sceptre yet.

226
00:17:11,313 --> 00:17:13,732
Wanna know the reason
l came up here?

227
00:17:15,108 --> 00:17:18,445
Just to hear him
say the words ''l love you''.

228
00:17:18,612 --> 00:17:20,989
What?

229
00:17:21,156 --> 00:17:25,785
He said it to Duke, he said it to Eddie.
He's never said to me.

230
00:17:25,952 --> 00:17:29,205
Surely you don't put yourself
up there with Eddie.

231
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:37,255
You know he loves you.

232
00:17:37,422 --> 00:17:40,633
Of course. l am being ridiculous.
Look at the guy.

233
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:47,098
He's content to sit here freezing his
buns off because we're here with him.

234
00:17:47,265 --> 00:17:50,685
l just got a little obsessed
about hearing it.

235
00:17:50,852 --> 00:17:54,856
You know that Maris loves you,
but it's still nice to hear it.

236
00:17:55,023 --> 00:17:58,860
l imagine it would be,
but let's stick to attainable goals.

237
00:18:02,447 --> 00:18:05,950
As they laughed
the laugh of the damned.

238
00:18:09,287 --> 00:18:12,498
l did it! l wrote my name!

239
00:18:12,665 --> 00:18:16,210
l had to borrow an ''n'' from Niles,
but l did it!

240
00:18:16,377 --> 00:18:19,797
You're leaving quite
a urological crossword puzzle.

241
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,635
So what were you guys laughing at?

242
00:18:24,802 --> 00:18:28,598
- Oh, nothing.
- Don't leave your old man out.

243
00:18:30,349 --> 00:18:32,727
All right.

244
00:18:32,894 --> 00:18:38,774
l was explaining to Niles the reason
l drove all this way up here was...

245
00:18:38,941 --> 00:18:42,153
l was hoping to hear you say,
''l love you.''

246
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:46,574
l leave you for two minutes,
and you have to start thinking!

247
00:18:47,575 --> 00:18:50,328
lsn't it enough
that we're having a good time?

248
00:18:50,494 --> 00:18:51,912
Dad...

249
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:56,834
Thousands of guys go fishing
and love never enters into it.

250
00:18:58,669 --> 00:19:01,505
- Can we just go on fishing?
- Sure.

251
00:19:01,672 --> 00:19:06,510
A fisherman in Wisconsin
stared into a hole for 20 years

252
00:19:06,677 --> 00:19:09,471
before he caught his first fish.

253
00:19:09,638 --> 00:19:12,725
Haven't we been here that long?

254
00:19:12,892 --> 00:19:16,937
Just because l didn't say it,
doesn't mean l don't feel it.

255
00:19:17,104 --> 00:19:19,523
That's exactly what we were saying.

256
00:19:20,941 --> 00:19:23,611
My dad never said it,
but l know he felt it.

257
00:19:23,777 --> 00:19:26,947
Feeling it is the same as saying it.

258
00:19:27,114 --> 00:19:30,826
- You don't have to say it.
- Did it ever occur to you that...

259
00:19:33,287 --> 00:19:35,414
maybe l wanna say it?

260
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:42,045
Your mother used to get all over me
about not saying stuff, too.

261
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:49,428
l can't say it if you're looking at me.

262
00:19:54,808 --> 00:19:57,352
Would it help you if we left?

263
00:20:00,022 --> 00:20:02,941
Just for that l'm doing you second.

264
00:20:04,901 --> 00:20:07,654
l don't know why it's so hard.

265
00:20:07,821 --> 00:20:10,866
You can say it. You said it to Duke.

266
00:20:11,033 --> 00:20:15,328
That's different. l said, ''l love ya.'' Ya!

267
00:20:17,289 --> 00:20:19,332
We'd take ''ya''!

268
00:20:19,499 --> 00:20:21,334
Yeah.

269
00:20:21,501 --> 00:20:24,629
lf l'm gonna do it, l'll do it right.

270
00:20:28,341 --> 00:20:30,719
Frasier...

271
00:20:41,604 --> 00:20:43,982
Frasier...

272
00:20:46,776 --> 00:20:48,820
l love you.

273
00:20:50,488 --> 00:20:52,574
Niles...

274
00:20:53,366 --> 00:20:55,410
l love you.

275
00:20:57,078 --> 00:20:59,831
Thanks, Dad.

276
00:20:59,998 --> 00:21:02,375
l love you, too.

277
00:21:02,542 --> 00:21:04,669
And l love you, too.

278
00:21:06,504 --> 00:21:09,299
But l hate ice fishing!

279
00:21:12,719 --> 00:21:15,305
lt's the last time you'll have to do that.

280
00:21:15,471 --> 00:21:18,558
ln that case, l really love you.

281
00:21:18,725 --> 00:21:21,310
- Thanks.
- Look, that's so cute!

282
00:21:21,477 --> 00:21:24,772
When you say it to him, he blushes.
l love you.

283
00:21:24,939 --> 00:21:27,692
- Cut it out!
- l love you.

284
00:21:27,859 --> 00:21:30,945
- Now, come on! Stop it!
- Give us a kiss.

285
00:21:32,864 --> 00:21:36,033
- Excuse me.
- Hey, Officer!

286
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:40,079
- You have to come off the ice.
- We've lost the car keys.

287
00:21:40,246 --> 00:21:43,624
l'll take you to a motel
and you can call a locksmith.

288
00:21:43,791 --> 00:21:47,545
- Wonderful idea.
- Thank you. We love you.

289
00:21:48,879 --> 00:21:52,300
Ya. We love ya.

290
00:21:52,466 --> 00:21:55,219
We've been drinking a little.

291
00:22:01,017 --> 00:22:05,855
# Baby, l hear the blues are calling
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

292
00:22:06,021 --> 00:22:07,982
# Oh, my!

293
00:22:08,149 --> 00:22:14,989
# And maybe l seem a bit confused
Yeah, maybe...but l got you pegged!

294
00:22:15,156 --> 00:22:21,787
# But l don't know what to do with those
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

295
00:22:21,954 --> 00:22:24,248
# They're calling again

296
00:22:24,415 --> 00:22:27,501
# Scrambled egg's all over my face!

297
00:22:27,668 --> 00:22:31,630
# What is a boy to do? #

298
00:22:31,797 --> 00:22:34,967
Thank you!
