1
00:00:09,208 --> 00:00:11,833
(Woman) 'lt's not that l don't like him.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,917
'But he's gotten so attached.

3
00:00:15,083 --> 00:00:18,208
'l mean, roses every day
after two dates! '

4
00:00:18,375 --> 00:00:20,833
Maggie, first thing you have to do

5
00:00:21,042 --> 00:00:24,875
is sit Gavin down
for a nice long conversation.

6
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:30,250
Tell him frankly that,
though he wants to go at one speed,

7
00:00:30,458 --> 00:00:33,083
you need to go at another.

8
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:38,125
Tell him you're not rejecting him,
you are fond of him, but...

9
00:00:38,292 --> 00:00:44,417
l wonder what Roz, my non-PhD-holding
producer, thinks you should do.

10
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:50,750
Any guy who's that clingy after two
dates has a major insecurity problem.

11
00:00:50,917 --> 00:00:54,042
l say, ''Dump him. Now.
And don't look back.''

12
00:00:54,333 --> 00:00:57,375
(Maggie )
'lt's so good to hear that, Roz.

13
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:03,292
'That's what l wanted to do, but l felt
so guilty. Thanks so much. Bye.'

14
00:01:05,458 --> 00:01:07,500
That takes us to a commercial.

15
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:12,625
This, for those who have forgotten,
is the Dr Frasier Crane Show.

16
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:18,250
l confirmed your dinner reservation
for three.

17
00:01:18,417 --> 00:01:22,125
At your father's request,
that's at Chez Shrimp.

18
00:01:22,292 --> 00:01:27,625
Two letters to sign - a card for
Clarence, the guard, we're all signing,

19
00:01:27,792 --> 00:01:32,833
and a notice on the KACL bowling team
that l'll file in the trash.

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,333
Oh, wonderful. Another card.

21
00:01:35,458 --> 00:01:38,875
l, as resident wit,
will have to be clever.

22
00:01:39,083 --> 00:01:43,833
At least l've got another KACL
birthday bash to look forward to.

23
00:01:44,042 --> 00:01:46,917
l can just taste that frozen cake now

24
00:01:47,083 --> 00:01:52,375
and hear wild applause as an adult
snuffs out a handful of tiny candles.

25
00:01:53,792 --> 00:01:57,500
- What are you grousing about?
- Oh, nothing.

26
00:01:57,958 --> 00:02:00,583
(Card plays tune )

27
00:02:02,667 --> 00:02:05,500
Yes, the pageantry never stops.

28
00:02:12,417 --> 00:02:14,458
(Martin) Mr Fancy Pants.

29
00:02:14,625 --> 00:02:18,583
- He's got to buy a German car.
- lt's not my fault we broke down.

30
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:22,583
lf you'd bought American,
they could fix it here.

31
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:27,375
l always buy American so you can go
to the nearest garage.

32
00:02:27,542 --> 00:02:30,750
l could break down alone
in the middle of Alaska!

33
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:33,542
A thought to raise all our spirits.

34
00:02:34,792 --> 00:02:40,167
This traffic is murder. We could walk,
but humidity may ruin my loafers.

35
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:42,417
Does calfskin pucker?

36
00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:45,125
Yes, that's why on humid farms,

37
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:49,083
the calf is the most made fun of
of all the animals.

38
00:02:51,792 --> 00:02:54,875
Don't be snide.
We'll be here for a while.

39
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:57,833
Let's try and make
pleasant conversation.

40
00:02:58,042 --> 00:03:01,750
We are a family.
lt shouldn't be that hard.

41
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:08,667
Have you been driving long?

42
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:11,750
- Not really.
- Got any good stories?

43
00:03:11,917 --> 00:03:14,750
Ever hear of a woman
having a baby in a cab?

44
00:03:14,917 --> 00:03:19,083
- lt's a classic.
- Why? Did that happen in this cab?

45
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,875
- lt's about to.
- You're pregnant?

46
00:03:22,042 --> 00:03:23,875
Yes. Ow!

47
00:03:24,042 --> 00:03:26,625
Don't panic.
lt may be false labour.

48
00:03:26,792 --> 00:03:30,292
My waters just broke.
l'm in a puddle of water.

49
00:03:30,417 --> 00:03:32,208
Calfskin!

50
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:39,250
- Closest hospital is First Methodist.
- We'll never make it. Pull over!

51
00:03:39,417 --> 00:03:42,292
- Try to park facing downhill.
- Niles!

52
00:03:42,417 --> 00:03:46,708
- l can't have my baby here.
- There's no need to be concerned.

53
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:50,417
We are trained medical professionals.
Niles, help her!

54
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:54,750
- Hurry!
- l know.

55
00:03:58,208 --> 00:04:02,917
The other door!
Oh, for goodness sake!

56
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:05,625
ls anybody there? Come in!

57
00:04:05,792 --> 00:04:09,708
lt's most important to breathe deeply.
Do as l do.

58
00:04:13,792 --> 00:04:18,333
- Do you feel faint or short of breath?
- Yes, both of those.

59
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:23,833
- (Man) 'Hello? Go ahead.'
- Yes, l'm calling from cab No 804.

60
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,250
This is an emergency.
Your driver just went into labour.

61
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:31,292
We're at the corner
of 1 4th and Sycamore.

62
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,417
- We need an ambulance now.
- (Man) 'OK.'

63
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:37,208
- lt hurts.
- lt's natural.

64
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:43,375
- No, you're squeezing my hand.
- l only did this once in medical school.

65
00:04:43,542 --> 00:04:48,708
l remember lots of blood and a lino
floor hurtling toward my forehead.

66
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:52,833
- You fainted?
- Switch places and see how you do!

67
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:56,292
Good God, Niles!
l'll do this!

68
00:04:58,292 --> 00:05:02,958
- The baby's really coming now!
- When he does come, l'll catch him.

69
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:05,792
Just continue with your breathing.

70
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:11,750
Don't feel guilty
for having a baby in a cab.

71
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:16,792
Nothing to be ashamed of. Many great
Americans have been born this way.

72
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:19,292
Cab Calloway comes to mind.

73
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:26,417
l'm a psychiatrist. l specialise
in the head, not the lower body.

74
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:28,667
lt's less messy that way.

75
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:34,208
Not that your lower portion is messy.
lt's beautiful. Not that l'm looking!

76
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:38,833
- ls the pain that bad?
- No, you're driving me crazy!

77
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:42,625
Move it out, come on!

78
00:05:43,542 --> 00:05:46,125
- You a doctor, too?
- No, a retired cop.

79
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:49,792
Well what took you so long?
lt's really hurting.

80
00:05:50,042 --> 00:05:52,667
Everything's going to be just fine.

81
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:57,458
l've delivered a few babies,
and some are older than you are now.

82
00:05:57,625 --> 00:06:02,458
Frasier will hold your hand,
Niles will look out for an ambulance

83
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:06,000
and l'll help your beautiful baby out.
OK?

84
00:06:06,167 --> 00:06:08,458
- OK.
- Are there any questions?

85
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:11,167
Should our meter still be running?

86
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:18,208
(Daphne ) Hello? Are you back yet?

87
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:32,292
Well, go on, turn your heads.

88
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:46,917
OK. So l guess
you've had some excitement tonight.

89
00:06:47,167 --> 00:06:49,208
No, l haven't!

90
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:57,167
Your father made it sound exciting
on the phone: delivering a baby in a taxi.

91
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:59,542
l see that not as excitement

92
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:03,500
but as my duty to use the skills
l honed in medical school.

93
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:08,083
Yes, Niles ran to a falafel stand
for a pot of hot water.

94
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
l can't get over the feeling of being
there when a person's life begins.

95
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:18,833
One minute, it's a blob inside some
lady, next minute, it's a person.

96
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,167
Blob - person.

97
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:26,833
The miracle of birth
summed up in one poetic phrase.

98
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:31,042
l bet you have fond memories
of your son's birth.

99
00:07:31,167 --> 00:07:33,208
Oh, yes, of course.

100
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:36,792
The first time l held him in my arms
as a newborn,

101
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:40,667
it was as if everything else
simply melted away.

102
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:46,583
There was just a father, a son
and the distant sound of Lilith saying,

103
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:51,708
''lf you come near me again, Frasier,
l'll drop you with a deer rifle!''

104
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:56,542
At least now fathers
see their sons being born.

105
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:59,000
ln my day, they stuck us
in the waiting room,

106
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:02,375
smoking and reading Life magazine.

107
00:08:02,542 --> 00:08:06,083
l remember what l was reading
when Niles was born.

108
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:09,125
lt was about Mickey Mantle.

109
00:08:09,292 --> 00:08:12,000
Talk about life
setting you up for a fall.

110
00:08:15,167 --> 00:08:17,875
- l'm turning in.
- Night, Dad.

111
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,500
l wonder what dreams l'll have
after this talk about childbearing.

112
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:26,042
Probably the one
where my mother says,

113
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:30,375
''Daphne, you're 50 and you've
never given me grandchildren.''

114
00:08:30,542 --> 00:08:35,417
So l say, ''That was my choice.
l was thinking of my career.''

115
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:38,208
''But did you ever think of me?''

116
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:42,667
''Mother, l don't want
to start this again. Just drop it!''

117
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:46,542
But will she drop it?
''Oh, shut up, Mother!''

118
00:08:49,792 --> 00:08:53,083
l wonder how many more people
she's got in there.

119
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:02,042
- Sherry, Niles?
- No, thank you.

120
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:06,250
- Something on your mind?
- Actually, yes.

121
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:12,667
For months, l've noticed my thoughts
drifting to the same subject -

122
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:16,333
will l ever be a father?
There are pros and cons.

123
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:21,542
But, watching that birth,
l realised it's something l really want.

124
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:23,708
l think.

125
00:09:24,917 --> 00:09:28,000
lt's natural to have
parental stirrings.

126
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:31,292
l wake up nights thinking about it.

127
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:33,708
- Have you talked to Maris?
- Not yet.

128
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:37,833
l like to know what l want
before Maris tells me.

129
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:44,167
l'm just not sure
l'm ready for fatherhood.

130
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:50,125
No one is ever sure. These days,
teenagers who want to become parents

131
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:55,542
are given a sack of flour to keep
for a week, as if it were a baby.

132
00:09:55,708 --> 00:10:00,250
- You're kidding?
- No. They hold it, they care for it.

133
00:10:00,417 --> 00:10:04,458
lt gives a good idea
of the responsibility of parenthood.

134
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:09,542
What could be better than hands-on
experience? Might be worth a try!

135
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:12,583
- l wasn't...
- Why not? Maris is away.

136
00:10:12,792 --> 00:10:17,750
l'm desperate to resolve the issue.
Where do you keep the flour?

137
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,792
ln the kitchen.

138
00:10:20,917 --> 00:10:23,625
The cabinet next to the sink.

139
00:10:23,792 --> 00:10:26,917
Yes, here it is. ''Extra-refined.''

140
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:31,458
lt's taking after its old man already.

141
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:35,500
No, that's the sugar.
We're going to do this right.

142
00:10:35,667 --> 00:10:37,750
Now, here is the flour.

143
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:44,375
''Bleached, 100% fat free, best
when kept in an airtight container.''

144
00:10:44,542 --> 00:10:47,458
This one's taking after its mother.

145
00:10:59,167 --> 00:11:02,833
Hello. May l join you?
Or should l say, ''May we?''

146
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:09,333
<i>Mais oui. So you're continuing
with our little baby experiment?</i>

147
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,917
Yes. And it's been
quite a learning experience.

148
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:16,083
Not easy, though!
l take him everywhere,

149
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:20,583
get up for 2:00 am feedings,
the whole exhausting nine yards.

150
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:23,417
What a beautiful baby!
How old is he?

151
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:26,875
- Eight weeks.
- Great age, isn't it?

152
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,792
Niles? l can't help noticing
that your child has a little boo-boo.

153
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:42,042
lt's nothing.
l was playing him some Brahms.

154
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:45,458
Never too early to ingrain them.

155
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:49,167
l must have begun conducting
with a chopstick

156
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:52,042
and l accidentally ran him through.

157
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:57,042
What young parent
doesn't tell that story?

158
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:04,625
The scuffs were the fault
of my new houseman, Ngee.

159
00:12:04,792 --> 00:12:07,083
- What did Ghee do?
- No, it's Ngee.

160
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,417
- Ghee.
- No, no. Ngee.

161
00:12:10,167 --> 00:12:13,042
Oh, who cares? What did he do?

162
00:12:13,667 --> 00:12:17,792
He'd just given my car a shine,
when l sat the baby on the roof

163
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:20,917
and down it went onto the driveway.

164
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:24,875
Would you watch him while l order?

165
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:30,000
(Roz) Hey, Frase. This seat taken?

166
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:33,083
Well, actually...
No.

167
00:12:36,792 --> 00:12:40,750
Clarence is doing better.
l just dropped his card off.

168
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:43,417
- Clarence?
- The guard.

169
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:47,417
Oh, down at the station.
Good. l didn't know he was sick.

170
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:50,708
You signed his ''get well'' card.

171
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:53,083
That wasn't a birthday card?

172
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:57,125
No, he's in hospital
having a kidney transplant.

173
00:12:57,292 --> 00:13:00,792
Oh, my God!
l thought it was his birthday.

174
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:05,083
l wrote, ''You're not getting older,
just closer to death.''

175
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:12,042
How could you think
it was his birthday?

176
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:17,792
l didn't recognise the traditional
card for a sick man - a giant bunny.

177
00:13:19,417 --> 00:13:22,625
- Has he read it yet?
- No, he was asleep.

178
00:13:22,792 --> 00:13:26,458
l'll look so callous.
We've got to get that card back!

179
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:30,792
How can you be leaving?
l asked you to baby-sit!

180
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:33,792
l have no time for your insanity!

181
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:37,667
l have to go steal a ''get well'' card
from a kidney patient.

182
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:43,667
(Daphne ) What does that say ''Geb...''?

183
00:13:43,792 --> 00:13:47,042
No, it's ''Get''.
''Get well soon. Love, Andrea.''

184
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:50,792
Just copy it down
and move on to the next name.

185
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,750
We have to transfer all the names
on to the new card.

186
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:57,042
l want to get it back tonight.

187
00:13:57,208 --> 00:14:00,875
So you snuck into his room
and stole his card?

188
00:14:01,042 --> 00:14:05,792
l did not sneak in. Luckily, he was
in extreme pain and heavily sedated.

189
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:09,750
You should have found out
who this Clarence was.

190
00:14:09,917 --> 00:14:12,417
You never pay attention
to the little people.

191
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:16,042
Yes, why don't we invite
the commoners

192
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:18,500
to drag me to the square
and stone me.

193
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,250
(Doorbell)

194
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:24,208
That must be Niles.
He's taking me to the hospital.

195
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:27,833
- Hello, Niles.
- Hello, Frasier.

196
00:14:40,292 --> 00:14:45,000
- What are you doing with that?
- Forging a parent-child bond.

197
00:14:45,167 --> 00:14:49,625
That's a relief. l was afraid
it might be something stupid.

198
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:56,417
l don't wear it in public. But l want
a true picture of parenthood.

199
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:58,958
- And?
- lt's driving me batty.

200
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:09,000
Feedings every two hours,
constantly monitoring where he is.

201
00:15:09,167 --> 00:15:11,333
You can get obsessed with worry.

202
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,750
Last night, l dreamt
my flour sack was abducted

203
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:19,458
and the kidnappers
started sending me muffins in the mail.

204
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:29,208
On the plus side, l've learnt a lot.

205
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:34,167
lf l ever go through the real thing,
l'll make a wonderful parent.

206
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:40,542
Niles, what has happened
to your child?

207
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:43,792
l was practising my t'ai chi

208
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:48,583
and l accidentally kicked him
into the reflecting pool.

209
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:53,583
Then l brought him inside
and left him by the hearth to dry.

210
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:57,667
He caught on fire?

211
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:01,833
lt was not that careless.

212
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,625
A real child would have cried
before it burst into flames.

213
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:13,083
(Alarm beeps)

214
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:15,292
Ah! Time for his nap!

215
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:21,708
- Turn him over if he starts fussing.
- No.

216
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:27,125
- l'm role-playing, Dad.
- Try the role of a sane person.

217
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:39,208
So, any closer to making
a decision about fatherhood?

218
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:43,917
No. One minute, l think
l could never stand the stress,

219
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:48,417
the next, l'm daydreaming
about taking my son to the museum

220
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:53,458
or listening to his first ''Für Elise''
and l swear there are tears in my eyes.

221
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:55,958
(Eddie growls)

222
00:17:01,667 --> 00:17:04,333
Oh, dear... Eddie!

223
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:09,042
(Australian accent)
That dingo's got your baby.

224
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:11,542
Oh, God! Eddie, Dad!

225
00:17:13,292 --> 00:17:16,500
Don't worry.
l'll clean up that mess.

226
00:17:16,667 --> 00:17:21,458
For God's sake, calm down! l think
it's time you realised something.

227
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:25,125
That is not a person.
lt's a bag of flour.

228
00:17:25,292 --> 00:17:27,583
lt's easy to tell the difference.

229
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:31,167
People don't have recipes
on their backs.

230
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:35,833
This is stupid!
We're talking about having a baby here.

231
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,458
You make that decision in your gut,
not intellectually.

232
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:43,125
What is your gut feeling?

233
00:17:43,292 --> 00:17:45,417
- l'm not sure.
- You'd better be.

234
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:48,542
Nothing can prepare you
for having a kid.

235
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:52,333
lt's hard. Full of surprises.

236
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:55,500
Maybe your kid
won't want piano lessons.

237
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:59,083
- He might like baseball.
- Don't even say that.

238
00:18:01,167 --> 00:18:05,083
Just trust yourself.
You'll know if it's right or not.

239
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:12,667
l'm finished, if you're ready
to take me to the hospital.

240
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:17,917
l wonder if this experiment
wasn't just a way of convincing myself

241
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:21,458
l'm ready for something,
when l know l'm not.

242
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:25,333
- What do you mean?
- l want to have a baby.

243
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:29,167
But l just don't want it enough.

244
00:18:31,667 --> 00:18:35,583
Oh... That's the hardest thing
l've ever had to admit.

245
00:18:35,792 --> 00:18:40,250
- Why do you say that?
- Because it's so selfish.

246
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:44,750
l'm the right age,
l have the money, the energy.

247
00:18:44,917 --> 00:18:48,375
lt's only selfish to have babies
for the wrong reasons.

248
00:18:48,542 --> 00:18:51,458
People should find out
if they're ready.

249
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:54,750
Anyway, feeling this way now

250
00:18:54,917 --> 00:18:58,792
doesn't mean things can't change
in a few years.

251
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:01,750
Perhaps you're right.

252
00:19:01,917 --> 00:19:04,625
Maris and l will be over 40 then.

253
00:19:04,792 --> 00:19:08,875
Maybe we should look into
getting some of her eggs frozen.

254
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:14,542
Oh, l suspect they're only
a few degrees away from that now.

255
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:21,042
Who is this Clarence fellow?

256
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:23,333
Some guy down at the station.

257
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:42,333
(Music plays)

258
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:52,292
Dr Crane! lt's Clarence!
Were you in there looking for me?

259
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:56,208
- As a matter of fact, l was.
- They changed my room.

260
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:58,542
This is so sweet of you.

261
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:03,417
Clarence is such a fixture, the
station isn't the same without him.

262
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:05,917
You find the time to come here

263
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:11,625
while the rest of those bums at
the station don't even send me a card.

264
00:20:11,792 --> 00:20:16,417
Actually, Clarence,
there's an explanation for that.

265
00:20:17,542 --> 00:20:19,583
(Patient) Make the music stop!

266
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:31,083
You see, the others at the station
don't know you the way l do.

267
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:34,000
Well, listen,
you get yourself well.

268
00:20:34,167 --> 00:20:38,083
l miss seeing you
every time l walk by the...

269
00:20:39,292 --> 00:20:41,583
...place you tend to be.

270
00:20:42,667 --> 00:20:45,125
Niles!

271
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,542
What are you doing?

272
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:54,792
Looking at these babies, wondering
if l made the right decision.

273
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:57,000
- Niles...
- Look at them!

274
00:20:57,208 --> 00:21:00,208
They're healthy, beautiful, lovable...

275
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:03,167
Flammable.

276
00:21:04,167 --> 00:21:08,333
Maybe l'm more ready
for parenthood than l thought.

277
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:13,500
- Hey, what are you guys doing here?
- Arleen! And this must be...

278
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:15,833
Yes, little Nathan.

279
00:21:17,917 --> 00:21:22,917
l'm so glad l ran into you.
We both want to thank you guys again.

280
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:25,458
Would one of you like to hold him?

281
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:29,125
Yes, l would.

282
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:35,208
Oh, he's beautiful.

283
00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:39,250
Yes, why shouldn't you cry?

284
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:42,375
Everything's so new to you...

285
00:21:42,542 --> 00:21:45,417
So much life to live...

286
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:49,042
- No, you've got his leg bent back.
- Oh, God!

287
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:51,875
l'm sorry.

288
00:21:52,042 --> 00:21:55,708
Well, see you, guys.
Say ''hi'' to your dad for me.

289
00:21:56,583 --> 00:22:01,375
- Perhaps l made the right decision.
- l'd say so. Ready to go?

290
00:22:08,167 --> 00:22:09,542
(Baby murmurs)

291
00:22:13,292 --> 00:22:18,958
# Hey baby, l hear the blues are calling
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

292
00:22:19,125 --> 00:22:20,458
# Mercy!

293
00:22:20,625 --> 00:22:27,167
# And maybe l seem a bit confused
Well, maybe, but l got you pegged

294
00:22:27,333 --> 00:22:32,958
# But l don't know what to do with those
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

295
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:36,208
# They're calling again #

296
00:22:36,417 --> 00:22:39,042
Good night!
