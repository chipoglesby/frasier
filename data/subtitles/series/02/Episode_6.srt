1
00:00:16,006 --> 00:00:18,050
Allow me.

2
00:00:18,926 --> 00:00:21,303
You're welcome.

3
00:00:25,266 --> 00:00:28,102
When did everyone become so boorish?

4
00:00:28,268 --> 00:00:32,856
Sometimes, l think l'm the only
person with any sense of refinement.

5
00:00:33,023 --> 00:00:35,150
Oh, smell my hands.

6
00:00:37,027 --> 00:00:39,071
Thank you, no.

7
00:00:39,238 --> 00:00:43,367
l'm so proud. l had to stop for gas,
and l pumped it myself.

8
00:00:45,619 --> 00:00:48,163
- lt's part of a new kick l'm on.
- What?

9
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:50,833
l'm learning to be handy.

10
00:00:50,999 --> 00:00:54,586
l depend too much on others,
so l'm doing it myself.

11
00:00:54,753 --> 00:00:59,383
Feel that.
Surely the start of a first-rate callus.

12
00:00:59,549 --> 00:01:02,761
- You left this in your booth.
- Thank you.

13
00:01:02,928 --> 00:01:06,014
- What is it?
- A tape l rented for Dad.

14
00:01:06,181 --> 00:01:08,225
lt's our new Wednesday ritual.

15
00:01:08,392 --> 00:01:14,022
Dad makes chilli, we watch an Angie
Dickinson movie and l wish l was dead.

16
00:01:15,524 --> 00:01:19,611
- You should join us.
- No, l got my first work shirt today

17
00:01:19,778 --> 00:01:24,032
and tonight, l'm tackling
the squeaky hasp on my cigar humidor.

18
00:01:24,199 --> 00:01:27,160
Be sure to wear your hernia belt.

19
00:01:27,327 --> 00:01:29,579
Roz, will you join us?

20
00:01:29,746 --> 00:01:32,832
No, l'll just go sit over here.

21
00:01:32,999 --> 00:01:35,335
Are you trying to avoid me?

22
00:01:35,502 --> 00:01:39,089
Yes. You took a year to learn my name.

23
00:01:39,256 --> 00:01:43,134
- You always make snide remarks.
- Name one.

24
00:01:43,301 --> 00:01:48,223
You told me my bedroom was easier
to get into than a community college.

25
00:01:50,266 --> 00:01:52,811
l was hoping you'd name that one.

26
00:01:52,977 --> 00:01:55,021
l've got half a mind to...

27
00:01:55,188 --> 00:01:58,817
Just hold on!
You got off on the wrong foot.

28
00:01:59,025 --> 00:02:03,446
lf you two had a real conversation,
you'd hit it off famously.

29
00:02:03,613 --> 00:02:07,033
You sit and l will go
and get your coffee.

30
00:02:10,453 --> 00:02:13,915
So, how are you?

31
00:02:14,082 --> 00:02:16,376
- Fine. You?
- Great.

32
00:02:17,543 --> 00:02:19,629
l'm handy now.

33
00:02:25,551 --> 00:02:28,137
So...that's a nice jacket.

34
00:02:28,304 --> 00:02:31,516
- Thank you.
- lt's offbeat.

35
00:02:32,392 --> 00:02:34,936
What does that mean? ''Offbeat''?

36
00:02:35,103 --> 00:02:39,774
- Well...
- l know. Offbeat as in cheap.

37
00:02:39,941 --> 00:02:43,736
l'm not rich enough to shop at
the lnternational House of Tight Ass

38
00:02:43,903 --> 00:02:45,905
like you and Maris the Heiress.

39
00:02:47,323 --> 00:02:51,911
- That is what you meant, right?
- Yes, but l didn't think you'd get it.

40
00:02:53,287 --> 00:02:57,875
- Then you were insulting me.
- You got in some good shots, too.

41
00:02:58,042 --> 00:03:01,003
l did, didn't l?

42
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:03,964
l'm so glad we did this!

43
00:03:05,049 --> 00:03:08,260
Sometimes l'm such a good therapist,
l scare myself.

44
00:03:12,014 --> 00:03:15,476
- Where's my briefcase?
- lsn't it under your chair?

45
00:03:15,643 --> 00:03:18,229
Someone must have taken it!

46
00:03:18,395 --> 00:03:20,773
Frasier, look, there it is!

47
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,278
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

48
00:03:26,445 --> 00:03:29,031
- ls that your briefcase?
- Yes.

49
00:03:29,198 --> 00:03:33,911
- Where did you get it?
- Some nuns in my parish gave it to me.

50
00:03:35,371 --> 00:03:37,998
Then that would make you a priest.

51
00:03:38,165 --> 00:03:39,833
Yes.

52
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,547
Then, Father, perhaps you'd like to
explain why you'd be carrying around...

53
00:03:45,714 --> 00:03:48,342
...a Bible and some rosary beads!

54
00:03:50,385 --> 00:03:53,263
- What are you looking for?
- A movie.

55
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:56,391
l loaned it to the monsignor
to give to you.

56
00:03:56,558 --> 00:04:01,021
Apparently he forgot.
lt's a two-day rental. lt doesn't matter.

57
00:04:01,897 --> 00:04:06,193
Sorry. lt looked like yours.
They have the same inferior leather.

58
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:09,571
- l gave him that briefcase.
- l know.

59
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:18,497
Yes, l would mind holding.
l've already held three times.

60
00:04:18,663 --> 00:04:22,876
l'm trying to report stolen credit cards
but every five seconds...

61
00:04:23,043 --> 00:04:25,045
Damn it!

62
00:04:27,464 --> 00:04:29,966
Don't stare at me. l'm a humane man,

63
00:04:30,133 --> 00:04:34,387
but right now, l could kick a kitten
through an electric fan.

64
00:04:36,848 --> 00:04:41,811
Hey, Frase. Niles called.
Somebody stole your briefcase?

65
00:04:41,978 --> 00:04:46,066
Go ahead, tell me how stupid l was
to get taken advantage of.

66
00:04:46,232 --> 00:04:51,404
Better than listening to ''Jumping
Jack Flash'' for piano and flute.

67
00:04:51,571 --> 00:04:57,202
You weren't stupid. These guys are
pros. They need a second, and bam!

68
00:04:57,369 --> 00:05:00,121
That's rather refreshing.

69
00:05:00,288 --> 00:05:03,249
l thought you'd call me
a naive dupe or...

70
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:06,127
- A bone-headed rube?
- But you're not.

71
00:05:06,294 --> 00:05:10,965
No. You learned a lesson.
You gotta keep your guard up.

72
00:05:11,132 --> 00:05:18,264
This world would be a happier place if
everybody remembered people stink.

73
00:05:18,431 --> 00:05:25,396
That's a little cynical for me. l prefer
to think of people as basically good.

74
00:05:25,563 --> 00:05:31,069
Yes, l am here, but l'm in the middle
of a speech so you'll have to hold!

75
00:05:34,614 --> 00:05:37,700
l enjoy my life that way.

76
00:05:37,867 --> 00:05:42,246
lf the price l have to pay is to replace
a few credit cards, so be it.

77
00:05:42,413 --> 00:05:47,460
Reminds me of when l moved to
London. l didn't trust people back then.

78
00:05:47,627 --> 00:05:53,257
l tried to stay out of harm's way
by walking with my eyes cast down,

79
00:05:53,424 --> 00:05:55,718
never meeting anyone's glance.

80
00:05:55,885 --> 00:05:59,597
But l decided that was no way to live.

81
00:05:59,764 --> 00:06:03,851
So one day,
l lifted up my chin and took it all in.

82
00:06:04,018 --> 00:06:07,229
The change was amazing.

83
00:06:07,396 --> 00:06:11,692
There were sights l'd never seen,
sounds l'd never heard.

84
00:06:11,859 --> 00:06:16,405
A tiny old man came up to me with
a note in his hand. He needed help.

85
00:06:16,572 --> 00:06:22,786
This was no city full of thieves
and muggers. People needed me.

86
00:06:22,953 --> 00:06:29,668
l took his note, read it, and l still
remember what l said to him:

87
00:06:29,835 --> 00:06:33,380
''That's not how you spell fellatio.''

88
00:06:41,472 --> 00:06:44,808
So, whose point did she prove?

89
00:06:44,975 --> 00:06:47,644
l have no idea.

90
00:06:50,397 --> 00:06:55,360
lt's been fun chatting with you all,
nasty old Gertrude aside.

91
00:06:56,361 --> 00:06:59,406
l'd like to close
with a personal message.

92
00:06:59,573 --> 00:07:03,535
This goes out to the person
who stole my briefcase yesterday.

93
00:07:04,453 --> 00:07:09,333
And also stole my dry cleaning
with the claim ticket that was inside it.

94
00:07:11,627 --> 00:07:14,588
You need help,
and l am here to provide it.

95
00:07:14,755 --> 00:07:20,218
Also, the double-breasted navy blue
suit should be worn with French cuffs.

96
00:07:20,385 --> 00:07:24,431
You may be sick,
but you should be stylish.

97
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:28,185
Until tomorrow, this is Dr Frasier Crane.

98
00:07:29,561 --> 00:07:32,189
Man, that was a great show!

99
00:07:32,355 --> 00:07:35,817
lt was better than great!
lt was brilliant! You...

100
00:07:35,984 --> 00:07:38,528
What do you want?

101
00:07:38,695 --> 00:07:42,032
- Remember l said l need Friday off?
- No.

102
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:44,367
You don't remember
or l can't have Friday off?

103
00:07:44,534 --> 00:07:46,578
Take one of each. l'm feeling generous.

104
00:07:46,745 --> 00:07:48,580
(Phone rings)

105
00:07:49,456 --> 00:07:51,916
- Hello.
- (Man) 'Dr Crane?'

106
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:55,837
- Yes.
- 'Oh, man! l can't believe l got through! '

107
00:07:56,004 --> 00:07:59,257
My show is over.
Please call in again tomorrow.

108
00:07:59,424 --> 00:08:03,428
- 'l'm calling cos l found your briefcase. '
- Are you sure?

109
00:08:03,595 --> 00:08:05,805
- 'Pretty sure.'
- We can check.

110
00:08:05,972 --> 00:08:10,810
ln the upper right-hand corner,
there's a water mark

111
00:08:10,977 --> 00:08:15,231
left by the careless resting
of a champagne flute.

112
00:08:15,398 --> 00:08:19,319
- 'lt's full of your stuff, Dr Crane. '
- That works as well.

113
00:08:20,486 --> 00:08:25,199
- ls everything still there?
- 'A pen, a set of car keys, a date book. '

114
00:08:25,366 --> 00:08:27,452
- And my wallet?
- 'Sorry.'

115
00:08:27,619 --> 00:08:31,539
That was asking for too much.
How can l get it back?

116
00:08:31,706 --> 00:08:33,750
'l could drop it off.'

117
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:38,546
Meet me at the Café Nervosa on Pike.
l'd be glad to give you a reward.

118
00:08:38,713 --> 00:08:41,215
'Meeting you is reward enough.
Half an hour?'

119
00:08:41,382 --> 00:08:43,509
That's perfect. Bye.

120
00:08:44,719 --> 00:08:48,181
- That was great.
- But not surprising.

121
00:08:48,347 --> 00:08:53,269
- l told you to have faith in people.
- Yes. People are good. And fair.

122
00:08:53,436 --> 00:08:56,898
We do nice things for people
because of karma.

123
00:08:57,064 --> 00:09:00,276
- You're not getting Friday off.
- Why?

124
00:09:05,656 --> 00:09:07,783
Allow me.

125
00:09:11,829 --> 00:09:15,374
Can you believe that?
That's the second time this week!

126
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:18,461
- l want to say something.
- Why don't you?

127
00:09:19,462 --> 00:09:24,884
Something happens when l talk to a
beautiful woman. My knees turn to jelly.

128
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:29,472
You can only break people of
bad habits by confronting them.

129
00:09:29,638 --> 00:09:32,975
- That's true.
- So?

130
00:09:33,142 --> 00:09:35,227
- Who's next here?
- l am.

131
00:09:35,394 --> 00:09:37,980
No, you weren't next. l am!

132
00:09:40,608 --> 00:09:45,613
People like you who glide through life
in a cosy cocoon of narcissism

133
00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:47,823
never notice such things!

134
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:51,118
But learn this lesson, sister!

135
00:09:52,286 --> 00:09:55,164
There's still such a thing
as good manners.

136
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:58,709
That's why l insist you let me
buy you your coffee

137
00:09:58,876 --> 00:10:02,171
and please try the poppy seed muffins.

138
00:10:02,337 --> 00:10:04,631
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

139
00:10:12,306 --> 00:10:15,559
Kind of brutal, weren't you?

140
00:10:15,726 --> 00:10:20,480
l just remember ''l was next''
and the sound of blood in my ears.

141
00:10:20,647 --> 00:10:25,527
Soon you'll be home with Maris
and you'll forget about beautiful women.

142
00:10:27,446 --> 00:10:31,408
- Let's sit here so we can see him.
- Your Good Samaritan?

143
00:10:31,575 --> 00:10:35,454
Yes. l'm feeling rather good
about this whole thing.

144
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:40,083
l lost my wallet and my favourite suit
but other things were intact:

145
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:43,920
my date book, my spare car keys,
my fountain pen.

146
00:10:44,087 --> 00:10:46,548
But best of all, what remained intact

147
00:10:46,715 --> 00:10:50,218
is my sense that people
are basically trustworthy.

148
00:10:50,385 --> 00:10:56,391
He has your keys. He's meeting you
here knowing you'd bring your car?

149
00:10:56,558 --> 00:11:00,562
Before you launch into a paranoid riff,
my car is...

150
00:11:00,729 --> 00:11:03,690
moving down the street!

151
00:11:03,857 --> 00:11:07,235
Stop that well-dressed man!

152
00:11:10,655 --> 00:11:16,161
Charlie, it's Frasier's car. Could
you put some extra manpower on this?

153
00:11:16,327 --> 00:11:20,081
Yeah. l know. Fell for that old scam.

154
00:11:20,832 --> 00:11:24,919
l told him to keep his guard up,
but Frasier always knows better.

155
00:11:25,086 --> 00:11:27,881
Mr Up-With-People.

156
00:11:28,047 --> 00:11:32,594
Yeah. Remember what we used
to call guys like him on the force?

157
00:11:34,846 --> 00:11:38,391
Hey, we're still talking
about my son here!

158
00:11:38,558 --> 00:11:40,685
Yeah. l'll talk to you.

159
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:46,899
- Hi, Frasier. How's it going?
- Terribly! Guess what happened today.

160
00:11:47,066 --> 00:11:50,236
- What?
- My car was stolen!

161
00:11:51,112 --> 00:11:53,281
You're kidding.

162
00:11:53,448 --> 00:11:56,784
l fell victim to a master criminal.

163
00:11:56,951 --> 00:12:02,623
Did they hot-wire it? Boy, those guys
got fingers like concert pianists.

164
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:05,334
No. He had the key.

165
00:12:05,501 --> 00:12:11,257
A real pro. Made a wax impression
and then had a duplicate key made?

166
00:12:12,466 --> 00:12:14,510
No.

167
00:12:15,553 --> 00:12:19,265
lt was the same miscreant
that stole my briefcase.

168
00:12:19,432 --> 00:12:21,767
He used the spare set that was inside.

169
00:12:21,934 --> 00:12:26,313
He tailed you so he'd know
where to find the car?

170
00:12:28,983 --> 00:12:31,026
Not exactly.

171
00:12:32,445 --> 00:12:35,531
He called the station
and we agreed to meet.

172
00:12:35,698 --> 00:12:39,618
- What for?
- Low-fat lattes and biscotti.

173
00:12:44,707 --> 00:12:48,002
What are you, the town crier?

174
00:12:48,168 --> 00:12:52,464
lt doesn't shake my belief
in the basic goodness of people.

175
00:12:52,631 --> 00:12:57,219
Sure. He's probably using your car
to deliver hot meals to shut-ins.

176
00:13:01,432 --> 00:13:06,854
l'm glad my misfortune's given you so
much glee. Dad, l have two requests.

177
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:11,525
First, wipe that smirk off your face.
l'm not a child.

178
00:13:11,692 --> 00:13:14,570
What's the second request?

179
00:13:15,946 --> 00:13:19,825
Can l borrow your car?
l want to go to the movies.

180
00:13:26,248 --> 00:13:31,837
And last stop on our tour,
my booth, where all the magic happens.

181
00:13:32,004 --> 00:13:36,883
- Hey, what are you doing here?
- Dr Crane needed a lift so l came up.

182
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:39,886
Just go on about your business.

183
00:13:40,053 --> 00:13:42,597
lt's not like l'm listening.

184
00:13:43,974 --> 00:13:47,686
Have we had one visitor yet
who didn't do that?

185
00:13:47,853 --> 00:13:50,814
Thanks but we do have a show to do.

186
00:13:50,981 --> 00:13:55,235
- People say l have a talent for this.
- Yes, of course.

187
00:13:55,402 --> 00:13:59,489
Your soothing voice.
l could listen to you for hours.

188
00:13:59,656 --> 00:14:03,451
- Do you really think so?
- Yes. Absolutely. Now get out.

189
00:14:03,618 --> 00:14:05,328
(Phone rings)

190
00:14:05,495 --> 00:14:10,291
- Could you get that?
- Hello? Who's calling, please?

191
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:13,002
Just a second.

192
00:14:13,169 --> 00:14:15,839
Denise. She was out with you last night.

193
00:14:16,005 --> 00:14:20,635
- l wasn't out with anyone of that name.
- Ooh, speakerphone!

194
00:14:21,719 --> 00:14:23,680
All right.

195
00:14:23,847 --> 00:14:25,974
Hello. This is Frasier Crane.

196
00:14:26,141 --> 00:14:29,519
(Denise ) 'Hey, tiger. l miss you already. '

197
00:14:29,686 --> 00:14:31,855
l beg your pardon?

198
00:14:32,021 --> 00:14:36,609
'You just snuck out this morning
without giving me your number,

199
00:14:36,776 --> 00:14:41,406
'and l woke up to see
your BMW pulling down my driveway.'

200
00:14:41,572 --> 00:14:43,032
You did?

201
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:48,121
'l'm not mad. How can l be after my best
first night ever with a man? '

202
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:51,666
Denise, could you hold on
for a moment?

203
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:56,712
- Do you realise what this means?
- He told her he was you!

204
00:14:56,879 --> 00:14:59,048
And it worked!

205
00:14:59,215 --> 00:15:02,593
Nobody ever sleeps with me
on a first date!

206
00:15:04,929 --> 00:15:06,597
Hi.

207
00:15:06,764 --> 00:15:11,394
'Sorry but l won't be able to meet you
for that drink at Alberto's.

208
00:15:11,561 --> 00:15:15,356
'The agency called.
They booked me for a swimsuit layout.

209
00:15:15,523 --> 00:15:20,069
'There's my cab.
l'll call you tomorrow. Kisses.'

210
00:15:20,236 --> 00:15:22,613
Unbelievable!

211
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:26,867
He wasn't content to steal my
possessions. He wants my identity!

212
00:15:27,034 --> 00:15:31,205
- l'm calling the police.
- No! l am going to Alberto's!

213
00:15:31,372 --> 00:15:34,291
- You have a show!
- Run ''The Best of Dr Crane''.

214
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:37,753
This jackal will meet me, not Denise!

215
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:43,133
- He could be dangerous!
- l don't care! He's after my soul!

216
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:48,764
Shakespeare wrote, ''He who steals
my purse, steals trash. But he who...''

217
00:15:48,931 --> 00:15:52,601
Oh, l forget the rest,
but it makes me good and mad!

218
00:16:04,613 --> 00:16:09,326
Have you seen a man wearing
an impeccably tailored ltalian suit?

219
00:16:09,493 --> 00:16:14,289
- Just you.
- Oh, well. Thank you.

220
00:16:14,456 --> 00:16:18,085
- Giorgio Armani.
- lt's nice to meet you, Giorgio.

221
00:16:20,671 --> 00:16:24,299
- My name's Heather.
- Frasier Crane. Do you mind?

222
00:16:26,301 --> 00:16:30,264
Wait a minute.
Dr Frasier Crane, from the radio?

223
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:33,433
- Yes.
- l've heard your show. You're great.

224
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,229
- Thank you.
- This is exciting!

225
00:16:38,689 --> 00:16:43,860
Didn't you say that someone had
impersonated you at the dry cleaners?

226
00:16:44,027 --> 00:16:48,365
- Yes, someone did.
- You could be the impersonator.

227
00:16:48,532 --> 00:16:51,910
lf you're looking for identification, l...

228
00:16:52,994 --> 00:16:55,747
- l thought so.
- He stole my wallet.

229
00:16:55,914 --> 00:16:59,084
- Who did?
- Frasier did. The bad Frasier!

230
00:16:59,251 --> 00:17:02,003
You're pretty sick, you know that?

231
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:05,298
This is absurd!
Can't you recognise my...?

232
00:17:29,989 --> 00:17:32,492
Nice suit.

233
00:17:32,659 --> 00:17:36,412
- Oh, my God! lt's you!
- No! You're mine now!

234
00:17:36,579 --> 00:17:39,707
All right. l give up.

235
00:17:39,874 --> 00:17:42,001
Damn it! How did you find me?

236
00:17:42,168 --> 00:17:46,547
Denise called
to cancel your rendezvous.

237
00:17:46,714 --> 00:17:50,802
- Great. And l put on my best suit.
- No, you put on my best suit.

238
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:56,682
Well, l guess this is it.
Party's over. l'm so stupid!

239
00:17:56,849 --> 00:17:59,143
You want to call the police?

240
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:01,938
No. l'd like to throttle you

241
00:18:02,105 --> 00:18:06,275
till your eyes shoot across the room
like champagne corks!

242
00:18:06,818 --> 00:18:11,823
But this is still a civilised world, though
not for long if you have your way!

243
00:18:11,989 --> 00:18:15,868
Every wallet you steal puts bars
on someone else's windows.

244
00:18:16,035 --> 00:18:19,664
Every purse you snatch
puts mace on another key chain!

245
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:25,753
You make our lives less liveable and
l hope that burns on your conscience!

246
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:29,256
What do you have to say for yourself?

247
00:18:31,092 --> 00:18:33,386
You're right.

248
00:18:33,552 --> 00:18:38,015
l see. You think by agreeing with me,
l'll let you off the hook.

249
00:18:38,182 --> 00:18:42,561
No, you're right.
l'm guilty and l deserve what l get.

250
00:18:42,728 --> 00:18:47,316
Your keys. The car's out front
with your briefcase in it.

251
00:18:47,483 --> 00:18:52,112
Call the police. That's your new
car phone, by the way. l upgraded.

252
00:18:55,699 --> 00:18:58,160
l knew things would turn out like this.

253
00:18:58,327 --> 00:19:01,372
Here comes the old sob story.

254
00:19:01,538 --> 00:19:06,752
''My parents didn't love me, the bully
next door stole my baseball glove.''

255
00:19:06,919 --> 00:19:12,257
No. Dad loved me. Mom spoiled me
and l was the bully next door.

256
00:19:12,424 --> 00:19:16,470
- Let me do that. lt's kind of tricky.
- Thank you.

257
00:19:16,637 --> 00:19:19,515
l myself am to blame for my problems.

258
00:19:19,681 --> 00:19:22,643
Hi. The number
for the Seattle PD, please.

259
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:26,855
l take the easy way out of everything.
And you know why?

260
00:19:27,022 --> 00:19:31,193
l'm lazy. Lazy, lazy, lazy.

261
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,821
Oh, sweetheart,
could you just connect me?

262
00:19:34,988 --> 00:19:37,074
Thanks, hon.

263
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:42,496
Your life of crime
is down to your laziness?

264
00:19:42,663 --> 00:19:44,748
l don't like to work.

265
00:19:44,915 --> 00:19:49,086
lt's easier to take something
than to work. l'm a lazy criminal.

266
00:19:49,252 --> 00:19:52,964
A briefcase here,
car keys there, light shoplifting.

267
00:19:53,131 --> 00:19:57,552
But a bank robbery? All that planning!
Split-second timing.

268
00:19:57,719 --> 00:20:04,309
Forget it! And that second-storey stuff -
grappling hooks! Who does that?

269
00:20:04,476 --> 00:20:07,812
Yeah. Thank you. You're on hold.

270
00:20:07,979 --> 00:20:10,023
Story of my week.

271
00:20:10,982 --> 00:20:15,570
- You seem to be taking this well.
- lt was bound to happen.

272
00:20:15,737 --> 00:20:19,824
Perhaps you wanted to get caught.

273
00:20:19,991 --> 00:20:24,079
Think about it.
You've taken ever-greater risks.

274
00:20:24,245 --> 00:20:26,539
That's a man who wants to get caught.

275
00:20:26,706 --> 00:20:28,875
l'm telling you. Lazy!

276
00:20:29,042 --> 00:20:32,587
Your pants. You'd think
l'd have them hemmed? Staples.

277
00:20:32,754 --> 00:20:34,839
Oh, dear God!

278
00:20:36,216 --> 00:20:40,136
l still say that
you really wanted to get caught.

279
00:20:40,303 --> 00:20:45,225
<i>- lt's a classic cri de coeur.
- Cri de what?</i>

280
00:20:45,391 --> 00:20:49,228
lt means you don't like the life
that you're living.

281
00:20:49,395 --> 00:20:51,439
lt's not a great life.

282
00:20:51,606 --> 00:20:56,611
l don't know where my rent's coming
from, l have no solid relationship.

283
00:20:56,778 --> 00:21:01,074
- Why don't you change?
- Gimme an 'L'. Gimme an 'A'...

284
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:07,872
As a psychiatrist, l don't buy that.
You're not lazy. You are afraid.

285
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:11,375
There are lots of things
you could do legitimately.

286
00:21:11,542 --> 00:21:14,587
You're afraid to try one of them
and fail at it.

287
00:21:14,754 --> 00:21:17,673
- You think l can change?
- Yes.

288
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,760
l believe in the basic goodness
of people.

289
00:21:20,927 --> 00:21:24,180
Hello. Yes. Just a moment, please.

290
00:21:25,806 --> 00:21:29,810
Start now.
Take responsibility for yourself.

291
00:21:29,977 --> 00:21:33,230
For once, don't take the easy way out.

292
00:21:37,193 --> 00:21:40,654
Hello? Yeah, l'd like to report a crime.

293
00:21:40,821 --> 00:21:43,991
He's been impersonating
Frasier Crane!

294
00:21:44,158 --> 00:21:47,870
- Let's go.
- What? l am Frasier Crane.

295
00:21:48,037 --> 00:21:52,124
- Do you have any lD?
- No, but it's true. Tell them.

296
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:55,336
Thank God you're here.
l've detained him.

297
00:21:55,503 --> 00:21:58,923
- What?!
- But he's lying! He's the impostor!

298
00:21:59,089 --> 00:22:03,636
Don't you recognise me?
This is madness!

299
00:22:03,802 --> 00:22:09,808
People of the world, listen to me! Trust
