1
00:00:11,461 --> 00:00:13,504
(Martin) Quiet. lt's starting.

2
00:00:13,671 --> 00:00:17,300
(TV Presenter) 'This is a political
announcement for Holden Thorpe. '

3
00:00:17,467 --> 00:00:20,303
You dragged us here to see Thorpe?

4
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:24,056
He's a fascist, like Himmler
without the whimsy.

5
00:00:26,809 --> 00:00:28,853
(Man) 'Another American
for Holden Thorpe.'

6
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:30,897
'l'm Marty Crane.'

7
00:00:31,147 --> 00:00:36,152
- Dear God!
- 'For 30 years l was a cop.

8
00:00:36,319 --> 00:00:40,448
'Then l was shot by an assassin
who wouldn't have been free

9
00:00:40,615 --> 00:00:43,826
'if it weren't for the bleeding hearts
in Congress.

10
00:00:44,076 --> 00:00:47,830
'l used to carry a gun.
Now l carry a cane.

11
00:00:49,999 --> 00:00:54,378
'l'm voting for Holden Thorpe.
He's running because l can't.'

12
00:00:57,214 --> 00:01:00,301
- Well?
- l don't know what to say.

13
00:01:00,468 --> 00:01:03,679
- l'm in a state of shock!
- Aren't we all?

14
00:01:03,846 --> 00:01:07,766
You were wonderful.
This calls for a celebration.

15
00:01:07,933 --> 00:01:10,561
- What'll you have?
- Give me a beer.

16
00:01:12,062 --> 00:01:15,190
Dad, how did this happen?

17
00:01:15,357 --> 00:01:18,944
l was in the park,
there was a rally for Thorpe.

18
00:01:19,111 --> 00:01:22,990
l talked to his people,
told them l was an ex-cop

19
00:01:23,157 --> 00:01:25,492
and they shoved a camera in my face.

20
00:01:25,659 --> 00:01:30,039
- They're exploiting you.
- No, they're not. l like Thorpe.

21
00:01:30,205 --> 00:01:33,584
How could you support
that odious hose-head?

22
00:01:33,751 --> 00:01:38,213
He once said, ''Cancer aside,
tobacco is good for the economy.''

23
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:41,049
He's for more cops on the street.

24
00:01:41,216 --> 00:01:43,719
lt can't hurt, now everyone's armed.

25
00:01:43,886 --> 00:01:46,180
We don't have many guns in England.

26
00:01:46,346 --> 00:01:49,641
You don't need guns.
You've got kidney pie.

27
00:01:52,686 --> 00:01:54,646
Hello.

28
00:01:54,813 --> 00:01:56,815
- lt's Duke.
- Oh!

29
00:01:56,982 --> 00:02:00,652
- Sherry?
- l couldn't, Niles. l'm too upset.

30
00:02:00,819 --> 00:02:02,946
l'm glad you liked it.

31
00:02:03,113 --> 00:02:06,950
l've got a lot of showbiz
secrets to tell you.

32
00:02:07,117 --> 00:02:11,997
They can make you cry on cue
by pulling a hair out of your nose.

33
00:02:12,164 --> 00:02:17,252
What? Really? Guys, quick!
Channel 1 4! My other spot!

34
00:02:17,419 --> 00:02:22,757
This one was my idea. Remember
Lyndon Johnson showing his scar?

35
00:02:22,924 --> 00:02:24,968
'Hi, l'm Marty Crane.

36
00:02:25,135 --> 00:02:29,598
'Crime isn't pretty.
lf you don't believe me, look at this.'

37
00:02:35,854 --> 00:02:38,481
- Can l help you?
- What's on today?

38
00:02:38,648 --> 00:02:41,109
- Kenyan blend.
- No, no, no.

39
00:02:41,276 --> 00:02:44,446
They still poach elephants.
What else?

40
00:02:44,612 --> 00:02:48,950
- Dark roast Brazilian.
- Not till they stop rain forest loss.

41
00:02:49,701 --> 00:02:53,580
- Salvadoran?
- Not with their human rights record.

42
00:02:53,746 --> 00:02:56,749
We're down to
the Hawaiian Cona blend.

43
00:02:56,916 --> 00:03:00,461
Or have they slaughtered
too many macadamia nuts?

44
00:03:03,006 --> 00:03:05,800
That'll be fine, thank you.

45
00:03:07,343 --> 00:03:09,804
- Niles.
- l can't stand it.

46
00:03:09,971 --> 00:03:15,143
l just walked by a store with 22 TV
sets in the window showing Dad's...

47
00:03:16,644 --> 00:03:19,188
...butt.

48
00:03:19,981 --> 00:03:22,984
l saw it. l don't know what's worse -

49
00:03:23,151 --> 00:03:26,237
seeing his butt, or what it stands for.

50
00:03:27,029 --> 00:03:30,950
l just can't believe
our father is actually endorsing

51
00:03:31,117 --> 00:03:33,411
that self-serving fear-monger.

52
00:03:33,578 --> 00:03:38,332
l've given this a lot of thought
and l realise Dad isn't the problem.

53
00:03:38,499 --> 00:03:42,587
He's supporting his candidate.
The problem lies with us.

54
00:03:42,753 --> 00:03:45,590
- Us? We've done nothing.
- Exactly.

55
00:03:45,756 --> 00:03:49,927
''For evil to triumph requires
only that good men do nothing.''

56
00:03:50,094 --> 00:03:53,389
- Edmund Burke.
- l have that quotation framed.

57
00:03:53,556 --> 00:03:57,476
l mean to put it in my office
but keep forgetting.

58
00:03:58,644 --> 00:04:02,732
Anyway, the time has come
for you and me to get involved.

59
00:04:02,898 --> 00:04:04,734
How?

60
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:08,028
Support Thorpe's opponent,
Phil Patterson.

61
00:04:08,195 --> 00:04:12,950
- l'm voting for Patterson.
- l had something more in mind.

62
00:04:13,117 --> 00:04:16,787
l spoke to some people
at Patterson's headquarters.

63
00:04:16,954 --> 00:04:19,832
They'd like you
to do a TV endorsement.

64
00:04:19,999 --> 00:04:22,042
Niles, l'd love to help,

65
00:04:22,209 --> 00:04:26,255
but you must realize that,
as a radio psychiatrist,

66
00:04:26,422 --> 00:04:30,217
l can't take the chance
of alienating my listeners.

67
00:04:30,384 --> 00:04:34,430
People needing help might be put off
if they knew my politics.

68
00:04:34,596 --> 00:04:39,184
Think about it. A candidate
like this doesn't come often.

69
00:04:39,351 --> 00:04:42,771
He's hard working,
he volunteers at a soup kitchen.

70
00:04:42,938 --> 00:04:47,276
He cares about people.
He believes in what we believe in.

71
00:04:47,443 --> 00:04:51,613
- Buy chocolates, send a kid to camp.
- Can't you see we're talking?

72
00:04:58,829 --> 00:05:03,625
Thank you for your call, Susan.
We'll be back after this message.

73
00:05:05,585 --> 00:05:10,048
(Holden Thorpe ) 'Crime: it's epidemic.
lt strikes fast and it can strike you.

74
00:05:10,215 --> 00:05:13,760
'l'm Holden Thorpe.
Send me to Washington because...'

75
00:05:13,927 --> 00:05:17,013
...it's better than having you here.

76
00:05:19,433 --> 00:05:22,894
He makes it sound like
it's either vote for him

77
00:05:23,061 --> 00:05:25,105
or be found murdered in bed.

78
00:05:25,272 --> 00:05:30,652
l wouldn't worry, Roz. What are the
chances of finding you there alone?

79
00:05:32,362 --> 00:05:34,948
- Sports fan, how they hanging?
- OK.

80
00:05:35,115 --> 00:05:37,158
l was talking to Roz.

81
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:47,419
Ten seconds.

82
00:05:47,627 --> 00:05:51,673
(Thorpe ) 'Vote for me. My programme
gives the streets back to the people.'

83
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:57,429
That's good. With your tax programme
that's where they'll be sleeping.

84
00:05:57,595 --> 00:06:01,891
We'll be back for one more call
after this newsbreak.

85
00:06:02,058 --> 00:06:05,145
Then, next up, Bob Bulldog Brisco...

86
00:06:08,273 --> 00:06:10,692
and the Gonzo Sports Show.

87
00:06:11,609 --> 00:06:16,197
- l've asked you not to do that.
- Way to be impartial, Doc.

88
00:06:16,364 --> 00:06:20,702
Thorpe's a good man. You voting
for that pretty boy Patterson?

89
00:06:20,868 --> 00:06:23,913
He's great.
His reapportionment plan makes sense.

90
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,749
Forget it. He's happily married.

91
00:06:28,668 --> 00:06:31,421
So is Thorpe. His wife's a cow,
he still loves her.

92
00:06:31,587 --> 00:06:35,425
- There's a bumper sticker.
- Back in a minute.

93
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:40,638
l liked your shot at Thorpe.
Our next caller disagrees.

94
00:06:41,472 --> 00:06:45,268
Really? Put him on.
l welcome contrasting viewpoints.

95
00:06:46,143 --> 00:06:48,771
Hello, Seattle.
Roz, who is on the line?

96
00:06:48,938 --> 00:06:51,816
On line one, we have Holden Thorpe.

97
00:06:54,277 --> 00:06:57,446
- Go ahead, caller.
- (Thorpe ) 'Crane? Thorpe.

98
00:06:57,613 --> 00:07:01,283
- 'Let me ask you, are you married?'
- Divorced.

99
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:07,248
- 'Did you ever serve in the military?'
- l have congenitally weak ankles.

100
00:07:07,415 --> 00:07:12,211
'l see. So a guy like you -
unmarried, didn't serve his country -

101

'criticizes a patriotic family man
who fought in the battle of Grenada.

102
00:07:18,134 --> 00:07:22,513
- 'l went in on the first wave.'
- On a surfboard, l suppose.

103
00:07:24,765 --> 00:07:27,560
'When the likes of you are off the radio,

104
00:07:27,726 --> 00:07:31,480
'America will be a nice,
friendly place to live again.'

105
00:07:31,647 --> 00:07:35,025
You've said your piece;
now listen to mine.

106
00:07:35,526 --> 00:07:40,698
Hang up, will you? You may not listen,
but Seattle will hear me out.

107
00:07:40,864 --> 00:07:44,159
They won't.
The show ended five seconds ago.

108
00:07:54,002 --> 00:07:56,046
Oh, hello, there.

109
00:07:56,213 --> 00:07:59,716
l'm Dr Frasier Crane.
You may know me from my radio show.

110
00:07:59,883 --> 00:08:03,595
Today,
l'm speaking as a concerned citizen.

111
00:08:03,762 --> 00:08:09,309
As a mental health expert,
l've been listening to Phil Patterson.

112
00:08:09,476 --> 00:08:12,229
l like the way his mind works.

113
00:08:12,396 --> 00:08:15,857
He's a visionary
who cares about the little people.

114
00:08:16,024 --> 00:08:21,571
That's why l'm proud to say
l'm behind Phil Patterson for Congress.

115
00:08:22,739 --> 00:08:26,743
Thanks, Frasier.
Together, we can live the dream.

116
00:08:30,747 --> 00:08:33,875
Phil Patterson: the sane choice.

117
00:08:34,501 --> 00:08:39,089
OK, give us five minutes
to adjust the lights and we'll shoot.

118
00:08:39,256 --> 00:08:41,925
Yes, adjust those lights.

119
00:08:42,092 --> 00:08:45,053
They need to be...
lighter and...brighter.

120
00:08:51,685 --> 00:08:53,978
- Thanks, Frasier.
- Our pleasure.

121
00:08:54,145 --> 00:08:57,982
The Cranes have a history
of political involvement.

122
00:08:58,149 --> 00:09:02,862
My wife has all our servants
at your campaign HQ licking envelopes.

123
00:09:04,114 --> 00:09:09,035
She'd do it herself, but the poor thing
can't produce saliva.

124
00:09:18,711 --> 00:09:22,632
- Hello.
- You agreed to keep him out.

125
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:28,429
You know how he gets. He whines
and whimpers until you can't stand it.

126
00:09:28,596 --> 00:09:31,474
Don't let them talk about you like that.

127
00:09:31,641 --> 00:09:34,060
She was talking about me.

128
00:09:34,686 --> 00:09:37,313
- Hi. Marty Crane.
- Phil Patterson.

129
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:40,441
You look familiar
but l can't place you.

130
00:09:40,608 --> 00:09:43,277
- Let me give you a hint.
- Dad!

131
00:09:44,487 --> 00:09:47,114
l'm just trying to help the guy!

132
00:09:47,281 --> 00:09:49,867
He did a commercial
for your opponent.

133
00:09:50,034 --> 00:09:52,286
Yes. lt came back to me.

134
00:09:53,579 --> 00:09:55,623
Hello. Daphne Moon.

135
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:59,168
My uncle was a political writer
for a London tabloid.

136
00:09:59,335 --> 00:10:03,589
l remember his biggest scoop.
The headline read:

137
00:10:03,756 --> 00:10:08,511
''High-ranking politician
caught in women's clothing.''

138
00:10:08,678 --> 00:10:11,555
On page two you found out
it was Margaret Thatcher,

139
00:10:11,722 --> 00:10:14,350
but by then you'd bought the paper.

140
00:10:20,523 --> 00:10:24,026
- Thank you, Miss Moon.
- lt's a little hot.

141
00:10:24,193 --> 00:10:27,446
- Want to step out on the balcony?
- Great.

142
00:10:29,406 --> 00:10:32,284
- Oh, beautiful view.
- Thank you.

143
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:36,121
Yes, l feel very lucky living here.

144
00:10:36,288 --> 00:10:40,417
And l feel lucky to be
a part of your campaign, as well.

145
00:10:40,584 --> 00:10:44,880
lt's me who's lucky. lt's a boost
to get an endorsement from you.

146
00:10:45,047 --> 00:10:49,009
- My name doesn't carry much weight.
- People love you.

147
00:10:49,176 --> 00:10:51,804
l've listened to your show.

148
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:55,516
To tell the truth,
l've even thought of calling in.

149
00:10:55,682 --> 00:10:58,268
Really? What for?

150
00:10:59,645 --> 00:11:02,397
Oh, it's kind of sensitive.

151
00:11:02,564 --> 00:11:05,275
Listen, Phil, as a psychiatrist,

152
00:11:05,442 --> 00:11:08,654
anything you tell me
will be in confidence.

153
00:11:11,073 --> 00:11:15,118
lt's funny how, the more
you bottle things up inside,

154
00:11:15,285 --> 00:11:17,663
the bigger they seem to be.

155
00:11:19,164 --> 00:11:22,584
Well, l've never
told anybody this before but...

156
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,504
OK, here goes.

157
00:11:26,755 --> 00:11:28,882
Six years ago,

158
00:11:29,049 --> 00:11:31,510
l was abducted by aliens.

159
00:11:48,777 --> 00:11:50,612
Aliens?

160
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:55,784
They took me to their spaceship
for a conference.

161
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:58,912
They're concerned about our planet.

162
00:11:59,996 --> 00:12:03,291
Hey, you were right.
Now l've said it out loud,

163
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:06,544
it's doesn't seem like that big a deal.

164
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:09,714
No.

165
00:12:11,633 --> 00:12:15,804
They're ready, gentlemen.
Let's elect a Congressman!

166
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:17,805
Frasier?

167
00:12:23,728 --> 00:12:25,563
Frasier?

168
00:12:28,316 --> 00:12:31,819
(Man) Roll it. And... Action.

169
00:12:36,783 --> 00:12:40,745
Hello. l'm Dr Frasier Crane.

170
00:12:41,454 --> 00:12:43,956
You may know me from my radio show,

171
00:12:44,123 --> 00:12:47,460
but today,
l'm speaking as a concerned citizen.

172
00:12:47,627 --> 00:12:50,004
A deeply concerned citizen.

173
00:12:53,007 --> 00:12:56,677
As a mental health expert,
l've been listening

174
00:12:56,844 --> 00:13:00,973
to what my good friend,
Phil Patterson, has to say.

175
00:13:01,974 --> 00:13:04,727
l like the way his mind works.

176
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:09,982
He's a visionary who cares about...

177
00:13:13,152 --> 00:13:15,363
...the ''little people''.

178
00:13:20,534 --> 00:13:22,870
That's why l'm proud to say

179
00:13:23,037 --> 00:13:26,707
that l'm behind Phil Patterson
for Congress.

180
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:29,960
Thanks, Frasier.

181
00:13:33,214 --> 00:13:36,300
Together, we can live the dream.

182
00:13:38,344 --> 00:13:40,554
Phil Patterson...

183
00:13:40,721 --> 00:13:43,265
the sane choice.

184
00:13:43,515 --> 00:13:46,977
- OK, cut!
- God, l'm burning up!

185
00:13:50,397 --> 00:13:54,777
You were nervous.
Take a few minutes and we'll try again.

186
00:13:55,027 --> 00:13:58,155
l got mine on the first take!

187
00:13:58,322 --> 00:14:01,366
Frasier, may l see you in the kitchen?

188
00:14:03,202 --> 00:14:05,245
What's going on?

189
00:14:05,412 --> 00:14:08,081
l've something to get off of my chest

190
00:14:08,248 --> 00:14:11,877
but l'd be violating
doctor-patient confidence.

191
00:14:12,127 --> 00:14:16,298
Nothing is more sacrosanct
than professional ethics.

192
00:14:16,548 --> 00:14:20,177
Fortunately,
l know a trick to get around them.

193
00:14:24,056 --> 00:14:28,935
l'll be your psychiatrist. Then you
can spill your guts with impunity.

194
00:14:29,102 --> 00:14:31,438
lt's borderline, but l'm desperate.

195
00:14:33,065 --> 00:14:36,943
Just now, on the balcony,

196
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:41,573
Phil Patterson told me he had been...
abducted by aliens.

197
00:14:44,117 --> 00:14:48,663
Apparently, he was beamed up
to the mother ship

198
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:52,042
for a little interplanetary chitchat.

199
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:00,425
This is bad, isn't it?

200
00:15:02,177 --> 00:15:05,972
Niles, it's awful.
We'll look like such idiots!

201
00:15:06,222 --> 00:15:09,601
We?
lt was your idea to get into politics.

202
00:15:09,768 --> 00:15:13,438
My idea? l can't believe
you have the gall to tell me...

203
00:15:13,605 --> 00:15:15,648
l wanted to stop you.

204
00:15:15,815 --> 00:15:19,736
This isn't getting us anywhere.
Put that away!

205
00:15:21,237 --> 00:15:24,365
All right. What are we going to do?

206
00:15:24,532 --> 00:15:27,869
Convince Phil to drop out
and seek help.

207
00:15:28,036 --> 00:15:30,705
- lf he drops out, Thorpe wins.
- Forget it!

208
00:15:30,955 --> 00:15:36,377
- Then forget education and the arts.
- l should still back Phil?

209
00:15:36,544 --> 00:15:40,590
Can you tell me with certainty,
in such a vast universe,

210
00:15:40,757 --> 00:15:43,760
there isn't intelligent life elsewhere?

211
00:15:44,927 --> 00:15:48,264
At present, l'm not sure there
is intelligent life in this kitchen!

212
00:15:52,435 --> 00:15:56,939
Assume it's in his imagination.
How often does he see them?

213
00:15:57,190 --> 00:16:01,235
Only once. Which suggests
it was brought on by overwork,

214
00:16:01,402 --> 00:16:03,863
rather than a paranoid delusion.

215
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:08,576
- My diagnosis exactly.
- Phil deserves his chance.

216
00:16:08,743 --> 00:16:12,997
- He still needs professional help.
- Yes! The best there is.

217
00:16:13,164 --> 00:16:18,502
- But we won't turn our backs on him.
- No. So will you treat him?

218
00:16:18,669 --> 00:16:21,297
l'm a doctor, not a miracle worker!

219
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:31,182
lt's time l got my eyebrows waxed.
l'm getting that Romanian peasant look.

220
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:36,687
- lt doesn't help that l haven't slept.
- Dating a snorer?

221
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:43,485
l'm getting tired of your constant
insinuation that l sleep around.

222
00:16:43,652 --> 00:16:48,407
l didn't sleep 'cause of Chopper Dave.
When he's bored with traffic reports,

223
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:51,827
he likes to buzz people's apartments
in his helicopter.

224
00:16:51,994 --> 00:16:54,788
- Annoying.
- lt didn't bother me.

225
00:16:54,955 --> 00:16:59,710
But the guy l was with
is a Vietnam vet and he had flashbacks.

226
00:17:01,211 --> 00:17:04,089
Greetings, losers! Heard the news?

227
00:17:04,256 --> 00:17:08,594
One of your overpaid idols
passed his urine test?

228
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:12,890
Laugh, but word's out
about Patterson and his aliens.

229
00:17:13,056 --> 00:17:16,059
- My God!
- lt's all over TV.

230
00:17:16,226 --> 00:17:20,314
- How did they find out?
- You can't keep this quiet.

231
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,026
Every station is serving
his heart on a platter.

232
00:17:24,192 --> 00:17:28,113
lt's just like the media
to find a flaw to ruin a career.

233
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,490
l have a conduit to the public ear.

234
00:17:30,657 --> 00:17:34,995
- l won't let Phil go without a fight!
- What aliens?

235
00:17:35,162 --> 00:17:40,751
Patterson's got two illegal aliens
from Guatemala working in his house.

236
00:17:42,335 --> 00:17:45,213
No green cards, no documents,
no chance!

237
00:17:47,799 --> 00:17:50,552
Hello, Seattle.
This is Dr Frasier Crane.

238
00:17:50,719 --> 00:17:54,890
l have just learned that
it has become public knowledge

239
00:17:55,056 --> 00:17:59,728
that Phil Patterson believes
in aliens from outer space.

240
00:18:01,938 --> 00:18:04,691
Not only that,
he believes he has met them,

241
00:18:04,858 --> 00:18:08,486
that he was beamed aboard
their spaceship for a chat.

242
00:18:08,653 --> 00:18:14,534
Shocked? Well, all right.
But let's ask ourselves these questions.

243
00:18:14,701 --> 00:18:16,828
Does this harmless delusion,

244
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:21,207
most likely brought on
by overwork and sleep deprivation,

245
00:18:21,374 --> 00:18:25,253
adversely affect his voting record?
l say no!

246
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,964
What leader doesn't have quirks?

247
00:18:28,131 --> 00:18:31,801
Reagan saw astrologers.
Patton believed in reincarnation.

248
00:18:31,968 --> 00:18:35,305
Even Hoover let his slip show
once in a while.

249
00:18:36,306 --> 00:18:38,433
People, this is a great leader.

250
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:42,020
We shouldn't consider
minor eccentricities.

251
00:18:42,186 --> 00:18:46,357
What's important, what really counts,
is what's in here.

252
00:18:46,524 --> 00:18:49,152
l'm pointing at my chest now.

253
00:18:56,868 --> 00:19:01,789
(TV Presenter) 'The results are in.
Holden Thorpe is elected

254
00:19:01,956 --> 00:19:04,667
'with a whopping 92% of the vote.'

255
00:19:06,919 --> 00:19:09,672
At least Mr Patterson got 8%.

256
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:13,885
They must have counted
absentee votes from planet Krypton.

257
00:19:15,511 --> 00:19:18,723
Now, Dr Crane. lt wasn't all your fault.

258
00:19:18,889 --> 00:19:22,768
Those Guatemalans
would have cost him votes anyway.

259
00:19:22,935 --> 00:19:26,480
Those Guatemalans
were exchange students.

260
00:19:26,647 --> 00:19:31,318
Phil gave them room and board
to show goodwill between countries.

261
00:19:31,485 --> 00:19:34,905
l'd like to stay and gloat,
but l've got to change

262
00:19:35,072 --> 00:19:39,869
to go to the celebration at Thorpe HQ.
You're welcome to tag along.

263
00:19:40,035 --> 00:19:43,038
You're quite a hero down there!

264
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:46,917
No, thank you!

265
00:19:47,084 --> 00:19:49,920
Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!

266
00:19:50,087 --> 00:19:53,007
When will l learn
it hurts when l do that?

267
00:19:53,173 --> 00:19:55,217
(Doorbell)

268
00:20:03,183 --> 00:20:07,396
- Oh. Phil. Come on in.
- Hi, Frasier. Thank you.

269
00:20:07,563 --> 00:20:12,109
Just came by to return
this good-luck tie you loaned me.

270
00:20:14,278 --> 00:20:18,323
l saw you wearing it
for your concession speech.

271
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:22,411
A little embarrassing,
having to do it before lunch.

272
00:20:22,578 --> 00:20:26,039
But it gave me time
to pick up my dry cleaning.

273
00:20:26,999 --> 00:20:29,543
- l am so sorry.
- lt's OK.

274
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:35,132
- You thought you were defending me.
- Seattle deserves better than Thorpe.

275
00:20:36,133 --> 00:20:38,677
That's politics. lt's just one election.

276
00:20:38,844 --> 00:20:41,972
- l'll be back.
- You really think you can?

277
00:20:42,139 --> 00:20:46,309
Maybe l'm a dreamer,
but l believe anything's possible.

278
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:50,021
Phil.

279
00:20:50,188 --> 00:20:52,482
l've got to ask you...

280
00:20:55,735 --> 00:20:58,363
Do you really believe it happened?

281
00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:02,868
l honestly wish
l could say it didn't, but it did.

282
00:21:03,034 --> 00:21:07,872
l guess you'll never believe it
unless it happens to you.

283
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:10,500
So, what's next for you?

284
00:21:11,793 --> 00:21:14,296
Maybe l'll run in California.

285
00:21:16,464 --> 00:21:20,009
A thing like this
could actually help me there.

286
00:21:48,037 --> 00:21:50,206
Anything's possible.

287
00:22:02,593 --> 00:22:05,054
Oh, very funny, Chopper Dave!

288
00:22:14,355 --> 00:22:20,027
# Hey baby, l hear the blues are calling
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

289
00:22:20,194 --> 00:22:21,571
# Quite stylish!

290
00:22:21,737 --> 00:22:26,575
# And maybe l seem a bit confused
Well, maybe...but l got you pegged!

291
00:22:28,661 --> 00:22:34,500
# But l don't know what to do with those
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

292
00:22:34,667 --> 00:22:37,294
# They're calling again #

293
00:22:37,461 --> 00:22:40,131
Good night, Seattle, we love you!
