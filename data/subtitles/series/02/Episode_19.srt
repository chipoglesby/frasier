1
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:11,428
(Fire alarm beeps)

2
00:00:11,595 --> 00:00:15,307
Oh, my God! Fire, fire!

3
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:18,894
Eddie, where are you, boy?

4
00:00:19,061 --> 00:00:22,397
- Dad, wake up! Are you in there?
- Here, Eddie!

5
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:24,608
Dad, where are you?

6
00:00:24,775 --> 00:00:28,403
- Have you seen Eddie?
- No! Where is the fire?

7
00:00:29,655 --> 00:00:32,783
lt's all right! False alarm!

8
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:35,202
The one over my bed went off.

9
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:39,706
- Thank God.
- And Eddie's back in my room.

10
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,792
The noise it makes!

11
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:45,420
lt would be less upsetting
to wake up on fire.

12
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:49,091
- What triggered it?
- Who knows?

13
00:00:49,258 --> 00:00:53,595
l was dozing when it started
screaming away for no reason.

14
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:59,184
l see. What have we here?

15
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:03,272
Eddie, you've been smoking
in Daphne's room! Bad dog!

16
00:01:04,106 --> 00:01:08,026
l know you have
a no-smoking rule. l'm sorry.

17
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:13,615
Every now and again, l feel a bit tense
and l find a ciggy can be soothing.

18
00:01:13,866 --> 00:01:18,829
Real soothing! lt should be an hour
until my heart stops fibrillating.

19
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:25,169
lt figures. 3:00 am, on the night
before l have an early meeting.

20
00:01:27,129 --> 00:01:29,173
Aren't you going back to bed?

21
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:31,550
No. l'll just sit up for a bit.

22
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:35,929
- l'm feeling a bit blue.
- Anything you'd like to talk about?

23
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:40,017
No. You need your sleep.
lt's nothing important.

24
00:01:40,184 --> 00:01:43,145
Just that my life's a gaping sinkhole

25
00:01:43,312 --> 00:01:48,150
and l'm marking time while
the flower of my youth rots on the vine.

26
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:52,321
Well, so long as you're sure.

27
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,912
l really wish you'd tell me about it.

28
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:06,251
- lf you must know, it's my love life.
- Really? Have you been seeing a man?

29
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:10,130
Only when l close my eyes
and concentrate.

30
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:16,053
- Going through a bit of a drought?
- Small wonder.

31
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:19,765
The rare times l do go out,
it's with your father.

32
00:02:19,932 --> 00:02:23,852
People assume
l'm his daughter or his girlfriend.

33
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:28,565
Either way, it's like having
a personal can of stud repellent.

34
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:34,780
l know how bleak these times can be,
but they end sooner or later.

35
00:02:34,947 --> 00:02:38,825
l remember a time when
l was going through the same.

36
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:42,621
Just a week later,
l met a lovely barmaid.

37
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:45,791
Sophisticated, if a bit loquacious.

38
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:49,878
We fell madly in love.
We got engaged.

39
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:56,301
She left me standing at the altar
but the point is, l didn't give up.

40
00:02:56,468 --> 00:03:00,514
l took my poor, battered heart
and offered it to Lilith.

41
00:03:03,559 --> 00:03:07,688
Put it in her food processor
and hit the purée button.

42
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:12,442
l rebounded,
and look how far l've come.

43
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:17,906
l'm divorced, lonely...
living with my father.

44
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:38,051
You missed your meeting
with the new station manager.

45
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,679
Oh, no! l completely forgot.

46
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:44,975
You look like you've been
ridden hard and put away wet.

47
00:03:45,184 --> 00:03:50,105
l was up with Daphne, competing to
see whose love life was more pathetic.

48
00:03:50,314 --> 00:03:53,317
On the bright side, l won.

49
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:56,737
l know what your problems are.
What are hers?

50
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:59,990
She's just having trouble
finding men.

51
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:03,994
- Say no more.
- No, Roz, please.

52
00:04:04,203 --> 00:04:07,539
You do not have to donate
one of your boyfriends.

53
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:12,211
- l'd be happy to.
- One hates to break up a collection.

54
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,175
Triple espresso and my mocha latte.

55
00:04:18,342 --> 00:04:21,345
- Does that chocolate look different?
- No.

56
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:25,849
l think they've switched
to an inferior domestic brand.

57
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,523
Waxy.

58
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:37,277
- Sven Bachman, an aerobics coach.
- No.

59
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:42,658
This one's perfect. Günther Dietrich.
He's loads of fun and he's a model.

60
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:46,370
A German narcissist.
Appealing combination.

61
00:04:48,372 --> 00:04:51,083
- OK. l'll keep looking.
- For what?

62
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,669
A man for Daphne.

63
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:01,301
- What?
- Here we go.

64
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:04,555
He's a tennis instructor called Brick.

65
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:08,392
Dear God, Frasier!
Sven, Günther, Brick?

66
00:05:08,559 --> 00:05:14,314
Why not just soak Daphne in baby oil
and hurl her over the prison wall?

67
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:20,988
l've dated all these guys.

68
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:25,075
Where do you think
l came up with the imagery?

69
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,787
Listen, you little titmouse...

70
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:33,167
Niles, you are out of line here.
And, Roz, he does have a point.

71
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,794
You and Daphne are different.

72
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:38,881
Daphne is very shy and inexperienced.

73
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:43,343
You are... You'd be hard-pressed
to find anyone who's more...

74
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:48,640
No one l've dated is good enough for
her. ls that what you're trying to say?

75
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:52,186
No.
That's what l'm trying not to say.

76
00:05:52,436 --> 00:05:54,646
- l'm out of here.
- Wait!

77
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:57,649
No, l can't stay!
The fleet is in!

78
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:03,989
(High-pitched electronic whine )

79
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:16,668
And this concludes our test
of the emergency broadcast system.

80
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:21,757
ln a real emergency, your radio
would be melting in your hands.

81
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:28,514
We'll be right back
after these messages.

82
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:33,435
ln future, please keep
your half-eaten food off my console.

83
00:06:33,602 --> 00:06:38,065
- ln fact, stay out of my sight.
- You're still mad. l can tell.

84
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:43,111
There's that sensitivity that keeps
you in such demand with the ladies.

85
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:47,533
Roz, l'm sorry if l insulted you,

86
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:50,869
but l feel very protective
about Daphne.

87
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:55,332
The man l'm looking for
has to be good-looking, smart...

88
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:57,835
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

89
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:02,047
- l'm Tom Duran, the new manager.
- Pleasure to meet you.

90
00:07:02,214 --> 00:07:05,425
Sorry about the meeting.
l slept through it.

91
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:10,013
Yeah, me too, and l was there.
Say, that's a beautiful tie.

92
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:15,227
l got this in London at one of
those custom shops off Sloane Square.

93
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:18,897
l just came from London.
Five years with the BBC.

94
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:23,735
Really? l love London.
The museums, the theatre.

95
00:07:23,986 --> 00:07:27,197
Yeah. l'm a big theatre buff.
l hated leaving.

96
00:07:27,406 --> 00:07:31,535
- Why did you?
- l just went through a messy break-up.

97
00:07:31,702 --> 00:07:35,497
l thought l'd sleep better
with a continent between us.

98
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:37,833
Yes, l know the feeling.

99
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:44,256
So...
l take it then you are unattached?

100
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:47,634
Yes, but l haven't given up hope.

101
00:07:47,885 --> 00:07:50,929
- You may be in the right place.
- Really?

102
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:52,431
Yes.

103
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:55,184
- You're fond of the English?
- Yes.

104
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:59,104
l have a weakness for people
who are a bit eccentric.

105
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:01,398
- Really?
- 1 5 seconds.

106
00:08:01,565 --> 00:08:03,901
- Nice meeting you.
- Likewise.

107
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:07,154
Tom, this may sound like short notice

108
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:10,407
but if you're free Saturday,
come for dinner.

109
00:08:10,574 --> 00:08:13,118
- Thanks. l'd like that.
- Great!

110
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:18,916
Hello, Seattle. We're back.
Roz, whom do we have next?

111
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:21,460
(Roz) James from Tacoma on line one.

112
00:08:21,627 --> 00:08:24,171
Hello, James. l'm listening.

113
00:08:25,756 --> 00:08:27,966
- Hey, Roz.
- Hey, Tom.

114
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:31,970
Every job l take,
word spreads like wildfire.

115
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:34,556
- What's that?
- Oh, you know.

116
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:39,228
Tell one or two people you're gay
and it's all over the station.

117
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:44,775
Well, they don't call it broadcasting
for nothing.

118
00:08:45,651 --> 00:08:48,779
- He seems like a nice guy.
- He's OK.

119
00:08:48,946 --> 00:08:53,534
l hope he's more than OK.
He just asked me out on a date.

120
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:02,584
- Frasier asked you out on a date?
- He asked me round for dinner.

121
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:04,795
What's his favourite wine?

122
00:09:05,087 --> 00:09:07,172
- You should know...
- What?

123
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:13,178
- He's nuts about Chardonnay.
- Thanks.

124
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:25,315
Does he ask permission first?
No, he sets me up

125
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:29,695
and l'm supposed to turn cartwheels
like l'm Cinderella.

126
00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:35,450
l told you, this is not a setup.
Tom doesn't even know you'll be here.

127
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:38,412
Oh, an ambush, then.
Much nicer.

128
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:42,624
My friends in Manchester
used to set me up.

129
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:46,336
Always some gangly bounder
with a long reach

130
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:49,965
and he wasn't going
for the Colman's mustard!

131
00:09:50,132 --> 00:09:54,178
Tom is just a co-worker
coming by for a pleasant dinner.

132
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:58,265
lf some spark ignites, fine,
but there is no pressure.

133
00:09:58,432 --> 00:10:02,978
- ls that what you're wearing?
- Why? What's wrong with it?

134
00:10:03,145 --> 00:10:04,479
(Doorbell)

135
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:06,690
What about something
with more oomph?

136
00:10:06,857 --> 00:10:09,735
What about that strapless number?

137
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:14,907
Do you have any idea how
uncomfortable a strapless bra is?

138
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:18,869
Thanks to my fraternity days,
as a matter of fact, l do.

139
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:26,502
Tom, come in!
Good to see you.

140
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:31,465
- l thought you'd like Chardonnay.
- Oh, my! That's my favourite.

141
00:10:33,008 --> 00:10:35,844
- Like the place?
- lt's a hell of a view.

142
00:10:36,053 --> 00:10:39,139
lt's even better from the bedroom.

143
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:46,730
Why don't we just start
with a drink?

144
00:10:49,066 --> 00:10:53,445
- Four places. Who's joining us?
- Just my little household.

145
00:10:53,612 --> 00:10:57,032
My father and his physical therapist,
charming Daphne.

146
00:10:57,199 --> 00:10:59,576
You live with your dad?

147
00:10:59,743 --> 00:11:03,372
l can't imagine that.
lt's great you get along,

148
00:11:03,539 --> 00:11:07,626
but doesn't having him here
kind of cramp your love life?

149
00:11:07,793 --> 00:11:12,881
Not at all. Except when l bring my
dates home, he tries to steal them.

150
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:21,723
He's quite the old rascal.

151
00:11:22,641 --> 00:11:26,436
- Good evening.
- Oh, look who we have here!

152
00:11:27,938 --> 00:11:32,359
Tom, l'd like you to meet Daphne.
Daphne, this is Tom Duran.

153
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:34,778
- lt's a pleasure.
- Likewise.

154
00:11:34,945 --> 00:11:38,532
Dr Crane, you didn't take his coat.
May l?

155
00:11:39,867 --> 00:11:43,579
(lnaudible )

156
00:11:46,498 --> 00:11:50,919
Ooh, this is strange! l'm picking up
a vibration from your coat.

157
00:11:51,086 --> 00:11:54,548
- Excuse me?
- She feels she has psychic powers.

158
00:11:54,715 --> 00:12:00,721
- You know those English eccentrics.
- You've just had a painful break-up.

159
00:12:00,888 --> 00:12:04,558
- Yes. You told her that!
- No.

160
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:07,853
A bitter dispute
over opera recordings.

161
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:15,819
Excuse me. l'll nip into the kitchen.
l have a bird to baste.

162
00:12:19,198 --> 00:12:23,368
- Quite something, huh?
- She's great! l love that accent!

163
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:27,414
Frasier, l don't have to put a tie on
for this joker, do l?

164
00:12:31,001 --> 00:12:34,963
- Tom, my father, Martin Crane.
- Nice to meet you.

165
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:40,385
Sorry about that ''joker'' business.
l call everybody joker. Or jerk.

166
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:43,388
Pinhead. Bozo.

167
00:12:43,555 --> 00:12:47,184
Amazingly, he's free for dinner
on short notice.

168
00:12:47,351 --> 00:12:50,145
Why don't l just open this wine?

169
00:12:51,563 --> 00:12:54,274
- Well?
- Oh, he's a looker!

170
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:56,485
l'm glad to have my lucky bra.

171
00:12:56,652 --> 00:13:00,072
He's worth every wire
digging into my rib cage.

172
00:13:00,239 --> 00:13:03,242
He thinks you're great, too.

173
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:06,119
Oh, go on! Oh, God!

174
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:09,790
Listen to me getting carried away
like a schoolgirl!

175
00:13:09,957 --> 00:13:12,584
No, l'm not raising my hopes tonight.

176
00:13:12,751 --> 00:13:15,462
Though l'm glad l raised my bosom.

177
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:19,174
You'll love Seattle.
lt's a real people place.

178
00:13:19,341 --> 00:13:22,636
- Good food, great bars.
- Any you recommend?

179
00:13:22,803 --> 00:13:26,807
l hang out at Duke's. Great crowd.
Lot of young cops.

180
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:36,775
- You like football?
- Yeah! l missed it in London.

181
00:13:36,942 --> 00:13:41,488
We could see a game. Frasier hates it,
so it would just be us.

182
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:44,575
Hey, Frasier warned me about you.

183
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:49,621
Yeah, l guess l yell
at the players too loud.

184
00:13:49,788 --> 00:13:51,832
Here we are. Tom...

185
00:13:53,292 --> 00:13:56,295
Dad, l selected
a little vintage for you, too.

186
00:13:56,461 --> 00:13:59,047
l didn't bring the pull-tab
for you to sniff.

187
00:13:59,214 --> 00:14:01,592
<i>Merci beaucoup.</i>

188
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:03,552
(Doorbell rings)

189
00:14:03,719 --> 00:14:05,762
Excuse me.

190
00:14:09,892 --> 00:14:13,228
- Oh, Niles.
- Hello, Frasier. Oh, thank you.

191
00:14:14,897 --> 00:14:19,902
- l'm just returning your book.
- Thank you. Don't let me keep you.

192
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:24,573
- Am l interrupting something?
- l'm introducing a man to Daphne.

193
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:27,409
- l guess you don't want me around.
- Thank you.

194
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,370
How do you do?

195
00:14:32,122 --> 00:14:34,666
- l'm Dr Niles Crane.
- l'm Tom Duran.

196
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:39,171
The bird's done. All l need
is strong arms to haul it out.

197
00:14:39,338 --> 00:14:42,174
l don't need to be asked twice.

198
00:14:50,349 --> 00:14:55,938
During the interview, her stomach
rumbles and her body mic picks it up.

199
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:58,148
But what can l say?

200
00:14:58,315 --> 00:15:02,277
''Excuse me, would Her Majesty
care for a Tums?''

201
00:15:04,321 --> 00:15:08,700
l could listen to your stories
all night. They're so funny.

202
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:11,620
And all involving bodily functions.

203
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:19,336
Tom, l could use a little hand.

204
00:15:19,503 --> 00:15:23,674
No, Daphne. After all that cooking,
you must be strapless.

205
00:15:34,852 --> 00:15:38,730
- Niles, can l speak with you?
- Yes.

206
00:15:38,897 --> 00:15:42,442
- Did l do anything that offended you?
- No.

207
00:15:43,902 --> 00:15:49,199
lt must be in my head. l sensed you
had a problem with me dating Frasier.

208
00:15:49,366 --> 00:15:52,077
Well, if you must know...

209
00:16:01,003 --> 00:16:03,714
l'm sorry, what was the question?

210
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:09,136
Do you have a problem
with me dating your brother?

211
00:16:11,722 --> 00:16:13,348
No.

212
00:16:15,851 --> 00:16:19,688
Niles, l didn't ask Tom to dinner
so he could talk to you.

213
00:16:19,855 --> 00:16:23,400
There are others
who would like a crack at him.

214
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:40,709
That Tom's a great guy.
You think maybe him and Daphne...?

215
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,926
l can't remember when l last had
such a wonderful evening.

216
00:16:49,092 --> 00:16:53,388
We should thank you. l can't remember
when l've laughed so hard.

217
00:16:53,555 --> 00:16:57,100
(Raucous laughter)

218
00:17:00,312 --> 00:17:03,482
You've still got Mr Crane going.

219
00:17:03,649 --> 00:17:07,986
- Daphne, music might be appropriate.
- Good idea.

220
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:13,992
She's quite a woman, isn't she?

221
00:17:14,159 --> 00:17:16,620
Yes, she's really something.

222
00:17:16,787 --> 00:17:19,915
- Frasier, l was wondering...
- Yes?

223
00:17:20,082 --> 00:17:25,212
Before the evening's over, could we
get a little one-on-one time?

224
00:17:25,379 --> 00:17:28,048
Ooh, l think l can arrange that.

225
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:36,557
He says he wants
to be alone with you.

226
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:41,603
This is my lucky bra! Keep the wine
flowing! l'll fix my lipstick!

227
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:44,815
l guess l'd better
be hitting the old sack.

228
00:17:46,567 --> 00:17:50,195
l don't want to stand
in the way of young romance.

229
00:17:50,362 --> 00:17:52,406
- Thanks.
- Good night, Tom.

230
00:17:52,573 --> 00:17:55,284
Good night, Martin.

231
00:17:55,993 --> 00:17:58,912
- You should run along, too.
- Yes.

232
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:01,915
And Frasier, l was wrong about Tom.

233
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:05,419
lf l had to choose a man for Daphne,
l'd pick him.

234
00:18:05,586 --> 00:18:08,380
- Night, Tom. Nice to meet you.
- Night.

235
00:18:08,547 --> 00:18:11,300
Frasier, a word in your ear.

236
00:18:13,343 --> 00:18:15,387
Excuse me.

237
00:18:15,971 --> 00:18:20,934
l have to tell you something.
Dad wanted to, but l won the toss.

238
00:18:25,189 --> 00:18:28,025
- Yes?
- l had a little chat with Tom.

239
00:18:28,192 --> 00:18:33,739
He's interested in pursuing a romance
but his object is not Daphne.

240
00:18:33,906 --> 00:18:36,158
Damn that Roz!

241
00:18:36,325 --> 00:18:39,203
No, no. lt's you.

242
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:45,959
Me? That's impossible.
Tom's not gay.

243
00:18:46,126 --> 00:18:49,713
He seems to be
under that impression.

244
00:18:55,344 --> 00:18:59,223
What made him think...?
l just asked if he was attached.

245
00:18:59,389 --> 00:19:04,144
Then we talked about the theatre
and men's fashion... Oh, my God!

246
00:19:06,021 --> 00:19:10,692
- You realise what this means?
- Yes. You're dating your boss.

247
00:19:15,072 --> 00:19:20,160
You, of all people, should know
the pitfalls of an office relationship.

248
00:19:20,327 --> 00:19:23,539
But he didn't say...
He never mentioned...

249
00:19:23,705 --> 00:19:28,293
l'll call you tomorrow.
But not too early of course.

250
00:19:43,392 --> 00:19:45,018
So...

251
00:19:45,561 --> 00:19:47,479
So...

252
00:19:48,397 --> 00:19:50,983
God, l hate this song!

253
00:19:51,149 --> 00:19:56,321
l've broken my rule for you.
l usually don't date guys l work with.

254
00:19:56,488 --> 00:20:00,409
Yes, well, l've sort of
relaxed my rule for you, too.

255
00:20:10,043 --> 00:20:13,213
You're cute when you're nervous.

256
00:20:16,884 --> 00:20:19,511
l must be downright adorable now.

257
00:20:21,847 --> 00:20:28,395
Listen, Tom. l'm sorry, but we seem
to have gotten our lines crossed here.

258
00:20:30,063 --> 00:20:33,317
The truth is, l'm entirely straight.

259
00:20:34,151 --> 00:20:36,904
lf you're not interested,
just say so.

260
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:39,156
No, it's true. l really am.

261
00:20:39,323 --> 00:20:44,244
l invited you because you seemed
so charming and you like the British.

262
00:20:44,411 --> 00:20:47,498
l thought you might be perfect
for Daphne.

263
00:20:47,664 --> 00:20:51,710
l can't believe this!
You had no idea that l'm gay?

264
00:21:03,555 --> 00:21:07,309
lt never even occurred to me
that you might be gay.

265
00:21:07,476 --> 00:21:12,981
Well, it never even occurred
to me that you might be straight.

266
00:21:13,148 --> 00:21:15,067
Thank you.

267
00:21:16,944 --> 00:21:21,823
l feel just awful. lt seems
l've just been leading you on all night.

268
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:24,243
Oh, it's OK. Honest mistake.

269
00:21:24,409 --> 00:21:28,163
But l've made you think
you've found a man

270
00:21:28,372 --> 00:21:30,666
sensitive enough to help you...

271
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:33,752
Frasier, l'll learn to love again.

272
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:37,464
- Of course.
- You'll apologise to Daphne?

273
00:21:37,631 --> 00:21:40,676
For the rest of my days.

274
00:21:40,843 --> 00:21:43,387
Does this mean your dad's not gay?

275
00:21:46,098 --> 00:21:48,642
No, Dad's not gay.

276
00:21:49,685 --> 00:21:52,020
But Niles... Come on!

277
00:21:57,651 --> 00:22:00,571
No, l'm afraid not.

278
00:22:00,737 --> 00:22:03,824
So this Maris he kept mentioning
is a woman?

279
00:22:03,991 --> 00:22:06,952
Well, the jury's still out
on that one.

280
00:22:13,667 --> 00:22:18,505
# Hey baby, l hear the blues a-calling
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

281
00:22:18,672 --> 00:22:20,674
# Oh, my!

282
00:22:20,841 --> 00:22:27,890
# And maybe l seem a bit confused
Well, maybe...but l got you pegged!

283
00:22:28,056 --> 00:22:33,896
# But l don't know what to do with those
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

284
00:22:34,062 --> 00:22:36,648
# They're calling again #

285
00:22:36,815 --> 00:22:39,443
Frasier has left the building.
