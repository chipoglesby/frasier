1
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:14,447
Hi, we're back.
We have Chester on the line.

2
00:00:14,614 --> 00:00:16,824
- How can l help you?
- 'l don't know.

3
00:00:17,033 --> 00:00:22,580
'l've had a lot of fights with my wife
lately. She feels l'm wasting my life. '

4
00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:26,334
- Spinning your wheels?
- 'Huh? l don't follow. '

5
00:00:29,962 --> 00:00:34,675
This problem might be too complex
for the few seconds remaining.

6
00:00:34,884 --> 00:00:38,012
Call tomorrow.
l'll make sure you get on first thing.

7
00:00:38,221 --> 00:00:40,973
- 'lt's tough to get through.'
- Tell you what.

8
00:00:41,182 --> 00:00:44,477
When l get off the air,
l'll pick up and try to help.

9
00:00:44,644 --> 00:00:46,896
Take your time.

10
00:00:48,731 --> 00:00:53,986
l've got to scoot. Bulldog's up after
the news with the Gonzo Sports Show

11
00:00:54,153 --> 00:00:57,239
on ''What's wrong
with our Seattle Mariners?''

12
00:00:57,406 --> 00:01:02,119
lf you haven't commented on that
in the last 1 8 years, do it today!

13
00:01:02,328 --> 00:01:04,997
So long, all.

14
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:11,462
- That was a pretty good show.
- Mm-hmm.

15
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:14,423
- What's that?
- ''Seattle Magazine''.

16
00:01:14,632 --> 00:01:17,468
The hottest hundred men
and women in town.

17
00:01:17,676 --> 00:01:19,929
- Let me see!
- What about Chester?

18
00:01:20,095 --> 00:01:22,139
You heard him - he can wait.

19
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:27,561
- You're not in there.
- Oh.

20
00:01:28,854 --> 00:01:32,149
- Niles isn't in there, either.
- Cool!

21
00:01:33,692 --> 00:01:36,945
Oh, my! Who is this fresh angel?

22
00:01:37,112 --> 00:01:42,409
- Madeline Marshall, No 4 7.
- Makes her own line of sportswear.

23
00:01:42,618 --> 00:01:44,620
She's a stunning woman!

24
00:01:44,787 --> 00:01:48,916
''Single, patron of the arts,
MBA at Stanford.''

25
00:01:49,124 --> 00:01:53,337
Well, if you have to go to school
on the West Coast...

26
00:01:54,797 --> 00:01:57,591
''What she looks for most in a man:

27
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:02,596
''someone who knows how to...listen.''

28
00:02:04,223 --> 00:02:06,391
Roz, l'm in love!

29
00:02:06,558 --> 00:02:09,645
- Why don't you ask her out?
- Yeah, right!

30
00:02:09,811 --> 00:02:15,150
- What have you got to lose?
- She doesn't even know who l am.

31
00:02:15,317 --> 00:02:18,904
- You're on the radio.
- Then why am l not in there?

32
00:02:19,112 --> 00:02:21,365
Those are important people.

33
00:02:21,531 --> 00:02:24,284
- l'm going to call her office.
- No!

34
00:02:24,493 --> 00:02:26,495
- Hey, Doc!
- Bulldog.

35
00:02:26,703 --> 00:02:30,540
Just did an hour on the Stairmaster.
What do you think?

36
00:02:30,749 --> 00:02:33,251
Like a couple of cherry tomatoes,
huh?

37
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:39,299
Thank you. You've just
put me off salads for a month.

38
00:02:39,507 --> 00:02:43,219
- What have we got here?
- ls Madeline Marshall there?

39
00:02:43,428 --> 00:02:47,390
- Dr Frasier Crane.
- You know this Madeline Marshall?

40
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:51,519
No. l found her attractive
and Roz insisted on calling her.

41
00:02:51,686 --> 00:02:54,898
Small wonder. Smart, sophisticated...

42
00:02:55,106 --> 00:02:58,026
And l like a woman
who doesn't wear underwear.

43
00:02:58,193 --> 00:03:02,322
- She's wearing a business suit.
- lt was a general comment.

44
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:07,452
Hi. Miss Marshall? Could you
please hold for Dr Crane? Thank you.

45
00:03:09,537 --> 00:03:13,208
Oh, all right.
Once more unto the breach.

46
00:03:17,629 --> 00:03:21,591
Hello. This is Dr Frasier Crane.
l know we've never met,

47
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:25,845
but you seem like a fascinating
person. l was just wondering...

48
00:03:26,054 --> 00:03:31,809
Would you be so good
as to have dinner with me tonight?

49
00:03:31,976 --> 00:03:36,689
That's very gracious of you to accept,
Chester, but l didn't mean you.

50
00:03:38,733 --> 00:03:43,196
- Roz, you could have said line two!
- You could have asked.

51
00:03:46,073 --> 00:03:50,536
Mr Crane, is the proper term
''serial killer'' or ''serial murderer''?

52
00:03:50,745 --> 00:03:55,041
- ''Serial killer''. Why?
- Letting Mum know what's going on.

53
00:03:55,249 --> 00:03:57,418
She worries if she doesn't hear from me.

54
00:03:58,836 --> 00:04:01,839
How about a nice
Havana with that wine?

55
00:04:02,006 --> 00:04:03,841
Thank you!

56
00:04:04,008 --> 00:04:08,054
- Aren't Cuban cigars illegal?
- l've got a friend in Customs.

57
00:04:08,262 --> 00:04:13,517
He confiscated them from a teacher
who ''needed them for a lesson''.

58
00:04:13,684 --> 00:04:18,773
When are people going to learn
that rules apply to everyone?

59
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:25,279
l love to see a man with a cigar.
lt reminds me of my grandfather.

60
00:04:25,446 --> 00:04:30,618
All day, he'd sit with a great big
stogey dangling from his lips.

61
00:04:30,826 --> 00:04:33,537
The hours we used to spend on his lap,

62
00:04:33,704 --> 00:04:37,708
playing with the yellow whiskers
beneath his nose.

63
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:42,254
He'd take out his teeth with
the cigar in them and chase us.

64
00:04:42,421 --> 00:04:46,175
We'd all laugh and laugh.

65
00:04:46,383 --> 00:04:48,886
Then suddenly his mood would change,

66
00:04:49,053 --> 00:04:52,056
and we'd all have to run for our lives.

67
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:55,976
You can't buy memories like that.

68
00:04:58,145 --> 00:05:03,483
Eddie, l know you took the socks
that go with this suit. Where are they?

69
00:05:06,987 --> 00:05:11,116
Brown socks with a blue suit?
l think not. Try again.

70
00:05:14,077 --> 00:05:15,912
Thank you.

71
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:19,333
- Where are you off to?
- He has a blind date.

72
00:05:19,499 --> 00:05:22,502
- Really? With whom?
- Madeline Marshall.

73
00:05:22,669 --> 00:05:26,631
She has her own sportswear concern.
According to ''Seattle Magazine'',

74
00:05:26,798 --> 00:05:29,843
she is the 4 7th hottest person
in Seattle.

75
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:32,137
- That article was a sham.
- Not in it, huh?

76
00:05:32,345 --> 00:05:34,723
Can you believe it?

77
00:05:34,931 --> 00:05:39,394
Well, l'm off. You know,
l have a good feeling about tonight.

78
00:05:39,603 --> 00:05:42,647
l have a song in my heart,
a dance in my step

79
00:05:42,856 --> 00:05:44,983
and dog saliva around my ankles.

80
00:05:57,704 --> 00:05:59,539
Thank you.

81
00:05:59,706 --> 00:06:02,792
This is wonderful!
l've never heard of this place.

82
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:07,839
You're in for a treat. ''Degas'' is the
pinnacle of French country dining.

83
00:06:08,047 --> 00:06:13,011
Ettienne Degas, his wife and daughter,
will treat us like family.

84
00:06:14,971 --> 00:06:18,933
l couldn't help being flattered
when you said you knew my show.

85
00:06:19,142 --> 00:06:21,269
Are you a devoted listener?

86
00:06:21,477 --> 00:06:24,147
Actually, my secretary listens to it

87
00:06:24,314 --> 00:06:28,359
but l try to catch what l can
when l cross through her office.

88
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,739
Bonsoir. Welcome to ''Degas''.

89
00:06:32,905 --> 00:06:37,660
Our special tonight
is our fabulous crispy duck.

90
00:06:37,827 --> 00:06:42,206
Oh, yummy! And a bottle
of Châteauneuf-du-Pape '89.

91
00:06:42,415 --> 00:06:46,377
The only one in that decade
to outdo the '88.

92
00:06:46,586 --> 00:06:49,422
Excellent choice.

93
00:06:51,174 --> 00:06:56,012
- You know wine.
- l acquaint myself with fine things.

94
00:06:56,179 --> 00:06:59,015
What would you like
to know about me?

95
00:06:59,849 --> 00:07:04,186
For starters, why is a man
as charming as you still out there?

96
00:07:04,353 --> 00:07:07,064
Well, actually, l...

97
00:07:07,273 --> 00:07:10,109
- l'm recently divorced.
- Thank goodness.

98
00:07:10,276 --> 00:07:15,364
l thought you were one of those single
men still living with his parents!

99
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:21,954
Yeah. Your heart really has
to go out to those sad sacks.

100
00:07:22,955 --> 00:07:26,709
- l'm divorced also.
- We have so much in common.

101
00:07:26,876 --> 00:07:31,088
- l caught him with my sister.
- Fabulous!

102
00:07:31,297 --> 00:07:36,093
- The same thing happened to me.
- Boy, my sister gets around.

103
00:07:36,302 --> 00:07:38,637
You've kept your sense of humour.

104
00:07:39,722 --> 00:07:42,725
Yeah, but it isn't easy to get over, is it?

105
00:07:42,891 --> 00:07:45,102
No.

106
00:07:45,311 --> 00:07:50,649
No, it's not.
Those nights when you ask yourself,

107
00:07:50,816 --> 00:07:54,778
''How could this have happened?
Was l insensitive?''

108
00:07:54,987 --> 00:07:58,907
- ''Was l a workaholic?''
- ''Was l not good enough in bed?''

109
00:07:59,074 --> 00:08:02,286
You reach for anything.

110
00:08:03,745 --> 00:08:06,039
(Arguing in French)

111
00:08:06,248 --> 00:08:09,168
(Father) What are you telling me?
You are pregnant?

112
00:08:09,334 --> 00:08:11,545
(Daughter)
Maman, l told you he would do this!

113
00:08:11,753 --> 00:08:15,257
(Father)
Who is the father? l want to know!

114
00:08:15,424 --> 00:08:20,012
(Daughter) l won't tell you!
(Father) When l find him, l'll kill him.

115
00:08:20,178 --> 00:08:23,557
(Father) l'll snap his neck
like a stale baguette!

116
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:27,894
- Your wine.
- Yes, that's the one.

117
00:08:28,103 --> 00:08:30,605
l will just go and open it.

118
00:08:30,772 --> 00:08:34,025
- This will be a night to remember.
- Oh, yes.

119
00:08:34,192 --> 00:08:36,278
(Father) Are you going to tell me?
(Daughter) No!

120
00:08:36,445 --> 00:08:39,489
There's a clam house up the road.

121
00:08:39,698 --> 00:08:45,162
No, l think we're getting the most
for our entertainment buck right here.

122
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:48,123
(Mother) What did l ever see in you?

123
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:53,211
(Father) You don't think l'm sick of you?
You and your cuttlefish bisque!

124
00:08:53,378 --> 00:08:56,172
l spit in your cuttlefish bisque!

125
00:08:57,382 --> 00:09:01,845
Voilà. lt's a delicacy
from our little village in France.

126
00:09:02,053 --> 00:09:04,097
Cuttlefish bisque.

127
00:09:08,059 --> 00:09:11,563
What are the odds?
l had cuttlefish for lunch.

128
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:16,484
(Father) You can leave my house,
Yvette! Go to wherever he is!

129
00:09:19,737 --> 00:09:23,658
Are you not the one
who gives advice on the radio?

130
00:09:23,825 --> 00:09:27,579
- You listen to my show?
- No, but my Sous-chef does.

131
00:09:27,745 --> 00:09:30,623
l hear you
as l walk through the kitchen.

132
00:09:30,832 --> 00:09:33,876
Monsieur, you must help me! Ettienne!

133
00:09:35,044 --> 00:09:39,549
lf everyone comes out, how will
you know when our duck is crispy?

134
00:09:39,757 --> 00:09:44,846
- This is the doctor from the radio.
- Ah, oui!

135
00:09:45,013 --> 00:09:47,181
You must talk to my husband.

136
00:09:47,348 --> 00:09:51,352
He does not understand
that these things happen.

137
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:55,648
Talk to this tramp!
Do you believe my daughter?

138
00:09:55,857 --> 00:09:58,192
You should meet my sister.

139
00:09:58,359 --> 00:10:03,823
- l wasn't pregnant when we got married!
- l wish l had been killed in the war!

140
00:10:04,031 --> 00:10:06,951
lt's hard to get killed
when you run away!

141
00:10:09,704 --> 00:10:11,956
Silence! Silence!

142
00:10:15,042 --> 00:10:18,504
Both of you try to calm down.
l'll see what l can do.

143
00:10:18,713 --> 00:10:24,093
Monsieur Degas, you are angry now.
That is a temporary emotion.

144
00:10:24,301 --> 00:10:26,595
You are devastated because you think

145
00:10:26,762 --> 00:10:30,599
the bond between father
and daughter is broken.

146
00:10:30,808 --> 00:10:33,310
She is no longer your little girl.

147
00:10:33,477 --> 00:10:37,690
But that's not possible.
That bond cannot be broken.

148
00:10:37,898 --> 00:10:43,153
Not even by that young man in the
corner who is obviously the father.

149
00:10:45,823 --> 00:10:48,158
Come out! lt's all right.

150
00:10:49,702 --> 00:10:51,745
We need more water.

151
00:10:54,248 --> 00:10:58,794
You? You can't even get water
in a glass! How did you do this?

152
00:11:02,589 --> 00:11:05,342
Monsieur Degas, please.

153
00:11:06,385 --> 00:11:10,430
Hold your daughter in your arms.
Tell her how you really feel.

154
00:11:12,266 --> 00:11:14,142
Yvette...

155
00:11:23,193 --> 00:11:25,904
Thank you, monsieur. Thank you!

156
00:11:28,115 --> 00:11:33,245
You are a god! And you,
mademoiselle, are very lucky.

157
00:11:33,453 --> 00:11:35,539
l'm starting to realise that.

158
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,960
Just another evening out with...

159
00:11:40,127 --> 00:11:42,170
Dr Frasier Crane.

160
00:11:49,386 --> 00:11:50,804
(Door opens)

161
00:11:50,971 --> 00:11:53,014
- Hi, Roz.
- Hey.

162
00:11:53,223 --> 00:11:55,225
Again, thank you.

163
00:11:55,392 --> 00:11:59,604
lt's OK. You've thanked me
every day for the last two weeks.

164
00:11:59,813 --> 00:12:04,150
But if it hadn't been for you,
l never would have met...Madeline.

165
00:12:05,819 --> 00:12:10,949
We went out again last night.
lt's perfect between us! We talk, laugh...

166
00:12:11,157 --> 00:12:16,496
Just stop. Did it ever occur to you
that, since l'm in a dating drought,

167
00:12:16,663 --> 00:12:20,917
to hear you prattling on
about your storybook romance

168
00:12:21,084 --> 00:12:24,504
might be a bit irritating?

169
00:12:24,671 --> 00:12:29,133
No, it hadn't. You're right,
l'm sorry. l can be so insensitive.

170
00:12:29,342 --> 00:12:33,388
But Madeline's helping me with that.
She is so good.

171
00:12:33,596 --> 00:12:35,598
- God!
- Sorry.

172
00:12:35,765 --> 00:12:39,644
l haven't felt this way
since my divorce.

173
00:12:39,852 --> 00:12:41,938
Everything seems so right!

174
00:12:42,105 --> 00:12:46,651
You know, l haven't said this
out loud, but here goes.

175
00:12:46,859 --> 00:12:50,905
She could be the woman
l spend the rest of my life with.

176
00:12:52,031 --> 00:12:57,412
Go. Go do that! Get married.
Have a couple of kids.

177
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:01,207
Move to the country. Buy a puppy.
Live happily ever after!

178
00:13:01,374 --> 00:13:04,877
Just don't tell me about it!
l need a boyfriend.

179
00:13:07,296 --> 00:13:09,549
Dear Roz.
Dear, silly Roz.

180
00:13:09,715 --> 00:13:11,968
Dear, silly, horny Roz.

181
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,181
- Look! lt's...
- That must be Madeline.

182
00:13:18,391 --> 00:13:22,520
Madeline, hi! Hi, Roz, Madeline!
Madeline, Roz!

183
00:13:22,728 --> 00:13:25,231
What a surprise to see you!

184
00:13:25,398 --> 00:13:29,402
l have a meeting with a buyer nearby
in ten minutes

185
00:13:29,568 --> 00:13:31,779
and l wanted to talk to you.

186
00:13:31,987 --> 00:13:33,989
Please, have a seat.

187
00:13:36,492 --> 00:13:42,289
You know we both agreed we didn't
want to rush into the physical part,

188
00:13:42,498 --> 00:13:47,002
that we'd save ourselves
for the right moment.

189
00:13:47,169 --> 00:13:49,213
lt's now?

190
00:13:50,756 --> 00:13:52,800
No, actually.

191
00:13:53,008 --> 00:13:58,055
l was wondering what you thought
about us going away for the weekend,

192
00:13:58,263 --> 00:14:00,265
just the two of us.

193
00:14:00,432 --> 00:14:04,103
Well, l'd miss my favourite shows,
but sure.

194
00:14:05,688 --> 00:14:08,565
l was thinking two, three days.

195
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:17,491
l was thinking more like a week.

196
00:14:19,034 --> 00:14:22,454
OK, now for the really big question:
when?

197
00:14:22,621 --> 00:14:25,165
Well, the minute we get there.

198
00:14:27,793 --> 00:14:32,547
No. Actually, l meant, when do we go?

199
00:14:32,714 --> 00:14:35,759
Oh, oh, yes. Let's see.

200
00:14:35,968 --> 00:14:40,430
Now, let's see, l am good for...
the week of the 1 6th.

201
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,475
The 1 6th... No. Sweeps week.

202
00:14:43,642 --> 00:14:47,813
- How about the 23rd?
- No. No. Trade show. 30th?

203
00:14:47,979 --> 00:14:50,857
- No.
- That puts us into the next month.

204
00:14:51,066 --> 00:14:53,068
No. No. No. The 20th?

205
00:14:53,235 --> 00:14:55,987
No.

206
00:14:56,154 --> 00:14:59,991
We're both obviously too busy.
We'll do it another time.

207
00:15:00,158 --> 00:15:02,202
- Yes, l...
- l've got to run.

208
00:15:09,834 --> 00:15:11,920
- Let's go tomorrow!
- You're on!

209
00:15:12,087 --> 00:15:15,715
- The perfect place is Bora Bora.
- Hubba hubba!

210
00:15:15,924 --> 00:15:19,594
- l'll arrange it!
- l'll meet you at the airport!

211
00:15:19,761 --> 00:15:22,430
- Bye!
- Bye. Oh, Madeline...

212
00:15:23,431 --> 00:15:25,517
Bye.

213
00:15:27,185 --> 00:15:32,982
Hello. You don't know me, but l saw
your picture in ''Seattle Magazine''.

214
00:15:37,028 --> 00:15:39,072
(Up-tempo tune )

215
00:15:48,623 --> 00:15:51,167
They don't write
songs like that any more.

216
00:15:51,376 --> 00:15:54,379
This is really what men do,
isn't it, Dad?

217
00:15:55,713 --> 00:16:00,551
Yeah, this and some things outdoors,
but we'll just stick to this.

218
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:04,597
These last few nights
have been very pleasant,

219
00:16:04,806 --> 00:16:09,310
you and me sitting together,
appreciating these fine cigars.

220
00:16:09,477 --> 00:16:12,396
Who would have thought
a Cuban peasant

221
00:16:12,563 --> 00:16:15,399
would bring a father and son together?

222
00:16:15,566 --> 00:16:20,571
Yes. Must make that dime he gets
for a day's work a lot more satisfying.

223
00:16:25,493 --> 00:16:28,954
l'm going to miss
these little sweethearts.

224
00:16:31,248 --> 00:16:34,752
- Ooh, now, there's a talent!
- l'll say!

225
00:16:39,673 --> 00:16:44,595
- Just how do you do that?
- lt's simple. lt's all in the tongue.

226
00:16:44,762 --> 00:16:49,141
Just purse your lips
and pucker up like a little goldfish.

227
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:52,144
That's it. Just like that. Very good.

228
00:16:53,687 --> 00:16:55,731
Have you got it?

229
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:05,032
- Niles, what are you doing?
- l'm learning how to blow smoke.

230
00:17:05,866 --> 00:17:07,701
Where?

231
00:17:11,288 --> 00:17:14,833
- l asked you to smoke on the balcony.
- lt's cold.

232
00:17:15,042 --> 00:17:19,922
All right. Maybe an errant ash
will flick off and ignite your chair.

233
00:17:21,381 --> 00:17:23,425
What's the matter?

234
00:17:23,634 --> 00:17:25,928
Madeline and l are going
to Bora Bora.

235
00:17:26,136 --> 00:17:29,556
Why do bad things
happen to good people?

236
00:17:30,641 --> 00:17:35,062
- When did this come about?
- About an hour ago.

237
00:17:35,228 --> 00:17:37,272
We got caught up
in a moment of passion

238
00:17:37,481 --> 00:17:40,817
and now l'm going halfway around
the world with a woman l hardly know.

239
00:17:40,984 --> 00:17:43,945
lt isn't like me.
l'm getting caught up in the romance.

240
00:17:44,154 --> 00:17:49,201
l'm not sure about the psychological
side, but it seems good to me.

241
00:17:49,409 --> 00:17:53,288
But what if we hate each other
and we're stuck together?

242
00:17:53,455 --> 00:17:57,209
That won't happen.
You'll come back even more in love.

243
00:17:57,375 --> 00:18:02,631
Even worse! lf it goes perfectly,
we'll start talking about commitment

244
00:18:02,839 --> 00:18:05,258
and living together
and marriage and...

245
00:18:05,467 --> 00:18:08,261
Your trepidation is well founded.

246
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:12,974
You can move a relationship along
too fast and marry too hastily

247
00:18:13,141 --> 00:18:17,145
and then find a few years down
the line she isn't right for you.

248
00:18:17,312 --> 00:18:21,608
Then what happens
if you meet the right person?

249
00:18:21,775 --> 00:18:23,860
You can't act upon it

250
00:18:24,027 --> 00:18:27,697
because you're trapped
in a stale Maris.

251
00:18:33,369 --> 00:18:35,121
Marriage.

252
00:18:36,706 --> 00:18:38,708
l have to go now.

253
00:18:43,546 --> 00:18:47,467
Did you feel a spark
when you met this woman?

254
00:18:48,885 --> 00:18:51,012
- Like fireworks.
- Then go for it.

255
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:56,476
lt doesn't happen often. lt's like when
l met your mother at a crime scene.

256
00:18:56,643 --> 00:18:58,686
Hester was a psychiatrist.

257
00:18:58,895 --> 00:19:03,191
The department would have her
run up a profile of a suspect.

258
00:19:03,399 --> 00:19:08,362
The first time l met her was over
the chalk outline of a murder victim.

259
00:19:08,529 --> 00:19:10,615
One look at her hair

260
00:19:10,823 --> 00:19:15,161
silhouetted against the flashing
blue light and l was a goner.

261
00:19:15,328 --> 00:19:20,166
She drew a smile on the head
of the outline and l drew eyes

262
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:23,252
and soon we were laughing like kids.

263
00:19:23,419 --> 00:19:25,463
You're a ghoul.

264
00:19:26,505 --> 00:19:31,844
l was joking. We couldn't draw on the
outline. They hadn't moved the body.

265
00:19:32,678 --> 00:19:36,390
Your corpse-strewn romance
notwithstanding,

266
00:19:36,557 --> 00:19:39,101
l still feel skittish about this.

267
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:43,022
Dr Crane, if you'd like
a feminine point of view,

268
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:46,650
just shut your bloody cakehole
and go!

269
00:19:46,859 --> 00:19:51,489
You took a chance and called her,
and you've been happy ever since.

270
00:19:51,697 --> 00:19:56,327
- That is true.
- Yeah, so make another bold move.

271
00:19:56,493 --> 00:19:59,288
- Yeah, go on!
- You won't regret it.

272
00:20:00,206 --> 00:20:04,501
- All right, l'll do it.
- Attaboy! That's terrific!

273
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:08,380
l know you just want me
out of the house for a week.

274
00:20:08,547 --> 00:20:11,633
lt will be sweet, won't it?

275
00:20:23,228 --> 00:20:25,272
Thank you.

276
00:20:27,733 --> 00:20:31,487
This is gorgeous!
l'm so glad you suggested it.

277
00:20:31,653 --> 00:20:34,406
lt's more beautiful than l remember.

278
00:20:34,573 --> 00:20:39,661
The natives say that Bora Bora
is the doorway to heaven.

279
00:20:39,828 --> 00:20:44,333
This...could be
the doorway to heaven for us.

280
00:20:47,419 --> 00:20:49,463
l'm glad you said that first.

281
00:20:49,671 --> 00:20:53,300
l didn't want it to seem like
our trip was just about sex,

282
00:20:53,467 --> 00:20:56,053
but...who are we kidding?

283
00:21:04,936 --> 00:21:09,649
- l'm a little hot in these clothes.
- l'm sweating like a pig.

284
00:21:11,526 --> 00:21:13,737
- l'll be right back.
- Oink.

285
00:21:38,553 --> 00:21:41,055
(Madeline ) Frasier.

286
00:21:46,978 --> 00:21:50,648
- Oh, my God.
- Frasier?

287
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:54,444
Oh, my God!

288
00:22:05,538 --> 00:22:10,668
# Hey baby, l hear the blues are calling
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

289
00:22:10,835 --> 00:22:12,545
# Mercy!

290
00:22:12,712 --> 00:22:17,717
# And maybe l seem a bit confused
Yeah, maybe, but l got you pegged

291
00:22:19,677 --> 00:22:24,724
# But l don't know what to do with those
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

292
00:22:26,642 --> 00:22:28,895
# They're calling again

293
00:22:29,103 --> 00:22:32,231
# Scrambled egg's all over my face!

294
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:35,901
# What is a boy to do? #

295
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:39,447
Good night everybody!
