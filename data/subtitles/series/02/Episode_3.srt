1
00:00:10,009 --> 00:00:14,347
- Time for one last call. Who's next?
- Elliott, on line three.

2
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:18,142
Hello, Elliott. l'm listening.

3
00:00:18,309 --> 00:00:21,645
(Child's voice ) 'l'm a salesman...'

4
00:00:21,812 --> 00:00:24,648
A salesman?! How old are you?

5
00:00:24,815 --> 00:00:27,610
- '43. '
- 43?

6
00:00:27,777 --> 00:00:31,489
- 'Yeah. '
- Let's be truthful.

7
00:00:31,655 --> 00:00:33,699
'l'm 43. '

8
00:00:34,617 --> 00:00:37,495
Elliott, we weren't born yesterday.

9
00:00:37,661 --> 00:00:41,707
You're an adolescent trying
to be clever by getting on air,

10
00:00:41,874 --> 00:00:45,377
but you're taking time
from people with real problems.

11
00:00:45,586 --> 00:00:50,007
'Hey, l'm 43. My problem is,
l have a young-sounding voice

12
00:00:50,174 --> 00:00:53,052
'that people make fun of all the time. '

13
00:00:56,555 --> 00:01:01,518
Oh, l...l'm so sorry, Elliott.
That was very insensitive of me.

14
00:01:01,685 --> 00:01:03,729
'Gotcha, Dr Dufus! '

15
00:01:11,028 --> 00:01:13,572
lndeed you did get us, Elliott.

16
00:01:13,739 --> 00:01:18,160
But we're not so stuffy
that we can't laugh at ourselves.

17
00:01:18,327 --> 00:01:21,914
Roz, keep these pimply-faced maggots
off the air!

18
00:01:22,998 --> 00:01:25,125
Well, that's our show for today.

19
00:01:25,292 --> 00:01:29,963
This is Dr Crane signing off
and wishing you good mental health.

20
00:01:33,091 --> 00:01:35,510
- Have a good weekend.
- Wait.

21
00:01:35,677 --> 00:01:39,222
l want an honest answer to a question.

22
00:01:39,389 --> 00:01:42,267
No, that outfit
does not make you look fat.

23
00:01:42,434 --> 00:01:45,353
That's not it. Why would you think so?

24
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,024
Women usually begin that question with
''l want an honest answer''.

25
00:01:49,191 --> 00:01:51,318
l'm not that insecure.

26
00:01:51,484 --> 00:01:54,237
Sorry. You're right. Your question?

27
00:01:54,404 --> 00:01:57,532
ls the back of my head unattractive?

28
00:01:59,868 --> 00:02:02,537
- Have you lost your mind?
- l'm serious.

29
00:02:02,704 --> 00:02:05,123
You know l have season tickets
for the Seahawks?

30
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:07,375
Well, this cute guy sits behind me.

31
00:02:07,542 --> 00:02:11,880
A few weeks ago, we said ''hi'',
but he hasn't asked me out.

32
00:02:12,047 --> 00:02:15,759
So l thought
the back of my head might be weird.

33
00:02:15,925 --> 00:02:19,637
There could be hundreds of reasons
he hasn't asked.

34
00:02:19,804 --> 00:02:22,098
That makes me feel better!

35
00:02:22,265 --> 00:02:25,435
Maybe he's married, maybe he's gay.

36
00:02:25,602 --> 00:02:29,731
Or maybe he's there to watch football
and not cruise chicks.

37
00:02:30,815 --> 00:02:33,318
You're right. l'm being ridiculous.

38
00:02:33,484 --> 00:02:35,820
- Of course. See you Monday.
- All right.

39
00:02:35,987 --> 00:02:38,031
l saw that! Wait!

40
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:52,503
You're not getting the rest of my scone
so forget it.

41
00:02:55,965 --> 00:02:58,009
Mmm. lt's really good.

42
00:03:00,052 --> 00:03:02,138
Mmm, yum, yum, yum.

43
00:03:03,723 --> 00:03:07,143
You can sit there
till you're blue in the face.

44
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:10,646
As far as l'm concerned
you don't exist.

45
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,945
Oh, all right! Here! Get fat!

46
00:03:20,698 --> 00:03:23,492
He got you again? You're a soft touch.

47
00:03:23,659 --> 00:03:26,162
- l am not.
- He never begs with me.

48
00:03:26,328 --> 00:03:31,125
- Maybe he doesn't like what you eat.
- He's not picky. He eats beetles.

49
00:03:32,293 --> 00:03:35,171
Eddie! Let's go for another walk.

50
00:03:35,337 --> 00:03:38,924
- l thought you walked him today.
- l did. Twice.

51
00:03:39,091 --> 00:03:41,427
- He's got to go again?
- No. l do.

52
00:03:43,012 --> 00:03:48,392
That didn't sound right.
There's a nice-looking man with a dog.

53
00:03:48,559 --> 00:03:50,978
We want to run into them again.

54
00:03:51,145 --> 00:03:53,939
Come on, Eddie.
He's playing hard to get.

55
00:03:54,106 --> 00:03:56,775
l'm glad somebody is.

56
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:03,991
Will you fix the toilet? lt's running.
The noise drives me crazy.

57
00:04:04,158 --> 00:04:07,703
- l'll call a plumber.
- You've got hands. Fix it yourself.

58
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:09,413
(Doorbell rings)

59
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,874
l am a doctor.

60
00:04:12,749 --> 00:04:16,211
l've more important things
to do than that.

61
00:04:17,337 --> 00:04:19,673
- Hello, Niles.
- Good news.

62
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,343
We're having a salt glow
with our massage.

63
00:04:25,304 --> 00:04:30,434
Forget about the plumber. l'll do it.
My manicurist cancelled on me.

64
00:04:31,518 --> 00:04:35,022
- You will not.
- l bet you don't have any tools.

65
00:04:35,188 --> 00:04:37,899
You're wrong.
Let me show you something.

66
00:04:38,775 --> 00:04:42,738
See this? Every possible tool
for every possible need.

67
00:04:43,655 --> 00:04:45,699
l got it from Hammacher Schlemmer.

68
00:04:45,866 --> 00:04:51,079
- ls that turquoise inlay?
- Yes. lt also comes in ebony and onyx.

69
00:04:51,246 --> 00:04:56,168
- Onyx is so showy.
- l love onyx. lt resonates within me.

70
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:00,255
This is why l never took
any home movies.

71
00:05:00,422 --> 00:05:04,509
Do you two realise
what delicate doilies you are?

72
00:05:05,844 --> 00:05:09,264
You don't know the meaning
of the word ''self-reliant''.

73
00:05:09,431 --> 00:05:12,309
Thank God
there's no disaster happening.

74
00:05:12,517 --> 00:05:15,937
- Oh, oh! A lemon zester.
- Yes.

75
00:05:20,316 --> 00:05:22,610
You know, Niles...

76
00:05:22,777 --> 00:05:27,073
l'd actually like to fix that toilet
just to prove Dad wrong.

77
00:05:28,116 --> 00:05:30,160
For the genetically superior,

78
00:05:30,326 --> 00:05:33,580
the last challenge of a toilet
should be how to use one.

79
00:05:33,746 --> 00:05:39,627
We've conquered the intellectual world
but with nuts and bolts, we need help.

80
00:05:39,794 --> 00:05:42,714
- You're serious?
- Yes. We'll fix it.

81
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,466
Good experience, and it'll shut Dad up.

82
00:05:46,301 --> 00:05:49,345
- We'll show him we're tough.
- Exactly.

83
00:05:49,512 --> 00:05:52,557
We can let the eucalyptus wrap
be our reward.

84
00:05:59,397 --> 00:06:03,109
Maris, l'm afraid l'll be delayed
a few hours.

85
00:06:03,276 --> 00:06:06,571
Frasier and l are tackling
a home repair.

86
00:06:06,737 --> 00:06:09,240
Yes, l'm working with my hands.

87
00:06:10,575 --> 00:06:13,369
Yes, l've worked up a bit of a sweat.

88
00:06:14,787 --> 00:06:17,373
l suppose l could take my shirt off.

89
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:22,169
- What are you doing?
- She's aroused by my manual labour.

90
00:06:23,713 --> 00:06:27,758
Maris,
l'm holding some sort of a wrench.

91
00:06:28,843 --> 00:06:31,053
Give me that!

92
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:35,891
Hello, Maris. Niles is busy now.
Never mind what l'm wearing!

93
00:06:38,811 --> 00:06:41,063
- May we continue?
- Fine.

94
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:45,609
Take the ball cock assembly,
thread it through the tank hole

95
00:06:45,776 --> 00:06:49,572
and fasten it under the tank
with a locknut.

96
00:06:49,738 --> 00:06:54,577
Yes, locknut. See Niles? Till today
you didn't know what a locknut was.

97
00:06:54,743 --> 00:06:57,746
That Niles is dead. Call me Dutch.

98
00:06:59,999 --> 00:07:02,918
Working with our hands like this,

99
00:07:03,085 --> 00:07:08,382
l'm reminded of that glorious tradition
of the Amish barn raising.

100
00:07:08,549 --> 00:07:13,429
All the men of the village
coming together, the mind, the muscle,

101
00:07:13,595 --> 00:07:18,267
all toward that one simple
yet extraordinary goal.

102
00:07:21,311 --> 00:07:24,690
All right. We are ready to flush.

103
00:07:29,111 --> 00:07:34,074
Here's to what we accomplish
when we put our minds to it. Flush away!

104
00:07:38,996 --> 00:07:43,959
lt's working! Oh, my God! lt's draining
out of the tank into the bowl.

105
00:07:44,126 --> 00:07:49,381
Filling the tank. l've seen it so often
but never has it meant so much.

106
00:07:49,548 --> 00:07:51,842
- Shouldn't it stop now?
- Yes.

107
00:07:52,008 --> 00:07:55,720
- lt's overflowing.
- Oh, oh, oh! Oh, God!

108
00:07:55,887 --> 00:07:58,932
- What does it say to do now?
- Nothing.

109
00:07:59,099 --> 00:08:01,518
Where are your Amish friends now?

110
00:08:04,646 --> 00:08:11,069
The plumber's been called. The wine's
chilled. My world makes sense again.

111
00:08:12,904 --> 00:08:14,948
We've had a tough day.

112
00:08:15,115 --> 00:08:18,451
We've tangled with
a little pipe and porcelain.

113
00:08:18,618 --> 00:08:21,246
Now it's Montrachet time.

114
00:08:29,212 --> 00:08:32,048
We made a mistake in trying to fix it.

115
00:08:32,215 --> 00:08:36,052
Yes. We tampered with
the natural order of things.

116
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,431
But now, order has been restored.

117
00:08:40,598 --> 00:08:45,395
By hiring a plumber, that plumber
can buy, say, a Dolly Parton album.

118
00:08:47,897 --> 00:08:52,068
Miss Parton finances a tour,
allowing a local promoter

119
00:08:52,235 --> 00:08:57,824
to afford to send his cross-dressing
son to us for $1 50-an-hour therapy.

120
00:09:03,121 --> 00:09:05,164
To the circle of life!

121
00:09:06,082 --> 00:09:07,500
(Doorbell)

122
00:09:07,667 --> 00:09:09,669
Must be the plumber.

123
00:09:09,836 --> 00:09:13,422
Are you answering it
or hiring someone to?

124
00:09:13,589 --> 00:09:15,591
Dad, we tried, OK?

125
00:09:15,758 --> 00:09:16,759
(Doorbell)

126
00:09:16,926 --> 00:09:20,638
Oh, please, l wasn't doing anything.
Let me get it.

127
00:09:22,515 --> 00:09:25,226
- Somebody call a plumber?
- Not soon enough.

128
00:09:25,393 --> 00:09:27,478
Follow me.

129
00:09:27,645 --> 00:09:32,650
- Nice way to spend an afternoon!
- We're psychiatrists, not plumbers.

130
00:09:32,817 --> 00:09:35,903
Some heads you shouldn't tamper with.

131
00:09:43,536 --> 00:09:46,997
- You've got to get him out of here.
- What?

132
00:09:47,164 --> 00:09:50,709
That man is not fit to touch your toilet.

133
00:09:50,876 --> 00:09:54,421
Niles, have you been
self-medicating again?

134
00:09:56,757 --> 00:10:01,011
- That was Danny Kriezel.
- Kriezel the weasel?

135
00:10:01,178 --> 00:10:03,973
How can you be sure?
lt's been 25 years.

136
00:10:04,139 --> 00:10:07,726
l'd know him anywhere.
He bullied me all my childhood.

137
00:10:09,144 --> 00:10:11,522
He didn't recognise you.

138
00:10:11,689 --> 00:10:14,942
Because he wasn't
flushing my head in a toilet.

139
00:10:15,859 --> 00:10:19,029
That was his trademark.
He called it a swirly.

140
00:10:20,739 --> 00:10:23,617
l remember the Kriezel reign of terror.

141
00:10:23,784 --> 00:10:26,829
l can trace my fear of confined spaces

142
00:10:26,995 --> 00:10:31,583
back to when his older brother, Billy,
shoved me into a locker

143
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:35,379
for wearing a girl's field hockey uniform.

144
00:10:36,755 --> 00:10:40,676
- l didn't mean to deny you your pain.
- Thank you.

145
00:10:40,842 --> 00:10:45,806
l can hear Kriezel's mocking voice
as he hoisted me over the bowl.

146
00:10:45,973 --> 00:10:48,350
''Hold your breath, jocko.''

147
00:10:49,393 --> 00:10:52,062
The crowd would start its awful chant.

148
00:10:52,229 --> 00:10:55,816
''There goes Crane, down the drain.
There goes Crane...''

149
00:10:55,982 --> 00:10:58,610
Niles, stop! Niles! Niles!

150
00:10:58,777 --> 00:11:01,446
Get a hold of yourself! Stop it!

151
00:11:05,033 --> 00:11:08,620
You're a renowned psychiatrist now.

152
00:11:08,787 --> 00:11:13,917
Kriezel won the battle in junior high,
but that's where he peaked.

153
00:11:14,084 --> 00:11:17,170
You won the war.
You know the expression:

154
00:11:17,337 --> 00:11:20,882
- ''Living well is the best revenge.''
- Wonderful.

155
00:11:21,049 --> 00:11:23,802
l just don't know how true it is.

156
00:11:23,969 --> 00:11:27,972
You don't see it turning up
in a lot of opera plots.

157
00:11:30,266 --> 00:11:32,894
Ludwig, maddened
by the poisoning of his family,

158
00:11:33,061 --> 00:11:36,439
wreaks vengeance in the third act
by living well.

159
00:11:37,649 --> 00:11:39,692
All right, Niles.

160
00:11:39,859 --> 00:11:44,113
Then Wotan wreaks vengeance
by living even better than the Duke.

161
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,574
Oh, all right!

162
00:11:50,453 --> 00:11:53,790
- That's a new part, right?
- Yeah.

163
00:11:53,957 --> 00:11:57,335
l'm sure you're charging me
for a new part

164
00:11:57,502 --> 00:12:00,380
so l wouldn't want a used part.

165
00:12:00,546 --> 00:12:03,299
What are you, the plumbing police?

166
00:12:04,676 --> 00:12:06,719
l'll be back.

167
00:12:16,521 --> 00:12:21,400
Don't mind me. l came for an aspirin.
Tannic acid gives me a headache.

168
00:12:21,567 --> 00:12:26,113
But that's the price l pay
for drinking expensive wine.

169
00:12:30,534 --> 00:12:32,954
- Hey.
- Yes?

170
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:38,334
You've got a real mess here.
My partner will have to bring new parts.

171
00:12:38,501 --> 00:12:42,963
- That's two guys on golden time. OK?
- lt's only money.

172
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:48,052
Say, has somebody been trying
to fix this thing?

173
00:12:48,219 --> 00:12:50,346
Not me.

174
00:12:50,513 --> 00:12:54,183
l don't even set the clock
in my Mercedes E320.

175
00:12:56,185 --> 00:13:01,106
- Boy! That's a nice car.
- Yes. l should say it is.

176
00:13:01,673 --> 00:13:03,884
l had one for a while.

177
00:13:04,051 --> 00:13:08,889
But it was too small for the family
so we upgraded to the S-class.

178
00:13:09,806 --> 00:13:12,184
You have the big Mercedes?

179
00:13:13,101 --> 00:13:18,523
Yeah, and l've got to tell you, my
1 3-year-old's already got his eye on it.

180
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:23,111
He's a great kid.
Except he got in a fight the other day.

181
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:28,492
Really? Some small-boned child
with superior language skills?

182
00:13:28,658 --> 00:13:30,493
No!

183
00:13:34,122 --> 00:13:37,334
A big jerk who tried
to steal his lunch money.

184
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:41,171
Oh.
Well, there's nothing like a bully.

185
00:13:41,338 --> 00:13:45,884
l've got to tell you,
l'd rather he'd be a bully

186
00:13:46,051 --> 00:13:50,013
than a wussy kid that gets picked on,
you know the kind?

187
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:55,727
- Kids too gutless to fight back.
- You admire those who fight back?

188
00:13:55,894 --> 00:13:58,062
Well, sure. l mean...

189
00:13:59,272 --> 00:14:04,068
lf you don't fight back, what are you?
You're a wuss, a wimp.

190
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:07,322
- You're a...
- Stop!

191
00:14:07,488 --> 00:14:10,825
Niles! Leave the man alone.
He's trying to work.

192
00:14:21,252 --> 00:14:23,796
What's Dr Crane doing?

193
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:28,342
He's frustrated because
l wouldn't let him do something.

194
00:14:28,509 --> 00:14:31,262
He's taking his anger out
on my ficus.

195
00:14:32,221 --> 00:14:35,683
l've never seen him so angry.
He's like a madman.

196
00:14:38,436 --> 00:14:42,815
Good Lord! There's a bee out there
the size of a wood finch.

197
00:14:45,568 --> 00:14:47,778
Are you ready to talk now?

198
00:14:47,945 --> 00:14:50,031
No. l'm not ready yet.

199
00:14:55,328 --> 00:14:59,874
Niles, l have to be honest.
l'm a little disappointed in you.

200
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:05,046
Were you actually going to stick
someone's head into a toilet?

201
00:15:05,212 --> 00:15:07,465
You don't seem to understand.

202
00:15:07,631 --> 00:15:10,634
This beast
has been awakened within me.

203
00:15:10,801 --> 00:15:13,012
Can you get that for me?

204
00:15:15,389 --> 00:15:19,268
Niles, there is a beast in all of us.

205
00:15:19,435 --> 00:15:23,189
Part of becoming an adult
is learning to control it.

206
00:15:23,355 --> 00:15:26,025
That separates us from the Kriezels.

207
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:30,654
Also their tendency to squat down
and groom each other.

208
00:15:30,821 --> 00:15:35,826
You have an opportunity with Danny
l've never had with Billy.

209
00:15:35,993 --> 00:15:40,205
To confront him as a rational adult
and achieve closure.

210
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:44,668
Easier said than done.
One look at that oafish face,

211
00:15:44,835 --> 00:15:49,840
those dead Kriezel eyes, you see
there's no chance for communication.

212
00:15:50,007 --> 00:15:52,676
There is, Niles. There has to be.

213
00:15:52,843 --> 00:15:57,014
l can't go in. lf he turns his back
on me, l'll attack him.

214
00:15:57,181 --> 00:16:00,267
No, you won't.
You're not a child any more.

215
00:16:00,434 --> 00:16:03,770
Come with me.
l'm taking you to the bathroom.

216
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:12,237
Excuse me, sir.

217
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:16,658
- l'd like to have a word with you.
- Yeah. Go ahead.

218
00:16:16,825 --> 00:16:20,412
l'd like to take you back in time
to the 1 970s.

219
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:24,124
There was a gifted student
at John Adams Junior High.

220
00:16:25,167 --> 00:16:28,003
You terrorised that student

221
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:31,173
simply because he was different
from you.

222
00:16:31,339 --> 00:16:33,508
- lt was l.
- No kidding?

223
00:16:33,675 --> 00:16:38,430
Could we step into the living room
and reach an understanding?

224
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:43,351
lt's OK with me. Any room
in the house is still $59 an hour.

225
00:16:46,521 --> 00:16:48,982
l'll be right back, Billy.

226
00:16:57,157 --> 00:16:59,034
Billy?

227
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:03,037
That's my brother for you.
Always getting into stuff.

228
00:17:03,204 --> 00:17:07,584
But your friend's getting
all worked up over nothing.

229
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:12,046
- You think so, Billy?
- Kids pick on other kids.

230
00:17:12,213 --> 00:17:16,134
- lt made those weak kids tougher.
- Really?

231
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:21,139
You're a big guy.
You must have been involved in stuff.

232
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:24,058
Oh, l was involved.

233
00:17:27,979 --> 00:17:31,733
Billy, l'd like to take you back in time.

234
00:17:31,899 --> 00:17:35,319
No. Let me take you back.

235
00:17:35,486 --> 00:17:39,741
l remember once, we jammed
this poindexter into a locker

236
00:17:39,907 --> 00:17:42,535
wearing a girl's hockey uniform.

237
00:17:46,455 --> 00:17:50,376
No, l'm sorry.
l just don't remember you.

238
00:17:50,543 --> 00:17:53,588
Perhaps you'll remember
third period gym class?

239
00:17:53,754 --> 00:17:56,841
You made me wear my jockstrap
like a tiara.

240
00:17:58,384 --> 00:18:01,220
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

241
00:18:01,387 --> 00:18:06,809
Were you the kid who used to carry
his gym shorts in an attaché case?

242
00:18:12,898 --> 00:18:15,359
lt was a valise.

243
00:18:16,485 --> 00:18:21,073
l remember you.
Boy, those were some crazy times.

244
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:26,078
- Do you ever see any of the old gang?
- You're missing the point.

245
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:30,165
l was severely scarred
by those experiences.

246
00:18:30,332 --> 00:18:34,962
Wait. l can't defend everything
l did in junior high. Who can?

247
00:18:35,129 --> 00:18:40,301
But let's face it: you show up wearing
a tweed blazer with elbow patches,

248
00:18:40,467 --> 00:18:45,472
and carrying a valise,
l mean, l think the guilt here is 50-50.

249
00:18:48,976 --> 00:18:52,479
He's yelling about repressed tendencies

250
00:18:52,646 --> 00:18:57,443
so we stuffed a fire extinguisher
down his pants. We called it...

251
00:18:57,609 --> 00:19:00,112
- A jet pack.
- That's it!

252
00:19:01,405 --> 00:19:03,866
Man, you remember them all.

253
00:19:04,032 --> 00:19:08,370
My next question is
why did you behave this way?

254
00:19:09,538 --> 00:19:14,334
l don't know. l mean, l guess
because people thought it was funny.

255
00:19:14,501 --> 00:19:18,922
l see. So, to get this validation,
you would, say,

256
00:19:19,089 --> 00:19:23,427
squeeze my head between your ankles
and hop around the lunchroom?

257
00:19:25,012 --> 00:19:27,764
- l did that to you?
- Yes.

258
00:19:27,931 --> 00:19:30,642
How does that make you feel?

259
00:19:31,726 --> 00:19:33,770
Well, kind of bad.

260
00:19:36,106 --> 00:19:38,525
The healing has begun.

261
00:19:39,693 --> 00:19:42,445
On the bus, we pantsed him.

262
00:19:42,612 --> 00:19:45,907
He's yelling,
''Give me back my pants!''

263
00:19:46,074 --> 00:19:49,327
But, whoops! They fell out the window.

264
00:19:50,745 --> 00:19:55,959
So the aggressive acts were misplaced
outbursts aimed at your father.

265
00:19:56,126 --> 00:19:58,169
Yes.

266
00:19:59,629 --> 00:20:01,965
He was the real bully, wasn't he?

267
00:20:02,132 --> 00:20:06,511
- Oh, yes.
- Let it out, Danny.

268
00:20:06,678 --> 00:20:09,973
Nothing l ever did
was good enough for him.

269
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:13,518
l am so sorry
that l picked on you, man.

270
00:20:14,936 --> 00:20:19,732
l just wanted to be good at something
and l was good at that.

271
00:20:21,901 --> 00:20:24,070
You were the best.

272
00:20:24,237 --> 00:20:29,325
Then we made him dance the hula
in his underwear in front of the girls.

273
00:20:31,869 --> 00:20:36,040
- You should have been there.
- l was there!

274
00:20:36,207 --> 00:20:41,587
- Thanks. This has just been terrific.
- l can't take all the credit.

275
00:20:41,754 --> 00:20:46,592
My brother convinced me a civilised
person can work anything out

276
00:20:46,759 --> 00:20:49,512
as long as he's calm and rational.

277
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,890
Run, Niles, run! The beast is loose!

278
00:21:02,525 --> 00:21:07,488
- You really shoved his head in here?
- l don't know. lt's all a blur.

279
00:21:07,655 --> 00:21:09,740
l guess l just lost control.

280
00:21:09,907 --> 00:21:13,411
- l bet it felt good, though, didn't it?
- No.

281
00:21:13,577 --> 00:21:15,830
lt felt damned good!

282
00:21:17,123 --> 00:21:21,877
Pity you didn't do it 20 years ago.
You'd have given him a better swirly.

283
00:21:22,044 --> 00:21:27,091
These low-flow toilets don't have
the same velocity as the old ones.

284
00:21:28,008 --> 00:21:31,095
- What did he do to you?
- Not a thing.

285
00:21:31,262 --> 00:21:36,225
- You paid him off?
- l've never written a cheque so fast.

286
00:21:37,434 --> 00:21:39,270
Well...

287
00:21:40,104 --> 00:21:42,481
There she goes. Good as new.

288
00:21:42,648 --> 00:21:46,485
- Thanks. Can l buy you a beer?
- Yeah, sounds good.

289
00:21:49,947 --> 00:21:51,990
Come on, Eddie.

290
00:21:53,992 --> 00:21:57,704
Oh, for God's sake, Eddie,
don't drink out of the toilet.

291
00:21:57,871 --> 00:22:00,582
Some guy
just had his head in there.

292
00:22:05,712 --> 00:22:10,676
# Hey baby, l hear the blues are calling
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

293
00:22:10,843 --> 00:22:12,719
# Mercy!

294
00:22:12,886 --> 00:22:19,643
# And maybe l seem a bit confused
Yeah, maybe...but l got you pegged!

295
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:26,650
# But l don't know what to do with those
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

296
00:22:26,817 --> 00:22:28,985
# They're calling again

297
00:22:29,152 --> 00:22:32,155
# Scrambled egg's all over my face!

298
00:22:32,322 --> 00:22:36,284
# What is a boy to do? #

299
00:22:36,451 --> 00:22:39,955
Good night, Seattle, we love you!
