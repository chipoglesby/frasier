1
00:00:08,074 --> 00:00:10,076
I suppose you looked
in the classifieds

2
00:00:10,076 --> 00:00:11,578
under "housekeepers."
Check.

3
00:00:11,578 --> 00:00:13,046
And you asked people
in your building?
Check.

4
00:00:13,446 --> 00:00:15,248
And you called
the employment agencies?

5
00:00:15,248 --> 00:00:16,316
Again, check.

6
00:00:16,316 --> 00:00:17,784
I heard you
the first time.

7
00:00:19,819 --> 00:00:21,121
Well...

8
00:00:21,388 --> 00:00:22,455
Who'd have thought
it'd be so hard

9
00:00:22,956 --> 00:00:24,457
to get someone
to clean your house?
Well..
.

10
00:00:24,457 --> 00:00:26,960
over the years
Daphne has managed to scour

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,462
her way into our heart,
so to speak.

12
00:00:29,462 --> 00:00:31,898
Just don't want to hire somebo
who's in it for only the money
.

13
00:00:32,298 --> 00:00:34,367
So you want to find someone
who's in it

14
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:36,169
for the joy of cleaning?

15
00:00:36,403 --> 00:00:38,471
Ah. May I?

16
00:00:38,471 --> 00:00:39,472
Oh, of course, Gil.

17
00:00:39,472 --> 00:00:40,473
Take a load off.

18
00:00:40,473 --> 00:00:41,474
Nice outfit, Roz.

19
00:00:41,975 --> 00:00:44,244
Somehow, you and a peasant
blouse just go together.

20
00:00:44,477 --> 00:00:45,945
Thanks.

21
00:00:46,279 --> 00:00:47,847
Haven't worn it
for years.

22
00:00:47,847 --> 00:00:50,817
But how long can something
stay in the closet?

23
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:57,457
Say, uh, Gil...

24
00:00:57,957 --> 00:00:59,759
uh, are you pleased
with your housekeeper?

25
00:00:59,959 --> 00:01:00,493
Oh, you mean Chung?

26
00:01:01,027 --> 00:01:02,028
Oh, yes, he's marvelous.

27
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:03,997
He's efficient,
he's dependable,

28
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:06,499
and he still hasn't figured out American money.

29
00:01:06,499 --> 00:01:08,001
Between you and me,
I told him

30
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:10,904
when they made Lincoln's picture bigger,
it was worth more.

31
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:12,305
(chuckles)

32
00:01:12,305 --> 00:01:13,807
Very funny.

33
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:15,809
Do you suppose that
your man Friday

34
00:01:15,809 --> 00:01:18,244
might be available
on a Monday or Tuesday?

35
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:20,180
You want to steal my Chung?
No, no

36
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,681
Not-Not steal him.

37
00:01:21,681 --> 00:01:23,683
Just borrow him for
a day or two a week

38
00:01:23,683 --> 00:01:25,185
until I can restaff.

39
00:01:25,185 --> 00:01:26,519
A dangerous notion,
Frasier.

40
00:01:26,786 --> 00:01:29,189
You know how employees gossip
about their benefactors.

41
00:01:29,456 --> 00:01:30,457
Well, I have nothing to hide.

42
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:32,859
Yes, but suppose
while on your premises

43
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:34,828
he lets something slip
about me and Deb

44
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:36,296
and our heart-shaped bed?

45
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:40,133
I would refuse to believe him.

46
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:42,969
Did I mention he's a drug mule
?

47
00:01:43,336 --> 00:01:44,871
Oh, he is not.
You're just saying that

48
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:46,406
'cause you don't want
to help me out.

49
00:01:46,806 --> 00:01:47,874
Such insight.

50
00:01:47,874 --> 00:01:50,376
It's a pity more people
don't listen to your show.

51
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:59,052
several other candidates
to interview,

52
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:02,055
but I'll be sure to let you know
by the 12th.

53
00:02:03,556 --> 00:02:05,058
Of never!

54
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:09,963
Honestly, I'm beginning
to wonder

55
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:12,298
if we'll ever find anyone that meets our standards.

56
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:13,666
You're being too picky.

57
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:15,468
It's just housekeeping,
not rocket science.

58
00:02:15,702 --> 00:02:17,070
DAPHNE:
I beg to differ.

59
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:18,371
You don't even know half

60
00:02:18,371 --> 00:02:20,373
of what I used to do
around here.

61
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:23,676
Like dusting the plant leaves
or rotating your underwear.

62
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:26,346
Excuse me?

63
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:29,215
Every month, I used
to throw out your
oldest pair

64
00:02:29,215 --> 00:02:30,183
and put in two
new pairs.

65
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:33,119
Did it ever occur to you
that you never had

66
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:34,988
to buy underwear
in ten years?

67
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:41,194
I thought I got hold
of a good batch.

68
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:43,463
FRASIER:
Well, let's see.

69
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:45,231
Who is our front-runner,
thus far?

70
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:46,666
(wearily):
Oh, I don't know. I...

71
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,001
.
They're all the same to me

72
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:50,370
Honestly, Dad, you know,
I am starting to get

73
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,272
the slightest bit chapped
with your attitude.

74
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:54,641
You haven't even graded
any of the candidates.

75
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:56,142
You've simply doodled
a warplane

76
00:02:56,142 --> 00:02:58,144
dropping bombs
on a soldier.

77
00:02:58,144 --> 00:02:59,646
(doorbell rings)
That's not a soldier.

78
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:01,648
Well, then why is he
wearing a helmet?

79
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:02,515
That's not a helmet.

80
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:05,418
It's someone with a big head

81
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,191
Yes?

82
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,192
Hi, I'm Trish Haney.

83
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,693
I'm here about the housekeeper job.

84
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:14,527
I'm really sorry I'm late.

85
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:17,430
I had you down
for over an hour ago.

86
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,866
I know. I got stuck in line
waiting to buy tickets

87
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:20,768
for the Sonics game
this weekend.

88
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:23,203
Really? Come on in.

89
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:25,038
I should have guessed
everyone and his brother

90
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:26,873
would want to see
Vince Carter play.

91
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:30,109
Not everybody... or his brother.

92
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:33,546
Wow, this is
a beautiful place.

93
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:34,514
Here's my resume.

94
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,549
Ah, thank you.
Won't you be seated?

95
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:37,550
I'm Dr. Frasier Crane.

96
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,551
This is my father,
Martin Crane,

97
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:40,520
and this is my sister-in-law,
Daphne Crane.

98
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,455
Now, I'll get right
to the interview.

99
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:44,891
First question:

100
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,826
What is the best way

101
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,196
to combat rings
on a wooden table?

102
00:03:50,196 --> 00:03:51,698
Um...

103
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:54,701
I've heard
you can rub mayonnaise on it.

104
00:03:55,034 --> 00:03:58,404
The best way is to
provide coasters.

105
00:03:58,671 --> 00:04:01,241
An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.

106
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,242
(laughs)

107
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:05,078
Started me out with
a trick question, right?

108
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,779
So how do you think
the Sonics will defend Carter?

109
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,648
Um, you have to have someone
body up on him

110
00:04:08,648 --> 00:04:10,583
and then double-team
when he gets the ball.

111
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:13,086
Thank you.

112
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,322
DAPHNE
: Trish...

113
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:19,259
if the washing machine
has a 25-minute cycle

114
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,761
and the dryer
has a 40-minute cycle

115
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:24,530
what time does the second load
have to go in the washer

116
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:27,300
to be dry by 5:00?

117
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:31,204
Uh, well, that's 65 minutes, so 3:55.

118
00:04:31,537 --> 00:04:32,605
You may want to take some time

119
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:33,606
to think about these questions be...

120
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:34,607
FRASIER:
Daphne...

121
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:36,542
she's right.

122
00:04:37,977 --> 00:04:40,947
Well done.

123
00:04:41,347 --> 00:04:42,415
Hey, I got a question.

124
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:43,750
Can you clean a house?

125
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:46,085
Yes. And if I do say so myself,
I'm pretty good.

126
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:47,353
Next question:

127
00:04:47,553 --> 00:04:48,955
Can you start Monday?

128
00:04:49,188 --> 00:04:50,256
(chuckles)

129
00:04:50,256 --> 00:04:53,259
You know, we're getting just a bit
ahead of ourselves

130
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,261
We still have
several people to meet.

131
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:57,764
Uh, thank you for coming by.
Oh, sure.

132
00:04:57,764 --> 00:04:59,265
That was the interview, huh?
Two questions?

133
00:04:59,265 --> 00:05:01,267
Well, it was really more
of a pre-screening.

134
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:02,769
We'll be sure
to let you know.

135
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:03,770
Okay, thanks.
Just so you know

136
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,271
I'll be out of town
till the first.

137
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:08,274
...
Fine. Then I'll be sure to call you the second

138
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:12,979
I lose my mind.

139
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:15,315
What? What was wrong with her?

140
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,649
In the first place,

141
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:17,984
she showed up late.

142
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,485
If she doesn't take
the interview seriously

143
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:20,987
how can we expect her
to take the job seriously?

144
00:05:21,387 --> 00:05:23,723
Ah, you just don't like her
because she's not all stuffy

145
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:25,525
She did seem a bit cheeky.

146
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:29,329
Which you never were.

147
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:32,632
Well, I'm afraid so far,
our best candidate

148
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:36,135
is the young man
from Jeepers Sweepers.

149
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:41,908
I will move out if you hire
that prancing moron.

150
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:43,176
All right, fine.

151
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,177
Who would you hire?

152
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,012
This-This-This Trish, I suppose?

153
00:05:46,312 --> 00:05:47,380
Well, I was right
about Daphne.

154
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:47,840
Doesn't that count
for anything?

155
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:50,016
You didn't even want to hire her.

156
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,918
You thought she might steal.

157
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:57,156
Did you really say that?

158
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:58,558
Of course not!

159
00:05:58,558 --> 00:06:00,059
I don't remember.

160
00:06:01,427 --> 00:06:02,762
MARTIN:
Well, whoever gets hired

161
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:05,064
is someone I'm going to have to
spend a lot of time with

162
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:07,033
and I don't need
a lot of quiz questions

163
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,502
and score sheets to get
a feel for someone's character

164
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:14,040
Did I look like a thief?
Was it my shifty eyes?

165
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,675
Look, if you don't trust
my judgment, Frasier,

166
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:17,510
just have the guts
to say so.
No, all right.

167
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:19,846
Fine. You can hire whoever
you want to.

168
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:21,247
You want this Trish?
Fine, call her.

169
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:23,716
Great. I'll call her right now
and tell her she's hired.

170
00:06:24,183 --> 00:06:25,685
And I'll tell her
where you keep
your valuables.

171
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:26,719
FRASIER:
Oh!

172
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:29,222
Would you give it a rest?

173
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:34,227
Hey, Niles.
Have a seat.

174
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,228
Thank you.

175
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:36,729
I'll have my usual.

176
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:40,733
Oh, no, uh, bottled water,
room temperature.

177
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:46,072
Hey, slow down, little man.
What are we celebrating?

178
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:48,408
I can't drink anything
that's too hot.

179
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:49,342
I have a toothache.

180
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:51,778
Oh. You been to the dentist?

181
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:53,746
Yes, but he said
the tooth is perfectly healthy.

182
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,248
I still have
this throbbing pain.

183
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,818
Oh, it's probably just a sinus infection

184
00:06:58,818 --> 00:07:00,119
Have you had a cold lately?

185
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:02,422
A couple of weeks ago, yes,
but I'm-I'm over it.

186
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,423
It's probably what it is.

187
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,424
A sinus infection.

188
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:05,992
It happens to me
all the time.

189
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:08,060
In all likelihood, I'm sure
you're right.
Thank you.

190
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,263
Of course I'm right. What else could it be?

191
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:13,099
Actually, a toothache
can be referred pain

192
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:14,400
from something else.

193
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:15,701
Referred pain?

194
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:17,003
That's right.

195
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:18,771
For example, if I had
a heart condition

196
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:20,273
I might not have pain
in my chest.

197
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:23,776
I might have pain in my tooth,
you see? Referred pain.

198
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:25,578
So, while you're

199
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:27,847
probably right about the sinus infection

200
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:29,849
let's not discount
the one-in-10,000 chance

201
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:32,251
that it might be something
more serious.

202
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:33,653
Oh, now I get it.

203
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:35,655
So the pain in my butt

204
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:38,491
might actually be coming from across the table.

205
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:44,363
Something like that, yes.

206
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:46,332
Oh, look.

207
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:49,635
I'm the winner of a fanny pack.

208
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:50,937
Congratulations.
Thank you.

209
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:52,805
You have no idea
what it is, do you?

210
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:55,775
Uh, not really, no.

211
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:56,642
Hey, look.

212
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:58,478
It says here

213
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,481
the odds of winning it
are one in 10,000.

214
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,816
Ooh... spooky.

215
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:06,118
Same odds as

216
00:08:06,118 --> 00:08:08,020
that toothache
being a heart attack.

217
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,789
Maybe it's a sign.

218
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:12,058
It's a good sign.
By beating those odds once,

219
00:08:12,558 --> 00:08:13,559
it makes it that
much more unlikely

220
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:16,062
that something so improbable
can happen to me again.

221
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:17,363
WOMAN: Niles.
Mmm.

222
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:21,667
Hello, Daphne.

223
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,839
Okay, that's weird.

224
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:34,814
MARTIN:
So, that's the grand tour.

225
00:08:35,314 --> 00:08:36,249
Hard to know where to start.

226
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:38,818
I don't have much time
before I have to go.

227
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:40,253
What? You're leaving already?

228
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,188
Yeah, um,
I have this lunch thing.

229
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:43,589
I hope you don't mind.

230
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:45,258
Well, the problem is
it's this friend

231
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:47,560
that I've been putting off
because I've been too busy

232
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,961
but now I finally don't have any excuse.

233
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:51,864
We're going to try
that new rib place
down in Belltown.

234
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:52,865
Oh, I hear that's great.

235
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:55,301
Yeah, I can bring you back
a great big bag of them.

236
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:57,703
But enough chit-chat.
I've got dishes to do.

237
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:58,704
(chuckling)
Yeah...

238
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:00,206
Oh, hold on.
Can I offer a suggestion?

239
00:09:00,606 --> 00:09:01,974
You're the boss.
What Daphne did was

240
00:09:02,174 --> 00:09:03,242
put a load of laundry in first

241
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:05,144
and that way you can do
two things at once.

242
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:07,547
Okay. Although, I prefer
to do laundry

243
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:10,049
at the end of the day,
and that way I can read

244
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,551
when the clothes
are in the dryer.

245
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:14,320
I mean, it's about the only "me" time
I have on this job.

246
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:19,492
Hey, Dad.
Ready for breakfast?

247
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,193
Well, thanks for the invite,
but I can't go.

248
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:22,562
We didn't invite you.

249
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,063
You called us and badgered us

250
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:26,032
until we rearranged our schedule.

251
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,466
Yeah, well, that was before
Trish came.

252
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:29,936
I really think I should hang
around and show her the ropes.

253
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:31,404
Maybe you should show her where

254
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:32,905
the room freshener is.

255
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:34,340
It smells like
stale cigars in here.

256
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,309
I had some of the guys in
last night for poker.

257
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:37,344
Oh, hey, Niles!

258
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,412
Check this out.

259
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,981
Got a great new card trick.

260
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:42,982
Oh, goody.

261
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:47,420
Yeah. It's called
"The Amazing Niles"

262
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,389
or "The Amazing..." whoever
you're doing the trick with.

263
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:52,391
Like if I was doing it
with Daphne

264
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:53,893
it'd be "The Amazing Daphne."

265
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:55,728
If I was doing it with Frasier,
it'd be...

266
00:09:56,028 --> 00:09:57,096
"The Amazing Frasier."
Yeah, I get it, Dad.

267
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:58,431
Yeah.

268
00:09:58,731 --> 00:10:00,299
That's just my patter.
Okay...

269
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,303
Okay, Amazing Niles,
I want you to draw

270
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:06,639
the ace of spades
out of this deck.

271
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:08,507
Uh, something tells me

272
00:10:08,507 --> 00:10:11,444
that it's going to be this one right here.
Ooh!

273
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:14,780
Ladies and gentlemen,
he drew the ace of spades.

274
00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:16,616
Amazing, Amazing Niles.

275
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:18,117
Isn't that a great trick?

276
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:19,452
Hey, wait a minute.

277
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:23,055
How come this deck only has
aces of spades?

278
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:24,957
What? No, this is the tri...

279
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,463
Wait... wait a minute.
Uh...

280
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,465
This isn't the trick deck.

281
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:33,299
Holy cow!

282
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:34,100
Wh...

283
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:38,304
You just drew the card
I asked you for.

284
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:39,305
What are the odds?

285
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,707
I wonder if you could do it again.

286
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:43,976
No. No, no, no, no.

287
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:45,811
Only... only one
performance a day.

288
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:50,516
Is something wrong?

289
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,319
What?
No.

290
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:56,822
Oh, you know, since we're not
going to have breakfast

291
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,257
maybe we should go.

292
00:10:58,591 --> 00:10:59,659
All right.

293
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,994
That way we can pick up
your car from the shop.

294
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:03,229
What happened to your car?

295
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,498
It got struck by lightning.

296
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:12,004
Okay, washer's running as we speak.

297
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,439
Anything else before I go?

298
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:15,775
You going to lunch now?
It's only 10:00.
Already?

299
00:11:16,108 --> 00:11:18,177
I guess the dishes
will have to wait.

300
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,679
I've got a couple
of errands to run

301
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,113
and then I have
a hair appointment.

302
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:22,581
Trish, I'm a little surprised

303
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:24,083
that you're taking off
like this.

304
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:25,551
I'm a little surprised, too.

305
00:11:25,551 --> 00:11:26,552
I thought my first day

306
00:11:26,552 --> 00:11:28,554
would be more like
orientation, you know?

307
00:11:28,554 --> 00:11:30,556
Show me around,
explain my duties

308
00:11:30,556 --> 00:11:31,957
and then I start work
the next day.

309
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:33,292
Why would you think that?

310
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:35,227
Well, it's been that way
every other place

311
00:11:35,227 --> 00:11:37,129
that I've worked,
and I've had alot of jobs.

312
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:40,533
Well, listen, Trish, I kind of
went out on a limb for you

313
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,035
and I'll never hear
the end of it from my son

314
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:43,936
if you let me down.

315
00:11:44,303 --> 00:11:45,371
Don't worry.

316
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:46,872
You are not going
to regret hiring me.

317
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:48,874
Tomorrow morning,
I'll be like the White Tornado

318
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:50,142
Remember those commercials?

319
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:51,277
White Tornado?
That'll be me.

320
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:52,678
Ten o'clock.

321
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:54,046
So you're not coming back after lunch?

322
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,349
Oh, trust me. You don't want me
cleaning this place drunk.

323
00:11:57,683 --> 00:11:58,718
(laughs)

324
00:11:58,718 --> 00:11:59,652
Oh, and that reminds me.

325
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:00,619
I don't work Mondays.

326
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,054
Gosh, you know,
I better get going.

327
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:04,390
If I'm late to this lunch,
how's that going to look?

328
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:05,558
What about the laundry?

329
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:08,828
10:00 tomorrow,
along with those ribs.

330
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:13,232
Well, I hear
the washer going.

331
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:16,235
I assume that means
our new employee is hard at it.

332
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:17,236
Oh, yeah.

333
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:20,206
She's like the White Tornado

334
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,208
Dad, you know your basketball references

335
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:23,476
go right over my head.

336
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:26,579
You know...

337
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:28,414
she's certainly got
her work cut out for her

338
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:30,416
cleaning up this mess
you and your buddies
made last night.

339
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,417
Well, you don't have to worry about it.

340
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,419
She's all about the work.

341
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,922
Listen, Dad,
I think I owe
you an apology.

342
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:37,857
For what?

343
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:39,291
Well, for thinking

344
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:41,093
I was a better judge
of people than you are.

345
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,728
Just want you to know that I do

346
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:44,497
trust your judgment.

347
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:46,932
Maybe I don't say that
often enough.

348
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:48,267
Anyway, I hope
you can forgive me.

349
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:50,770
There's nothing to forgive, son.

350
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,104
Thanks, Dad.

351
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:53,939
I'll see you later.

352
00:12:57,042 --> 00:12:59,111
Not now, boy.

353
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:02,114
We've got an apartment to clean.

354
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,622
Hi, Niles.
How's it going?

355
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:11,490
I'm as good as dead.

356
00:13:11,924 --> 00:13:13,826
I've been doing research

357
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:15,161
into my family health history.

358
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:16,662
My great-uncle Timothy

359
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:18,430
keeled over from a heart attack
at my age.

360
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:22,668
Bottled water. Please.

361
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:26,672
Are you talking about that tooth again?

362
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:28,674
It's still throbbing,
thank you.

363
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:32,111
Which means my heart is probably
on its last legs.

364
00:13:32,444 --> 00:13:35,281
Come on, Niles, you said it was
a one-in-a-million chance.

365
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:38,050
One in 10,000, and I've been beating
those odds all week.

366
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:39,552
I don't believe in omens,

367
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:41,887
but these are getting
harder and harder to ignore.

368
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:44,557
So are you.

369
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,358
I flipped a coin 17 times
last night,

370
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:47,860
and every time it came up tails.

371
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,362
I only stopped because
I was getting a blister.

372
00:13:50,362 --> 00:13:51,697
Thank you.

373
00:13:51,964 --> 00:13:54,333
How does Daphne put up with all this?

374
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:55,601
I haven't told her about it,

375
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:57,503
'cause unlike you,
she'd worry about me.

376
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,939
Get your heart checked
and stop obsessing about it.

377
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:01,240
I'm going to.

378
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:03,042
In all probability, there's a

379
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:05,444
there's a perfectly
reasonable ex... (gasps)

380
00:14:05,811 --> 00:14:07,713
What?

381
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,382
I won another fanny pack.

382
00:14:13,752 --> 00:14:15,754
No, I'm not mad at you, Trish.

383
00:14:15,754 --> 00:14:18,224
I'm just a little disappointed

384
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:20,759
Well, yesterday it was
your neighbor's funeral

385
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:23,162
and today you got the flu.

386
00:14:23,495 --> 00:14:26,532
No, I kind of believe you,
but...

387
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:30,536
You know, this apartment
doesn't clean itself, so... Huh?

388
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:32,404
Okay. Tomorrow.

389
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,273
9:00 sharp.

390
00:14:34,273 --> 00:14:36,242
10:00? Okay.

391
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:39,245
Well, I'll see you
when you get here. Okay, bye.

392
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,281
(doorknob rattling)

393
00:14:45,751 --> 00:14:47,786
Oh, for God... sakes...

394
00:14:47,786 --> 00:14:49,255
Hey! Careful, mister!

395
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:51,724
You're going to get
water all over a clean floor

396
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:53,592
You know, maybe you can have Trish

397
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:55,594
wax this floor
tomorrow, huh?

398
00:14:55,594 --> 00:14:57,930
She already did, and
it took her two hours!

399
00:14:58,197 --> 00:15:00,266
And it just took you two seconds

400
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:02,234
to mess it up
and start complaining.

401
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:05,170
Well, I'm not complaining, Dad
but look at the streaks here.

402
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:07,172
It's like she never
waxed a floor before.

403
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:11,677
All you do is nag, nag, nag.

404
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:14,680
Meanwhile, she tried a new fabric
softener on your sweater

405
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,681
and you didn't even notice.

406
00:15:16,181 --> 00:15:18,117
Well, my sweaters are supposed
to be dry cleaned.

407
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,486
Oh.
Oh, and remind me

408
00:15:20,886 --> 00:15:22,888
to say something to her
about flipping my mattress.

409
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:26,725
What the hell are you trying
to do, kill her?!

410
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:30,095
Easy, easy, Dad.

411
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:32,097
There's no reason
to get all riled up.

412
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:33,065
My God,

413
00:15:33,465 --> 00:15:34,533
you're actually perspiring.

414
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:36,535
Well, I just think
some people around here

415
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:38,337
don't realize how hard she works.

416
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:41,640
--
Well, I'll say this much

417
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,609
the place does smell lemony fresh.

418
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:48,113
Shows what you know.
It's country breeze.

419
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:53,619
Daphne, I...

420
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,621
have to go out for a while.

421
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:56,989
All right.

422
00:15:57,423 --> 00:16:00,492
No place out of the ordinary--
just... out.

423
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:03,862
Okay. See you later.

424
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:10,402
I can't believe this is happening.

425
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:14,840
After all those misspent years
of frustration and yearning

426
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,409
I finally find the fulfillment
of my dreams...

427
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,912
only to have it snatched away.

428
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:21,814
Look at her.

429
00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:26,518
She's so beautiful, so perfect

430
00:16:26,785 --> 00:16:30,322
She deserves nothing but happiness.

431
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:33,325
I hope when I'm gone

432
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:36,829
she's able to make a life with someone else.

433
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:39,531
After a suitable period
of mourning, of course.

434
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:42,334
Niles?

435
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,737
Yes, my love?

436
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:46,705
When are you going
to change the paper

437
00:16:46,705 --> 00:16:48,707
in the bottom
of the birdcage, hmm?

438
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:50,142
I've asked you three times already.

439
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:51,844
Soon as I get back.

440
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:55,180
Maybe when I'm gone

441
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:59,184
Her Majesty can muck out
her own birdcage.

442
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:02,688
Hey, Fras, sorry to bother you.

443
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:06,191
Uh, Trish was wondering where
you keep the silver polish.

444
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:07,693
Right.

445
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:10,662
I told her about that tarnish
on your shrimp fork.

446
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:13,132
She suggested a place you could keep it

447
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,001
where the air won't get to it.

448
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:19,238
Really? Perhaps she and I should
have a discussion about that.

449
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:21,440
What are you doing here?
Well, my lunch canceled.

450
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,708
I thought I might drop by,
see if

451
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:23,575
you'd like to join me
for a bite.

452
00:17:23,575 --> 00:17:26,045
Oh, sure. Love to.
Let me get my coat.

453
00:17:26,478 --> 00:17:28,047
Right. I'll just tell Trish we're leaving.

454
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,381
Where is she?

455
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:31,750
Oh, uh, she's in the powder room.
Let's go

456
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:33,552
Actually, I-I'd
rather wait, Dad.

457
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:34,853
You see, I wanted to discuss

458
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:36,155
a new vacuuming pattern with her.

459
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:40,159
Uh, well... actually, Fras,
this might not be a good time.

460
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,594
Uh, that shrimp fork thing
really set her off.

461
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:45,130
She kind of went to pieces
and locked herself in there.

462
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:46,598
She did?

463
00:17:47,032 --> 00:17:48,434
I had no idea she was so fragile.

464
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:49,902
.
Well, she'll get over it

465
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:52,604
She just, uh, needs
to be alone for a while. Uh...

466
00:17:52,871 --> 00:17:54,440
She'll be fine.
Uh, bye, Trish.

467
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,941
No, no, Dad,
you know what?

468
00:17:55,941 --> 00:17:56,942
If I've hurt her feelings

469
00:17:57,443 --> 00:17:58,944
then it is incumbent
upon me to apologize.

470
00:17:58,944 --> 00:18:00,446
Well...

471
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:01,447
Trish, it's Dr. Crane.

472
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:02,948
Could you come out here, please?

473
00:18:02,948 --> 00:18:04,950
I'd like to have
a word with you.

474
00:18:07,886 --> 00:18:08,954
The old silent treatment.

475
00:18:08,954 --> 00:18:11,223
Well, two can play that game.
Let's go.

476
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:12,991
No, no, Dad.
Why don't you talk to her?

477
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:14,493
Oh, I don't think so.

478
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:15,461
Please, Dad, she likes you.

479
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:16,462
Please.

480
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:22,000
Uh, Trish?

481
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,502
Hi. It's Marty.

482
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:25,504
Uh, listen,  I know you're upset

483
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:28,006
but I'd like to talk to you.

484
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:33,512
Yeah, um...
would you unlock the door?

485
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:35,514
That a girl.

486
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:45,324
All right, you just take
all the time you need.

487
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:48,327
Okay, well,
she accepted your apology

488
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:50,829
but she just wants to be alone
for a little while

489
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:52,331
so, uh, let's go.

490
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:55,134
Dad, I really should apologize
to her in person.

491
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,402
Well, uh, I don't think
this is the time.

492
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:58,737
Why not?

493
00:18:58,737 --> 00:19:00,672
Well, you have been
pretty critical.

494
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,041
Well, you know, I also think that she's made

495
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:04,543
some real improvements around here.

496
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:06,044
Tell her that.

497
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:08,046
(sighs)

498
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,255
She wants an example.

499
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:25,130
How should I know?
Make something up.

500
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:29,001
Oh, no wonder she's mad,
you ungrateful son of a bitch!

501
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:36,475
MARTIN:
All right.

502
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,443
See you later.

503
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:43,448
Well, now I think
you've made things worse

504
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:46,418
It wouldn't surprise me
if she didn't come in tomorrow

505
00:19:58,897 --> 00:20:00,899
You didn't tell me you had a sister.

506
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,801
Dad!

507
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:09,441
All right,
what the hell is going on?

508
00:20:09,741 --> 00:20:11,810
No idea. I just came by
for my paycheck.

509
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:12,778
MARTIN:
Well, uh..

510
00:20:13,178 --> 00:20:14,246
I got some bad news about that, Trish.

511
00:20:14,746 --> 00:20:16,582
I'm sorry, but we're going to have to let you go.

512
00:20:16,848 --> 00:20:18,417
Oh. Okay.
But you still owe me

513
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:20,752
for the days I was supposed
to be here last week.

514
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,589
Sure, sure, and there'll be
a check in the mail

515
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:26,592
sometime after the first..

516
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:29,428
asteroid hits Earth.

517
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:36,235
Okay, lay it on me

518
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,237
I'm-I'm prepared for the worst.

519
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,038
Is it my heart?

520
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,306
I'm afraid so.

521
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,308
Aha!

522
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:46,778
What?

523
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:48,247
There is an anomaly in your EKG.

524
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:50,182
I'm going to have
to check you into

525
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:52,150
the hospital.

526
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,652
Oh. Uh, well, hm.

527
00:20:54,152 --> 00:20:55,654
Uh, I guess I can clear
my schedule.

528
00:20:56,154 --> 00:20:57,656
Uh, how's, uh,
how's tomorrow afternoon?

529
00:20:58,123 --> 00:20:59,925
No, no, no. Niles?
Hm?

530
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:01,693
You need to go right now.
