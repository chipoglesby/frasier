1
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,044
Oh, this one's
from your mom.

2
00:00:11,444 --> 00:00:14,447
Oh... kitten
in a basket of yarn.

3
00:00:14,781 --> 00:00:16,716
"Dear Niles,

4
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:19,586
I know we haven't always
gotten along."

5
00:00:25,592 --> 00:00:26,926
Isn't that sweet?

6
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:29,029
FRASIER:
Hey, Niles

7
00:00:29,262 --> 00:00:31,297
look what I found
in the parking lot.

8
00:00:31,297 --> 00:00:33,566
Hi, Niles.
It's good to see you.

9
00:00:33,767 --> 00:00:34,300
How's he doing?

10
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:36,669
The doctor says
he's just great.

11
00:00:36,936 --> 00:00:38,505
Well, he looks just great.

12
00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:40,440
(whispers):
Why is he so pale?

13
00:00:40,774 --> 00:00:42,675
(whispers):
He's always this pale.

14
00:00:42,942 --> 00:00:44,477
I'll take those.

15
00:00:44,944 --> 00:00:46,012
Well, Niles,
you've got

16
00:00:46,012 --> 00:00:48,448
quite an impressive
array of flowers here.

17
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:50,917
Uh... Oh, dear Lord.

18
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:52,652
Who sent mums?

19
00:00:52,952 --> 00:00:55,021
Those are from Jaime,
our squash valet.

20
00:00:55,021 --> 00:00:55,955
Really?

21
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:57,357
You know, when I had the flu,

22
00:00:57,357 --> 00:00:58,858
Jaime didn't send me
so much as a card.

23
00:00:59,292 --> 00:01:00,360
You didn't have the flu.

24
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,661
You barely had the sniffles.

25
00:01:01,661 --> 00:01:02,929
I almost threw up.

26
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:04,330
Who knows?

27
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:06,232
Mums might have been just
the thing to cheer me up.

28
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:08,468
I guess we'll never know now, will we?

29
00:01:08,468 --> 00:01:11,137
I'm so sorry you have
to go through all this, Niles.

30
00:01:11,137 --> 00:01:14,040
Oh, I'm pretty used to him by now.

31
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:14,941
Oh, right...

32
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:17,811
The... um, yes,
well... thank you.

33
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:20,346
Who knew all those years
of foie gras and brie

34
00:01:20,346 --> 00:01:22,215
would finally catch up with me.

35
00:01:22,515 --> 00:01:23,583
You know, Frasier,

36
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:25,085
you might want to get yourself
checked out.

37
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:26,453
You eat a lot
of that stuff, too.

38
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:28,788
Yes, but I also drink
a lot of red wine.

39
00:01:28,788 --> 00:01:30,590
Now, Niles,
you'll be happy to know

40
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,425
that your prognosis
is excellent.

41
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,394
I have done some research.
Ah.

42
00:01:34,394 --> 00:01:37,363
I have detailed the procedure
and made copies for each of you.

43
00:01:37,363 --> 00:01:38,298
Here we are.

44
00:01:38,298 --> 00:01:40,100
I also took
the liberty

45
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,035
of checking out your surgeon.

46
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:43,303
A fine choice.

47
00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:47,073
True, he did have a few brushes
with the law as an undergrad

48
00:01:47,073 --> 00:01:48,541
and I think you all know

49
00:01:49,075 --> 00:01:50,844
how I feel about Tulane's medical school.

50
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:53,012
But...

51
00:01:53,012 --> 00:01:55,448
on the bright side, he has been
extensively published

52
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:56,916
and his reputation is stellar.

53
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:59,385
Now, if you'll all please turn
to page 17 in your handouts.

54
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:00,854
Where is Dad?

55
00:02:00,854 --> 00:02:02,388
He stepped outside for some coffee.

56
00:02:02,388 --> 00:02:05,391
Oh, I specifically used
laymen's terms for his benefit

57
00:02:05,892 --> 00:02:06,726
Well, all right.

58
00:02:06,726 --> 00:02:08,895
How's he handling all this?

59
00:02:08,895 --> 00:02:10,196
He's positively chirpy.

60
00:02:10,196 --> 00:02:12,132
.
In other words, he's terrified

61
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,067
,
FRASIER:
Yes, when we were kids

62
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:16,536
whenever one of us
was sick or hurt,

63
00:02:16,536 --> 00:02:18,538
Dad would try to keep us
from worrying

64
00:02:19,038 --> 00:02:21,541
by pretending the problem
didn't even exist.

65
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:23,910
Nonchalance was his coping mechanism.

66
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:26,179
Things always turned out
all right, though.

67
00:02:27,747 --> 00:02:29,716
It will this time, too.

68
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:32,785
How are you holding up?

69
00:02:32,785 --> 00:02:34,287
Well, you know...

70
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:35,788
You know what?

71
00:02:35,788 --> 00:02:38,258
I think you should think of
something really cool to do

72
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:40,293
when all this is over--
like a big trip.

73
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:42,262
That way, you can have something
good to focus on.

74
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:46,533
I can't think about that
right now.

75
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:50,403
What the hey?
You still in bed?

76
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:51,938
It's 9:00
in the morning

77
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:53,940
Up and at 'em, lazy bones.

78
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,242
Hello, I'm your anesthesiologist, Dr. Ling.

79
00:02:56,442 --> 00:02:57,010
Oh, hello.

80
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:58,411
How are you
feeling today?

81
00:02:58,745 --> 00:02:59,779
Oh, don't let
this faker fool you.

82
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:01,214
He's just trying
to get out of work.

83
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:02,649
,
If you're feeling at all anxious

84
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:03,650
I can give you
a mild sedative.

85
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:04,918
No, thanks.

86
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:05,652
Are you sure, Niles?

87
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:07,020
Dr. Ling went to Duke.

88
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:11,658
(phone rings)

89
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:13,126
Hello?

90
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:15,628
Can I ask who's calling?

91
00:03:15,628 --> 00:03:17,063
Just a minute, please.

92
00:03:17,063 --> 00:03:17,997
It's Maris.

93
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:19,966
Do you want me to make up
an excuse?

94
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:22,350
No, that's okay,
I'll talk to her.

95
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:24,804
Thank you.

96
00:03:26,172 --> 00:03:28,208
Hello?

97
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:31,211
Well, yes. How did you hear?

98
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:34,013
Ah... Jaime is a bit
of a gossip.

99
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:36,216
Luckily,
they discovered the blockage

100
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:39,118
before I had a major event.

101
00:03:39,118 --> 00:03:41,120
Well, thank you.

102
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,990
That wasn't the nurse,
that was my wife.

103
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,259
Yes. Daphne.

104
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:48,661
We were married
a couple of months ago.

105
00:03:48,661 --> 00:03:52,165
.
No, well, uh, that's not really my fault
you didn't know

106
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:55,001
Sounds to me like your argument
is with Jaime.

107
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,037
Well, if it makes you
feel any better,

108
00:03:58,538 --> 00:03:59,038
we didn't invite anyone.

109
00:03:59,505 --> 00:04:00,540
Dr. Ling...

110
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:05,111
Uh-huh. Uh-huh

111
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:10,016
Yes, of course we invited him,
he's my brother.

112
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:11,985
Yes: Williams-Sonoma
and Tiffany's.

113
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:13,519
Keep it coming.

114
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:19,359
Now, in just a few moments,

115
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:21,294
we'll be ready to wheel you down to the O.R.

116
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:22,662
He'll receive general anesthesia

117
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:24,163
once he's on
the operating table.

118
00:04:24,163 --> 00:04:26,666
Now, if you'd like to follow
along in your handouts,

119
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:27,667
I could take you through

120
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:29,102
the first steps
of the procedure.

121
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,504
The doctor explained everything
to us yesterday.

122
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,506
Yes, but did he have
an mnemonic verse

123
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:36,376
that goes along to the tune
of "Camptown Races"?

124
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:37,644
Hello.
Ah...

125
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:39,145
Dr. Schafer,
I was just explaining

126
00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:40,580
my brother's procedure
to my family.

127
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,482
I'll hand the floor
over to you.

128
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:43,816
Thank you...?

129
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:45,585
Frasier...Dr.Crane.

130
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:46,519
Oh, great.

131
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:47,520
Once you're under,

132
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:49,522
we'll begin by
inserting some tubes

133
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:50,857
to monitor your blood pressure

134
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,692
Then while one team harvests
the saphenous vein

135
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:54,027
from your right leg,

136
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:56,195
I'll be opening up your chest.

137
00:04:56,195 --> 00:04:56,996
Excuse me, uh...

138
00:04:56,996 --> 00:04:58,331
If I may, um...

139
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:00,233
wouldn't a mid-CAB
be less invasive?

140
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:02,735
I have done some research
into the matter

141
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:05,672
and I believe that is
the prevailing methodology.

142
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:07,940
Well, you may have read
about that in Reader's Digest,

143
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,809
but a mid-CAB is
only appropriate

144
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,811
for limited blockages.

145
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:14,314
My source is not
Reader's Digest.

146
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,182
It is a Harvard colleague.

147
00:05:16,182 --> 00:05:19,552
Harvard being my alma mater.

148
00:05:19,552 --> 00:05:21,054
Harvard!

149
00:05:21,554 --> 00:05:22,555
,
Now, if I'm not mistaken

150
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:24,957
the blockage is in the left
anterior descending artery.

151
00:05:24,957 --> 00:05:26,392
And the right coronary,

152
00:05:26,392 --> 00:05:27,393
Look, in my expert opinion

153
00:05:27,393 --> 00:05:29,662
I'm doing what's best for this patient.

154
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:31,397
And my expert opinion
says otherwise.

155
00:05:31,397 --> 00:05:32,398
Well, if you're such an expert,

156
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:33,900
maybe you should perform
the surgery.

157
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,369
Maybe I should.
Dad.

158
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:39,172
Frasier, you are not operating
on your brother.

159
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,006
Suit yourself.

160
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:42,008
LING:
Maybe it would be best

161
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,509
if everyone stepped out

162
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,378
while Dr. Schafer
talks to the patient.

163
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:46,713
Mrs. Crane,
you're welcome to stay.

164
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:49,248
Niles, I'll...

165
00:05:49,248 --> 00:05:51,017
I'll see you before
they wheel you in.

166
00:05:58,491 --> 00:05:59,926
Well, I'll tell you one thing

167
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:01,394
about that Dr. Schafer's
people skills:

168
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:02,395
I am not a fan.

169
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:03,930
Oh, will you leave it alone?

170
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:04,931
You're being a big pain.

171
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:07,200
Yes, well, I happen
to know a thing or...

172
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,035
a thing or two
about bypass surgery.

173
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:11,037
He was totally
condescending to me.

174
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,873
He was just trying to
let you know who's in charge.

175
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,708
I'm sure, at the first sign of trouble,

176
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,677
he'll run right out here
to consult with you.

177
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:22,915
This is so weird.

178
00:06:22,915 --> 00:06:25,418
24 hours ago,
we didn't even know anything

179
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:26,886
was wrong with Niles.

180
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,855
It just goes to show

181
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:30,723
you can't take a second
for granted.

182
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:32,158
Sure can't.

183
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:34,660
Can't take people for granted, either.

184
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:35,661
You just never know.

185
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:37,063
It's true.

186
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,999
That's why you should always
tell the people you love

187
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,968
just how much
they mean to you.

188
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:44,871
Well, I hope you guys know
how much I care about you.

189
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:46,272
Oh, geez, sure we do.

190
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:47,774
And we care about you, too, Roz.

191
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:49,142
Of course, Roz;
you're like family.

192
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:50,376
And, Dad...

193
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:51,744
I hope you know I love you

194
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:53,646
even at your most difficult.

195
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:55,114
Well, I love you, too, son,

196
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:57,617
even when you treat me
like a child.

197
00:06:57,617 --> 00:07:01,320
Frasier bosses everyone around--
it's just his way.

198
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:02,655
Perhaps if people
behaved more competently,

199
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,589
I wouldn't be so bossy.

200
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:05,024
Maybe you wouldn't be so bossy

201
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:06,959
if you didn't always focus on how everybody else behaves.

202
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:08,928
That'd be the day.
Yes, well, maybe
that's because

203
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,196
human behavior is my profession.

204
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:12,365
n take a day off
once in a while.

205
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:13,065
No kidding.

206
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:14,967
Who asked you, Roz?

207
00:07:14,967 --> 00:07:17,937
Niles is going off
to surgery soon.

208
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,705
Come and wish him well.

209
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:22,508
You know...
we really should tell her

210
00:07:22,508 --> 00:07:24,911
how much
she means to us, too.

211
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:27,346
How are you feeling?

212
00:07:27,346 --> 00:07:29,348
I'm a little woozy.

213
00:07:29,348 --> 00:07:31,851
Maybe I should lie down.

214
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:35,354
Oh, now, Daphne, you know
all the important papers

215
00:07:35,354 --> 00:07:37,256
are in my top
left-hand drawer...

216
00:07:37,256 --> 00:07:39,659
DAPHNE:
Let's not talk
about that right now.

217
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:40,593
You just relax.

218
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:44,030
Okay, Daphne.

219
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:47,533
You know, Daphne, they do these
procedures hundreds of times.

220
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:48,534
I know

221
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:51,471
Okay. It's practically
routine, Daphne.

222
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:54,907
Why do you keep saying my name?

223
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:57,910
I just want to say it
as many times as I can.

224
00:07:57,910 --> 00:07:59,312
Daphne.

225
00:08:01,714 --> 00:08:03,483
What? Still in bed?

226
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:04,750
Look at this goldbrick

227
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,253
Well, if you're going to be loafing around all day,

228
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:09,522
you might as well
have something to read.

229
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:13,359
I know how you love
your Archies.

230
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:15,194
Thanks, Dad.

231
00:08:15,194 --> 00:08:18,798
Oh, a Jughead Double Digest.

232
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:23,603
.
I'll be here waiting for you

233
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:25,071
I love you, son.

234
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:27,473
I love you, too.

235
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:30,810
Frasier.

236
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:33,246
I have a confession to make.

237
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:34,747
Hmm?

238
00:08:34,747 --> 00:08:37,250
Remember when we were kids and
I was wearing your opera cape

239
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,085
and you pushed me
down the stairs?

240
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:41,454
Yes.

241
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:45,725
You didn't push me.

242
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:47,527
I jumped.

243
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:50,863
I was trying to fly
like a Valkyrie.

244
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:54,166
That's not important right now

245
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:57,570
The important thing is
that you get well, all right?

246
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,572
Dr. Crane, Mrs. Crane, it's that time.

247
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:01,007
Ooh.

248
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,442
Okay, we're going to need you
to slide over.

249
00:09:03,442 --> 00:09:07,246
Boy, the hospital's an
interesting place, isn't it?

250
00:09:07,246 --> 00:09:09,515
How so, Niles?
Oh

251
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:12,852
all roads lead to the hospital.

252
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:16,789
We're born here,
we get sick here,

253
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:20,226
and we get well here..

254
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:22,595
always these big, dramatic moments

255
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:25,665
and the hospital
just gobbles them up.

256
00:09:28,367 --> 00:09:30,937
You think a hospital
has memories?

257
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:33,439
I bet it does.

258
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:36,442
I bet when I walked in,
it thought...

259
00:09:36,442 --> 00:09:38,945
"Oh, you again.

260
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:42,448
"You're the little boy
who broke his leg in 1966.

261
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:45,451
Hello, old friend."

262
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:48,454
Wow, a talking hospital.

263
00:09:48,454 --> 00:09:50,957
That would be cool.

264
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:53,292
When are these drugs
going to kick in?

265
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:55,094
I don't know
why I need surgery...

266
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,096
this is the best I've felt in years.

267
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:58,064
Easy... easy...

268
00:09:58,464 --> 00:10:00,900
Daphne, Daphne, Daphne,

269
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:05,471
Okay, you ready to take
a little trip

270
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:06,906
I think he already is.

271
00:10:06,906 --> 00:10:08,708
Can I just have a second?

272
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:10,643
Of course.

273
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:15,982
I'll be here
when you wake up.

274
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,350
Promise?

275
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,851
I promise.

276
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:46,679
What do you mean you
don't like Archie?

277
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:48,180
It's a riot.

278
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:51,183
You got your Jughead, your
Reggie, your Mr. Weatherbee.

279
00:10:53,185 --> 00:10:54,220
Please, stop crying, Maris.

280
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:56,689
The doctor can always
cut off more next time.

281
00:11:04,196 --> 00:11:05,698
I'll be here when you wake up.

282
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:07,233
Promise?

283
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:08,734
Promise.

284
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,019
MARTIN
: How come these places

285
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:29,321
never have any
magazines for men?

286
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:35,561
It's all hairdos
and recipes and butt exercises.

287
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:38,964
I was just thinking
about what Niles said
about the hospital

288
00:11:38,964 --> 00:11:40,966
and the things
that happen here.

289
00:11:40,966 --> 00:11:42,735
Oh, geez, would you
look at this:

290
00:11:42,935 --> 00:11:45,805
"Ten Saucy Secrets
To Please Him In Bed."

291
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:47,406
You know damn well
there are only four.

292
00:11:47,406 --> 00:11:50,976
The rest are just do-si-dos.

293
00:11:50,976 --> 00:11:53,779
It's like the whole
tapestry of life

294
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:57,116
keeps replaying itself
within these walls.

295
00:11:57,116 --> 00:11:59,819
I used to bust people
for that one.

296
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:01,120
You didn't hear a word
I said, did you?

297
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:02,488
Yeah, I did.

298
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:05,791
"Hospital...
tapestry of life."

299
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:09,729
Whoa, that's a nice kitchen.

300
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:12,631
.
You're a sentimental fool, Dad

301
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:15,167
Well, here he is.

302
00:12:15,634 --> 00:12:18,671
Frasier, say hello
to your new brother.

303
00:12:19,171 --> 00:12:20,673
I don't like him.

304
00:12:26,011 --> 00:12:27,446
(chuckles)

305
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:30,316
Remember when you were little
and you convinced Niles

306
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:32,818
that we were all figments
of his imagination?

307
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:34,754
The whole world was just
in his mind?

308
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:38,190
I told him we disappeared
whenever he left the room.

309
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:40,025
For months afterwards,

310
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:41,861
he was always
darting into rooms

311
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:44,363
to make sure we were
all still there.

312
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:45,364
Scared the crap
out of me.

313
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:46,866
I was ready
to kill you.

314
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:48,367
What made you think of that?

315
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:49,869
I don't know.

316
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:52,371
Just thinking about Niles.

317
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:57,510
Well, he must be all right.

318
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:58,444
We're all still here.

319
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:03,883
I don't think I've ever
been this frightened

320
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:05,384
in my whole life.

321
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:08,387
Well, Daph, according
to my timetable,

322
00:13:08,387 --> 00:13:11,690
Niles is probably
off the bypass pump by now.

323
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:14,293
All the blockages
have been bypassed

324
00:13:14,493 --> 00:13:17,062
and the myocardium
is now receiving normal blood.

325
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:18,564
How come you
know all this,

326
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:20,933
but you're stumped by an electric
barbecue fork?

327
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,670
Because the human heart was not
designed by some idiot in Japan.

328
00:13:25,037 --> 00:13:26,572
You know, Frasier,

329
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:29,809
maybe now's not the perfect time to go into detail.

330
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:31,043
It's all right, Roz.

331
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:32,545
You see, she knows.

332
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:35,481
Knowledge is our ally
against anxiety.

333
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:37,883
Which happens to be the theme
for today's Best of Crane

334
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:39,418
which is being broadcast
over the airwaves

335
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:40,719
right this moment.

336
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,589
Oh, yeah. They're piping it into the operating room

337
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:44,890
instead of using anesthesia.

338
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:48,060
Very funny, Roz.

339
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,429
Oh, I hope the doctors
have their earplugs in,

340
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:51,831
so they don't
fall asleep, too.

341
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,232
All right, we get it.

342
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:55,201
Seriously, if I was ever
going to rob a bank

343
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:56,669
and I wanted to knock out
the guards...

344
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,604
All right, Roz.

345
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:10,015
Hey, is that
a Chunky in there?

346
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:13,786
Looks like one.

347
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:16,655
It's been a long time
since I seen one of those.

348
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:18,591
What are they asking for it?

349
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:23,662
Looks like it's 85 cents.

350
00:14:23,662 --> 00:14:26,098
Does it only take
the exact change?

351
00:14:26,098 --> 00:14:29,935
Looks like there's
a dollar slot.

352
00:14:29,935 --> 00:14:32,738
All I have is a ten.

353
00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:33,572
Will it take a ten?

354
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:35,307
Get off your ass
and look.

355
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:37,977
They usually just take singles.

356
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:40,145
Anybody have a single?

357
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:44,783
How can you think
about eating now?

358
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:47,419
What would you rather
have me thinking about?

359
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:48,254
I'll get you some change.

360
00:14:48,754 --> 00:14:49,755
Oh, thanks, Roz.

361
00:14:49,755 --> 00:14:54,193
I've been sitting
way too long, anyway.

362
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:56,695
Excuse me... Colleen.

363
00:14:57,196 --> 00:14:59,498
Do you have any ones?

364
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:00,733
I think so.
Let me check.

365
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,168
Excuse me.
Can I help you?

366
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:06,005
Yes. There's something
wrong with my baby.

367
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:08,741
She has a little rash
on her cheek.

368
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:10,142
I looked in the book

369
00:15:10,142 --> 00:15:12,077
and I don't think
it's chickenpox.

370
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:14,446
But it does look
a little like scarlet fever.

371
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,348
Is this your first child?

372
00:15:16,348 --> 00:15:17,283
Yes. Why?

373
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,218
I think
this is lipstick.

374
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:20,219
Would a five help?

375
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:22,087
No, I'm afraid I need ones.

376
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:23,455
Oh, thank God.

377
00:15:23,455 --> 00:15:25,457
Oh, look at that.

378
00:15:25,457 --> 00:15:28,260
That's probably
how it happened.

379
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:33,032
Thank you.
Colleen, I won't forget you.

380
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:35,367
I'm sorry.
All I've got are fives.

381
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:36,635
Oh, thanks, anyway.

382
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:37,536
Do I know you?

383
00:15:37,903 --> 00:15:39,471
I don't think so.

384
00:15:39,905 --> 00:15:41,807
Are you sure?

385
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:44,009
Trust me, I'm really good with faces. Thanks.

386
00:15:45,911 --> 00:15:46,879
Mrs. Crane?
Yes?

387
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:48,380
Your husband's
doing well.

388
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,883
He's off the pump
and his heart is
beating on its own.

389
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:52,384
FRASIER:
How's his blood pressure?

390
00:15:52,384 --> 00:15:53,218
100/60.

391
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:54,586
Could be better.

392
00:15:54,586 --> 00:15:57,089
Did you thoroughly suction
the cardioplegic solution?

393
00:15:57,589 --> 00:15:58,490
You see, I'm a doctor.

394
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:00,392
Oh, yes, Dr. Schafer told me
about you.

395
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:02,895
He said if you started
asking me questions,

396
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:04,196
I should do this.

397
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:11,003
Oh, I get it.
Very nice.

398
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:13,505
Well, that's
good news, right?

399
00:16:13,505 --> 00:16:14,506
Oh, yeah, great.

400
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:15,307
They didn't have
any change.

401
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:17,109
Oh, shoot.

402
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:29,822
What you reading, Daph?

403
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:32,591
I have no idea.

404
00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:35,594
I must have read
the same paragraph ten times.

405
00:16:35,594 --> 00:16:37,463
I don't know how
you're getting through this.

406
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:39,365
Well, it's not like the old days

407
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:41,867
when heart surgery
was a big thing.

408
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:43,369
Nowadays, they
do it so much,

409
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:45,371
it's like going in for a haircut.

410
00:16:45,871 --> 00:16:48,173
You read the paper and
wait till he's done.

411
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:50,275
But aren't you scared?

412
00:16:53,979 --> 00:16:56,849
Uh, I wonder if that
guy has a dollar.

413
00:16:56,849 --> 00:17:03,288
I bet he does.
Excuse me.

414
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:06,291
Oh, no!

415
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:07,292
What, Daph?

416
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:09,261
I don't believe this.
Excuse me.

417
00:17:09,261 --> 00:17:10,262
What?

418
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:12,264
I was supposed to bring
Niles's cell phone

419
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:14,299
in case any of his
patients called

420
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:16,068
so I could refer them
to Dr. Wells.

421
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:18,303
Now, I'm going to be calling
his stupid cell phone

422
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:20,172
every two minutes
to check his mailbox.

423
00:17:20,172 --> 00:17:22,007
Here, let's use
my cell phone, all right?

424
00:17:22,007 --> 00:17:23,409
We can take turns calling.

425
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:25,778
He asked me to do
this one simple thing

426
00:17:26,278 --> 00:17:28,280
and I forgot.
I'm such an idiot.

427
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,282
Don't go beating yourself up.

428
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:32,284
You didn't do
anything wrong.

429
00:17:32,284 --> 00:17:35,287
Come on.
I'll dial first.

430
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:37,289
Now, look, Niles,
as far as Dad knows

431
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:39,792
I had nothing to do
with your leg breaking, right?

432
00:17:40,292 --> 00:17:41,160
You pushed me.

433
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,028
Yes, and in exchange
for your silence,

434
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:44,029
you'll get ten
of my records.

435
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:45,030
Any ones you want.

436
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:47,032
Even the Shostakovich?

437
00:17:47,032 --> 00:17:48,033
Not that one.

438
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:49,501
Then forget it.

439
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:51,970
Okay, fine.

440
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:54,039
Sign here
and initial here.

441
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:59,278
You still in bed, Mr. Lazybones?

442
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:01,180
If you're going to lie around all day

443
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,681
I got you something to read.

444
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:04,183
The Charterhouse of Parma?

445
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:06,185
Better. Archie.

446
00:18:07,152 --> 00:18:09,621
Well, hello, Chunky.

447
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:10,589
I beg your pardon?

448
00:18:10,956 --> 00:18:12,491
Got some change.

449
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:14,026
Congratulations.

450
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:24,570
Hey, is that
a Marathon bar?

451
00:18:25,003 --> 00:18:26,972
Oh, geez, now I don't know
what to get.

452
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:28,340
You should go with your
first instinct, Dad.

453
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:29,842
I haven't had
a Marathon bar in years.

454
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:31,210
All right, then
get a Marathon bar.

455
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:32,578
Come to think of it,

456
00:18:32,578 --> 00:18:35,047
I think they quit making
Marathons back in the '80s.

457
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:38,550
Then you should get a Chunky.

458
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,052
Uh, although...

459
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:41,553
I kind of want
to get a Marathon bar

460
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:42,821
just to see what
it looks like
on the inside.

461
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:44,089
All right,
just get the Chunky!

462
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:46,892
All right.

463
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:48,160
Hey!
What?

464
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:50,129
It's stuck!

465
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,663
Oh, great,
you had to have Chunky!

466
00:18:52,164 --> 00:18:53,665
Oh, fine! All right!
I'll get it!

467
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:57,002
What is going on?

468
00:18:57,002 --> 00:18:58,237
We have a stuck Chunky.

469
00:18:58,237 --> 00:19:01,240
Why did Chunky
stick his arm in there?

470
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:05,210
Not me, the candy.

471
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:07,713
Oh, I give up.

472
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:08,714
Don't worry, Martin.

473
00:19:08,714 --> 00:19:10,716
I'll stop by tomorrow
and get us some Godiva.

474
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:13,719
But I want my Chunky.

475
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:15,220
Excuse me.

476
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,395
Chunky, was it?

477
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:30,402
Oh, oh, Daphne.

478
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:32,437
It's okay.
It's okay.

479
00:19:32,437 --> 00:19:34,773
Everything's going
to be fine.

480
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:36,441
Do I need to call security here?

481
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:37,809
Uh, no, it's all right.

482
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:38,744
I'm sorry about this.

483
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:40,078
Kind of a tough time.

484
00:19:40,078 --> 00:19:41,413
All right, but keep
this area clear

485
00:19:41,413 --> 00:19:42,915
until I can get it cleaned up.

486
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:45,384
Right. And we'll pay for this.

487
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:47,653
I already paid for this.

488
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:52,925
Daphne, I know
you're in hell right now,

489
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:54,927
but in just about
20 minutes,

490
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:58,430
comes the disconnecting
of the ventilator
and the extubation.

491
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:00,933
You can see it all
in the diagram
on page 24-C.

492
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:01,900
He's not a diagram!

493
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,402
He's my husband

494
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:05,404
and he's on a table
with his chest cut open!

495
00:20:05,404 --> 00:20:08,907
I'm sorry if I can't handle
this as well as the rest of you,

496
00:20:08,907 --> 00:20:10,409
but I'm terrified!

497
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:12,711
Daphne, it's okay.
Just calm down.

498
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,479
When all this is over...

499
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:16,448
There is no
"when this is over"!

500
00:20:16,448 --> 00:20:19,351
There's no tomorrow,
no next week, no next year!

501
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:21,853
There's nothing until
he comes out of there

502
00:20:21,853 --> 00:20:23,121
and I know he's okay!

503
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:25,924
Daphne...

504
00:20:25,924 --> 00:20:27,759
Why don't you sit down, son?

505
00:20:33,665 --> 00:20:36,134
Nobody meant anything.

506
00:20:36,134 --> 00:20:39,137
It's hard as hell for
all of us to be here.

507
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:42,641
I know. It's just...

508
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:44,142
I hate hospitals.

509
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:45,444
I hate them.

510
00:20:45,444 --> 00:20:47,613
I hate all of this.

511
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:48,947
I know.

512
00:20:54,953 --> 00:20:58,957
.
I'm afraid your wife's X rays don't look good

513
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:13,505
Waiting is the hardest part.

514
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:23,015
Niles...

515
00:21:23,015 --> 00:21:24,516
you did great.

516
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:28,020
The doctor said
it went even better
than he expected.

517
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:30,522
I'm so proud of you.

518
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:32,024
He'll be out all night.

519
00:21:32,524 --> 00:21:35,027
Why don't you get
something to eat?

520
00:21:35,027 --> 00:21:38,030
I'll be here
when you wake up.

521
00:22:18,537 --> 00:22:21,540
Say hello to your new sister.

522
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:25,544
Look, she's smiling at you.
