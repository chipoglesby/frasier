1
00:00:08,074 --> 00:00:11,077
We'll be right back
with Julia Wilcox

2
00:00:11,077 --> 00:00:14,080
and our new stock market update
after this.

3
00:00:15,615 --> 00:00:16,616
That's it?

4
00:00:16,616 --> 00:00:18,618
That's your big introducti
on for Julia?

5
00:00:18,618 --> 00:00:20,587
What happened to the copy
I wrote for you?

6
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,991
Come on, "Julia" does not rhyme with "moolah."

7
00:00:24,991 --> 00:00:25,992
Well, they're spelled
the same.

8
00:00:26,426 --> 00:00:28,395
Oh, they are not. Stop it.

9
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:30,830
Isn't it enough that she's getting ten
minutes of my show?

10
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:32,632
Hey, hey,
we're lucky to have her.

11
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:33,967
Don't be surprised
if she ends up

12
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:35,535
boosting your
ratings a notch.

13
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:37,037
Yes, but at what cost?

14
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:38,838
The woman's credibility
is questionable.

15
00:00:39,105 --> 00:00:39,639
She's credible
.

16
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,674
The woman was on CNBC.

17
00:00:41,674 --> 00:00:43,176
She had a
syndicated column.

18
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:45,145
You can't hold one
mistake against her.

19
00:00:45,145 --> 00:00:46,980
What'd she do?

20
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:51,151
She wrote a book called
Day Trade Your Way Out of Debt.

21
00:00:52,952 --> 00:00:56,423
Apparently, some people
lost money.

22
00:00:56,423 --> 00:00:58,825
I don't see you
writing any books.

23
00:00:58,825 --> 00:01:00,827
Now, listen,
she's a little sensitive
.

24
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:03,329
So, I don't want hear anyone talking about the book

25
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:04,664
how it ruined her career

26
00:01:04,998 --> 00:01:07,067
that guy who killed
himself in Pennsylva...

27
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,368
Hey, hey, hey!

28
00:01:08,635 --> 00:01:09,702
There she is!

29
00:01:10,136 --> 00:01:11,171
Our financial wizard.

30
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:13,173
This is Dr. Frasier Crane.
Hello.

31
00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:15,175
And his producer
Roz Doyle.
Hi.
Nice to meet you.

32
00:01:15,675 --> 00:01:17,710
So, this is my mike?

33
00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:19,045
Yes, yes.

34
00:01:19,045 --> 00:01:21,347
You know, I studied
finance in college.

35
00:01:21,848 --> 00:01:22,849
Hey, that's great.

36
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:26,286
Do you think you could
get me some coffee, Rizzo?

37
00:01:28,154 --> 00:01:29,189
It's Roz.

38
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:30,123
Super.

39
00:01:30,123 --> 00:01:32,826
Two creams. Thanks.

40
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:36,663
So, um, do your intro,
we'll go to a promo

41
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:38,164
then back to you.

42
00:01:38,164 --> 00:01:40,667
Got it?
Intro, promo, you.

43
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:43,436
So you don't want me
to do the intro last?

44
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:44,737
Uh, no, because

45
00:01:44,737 --> 00:01:46,739
you see, intro's short...

46
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:48,141
(chuckles):
Oh, I get it.

47
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:49,476
Very good.

48
00:01:49,843 --> 00:01:50,910
You got one past me.

49
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:53,880
Enjoy it, it's not
going to happen again.

50
00:01:54,347 --> 00:01:56,416
And these would be
my phones.

51
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:57,917
Yes, yes, of course.

52
00:01:57,917 --> 00:02:01,421
I must say that
I enjoyed your
work on CNBC.

53
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:04,924
I thought you were
an insightful analyst.

54
00:02:04,924 --> 00:02:07,927
And I don't believe that you were treated fairly.

55
00:02:08,361 --> 00:02:08,928
Oh, thanks.

56
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:11,231
That makes everything
all better.

57
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:12,832
Ten seconds.

58
00:02:13,032 --> 00:02:14,901
Oh, thanks.

59
00:02:15,201 --> 00:02:17,670
(coughs):
You call this coffee?

60
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:20,006
Most of it.

61
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:21,941
(chuckles)

62
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:22,909
Roz.

63
00:02:24,944 --> 00:02:27,447
Put that over there.

64
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:29,415
Hello, Seattle
Welcome back.

65
00:02:29,415 --> 00:02:32,385
If you've tuned in
for mental health advice

66
00:02:32,385 --> 00:02:33,887
with an erudite twist,

67
00:02:38,391 --> 00:02:40,460
But now for something new,

68
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,428
as finances can be the cause

69
00:02:42,428 --> 00:02:45,665
.
of that old bugaboo-- stress. Here now..

70
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,167
Good afternoon,
I'm Julia Wilcox.

71
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:49,135
Today's market swerved

72
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:50,637
like a nervous student driver

73
00:02:50,637 --> 00:02:54,574
before finally winding up
in a nice, safe neutral.

74
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:57,410
Are pharmaceutical stocks
still worth prescribing?

75
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:58,912
Now this.

76
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:00,346
Excuse me.

77
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:02,148
I was supposed to introduce you.

78
00:03:02,448 --> 00:03:03,516
You were cutting into my time.

79
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:04,417
Well, I was giving you

80
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:05,785
a hospitable segue.

81
00:03:05,785 --> 00:03:07,287
You see, I thought that
since you're new here

82
00:03:07,787 --> 00:03:10,623
I could lend you my
equity, if you will.

83
00:03:10,623 --> 00:03:11,624
It was just
a courtesy.

84
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:13,426
Some days on the market

85
00:03:13,626 --> 00:03:15,195
it's black Friday,
but today

86
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,063
with the Nasdaq
slightly down

87
00:03:17,063 --> 00:03:19,299
and the Dow slightly up,
it was more like

88
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:20,633
plaid Monday.

89
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:23,636
Analysts spoke out
of both sides...

90
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:26,539
Next time I'll get the coffee.

91
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,381
Julia's book.

92
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:38,251
Listen to this
 "Chapter Four

93
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:41,588
How to Sell Your House
and Start a Dot-Com."

94
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:44,924
Hey, guys.

95
00:03:44,924 --> 00:03:47,493
Oh, Roz, I can't believe
you shelled out three dollars

96
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:49,495
to revel in someone
else's misfortune.

97
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:50,930
I was curious.

98
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:53,466
Well, you can get the same thing on tape for $1.50.

99
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:54,467
Get this

100
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,469
it's read by Martha Stewart.

101
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:57,937
How's that
for your double whammy?

102
00:03:57,937 --> 00:04:00,406
(laughing)

103
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,809
We should just get rid of her.

104
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:04,711
I mean,
if she were nice

105
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:05,612
it'd be one thing.

106
00:04:06,112 --> 00:04:07,480
But she's just rude
and arrogant.

107
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,782
Whoa, whoa, whoa, nobody's getting rid of anybody.

108
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:13,353
She just filed suit against CNBC
for wrongful termination.

109
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:15,822
Legal wants us to treat her
with kid gloves.

110
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:17,257
Truth be told...

111
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,626
I actually feel sorry for her.

112
00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:22,629
She has suffered
a very public fall.

113
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:24,631
She must be carrying
all kinds of guilt

114
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:27,400
about the people who lost their
savings following her advice.

115
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:32,338
You know, perhaps I shou
ld have a talk with her.

116
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:35,341
I wondered how long
it would take.

117
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:36,342
What?

118
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:39,178
For you to make your move.

119
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:41,314
I thought there were
some sparks between you two.

120
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:42,649
What are you
talking about?

121
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:44,651
Don't play innocent.

122
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:47,153
She is right up your alley.

123
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:52,091
Smart, tough...
total bitch.

124
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:54,727
You can't wait

125
00:04:54,727 --> 00:04:56,729
to break through
that wall and rescue her.

126
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:59,232
Oh, Roz, you couldn't
be more off the mark.

127
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:00,700
Typical man.

128
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,670
You always want to get in there
and rescue us.

129
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:07,507
But the minute things get messy,
you just can'’’t handle it

130
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:08,808
Ha!

131
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:11,311
Women want to make us
think that they're tough.

132
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,813
And then all of a sudden,
they get needy.

133
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:17,317
Men are like, "Come on, baby,
you can lean on me.

134
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,118
Oops, got to go."

135
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:22,188
."
Yeah, women are like, "Get away,
get away. Don't leave me

136
00:05:22,188 --> 00:05:24,524
Here's men:
(deep groan)

137
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:27,327
Here's women:
(helpless squeal)

138
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:28,594
(deep groaning)
(squeals)

139
00:05:28,594 --> 00:05:30,596
All right, stop it, both of you!

140
00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:34,567
Hello, all.

141
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,002
Hello, Niles.

142
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:37,370
How's it going?

143
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,205
We're just
discussing a new

144
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:41,074
rather unpleasant colleague of ours.

145
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:42,575
Be thankful that
you're self-employed.

146
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:44,577
You don't have to
deal with these headaches.

147
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,546
Oh, not so.
I was hoping to come here

148
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:47,980
and complain
about my office remodel.

149
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,850
I'm annexing
the dermatologist's
office next door.

150
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:54,799
And in a cheap irony,
my skin is breaking out.

151
00:05:54,799 --> 00:05:56,856
Oh, your spackle allergy again?

152
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,691
I'm covered with tiny bumps.

153
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,693
It's worse than the summer

154
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:03,463
we added the breakfast nook
to the tree house.

155
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:05,231
Could I have my usual?

156
00:06:05,231 --> 00:06:06,232
Thank you.

157
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:07,567
ROZ:
There she is.

158
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:10,403
Don't come over,
don't come over,
don't come over.

159
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:18,611
Oh, look who's
too good for us.

160
00:06:18,611 --> 00:06:20,113
You know what?

161
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:24,617
I think I will
go and offer her
an olive branch.

162
00:06:24,617 --> 00:06:26,119
(low groan)
Oh, stop it.

163
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:27,587
(helpless squeal)
Knock it off.

164
00:06:33,092 --> 00:06:34,460
Hello, Julia.

165
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:35,762
Hello.

166
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:37,730
Listen, I, uh...

167
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,233
I'm sorry that
the two of us got off

168
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,734
to a bit of a frosty start.

169
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:43,236
But I think that in time

170
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:45,605
we will have a very long
and rewarding relationship.

171
00:06:45,938 --> 00:06:48,975
Okay.

172
00:06:50,476 --> 00:06:52,245
May I tell you a story?

173
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:54,814
(sighs)

174
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,649
Years ago, I lived in Boston.

175
00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:00,653
I was in private practice then
and life was very good.

176
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:02,655
And then my wife left me.

177
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:06,125
I ended up on a ledge,
threatening to throw myself off

178
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:07,560
if she didn't return to me

179
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:09,462
Thank you.

180
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:11,864
Well...

181
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:14,300
this got on the news,
of course.

182
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,302
And needless to say,
after that

183
00:07:16,302 --> 00:07:21,240
patients were a little
hard to come by.

184
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:24,210
So...

185
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:26,879
just wanted you to know
that I, too, have suffered

186
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:29,282
a very public setback.

187
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:31,150
Oh, I get it.

188
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:33,653
You're letting me know
I'm not alone.

189
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:35,154
Exactly.

190
00:07:35,154 --> 00:07:37,089
And now we
can be friends.

191
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,492
.
Well, if that's how you feel

192
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:41,461
Let's see, how do I feel?

193
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,963
Well, it's sort of like
on your show

194
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:46,432
when you call people at home
to give them advice...

195
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,301
Actually, I don't call them, they call me.

196
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:51,604
Exactly.

197
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:00,480
Well.

198
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,181
Good day, then.

199
00:08:06,552 --> 00:08:07,487
Why would you let Niles

200
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,055
bring all his patients
to your home?

201
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:10,556
It's only
a couple more weeks

202
00:08:10,556 --> 00:08:12,058
until his office
is finished.

203
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,527
Well, I sure wouldn't want
to have all those crazies over.

204
00:08:15,027 --> 00:08:18,564
I mean, what if one of them
starts screaming obscenities

205
00:08:18,564 --> 00:08:20,900
or running through
the house naked?

206
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:24,737
Mum already did that when
England lost in the World Cup.

207
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:27,707
Hey.
Hello, all.
Hello.

208
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:29,108
How was the Wine Expo?

209
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:30,877
Horrible!

210
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:33,212
Frasier ran into a fan.

211
00:08:33,212 --> 00:08:34,714
Ow, that smarts.

212
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:35,982
Yes, Dad.

213
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,717
You have been using
that same old joke

214
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:40,219
for the last ten years.

215
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:43,556
So anyway, I ran into
this fan...

216
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:45,791
Ouch. Are you okay?

217
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:52,598
So, this woman
complimented me

218
00:08:52,598 --> 00:08:53,933
on my so-called

219
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:57,737
chemistry with that harpy Julia.

220
00:08:57,737 --> 00:08:59,505
Have you ever heard anything

221
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:00,773
more preposterous?

222
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:05,278
Good lord, the woman sneezed
once and I said, "Bless you."

223
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:08,180
That has been the extent
of our byplay.

224
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:10,583
You've been complaining
about her so much lately

225
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,084
I'm beginning to wonder

226
00:09:12,084 --> 00:09:13,920
if there's not
something deeper there.

227
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,223
I will not even dignify that
with a response.

228
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,725
Except to say that you
couldn't be more wrong.

229
00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:23,429
.
I don't know, Frasier.
She's certainly attractive

230
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:26,365
And she's intelligent,
ambitious, tenacious...

231
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:28,067
Sounds like your
perfect woman.

232
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:31,203
She is a cold,
insufferable know-it-all.

233
00:09:31,203 --> 00:09:33,439
And the list goes on and on.

234
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:36,275
All right, that's it.

235
00:09:36,275 --> 00:09:38,277
No more talking
about Julia.

236
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:39,612
Oh

237
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:43,282
so it's "Julia" now.

238
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,618
(teasingly):
Oh...

239
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:48,621
It has always been Julia.

240
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:50,022
That is her name.

241
00:09:50,022 --> 00:09:52,425
She does seem to have you
disproportionately upset.

242
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,427
You haven't been
so consumed with one subject

243
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:57,229
since Frasier Crane Day.

244
00:09:57,463 --> 00:10:01,033
Listen, my outrage
is completely merited.

245
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:03,035
That woman is
deliberately trying

246
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:05,037
to undermine my show
from within.

247
00:10:05,037 --> 00:10:06,539
I am sorry to disappoint
all of you

248
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:09,041
but I have absolutely
no feelings for that woman

249
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:10,309
except contempt.

250
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:11,644
There he goes again.

251
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:13,613
You know what they say about
people who protest too much?

252
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:14,981
I know what you used to say--

253
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:17,316
"They should
all be teargassed."

254
00:10:19,318 --> 00:10:20,753
I still think that, you know.

255
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,158
Ah, here you are.

256
00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:27,660
Listen...

257
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,196
It's time the two of us
had it out.

258
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:31,697
Ever since you arrived here

259
00:10:31,697 --> 00:10:34,200
you have been nothing but
condescending and dismissive.

260
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,201
Whatever.

261
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:37,203
There, you did it again.

262
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:38,704
You know what this
is really about?

263
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:41,707
It's about you losing 15 minutes from your precious show.

264
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:44,377
What are you talking about?
It's ten minutes.

265
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,213
Sorry. Starting Monday, I do
the last 15 minutes of your show

266
00:10:47,713 --> 00:10:49,181
with a half-hour recap
on Fridays.

267
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:51,984
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have places to be.

268
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:54,086
No, I will not
excuse you.

269
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:55,421
I am reaching out to you here.

270
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:56,889
Yeah, will you cut that out?

271
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:59,392
It's like you're trying
to make me your special project.

272
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:01,227
Why don't you just adopt a cat or something?

273
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:04,063
As your colleague

274
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:06,966
I do not deserve
to be treated this way.

275
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,402
Oh, no, we are
hardly colleagues.

276
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:11,737
I deliver the news and you're a..

277
00:11:11,737 --> 00:11:14,874
Magic Eight Ball
with a Harvard degree.

278
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:15,708
(gasps deeply)

279
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:18,744
I will not be belittled
by a half-educated

280
00:11:18,744 --> 00:11:21,247
money-grubbing parvenu!

281
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:23,749
As opposed to some
foreign-speaking windbag!

282
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,751
That makes you
an insecure fraud!

283
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:27,153
You are a pompous
blowhard!

284
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,654
Harridan!
Know-it-all!

285
00:11:28,654 --> 00:11:29,989
Shrew!
Snob!

286
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:31,657
Are you as turned on
as I am?

287
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:34,393
What? No!

288
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,028
Did you just
come on to me?!

289
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:38,130
What? No... No, I thought...
I thought that...

290
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:39,932
How could you think
I was turned on?

291
00:11:39,932 --> 00:11:41,400
What, are you sick?!

292
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:44,437
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
let's all calm down here

293
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:45,404
Are you crazy?

294
00:11:45,404 --> 00:11:46,405
No, I apologize!
I... I...

295
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:48,407
(disgusted groan)

296
00:11:56,515 --> 00:11:58,017
Oh, hey, Dr. Crane.
How...

297
00:12:02,588 --> 00:12:04,090
They hate me, don't they

298
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:05,057
Can you blame them?

299
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:06,992
Because of you,
they had to come in here

300
00:12:06,992 --> 00:12:07,993
for this sexual harassment
seminar.

301
00:12:07,993 --> 00:12:08,828
(sighing):
I know.

302
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:10,196
But I have apologized

303
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:11,964
till I'm blue in the face.

304
00:12:12,164 --> 00:12:13,199
I know, but Legal wants us covered

305
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,234
in case Julia tries to come after us.

306
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:16,235
Maybe you've heard:

307
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:19,739
She loves suing
people's asses off.

308
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,607
I'm going to miss saying "asses."

309
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:27,513
After today, I guess
it's back to "patootie."

310
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:29,415
Thanks a lot, Doc.

311
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:36,555
Hi. Welcome.

312
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:38,491
Please take a workbook

313
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:45,731
Hey, Frasier.
Mmm.

314
00:12:45,731 --> 00:12:47,767
Thanks for ruining my weekend.

315
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,235
Oh, Roz...

316
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:51,270
Come on, you know
it was just a mistake.

317
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,772
What do you think I am,

318
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,273
some sort of
disgusting Lothario?

319
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:56,275
Hey! There's my man!

320
00:12:57,743 --> 00:12:58,778
Welcome. Please
take a workbook.

321
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:00,746
Got an old one.

322
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:02,782
Hey, I know you're down.
Don't sweat it.

323
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,183
Rookie mistake.

324
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:07,119
By the way, the chick
at the coffee table's
got her high beams on.

325
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:08,120
(barks)

326
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:19,465
(clears throat)

327
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:25,271
KENNY:
Okay, people, let's get this started.

328
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:26,605
Uh, first of all, I apologize

329
00:13:26,605 --> 00:13:28,107
for bringing everyone in here today,

330
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:29,608
but to make it up to you,

331
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:31,544
everyone attending today will get a free mousepad.

332
00:13:31,944 --> 00:13:32,511
How's that?

333
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:34,313
ROZ:
It sucks.

334
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,081
All right,
who said that?

335
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:37,917
I did.

336
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:40,119
Fair enough.

337
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:42,822
Now, I don't want
to blame anyone...

338
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,724
(sneezing):
Frasier!

339
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:48,093
...but Legal says that we have to do this,

340
00:13:48,427 --> 00:13:51,297
so here's Van Andrews
from "Harassment Solutions."

341
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:54,633
...
Okay, guys

342
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:57,636
I'm Van,
I'll be your facilitator

343
00:13:57,636 --> 00:14:00,139
and if you could go ahead and
just open up your workbooks,

344
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:02,141
we'll get started on building

345
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:05,477
a truly gender-neutral
workplace, okay?

346
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:10,115
Now, who wants to meet
my puppets?

347
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:11,951
(everyone groaning)

348
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:25,831
STEVE:
Wow, this is great!

349
00:14:25,831 --> 00:14:27,266
I like coming over to your house.

350
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:29,335
It's really nice.

351
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:33,472
Thanks.

352
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:35,441
since we're doing stuff
at each other's houses now

353
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:38,844
Uh, thanks for the offer, Steve,
but this isn't a social call

354
00:14:38,844 --> 00:14:40,813
We're having
our regular session.

355
00:14:41,146 --> 00:14:42,581
I really
want this to feel

356
00:14:42,848 --> 00:14:43,916
just like the office.

357
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:44,917
Okay. Um..

358
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:47,253
Well, I've been having
my dream again. Uh...

359
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:48,087
(knocking)

360
00:14:48,587 --> 00:14:50,089
Uh, yes?

361
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:51,423
Sorry to interrupt,
Dr. Crane

362
00:14:51,657 --> 00:14:53,125
but I got to run
these toilet fixtures

363
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:54,026
past you.

364
00:14:54,526 --> 00:14:55,527
Your wife said you definitely

365
00:14:55,527 --> 00:14:56,829
want to be consulted about that.

366
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:58,631
STEVE:
I never pictured you

367
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:02,034
having a bathroom!

368
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:05,337
Um, it isn't a good time

369
00:15:05,704 --> 00:15:06,772
If you...

370
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:08,774
I'm sorry, I didn't realize your session had begun.

371
00:15:08,774 --> 00:15:10,776
Why don't you just wait
in the living room?

372
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:12,278
Okay, but just
so you know

373
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:14,113
the heated seat you want's on back order.

374
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:17,716
Again, I'm sorry, Niles, but while I have you here

375
00:15:17,716 --> 00:15:19,685
do you want anything
from the shops?

376
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:20,686
No. I'm good.

377
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:21,620
Okay, then I'm off.

378
00:15:23,555 --> 00:15:25,057
Happy therapy.

379
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:31,096
(clears throat)

380
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:32,898
So, back to your dream.

381
00:15:32,898 --> 00:15:34,233
Your wife seems nice.

382
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:36,235
She's foreign.

383
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:38,137
That's weird.

384
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:40,306
And then, I guess it shouldn't be.

385
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:42,074
I mean, it would only make sense

386
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:44,076
that you have a wife
and a bathroom and...

387
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:46,078
and you probably have
a bed and laundry

388
00:15:46,578 --> 00:15:47,980
and that thing
I can't talk about.

389
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:48,948
Refrigerator.

390
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,863
Right.

391
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:55,487
Okay, well, we're not really here to learn about my life,

392
00:15:55,487 --> 00:15:58,390
we're here to talk about you,
so... back to your dream.

393
00:15:58,724 --> 00:16:00,793
Okay, um, well,
I'm in this forest...

394
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:01,794
(phone rings)

395
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,295
Do you want to get that, or...?

396
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:05,130
Nope, nope, it's okay.
The machine'll get it.

397
00:16:05,397 --> 00:16:06,966
Uh, now, you remember,
as we discussed

398
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,935
the forest could be a symbol
of uncharted territory.

399
00:16:09,935 --> 00:16:11,704
Um, could be...

400
00:16:11,904 --> 00:16:13,472
DAPHNE (on machine):
♪♪ Nobody's home... ♪♪

401
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:16,942
NILES (on machine):
♪♪ Nobody's home... ♪♪

402
00:16:17,242 --> 00:16:20,813
BOTH ("Beethoven'’’s Fifth"):
♪♪ Nobody's home, nobody's home,
nobody's home ♪♪

403
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,749
♪♪ Nobody's home,
nobody's home, nobody's home ♪♪

404
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:27,886
♪♪ We'll call you back,

♪

405
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:30,289
♪♪ After you hear
the (beep). ♪♪

406
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:39,164
So, uh, next week at your place.

407
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:41,166
(weak laugh)

408
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:45,671
Okay, Bulldog, in this exercise,

409
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:48,674
we're going to pretend that you have an
attraction to Roz.

410
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,509
Is that okay?

411
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:53,379
Well, Van, I feel
a little uncomfortable

412
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:55,881
about violating
her personal space

413
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:59,818
even for role-playing, but... okay.

414
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:02,287
Okay, Roz.

415
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:04,289
Bring it on.

416
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:05,791
Ok

417
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,792
Go.

418
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:08,227
Good morning, Roz.

419
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:10,662
You're looking
professional today

420
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:14,233
Thank you, Bulldog.

421
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:15,734
You're looking
professional today, also.

422
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:18,170
Why, thank you.

423
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:21,140
After work, would you care to join me for a coffee

424
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,642
or non-stimulating beverage?

425
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:26,512
Please note you retain the option to say no

426
00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:29,148
Excellent, Bulldog.
Roz?

427
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:31,417
Thank you, Bulldog,
for you offer,

428
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:33,419
but I'm uncomfortable with it

429
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:36,755
as I would prefer to cut
my own arm off and eat it.

430
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:42,227
Can I have a turn with her?

431
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:43,495
No, sorry, buddy.

432
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:44,897
She's not your property!

433
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,398
It's up to Van!
I want a turn!

434
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:47,399
BULLDOG:
Sit down, Noel

435
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:49,368
Oh, oh, what are you
going to do, huh?

436
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:50,903
Oh, what are you
going to do?

437
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:53,405
Guys, guys, let's keep our dialoguing constructive, okay?

438
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:54,373
I think we're done here.

439
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:55,874
Why don't you go ahead and..

440
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:57,376
Oh, great.

441
00:17:57,376 --> 00:17:58,377
...have a
seat, okay?

442
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:02,481
Um, I'd like to say something.

443
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:03,715
Okay, go ahead, Gil.

444
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:12,724
From the bottom of my heart,

445
00:18:12,724 --> 00:18:15,727
I apologize for
my wandering eye
over the years.

446
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:19,731
Those whom I mentally undressed and...

447
00:18:19,731 --> 00:18:21,733
you know who you are..

448
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:24,636
all I can say-- and it's a poor defense--

449
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:28,540
is that I was a product of the thoughtless
machismo of my times.

450
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,042
Thank you, Gil.

451
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:32,044
But know this:

452
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:36,048
Gil isn't about to stop loving the ladies.

453
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:38,917
VAN:
Uh, thank you, Gil

454
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:41,320
I think they like
to be called women now.

455
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,255
Ha! Do they ever!

456
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:49,995
How much longer do we have
to sit for this nonsense?!

457
00:18:49,995 --> 00:18:51,296
Well, Frasier

458
00:18:51,563 --> 00:18:53,132
since you're the one
who brought us here today

459
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:57,136
maybe you'd like to take a turn in the
warm seat, hmm?

460
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,638
Julia, would you be comfortable
 in helping Frasier

461
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:01,640
learn how he could
have related to you

462
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,509
in a more office-
appropriate manner?

463
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:05,844
Uh... Julia?

464
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:09,848
She's playing solitaire
on her palm pilot, Van.

465
00:19:09,848 --> 00:19:12,351
Oh, all right.

466
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:21,126
VAN:
Okay..

467
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:23,962
in this "no-fault" rewind

468
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:27,466
let's find out
how Frasier assaulted you.

469
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:29,468
I did not
assault her!

470
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:31,470
I simply expressed unhappiness that

471
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,739
she was taking 15
minutes from my show.

472
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:36,475
She responded by
belittling my profession.

473
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,443
And then he called me
a couple of names

474
00:19:38,443 --> 00:19:39,444
and asked
if I was turned on.

475
00:19:39,444 --> 00:19:40,412
VAN:
Okay, gang

476
00:19:40,812 --> 00:19:43,382
where did Frasier go wrong?

477
00:19:43,382 --> 00:19:44,850
(murmuring, snapping fingers)

478
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:46,351
Uh, Bulldog.

479
00:19:46,785 --> 00:19:49,755
People stopped saying
"turned on" 20 years ago.

480
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:51,690
No, look, look!

481
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:54,993
I just misread
her... her signals!

482
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:59,598
I-I thought that
her hostility was
displaced attraction.

483
00:19:59,831 --> 00:20:00,899
No, it was just hostility.

484
00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:02,401
Well, of course it was

485
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:03,769
That's all the
re is to you.

486
00:20:04,069 --> 00:20:05,637
Ever since you arrived
at this station

487
00:20:05,637 --> 00:20:07,639
we have reached out to you
in friendship

488
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:09,141
and all we've gotten in return

489
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:10,943
is arrogance
and unbridled rudeness!

490
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:13,212
It's not rudeness,
it's indifference.

491
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,214
I'm sorry I'm not joining your bowling team

492
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,182
but this is just a pit stop
for me.

493
00:20:17,182 --> 00:20:19,718
I do not intend on spending
the rest of my life

494
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:22,554
at a station that cuts out
whenever the janitor vacuums!

495
00:20:22,854 --> 00:20:23,922
Ooh.

496
00:20:23,922 --> 00:20:24,890
No offense

497
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:27,392
None taken.

498
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:28,860
And I don't even
know why we're here.

499
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,395
I'm not going to sue your stupid station.

500
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:31,863
I mean, how pathetic
would that look?

501
00:20:32,264 --> 00:20:33,332
How dare you.

502
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:36,168
At KACL, we are a family.

503
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:38,503
Every person in this room respects one another..

504
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:40,005
No, no, no, hold on
a second, Doc.

505
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:41,406
I'll handle this.

506
00:20:41,773 --> 00:20:43,342
You mentioned something about
not suing us.

507
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:44,309
Would you put that in writing?

508
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:45,677
If it gets us out of here.

509
00:20:46,011 --> 00:20:47,546
Sure. That should satisfy Legal.

510
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:48,547
(happy murmuring)

511
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:50,048
Okay, wait, wait.

512
00:20:50,048 --> 00:20:53,051
This course isn't about Legal, okay?

513
00:20:53,051 --> 00:20:54,553
It's about making respecting

514
00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:56,054
each other's
personhood fun

515
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:57,556
ROZ:
Up yours!

516
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:58,557
Who said that?

517
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,058
ROZ:
I did!

518
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:08,433
You know, you can act
as tough as you want

519
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:09,701
but I see through you.

520
00:21:09,901 --> 00:21:11,436
Really.

521
00:21:11,837 --> 00:21:14,406
You're not in the
big leagues anymore.

522
00:21:14,406 --> 00:21:16,408
Blame it on the market

523
00:21:16,408 --> 00:21:18,910
Blame it on bad luck.

524
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:20,912
But somewhere in the
back of your head

525
00:21:20,912 --> 00:21:22,414
is that nagging voice that keeps saying

526
00:21:22,414 --> 00:21:24,182
maybe you weren't good enough.

527
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:26,785
And now that you are here,

528
00:21:27,052 --> 00:21:28,120
you won't form relationships

529
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,621
You keep everybody
at arm's length.

530
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:30,622
Anything to convince yourself

531
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:34,126
that this is just a stop
along the way.

532
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:36,128
And above it all,

533
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:39,598
I think you're terrified that
you're going to fail here, too

534
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:43,068
Then what do I know?

535
00:21:43,502 --> 00:21:48,073
I'm just a magic eight ball with a Harvard...

536
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:50,876
and Oxford degree.

537
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:56,615
It's 45 past the hour

538
00:21:56,615 --> 00:21:59,117
which means it's time once again for the woman who...

539
00:21:59,117 --> 00:22:00,118
(clears throat)

540
00:22:00,118 --> 00:22:02,154
.
...is known
as Julia Wilcox

541
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,655
Thank you, Frasier.

542
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:05,657
Another up day
for the markets.

543
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:08,160
But first, these words
from Patriot Credit
Consolidators.

544
00:22:08,593 --> 00:22:10,162
How many times
do I have to tell you

545
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:12,664
you need to get
a comfortable chair in here.

546
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:15,467
My leg keeps falling asleep
while I'm on the air.

547
00:22:15,734 --> 00:22:16,802
Who doesn't?

548
00:22:23,308 --> 00:22:24,643
Frasier...

549
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:26,978
perhaps if you're
at Nervosa later,

550
00:22:26,978 --> 00:22:29,481
I could join you
for a cup of coffee?

551
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:32,984
Or a non-stimulating beverage?

552
00:22:34,986 --> 00:22:37,823
Please note you retain
the option to say no.

553
00:22:37,823 --> 00:22:40,158
I appreciate that.

554
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:45,163
And, in time, I believe we will
be able to establish a...

555
00:22:45,163 --> 00:22:47,499
a collegial relationship.

556
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:48,800
However, I think we
should both acknowledge

557
00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:51,069
the feelings of hostility that remain between us...

558
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:54,206
Oh, just say no.
Honestly, do you ever shut up?

559
00:22:54,506 --> 00:22:55,073
Now, see here, I..

560
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:57,075
The rich got richer
today on Wall Street.

561
00:22:57,075 --> 00:22:59,711
Not news, ordinarily,
but after their recent slide,

562
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:01,580
today's rally
in large cap

563
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:04,583
does take on a certain
"man bites dog" quality.

564
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:06,051
Speaking of dogs...
