1
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:12,512
Dad, why aren't you dressed?
It's 4:00 in the afternoon.

2
00:00:12,712 --> 00:00:14,247
Oh, I've been working nights.

3
00:00:14,247 --> 00:00:15,715
My body clock's off.

4
00:00:16,216 --> 00:00:17,784
I'm eating bacon
and eggs at night,

5
00:00:18,284 --> 00:00:19,786
and drinking beer
in the morning.

6
00:00:20,286 --> 00:00:21,588
That's what you always do.

7
00:00:21,588 --> 00:00:24,224
Yeah, but now I'm tired
all the time.

8
00:00:24,224 --> 00:00:25,558
There must
be some way

9
00:00:25,558 --> 00:00:28,061
to end this fight with your boss.

10
00:00:28,061 --> 00:00:29,396
What's the problem?

11
00:00:29,396 --> 00:00:32,232
Oh, he wants me to date
his sister, and I won't do it,

12
00:00:32,232 --> 00:00:34,067
so he's put me on graveyard until I cave.

13
00:00:34,334 --> 00:00:35,402
He can't do that.

14
00:00:35,402 --> 00:00:36,669
Why don't you file a complaint?

15
00:00:36,669 --> 00:00:39,706
I'd just as soon keep it
just between the two of us.

16
00:00:40,073 --> 00:00:41,574
I see. Is this woman
really so repulsive

17
00:00:41,574 --> 00:00:43,643
that you're willing
to sacrifice all your nights

18
00:00:43,643 --> 00:00:44,644
just to avoid
a date with her?

19
00:00:45,078 --> 00:00:46,646
Well, let me put it this way:

20
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:50,150
Years of chewing tobacco
have discolored her tooth.

21
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:51,017
(laughs)

22
00:00:53,319 --> 00:00:55,388
Someone left a book
of one-liners

23
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:56,589
in the Lost and Found.

24
00:00:58,158 --> 00:00:59,726
Hey, Fras, there's
your friend again.

25
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:01,227
MAN ( on TV ):
...have seen his top-rated show.

26
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:03,596
Dr. Phil. Now meet
Dr. Phil McGraw in person.

27
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,999
I'll be talking
about life strategies

28
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:08,501
at the State Theater
Friday through Sunday.

29
00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:10,804
Come join us.
It might just change your life.

30
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,406
Now, there's a doctor.

31
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:18,778
I never knew you were friends
with Dr. Phil.

32
00:01:18,778 --> 00:01:20,280
Some years back,
we found ourselves

33
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,284
running into each other
at seminars and conferences.

34
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:27,787
He's an excellent therapist.

35
00:01:27,787 --> 00:01:31,325
We had a bit of a clash
over ethics.

36
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:32,826
Oh, really?
Mm-hmm.

37
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:35,228
What did you do,
sleep with a patient?

38
00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:37,130
Not my ethics. His.

39
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:42,469
The man bilked me
out of $200 in a card game.

40
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:43,736
He did not bilk you.

41
00:01:43,736 --> 00:01:45,305
It's called
a one-eyed jack.

42
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:47,207
Oh, yes, yes,
there is one eye.

43
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:49,642
But the other eye is there
by implication.

44
00:01:49,642 --> 00:01:52,645
Therefore, the hand
should have been a do-over.

45
00:01:52,645 --> 00:01:55,849
And you can ask Niles
about this, too.

46
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:57,817
Far as I'm concerned,
the man owes me $200.

47
00:01:58,251 --> 00:01:59,319
This guy's so cheap,

48
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:01,821
he could squeeze a nickel
till the buffalo chokes.

49
00:02:01,821 --> 00:02:02,722
(laughs)

50
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,798
Dad, exactly how old
is this book of one-liners?

51
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:12,632
How old?

52
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:14,634
You're asking me how old?

53
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:17,003
Well, I'll tell you how old.

54
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:19,639
1956.

55
00:02:23,743 --> 00:02:25,245
Oh, Frasier,
Daphne told me

56
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:27,313
all about Dr. Phil.
Oh.

57
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:30,183
I can't believe
you know him.
Well...

58
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:31,918
You think you could
get me in backstage?

59
00:02:32,218 --> 00:02:34,087
Roz, I really hadn't
planned on seeing him.

60
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:35,555
Oh. Jealous, huh?

61
00:02:35,555 --> 00:02:38,057
Oh, it's okay, I understand.

62
00:02:38,057 --> 00:02:40,059
I am most certainly
not jealous.

63
00:02:40,059 --> 00:02:41,761
The man happens
to owe me $200.

64
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:43,096
Right.

65
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:45,098
But you know who
could help you

66
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:46,533
with your jealousy?

67
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,968
Dr. Phil.

68
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:52,639
He'd be, like...

69
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:56,643
"So your jealousy of me
has taken over your life.

70
00:02:56,643 --> 00:02:59,045
How's that working for you?"

71
00:02:59,045 --> 00:03:00,947
Yes.

72
00:03:00,947 --> 00:03:02,448
And I'd be, like...

73
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:05,785
"Fine. My money, sir."

74
00:03:05,785 --> 00:03:07,120
Oh, please?

75
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,922
Please do it for me? Please?

76
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:09,756
Well...

77
00:03:10,256 --> 00:03:11,758
all right, all right.

78
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:13,117
Oh, thank you.

79
00:03:13,117 --> 00:03:14,294
All right,
I'll see you at work.

80
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:15,795
Yeah, okay.

81
00:03:15,795 --> 00:03:16,796
Here you go.
Oh.

82
00:03:16,796 --> 00:03:19,299
I couldn't remember if you
wanted it black or not,

83
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:20,300
so I brought it
both ways.

84
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,302
Well, that's very thoughtful of you.

85
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:23,236
Thank you.

86
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:25,171
No, you might as well keep it.

87
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:26,639
You're paying for both.

88
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:28,107
Hello.

89
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:30,109
Oh, hi, Daph.

90
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:31,611
Niles.
Hello.

91
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:32,612
(gasps):
Oh, Nile
Mm-hmm?

92
00:03:33,112 --> 00:03:34,614
Look who's here.

93
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:36,983
NILES:
Oh, isn't that adorable?

94
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:38,318
See this couple?

95
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:39,819
We-we've seen them
in the park a few times.

96
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:40,820
They're so sweet together.

97
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:43,223
We like to think they're us when we're older.

98
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:45,959
Look how Old Niles

99
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:48,828
still puts his jacket around
Old Daphne's shoulders.

100
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:52,932
Ooh! She's still
a saucy little kitten.

101
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:55,501
And I'll bet he still rolls overin the middle of the night...

102
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:58,304
Yes, the picture is gotten.
Thank you.

103
00:03:58,304 --> 00:04:02,308
Oh, look. I think
I've found Old Frasier.

104
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:04,110
Oh, yeah.

105
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:10,350
I see.

106
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:14,354
Well, I hope the two of you will
understand if, in future,

107
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:16,856
I choose to knit scarves
only for myself.

108
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:18,358
Come on, we were only joking.

109
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,260
Yes, I know.
It's all in good fun.

110
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,161
Oh, Niles, I just
remembered. I've got...

111
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:25,031
Shut up!

112
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:26,199
Excuse me?

113
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:27,533
Shut up!

114
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:29,302
We're trying to knit.

115
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,709
(audience applauding)
ROZ:
Dr. Phil!

116
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:37,910
Dr. Phil,
over here!

117
00:04:38,177 --> 00:04:39,712
Roz, please!

118
00:04:39,712 --> 00:04:43,249
At least attempt
to be cool

119
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:45,151
Phil! Phil!

120
00:04:45,151 --> 00:04:47,887
Well, Frasier Crane,
is that you?

121
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:50,223
Most assuredly

122
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:51,691
Oh, that's
 you all right.

123
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:52,692
So how are you?

124
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:54,694
I'm fine, I'm fine.
How's Robin?

125
00:04:55,194 --> 00:04:56,696
She's great.
Can you believe it?

126
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:58,197
We're going on 27 years.

127
00:04:58,197 --> 00:04:59,565
Oh, congratulations.

128
00:04:59,565 --> 00:05:00,833
And how's Lilith?

129
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:04,537
Well, we've been divorced now for ten years.

130
00:05:04,537 --> 00:05:07,240
Congratulations.

131
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,575
Hi. I'm Roz Doyle.
Oh, I'm sorry. Yes.

132
00:05:09,575 --> 00:05:10,576
I'm Frasier's producer.

133
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:12,111
I just think you're wonderful.

134
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:14,614
I think your show is great,
and you're a truly wise man.

135
00:05:14,614 --> 00:05:17,085
Do you know Tom Hanks?

136
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,752
Uh... no, but thanks
for the compliment.

137
00:05:20,186 --> 00:05:21,754
Y'all come on through.

138
00:05:21,754 --> 00:05:23,256
Oh, thank you.
Thanks.

139
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:24,257
Come on.

140
00:05:24,757 --> 00:05:26,259
So, Frasier,
how's your show?

141
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:27,760
Oh, huge,
thank you.

142
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,029
We just added Spokane
last year.

143
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:32,265
And a station in Saint Paul

144
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:35,768
has agreed to let me
send them a tape.

145
00:05:35,768 --> 00:05:37,737
Can you believe,
after all that time

146
00:05:37,737 --> 00:05:38,738
we spent in the seminars,

147
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:41,174
that we both turned out
to be broadcasters?

148
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:44,110
Boy, those were
some good times,
weren't they?

149
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,545
Oh, indeed
they were.

150
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:49,482
Although sometimes
the fun and games...

151
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:51,317
were lacking in fun.

152
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:54,921
Are you still whining
about that 200 bucks?

153
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:56,756
Well, it's the principle
of the thing...

154
00:05:56,756 --> 00:05:58,257
I tell you what,
I tell you what.

155
00:05:58,257 --> 00:05:59,759
Why don't we just
discuss it over dinner?

156
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,027
Love to.
Can't.

157
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,796
I am so busy--
personal appearances,

158
00:06:03,796 --> 00:06:06,299
and book signings,
and interviews--

159
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:09,769
I've got this agent
that's got me going 25/8

160
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:12,271
In fact, speak
of the devil,
here she comes

161
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:14,273
Phil, darling!

162
00:06:14,273 --> 00:06:17,744
Oh! That was sensational!

163
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:19,011
Bebe?

164
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:21,681
Frasier!

165
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:25,952
And Roz, too.

166
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,720
You guys know each other?

167
00:06:27,987 --> 00:06:29,021
She's my agent.

168
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:29,822
And she used
to be mine.

169
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:31,724
Phil, there's a swarm
of reporters

170
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:34,060
in your dressing room
waiting to talk to you.

171
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:36,329
I probably should be going, actually

172
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:38,865
But, Roz, it was really nice to meet you.

173
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:39,832
And Frasier,

174
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:41,267
tell you what,
let's do e-mail.

175
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:42,602
Okay.

176
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:46,239
Isn't
he marvelous?

177
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,507
He's a cowboy...

178
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:51,010
wrapped in a genius,
wrapped in a dream...

179
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:54,013
wrapped in another cowboy.

180
00:06:54,013 --> 00:06:56,516
I cannot believe
that I have

181
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:58,518
the same agent as Dr. Phil!

182
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:00,019
Actually, you don't.

183
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:02,955
Somebody as big as Dr. Phil
needs all of my attention,

184
00:07:02,955 --> 00:07:05,858
but rest assured, you are being handled ably

185
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:08,828
by an agent in whom I have the utmost confidence.

186
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:10,696
Who is it?

187
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:12,999
I want to say Tim...

188
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:14,934
I think I need
 to make a phone call.

189
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:15,868
Yeah.

190
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:18,871
So, Bebe...
(chuckles)

191
00:07:18,871 --> 00:07:22,675
however did
you land Dr. Phil?

192
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:24,444
We met about a year ago

193
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:27,280
at a charity
donkey basketball game.

194
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:30,082
Donkey basketball?

195
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:31,551
Texas, darling.

196
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:34,053
It's like the symphony to them

197
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:36,889
Long story short,

198
00:07:37,156 --> 00:07:38,724
I gave him some advice

199
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:40,993
and, finally,
he hired me full-time.

200
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:42,161
Well, congratulations.

201
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:43,529
You can't imagine

202
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:45,531
the connections
I have these days.

203
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:46,866
If only you and I had...

204
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:50,903
Well...

205
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:53,906
that's water under the bridge, I guess.

206
00:07:53,906 --> 00:07:55,908
It's fun catching up, but...

207
00:07:55,908 --> 00:07:57,910
Phil's interviewing stylists for the Emmys.

208
00:07:57,910 --> 00:07:59,378
Bye, Frasier.

209
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:05,218
What a phony, huh?

210
00:08:06,552 --> 00:08:09,055
She used to be my phony.

211
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:15,661
Dad, do you think I did
the right thing changing agents?

212
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:17,129
I mean the one
I have now is fine,

213
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:19,665
but after I've seen
what Bebe's done for Phil,

214
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:21,167
I can't help wondering

215
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,603
if maybe I've denied myself access to a wider world.

216
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:28,608
Dad, are you all right?

217
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:29,942
Oh, I'm sorry.

218
00:08:29,942 --> 00:08:32,445
I... I haven't talked
to anybody for a few days.

219
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:34,947
It feels kind of strange.

220
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:38,217
Even this is making me
a little uncomfortable.

221
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,021
Dad, you have got to stop
with the graveyard shifts

222
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:44,023
or you're going to start
seeing apparitions.

223
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:46,025
No, don't worry about me. I'm pretty tough.

224
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:48,027
Listen, I'd love to stay here talking to you,

225
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:50,930
but all this sunlight
is making me dizzy.

226
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:53,232
What, you don't like the sun?

227
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:56,102
Us night-shift guys call it...

228
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:57,803
"The Scare-Ball."

229
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:02,141
(doorbell rings)

230
00:09:09,148 --> 00:09:10,483
Oh, Bebe.

231
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:11,784
Hello, darling.

232
00:09:11,784 --> 00:09:14,587
I can across this old box
of Frasier strategy memos,

233
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,390
and I thought
I'd bring them by to you.

234
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,825
Gosh, I... I didn't realize there was so much.

235
00:09:19,825 --> 00:09:22,161
And you thought I didn't work hard.

236
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:24,030
Now, now, there's no reason to take that tone.

237
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,332
Things have certainly worked out
for you, wouldn't you say?

238
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:27,667
Too true.

239
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:32,004
But... I can't be blamed for being a bit of a bitter Bebe.

240
00:09:32,004 --> 00:09:34,340
No one likes
being tossed aside for a younger woman.

241
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,841
Oh, Bebe,
you know very well

242
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:37,310
I only changed agents

243
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,845
because you were ignoring me
in favor of another client.

244
00:09:39,845 --> 00:09:41,347
I wasn't ignoring you,

245
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:43,849
I was merely getting
some much-needed
critical distance

246
00:09:43,849 --> 00:09:46,719
for a final glorious
Frasierian push!

247
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:51,557
But let's not rehash the past.

248
00:09:51,857 --> 00:09:52,925
Agreed.

249
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:54,927
We accomplished
too much together

250
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:57,330
to stop
being friends now.

251
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,198
True.

252
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,201
Frasier...

253
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:05,204
have you ever wondered
what it would be like...

254
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:07,707
if I could apply
what I've learned...

255
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:09,709
to you?

256
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:12,178
Yes, I have.

257
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:15,181
But it cannot be.

258
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:16,616
Can it?

259
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:20,553
Dangerous thoughts.

260
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:22,555
You're a siren...

261
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:24,957
luring me to the rocks.

262
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:26,392
But I must resist,

263
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:28,394
or you'll hurt me again.

264
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:29,395
No, I'm no siren!

265
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:31,731
I'm a man!
A man with ambitions!

266
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:33,566
Ambition!

267
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:37,570
The word is candy to me.

268
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,572
Damn you, devil man!

269
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:42,074
I must go!

270
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:44,076
I'm all confused and woozy!

271
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:45,344
I understand!

272
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:47,113
But what
about me?!

273
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:48,114
Very well.

274
00:10:48,614 --> 00:10:52,118
Be at my hotel
tonight for dinner.

275
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:57,456
Perhaps you'll show me
just how serious you are.

276
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:08,300
I think I've
figured it out.

277
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,802
Bebe wants to have sex
with a human male

278
00:11:10,302 --> 00:11:11,804
to bring about
the apocalypse.

279
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:17,076
Perhaps.

280
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:19,078
But here's my theory:

281
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:22,448
Bebe's had a thing for me for years.
 Mm-hmm.

282
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:24,283
This, coupled with the fact

283
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:26,786
that control is
an aphrodisiac for her,

284
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:29,288
it's not surprising to find that she hopes

285
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:34,927
to parlay her advantage
into a sexual conquest.

286
00:11:34,927 --> 00:11:37,430
the promise of wealth
and exposure

287
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:38,698
lure you
into her bed?

288
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,466
It's not going to come to that

289
00:11:40,966 --> 00:11:42,368
It's all about the dance

290
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:47,139
It's all about the possibility of sex-- the promise--

291
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:50,142
that's never delivered
that keeps them tantalized.

292
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:53,646
One only needs to know
how not to cross the line.

293
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:57,049
Excuse me, but didn't
you sleep with her once?

294
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:01,721
Yes. That's how I know
where the line is.

295
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:07,159
I almost feel sorry for her.

296
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,662
Just another helpless woman

297
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:12,631
suffering from
an unslakable thirst...

298
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:15,668
For Crane.
for Crane.

299
00:12:19,171 --> 00:12:20,673
Still, I can't
help thinking

300
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:23,175
there's something
Faustian about
this whole thing.

301
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:27,179
(chuckling):
Faust was a moron.

302
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:31,183
I'm going to be a star.

303
00:12:31,183 --> 00:12:33,152
Hi, Daph.

304
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:34,186
Hello.

305
00:12:34,186 --> 00:12:35,688
A latte, please.

306
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:36,689
Hello, darling.

307
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:37,690
Hello.

308
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,191
Did you see who's here?

309
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:40,126
Yes.

310
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:44,697
I wonder if you'll still be stirring my coffee like that

311
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:46,599
when we're in our golden years.
Yes.

312
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:49,034
And I know that a touch
from you then

313
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:51,437
will be just as sweet
as it is today.

314
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,873
So this is where
you've been going!

315
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:56,876
And with this tramp
from water aerobics!

316
00:12:58,344 --> 00:12:59,411
Who are you?

317
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:00,412
I'm his wife.

318
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:01,814
You're married?

319
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:03,048
I can explain.

320
00:13:03,048 --> 00:13:04,884
Don't bother, you worm!

321
00:13:04,884 --> 00:13:08,888
You promised that was it the last time.

322
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:18,397
(knocking on door)

323
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:20,900
Frasier, come in.

324
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,902
(distant choir singing)

325
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:24,370
How did you know it was me?

326
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:28,274
I felt a certain
tingle in the knob.

327
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:30,075
Indeed.

328
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:35,581
Well, I see Phil
has landed you

329
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:37,583
in the lap of luxury.

330
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:39,084
Yes, it's a lovely suite.

331
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:41,086
Unfortunately,
there's some sort

332
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:43,022
of choir championship
this weekend,

333
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:45,758
and they practice at all hours.

334
00:13:46,058 --> 00:13:48,127
Is it Madrigal Madness
already?

335
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:51,030
I had no idea it was
this close to Whitsun.

336
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:53,432
Please, darling, sit.

337
00:13:53,432 --> 00:13:55,434
I'll pour the champagne.

338
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:58,470
Well, I... I suppose a drop wouldn't hurt.

339
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:03,976
So... have you given any thought

340
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:05,811
to taking me on again?

341
00:14:05,811 --> 00:14:08,113
Yes, I have.

342
00:14:08,113 --> 00:14:12,418
And I have to say there's almost nothing I'd enjoy more.

343
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:14,119
Wonderful.

344
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:15,120
But first...

345
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,191
let's talk about
what I'd enjoy more.

346
00:14:20,492 --> 00:14:22,228
You want more than ten percent?

347
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:23,629
I want you.

348
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:26,131
And yes
to the other thing.

349
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:30,736
Gosh, Bebe...

350
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:32,638
I'm-I'm terribly flattered.

351
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:33,639
It-it's just that, um...

352
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:35,140
Frasier.
Hmm?

353
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:38,143
A few years ago I let down my guard

354
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:39,545
and succumbed to your advances.

355
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:40,913
You seduced me.

356
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,314
It changed me, Frasier.

357
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:46,185
If I crave your touch again,
you've only yourself to blame.

358
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:48,754
I'm not going to say that
you're not a beautiful woman.

359
00:14:48,954 --> 00:14:52,925
But is it wise for us
to jump into a relationship?

360
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:55,828
I'm only talking about having a little fun.

361
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:59,832
After all, when I'm having fun, I'm happy.

362
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:02,835
When I'm happy, I work harder.

363
00:15:03,335 --> 00:15:05,838
When I work harder, you become famous

364
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:07,339
and rich and powerful.

365
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:11,110
That's what you
want, isn't it-- fame and power?

366
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:13,913
Well, I... I like
to think of it

367
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,215
more as influence,
really, but...

368
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:19,852
I'll bet I can make you bigger than Dr. Phil.

369
00:15:20,152 --> 00:15:22,187
Is that running
water I hear?

370
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:25,658
Yes. I'm steaming the wrinkles out of a dress.

371
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:28,627
Does it put you in mind
of a tropic night...

372
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:33,065
...a moonlit stroll,

373
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:36,068
the rhythmic
lapping of waves

374
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:38,037
against the shore?

375
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:41,907
You know, if it's silk,
the steam could damage it.

376
00:15:41,907 --> 00:15:44,221
Wait right here.

377
00:15:44,221 --> 00:15:46,879
.
I'd better open a window

378
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:48,347
Yes, darling.

379
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:50,382
Let the night in

380
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:53,719
while I slip into something a little more comfortable

381
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:57,523
Well, if you want comfortable,
how about that sweater ensemble

382
00:15:57,523 --> 00:16:00,025
I saw you in this morning?

383
00:16:00,025 --> 00:16:02,895
(choir singing ominous tune )

384
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:06,098
Bebe?

385
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:07,900
Join me, Frasier.

386
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:11,403
I'll make your dreams
come true.

387
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:16,742
But... at what cost?

388
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,478
What I'm offering you
is priceless.

389
00:16:19,845 --> 00:16:21,413
Come, Frasier.

390
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:24,416
(ominous tune intensifies)

391
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:29,221
FRASIER:
I can't!

392
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:31,991
(yelling)

393
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,392
(shrieks)

394
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:40,265
(sighs heavily)

395
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:50,609
( dings )

396
00:16:57,282 --> 00:16:59,218
(chuckles softly)

397
00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:06,191
(whirring)

398
00:17:22,674 --> 00:17:25,644
(whirring)

399
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:35,154
(imitates sizzling)

400
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:40,659
Roger. You are go for liftoff.

401
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:43,162
Godspeed, Martin Six.

402
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:52,171
(microwave dings)

403
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:53,539
Oh!

404
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:55,340
Aah!

405
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:09,688
What the hell's going on?

406
00:18:09,688 --> 00:18:10,656
Oh, geez.

407
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:12,691
Just sort of a...

408
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:15,194
a... minor accident here.

409
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:16,695
But don't worry about it

410
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:18,163
Everything's under control

411
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:29,675
So, what time you want me
to pick up your sister?

412
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:34,680
Well, if it isn't the First Couple of radio.

413
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,615
I knew I could find you here.

414
00:18:37,015 --> 00:18:39,084
Bebe, shouldn't you be
in Los Angeles with Dr. Phil?

415
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:40,552
That's up
to you, Frasier.

416
00:18:40,552 --> 00:18:43,055
I don't understand.

417
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:47,059
Well, after our.
.. meeting last night

418
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:49,027
I had to ask myself a very difficult question:

419
00:18:49,394 --> 00:18:52,464
Am I really that happy
with Dr. Phil

420
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:55,267
if I'm entertaining thoughts of returning to you?

421
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:57,002
Are you saying
you'll have me back?

422
00:18:57,002 --> 00:18:58,370
How could I refuse you?

423
00:18:58,370 --> 00:18:59,805
Dr. Phil has been amusing,

424
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:02,207
but I need a project.

425
00:19:02,207 --> 00:19:03,976
I need a Frasier Crane.

426
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,744
Well, that's...
that's wonderful.

427
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:08,647
Incidentally,
Dr. Phil paid me 15%.

428
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:10,549
Well, as will Dr. Frasier.

429
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:12,551
I've just got one
very difficult call

430
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:14,052
to make to my agent.

431
00:19:14,052 --> 00:19:14,920
Already handled.

432
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:16,922
I also took the liberty
of calling Spokane.

433
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:19,258
The terms of your deal there
were worse than abysmal.

434
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:21,460
Great. Great.
You got me more money!

435
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,262
No, they wouldn't budge,
so you quit.

436
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:25,697
You're no longer on in Spokane. Isn't that exciting?

437
00:19:26,064 --> 00:19:26,932
Wait a minute.

438
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:28,200
That is a step backwards.

439
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,903
All the better
to get a running start.

440
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:32,471
In my opinion,

441
00:19:32,471 --> 00:19:36,241
the future is firmly
in front of us.

442
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:37,743
Congratulations,
Frasier.

443
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:40,245
Oh, thank you, Bebe.
Thank you so much.

444
00:19:40,245 --> 00:19:41,747
I'll call you tomorrow.

445
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:43,115
I'll be waiting.

446
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:44,950
Gosh! Roz, isn'’t that great news?

447
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:47,452
I feel like a weight
has been lifted from me.

448
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:48,787
Oh, it's marvelous!

449
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:51,690
She's charging you more money, and we just lost Spokane.

450
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:56,461
Big picture: the future is firmly in front of me.

451
00:19:56,795 --> 00:19:59,264
Isn't the future
always in front of you?

452
00:19:59,264 --> 00:20:03,135
Yes... but not firmly.

453
00:20:07,606 --> 00:20:08,540
Well, my little lamb

454
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,609
has bleated his way back to me

455
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:13,845
So my debt i

456
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:15,847
We don't have to keep
pretending you're my agent?

457
00:20:15,847 --> 00:20:17,316
We're square, darling.

458
00:20:17,816 --> 00:20:19,818
And maybe next time
you gamble with Bebe...

459
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:22,321
you'll pay your debts
with cash.

460
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:23,822
See, the problem is,

461
00:20:23,822 --> 00:20:25,824
my wife looks
at the bank statements,

462
00:20:25,824 --> 00:20:28,827
and if she knew I was
losing money playing cards,

463
00:20:28,827 --> 00:20:30,662
she would kill me.

464
00:20:30,662 --> 00:20:35,000
So, your wife doesn't know you play poker?

465
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,502
I don't tell her everything.

466
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:38,837
I see.

467
00:20:39,104 --> 00:20:42,975
And how's that
working for you?

468
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:45,544
Just deal the cards.
