1
00:00:08,074 --> 00:00:11,077
Gosh, it's been such fun

2
00:00:11,077 --> 00:00:13,079
talking about
psychopharmacological solutions

3
00:00:13,079 --> 00:00:15,081
to maladaptive
personality traits

4
00:00:15,081 --> 00:00:17,984
that I can't believe
the three hours is almost gone.

5
00:00:17,984 --> 00:00:20,420
Up next is the news
followed by...

6
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,690
Oh... Roz is reminding me

7
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:28,895
that next Saturday is the first
annual KACL AIDS Bike-a-thon.

8
00:00:29,462 --> 00:00:30,463
It's bound to be an afternoon

9
00:00:30,964 --> 00:00:33,466
of family, fun
and lots of surprises.

10
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:39,439
So dust off your velocipedes,
and I'll see you there.

11
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:40,940
Great pitch, Doc.

12
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:42,308
So what are the surprises?

13
00:00:42,776 --> 00:00:45,845
Well, first and foremost, I'm not going.

14
00:00:45,845 --> 00:00:47,747
But you just told them
you'd see them there.

15
00:00:48,114 --> 00:00:50,183
Roz, I'm merely getting
the rubes into the tent.

16
00:00:50,683 --> 00:00:51,684
I will gladly give my money,

17
00:00:51,684 --> 00:00:53,686
but spending the afternoon
riding bicycles

18
00:00:53,686 --> 00:00:55,989
with a bunch of hooligans
is not my idea of fun.

19
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:58,091
It's just kids and families.

20
00:00:58,324 --> 00:01:00,894
Yes, well, so was the KACL
family picnic at the zoo,

21
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:04,798
until those urchins jostled me
into the orangutan grove.

22
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:06,699
Let me tell you,

23
00:01:06,699 --> 00:01:10,670
orangutans are not the playful
gentlemen of the trees

24
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:12,672
the nature shows claim.

25
00:01:12,672 --> 00:01:13,640
Hello.

26
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,175
Hey, Julia.

27
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:17,177
You're going to
the Bike-a-thon, right?

28
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:19,012
Oh, don't embarrass her, Kenny.

29
00:01:19,012 --> 00:01:21,848
It's got to be tough
finding a comfortable bike seat

30
00:01:21,848 --> 00:01:24,184
when you're such a tight-ass
.

31
00:01:24,184 --> 00:01:29,289
This from a woman who peddles
her ass all over town.

32
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:30,523
Okay, lady...
Yes, all right
Stalemate.

33
00:01:31,057 --> 00:01:33,493
Well done, well done, keep moving, come on.

34
00:01:33,493 --> 00:01:35,562
So, Bike-a-thon--
you're in, right?

35
00:01:35,562 --> 00:01:36,996
Nah, I can't be bothered.

36
00:01:37,564 --> 00:01:39,532
I'll just send a check.

37
00:01:39,532 --> 00:01:41,468
Aw, cheese and rice,
what's wrong with you people?

38
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:43,436
Relax, Kenny,
I'm just pulling your leg.

39
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:44,938
How can I not go?

40
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:47,740
This is funding AIDS research,
for God's sake.

41
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,075
I know you think
I'm heartless

42
00:01:49,075 --> 00:01:50,376
and self-centered,

43
00:01:50,376 --> 00:01:52,576
but at least give me credit
for being human.

44
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:56,883
What?

45
00:01:56,883 --> 00:01:58,885
Kenny... (chuckles)

46
00:01:58,885 --> 00:02:00,353
Come on.

47
00:02:00,353 --> 00:02:02,255
I was pulling your leg, too.

48
00:02:02,255 --> 00:02:04,090
(laughs):
Come on.

49
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:04,891
I'll tell you what.

50
00:02:05,391 --> 00:02:08,728
We should have a fund-raiser
for your sense of humor.

51
00:02:08,728 --> 00:02:09,596
(guffaws)

52
00:02:09,596 --> 00:02:12,599
All right, I'll see you there.

53
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:13,566
You're pathetic.

54
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:15,068
I know

55
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:21,207
Hold it!

56
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:27,714
Cora, hi.

57
00:02:28,214 --> 00:02:29,015
Marty.

58
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:36,789
Visiting your son?

59
00:02:36,789 --> 00:02:37,790
Yes.

60
00:02:41,794 --> 00:02:43,730
Cora, I'm sorry,
but I got to ask you.

61
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:45,665
What happened?

62
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,667
I thought we had
a pretty nice thing,

63
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,102
but then you stopped
returning my calls.

64
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:52,005
Why don't you ask
your other girlfriend?

65
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:54,007
What other girlfriend?

66
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,977
That bizarre English lady who
told me to leave you alone...

67
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:01,848
...because she was in
the British Secret Service

68
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,783
and had a license to kill.

69
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:06,686
Here's your stop.

70
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:09,689
Oh, geez!
That was Daphne's mother.

71
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:13,059
She had a thing for me,
but it was never mutual.

72
00:03:13,059 --> 00:03:14,460
Did she show you a badge?

73
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:17,397
Always ask to see a badge.

74
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:20,366
I knew she wasn't
a secret agent.

75
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:23,670
But she was pretty convincing
about the two of you.

76
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,471
Oh, Cora, I'm so sorry.

77
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:28,241
It's not true.

78
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:31,477
I'm sorry, too.

79
00:03:32,011 --> 00:03:34,514
I should have
asked about her.

80
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:37,016
Well, hey,
it's cleared up now.

81
00:03:37,016 --> 00:03:40,019
Maybe we could pick up
where we left off.

82
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:43,356
Or skip ahead.
Your choice.

83
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:45,158
That would've been nice

84
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:47,460
but I've been
seeing someone lately.

85
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,761
Oh, well, sure.
Of course you have.

86
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:50,196
Stupid of me.

87
00:03:50,196 --> 00:03:52,665
But I'm very
 glad to see you again.

88
00:03:52,665 --> 00:03:54,167
Please give Eddie my love.

89
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:55,668
Oh, yeah.

90
00:03:55,668 --> 00:03:57,470
He'll be sorry
he missed you.

91
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:00,206
He liked your ankles.

92
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:15,221
Oh, sorry for
the holdup, guys.

93
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:16,723
Listen, I think it's best

94
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:18,725
if we take separate cars
to the flower show.

95
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:20,560
Later, I have to go
buy a bicycle.

96
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,328
NILES:
For whom?

97
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:24,197
Well, for me.

98
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:28,134
I've beendragooned into riding
for the KACL AIDS Bike-a-thon.

99
00:04:28,134 --> 00:04:31,070
Poor devil.
Spending a day on a bike.

100
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:34,073
I don't envy you.

101
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:35,408
DAPHNE:
Niles...

102
00:04:35,808 --> 00:04:38,211
why don't we enter
the Bike-a-thon.

103
00:04:40,813 --> 00:04:43,750
You had to see that coming.

104
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:46,419
We can all go to the shop
together after the flower show.

105
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:47,754
Sure, why not?

106
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:49,756
You two would look so cute

107
00:04:50,256 --> 00:04:51,257
on matching bicycles.

108
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:53,259
Well, I guess it would be
a kick, eh, Frasier?

109
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:55,261
Not you two, you nit.

110
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:56,663
You and Daphne.

111
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:01,434
You!

112
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:02,769
Hello.

113
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:03,770
I just had
a very interesting

114
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,772
conversation with Cora Winston.

115
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:09,242
Seems someone claiming to be
my girlfriend scared her off.

116
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:10,677
Oh, dear.

117
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:12,145
Is she the woman
from the bookstore?

118
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,147
No.

119
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,649
The bookstore?!

120
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:18,117
Mum, is this true?

121
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:21,421
Well, I'm sure I don't
 know what Marty's talking about

122
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:23,556
but it was probably back
when we were an item.

123
00:05:23,556 --> 00:05:25,958
We were never an item!

124
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:26,959
Now I would like for you
to leave.

125
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:28,361
Now, Dad, calm down.

126
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:30,763
Listen, I'm sure you can talk this over with Cora

127
00:05:30,763 --> 00:05:32,265
and have a good laugh after it.

128
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:34,067
Ha, ha.
Very funny.

129
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:36,302
Now that she's practically married to this guy.

130
00:05:36,302 --> 00:05:37,804
Oh, Martin, I'm sorry.

131
00:05:38,304 --> 00:05:39,305
I guess I didn't realize..

132
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:40,807
Apology not accepted.

133
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:43,109
You went too far.
We are no longer speaking.

134
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:45,445
Marty...
No, no, Mrs. Moon,
Mrs. Moon...

135
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:46,946
shut up.

136
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:52,352
Uh, Dad, we're leaving now

137
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:54,120
We're going over
to the flower show,

138
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,388
then, after that,
we're gonna go

139
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:56,889
to a sporting goods store
and buy a couple of bikes.

140
00:05:57,323 --> 00:05:59,892
Nice try, Frasier,
but I'm too mad to laugh

141
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:07,633
Uh, well, this one
has good lines.

142
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:09,469
You have any
without this bar here?

143
00:06:12,338 --> 00:06:14,240
You mean girls' bikes? Sure.

144
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:18,511
Good. 'Cause my wife’s a girl and she'll need one of those.

145
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:19,912
Right.

146
00:06:19,912 --> 00:06:21,347
Maybe I'll go see
how she's doing.

147
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:25,418
Niles, we can't stall much longer.

148
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:27,920
I mean, one seems
as good as the next.

149
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,888
Is there anything else we need?

150
00:06:29,288 --> 00:06:31,357
Hmm, let me see...
Oh, yes, I know.

151
00:06:31,357 --> 00:06:32,859
We need to know
how to ride them!

152
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:34,761
Shh! Shh! Shh!

153
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:36,462
We will learn.

154
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:37,663
Oh, as easy as that?

155
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:39,098
Look at these machines,
Frasier.

156
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:41,467
These are bicycles.

157
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:43,336
There's nothing between
you and the ground
but the ground itself.

158
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:44,670
Yes.

159
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:47,707
And if a child of four
can ride one, then so can we.

160
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:50,977
That's what we said
when we were six.

161
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:53,413
If Daphne finds out,
she'll probably...

162
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:57,350
Metal spokes.
I like that.

163
00:06:57,717 --> 00:06:59,786
Guess you buy the horn
separately.

164
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:05,892
That was close.

165
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:08,928
Niles, I am not going to look like an idiot

166
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,196
at that Bike-a-thon.

167
00:07:10,396 --> 00:07:12,465
Tonight, I'm going to a parking lot

168
00:07:12,465 --> 00:07:13,966
and come hell or high water,

169
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:16,969
I am going
to master cycling.

170
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:18,938
You're welcome to join me.

171
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:21,441
I guess I could sneak out.

172
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,409
Perhaps it's time
to slay the dragon.

173
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:24,877
That's the stuff, brother.

174
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:29,749
Call me crazy,
but I like a bouncy tire.

175
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:34,220
Two bouncy tires and a taut chain.

176
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,989
That's good ridin'.

177
00:07:38,257 --> 00:07:39,759
Where did you
learn all that?

178
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:42,762
That was really good.

179
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:44,263
It's a matter
of confidence, Niles.

180
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:46,199
Hmm!

181
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,101
(groans)

182
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:53,039
All a matter of
confidence, he says.

183
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:56,442
Well, perhaps two people who
don't know how to ride bikes

184
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:59,479
shouldn't try
to teach each other.

185
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,380
A good teacher doesn't
yell at his student.

186
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:05,117
Nor does a good teacher
throw a stick at his student.

187
00:08:05,117 --> 00:08:07,420
I thought it would
make you try harder.

188
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:10,122
Oh, you're going to make
a hell of a dad.

189
00:08:10,122 --> 00:08:11,958
What are we going to do?

190
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:13,292
Let's not panic.

191
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:15,294
We still have two days
before the Bike-a-thon.

192
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:19,198
Surely the library has shelves
devoted to this topic.

193
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:20,600
I don't have time for that

194
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,369
Daphne wants to go biking
tomorrow afternoon.

195
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:27,206
Then you'll just have to tell
her you don't know how to ride

196
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:28,207
If I was going to do that,

197
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:29,709
I should've done it
at the bike store.

198
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:31,711
But no...!

199
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:33,079
You...!

200
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:34,981
You said we could teach
ourselves.

201
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:36,949
You said no one
would be the wiser.

202
00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:38,284
Niles...
Two bouncy tires

203
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:39,619
and a taut chain, you said.

204
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:41,120
And now look!

205
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,589
My spokes are bent,
my pants are stuck,

206
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:44,991
there's blood
on the headlight!

207
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:45,825
There's blood everywhere!

208
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:48,794
Niles, Niles, Niles.

209
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:52,798
Niles, that wasn't your fault.

210
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:57,703
That jogger should've
been wearing a reflective vest.

211
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:59,639
Come on... come and sit down.

212
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:01,641
I'm going to get you a nice sherry.

213
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:13,185
Hi, Frasier.
Oh, hi, Roz.

214
00:09:13,185 --> 00:09:15,187
You're welcome
to join me and Niles.

215
00:09:15,187 --> 00:09:16,188
Oh, I can't.

216
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:18,691
I'm on my way to meet Alice and her sitter

217
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:21,694
Alice wants to practice riding her bicycle for Saturday.

218
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:22,628
Really?
Mm-hmm.

219
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:24,030
She loves it.

220
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,032
She had that bike one day

221
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:29,535
before she made me
take her training wheels off.

222
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:32,538
Tell me, does she ever
find that she feels

223
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:37,043
as though her feet
are frozen to the pedals...

224
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:40,046
stuck in a confused,
arrhythmic battle

225
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:42,048
between forward
and reverse,

226
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:45,051
until finally,
with no locomotive
momentum whatsoever,

227
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:47,420
she keels over
like a felled tree?

228
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:49,322
I don't think so.

229
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:50,823
Oh, good, good,

230
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:52,825
because that's
a real thing

231
00:09:52,825 --> 00:09:54,260
that happens
to some kids.

232
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:57,763
DAPHNE:
Hey, Frasier.

233
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:59,765
Oh, hi, Daph.
Mrs. Moon.

234
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,267
Niles, darling

235
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,269
I'm afraid I
 have some bad news.

236
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,103
NILES:
What is it?

237
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:07,707
Someone stole our new bikes.

238
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,509
My God, are you sure?

239
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:11,377
Can I get a refill?

240
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:14,747
That's terrible.

241
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:15,615
That's curious, Niles.

242
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:16,949
Didn't that salesman say

243
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:19,852
that nothing could break
those titanium locks?

244
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:21,287
You're right.

245
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:23,289
I must not have locked them
properly.

246
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:27,126
Foolish Niles.

247
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:29,462
You know, I spotted
a couple of bikes

248
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,464
in the storage room
behind the furnace.

249
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:33,466
Perhaps you could borrow those.

250
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:34,967
No, I don't think so.

251
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:37,436
The theft has soured me
on the whole bike experience.

252
00:10:37,436 --> 00:10:39,438
And what were you doing
behind the furnace, anyway?

253
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:42,141
Drinking.

254
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:45,478
Hello, Daphne,
Niles, Frasier.

255
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:46,479
Hello, Martin.

256
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,481
How are the three
of you doing?

257
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,483
Mind if I join you?

258
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:51,384
NILES:
Sure.

259
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:54,153
Oh, you're not still angry,
are you?

260
00:10:54,553 --> 00:10:57,623
Coffee, please.

261
00:10:57,623 --> 00:11:01,127
Hi. Well, everybody's
here today.

262
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:02,028
Yeah.

263
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:02,828
Grab a seat.

264
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,331
I'd love to have
a lady sit next to me.

265
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:06,332
ROZ:
Well, thanks. I can't.

266
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:07,733
I'm on my way to the park.

267
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:09,669
I just got a call
from the baby-sitter.

268
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,170
Alice did a wheelie!

269
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,673
(all exclaiming)

270
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,675
Well, I'll see you guys later.

271
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,009
That's great, Roz.
Bye-bye.

272
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:20,279
Well, someone's raising
a real little showoff.

273
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:23,716
Now, now, not everyone
was meant to ride a bike.

274
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:25,217
What does that mean?

275
00:11:25,217 --> 00:11:27,219
Well, I'm just saying
that my boys

276
00:11:27,219 --> 00:11:28,721
are good at other things.

277
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:30,156
Indoor things.

278
00:11:33,492 --> 00:11:34,894
Oh, no.

279
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:35,861
You don't mean...

280
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:37,363
Yes, Daphne.

281
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,131
Frasier doesn't know
how to ride a bike.

282
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:41,967
Well, neither do you!

283
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:42,735
Frasier!

284
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:45,204
Well, she was bound
to find out!

285
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:47,039
We never learned.

286
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:48,374
I tried teaching them,

287
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,376
but I had to take them to
the hospital so many times

288
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:53,813
Social Services starte
d sniffing around.

289
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,917
All these years,
it's been our secret shame.

290
00:11:58,317 --> 00:12:00,386
Yes, and it hasn't been easy concealing it, either.

291
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:01,887
People are always saying,
in conversation,

292
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:03,322
"It's just like riding a bike."

293
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:07,526
I can smile and nod...

294
00:12:07,526 --> 00:12:11,397
but I only understand it
in theory.

295
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:15,067
We tried to teach ourselves
to ride last night.

296
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:17,069
Oh, can you imagine
a sadder tableau?

297
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:19,071
Two grown men
trying to gain mastery

298
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,840
over a child's toy

299
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,141
and failing miserably.

300
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:23,509
Even more pathetic

301
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:25,377
a grown man
faking the theft

302
00:12:25,377 --> 00:12:27,379
of his and his
wife's bicycles.

303
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:30,883
I disgust myself!

304
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:32,384
I'm so sorry, Daphne.

305
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:34,386
Niles, you've no
 need to apologize.

306
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:35,888
Lots of people
don't know how to ride.

307
00:12:35,888 --> 00:12:37,156
Really?

308
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:38,257
Who?

309
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:40,559
It doesn't matter.

310
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:42,995
I can take you to the park
and teach you.

311
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:43,896
I'll teach you both.

312
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:45,731
Yeah.
Really, Daphne?

313
00:12:45,731 --> 00:12:47,600
Daphne, I adore you!

314
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,536
No, seriously. Who?

315
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:52,938
Thank you, Daphne.

316
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:54,440
You know
I'm afraid my bike

317
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,941
may be too
damaged to ride.

318
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:58,844
Oh, so we'll borrow one from someone in the building.

319
00:12:58,844 --> 00:13:00,246
I promise you,

320
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:02,748
you two are going to
learn how to ride bikes.

321
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:04,583
MARTIN:
You're a good wife,
Daphne.

322
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,452
And I'll bet you
 were a good daughter

323
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:07,953
when your mother
was alive.

324
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:21,834

326
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:24,303
Pads.

327
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:25,304

Check.

330
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:32,444
All right, now, remember,
keep your eyes open

331
00:13:32,444 --> 00:13:34,713
and pedal quickly.

332
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:35,981
I just want to get an idea

333
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:37,483
of your individual skill levels.

334
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:39,785
DAPHNE:
All right,
everyone ready,

335
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:41,987
and... go!

336
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,991
Okay... good start.

337
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:46,959
Now, let's try again.

338
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:48,794
But this time further apart.

339
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,134
Okay.

340
00:13:55,467 --> 00:13:57,436
I-I think... this is going
to be all right.

341
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:58,838
Yeah, yeah, this isn't so bad.

342
00:13:58,838 --> 00:13:59,605
DAPHNE: All right,

343
00:13:59,805 --> 00:14:01,874
and... go.

344
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,847
Yes, very... yes!

345
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,882
(Niles screams)

346
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:12,885

350
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:18,284
It's that
damn sycamore.

351
00:15:18,717 --> 00:15:21,120
It's got a magnetic
hold on me.

352
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:22,922
That's because
you're focusing on it.

353
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,390
Whatever you do,
put it out of your mind.

354
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:30,863
You're a cloud
scudding across
a clear blue

I'm a cloud.
You're a cloud.

00:15:32,731 --> 00:15:34,233
I'm a cloud.
You're a cloud.

I'm a cloud... I'm a cloud

I am a cloud!
I'm flying!

359
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:44,777
Look, I'm riding a bike!

(doorbell rings)

363
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:03,629
I heard you. I'm coming.

364
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,632
Hello.

365
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:09,635
(loud knocking)

366
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,637
Oh, geez.

367
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:17,009
Look, I'm sorry,
I'm still ticked.

368
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:19,845
I'm not proud of it, but I have to do the right thing,

369
00:16:19,845 --> 00:16:21,347
and that means hold this grudge.

370
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:23,315
Ha! You're talking to me

371
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:24,583
I knew you would.

372
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:30,456
Oh, you're here to see Marty?

373
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:31,957
Actually, I think not.

374
00:16:31,957 --> 00:16:35,260
No, no, this isn't what it looks like

375
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:37,997
I'm here to apologize.

376
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,999
But since he's not
talking to me,

377
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,500
I guess
I can say my piece to you.

378
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:44,003
Now, first of all, don't be scared.

379
00:16:44,436 --> 00:16:46,005
I'm not a secret agent

380
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:48,340
and I don't have
a license to kill.

381
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:52,011
Back when I said
all that to you,

382
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,546
I wasn't really in
my right mind, anyway.

383
00:16:54,546 --> 00:16:57,516
I mean, I'd just separated from my husband,

384
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:59,018
and well, maybe I hoped Marty

385
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:03,022
would be some kind
of knight in shining armor.

386
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:05,858
But we were never
a couple, though.

387
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:08,727
It was a pretty rotten
thing you did.

388
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:10,195
Yes, I know, dear.

389
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:11,230
Just awful.

390
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:15,034
In my defense,
I've done much worse.

391
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:19,872
And besides, between you and
the girl at the bookstore,

392
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:24,209
I liked you better

393
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:25,577
(doorbell ringing)

394
00:17:25,577 --> 00:17:27,546
Son of a bitch.

395
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:33,852
Cora.

396
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:35,621
Hi. Come on in

397
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:36,555
Hi.

398
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:38,624
I ran into a friend
of yours.

399
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:40,059
She's no friend of mine.

400
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:43,128
Well, she had
some nice things
to say about you.

401
00:17:43,128 --> 00:17:45,130
Maybe we could talk
about it

402
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:47,666
at dinner tomorrow.

403
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:50,436
I don't see him here.

404
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:52,271
I guess not.

405
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:54,139
Pick you up at 7:00?

406
00:17:54,139 --> 00:17:56,041
7:00 it is.

407
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:59,978
So, uh, who's this girl
from the bookstore?

408
00:17:59,978 --> 00:18:01,413
See you tomorrow.

409
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:12,991
Never thought
I'd see the day.

410
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:14,493
This is really something.

411
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:15,994
That's right.

412
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:16,995
You've faced
your fears

413
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:18,497
and you've
bested them.

414
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:19,398
Yeah, thanks
to you.

415
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:21,767
And who knows, maybe this
is just the beginning.

416
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,769
There are still
mountains to conquer.

417
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,270
The diving board,
for instance.

418
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,772
Or cartwheels.

419
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,273
Be careful out there, son.

420
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:29,274
I will, Dad.
Thanks.

421
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:30,776
Guess I better
 go take my place, huh?

422
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:31,610
Okay.
All right.

423
00:18:35,347 --> 00:18:36,915
Kenny, Julia.

424
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:37,916
Hey, Doc.
Hi.

425
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:39,384
Have a good ride.

426
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:40,686
Not gonna happen.

427
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:43,455
These shorts are already
bunching me something fierce.

428
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:44,957
Excuse me.

429
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,627
Pretty exciting.

430
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:50,028
Thrilling.

431
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:51,864
You don't mind if we don't ride together, do you?

432
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:53,365
I like to go
at my own pace

433
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:55,367
No, not at all.

434
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:56,735
You don't have to feel like
you have to keep up.

435
00:18:57,035 --> 00:18:59,104
(chuckles)

436
00:18:59,104 --> 00:19:01,440
Right. Well, what do you
say we make it interesting?

437
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,108
What do you
have in mind?

438
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:05,377
Last one to cross the finish line

439
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:08,447
doubles the
other's pledges.

440
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:12,651
And I look forward
to watching you write
that big fat check.

441
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:13,886
NILES:
Frasier.

442
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:15,287
Remember, keep
your eye on the road

443
00:19:15,787 --> 00:19:17,656
and don't fixate on anything you
can crash into.

444
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:18,524
Right.

445
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:19,925
Good luck.

446
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:21,360
(starting gun fires)

447
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:25,297

steer around

448

449
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,134
Ciao.

450
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:42,814
Frasier?

451
00:19:42,814 --> 00:19:44,316
Are you okay?

452
00:19:44,316 --> 00:19:45,817
I'll be all right.
