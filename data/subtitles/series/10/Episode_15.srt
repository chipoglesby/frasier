1
00:00:08,742 --> 00:00:09,743
Ooh, Niles,
sorry I'm late.

2
00:00:09,743 --> 00:00:10,744
Did you sign us up?

3
00:00:10,744 --> 00:00:12,190
Frasier,
I've been thinking.

4
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:14,414
How many years
have we teamed up
for the squash tournament

5
00:00:14,914 --> 00:00:16,182
only to be eliminated in the second round?

6
00:00:16,383 --> 00:00:17,450
Nine.

7
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:18,351
Exactly.

8
00:00:18,718 --> 00:00:19,786
Don't you think

9
00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:21,654
it's time we came up
with a new strategy?

10
00:00:21,955 --> 00:00:23,523
Niles, if you're talking
about taking that powder

11
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:25,025
that's made from
sheep's glands,

12
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,393
the answer is never again.

13
00:00:26,726 --> 00:00:28,795
Well, actually, I was
thinking of something
more fundamental.

14
00:00:29,295 --> 00:00:30,797
It occurs to me that
after nine years...

15
00:00:30,797 --> 00:00:33,133
Shh-shh, Niles,
here comes that two-faced
braggart, Jim Blake.

16
00:00:33,466 --> 00:00:35,535
Jim, looking good.

17
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:36,436
Thanks, Frasier, thanks.

18
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:38,338
So, you signed up
for the tournament?

19
00:00:38,338 --> 00:00:39,839
Uh, I don't know.

20
00:00:39,839 --> 00:00:41,841
Have we, partner?

21
00:00:44,411 --> 00:00:45,445
Awesome, awesome.

22
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:46,446
Let's do it.

23
00:00:46,946 --> 00:00:47,947
I'll see you
on the court, bro.

24
00:00:54,954 --> 00:00:56,456
It's not what
it looks like.

25
00:00:56,456 --> 00:00:57,891
It's exactly
what it looks like.

26
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:59,826
You've teamed up
with someone younger
and in better shape.

27
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:00,894
No, Frasier, you know I don't care

28
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:02,462
about such superficial things

29
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:03,797
You know, that Jim
is bad news.

30
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:04,664
He struts around here

31
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:07,167
in those ridiculous looking
Swedish goggles

32
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:08,968
that everybody thinks
are so cool.

33
00:01:08,968 --> 00:01:12,305
Jim...

34
00:01:12,305 --> 00:01:14,307
You know, I just wish
you'd told me sooner

35
00:01:14,307 --> 00:01:15,809
instead of waiting
until the last minute.

36
00:01:16,309 --> 00:01:18,178
Does Jim know you're
passive-aggressive?

37
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:21,581
Believe me, neither Jim nor I expected this to happen.

38
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:22,582
Our games just meshed.

39
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:23,583
We would've
teamed up sooner

40
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:25,085
but the timing
was never right.

41
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:26,586
Either Jim was with a squash partner

42
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:27,987
or I was playing with you...

43
00:01:27,987 --> 00:01:30,390
Fine, go, just go, go,
go to your new partner.

44
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:31,691
I don't care.
Who needs you?

45
00:01:34,527 --> 00:01:35,962
Niles...

46
00:01:36,296 --> 00:01:37,864
Don't forget to wear
your wrist brace.

47
00:01:37,864 --> 00:01:40,633
You know how easily you sprain.

48
00:01:46,005 --> 00:01:48,308
Hi... Frasier.

49
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:49,576
Chelsea Gray.

50
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:51,044
We met a few
months ago.
Oh.. yes!

51
00:01:51,544 --> 00:01:53,379
You were kicking
the Gatorade machine.

52
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,214
Of course,
I remember.

53
00:01:54,747 --> 00:01:56,249
I had inserted my dollar bill

54
00:01:56,249 --> 00:01:58,751
with Washington's face up, as per the diagram

55
00:01:58,751 --> 00:02:00,053
and was vended nothing

56
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,387
Did you ever write that letter?

57
00:02:01,387 --> 00:02:02,388
Indeed, I did.

58
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:03,890
The matter still pends

59
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:05,391
Ah.

60
00:02:05,391 --> 00:02:06,893
So did you sign up
for the tournament?

61
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:10,196
Well, I was going to,
but, uh...

62
00:02:10,196 --> 00:02:11,898
I just found out
my customary partner

63
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:13,733
has made other plans this year.

64
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:16,870
Well, would you
be interested in playing mixed doubles?

65
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,138
I'm a girls' PE teacher

66
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,540
so it'd be nice to play
with a guy for a change.

67
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:23,409
Thanks for the offer, but after
what I've just been through,

68
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:24,911
I'm not sure I'm ready
to partner up again.

69
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:26,312
That's too bad.

70
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:27,747
I've seen you play.

71
00:02:27,747 --> 00:02:29,749
We'd make a good team.

72
00:02:29,749 --> 00:02:32,085
You already resorting to playing
with the girls, Frasier?

73
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:33,920
(chuckles):
No offense, sweetie.

74
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,889
(clicks tongue)

75
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:38,224
Excuse me.

76
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:42,428
(screeches):
Ow!

77
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:45,765
Nice shot, partner.

78
00:02:55,408 --> 00:02:56,910
Here we are.

79
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:57,911
Hello, all.
Hi.

80
00:02:58,411 --> 00:03:01,247
You'll never guess who just won their squash tournament.

81
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:03,850
If only we had a big, shiny clue.

82
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:06,386
MARTIN:
Oh, hey, that's great news.

83
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:08,121
Congratulations.

84
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:10,356
Well, I owe it all
to my partner.

85
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:11,624
Oh, thank you, partner

86
00:03:11,624 --> 00:03:13,626
But I think it's really due to our partnership

87
00:03:13,626 --> 00:03:15,028
Aha, well...

88
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:18,431
now you know what they say,
there's no "I" in "team."

89
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:21,734
Like there is in "Niles."

90
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:23,803
FRASIER:
So here, Dad...

91
00:03:24,003 --> 00:03:25,071
check it out.

92
00:03:25,071 --> 00:03:27,073
Wow, would you look at that

93
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:28,575
I didn't think
 I'd ever see the day

94
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:30,076
one of my boys
would win a trophy

95
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:32,512
that didn't have a book on it.

96
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,314
Now all that's left
on my list

97
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:37,183
is shake hands with Hank Aaron,
kiss Sally Field on the mouth

98
00:03:37,183 --> 00:03:40,053
and then I can go on
and be with your mother.

99
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:43,456
You know, Jim and I may have
our own trophy soon.

100
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:45,458
We're still alive in
the men's doubles bracket.

101
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:46,926
Oh, please, Niles,

102
00:03:46,926 --> 00:03:48,428
your partner couldn't
be carrying you any more

103
00:03:48,928 --> 00:03:49,929
if he put you in a Snugli

104
00:03:49,929 --> 00:03:53,299
and strapped you
to his stomach.

105
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,168
Well, I'm proud of
both of you.

106
00:03:55,668 --> 00:03:57,170
And squash might not be
the toughest of sports

107
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:58,671
but it's still
technically a sport.

108
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:00,006
CHELSEA:
What?

109
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,808
Squash can be pretty tough.

110
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:03,276
Ha.
Oh, no, n-no, no.

111
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:06,312
I once saw a guy break his leg
in a mid-court collision.

112
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:08,114
The bone was poking
through his skin

113
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:10,416
and he still finished the point.

114
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,151
That's the game you guys play?

115
00:04:12,151 --> 00:04:14,988
Hell, yeah.

116
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:16,422
CHELSEA:
Frasier.

117
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:18,191
do you mind if I use
your phone?

118
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:18,992
No, of course not.

119
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:20,326
Come use the one
in the other room.

120
00:04:20,326 --> 00:04:21,794
That'll give you some privacy.

121
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:24,297
After you, my lady.

122
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:28,301
You know, Dad, when Jim and I
win our trophies,

123
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:30,169
I think I'm going
to give mine to you.

124
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:31,504
Thank you, son.

125
00:04:31,504 --> 00:04:33,506
But I don't want you
moping around here

126
00:04:33,506 --> 00:04:35,008
if your brother wins one
and you don't.

127
00:04:35,508 --> 00:04:37,510
Oh, please, Dad, I'm a little
 more mature than that.

128
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:40,780
No, you're not.

129
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,950
It still bugs you that his name
comes first alphabetically.

130
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,785
Well, that was your fault.

131
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,189
Your girlfriend seems nice.

132
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:54,193
She is nice,
but she's certainly
not my girlfriend.

133
00:04:54,193 --> 00:04:56,195
I do find her attractive, but...

134
00:04:56,195 --> 00:04:59,966
I'm not sure I'm anything
more than a teammate to her.

135
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:03,269
Well, from what I've seen, I'd say she likes you a lot.

136
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:04,570
Really?

137
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:05,838
She did kiss me once.

138
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:08,341
But I think that was just
in an overflow of emotion

139
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:09,842
after one of our victories.

140
00:05:09,842 --> 00:05:12,278
You know, I suppose that happens
all the time on sports teams.

141
00:05:12,278 --> 00:05:14,714
It doesn't.

142
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:19,018
Of course, I can't speak
for the Canadian leagues.

143
00:05:19,018 --> 00:05:20,853
Well, truth be told,
now that there's not

144
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:24,724
the excitement of the tournament
to fuel the fires...

145
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:26,559
I don't think we really
have much in common

146
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:27,827
in the real world.

147
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:32,031
You have your
ostentatious trophies.

148
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:34,467
Well, it was good seeing you
all, but I have to get going.

149
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:36,469
Oh, so soon?
You just got here.

150
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:37,937
I have an early faculty meeting.

151
00:05:38,404 --> 00:05:39,472
FRASIER:
I'll walk you out.

152
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:42,241
MARTIN: Come back!

153
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:43,242
DAPHNE:
Bye-bye.

154
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:45,078
Bye.
Bye.
Congratulations.

155
00:05:48,981 --> 00:05:50,416
Well, I, uh.

156
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:52,485
I certainly had a great
time the last few weeks.

157
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:54,487
Yeah, me, too.

158
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:57,490
Call me again, if you
want to play sometime.

159
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:05,064
I don't suppose you'd
to take this to the next level?

160
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:09,302
Oh, I gave up my
dream of professional squash years ago.

161
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:13,773
That's not what I meant.

162
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:17,777
Um... maybe I could think of
another way to put it.

163
00:06:34,627 --> 00:06:35,628
Oh, hi, Daph.

164
00:06:35,628 --> 00:06:37,130
Hey, I didn't expect
to see you here.

165
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,432
Niles said you were
going out with Chelsea.

166
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:41,234
Oh, yes, yes-- I just thought I'd stopby

167
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,536
for a quick pick-me-
up before I pick her up

168
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:45,238
Does she laugh
at that kind of stuff?

169
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:46,172
You know, she does

170
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:48,141
Hold on to this one.
I intend to.

171
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:50,977
Uh, espresso, please.

172
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:55,348
You know, every day I learn something new about her.

173
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:58,651
She enjoys reading
poetry in the bath

174
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:01,320
She's an excellent cook.

175
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,656
It's like she's
the perfect girl for me.

176
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:05,925
Well, I think you make
a lovely couple.

177
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:08,661
Even though Niles can't believe you're dating a gym teacher.

178
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:10,630
He says it's a betrayal
of your younger selves.

179
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,565
It's perfectly understandable

180
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:15,568
We didn't have much luck with gym
teachers when we were kids.

181
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:18,070
They were always
so derisive and
ego-crippling.

182
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:21,574
There was this one
 in particular, Coach Fuller..

183
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:23,576
he was the worst.

184
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:26,078
The kind of man that would make the whole class wait

185
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:27,947
while you did your push-up

186
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,849
It was just so traumatizing,

187
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:33,219
I would actually lose my
lunch before gym period.

188
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:35,588
Except on those days when my lunch money was stolen.

189
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:37,356
Then I'd just dry heave.

190
00:07:37,356 --> 00:07:40,693
Niles has tons
of stories like that.

191
00:07:40,693 --> 00:07:42,028
You know...

192
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:43,396
perhaps getting to know Chelsea

193
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:46,866
will help Niles to exorcise his
demons and put them behind him.

194
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:49,836
He's running out of room
back there.

195
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:50,837
Hey, Roz.
Hey, Daphne.

196
00:07:51,337 --> 00:07:52,205
Hey, Frasier.
Hi, Roz.

197
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:53,706
You all right?

198
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:56,209
I was fine until I saw
Julia in the parking lot.

199
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:57,710
Why does she have to come here?

200
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:59,212
For God's sakes, Roz.

201
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:02,215
I'm a little tired
of hearing you complain
about Julia all the time.

202
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:04,217
Why don't you just
give her a chance?

203
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:05,182
How about her?

204
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:09,388
and she shows me no respect.

205
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:12,391
She's mean and arrogant, but not in a funny way, like you.

206
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:14,861
Could I have
a latte, please?

207
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:16,362
The woman took
a portion of my show

208
00:08:16,362 --> 00:08:17,363
to do her financial drivel.

209
00:08:17,363 --> 00:08:19,632
You don't hear me complaining
about it all the time.

210
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:20,399
Now enough is enough.

211
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:21,901
Julia...

212
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:23,903
why don't you
come and join us?

213
00:08:23,903 --> 00:08:25,905
Oh, all right.

214
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:28,908
Thank you.

215
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:31,911
Hello, Frasier.

216
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:36,849
Well, isn't this nice?

217
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,251
All right,
it's come to my attention

218
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:41,120
that there is some tension
between the two of you.

219
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,421
Now, as it is
entirely possible

220
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:43,356
that we will be spending

221
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:44,824
a great deal of time together,

222
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:46,325
I think it's important
that we establish

223
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:48,628
an environment
of mutual respect.

224
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:49,428
To that end,

225
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:51,430
as it is impossible
for the two of you

226
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:52,932
to communicate at all,

227
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:57,770
it's time for me to roll up
my sleeves and facilitate.

228
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:00,773
Finding some common ground
would be the first step.

229
00:09:00,773 --> 00:09:04,210
Perhaps a love of plants,
the seed...

230
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,112
You sure love to hear
yourself talk.

231
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:08,047
And it's impossible to tune him out.

232
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:09,282
How can you stand it?

233
00:09:09,515 --> 00:09:11,584
The key is to know
when to say "uh-huh."

234
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:12,952
FRASIER:
Fine, fine,
all right.

235
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:16,289
If I am your common ground,
so be it.

236
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:17,723
Please feel free
to tread upon me.

237
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:19,125
Uh-huh.

238
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:20,626
The important thing is
that you're talking.

239
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:21,961
Communication...

240
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:23,296
Just go.

241
00:09:29,368 --> 00:09:30,803
Okay, he's gone.

242
00:09:44,817 --> 00:09:47,753
CHELSEA:
Slowly.

243
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:49,155
Oh.

244
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:50,489
Be with you
in a minute.

245
00:09:50,489 --> 00:09:52,258
You can wait in my office.

246
00:09:57,263 --> 00:10:00,333
(claps):
Very nice. Nice.

247
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:02,702
All right,
concentrate.

248
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:07,707
There we go!
Good!

249
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:10,643
"Please excuse my daughter Ruby
from PE."

250
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:11,644
CHELSEA:
Concentrate!

251
00:10:12,144 --> 00:10:16,148
"She has a 'delibitating' disease."

252
00:10:16,148 --> 00:10:17,416
Nice try, Ruby.

253
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:18,184
(whistle blows)

254
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:21,187
Okay, who didn't climb rope yet?

255
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:23,189
Campbell, you're up.

256
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:35,534
Oh, I'd forgotten how it felt

257
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:36,902
to sneak a kiss in school.

258
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:38,671
It always
looked like fun.

259
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:40,539
So I'll be finished here in a second

260
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,475
and then we can go.
Great, great.

261
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:43,876
I thought we'd try
this new place I just...

262
00:10:43,876 --> 00:10:44,877
(blows)

263
00:10:44,877 --> 00:10:46,812
Campbell, you're not even trying.

264
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:48,214
(sighs)

265
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:49,548
Sorry. You were saying?

266
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:51,550
Yeah, I read a great review
of this new restaurant.

267
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:53,052
Apparently
the chef is from...

268
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:55,054
(bell rings, whistle blows)

269
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:58,491
No one is leaving
until Campbell climbs the rope!

270
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:02,061
(

271
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:03,562
Come on!

272
00:11:03,562 --> 00:11:05,364
You can sleep
through English.

273
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:07,700
Toughen up,
you can do it.

274
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,602
Let's go, Campbell!

275
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:11,537
Everybody's waiting.

276
00:11:11,537 --> 00:11:13,873
COACH FULLER:
Come on, Crane!

277
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:16,075
Nobody is going home

278
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:18,911
until you haul that fat bucket of lard
to the top.

279
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,379
(cries):
I can't.

280
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:22,882
I can't.

281
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:30,189
Just give me a few minutes
and I'll be ready to go.

282
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:32,091
Oh, I just need you to do one thing.

283
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:34,460
Drop and give me 20, Crane.

284
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:38,364
I beg your pardon?

285
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:39,765
Could you just round up
the basketballs

286
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:41,600
and put them in the rack
over there?

287
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,869
Thanks

288
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:46,172
(whistle blows)

289
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,523
Frasier, Niles has
something

290
00:12:04,523 --> 00:12:06,525
he needs to tell you.

291
00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:10,529
Go on, tell him.

292
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:12,031
I'm sick of hearing
you complain.

293
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:17,369
I made a mistake
partnering with Jim.

294
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:20,372
Our styles never really meshed,
which wasn't my fault,

295
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:22,374
but that didn't stop him

296
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:24,376
from losing his temper
during a match,

297
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:25,745
and he yelled at me.

298
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:28,481
With you,
it was different.

299
00:12:28,814 --> 00:12:30,382
You brought honor to the game.

300
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:31,884
Rejoin me, Frasier,

301
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:34,653
and together we can rekindle
the magic.

302
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:38,023
Please take him back.

303
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:40,493
I cannot listen to another draft
of this speech.

304
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,428
I'll see you
at home, sweetie.

305
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:43,429
Thanks, hon.

306
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,433
Niles, I'll gladly re-team with you

307
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:49,068
Just like that?

308
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:53,639
I expected you to gloat
and rub it in, make me suffer.

309
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,107
Don't you care?

310
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:56,575
Oh, my apologies, Niles.

311
00:12:57,076 --> 00:12:59,578
It's just that I'm a little distracted about something

312
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:01,413
that happened yesterday
at Chelsea's school.

313
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:02,782
I'm sorry,
but that reminds me--

314
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:03,783
Chelsea sent me
the sweetest gift

315
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,751
after Jim and I were
eliminated from
the tournament.

316
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:08,754
It's an actual squash
with a smiley face drawn on it.

317
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:10,256
That's cute.

318
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:11,757
You know, when you
first started dating her,

319
00:13:11,757 --> 00:13:14,260
I couldn't get past the fact that she was a gym teacher.

320
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,262
But she's proven to be
nothing like I expected.

321
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:17,229
Kudos to you.

322
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:19,532
Well, not sure I deserve
such praise.

323
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:20,933
No, no, don't be so modest, Frasier.

324
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:22,434
You truly have a gift

325
00:13:22,434 --> 00:13:24,236
for seeing the inner beauty
in a person.

326
00:13:24,236 --> 00:13:25,437
I do try.

327
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:26,772
Speak of the devil.

328
00:13:26,772 --> 00:13:28,174
Here's Dad
and Chelsea now.

329
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:29,608
MARTIN:
Hey, guys.

330
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:30,976
Look who I ran into.

331
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:32,812
NILES:
Hello, Dad.

332
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:33,846
Hi, Chelsea.

333
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:35,848
Niles.

334
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:37,783
Hello, sweetie.

335
00:13:37,783 --> 00:13:40,853
NILES:
That's a lovely
outfit.

336
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:42,254
Really?

337
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:45,558
You think so, huh?

338
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:47,459
I thought it might be
a little racy,

339
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,461
but then I thought,
what the hell.

340
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:51,964
What do you think, Frasier?

341
00:13:51,964 --> 00:13:53,966
Oh, it's very.
.. very becoming.

342
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,367
CHELSEA:
Thank you.

343
00:13:55,734 --> 00:13:58,804
Just let me grab a drink
and we'll be ready to go.

344
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:01,307
I usually stay out
of your love affairs, son,

345
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:02,808
but you've got
a good one here.

346
00:14:02,808 --> 00:14:03,742
Definitely a keeper.

347
00:14:03,742 --> 00:14:05,144
Yes, and might I add--

348
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:06,979
and excuse my gutter speak--
hubba, hubba.

349
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,481
Back to our best behavior.

350
00:14:09,481 --> 00:14:10,983
There's a lady present.

351
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:12,952
ie.
I'm ready, sweet

352
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:32,037
"Love is a smoke raised
from the fume of sighs,

353
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:37,543
being purged, a fire
sparkling in lovers' eyes..."

354
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,011
You all right?

355
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:40,546
What?

356
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,047
I'm fine.

357
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:43,515
CHELSEA:
All right, good.

358
00:14:43,515 --> 00:14:45,451
"I am a vessel,

359
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:48,420
"come tenderly
and fill me

360
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:52,424
with the nectar
of your love."

361
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:55,427
So I figure since
you're the financial guru,

362
00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:56,896
you could help me out.

363
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,365
Now obviously, I don't want to get involved in

364
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:00,866
some get-rich-quick scheme,

365
00:15:00,866 --> 00:15:03,869
but I do need to make
a lot of money really fast.

366
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:04,837
So what do you got?

367
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:06,705
I don't like to talk about work

368
00:15:06,705 --> 00:15:08,207
when I'm outside the office.

369
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:09,742
Oh.

370
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:10,743
Thank you.

371
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:13,145
Right.
Me neither

372
00:15:14,546 --> 00:15:17,383
Hey, there's Roz.

373
00:15:17,783 --> 00:15:18,350
Hey, Roz, come join us.

374
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:19,852
I don't think so.

375
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:21,353
No, no, no, I won't take no for an answer.

376
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:24,356
Now you sit down.

377
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:25,858
Hi, Julia.

378
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:27,359
Roz.

379
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:29,862
Well, I know girl talk
when I hear it. Bye.

380
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:34,867
I'll go this time.

381
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:36,368
Thanks.

382
00:15:38,837 --> 00:15:40,906
You know, maybe Frasier
was right.

383
00:15:40,906 --> 00:15:43,842
Would it kill us
to make some effort to be civil?

384
00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:46,078
I guess not.

385
00:15:48,914 --> 00:15:50,416
Thanks

386
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,184
So

387
00:15:52,384 --> 00:15:54,853
Your show was good today.

388
00:15:55,187 --> 00:15:57,589
Yes, it was.

389
00:15:57,856 --> 00:15:59,291
And...

390
00:15:59,591 --> 00:16:03,429
and your producing
was top-notch.

391
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:05,331
Thanks

392
00:16:05,831 --> 00:16:06,832
Sugar?

393
00:16:06,832 --> 00:16:10,169
Please.

394
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:11,503
Well, this isn't so bad.

395
00:16:11,503 --> 00:16:12,404
No, it's not.

396
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:15,207
Maybe we just got off
on the wrong foot.

397
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:16,575
Well, when you first started,

398
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:18,577
I just thought you were
kind of a bitch

399
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:19,979
for ordering everyone around.

400
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,414
That's totally my fault.

401
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:26,185
I have a tendency
to be patronizing

402
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:29,788
to entry-level
employees.

403
00:16:29,788 --> 00:16:32,124
Well, you know, I was going to say something earlier,

404
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:34,560
but when I heard
your first show,

405
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,930
I figured you wouldn't
be here long.

406
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:41,300
Well, you certainly made
an impression on me.

407
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,801
I remember, I kept thinking,

408
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:45,304
"Who did she sleep with
to get this job?"

409
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:46,305
And then I found out.

410
00:16:46,805 --> 00:16:48,307
Everybody.

411
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,543
That's a good one.

412
00:16:51,543 --> 00:16:53,345
(chuckling)

413
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:55,180
You know, there's
a plunger in the bathroom.

414
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,182
What do you say we go look
for your career?

415
00:16:58,584 --> 00:16:59,985
Great.

416
00:16:59,985 --> 00:17:02,388
While we're in there,
I can get your phone number.

417
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:05,824
Don't bother.

418
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:08,260
It's 1-800-BITE ME.

419
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,429
Bite me?
That's the best that you've got?

420
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:12,197
Oh, I could spend half an hour
on your hair.

421
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:14,666
Well, you should have spent
a half an hour on your hair.

422
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:16,168
Oh, really?

423
00:17:16,168 --> 00:17:17,669
It's closing time,
ladies.

424
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:19,171
I'm afraid
you'll have to leave.

425
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:21,173
But we're
just warming up.

426
00:17:21,673 --> 00:17:23,675
You know, there's
a place down the street

427
00:17:23,675 --> 00:17:24,676
that is open all night.

428
00:17:24,676 --> 00:17:26,678
Just like your mouth?

429
00:17:26,678 --> 00:17:29,181
Just like your legs.

430
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:32,184
Hey, wait up.

431
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:44,696
So, we're just going to go to sleep, huh?

432
00:17:49,701 --> 00:17:52,204
I'm really tired.

433
00:17:52,704 --> 00:17:54,206
You sure you don't want to watch TV

434
00:17:54,706 --> 00:17:55,707
or get something to eat?

435
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:57,142
No.

436
00:17:57,142 --> 00:18:00,112
I know someone
who's ticklish.

437
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:03,115
No, stop, stop, stop!

438
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:11,123
Okay, Frasier, you've been acting weird all day.

439
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:13,058
What's going on?

440
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:16,061
Well, it's a little
complicated.

441
00:18:16,061 --> 00:18:17,062
What is?

442
00:18:17,062 --> 00:18:19,565
Is there a problem?

443
00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:28,173
Yes, Chelsea, there is.

444
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:29,641
It disturbed me yesterday

445
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:33,145
when I saw you yelling at
that little girl on the rope.

446
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:35,647
I couldn't believe
how harsh you were.

447
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:38,150
And you may not realize it,

448
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:40,119
but that can have
a crippling effect on a child.

449
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:43,055
What?!

450
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:46,058
I didn't think I was being excessively harsh.

451
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:48,927
I was just trying
to motivate her.

452
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:51,296
Yes, well, the way
you were shouting,

453
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:52,297
it was hard to tell.

454
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,800
And when you're a child,
all you know is

455
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,268
you're being singled out

456
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:01,740
I have no right to tell you
how to do your job.

457
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,576
It's, uh... it's my problem, not yours.

458
00:19:04,576 --> 00:19:06,411
No, no.

459
00:19:06,411 --> 00:19:08,714
You may have a point.

460
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:14,686
Maybe... I do push too hard.

461
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:17,689
Sometimes I forget

462
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:21,627
just how fragile kids can be.

463
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:23,095
Really?

464
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:24,897
You agree with me?

465
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:26,665
Yes, I do.

466
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,634
Thank you, Frasier

467
00:19:37,075 --> 00:19:40,479
It's sweet of you to care so much.

468
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:43,849
Well, you're worth
caring about.

469
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:47,719
Now, come on.

470
00:19:48,153 --> 00:19:52,191
Let's go have a nice,
romantic dinner.

471
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,159
Okay, all right.

472
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:56,161
Let me just
go get ready.

473
00:19:56,662 --> 00:19:57,663
You know,
when I heard you shouting

474
00:19:58,163 --> 00:19:59,164
at that little girl today,

475
00:19:59,164 --> 00:20:01,166
I swear, it just brought back
a flood of memories

476
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:02,501
from my own childhood.

477
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:03,802
Really?
Oh, yeah.

478
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:05,237
You know,
my gym teacher

479
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:07,172
was constantly yelling at me

480
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:09,174
because I couldn't do
a single pull-up

481
00:20:09,174 --> 00:20:10,442
or a lap

482
00:20:10,442 --> 00:20:12,711
around the track.

483
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,713
Not even one?

484
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:16,982
Oh, please.

485
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:18,750
I was a
very late bloomer.

486
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,686
I could barely do
a jumping jack

487
00:20:20,686 --> 00:20:22,254
without getting
a nosebleed.

488
00:20:22,254 --> 00:20:24,756
And let's not begin
to talk about

489
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:26,258
the climbing rope.

490
00:20:26,758 --> 00:20:28,694
There we go,
all done.

491
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:34,600
Well...

492
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:41,873
What do you say I get us
a table at Petite Auberge?

493
00:20:41,873 --> 00:20:44,743
They do an excellent veal chop.

494
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:47,012
Okay.

495
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:48,847
