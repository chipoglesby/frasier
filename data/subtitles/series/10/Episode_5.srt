1
00:00:10,577 --> 00:00:12,412
(nervous breathing)

2
00:00:12,645 --> 00:00:14,614
Sorry.

3
00:00:14,914 --> 00:00:17,484
I'm a... nervous flyer.

4
00:00:17,917 --> 00:00:19,486
Yes, I see.

5
00:00:19,986 --> 00:00:22,489
Oh, you're white as a sheet.

6
00:00:22,489 --> 00:00:26,326
Actually,
I'm always this pale.

7
00:00:26,593 --> 00:00:28,595
My ex-wife used to say
she could tell

8
00:00:29,162 --> 00:00:32,032
when I was embarrassed
because I'd turn off-white
.

9
00:00:32,465 --> 00:00:33,533
I can empathize.

10
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:35,468
Sometimes after a late night,

11
00:00:35,468 --> 00:00:38,872
I've covered my undereye circles with Liquid Paper.

12
00:00:39,272 --> 00:00:40,840
(chuckles)

13
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:42,809
So, are you traveling to Seattle

14
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:43,810
for business
or pleasure?

15
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:45,311
Both, hopefully.

16
00:00:45,311 --> 00:00:46,579
I'm relocating for work.

17
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,348
How about you?

18
00:00:48,348 --> 00:00:50,750
I need to ask an old friend
for a favor.

19
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:54,087
Hmm. It's a long trip
just to ask for a favor.

20
00:00:54,454 --> 00:00:56,823
It's a big favor.

21
00:00:57,023 --> 00:00:59,092
Well, I hope
your friend complies.

22
00:00:59,492 --> 00:01:01,961
It'll take some work,
but I'll get what I want
.

23
00:01:02,295 --> 00:01:03,363
Oh, dear.

24
00:01:03,363 --> 00:01:07,200
You two look
awfully pale.

25
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,835
Can I bring you something?

26
00:01:09,102 --> 00:01:10,170
Not unless you have

27
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,671
any extra melanin lying around.

28
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:12,605
(laughs)

29
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:15,975
You should be a comedian.

30
00:01:16,342 --> 00:01:17,377
I've thought about it.

31
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:25,351
(door opening)

32
00:01:25,785 --> 00:01:28,354
Dad? Dad, Dad, what,
are you hiding?

33
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:34,027
I heard the key in the door.

34
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:35,361
I thought Lilith
might be with you.

35
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:38,798
What's she coming for, anyway?

36
00:01:39,165 --> 00:01:40,200
Well, I don't really know.

37
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,702
She... she said she was flying
across the country

38
00:01:42,702 --> 00:01:44,704
to ask me about something
that was important.

39
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:46,172
She's being very mysterious
about it.

40
00:01:46,172 --> 00:01:47,173
Hmm.
(doorbell rings)

41
00:01:47,674 --> 00:01:48,675
Is that her?

42
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:49,676
Well, no. No, Dad.

43
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:51,177
I'm not seeing her
until tomorrow.

44
00:01:51,177 --> 00:01:52,679
Well, let me know
when she's coming, will you,

45
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:54,180
so I can come up with an excuse
to clear out

46
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,482
because I'm not good
at winging it.

47
00:01:56,716 --> 00:01:58,751
Oh... Lilith.

48
00:01:58,751 --> 00:02:00,019
.
(chuckles)
: Hi... uh..

49
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,255
Look who's here, Dad.

50
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:03,556
Hello, Martin.

51
00:02:05,391 --> 00:02:09,729
Oh! Time to go
practice my signature.

52
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:11,030
.
Please, come on in, Lilith

53
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:14,033
Uh, so, uh, I didn't think I was going to be seeing you

54
00:02:14,033 --> 00:02:15,535
until tomorrow

55
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:18,037
Yes, I know that was the plan,
but I just had to stop by

56
00:02:18,037 --> 00:02:19,038
on my way to the hotel.

57
00:02:19,038 --> 00:02:21,040
What I'm here
to talk to you about

58
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,443
is not something one just
drops on another person.

59
00:02:23,843 --> 00:02:25,912
Please.

60
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,415
(sighs):
Frasier.

61
00:02:29,415 --> 00:02:30,416
(clears throat)

62
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:31,417
Recently,

63
00:02:31,417 --> 00:02:32,919
a subconscious yearning

64
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:35,922
has tunneled its way
to the surface

65
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:38,424
and I now know
what it is I need

66
00:02:38,424 --> 00:02:41,194
in order to make my life complete.

67
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:42,929
Well, that's wonderful news.

68
00:02:42,929 --> 00:02:44,264
How can I help?

69
00:02:44,597 --> 00:02:47,167
You can give me your sperm

70
00:02:54,607 --> 00:02:56,509
I beg your pardon?

71
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:59,379
I want to have another baby.

72
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:01,314
Well, you certainly
don't need me for that.

73
00:03:01,814 --> 00:03:06,719
Surely, someone in Boston
must have sperm.

74
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:08,121
I came to you first

75
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:10,056
so that Frederick could have a full sibling.

76
00:03:10,056 --> 00:03:11,491
So, just like that,

77
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:13,493
we're going to have
another baby together?

78
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:15,061
.
No, no, no, not just like that

79
00:03:15,061 --> 00:03:18,131
I mapped out our dominant and recessive traits

80
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:20,633
on a genome square,
applied Mendel's laws,

81
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:22,635
allowed for anomalies, and concluded

82
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:25,405
that you are the best biological choice.

83
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,641
I see.

84
00:03:28,641 --> 00:03:33,680
Well, as enticed as I am
by your honeyed words...

85
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,616
I'm going to need some kissin'

86
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:40,053
Frasier, don't misunderstand

87
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:43,356
I'm not proposing
any change in our relationship.

88
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,525
Would we sleep together?

89
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:49,329
I thought we'd freeze
your sperm.

90
00:03:49,762 --> 00:03:52,832
Is that a yes or a no?

91
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:01,040
Natural fertilization
isn't practical.

92
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,476
I'd have to fly to Seattle every time I ovulate.

93
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:06,879
Right, okay,
so then your plan is

94
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,782
for me to visit
some local doctor,

95
00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:13,086
uh, freeze my essence
and then bring it home with you.

96
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:13,987
Correct.

97
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:16,856
I'll take mine to go.

98
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:19,726
I...
I don't know.

99
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:22,095
I'm going to have
to think about it.

100
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,363
Yes, of course, absolutely.

101
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:26,366
Think about it, and you can
give me your answer tomorrow.

102
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:27,867
Ok

103
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:31,738
You can come back from
around the corner now, Martin.

104
00:04:31,971 --> 00:04:33,806
MARTIN:
Good night, Lilith.

105
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:35,475
Good night.

106
00:04:39,178 --> 00:04:40,947
You were eavesdropping?

107
00:04:41,147 --> 00:04:42,715
It was an accident,
and I only heard the part

108
00:04:42,715 --> 00:04:44,550
about her wanting to have
another baby with you.

109
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:47,453
She completely threw me.

110
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,455
Well, I don't know why you're so surprised.

111
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,391
She's seen what
the Crane genes can do

112
00:04:51,724 --> 00:04:56,129
and she's coming back
to the well.

113
00:04:56,362 --> 00:04:59,399
How does one respond
to something like that?

114
00:04:59,832 --> 00:05:02,168
Well, I bet if you say no,
she'll go to Niles.

115
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:03,403
Really, it's just
so self-centered of her.

116
00:05:03,903 --> 00:05:05,405
You know, she's got this
all figured out for herself

117
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:07,340
without the slightest
consideration for my life.

118
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:10,643
And Niles will
say no for sure.

119
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:15,081
Which means only one thing:

120
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:18,084
she'll come to the source.

121
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:20,586
Me.

122
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:23,556
The fountainhead.

123
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:24,490
What?

124
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:25,992
Can you imagine?

125
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:28,061
Lilith's and my kid
would be brothers

126
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:30,430
to you and Niles and Freddy.

127
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:33,166
What are you talking about?

128
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,601
And if you and Lilith
got back together,

129
00:05:35,601 --> 00:05:38,104
you'd be his stepfather
and his brother,

130
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:42,942
and Niles would be your son...
and his own uncle.

131
00:05:45,745 --> 00:05:49,749
It's almost worth doing just so that I can tell the story.

132
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,688
Oh, hi, Niles.

133
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:57,190
Did Daphne and her mum
get off okay?

134
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,459
Uh, yes, they picked up
Roz and Alice an hour ago.

135
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:01,761
Although how they're going to get all the way to Canada

136
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:03,129
without killing each other,
I don't know.

137
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:04,597
Why did they have
to go so far?

138
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:05,965
Well, that was my idea.

139
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:07,367
I read that
Canadian Fun Country's

140
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:08,868
one of the best amusement parks

141
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,370
in southeastern
British Columbia.

142
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,304
Oh.

143
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:12,705
Well, I'm just saying

144
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:14,207
Daphne's mum should be careful, you know.

145
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,208
If you're here
on a temporary visa,

146
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:16,676
sometimes people have
a difficult time

147
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:18,010
getting back into the country.

148
00:06:18,244 --> 00:06:20,313
That hadn't occurred to me, Frasier.

149
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:21,681
(clears throat)

150
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:23,049
Well, seeing as howyou're single,

151
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,550
I'd invite you
to join me for dinner,

152
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,985
but I'm-I'm meeting
with Lilith tonight

153
00:06:25,985 --> 00:06:28,187
on a matter of some delicacy.

154
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:29,489
Uh, Dad told me.

155
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:31,991
Now listen,
don't feel obligated

156
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:34,827
because she's buying you dinner.

157
00:06:34,827 --> 00:06:38,731
Truth be told, Niles,
I haven't ruled it out entirely.

158
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:41,534
It would be nice
to have another child,

159
00:06:41,934 --> 00:06:45,004
and Lilith is
a wonderful mother.

160
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:47,006
It's just that, well...

161
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:49,509
is it right to create
a human being with a woman

162
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:51,878
to whom you couldn't stand being married?

163
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:54,747
Well, I'm behind you,
whatever decision you make--

164
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:56,249
the right one or the crazy one.

165
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,250
Well, thank you.

166
00:06:57,683 --> 00:06:58,684
(both chuckling)

167
00:06:58,684 --> 00:07:00,720
Excuse me.
May I have an
espresso, please?

168
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,288
And what have you
got here?

169
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:04,357
Oh, some snapshots
from last summer at the beach.

170
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:05,691
Daphne finally got them
developed.

171
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:07,193
(laughing):
Oh, look.

172
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:10,196
There's Dad eating that hot dog
he dropped in the sand.

173
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:11,631
Yes.

174
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:14,700
And you in your
linen beach ensemble.

175
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:16,068
Very nice, yes

176
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:17,370
Well, that's strange.

177
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:18,871
Daphne said
I'd particularly like

178
00:07:19,405 --> 00:07:21,441
the last picture on the roll,
but what is it?

179
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:23,910
Well, it's hard to tell.

180
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:25,912
It's too dark and blurry.

181
00:07:26,345 --> 00:07:28,047
Looks like the eye of Jupiter.

182
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:29,582
Or a slice of pepperoni.

183
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:31,818
Is it a flying saucer?

184
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:33,886
Yes, Niles,
it's a flying saucer.

185
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:35,788
Mystery solved.
Well done.

186
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:36,789
Thanks

187
00:07:37,256 --> 00:07:39,292
Hey, where'd you get
the nipple shot?

188
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:44,797
Good Lord!

189
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:48,334
You are to erase that
from your mind!

190
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:49,535
Well, is it Daphne?

191
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:50,403
Nice.

192
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:51,904
You're not erasing!

193
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:52,905
Erase!

194
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:57,910
I need to stop again.

195
00:07:57,910 --> 00:07:58,911
We just stopped.

196
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:00,813
I told you not to get that Big Gulp.

197
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:04,817
Punchb

198
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,185
Ow! Dammit!

199
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:06,986
Language.

200
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,821
Why does she keep doing that?

201
00:08:09,188 --> 00:08:10,089
It's a game.

202
00:08:10,356 --> 00:08:11,691
It hurts.

203
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:13,226
All right, Mum.

204
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:14,794
There's a gas station
right there.

205
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:15,795
I really need to stop.

206
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:17,630
I can't get over.
You'll have to wait.

207
00:08:17,897 --> 00:08:19,465
But according to this,

208
00:08:19,465 --> 00:08:22,735
my bladder is holding
"thirsty"-two ounces of soda.

209
00:08:22,935 --> 00:08:24,403
It's only 40 miles.

210
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:26,072
Punchbuggy red.

211
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:27,240
Oh, son of a...!

212
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:28,608
Language.

213
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:29,675
Alice, honey,

214
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:31,978
stop hitting Mrs. Moon.

215
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,080
She can't take
the punchbuggy game.

216
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,949
Oh, really?

217
00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:37,783
Punchbuggy white.

218
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,585
Ow! That was a Jeep.

219
00:08:39,585 --> 00:08:41,587
I like playing with Jeeps.

220
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:42,588
And Fords.

221
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:43,856
Punchbuggy Ford.

222
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:46,659
All right, that's enough!

223
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:50,563
You stop it, or no one's going to Canadian Fun Country.

224
00:08:50,963 --> 00:08:53,032
And this time I mean it.

225
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,000
(screams)

226
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,468
(others scream)

227
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:59,438
I'm sorry. I thought you were
on the wrong side of the road.

228
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:01,440
I will never get used
to the crazy way

229
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:02,909
you drive over here.

230
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:05,344
Mum, you have to stop
doing that.

231
00:09:05,344 --> 00:09:07,313
Daphne, you seem stressed.

232
00:09:07,813 --> 00:09:10,583
Do you want me to drive
for a while?

233
00:09:10,783 --> 00:09:12,852
Maybe once we get out
of Seattle.

234
00:09:16,822 --> 00:09:19,325
Frasier, I don't want to rush you,

235
00:09:19,825 --> 00:09:22,261
but the suspense
is too much to bear.

236
00:09:22,628 --> 00:09:24,130
Have you decided?

237
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:27,833
I'm thinking
about the linguini.

238
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:30,369
I see.

239
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:32,238
It's "no" then, isn't it?

240
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,441
I'm sorry, Lilith.

241
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:38,110
This was a very difficult
decision for me,

242
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:40,880
and I am touched and flattered
that you came to me,

243
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:44,383
but I'm not sure I'd be doing it for the right reasons.

244
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:45,685
You understand, don't you?

245
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:46,986
Yes, I do.

246
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:49,322
And I appreciate your taking
the time to think about it.

247
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:50,623
Well...

248
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:52,592
It's that kind of consideration

249
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,560
I was hoping to pass on
to our second-born.

250
00:09:56,996 --> 00:09:58,931
Oh, well.

251
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:01,367
So, the pasta's good here?

252
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:02,368
Oh, the best.

253
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:07,807
♪♪
(tune of "Ode To Joy"):
♪♪ My dad is the gweatest dad

254
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:09,709
♪♪
♪♪ Because he cooks
me cweam of wheat...

255
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:11,110
Lilith, what are you singing?

256
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,945
Was I singing?

257
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:16,215
You were singing
"My Dad is the Gweatest Dad."

258
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:17,783
Oh, you mean that song
Frederick wrote for you

259
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:18,784
when he was four?

260
00:10:19,218 --> 00:10:21,787
That video is one of
my prize possessions.

261
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:24,590
Of course I haven't
looked at it in some time.

262
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:27,393
I remember the night
we surprised you with it.

263
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:29,895
He crawled up in
your lap and said,

264
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:31,330
"Why is Daddy cwying?"

265
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:33,766
I see what you're doing,
you know.

266
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:34,767
What?

267
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:35,768
You are attempting
to manipulate me

268
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:37,670
by invoking powerful,
emotional memories.

269
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:41,340
I assure you, nothing could be
further from the truth.

270
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:42,642
Are you ready to order?

271
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:43,509
Yes.

272
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:45,745
I'd like the bisketti
with beatmalls.

273
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:47,546
Mmm, very
good, miss

274
00:10:47,913 --> 00:10:49,982
That's what our son used to say when he was three.

275
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,284
Excellent!

276
00:10:52,284 --> 00:10:54,353
And I'll have the veal.

277
00:10:54,553 --> 00:10:57,123
Bravo, sir.

278
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:58,591
Lilith,

279
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:01,594
.
I'm afraid
you're idealizing parenthood

280
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:05,498
Do you remember colic? Teething?
Changing mountains of diapers?

281
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:07,433
Do you remember that
time in the bath

282
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:08,834
when he tried to
eat the bubbles?

283
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:10,603
We told him to stop,

284
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:11,937
but we kept laughing,

285
00:11:11,937 --> 00:11:14,740
so he thought it was
funny and kept doing it.

286
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,509
You know, I'd forgotten
about that.

287
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,010
Oh, I wish we had that on video.

288
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:19,512
You can, Frasier.

289
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:20,513
We can have those days back again.

290
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,481
Please

291
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:25,484
I just need a couple
of teaspoons.

292
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:27,253
Lilith!

293
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:29,021
Just think about what Frederick has meant

294
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:29,955
in our lives.

295
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:31,357
I think about it every day.

296
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:32,792
Frasier...

297
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:35,861
we're always seeking ways we can leave a legacy.

298
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:38,864
Well, forget my research
and your work.

299
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:40,299
This is it.

300
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:43,002
What better gift can
we bestow on the world

301
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:46,706
but another person as
wonderful as Frederick?

302
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:49,842
Excuse me,

303
00:11:49,842 --> 00:11:52,978
um... I've changed my mind.

304
00:11:52,978 --> 00:11:54,780
,
I've decided that I, too

305
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,716
will have
the bisketti and beatmalls.

306
00:12:03,656 --> 00:12:05,658
Thank you.

307
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:07,159
Gosh, that coffee smells so good

308
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:08,394
Mmm.

309
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:09,729
Lilith won't let me have
any caffeine

310
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,163
until I've made
my little donation.

311
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:13,399
Ah, yes.

312
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:14,667
So, have you heard from Daphne?

313
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:17,503
No, we keep
missing each other.

314
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:20,940
I'm just glad I have
our little pictorial memento

315
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,408
to keep me company.

316
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:23,876
I can't believe you're so taken

317
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:25,344
with that blurry
overexposed photo of a...

318
00:12:25,711 --> 00:12:27,079
Shh.

319
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:32,384
Of what you first mistook
to be a flying saucer.

320
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:35,721
I just think it's sexy
that she even did it.

321
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:36,655
Yeah.

322
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:38,157
Imagine it-- she saw

323
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:39,458
there was one picture
left on the roll.

324
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:43,262
In a spontaneous moment
of brazen exhibitionism,

325
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,263
she threw open her blouse

326
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,766
and just didn't even bother
to adjust the f-stop.

327
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,267
(chuckles)

328
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:51,137
Yes, indeed. Oh.

329
00:12:51,403 --> 00:12:55,841
I am married
to one spicy meatball.

330
00:12:55,841 --> 00:12:57,176
Good Lord.

331
00:12:57,176 --> 00:12:59,578
Don't tell me you carry
it around with you.

332
00:13:00,012 --> 00:13:01,080
Well...

333
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,082
I didn't want
the housekeeper to find it

334
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:05,384
and think we were
pornographers.

335
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:13,159
WOMAN:
Just fill out these forms

336
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:15,127
and I can show you to
one of our donation suites

337
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:16,128
Thank you.

338
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,871
Will this be your first?

339
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:28,307
No, I've been doing this
since I was 12.

340
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:38,984
You mean baby.

341
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:41,420
Uh, no, no.
This is our second

342
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,689
We've got number four
on the way.

343
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:44,957
Oh, and we're
thrilled for you,

344
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:46,959
but perhaps we can chat
some other time

345
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,961
when we're not trying
to create life.

346
00:13:48,961 --> 00:13:50,796
Sign and date.
Right.

347
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,168
This process can be hard
on a relationship,

348
00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:58,637
but she'll relax
and things will get better.

349
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:00,573
We're already divorced.

350
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:02,575
Good, 'cause she'll
never change.

351
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:05,678
Up and at 'em.

352
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:07,012
Follow me, sir.

353
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,852
Just go ahead in and make
yourself comfortable.

354
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,353
You'll find everything
you need in the cabinet.

355
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:15,621
Thank you.

356
00:14:16,922 --> 00:14:18,691
Uh, wait, Frasier.

357
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:20,559
It probably doesn't matter, but...

358
00:14:21,093 --> 00:14:23,495
try to think
positive thoughts.

359
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:25,898
Thanks for that.

360
00:14:25,898 --> 00:14:27,399
I was going to think

361
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:30,369
about the plight
of the American Indian.

362
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:35,674
I'm just saying we should put the welfare of the sample first.

363
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,076
Mm-hmm.

364
00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:43,215
Yes?

365
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,718
And don't fall asleep
afterwards.

366
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:48,721
I want to get
these puppies on ice ASAP.

367
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:52,224
Good-bye now.

368
00:14:57,296 --> 00:14:58,797
Just a hint.

369
00:14:58,797 --> 00:14:59,798
Lilith!

370
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:03,802
If there is one thing I can
do by myself,this is it.

371
00:15:03,802 --> 00:15:06,305
Now, go away.

372
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,311
Right this way.

373
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,751
(phone ringing)

374
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:21,086
What?!

375
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:24,590
I just remembered
a special method

376
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,992
which supposedly
increases the likelihood

377
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:28,827
of having a boy.
I see.

378
00:15:29,194 --> 00:15:30,763
Is there something I can do
to increase the likelihood

379
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:34,133
that we won't have
a nettling control freak?

380
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:36,001
No, but perhaps you can use a method

381
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:38,504
which will give us a baby that
can take other people's advice.

382
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,005
I would settle for a method

383
00:15:40,005 --> 00:15:41,507
where it won't turn out
to be a sarcastic prig!

384
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:42,508
Oh, just do it

385
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:43,442
Fine.

386
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:45,010
No, wait.

387
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:46,278
I don't want you to do it when you're mad

388
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:47,579
Why don't we just.

389
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:49,448
take a minute and
sit down and breathe?

390
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:53,786
It's your dime.

391
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,667
Oh, dear God.

392
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,537
What if this child inherits
all of our flaws

393
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:13,038
instead of our strengths?

394
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:14,940
We could create
a real nightmare.

395
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:16,842
That's not going to happen.

396
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:18,844
It's going to
be exactly the way

397
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:20,479
it was the first time.

398
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:23,048
Is that what's going on

399
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:25,551
Are we trying to create a baby

400
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:28,554
or just trying
to recreate the past?

401
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:31,557
I mean, Frederick's
almost grown now.

402
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:34,360
It's only natural
to feel a sense of loss.

403
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,195
Frasier, don't be simplistic.

404
00:16:36,695 --> 00:16:38,697
Well, Lilith, I-I know
what you're going through.

405
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:40,699
You want to feel needed
and loved

406
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:43,102
as you were when you
were a new mother.

407
00:16:43,435 --> 00:16:45,504
The past can be very seductive.

408
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,006
I mean,
I've fallen into it, too

409
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,508
I'm trying to relive
Freddy's childhood, but.

410
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:56,515
You can't use the past to fill what's missing in the present.

411
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,350
It's gone.

412
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:03,222
Frasier, I've
done a lot of thinking

413
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:05,190
and this feels right to me

414
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:10,195
But it's not right for me.

415
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:11,530
I'm sorry.

416
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:16,368
I'm sorry, too.

417
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,046
You all right?

418
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,480
fine.
I'll be

419
00:17:28,847 --> 00:17:30,916
If I can't make another
little Frederick with you,

420
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:32,384
there's always cloning.

421
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:34,887
And you still don't know when I'm joking.

422
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,388
I... Well, I...

423
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:39,892
Lilith, what are you
going to do now?

424
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,393
Well, I'm going to go home

425
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:42,795
and give Frederick a very big hug.

426
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:45,731
And maybe swab the
inside of his cheek.

427
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:47,199
Oh, stop that.

428
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:53,205
Oh, you already ate.

429
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:55,674
I was going
to take you to Bogart's.

430
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:56,642
Bogart's?

431
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:59,078
Oh, don't worry about that

432
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,113
I was just eating it
because it was here.

433
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:02,581
I wasn't eating it to get full

434
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:03,582
Just give me two minutes.

435
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:05,584
(phone ringing)

436
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:08,620
Hello.

437
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,622
Oh, Niles, darling.

438
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:11,623
Daphne!

439
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:13,125
I thought I'd never reach you.

440
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:16,628
We were booted from the park and are coming home.

441
00:18:16,628 --> 00:18:19,965
It seems someone put out
 a cigarette on a stuffed moose.

442
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:22,267
I didn't know it was stuffed

443
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,603
I was defending myself.

444
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:26,905
I love those pictures
you left for me.

445
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:30,409
More specifically, the last one.

446
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:32,411
Something
a little different, eh?

447
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:33,412
Indeed, it is.

448
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:35,848
I can't even believe
you took it.

449
00:18:35,848 --> 00:18:37,249
I didn't take it.

450
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:38,183
Your father did.

451
00:18:38,183 --> 00:18:41,086
No, I don't think so.

452
00:18:41,086 --> 00:18:44,089
I'm talking about
the last picture on the roll.

453
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:45,090
The close-up.

454
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:46,525
Yeah.

455
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:48,427
Your father was trying
to get a picture of Eddy,

456
00:18:48,927 --> 00:18:51,430
but instead he got
a picture of his own chest.

457
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,699
This is Dad's...

458
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:54,967
That's his nipple.

459
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,369
(shudders)

460
00:18:57,703 --> 00:18:58,637
Can't wait to get to Bogart's.

461
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:01,039
I know just what
I'm going to get--

462
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,908
the barbecued
chicken breast

463
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:08,847
They have
the juiciest one in town.

464
00:19:08,847 --> 00:19:10,349
Or the lamb.

465
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:12,251
They serve an enormous rack.

466
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:15,120
That's great.

467
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:16,922
You might want to get
an overcoat of Frasier's

468
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:17,789
out of there.

469
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:19,791
It's supposed to be
pretty nippy tonight.

470
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:25,964
Oh, hi, Dad.
Where you going?
Hi

471
00:19:25,964 --> 00:19:26,965
Oh, Niles is here.

472
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:27,966
We're just going out for a bite.

473
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:28,967
Do you want to join us?

474
00:19:28,967 --> 00:19:30,269
Sure.

475
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,070
So, uh...

476
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:34,006
how's Lilith?

477
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:36,909
I just dropped her off
at the airport.

478
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:38,410
She's disappointed,
but she knows

479
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:40,212
that we're doing
the right thing.

480
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:42,781
Well, for what it's worth, I think you are, too, son.

481
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,583
Oh, thanks, Dad.

482
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:48,587
.
Just hope she finds
what's missing in her life

483
00:19:51,056 --> 00:19:52,925
Hey, Pasty

484
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:56,728
Oh, hello.

485
00:19:56,728 --> 00:19:57,729
May I?

486
00:19:57,729 --> 00:19:59,731
Yes, certainly.

487
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,234
What happened?

488
00:20:02,234 --> 00:20:04,236
I thought you were
relocating to Seattle.

489
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:05,737
Uh, it wasn't a fit.

490
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:07,706
I'm going back to Boston.

491
00:20:08,106 --> 00:20:09,675
I don't know,
call me neurotic.

492
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:12,644
I just can't work in a lab that's not immaculate.

493
00:20:15,113 --> 00:20:16,481
You work in a lab?

494
00:20:16,815 --> 00:20:18,383
Mmm, I'm a physicist.

495
00:20:18,817 --> 00:20:20,819
Really?

496
00:20:21,186 --> 00:20:23,755
My name's Lilith.

497
00:20:23,755 --> 00:20:25,190
Ah, the demon goddess.

498
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:27,559
Are you like the, uh..

499
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,829
independent fireball
that was your predecessor?

500
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:34,466
I make her look
like a vacillating cream puff.

501
00:20:34,466 --> 00:20:36,768
Albert

502
00:20:36,768 --> 00:20:39,238
What happened
with your friend?

503
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,739
Did you get your favor?

504
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,574
It's a long story.

505
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:44,910
Well, it's, uh...

506
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,412
it's a long flight.
