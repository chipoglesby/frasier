1
00:00:08,074 --> 00:00:09,542
Roz... Roz...

2
00:00:10,043 --> 00:00:11,044
(group cheering)

3
00:00:11,544 --> 00:00:14,080
Roz, you just missed
the classic prank of all time.

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,915
I'll admit it,
this was my masterpiece.

5
00:00:15,915 --> 00:00:17,650
Oh, who, who, who'd you get?

6
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:19,052
Way to go, Bulldog.

7
00:00:19,052 --> 00:00:20,053
(barks and snickers)

8
00:00:20,053 --> 00:00:21,121
There he is!

9
00:00:21,554 --> 00:00:23,056
(both laughing)

10
00:00:23,456 --> 00:00:26,026
I got this friend down at the impound lot

11
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:28,028
who came across a smashed-up BMW
--

12
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:30,030
same make and model and Frasier's.

13
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:31,331
You didn't!

14
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:32,565
You got Frasier!

15
00:00:32,565 --> 00:00:35,068
I had his car towed from the garage

16
00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:36,936
the wreck put in its place.

17
00:00:36,936 --> 00:00:38,238
(laughing)

18
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:40,306
The doc totally freaked
when he saw it.

19
00:00:40,306 --> 00:00:41,274
First, he started swearing

20
00:00:41,741 --> 00:00:42,809
then he implored the heavens

21
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:44,310
and just when his lips
started trembling

22
00:00:44,744 --> 00:00:46,579
Bulldog comes out,
tells him it's all a prank
.

23
00:00:46,846 --> 00:00:49,916
Hey, Bulldog observes
the mercy rule.

24
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:51,718
Besides, I got
the whole thing on tape.

25
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:53,553
(laughing)

26
00:00:57,057 --> 00:01:00,560
Admit it, Doc.
I got you good.

27
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,562
Come on, say it.

28
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:05,010
Bulldog's the best.

29
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:08,268
Okay, okay, how about
the bitch dance I taught you?

30
00:01:08,268 --> 00:01:09,269
(snickering)

31
00:01:09,702 --> 00:01:10,703
(laughing)

32
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,138
At least give me
one up high.

33
00:01:12,639 --> 00:01:15,108
Come on... ah, come on,
don't leave me hanging, Doc.

34
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:17,544
Where's your
Halloween spirit?

35
00:01:17,877 --> 00:01:19,946
Don't worry, it'll be
here waiting for you.

36
00:01:19,946 --> 00:01:20,947
(snickers)

37
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:28,688
For the record, I knew
immediately it was not my car.

38
00:01:28,688 --> 00:01:30,690
Mine has a bumper sticker
on it that says:

39
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:33,093
"I am pro-opera and I vote."

40
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:35,962
Frasier, you've got to admit it was clever.

41
00:01:35,962 --> 00:01:37,430
I admit nothing.
That is the last

42
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,732
we shall discuss of it.
We have a show to do.

43
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:42,469
Good afternoon, Seattle

44
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:44,437
and welcome
to the Halloween edition

45
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:45,939
of the Dr. Frasier Crane Show.

46
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:49,909
Today, we will be discussing
the topic of fears.

47
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:52,312
Are they irrational
hindrances or...

48
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:54,314
evolutionary tools.

49
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:56,316
Hmm.

50
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:59,619
The surprising answer...
after these words.

51
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:02,956
FRASIER (on tape):
My car!

52
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:05,458
Oh, not my car!

53
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,727
What did they do to you?

54
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:08,995
My baby!

55
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:14,000
Whenever you're ready.

56
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,836
(door shuts)

57
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,876
(knocking)

58
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:24,310
(doorbell ringing)

59
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,845
Did you find something?

60
00:02:25,845 --> 00:02:28,581
Do you think they'll take soy sauce packets?

61
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:31,284
Who keeps ringing the doorbell?

62
00:02:31,784 --> 00:02:32,685
Mum! Shh!

63
00:02:32,685 --> 00:02:34,387
(quietly):
It's trick-or-treaters.

64
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:35,555
It's okay, they're gone.

65
00:02:35,555 --> 00:02:37,123
Well, why didn't you
let them in?

66
00:02:37,123 --> 00:02:40,560
Because someone forgot
to get Halloween candy.

67
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:42,495
Although someone else
could've picked it up

68
00:02:42,962 --> 00:02:44,397
since she was already
in the store.

69
00:02:44,397 --> 00:02:46,799
Well, that would override the duty list

70
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,569
that someone insisted on implementing.

71
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:51,337
If this is what you two
call a fight

72
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,273
you're not fit
to be married.

73
00:02:54,974 --> 00:02:57,677
I once held your father's head underwater and...

74
00:02:57,977 --> 00:02:58,511
(doorbell rings)

75
00:02:59,045 --> 00:03:00,513
Shh!
Oh, for heaven's sake!

76
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:03,950
We haven't got any candy!
Shove off!

77
00:03:04,984 --> 00:03:07,487
Great. Now they know
we're here.

78
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:08,755
(doorbell rings)

79
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:11,491
That's precisely what's wrong with this country.

80
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:13,993
Everyone's afraid
to stand up to the children.

81
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:15,995
Trick or treat.

82
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:17,463
Didn't you hear?

83
00:03:17,463 --> 00:03:18,898
We've got no candy!

84
00:03:18,898 --> 00:03:21,334
We can offer you hotel soaps.

85
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:23,336
But it's Halloween.

86
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:25,672
I dress up, you give me candy.

87
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:28,341
That costume's
supposed to be scary?

88
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:30,577
No. Is yours?

89
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:34,414
Oh, a nice bite into an onion

90
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:36,316
is what that mouth of yours deserves.

91
00:03:36,649 --> 00:03:39,052
If you don't have treats, you're going to get a trick.

92
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:40,353
Do your worst!

93
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:41,688
I'’’m not afraid of you.

94
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:44,857
Honestly!

95
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:47,860
Okay, well, maybe I'll

96
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,195
go pick up
some candy after all.

97
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:53,199
(loud splattering)

98
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:07,280
Okay, I'm going to need
my slicker and my squash goggles.

99
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,622
FRASIER:
Good morning, Roz.

100
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:16,589
May I join you?

101
00:04:17,123 --> 00:04:18,057
Sure, Frasier.

102
00:04:18,057 --> 00:04:20,126
Well, I'm glad to see
you're not sulking today.

103
00:04:20,126 --> 00:04:22,562
Yes, well, I had a little time to think about it

104
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:25,431
and I've decided to put Bulldog's prank behind me.

105
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:27,233
That's very mature.

106
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:28,568
I'm not finished.

107
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:30,403
By visiting upon him a prank

108
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:32,438
that is ten times more dastardly

109
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:34,474
Look at this.

110
00:04:37,243 --> 00:04:39,812
It looks like a car
with a balloon tied to it.

111
00:04:39,812 --> 00:04:41,247
Precisely!

112
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:44,083
I will tie a red balloon
to the antenna of Bulldog's car

113
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:48,087
every time his precious Seahawks
lose a game.

114
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:49,856
Over time...

115
00:04:50,156 --> 00:04:53,726
the conditioned response will
become ingrained in his psyche.

116
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:56,162
Eventually, the mere sight
of a red balloon...

117
00:04:56,162 --> 00:04:59,098
will bring about in him an inexplicable sense

118
00:04:59,532 --> 00:05:02,035
of loss.

119
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:07,206
Check and mate

120
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:08,975
Isn't that kind of out there?

121
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,376
That's the point.

122
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:13,279
Well, of course I could resort
to any of your basic pranks:

123
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,781
hand in warm water and whatnot--

124
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:17,283
believe me, I have an intimate
knowledge of all of them--

125
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:19,619
but what I'm looking for is
something unmistakably

126
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,487
me.

127
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,757
A signature prank, if you will, hmm?

128
00:05:24,957 --> 00:05:26,526
Why don't you just
forget about revenge

129
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:28,294
and give him
his two minutes in the sun?

130
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:29,095
At my expense?

131
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:30,596
Look at his life.

132
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,098
You guys used to be equals

133
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:35,601
now he's stuck downstairs
that dark, musty archives room.

134
00:05:35,601 --> 00:05:38,037
You must have some sympathy
for him, don't you?

135
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:39,505
Dark musty archives.

136
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:41,507
I think I can use that

137
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,510
Hello, all.
Hi.

138
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,478
Hello, Niles.

139
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:47,013
Why do we have to stop here?

140
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,514
I could make coffee at home.

141
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:50,016
Now, now.

142
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:52,518
It's good to get
out of the house--

143
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:54,887
get some fresh air,
exercise those lungs.

144
00:05:55,154 --> 00:05:57,223
My lungs are as strong as ever.

145
00:05:57,223 --> 00:06:01,227
Just yesterday, I finished
a whole cigarette in two drags.

146
00:06:03,796 --> 00:06:06,332
One off me record.

147
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:07,800
What's this?

148
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:09,802
I'm devising
the ultimate prank

149
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:11,304
to get my revenge
on Bulldog.

150
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:13,306
Ah, well, just beware
the dangers

151
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:15,074
of juvenile
one-upsmanship.

152
00:06:15,074 --> 00:06:18,344
Only last night, Mrs. Moon
challenged a trick-or-treater

153
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:21,280
and he responded by pelting
our door with eggs.

154
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:23,750
Yeah, but I got
the little monster back

155
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:27,754
by puttin' a big, greasy glob of
Vaseline on his doorknob.

156
00:06:29,288 --> 00:06:30,857
You said you'd put
an e

157
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:32,358
Hence, the Vaseline.

158
00:06:32,358 --> 00:06:35,094
Mum, he's a child.

159
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:37,864
Well, it's time he learned you don't
mess with Gertrude Moon

160
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:39,766
without incurring my wrath.

161
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:42,201
Now, excuse me.

162
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:44,203
I require cocoa.

163
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:48,541
You know, I think she
has the right attitude

164
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:50,376
If I expect Bulldog
to leave me alone

165
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:52,712
I've got to show him
he's dealing with a superior intellect.

166
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:54,547
Show them the balloon car.

167
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,890
I'm sure da Vinci's early no
were full of laughs, too.

168
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:06,893
Excuse me.
I have devising to do.

169
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:11,731
That'll be... $32.03.

170
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:14,033
For one drink?

171
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:15,301
Your grandson ordered
a bunch of cakes

172
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:16,736
and he said it was all on you.

173
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:20,006
Thanks for the
treats, Grandma!

174
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:21,908
Hey...!

175
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:30,917
Oh, let's see the little sod get to
school without these.

176
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:32,752
Oh, this should settle it.

177
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,361
(thunder crashes)

178
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:47,667
Is anybody there?

179
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:50,102
(deadpan):
Oh. Zombies.

180
00:07:50,102 --> 00:07:51,604
The living dead.

181
00:07:52,104 --> 00:07:55,107
Help. Help

182
00:07:55,107 --> 00:07:57,443
FRASIER:
Everyone hold, please.

183
00:08:00,112 --> 00:08:02,448
Zombie Number Two,
what are you doing?

184
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:04,951
I'm scaring Bulldog?

185
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:07,954
I see.

186
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:10,957
Is that what zombies do?
They scare people?

187
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:12,925
Um...
Wrong!

188
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:17,296
They eat brains,
and that's what scares people.

189
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:19,665
All right, now,
this is our dress rehearsal.

190
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:21,434
Let's please try
to get this right.

191
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:23,636
Bulldog comes in,
he hears noises

192
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:27,073
zombies go after his brain...

193
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:28,941
and his terror
is caught on videotape

194
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:31,444
for us all to enjoy
at a later date, all right?

195
00:08:31,944 --> 00:08:33,946
Now, let's try this again.
First marks, please.

196
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:35,248
Oh, geez, Fras

197
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:36,549
This is the fourth time
through.

198
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:38,050
Can somebody else
play Bulldog now?

199
00:08:38,484 --> 00:08:39,485
Dad, you said you'd
help me with this.

200
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:41,487
You said we were going
to do a practical joke.

201
00:08:41,487 --> 00:08:42,321
I thought it'd be fun.

202
00:08:42,588 --> 00:08:44,490
Whatever gave you that idea?

203
00:08:46,058 --> 00:08:48,127
Todd...

204
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:50,396
I am getting "dead"
from you

205
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:53,165
but I'm not getting "undead."

206
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:55,501
Still.

207
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:59,972
Let's try this, then.

208
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:05,011
After rehearsal, I want each
of you to write a paragraph...

209
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:09,882
detailing who your character
was when he or she was alive...

210
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:12,218
how they died...

211
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:16,022
and why they are now
after Bulldog's brain.

212
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:17,890
Honestly, Roz, you know,
you haven't given me

213
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:18,891
much to work with here.

214
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:21,160
There are the worst actors
I've ever seen!

215
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,930
I'm sorry, but the Royal Zombie Company
just left town

216
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,432
with its all-zombie production
of Hamlet.

217
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:30,903
How many more times
are we going to do this?

218
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:34,173
Why is it that whenever
Bulldog pulls a practical joke

219
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:35,174
you all applaud him

220
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:38,177
as if he's won
some sort of bowl or cup

221
00:09:38,177 --> 00:09:39,545
or other sports dish?

222
00:09:39,545 --> 00:09:41,380
But when I ask you to give up
a single Sunday

223
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,281
all I get is complaints.

224
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:43,683
Because you keep
turning it into work.

225
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:45,184
This is supposed to be fun!

226
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:46,652
Like a day at the beach.

227
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:49,088
You do this kind
of thing all the time.
Like when?

228
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:52,358
Like the last time
we went to the beach.

229
00:09:52,558 --> 00:09:55,428
A lot of people bring rakes!

230
00:09:58,197 --> 00:09:59,765
Frasier, it's not too late to back out of this.

231
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:01,167
Now, face it

232
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,935
jokes just aren't your specialty.

233
00:10:03,202 --> 00:10:04,270
What is that supposed to mean?

234
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,271
Well, what she means, son

235
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,540
is that we all have
our different blessings

236
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,241
and Bulldog's good
at jokes and fun.

237
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:11,310
You're good at...

238
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:12,812
reading and, uh...

239
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:16,182
telling people about
the things you read.

240
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:18,517
Are you saying that you think
I can't pull this off?

241
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:19,919
Oh, I wouldn't put it that way

242
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:21,854
I would.

243
00:10:21,854 --> 00:10:23,756
But I worked this out
to the last detail!

244
00:10:24,256 --> 00:10:25,091
Nothing can go wrong!

245
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:26,859
Everything's going to go wrong!

246
00:10:26,859 --> 00:10:29,261
For one thing, Bulldog's
going to know something's up

247
00:10:29,261 --> 00:10:31,130
'cause Kenny hardly ever
makes him work at night.

248
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:32,431
And then, look at all these cameras

249
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:34,433
and all these wires--
what if he spots these?

250
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:36,502
And the zombies,
as soon as he sees them

251
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:38,938
.
he's going to know it's a prank,
'cause he just pranked you

252
00:10:39,271 --> 00:10:42,308
And there are no such things as zombies!

253
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:54,487
You, sir...
are released!

254
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:57,957
And you, as well!

255
00:10:57,957 --> 00:10:59,258
I'll pull this
thing off by myself

256
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:02,061
proving that you don't know what
you're talking about!

257
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:04,130
I don't need any of you!

258
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:06,932
Wait, zombies, I do need you.

259
00:11:06,932 --> 00:11:09,235
But no one else!

260
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:10,036
I'll show all of you!

261
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:12,038
You mark my words!

262
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:14,306
Tomorrow night,
I get my revenge!

263
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:17,143
(thunder crashes)

264
00:11:17,643 --> 00:11:20,146
Ah, good, the effects
machine's working again.

265
00:11:20,646 --> 00:11:21,647
All right, everyone...

266
00:11:21,647 --> 00:11:23,649
back to your first marks.

267
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,587
(doorbell chimes)

268
00:11:28,587 --> 00:11:30,089
Where have you been?!

269
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:32,458
I'm sorry. I had a hard ti
me finding this place.

270
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:35,061
I checked the directory
for "Crane"

271
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:35,828
but it had "Old Bat"

272
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:37,697
next to this apartment number.

273
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:43,002
A little obvious, but not bad.

274
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:45,538
I want you to deliver this

275
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,973
Baby-I-Have-To-Tinkle doll

276
00:11:47,973 --> 00:11:51,977
to Jason White,
Floyd Middle School.

277
00:11:51,977 --> 00:11:53,979
This is the address.

278
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:57,817
I mean, he should be
in gym class about now

279
00:11:57,817 --> 00:11:59,185
I don't think I'm allowed

280
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:00,686
to just walk into the school, ma'am.

281
00:12:00,686 --> 00:12:03,656
Oh, it's okay.
I'm his grandmother.

282
00:12:03,656 --> 00:12:05,591
And you have to say this:

283
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:08,494
"Your mommy said
bring this to you at school

284
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:09,995
"to lift your spirits.

285
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:13,799
See, your dolly
has accidents, too."

286
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:16,001
You really want me
to say that?

287
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:17,536
Yes, and very loudly.

288
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:20,339
The poor thing's hard of hearing.

289
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:23,676
Yes!

290
00:12:30,716 --> 00:12:34,220
Todd, take off
that baseball cap.

291
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,555
You're undead, not uncouth

292
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:39,291
All right, everyone.

293
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:42,661
Step lively,
look sharp.

294
00:12:42,661 --> 00:12:44,163
It's almost show time.

295
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:47,166
Give me a final
room-tone check, please

296
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:48,100
and take your marks.

297
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,536
Hey, Fras.

298
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:52,905
Oh, hello.

299
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:55,074
Come to watch me fail,
I suppose.

300
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:56,876
No, we just wanted
to come join you.

301
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:58,738
We're sorry about that stuff
we said yesterday.

302
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,982
It's long overdue.

303
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:05,785
Maybe I don't want you here.

304
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:06,685
What do you mean?

305
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:08,621
You abandoned me
in my hour of need.

306
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,589
Now you're here
to revel in my success

307
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:12,992
just like in Boswell's
Life of Johnson.

308
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:14,894
What?

309
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:18,330
It was something I read.

310
00:13:20,766 --> 00:13:24,770
I guess we deserve that,
whatever the hell it means.

311
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:27,773
Come on, Frasier, we're sorry.

312
00:13:27,773 --> 00:13:29,175
Just let us watch.

313
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:32,077
All right.
Apology accepted.

314
00:13:32,077 --> 00:13:33,846
You may observe
in silence.

315
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:36,448
Make yourselves
comfortable

316
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:38,751
and prepare to witness a man

317
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:41,754
brought to the very edge
of madness!

318
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:47,760
I think
he's already there.

319
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:53,132
Mum, we're off to the symphony.

320
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:55,901
Haven't the Germans
punished us enough?

321
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,672
Ooh!
Bloody hell!

322
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:02,041
Where did this come from?

323
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:05,611
Oh, you must have
crossed someone.

324
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:07,880
Mother.

325
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,849
Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry.

326
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,817
We were just coming
down the hall

327
00:14:11,817 --> 00:14:13,285
and we saw you
open your door.

328
00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:14,720
This is our trash can.

329
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,121
What was it
doing there?

330
00:14:16,121 --> 00:14:16,989
Jason, get back here!

331
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:19,825
It seems our children
have been feuding.

332
00:14:19,825 --> 00:14:21,627
We're very embarrassed

333
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:23,696
You're embarrassed?
Meet our daughter.

334
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,769
Hello.

335
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:32,171
I have a lot of homework.

336
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:33,138
Stay!

337
00:14:33,138 --> 00:14:35,641
Jason, have you been
fighting with this woman?

338
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:37,176
Well, she broke my bike

339
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:40,446
and made me have to see
a counselor at school.

340
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:43,148
I think I left something
in the kitchen.

341
00:14:43,148 --> 00:14:45,084
Stay!

342
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:46,485
I am an adult.

343
00:14:46,485 --> 00:14:48,854
I can do anything I want!

344
00:14:48,854 --> 00:14:51,223
No. While you're living
under our roof

345
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:52,558
you'll follow our rules.

346
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:56,295
You two should be
ashamed of yourselves.

347
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:57,563
What if someone got hurt?

348
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:58,330
Good.

349
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:00,833
Jason! You are
one second away

350
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:03,335
from losing
your broadband
connection.

351
00:15:03,335 --> 00:15:05,337
Now, apologize
and shake hands.

352
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:09,975
Pish.

353
00:15:09,975 --> 00:15:12,411
What if I told you
you couldn't smoke your pipes

354
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:13,379
in your room anymore?

355
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:15,848
I'm sorry.
Sorry.

356
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:19,952
Now you two are go
ing to clean up this mess.

357
00:15:19,952 --> 00:15:22,187
And Jason,
come straight home
when you're finished.

358
00:15:22,187 --> 00:15:26,091
This place better be spotless
by the time we get back.

359
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,863
I wish I was all grown up
and I wouldn't have

360
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:33,399
to follow
their stupid rules.

361
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:36,402
Oh, nothing changes,
trust me.

362
00:15:38,904 --> 00:15:40,673
You know...

363
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:42,541
my mom hates bugs.

364
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:44,310
She screams like a girl.

365
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:48,414
So does my son-in-law.

366
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:50,649
I know where
we can find some crickets.

367
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:53,986
No! Now, we should
 do as we're told

368
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:55,888
and start cleaning up.

369
00:15:56,388 --> 00:15:57,323
Okay.

370
00:15:57,323 --> 00:16:00,793
That way they won't
be expecting it.

371
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:02,795
(both giggle)

372
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,735
This is so great!
I can't wait.

373
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:10,803
I'm getting goose bumps.

374
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:14,306
Feel me. Feel me.

375
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,809
Kenny, what was
the condition

376
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:18,674
of my letting you watch?

377
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:24,683
There he is!

378
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:27,419
Cue "creaking noise one."

379
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:29,221
(creaking noise)

380
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:34,727
Hello?

381
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:35,661
Who's there?

382
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:38,564
Cue "creaking noise two."

383
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:40,499
(different creaking noise)

384
00:16:44,803 --> 00:16:48,440
Now let the horror begin.

385
00:16:50,275 --> 00:16:52,111
(shrieking)

386
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:53,612
Yes!

387
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:55,948
How do you like that,
you big baby?!

388
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:57,549
(Frasier laughing)

389
00:17:00,285 --> 00:17:01,286
Get back!

390
00:17:01,286 --> 00:17:03,255
(gunshot)

391
00:17:03,255 --> 00:17:04,123
Oh, my God!

392
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:05,324
Oh, my God!

393
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:06,158
Call 911!

394
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,627
Call 911!

395
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:11,196
Oh, my God!

396
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:14,199
Don't worry about it, Kenny.
It's just a joke.

397
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:15,701
What are you talking about?

398
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:17,002
It's a fake gun!

399
00:17:17,002 --> 00:17:17,636
What?!

400
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,905
It's a fake gun!

401
00:17:19,905 --> 00:17:21,306
What about the bullets?

402
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:24,309
It's a joke.

403
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:26,779
Bulldog found out about Frasier's prank

404
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:29,281
so we set him up.

405
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:30,249
That is awesome!

406
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:32,985
I can't believe he fell for it

407
00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:34,820
Come on, we got to tell
Frasier what's going on.

408
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:35,821
You guys go ahead.

409
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:37,856
I think I'm going
to stay here and puke.

410
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:45,164
Stop! Stop!
It was all a joke!

411
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:47,966
Oh, my God!
What have I done?!

412
00:17:47,966 --> 00:17:50,235
What's the big deal?
He was already a zombie.

413
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:52,004
(raucous laughter)

414
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:53,672
Are you insane?!
Call an ambulance!

415
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:55,007
(yells)

416
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:00,512
(laughing)

417
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:03,982
What's going on here?

418
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:05,117
Wave to the camera, Frasier.

419
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:07,519
What?

420
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:09,354
Got you again,
all on tape.

421
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:11,590
Who's the king?

422
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,959
That isn't funny!
I could've had a heart attack!

423
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:17,129
Oh, sorry, Fras.
We just couldn't resist.

424
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:19,398
Well, at least
nobody was hurt.

425
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:21,900
You've bested me,
Bulldog-- again.

426
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,902
Dr. Crane, I think
I hurt my back.

427
00:18:23,902 --> 00:18:24,736
What?

428
00:18:24,736 --> 00:18:26,905
(all gasp)

429
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:27,739
Oh, my God!

430
00:18:27,739 --> 00:18:29,208
Someone call
an ambulance!

431
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,709
Where's the phone?!
Where's the phone?!

432
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:33,946
Get the first-aid kit
out of the closet!

433
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,214
No, no! Not the...!

434
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:38,383
(shrieks)

435
00:18:38,383 --> 00:18:40,719
What the hell's going on
down here?!

436
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:42,054
Quiet, everybody!

437
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:44,556
Hello. Yes, I'd like to report

438
00:18:44,556 --> 00:18:47,392
the greatest practical joke ever!

439
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:49,261
You better send a firetruck

440
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:52,164
because you guys just got burned!

441
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:58,170
(laughing)

442
00:18:58,170 --> 00:18:59,071
Wait. What?

443
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:00,572
Hi, Roz.

444
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:01,974
Oh!

445
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:07,379
You should see the look
on your faces!

446
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,881
This is truly a classic.

447
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:11,383
This was all just a joke?

448
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:12,384
Awesome!

449
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:18,257
Nice work, Doc.

450
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:19,758
Likewise, Bulldog.

451
00:19:19,758 --> 00:19:22,761
Think I can get a copy of this
for my demo reel?

452
00:19:22,761 --> 00:19:23,762
Sure thing, Todd.

453
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:26,165
You've come a long way
in a short time, young man.

454
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:29,935
Well, Frasier, I'm speechless

455
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:31,637
You totally had us going.

456
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:32,971
I can't believe it!

457
00:19:32,971 --> 00:19:33,972
Admit it, Roz

458
00:19:33,972 --> 00:19:35,874
can I pull off a practical joke or what?

459
00:19:35,874 --> 00:19:36,775
I just don't understand.

460
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:38,177
Did you guys work together?

461
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,978
Frasier set the whole thing up.

462
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:41,480
The other day, after you two left

463
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,481
I got to thinking

464
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:44,983
maybe my joke was aimed
at the wrong target.

465
00:19:44,983 --> 00:19:47,319
That's when Bulldog and I joined forces.

466
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:50,055
But we joined forces with him to get you!

467
00:19:50,055 --> 00:19:52,791
That's exactly what you were supposed to think.

468
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:55,093
Wow, Fras,
I got to give it to you.

469
00:19:55,093 --> 00:19:56,028
This was brilliant.

470
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:56,962
Thank you, Dad.

471
00:19:56,962 --> 00:19:58,964
What do you say
we all go upstairs

472
00:19:58,964 --> 00:19:59,865
and watch the tape?

473
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,800
You guys go ahead.

474
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,135
Bulldog?
Yeah?

475
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:06,438
Technically, I still
owe you one.

476
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:09,308
Face it, Doc, you will never win.

477
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:10,842
Good work, Noel.

478
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:18,517
That's why you had to join forces with me.

479
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:19,451
Huh?

480
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:23,655
You're right.

481
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:24,990

492
00:21:03,895 --> 00:21:05,897

00:21:06,398 --> 00:21:09,901
Good night, Seattle!
We love you!
