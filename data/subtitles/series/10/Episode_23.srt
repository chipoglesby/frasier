1
00:00:08,541 --> 00:00:11,044
Well, I think we've got time for one last caller.

2
00:00:11,044 --> 00:00:12,045
Roz, who've we got?

3
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:14,080
Mm-hmm.

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,582
Mm-hmm.

5
00:00:15,582 --> 00:00:17,417
(pencil clatters )

6
00:00:20,754 --> 00:00:22,756
Well, I suppose I'll be fielding this last one myself.

7
00:00:22,756 --> 00:00:24,190
Let's try line two.

8
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:27,227
Go ahead, caller, your name
and your problem, please.

9
00:00:27,227 --> 00:00:28,762
Yes, sir. My name's Ernie.

10
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:31,264
And I'm real angry
at my dog.

11
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,269
Okay, Ernie.
Uh, very often when, uh,

12
00:00:36,269 --> 00:00:38,271
people have
feelings towards their pets,

13
00:00:38,271 --> 00:00:41,274
it often reflects feelings
they have about themselves

14
00:00:41,274 --> 00:00:42,776
and their place in society.

15
00:00:42,776 --> 00:00:46,246
So, tell me, why are you
angry at your dog?

16
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:50,784
Well, he keeps telling me
to take off my foil helmet.

17
00:00:57,791 --> 00:01:00,293
You hold on, Ernie. Um...

18
00:01:00,293 --> 00:01:02,796
Someone will come on the line
with the number of an expert

19
00:01:02,796 --> 00:01:04,297
in this sort of situation.

20
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:09,302
Let's try, uh, line four
.

21
00:01:09,302 --> 00:01:11,204
ROZ: Oh, yes, of cours
e I'm interested.

22
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:12,972
I'll fax my resume right over.

23
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:18,812
Well, the news is up next,

24
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:20,747
followed
by the market update

25
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:21,681
with Julia Wilcox.

26
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:23,183
That's it for me today.

27
00:01:23,183 --> 00:01:26,619
This is Dr. Frasier Crane saying
good day and good mental health.

28
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:29,923
Another great show, Doc.

29
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:31,624
Did you even listen?

30
00:01:31,891 --> 00:01:33,460
You don't have to eat
every Big Mac to know

31
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:34,794
it's a delicious
hamburger sandwich.

32
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:37,630
Roz, what's going on?

33
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:40,133
I'm sorry, but they want
to interview me

34
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:42,001
for the program director job
at KPXY.

35
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:44,771
Well, that's great, but I didn't even know you were looking.

36
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,507
I wasn't. They just
called me out of the blue.

37
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:49,275
I'm actually shocked

38
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:51,611
because I have very limited
experience in management, but...

39
00:01:51,978 --> 00:01:53,847
Well, Kenny's in management; how hard can it be?

40
00:01:55,982 --> 00:01:57,050
Hey, it's not that easy.

41
00:01:57,517 --> 00:02:00,520
I know it looks like a monkey
can do my job, but it can't.

42
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,488
True story.

43
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:05,358
Well, gosh, Roz, I...

44
00:02:05,358 --> 00:02:07,861
I must say, I've got sort
of mixed feelings about this.

45
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:09,295
I couldn't be happier
that you're finally getting

46
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:11,264
the recognition you deserve, but..

47
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:12,632
but I'm
going to miss you.

48
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:15,034
Well, let's wait till
there's a real offer

49
00:02:15,034 --> 00:02:17,871
before we break out
the Kleenex and champagne.

50
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:18,705
Okay.

51
00:02:20,206 --> 00:02:22,709
Well, Roz, Kenny told me
about your job interview.

52
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:23,576
Good luck.

53
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,044
Oh, I get it.

54
00:02:25,044 --> 00:02:26,846
It'll be good luck

55
00:02:27,113 --> 00:02:29,182
because if I get the
job, I'll be gone.

56
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:31,651
No, it sounds like
a good position for you.

57
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:34,187
Right, 'cause I get into a lot of

58
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:37,690
sexual positions
with a lot of guys

59
00:02:38,124 --> 00:02:40,493
I'm saying congratulations

60
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:43,296
Oh. Thank you.

61
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:45,298
What's her problem?

62
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:46,799
Oh, I...

63
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:50,904
Well, you're being

64
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:53,373
uncharacteristically
decent today.

65
00:02:53,706 --> 00:02:54,741
You all right?

66
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:55,742
I'm fine.

67
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:58,611
All right, I might as well
tell you before he does.

68
00:02:58,978 --> 00:03:00,513
Avery and I broke up.

69
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:04,350
Oh. Gosh, uh, what happened?

70
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:08,021
I got tired of listening to him
promise he'd leave his wife.

71
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:11,057
Well, I'm sorry.

72
00:03:11,057 --> 00:03:12,759
I realize you must
be going through..

73
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:14,327
Oh, I don't need
your sympathy, okay?

74
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:17,197
I'm not one of your pathetic code three whackadoos.

75
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,432
I was just
trying to help

76
00:03:19,432 --> 00:03:21,834
No need to insult
my callers.

77
00:03:21,834 --> 00:03:22,769
Foil Helmet Guy says

78
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:24,804
his dog needs
to speak to you.

79
00:03:35,114 --> 00:03:37,584
Oh. Excuse me, uh...
Hi, Daph.

80
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:39,085
Hello.
Gosh, I've never
 seen this place so crowded.

81
00:03:39,085 --> 00:03:40,086
What's the occasion?

82
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:41,120
It's Mum's day off.

83
00:03:41,588 --> 00:03:43,389
Apparently,
there was a mass e-mail.

84
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:47,260
So, is Niles going to be joining us?

85
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:49,596
No. He's taking your father
to the shooting range.

86
00:03:49,862 --> 00:03:51,431
Oh, yes, yes, of course.
I had forgotten.

87
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:52,932
He'd asked me to take him,

88
00:03:52,932 --> 00:03:54,434
but then I suggested
that when it comes to guns,

89
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:58,805
perhaps he would prefer
someone of Niles's caliber

90
00:03:58,805 --> 00:03:59,939
(chuckling)

91
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:02,208
I'm in rare form today.

92
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:03,676
You should see this place

93
00:04:03,676 --> 00:04:05,545
when they know
you're not coming.

94
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:07,914
JULIA:
No, Avery, it's...

95
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:10,984
two-thirds of the work
on that program is mine.

96
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:14,487
Well, I don't have
 to prove it; it's a fact!

97
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:17,457
Oh. Oh, yeah?

98
00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:19,425
Well, I should
have expected as
much from a man

99
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:21,794
who wears leopard
print bikini briefs.

100
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:27,667
Avery McManus wears shiny acetate man panties!

101
00:04:33,072 --> 00:04:34,974
Excuse me.

102
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:39,512
Is everything okay?

103
00:04:39,512 --> 00:04:43,016
No. Now that I've dump
ed your bastard accountant,

104
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:46,419
he's trying to cut me out of our software program.

105
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:47,787
Software program?

106
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:50,657
We-- mostly me-- developed
a proprietary method

107
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:53,159
for analyzing
price/volume momentum--

108
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:55,061
I call it
vector scaling--

109
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:57,964
that can quantify the likelihood
of longer term trends.

110
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,799
Do you realize what that means?

111
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:02,969
It's good?

112
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,304
That program is my baby.

113
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,306
I have been working on it for months.

114
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,274
I think your
bastard accountant

115
00:05:08,274 --> 00:05:10,510
has been using me all along

116
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:12,111
Thanks for
setting us up.

117
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,680
I did no such thing.

118
00:05:13,946 --> 00:05:15,014
You know what I ought to do?

119
00:05:15,014 --> 00:05:17,016
I ought to go down to
his office, demand my files,

120
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:18,518
and then trash
the place.

121
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:19,485
Ju-Just a second.
Just a second.

122
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:22,021
Just sit down.
Sit down, please.

123
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:24,857
Take a moment
to calm down

124
00:05:24,857 --> 00:05:27,193
before you make
any rash decisions.

125
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,028
In a few hours, I'm
leaving town for a week.

126
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:31,030
There's no way I'm leaving your bastard accountant

127
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:33,032
in control of those files.

128
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:34,534
All right, well,
if you insist,

129
00:05:34,534 --> 00:05:36,035
then perhaps
I should go with you.

130
00:05:36,035 --> 00:05:37,804
Maybe I can help
facilitate things.

131
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:38,971
Why? What's in it for you?

132
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:41,874
Nothing. Surely you can
conceive of the possibility

133
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:45,645
that someone might want to
just do something nice for you?

134
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:47,780
You and Avery are in this
together, aren't you?

135
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:51,084
Of course not. You're not
being rational, you know.

136
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:54,120
Perhaps Avery is just holding
your program hostage

137
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,388
because he feels hurt.

138
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:56,989
Perhaps this is

139
00:05:56,989 --> 00:05:59,158
his clumsy way of trying
to initiate a dialogue.

140
00:06:00,593 --> 00:06:03,396
You really do try to see
the best in everyone, don't you?

141
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:05,631
Yes, I do.

142
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:10,203
So, what do you see
when you look at me?

143
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:14,974
Well...

144
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:16,976
I see a woman
who's been hurt,

145
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:19,879
not once but many times.

146
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:23,316
A woman who finds it
so difficult to trust someone

147
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:26,285
that she won't allow
herself to be vulnerable.

148
00:06:26,285 --> 00:06:28,755
A woman whose eyes
are going to get stuck

149
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:31,257
if she keeps rolling them
like that!

150
00:06:36,262 --> 00:06:38,264
(loud gunfire)

151
00:06:45,271 --> 00:06:48,274
Ah! Look at that grouping.

152
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:50,777
Hey, uh, Dad,
you about ready to go?

153
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:53,212
I guess I've still
got the touch.

154
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:55,615
Hey, Niles, you ought to give it a try.

155
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:58,117
Thanks, Dad. You know
how I feel about handguns.

156
00:06:58,117 --> 00:06:59,619
They breed violence.

157
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:01,120
Oh, come on. This is just simple

158
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,624
target shooting,
that's all.

159
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:06,092
(laughing)

160
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,593
Yeah.

161
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,030
Here's one dirtbag that isn't going to be selling crack

162
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:13,299
at any schoolyards anytime soon.

163
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:18,604
You should listen to the man.

164
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:20,406
Shooting is a great sport.

165
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,108
Red Brewer.

166
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:24,944
And these clowns here
are Mitch and Wayne.

167
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:25,812
Hello.
Wayne.

168
00:07:26,312 --> 00:07:27,313
Mitch.
Hi.

169
00:07:27,313 --> 00:07:29,148
I'm Niles Crane. This
is my father Martin Crane.

170
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:30,650
Oh. Hi.
How you doing, guys?

171
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,485
Listen, Niles, let me
show you how to do this.

172
00:07:32,885 --> 00:07:33,953
I think you'll enjoy it.

173
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,922
Oh...
It's pretty simple.

174
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:37,824
You just take a solid stance,

175
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:39,392
hold the grip firmly,

176
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:41,394
steady your gun hand
with your other,

177
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:42,895
fingers to fingers,
thumb to thumb.

178
00:07:42,895 --> 00:07:45,898
Focus on the front sight
and squeeze the trigger.

179
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:49,335
Okay? You try it.

180
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:51,904
Oh, you know, no offense,
but I, uh, I just...

181
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:53,339
I'm not real comfortable
with guns.

182
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:55,274
You know, Mitch used
to be that way, too.

183
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:56,609
MITCH:
Yeah.

184
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:58,611
The only weapon I'd
go near was a bow and arrow.

185
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:02,882
I, uh, I got an archery
badge at day camp.

186
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:05,718
This is like archery
but safer.

187
00:08:05,718 --> 00:08:07,220
The weapon's more stable,

188
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,187
and you're
in a controlled environment.

189
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:10,189
Go on, give
it a try, son.

190
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:12,692
Well, I... just,
I'll do one little one.

191
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:18,197
Just remember, stance,
grip, aim, relax, shoot.

192
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:19,198
Okay.

193
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:20,199
Stance.

194
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:21,200
Grip.

195
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,201
Aim.

196
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:23,202
Relax.

197
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:24,203
Shoot.

198
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:28,207
Did I do it?

199
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:31,210
You not only did it,
you hit the target.

200
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:33,546
See? Sixth ring out.

201
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:35,381
Look at the kid, he hit
the target his first time.

202
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:36,382
Not bad, kid.

203
00:08:36,382 --> 00:08:38,684
Way to go, kid.
That's my kid.

204
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:40,953
That was, uh, that was
a unique experience.

205
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:43,389
I'm sure I'll dine out
on that story for months.

206
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:44,857
Don't quit now,
go again.

207
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:46,359
But remember, this time,

208
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,361
squeeze the trigger,
don't pull.

209
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:49,862
Okay.

210
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:51,364
Squeeze...

211
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:52,865
(muttering)

212
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:55,868
(guffaws)

213
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:57,370
Wow. You're pretty good at this.

214
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,071
The kid's a natural,
am I right?

215
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:00,406
(laughing)
: Yeah.

216
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:01,841
Can I go again?

217
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:02,742
Yeah.

218
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,756
What took you so long?

219
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:18,257
I was looking
for street parking

220
00:09:18,257 --> 00:09:20,760
Do you have any idea how much this garage charges?

221
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:23,896
Avery's not here.
Oh, great.

222
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:25,765
It cost me $3.50 to find that out.

223
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:28,267
No, it's good. It'll
make it easier for me

224
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:29,268
to get my program back.

225
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:30,269
What do you mean?

226
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:31,771
I know his keypad code.

227
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:33,606
Wh-Wh-What...? That
is breaking and entering.

228
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:35,741
Oh, if you're so scared,
why don't you just leave?

229
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:38,277
Well, I'm-I'm not scared. I... I'm...

230
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:41,414
I'll have you know, I've had

231
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:42,615
my fair share of escapades.

232
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:45,084
Back in med school, I once dressed a cadaver..

233
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:46,452
Oh, here's my program.

234
00:09:46,852 --> 00:09:49,336
Okay, good. Now,
just in case he backed it up,

235
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:53,059
I'm going to delete everything from his hard drive.

236
00:09:53,392 --> 00:09:54,961
Julia, I-I-I beg
you to rethink this.

237
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:56,429
I realize you're
angry at Avery...

238
00:09:56,862 --> 00:09:57,930
I'm not feeling anger,

239
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,432
just the peace
that comes with knowing

240
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:02,868
that Avery will be royally
screwed by me.

241
00:10:03,235 --> 00:10:05,304
There's somebody at the door.

242
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:19,018
(whispering):
It's the cleaning woman.

243
00:10:19,518 --> 00:10:22,321
I thought so. I've
hidden from her before.

244
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:25,458
Julia, there's still time to end this.

245
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:26,826
Shh...!

246
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:29,128
You know what you're doing is wrong.

247
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:32,698
You should just get out now before more harm is done.

248
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:34,000
Will you shut up?!

249
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,501
It's pointless
to hide in the closet

250
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:37,503
if people outside
can hear you.

251
00:10:37,503 --> 00:10:39,005
You're going to get caught.

252
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:40,506
Because you won't shut up.

253
00:10:40,506 --> 00:10:43,843
It's never too late to do the right thing.

254
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:45,645
No matter how low
someone else sinks

255
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:48,814
joining them there does not make things better

256
00:10:58,257 --> 00:10:59,258
(door shuts)

257
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:12,938
What was that?

258
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:14,173
What?

259
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:15,875
You kissed me.

260
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:18,110
I was trying to shut you up.

261
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:21,514
Oh, no. I've been kissed
to shut me up before.

262
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,282
This was not that.

263
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:24,550
(taps key)

264
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:27,053
Got it. All files deleted.

265
00:11:27,553 --> 00:11:30,856
You know, that didn't make me feel as good as I thought.

266
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:33,559
That's because you know
you did the wrong thing.

267
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:39,498
Ah, that's better.

268
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:46,439
Well, it doesn't look like

269
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:49,275
I'll be leaving KACL
anytime soon.

270
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,110
Coffee to go, please.

271
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:53,612
Well...
what-what happened, Roz?

272
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:55,081
Turns out the person

273
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:58,484
who's interviewing me
is a guy I've slept with

274
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:01,854
What are the odds?

275
00:12:05,424 --> 00:12:08,494
It was ten years ago at a convention in Cancun

276
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:09,495
We were all hammered.

277
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:10,796
Oh, well,

278
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:12,064
I'm surprised
you even remember him.

279
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:13,499
Well, it's hard to forget

280
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:15,501
when you wake up with
a name tag on your pillow

281
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:18,938
that says, "Hola, my
name is Woody Wiswell".

282
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:26,946
So what's the problem?

283
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,848
There's just something weird about it.

284
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:30,850
I don't know, maybe I'm just freaking myself out

285
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:33,185
because I'm not sure if
I'm ready for this job yet.

286
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:34,587
Well, of course
you are, Roz.

287
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,088
I mean, come on,
don't doubt yourself.

288
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:37,923
They're the ones
that called you, right?

289
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:39,024
Yeah.
You go down there,

290
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:40,359
you get that job.

291
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:41,794
You're going to make
a great program director.

292
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:43,195
You really think I will?

293
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:44,697
Of course I do.

294
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:49,535
Even though... I wish you
could stay with me forever.

295
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:53,506
I'm going to miss you
so much, Roz.

296
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:54,373
Oh, stop it.

297
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:56,342
I don't even
have the job yet.

298
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:57,877
You're going to jinx it.

299
00:12:57,877 --> 00:12:58,878
Thank you.

300
00:12:58,878 --> 00:13:00,746
Listen, I better go

301
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:02,047
and get my
presentation together

302
00:13:02,047 --> 00:13:03,549
so I can impress
Woody Wiswell.

303
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:06,051
Seems to me

304
00:13:06,051 --> 00:13:07,553
you've impressed him already

305
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:13,392
Hello.
Julia!

306
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:15,361
Can I have
a latte to go, please?

307
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:16,729
Listen, Julia, Julia..

308
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:18,898
I've been dying to talk to you all week about what happened

309
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:20,065
at Avery's office.

310
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,467
Obviously something is going on,

311
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:24,470
and I have
several hypotheses

312
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,472
It could be
displaced passion,

313
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,974
frustration from
a failed relationship,

314
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:30,476
or an adrenaline- induced action

315
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:33,979
as a result of the stress we
were both suffering from...

316
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:36,115
Oh, Frasier,
for once in your life,

317
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:39,084
would you
please shut up?

318
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:40,619
Oh, hi.
Hello.

319
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:43,088
Hi, guys.
Hey, Frasier.

320
00:13:43,088 --> 00:13:45,124
Hey, Fras, you look a little down.

321
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:46,091
Everything okay?

322
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:47,459
Uh, two coffees, please?

323
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:49,261
Dad, if you had
any perspicacity whatsoever,

324
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:51,263
you would know
that this expression

325
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:52,765
is merely ruminative perplexity.

326
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,067
My bad.

327
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:58,404
It's nothing serious.

328
00:13:58,404 --> 00:13:59,672
I'll work it out.

329
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,440
You know where I like
to work things out?

330
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,775
The shooting range.

331
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:05,110
Good Lord, Niles,
are you still going down there?

332
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,712
I thought you hated guns.

333
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:09,281
Oh, believe me, I never expected
I'’d like it as much as I do,

334
00:14:09,281 --> 00:14:10,783
but when you're in that booth

335
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:14,086
focused on precision
and accuracy,

336
00:14:14,086 --> 00:14:15,688
it's not dissimilar to a kind of meditation

337
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:16,789
Wouldn't you agree, Dad?

338
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:18,624
I just like to shoot stuff, son.

339
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:21,126
Fair enough.

340
00:14:21,126 --> 00:14:22,628
You should join us.

341
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:24,129
There's a great bunch of guys I shoot with.

342
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:25,598
I think you'd like them.

343
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:27,499
Well, I'm not sure I'd fit in

344
00:14:27,499 --> 00:14:29,535
with a bunch of trigger-happy
gun nuts.

345
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,036
Now don't stereotype them.

346
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:33,405
These are decent family men
who enjoy marksmanship.

347
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:34,773
It's a good
group we've got.

348
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:36,208
Dad and I are going down
this afternoon.

349
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,643
I don't think I'm going to come
today, Niles.

350
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:40,446
Well... it's Mitch's birthday.

351
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:42,781
I usually go shooting
twice a year or so,

352
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:45,584
and after this week,
I've had my fill.

353
00:14:45,584 --> 00:14:46,352
Well...
Thank you.

354
00:14:46,352 --> 00:14:47,653
I'm still going.

355
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,355
My shooting's getting better and better.

356
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:50,789
Plus, the gun show's in town

357
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:52,291
and the guys
are bringing me passes.

358
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:53,192
Mm!

359
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:55,628
A gun show?

360
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:58,130
What's next? Square dancing?

361
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:01,033
Maybe.

362
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:04,937
This country was built
by gun-toting square dancers.

363
00:15:09,174 --> 00:15:10,643
So, I really appreciate

364
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:12,578
you bringing me in
for this interview.

365
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:15,014
I've been listening
to your station for a while

366
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:17,016
and I prepared
a little presentation

367
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:22,187
Oh, that's not necessary

368
00:15:22,187 --> 00:15:24,690
I mean, this is
just a formality.

369
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:27,126
Trust me,
I know what you can do.

370
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:32,531
Really?

371
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:33,532
Yeah, I, uh...

372
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,302
I already told the guys
about you.

373
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:41,073
What exactly
did you tell them?

374
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:44,310
Well, you know,
how incredible you are.

375
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:47,613
Okay, look,
I think there's something

376
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,615
that needs to be said here.

377
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,116
Why don't we just
get it all out in open?

378
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:53,619
Yes, we slept together
in Cancun,

379
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,621
but I don't want that
to affect the job.

380
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:56,588
I mean, it was ten years ago.

381
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,524
What are you talking about?

382
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:02,027
Look, I think you have me
mistaken for someone else.

383
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:07,933
And I think I would remember
a name like Woody Wiswell.

384
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:10,936
I mean, seriously,
whose named Woody Wiswell?

385
00:16:10,936 --> 00:16:11,704
Yeah, well

386
00:16:11,904 --> 00:16:13,339
just me and my dad.

387
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:25,217
Darling, I just don't think
you need an ankle holster

388
00:16:25,217 --> 00:16:27,586
when you don't even
own a gun.

389
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,556
Well, first of all,
who says it's for me,

390
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:32,992
Miss
I-Never-Surprise-You-Anymore?

391
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:35,361
And, second of all

392
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:37,229
I'm thinking
I might own a gun soon.

393
00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:38,931
No you won't.
No, no, no

394
00:16:39,231 --> 00:16:40,299
don't worry.

395
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:42,801
I... I would keep the gun in
a locker at the shooting range.

396
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:44,770
I would never have a gun
in the same house

397
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:45,771
as your mother

398
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:50,809
Now they're saying Daisy Duke may not get here.

399
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:54,113
Hey.
Hey, how's it going, kid?

400
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:55,381
Hey...

401
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:56,615
Hey, you guys, how are you?

402
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:58,584
Listen, I want you to meet
my wife Daphne.

403
00:16:58,584 --> 00:16:59,985
Daphne, this is Red
and Wayne and Mitch.

404
00:16:59,985 --> 00:17:01,487
These are the guys
I was telling you about.

405
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:02,921
Nice to meet you.
Good to know you.

406
00:17:02,921 --> 00:17:04,423
Listen, kid.
Yeah?

407
00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:05,391
We've been talking it over

408
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:07,426
and since we get along so well
at the club,

409
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:09,928
we'd like to invite you do
wn to our compound in Idaho

410
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:11,296
for a weekend.

411
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:16,668
A compound?

412
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:18,570
It's just
like the Kennedys

413
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:23,175
That sounds smashing.

414
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:24,643
Hey, that's the spirit.
See, I told you.

415
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:26,445
Hey, look, you're
good at math, right?

416
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:27,546
Come help me guess

417
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:28,847
how many shells are in that jar

418
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:30,215
so I can win the ATV.

419
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:31,050
Oh, excuse me.

420
00:17:31,483 --> 00:17:33,018
What kind of TV?

421
00:17:33,018 --> 00:17:34,520
Nice to meet
you, ma'am

422
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,988
Oh, uh, Red, hold on sec.

423
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:37,322
Uh...

424
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:39,458
Just what kind of place
do you guys have in Idaho?

425
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,794
Run-of-the-mill compound
in the wilderness.

426
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:44,997
Free country where we live
by the true Constitution.

427
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,836
They're those militia people.

428
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:53,105
You fix this, now.

429
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:54,339
This is fun, huh?

430
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:55,374
Uh, son...

431
00:17:55,374 --> 00:17:56,875
What your
father means is

432
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:58,877
you shouldn't be friends
with these people.

433
00:17:58,877 --> 00:18:00,379
Yeah, these are not your kind of guys.

434
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:02,281
Why not?
Well, let's just go

435
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:04,183
and we'll talk about it
in the car.

436
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:05,684
Oh, I can't
believe you two.

437
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:07,186
You're always telling me
my friends

438
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:08,687
are too artsy and too snooty.

439
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:10,689
Now I finally have friends
who are regular guys

440
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:12,091
and you don't like them either

441
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,392
Well, I'm having a good time.

442
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:15,561
And I'm enjoying
being a regular guy myself.

443
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:19,098
Niles, we think they want
to overthrow the government.

444
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:22,768
That's what you say
about public television.

445
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:25,204
Now if you'll excuse me.

446
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:26,705
Hey, guys, whatcha doing?

447
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:29,975
We're chipping in for
this gas-powered generator.

448
00:18:29,975 --> 00:18:30,776
We're going to need it

449
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:32,277
when it comes time for the New World Order.

450
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:34,646
Well, that sounds great.
Excuse me just a second.

451
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:36,515
Okay, they're militia.

452
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:37,516
Go, go, go, go

453
00:18:40,018 --> 00:18:42,020
I just don't understand

454
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:44,823
how this sort of thing can happen

455
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:48,494
Don't you look at faces?

456
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,863
It was long time ago.

457
00:18:51,363 --> 00:18:52,331
It was dark.

458
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:54,233
And get off my case

459
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:55,734
because it
doesn't matter anyway.

460
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:56,735
I got the job.

461
00:18:56,735 --> 00:18:58,237
Oh, congratulations, Roz.

462
00:18:58,237 --> 00:18:59,238
I'm so proud of you.

463
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:00,239
Now can I tell you

464
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:02,574
how much I'm
going to miss you?
Yes.

465
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,911
It is going to be sad
to leave the station.

466
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:09,281
But it's not like
I'm leaving town, Frasier.

467
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:11,617
I know, I know

468
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:13,118
I'll see you.

469
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:17,623
See you, Roz.
Bye.

470
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:23,862
Julia! Julia! Julia!

471
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,197
All right.

472
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:30,102
Now, listen. You can try to avoid me all you like.

473
00:19:30,402 --> 00:19:31,737
We are going to talk
this thing out.

474
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:34,439
Fine. Fine.

475
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:36,408
Anything to get you off my back.

476
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:41,079
I was looking at you
in the closet

477
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:43,081
and thinking how you always
try to do the right thing,

478
00:19:43,081 --> 00:19:46,952
and I felt a rush of affection
for you.

479
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:50,923
Call me cynical,
but I've come to accept

480
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:53,859
that most people live by
the rule of screw or be screwed.

481
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:57,262
But to see you
and how much you care,

482
00:19:57,596 --> 00:19:59,565
and really mean it, I...

483
00:19:59,898 --> 00:20:03,802
well, it's endearing--
irritating, but endearing.

484
00:20:04,069 --> 00:20:07,139
Well, you know,
I... I am flattered,

485
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:10,142
but there are a lot of genuine
people out there.

486
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:13,645
It's just that for whatever reason-- fear, anger, hurt,

487
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:15,113
they're afraid to show it.

488
00:20:23,021 --> 00:20:24,489
Oh! It's just like
the feeling you get

489
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,491
when you see a cute teddy bear
in the store

490
00:20:26,491 --> 00:20:29,061
and you want to hug it
until its head pops off.

491
00:20:31,663 --> 00:20:35,567
Could I possibly irritate you
over dinner some night?

492
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:39,271
Well, if anyone could,
it'd be you.

493
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:42,541
Take your time,
work things out.

494
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,042
I'm not going anywhere.

495
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:46,011
I realize that you're in
 a vulnerable place right now

496
00:20:46,011 --> 00:20:47,346
and that..

497
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:49,214
Oh, I recognize that one.

498
00:20:49,214 --> 00:20:51,116
That was to shut me up.

499
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:52,517
Yeah.

500
00:20:53,986 --> 00:20:55,020
Maybe Thursday.

501
00:20:57,522 --> 00:20:59,024
