1
00:00:08,575 --> 00:00:10,076
A hell of a breakfast, Daph.
I'm stuffed.

2
00:00:10,076 --> 00:00:12,078
Thanks. Now come on,
let's do some exercise
s.

3
00:00:12,078 --> 00:00:13,580
And risk a cramp?

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,883
What kind of training
did you get?

5
00:00:17,083 --> 00:00:18,051
FRASIER:
Good morning.

6
00:00:18,052 --> 00:00:19,419
Hey, Fras.
Morning.

7
00:00:19,419 --> 00:00:20,420
Want some breakfast?

8
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:21,421
Oh, uh, no, thanks.

9
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:22,922
Coffee will be fine.

10
00:00:22,922 --> 00:00:23,923
Hi, Daph, uh, listen,

11
00:00:23,923 --> 00:00:26,192
I could use
an objective opinion.

12
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:27,961
I am running for
condo board president.

13
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:30,263
I want to know what you think
of this as a slogan:

14
00:00:30,263 --> 00:00:34,000
"Frasier Crane:
the People's Elixir."

15
00:00:36,403 --> 00:00:40,774
Okay, I'm ready
for my exercises now.

16
00:00:40,774 --> 00:00:42,275
Please, Dad, this is serious.

17
00:00:42,275 --> 00:00:43,652
I have a feeling
this could be my year.

18
00:00:44,277 --> 00:00:45,712
Don't you say that every year?

19
00:00:46,012 --> 00:00:47,080
Yes, I do, but this year

20
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,082
I'm the only one running
against the incumbent,

21
00:00:49,082 --> 00:00:50,016
which means the people
will rally

22
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:52,552
their inchoate yearnings
for change behind my banner.

23
00:00:52,952 --> 00:00:54,500
Well, you're full
of catchy slogans.

24
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,122
Frasier, don't
 get

25
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:57,624
your hopes up too high.

26
00:00:57,624 --> 00:00:59,626
I mean, name one person
on the condo board

27
00:00:59,626 --> 00:01:01,061
you haven't ticked off
at least once.

28
00:01:01,428 --> 00:01:03,496
That's just because
I have a type-A,

29
00:01:03,496 --> 00:01:05,465
hands-on, get-it-done
personality.

30
00:01:05,865 --> 00:01:08,701
Seriously, name one.

31
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:09,969
You know, Frase, you might be

32
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:12,472
the best man for the job,
but a friendly smile

33
00:01:12,472 --> 00:01:13,973
and a "How do you do?"
in the hallway

34
00:01:13,973 --> 00:01:16,476
goes a lot further than being
"the People's Laxative."

35
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:21,915
Elixir.

36
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:25,652
Well, I suppose
you're right.

37
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:30,323
I haven't really established
myself as the neighborly sort.

38
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,958
I thought that my term

39
00:01:32,158 --> 00:01:34,727
as fire safety captain
might do the trick,

40
00:01:34,727 --> 00:01:39,599
but... I guess I drilled them
once too often.

41
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:42,335
Maybe you could give him lessons
on how to be a normal person.

42
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:44,537
I beg your pardon?

43
00:01:44,904 --> 00:01:45,972
Say, I've got an idea.

44
00:01:46,473 --> 00:01:48,374
Dad, why don't you just run?

45
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:49,709
Why would I want to do that?

46
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:52,212
Well, because then the people
would get their regular guy

47
00:01:52,712 --> 00:01:55,048
but he would have
my political agenda.

48
00:01:55,348 --> 00:01:56,916
,
I get it.
Your father's the figurehead

49
00:01:56,916 --> 00:01:58,918
like Woodrow Wilson
when he had that stroke

50
00:01:58,918 --> 00:02:00,787
and his wife secretly
acted as president.

51
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,288
Yes, exactly.

52
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:03,857
But, of course, Dad would
be conscious, presumably.

53
00:02:04,357 --> 00:02:05,291
(laughs)

54
00:02:05,658 --> 00:02:07,227
How did you
know about that?

55
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:10,196
I'm studying for
 my citizenship exam.

56
00:02:10,196 --> 00:02:12,198
It's about time I became
an American like everyone else.

57
00:02:12,198 --> 00:02:16,202
y.
If you were like everyone else,
you wouldn't know any histor

58
00:02:16,202 --> 00:02:19,072
So, Dad, what do you think?

59
00:02:19,372 --> 00:02:21,741
.
I don't know...
sounds like a big pain

60
00:02:21,741 --> 00:02:22,542
Oh, come on, Dad.

61
00:02:23,042 --> 00:02:24,043
Think of the neighbors.

62
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:27,380
Think of the building,
the good we could do together.

63
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,449
We can actually achieve

64
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:32,385
the dream
of luxury apartment living

65
00:02:32,385 --> 00:02:34,420
that our founders intended.

66
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:37,290
.
Plus, I'll do all the work

67
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:39,225
I'll tell you something
I always thought we needed:

68
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:42,228
d.
wider parking spaces
so the doors don't get dinge

69
00:02:42,228 --> 00:02:43,296
All right,
you do this for me

70
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:45,198
?
I'll make sure
that gets done.
Really

71
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:47,100
Absolutely... Mr. President.

72
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:49,502
I like the sound of that.

73
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:50,904
(both laughing)

74
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:52,906
Now, I think I should
still run against you.

75
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:53,907
Why?

76
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:56,376
Well, if I drop out just as you
announce your candidacy,

77
00:02:56,743 --> 00:02:57,744
people might suspect
something's up.

78
00:02:58,244 --> 00:03:00,246
It's better that our
political legerdemain

79
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:03,316
remain sub rosa, hmm?

80
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:05,685
How would a normal person
say that, Dad?

81
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:09,088
No one needs to know
how the hot dogs are made.

82
00:03:11,224 --> 00:03:13,259
This is going to be sweet.

83
00:03:17,997 --> 00:03:19,999
Which brings me to
my final opponent...

84
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:21,367
Martin Crane.

85
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,269
Now, we're all well aware

86
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:25,271
that he is a
decorated war hero

87
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:27,407
and a much-honored police officer,

88
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:32,779
but does he have the
building's interests at heart?

89
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:35,582
Maybe.

90
00:03:36,015 --> 00:03:37,550
I simply ask that you

91
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:41,821
stack up his 45
years of experience

92
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:46,559
against my term
as fire safety captain.

93
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:48,228
Thank you...

94
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,830
and God Bless Elliot Bay Towers.

95
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,899
(light applause)

96
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:55,702
And now we'll hear
from Martin Crane.

97
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:57,237
(cheering and applause)

98
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,272
(chuckling)

99
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:02,108
Uh, thanks,
I'm Marty Crane.

100
00:04:02,108 --> 00:04:06,446
Uh, I just want to say
that it's a privilege to run

101
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:08,948
and, uh, I'll try to do
the best I can.

102
00:04:08,948 --> 00:04:12,252
Thank you, and... go Seahawks!

103
00:04:12,518 --> 00:04:14,587
(applause)

104
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:17,523
PAUL:
Here's where we'd hear from our third candidate

105
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:20,360
current president Jim McIntyre,
but, uh...

106
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:24,130
last night he informed me that
we was giving up condo board

107
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:26,132
in order to pursue his dream

108
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:28,768
of teaching English
as a second language.

109
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:33,339
Dream? Or court-ordered community service?

110
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:37,343
So, I guess it's time to vote.

111
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:38,678
Well, I wish
we would have known

112
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:39,679
that guy
wasn't going to run.

113
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:41,147
I wouldn't have had
to spend all night

114
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:42,649
working on my speech.

115
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:45,685
Yes... plus, I would
automatically be
president now.

116
00:04:46,152 --> 00:04:48,187
Yeah. Even you couldn't lose
a one-man election.

117
00:04:48,187 --> 00:04:50,890
8.
Hmm? You're forgetting 199

118
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:54,060
Oh, yeah, when you lost
to the dead guy.

119
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,129
He wasn't dead, he was in a coma.

120
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:58,998
How was I supposed
to compete with that?

121
00:04:58,998 --> 00:05:01,734
Okay, ladies and gentlemen,
we have winner

122
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:03,970
in a surprisingly

123
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:07,840
close vote of 15 to two.

124
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,176
Our new president
is Martin Crane.

125
00:05:10,176 --> 00:05:12,011
Yes!

126
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:14,013
I got two votes.

127
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:19,018
Bye-bye.

128
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:22,522
Oh... what a great massage.

129
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:25,525
It's too bad her English
wasn't better.

130
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:28,027
She could have told
us some of her secrets.

131
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:30,530
Yes, but now we know that Urdu

132
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:32,532
is the official language
of heaven.

133
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:34,400
I could go for a snack.

134
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,735
Want some pâât￩?

135
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:36,736
No, thanks

136
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:37,637
Some cheese?

137
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:38,538
No.

138
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:39,472
Pâât￩?

139
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:41,441
Again, no.

140
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:42,909
How about a salad?

141
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:44,377
Or a fruit salad?

142
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:45,878
Ooh, I could throw together
a little m￩lange.

143
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:47,380
(doorbell rings)

144
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,381
I'll get it.

145
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:50,383
A m￩lange sounds lovely.

146
00:05:52,885 --> 00:05:54,387
Roz, I thought you were going out

147
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:55,388
with that man from your gym.

148
00:05:55,888 --> 00:05:57,223
We didn't even make it
to dinner.

149
00:05:57,223 --> 00:05:59,058
Here's your never-fail
date purse back.

150
00:05:59,058 --> 00:06:00,393
Oh, I'm sorry.

151
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:02,061
No, come on in

152
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:02,862
Are you sure?

153
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:04,364
You look like
you're going to bed.

154
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,331
No, we just
got a massage.

155
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:06,766
Come in.

156
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:09,235
Oh, boy a massage
sounds wonderful.

157
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:13,239
She did the most incredible
thing to my neck.

158
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:14,774
Here, let me show you.

159
00:06:16,275 --> 00:06:17,276
Oh...

160
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:18,778
Mm-hmm.

161
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:20,279
So, how could you tell

162
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:21,781
your date wasn't meant to be?

163
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:24,684
He had the same purse.

164
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:27,587
Wow, that feels so good.

165
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:28,855
Mm-hmm

166
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:29,589
Ooh, hi, Roz.

167
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:31,023
Hi.

168
00:06:31,023 --> 00:06:32,392
Poor thing had a bad date.

169
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,260
Oh, I'm sorry.

170
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:37,096
Well, now that Daphne's helping you relax,

171
00:06:37,096 --> 00:06:40,166
you want to join us
in a little m￩lange?

172
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:49,709
What?

173
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:50,610
You'll love it.

174
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:52,612
Niles is amazing.

175
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:56,115
Wait, what are you saying?

176
00:06:56,115 --> 00:06:58,017
Unless you have
other plans.

177
00:06:58,384 --> 00:07:01,954
Well... I guess not, but...

178
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:04,390
Great.

179
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:06,793
Then here you go.

180
00:07:07,326 --> 00:07:11,197
Oh... fruit salad.

181
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:12,765
Oh, my God.

182
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:15,768
I thought you said "m￩nage."

183
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:19,305
(laughing)

184
00:07:19,305 --> 00:07:23,910
Well, the fruits
do mix a little
promiscuously.

185
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:24,811
ROZ:
I mean, I was thinking

186
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:26,612
"Oh, my God,
what are they saying?"

187
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:28,981
Rest assured we would have offered you

188
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:30,983
something more
than fruit salad

189
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:32,385
to get you
in the mood.

190
00:07:32,718 --> 00:07:34,287
You know what?

191
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:36,622
She didn't say "no."

192
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:41,961
You're right, she didn't.

193
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:45,431
It was only because it was so
weird I didn't know what to say.

194
00:07:45,431 --> 00:07:46,833
Is that why?

195
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:49,669
I think someone
has a little crush on us.

196
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:50,837
You wish.

197
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:53,039
We know what you wish.

198
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:53,840
Okay, okay, forget it.

199
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,341
Let's talk about something else.

200
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:56,776
What are you guys going to do
 this weekend?

201
00:07:56,776 --> 00:07:59,178
You, if you get your way.

202
00:07:59,178 --> 00:08:01,180
(laughing)

203
00:08:04,717 --> 00:08:06,719
So, if we had have asked you
you would have said "no"?

204
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:08,154
Of course I would have.

205
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,589
I see. And what's wrong
with us?

206
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:11,090
Do you find us
unattractive?

207
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,592
What if we wore masks?

208
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:14,093
Oh, that'd have to be
Nixon and Frankenstein.

209
00:08:14,093 --> 00:08:15,895
That's all we've got.
All right, you guys!

210
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:17,196
Stop it.

211
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:18,698
I'm sorry I didn't understand

212
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:20,199
your little code word
for fruit salad.

213
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:21,534
DAPHNE:
We're sorry.

214
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:23,870
Here you haven't even had dinner
and we're teasing you.

215
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:24,871
Oh, you haven't?
I didn't know that.

216
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:26,205
Let me make
you something.

217
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:28,040
No, it's okay.
I'm not that hungry.

218
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,342
Oh, come on.

219
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:32,945
Well, all right,
I wouldn't say no to a sandwich.

220
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,748
(both laughing)

221
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:40,753
Yes, he's doing
a hell of a job, isn't he?

222
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:41,754
Oh, listen,
what did you think

223
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:43,256
of the new plants
in the lobby?

224
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:44,757
Dad was particularly pleased

225
00:08:44,757 --> 00:08:46,759
with how they complemented
the filigree in the sconces.

226
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:50,263
Don't tell people that.

227
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:54,767
Yes, I suppose
the best man did win.

228
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:56,269
Bye-bye.

229
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:59,171
Another satisfied
constituent.

230
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:02,341
(doorbell rings)
Well, whoop-de-do.

231
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:05,144
Hello.

232
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:06,646
Frasier. Hey, Marty...

233
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:07,580
Hey, Paul.

234
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,615
I just came down
to congratulate you.

235
00:09:09,615 --> 00:09:12,151
Every president talks about
getting new dryers

236
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:14,153
but you finally
did something about it.

237
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:17,089
You see, Dad, they love what
you're doing for the building.

238
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:20,159
Of course, the sting of losing
was quite painful,

239
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:23,095
but it's worth it
if we can have a laundry room

240
00:09:23,095 --> 00:09:25,665
that can take us
into the 21st century.

241
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:29,168
You're being a good sport
about this, Frasier.

242
00:09:29,168 --> 00:09:32,171
Well, you know, public-
spiritedness is the Crane code.

243
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:33,172
Right on.

244
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:35,174
Uh, Paul, could you, uh.

245
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:36,642
Oh, sure.

246
00:09:36,642 --> 00:09:38,110
Hey, is it okay if I move
the recycling bins

247
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,612
down to the landing
at the bottom of the stairs?

248
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:41,013
Knock yourself out.

249
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:42,281
Great. Thanks.

250
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,253
Is this going to be a problem?

251
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:48,254
What?

252
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:52,158
I think we need to reach
a little understanding.

253
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:54,894
Now, if someone asks you
a question,

254
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:56,262
you look at me.

255
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:59,265
If I scratch my nose...

256
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:01,767
...it means "no."

257
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,269
You get it?

258
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:06,138
They both begin with the same
two letters-- N-O.

259
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:08,441
Now, if I

260
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:11,310
touch my eye...

261
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:16,816
it means "aye," as in "yes."

262
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:19,819
Guess what you're being
if I touch my ass.

263
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:24,290
Dad...

264
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,291
I think I can at least

265
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,293
take care of the no-brainer decisions myself.

266
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:28,794
That is not how
this is supposed to work.

267
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:30,763
Well, I thought how this
was supposed to work

268
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:32,331
was that if I agreed to do this

269
00:10:32,331 --> 00:10:34,100
you'd do the one thing
I asked for.

270
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,668
Yes, wider parking spaces.

271
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:38,170
But I have five years of ideas
here to implement first.

272
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:39,271
Five years?!

273
00:10:39,271 --> 00:10:40,840
By the time
I get my parking space

274
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,842
I'll be driving
a three-wheeled scooter

275
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:44,143
with an oxygen tank on the back.

276
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:45,978
Look, even if I could
fast-track it,

277
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:47,980
there are feasibility studies
to be done.

278
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,483
There's a committee review and
there's a bidding process.

279
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:53,252
You can't just hire some guy with a can of paint.

280
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:54,453
That's what I'd do.

281
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,990
Well, that is why
you're not in charge.

282
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:00,259
Now...

283
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:03,029
here's your agenda
for the next meeting.

284
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:05,031
Make sure that you follow it
to the letter.

285
00:11:05,464 --> 00:11:07,033
Yes, master.

286
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:08,534
Dad, I sense you

287
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:12,038
chafing under the cruel yoke
of public service.

288
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:14,507
Remember, we must subordinate
our own wishes

289
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,509
for the good of the building.

290
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:21,013
And that is not one
of our hand signals.

291
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,519
Next item, a study

292
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,822
to determine the
feasibility of putting

293
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:34,093
something on the roof.

294
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:35,061
Any volunteers?

295
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:39,065
I volunteer,
and I would like to explore

296
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:42,902
the idea of putting
a patio on the roof.

297
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:45,671
All right. Well, that
about wraps things up.

298
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:47,073
Uh, query.

299
00:11:47,073 --> 00:11:48,541
Recognized.

300
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:50,876
Wasn't there something else
you wanted to bring up?

301
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:52,244
No. Don't think so.

302
00:11:52,244 --> 00:11:53,612
Are you sure?

303
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,948
I-I could have sworn
I heard the president

304
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:58,884
say something
about a new ventilation system.

305
00:11:59,251 --> 00:12:00,319
Oh, we've done enough
for tonight.

306
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:01,287
No, you haven't!

307
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:11,230
I'm certain that if you
simply consult the agenda

308
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,232
which you
so painstakingly prepared,

309
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:16,702
you will find that there is
one last item.

310
00:12:16,702 --> 00:12:18,037
Oh, yeah.

311
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:19,305
Here it is

312
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:20,806
Wider parking spaces.

313
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:22,641
MAN:
Oh, that's good.

314
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:24,310
Real good.
Great idea.

315
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,078
Classic Marty.

316
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:30,516
No. Wider.

317
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:33,486
Those in favor
of better parking?

318
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:34,487
Aye.
Aye.
Aye.

319
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:35,888
Opposed to better parking?

320
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:37,323
Nay!
Motion carries.

321
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:38,758
Query!
Not recognized.

322
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:41,160
Marty, I'm afraid
I have to interrupt.

323
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:43,095
There's a delivery for you.

324
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:44,530
Bring it in, Mrs. Richman.

325
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:46,799
Here we go.

326
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:47,800
Whoa. A cake.

327
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,301
What's the occasion?

328
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:51,303
We wanted to show you
our appreciation

329
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:53,672
for all the great things
you've done for us.

330
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:58,310
.
Wow! I never thought
I'd see myself in frosting

331
00:12:58,544 --> 00:12:59,612
In the last couple
of weeks,

332
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,113
you've done more
for this building

333
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:03,115
than the last
two presidents combined.

334
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:05,117
Where did you get
all these great ideas?

335
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:06,118
Oh, I don't know.

336
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:07,686
They just come to me

337
00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:10,122
while I'm trying to watch TV

338
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,225
Why don't you
make yourself useful

339
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:14,493
and cut the cake, Frasier?

340
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:20,299
My pleasure, Mr. President.

341
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:42,655
Hello.

342
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:43,956
Oh, don't be sore.

343
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:46,492
I'll get to the ventilation system eventually.

344
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,294
You went back
on our agreement.

345
00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:50,629
I'm the one who's suppos
 to call the shots around here.

346
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:53,199
Our agreement was that I'd get wider parking spaces

347
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:54,600
but you blew me off.

348
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,435
As far as I'm concerned

349
00:13:56,435 --> 00:13:57,837
the agreement is over.

350
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,839
Besides, I think
I have a knack

351
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,841
for this president thing.

352
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:05,144
Now, I'd like to keep you

353
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:07,479
on my team,
but if it's too rough for you

354
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,815
just say the word.

355
00:14:09,815 --> 00:14:14,186
Well, well, well.

356
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:16,689
The puppet thinks
he's a real boy.

357
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:26,799
I don't think you have
the skills for this job.

358
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:29,902
I have something better--
people skills.

359
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:32,738
So do I, but
these boobs and nincompoops

360
00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:34,640
are too stupid to see it!

361
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,009
Well, if you're so sure you're indispensable

362
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:39,511
maybe you should
run for president.

363
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:42,982
Oh, wait. You did. Five times.

364
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:44,950
They wouldn't
love you so much

365
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:46,385
if it weren't
for my ideas!

366
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:48,387
Right, because you need a PhD

367
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,890
to think about repainting
the lobby.

368
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,324
Oh, wait. You don't.

369
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:54,226
Would you stop doing that?

370
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:55,194
You're right.

371
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,229
It's not an effective
way to argue.

372
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:59,231
Oh, wait. It is.

373
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:07,239
DAPHNE:
Don't you just love this part of American history?

374
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:09,241
I'm not much
of a Civil War buff.

375
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:11,243
Really? It's fascinating--

376
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:13,746
much more so than
the English Civil War.

377
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,681
Impossible.

378
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:18,617
Didn't you want to be there when Charles I

379
00:15:18,617 --> 00:15:21,520
unfurled his standard
at Nottingham in 1642?

380
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,922
Ugh. You sound like school.

381
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:24,456
We'll let Frasier settle it.

382
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:26,358
Which civil war
was more interesting?

383
00:15:26,358 --> 00:15:27,726
Spanish!

384
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:29,528
But I don't
have time to prove it.

385
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:31,263
I've got to go
confront Evita Peron

386
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:33,098
at the condo board
meeting tonight.

387
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:33,966
Dad?
Yes.

388
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:35,434
I thought he
was doing a good job.

389
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:36,902
Well, he was--

390
00:15:36,902 --> 00:15:38,771
until he started
to think for himself.

391
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,306
He's so damn popular

392
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:41,807
everybody else just follows along.

393
00:15:41,807 --> 00:15:43,108
It's like the blind leading the blind.

394
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:44,910
Well...
But it will not stand!

395
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,912
As soon as he calls
for new business tonight

396
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:49,415
I am going to leap to my feet
and expose him

397
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:51,417
for the power-mad dictator
that he's become.

398
00:15:51,917 --> 00:15:52,918
Mm. Mmm, mm, mm.

399
00:15:52,918 --> 00:15:56,622
Then I'll take over.

400
00:15:57,189 --> 00:15:59,024
Maybe you should
take it easy on your father.

401
00:15:59,024 --> 00:16:00,326
Why?!

402
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:01,860
Because he's getting out more,

403
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,362
having fun with other
people in the building.

404
00:16:03,862 --> 00:16:05,264
You can't take that
away from him.

405
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:06,665
You get to be a big shot
all the time.

406
00:16:06,665 --> 00:16:08,667
This is Dad's turn
in the limelight.

407
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:10,035
It's good for his self-esteem.

408
00:16:10,936 --> 00:16:13,272
I don't know why
I even talk to you people.

409
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,642
Frasier.
Not now!

410
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:19,144
Okay!

411
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:20,646
Hi. Can I join you guys?

412
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,147
Oh.

413
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:24,149
I think someone is
coming on to us.

414
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:28,988
Someone just can't
leave us alone.

415
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,422
Ok

416
00:16:30,422 --> 00:16:32,891
You guys have been doing this
for over two weeks.

417
00:16:32,891 --> 00:16:33,859
Lay off.

418
00:16:33,859 --> 00:16:35,327
I thought laying off

419
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,830
was exactly what you didn't
want us to do.

420
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,832
That's a good one.

421
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:42,634
Doesn't even make sense.

422
00:16:42,634 --> 00:16:44,336
Listen,

423
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:46,672
I don't want to have
a threesome with you.

424
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:49,675
I never wanted
to have a threesome with you,

425
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:52,144
and I will not have
a threesome with you!

426
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,580
So quit bringing it up!

427
00:16:58,283 --> 00:17:00,619
I think we went
a little too far.

428
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:02,755
Not as far as she wanted to go.

429
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,089
(both giggling)

430
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:06,091
Excuse me. Yes.

431
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:08,160
I'm sorry, I couldn't help overhearing

432
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,230
and as a fellow
nontraditional sex enthusiast--

433
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,564
our day will come.

434
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:14,333
Here's my card.

435
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:17,403
Thank you.

436
00:17:18,837 --> 00:17:20,906
Oh, and by the way,
a bunch of us get together

437
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,909
over at the SeaTac Hyatt
second Saturday of every month,

438
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:25,878
and if you want
to just tape your wife

439
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:27,980
with another dude, that's cool

440
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:42,361
Thank you, Mrs. Richman.

441
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:44,163
And for anyone
who needs reminding

442
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:50,035
these meetings start
at 8:00, not 8:07.

443
00:17:50,035 --> 00:17:51,804
Noted.

444
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:53,972
Well, shall we open the floor up to new business?

445
00:17:53,972 --> 00:17:55,307
Yes! Yes! Yes!

446
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:57,810
It's time you people
understood the real kind of...

447
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:58,811
Hold it, Crane.

448
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:00,112
I got real
business here.

449
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:02,948
Can you tell us when
we're going to be able to get

450
00:18:02,948 --> 00:18:04,917
our cars back
into the parking garage?

451
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:06,218
Oh, yeah.

452
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:07,453
The lines should get

453
00:18:07,986 --> 00:18:09,988
their second coat tomorrow,
and if it doesn't rain

454
00:18:09,988 --> 00:18:12,291
it should be dry
by the end of the week.

455
00:18:12,524 --> 00:18:14,927
Uh-huh, and in the meantime we
have to park out on the street.

456
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,762
Well, I know it's
a little inconvenient.

457
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:17,663
Inconvenient?!

458
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:18,730
I got a ticket!

459
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:20,999
Yeah. My wife got towed.

460
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,701
But after it's done,
we'll have wider parking spaces.

461
00:18:23,068 --> 00:18:24,136
If you make them wider

462
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:25,604
aren't we going
to lose some spaces?

463
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:27,873
Where are those people
supposed to go?

464
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:31,143
Um, well, uh, maybe
we could take turns.

465
00:18:31,143 --> 00:18:33,045
Take turns?!
Take turns?!

466
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:35,514
Does everybody here
need their car?

467
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:36,915
Of course we
need a car.

468
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:38,784
Have you got a copy of
the feasibility report?

469
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:40,285
Yeah, feasibility report.

470
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:41,787
Uh, yes, the, uh...
feasibility report.

471
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:43,789
You only have one piece
of paper there.

472
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:44,756
How long will it take

473
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,092
before we get them
painted back the right way?

474
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:47,993
And who's going to pay

475
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:50,596
I had to lug my groceries

476
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:51,930
three blocks!

477
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:53,365
Look, I'm sorry...

478
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:54,833
What? Did you
just hire a guy

479
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:56,335
with a can of paint?

480
00:18:56,335 --> 00:18:58,137
No.

481
00:18:58,370 --> 00:18:59,438
People, people!

482
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:02,241
If you just let him talk,
he could explain.

483
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,543
My father is currently
in negotiations

484
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:07,546
with a salvage company
to remove the old boiler room,

485
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:10,382
which would give us
the extra spaces we need.

486
00:19:10,382 --> 00:19:12,284
Where are we going
to park in the meantime?

487
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:14,353
My father has already discussed
with the building next door

488
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:16,855
sharing their parking spaces.

489
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:17,789
Isn't that right, Dad?

490
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,692
Uh... Yeah. Right.

491
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:23,996
We should have
had more faith in you.

492
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:26,431
You've had a lot
of good ideas so far.

493
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:29,501
Well, actually, I've got
something to tell you

494
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:31,236
about those good ideas.

495
00:19:31,236 --> 00:19:32,304
Dad.

496
00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:34,106
All that
good stuff...

497
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:36,175
all the stuff
you were crazy about...

498
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,643
it all came from Frasier.

499
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:39,178
From the very beginning,

500
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,180
he's been the one
running things,

501
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,682
and I think we should
give him a little credit.

502
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:47,019
Well, thank you, Dad,
that's very kind of you.

503
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,620
In fact, uh...

504
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,189
having me run
was Frasier's idea.

505
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,690
He figured that

506
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:54,193
he figured that you'd go for his policies

507
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,495
if they came from somebody else.

508
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:58,297
So this whole thing was a scam.

509
00:19:58,297 --> 00:19:59,698
Well, I wouldn't call it a scam.

510
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:01,066
It was just a fake-out

511
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:03,368
Frasier, how could you
do your father like this?

512
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:05,270
He's always wanted to be president,

513
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:08,273
but I never thought
he would stoop this low

514
00:20:08,273 --> 00:20:10,576
All right, that's enough!

515
00:20:10,576 --> 00:20:11,877
My son is the best thing

516
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:13,912
that ever happened
to this condo board,

517
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:15,881
but you guys
are too petty to see it.

518
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:17,950
Well, you people don't deserve him

519
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:21,220
and if you don't want
him, you don't get me either.

520
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,221
I resign.

521
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:23,488
Come on, Fras.

522
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:26,225
Right behind you, Dad.

523
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:28,460
Now what do we do?

524
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:31,196
Well, technically,
when the president resigns

525
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:35,901
the runner
-up takes power.

526
00:20:40,105 --> 00:20:42,474
That's right, isn't it?

527
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:44,476
Well.

528
00:20:44,476 --> 00:20:48,947
It's not the way I would hav
liked it, but bylaws are bylaws.

529
00:20:48,947 --> 00:20:50,882
So, as your president

530
00:20:50,882 --> 00:20:53,385
I would like to quote a man

531
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:56,888
who understands
the language of the people.
