1
00:00:09,542 --> 00:00:10,043
Oh, uh, get a cart.

2
00:00:10,577 --> 00:00:12,579
Oh, could you get it,
Niles, please?

3
00:00:12,579 --> 00:00:14,581
They're so small,
they make me feel

4
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:17,083
like I'm some sort
of fairy tale giant.

5
00:00:23,056 --> 00:00:24,557
Hey, any thoughts
about what to serve?

6
00:00:24,557 --> 00:00:26,059
Well, I thought
we might serve

7
00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:27,060
a house-cured gravlax

8
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,561
with crèème fraiche
and a sprig of dill.

9
00:00:29,095 --> 00:00:29,996
Oh, in other words, the usual.

10
00:00:29,996 --> 00:00:32,399
For your information, Niles,
people happen to like it.

11
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,667
Yes, people like
animated musicals.

12
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:36,736
Oh, honestly.

13
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:38,104
Frasier, look!

14
00:00:38,104 --> 00:00:39,105
Caviar.

15
00:00:39,105 --> 00:00:41,074
They haven't had any in ages.

16
00:00:41,574 --> 00:00:44,110
This is just what we need
to make our soiree soign￩e.

17
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:47,113
(chuckles)

18
00:00:47,113 --> 00:00:48,581
Good heavens.

19
00:00:48,581 --> 00:00:50,350
It's $100 an ounce.

20
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:52,118
Well, it must be mismarked.

21
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:55,588
Excuse me, is the Beluga
really $100 an ounce?

22
00:00:55,588 --> 00:00:57,991
(heavy French accent):
Yes.

23
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:00,894
Well, isn't that
rather a lot to pay?

24
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:02,328
To you, yes.

25
00:01:02,328 --> 00:01:05,398
To the fish who gave up
her life so you could spread

26
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:06,900
her unborn children
on a cracker,

27
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,802
it's not so much.

28
00:01:08,802 --> 00:01:11,171
You know, the reason

29
00:01:11,171 --> 00:01:13,973
for such high prices is the Russian Mafia.

30
00:01:13,973 --> 00:01:17,110
They control this market.

31
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:21,948
The Russian Mafia controls Robert's Gourmet Goodies?

32
00:01:21,948 --> 00:01:24,951
He means the caviar market,
you ninny.

33
00:01:25,452 --> 00:01:26,319
MAN:
Yes.

34
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:29,189
I have Beluga for sale.

35
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:31,691
Top quality,
fair price.

36
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:39,599
The name is Petyr.

37
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:42,102
I recently arrived
on my cousin's ship,

38
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:45,105
the Caspian Queen, with
beautiful Beluga caviar.

39
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:48,608
But because of those gangsters,
we cannot sell.

40
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:50,110
So I do it like this.

41
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,111
Quietly.

42
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,479
How much you want?

43
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,214
How do we know this
isn't some sort of scam?

44
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:57,617
It's no scam.

45
00:01:57,617 --> 00:02:00,487
Look inside.

46
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:06,126
You taste.

47
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:19,572
You really must
try this, Niles.

48
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:28,481
It's like being kissed
by a lusty mermaid.

49
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:29,983
(chuckles)

50
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:34,687
So, you are interested, yes?

51
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:37,023
Maybe, but how can we
be sure that you are not

52
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:38,525
Russian Mafia yourself?

53
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:41,528
Because for six generations

54
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:43,530
my family
fished the Caspian

55
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:46,432
Then ten years ago, the bastards come.

56
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:48,735
They burned
my father's boat.

57
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:52,105
They steal my mother's salt so she cannot prepare the roe.

58
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:55,408
And if they know I sell Beluga
for $40 an ounce,

59
00:02:55,408 --> 00:02:59,712
they would cut out my tongue
and pluck out my eyes!

60
00:03:01,714 --> 00:03:04,217
Did you say
$40 an ounce?

61
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,757
Shouldn'’t our caviar
be here by now?

62
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:12,258
It will be here,
Niles.

63
00:03:12,258 --> 00:03:13,660
I gave Roz
explicit instructions.

64
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,562
What if we've been swindled?

65
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:17,897
What if the tins
are filled with sand?

66
00:03:19,732 --> 00:03:20,567
Niles,

67
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:22,902
I am, as you know,

68
00:03:22,902 --> 00:03:26,406
an excellent judge of character.

69
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:32,745
And in Petyr, I saw an honest,
hard-working fisherman.

70
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:34,647
Why didn't you
have him deliver it here?

71
00:03:34,647 --> 00:03:38,484
What? I don't want him
knowing where I live.

72
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:41,854
(doorbell rings)

73
00:03:41,854 --> 00:03:44,724
The Russian bear
hunts by night.

74
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:45,925
Very funny, Roz,
come on.

75
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:46,759
Give me that.

76
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,761
All right, let's have a look

77
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:52,765
Oh.

78
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:55,768
Niles.

79
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,710
It's beautiful.

80
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:06,145
I don't get what the big
deal is about caviar.

81
00:04:06,145 --> 00:04:07,947
I had it once,
it was nothing special.

82
00:04:07,947 --> 00:04:09,782
Well, Roz, a lot of things can affect caviar.

83
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:11,117
Where did you have it?

84
00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:15,388
On a mini-bagel
at the Tucson Doubletree.

85
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:19,325
Try this.

86
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:24,130
Hmm.

87
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,131
Wow.

88
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:26,633
Mm-hmm?

89
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:27,500
That's good.
Yes.

90
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,868
That's really good.

91
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:31,371
What's your little
party for tonight?

92
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:32,372
Invited guests.

93
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:33,306
I'm sorry, Roz.

94
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:35,308
What?

95
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:36,843
Thank you
for your help.

96
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:37,877
See you later.

97
00:04:37,877 --> 00:04:38,811
Oh, hi, Roz.

98
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:39,879
Oh, hi, Dad.

99
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:41,814
Hey, hey, everybody.

100
00:04:41,814 --> 00:04:42,882
Check this out

101
00:04:42,882 --> 00:04:45,385
Just went to the ATM for $20,

102
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:48,388
as you can see from this
receipt, and it gave me $60.

103
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:50,823
I won 40 bucks.

104
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:53,359
You, you mean
the bank lost $40.

105
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:56,829
Uh, yeah, that big,
faceless bank that charges me

106
00:04:56,829 --> 00:04:59,699
$12 a month for my checking
account lost $40.

107
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:02,669
You know,
you can't keep that.

108
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:04,504
It's bad karma.

109
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:05,838
Sorry, this is America.

110
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:07,640
A land built on the principle
"Finders Keepers."

111
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,509
Oh, come on.

112
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:11,010
There's a toll-free
service number

113
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,011
right here on the receipt.

114
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:13,846
Just call them and tell
them what happened.

115
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:15,014
Why should I?

116
00:05:15,014 --> 00:05:16,849
Because otherwise,
you could end up

117
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:19,352
like my brother Nigel
and his baby teeth.

118
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,434
What happened with

119
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:36,703
your brother Nigel
and his baby teeth?

120
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:37,704
Well, like any child,

121
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:39,706
the first time he
had a tooth fall out,

122
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:41,708
he put in under his pillow at bedtime,

123
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:43,710
and sure enough,
the next morning,

124
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:46,546
he found that Winston Churchill
had left him a shiny, new coin.

125
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:47,647
Question.

126
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,115
No, Dad, we're not stopping

127
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:50,983
Go ahead,
darling.

128
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:52,418
Well, instead of being grateful,

129
00:05:52,885 --> 00:05:54,420
he got greedy
and went off to school,

130
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,888
punching people
in their mouths

131
00:05:55,888 --> 00:05:57,256
and scooping up their teeth.

132
00:05:58,991 --> 00:06:02,362
Of course, it didn't work, and he got kicked out of school,

133
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:05,298
became a thief,
and eventually went to prison.

134
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:11,104
Where he...

135
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:14,974
fittingly had all
of his teeth knocked out.

136
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:16,876
No, he lost his teeth
years earlier

137
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,244
in a rock-eating contest.

138
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:21,581
Now that's an interesting story.

139
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:24,083
We were renting a house
next to a quarry at the time...

140
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:27,086
All right, all right, I'll call the bank!

141
00:06:28,087 --> 00:06:30,590
Very kind of you
to have us here, Crane.

142
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:31,591
Yes, it's wonderful.

143
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:35,027
But then you must be used to
hosting successful parties.

144
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:36,429
Oh, not really.

145
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,732
Something's usually
on fire by now.

146
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:41,367
Oh, you're funny.

147
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:43,536
No, I'm serious.

148
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:44,937
Now, tell me.

149
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:47,940
How can we get our hands on some
of this fantastic caviar?

150
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:49,942
Well, I wish
I could tell you,

151
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:50,877
but it's, uh

152
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:53,146
a private source.

153
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:54,981
Well, perhaps I should
mention then,

154
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:57,483
that, uh, this is
for our yacht party,

155
00:06:57,483 --> 00:07:00,787
at which there just might be
room enough for another guest.

156
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:02,955
Okay, what are we talking here?

157
00:07:02,955 --> 00:07:06,592
Well, maybe five, six ounces?

158
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:09,228
Let me go see
what's in the refrigerator

159
00:07:09,228 --> 00:07:11,330
That a boy, Crane.

160
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:15,134
Niles, what are you doing?

161
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:16,169
Oh, good news.

162
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:19,005
Emile Sinclair
is crazy about the caviar.

163
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:21,374
If we sell him the rest,
he distinctly implied

164
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:23,876
he would get our squash lockers
moved further from the showers.

165
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:26,212
Isn't that fantastic?

166
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:27,547
Per-son-al.

167
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:29,048
It's, well, it would be, Niles

168
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:32,051
if the Michaelses weren't
equally enamored of it,

169
00:07:32,051 --> 00:07:34,420
and dangling an invitation
to a yacht party.

170
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:37,824
That is a pickle.

171
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:39,759
Check-ing.

172
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,661
FRASIER:
Niles?

173
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:44,664
Why don't we just call Petyr,
and order some more caviar?

174
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:47,533
That way we can satisfy both
Sinclair and the Michaels.

175
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:52,171
Cus-to-mer
Ser-vice.

176
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,141
Niles, this caviar connection

177
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,410
could really open
some doors for us.

178
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:03,382
Per-son-al!

179
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:04,417
What are you doing, Dad?

180
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:06,419
Oh, this stupid bank's
automatic voice system,

181
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:07,887
it's like a maze!

182
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:09,422
All right,
give it here.

183
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:11,924
You just push "O"

184
00:08:11,924 --> 00:08:13,926
and you'll get
an operator.

185
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:16,829
It's a little trick
I learned.

186
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,731
Another menu.

187
00:08:18,731 --> 00:08:21,734
Sometimes it's a star.

188
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:28,741
All right, maybe "1"
will get me back to a main menu.

189
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:29,709
Ah.

190
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:30,743
Here you are.

191
00:08:30,743 --> 00:08:32,245
Got me to
the right department?

192
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:34,747
No, but if I remember my
high school Spanish correctly,

193
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:37,250
you just qualified
for a small business loan.

194
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:42,188
Hi, can I help you?

195
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,223
Yes, um, I was at one
of your ATMs yesterday,

196
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:47,260
and it gave me back more than it
should have, so I want...

197
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,761
Okay, for that you'’re
going to need to complete

198
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:50,763
an ATM trouble report,
and then take it

199
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:52,732
to our operations officer
at the desk over there.

200
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:56,002
You mean I have to fill this out
before I can give you 40 bucks?

201
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:57,169
Yes, sir.

202
00:08:57,169 --> 00:08:59,305
But your sign says,
"Making banking simpler."

203
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:00,072
Yes, sir.

204
00:09:00,072 --> 00:09:01,541
Well, this isn't simpler

205
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,875
it's more complicated.

206
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,144
Yes, sir, it is.

207
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:08,581
Oh, forget it.

208
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:13,853
I knew this was going to be more
trouble than it was worth.

209
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:16,155
A little paperwork's
a small price to pay

210
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:17,156
for a clear conscience.

211
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:18,658
Yeah, meanwhil
e, I'm out 40 bucks.

212
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:20,660
It's not your money.

213
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,764
Can I help you?

214
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:27,600
Yes, uh, I had some trouble
with one of your ATMs.

215
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,602
Oh, I can't help you.

216
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:32,104
I need a manager.

217
00:09:32,104 --> 00:09:33,606
I'm proud of you.

218
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:36,375
Trust me, when this is over,
you'll feel better.

219
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:38,177
You really think so?

220
00:09:38,177 --> 00:09:39,178
I'm sure of it.

221
00:09:39,178 --> 00:09:40,680
Ah, maybe you're right.

222
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,181
Maybe I will feel better.

223
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:44,183
And if you're right
about that karma stuff

224
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:46,686
I got a good thing coming to me.

225
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:48,187
Uh-oh.

226
00:09:48,187 --> 00:09:51,190
How much money did you
put in the meter?

227
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:55,061
Oh, son of a bitch

228
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:57,930
Hi, Mr. Crane, I'm Bree, Todd's manager.

229
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:01,934
I wanted t apologize for
the trouble you had with our ATM.

230
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:04,437
And make sure that you got your $40

231
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:05,938
What? Uh, oh, no, no,

232
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:08,341
you don't need
to give anything to me.

233
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:10,710
You see, the machine
accidentally gave me $60

234
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,678
instead of $20, so I need
to give you $40.

235
00:10:12,678 --> 00:10:14,547
So, you want to
put this in your account?

236
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:15,481
No, no, no.

237
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:17,984
I want you to take it,
plus this $40,

238
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:20,820
and put it back
wherever it came from.

239
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,155
Well, I'm afraid I've already done the paperwork.

240
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:24,657
Now you'll have to speak
with our branch manager,

241
00:10:25,157 --> 00:10:26,025
but he's out of town.

242
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:28,361
This is ridiculous.

243
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:29,795
I'm sorry.

244
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:31,797
Although, there is
one other possibility.

245
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:33,165
Let me try something.

246
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:34,500
Thank you.

247
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,836
Don'’’t mention it.

248
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:39,672
Per-son-al

249
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:46,178
Sandoval, four ounces.
Right.

250
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:49,148
Smoot, five ounces.
Right.

251
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:51,083
McBean, ten ounces.

252
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,051
Ten?

253
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:53,552
Yes, I know it's a lot,

254
00:10:53,552 --> 00:10:55,554
but he promised me the use
of his Sonoma estate.

255
00:10:55,554 --> 00:10:56,522
Yes, well,
for ten, he should

256
00:10:56,522 --> 00:10:58,491
You know, for eight,
the Ashworths gave me

257
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,426
the use of their box at
the opera's opening night gala

258
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:02,828
But that's the same weeken
d as the Black and White ball.

259
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:03,763
When are we going to sleep?

260
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:05,197
Good Heavens.

261
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:10,169
Sleep is for people without social lives.

262
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,103
(laughs)

263
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:14,407
So, boys,
where's my cut?

264
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:15,675
Oh, what are you talking about?

265
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,510
I promised her a cut.

266
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,378
You see, I was so busy
at work taking orders

267
00:11:19,378 --> 00:11:20,346
that I needed her help.

268
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,181
ROZ:
You know what
it's really good on?

269
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:23,549
Scrambled eggs.

270
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:24,550
And pizza.

271
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:26,052
And potato skins...

272
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:27,520
Yes, Roz, welcome to caviar.

273
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,489
At work, during the show,
I'm just sitting there thinking

274
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:32,458
"Two hours to caviar."

275
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:34,460
"One hour to caviar."

276
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:37,763
You don't have any on you, do you?

277
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,032
Uh, no, no.

278
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:41,300
We're expecting
some momentarily.

279
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,568
Cool.

280
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:47,073
You think it'd be good
on a cheese Danish?

281
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:48,574
I think it would.

282
00:11:48,574 --> 00:11:49,575
I'm getting one.

283
00:11:51,977 --> 00:11:54,380
Gentlemen.
Oh, Petyr, hello.

284
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,882
Yes, hello,
but I am afraid also good-bye.

285
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,385
Hmm? What?
What do you
mean good-bye?

286
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:00,886
All these orders
I fill for you.

287
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:02,221
It draws too much attention.

288
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:03,556
It's too risky for me.

289
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:04,824
What are you saying?

290
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:06,459
That, that there's no more caviar?

291
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:08,360
This is my last delivery.

292
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,096
But this isn't
nearly enough.

293
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:11,964
We've made commitments
to some very powerful people.

294
00:12:11,964 --> 00:12:14,300
If we disappoint them, there's no telling what they might do.

295
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,134
They will break legs?

296
00:12:15,634 --> 00:12:16,469
Cut off thumbs?

297
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:18,170
Worse, there'll be gossip.

298
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:21,507
Petyr, please,
just one more delivery.

299
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:23,442
I cannot, the danger
is too great.

300
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:25,344
Petyr!

301
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:29,348
Dear God.

302
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:30,850
We're ruined, Niles.

303
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:31,851
We owe people all over town.

304
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:33,152
I know.

305
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:34,954
Is some of that mine? Can I have it now?

306
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:36,422
Roz, Roz,
I'm terribly sorry.

307
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,858
It seems our supplier
is going out of business,

308
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:41,227
and every ounce
of this is spoken for.

309
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:43,028
Well, that's too bad.

310
00:12:43,028 --> 00:12:44,430
Oh, well, whatever

311
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,931
I was thinking
of giving it up anyway

312
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:46,932
Too much salt.

313
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:47,933
Yes, good girl.

314
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:49,301
All right, Niles,
we can't panic.

315
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:50,636
I think I
have a plan.

316
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:51,637
I like it.

317
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:54,140
We may have to
bite the bullet

318
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,574
and buy retail

319
00:12:55,574 --> 00:12:57,476
Petyr's stuff
is much better quality.

320
00:12:57,476 --> 00:12:58,944
Our friends will
notice the difference.

321
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:00,946
Not if we cut it with what's left of the good stuff.

322
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:01,947
How much is there?

323
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:03,949
There's... Roz!

324
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,452
Oh, dear God!

325
00:13:09,588 --> 00:13:11,123
This is going
to cost us a fortune.

326
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:12,658
What else can we do?

327
00:13:12,658 --> 00:13:14,160
Uh, excuse me.

328
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,662
Would you happen to know
where we can get...

329
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:20,166
five pounds
of Beluga caviar?

330
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:23,669
There'’s not that much Beluga in all of Seattle.

331
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:24,670
Thank you.

332
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:27,173
What are we
going to do?

333
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:29,175
All right, just give me a chance to think, Niles.

334
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:30,676
Ah...

335
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:35,014
What was the name of the boat--

336
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:36,849
H.M.S.Bounty.

337
00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:43,856
This isn't Trivial Pursuit!

338
00:13:44,356 --> 00:13:45,157
Let me finish!

339
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:50,429
What was the n
ame of the boat

340
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:52,765
that Petyr
said he sailed on?

341
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:54,166
Caspian Queen.

342
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,635
Niles,

343
00:13:56,635 --> 00:13:58,571
if we can find that boat,

344
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:02,575
perhaps we can get enough
caviar to solve our problem.

345
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:07,179
Roz.

346
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:10,115
Hey, what are
you guys doing here?

347
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:13,619
I think the question is,
what are you doing here?

348
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:16,055
You know, shopping...
for stuff.

349
00:14:16,555 --> 00:14:19,558
u?
You're looking for
more caviar, aren't yo

350
00:14:19,558 --> 00:14:22,061
Of course, I am,
you took all mine!

351
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:23,829
That was ours!

352
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:26,432
You know, Roz, I think
you may have a little problem.

353
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:27,800
You're the one
with the problem.

354
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:28,801
Not me.

355
00:14:29,301 --> 00:14:30,302
This is all
your fault.

356
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:31,303
You made me try it.

357
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:32,304
Now I crave it!

358
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:33,606
I really hate you!

359
00:14:35,941 --> 00:14:36,408
Now, Roz...

360
00:14:36,942 --> 00:14:39,945
you know you don'’’t mean that

361
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:41,413
Now, come on.

362
00:14:41,413 --> 00:14:42,915
Listen, it's just possible

363
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:46,418
that we may be able to get
some more from our old supplier.

364
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:47,419
Is that true?
Yes.

365
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:48,420
Is he right?

366
00:14:48,921 --> 00:14:49,922
I'm sorry I said
I hate you.

367
00:14:50,422 --> 00:14:52,424
Roz, Roz, it's all right.
Are you going to get it today?

368
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:53,926
I love you!

369
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:01,433
(phone ringing)

370
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:02,701
Oh, shoot.

371
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,937
(doorbell chimes)

372
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:05,905
(phone ringing)

373
00:15:09,341 --> 00:15:10,342
Hello.

374
00:15:10,342 --> 00:15:12,778
Ah, no, I'm sorry,
Frasier isn't here.

375
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,347
Sure, you can place an order.

376
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:19,351
Yes, let me transfer you
to that department.

377
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:23,355
Hi, Daph. Hello.

378
00:15:23,355 --> 00:15:25,257
The postman gave me
your mail.

379
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:26,258
Oh, thanks.

380
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:27,760
You ready
to get stretched?

381
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,162
Oh, you mean we're
working out today?

382
00:15:30,162 --> 00:15:31,497
We work out every day.

383
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,499
Yeah, yeah, I know.

384
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:35,501
Oh, postcard from the bank.

385
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:38,971
Uh, "Dear Mr. Crane, we
apologize for the inconvenience.

386
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:42,474
"We have evaluated your request

387
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:45,811
and credited your account $80"!

388
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,850
There's no spaces.

389
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:53,319
I parked your car
in a loading zone.

390
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:55,287
No, no, no, just pull around front and wait for me.

391
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:56,188
This won't take long.

392
00:15:56,188 --> 00:15:57,489
You're sure?
Yes.

393
00:15:57,489 --> 00:15:58,824
And you better
get back to the car

394
00:15:58,824 --> 00:15:59,792
before Eddie
starts to panic.

395
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:04,229
Hi, how can I help you
make banking simpler?

396
00:16:04,663 --> 00:16:06,632
I'll tell you how you can help me.

397
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:09,068
I'm going to talk
and you're going to listen,

398
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:10,903
and you're going to do exactly as I ask.

399
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:13,672
I think I should
go get a manager.

400
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:14,506
No, no managers.

401
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:16,308
But our policy is...

402
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,711
Now this is real simple,
and I know you can handle it.

403
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:20,179
Now what I want you to do is--

404
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:22,214
GUARD:
Hold it right there, Mister!

405
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:30,489
Mr. Crane, as the president of
the bank, I want to assure you

406
00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:32,157
that it is not our policy

407
00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:35,494
to draw firearms on customers
trying to make a deposit.

408
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:40,666
It wasn't a deposit.

409
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:46,438
Now, I'm sure that neither of us wants to turn this

410
00:16:46,438 --> 00:16:48,340
into a protracted legal battle,

411
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:52,044
so if you would simply sign this non-disclosure agreement

412
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:56,215
here, here, here..

413
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:57,716
and here.

414
00:16:57,716 --> 00:17:01,720
Our attorneys have authorized me
to compensate you

415
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:05,124
for your troubles
in the amount of $10,000,

416
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:08,027
which can be credited to your account.

417
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,397
Ten grand?

418
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:14,566
Plus, the $40
from our original mistake.

419
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,038
Oh, what the hell.

420
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,507
I just want
to get it over with.

421
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:23,409
That's wonderful.

422
00:17:23,742 --> 00:17:26,145
Now, is there anything else I can do for you?

423
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:29,481
Could I open
an account?

424
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:36,989
FRASIER:
Ahoy!

425
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:42,995
Ahoy!

426
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:45,931
Is anyone here?

427
00:17:45,931 --> 00:17:47,766
Oh, hello.

428
00:17:47,766 --> 00:17:50,769
I'm Dr. Frasier Crane.

429
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:54,239
And, uh, this
is my brother,

430
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:55,741
Dr. Niles Crane.

431
00:17:57,509 --> 00:18:00,179
We're interested in
purchasing some Beluga caviar.

432
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:03,415
This is not a shop.
I have nothing for sale.

433
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:04,249
See?
Let's go.

434
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:05,717
No, no, no,
Niles, Niles...

435
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:08,187
This is how
the game is played.

436
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:10,689
Maybe he thinks
we're Russian Mafia.

437
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:11,657
Oh, yes.

438
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:15,594
People make that mistake
about us all the time.

439
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:20,499
Petyr gave us
this card,

440
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:22,801
and told us that this
was his cousin's boat.

441
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:25,704
Are you sure
you can't help us?

442
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:28,107
(speaking Russian)

443
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:33,512
(laughing)

444
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:35,481
How much do you need?

445
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,383
Five pounds.

446
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,220
(speaking Russian)

447
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:47,659
$80 an ounce.

448
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,662
Well, we were paying $40.

449
00:18:50,662 --> 00:18:52,498
And now you pay $80.

450
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:53,765
$50.

451
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:54,666
$80.

452
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,034
$60.
$80.

453
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:58,637
I don't think you're
doing this right.

454
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:00,906
$70, that's my
final offer.

455
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:02,407
$80.
Done!

456
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:07,412
I want to taste it first.

457
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:13,352
Go ahead.

458
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:23,195
That's the stuff.

459
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:25,030
That's enough to take
care of everyone

460
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,031
and still go out on top!

461
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:28,033
Yes, all right,
here's your money.

462
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:29,535
Pleasure doing
business with you.

463
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:32,037
MAN (over PA):
Stop where you are!
U.S. Customs!

464
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:33,038
U.S. Customs!

465
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:34,039
U.S. Customs.
Oh, my God!

466
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:35,541
Frasier, we have to get rid ofit.

467
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:36,542
Oh, dear God!

468
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:37,409
Oh, dear God!

469
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:38,377
Oh, dear God!
Oh, dear God!

470
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,212
All right, all right,
we have to hide it!

471
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:41,613
No, Niles, you can't hide it!

472
00:19:41,613 --> 00:19:43,549
They're U.S. Customs!
That's what they do!

473
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:45,117
They find things on ships!

474
00:19:46,618 --> 00:19:47,953
I know one way
to get rid of it.

475
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:59,064
Can I get you
a toast point?

476
00:19:59,064 --> 00:20:00,899
Oh, here, for God's sakes!

477
00:20:09,741 --> 00:20:11,510
What the hell's
all this?

478
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:17,583
It's not ours, we found it.

479
00:20:17,816 --> 00:20:18,884
What, the caviar?

480
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:21,253
Is that what this is?

481
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:22,654
Relax, we don't care about that.

482
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:24,656
We're looking for
a couple of Russians

483
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:26,024
who've been smuggling DVDs

484
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:36,168
My heart is pounding.

485
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:40,138
I was afraid we were
going to get arrested.

486
00:20:40,138 --> 00:20:42,074
What have we become?

487
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,375
I don't know.

488
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:46,678
We got caught up
in a nefarious scheme.

489
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:48,180
And for what?

490
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:51,116
A visit to
a wine country estate?

491
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,819
A box at the opera?

492
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:55,587
Dinner at
the Governor's Mansion?

493
00:20:58,824 --> 00:21:00,359
How much of this do you
think we can salvage?

494
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:02,361
I don't know,
just start scraping.
