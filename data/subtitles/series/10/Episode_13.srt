1
00:00:08,074 --> 00:00:10,076
Which not only helps
in the healing process,

2
00:00:10,076 --> 00:00:13,580
but also provides one with
the confidence to go forward

3
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:17,017
in spite of the fear this kind
of trauma can cause.

4
00:00:17,384 --> 00:00:18,451
Honestly, I can't say enough

5
00:00:18,918 --> 00:00:20,854
about these new medicated
bandage strips.

6
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:23,690
But thanks for asking, Jordan.

7
00:00:24,057 --> 00:00:29,062
Up next is the stock market
report with Julia Wilcox.

8
00:00:29,462 --> 00:00:30,530
(knocking)

9
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,532
Hello, Avery. Impeccable timing.

10
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:33,533
Good to see you, Frasier.

11
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:34,534
Yes, hello.

12
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:35,735
Ooh, careful, careful, careful.

13
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:37,570
Paper cut.

14
00:00:38,004 --> 00:00:40,407
Yes, I caught the last half hour
of your show.

15
00:00:40,807 --> 00:00:42,375
Oh, Roz, come and meet an old friend of mine-
-

16
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:43,877
Avery McManus.

17
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:45,211
This is Roz Doyle, my producer.

18
00:00:45,478 --> 00:00:46,346
Lovely to meet you.

19
00:00:46,646 --> 00:00:47,614
Same here.

20
00:00:48,014 --> 00:00:49,082
Avery and I used to live

21
00:00:49,082 --> 00:00:50,583
across the hall from each other
back at Oxford.

22
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:51,551
Now he lives in Seattle.

23
00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:53,086
A very accomplished accountant

24
00:00:53,086 --> 00:00:54,387
who's going to take me on as a client.

25
00:00:54,587 --> 00:00:57,657
Well, my taxes could
use some serious doing.

26
00:00:57,657 --> 00:00:58,658
FRASIER:
Roz, he's married.

27
00:00:59,092 --> 00:01:00,093
I'll tell you what:

28
00:01:00,593 --> 00:01:02,595
I'll be back in about an hour
go over this month's "Best Of."

29
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:04,164
Oh, I don't think an hour

30
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:05,465
is going to be
long enough, Frasier.

31
00:01:05,698 --> 00:01:07,267
Your finances are a mess.

32
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:09,102
Your spending's out of control
.

33
00:01:09,335 --> 00:01:10,403
Well, that's impossible.

34
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:11,704
I'm very prudent.

35
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:15,975
Then what about this $9,000
caviar bill for last month?

36
00:01:15,975 --> 00:01:17,477
And what's with you
and wine?

37
00:01:17,477 --> 00:01:18,978
I had to take on an associate

38
00:01:18,978 --> 00:01:20,980
just to go through
your sherry receipts.

39
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:21,981
And then...
Gosh, you know

40
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:23,483
I've completely forgotten myself.

41
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,452
How is Amanda?

42
00:01:25,452 --> 00:01:26,920
I don't believe I've seen
her since the wedding.

43
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:28,321
Amanda's great.
She made partner.

44
00:01:28,688 --> 00:01:29,522
Oh.

45
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:31,291
Okay, everybody,

46
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:33,193
I'm a Pathetic Loser Show
is over.

47
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,628
My listeners
are not pathetic losers.

48
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:38,631
I wasn't referring to your listeners.

49
00:01:38,631 --> 00:01:39,632
You're Julia Wilcox.

50
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:41,401
Yes, I am.

51
00:01:41,634 --> 00:01:44,104
You wrote,Practical
Applications of Econometrics.

52
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:45,505
Yes, I did.

53
00:01:45,505 --> 00:01:47,307
I love that book.

54
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:48,475
Avery McManus.

55
00:01:48,908 --> 00:01:50,477
Oh, it's a pleasure to meet a fan, Avery.

56
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:55,281
A fan is someone
who enjoys your work.

57
00:01:55,548 --> 00:01:57,117
Yes. And do you know
what they call someone

58
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:58,518
who can't stand your work?

59
00:01:58,885 --> 00:02:00,954
In your case, the public.

60
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:03,690
She was supposed
to say "what?"

61
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:05,725
And I was going to say "me."

62
00:02:05,725 --> 00:02:08,228
Oh, come on, let's get out of here.

63
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:13,900
Ow! How come you
only rub where it hurts?

64
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:16,669
Your sons hired me to torture
you, so that's what I'm doing.

65
00:02:16,936 --> 00:02:18,338
Ow! Oh, Eddie,

66
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:21,007
Daddy's in trouble.
Sic her.

67
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:26,412
Okay, all done, old man.

68
00:02:26,412 --> 00:02:28,915
And I hope you got your griping out
of your system

69
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:30,416
because I need you to be

70
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:32,218
on your best
behavior next time
Why?

71
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:35,021
Because the agency
won't assign me any new clients

72
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:37,357
until an evaluator
observes me at work.

73
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:42,195
Oh, geez, I don't want to go on
display like some trained seal.

74
00:02:42,195 --> 00:02:43,062
Please?

75
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:45,298
I'll give you some treats.

76
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:48,701
Treats, huh?

77
00:02:48,701 --> 00:02:49,969
Okay.

78
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:54,140
Hey, Fras. How was your trip to the accountant?

79
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:56,042
Fine.

80
00:02:56,042 --> 00:02:59,379
Fine. Uh... why are all these
lights on?

81
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,186
All right,
I'll be honest with you.

82
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:09,556
Avery had some very stern
warnings for me.

83
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:12,392
The situation isn't dire, but it...

84
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:14,727
it could become serious
if I don't change my ways.

85
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:16,196
Well, that doesn't sound
too tough.

86
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:18,965
You could get balcony seats
at the opera.

87
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:20,567
And stop throwing away
your change.

88
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:23,036
Oh, that was one time.

89
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:25,538
And if you had seen
that cashier's fingernails

90
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:26,539
you'd have done the same thing

91
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,542
All right, the point is, I just
have to come up with a plan.

92
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:31,044
A plan...
Perhaps a ruminative latte

93
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:35,081
What? You just had a whole new
espresso machin

94
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:36,683
shipped here from Italy.

95
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:38,685
Yes, well,
I'm waiting for the cups

96
00:03:39,018 --> 00:03:42,055
Besides, Nervosa is more to me
than just a place for coffee.

97
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,924
It's my refuge, my... my
sanctuary for contemplation.

98
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,293
Oh... oh... I've just had a cost-saving idea.

99
00:03:47,293 --> 00:03:48,261
Daphne, you're family now,

100
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:50,763
and yet I still pay you
full-price for Dad's therapy

101
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:53,933
All right, I'll keep thinking. Off I go.

102
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:59,906
This happens every time
you hire a new accountant.

103
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:01,374
You let their fear
get to you.

104
00:04:01,774 --> 00:04:04,344
But remember, it's Avery's job
to worry about your finances,

105
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:05,345
not yours.

106
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:07,847
Yes, of course it
is, of course it is.

107
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:08,848
He's the professional.

108
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:10,283
Thanks so much, Niles.

109
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:11,784
That's really quite helpful.

110
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:12,719
I feel better now.

111
00:04:13,052 --> 00:04:15,622
Excuse me, change my
shortbread order

112
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:17,624
to a tarte tatin.

113
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:20,627
And one for my
brother, please;
a la mode.

114
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:21,628
He's back.

115
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:23,496
(amplified guitar plays)

116
00:04:23,796 --> 00:04:26,165
You ready for so
me more music, Seattle?

117
00:04:26,165 --> 00:04:27,467
(cheers and applause)

118
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:28,368
Great.

119
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:32,772
(music stops)

120
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:34,274
(all groan)

121
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:37,277
I quite agree.

122
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,212
I am sorry, young man.

123
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:40,680
If we wanted to hear
your music,

124
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,648
we would attend
one of your concerts

125
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:44,050
in the bus station.

126
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:45,485
Well, people seem to like it.

127
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:46,819
Here they clap along,

128
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:48,154
and it's been enough

129
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:50,156
to keep me out of
the three-piece-cage.

130
00:04:50,156 --> 00:04:51,157
The what?

131
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:53,826
The suit, man, the suit.

132
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:55,128
Excuse me, is there a problem?

133
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,496
Well, yes, as a matt
er of fact there is.

134
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:57,997
This man is making
it impossible for me

135
00:04:57,997 --> 00:04:59,332
to converse with my brother.

136
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:01,034
I think he's great.

137
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:02,402
Ah...

138
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:03,836
I understand.

139
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:05,338
You two are friends.

140
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:08,841
Perhaps you used to gig together
in your salad days.

141
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:10,777
But, if you wish to alter

142
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:11,678
the atmosphere of this cafe,

143
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:13,579
I suggest you consult
with the owner.

144
00:05:13,946 --> 00:05:15,448
I am the owner.
Oh, really?

145
00:05:15,848 --> 00:05:17,283
Well, I'm Frasier Crane.
It's a pleasure.

146
00:05:17,283 --> 00:05:19,452
Maureen Nervosa.

147
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:21,220
Really?

148
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,655
Well, I happen to be

149
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:25,091
one of your core
customers, Miss Nervosa.

150
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:27,593
In fact, I spend over $3,000 a year here

151
00:05:27,593 --> 00:05:29,028
Which I just found out today.

152
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:30,496
NILES:
Frasier...

153
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:31,998
people are starting to stare.

154
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,499
Let's just come back
tomorrow afternoon

155
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:35,001
when the cafe's quieter.

156
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,003
Actually, Ben will be playing afternoons from now on

157
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,872
Really? Well, you know,
I... I would think about that.

158
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:42,642
I mean, although we do adore
your establishment,

159
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:44,877
if there is one thing we can find in Seattle

160
00:05:45,144 --> 00:05:46,212
it is another coffee shop.

161
00:05:46,212 --> 00:05:47,714
Yeah, but
not many of them

162
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:50,183
will let you change in the men's room.

163
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:51,918
Now, I don't relish

164
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,252
the idea of asking you this,

165
00:05:53,252 --> 00:05:54,687
but I'm afraid
you will have to choose...

166
00:05:55,054 --> 00:05:57,423
I choose Ben.

167
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:01,227
I see.

168
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:04,063
Well...

169
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,399
Farewell, Nervosa.

170
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:09,202
It's been a splendid decade,

171
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:12,538
but I'm afraid your
brew has become a bit too bold

172
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:13,539
for my brother and me.

173
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,308
Come, Niles, let's go.

174
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:16,976
But I don't want to go.

175
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:20,947
Nervosa is my haven,
my cocoon.

176
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:23,816
BEN:
This next one's called
"The Wild Rover."

177
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:25,651
(strums guitar)

178
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:27,120

186
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:52,812
My name is Frasier.

187
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:54,814
This is my brother Niles.

188
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:59,118
We're thinking of making this our regular haunt.

189
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:01,421
Way to go.

190
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:05,425
We'll have two
espressos, please.

191
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:06,759
I'm sorry,
and your name is?

192
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:07,627
Steve.

193
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:08,995
Steven. Outstanding.

194
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:11,364
Just Steve.

195
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:13,766
Steve.

196
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:18,771
I look forward to years
of this sort of lively banter

197
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:28,047
They found a way to bring
the charm of an airport

198
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:30,049
to a midtown location.

199
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:32,051
Now, Niles, let's try to be positive

200
00:07:32,051 --> 00:07:33,319
This may be our new home.

201
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:38,124
Yes. This will do nicely.

202
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:42,128
This will be
our regular table.

203
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:46,632
And that will be our
backup regular table.

204
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:51,838
Oh, perhaps
we should keep looking.

205
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:53,105
Hello, Julia.

206
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,341
Hello, Frasier.

207
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:57,877
Wow. Who's this,
your stunt double?

208
00:07:58,277 --> 00:07:59,846
This is my brother Niles.

209
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:02,849
Niles, I'd like you to meet my colleague Julia Wilcox.

210
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:04,517
How do you do?

211
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:05,585
Oh, that's very good, Frasier.

212
00:08:06,085 --> 00:08:07,386
I didn't even see
your lips move.

213
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,690
So I thought you always
go to Nervosa.

214
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,191
Well, sadly, no more.

215
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:14,694
They've hired a terribly annoying folksinger,

216
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:16,195
whose hideous noisemaking

217
00:08:16,195 --> 00:08:19,532
has made it impossible for
 me to enjoy my one sanctuary.

218
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:21,801
I didn't ask
for your life story.

219
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:25,605
Steve, I'm afraid we'll taking these to go, thank you.

220
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:26,873
Glad to hear it.

221
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:27,874
Good-bye, Frasier.

222
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:29,942
Good-bye, Emergency Frasier.

223
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:33,846
I don't like her.

224
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,715
I don't like
her cafe anymore.

225
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:37,717
Let's go.
Ah, thank you, Steve.

226
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,218
I'm sorry to
 have to tell you this,

227
00:08:39,218 --> 00:08:40,720
but I'm afraid
my brother and I

228
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,221
will not be the
everyday stalwarts

229
00:08:42,221 --> 00:08:43,189
I'd predicted we'd be.

230
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:45,124
Damn.

231
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:48,628
Every time I open my heart

232
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:24,697
You know, Avery was
always a bit of a playboy.

233
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:26,699
But, honestly, I thought
marriage would settle him down.

234
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:29,468
I should just tell Julia
that he's married.

235
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:31,237
Then again,
she's been so rude to me

236
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:33,239
Why should I do something
nice for her?

237
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,241
But, then again,
can I just stand idly by

238
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,208
and keep my mouth shut?

239
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:38,477
I can answer that one.

240
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:41,581
Doesn't he wear a ring?
No.

241
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,416
But I know he has one.

242
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,917
I was at the wedding.

243
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:47,420
Dad, you see I'm facing
a perplexing dilemma here.

244
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,754
Some guidance would be welcome.

245
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:50,089
No, it wouldn't.

246
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:53,092
You always ask for my opinion
and then completely ignore it.

247
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,595
Well, this time,
while I've got the floor

248
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:58,598
I'm going to talk about
what I want to talk about:

249
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,100
NBA referees need to enforce
the traveling rule.

250
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:04,937
It's dribble, one step, shoot.

251
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:07,940
Not dribble, step,
step, step, step, shoot.

252
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,408
Thank you.

253
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:12,845
That was very helpful.

254
00:10:12,845 --> 00:10:16,782
I guess I'll just
do what I always do:

255
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:19,285
sort through this myself.

256
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:22,054
All right, I'm off to Nervosa.

257
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:29,996
No, I'm off to that other place where young Steve works.

258
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:31,998
that's Avery and Julia's place.

259
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:33,499
Well, I hope you're
both satisfied.

260
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:35,901
Now I don't know
where the hell I'm going

261
00:10:39,271 --> 00:10:41,774
I'm hashing over an ethical dilemma

262
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:44,510
so I think I could use some black coffee.

263
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:46,679
What size would you like?

264
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:49,448
Um... I've got a lot to ponder, so I think a large.

265
00:10:49,448 --> 00:10:51,884
I'm afraid
we don't have large, sir

266
00:10:51,884 --> 00:10:55,330
We have piccolo, macho,
mucho, and mucho macho.

267
00:10:58,557 --> 00:10:59,892
I see. Uh...

268
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:03,896
Do you happen to know what size

269
00:11:03,896 --> 00:11:06,666
would correspond
to a Nervosa grande?

270
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:09,969
No. But our mucho is about
the same as the semi-colossal

271
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:11,971
over at Don't Spill The Beans.

272
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:12,838
Ah, ah...

273
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:15,708
all right,
I know that their colossal

274
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:17,710
is comparable
to a Nervosa grande,

275
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:21,981
so the semi-colossal would be
three-quarters of a colossal.

276
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:24,050
So the...

277
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,819
mucho and the semi-colossal
would be equivalent,

278
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:29,088
so I should have
the mucho macho.

279
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:32,658
But only fill it five-eighths.

280
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:33,926
Yes, sir.

281
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:35,895
For 50 cents extra,
we can pre-heat the vessel.

282
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:38,397
No. Can we just move this along,
please?

283
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:39,865
I understand completely.

284
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:43,302
Your zip code, sir?

285
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:46,872
(whispering):
You don't have to give your real zip if you don't want to.

286
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:49,775
Then what's the point?

287
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:52,678
It unlocks the cash register.

288
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,550
Put in whatever code you wish.

289
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,418
Here we are.

290
00:11:59,418 --> 00:12:01,420
Now, I'd just
like a cup of coffee

291
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:03,923
and a quiet place to drink it.

292
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:04,890
Can do, sir.

293
00:12:05,324 --> 00:12:07,893
Okay, here's your change.

294
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:09,395
You're number four.

295
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,731
I'll bring it to your beanbag.

296
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,518
Now, you
have a bullet

297
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:34,587
lodged in your hip,
correct?

298
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,055
Do I?

299
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:38,057
Oh! That's right, I do.

300
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:41,060
Sometimes I forget,
the way Daphne takes care of me.

301
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,562
She's the best.

302
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:44,897
All right.

303
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:46,966
And how would you rate your
level of comfort during therapy?

304
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:49,969
Oh, I don't think you could come up with a number high enough,

305
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:52,938
so I'll just say... 30.

306
00:12:53,372 --> 00:12:55,307
(phone ringing)

307
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,543
Sorry.

308
00:12:57,843 --> 00:12:58,911
Oh, it's my nanny.

309
00:12:58,911 --> 00:12:59,912
Well, not my nanny.

310
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:01,914
Wouldn't that be something?

311
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:03,282
Do you mind?

312
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:04,316
No. Please go ahead.

313
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,285
Hi.

314
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,354
What are you doing?

315
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:09,355
What do you think?

316
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:10,256
I'm making you
look good.

317
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:11,690
Yeah? Well, stop it.

318
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:13,025
My work speaks for itself.

319
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:14,360
Oh, Daphne, I love you,

320
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,828
but sometimes
you can be so naive.

321
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:17,296
Sure, you're good at the job

322
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:19,298
but you need
a little salesmanship.

323
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:20,599
That's why I'm here.

324
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,168
If you so much as...

325
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:23,469
Sorry about that.

326
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:24,970
Suzie got stuck
in the laundry chute again.

327
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,372
Oh, poor thing

328
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:27,740
How old is she?

329
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:29,141
What's the difference?

330
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:31,944
After tomorrow,
she's not our nanny anymore.

331
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,648
All right.
Shall we begin, Martin?

332
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:36,448
Are you kidding?

333
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:39,985
This is my favorite
part of the day.

334
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:42,354
(groans)

335
00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:43,355
Whenever you're ready, Daphne.

336
00:13:43,789 --> 00:13:45,357
First I like to start

337
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:48,360
with some simple range
of motion exercises

338
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,362
to warm up the muscles.

339
00:13:50,362 --> 00:13:54,366
Oh! Am I on a cloud?

340
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:57,870
'Cause that's how it feels, like I'm on a cloud.

341
00:14:00,105 --> 00:14:02,174
Then some strokes around the flexor,

342
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:03,609
smoothing
out any knots.

343
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:06,011
Do you feel any discomfort,
Martin?

344
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:07,279
Discomfort?

345
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:08,347
Try disbelief.

346
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:10,850
I don't know how she does it

347
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:13,853
You know, physical therapy
shouldn't be a pleasure trip

348
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,354
It is challenging, healing work.

349
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:17,256
You really need to be digging
into the muscles there, Daphne.

350
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:18,691
Yeah.

351
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:19,692
Let me show you.

352
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:23,963
Ah!

353
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:26,131
That's digging, all right.

354
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:27,533
Oh, it's not so bad.

355
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,535
I think you've just been
pampered a little too long, huh?

356
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:32,037
Whoa!

357
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:33,539
That is the sound
of progress.

358
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:34,940
You think you can
work like this?

359
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:36,876
Watch me.

360
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:39,879
(cracks knuckles)

361
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,885
(whines)

362
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:49,889
You can stop
checking the door.

363
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,224
Frasier swore
he'd never come back here.

364
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:54,059
I'm not worried about him.

365
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:56,562
Yes, we do have a pact
to boycott Nervosa,

366
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:59,064
but I only came
in here because I saw you sitting alone,

367
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:00,065
and I thought
you needed company

368
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:02,568
Are you ready
for some more music?!

369
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:03,502
ALL:
Yeah!

370
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:06,405
Oh, fudge. Time to go.

371
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,407
Why don't you like Ben?

372
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:09,909
He's really nice.

373
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,411
He was selling
his CDs outside.

374
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:14,914
I got Abbey Road
and the soundtrack from Grease.

375
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,348
I'm going to
 need a little bit

376
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:17,683
of help with this one.

377
00:15:17,983 --> 00:15:19,551
What about you, sir?
What about you?

378
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,819
Can you keep
 a steady beat for me?

379
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,521
Sorry, no.

380
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:24,690
What do you think, Nervosa, is he the man for the job?

381
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:25,925
(all cheer)

382
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,426
That's-that's...

383
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:28,761
He doesn't really think
you mean it!

384
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,429
Go!

385
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:33,666
If I do this,
will you take a break?

386
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:35,100
Yeah, I love breaks, yeah.

387
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,568
He says, "Yes"!

388
00:15:36,568 --> 00:15:38,637
(cheering)

389
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:45,411
I'm sorry. Are you going
to stick with that 4/4 tempo?

390
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:47,913
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

391
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:49,281
Do you call that sort
of an andante feeling?

392
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:51,417
Just shake it, okay?

Oh, don't you run,
you coward!

I'll be right back.

By the way, ten dollars

is still the best price for Quadrophenia!

413
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:49,942
Well, well,
look who's here.

414
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,611
I thought you were
Nervosa non grata.

415
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:55,347
I had no place else to go.

416
00:16:55,614 --> 00:16:57,182
Would you like
your usual?

417
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,685
More than you could possibly know.

418
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,053
This is a song that I wrote

419
00:17:01,053 --> 00:17:02,454
about doing the right thing.

420
00:17:02,821 --> 00:17:03,889
Oh, Lord.

421
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:05,391
I'm going to need that to go

422
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:06,859
I think we always know in our hearts

423
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:08,327
what the right thing is,

424
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:10,629
but we don't always have
the courage to do it.

425
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,231
In my case

426
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:12,998
I knew this guy

427
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:16,001
what was playing around
with a woman.

428
00:17:16,001 --> 00:17:18,871
But what she didn't know
was he already had a girlfriend.

429
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:22,741
Anyway, I was the only one what knew the facts,

430
00:17:22,741 --> 00:17:24,710
but what was I to do?

431
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,612
Tell the guy to back off?

432
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:29,481
Tell the girl that s
he was dating a sleaze?

433
00:17:29,848 --> 00:17:35,287
So I thought and I thought,
and here's what I done.

434
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:36,221
(snapping sound)

435
00:17:36,688 --> 00:17:37,756
Oh, what a drag.
I broke a string.

436
00:17:37,756 --> 00:17:38,724
Anyway, I'll be back
in a moment.

437
00:17:42,027 --> 00:17:43,562
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
What?

438
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:44,596
What happened?

439
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:45,931
What?

440
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:47,566
In the song, what happened?

441
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,368
I have to think
all the way through it.

442
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:50,369
Eh, eh...

443
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:52,237
"I knew a guy
who had a wandering eye..."

444
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:53,639
Yes, yes, we know that part.

445
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:54,506
What next?

446
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:55,908
"He met a lady,
he told her a lie."

447
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,409
Right, right.
And then?

448
00:17:57,409 --> 00:18:00,712
Chorus... repeat chorus.

449
00:18:00,712 --> 00:18:03,382
The end! How did it end?!

I said I'm coming!

452
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:18,063
Frasier,
what can I do for you?

453
00:18:18,063 --> 00:18:19,565
Avery, we need to talk.

454
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:21,567
I'm a little busy
at the moment.

455
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,568
I'm sorry. It can't wait.

456
00:18:23,068 --> 00:18:24,503
I know about you and Julia Wilcox.

457
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,405
I have no idea what...
Oh, stop that!

458
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:27,906
You are a married man.

459
00:18:27,906 --> 00:18:29,908
I realize this may
be fun and games to you,

460
00:18:29,908 --> 00:18:30,776
but she could get hurt.

461
00:18:31,076 --> 00:18:33,045
This is really not a good time.

462
00:18:33,345 --> 00:18:34,379
And why the hell not?

463
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:35,881
JULIA: Because I'm in the closet.

464
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:45,958
Uh... I had no idea.

465
00:18:46,391 --> 00:18:47,826
I didn't mean for you
to overhear...
What?

466
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:49,795
That Avery's married?

467
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:50,796
I already know.

468
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:52,064
You do?

469
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:54,800
We're having an affair,
you idiot.

470
00:18:57,269 --> 00:18:58,637
Oh.

471
00:18:59,037 --> 00:19:01,607
Well, I'm sorry.

472
00:19:02,107 --> 00:19:02,941
I thought
I was helping you.

473
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:04,276
Are you finished helping yet?

474
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:06,145
Yes, as a matter
of fact, I am.

475
00:19:06,411 --> 00:19:08,981
I am also finished thinking
that you and I owe each other

476
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,482
the loyalty
of professional kinship.

477
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:12,484
From this day forward,
we are merely coworkers,

478
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:13,318
cut-and-dried.

479
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:14,686
And as for you,

480
00:19:14,686 --> 00:19:18,690
I am deducting my mileage
here as a business expense!

481
00:19:22,694 --> 00:19:25,097
Unbelievable.

482
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:26,431
Are you all right?

483
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:30,335
Yeah. Yeah,
he was just trying to help

484
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:33,338
in his own heavy-handed way.

485
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:37,309
He was always trying
to be the hero.

486
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:39,244
You know, one night,
back at Oxford,

487
00:19:39,611 --> 00:19:41,680
he crawled out onto a ledge

488
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,950
to rescue what turned out
to be a gargoyle.

489
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:46,251
(both chuckle)

490
00:19:46,251 --> 00:19:48,120
(phone rings)

491
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:53,025
Ah! It's my wife.

492
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,026
Excuse me.

493
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:54,960
Hello.

494
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:56,862
Hello, darling.

495
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,864
I miss you, too.

496
00:19:59,264 --> 00:20:01,833
Uh... not long.

497
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,842
When does the alleged music start?

498
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:12,711
It doesn't.
Ben quit.

499
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:15,714
Really? Why?

500
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:19,785
Well, well.

501
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:21,687
That's quite a sharp-looking three-piece cage.

502
00:20:22,187 --> 00:20:23,188
What happened?

503
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:24,523
Well, you know, I don't really know.

504
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:26,892
Some little blond doxy
came in here

505
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,393
and hooked me up
with a job

506
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:29,761
at the Pelham Bay Bank.

507
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:31,129
Have you got my check, old man?

508
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:32,564
In the back.

509
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,500
Would you like that
for here or to go?

510
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:39,404
For here. I'm staying.

511
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:41,907
Congratulations, Frasier.

512
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:43,742
You got your cafe back.

513
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,644
Whatever.

514
00:20:48,213 --> 00:20:50,015
Say, Julia, wait.

515
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,485
Didn't you used
to be on the board

516
00:20:53,485 --> 00:20:54,486
of the Pelham Bay Bank?

517
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,955
