1
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,878
Mimsy, wait!

2
00:00:11,878 --> 00:00:14,247
Please
I can explain!
Oh, don't bother.

3
00:00:14,247 --> 00:00:17,083
And I bet you don't
even have Tourette's Syndrome!

4
00:00:17,584 --> 00:00:18,585
Poop!

5
00:00:18,585 --> 00:00:20,120
Hell! Damn!

6
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,588
Oh!

7
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:26,092
Lose my number!

8
00:00:26,092 --> 00:00:27,427
Chef Etienne!

9
00:00:27,427 --> 00:00:28,895
Oh, dear God.

10
00:00:28,895 --> 00:00:32,198
I hope you're happy.

11
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:33,566
Me?

12
00:00:33,566 --> 00:00:36,069
You're the one who suggested that flaming kabobs

13
00:00:36,569 --> 00:00:38,304
might lend a festive air.

14
00:00:38,304 --> 00:00:43,376
I didn't know Ben Corbett'toupee would go up like that.

15
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:45,111
Oh, quiet, both of you.

16
00:00:45,111 --> 00:00:46,112
It's done.

17
00:00:46,112 --> 00:00:49,549
Buon giorno!

18
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:51,384
NILES:
Party's over, Dad.

19
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:53,353
You mean, I'm
not the Count anymore?

20
00:00:53,353 --> 00:00:54,721
Afraid not.

21
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,623
Why is it that we can't seem

22
00:00:56,623 --> 00:00:58,958
to pull off
a simple dinner party?

23
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:01,261
Because you always go overboard.

24
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:03,129
Yes, but this one
was bare bones!

25
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:04,464
Simplicity itself.

26
00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:06,800
One of your goats
just threw up in the kitchen.

27
00:01:09,302 --> 00:01:10,303
(goat bleating)

28
00:01:10,303 --> 00:01:11,304
Oh!

29
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:19,079
NILES:
Oh, hello.

30
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,081
How goes
the installation?

31
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:23,516
Well, we had to put in
a transformer for the
DC,

32
00:01:23,516 --> 00:01:26,352
so after we pull the wires, brace the beam,

33
00:01:26,352 --> 00:01:27,620
she'll be ready to roll.

34
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:28,621
Ah.

35
00:01:31,624 --> 00:01:32,625
Daphne, Daphne.

36
00:01:34,127 --> 00:01:35,895
You know the Mike Shaw
painting

37
00:01:35,895 --> 00:01:37,430
that I'm donating
to the museum?

38
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:40,166
Frasier suggested we throw
a farewell dinner party for it.

39
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:41,701
We've invited
some fellow collectors.

40
00:01:42,168 --> 00:01:45,305
Um, Niles,
I've been thinking.

41
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:48,308
Come and sit down, darling.

42
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:52,278
Maybe it's time

43
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:54,747
you stopped throwing
dinner parties

44
00:01:54,747 --> 00:01:56,049
with your brother.

45
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:57,884
What?

46
00:01:57,884 --> 00:02:00,820
You don't exactly have
the best track record.

47
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:03,256
Well, throwing dinner parties
is an art.

48
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:05,091
It takes time to perfect.

49
00:02:05,091 --> 00:02:07,360
No.

50
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,361
But...

51
00:02:08,361 --> 00:02:10,864
No.

52
00:02:11,364 --> 00:02:13,299
No, it has to stop.
53
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:17,203
Maybe you and I should try
throwing a party together.

53
00:02:17,203 --> 00:02:19,706
You and me?

54
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:20,707
It's such a big step.

55
00:02:21,207 --> 00:02:22,041
Are you sure?

56
00:02:24,277 --> 00:02:27,714
Maybe it's time we
entertained as a couple.

57
00:02:28,214 --> 00:02:30,483
Oh, thank you, darling.

58
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:31,718
Excuse me.

59
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:33,586
It's after 4:00.
What if I finish this tomorrow?

60
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:34,888
Well, I suppose...

61
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:36,222
Oh, no,
you don't.

62
00:02:36,222 --> 00:02:38,057
You said one day
when I hired you

63
00:02:38,057 --> 00:02:39,559
and that's what it's going to be.

64
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:40,560
So get crackin
g

65
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,061
'cause something's going to be hanging

66
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:43,897
from that rafter
by the end of the day.

67
00:02:45,231 --> 00:02:46,566
Yes, ma'am.

68
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:52,539
Daphne, you handled that
so masterfully

69
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:54,040
as if he weren't wearing

70
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:56,543
that authoritative
tool belt at all.

71
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:01,981
Oh, Niles, Niles.
Thank goodness you're here.

72
00:03:01,981 --> 00:03:04,918
I am simply percolating
with party ideas.

73
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:05,919
(sighs)

74
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:08,254
Listen.
Have you thought
of inviting

75
00:03:08,254 --> 00:03:09,088
the artist himself?

76
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:10,890
He lives in town, you know?

77
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:12,659
Yes, I extended an invitation
through his gallery

78
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:13,626
but he declined.

79
00:03:13,626 --> 00:03:14,627
Oh. That's too bad.

80
00:03:15,094 --> 00:03:16,095
Well, then, I have come up

81
00:03:16,095 --> 00:03:19,132
with the perfect entertainment
for our little art crowd.

82
00:03:19,632 --> 00:03:22,135
It's a radical tableau
vivant troupe.

83
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:25,138
I don't know.

84
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:27,640
But they do provide
smocks and shower caps

85
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,075
so we're covered.

86
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:33,379
Frasier, Daphne and I
are throwing the party.

87
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:40,987
Daphne.

88
00:03:42,855 --> 00:03:44,424
Ah, fine. Suit yourself.

89
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:45,925
It's your painting.

90
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:48,895
I suppose I could just whip up
my signature dish.

91
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:52,198
Daphne's handling the food.

92
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,501
Lovely.

93
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:57,503
So you'll be serving
those sad brown chunks

94
00:03:57,503 --> 00:03:59,505
that make their way
from plate to napkin

95
00:03:59,505 --> 00:04:00,974
bypassing mouth completely.

96
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:04,978
It's called
"Piccadilly Beef"

97
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:06,980
and I talked her
out of it, thank God.

98
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,817
The whole thing's
being catered.

99
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:12,318
We're having Cornish
game hens

100
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:14,320
wild rice stuffing,
wonderful sides

101
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,255
and all heat and serve.

102
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:18,157
Stuffin'!

103
00:04:18,157 --> 00:04:19,659
Lovely.

104
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,161
I think you'd be happy
to be just a guest for once.

105
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:23,997
Just a guest!

106
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,832
In my brother's home.

107
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:28,268
I've never been
just a guest before.

108
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:31,638
Before, I always felt
like family.

109
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:34,574
Oh, look,
here she is now.

110
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:37,076
The hostess
with the mostest.

111
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:38,845
I see Niles told you.

112
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:40,146
Yes. I'm sorry

113
00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:42,148
I won't be attending
your debut soiree, Daphne.

114
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:45,084
I hope that doesn't throw off your seating plan.

115
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:48,454
It's going to be a buffet.

116
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:50,390
Buffet!

117
00:04:55,561 --> 00:04:59,799
Well, if you should
need any help

118
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,834
you know my phone number.

119
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:05,104
Number three
on our speed dial.

120
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:09,609
Number three.

121
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:10,610
Interesting.

122
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:18,618
I can't believe
how calm you are.

123
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:20,620
I'd be a nervous wreck by now.

124
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,121
Well, I was nervous at first

125
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:23,623
but every step I thought,

126
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:25,591
"How would Frasier
and Niles do this?"

127
00:05:26,025 --> 00:05:27,860
And didn't do that.

128
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:30,063
MRS. MOON:
Daphne, I'm home!

129
00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:32,365
Coming, Mom!

130
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:36,235
Where's the video?

131
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:38,037
I thought you were
going to rent Castaway.

132
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:41,074
If I wanted to watch
someone talk to a volleyball

133
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:43,576
for two hours, I would have
stayed in Manchester

134
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:45,011
with your Aunt Evelyn.

135
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,413
Well, what are
you going to do all night?

136
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,916
Oh, you needn't worry
about me.

137
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:51,417
I'm going to watch a boxing match

138
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:52,852
on pay-per-view.

139
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:56,255
There's nothing like
two, great, sweaty beasts

140
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:59,258
beating each other senseless.

141
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:00,760
I miss your father.

142
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:04,263
Come on, Alice

143
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:06,265
It's time to put
 away your crayons.

144
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:07,266
Lookit.

145
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:08,768
I wrote my name
really big.

146
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:10,069
see.
Oh, let's

147
00:06:10,336 --> 00:06:14,273
There and there and there

148
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,109
and there.

149
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:17,110
(gasps)

150
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,044
Oh, my God!

151
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:20,480
Alice!

152
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,949
Oh, Daphne, I'm so sorry

153
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:24,417
Oh, it's not to worry.

154
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:25,952
It'll come out.

155
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:27,754
It's only
a little crayon.

156
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:29,055
That's worse.

157
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,290
I can handle this.

158
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:34,127
Niles has an art restorer
he uses all the time.

159
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:34,927
I'll get his card.

160
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,163
I'm sorry, Mommy.

161
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,464
I know, honey.

162
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:39,966
But from now on,

163
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:43,770
just only sign
your own artwork, okay?

164
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,505
'Cause mine is prettier.

165
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:49,809
Yeah.

166
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,645
Here's his business card.

167
00:06:52,645 --> 00:06:54,647
Okay, I'll run it right over.

168
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:56,482
Just tell him it's
an emergency.

169
00:06:56,482 --> 00:06:58,317
s.
We're very good customer

170
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:02,789
I'm just glad Niles isn't here.

171
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:06,292
He doesn't take these things in his stride like I do.

172
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:08,661
There.

173
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:10,630
Another fire put out.

174
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:15,668
Oh, my God! The hens.

175
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:19,906
Oh, my God!

176
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:21,407
Okay, don't panic.

177
00:07:21,874 --> 00:07:23,910
I can handle this.

178
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:33,419
Oh, look at that!

179
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:35,888
Daphne, now what
are you going to do?

180
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:37,857
Well, I can't call
the caterer.

181
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:40,793
They were doing a big party
and we were their last stop.

182
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,228
Oh, I know. Call Frasier.

183
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:43,496
He's got to know some caterers

184
00:07:43,696 --> 00:07:45,765
Well, he was upset
that I took over his job

185
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:49,268
as Lord Mayor of Party Town,
but he did offer his help.

186
00:07:49,268 --> 00:07:50,203
I hope he meant it.

187
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:52,205
Go, take the painting.

188
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:53,272
Yes. Come on, Alice.

189
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:54,273
Good luck.

190
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:55,775
Daphne, you're never going

191
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:57,276
to get a caterer
at this late hour.

192
00:07:57,276 --> 00:07:58,277
But don't worry,

193
00:07:58,711 --> 00:08:01,247
I think I can solve
your little problem.

194
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:02,281
I'll be right there.

195
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:06,719
As usual, Frasier
has to save the day.

196
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:11,257
As usual, Martin has
to hear about it.

197
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:25,404
Suit up, boys, we're going in.

198
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:37,483
All right, I need a full
rundown of the situation.

199
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:40,486
Well, I think I told
you about the hens
Mm-hmm.

200
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:42,388
which I burned
Ooh.

201
00:08:42,755 --> 00:08:45,324
Um, I'm hoping we have enough ice, and...

202
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:46,259
Mm-hmm.

203
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:48,127
I probably shouldn't have dressed

204
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,662
the salad
this afternoon

205
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:51,964
Oh.

206
00:08:51,964 --> 00:08:53,299
But I'm pretty sure

207
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:55,368
the soup is okay.

208
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:56,836
(sniffing)

209
00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:58,704
White wine.

210
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:03,776
What do you think?
Will we make it?

211
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:10,316
I feel so stupid. I made a big
deal about telling Niles

212
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:11,884
how I could handle this
on my own.

213
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:13,719
All right, all right, listen.

214
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:14,987
He doesn't have to know.

215
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:17,056
If you just keep
him out of my way,

216
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:19,825
I will gladly play
your invisible
little kitchen elf

217
00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:21,160
You would do that for me?

218
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,128
Oh, of course, Daphne!

219
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:24,664
Now, listen, I've brought
everything I need

220
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:27,667
to make my signature
pomegranate-honey sauce,
all right?

221
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:29,936
I will need a ramekin
for each of your guests.

222
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,740
Here we are.

223
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,242
Oh, dear,
this is bad.

224
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,209
What?

225
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,078
Well, there are two
that are mismatched.

226
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:41,314
It's all right if they're
 all mismatched

227
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:43,049
or... or even in pairs, but two?

228
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:44,317
It's just unheard of.

229
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,152
NILES:
Daphne?

230
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:48,154
Oh, my God,
it's Niles.

231
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:49,155
What should we do?

232
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:50,656
Don't worry.
I'm right in here.

233
00:09:52,658 --> 00:09:54,160
Ah, sorry I'm late.

234
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,661
You look beautiful.
Darling.

235
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:59,231
I had the worst time finding
miniature easels for the table.

236
00:09:59,498 --> 00:10:00,533
Oh, but it was worth it.

237
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:01,534
I think so.

238
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:03,002
The place looks lovely,

239
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:05,004
and the new chandelier
is absolutely spectacular.

240
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:06,439
But why is the painting covered?

241
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:07,907
Well, because I thought

242
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:10,409
a proper unveiling
would be an event.

243
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:12,211
We'll do it after dinner.

244
00:10:12,478 --> 00:10:14,046
Oh, oh, why don't we
do it after cocktails?

245
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:15,548
It'll make for lively
dinner conversation.

246
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:17,550
Trust me, after will be better

247
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:21,587
And by the way, the kitchen is off-limits to you.

248
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:24,090
You've already slowed me down

249
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:26,025
(doorbell rings )

250
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:28,527
Well, someone's tediously punctual. Shall we?

251
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:30,029
I'll be right out.

252
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:30,997
Okay.

253
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:36,535
You know, if he had any resourcefulness at all

254
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:38,537
he would know that tiny easels abound

255
00:10:38,537 --> 00:10:40,539
at Lilliputiana Dollhouse and Miniatures.

256
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:47,413
Dad... right.

257
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:50,416
Listen, I need you
to do me a favor.

258
00:10:52,451 --> 00:10:54,487
I want you to get me
my ramekins, all right,

259
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:55,488
and then bring them here,

260
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:57,857
but come in the back way,
so Niles doesn't see you

261
00:10:58,190 --> 00:10:59,759
No, ramekins.

262
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:03,262
Well, they're small,
round, ceramic dishes.

263
00:11:03,262 --> 00:11:06,198
I keep them in the lower
left-hand kitchen cabinet.

264
00:11:06,565 --> 00:11:10,136
All right, no, no, no,
those are tapas dishes.

265
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:12,138
Right, those are for soy sauce.

266
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:13,639
Oh, honestly, Dad, you know

267
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:15,641
sometimes I think
you listen to me.

268
00:11:15,641 --> 00:11:18,144
I-I said sometimes
I don't think you...

269
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:21,614
No, I said sometimes I--
I see what you're doing.

270
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,582
Are we the first
to arrive?

271
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:26,419
Oh, you are
refreshingly on time.

272
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:28,287
How about some drinks?

273
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:29,789
Don't mind me.

274
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:33,659
I'm just down
to nick a bottle of
the good stuff.

275
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:37,129
They normally hide it from me.

276
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,565
This is my mother,
Gertrude Moon.

277
00:11:39,965 --> 00:11:41,033
Yes, Antonia
and Alex.

278
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:42,368
Hello.
Pleasure to meet you.

279
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:46,172
Oh, Mum, as long as you're going upstairs, take the coats.

280
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:47,973
Yes.
Is this the Mike Shaw painting?

281
00:11:47,973 --> 00:11:49,308
I'm dying to see it.

282
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:50,876
Oh, oh, sorry.
No peeking.

283
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:53,279
You'll have
to wait until
the unveiling.

284
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:55,648
That sounds like a challenge.

285
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:58,517
You're going to have
to watch me like a hawk.

286
00:11:58,818 --> 00:12:00,186
Won't that be fun?

287
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:01,520
(loud clatter)

288
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,955
What was that?

289
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:05,357
Don't worry, Niles, that's my domain.

290
00:12:05,357 --> 00:12:07,126
All right.
Why don't you take

291
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:09,361
our guest on a tour of the library?

292
00:12:09,795 --> 00:12:11,831
Oh, all right.
This way, this way.

293
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:15,367
Is it true you still collect
Edwardian utility bills?

294
00:12:15,367 --> 00:12:16,869
Oh, yes. They're fascinating.

295
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:18,337
For example,
did you know that

296
00:12:18,804 --> 00:12:21,373
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle
was a notorious water hog?

297
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:23,876
But you don't have
to take my word for it.

298
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,146
Frasier!

299
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:29,014
I dropped a pan;
everything's all right.

300
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:30,015
MRS. MOON:
Daphne!

301
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:32,017
For God's sakes, all right!

302
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:37,523
I'm having trouble
ordering the boxing match.

303
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:39,024
I don't understand.

304
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:42,027
This never happens
with the nudie programming.

305
00:12:42,027 --> 00:12:44,029
Give it here.

306
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:45,531
(doorbell rings)
Oh, damn.

307
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:48,801
You answer that,
I'll take care of this.

308
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:50,603
You can come out now.

309
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:53,038
Honestly, Daphne, if these interruptions don't stop,

310
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:56,108
my signature sauce will
be reduced to a monogram.

311
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,076
(chuckling)

312
00:12:57,476 --> 00:12:59,545
I'm using humor
to make a point, hmm?

313
00:13:01,313 --> 00:13:03,382
Hello. I'm Daphe's Mum.

314
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:04,650
I'm Bill...
Don't bother.

315
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:06,819
I'm just letting you in.

316
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:08,721
Hi. Is this the Crane place?

317
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:10,222
I'm Mike Shaw.

318
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:13,225
Mr. Shaw, we thought we were just going
to see your painting.

319
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:15,227
We didn't realize you were coming.

320
00:13:15,227 --> 00:13:16,729
That was a last-minute thing.

321
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:17,730
Uh, call me Mike.

322
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,231
Mike.

323
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:20,633
Hello.

324
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,501
I'm Gertrude.

325
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:23,903
rino
I'm Bill Talla

326
00:13:23,903 --> 00:13:27,740
and this is my wife, Sharon Kwiatkowski-Tallarino.

327
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:29,041
May I just say that

328
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:32,912
you are our greatest living
American artist, bar none.

329
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:33,913
Barnone.

330
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:35,881
(cell phone rings)
Excuse me.

331
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:39,385
Is there anything worse
than making phony conversation

332
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:40,386
with phony art lovers?

333
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:43,389
Yes. Living with one.

334
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:44,890
My son-in-law is the host.

335
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:48,394
And if you didn't want your bu
kissed, you shouldn't have come.

336
00:13:48,894 --> 00:13:50,162
That's all they do here.

337
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:52,698
I wasn't going to come,
but my gallery insisted.

338
00:13:52,698 --> 00:13:55,935
Oh, well, I am going to go
upstairs watching a boxing match

339
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:58,304
should you feel the need
to get away.

340
00:13:58,537 --> 00:14:01,440
Well, I probably shouldn't
but maybe just the first round.

341
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,409
All right, then.

342
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:05,911
You wouldn't have
anything to drink
up there, would you?

343
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:06,912
Just liquor.

344
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:12,418
So, it actually took
George Bernard Shaw longer

345
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:13,919
to rectify his billing error

346
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:15,921
than it did for him
to writeMan and Superman

347
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:18,958
That's Great.
Are those the drinks?

348
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:20,459
Yes.
(doorbell rings)

349
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:21,460
Oh, excuse me.

350
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,461
Bill and Sharon.

351
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:26,966
Thad and Jeremy, welcome.

352
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:28,801
Niles!
Niles.

353
00:14:29,068 --> 00:14:30,002
Hey.
Hi!

354
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:31,303
Where's your better half?

355
00:14:31,737 --> 00:14:32,771
NILES:
Oh, ah,
here she is now.

356
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:34,807
Oh, I meant Frasier.

357
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:38,310
My brother's not
coming this evening.

358
00:14:38,744 --> 00:14:41,313
But he's always, always,
always at your parties:

359
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:43,315
Frasier and yellowtail
carpaccio.

360
00:14:43,315 --> 00:14:44,750
Has the world gone mad?

361
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:47,519
Not yet. We still
have carpaccio.
(chuckles)

362
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:51,323
You've got two choices.

363
00:14:51,323 --> 00:14:53,826
You can walk either walk away
from the painting,

364
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:56,195
or you can limp away
from the painting.

365
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:58,030
Walk.

366
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:01,333
Mother, coats.

367
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:03,168
Yes, Master.

368
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:08,407
Niles, we are so sorry, we have to go;
we have a baby-sitter.

369
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:09,909
No, that's terrible.

370
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,845
The worst part is, we're going to miss dinner with Mike Shaw.

371
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:14,914
I can't believe you got
that old hermit to come.

372
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,181
Mike, Mike Shaw is here?
What?!

373
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:18,083
Where is he?
He must have wandered off.

374
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,585
He's not at all
like I pictured him--

375
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,020
older guy, white hair, cane.

376
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,588
I think he's wearing
a plaid flannel shirt.

377
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:23,856
He's quite a character.

378
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:25,157
Really?

379
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:26,659
(all talking at once)

380
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:31,397
Here you go.

381
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:32,731
Oh, Dad, finally.

382
00:15:32,998 --> 00:15:34,066
If you had said nut bowls,

383
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:36,068
I would have gotten
them right off.

384
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:38,037
Yes, yes, all right.
Now, listen.

385
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:40,539
I need you to run to
the grocery store for me

386
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:43,342
and pick up somesel de mer,
some olive tapenade,

387
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:46,045
balsamic vinegar and some
English Stilton cheese.

388
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:47,446
Have you got that?

389
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,848
You lost me
after Sally's mare.

390
00:15:49,848 --> 00:15:50,816
All right, fine.

391
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:52,251
I'll write it down

392
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:53,285
NILES:
Coming right up.

393
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:54,286
DAPHNE:
Niles, no.

394
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:55,788
Oh, Dad, hide in there!

395
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:58,791
Oh, Dad!
Oh, I thought so.

396
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,292
What are you doing here?

397
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,294
I just brought
some dishes over.

398
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:03,662
Wh...?

399
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,031
You're not supposed
to be in the kitchen, honey.

400
00:16:06,031 --> 00:16:07,032
I don't
know what happened

401
00:16:07,032 --> 00:16:08,534
and I don't want to know how it happened

402
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:10,035
but somehow, our
guests are all

403
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:11,904
under the impression
that Dad is Mike Shaw.

404
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:13,405
Who?

405
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,407
He's the artist-- the painter of the painting

406
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:16,408
that everyone
is here to see

407
00:16:16,408 --> 00:16:17,910
What are we going to do?

408
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:18,877
It's not a problem.

409
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:21,413
We'll take your father
out the back door

410
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:22,414
and make up an excuse.

411
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:26,919
Better yet, we'll take him out the front door.

412
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:28,420
That way, people
can see him leave.

413
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,355
Uh, okay.

414
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:31,290
You know zero about art;
don't say a word

415
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:33,258
or these people will see
right through you.

416
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:36,228
Yeah, I'm sure a phony
will really stand out
at this party.

417
00:16:39,098 --> 00:16:40,666
Oh, this must be
Mr. Shaw.

418
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,067
NILES:
I have very
bad news.

419
00:16:42,434 --> 00:16:44,436
Mr. Shaw is not
feeling well,

420
00:16:44,436 --> 00:16:45,504
so he has to leave.

421
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:46,939
Oh, oh, I can't...

422
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:50,009
I can't let you go without
getting your autograph.

423
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:53,012
And if you could draw
something on it.

424
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,014
Well, actually I do a pretty good rocket.

425
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:58,417
No, no, Antonia,
Mr. Shaw's not
giving away art.

426
00:16:58,717 --> 00:17:00,152
Just write Mike Shaw.

427
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:01,487
Now, isn't that nice.

428
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:02,955
Okay, and there you go.
That's for you.

429
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:03,956
Come along,
come along.

430
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:05,457
Please, just say
a few words about

431
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:06,959
The Dry Wit
of the Sandwich Maker.

432
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:13,966
Who wants another tour?
Oh, I do.

433
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:16,135
Get out.

434
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,103
Niles, why don't
we show them the
secret passageway.

435
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:19,104
Oh, what
a good idea.

436
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:20,305
(doorbell ringing)

437
00:17:20,572 --> 00:17:21,640
I'll catch up with you.

438
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,042
Don't let them in
the panic room.

439
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:27,813
Oh, hello.

440
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:29,815
I'd almost given up on you.

441
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:30,816
Oh, it's lovely.

442
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:31,817
Thanks.

443
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:32,818
And if you don't mind,

444
00:17:33,318 --> 00:17:34,319
I find it's best to get paid

445
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:35,320
while there's still evidence.

446
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:36,822
Yes, of course, of course.

447
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:38,824
I'll tell you what,
if you'll just wheel it

448
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:39,825
over there by the
dining rotunda

449
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:40,759
I'll be right with you.

450
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,661
The coast is clear.

451
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:45,664
Come on, let's get
a bottle of champagne

452
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:47,166
and go back up.

453
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,601
Hey, you're Mike Shaw.

454
00:17:49,935 --> 00:17:51,470
I studied you in art school.

455
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:52,838
You're a major influence

456
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:54,673
That's very flattering.

457
00:17:54,673 --> 00:17:58,677
Now, shall we get back
upstairs for round three?

458
00:17:58,677 --> 00:18:01,080
Uh, she's talking
about the fight.

459
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:03,449
Of course, the night's
still young.

460
00:18:06,885 --> 00:18:09,855
And here... and that...
and here you go...

461
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:10,856
and... thank you.

462
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:12,391
No, no, thank you.

463
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:14,893
I just met one
of my heroes--
Mike Shaw.

464
00:18:14,893 --> 00:18:16,395
Oh, yes, in the hall?

465
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:17,763
No, right here.

466
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:19,198
Don't tell me--

467
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:22,000
white hair, cane,
plaid shirt, character.

468
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:25,003
I forgot the list.

469
00:18:25,003 --> 00:18:26,004
NILES:
Mr. Shaw.

470
00:18:26,004 --> 00:18:29,007
Oh, for God's sake

471
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:32,010
Dad, you're not
supposed to be here.

472
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:35,013
Niles, you're not
supposed to be here.

473
00:18:35,013 --> 00:18:37,516
And what's in here?

474
00:18:38,016 --> 00:18:40,519
Oh, Mr. Shaw, you came back.

475
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:41,954
I, uh... felt better.

476
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:43,922
Then you must talk to us
about your work.

477
00:18:43,922 --> 00:18:45,424
We're collectors,
you know.

478
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:46,325
Oh, but this
is a party.

479
00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:48,060
I, uh... I...

480
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,696
art all the time.

481
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:51,930
MAN:
Come on.

482
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:54,900
Let's get you
another drink.

483
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:55,734
Fun party.

484
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:57,069
It's nice to see you step out

485
00:18:57,603 --> 00:18:58,570
of Frasier's shadow.

486
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,572
I think he might have been
holding you back.

487
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,040
Okay, I have to get out there

488
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,542
before Dad says
something stupid.

489
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:04,543
Let's get these hens browning

490
00:19:05,043 --> 00:19:06,545
so we can eat as soon as
possible...

491
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:07,546
Mm...

492
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:08,947
that's Frasier's signature sauce.

493
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:10,816
Except it's
so much better.

494
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:13,752
I think you should
send him the recipe.

495
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:31,303
I'm holding him back.

496
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:35,807
Your sauce is
better than mine.

497
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:39,311
Honestly, I don't even
know why I try.

498
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:42,314
I stand here slaving over
a hot stove, and for what?

499
00:19:42,714 --> 00:19:44,283
Does anybody
appreciate me?

500
00:19:44,283 --> 00:19:46,618
No.

501
00:19:46,952 --> 00:19:50,022
Are you getting close,
Mr. Slovadkin?

502
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:52,824
These things
take time, Miss.

503
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:56,261
Who do you think I am,

504
00:19:56,261 --> 00:19:59,264
that mouse in the cartoons
that goes fast?

505
00:19:59,765 --> 00:20:00,666
What's his name?

506
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,100
Speedy Gonzalez.

507
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:04,469
No.

508
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:07,339
The little mouse,
with a big hat

509
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:10,242
and he goes very fast.

510
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:12,477
That's Speedy Gonzalez.

511
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:13,845
No. The mouse...

512
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:14,846
(phone ringing)

513
00:20:14,846 --> 00:20:16,248
This is going to drive
me crazy.

514
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:19,117
Hello.

515
00:20:19,117 --> 00:20:20,619
I have no idea.

516
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:24,623
Can't you just stall
dinner for a little while?

517
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:26,625
All right, don't yell.

518
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,894
My friend wants
to talk to you,
Mr. Slovadkin.

519
00:20:29,094 --> 00:20:31,163
Oh, it's very small.

520
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:35,167
Hello.

521
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:38,170
.
I'm going as fast as I can

522
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:43,175
I'm not that little mouse that goes zip all around.

523
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:45,177
What's his name?

524
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:47,613
No. That's what she said

525
00:20:49,514 --> 00:20:52,918
He's a mouse.

526
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:55,087
What impresses
me the most

527
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,389
is the way you
reinvent identity

528
00:20:57,389 --> 00:20:58,857
while recording
anonymity.

529
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:01,860
Well, that took
years to get down.

530
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:02,861
Sure, sure.

531
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:04,696
Come on,
tell us,

532
00:21:04,963 --> 00:21:06,965
what do you think of Warhol?

533
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:09,901
Crap.

534
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:12,537
Kienholz?

535
00:21:12,804 --> 00:21:13,872
Crap.

536
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,340
It is so refreshing

537
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:18,110
to have someone
speak so candidly.

538
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:21,847
And you have to believe me
'cause I'm a fancy-ass artist.

539
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:23,682
(laughing)

540
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:27,452
MAN:
Oh, hey, I know--

541
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:29,254
why don't you take us
through the house

542
00:21:29,254 --> 00:21:31,256
and tell us what you
think of Niles's art.

543
00:21:31,256 --> 00:21:33,258
Oh, yes,
please.

544
00:21:33,258 --> 00:21:34,760
Sure.

545
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:37,229
I've been waiting
to do that

546
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:38,530
for a long time.

547
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:40,232
You can't brown
the hens yet.

548
00:21:40,232 --> 00:21:43,302
If we wait any longer,
their skins will wrinkle

549
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:44,803
and my sauce
will separate.

550
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,305
Is that what
you want?

551
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:47,306
I...

552
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:50,309
Is that what
you want?!

553
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:52,311
NILES:
Daphne.

554
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:53,312
Damn it.

555
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:57,316
You're not supposed to be in here!

556
00:22:00,886 --> 00:22:01,386
I'm sorry.

557
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:02,888
Dad's run amok.

558
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:04,389
Why aren't the hens browning?

559
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:05,891
Because they're
not ready yet.

560
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:06,892
But they look ready.

561
00:22:07,392 --> 00:22:08,393
Yes, well, they're not.

562
00:22:08,393 --> 00:22:09,895
Then we'll just
serve them as is.

563
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:11,396
You can't,
they're not browned.

564
00:22:11,396 --> 00:22:12,397
.
We're going to

565
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:13,732
I'm going to get a platter.

566
00:22:14,032 --> 00:22:15,567
Don't open
that door.

567
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:18,337
Stop that.

568
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:19,338
I already saw him.

569
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:21,306
What are you
doing here?

570
00:22:21,306 --> 00:22:22,796
I am saving your party,

571
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:24,409
that's what I'm doing.

572
00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:25,410
Niles...

573
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:26,411
You don't have
to explain.

574
00:22:26,411 --> 00:22:27,913
Frasier's presence here

575
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:29,715
is clearly why this
party's gone awry.

576
00:22:29,948 --> 00:22:31,016
Oh, really?

577
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,951
Well, if that's
what you think,

578
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:36,021
then I will gladly take my
signature sauce and go.

579
00:22:36,421 --> 00:22:36,888
Your signature sauce?

580
00:22:37,255 --> 00:22:38,323
And that reminds me,

581
00:22:38,323 --> 00:22:39,825
you won't be needing to use my poultry shears.

582
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:40,826
No, no, no,
you can't.

583
00:22:40,826 --> 00:22:41,827
It's already here.

584
00:22:41,827 --> 00:22:42,828
This is mine.

585
00:22:43,228 --> 00:22:45,163
No, it-it's
on my property.

586
00:22:45,564 --> 00:22:47,132
Oh, stop it!
Stop it, both of you!

587
00:22:47,132 --> 00:22:48,467
Fine!

588
00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:52,504
(all gasping)

589
00:22:52,504 --> 00:22:54,940
What have you done?!

590
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,441
I'm not sorry.

591
00:22:56,441 --> 00:22:59,311
You've been asking
for this for years.

592
00:23:01,246 --> 00:23:03,315
No, it's not
what you think.

593
00:23:03,315 --> 00:23:04,812
See, yummy.

594
00:23:05,484 --> 00:23:06,551
(gasping)

595
00:23:06,985 --> 00:23:07,486
No, no, it's sauce.

596
00:23:07,986 --> 00:23:09,488
We just had a little
kitchen mishap.

597
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:10,489
We'll just get
this cleaned up.

598
00:23:10,989 --> 00:23:11,990
Wipe yourself
off with this.

599
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:12,924
Thanks, Dad.

600
00:23:13,258 --> 00:23:16,828
That is no Mike Shaw.

601
00:23:17,262 --> 00:23:18,630
What happened
to my painting?

602
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:20,298
Did you know
about this, Mike?

603
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:23,502
I may have.

604
00:23:23,835 --> 00:23:25,904
Oh, give it
up, Martin.

605
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:27,406
This isn't Mike Shaw.

606
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:28,407
.
It's Niles's father

607
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,742
What are you trying
to pull, Crane?

608
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:33,578
This is uncomfortable.

609
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:34,546
We should go.

610
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,883
DAPHNE:
No, no, no, please,
listen to me. Listen.

611
00:23:37,883 --> 00:23:39,684
Yes, there's been
some deception

612
00:23:40,185 --> 00:23:41,686
and things got out of hand,

613
00:23:41,686 --> 00:23:43,688
but no real harm has been done.

614
00:23:43,688 --> 00:23:45,190
I've made some mistakes.

615
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:46,691
People make mistakes.

616
00:23:46,691 --> 00:23:49,528
But that's no reason
to abandon them.

617
00:23:49,528 --> 00:23:51,797
This night can still
be a success.

618
00:23:51,797 --> 00:23:54,566
We've got the food,
and you're all here,

619
00:23:54,566 --> 00:23:57,369
and when I tell you about
what happened,

620
00:23:57,369 --> 00:23:59,871
we'll all have a good laugh about it.

621
00:23:59,871 --> 00:24:01,373
So, please, everybody stay?

622
00:24:02,874 --> 00:24:04,376
(all agreeing)

623
00:24:04,376 --> 00:24:05,177
Oh, thank you.

624
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:07,012
Well done, Daphne.

625
00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:08,880
(loud creaking)

626
00:24:12,717 --> 00:24:14,653
(creaking continues)

627
00:24:33,672 --> 00:24:35,140
Hello.

628
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:47,886
All right, get your coats.

629
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:56,828
Daphne...

630
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:59,331
congratulations.

631
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:01,833
