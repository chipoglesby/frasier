1
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:10,577
Well, I think we've got time
for one last caller.

2
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:13,079
Go ahead, Mindy, I'm listening
.

3
00:00:13,079 --> 00:00:16,249
(softly):
It's about my mother, Dr. Crane.

4
00:00:16,249 --> 00:00:17,817
Ever since I got married
she's been...

5
00:00:17,817 --> 00:00:21,287
Yes, the cashmere
turtleneck is $39.

6
00:00:21,287 --> 00:00:22,756
Excuse me, what?

7
00:00:22,756 --> 00:00:26,593
Sorry, I work in catalog sales
and my boss just walked past.

8
00:00:26,593 --> 00:00:28,061
So anyway, my mom...

9
00:00:28,061 --> 00:00:30,096
Yes, it's on sale until
the end of the month.

10
00:00:30,096 --> 00:00:31,598
Mindy, we are
pressed for time.

11
00:00:31,598 --> 00:00:32,599
Hold on, Frasier.

12
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:35,535
Cashmere for
under 40 bucks?

13
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:37,837
I'll take one
in black.

14
00:00:37,837 --> 00:00:39,239
In medium.

15
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:40,740
Wait, is that medium-medium

16
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:44,077
or unrealistic-
anorexic-model-medium?

17
00:00:44,077 --> 00:00:48,248
It sounds like you might
want to go for the large.

18
00:00:48,248 --> 00:00:49,082
Oh, really?

19
00:00:49,082 --> 00:00:50,450
And that's our show.

20
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:53,319
What size will Roz order?

21
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,321
Will she accessorize?

22
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:58,324
Tune in tomorrow for
the exciting conclusion.

23
00:00:58,324 --> 00:01:00,126
Good day, Seattle.

24
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,462
Dynamite show, Doc,
one of your best.

25
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:05,532
Rosalinda, great work
on the control panel.

26
00:01:05,532 --> 00:01:07,500
I'm going to start
calling you "Control Freak."

27
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,335
Well, you're probably
wondering

28
00:01:09,335 --> 00:01:11,671
"Who put a quarter in him
today?"

29
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:14,140
Just got a call
from my lawyer.

30
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,576
My divorce: final.

31
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:19,446
I'm back
to my tomcat days.

32
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:20,647
Lock up your daughters, Seattle.

33
00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:23,483
Kenny Daly's on the loose!

34
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:25,318
You might want to lose
the wedding ring, tomcat.

35
00:01:25,318 --> 00:01:26,686
Oh, yeah.

36
00:01:26,686 --> 00:01:29,155
Time to remove my shackle.

37
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:32,992
Well, that's weird.

38
00:01:32,992 --> 00:01:34,828
Ooh, that's really stuck.

39
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:36,663
That's funny.

40
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:39,165
That's how my wife described our marriage.

41
00:01:39,165 --> 00:01:40,667
"Stuck."

42
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:43,002
Well, you're not
stuck anymore, are you?!

43
00:01:43,002 --> 00:01:44,337
Oh, damn it, damn it.

44
00:01:44,337 --> 00:01:45,839
Kenny, Kenny,
come on, come on.

45
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:47,340
Come and sit down.

46
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,341
All right, here.

47
00:01:48,341 --> 00:01:50,844
Take a deep breath.

48
00:01:50,844 --> 00:01:52,345
I'm sorry.

49
00:01:52,345 --> 00:01:54,747
This thing's hit
 me like a ton of bricks.

50
00:01:54,747 --> 00:01:59,452
The only good news is I'll start getting a check every month.

51
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:02,655
Kenny, um...

52
00:02:02,655 --> 00:02:06,092
divorce can be one of life's most difficult transitions.

53
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:08,094
Have you considered
seeing a professional

54
00:02:08,094 --> 00:02:09,062
once or twice a week?

55
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:10,530
I thought about it

56
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,299
but prostitutes are expensive.

57
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:18,538
He means
a psychiatrist, Kenny.

58
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:21,074
That is what
you meant, right?

59
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:22,542
A shrink?
Oh, geez Louise.

60
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:24,544
I don't think I'd be comfortable talking
to a psychiatrist.

61
00:02:25,044 --> 00:02:26,045
Well, I'm a psychiatrist

62
00:02:26,045 --> 00:02:27,947
You're comfortable
talking to me, aren't you?

63
00:02:27,947 --> 00:02:29,749
Are you offering
to be my shrink?

64
00:02:29,749 --> 00:02:31,117
No.

65
00:02:31,117 --> 00:02:32,585
I could probably handle that.

66
00:02:32,585 --> 00:02:34,554
I was going to refer
you to someone.

67
00:02:34,554 --> 00:02:36,055
Well, can't you
help him, Frasier?

68
00:02:36,055 --> 00:02:38,391
Well, I don't know, Roz.

69
00:02:38,391 --> 00:02:39,726
Giving psychotherapy
to my employer?

70
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:42,295
It's a bit
of a gray area, isn't it?

71
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:45,765
Oh, come on, it's not
like he's a real boss.

72
00:02:45,765 --> 00:02:48,268
Yeah, Roz is right.

73
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:50,270
Come on, Doc, I could use a little help.

74
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:53,740
Well, I suppose if you'd like to stop by my place

75
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,241
and discuss your feelings
informally,

76
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:56,743
there'd be no harm in that

77
00:02:56,743 --> 00:02:58,745
Thanks, Doc.

78
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:00,213
And I'm paying
 you for your time.

79
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:02,015
Oh, no, no,
that's hardly necessary.

80
00:03:02,248 --> 00:03:04,250
No, no, no, no, no, I insist.
Now what do you get?

81
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,152
Kenny, don't worry about it. I'll gladly do it for free

82
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:08,054
What do you say we get together
Friday night?

83
00:03:08,054 --> 00:03:09,455
Thanks, Doc.

84
00:03:09,455 --> 00:03:12,458
I wish my ex-wife
was as agreeable as you.

85
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:14,761
And dead.

86
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:16,930
Okay, maybe tonight's better

87
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:25,238
And the one time I was winning

88
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:27,740
my dad "accidentally"
knocked over the checkerboard.

89
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:28,741
Ah.

90
00:03:28,741 --> 00:03:31,578
He made me pick up
all the pieces, too.

91
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:33,846
Fortunately, my mom was there
with an extra piece of cake.

92
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:35,748
(cries)

93
00:03:37,183 --> 00:03:38,685
I see.

94
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:41,688
A controlling,
narcissistic father

95
00:03:42,188 --> 00:03:43,690
and an overprotective mother.

96
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,693
It has all the earmarks

97
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:49,629
of a classic
Oedipus complex.

98
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:51,531
Well, well...

99
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:55,435
old friend, we meet again.

100
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:57,737
Now let me tell you

101
00:03:57,737 --> 00:04:00,106
your deep-rooted feeli
ngs of castration...

102
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:02,108
(watch timer beeping)

103
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:04,410
I'm afraid
our time is up

104
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,646
Wait. What?!

105
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:08,648
This has been fascinating.

106
00:04:08,648 --> 00:04:10,650
I believe we are
finally on the brink

107
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:11,651
of discovering a road

108
00:04:12,151 --> 00:04:13,152
into some real insights.

109
00:04:13,653 --> 00:04:14,153
I can't tell you

110
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:17,056
I believe I'm as
exhilarated as you are.

111
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:18,491
Yeah.

112
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:20,426
When are we going
to talk about my divorce?

113
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:24,797
You may not know it, Kenny,
but we already are.

114
00:04:24,797 --> 00:04:28,801
Now, for our next session,
I want you to write a letter

115
00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:31,804
telling your father
how you feel.

116
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:34,807
Don't send it, just write it.

117
00:04:34,807 --> 00:04:37,310
Homework? You never
said there was going
to be any homework.

118
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:38,811
It's all part of the process

119
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:40,313
Good night, Kenny.
But I...

120
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:44,984
Geez, I thought
that'd never end.

121
00:04:45,184 --> 00:04:47,153
Dad, how long have you
been in there?

122
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:49,856
The whole damn time.

123
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:51,190
I went in for a beer

124
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,692
and Kenny came in and started crying

125
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:54,694
and I was trapped.

126
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:56,195
How's talking about checkers

127
00:04:56,195 --> 00:04:58,531
supposed to help him
through a divorce?

128
00:04:58,531 --> 00:05:00,833
Dad, the inability to maintain
adult relationships

129
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:05,204
often has its roots
in parent-child trauma.

130
00:05:05,204 --> 00:05:07,607
What's your generation going to do when we're all gone

131
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:10,977
and there's no one left
to blame?

132
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,879
I really can't tell you
how exciting it is

133
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:15,782
to roll up my sleeves again
and delve into someone's psyche.

134
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:17,216
I don't even
 know where to begin

135
00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:19,719
Although, you know,
I do think it's
particularly salient

136
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:21,220
that the father never showed any interest

137
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,723
in the things that were
most important to his son.

138
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:25,725
Sounds good, Fras. Bye.

139
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:27,627
Oh. Hey, Martin.

140
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:30,063
Oh, hi, Kenny.

141
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:31,931
I didn't know you were here.

142
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:33,299


How's it going?

143
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:34,801
Okay, I guess.

144
00:05:38,304 --> 00:05:41,808
I have an emotionally
crippled father.

145
00:05:42,308 --> 00:05:43,810
You don't say.

146
00:05:45,778 --> 00:05:47,113
So where are you headed?

147
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:48,915
Uh, gonna grab a beer
at McGinty's.

148
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:50,350
Really?

149
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:54,207
Well, I'm sure dehydrated after all that crying.

150
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:04,464
You mind if I tag along
with you?

151
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:06,265
(elevator bell dings)
Sure, why not?

152
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:07,734
Oh, thanks, Martin

153
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:09,769
I really appreciate it

154
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:11,771
(cries):
I bet you were a great dad.

155
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:13,773
Oh, geez.

156
00:06:16,275 --> 00:06:17,744
If you want to learn yoga,

157
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:20,246
why do we need some
fancy private teacher?

158
00:06:20,246 --> 00:06:23,116
There are classes we could take
together down at the Y.

159
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:24,450
Yes, and afterwards

160
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:26,953
there are anti-fungal lotions
we can use together, too.

161
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:30,022
Just give Ahmrit a chance.

162
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:32,525
If we don't achieve physical and spiritual harmony,

163
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:33,493
the second lesson's free

164
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:35,962
Oh, hello, you two.

165
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:36,963
Hey, Frasier.
Hi.

166
00:06:37,463 --> 00:06:40,967
Ooh, Freud,
Bettelheim... Jung?

167
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:42,902
Someone's playing
with the big boys.

168
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:45,138
Yes, well, it's for my patient

169
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:46,539
You're seeing patients again?

170
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:49,409
Well, just this one
for the last three weeks.

171
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,778
Very challenging case, too.

172
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:54,280
The man has father issues,
any number of neuroses

173
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:56,649
and a phobia or two.

174
00:06:56,949 --> 00:06:58,484
Sounds to me like you've hit the crackpot.

175
00:06:58,484 --> 00:07:01,154
(chuckling)

176
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:02,655
I'm sorry.

177
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:04,607
I heard it at a convention.

178
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:08,194
So how did you meet
this new patient?

179
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:09,495
Well, I can't really say, Daphne.

180
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:12,331
You know, doctor-patient
confidentiality...

181
00:07:12,331 --> 00:07:14,333
Hey, shrink buddy!

182
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:15,835
Hi, Niles.
Hi, Daphne.

183
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:17,336
Hello, Kenny, how are you?
Hello.

184
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:20,840
Well, if you'll excuse us,we're off to buy sticky mats

185
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,809
All right.
There we go.

186
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:24,343
Kenny, have a seat,
have a seat.

187
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:26,846
So, how are you feeling?

188
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:28,347
Like a new man

189
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:29,682
Last night was just what I needed.

190
00:07:29,682 --> 00:07:32,452
I can't tell you how gratifying it is to hear that.

191
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:35,188
Yeah, me and your dad
shut down McGinty's.

192
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:37,457
Really? You and Dad?

193
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:39,258
Yeah, actually, I'm meeting him here for coffee.

194
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:40,760
Man, is he a hoot.

195
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,662
He made me completely forget
about my problems.

196
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:44,030
Well, good for you.

197
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:45,798
Of course...

198
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:48,601
the object is not to forget
about one's problems;

199
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:50,536
it's to understand them.

200
00:07:50,536 --> 00:07:53,372
Of course, that can take
a lot of work.

201
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:55,208
About the work part...

202
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:58,211
your dad said something last
night that made a lot of sense.

203
00:07:58,211 --> 00:07:59,712
He said I should get out more.

204
00:07:59,712 --> 00:08:01,714
And I was thinking that's going to be tough to do

205
00:08:01,714 --> 00:08:04,217
if I'm seeing you twice a week, plus doing all that homework.

206
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:06,219
I guess what
I'm saying is.

207
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:08,221
I want to quit.

208
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:09,555
Kenny...

209
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:10,857
I understand it must be painful

210
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:14,861
to uncover what is
a very painful past.

211
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:18,364
But I must warn you that
if you run away from this now

212
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:20,366
you will only be
repeating a pattern

213
00:08:20,366 --> 00:08:22,835
that will prolong
your unhappiness.

214
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:25,204
I'm okay with that.

215
00:08:25,204 --> 00:08:28,140
In these past few sessions,
we have discovered territory

216
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,142
that usually takes months
to reach.

217
00:08:30,142 --> 00:08:34,013
I don't mean to toot my own horn, but I've been on fire.

218
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:36,415
Don't get me wrong, Doc.
You've been great.

219
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:37,917
It's just... it's not for me.

220
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:38,918
Hey, guys.

221
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:41,420
Hey-Hey, it's
Party Hearty Marty!

222
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:43,055
Hey-Hey, it's, uh...

223
00:08:43,055 --> 00:08:44,123
Sir Shots-A-Lot.

224
00:08:44,123 --> 00:08:46,025
Right. Hey!

225
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,060
Dad, can I have a word
with you for a second?

226
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,128
Yeah, sure.

227
00:08:49,128 --> 00:08:50,596
Oh, I'll get
 us some coffee.

228
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:52,598
Nice guy.

229
00:08:52,598 --> 00:08:56,435
Doesn't hold his liquor like you think he would.

230
00:08:56,435 --> 00:08:58,237
Did you tell him that
he should go out more?

231
00:08:58,604 --> 00:08:59,171
Yeah. What's wrong with that?

232
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:00,540
Well...

233
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,442
he is using it as an excuse
to quit therapy.

234
00:09:03,442 --> 00:09:04,944
After one night out
with you in a bar,

235
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:09,282
the man is ready to throw away
three weeks of intense analysis.

236
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:11,117
Fras, the guy's finally having a little fun.

237
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:12,385
Don't you want
 him to be happy?

238
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:16,155
I am not trying
to make him happy.

239
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:19,592
I am trying to cure
his depression.

240
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:24,297
Hey, Marty, does this
remind you of anything?

241
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:27,300
Ow! Hot! Hot!

242
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:29,802
Get the man
some water, would you?

243
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:35,608
And breathe...

244
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:39,579
Daphne, that is
an amazing Downward Dog.

245
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,847
Thank you.

246
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,649
What about me, yogi?

247
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:46,152
How does my Downward Dog look?

248
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:48,087
Oh, dear.

249
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:51,557
Can we straighten
these legs?

250
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:52,925
Oh, I wish

251
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:54,327
Congenitally
shortened hamstrings

252
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:56,295
are the curse of the Cranes.

253
00:09:56,295 --> 00:09:58,764
Well, let's try
a different pose then.

254
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:01,267
Slowly place your left leg
between your hands

255
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,769
pivot your right heel down,
straighten your legs

256
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,271
put your left arm on your ankle.

257
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:09,275
Raise your right arm and...
triangle pose.

258
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,043
Trikonasana.

259
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:14,347
Niles, just
use a block.

260
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:15,348
I don'’ need a block.
You do.

261
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:16,849
No, I really don't.
I don't like the block.

262
00:10:16,849 --> 00:10:17,750
I don't want to touch...
Use a block.

263
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,622
And breathe...

264
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:26,125
And slowly
bring your back leg up

265
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,427
into Half-Moon pose.

266
00:10:30,162 --> 00:10:33,366
Now feel your breath
leaving your body

267
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:35,635
like a note being blown
from a flute.

268
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:36,636
.
Yes, I feel it

269
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:37,536
Great.

270
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:39,472
I'm a flute, too, yogi.

271
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,407
Yes, of course you are.

272
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:43,809
Let's straighten that leg, Niles.

273
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:44,810
Straighten it,
straighten it out.

274
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,078
Straighten it out;
there we are.

275
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:47,847
That feels good;
yeah, okay

276
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:48,848
Let's try again, Niles.

277
00:10:49,348 --> 00:10:50,349
Let's try and straighten
that leg.

278
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:52,351
You can do it.
Straighten that leg.
Marvel...

279
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:53,352
That's much better.
Okay, okay, all right.

280
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:55,354
All right, let's bend
the finger, Niles.

281
00:10:55,354 --> 00:10:57,156
Let's bend the finger.

282
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:00,860
Isn't this
wonderful, Niles?

283
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,828
I love it.

284
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:05,131
And breathe.

285
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:08,467
And be completely
in this moment.

286
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:10,970
Shut off the outside world
entirely.

287
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:11,971
(cell phone rings)

288
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:17,543
Oh, hi, Mom.

289
00:11:17,543 --> 00:11:19,545
I'm kind of in the middle of something right now.

290
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:22,548
Yes, I'm coming. I told you, I'm bringing the lentils

291
00:11:22,548 --> 00:11:24,483
What do you mean again?
You love lentils.

292
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:26,919
Niles, straighten the leg,
straighten the leg.

293
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:29,422
Okay, child's pose, that's good.

294
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:32,191
So what if Jerry
brings a different
dish to every meal

295
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:34,026
d.
It doesn't make him a go

296
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,494
Has Jerry achieved inner peace?

297
00:11:35,494 --> 00:11:38,030
I'm just asking, Mom,
has Jerry achieved inner peace?

298
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,966
I have to take this call.
Would you please excuse me?

299
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:44,403
(sighs):
That was fantastic

300
00:11:44,403 --> 00:11:45,705
I feel so energized.

301
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:48,040
Well, you are really good.

302
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,875
I hope I'm not holding you back.

303
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,011
Oh, no, you're
doing wonderfully.

304
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:53,345
He's paying you
so much attention.

305
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:55,247
I think he sees real potential.

306
00:11:55,247 --> 00:11:57,683
You don't have to soothe my ego.

307
00:11:57,683 --> 00:11:59,185
Yoga isn't about competition

308
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:01,187
it's about achieving
enlightenment

309
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:05,191
and integrating your inner
and outer lives.

310
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:13,966
Hello.

311
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,470
Well, this
is awkward.

312
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:21,474
I believe
you know Martin.

313
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:24,844
Yes,
we've already met.

314
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:27,113
Kenny, there's no reason to feel awkward.

315
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:29,582
Believe me, I have other things
to do with my evening

316
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:32,518
than to share my expertise
with someone who could use it.

317
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:34,954
Now, if you'll excuse me.

318
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:36,422
So, we still on
for McGinty's tonight?

319
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:37,456
Yeah, sure

320
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:38,958
And Kenny, I've been thinking

321
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:40,459
about what you've been going through

322
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:43,462
and I've come
up with the answer.

323
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:44,964
A suede jacket

324
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:47,466
Did you hear that?

325
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:48,968
A suede jacket!

326
00:12:49,401 --> 00:12:52,905
I must have missed that lecture
at Harvard Medical School.

327
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:56,342
You look good in it
and women love to feel it.

328
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:59,678
It's like you're a feast
for all the senses.

329
00:12:59,912 --> 00:13:02,448
I used to have a suede
coat when I was single

330
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,416
Hester made me put it away

331
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:08,420
but I'd pull it out
whenever we'd have a fight

332
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:11,357
and in a minute,
she'd be purring like a kitten

333
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:14,126
You should break
it out again.

334
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:15,461
Oh-ho! At my age?

335
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,963
It would kill me.

336
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:19,865
Hey, you got time
to do a little shopping?

337
00:13:19,865 --> 00:13:22,067
Sure. I think I got
my good credit card with me.

338
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:27,139
Leather won't cure
your problems, Kenny.

339
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:29,308
It's a temporary high.

340
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:31,110
MARTIN: Hi, guys.

341
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:32,311
NILES:
Hi.
DAPHNE:
Hello.

342
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:33,646
Oh, Niles, Daphne.

343
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:34,947
Hi, come join me.

344
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:37,716
Two low-fat lattes,
a hazelnut biscotti...

345
00:13:37,716 --> 00:13:39,218
And one blueberry scone.

346
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,153
Your brother set such a brisk pace

347
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:42,154
walking over here,

348
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,656
I could barely
keep up with him.

349
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,658
Now, Daphne, you
don't need to do that.

350
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:46,692
Why not?

351
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:48,160
Shouldn't I be proud

352
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,995
of my husband's brisk pace?

353
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:53,332
Daphne's trying
to build up my ego

354
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:54,834
because she
out-performed me at yoga.

355
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:56,235
It's not a competition.

356
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:59,672
You see? He's already
mastered the teachings.

357
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:02,007
Spiritually,
you're way ahead of me.

358
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,342
Stop it.

359
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:04,844
Frasier, wasn't
that your PatientX

360
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:06,145
that was leaving
with Dad?

361
00:14:06,145 --> 00:14:07,479
Yes, now my ex-Patient X.

362
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:08,981
Actually, I'd like
to discuss it with you

363
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:09,882
if you've got a few minutes.

364
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:11,317
Coincidentally, I just read

365
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:13,319
a fascinating paper
on early termination.

366
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:14,687
Yeah, the hypothesis was...

367
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,455
I think I'll get
something to eat.

368
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:17,756
Oh, you have
something here

369
00:14:17,756 --> 00:14:18,757
Something else.

370
00:14:18,757 --> 00:14:19,758
Well, here, try mine.

371
00:14:19,758 --> 00:14:20,759
Please, just
let me go.

372
00:14:24,263 --> 00:14:25,764
So, so, whose
decision was it

373
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:26,765
to terminate
your sessions?

374
00:14:26,765 --> 00:14:28,267
Kenny.

375
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:29,151
I see. Well, uh.

376
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,437
early individuation
can stem from anything

377
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:33,806
from transfers to delayed
adolescent rebellion.

378
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:36,442
If only it were
that complicated, Niles.

379
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:37,643
What happened?

380
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:39,044
Well, it's Dad!

381
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:41,547
He's been taking Kenny
to McGinty's every night

382
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:44,550
He's giving him therapy
in the form of beer and fun.

383
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:47,720
Poor Kenny.

384
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,154
I know.

385
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:50,522
I've got to do something

386
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:53,392
I-I-I can't just stand by while Dad undermines me.

387
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:55,761
Oh, just be careful not to turn
this into a competition.

388
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:57,563
As analysts,
we have to be above that.

389
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:58,898
ROZ:
Hey, Niles

390
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:02,868
I hear Daphne kicked
your ass at yoga.

391
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:04,870
Oh, yeah? Well, Frasier
just lost a patient.

392
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:15,447
Nice Bhujangasana, Daphne.

393
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:17,950
And yours is very nice too, Niles.

394
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:20,853
You're doing so much better this week.

395
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:22,721
Thank you. I just did
what you suggested

396
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:25,724
and imagined myself having
the reptilian sinuousness

397
00:15:25,724 --> 00:15:27,993
of a lizard scuttling
across the desert floor.

398
00:15:27,993 --> 00:15:29,662
I thought I said
rain forest.

399
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:32,097
You did, but I
don't like the damp.

400
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:35,034
This next move is a little trickier.

401
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:37,069
ne.
I'll demonstrate on Daph

402
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:39,939
First of all, bring up
your knees, like this...

403
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:43,409
Now bring your arms back
towards your ankles.

404
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:45,911
Ooh! I don't think I can do this one.

405
00:15:45,911 --> 00:15:47,413
It hurts.

406
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:48,414
Don't push.

407
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:50,849
You should be feeling
discomfort, not pain.

408
00:15:50,849 --> 00:15:56,221
If you feel pain, ease yourself
gently back towards discomfort.

409
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,190
Is it something
like this, Yogi?

410
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:00,059
(gasps)

411
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:05,464
AHMRIT:
I'm impressed, Niles.

412
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,800
you might be able to
achieve Upward Bow--

413
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,635
Urdhbadhanurasana.

414
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,070
Oh, you mean
this one?

415
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:14,907
Yes.

416
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:18,310
Oh, remind me to tell Rosa
to vacuum the sisal.

417
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,812
I'm speechless, Niles.

418
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,815
I've never seen such
a rapid improvement.

419
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,217
How do you do that?

420
00:16:25,217 --> 00:16:27,453
Oh, I think I tweaked a
muscle on that last pose.

421
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,221
Oh, no. We should put
some ice on that.

422
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:30,556
Good idea.

423
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:32,858
I guess we know who's
better at yoga now.

424
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:35,194
Now, Daphne,
there's no "better."

425
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:39,331
It's all about achieving
oneness of body and spirit.

426
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:40,499
Okay.

427
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:43,369
Now I need you
to take me to the hospital.

428
00:16:43,802 --> 00:16:44,870
What?

429
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,839
I broke my body.

430
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:49,375
I dislocated my shoulder and...

431
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:53,345
I think that one of my ribs
has achieved two-ness.

432
00:16:55,314 --> 00:16:56,682
What's going on?

433
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,651
Ahmrit and I were just going
to go out and get a chai tea.

434
00:16:59,651 --> 00:17:00,519
Can we get you one?

435
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:01,854
No, thanks.

436
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,889
You're amazing!
You have so much energy.

437
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:05,157
Ah, well...

438
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:06,992
You know what they say..

439
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:08,694
Quickly, quickly.

440
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:11,330
Imagine the pain leaving your body

441
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,531
like a wisp of smoke.

442
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:15,367
If you could get the door,
I'm starting to hemorrhage.

443
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:24,743
FRASIER:
Hello.

444
00:17:24,743 --> 00:17:25,677
Hey!

445
00:17:25,677 --> 00:17:26,745
What are you
doing here, Fras?

446
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:28,747
Just thought maybe
the three of us

447
00:17:28,747 --> 00:17:29,748
could have
a little chat.

448
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:30,749
Doc, this is Trudy.

449
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,252
Ah. Delighted,
I'm sure.

450
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:35,054
Hey.

451
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:37,456
I'd love to stay and chat, Doc,

452
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:38,957
but me and Trudy

453
00:17:38,957 --> 00:17:40,726
have a dinner date with the Colonel

454
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:43,862
Well, if you think
you're ready for that.

455
00:17:43,862 --> 00:17:44,696
Well, I'm not
hungry now,

456
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:46,498
but I probably will be when we get there.

457
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:47,766
See you guys later

458
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:49,268
Nice to meet you.

459
00:17:49,768 --> 00:17:50,769
Likewise,
I'm sure.

460
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:54,773
Have a great time!

461
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:55,774
He's doomed.

462
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:57,276
What are you
talking about?

463
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:58,777
He scored and she's a cheap date.

464
00:17:58,777 --> 00:17:59,778
Oh, Dad, please.

465
00:17:59,778 --> 00:18:01,280
He is not ready
for a relationship.

466
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,215
How could you let him
do something like that?

467
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,150
Don't blame me for that; it was the jacket.

468
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:07,152
He wasn't here ten minutes
before she wanted to touch it.

469
00:18:07,152 --> 00:18:08,087
You know what?

470
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:10,122
All you're doing
is allowing him

471
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:11,623
to wallow in his
state of denial

472
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:13,625
and what if she
rejects him, hmm?

473
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,561
The man already has
abandonment issues.

474
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,996
Oh, would you cut out the psychological mumbo-jumbo?

475
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:19,431
Let the guy have
a good time.

476
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:20,766
What did you just say?

477
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,267
I said let the guy have some fun.

478
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:23,268
No, before that.

479
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:25,137
You said "psychological
mumbo-jumbo."

480
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:27,005
So that's how you
characterize my life's work?

481
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:28,440
I'm just saying

482
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,409
that I don't think therapy is for everybody.

483
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:32,411
Like Kenny-- he just
needed to loosen up.

484
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:33,612
Oh, really?

485
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:36,448
So tell me,
Dr. Party-Hardy Marty...

486
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:42,454
Who, in your expert opinion,
does need therapy?

487
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:45,257
Well...

488
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:47,025
Hitler.

489
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:52,131
Hitler.

490
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,932
Yes, and that woman

491
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:56,935
with all the different personalities, um...

492
00:18:56,935 --> 00:18:58,437
Sybil.

493
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,140
Hitler.

494
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,574
And Sybil.

495
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:05,544
Anyone else?

496
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:08,380
No.

497
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:12,584
Great!

498
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:14,386
An entire science

499
00:19:14,386 --> 00:19:17,689
devoted to Hitler and Sybil.

500
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:19,324
Do you believe that...

501
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:21,660
that Niles and I have been
wasting our lives?

502
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,962
Do you think Mom
wasted her life?

503
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,230
Now, you calm down, Frasier.

504
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,733
I'm just saying that you overcomplicate things.

505
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:30,235
Yes, Kenny needed to
talk out some problems

506
00:19:30,235 --> 00:19:33,739
but he didn't need to analyze every moment of his childhood.

507
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:35,707
That's when it gets into the mumbo-jumbo.

508
00:19:35,707 --> 00:19:37,676
I'm just trying to get
to the root of his problems.

509
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,645
You know what? I think
you needed to give therapy

510
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:40,646
more than he needed to get it.

511
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:42,147
And you know what I think?

512
00:19:42,147 --> 00:19:43,949
I think I'm finished
listening to you.

513
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,185
All right, fine,
maybe I did enjoy it.

514
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,253
Look, it's what
I was trained to do.

515
00:19:48,253 --> 00:19:49,555
It's what I love to do

516
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:51,857
and I still think I was
doing Kenny some good.

517
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,358
Well, Frasier, you know,

518
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:54,860
Kenny's not the only one with mental problems.

519
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,295
And what is that
supposed to mean?

520
00:19:56,662 --> 00:19:59,131
Well, it means you can start
seeing other patients.

521
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:00,499
Oh, right, right.

522
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:02,301
Well, I've, I've thought
about that.

523
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:04,503
Why not, if you love it?

524
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:07,406
You know, perhaps I could
start seeing people

525
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:08,907
a couple of nights a week.

526
00:20:08,907 --> 00:20:12,244
I could even convert Daphne's
old room into an office.

527
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:14,580
Well, if you do,
while they're waiting,

528
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:17,015
they're watching
what I want to watch

529
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:19,418
Hey, guys.

530
00:20:19,418 --> 00:20:20,419
Kenny!
Kenny!

531
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:21,420
What happened?

532
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,387
Are you
all right?

533
00:20:22,921 --> 00:20:24,423
I don't think Trudy
and I are a fit.

534
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:26,391
When we got to the parking lot,

535
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:28,727
her boyfriend pushed me down
and took my jacket.

536
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:29,528
Aw...

537
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:30,963
MARTIN:
I'm sorry.

538
00:20:30,963 --> 00:20:33,365
I feel like such a loser.

539
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:34,866
No, you're not a loser

540
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:37,369
and if you need
to talk about this-

541
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:39,771
Frasier's pretty good at this sort of thing.

542
00:20:39,771 --> 00:20:43,041
Well, Kenny, I tell you what.

543
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:44,876
Whenever you're
ready, okay?

544
00:20:44,876 --> 00:20:47,379
For the time being,
why don't you

545
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:50,382
let a couple of buddies
get you a beer, okay?

546
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:51,850
Thanks.

547
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,318
You know,
it's too bad that Trudy

548
00:20:53,318 --> 00:20:55,320
was just setting me up
to get mugged

549
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,322
because up to that point,
we were really cooking.

550
00:20:57,322 --> 00:20:59,825
