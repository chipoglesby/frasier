1
00:00:11,777 --> 00:00:14,410
Oh, good morning, Dr. Crane.

2
00:00:15,771 --> 00:00:17,566
Not a morning person, are we?

3
00:00:17,567 --> 00:00:20,134
Well, never you mind. I am.

4
00:00:20,508 --> 00:00:24,271
Can't very well be a good health care provider if you're not up with the cock.

5
00:00:26,312 --> 00:00:29,555
I've already taken your father for his morning constitutional.

6
00:00:29,896 --> 00:00:34,001
Such a remarkable man - thirty years on the police force.

7
00:00:34,002 --> 00:00:36,504
I can understand why you'd want him to live here,

8
00:00:36,505 --> 00:00:38,804
although not many sons would do that,

9
00:00:38,805 --> 00:00:40,724
not without getting paid for it.

10
00:00:41,143 --> 00:00:44,651
Anyway, coffee's made, and I took the liberty of doing a shop.

11
00:00:44,933 --> 00:00:47,748
They don't serve much tripe in Seattle, do they?

12
00:00:49,946 --> 00:00:50,983
And you are...?

13
00:00:53,876 --> 00:00:56,374
Daphne. Daphne Moon.

14
00:00:56,375 --> 00:00:58,055
I moved in yesterday.

15
00:00:58,056 --> 00:01:00,358
- You hired me to take care of your father.
- Of course

16
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:04,098
Of course. You'll have to forgive me, I'm not quite myself until I've shaved and showered.

17
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:05,222
Oh, yes

18
00:01:05,223 --> 00:01:08,917
I completely understand about one's morning ablutions.

19
00:01:08,918 --> 00:01:13,823
- I, for instance, can't stand myself 'til I floss all that gunk out of my teeth...
- Miss Moon!

20
00:01:16,194 --> 00:01:21,091
For future reference, if you could just keep your ablutions on a need-to know basis?

21
00:01:21,554 --> 00:01:22,562
Thank you

22
00:01:22,857 --> 00:01:24,154
Now, my coffee.

23
00:01:24,812 --> 00:01:27,662
The half 'n half's curdled, and the garbage disposal's jammed.

24
00:01:28,649 --> 00:01:29,904
Good morning to you too, dad.

25
00:01:30,574 --> 00:01:32,127
Morning was two hours ago.

26
00:01:33,252 --> 00:01:35,795
And close that barn door, we got a lady in the house now.

27
00:01:38,128 --> 00:01:39,683
Hey, this isn't my coffee.

28
00:01:39,852 --> 00:01:42,613
Where's my finely-ground Kenya blend from Starbucks?

29
00:01:42,614 --> 00:01:43,689
That's it.

30
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:46,300
Daphne put an eggshell and some allspice in it.

31
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,939
Didn't that just dress it up?

32
00:01:51,473 --> 00:01:53,988
I like it. Gives it a zing.

33
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:57,331
Now, come on, sit down. Your breakfast is ready.

34
00:01:57,332 --> 00:02:00,893
Oh, no, dad, dad, look, all I ever have is a bran muffin, and a touch of yogurt.

35
00:02:00,894 --> 00:02:02,248
Ah, girlie food.

36
00:02:03,474 --> 00:02:05,206
Besides, I already fixed your breakfast.

37
00:02:05,207 --> 00:02:06,664
Now, I made you "Eggs in a nest".

38
00:02:06,665 --> 00:02:09,179
Ah yes, the Crane family specialty.

39
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:11,303
Fried eggs swimming in fat,

40
00:02:11,669 --> 00:02:14,418
served in a delightfully hollowed-out piece of white bread.

41
00:02:14,419 --> 00:02:17,625
I can almost hear my left ventricle slamming shut as I speak.

42
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:21,643
- You want cheese on that?
- No

43
00:02:22,724 --> 00:02:26,790
I'd like to leave some blood flow for the clot to go swiftly to my brain.

44
00:02:30,996 --> 00:02:33,476
Can't have my coffee, can't have my breakfast.

45
00:02:35,594 --> 00:02:37,284
Oh dear god, it wasn't a dream.

46
00:02:40,366 --> 00:02:41,512
I'll get him for this.

47
00:02:42,045 --> 00:02:43,743
And his little dog, too.

48
00:02:49,526 --> 00:02:52,315
Where's my paper? Who's stole my paper?

49
00:02:52,316 --> 00:02:54,736
Mrs. Everly, you old bat, I know it's you!

50
00:02:55,129 --> 00:02:59,593
Yoo-hoo? It's right here, we brought it in for you.

51
00:03:00,883 --> 00:03:02,391
Sorry, sorry.

52
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:06,062
Oh, wait a minute, this...

53
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,987
where's the rubber band? This paper has been read.

54
00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:11,350
Well, don't worry, we won't tell you what's in it.

55
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:15,733
That is not the point.

56
00:03:16,143 --> 00:03:19,486
Dad, dad? Come and sit down please, would you?

57
00:03:20,393 --> 00:03:22,140
You're going to give a speech, aren't you?

58
00:03:22,643 --> 00:03:24,375
Oh, that's right, I forgot, you're psychic.

59
00:03:26,815 --> 00:03:29,377
Yes, but I think anyone could feel this one coming on.

60
00:03:30,925 --> 00:03:32,099
Let us get something clear.

61
00:03:33,132 --> 00:03:34,807
I am not a morning person.

62
00:03:35,814 --> 00:03:37,989
I have to ease into my day slowly.

63
00:03:38,888 --> 00:03:40,382
First I have my coffee

64
00:03:41,105 --> 00:03:44,670
sans eggshells or anything else one tends to pick out of the garbage.

65
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:50,109
Then I have a low-fat, high-fiber breakfast.

66
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:54,049
Finally I sit down and read a crisp, new newspaper.

67
00:03:54,459 --> 00:03:59,705
If I am robbed of the richness of my morning routine, I cannot function.

68
00:04:00,034 --> 00:04:01,182
My radio show suffers,

69
00:04:01,417 --> 00:04:05,915
and like ripples in a pond, so do the many listeners that rely on my advice,

70
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:08,440
to help them through their troubled lives.

71
00:04:08,441 --> 00:04:10,001
I'm sorry if this may sound priggish,

72
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,264
but have grown comfortable with this part of myself.

73
00:04:13,534 --> 00:04:15,739
It is the magic that is me.

74
00:04:19,673 --> 00:04:21,110
Get used to it.

75
00:04:23,239 --> 00:04:25,308
I know the is a stressful time,

76
00:04:25,309 --> 00:04:27,027
and this is new for all of us,

77
00:04:27,028 --> 00:04:30,360
but I'm sure that soon we'll all be getting along swimmingly.

78
00:04:31,077 --> 00:04:33,877
- Ooh, six more weeks of winter, I see.
- Oh, dear.

79
00:04:55,427 --> 00:04:56,802
Down Eddie, down.

80
00:05:00,043 --> 00:05:01,097
I said down.

81
00:05:02,868 --> 00:05:04,127
Good boy Eddie, just get down.

82
00:05:04,128 --> 00:05:06,462
Good good good good good, Eddie get down.

83
00:05:06,565 --> 00:05:07,738
GET DOWN!

84
00:05:09,602 --> 00:05:13,492
Dad, dad, I can't read my paper, Eddie's staring at me.

85
00:05:14,679 --> 00:05:16,895
Why, you do make quite a picture in the morning.

86
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,264
- Just ignore him.
- I'm trying to.

87
00:05:20,265 --> 00:05:21,786
I'm talking to the dog.

88
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:49,417
Don't even think about it!

89
00:05:53,828 --> 00:05:55,894
You're listening to Dr. Frasier Crane.

90
00:05:56,152 --> 00:05:58,156
Our topic today is...

91
00:05:58,157 --> 00:05:59,602
intrusion.

92
00:06:01,548 --> 00:06:05,238
Those who encroach on our sense of personal space.

93
00:06:05,747 --> 00:06:08,179
The neighbor who plays his stereo too loud.

94
00:06:08,678 --> 00:06:12,366
The person who sits next to you in the movie theater when there are fifty other vacant seats.

95
00:06:13,191 --> 00:06:14,971
Now let's return to our calls,

96
00:06:15,655 --> 00:06:20,733
and let me remind you once more, that our topic today is intrusion.

97
00:06:21,788 --> 00:06:23,922
since so many of you seem to be forgetting that.

98
00:06:24,922 --> 00:06:28,198
Dr. Crane, we have Leonard from Everett, on line two.

99
00:06:29,428 --> 00:06:31,239
Hello Leonard, I'm listening.

100
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,593
Oh, hi, Dr. Crane.

101
00:06:32,594 --> 00:06:35,039
Ah, I'm a little nervous, but ah...

102
00:06:35,538 --> 00:06:36,718
well, here goes.

103
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:40,735
Several years ago I became afraid of large, open spaces.

104
00:06:40,736 --> 00:06:43,935
Like, if I went to the mall, I'd break out in a cold sweat.

105
00:06:43,936 --> 00:06:45,676
I'd get so scared that I'd have to run home.

106
00:06:46,024 --> 00:06:48,445
Yes Leonard, and your comments on intrusion?

107
00:06:50,568 --> 00:06:51,010
Nothing.

108
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:53,664
Just that, now I'm afraid to go outside at all.

109
00:06:54,047 --> 00:06:56,481
I haven't seen another person in eight months.

110
00:06:56,868 --> 00:07:01,602
Well Leonard, it sounds like you may have a very serious condition known as agoraphobia.

111
00:07:02,006 --> 00:07:03,192
But you're not alone.

112
00:07:04,029 --> 00:07:05,458
But I am alone, Dr. Crane.

113
00:07:10,514 --> 00:07:14,498
Listen Leonard, I'm afraid your problem is too difficult to deal with in the time we have remaining,

114
00:07:14,499 --> 00:07:19,120
so if you stay on the line, someone will give you the name of a qualified therapist.

115
00:07:19,626 --> 00:07:21,538
Well, that's all the time we have for today.

116
00:07:21,819 --> 00:07:26,566
You've been listening to Dr. Frasier Crane, KACL 780.

117
00:07:26,567 --> 00:07:27,607
Stay tuned for the news.

118
00:07:27,608 --> 00:07:33,557
Then next up, Bob "Bulldog" Briscoe and the Gonzo Sports Show.

119
00:07:33,558 --> 00:07:35,066
I never miss it.

120
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:36,606
Yeah, right.

121
00:07:40,355 --> 00:07:41,622
You want your messages?

122
00:07:42,046 --> 00:07:44,823
Oh, listen Roz, just hang on to them. I think I'll stay in here for a while.

123
00:07:45,358 --> 00:07:49,001
Today more that most, I feel an overwhelming need for solitude.

124
00:07:49,002 --> 00:07:51,391
I've got a fascinating book here, a confortable chair...

125
00:07:51,392 --> 00:07:53,734
and a soundproof booth.

126
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,276
Hiya, doc, How're they hangin'?

127
00:08:00,277 --> 00:08:02,143
Bulldog, what are you doing here?

128
00:08:02,144 --> 00:08:04,201
We lost transmitter link power in Studio C.

129
00:08:04,202 --> 00:08:05,655
I gotta do my show from here.

130
00:08:10,348 --> 00:08:14,908
Hey, where the hell's my Cosell tape? Somebody stole my Cosell tape!

131
00:08:15,151 --> 00:08:18,449
THIS STINKS! THIS IS TOTAL B.S.! THIS... Oh, here it is.

132
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,913
Let me just get out of your way.

133
00:08:22,914 --> 00:08:24,013
Oh, by the way doc,

134
00:08:24,014 --> 00:08:28,847
doc, I heard what you said to that kid who fantasizes about killing his parents?

135
00:08:29,713 --> 00:08:30,745
You know what I would have told him?

136
00:08:31,283 --> 00:08:32,834
Sports.

137
00:08:32,966 --> 00:08:34,997
You go out there, break some heads

138
00:08:35,773 --> 00:08:36,862
That'll turn him around.

139
00:08:37,722 --> 00:08:41,495
Yes. If only Jeffrey Dahmer had picked up a squash racquet.

140
00:08:42,212 --> 00:08:45,883
Hey, where the hell's my Lasorda tape? THIS IS TOT... ah, got it.

141
00:08:47,993 --> 00:08:49,906
Hold on a second, I have to ask you something.

142
00:08:50,926 --> 00:08:54,231
Gary? I broke up with him three weeks ago.

143
00:08:54,538 --> 00:08:57,577
The sex was okay, but he was kinda limited.

144
00:08:58,624 --> 00:08:59,246
No, no.

145
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:00,940
No, it wasn't that Gary was bad in bed.

146
00:09:00,941 --> 00:09:02,872
I mean, he knew where all the parts were.

147
00:09:02,873 --> 00:09:04,964
Unfortunately, most of them were his.

148
00:09:06,425 --> 00:09:10,772
Yes, totally passionless, it was like he was thinking of someone else.

149
00:09:10,773 --> 00:09:12,194
I know I was.

150
00:09:14,211 --> 00:09:16,058
Somebody's here, I gotta go.

151
00:09:16,059 --> 00:09:17,409
Alright? Talk to you later.

152
00:09:17,632 --> 00:09:18,820
Bye Mom.

153
00:09:21,638 --> 00:09:22,806
That was your mother?

154
00:09:22,807 --> 00:09:23,792
Yeah, why?

155
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:25,752
You talk to your mother like that?

156
00:09:25,753 --> 00:09:26,992
Well, we're both adults.

157
00:09:26,993 --> 00:09:28,474
We talk about everything.

158
00:09:29,174 --> 00:09:30,300
Well, isn't that healthy.

159
00:09:30,816 --> 00:09:32,641
What, you don't talk to your dad like that?

160
00:09:32,642 --> 00:09:35,280
Oh, hardly. We hardly speak at all.

161
00:09:35,281 --> 00:09:36,175
Really?

162
00:09:36,395 --> 00:09:37,793
Ah yes, well you know, we're just not really...

163
00:09:38,593 --> 00:09:39,951
very similar people

164
00:09:39,952 --> 00:09:43,142
In fact, my brother and I are a lot more like my mother.

165
00:09:43,551 --> 00:09:45,984
You know, if it wasn't biologically impossible

166
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:48,923
I'd swear that dad was dropped in a basket on our doorstep.

167
00:09:51,389 --> 00:09:53,603
Hey sweetcakes, you seen my engineer?

168
00:09:53,745 --> 00:09:55,544
I think someone's talking to you, Frasier.

169
00:09:55,545 --> 00:09:57,136
Come on, come on, come on!

170
00:09:57,913 --> 00:10:00,056
Yes, he called and he'll be right here.

171
00:10:00,815 --> 00:10:04,016
So do you want to go across the street and have one of those expensive coffee drinks?

172
00:10:04,777 --> 00:10:06,228
Maybe some other time.

173
00:10:06,229 --> 00:10:09,217
Right now, I'd like to continue my quest for solitude.

174
00:10:09,218 --> 00:10:14,513
I'll go somewhere my father, Mary Poppins and the hound from hell can't find me.

175
00:10:16,179 --> 00:10:21,288
I think maybe I'll just go sit under the shade of a tree and read in a quiet park.

176
00:10:26,895 --> 00:10:28,454
Hello.

177
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:33,715
Hello?

178
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:35,823
Dad?

179
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:38,099
Daphne?

180
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:41,258
Eddie?

181
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,757
Could it be?

182
00:11:12,594 --> 00:11:14,418
Toreador

183
00:11:14,419 --> 00:11:15,717
Don't spit on the floor.

184
00:11:16,665 --> 00:11:18,163
Use the cuspidor-a

185
00:11:18,413 --> 00:11:20,379
What do you think it's for-a?

186
00:11:32,695 --> 00:11:35,622
...so the elephant says, "He's with me."

187
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:41,171
Oh, Dr. Crane, you're home.

188
00:11:41,172 --> 00:11:43,615
We just got back from your father's physical therapy.

189
00:11:43,616 --> 00:11:45,839
Oh, glory be. Oh, happy day.

190
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,808
Not that I'm not delighted to see the two of you,

191
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:51,108
it's just that I'm in the middle of a very exciting chapter.

192
00:11:51,478 --> 00:11:52,746
Ooh, I understand.

193
00:11:52,981 --> 00:11:56,370
So why don't I pop into the kitchen and brew you up a nice pot of tea?

194
00:11:56,371 --> 00:11:58,725
No, I just poured myself a glass of wine, thank you.

195
00:11:59,681 --> 00:12:00,893
I see.

196
00:12:09,233 --> 00:12:10,234
Whatcha reading?

197
00:12:10,786 --> 00:12:12,326
Oh dad, you wouldn't find it very interesting.

198
00:12:12,538 --> 00:12:14,179
I might. Any good?

199
00:12:14,646 --> 00:12:16,540
Well, I haven't formed an opinion yet.

200
00:12:17,001 --> 00:12:19,743
Oddly enough, I'm having a little trouble getting into it.

201
00:12:27,768 --> 00:12:29,458
Thick.

202
00:12:31,322 --> 00:12:32,481
Dad will you...

203
00:12:33,393 --> 00:12:34,978
Listen, I don't want to offend, but...

204
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,939
if you wouldn't mind, could you just

205
00:12:37,743 --> 00:12:39,258
leave me alone, let me read my book?

206
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:40,260
No problem.

207
00:12:50,765 --> 00:12:51,487
What are you doing?

208
00:12:51,488 --> 00:12:52,505
I'm leaving you alone.

209
00:12:52,506 --> 00:12:53,402
Well, it's very annoying!

210
00:12:53,403 --> 00:12:55,972
Ah, what's your problem?

211
00:12:55,973 --> 00:12:57,923
You've been sucking a lemon all week.

212
00:12:57,924 --> 00:12:59,445
All right, all right, I'll tell you what my problem is,

213
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:01,254
I can't get a moment's peace alone in my own house.

214
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:03,001
Well, forgive me.

215
00:13:03,002 --> 00:13:05,091
When you invited me to move in I didn't realise

216
00:13:05,092 --> 00:13:07,400
I had to stay chained to the radiator in my room.

217
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:09,899
Perhaps only evenings.

218
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:10,936
I heard that!

219
00:13:10,937 --> 00:13:13,411
Well, of course you heard it, you're never out of earshot!

220
00:13:13,412 --> 00:13:15,271
Ah, you know, you've always been like this.

221
00:13:15,272 --> 00:13:16,616
You were always a fussy little kid,

222
00:13:16,617 --> 00:13:18,023
and it's gotten worse ever since.

223
00:13:18,251 --> 00:13:20,055
You and your precious morning routine.

224
00:13:20,364 --> 00:13:21,626
You gotta have your coffee,

225
00:13:21,627 --> 00:13:22,770
you gotta have your quiet,

226
00:13:22,771 --> 00:13:24,516
you gotta have this, you gotta have that.

227
00:13:24,866 --> 00:13:26,799
Well, aren't you the little hothouse orchid.

228
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,108
Hey, hey-hey-hey!

229
00:13:28,876 --> 00:13:30,589
I don't have to sit here and listen to that!

230
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:31,886
Ah, if you want everything so perfect,

231
00:13:31,887 --> 00:13:33,331
why don't you go live in a bubble?

232
00:13:33,332 --> 00:13:36,079
Oh right, oh well, right now it sounds very inviting!

233
00:13:41,505 --> 00:13:43,932
Finally, a little peace and quiet around here.

234
00:13:52,654 --> 00:13:54,761
Hello there, Frasier.

235
00:13:54,762 --> 00:13:56,790
Oh, what fresh hell is this?

236
00:14:01,068 --> 00:14:02,680
That's a nice way to greet your brother.

237
00:14:04,029 --> 00:14:05,909
Café latte, per piachere.

238
00:14:06,974 --> 00:14:07,914
I'm sorry, Niles,

239
00:14:07,915 --> 00:14:10,108
It's just I've been trying to read this book

240
00:14:10,109 --> 00:14:12,323
and it seems no matter where I alight I get interrupted.

241
00:14:12,656 --> 00:14:15,206
Oh, "The Holotropic Mind" by Stanislav Grolf.

242
00:14:15,731 --> 00:14:19,554
I love his conclusion that a change in breathing patterns can induce alternate states of consciousness.

243
00:14:19,555 --> 00:14:21,347
Great. Now you've ruined the ending!

244
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,308
I'm sorry, that was inconsiderate.

245
00:14:27,142 --> 00:14:28,203
Mille Grazie.

246
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:33,972
So, how's father?

247
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:34,584
Father?

248
00:14:34,585 --> 00:14:36,179
You mean the man who's driving me crazy?

249
00:14:36,693 --> 00:14:38,814
The man who makes me dread the sight of my very doorstep?

250
00:14:38,815 --> 00:14:40,849
The man who just drove me out of my own home?

251
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:42,185
And how's work?

252
00:14:45,306 --> 00:14:46,968
Niles, I don't know what I'm going to do.

253
00:14:47,974 --> 00:14:50,192
Dad and I had another fight.

254
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:53,564
I'm afraid if we stay under the same roof together

255
00:14:53,565 --> 00:14:56,881
we'll do irreparable harm to the relationship we have as it is.

256
00:14:57,484 --> 00:14:58,892
Well, what are the alternatives?

257
00:15:01,474 --> 00:15:03,417
Well, if I didn't fell so guilty I'd,

258
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:05,731
I'd do what I should have done in the first place:

259
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:08,595
just move dad and Daphne into their own appartment.

260
00:15:08,596 --> 00:15:10,142
Oh, for goodness sake, Frasier.

261
00:15:10,143 --> 00:15:11,933
It hasn't been that long, you have to give it a chance.

262
00:15:12,526 --> 00:15:14,882
And you might remember why you moved him in in the first place.

263
00:15:15,383 --> 00:15:16,407
Refresh me.

264
00:15:17,024 --> 00:15:18,680
You wanted to get closer to dad.

265
00:15:18,681 --> 00:15:19,906
I still do.

266
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:21,835
There isn't anything I'd like more,

267
00:15:21,836 --> 00:15:22,960
but he makes it impossible.

268
00:15:22,961 --> 00:15:24,675
I can't read my book, I can't have my coffee,

269
00:15:24,676 --> 00:15:26,520
I can't have any peace in my own home.

270
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:28,833
So what you're saying is, you want to be closer to dad,

271
00:15:28,834 --> 00:15:30,468
but you don't actually want him around.

272
00:15:35,741 --> 00:15:39,533
Ask yourself Frasier, have you tried to sit down and talk to him

273
00:15:39,534 --> 00:15:41,616
I mean, really talk to him?

274
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:44,082
Well, I...

275
00:15:45,631 --> 00:15:48,448
Maybe I haven't done my best.

276
00:15:50,748 --> 00:15:53,306
I guess I owe that to the old man, don't I?

277
00:15:55,241 --> 00:15:56,251
Well, ah...

278
00:15:58,134 --> 00:16:00,417
Thanks for the chat, Niles. You're a good brother,

279
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:02,770
and a credit to the psychiatric profession.

280
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,572
You're a good brother too.

281
00:16:11,441 --> 00:16:12,550
Daphne?

282
00:16:13,725 --> 00:16:15,277
What are my things doing here?

283
00:16:15,278 --> 00:16:17,417
My leather wing chair? My Kusami lamp?

284
00:16:17,418 --> 00:16:19,847
We're putting them in the storage room, in the basement.

285
00:16:20,184 --> 00:16:23,568
There was no room for them in the study once we got my furniture in.

286
00:16:23,569 --> 00:16:25,688
We discussed it last night, remember?

287
00:16:25,689 --> 00:16:26,684
Of course, of course.

288
00:16:27,045 --> 00:16:30,723
I was just on my way to ask that peculiar little man from building services

289
00:16:30,724 --> 00:16:32,367
to give me a hand moving them.

290
00:16:32,368 --> 00:16:34,562
Oh, yes, Kyle. Well, give him my regards.

291
00:16:34,563 --> 00:16:36,646
Oh yeah, Remind me again

292
00:16:36,961 --> 00:16:39,547
which one of Kyle's eyes is really looking at me?

293
00:16:41,944 --> 00:16:42,962
The brown one.

294
00:16:54,508 --> 00:16:56,648
Daphne left your dinner in the fridge, if you're hungry.

295
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:58,283
Well thanks, but I'm not.

296
00:16:58,284 --> 00:17:05,290
Ah... Dad, I'm sorry about the blow-up earlier.

297
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:07,473
Ah, forget about it. I already have.

298
00:17:07,763 --> 00:17:11,120
You know, I guess there's no secret that these's been a lot of tension between us,

299
00:17:11,121 --> 00:17:14,565
and I think maybe one of the reasons is that we never have a chance to sit down and talk.

300
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:19,036
And I... I thought we might have a conversation.

301
00:17:19,037 --> 00:17:19,927
Right now?

302
00:17:20,822 --> 00:17:22,763
Yes, I think now would be a good time.

303
00:17:23,058 --> 00:17:24,356
Later would be better.

304
00:17:26,006 --> 00:17:27,710
It doesn't have to be a long, drawn-out conversation,

305
00:17:27,711 --> 00:17:29,780
I'm talking about three minutes of you life.

306
00:17:29,781 --> 00:17:31,585
Well, I hope it is only three minutes,

307
00:17:31,586 --> 00:17:32,962
'cause my program's coming on.

308
00:17:32,963 --> 00:17:33,749
Well, alright.

309
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:38,314
If it'll make you any happier I will get the egg-timer and I will set it for three minutes.

310
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:41,859
So, what do you want to talk about?

311
00:17:42,382 --> 00:17:46,587
Well, the idea is for us to have a normal, honest conversation

312
00:17:46,588 --> 00:17:49,344
just like two normal people without getting on each other's nerves.

313
00:17:52,449 --> 00:17:57,880
Ready? Go

314
00:17:58,568 --> 00:17:59,754
This is stupid.

315
00:18:00,378 --> 00:18:02,790
One second? That's our personal best?

316
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:10,535
Let us see if we can beat it.

317
00:18:12,327 --> 00:18:14,787
Ready? Go

318
00:18:17,802 --> 00:18:20,071
So how about those Seahawks?

319
00:18:20,072 --> 00:18:21,102
No sports.

320
00:18:21,103 --> 00:18:22,692
- All right. No opera.
- Agreed.

321
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:30,027
Ready? Go

322
00:18:33,455 --> 00:18:35,684
This is your idea, you say something first.

323
00:18:37,295 --> 00:18:39,745
Alright, alright. I'll, I'll tell you something about myself,

324
00:18:39,746 --> 00:18:41,825
that, ah, that you don't know.

325
00:18:42,937 --> 00:18:44,059
Ah, six months ago,

326
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:49,055
when Lilith and I were really on the rocks, ah,

327
00:18:49,832 --> 00:18:53,284
there was a time of depression I went through that was so terrible

328
00:18:53,285 --> 00:18:59,971
I actually climbed out on a ledge and wondered if life was worth living. I...

329
00:19:00,756 --> 00:19:04,033
And then I thought of Frederick.

330
00:19:04,732 --> 00:19:06,322
And you didn't jump, huh?

331
00:19:13,072 --> 00:19:14,197
Good, dad.

332
00:19:15,694 --> 00:19:17,557
Wow. I never knew that.

333
00:19:17,558 --> 00:19:19,817
Well, that's the point of this whole experiment.

334
00:19:19,818 --> 00:19:23,297
To tell one another something that we don't know about each other.

335
00:19:23,728 --> 00:19:26,232
Something vulnerable. Now it's your turn.

336
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:28,253
Okay.

337
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,904
Well, about two months ago,

338
00:19:32,395 --> 00:19:35,590
I was in the basement, going through some old pictures of your mother and me...

339
00:19:36,205 --> 00:19:38,373
and all of the sudden something flew up in my eye.

340
00:19:39,155 --> 00:19:41,738
And, when I was trying to get it out,

341
00:19:41,739 --> 00:19:46,065
I realised I could turn my eyelid inside out, the way kids do at camp.

342
00:19:48,285 --> 00:19:50,892
That's it? You call that vulnerable?

343
00:19:50,893 --> 00:19:51,815
It hurt.

344
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:52,816
Oh well...

345
00:19:53,229 --> 00:19:55,237
I'm not talking about that kind of pain,

346
00:19:55,238 --> 00:19:58,185
I'm talking about your emotions, your soul.

347
00:19:58,482 --> 00:20:01,711
Some sort of painful, gut- wrenching experience.

348
00:20:01,712 --> 00:20:02,671
Other than this one?

349
00:20:02,672 --> 00:20:04,599
Oh, God! Always the flip answer.

350
00:20:05,351 --> 00:20:06,899
Well, this whole thing's stupid.

351
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,054
Well, not to me.

352
00:20:08,055 --> 00:20:09,813
Oh, how should I expect anything out of you?

353
00:20:09,814 --> 00:20:13,844
You are the most cold, intractable, unapproachable, distant,

354
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:16,356
stubborn, cold man I've ever known!

355
00:20:16,357 --> 00:20:18,077
You said "cold" twice, Mr. Egghead.

356
00:20:18,078 --> 00:20:19,250
Egghead? Egghead?

357
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:20,704
You said "egghead" twice, too.

358
00:20:20,705 --> 00:20:22,437
Oh, you are so infuriating!

359
00:20:22,438 --> 00:20:23,935
Oh, you're no day at the beach either.

360
00:20:23,936 --> 00:20:24,972
You know what you are?

361
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:27,347
I'll tell you later, it's time for my program.

362
00:20:33,342 --> 00:20:36,416
Dad, I don't think you see how serious this is.

363
00:20:36,417 --> 00:20:37,921
Oh, will you give it a rest?

364
00:20:38,052 --> 00:20:40,724
Look. We're not getting alone, and it's not getting any better.

365
00:20:43,349 --> 00:20:46,167
I'm not sure how to say this, but ah...

366
00:20:46,976 --> 00:20:51,604
I ah, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to...

367
00:20:51,986 --> 00:20:53,574
I know what you're trying to say.

368
00:20:53,575 --> 00:20:55,639
"You want what's best for both of us."

369
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:58,704
You want to get me out of here, then you can have your own space,

370
00:20:58,705 --> 00:21:01,997
and I'll have my own space, and we can put an end to all this bickering.

371
00:21:03,284 --> 00:21:04,291
Well, yes.

372
00:21:05,665 --> 00:21:07,272
I guess it wasn't so hard to say after all.

373
00:21:07,273 --> 00:21:09,836
Except for one thing. I'm not going.

374
00:21:10,049 --> 00:21:11,082
What?

375
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:14,002
Look, you want us to forge some great father-son relationship,

376
00:21:14,003 --> 00:21:15,390
to make some connection.

377
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:19,149
Well, that kind of thing takes a couple of years, not a couple of days, doesn't it?

378
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:20,613
You're the shrink.

379
00:21:22,255 --> 00:21:23,750
Couple of years, huh?

380
00:21:23,751 --> 00:21:25,634
Ah, it'll go by before you know it.

381
00:21:26,861 --> 00:21:29,340
Either that, or it'll seem like eternity.

382
00:21:36,679 --> 00:21:38,651
I'm willing to give it a shot if you are.

383
00:21:41,178 --> 00:21:42,374
Okay

384
00:21:42,556 --> 00:21:45,412
Great. How about you and me having a beer together?

385
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:50,531
Wow. You know, in all these years you've never asked me that.

386
00:21:51,568 --> 00:21:52,975
I'd love to have a beer with you, dad.

387
00:21:52,976 --> 00:21:56,002
Well then, you better haul ass, 'cause the store closes in ten minutes.

388
00:21:56,003 --> 00:21:57,187
Right.
