1
00:00:07,966 --> 00:00:11,925
Danielle, slow down a little bit.
l can't understand you.

2
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:17,211
'l have a problem with my monthieur.'

3
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,751
- With your what?
- 'My monthieur.'

4
00:00:21,062 --> 00:00:22,620
Your monthieur?

5
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:25,290
'Oui, my monthieur, every day.'

6
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:30,595
ls that your mother?
Your masseur, your Mercedes?

7
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:34,106
'My monthieur! You must help me!'

8
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:41,008
The best advice l can give you is
to either confront your monthieur or...

9
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:46,440
...work on your self-esteem.
Thank you for your call.

10
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:50,987
This is Dr Crane saying,
"Have a good evening, you deserve it."

11
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:55,650
Roz, aren't you screening these calls?

12
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:58,922
Yeah, but when you only have one,
you get less particular.

13
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:02,725
- You look nice.
- Yeah?

14
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:05,812
- l've got a date.
- Oh, great.

15
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:08,575
Why are you only wearing one heel?
You break it off?

16
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:11,294
No, l'm dating a sea captain
with a peg leg.

17
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:13,562
lt makes it easier when we dance.

18
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:16,857
l broke it off in a grate.

19
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:21,077
Who is this guy? Another trendy kid
who's got three earrings,

20
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:23,609
a ponytail and a T-shirt under his coat?

21
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:27,709
- ls he here?
- Where do you meet these people?

22
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:32,358
For your information,
he is a successful media consultant.

23
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:37,552
He graduated from Princeton, has a
house on Mercer lsland and a sailboat.

24
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:40,889
You met him on a bus, didn't you?

25
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:43,300
No, we shared a cab.

26
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:47,831
All right, he was driving it.

27
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:50,105
- Hello.
- You remember Roz?

28
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:54,558
- Yes. What brings you here?
- Oh, nothing.

29
00:01:57,075 --> 00:02:00,863
l was just passing by
and thought l'd stop in for a career.

30
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:03,638
Good luck.

31
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,631
The entrance to your garage is blocked

32
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:10,956
by a cab driver with a ponytail
scraping gum off the seat.

33
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:13,372
Madam, your chariot awaits.

34
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:16,715
Better get going.

35
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:21,202
Oh, actually, bad news.
The lecture's been cancelled.

36
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:27,633
l wasn't relishing the idea of three hours
on right-brain-left-brain-synergy.

37
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:33,092
l trimmed that speech to 21/2 hours
and l open with a funny Al Gore joke.

38
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:36,637
Let's not cry over spilt milk.
Now, we have a free evening.

39
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:40,736
This is a perfect opportunity
for two guys on the loose

40
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:44,387
to hit a sports bar, have a coupla
Brewskis, maybe take in a game.

41
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:47,618
Right. What shall we do?

42
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:51,254
- Dinner?
- Perfect.

43
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:54,814
No place fancy. We don't want
a heavy meal with deserts.

44
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:58,125
- Your turn to pay?
- You know me so well.

45
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:07,434
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

46
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:10,118
Where l parked, the sign said

47
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:12,992
it was just for
customers of those stores.

48
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:14,311
lt's fine.

49
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:18,406
l'll nip to Crabtree & Evelyn
and buy a bar of lavender soap.

50
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:23,575
- You're a man! You'd look ridiculous.
- Something to drink?

51
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:27,025
Fuzzy Navel blended nice and frothy.

52
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:30,130
- Martini, Niles?
- No, l'm driving.

53
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:35,218
- l'll buy some hand towels.
- Sit down!

54
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:41,877
Unless my eyes deceive me,
that's Dad sitting over there.

55
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:46,261
You're right. He said he was
going to Duke's with the boys.

56
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:48,671
That certainly isn't the boys.

57
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:54,250
- lt must be a clandestine rendezvous.
- Sly boots. He didn't want us to know.

58
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:57,404
Oh, he's looking this way. Turn around.

59
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:01,403
What are they doing?

60
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:04,297
lt's sort of cute. He's holding her hand...

61
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:07,045
Don't look!

62
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:11,801
l'll tell you when you can look.
Not now. Not now.

63
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:15,771
OK, now. No, not now!

64
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:22,729
- Oh, l don't like this one bit.
- What are they doing?

65
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:27,172
Nothing, but if Dad's eating here,
this can't be a good restaurant.

66
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:35,177
- l wonder if it's their first date.
- They seem to be having a good time.

67
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:40,800
- What are they doing?
- They're talking. He's smiling at her.

68
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:46,510
And she's just collapsed in tears.
She's sobbing uncontrollably.

69
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:49,983
Oh, yeah,
that's a Crane first date all right.

70
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,326
She's coming this way. Hide!

71
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:57,680
- You know who that is?
- She looked familiar.

72
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:03,118
- That was Marion Lawlor.
- l last heard that name as a kid.

73
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:06,105
Mom and Dad fell out with the Lawlors.

74
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:09,062
They did, when we shared a cabin.

75
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:11,740
Maybe Dad's just patching things up.

76
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,409
Doing his usual bang-up job.

77
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:18,534
This is awkward. Let's get out of here.

78
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:21,537
No, if we leave now, he'll spot us.

79
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:26,178
- Maybe you should have that Martini.
- l can't, l'm driving.

80
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:29,606
Not any more.
They just towed your car.

81
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:45,440
You little hooligan, get off that couch!
You're not supposed to do that.

82
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:50,082
lf Dr Crane sees you,
he'll throw both of us off the balcony!

83
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:53,311
Good boy. Now, you stay there.

84
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:11,648
Eddie... Glad to see my rules
about the couch are taking hold.

85
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:18,707
Good dog.

86
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,427
Dad, Daphne!

87
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:25,063
- Hello, Dr Crane.
- Hello. Where's Dad?

88
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:28,335
Mr Dorsey invited him over
to watch the ballgame.

89
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,947
Great,
he's getting to know the neighbours.

90
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:34,455
What?

91
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:38,122
- Why don't you grow a moustache?
- lt wouldn't suit me.

92
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,955
- Oh, yes, it does.
- You've never seen me with one.

93
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:46,509
l have. There's a billboard
for your show down on 16th Street.

94
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:50,062
- Some kids spray painted you.
- lt looked good?

95
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:53,246
Oh, yes. But a word to the wise.

96
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:57,247
Take care of your teeth -
that look is not flattering on you.

97
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,270
l'll get it.

98
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:05,910
Hello, Dr Crane.

99
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:08,204
- Hello.
- What brings you here?

100
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:10,904
A Rent-a-car, thanks to my brother.

101
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:14,316
- l assume you're here for a reason.
- Yes.

102
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:20,631
Frasier, last night when l got home,
that incident with Dad and Mrs Lawlor

103
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:24,581
made me think what caused
the rift between our families.

104
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:27,292
So l dug out my old boyhood journal

105
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:32,692
and looked up my entries from our
last summer together at the lake.

106
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:36,468
According to this,
there was a three-week period

107
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:40,180
where Mom and Dad
had screaming matches every night.

108
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:42,697
- l don't recall that.
- That's right.

109
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:46,875
That was when you wore the wax
earplugs and the slumber mask.

110
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:52,302
You were looking at the
"National Geographic" with a flashlight.

111
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,348
- l was looking at the maps.
- That's what makes it scary.

112
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,391
What was your point?

113
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:04,605
Something more
provocative happened

114
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:07,976
during that same period. Here.

115
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,632
Read this.

116
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:14,866
"Though summer at the lake seems
but a vapid, vacuous experience,

117
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:19,754
"it is a tonic for my troubled youth."
How old were you when you wrote this?

118
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,161
Almost nine.

119
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:27,474
Which explains the redundancy
"vapid" and "vacuous".

120
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:30,267
By ten, my writing had gotten tighter.

121
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:33,589
Among other things.

122
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:37,324
The point is that
l crept out onto the screen porch,

123
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:41,920
leaving the lights off
so as not to attract bats and moths.

124
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:44,991
As l peered out through the darkness,

125
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:49,348
between the trees l saw Dad
and Mrs Lawlor in each other's arms.

126
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:53,086
lt's clear what happened.
Dad and Mrs Lawlor had an affair.

127
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:57,162
l appreciate your attempt
to spice up our family history,

128
00:08:57,495 --> 00:09:00,214
but we're not a Jackie Collins novel.
lt's ridiculous.

129
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:03,535
ls it?
All right, allow me to present exhibit "B".

130
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:07,350
This is a photo album
Mom prepared of the same period.

131
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:10,664
l love to see old family photos.

132
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:15,245
My goodness, what a handsome,
sinewy young bloke!

133
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:17,076
That was Dad.

134
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:19,502
You two take after your mother,
don't you?

135
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,846
All right. Look at this.

136
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:26,221
That's Dad, but the person
next to him has been cut out.

137
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:31,757
And here, you can still see the edges
of a dress and a handbag and sandals.

138
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:34,669
Who's that scrawny chap

139
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:37,383
with the fish-belly complexion
and rain hat?

140
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:41,733
l was under doctor's orders
to stay out of direct sunlight.

141
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:48,968
We don't know that was Mrs Lawlor.
lt wouldn't prove they had an affair.

142
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:53,294
- What?
- Niles thinks Dad had an illicit affair.

143
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:57,389
- Your father? He's not the type.
- That's what l think.

144
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:00,520
- And there's not enough proof.
- ls it impossible?

145
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:04,518
- Anything is possible.
- Why don't you ask him?

146
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:09,882
Right. "Father, did you boff a neighbour
while we were roasting marshmallows?"

147
00:10:13,697 --> 00:10:16,370
Ah. There's one sure way
to get the truth.

148
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:19,172
- We'll call Aunt Vivienne.
- Who's that?

149
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:22,250
Better known as the Mouth.

150
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:26,248
- We are not calling her.
- You afraid of finding out something?

151
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:30,372
Yes, that she knows where l live
and she still drives.

152
00:10:30,714 --> 00:10:34,389
You two are worse
than gossipy washerwomen.

153
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:37,755
The way to solve this
is to ask your father.

154
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:41,171
Ask me what?

155
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:45,831
Your sons have some cockeyed notion
that you had an affair 30 years ago.

156
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:48,178
What?

157
00:10:53,028 --> 00:10:58,739
- Where did that idea come from?
- Frasier saw you with Marion Lawlor.

158
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:02,390
- You were with me!
- You were spying on me?

159
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:07,858
No, we were just having dinner
when you were "with your buddies".

160
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:10,526
That proves l had an affair?

161
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:16,870
No, but Niles remembered this time
when he saw you and her hugging.

162
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:20,260
lt was the time
when you and Mom were fighting a lot.

163
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:24,025
- Then you stopped seeing the Lawlors.
- This is stupid!

164
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:29,345
Right. They were even going to
give some Aunt Vivienne a call.

165
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:35,188
Daphne, would you give me a minute
alone with these two?

166
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:36,847
l understand.

167
00:11:37,072 --> 00:11:41,111
Send the help to the room.
l never get to hear any good stuff.

168
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:50,874
Don't bother calling Aunt Vivienne.
You want to know the truth? Fine.

169
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:54,471
l had an affair.

170
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:58,226
lt happened long ago
and it's not anything l'm proud of.

171
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:02,305
Now that l've answered everything,
do me a favour.

172
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,597
This is never to be
brought up again, understand?

173
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:08,008
End of discussion.

174
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:15,166
Well...

175
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:18,469
lt's times like this that most families...

176
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:22,818
...pull together and draw strength
from each other.

177
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:26,272
What shall we do?

178
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:37,549
Thank you.

179
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:41,311
l came to see how you are,
but l only have a few minutes.

180
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:45,311
l start my "healing with humour"
support group tonight and...

181
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,676
l must pick up my big shoes.

182
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:52,644
How am l doing?
How are you doing, Niles?

183
00:12:53,023 --> 00:12:56,299
Doesn't it bother you
that your father cheated on my mother?

184
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:01,265
Your loyalties are seeping through.

185
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:05,444
Besides, l got Mom's small features
while you got Dad's chunky thighs.

186
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:10,210
lt must have caused Mom a lot of pain.

187
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:15,208
Agreed, but they went on
and had a very happy life together.

188
00:13:15,587 --> 00:13:18,340
They got over it. Why can't you?

189
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,622
Rationally,
l should be able to handle this.

190
00:13:20,884 --> 00:13:23,796
l deal with human frailty every day.

191
00:13:25,055 --> 00:13:30,413
But in this case, it's not people -
one of our parents had an affair.

192
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,040
How could Dad cheat with Marion

193
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:36,783
knowing the effect
it would have on Mom and us?

194
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:40,384
Why don't you just
pull up a chair and join us?

195
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:46,539
l just can't believe
that it's...it's our father.

196
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:50,827
l never had a great relationship
with him,

197
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:54,478
but l always respected his integrity.

198
00:13:54,793 --> 00:13:57,944
Just thinking about
what he did sickens me.

199
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:02,930
As your brother, as a therapist,
l think you have to let this go.

200
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:07,010
You should come to my
"healing with humour" support group.

201
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:10,774
Thank you, but l need a night to myself.

202
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:14,449
lf you change your mind,
it should be a hoot.

203
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:17,763
As we speak,
l'm wearing oversized polka-dot boxers

204
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:20,421
and quick-release suspenders.

205
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:40,187
l see all sorts of things have been
going on behind my back! Get...!

206
00:14:48,138 --> 00:14:50,698
- Frasier?
- Yes.

207
00:14:50,974 --> 00:14:55,206
You may not remember me.
Marion Lawlor.

208
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:59,601
- Yes, l remember you.
- ls your Dad home?

209
00:14:59,941 --> 00:15:04,969
No, but if you come back later,
you can have the place to yourselves.

210
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:08,639
No, that's not necessary.
We had dinner the other night,

211
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:11,748
and l left rather abruptly.

212
00:15:12,037 --> 00:15:16,189
l wanted to tell him l'm sorry.
Would you please give him my best?

213
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:19,897
l think you've already done that.

214
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:23,044
ls this a bad time? You seem upset.

215
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,934
Would you come in for a moment?

216
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:31,647
After you met with Dad the other night,

217
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:36,721
he and l talked, and l learned
what happened that summer.

218
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:39,856
Oh, l'm sorry.

219
00:15:40,148 --> 00:15:45,461
l'm not the kind of person who can hear
news like that and just forget about it.

220
00:15:46,738 --> 00:15:48,694
l know you're upset.

221
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:52,907
But if it's any consolation,
in time, your father and l forgave them.

222
00:15:53,244 --> 00:15:54,882
Forgave them?

223
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:59,000
Your mother was a good person.

224
00:15:59,334 --> 00:16:03,293
So was my husband.
They made a mistake.

225
00:16:04,923 --> 00:16:10,680
Anyway, tell your father l stopped by.
l felt so silly crying the other night.

226
00:16:11,096 --> 00:16:15,726
l've been a little overemotional
since Dan died.

227
00:16:16,101 --> 00:16:18,535
Oh, l'm sorry. l didn't know.

228
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:22,521
You never realise
how hard that's going to hit you.

229
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,053
Look who l'm telling this to!

230
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:30,551
The famous radio psychiatrist
Dr Frasier Crane!

231
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:37,096
l remember you when you ran around
in your undies with your pail and shovel.

232
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:42,871
Yes, well, l rarely
get to the shore any more.

233
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:46,169
Well, goodbye, Frasier.

234
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:48,182
Goodbye.

235
00:16:57,142 --> 00:17:00,976
Working on the docks has always
been a tradition for us Moons.

236
00:17:01,312 --> 00:17:05,430
Me father worked on the docks,
me grandfather. All me brothers do.

237
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:07,925
Well, except for Billy.

238
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:11,231
He came home one day,
saying he hated the smell of fish.

239
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:14,284
He was going to teach
ballroom dancing.

240
00:17:14,576 --> 00:17:18,012
And he did. And he does.

241
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:22,960
He's me mum's favourite. Dad flicks
the crust off his kidney pie at him.

242
00:17:23,335 --> 00:17:25,929
How much longer do l have to do this?

243
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:31,411
Be patient. You don't want to drag
your leg behind you like a dead branch.

244
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:35,237
l'm talking about
listening to your family's history.

245
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:40,993
Why would a man of your intelligence
say a thing like that

246
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:45,672
when you're in the position you're in,
and l'm in the position l'm in?

247
00:17:46,024 --> 00:17:47,503
All right.

248
00:17:48,485 --> 00:17:50,715
'Up you come.'

249
00:17:55,033 --> 00:17:59,549
That's much better.
l'll go run your bath.

250
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:08,141
Hi, Dad. You look kinda tired.

251
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:11,413
l just finished
my exercises with Nurse Ratchet.

252
00:18:13,677 --> 00:18:17,590
- Do you have to watch TV right now?
- Yeah, my programme's on.

253
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:22,527
lf either of us could work the VCR,
we'd tape it, but...

254
00:18:22,894 --> 00:18:25,533
There's something l'd like to talk about.

255
00:18:25,814 --> 00:18:29,363
Oh, for God's sake.
l've told you everything l'm going to.

256
00:18:29,693 --> 00:18:31,649
Now drop it.

257
00:18:37,409 --> 00:18:39,206
Dad...

258
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:42,171
- Why didn't you tell me the truth?
- l did.

259
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:47,973
Marion Lawlor came by today
to apologise for the other night.

260
00:18:48,378 --> 00:18:52,530
While she was here,
she told me what really happened.

261
00:18:53,675 --> 00:18:57,224
So now you know.
You stuck your nose

262
00:18:57,554 --> 00:18:59,545
where it didn't belong.
Are you happy now?

263
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:03,799
- Why didn't you tell me it was Mom?
- Cos it's none of your business!

264
00:19:04,144 --> 00:19:08,103
l understand you being defensive,
but l had a right to know.

265
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,795
This happens to a lot of people.

266
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:14,855
lf it's any consolation,
l know exactly how you feel.

267
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:19,474
l never told you this,
but Lilith did the same thing to me.

268
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:21,817
Lilith had an affair?

269
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:25,832
lt was the most humiliating
experience of my life.

270
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:29,602
l'm sure you felt the same way.

271
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:34,947
l hadn't thought about it for some time,
but thanks for reminding me.

272
00:19:35,342 --> 00:19:37,412
Lilith?

273
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:42,963
l found her attractive!
ls it strange another man might, too?

274
00:19:44,184 --> 00:19:46,300
l guess.

275
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:50,406
- Who was the bozo in your case?
- Oh, God.

276
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:56,208
A Frenchman who lived in
a self-contained underground ecopod.

277
00:19:56,613 --> 00:20:01,164
That still sounds better
than a urologist with a bad comb-over.

278
00:20:04,454 --> 00:20:05,728
l'm sorry.

279
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:12,056
Look, do me a favour.
Don't hate your mother for this.

280
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:20,778
l wasn't easy to live with, and she had
plenty of reason for doing what she did.

281
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:24,694
Luckily, we were able to
put it behind us, but l'll tell you...

282
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:28,129
...at times it tore me up.

283
00:20:31,606 --> 00:20:34,678
l loved your mother.

284
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:36,895
So did l.

285
00:20:38,405 --> 00:20:43,684
l know, son. That's why l said
l was the one who had the affair.

286
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:47,433
l was just trying to protect her.

287
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:51,535
Me, you already had problems with.

288
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:56,188
l appreciate what you did,
but you should have told me.

289
00:20:56,548 --> 00:21:01,576
Listen. When Frederick grows up,
will you tell him what Lilith did to you?

290
00:21:06,808 --> 00:21:08,241
OK.

291
00:21:08,476 --> 00:21:11,070
- Can l watch my programme now?
- One second.

292
00:21:11,354 --> 00:21:14,471
l gotta clear one thing up.
There's this photo album.

293
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:19,609
There's all these pictures
with the same woman cut out of them.

294
00:21:19,988 --> 00:21:23,867
What else do you notice, Sherlock?
Like, where's your mother?

295
00:21:25,452 --> 00:21:28,330
- Oh, that was Mom!
- Yes.

296
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:32,011
She cut herself out of it.
She'd put a few pounds on.

297
00:21:32,334 --> 00:21:35,053
She wore a brown dress with a belt.

298
00:21:35,337 --> 00:21:39,933
Aunt Vivienne said she looked
like a knackwurst tied in the middle.

299
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:45,294
We've been trying
to find something we have in common.

300
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:49,229
- l think we finally found it.
- Yeah.
