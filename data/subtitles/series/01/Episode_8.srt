1
00:00:08,848 --> 00:00:13,558
He calls himself a quarterback? I've
passed kidney stones more accurately.

2
00:00:14,691 --> 00:00:18,889
Roz, could you get my briefcase?
I left it in the studio.

3
00:00:19,239 --> 00:00:21,434
Why don't you go get it?

4
00:00:21,702 --> 00:00:23,658
He always humiliates me on the air.

5
00:00:23,914 --> 00:00:26,144
What do you think he does to me?

6
00:00:26,418 --> 00:00:30,889
Last week, he introduced me as
martina navratilova's girlfriend.

7
00:00:33,513 --> 00:00:36,107
Chuck, i'm sorry i offended you.

8
00:00:36,393 --> 00:00:40,386
Now, why don't you put your skirt
back on and do some dishes?

9
00:00:40,733 --> 00:00:43,452
The lines are open.

10
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:48,869
How about some real men calling in
instead of crybabies like chuck?

11
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:54,606
Ah! Look who just crawled in:
Dr frasier crane.

12
00:00:54,924 --> 00:00:58,121
And you know what we do when
we get a house call from the doctor.

13
00:00:58,429 --> 00:01:02,468
'drop your pants,
bend over. I take your temperature.'

14
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:06,206
Hello, bulldog.

15
00:01:06,484 --> 00:01:09,317
Who's your pick for
the giants/saints game this weekend?

16
00:01:09,614 --> 00:01:11,764
- The giants.
- No.

17
00:01:12,035 --> 00:01:14,185
- The saints.
- No.

18
00:01:14,455 --> 00:01:18,767
- Somebody has to win.
- If they were playing this weekend!

19
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:21,644
 

20
00:01:21,926 --> 00:01:24,679
Very funny.
You should play it on my show.

21
00:01:24,973 --> 00:01:28,886
It deserves to be heard by
a larger audience. Hee-haw! Hee-haw!

22
00:01:33,487 --> 00:01:36,047
 

23
00:01:37,243 --> 00:01:39,393
Hello, dr crane.

24
00:01:39,664 --> 00:01:43,657
- I brought this for dinner.
- Hey, niles. You're early.

25
00:01:44,005 --> 00:01:48,476
I put maris on the train to chicago.
I am desolate without her.

26
00:01:48,846 --> 00:01:50,837
Champagne?

27
00:01:51,851 --> 00:01:53,842
It goes with all occasions.

28
00:01:54,104 --> 00:01:57,414
- Can i assist you in the kitchen?
- No, i have everything well in hand.

29
00:01:57,735 --> 00:01:59,930
Ah, well, lucky everything.

30
00:02:05,372 --> 00:02:07,488
Mmm... uh-uh...

31
00:02:10,507 --> 00:02:11,906
uh-uh...

32
00:02:12,134 --> 00:02:16,764
- what would you do?
- Take that corn nut off the board.

33
00:02:17,142 --> 00:02:20,691
That's my bishop.
Eddie ate the real one.

34
00:02:21,024 --> 00:02:23,697
In that case, corn nut to rook 7.

35
00:02:23,987 --> 00:02:25,864
Hello, all.

36
00:02:26,116 --> 00:02:29,347
Evening.
Your brother brought champagne!

37
00:02:29,663 --> 00:02:32,860
Oh, maris left for chicago already?

38
00:02:35,005 --> 00:02:37,439
She's riding the rails as we speak.

39
00:02:37,717 --> 00:02:39,992
Why doesn't she fly instead?

40
00:02:40,264 --> 00:02:43,973
She's been afraid to fly
since her harrowing incident.

41
00:02:44,312 --> 00:02:46,223
Did her plane almost crash?

42
00:02:46,482 --> 00:02:49,042
No, she was bumped from first class.

43
00:02:50,698 --> 00:02:52,654
She still wakes up screaming.

44
00:02:52,909 --> 00:02:56,458
- Frasier, i got a favour to ask you.
- What is it?

45
00:02:56,791 --> 00:03:00,909
A buddy of mine is running
the widows and orphans fund benefit,

46
00:03:01,257 --> 00:03:05,091
and he needs some local
celebrities for his bachelor auction.

47
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:09,264
If we could get somebody
really famous from the radio station...

48
00:03:09,604 --> 00:03:13,040
- i'd be delighted to help.
- So you'll ask bulldog?

49
00:03:16,282 --> 00:03:19,240
- Bulldog?
- Oh, well, you know...

50
00:03:19,537 --> 00:03:21,892
i... well, i mean...

51
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:25,795
don't get me wrong,
i was going to ask you, too.

52
00:03:26,131 --> 00:03:29,362
- I was just saving the best for last.
- Uh-huh.

53
00:03:29,678 --> 00:03:33,557
If he back-pedals any faster,
he'll trip over his walker.

54
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:38,100
All right, i'll do it.

55
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,396
I really appreciate it.

56
00:03:40,655 --> 00:03:44,807
- You won't forget to ask bulldog?
- I'll leave a note on his hydrant.

57
00:03:46,873 --> 00:03:50,502
Oh, a bachelor auction.
It'd be fun to pick a man off the block

58
00:03:50,839 --> 00:03:53,751
to do my bidding
and fulfil my every desire.

59
00:03:54,052 --> 00:03:57,169
- Doctor crane?
- I'd love to. I mean... i...

60
00:03:58,643 --> 00:04:00,042
uh... frasier?

61
00:04:01,064 --> 00:04:03,658
What if no one bids?

62
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:07,902
What if you're left standing there
with flop sweat trickling down your back

63
00:04:08,242 --> 00:04:11,120
amidst a great gaping silence?

64
00:04:11,414 --> 00:04:14,167
- It'll never happen.
- Thank you, dad.

65
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:17,338
Yeah, we got a band.

66
00:04:21,097 --> 00:04:24,055
our next
bachelor on the block is public tv's

67
00:04:24,352 --> 00:04:27,344
own cute and cuddly mr science!

68
00:04:27,649 --> 00:04:30,288
 

69
00:04:30,571 --> 00:04:34,325
God, the oestrogen level
is off the charts out there.

70
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,696
Yeah, isn't it great!

71
00:04:36,956 --> 00:04:40,266
Deep down, chicks are just like guys -
we all want the same thing.

72
00:04:40,587 --> 00:04:43,055
Frasier crane does not put out.

73
00:04:43,342 --> 00:04:45,810
All they're getting is a gourmet meal

74
00:04:46,096 --> 00:04:49,247
- and a handshake at the door.
- Boring!

75
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,712
My date gets a stretch limo, dinner,
floor seats at the sonics game,

76
00:04:54,068 --> 00:04:58,539
and these incredible buns of steel.
Feel them, doc. C'mon, feel them!

77
00:04:58,909 --> 00:05:00,706
Thank you, no.

78
00:05:00,954 --> 00:05:03,149
 

79
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:07,329
Ladies, keep your
articles of clothing off the stage.

80
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:11,633
Show these women celebrity beefcake
and they go nutso!

81
00:05:11,973 --> 00:05:17,411
Typical mob mentality. I hope
the fire exits are clearly marked.

82
00:05:17,815 --> 00:05:20,488
Relax, will you?

83
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:24,691
You're not the one jumping into the
rottweiler pit carrying a pork chop.

84
00:05:25,035 --> 00:05:29,426
Hey, that's t.j. Smith
he's a linebacker for the seahawks!

85
00:05:29,793 --> 00:05:33,832
They call him "the enforcer".
He's put two quarterbacks in hospital.

86
00:05:34,175 --> 00:05:36,484
T.j., marty crane!

87
00:05:36,763 --> 00:05:40,642
- Number 19?
- Please don't make me go out there.

88
00:05:40,978 --> 00:05:45,290
Oh... you'll be fine. Just go on out there
and have a good time.

89
00:05:45,653 --> 00:05:47,803
 

90
00:05:49,534 --> 00:05:51,490
They're gonna have him for breakfast.

91
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:57,929
 

92
00:05:58,215 --> 00:05:59,967
How was it?

93
00:06:00,218 --> 00:06:03,096
They're like sharks in a feeding frenzy.

94
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:05,506
The one who bought me looked crazed.

95
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:07,886
Where do i pay?

96
00:06:08,148 --> 00:06:11,458
- Roz!
- I saw what i wanted and i went after it.

97
00:06:12,781 --> 00:06:14,533
Stay!

98
00:06:16,161 --> 00:06:17,913
Number 20?

99
00:06:18,207 --> 00:06:22,883
- That's me.
- I really appreciate this.

100
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:26,454
Having somebody like you
in the auction really adds class.

101
00:06:26,762 --> 00:06:29,834
If the bidding gets slow,

102
00:06:30,142 --> 00:06:34,215
drop a quarter and take
a couple of minutes to pick it up, huh?

103
00:06:38,365 --> 00:06:42,483
 sold! To that determined
lady in the back row for $500!

104
00:06:42,831 --> 00:06:45,220
 

105
00:06:45,501 --> 00:06:48,937
- So, doc, who bought you?
- No idea.

106
00:06:49,258 --> 00:06:51,692
The last thing i remember
is someone shouting out:

107
00:06:51,971 --> 00:06:54,280
"Shake your money maker!"

108
00:06:57,104 --> 00:07:00,574
- Number 21.
- Ladies, start your engines!

109
00:07:00,901 --> 00:07:03,859
 

110
00:07:05,326 --> 00:07:07,317
Doctor crane?

111
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:10,731
Kristina harper. I just bought you.

112
00:07:14,925 --> 00:07:17,359
You... bought me?

113
00:07:17,638 --> 00:07:21,028
Yeah. I listen to your show.
I'm a big fan of yours.

114
00:07:21,353 --> 00:07:23,947
Well, how... wonderful.

115
00:07:27,028 --> 00:07:30,577
You bought me for $500.
That's a lot of money.

116
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:33,424
I did a layout for "seattle style".

117
00:07:33,706 --> 00:07:36,539
- Are you a photographer?
- No, i'm a model.

118
00:07:36,836 --> 00:07:39,953
A model! How wonderful!
For you...

119
00:07:40,258 --> 00:07:42,374
how about friday?

120
00:07:42,638 --> 00:07:46,517
Ok. I live at the elliot bay towers.
Around seven?

121
00:07:46,852 --> 00:07:50,447
- Sounds great. See you then.
- Bye.

122
00:07:55,242 --> 00:07:57,392
That's my new owner.

123
00:08:02,128 --> 00:08:04,119
She's a model.

124
00:08:04,382 --> 00:08:06,942
No kidding.
She almost put my eye out.

125
00:08:08,013 --> 00:08:10,083
You're back quick.

126
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:13,786
I was one of the last guys.
The money was running low.

127
00:08:14,106 --> 00:08:18,179
But there was still one rawhide
chew-toy out there for the bulldog.

128
00:08:22,578 --> 00:08:26,332
I got to take a squirt.
When i come back, we'll play fetch.

129
00:08:26,668 --> 00:08:28,784
My god! Daphne, why?

130
00:08:29,048 --> 00:08:32,358
Things were slow,
so your father asked me to shill.

131
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:36,512
I opened at $100.
Who knew that would be the only bid?

132
00:08:43,237 --> 00:08:45,193
 

133
00:08:46,201 --> 00:08:48,157
Whoosh!

134
00:09:09,155 --> 00:09:11,874
Kristina. Buonanotte.

135
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,549
Sorry i'm late but i got a call for a job.

136
00:09:14,831 --> 00:09:17,220
Ok. You're here now.

137
00:09:17,502 --> 00:09:21,097
No, the job's tonight,
but we could have dinner later.

138
00:09:21,426 --> 00:09:23,496
All right.

139
00:09:23,762 --> 00:09:26,071
I hope you didn't go
to too much trouble.

140
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:28,341
Oh, no!

141
00:09:29,772 --> 00:09:33,811
- You rented a restaurant trolley.
- No, i own it. You don't have one?

142
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:39,708
One more thing. My friend sandy
got called in on the same job

143
00:09:40,081 --> 00:09:43,960
and she was supposed
to look after my daughter.

144
00:09:47,844 --> 00:09:51,393
Don't tell me you want me to baby-sit.

145
00:09:51,725 --> 00:09:55,798
Sandy will take her when i get back
and that'll leave just the two of us.

146
00:09:56,149 --> 00:09:58,299
Kristina,
i'm not really sure if i can...

147
00:09:59,906 --> 00:10:03,103
- i'll make points for this, won't i?
- A ton.

148
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:08,517
Bring the darling in.

149
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:13,787
- This is my daughter renata.
- Hello.

150
00:10:14,096 --> 00:10:16,052
She's shy at first.

151
00:10:16,307 --> 00:10:17,262
 

152
00:10:17,476 --> 00:10:20,468
Oh, there's the elevator.
See you later.

153
00:10:24,028 --> 00:10:27,304
Well, come on in. Have a seat.

154
00:10:29,371 --> 00:10:32,124
Can i get you, uh... a soft drink?

155
00:10:34,629 --> 00:10:36,620
Goose liver paté?

156
00:10:38,469 --> 00:10:42,018
"Renata" that's a pretty name.
It must have...

157
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,739
can i use your phone?

158
00:10:45,021 --> 00:10:48,730
We're spending the evening together.
Let's make the best of it.

159
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:53,268
I may surprise you. I probably am
more "with it" than you think i am.

160
00:10:54,829 --> 00:10:57,787
The phone's right there.

161
00:11:00,755 --> 00:11:04,714
No way! No way!

162
00:11:05,054 --> 00:11:07,648
That is so fresh.

163
00:11:09,395 --> 00:11:11,226
No way!

164
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:14,402
No way!

165
00:11:16,156 --> 00:11:17,589
No...

166
00:11:17,825 --> 00:11:19,258
...way!

167
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:26,181
Hold on, there's another call.
Hello?

168
00:11:26,507 --> 00:11:29,101
he'll call you back.

169
00:11:31,139 --> 00:11:33,095
- No way!
- Who was that?

170
00:11:33,351 --> 00:11:35,819
I don't know.
No way!

171
00:11:36,105 --> 00:11:40,621
- Another call's coming in.
- I'll take this one. Hello?

172
00:11:42,032 --> 00:11:44,148
It's for you.

173
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:47,434
Hello? Hey, tiffany.

174
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,983
Tiffany! You just spoke to tiffany!

175
00:11:50,254 --> 00:11:53,690
That was tiffany schwartz.
This is tiffany martinez.

176
00:11:55,304 --> 00:11:59,695
I celebrate the ethnic mosaic
that is america, but nonetheless...

177
00:12:00,062 --> 00:12:02,098
what's your damage?

178
00:12:02,357 --> 00:12:04,746
You've been on the phone
for 1 ½ hours.

179
00:12:05,028 --> 00:12:07,781
You haven't spoken to me
except to ask for more cheetos!

180
00:12:08,075 --> 00:12:11,112
They're coming, eddie!

181
00:12:14,419 --> 00:12:17,456
I'm supposed to be happy i'm here?

182
00:12:17,757 --> 00:12:19,713
Her fabulousness dumps me here

183
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:22,040
with a total stranger
who could be a perv.

184
00:12:22,307 --> 00:12:27,779
I'm not thrilled about it either.
And i am not a perv.

185
00:12:28,192 --> 00:12:32,708
You don't get it.
She's always doing this. She's a flake.

186
00:12:33,074 --> 00:12:38,785
Flake or not, you are in my charge.
You should have something nutritious.

187
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:41,770
Now, how about seafood crepes?

188
00:12:42,048 --> 00:12:44,118
Lobster newburg?

189
00:12:44,385 --> 00:12:46,660
Corndog dipped in curare?

190
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:53,576
- Have you got any raw cookie dough?
- Even more lethal. Let's see.

191
00:12:53,943 --> 00:12:59,176
You wouldn't have gotten anywhere
with this gourmet meal routine.

192
00:12:59,576 --> 00:13:02,648
She eats nothing.
She's a total diet freak.

193
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:05,472
And she only talks about herself.

194
00:13:05,753 --> 00:13:09,302
- You don't care much for your mother?
- Well, duh

195
00:13:09,635 --> 00:13:13,947
I hate to think that when my son's
your age, he'll think of me as a...

196
00:13:14,309 --> 00:13:17,062
- dweeb?
- Thank you.

197
00:13:17,356 --> 00:13:19,916
Brace yourself.

198
00:13:21,864 --> 00:13:25,413
Oh, well, look what we have here.
Will one tube suffice?

199
00:13:25,744 --> 00:13:30,340
- Cool.
- Put that in your pipe and smoke it.

200
00:13:34,217 --> 00:13:38,688
Renata, you know... i am a psychiatrist.

201
00:13:39,058 --> 00:13:43,574
And if you're having problems
with your mother, i'd be glad to listen.

202
00:13:43,941 --> 00:13:48,173
You want me to tell you my problems
like those gomers on your show?

203
00:13:49,826 --> 00:13:53,819
- Like you care
- I do care about the gomers.

204
00:13:55,461 --> 00:13:58,897
- I even care about you.
- Don't make me hurl.

205
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:12,934
- She tells people i'm younger.
- Why do you think she does that?

206
00:14:13,323 --> 00:14:15,598
So they won't know how old she is.

207
00:14:15,869 --> 00:14:20,545
- I've been nine for three years.
- Really?

208
00:14:20,919 --> 00:14:24,070
Once she promised
to take me ice-skating.

209
00:14:24,383 --> 00:14:26,977
On the way there,
she saw a tattoo parlour.

210
00:14:27,263 --> 00:14:31,222
She left me outside to get
a butterfly tattooed on her shoulder.

211
00:14:31,562 --> 00:14:35,316
- She forgot i was out there.
- How old were you?

212
00:14:35,652 --> 00:14:38,166
That was the first time i was nine.

213
00:14:40,827 --> 00:14:43,216
What does your father say about this?

214
00:14:43,498 --> 00:14:47,457
Tony? He's on the road
with whitesnake all the time.

215
00:14:47,797 --> 00:14:50,994
- Is that a musical group or a pet?
- It's his new wife.

216
00:14:55,602 --> 00:15:00,198
I was apprehensive
about going out with you tonight,

217
00:15:00,568 --> 00:15:05,403
but i'm having a jolly time unless
it's the champagne getting to me.

218
00:15:05,784 --> 00:15:09,697
I have had quite a bit, haven't i?
Oh, who cares?

219
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:14,479
That's the beauty of being in a limo
unless the driver's drinking.

220
00:15:14,841 --> 00:15:19,073
You're not drinking, are you?
He's not drinking.

221
00:15:19,432 --> 00:15:21,423
 

222
00:15:21,686 --> 00:15:26,885
- Let's drink to the driver not drinking!
- Man, you're really looped... great!

223
00:15:27,278 --> 00:15:29,917
 

224
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:34,876
It certainly is taking a long time
getting out of this parking lot.

225
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:40,483
Did i say this was my first
basketball game? I did, four times.

226
00:15:40,884 --> 00:15:45,321
I still can't get over those players.
They're positively gigantic.

227
00:15:45,684 --> 00:15:49,962
Not that being tall is the only measure
of a man... but it's a bloody good one!

228
00:15:53,781 --> 00:15:58,172
Oh, dear, i just insulted you,
didn't i? Sorry.

229
00:15:58,539 --> 00:16:02,657
Oh, well, you can take it.
You're a tough little nut.

230
00:16:04,047 --> 00:16:07,357
Oh, dear...
this is not good, not good at all.

231
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:11,957
- You don't like the champagne?
- No, i can see the bottom of my glass!

232
00:16:12,312 --> 00:16:14,382
Well, bottoms up!

233
00:16:14,648 --> 00:16:19,164
You are a naughty boy.
Don't go getting any ideas.

234
00:16:19,531 --> 00:16:23,570
Oh, look who i'm saying this to.
You don't have an idea in your head.

235
00:16:26,585 --> 00:16:29,782
Oh! I did it again. I insulted you.

236
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:32,399
Let's drink to that. Boom!

237
00:16:34,348 --> 00:16:36,623
 

238
00:16:36,894 --> 00:16:38,885
Now, that is downright rude!

239
00:16:40,107 --> 00:16:45,022
Hey, you there! You in the firebird!
Yes, you, stop that honking!

240
00:16:45,407 --> 00:16:47,762
 

241
00:16:48,037 --> 00:16:51,586
Just because you look stupid
doesn't mean you have to act stupid!

242
00:16:51,918 --> 00:16:54,716
Don't aggravate him!

243
00:16:55,006 --> 00:16:57,474
Tosh! Civilisation won't progress

244
00:16:57,761 --> 00:17:01,151
unless someone points out
when people's manners are remiss.

245
00:17:01,476 --> 00:17:04,752
- move it!
- Oh, shut your bloody cakehole!

246
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:09,431
Don't do that!
He's getting out of his car now.

247
00:17:09,739 --> 00:17:12,811
- Ooh, he's a tall one, too.
- Roll up your window!

248
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,076
He won't hurt a woman.

249
00:17:15,332 --> 00:17:19,883
- Just roll it up!
- Oh...! Let him go!

250
00:17:20,257 --> 00:17:25,456
- let him go, you big ugly oaf!
- Shut up!

251
00:17:26,892 --> 00:17:29,804
 

252
00:17:30,106 --> 00:17:32,904
Oh... well, we're moving.

253
00:17:34,905 --> 00:17:38,659
Thank you, pit bull!
I had a lovely time!

254
00:17:51,224 --> 00:17:54,534
You know,
this cookie dough is not that bad.

255
00:17:56,441 --> 00:18:00,070
Of course, i'm sure later
i'll be hurling, but, well...

256
00:18:00,406 --> 00:18:02,397
 

257
00:18:02,659 --> 00:18:06,538
- Her fabulousness. Want that dough?
- I'd better not.

258
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:11,426
If i gain an ounce, she goes ballistic.
She makes me weigh in every morning.

259
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:15,759
- You poor thing.
- I'm used to it.

260
00:18:17,518 --> 00:18:19,827
Hi, i'm back.

261
00:18:20,106 --> 00:18:24,384
Renata, honey... sandy's
waiting downstairs in the car.

262
00:18:26,574 --> 00:18:30,044
Renata? I must say, i had a rather
enjoyable evening.

263
00:18:30,372 --> 00:18:33,011
You don't get out much, do you?

264
00:18:34,087 --> 00:18:36,043
I think she likes me.

265
00:18:36,298 --> 00:18:40,849
Thank you for helping me out.
Now roll out that trolley. I'm starved.

266
00:18:41,223 --> 00:18:44,340
You know... i don't think so.

267
00:18:44,646 --> 00:18:47,763
Spend the evening
with your daughter.

268
00:18:48,068 --> 00:18:50,741
But i thought we had a date.

269
00:18:51,031 --> 00:18:56,185
When we first met, i was attracted
by your remarkable beauty,

270
00:18:56,582 --> 00:18:59,619
but now that i know
a bit more about you,

271
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:03,230
suddenly you don't look so good, sister.

272
00:19:07,558 --> 00:19:09,310
Excuse me?

273
00:19:09,562 --> 00:19:13,316
You don't leave your daughter
on some street corner

274
00:19:13,651 --> 00:19:15,881
while you're getting tattooed,

275
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:20,354
or keep her in some never-never land
where everyone is nine forever!

276
00:19:20,705 --> 00:19:22,457
Renata told you that?

277
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:26,747
Yes, she also told me about the time
you left her with the coat-check girl.

278
00:19:27,091 --> 00:19:29,764
What kind of mother are you?

279
00:19:30,054 --> 00:19:33,683
Did it occur to you she might be lying?

280
00:19:34,019 --> 00:19:37,409
Cos this is the first night
i've been out in a year.

281
00:19:37,733 --> 00:19:41,692
John and marianne never take her,
her father and his new wife.

282
00:19:42,032 --> 00:19:45,388
- Who are tony and whitesnake?
- Our two dogs.

283
00:19:51,172 --> 00:19:55,324
Most nights, i stay home
and i help her with her homework.

284
00:19:55,680 --> 00:20:00,959
Except last saturday, when i took
her and her 12 friends ice-skating.

285
00:20:01,355 --> 00:20:05,234
I don't suppose that during that party
you got your shoulder tattooed?

286
00:20:06,865 --> 00:20:09,982
Do you see anything there, hmm?

287
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:14,372
No.

288
00:20:14,627 --> 00:20:17,937
But then, my eyes are tearing up.

289
00:20:22,932 --> 00:20:26,891
- But why would she lie?
- Because she's 12 and mad at me.

290
00:20:27,231 --> 00:20:29,540
I wouldn't let her stay home alone.

291
00:20:29,819 --> 00:20:33,858
I probably would have been better off
if i had! Some shrink you are

292
00:20:34,202 --> 00:20:38,275
Child development is not my thing.
My specialty is adult relations.

293
00:20:38,626 --> 00:20:41,982
You won't be having
any of those tonight.

294
00:20:42,298 --> 00:20:44,050
Don't go!

295
00:20:44,301 --> 00:20:48,010
Oh, by the way, i only have one
kidney. Guess who has the other?

296
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:16,769
Is the coast clear?
Where's the supermodel?

297
00:21:17,106 --> 00:21:19,336
She left.

298
00:21:19,609 --> 00:21:22,885
I was afraid i might walk in
on an embarrassing moment.

299
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:29,354
- You would have, half an hour ago.
- What are you doing still up?

300
00:21:29,793 --> 00:21:35,663
I was just wondering if my sweet boy
is going to be a monster when he's 12.

301
00:21:36,095 --> 00:21:38,370
What the hell brought that up?

302
00:21:39,726 --> 00:21:41,717
It's a long story.
Do you really want to hear it?

303
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:44,050
Well, it is getting late...

304
00:21:45,861 --> 00:21:50,298
all kids start out cute,
then somewhere along the way,

305
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:53,379
they get into that know-it-all stage.

306
00:21:53,665 --> 00:21:56,657
- You think they'll never grow out of it.
- Eventually they do.

307
00:21:56,962 --> 00:21:58,953
I'm still hoping.

308
00:22:00,677 --> 00:22:02,747
