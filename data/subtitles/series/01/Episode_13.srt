1
00:00:08,049 --> 00:00:13,169
Though washing one's hands 20 to 30
times a day is obsessive-compulsive,

2
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:18,549
please bear in mind
that your husband is a coroner.

3
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:25,397
Thank you for your call.
Roz, whom do we have next?

4
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:29,329
Ethan is having a problem at school.

5
00:00:29,654 --> 00:00:33,203
- Hello, ethan. I'm listening.
- 'Hi, dr crane.'

6
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:37,890
- How old are you?
- 'I'm 13.

7
00:00:38,246 --> 00:00:40,202
'I'm having problems
with the other kids.

8
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:42,607
They're always beating me up.'

9
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:45,265
Why do you think that's so?

10
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:47,820
'Because i'm smart. I have a 160 iq.

11
00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:50,922
'I'm in the astronomy club
and i hate sports.'

12
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:56,211
Well, the other children are just
acting out of jealousy and immaturity.

13
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:58,953
I know it doesn't help much now

14
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:03,696
but the day will come
when you will have the last laugh.

15
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:07,123
'That's it? '

16
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:10,649
Yes.

17
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:15,773
'I find that advice patronising,
simplistic and uninspired.

18
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:21,187
'The real surprise here is they pay you
to dole out this balloon juice.'

19
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:26,120
- Ethan, where are you calling from?
- 'Home.'

20
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:29,297
If any of ethan's
classmates are listening...

21
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:33,996
...you know where he is,
and he can't stay there forever.

22
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:40,145
Thank you for your call.

23
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:45,632
That's about it for today. This is
frasier crane kacl talk radio, 780am.

24
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:53,303
- That was a pretty good show, eh?
- Sure, whatever you say.

25
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:58,251
- Got another one of your hot dates?
- If you must know, yes.

26
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:02,930
- Pick you up outside in five minutes?
- Great. Thanks, noel.

27
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:12,966
Noel? Noel shemsky from sales?
That's who your date is with?

28
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:15,696
We're just having a drink.

29
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:18,119
Noel, the mole?

30
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:22,939
I know he's not great-iooking,
i know he drives a '73 dodge polaris,

31
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:28,019
but he's always struck me
as a really interesting guy.

32
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:31,037
The world's full of superficial guys.

33
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:35,993
He's got a good heart,
he's smart, he's substantial,

34
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:40,960
and considering my track record lately,
i'd expect your support.

35
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:46,196
Does noel still have that autographed
picture of captain kirk in his cubicle?

36
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:49,851
Why do i tell you anything?

37
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,642
Knock, knock!
Can i be of any assistance?

38
00:02:56,926 --> 00:03:00,202
Oh, no thank you.
I have everything under control.

39
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:04,426
Mind if i linger? I've always been
sort of a kitchen person.

40
00:03:05,477 --> 00:03:08,150
Suit yourself. I like the company.

41
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:11,396
So how is dad's therapy going?

42
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:15,843
We can see more mobility in his hip
and his flexibility is improving,

43
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:19,711
but it's a chore
to get him to do his exercises.

44
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:23,662
But if i bribe him with sweets...

45
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:26,873
oh, my goodness!

46
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:29,520
Oh, dr crane!

47
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:35,351
Dr crane, can you get up?

48
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:37,987
No, i'll stay here for a few minutes.

49
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:40,409
Niles, what are you doing?

50
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:44,797
- He conked his head on the hood.
- You are shameless!

51
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:49,532
I have a sore head and a crackerjack
lawyer, so don't crowd me.

52
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:55,001
- Here, put this on it.
- You've been wonderful in this crisis.

53
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,909
Oh, come on, camille.
I need to talk to you.

54
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,436
I'm having a young lady over on friday.

55
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:06,178
- Could you take dad out?
- I wish you'd said saturday.

56
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:09,374
You have plans friday?
- No, i have plans saturday.

57
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,418
Please.

58
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:15,820
Oh, all right. So, does this mean
you're hoping to get lucky?

59
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:20,404
Please, nobody refers to having sex
as "getting lucky" any more.

60
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,354
I do.

61
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:27,183
- Hello, boys.
- hi, dad.

62
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:32,595
Would you like to join
maris and me friday night?

63
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:36,894
We're dying to try
the new rib joint on bellevue way.

64
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:41,547
If the onion rings aren't as big
as your head, you get them for free.

65
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:48,349
Thanks, but i thought i'd just spend
a quiet evening at home.

66
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:51,545
Oh, well...
why don't you come to our house?

67
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:55,951
We'll make dinner and we'll even rent
an angie dickinson film.

68
00:04:56,296 --> 00:05:00,653
What's going on? Frasier wants me
out of here because he's got a date?

69
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:04,843
I'm sorry,
he sees things that others don't.

70
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:08,695
I should have asked you myself.

71
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:11,728
I'll clear out, but remember,

72
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,580
one hand washes the other
around here.

73
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:19,566
- What does that mean?
- You can clear out for me thursday.

74
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:22,617
I got a date with elaine in 1412.

75
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:25,818
How long has this been going on?

76
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:30,747
She's had me over for coffee.
I'd like to have her over for dinner.

77
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:35,183
Niles, wipe that stupid smirk
off your face.

78
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,838
- What do you say?
- Terrific.

79
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:43,760
If there's a lull in the conversation
we've got board games, playing cards.

80
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:46,171
Does she play canasta?

81
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:50,502
And pbs has a documentary on
the swing bands of the '30s and '40s.

82
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:53,846
Thanks, boys.

83
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:58,143
We'll have creamed corn,
rub liniment into each other's joints...

84
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:01,600
and fall asleep drooling on the couch.

85
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:06,188
morning, daphne.

86
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:10,488
Morning. I want to thank you again
for the show last night.

87
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:15,027
I've never been
to experimental theatre before.

88
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:21,086
What did it mean when the naked man
came in carrying the suitcase?

89
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:27,095
Well, i think it meant
that he packed too much.

90
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:31,547
I'm sure your father
was glad to have us out.

91
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:34,842
What is that heavenly aroma?

92
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:38,581
Traditional english breakfast.

93
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:42,573
We have eggs
and bangers, or sausages,

94
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:46,417
and a batch
of grammy moon's famous sticky buns.

95
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,651
Oh, my, that's it!

96
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:52,537
Grammy used to add
a pint of rum to the recipe

97
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:56,181
and nobody liked these
more than grammy.

98
00:06:56,499 --> 00:07:01,129
I'd go to her house and find her
out in the garden in a wedding dress

99
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:04,337
face down in the birdbath.

100
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:06,748
- Morning!
- Morning, dad.

101
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:10,161
So... how was your date last night?

102
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:14,829
It feels strange, a son asking his father
how his date was last night...

103
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:19,356
...when he could ask the date herself.

104
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:24,766
Elaine, this is daphne,
my son frasier. This is elaine morris.

105
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:29,608
- Yes, hello.
- It's a pleasure to meet you.

106
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:33,908
I know dad's wanted
to have you for a long time.

107
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:39,443
I mean for dinner.

108
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:43,065
Well, i certainly enjoyed it.
But i should be going.

109
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,577
No, you should at least
stay for breakfast.

110
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:49,477
I could stay for coffee.

111
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:52,400
splendid, splendid.

112
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:57,026
What did you two kids do last night?

113
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:01,223
Did you play some games?
I mean, board games.

114
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:04,237
Not that you were bored... or excited.
Well...

115
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:08,155
not that i'd know anything or should,
but... warm buns, elaine.

116
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:11,446
No, not yours. I mean, ours, to eat.

117
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:15,336
Here, i'll have one. Mmm... warm.

118
00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:19,139
- Let's go sit at the table.
- Ok.

119
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:22,666
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- I don't know!

120
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:30,640
Frasier, i love your show. My friends
and i listen to it almost every day.

121
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:33,088
That's always lovely to hear.

122
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:39,485
 

123
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:45,491
- Elaine's a buyer at bon marché.
- I do a great deal of shopping there.

124
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:50,694
I bought the comforter on dad's bed.
I suppose you noticed that. Well...

125
00:08:52,574 --> 00:08:58,206
i don't know if you had the lights on or...
i don't know how you like it.

126
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:03,092
I mean, well, how you... light it.
Well, how you like to light it.

127
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:07,180
Oh, banger, dad?

128
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,554
I really should be going.
I've got to get ready for work.

129
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:18,881
It was nice meeting you, daphne,
and, uh, frasier.

130
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:23,013
- Thanks for a lovely evening, martin.
- I'll call you later.

131
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:25,949
You couldn't have served bacon?

132
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,666
Me? The way you were carrying on

133
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:32,333
we can be thankful
i didn't make toad in the hole.

134
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:37,032
You handled that smoothly, dr crane.

135
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:40,558
I'm sorry, dad.
It just caught me off guard.

136
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:45,369
Oh, that's ok,
i should have warned you, but...

137
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:49,623
but i really didn't think
it was going to happen.

138
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:53,321
Pretty glad it did.

139
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:58,280
- So you like elaine?
- I like elaine.

140
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:07,009
- So, dad...?
- Yeah, yeah.

141
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:10,227
You're back on the beat!

142
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:12,483
All right!

143
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:15,615
- Lock up your daughters!
- Yeah, ok.

144
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:17,898
- Oh, come on, you old...
- frasier, don't push it!

145
00:10:22,414 --> 00:10:26,885
We have marianne on line 4,
she's concerned about her daughter.

146
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:30,050
Hello, marianne. I'm listening.

147
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:32,294
'Kids, you can't live with them,

148
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:35,666
'you can't shove them
back in the womb.'

149
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:41,099
Well, as we try to forget
the image that summons up...

150
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:44,712
...how can i help you?

151
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:49,449
'My 22-year-old arrived home
for a visit with her boyfriend.

152
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:53,491
'I insisted they sleep
in separate bedrooms.

153
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:58,052
'She got furious. She's been upset with
me all week. Am i out of line here? '

154
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:03,118
- In your house you make up the rules.
- 'Thank you.'

155
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:07,125
But isn't there
something else here?

156
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:12,055
Perhaps you find it hard
to think of your daughter as an adult.

157
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:16,734
We all freeze people in roles
with which we are most comfortable,

158
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:20,529
especially when it comes
to that old bugaboo, sex.

159
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:23,361
Take me as an example.

160
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:26,360
My 63-year-old father

161
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:29,158
moved in with me
and this morning, over coffee,

162
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:33,910
i discovered he had spent the night
with a delightful creature named elaine.

163
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:40,989
It completely unnerved me
as i had never thought of my father

164
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:43,760
as a man with normal sexual urges.

165
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:49,111
To me, he was always just "dad".
Well, that's absurd.

166
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:52,299
He is a witty, virile, charming man,

167
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:56,216
possessed with the hereditary
crane good looks.

168
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,904
What i'm driving at is that sexuality

169
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:03,250
is a healthy part
of adulthood at any age.

170
00:12:03,598 --> 00:12:06,271
It's time we embraced that, right?

171
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:10,393
'Sorry, i've got to go. I'm hearing noises
from the guest room.'

172
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:14,689
As marianne rushes to the guest room
with a bucket of ice water,

173
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:18,302
we will pause for these messages.

174
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:23,387
- That was a good show.
- Thank you.

175
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:27,535
- Hi, dr crane. Hi, roz.
- Hi, noel.

176
00:12:27,831 --> 00:12:30,982
- I had a great time last night.
- Me, too.

177
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:33,726
I made you this spice rack.

178
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:41,587
I specially treated the back
for easy wall adhesion.

179
00:12:42,846 --> 00:12:45,679
That was very thoughtful of you, noel.

180
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:49,728
Well, um... i got to run.
I'll call you later.

181
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:52,291
Live long and prosper.

182
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:59,874
Oh, look, there's a place for cumin.
Most people overlook that.

183
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,188
Just kill me.

184
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:08,124
Why would he say it on the radio?

185
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:11,450
When you get angry,
your ears turn red.

186
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:15,177
See, there they go.

187
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:18,521
Good evening everyone.

188
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:21,392
I'll be going to me room right now.

189
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,760
Hello, eddie.

190
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:35,994
- I seem to have cleared the room.
- I want to talk to you, mister.

191
00:13:36,358 --> 00:13:39,077
And take me out behind the woodshed?

192
00:13:39,361 --> 00:13:43,274
Why were you talking about
my personal life on your programme?

193
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:47,574
- You mean about you and elaine?
- Damn right! I was so embarrassed!

194
00:13:47,911 --> 00:13:49,902
It was flattering.

195
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:53,599
Yeah, telling seattle about me
shacking up with a neighbour.

196
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:56,477
I thought you'd get a kick out of it.

197
00:13:56,753 --> 00:14:00,382
Knock it off.
Elaine won't even talk to me any more.

198
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:04,390
What for?
Simply because of a harmless remark?

199
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:08,507
People of our generation
think that sex is a private thing.

200
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:11,237
That's a healthy way of looking at it.

201
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:15,193
Sex is something between you
and the person you're doing it to!

202
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:23,549
Don't you think
she's overreacting a little?

203
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:30,211
She spends the night. Next,
it's being broadcast all over seattle.

204
00:14:30,662 --> 00:14:33,176
I mean,
her friends heard it and called her.

205
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:36,766
She won't go out
or answer the phone.

206
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:40,157
- I'm sorry.
- Your sympathy touches me

207
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:43,136
I caused the problem,
so i'll take care of it.

208
00:14:43,425 --> 00:14:46,383
I'll be in my room holding my breath.

209
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:56,900
I said i'd take care of it.

210
00:14:59,441 --> 00:15:02,194
I hate my voice.

211
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:07,764
'I know no one likes the sound
of their own voice, especially on tape,

212
00:15:08,158 --> 00:15:12,231
'it doesn't sound as good
as in their own head.

213
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:15,298
'But i hate my voice in my head, too.

214
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:18,938
'You can't get away
from your own voice.

215
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:22,528
'I tried not listening to myself
when i talk,

216
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:27,435
'but then i say things
that don't make a lot of sense.

217
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:30,521
'I hate my voice so much,

218
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:36,482
'i had to call a neighbour in to do the
message on my answering machine.

219
00:15:36,895 --> 00:15:41,605
'I don't like his voice much either
but it's better than mine.

220
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:45,293
'Not that i get a lot of calls, anyway.
Go figure.

221
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:48,410
'Any advice, dr crane? '

222
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:54,644
Just go on with what you're doing
and everything should turn out all right.

223
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:58,102
Thank you for your call.

224
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:04,624
Oh, i'd like to end today's show
on something of a personal note.

225
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:07,236
I'm talking to one person
in my audience.

226
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:10,182
Elaine.

227
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:14,986
You wouldn't answer my phone calls,
so i hope you're listening.

228
00:16:16,226 --> 00:16:20,105
I want to apologise
for what i said on the radio.

229
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:24,147
I took something private
and made it public.

230
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:28,272
I will never do that again,
well, except for this time.

231
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:31,081
Then i promise i'll never do it again.

232
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:36,645
The saddest thing is, elaine,
dad is paying for my mistake.

233
00:16:39,124 --> 00:16:41,080
 

234
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:51,840
Elaine,

235
00:16:53,555 --> 00:16:57,673
martin cares for you
and he misses you very much.

236
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:03,398
More than anything,
he'd like to be back together with you.

237
00:17:03,732 --> 00:17:08,362
And if you feel the same,
i hope you'll find it in your heart

238
00:17:08,737 --> 00:17:12,696
to come to my place tonight
at 8:00 for dinner...

239
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:17,072
a very romantic dinner.
Thanks, elaine.

240
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:22,744
This is kacl-780am, talk radio,

241
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:28,681
and i'm frasier crane...
the lo-ove doctor.

242
00:17:33,887 --> 00:17:37,004
# moon river... #

243
00:17:37,307 --> 00:17:41,459
the champagne is chilled,
a platter of hors d'oeuvres...

244
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:45,690
- the roast looks beautiful.
- I hope this works.

245
00:17:46,024 --> 00:17:48,902
I've been sending elaine
psychic messages.

246
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:53,721
You can transmit?
I thought you were just a receiver.

247
00:17:54,032 --> 00:17:56,262
I'm giving it a try.

248
00:17:56,534 --> 00:18:01,403
You know: "elaine in 1410,
come to dinner, come to dinner."

249
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:04,907
That's very charming,
but elaine is in 1412.

250
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:08,566
I'd better set an extra place
at the table, then.

251
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:14,557
- It's 8:00 and i'm still a pumpkin.
- It is two minutes to 8:00. relax.

252
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:17,722
She probably didn't hear your show.

253
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:21,450
- Does this tie go with the jacket?
- You look smashing.

254
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:24,123
Who am i kidding? She won't show up.

255
00:18:24,396 --> 00:18:26,307
 

256
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:29,158
Let's skip the first course,
which is crow,

257
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:31,398
and start with the hors d'oeuvres.

258
00:18:31,653 --> 00:18:33,689
Just answer the door.

259
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:39,100
Is this the crane residence?

260
00:18:39,369 --> 00:18:43,328
- Yes, it is.
- We've been here for 15 minutes.

261
00:18:43,665 --> 00:18:47,374
- Did elaine show up or not?
- Who are you?

262
00:18:47,711 --> 00:18:52,910
We heard your show, so romantic!
We all have our fingers crossed.

263
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:55,733
- That's kind.
- I'm marjorie from 11,

264
00:18:56,011 --> 00:19:00,163
this is norman,
these other people i don't know.

265
00:19:00,515 --> 00:19:02,471
Nice to see you all.

266
00:19:02,726 --> 00:19:05,479
Tony,
shouldn't you be watching the door?

267
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:10,321
We're all locked in.
I must find out how this ends, doc.

268
00:19:10,692 --> 00:19:13,650
- What's going on out here?
- Oh, is this martin?

269
00:19:13,945 --> 00:19:16,015
oh!

270
00:19:16,281 --> 00:19:18,237
People,
don't you have lives of your own?

271
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:21,449
Please, scoot! It's a private situation.

272
00:19:21,745 --> 00:19:24,134
 

273
00:19:25,332 --> 00:19:28,244
- That's her!
- Oh, my god!

274
00:19:28,543 --> 00:19:31,455
- Please, come out.
- No!

275
00:19:31,755 --> 00:19:37,227
Dad, you come in here. Ok, back off!
Just give us some time! Please!

276
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:41,071
I should never have come up.
Nothing's changed.

277
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:44,187
- Let me explain.
- You've done enough.

278
00:19:44,476 --> 00:19:46,865
- Frasier, over there.
- Dad...

279
00:19:47,145 --> 00:19:49,864
- turn around.
- Well, i...

280
00:19:50,148 --> 00:19:52,218
ah!

281
00:19:54,277 --> 00:19:58,429
I'm sorry about what happened.
You've got every right to be mad.

282
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:02,338
What we had was pretty good.

283
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:06,737
And thanks to radio boy here,
most of seattle agrees with me.

284
00:20:07,082 --> 00:20:10,791
I'd hate us to lose it
because of one stupid thing.

285
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:14,081
Come on, elaine.

286
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:18,048
I had a great time on our date.
Don't you feel the same way?

287
00:20:19,177 --> 00:20:23,295
You may not remember
but i have warm toes.

288
00:20:27,394 --> 00:20:32,422
It's your choice, but i sure wish
you'd come and have dinner with me.

289
00:20:32,816 --> 00:20:35,046
 

290
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:52,032
Who said you could turn around?

291
00:20:54,337 --> 00:20:56,453
Look, it's coming back up!

292
00:20:57,424 --> 00:20:59,858
oh!

293
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:06,782
All right, you've had your fun.
Show is over. Go back to your homes.

294
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:09,139
Please folks.
Honour what the man says.

295
00:21:09,394 --> 00:21:12,113
Thank you so much for your concern.

296
00:21:12,397 --> 00:21:16,185
Let's expedite this departure,
if you would. Thank you so much.

297
00:21:16,526 --> 00:21:18,278
Goodbye.

298
00:21:18,528 --> 00:21:23,477
- We should give them their privacy.
- Yes, i suppose you're right.

299
00:21:23,867 --> 00:21:27,416
It's ironic: My 63-year-old father

300
00:21:27,746 --> 00:21:30,180
is about to embark
on a night of romance,

301
00:21:30,457 --> 00:21:36,805
while the two of us, a man and woman,
both attractive and eligible,

302
00:21:37,255 --> 00:21:41,089
in the prime of our lives,
with nothing to do on a saturday night.

303
00:21:42,344 --> 00:21:46,383
The answer to our problems
might be right under our noses.

304
00:21:47,891 --> 00:21:50,166
Yes, daphne, i think it is.

305
00:21:50,435 --> 00:21:54,872
All right, you go claim the washing
machines. I'll go get the laundry.

306
00:22:05,283 --> 00:22:07,194
# Hey, baby, i hear the blues a-calling

307
00:22:07,452 --> 00:22:10,250
# tossed salads and scrambled eggs

308
00:22:10,538 --> 00:22:12,017
# mercy!

309
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:14,557
# And maybe i seem a bit confused

310
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:17,109
# yeah, maybe, but i got you pegged!

311
00:22:19,381 --> 00:22:21,178
# But i don't know what to do with those

312
00:22:21,424 --> 00:22:24,257
# tossed salads and scrambled eggs

313
00:22:26,346 --> 00:22:28,940
# they're calling again

314
00:22:29,224 --> 00:22:33,183
# scrambled eggs all over my face
what is a boy to do? #

315
00:22:35,897 --> 00:22:37,216
thank you!
