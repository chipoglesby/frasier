1
00:00:07,974 --> 00:00:09,930
Here you go, doc... your usual.

2
00:00:10,186 --> 00:00:12,063
How lovely it is to have a usual.

3
00:00:15,155 --> 00:00:18,067
- What is this?
- Latte with nutmeg and cinnamon.

4
00:00:18,369 --> 00:00:21,725
That's my brother's usual.
I'm the double kona with cream.

5
00:00:23,463 --> 00:00:25,738
Oh, frasier - am i glad to see you.

6
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:28,570
- Your usual, doc?
- Please.

7
00:00:32,314 --> 00:00:34,066
Thank you.

8
00:00:34,861 --> 00:00:38,012
Niles, you seem more than usually
agitated today. A problem?

9
00:00:38,326 --> 00:00:40,442
I'm meeting my publisher here.

10
00:00:40,706 --> 00:00:43,266
Remember my book deal you envied?

11
00:00:43,545 --> 00:00:45,615
I wasn't jealous, niles.

12
00:00:45,883 --> 00:00:48,556
Well, the deal's about to be killed.

13
00:00:48,847 --> 00:00:51,600
My idea had already been done.

14
00:00:51,895 --> 00:00:56,605
I need to find an alternative today
and i've got bubkis - less than bubkis.

15
00:00:56,988 --> 00:01:00,617
I've got what bubkis keeps for lint
in the bottom of his pocket.

16
00:01:00,955 --> 00:01:04,664
- Can you ask for an extension?
- No, i've had two already.

17
00:01:05,004 --> 00:01:08,792
Oh, god, there he is.
Sam, so good to see you.

18
00:01:09,138 --> 00:01:12,733
- Niles.
- Sam tanaka, dr frasier crane.

19
00:01:13,062 --> 00:01:14,734
Nice to meet you.

20
00:01:14,983 --> 00:01:17,417
- Coffee?
- I'll have what he's having.

21
00:01:17,697 --> 00:01:19,608
So you shall.

22
00:01:19,868 --> 00:01:22,098
One more, please.

23
00:01:22,372 --> 00:01:26,763
- Wait, you're the doctor from the radio.
- Guilty as charged.

24
00:01:27,132 --> 00:01:30,090
- I listen to your show all the time.
- Oh, thank you.

25
00:01:30,388 --> 00:01:32,777
I never realized you two were brothers.

26
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,733
All our lives!

27
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:40,864
You must have incredible insight
into sibling relationships.

28
00:01:41,202 --> 00:01:44,592
No more than your average
psychiatrist brothers.

29
00:01:44,918 --> 00:01:47,557
So, niles, what's your idea?

30
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,308
 

31
00:01:50,595 --> 00:01:53,632
My idea - well, sam,
i've given it a lot of thought...

32
00:01:53,936 --> 00:01:57,451
- there may be a book in that.
- In what?

33
00:01:57,777 --> 00:02:02,567
Two psychiatrist brothers
writing about sibling relationships.

34
00:02:02,954 --> 00:02:07,470
That, sam, is exactly the idea
we were going to pitch to you!

35
00:02:07,839 --> 00:02:09,511
- What?!
- Terrific!

36
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,670
I hate to interrupt...

37
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:15,286
gentlemen,
i'm going to cancel my lunch date

38
00:02:15,603 --> 00:02:17,912
so i can take you two out to celebrate.

39
00:02:18,192 --> 00:02:22,470
Oh, well, we were
going to write today, but ok.

40
00:02:22,827 --> 00:02:25,785
What are you doing? I don't wanna
write a book. I'm outta here.

41
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:30,315
Frasier, i know it's asking a big favour,

42
00:02:30,676 --> 00:02:35,909
all my life i have dreamed of one thing -
the day i could go into a library

43
00:02:36,312 --> 00:02:40,066
and see my name
under "mental illness".

44
00:02:44,913 --> 00:02:48,622
The day i could finally feel
what you feel - that i'm somebody,

45
00:02:48,962 --> 00:02:52,477
not just one more
dusty little psychiatrist.

46
00:02:52,803 --> 00:02:54,873
Oh, niles...

47
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:59,054
we haven't collaborated since
the spring musicale in prep school.

48
00:02:59,399 --> 00:03:01,833
Yes, well, it was well received.

49
00:03:02,489 --> 00:03:05,367
It did get us out of gym class.

50
00:03:06,622 --> 00:03:10,171
- It could be like that again.
- I don't know, niles.

51
00:03:10,505 --> 00:03:14,418
# Um-ta, um-ta, um-ta, da-da-da-da

52
00:03:14,764 --> 00:03:18,473
# oh, some boys go to college
but we think they're all wussies

53
00:03:18,814 --> 00:03:24,366
# cos they get all the knowledge
and we get all the... um-ta, um-ta... #

54
00:03:24,784 --> 00:03:26,900
- all right, i'll do it!
- Yes!

55
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,325
 

56
00:03:32,758 --> 00:03:35,556
- Dumas frère!
- Dumas frère!

57
00:03:35,848 --> 00:03:40,524
- Hello, what are you doing over here?
- It's our first writing session.

58
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:44,893
- I thought that was at niles's house.
- Unfortunately, it's maris's turn

59
00:03:45,241 --> 00:03:49,280
to host her sherry-tasting group
and things get a little raucous.

60
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:54,460
- But the sonics are on in 20 minutes.
- I bought you these headphones.

61
00:03:54,844 --> 00:03:58,393
You'll be able to listen to the tv
without disturbing niles and me.

62
00:03:58,726 --> 00:04:01,718
How's eddie gonna hear?

63
00:04:03,946 --> 00:04:07,382
He can read about the game
in tomorrow's paper.

64
00:04:08,496 --> 00:04:10,612
Try them out there.

65
00:04:12,587 --> 00:04:15,545
hey, not bad!

66
00:04:16,178 --> 00:04:20,057
- Very clever solution.
- It also has another little feature.

67
00:04:20,395 --> 00:04:25,594
Watch this.
Hey, dad... nice shirt

68
00:04:26,532 --> 00:04:29,968
Did they throw that in the last time
you had your tyres rotated

69
00:04:32,795 --> 00:04:35,229
Tell us about
when you met eisenhower.

70
00:04:35,508 --> 00:04:37,817
We haven't heard that story this hour

71
00:04:40,393 --> 00:04:43,430
Ok. My turn. Hey, dad...

72
00:04:43,733 --> 00:04:47,726
say another word
and i'll club you both with my cane.

73
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:54,495
This is great, thanks a lot.

74
00:04:54,755 --> 00:04:56,746
Watch out for this for me, eddie.

75
00:04:57,177 --> 00:05:00,135
I got to get a snack. Who wants a beer?

76
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:02,424
Just you.

77
00:05:02,687 --> 00:05:06,123
This is no time to procrastinate.

78
00:05:06,445 --> 00:05:08,197
Ok, here we go.

79
00:05:08,449 --> 00:05:12,158
Chapter one, page one, paragraph one.

80
00:05:12,499 --> 00:05:14,455
I'm indenting!

81
00:05:18,302 --> 00:05:21,021
I hate to squash your enthusiasm,

82
00:05:21,308 --> 00:05:26,143
but shouldn't we discuss
what the book is going to be about?

83
00:05:27,487 --> 00:05:31,480
Forgive me for just barrelling
ahead, but damn it, i'm jazzed!

84
00:05:33,749 --> 00:05:36,821
We have to approach this book
from a completely different angle

85
00:05:37,132 --> 00:05:40,408
than all of our previous writing -
our dissertations, our theses.

86
00:05:40,722 --> 00:05:43,190
Right. This has to be interesting.

87
00:05:45,189 --> 00:05:48,022
The obvious approach is case histories.

88
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,791
Anecdotes about siblings
we've dealt with in our practice.

89
00:05:53,164 --> 00:05:57,077
If we throw in a few heaving bosoms
we'll make book of the month club.

90
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:02,926
I could tell you a couple
of stories about you guys.

91
00:06:03,267 --> 00:06:07,101
That's an interesting idea.
We'll use ourselves in the introduction.

92
00:06:07,442 --> 00:06:09,398
I like the introduction idea.

93
00:06:09,654 --> 00:06:12,771
Give us your best story
- the one with little niles

94
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:16,071
and little frasier at their conflicted best.

95
00:06:17,295 --> 00:06:21,732
When we went trout fishing,
you guys were at it tooth and nail.

96
00:06:22,097 --> 00:06:24,895
- This is good.
- What's the lake called?

97
00:06:25,186 --> 00:06:27,063
The name is immaterial.

98
00:06:27,315 --> 00:06:30,034
It's an indian word,
lake watchahatchee?

99
00:06:30,321 --> 00:06:34,758
- You're missing the point.
- Your mother knew but she's dead.

100
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:40,330
Watchakootchie? Coochawatchie?
It was an indian word.

101
00:06:40,675 --> 00:06:43,667
- It meant "land of a thousand..."
- dad...

102
00:06:43,974 --> 00:06:46,966
this is driving me nuts.
I have to look it up.

103
00:06:47,272 --> 00:06:51,663
- We just want the story.
- Where the hell did i put my atlas?

104
00:06:53,242 --> 00:06:57,360
- Quite a resource, isn't he
- We'll just put the introduction on hold.

105
00:06:57,709 --> 00:06:59,825
Back to case histories.

106
00:07:00,089 --> 00:07:03,320
I suppose i could get my files
out of storage after the...

107
00:07:04,514 --> 00:07:07,586
niles,
is there a light bulb over my head?

108
00:07:09,232 --> 00:07:13,942
- You have an idea?
- No, is there actually a light bulb

109
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:20,580
Of course i have an idea!
What better source than my show?

110
00:07:20,964 --> 00:07:23,432
I'll ask listeners to call in with stories

111
00:07:23,719 --> 00:07:26,791
of sibling conflict
and you can be my guest.

112
00:07:27,101 --> 00:07:31,094
You're suggesting we exploit
your listeners for our own gain?

113
00:07:32,237 --> 00:07:34,148
In essence, yes.

114
00:07:35,576 --> 00:07:39,251
- What do you think?
- It's borderline sleazy. Go for it.

115
00:07:48,269 --> 00:07:50,146
Hello, roz.

116
00:07:50,398 --> 00:07:53,834
- What's your brother doing here?
- He's going to be my guest.

117
00:07:54,156 --> 00:07:56,033
I don't think so.

118
00:07:56,285 --> 00:08:00,801
I am the producer, and i approve
the guests. I do not approve him.

119
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:04,640
- Ok, bye-bye, have a good show.
- Ok, he's approved.

120
00:08:05,094 --> 00:08:09,167
But i will not get him coffee
and i'm not taking any of his crapola.

121
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:12,955
Niles, welcome aboard.
Five seconds to air.

122
00:08:13,277 --> 00:08:18,351
Ok, niles - sit down, take a deep
breath, try not to spit on the mike.

123
00:08:18,746 --> 00:08:21,419
Right.

124
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:25,180
Hello, seattle. This is dr frasier crane.
I have a very special guest today,

125
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:28,707
my brother,
the eminent psychiatrist dr niles crane.

126
00:08:29,017 --> 00:08:32,726
Hello, emerald city!
What's doin', what's happenin'?

127
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:39,835
What do you think you're doing?

128
00:08:40,122 --> 00:08:43,159
That was my radio persona.
Every great radio personality has one.

129
00:08:43,462 --> 00:08:45,612
- I don't.
- My point exactly.

130
00:08:47,428 --> 00:08:49,498
Just try to be yourself.

131
00:08:49,766 --> 00:08:53,076
Our topic today is siblings -

132
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:55,913
what makes you love them,
hate them...

133
00:08:56,196 --> 00:08:58,505
what things do they do to annoy you?

134
00:08:58,784 --> 00:09:02,174
These could be things
from your childhood or adolescence,

135
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:06,459
- your young adulthood...
- or...

136
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,839
they could be things
that are going on right now!

137
00:09:11,184 --> 00:09:14,654
- Roz, who's our first caller?
- Donald from bainbridge island.

138
00:09:14,983 --> 00:09:18,373
He hasn't spoken to his brother
in 20 years.

139
00:09:18,699 --> 00:09:23,056
- Hello, donald, i'm...
...listening.

140
00:09:24,878 --> 00:09:27,438
We're listening.

141
00:09:28,928 --> 00:09:33,001
(woman) 'i'll never forget it.
I cried for two hours straight.'

142
00:09:33,354 --> 00:09:35,265
So you were completely bald?

143
00:09:35,524 --> 00:09:38,561
'Yes, the perm destroyed my hair.'

144
00:09:38,864 --> 00:09:42,652
'I was sure my sisters were gonna
laugh at me but they all kissed me.

145
00:09:42,997 --> 00:09:47,673
'Then they shaved their heads too,
so i wouldn't feel like a freak.'

146
00:09:50,221 --> 00:09:53,418
Amazing!
Well, there you have it, seattle -

147
00:09:53,727 --> 00:09:56,116
the miracle of the sibling relationship

148
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,631
spelled out in an unselfish act
of head-shaving.

149
00:10:00,825 --> 00:10:05,580
Time's up. I'd like to thank
my brother for being here today.

150
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:09,032
Niles, i would shave my head for you.

151
00:10:10,219 --> 00:10:14,007
A gesture which becomes less
significant with each passing year.

152
00:10:18,736 --> 00:10:20,966
This is dr frasier crane.

153
00:10:21,241 --> 00:10:25,678
I'll be back tomorrow -
one crane flying solo.

154
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:32,134
Frasier, we've hit the mother iode.
We've material here for two volumes.

155
00:10:32,472 --> 00:10:35,509
I apologize for criticizing
your radio programme.

156
00:10:35,811 --> 00:10:37,767
All water under the pont neuf.

157
00:10:38,024 --> 00:10:41,699
I hate to break this up
but there's a sam tanaka on line one.

158
00:10:43,661 --> 00:10:47,654
- Hello, sam, you're on speakerphone.
- 'I caught the show today, fellows.'

159
00:10:48,002 --> 00:10:49,879
You did? And?

160
00:10:50,131 --> 00:10:52,087
'Magic!

161
00:10:53,764 --> 00:10:56,881
- 'How's the writing coming? '
- Flowing like water.

162
00:10:57,188 --> 00:10:59,543
We've got two or three
chapters already.

163
00:10:59,818 --> 00:11:03,857
'That's good because i just got off
the phone with "reader's digest".

164
00:11:04,202 --> 00:11:07,717
'They're interested
in the serialization rights.

165
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:12,399
'I need first few chapters to give
them a taste. Can you fax them? '

166
00:11:13,804 --> 00:11:17,956
Well, sam, uh, of course we could,
but they're a little rough.

167
00:11:18,313 --> 00:11:21,510
'No problem.
You've got till friday to polish them up.

168
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,776
'You can do that, right? '

169
00:11:24,033 --> 00:11:26,388
- Absolutely.
- Friday's fine.

170
00:11:26,663 --> 00:11:29,780
'Terrific! I love you guys! '

171
00:11:30,086 --> 00:11:32,600
What are we gonna do?

172
00:11:32,884 --> 00:11:34,920
We just have to put
the material together.

173
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:38,934
- It's due on friday.
- Then we'll do it by friday!

174
00:11:39,272 --> 00:11:44,062
Wait. George and ira gershwin
would lock themselves in a hotel room

175
00:11:44,449 --> 00:11:47,600
and not come out
until their task was complete.

176
00:11:47,914 --> 00:11:50,269
Brilliant! After this volume

177
00:11:50,544 --> 00:11:53,502
we can write another chorus to
"bess, you is my woman now".

178
00:11:55,638 --> 00:12:00,029
It's clean, it's spartan,
totally devoid of charm.

179
00:12:00,398 --> 00:12:04,277
- It's perfect. Let's get to work.
- I'm with you, mon frère.

180
00:12:04,614 --> 00:12:07,686
We cannot be intimidated
by the tyranny of the blank page.

181
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:11,633
All we need to get a good start here

182
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:16,198
- is room service!
- Frasier!

183
00:12:16,555 --> 00:12:20,946
All right. All we need
is a good opening sentence -

184
00:12:21,314 --> 00:12:24,909
something that will smack
the reader right between the eyes

185
00:12:25,238 --> 00:12:29,595
and take him on a roller coaster ride
of self-awareness and discovery.

186
00:12:29,956 --> 00:12:33,471
Frasier, while you're mixing
metaphors, i've had a breakthrough.

187
00:12:36,636 --> 00:12:39,548
Voilà! Our opening sentence

188
00:12:39,851 --> 00:12:42,126
"from romulus and remus
to the lennon sisters,

189
00:12:42,398 --> 00:12:47,426
"sibling relationships have sparked
psychological debate worldwide."

190
00:12:47,825 --> 00:12:50,544
- Hmm... interesting.
- You like it?

191
00:12:50,831 --> 00:12:52,867
I said it was interesting.

192
00:12:53,127 --> 00:12:57,325
The question is whether we'd like
an interesting opening or a good one.

193
00:13:00,058 --> 00:13:03,607
- Just because you didn't think of it.
- I never liked romulus or remus,

194
00:13:03,941 --> 00:13:08,298
and the "lennon sisters" reference
is from the freaking moon.

195
00:13:08,659 --> 00:13:11,776
If you can do better, be my guest.

196
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:14,642
- I will.
- All right.

197
00:13:17,092 --> 00:13:19,731
My fingers are poised over the keys.

198
00:13:27,989 --> 00:13:29,945
I'm waiting.

199
00:13:37,925 --> 00:13:40,723
I'm still waiting.

200
00:13:41,015 --> 00:13:43,529
Oh, all right. Put this down.

201
00:13:43,812 --> 00:13:46,770
"The key
to a good sibling relationship

202
00:13:47,068 --> 00:13:50,060
"is the ability
to be open and honest."

203
00:13:51,285 --> 00:13:53,799
- That actually sounded good to me.
- Well, put that in there.

204
00:13:54,082 --> 00:13:58,121
"The key to a good sibling relationship
is the ability to be open and honest...

205
00:13:58,467 --> 00:14:03,257
"while still respecting
each other's boundaries."

206
00:14:04,646 --> 00:14:08,116
What are you doing?
What was that crap about boundaries?

207
00:14:08,445 --> 00:14:10,754
I was just finishing the thought.

208
00:14:11,033 --> 00:14:14,867
The thought was finished.
It didn't need finishing.

209
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:17,517
- I think it's better this way.
- I don't.

210
00:14:17,797 --> 00:14:19,867
- I'm at the keyboard.
- Let me type.

211
00:14:20,134 --> 00:14:23,206
- I need the keyboard.
- You ruined a good opening sentence!

212
00:14:23,517 --> 00:14:27,112
- It was an incomplete thought.
- Oh, you're an incomplete thought!

213
00:14:28,944 --> 00:14:32,823
- What happened to the iced tea?
- I finished that, too.

214
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:47,228
 

215
00:14:47,481 --> 00:14:50,598
Niles, i've just had an epiphany.

216
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:56,142
Oh, wonderful -
we could use a second sentence

217
00:14:56,499 --> 00:14:59,377
No, it's not for the book.

218
00:14:59,672 --> 00:15:04,700
I just realized why so many writers
become bloated, alcoholic suicides.

219
00:15:06,143 --> 00:15:08,498
No, don't type that in.

220
00:15:08,774 --> 00:15:12,926
I'm not.
I'm adding up our tab from the mini-bar.

221
00:15:14,619 --> 00:15:18,851
- We now owe $232.
- Oh, dear god!

222
00:15:19,211 --> 00:15:22,920
Well, you ate the jar
of macadamia nuts.

223
00:15:23,261 --> 00:15:26,697
No, it's dawn! It's friday!

224
00:15:27,018 --> 00:15:31,409
Admit it. We can't work together.
There's never gonna be any book.

225
00:15:31,945 --> 00:15:36,223
- Not with that attitude.
- Oh, get off it! The fat lady has sung.

226
00:15:36,579 --> 00:15:40,254
The curtain has been rung down.
I'll type it for you.

227
00:15:42,633 --> 00:15:44,703
"It's oover"?

228
00:15:45,848 --> 00:15:47,964
Let's go home.

229
00:15:48,227 --> 00:15:51,981
I guess i shouldn't be surprised
you'd give up so easily.

230
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:57,154
It's not your dream. Why should it be,
mr big-shot radio host?

231
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:03,933
Oh, is that what this tantrum is about?
You're jealous of my celebrity?

232
00:16:04,343 --> 00:16:08,780
It's not a tantrum and i'm not jealous.
I'm just fed up!

233
00:16:11,524 --> 00:16:14,436
Fed up with always being second.

234
00:16:14,739 --> 00:16:19,210
I wanted to be a psychiatrist like mom
way before you did, but you were older.

235
00:16:19,582 --> 00:16:23,177
You got married first.
You had a child first.

236
00:16:23,507 --> 00:16:26,817
By the time i get around to doing
anything it's all chewed meat!

237
00:16:27,138 --> 00:16:31,290
- It's something we can't change.
- Oh, you love it!

238
00:16:31,648 --> 00:16:35,277
- Oh, let it go, niles.
- My nose is rubbed in it every day.

239
00:16:35,614 --> 00:16:39,289
I'm on the board
of the psychiatric association.

240
00:16:39,622 --> 00:16:42,739
Four of my patients
have been elected to political office.

241
00:16:43,045 --> 00:16:46,162
But it's your big, fat face
they put on the side of buses!

242
00:16:46,468 --> 00:16:48,777
I do not have a fat face!

243
00:16:49,057 --> 00:16:53,130
I keep wondering how long you're
gonna store those nuts for winter.

244
00:16:55,278 --> 00:16:58,190
Well, at least i'm not spindly!

245
00:16:58,535 --> 00:17:01,368
- Who're you calling spindly?
- You!

246
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:03,941
- Fat face!
- Spindly!

247
00:17:04,212 --> 00:17:07,090
- You take that back!
- You make me!

248
00:17:07,385 --> 00:17:09,421
I will! Here's making you!

249
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:18,686
Here's your fat face! Give me that!

250
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:27,293
Niles! Niles! Stop it!
We're psychiatrists, not pugilists!

251
00:17:29,847 --> 00:17:31,917
I can't believe you fell for that!

252
00:17:38,782 --> 00:17:41,979
My god, i'm having a flashback!

253
00:17:42,288 --> 00:17:45,200
You're climbing in my crib
and jumping on me!

254
00:17:45,503 --> 00:17:48,620
You stole my mommy!

255
00:17:50,722 --> 00:17:54,476
Oh, my god, niles!
I got to get out of here.

256
00:17:54,814 --> 00:17:58,011
This entire idea has been a fiasco.

257
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,437
I should have never agreed. Goodbye!

258
00:18:07,005 --> 00:18:09,200
- Good morning, all.
- Morning.

259
00:18:09,468 --> 00:18:12,221
- You seem chipper.
- And why shouldn't i be?

260
00:18:12,515 --> 00:18:14,585
Well, it's gonna rain,
the jobless rate's up,

261
00:18:14,854 --> 00:18:17,288
and eddie was just licking that muffin.

262
00:18:20,908 --> 00:18:22,546
Doorbell

263
00:18:22,787 --> 00:18:25,142
i'll get it.

264
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:28,806
A mature man knows
he cannot control his circumstances,

265
00:18:29,132 --> 00:18:33,011
- only his response.
- You talked to your brother yet?

266
00:18:33,349 --> 00:18:36,182
I do not have a brother!
I'm an only child.

267
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,436
Oh, hello, dr crane.

268
00:18:38,693 --> 00:18:40,888
Hello, daphne... dad.

269
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:45,185
What are you doing here?

270
00:18:45,456 --> 00:18:49,608
Dad, i would like you to convey
a message from me to frasier.

271
00:18:51,093 --> 00:18:54,290
What makes you think
i know where he is?

272
00:18:59,234 --> 00:19:03,386
He owes me half this hotel bill.
I will accept no cheques.

273
00:19:03,743 --> 00:19:06,860
I know he has trouble writing things

274
00:19:08,879 --> 00:19:13,316
- I'm not paying any of this.
- So, you're cheap and stupid.

275
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:17,514
- And you're a no-talent hack!
- And you look stupid in a t-shirt!

276
00:19:17,855 --> 00:19:21,609
All right, that's enough.
Sit down and listen to me.

277
00:19:21,946 --> 00:19:23,902
Sit down.

278
00:19:25,536 --> 00:19:27,492
Sit down.

279
00:19:29,377 --> 00:19:33,768
I never had a brother, but i had
a partner once - mitch gossett.

280
00:19:34,137 --> 00:19:37,095
Big bear of a guy, arms like tree trunks.

281
00:19:37,393 --> 00:19:39,827
We'd go to ball games.
We played cards,

282
00:19:40,107 --> 00:19:42,667
and this was after
working all day together.

283
00:19:42,947 --> 00:19:45,415
- That's nice, but...
- just listen to me.

284
00:19:47,413 --> 00:19:52,806
Three months into our partnership,
goss and i got assigned to a stakeout -

285
00:19:53,217 --> 00:19:59,292
three days in the front of a chevy nova,
drinking too much coffee.

286
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:03,518
Pretty soon we started
getting on each other's nerves.

287
00:20:03,864 --> 00:20:07,061
Because he was a big,
egotistical fat face?

288
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,657
Because we were human.

289
00:20:11,921 --> 00:20:15,630
He didn't like this about me,
i didn't like that about him. It got ugly.

290
00:20:15,971 --> 00:20:17,927
When the stakeout ended,

291
00:20:18,183 --> 00:20:20,856
goss requested a transfer,
and that was fine by me.

292
00:20:22,818 --> 00:20:26,936
Three months later,
he was stabbed breaking up a bar fight.

293
00:20:27,285 --> 00:20:30,038
By the time i got to the hospital,
it was too late.

294
00:20:32,378 --> 00:20:35,654
Take what you want
from this story, boys.

295
00:20:35,969 --> 00:20:39,245
All i know is, it ain't worth it.

296
00:20:40,896 --> 00:20:43,456
Excuse me. I think i need a hanky.

297
00:20:43,734 --> 00:20:47,010
Frasier, isn't there something
you want to say to your brother?

298
00:20:48,661 --> 00:20:51,539
Yes, dad, i suppose there is.

299
00:20:53,587 --> 00:20:55,862
Niles, would you like a muffin?

300
00:21:02,063 --> 00:21:05,180
- Frasier!
- Oh, all right.

301
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:11,075
Niles,

302
00:21:11,331 --> 00:21:14,289
i'm sorry things
didn't work out with the book.

303
00:21:14,587 --> 00:21:17,897
You have no reason
to feel inferior to me.

304
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:22,008
You're an accomplished psychiatrist,
a decent man,

305
00:21:22,353 --> 00:21:25,026
and you stand second to no one.

306
00:21:26,946 --> 00:21:29,414
Thank you, frasier.

307
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:34,693
The truth is, i've always
looked up to you and admired you.

308
00:21:35,046 --> 00:21:37,321
Enough of this mushy, girly stuff.

309
00:21:37,592 --> 00:21:41,983
Just shake hands, punch each other
on the shoulder and be done with it.

310
00:21:43,938 --> 00:21:48,090
- Oh, what the heck!
- Oh, jeez!

311
00:21:51,829 --> 00:21:53,785
 

312
00:21:54,042 --> 00:21:58,399
- What are you crying about?
- I keep thinking about poor goss.

313
00:21:58,759 --> 00:22:01,717
It must be so hard on you
carrying all that pain around.

314
00:22:02,016 --> 00:22:05,326
There was no goss. I made him up.

315
00:22:05,648 --> 00:22:08,481
Well, at least there's one
good writer in this family.

316
00:22:13,789 --> 00:22:18,624
# Hey, baby, i hear the blues a-calling
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

317
00:22:19,509 --> 00:22:20,703
# mercy!

318
00:22:20,929 --> 00:22:25,639
# And, maybe i seem a bit confused
well, maybe... but i got you pegged!

319
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:32,820
# But i don't know what to do with those
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

320
00:22:33,955 --> 00:22:37,231
# they're calling again
good night, everybody! #
