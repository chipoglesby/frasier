00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:09,949
You're listening to KACL,

2
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:12,421
780 on your AM dial.

3
00:00:12,887 --> 00:00:14,843
This is Dr Frasier Crane.

4
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:17,976
Our lines are open.
So please give us a call.

5
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:22,420
l'm just sitting here waiting.

6
00:00:23,898 --> 00:00:27,095
Seattle, come on,
l know you're out there.

7
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:29,472
l realise it's a sunny day,

8
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:32,571
but on the rainy days
l was there for you.

9
00:00:35,326 --> 00:00:39,717
All right, if that's the way you want it,
you leave me no recourse.

10
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:44,950
# When the moon hits your eye
Like a big pizza... #

11
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:49,250
Ah, seems l got you going there, OK!
All right, then.

12
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:51,582
l knew you were out there.

13
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:53,993
OK, Roz, who do we have?

14
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:58,050
We have Gary on line two.
He and his wife had a fight.

15
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:01,827
Sorry to hear that, Gary. l'm listening.

16
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:05,854
'My wife's hell-bent
on going to ltaly this year.'

17
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:08,341
Ah, ltalia!

18
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:12,683
The rolling hills of Toscana,
the art of Firenze,

19
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:16,182
the passion that is Venezia!

20
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:21,772
'Yeah, well, anyway, l like taking
a vacation as much as the next guy,

21
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:24,121
'but if we dip into our savings,

22
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:29,166
'we should buy a new sump pump
for the basement...'

23
00:01:29,547 --> 00:01:33,256
Let me stop you there.
l'm siding with your wife here.

24
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:39,145
'But it's 1,800 bucks, without
the Splendours of the Vatican package.'

25
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:43,311
There is more to life than sump pumps.

26
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:46,034
Whatever happened
to feeding our souls?

27
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:51,547
l purchased a painting
by one of our premier artists.

28
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:56,810
Oh, it's not important who.
Well, it's Seattle's own Martha Paxton.

29
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:59,531
Practical, no, but...

30
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:03,779
Ever since acquiring that painting,
l look at it every day

31
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:07,560
and every time l do,
l'm uplifted by its beauty.

32
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:10,710
So, Gary, go to ltaly.

33
00:02:11,006 --> 00:02:14,362
Bring back a suitcase full of memories.
Will you do that?

34
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:18,385
'l still think
l should get the sump pump.'

35
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:23,477
Well, then yes, Gary, you...
You should get the sump pump.

36
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:27,594
We'll be right back
after this newsbreak.

37
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:33,885
Roz? Uh, just what is a sump pump?

38
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:36,235
lf you need one, you'll know.

39
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:40,448
Do you own a Paxton or were you
blowing sunshine up Gary's skirt?

40
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:45,461
- Yes, indeed, l do own a Paxton.
- She's on line three.

41
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:48,869
A pre-eminent neo-fauvist
and you put her on hold!

42
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,683
Well, the phone rang, l...

43
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:56,768
Ms Paxton, oh, l'm so sorry
to have kept you waiting.

44
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:59,049
Well, thank you!

45
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:03,343
Yes. l'm very flattered
that you listen to my little show.

46
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,799
Yes, l meant every word.

47
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:10,456
That's lovely.
l'd like to meet you, too, sometime.

48
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:16,132
l'm having a few friends over
for a little gathering this Friday night

49
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:18,520
for some cocktails and such.

50
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:23,173
l suppose you're far too...
You would? Oh, that's marvellous!

51
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:26,050
lt's the Elliott Bay Towers,

52
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:30,449
on the counterbalance,
around 7:00 is fine.

53
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:34,184
Well, l'll see you then.
Ciao!

54
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:39,416
- l didn't know about your cocktail party.
- That makes two of us.

55
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:52,527
Me theory on death is,
you're whisked down a dark tunnel

56
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:56,816
towards a white light and you
get all the jokes you never got before.

57
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:59,621
You let out a little chuckle
and then you die.

58
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:06,015
Delightful story, but l think
the toast points need replenishing.

59
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:08,327
Be right on it.

60
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,622
Enchanting.

61
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:14,674
Why is no-one eating
the mousseline of duck?

62
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:20,427
You mangy little cur!
Get! Get! Get! Oh!

63
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,955
Now we know why.

64
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:31,574
The dog is eating the food,
the pianist is too intrusive,

65
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:34,012
the Pinot Noir is far too stagy...

66
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:39,143
- lt's 7:05, and Martha isn't here.
- l won't have to sedate you, will l?

67
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:43,841
No, l'm just on edge.
l want everything to be perfect.

68
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,350
Where's Maris?
l haven't seen her all night.

69
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:50,578
She's on your bed...
asleep under the guests' coats.

70
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:57,009
She exhausts easily
under the pressure to be interesting.

71
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:03,842
- She should be looking after Dad!
- He's in the bathroom.

72
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:09,904
That must be... La Paxton!

73
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:13,541
And fashionably late, of course!

74
00:05:20,195 --> 00:05:22,345
Oh, hi, Roz, it's you.

75
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:25,333
- And you look radiant!
- l look like crap.

76
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:28,893
l stained my dress,
over-plucked one eyebrow,

77
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:33,322
and the crotch of my pantyhose
is creeping down to my knees.

78
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:40,210
Why not do it on the elevator?

79
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,803
Oh, my goodness,
you've got a neck!

80
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:50,680
What do you think?
ls it how you imagined?

81
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:54,968
To be frank, l don't spend
my idle hours imagining how you live.

82
00:05:56,189 --> 00:06:00,705
But l did expect lots of beige.
And look, l was right.

83
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,857
- Would you like a drink?
- Sure, something light.

84
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:08,432
Double bourbon, rocks,
and spill a little in the glass.

85
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:13,369
Oh, Daphne, you're here, too.

86
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:16,217
My goodness, shouldn't you be mixing?

87
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:19,459
Don't mind me.
l'm just getting some ice.

88
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:23,508
- Lovely party, isn't it?
- Yes, it is.

89
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:26,959
This fresh fennel smells wonderful,
doesn't it?

90
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:29,651
lt certainly does.

91
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:32,445
Dr Crane, were you sniffing my hair?

92
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:36,355
Why would l do that?
l'm married, l love my Maris.

93
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:41,204
- Where should l put this coat?
- Just throw it on the bed.

94
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:44,760
So, which one is your dad?

95
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:48,386
He's the gentleman showing
Bethany Van Pelt the photographs.

96
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,656
Oh, my God!

97
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:54,948
When we got to her,
it was hanging by two tendons.

98
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:59,897
Would you excuse us, please?

99
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:03,385
Stop showing crime scene photos.

100
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:06,745
She was the one who brought it up!

101
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:12,285
Oh, yeah, the Junior League head
brought up the subject of a hooker

102
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:16,277
who was dismembered
and scattered in a warehouse?

103
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:20,562
She asked, "Are these meatballs
the messiest thing you've ever seen?"

104
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:23,936
- And l said "no...
- Dad, please!

105
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:28,228
All right, but stop shadowing me!
l don't need a nursemaid!

106
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:31,087
All right, just give me your word.

107
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:33,404
Watch him!

108
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:37,806
Hi, Niles. You may not remember me...

109
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:41,355
l do! Be a love and watch
that man with a cane.

110
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:45,461
Everyone!

111
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:52,715
Dr Crane?

112
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:56,885
- l'm Martha Paxton.
- Of course. Who else could you be?

113
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:01,443
Welcome to my salon.

114
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:06,430
Everyone, your attention please!

115
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:12,368
Let's welcome our guest of honour,
the renowned artist, Martha Paxton!

116
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:21,149
- May l take your...poncho?
- No, l never take it off at parties.

117
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:25,502
- So l don't have to shake hands.
- How delightfully eccentric.

118
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:28,353
You must meet my brother Niles.
Oh, Niles!

119
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:34,386
Ms Paxton? Dr Niles Crane.
lt's an honour to shake your hand.

120
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:41,332
Well, to shake anything of yours
is an honour.

121
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:48,650
Now, where did you hang
my painting?

122
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:51,505
l'd like to know how people
live with my work.

123
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:56,571
"Live with my work."
l love that phrase. This way, please.

124
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:59,990
This is the perfect spot
for an ideal viewing. Oh, God...

125
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:05,284
l've waited so long for this moment.
l'll let you describe your work,

126
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,867
"Elegy ln Green," in your own words.

127
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:12,450
You insinuate the palette
but never lean on it.

128
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:15,355
You've captured the Zeitgeist!

129
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:19,233
lt's the most perfect canvas
l've gazed upon.

130
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:22,517
One can only imagine
what inspired you to paint it!

131
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:25,280
l didn't paint it.

132
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:33,119
Well, of course you didn't.
You created it, you gave birth to it.

133
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:38,924
l didn't do anything to it.
l never saw this painting before.

134
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:44,471
And you thought
l was going to embarrass you.

135
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:51,781
- l liked your friend, Roz.
- What?

136
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:55,687
Roz, at the party tonight.
Nice gal. Ask her out.

137
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:59,971
She's great-looking
and she can really hold her liquor.

138
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:03,857
Dad, you mind?
l've had the most humiliating evening.

139
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:07,896
l've been made a fool of
by this...this thing.

140
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:13,735
l may be just a girl from Manchester,
but l have to tell you.

141
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:17,303
Even though it's not a Paxton,
l really like it.

142
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:23,533
l liked it before l even knew
who Martha Paxton was and, frankly,

143
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:27,154
l don't think that woman bathes.

144
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:32,379
Enjoy it while you can,
because it's going back to the dealer.

145
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:34,672
l'll demand my money back.

146
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:37,076
No one takes advantage
of Frasier Crane!

147
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:40,223
You're upset. l'll return it for you.

148
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:45,191
l appreciate the gesture, but what
do you know about the art world?

149
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:48,872
Apparently about as much as you do.

150
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:01,687
l can see the love in your eyes.

151
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:06,678
You must have this painting.
- Are you the owner?

152
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,276
- Yes, l am, Philip Hayson.
- l'm Dr Frasier Crane.

153
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:14,660
- l have a little...
- The Dr Frasier Crane on the radio?

154
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:16,919
Guilty, yes.

155
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:20,294
My wife and l love your show.
Could l have your autograph?

156
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:25,466
But speaking of autographs,
l have a problem with this painting.

157
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:30,304
- Would you like a glass of wine?
- Actually...

158
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:35,676
We toured the Loire Valley
and we bought four cases of this.

159
00:11:36,071 --> 00:11:38,824
lt's quite extraordinary.

160
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:43,154
- l'd rather not have any wine...
- Just a moment, just...

161
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:48,838
- Oh, it finishes well.
- Would you like more?

162
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:56,676
No, thank you. l gave a small soiree
which Martha Paxton attended

163
00:11:57,175 --> 00:12:01,851
and she told me
that this painting was not her work.

164
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:05,180
l can imagine
how embarrassing that was.

165
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:09,354
- l doubt it.
- Let's take a look at that

166
00:12:09,688 --> 00:12:11,963
in a slightly better light, shall we?

167
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:17,294
Oh, yes, l remember this.
lt's breathtaking.

168
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:21,146
Ronald, Diane,
will you step in here?

169
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:26,682
Remember when this piece was in
the gallery, everyone wanted it?

170
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,196
Yes, it's special.

171
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:32,415
Mrs Chitcherelli wanted to buy it.

172
00:12:32,711 --> 00:12:35,783
Yes, but it's not a Paxton.

173
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:39,161
lt says here that it is a Paxton.
The signature...

174
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:44,309
Martha Paxton says it's not a Paxton!

175
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:48,510
- Oh, Martha! How is the old dear?
- She and l go back a long way.

176
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:53,368
- ls she still...?
- As a melon, yes.

177
00:12:53,732 --> 00:12:57,361
- More wine?
- No, l want to discuss this painting.

178
00:12:57,694 --> 00:13:01,892
- Some brie?
- No, l don't want any brie.

179
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,276
l want my money back!

180
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:08,846
That's where things
might just get a bit prickly.

181
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:13,164
We have a strict policy here.
All sales are final.

182
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:16,299
- You'll make an exception.
- l can't.

183
00:13:16,588 --> 00:13:21,184
- But it's a forgery.
- lf it is, it's a damn good one.

184
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:25,146
l'll make this simple,
l want my money.

185
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:27,667
l'm sure you do.

186
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:32,694
Oh, l know what you're doing.

187
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:35,937
You're agreeing with me,
hoping l'll tire and leave.

188
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:39,702
- Whatever you say.
- l don't believe it.

189
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:43,384
You're shining me on!

190
00:13:43,698 --> 00:13:46,166
Where is the justice in this?

191
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:53,163
lf you ever find justice in
this world, let me know, will you?

192
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:56,298
Now, if you'll excuse me,
l have some work to do.

193
00:13:56,586 --> 00:14:01,376
Did a crate of freshly painted
Rembrandts just arrive?

194
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:06,036
You're not getting away with this.
l am not leaving!

195
00:14:15,814 --> 00:14:18,169
l thought you
were going to return it.

196
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:21,001
They wouldn't take it back.

197
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:25,589
All l got was a cheap glass of wine.
Loire Valley, my ass.

198
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:32,205
- Now what?
- l'll call the police.

199
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:35,212
- 555-3000.
- Thanks.

200
00:14:36,668 --> 00:14:38,784
Try to mess with Dr Frasier Crane.

201
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:42,879
Hello... Oh, just a second.
Dad, who do l ask for?

202
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:46,128
Fine Arts Forgery Department.

203
00:14:46,428 --> 00:14:51,377
Hello, yes, the Fine Arts
Forgery Department, please.

204
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:03,615
Dad! They're laughing at me.

205
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:06,258
Give me the phone.

206
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:12,113
Hi, who's this?
Hey, Doris! Yeah, Marty Crane.

207
00:15:12,454 --> 00:15:14,410
Yeah, that was my son.

208
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:19,438
l just thought he needed
a bite of a reality sandwich.

209
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:25,191
Yeah, give my best to the guys.
Thanks. Yeah, bye.

210
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:29,301
- What was that?
- They handle murders and robberies.

211
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:31,673
No time for artsy-fartsy stuff.

212
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:35,446
What am l supposed to do?
l've been cheated!

213
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:43,158
What were you doing back there?

214
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:48,039
Maris lost her earring. Daphne crawled
under the bed to look for it while l...

215
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:50,158
Yes?

216
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:55,322
...searched the credenza.

217
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:58,936
Maybe it was trampled
into the hallway carpet

218
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,559
when everybody stampeded
for the elevator.

219
00:16:01,836 --> 00:16:06,671
No one stampeded!
Good guests just know when to leave.

220
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:09,723
- Two hours early.
- Shut up!

221
00:16:10,011 --> 00:16:15,165
Does this foul mood mean you were
unable to unload the bogus Paxton?

222
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:17,310
Yes.

223
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:21,439
What's the name
of that vicious lawyer you use?

224
00:16:21,773 --> 00:16:24,526
The one l used to sue the contractor
or to sue the personal trainer?

225
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:26,888
- The meanest.
- The second one.

226
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:31,783
- l used him to sue the first one.
- Give me his number.

227
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:37,186
Forget it. Five years of litigation
will be eight times the painting's price.

228
00:16:39,124 --> 00:16:43,117
- l hate lawyers!
- They make wonderful patients.

229
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:47,420
They have excellent health insurance
and they never get better.

230
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:55,143
l know, l can use my radio show.

231
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:58,783
l can use my bully pulpit to expose
that man for the fraud he is!

232
00:16:59,102 --> 00:17:01,662
They'll sue you for slander.

233
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:05,647
Where is the justice?
Where can l turn to?

234
00:17:05,984 --> 00:17:09,533
l'm a beloved household name
and l've been screwed!

235
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:13,333
You're 41.
lt's time you learned something.

236
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:15,569
The system ain't perfect.

237
00:17:15,827 --> 00:17:20,105
Sometimes the bad guy wins
and things you thought would help you,

238
00:17:20,457 --> 00:17:24,609
the courts and the police,
aren't there when you need them.

239
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:27,111
So let it eat a hole in your stomach

240
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:31,055
or file it away under the heading
"Sometimes life sucks".

241
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:35,263
That file's getting pretty thick.

242
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:43,055
So Hayson just gets away with it.

243
00:17:43,355 --> 00:17:49,112
He's sitting there with his wine
and his little chuckle at my expense.

244
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:52,325
l see why people
take matters into their own hands.

245
00:17:52,614 --> 00:17:54,730
lt would be so satisfying

246
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:59,030
to just slash his tyres
or throw a brick through his window!

247
00:17:59,371 --> 00:18:02,010
To show that you can't
get away with this.

248
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:06,078
l know you would never resort
to that sort of thing.

249
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:09,790
Would you, Frasier?

250
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:15,576
There's a vein
throbbing in your forehead.

251
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:21,492
l couldn't find it,
but l'll try something else.

252
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:25,526
Give me the other earring.
Maybe l'll get something.

253
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:30,212
Oh, yes, l'm getting a feeling.
lt's in your father's room.

254
00:18:30,568 --> 00:18:32,718
No, lt's in Dr Crane's room.

255
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:35,979
No... Oh, this is odd.
Now it's in the hallway.

256
00:18:38,827 --> 00:18:40,863
Eddie!

257
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:11,087
Good evening.
Lovely night, isn't it?

258
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:14,957
Yes, well, uh... Good night.

259
00:19:23,872 --> 00:19:26,705
- Get in the car.
- What are you doing here?

260
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,232
- Stopping you from being stupid.
- l know this is wrong,

261
00:19:31,588 --> 00:19:33,499
but it's the only thing left for me!

262
00:19:33,757 --> 00:19:38,672
All right, Frasier. Just give me
the brick and no one will get hurt.

263
00:19:39,054 --> 00:19:42,091
- lt's none of your business.
- lt is.

264
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:45,507
- How.
- Remember in school

265
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:49,086
when somebody took my clothes
while l showered?

266
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:51,752
They hung them from the goalpost.

267
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:56,974
l had to get a ladder and climb up there
wearing only a towel, wet and shivering.

268
00:19:57,364 --> 00:19:59,924
Then the towel fell off.

269
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:06,339
There l was, hanging naked from a
goalpost, and everyone was laughing,

270
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:11,860
and Coach Medwick just stood there
going... Whatever that means.

271
00:20:12,253 --> 00:20:14,369
Why are you telling me this?

272
00:20:14,631 --> 00:20:17,623
Because l was so humiliated.

273
00:20:17,926 --> 00:20:21,999
l went home, l cried my eyes out.
l swore l would get even.

274
00:20:22,347 --> 00:20:26,101
l was just about to put sugar
into Coach Medwick's gas tank,

275
00:20:26,434 --> 00:20:29,232
and you stopped me.

276
00:20:29,521 --> 00:20:34,470
You said, "lf you act like
a barbarian, you will become one."

277
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:39,216
l said that?
- Actually, you were more verbose.

278
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:43,326
l had to listen
while you were sitting on my chest.

279
00:20:45,495 --> 00:20:49,568
- Give me the brick, Frasier.
- And let him get away with this?

280
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:53,272
What the gallery owner did
was wrong and humiliating.

281
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:55,656
But if you throw that brick,

282
00:20:55,922 --> 00:20:59,119
you will have lost something
more valuable than your money.

283
00:20:59,426 --> 00:21:04,261
You will have lost...your mind.
You can't do this!

284
00:21:07,142 --> 00:21:11,021
lf you could show restraint
after so much humiliation,

285
00:21:11,354 --> 00:21:13,345
not to mention the nicknames...

286
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:18,236
- Nicknames. There were nicknames?
- You didn't know that?

287
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:24,083
Dear God. Peachfuzz, Jingle Bells...
l can't remember the rest.

288
00:21:24,492 --> 00:21:28,451
- "Peachfuzz"?
- Coach Medwick made that one up.

289
00:21:30,123 --> 00:21:33,832
Well, anyway, here you are.
l won't be needing this any more.

290
00:21:35,545 --> 00:21:37,581
l'm proud of you.

291
00:21:42,427 --> 00:21:46,420
- What have you done?
- Nobody calls me Peachfuzz!

292
00:21:46,765 --> 00:21:48,721
Now let's get the hell out of here!

293
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:51,879
What are you doing?

294
00:21:52,145 --> 00:21:55,217
We may be barbarians,
but we pay for our pillaging.

295
00:21:56,941 --> 00:21:59,375
Go! Go! Go! Go!

296
00:22:06,076 --> 00:22:07,953
# Baby, l hear the blues a-calling

297
00:22:08,203 --> 00:22:10,592
# Tossed salads and scrambled eggs

298
00:22:10,872 --> 00:22:11,827
# Oh, my

299
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:15,433
# Maybe l seem a bit confused

300
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:17,826
