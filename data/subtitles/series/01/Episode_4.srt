1
00:00:19,626 --> 00:00:20,901
Dad, he's doing it again.

2
00:00:21,226 --> 00:00:23,059
Must this dog stare at me all the time?

3
00:00:23,495 --> 00:00:25,464
I don't know. Eddie - must ya?

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,188
Apparently he must.

5
00:00:30,968 --> 00:00:33,011
What is so fascinating about me? What is it?

6
00:00:34,074 --> 00:00:36,773
In you eyes is my head a large piece of kibble?

7
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:41,589
Am I some sort of canine enigma?

8
00:00:43,723 --> 00:00:45,334
Think about it, get back to me.

9
00:00:46,445 --> 00:00:48,177
Here we are, gents, dinner's up.

10
00:00:48,369 --> 00:00:50,112
Can I give you a hand clearing up your papers?

11
00:00:50,113 --> 00:00:51,340
No, you better let me.

12
00:00:51,341 --> 00:00:53,190
I need to keep these in a particular order.

13
00:00:53,369 --> 00:00:54,644
What is all this, anyway?

14
00:00:54,887 --> 00:00:57,273
Oh, it's an old case of mine from the police force

15
00:00:57,274 --> 00:00:58,932
the "Weeping Lotus" murder.

16
00:00:59,351 --> 00:01:01,823
Dad, I can't believe you're still 
trotting this old thing up.

17
00:01:01,824 --> 00:01:03,831
He's been trying to solve this case for twenty years.

18
00:01:03,832 --> 00:01:06,086
Yeah, and I'm not stopping until I do solve it.

19
00:01:06,481 --> 00:01:08,321
You develop certain instincts 
when you're a cop.

20
00:01:08,625 --> 00:01:11,053
And my instinct tells me that 
this case can be cracked.

21
00:01:11,658 --> 00:01:14,423
There just must be one small thing 
I keep overlooking.

22
00:01:14,424 --> 00:01:16,696
There is - who the murderer was.

23
00:01:19,975 --> 00:01:21,950
It's nice you still so dedicated.

24
00:01:21,951 --> 00:01:23,357
It's a hobby.

25
00:01:23,358 --> 00:01:25,639
Some guys build a boat in their garage,

26
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,322
I try to figure out who a maniac 
would kill a hooker

27
00:01:28,323 --> 00:01:30,939
and try to stuff her entire body 
into a bowling bag.

28
00:01:31,256 --> 00:01:32,201
It's relaxing!

29
00:01:34,269 --> 00:01:36,238
- Hello, Niles.
- Sorry I'm late, Frasier.

30
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:41,777
Just as we were leaving, 
Maris had a run-in with a rude directory assistance operator 
and it shattered her calm.

31
00:01:43,172 --> 00:01:45,921
Have you ever considered that maybe 
Maris is a bit high strung?

32
00:01:45,922 --> 00:01:47,244
Maybe she should see someone.

33
00:01:47,245 --> 00:01:49,995
She's seen everyone, why do you think 
she was calling directory assistance?

34
00:01:51,939 --> 00:01:53,339
Evening, Dr. Crane.

35
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,501
Hello, Daphne. It's so good to see you again.

36
00:01:56,103 --> 00:01:57,642
What an enchanting scent you're wearing.

37
00:01:58,527 --> 00:02:00,030
Must be the ranch dressing.

38
00:02:01,652 --> 00:02:03,298
Won't Mrs. Crane be coming?

39
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:04,636
No, I'm afraid not.

40
00:02:04,637 --> 00:02:07,594
And please, no more of this "Doctor" 
and "Mrs. Crane" formality.

41
00:02:07,595 --> 00:02:09,707
To you, it's Niles and...

42
00:02:11,156 --> 00:02:12,664
- Maris.
- Yes, Maris.

43
00:02:15,737 --> 00:02:17,063
Glad you could join us, Niles.

44
00:02:17,064 --> 00:02:18,201
Oh, I wouldn't have missed it.

45
00:02:19,628 --> 00:02:22,344
Well, I guess the food's all ready: 
why don't we just go ahead and start?

46
00:02:22,744 --> 00:02:24,072
Well, enjoy.

47
00:02:24,073 --> 00:02:25,276
Where are you going?

48
00:02:25,277 --> 00:02:27,167
I thought I'd have mine in the kitchen.

49
00:02:27,168 --> 00:02:28,726
Don't be ridiculous.

50
00:02:28,727 --> 00:02:30,679
Yes, we can't have you eating 
by yourself in the kitchen.

51
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,589
I'll join you.

52
00:02:33,242 --> 00:02:36,641
No. We're all eating right here, 
like a family, end of discussion.

53
00:02:37,396 --> 00:02:41,219
Well, isn't this nice? Feels just like home.

54
00:02:41,566 --> 00:02:43,102
- I'm famished.
- Me, too.

55
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:46,279
You boys still say a prayer before you eat?

56
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,679
- Oh, yes...
- Yeah...

57
00:02:51,852 --> 00:02:54,248
We thank you, Lord, for the food we're about to eat.

58
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:57,650
You have blessed our table with your palm.

59
00:02:58,662 --> 00:03:05,420
And thank you, Lord, for bringing this family together 
and we also thank you for the other gifts 
you have given to us.

60
00:03:06,247 --> 00:03:09,432
And may we always be able to share 
with those less fortunate...

61
00:03:09,433 --> 00:03:10,680
OH, WILL YOU STOP STARING!

62
00:03:10,681 --> 00:03:11,603
I wasn't staring!

63
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:20,394
Amen.

64
00:03:26,016 --> 00:03:30,049
So Frasier, did you happen to read Derek Mann's column today? 
You were mentioned.

65
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:31,181
No, I missed it.

66
00:03:31,182 --> 00:03:32,675
Just as well, it wasn't flattering.

67
00:03:32,676 --> 00:03:34,478
Well, I still would have liked to have seen it anyway.

68
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:35,851
Oh, why didn't you say so?

69
00:03:38,745 --> 00:03:40,587
If I may ask, who's Derek Mann?

70
00:03:40,855 --> 00:03:43,254
He writes that "Mann About Town" column for the Times.

71
00:03:43,255 --> 00:03:46,599
The things that guys comes out with, 
sometimes he's really funny...

72
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,766
what did he say about you?

73
00:03:48,306 --> 00:03:50,146
"I hate Frasier Crane."

74
00:03:52,752 --> 00:03:54,171
Oh, sorry.

75
00:03:55,779 --> 00:03:58,157
That's it. "I hate Frasier Crane." That's it?

76
00:03:58,158 --> 00:03:59,350
Oh, don't let it bother you.

77
00:03:59,351 --> 00:04:00,830
Well, actually it doesn't, dad.

78
00:04:00,831 --> 00:04:04,321
I knew when I chose a career in the public eye 
that I'd be open to certain criticisms,

79
00:04:04,322 --> 00:04:06,098
it's the price I pay for my celebrity.

80
00:04:06,698 --> 00:04:09,164
Thank you, Niles, for bringing me the paper,

81
00:04:09,554 --> 00:04:12,018
and thank you for highlighting it in yellow!

82
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:17,791
Now, who would like some wine?

83
00:04:17,792 --> 00:04:19,059
Oh, I'll have some.

84
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,854
Daphne, the salad is exquisite.

85
00:04:20,855 --> 00:04:22,520
Now why would he say that?

86
00:04:22,521 --> 00:04:24,338
Must be the carrots, he always did like them.

87
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:27,111
Not the salad, Derek Mann.

88
00:04:27,858 --> 00:04:30,236
I mean, why would he write a thing like that?

89
00:04:30,237 --> 00:04:33,912
I've never done anything to him, 
the attack is totally unwarranted.

90
00:04:33,913 --> 00:04:35,500
I'm a healer, for God's sake.

91
00:04:35,501 --> 00:04:36,861
Oh, for crying out loud!

92
00:04:36,862 --> 00:04:39,137
Dad, I have every right to feel upset about this...

93
00:04:39,138 --> 00:04:42,991
I will not enjoy my dinner until 
this is where it belongs - in the trash.

94
00:04:42,992 --> 00:04:45,234
Oh, oh, there was an article in there I wanted to save.

95
00:04:45,235 --> 00:04:48,323
- On what?
- Nothing.

96
00:04:48,324 --> 00:04:50,254
- Come on, I'm interested.
- Oh, let's drop it.

97
00:04:50,255 --> 00:04:51,489
Why can't you tell me?

98
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:56,330
All right, it was all about Margaret Thatcher's secret 
for growing prize-winning zinnias. Are you happy?

99
00:04:58,576 --> 00:04:59,653
Not really.

100
00:05:05,299 --> 00:05:10,494
All right, Lorraine. Now, calm down and try and listen to 
what I'm going to say to you. Will you do that?

101
00:05:10,495 --> 00:05:11,601
Okay.

102
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:13,930
All right, good girl. Now your problem...

103
00:05:14,425 --> 00:05:18,371
Oh my gosh, another call waiting - someone else 
trying to get through.

104
00:05:18,372 --> 00:05:19,850
Do you mind if I take It?

105
00:05:20,026 --> 00:05:21,081
No, no. Go right ahead.

106
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:26,432
Well, certainly a very interesting situation 
she's got herself into. 

107
00:05:26,433 --> 00:05:27,372
Don't you think so, Roz?

108
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:32,858
- Yes.

109
00:05:34,171 --> 00:05:36,114
- Okay, I'm back.

110
00:05:36,115 --> 00:05:41,028
All right, Lorraine. Now listen very carefully to what 
I'm going to tell you. Your problem seems...

111
00:05:41,029 --> 00:05:43,852
Oh, I'm sorry. I'll be right back.

112
00:05:46,678 --> 00:05:49,937
For someone who's got so many problems she certainly is popular.

113
00:05:52,266 --> 00:05:57,680
Okay, go ahead Dr. Crane. I'm here. Oh, 
I don't believe it - another call.

114
00:05:57,681 --> 00:05:59,113
Hold it there, Lorraine.

115
00:06:00,202 --> 00:06:04,812
The reason why you want to take that other call 
is the same reason that you want to change career 
and break up with your boyfriend.

116
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:07,466
You're obsessed with what you think you're missing.

117
00:06:07,938 --> 00:06:10,860
The better offer, the call on the other line.

118
00:06:11,359 --> 00:06:14,445
Well, you've got to take one call at a time from now on.

119
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:20,436
Fully explore and experience each one in its turn 
and you'll be a stronger person for it.

120
00:06:21,004 --> 00:06:21,978
Do you follow me, Lorraine?

121
00:06:21,979 --> 00:06:24,960
Okay, I'm back!

122
00:06:31,505 --> 00:06:33,224
Thank you for your call.

123
00:06:35,886 --> 00:06:40,941
Well, we've only got two minutes left, 
so I would like to end today's program on a personal note.

124
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:47,380
As some of you may know, yesterday I was mentioned 
in Derek Mann's "Mann About Town" column.

125
00:06:47,381 --> 00:06:58,372
He said, and I quote, "I Hate Frasier Crane"... 
"I Hate Frasier Crane".

126
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:02,609
What trenchant criticism.

127
00:07:03,734 --> 00:07:09,194
Move aside Voltaire, step back in the shadows H.L. Mencken, 
there's a new kid in town.

128
00:07:11,847 --> 00:07:17,578
One can only wonder how many hours Derek Mann sat 
in the glow of his computer screen before...

129
00:07:17,579 --> 00:07:27,032
...before his trembling fingers sprang to life 
and pecked out this chef t'ouerve: "I Hate Frasier Crane."

130
00:07:27,939 --> 00:07:36,802
A lesser critic would have wasted our time 
by presenting a well thought-out, point by point, 
constructive critique of this show.

131
00:07:36,803 --> 00:07:39,154
No, not our Mr. Mann.

132
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:47,987
So dear listeners, when Mr. Mann's column arrives on your doorstep - 
read it, enjoy it, but above all, treasure it.

133
00:07:47,988 --> 00:07:53,201
For one day this man will be joining the Pantheon of the immortals.

134
00:07:53,605 --> 00:07:54,795
And if we're lucky...

135
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,424
it'll be one day soon.

136
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,122
I'm Dr. Frasier Crane.

137
00:08:09,518 --> 00:08:11,728
Frasier, how funny running into you here.

138
00:08:11,729 --> 00:08:12,788
I'm always here.

139
00:08:12,789 --> 00:08:15,065
Yes well, you weren't here twenty minutes ago: 
have you seen today's "Times"?

140
00:08:15,824 --> 00:08:16,885
No.

141
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,387
Lucky for you I saved you this copy. 
Take a look at Derek Mann's column.

142
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:25,029
You know, this is the second time in as many days 
that you have given me a paper.

143
00:08:25,675 --> 00:08:27,809
Have you ever considered getting yourself a route?

144
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,747
Hello, I don't believe we've met.

145
00:08:32,171 --> 00:08:35,354
Yes, we have, Niles, three or four times. Roz Doyle.

146
00:08:35,689 --> 00:08:40,038
Oh, of course. It was at the... it was during the...

147
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:44,560
well, I'm far too successful to feel awkward. 
Where did we meet?

148
00:08:47,214 --> 00:08:48,805
The radio station.

149
00:08:48,806 --> 00:08:51,188
Ah, I'll take your word for it. Nice to see you again.

150
00:08:51,629 --> 00:08:54,440
Aparently Mr. Mann heard your program yesterday.

151
00:08:54,441 --> 00:08:55,331
So I see.

152
00:08:55,830 --> 00:09:02,478
"Yesterday afternoon, Dr. Frasier Crane got on my case 
for not given him a point by point criticism of his radio show.

153
00:09:02,479 --> 00:09:05,216
Well, he asked for it, so here goes."

154
00:09:05,217 --> 00:09:08,338
Oh my god, his entire column is about your show.

155
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:09,575
Not very flattering either.

156
00:09:09,576 --> 00:09:13,161
Towards the end he even attacks your 
"dimwitted sidekick call screener."

157
00:09:13,433 --> 00:09:14,370
That's me!

158
00:09:15,247 --> 00:09:16,909
Oh, now I remember you!

159
00:09:20,649 --> 00:09:23,257
"It's hard to say what I hate most about Crane's show...

160
00:09:23,258 --> 00:09:30,482
his pompous, sanctimonious style, his constant self-congratulatory 
references to his own life, or his voice:

161
00:09:30,704 --> 00:09:39,396
 a mock-sympathetic tone so sickly sweet one wonders 
if the man graduated from medical school or from some mind-controlling cult."

162
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:41,216
It's continued on twelve.

163
00:09:41,217 --> 00:09:42,406
I've read enough!

164
00:09:44,031 --> 00:09:45,243
Can I get you folks anything?

165
00:09:45,244 --> 00:09:46,821
How can the man thing something like that?

166
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:48,756
It's my job, I'm a waiter.

167
00:09:50,712 --> 00:09:52,162
We don't want anything, thank you.

168
00:09:52,783 --> 00:09:56,368
Listen Frasier, I know this stinks, 
but in a couple of days it'll blow over.

169
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:57,982
Oh, perhaps you're right.

170
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:02,829
As angry as it makes me, to retaliate would be to stoop to his level.

171
00:10:03,361 --> 00:10:05,358
So the best response is no response at all.

172
00:10:06,404 --> 00:10:08,882
"Pompous and sanctimonious," am I?

173
00:10:09,798 --> 00:10:12,757
Well, this Mann character can't even write 
grammatical sentences!

174
00:10:12,758 --> 00:10:16,313
Every five words there's another one of his precious "dot, dot, dots."

175
00:10:16,314 --> 00:10:21,051
Must be because he likes making all those dots 
with the crayon he writes this drivel with!

176
00:10:23,397 --> 00:10:28,721
Dr. Crane, on line two we have Stewart who's 
having a problem with delayed gratification.

177
00:10:28,722 --> 00:10:29,953
Well, he's just going to have to wait!

178
00:10:32,152 --> 00:10:40,275
I don't know who this Derek Mann think he is, 
but if he thinks he can hide behind his newspaper like 
some sniveling schoolchild cowering behind a tree,

179
00:10:40,276 --> 00:10:45,715
then I say let's expose this Derek Mann for what he is: 
not a man at all, but half a man!

180
00:10:46,446 --> 00:10:48,168
Now what line did you say Stewart was on?

181
00:10:48,671 --> 00:10:49,423
He hang up.

182
00:10:49,424 --> 00:10:51,937
Well, I'm leaving all sorts of bodies in my wake today.

183
00:10:53,179 --> 00:10:54,996
Let's see who's on line five.

184
00:10:55,368 --> 00:10:59,482
Hello, this is Dr. Frasier Crane - I'm listening.

185
00:10:59,483 --> 00:11:01,963
Good, because I was listening too.

186
00:11:01,964 --> 00:11:02,973
And you are?

187
00:11:02,974 --> 00:11:04,598
Derek Mann.

188
00:11:05,253 --> 00:11:06,525
I see.

189
00:11:08,356 --> 00:11:12,931
Look, nobody calls me half a man - 
especially some Ivy League Twit.

190
00:11:12,932 --> 00:11:16,153
So what do you say we settle this like men?

191
00:11:17,033 --> 00:11:19,066
Are you implying that you want to fight me?

192
00:11:19,067 --> 00:11:21,470
I'm not implying it, I'm saying it.

193
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:23,558
Fight, as in a fist fight?

194
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:26,497
No, I thought we might throw pies at each other!

195
00:11:27,496 --> 00:11:30,986
So are you up to it, or aren't you man enough?

196
00:11:38,017 --> 00:11:40,077
We'll be right back after these messages.

197
00:11:43,353 --> 00:11:44,591
And we're back.

198
00:11:44,609 --> 00:11:48,709
Well, we have a suprise caller on the line: Derek Mann.

199
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:51,760
So what's it going to be, Crane, 
are you going to fight me or not?

200
00:11:51,761 --> 00:11:53,207
Oh, you can't be serious.

201
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:55,917
Just like I figured, you're a chicken.

202
00:11:55,918 --> 00:11:58,647
No, I just don't think that civilized 
people behave that way.

203
00:11:58,648 --> 00:12:01,694
You know, Roz, perhaps our listeners 
have an opinion about that subject?

204
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,216
Who do we have on the line?

205
00:12:03,217 --> 00:12:06,136
Well, lines one through eight are people 
who think you're chicken.

206
00:12:08,013 --> 00:12:10,264
You're chicken, Crane. Admit it!

207
00:12:10,265 --> 00:12:11,655
I am not chicken!

208
00:12:12,738 --> 00:12:15,435
We are mature thinking people, not cavemen!

209
00:12:16,771 --> 00:12:19,359
Alright, if you want a fight so bad, 
I'll give you a fight!

210
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,145
You just name the time and place!

211
00:12:21,146 --> 00:12:27,915
Kinsley square, right outside your office, 
by the old statue. Noon tomorrow. Don't back out!

212
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:29,212
I won't!

213
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:38,056
Don't you back out either because I know where your office is too, 
and I know where you live, and I'll track you down!

214
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:43,172
Now who else out there wants a piece of me?!

215
00:12:46,111 --> 00:12:48,322
Having a look at that old murder case again?

216
00:12:48,323 --> 00:12:50,770
Yeah, I've dug out the old crime scene photos.

217
00:12:50,771 --> 00:12:53,477
Well, don't be a greedy guts - let's have a look.

218
00:13:03,217 --> 00:13:04,392
Her name was Helen.

219
00:13:05,503 --> 00:13:06,672
Yeah, it was.

220
00:13:07,944 --> 00:13:10,689
Ah, you must have seen it on some of the papers 
I've had lying around here.

221
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:13,801
No, I just got this feeling when I touched the picture.

222
00:13:13,802 --> 00:13:15,270
You're putting me on.

223
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,783
She had a lot of men in her life.

224
00:13:17,784 --> 00:13:19,715
No kidding: she was a hooker!

225
00:13:21,181 --> 00:13:24,338
No, I mean she had four brothers.

226
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:27,101
That's amazing.

227
00:13:27,102 --> 00:13:30,832
She did have four brothers. What else are you getting?

228
00:13:32,388 --> 00:13:33,785
Well, come on, tell me more.

229
00:13:33,786 --> 00:13:36,439
I can't just turn it on and off like a faucet.

230
00:13:38,806 --> 00:13:40,842
Give it a try, will you? Please.

231
00:13:40,843 --> 00:13:42,264
What else are you getting?

232
00:13:42,265 --> 00:13:43,339
Nothing.

233
00:13:43,783 --> 00:13:46,463
No, wait, I see a man.

234
00:13:46,464 --> 00:13:47,287
Yeah?

235
00:13:47,569 --> 00:13:49,191
A well-dressed man.

236
00:13:49,568 --> 00:13:53,220
- He's wearing wing tips and a trench coat.
- Yeah? Yeah?

237
00:13:53,221 --> 00:13:55,131
He's getting off an elevator...

238
00:13:55,699 --> 00:13:58,321
he's walking down a long hallway...

239
00:13:58,722 --> 00:14:00,186
she doesn't know he's coming...

240
00:14:00,417 --> 00:14:02,473
he's opening the door...

241
00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:03,687
Hello, everyone.

242
00:14:07,808 --> 00:14:10,097
Sometimes I get my signals crossed.

243
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:13,231
What's going on?

244
00:14:13,232 --> 00:14:16,288
Well - unless you killed a hooker when 
you were twelve - nothing much!

245
00:14:18,129 --> 00:14:19,720
We heard your show today.

246
00:14:20,277 --> 00:14:22,723
I just loved the way you handled that Derek Mann.

247
00:14:22,724 --> 00:14:24,747
Ah. You made your old man proud.

248
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:28,706
Yet the best part was when he challenged you 
to a fight and you stood right up to him.

249
00:14:29,246 --> 00:14:30,692
Yes I did, didn't I?

250
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:34,109
Boy, I can't wait to see that.

251
00:14:34,658 --> 00:14:37,642
Well, I'm not actually going to go through with it, dad.

252
00:14:38,001 --> 00:14:39,217
What are you talking about?

253
00:14:39,724 --> 00:14:41,879
Well, I already won our little war of words.

254
00:14:43,209 --> 00:14:46,529
What would I stand to benefit by actually 
going through with a fist fight?

255
00:14:46,954 --> 00:14:49,732
Frasier, maybe I'm misunderstanding something here...

256
00:14:50,221 --> 00:14:52,999
he challenged you and you're backing down?

257
00:14:53,866 --> 00:14:58,382
Well, mature people are supposed to use their 
intellect to settle their differences.

258
00:14:58,383 --> 00:15:01,574
A man doesn't just turn his tail and run - 
that's not the way I brought you up.

259
00:15:01,575 --> 00:15:03,211
Are you encouraging me to fight?

260
00:15:03,212 --> 00:15:05,401
Damn right I am - you gave the guy your word.

261
00:15:05,402 --> 00:15:08,175
Yes, but I didn't even know what I was saying - 
I hadn't even had lunch yet.

262
00:15:10,556 --> 00:15:12,103
I might have known this would have happened.

263
00:15:12,104 --> 00:15:14,278
It's Billy Kreizel all over again.

264
00:15:15,319 --> 00:15:16,350
What did you say?

265
00:15:16,351 --> 00:15:18,589
Something about Billy Kreizel, I believe.

266
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:21,697
I can't believe you're dragging that up - 
that was thirty years ago.

267
00:15:21,698 --> 00:15:23,062
Who's this Billy Kreizel?

268
00:15:23,063 --> 00:15:25,301
Oh, he was this kid in fifth grade that used to torment me!

269
00:15:25,302 --> 00:15:27,874
So one day Frasier made fun of Billy's crewcut.

270
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:30,438
Well, he started it by making fun of the 
elbow patches on my blazer!

271
00:15:35,194 --> 00:15:37,915
Well, the point is, they were supposed to meet 
for a fight after school.

272
00:15:37,916 --> 00:15:39,882
Only "Patches" here didn't show up!

273
00:15:40,214 --> 00:15:42,139
I had a clarinet lesson!

274
00:15:43,814 --> 00:15:45,212
You don't need to remind me of that!

275
00:15:45,213 --> 00:15:47,037
Billy's old man was a cop, too.

276
00:15:47,038 --> 00:15:50,036
Boy, the guys rode me about that excuse of yours for years.

277
00:15:50,037 --> 00:15:51,952
Every time I couldn't make it out for a drink they say,

278
00:15:51,953 --> 00:15:53,820
"What's the matter? You got a clarinet lesson?"

279
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:58,135
Couldn't you met Billy after the clarinet lesson?

280
00:15:58,649 --> 00:16:00,346
Daphne, would you please excuse us for a moment!

281
00:16:01,898 --> 00:16:03,102
Of course.

282
00:16:03,626 --> 00:16:06,832
I have a feeling I'm going to be 
excused quite a lot in the house.

283
00:16:09,788 --> 00:16:16,012
Dad, I am sorry if I embarrassed you for not 
fighting Billy Kreizel thirty years ago.

284
00:16:16,013 --> 00:16:17,810
But the situation is not the same now.

285
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:19,015
It's exactly the same.

286
00:16:19,016 --> 00:16:22,414
I am an adult now, I've been to medical school, 
I hold a certain position in this city...

287
00:16:22,415 --> 00:16:24,553
I do not settle my differences with brawling.

288
00:16:24,821 --> 00:16:26,727
The man challenged you, you accepted.

289
00:16:26,728 --> 00:16:27,915
Dad, I can't believe this.

290
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:29,537
You won't be happy until I come home with a black eye.

291
00:16:29,538 --> 00:16:31,468
I just want you to do what you said you were going to do.

292
00:16:32,646 --> 00:16:39,807
You know, you can talk about your medical school, 
your intellect, your place in the city, but you know what?

293
00:16:40,528 --> 00:16:42,916
It's all one big clarinet lesson...

294
00:16:45,111 --> 00:16:46,728
I can't even look at you.

295
00:16:58,121 --> 00:17:04,580
So, I step out of the shower, I look out the window 
and I notice the garbage man looking right in at me.

296
00:17:04,913 --> 00:17:06,693
So I say, "Did you get a good look?"

297
00:17:06,694 --> 00:17:09,170
And he says, "Not completely, turn around."

298
00:17:10,639 --> 00:17:15,434
The he smiled, and he's missing a tooth, 
and that's when the romance went right out of it for me.

299
00:17:17,325 --> 00:17:19,813
Roz, why are you telling me this story?

300
00:17:19,814 --> 00:17:25,422
I'm trying to get your mind of the fact that in five minutes 
you're going to walk out that square and get your clock cleaned.

301
00:17:26,066 --> 00:17:29,423
Well, did it ever occurred to you that 
I might actually win this fight?

302
00:17:29,424 --> 00:17:30,595
Your shoe's untied.

303
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:34,942
If you fell for that one, you're going down 
and you're going down hard.

304
00:17:37,711 --> 00:17:40,314
Frasier, there's quite a crowd forming out there.

305
00:17:40,315 --> 00:17:43,775
Secretaries with bag lunches, business men, 
children with balloons...

306
00:17:43,984 --> 00:17:46,082
All that's missing is a mariachi band.

307
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:47,083
They're setting up.

308
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:51,187
Well, I better go find a great place in the crowd.

309
00:17:52,118 --> 00:17:56,369
I'll be off to the left, Frasier, if you tear 
his ear off and want to throw it to a beautiful señorita.

310
00:17:58,306 --> 00:18:02,869
Frasier, as your brother and as your friend - 
why are you doing this?

311
00:18:05,562 --> 00:18:07,587
- It's Billy Kreizel.
- Where?

312
00:18:13,423 --> 00:18:15,244
He's not here, Niles.

313
00:18:15,684 --> 00:18:19,472
It's just that I ran away from him when I was ten.

314
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:20,439
I remember.

315
00:18:21,348 --> 00:18:24,521
You know, and I've been running ever since.

316
00:18:25,882 --> 00:18:29,857
Well, this is where it stops. 
I'm not running anymore.

317
00:18:30,449 --> 00:18:32,942
What is it that makes us Crane boys such targets?

318
00:18:39,078 --> 00:18:41,701
Chalk it up to randon violence!

319
00:18:45,702 --> 00:18:46,809
Hey, there.

320
00:18:48,209 --> 00:18:50,167
Dad? What are you doing here?

321
00:18:50,168 --> 00:18:54,641
Look son, I said a couple of things 
last night that maybe went over the line.

322
00:18:54,642 --> 00:18:59,043
Look dad, if you were worried that you talked me 
into something that I wasn't ready to do...

323
00:18:59,044 --> 00:19:03,671
you're, you're wrong. You can relax. 
I doing this for myself.

324
00:19:03,672 --> 00:19:04,764
Good.

325
00:19:06,071 --> 00:19:08,842
So. Who told you that I was going through with it, anyway?

326
00:19:08,843 --> 00:19:11,960
Oh, let's just say a father knows certain things about his son.

327
00:19:14,517 --> 00:19:17,546
Good news, I parked in front of a broken meter.

328
00:19:17,547 --> 00:19:18,529
We're getting a freebie.

329
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:22,078
Well, good luck, Dr. Crane, with the fight.

330
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:23,416
Thank you, Daphne.

331
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:26,286
Any psychic predictions on the outcome?

332
00:19:26,287 --> 00:19:29,736
Actually, yes. But don't worry. I'm frequently wrong.

333
00:19:33,569 --> 00:19:35,873
Frasier, Frasier, come here, 
there's something I want you to see.

334
00:19:37,137 --> 00:19:40,587
There, the man standing to the left of the statue...

335
00:19:40,588 --> 00:19:43,559
I recognize his picture from the newspaper, 
that's Derek Mann.

336
00:19:44,617 --> 00:19:45,925
He's gigantic!

337
00:19:47,325 --> 00:19:50,297
My God, you could show a movie on his back.

338
00:19:52,546 --> 00:19:54,416
You sure you want to go through with this?

339
00:19:55,274 --> 00:19:57,838
- Yes, yes I am.
- Good.

340
00:19:57,839 --> 00:19:58,997
Now, you'll be fine.

341
00:19:58,998 --> 00:20:01,717
Just remember this is a street fight 
and not a boxing match.

342
00:20:01,718 --> 00:20:04,053
So fight dirty and throw the first punch!

343
00:20:04,139 --> 00:20:07,549
I found that a swift knee to the groin 
usually does the trick.

344
00:20:08,028 --> 00:20:12,052
If you have any doubts, check with the fellow 
in Manchester named Nigel Tavers.

345
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,681
Well, if we want an unobstructed view...

346
00:20:15,682 --> 00:20:19,025
Look, I prefer if you guys stay here. 
You'll only make me nervous.

347
00:20:19,026 --> 00:20:20,064
Whatever you want.

348
00:20:24,508 --> 00:20:28,625
- Well, wish me luck.
- Go

349
00:20:33,146 --> 00:20:35,016
They've got a mariachi band out there!

350
00:20:35,017 --> 00:20:38,071
Yes. I have to get their card, 
I need someone for our summer barbaque.

351
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:41,828
Oh look, they're starting to fight.

352
00:20:41,829 --> 00:20:44,045
Nah, they're just circling, sizing each other up.

353
00:20:44,204 --> 00:20:45,046
Come on, Frasier. If you're gonna have it, 
get him first.

354
00:20:49,042 --> 00:20:51,472
- Is that the police?
- Yeah, what are they doing here?

355
00:20:51,473 --> 00:20:53,991
They're breaking it up! Just when they were getting started.

356
00:20:58,543 --> 00:21:01,900
Alright, alright, I'm coming along peacefully - 
just let me get my jacket.

357
00:21:01,901 --> 00:21:03,791
Relax, I'm not arresting you.

358
00:21:03,792 --> 00:21:07,622
But I'm warning you that in this town 
we don't settle our differences with street fights...

359
00:21:07,623 --> 00:21:08,749
no matter who you are.

360
00:21:09,576 --> 00:21:12,285
Well thank you, officer, you'll have no more trouble from me.

361
00:21:12,286 --> 00:21:13,410
Okay.

362
00:21:15,131 --> 00:21:17,152
Dad, dad, did you see me?

363
00:21:17,153 --> 00:21:19,782
Look at me. Look. My hands are trembling, 
my chest is pounding,

364
00:21:19,783 --> 00:21:22,822
my mouth is all dry, my knees are like jello... 
God, I feel great!

365
00:21:24,348 --> 00:21:25,374
You did good.

366
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:29,504
Yeah. I was out there. I was raring to go, you saw that... 
right? I was ready.

367
00:21:29,505 --> 00:21:31,449
I know you were. You would have kicked his but!

368
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:32,679
From here to Tacoma.

369
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:36,922
I say we celebrate! Everyone, a round of victory lattes on me.

370
00:21:43,157 --> 00:21:44,429
Thanks Harry, I owe you one.

371
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:45,443
No problem, Marty.

372
00:21:45,444 --> 00:21:46,777
You cut it pretty close, though.

373
00:21:46,778 --> 00:21:48,300
Another minutes and Frasier would have been in sidewalk.

374
00:21:48,301 --> 00:21:50,589
Give me a break, I missing my lunch for this.

375
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:52,898
You can stand without a few lunches.

376
00:21:52,899 --> 00:21:56,916
Say, some of the guys are getting together later 
down at Duke's for a bear. Why don't you come along?

377
00:21:56,917 --> 00:21:59,302
Yeah, maybe I will. And you know why I will?

378
00:21:59,831 --> 00:22:02,831
'Cause the Crane boys don't take clarinet lessons anymore.

379
00:22:03,309 --> 00:22:04,991
What the hell are you talking about?

380
00:22:05,641 --> 00:22:08,205
Oh that's right, you weren't in my precinct.
