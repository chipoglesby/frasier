1
00:00:09,801 --> 00:00:11,951
Listen to yourself, Bob.

2
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:16,338
You follow her to work. You eavesdrop
on her calls. You open her mail.

3
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:20,119
When you started doing these things,
the relationship was over.

4
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:23,315
Thank you for your call.

5
00:00:23,606 --> 00:00:25,881
Roz, we have time for one more.

6
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:29,587
Yes. On line four,
we have Russell from Kirkland.

7
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:34,300
Hello, Russell, this is Dr Frasier Crane.
I'm listening.

8
00:00:34,617 --> 00:00:39,532
'I've been feeling sort of,
you know, depressed lately.

9
00:00:39,914 --> 00:00:43,384
'My life's not going anywhere.
It's not that bad.

10
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:48,261
'It's just, same old apartment,
same old job. Sometimes...'

11
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:50,587
We're at the end of our hour.

12
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:54,517
I'll cut to the chase
by using myself as an example.

13
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:58,441
Six months ago, I was living in Boston.

14
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:02,203
My wife had left me, which was
very painful.

15
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,479
Then she came back to me,
which was excruciating.

16
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:14,275
On top of that,
my practice had grown stagnant

17
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:19,565
and my social life consisted
of hanging around a bar every night.

18
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:23,909
I was clinging to a life
that wasn't working.

19
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:26,598
I knew I had to do something, anything.

20
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:31,668
So I ended the marriage and moved
back here to my hometown of Seattle.

21
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:34,200
Go, Seahawks!

22
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:37,381
I took action, Russell, and you can too.

23
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:42,311
Move, change, do something.
If it's a mistake, do something else.

24
00:01:42,686 --> 00:01:44,995
Will you do that, Russell?

25
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:47,686
Will you?

26
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:50,409
Russell? I think we lost him.

27
00:01:50,694 --> 00:01:53,413
No, we cut to the news
30 seconds ago.

28
00:01:56,991 --> 00:01:59,186
Oh, for crying out loud!

29
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:01,408
I bare my soul to Seattle.

30
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:04,939
They're listening to
Chopper Dave's Rush Hour Roundup!

31
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:11,386
The rest of the show was pretty good.
It was a good show, wasn't it?

32
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:13,712
Your brother called.

33
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:17,926
We call that "avoidance". Don't change
the subject. Tell me what you think.

34
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:20,697
Did I ever tell you
what this button does?

35
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,930
I am not a piece of Lalique.

36
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:26,654
I can handle criticism.
How was I today?

37
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:31,292
You dropped two commercials,
left a total of 28 seconds of dead air,

38
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:34,563
scrambled the call letters,
spilt yoghurt on the control board,

39
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:38,617
and you kept referring to Jerry,
with the identity crisis, as "Jeff".

40
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,936
You say my brother called?

41
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:55,573
So I said to the gardener,
"Yoshi, I do not want a Zen garden.

42
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:58,883
"lf I want to rake gravel
every ten minutes for inner harmony,

43
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,329
"I'll move to Yokohama."

44
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:05,477
This offends him, so he starts
pulling up Maris' prized camellias.

45
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,846
I couldn't stand for that.

46
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:12,256
I marched inside and locked the door
until he cooled down.

47
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,897
Would you have handled it differently?

48
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:20,348
Sorry, Niles.
I didn't realise you'd stopped talking.

49
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:22,535
You haven't heard a word!

50
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:24,742
You're a shrink. You know how it is

51
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:27,590
when people go on
about their mundane lives.

52
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:32,106
TouchÃ©. And on that subject,
I heard your show today.

53
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:40,735
- And?
- You know my view of pop psychiatry.

54
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:45,642
And everything. When was the last
time you had an unexpressed thought?

55
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:48,485
I'm having one now.

56
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:53,028
- You guys ready?
- Two cafelatte supremos.

57
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:02,988
No, thank you.

58
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:07,888
So, Frasier,
how are you doing on your own?

59
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:11,039
I'm fine. I love my new life.

60
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:15,122
I love the solitude.
I miss Frederick, of course.

61
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:21,413
He's playing goalie on the pee-wee
soccer team. Chip off the old block.

62
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:24,678
- You hated sports.
- So does he!

63
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:29,356
The fresh air's good for him.

64
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:31,760
Well, this has been fun.

65
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:36,698
- There's a problem we should discuss.
- Is it Dad?

66
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:39,502
One of his old police buddies called.

67
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:43,294
He went to see him
and found him on the bathroom floor.

68
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:45,686
- Oh, my God!
- He's fine.

69
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:50,867
- Is it his hip again?
- I don't think he can live alone now.

70
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:53,558
What can we do?

71
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:57,145
This won't be anyone's
favourite solution,

72
00:04:57,464 --> 00:05:01,457
but I took the liberty of checking out
a few convalescent homes for him.

73
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:04,076
A home? He's still a young man.

74
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:08,624
You can't take care of him.
You're getting your new life together.

75
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:11,364
<i>We were never simpatico.</i>

76
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:13,874
Of course, I can't take care of him.

77
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:17,583
Oh, yes, of course. Why?

78
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:20,813
- Dad doesn't get along with Maris.
- Who does?

79
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:23,751
I thought you liked my Maris.

80
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:27,388
I do. I like her from a distance.

81
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:31,217
You know, the way you like the sun.
Maris is like the sun,

82
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:33,848
except without the warmth.

83
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:41,379
Well, then, we're agreed
about what to do with Dad.

84
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:45,629
"Golden Acres.
We care so you don't have to."

85
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:54,142
- It says that?
- It might as well.

86
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:58,297
OK, I'll make up the spare bedroom.

87
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:02,923
- You're a good son, Frasier.
- Oh, God, I am, aren't l?

88
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:05,509
Two cafe supremos. Anything to eat?

89
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:08,580
No, I seem to have lost my appetite.

90
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,938
I'll have a large piece of cheesecake.

91
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:23,148
(He plays passionately)

92
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:25,422
(Doorbell)

93
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:48,719
- Hi!
- We finally made it.

94
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:51,468
Dad, welcome to your new home.

95
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:54,543
Gee, you look great.

96
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:57,299
Don't BS me.
I do not look great.

97
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:59,540
I spent Monday on the bathroom floor.

98
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:02,467
You can still see
the tile marks on my face.

99
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:06,946
Gives you some idea
about the ride over here.

100
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,534
Here we are.

101
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:15,857
Rest assured. The refrigerator
is stocked with your favourite beer.

102
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:20,186
We've got hot links and coleslaw
and I rented a Charles Bronson movie.

103
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:23,356
Cut the speech.
We all know why I'm here.

104
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:28,281
I can't be alone without falling
on my ass and you're stuck with me.

105
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:32,172
No, no!

106
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:36,039
We have a chance to get reacquainted.

107
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:39,243
That implies we were acquainted
at one point.

108
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:48,760
Why don't I take Dad's things
into his new bachelor quarters

109
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:52,052
so you scoundrels
can plan some high jinks?

110
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:56,362
That wife of his is driving him nutso.

111
00:07:56,643 --> 00:08:01,319
Yes, we Crane boys
sure know how to marry.

112
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:07,506
Let me get you a beer, Dad.

113
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:11,135
What do you think
of what I've done with the place?

114
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:16,569
Every item was carefully selected.
This lamp by Corbu, chair by Eames.

115
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:21,824
This couch is a replica of the one
Coco Chanel had in her Paris atelier.

116
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:26,203
- Nothing matches.
- It's a style of decorating. It's eclectic.

117
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:31,322
If you've got
really fine pieces of furniture,

118
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:35,072
it doesn't matter if they match.
They will go together.

119
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,620
It's your money.

120
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:40,869
(Doorbell)

121
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:43,823
Hey, that's the Space Needle there.

122
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:48,498
Thanks for pointing that out. Being born
and raised here, I never woulda known.

123
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:54,239
- Delivery for Martin Crane.
- In here.

124
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,843
Excuse me! Wait a minute!

125
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,350
- Where do you want it?
- Where's the TV?

126
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:01,977
- In that credenza.
- Point it at that.

127
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:05,287
- What about this chair?
- I'll move it.

128
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:08,260
Careful! That's a Wassily!

129
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:11,980
Dad, I'm sure this piece is dear to you,

130
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,854
but I don't think
it goes with anything here.

131
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:17,857
I know. It's eclectic.

132
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:22,999
Niles, will you help me out here?

133
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:26,866
I need an extension cord
to plug in the vibrating part.

134
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:30,309
Yes, that will be the crowning touch.

135
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,232
Now you're settled in, I've got to run.

136
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:40,008
I'm late for my
dysfunctional family seminar.

137
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:43,766
Dad, have you mentioned Eddie yet?

138
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:45,873
- Eddie?
- Ta-ta.

139
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:50,564
- No, not Eddie!
- He's my best friend. Get me my beer.

140
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:55,918
He's weird. He gives me the creeps.
All he does is stare at me.

141
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:58,382
It's your imagination.

142
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,918
No, I'm sorry. I'm putting my foot down.
Eddie is not moving in here.

143
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:08,499
(Suspense music on TV)

144
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:13,538
(Screams and a gunshot)

145
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:27,294
Niles, sorry I'm late.

146
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:32,534
As I was leaving, Dad decided to cook
lunch by the glow of a small kitchen fire.

147
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:36,121
This last week with Dad,
it's been a living hell.

148
00:10:36,428 --> 00:10:40,501
Either my territory's being violated
or I worry about what he's up to.

149
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:45,639
I'm a nervous wreck. I must calm down.
Double espresso, please.

150
00:10:46,021 --> 00:10:50,617
You don't still have the brochures
from those...those rest homes, do you?

151
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:55,421
Of course I do. Don't forget,
Maris is five years older than I am.

152
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:01,047
You really think that's necessary?

153
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:04,364
Yes. I don't have my life any more.

154
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,815
I gave up my tickets to the theatre,
to the symphony....

155
00:11:08,126 --> 00:11:09,798
What about the opera?

156
00:11:10,045 --> 00:11:12,843
- Here.
- Thank you.

157
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:19,840
You don't suppose there's a chance
that you and Maris could..?

158
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:25,818
Maris and I were discussing this. We
should share the responsibility more.

159
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:31,142
- You mean you'd take him in?
- Dear God, no!

160
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:34,482
We'll help you pay
for a home care worker.

161
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:38,612
Someone to cook, clean and
help Dad with his physical therapy.

162
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:41,542
These angels exist?

163
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:45,182
I know an agency.
I'll ask them to send a few people over.

164
00:11:46,665 --> 00:11:52,137
Niles, I can't thank you enough.
I feel this urge to hug you.

165
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:56,424
Remember what Mom always said.
"A handshake is as good as a hug."

166
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:00,591
Wise woman.

167
00:12:02,097 --> 00:12:06,056
I have never been more impressed
with a human being in my life.

168
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:11,997
- What was wrong with that one?
- She was casing the joint.

169
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:16,145
Casing the joint! She spent
two years with Mother Teresa.

170
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:20,365
If I were Mother Teresa,
I'd check my jewellery box.

171
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:24,411
(Doorbell)

172
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:28,256
This is the last one.
Try to keep an open mind.

173
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:33,336
(English accent) Hello.
Caught with me hand in the biscuit tin!

174
00:12:33,712 --> 00:12:37,864
- I'm Daphne. Daphne Moon.
- Frasier Crane. Please come in.

175
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:42,209
My father, Martin Crane.
Dad, this is Daphne Moon.

176
00:12:42,554 --> 00:12:45,944
Nice to meet you.
Oh, and who might this be?

177
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:48,826
That is Eddie.

178
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:55,636
- I call him Eddie Spaghetti.
- He likes pasta?

179
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:57,898
No, he has worms.

180
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:07,689
- Have a seat, Miss Moon.
- Daphne. Thank you.

181
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:14,052
Will you look at that?
What a comfy chair. I always say,

182
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:17,976
"Start with a good piece, and
replace the rest when you can afford it."

183
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:29,965
Perhaps you should start
by telling us about yourself.

184
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:34,508
- I'm from Manchester, England.
- Really? Did you hear that, Dad?

185
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:38,849
I'm three feet away.
There's nothing wrong with my hearing.

186
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:44,066
I've only been in the US
for a few months,

187
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:49,401
but I have an extensive background
in home care and physical therapy,

188
00:13:49,788 --> 00:13:52,780
as you can see from my rÃ©sumÃ©.

189
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:55,199
You were a policeman, weren't you?

190
00:13:55,460 --> 00:14:01,137
- Yeah. How'd you know?
- I must confess I'm a bit psychic.

191
00:14:03,218 --> 00:14:07,257
It's nothing big.
Just little things I sense about people.

192
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:09,713
It's not like I could pick the lottery.

193
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:14,206
If I could, I wouldn't be talking
to the likes of you two now, would l?

194
00:14:15,105 --> 00:14:18,780
Yes.
Perhaps I should describe your duties.

195
00:14:19,109 --> 00:14:23,864
Wait. I'm getting something on you.
You're a florist.

196
00:14:27,117 --> 00:14:32,145
- No, I'm a psychiatrist.
- Well, it comes and goes.

197
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:36,578
Usually it's strongest
during my time of the month.

198
00:14:36,918 --> 00:14:40,149
I guess I let a little secret out there.

199
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:42,499
It's safe with us.

200
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:49,158
We've learned all we need to know
about you. And a dash extra.

201
00:14:51,516 --> 00:14:53,472
You're a dog, aren't you?

202
00:14:58,523 --> 00:15:00,878
Well, we'll be calling you, Miss Moon.

203
00:15:01,151 --> 00:15:03,790
- You got the job.
- Wonderful!

204
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:09,303
Aren't you forgetting something?
Shouldn't we talk about this in private?

205
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:14,536
Of course. I completely understand.
I'll just pop into the loo.

206
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,303
- You do have one, don't you?
- Yes.

207
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:20,337
Oh, I love America.

208
00:15:22,797 --> 00:15:25,834
- Dad!
- You wanted me to pick one.

209
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:31,208
- She's a kook. I don't like her.
- She'll only be here when you're not.

210
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:34,112
Then what's my problem?

211
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:36,872
Daphne!

212
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:41,654
- You've been retained.
- Oh, wonderful! I had a premonition.

213
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:44,061
Quelle surprise.

214
00:15:44,319 --> 00:15:47,197
I'll move my things in tomorrow.

215
00:15:47,489 --> 00:15:51,846
There must be some misunderstanding.
This isn't a live-in position.

216
00:15:52,202 --> 00:15:54,318
The lady at the agency...

217
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:58,811
She was wrong. This is
a part-time position. It won't work out.

218
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:02,796
- Let's talk about this.
- There's nothing to discuss.

219
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:06,007
You should talk about this.
I'll just pop back in here

220
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:09,371
and enjoy your African erotic art.

221
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:14,710
- I think it would be best if you leave.
- Oh, all right.

222
00:16:15,058 --> 00:16:20,086
We'll contact you. If not by telephone,
then through the toaster.

223
00:16:27,237 --> 00:16:30,866
- I'm not having her living here.
- Why not?

224
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,236
- There's no room for her!
- What about your study?

225
00:16:34,536 --> 00:16:38,609
That's where I read,
where I do my most profound thinking.

226
00:16:38,957 --> 00:16:42,427
Use the can like the rest of the world.

227
00:16:44,546 --> 00:16:45,501
You'll adjust.

228
00:16:45,714 --> 00:16:50,265
I've done enough adjusting.
I'm in a new city, I've got a new job.

229
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:53,672
I'm separated from my little boy.

230
00:16:53,972 --> 00:16:56,725
And now my father
and his dog are living with me.

231
00:16:57,017 --> 00:17:00,089
The whole idea
of getting somebody in here

232
00:17:00,395 --> 00:17:02,704
was to help ease my burden,
not to add to it.

233
00:17:02,981 --> 00:17:06,940
- Eddie, we're a burden.
- You're twisting my words.

234
00:17:07,277 --> 00:17:10,633
I meant burden
in its most positive sense.

235
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:13,825
As in "Gee, what a lovely burden"?

236
00:17:14,117 --> 00:17:18,156
- Something like that.
- It's not only you who got screwed.

237
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:22,967
Two years ago, some punk
robbing a store put a bullet in my hip.

238
00:17:23,335 --> 00:17:26,133
I traded in my golf clubs
for one of these.

239
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:31,449
I had plans, too. This may be a shock,
but one of them wasn't living with you.

240
00:17:31,843 --> 00:17:35,631
- I'm just trying to be the good son.
- Don't worry.

241
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:40,568
- After I'm gone, you can live guilt-free.
- You think this is about guilt?

242
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:45,607
- Isn't it?
- Of course it is! But I took you in.

243
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:49,452
I wanted to do it
because you're my father!

244
00:17:50,612 --> 00:17:52,728
And how do you repay me?

245
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:56,777
With a snide comment about this
or a smart little putdown about that.

246
00:17:57,118 --> 00:18:00,394
I've done my best to make a home
here for you.

247
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:05,654
Just once would it have killed
you to say one lousy "thank you"?

248
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:18,818
Come on, Eddie,
it's past your dinner time.

249
00:18:19,683 --> 00:18:21,753
I'm going out.

250
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:39,752
They have got to move the bathroom
closer to the studio!

251
00:18:40,078 --> 00:18:44,708
We'll be back after these messages.
Can't I put that on tape?

252
00:18:46,543 --> 00:18:49,421
What's eating you?

253
00:18:49,713 --> 00:18:53,786
Sorry. It's this thing with my father
and this person he wants to hire.

254
00:18:54,134 --> 00:18:57,649
I thought I'd started my life
with a clean slate.

255
00:18:57,971 --> 00:19:02,328
I had a picture of what it was going
to be like and then... I don't know.

256
00:19:02,684 --> 00:19:04,640
Ever heard of Lupe Velez?

257
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:08,773
- Who?
- Lupe Velez. A movie star in the '30s.

258
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:15,614
Her career hit the skids so she decided
to make one final stab at immortality.

259
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:20,380
She figured she'd at least be
remembered for the way she died.

260
00:19:20,744 --> 00:19:23,258
All Lupe wanted
was to be remembered.

261
00:19:23,538 --> 00:19:26,177
So she plans this lavish suicide.

262
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:31,248
Flowers, candles, silk sheet,
white satin gown, full hair and make-up.

263
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:34,985
She takes the overdose of pills,
lays on the bed

264
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:40,328
and imagines how beautiful
she'll look on tomorrow's front page.

265
00:19:40,722 --> 00:19:44,874
Unfortunately, the pills don't set well
with the enchilada combo plate

266
00:19:45,226 --> 00:19:47,456
she sadly chose as her last meal.

267
00:19:49,147 --> 00:19:51,103
She trips in the bathroom,

268
00:19:51,358 --> 00:19:54,395
goes head-first into the toilet.
That's how they found her.

269
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:59,407
Is there a reason
you're telling me this story?

270
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:05,854
Yes. Even if things may not happen like
we planned, they can work out anyway.

271
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:13,703
Remind me of how it worked for Lupe,
last seen with her head in the toilet.

272
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:18,806
All she wanted was to be remembered.
Will you ever forget that story?

273
00:20:23,515 --> 00:20:26,712
We're back. Roz, who's our next caller?

274
00:20:27,018 --> 00:20:31,773
We have Martin on line one.
He's having a problem with his son.

275
00:20:33,692 --> 00:20:37,480
Hello, Martin. This is Dr Frasier Crane.
I'm listening.

276
00:20:37,821 --> 00:20:40,972
(Martin Crane) 'I'm a first-time caller.'

277
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:49,454
Welcome to the show.
How can I help you?

278
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:54,546
'l moved in with my son,
and it ain't working.

279
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:57,355
'There's a lot of tension between us.'

280
00:20:57,632 --> 00:21:01,102
I can imagine.
Why do you think that's so?

281
00:21:01,428 --> 00:21:05,387
'l guess I didn't see he had
a whole new life planned for himself.

282
00:21:05,724 --> 00:21:07,680
'l kind of got in the way.'

283
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:10,494
These things are a two-way street.

284
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:15,844
Perhaps your son wasn't sensitive
in seeing how your life was changing.

285
00:21:16,234 --> 00:21:21,149
'You've got that right! I've been telling
him that ever since I got there!'

286
00:21:21,531 --> 00:21:24,284
I'm sure he appreciated your candour.

287
00:21:24,576 --> 00:21:26,965
'Sometimes
I oughta keep my trap shut.'

288
00:21:27,245 --> 00:21:30,203
That's good advice for us all.

289
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:33,914
Anything else?

290
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:39,004
'I'm worried my son doesn't know that
I appreciate what he's done for me.'

291
00:21:39,382 --> 00:21:41,338
Why don't you tell him?

292
00:21:41,593 --> 00:21:43,549
'You know how it is
with fathers and sons.

293
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:46,158
'They have trouble saying that stuff.'

294
00:21:46,431 --> 00:21:51,744
Well, if it helps, I suspect
your son already knows how you feel.

295
00:21:55,982 --> 00:22:00,134
- Is that all?
- 'Yeah. Thank you, Dr Crane.'

296
00:22:00,487 --> 00:22:03,365
- My pleasure, Martin.
- 'You hear that? I said thank you!'

297
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:06,329
Yes, I heard.

298
00:22:10,997 --> 00:22:16,947
Dr Crane? Claire on line four is having
a problem getting over a relationship.

299
00:22:19,089 --> 00:22:21,603
Hello, Claire. I'm listening.

300
00:22:21,883 --> 00:22:24,272
'I'm, er...

301
00:22:24,552 --> 00:22:27,385
(Sobs) 'Well, I'm a mess!

302
00:22:27,681 --> 00:22:32,038
'Eight months ago my boyfriend and l
broke up. I just can't get over it.

303
00:22:32,435 --> 00:22:37,828
'The pain isn't going away. It's like
I'm in mourning or something.'

304
00:22:38,233 --> 00:22:41,782
Claire, you are in mourning.

305
00:22:42,112 --> 00:22:45,661
But you're not mourning
the loss of your boyfriend.

306
00:22:45,991 --> 00:22:51,509
You're mourning the loss of what
you thought your life was going to be.

307
00:22:51,913 --> 00:22:56,225
Let it go. Things don't always
work out how you plan.

308
00:22:56,584 --> 00:22:59,576
That's not necessarily bad.

309
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:03,269
Things have a way
of working out anyway.

310
00:23:03,591 --> 00:23:06,947
Have you ever heard of Lupe Velez?

311
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:18,315
# Hey baby, I hear the blues are calling
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

312
00:23:19,441 --> 00:23:20,396
# Oh, my!

313
00:23:20,608 --> 00:23:23,680
# And maybe I seem a bit confused
Well, maybe...

314
00:23:23,987 --> 00:23:27,423
# But I got you pegged!

315
00:23:27,741 --> 00:23:33,259
# But I don't know what to do with those
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

316
00:23:33,663 --> 00:23:35,654
# They're calling again #

317
00:23:36,374 --> 00:23:38,569
Good night, Seattle, we love you!
