1
00:00:07,637 --> 00:00:12,108
You've seen the executive offices,
the advertising offices, lunchroom.

2
00:00:12,478 --> 00:00:16,869
We have now come
to the sanctum sanctorum: My studio.

3
00:00:17,236 --> 00:00:20,626
- You recognise that handsome rogue?
- Wow!

4
00:00:20,951 --> 00:00:22,987
Your head photographs
even bigger than it is.

5
00:00:23,246 --> 00:00:25,237
Very droll

6
00:00:25,876 --> 00:00:28,834
We in the radio game
call this "the booth".

7
00:00:29,131 --> 00:00:34,080
It's here that i help the emotionally
distraught through their troubled lives.

8
00:00:34,473 --> 00:00:37,670
Mmm. Suppose this stuff's bulletproof?

9
00:00:37,979 --> 00:00:41,688
You could have gone home after lunch.
I thought you'd enjoy this.

10
00:00:42,027 --> 00:00:44,905
Don't touch!
It's sophisticated equipment.

11
00:00:45,199 --> 00:00:48,157
- What is it?
- I have no idea. Roz said not to touch it.

12
00:00:49,623 --> 00:00:52,012
- The usual procedure is...
- testing, testing...

13
00:00:52,294 --> 00:00:56,606
dad, let's go into roz's booth.
You can touch anything in there.

14
00:00:58,096 --> 00:01:01,805
Hey, frasier.
Hi, mr crane. What brings you here?

15
00:01:02,143 --> 00:01:04,179
He's gonna listen to the show.

16
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:09,354
When frasier was a kid, i'd take him
to the police station where i worked.

17
00:01:09,739 --> 00:01:13,527
Yes, he used to make a game
of locking us in a cell

18
00:01:13,871 --> 00:01:16,431
and pretending to lose the key.

19
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:20,463
- I knew they weren't scared.
- We weren't.

20
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,597
But after a while became quite hungry.

21
00:01:23,887 --> 00:01:27,596
- Frasier, can you lend me ten bucks?
- Did you forget your wallet?

22
00:01:27,936 --> 00:01:31,087
No, i gave my last money
to this poor guy in front of the building.

23
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,597
He's an australian tourist
who just needed ten dollars...

24
00:01:34,906 --> 00:01:38,455
- for a cab to the consulate?
- How did you know?

25
00:01:38,787 --> 00:01:41,904
There is no
australian consulate in seattle.

26
00:01:42,209 --> 00:01:44,325
Oh, that poor guy.

27
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:49,126
Roz, he scammed you.

28
00:01:49,388 --> 00:01:51,856
No, this guy was for real.
He even said...

29
00:01:52,143 --> 00:01:55,180
"give me your address.
I'll send the money back with interest."

30
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:57,200
God...

31
00:01:57,443 --> 00:02:00,082
- i'm an idiot.
- No, don't feel bad.

32
00:02:00,364 --> 00:02:02,639
These guys are professionals.

33
00:02:02,911 --> 00:02:05,027
Don't touch that!

34
00:02:06,166 --> 00:02:10,364
What is this place?
A radio station or a nuclear missile site?

35
00:02:10,715 --> 00:02:16,153
Don't feel bad. I was a cop for 30 years,
and they still fake me out occasionally.

36
00:02:16,558 --> 00:02:20,836
- These guys know what to do.
- Especially with easy marks like roz.

37
00:02:21,191 --> 00:02:24,228
The criminal mind is complex.
They can fool you.

38
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:28,079
Oh, lecture me
on the complexities of the human mind.

39
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:31,322
I graduated in psychosocial behaviour.

40
00:02:31,624 --> 00:02:33,819
I know, i was at your graduation -

41
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:37,762
a car backfired
and half of them wet their gowns.

42
00:02:38,094 --> 00:02:40,608
It sounded louder on the dais.

43
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,978
Well, i wouldn't have been fooled.

44
00:02:45,272 --> 00:02:48,628
Oh, you think you can
spot a crook just like that?

45
00:02:48,945 --> 00:02:53,336
- If i can't, i'm in the wrong business.
- You want to bet on that?

46
00:02:53,703 --> 00:02:57,013
- Oh, what do you mean?
- It's poker night tonight.

47
00:02:57,333 --> 00:03:00,405
Two of the players are cops,
the third one's done time.

48
00:03:00,714 --> 00:03:03,023
Five bucks says
you can't tell the ex-con.

49
00:03:03,302 --> 00:03:05,452
- Can i get in on the action?
- Of course.

50
00:03:05,723 --> 00:03:07,998
Great. Ten bucks on your dad.

51
00:03:09,187 --> 00:03:11,382
You're itching to give your money away.

52
00:03:11,648 --> 00:03:14,003
You're on,
but you're underestimating me.

53
00:03:14,278 --> 00:03:19,272
What troubles are to pigs so are
these charlatans to my mental acuity!

54
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:24,539
We didn't know better back then.
His mother smoked during pregnancy.

55
00:03:30,931 --> 00:03:33,684
Who are these people
coming over tonight?

56
00:03:33,977 --> 00:03:36,491
Dad's old friends from the precinct.

57
00:03:36,774 --> 00:03:39,572
Someone should have been cleaned up

58
00:03:39,862 --> 00:03:42,854
because someone
hasn't been smelling so fresh lately.

59
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:46,071
Because someone
is long overdue for a tub.

60
00:03:46,373 --> 00:03:48,887
I've had a shower.

61
00:03:49,169 --> 00:03:52,241
Eddie is long overdue for a ba...

62
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:54,666
- don't say that word.
- What word?

63
00:03:54,929 --> 00:03:56,999
B-a-t-h.

64
00:04:00,813 --> 00:04:04,169
His yawns may smell like swamp gas,
but his spelling's improving.

65
00:04:05,279 --> 00:04:06,917
 

66
00:04:08,075 --> 00:04:10,066
I've made meatball sandwiches,

67
00:04:10,329 --> 00:04:14,288
pepperoni pizzas and sausage rolls.
Will you need anything else?

68
00:04:14,627 --> 00:04:17,903
The number of
the nearest gastroenterologist.

69
00:04:18,217 --> 00:04:21,015
Hey, come in.
These are my poker pals.

70
00:04:21,306 --> 00:04:23,945
Linda, frank and jimmy.
This is my son, frasier.

71
00:04:24,227 --> 00:04:26,616
Linda, frank, jimmy, nice to meet you.

72
00:04:26,898 --> 00:04:29,253
Throw your coats on the couch.

73
00:04:33,367 --> 00:04:36,882
Hard to tell, isn't it?
They all look like they did time!

74
00:04:39,126 --> 00:04:42,084
My dad tells me,
he's filled you in on our little bet.

75
00:04:42,381 --> 00:04:46,260
I'm not allowed to ask
any questions about your line of work,

76
00:04:46,597 --> 00:04:49,669
but whatever questions i do ask
you must answer truthfully.

77
00:04:49,977 --> 00:04:53,572
- I just want to play cards.
- Great place you got, marty.

78
00:04:53,901 --> 00:04:56,256
- Thanks.
- Actually, it's mine.

79
00:04:56,531 --> 00:04:58,806
Your radio show must do well.

80
00:04:59,076 --> 00:05:01,636
- Is this about 2,000 square feet?
- Yeah, about.

81
00:05:04,042 --> 00:05:07,114
Hm, that's interesting.
You noticed the space.

82
00:05:07,423 --> 00:05:12,372
Most people mention the view or high
ceilings, but you mentioned the space.

83
00:05:12,765 --> 00:05:17,202
It's almost as if you'd spent time
living in a cramped, confining area.

84
00:05:17,565 --> 00:05:20,159
You've been
to jimmy's apartment, huh?

85
00:05:20,444 --> 00:05:22,639
- Hello, there.
- Hi, daphne.

86
00:05:22,907 --> 00:05:27,264
This is daphne moon. These are
my friends. Linda, frank, jimmy.

87
00:05:27,623 --> 00:05:30,421
Daphne - pretty name.
Do people call you daffy?

88
00:05:30,712 --> 00:05:32,703
Not twice.

89
00:05:35,052 --> 00:05:39,011
It's nice to meet all of you.
I've got beers for everyone.

90
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:44,947
- Still drinking ballantine's, i see.
- When you kick off, they'll go bust.

91
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,920
Often, i come home
and see cans lined up,

92
00:05:48,198 --> 00:05:50,951
one after another like
little tin soldiers...

93
00:05:51,245 --> 00:05:53,634
thanks. Don't you have a dog to wash?

94
00:05:53,917 --> 00:05:55,908
Well, i suppose i do.

95
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:58,968
Of course
i have to catch the bugger first.

96
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:02,807
- Maybe one of these would help.
- Beer's not good for dogs.

97
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:05,779
No, but it's super for me.

98
00:06:07,146 --> 00:06:10,104
- She's pretty nice.
- Sexy, too, you dirty old man.

99
00:06:10,402 --> 00:06:14,111
- Oh...
- interesting.

100
00:06:16,036 --> 00:06:18,869
You find her attractive, do you?

101
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,989
Sure. Don't you?

102
00:06:27,264 --> 00:06:29,698
Yes, but attraction to one's own sex

103
00:06:29,976 --> 00:06:32,934
is a not uncommon result
of long periods of time

104
00:06:33,231 --> 00:06:35,665
spent exclusively in their company.

105
00:06:37,822 --> 00:06:40,211
- I may have underestimated you.
- Really?

106
00:06:40,493 --> 00:06:43,610
Yeah, you're making a bigger jackass
of yourself than i thought.

107
00:06:43,915 --> 00:06:46,270
High card deals.

108
00:06:46,545 --> 00:06:49,981
We could use some music.
Anybody play the harmonica?

109
00:06:54,182 --> 00:06:57,777
All right, my deal.
Dollar ante to start. Five-card draw.

110
00:06:58,106 --> 00:07:02,065
- Three-raise maximum.
- You sure you won't play?

111
00:07:02,404 --> 00:07:05,316
Oh, no, no.
I'll just observe the triumvirate.

112
00:07:05,618 --> 00:07:09,497
I will use my considerable education
and not to mention...

113
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:14,429
well, all right, let's say it -
my god-given gift to intuit.

114
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:19,798
This is the kid who used to
get his head flushed in the toilet, right?

115
00:07:25,777 --> 00:07:31,249
- All right, i call. What you got?
- Full boat, aces up.

116
00:07:31,661 --> 00:07:35,097
Damn it, that's another one.
I'm losing my shirt here.

117
00:07:35,417 --> 00:07:37,647
Would somebody help me
with the coffee?

118
00:07:37,921 --> 00:07:39,718
- I will.
- Ok.

119
00:07:40,926 --> 00:07:43,281
- I like your accent, you're from?
- Manchester.

120
00:07:43,555 --> 00:07:47,514
- Where the beatles are from, right?
- Oh, no. That's liverpool.

121
00:07:47,854 --> 00:07:49,924
- Who's from manchester?
- No one.

122
00:07:50,191 --> 00:07:52,910
That's why i live here now.

123
00:07:53,196 --> 00:07:55,426
You've been awfully quiet.

124
00:07:55,701 --> 00:07:58,215
- Sorry, just observing.
- No, don't apologise.

125
00:07:58,497 --> 00:08:00,692
It was a compliment.

126
00:08:02,211 --> 00:08:04,520
Frank's an interesting study.

127
00:08:04,799 --> 00:08:07,233
Temper, ioner, bit unsocial.

128
00:08:07,512 --> 00:08:12,108
Almost stereotypical of a man
who spent his entire life behind bars.

129
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:15,436
This dish a lalique or a steuben?

130
00:08:17,278 --> 00:08:19,234
They had no spots in the laundry.

131
00:08:19,489 --> 00:08:22,049
He worked in
fine china and glasswares.

132
00:08:26,084 --> 00:08:29,963
Here you go, big winner.
Buy yourself something pretty and frilly.

133
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:36,960
Sorry, frank, i can't hear you.
I've got your money stuck in my ears.

134
00:08:37,353 --> 00:08:39,787
I guess there's only one thing left.

135
00:08:40,066 --> 00:08:42,421
How about it? Figured it out yet?

136
00:08:42,695 --> 00:08:44,651
I believe i have.

137
00:08:44,907 --> 00:08:49,537
Shall we step into the drawing room?
Please have a seat.

138
00:08:49,915 --> 00:08:53,510
Ok, sherlock,
you got centre stage.

139
00:08:54,965 --> 00:08:58,844
I have sketched an accurate
psychological profile of you all,

140
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:03,014
and have come
to the incontrovertible conclusion

141
00:09:03,354 --> 00:09:06,824
that the criminal among us
can only be...

142
00:09:07,151 --> 00:09:10,302
...frank!
- Wrong. Frank's an undercover cop.

143
00:09:10,616 --> 00:09:12,607
Exactly!

144
00:09:15,124 --> 00:09:17,194
Just a little too obvious.

145
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:20,418
The broken vocabulary, jailhouse pallor,

146
00:09:20,716 --> 00:09:23,594
- the underdeveloped social skills...
- hey!

147
00:09:23,887 --> 00:09:27,482
You used psychology,
threw a gender-bender at me,

148
00:09:27,811 --> 00:09:30,769
thinking i would assume
a felon would be a man.

149
00:09:31,066 --> 00:09:33,216
Well, i'm on to you, mister.

150
00:09:33,487 --> 00:09:36,445
The criminal is the very wily linda!

151
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:38,574
- Nope.
- Jimmy!

152
00:09:40,331 --> 00:09:43,482
- You're right.
- Damn...

153
00:09:43,795 --> 00:09:46,628
- but you seem like such a nice guy.
- I am a nice guy.

154
00:09:46,925 --> 00:09:49,359
He was voted
most congenial in his cell block.

155
00:09:51,308 --> 00:09:54,539
- Sorry. You owe your dad five bucks.
- I'm afraid i do.

156
00:09:54,855 --> 00:09:58,564
Oh. You could probably use this.

157
00:10:00,364 --> 00:10:03,322
It's been a lot of laughs, but it's late.
We better get going.

158
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:06,373
- Yeah, thanks, marty.
- Yeah, it was great.

159
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:09,100
You all come again anytime you like.

160
00:10:09,379 --> 00:10:11,688
Hopefully, when we're here, of course.

161
00:10:13,512 --> 00:10:15,264
- Good night.
- See you.

162
00:10:15,515 --> 00:10:17,187
Next week.

163
00:10:20,356 --> 00:10:24,429
Jimmy. Who'd have thought?
How do you even know that guy?

164
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:27,658
He was a jailhouse snitch.
He helped us.

165
00:10:27,952 --> 00:10:31,865
I wouldn't trust him
if he wasn't surrounded by cops.

166
00:10:32,209 --> 00:10:34,165
- Who was a snitch?
- Jimmy.

167
00:10:34,421 --> 00:10:37,777
- Jimmy's an ex-con?
- You proved your point.

168
00:10:38,093 --> 00:10:40,607
I feel stupid as hell.

169
00:10:40,889 --> 00:10:43,767
- I feel a fool myself.
- Why would you care?

170
00:10:44,061 --> 00:10:47,576
I've agreed to go out
with jimmy tomorrow night.

171
00:10:47,901 --> 00:10:51,780
- What?
- He asked if i'd like to go for drinks

172
00:10:52,117 --> 00:10:55,905
at the topaz room.
It sounded harmless.

173
00:10:56,248 --> 00:10:58,921
It's out of the question! Cancel!

174
00:10:59,211 --> 00:11:01,679
You said yourself
he was fun to spend time with.

175
00:11:01,966 --> 00:11:03,957
I said do time with.

176
00:11:04,219 --> 00:11:08,531
No, no. You can't go. Case closed.

177
00:11:08,894 --> 00:11:13,126
Forget that police mentality.
Don't you believe in second chances?

178
00:11:13,485 --> 00:11:15,715
I did, then we had niles.

179
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:21,471
When a man
has paid his debt to society,

180
00:11:21,749 --> 00:11:24,138
he deserves a fresh start.

181
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,376
- She's not going.
- She is!

182
00:11:26,632 --> 00:11:28,748
- She isn't!
- She is!

183
00:11:29,011 --> 00:11:34,608
Excuse me. Might i interject one tiny
thought into this conversation?

184
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,976
Belt up, both of you!

185
00:11:37,233 --> 00:11:40,430
It may have escaped your notice,
but i'm a grown woman.

186
00:11:40,738 --> 00:11:45,892
Nobody has told me whom to date
since school. And i didn't listen then.

187
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:50,441
Now, when i've decided what i'll do
about jimmy, i'll let you know.

188
00:11:50,797 --> 00:11:54,756
I'm going to my room! You two hens
have wasted enough of my time.

189
00:12:00,729 --> 00:12:02,685
That would have been
a very dramatic exit,

190
00:12:02,942 --> 00:12:06,093
if only her room was down that hall.

191
00:12:15,171 --> 00:12:17,127
She shouldn't go out with that guy.

192
00:12:17,382 --> 00:12:19,577
- She won't.
- How do you know?

193
00:12:19,845 --> 00:12:22,837
She won't go against your wishes
if i'm any judge of character.

194
00:12:23,142 --> 00:12:25,940
Oh, dear god.

195
00:12:28,358 --> 00:12:30,314
What can i get you?

196
00:12:30,571 --> 00:12:34,928
- I'll have a decaf latte with skim milk.
- I'll have the same.

197
00:12:35,287 --> 00:12:37,642
Got it. Two gutless wonders!

198
00:12:41,004 --> 00:12:43,472
Thank you!
Certainly playing fast and loose

199
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:46,876
with tips for a man who drives a van.

200
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:54,547
Oh! How was your encounter
with dad's poker buddies last night?

201
00:12:54,944 --> 00:12:59,574
The picture of you trying to converse
with dad's cronies is priceless.

202
00:12:59,953 --> 00:13:04,743
When i told maris, it was all she could
do to keep her eyes from dancing.

203
00:13:05,127 --> 00:13:09,598
It was rather interesting.
One of them did time in prison for fraud.

204
00:13:09,969 --> 00:13:12,642
- Good lord! What was he like?
- Quite personable.

205
00:13:12,932 --> 00:13:15,207
- Dad's so judgemental.
- He is,

206
00:13:15,478 --> 00:13:17,912
and i've often condemned him for it.

207
00:13:20,361 --> 00:13:23,910
Just because the man was in prison
he seems to be marked for life.

208
00:13:24,242 --> 00:13:26,631
Ridiculous.
Not all criminals are recidivists.

209
00:13:26,913 --> 00:13:33,022
Many have gone on to lead productive
lives. Dad's just being narrow-minded.

210
00:13:33,465 --> 00:13:35,421
I almost had to sedate him

211
00:13:35,678 --> 00:13:38,511
when daphne
said she was going out with him.

212
00:13:39,726 --> 00:13:41,603
 

213
00:13:44,985 --> 00:13:48,660
I hope you're just
yanking my giggle chain.

214
00:13:48,991 --> 00:13:50,788
What do you mean?

215
00:13:51,037 --> 00:13:55,076
You're letting this delicate english rose
be sullied by some sociopath?

216
00:13:55,419 --> 00:13:57,979
Oh... niles, he passed bad cheques.

217
00:13:58,257 --> 00:14:00,817
- He's no sociopath.
- This degenerate should be put away.

218
00:14:01,094 --> 00:14:04,052
- You haven't even met him.
- They're all depraved animals!

219
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:07,342
- Here's your coffee. Anything else?
- Yes, the cheque, quickly!

220
00:14:07,648 --> 00:14:10,037
- We've got to rescue her.
- Just sit down.

221
00:14:10,318 --> 00:14:13,196
- You're being irrational.
- Don't call me irrational!

222
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:16,243
You know that makes me crazy!

223
00:14:17,914 --> 00:14:23,989
Now, niles, jimmy's a nice guy.
And daphne can take care of herself.

224
00:14:24,425 --> 00:14:28,543
I don't care. I'm not without resources.
My tae kwon do instructor says,

225
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:32,849
i'm just two moves away
from becoming quite threatening.

226
00:14:36,194 --> 00:14:40,073
Niles, just listen to me.
She'll resent any interference.

227
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:42,719
Go and make a fool of yourself,
but i won't.

228
00:14:42,998 --> 00:14:47,230
- Fine. Tell me where they went.
- The, er, topaz room.

229
00:14:47,589 --> 00:14:51,025
I thought the cops
shut it down after the last shooting.

230
00:14:51,344 --> 00:14:53,494
I'll drive!

231
00:15:07,622 --> 00:15:09,977
Your shot, girlie.

232
00:15:15,301 --> 00:15:17,769
Why don't we make
this more interesting?

233
00:15:18,055 --> 00:15:21,684
All you have to do to win is
run those last five balls.

234
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:26,093
- Let's double our bet.
- Oh, well, i might as well.

235
00:15:26,444 --> 00:15:29,720
I never really have
understood this game.

236
00:15:30,033 --> 00:15:32,786
I never understood
it when i first played it

237
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:36,038
with my older brothers
at the age of six.

238
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:39,930
And i never understood it
during my formative years,

239
00:15:40,258 --> 00:15:43,773
spent mostly
in the pool halls of manchester.

240
00:15:44,098 --> 00:15:48,057
I played in local competitions
and club tournaments...

241
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:53,260
...winning cup after cup,

242
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:58,650
until our poor dad had to convert
the pantry into a trophy room.

243
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:06,238
I can't claim to understand it -
eight ball in far corner -

244
00:16:06,635 --> 00:16:09,024
even today.

245
00:16:10,726 --> 00:16:13,798
But i certainly do enjoy it.

246
00:16:16,109 --> 00:16:19,306
Thank you, gentlemen.
And now, if you'll excuse me,

247
00:16:19,614 --> 00:16:23,243
i'm going to try to use the ladies' room
without touching anything.

248
00:16:35,223 --> 00:16:38,613
Look at this place!
I've never felt so conspicuous in my life.

249
00:16:38,938 --> 00:16:41,896
We'll simply try to blend in.
Fortunately...

250
00:16:44,405 --> 00:16:49,115
fortunately, i haven't shaved for hours.
You should loosen your tie.

251
00:16:49,498 --> 00:16:54,128
- Try tucking in your watch fob.
- That's a phi beta kappa key.

252
00:16:54,506 --> 00:16:59,944
Oh, then by all means let it dangle.
Perhaps they have a local chapter.

253
00:17:01,685 --> 00:17:05,121
Actually, this is quite stimulating
in a lower-depths way.

254
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:08,000
I'm something of a squalor buff.

255
00:17:08,278 --> 00:17:11,429
The only problem is
i don't see daphne or jimmy.

256
00:17:11,742 --> 00:17:13,733
 

257
00:17:14,914 --> 00:17:16,870
Excuse me.

258
00:17:23,053 --> 00:17:26,887
Has a young woman been here -
approximately 5ft 93/4,

259
00:17:27,226 --> 00:17:31,299
skin the colour of devonshire cream
and eyes that gaze into one's soul

260
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:34,210
with neither artifice nor evasion?

261
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:40,333
This would be
an englishwoman named daphne.

262
00:17:40,623 --> 00:17:43,820
Oh, the one that came in with jimmy.
She was shooting pool.

263
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:46,484
- She's in the back.
- What happened to jimmy?

264
00:17:46,759 --> 00:17:50,832
He tried to get fresh with her.
She threw a hammerlock, ran him out.

265
00:17:51,183 --> 00:17:54,300
- That babe can take care of herself.
- I told you so.

266
00:17:54,605 --> 00:17:56,800
Guy was no good.

267
00:17:57,068 --> 00:18:00,344
I knew it the first time i saw him.
You can always tell.

268
00:18:00,656 --> 00:18:02,851
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

269
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:06,354
You've had your walk
on the wild side. Let's go.

270
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:09,185
- What about daphne?
- You heard what she did.

271
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:13,058
- She'll be mad if she finds us here.
- Let's make ourselves scarce.

272
00:18:13,386 --> 00:18:15,581
Good lord, there she is.

273
00:18:15,848 --> 00:18:18,487
- Oh, i'm sorry.
- What the hell are you doing?

274
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:21,159
- I'm sorry...
- you made me miss that shot.

275
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,159
- I'm sorry.
- I had 200 bucks on that shot.

276
00:18:24,445 --> 00:18:26,675
Really sorry.

277
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:29,810
- Where are you going?
- I'll be back.

278
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,514
I'll just put another quarter in the meter.

279
00:18:32,793 --> 00:18:35,910
The meters don't run at night
and neither do you.

280
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:39,252
An amusing play on words!
A regular george s kaufman.

281
00:18:39,554 --> 00:18:42,068
We must tell our friends
about this place.

282
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:46,866
- You owe me $200.
- I don't have that kind of cash on me.

283
00:18:47,233 --> 00:18:52,261
It would be absurd to bring it into a
place like this with the kind of element...

284
00:18:52,659 --> 00:18:56,777
- maybe i could write you a cheque?
- My element don't take cheques.

285
00:18:57,125 --> 00:19:00,401
Maybe we should take
these guys outside and wise them up.

286
00:19:00,714 --> 00:19:02,625
Oh, that's not necessary...

287
00:19:02,884 --> 00:19:07,753
- goodness! What are you doing here?
- We might ask you the same thing.

288
00:19:08,143 --> 00:19:10,338
This is one of our favourite haunts.

289
00:19:12,024 --> 00:19:14,982
Actually, maris and i
had our rehearsal dinner here.

290
00:19:16,865 --> 00:19:20,221
It was different then.
It was more of a garden room...

291
00:19:20,538 --> 00:19:22,369
shut up, niles.

292
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:26,379
- You followed me, didn't you?
- We were worried.

293
00:19:26,715 --> 00:19:31,152
Excuse me, it seems
your friends can't pay the 200 they owe,

294
00:19:31,515 --> 00:19:35,303
so i'll have to - pardon my french -
beat the crap out of them.

295
00:19:35,647 --> 00:19:39,435
I'm a psychiatrist. Maybe we could
take this out in sessions.

296
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:42,815
- Outside!
- Wait!

297
00:19:43,118 --> 00:19:46,554
I have money. Would you like to go
for double or nothing?

298
00:19:46,873 --> 00:19:51,503
- On what?
- Well, you look like a betting man.

299
00:19:51,881 --> 00:19:55,954
I'll wager i can sink
these five balls with a single shot.

300
00:19:57,850 --> 00:20:01,684
If i do, these boys are square.
If i miss, you double your money.

301
00:20:02,023 --> 00:20:06,619
I'll take your money, but i was
looking forward to pulping this guy.

302
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:09,060
Yeah, well, we won't quibble.

303
00:20:09,327 --> 00:20:14,242
If i miss, you can pulp him.
I'm feeling generous tonight.

304
00:20:14,627 --> 00:20:18,063
- I'll throw in the little one too.
- "Throw in the little one"?

305
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:21,420
And what in god's name is pulping?

306
00:20:21,723 --> 00:20:23,759
You're on.

307
00:20:24,728 --> 00:20:29,597
Ok, just to make sure this is
on the up-and-up, let's use six balls.

308
00:20:29,986 --> 00:20:35,106
Instead of sinking all five with one shot,
how about sinking all six?

309
00:20:35,496 --> 00:20:39,774
Do that and i'll forget the 200 bucks.

310
00:20:41,672 --> 00:20:44,140
Fair enough.

311
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:51,794
Need a bit of chalk for me cue.

312
00:21:00,578 --> 00:21:02,887
Does it matter
in what order i make them?

313
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:05,122
Daphne!

314
00:21:06,045 --> 00:21:09,162
Hey, lady, if you make
any of them, it'll be a miracle.

315
00:21:09,468 --> 00:21:11,220
Right.

316
00:21:11,471 --> 00:21:14,668
Well... here goes nothing.

317
00:21:48,908 --> 00:21:51,297
Run for it!

318
00:21:55,711 --> 00:21:57,064
 

319
00:22:04,558 --> 00:22:08,676
# Hey, baby, i hear the blues a-calling
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

320
00:22:09,692 --> 00:22:11,330
# quite stylish

321
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:17,361
# and maybe i seem a bit confused
yeah, maybe... but i got you pegged!

322
00:22:18,791 --> 00:22:22,500
# But i don't know what to do with those
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

323
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:28,032
# they're calling again

324
00:22:28,431 --> 00:22:33,107
# scrambled eggs all over my face
what is a boy to do? #

325
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:37,380
good night, everybody!
