1
00:00:07,637 --> 00:00:11,471
lt's 4:25, and this is Dr Frasier Crane.

2
00:00:11,811 --> 00:00:15,963
- Who's our next caller?
- Hank has trouble with his neighbours.

3
00:00:16,318 --> 00:00:18,912
Hello, Hank, l'm listening.

4
00:00:19,197 --> 00:00:21,586
- 'Am l on?'
- Yes, you're on the air.

5
00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:24,702
'Hello, am l on?'

6
00:00:24,999 --> 00:00:29,709
Hank, listen. Turn down your radio
and just talk into your phone.

7
00:00:30,091 --> 00:00:31,729
'Hello?'

8
00:00:31,969 --> 00:00:36,201
You won't be able to hear yourself.
We're on a seven-second delay.

9
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,393
'Hello, can you hear me?'

10
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:42,250
For crying out loud! Thank you, Hank.

11
00:00:42,528 --> 00:00:45,281
People, turn off your damn radios!

12
00:00:46,785 --> 00:00:49,538
Ah, no, l mean just those of you
who are calling in!

13
00:00:49,831 --> 00:00:51,503
Who's our next caller?

14
00:00:51,752 --> 00:00:55,222
Marco has relationship problems.

15
00:00:55,549 --> 00:00:58,302
Hello, Marco, l'm listening.

16
00:00:58,596 --> 00:01:03,033
'l started seeing this woman
two years ago.

17
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:07,674
'l think it was two years.
lt was around Thanksgiving...

18
00:01:08,028 --> 00:01:10,496
'Yeah,
the leaves were off the trees and...'

19
00:01:10,783 --> 00:01:12,739
Close enough.

20
00:01:14,163 --> 00:01:16,119
What is your problem?

21
00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:19,925
'lt's not really my problem,
it's more like her problem.

22
00:01:20,257 --> 00:01:24,136
- 'She's pressing me for a commitment.'
- What's holding you back?

23
00:01:24,472 --> 00:01:30,866
'l want to keep my options open,
in case somebody better comes along.'

24
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,920
"Somebody better comes along."

25
00:01:35,198 --> 00:01:39,874
"Somebody better comes along!"
Marco, do you hear yourself?

26
00:01:40,248 --> 00:01:45,083
'No, l turned my radio off
after you blasted that other guy.'

27
00:01:48,721 --> 00:01:52,714
Listen, l suggest you give
your motives a thorough examination,

28
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:56,655
and if you can't commit,
it's best for both of you to break it off.

29
00:01:56,984 --> 00:02:00,260
- 'Yeah?'
- Yeah! Thank you for your call.

30
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:04,362
Tell me, what is it with guys like that?

31
00:02:04,663 --> 00:02:08,212
Hey, Roz, you've been
around the block a few times.

32
00:02:08,544 --> 00:02:10,660
Ever run into a guy like Marco?

33
00:02:10,924 --> 00:02:12,880
Oh, they're all Marcos.

34
00:02:13,178 --> 00:02:16,170
You can't swing
a dead cat without hitting a Marco.

35
00:02:16,475 --> 00:02:20,184
lf that was so,
no one would be having a relationship.

36
00:02:20,523 --> 00:02:24,357
Well, l'm not,
my sister's not, none of my friends are.

37
00:02:24,696 --> 00:02:27,494
l've seen the future. lts name is Marco.

38
00:02:29,287 --> 00:02:33,644
What do you think, Seattle?
Are there any non-Marcos out there,

39
00:02:34,003 --> 00:02:38,872
or is Roz destined to live a life
of hopeless, loveless spinsterhood?

40
00:02:39,262 --> 00:02:41,093
Back after this.

41
00:02:41,349 --> 00:02:44,307
Gee, l just love it
when you include me in your show.

42
00:02:49,362 --> 00:02:51,637
This is weird.
lt's not even Halloween yet.

43
00:02:51,908 --> 00:02:54,058
Do we have to do this now?

44
00:02:54,328 --> 00:02:57,957
Yes, if we want a picture
for the Christmas card.

45
00:02:58,294 --> 00:03:01,286
Why can't we just do
what my wife and l did -

46
00:03:01,591 --> 00:03:06,062
put Frasier and Niles, in matching
sweaters, on the old Packard.

47
00:03:06,432 --> 00:03:09,663
Well, this year we're going to be
a little more artistic.

48
00:03:09,979 --> 00:03:12,174
Where is Frasier? l could use help.

49
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:15,991
He's still napping.
My grandfather used to nap every day.

50
00:03:16,365 --> 00:03:18,595
- He lived to be 93.
- Really?

51
00:03:18,869 --> 00:03:21,861
He'd lie there on the sofa,
and you couldn't wake him.

52
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:24,919
Grammy would say,
"He might as well be a dead man."

53
00:03:25,213 --> 00:03:29,092
Then, one day, we couldn't wake him.

54
00:03:30,722 --> 00:03:33,441
He really was a dead man.

55
00:03:33,727 --> 00:03:40,200
Poor Grammy. For weeks, she kept
insisting: "'E's napping, 'e's napping."

56
00:03:40,655 --> 00:03:43,692
OK, l'm going to turn it on.

57
00:03:45,329 --> 00:03:47,718
Oh, it's lovely!

58
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,037
# Deck the halls with boughs of holly

59
00:03:51,339 --> 00:03:53,295
# Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la

60
00:03:53,552 --> 00:03:55,747
# 'Tis the season to be jolly

61
00:03:56,013 --> 00:03:58,368
# Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la

62
00:03:58,643 --> 00:04:00,873
# Don we now our gay apparel

63
00:04:01,147 --> 00:04:03,377
# Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la... #

64
00:04:03,651 --> 00:04:07,769
Excuse me, excuse me.
Exactly how long have l been asleep?

65
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:13,652
Good, you're up.
Now we can get this picture taken.

66
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:17,555
- What picture?
- The picture for the Christmas card.

67
00:04:17,884 --> 00:04:18,839
Oh, right.

68
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:23,124
The theme is Santa's workshop.
Put on your little elf hats.

69
00:04:23,475 --> 00:04:28,629
l'm not putting this on my head!
l'm a respected professional!

70
00:04:29,027 --> 00:04:31,541
But if you don't, it'll look stupid!

71
00:04:33,993 --> 00:04:36,666
The ship has already sailed on that one.

72
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:40,411
- Put the hat on!
- You can't tell me what to do.

73
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:42,467
l am telling you.

74
00:04:42,716 --> 00:04:47,506
You can no longer sit me
on top of some stupid old Packard!

75
00:04:47,891 --> 00:04:52,043
Boys, please, don't fight!
Are you forgetting what day it is?

76
00:04:52,398 --> 00:04:54,593
lt's October 21!

77
00:04:56,864 --> 00:05:00,300
- Can we just get the picture taken?
- l've got it all set.

78
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,736
15 seconds, gents.

79
00:05:02,999 --> 00:05:04,955
Oh wait, where's Eddie?

80
00:05:05,211 --> 00:05:08,089
ln the bathroom,
getting a drink. Eddie!

81
00:05:15,603 --> 00:05:20,119
Well, l can always pray
there's a postal strike.

82
00:05:22,281 --> 00:05:25,830
That's it for today.
This is Dr Frasier Crane saying,

83
00:05:26,162 --> 00:05:29,996
"Go out there
and make it a great evening, Seattle."

84
00:05:30,878 --> 00:05:34,348
Hey, there's a fan
in the hall who'd like your autograph.

85
00:05:34,676 --> 00:05:38,066
Oh, God, save me
from my adoring fans.

86
00:05:39,602 --> 00:05:42,321
Oh! But not from the adorable ones.

87
00:05:46,946 --> 00:05:51,622
Hello. You wanted an autograph?
Uh, how should l make this out?

88
00:05:51,997 --> 00:05:54,670
You disgust me, you parasitic fraud!

89
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,794
That's certainly different
from the usual "Best Regards".

90
00:05:59,133 --> 00:06:03,729
For once you'll face the consequences
of hanging up on callers!

91
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,091
What consequences?

92
00:06:06,354 --> 00:06:10,108
l'm Marco's girlfriend...
Excuse me, ex-girlfriend, thanks to you.

93
00:06:10,444 --> 00:06:12,639
The Marco who didn't want to commit?

94
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:17,502
You damned radio shrinks.
You couldn't just tell him to stick with it!

95
00:06:17,872 --> 00:06:22,070
That doesn't get big ratings. No!
"Get on with your life and ruin hers."

96
00:06:22,421 --> 00:06:25,936
- That's entertainment.
- Hold on. Did you listen to the show?

97
00:06:26,262 --> 00:06:30,460
- No, but Marco told me what you said.
- Oh, he did, did he?

98
00:06:30,811 --> 00:06:35,248
Did he mention he only stayed
with you to keep his options open?

99
00:06:36,904 --> 00:06:40,863
He said he only stayed with you
until somebody better came along.

100
00:06:42,622 --> 00:06:44,931
- He said that?
- To most of Seattle.

101
00:06:45,209 --> 00:06:48,599
Apparently, you're the only one
who missed it.

102
00:06:50,259 --> 00:06:52,614
So,
it wasn't that he didn't want to commit.

103
00:06:52,888 --> 00:06:56,005
He just didn't want to commit to me.

104
00:06:56,311 --> 00:07:00,941
l'm sorry l had to tell you,
but at least now you know the truth.

105
00:07:02,112 --> 00:07:03,431
Oh, no...

106
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:06,807
Don't...don't cry.

107
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,394
Look, you're...

108
00:07:08,623 --> 00:07:11,217
You're in a place of business here.

109
00:07:16,553 --> 00:07:20,068
Boy, l can really pick 'em, can't l?

110
00:07:20,392 --> 00:07:23,065
Don't go there.
Look, this is not your fault.

111
00:07:23,356 --> 00:07:28,589
You're a terrifically attractive young
woman, maybe a bit overemotional...

112
00:07:32,245 --> 00:07:34,964
Oh, yes, there, there, shh.

113
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:39,402
- Listen, can l get you something?
- Mm-mm.

114
00:07:39,758 --> 00:07:42,272
- A drink of water?
- No.

115
00:07:42,553 --> 00:07:44,032
M & M's?

116
00:07:46,644 --> 00:07:49,078
Plain or peanut?

117
00:07:49,357 --> 00:07:52,315
- Whichever you like.
- Peanut.

118
00:07:58,539 --> 00:08:02,851
God, l should have seen this coming.
He almost had a coronary,

119
00:08:03,213 --> 00:08:06,205
when l brought a toothbrush over
to keep at his apartment.

120
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:11,982
- Thank you. You want one?
- Uh, no, thanks. Have a seat.

121
00:08:12,395 --> 00:08:16,707
Listen, if he was that resistant,
why did you stay with him?

122
00:08:17,069 --> 00:08:19,025
l had a lot invested in it.

123
00:08:19,281 --> 00:08:23,115
Why settle for someone
who isn't madly in love with you?

124
00:08:23,455 --> 00:08:25,571
Right now
l'm not sure there are any men

125
00:08:25,834 --> 00:08:28,553
who are capable of falling madly in love.

126
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:30,272
There are.

127
00:08:30,508 --> 00:08:33,420
Men and women
are basically the same.

128
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:36,759
We both need to be loved
and to love someone,

129
00:08:37,061 --> 00:08:41,259
we both want to feel
that we matter to someone.

130
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:44,807
Making a commitment
to another human being

131
00:08:45,115 --> 00:08:47,754
is the ultimate expression
of our humanity.

132
00:08:48,037 --> 00:08:51,666
Wow.
Your wife is really lucky.

133
00:08:52,002 --> 00:08:57,156
Well, l'm...
sure she'd say the same thing.

134
00:08:57,552 --> 00:09:00,624
Especially now
that our marriage is over.

135
00:09:00,933 --> 00:09:03,845
Maybe l will have one of those M & M's.

136
00:09:05,942 --> 00:09:11,016
Oh, boy...
Why are relationships always so hard?

137
00:09:13,036 --> 00:09:17,746
- Hey! You like the yellow ones too?
- People tell you they're the same.

138
00:09:18,129 --> 00:09:20,484
- But they're not!
- No!

139
00:09:20,757 --> 00:09:22,987
Relationships don't have to be hard.

140
00:09:23,262 --> 00:09:28,655
l heard of a documented case where
a man and a woman met, got along,

141
00:09:29,063 --> 00:09:31,861
and actually lived happily ever after.

142
00:09:33,487 --> 00:09:37,275
l don't mind the happily-ever-after-part.
lt's the dating part.

143
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:40,735
lf l have to tell one more stranger
the story of my life

144
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:44,113
over Northern ltalian cuisine,
l'll choke on a breadstick!

145
00:09:44,422 --> 00:09:49,257
l know. Maybe we could just
exchange résumés over appetisers.

146
00:09:49,638 --> 00:09:53,870
- l usually say goodbye over appetisers.
- At least you're not stuck with the bill.

147
00:09:54,229 --> 00:09:57,107
You haven't dated much lately,
have you?

148
00:09:59,321 --> 00:10:02,996
No. l usually end up
in restaurants alone.

149
00:10:03,328 --> 00:10:05,364
l can't do that.

150
00:10:05,623 --> 00:10:07,818
l even turn on the TV at home

151
00:10:08,086 --> 00:10:10,156
so it feels
like there's someone else there.

152
00:10:11,132 --> 00:10:13,407
ls that what you'll be doing tonight?

153
00:10:18,186 --> 00:10:23,658
Well, unless l just keep eating M & M's,
which is a distinct possibility.

154
00:10:32,167 --> 00:10:37,878
Soft and supple, yet strong right down
to the beautiful almond-shaped nails.

155
00:10:38,302 --> 00:10:41,612
- You really see all that in my hand?
- Mm-hm.

156
00:10:43,144 --> 00:10:45,100
l'm late for work.

157
00:10:45,355 --> 00:10:50,793
Wait. What are we doing tonight?
"Antonio's", "Le Cigare Volant"?

158
00:10:51,198 --> 00:10:54,747
- Why don't we just stay in?
- That's a great idea!

159
00:10:55,080 --> 00:11:00,359
l'll send Dad and Daphne to the movies.
l'll cook for you. Be at my place at 8:00.

160
00:11:00,755 --> 00:11:02,905
l won't make it till 8:30. l must change.

161
00:11:03,177 --> 00:11:06,533
No! Don't ever change.
l like you just the way you are.

162
00:11:08,059 --> 00:11:10,368
Come on, l'm a little out of practice!

163
00:11:11,648 --> 00:11:13,878
l'll see you later, OK?

164
00:11:19,286 --> 00:11:20,605
Bye.

165
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:32,098
l'll dispense with
the usual adolescent teasing.

166
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:35,144
Who was that babe-o-rama?

167
00:11:36,523 --> 00:11:40,801
You remind me of Bob Hope
when he dresses up as the Fonz.

168
00:11:43,117 --> 00:11:46,393
- Her name is Catherine.
- How long have you known her?

169
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:49,504
- Three days.
- Have you two...?

170
00:11:49,795 --> 00:11:53,583
- No. As if it's any of your business.
- But you're...?

171
00:11:53,927 --> 00:11:55,883
Yes, soon!

172
00:11:58,184 --> 00:12:00,698
- We are talking about...?
- Of course we are!

173
00:12:04,987 --> 00:12:07,899
- Sex, right?
- Yes!

174
00:12:11,789 --> 00:12:14,064
So... How did you two meet?

175
00:12:14,335 --> 00:12:17,930
She came down to the radio station
to chew me out.

176
00:12:18,259 --> 00:12:22,138
- You're kidding.
- No. Her boyfriend called the show.

177
00:12:22,473 --> 00:12:25,749
l advised him to break up with her.

178
00:12:27,106 --> 00:12:29,825
Frasier, where are your ethics?

179
00:12:30,111 --> 00:12:33,342
You can't date someone
who's involved with your patient.

180
00:12:33,659 --> 00:12:36,890
Marco is not a patient, he's a caller.
There's a huge difference.

181
00:12:37,207 --> 00:12:39,357
l talked to him days before l met her.

182
00:12:39,627 --> 00:12:42,016
Rationalisation, the last refuge of a...

183
00:12:46,805 --> 00:12:50,684
l am not rationalising!
There is nothing wrong here!

184
00:12:51,021 --> 00:12:54,650
As long as your conscience is clear.
Mine wouldn't be.

185
00:12:54,985 --> 00:12:58,136
Well, frankly, l don't care
about your conscience.

186
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:02,728
l don't need your approval.
l don't need you for anything.

187
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:05,881
My car's in the shop.
l need a ride home tonight.

188
00:13:06,171 --> 00:13:08,002
No problem.

189
00:13:12,348 --> 00:13:14,304
l've got news for you,

190
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,835
Marco's on line two.

191
00:13:18,065 --> 00:13:19,020
Marco?

192
00:13:19,234 --> 00:13:23,671
The guy you got out of the
way so you could keep his girlfriend.

193
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:28,354
- Ten seconds.
- l'm not talking to him.

194
00:13:28,624 --> 00:13:31,184
There's no way l'm talking to him!

195
00:13:31,462 --> 00:13:32,736
Three, two...

196
00:13:32,965 --> 00:13:36,844
Hi, we're back.
Roz, whom do we have on the line?

197
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:39,978
We have Marco on line two.

198
00:13:42,564 --> 00:13:45,124
- Who's this on line three?
- Todd.

199
00:13:45,402 --> 00:13:47,393
Oops, we lost Todd.

200
00:13:49,743 --> 00:13:53,179
But lucky for you,
we still have Marco on line two.

201
00:13:53,498 --> 00:13:56,058
Thank you, Roz.

202
00:13:56,337 --> 00:13:58,726
- Hello, Marco.
- 'Hi, Dr Crane.

203
00:13:59,008 --> 00:14:03,877
'l spoke to you and l took your advice -
l broke up with my girlfriend.'

204
00:14:04,266 --> 00:14:08,623
Well, what can l say but
"Bravo, Marco"?

205
00:14:08,982 --> 00:14:10,938
- Who's next?
- 'Wait!

206
00:14:11,195 --> 00:14:15,234
'You haven't heard my problem.
She's already dating someone else.'

207
00:14:15,577 --> 00:14:18,853
- lt makes me nuts.
- What makes you think that?

208
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:24,320
'The other night, l couldn't get her
on the phone. So l drove by her house,

209
00:14:24,717 --> 00:14:28,107
'and l saw her outside
talking to some guy in a black BMW.'

210
00:14:29,725 --> 00:14:33,434
Did you, er,
get a good look at the guy?

211
00:14:36,486 --> 00:14:40,274
'No, it was too dark.
l think l made a big mistake, Doc.

212
00:14:40,618 --> 00:14:42,813
'Should l ask her to take me back?'

213
00:14:43,081 --> 00:14:45,311
No! l mean, what l mean is...

214
00:14:45,585 --> 00:14:49,578
No. Marco, you don't want
your ex-girlfriend back -

215
00:14:49,925 --> 00:14:52,120
you don't want
anybody else to have her.

216
00:14:52,388 --> 00:14:54,822
- 'Well, l...'
- No, it's called "jealousy".

217
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:58,649
You must stop spying on her
and get on with your life.

218
00:14:58,982 --> 00:15:02,372
Borrow a page from my book:
move to a new city. A new state.

219
00:15:02,696 --> 00:15:05,768
Find out why
everyone's talking about Pittsburgh!

220
00:15:07,955 --> 00:15:11,311
We'll be right back
after these messages.

221
00:15:12,713 --> 00:15:14,704
What?

222
00:15:16,887 --> 00:15:19,606
- 'Thanks for picking me up.'
- No problem.

223
00:15:19,934 --> 00:15:22,926
Just a few miles out of my way.
At rush hour.

224
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:27,348
But l didn't mind, really. Gave me
a chance to listen to your show.

225
00:15:27,696 --> 00:15:28,811
l see.

226
00:15:29,031 --> 00:15:31,386
l just have one question for you.

227
00:15:31,661 --> 00:15:34,050
Can you tell me
that your advice to Marco

228
00:15:34,332 --> 00:15:37,608
was based on his best interests,
and not on your own?

229
00:15:37,921 --> 00:15:40,993
That's an interesting question, Niles,
and l don't care.

230
00:15:41,301 --> 00:15:43,451
l'm in love, and l don't care.

231
00:15:43,722 --> 00:15:46,714
Catherine is mine now.
l'm in and Marco's out.

232
00:15:47,896 --> 00:15:50,888
- You're insane!
- Perhaps, but you just ran a stop sign.

233
00:15:52,487 --> 00:15:55,206
- Now we're in the intersection!
- Oh!

234
00:15:56,285 --> 00:16:00,483
l tell you, Niles,
l haven't felt this way in ages.

235
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:05,791
There's an excitement about this.
l...l feel tingly.

236
00:16:07,052 --> 00:16:10,567
- What does your stomach say?
- My stomach?

237
00:16:10,892 --> 00:16:13,565
You know what l'm talking about.

238
00:16:13,856 --> 00:16:17,769
Whenever you approached
a breach of ethics, you'd get queasy.

239
00:16:18,112 --> 00:16:21,582
At least l didn't get
spontaneous nosebleeds.

240
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:25,027
Remember when we lifted
that dollar from Mom's purse,

241
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:28,769
we left a gruesome
trail back to the tree house that day.

242
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:34,481
But, you see, you've proved my point.
l'm not the least bit queasy, l'm fine.

243
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:38,246
My head, my heart,
my gastrointestinal system, all shout,

244
00:16:38,563 --> 00:16:40,155
"lt's OK!"

245
00:16:41,568 --> 00:16:43,684
Niles, is this a new car?

246
00:16:43,946 --> 00:16:47,825
Yes, a patient of mine
got me a huge break on a lease.

247
00:16:50,917 --> 00:16:53,795
Frasier, do you have a handkerchief?

248
00:17:00,391 --> 00:17:03,588
Mm, that was the best
Salmon Marseille l've ever had.

249
00:17:03,896 --> 00:17:07,889
You should try
my Salmon "Enchanted Evening".

250
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:12,021
- Tell me you didn't say that.
- Oh, it was just the Lafite talking.

251
00:17:12,327 --> 00:17:14,477
Lafite, don't fail me now!

252
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:17,949
Oh, stop, stop!

253
00:17:22,093 --> 00:17:25,051
So...have you ever
made love in the kitchen?

254
00:17:28,729 --> 00:17:31,243
Well, the, uh...dishes are done.

255
00:17:36,033 --> 00:17:37,989
Oh! Mm!

256
00:17:46,258 --> 00:17:48,567
'Ewww!'

257
00:17:50,181 --> 00:17:52,331
'What?'

258
00:17:52,602 --> 00:17:56,356
l'm sorry,
l'm suddenly feeling a little queasy. l...

259
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,193
Maybe l'm just not a kitchen person.

260
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:08,361
Well, uh...

261
00:18:08,628 --> 00:18:12,621
Maybe you're just...
a little too warm, huh?

262
00:18:12,968 --> 00:18:14,287
- Yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

263
00:18:14,513 --> 00:18:15,912
Yeah, that's it.

264
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:19,849
- You look awfully warm too.
- Oh, l am! Yes.

265
00:18:20,189 --> 00:18:23,465
- Oh, my God!
- Oh! Oh!

266
00:18:25,906 --> 00:18:27,544
Ooh!

267
00:18:34,796 --> 00:18:36,548
l'm sorry.

268
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:39,996
Would you mind
if we moved to the sofa?

269
00:18:40,305 --> 00:18:43,217
l won't be outperformed
by a Barcalounger.

270
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:46,113
Oh... Oh!

271
00:18:46,816 --> 00:18:48,488
This is better.

272
00:18:48,736 --> 00:18:51,170
Oh, yes. Mm...

273
00:18:51,449 --> 00:18:53,246
Mm...

274
00:18:53,577 --> 00:18:55,488
Ewww!

275
00:18:55,748 --> 00:18:57,739
Ah...

276
00:18:58,961 --> 00:19:01,395
What? Was l kneeling on you?

277
00:19:01,674 --> 00:19:04,427
l need some fresh air. Are you OK?

278
00:19:04,721 --> 00:19:05,790
l'm fine.

279
00:19:06,014 --> 00:19:08,289
Oh, damn, it wasn't the fish!

280
00:19:09,186 --> 00:19:11,336
There's a bug going round.

281
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:16,120
- lt's not a bug.
- What is it, then?

282
00:19:17,283 --> 00:19:19,353
lt's us.

283
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:22,578
Every time we touch and kiss,
l get queasy.

284
00:19:24,336 --> 00:19:29,012
The thought of making love to me
makes you sick to your stomach?

285
00:19:29,386 --> 00:19:32,458
Yes, but don't take it personally.

286
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:38,040
lt's... lt's not you, it's me.

287
00:19:38,317 --> 00:19:42,788
Every time l come close
to breaching my ethics, l get sick.

288
00:19:43,159 --> 00:19:44,717
What?

289
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:50,142
Marco called and said
he wanted to get back with you.

290
00:19:50,504 --> 00:19:53,177
- l told him not to.
- So?

291
00:19:53,467 --> 00:19:58,746
Maybe l told him that not because
it was good for him but good for me.

292
00:19:59,144 --> 00:20:01,260
Oh, Frasier!

293
00:20:01,522 --> 00:20:03,911
Who cares?

294
00:20:04,193 --> 00:20:08,072
l care. Any psychiatrist worth his salt
would care.

295
00:20:08,409 --> 00:20:13,119
That's why we don't get involved
with our patients. Or their girlfriends.

296
00:20:15,421 --> 00:20:18,538
- Do you want to break up with me?
- l don't want to.

297
00:20:18,843 --> 00:20:22,233
l have to. lf l don't,
l'll throw up all over your shoes.

298
00:20:25,228 --> 00:20:30,586
l can't believe this is happening.
How can this be so easy for you?

299
00:20:30,988 --> 00:20:33,183
Easy? This is killing me!

300
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:36,169
l want to carry you
to that Eames classic

301
00:20:36,455 --> 00:20:40,004
and show you why it's
the best-engineered chair in the world!

302
00:20:41,338 --> 00:20:44,648
- Why don't you, then?
- l told you, l can't!

303
00:20:44,969 --> 00:20:48,518
Oh! And nothing l can say
will change your mind?

304
00:20:50,269 --> 00:20:51,543
l'm sorry.

305
00:20:51,772 --> 00:20:54,491
Well, thank you, Dr Crane!

306
00:20:55,862 --> 00:20:59,059
First you screw things up with Marco
and now you're dumping me!

307
00:20:59,368 --> 00:21:02,678
God, and to think
l was going to have sex with you!

308
00:21:02,998 --> 00:21:06,149
And it was going to be hot.

309
00:21:06,463 --> 00:21:09,853
Oh, like you've never had before!

310
00:21:10,177 --> 00:21:12,372
l'm talking steamy,

311
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:17,156
sweat dripping down your back,
neighbours pounding on the walls.

312
00:21:17,523 --> 00:21:20,879
lllegal in 48 states kind of sex!

313
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:26,062
But, hey. You're OK.
You won't be alone tonight.

314
00:21:26,371 --> 00:21:28,327
No, you've got your ethics!

315
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:30,175
Oh!

316
00:21:33,007 --> 00:21:34,838
Oh, by the way,

317
00:21:35,093 --> 00:21:37,891
The fish was dry.

318
00:21:38,182 --> 00:21:41,458
Oh, that was a cheap shot!

319
00:21:57,547 --> 00:22:01,335
How l envy you, Eddie.
The biggest questions you face are:

320
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:04,751
"Who's going to walk me?
Who's going to feed me?"

321
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:08,814
l won't know that kind of joy
for another 40 years.

322
00:22:13,865 --> 00:22:18,734
# Baby, l hear the blues a-calling
Tossed salads and scrambled eggs

323
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:20,774
# Quite stylish

324
00:22:21,002 --> 00:22:27,555
# Maybe l seem a bit confused
Well, maybe, but l got you pegged!

325
00:22:28,306 --> 00:22:32,743
# But l don't know what do with those
Tossed salads and scrambled eggs

326
00:22:34,066 --> 00:22:36,375
# They're calling again #

327
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:39,334
Good night, Seattle, we love you!
