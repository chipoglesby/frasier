1
00:00:08,514 --> 00:00:11,233
Oh, look, roz, my brochures are here!

2
00:00:11,518 --> 00:00:14,316
Oh, god, very exciting! Vacation!

3
00:00:14,606 --> 00:00:19,316
The golden door spa! Look at
those accommodations. That is nice!

4
00:00:19,699 --> 00:00:21,974
I'll leave dad to fend for himself,

5
00:00:22,244 --> 00:00:25,554
while i spend an obscene amount
being pampered like a child.

6
00:00:25,876 --> 00:00:31,189
What else are vacations for?
What are you doing for your week off?

7
00:00:31,594 --> 00:00:33,903
Oh, i'm taking my mom
to ireland to stay

8
00:00:34,181 --> 00:00:37,059
in the hovel
where her mother was born.

9
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,353
Just write the words "bad son"
on my forehead!

10
00:00:44,865 --> 00:00:47,504
You deserve to pamper yourself.

11
00:00:47,787 --> 00:00:50,506
After all,
you do work three hours a day.

12
00:00:54,297 --> 00:00:57,926
I'm sorry, that one even surprised me.

13
00:00:58,262 --> 00:01:01,379
When i think of the relationship
i have with my dad,

14
00:01:01,684 --> 00:01:04,994
i envy the relationship
you have with your mother.

15
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:09,103
It didn't just happen.
We work at it. We spend time together.

16
00:01:09,447 --> 00:01:13,235
Dad lives with me. How much more
time together could we spend?

17
00:01:13,579 --> 00:01:15,649
Day-to-day living is different.

18
00:01:15,916 --> 00:01:20,194
There is nothing better than taking a trip
together. You get to relax.

19
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:22,858
You get to see a different side of him.

20
00:01:23,137 --> 00:01:26,573
In his entire life,
my dad has never been to europe.

21
00:01:28,061 --> 00:01:31,451
It would be a way of connecting
with him if i gave him that.

22
00:01:31,776 --> 00:01:35,132
What would you charge me
to take him to ireland with you?

23
00:01:38,662 --> 00:01:40,493
 

24
00:01:44,589 --> 00:01:48,138
I should have known this would happen.
I always throw out my back

25
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:50,745
when i try to lift maris's luggage.

26
00:01:51,016 --> 00:01:53,974
- Why didn't you hire a skycap?
- We did for most of it.

27
00:01:54,271 --> 00:01:57,229
She won't trust strangers
with her make-up case,

28
00:01:57,526 --> 00:01:59,482
ever since a porter dropped it

29
00:01:59,739 --> 00:02:03,414
and broke three vials
of rare swiss lamb placenta.

30
00:02:05,331 --> 00:02:09,722
On the up side, the calfskin lining
was never more soft and supple.

31
00:02:12,468 --> 00:02:14,424
Where did mrs crane go?

32
00:02:14,679 --> 00:02:17,068
 

33
00:02:19,438 --> 00:02:22,510
She's making her annual pilgrimage
to the holy land.

34
00:02:22,819 --> 00:02:25,049
Thought she was in dallas,
at her sister's.

35
00:02:25,322 --> 00:02:27,677
That is her holy land.

36
00:02:27,952 --> 00:02:30,261
The site of the first nieman marcus.

37
00:02:32,251 --> 00:02:34,003
 

38
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:37,371
- Oh, dr crane!
- Oh, call me niles!

39
00:02:44,312 --> 00:02:46,780
Thank you, daphne.

40
00:02:47,067 --> 00:02:51,185
Dad, i have a really exciting idea.
I want to take you on vacation!

41
00:02:52,951 --> 00:02:56,182
- Why?
- I thought an adventure

42
00:02:56,499 --> 00:02:58,649
might give us a chance to have fun,

43
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:01,433
get reacquainted,
even do a little bonding.

44
00:03:01,716 --> 00:03:04,674
- What did you have in mind?
- It's not about where i want to go.

45
00:03:04,971 --> 00:03:08,168
It's about where you want to go.

46
00:03:08,477 --> 00:03:11,867
Dad, i give you...
the world.

47
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:17,319
The gallie-pagos islands, huh?

48
00:03:19,704 --> 00:03:24,903
Where iguanas, sea lions and
giant tortoises live in eternal harmony.

49
00:03:25,296 --> 00:03:27,491
Is it important they get along?

50
00:03:28,886 --> 00:03:31,081
No, i suppose not.

51
00:03:31,348 --> 00:03:36,342
Oh, how about this? India and nepal!
"Trek the foothills of the himalayas."

52
00:03:36,732 --> 00:03:38,927
- You're forgetting my old pal.
- No problem.

53
00:03:39,194 --> 00:03:42,311
Frasier can hire a sherpa
to carry you on his back.

54
00:03:43,743 --> 00:03:46,132
They don't mind.

55
00:03:46,414 --> 00:03:49,531
We haven't struck
the right chord yet, but we will.

56
00:03:49,837 --> 00:03:53,716
- You suggest something.
- You really want to go with me?

57
00:03:54,052 --> 00:03:56,407
Yes, i do.
I'll go anywhere you want to!

58
00:03:56,682 --> 00:04:01,517
- Ok!
- I may not be as sophisticated as you,

59
00:04:01,898 --> 00:04:04,014
but i'd like to see america first.

60
00:04:04,278 --> 00:04:06,314
Great! We'll see america!

61
00:04:06,573 --> 00:04:10,009
- And i want to see it in a winnebago.
- A winnebago!

62
00:04:10,329 --> 00:04:16,199
- That has a real ring to it!
- Your mother and i dreamed about it.

63
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:19,464
Then that is the trip we're going to take.

64
00:04:19,761 --> 00:04:21,911
- You really mean it?
- Absolutely.

65
00:04:22,182 --> 00:04:25,857
- This calls for a celebration.
- Let's pop open a couple of beers.

66
00:04:26,189 --> 00:04:29,261
I think i got a bag
of pork rinds in here, too.

67
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:34,438
Ah, the final touch! I almost feel
like i'm in a trailer park already!

68
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:43,523
Oh, winnebago boy!

69
00:04:45,261 --> 00:04:48,458
Hang beach chairs on the back,
and give it a name like

70
00:04:48,768 --> 00:04:51,123
"the whoopin' cranes"!

71
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:55,280
When i agreed
to see america with dad,

72
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:57,561
i thought it'd be five-star resorts.

73
00:04:57,823 --> 00:05:00,542
By "together" i meant adjoining suites!

74
00:05:00,828 --> 00:05:03,103
- Tell him it's a bad idea.
- I can't.

75
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:06,287
He counts on it.
He was going to go with mom.

76
00:05:06,588 --> 00:05:08,783
Yes, but she lucked out and died!

77
00:05:13,767 --> 00:05:15,723
Niles, listen.

78
00:05:15,979 --> 00:05:19,938
If dad and i get into a winnebago,
only one of us will come out alive.

79
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:22,746
- You've got to come too.
- You're my brother.

80
00:05:23,032 --> 00:05:27,184
You're entitled to my bone marrow
and a kidney, but this is an imposition.

81
00:05:28,792 --> 00:05:33,024
You got to come with us.
Frasier and i have nothing to talk about.

82
00:05:33,383 --> 00:05:37,058
I feel more comfortable
with somebody else around.

83
00:05:37,389 --> 00:05:40,699
- Why did you suggest it?
- It sounded good when i said it.

84
00:05:41,021 --> 00:05:44,980
But thinking about it... can you see
me and frasier together all day,

85
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:50,234
then crawling into bunks at night,
lying head to head in the dark, bonding?

86
00:05:51,788 --> 00:05:54,256
I'll pay you. I got pension money.

87
00:05:54,542 --> 00:05:59,332
I remember a car trip when i was nine.
We drove from seattle to spokane.

88
00:05:59,718 --> 00:06:01,470
All he said to me was,

89
00:06:01,721 --> 00:06:05,077
"i think we got a problem
with your brother frasier."

90
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:15,169
Those were awful,
those driving vacations.

91
00:06:15,452 --> 00:06:18,524
Dad insisting on covering
as many miles as possible,

92
00:06:18,832 --> 00:06:22,188
the two of us
tiny hostages in the back seat,

93
00:06:22,505 --> 00:06:24,894
clutching our car-sickness bags,

94
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:28,168
straining to see something
as the landscape whizzed by.

95
00:06:28,473 --> 00:06:31,545
I was 13 before i realised
cows aren't blurry.

96
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:40,389
- Just tell him you don't want to go.
- I don't want to disappoint him.

97
00:06:40,785 --> 00:06:43,253
I don't want to disappoint him.

98
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:46,771
I'm sorry, frasier.
I am not a winnebago person.

99
00:06:47,087 --> 00:06:50,045
When i see one,
i look into the driver's eyes,

100
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:55,212
hoping to see something that explains
why in god's name he wants to do this.

101
00:06:55,602 --> 00:06:59,390
All i see is a death stare
under a hat made of miller lite cans.

102
00:07:01,403 --> 00:07:04,440
This is my final word:
I'm not going.

103
00:07:04,742 --> 00:07:08,621
- Daphne's coming too!
- And so am i!

104
00:07:16,135 --> 00:07:18,524
It's everything i hoped, only better!

105
00:07:18,806 --> 00:07:21,161
It's like sitting in your lounge,
watching tv,

106
00:07:21,436 --> 00:07:23,996
except it isn't tv, it's america!

107
00:07:24,274 --> 00:07:27,789
Yes, dad, it's the ultimate
in reality programming -

108
00:07:28,113 --> 00:07:29,944
actual reality.

109
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,476
We got a turn-off in five miles,
so start slowing down.

110
00:07:33,831 --> 00:07:36,789
- I know.
- How does it feel behind that wheel?

111
00:07:37,963 --> 00:07:39,874
Manly.

112
00:07:40,884 --> 00:07:43,398
This is mine and it's big!

113
00:07:43,681 --> 00:07:45,876
 

114
00:07:46,143 --> 00:07:50,773
God, it's like being sealed upright
in a formica coffin!

115
00:07:51,151 --> 00:07:55,667
When they were kids, all they had
in the back seat was a mayonnaise jar.

116
00:07:57,912 --> 00:07:59,868
Yes. It took quite a bit of skill

117
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:03,754
to use it successfully
at 70 miles an hour.

118
00:08:04,089 --> 00:08:06,683
Never been fond of mayonnaise since.

119
00:08:06,969 --> 00:08:09,119
Or speed bumps.

120
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:12,905
Turn-off's coming up in four miles.
Get ready.

121
00:08:13,229 --> 00:08:16,221
You're ok on the right.
It's never too early to move over.

122
00:08:16,527 --> 00:08:20,156
Dad, i was wondering
what inspired you to choose

123
00:08:20,491 --> 00:08:24,086
that uniquely american
man-made wonder, mount rushmore?

124
00:08:24,415 --> 00:08:26,975
It's obvious. We got a week off, right?

125
00:08:27,252 --> 00:08:29,641
That's as far as we can go in 3½ days.

126
00:08:29,923 --> 00:08:34,394
We get there, get out,
walk around, drive back. Boom!

127
00:08:34,765 --> 00:08:37,882
Another fine landmark under our belts.

128
00:08:38,188 --> 00:08:40,577
You've certainly got this well planned.

129
00:08:40,858 --> 00:08:44,407
When i take a holiday,
i just grab a change of knickers

130
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:47,573
and see where the wind takes me.

131
00:08:48,662 --> 00:08:51,096
Niles.
Niles!

132
00:09:03,562 --> 00:09:07,350
What daphne's saying
is what we should really be doing.

133
00:09:07,695 --> 00:09:12,086
- What are you talking about?
- Why be so beholden to schedules?

134
00:09:12,452 --> 00:09:16,889
We americans are enchanted
with the romance of the open highway.

135
00:09:17,252 --> 00:09:19,288
Jack kerouac went "on the road".

136
00:09:19,547 --> 00:09:21,902
Buzz and todd
got their kicks on route 66.

137
00:09:22,176 --> 00:09:25,452
The adventure is in the journey.
We should just ramble.

138
00:09:25,766 --> 00:09:29,759
Doggone it, i'm inspired!
I'm going to put on a baseball cap.

139
00:09:30,106 --> 00:09:32,574
- You'll miss the turn-off!
- So?

140
00:09:32,861 --> 00:09:35,819
- We'll get lost!
- We're in a house on wheels!

141
00:09:36,116 --> 00:09:39,950
- We're always home!
- It's coming up! Turn here!

142
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:43,566
This is it! Turn! Turn here!

143
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:49,158
- We missed it!
- Dad, we didn't miss anything!

144
00:09:49,555 --> 00:09:51,671
Oh, my god!

145
00:09:55,356 --> 00:09:57,631
We're now on the road less travelled.

146
00:09:57,902 --> 00:10:01,861
From now on,
we dance to the rhythm of the road.

147
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:06,638
There must be an access road
back onto that turn-off.

148
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,355
Where is it? Where is it?

149
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:12,383
Oh, it's always in the crack!

150
00:10:16,099 --> 00:10:18,249
So is life, dad.

151
00:10:21,942 --> 00:10:25,378
I was anxious, but i'm starting
to like this free spirit stuff.

152
00:10:26,699 --> 00:10:30,453
Dad, there's an historical marker
up ahead. Let's stop.

153
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:35,306
- Driving wherever you feel like it.
- It's educational. There! There!

154
00:10:35,673 --> 00:10:37,948
There! There!

155
00:10:38,219 --> 00:10:40,175
- What did it say?
- No idea.

156
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:43,184
The only word i saw was "legendary".

157
00:10:44,479 --> 00:10:48,074
Look, a roadside stand.
Fresh fruit, home-made cider!

158
00:10:48,402 --> 00:10:52,520
- dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad!
- Oh!

159
00:10:52,868 --> 00:10:56,543
You're missing
the freewheeling concept.

160
00:10:58,627 --> 00:11:01,425
We go where the wind blows us.

161
00:11:01,716 --> 00:11:05,152
It's blowing, we're going.
Why are you moaning?

162
00:11:05,472 --> 00:11:08,191
You're obsessed
with covering distance.

163
00:11:08,727 --> 00:11:12,766
- It's the way i relax.
Hey, watch it! I got my kids in the car!

164
00:11:13,819 --> 00:11:15,775
Whoa!

165
00:11:19,119 --> 00:11:22,236
Your "relaxing"
seems like an obsession.

166
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:26,136
Don't you think so, niles?
Niles, what are you doing?

167
00:11:26,465 --> 00:11:31,220
Making a vacation video we can look at
over and over and over again.

168
00:11:31,723 --> 00:11:35,921
Ok. You guys want to stop so bad,
we'll stop. See that sign?

169
00:11:36,272 --> 00:11:40,265
"Have your picture taken
with a live grizzly. Souvenirs one mile."

170
00:11:40,613 --> 00:11:43,252
I always wanted
my picture taken with a bear.

171
00:11:43,535 --> 00:11:45,651
Some dreams cannot be denied.

172
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:50,942
Ok, dad, you're good on my side.
It's never too early to change lane.

173
00:11:51,339 --> 00:11:54,251
Oh, my god! It must be genetic.

174
00:12:03,693 --> 00:12:06,969
Get your dog away from my bear.
I just had him cleaned.

175
00:12:07,282 --> 00:12:09,238
He's stuffed.

176
00:12:09,494 --> 00:12:13,646
- Your sign said a "live" bear.
- It's an old sign.

177
00:12:15,671 --> 00:12:18,185
Look at that view!
It's like we're really there!

178
00:12:18,467 --> 00:12:22,346
If we were,
we'd be whizzing by it at 50 mph.

179
00:12:22,682 --> 00:12:24,877
It's the gourmet food department.

180
00:12:25,145 --> 00:12:28,501
- Home-made deer jerky!
- "No sampling."

181
00:12:28,817 --> 00:12:33,208
- No problem.
- Would you take our picture, please?

182
00:12:33,576 --> 00:12:38,445
Niles, frasier, come on up here.
Ok. Here we go. Everybody ready?

183
00:12:38,834 --> 00:12:41,792
- Now, what should we do?
- How about this?

184
00:12:42,089 --> 00:12:44,319
That's great! I like that. Ok, everybody.

185
00:12:44,594 --> 00:12:47,904
- Eddie!
- You know it's $10 canadian.

186
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:50,864
- For a treasured memory,
what's money?

187
00:12:51,146 --> 00:12:53,216
- Ok. One...
- why canadian dollars?

188
00:12:53,483 --> 00:12:55,758
Because we're in canada.

189
00:12:56,071 --> 00:12:57,629
 

190
00:12:58,867 --> 00:13:00,823
We're in canada?

191
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:04,469
We crossed the border a while ago.
You were taking a nap.

192
00:13:04,794 --> 00:13:08,548
But i can't be in canada!
I'm not allowed to leave the states.

193
00:13:08,883 --> 00:13:12,080
- Why?
- I don't have me green card yet!

194
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:17,180
Oh, this is just perfect!
Three months till me final interview.

195
00:13:17,565 --> 00:13:21,478
The one thing they told me
was not to leave the country.

196
00:13:21,822 --> 00:13:26,134
And the first time i fall asleep,
you drag me across the border!

197
00:13:26,496 --> 00:13:30,091
- They won't let me back in!
- They have to. It's not your fault.

198
00:13:30,419 --> 00:13:33,491
If only you hadn't been
so hell-bent on driving far!

199
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,030
You had to go where the wind blows!

200
00:13:36,304 --> 00:13:38,260
 

201
00:13:42,063 --> 00:13:44,338
 

202
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:48,842
Never mind whose fault it is.
I'm stuck here. What am i going to do?

203
00:13:49,201 --> 00:13:52,876
We'll explain to the authorities.
I'm sure this happens all the time.

204
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:56,279
- Get real. They got rules.
- Then what's your solution?

205
00:13:56,587 --> 00:13:59,784
- We'll sneak her across the border.
- That's called smuggling.

206
00:14:00,093 --> 00:14:02,084
Thanks, niles!

207
00:14:02,347 --> 00:14:06,226
I knew it was something bad guys did.
I didn't know the technical term.

208
00:14:06,562 --> 00:14:10,191
You, a former policeman,
suggest we commit a felony?

209
00:14:10,526 --> 00:14:12,596
I've crossed this border plenty.

210
00:14:12,864 --> 00:14:16,823
Most of the time
the guards wave you through.

211
00:14:17,163 --> 00:14:19,802
- Let's get out of here.
- What if they pull us over?

212
00:14:20,085 --> 00:14:23,157
Daphne has to convince them
she's american.

213
00:14:23,465 --> 00:14:26,855
It beats having me bum bounced back
across the pond.

214
00:14:27,179 --> 00:14:31,218
- Let's give it a bash.
- Oh, yes, this is foolproof!

215
00:14:35,569 --> 00:14:38,527
i'm about to defraud
the us immigration department.

216
00:14:38,824 --> 00:14:40,701
So is my father, my older brother.

217
00:14:40,952 --> 00:14:45,901
People who should be my role models.
I'm the product of a bad environment.

218
00:14:46,295 --> 00:14:50,493
If the guard asks you a question
can you say anything -

219
00:14:50,844 --> 00:14:52,960
- in an american accent?
- sure.

220
00:14:53,222 --> 00:14:55,099
- Ok, what?
- You heard it.

221
00:14:55,351 --> 00:14:57,387
- What?
- Sure.

222
00:14:58,982 --> 00:15:02,577
That's all i can say.
I need a cup of tea.

223
00:15:02,905 --> 00:15:08,662
Tea? Why not wave a crumpet in the air
and sing "god save the queen"?

224
00:15:10,459 --> 00:15:14,737
You're a psychiatrist. You should
be in control of your emotions.

225
00:15:15,091 --> 00:15:17,605
Oh, my god, there's the border!

226
00:15:17,888 --> 00:15:21,198
All right.
Now calm down. We're gonna be fine.

227
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,909
Remember, they'll be looking
for suspicious behaviour.

228
00:15:25,233 --> 00:15:27,667
Niles, that qualifies.

229
00:15:27,947 --> 00:15:31,906
If the guard pokes his head in here,
what will he see?

230
00:15:32,245 --> 00:15:35,794
Four carefree americans.

231
00:15:36,126 --> 00:15:39,755
- I've never been so nervous.
- There isn't any need to be.

232
00:15:40,092 --> 00:15:43,004
They're waving everybody through
without any questions!

233
00:15:43,305 --> 00:15:45,102
Please, please!

234
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:48,706
They're waving us through.
They're waving us through!

235
00:15:49,022 --> 00:15:51,092
They're pulling us over!

236
00:15:52,027 --> 00:15:54,336
They're pulling us over!

237
00:15:58,162 --> 00:16:00,312
the guard.
i can't do this.

238
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:03,620
It's going to be fine.
Just keep your answers short.

239
00:16:03,922 --> 00:16:06,436
Guilty people always talk too much.

240
00:16:07,637 --> 00:16:11,152
- Hi, folks. Enjoyed canada?
- great!

241
00:16:11,476 --> 00:16:13,990
What was the purpose of your trip?

242
00:16:16,318 --> 00:16:18,274
Fun.

243
00:16:23,413 --> 00:16:25,369
I see.

244
00:16:25,624 --> 00:16:28,092
- Where were you born?
- Seattle, washington.

245
00:16:28,379 --> 00:16:31,496
You want to know what country.
America, of course!

246
00:16:31,801 --> 00:16:35,635
I'm quite an american. I always vote
for the law and order guy...

247
00:16:35,975 --> 00:16:38,364
that's fine, i don't need any more detail.

248
00:16:38,647 --> 00:16:40,922
And you, miss?

249
00:16:41,192 --> 00:16:43,148
Enjoy canada?

250
00:16:43,404 --> 00:16:45,520
Sure.

251
00:16:45,783 --> 00:16:48,092
And the weather?

252
00:16:48,371 --> 00:16:50,202
Sure.
Sure.

253
00:16:52,961 --> 00:16:57,079
- Is this your vehicle?
- No. Yes, well, i rented it.

254
00:16:57,427 --> 00:17:01,056
It's american-made.
I always look for that union label.

255
00:17:01,392 --> 00:17:04,828
- I need your licence and registration.
- It's right here.

256
00:17:05,148 --> 00:17:09,585
The registration... let me get
my licence out for you. Here we are.

257
00:17:12,536 --> 00:17:15,209
Stay right here.

258
00:17:15,499 --> 00:17:19,777
Well, i certainly can
depend on my gang, can't i?

259
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:27,035
- I'm going to be arrested!
- We're all getting arrested.

260
00:17:27,351 --> 00:17:30,900
But i have delicate features.
Prison will be hell for me.

261
00:17:32,569 --> 00:17:34,878
Cool it, niles.

262
00:17:35,156 --> 00:17:38,671
It's too late to turn back.
I say we make a run for it.

263
00:17:38,996 --> 00:17:43,353
Oh, great idea! A high-speed chase
in an eight-ton motor home!

264
00:17:43,712 --> 00:17:47,148
An amusing anecdote
for the border guard newsletter.

265
00:17:47,468 --> 00:17:51,302
Shut up. Keep babbling like this,
they'll catch us for sure.

266
00:17:51,641 --> 00:17:53,632
He's coming back.

267
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:56,686
Well, these check out.

268
00:17:56,942 --> 00:18:00,981
We're all strictly on the up and up.

269
00:18:01,324 --> 00:18:06,159
Miss, you've been very quiet.
Is there something i should know here?

270
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:09,499
You seem awfully nervous.

271
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:12,391
May i have your name, please?

272
00:18:15,848 --> 00:18:20,126
Aw, all right. I should have
known better than to try this.

273
00:18:20,481 --> 00:18:24,918
- It was wrong!
- Just back off. What is it, sir?

274
00:18:26,157 --> 00:18:30,628
We were trying to put one over on you.
Eddie!

275
00:18:32,751 --> 00:18:37,700
- We don't have a rabies certificate.
- I knew something was going on here.

276
00:18:38,093 --> 00:18:42,291
We weren't planning on coming,
and at the border, we forgot.

277
00:18:42,642 --> 00:18:44,792
I didn't know you needed one.

278
00:18:45,063 --> 00:18:47,657
But ignorance of the law is no defence,

279
00:18:47,943 --> 00:18:50,411
so take the little dog away
and we'll be off.

280
00:18:54,996 --> 00:18:59,228
If you're worried,
we picked the dog up here in canada.

281
00:18:59,587 --> 00:19:02,101
I got a picture i can show you.

282
00:19:02,383 --> 00:19:06,342
Here's a picture of him
taken at the seattle space needle.

283
00:19:07,224 --> 00:19:10,739
- I see you got a badge there.
- Oh, yeah!

284
00:19:12,525 --> 00:19:14,800
- Are you a policeman?
- Retired.

285
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:18,107
Thirty years on the force.
I should know better.

286
00:19:18,409 --> 00:19:20,047
- Absolutely.
- Definitely.

287
00:19:20,288 --> 00:19:21,926
Sure.

288
00:19:27,132 --> 00:19:30,090
Next time, remember
the rabies certificate. Have a safe trip.

289
00:19:30,387 --> 00:19:33,663
- Thanks, officer.
- Thank you.

290
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:37,811
Drive!

291
00:19:42,741 --> 00:19:44,652
 

292
00:19:44,912 --> 00:19:47,745
Oh,
they'd have returned you eventually!

293
00:19:51,339 --> 00:19:53,648
- How long till we get home?
- Two hours.

294
00:19:53,927 --> 00:19:56,441
This highway goes right into seattle.

295
00:19:56,722 --> 00:20:00,510
- Why don't you take a nap?
- Oh, no, i'm ok.

296
00:20:00,855 --> 00:20:05,246
- Thought maybe we'd chat a little.
- Oh, yeah, great.

297
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:20,976
I can't help it. When we're alone,
i don't know what to say.

298
00:20:22,182 --> 00:20:24,821
That's why i asked daphne to come.

299
00:20:25,103 --> 00:20:28,493
I had my suspicions,
but i'd hoped that wasn't the case.

300
00:20:28,817 --> 00:20:31,490
Knock it off.
That's why you asked niles.

301
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:35,739
That's why i asked him,
but that's not why he came.

302
00:20:37,373 --> 00:20:42,163
Well, the funny thing is
we didn't have such a bad time, did we?

303
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:47,858
"I see you got a badge there."
"Oh, yeah!"

304
00:20:50,854 --> 00:20:53,652
- Pretty slick, huh?
- Yeah.

305
00:21:00,245 --> 00:21:03,043
There's no reason to cut our trip short.

306
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:05,893
We're not that far from yellowstone.

307
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:09,924
- I always wanted to see old faithful.
- Me, too.

308
00:21:10,261 --> 00:21:15,654
If you want a real adventure,
we could drop these two off home first.

309
00:21:16,062 --> 00:21:19,259
- Just the two of us, alone?
- Yeah!

310
00:21:19,568 --> 00:21:22,366
- Just you and me, father and son?
- Yeah.

311
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:25,648
Yeah, you and me,
camping in yellowstone, all alone.

312
00:21:25,953 --> 00:21:27,989
All by ourselves!

313
00:21:36,512 --> 00:21:41,267
Well, it'd be a shame if daphne
didn't get to see those indian paint pots.

314
00:21:41,646 --> 00:21:45,355
- Of course.
- They are a real miracle of nature.

315
00:21:45,694 --> 00:21:48,970
- Yeah, yeah.
- Wouldn't be fair to leave niles alone.

316
00:21:49,283 --> 00:21:53,515
- Maris out of town, that'd be cruel.
- Yeah, absolutely.

317
00:21:53,874 --> 00:21:57,503
- How far is it to yellowstone?
- We'll be there tomorrow.

318
00:21:57,839 --> 00:22:01,309
It'd be a nice surprise
for those two when they wake up.

319
00:22:01,638 --> 00:22:05,392
I got a better surprise.
Let's tell daphne we're in mexico!

320
00:22:12,447 --> 00:22:16,520
# Hey, baby, i hear the blues a-calling
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

321
00:22:18,289 --> 00:22:19,358
# mercy

322
00:22:19,583 --> 00:22:25,260
# and maybe i seem a bit confused
well, maybe... but i got you pegged!

323
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:30,437
# But i don't know what to do with those
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

324
00:22:32,647 --> 00:22:34,922
# they're calling again

325
00:22:35,401 --> 00:22:37,039
good night, seattle, we love you.
