1
00:00:08,295 --> 00:00:11,988
Hello Doug, this is Dr. Frasier Crane. 
I'm listening.

2
00:00:11,989 --> 00:00:13,403
Yeah, it's about my mother.

3
00:00:13,404 --> 00:00:16,111
She's getting on now and she doesn't have much of a life.

4
00:00:16,112 --> 00:00:22,098
And... I mean, she doesn't want to do anything 
or go anywhere and she literally hangs around the house all day.

5
00:00:22,099 --> 00:00:24,149
I mean, it's very frustrating...

6
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,456
I'm sorry, can we just go back a second?

7
00:00:26,457 --> 00:00:29,692
You said you mother literally hangs around the house.

8
00:00:29,693 --> 00:00:36,470
Well, I suppose it's a pet peeve of mine 
but what you mean to say is that 
she figuratively "hangs around" the house.

9
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:40,239
To... to literally hang around the house 
you'd have to be a bat or spider monkey.

10
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:43,674
Now, back to your problem?

11
00:00:43,675 --> 00:00:46,139
Do you mind if we stop while I tell you my pet peeve?

12
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:47,156
Not a all.

13
00:00:47,157 --> 00:00:52,309
I hate it when intellectual pinheads 
with superiority complexes...

14
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:55,209
...nit-pick your grammar when they come to you for help.

15
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:57,233
That's what I got a problem with!

16
00:01:00,563 --> 00:01:05,756
I think what he means is, 
that is a thing with which he has a problem.

17
00:01:09,708 --> 00:01:14,280
Now it's time for a station break 
and we'll be right back after a word from our friends at

18
00:01:14,281 --> 00:01:15,372
"Pizza, Pizza, Pizza."

19
00:01:17,523 --> 00:01:19,761
Hey, do you want to know my pet peeve?

20
00:01:19,762 --> 00:01:24,555
It's when you're in a department store and the clerk 
is right in the middle of helping you and the phone rings.

21
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:26,859
So he starts taking care of them.

22
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:28,389
And you're left standing there going...

23
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:32,260
"Excuse me, but all I did was come 
all the way down here in person...

24
00:01:32,261 --> 00:01:35,368
...whilst some joker is sitting at home 
in his underwear getting first rate service!"

25
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:36,711
Don't you hate that?

26
00:01:37,045 --> 00:01:38,979
Actually, I do most of my shopping by phone.

27
00:01:40,877 --> 00:01:44,470
You know Roz, this conversation with Doug 
has got me thinking about my father.

28
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:51,780
He doesn't do much of anything either. 
He just sits around most of the time watching TV 
and doing the occasional crossword puzzle.

29
00:01:52,243 --> 00:01:54,107
What does your mother do?

30
00:01:54,909 --> 00:01:56,696
She's the attorney general of Wisconsin.

31
00:01:57,735 --> 00:02:00,465
- No, really!
- Really!

32
00:02:03,897 --> 00:02:06,080
Well, I guess that helps fill her day.

33
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:10,232
Yeah, quote mom, "Crime never stops - 
even in the dairy state!"

34
00:02:11,703 --> 00:02:18,837
Well, I don't think public office is for dad, 
but maybe I could find him a hobby or something. Any suggestions?

35
00:02:18,838 --> 00:02:22,390
Well, in her spare time my mom likes to water ski a little.

36
00:02:22,391 --> 00:02:27,678
She hikes, oil paints... oh, she likes archaeology. 
She's on a dig in Honduras right now.

37
00:02:29,913 --> 00:02:32,216
Yeah, maybe I could get him a wood burning set.

38
00:02:36,429 --> 00:02:37,881
Is dad still asleep?

39
00:02:38,424 --> 00:02:44,563
Yes, he's napping with the dog. Eddie's little legs are going like mad. 
I think he's dreaming about chasing rabbits.

40
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:46,708
I can't explain your father's twitching!

41
00:02:49,692 --> 00:02:50,959
Well, I'm just about done with this thing.

42
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:52,671
I think your dad's going to love it.

43
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:53,468
Yeah, Me, too.

44
00:02:53,469 --> 00:02:58,250
I was walking through the hobby shop and saw this 
thing and it was like, "Eureka!" I said to myself... 
I actually said "Eureka!"

45
00:03:01,137 --> 00:03:06,099
Ah, yes. There are a million stories in the naked city.

46
00:03:06,851 --> 00:03:09,352
Now if we could just find a naked one.

47
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:14,370
Dr. Crane, you naughty boy.

48
00:03:14,371 --> 00:03:16,606
Peeking in on other people's privacy.

49
00:03:16,607 --> 00:03:17,997
Oh Daphne, really.

50
00:03:18,297 --> 00:03:20,613
I mean, if people were so concerned about
their precious privacy...

51
00:03:20,614 --> 00:03:23,553
they wouldn't leave their blinds open at that certain angle...

52
00:03:23,554 --> 00:03:27,416
where you can see the mirror over the mantle 
that reflects down the hall to the water bed in the back room!

53
00:03:29,456 --> 00:03:33,405
I think I hear your father coming. 
Stand in front of it, we'll make this a little surprise.

54
00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:37,231
- Hi, guys.
- Dad.
- How was your nap?

55
00:03:37,232 --> 00:03:39,417
Great, I had the strangest dream.

56
00:03:39,841 --> 00:03:43,301
I dreamt this beautiful woman with bad 
breath was licking my face.

57
00:03:47,366 --> 00:03:49,241
Hey, where did you just come from?

58
00:03:51,757 --> 00:03:53,215
Dad, I got a surprise for you.

59
00:03:54,436 --> 00:03:58,891
Hey, telescope, it's... it's a beaut. 
What's the occasion?

60
00:03:58,892 --> 00:04:00,386
Oh, no occasion, just thought you'd like it.

61
00:04:00,387 --> 00:04:02,469
Wow, that's great, thanks.

62
00:04:03,186 --> 00:04:08,021
You know, I saw in the news there's a bunch 
of falcons nesting in the eaves of the Columbia Tower.

63
00:04:08,022 --> 00:04:09,389
Maybe I can watch them from here.

64
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:10,916
Dad, dad, forget the falcons.

65
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:13,937
You can see what is going on in that 
apartment building over there.

66
00:04:14,498 --> 00:04:16,965
Hey, I've locked people up for that kind of behavior.

67
00:04:16,966 --> 00:04:20,793
Oh come on, it's perfectly innocent - 
just think of it as having like a... 
a hundred more channels to watch.

68
00:04:22,517 --> 00:04:26,304
Just look at them, people going about their lives.

69
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:33,114
There's an old couple watching the telly, 
and just next door an attractive young woman is working at a computer...

70
00:04:33,115 --> 00:04:38,543
while below her a burly man is using a beach 
towel to sop up a large pool of blood.

71
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:40,366
- Oh my God.
- What?

72
00:04:41,433 --> 00:04:42,297
Daddy!

73
00:04:44,185 --> 00:04:47,312
No, that's tomato juice - you can see the can on the counter.

74
00:04:48,142 --> 00:04:51,221
You’re right about that woman at the 
computer though, she's a looker.

75
00:04:51,641 --> 00:04:53,825
Ah, you see, there's a boy in all of us.

76
00:04:54,597 --> 00:04:58,708
Well, let's see what else the Seattle skyline has to offer.

77
00:04:59,097 --> 00:05:00,784
I say we make a strict rule, though:

78
00:05:00,785 --> 00:05:04,264
if anybody starts doing anything nasty we move on. Agreed?

79
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,452
I said, agreed?

80
00:05:09,616 --> 00:05:10,930
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

81
00:05:12,023 --> 00:05:16,263
Well, there's a lady over there with a telescope. 
She's looking back at us.

82
00:05:16,264 --> 00:05:18,243
What... What... What shall we do?

83
00:05:18,244 --> 00:05:19,435
Hide!

84
00:05:21,281 --> 00:05:23,891
I knew it, I knew it, every time we do 
something bad I get caught!

85
00:05:26,066 --> 00:05:28,192
Hi, how are you doing?

86
00:05:30,192 --> 00:05:31,175
What are you doing?

87
00:05:31,176 --> 00:05:32,943
She's waving at us, I'm waving back.

88
00:05:32,944 --> 00:05:34,894
- Don't do that!
- Why not?

89
00:05:34,895 --> 00:05:38,449
Hey wait, she's writing something down. 
She's holding it up.

90
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:41,843
It says, "Hello there, stranger".

91
00:05:41,844 --> 00:05:44,090
Hey Daphne, quick, get me that pad and pen.

92
00:05:44,091 --> 00:05:45,087
Wait, wait, wait. What for?

93
00:05:45,088 --> 00:05:49,006
I'm... I'm gonna answer. 
Write down "My name is Martin."

94
00:05:49,007 --> 00:05:50,792
Dad, dad you shouldn't encourage this person.

95
00:05:50,793 --> 00:05:55,708
I don't really want people looking in on our lives. 
I don't think I've made my bed today.

96
00:05:56,957 --> 00:05:58,503
Is she writing anything else?

97
00:05:59,637 --> 00:06:02,723
Yeah. "My name is Irene." Her name's Irene.

98
00:06:02,724 --> 00:06:04,099
- Her name's Irene.
- Thank you.

99
00:06:05,229 --> 00:06:06,526
Wait, she's writing something else.

100
00:06:07,163 --> 00:06:11,344
“Is that Dr. Crane from the radio hiding in the back?”

101
00:06:12,757 --> 00:06:15,040
It does not say that!

102
00:06:16,608 --> 00:06:17,736
It does say that.

103
00:06:21,457 --> 00:06:22,359
Hello.

104
00:06:24,983 --> 00:06:27,475
”Her older son's an accountant in Falkland.”

105
00:06:27,476 --> 00:06:29,364
He was the breech birth, right?

106
00:06:29,365 --> 00:06:31,660
No, that's the Dennis in Boise.

107
00:06:32,229 --> 00:06:36,367
Oh right, he's the one with the wife 
that won't let him visit. I can't stand her.

108
00:06:37,946 --> 00:06:39,802
Morning dad, Daphne.

109
00:06:39,803 --> 00:06:41,264
Morning, Irene.

110
00:06:42,586 --> 00:06:46,864
Hey Frasier, when you were a kid, what was the name 
of that skin condition you had on your butt?

111
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,804
It's Pityorisis Rosea.

112
00:06:50,805 --> 00:06:52,363
- How do you spell that?
- Why?

113
00:06:52,364 --> 00:06:54,864
Irene and I are exchanging family histories.

114
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:58,467
Dad. I really don't think your girlfriend 
needs to know about that.

115
00:06:58,468 --> 00:06:59,960
She's not my girlfriend!

116
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:01,219
Oh, come on.

117
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,467
You two have been exchanging notes 
now for the past three days.

118
00:07:03,468 --> 00:07:08,193
If you were in the sixth grade you would be
sitting in a tree "K-I-S-S-I-N-G".

119
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:12,092
Here Daphne, let me borrow that pen.

120
00:07:12,093 --> 00:07:13,065
What are you doing?

121
00:07:13,066 --> 00:07:17,139
I'm going to help along your little 
romance and possibly save a small forest.

122
00:07:19,649 --> 00:07:21,378
I'm giving her our telephone number.

123
00:07:21,379 --> 00:07:23,550
- No, no, no, no, no, don't do that!
- Why?

124
00:07:23,976 --> 00:07:26,053
Well, she'll think I'm being too forward.

125
00:07:26,495 --> 00:07:28,875
For God's sake, dad, you met peeping into her apartment.

126
00:07:30,129 --> 00:07:31,742
- She's not going to call.
- You want to bet?

127
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:33,298
- Yeah, five bucks.
- Okay.

128
00:07:36,918 --> 00:07:38,228
- Well, are you going to answer?
- You get it

129
00:07:38,899 --> 00:07:40,707
Dad, it's for you!

130
00:07:46,747 --> 00:07:50,772
Hello. No, no, this is Frasier. Hi. I'm fine.

131
00:07:52,034 --> 00:07:55,795
Well, it gets a little flaky when the weather's dry.

132
00:08:00,211 --> 00:08:01,261
Tell her I'm not home.

133
00:08:01,262 --> 00:08:04,822
Dad, she knows you're home - 
she's looking at you through the telescope.

134
00:08:04,823 --> 00:08:07,051
Come on, you're just a little nervous.

135
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:10,389
Hello?

136
00:08:11,869 --> 00:08:12,916
Hi.

137
00:08:14,295 --> 00:08:16,260
Yeah, it's nice hearing yours.

138
00:08:19,354 --> 00:08:20,482
Can you hold on a minute?

139
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:22,724
Would you two get out of here?

140
00:08:27,233 --> 00:08:30,144
- I'm getting a very good feeling about this.
- Really?

141
00:08:30,144 --> 00:08:32,458
Hold it. You really think he's interested in her?

142
00:08:32,459 --> 00:08:33,585
Yes, I think so.

143
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:38,135
Do you want to hear something cute, Dr. Crane?

144
00:08:38,136 --> 00:08:43,433
I made him this rich gooey coffee cake this morning, 
because you know what a sweet tooth he has.

145
00:08:43,434 --> 00:08:49,839
And he wouldn't even take one bite because - 
as he put it - "Women don't like a spare tire on a man."

146
00:08:51,463 --> 00:08:56,488
That's so cute. Oh, it's funny, you know - 
the twists and turns of fate.

147
00:08:57,087 --> 00:09:00,339
If I had tried to set dad up with a woman 
he would have rejected the idea out of hand...

148
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:06,403
but I go out get him this telescope for a hobby 
and it kindles this romance. It's Kismet!

149
00:09:17,173 --> 00:09:20,647
- Well?
- What?
- What happened?

150
00:09:20,648 --> 00:09:21,923
We talked on the phone.

151
00:09:21,924 --> 00:09:26,058
And? Was she nice, was she interesting? What did she say?

152
00:09:26,059 --> 00:09:27,881
She said a lot of stuff.

153
00:09:27,882 --> 00:09:31,334
So it would be safe to assume that 
you two will be seeing each other?

154
00:09:31,335 --> 00:09:33,144
Ah, she wanted to, but I said no.

155
00:09:33,495 --> 00:09:34,806
No? Why?

156
00:09:34,807 --> 00:09:36,122
She's not my type.

157
00:09:37,923 --> 00:09:41,678
Oh, coffee cake! We got any butter round here?

158
00:09:47,111 --> 00:09:51,092
You know Brewster Cale? The pompous twit 
who is the president of our wine club?

159
00:09:51,093 --> 00:09:56,592
Well, at our meeting the other night I convinced 
some of my fellow psychiatrists to play a little prank on him.

160
00:09:56,593 --> 00:10:01,615
When he thought he was tasting the Chateau Petrus, 
he was in fact sipping a Forcas Dupres.

161
00:10:03,574 --> 00:10:05,659
You see, we switched the labels.

162
00:10:07,086 --> 00:10:09,118
What scamps you are!

163
00:10:11,567 --> 00:10:16,755
There he was, proclaiming the Petrus to be the 
superior wine and of course none of us could contain our laughter.

164
00:10:16,756 --> 00:10:20,202
His face must have turned redder than a "Piechoné Logeavie".

165
00:10:22,392 --> 00:10:25,918
Well of course, as so often happens, 
rough house turns to tears.

166
00:10:31,266 --> 00:10:34,930
At the end of the evening, Brewster tended his resignation.

167
00:10:35,378 --> 00:10:37,265
That must have put a damper on the evening.

168
00:10:37,266 --> 00:10:38,924
Well, not really. I'm the new president.

169
00:10:40,724 --> 00:10:41,849
Kudos indeed.

170
00:10:43,629 --> 00:10:48,780
Oh, oh, oh, is our dad and his lady friend still 
playing telescope footsy? What was her name?

171
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:52,123
Irene. No, they've broken it off.

172
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:55,389
Already? I thought it was going so well.

173
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:59,603
Well it was, but then they spoke once and dad 
said that she wasn't his type.

174
00:10:59,603 --> 00:11:00,916
So, it's over - it's done!

175
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,396
He's completely cut her out of his life.

176
00:11:03,397 --> 00:11:05,966
I just don't understand what would make him do that.

177
00:11:05,967 --> 00:11:07,777
Oh, who knows why anybody does anything?

178
00:11:08,453 --> 00:11:10,268
Remind me again what you do for a living?

179
00:11:12,309 --> 00:11:14,500
You see the thing is, it was just one phone call.

180
00:11:14,501 --> 00:11:18,800
I mean. How can anyone make a sound judgment about 
another person on the basis of one phone call?

181
00:11:19,364 --> 00:11:21,709
Remind me again what it is YOU do for a living?

182
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:29,696
Well anyway, I suppose it could be any number of 
reasons. Fear of rejection, shyness...

183
00:11:29,697 --> 00:11:32,386
Or maybe dad was telling the truth and 
he just wasn't her type.

184
00:11:33,049 --> 00:11:34,720
If only we knew someone who was...

185
00:11:34,721 --> 00:11:39,433
I know! Maris's lovely Aunt Patrice is in town 
visiting from Washington, D.C.

186
00:11:39,434 --> 00:11:41,861
Oh, oh, oh, maybe we should set dad up with her.

187
00:11:41,862 --> 00:11:45,446
No, Niles, I've met Aunt Patrice. 
The woman is a loon.

188
00:11:46,646 --> 00:11:48,083
Frasier, do this for me.

189
00:11:48,084 --> 00:11:51,322
Every time Aunt Patrice comes to visit, 
Maris makes all these plans

190
00:11:51,323 --> 00:11:56,654
then she dives under the duvet with a two-week migraine 
and I'm left holding the bag - literally and figuratively.

191
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:00,007
Oh, I don't think so, Niles.

192
00:12:00,008 --> 00:12:02,626
I know dad, don't meddle.

193
00:12:02,627 --> 00:12:03,541
Alright,

194
00:12:04,352 --> 00:12:06,091
the least you could do is say hello to Aunt Patrice.

195
00:12:06,092 --> 00:12:07,480
I'm not driving out to your house.

196
00:12:07,481 --> 00:12:09,028
You don't have to. She's sitting out in the car.

197
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,741
You left her in the car?!

198
00:12:12,979 --> 00:12:14,088
I cracked open a window.

199
00:12:14,089 --> 00:12:15,395
Well, then she's fine.

200
00:12:18,953 --> 00:12:22,191
No, no, no. Calm down son, listen to daddy.

201
00:12:23,107 --> 00:12:28,582
It's just a bad dream. I promise you, 
Senator Thurmond is not in your closet.

202
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:35,817
That's a good boy. Yes, okay you go back to bed now.

203
00:12:35,818 --> 00:12:41,537
I love you too. Listen, I'll see you next 
weekend. Okay, bye bye.

204
00:12:42,706 --> 00:12:43,592
How's Freddie?

205
00:12:44,101 --> 00:12:46,911
Oh, Frederick is fine. Oh, he sends his love.

206
00:12:47,406 --> 00:12:49,035
He said to thank you for the toy gun you gave him.

207
00:12:49,036 --> 00:12:52,796
At least what he can remember of it before 
Lilith smashed it to bits with a croquet mallet.

208
00:12:53,768 --> 00:12:56,776
Oh it's such a beautiful night.

209
00:12:56,777 --> 00:12:59,061
The city is lit up like a jewel.

210
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,526
Oh look, there's Irene.

211
00:13:01,837 --> 00:13:08,933
She's sitting in her window wearing a stunning 
green dress. But her face, it's so sad.

212
00:13:13,105 --> 00:13:14,922
Oh, oh, she's holding a note.

213
00:13:16,158 --> 00:13:19,392
It says, "Martin, was it something I wrote?"

214
00:13:20,982 --> 00:13:24,248
Will you cut it out? Irene is not 
sitting in her window.

215
00:13:24,249 --> 00:13:27,241
Oh alright dad, no she isn't, but she 
might as well be, for god’s sakes.

216
00:13:27,242 --> 00:13:28,492
That's gotta be what she's thinking!

217
00:13:28,493 --> 00:13:30,920
Haven't you ever met a woman and then 
decide she's not the one?

218
00:13:30,921 --> 00:13:33,421
Yes, five years after I married her.

219
00:13:35,128 --> 00:13:36,312
Hello there, Frasier.

220
00:13:36,313 --> 00:13:39,353
Niles - I was specifically not expecting you.

221
00:13:41,474 --> 00:13:43,403
Frasier, you remember Aunt Patrice.

222
00:13:43,404 --> 00:13:44,870
Well, of course. Aunt Patrice, yes.

223
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:50,392
I don't recall really when we met but 
I believe there was a lot of laughing and dancing.

224
00:13:50,393 --> 00:13:51,834
My husband's funeral.

225
00:13:51,835 --> 00:13:57,289
Yes... well, of course, the laughter was to hide our tears.

226
00:13:58,039 --> 00:13:59,494
- Let me take your wrap.
- Thank you.

227
00:13:59,495 --> 00:14:01,465
We were taking a drive and I thought,

228
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:04,547
"Why, we are just a couple of short ferry 
rides from Frasier's," so...

229
00:14:07,328 --> 00:14:08,806
we decided to pop over.

230
00:14:08,807 --> 00:14:13,082
Niles, is this the charming gentleman 
you were telling me about?

231
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:15,620
Oh, Patrice, you bloodhound. 
You've treed another one!

232
00:14:17,268 --> 00:14:19,178
Yes, this is my dad.

233
00:14:19,179 --> 00:14:22,862
- How do you do, Patrice, I'm Martin Crane. 
This is Daphne Moon.
- How do you do

234
00:14:22,863 --> 00:14:24,286
- How do you do
- Nice to meet you.

235
00:14:24,287 --> 00:14:25,801
- Please.
- Thank you!

236
00:14:25,802 --> 00:14:27,848
So, what brings you to Seattle?

237
00:14:27,849 --> 00:14:30,698
Well, I came to see Maris, 
but the poor thing's taken to her bed again.

238
00:14:30,699 --> 00:14:32,858
To this day I have no idea how tall she is.

239
00:14:35,475 --> 00:14:39,972
Yes, so I've had Patrice all to myself 
and we've had a great time, haven't we?

240
00:14:39,973 --> 00:14:46,584
Well, if you call sitting in your waiting room 
for four hours reading old magazines a great time, 
well then yes - we had a laugh riot.

241
00:14:48,188 --> 00:14:50,181
Now I know where Maris has he sense of humour.

242
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:56,427
Why don't I pop into the kitchen and gets 
us all some refreshments?

243
00:14:56,428 --> 00:14:59,528
A capital idea, and why don't Frasier 
and I join you?

244
00:14:59,529 --> 00:15:01,967
That'll give these kids some time 
to get to know one another.

245
00:15:03,137 --> 00:15:05,254
Niles, I distinctly told you not to bring her here.

246
00:15:05,603 --> 00:15:06,900
I ran out of ways to entertain her.

247
00:15:07,224 --> 00:15:11,958
We went to the arboretum, a fashion show, 
a matinée of "La Cage Aux Folles" and we even spat 
off the top of the Space Needle.

248
00:15:11,959 --> 00:15:13,392
I'm sorry, I cracked.

249
00:15:17,615 --> 00:15:20,231
Niles, that woman is certainly not dad's type.

250
00:15:20,232 --> 00:15:24,179
You never know when love can bloom between 
two people who seem so different on the surface.

251
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:25,226
Do you, Daphne?

252
00:15:25,626 --> 00:15:28,571
To tell you the truth, I never thought opposites attract.

253
00:15:28,572 --> 00:15:30,680
Neither do I, we are alike in so many ways.

254
00:15:30,681 --> 00:15:31,982
Oh come on, Niles.

255
00:15:32,511 --> 00:15:34,501
We can't leave dad out there alone with her any longer.

256
00:15:34,502 --> 00:15:35,814
I'm sure they're doing just fine.

257
00:15:35,815 --> 00:15:37,738
D’goo y’goo sp’geak g-sp’geak?

258
00:15:39,542 --> 00:15:41,030
Oh Lord, I was afraid of this.

259
00:15:41,031 --> 00:15:42,033
What?

260
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:44,992
D’goo y’goo sp’geak g-sp’geak?

261
00:15:45,965 --> 00:15:47,918
Niles, I think she's having a stroke or something.

262
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:53,100
No, no dad. It's just G-speak.

263
00:15:53,101 --> 00:15:53,913
Come again?

264
00:15:53,914 --> 00:15:56,458
It's something Maris and Aunt Patrice 
love to try out at parties.

265
00:15:56,459 --> 00:15:59,672
Yes, you just speak a “g” in every syllable.

266
00:15:59,673 --> 00:16:05,956
So you would be, "M’garg-tin Cr’gane." 
Just say it with me, come on... M’garg-tin...

267
00:16:08,183 --> 00:16:09,881
I don't think dad's interested.

268
00:16:09,882 --> 00:16:12,156
Oh, b’ge ag sp’gort, Gniles.

269
00:16:12,157 --> 00:16:12,989
What did she say?

270
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:14,640
She said, "Be a sport, Niles."

271
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:16,839
B’ge, agus, gesport, geda!

272
00:16:18,013 --> 00:16:19,797
Dad, do you still have your billy club?

273
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:22,064
It’s in my top drawer.

274
00:16:22,669 --> 00:16:25,598
Isn't it a hoot? You know, 
it's all the rage in Washington.

275
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:30,162
Of course. You know who speaks it all the time? 
G’George G’Step-gan-ogp-ogu-logs.

276
00:16:33,448 --> 00:16:39,233
I found some pizza rolls in the back of the freezer, 
but the expiration date was yesterday - are we game?

277
00:16:39,234 --> 00:16:41,308
Er, that won't be necessary, Daphne.

278
00:16:41,309 --> 00:16:45,668
We don't want to spoil our appetites for that 
dinner we're about to leave for in twenty minutes.

279
00:16:45,669 --> 00:16:48,696
Yeah, that's right, that dinner in... er... twenty minutes.

280
00:16:48,697 --> 00:16:53,088
Oh Niles, I told you we shouldn't have just stopped by. 
These people have plans.

281
00:16:53,328 --> 00:16:54,457
How I envy them.

282
00:16:55,784 --> 00:16:58,340
It was such a pleasure meeting you, Martin.

283
00:16:58,341 --> 00:16:59,453
Likewise.

284
00:16:59,454 --> 00:17:02,285
Oh, now, now, you can do better than that.

285
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:11,312
- I'll look forward to my next trip to Seattle.
- Great

286
00:17:11,313 --> 00:17:14,945
Oh, and if you're ever in the Washington area - 
I'm in the b’gook. Bye-bye.

287
00:17:18,592 --> 00:17:20,269
What the hell was that?

288
00:17:22,514 --> 00:17:24,450
I feel sorry for the poor thing.

289
00:17:24,451 --> 00:17:25,874
I feel sorry for Niles.

290
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:27,431
That's who I'm talking about.

291
00:17:31,435 --> 00:17:33,309
You know, I saw what you just did.

292
00:17:33,691 --> 00:17:34,599
What did who do?

293
00:17:34,898 --> 00:17:37,233
When Patrice went to hug you, you moved away.

294
00:17:37,834 --> 00:17:38,835
Wouldn't you?

295
00:17:38,836 --> 00:17:41,814
No, dad, no. You moved away from the window.

296
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:45,105
You didn't want Irene to see you with another woman. 
You still care about her.

297
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:46,869
Hey, go chase yourself.

298
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:48,575
Dad, you do.

299
00:17:49,388 --> 00:17:52,834
There's something stopping you from having 
a relationship with this woman. Now, what is it?

300
00:17:52,835 --> 00:17:55,575
- You're not going to let go of this thing, are you?
- No, I'm not!

301
00:17:56,807 --> 00:18:01,393
Alright. Irene's middle name is Rose.

302
00:18:01,394 --> 00:18:04,532
So? Rose is a nice name. Rose was mother's middle name.

303
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:09,862
- Oh.
- Yeah.

304
00:18:11,518 --> 00:18:16,520
Oh dad, you can't feel guilty about that.

305
00:18:16,521 --> 00:18:23,389
Gee, mom's been gone for six years now. 
Your feelings for Irene are totally 
severed from your feelings for Mom.

306
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:26,728
You know, if she was here, if she could tell you, 
she'd want you to get on with your life.

307
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:30,703
Okay, when I'm ready.

308
00:18:31,893 --> 00:18:36,988
Thanks, Frasier. You know - I guess I don't say 
it often enough but you're a good kid.

309
00:18:38,153 --> 00:18:41,476
Well, thanks dad. You know, there's something 
I don't say often enough...

310
00:18:41,477 --> 00:18:43,512
There's nothing you don't say often enough.

311
00:18:45,581 --> 00:18:46,397
Right, dad.

312
00:18:51,495 --> 00:18:54,950
I couldn't help but overhear. 
That was a very nice thing to say.

313
00:18:54,951 --> 00:18:56,421
Yeah, he's a good kid.

314
00:18:57,139 --> 00:19:02,459
The only strange part is - 
I could have sworn Irene's middle name was Marie.

315
00:19:03,131 --> 00:19:04,066
No, it isn't.

316
00:19:04,067 --> 00:19:07,273
Well, I could go and check. 
I still have all our notes in the trash.

317
00:19:07,274 --> 00:19:10,305
Alright, alright... well, 
I had to tell him something.

318
00:19:10,754 --> 00:19:15,850
Look, I don't know why he just won't believe me 
when I tell him that Irene just isn't my type.

319
00:19:16,418 --> 00:19:17,882
You sure she isn't?

320
00:19:18,551 --> 00:19:20,088
You're going to get on my back too?

321
00:19:20,089 --> 00:19:27,403
No, but I was just wondering if the reason why things 
didn't work out between you and Irene was, well...

322
00:19:28,072 --> 00:19:28,987
What?

323
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:33,719
Well, maybe if you weren't just a little 
self-conscious about your hip?

324
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,116
That's ridiculous.

325
00:19:37,117 --> 00:19:41,773
Well, I'm glad to hear that, because you really 
don't have anything to be self-conscious about, you know.

326
00:19:41,774 --> 00:19:47,345
With that silvery mane, twinkling blue eyes 
and whiskey voice. You're quite a package.

327
00:19:49,237 --> 00:19:50,782
Yeah, I'm quite a catch.

328
00:19:50,783 --> 00:20:00,848
You are. And you know as well as I do that history 
is full of sexy limpers. For instance, Franklin Delano Roosevelt.

329
00:20:01,339 --> 00:20:06,776
Of course he didn't limp so much as roll. 
Oh, I know, Toulouse Lautrec.

330
00:20:06,777 --> 00:20:11,910
Although he was rather a little person. Still, 
he did rather well with the ladies.

331
00:20:11,911 --> 00:20:18,278
Of course, they were all prostitutes. 
But then again he was French and there's no explaining their taste.

332
00:20:20,075 --> 00:20:21,170
What's your point?

333
00:20:21,171 --> 00:20:22,876
I guess I don't have one.

334
00:20:22,877 --> 00:20:24,820
It's just me running on the way I do.

335
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:33,115
But there is one last little thing: 
I did notice that every time you went to the telescope 
to see Irene - you hid your cane.

336
00:20:36,424 --> 00:20:40,416
I just put it off to the side so 
I wouldn't trip over the damn thing.

337
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:42,904
I knew there was a good reason.

338
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:46,077
It must feel awful silly when that cane trips you up.

339
00:20:52,579 --> 00:20:56,308
Dad, dad, will you hurry up? She's going to be here any minute.

340
00:20:56,309 --> 00:20:59,965
Alright, alright, Daphne. See if I've got this tie on right?

341
00:20:59,966 --> 00:21:02,054
Just needs a minor adjustment.

342
00:21:03,052 --> 00:21:04,400
What's all this hair on it?

343
00:21:04,401 --> 00:21:07,681
The only way I can get the knot right is if I tie it on Eddie first.

344
00:21:12,418 --> 00:21:17,135
Boy, it's a long time since I've been dating. 
Have things changed much in the last forty years?

345
00:21:17,136 --> 00:21:22,952
Well, the wardrobe’s a little different - 
but your ultimate goal is still the same!

346
00:21:25,787 --> 00:21:27,955
Dad, I'm glad you changed your mind about this.

347
00:21:27,956 --> 00:21:31,192
Yeah, me too. Thanks for our little talk.

348
00:21:31,193 --> 00:21:32,322
My pleasure.

349
00:21:32,867 --> 00:21:35,392
- Now let's see, you got a hanky in there?
- Yep

350
00:21:35,393 --> 00:21:38,297
- Terrific, alright. Have you got your keys?
- Yeah

351
00:21:38,298 --> 00:21:39,640
You're not going to be out too late, are you?

352
00:21:39,641 --> 00:21:42,047
- Frasier!
- Dad, I'm just busting your chops here.

353
00:21:44,501 --> 00:21:46,182
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

354
00:21:46,183 --> 00:21:50,028
Will you two relax? A word to the wise, though:

355
00:21:50,029 --> 00:21:53,238
if she asks you up to her place after dinner - 
close the drapes!

356
00:22:02,609 --> 00:22:08,228
Hi, Irene. Nice to finally meet you.
