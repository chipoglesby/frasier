1
00:00:09,364 --> 00:00:14,015
In the greatest Seattle area, the number is 555-KACL.

2
00:00:14,169 --> 00:00:16,646
We've got a number of lines open, so please give us a call.

3
00:00:16,647 --> 00:00:17,804
Now who's up next, Roz?

4
00:00:17,805 --> 00:00:19,528
We have Pan on line four.

5
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:21,378
She's having a problem with her family.

6
00:00:21,379 --> 00:00:25,235
Hello, Pam. This is Dr. Frasier Crane; I'm listening

7
00:00:25,864 --> 00:00:27,594
Hi. It's my in-laws.

8
00:00:27,595 --> 00:00:28,923
It's just that, well...

9
00:00:29,657 --> 00:00:31,866
they drop over all the time without calling first,

10
00:00:32,024 --> 00:00:34,312
and then expect us to stop what we're doing and entertain them.

11
00:00:34,313 --> 00:00:36,962
Well, they're your husband's parents - what does he suggest?

12
00:00:38,429 --> 00:00:42,070
The other day, he had us drop to the floor and stay quiet until they drove away.

13
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:48,417
A creative approach, but hardly a long-term solution.

14
00:00:48,863 --> 00:00:50,379
Well I, I thought about saying something,

15
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:51,881
but I'm afraid I'll hurt their feelings.

16
00:00:51,882 --> 00:00:53,530
Well, then you have a choice

17
00:00:53,531 --> 00:00:55,369
Either you risk hurting their feelings,

18
00:00:55,370 --> 00:01:00,739
or you spend the rest of your life diving for cover whenever they happen to drop on by...

19
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:02,758
Shhh! They're here!

20
00:01:05,305 --> 00:01:08,690
- Who... your in-laws?
-Shh! Yes.

21
00:01:08,691 --> 00:01:10,963
Well then, why don't you just take this opportunity to...

22
00:01:10,964 --> 00:01:11,890
Oh, for pete's sake!

23
00:01:11,891 --> 00:01:14,154
Why don't you just tell them how you feel?

24
00:01:14,155 --> 00:01:17,539
Okay! Okay. I will next time, I promise! Thanks, Dr. Crane.

25
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:20,416
Yes... ah, well,

26
00:01:20,417 --> 00:01:23,310
as, er, Pam belly-crawls across her living room,

27
00:01:25,096 --> 00:01:27,437
let's take a moment for this message from...

28
00:01:27,438 --> 00:01:29,361
"Carpet Fresh".

29
00:01:29,911 --> 00:01:31,075
How's that for a segue?

30
00:01:37,489 --> 00:01:39,146
I just don't think it's very smart

31
00:01:39,147 --> 00:01:41,129
to make rude gestures at other drivers!

32
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:42,229
He cut you off!

33
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:43,719
That doesn't matter!

34
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:46,655
You, you do not antagonize a man whose bumper sticker says,

35
00:01:46,656 --> 00:01:49,078
"If you're close enough to read this, I'll kill you!"

36
00:01:51,033 --> 00:01:52,750
Big talk from a Volvo.

37
00:01:54,272 --> 00:01:56,137
I see you've found yourself a new suit.

38
00:01:56,138 --> 00:01:57,854
Oh, wait till you see it, Daph - it's a beaut!

39
00:01:57,855 --> 00:01:59,208
Let's have a look!

40
00:01:59,209 --> 00:02:00,779
Oh, can't let you see it on the hanger,

41
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,028
I'll model it for you!

42
00:02:02,029 --> 00:02:05,268
What a nice son you are, buying your father a new suit.

43
00:02:05,463 --> 00:02:08,033
Well, it didn't quite work out the way I planned, but er...

44
00:02:09,048 --> 00:02:10,242
Daphne, what are you doing?

45
00:02:10,243 --> 00:02:11,578
Fluffing your knickers.

46
00:02:13,681 --> 00:02:15,573
If you don't mind my saying so,

47
00:02:15,965 --> 00:02:18,341
you're losing some of your elasticity.

48
00:02:19,066 --> 00:02:20,752
Well, I appreciate everything you're doing, Daphne,

49
00:02:20,753 --> 00:02:22,299
but a man's knickers are certainly...

50
00:02:24,158 --> 00:02:25,407
Ooh...

51
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,556
How'd you get them so... soft?

52
00:02:29,557 --> 00:02:32,574
Fabric softener and twice through the fluff cycle.

53
00:02:32,575 --> 00:02:34,682
Oh, well keep up the good work!

54
00:02:35,878 --> 00:02:36,913
Hello?

55
00:02:37,169 --> 00:02:38,319
Yes. Oh, hi Niles.

56
00:02:38,641 --> 00:02:40,012
Well, of course you can come by!

57
00:02:40,561 --> 00:02:42,204
Great! I'll, I'll see you there!

58
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:51,335
Hi Niles, good to see you!

59
00:02:51,336 --> 00:02:52,577
Thanks for calling first.

60
00:02:52,578 --> 00:02:54,026
Well, I heard you show today.

61
00:02:54,027 --> 00:02:56,303
- I wouldn't dream of popping by unannounced.
- Ahhh...

62
00:02:57,517 --> 00:03:00,100
Actually, I was in the neighborhood, and I've come to beg for a favor.

63
00:03:00,101 --> 00:03:03,836
Er, my housekeeper Mary is a very big fan of your little radio program.

64
00:03:03,837 --> 00:03:04,637
Is she?

65
00:03:04,638 --> 00:03:05,521
Yes. Well,

66
00:03:05,522 --> 00:03:07,638
what she lacks in taste, she makes up for in vigor.

67
00:03:09,547 --> 00:03:11,200
She'd like an autographed photo.

68
00:03:11,201 --> 00:03:12,212
Oh, well, it'd be my pleasure.

69
00:03:12,576 --> 00:03:15,107
Daphne, this is my brother Niles.

70
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:18,798
You're Daphne?

71
00:03:19,321 --> 00:03:20,660
Why, yes I am

72
00:03:20,661 --> 00:03:22,001
Well, I...

73
00:03:22,108 --> 00:03:24,160
When Frasier told me he'd hired an Englishwoman,

74
00:03:24,161 --> 00:03:25,674
I pictured someone a little more...

75
00:03:26,675 --> 00:03:27,553
not quite so...

76
00:03:29,147 --> 00:03:30,358
You're Daphne?

77
00:03:31,814 --> 00:03:33,236
It's nice to meet you.

78
00:03:33,758 --> 00:03:35,853
Well, what a lovely accent. Is that, er, Manchester?

79
00:03:35,854 --> 00:03:36,818
Yes. How'd you know?

80
00:03:36,819 --> 00:03:38,447
Oh, ha! I'm quite the anglophile;

81
00:03:38,448 --> 00:03:40,324
I'm sure Frasier and dad have already told you.

82
00:03:40,325 --> 00:03:42,185
No, they didn't mention it.

83
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:43,979
Ah... you undoubtedly guessed as much

84
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,032
when they said I'd spent a year studying at Cambridge.

85
00:03:46,424 --> 00:03:48,452
No, they didn't mention that, either.

86
00:03:50,034 --> 00:03:53,211
I guess my father and brother don't spend a lot of time talking about me when I'm not around!

87
00:03:53,869 --> 00:03:55,283
Oh, I wouldn't say that...

88
00:03:56,918 --> 00:03:59,650
Niles, here's your picture...

89
00:03:59,651 --> 00:04:00,952
DO YOU MIND?!

90
00:04:03,839 --> 00:04:06,974
"Mary, here's wishing you good mental health: Frasier Crane."

91
00:04:10,005 --> 00:04:11,366
Fits like a glove.

92
00:04:12,061 --> 00:04:15,828
- Hi, Niles!
- Hey, dad... wow.

93
00:04:17,491 --> 00:04:18,280
How do I look?

94
00:04:18,898 --> 00:04:19,665
Wow

95
00:04:22,215 --> 00:04:25,251
Dr. Crane took you father shopping to Armani this afternoon.

96
00:04:25,252 --> 00:04:26,632
You got that at Armani?

97
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,136
Just like I told you, Frasier

98
00:04:28,137 --> 00:04:29,554
he can't tell the difference.

99
00:04:33,192 --> 00:04:35,242
Well, we were on our way to Armani,

100
00:04:35,243 --> 00:04:38,284
when dad spotted this in the window of a discount clothing store.

101
00:04:38,635 --> 00:04:39,914
It's sharkskin!

102
00:04:39,915 --> 00:04:42,123
Look at the way it changes color when I move my arm!

103
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:47,745
You're going to be the handsomest gent at your friend's retirement party.

104
00:04:47,989 --> 00:04:50,776
Now come on, let's go and hang it up before it gets wrinkled.

105
00:04:50,777 --> 00:04:52,323
Oh, it's supposed to resist wrinkles.

106
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,852
They had one in the display window winded up inside a mayonnaise jar!

107
00:04:59,528 --> 00:05:00,999
Frasier, is he our real father?

108
00:05:02,246 --> 00:05:03,221
Now don't start that again

109
00:05:03,222 --> 00:05:05,208
we've been having this discussion since we were children.

110
00:05:08,137 --> 00:05:09,165
But that suit!

111
00:05:09,384 --> 00:05:11,168
Well, it's not just the suit, it's,

112
00:05:11,169 --> 00:05:12,965
it's his taste in everything!

113
00:05:12,966 --> 00:05:14,663
Clothing, films, music...

114
00:05:15,047 --> 00:05:17,930
Outside of our last name and abnormally well-developed calf muscles,

115
00:05:17,931 --> 00:05:19,344
we have nothing in common with the man.

116
00:05:20,679 --> 00:05:22,571
Well, thank goodness we took after mum.

117
00:05:22,837 --> 00:05:24,843
So how come he didn't acquire any of her...

118
00:05:24,844 --> 00:05:26,022
sophistication?

119
00:05:26,023 --> 00:05:28,332
Well, maybe he was too busy working his tail off...

120
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:30,710
- ...so that we could have the nicer things.
- Mmm.

121
00:05:30,987 --> 00:05:33,957
You know Niles, maybe it's time we tried to pay him back in some way.

122
00:05:34,119 --> 00:05:36,929
Expose him to some of the finer things,

123
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:41,877
so that he stop lumbering through life like some great polyester dinosaur.

124
00:05:43,248 --> 00:05:45,385
I don't know. Dad's so set in his ways.

125
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:46,887
Well, we all are at some point in our lives.

126
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:47,978
Remember when you used to think

127
00:05:47,979 --> 00:05:50,831
the 1812 Overture was a great piece of classical music?

128
00:05:51,503 --> 00:05:52,551
Was I ever that young?

129
00:05:58,154 --> 00:06:01,401
Well, you and I have to broaden dad's horizons.

130
00:06:01,857 --> 00:06:04,715
Show him the world that he'd only read about in TV guide.

131
00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:07,890
How about an evening of fine dining?

132
00:06:07,891 --> 00:06:09,839
Perfect... but where?

133
00:06:10,628 --> 00:06:12,435
Le Cigare Volant!

134
00:06:12,436 --> 00:06:14,493
Hah!

135
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,574
But can we really get in? I been trying for months.

136
00:06:17,575 --> 00:06:18,114
Oh, please.

137
00:06:18,115 --> 00:06:20,676
Niles, you're forgetting the cache my name carries in this time.

138
00:06:20,677 --> 00:06:21,764
Actually, I'm not.

139
00:06:21,765 --> 00:06:23,890
If the maitre d' happens to be a housewife, we're in.

140
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:28,500
Niles, you are so mean.

141
00:06:30,217 --> 00:06:31,367
I'll just call information.

142
00:06:31,368 --> 00:06:33,942
- Oh, no need; I have it on speed dial.
- Oh.

143
00:06:35,476 --> 00:06:36,075
Thank you

144
00:06:36,954 --> 00:06:39,323
Hello, this is Dr. Frasier Crane.

145
00:06:39,805 --> 00:06:41,651
Yes, the one on the radio.

146
00:06:42,262 --> 00:06:48,947
Say... any chance of, er, getting a table for four on Saturday at, et, say... eight, hmm?

147
00:06:49,563 --> 00:06:51,047
Merci, a bientôt!

148
00:06:51,048 --> 00:06:52,366
Ah! We're in!

149
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:55,039
Niles, can I get you a beer?

150
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,333
Some pork rinds?

151
00:06:56,856 --> 00:06:58,529
No thanks, Em...

152
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:07,372
Dad, Niles and I and Maris would like you to join us for Saturday night at, Le Cigare Volante

153
00:07:07,373 --> 00:07:09,006
it's one of the hottest new restaurants in town.

154
00:07:09,007 --> 00:07:11,215
Ah, gee, I don't know...

155
00:07:11,216 --> 00:07:12,662
Oh, oh-oh-oh, the food is to die for!

156
00:07:12,663 --> 00:07:15,121
Niles, you country and your family are to die for,

157
00:07:15,122 --> 00:07:16,333
food is to eat.

158
00:07:17,487 --> 00:07:20,002
Look, I appreciate the offer, but I wouldn't like it.

159
00:07:20,003 --> 00:07:21,589
Oh dad, how do you know if you don't try it?

160
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:24,888
Well, I didn't have to get shot in the hip wih a 38 to know I wouldn't like that.

161
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:26,814
Yes, but, dad,

162
00:07:26,815 --> 00:07:30,117
It'll give us a chance to have an evening all together as a family.

163
00:07:30,118 --> 00:07:32,072
You know, Niles and I really want to do this for you.

164
00:07:34,347 --> 00:07:35,536
Oh... alright.

165
00:07:37,071 --> 00:07:38,354
We're gonna have the best time!

166
00:07:38,355 --> 00:07:41,181
Hey - it'll give me a chance to wear my suit again, too.

167
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:43,785
And won't that be nice?

168
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,889
So, how do the calls look today?

169
00:07:50,194 --> 00:07:52,302
Well, we've got a couple of jilted lovers,

170
00:07:52,303 --> 00:07:53,695
a man who's afraid of his car,

171
00:07:53,696 --> 00:07:54,997
a manic depressive,

172
00:07:54,998 --> 00:07:57,202
and three people who feel their lives are going nowhere.

173
00:07:57,203 --> 00:07:58,257
Oh, I love a monday.

174
00:07:59,991 --> 00:08:01,313
So how was you weekend?

175
00:08:01,431 --> 00:08:03,994
I had the most hellacious date of my life.

176
00:08:04,436 --> 00:08:06,388
First, he asks me to pick him up from work.

177
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:10,751
Then, I stop for gas - I have to pump it myself while he sits there reading the sports section.

178
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:14,654
So I take him back to my place and make him my famous sweet and sour shrimp;

179
00:08:14,655 --> 00:08:16,991
I'm in the middle of cooking, I ask him to hand me the honey,

180
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:23,024
and he gets this freaked-out look on his face and says he can't because he has a deathly fear of touching anything sticky.

181
00:08:25,754 --> 00:08:28,648
I told him it was a new jar, but he didn't want to take any risks.

182
00:08:29,221 --> 00:08:30,977
Roz, where do you meet these people?

183
00:08:30,978 --> 00:08:32,328
I answered his ad!

184
00:08:35,665 --> 00:08:37,319
You got thirty seconds - you'd better get in there.

185
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,439
- Not yet.
- Oh, no...

186
00:08:38,744 --> 00:08:39,740
Roz, are you ready?

187
00:08:39,741 --> 00:08:41,145
Don't make me do this...

188
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:42,434
Come on, we do this every Monday!

189
00:08:42,435 --> 00:08:44,340
You do this every Monday. I play along!

190
00:08:44,341 --> 00:08:45,484
Come on!

191
00:08:46,661 --> 00:08:48,553
Who's got the best talk show in Seattle?

192
00:08:48,554 --> 00:08:50,093
We do. We do.

193
00:08:50,094 --> 00:08:51,046
Alright!

194
00:09:03,007 --> 00:09:06,449
We-ell! Aren't you a bobby dazzler?

195
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:08,779
Well, I'll go out on a limb and take that as a compliment.

196
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:12,522
Where are you off to?

197
00:09:12,523 --> 00:09:14,037
I'm going to poker night.

198
00:09:14,354 --> 00:09:16,047
I wouldn't have pegged you as a card player.

199
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,545
It's mostly social.

200
00:09:18,546 --> 00:09:20,986
Me and the girls just bumping the gums.

201
00:09:21,997 --> 00:09:25,376
No-one ever loses more than five or six hundred dollars.

202
00:09:27,454 --> 00:09:28,689
- Hi, Niles!
- Hello.

203
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:29,630
Where's Maris?

204
00:09:29,631 --> 00:09:31,370
Are you two taking separate elevators again?

205
00:09:31,371 --> 00:09:32,334
Oh, no.

206
00:09:32,335 --> 00:09:35,102
- I'm afraid Maris is having one of her episodes.
- Ah...

207
00:09:35,645 --> 00:09:36,844
In the middle of dressing for the evening,

208
00:09:36,845 --> 00:09:40,350
she suddenly slumped down on the edge of the bed in her half-slip and sighed.

209
00:09:41,766 --> 00:09:43,939
Course, I knew then and there that dinner was not to be.

210
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:45,106
I'm sorry.

211
00:09:45,453 --> 00:09:47,065
Yes, well, I'll just have to make the best of it...

212
00:09:47,066 --> 00:09:49,325
Hi-ho, Daphne, you're looking luminous this evening!

213
00:09:51,176 --> 00:09:52,710
Why thank you, Dr. Crane.

214
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,314
What's in the bag?

215
00:09:54,315 --> 00:09:56,367
Er, just a little treat I picked up for dad:

216
00:09:56,368 --> 00:09:58,146
some Devonshire Clotted Cream.

217
00:09:59,034 --> 00:09:59,932
For... dad?

218
00:10:00,753 --> 00:10:02,328
I love Devonshire Clotted Cream.

219
00:10:02,642 --> 00:10:04,315
Isn't that lucky - you two can share it.

220
00:10:04,526 --> 00:10:06,454
I'll just go and pop this in the fridge.

221
00:10:08,322 --> 00:10:09,820
- Sherry, Niles?
- Thank you.

222
00:10:11,684 --> 00:10:13,145
I'm having a thought, Frasier.

223
00:10:13,804 --> 00:10:16,530
Since Maris has sadly dropped out and we do have an extra space,

224
00:10:17,019 --> 00:10:20,036
perhaps we should invite Daphne to join us for the evening.

225
00:10:20,347 --> 00:10:25,128
I mean, it is a table for four and, and three is such an awkward number,

226
00:10:25,129 --> 00:10:27,997
you know, at a, at a dinner.

227
00:10:29,784 --> 00:10:30,891
What are you doing?

228
00:10:34,316 --> 00:10:35,511
Nothing, nothing...

229
00:10:36,182 --> 00:10:37,769
Oh, for goodness sake, Frasier!

230
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:38,951
I'm a happily married man!

231
00:10:39,206 --> 00:10:40,752
Maris means the world to me.

232
00:10:40,753 --> 00:10:43,544
Why, just the other day I kissed her for no reason whatsoever.

233
00:10:45,547 --> 00:10:47,778
Well, I'm off to my poker game.

234
00:10:48,259 --> 00:10:50,465
It was nice seeing you again, Dr. Crane...

235
00:10:51,623 --> 00:10:52,866
Oh, wait a minute!

236
00:10:52,867 --> 00:10:54,750
I'm getting something on you...

237
00:10:56,444 --> 00:10:59,072
She's psychic. We've decided to find it charming.

238
00:11:05,116 --> 00:11:08,583
You have occasional bouts of colitis, don't you?

239
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,236
Yes!

240
00:11:15,165 --> 00:11:17,221
Frasier... she's phenomenal!

241
00:11:17,767 --> 00:11:20,503
- It's a gift. Well, cheerio!
- Ta-ta!

242
00:11:21,792 --> 00:11:23,615
Niles, you've never had colitis a day in your life!

243
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:25,359
I know, but I couldn't bear to disappoint her...

244
00:11:27,898 --> 00:11:29,646
'Kay! I'm ready to go!

245
00:11:30,437 --> 00:11:34,126
Ah, ah, dad, what's happened to your suit?

246
00:11:34,127 --> 00:11:35,289
Oh, it's at the cleaners.

247
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:38,426
I got some creamed chicken on it at Phil's retirement dinner last night.

248
00:11:38,912 --> 00:11:40,531
You can't keep anything nice.

249
00:11:41,239 --> 00:11:44,330
Well, well, I-I-I-I'm sure the Cigare Volante has a dress code...

250
00:11:44,331 --> 00:11:46,303
Er Niles, may I borrow your phone?

251
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:48,807
Thank you so much.

252
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:51,338
- Where's Maris?
- Episode.
- Oh.

253
00:11:53,896 --> 00:11:56,560
Yes hello, this is Dr Frasier Crane, I have a reservation tonight.

254
00:11:56,561 --> 00:12:00,535
I'm calling to enquire about you, minimun dress code.

255
00:12:03,525 --> 00:12:06,868
Crane. Frasier. Doctor!

256
00:12:07,246 --> 00:12:09,412
Well, what do you... we've had the reservation for over a week!

257
00:12:09,655 --> 00:12:10,985
They've lost our reservation.

258
00:12:10,986 --> 00:12:11,703
Give me that.

259
00:12:12,548 --> 00:12:14,127
Listen, this is Dr. Niles Crane.

260
00:12:14,128 --> 00:12:16,224
I've never been treated so shabbily in my entire life

261
00:12:16,225 --> 00:12:18,798
and I've a good mind to come over there and create and embarrassing scene.

262
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:19,785
Niles, they've already hung up.

263
00:12:19,786 --> 00:12:20,973
Ah... thank god!

264
00:12:24,979 --> 00:12:27,142
Well, what now, Frasier?

265
00:12:27,143 --> 00:12:28,425
It's saturday night, quarter-to-eight,

266
00:12:28,426 --> 00:12:29,967
and we-we're not going to get to anywhere.

267
00:12:30,819 --> 00:12:32,254
Hey, I know!

268
00:12:32,989 --> 00:12:35,195
Why don't I take us all to The Timber Mill?

269
00:12:35,814 --> 00:12:36,665
The... Timber Mill?

270
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:37,916
Oh, it's great!

271
00:12:37,917 --> 00:12:40,408
You can get a steak this thick for eight ninety-five!

272
00:12:40,409 --> 00:12:41,702
Ah... honestly, dad,

273
00:12:41,703 --> 00:12:44,153
that doesn't sound like the kind of restaurant we'd like.

274
00:12:44,154 --> 00:12:46,226
Well, I was willing to go to your place.

275
00:12:46,227 --> 00:12:50,027
Er, dad, I - I think we'd better just er, take a rain check.

276
00:12:50,028 --> 00:12:53,175
Oh gee, I was looking forward to spending an evening with you boys.

277
00:12:53,558 --> 00:12:55,221
But we can do it some other time.

278
00:12:55,493 --> 00:12:58,492
I'm sure Daphne's got something in the fridge I can heat up...

279
00:13:04,722 --> 00:13:06,323
You know, on second thoughts I'm,

280
00:13:06,324 --> 00:13:08,444
I'm really in the mood for a good steak!

281
00:13:08,671 --> 00:13:09,412
What?

282
00:13:10,777 --> 00:13:11,671
Well yes, you know,

283
00:13:11,672 --> 00:13:13,964
the point of the whole thing is not exactly where we have dinner,

284
00:13:13,965 --> 00:13:17,024
but that the three of us have an evening together as a family! Right?

285
00:13:17,025 --> 00:13:18,413
Ah, you won't be sorry!

286
00:13:18,414 --> 00:13:20,981
They've got five different toppings for your baked potato!

287
00:13:20,982 --> 00:13:21,945
Ooh, did you hear that, Niles?

288
00:13:21,946 --> 00:13:23,182
I'm sold!

289
00:13:23,787 --> 00:13:25,168
We'll bring you a bone, Eddie!

290
00:13:26,265 --> 00:13:27,525
He's ecstatic.

291
00:13:34,172 --> 00:13:35,705
Quite a place, huh?

292
00:13:35,706 --> 00:13:37,510
Used to be a real working saw-mill!

293
00:13:37,511 --> 00:13:40,088
Until somebody stated the obvious and said:

294
00:13:40,089 --> 00:13:42,581
"Hey, let's turn this place into a restaurant!"

295
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:46,422
I just walk in here and my mouth starts watering.

296
00:13:46,423 --> 00:13:49,053
There's nothing like the smell of charbroided meat.

297
00:13:49,054 --> 00:13:51,299
This aroma's triggering a, a sense memory.

298
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,087
Something familiar. It...

299
00:13:53,088 --> 00:13:56,359
oh, of course, Maris in her home tanning bed.

300
00:14:00,075 --> 00:14:02,353
Hi! Welcome to The Timber Mill.

301
00:14:02,354 --> 00:14:04,929
You don't have a table for three... do you?

302
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:06,761
Sure, right this way.

303
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:11,193
- Is this your first visit to The Timber Mill?
- Yes.

304
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:13,712
Well, we've got a dress code.

305
00:14:13,713 --> 00:14:15,555
Oh well, couldn't you make an exception in this case?

306
00:14:15,556 --> 00:14:16,856
- His suit was at the cleaners-

307
00:14:16,857 --> 00:14:18,089
- Er, not him. You.

308
00:14:19,557 --> 00:14:21,520
Tim-berrr!

309
00:14:23,587 --> 00:14:25,239
My tie!

310
00:14:25,737 --> 00:14:27,199
She, she cut off my tie!

311
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,664
Gotcha! Ain't that great!

312
00:14:28,665 --> 00:14:30,112
Well, why did she cut off my tie?!

313
00:14:30,113 --> 00:14:31,638
Oh, they've been doing it for years!

314
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:33,433
They like to keep the place casual.

315
00:14:33,434 --> 00:14:34,691
Dad, you could have mentioned to us.

316
00:14:34,692 --> 00:14:36,354
What, and spoil the fun?

317
00:14:37,802 --> 00:14:40,652
Ah, cheer up! You get a free dessert!

318
00:14:40,653 --> 00:14:41,375
Oh, boy.

319
00:14:41,852 --> 00:14:45,544
Well, I guess you're right, dad; it's just a tie.

320
00:14:45,822 --> 00:14:47,225
A Hugo Boss tie.

321
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:52,529
Hi, can I get you guys something from the bar?

322
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:53,638
Oh dear God, yes.

323
00:14:56,384 --> 00:14:59,925
I'll have a Stoli Gibson on the rock, with three pearl onions.

324
00:14:59,926 --> 00:15:02,625
If you bring him two, if you bring him four...

325
00:15:02,931 --> 00:15:04,242
he'll send it back.

326
00:15:04,243 --> 00:15:05,635
- And for you?
- The same.

327
00:15:07,349 --> 00:15:08,581
I'll have a Ballantine.

328
00:15:11,882 --> 00:15:13,826
Say, funny thing happened the other day:

329
00:15:13,827 --> 00:15:16,845
one of my patients had a rather amusing Freudian slip.

330
00:15:16,846 --> 00:15:18,971
He was having dinner with his wife, and he meant to say,

331
00:15:18,972 --> 00:15:20,780
"pass the salt," but instead he said,

332
00:15:20,781 --> 00:15:22,765
"You've ruined my life, you blood-sucking shrew."

333
00:15:29,043 --> 00:15:30,446
Bet she didn't like that.

334
00:15:32,215 --> 00:15:34,456
N-no, no dad, she didn't,

335
00:15:36,944 --> 00:15:39,543
Say, how was your buddy's retirement party last night?

336
00:15:39,544 --> 00:15:41,151
Oh, it was great.

337
00:15:41,152 --> 00:15:43,085
You know, I really miss those guys.

338
00:15:43,605 --> 00:15:46,702
Bad new, though. Remember Mo Hanson?

339
00:15:47,067 --> 00:15:48,715
The desk captain of my old precinct?

340
00:15:48,716 --> 00:15:50,451
Killed in a boating accident.

341
00:15:50,452 --> 00:15:51,577
Oh, I'm sorry.

342
00:15:51,578 --> 00:15:53,305
Yeah. Well, at least he went quick.

343
00:15:53,798 --> 00:15:58,219
Hank Grinsky - well he had three bypasses before he went.

344
00:15:59,618 --> 00:16:02,658
Jimmy Bourbon, he had this weird disease.

345
00:16:02,659 --> 00:16:04,029
I went to visit him in the hospital;

346
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:04,944
by the time he died,

347
00:16:04,945 --> 00:16:08,282
his skin all yellow, wasted away to nothing.

348
00:16:09,175 --> 00:16:11,751
Nice nurse, though - Betty I think her name was.

349
00:16:13,977 --> 00:16:16,347
I see we have a couple of first-times here!

350
00:16:16,348 --> 00:16:17,777
Let me tell you how it works.

351
00:16:17,778 --> 00:16:21,305
Every entrée comes with soup or a trip to the salad bar:

352
00:16:21,306 --> 00:16:22,924
one trip only, please!

353
00:16:22,925 --> 00:16:26,063
Also included is our famous garlic cheese bread.

354
00:16:26,064 --> 00:16:29,180
And now if you're ready, you can claim your steaks.

355
00:16:29,181 --> 00:16:30,270
Claim our steaks...?

356
00:16:30,271 --> 00:16:32,511
You get to pick the cut you want off the bed trolley!

357
00:16:39,229 --> 00:16:43,457
How much extra would I have to pay to get one from the refrigerator?

358
00:16:45,747 --> 00:16:47,329
Would you just pick your steak?

359
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:49,975
I'll, I'd like a, a petite filet mignon,

360
00:16:49,976 --> 00:16:52,261
very lean - not so lean that it lacks flavour,

361
00:16:52,262 --> 00:16:54,384
but not so fat that it leaves drippings on the plate.

362
00:16:54,385 --> 00:16:57,739
And I don't want it cooked - just lightly seared on either side,

363
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:00,704
pink in the middle; not a true pink, but not a mauve either,

364
00:17:00,705 --> 00:17:01,735
something in between.

365
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:06,869
Bearing in mind the slightest error either way, and it's ruined.

366
00:17:07,219 --> 00:17:08,220
...Okay!

367
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:13,485
How about you?

368
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,157
Could I see the other side of that one?

369
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:19,999
Just bring us those three:

370
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,155
medium-rate, all the 'fixins.

371
00:17:22,951 --> 00:17:23,957
Hey, come on!

372
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:25,648
There's a lull at the salad bar!

373
00:17:32,211 --> 00:17:33,007
Isn't this great?

374
00:17:33,008 --> 00:17:35,104
They have the best Thousand Island Dressing in town.

375
00:17:35,105 --> 00:17:37,574
I know, dad, I saw the plaque by the cash register.

376
00:17:38,353 --> 00:17:41,353
Here we go: three boiled onions, medium-rare!

377
00:17:41,354 --> 00:17:43,220
Wha-? We've barely touched our salads!

378
00:17:43,221 --> 00:17:44,277
Great service, huh?

379
00:17:44,278 --> 00:17:45,234
Yes. With any luck...

380
00:17:45,235 --> 00:17:47,929
we should be completing our dining experience in less that twenty minutes.

381
00:17:48,891 --> 00:17:51,043
If you're not ready I could put this under the heat lamp...

382
00:17:51,044 --> 00:17:53,188
Oh no, no-no, that won't be necessary young lady,

383
00:17:53,189 --> 00:17:55,226
I'm as ready as I'll ever be...

384
00:17:55,227 --> 00:17:56,460
Alright.

385
00:17:56,461 --> 00:17:58,208
Let me know if I can get you anything else.

386
00:17:58,209 --> 00:17:59,434
Yes, thank you.

387
00:17:59,887 --> 00:18:02,072
You know, I don't mind you guys being tough on this place,

388
00:18:02,073 --> 00:18:03,818
but you could be a little nicer to the waitress.

389
00:18:04,407 --> 00:18:05,604
You're right.

390
00:18:05,605 --> 00:18:07,932
I'll apologize when she comes with the dessert.

391
00:18:07,933 --> 00:18:09,451
Which should be any time now.

392
00:18:13,135 --> 00:18:16,278
Sometimes there's nothing like a good steak.

393
00:18:16,677 --> 00:18:18,501
I wish this was one of those times.

394
00:18:20,552 --> 00:18:21,495
What's wrong?

395
00:18:21,829 --> 00:18:24,407
- Well, I don't mean to complain, but...
- Well, then don't!

396
00:18:24,723 --> 00:18:28,503
For your information, these steaks come from prized beef raised...

397
00:18:28,504 --> 00:18:29,921
What the hell are you doing?

398
00:18:31,055 --> 00:18:33,099
Something seems to have fallen in my potato.

399
00:18:33,318 --> 00:18:34,643
Those are bacon bits!

400
00:18:35,249 --> 00:18:36,443
But I didn't ask for them.

401
00:18:36,444 --> 00:18:38,625
I ordered all the 'fixins. You got all the 'fixins.

402
00:18:38,626 --> 00:18:40,499
But I don't eat bacon because of the nitrates.

403
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,072
No problem. They're artificial. They're made out of soy.

404
00:18:43,073 --> 00:18:45,261
They really look out for your health here, don't they?

405
00:18:48,194 --> 00:18:50,608
Everybody in this restaurant's enjoying the dinner.

406
00:18:50,609 --> 00:18:51,967
Can't you guys do the same?

407
00:18:57,985 --> 00:18:59,353
- Niles...
- Mmm-hmm?

408
00:19:00,638 --> 00:19:02,478
- Is Maris organizing the...

409
00:19:04,024 --> 00:19:06,333
Arts Council benefit again, this year?

410
00:19:06,334 --> 00:19:07,889
Matter of fact, she is.

411
00:19:08,485 --> 00:19:09,811
Where are they holding it?

412
00:19:09,812 --> 00:19:11,120
Well, they haven't picked a spot yet...

413
00:19:11,565 --> 00:19:13,353
perhaps I should tell them about this place!

414
00:19:19,062 --> 00:19:20,987
I'd like to be a fly on the wall that night!

415
00:19:20,988 --> 00:19:22,568
You wouldn't be the only one!

416
00:19:24,582 --> 00:19:26,083
Alright, that's it.

417
00:19:27,352 --> 00:19:29,120
I've had enough of you two jack-asses.

418
00:19:29,598 --> 00:19:32,545
I've spent the whole night listening to you making cracks about the food and the help.

419
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:35,192
Well, I got news for you: people like this place.

420
00:19:35,801 --> 00:19:37,154
I like this place.

421
00:19:37,155 --> 00:19:39,570
And when you insult this restaurant, you insult me.

422
00:19:40,723 --> 00:19:43,147
You know, I used to think you two took after your mother.

423
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:44,739
liking the ballet and all that,

424
00:19:45,067 --> 00:19:47,275
but you mother liked a good ball game too.

425
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:49,318
She even had a hot dog once in a while.

426
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,304
She may have had fancy tastes,

427
00:19:51,305 --> 00:19:54,232
but she had too much class to ever make me or anybody else feel second-rate.

428
00:19:54,797 --> 00:19:57,240
If she saw the way you two have behaved tonight, she'd be ashamed.

429
00:19:58,277 --> 00:19:59,567
I know I am.

430
00:20:00,517 --> 00:20:01,603
Dad, wait!

431
00:20:01,604 --> 00:20:03,548
No, I'm going over to Duke's for a night-cap.

432
00:20:03,549 --> 00:20:04,843
Well, at least let us take you there!

433
00:20:04,844 --> 00:20:05,849
I'll take the cab!

434
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:07,249
I've had enough of you two for one night.

435
00:20:07,805 --> 00:20:11,094
Leave the waitress a good tip. She deserves  it.

436
00:20:11,964 --> 00:20:13,450
Niles, say something!

437
00:20:14,195 --> 00:20:15,421
Dad, wait...

438
00:20:17,103 --> 00:20:18,364
...the Mud Pie's coming!

439
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:30,430
"The Mud Pie's Coming!"

440
00:20:36,457 --> 00:20:37,924
I feel terrible.

441
00:20:37,925 --> 00:20:38,848
Oh, so do I...

442
00:20:39,376 --> 00:20:41,366
The sad thing is, he's right about us.

443
00:20:41,873 --> 00:20:43,470
Have we really become such snobs?

444
00:20:43,471 --> 00:20:46,344
You don't see anybody else driving their father out into the street to drink, do you?

445
00:20:56,738 --> 00:20:59,141
Niles, we... we've gotta apologize to dad.

446
00:20:59,142 --> 00:21:00,109
You're right.

447
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:02,348
We'll give him a couple of hours to cool down over at Duke's,

448
00:21:02,349 --> 00:21:04,400
and then when he gets home, we'll, we'll settle this thing.

449
00:21:04,401 --> 00:21:06,484
Absolutely. We've been just horrid.

450
00:21:07,407 --> 00:21:12,177
Frasier... do you think we've actually lost the ability to appreciate the simple things?

451
00:21:12,178 --> 00:21:14,390
Steak, potatoes... 'fixins?

452
00:21:17,867 --> 00:21:19,280
I'm afraid so.

453
00:21:19,977 --> 00:21:22,774
Well you know, the thing is, this-this is, this is good food!

454
00:21:22,775 --> 00:21:26,872
It's not too fancy but it's, it's, it's food, wholesome American fare!

455
00:21:26,873 --> 00:21:29,676
You know Frasier, as a tribute to dad,

456
00:21:29,677 --> 00:21:32,821
I think we should sit here until we have cleaned our plates.

457
00:21:33,837 --> 00:21:35,493
Well, I'm game if you are!

458
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:43,869
Going to prove we are not snobs.

459
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:45,633
Absolutely.

460
00:21:51,194 --> 00:21:52,472
- Frasier...
- Hmm?

461
00:21:52,473 --> 00:21:53,382
Look who's here.

462
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:08,139
Eat your meal!
