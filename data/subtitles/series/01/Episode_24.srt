1
00:00:08,472 --> 00:00:11,623
Calm down, dear. Listen.

2
00:00:11,936 --> 00:00:16,930
Take a left, then the second right,
then a left again.

3
00:00:17,319 --> 00:00:20,595
- Ok. Goodbye, sweetheart.
- Is maris lost again?

4
00:00:20,909 --> 00:00:23,104
She wandered
into the kitchen by mistake.

5
00:00:23,371 --> 00:00:26,363
I had to talk her back to the living room.

6
00:00:28,839 --> 00:00:31,034
Any chance of getting a table?

7
00:00:31,301 --> 00:00:34,611
No. They got their check
five minutes ago,

8
00:00:34,932 --> 00:00:36,888
but they've been
sitting there ever since.

9
00:00:37,144 --> 00:00:40,819
- I shoot them dirty looks, all in vain.
- Show me the look.

10
00:00:43,363 --> 00:00:46,116
They're there for a while.

11
00:00:46,409 --> 00:00:48,400
- Shall we order?
- Why not?

12
00:00:48,663 --> 00:00:51,416
- What are your coffees today?
- Zimbabwe and kenya.

13
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:55,862
- Ooh, i'll have a zimbabwe latte.
- I'll have a kenya cappuccino.

14
00:00:56,218 --> 00:00:58,049
So what's new?

15
00:00:58,304 --> 00:01:01,262
The gardener finally won
the battle of the wills.

16
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:06,314
He got maris to dig up her camellias
so he could put in that zen garden.

17
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:08,728
- How did it turn out?
- It's beautiful.

18
00:01:08,988 --> 00:01:10,944
The perfect place for meditation.

19
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,113
Yesterday i found maris
sitting in the lotus position.

20
00:01:15,457 --> 00:01:18,449
Good for her.
It's bringing out her spiritual side.

21
00:01:18,754 --> 00:01:21,188
She was reading danielle steele

22
00:01:21,467 --> 00:01:25,460
and making a nail appointment
on her phone.

23
00:01:25,808 --> 00:01:28,925
Do you realise that it's a year
since i moved from boston?

24
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:33,746
Really? A year? It seems like yesterday
dad moved in with you.

25
00:01:34,113 --> 00:01:37,822
People can have opposite impressions
of the same event.

26
00:01:38,162 --> 00:01:41,871
Look at them. Sitting there
like they own that table.

27
00:01:42,209 --> 00:01:45,406
- Let's both give them the look.
- It's worth a try.

28
00:01:48,011 --> 00:01:51,083
- It worked!
- Niles, i'll never doubt you again!

29
00:01:58,612 --> 00:02:02,002
Try the look on that table.
I'm going to the men's room.

30
00:02:05,247 --> 00:02:07,203
- Maddening!
- What?

31
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:12,295
The moisturiser dispenser in the gents.
The cream is too oily, so i re-washed.

32
00:02:12,676 --> 00:02:15,474
And then the hand dryer breaks down.

33
00:02:15,765 --> 00:02:18,677
How do you get through the day?

34
00:02:18,978 --> 00:02:22,175
- Here you go, zimbabwe and kenya.
- Thank you.

35
00:02:22,485 --> 00:02:24,680
- Did i say decaf?
- No.

36
00:02:24,947 --> 00:02:27,302
Oh, i'm sorry. If i drink the regular stuff,

37
00:02:27,576 --> 00:02:31,091
it'll keep me tossing and turning
through my brother's conversation.

38
00:02:31,415 --> 00:02:33,690
(waitress) 'no problem.'
(frasier) 'thank you.'

39
00:02:33,962 --> 00:02:36,601
Nobody's leaving.
Let's take a table outside.

40
00:02:36,883 --> 00:02:39,317
Why not? I'm feeling al fresco.

41
00:02:39,596 --> 00:02:43,032
Oh, how does mrs fresco
feel about that?

42
00:02:55,247 --> 00:02:57,397
Must be a riot on camping trips.

43
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:02,082
- Would you like a...?
- No.

44
00:03:03,927 --> 00:03:08,364
Now that chapter two of your life is in
full swing, can i ask you something?

45
00:03:08,728 --> 00:03:11,401
- Sure.
- Are you happy?

46
00:03:13,986 --> 00:03:16,898
- Did you hear the question?
- Yes, i'm thinking.

47
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,873
- It's a complex question.
- No, it's not.

48
00:03:20,163 --> 00:03:22,358
- It is.
- Either you're happy or not.

49
00:03:22,626 --> 00:03:26,460
- Are you?
- No, but we're not talking about me.

50
00:03:26,798 --> 00:03:32,111
Let's not gloss over that. You have
just told me you're not happy. Why?

51
00:03:33,477 --> 00:03:37,152
I was watching pbs the other night -
a documentary

52
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:39,792
on the great depression.
Vintage steinbeck.

53
00:03:40,071 --> 00:03:42,539
Poor people escaping the dust bowl,

54
00:03:42,826 --> 00:03:49,095
their meagre possessions on rickety,
old trucks heading to their "salvation".

55
00:03:49,545 --> 00:03:53,936
You see this scruffy little boy
being handed a new pair of shoes.

56
00:03:54,302 --> 00:03:58,693
Frasier, if you could have seen
the look on that boy's face.

57
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:02,814
It was a look
of pure and utter happiness.

58
00:04:03,985 --> 00:04:07,694
I have never experienced
that kind of happiness in my life.

59
00:04:08,033 --> 00:04:11,912
Not even when i bought
these $400 bruno maglis.

60
00:04:13,459 --> 00:04:15,415
- Do you like them?
- Very nice.

61
00:04:15,671 --> 00:04:18,469
- What about the tassels?
- I'm not a tassel guy.

62
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:21,319
Neither am i.
Nevertheless, there they are.

63
00:04:24,811 --> 00:04:28,645
I have no reason to be unhappy.
I have my health.

64
00:04:28,985 --> 00:04:31,180
I have a wonderful home,
a beautiful wife.

65
00:04:31,447 --> 00:04:34,166
- Did your eyebrow just move?
- No.

66
00:04:35,454 --> 00:04:37,410
I have my practice.

67
00:04:37,665 --> 00:04:40,543
But i've lost the ideals that led me
to psychiatry in the first place.

68
00:04:40,837 --> 00:04:45,308
Who am i talking to? Psychiatry's
answer to the drive-through window.

69
00:04:48,016 --> 00:04:51,929
Sometimes i wonder
if i'm not just in it for the money.

70
00:04:52,273 --> 00:04:55,982
Oh, i wouldn't say that's true.
If it were... oh.

71
00:04:56,321 --> 00:04:58,915
- What were you going to say?
- I'd rather not.

72
00:04:59,201 --> 00:05:03,194
There's no need to. I know what
you've wanted to ask me for years:

73
00:05:04,377 --> 00:05:06,891
Did i marry maris for the money?

74
00:05:08,299 --> 00:05:11,848
I resent that!
I did not marry maris for the money.

75
00:05:12,181 --> 00:05:16,413
- It was just a delightful bonus.
- So you really do love her?

76
00:05:16,772 --> 00:05:20,242
Of course i love her!
But it's a different kind of love.

77
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,720
You mean, it's not human?

78
00:05:25,369 --> 00:05:29,806
No. I mean, it doesn't burn
with the passion of a tristan and isolde.

79
00:05:30,168 --> 00:05:34,286
It's more comfortable, more familiar.
Maris and i are old friends.

80
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:36,750
We can spend an afternoon together,

81
00:05:37,014 --> 00:05:41,565
me at my jigsaw puzzle,
she at her autoharp,

82
00:05:41,938 --> 00:05:45,613
not a word spoken between us,
and be perfectly content.

83
00:05:46,905 --> 00:05:51,695
I'm told it was a lot like that
near the end in the hitler household.

84
00:05:53,165 --> 00:05:55,759
Let's shift the subject
back to where it belongs.

85
00:05:56,045 --> 00:05:59,355
I asked you whether you were happy.
Just answer.

86
00:05:59,676 --> 00:06:02,554
- Well...
- hey, guys.

87
00:06:02,848 --> 00:06:05,237
- Hi, roz.
- What are you doing here?

88
00:06:05,518 --> 00:06:07,588
I always wanted to fly a jet,

89
00:06:07,856 --> 00:06:11,929
and today they're offering
a special on jet-flying lessons.

90
00:06:13,824 --> 00:06:16,975
I came here to get coffee.

91
00:06:17,288 --> 00:06:20,644
Thanks for stopping by.
I'd have been mad if you didn't.

92
00:06:20,961 --> 00:06:23,031
I'm also meeting someone here.

93
00:06:23,298 --> 00:06:25,050
Oh, let me guess. A man?

94
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:27,053
- Yes.
- Yes.

95
00:06:27,305 --> 00:06:31,856
The new guy from the news department
caught me checking him out.

96
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:36,348
- He was bent over the water fountain.
- Love at first sight.

97
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:40,006
He said, "let's get some coffee
and get acquainted."

98
00:06:40,326 --> 00:06:44,365
I've got a strange feeling
that this guy might be the one.

99
00:06:44,709 --> 00:06:50,466
You say that about every guy you meet.
Let's just see if this one calls back.

100
00:06:52,096 --> 00:06:55,452
Yeah, i guess.
You know, i don't think he's here yet.

101
00:06:55,768 --> 00:06:58,521
- I'll go snag a table.
- Good luck.

102
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:02,285
- Bye, roz.
- Yeah.

103
00:07:02,614 --> 00:07:06,209
- I don't think she likes me.
- It isn't a question of liking or not liking.

104
00:07:06,536 --> 00:07:10,370
- She despises you.
- Really?

105
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:14,180
I warrant such strong emotions?
I barely acknowledge her existence.

106
00:07:14,507 --> 00:07:17,067
You may be
on to something there, sherlock.

107
00:07:23,773 --> 00:07:27,288
She is comely
in a back-alley sort of way.

108
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,569
She's very attractive.

109
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:33,339
- Did you ever think about you two...?
- Roz and me? Oh, no.

110
00:07:33,665 --> 00:07:35,895
Oh, come on! Never fantasised

111
00:07:36,168 --> 00:07:38,557
about stealing away
to a motel with her?

112
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:43,276
I'm a man with normal urges,
and she has a silk blouse

113
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:46,711
that opens a bit when she leans over
the cart rack, but...

114
00:07:47,019 --> 00:07:50,694
oh, mixing work with romance...
is it ever worth it?

115
00:07:51,026 --> 00:07:55,099
Don't ask me. You're the one
that looked down her blouse.

116
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:58,681
- Decaf zimbabwe latte.
- Is that non-fat milk?

117
00:07:58,998 --> 00:08:00,989
- No.
- I hate to be a bother.

118
00:08:01,252 --> 00:08:03,846
It's just that i'm watching my fat intake.

119
00:08:05,341 --> 00:08:07,093
Is that rain?

120
00:08:07,345 --> 00:08:10,940
- No, god is crying.
- Can't i ask a simple question?

121
00:08:11,268 --> 00:08:13,657
Do you ask any other kind?

122
00:08:15,442 --> 00:08:18,559
Hey, how the hell did she get a table?

123
00:08:19,907 --> 00:08:22,023
Oh, frasier, frasier! There!

124
00:08:23,371 --> 00:08:25,327
Oh!

125
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:28,051
- Frasier!
- Oh, niles, niles!

126
00:08:28,338 --> 00:08:30,488
Oh, good block!

127
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:32,954
Sorry!

128
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:35,176
Good work there.

129
00:08:35,433 --> 00:08:37,788
I just wanted it a little more than he did.

130
00:08:40,733 --> 00:08:42,963
Oh, boy, it's really coming down.

131
00:08:47,745 --> 00:08:49,497
What?

132
00:08:49,748 --> 00:08:51,864
Something happened
the other morning.

133
00:08:52,169 --> 00:08:56,003
I asked dad to pass me a bran muffin.
You know what he said?

134
00:08:56,342 --> 00:08:59,857
- He said, "what's the magic word?"
- You're kidding!

135
00:09:00,182 --> 00:09:03,379
He didn't find it amusing
when i said "rest home".

136
00:09:10,616 --> 00:09:15,895
Oh, oh, oh! Look, look!
That must be roz's coffee companion.

137
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:18,805
Wow, he's really handsome, isn't he?

138
00:09:19,088 --> 00:09:21,397
"Wow"? Did you say "wow"?

139
00:09:21,676 --> 00:09:23,632
Good lord, i did.

140
00:09:23,887 --> 00:09:27,436
I don't think i've ever said "wow"
describing another man before.

141
00:09:27,769 --> 00:09:29,760
Does that mean something?

142
00:09:30,022 --> 00:09:32,138
It means you're a gay man.

143
00:09:33,821 --> 00:09:37,018
Your life with maris is a charade.
Come out of the closet.

144
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:40,716
You want to tell dad or shall i?

145
00:09:42,501 --> 00:09:46,574
This was stupid!
This whole idea was stupid! Admit it.

146
00:09:46,925 --> 00:09:49,200
No! You needed exercise.

147
00:09:49,472 --> 00:09:52,509
It was stupid to come out
without your bumbershoot.

148
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:55,119
It's an umbrella! Speak english!

149
00:09:55,398 --> 00:09:57,354
Sorry, no dogs allowed.

150
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:00,522
- What?
- Oh, i'm sorry.

151
00:10:04,037 --> 00:10:05,789
It's ok.

152
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:09,750
- Oh, niles?
- Hello, dad.

153
00:10:10,089 --> 00:10:14,287
- What are you two doing here?
- I felt we needed some exercise.

154
00:10:14,638 --> 00:10:18,108
I had to pick up some beans anyway,
so we walked.

155
00:10:18,436 --> 00:10:20,870
Well, one of us
was dragged by his collar.

156
00:10:21,148 --> 00:10:25,426
I told you i didn't want to come.
Look at me, i'll die of pneumonia.

157
00:10:25,781 --> 00:10:28,500
You'll outlive us.
The cranky ones always do.

158
00:10:28,786 --> 00:10:33,143
Let's get you something hot to drink.
You want a cappuccino or...?

159
00:10:33,503 --> 00:10:37,018
- Can i help you?
- Coffee, black, nothing fancy in it.

160
00:10:37,342 --> 00:10:39,697
We have two special coffees today...

161
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:42,202
i'll surprise you.

162
00:10:44,729 --> 00:10:48,358
Oh, joy. There's nothing like
the smell of a wet dog

163
00:10:48,694 --> 00:10:50,650
to work up the appetite for supper.

164
00:10:52,033 --> 00:10:55,867
- We're soaked to the skin!
- You're in a fine mood today!

165
00:10:56,206 --> 00:10:58,879
- You left a mess in the kitchen.
- I had toast!

166
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:02,003
Yeah, and you buttered it
on the counter.

167
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:05,690
I know because you left
crumbs and toast sweat there!

168
00:11:06,015 --> 00:11:08,654
- Toast sweat?
- Yes, yes.

169
00:11:08,936 --> 00:11:13,214
When you put hot toast on any surface,
it leaves drops of dew.

170
00:11:13,569 --> 00:11:16,527
Haven't you heard dad's lecture
on the evils of toast sweat?

171
00:11:16,824 --> 00:11:19,657
It's the scourge of our times!

172
00:11:21,373 --> 00:11:23,125
One coffee, black.

173
00:11:25,213 --> 00:11:28,808
And a decaf, non-fat zimbabwe latte.

174
00:11:29,136 --> 00:11:31,570
Oh, dear,
is that cinnamon on that foam?

175
00:11:34,895 --> 00:11:38,012
As long as we're picking
each other's scabs here,

176
00:11:38,318 --> 00:11:41,196
i found eddie's chew toy
in my sweater cubby.

177
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:44,766
Hair all over my favourite pullover!
He sleeps in there!

178
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:47,752
Because you keep sweaters
in a "cubby".

179
00:11:48,042 --> 00:11:51,830
Oh! Well, my bedroom
is off-limits to this flea bag.

180
00:11:52,174 --> 00:11:54,768
- He's not a flea bag!
- How about those mariners?

181
00:11:55,053 --> 00:11:57,362
Shut up, niles!

182
00:11:57,641 --> 00:12:00,599
If my hip's good enough to get me here,

183
00:12:00,896 --> 00:12:03,854
maybe it's time
i found a place of my own!

184
00:12:04,152 --> 00:12:07,110
- Where will you go?
- Don't worry. I'll find a place.

185
00:12:07,408 --> 00:12:10,878
I've got a little money saved up.
I never wanted to move in with you.

186
00:12:11,205 --> 00:12:14,675
"i don't want
to be a burden to anybody!"

187
00:12:15,003 --> 00:12:18,200
That's frasier's smartass way
of telling me he's heard this.

188
00:12:18,509 --> 00:12:22,627
You won't have to hear it again.
Tell daphne to catch up with us.

189
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:27,253
We go through this melodrama
every week! Sit down!

190
00:12:27,608 --> 00:12:30,600
- No. How much for the coffee?
- $1.50.

191
00:12:30,905 --> 00:12:34,341
For coffee?
What kind of world are we living in?

192
00:12:42,089 --> 00:12:44,080
You were in that bathroom forever.

193
00:12:44,344 --> 00:12:48,895
I tried that damn hand cream.
I'm so oily, i couldn't grip the doorknob.

194
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:54,615
When some guy came in,
i said, "am i glad to see you!"

195
00:12:55,862 --> 00:12:59,252
I can't even begin to describe
the look he gave me.

196
00:13:04,167 --> 00:13:06,123
There it is.

197
00:13:09,093 --> 00:13:12,005
So, i'm told you and your dad
are at it again.

198
00:13:12,306 --> 00:13:14,262
What's new?

199
00:13:14,518 --> 00:13:18,511
Lately, he's had a face
as long as a wet weekend.

200
00:13:18,859 --> 00:13:21,817
Yesterday, when i insisted
he do his stretching exercises,

201
00:13:22,114 --> 00:13:25,265
he told me to stick me feet
behind me head and spin like a top.

202
00:13:25,578 --> 00:13:28,809
The best thing to do
is to ignore him when he's like that.

203
00:13:29,126 --> 00:13:32,243
Isn't that right, niles? Niles?

204
00:13:36,137 --> 00:13:39,493
I'm sorry. For some reason,
i'm feeling a little dizzy.

205
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:44,695
- I'll go after him.
- Oh, here.

206
00:13:45,903 --> 00:13:48,736
- Take my bumbershoot.
- That's nice.

207
00:13:49,034 --> 00:13:51,502
At least someone
appreciates my mother tongue.

208
00:13:51,787 --> 00:13:53,743
I've always had an ear for your tongue.

209
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,752
Oh, niles!

210
00:13:58,131 --> 00:14:00,122
What did i say?

211
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:06,147
- Want another coffee?
- Not until i've had my first one, thanks.

212
00:14:10,736 --> 00:14:13,967
Why is it always so difficult
between me and dad?

213
00:14:14,283 --> 00:14:16,433
Look at it from dad's point of view.

214
00:14:16,703 --> 00:14:20,059
As a policeman, he had authority.
That's been taken away.

215
00:14:20,377 --> 00:14:25,053
Criticising the world, he controls
his shrinking sphere of influence.

216
00:14:25,426 --> 00:14:28,384
I do empathise with him. It's just...

217
00:14:28,682 --> 00:14:32,994
i can't help wishing to kick that cane
out from under him sometimes

218
00:14:33,356 --> 00:14:35,916
and that he would land on eddie.

219
00:14:37,989 --> 00:14:41,698
- It's hard. I know you're trying.
- I am.

220
00:14:42,037 --> 00:14:44,471
Sometimes,
i see the fruits of my labour.

221
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:48,823
The other night, dad was watching tv.
I'd fallen asleep on the couch.

222
00:14:49,174 --> 00:14:52,166
Suddenly i stirred.
I felt something on my head.

223
00:14:52,471 --> 00:14:54,860
Dad was standing there,
stroking my hair.

224
00:14:55,142 --> 00:14:56,894
Dad?

225
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,732
Did he say anything?

226
00:14:59,984 --> 00:15:04,102
Yeah, he said, "don't you think it's time
for a haircut? You look like bozo."

227
00:15:05,994 --> 00:15:08,713
I know he was covering.
What do you think?

228
00:15:08,998 --> 00:15:12,513
- Wouldn't hurt to get a trim.
- No...

229
00:15:12,838 --> 00:15:16,547
- do you think he was covering?
- Of course. You know dad.

230
00:15:16,887 --> 00:15:21,199
Tough as nails on the outside,
but on the inside, one giant spike.

231
00:15:23,564 --> 00:15:26,124
- Grazie.
- Excuse me. What about mine?

232
00:15:26,402 --> 00:15:29,280
We have a team of specialists
working on it.

233
00:15:34,624 --> 00:15:38,663
Let's change the subject from dad
and talk about something else.

234
00:15:39,006 --> 00:15:43,477
- Yes, about something light and frothy.
- I agree.

235
00:15:43,847 --> 00:15:45,963
Are you in love with daphne?

236
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:52,591
That's a little frothier than i had in mind.

237
00:15:54,323 --> 00:15:59,033
That is preposterous! I refuse
to dignify that question with an answer.

238
00:16:04,256 --> 00:16:07,532
I don't know.
There, i said it! Are you happy?

239
00:16:07,846 --> 00:16:11,361
Why did you have to hire
venus herself?

240
00:16:11,685 --> 00:16:16,679
Why not a beefy, eastern-european
scrubwoman who reeked of ammonia?

241
00:16:18,905 --> 00:16:22,580
I asked, but it was an olympic year.
The agency was fresh out.

242
00:16:28,796 --> 00:16:31,833
Frasier, i can't get her out of my mind.

243
00:16:32,135 --> 00:16:36,572
Daphne stirs a passion in me
i've never known before.

244
00:16:36,935 --> 00:16:41,053
- You're not considering leaving maris?
- No.

245
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,834
I suppose the situation you're in is

246
00:16:44,113 --> 00:16:48,106
that you'd like to stay with maris
but have an affair with daphne.

247
00:16:48,454 --> 00:16:51,287
- Yes. Can i do that?
- No, you can't.

248
00:16:55,341 --> 00:17:00,096
I thought that i couldn't, but you
got my hopes up there for a minute.

249
00:17:00,474 --> 00:17:04,023
Oh, it's easy for you.
You're free, you're happy.

250
00:17:04,355 --> 00:17:06,869
You haven't answered
that question yet.

251
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:10,985
- I haven't?
- No, you haven't. Are you happy?

252
00:17:11,325 --> 00:17:15,637
Well, i guess the best way
i could think of saying it is...

253
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,515
- this sucks.
- What's the matter?

254
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,956
You're having coffee
with a man and think he might

255
00:17:23,303 --> 00:17:28,252
lead you to something like,
oh, i don't know, a life?

256
00:17:28,645 --> 00:17:33,844
Suddenly, the trapdoor opens
and you're right back in roz's world.

257
00:17:34,238 --> 00:17:36,752
- How did it go so wrong so quickly?
- Simple.

258
00:17:37,035 --> 00:17:39,151
He just wanted to convert me.

259
00:17:39,413 --> 00:17:44,931
I have nothing against religious people.
I'm ecumenical.

260
00:17:45,339 --> 00:17:47,807
I embrace men of all faiths.

261
00:17:49,972 --> 00:17:52,691
If only it stopped there.

262
00:17:55,815 --> 00:17:59,569
He pretended it was a date. Isn't there
a commandment against that?

263
00:17:59,905 --> 00:18:03,978
No, they didn't go into dating
until the new testament.

264
00:18:04,329 --> 00:18:06,923
Roz, i'm sorry. Why don't you join us?

265
00:18:07,209 --> 00:18:11,885
No, thank you. There's a cute
new handyman in my building.

266
00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:16,810
I'll just go home, slip into a negligee
and rip out my faucet.

267
00:18:18,728 --> 00:18:21,640
You think she's kidding, don't you?

268
00:18:23,361 --> 00:18:27,240
I think about roz's life,
and it makes me wonder about my own.

269
00:18:29,871 --> 00:18:32,669
I haven't been exactly
burning up the social scene lately.

270
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,032
- You'll find somebody.
- But what if i don't?

271
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:39,457
What if i end up old and alone?

272
00:18:39,762 --> 00:18:44,756
I might have to buy a funny little dog
and move in with frederick.

273
00:18:45,147 --> 00:18:47,581
I don't have to worry
about that for a while.

274
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:50,579
No. Frederick should worry about that.

275
00:18:53,118 --> 00:18:57,396
You might try answering
my original question: Are you happy?

276
00:18:57,751 --> 00:18:59,946
I guess i'd have to say...

277
00:19:00,213 --> 00:19:02,602
- hello, boys.
- Oh, for pete's sake.

278
00:19:02,884 --> 00:19:06,923
- Dad, what are you doing back here?
- I don't know, i...

279
00:19:07,266 --> 00:19:12,818
i've been acting like a jerk lately,
and taking it out on you and daphne.

280
00:19:13,234 --> 00:19:15,794
All that stuff i said earlier,
forget about it.

281
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:19,701
- I already have.
- Come on, eddie.

282
00:19:20,038 --> 00:19:25,032
Dad, listen, has something been
bothering you the last few days?

283
00:19:25,421 --> 00:19:27,616
- No, no.
- Come on.

284
00:19:27,884 --> 00:19:29,920
- Nothing.
- Is something bothering you?

285
00:19:30,179 --> 00:19:32,613
- Just tell us.
- Just say it.

286
00:19:33,852 --> 00:19:35,808
Ok.

287
00:19:36,064 --> 00:19:38,862
Last sunday was my birthday.

288
00:19:42,366 --> 00:19:46,917
Of course it was. Frasier and i
planned a big surprise party,

289
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:50,088
but on your birthday
it wouldn't have been a surprise.

290
00:19:50,379 --> 00:19:53,610
Thus we waited a week.
So, surprise!

291
00:19:56,722 --> 00:19:59,077
Oh, if you could see
the look on your face.

292
00:20:00,312 --> 00:20:04,225
Just give it up, niles.
Dad, i'm sorry.

293
00:20:04,569 --> 00:20:06,924
- Oh, no.
- Come and have a seat.

294
00:20:07,198 --> 00:20:10,156
You know, i don't know
why i let it bother me.

295
00:20:10,454 --> 00:20:15,130
All those years on the force,
i missed enough of your birthdays.

296
00:20:15,504 --> 00:20:21,500
You know what? We can still celebrate.
We'll take you out to dinner tonight.

297
00:20:21,931 --> 00:20:25,162
- You don't need to do that.
- Absolutely. You name the place.

298
00:20:25,479 --> 00:20:27,231
Ok.

299
00:20:27,482 --> 00:20:32,237
- How about hoppy's old heidelberg?
- Oh, great! Great!

300
00:20:32,616 --> 00:20:35,255
They were voted
best bratwurst in town.

301
00:20:35,537 --> 00:20:37,493
Ach du lieber!

302
00:20:39,335 --> 00:20:42,054
I've been on third street
looking for you.

303
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:46,379
I was on fourth street.
Eddie had smelled everything on third.

304
00:20:46,722 --> 00:20:50,795
- How did you know i was here?
- One of me psychic flashes.

305
00:20:51,146 --> 00:20:54,536
Bang! There you were walking
into café nervosa.

306
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:58,057
You were apologising for the way
you've treated me this week.

307
00:20:58,366 --> 00:21:01,438
I'm sorry about that.
Just forget about it, all right?

308
00:21:01,747 --> 00:21:05,535
And something about a raise...

309
00:21:07,047 --> 00:21:09,925
- you're winging it now.
- Am i that transparent?

310
00:21:10,219 --> 00:21:12,574
No, i'm psychic.

311
00:21:12,849 --> 00:21:17,604
The boys are taking us out
to hoppy's old heidelberg for dinner.

312
00:21:17,982 --> 00:21:20,371
Oh, great. German food!

313
00:21:20,653 --> 00:21:25,773
We whip the jerries twice this century,
and they still have the last laugh.

314
00:21:26,162 --> 00:21:27,914
Dad, sorry, i can't give you a ride.

315
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:31,309
- I'll give him a lift.
- Ah.

316
00:21:32,423 --> 00:21:35,859
I've enjoyed
getting together with you for coffee.

317
00:21:36,179 --> 00:21:40,377
- What do you talk about all the time?
- Sports, chicks, monster truck rallies.

318
00:21:40,728 --> 00:21:43,083
Ok, don't tell me.

319
00:21:45,736 --> 00:21:51,094
Zimbabwe, decaf, non-fat milk,
no cinnamon in sight. Now...

320
00:21:51,495 --> 00:21:53,213
are you happy?

321
00:21:55,794 --> 00:22:00,584
You know, in the greater
scheme of things, yes, i'd say i am.

322
00:22:12,906 --> 00:22:16,979
# Baby, i hear the blues a-calling
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

323
00:22:18,582 --> 00:22:19,810
# quite stylish

324
00:22:20,042 --> 00:22:25,719
# and maybe i seem a bit confused
well, maybe... but i got you pegged!

325
00:22:27,221 --> 00:22:30,896
# But i don't know what to do with those
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

326
00:22:33,106 --> 00:22:35,415
# they're calling again #

327
00:22:35,694 --> 00:22:38,413
see you next year! We love you!
