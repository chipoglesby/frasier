1
00:00:07,595 --> 00:00:09,347
 

2
00:00:09,598 --> 00:00:12,431
'I've tried diet after diet

3
00:00:12,729 --> 00:00:18,247
'from milk shakes three times a day
to that lady on tv. Nothing works.'

4
00:00:18,655 --> 00:00:23,206
Hank, listen.
You've got to look inside yourself.

5
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,140
Part of you isn't being fed.

6
00:00:26,418 --> 00:00:28,329
'It certainly isn't my butt.'

7
00:00:30,341 --> 00:00:35,131
I'm talking about your inner self.
What isn't being fed there?

8
00:00:35,516 --> 00:00:39,714
Love? Career? Simple self-esteem?
These are deep issues.

9
00:00:40,066 --> 00:00:43,979
- 'So what do i do? '
- I'd suggest therapy.

10
00:00:44,323 --> 00:00:48,111
Stay on the line
and my producer will help you.

11
00:00:48,454 --> 00:00:50,445
Roz, who's next?

12
00:00:50,708 --> 00:00:53,586
We have someone who disagrees
with your advice to hank.

13
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,678
Oh, really?
Hello, you're on the line.

14
00:00:56,968 --> 00:01:00,483
'congratulations, frasier,
you've done it again.'

15
00:01:09,864 --> 00:01:11,775
'You've led another
unsuspecting innocent

16
00:01:12,035 --> 00:01:14,913
'down one of your dark,
freudian hallways.'

17
00:01:18,087 --> 00:01:20,237
Lilith?

18
00:01:20,507 --> 00:01:24,978
'Overeating is a behavioural problem
caused by negative reinforcement.

19
00:01:25,348 --> 00:01:28,260
'It can be cured
by behaviour modification.'

20
00:01:28,563 --> 00:01:33,353
Seattle, we have a celebrity
of sorts on the line.

21
00:01:33,738 --> 00:01:35,694
This is my ex-wife lilith.

22
00:01:35,949 --> 00:01:37,905
'What do you mean by celebrity? '

23
00:01:38,162 --> 00:01:40,232
Oh, they know you.

24
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:46,598
Roz, what does "call screening" mean?

25
00:01:46,884 --> 00:01:49,273
I put on the air the calls i wanna hear.

26
00:01:52,226 --> 00:01:55,502
Lilith, what brings you to seattle?
The constant rain?

27
00:01:56,567 --> 00:01:59,957
'I'm here for a convention
and i heard you on the radio.

28
00:02:00,281 --> 00:02:03,239
'I hoped you'd introduce
pearl jam's latest hit,

29
00:02:03,536 --> 00:02:07,085
'but you were doling out
worthless advice pellets

30
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:11,017
'from your psychiatric pez dispenser.'

31
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:16,098
I guess you'll be rushing off
to your convention.

32
00:02:16,391 --> 00:02:18,507
We'll catch up on your next trip.

33
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:20,806
'I'm not doing anything
for dinner tonight.'

34
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:27,684
Then you'll want to keep tuned to 780
for gil chesterton's restaurant beat.

35
00:02:28,077 --> 00:02:31,672
Why don't you ask her to dinner,
dr crane?

36
00:02:35,172 --> 00:02:39,723
What a wonderful idea.
Let me tell you why, seattle.

37
00:02:40,097 --> 00:02:42,167
Although our marriage
was unsuccessful,

38
00:02:42,434 --> 00:02:46,552
lilith and i are capable
of behaving as adults

39
00:02:46,899 --> 00:02:50,938
and even enjoying spending
some time together from time to time.

40
00:02:51,282 --> 00:02:56,072
- So, 7.00 at my place?
- 'Sounds great.'

41
00:03:05,263 --> 00:03:09,381
In my day, when people broke up
you hated each other.

42
00:03:09,729 --> 00:03:13,085
What happened
to the sanctity of divorce?

43
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:16,633
- Dad, you never liked lilith.
- She's weird.

44
00:03:19,244 --> 00:03:22,554
- She is not weird.
- Oh, she's weird.

45
00:03:24,128 --> 00:03:26,198
Well, maybe she's a little strange.

46
00:03:26,465 --> 00:03:30,140
No. Maris is a little strange.
Lilith is weird.

47
00:03:30,472 --> 00:03:33,703
Gee, dad. I had no idea
you preferred my wife to frasier's.

48
00:03:36,398 --> 00:03:38,389
Oh, my head!

49
00:03:38,652 --> 00:03:41,530
- Can i get you an aspirin, daphne?
- No, those are useless.

50
00:03:41,824 --> 00:03:46,534
This is one of my psychic headaches.
There's some kind of negative force.

51
00:03:46,915 --> 00:03:50,510
I get these when there's
a clawing at the cosmic continuum.

52
00:03:50,839 --> 00:03:52,989
Perhaps if someone
rubbed your temples...

53
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:55,137
niles!

54
00:03:57,057 --> 00:04:00,208
I'm sure she wants privacy
while she contacts the mother ship.

55
00:04:04,987 --> 00:04:09,185
Frasier, i'm here for support
but i will not speak to lilith.

56
00:04:09,536 --> 00:04:14,087
This feud between you and lilith
is ridiculous. Let it go.

57
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:18,373
- I can't recall what the fight was about.
- Let me refresh you.

58
00:04:21,181 --> 00:04:24,491
At our wedding
while maris was reciting her vows -

59
00:04:24,811 --> 00:04:27,803
vows of love - i heard snickering.

60
00:04:30,362 --> 00:04:34,480
I saw lilith, fingers pressed against
her lips, body shaking like a paint mixer.

61
00:04:34,828 --> 00:04:36,546
 

62
00:04:36,789 --> 00:04:39,303
Now there she is.

63
00:04:39,586 --> 00:04:43,181
It's just one evening.
Will you at least try to be civil?

64
00:04:43,508 --> 00:04:45,976
All right, but i refuse to be warm.

65
00:04:54,193 --> 00:04:56,184
- Hello, lilith.
- Frasier

66
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:58,563
please come in.

67
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:07,383
- Let me take these things for you.
- Thank you.

68
00:05:07,715 --> 00:05:10,548
- Look who's here.
- Hello, martin. Hello, niles.

69
00:05:10,845 --> 00:05:12,801
hello.

70
00:05:14,936 --> 00:05:18,087
- Where's maris?
- Visiting her sister in chicago.

71
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:23,997
I thought perhaps she was sailing
up the transplendent river of your love.

72
00:05:28,709 --> 00:05:32,668
Frasier, i like your apartment.
You have some beautiful things.

73
00:05:33,007 --> 00:05:35,567
The settlement is final, lilith.

74
00:05:40,853 --> 00:05:43,242
Go away.

75
00:05:45,778 --> 00:05:47,973
Why does he listen to you and not me?

76
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,277
The tone of my voice means business.

77
00:05:51,579 --> 00:05:54,298
Your voice
is more commanding than mine?

78
00:05:54,584 --> 00:05:57,974
Hell, i took a half a step before
i realized she was talking to the dog.

79
00:06:10,694 --> 00:06:13,970
Oh, my lord.
I've never had a throbbing like this.

80
00:06:14,283 --> 00:06:17,434
Daphne, this is my ex-wife,
dr lilith sternin.

81
00:06:17,747 --> 00:06:21,740
Lilith, this is daphne moon,
dad's physical therapist.

82
00:06:22,088 --> 00:06:24,761
- Nice to meet you.
- An equal pleasure.

83
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:28,441
When i shook hands
i lost all feeling in me arm.

84
00:06:31,938 --> 00:06:34,088
Frasier, i'm going to use the phone.

85
00:06:34,358 --> 00:06:37,873
Maris has a cold.
I want to be sure she's taking liquids.

86
00:06:38,198 --> 00:06:40,712
Isn't it enough
that she's eternally sipping

87
00:06:40,994 --> 00:06:43,508
from the font
of your perpetual adoration?

88
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,991
Martin, i'm especially delighted
to see you here tonight.

89
00:06:54,308 --> 00:06:56,060
Oh, yeah?

90
00:06:56,311 --> 00:06:59,428
Knowing the history
of your relationship with frasier,

91
00:06:59,734 --> 00:07:01,804
when i'd heard he'd taken you in

92
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:05,346
i flipped to the weather channel
to see if hell had frozen over.

93
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,356
Frasier, how did you ever
let this little peach get away?

94
00:07:15,801 --> 00:07:19,476
Dinner is nearly ready.
Let's move to the table.

95
00:07:19,808 --> 00:07:22,242
Lilith, how is frederick?

96
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:26,718
I've enrolled him in a chess camp.
It's really quite stimulating.

97
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:30,824
For eight hours a day
he sits with 300 other children

98
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,628
mastering the alhausen-grob opening.

99
00:07:33,915 --> 00:07:36,793
Shouldn't he be out in the fresh air?

100
00:07:37,087 --> 00:07:39,078
Every day they go for a nature walk.

101
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:43,804
Unfortunately, frederick is allergic
to seven varieties of ivy

102
00:07:44,139 --> 00:07:47,336
so he wears long sleeves
and long pants,

103
00:07:47,646 --> 00:07:49,602
a bonnet with a net on it.

104
00:07:51,694 --> 00:07:54,128
I hope the others don't make fun of him.

105
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:58,685
I'm sure they don't.
You know how kind kids can be (!)

106
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,714
All he needs is a birthmark on his
face and they'd beat him to death.

107
00:08:08,596 --> 00:08:10,791
I chased him down an alley,

108
00:08:11,059 --> 00:08:15,655
then he pulled a knife so i gave
him a few shots from my night stick.

109
00:08:16,026 --> 00:08:18,096
Fascinating.

110
00:08:18,363 --> 00:08:21,321
Were you at all aware
of any repressed sexual urges

111
00:08:21,618 --> 00:08:25,452
while you were pummelling him
so mercilessly?

112
00:08:26,752 --> 00:08:29,266
Yeah, but i didn't put them in the report.

113
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:34,650
You're having fun at my expense.

114
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,887
Not much.

115
00:08:38,313 --> 00:08:41,510
- In fact, i'm going to bed. Good night.
- Good night, dad.

116
00:08:41,818 --> 00:08:44,935
If you don't need me
i'll be shuffling off, too.

117
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,992
Good night.

118
00:08:47,243 --> 00:08:51,634
It was a pleasure meeting you.
How long are you staying in seattle?

119
00:08:52,002 --> 00:08:54,038
Just the weekend.

120
00:08:54,297 --> 00:08:58,336
Enjoy your stay.
I'll be dead by saturday night.

121
00:08:59,973 --> 00:09:03,045
I'll say my goodbyes as well.

122
00:09:05,565 --> 00:09:07,874
Good night, frasier.

123
00:09:08,153 --> 00:09:10,621
This is ridiculous!

124
00:09:10,908 --> 00:09:15,265
Lilith, listen, niles is upset because
you snickered at maris' wedding vows.

125
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:20,652
I responded with a spontaneous
emotion i was feeling at the time.

126
00:09:21,968 --> 00:09:25,677
But if niles is not mature enough
to accept that,

127
00:09:26,016 --> 00:09:31,648
if he is so pitifully insecure,
if he is in such need of validation,

128
00:09:32,068 --> 00:09:34,536
then for some sense
of familial harmony,

129
00:09:34,822 --> 00:09:37,017
i do apologize.

130
00:09:38,287 --> 00:09:42,075
Oh, lilith, thank you! Thank you!

131
00:09:42,418 --> 00:09:45,649
This bad blood between us
has gone on too long.

132
00:09:47,217 --> 00:09:51,415
Next time you're in town,
we'll have dinner - just you and me.

133
00:09:54,063 --> 00:09:57,135
He doesn't get that kind
of validation at home, you see.

134
00:10:01,533 --> 00:10:04,684
Well... it's just the two of us.

135
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:09,431
For the first time since the lawyers
put us in that room and said,

136
00:10:09,755 --> 00:10:11,905
"don't come out
until there's some resolution."

137
00:10:15,765 --> 00:10:18,962
Yes, well... this was nice.

138
00:10:20,356 --> 00:10:22,506
Yes, it was, wasn't it?

139
00:10:25,656 --> 00:10:28,170
You have a beautiful view.

140
00:10:28,452 --> 00:10:30,408
It's a beautiful city.

141
00:10:30,665 --> 00:10:33,259
I hope you enjoy your convention.

142
00:10:34,462 --> 00:10:37,772
For god's sake, frasier,
there is no convention!

143
00:10:38,093 --> 00:10:40,891
- I'm here because of the letter.
- What letter?

144
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:44,447
You know very well what letter.

145
00:10:44,729 --> 00:10:48,563
The one you left last month
when you visited frederick,

146
00:10:48,903 --> 00:10:51,292
proposing we get back together.

147
00:10:51,574 --> 00:10:53,690
Surely you didn't forget.

148
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:58,708
"My darling, how could a love
like ours fall so far from grace?

149
00:10:59,086 --> 00:11:03,955
"Part of your heart must still
resound to the rhythm of my own.

150
00:11:04,345 --> 00:11:06,620
"I'll be lost without you.

151
00:11:06,891 --> 00:11:10,566
"As long as we have love,
love will keep us together."

152
00:11:12,567 --> 00:11:15,525
Aside from the shameless pilfering
from the captain and tennille,

153
00:11:15,822 --> 00:11:18,620
i was moved by your entreaty.

154
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:25,450
I felt the same, yet i needed to
pretend to come for a convention

155
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,912
because i was still
unable to commit myself.

156
00:11:31,723 --> 00:11:34,999
But... seeing you now,

157
00:11:35,313 --> 00:11:37,304
i realize how much i've missed you

158
00:11:42,658 --> 00:11:47,448
lilith, i did write that letter
and i did leave it in the apartment but...

159
00:11:49,002 --> 00:11:50,993
yes?

160
00:11:51,256 --> 00:11:54,612
It wasn't last month.
It was nearly a year ago.

161
00:11:54,928 --> 00:11:58,284
It was before i moved to seattle.
You just found it now?

162
00:11:59,895 --> 00:12:02,090
It had fallen behind the dresser.

163
00:12:02,357 --> 00:12:06,794
The cleaning service
is doing its usual bang-up job

164
00:12:07,157 --> 00:12:10,035
- Don't i feel like the perfect fool?
- Listen, lilith...

165
00:12:10,328 --> 00:12:13,718
i am humiliated, emotionally drained

166
00:12:14,043 --> 00:12:17,479
and i've used up
all my frequent-flyer miles.

167
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:20,836
Lilith, please...
- there's nothing else to say.

168
00:12:21,138 --> 00:12:24,687
I'd like to leave
with at least a shred of dignity.

169
00:12:40,754 --> 00:12:43,427
 

170
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:51,452
Thank you.

171
00:12:53,441 --> 00:12:56,911
I wrote this letter
just before i came to seattle

172
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:01,358
hoping for a reconciliation.
She only just found it.

173
00:13:01,705 --> 00:13:03,935
Didn't captain and tennille sing this?

174
00:13:04,209 --> 00:13:06,484
Like they own those five words!

175
00:13:08,216 --> 00:13:11,811
I got over her, i moved out here,

176
00:13:12,139 --> 00:13:15,688
she comes back and i wonder
if i made the right decision.

177
00:13:16,062 --> 00:13:18,622
I did write that letter.

178
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,289
You have come
to some sort of crossroads.

179
00:13:21,572 --> 00:13:25,850
That's a tidy little way
of saying i'm in hell.

180
00:13:28,499 --> 00:13:31,138
Niles, my life suits me,

181
00:13:31,421 --> 00:13:34,493
yet i wonder if there is
a chance for reconciliation,

182
00:13:34,801 --> 00:13:38,589
if it's worth exploring
the feelings that i'm feeling.

183
00:13:40,728 --> 00:13:42,958
Should i see her tonight?

184
00:13:44,651 --> 00:13:49,247
Like most patients
you know the answer to your question.

185
00:13:49,618 --> 00:13:53,497
You want me to support you
whether i share your opinion or not.

186
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,744
- I don't have an opinion.
- You do.

187
00:13:56,003 --> 00:13:58,517
- But i don't.
- Then i can't help you.

188
00:14:03,224 --> 00:14:05,863
All right. All right.

189
00:14:06,145 --> 00:14:10,343
In my soul, i'm leaning
toward taking the next step

190
00:14:10,694 --> 00:14:14,004
and seeing if there's anything... there.

191
00:14:14,325 --> 00:14:16,714
- That is what you should do.
- Why?

192
00:14:16,996 --> 00:14:19,066
- You know why.
- Damn it, niles!

193
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:22,291
Frasier, you know why.

194
00:14:23,632 --> 00:14:25,509
All right.

195
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:30,675
We have a long history together.
We have a son we both adore.

196
00:14:31,061 --> 00:14:35,134
There were some good times,
and when they were good, whoo-wa!

197
00:14:37,488 --> 00:14:40,366
Our minds are pretty well made up.

198
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:44,255
Thank you, niles.
I don't know what i'd do without you.

199
00:14:44,584 --> 00:14:46,734
- Yes, you do.
- Drop it!

200
00:14:52,555 --> 00:14:54,591
 

201
00:15:00,234 --> 00:15:02,589
- Hello, lilith.
- Frasier, come in.

202
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:06,459
I must be early.
You haven't put up your hair.

203
00:15:06,745 --> 00:15:11,102
- I thought i'd leave it down.
- Really?

204
00:15:12,128 --> 00:15:16,406
After several hours of deliberation
and weighing the consequences,

205
00:15:16,762 --> 00:15:19,560
i decided to be playful.

206
00:15:22,479 --> 00:15:24,947
I'm glad you invited me to dinner.

207
00:15:25,233 --> 00:15:28,828
How could i not?
I felt so awful about last night.

208
00:15:29,157 --> 00:15:32,991
I thought you'd read the letter
long ago and ignored it.

209
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:37,482
No explanation necessary.
It was a simple misunderstanding.

210
00:15:37,837 --> 00:15:40,670
Well,
i know a great little french bistro...

211
00:15:40,968 --> 00:15:43,766
frasier, before we go anywhere,

212
00:15:44,056 --> 00:15:48,652
i'd like to go on record as saying
that, regardless of everything,

213
00:15:49,022 --> 00:15:52,298
i respect you for getting on
with your life so successfully.

214
00:15:54,073 --> 00:15:57,622
I feel the same way about you.

215
00:15:57,954 --> 00:16:01,913
Frederick is flourishing
and that's in no small part due to you.

216
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:05,689
Thank you.
That means a great deal to me.

217
00:16:06,885 --> 00:16:11,003
That's the first pleasant thing we've
said to each other in almost a year.

218
00:16:11,351 --> 00:16:16,823
- You're right.
- You know, i'm suddenly quite moved.

219
00:16:18,947 --> 00:16:21,780
I am, too.

220
00:16:23,371 --> 00:16:27,410
Would it be a dreadful contretemps
if i kissed you right now?

221
00:16:27,754 --> 00:16:30,222
You can always try.

222
00:16:43,529 --> 00:16:45,520
You wanna bag dinner?

223
00:16:45,783 --> 00:16:49,173
There's a bed and an honour bar.
What more do we need?

224
00:16:49,498 --> 00:16:53,969
- Come to me, my white-hot flame.
- I was insane to divorce you.

225
00:16:54,339 --> 00:16:56,295
You're in my thoughts
every waking hour.

226
00:16:56,550 --> 00:17:00,225
- You're the only man i've ever loved.
- So are you.

227
00:17:30,565 --> 00:17:32,521
Good morning.

228
00:17:33,863 --> 00:17:36,900
Jolly good morning to you, too.

229
00:17:37,201 --> 00:17:39,954
I could stay like this all morning.

230
00:17:40,248 --> 00:17:42,557
Me too.

231
00:17:44,296 --> 00:17:48,494
- I'm so glad i flew here to be with you.
- Yes, me too.

232
00:17:49,555 --> 00:17:51,147
 

233
00:17:51,391 --> 00:17:53,825
I'll get that.

234
00:17:54,104 --> 00:17:57,699
It must be the breakfast we ordered
last night. I am famished.

235
00:17:58,027 --> 00:18:00,416
You should be. You were a busy boy.

236
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:09,419
- Good morning, sir.
- Just bring it in.

237
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:12,432
Here's something for you too.

238
00:18:12,718 --> 00:18:15,710
Thank you. Good day.

239
00:18:17,434 --> 00:18:22,827
Funny how life takes
its little turns, isn't it?

240
00:18:23,236 --> 00:18:28,230
Yesterday when i woke up i never
imagined i'd wake up here today.

241
00:18:28,619 --> 00:18:30,575
Indeed.

242
00:18:32,501 --> 00:18:37,211
We weren't overly impulsive,
we weren't wrong. It's just...

243
00:18:37,592 --> 00:18:41,710
- this is a mistake.
- Thank god you said that!

244
00:18:42,058 --> 00:18:44,652
Last night was enjoyable
but who are we kidding?

245
00:18:44,938 --> 00:18:50,729
We've gotten on with our lives.
I've got a new set of friends.

246
00:18:51,157 --> 00:18:53,352
For the first time in years i'm happy.

247
00:18:53,618 --> 00:18:57,406
Getting back together
is the stupidest thing we could do.

248
00:18:58,836 --> 00:19:01,908
I meant the eggs.
I ordered poached, not fried.

249
00:19:04,971 --> 00:19:08,327
Well, you didn't let me finish.
You see, um...

250
00:19:09,729 --> 00:19:11,799
after i play devil's advocate, i...

251
00:19:12,065 --> 00:19:15,660
oh, frasier. Don't insult me.
That's how you really feel, isn't it?

252
00:19:18,201 --> 00:19:20,112
I'm afraid so.

253
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:24,396
Oh, lilith, are you crying?

254
00:19:25,588 --> 00:19:27,624
God, i'm sorry.

255
00:19:27,884 --> 00:19:32,241
Once again, i've led you down
an emotional primrose path.

256
00:19:33,894 --> 00:19:37,523
Lilith... i never meant to hurt you.

257
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:41,784
I don't blame you if you're mad at me.

258
00:19:42,074 --> 00:19:45,464
I'm not mad at you. I'm mad at me.

259
00:19:46,665 --> 00:19:49,862
I don't even know what i'm doing here.

260
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:52,126
I've been so ionely,

261
00:19:52,383 --> 00:19:55,978
and your letter was like a life preserver.

262
00:19:57,850 --> 00:20:00,922
I'm raising a child alone.

263
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:03,824
I'm scared.

264
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:07,546
I've always thought of myself
as a strong person,

265
00:20:07,867 --> 00:20:09,778
but the truth is, i'm afraid.

266
00:20:10,036 --> 00:20:13,995
That's why i convinced myself
i was still in love with you.

267
00:20:14,335 --> 00:20:16,166
You mean you're not?

268
00:20:16,422 --> 00:20:19,175
No. I'm not.

269
00:20:22,182 --> 00:20:26,175
Good. So what happened was
because you were ionely and i was...

270
00:20:26,522 --> 00:20:28,399
we all know what you were, frasier.

271
00:20:32,365 --> 00:20:34,560
 

272
00:20:34,827 --> 00:20:37,580
Oh, lilith. Lilith, here. Here.
Come with me.

273
00:20:38,834 --> 00:20:42,270
Look in there. Tell me what you see.

274
00:20:43,383 --> 00:20:48,173
I'll tell you what i see...
the same strong-willed,

275
00:20:48,558 --> 00:20:51,516
dynamic, intelligent woman
i married seven years ago.

276
00:20:51,814 --> 00:20:55,409
You're suffering a temporary lapse.
Divorce does that to you.

277
00:20:57,824 --> 00:21:02,102
I won't say anything as trite
as someday you'll find someone,

278
00:21:02,456 --> 00:21:06,165
but i know this.
I know you.

279
00:21:06,505 --> 00:21:11,579
I know that no matter what
the future holds, you'll handle it.

280
00:21:16,354 --> 00:21:18,231
Thank you, frasier.

281
00:21:18,482 --> 00:21:20,518
- You hungry?
- Yeah.

282
00:21:20,778 --> 00:21:22,734
Ok.

283
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:27,522
You always knew
how to buck me up when i was blue.

284
00:21:27,832 --> 00:21:30,949
You've helped me
through some hard times yourself.

285
00:21:31,254 --> 00:21:35,167
Those married years weren't all bad.
We did have some good moments.

286
00:21:35,511 --> 00:21:37,467
The best one was frederick.

287
00:21:39,309 --> 00:21:41,459
We'll always have that.

288
00:21:43,816 --> 00:21:48,526
And you know, even though
we're not in love any more,

289
00:21:49,784 --> 00:21:52,935
you were always
the most exciting lover i ever had.

290
00:21:53,248 --> 00:21:56,126
In your heart of hearts
you'd say the same about me.

291
00:22:03,097 --> 00:22:06,089
They screwed up the toast, too.
I ordered rye.

292
00:22:06,395 --> 00:22:08,989
Lilith.

293
00:22:13,323 --> 00:22:18,841
# Hey, baby, i hear the blues a-calling
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

294
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:20,319
# oh, my!

295
00:22:20,794 --> 00:22:25,310
# And maybe i seem a bit confused
well, maybe... but i got you pegged!

296
00:22:27,638 --> 00:22:32,507
# But i don't know what to do with those
tossed salad and scrambled eggs

297
00:22:32,897 --> 00:22:34,853
# they're calling again #

298
00:22:35,109 --> 00:22:36,747
good night!
