1
00:00:08,049 --> 00:00:12,884
Remember, cosmetic surgery
is only a superficial solution.'

2
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:18,132
It can lift eyelids, but not the little cloud
of pessimism hovering over you.

3
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:21,677
Thank you for your call.

4
00:00:21,938 --> 00:00:24,088
Ok, roz, so who's our next caller?

5
00:00:25,066 --> 00:00:26,818
Roz?

6
00:00:27,068 --> 00:00:30,140
This'd be a good time
to go to commercial break.

7
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:32,563
We'll be right back
after these messages.

8
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:50,019
- Frasier?
- Hello.

9
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:53,435
Disturbing seeing no one there?

10
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:58,191
I was finding out if they've announced
the nominations for the seabs.

11
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:00,435
I forgot, are those out today?

12
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:03,597
You forgot?
The biggest award in seattle radio!

13
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:06,491
I suppose it's the difference in our ages.

14
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:08,970
I don't get excited about...

15
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:11,430
well, much anymore.

16
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:13,493
Congratulations.

17
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,618
- Yes! Yes! We got the nomination!
- Who'd you hear it from?

18
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:21,347
I haven't. I was congratulating
you on a great show.

19
00:01:21,706 --> 00:01:25,585
If anyone deserves a nomination,
you guys do.

20
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:32,084
- Get out, noel.
- Ok, catch you later.

21
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:38,428
Well, i guess i'm a little more
excited than i let on!

22
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:45,048
- It'd be a feather in my cap to win.
- Are you kidding?! In ten years,

23
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:47,315
i've never produced
a show that got nominated.

24
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:48,520
 

25
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:52,006
Hello... hi, millie... you're kidding!

26
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:57,053
- That's great! Thanks, bye.
- We got the nomination?

27
00:01:57,367 --> 00:02:01,155
- No, millie's getting married.
- Damn it, roz!

28
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:08,947
She said she'd been seeing someone
else - couldn't keep living a lie.

29
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:11,089
I was dumbfounded.

30
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:14,172
What about everything
we'd gone through?

31
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:16,423
Didn't that mean anything?

32
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:21,103
Niles, a patient has a right
to change therapists.

33
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:26,555
- Frasier, thank god!
- What're you doing here?

34
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:28,811
What kind of agent would i be

35
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:31,260
if i didn't tell you
you've been nominated?!

36
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:34,245
i was nominated!

37
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:36,645
Ha-ha!

38
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:40,550
Well... i was!

39
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:45,271
Yes, you... frasier crane,
md, phd, stud,

40
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:47,659
are the man of the hour!

41
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:51,166
Bebe glazer, frasier's agent.

42
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,889
Dr niles crane, frasier's brother.

43
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,972
- You're not a psychiatrist, too?
- Yes.

44
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:01,890
Oh, please, if i'm ever to have
a breakdown, let me have it now.

45
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:06,011
Double double decaf to go.

46
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:14,191
So, this is quite a surprise.
I forgot the nominations were out today.

47
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:18,524
Oh, isn't he precious?
You must be very proud of frasier.

48
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:21,174
Actually... no.

49
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:26,938
It's one more signpost on the road
of celebrity my brother's chosen.

50
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:30,965
Hope that's not sibling rivalry
rearing its green snout?!

51
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:35,875
Absolutely not. I believe
psychiatry's a noble profession,

52
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:41,370
...tarnished by popularity contests
and a bouncy radio programme!

53
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:46,951
I bet you two had wicked little
hair-pulling fights when you were tots!

54
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:52,736
It's been delightful, i must run.

55
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:56,983
My sexual addiction group -
i don't like to leave them alone too long.

56
00:03:58,446 --> 00:04:00,835
- Frasier!
- Roz!

57
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,906
We did it!

58
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,516
I know! Come sit down.
I've never won before.

59
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:10,584
Although back in prep school the
existentialist club

60
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:13,628
once named me most likely "to be"!

61
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:19,103
You wanna hear the great part?
I've a date for the ceremony -

62
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:21,178
brad macnamara!

63
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:24,340
The channel eight reporter?
Television's most handsome man.

64
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:30,635
He wouldn't give me time of day but
one nomination - he knew who i was!

65
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:33,515
Who are you?

66
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:36,048
Roz doyle, frasier's producer.

67
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:38,751
Oh, right.
I've seen you bring him coffee.

68
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:41,463
Would you mind getting mine?

69
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:46,783
Better get on the ball.
I've a lot to do!

70
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:52,873
Not really, i got your tux, rented a limo,
your tickets will be at the door.

71
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:56,683
The only thing you haven't taken
care of is finding me a date?!

72
00:04:57,005 --> 00:05:00,441
Your subtlety floors me!
I'd love to!

73
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:04,547
I'm thrilled, for you both -
but i've got to run.

74
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:07,356
Two clients weren't nominated.

75
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,552
I have to tell them
what a worthless award this is!

76
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,734
Daphne, you may not be aware of this,

77
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:20,745
but there's a secret
to opening champagne.

78
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:25,307
Especially a fine french champagne
as unprepossessing as this one -

79
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,376
$200 a bottle.

80
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:33,989
In order to prevent spillage
one does not simply twist out the cork.

81
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:40,531
Instead, hold the cork stationary.
Give the bottle three easy turns.

82
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:43,434
One...

83
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:46,635
Get some glasses!
Quick! Oh... oh, my god.

84
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:51,329
Eddie, get out of there,
you mangy little cur!

85
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:57,035
Here... oh, lord.

86
00:05:57,315 --> 00:06:00,910
That wasn't too bad.
I believe we've salvaged most of it.

87
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:03,625
A toast.
To my number-one son,

88
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:06,783
congratulations
on your first nomination for...

89
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:10,798
...well, anything!

90
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:14,276
- Frasier, i'm proud of you.
- Thanks, means a lot to me.

91
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:18,250
Mm... this champagne is delicious.

92
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:21,332
Exquisite. Dad, what do you think?

93
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:24,342
I was in the mood
for something domestic!

94
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:30,792
I must say, it's nice that
although i'm an employee,

95
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:34,258
you include me in family celebrations.

96
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:38,236
Never doubt that i think of you
as my equal in every way.

97
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:40,377
 

98
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:48,472
 

99
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:51,771
Oh, i'll get it.

100
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:54,426
- Would you?
- Like me to announce your visitor?

101
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:57,140
just open the door!

102
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:01,205
Oh, hello, roz!
Congratulations

103
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:06,142
thanks. I couldn't believe it myself.
Brad macnamara!

104
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:10,631
Roz, she was referring
to your seab nomination.

105
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,842
No, i meant brad macnamara.

106
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:19,003
- Think he wears pants under the desk?
- Not on my tv!

107
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:25,225
Girls, can we cut out
the pyjama party, please?

108
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:28,600
- Hello, mr c.
- Hey, roz, how's my girlfriend?

109
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:31,137
Well, she's nominated.

110
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:33,764
A glass of champagne?

111
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:36,073
It's french and unprepossessing.

112
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:40,290
Save your breath. It could come out
of a box - roz would have a glass of it!

113
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:44,726
I'm so proud of you, roz,

114
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:47,804
being recognised
in a male-dominated industry.

115
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:53,167
- One more step for working women.
- You're a credit to our gender.

116
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:55,433
Thank you.

117
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:59,518
That reminds me, do you have
a push-up bra i could borrow?

118
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:01,970
- I'll look.
- Thanks.

119
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:09,850
I'm sorry to barge in
but i had to show you this, frasier.

120
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:15,318
A friend at "broadcast" magazine
sent me a copy. It's a full-page ad.

121
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:21,411
'Wendy yashiro thanks the voting
committee for her nomination

122
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:24,910
'and hopes they consider her
for the award.'

123
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:29,578
This is shameless self-promotion,
very bad taste!

124
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:32,478
I know! What'll we put in our ad?

125
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:37,756
Wendy yashiro's up against you?
I like her - she's a cutie!

126
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,703
You're suggesting we put an ad in?

127
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:44,415
We're falling behind, mike sanchez
has sent out tapes of his show.

128
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:47,566
Mike sanchez? Oh, i like him!

129
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:50,943
Who knows
what fletcher grey's doing?

130
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:55,076
- Fletcher grey...!!
- thank you, dad! Geez!

131
00:08:56,494 --> 00:09:01,090
Well, all right. As long as
it's tasteful and understated.

132
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:05,167
Great. My friend'll
work something up for us.

133
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:09,940
Wait. If we want to stand out,
why run another boring ad?

134
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,256
We should do something different.

135
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:15,627
Last year's winner threw a party.

136
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:20,446
Ok, but we should do something else
to keep our names in their minds.

137
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:27,503
I know, personalized gifts from...
the new tiffany's catalogue!

138
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:30,817
- Ooh, that's good!
- I saw incredible cigarette cases.

139
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:34,741
No - sends out a bad message.
A silver flask?

140
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:37,669
We've already got your vote, roz.

141
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:41,119
I mightn't know about show business,

142
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:45,930
but gifts for people who could do
something for you, that's bribery!

143
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:48,125
It's a thank you for a nomination!

144
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:53,500
If i had to give a gift to get
an award it's not worth having.

145
00:09:53,885 --> 00:09:59,164
You might as well just go down
to the trophy store and buy one.

146
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:14,751
- I really want that award.
- Me, too.

147
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:16,703
Get that catalogue!

148
00:10:29,421 --> 00:10:31,377
Well, are you coming in or not?

149
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:35,347
This is a big moment.
I want to drink it in.

150
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:38,024
Me, too. Where's the bar?

151
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:42,222
Not so fast.
Me shoes are killing me!

152
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:46,749
I should never have let
that salesgirl talk me into them.

153
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:49,573
- They look good on you.
- You think so?

154
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:53,414
Dr crane. Bob peterson,
voting committee.

155
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:57,005
- I wanted to wish you luck.
- Thank you.

156
00:10:57,323 --> 00:11:00,520
- Oh, and thanks for the bathrobe.
- Oh... nothing!

157
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:03,341
People get out of the shower,
they're cold!

158
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:07,095
Hey, dr crane, love the watch!

159
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:11,653
Thanks, it was nothing.
Pretty good likeness of me, isn't it?!

160
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:17,295
Can we please sit down?
I have got to sit down.

161
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:20,635
Daphne, we're table eight.
This isn't our table!

162
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,761
It is now!

163
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:25,769
- Isn't that fletcher grey?
- I believe it is.

164
00:11:26,061 --> 00:11:28,734
You got your work cut out for you.

165
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:32,810
A class act!
I've listened to him for 20 years.

166
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:36,700
I don't usually do this,
but i'm going to shake his hand.

167
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,100
Hey, guys.

168
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:41,402
Oh, roz. My fellow nominee.

169
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:43,968
Everybody's talking about those gifts.

170
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:48,079
Did you see valet parking?
Half the key chains are ours!

171
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:51,571
This is a big night for me.

172
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:54,908
Please don't spoil it
by making fun of who i brought.

173
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:58,571
I thought you were bringing
brad macnamara.

174
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:02,639
He got called out on a story.
Some hospital went up in flames.

175
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:06,681
Do you know anyone
who has worse luck than i do?

176
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:10,965
Hi, dr crane.

177
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:15,819
- Oh, hi, noel
- noel shempsky's your date?

178
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:19,269
Uh, tip, dr crane?
If you're nominated again,

179
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:23,850
there's parking three blocks
away - they don't check after 6.00!

180
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:29,151
Oh, um... here are the car keys
so you can drive us home.

181
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:31,413
I have night blindness.

182
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:35,714
I wish i did.

183
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:40,999
- Hi. I'm noel.
- Nice to meet you.

184
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:44,738
Can you rub me feet?
- Oh, daphne!

185
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:49,527
- Good evening, everybody.
- Niles! Thanks for coming!

186
00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:53,050
I know how you feel about this award
and coming downtown after dark.

187
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:55,790
Don't be silly, you're my brother.

188
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:58,103
- Hello, daphne.
- Can you rub me feet?

189
00:12:58,361 --> 00:13:00,317
- Yes.
- Niles!

190
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:07,799
- Where's maris?
- We were leaving

191
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:11,079
when maris
glimpsed herself in the mirror...

192
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:13,683
at the end of this, will i roll my eyes?

193
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,554
- I did.
- Well, then, skip it!

194
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:20,398
Listen, get me a scotch, would you?

195
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:25,669
That fletcher grey, he's aces!
He remembered me from 1968!

196
00:13:26,056 --> 00:13:29,173
I worked on a murder case
he covered.

197
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:32,832
He looked at me and said, "hey,
you're the guy who found the head!"

198
00:13:36,066 --> 00:13:39,741
He's been nominated 11 times
and never won.

199
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:42,789
Really? Geez, i didn't know that.

200
00:13:43,073 --> 00:13:45,541
I'm afraid he'll have to lose again.

201
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:50,945
If he does, you can cheer him up -
send something from your gift shop!

202
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:55,293
- Dr crane?
- Fletcher grey!

203
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:59,055
Been meaning to wish you luck
even though you don't need it.

204
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:02,691
That's kind, but i hardly think
i have a chance against you!

205
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:06,160
I hope you're right. I'd love to win.

206
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:09,978
11 losses - it's a little embarrassing!

207
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:14,544
Oh, you'd have to lose 15, 16 times
before you could feel ashamed.

208
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:19,370
Would you believe,
i considered campaigning this year?

209
00:14:20,402 --> 00:14:23,075
Sending out gifts, throwing a party.

210
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:27,515
I bet you'd have something to say
about someone that self-absorbed!

211
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:31,143
He could do a whole hour on it!

212
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:34,571
Dear, they're starting
to serve the salads.

213
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:39,550
Oh, mom! I'm 60 years old
and i'm still her little boy.

214
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:43,800
- Dr crane. My mother, hannah.
- Nice to meet you.

215
00:14:44,968 --> 00:14:50,088
Mom just flew in from scottsdale.
This is her 11th year.

216
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:56,533
I hope he wins it this time.

217
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:59,805
It's getting harder and harder
to get on that plane.

218
00:15:02,027 --> 00:15:06,976
Why don't you go back to the table
before your legs swell up?

219
00:15:07,365 --> 00:15:12,120
I'll get you another pink lady.
No, no, no, mom, over there.

220
00:15:14,706 --> 00:15:17,425
Sorry - been detained!

221
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:19,665
Civilization won't advance one iota

222
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:23,070
till they put more toilets
in the ladies' room!

223
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:28,914
- Thank you, niles.
- Oh, champagne!

224
00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:33,483
Uh, a diet root beer?

225
00:15:36,478 --> 00:15:39,595
I have to tell you the buzz in line

226
00:15:39,898 --> 00:15:43,254
was that those gifts
you've been sending paid off.

227
00:15:43,568 --> 00:15:46,560
It looks like you're in a neck-and-neck
race with fletcher grey,

228
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:49,696
that wrinkled warhorse...

229
00:15:52,494 --> 00:15:54,883
hello, mr crane.

230
00:15:55,163 --> 00:15:57,916
You're more handsome than before!

231
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:01,837
If i were 20 years older,
they couldn't keep me away!

232
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:04,126
That's why i keep this cane!

233
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:11,164
Good evening,
would everybody take their seats?

234
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:16,261
I'm keith bishop, welcome
to the 15th annual seab awards.

235
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:20,761
Assisting me tonight in handing out
the awards is miss seab 1994,

236
00:16:21,106 --> 00:16:23,256
tawny van deusen.

237
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:34,661
I'm starting to feel uncomfortable
about the campaigning.

238
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:40,115
Fletcher's been nominated 11 times!
He didn't lift a finger to win this.

239
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,651
Don't worry about him,
he can win it next year.

240
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:50,037
Before we start this evening,
i'd like to make a sad announcement.

241
00:16:50,427 --> 00:16:54,181
I just found out
that the dean of seattle radio,

242
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:58,348
my mentor, fletcher grey,
will be retiring this year.

243
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:00,676
ahhhh!

244
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:04,172
Take a bow, fletcher.

245
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:11,648
We're gonna start with a bang!

246
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:15,740
The award for achievement
in informational programming.

247
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:18,193
That's us!

248
00:17:18,455 --> 00:17:22,050
Can't see a thing without my glasses!

249
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:29,098
Fletcher deserves this award.
If we win - can't we just not accept it?

250
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:32,305
I've waited ten years to get this.

251
00:17:32,594 --> 00:17:37,270
If i have to crawl over fletcher's
mother to get it, i'll do it!

252
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:42,262
Roz, i've never seen you like this!

253
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,875
- It isn't pretty
- the nominations...

254
00:17:45,148 --> 00:17:49,460
"community forum" - wendy yashiro:

255
00:17:52,781 --> 00:17:58,617

257

00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:13,430
"Fletcher grey: From where i sit" -

259
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:16,357
fletcher grey: Talent and producer.

260
00:18:20,141 --> 00:18:22,416
bravo! Bravo!

261
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:27,141
If we win this thing,
they're gonna lynch us!

262
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,477
At least everyone will see my dress!

263
00:18:32,487 --> 00:18:36,036
Well, this is a first.
It seems we have a tie.

264
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:40,598
- Good, we can share it with fletcher!
- I'm already sharing it with you!

265
00:18:42,205 --> 00:18:45,914
And the winners are
wendy yashiro and mike sanchez!

266
00:18:46,251 --> 00:18:49,846
- What?
- What?

267
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:52,287
 

268
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:04,068
The party's over.
Are you coming home?

269
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:07,150
- No, dad.
- We'll just go without you.

270
00:19:07,439 --> 00:19:09,077
Fine.

271
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,995
I don't agree with the way you went
about it but i'm sorry you lost.

272
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,834
It's never easy to lose.

273
00:19:17,115 --> 00:19:19,549
Thanks, dad.

274
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:24,024
Of course, if you'd joined sport
at an early age...

275
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:27,648
- dad
- all right, sorry, wrong time!

276
00:19:27,959 --> 00:19:31,429
We'll talk about it over breakfast.

277
00:19:31,755 --> 00:19:36,112
Ok, daphne, let's get you home
and soak your feet in epsom salts.

278
00:19:36,468 --> 00:19:39,380
Oh, i have the life of a princess!

279
00:19:40,764 --> 00:19:44,040
Don't feel bad, roz.
It's an honour just to get a nomination.

280
00:19:44,351 --> 00:19:46,546
Will you stop saying that?

281
00:19:46,811 --> 00:19:49,200
Ok, i'm leaving.

282
00:19:49,481 --> 00:19:52,837
Oh, no, no, i'm sorry,
i'm just despondent.

283
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:56,810
No, no, go ahead.

284
00:19:57,072 --> 00:19:59,267
Roz!

285
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:04,481
Noel, noel, i'm sorry. Thank you.
I'll see you at work on monday?

286
00:20:09,376 --> 00:20:12,209
- How are you?
- Oh, i've been better.

287
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:15,586
Thank you.

288
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:24,694
When you feel the sting of losing

289
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:29,206
you have to realise the fact
that it's not about awards,

290
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:33,999
it's not about accolades,
it's about a body of work.

291
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:37,908
If you can look in the mirror
and say you've done a good job,

292
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:40,706
that's what matters.

293
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:45,381
If you can do that,
let the awards fall where they may.

294
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:51,725
Wow! All those nominations,
nothing to show for it.

295
00:20:53,253 --> 00:20:56,962
He still walks out, head high,
and a smile on his face.

296
00:21:00,802 --> 00:21:03,919
I'm never gonna get nominated again.

297
00:21:04,222 --> 00:21:06,656
- Oh, come on, roz.
- I'm not.

298
00:21:07,851 --> 00:21:11,890
The world's full of winners
and losers - i'm a loser.

299
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:17,350
- I wouldn't be with you if you were.
- Come on, we're a team.

300
00:21:18,153 --> 00:21:22,624
Before we're done we're going
to win lots of these things.

301
00:21:22,991 --> 00:21:25,710
You and i are amigos, compadres.

302
00:21:25,994 --> 00:21:28,030
Ok? Now,
i'm not going to leave your side

303
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:30,199
till i see a little smile on that face.

304
