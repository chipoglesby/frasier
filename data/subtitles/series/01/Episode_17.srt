1
00:00:07,887 --> 00:00:09,878
Cappuccino, half-caf, non-fat milk,

2
00:00:10,142 --> 00:00:12,417
enough foam
to be aesthetically pleasing.

3
00:00:12,687 --> 00:00:16,316
- But it mustn't leave a moustache.
- Cinnamon or chocolate?

4
00:00:16,652 --> 00:00:19,212
This is so complicated. Um, cinnamon.

5
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:22,050
- And you?
- I'll have the...

6
00:00:22,328 --> 00:00:24,444
- look, it's daphne!
- Daphne!

7
00:00:24,707 --> 00:00:28,177
Oh, hello! Thought you might be here.
Please, sit.

8
00:00:28,505 --> 00:00:31,622
- I just stopped in for a bag of beans.
- Oh, well...

9
00:00:31,927 --> 00:00:33,679
- can i help?
- Two pounds of...

10
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:35,727
Kenya blend.

11
00:00:35,975 --> 00:00:39,365
- You remembered.
- What about my order?

12
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:41,920
Most people find it too intense.

13
00:00:42,194 --> 00:00:45,743
I like something that holds its body
on me tongue.

14
00:00:47,453 --> 00:00:49,523
We've spilt something. If you could...

15
00:00:51,501 --> 00:00:55,858
would you like something robust,
if it didn't come on too strong?

16
00:00:56,218 --> 00:00:58,937
If it was a little bit sweet
i might like it.

17
00:00:59,222 --> 00:01:03,374
- Want to come try my special blend?
- I'd love to.

18
00:01:06,067 --> 00:01:08,422
Oh, nothing for me, thanks!

19
00:01:09,739 --> 00:01:13,049
That man is hitting on our daphne.
How does she stand it?

20
00:01:14,497 --> 00:01:17,967
Apropos of nothing,
how are things with you and maris?

21
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:23,169
Are you implying my concern
for daphne is less than pure?

22
00:01:23,512 --> 00:01:25,821
- You tell me.
- That's your shortcoming.

23
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,409
You're always suspicious.

24
00:01:28,688 --> 00:01:32,044
You should have faith in people.
What's he doing?

25
00:01:33,279 --> 00:01:35,713
- Bagging her beans.
- Oh!

26
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:41,323
I'm so excited.
Eric's taking me to hear his band.

27
00:01:41,667 --> 00:01:44,898
It's not me night off,
but i'll switch if that's ok.

28
00:01:46,091 --> 00:01:48,651
Isn't he lovely?
I have a nickname for him.

29
00:01:48,929 --> 00:01:52,160
Eric the red. It favours him, doesn't it?
He looks like a viking.

30
00:01:52,477 --> 00:01:54,513
- Well...
- well, ta-ta.

31
00:01:54,773 --> 00:01:57,241
Oh, look at me. I forgot me beans.

32
00:01:57,526 --> 00:02:00,120
Earth to daphne.

33
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:06,410
How could she like him? He has
community college written all over him.

34
00:02:06,792 --> 00:02:10,421
Niles, this infatuation with daphne
is getting out of hand.

35
00:02:10,757 --> 00:02:15,035
I didn't mind when it was flirtation,
but i can't help thinking that there's...

36
00:02:15,389 --> 00:02:20,861
this is symptomatic of something
wrong between you and maris.

37
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:24,505
- Is it?
- I can't lie.

38
00:02:24,822 --> 00:02:28,178
The truth is,
maris and i are in a bit of a rut.

39
00:02:28,494 --> 00:02:31,645
We seem to have lapsed
into grey, numbing blandness.

40
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:35,554
That's perfectly normal
in a relationship of some years.

41
00:02:35,881 --> 00:02:37,872
Try spicing things up a bit.

42
00:02:38,136 --> 00:02:40,411
You mean, boudoir-wise?

43
00:02:40,681 --> 00:02:43,673
- For starters, yeah.
- How?

44
00:02:43,979 --> 00:02:45,810
Well...

45
00:02:46,065 --> 00:02:48,420
the two of you could, uh...

46
00:02:50,448 --> 00:02:52,484
well, you could...

47
00:02:52,742 --> 00:02:55,017
it's you and maris, so you could...

48
00:02:57,459 --> 00:03:00,053
i'm stumped.

49
00:03:03,886 --> 00:03:06,002
How are you?

50
00:03:06,265 --> 00:03:08,221
You wanna know?
Or are you making conversation?

51
00:03:08,477 --> 00:03:11,310
If you wanna know, i'll tell you.

52
00:03:11,607 --> 00:03:13,757
I was making conversation.

53
00:03:14,028 --> 00:03:17,100
- Actually, i need advice.
- About what?

54
00:03:17,408 --> 00:03:19,558
A subject in which
you're well versed: Sex.

55
00:03:19,829 --> 00:03:22,059
How can i help you?

56
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:26,326
What do you do when the romance
goes out of a relationship?

57
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:28,982
I get dressed and go home.

58
00:03:31,139 --> 00:03:34,415
Let's assume that you are capable
of a long-term relationship.

59
00:03:34,728 --> 00:03:39,483
- How would you keep things cooking?
- Once a boyfriend took me to a bar.

60
00:03:39,862 --> 00:03:45,095
We pretended we were strangers
picking each other up. That was hot.

61
00:03:46,498 --> 00:03:48,932
You used fantasy, role-playing?

62
00:03:49,211 --> 00:03:52,044
We had so much fun we tried it again.

63
00:03:52,341 --> 00:03:55,413
Next time, he got so into it
he went home with another woman.

64
00:03:56,974 --> 00:03:59,010
- I'm sorry.
- She was gorgeous.

65
00:03:59,269 --> 00:04:02,227
One more drink
i'd have gone home with her.

66
00:04:02,525 --> 00:04:05,722
Women need to see
the men they make love to

67
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:08,783
as exciting, romantic figures.

68
00:04:09,077 --> 00:04:13,832
If you want to keep her interested,
create a fantasy for an evening.

69
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:18,123
Personally, i think you'd make
a very sexy gladiator.

70
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:24,019
- This is not for me. It's for niles.
- In that case, make it a gladiola.

71
00:04:26,856 --> 00:04:28,209
 

72
00:04:29,694 --> 00:04:31,650
 

73
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,997
Niles! Niles!

74
00:04:37,248 --> 00:04:42,242
I'm sorry, but something horrible
has happened. Maris kicked me out.

75
00:04:42,633 --> 00:04:45,101
Dear god, why? What for?

76
00:04:56,112 --> 00:04:59,741
- Oh, my!
- What's going on out there? Niles?

77
00:05:00,078 --> 00:05:01,830
Hello, dad.

78
00:05:04,794 --> 00:05:07,262
- I don't want to know.
- Wait.

79
00:05:07,549 --> 00:05:10,017
There's a reasonable explanation.

80
00:05:10,303 --> 00:05:13,454
All right, but i reserve the right
to say "stop" at any time.

81
00:05:13,767 --> 00:05:16,918
My plan was to leave
a treasure map downstairs for maris

82
00:05:17,231 --> 00:05:19,620
with clues to lead her
to my whereabouts.

83
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:24,498
Then i'd hide in the linen closet
and wait for her to find me.

84
00:05:24,868 --> 00:05:26,824
Dressed like that?

85
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:31,073
Actually, no. At the time,
i was wearing only my eye patch.

86
00:05:32,464 --> 00:05:35,262
But is it still an eye patch
if you wear it on your...

87
00:05:35,553 --> 00:05:37,305
stop!

88
00:05:41,771 --> 00:05:46,367
There i was - ooh - with my little
plastic knife between my teeth.

89
00:05:46,738 --> 00:05:48,968
Suddenly the closet door opened,

90
00:05:49,242 --> 00:05:52,154
and i found myself
face to face with the maid.

91
00:05:53,833 --> 00:06:00,147
She screamed - what i gather were
unflattering things - in guatemalan.

92
00:06:00,594 --> 00:06:05,987
Maris stumbled upon the scene
and ordered me out of the house.

93
00:06:06,395 --> 00:06:11,549
I barely had time to grab my pantaloons
and buckle my swash.

94
00:06:11,947 --> 00:06:13,744
 

95
00:06:13,991 --> 00:06:17,620
Dad! Dad, it's not funny.

96
00:06:17,957 --> 00:06:19,993
Where did you get that stupid idea?

97
00:06:20,252 --> 00:06:22,129
Frasier?

98
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:27,329
All i suggested was role-playing. You
came up with pirates of the caribbean.

99
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:33,825
- I've really bungled it, haven't i?
- These things happen.

100
00:06:34,149 --> 00:06:38,188
Why don't you stay here now,
and tomorrow you'll sort things out?

101
00:06:38,532 --> 00:06:40,363
What if we don't?

102
00:06:40,618 --> 00:06:44,247
They could use an extra busboy
at the jolly roger.

103
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:47,893
I'll never be able to face the maid again.

104
00:06:48,214 --> 00:06:50,774
I don't think it's your face
she'll remember.

105
00:06:52,555 --> 00:06:56,025
Come on, niles.
Everybody has an embarrassing story.

106
00:06:56,352 --> 00:06:59,310
Did i tell you about getting
locked out, in my underwear?

107
00:06:59,609 --> 00:07:02,123
- Every thanksgiving.
- Don't worry,

108
00:07:02,404 --> 00:07:04,634
i won't be telling that story this year.

109
00:07:07,204 --> 00:07:11,163
Canadian goose down pillow,
egyptian cotton sheet,

110
00:07:11,502 --> 00:07:15,290
- and a vicuna throw for if you're chilly.
- Perfect.

111
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:18,866
The service would've done you boys
the world of good.

112
00:07:20,059 --> 00:07:22,812
- Good night!
- Good night.

113
00:07:23,105 --> 00:07:28,702
Maris and i have had difficulties before,
but nothing this serious.

114
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:33,711
I feel terrible having her mad at me.
I wish i knew how to cry.

115
00:07:34,082 --> 00:07:37,438
- Don't be embarrassed on my account.
- No, it's not that.

116
00:07:37,754 --> 00:07:40,712
I just don't cry. It's not in my nature.

117
00:07:41,009 --> 00:07:43,967
When maris' uncle died,
i shut my hand in a door,

118
00:07:44,265 --> 00:07:47,257
just to make a decent show
at the funeral.

119
00:07:48,438 --> 00:07:51,111
You're a complex little pirate,
aren't you?

120
00:07:53,196 --> 00:07:56,233
- Well, good night, niles.
- Good night.

121
00:08:10,016 --> 00:08:12,576
Thank you, eric.
I had a wonderful time.

122
00:08:12,854 --> 00:08:15,163
Me, too.

123
00:08:18,322 --> 00:08:21,200
- Well, good night.
- Good night.

124
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,906
 

125
00:08:37,978 --> 00:08:39,934
We've only had a few dates

126
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:43,388
but i'm exhibiting
the three signs of love.

127
00:08:43,738 --> 00:08:45,694
I can't stop thinking about him.

128
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:48,623
I can't eat
and i bought myself all new underwear.

129
00:08:51,417 --> 00:08:54,011
We got to get her a girlfriend to talk to.

130
00:08:57,928 --> 00:09:01,716
I called maris.
She's in arizona for the weekend.

131
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:06,611
- Why?
- She's flown to her favourite spa

132
00:09:06,984 --> 00:09:10,659
to contemplate our marriage -
from a mud bath.

133
00:09:10,991 --> 00:09:15,189
It'll be good for her.
Eric thinks the earth is grounding.

134
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:19,329
Eric, eric! Must everything
always be about eric?!

135
00:09:25,014 --> 00:09:28,893
I suggest when maris returns
you have intensive couples therapy...

136
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:32,461
oh, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

137
00:09:34,363 --> 00:09:36,752
She just needs to know you love her.

138
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:40,310
Buy her flowers. Fix a romantic dinner.

139
00:09:40,623 --> 00:09:43,581
- That'll make any woman forgive you.
- That will work?

140
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:47,394
If it didn't, you wouldn't be here.

141
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:55,282
I'm willing to try, but our cook
walked out in sympathy with maris.

142
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:59,000
I could help you.
I have a late date with eric...

143
00:09:59,321 --> 00:10:01,994
...ca, an elderly aunt erica,

144
00:10:02,284 --> 00:10:06,994
...but i could have everything ready
by the time mrs crane arrives.

145
00:10:07,376 --> 00:10:10,049
Well, thank you, daphne.

146
00:10:10,339 --> 00:10:12,569
What does mrs crane like to eat?

147
00:10:12,843 --> 00:10:14,879
You have free rein.

148
00:10:15,139 --> 00:10:19,769
Bear in mind she can't have
shellfish, poultry, red meat, nitrates,

149
00:10:20,147 --> 00:10:23,776
wheat, starch, sulphites, msg or dairy.

150
00:10:26,032 --> 00:10:29,468
- Did i say nuts?
- Oh, i think that's implied.

151
00:10:34,754 --> 00:10:36,710
 

152
00:10:44,186 --> 00:10:46,336
 

153
00:10:51,449 --> 00:10:54,247
Come in and warm yourself by the fire.

154
00:10:54,537 --> 00:10:58,530
- How did you get so wet?
- One of your trees blew down.

155
00:10:58,878 --> 00:11:01,392
- I had to walk the last 100 yards.
- Oh.

156
00:11:01,674 --> 00:11:04,586
I must say, you have a beautiful home.

157
00:11:04,888 --> 00:11:08,676
Thank you. It was in maris' family
for four generations.

158
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:14,299
When i was an intern i drove through
these hills, never dreaming i'd live here.

159
00:11:14,695 --> 00:11:18,734
Then one afternoon, there was maris,
looking so helpless,

160
00:11:19,077 --> 00:11:21,875
banging on the electric gates
with her little fists.

161
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:25,681
- They'd locked her in?
- No, no, that was much later.

162
00:11:27,634 --> 00:11:30,228
This time she had been
at an antique mart.

163
00:11:30,514 --> 00:11:35,304
Bought a rare bell jar once owned by
sylvia plath. The gates failed to open.

164
00:11:35,688 --> 00:11:38,441
Naturally, i offered my assistance.

165
00:11:38,735 --> 00:11:42,364
Our hands touched,
there was a sudden spark of electricity,

166
00:11:42,699 --> 00:11:45,497
and, as if by magic, the gates parted.

167
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:48,780
- We took it as a sign.
- You were meant to be together.

168
00:11:49,086 --> 00:11:52,874
Yes. We were married
just three short years later.

169
00:11:53,217 --> 00:11:56,254
Look at this. It's beautiful.

170
00:11:56,556 --> 00:11:59,832
It's a glockenspiel. We bought it
on our honeymoon in zurich.

171
00:12:00,146 --> 00:12:03,183
I brought it down from the attic
to remind maris of better times.

172
00:12:03,484 --> 00:12:08,717
It used to play beautiful music -
now it doesn't. How's that for irony?

173
00:12:09,119 --> 00:12:11,679
Let's get you dry clothes, so you can

174
00:12:11,956 --> 00:12:14,914
make dinner
and get home for your date.

175
00:12:15,212 --> 00:12:17,601
 

176
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:21,193
Daphne?

177
00:12:22,724 --> 00:12:25,522
- What is it?
- Nothing.

178
00:12:25,812 --> 00:12:29,646
No, no. I'm a psychiatrist -
i can read the signs.

179
00:12:29,986 --> 00:12:34,184
I'm sorry. I didn't want to spoil
your reunion with mrs crane,

180
00:12:34,535 --> 00:12:37,652
but... eric broke up with me.

181
00:12:38,876 --> 00:12:40,867
- He did?
- Yes.

182
00:12:41,129 --> 00:12:44,166
He said he couldn't
commit to me and his music.

183
00:12:44,469 --> 00:12:47,905
He had to stay focussed.
I know it was an excuse.

184
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:50,455
I've heard his music.

185
00:12:52,022 --> 00:12:56,300
- He must have another girl.
- Oh... oh, oh, oh!

186
00:12:57,615 --> 00:13:02,484
He's a fool. If he can't appreciate you,
you're better off without him.

187
00:13:02,874 --> 00:13:07,789
Right now, i'm not so sure,
but thank you, dr crane.

188
00:13:08,174 --> 00:13:09,846
 

189
00:13:13,558 --> 00:13:16,595
Niles crane. Oh, maris!

190
00:13:17,898 --> 00:13:19,650
Where... where are you?

191
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,235
What d'you mean
you can't come home?

192
00:13:23,491 --> 00:13:25,482
It's not that bad a storm.

193
00:13:25,744 --> 00:13:27,780
 

194
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:32,704
Oh, maris,
i really think you should come home.

195
00:13:36,387 --> 00:13:40,221
No, of course. I don't want you
travelling if it's not safe.

196
00:13:41,605 --> 00:13:44,073
Yes, i understand. See you tomorrow.

197
00:13:47,698 --> 00:13:50,974
Well... seems like it's just the two of us.

198
00:13:51,287 --> 00:13:53,562
You mean,
mrs crane won't be coming?

199
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,789
 

200
00:13:58,674 --> 00:14:01,108
Oh my, there goes the electricity!

201
00:14:02,222 --> 00:14:04,577
What do we do now?

202
00:14:10,945 --> 00:14:14,733
The storm's really bad.
You shouldn't drive.

203
00:14:15,076 --> 00:14:18,830
You just spend the night there.
Good night, daphne.

204
00:14:20,043 --> 00:14:23,513
- You told her to spend the night?
- What's the problem?

205
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:28,630
- You know how niles feels about her.
- Relax, it's just a little crush.

206
00:14:29,015 --> 00:14:33,054
Yes, niles is harmless. He'd never try
anything with maris around.

207
00:14:33,398 --> 00:14:35,275
Maris is in arizona.

208
00:14:35,527 --> 00:14:38,485
- I got to get daphne out of there!
- Why?

209
00:14:38,782 --> 00:14:43,697
It's a recipe for disaster. All alone
in a gothic mansion on a rainy night.

210
00:14:44,082 --> 00:14:47,040
It only lacks someone shouting
"heathcliff!" across the moors.

211
00:14:47,337 --> 00:14:49,612
- Wait!
- You're not coming.

212
00:14:49,883 --> 00:14:52,192
- Yes, i am.
- No, you're not.

213
00:14:53,389 --> 00:14:55,903
 

214
00:15:02,029 --> 00:15:06,898
- Oh, dr crane, you play beautifully.
- Thank you.

215
00:15:07,287 --> 00:15:10,040
 

216
00:15:13,047 --> 00:15:15,003
 

217
00:15:17,012 --> 00:15:20,049
I found this in the guest room.
I hope it's all right.

218
00:15:20,351 --> 00:15:22,660
I thought you'd put on maris' clothes.

219
00:15:22,939 --> 00:15:26,056
Something bulky
from her wool collection.

220
00:15:26,361 --> 00:15:31,833
She's quite a bit smaller than me.
This was all i could find that fit.

221
00:15:32,245 --> 00:15:34,713
- Should i go look for something else?
- No... yes.

222
00:15:34,999 --> 00:15:36,751
No, oh, no...

223
00:15:37,003 --> 00:15:39,312
Ooh!

224
00:15:40,676 --> 00:15:43,270
No. As long as it's big enough.

225
00:15:43,555 --> 00:15:46,274
And... warm enough. And...

226
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,678
...silky enough. And...

227
00:15:51,026 --> 00:15:53,062
i have to make a phone call.

228
00:15:57,996 --> 00:16:00,590
 

229
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:04,387
'Hello, this is dr frasier crane.

230
00:16:04,674 --> 00:16:05,629
'I'm listening.'

231
00:16:05,842 --> 00:16:07,070
 

232
00:16:07,303 --> 00:16:09,373
'Frasier, frasier?

233
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:13,553
'I'm having a little crisis here.
Actually a large crisis.

234
00:16:13,897 --> 00:16:17,367
'It's no time to screen calls. Damn! '

235
00:16:20,491 --> 00:16:22,288
- This is stupid.
- No.

236
00:16:22,536 --> 00:16:25,528
- Nothing will happen between them.
- What if it does?

237
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:27,869
He's my brother, and he loves his wife.

238
00:16:28,129 --> 00:16:30,927
Their marriage
isn't everyone's cup of tea,

239
00:16:31,217 --> 00:16:34,812
but on some twisted, bizarre level
it works for them.

240
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:39,053
If niles hurts his marriage, he'd suffer.
I won't let him suffer.

241
00:16:39,397 --> 00:16:41,308
You'll miss the roosevelt.

242
00:16:41,568 --> 00:16:45,243
I let you come
if you agreed not to give directions.

243
00:16:45,574 --> 00:16:47,326
It's just faster.

244
00:16:47,577 --> 00:16:51,536
- Roosevelt will add ten minutes.
- In rain, it's faster.

245
00:16:51,876 --> 00:16:55,664
- Spatial relationships change in rain?
- There's better traction.

246
00:16:56,008 --> 00:16:58,363
If you had all-weather tyres
like i told you...

247
00:16:58,638 --> 00:17:01,948
- come on!
- You had to buy some german thing...

248
00:17:05,732 --> 00:17:08,929
we'd better make this last.
It's all that's left of the wood.

249
00:17:09,239 --> 00:17:10,991
 

250
00:17:11,242 --> 00:17:12,994
Don't worry.

251
00:17:13,245 --> 00:17:18,444
If this runs out, there's an antique
sideboard that i think is reproduction.

252
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:21,113
Oh, it's eric, isn't it?

253
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:24,285
Don't know why i'm being so silly.

254
00:17:24,556 --> 00:17:27,628
We weren't together long enough
for anything to happen.

255
00:17:29,062 --> 00:17:32,611
Powerful feelings can come
from the promise of what might happen.

256
00:17:32,944 --> 00:17:36,903
Anticipation makes all the little hairs
on your neck stand on end.

257
00:17:38,829 --> 00:17:41,263
 

258
00:17:41,542 --> 00:17:43,612
- Dr crane!
- Yes?

259
00:17:43,879 --> 00:17:46,074
- We're losing the fire.
- No, we're not.

260
00:17:46,341 --> 00:17:49,378
It's burning
with the heat of a thousand suns!

261
00:17:50,681 --> 00:17:52,876
It's down to its last embers!

262
00:17:53,144 --> 00:17:56,102
Well, then, i'll put some wood on it.

263
00:17:56,399 --> 00:17:59,152
You flooded it.

264
00:17:59,446 --> 00:18:02,006
You cannot flood a fuel-injected engine.

265
00:18:02,284 --> 00:18:06,960
This is maddening. We're so close
to the house, i can see the gargoyles.

266
00:18:07,334 --> 00:18:10,053
- If we'd taken roosevelt...
- we'd be stuck there.

267
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:12,899
- You made a mistake.
- That is it!

268
00:18:13,177 --> 00:18:15,850
Call the auto club, i'll make a dash for it.

269
00:18:17,017 --> 00:18:20,976
You should take the shortcut
by the side of the fountain.

270
00:18:21,315 --> 00:18:23,351
Same to you!

271
00:18:25,823 --> 00:18:29,020
I suppose i just fall in love too fast.

272
00:18:29,329 --> 00:18:33,242
The minute i feel that spark
i give my heart away.

273
00:18:33,585 --> 00:18:36,895
Daphne,
stop being so hard on yourself.

274
00:18:37,217 --> 00:18:40,095
What you see as a fault
is also your greatest gift -

275
00:18:40,389 --> 00:18:44,064
to be so open and warm and loving.

276
00:18:44,395 --> 00:18:47,353
You're so kind, dr crane.

277
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:50,164
I'm glad we ended up like this tonight.

278
00:18:50,447 --> 00:18:52,244
So am i.

279
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:58,564
It's just so nice to be with a man
you feel so comfortable with.

280
00:18:58,961 --> 00:19:01,680
I feel very close to you.

281
00:19:01,966 --> 00:19:04,764
I feel very close to you too, daphne.

282
00:19:05,054 --> 00:19:07,614
It's easy being someone
you feel close to,

283
00:19:07,893 --> 00:19:12,728
when you feel close to someone
who's so... close.

284
00:19:13,401 --> 00:19:15,278
 

285
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:17,486
 

286
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:24,930
Dr crane,
your glockenspiel has sprung to life.

287
00:19:32,517 --> 00:19:34,508
Oh, the clock!

288
00:19:37,358 --> 00:19:40,156
My god, it hasn't run like this in years!

289
00:19:40,446 --> 00:19:42,721
Maris will be delighted!

290
00:19:46,456 --> 00:19:48,208
Maris!

291
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:53,321
You really love her, don't you?

292
00:19:53,634 --> 00:19:55,750
You know, i do.

293
00:19:58,308 --> 00:20:02,426
Love's a funny thing, isn't it?
Sometimes it's exciting, passionate.

294
00:20:02,774 --> 00:20:05,846
Sometimes it's something else.

295
00:20:06,155 --> 00:20:08,988
Something comfortable and familiar.

296
00:20:09,286 --> 00:20:11,242
That newly exfoliated little face

297
00:20:11,497 --> 00:20:14,409
staring at you
across the breakfast table.

298
00:20:15,963 --> 00:20:20,479
Sharing a laugh when seeing someone
wearing white after labour day.

299
00:20:22,223 --> 00:20:25,340
I hope some day,
some man will feel that way about me.

300
00:20:25,645 --> 00:20:27,875
Oh! Daphne, don't worry.

301
00:20:28,859 --> 00:20:31,657
You are a very special person.

302
00:20:31,947 --> 00:20:35,383
Some day a man worthy of you
will come along.

303
00:20:35,704 --> 00:20:38,423
Just as soon as the gods create him.

304
00:20:38,709 --> 00:20:42,338
That's the loveliest thing
anyone's ever said to me.

305
00:20:42,673 --> 00:20:45,631
Thank you. You're a good friend.

306
00:20:47,974 --> 00:20:50,010
Stop!!!

307
00:20:53,817 --> 00:20:55,933
Frasier!

308
00:20:58,324 --> 00:21:02,602
- Have you gone mad? You'll regret it.
- What are you talking about?

309
00:21:02,957 --> 00:21:06,745
The two of you alone.
The fire, the candlelight, the nightie!

310
00:21:07,089 --> 00:21:10,206
Dr crane,
you didn't think dr crane and i...

311
00:21:11,346 --> 00:21:14,702
dr crane! You have some nerve

312
00:21:15,018 --> 00:21:18,055
to imply your brother
would do anything so deplorable!!

313
00:21:18,357 --> 00:21:23,590
He just made a beautiful speech
about how much he loves his wife.

314
00:21:23,992 --> 00:21:27,189
How he cherishes
her excruciating little face.

315
00:21:27,497 --> 00:21:30,534
And how they laugh at white people.

316
00:21:32,046 --> 00:21:34,480
- That didn't sound right.
- Close enough.

317
00:21:36,053 --> 00:21:39,329
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to suggest...
i wasn't implying...

318
00:21:39,642 --> 00:21:42,440
then what was it
you wanted us to stop doing?

319
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,789
I wanted you to stop... uh...

320
00:21:47,071 --> 00:21:50,905
standing in silence!
A night like this calls for music!

321
00:21:51,245 --> 00:21:54,920
Daphne, wine for all of us.
Niles, join me at the piano, please.

322
00:21:57,297 --> 00:22:00,414
- You sure everything's all right?
- Absolutely.

323
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:04,314
Frasier,
my glockenspiel is working again.

324
00:22:08,857 --> 00:22:11,291
 

325
00:22:13,114 --> 00:22:15,992
 

326
00:22:16,286 --> 00:22:18,720
# Tossed salads and scrambled eggs

327
00:22:19,792 --> 00:22:21,066
# mercy!

328
00:22:21,294 --> 00:22:25,890
# Maybe i seem a bit confused
well, maybe, but i got you pegged

329
00:22:27,973 --> 00:22:33,127
# but i don't know what to do with those
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

330
00:22:34,233 --> 00:22:36,383
# they're calling again #

331
00:22:36,653 --> 00:22:39,565
frasier has left the building.
