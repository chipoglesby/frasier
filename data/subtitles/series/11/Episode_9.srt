1
00:00:09,075 --> 00:00:12,012
Hey, you're up early.

2
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,013
Rain wake you?

3
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:14,314
Oh, I'm just
a little preoccupied.

4
00:00:14,314 --> 00:00:16,009
Well, if there's
something on your mind,

5
00:00:16,316 --> 00:00:17,317
you can tell me.

6
00:00:17,317 --> 00:00:20,309
It won't be long
before I'm your mom.

7
00:00:20,587 --> 00:00:23,351
I was actually going to tell you
before you said that.

8
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:25,592
Aw... come on.

9
00:00:25,592 --> 00:00:29,195
Well, there's this woman
I can't seem to get off of my mind.

10
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:30,219
A woman with a boyfriend.

11
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:31,698
Hmm...

12
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:33,266
Well, why don't you just
get her drunk

13
00:00:33,266 --> 00:00:35,234
and see what happens.

14
00:00:36,603 --> 00:00:39,071
You are nothing like my mother.

15
00:00:41,408 --> 00:00:43,410
Hey, Ronee,
better get dressed.

16
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:44,677
You can't look like that
when she gets here.

17
00:00:44,677 --> 00:00:46,212
Oh, she's not coming
for another hour.

18
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:47,201
Who?

19
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:48,142
Ronee's mother.

20
00:00:48,281 --> 00:00:49,382
Your grandmother.

21
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:51,284
Stop that.

22
00:00:51,284 --> 00:00:54,742
She's visiting with her
church group from Spokane.

23
00:00:55,121 --> 00:00:56,222
Yeah, and if
she sees me dressed like this,

24
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:57,524
she'd know
I spent the night

25
00:00:57,524 --> 00:00:59,359
and then she'd be carping
about it the whole weekend.

26
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:00,794
What, she doesn't approve
of premarital sex?

27
00:01:00,794 --> 00:01:03,126
Judging by the diving bell
she wore as a nightgown,

28
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,530
she wasn't real big
on postmarital sex, either.

29
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:10,270
Plus, I'm starting out
with one strike against me.

30
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:13,139
Mother still remembers
a night he drove me home

31
00:01:13,139 --> 00:01:16,142
after baby-sitting you
and Niles, 30 years ago...

32
00:01:16,142 --> 00:01:17,243
40 years ago.

33
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:18,812
I'm telling the story.

34
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:21,815
I was all weepy because
this guy had just dumped me.

35
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:23,806
And your father put his arm
around me just to be nice,

36
00:01:24,317 --> 00:01:25,819
and Mom saw it and she thought

37
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:27,582
he was trying
to "rob me of my virtue. "

38
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:29,422
Oh, that's crazy.

39
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:33,119
I know, like there was
anything left to rob.

40
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:34,427
Well, don't worry.

41
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:36,129
It's been a long time
since I've had to charm

42
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:37,430
the mother of one
of my girlfriends,

43
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,798
but believe me,
it's a skill you don't lose.

44
00:01:38,798 --> 00:01:42,135
Dr. Crane?

45
00:01:42,135 --> 00:01:43,124
Oh, Mrs. Lawrence.

46
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:44,637
How lovely
to see you again.

47
00:01:44,637 --> 00:01:46,127
Ronee should be here
any minute.

48
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:47,507
Yes, well, I'm a little early.

49
00:01:47,507 --> 00:01:48,769
Yes, um, there'?
no problem.

50
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:50,310
MRS. LA WRENCE:
I'm not inconveniencing you?

51
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,311
FRASIER:
No, not at all.

52
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:52,312
I could come back later.

53
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:53,609
I wouldn't think of it
.

54
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:56,206
Well, then
can I come in?

55
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:57,517
Yes... yes, of course.

56
00:01:57,517 --> 00:01:58,506
Where are my manners?

57
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:00,220
Oh, let me take
your coat.

58
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,321
Martin?

59
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:02,185
Hey, Ronee,
we were just...

60
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:05,348
Wait... Mrs. Lawrence?

61
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:08,795
Wow, you look wonderful.

62
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:09,863
Ronee isn't here at the moment,

63
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:11,353
so why don't I give you
a little tour.

64
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:12,866
We can start
in the kitchen.

65
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:14,367
Still all hands, I see.

66
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:15,766
Oh, sorry.

67
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,804
Well, Mrs. Lawrence,

68
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:18,872
the kitchen's
right here.

69
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:20,874
You know, you look
the same as you did

70
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:21,774
the last time I saw you.

71
00:02:21,774 --> 00:02:23,209
What are you saying,

72
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:24,699
that I looked
like this at 40?

73
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:32,552
(doorbell ringing)

74
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:33,541
I'll get it!

75
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:39,548
Wait, it's pouring rain
outside. Here.

76
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:47,367
Why, look who's here.

77
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:49,164
It's Ronee!

78
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:56,743
Hey, you two.
Hello. Hey, oh, Frasier,

79
00:02:56,743 --> 00:02:59,245
whatever plans you have
for this evening, cancel them.

80
00:02:59,245 --> 00:03:01,247
I am taking you
to a fantastic new restaurant.

81
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:02,749
Well, all right.

82
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:03,750
Where are we going?

83
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,650
To Chez Paul? Kobu?

84
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:07,216
Burger, Burger, Burger.

85
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,223
Dear God, you're serious.

86
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:11,524
I know what you're thinking.

87
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,226
Not two days ago
I was just like you--

88
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:15,228
too good to walk
into any one

89
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:16,729
of their 7 1 convenient
locations.

90
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:19,332
Then I dragged him
in there yesterday
for lunch

91
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:21,823
when I was craving
a bacon cheeseburger-
burger-burger.

92
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:23,825
He liked it so much,

93
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:26,573
he insisted we try
The Chick'n Bucket
for dinner.

94
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:28,541
I guess he's got
the fast-food bug.

95
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:32,312
And which one would that be--
E. coli?

96
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:33,613
Now, keep an open mind.

97
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:36,316
After all, you've embraced
the peasant cuisine

98
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:37,617
of Italy and France.

99
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:39,586
Why shun the peasants
in our own backyard?

100
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:41,287
You've changed, Niles.

101
00:03:41,287 --> 00:03:42,589
Oh, he hasn't changed that much.

102
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:44,284
He sent back his Big Slurp.

103
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:45,285
Good-bye, darling.

104
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:46,581
Thanks, Niles,
but, you know,

105
00:03:47,293 --> 00:03:48,282
I think I'll pass.

106
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:50,296
I'll spend the night in,
curled up with a good book.

107
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:52,298
I didn't get
much sleep last night.

108
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:53,299
So, Frasier,
what was going on

109
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:54,288
with you at work today?

110
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:55,295
You seemed
a little distracted.

111
00:03:55,602 --> 00:03:57,604
I'm not
really sure.

112
00:03:57,604 --> 00:04:00,607
t.
I can't stop thinking
about this woman I've me

113
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:03,610
It's my matchmaker,
of all people.

114
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,311
Well, now,
do you get a discount

115
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:07,614
if the matchmakerIf?
sets you up with herse

116
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:11,317
Sort of a...
floor model sort of thing?

117
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:13,319
I thought you were
kind of ticked off at her.

118
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:14,621
Well, I was
and then, um,

119
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:18,625
we had dinner together
last night, and...

120
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,616
Gosh, we were just so
comfortable with each other.

121
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:23,329
It was like we'd
known each other for ages.

122
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:24,631
So ask her out.

123
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:27,333
Oh, I can't.
She's got a boyfriend.

124
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:28,635
Truth be told,
I don't even know why

125
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:30,637
I'm so obsessed with her.
I barely even know her.

126
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:32,605
Niles, listen.

127
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:35,675
Is it possible that this is just
a case of transference?

128
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:37,677
Oh, interesting.

129
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:40,680
Uh, a matchmaker
is not unlike a therapist.

130
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,648
You, uh, confide in them
and seek guidance.

131
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:46,352
It's only natural you'd devea
little crush on her.

132
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:47,654
Yes, precisely.

133
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:49,355
How many times has
a patient fallen for you?

134
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:50,657
You first.

135
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:52,352
Niles, please,
don't be such a baby.

136
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:53,660
This is not a competition.

137
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:54,360
Eleven.

138
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,362
Thirteen.

139
00:04:56,362 --> 00:04:58,364
You know, this is really
a weight off of my shoulders.

140
00:04:58,364 --> 00:05:00,366
It's just simple transference.

141
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:01,668
Thank you, Niles.

142
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:03,369
Yes, well, I'm glad I could be of help.

143
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:04,671
You know, when I said
1 1 earlier, actually...

144
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:06,706
Too late, Niles.
Off you go.

145
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:08,675
(chuckles)

146
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:10,677
Well, that's
a relief.

147
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:11,678
Frasier.

148
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:13,680
Charlotte. Hi.

149
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,681
Uh, good
to see you.

150
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:16,672
I'd like you
to meet, uh...

151
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:20,386
Roz, Frasier's producer.

152
00:05:20,386 --> 00:05:22,388
Hi.

153
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:23,690
You know,
that was fun last night.

154
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:24,679
Yes, it was.
We should do it again sometime.

155
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:26,392
Oh, I'd love to.

156
00:05:26,392 --> 00:05:27,694
When I'm back in town.

157
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:29,395
I'm going camping.

158
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:30,396
I didn't realize you were
an outdoors woman.

159
00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:32,398
I'm not.

160
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:33,387
Last time I camped out
was for Van Halen tickets.

161
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,702
But, you know,
Frank loves it

162
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:37,704
and I'll do
anything once.

163
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:40,406
Oh, would you mind watering

164
00:05:40,406 --> 00:05:42,408
my office plants
while I'm away?

165
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:43,710
I'd be glad to.

166
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,411
Oh, gosh, you
are the best.

167
00:05:45,411 --> 00:05:46,412
Thanks.

168
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:47,714
Um, anyone
need a refill?

169
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:49,705
No, thanks.
No.

170
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:54,710
Transference my ass.

171
00:05:55,421 --> 00:05:56,410
You've got it bad.

172
00:05:58,424 --> 00:05:59,413
All right,
what am I supposed to do?

173
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,427
Well, fight for her.

174
00:06:01,427 --> 00:06:02,729
I mean, who
is this Frank guy?

175
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:03,718
Oh, I don't know.

176
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,432
Some kind of
environmental activist.

177
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:08,434
That's
your competition?

178
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:11,437
Some tree-hugging geek?
Come on.

179
00:06:11,437 --> 00:06:13,735
You're one of
the most eligible
bachelors in town...

180
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,431
in your age range.

181
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:20,747
Charlotte.

182
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:22,749
Hi, honey.

183
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:24,444
You're screwed.

184
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:27,754
Frank,
this is Frasier,

185
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:28,755
the one I was
telling you about.

186
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:30,456
Hi. how
are you?

187
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:31,457
And his
producer, Roz.

188
00:06:31,457 --> 00:06:32,458
Hi.

189
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:34,527
So, I understand
you're going camping.

190
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:35,425
Yeah, I raised some
eagle hatchlings

191
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:37,430
when their mother
was killed by a hunter,

192
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:39,432
and now we're going to go
release them in the wild.

193
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:40,933
How can you tell
when it's time?

194
00:06:40,933 --> 00:06:44,437
Well, one of them
ate his landlord's cat.

195
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:46,928
You know, if they're still hungry,
my dad has a dog.

196
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,441
(laughing)

197
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:49,442
You're funny.

198
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:50,932
Well...

199
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:52,945
I know a lady who would
love your sense of humor.

200
00:06:52,945 --> 00:06:54,447
She's a ranger
up on Mt. Rainier.

201
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:55,715
She comes down every
couple months

202
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:58,518
for supplies if you'd
like to meet her.

203
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:00,486
Well, uh, thanks,
but, you know,

204
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:01,817
I haven't had much luck

205
00:07:02,488 --> 00:07:04,479
with the women
of the Parks Department.

206
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:05,813
(laughing)

207
00:07:16,502 --> 00:07:18,504
Wow, Roz,
did you feel that?

208
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:21,507
The entire room changed
when we walked in.

209
00:07:21,507 --> 00:07:23,498
It's like animals
in the wild

210
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:26,512
sensing a predator
had arrived.

211
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:28,503
Good. I like
that you're confident.

212
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:30,004
No, I was talking
about you.

213
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:34,520
Okay, now look,
this is the drill.

214
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,523
I brought you here to get
your mind off Charlotte.

215
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:39,525
Everyone's here
for the same reason.

216
00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:42,028
So just pick someone
and be yourself.

217
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:45,031
Okay, um, what name
should I use?

218
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:46,032
Excuse me.

219
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:48,034
Another Cosmo, please.

220
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:49,023
Buy that drink.

221
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:50,536
Right,
a faint heart...

222
00:07:50,536 --> 00:07:52,038
Buy the drink.

223
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:54,540
Barkeep, uh,
that one's on me.

224
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,042
If you don't mind.

225
00:07:56,042 --> 00:08:00,035
Mind? Why do you think
I said it so loud?

226
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:02,548
What do I do now?

227
00:08:02,548 --> 00:08:03,537
Just don't be
so nervous.

228
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,551
And don't worry.
I won't leave you

229
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:06,552
until you make
a connection.

230
00:08:06,552 --> 00:08:07,553
Hi.

231
00:08:07,553 --> 00:08:09,555
Or I do.

232
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:12,558
Uh... hi.

233
00:08:12,558 --> 00:08:14,060
I'm Dr. Frasier Crane.

234
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,061
Kim.

235
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:16,562
So, you're a doctor?

236
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:18,064
Yes, I am.

237
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:19,065
I have a small practice
here in town, and...

238
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:20,566
Do you do collagen,

239
00:08:20,566 --> 00:08:24,070
because I could barter
frequent flyer miles.

240
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,072
No, I'm not
that kind of doctor.

241
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:27,061
.
I'm a psychiatrist

242
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:29,075
Oh. Oh!

243
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:32,078
You've probably got me
figured out already.

244
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:33,579
No, no.

245
00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:35,581
I haven't even got you
on the couch yet.

246
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:37,083
Oh, my God.

247
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:38,072
Oh, I'm sorry. That was too aggressive.

248
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:40,586
No, no, I had a fortune
cookie this morning

249
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:42,588
that said I was going
to meet a doctor.

250
00:08:42,588 --> 00:08:45,580
I was afraid I was sick.

251
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:48,594
Well, you look awfully
healthy to me.

252
00:08:48,594 --> 00:08:50,084
Oh, my God.

253
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:51,097
Dear God, too
aggressive again?

254
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:52,098
I'm sorry.
No.

255
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:53,599
No, I love
this song.

256
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:57,103
Come on, Dr. Frasier,
loosen up.

257
00:08:57,103 --> 00:09:02,108
I'm sorry. What's your
first name again?

258
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:04,599
The first few
months I was a wreck.

259
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:07,113
We were engaged.

260
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:09,615
At least... I was.

261
00:09:09,615 --> 00:09:13,107
But now I know I'm
ready to move on.

262
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:17,123
Really, really ready.

263
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:18,624
You know, it's funny.

264
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:20,626
I'm actually trying
to get over

265
00:09:20,626 --> 00:09:23,629
someone myself,
in a manner of speaking.

266
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:26,632
And you thought she
was "the one, " right?

267
00:09:26,632 --> 00:09:27,621
She may have been,

268
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:29,624
but I'm just trying to put her
out of my mind right now.

269
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:32,638
I must say, you're proving to
a delightful distraction.

270
00:09:32,638 --> 00:09:35,641
Oh, well, that's not the nicest thing

271
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:38,144
anybody's ever called
me in a bar,

272
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:40,635
.
but it's not the worst

273
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:42,148
This is fun,

274
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:45,151
but I'm kind
of thinking that

275
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:51,157
I'd like to go someplace a little less crowded.

276
00:09:51,157 --> 00:09:53,159
Okay, uh, well...
thank you.

277
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:54,649
I enjoyed our time
together.

278
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:58,653
No, I meant someplace
a little more private.

279
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:00,666
No, I understand completely.
I take no offense.

280
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:02,156
Your place.

281
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:04,158
Oh, yes, yes, indeed.

282
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:07,173
Well, should we go
together to my place...?

283
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:08,674
Well, you must have
your own car,

284
00:10:08,674 --> 00:10:10,176
so I could
give you directions,

285
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:11,666
or, uh, well, we could
drive together

286
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:13,679
and then I could
drive you back here,

287
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:15,181
or we could drive together

288
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:16,671
and then you could
get a cab back here...

289
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:19,185
I don't care
how we get there.

290
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:21,676
Let's just get there.

291
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:37,659
(doorbell rings)

292
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,666
(music playing)

293
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:44,340
It's unlocked.

294
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:45,642
It's unsafe.

295
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,134
Oh, dear God.

296
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:49,849
Anyone could walk in.

297
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:52,118
What the hell
are you two doing here?

298
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:53,152
We came
to cheer you up

299
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:54,854
with some
late-night fast food.

300
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:56,155
If anything's gonna
make you forget a woman,

301
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:57,156
it's a Big Double Juicy.

302
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:58,024
Please take it.

303
00:10:58,024 --> 00:10:59,992
If you don't, he will.

304
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:01,694
I've created a monster.

305
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:03,996
He's already had
two chimichangas

306
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:06,999
and a '"You Ain't Nothing
But a Corn Dog. "

307
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:09,702
All for less
than four dollars.

308
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:12,038
Where has this food
been all my life?

309
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:14,774
On the end of a coroner'
s artery scraper.

310
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:16,342
What the hell has
happened to you?

311
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,878
You've devoted your whole life to
honing your standards

312
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:21,313
only to succumb to the fast,
the cheap and the tasty.

313
00:11:21,313 --> 00:11:25,017
Sorry. I turned the wrong way

314
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,786
coming out
of the elevator.

315
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:28,913
Oh, hello.

316
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:34,193
Kim, this is my brother Niles
and his wife Daphne.

317
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,227
They were
just leaving.

318
00:11:35,227 --> 00:11:37,229
Charmed.

319
00:11:37,229 --> 00:11:39,732
Well, I see I have
my big Double Juicy

320
00:11:39,732 --> 00:11:40,733
and you have yours.

321
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:42,034
Yes. Good night.

322
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:45,697
Did somebody here
have a chimichanga?

323
00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:46,872
See? I told you.

324
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:48,237
It's coming out
of your pores.

325
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:52,705
Wow! Nice place.

326
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:54,880
You really
are a doctor.

327
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,383
Yes. Would you
like the tour?

328
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:58,884
I don't know.

329
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:01,387
What do you want
to show me?

330
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:04,390
.
I don't know. Uh..

331
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,393
What do
you want to see?

332
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,895
What would you
like me to see?

333
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:12,261
Whatever you
came here to see.

334
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:16,736
And what did
I come here to see?

335
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,037
Is there
an end to this?

336
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:20,039
Because I...
I'm starting

337
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:22,041
to feel redundant
on my part.

338
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:26,045
Let's just
have some fun.

339
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:28,912
You are delightfully
single-minded.

340
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:30,307
Would you care
for some wine?

341
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:31,939
Sounds great.

342
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,253
We've both had
a rough time lately.

343
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:37,256
How about we go
a little crazy tonight?

344
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,958
I like
the sound of that.

345
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:42,018
I've got a little outfit
you might like.

346
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:46,499
The littler it is,
the more I like it.

347
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:49,502
I love it when I say something

348
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:52,494
and then you
say something funny.

349
00:12:56,008 --> 00:12:57,498
.
I'll tell you what

350
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:59,445
If you'd like to,

351
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,436
you can change
right in here,

352
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:05,951
and maybe I'll whip up
a little surprise of my own.

353
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:07,453
Okay.

354
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:08,943
(squeaks)
Oh!

355
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:13,459
When I met you tonight,

356
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:17,828
I had no idea
what a bad boy you were.

357
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:21,500
You know what bad
boys need, don't you?

358
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:25,037
A spanking, right?

359
00:13:25,037 --> 00:13:26,539
..
That or.

360
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:28,905
a good tongue-lashing.

361
00:13:29,074 --> 00:13:30,905
You did it again!

362
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:35,848
Oh, my goodness!

363
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:37,850
What's going on?

364
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:40,853
I thought you were out
for the evening, for God's sake.

365
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:42,154
We came back
for dessert.

366
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,849
Obviously, you
got a jump on us.

367
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:46,959
This is horrible.

368
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,961
I... I'm so sorry.
I met, um...

369
00:13:48,961 --> 00:13:50,462
Kim.

370
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:52,031
...Kim at a bar
earlier this evening

371
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:53,965
and, obviously, we hit it off.

372
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,391
Yeah, we get it.

373
00:13:55,868 --> 00:13:58,132
There's a little coffee shop
on the corner.

374
00:13:58,437 --> 00:14:00,472
Why don't we go
there for dessert?

375
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:02,474
You may get away with this now,
young man,

376
00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:03,338
but once I'm your mother...

377
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:04,200
Oh, get out!

378
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:12,551
I would say,
"Perhaps another time, "

379
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:14,653
but that
outfit goes

380
00:14:14,653 --> 00:14:17,122
a long way toward
recapturing the mood.

381
00:14:17,122 --> 00:14:19,625
Good. Now, why don't
you just relax,

382
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:22,116
and I'll go find some ice
for our wines.

383
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:27,120
(doorbell rings)

384
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:28,622
Oh, good heavens!

385
00:14:30,135 --> 00:14:31,136
Hello.

386
00:14:31,136 --> 00:14:32,638
I'm sorry
to bother you.

387
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:34,139
I just need
my house keys.

388
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:36,130
I... I... I thought
you were camping.

389
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:39,144
Uh... come on in.

390
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:41,146
Gosh, I'm sorry about the stench in the hall.

391
00:14:41,146 --> 00:14:42,648
That would be me.

392
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:45,150
I had a little run-in
with a skunk.

393
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:48,517
I thought I could scare him off
if I threw my keys at him.

394
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:49,955
Come on in.

395
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:51,457
You really don't want me to.

396
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:53,459
As it is now, I'm going
to have to sell my car.

397
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:55,094
What is all over your chest?

398
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:59,131
Okay, should
I...? Hello.

399
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:01,497
Okay. Oh, I got it.

400
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:03,466
Sorry. Charlotte,
this is Kim.

401
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:04,958
Kim, this
is Charlotte.

402
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:07,998
Boy, I've met more people
in this apartment

403
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,942
than I did at the bar.

404
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:13,445
I really didn't
mean to interrupt.

405
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:15,936
If I could get my keys and use
your powder room really fast.

406
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:17,950
Right.
It's right here.

407
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,440
And I'll get those for you.

408
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:23,455
Uh, Kim...

409
00:15:23,455 --> 00:15:25,946
I'm terribly sorry about this.

410
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:30,462
I'm afraid it's just not going
to work out for us tonight.

411
00:15:30,462 --> 00:15:32,564
She's "the one, " isn't she?

412
00:15:32,564 --> 00:15:36,068
Yeah. Uh... Iisten.

413
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:38,570
This has nothing to do with you,
you know.

414
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:40,060
I've had a lovely time
this evening.

415
00:15:40,572 --> 00:15:41,561
Me, too.

416
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:44,076
Maybe it's just as well.

417
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:47,568
I'm... I'm
lactose intolerant.

418
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:53,040
Good luck.

419
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:01,560
Your keys.

420
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,062
Thanks.

421
00:16:03,062 --> 00:16:04,051
Where's your friend?

422
00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:05,564
She left.

423
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:07,066
Oh, I'm sorry.

424
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:10,569
I didn't mean
to spoil your night.

425
00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:11,437
You didn't.

426
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:12,699
Yes. Yes, I did.

427
00:16:13,205 --> 00:16:14,194
I spoil everything.

428
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:15,708
Oh, now, don't go there.

429
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,209
But it's true.

430
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:19,211
No, no. I mean,
don't go there.

431
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:20,713
Come sit over there.

432
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:22,203
You'll be
more comfortable.

433
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:25,718
I spoiled your evening,
I spoiled my clothes,

434
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:28,420
I spoiled my
whole relationship.

435
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:29,421
Oh?

436
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:31,423
Frank and I had
a huge fight.

437
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:34,126
,
He was getting impatient
with me because, excuse me

438
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:37,129
I'm not exactly a pioneer woma
and I started snapping back.

439
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:39,120
The whole thing
went downhill from there.

440
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:41,133
I'm sure it wasn't as
bad as all that.

441
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:44,261
I dropped the cooler
on one of the hatchlings.

442
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:49,208
You know, maybe you
could use a little wine.

443
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:50,607
I could,
but look at me.

444
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:53,112
I can't stay in
your house like this.

445
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:54,613
Okay, I tell you what.

446
00:16:54,613 --> 00:16:56,615
I have an eight-jet
whirlpool bath

447
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:59,118
that you are free
to revive yourself in.

448
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:02,621
I can get cleaned up
and make us some snacks.

449
00:17:02,621 --> 00:17:04,123
All right? And, uh...

450
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:07,659
You know, actually, I have
an endangered condor pte

451
00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:10,662
that I've been saving
for just such an occasion.

452
00:17:10,662 --> 00:17:13,153
It's not funny.

453
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:17,636
More wine?

454
00:17:17,636 --> 00:17:19,104
Thanks.

455
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:21,572
This is my idea
of camping.

456
00:17:23,575 --> 00:17:26,567
I'm not much of
an outdoor man myself.

457
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:31,817
In college,
I got lost on a nature hike.

458
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:34,319
After screaming for 45 minutes,

459
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:37,322
I was finally rescued
by a Brownie troop.

460
00:17:37,322 --> 00:17:38,311
(laughing)

461
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:40,325
I still know
some of their songs.

462
00:17:40,325 --> 00:17:41,493
(laughing)

463
00:17:41,493 --> 00:17:43,195
I still can't believe

464
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:46,221
I haven't found the right woma
for you yet.

465
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,100
Well, there's no rush.

466
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,436
I'm enjoying the search.

467
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:52,165
You're so sweet.

468
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:55,262
You're sweet yourself.

469
00:17:58,143 --> 00:18:00,134
Charlotte...

470
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:03,148
I hope
you won't think

471
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:05,343
this is too forward
of me, but...

472
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:09,455
A promising relationship
doesn't come along very often,

473
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:13,152
and when it does, it's worth
sticking your neck out for.

474
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,218
What I'm saying is...

475
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:21,100
Good Lord!

476
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,601
He's with another one!

477
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,103
For heaven's sake!

478
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,105
What are you doing
to me, boy?

479
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:29,597
Maybe I'll just go get
those sweats you offered
and get out of here.

480
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,100
All right, Veronica,
we've had dessert.

481
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,613
We've dropped him off.
Can we go now?

482
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:36,115
No.

483
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:39,118
I don't want to spend
another moment in this house.

484
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,420
Well, fine, then, you
go, but I am staying
here with Marty.

485
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:43,422
Oh, oh, sure,
okay, uh, Ronee,

486
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:45,124
I'll just make up
the couch for you.

487
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,425
Just drop it, Marty.

488
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:48,518
Yes, Mother,
we are sleeping together.

489
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,295
And he's not the first...

490
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:51,663
or the second.

491
00:18:51,663 --> 00:18:53,665
In fact, I'm well
into double digits now.

492
00:18:53,665 --> 00:18:55,834
Okay, we got
the picture.
Look, I...

493
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:57,836
.
I'm sorry. I-I know
you're upset, but I just..

494
00:18:57,836 --> 00:18:58,837
I can't live a lie anymore.

495
00:18:58,837 --> 00:19:00,828
For God's sakes,
I'm in my 40s.

496
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:01,829
What are
you talking about?

497
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:03,342
You haven't been
in your 40s...

498
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:04,832
All right, good
night, Mother.

499
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:07,779
I'll see you
in the morning.

500
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:09,770
Well, if you're a good boy
, maybe you'll get

501
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:11,772
to spend the summer
with your grandma.

502
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:23,462
Thanks for the sweats.

503
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:27,166
And about before...

504
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,828
I think I know
what you were trying to say.

505
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:34,173
You do?
Yes.

506
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:37,676
A promising relationship
is worth fighting for.

507
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:40,179
So I called Frank
and apologized,

508
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,942
and he's on his way home.

509
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:46,940
Thank you for being there
for me tonight.

510
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:50,310
You are such a good friend.

511
00:19:51,823 --> 00:19:55,327
So, uh...
I'll see you Monday?

512
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:56,828
Maybe we can get
some coffee?

513
00:19:56,828 --> 00:19:58,295
Right.

514
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:01,667
(door shuts)

515
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:04,369
I brought a little dessert back.

516
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:07,532
.
I don't suppose
there's any whipped cream left

517
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:11,332
Sorry. No.

518
00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:16,837
You all right?

519
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:18,550
No.

520
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:21,486
Want to talk about it?

521
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:24,978
Whoo! I got to get
this chair cleaned.

522
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:29,895
She doesn't want me.

523
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,362
She wants somebody else.

524
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:33,229
I don't have a chance.

525
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:35,393
Oh, I'm sorry.

526
00:20:37,703 --> 00:20:39,304
That's the second one, right?

527
00:20:39,304 --> 00:20:40,396
Yeah.

528
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:43,999
So, uh, what
are you going to do?

529
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:45,432
Oh, that's a good question.

530
00:20:45,844 --> 00:20:47,746
What am I going to do?

531
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:51,016
I suppose I could pine over her
for the next several weeks,

532
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:54,353
make myself more miserable
every day...

533
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:58,590
or I could do the sensible thing
and just...

534
00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:59,887
Iet her go.

535
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:04,258
Excuse me.

536
00:21:16,074 --> 00:21:18,474
Hi, Charlotte.
It's Frasier.

537
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:21,413
Um...

538
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:24,314
about coffee on Monday--
let's just forget that.

539
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:29,318
How about lunch instead?
