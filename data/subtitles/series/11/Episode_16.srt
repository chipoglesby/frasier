1
00:00:09,209 --> 00:00:13,213
(symphony playing on stereo)

2
00:00:13,213 --> 00:00:14,202
(turns up volume)

3
00:00:14,547 --> 00:00:16,105
(orchestra playing softly)

4
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:23,612
(orchestra begins loud,
cadential flourish)

5
00:00:28,628 --> 00:00:31,529
(orchestra plays final chord)

6
00:00:32,065 --> 00:00:33,133
Boo!

7
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:35,124
(high-pitched scream)

8
00:00:35,235 --> 00:00:37,203
(laughter)

9
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:39,572
That is not funny!

10
00:00:39,572 --> 00:00:42,234
You don't sneak up on someone and startle them.

11
00:00:43,777 --> 00:00:45,278
and secondly,
I only did it to prove a point.

12
00:00:45,278 --> 00:00:47,644
And you called it--
he does scream like a woman.

13
00:00:49,582 --> 00:00:52,449
I do not scream like a woman.
It was a manly, throaty wail.

14
00:00:52,752 --> 00:00:54,320
Frasier, you may want
to call security.

15
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,822
As I got off the elevator,

16
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:58,313
I heard a woman screaming
hysterically.

17
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:01,194
That was me.

18
00:01:01,194 --> 00:01:03,196
I was innocently conducting
some Brahms

19
00:01:03,196 --> 00:01:05,096
when our madcap father
decided to startle me.

20
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:07,801
Oh, quit whining.
I used to scare you kids all the time

21
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:09,803
when we went camping
-- you used to love it.

22
00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:11,304
Remember the story about the couple

23
00:01:11,304 --> 00:01:12,794
making out in the
car who got slashed

24
00:01:13,306 --> 00:01:14,796
by the killer
with the hook?
Yes, I remember

25
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:18,812
I couldn't kiss a woman in a c
until I was 30.

26
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:20,814
Yeah, well, your father
doesn't have that problem--

27
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:22,816
Mr. Reclining Bucket Seats.

28
00:01:22,816 --> 00:01:23,817
(lascivious growl)

29
00:01:23,817 --> 00:01:25,307
You want me to scream again?

30
00:01:27,187 --> 00:01:29,155
Dad, when'd you get
the new cane?

31
00:01:29,155 --> 00:01:30,247
Oh, Ronee got it for me.

32
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,258
Yeah, he's too young
for that old man can
e.

33
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:33,748
This is much
more his style
.

34
00:01:34,227 --> 00:01:37,197
Give me a top hat,
and I'm Fred Astaire.

35
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:40,223
Add a monocle,
and you're Mr. Peanut.

36
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:46,270
Hey, Frasier. Coulrophobia?

37
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:48,708
I have a patient
who suffers from it.
What is it?

38
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:50,300
It's a very rare disorder,

39
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:52,377
a crippling fear of clowns
.

40
00:01:52,645 --> 00:01:54,613
Yes, I'm treating a pediatric nurse
who is terrified

41
00:01:54,814 --> 00:01:57,383
every time one comes to visit the child
ren at her hospital.

42
00:01:57,383 --> 00:01:58,885
It's almost cost her her job.

43
00:01:58,885 --> 00:02:00,284
Poor thing.
We're making
great progress.

44
00:02:00,653 --> 00:02:02,722
Through some rather
groundbreaking techniques

45
00:02:02,722 --> 00:02:04,224
I've devised, I think
we're close to a cure.

46
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:05,725
Really?
Yes.

47
00:02:05,725 --> 00:02:08,717
I wouldn't be surprised
if this may turn out to be my...

48
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:11,231
clowning achievement.

49
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:12,220
(laughing)

50
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:14,190
That sounded better
in your head, didn't it?

51
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:17,568
Vastly.

52
00:02:17,737 --> 00:02:19,339
Well, I don't blame her
for hating clowns.

53
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:20,328
They're weird and creepy.

54
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,841
That was one
of the reasons

55
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:23,331
I never took you kids
to the circus.

56
00:02:23,676 --> 00:02:24,734
Which I always resented.

57
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:27,736
You know how much I wanted
to be a trapeze artist.

58
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:30,583
I even decorated a unitard

59
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:32,585
in the style
of the Flying Wallendas

60
00:02:32,585 --> 00:02:35,281
to wear when we visited
the big top.

61
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:38,191
That was the other reason.

62
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:41,361
Well, I'll go check on dinner.

63
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:43,229
I'm gonna have
to make this
an early evening.

64
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:45,231
I'm leaving in
the morning to
visit my mother.

65
00:02:45,231 --> 00:02:46,220
She moved last
year to Spokane.

66
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:47,734
I remember your mom.

67
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:50,498
She used to chaperone
our dances, right?
Oh, yeah.

68
00:02:50,703 --> 00:02:53,773
She also taught
Sunday school andled the church choir.

69
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:55,775
day
Must've been a very windy

70
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:58,266
when the apple fell
from that tree.

71
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,487
(music box playing
"Pop! Goes the Weasel")

72
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:08,888
You're doing fine, Mimi.

73
00:03:08,888 --> 00:03:11,880
There's nothing to be afraid of.

74
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:13,893
Right.
Just a tiny,

75
00:03:13,893 --> 00:03:15,395
inanimate piece of plastic--

76
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:16,885
it couldn't
possibly hurt you.

77
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:18,730
(music continues)
I know.

78
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:20,399
You're doing great.

79
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:21,700
I feel good.

80
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:25,203
(screaming hysterically)

81
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:27,236
(gasping
and whimpering)

82
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:30,677
Much better.

83
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:31,678
(chuckles)

84
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:33,680
Really?
Yes, yes.

85
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,383
You're still in the
room; you didn't throw up.

86
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:38,372
That's a big improvement.

87
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:41,381
All right, now...
give me your hand.

88
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:44,923
Here's the tiny little hat.

89
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:47,694
Tiny little hat, right.

90
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:50,396
And the big red nose.

91
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:51,397
A big red nose.

92
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:53,262
Now, Mimi,

93
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:54,558
is there anything
you'd like to say

94
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:55,894
to our little clown friend?

95
00:03:56,302 --> 00:03:57,403
Please don't kill me!

96
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:59,394
!
.
No

97
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:00,970
No, Mimi.

98
00:04:01,374 --> 00:04:03,243
Oh, I-I mean, uh...

99
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:06,610
you're my friend,
and I like you.

100
00:04:06,846 --> 00:04:07,904
Excellent, Mimi.
(laughs)

101
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:10,405
(chuckling):
All right, then.

102
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:12,375
Now, tomorrow

103
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:14,312
we will take our biggest step yet.

104
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:17,257
No, I really don't think...
No, no, I...
You are ready.

105
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,417
You are.

106
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:21,427
In the safety
of this environment,

107
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:24,731
you'll watch me transform myseIf

108
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:28,428
into a real live clown.

109
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:34,574
I will apply the makeup...

110
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:37,577
and then I'll put on
the clown suit

111
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:40,569
and the big funny shoes,

112
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:43,312
and time permitting,

113
00:04:43,516 --> 00:04:45,609
I will make animal balloons.

114
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:50,318
And you really think
that'll work?

115
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:51,557
or
As long as you don't ask f

116
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:53,047
anything too complicated,
like a giraffe.

117
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:56,796
up.
Well, our time is

118
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:58,787
Um... all right,
then, Mimi,

119
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,301
I will see you tomorrow,

120
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,791
and rest assured,
I will talk you

121
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,804
through every step of the way.

122
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,306
There's nothing to be afraid of.

123
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,807
There willbe no surprises.

124
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,342
(screams)

125
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:11,606
(chuckling) :
I'm so... so sorry!

126
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:13,446
Here. There he goes.
All right, now.

127
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:15,448
I will see you
later, then.
All right.

128
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:16,938
(screams)

129
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:18,451
)
(chuckling

130
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:20,453
Again, I'm so sorry--
little fellow really is

131
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:21,442
he?
full of mischief, isn't

132
00:05:21,954 --> 00:05:23,456
You mean you're not
controlling it?!

133
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:26,323
.
Yes. Yes,
of course I am

134
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:28,118
Anyway, I will, uh,
see you tomorrow.

135
00:05:28,594 --> 00:05:29,583
Yeah.
Double session.

136
00:05:29,862 --> 00:05:31,955
(whimpering)
(chuckles)

137
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,004
Boo!
(screeches)

138
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:52,006
(laughing)

139
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,717
What is the
matter with you?

140
00:05:56,422 --> 00:05:59,721
You keep standing in empty rooms
with your back to the door.

141
00:06:00,426 --> 00:06:01,415
an.
I'm only hum

142
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:03,730
Oh, I wish Ronee
could've seen that one.

143
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,425
I'm glad that your little
girlfriend is making you

144
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:06,733
feel young again,
but you're acting

145
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:08,434
Iike an irresponsible
adolescent.

146
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:09,423
(mocking) :
Irresponsible adolescent.

147
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:10,634
Mimicking me now.

148
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:12,904
(mocking) :
Mimicking me now.

149
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:15,699
Stop it. Did you specifically
come down here to torture me?

150
00:06:16,008 --> 00:06:17,577
No. I'm picking up Niles
for a movie,

151
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:19,545
but he's still got someone in his office.

152
00:06:19,612 --> 00:06:22,410
Yes, as do I, unfortunately.
Now, off you go.

153
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:24,650
Oh... when did you forget
how to have fun?

154
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,152
You've turned into
such a fuddy-duddy.

155
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:27,653
Well, forgive me

156
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:29,644
if I prefer humor
of a more elevated level.

157
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:31,157
,
I tell you

158
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:33,659
I might actually enjoy
one of your little japes one day

159
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:35,161
if you could come up
with something

160
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:37,152
with a bit more wit
and sophistication.

161
00:06:44,837 --> 00:06:46,439
(phone ringing)

162
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:48,174
Hello?

163
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:49,442
Yes, well,
I'm afraid my calendar's

164
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:51,511
rather booked right now.

165
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:52,678
Well, all right.

166
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:55,112
I suppose I could try
to squeeze you in somewhere.

167
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:59,483
Uh... yes, uh,
and your last name, please?

168
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,489
Rection. That's unusual.

169
00:07:03,489 --> 00:07:06,092
And your first name?

170
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,083
That's not funny, either, Dad.

171
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,535
Oh, hello, Roz
Hi.

172
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:16,832
Oh, thanks for
bringing that over
.No problem.

173
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:18,538
I'm warning you, though,

174
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:19,835
that clown makeup is
a bitch to get off.

175
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:21,697
,
I wore it
for Alice's birthday party

176
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,710
and for a whole week afterwards,
I looked like a Kabuki hooker.

177
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:26,200
Oh, yes,
that was around

178
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:28,714
the time
of the Seabee Awards ceremony.

179
00:07:28,714 --> 00:07:31,717
I remember, you looked rather
comically made-up that night.

180
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:32,706
I'd gotten it off
by then.

181
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:36,856
Yoo-hoo, Frasier.

182
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:39,552
Don't be afraid.
I'm coming in the door.

183
00:07:41,994 --> 00:07:43,029
Very funny, Dad.

184
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:44,018
Roz, do you think it's funny

185
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:45,531
when someone sneaks up
behind you

186
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:47,033
?
.
and jolts you out of your skin

187
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:48,022
--
Let me guess

188
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:50,729
somebody screamed like a woman.

189
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:54,563
Yes, all right.
Good night, Roz.
Bye.

190
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,576
I thought you were
having dinner with Niles.

191
00:07:56,576 --> 00:07:58,578
He canceled.
Something else came up.

192
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:01,080
I'm just gonna watch
the game in my room.
All right.

193
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,082
But don't worry.
If I come out for a beer,

194
00:08:03,082 --> 00:08:04,083
I'll call ahead.

195
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:05,585
Wouldn't want you to think

196
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:08,076
there was an intruder
in the house.

197
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:10,988
It's about ten years too late for that.

198
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:24,737
Dad, I'm going to go out
for a while!

199
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:26,239
See you later!

200
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:28,741
MARTIN:
All right, see you!

201
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:30,231
(jingles keys)

202
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,713
(rings doorbell repeatedly)

203
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,841
(vicious yell)
(screams)

204
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:38,332
(laughing)

205
00:09:40,646 --> 00:09:44,183
Oh, you were right, Dad.
That's hilarious!

206
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:46,174
Not such
a fuddy-duddy now, am I?

207
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:48,619
That's quite
a comeback, Dad.

208
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:50,611
A heart attack.
Come on, get up.

209
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:53,626
Dad.

210
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:56,329
Dad, you can get up now.

211
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:57,819
Dad!

212
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:04,631
Frasier.

213
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:05,905
Niles...

214
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:06,894
Dad?
How's

215
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,375
Well, he's resting,
he's stable, his
color is good.

217
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:14,380
How did this happen?

218
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:19,613
Well, there's so many factors
in a case like this, Niles.

219
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:23,685
It's impossible to pinpoint
any one cause in particular.

220
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:27,660
Why are you dressed
like that?

221
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,649
Hmm?

222
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:30,963
.
Well, uh..

223
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:32,665
Oh, all right.

224
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:34,656
You remember my patient
with the clown phobia?

225
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,662
Oh, yes, of course.
I'm sorry.

227
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:40,640
Frasier, you
feel terrible--

228
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,642
I was supposed to have
dinner with him tonight

229
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:43,631
and I canceled on him.

230
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:45,645
I would have been there
when it happened,

231
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:48,414
but no, I had to try out
those new bath emollients.

232
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:50,950
There's no point
in trying to assign blame

233
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,815
.
at a time like this, Niles

234
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:55,053
We must remember that.

235
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:57,889
You probably
saved his life.

236
00:10:58,124 --> 00:11:00,159
Our father had
a heart attack.

237
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,922
This man
saved his life.

238
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:04,196
Well, I'm sure you would
have done the same thing

239
00:11:04,196 --> 00:11:05,831
if you were in
my shoes, Niles.

240
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:08,868
Well, not these
shoes, of course.

241
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:09,766
(chuckles)

242
00:11:10,102 --> 00:11:10,932
Hey.

243
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:11,694
Oh, Roz, hi.

245
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,665
He's fine now,
thanks to Frasier's
grace under pressure.

246
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:18,040
MAN:
You know, they say

247
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:20,446
the first few minutes
are critical.

248
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:21,936
Did you give him
an aspirin?

249
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:23,406
Uh... yes, I did.

250
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:26,352
He's been taking care
of his dad for ten years.

251
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:27,842
God bless him.
What a good son.

252
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:31,290
Uh, excuse me,
Dr. Crane.

253
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:33,281
I have to verify
the paramedics' report.

254
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:34,782
Around 7:00 this evening

255
00:11:35,294 --> 00:11:37,296
you pretended to leave
your apartment...

256
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:39,298
Yes, that's right.
It's all there.

257
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:40,299
.
Off you go

258
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:41,288
Then you dressed up
like a clown

259
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:43,302
and lured your father
into the living room

260
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:45,805
where you leapt out
waving a meat cleaver

261
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:47,796
causing him to collapse.

262
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:56,712
You scared him on purpose?

263
00:11:57,149 --> 00:11:58,184
It was a joke.

264
00:11:58,184 --> 00:12:00,186
You know how much
he hates clowns.

265
00:12:00,186 --> 00:12:01,744
My father hates clowns.

266
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:04,785
Yes, well, it was only meant
as a playful little jolt.

267
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:08,949
Why didn't you just
throw a toaster in his tub?

268
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:09,924
Dr. Crane.

269
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:11,026
Oh, yes.

270
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:12,364
Your father's doing well.

271
00:12:12,364 --> 00:12:14,229
He appears to have suffered
a mild cardiac event.

272
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,202
?
.
And what
does that mean exactly

273
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:17,066
Basically,
it's a warning.

274
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:19,801
He'll need to change
his diet, start exercising.

275
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:21,439
Anyway, he should be able
to go home tomorrow.

276
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:23,739
What relief.
He's going to be okay.

277
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:25,005
No thanks to you.

278
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:26,812
NILES:
Look at you.

279
00:12:26,812 --> 00:12:28,848
You just stand there
with a smile on your face.

280
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:31,316
That's makeup, you idiot.

281
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:37,753
May I remind you all
that this was an accident.

282
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:40,059
It was meant as
a harmless amusement.

283
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:43,062
I will not stand here
and be demonized for this.

284
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:44,757
!
.
I am not a monster

285
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:47,760
)
(screaming

286
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:50,427
(screaming continues)

287
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:01,847
Okay, Dad, just
take it easy.

288
00:13:01,847 --> 00:13:02,836
I'm fine.

289
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:05,140
Hey, there's my guy.

290
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:08,087
Daddy's home fro
m the little vacation

291
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:10,790
your brother Frasier
sent me on.

292
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,792
All right, Dad.

293
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:15,094
Daphne's on her way over
to join us

294
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:17,096
for a nice
heart-smart dinner.

295
00:13:17,096 --> 00:13:20,099
Oh, and, Dad, you really
should take a look

296
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:22,966
at this list the hospital
sent home with us.

297
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:25,337
Now, the foods that have
a little picture

298
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:28,795
of a smiling heart next to them
are good for you.

299
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:30,442
Yeah, I cracked
that code already.

300
00:13:30,442 --> 00:13:32,945
Frasier, I wish you'd
stop coddling me.

301
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:33,934
I know you're sorry

302
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:35,310
and you didn't mean
to give me a heart attack.

303
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:37,116
Not a heart attack, Dad.

304
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:38,344
A cardiac event.

305
00:13:38,617 --> 00:13:41,520
You know, maybe we can
look on this as a sign

306
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,023
that you should begin
a healthier lifestyle.

307
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:46,025
Perhaps one day
we'll look back on this

308
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:47,390
it.
and you'll thank me for

309
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:48,918
NILES:
Oh, yes.

310
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:51,964
Maybe then you can find
a nice card for Frasier

311
00:13:51,964 --> 00:13:54,300
Iike, "Now that I'm old
and looking back,

312
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,961
I thank you for
my heart attack. "

313
00:13:56,268 --> 00:13:58,236
Cardiac event.

314
00:13:58,537 --> 00:14:00,105
.
Here. Give me
this, will you

315
00:14:00,105 --> 00:14:02,596
No, Dad, here,
I'll take this
in your room for you.

316
00:14:03,108 --> 00:14:05,099
Why don't you just
go sit down and rest.

317
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:07,513
Were you able to reach
Ronee at her mom's?
No.

318
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:08,502
Well, here,
you can try now.

320
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,517
What?

321
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:14,286
She doesn't need to know
every little thing

322
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:15,184
that goes on in my life.

323
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:17,088
Dad, you had
a heart attack.

324
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:19,959
Cardiac event.

325
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:21,994
And it's over.

326
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:24,087
- Dad...
- It's over.

327
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:26,465
Dad, are you afraid

328
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:27,454
she'll start seeing
you differently?

329
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:28,968
Well, you see
me differently.

330
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:30,458
"Let me have that
suitcase, Dad. "

331
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:32,471
"Just sit down and rest. "

332
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:35,463
I don't need her thinking
of me as some feeble old guy.

333
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:38,068
Do you really want to keep such
an enormous secret from her?

334
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,945
Well, not forever.

335
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:42,106
You and Niles can tell her
after I'm dead.

336
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:43,415
(doorbell ringing)

337
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:44,917
Oh, that'll be Daphne.

338
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:46,407
She's not
cooking, is she?

339
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:48,409
I just got out
of the hospital.

340
00:14:53,592 --> 00:14:55,025
Ronee.

341
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,161
Surprise, boys.

342
00:14:56,161 --> 00:14:58,664
?
.
And start pouring.
How you doing, sweetie

343
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:01,166
.
Hey. Thought you were at your mother's

344
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:02,668
Oh, you know,
I cut it short.

345
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:04,169
.
It was just too depressing

346
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:06,160
Every since her operation,
she just sits around all day

347
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:07,661
Iike she's a hundred.

348
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:11,243
Nice flowers.

349
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:12,945
"Get well soon"?

350
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:15,247
Oh, I got those for Frasier.

351
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:16,942
He has a little...

352
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:18,944
man problem.

353
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:24,547
Flares up every
once in a while.

354
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:27,982
(laughing):
Frasier has a man problem.

355
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:32,595
Shut up, you nit.

356
00:15:32,998 --> 00:15:35,367
Hey, thank God
for antibiotics, huh?

357
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:38,370
I'll be right back,
and then you want to go out

358
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:40,072
and get some ribs?

359
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:41,266
Ribs sounds great.

360
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:43,497
her.
Well, I'm not telling

361
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:46,068
You heard what she said about her mother.

362
00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:48,510
Watch me.

363
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:50,082
And how are you going
to explain the fact

364
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:51,383
that you can't eat ribs tonight

365
00:15:51,383 --> 00:15:52,281
or the new medication
that you're on

366
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:53,576
or the fact that you
can't have sex

367
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:55,020
?
.
for the next two weeks

368
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,385
.
Who says?
It's on the list

369
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:59,249
What little picture
is next to that one?

370
00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:04,985
Dad...

371
00:16:05,497 --> 00:16:10,502
Listen, if she's not able
to handle something like this,

372
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:12,993
isn't it better
if you know now?

373
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:18,405
Okay, Marty,
let's go pig out.

374
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:21,347
Niles, help me put this stuff away, will you?

375
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:23,042
Good seeing you again, Ronee.

376
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:25,078
Yeah, you, too, and I'm glad
you're feeling better.

377
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:26,146
Sorry?

378
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:27,249
.
You know, your man problem

379
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,188
!
.
Ha

380
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:32,055
FRASIER:
Keep laughing, you're going
to have a man problem.

382
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:37,188
Do you mind if we
just sit for awhile?

383
00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:38,597
No, no, it's fine.

384
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:40,189
You want me to go
get you a beer?

385
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:42,368
No, thanks.

386
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:44,359
So, uh...

387
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:47,368
did you have good weather
over there in Spokane?

388
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:50,075
Oh, God, it rained
the entire time.

389
00:16:50,075 --> 00:16:51,377
I basically just sat there

390
00:16:51,377 --> 00:16:54,079
and made boring small talk
with my mother.

391
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,070
God, I hate small talk.

392
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:58,077
Oh, tell me.

394
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:13,098
I just hope it doesn't scare her off.

395
00:17:13,098 --> 00:17:15,100
Maybe she'll surprise us.

396
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:18,092
Does Ronee ever spend
the night here?

397
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:20,039
Yeah, on occasion.

398
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,438
Oh, good. 'Cause there's
some underwear in this drawer

399
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:24,132
I was really hoping
didn't belong to Dad.

400
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:27,543
Oh, look at this.

401
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:33,552
fun.
Dad was right-- we're
camping and we're having

402
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:35,042
Look how happy we are.

403
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:41,048
No, the car's packed.
We're leaving.

404
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,562
God, what pains we were.

405
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:45,564
Didn't want to get
our hands dirty,

406
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:47,099
didn't want to go fishing,

407
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:49,068
didn't want to sleep
on the ground,

408
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,569
but he kept taking us...

409
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:54,061
year after year just
so he could spend time with us.

410
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,541
And frighten us to death

411
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:58,243
with stories
of hook-armed slashers.

412
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:00,546
You know, no matter
how frightened I got,

413
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:03,082
as soon as Dad started
laughing again,

414
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,073
I knew that everything was safe.

415
00:18:05,384 --> 00:18:08,751
I'm not ready
to lose him, Niles.

416
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:10,589
Me neither.

417
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:14,093
And I don't want my
child to miss knowing him.

418
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:18,393
Who else is going to teach him
how to catch a football ball?

419
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:28,574
You know, 1 1 years ago
when he moved in here,

420
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:31,276
I couldn't imagine
a bigger infringement

421
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:33,278
.
on my life

422
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:38,580
Now... I can't imagine
my life without him.

423
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:42,421
It would be very hard
to walk into this apartment

424
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:44,116
and see that chair...

425
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:48,226
and know that Dad
wasn't here anymore.

426
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:51,519
Oh, I'd get rid
of that chair immediately.

427
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:59,138
So you made it from Spokane
on one tank? Wow.

428
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:02,808
Yeah, that was really
one for the books.

429
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,810
Okay, Marty,
what's going on?

430
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,311
What?

431
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:08,336
Well, I feel like you have
something on your mind

432
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:09,644
me.
that you're not telling

434
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:19,458
Boy, this is hard.

435
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:22,327
say.
I'm just nervous about
what you're going to

436
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:23,328
Marty, just...

437
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:26,331
,
Yesterday I had a mild

438
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:29,334
very mild cardiac event.

439
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:30,801
A what?

440
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:38,608
I had a little heart attack.

441
00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:44,475
And that's it?

443
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:50,622
No surgery,
home the next day.

444
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:52,324
That's a bee sting.

445
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:54,189
.
Did they use the paddles?
No

446
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,759
.
Well, talk to me after
they've used the paddles

447
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,699
You had the paddles?

448
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:04,703
Let's just say I didn't have
the best lipo guy.

449
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:07,206
Well, I'm sorry if it'
s not dramatic enough for you.

450
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,708
Look, after all that buildup
I just thought it would be

451
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,198
something bigger, you know,

452
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,712
Iike you were going
to break up with me

453
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,202
or pop the question
or something.

454
00:20:15,681 --> 00:20:17,683
And FYI, the next time
you're in the hospital,

455
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:20,243
I would appreciate a phone call,
if it's not too much trouble.

456
00:20:20,485 --> 00:20:22,578
.
Fine. And FYI, I'm
not breaking up with you

457
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:23,977
Well, I know that now.

458
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:26,081
And if I was going to do
that other thing,

459
00:20:26,491 --> 00:20:27,492
it wouldn't be here.

460
00:20:27,492 --> 00:20:28,493
What other thing?

461
00:20:28,493 --> 00:20:29,494
Pop the question.

462
00:20:29,494 --> 00:20:30,996
Oh.

463
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:32,486
sake.
It'd be someplace
romantic, for God's

464
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:35,000
Tablecloths.

465
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,501
Nice.

466
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:38,492
nice.
Damn right
it'd be

467
00:20:40,505 --> 00:20:41,473
So?

468
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:42,474
So what?

469
00:20:42,474 --> 00:20:43,976
So what would
you have said ?

470
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:45,978
How should I know?
You didn't ask me.

471
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:47,412
So say I am now.

472
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:47,969
.
What?
Asking you

473
00:20:48,513 --> 00:20:49,514
Well, are you
or aren't you?

474
00:20:49,514 --> 00:20:50,515
am.
I

475
00:20:50,515 --> 00:20:51,516
Okay then.

476
00:20:51,516 --> 00:20:53,018
Okay.

477
00:20:53,018 --> 00:20:55,354
?
.
Okay, what

478
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:56,755
Okay, I will.

479
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:58,423
Yeah ?

480
00:20:58,423 --> 00:20:59,358
Yeah.

481
00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:00,425
Okay.

482
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:01,722
Okay.

483
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:08,867
Maybe Dad's right.

484
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:11,370
I'm getting
stuck in my ways.

485
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:14,862
I like the way things are.
I don't want them to change.

486
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:16,375
Well, don't worry.

487
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:18,377
He's not going
