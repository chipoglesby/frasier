1
00:00:09,743 --> 00:00:11,734
 Good morning  ..

2
00:00:12,078 --> 00:00:13,680
 Good morning

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,182
 I'd like a bagel, too .

4
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:17,751
 And schmear it with cream cheese

5
00:00:17,751 --> 00:00:18,752
Excuse me.

6
00:00:18,752 --> 00:00:19,753
 Thank you.

7
00:00:19,753 --> 00:00:21,254
Excuse me!

8
00:00:21,254 --> 00:00:22,756
Did it occur to you

9
00:00:22,756 --> 00:00:24,257
that some of us might
still be trying to sleep?

10
00:00:24,257 --> 00:00:25,246
Oh, lighten up, Fras.

11
00:00:25,759 --> 00:00:26,760
Ronee was just showing me

12
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:27,761
how she can change the lyrics

13
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:28,762
to any song to suit the occasion.

14
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:29,763
Yes, very impressive.

15
00:00:29,763 --> 00:00:31,131
Does she take requests?

16
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:31,529
Sure.

17
00:00:32,232 --> 00:00:34,234
Stop it.

18
00:00:34,234 --> 00:00:35,531
You know what you need, Grumpy?

19
00:00:36,236 --> 00:00:37,225
A nice hot breakfast.

20
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:39,239
Marty, why don't you get
Grump here some breakfast?

21
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:40,540
I don't want any breakfast.

22
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,542
And please stop calling me that.

23
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:45,545
?? Got me some ham and
some cake on the griddle??

24
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:49,249
?? whoo! Good God, he's a grumpy boy.??

25
00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:50,650
(laughing)

26
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:52,252
You see what she just did?

27
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:54,482
Yes, it's mind-boggling.

28
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:55,789
Listen, Dad, do you mind

29
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:57,724
giving me a ride to work today?

30
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:59,225
My car is in the shop.

31
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:00,226
Again?

32
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:02,228
Yes, my seat warmer's stuck on high.

33
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:05,732
So I tried to offset it by
blasting the air conditioner,

34
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:09,224
which resulted in sort of
a fog bank on my dashboard.

35
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:11,438
I can give you a ride, Fras.

36
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:13,406
It's just an old Caddy,

37
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:16,409
so there's nothing fancy like
butt warmers or seat belts.

38
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:21,181
Fine. Let me just make
sure my will is in order,

39
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:23,274
and I'll be back in a minute.

40
00:01:23,783 --> 00:01:25,151
well, I'm going to take a shower.

41
00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:27,287
Don't use all the hot water.

42
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:29,589
I know. Gotta leave
enough for milady's tub.

43
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:31,591
That's okay. I can take a shower, too.

44
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:33,582
I wasn't talking about you.

45
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:37,597
(phone rings)

46
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:40,333
Hello?

47
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:42,435
Oh, Richard, hi.

48
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:44,504
Listen, this really isn't a good time.

49
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:47,607
I was just heading into a yoga class.

50
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:50,477
Yeah. No. I would love to have dinner.

51
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:53,513
That sounds fun.

52
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:56,311
Okay, I'll see you then, sweetie.

53
00:01:58,318 --> 00:02:00,309
You know, I got two steps in my room

54
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:01,821
and realized I forgot my...

55
00:02:01,821 --> 00:02:03,323
Ah, there it is.

56
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:06,326
(to the tune of "There
She Is, Miss America ")

57
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:07,327
?? There it is??

58
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:10,194
?? Frasier's coffee cup...??

59
00:02:10,497 --> 00:02:13,261
You are a national treasure.

60
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:21,341
Niles, thank God you're here.

61
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:22,342
Listen, there's something
I need to discuss.

62
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:23,843
wait, wait, wait.

63
00:02:23,843 --> 00:02:25,345
I'm in the middle of composing a plea

64
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:26,846
to Alfred Antin in
the meter of Dr. Seuss.

65
00:02:26,846 --> 00:02:28,348
who?

66
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:30,250
Theodor Geisel, the children's author.

67
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,718
You know, "I do not
like green eggs and ham,

68
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:33,186
I do not like them, Sam I Am. "

69
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:35,188
Yes, I know who Dr. Seuss is, you ninny.

70
00:02:35,188 --> 00:02:36,177
who's the other guy?

71
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:37,690
Oh, oh. Alfred Antin.

72
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,180
He's Seattle's premier scenic painter

73
00:02:39,692 --> 00:02:40,693
specializing in children's rooms.

74
00:02:40,693 --> 00:02:42,195
His billowing clouds can be seen

75
00:02:42,195 --> 00:02:44,197
scudding across the ceilings

76
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:45,698
of the finest nurseries in town,

77
00:02:45,698 --> 00:02:47,200
but he's booked solid,

78
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,701
.. so I thought if I wrote this.

79
00:02:48,701 --> 00:02:51,538
Oh, you've lost interest , haven't you?

80
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:54,240
I was feigning interest to begin with.

81
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,543
Niles, I need your advice on something.

82
00:02:56,543 --> 00:03:01,548
This morning I heard Ronee on the phone

83
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:03,914
make a date with another man.

84
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:05,418
Are you sure?

85
00:03:05,418 --> 00:03:06,920
well, I'm positive

86
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,922
she was talking to a man,
yes, and in honeyed tones.

87
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:09,411
Mm.

88
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:11,658
Here's my predicament.

89
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:13,626
I don't want to meddle,

90
00:03:13,626 --> 00:03:16,329
but I also don't want
to see Dad get hurt.

91
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:18,320
So how do you suggest we tell him?

92
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:24,404
"we"? Yes, "we. "

93
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:26,806
Don't drag me into this. I
don't know a thing about it.

94
00:03:26,806 --> 00:03:27,795
You know as much as I
do. I just briefed you.

95
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,232
I didn't want to be briefed.

96
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:30,710
Then you should have said something.

97
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,212
Now you're in as deep as I am.

98
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:33,713
You can't unscramble an egg, Niles.

99
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,215
what are you talking about?!

100
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:38,218
Oh, boys, boys, boys.
I'm glad I caught you.

101
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:39,708
Did you see this?

102
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,523
"Doo-wop-alooza
"?

103
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:45,225
Yeah, one night only.

104
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,527
All the greats of doo-wop:
The Coasters, The platters,

105
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:49,222
and that guy from The Teenagers

106
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:51,231
is back from his hip replacement.

107
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,232
wow.

108
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,234
Yes.

109
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,236
Oh, I know you guys aren't
interested in modern music,

110
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,004
but Ronee would really love it.

111
00:03:58,004 --> 00:04:00,506
I was hoping maybe you
could use your connections

112
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:01,941
to maybe score us a couple of seats.

113
00:04:01,941 --> 00:04:03,431
I'm afraid I'm not

114
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:05,433
that well-connected to
the doo-wop world, Dad.

115
00:04:05,945 --> 00:04:08,948
If there's ever a Mahler
- palooza, I'm your man.

116
00:04:08,948 --> 00:04:11,451
Dad, I'll ask around.

117
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:14,454
win I'm off to try to

118
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:17,957
the heart and mind of A. Antin.

119
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:19,959
I'll go and meet him with my Daphne

120
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,450
and hope that things
don't go ker-phaphne.

121
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:29,969
Sorry again about this morning
me and Ronee waking you up.

122
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:31,960
we were just having a little fun.

123
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:33,973
It's all right. It's great t
have a fling once in a while.

124
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:35,964
Hey, let me tell you something:

125
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:38,778
you don't go to
Doo-wop-alooza with a fling.

126
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:40,268
I see.

127
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,284
You got something you want to say, son?

128
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,273
No.

129
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:46,286
Fine.

130
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,787
well, all right,

131
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:50,790
if you insist on dragging it out of me.

132
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,292
Something happened this morning, Dad.

133
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:52,792
what?

134
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,727
well, I was

135
00:04:54,727 --> 00:04:57,430
walking down the hall
to retrieve my coffee

136
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:58,727
and Ronee was on the phone,

137
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:01,734
and I didn't want to
interrupt so I waited.

138
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:04,437
And I heard her make a...

139
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:06,428
a date with another man.

140
00:05:10,743 --> 00:05:12,011
So you eavesdropped, huh?

141
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:13,613
No.

142
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:15,315
A person's having a
private conversation,

143
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,316
you stop and listen--
that's eavesdropping.

144
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,317
Dad, it was completely by accident.

145
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,319
I understand why you'd be upset,

146
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,321
but please don't shoot the messenger.

147
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,310
well, the messenger's got it coming

148
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:25,318
if he's a dirty little eavesdropper.

149
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,627
You walk into a private conversation,

150
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:30,330
you make your presence
known by some subtle way.

151
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,631
You can clear your
throat. (clears throat)

152
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:32,632
You can make a noise.

153
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:34,634
Dad, please!

154
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:36,336
You know, just because people call in

155
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,327
for your precious pearls
of wisdom on the radio,

156
00:05:38,638 --> 00:05:39,627
doesn't give you a free pass

157
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,341
to get into everybody's business.

158
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,643
Now I know why you 're always
saying, "I'm listening. "

159
00:05:43,643 --> 00:05:45,338
Because you always are.

160
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,342
(laughing)

161
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:53,353
Oh, well, I'm glad the two
of you found that so amusing,

162
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:54,654
but as you've just heard,

163
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:56,645
 it is rude to listen in
on other people's conversations.

164
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:15,166
(doorbell rings)

165
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:18,077
Oh, Niles, come on i n. Hey, Frasier.

166
00:06:18,077 --> 00:06:19,078
Hi. I'm just here to drop off

167
00:06:19,078 --> 00:06:20,580
these Doo-wop-alooza
tickets for Dad.

168
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:23,082
Oh, well, that's good
luck. How did you manage it?

169
00:06:23,082 --> 00:06:24,584
well, actually,

170
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:26,085
Alfred Antin and his
wife are big doo-wop fans,

171
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:27,587
and the, uh, the couple

172
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:29,077
that was going with them canceled,

173
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:30,590
so-so they let...

174
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,581
they let me have the tickets.

175
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:36,596
what are we looking for?

176
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:38,097
well, my money clip. Have you seen it?

177
00:06:38,097 --> 00:06:40,088
Rarely.

178
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:45,171
I've misplaced it,

179
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:46,672
and it's-it's distracting me no end.

180
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:47,639
well, anyway, Dad was thrilled

181
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:49,642
when I told him I found the tickets.

182
00:06:49,642 --> 00:06:51,177
Oh, well, I'm glad to hear that.

183
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:52,645
He was just a bit vexed

184
00:06:52,645 --> 00:06:53,634
when he left me earlier this morning.

185
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:55,148
Over what?

186
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:57,083
Frasier,

187
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,584
you told him about Ronee's date.

188
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:00,916
As we agreed.

189
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:01,816
"we"?

190
00:07:02,488 --> 00:07:03,489
Yes, "we. "

191
00:07:03,489 --> 00:07:04,786
" . There's no "we. "
There's never been a "we

192
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:06,192
Oh, give it up, Niles.

193
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:08,694
There's blood on both our hands.

194
00:07:08,694 --> 00:07:10,685
Oh, gosh, I better go eat something.

195
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:13,199
I've got my reading in 20 minutes.

196
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,700
Reading? Yes.

197
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,702
Yes. I'm, uh, reciting "Annabelle Lee"

198
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:18,192
for the poe Society this evening.

199
00:07:18,704 --> 00:07:21,207
I-I don't mind telling you
, I'm just a bit nervous.

200
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:22,174
Oh, don't worry.

201
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:24,644
po' folk don't'spect much.

202
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:26,635
(laughing)

203
00:07:27,146 --> 00:07:29,148
I had to say that.

204
00:07:29,148 --> 00:07:30,650
well, I'm off.

205
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,641
Yes.

206
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:36,144
(door opening)

207
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:38,146
(door closing)

208
00:07:44,163 --> 00:07:46,028
It's this amazing doo-wop show.

209
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:48,901
All the greats, one
night only, this Sunday.

210
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:50,892
RONEE: Sunday? I...

211
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:55,597
God, I'm sorry. I-I... I made plans.

212
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:56,843
Oh, plans, huh?

213
00:07:56,843 --> 00:07:59,846
Uh... what kind of plans?

214
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:02,548
Look, Marty, I like you
too much to lie to you. I...

215
00:08:02,548 --> 00:08:03,850
I have a date.

216
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:05,218
Oh, oh.

217
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:07,553
well, that's no problem. Yeah.

218
00:08:07,553 --> 00:08:09,555
Uh, you want a drink?

219
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:12,683
Oh, no, I better not.
I'm working. Just a beer.

220
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:18,698
You're not upset, are you?

221
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:20,700
I mean, you know, we never really talked

222
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,702
about not seeing other people.

223
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:24,003
Oh, no, that's fine. No, no.

224
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,705
I'm seeing other people, too.

225
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:27,707
Maybe I'll ask, uh...

226
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:28,708
Sheila.

227
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,710
Yeah. She'll be all over this one.

228
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,945
(Ronee laughs)

229
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:35,047
So, uh...

230
00:08:35,047 --> 00:08:37,650
how about another night?

231
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,550
Yeah, sure. How's... what about Tuesday?

232
00:08:39,785 --> 00:08:40,753
Great. Great.

233
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:42,255
Great. Great.

234
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:44,624
RONEE: wow, I had no
idea it was this late.

235
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:46,125
So I'll call you about Tuesday.

236
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,114
Great.

237
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:50,027
(sighs)

238
00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:58,294
Frasier, what are you doing?

239
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:05,745
I didn't know you two were home.

240
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:07,246
Uh...

241
00:09:07,246 --> 00:09:09,081
I was just, uh, cleaning the oven.

242
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:12,685
I must have dozed off.

243
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:14,086
Cool.

244
00:09:14,086 --> 00:09:16,589
well, got to run. Good night, you two.

245
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:17,578
Yeah. See ya.

246
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,593
You have a disease!

247
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:22,083
please.

248
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:23,596
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

249
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:24,630
Let me explain, all right?

250
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:25,619
There's nothing to explain.

251
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:27,588
I told you not to eavesdrop,
and you did it again.

252
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,303
You are a very sick person.

253
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:32,638
I tried to announce myself,

254
00:09:32,638 --> 00:09:33,696
but I had a mouth full of apple,

255
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:35,675
rendering me speechless.

256
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:38,940
Oh. I was a cop. You think I
haven't heard that one before?

257
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:41,769
You're just angry

258
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:43,282
because I heard you lying to Ronee.

259
00:09:43,282 --> 00:09:45,284
You really expect to win Ronee's heart

260
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:46,786
by inventing fictitious girlfriends?

261
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:48,287
Sheila indeed.

262
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:50,790
well, that's none of your business,

263
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:51,991
and you weren't supposed to hear it.

264
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:53,025
well, I did hear it.

265
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:54,927
No, you overheard it.

266
00:09:54,927 --> 00:10:00,032
It's like an illegal
wiretap. It's inadmissible.

267
00:10:00,032 --> 00:10:02,134
. Dad, you cannot build
a relationship on lies

268
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:03,636
Inadmissible. Dad...

269
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:04,625
Inadmissible!

270
00:10:05,137 --> 00:10:06,138
Oh, fine.

271
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:07,373
(door slams)

272
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:08,362
(door slams)

273
00:10:21,654 --> 00:10:22,655
why can't your father

274
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:25,157
just go to the concert by himself?

275
00:10:25,157 --> 00:10:26,692
Because Alfred Antin will be offended

276
00:10:26,692 --> 00:10:27,994
if we don't us e his tickets

277
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:29,028
and then he won't paint our nursery.

278
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:30,393
Don't you want to be
the one to go with him?

279
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:32,098
Forget it, Niles.

280
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:33,793
we flipped a coin and you
were the doo-wop-a-loser.

281
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:38,104
Hey, Niles.

282
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:40,806
Ready to
bop-bop- she-bop?

283
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:42,808
Oh, dear God. Is it a dance?

284
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:44,110
Am I going to have to move about?

285
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:47,113
 No, you don't have to,
but you're going to want to

286
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:48,080
Daphne?

287
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,782
I'm pregnant.

288
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:51,083
what does that have to do with it?

289
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:53,753
It's my blanket excuse
until the baby is born.

290
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:55,755
After that it'll be, "I
can't leave the baby. "

291
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:56,744
Get used to it.

292
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,061
Oh, Marty, hi.

293
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:04,063
Ronee, hey.

294
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:06,065
Oh, this is Richard.

295
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:08,768
Martin, Daphne, Niles.

296
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:10,069
Hello, Richard. Hi.

297
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:11,771
Hello.

298
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:13,773
So how do you all know each other?

299
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:16,075
well, uh...

300
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:17,133
Ronee was my baby-sitter.

301
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:22,110
I was a little monster.

302
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:25,117
And you?

303
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:26,819
Um...

304
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:29,117
Sheila! where have you been?

305
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:39,131
This is my date, Sheila.

306
00:11:39,131 --> 00:11:40,833
Got stuck at work, huh?

307
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:41,834
Uh, yeah?

308
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:43,135
Yeah.

309
00:11:43,135 --> 00:11:44,124
Sheila's a model.

310
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:48,136
She does all those
big auto and R V shows.

311
00:11:50,142 --> 00:11:53,134
point to something.

312
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:00,152
wow, impressive. Nice meeting you.

313
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:02,154
Let's get ours to go.

314
00:12:02,154 --> 00:12:03,856
But I thought...

315
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:05,847
Roll with the punches, Dick.

316
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:10,863
what are you doing?

317
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:11,852
I'm trying to make her jealous.

318
00:12:12,164 --> 00:12:13,165
Just go with it.

319
00:12:13,165 --> 00:12:14,900
But I'm meeting my own date here.

320
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:15,889
Dad, the concert starts in 1 5 minutes,

321
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:17,863
and Alfred Antin will be
very angry if we're late.

322
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:20,172
well, I can't leave unless
Sheila comes with me.

323
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:23,175
Hello? Sheila has a date.

324
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:26,872
Here are the tickets.
You and I are going.

325
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:28,168
Oh, do we have to?

326
00:12:28,881 --> 00:12:29,882
Yes.

327
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:31,747
Do we really need clouds on the ceiling?

328
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:35,354
Couldn't we just push the
crib closer to the window?

329
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:36,856
why even use a crib?

330
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:39,347
Let's just put it in a pizza box.

331
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:42,383
(laughing loudly)

332
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:45,353
Stop it.

333
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:47,867
 Oh, you! work with me here.

334
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:49,357
Okay, okay.

335
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:55,841
Roz?

336
00:12:55,841 --> 00:12:57,843
Larry. Hi.

337
00:12:57,843 --> 00:13:00,334
This is my dad.

338
00:13:00,846 --> 00:13:01,347
How you doing?

339
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:02,336
Hello.

340
00:13:02,848 --> 00:13:04,338
You brought your dad on our date?

341
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:05,851
Oh, of course not.

342
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:07,853
He was just leaving. Aren't you, Dad?

343
00:13:07,853 --> 00:13:09,355
Yeah, but not until I finish my coffee.

344
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:10,356
You don't have any coffee.

345
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:11,857
Get me one, would you, Larry?

346
00:13:11,857 --> 00:13:13,359
Dad, what are you doing here?

347
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:14,348
Hi, Roz. Hello.

348
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:15,349
Hi.

349
00:13:15,861 --> 00:13:18,352
Is your brother joining us, too?

350
00:13:18,864 --> 00:13:20,366
He's not my brother.

351
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:22,357
Oh, now, that' s no way to be.

352
00:13:22,868 --> 00:13:25,359
Still waiting on that coffee, Lar.

353
00:13:26,872 --> 00:13:28,374
Okay, what the hell is going on?

354
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:29,375
Nothing.

355
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:30,376
Hi, Frasier.

356
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:31,877
Hi, Ronee.

357
00:13:31,877 --> 00:13:32,878
Nice to see you, Marty.

358
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:33,879
Sheila.

359
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:35,847
Take care. Bye.

360
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:42,855
So you've been pressed
into service as Sheila, hmm?

361
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:45,847
pressed is right. He
nearly bit my lip off.

362
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:48,360
Here you go, Mr. Doyle.

363
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,349
Ah, thanks.

364
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:50,863
Come on, Larry. we 're leaving.

365
00:13:50,863 --> 00:13:52,865
It's nice meeting you, Mr. Doyle.

366
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:54,366
And you can owe me on that coffee.

367
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:58,370
It was $3. 75 and I flipped
a quarter in the tip jar.

368
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:00,361
I'll be home early, Dad.

369
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:06,378
Dad, when are you going
to stop playing games

370
00:14:06,378 --> 00:14:07,379
and tell her how you feel?

371
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:08,881
It's too soon.

372
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:10,382
we've only been seeing
each other a few weeks.

373
00:14:10,382 --> 00:14:11,884
I don't want to scare her off.

374
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:13,875
How do you know you 're
going to scare her off?

375
00:14:14,386 --> 00:14:15,888
well, look at her, Fras.

376
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:18,390
She's young. She's got
all these guys after her.

377
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:20,893
I'm lucky she even
gave me a second glance.

378
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:22,895
I don't want to blow i t by looking

379
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:25,397
Like some desperate
old guy with no options.

380
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:26,386
It's not desperate

381
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:28,389
to tell somebody how
you feel about them.

382
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:30,402
what if she doesn't feel the same way?

383
00:14:30,402 --> 00:14:33,098
what if she does and you never find out?

384
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:35,000
Dad...

385
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:37,009
just give her a call

386
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:39,637
and tell her you want to talk to her.

387
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,949
(grunts)

388
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:46,252
was that a "leave me alone" grunt,

389
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:48,621
or a "you've bested me again, son,

390
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:51,021
with your unassailable logic" grunt?

391
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:54,226
(grunts)

392
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:55,921
I thought so.

393
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:00,666
Hey, Dad.

394
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:01,934
what you watching?

395
00:15:01,934 --> 00:15:03,035
Sports wrap-up.

396
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:04,236
Sports wrap-up.

397
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:07,239
That sounds like fun. Oof. (chuckles)

398
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:10,606
Oh, gosh, that's not very sportsmanlike.

399
00:15:10,976 --> 00:15:12,444
I called her, okay.

400
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:14,113
Not that it's any of your business.

401
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:16,115
So...?

402
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:17,616
I left a message.

403
00:15:17,616 --> 00:15:19,118
I'm glad she wasn't there.

404
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:20,386
I don't know what I'll
say if she calls back.

405
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:21,683
well, you did the right thing, Dad.

406
00:15:22,187 --> 00:15:23,188
I am proud of you.

407
00:15:23,188 --> 00:15:24,690
I don't know.

408
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:26,191
The whole thing's making me nervous.

409
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:28,227
You know, I know why
she's not calling me back.

410
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:29,695
e She doesn't know how to tell m

411
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:31,424
she's dropping me for
Richard. (doorbell rings)

412
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:35,968
well, who said anything
about dropping you?

413
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:39,131
. No one, apparently, or
you would've overheard it

414
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:44,610
Oh, hi, Ronee.

415
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,578
Hi, Frasier.

416
00:15:46,578 --> 00:15:48,068
Ronee, I didn't expect
to see you tonight.

417
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,582
well, I got your message and
I was in the neighborhood.

418
00:15:50,582 --> 00:15:52,072
So, what's up?

419
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:56,588
Oh, uh...

420
00:15:56,588 --> 00:15:58,090
I was just heading out.

421
00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:59,591
what, at this hour?

422
00:15:59,591 --> 00:16:01,026
I never thought you
were such a night owl.

423
00:16:01,026 --> 00:16:02,261
Oh, yeah.

424
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:04,252
Yeah, I love clubbin '.

425
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,268
I-I thought you'd just call.

426
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:11,971
well, you know, I was going
to, but it sounded like

427
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,272
maybe we needed to
talk face-to-face.

428
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:15,975
Yeah.

429
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,966
Marty, is this about that woman

430
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:19,979
I saw you with tonight?

431
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,281
well... kind of.

432
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:24,283
Yeah, I thought so.

433
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:25,985
Look, whatever it is,

434
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,987
why don't you just come out and say it.

435
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,989
Yeah, all right.

436
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:34,289
.. well, um... I'm not
the kind of guy who.

437
00:16:36,695 --> 00:16:38,664
Hey, you want a beer?

438
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,199
Oh, boy, do I need one?

439
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:41,700
No, I think we could both use one.

440
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:42,201
(doorbell rings)

441
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:43,702
would you get that?

442
00:16:43,702 --> 00:16:45,204
Frasier probably forgot his key.

443
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:46,193
Yeah, sure.

444
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:54,179
Oh, Sheila.

445
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:56,443
I kind of thought your date was over.

446
00:16:56,615 --> 00:17:00,686
well... maybe it is...

447
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:03,177
and maybe it isn't.

448
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:08,694
Gotcha.

449
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:11,697
Uh, just tell Marty, message received.

450
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:14,188
Okay.

451
00:17:15,901 --> 00:17:17,403
Hey, Roz, what are you doing here?

452
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:18,392
I found Frasier's
money clip . Is he home?

453
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:19,772
No, uh-uh.

454
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:21,273
where's Ronee?

455
00:17:21,273 --> 00:17:22,775
Oh, don't worry.

456
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:26,779
Sheila showed Ronee the door.

457
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:28,280
what?!

458
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,783
what the hell did you do that for?!

459
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:33,274
Hey, I have no control
over what Sheila does.

460
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:39,258
Oh, good, Niles, you're
back . How was the concert?

461
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:40,555
well, you're the one who
wanted that cloud mural.

462
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,251
I'm sure pope Julius had to
jump through similar hoops

463
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:44,551
to get Michelangelo
to paint his ceiling.

464
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:46,265
Dear God, I think I just realized

465
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:48,200
where I must've dropped my money clip.

466
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,202
Ronee's car.

467
00:17:50,202 --> 00:17:52,504
She gave me a ride in
it the day I lost it.

468
00:17:52,504 --> 00:17:55,107
well, that's irresponsible of her.

469
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:56,141
She just left it open.

470
00:17:56,141 --> 00:17:57,142
Excuse me.

471
00:17:57,142 --> 00:17:59,133
Oh, yes, of course.

472
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:00,434
There we are.

473
00:18:01,146 --> 00:18:02,448
Thank you.

474
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:04,450
Anyway, I thought I'd swing by

475
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:06,441
and take us both out for a
nightcap. (engine starting)

476
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:07,813
All right, great.

477
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,289
By the way, Niles, I,
uh, I spoke with Dad

478
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:14,593
and he has taken our advice
about talking things over..

479
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:17,596
Mine and yours, that's
what I mean by "our. "

480
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:22,301
Oh, take some responsibility
for once in your life, man.

481
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:24,599
You could've at least warned m
that Sheila was on her way up.

482
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:26,605
Ronee, it's all a misunderstanding.

483
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,307
Marty, I really don't want to hear it.

484
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:30,309
well, you're going to hear
it 'cause I'm not leaving.

485
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:32,607
Fine, just get in the
car if you want to.

486
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:36,615
we're going to sit right
here until you hear it all.

487
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:39,284
Okay, go ahead.

488
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:40,786
But you better make it good

489
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,788
because I have a finely
tuned crap-ometer.

490
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,790
There is no Sheila. Her name's Roz.

491
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,280
She's Frasier's secretary.

492
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,794
I just pretended we were together.

493
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,195
Forget it, Marty.

494
00:18:50,195 --> 00:18:52,331
I know how this sounds, but it's true.

495
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:54,166
why would you do that?

496
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:57,536
Because I'd gotten these
concert tickets to impress you.

497
00:18:57,536 --> 00:19:00,539
And then when you said
you had a date, I got...

498
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:04,243
well, I got jealous, so I
said I was getting a date, too.

499
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:06,545
And then there you were in Nervosa,

500
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:09,241
and when Roz came in, I made her Sheila.

501
00:19:11,183 --> 00:19:13,344
Do you believe me?

502
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:18,857
. You know, it's actually a little hot

503
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:19,846
Really?

504
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:29,835
Look, Ronee, uh, maybe
I'm old-fashioned,

505
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:32,337
but I know when something feels right.

506
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:34,339
I don't want to see anybody else.

507
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:36,842
I want to be exclusive.

508
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,833
Go steady, whatever they call it now.

509
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:44,838
well, that's my story.

510
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,852
what about you?

511
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,843
(sighs) : well...

512
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:50,844
. God, it's freezing in here

513
00:19:51,223 --> 00:19:52,713
I had a blanket.

514
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:02,434
Okay.

515
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:05,871
Since we're being honest, uh,

516
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:08,874
well, I-I've done my share of dating,

517
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:11,866
and I haven't always
made the best choices.

518
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:16,381
I've dated the bad guys,
the guys who can't commit,

519
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:17,883
, the guys who won't grow up

520
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:20,875
the creeps with the nice
suit, the pathological liars...

521
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:23,388
Okay, I got it.

522
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:28,360
Anyway, and then I started
dating this really good guy--

523
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,657
you...

524
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:33,365
... and I guess I-I just wanted

525
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:35,367
to keep my options open with Richard

526
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:37,358
because I wasn't sure
how you felt about me.

527
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:42,367
But now I am.

528
00:20:56,655 --> 00:20:58,357
Now would be the time.

529
00:20:58,357 --> 00:21:01,660
to put your class ring
on a chain around my neck.

530
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,362
I got one upstairs.

531
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:05,353
You want to come get it?

532
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:13,605
wait, wait.

533
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:16,275
. I've got a better idea

534
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:19,611
I know this secluded beach
that's miles away from anything.

535
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:22,102
You want to go there
and steam up the windows?

536
00:21:22,547 --> 00:21:31,455
Oh, yeah.
