1
00:00:09,409 --> 00:00:13,113
And one of those cinnamon buns
please, extra frosting.

2
00:00:13,113 --> 00:00:15,104
Oh, here they are. Hey.

3
00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:17,117
Hi, you guys.

4
00:00:17,117 --> 00:00:19,108
We were so excited when
you guys asked us out.

5
00:00:19,419 --> 00:00:22,122
You're like the A-list couple
in Lamaze class.

6
00:00:22,122 --> 00:00:23,123
Well, that's good
to hear.

7
00:00:23,123 --> 00:00:25,125
We were afraid we
were in the C-Section.

8
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:26,683
(chuckling)

9
00:00:27,093 --> 00:00:29,195
We bring our own food
everywhere.

10
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:32,187
Sandy doesn't put anything
unhealthy in her body.

11
00:00:32,499 --> 00:00:34,490
No refined sugar,
white flour, or gluten.

12
00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:36,136
I'm sure you're the same.

13
00:00:36,136 --> 00:00:37,433
Oh, of course.

14
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:39,139
Cinnamon bun.

15
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:40,436
No, thank you.
I'm pregnant.

16
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:43,709
- But you...
- I said no.

17
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:47,213
Sweetie, this is your
best yam loaf yet.

18
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:49,516
He's a saint.
He cooks my food,

19
00:00:49,516 --> 00:00:51,217
rubs cocoa butter
on my belly...

20
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:52,519
I just wish I could

21
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:54,214
go through
the birth for her.

22
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:58,525
Hey, what are you guys
doing with your placenta?

23
00:00:58,525 --> 00:01:00,527
Ours will nourish
the roots

24
00:01:00,527 --> 00:01:02,222
of a special tree
we plant in our yard.

25
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,533
Well, we live in
an apartment.

26
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:08,535
Although that ficusin the study

27
00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:10,236
is looking a tad droopy.

28
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:12,238
By the way,

29
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:13,227
if you need a doula...

30
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,542
Cindy, I'm sure they
already have one.

31
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:16,543
Everybody has a doula.

32
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:19,245
BRAD:
Ours is a treasure.

33
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:22,248
She'll be there through the
whole delivery, you know,

34
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:24,546
focusing our energies,
giving us emotional support.

35
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:27,253
I don't know how people
do it without one.

36
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:28,555
She's really helped Brad.

37
00:01:28,555 --> 00:01:31,257
He's having a really
tough sympathy pregnancy.

38
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:32,559
Oh, boy.

39
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:33,560
Honey?

40
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,561
I'm just...

41
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:37,263
I'm feeling a little sick again
I'm sorry.

42
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:38,252
I just
need some air.

43
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:42,268
We're so in sync.

44
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:44,270
He feels everything
I'm feeling.

45
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,272
Nausea, weight gain,
food cravings.

46
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:48,274
You know,
in psychological terms,

47
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:49,434
that's called
Couvade Syndrome.

48
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:51,835
We just call it love.

49
00:01:55,348 --> 00:01:58,618
I don't like them.

50
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:01,688
They're getting so much more
out of this than we are.

51
00:02:01,688 --> 00:02:03,178
We don't even
have a placenta plan.

52
00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:06,693
No, wait--
let's not panic.

53
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:08,194
All we need
is expert help.

54
00:02:08,194 --> 00:02:10,196
We'll hire one of
those doula people.

55
00:02:10,196 --> 00:02:11,698
I'll get the number from Brad.

56
00:02:11,698 --> 00:02:13,700
Sorry. Sorry.

57
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:17,192
Oh, this pregnancy
is taking it

58
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:19,272
out of me.

59
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:22,842
My breasts
are so tender today.

60
00:02:22,842 --> 00:02:24,344
You know what?

61
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:26,778
I'm starting
to feel a bit nauseous.

62
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:45,720
(rattling)

63
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:46,721
Oh.

64
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:47,722
WOMAN:
Hi.

66
00:02:50,236 --> 00:02:51,738
A Matchmaking Service.
Come in.

67
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:53,239
I'm sorry...
Isn't this...?

68
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:54,741
Oh, I see what happened.

69
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:55,730
I must have been so
engrossed in my paper

70
00:02:56,242 --> 00:02:57,243
I went
right past my floor.

71
00:02:57,243 --> 00:02:58,745
Of course.

72
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:00,235
It can be a little
embarrassing to admit

73
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:02,248
you need help
in the romance department.

74
00:03:02,248 --> 00:03:03,416
Please, come in.

75
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:05,485
No, this was
a mistake.

76
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:06,486
I understand.

77
00:03:06,486 --> 00:03:09,182
Come in.

78
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:11,491
Trust me, you are
comically incorrect.

79
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:13,186
I do not need a matchmaker.

80
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:14,894
So you're married?

81
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:15,895
No.

82
00:03:15,895 --> 00:03:16,896
Dating someone?

83
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:18,398
I date plenty.

84
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:20,900
In fact, I often need
the proverbial stick

85
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,390
one uses to beat
women off with.

86
00:03:22,902 --> 00:03:24,392
I...

87
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:29,398
I believe my point is made.

88
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:30,777
Why don't you
just take my card?

89
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:31,778
I don't
need your card.

90
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:32,779
In case you
change your mind.

91
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:33,768
I won't
change my mind.

92
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:34,769
For a friend.
I have no friends.

93
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:38,341
... who are in need
of your services.

94
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:40,477
You see, I am a bit
of a local celebrity,

95
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:42,978
so I have no trouble
getting dates.

96
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:44,357
Really?
Yes.

97
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:45,625
What's your name?

98
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,327
Dr. Frasier Crane.

99
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:48,695
Oh.

100
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:51,596
Sorry, doesn't ring any bells.

101
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:54,467
Frasier Crane?

102
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:55,468
Why, yes it is.

103
00:03:55,468 --> 00:03:57,971
Well, my God, what are
you doing here?

104
00:03:57,971 --> 00:04:00,473
Well, actually, I have
an office one floor down.

105
00:04:00,473 --> 00:04:02,976
Really?
I'm on 1 8.

106
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:05,478
Oh, well why don't
I ride up with you,

107
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:06,479
I could use
the exercise.

108
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:08,470
Bye, bye.

109
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:10,850
It's so funny
seeing you here.

110
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:13,853
It's funny for you
, delightful for me.

111
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:15,355
It's always nice to meet a fan,

112
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:16,344
especially one
so attractive.

113
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:20,348
You don't remember me?

114
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,862
Yes, of course
I remember you.

115
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:25,365
It's you.

116
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:26,366
Hey, you.

117
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:29,869
I can't believe
you don't remember.

118
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:31,371
We dated.

119
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:32,872
Three times.

120
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:33,873
Jennifer.

121
00:04:33,873 --> 00:04:35,875
Ellie.
Ellie!

122
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:36,864
Oh, well,
here's your floor.

123
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:38,378
Nice catching
up with you.

124
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:40,369
Oh, brushing me off.
That sounds familiar.

125
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:44,917
Oh, not that I'm
surprised you forgot me.

126
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:47,920
You spent every day
talking about yourself,

127
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,390
and then, after
we slept together...

128
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:50,981
I'm so sorry.
Sorry.

129
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:52,492
But you could've
called me!

130
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:53,982
Sorry!
Again, so sorry.

131
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:11,611
FRASIER:
And so it seems

132
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:15,014
I have dated every
woman in Seattle.

133
00:05:15,014 --> 00:05:17,505
The well is dry.

134
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:20,019
The cupboard is bare.

135
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:23,420
There are no more
fish in the sea.

136
00:05:25,558 --> 00:05:27,327
Meanwhile, my dad is engaged.

137
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,329
My brother is expecting
his first child.

138
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,331
While I am left
to spin aimlessly

139
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,561
on the dating hamster wheel.

140
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:39,772
You like your metaphors,
don't you?

141
00:05:39,772 --> 00:05:42,408
Well, don't
worry, Frasier.

142
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:44,977
Somewhere in Seattle there's
a woman you haven't pissed off

143
00:05:44,977 --> 00:05:46,379
and I'm going to find her.

144
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:48,870
am.
You seem awfully
sure of yourself.I

145
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:50,504
I've successfully matched

146
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:51,951
hundreds of couples,

147
00:05:51,951 --> 00:05:53,953
so...

148
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:58,958
What kind of woman
are you looking for?

149
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:01,828
And don't just say smart, sexyand sophisticated.

150
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:03,429
Why, don't you
have any of those?

151
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:05,431
All right.

152
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:07,500
Well, it's
hard to say...

153
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,503
what I want.

154
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:13,639
It's been so long since I've
really fallen for someone.

155
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:16,109
You know that
feeling you get

156
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:17,974
after a first date,
when you can't even sleep,

157
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,079
you just lie
there in bed awake,

158
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:23,516
thinking about her?

159
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:26,386
That's what I want.

160
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,786
You're going to make me work
for my money, aren't you?

161
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,754
Uh, by the way,

162
00:06:31,457 --> 00:06:32,692
I do require
a payment up-front.

163
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:34,093
Oh, of course.

164
00:06:34,093 --> 00:06:36,027
My fee is $1 0, 000.

165
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:41,434
That's awfully steep.

166
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:43,436
And those ten years
of bad dates,

167
00:06:43,436 --> 00:06:45,171
how much did they run you?

168
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:47,002
I'll write you a check.

169
00:06:50,476 --> 00:06:51,544
So I gave her the money

170
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:52,845
and I filled out
the questionnaire.

171
00:06:52,845 --> 00:06:54,540
Mm.

172
00:06:54,847 --> 00:06:56,549
You fudged a little bit
on your answers, right?

173
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:57,846
No, of course not.
Why would I?

174
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,720
Because nobody's
honest on those things.

175
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,455
There's a code people use.

176
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:05,491
Like "mature"
means old.

177
00:07:05,491 --> 00:07:08,561
"Athletic" means
flat-chested.

178
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:10,062
And, uh, oh...

179
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:13,065
"not model thin"
means circus fat.

180
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:14,567
Well, gosh.

181
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:17,570
She's already sent me out
on a date this evening.

182
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:19,505
But I assure you,
I am more interested

183
00:07:19,505 --> 00:07:21,598
in personality than looks.

184
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:22,909
Did you see
a photo at least?

185
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:23,898
Of course
I saw a photo.

186
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,601
She's got a personality you
can bounce a quarter off of.

187
00:07:28,514 --> 00:07:30,049
So where you taking her?

188
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:30,981
Claret--
I intend to take

189
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:32,485
all subsequent dates
there as well.

190
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:34,487
That way I can compare
them objectively, you see.

191
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:35,977
As the woman will
be the only variable.

192
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:37,490
It's basic science.

193
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:38,591
Yeah.

194
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:40,183
That's been
your dating problem--

195
00:07:40,693 --> 00:07:41,557
not enough science.

196
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:44,497
Hey, you two.

197
00:07:44,497 --> 00:07:46,988
Here, have a seat.
There you are.

198
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,002
We can only chat for a moment.
We're meeting our doula.

199
00:07:50,002 --> 00:07:51,003
Oh, yes.

200
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:51,992
Your doula.

201
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:53,706
Anybody need
anything?

202
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:54,774
I'm getting more coffee.

203
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:56,075
DAPHNE:
No, thanks.

204
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:57,176
We brought fennel tea

205
00:07:57,176 --> 00:07:59,679
and some healthy
snacks to nibble on.

206
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:02,181
Oh, huh. Peanut butter and carrots.

207
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:04,183
Looks like somebody
has some pregnancy cravings.

208
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:05,172
Yes, I just
can't help myself.

209
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,623
Oh, dear, Niles.
Couvade Syndrome?

210
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:12,682
We just call it love.

211
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:15,695
Yes, well...
I have a date.

212
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:18,698
I've signed up with
a matchmaking service.

213
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:19,699
Wait, Frasier,
a matchmaker?

214
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:21,701
I'm surprised you'
d use a professional

215
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:23,168
for something as personal
as your love life.

216
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:25,171
Well, I could say
the same thing

217
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,672
about you and your doula.

218
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:28,174
Well, our professional
comes highly recommended.

219
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,176
So does my professional.

220
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,677
Well, our professional is
at the top of her field.

221
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:32,666
As is mine.

222
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,669
Well, our professional
charges $200 an hour.

223
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,170
Mine charges $ 1 0, 000.

224
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:42,688
She sounds fantastic.

225
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:44,690
Congratulations,
Frasier.

226
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:45,679
Thank you, Niles.
Wish me luck!

227
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,682
Good luck. Wow.

228
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:49,684
Daphne and Niles?

229
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,198
Oh, you must
be Harvest.

230
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,700
So nice to meet you.

231
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,190
Oh, this
is our friend Roz.

232
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:57,703
Hi.

233
00:08:57,703 --> 00:09:00,206
A resume detailing my
1 5 years of experience,

234
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:02,708
plus a syllabus
for further reading.

235
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:06,279
Well, I am doula impressed.

236
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:07,847
HARVEST:
Now, on page five,

237
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:10,543
you'll find details
about my support staff.

238
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,552
There's a masseuse,
a shaman, of course,

239
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:13,853
and a drummer.

240
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:15,844
He used to tour with
the Doobie Brothers.

241
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,558
Very talented.

242
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,560
My, sounds expensive.

243
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,551
I can't wait to tell Frasier.

244
00:09:22,862 --> 00:09:23,863
And of course, I insist on

245
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:25,231
a drug-free birthing environment.

246
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:28,100
Whoa. Back up. No drugs?

247
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,590
Oh, I want Daphne
to be awake

248
00:09:30,102 --> 00:09:31,604
and connected
to the moment.

249
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:33,873
A natural childbirth
needn't be painful.

250
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:37,206
It needn't be,
but it be.

251
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:40,201
How painful?

252
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:42,214
Would you have a tooth
pulled without Novocain?

253
00:09:42,214 --> 00:09:43,716
No.

254
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:47,208
Well, a tooth
is this big.

255
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,721
Oh, I'm sorry.

256
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:50,723
I thought you wanted
to be emotionally present

257
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:52,625
for the birth
of your baby,

258
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,024
but I see that
you just want

259
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:55,716
somebody
to dope you up,

260
00:09:56,028 --> 00:09:58,030
strap you down
and yank it out.

261
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,019
Oh, no, no. Wait. Don't go.

262
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:00,666
Yes, our friend

263
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:01,767
was just leaving.

264
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:02,735
All right.

265
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:04,303
You're right. I'm sorry.

266
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:06,305
This is a private matter.

267
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:08,296
You need to do
what's right for you.

268
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:09,199
Ow!

269
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:10,698
Times a million.

270
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:20,843
FRASIER:
Here we are.

271
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,254
WOMAN:
Thank you.

272
00:10:22,254 --> 00:10:23,623
There's something
wonderful

273
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,124
about first dates,
isn't there?

274
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,626
Oh, thank you
very much.

275
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:30,129
That tingle of anticipation
as two perfect strangers

276
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:33,121
march toward endless vistas
of possibility.

277
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:34,634
Well put, Frasier.

278
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,135
Oh, well
thank you.

279
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,637
And what do you do?

280
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,639
I'm a science teacher.

281
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:40,628
Ah, serendipity.

282
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,675
I'm a science man myself.

283
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:44,973
I suppose that's why Charlotte
got the two of us together.

284
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:46,667
Well then, what's your field?

285
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:48,681
Well, my field is biology,

286
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:50,683
but my specialty
is creationism.

287
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:52,685
Oh, well, I find that...

288
00:10:52,685 --> 00:10:54,320
Excuse me?

289
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,821
You know,
they're only in first grade,

290
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:57,323
so they don't understand
everything,

291
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,191
but Brother William,
he's our leader,

292
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:01,819
he likes us
to get them

293
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:04,163
started young before they
get their minds warped

294
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,665
by all that fossil nonsense.

295
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,656
Well, you know,
I-I realize that Darwin

296
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,658
has his detractors, but to call
it nonsense seems a bit

297
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,672
cavalier,
don't you think?

298
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,162
Oh, dear.
You're one of those.

299
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,677
You think we're
descended from apes?

300
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,178
Well, not recently, no.

301
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:21,180
Do I look like an ape to you?

302
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,683
Do I have hairy palms
and a big hairy back?

303
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,685
Would you like a drink?

304
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,687
Oh, yeah. Bring it on.

305
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:31,190
But I got to warn you--
I'm a horny drunk.

306
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,192
Last Spring,
in Cabo,

307
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,695
I wake up one morning
under a beach umbrella,

308
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,686
stark naked,
tequila bottle in one hand,

309
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,188
and some guy's
tightie-whities on my head.

310
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,334
(chuckling)

311
00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:44,403
Whoa, don't
I know you from Cabo?

312
00:11:44,403 --> 00:11:45,392
(laughs)

313
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:47,395
Remind you of anything?

314
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:48,896
You wish, right?

315
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:53,913
That's, uh, very amusing.

316
00:11:53,913 --> 00:11:56,404
So what do you do
for a living?

317
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:58,406
Well, right now
I'm back in school.

318
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:00,920
You see, I've loved animal
s my whole life

319
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,422
so I figured, why not really
go for it, you know?

320
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:04,924
So I'm going to become

321
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:07,927
a taxidermist.

322
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:09,929
Is something wrong?

323
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:11,430
No.

324
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:13,421
I was just, uh,
admiring your ensemble.

325
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:15,924
Thanks. I made it myself.

326
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:17,970
You know,

327
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:19,772
I have a lot
of this fabric left.

328
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:21,741
I could make you a shirt
with a matching hat.

329
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,042
Don't go to any trouble.

330
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:25,044
Would you like some wine?

331
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:27,747
Nah, the cops took my fake I.D.

332
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:30,750
and my dad'll kill me
if I get busted again.

333
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,742
So what are you, like, 50?

334
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:39,247
Something like that.

335
00:12:45,397 --> 00:12:46,398
Well, I'm off.

336
00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:47,900
No, you can't.

337
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,835
Our doula's coming
specifically to meet
you and your father.

338
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:51,837
She insists on knowing
all the members

339
00:12:51,837 --> 00:12:53,236
of the baby's
energy circle.

340
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:56,408
Oh, what kind of a kook
is she anyway?

341
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,144
Harvest is not a kook.

342
00:12:58,144 --> 00:13:00,513
She's assisted
at the birth

343
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:02,515
of more
than 600 babies

344
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:04,817
and two giant pandas.

345
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:06,185
She better
get here quickly.

346
00:13:06,185 --> 00:13:07,186
I do have a date.

347
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:08,888
Another one?

348
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:10,456
You're doing fairly well
by this matchmaker.

349
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:13,526
Oh, hardly. A monkey throwing
darts at the Seattle phone book

350
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:15,528
would find me a better mate.

351
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:19,521
Hell, a dart-throwing monkey
wouldbea better mate.

352
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:20,924
Why don't you fire her?

353
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:22,935
Don't think
I haven't considered it.

354
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:24,926
If tonight's a bust, I'm goito
demand my money back.

355
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:38,017
Niles...

356
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:39,919
have you gained weight?

357
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:41,011
Yes, but, you know,

358
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,015
you always put on a lot
with your first baby.

359
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:45,891
The hardest part

360
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:47,459
is the mood swings.

361
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:48,961
Jeez, Niles,

362
00:13:48,961 --> 00:13:50,963
don't you think
you're taking this

363
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:52,965
sympathetic pregnancy
thing too far?

364
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:56,969
I'm simply giving
in to the primal
cycle of life.

365
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:59,338
I have no control
over it.

366
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:02,241
In that case, get off my Chanel
couch before your water breaks.

367
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:03,943
Oh, hello.

368
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:05,244
I'm Dr. Frasier Crane.

369
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:07,246
Harvest Finkleman.
Delighted.

370
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:09,949
Oh. Well, I'm sorry I can't stay.

371
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:12,885
Niles and Daphne you know,
of course, and this is my dad,

372
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:14,887
Martin Crane.
Ms. Finkleman-Delighted.

373
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:16,555
Nice to meet you, Martin.

374
00:14:16,555 --> 00:14:18,357
Likewise.

375
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,359
So are you planning
to participate

376
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:22,094
in your grandchild's birth?

377
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:23,896
Oh, no. I'm kind of old school.

378
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:26,398
Clean the kid up,
slap a bow
on her head,

379
00:14:26,398 --> 00:14:28,889
then call me in.

380
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:30,393
Oh! Guess who
had their baby.

381
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:31,904
Brad and Cindy?

382
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:33,895
Oh, I'm so
happy for them!

383
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:38,978
He gets very
emotional lately.

384
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:40,546
It was a beautiful experience.

385
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,948
I made a tape,
if you'd like to see it.

386
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:45,109
I would like to not see it.

387
00:14:45,484 --> 00:14:49,054
No, no! This would be
good for us-- play it.

388
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:50,043
It was
an 1 8-hour labor.

389
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,558
This should be
about two hours into it.

390
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,059
I'm so excited.

391
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:56,161
Daphne, I can't wait
until this is us.

392
00:14:56,161 --> 00:14:59,130
(Cindy screaming on tape)

393
00:14:59,331 --> 00:15:01,100
Oh, look at Cindy glow.

394
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,268
CINDY:
Mother of God!

395
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:04,236
Just kill me!

396
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:09,108
(Cindy screaming on tape)

397
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:11,975
She seems like
she's in a little pain.

398
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:17,583
That's a boat load of fear.

399
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:23,022
CINDY: Stop that drum before
I put your head through it!

400
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:26,091
She laughed at that afterwards.

401
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,060
I've seen enough.

402
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,561
Wait, wait.

403
00:15:29,561 --> 00:15:32,064
You'll see how Cindy
pushes through the pain.

404
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:33,432
I'm not pushing
through anything.

405
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:36,335
I'm having my baby
the way God intended--

406
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:39,031
in a hospital,
numb from the waist down.

407
00:15:41,006 --> 00:15:42,074
Now take
your incense

408
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:44,065
and your woo-woo
stick and get out.

409
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,478
And you,
stop acting pregnant.

410
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:51,412
You're a man, for God sakes.

411
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:03,028
Charlotte,
where's my date?

412
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:06,031
I am so sorry.
She just called.
She had to cancel.

413
00:16:06,031 --> 00:16:07,032
That does it.

414
00:16:07,032 --> 00:16:08,021
No. We'll find
another evening.

415
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:09,335
No, Charlotte,
we will not.

416
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:11,030
You have sent me
on enough

417
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:13,038
miserable dates,
thank you.

418
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:17,031
Before you fix me up with
a doll-collecting war criminal

419
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:20,335
or a hashish-smoking
burger flipper, I want out.

420
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:22,348
And I want my money back.

421
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:24,976
Frasier, this...

422
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,284
this is a process.

423
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:31,648
I have only sent you out
on five dates.

424
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:34,526
Do you cure your patients
in five sessions?

425
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:36,195
Well, no, but...

426
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:37,355
This client roster

427
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:39,698
is filled
with fascinating women.

428
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:42,468
I just signed a new
one this morning--

429
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:45,537
botany professor, avid
bicycle rider, very striking.

430
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:46,538
But you know what?

431
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:48,529
If you're going
to be so impatient,

432
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:50,542
then we should
just end this now.

433
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:52,177
I'll write
you a check.

434
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:53,166
Well, wait.
No, no, no.

435
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,581
I'm sure you'?
I do much better
on your own.

436
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:59,618
With $ 1 0, 000, you can
download a lot of love.

437
00:16:59,618 --> 00:17:02,154
Well, let's not be too hasty.

438
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:07,182
That striking, biking botanist
sounded like me.

439
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:09,123
- I don't know.
- Please?

440
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,158
Don't beg. It's a turnoff.

441
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:13,832
All right.

442
00:17:13,832 --> 00:17:15,701
Why don't I get us some drinks,

443
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,703
and then we
can talk about
our next move?

444
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:19,694
Great.

445
00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:39,358
He's a big radio star.

446
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:41,360
Smart, really sweet.

447
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,055
So think about it.

448
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:44,351
Here's my card.

449
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,065
You lied to me.

450
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,054
You have five clients.

451
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:49,368
There is no roster
of eligible women!

452
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:51,070
You looked in
my client log?

453
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:55,074
t.
Yes. I've seen your log,
and I've dated every toad on i

454
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,842
Is this the guy?

455
00:17:56,842 --> 00:17:57,831
No, no, no.
Different guy. Call me.

456
00:18:01,513 --> 00:18:03,515
I think the police
might be interested

457
00:18:03,515 --> 00:18:04,504
in this little
scam of yours.

458
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:06,718
It is not a scam.

459
00:18:06,718 --> 00:18:09,788
I... I just didn't have time
to put the other pictures in.

460
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:12,791
And I will not work one second
with someone who threatens me.

461
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:14,226
I'll mail
you a check.

462
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:16,228
I'll save you
the price of a stamp.

463
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:18,730
I'll see you
at your office tomorrow.

464
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:21,221
Fine. I'd say come alone,
but that's a given.

465
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:27,127
Oh!

466
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:32,845
Oh, God! What
a crappy, crappy day!

467
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:35,280
Charlotte, are you okay?

468
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,849
I can't
give you a check.

469
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:39,852
I've already..
.. I've already
spent the money

470
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:41,687
on rent
and food and...

471
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:43,489
...and these shoes.

472
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:46,481
These stupid,
stupid shoes!

473
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:50,485
Come on, now.
It's okay.

474
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:53,187
.
No, it's not.
Nothing's okay

475
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:55,200
I lied to you.

476
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,503
I just started
this business.

477
00:18:57,503 --> 00:18:59,505
But I'm really good at what I do.

478
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:03,208
I used to run the
biggest matchmaking
business in Chicago

479
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:06,211
before I lost it to
my rotten ex-husband
in the divorce.

480
00:19:06,211 --> 00:19:09,214
Divorce? But you're
wearing a wedding ring.

481
00:19:09,214 --> 00:19:12,206
It's camouflage.

482
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:17,222
It inspires
confidence.

483
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:19,224
I mean, nobody
wants a matchmaker

485
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,465
I'm divorced.

486
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:29,168
My business
is a joke.

487
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,470
I'm-I'm up t
o my ass in debt.

488
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,972
I had to move in
with my mother.

489
00:19:33,972 --> 00:19:37,543
I am 35 years old,
and I am living with my mother.

490
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:39,534
How pathetic is that?

491
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:45,551
Well, I...
I've seen worse.

492
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:47,553
You mentioned
something earlier

493
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:49,248
about having a drink.

494
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:51,290
Oh, believe me,
I will.

495
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:54,560
If my mother hasn't
finished the bottle.

496
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,827
I meant here.

497
00:19:55,827 --> 00:19:58,330
No, I really can't.
I've got to get home.

498
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:00,332
I have paperwork.
I have calls to make.

499
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:01,333
It's my treat.

500
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:02,322
Double Scotch.

501
00:20:06,838 --> 00:20:10,330
So then I spent five
soul-sucking years
in advertising

502
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:12,742
dreaming up slogans
for Crunchios.

503
00:20:13,278 --> 00:20:15,581
"Crunchios are a munchy with
your lunchy or your brunchy"

504
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:16,715
That was you?

505
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,283
Yeah.

506
00:20:18,283 --> 00:20:20,774
I felt better about myself
when I was pushing cigarettes.

507
00:20:21,286 --> 00:20:22,651
Then, one day,
I fixed up my boss

508
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,357
with my friend, and they
ended up getting married.

509
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:28,292
And thus
a career was born.

510
00:20:28,493 --> 00:20:31,463
What better way to make a living
than by helping people be happy?

511
00:20:31,463 --> 00:20:34,499
So does your old boss
toast you every year

512
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:37,236
when he celebrates
his anniversary?

513
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:42,341
.
Actually, he's a she now,
and my friend's kind of bitter

514
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:44,002
But I got

515
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:46,912
the hang of it
after that.

516
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:51,008
Well, until I lost the business
and came here

517
00:20:51,483 --> 00:20:54,853
and moved in
with my crazy-ass mother.

518
00:20:54,853 --> 00:20:56,320
For what it's worth,

519
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:59,391
it will get easier
living with her.

520
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:00,959
Is that your
professional opinion?

521
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:03,462
Actually, it's a personal one.

522
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:05,364
My dad lives with me.

523
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:06,431
No.

524
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,899
Mm. 1 1 years.

525
00:21:07,899 --> 00:21:09,334
Yeah.
Yikes.

526
00:21:09,334 --> 00:21:12,437
It does take a while
to adjust to each other

527
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:14,373
before you're
perfectly in sync.

528
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:15,307
How long did that take?

529
00:21:15,307 --> 00:21:17,643
I'll let you know.

530
00:21:17,643 --> 00:21:19,845
Truth be told,

531
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:22,381
I'm going to miss him
when he moves out.

532
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:25,417
I was missing my mother
when I was in Chicago.

533
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:27,817
Now I just wish she was missing.

534
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:32,391
I didn't realize it was so late.

535
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:34,693
Frank's waiting for me at home.

536
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:36,395
Frank?

537
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:38,397
My boyfriend.

538
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:39,631
Oh. Serious?

539
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:42,429
Yes, but he has
a fun-loving side, too.

540
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:44,703
No, I meant the relationship.

541
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:47,072
Do you lie awake nights
thinking about him?

542
00:21:47,072 --> 00:21:50,041
A little.

543
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:53,412
It's still new, but I
have my fingers crossed.

544
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:55,447
Well, good luck with it.

545
00:21:55,447 --> 00:21:56,748
Thank you.

546
00:21:56,748 --> 00:21:57,737
And, if you'll let me,

547
00:21:58,450 --> 00:21:59,751
I'm going to find
someone fantastic

548
00:21:59,751 --> 00:22:01,753
for you, too, Frasier,
because you deserve it.

549
00:22:01,753 --> 00:22:05,457
And because you have my $ 1 0, 000.

550
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:07,755
Are you going to mention that
every time you see me?

551
00:22:27,879 --> 00:22:31,781
Damn.
