1
00:00:09,142 --> 00:00:10,110
It's official.

2
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,101
Dr. Lee says we're pregnant.

3
00:00:13,613 --> 00:00:16,116
Oh, I'm so excited .

4
00:00:16,116 --> 00:00:18,107
Hello in there .

5
00:00:18,618 --> 00:00:20,620
It's your pater .

6
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:21,609
Oh, stop it.

7
00:00:23,623 --> 00:00:26,126
So, how do you want to
make the announcement?

8
00:00:26,126 --> 00:00:28,128
Uh... Well, Frasier's on
his way over. We could...

9
00:00:28,128 --> 00:00:29,629
No.

10
00:00:29,629 --> 00:00:31,131
He's a blabber mouth.

11
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:33,133
Let's have him and your
dad over for dinner tonight

12
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:35,135
and we can tell them at the same time.

13
00:00:35,135 --> 00:00:36,636
If you already had a plan,

14
00:00:36,636 --> 00:00:38,138
why did you ask me
how I wanted to do it?

15
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:40,140
Well, because if you'd
have had the same idea,

16
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,641
then I could have agreed with it,

17
00:00:41,641 --> 00:00:43,632
which would have given you
the illusion of control.

18
00:00:45,645 --> 00:00:47,147
The waiting room had Cosmo.

19
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:48,648
Oh.

20
00:00:48,648 --> 00:00:50,650
All right.

21
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:51,651
I have just the quotation

22
00:00:51,651 --> 00:00:53,141
for the beginning of the announcement.

23
00:00:53,653 --> 00:00:55,143
It's from Robert Burns .

24
00:00:55,655 --> 00:00:57,657
"Beneath the shelter of an aged tree;

25
00:00:57,657 --> 00:01:02,151
"Th' expectant wee-things,
toddlin', stacher through

26
00:01:02,662 --> 00:01:06,655
To meet their dad, wi'
- filchterin' noise and glee

27
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:10,670
Moving, eh?

28
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:12,672
Yes, but not just because of the poem.

29
00:01:12,672 --> 00:01:14,674
I'm late for a hair appointment.

30
00:01:14,674 --> 00:01:15,675
Oh.

31
00:01:15,675 --> 00:01:17,177
Hi, you two. Hello.

32
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:18,178
Hi, Daph. Good to see you.

33
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:19,179
Hello, Niles.

34
00:01:19,179 --> 00:01:20,180
Hey.

35
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:22,182
Uh, my usual, please.

36
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:24,184
Well, I've ruined another relationship.

37
00:01:24,184 --> 00:01:26,686
I suppose you'll want to
hear the whole sorry tale.

38
00:01:26,686 --> 00:01:27,687
No, thank you.

39
00:01:27,687 --> 00:01:29,189
Last night, Julia came over

40
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:31,191
and, as usual, I made a mess of things.

41
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:32,692
Did you say no?

42
00:01:32,692 --> 00:01:34,694
I said, "No, thank you. "

43
00:01:34,694 --> 00:01:37,185
But I wish to unburden myself.

44
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:41,501
And I wish to remain in my good mood.

45
00:01:41,501 --> 00:01:42,502
Therefore, I demur.

46
00:01:42,502 --> 00:01:43,491
You demur? I demur.

47
00:01:45,505 --> 00:01:47,507
Besides, I'm sure I've
heard it all before .

48
00:01:47,507 --> 00:01:49,202
But this time was
different-- I really thought

49
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:51,500
BOTH: ...she could have been the one.

50
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:55,215
Well.

51
00:01:55,215 --> 00:01:57,217
Silly me.

52
00:01:57,217 --> 00:01:59,519
To think that I could
count on my only brother

53
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:01,521
for a shoulder on which to lean.

54
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:03,223
What you need isn't a shoulder.

55
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:04,224
It's a swift boot

56
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:05,213
to break you out of this pattern.

57
00:02:06,526 --> 00:02:07,527
What pattern?

58
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:09,229
Your pattern of ruining things

59
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:10,230
before they've even begun.

60
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:11,531
And when have I done that?

61
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:13,233
Let me see.

62
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:14,534
Fay. Cassandra.

63
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:16,229
Chelsea, Claire,

64
00:02:16,536 --> 00:02:18,538
Lana, Abby, Mia, Marie.

65
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:22,542
Oh, all right. I knew I had a pattern.

66
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:25,245
I just didn't think
you'd remember the names.

67
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:27,247
The minute you develop
feelings for someone

68
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:30,250
you get scared and find
some way to sabotage things.

69
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,551
I'd like to strike you, of course,

70
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:33,553
but you speak the truth.

71
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:37,190
I tell you what, I will never
find a happy relationship

72
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:39,181
un-unless I can break out
of this maddening cycle.

73
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:41,194
Well, all right, all right.

74
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:43,496
The next time you find
yourself doing it again--

75
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:46,199
fixating, say, on some
tiny fault of the woman--

76
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:48,497
recognize what that is,
you're feeling vulnerable,

77
00:02:49,202 --> 00:02:50,499
ear. but don't give in to the f

78
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:53,195
Commit to commitment .

79
00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:55,508
Commit to commitment.

80
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:57,203
Yes.

81
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:00,547
It's a bit glib, but
nonetheless inspiring.

82
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:01,514
Thank you, Niles.

83
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:03,216
I'm going to call Julia

84
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:06,219
and I will not take "no" for an answer.

85
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:07,220
I may have walked in here

86
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,211
the old fault-finding,
flaw-fleeing Flasier,

87
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:11,217
but I leave a man
committed to commitment.

88
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:16,229
You said "Flasier. "

89
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:17,530
id. I did not. Yes, you d

90
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,232
I most certainly did not.

91
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:20,233
No, I heard you say "Flasier. "

92
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:21,234
I've been saying my own name

93
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:22,531
for the last 40-some odd years.

94
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:23,531
I know, but your tongue...

95
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:30,777
Oh.

96
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:32,278
Hi, Dad.

97
00:03:32,278 --> 00:03:33,780
Before you say anything,

98
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,281
if you know the score
to the Mariners game,

99
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:38,284
don't tell me-- I'm
taping it to watch later.

100
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:39,273
Dad, the odds of my knowing the score

101
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:40,775
to the Mariners game are about the same

102
00:03:41,287 --> 00:03:43,221
as you knowing the score
to Pacific Overtures.

103
00:03:44,857 --> 00:03:46,347
Did, uh, Julia call? No. Sorry.

104
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:48,224
Oh, damn.

105
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:51,397
Well, at least this little
delivery will cheer me up.

106
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:54,400
My new Frette hand towels have arrived.

107
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,702
(gloating laughter)

108
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:59,405
Direct from Italy, I give
you the spugna con frangia

109
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:01,708
with the tulle lace insert, huh?

110
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:02,709
Sounds fancy.

111
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:05,411
Am I allowed to dry my hands on them?

112
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:06,713
Well, you may miss the luxurious feel

113
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:08,408
of your trouser fronts, but yes.

114
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:13,419
You know, if you're really
down about this Julia thing,

115
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:15,421
you can come with me
and Eddie to the circus.

116
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,355
We're really going
to the v-E- T,

117
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:20,360
but if I say that, he
won't get in the car.

118
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,662
Thanks anyway, Dad.

119
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:24,364
I'll just see you at Nile's and Daphne'?

120
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:25,353
for dinner, all right?

121
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:27,367
Maybe I'll take in a movie

122
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:29,369
Oh, what are you going
to go see? Well, there's

123
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:31,360
this new Russian film in t
own about a Crimean war vet.

124
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:33,673
No, Eddie!

125
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:36,676
Would it have killed you
to say "Crimean War circus"?

126
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:38,378
Oh, for heaven's sake.

127
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:40,380
I'm so sorry, Dad. I...

128
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,381
Oh, well...

129
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:42,382
Julia.

130
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:44,684
You got my message.

131
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:46,379
What message? I actually came

132
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:49,689
because I think I dropped
an earring here last night.

133
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:51,680
Oh. I'm... I'm sorry. Please, come in.

134
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:56,396
So, what did it look like?

135
00:04:56,396 --> 00:04:59,699
Oh, it was just a small diamond stud.

136
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:02,402
Right. Okay, yea h, you check there.

137
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:03,699
So, uh, what was this message?

138
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:07,407
Um... Oh, I just said that

139
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:10,399
I found you bright and, uh,

140
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:12,712
beautiful and engaging,

141
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:14,703
and then...

142
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:18,408
There was a sonnet.

143
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:26,526
"Fair love's ship ne'er
sa ilo'er unstorm'd seas."

144
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:30,018
The fickle stars, her
compass, bright and cruel... "

145
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:34,367
It's pretty sappy stuff, huh ?

146
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:36,569
No, it's sweet.

147
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:38,071
Especially the end.

148
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:39,539
So you did hear it.

149
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:41,040
Yes, but, Frasier...

150
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,042
I'm not looking for
just some office romance.

151
00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:44,544
I don't see the point
in getting involved

152
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:46,546
unless it's heading somewhere.

153
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:48,548
That's exactly where
I am in my life, too.

154
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:51,050
After you walked out last night,

155
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:52,552
I realized how badly I want

156
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:54,554
to be in a real relationship,

157
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:56,055
how ready I am to...

158
00:05:56,055 --> 00:05:58,057
well, for want of a better phrase,

159
00:05:58,057 --> 00:06:01,049
to commit to commitment.

160
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:05,064
You're not just saying this
to get in my pants, are you?

161
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:06,566
No.

162
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:08,568
And if I did... get in your pants,

163
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:12,060
well... I'd want t o stay there forever.

164
00:06:14,006 --> 00:06:17,009
I-I-I said that much more
elegantly in the sonnet.

165
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:18,511
You know, I just remembered

166
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:20,513
where I may have lost my earring.

167
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:21,502
Really? Where? In your bedroom.

168
00:06:22,014 --> 00:06:24,016
Do you care to help me look?

169
00:06:24,016 --> 00:06:26,507
In my bed... Well, we were
never in my bedroom. I don 't...

170
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:30,156
Oh.

171
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:32,147
I see.

172
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,802
Let's hope Frasier's ove n
is more reliable than ours.

173
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:45,498
MARTIN: Well, it serves you right
for getting such a fancy one.

174
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:47,473
Oh, it's just temperamental.

175
00:06:47,473 --> 00:06:49,475
My Gaggenau is German-engineered.

176
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:50,772
It probably needs more power

177
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:53,479
than my building's
old wiring can give it.

178
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:55,777
Yeah, well, leave
it to the Germans--

179
00:06:56,482 --> 00:06:59,585
even their appliances crave power.

180
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:01,988
So, when do you want to
make the big announcement?

181
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:03,956
I think a toast before dinner.

182
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:06,459
Let's hope Frasier checks
his messages after the movie,

183
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:07,960
or he'll be heading over to our place.

184
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,949
Yes, well, I'm sure he will.

185
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:10,463
It's just as well

186
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:12,465
not to have him here
while we're cooking.

187
00:07:12,465 --> 00:07:14,467
I can't stand his backseat basting.

188
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:16,969
I was just dreaming about us.

189
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:17,970
We were in a boat,

190
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:20,506
floating down the Arno River.

191
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:22,497
Have you ever been to fair Firenze?

192
00:07:22,975 --> 00:07:23,976
Oh, it's maybe my favorite city.

193
00:07:23,976 --> 00:07:25,978
Oh. Mine, too.

194
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:26,967
Oh, I knew we'd be a good couple.

195
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,981
Have you ever gone there for Christmas?

196
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:29,970
No. I've always wanted to.

197
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:31,484
Me, too.

198
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:32,985
Well, then, let's go.

199
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:33,953
Do you mean it?

200
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:35,588
It sounds perfect.

201
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:36,856
I'll tell you what.

202
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:39,552
Let's toast this decision
with a glass of Chianti.

203
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:40,553
Ooh, that sounds good.

204
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:41,861
Oh, shoot.

205
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:43,563
What?

206
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:45,164
I just remembered-- I'm
supposed to have dinner

207
00:07:45,164 --> 00:07:46,999
at my brother and his
wife's house tonight.

208
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:49,235
Uh... I'm just going to call and cancel.

209
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:51,066
(phone ringing)

210
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:53,573
Hello.

211
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:55,575
Niles, it-it's Frasier. Listen . .

212
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:56,576
I just got out of the movie,

213
00:07:56,576 --> 00:07:58,578
and it was so cold in the theater

214
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:00,079
that I-I think I've...

215
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:01,581
(with a hoarse voice)
: I think I've come down

216
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:04,083
with a little something,
and, uh, I just... I just...

217
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:06,074
I'm afraid I'm begging
out of tonight, all right?

218
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:07,587
Oh, I hardly think

219
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:09,088
a little dinner will make you worse.

220
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:10,556
And besides, we've
had a change of plans.

221
00:08:10,556 --> 00:08:12,558
Niles, for God sakes,
I just want to go home

222
00:08:12,558 --> 00:08:13,926
and get into bed.

223
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:16,262
But Daphne and I have
put a lot of effort

224
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:17,763
into making a very nice dinner.

225
00:08:17,763 --> 00:08:18,752
I can't help it if I'm sick.

226
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:21,256
What if I catch pneumonia?

227
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:32,712
If that's what you wear to the movies,

228
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:36,716
it's your own damn fault.

229
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:38,084
What the hell are you doing here?

230
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:39,552
My oven's on the fritz.

231
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:41,187
We left you a message hours ago.

232
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,588
Oh, I'm sorry, Niles.

233
00:08:42,588 --> 00:08:44,078
Um, you remember Julia, of course.

234
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:48,594
Well, if he didn't before,
he certainly will now.

235
00:08:48,594 --> 00:08:50,596
Excuse me.

236
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:51,597
You lied to me.

237
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:52,598
Oh, I'm sorry.

238
00:08:52,598 --> 00:08:54,600
Would you have rather I told you

239
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,102
that I was inflagrante delicto?

240
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:57,262
No, no.

241
00:08:57,737 --> 00:08:59,105
But you're still not
excused from dinner.

242
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:01,096
Julia and I will delighted to attend.

243
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:03,109
We weren't planning on including Julia.

244
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:04,098
Well, what do you want me to do,

245
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:05,611
give her 50 bucks and
tell her to beat it?

246
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:07,113
Oh.

247
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:08,614
Ten years?

248
00:09:08,614 --> 00:09:10,616
I... If I still needed
a cane after that long,

249
00:09:10,616 --> 00:09:12,118
I'd dump my physical therapist

250
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:15,621
and find one who knows
what they're doing.

251
00:09:15,621 --> 00:09:17,612
Hello.

252
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:19,113
Well, actually, this is her.

253
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:21,127
She's also my
daughter-in-law.

254
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:21,991
Daphne, this is Julia.

255
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:24,664
Sorry about that. I...

256
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:25,665
That's all right.

257
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:26,962
And just so you know,

258
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:28,968
more. he wouldn't need the
can e so much if he'd stretch

259
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:30,670
I would have thought
that part of your job

260
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:31,671
was making sure he stretched.

261
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:32,972
Yes, but...

262
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:34,674
I can't be her e day and night.

263
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:35,975
Oh.

264
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:37,977
I'm sorry. For some reason
I thought you lived here.

265
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:39,968
Well, I don't.

266
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:46,619
How about some Mozart to
makes things festive, hmm?

267
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:47,920
(music plays)

268
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,622
Ah.

269
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:51,817
Well, I'm not sure
I'd call that festive.

270
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,759
Well, then, you'd be wrong,

271
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:57,196
as it is from the
Salzburg Music Festival.

272
00:09:57,196 --> 00:09:59,198
How about something a
little more contemporary?

273
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:00,600
Well, all right. I believe I have...

274
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,602
Oh, Michael's Nyman's
The Contemporary Trumpet.

275
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,604
What are you, a hundred?

276
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,739
All right.

277
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:08,040
Nothing then, my little wasp.

278
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,742
(laughs)

279
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:12,044
Oh, thank you, Niles.
Thank you very much.

280
00:10:12,044 --> 00:10:12,738
go. There you

281
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:15,748
Oh, perfect. Thank you.

282
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:17,049
NILES: Oh, uh...

283
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:18,718
Here you go. There you are.

284
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:19,719
She took my... Just take it.

285
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:20,708
Just take it. She took my...

286
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,888
I don't care. Just take it.

287
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:24,719
She, uh...

288
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:26,726
shoots from the hip, this one.

289
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:28,216
(laughs): Yes.

290
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:29,729
You should hear what
she says about my show.

291
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:31,219
Oh, I just have to
remind Mr. Pompous here

292
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:33,733
that what we do on the
radio is entertainment.

293
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:35,668
Well... NILES: Yes, Frasier

294
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:37,770
and I have had many a
chat about the difference

295
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:39,071
between what he does
and genuine psychiatry.

296
00:10:39,071 --> 00:10:40,773
Yeah, big difference.

297
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:42,070
I mean, at least his advice is free,

298
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:43,776
not like those quacks

299
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:45,073
who charge people 200 bucks an hour

300
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:47,079
to whine about their childhoods.

301
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:49,775
I mean, what a racket that is.

302
00:10:52,084 --> 00:10:54,382
Frasier, may I see you in the kitchen?

303
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:02,061
Frasier. What are you
doing in the kitchen?

304
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:03,729
You just asked to see me.

305
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:07,700
Ah. So you haven't gone deaf.

306
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,792
Why would I have gone deaf?

307
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:10,302
Because that's the only good reason

308
00:11:10,302 --> 00:11:13,172
you sat there silently while
our profession was assaulted

309
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:16,664
Like  a drag queen at a tractor pull.

310
00:11:16,976 --> 00:11:18,068
Niles, don't be so sensitive.

311
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:20,079
That is one of the
qualities I admire most

312
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,013
about Julia-- her
bracing frankness.

313
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:23,716
Now, listen, listen. What?

314
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:25,707
It is partially because of your advice

315
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:28,187
that I have chosen to
commit myself to this woman,

316
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:30,056
so please, at least give her a chance.

317
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:33,259
You're right. If
you're happy, I'm happy.

318
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:34,794
Ah, thanks.

319
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:37,092
Help me serve. Right. Right. Okay.

320
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:40,132
Dinner is served, everyone.

321
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:42,134
If you'd come and take a seat.

322
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:44,125
Here we are. Daph,
why don't you sit here

323
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:48,140
Julia, have a seat there,
and I'll sit right next to you

324
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,141
NILES: Thanks, Dad.

325
00:11:49,141 --> 00:11:51,811
And before we begin,

326
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:54,013
I would like to share
some words of Robert Burns

327
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:57,483
which have recently become
quite meaningful to me.

328
00:11:57,483 --> 00:12:00,986
"Beneath the shelter
of an aged tree... "

329
00:12:00,986 --> 00:12:02,488
(cell phone ringing) Whoops. That's me.

330
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:03,989
Hello?

331
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:05,491
Hey. What's up?

332
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:07,482
No, no, I can talk.

333
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:10,362
Well, what kind of crap is that?

334
00:12:10,362 --> 00:12:11,831
Nail their asses to the wall.

335
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:13,032
Is that chicken?

336
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:14,260
No, partridge.

337
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,892
Yes, in a champagne and orange sauce.

338
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:18,204
'Cause he's a pissy
little bitch, that's why.

339
00:12:18,204 --> 00:12:21,907
I'm sorry. I don't eat birds
They live in their own feces.

340
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:23,898
More for me.

341
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,212
I'll just get some cereal.

342
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:27,913
Well, let him sue.

343
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:29,215
got I'm starting to think you've

344
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:31,917
a little pair of panties
on under that suit.

345
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:36,222
You know, she really does work too hard.

346
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:37,790
Back to what I was saying.

347
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,792
"Beneath the shelter
of an aged tree... "

348
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:41,093
JULIA: Okay,

349
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:42,795
I give up-- where do
you keep your cereal?

350
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:44,096
(chuckles) : Please, Julia, sit.

351
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:46,098
We'll find you something.

352
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:47,099
Oh, are you sure?

353
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,801
"Beneath the shelter of an aged... "

354
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:49,460
Niles.

355
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:54,996
Let's not do this
tonight-- not with her here.

356
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:56,497
I want it to be perfect.

357
00:12:57,009 --> 00:12:59,512
You're right. We'll just...
We'll just pick a better moment.

358
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:00,513
I'll still be pregnant tomorrow.

359
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:02,014
Exactly.

360
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:03,504
Well, congratulations, Niles.

361
00:13:04,016 --> 00:13:07,019
Frasier didn't tell me
that Daphne was pregnant.

362
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:08,521
What?

363
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:09,522
She is?

364
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:11,012
Oh, no, don't tell me

365
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:13,014
she's just paunchy.

366
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:16,529
She's not paunchy. She's pregnant!

367
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:18,019
Niles!

368
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:21,967
How could you do that?

369
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,469
JULIA: I'm sorry.

370
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:25,471
It's my fault. I heard
you in the kitchen.

371
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:26,972
I didn't realize it was a big deal.

372
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:28,974
Well, what does it matter

373
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:30,976
how we came to know this glorious news?

374
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:32,478
Niles! It's just wonderful !

375
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:33,979
Two words: C-section.

376
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:35,481
My sister's about your size,

377
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:38,473
and when she had her kid,
it blew out the whole region.

378
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:47,924
Can I have cereal, too?

379
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:54,333
So, the more pregnantshegets,

380
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,335
the more the husband hits on me .

381
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,304
And by the way, she was a model.

382
00:13:58,304 --> 00:13:59,305
(phone rings)

383
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:00,306
Whoops.

384
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:01,841
That's me.

385
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,176
Hello? Hey, how you doing?

386
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:07,873
No, I'm just... meeting
my boyfriend's family.

387
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,153
Isn't this fun?

388
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:21,994
I'm having a good time.

389
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:23,484
It's fun, isn't it?

390
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:28,297
She certainly takes a lot
of calls at dinnertime.

391
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:30,603
You know, that's exactly
the kind of... flaw

392
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:32,104
that the old Frasier would have...

393
00:14:32,104 --> 00:14:34,607
seized upon as pretext
to end the relationship,

394
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:36,598
but I-I know now that...
that impulse to run

395
00:14:37,109 --> 00:14:39,111
is-is really an indication
that my feelings for her

396
00:14:39,111 --> 00:14:40,601
are just deepening, and, um...

397
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:45,351
Gone are the days

398
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:47,653
when I would have said something like...

399
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:49,288
(exhales sharply)

400
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:50,983
"How rude. "

401
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:54,987
Or "She's horrible.

402
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:57,990
I've made a ghastly, ghastly mistake. "

403
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:04,003
Hey, Marty, you're a Mariners fan.

404
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:05,994
They won in the tenth on a grand slam.

405
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:12,044
Who's ready to play

406
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:13,545
that game of Pictionary we talked about?

407
00:15:13,545 --> 00:15:14,914
I know I am.

408
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:15,347
(forced laughter)

409
00:15:15,347 --> 00:15:16,336
Let me... just get that.

410
00:15:16,982 --> 00:15:18,017
Dad, I'll tell you what.

411
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:19,985
I know how much you like to keep time,

412
00:15:19,985 --> 00:15:20,974
so you'll be the timer,

413
00:15:21,353 --> 00:15:23,355
and then, it'll be me and Julia

414
00:15:23,355 --> 00:15:26,017
versus Niles and Daphne. How about that?

415
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:27,960
Oh, that sounds good to me.

416
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,962
FRASIER: Daphne, what do
you say you draw first?

417
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:30,951
Okay.

418
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:34,597
Mm-hmm. All right.

419
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,101
Oh, boy.

420
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:37,436
(chuckles)

421
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:39,104
Okay.

422
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:42,130
Ready, set... go.

423
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:48,070
The Ring of the Nibelungen.

424
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,682
Right! Damn!

425
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:50,983
Wow!

426
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:53,018
Well... congratulations, you two.

427
00:15:53,018 --> 00:15:54,019
(forced laughter)

428
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:55,008
Great.

429
00:15:55,387 --> 00:15:56,388
All right, enough of that.

430
00:15:56,388 --> 00:15:58,023
Get your head in the game.

431
00:15:58,023 --> 00:15:59,024
We're starting from behind.

432
00:15:59,024 --> 00:16:01,026
Right, right. Okay, here we go.

433
00:16:01,026 --> 00:16:02,394
Now...

434
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:04,029
Yeah.

435
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:05,397
All right.

436
00:16:05,397 --> 00:16:07,399
Okay, Dad.

437
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:08,297
Go.

438
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:10,602
JULIA: A ball, a balloon.

439
00:16:10,602 --> 00:16:12,160
Oh, an apple!

440
00:16:13,238 --> 00:16:14,227
Uh, the circle of life.

441
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:17,072
Uh, I don't know.

442
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:20,145
Yeah, I'm looking at it.

443
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:21,580
Maybe if you point
at it harder, I'll get it

444
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,082
Give me something to work with, dummy.

445
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:25,117
Oh, a hat!

446
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:26,151
Oh, the Cat in the Hat!

447
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,987
Uh, Abraham Lincoln!

448
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,154
Time.

449
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,656
(screeching): Oh,From Here to Eternity!

450
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:31,645
I got that in!

451
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:35,761
No, that's, that'? not it. Uh...

452
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:37,529
What the hell is it?

453
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:42,626
It's a cherry with a mustache,
and, uh, wearing a sombrero.

454
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:45,568
It's "Cherry Garcia. "

455
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:53,267
Oh, my God, that is the
worst drawing I've ever seen.

456
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:54,268
I mean, even these cheaters

457
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:55,781
wouldn't have gotten that one.

458
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:57,182
Cheaters?

459
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:58,817
I saw you guys mouthing at each other.

460
00:16:58,817 --> 00:16:59,818
And I think Father Time here

461
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:01,820
cut us off a little early, too.

462
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:04,323
Here, give me that pen.
I'll show you how it's done.

463
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:05,824
Sit down.

464
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:07,815
Oh, my God, I mean,
this painting is j...

465
00:17:09,628 --> 00:17:12,131
(choking)

466
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:15,225
(continues choking and coughing)

467
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,336
Oh, dear God!

468
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:24,843
Are you all right?

469
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:26,845
Oh... yes, I just...

470
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:28,347
(coughs)

471
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:30,338
I think I need to splash a
little cold water on my face.

472
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:32,351
Let me just, uh, walk
you to the powder room.

473
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:33,340
I'm sorry.

474
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:35,354
Well, that's, uh, that's okay.

475
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:37,845
You just take as long as you need.

476
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,726
Shame on you!

477
00:17:46,498 --> 00:17:48,500
That woman couldn'tbreathe,

478
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,503
and the three of you just sat there!

479
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:53,806
You didn't exactly jump in yourself.

480
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:55,603
That's because I mistook her choking

481
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:58,541
for a sarcastic comment
on my Pictionary play!

482
00:17:58,977 --> 00:18:00,112
You, on the other hand,

483
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:02,103
were content to let the woman
I love die before your eyes.

484
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:04,176
That's right! I said I love her !

485
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:07,352
Oh, knock it off, Frasier.

486
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:08,754
You don't love her

487
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,255
You're just trying to talk yourself

488
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:12,553
into honoring your
ill-advised commitment.

489
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:15,127
How dare you presume to know
the workings of my heart?

490
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:16,495
You can't understand
the kind of feelings

491
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:17,863
Julia and I have for one another.

492
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:20,132
You may as well ask me
to describe the essence

493
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:22,501
of music or the, the
col or of starlight!

494
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:23,934
Nice towels, Frasier.

495
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:27,337
You'd think a couple of
old ladies lived here.

496
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:29,470
Get out.

497
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:34,246
Excuse me?

498
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:36,237
I said get out!

499
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:38,884
I'm sorry. Have you just lost your mind?

500
00:18:38,884 --> 00:18:42,187
No. That happened earlier
when we slept together.

501
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:43,484
Are you breaking up with me?

502
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:45,524
You're damn right I am!

503
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:46,792
I want my purse.

504
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:49,352
And I, my hand towel.

505
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,432
I can't believe this.

506
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:55,934
You're actually kicking me out ?

507
00:18:55,934 --> 00:18:59,392
Do you want me to draw you a picture?

508
00:18:59,404 --> 00:19:00,803
We'd be here all night!

509
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:02,230
Get out!

510
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:10,182
(pouring)

511
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:11,617
With this bottle, I would like to both

512
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:14,153
commemorate and apologize
for this evening.

513
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,142
Daphne, Niles,

514
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:17,456
this should have been your evening,

515
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:19,720
and I selfishly monopolized
every moment of it.

516
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:22,758
Frasier... Not yet, Niles.

517
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:25,459
Anyway,

518
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:28,491
I handled things badly...

519
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:30,936
both with Julia and with you,

520
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:32,938
and I just hope that you can forgive me.

521
00:19:32,938 --> 00:19:34,606
Of course we will.

522
00:19:34,606 --> 00:19:36,341
Oh, look on the bright side.

523
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:38,172
You could've let her choke to death,

524
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:40,078
but you didn't

525
00:19:40,078 --> 00:19:42,911
Well, then, uh, to life,
both the old and the new.

526
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:44,216
(all chuckling)

527
00:19:44,216 --> 00:19:45,513
Ah.

528
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:51,623
Niles, I'm so proud of you.

529
00:19:51,623 --> 00:19:52,521
Thank you.

530
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:54,960
I'm excited for you , Daphne .

531
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,462
Takes me back to when I had my kids.

532
00:19:57,462 --> 00:19:59,965
What are you hoping for, boy or girl?

533
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:00,966
Oh, I don't know.

534
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:02,968
Be sort of nice to have a boy.

535
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:03,969
Niles,

536
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:05,459
just look at the edging on this.

537
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:07,461
Have you ever? Have you ever?

538
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:09,474
And look at... this
is all hand-stitched.

539
00:20:09,474 --> 00:20:10,976
Mm-hmm.
