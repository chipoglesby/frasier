1
00:00:09,609 --> 00:00:11,111
Oh, hello, Dad. Hi, Niles.

2
00:00:11,111 --> 00:00:12,612
May I get my usual, please?

3
00:00:12,612 --> 00:00:14,603
Niles, we're playing
squash in 20 minutes.

4
00:00:15,115 --> 00:00:16,104
Where are your togs?

5
00:00:16,616 --> 00:00:18,118
Oh, yes, I had to hide
them in my briefcase.

6
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:19,619
I told Daphne I was
seeing patients all day.

7
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:21,121
It was the only way I could get out

8
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:22,110
of driving her to this flower show.

9
00:00:22,622 --> 00:00:23,623
It's two hours there and back.

10
00:00:23,623 --> 00:00:25,125
I see; well, we could have rescheduled.

11
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:26,615
Did you really have to lie?

12
00:00:27,127 --> 00:00:28,617
Did I mention we'd be
joined by Daphne's mother,

13
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:30,630
who's suffering from
some female complaint

14
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,132
and can't get it through her head

15
00:00:32,132 --> 00:00:33,531
that I'm not a gynecologist?

16
00:00:33,767 --> 00:00:38,071
Ah. Well, then, you
had to save yourself.

17
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:40,440
so, please, don't tell anyone
we're playing squash today.

18
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,442
I can't have it getting back to Daphne.

19
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:43,443
Right. Hey, guys.

20
00:00:43,443 --> 00:00:44,432
I'm so glad you're here.

21
00:00:45,145 --> 00:00:46,146
You can meet my new boyfriend.

22
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:47,447
He's the hottest guy
I've dated since.. .

23
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:48,448
Frasier.

24
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:50,439
Okay, the hottest guy

25
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:53,453
(cracking up) ; since Frasier.

26
00:00:53,453 --> 00:00:55,155
That's Alistair Burke.

27
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:56,144
I know!

28
00:00:56,322 --> 00:00:58,258
Who's Alistair Burke?

29
00:00:58,258 --> 00:00:59,247
He is only the head of
the seattle Opera Guild

30
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:01,261
and one of the finest
directors in the world.

31
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:02,562
His productions are brilliant.

32
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:04,264
He staged a Philip
Glass opera last year,

33
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:05,561
and no one left.

34
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:07,563
Alistair, uh, it's, it's Frasier Crane.

35
00:01:08,268 --> 00:01:09,569
Uh, we met last year
at the fund-raiser.

36
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:10,570
Of course.

37
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,272
You're on the radio.

38
00:01:12,272 --> 00:01:12,567
Yes, yes.

39
00:01:13,273 --> 00:01:14,262
And you're... don't tell me.

40
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:18,178
All right, tell me.

41
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:20,146
Niles Crane.

42
00:01:20,146 --> 00:01:22,215
Yes, we've both got
ticket s to your premiere,

43
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:23,216
and, oh, we can't wait to see

44
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:24,517
what magic you'll work with La Boheme.

45
00:01:24,517 --> 00:01:26,519
Well, I would be content

46
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:29,522
if my Mimi would just
lay off the cheeseburgers.

47
00:01:29,522 --> 00:01:31,524
I sat her down yesterday and I said,

48
00:01:31,524 --> 00:01:33,526
'You're dying of consumption, dear,

49
00:01:33,526 --> 00:01:35,221
not overcon sumption. "

50
00:01:35,528 --> 00:01:36,517
(both guffawing)

51
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:39,232
FRAsIER; Oh, that's hilarious!

52
00:01:39,232 --> 00:01:40,233
It's funny because it's bitchy.

53
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:41,234
How well you're looking.

54
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:42,535
Oh, thank you.

55
00:01:42,535 --> 00:01:43,229
I like your suit.

56
00:01:43,536 --> 00:01:44,537
Well, you're too kind.

57
00:01:44,537 --> 00:01:46,539
And it's nice to see you again.

58
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:48,241
Bye-bye.

59
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:50,243
Take care.

60
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:51,437
Wow, that was thorough.

61
00:01:51,811 --> 00:01:53,870
Find any polyps up there?

62
00:01:56,816 --> 00:01:59,385
We were merely paying due respect

63
00:01:59,385 --> 00:02:02,322
to one of the giants of the opera world.

64
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:03,690
Hey! Barry, hi.

65
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:06,181
This is Frasier and Niles...

66
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:07,694
and Martin.

67
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:08,695
Hi. Hi.

68
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:10,697
Whoa, strong handshake.

69
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:12,365
You look like you work out a lot.

70
00:02:12,365 --> 00:02:14,458
He practically lives at the gym.

71
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,157
Well, it's my church .

72
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:18,460
Oh, this blouse looks amazing on you.

73
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:19,873
Yes, it's very chic, Roz.

74
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:21,374
Well, Barry picked it out.

75
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:22,876
He's the women's wear buyer at Bidwells.

76
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:24,878
He spent a whole day last
week going through my closet

77
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:27,881
and throwing out all the
stuff I shouldn't wear anymore.

78
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:30,383
You should have seen what
she was still hanging on to.

79
00:02:30,383 --> 00:02:31,372
Culottes.

80
00:02:31,684 --> 00:02:33,753
stop it.

81
00:02:33,753 --> 00:02:35,755
Well...

82
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:37,757
one wonders what's
been in Barry's closet

83
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:38,746
a little too long.

84
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:43,928
What are you talking about?

85
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:45,856
Oh, come on. He didn't seem gay to you ?

86
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:47,867
That guy's not gay.

87
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:49,858
You know how you can tell?

88
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,304
The muscles.

89
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,575
Good point, Dad.

90
00:02:55,575 --> 00:02:57,566
second tip-off; no poodle.

91
00:02:59,445 --> 00:03:02,282
so, isn't he fabulous?

92
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:05,885
Yes, yes, uh, fabulous
sums it up in a word.

93
00:03:05,885 --> 00:03:08,388
I think he's perfect
for you, Roz--

94
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:11,255
good-looking, friendly
and not gay at all.

95
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:13,593
Who said he was gay?

96
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:14,594
Not me.

97
00:03:14,594 --> 00:03:15,583
He's not gay.

98
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:17,285
All right, Roz, but you can see

99
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:19,299
how someone might get that impression.

100
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:20,300
Why, because of his job?

101
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,597
Because he takes care of himself?

102
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:24,304
That is just such lazy, stereotypical...

103
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:26,306
You're right; it was a
shallow knee-jerk assumption

104
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:27,607
and unworthy of us both

105
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:28,869
as psychiatrists and men about town.

106
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:33,379
We better go. We're
going to miss the movie.

107
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,681
Right. Bye.

108
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:35,670
No biscotti for you?

109
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:37,371
Please. I'm a house.

110
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:42,382
(no audio)

111
00:03:48,494 --> 00:03:49,495
Can't you walk any faster?

112
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:50,997
I'm moving as fast as I can

113
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:52,498
in these ridiculous shorts of yours.

114
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:54,000
You wouldn't need them

115
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,501
if you hadn't burs t out of your own.

116
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:56,490
I did not burst out of them.

117
00:03:57,003 --> 00:03:58,504
My laundress simply over bleached them

118
00:03:58,504 --> 00:04:01,007
till they had the tensile
strength of a cobweb.

119
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:02,008
If you're in such a hurry,

120
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:03,509
you should have brought your own car.

121
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:05,011
Daphne needed it for her flower show.

122
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:07,013
And remember... Yes, yes.

123
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:08,503
You were seeing patients.

124
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:10,516
We did not play squash.

125
00:04:10,516 --> 00:04:12,006
Is that Roz's boy friend ?

126
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,356
Oh, you don't suppose she told him

127
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:17,657
what we were saying about him?

128
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:19,425
No, I can't imagine she would do that.

129
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:20,414
Let's just act natural.

130
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,665
Where did he go?

131
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:27,530
Odd. He was just here.

132
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:31,303
"Bad Billy's?"

133
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:33,294
What sort of place do you think that is?

134
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:35,308
Well, let's see.

135
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:37,810
Tuesday is leather night,

136
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:40,643
so it's probably some
sort of shoe outlet.

137
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,284
It's a gay bar, you idiot.

138
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,585
Come on. Let's go.

139
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:47,287
What?! No!

140
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,588
I told Daphne

141
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:50,283
I was seeing patients until 7:00.

142
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,292
If I'm late, she might get suspicious.

143
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,993
Niles, Roz is my friend.

144
00:04:53,993 --> 00:04:54,994
I'm not going to let her get hurt

145
00:04:54,994 --> 00:04:56,996
by some man who's lying
to her about himself.

146
00:04:56,996 --> 00:04:58,486
I'll be just a minute.

147
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:07,507
Excuse me. Uh, I'm looking for a guy.

148
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:09,873
Yeah, I kind of got
that from the shorts.

149
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:12,333
It's a particular guy.

150
00:05:12,845 --> 00:05:13,846
He's about 35 years...

151
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:14,847
Frasier?

152
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:16,349
Eduardo!

153
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:20,353
My furniture polisher.

154
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:22,355
Don't tell me you put
away paste and chamois

155
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:23,356
for life as a barkeep.

156
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:24,957
I just do this on the side.

157
00:05:24,957 --> 00:05:27,527
Oh, well, bet you're
surprised to see me in here.

158
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:29,154
Okay.

159
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:31,922
All right, look,

160
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:33,900
I thought I saw a friend
of mine come in here.

161
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:37,631
He's, uh, mid-30s, uh,
wavy hair, good build.

162
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:38,971
Yeah, I think he's in the bathroom.

163
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:40,473
Oh. Oh.

164
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:41,462
(music blaring)

165
00:05:41,974 --> 00:05:43,464
Can I get you a drink?

166
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,970
sherry, please.

167
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:02,495
Oh, hi, Niles.

168
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,792
Hey, Barry.

169
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,501
Frasier. Barry's not here.

170
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:20,801
I just saw him. What?

171
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:22,503
Barry's not here. Let's go.

172
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:23,807
He's in the bathroom.

173
00:06:24,183 --> 00:06:25,451
No, he's not.

174
00:06:25,451 --> 00:06:26,119
Can we just go, please?

175
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:27,587
What did you say?

176
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:28,576
Daphne's expecting me.

177
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:30,089
Let's go.

178
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:31,579
 Come again? Oh, for God's sake..

179
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:32,580
(music stops)

180
00:06:33,092 --> 00:06:35,083
I'm begging you, please take me home!

181
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:47,507
You see, actually, he and I are...

182
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:49,498
(music begins)

183
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:04,991
You can rationalize your actions

184
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:06,925
all you want to, kevin. The truth is,

185
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:08,895
you're just not being honest, are you?

186
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:10,696
I guess I'm not.

187
00:07:10,696 --> 00:07:12,198
But it's not like you're so honest

188
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:14,200
about everything in your life.

189
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,601
I beg your pardon.

190
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:19,594
Well, you've never told
your audience you're gay.

191
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:22,765
Excuse me?

192
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:26,579
I saw you in a gay bar last night.

193
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:30,016
Oh. Oh, I see.

194
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:32,618
(chuckling); Yes, in fact,

195
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:35,888
I did pop into Bad Billy'? yesterday.

196
00:07:35,888 --> 00:07:38,024
You see, I thought

197
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:41,093
I had seen a gentleman I wished
to speak with go in there,

198
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:43,095
and I'd certainly never
been in that bar before.

199
00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:45,461
Then how come you knew
the bartender by name?

200
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:48,601
And why were you wearing
those tight little shorts?

201
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:50,102
Well, they...

202
00:07:50,102 --> 00:07:52,104
They were not my shorts.

203
00:07:52,104 --> 00:07:54,607
You see, I'd been playing squash,

204
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:57,076
and I borrowed them from my...

205
00:07:57,076 --> 00:07:59,946
uh, from my friend who is slim-hipped.

206
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:03,177
Yeah, kind of like that
nervous guy you picked up.

207
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,139
Look, I did not pick anybody up.

208
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:07,643
All right, I am going to
put an end to this discussion

209
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,622
because there is nothing to discuss.

210
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:14,126
On my way home from the gym,
I popped into Bad Billy's

211
00:08:14,126 --> 00:08:18,529
Iooking for a man I was
hoping was in the bathroom.

212
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:22,768
I had a quick sherry
with my French polisher,

213
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:24,770
and then I left.

214
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:27,273
As to how I got into
another man's shorts,

215
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:28,262
that is no one's business.

216
00:08:31,043 --> 00:08:32,635
And we're off the air.

217
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:34,134
Oh, dear God.

218
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:39,640
That man you thought you
saw going into Bad Billy's--

219
00:08:40,152 --> 00:08:41,153
that wouldn't be Barry, would it?

220
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:43,155
All right, Roz.

221
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:44,156
I-I saw him on the
street, and I turned,

222
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:46,158
and the next thing I knew, he was gone.

223
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:47,147
You know what Barry was doing

224
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,161
from 1 0:00 until midnight last night?

225
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:50,651
Me, that's what!

226
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:54,656
He's not gay, whereas you, Miss Marple,

227
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:56,168
you've just been outed.

228
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:57,670
Outed?

229
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:01,173
Frasier.

230
00:09:01,173 --> 00:09:02,162
I am so sorry.

231
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:04,165
I thought that last call was appalling.

232
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:05,166
Thank you, Gil.

233
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:07,179
You poor man.

234
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:10,671
How long you must have dreaded
this dark yet inevitable day.

235
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:14,587
I so wish you could have
been allowed to come out

236
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:16,589
in a time and manner
of your own choosing

237
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:19,091
instead of being
wrenched from your closet,

238
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:21,582
your voice cracking, your
cheeks crimson with shame.

239
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:24,564
Gil, I am not gay.

240
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,065
Oh, Frasier, you can't play coy

241
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:29,068
once you've been caught
traipsing around Bad Billy's

242
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:31,070
in shorts that left
little to the imagination.

243
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,572
They were not my shorts.

244
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:35,074
I simply borrowed them
because my own had split

245
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:36,576
when I bent over...

246
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,578
Oh, please!

247
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:41,080
We don't need to know everything.

248
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,082
I just want to say that your kACL family

249
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,584
will be here for you

250
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,074
as you take your first brave steps

251
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:47,587
on that yellow brick road

252
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,589
to pride and self
- acceptance and...

253
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:52,080
Oh, shut up, you big queen!

254
00:09:55,294 --> 00:09:58,263
I see kitty has claws.

255
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:05,738
Another latte to go, please.

256
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:07,239
And you can take it
out of there, thank you.

257
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:08,741
 I-I didn't order these

258
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:11,232
They're from those guys over there.

259
00:10:16,248 --> 00:10:18,739
Oh, Dad. You care for a coffee ?

260
00:10:19,251 --> 00:10:20,753
Nah. I can see where you might think

261
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:21,754
I would, though.

262
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:23,756
A guy walks into a coffee bar,

263
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:25,747
he can't blame people for
thinking he likes coffee.

264
00:10:26,258 --> 00:10:27,760
Yes, Dad.

265
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,762
Course, uh, if he didn't like it,

266
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:31,263
he could make that clear to people.

267
00:10:31,263 --> 00:10:34,266
He might say, "I am
not a coffee drinker"

268
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:36,769
or "I have never

269
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:38,771
tried coffee even once. "

270
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:40,272
Yes, all right, Dad.

271
00:10:40,272 --> 00:10:42,775
"I am not even curious about... "

272
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:45,266
Yes, all right!

273
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:47,268
Thank you.

274
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:53,786
Frasier.

275
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:54,787
I see you caught my show.

276
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:56,288
Mm-hmm.

277
00:10:56,288 --> 00:10:57,289
Go ahead. Let's hear it.

278
00:10:57,289 --> 00:10:59,792
I'm not going to tease
you. I'm grateful.

279
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:01,260
You could have ratted me out to Daphne,

280
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,262
but instead, you protected me...

281
00:11:03,262 --> 00:11:05,753
just like a big sister should.

282
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:10,759
You know, I'm glad this tickles you.

283
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:12,772
I shouldn't make fun.

284
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:15,274
You people have been
persecuted long enough as it is.

285
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:16,263
Are you done?

286
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:18,778
I'm done. I'll return those
shorts to you tomorrow.

287
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:21,269
No, keep them. You'll
want them for the parade.

288
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:23,783
I'm done. Now I'm done.

289
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:25,785
Frasier.

290
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:29,288
Oh, Alistair. so sorry to
hear about your ordeal today.

291
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:31,290
Oh, boy... You heard my show then?

292
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:32,279
No, I heard the replay

293
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:35,283
on kiki and Mel's Drivetime Circus.

294
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:38,798
If it's any comfort,

295
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:41,300
I went through the
same thing myself once.

296
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,803
Really? Yes, I was a
guest on a call-in show,

297
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:46,305
and an angry ex-boyfriend phoned in.

298
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:50,309
Everything came out;
names, dates, birthmarks.

299
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:53,813
Had quite a chat with
the wife that night.

300
00:11:53,813 --> 00:11:55,314
Very frank.

301
00:11:55,314 --> 00:11:56,303
Very expensive. Oh.

302
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:58,716
How awful for you. Of
course, in my case...

303
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:01,721
I know what might rally your spirits.

304
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:02,710
I'm giving a small party

305
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:05,224
after the premiere
of my opera next week.

306
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,225
Are you free to come?

307
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,227
I'd be delighted.

308
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:09,228
splendid.

309
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:11,230
Well, I must get to rehearsals.

310
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,732
Oh, how are things coming?

311
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:13,721
You can tag along,

312
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,001
see for yourself if you like.

313
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:17,737
FRAsIER; I would love that.

314
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,739
Let me just grab my coffee.

315
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:20,728
Good-bye, Dad.

316
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:21,734
Niles.

317
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,749
Did you see that?

318
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:32,051
I would kill to go to that party.

319
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:34,019
I was at that gay bar too, you know.

320
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:39,024
Let's see...

321
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:41,427
One of my sons just
got picked up by a guy.

322
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,418
My other son is jealous.

323
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,422
Yep, life is good.

324
00:12:51,203 --> 00:12:54,206
Dad, please clean up that
debris around your chair.

325
00:12:54,206 --> 00:12:55,207
Alistair is coming by.

326
00:12:55,207 --> 00:12:57,903
"Oh, Alistair. "

327
00:12:58,210 --> 00:12:59,905
That's all we've heard
around here all week.

328
00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:02,214
Alistair this, Alistair that.

329
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:03,983
m DAPHNE; You can't blame hi

330
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:05,084
for being excited.

331
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:06,786
It's fun having a famous friend.

332
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:09,522
When I lived in England...

333
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:11,056
Do you know the actor Peter O' Toole?

334
00:13:11,056 --> 00:13:12,558
sure.

335
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:15,561
I always thought it would be
fun to be friends with him.

336
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:18,063
(doorbell rings)

337
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:20,065
Now, that's him.

338
00:13:20,065 --> 00:13:22,056
Everyone just act natural.

339
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:25,059
Frasier! Alistair!

340
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:29,975
ALIsTAIR; You smell fantastic.

341
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:30,976
Oh, it must be my new conditioner.

342
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:33,979
sandalwood with just a hint of...?

343
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:34,980
Cloves.

344
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,515
The man's amazing.

345
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:38,484
He has the musical panache
of Leonard Bernstein

346
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:42,488
and the nose of a Tuscan truffle hog.

347
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:43,989
You turn my head, sir.

348
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:45,854
(laughing); Oh, well...
come and meet my father,

349
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:47,293
Martin Crane.

350
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:48,994
Well, how lovely to meet you, Martin.

351
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:49,929
How are you?

352
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:50,963
Niles. Hello.

353
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:51,964
Love the tie.

354
00:13:51,964 --> 00:13:52,965
Charvet.

355
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:56,068
And I'm Daphne , Niles' wife.

356
00:13:56,068 --> 00:13:58,559
No.

357
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:01,473
We're expecting.

358
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:04,844
Can't say I was.

359
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:06,209
How lovely to meet you, Daphne.

360
00:14:06,912 --> 00:14:07,913
Likewise.

361
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:10,216
Frasier, this apartment is stunning.

362
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:11,205
Thank you.
The view--

363
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:12,918
breathtaking.

364
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:14,220
The art--
perfect.

365
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,916
The chair--
hilarious.

366
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:21,193
(phone rings) Damn. so sorry.

367
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:22,888
I have to take this call.

368
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:24,059
Hello?

369
00:14:24,463 --> 00:14:26,966
Placido!

370
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:27,967
Placido Domingo?!

371
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:28,956
Yes.

372
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:31,527
I'm here with Frasier.

373
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:34,531
Yes, he's the one I told you about.

374
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:36,464
Oh, stop.

375
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:39,502
Oh, oh, yes, uh... in the kitchen

376
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:42,448
Well, you'll meet him next
month at the concert in Madrid.

377
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:45,940
Oops, now I've spoiled the surprise.

378
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,921
He's taking me to Madrid!

379
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:57,259
You just met him last
week. What's going on?

380
00:14:57,496 --> 00:14:58,053
He kissed you.

381
00:14:58,497 --> 00:14:59,999
Well, he's a man of the theater.

382
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:01,500
He kisses everyone.

383
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,002
It's not like he's the first
gay friend I've ever had.

384
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:05,027
It's the first one who
thinks you're gay, too.

385
00:15:06,972 --> 00:15:08,340
gay. He does not think I'm

386
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:12,003
He thinks I'm gay, and I'm
standing next to my pregnant wife.

387
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:16,515
Have you told him you're straight?

388
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:20,085
I don't have to. I mean, it's obvious.

389
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:22,588
We are just friends.
He is not courting me.

390
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,089
Is that a new watch?

391
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:26,023
so what if it is?

392
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:31,130
Jewelry. Ooh, he's a keeper.

393
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:33,999
stop that!

394
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:35,000
My friendship with Alistair

395
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,502
is the best thing that's
happened to me in months.

396
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:38,003
I will not have you sully it

397
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:39,071
by making it out to
be something it's not.

398
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:40,698
sorry, my angel.

399
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,311
Well, we'd best get to that tailor.

400
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:46,312
Oh, yes, yes.

401
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:48,013
We're having new tuxes made

402
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:50,015
for Alistair's premiere
part y this weekend.

403
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,583
To which you are all invited.

404
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:52,675
(gasps) ; Thank you.

405
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,622
Will Peter O'Toole be there?

406
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,613
No... and he knows why.

407
00:16:01,193 --> 00:16:03,195
These are amazing.
Where did you get them?

408
00:16:03,195 --> 00:16:04,196
I made them myself.

409
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:05,698
No...

410
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:08,200
Is there anything this man can't do?

411
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,566
Time will tell.

412
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:27,553
Look at this crowd.

413
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:29,054
It's like a Who's Who

414
00:16:29,054 --> 00:16:33,058
of the creme de la
creme of the upper crust!

415
00:16:33,058 --> 00:16:35,060
Frasier. Alistair.

416
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:37,563
Your production was a triumph!

417
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:38,564
Wasn't it?

418
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:40,054
smile.

419
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:44,570
Welcome, welcome. Thank you.

420
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,071
There are so many people here

421
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:47,573
I'm dying for you to meet,

422
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:49,074
but I have to make a
little announcement first.

423
00:16:49,074 --> 00:16:52,578
Glinka, darling, come and meet Frasier.

424
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:54,580
Frasier, finally.

425
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,582
Oh, Glinka, it's such
an honor to meet you.

426
00:16:56,582 --> 00:16:59,084
I have all your recordings.

427
00:16:59,084 --> 00:17:02,087
so, I hear that you and
Alistair are quite an item.

428
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:04,078
Oh, no, no, no, we're
just very good friends.

429
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:06,581
Oh, yes. Yes, of course.

430
00:17:07,092 --> 00:17:08,093
Everyone,

431
00:17:08,093 --> 00:17:10,596
? . could I have your attention, please

432
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:14,099
I have to announce that
our very own Nigel Fry

433
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:16,158
is retiring and giving up his seat

434
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:18,070
on the Opera board...

435
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:19,071
(all sigh sadly)

436
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:22,241
...but I am thrilled
to name as his successor

437
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:25,244
a tireless supporter
of opera in seattle,

438
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:27,178
Dr. Frasier Crane.

439
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:31,316
Oh! Oh, my! Oh, I never dreamed...

440
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:33,318
Oh, thank you, thank you!

441
00:17:33,318 --> 00:17:35,309
Congratu... Iations.

442
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:37,823
stunning couple, aren't they?

443
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:41,122
I'm more stunned by them each day.

444
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:44,463
Oh, Daph. Quite an honor.

445
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:46,165
Oh, my God! Isn't it thrilling?

446
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:47,332
Frasier, can we talk to
you for a moment? Yes.

447
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:49,300
Do you realize that
every person in this room

448
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:51,804
thinks that you're Alistair's boyfriend?

449
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:53,795
 Listen, I can't help it if
people think we're a couple

450
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:55,808
The point is I'm enjoying myself,

451
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:56,797
and if you're too jealous
to be happy for me,

452
00:17:57,309 --> 00:17:58,310
then that's your problem.

453
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:59,311
Jealous?!

454
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:00,813
Yes, that's right.

455
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:02,714
All my life I have dreamed

456
00:18:02,714 --> 00:18:04,204
of being half of a power couple,

457
00:18:04,716 --> 00:18:06,707
and I finally am.

458
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,723
Is it perfect? No.

459
00:18:11,723 --> 00:18:14,226
. But it's fun, and
I don't want it to end

460
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:15,727
Don't you worry at all

461
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:17,729
that Alistair might be falling for you?

462
00:18:17,729 --> 00:18:19,720
Oh, please. The man has
not even made a move on me,

463
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:21,233
and do you know why?

464
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:23,735
Because we are friends.

465
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:26,238
Famous, fabulous friends.

466
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:27,739
Oh, uh, Alistair.

467
00:18:27,739 --> 00:18:28,740
Congratulations.

468
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,242
It was a stunning production.

469
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:31,743
Oh, thank you, Niles.

470
00:18:31,743 --> 00:18:33,745
It must be awfully hard
work putting on an opera.

471
00:18:33,745 --> 00:18:35,747
It is utterly draining.

472
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:36,748
In fact, when I'm in rehearsals,

473
00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:39,751
I devote every ounce of strength to it.

474
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:42,254
No exercising, no jogging.

475
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:44,756
I even abstain from sex.

476
00:18:44,756 --> 00:18:47,247
re. Well, you can ask Frasier he

477
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:51,686
My poor, dear, patient Frasier.

478
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,702
Care to dance?

479
00:18:56,702 --> 00:18:58,704
I would love to.

480
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:00,695
Don't go far.

481
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:11,216
Well, looks like Nigel
won't be the only one

482
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:13,207
giving up his seat tonight.

483
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:19,224
I could scratch your eyes out

484
00:19:19,224 --> 00:19:21,715
and not one person here
would find it strange.

485
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:25,720
I'm sorry.

486
00:19:27,232 --> 00:19:30,724
Damn my fatal allure.

487
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:34,740
Alistair... when you're
finish with this dance...

488
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,241
Oh, no.

489
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:37,731
Be my guest.

490
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:45,250
Frasier, do you have any idea

491
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:48,253
how sexy you look in that tux?

492
00:19:48,253 --> 00:19:50,244
Yes, I do.

493
00:19:52,257 --> 00:19:53,258
Alistair...

494
00:19:53,258 --> 00:19:55,260
I'm afraid I may have given you

495
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,762
the wrong impression about myself.

496
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:58,764
You seem nervous. Don't be.

497
00:19:58,764 --> 00:20:01,266
And I want to thank you for waiting.

498
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:03,268
Oh, no, the waiting was
good. I enjoyed the waiting.

499
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:05,771
Oh, me too.

500
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:08,774
How it sharpens the appetite.

501
00:20:08,774 --> 00:20:10,776
How it builds.

502
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:13,779
The intensity, the heat, the desire.

503
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:14,780
Can you feel it?

504
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:17,783
Oh, yes, there it is.

505
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:19,273
Alistair, um...

506
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:23,789
Listen, I-I...

507
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:26,280
I'm afraid I have to
tell you something, uh...

508
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:29,294
I'm not gay.

509
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:30,295
Oh, Frasier, please don't tell me

510
00:20:30,295 --> 00:20:32,297
you're still strugglin
g with those issues.

511
00:20:32,297 --> 00:20:35,801
Well, I-I like you so much,
and I love our friendship.

512
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:38,804
But I'm afraid I can never
really be more than friends.

513
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:40,305
Would three weeks on Capri

514
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:43,297
in Bertolucci's villa change your mind?

515
00:20:51,316 --> 00:20:53,318
It's worth a try.

516
00:20:53,318 --> 00:20:54,808
No, no...

517
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:58,390
No.

518
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:00,692
It-it wouldn't. I'm sorry.

519
00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:02,694
(sighs) ; Well, then...

520
00:21:02,694 --> 00:21:04,696
I'm so sorry.

521
00:21:04,696 --> 00:21:06,391
so am I.

522
00:21:06,698 --> 00:21:08,400
Could I ask a small favor of you?

523
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,668
Of course. Anything.

524
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:11,370
Would you mind staying tonight

525
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:12,671
until my other guests have gone?

526
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:15,674
I'd hate my friends to
think I'd been jilted.

527
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:17,376
Of course.

528
00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:18,677
It won't be very late.

529
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:21,346
Around about 3:00 it's
down to the core crowd,

530
00:21:21,346 --> 00:21:23,348
and we'll all relax and unwind.

531
00:21:23,348 --> 00:21:24,349
It's after midnight, sir.

532
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:25,684
shall I fire up the hot tub?

533
00:21:25,684 --> 00:21:27,686
Absolutely.

534
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:29,381
I'm afraid I don't have a bathing suit.

535
00:21:29,688 --> 00:21:36,355
Then you'll fit right in.
