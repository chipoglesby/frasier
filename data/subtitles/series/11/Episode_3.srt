1
00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:10,310
Does he wear jewelry?

2
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:12,312
'cause I don't do "man jewelry. "

3
00:00:12,312 --> 00:00:14,014
He doesn't wear jewelry.

4
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,016
What about skin issues?

5
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:19,319
Because I have a thing
against tags, growths,

6
00:00:19,319 --> 00:00:21,321
any kind of fleshy masses.

7
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:23,323
Ann, he's male and his heart is beating.

8
00:00:23,323 --> 00:00:25,025
What else do you need to know?

9
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,693
Okay.

10
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:28,128
Frasier.

11
00:00:28,128 --> 00:00:29,429
Roz, I came as quickly as I could.

12
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:30,430
What's the emergency?

13
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:32,125
Oh, no, it's not an
emergency. It's just...

14
00:00:32,432 --> 00:00:33,126
Hi. I'm Ann Hodges .

15
00:00:33,433 --> 00:00:35,424
I'm divorced.

16
00:00:36,136 --> 00:00:38,438
I'm sorry. I'm Dr. Frasier crane.

17
00:00:38,438 --> 00:00:40,440
I thought you two would like to meet.

18
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,441
Ann is in insurance.

19
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:43,143
Oh, well, I'm sorry she dragged you

20
00:00:43,143 --> 00:00:44,144
all the way down here.

21
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:45,445
I've just renewed my policy.

22
00:00:45,445 --> 00:00:47,447
Perhaps Roz could introduce
you to my brother Niles.

23
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:48,448
Is he single?

24
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:49,449
No, but with a baby on the way,

25
00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:51,151
he might need some additional coverage.

26
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:52,152
Super.

27
00:00:52,152 --> 00:00:53,449
Well, thanks a lot, Roz.

28
00:00:54,154 --> 00:00:56,145
This was totally worth
a drive across town.

29
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:02,128
Are you dense? I was
trying to set you guys up.

30
00:01:02,128 --> 00:01:03,117
Why would you do that?

31
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:04,631
I don't know.

32
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:06,633
Maybe because you
haven't had a date in ages

33
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:08,134
and it's starting to show.

34
00:01:08,134 --> 00:01:09,636
What is that, your purse?

35
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:12,127
This is a grocery tote.

36
00:01:12,639 --> 00:01:13,640
I wanted to pick up some vegetables

37
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,629
and some cat food at the market.

38
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:16,540
You did not get a cat.

39
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:18,540
No, no, I am cat-sitting
for a neighbor.

40
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:20,246
And I go out. I'm
going out this evening .

41
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:21,247
With whom?

42
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:22,248
People.

43
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:24,239
People you're related to?

44
00:01:24,551 --> 00:01:26,252
They're still people.

45
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:28,254
Listen, Roz, I may not
go out as often as you do,

46
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:29,243
but that's because I have standards.

47
00:01:29,556 --> 00:01:31,558
Haven't you ever heard
of waiting for Miss Right?

48
00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:33,593
Yeah, well, Miss Right
has standards, too,

49
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:35,562
and she's not looking
to meet Mr. Mothballs.

50
00:01:35,562 --> 00:01:38,565
You can smell that ? Oh, dear.

51
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:40,266
You need a place holder.

52
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:42,268
You know, someone you can go out with

53
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:44,270
and just keep your dating muscles toned.

54
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:47,273
That way you'll be ready
when Miss Right comes along.

55
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:49,275
And Ann Hodges is a born place holder.

56
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:51,578
I don't want to go out with
somebody I'm not interested in .

57
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:53,279
I would rather wait for Miss Right.

58
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:54,581
And while I'm waiting,

59
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:56,749
there's no reason I can't
li a rich and rewarding life.

60
00:01:56,749 --> 00:01:58,318
Now, if you'll excuse me,

61
00:01:58,318 --> 00:02:00,820
I need to get these vegetables home

62
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,310
and into a hearty winter soup.

63
00:02:02,822 --> 00:02:03,323
Oh, hi, guys.

64
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:05,325
Hey, Doc, you're always free.

65
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:06,826
My cousin's in town.

66
00:02:06,826 --> 00:02:07,815
Why don't you help me show her the city?

67
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:09,262
Did Roz put you up to this?

68
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:11,297
I had nothing to do
with it. I swear to God.

69
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:12,799
Well, I'm sorry, Kenny,

70
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,801
but I am booked all this weekend.

71
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,302
Oh, here's luck.

72
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:18,304
I found a perfectly good
thimble in this pocket.

73
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:19,305
See you later.

74
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:21,307
Thanks anyway.

75
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:22,296
Hey, I tried.

76
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:30,683
NILES; Reservation for crane.

77
00:02:30,683 --> 00:02:32,352
For four, sir?

78
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:34,654
No, sorry, for five. We added one.

79
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:36,645
All we have is a table for four.

80
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:38,358
We can all squeeze.

81
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:39,659
This one's always on my lap

82
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,661
after the second drink anyway.

83
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:43,652
very well, madam.

84
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:46,355
get the chair.

85
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:51,371
You know, there's really no
need to go to all this trouble.

86
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:54,374
I have a perfectly good
winter soup back home.

87
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:55,375
Don't be silly. Oh, no.

88
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:57,377
All right, um...

89
00:02:57,377 --> 00:02:58,678
Well, um...

90
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:00,373
Oh!

91
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,384
I'm sorry. Do you have anything higher?

92
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:08,377
Sorry, sir. I will look for a cushion.

93
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:11,391
So, Fras,

94
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:14,394
tell everybody about that new
antique you picked up today.

95
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:16,696
Well, it's a late Regency
fruitwood mirror.

96
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:20,393
very valuable if it has the
original glass, which mine does.

97
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,394
No. What are the odds?

98
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:22,702
Boy, if you like mirrors

99
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,693
you should see the one Ronee's
got in her dressing room.

100
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:27,407
It's got lights all around the edges,

101
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:29,671
and it has three settings.

102
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,378
Yeah. Daytime, nighttime, and yikes.

103
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:33,379
(laughing)

104
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:34,681
Oh, yes, excuse me.

105
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:38,384
If I could get a place
setting, that would be lovely.

106
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:40,386
What's Inizio Due cuore?

107
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:42,388
That's our appetizer sampler for two.

108
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:43,389
A bruschetta for you,

109
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:45,391
a bruschetta for your love and so on.

110
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:46,688
Is it possible to make that for one?

111
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:50,964
One?

112
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:53,399
Yes, a bruschetta for me,

113
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:56,459
no bruschetta for my love and so on.

114
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:57,770
I'm sorry. It's dueor no.

115
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:59,772
 NILES; That's fine.

116
00:03:59,772 --> 00:04:01,274
We'll get two orders
and we'll just all share.

117
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:02,764
very good.

118
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:07,280
Mm, looks delicious.

119
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,281
This is fun, you know.

120
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:09,782
This is the first time

121
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:11,272
Marty and I have been
out with another couple.

122
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:14,621
And... Frasier.

123
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:16,322
It's fun being out with Frasier, too.

124
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:17,624
(all agreeing)

125
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:19,325
We love being out with
Frasier, don't we, Niles.

126
00:04:19,325 --> 00:04:21,361
All right, listen, all
of you, just knock it off.

127
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:22,629
Welcome, everyone.

128
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:25,331
42 years ago tonight,

129
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:27,634
I married my beautiful Theresa.

130
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:29,534
And now, we hope

131
00:04:29,902 --> 00:04:32,505
that all you loving couples out there

132
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:35,508
will help us celebrate our happiness

133
00:04:35,508 --> 00:04:37,999
by joining us in a dance.

134
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:51,447
 The fish..

135
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:53,717
Oh, just go dance .

136
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:19,018
Hello...

137
00:05:19,018 --> 00:05:21,020
Mr. Bottomsley.

138
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:25,525
Dinner was an absolute nightmare.

139
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:29,028
Fortunately, I was able
to slip out of there early

140
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:31,531
and pick you up a little treat.

141
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:32,532
(chuckles)

142
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:33,533
Fresh tuna.

143
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:36,434
. You're welcome

144
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:38,071
(over answering machine)
; Frasier, this is Roz.

145
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:39,972
Write down this number.

146
00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:40,973
555-01 79.

147
00:05:40,973 --> 00:05:44,477
Don't get mad, but that's Ann's number.

148
00:05:44,477 --> 00:05:45,978
I talked to her and she really thought

149
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:47,947
you were cute and sweet and...

150
00:05:47,947 --> 00:05:49,949
Honestly, why does everyone assume

151
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:52,385
that I need some
companionship in my life?

152
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:55,877
Has the world gone mad, Mr. Bottomsley?

153
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:04,130
What shall we two bachelor
s do this evening, Mr. B?

154
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:06,599
 Perhaps a crossword puzzle?

155
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:08,089
Maybe watch a little telly?

156
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:09,602
Oh, I
know--

157
00:06:09,602 --> 00:06:11,437
how about a nice hot bath?

158
00:06:11,437 --> 00:06:12,939
(chuckles)

159
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:15,430
I'm just teasing.

160
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:19,645
, Now, I know that you're
used to eating canned tuna

161
00:06:19,645 --> 00:06:21,147
so this will taste different,

162
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:23,983
but if you're like me,
I think you'll agree

163
00:06:23,983 --> 00:06:25,485
it's much better.

164
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:28,488
If only there were a treat here for me.

165
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:29,989
(gasps)

166
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:32,492
What's this?

167
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:35,495
A delicious nine-vegetable winter soup.

168
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:36,996
Oh...

169
00:06:36,996 --> 00:06:38,498
(sniffs)

170
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:40,566
Yes, Mr. B, I think you were right

171
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:41,555
about the bay leaves.

172
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:49,475
(with British accent); Oh, Mr.
Bottomsley, lovely to see you again, sir.

173
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:51,978
Your customary table, I presume, hmm?

174
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:54,480
Splendid.

175
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,482
Here you go.

176
00:06:56,482 --> 00:06:57,550
(sighs)

177
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:00,485
come on, buddy.

178
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:02,188
Well, isn't this civilized?

179
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:04,179
Beat it, Eddie. There's none for you.

180
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:09,195
Do you feel a draft, Mr. B?

181
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:11,186
I'm just a little bit cold.

182
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:13,187
There we are.

183
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:17,192
That's better.

184
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:22,241
Ooh, that's still a little too hot.

185
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:26,212
You know what? While
we're letting that cool,

186
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:31,117
why don't we find a
home for our antique.

187
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:33,119
There we are. Yes.

188
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:36,622
You know, you don't find
one of these very easily.

189
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:39,125
Especially in such good condition.

190
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:42,128
Won't that covetous Niles
be m when he sees it, hmm?

191
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,618
But he can't have it, can he?

192
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,131
No.

193
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,133
Yes, he can't have it,

194
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:48,634
can he?

195
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:50,124
No, no...

196
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:53,995
Dear God, I'm Aunt Shirley .

197
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:57,510
(cat shrieks)

198
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,501
get that number.

199
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:11,591
Mrs. gablyczyck... these new shirts,

200
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:13,593
did Mrs. crane ask
you to buy them for me?

201
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:15,595
Because I already have
shirts just like these.

202
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:18,898
No, no, after I wash, I pin them

203
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:20,889
and wrap in plastic.

204
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:24,904
You not like?

205
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:26,606
No, no...

206
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:28,908
(voice breaking); I like very much.

207
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:30,910
Thank you, mister.

208
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:31,911
(doorbell ringing)

209
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:32,912
Oh...

210
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:34,607
No, I'll get it.

211
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:40,620
Hey, Dad, come on in. Hi.

212
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,611
Daphne will be right down and we can go.

213
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:43,616
Where's Frasier?

214
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:44,924
On a date.

215
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:46,926
get out!

216
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:48,928
About time, huh?

217
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:51,631
You know, it's like I
was saying to Eddie--

218
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:53,633
this guy's got to get a life.

219
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:55,701
DAPHNE; Niles, I left $60

220
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:57,203
on the desk yesterday

221
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,704
and now it's gone.

222
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:00,206
Is that proof enough for you?

223
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,207
Are you sure you didn't misplace it?

224
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,208
You know I didn't.

225
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,676
What's going on?

226
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:05,177
Ever since we hired Mrs. gablyczyck

227
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:06,166
things have been
disappearing--

228
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:08,169
liquor, money, linens.

229
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:09,749
So she's stealing from you.

230
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:11,284
Yes. We don't know that.

231
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:12,273
And frankly, it's hard to believe

232
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:13,774
that someone who'll
go out in a rainstorm

233
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:15,288
to clean pigeon muck
from the solarium skylight

234
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:17,790
is capable of theft.

235
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:18,791
We can't put up with stealing

236
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:20,793
just because she's
good at what she does.

237
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:22,283
First of all, she's not
good at what she does.

238
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:23,693
She's brilliant.

239
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:29,101
She's an artist.

240
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:31,137
Tell you what-- you give
me five minutes with her.

241
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:33,639
If she's hiding anything,
I'll get it out of her.

242
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:36,642
Dad, we are not going to coerce
a confession out of this woman

243
00:09:36,642 --> 00:09:38,144
based on circumstantial evidence.

244
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:40,146
(bell dings)

245
00:09:40,146 --> 00:09:41,647
Oven is clean.

246
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:44,650
Now I scrub down dishwasher.

247
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:47,642
Oh, Mrs. gablyczyck, you
dropped some... money.

248
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:52,147
Thank you, mister.

249
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:56,651
All right, Dad, you've got five minutes.

250
00:09:59,832 --> 00:10:04,667
FRASIER; We'd like your famous
appetizer for two, please.

251
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:06,606
I'll let your waiter know.

252
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:07,907
Thank you very much.

253
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:09,609
So, Ann...

254
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:10,910
tell me everything.

255
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:14,347
Who is Ann Hodges?

256
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:19,352
Wow. Well, I'm an
insurance claims adjuster.

257
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:20,853
That's what' s so funny.

258
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:22,343
When we met, you thought I was in sales,

259
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:23,856
 but I'm not.

260
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:24,857
Oh.

261
00:10:24,857 --> 00:10:26,859
I'm in claims.

262
00:10:26,859 --> 00:10:31,364
Well, you know, we don't
have to have just shop talk.

263
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:33,332
What are your dreams?

264
00:10:33,332 --> 00:10:35,368
Oh, my God.

265
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:41,874
Well, my dream is to be
aseniorclaims adjuster.

266
00:10:41,874 --> 00:10:43,876
It's sort of the same,

267
00:10:43,876 --> 00:10:46,879
but you get a private cube
and your own extension.

268
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:48,381
 I would've got it last year

269
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:50,883
but I paid a big claim
the company didn't like.

270
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:52,885
I knew I goofed the second I did it.

271
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:55,888
It was just one of those
"Shoot!" moments, you know,

272
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:57,390
when you just say "Shoot!"

273
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,725
Do you ever do that,

274
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:02,728
make a big mistake and
want to go back in time

275
00:11:02,728 --> 00:11:05,219
and just do something different?

276
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:09,724
Oh, yes.

277
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:11,737
Well, I'm going to run
to the ladies' room.

278
00:11:11,737 --> 00:11:13,239
I just had to have that Dr. Pepper

279
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:16,231
while I was getting dressed.

280
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:23,249
good evening, sir. Ah.

281
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:25,351
Would you care for something to
drink? Yes, as a matter of fact,

282
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:26,886
I would-- I'd like,
uh, your finest bottle

283
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:28,387
of Barolo, please.

284
00:11:28,387 --> 00:11:29,889
Why don't you come back in a minute

285
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:30,878
and see what the lady likes.

286
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:36,395
Doc? Hm?

287
00:11:36,395 --> 00:11:37,897
Hey, small world! Oh, Kenny, hi.

288
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:40,399
This is my cousin I
was telling you about.

289
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,401
This is Dr. crane. Oh.

290
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:44,130
e, Hello. Dr. c ran

291
00:11:44,403 --> 00:11:46,439
I heard your show
today-- it was great.

292
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:47,940
(chuckles); Well...

293
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,430
Is this your, uh, first time in Seattle?

294
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:51,501
Yes, it is-- I'm
a fine arts dealer,

295
00:11:51,944 --> 00:11:55,147
but I'm considering a curator
position at the Seattle Art Museum.

296
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:56,849
That's impressive.
KENNY:Oh, that's nothing.

297
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:58,150
She teaches kids ballet,

298
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:00,853
and she rock climbs, she plays the harp.

299
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:02,755
Oh, what am I doing? I
haven't introduced you.

300
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:03,823
Dr. Frasier crane,

301
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:05,848
Liz Wright.

302
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:12,364
It's lovely to meet you. .. Miss Wright.

303
00:12:12,364 --> 00:12:13,866
(chuckles)

304
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:15,801
Well, it's too bad
you're not free tonight.

305
00:12:15,801 --> 00:12:17,303
 You could've joined us.

306
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:18,793
Well, how about tomorrow night?

307
00:12:19,171 --> 00:12:21,230
Oh, I'd love to, but I'm on
a plane tonight to Amsterdam.

308
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:22,908
I have a job offer there as well.

309
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:25,211
I'm doing my best to
convince her to pick Seattle,

310
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:27,913
but it's tough when you're
up against the Dutch.

311
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:29,107
Ah.

312
00:12:29,448 --> 00:12:31,016
I could've really used
your help there, Doc.

313
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:33,052
 Yes, well, you know, I'm
just about finished up here.

314
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:34,754
You know, we wouldn't want
to interrupt your date.

315
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:35,755
Oh, it's not a date. It's not a date.

316
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,757
It's just a little business thing.

317
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:40,059
 I'll tell you what,
I'll just wrap things up here

318
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:43,051
and then I'll come and help
yo wage the battle for Seattle.

319
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:44,764
(laughs) ; Okay.

320
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:47,062
That's great. We'll see you soon.

321
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:51,771
Man, oh, man, that place was a madhouse.

322
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:54,763
I got so tired of waiting,
I just decided to hold it.

323
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:00,075
I'm so glad yo u picked Italian.

324
00:13:00,846 --> 00:13:02,782
I love macaroni.

325
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,083
Ah.

326
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:06,786
That's another thing w e
have in common, I guess.

327
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:07,787
(chuckles) ; Well...

328
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,778
Uh, you know, Ann, uh,
first dates are funny.

329
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:12,785
Uh, sometimes it takes a
while for two people to click.

330
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:14,787
Sometimes you know right away, and, uh,

331
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:17,085
I think when you do, you
should just feel free...

332
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,799
You are so cute. c lick.

333
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,100
(laughing)

334
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,101
What?

335
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:23,090
click,
click--

336
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,805
the sound of us clicking.

337
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,807
Ann, um...

338
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,109
You don't know what a relief this is.

339
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:32,111
I've only had one date since my divorce.

340
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:34,814
Well, half a date.

341
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:37,116
The jerk actually called
it off in the middle of dinner.

342
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:38,818
I was a wreck.

343
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,820
I didn't get out of bed for a week.

344
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,811
Or shave my legs.

345
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:46,125
Your appetizers. Oh.

346
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:48,828
gosh, this is a feast.

347
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:51,831
I'm not sure we'll need
to order a main course.

348
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,833
Well, this ain't gonna do it forme.

349
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:54,822
 I'm starvin' like Marvin.

350
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:01,872
Mrs. gablyczyck, we're friends here.

351
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:05,211
No one wants to send you to
jail or back to your country.

352
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:08,848
We just need you to admit
that you took the money.

353
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,149
I no take nothing.

354
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:11,851
Do you want to go to jail?!

355
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,148
Do you want to go back to your country?!

356
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:17,056
Well, I was hoping it
wouldn't come to this,

357
00:14:17,056 --> 00:14:19,558
but I'm afraid we're going
to have to show her the tape.

358
00:14:19,558 --> 00:14:20,559
What tape?

359
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:22,561
It's from the surveillance camera.

360
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:24,563
It shows you stealing.

361
00:14:24,563 --> 00:14:26,030
(whispers) ; You have a camera?

362
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:27,032
DAPHNE; You might as well confess.

363
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:28,534
I've got the evidence.

364
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,525
I want to see tape.

365
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:34,528
All right.

366
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,544
I'll give you one last chance

367
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,535
to tell the truth, Mrs. gablyczyck,

368
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:42,548
because if we watch this tape,

369
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:45,551
we'll have no choice
but to call the police.

370
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,052
I see tape.

371
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:48,542
All right.

372
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:50,556
I'm putting the tape in.

373
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:53,548
Here I go.

374
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,551
I'm pressing play.

375
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:03,569
Now I'm switching the
input from cable to video.

376
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,560
Niles, get ready to call the police.

377
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:08,562
?? .. (people singing on tape)
; ??... birthday, dear Dad...

378
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:10,075
 Hey, that's me!

379
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,076
Yes,

380
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:13,067
I used an old tape of
your birthday party,

381
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,080
but the surveillance part's coming up.

382
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,082
Last chance, Mrs. gablyczyck.

383
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:18,417
It's coming up...

384
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:19,518
Okay, I have to step in here...

385
00:15:19,518 --> 00:15:21,008
All right, all right!

386
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,022
I stole.

387
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:24,023
You did?

388
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:25,513
I didn't think you know.

389
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:27,515
I bring it back.

390
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:29,426
(sighs)

391
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,920
Well done, Daphne.

392
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,934
Oh, but I'm so disappointed.

393
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:38,437
I was really hoping you were wrong.

394
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:39,939
Hey, hey, did you see that?

395
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:40,940
Watch this again.

396
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,442
What?

397
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:44,944
You must have put the camera down

398
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,313
when we went into the
kitchen for ice cream.

399
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:49,281
Watch Daphne's mother.

400
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:52,216
My mother? She stayed
behind to grab her sweater.

401
00:15:52,651 --> 00:15:55,087
And our candlesticks.

402
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:57,578
And our
20-year-old scotch.

403
00:15:58,057 --> 00:16:01,126
This is plate I brought home.

404
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:03,028
so I take Mrs. crane'

405
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:05,030
leftover meat pie.

406
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:07,333
But I brought plate back.

407
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:10,035
Mrs. gablyczyck... we're so sorry.

408
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:12,026
We've made a terrible mistake.

409
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:15,341
We know now you didn't steal anything.

410
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:17,343
can you ever forgive us?

411
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:19,038
Of course, mister.

412
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:22,047
You're nice man.

413
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:24,038
And you're nice lady.

414
00:16:32,257 --> 00:16:34,326
Are you sure that' s all the
little bunny wants to eat,

415
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:37,022
just a little green salad?

416
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:41,322
The bunny had a big Mexican lunch.

417
00:16:44,036 --> 00:16:45,025
You know, if you're feeling full,

418
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:47,339
then I'm sure they could wrap
up the rest of that for you.

419
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,341
Oh, no, I'm just trying to pace myself

420
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:51,043
so I'll have room for dessert.

421
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:55,036
I hear the souffl here
is well worth the wait.

422
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:01,520
Excuse me. I'd better get that.

423
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,022
That didn't even ring.

424
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:05,013
. Yes, it did. Hello? Oh

425
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,515
Niles?

426
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,528
Is there something wrong?

427
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:11,030
Oh, dear God, well,

428
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,032
you-you just stay there on the floor.

429
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,033
I'll be right there.

430
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,035
I'm so sorry. Uh...

431
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,024
Is everything all right?

432
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:18,525
Well, uh, actually, it's my brother.

433
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,039
He's thrown out his back again.

434
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:23,542
Oh, God, right in the middle
of our magical evening, too.

435
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:24,543
check, please. Thank you.

436
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,545
Uh, you know...

437
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:28,547
I guess I'm just going to
have to put you in a cab.

438
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:31,050
I'm so sorry-- I was having
such a lovely evening.

439
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,552
Well, maybe we could meet
for coffee tomorrow. Yes,

440
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:35,554
um, all right, all right.

441
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:37,056
Ah, thank you very much.

442
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,058
Uh, yes, here, yeah, that's fine.

443
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,060
You just keep the change. Uh, thank you.

444
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,062
Uh, shall we?

445
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,564
You know, I'm just going
to call a cab later.

446
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:48,055
There's no sense all
this food going to waste.

447
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,273
You know what? I-I can't leave.

448
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:56,575
I can't. It would be rude.

449
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:59,278
Oh, don't be silly. go . No, no.

450
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:01,580
It's... it's not like
he's going anywhere anyway.

451
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,583
(chuckling)

452
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:08,287
Okay. Well, uh, are
you sure you're not hungry?

453
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:10,289
You're welcome to try some of mine.

454
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:11,590
Well, now that you mention it,

455
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,592
uh, I guess I would like to try it.

456
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:14,593
Yes, thank you.

457
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,595
Well, help yourself. Mm-hmm.

458
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:18,290
Okay, well, where were we?

459
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,299
Oh, that's right. My husband.

460
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:21,596
Anyway, he says he doesn't love me

461
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:24,603
He's bored, blah, blah
, he's suffocating.

462
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,594
If only, I say.

463
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:29,608
I would have gotten a
nice little settlement.

464
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:33,312
I mean, we were
covered up the yin-yang.

465
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:35,303
He had a sweet whole-life policy

466
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:38,310
that paid double for accidental death.

467
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:43,315
I borrowed against it to get my Hyundai.

468
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,613
Hey!

469
00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:47,622
Who's the ravioli monster?

470
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:50,625
Roar.

471
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:54,633
You're worried about
your brother, aren't you?

472
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:56,328
Mm. Maybe we should just go.

473
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:57,624
All right.

474
00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:00,639
Once again, I've had
such a lovely evening.

475
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,674
(Ann laughs)

476
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:05,577
I hope I didn't talk your ear off.

477
00:19:05,577 --> 00:19:08,280
I can still hear you, so no.

478
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,282
(chuckles)

479
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:12,284
gosh, you know, uh...

480
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:14,586
I'm parked out back, so I'll
just slip out through the kitchen.

481
00:19:14,586 --> 00:19:16,281
I'm sure the valet can flag you a cab.

482
00:19:16,588 --> 00:19:17,589
Oh.

483
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:20,292
Okay. Well...
here we are--

484
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:22,594
the awkward part.

485
00:19:22,594 --> 00:19:23,595
Oh, it's not awkward at all.

486
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:25,297
I'd be delighted to pay for your cab.

487
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:26,594
Here we are. Bye-bye.

488
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:31,303
(chuckling); I...
I hope I'm not too late

489
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:32,604
You know, I think I talked her

490
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:34,306
into taking that Seattle job.

491
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:35,307
Oh, well,

492
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:36,608
let me be the first to offer

493
00:19:36,608 --> 00:19:38,510
my congratulations... to Seattle.

494
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,379
Thank you.

495
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:41,880
And please let me offer my services

496
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,616
as, uh... cultural attach?.

497
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:46,451
Well, I would love that.

498
00:19:46,451 --> 00:19:48,009
I think this calls for a toast.

499
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:49,943
May I see your list
of champagnes, please?

500
00:19:51,456 --> 00:19:52,457
Ann.

501
00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:53,959
I thought you left our date

502
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:55,449
to go take care of your brother.

503
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:57,462
Date? I-I thought you said

504
00:19:57,462 --> 00:20:00,265
you were just wrapping
up a business meeting.

505
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:03,635
Is that why you ate all my raviolis?

506
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:06,627
Because you were just
trying to get rid of me?

507
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:08,340
No, no, of-of course not.

508
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,342
Listen, there's a perfectly
logical explanation

509
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:12,644
for all this, which is...

510
00:20:12,644 --> 00:20:14,635
I'm sorry. I've-I've got to take that.

511
00:20:16,648 --> 00:20:17,649
Hello?

512
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:18,917
That didn't ring.

513
00:20:18,917 --> 00:20:21,477
It's very soft.

514
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:24,323
FRASIER; Oh, gosh, Dad,

515
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:25,824
that sounds serious.

516
00:20:25,824 --> 00:20:27,815
You stay put. I'll be right there.

517
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:29,817
(phone rings) Ow! That's loud!

518
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:36,924
Oh, Doc, what are you doing?

519
00:20:38,437 --> 00:20:41,429
This is exactly like my other date!

520
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:44,443
Kenny, I think I'd like to get to
the airport a little early tonight.

521
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:45,944
But, Miss Wright...

522
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:46,945
I'll meet you out front.

523
00:20:46,945 --> 00:20:47,946
Excuse me.

524
00:20:47,946 --> 00:20:48,935
But, Liz...

525
00:20:50,449 --> 00:20:54,442
This one hurts, Doc.
I had a souffl? coming.

526
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:01,326
. I'm sorry, Ann

527
00:21:01,326 --> 00:21:03,295
I'm sorry, too.

528
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:05,297
Sorry for thinking you were different

529
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:07,288
than all the other jerks out there.

530
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:08,588
But you're not.

531
00:21:09,301 --> 00:21:12,304
You're just another
selfish, dishonest creep.

532
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:15,607
 You're right. I don't know what to say

533
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:17,609
Well, maybe you can
come up with something

534
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:20,510
before we have coffee tomorrow.

535
00:21:22,514 --> 00:21:24,448
Are you seriously suggesting that...

536
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:26,307
What?!

537
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,621
See you at 1 0:00?

538
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:32,317
Okay.
