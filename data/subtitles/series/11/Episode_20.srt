1
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:10,377
Just the man I want to see.
Coffee, please.

2
00:00:10,377 --> 00:00:12,078
Niles, Niles, please...?

3
00:00:12,078 --> 00:00:13,380
You will not believe
the morning I've had..
.

4
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,382
Would you be terribly offended
if I asked you

5
00:00:15,382 --> 00:00:17,384
just not to talk about it
and sit quietly?

6
00:00:17,384 --> 00:00:19,085
Can I at least tell you...?

7
00:00:19,085 --> 00:00:21,076
Shh-shh. Please, I do not have
time for your folderol today.

8
00:00:21,388 --> 00:00:22,377
I am meeting Charlotte
for lunch,

9
00:00:23,089 --> 00:00:25,392
and I am planning my strategy
on how to win her over.

10
00:00:25,392 --> 00:00:27,093
I thought you said she has
a boyfriend,

11
00:00:27,093 --> 00:00:28,395
this environmentalist fellow.

12
00:00:28,395 --> 00:00:30,096
Yes. Frank.
Well, so...
Thank you.

13
00:00:30,096 --> 00:00:31,398
What's your plan
to get around him?

14
00:00:31,398 --> 00:00:35,095
I'm merely going to present
myself as the anti-Frank.

15
00:00:36,803 --> 00:00:40,796
Ah, so you're going to be
not rugged and not handsome.

16
00:00:41,307 --> 00:00:42,296
No.

17
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:44,811
You also could be
not passionate
and not committed.

18
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:46,312
Very funny.
Maybe she'd
like you

19
00:00:46,312 --> 00:00:48,314
if you were not interesting
and not informed.

20
00:00:48,314 --> 00:00:49,315
Niles!

21
00:00:49,315 --> 00:00:50,817
Well, you said my
day was folderol!

22
00:00:50,817 --> 00:00:51,806
Sometimes it is!

23
00:00:53,319 --> 00:00:55,321
I don't believe you.
Well, it's true.

24
00:00:55,321 --> 00:00:56,811
My roommate and I used to listen

25
00:00:57,323 --> 00:00:58,825
to your show every day,
just for you.

26
00:00:58,825 --> 00:01:00,326
We fell in love with your voice.

27
00:01:00,326 --> 00:01:02,262
Really?

28
00:01:02,262 --> 00:01:04,764
(soothingly) :
It's just a voice.

29
00:01:04,764 --> 00:01:07,255
Well, all the guys on my floor
listen to you.

30
00:01:07,767 --> 00:01:08,256
To our show?

31
00:01:08,768 --> 00:01:10,770
Yeah.

32
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,761
Boy, things sure
have changed since
I was in college.

33
00:01:13,273 --> 00:01:15,275
Mmm. Well, it wasn't exactly
college. More like prison.

34
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:16,776
Oh, so was mine.

35
00:01:16,776 --> 00:01:18,778
So, where'd you go
?
.

36
00:01:18,778 --> 00:01:20,280
Prison.

37
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,581
Oh.

38
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:24,217
So...

39
00:01:24,217 --> 00:01:27,414
(soothingly):
you fell in love
with my voice?

40
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:28,177
Hi!
Oh!

41
00:01:28,721 --> 00:01:29,210
Charlotte, hi, hi.
Hi.

42
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:30,690
You remember
my brother, Niles?

43
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:31,679
Yes, Charlotte.
Oh, hello!

44
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:32,681
How are you?
Hi.

45
00:01:33,126 --> 00:01:34,694
Well, frustrated.
I've been selling

46
00:01:34,694 --> 00:01:36,696
this guy all over town,
but no one's buying.

47
00:01:36,696 --> 00:01:38,687
Oh, well, perhaps if
you'd throw in a toaster.

48
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:40,188
Oh!

49
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,702
I just have to call Frank
before we head out.

50
00:01:42,702 --> 00:01:44,204
Oh, right.

51
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:46,206
So, everything's settled
between the two of you?

52
00:01:46,206 --> 00:01:47,696
Oh, yeah, he came over
last night.

53
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:50,210
I don't even remember
what we were fighting about.

54
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:51,711
(laughs)

55
00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:54,214
You know what that means,
don't you?!

56
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:57,717
They had a long night
of acrobatic makeup sex.

57
00:01:57,717 --> 00:02:00,208
I just thought of another way
you could be the anti-Frank.

58
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:04,212
Niles?
Hmm?

59
00:02:04,724 --> 00:02:05,725
Keep an eye out for her,
will you?

60
00:02:05,725 --> 00:02:06,726
What are you doing?

61
00:02:06,726 --> 00:02:08,228
Research.

62
00:02:08,228 --> 00:02:09,729
Frasier! Frasier! Foul play!

63
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:11,720
All is fair in love and war.

64
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:15,235
That's interesting.

65
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:18,238
An anthology of Irish plays.

66
00:02:18,238 --> 00:02:19,239
It's perfect!

67
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:20,707
What do you know
about Irish plays?

68
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:22,242
Nothing, but not for long.

69
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:25,211
There's one area where no man
has ever bested me, Niles.

70
00:02:25,211 --> 00:02:27,202
Homework!

71
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:28,715
Oh, uh,
Charlotte, listen.

72
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:30,205
I was just beeped
by a patient

73
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:32,218
who's-who's desperate
to see me.

74
00:02:32,218 --> 00:02:33,720
So, do you mind
if we just switch

75
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,255
Iunch for dinner?

76
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:36,847
.
Actually, that's better for me

77
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:38,858
I have four new clients
coming in.

78
00:02:38,858 --> 00:02:40,860
Just think,
the woman of your dreams

79
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,862
may be sitting in my office
this afternoon.

80
00:02:42,862 --> 00:02:43,851
Indeed she may.

81
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:45,296
(chuckling)

82
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:52,772
Oh, Monsieur, it is so nice
to see you again.

83
00:02:52,772 --> 00:02:54,774
Your special table
is ready for you.

84
00:02:54,774 --> 00:02:56,332
And the wine?
As you requested,
Monsieur.

85
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:58,311
Right. And the roses?
I'm so sorry,
Monsieur.

86
00:02:58,311 --> 00:03:00,313
I felt that the scent
would distract

87
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:02,873
from the wine's
distinctive bouquet.

88
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:04,409
You forgot them, didn't you?
Yes, forgive me.

89
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:06,408
For God's sake, Georges!

90
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:08,311
Send a busboy out to pick
some wildflowers, please.

91
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:10,290
Very good, Monsieur.

92
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:13,293
Gee, you kind of sprinted
ahead of me there.

93
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:15,284
I'm so sorry.

94
00:03:15,795 --> 00:03:17,797
Listen, I just wanted
to make sure that we
could get a good table.

95
00:03:17,797 --> 00:03:19,299
Here, come and sit.

96
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:21,301
This place is kind of fancy
for a working dinner.

97
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:23,303
Yes, well, after the rigors of
your camping trip with Frank,

98
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:26,806
I thought that you deserved
a little elegance.

99
00:03:26,806 --> 00:03:28,535
Thank you.

100
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:29,842
So, good news.

101
00:03:29,842 --> 00:03:32,345
I met this great
woman today.

102
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:33,846
How do you feel

103
00:03:33,846 --> 00:03:36,713
about dating someone a
little taller than you?

104
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:38,618
How much taller?

105
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:40,386
I don't know exactly,

106
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:42,377
but I did have to turn
off the ceiling fan.

107
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:46,422
Well, let's just put her
in the "maybe" pile, shall we?

108
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:51,698
Hi, sweetie.

109
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:53,700
Sorry to interrupt.
I know you're working.

110
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,691
Oh... Frank, you
know Frasier.
Yes, yes, of course.

111
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:57,704
Nice to see
again, Frasier.
Good to see you, Frank.

112
00:03:57,704 --> 00:03:59,405
I just need the keys
to your apartment.

113
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:00,707
I left
my blue field notebook there,

114
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:02,408
and I want to double-check
some old whale songs

115
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:03,397
I copied down.
Oh, sure.

116
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,411
Been in a boat all day
recording whale songs,

117
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:06,412
and I think
we might have had

118
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:07,572
a really big
interpretive breakthrough.

119
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:10,250
Oh! You must tell us
about it sometime.

120
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,018
That's a great wine.
Can I steal a glass?

121
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:14,520
?
.
Yeah, here.
You don't mind, do you

122
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,011
N-No, no.
Not at all.

123
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,959
Although, as the lrish say,

124
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,461
"A man takes a drink,

125
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:23,463
"the drink takes a drink,

126
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:25,954
the drink takes the man. "

127
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,358
That's very good.

128
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:30,734
"As the old cock crows,
the young cock learns. "

129
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:38,043
Yes, well, wasn't it
O'Casey who once wrote:

130
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:40,980
"The Irish treat
a serious thing as a joke

131
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:43,380
and a joke as a serious thing"?

132
00:04:43,549 --> 00:04:46,619
Well, you'd really have to ask Frank about that.

133
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:49,383
He's the one who loves
Irish literature.

134
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:54,427
He lent me an anthology,
but I haven't made
much of a dent in it.

135
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:55,416
I'm sorry, honey, I'm trying.

136
00:04:55,928 --> 00:04:56,929
I know you
are, baby.

137
00:04:56,929 --> 00:04:58,920
The flowers
as you requested, Monsieur.

138
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:01,926
I'm sorry. I thought
you were to bedeux.

139
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:03,469
Yes, well,
now we are trois.

140
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:04,470
Thank you, Georges.

141
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,472
Uh, could you bring us
another glass, please?

142
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:07,632
Yes, I understand,
Monsieur.

143
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,773
It is most sophisticated of you.

144
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:15,315
Frasier, you ordered
these flowers?

145
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,817
Well, the table
just looked so bare.

146
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:18,818
These are great choices, man.

147
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:20,320
These are all
Washington wildflowers.

148
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,821
Remember, from our hike?

149
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:25,825
Foxglove, fine-tooth penstemon,
harsh paintbrush...

150
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,327
Ah!

151
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,329
Remember this one?

152
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,830
Oh, it's on the tip
of my tongue...

153
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,366
Monkey flower.
Monkey flower.

154
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:37,770
Yes, often confused
with the chimp pansy.

155
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,472
(laughing)

156
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:40,773
Frank made the same
joke this morning.

157
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:42,001
Oh!

158
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:42,809
Yeah. Great minds.

159
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:44,510
Ah, yes, yes, yes.

160
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:48,514
(speaking French)

161
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:52,819
(speaking French)

162
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:53,720
Oh.

163
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,711
Terrific.

164
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,028
Hey, how you doing?

165
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,530
Hi. Hey, look at you,
Mr. Handsome.

166
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,020
Oh, thanks.

167
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:09,035
We're going to go hear
Ronee sing at the Rendezvous.

168
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:11,037
And then afterwards,
I am going to give her

169
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,039
her engagement ring.

170
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,030
Oh! Let's have a look.

171
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:16,809
(chuckles)

172
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:19,073
Oh, Martin, it's beautiful.

173
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:20,471
She's going to
love this.

174
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,845
Oh, thanks. You know,
I forgot I had it.

175
00:06:23,015 --> 00:06:24,584
I bought it years ago
for Sherry,

176
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:25,983
but then we broke up.

177
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,722
You can't give Ronee a used ring.

178
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:31,087
Sherry never even touched it.

179
00:06:31,457 --> 00:06:32,525
It doesn't matter.

180
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:34,516
Ronee deserves something
that you picked out
just for her.

181
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:36,929
Well, she'll think I picked this out just for her.

182
00:06:37,463 --> 00:06:38,598
id.
But you didn't.
But she'll think I d

183
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:39,963
But you didn't.

184
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,468
You'll have to sell that one
and buy Ronee a new one.

185
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:44,902
Niles, come on.
Back me up here.

186
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:46,803
You can't be serious.

187
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:50,510
Oh, geez.

188
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,811
Fine.

189
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:53,513
Back in the vault.

190
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:54,172
(chuckles)

191
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:55,581
Some vault!

192
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,583
It's an old cigar box

193
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:01,087
with a bunch of silver dollars
and Eddie's baby teeth.

194
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,952
Oh, hey, Roz.
What are you doing here?

195
00:07:03,222 --> 00:07:04,814
Oh, hi. I was just
shopping around
the corner.

197
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:09,590
That's okay.

198
00:07:09,862 --> 00:07:11,864
I have one myself, with Steve.

199
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:13,559
Oh, yes,
your convict friend.

200
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:14,867
Do you think
that's wise?

201
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:16,569
The man made one mistake.

202
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:17,866
Besides, I don't know any guy

203
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:19,868
who's not a little fascinated
by fire.

204
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:23,832
Yes, and a felon now knows
where you live.

205
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:25,545
(cell phone rings)

206
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:26,846
I'm not at otalidiot.

207
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:28,211
Hello?

208
00:07:28,514 --> 00:07:30,049
Oh, yeah, hi,
Steve.

209
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:33,041
I'm grabbing my coat.
I'll be right down.

210
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:34,645
You--

211
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:39,492
So, you have
a date tonight?

212
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:40,993
Yes, yes, actually,

213
00:07:40,993 --> 00:07:43,496
Charlotte and I have been out
three times this week.

214
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:44,861
We have been wine-tasting,
beach combing,

215
00:07:45,164 --> 00:07:46,199
and we actually
shared a blanket

216
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,700
in a horse-drawn
carriage.

217
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,702
I take it Frank's off
in the mountains again.

218
00:07:49,702 --> 00:07:52,839
Oh, no.
He was there, too.

219
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:54,173
Let's go.

220
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:56,175
You mean, it's been
the three of you all week?

221
00:07:56,175 --> 00:07:57,665
Well, it's not exactly
how I want it,

222
00:07:58,177 --> 00:08:00,179
but the more time
I spend with them,

223
00:08:00,179 --> 00:08:02,010
the less time they get
to spend alone together.

224
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:04,005
It doesn't bother Frank, you
tagging along on their dates?

225
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:07,019
Frank? No. In fact,
he's quite taken with me.

226
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:10,022
Doesn't even occur to him
that I might be a rival.

227
00:08:10,022 --> 00:08:12,024
Galling, yes,
but it does give me more time

228
00:08:12,024 --> 00:08:14,026
to work my magic
on Charlotte.

229
00:08:14,026 --> 00:08:16,517
In another week, you can
kiss Frank good-bye.

230
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:23,169
Maybe we'll wait
till there's not a line.

231
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,158
Hi, guys.

232
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,172
Hello.

233
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,173
Gangsta!

234
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:28,162
What it is!

235
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:29,663
(chuckles)

236
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:34,544
So, what's going on?
I thought we were
meeting downtown.

237
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:36,916
I know. I'm sorry.
But can we stay in tonight?

238
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:39,619
I've got to get up early
and catch a flight to Chicago

239
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:40,677
for some divorce stuff,

240
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:41,954
and Frank's beat.

241
00:08:41,954 --> 00:08:43,649
Yeah, I was at
the beach all day

242
00:08:43,956 --> 00:08:44,945
cataloguing the
stomach contents

243
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:46,659
of a dead elephant seal.

244
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:49,962
It was like all-you-can-eat
down at The Lobster Pot.

245
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:51,554
(laughing):
I'm sorry.

246
00:08:51,764 --> 00:08:55,301
The collapse of our coastal
fisheries is no joke.

247
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:56,700
I'm just punchy.

248
00:08:56,936 --> 00:08:57,970
We brought some movies.

249
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,961
We couldn't agree
on which one to watch,

250
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:02,675
so you break the tie.

251
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:03,976
Well...

252
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:06,570
Hmm.

253
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:09,339
"The Perfect Storm... "

254
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:12,785
or"When Harry Met Sally. "

255
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:15,288
.
I guess I'm going
to have to go for When Harry Met Sally

256
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:17,654
Yes! He'll have
what I'm having!

257
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:28,191
Oh, hi!
Hey.

258
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:30,703
We keep passing
each other.
Yeah.

259
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:32,170
We have some dessert here,
if you want to stay.

260
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:34,071
Oh, no thanks. I've got to cat
an early flight,

261
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:35,675
?
.
but tell Frasier I'll call him

262
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:36,609
Sure.
Bye.

263
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:38,978
Bye-bye.

264
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:40,980
Do I know her?

265
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,982
Yeah, she's the woman
Frasier's been after.

266
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:45,685
She has a boyfriend
already, but maybe
something happened.

267
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:47,983
I'll say! You don't get
that hairstyle sitting up.

268
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,251
Aw, geez.

269
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,230
Well...

270
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:00,698
so long as he's happy.

271
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:08,074
(doorbell rings)

272
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:10,042
MARTIN:
Oh, hi, guys.

273
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:11,744
Hey, Dad.
FRASIER:
Hey, Daphne, Niles.

274
00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:14,046
Listen, the opera tickets
are right there by the phone.

275
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:15,604
Wish I could use them myself.

276
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:17,249
Well, if you'd
gotten a third,

277
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:19,240
you could take that
couple you've been dating.

278
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,891
Yes, that's very droll.

279
00:10:25,891 --> 00:10:27,393
Frank injured himself
on our hike,

280
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:30,260
so I've got Charlotte
all to myself this evening.

281
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,365
I'm not going to waste
this opportunity.

282
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:33,866
I'm going to make her
a romantic dinner

283
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:34,867
and then tell her
how I feel about her.

284
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:36,369
Wow, really?

285
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:37,870
Are, are you sure
she's ready for that?

286
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,372
Well, I don't know,
but I can't stand

287
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:40,873
this ridiculous threesome
anymore.

288
00:10:40,873 --> 00:10:44,377
You know, the worst part
is how completely unthreatening

289
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:47,369
Frank finds me, as if I'm
some sort of a harem eunuch.

290
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,838
How'd he hurt himself, anyway?

291
00:10:49,882 --> 00:10:53,943
Well, he strained his back
carrying me over a brook.

292
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:56,947
You wounded him,
and you're stealing hi
s woman in the same day?

293
00:10:57,423 --> 00:10:58,891
Well, I didn't ask the m
an to carry me.

294
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:00,381
He simply hoisted me
over his shoulder

295
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:01,894
before I could stop him.

296
00:11:01,894 --> 00:11:03,896
That's not something
you get used to,

297
00:11:03,896 --> 00:11:05,261
no matter how many times
it happens.

298
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,767
Don't you worry about it.
You just do what you gotta do.

299
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:08,756
Thanks, Dad.

300
00:11:08,934 --> 00:11:10,670
Wish me luck.

301
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,972
I'm making her beef bourguigno
from a new recipe.

302
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:13,734
MARTIN:
Good luck.

303
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,837
Flour the beef.

304
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:22,882
Mm, you're looking
very sharp.

305
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:24,383
Oh, I got
the new ring.

306
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:25,885
Oh, let's have a look.

307
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:26,874
I sold the old one

308
00:11:27,386 --> 00:11:28,888
and got this new one
this morning.

309
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:31,390
Oh.
Dad, it's huge.

310
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,392
Oh, it's
beautiful, Martin.

311
00:11:33,392 --> 00:11:34,894
Yeah.

312
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:35,895
Hi.
Hey.

313
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:36,884
What's going on?

314
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:38,397
Nothing.

315
00:11:38,397 --> 00:11:41,264
Oh, you look
lovely tonight.

316
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:43,836
But, you know,
I think

317
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:46,839
your hand is kind
of underdressed.

318
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:49,141
Oh, my God!

319
00:11:49,141 --> 00:11:51,701
Marty, it's gorgeous.

320
00:11:51,944 --> 00:11:53,479
Oh, I love it,
and I love you.

321
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:55,481
In that order.

322
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:56,846
Thank you.

323
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:59,118
Listen, I've got
to go wash my hands.

324
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:01,353
I was eating Cheetos
all the way over.

325
00:12:01,353 --> 00:12:03,787
I love this lady.

326
00:12:06,325 --> 00:12:08,327
.
Oh, it's brilliant

327
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:11,785
Oh, you had it
inscribed.

328
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:14,365
I did?

329
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:18,838
"Lil Q-Pid.
Til def do us part. "

330
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:19,497
What is that?

331
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,440
What?
Let me see that.

332
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,807
Isn't Lil Q-Pid
that obese rapper?

333
00:12:26,812 --> 00:12:28,848
The one
they arrested for drugs.

334
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:30,338
Where did you
get this ring?

335
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,852
At an auction.

336
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:35,218
A police auction.

337
00:12:36,822 --> 00:12:38,324
You can't give
that to her.

338
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:40,849
Well, I can't take it back.
She loves it.

339
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:42,018
What are you
gonna tell her?

340
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:43,963
Well, just relax,
I'll handle it.

341
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:47,466
Well, there's my lil cupid.

342
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:51,470
All beautiful
and clean.

343
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:56,976
All you need is a bow
and arrow, lil cupid.

344
00:12:56,976 --> 00:12:59,211
Why are you calling me that?

345
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:00,269
Well, I always call you that.

346
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:02,248
No, no, you don't.

347
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:04,517
Oh, well, maybe I mostly say it
when you're not around

348
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:05,851
Oh, yes.

349
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:08,854
It's always "l
il cupid said this"

350
00:13:08,854 --> 00:13:10,356
or "lil cupid
did that. "

351
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:12,858
It looks
beautiful on you.

352
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:14,348
Thank you.

353
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:17,263
Now promise me
you'll never take it off, lil cupid.

354
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:18,252
Okay, okay, I promise,

355
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:20,266
if you'll
stop calling me that.

356
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:21,267
Deal.

357
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:22,962
I'm going to go look
at this in the mirror.

358
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:29,870
How did you get it
to fit her?

359
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:32,111
Lil Q-Pid's as big
as a house.

360
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:34,013
Keep your
voice down.

361
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:36,072
It was a toe ring.

362
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,480
n,
Here we are, beef bourguigno

363
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:47,993
with saut?ed fiddlehead ferns,

364
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:49,483
and walnut
chutney.

365
00:13:49,895 --> 00:13:51,163
.
It's my own recipe

366
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:54,567
It's exactly what I need
after the day I've had.

367
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:56,159
Well, maybe I could
give you a neck rub

368
00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:57,603
while it cools.

370
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:04,109
all this business
with me and Frank.

371
00:14:04,109 --> 00:14:06,111
What business?

372
00:14:06,111 --> 00:14:07,613
Well, you know.

373
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:09,114
Just all this tension
between us.

374
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:11,617
There's tension?

375
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:14,119
He's a great guy.

376
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:16,622
We just seem to be...

377
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:18,123
I don't know...

378
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:20,114
Fighting?
Growing apart?

379
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:21,627
Not clicking?

380
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:23,492
(knocking)

381
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:24,520
FRANK:
Charlotte?

382
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:26,332
Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.

383
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:27,333
It's my watch. It's caught.

384
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:29,198
Here...

385
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:33,962
Should have known.

386
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:35,407
The minute I'm laid up,

387
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:37,307
you're over here
making my lady dinner.

388
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:40,136
You're true blue, buddy.

389
00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:43,148
Hi, baby.

390
00:14:43,148 --> 00:14:44,137
Hello, Frank.

391
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:49,655
Walnut chutney.
That's daring.

392
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:51,924
Were you giving her a backrub?

393
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:53,050
Was I?

394
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:55,060
Well, yes, yes,
I suppose I was.

395
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,221
Would you mind doing me?

396
00:14:57,463 --> 00:14:58,998
I took an aspirin
after our hike,

397
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:00,989
but my neck's stilI a little tight.

398
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,501
So tell me all
about Chicago.

399
00:15:02,501 --> 00:15:03,991
How was it?

400
00:15:04,436 --> 00:15:06,005
I'll tell you later.

401
00:15:06,005 --> 00:15:07,495
Oh, that's nice.

402
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:10,175
Frasier,
stop rubbing his neck.

403
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:11,164
Sit down.

404
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,135
Why can't he rub my neck?

405
00:15:13,512 --> 00:15:14,546
Because when
you came in,

406
00:15:14,546 --> 00:15:16,048
we were just sitting
down to dinner.

407
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:17,538
You could
have called first.

408
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,449
Well, I didn't know I needed
to get clearance. Geez.

409
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:22,443
You're as touchy
as a Hermit Thrush.

410
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:23,419
This is typical of you.

411
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,424
You come in here,

412
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:26,425
you expect me
to change my plans

413
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:27,927
because you're
suddenly available.

414
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:28,689
It's insensitive.

415
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:30,029
Oh, I'm insensitive?

416
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:31,530
I've been tracking
a pod of humpback whales

417
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:33,532
for a week, and they've been
talking their asses off,

418
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:35,534
but have you once asked me
what Bonnie has to say?

419
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:37,169
Or Robert or Grace?

420
00:15:37,169 --> 00:15:38,103
They're whales!

421
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:38,967
They're my friends!

422
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,074
Stop yelling.

423
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:44,008
Look, you're
upsetting Frasier.

424
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:45,611
I didn't do anything.

425
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,101
I came in, kissed you hello,
and you jumped down my throat.

426
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:48,480
What is your problem?

427
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,082
You are
driving me crazy.

428
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:51,083
Do you
believe her?

429
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:53,085
Don't you drag him
into this.

430
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:54,074
You know what? I can't
deal with this tonight.

431
00:15:54,386 --> 00:15:55,387
When can you
deal with it?

432
00:15:55,387 --> 00:15:56,388
I'll call ahead an
d make an appointment.

433
00:15:56,388 --> 00:15:57,377
I think you
should leave.

434
00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:59,091
Fine.

435
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:00,080
Come on, Frasier.
Let's go.

436
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:05,688
Times like this, a guy
really needs his buddy.

437
00:16:15,507 --> 00:16:17,142
(soft knocking)

438
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:18,131
Mm...

439
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:20,975
Hi.

440
00:16:23,282 --> 00:16:25,750
Just wanted to see
how you're doing.

441
00:16:26,251 --> 00:16:27,240
Tip-top.

442
00:16:28,253 --> 00:16:31,123
How's your friend?

443
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:34,024
He went someplace dark.

444
00:16:34,193 --> 00:16:37,196
I couldn't follow.

445
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:39,698
Him and his moods.

446
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:43,435
No, no, he climbed
some kind of pine tree.

447
00:16:43,435 --> 00:16:46,739
Look, I'm sorry
about all that.

448
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:49,742
I think this is it
for Frank and me.

449
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:52,040
Really?

450
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:53,212
It's just not working.

451
00:16:53,212 --> 00:16:55,214
I think I was always attracted

452
00:16:55,214 --> 00:17:01,210
to the idea of him
more than... him.

453
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:06,725
This may seem
inappropriate,

454
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:09,592
but I'm not entirely s
ad to hear you say that.

455
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:14,566
What do you mean?

456
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:17,057
I would think my feelings
were obvious by now,

457
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:19,805
all the time we've bee
n spending together.

458
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:21,306
I just thought it was because

459
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:23,308
you were hitting it off
with Frank.

460
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:24,297
Are you kidding?

461
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:27,312
The man smells
like a chum boat.

462
00:17:27,312 --> 00:17:31,646
You, you're the on
e I wanted to be with.

463
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:36,551
Look, um...

464
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:38,553
I realize you're i
n a vulnerable state,

465
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:41,260
and you probably need
some time to process this,

466
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,261
.
so I'll just, uh..

467
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:43,558
Don't go.

468
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:49,568
I've been thinking a little about you, too.

469
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:52,171
Really?

470
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:54,139
(chuckles nervously)

471
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:01,678
Well, then...

472
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:16,695
Oh, God,
I'm uncomfortable.

473
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:18,197
.
I'm sorry.
I'm rushing things

474
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:19,198
No, no, I'm just...

475
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:20,688
I'm laying
on a wine bottle.

476
00:18:33,145 --> 00:18:34,703
Good morning.

477
00:18:38,183 --> 00:18:39,551
Oh, dear God.

478
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:41,246
Please tell me nothing
happened last night.

479
00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:45,288
I'm kidding.
I'm kidding.

480
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:49,294
(chuckling)

481
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:51,296
I'm glad you stayed.

482
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:52,524
Me, too.

483
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:54,855
Hey, guys.

484
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,705
You're in my robe.

485
00:19:05,511 --> 00:19:07,513
I guess you got caught
in the rain, too, huh?

486
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:10,215
Yes, I did.

487
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:13,207
What happened to your hand?

488
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:14,486
(groans)

489
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:17,189
I was so mad
last night, I...

490
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:19,491
I punched a raccoon.

491
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,482
.
God, I'm a bastard

492
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,896
You're a good guy
to come check on her.

493
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:26,364
I never understand
why women don't like you.

494
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:30,903
Can we talk?

495
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:32,871
Yeah, I think
that's a good idea.

496
00:19:32,871 --> 00:19:35,863
Uh, my clothes
should be dry by now.

497
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:43,348
?
.
So what's going on with us

498
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:45,851
Oh, come on, Frank.

499
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:49,388
I think you know
it's not working.

500
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:51,413
Yeah.

501
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:55,359
And, anyway, there is
something else you should know.

502
00:19:56,728 --> 00:19:58,230
When I was in Chicago,

503
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:01,733
my ex told me
he's moving to New York.

504
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:05,726
So I bought
the old business from him.

505
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:08,229
I'm moving back home.

506
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,642
(sighs)

507
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:12,633
You sure about this?

508
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:14,313
Yeah.

509
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:15,814
I mean,
I know Chicago.

510
00:20:15,814 --> 00:20:17,304
I have friends there.

511
00:20:17,816 --> 00:20:19,818
Seattle just hasn't
panned out for me.

512
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:21,820
I thought you should be
the first to know.

513
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:26,382
Well, I know
you'll do great.

514
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,261
So will you.

515
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:32,253
Ah...

516
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:33,623
Uh, I should
be going.

517
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:35,334
That's okay.

518
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:36,323
You stay.
I'm going.

519
00:20:38,637 --> 00:20:41,333
You know this isn't
your fault, right, partner?

520
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:46,766
You be good, buddy.

521
00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:57,289
I know I should feel
sad for Frank,

522
00:20:57,289 --> 00:20:58,688
but I can't help
feeling happy.

523
00:20:59,124 --> 00:21:00,386
Frasier, I...

524
00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:04,630
Listen, I'm late
for about three things,

525
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:06,632
so can I see you
later this afternoon?

526
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:08,300
Maybe after my show?

527
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,302
Okay.
After your show.

528
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:11,303
Perfect.

529
00:21:11,303 --> 00:21:14,295
Uh, look, I hate
to jinx this, but...
