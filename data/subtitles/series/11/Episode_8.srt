1
00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:11,473
Hey, Daph. Hello, Martin.

2
00:00:12,479 --> 00:00:14,037
What's that?

3
00:00:14,147 --> 00:00:15,715
Oh, it's Frasier and
Niles's old playpen.

4
00:00:15,715 --> 00:00:17,217
Got it out of storage for you.

5
00:00:17,217 --> 00:00:19,219
Looks a bit rickety.

6
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:21,016
Nah, it just needs a
little weight to balance it.

7
00:00:21,154 --> 00:00:23,723
Put a baby in there, and it'll be fine.

8
00:00:23,723 --> 00:00:25,213
(both gasping)

9
00:00:28,728 --> 00:00:30,230
You're not putting my
baby in that deathtrap,

10
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:32,130
and by the way, did you move your gun

11
00:00:32,632 --> 00:00:34,134
out to storage, like you promised?

12
00:00:34,134 --> 00:00:35,635
I'm getting to it.

13
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:38,138
What? That gun is
still around? Oh, geez.

14
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:40,129
Dad, two years ago, I
demanded you get rid of it.

15
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,142
You said you did.

16
00:00:42,142 --> 00:00:43,143
Don't tell me it's still in your closet.

17
00:00:43,143 --> 00:00:45,211
No. It's in a shoe box under my bed.

18
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:47,514
Well, I don't want it
he re in my apartment.

19
00:00:47,514 --> 00:00:49,582
All right, all right,
it'll go into storage today,

20
00:00:49,582 --> 00:00:51,584
but I don't know what we'll
do if a burglar breaks in.

21
00:00:51,584 --> 00:00:55,188
You could lure him into that playpen.

22
00:00:55,188 --> 00:00:58,091
You slept awfully late. Mm, yeah,

23
00:00:58,091 --> 00:01:00,193
oh, well, I was having
the most distressing dream.

24
00:01:00,193 --> 00:01:02,495
I was climbing up a volcano

25
00:01:02,495 --> 00:01:06,199
that was spewing ice instead of lava.

26
00:01:06,199 --> 00:01:08,326
Ice volcano. Wonder
what that could mean.

27
00:01:08,701 --> 00:01:09,769
Oh, what's this?

28
00:01:09,769 --> 00:01:10,758
Hello, it's Lilith.

29
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:12,772
Oh, well... Ah, okay.

30
00:01:12,772 --> 00:01:13,761
We're supposed to be having breakfast,

31
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:15,263
but you're not here,

32
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:17,510
and, as I don't know if you're tardy

33
00:01:17,844 --> 00:01:19,412
or have been in a terrible accident,

34
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:22,745
I am unable to commit to an
appropriate emotional response.

35
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:25,516
Please call me. Thank you.

36
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:27,520
Oh, damn, I completely forgot.

37
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,222
Lilith is in town for
a one-day conference.

38
00:01:29,222 --> 00:01:30,523
Now I'll have to
canceI lunch to see her.

39
00:01:30,523 --> 00:01:32,218
Can't you catch her on the next trip?

40
00:01:32,525 --> 00:01:33,389
No, no, she'll only be hurt,

41
00:01:33,626 --> 00:01:35,228
and of course, she'll...
she'll dredge it up

42
00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:37,219
the next time she needs
an emotional trump card.

43
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:41,461
Ooh! Maybe I can trick her
into canceling lunch on me.

44
00:01:41,734 --> 00:01:44,804
Instead of playing games, why
don't you just talk to her ? .

45
00:01:44,804 --> 00:01:46,306
We tried talking when we were married.

46
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:47,295
We were better at games.

47
00:01:49,809 --> 00:01:51,811
Hello, Lilith. It's
Frasier. Gosh, I'm so sorry.

48
00:01:51,811 --> 00:01:53,301
I was on my way to breakfast, and, uh...

49
00:01:53,813 --> 00:01:55,804
I-I swerved to avoid
hitting a Pomeranian,

50
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:59,119
and I-I ran up on the
curb and blew a tire.

51
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,254
All right, well, maybe if
you come by here for lunch.

52
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:03,814
(gasps) She won't, she won 't.

53
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:05,325
Okay, then.

54
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:07,225
All right, see you
here around 1 :00. Okay.

55
00:02:10,163 --> 00:02:11,152
Damn.

56
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:13,156
She came to play.

57
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:20,300
Hey. Hello.

58
00:02:21,574 --> 00:02:22,563
Hey, Niles. Hey, Dad.

59
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:24,268
Hey, do you want to join us for lunch?

60
00:02:24,577 --> 00:02:25,578
We're trying a new Indonesian place

61
00:02:25,578 --> 00:02:27,273
that's famous for its Besengek Daging.

62
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:30,850
Well, wish I could,
but I promised Frasier

63
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:32,852
I'd stay here till he
got back from the dentist.

64
00:02:32,852 --> 00:02:35,321
Oh, well, we'll keep you company.

65
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:37,186
Why'd he need you to hang around?

66
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,148
He's making lunch for Lilith.

67
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,149
And off we go.

68
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:43,163
(doorbell rings)

69
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,664
Too late.

70
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:46,166
Shouldn't you get the door?

71
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,667
You're closer.

72
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:48,668
I don't live here.

73
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:50,170
Doesn't matter. You're family.

74
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,161
So is Daphne... Oh, no, you don't.

75
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:53,604
LILITH: Maybe if you slid me a key,

76
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,502
I could let myself in.

77
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:00,246
Hey, Lilith!

78
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:01,514
Sorry for the holdup, but, uh,

79
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:03,209
Frasier should be back
from the dentist any minute.

80
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:04,505
Oh, all right.

81
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:06,515
That'll give us a chance to visit.

82
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:15,228
Daphne, Niles, congratulations

83
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:18,231
on the successful commingling
of your genetic material.

84
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:19,532
Thank you.

85
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:20,521
Do you know the sex?

86
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:22,531
Do we? That's how we got pregnant.

87
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:27,536
Thank you. No, we're-we're...

88
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:29,242
we're going to let it be a surprise.

89
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:30,543
Oh, okay. Please sit down.

90
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:32,545
Thank you.

91
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:35,248
Well, if I was to
guess the gender--

92
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:38,551
and I'm usually right
about half the time...

93
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:39,540
I'm being humorous, of course.

94
00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:41,254
(laughs)

95
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:43,556
 I would say it's a boy.

96
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:45,258
Oh. What makes you say that?

97
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:46,559
Well, it's highly unscientific,

98
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:48,261
but the proverbial old wives

99
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:51,264
would cite the spreading of your nose,

100
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:53,566
the unevenness of your breasts,

101
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:56,933
and the coarse black hair on your legs.

102
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:02,675
Interesting.

103
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:05,667
Is that the shoe box
from under your bed, then?

104
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:10,239
(cell phone ringing)

105
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:11,441
Excuse me.

106
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:14,454
Hello?

107
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:15,955
Yes, Frasier.

108
00:04:15,955 --> 00:04:17,457
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

109
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:18,958
Hear what?

110
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:20,448
He's still coming, isn't he?

111
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,861
Yes, all right, all right.

112
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:23,863
I'll meet you then. Bye.

113
00:04:23,863 --> 00:04:24,864
Frasier can't make it.

114
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:25,865
Oh...

115
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:27,867
well, if you still want lunch,

116
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:29,858
I've got leftover meat loaf 
that's today or never.

117
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,872
Thank you, but I'll get
something at the conference.

118
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:33,873
Ahh...

119
00:04:33,873 --> 00:04:35,375
There's a bulimia talk today

120
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,377
and I'll wager that's one lecture hall

121
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:39,379
with a snack machine outside.

122
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:40,744
Lovely to see you.

123
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,549
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.

124
00:04:43,549 --> 00:04:44,984
Did you hear what she said about me?

125
00:04:44,984 --> 00:04:46,452
Yes.

126
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:48,454
That I've got a flat nose,
uneven boobs and bristly legs?

127
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:49,756
I mean, are they really that bad?

128
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:51,758
Not bad.

129
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:56,462
Maybe a little cock-eyed,
but with a heavy sweater...

130
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:58,453
I was talking about my legs.

131
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:01,768
Oh, forget about lunch.

132
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:03,463
I'm just going to make a sandwich.

133
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:06,762
Oh, no, hey... what about me?

134
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:08,337
Oh, have a banana.

135
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:11,010
(gunshot)

136
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,011
DAPHNE: My God!

137
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:13,012
What was that?

138
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:16,516
I think the banana went off.

139
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:17,813
You knocked my gun on the floor.

140
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:19,519
Is everyone all right?

141
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:20,520
Daphne, are you all right?

142
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,987
Yeah, I'm fine. Dad, you okay?

143
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:23,887
Yeah, I'm fine. I don't understand this.

144
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,755
I thought the safety was on.

145
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:27,960
Oh, my God, it blew a hole
through Frasier's chair.

146
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,362
(Martin gasping)

147
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:32,365
And it shot the head off the statue.

148
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:35,368
Look what it did to the fireplace.

149
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:36,636
MARTIN: Oh, no, Frasier's
going to kill me.

150
00:05:36,636 --> 00:05:37,704
This is why I've been telling you

151
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:39,069
to put the bloody thing in storage.

152
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:40,873
Niles was the one who
knocked it off the table.

153
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:43,376
Well, accidentally, because
I had a banana thrown at me!

154
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:45,378
To you, not at you.

155
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:48,381
And you should know
how to catch a banana!

156
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:50,110
I am not having this argument again!

157
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:54,687
If Frasier sees this,
I'll never hear the end of it. 

158
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:57,554
You guys have to help me fix
things up before he gets home.

159
00:05:57,957 --> 00:05:59,759
Forget it, old man. You're on your own.

160
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,095
If he kicks me out over
this, I'm moving in with you.

161
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:04,497
All right, what's the plan? . 

162
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:05,898
You start calling upholsterers.

163
00:06:05,898 --> 00:06:07,889
Niles, get me some Spackle.

164
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:10,460
I'll see if I can Crazy Glue
the head back on that thing.

165
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:19,434
Dad, Dad... what's Spackle?

166
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:25,952
Anyway, long story short,

167
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:30,456
" . six months in he says
I'm "too tightly wound

168
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:31,445
Me.

169
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,961
Wow, I don't know what to tell you, Lil.

170
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:37,452
Lilith. My name is Lilith.

171
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,432
(pager vibrating)

172
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:40,933
Oh, it's my beeper.

173
00:06:40,933 --> 00:06:44,937
Oh, darn, they need me
back at the conference.

174
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:47,428
Okay, but listen, we all
have bad dating experiences,

175
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:48,808
so don't give up.

176
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:51,677
Get out there, have fun, meet people.

177
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:53,179
You're right.

178
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:54,180
Thank you, Nancy.

179
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,681
You're a real pal.

180
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:58,684
And the best survivor guilt

181
00:06:58,684 --> 00:07:00,675
and phantom limb expert in the game.

182
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:05,191
Excuse me. Excuse me.

183
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:06,192
Roz... Roz?

184
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:08,694
Oh, hi, Lilith. What
are you doing in town?

185
00:07:08,694 --> 00:07:09,695
Well, I'm here for a conference

186
00:07:09,695 --> 00:07:11,697
and was supposed to meet
Frasier here for coffee,

187
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:13,199
 but I'm afraid I have to leave.

188
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,188
 Will you tell him I'll call him later?

189
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:15,701
Sure, no problem.

190
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:16,690
Thank you. Bye-bye.

191
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:19,205
Can I have change for the meter?

192
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:20,706
Only if you buy something.

193
00:07:20,706 --> 00:07:22,708
I don't have time--
the meter maid's coming.

194
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:23,697
Sorry, can't do it.

195
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:26,712
Well, someone doesn't
want his tip very much.

196
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:28,214
You haven't ordered anything.

197
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:30,216
I meant the tip I gave you yesterday.

198
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:31,717
Oh, hi, Roz. Hey, Frasier.

199
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:34,220
Oh, um, Lilith had to leave.

200
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,209
Oh, damn! Again?

201
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:39,225
Can I help you?

202
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:40,214
Yes... Yes, I'd like.

203
00:07:40,726 --> 00:07:42,228
Oh, I'm terribly sorry
. Please, go ahead.

204
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:43,229
No. that's all right. You go.

205
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:44,730
No, I insist--
after you.

206
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:45,731
We'll go together.

207
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:47,233
What're you having?

208
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:49,735
All right-- a
macchiato for here.

209
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:51,737
One macchiato for here

210
00:07:51,737 --> 00:07:54,740
and a Mocha Valencia to go, please.

211
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,242
Macchiato man.

212
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:57,743
Don't meet many of those.

213
00:07:57,743 --> 00:07:59,245
No, no...

214
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:01,747
We're a... a rare breed.

215
00:08:01,747 --> 00:08:03,738
Spartan... rugged...

216
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,251
You like a dusting of
nutmeg on that, right?

217
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:07,242
Just a sprinkle.

218
00:08:07,753 --> 00:08:09,255
So, is this your first time here?

219
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:10,256
Yeah. I'm in town on business.

220
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:11,757
First time in Seattle.

221
00:08:11,757 --> 00:08:13,748
That entitles you to a
complimentary beverage.

222
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,261
These are on me.

223
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:16,762
Thank you.

224
00:08:16,762 --> 00:08:20,755
Tell me, is there a Mrs. Macchiato?

225
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:23,258
(chuckles) : No.

226
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:24,770
This may sound a little crazy,

227
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:26,272
but would you be interested

228
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:28,774
in having a drink later
with a friend of mine?

229
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:31,265
I think you might really hit it off.

230
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:34,580
Well, it sounds intriguing.

231
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:37,572
I'm late for a meeting,
but if you're game,

232
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:40,586
Iet's just say 7:00
at the Marina Tavern.

233
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:43,089
And if you change your
mind, here's my number.

234
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:44,078
All right, then.

235
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:51,097
Roz, have you ever been set
up on a date with someone

236
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:52,598
 whose name you didn't know? .

237
00:08:52,598 --> 00:08:54,600
Oh, please, I've woken up with dates

238
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,102
now. whose names I didn't k

239
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:57,103
Cappuccino, please.

240
00:08:57,103 --> 00:08:58,104
What's going on?

241
00:08:58,104 --> 00:09:00,606
Well, I just met this woman

242
00:09:00,606 --> 00:09:02,108
who's in town on business.

243
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:05,111
She asked me to join a friend of hers

244
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:07,113
for a drink at the Marina Tavern.

245
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:10,105
Oh... well, you know there is no friend.

246
00:09:10,616 --> 00:09:12,618
The woman you met is
the woman you're meeting.

247
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:14,108
Oh, that's what I thought.

248
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,122
I wonder why she
wouldn't give me her name?

249
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:18,124
Well, when you're in tow n on business

250
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:20,115
and you hook up with a stranger,

251
00:09:20,626 --> 00:09:23,629
no names is standard procedure.

252
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:25,620
I'm not sure that's something

253
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:27,633
you want to admit knowing, Roz.

254
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:31,137
I only know it from reading
Erica Jong novels, okay?

255
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:33,139
I'm not sure that's something

256
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:34,128
you want to admit, either.

257
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:40,012
(door opening)

258
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:41,702
I've got the Spackle.

259
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:43,709
Good, good-- we'll
fill in the crack,

260
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,685
then my faux finisher
can match the stone.

261
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:47,687
Fabrizio is on his way
here to re-upholster.

262
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:48,676
Dad, how are you doing?

263
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:49,989
Great.

264
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:51,991
 This glue should hold it just fine.

265
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:52,992
Your guys better get over here soon.

266
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:54,660
Frasier's meeting Lilith
after work at the cafe,

267
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,962
which only gives us...

268
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:56,951
FRASIER: Oh, hello, Mrs. Richman.

269
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:58,297
(whispering): Shh! Frasier!

270
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:02,157
Ahh!

271
00:10:10,843 --> 00:10:13,346
Hello, what's going on?

272
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:14,836
Oh, just admiring the sunset.

273
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:18,884
I think it looks best over here,

274
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:20,875
but Niles thinks it
looks better over there.

275
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:22,154
FRASIER: Oh, really?

276
00:10:22,154 --> 00:10:23,155
Oh, Niles,

277
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:26,158
have you changed your
mind about my new statue?

278
00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:29,161
Yesterday you said it
was sterile and unmoving.

279
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:30,651
 Oh, it's moving now.

280
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:34,967
Well, I'd love to stay
and gloat, but I have

281
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,669
a very intriguing date
for which I must get ready.

282
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:38,330
Well, good luck with
that. Thank you, Dad.

283
00:10:38,704 --> 00:10:39,796
Oh, what's this?

284
00:10:40,272 --> 00:10:41,762
LILITH: Frasier, I'm
just leaving the cafe.

285
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:43,230
Sorry I missed you.

286
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:45,077
Anyway, if you're available for a drink,

287
00:10:45,077 --> 00:10:46,806
I'm staying at the Harbor View .

288
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:47,670
Call me.

289
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:49,637
Oh, dear... damn!

290
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,138
I've got an exciting mystery date

291
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:54,153
and who should rear her head
at the last minute but Lilith.

292
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:56,088
MARTIN: Well, you know,
if you leave right away,

293
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:57,990
you'd probably have time
for a quick drink with Lilith

294
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:58,854
and still make for your date.

295
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:00,159
Good thinking, Dad.

296
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,161
I could dispense with the pleasantries

297
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:04,152
and be on my way.

298
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:05,653
Help me, help me. The
head is stuck to my hand.

299
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:09,659
(yelling)

300
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:11,370
FRASIER: On second thought...

301
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:15,708
maybe I should invite Lilith here

302
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:17,676
so that I can have
more time to get ready.

303
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,445
ALL: No!

304
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:20,980
She's already been here once.

305
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,682
You should go to her.

306
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:23,876
You're quite right,

307
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:25,885
but, then, should I change
or am I fine the way I am?

308
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:27,785
Fine. Oh, hubba-hubba.

309
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,280
Well, then, I'll just see you all later.

310
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:38,964
Dad, you're right.

311
00:11:39,398 --> 00:11:41,889
It's a much, much
different sunset from here.

312
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,847
(flatly): Yes, of course
I'm excited, Nancy.

313
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:56,882
Can't you hear it in
the timbre of my voice?

314
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:59,218
Yes, well, I'm afraid I
might a little bit late.

315
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:01,049
I'm still waiting for my ex-husband.

316
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:03,022
(knocking) Oh, there he is.

317
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:06,025
I'll get through this as
quickly as I possibly can.

318
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:07,014
Yes, all right. Bye.

319
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:10,730
Hi, Lilith.

320
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,031
I'm sorry I'm late.

321
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:13,733
Traffic was a bear.

322
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,735
It's good to see you.

323
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:16,736
Likewise.

324
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,037
Anyway, I'm sorry about

325
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:19,732
all the missed connections today,

326
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:21,768
but at least we have a chance
to catch up, however briefly.

327
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:23,809
Yes, well, sometimes with old friends

328
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:24,798
five minutes is enough.

329
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,112
Ha.

330
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:27,913
One minute.

331
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:29,281
So, care for a drink?

332
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:31,016
Not if I'm keeping you from something.

333
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:33,883
Well, actually, I do
have a date this evening.

334
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:35,054
Oh, really?

335
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:36,419
Yes. A colleague of mine fixed me up.

336
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:37,923
I'm sorry for dragging you over here

337
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:40,960
when I have so little time to give you.

338
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,427
Actually, I'm running
late for a date myself.

339
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:43,796
I see.

340
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:45,297
Well, why don 't you run along?

341
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:46,799
I wouldn't want you
to keep Niles waiting.

342
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:48,198
(chuckles)

343
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:50,069
No. It is
with a woman--

344
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:52,299
a very vibrant, sexy woman.

345
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:53,136
Ah. Good for you.

346
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:54,134
Listen, if you're running late

347
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:55,900
and you need to cancel our drink...

348
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:58,244
No, no, no, I've canceled
on you once already today.

349
00:12:58,244 --> 00:13:01,042
Well, I canceled on you twice.
 That would make us even.

350
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:02,939
That's why we're having the drink.

351
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:04,816
Ah.

352
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:06,385
Unless you're worried
that your sexy date

353
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:07,943
will leave if you' re five minutes late.

354
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:09,255
Oh, no, not at all.

355
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:10,256
My absence will only make

356
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:11,824
her heart grow fonder.

357
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:13,826
You mind if I use the bathroom?

358
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:14,815
Certainly. Thank you.

359
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,456
Please don't leave. Please don't leave.

360
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:22,456
Please don't leave.

361
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,972
Hello.

362
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:28,407
Miss Mocha Valencia.

363
00:13:28,407 --> 00:13:30,810
Yes, Macchiatto man here.

364
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,074
Uh, listen, I'm glad I caught you.

365
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:34,914
Hi. Where are you?

366
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:36,415
Uh, well...

367
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:38,406
something's come up, and
I'm afraid I have to...

368
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:40,408
Wait, hang on. I have another call.

369
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,921
Fine.

370
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:42,910
Hello.

371
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:44,411
Nancy, it's Lilith again.

372
00:13:44,924 --> 00:13:46,414
Listen, this thing with my ex-husband

373
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:48,427
is taking a lot longer than I expected,

374
00:13:48,427 --> 00:13:50,429
but I will be there, I promise you.

375
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:51,864
Uh-oh.

376
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:53,263
 What do you mean "uh-oh"

377
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:56,168
I'm on the other line
with your date right now.

378
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:57,870
I think he wants to cancel.

379
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:00,172
Before he' s even met me?

380
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:02,163
Tell him I canceled on him first.

381
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:03,876
Okay.

382
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:06,174
I'm really sorry about this.

383
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:10,178
Hi. So I'm afraid tonight's off.

384
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:12,184
Off?

385
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:13,185
Yeah, that was my friend.

386
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:14,880
She had second thoughts.

387
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:17,189
Oh, really?

388
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:20,192
Well, please tell your "friend"

389
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:22,194
that I wasn't exactly bowled over

390
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:23,183
by her first thoughts.

391
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,896
I don't even know what that means.

392
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:36,008
So what would you say to that drink?

393
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:38,310
I'd say, don't get too
comfortable in that glass.

394
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:39,299
(chuckles)

395
00:14:43,315 --> 00:14:45,017
Well, this is nice.

396
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:47,315
Yes, very.

397
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:54,322
Freddy tells me he dissected a frog.

398
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:57,897
Yes, and a fetal pig.

399
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,195
Of course, I made him
do his homework first.

400
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,206
Lilith, you seem preoccupied.

401
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:09,408
Is this about your blind date tonight?

402
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:12,411
You could say that.

403
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:15,346
Well, for what it's worth,
whoever this guy is...

404
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:18,617
he'll feel awfully lucky when
you walk through the door.

405
00:15:18,617 --> 00:15:20,084
Thank you, Frasier,

406
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,588
but I really shouldn't be
keeping you from your date.

407
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:23,956
Oh, right.

408
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:25,958
Well, I guess I should be going, yes.

409
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:28,460
Although, you know, you
are here for just one night.

410
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:31,463
Perhaps I could call and
push things back a bit?

411
00:15:31,463 --> 00:15:33,021
Maybe I could delay mine as well.

412
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:34,066
Great.

413
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:35,100
All right.

414
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,102
What excuse are you going to use?

415
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:38,604
Oh, I'll just trot
out my stand-by--

416
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:39,939
it works every time.

417
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:40,928
Simply say that I swerved

418
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,942
to avoid hitting a Chihuahua,

419
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,933
ran up on a curb and blew a tire.

420
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:50,449
This morning you said
it was a Pomeranian.

421
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:52,610
Well, this morning it was.

422
00:15:58,057 --> 00:16:00,082
FRASIER: So I'm in the
middle of this date from hell,

423
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:02,161
when Kenny walks in with his cousin,

424
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:04,163
whom I'd passed on sight unseen.

425
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:06,165
Turns out she's not only gorgeous,

426
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:08,065
but her name is actually Miss Wright.

427
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:11,370
Okay, you win. Mm-hmm.

428
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:15,033
Say, are there any more
kettle chips in the mini bar?

429
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:18,344
No. We can have either
Gummi Bears or cashews,

430
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:20,346
both. but I'm afraid we can't afford

431
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:22,047
(door slams)

432
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:23,036
MAN: Erin, would you stop?

433
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:24,748
I don't even know what I did.

434
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:28,253
ERIN: Why do you always say
that like you think it will help?

435
00:16:28,253 --> 00:16:30,255
Because when I guess, you get angrier!

436
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:32,746
Boy, that takes you back, doesn't it?

437
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,196
MAN: What, did I forget
to notice your hair?

438
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:38,697
That's not why I'm mad.

439
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:40,699
I'm just going to ask them to be quiet.

440
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:42,701
MAN: I can't talk to you
when you're like this.

441
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:43,690
I'm going out.

442
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:45,204
ERIN: Sean, what are you doing?

443
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:46,205
Oh, uh... Sorry.

444
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:47,706
That's not the hall.

445
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:48,707
Yes, uh...

446
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:50,572
It's all right.

447
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:53,112
You see, we overheard your quarrel,

448
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:56,281
and in the interest of
keeping the peace and quiet,

449
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:58,283
maybe we could offer some assistance.

450
00:16:58,283 --> 00:17:00,285
It's okay, we can handle it ourselves.

451
00:17:00,285 --> 00:17:02,776
Oh, can you, Sean?

452
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:05,279
You don't even know what you did.

453
00:17:05,624 --> 00:17:08,149
Please, won't you come in?

454
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:13,232
We are psychiatrists.

455
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:15,234
There's no need to be afraid.

456
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:17,569
We are here to help.

457
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:21,562
So, what, you're like caped
crusaders for mental health?

458
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:24,405
No, not caped.

459
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:25,835
Please, come and sit down.

460
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:28,211
All right then.

461
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:32,151
What seems to be the problem?

462
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:33,140
Uh...

463
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:35,154
When we were at dinner,

464
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:37,456
he was checking out another woman.

465
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:39,324
And you feel threatened by this?

466
00:17:39,324 --> 00:17:41,258
Shouldn't I? Well, maybe.

467
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,095
 Shot in the dark here:

468
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:45,130
your parents are divorced; Dad left Mom.

469
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:47,155
Yeah. How'd you know?

470
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:49,168
It's classic transference.

471
00:17:49,168 --> 00:17:51,170
Because your father and mother split up,

472
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:53,172
you overreact whenever
you perceive a threat

473
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:55,106
to your current relationship.

474
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:56,775
And, you, you care about this woman?

475
00:17:56,775 --> 00:17:57,643
Absolutely.

476
00:17:57,643 --> 00:17:59,201
Then keep your eye s in your head.

477
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,813
It bugs her and it's bad form. 

478
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:04,783
And if he should fail at this,

479
00:18:04,783 --> 00:18:06,273
which he will,
he's a man--

480
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:08,787
it does not mean he's
going to leave you.

481
00:18:08,787 --> 00:18:11,517
you. Or that I don't love

482
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:13,223
Because I do.

483
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:15,427
I know.

484
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:16,792
I love you, too.

485
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:22,529
Wow, you guys are good.

486
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:26,772
ERIN: Yeah, that was amazing.

487
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:29,240
So, do you two just have
the best marriage ever?

488
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:34,513
Actually...

489
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:37,209
Yes... we do.

490
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:40,285
Well, uh... thank you.

491
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:41,787
It was really nice meeting you.

492
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:42,776
Likewise, likewise.

493
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:45,491
You seem like an awfully
nice young couple,

494
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:48,494
and I'm sure you'll
understand if I lock the door.

495
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:49,483
Good night.

496
00:18:50,195 --> 00:18:51,230
Good night.

497
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,857
Well done, Dr. Crane.

498
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:55,167
Back at you, Dr. Sternin.

499
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:57,169
I'd suggest that we try a high five

500
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:59,171
but I recall we attempted that once

501
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:02,163
after a bridge victory and
you scratched my cornea.

502
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:08,480
Well, I guess we shouldn't kee
our dates waiting any longer.

503
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,710
Right.

504
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:15,554
Good luck on your romantic
adventure this evening, Lilith.

505
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:17,256
Don't you
worry--

506
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:18,917
you're going to knock his socks off.

507
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:20,726
Frasier...

508
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:23,593
I don't have a date
anymore. He canceled.

509
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:25,397
You're kidding.

510
00:19:25,397 --> 00:19:27,900
No. I was too proud to admit it to you.

511
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,367
How pathetic is that?

512
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:34,428
Well, there's no need to
beat yourself up about it.

513
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:40,445
Come on. A fake phone
call to "buy time"?

514
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:41,947
It's understandable.

515
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:45,384
Just a face-saving
gesture in the light of...

516
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:47,944
Oh, my God, your date
canceled on you, too.

517
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:49,752
All right, yes.

518
00:19:50,255 --> 00:19:52,246
It's a banner day for both of us.

519
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:55,260
All this lying has certainly
worked up my appetite.

520
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,249
You want to get room service?

521
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:58,263
That might be nice.

522
00:19:58,263 --> 00:19:59,264
Okay.

523
00:19:59,264 --> 00:20:00,754
Certainly beats sitting alone

524
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:03,268
wondering what we missed
out on this evening, hmm?

525
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:05,759
SEAN: Oh, yes! Oh, yes!

526
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:09,331
(loud erotic moaning)

527
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:14,913
Frasier?

528
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:16,403
Hmm? Hmm.

529
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:18,906
Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.

530
00:20:19,418 --> 00:20:21,409
I must have dozed off during the movie.

531
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,921
Me, too.

532
00:20:22,921 --> 00:20:24,411
What time is it?

533
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:26,447
Uh... it's almost 6:00.

534
00:20:26,925 --> 00:20:27,914
6:00?

535
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:29,917
I have a 7:30 flight.

536
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:32,420
Well, I'll just get out of your hair.

537
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:35,423
Listen, Lilith, dinner
was lovely last night.

538
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:36,902
I had a great time.

539
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:39,905
Yes. Well, much better
than those blind dates

540
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,406
could have possibly been.

541
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:43,308
Absolutely.

542
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:45,711
Well, listen, have a
safe trip and all that,

543
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:47,406
and give Freddy a hug for me.

544
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:48,705
I will. All right.

545
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,647
You know, it's funny... What?

546
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,619
Well, I was just thinking
that if we had never met,

547
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:56,288
we're exactly the kind of peopIe

548
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:58,557
that somebody might
set up on a blind date.

549
00:20:58,557 --> 00:21:01,890
You always were one
for droll hypotheticals.

550
00:21:02,327 --> 00:21:04,863
Yes. It's amusing to consider, though.

551
00:21:04,863 --> 00:21:06,865
What would we think of each other

552
00:21:06,865 --> 00:21:09,299
if we were just meeting
now for the first time?

553
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:10,936
But if we hadn't met,
we'd be different people now.

554
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:11,925
Ah, true.

555
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:13,939
But then that raises
many other questions.

556
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:16,341
I mean, what sort of man would
the non-Lilith Frasier be?

557
00:21:16,341 --> 00:21:17,409
What sort of woman...?

558
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:19,400
Did I mention I have a plane to catch?

559
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:20,612
Of course.

560
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:23,315
But you're right.

561
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:25,317
It was a lovely evening.

562
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:29,288
We do have our baggage, don't we?

563
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:32,280
But then sometimes that's what
makes the trip so interesting.

564
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:37,296
With one hand, the
past moves us forward,

565
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,287
and with the other, it holds us back.

566
00:21:44,503 --> 00:21:46,471
Good-bye, Lilith.

567
00:21:46,538 --> 00:21:47,630
Good-bye, Frasier.

568
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:57,578
(door closes)
