1
00:00:09,075 --> 00:00:11,066
(thunder crashing)

2
00:00:16,082 --> 00:00:17,071
(doorbell ringing)

3
00:00:19,586 --> 00:00:21,087
Oh, Niles, thank God
you came quickly.

4
00:00:21,087 --> 00:00:22,589
I've been going mad.

5
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:24,591
This better be a real emergency,
Frasier.

6
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:27,594
You pulled me away
from the Gifted Infant'?
Toy Expo.

7
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:29,596
Yes, yes,
so you missed out on buying

8
00:00:29,596 --> 00:00:30,585
a Tickle Me Tolstoy doll.

9
00:00:31,097 --> 00:00:33,600
Niles, my problem is
more important than that.

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,101
You see, I've...

11
00:00:35,101 --> 00:00:37,103
Oh, dear God!

12
00:00:37,103 --> 00:00:38,605
Niles, I've committed a crime.

13
00:00:38,605 --> 00:00:40,106
Don't tell me...

14
00:00:40,106 --> 00:00:42,609
you forgot to send
the Opera Board a thank you note

15
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:43,598
for the Christmas brickle.

16
00:00:44,077 --> 00:00:46,613
By God, man, it's a real crime
.

17
00:00:46,613 --> 00:00:48,415
Punishable by law!

18
00:00:48,415 --> 00:00:50,212
(thunder crashing)

19
00:00:51,651 --> 00:00:52,719
By law?

20
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,085
Of the United States of America.

21
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:56,722
(thunder crashing)

22
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:00,548
Heavens, what have you done?

23
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:02,262
I'll tell you.

24
00:01:02,262 --> 00:01:04,564
But before you
judge me, Niles, please,

25
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:07,567
remember how much stress
I've been under lately
.

26
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:09,269
Of course.

27
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:11,271
Tell me everything.
Leave nothing out.

28
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:14,138
All right...
It was a dark and stormy day...

29
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:16,843
You can leave that out.

30
00:01:16,843 --> 00:01:18,845
All right.

31
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:20,346
It was an average day,

32
00:01:20,346 --> 00:01:22,348
marred only
by a persistent cough,

33
00:01:22,348 --> 00:01:26,352
caused by a barista's
over-nutmegging my machiatto.

34
00:01:26,352 --> 00:01:27,341
Go ahead, Babette.

35
00:01:27,854 --> 00:01:28,354
What can I do for you?

36
00:01:28,354 --> 00:01:29,844
Well, Dr. Crane,

37
00:01:30,323 --> 00:01:33,781
for about a year now,
I've been... stealing.

38
00:01:34,127 --> 00:01:36,696
I get these uncontrollable urges
to take things.

39
00:01:36,696 --> 00:01:38,198
Such as?

40
00:01:38,198 --> 00:01:40,291
(coughs)

41
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:41,234
All kinds of things.

42
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:42,223
Magazines from stores,

43
00:01:42,535 --> 00:01:43,536
a friend's sunglasses.

44
00:01:43,536 --> 00:01:45,238
Things I don't even want.

45
00:01:45,238 --> 00:01:46,239
I see, um...

46
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:47,240
(clears throat)

47
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,441
Go on.

48
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:49,876
It's just so unlike me.

49
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:51,377
I mean,
my friends think I'm dull.

50
00:01:51,377 --> 00:01:53,880
They all say, "Babette,
you're like an old shoe. "

51
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,381
But stealing is so exciting.

52
00:01:55,381 --> 00:01:57,884
It's really the only time I feel alive.

53
00:01:57,884 --> 00:02:00,386
Well, it sounds to me
like you have a classic case

54
00:02:00,386 --> 00:02:01,375
of klepto--...

55
00:02:01,888 --> 00:02:02,889
(coughing)

56
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:03,890
klepto--...

57
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:04,788
(coughing)

58
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:06,159
Kleptomania.

59
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,895
Hi, Babette.
This is Roz.

60
00:02:08,895 --> 00:02:11,698
And if Dr. Crane weren't
hacking up a hairball,

61
00:02:11,698 --> 00:02:13,199
I'm sure he would tell you

62
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:15,190
that this thrill you get
from stealing

63
00:02:15,702 --> 00:02:17,704
makes up for an emptiness
in your life.

64
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:20,573
That's the problem you
really need to address.

65
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:22,442
So, you should seek counseling

66
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:24,307
or at least find
a support group.

67
00:02:24,577 --> 00:02:26,212
Yes, and may I add...

68
00:02:26,212 --> 00:02:28,281
She's gone and
we're out of time. Oh.

69
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:29,771
Well, then,
this is Dr. Frasier Crane

70
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:32,274
saying "Good day, Seattle,
and good mental health. "

71
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:34,275
Are you okay?

72
00:02:34,787 --> 00:02:36,289
I haven't heard
so much coughing

73
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:38,691
since I was backstage
at Reggae Sunsplash.

74
00:02:38,691 --> 00:02:40,260
Well... (clears throat)...
I'm fine, Roz.

75
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,261
Thank you, thank you so much.

76
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:42,762
Your advice was spot on.

77
00:02:42,762 --> 00:02:44,264
It should be.

78
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:45,765
I've heard you say the
same stuff for ten years now.

79
00:02:45,765 --> 00:02:49,269
"Confront your emotions, "
"communicate, "

80
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:50,497
"seek counseling. "

81
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:52,605
I didn't realize my advice
had become so predictable.

82
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:54,307
Well, it's not
your fault

83
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:56,298
everyone calls with
the same dumb-ass problems.

84
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:59,601
They're not
the same problems.

85
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:01,614
What about
that caller last week--

86
00:03:01,614 --> 00:03:03,616
the sleepwalking transvestite

87
00:03:03,616 --> 00:03:06,619
that kept breaking off his heels
on sewer grates?

88
00:03:06,619 --> 00:03:07,620
I remember him.

89
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,756
You told him to seek counseling.

90
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:11,815
Yes, I also told him
to wear flats.

91
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:14,827
Oh, oh, did
Maintenance remember

92
00:03:14,827 --> 00:03:16,329
to bring me
that hammer I asked for?

93
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:17,330
Oh, yeah, right here.

94
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:18,831
What do you need it for?

95
00:03:18,831 --> 00:03:20,333
Some imbecile's
been parking in my spot

96
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:21,322
despite several
strongly worded notes

97
00:03:21,834 --> 00:03:23,336
I have left on his windshield.

98
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:25,338
The time has come
for me to take matters
into my own hands.

99
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:26,828
NILES:
My God, Frasier,
so that's what you did.

100
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,274
In an uncontrollable rage

101
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:30,643
over the commandeering
of your parking space,

102
00:03:30,643 --> 00:03:31,644
you took hammer to car.

103
00:03:31,644 --> 00:03:33,635
You are a vandal.

104
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:41,719
It was nothing
like that.

105
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:45,725
My reserved sign was a-dangle.

106
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:48,717
I used the hammer
to tack it back up.

107
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,232
I'm sorry.

108
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,734
I didn't realize
this spot was reserved.

109
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:57,237
So all those notes
that I left...

110
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,739
must have...

111
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:02,503
blown away. Hello.

112
00:04:02,775 --> 00:04:03,843
I'm Dr. Frasier Crane.

113
00:04:03,843 --> 00:04:04,832
Yes.

114
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:06,346
So you know my show.

115
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:07,335
It's on your sign.

116
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:10,350
Willa Haver.

117
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:11,851
I'm so sorry.

118
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:13,353
My assigned spot is on the roof,
and with the rain...

119
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:14,843
Oh, no, no,
it's perfectly
understandable.

120
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:18,255
And now that I know
that this is your Audi,

121
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:22,262
let me be the first
to say, "Audi, neighbor. "

122
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,464
NILES:
And that's when

123
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:25,988
she took the hammer
and put you out of your misery.

124
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:29,335
That would have
been preferable.

125
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:31,337
You know, in the
spirit of detente,

126
00:04:31,337 --> 00:04:34,340
I... I could, uh,
buy you some coffee.

127
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,843
Oh, well, that is so sweet
of you,

128
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:38,333
but I can't right now.

129
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:40,647
Well, perhaps tomorrow.

130
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:42,382
Uh, no,
tomorrow's no good either.

131
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:43,683
Next week, perhaps?

132
00:04:43,683 --> 00:04:45,685
Next week
I'll be out of town.

133
00:04:45,685 --> 00:04:46,674
You know, I'm not sure

134
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:48,688
if we're hav
ing a devil of a time

135
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:50,383
coordinating our schedules

136
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:52,385
or if you're giving
me a polite brush-off.

137
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:54,422
(car alarm chirping)

138
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:57,685
Okay.

139
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,697
Now I'm sure.

140
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:10,410
FRASIER:
My morning's travails aside,
Niles,

141
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:11,878
you'll be happy to know

142
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:12,879
I didn't strike out with every woman

143
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:14,369
I encountered today.

144
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:15,381
Frasier...
Hm?

145
00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:17,383
I heard the elevator
and I thought,

146
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:19,886
"I bet that's Frasier,"'
and it is.

147
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:20,887
How are you,
Mrs. Magrini?

148
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:22,889
Oh, just grand

149
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:25,391
and how many times do I have
to ask you to call me Opal?

150
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:26,881
You make me feel
like an old woman.

151
00:05:27,393 --> 00:05:28,461
Opal, then.

152
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:29,762
Lovely to see you again.

153
00:05:29,762 --> 00:05:31,457
Some weather.

154
00:05:32,765 --> 00:05:34,467
Yes, it's just awful.

155
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:37,470
It's blowing a gale.

156
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,472
Yes, it's quite a storm.

157
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:42,771
And colder than
a well-digger's wallet.

158
00:05:44,477 --> 00:05:46,779
Yes, that's quite apt.

159
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:49,782
I wonder
if I could ask a favor.

160
00:05:49,782 --> 00:05:52,785
I know you're probably as busyas an ant farm,

161
00:05:52,785 --> 00:05:56,489
but do you think you could
change a light bulb for me?

162
00:05:56,489 --> 00:05:58,124
The last time I tried,

163
00:05:58,124 --> 00:06:02,028
I fell off the ladder
and I lay on my back like...

164
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,930
Like a helpless turtle?

165
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:08,560
No, like a half hour,
till the ambulance came.

166
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:14,107
Well, um, let me just get out
of these wet shoes

167
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:15,608
and I'll be right over.

168
00:06:15,608 --> 00:06:16,976
Oh, great.

169
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:17,977
I'll make some tea
and cookies.

170
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:21,481
We always have
such lively conversations.

171
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:23,972
Yes, we're reviving a lost art.

172
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:27,987
Hey, Fras.

173
00:06:27,987 --> 00:06:29,978
Some weather, huh?

174
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,992
Yes, it's raining.

175
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:35,483
I've just gone over that
with Mrs. Magrini.

176
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:37,485
Hey, come look at these pictures
from our engagement party.

177
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:41,000
Yeah, that camera you gave me
is terrific.

178
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,503
What, is that the camera
I gave you ten years ago?

179
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:44,970
I can't believe

180
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:45,960
you've never
used it before.

181
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:47,473
Shows you what you know.

182
00:06:47,473 --> 00:06:49,976
Turns out half the shots
on this roll

183
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:51,477
were taken the night
you gave it to me.

184
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:52,979
Niles,

185
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:54,469
come and look
at these old pictures.

186
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:55,970
NILES:
Yes, and then we all looked
at the pictures.

187
00:06:56,482 --> 00:06:58,918
I remember it as if
it were four hours ago.

188
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,909
I am coming to my point.

189
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:02,410
Martin, look at you--

190
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:05,425
sitting in your chair,
all sour and grumpy.

191
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,427
You must be drunk
in this picture, Niles.

192
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,195
You got your arm
around a floor lamp.

193
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:13,029
Oh, no, that's Mar
is in her Easter hat.

194
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:18,538
Why are you all
hunched over in this one?

195
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:21,541
You were looking
at my bum, weren't you?

196
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:22,542
Oh, heavens, no...

197
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:23,531
It's all right, Niles.

198
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:25,044
We're married now.

199
00:07:25,044 --> 00:07:26,534
All right, yes.

200
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:30,015
I might once,
in a moment of weakness,

201
00:07:30,516 --> 00:07:31,881
have permitted myself
a fleeting glance.

202
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,609
Or twice.

203
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,112
Many, many times.

204
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,525
It's all about the rear
with you, isn't it?

205
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:42,595
Darling, let's not...

206
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:44,597
Seriously, what color
are my eyes?

207
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:46,599
You're looking at it
again, aren't you?

208
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:47,834
No, I...

209
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:48,926
Boy, you look
at these pictures

210
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:50,870
.
and you really see
how far we've all come

211
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,572
Oh, I'll say.

212
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:56,576
You were such an old sourpuss,
and you were the Crypt Keeper.

213
00:07:56,576 --> 00:07:57,577
And you, well...

214
00:07:57,577 --> 00:08:01,147
God, you haven'?
changed a bit.

215
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,583
You're even wearing
the same jacket

216
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,084
that you wore
in this picture.

217
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:06,886
It's hardly the same.
I've had it relined.

218
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:08,621
I don't mind telling you
, Niles,

219
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:10,656
what happened next was
particularly galling.

220
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:12,091
I remember exactly
what happened,

221
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:14,093
and I haven't got a clue
what you're talking about.

222
00:08:14,093 --> 00:08:16,662
Our lives
are so complete.

223
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:17,497
We really are lucky.

224
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,965
FRASIER:
Oh, please.

225
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:21,667
That's not
how it happened at all.

226
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,903
Our lives
are so complete.

227
00:08:23,903 --> 00:08:26,929
We really are lucky.

228
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:32,278
Well, come on, Niles.

229
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:35,281
We should be heading off
to the baby show.

230
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:37,283
If we're lucky, we might get
a lead on a nanny.

231
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:39,285
Oh, well, there are ads
in the back of that
Seattle Weekly.

232
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:41,287
RONEE:
Just make sure you look
in the right section.

233
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:43,756
If she says that she's
got her own toys

234
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:46,247
and is willing to spank,
she may not be a nanny.

235
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:47,660
NILES:
Don't tell me

236
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:48,861
in your desperation
over being

237
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,260
the only Crane man
not to find love,

238
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:52,732
you picked up that paper
and did the unthinkable.

239
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:54,734
Tawny LaRue, I presume.

240
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:57,737
FRASIER:
I did no such thing, you nit.

241
00:08:57,737 --> 00:08:59,672
And I am telling
this story.

242
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:02,174
Very slowly.

243
00:09:02,174 --> 00:09:03,903
I'm beginning to think
you didn't do anything.

244
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:05,711
All right,
I'm getting to it.

245
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:08,714
As you recall, I promised to
change my neighbor's light bulb.

246
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:10,204
Oh!

247
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:12,218
Here we are.

248
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,220
I was just admiring
your bust.

249
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,255
Thank you.

250
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:18,958
Might look nice
a little higher.

251
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:22,662
It might look nice
a lot higher,

252
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:24,664
but heck, I'm 83.

253
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:26,962
Anyway, I can'
t thank you enough

254
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:29,669
for coming to my rescue.

255
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:31,671
Yes, it's lucky you ran into m
in the hall.

256
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:34,707
Oh, I knew that would be you
coming out of the elevator.

257
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:36,709
If there's one thing
I can count on,

258
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:39,211
it's old Frasier's routine,

259
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:42,214
unchanging
as Granddad's whiskers.

260
00:09:42,214 --> 00:09:44,216
There's old Frasier

261
00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:45,718
off to work.

262
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:46,719
There's old Frasier
coming home.

263
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:48,721
There's old Frasier
off to work.

264
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:50,723
There's old Frasier...

265
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:52,925
Yes, old Frasier
gets the idea.

266
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:55,758
That's why I gave you
my spare key.

267
00:09:56,295 --> 00:09:57,785
I knew if there was
ever an emergency,

268
00:09:58,297 --> 00:09:59,298
I could count on you.

269
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:01,300
Oh...

270
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,802
we should have our tea.

271
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:05,805
My date's picking me u
p in 20 minutes.

272
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:09,075
How marvelous.
You're still dating.

273
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:12,111
Well, I think an active
social life keeps you young.

274
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:14,671
So, what are you doing
this evening?

275
00:10:14,847 --> 00:10:16,682
I thought I'd stay in
with a good book.

276
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:20,953
Ah, isn't that nice?

277
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:23,723
How you're so cozy
in your routine.

278
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:27,126
You're like
an old shoe, Frasier.

279
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:29,362
That's when I snapped.

280
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:30,829
You didn't.

281
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,833
You bludgeoned her
horribly with that bust!

282
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:36,802
No, you insane twit!

283
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:38,104
You're like
an old shoe, Frasier.

284
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:40,106
Now, come have some tea.

285
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:41,801
FRASIER:
I suddenly flashed
on my caller Babette.

286
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:43,097
Before I knew what I was doing,

287
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:45,111
I impulsively pocketed

288
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:46,812
something
that belonged to her.

289
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:49,115
I stole, Niles.

290
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:50,816
Like some craven thief.

291
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:52,785
.
And I've never felt more alive

292
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:54,252
(thunder crashing)

293
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:03,729
You can't imagine
the thrill I felt

294
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:05,665
as I sat there sipping
her inferior tea

295
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,133
and eating her
excellent cookies,

296
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:10,836
all the while...

297
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:14,829
fingering the stolen
object in my pocket.

298
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:20,780
And then, how
coolly I walked out,

299
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,281
scot-free,

300
00:11:22,281 --> 00:11:25,284
the old bird none the wiser.

301
00:11:25,284 --> 00:11:27,420
What's in there?

302
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,922
Some sort of
decorative medallion.

303
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:31,924
Well, it's pretty clear
what happened.

304
00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:34,415
The depressing series
of events today

305
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:35,884
Ied you to conclude
that you're in a rut.

306
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:38,864
Your spontaneous
transgression generated

307
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:42,368
the excitement that you
so desperately wanted.

308
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:45,360
Any Caribbean-trained psych
student could tell me that.

309
00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:48,274
Well, if you didn't
want my diagnosis,

310
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:50,176
why did you call me here?

311
00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:51,844
I am plagued by guilt.

312
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:53,145
I have to return
this box before

313
00:11:53,145 --> 00:11:54,847
it's discovered missing.

314
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:56,982
Why did you call me here?

315
00:11:56,982 --> 00:11:57,883
I need your help, Niles.

316
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:58,884
I have her key.

317
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:00,374
I know she's out.

318
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:01,875
We can put this back
and be done with it.

319
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:03,389
But I don't want to.

320
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,291
I have excitement in my life.

321
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:06,826
Please!

322
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:08,127
I can't trust myself
to be alone.

323
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:10,129
I am caught in the grip
of this mania.

324
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:11,831
Who knows what
I might steal next?

325
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:13,499
You took a little box.

326
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:16,969
I hardly think you're gonna
run off on a crime spree.

327
00:12:16,969 --> 00:12:17,958
Oh, really?

328
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:21,061
Thief!

329
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:24,076
That's right.

330
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:27,068
I took it, and I liked it.

331
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,782
Please. Please, Niles.

332
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:30,783
I don't want to get involved.

333
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:32,084
Fine!
I'll do it myself.

334
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:33,085
Here, hold
this for me.
What for?

335
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:34,787
Now your prints
are on it, too.

336
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:35,788
You have to help me.

337
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:36,777
(grunts)

338
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:49,935
Admit it, Niles.

339
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:51,771
It's intoxicating,
isn't it?

340
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:55,541
Can't you feel a tingle
running down your spine?

341
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:57,042
In a minute it's
going to be running

342
00:12:57,042 --> 00:13:00,045
down my inseam.
Hurry up.

343
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:02,548
I've become a danger junkie.

344
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:06,051
A cunning cat burglar
with nerves of steel.

345
00:13:06,051 --> 00:13:07,052
(rattling)

346
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:08,041
(shrieks)

347
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:11,045
Hide. Hide! Here, here.
Take this box.

348
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:12,046
No, no, you've
got a pocket.

349
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:13,547
Put it...

350
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:16,428
All right, everybody.

351
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:17,930
Put down your gifts.

352
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:19,932
Give me your coats and
I'll put them in the bedroom.

353
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:20,933
(phone rings)

354
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:21,934
Hello?

355
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:23,435
Thank you.

356
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:24,937
Okay, that was the doorman.

357
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:26,438
Aunt Opal is on her way up.

358
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:27,928
Everyone find a place to hide.

359
00:13:31,443 --> 00:13:32,933
All right,
quiet, everybody.

360
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:34,434
I hear them.

361
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:40,553
ALL:
Surprise!

362
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:43,044
OPAL:
Oh, my goodness!

363
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:45,591
Oh, you! Oh!

364
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:48,082
Frasier?

365
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:50,527
Who are you?

366
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:52,998
I'm Dr. Frasier Crane,
the next-door neighbor,

367
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:54,500
and this is
my brother Niles.

368
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,235
We just want to say
Happy birthday, Opal.

369
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:57,970
Thank you.

370
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:58,938
Did someone invite you?

371
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:00,940
Uh, well, news
of this birthday

372
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,237
has been just buzzing
through the building.

373
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:03,943
We wouldn't miss an opportunity

374
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:04,944
to honor this
wonderful lady.

375
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:06,241
But how'd you get in here?

376
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:07,947
We slipped in as
the door was closing.

377
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:09,448
I could swear...

378
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:11,450
Stop grilling them,
please, Roland.

379
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:13,452
He thinks he has
to grill everyone

380
00:14:13,452 --> 00:14:16,046
.
just because
he's a district attorney

381
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:20,926
Now, what would
you like to drink?

382
00:14:20,926 --> 00:14:22,294
Champagne.

383
00:14:22,294 --> 00:14:24,964
Well, we really
can't stay.

384
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:26,298
Oh, you can stay a few minutes.

385
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:27,967
You don't want
to hurt my feelings.

386
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:28,968
Let me
take your coat.

387
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:30,302
Oh, my coat,
no, I'd really

388
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:31,303
rather you...
Uh... Okay.

389
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:32,972
Oh, my God.

390
00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:34,039
What? What?!

391
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:36,075
You're
Dr. Frasier Crane.

392
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:38,077
Here, take this, Roland.

393
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:40,079
I love your show.

394
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,247
be
Oh...
It's going to

395
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:43,916
so exciting to have
a celebrity here

396
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:46,919
when we take Aunt Opal'?
picture with her medal.

397
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:47,953
Medal?

398
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:49,250
She won the bronze

399
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:53,459
at the 1 936
Berlin Olympics.

400
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:55,461
So what's it like
being a huge radio star?

401
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:56,962
Frasier...

402
00:14:56,962 --> 00:14:58,464
Yes, yes,
in a minute, Niles.

403
00:14:58,464 --> 00:15:01,967
Actually, I don't really
think of myself

404
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:04,970
as a star,
so much as a healer.

405
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:05,959
The important thing
is to listen.

406
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:06,961
Frasier.

407
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:08,474
Not now, Niles.

408
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:09,975
Frasier, they're
going to take

409
00:15:09,975 --> 00:15:11,477
her picture
with her medal.

410
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:13,479
Yes, I heard that.

411
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:14,480
Oh, dear.

412
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,981
Uh, excuse me
just a moment.

413
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:17,983
You've got to get that
medal out of your coat.

414
00:15:17,983 --> 00:15:19,184
Why don't you get it?

415
00:15:19,184 --> 00:15:20,519
I'm a celebrity.

416
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:22,521
They're watching
my every move. Go on.

417
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:25,024
Aunt Opal, tell Dr.
Crane the story

418
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:28,027
about how you refused
to shake Hitler's hand

419
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:30,195
when he gave
you that medal.

420
00:15:30,195 --> 00:15:33,790
It looked sweaty,
that's all.

421
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:04,129
Who are you?

422
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:06,398
It's just a dream.

423
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:10,095
Then why aren't
you Harry Truman?

424
00:16:12,037 --> 00:16:13,138
Where's my cake?

425
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:14,640
I'm ready
for the cake.

426
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,142
No, not until we take
the family picture, Mother.

427
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:19,042
I got it.

428
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:20,279
Then let's take
the darned picture.

429
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:21,268
Roland, get my medal down.

430
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:22,269
Where is it?

431
00:16:22,781 --> 00:16:24,078
Same place it
always is,

432
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:28,287
unless it's grown legs
like a tadpole and hopped away.

433
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:30,222
We have got to get
that medal up there.

434
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:31,211
We?
You're right.

435
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:33,225
Bad plan. You've got
to get it up there.

436
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:35,127
All right, top shelf,
right of the sconce.

437
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:37,763
You know, before
we take the picture,

438
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:40,766
I have a little story
I'd like to tell

439
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:43,769
that just may rival
that Hitler tale.

440
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:44,770
(laughing)

441
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:49,274
The place...
was right here.

442
00:16:49,274 --> 00:16:53,142
The time was
this afternoon.

443
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:55,080
Opal had just set out

444
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:59,084
a lovely service of tea
and a plate of sweets.

445
00:16:59,084 --> 00:17:04,790
I remember there were three
cookies sitting on the plate

446
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:07,884
and I reached
for the left one.

447
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:12,197
Not the center one,

448
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:14,188
the left one, and...

449
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:18,203
Just at
the same moment,

450
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:20,205
Opal reached for
the very same cookie.

451
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:22,196
Oh, what did you
say, Opal?

452
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:23,709
It was priceless.

453
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,712
"
.
I said, 'you take it

454
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,202
Right off the
top of her head.

455
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:31,373
What are you doing?

456
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:35,654
I can tell from the panic
in my brother's voice

457
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:37,656
that he, he must
have seen a spider.

458
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:39,658
You see, he has a,
a crippling fear

459
00:17:39,658 --> 00:17:42,161
of spiders and it
sent him up the ladder.

460
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:44,530
Yes. I hate spiders.

461
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:45,394
I don't see a spider.

462
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:46,732
Come back down.

463
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,133
No!
Why not?

464
00:17:48,133 --> 00:17:50,636
Because he also has
a crippling fear of heights

465
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:52,137
and this may be
just the breakthrough

466
00:17:52,137 --> 00:17:53,627
we've been looking for.
Higher, Niles.

467
00:17:54,139 --> 00:17:55,140
Conquer your fear.

468
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:58,343
Please, everyone,

469
00:17:58,343 --> 00:18:01,180
I'm going to have
to ask you to turn around,

470
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:03,515
as his fear
of crowds has set in.

471
00:18:03,515 --> 00:18:05,107
Crowds, too?

472
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:06,473
Yes. You are looking
at that rarest of beasts--

473
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:07,786
the arachno-acro-agoraphobe.

474
00:18:07,786 --> 00:18:09,219
Please, avert your eyes.

475
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:10,744
.
Oh. Oh

476
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:13,459
This is the most
difficult part of the process.

477
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:15,256
I am using a
technique known

478
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:17,329
as behavioral
exposure therapy.

479
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:19,331
Climb higher, Niles.

480
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:20,332
Ever higher.

481
00:18:20,332 --> 00:18:21,133
Conquer your fear.

482
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:22,668
Wow. Frasier
Crane in action.

483
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:23,669
No, please.

484
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:25,170
No peeking.

485
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:26,660
You don't want
to cause a setback.

486
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:31,110
Everybody freeze!

487
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,101
This is the moment
of truth.

488
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:36,170
I haven't done this
since my days in med school.

489
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:44,690
Hurrah!

490
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:46,692
He's done it!

491
00:18:46,692 --> 00:18:48,182
He's conquered all three!

492
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:53,265
What are you doing?

493
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:54,266
Well, you as an athlete

494
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:55,756
should know the...
the time-honored tradition

495
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:57,758
of hoisting the victor
on one's shoulders.

496
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,139
They never did that to me.

497
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:03,208
Well, you finished third,
didn't you?

498
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:05,577
Now, if
you'll excuse me,

499
00:19:05,577 --> 00:19:08,580
I've got to journal all this
while it's still fresh.

500
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:11,583
Good night, everyone.

501
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:12,584
Oh.

502
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:15,220
Good Lord, I
should have dipped.

503
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,221
go.
Yes, there we

504
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:17,210
Ooh!

505
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:19,284
So sorry.

506
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,501
Oh, hey, Dad.

507
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:31,170
I didn't know
you guys were here.

508
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,159
Where's Ronee?

509
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:33,994
Oh, she's in bed waiting for me.

510
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,509
Hey, know what?

511
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:39,011
She can't see a thing
without her contacts.

512
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:40,445
Why don't we play
a little joke on her?

513
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:42,936
You tiptoe in...
No, Dad, I'll pass.

514
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:47,519
Still looking at those
old pictures, huh?

515
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:48,854
Yeah.

516
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,378
It's funny, isn't it?

517
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:51,645
What?

518
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:54,293
How suddenly
your whole life can change.

519
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:57,696
p
I never would have dreamed
back then that I'd end u

520
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:59,665
getting married again,
at my age,

521
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:03,302
and to someone
so young and full of pep.

522
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:05,470
I'm very happy
for you and Ronee.

523
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:08,273
That's the way it is.

524
00:20:08,273 --> 00:20:10,309
Just when you think
that you're in a rut

525
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:13,312
and nothing exciting will ever
happen to you again...

526
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:16,014
Pow. That's when it does.

527
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:18,450
Maybe you're right.

528
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:20,350
I know I'm right.

529
00:20:23,288 --> 00:20:24,289
Good night, Fras.

530
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:26,280
Good night, Dad.

531
00:20:30,295 --> 00:20:32,286
You know, you could put on
my robe and a little bit

532
00:20:32,664 --> 00:20:34,655
of my Aqua Velva.
Good night, Dad.
