1
00:00:09,042 --> 00:00:10,532
What's got Daphne all worked up now?

2
00:00:11,211 --> 00:00:12,479
It wasn't Daphne.

3
00:00:12,479 --> 00:00:14,014
It was Maris.

4
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,248
She's gotten involved

5
00:00:15,248 --> 00:00:17,250
with some Argentine polo player.

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,047
It turns out he's a gold digger

7
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:21,050
with a violent temper to boot.

8
00:00:21,254 --> 00:00:22,355
Dr. Crane? Yes?

9
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:24,050
I'm Esteban di Rojo.

10
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:28,061
I tell you, Maris will
never come between us again.

11
00:00:28,061 --> 00:00:29,362
MAN: And now, news headlines.

12
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:33,033
Police have just arrested
Seattle socialite Maris Crane

13
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:36,730
for the murder of her lover,
polo star Esteban di Rojo.

14
00:00:39,105 --> 00:00:40,140
Oh, come in.

15
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,630
Niles. What have you heard?

16
00:00:42,108 --> 00:00:43,598
Not much. The TV news
is still pretty sketchy.

17
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:45,111
Dad, did you find anything out?

18
00:00:45,111 --> 00:00:47,113
I called some buddies at the station.

19
00:00:47,113 --> 00:00:48,114
They'll call back when
they know something.

20
00:00:48,114 --> 00:00:50,116
DAPHNE: It's just so freaky.

21
00:00:50,116 --> 00:00:51,618
I can't believe that man is dead.

22
00:00:51,618 --> 00:00:53,609
He was standing right where
you are just a few hours ago.

23
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,121
How you holding up, son?

24
00:00:55,121 --> 00:00:57,624
As well as can be expected.

25
00:00:57,624 --> 00:00:59,626
I meant your brother.

26
00:00:59,626 --> 00:01:02,128
Oh, well, I'm-I'm stunned, of course.

27
00:01:02,128 --> 00:01:05,632
The idea that-that Maris
actually killed someone...

28
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:08,624
Well, we've all seen her murder
many a lively dinner party.

29
00:01:09,169 --> 00:01:10,570
That's terrible. Frasier.

30
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,572
Oh, come on. I'm joking,

31
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:14,563
and haven't I earned a
right to my gallows humor?

32
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:17,277
After all, are you forgetting
that just this afternoon

33
00:01:17,277 --> 00:01:21,145
I was punched in the
face by a man now dead?

34
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:24,678
Thank you.

35
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:25,482
Here, drink this.

36
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:27,187
Oh, thanks.

37
00:01:27,187 --> 00:01:29,189
(phone ringing)

38
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:30,178
NILES: Hello.

39
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:32,492
This is he.

40
00:01:32,492 --> 00:01:34,494
Yes, of course.

41
00:01:34,494 --> 00:01:37,197
Uh, I'll be there shortly.

42
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:38,465
It's the police.

43
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:40,200
They want to talk to me.

44
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,201
My God, why? They don't suspect you

45
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:42,502
of anything, do they?

46
00:01:42,502 --> 00:01:43,503
I don't think so.

47
00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:44,504
I don't think they could.

48
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:46,206
They couldn't, could
they? Dad ? . Calm down.

49
00:01:46,206 --> 00:01:47,507
You had lunch with her today.

50
00:01:47,507 --> 00:01:49,142
They just want to know
what you talked about.

51
00:01:49,142 --> 00:01:50,443
What did we talk about?
What did we talk about?

52
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:52,206
Uh, let's see. Well...

53
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:54,504
We-we discussed the upcoming
women's arts festival

54
00:01:55,215 --> 00:01:56,204
and their tableaux vivant.

55
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:59,212
They're going to be re-enactin
Schmitt's painting of

56
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:02,215
"The Martyrdom of St.
Ursula by Attila the Hun. "

57
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:05,225
Naturally, Maris will pose as the Hun.

58
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:06,419
Ah.

59
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:07,794
A tad dramatic for my taste,

60
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:09,796
but nonetheless, I told her I'd help out

61
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,297
by lending her my antique crossbow

62
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:13,231
to help complete the
tragic scene on the Rhone.

63
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:14,701
Of course, talk of the Rhone

64
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:16,669
inevitably led to
that wonderful anecdote

65
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:19,672
about the Nazarene painters
of Biddlespock Palace.

66
00:02:19,672 --> 00:02:21,674
(guffaws) : Those beer-loving rascals.

67
00:02:21,674 --> 00:02:23,176
Tell it, Niles.

68
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:24,165
No!

69
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:28,170
What did she say about the polo guy?

70
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:30,350
Well, I-I told you,
she-she mentioned

71
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,351
she felt unsafe around him

72
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:33,353
and that she thought he only wanted her

73
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:35,622
for her money, and I urged
her to end the relationship.

74
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:37,624
 Well, that's pretty tame stuff

75
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:39,319
It'll take more than a little lunch

76
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:41,227
to tie you into a murder.

77
00:02:41,227 --> 00:02:44,631
Oh, dear. Niles, they're in
front of Maris' house now.

78
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:47,467
...startling new development
in the society murder case.

79
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:49,836
Sources say alleged murderer

80
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:53,239
Maris Crane killed her polo
- playing lover, Esteban di Rojo,

81
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:54,638
with an antique crossbow.

82
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:04,217
You gave her the murder weapon.

83
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:07,209
(telephone ringing)

84
00:03:11,224 --> 00:03:12,725
Hello?

85
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:14,227
It's a reporter.

86
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:15,728
I'm not here.

87
00:03:15,728 --> 00:03:17,230
 I'm sorry, he's not here

88
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:20,233
and I don't know when he's coming back.

89
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:23,403
I'd rather not say.

90
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:25,538
I'd rather not say!

91
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:28,241
Oh, thank you. Manchester, actually.

92
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:29,230
Hang up.

93
00:03:29,342 --> 00:03:30,410
Good-bye.

94
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:31,678
NILES: I don't believe this.

95
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:33,446
It's an unlisted number.

96
00:03:33,446 --> 00:03:35,448
They must think I'm involved somehow.

97
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:37,450
Th-they're actually
trying to imply that...

98
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:39,953
(gasping)

99
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:42,956
No, no, no, I'm not going to panic.

100
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:45,356
The only way to get through
this is to remain calm.

101
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:47,584
Right. Now, let's go
on down to the station

102
00:03:48,294 --> 00:03:49,596
and get this all sorted out.

103
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:50,597
I'm coming, too.

104
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:52,298
No. You have to rest up

105
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:54,300
for our doctor's
appointment tomorrow morning.

106
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,289
I'll stay with Daphne.

107
00:03:55,602 --> 00:03:56,603
NILES: Don't worry.

108
00:03:56,603 --> 00:03:59,305
Everything is going to be fine.

109
00:03:59,305 --> 00:04:01,296
(telephone ringing)

110
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:07,247
You know, that's going
to go on all night.

111
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,236
You want to just stay at my place?

112
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:10,984
Thanks, but if I let them
drive me out of me own home,

113
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:11,985
then they've won.

114
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:12,986
(phone ringing)

115
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:15,488
Allow me.

116
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,890
Hello?

117
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:19,792
I see.

118
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:21,461
Yes, I'll tell her.

119
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:23,326
Your mother heard the
news. She's on her way over.

120
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,440
Well, we survived.

121
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,942
The kid held up.

122
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,443
What took you all night?

123
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:38,945
Oh, there was a lot of waiting.

124
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:39,946
Here, let me take your jacket.

125
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:40,935
Thank you.

126
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:44,450
Fortunately, we found
a nice, cold metal bench

127
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,452
between two drunk bikers

128
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:49,444
and a pimp who called me Peaches.

129
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:50,957
Yeah, and the interesting thing

130
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,458
happened when we were leaving.

131
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,449
We ran into Maris'
lawyer on the way out.

132
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,462
And he told us the whole story.

133
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:58,965
Apparently Maris and
Esteban had a fight,

134
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,466
and Maris kicked him out.

135
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:02,969
She was trying to calm
herself by practicing

136
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,470
her tableaux vivant pose

137
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:05,972
with the... with the crossbow,

138
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,974
which she needs all the
practice she can get.

139
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,475
She has terribly weak triceps.

140
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:12,979
Well, all of a sudden,
Esteban burst back in

141
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:15,481
through the balcony window.

142
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:17,483
Maris was-was startled to death

143
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:19,485
and pulled the trigger in self-defense.

144
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:21,976
He was dead before he hit the parquet.

145
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:25,048
So where is she now?

146
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:27,015
They're holding her as a flight risk.

147
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,528
Can you imagine?

148
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:30,996
Well, it didn't help
that when they found her

149
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:33,466
she had a passport, a wig
and $ 10, 000 in her purse.

150
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:37,036
Maris always has those
things in her purse.

151
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:39,038
Well, you've got to admit, Niles,

152
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:40,471
it doesn't look very good.

153
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,098
I can't believe she
could have planned this.

154
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:44,098
You do learn something about a woman

155
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,601
when you've slept in the room
next to hers for 1 5 years.

156
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:50,616
(thump)

157
00:05:50,616 --> 00:05:52,385
Oh, that must be the paper.

158
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:53,545
So she just happened

159
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:55,521
to be posing with a loaded crossbow

160
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:57,523
the exact moment he burst in on her?

161
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:59,525
And don't you just know the prosecutor

162
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:01,928
is going to try to twist
that into something sinister?

163
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:04,430
FRASIER: Oh, dear.

164
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:05,419
It's on the front page.

165
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:07,867
They don't mention Niles, do they?

166
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:08,868
Let me see...

167
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:09,732
Ah, here we are, yes, uh,

168
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:11,404
"Maris Crane is believed

169
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:13,406
"to have gotten the
crossbow from her ex-husband,

170
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:14,707
"Dr. Niles Crane, with whom she lunched

171
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:16,937
on the day of the murder. "

172
00:06:17,176 --> 00:06:19,445
Is that you and Maris on your honeymoon?

173
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:23,750
Uh, that is the experimental
liposuction center in Gestaad.

174
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,445
So, yes.

175
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:29,555
"According to sources,
Crane divorced the accused

176
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:31,546
"some years ago to
marry her plastic surgeon

177
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:36,051
"whom he left in order
to marry... " Oh, dear.

178
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:40,566
"To marry Daphne Moon, a housekeeper. "

179
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:42,068
Oh, that's just lovely.

180
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,069
Now, now, now, now.

181
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,571
The press is notorious
for getting things wrong.

182
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:47,073
(chuckling) : Yes. Niles is right.

183
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,574
For-for example, look.

184
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:51,077
Further on here, it-it says, (chuckles)

185
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:54,080
"Dr. Crane is the brother
of local deejay Frazer--

186
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,515
with a 'Z'--
Crane. "

187
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:58,084
You just have to laugh these things off.

188
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,952
(laughing)

189
00:06:59,952 --> 00:07:01,621
Well, I can't laugh.

190
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:02,610
That horrible woman has managed

191
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,924
to slither her way back into our lives.

192
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:06,626
No, she is not back in our life.

193
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:07,923
This whole thing is going
to blow over in no time.

194
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:09,629
How can you be so calm?

195
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:11,664
Well, in situations such as this,

196
00:07:11,664 --> 00:07:12,653
there are only two ways to react.

197
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,634
Either you go to
pieces or you stay calm,

198
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:16,202
and I've chosen to do the latter.

199
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:17,794
Bravo, Niles. That's very healthy.

200
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:19,806
Yeah. Well, better go home, son.

201
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:21,501
Get some sleep. You've had a long night.

202
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:22,537
That is a good idea.

203
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:23,503
 I'll call you later.

204
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:24,811
All right. Thank you.

205
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:28,514
Oh. We have your doctor'
s appointment this morning.

206
00:07:28,514 --> 00:07:29,674
Oh, don't worry, you don't have to come.

207
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:32,118
Oh? And miss hearing
my baby's heartbeat?

208
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,119
I don't think so.

209
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,620
Besides, I'll be fine.

210
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,611
Plenty of time to sleep
after the baby's born.

211
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:44,664
ROZ: How you holding up?

212
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:47,133
Apart from the lack of
sleep, I'm all right,

213
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,135
although, now that it's in the news

214
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:51,137
that I provided the
crossbow, I can't go anywhere

215
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:53,128
without people whispering and pointing.

216
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:54,640
(phone ringing)

217
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,130
Oh, excuse me.

218
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:58,644
Hello?

219
00:07:58,644 --> 00:07:59,633
Hello, Maris.

220
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:03,015
Oh, I'm-I'm so sorry.

221
00:08:03,015 --> 00:08:04,517
Yes, that's awful.

222
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:07,019
can. I'll-I'll-I'll
do what I

223
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:08,020
Yes, all right.

224
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:10,022
Oh, that was Maris.

225
00:08:10,022 --> 00:08:12,513
Poor thing lost her shoes.

226
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:19,031
She put them outside her
cell to be polished, and...

227
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:22,023
someone named Big Judy is
holding them for ransom.

228
00:08:22,568 --> 00:08:24,036
FRASIER: Well, I...

229
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:26,038
how often does she call you?

230
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:28,040
Uh, more often than
you'd think she could,

231
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,543
being in jail.

232
00:08:30,543 --> 00:08:32,545
Hasn't she made your life hard enough?

233
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:34,547
Oh, I can't turn my
back on her now, Roz.

234
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:36,549
She's literally fighting for her life.

235
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:38,039
Oh, wonderful.

236
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:39,552
More news vans.

237
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:41,543
Maybe it's time I made a statement.

238
00:08:42,054 --> 00:08:43,043
Absolutely not, Niles.

239
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:45,057
That is the worst possible
thing you could do.

240
00:08:45,057 --> 00:08:47,548
It would only fan the
flames. I'll tell you what.

241
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:49,562
, Why don't you slip out the back way

242
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:51,063
and I will talk to them for you.

243
00:08:51,063 --> 00:08:53,065
 Oh, that's... there's no need, Frasier

244
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:54,567
No, Niles, I insist.

245
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:56,569
I'm used to dealing
with these media jackals.

246
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:58,059
You have no idea how
they can twist your words

247
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:00,072
with editing tricks and such. All right.

248
00:09:00,072 --> 00:09:01,073
Off you go.

249
00:09:01,073 --> 00:09:02,074
Thank you, Frasier.

250
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:04,076
Is Niles Crane in here?

251
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:05,077
He is not.

252
00:09:05,077 --> 00:09:06,579
I will be speaking on his behalf.

253
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:08,570
Gentlemen, you may roll tape.

254
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:15,087
Good afternoon, Seattle.

255
00:09:15,087 --> 00:09:18,955
This is Dr. Frasier Crane,
spokesman for the Crane family.

256
00:09:19,158 --> 00:09:22,728
Recent events involving
my brother, Niles Crane,

257
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:24,730
and his ex-wife are tragic...

258
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:28,734
almost as tragic as the
rampant media speculation

259
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:31,237
concerning his involvement.

260
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:34,674
If there is any justice in the world,

261
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:37,666
Maris Crane and Niles
Crane will soon be executed.

262
00:09:38,177 --> 00:09:39,667
Thank you. That is all I have to say.

263
00:09:42,682 --> 00:09:43,683
I said no such thing.

264
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:44,684
I did? I did?

265
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:46,675
Excuse me. Excuse me. Come back.

266
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:53,092
FRASIER (over TV): Maris
Crane and Niles Crane

267
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:55,060
will soon be executed.

268
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:56,921
That's four times in one newscast.

269
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:59,732
Must be some kind of record.

270
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:02,792
They know I meant exonerated. (groans)

271
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,605
FRASIER: Oh, Daphne, Niles!

272
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:09,609
Listen, I'm, I'm so sorry
about today's little gaffe

273
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:10,876
You know what I meant.

274
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:11,877
Oh, don't worry.

275
00:10:11,877 --> 00:10:12,878
Anyone can make a little slip.

276
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:15,369
We know you were only
trying to ruin our lives.

277
00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:17,371
I mean, help.

278
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:21,387
Niles, once again, I'm so sorry.

279
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:22,888
No, no, Frasier, please, it's all right.

280
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:24,290
I should have talked to them myself.

281
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,780
I hope it'll be all right

282
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:27,787
if we stay with you for a while.

283
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:28,992
Why? What happened?

284
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,863
Well, since Frasier's
little press conference,

285
00:10:30,863 --> 00:10:32,365
the media frenzy's only increased.

286
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:34,367
It's become a nuisance
for our neighbors.

287
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:37,870
TV crews and news helicopters,
plus the entire press corps

288
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:40,873
from Esteban's hometown in Argentina.

289
00:10:40,873 --> 00:10:43,876
Last night some cheeky bloke
from the Buenos Aires Herald

290
00:10:43,876 --> 00:10:45,878
climbed a tree and took a picture

291
00:10:45,878 --> 00:10:47,869
of old Mrs Gotschalk in her sitz bath.

292
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:51,784
Apparently, the readership of the Herald

293
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:54,275
is mostly lonely gauchos.

294
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:56,186
FRASIER: You know, Niles,

295
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:58,824
your good cheer in spite of everything

296
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:00,026
is just remarkable.

297
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:02,194
Well, I've chosen not
to let it get to me,

298
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:03,696
and it hasn't.

299
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:05,698
Of course, much of the
credit goes to my Daphne.

300
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:11,203
I-I'm so truly blessed to have
such a loving and supportive wife.

301
00:11:11,203 --> 00:11:14,707
She is at once my
huggle-bunny and my rock.

302
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:17,209
I think I might throw up.

303
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:19,211
Huggle-bunny was a bit much.

304
00:11:19,211 --> 00:11:21,080
No, no, my stomach, it's upset.

305
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,415
Well, Daphne, can I get you something?

306
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:23,416
Oh, thank you, Frasier.

307
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,418
I wouldn't mind ten years in prison.

308
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:26,908
Oh, I meant crackers.

309
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:38,964
Well, I-I guess I deserve
that, but, uh, may I remind you,

310
00:11:38,964 --> 00:11:42,268
 I'm a bit of a victim myself..

311
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:47,773
as just yesterday I was
punched in the face by a man...

312
00:11:47,773 --> 00:11:49,001
now dead.

313
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:51,901
Thank you.

314
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:55,037
(phone rings)

315
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:00,481
Hello.

316
00:12:00,986 --> 00:12:03,477
Hello... Mmm.

317
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:06,980
No, no, I haven't forgotten.

318
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:09,929
Yes, I'll try to get
the re tomorrow morning.

319
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:12,420
All right, good-bye, Mmm...

320
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:17,937
That was Maris, wasn't it?

321
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:19,302
Where will you be tomorrow morning?

322
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:23,803
The jail. I-I-I said
I'd try to visit her.

323
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:26,045
Have you lost your bloody mind?!

324
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:27,813
I have tried to be patient,

325
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:29,110
but this is too much!

326
00:12:29,815 --> 00:12:31,817
You promised me that woman
would be out of our lives.

327
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:33,119
, Now she's calling every minute

328
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:35,110
the papers report as though
you two are still married,

329
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:37,823
and I can't even sleep in my own bed!

330
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:39,125
I know, darling, b-but
you can't blame me

331
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,359
for everything that's happened

332
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:41,519
The hell I can't!

333
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:43,886
If you hadn't snuck off
to have lunch with her,

334
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:45,998
we never would have
been dragged into this,

335
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:48,501
and you wouldn't be sleeping
alone on the couch tonight.

336
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:50,366
But you did, and we were, so you are!

337
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:53,794
I hate that kind of cracker!

338
00:12:57,843 --> 00:12:58,901
That was kind of harsh.

339
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:00,007
FRASIER: I'll say.

340
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:01,937
These are imported from Belgium.

341
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,417
Poor thing.

342
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:07,920
She's overtired and a little hormonal.

343
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,412
I'll, I'll go try to talk
her into choosing to be calm.

344
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:14,892
Boy, he's really holding up well.

345
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:16,252
A little too well.

346
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:17,930
I'm starting to fear

347
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:19,932
he's not dealing with
his emotions at all.

348
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:20,921
Right.

349
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:23,936
That's the whole secret to holding up.

350
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:27,940
Dad, it's called "repression
, "and it is not healthy.

351
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,942
The man is a walking pressure cooker.

352
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:31,239
It's his senior year

353
00:13:31,944 --> 00:13:32,933
all over again.

354
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:35,936
What are you talking about?

355
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:38,250
Oh, that's right.

356
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,252
He swore me to secrecy.

357
00:13:40,252 --> 00:13:41,241
Well...

358
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:46,959
Niles got mono.

359
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,829
He missed four weeks of class, right?

360
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,130
So, he was studying around the clock,

361
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:52,825
trying to catch up.

362
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:56,862
Just before finals, his
girlfriend dumped him

363
00:13:57,136 --> 00:13:58,037
for his roommate.

364
00:13:58,037 --> 00:13:59,972
Niles insisted he was just fine

365
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:01,941
right up until the very moment

366
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:03,475
when they found him in
the all-night grocery,

367
00:14:03,475 --> 00:14:05,978
sitting in a freezer bin,

368
00:14:05,978 --> 00:14:08,469
talking to a bag of frozen corn...

369
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:12,974
whispering, "Why so cold, my love?"

370
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:17,613
All calm.

371
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:25,086
Want me to help you make up the couch?

372
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:27,099
No, no. I can manage.

373
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:30,091
 Okay. Well, I think
I'll hit the rack, too

374
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:33,105
Sherry, Niles?

375
00:14:33,105 --> 00:14:34,607
Oh, how lovely.

376
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:35,471
Thank you.

377
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:36,339
Mmm.

378
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,043
To the balcony?

379
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:39,340
Mm, after you.

380
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:47,353
Niles, while I admire
your initial fortitude,

381
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:49,355
I can't help thinking
you may have taken things

382
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:52,057
to extremes.

383
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:55,060
As you know, it can be dangerous
to repress one's emotions.

384
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,363
Ah, true, but there is no way

385
00:14:57,363 --> 00:14:59,064
of weathering a situation like this

386
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:00,366
without a certain degree of detachment.

387
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:02,167
Are you sure you're not too detached?

388
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:03,168
Oh, nonsense.

389
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:05,170
Everything's under control.

390
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,171
Oh, look at that.

391
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:08,674
What in the hell?!

392
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:10,676
Just a news chopper!

393
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:12,177
Pay it no mind!

394
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:13,679
(shouting): That doesn't bother you?!

395
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:15,670
You get used to it!

396
00:15:16,181 --> 00:15:18,183
Oh, for heaven's sake!

397
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:19,548
Get inside!

398
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:24,390
You should be ashamed of yourselves.

399
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:28,087
You know perfectly well
I meant "exonerated"!

400
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:33,499
Hello, Roz.

401
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:35,000
Hi, Niles.

402
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,991
A cappuccino, please. And one for him.

403
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:38,470
You don't look so good.

404
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:41,006
I didn't get much sleep last nightagain.

405
00:15:41,006 --> 00:15:44,009
I'm surprised you're
here after yesterday.

406
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:46,011
I refuse to be cowed
into changing my routine.

407
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:47,000
Let me get this.

408
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:48,981
I have my coffee, I go to work.

409
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:51,973
Of course, all my patients
want to talk about is Maris.

410
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:54,475
Esteban's crazed brother
left me a message,

411
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:57,489
saying I owe some sort of blood debt.

412
00:15:57,489 --> 00:15:59,980
Some days it just doesn't
pay to get off the sofa.

413
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:03,985
You've had it pretty rough.

414
00:16:04,496 --> 00:16:05,497
What are my choices?

415
00:16:05,497 --> 00:16:07,499
I can go to pieces, or I can bear up

416
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:08,488
and live my normal life.

417
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:09,990
Can I get a straw, please?

418
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:12,495
Oh, sorry, sir, that was the last one.

419
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:17,438
I see.

420
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:22,136
The last straw.

421
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:27,453
Gosh, is it warm in here?

422
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:30,155
 It is. It is. It's warm in here.

423
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:31,457
Oh, it's suffocating.

424
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:32,458
That's better.

425
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:34,159
I'll get you a straw, Niles.

426
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,160
Do you need a straw?

427
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,161
No, no, no. You heard her.

428
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:37,463
There are no more straws.

429
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:42,162
Oh, that feels so much better.

430
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:47,072
Oh, everything was just
so tight before. Aah!

431
00:16:47,072 --> 00:16:49,575
(straining): Yes! Oh!

432
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:53,278
Coffee shop without straws?

433
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:54,313
(giggling)

434
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:56,304
It makes no sense.

435
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,019
You can borrow my straw, see?

436
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,021
Oh, this is great.

437
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,322
I was being smothered.

438
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:04,323
Oh, I can breathe!

439
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:06,018
I don't know how you stand it.

440
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:10,029
Hello, Frasier? It's me.

441
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,327
How close are you to the cafe?

442
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,034
All right, well, hurry up and park,

443
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,332
because Niles is almost completely...

444
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,337
Niles is completely naked.

445
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,343
Oh... Niles.

446
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,351
I'm calling the cops.

447
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:33,215
The hell you are.

448
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:35,554
This man's tips alone have probably paid

449
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:37,456
for all the pot you'll ever smoke.

450
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:39,491
Just back off, cowboy.

451
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:41,482
And that goes for the rest of you, too.

452
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:53,405
Hello, Niles.

453
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:55,396
Hey.

454
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:58,269
What's going on?

455
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:01,380
Heat wave in Texas.

456
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:04,116
Well, Niles, maybe you should, uh,

457
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:06,418
put some clothes on.

458
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:07,407
Ah...

459
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:08,912
nah.

460
00:18:10,355 --> 00:18:11,356
No. No, too much. Too much on me.

461
00:18:11,356 --> 00:18:12,858
I'm feeling very constricted.

462
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:14,849
me. I'm fine now . Don't touch

463
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:18,163
Niles,

464
00:18:18,163 --> 00:18:20,132
Iook at yourself.

465
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:22,794
Hello.

466
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:28,904
I think I'm having that dream
where I'm naked in Nervosa.

467
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:32,141
I think a lot of people
are having that dream.

468
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:36,148
We have to go now, Niles.

469
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:37,638
Oh. But...

470
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:39,549
you're not getting in my car like that.

471
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,421
Is he okay?

472
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:44,123
It's just a-a panic attack.

473
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,424
It's happened before,

474
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:48,127
but he's never been quite this close

475
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,424
to butterfly-net territory.

476
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,433
May I have your apron, please?

477
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:56,435
And-and yours?

478
00:18:56,435 --> 00:18:59,438
All right, Niles, I'm
going to wrap you up

479
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:02,141
Iike a big, green Christmas present.

480
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,442
You like Christmas, don't you?

481
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:04,443
There we are.

482
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:05,444
Oh.

483
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:06,433
(chuckling)

484
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,135
ROZ: Okay, listen up.

485
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:11,150
Me and my friends are
going to back out of here,

486
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,451
nice and easy.

487
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:14,146
As far as any of you are concerned,

488
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:15,454
this never happened.

489
00:19:15,454 --> 00:19:18,157
And if any of you decide to be a hero

490
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:22,457
and call the police,
trust me, I will find you.

491
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:25,430
Oh, Roz, that was persuasive.

492
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:27,432
Well, there's nothing
worse than waking up naked

493
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:28,421
with a bunch of cops standing around.

494
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:30,834
I bet.

495
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:33,805
Well, there he is!

496
00:19:33,805 --> 00:19:35,807
Rise and shine, lazybones.

497
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,309
I'm surprised it's still light out.

498
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:39,311
I thought it would be dark by now.

499
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:40,312
Well, it was already.

500
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:41,802
You've been asleep for 20 hours.

501
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:44,816
Oh, well, I guess I needed it.

502
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:45,805
So how are you feeling?

503
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:47,319
Oh, much better.

504
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:50,322
Frasier, I'm so sorry I embarrassed you.

505
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:52,256
Niles, you didn't embarrass me one bit.

506
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:55,260
Well, maybe... maybe just a little.

507
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,562
On our way to the car,

508
00:19:56,562 --> 00:19:58,257
a breeze from a passing school bus

509
00:19:58,564 --> 00:20:02,267
turned your apron into a cape and...

510
00:20:02,267 --> 00:20:03,564
(phone rings)

511
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:08,407
Hello?

512
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:09,704
 It's Maris.

513
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,643
You don't have to take this.

514
00:20:11,643 --> 00:20:13,372
No, I really should.

515
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:18,417
Hello, Maris.

516
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:19,418
Yes, yes, listen,

517
00:20:19,418 --> 00:20:21,486
there's something I-I want to say...

518
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:23,388
Yes, but...

519
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:25,224
Well, of course, you're alone!

520
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,215
You're alone because you
killed your boyfriend!

521
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:33,365
Now, I am on your side,
but there is a limit

522
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:35,367
because I have a
wonderful, pregnant wife.

523
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:37,369
And as far as my attention is concerned,

524
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:39,871
she comes first, always.

525
00:20:39,871 --> 00:20:41,873
I will help you through this,

526
00:20:41,873 --> 00:20:44,364
but now you have to help
me by saying good-bye.

527
00:20:44,876 --> 00:20:46,343
No. No. No. What do you have to say?

528
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:48,370
Yes, good-bye.

529
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:52,817
Now there's the Niles that's
been missing in action.

530
00:20:53,018 --> 00:20:54,519
Thanks for what you said about me.

531
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:56,521
Though I haven't been
completely wonderful.

532
00:20:56,521 --> 00:20:58,955
No, you've been irritable and
you made me sleep on a couch.

533
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:01,994
That's the stuff, Niles.

534
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:03,484
Doesn't it feel good to
get it off your chest?

535
00:21:03,795 --> 00:21:06,525
Oh, stuff it, Mr. Malaprop.

536
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:09,091
Family spokesman.

537
00:21:09,534 --> 00:21:11,934
The Manson family should
have a spokesman like you.

538
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:15,731
He's really getting the
hang of this, isn't he?

539
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:17,672
And you.

540
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:19,678
I'd have been home from
that jail an hour earlier

541
00:21:19,678 --> 00:21:21,509
if you hadn't convince d your buddies

542
00:21:22,014 --> 00:21:23,504
to let you squeeze off a
few rounds into a Dumpster.

543
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:25,517
You kept him waiting

544
00:21:25,517 --> 00:21:27,519
while I was at home worried sick?

545
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:29,021
I was doing him a favor.

546
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:30,856
Keeping him away from
you and your hormones.

547
00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:31,857
Oh, some favor.

548
00:21:31,857 --> 00:21:32,858
Making me stay with Frasier.

549
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:34,359
He made me do housework.

550
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:35,849
I'd forgotten that until this moment.

551
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:38,360
You made her do housework?!

552
00:21:38,664 --> 00:21:39,898
A pregnant woman? That's pretty low.

553
00:21:39,898 --> 00:21:43,035
Oh, fine! Fine!

554
00:21:43,035 --> 00:21:46,004
Turn your anger on me!

555
00:21:46,004 --> 00:21:48,006
It's almost as if you'd forgotten

556
00:21:48,006 --> 00:21:49,997
that not three days ago,

557
00:21:52,411 --> 00:21:55,903
I was punched in the
face by a man now dead.

558
00:22:00,619 --> 00:22:02,654
Thank you.

559
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:04,019
Now who wants pancakes?
