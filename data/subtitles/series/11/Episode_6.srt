1
00:00:09,075 --> 00:00:12,012
Mm, that Lemon Sunrise
smells refreshing.

2
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,314
Ugh! It tastes like a cup of cold sick.

3
00:00:14,314 --> 00:00:16,016
It's hell to be pregnant.

4
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:16,683
I know.

5
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:17,547
No, you don't.

6
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:19,052
No, I don' t.

7
00:00:19,052 --> 00:00:23,556
And that's why I got you this present.

8
00:00:23,556 --> 00:00:25,046
"Belle Du Jour Day Spa"?

9
00:00:25,558 --> 00:00:27,560
Yes, it's for this afternoon.

10
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,551
I think you need a little pampering.

11
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:30,560
Oh, Niles!

12
00:00:31,064 --> 00:00:32,565
I'm so lucky to have a husband

13
00:00:32,565 --> 00:00:34,556
who's so tolerant of my...

14
00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:35,432
Mood swings?

15
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:37,404
I would have come up with it.

16
00:00:37,404 --> 00:00:38,405
I'm not stupid.

17
00:00:38,405 --> 00:00:40,407
Hello, all. Hello. Hey.

18
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:42,409
What a glorious morning it is, isn't it?

19
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:44,104
May I get my usual, please?

20
00:00:44,411 --> 00:00:46,112
Well, well, nice to see

21
00:00:46,112 --> 00:00:48,114
you're approaching your
first day of private practice

22
00:00:48,114 --> 00:00:49,416
with such an upbeat attitude.

23
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:51,117
Yes, I'm like an eager schoolboy

24
00:00:51,117 --> 00:00:52,419
on his first day of fractions.

25
00:00:52,419 --> 00:00:55,121
So, how was the Vanlandingham's
party last night?

26
00:00:55,121 --> 00:00:57,123
Weren't you lucky to
snare an invitation?

27
00:00:57,123 --> 00:00:58,124
Yes. No.

28
00:00:58,124 --> 00:00:59,426
No.

29
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:01,758
Well, I'd better get
over to your father' s.

30
00:01:02,262 --> 00:01:03,263
Call me later.

31
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:04,252
I will.

32
00:01:04,764 --> 00:01:07,767
Thanks again for my day of beauty.

33
00:01:07,767 --> 00:01:10,270
I'm sorry I snapped at you.

34
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:12,135
Did you snap at me ?
I didn't even notice .

35
00:01:12,605 --> 00:01:14,095
That's because you don't listen.

36
00:01:19,112 --> 00:01:20,113
Ah...

37
00:01:20,113 --> 00:01:21,614
the mood swings.

38
00:01:21,614 --> 00:01:22,615
Takes me back.

39
00:01:22,615 --> 00:01:23,616
Thank you.

40
00:01:23,616 --> 00:01:25,618
Well, anyway, in honor
of your first day,

41
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:27,120
I want to take you out to lunch.

42
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,621
There's a wonderful Indian restaurant

43
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:30,123
right across the street
from our building.

44
00:01:30,123 --> 00:01:31,624
Could we order in from them?

45
00:01:31,624 --> 00:01:34,127
I'm booked except between the
hours of 1 1 :45 and 1 2:30.

46
00:01:34,127 --> 00:01:35,116
All right.

47
00:01:35,628 --> 00:01:38,298
My, that's an ambitious first day.

48
00:01:38,298 --> 00:01:39,599
Yes, well, I want to pack in all I can.

49
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:42,302
That's why I took the day
off from my radio snow.

50
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:44,293
Well, happy sailing
through the choppy waters

51
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:46,306
of the dysfunctional and the disturbed.

52
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:48,604
"Optional eyebrow wax"?!

53
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:50,606
What is that supposed to mean?!

54
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:51,606
(sobbing)

55
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:56,604
Same to you, skipper.

56
00:02:01,888 --> 00:02:03,389
Dr. Crane? I'm Peggy.

57
00:02:03,389 --> 00:02:04,891
I hope I'm not late.

58
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:05,880
Not at all. Won't you come in?

59
00:02:06,392 --> 00:02:07,393
I'm Dr. Frasier Crane.

60
00:02:07,393 --> 00:02:08,382
Please, be seated.

61
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:11,295
First of all, welcome.

62
00:02:11,664 --> 00:02:14,334
Whether our journey
together lasts for years

63
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:16,536
or just one day,

64
00:02:16,536 --> 00:02:19,172
I can't tell you howexcitedl am

65
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:20,469
to take this first step with you.

66
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,343
You know I'm just the temp?

67
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:24,332
Ah.

68
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:26,746
Well, I see my first patient is here.

69
00:02:26,746 --> 00:02:28,248
If you could just see her in.

70
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:29,249
Thank you.

71
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:30,739
Righty-o.

72
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:33,241
Go right in.

73
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:36,756
Hello, Dr. Crane. I'm Jane Walsh.

74
00:02:36,756 --> 00:02:38,258
Hello, Jane. Please
be seated, won't you?

75
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:39,759
I'm Dr. Frasier Crane.

76
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:41,761
First of all, welcome.

77
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:43,592
Whether our journey

78
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:47,267
together lasts for years
or just for one day,

79
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:48,768
I can't tell you how excited I am

80
00:02:48,768 --> 00:02:50,258
to take this first step with you.

81
00:02:50,703 --> 00:02:52,227
Have we met?

82
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:54,307
Ah, I am in the media.

83
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:56,298
So my face is recognizable.

84
00:02:56,609 --> 00:02:58,304
But don't let that inhibit you.

85
00:02:58,611 --> 00:03:01,314
Please, what's on your mind?

86
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:02,615
Okay, um....

87
00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:08,254
sometimes I feel this, this
kind of sadness hanging over me.

88
00:03:08,254 --> 00:03:09,414
I see.

89
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:13,593
 And is this sadness
triggered by anything.

90
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:16,229
Wait. Did you ever date a
woman named Stephanie Walsh?

91
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:17,630
Yes, a few years ago.

92
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,332
She's my sister.

93
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:20,321
Oh.

94
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:22,268
Yeah, I met you at a party once.

95
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:24,237
Oh, well, then I'm
glad we cleared that up.

96
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:28,875
All right, now, this sadness of yours,

97
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,243
is it a general...

98
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:31,267
(snickering)

99
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:34,581
I'm sorry.

100
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:36,983
I was just remembering something.

101
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:39,219
 Uh, yeah, I'm sad all the time

102
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:41,354
Ah. Yes, well,

103
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:43,356
you are now in a place

104
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:44,657
where you can feel free
to express yourself.

105
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:46,359
(snickers)

106
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:48,261
I'm sorry. I was just...

107
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:51,287
I was thinking about something
my sister told me about you.

108
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:54,334
Well, perhaps we should discuss it.

109
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:55,735
Okay.

110
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:58,738
Um, you were in bed with my sister,

111
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:01,741
and, uh, right in the middle of things,

112
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,732
I guess you called her "Milady. "

113
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,336
(laughs)

114
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:10,516
I see.

115
00:04:10,516 --> 00:04:11,484
I'm sorry. No, no, please.

116
00:04:11,484 --> 00:04:12,986
It's important that you feel free

117
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:14,387
to express yourself to me.

118
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:15,888
Please, go on. All right.

119
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:18,686
It became this running joke
between me and my sister.

120
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:22,295
She called me "Milady, "
and I called her "Milady, "

121
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:24,530
and my mother started doing it,

122
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:28,591
and now my aunt has
a cat named "Milady. "

123
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:32,305
This isn't going to work , is it?

124
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:33,606
No, I don't think so.

125
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:36,309
I am so sorry, again.

126
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:37,298
Oh, please, not at all.

127
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,312
 It's just fine

128
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:41,614
And best of luck conquering
that constant sadneck

129
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:42,603
(laughs)

130
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:48,788
(hushed): If you're done, Dr.
C, your next patient is here.

131
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:50,050
Already?

132
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:51,391
Yeah, that's me.

133
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:53,393
I find it best to be no later

134
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:54,883
than a half hour early.

135
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:58,398
Saves a lot of anxiety.

136
00:04:58,398 --> 00:04:59,399
First of all,

137
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:01,801
welcome.

138
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:04,737
Whether our journey
together lasts for years

139
00:05:04,737 --> 00:05:06,439
or just one day,

140
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:08,441
I can't tell you how excited I am

141
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:10,306
to take this first step with you.

142
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,079
No, this won't work.

143
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:14,808
Thanks. Bye.

144
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:16,649
Oh! Hello.

145
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:18,685
Sir... Sir!

146
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:20,380
That's all right, Peggy.

147
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:24,346
Goodness, done with your 1 0:00 already?

148
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:26,648
That was my 1 1 :00.

149
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:28,883
(phone rings)

150
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:32,465
Hello.

151
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:34,467
Calm down! Calm down!

152
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:34,990
What is it?

153
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:39,939
I was planning on lunching with Frasier.

154
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:43,841
No, no, if it's that
urgent , I'll see you then.

155
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,106
Oh, dear.

156
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:46,913
What's got Daphne all worked up now?

157
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:48,381
It wasn't Daphne.

158
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:49,582
It was Maris.

159
00:05:49,582 --> 00:05:51,573
(hisses): Maris?!

160
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:56,684
I haven't spoken to her for months.

161
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:58,421
She said she needs to see me.

162
00:05:58,725 --> 00:05:59,792
About what?

163
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:02,362
I don't know. She was hysterical.

164
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:03,693
I haven't heard her this panicked

165
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:05,531
since her strength gave out

166
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:06,930
halfway through a revolving door.

167
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:13,628
Uh, I have to cancel lunch.

168
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:15,641
Can't you see her after lunch?

169
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:17,143
I have patients. Before, then.

170
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:19,111
I'm sorry. This just won't work out.

171
00:06:19,612 --> 00:06:22,448
You know, you could at
least give him a chance!

172
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:24,439
It's his first day!

173
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:31,557
Excuse me, I'm crazy,

174
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:33,525
and I need to see the doctor.

175
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:37,029
Hello, Dad.

176
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:39,031
I brought you this for your office.

177
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:40,521
Thank you. Why don't yuo have a seat?

178
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:44,036
What you doing there?

179
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:47,039
I'm just trying to figure out this chair

180
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,541
from Stockholm Design.

181
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:51,577
Instruction booklet alone would account

182
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:54,444
for the high Swedish suicide rate.

183
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:56,482
Hey. Hey, Niles.

184
00:06:56,482 --> 00:06:58,017
Niles, listen, how did
things go with Maris?

185
00:06:58,017 --> 00:06:59,485
Maris?!

186
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:03,489
She invited me to lunch at Le Toque.

187
00:07:03,489 --> 00:07:07,927
She's gotten involved with
some Argentine polo player.

188
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,792
Turns out he's a cad

189
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:13,433
and a gold digger with
a violent temper to boot.

190
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,424
That's probably what she put in her ad.

191
00:07:21,507 --> 00:07:22,804
So, Niles, what did you tell her?

192
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:24,744
I told her to leave him.

193
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:27,447
If he causes trouble,
get a restraining order.

194
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,449
She was very upset by the whole thing.

195
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,451
Poor thing completely lost her appetite.

196
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:32,975
Barely touched her snail.

197
00:07:34,987 --> 00:07:35,988
I'm supposed to be seeing Daphne.

198
00:07:35,988 --> 00:07:36,977
She's going to love this.

199
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:39,481
Well, you're not going
to tell her, are you?

200
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:41,627
Well, I think I have to, don't I?

201
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:44,619
You don't tell your pregnant
wife you had lunch with your ex.

202
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:45,865
Yes, I agree with Dad.

203
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:47,834
Normally, I'm a proponent
of telling the truth,

204
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:50,136
but as a man who's deait
with a pregnant spouse,

205
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:52,036
I say lie until your pants are on fire.

206
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:57,543
I see your point, of course,

207
00:07:57,543 --> 00:08:00,012
but this isn't just a
little fib to cover up

208
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:01,514
some after-work shoe shopping.

209
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:02,515
This is a big lie.

210
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:04,005
I'm just not comfortable with it.

211
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:05,506
Dr. Crane, I'm back from lunch.

212
00:08:06,018 --> 00:08:07,019
Your next patient is here.

213
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:08,008
Thank you, Peggy.

214
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:11,524
Well, I'd love to stay
and chat, but duty calls

215
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:14,516
If you want to wait,
he's usually very quick.

216
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:20,020
Thank you, Peggy.

217
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:23,536
Hello, Dr. Crane.

218
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:25,037
I'm Carol Dryden.

219
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:26,539
Hi, Carol. Please, come in.

220
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:28,029
 Uh, won't you sit down?

221
00:08:30,042 --> 00:08:31,532
Welcome.

222
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:35,536
Whether our journey
lasts for several years

223
00:08:36,048 --> 00:08:37,984
or just for a day,

224
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:40,019
I want you to know how excited I am

225
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,543
to take this first step with you.

226
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:44,818
So, what's on your mind?

227
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:48,261
I guess I have trouble asserting myself.

228
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:49,751
Uh-huh. How so?

229
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:51,264
Well, like last week,

230
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:54,256
I was supposed to have
dinner with some friends...

231
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:08,214
Please, why don't you go ahead?

232
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:12,718
Anyway, I didn't really
feel up to dinner,

233
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:16,222
but I'm the kind of
person that hates to dis...

234
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,723
appoint people,

235
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:20,726
and I was the designated
driver as usual...

236
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:22,228
Tell you what.

237
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:23,229
I'm just going to get another chair.

238
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:27,233
And why don't you keep
talking, if you like.

239
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,735
I can still hear you.

240
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:32,738
So we go to dinner, and my two friends

241
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:35,730
on either side of me are talking over me

242
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,743
Iike I'm not even there.

243
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:39,245
And then when dinner arrived,

244
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:43,983
my meal didn't come,
and no one even noticed.

245
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:48,988
I guess after a while, that
kind of thing gets to you.

246
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:53,925
 It's like people aren't
paying attention to me.

247
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:59,791
I can see how that would
be very frustrating for you.

248
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:01,660
And I'm a good person.

249
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:04,270
But sometimes I just
feel like the whole world

250
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,760
is shutting me out.

251
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:14,814
Oh, there you are.

252
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:17,116
I was just calling to see
if you were on your way.

253
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:18,105
I used to move faster

254
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:20,115
before I was carrying
your child around in me.

255
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:25,113
Well, why don't I get you
a soothing cup of herb tea

256
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:26,814
and then I'll tell you

257
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:29,829
about a very interesting
lunch I had today.

258
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:31,820
(phone rings)

259
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:37,103
Hello.

260
00:10:37,103 --> 00:10:39,105
Yes, he just stepped away.

261
00:10:39,105 --> 00:10:40,106
Who's calling?

262
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:41,801
What do you want, Maris?

263
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:45,111
It most certainly is my business.

264
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:46,812
He's my husband now.

265
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:47,813
You leave him alone.

266
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:48,802
That was Maris.

267
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:50,816
She has some nerve calling

268
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:52,818
after all she put us through.

269
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:54,086
How stupid does she think you are

270
00:10:54,086 --> 00:10:55,788
that you'd have anything
more to do with her?

271
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:58,090
Right.

272
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,792
Cheer me up.

273
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:01,783
Tell me about your interesting lunch.

274
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:05,791
Who was it with?

275
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,791
Frasier.

276
00:11:10,102 --> 00:11:12,805
You have lunch with him all the time.

277
00:11:12,805 --> 00:11:13,806
Wait a minute.

278
00:11:13,806 --> 00:11:15,103
I spoke to him earlier.

279
00:11:15,741 --> 00:11:16,730
He told me he was eating in.

280
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:18,933
And that's the interesting part,

281
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:21,436
because just then Dad showed up

282
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:24,950
and that clogged ear
of his was acting up,

283
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:26,952
so I took him to the doctor.

284
00:11:26,952 --> 00:11:29,250
That's not interesting.

285
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:33,092
And your father told me he
was going to the dog track.

286
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:35,083
And that's where it gets interesting

287
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:38,798
because after the doctor...

288
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:41,801
we had lunch at the dog track.

289
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:44,065
Let me just go check on your tea.

290
00:11:47,073 --> 00:11:48,074
Hey, Daph.

291
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:49,075
Hello, Martin.

292
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:50,776
How are your ears?

293
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:51,777
Huh?

294
00:11:51,777 --> 00:11:52,778
How are your ears?!

295
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:53,779
Dad, Dad.

296
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:55,081
Here you go.

297
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:56,782
I was just-- darling--
telling Daphne

298
00:11:56,782 --> 00:11:59,080
that I had lunch with
you at the dog track.

299
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:00,786
Right.

300
00:12:00,786 --> 00:12:02,788
After the ear doctor.

301
00:12:02,788 --> 00:12:04,779
Right.

302
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:09,117
And how about that flat
tire on the freeway?

303
00:12:09,795 --> 00:12:11,092
Niles helped me change it.

304
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:14,100
All right, now I know you're lying.

305
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,091
It all makes sense now.

306
00:12:16,802 --> 00:12:19,004
First you get me out of
the house with that spa,

307
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:20,940
then this ridiculous story.

308
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:21,941
You're throwing me

309
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:23,431
a surprise baby shower
tonight, aren't you.

310
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:25,934
 That's it. Yeah.

311
00:12:26,445 --> 00:12:27,935
But promise you'll look surprised

312
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:29,949
when you come in through the door.

313
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:33,953
Oh, Niles, you are
the sweetest man alive!

314
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:35,955
Well, I should run.

315
00:12:35,955 --> 00:12:37,957
The party's tonight

316
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:41,449
and I have one or two
finishing touches to tend to.

317
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:42,962
Come along, Dad.

318
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:43,963
Huh?

319
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:45,453
Come along.

320
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:47,466
Oh, you know, my ear
is really starting...

321
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:48,956
Get in the car!

322
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:56,842
ROZ: Hey, Niles.

323
00:12:56,842 --> 00:12:58,844
Not a bad party for two hours' notice.

324
00:12:58,844 --> 00:13:01,836
It's a disaster.

325
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:04,350
None of Daphne's friends could make it.

326
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:05,851
I told the caterer I
wanted a maternity motif.

327
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:07,842
He thought I said
"fraternity, " and now we have

328
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:10,345
three kegs of beer
and a six-foot hoagie.

329
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:14,860
Great spread, Niles.

330
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,362
Kenny Daly--
Frasier's boss.

331
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:17,863
Roz invited me.

332
00:13:17,863 --> 00:13:19,365
 Sorry I didn't bring a present.

333
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:20,855
Actually, you did--
a baby blanket.

334
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:22,368
You'll find it in the pile on the table.

335
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:23,869
Oh, great.

336
00:13:23,869 --> 00:13:25,871
Oh, by the way, your wife's a peach.

337
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:26,860
My wife isn't here yet.

338
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:30,934
Oh, no. Whose stomach did I just rub?

339
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:35,214
Wow, Frasier, you're really
stuffing your pie hole.

340
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:36,916
Look, I've had a very tough day.

341
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,217
I'm entitled to a little comfort food

342
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:39,919
before my evening appointment.

343
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:43,222
(Frasier's stomach grumbling)

344
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:45,213
That was pretty.

345
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:47,222
I'll give you a tip, son.

346
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:49,224
Tough nights on the force,
I used to eat like that.

347
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:52,932
Trouble was, I'd be sitting
in the squad car all night,

348
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:56,231
pants digging in, stomach
making unholy noises.

349
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:58,938
There's only one thing that helps:

350
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:01,240
Ioosen your belt and pop the top button.

351
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,241
Thank you, Dad,

352
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:04,903
for schooling me in the ancient ways.

353
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:06,245
(laughing)

354
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:07,913
Oh! Here she comes!

355
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:09,915
Oh! Oh! Come on.

356
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:10,904
(chuckling)

357
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:12,206
Okay, okay.

358
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:16,889
ALL: Surprise!

359
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:18,190
My God, what a surprise!

360
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,893
I've never been so surprised!

361
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:23,195
Oh, thank you, Niles.

362
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:25,891
All these people who mean so much to us.

363
00:14:26,098 --> 00:14:29,101
Mom and Frasier and...

364
00:14:29,101 --> 00:14:30,591
you.

365
00:14:32,104 --> 00:14:34,095
Our doorman.

366
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:39,545
Doesn't he work with Frasier,
that m an at the big sandwich?

367
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:42,548
Well, once word got
out, who was I to say no?

368
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:43,549
Here, Daphne.

369
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,551
I don't see many of my friends yet.

370
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,553
Will Holly be coming? Margaret or Tina?

371
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,054
Well, I had to make
the cutoff somewhere.

372
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:51,557
Excuse me, darling.

373
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:54,093
Would you come here.

374
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:57,119
(loud gasping)

375
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,056
(loud gasping)

376
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:04,570
 Calm down, Niles. I can't.

377
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,573
I'm telling her another lie
every time I open my mouth!

378
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:12,067
Get a grip on yourself,
man! It's called marriage!

379
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,569
Dr. Crane? Yes?

380
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:17,082
I'm Esteban di Rojo.

381
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:19,051
I am the lover of your ex-wife Maris.

382
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:20,040
Uh, you've made a mistake.

383
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:22,421
No, you have.

384
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,957
What did you do that for?

385
00:15:24,957 --> 00:15:27,259
This ex-husband had
lunch with my Maris today.

386
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:30,956
He gave her fool's advice,
and she was afoolto follow it.

387
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:34,255
Are you all right?

388
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:43,976
Niles, did you have
lunch with Maris today?

389
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:46,278
Yes, I-I-I was just
about to tell...

390
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:48,280
So you weren't planning
my shower at all.

391
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,982
This whole party was just a sham.

392
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:52,985
I'm so sorry. Not as sorry as I am.

393
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:54,286
Daphne, Daphne, wait...

394
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:55,988
I don't want to hear it.

395
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:58,290
I've never been so
humiliated in my life.

396
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,281
DOORMAN: Allow me.

397
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:12,171
Dr. Crane, your appointment is here.

398
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:15,174
Is your eye okay?
It's kind of twitching.

399
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:17,005
Well, just a little
unfortunate accident.

400
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:20,005
Uh... please, send her in. All right.

401
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:24,316
Hi. Hello.

402
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:26,318
I'm Shannon Palmer. Hello, Shannon

403
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:28,020
Uh, please, won't you be seated.

404
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,322
Uh, I'm Dr. Frasier Crane.

405
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:33,314
Uh... first of all, welcome.

406
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:38,330
Whether our... journey
together lasts for years

407
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,766
or... only just a day,

408
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:44,303
I can't tell you how excited... I am...

409
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:47,006
to take this first step with you.

410
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,307
Okay. Uh...

411
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:51,310
Geez, this is a little
hard to talk about.

412
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:53,012
Oh, well, just relax.

413
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,313
You know, many of my patients

414
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:57,305
find it easier to open
up if they're lying down.

415
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,007
Um... okay.

416
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:08,027
Well... I guess I
have problems with men.

417
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:08,755
No matter what they say,

418
00:17:09,261 --> 00:17:10,763
all they really seem to want is sex.

419
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:13,254
(Frasier's stomach grumbling)

420
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:21,273
It's hard, because I want to b
loved for who I am, of course,

421
00:17:21,273 --> 00:17:24,174
but if who I am is
an attractive woman...

422
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:25,809
(stomach grumbling)

423
00:17:28,113 --> 00:17:30,149
What was that?

424
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:32,351
It-it must be the, uh...

425
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:35,047
the air-conditioning or something.

426
00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:39,449
Please, uh, continue.

427
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:43,391
It's to the point now...

428
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,065
I meet

429
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,067
a perfectly nice man,
and I don't trust him.

430
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,268
(phone rings)

431
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:50,269
The machine'll get it.

432
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:51,770
(machine beeps)

433
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:54,306
This is Stephanie
Walsh. Remember? Milady?

434
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:55,830
Sorry about my sister.

435
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:59,200
You're not the first guy to
do something weird in bed.

436
00:18:02,714 --> 00:18:04,113
Oh!

437
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:05,350
I'm so sor... Oh!

438
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,852
Oh, good Lord! No!

439
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:09,221
What the hell?!

440
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:11,123
I'm sorry! I-I'm sorry!

441
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:12,624
(gasps)

442
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:14,114
What is wrong with you?!

443
00:18:14,626 --> 00:18:15,615
It's not my fault.

444
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:18,119
It's just a-a trick
I learned from my dad.

445
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:27,500
You certainly know
how to keep 'em moving.

446
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:33,238
Anyway, if you could sign
my timecard, I'll be going.

447
00:18:33,545 --> 00:18:35,247
Although if you...

448
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:37,249
haven't hired anyone permanent yet...

449
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:39,551
(sighs): Well, Peggy,

450
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:41,553
I'm afraid I won'? really
be needing anybody permanent.

451
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:44,423
Uh, I'm starting to think
this return to private practice

452
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:45,891
was a big mistake.

453
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:48,393
Everyone's first day is a little rough.

454
00:18:48,393 --> 00:18:51,396
Well, except mine. I didn't
even have to do any billing.

455
00:18:51,396 --> 00:18:52,385
(laughs)

456
00:18:54,399 --> 00:18:55,901
Nice meeting you.

457
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:58,392
Nice meeting you, too.

458
00:19:08,413 --> 00:19:09,903
(heavy sigh)

459
00:19:14,386 --> 00:19:16,286
Dr. Crane? Yes?

460
00:19:16,788 --> 00:19:20,292
Uh... I was your 3:00 that canceled.

461
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:22,261
I got cold feet.

462
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:24,563
I was hoping maybe you
could squeeze me in.

463
00:19:24,563 --> 00:19:26,565
Oh, well, I was just
about to put this day

464
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:28,260
out of its misery,
but, uh, please come in.

465
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:29,568
Thanks.

466
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:31,570
Hello. I'm Brad Kincaid.

467
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:34,473
That's... not my real name.

468
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:38,410
I'll just get it off
your insurance form.

469
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:40,901
Why don't you have a seat, Brad.

470
00:19:41,413 --> 00:19:43,415
First of all, welcome.

471
00:19:43,415 --> 00:19:45,417
Whether this journey... Well, forget it.

472
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:46,816
Uh...

473
00:19:49,254 --> 00:19:51,256
What's troubling you?

474
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:54,560
Well, I just went
through a messy divorce,

475
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,662
and my kid's in another city.

476
00:19:56,662 --> 00:20:00,265
I came here to begin a new career...

477
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:01,500
but it's not happening for me,

478
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,400
and I'm thinking maybe
I made a big mistake.

479
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:04,869
You know, Brad,

480
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,773
sometimes things take a little longer

481
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:11,265
to turn in our favor
than we think they should.

482
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:13,979
How long?

483
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:16,848
Well, that depends.

484
00:20:16,848 --> 00:20:19,218
Tell me more. I'm listening.

485
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,353
Okay.

486
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:23,844
Well, I've been here
about six months now...

487
00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:34,466
Daphne...

488
00:20:34,466 --> 00:20:36,468
I am so sorry.

489
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:37,958
It's all right.

490
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:41,373
Well, not completely,

491
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:43,375
but I'm not as mad as I was.

492
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:45,877
I just don't understand
why you couldn't tell me ?

493
00:20:45,877 --> 00:20:47,367
you were having lunch with Maris.

494
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:51,850
I was going to, but you were
just so upset when she called.

495
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:54,319
I didn't know how you'd react.

496
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:55,621
I suppose I have been

497
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:57,452
a little bit difficult
lately, haven't I?

498
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:04,727
There's just no good answer to that.

499
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:10,035
I'm too tired to talk
about this right now.

500
00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:12,503
All I want is a nice cup
of tea and a warm bed.

501
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:15,007
Coming up. One last word.

502
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:18,510
I tell you, Maris will
never come between us again.

503
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:21,513
MAN (over radio) : ... under
the baton of Sir Adrian Adler.

504
00:21:21,513 --> 00:21:23,015
And now, news headlines.

505
00:21:23,015 --> 00:21:26,382
Police have just arrested
Seattle socialite Maris Crane

506
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:30,455
for the murder of her lover,
polo star Esteban di Rojo.

507
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:36,291
Di Rojo was killed this evening
at Mrs. Crane's estate...
