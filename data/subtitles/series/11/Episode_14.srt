1
00:00:09,042 --> 00:00:11,411
We still have a few minutes
left, and all our lines
are open.

2
00:00:11,411 --> 00:00:14,312
Uh... shall I attempt
another joke?

3
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:15,071
No!

4
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:17,584
No.

5
00:00:17,584 --> 00:00:20,587
All right, then.

6
00:00:20,587 --> 00:00:22,589
Come on, callers, don't be shy
.

7
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:25,592
There's still time
to talk with the good doctor.

8
00:00:25,592 --> 00:00:28,083
Five open lines.

9
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:33,433
Who's this, then, Roz?

10
00:00:33,433 --> 00:00:36,703
On line one, uh,
whom do we have?

11
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:39,205
I understand
we have... Susan,

12
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:42,776
who recently moved here
from... Texas.

13
00:00:42,776 --> 00:00:45,074
(mouthing)

14
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:48,348
Go ahead, Susan.
I'm listening.

15
00:00:48,348 --> 00:00:50,111
(Texas accent):
Hi, Dr. Crane.

16
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:55,422
I'm new in town, from Texas,

17
00:00:55,422 --> 00:00:58,118
and, uh, I just
left my husband.

18
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:01,284
I see.
And why did you do that?

19
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:03,285
Well, uh...

20
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:05,788
Oh, I know!
He was abusive.

21
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:09,791
That couldn't have been
easy for you.

22
00:01:10,303 --> 00:01:11,702
Well, my girlfriend
helped me.

23
00:01:12,138 --> 00:01:14,240
We just got in her convertible
and drove through the desert

24
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,542
and we stopped
at this honky-tonk,

25
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:17,243
I started dancing with this
cowboy-- long story short,

26
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:18,403
he roughed me up,
my friend killed him--

27
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:21,314
but then...

28
00:01:21,314 --> 00:01:23,316
we met the
cutest cowboy,

29
00:01:23,316 --> 00:01:25,318
but he stole all our money,

30
00:01:25,318 --> 00:01:26,808
so we robbed a gas station
and blew up a tanker truck
...

31
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,322
Yes, I'm afraid
we're out of time.

32
00:01:29,322 --> 00:01:33,259
I will finish with you
off the air, Susan.

33
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:35,128
Meanwhile, this is
Dr. Frasier Crane,

34
00:01:35,128 --> 00:01:38,188
saying good day, Seattle,
and good mental health.

35
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,491
Well, thank you, Thelma.

36
00:01:43,203 --> 00:01:44,504
Or is it Louise?

37
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:46,206
Don't snap at me

38
00:01:46,206 --> 00:01:48,197
because you didn't get
any phone calls today.

39
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:50,210
I told you not to put me
on the spot again.

40
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:52,212
I'm sorry, Roz,
but I was desperate.

41
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:54,214
You know, I really
think you were closer

42
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:56,216
with that character
yesterday--

43
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:57,517
the young teen
who moved into the town

44
00:01:57,517 --> 00:01:59,519
that had banned dancing.

45
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:02,420
Now that, that had
the tang of reality.

46
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:04,681
That was Footloose,
you idiot.

47
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:13,733
Hey! I thought you were working tonight.

48
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:16,736
I got the night off and I am
kidnapping you for the weekend.

49
00:02:16,736 --> 00:02:18,294
Oh! Where we going?

50
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:20,273
My boss gave me
his house in the mountains.

51
00:02:20,273 --> 00:02:22,264
It's very romantic.

52
00:02:22,575 --> 00:02:24,277
And there's this
little family of deer

53
00:02:24,277 --> 00:02:25,578
that comes right up
to the window, so you
might want to bring...

54
00:02:25,578 --> 00:02:27,280
My camera! I will!

55
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,441
Well, I was going to say
gun, but suit yourself.

56
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:30,783
Oh, you are going
to love it.

57
00:02:30,783 --> 00:02:32,273
There's this amazing view of the lake.

58
00:02:32,785 --> 00:02:34,287
You can see every
star in the sky.

59
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:35,185
Wow!

60
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:36,556
Is there a VCR there?

61
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:38,258
'Cause I just
bought a couple of

62
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:40,560
great old Ginger Rogers
and Fred Astaire movies.

63
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,262
Why didn't you just rent them?

64
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:43,563
I did. Last August.

65
00:02:43,563 --> 00:02:45,265
Ah. Okay, let's get moving.

66
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:47,267
I don't want
to get stuck in traffic.

67
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:49,269
Sounds good.
I'll pack some food.

68
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:50,566
That was really nice of your
boss to give you the cabin.

69
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:51,566
What made him do it?

70
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:53,933
I put out.

71
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,238
That's my girl.

72
00:03:01,414 --> 00:03:03,683
I hate people.

73
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,251
What's the matter with you?

74
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:08,254
In a perfect ending
to a perfect day,

75
00:03:08,254 --> 00:03:11,257
the driver next to me swerved
to avoid hitting a squirrel,

76
00:03:11,257 --> 00:03:12,759
running me into a pothole

77
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:16,262
and drenching me
in coffee.

78
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:18,631
I hate squirrels, too.

79
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:20,600
Well, maybe it was for the best.

80
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,329
The coffee might've
made you irritable.

81
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,372
My show today
was a fiasco--

82
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:28,374
the second day in a row
we had virtually no callers.

83
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:31,377
It's getting harder and
harder to blame it on Roz.

84
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:32,674
Well, maybe you fixed everybody.

85
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:33,674
Oh, wait!

86
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,348
There was one caller:

87
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:37,350
my date for Saturday night
called to cancel

88
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:38,651
because I am not her type.

89
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:39,652
Oh, and guess what?

90
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:41,916
Her honesty was not refreshing.

91
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:46,483
Dear God...

92
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:49,362
we're out of sherry.

93
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:52,865
Well... insult...

94
00:03:52,865 --> 00:03:54,264
made injury.

95
00:03:54,534 --> 00:03:57,867
Well, here's something
that'll cheer you up.

96
00:03:58,304 --> 00:04:00,373
Ronee's boss gave her
his cabin for the weekend,

97
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:02,675
so we're heading
up there tonight.

98
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:05,678
Oh. Well...

99
00:04:05,678 --> 00:04:07,380
being home alone
for the weekend

100
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,382
might be just the thing
for someone in my state
of mind.

101
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:10,383
Me...

102
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:13,653
and my shadow of a life.

103
00:04:13,653 --> 00:04:15,421
Hey, hey, hey!

104
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,724
We're not leaving you at home.
You're coming with us.

105
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:19,316
Wouldn't be any fun
without you.

106
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:20,983
Oh, really, Dad?

107
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:23,830
I was so hoping
that you would say that.

108
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:24,897
The last thing I wanted to do

109
00:04:24,897 --> 00:04:26,899
was spend the weekend here
wallowing in self-pity.

110
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:28,890
Leave it to you
to see right through me

111
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:31,632
and toss me a lifeline.

112
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,496
Oh, uh, now,
are you sure, Fras?

113
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:35,475
'Cause, you know, uh,
come to think of it,

114
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:37,410
there are lots of
squirrels up there.

115
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:38,778
(doorbell rings)

116
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:41,269
Well, I don't mind them
in their own milieu.

117
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,783
Oh, guys,
I'm so looking forward

118
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:45,285
to taking in some mountain air
with the two of you.

119
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,287
And isn't this fortuitous?

120
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,983
I've just had
my Tyrolean hat refeathered!

121
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:52,287
Can I talk to you?

122
00:04:52,358 --> 00:04:53,950
(door opens)
FRASIER:
Niles.

123
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:56,918
Oh, Frasier, I have had...

124
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:58,931
the worst day imaginable.

125
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:00,433
I need a sherry.

126
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:01,661
Brace yourself.

127
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:07,496
You always think it's going
to happen to someone else.

128
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:13,513
I've opened some wine, Niles
. Help yourself.

129
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:15,003
Oh, thanks.

130
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:17,483
Two of my patients canceled,

131
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:19,986
and Daphne and I spent
the afternoon arguing

132
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,977
over which diaper pail
we would buy for the nursery.

133
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:23,750
Then, driving home,

134
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,025
I successfully avoided
hitting a squirrel,

135
00:05:26,025 --> 00:05:29,517
only to be nearly run off the
road by some horn-happy maniac.

136
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:35,924
That was me, you simp.
You nearly killed me.

137
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,039
You nearly killed me!

138
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:42,507
And what was that crude
multipart gesture

139
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:44,465
you unleashed on me?

140
00:05:44,977 --> 00:05:47,468
I had hot coffee
all over my hand!

141
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,618
You know what?
I do not wish to delve into it.

142
00:05:52,618 --> 00:05:56,122
I am trying to put my own
miserable day behind me.

143
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:58,613
To that end, Ronee and Dad

144
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:00,615
are going to the mountains
for the weekend

145
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:02,116
and I've decided
to tag along.

146
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:04,497
Ah.

147
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:06,999
So it'll be
just two wheels and you.

148
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:09,035
What are you saying?

149
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:11,936
Well, just that if Ronee
and Dad are going away
for the weekend,

150
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:14,407
it might've been more
considerate not to horn in.

151
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:16,409
I'm not horning in,
they invited me.

152
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:18,511
Ah, well, I would
never dream of accepting

153
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:19,808
such an obvious pity invite.

154
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:24,575
.
You don't have to dream,
because they didn't invite you

155
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,923
It happened so fast,
then he got all excited

156
00:06:30,923 --> 00:06:32,425
and I didn't know
what to say.

157
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:35,428
How about,
"I was talking to the dog"?

158
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:37,919
You know, the poor guy's going
through a bad patch right now.

159
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:39,420
He could use a little company.

160
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:42,799
We don't have to spend
any time with him.

161
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,161
Marty, you know I love Frasier,

162
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:46,094
but this was supposed
to be our weekend.

163
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:47,095
You and me, alone.

164
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:48,972
I know.

165
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,834
But, hey,
why stop at Frasier?

166
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:53,780
Why not invite Niles and Daphne
and make it a party?

167
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,771
We'd love to!

168
00:06:57,483 --> 00:07:00,486
Thank you, Ronee!
Thanks, Dad!

169
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:01,783
(taunting tone):
Frasier...

170
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:09,862
MARTIN: Morning!

171
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:11,631
You're finally up.
How'd you sleep?

172
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:12,632
Perfectly.

173
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:15,134
I was borne off to dreamland

174
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:17,136
by the cooing
of a mourning dove.

175
00:07:17,136 --> 00:07:18,638
Oh, I heard that, too.

176
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:20,128
I think the weasel
s are in heat.

177
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,629
MARTIN:
Ronee and I are taking

178
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:23,643
a walk down to the lake.

179
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:24,644
Anybody interested?

180
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:25,633
Oh, no, thanks, Pa.

181
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:28,778
I'm fixin' to have me
some vittles.

182
00:07:29,148 --> 00:07:31,684
Is he going to talk
hillbilly all weekend?

183
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:33,686
You should've heard him
the weekend of the
Renaissance Faire.

184
00:07:33,686 --> 00:07:35,688
FRASIER:
See you guys later!

185
00:07:35,688 --> 00:07:36,677
Okay, bye.
All right.

186
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:40,126
Aw, Daph...

187
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,617
you know who would've
really enjoyed this trip?

188
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,530
Niles.

189
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:45,519
You're right.

190
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:47,033
But let's not dwell on that.

191
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:48,534
.
We'll make our own fun

192
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:50,036
Right.

193
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:52,038
Something smells good.
Whatcha cookin'?

194
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:53,039
Sausage patties.

195
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,041
Oh! I hope they're
hot and spicy.

196
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,542
That's the way
I like it.

197
00:07:56,542 --> 00:07:57,543
I know you do.

198
00:07:57,543 --> 00:07:59,045
(both laughing)

199
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:00,535
You're so different from your brother.

200
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:01,911
Really? How so?

201
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:04,517
Well, for one thing,
you're alive.

202
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:09,522
(both laughing)

203
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:11,824
You know, I can't believe
there are still people

204
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,826
who blame me
for Niles's death.

205
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:15,828
Oh, people will talk
about anything.

206
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:18,531
So you sliced him to ribbons
with your wheat thresher.

207
00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:20,556
It was your first time farming,
for God sakes.

208
00:08:22,568 --> 00:08:24,570
What did I do
with the salt?

209
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:25,559
Hmm...

210
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:28,140
Huh...

211
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,734
Maybe I left it
in the dining room.

212
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:36,716
Oh, I forgot to mention...

213
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:37,705
What's that, dear?

214
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,713
I just had your baby.

215
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:47,892
I have never seen
anything more beautifuI in my entire life.

216
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:57,797
(gasps)

217
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:08,347
Frasier? I thought
you went to bed.

218
00:09:08,347 --> 00:09:11,817
I had a rather bizarre dream.

219
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:13,686
Really? What about?

220
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:14,584
Uh...

221
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:18,718
Well, I'm not sure you
really want to hear

222
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:20,026
about this one, Niles.

223
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:22,028
Well, clearly it troubled you.

224
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:24,030
It might help you
to discuss it.

225
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,566
You know how I enjoy
interpreting dreams.

226
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:30,670
Well, all right, uh...

227
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:33,833
(clears throat)

228
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,841
It took place in
this very kitchen,

229
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:38,844
and, uh...

230
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:40,346
I was married to Daphne

231
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:42,337
and we were expecting
a baby and, uh...

232
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:47,342
...you were dead
and I killed you.

233
00:09:52,858 --> 00:09:55,261
Well, I can see how
that might disturb you.

234
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,730
Indeed.

235
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:00,096
A man of your intellect
having such an obvious dream.

236
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,335
I beg your pardon.

237
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:04,270
Oh, come on.

238
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,272
You're lonely,
and you envy what I have.

239
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,774
I was just hoping
for something more complex.

240
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,776
You know, a staircase
leading nowhere

241
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:12,744
or Mom giving you
a physical.

242
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:18,718
Well, there were many other
perplexing details

243
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:20,379
that I left out.

244
00:10:20,886 --> 00:10:21,887
For instance,

245
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:25,224
uh, well, there was, uh...

246
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:27,026
a wheat thresher,

247
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:29,762
and some

248
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:30,751
sausage patties.

249
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,735
And Eddie was dead, too.

250
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:37,965
Ah, well, there's
a real head-scratcher.

251
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:44,644
Well, thank you for your
exhaustive analysis, Dr. Crane.

252
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,647
Perhaps you should relocate
your offices to a drive-thru

253
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,649
so your patients could speak
into a clown's nose.

254
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,951
w.
All right, I'm going to bed no

255
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:53,942
I was hoping this book
would make me drowsy,

256
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:57,657
but it looks like your dream
has done the trick instead.

257
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:01,058
You died tragically,
and no one missed you.

258
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:06,832
Oh, hi, Roz.

259
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:08,834
Well, finally.
Your show's about to start.

260
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:10,336
I'm sorry.

261
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:12,338
We just got back
from the mountains
this morning.

262
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,340
You're about to
get all the vacation
you can handle.

263
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,242
kenny says if you don't get a call today,
you're off the air.

264
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:17,677
What?! We're bound
to get a call.

265
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:20,669
Why? We haven't had
a call in six months.

266
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:23,749
Oh, dear.

267
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:25,251
(gasps)
You're on!

268
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:26,752
What?

269
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:27,753
Hello, Seattle.

270
00:11:27,753 --> 00:11:29,778
This is Dr. Frasier Crane.

271
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:31,757
Who's our first caller, Roz?

272
00:11:31,757 --> 00:11:33,918
We have no one
from nowhere.

273
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:35,258
Very amusing, Roz.

274
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:37,261
(phone ringing)

275
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:38,764
What's that sound?

276
00:11:38,764 --> 00:11:40,266
hone.
It's a p

278
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:44,770
Hello.

279
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:46,260
Hello, Seattle.
I'm listening.

280
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:47,773
Not that one.
The black one.

281
00:11:47,773 --> 00:11:49,275
Hello, Seattle.
I'm listening.

282
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:50,276
Right there.

283
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:51,777
Hello, hello, Seattle...

284
00:11:51,777 --> 00:11:52,778
Hurry! They're going to hang up!

285
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:54,113
Hello... hello...

286
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:55,876
If you don't find that phone

287
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:58,117
I'm driving this booth
off a cliff.

288
00:11:58,117 --> 00:12:01,109
(sobbing):
Oh, God, I'm trying
to listen...!

289
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,057
(gasps)

290
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:07,116
Damn it.

291
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:15,768
DAPHNE:
Niles, how's the baby?

292
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:17,429
Have you fed
the baby yet?

293
00:12:19,438 --> 00:12:21,941
Make sure you warm
the bottle first,

294
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:23,375
but not too hot.

295
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:24,307
Should I come up?

296
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,481
(explosion)

297
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:29,482
What was that?

298
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:31,484
Is everything
all right up there?

299
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:32,985
I'm coming to check.

300
00:12:32,985 --> 00:12:34,475
Don't forget to burp him.

301
00:12:34,987 --> 00:12:36,489
If you don't burp him,
he'll cry.

302
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:38,491
I better do it myself.
Here I come.

303
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:40,392
DAPHNE:
Is the baby okay?

304
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:42,795
What's going on?
I'm on my way.

305
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:44,160
(loud buzzing)

306
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:53,339
He's going to need
a new nappy, too.

307
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:56,934
Don't forget your other
responsibilities, Niles.

308
00:12:57,176 --> 00:12:59,838
There's lots of other
responsibilities.

309
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:02,914
You have to prioritize,
and the baby comes first.

310
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:05,342
Is he all right?

311
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:07,213
I'm coming up there.

312
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:11,387
Make sure you support his head
when you hold him.

313
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:14,960
Are you doing it right?
I'm coming to check.

314
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,863
Are you ignoring me?
Why don't I hear anything?

315
00:13:17,863 --> 00:13:20,161
Do I have to do
everything around here?

316
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:29,869
Do I smell
something burning?

317
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:31,040
I'm on my way.

318
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,034
(electricity popping)

319
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:43,189
What was that?

320
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:45,191
I'd better not find a mess.

321
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:47,326
I have enough work
taking care of the baby.

323
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:58,434
(gasping)

324
00:13:58,704 --> 00:14:00,906
I can't do it.

325
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:03,101
It's just as well.
I'm too tired, anyway.

326
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:09,348
Oh, you couldn'?
sleep either?

327
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:12,985
Just thought I'd fix
myself a little snack.

328
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:15,954
Well, you're entitled,
eating for two.

329
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:18,883
I had the baby
five months ago.

330
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,996
Oh, yes, that's right.
I had Roz send you some flowers.

331
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:25,397
I just have a few extra
pregnancy pounds

332
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:26,955
I haven't been able to lose yet.

333
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:31,334
It's really starting to show.

334
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:33,038
Oh, yes.

335
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:34,373
Well done.

336
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:37,069
I'll have Roz
send you some flowers.

337
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:39,340
Excuse us.

338
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:45,244
The plumber has to fix
the leaky faucet in our bedroom.

339
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:47,210
Oh, sure, go right on up.

340
00:14:52,124 --> 00:14:53,626
one,
Isn't he a clever

341
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:55,617
finding a plumber
at this hour?

342
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:57,050
Yes, indeed.

343
00:14:57,463 --> 00:14:59,055
How fat of you to notice.

344
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,235
Hello.

345
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:04,634
Hi. I'm here about
the cable problem.

346
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:06,405
Oh, I don't know anything about that.

347
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,396
I'll handle this,
darling.

348
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:11,076
Cable's out
in the bedroom.

349
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:13,374
Well, let's see what you've
going on in there.

350
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:22,247
Bless him. He's on top
of everything around here.

351
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:26,558
You know, I really miss
playing with Niles.

352
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:29,083
But he's so busy sleeping with other women.

353
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:31,320
What did you say?

354
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:33,095
Have you seen Dad?

355
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:35,424
Do you still think
I'm beautiful?

356
00:15:37,469 --> 00:15:38,470
Dad, there you are.

357
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:40,461
I need to show you something
in the bedroom.

358
00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:43,475
Niles, wait!

359
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:47,479
Please tell me you think
I'm beautiful!

360
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:49,970
Niles, answer me!

361
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,119
Niles!

362
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,087
Are you all right?

363
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:57,790
How could you?!

364
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,124
I'm sorry?

365
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:00,614
You better be!

366
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:13,105
Hello.

367
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:14,106
Oh, hi, Daph.

368
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:16,404
What are you doing here?

369
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:19,100
I had a nightmare.
Couldn't get back to sleep.

370
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:20,446
.
That's strange

371
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:22,114
Niles had a nightmare, too,

372
00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:23,449
and I just dreamt...

373
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:25,451
Niles had a nightmare?

374
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:27,119
Mm-hmm.
What about?

375
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:29,110
He dropped the baby,
and it shattered.

376
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:30,456
(chuckles)

377
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:31,445
That's perfect.

378
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,326
Wait a minute.

379
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:35,995
How did he drop it?

380
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,292
Was it from a height?
In a crowd?

381
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:38,986
Was there water involved?

382
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:40,799
No, he was in the nursery.

383
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:42,801
Yes!

384
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:45,304
Oh, hi, Niles.

385
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:47,169
I understand
you had a bad dream.

386
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:48,302
(chuckles)

387
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:51,076
Yes, it was utterly
inscrutable.

388
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:54,079
There was a table saw
and an apple pie...

389
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:57,016
Spare me, Niles.
You broke the baby.

390
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,184
Now who has
the obvious dreams?

391
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:01,186
It was still more interesting
than yours.

392
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:03,051
Frasier dreamed he killed me
and married you.

393
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:05,824
At least he wasn't cheating
on me with the service people

394
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:06,813
because I was fat!

395
00:17:09,094 --> 00:17:11,030
Will you please stop blaming me

396
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,327
for something I did
in your dreams.

397
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:14,323
So you admit it.

398
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:20,227
Daphne, Daphne, I will always
find you attractive.

399
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:22,207
Your dreams shouldn't
worry you at all.

400
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:24,543
Unlike mine. I could very well
turn out to be a bad father.

401
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:27,179
At least you two
can face your fears together.

402
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:31,377
Whom do I have to hug away
my night terrors, hmm?

403
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:34,219
Oh, boo-hoo.
Send yourself some flowers.

404
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,721
I beg your pardon.

405
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,556
That's a rather
flippant comeback

406
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:39,158
when I express myself...

407
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:41,126
Don't you take that tone
with my wife.

408
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:42,594
He finally notices
I'm in the room.

409
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:45,264
(all arguing)

410
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:48,600
MARTIN:
What the hell is going on here?

411
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,136
Well, Dad, it's this
infernal mountain air.

412
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:52,404
It's giving us all nightmares.

413
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:53,439
All of you?

414
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:54,873
Well...

415
00:17:54,873 --> 00:17:56,773
Daphne dreamed
that she was terminally fat,

416
00:17:57,109 --> 00:18:00,245
Niles that he was going
to be a bad parent...

417
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:02,748
At least mine arose
from a real problem:

418
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,739
the fact that I'm alone
and I will always be alone.

419
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,251
Geez, we come up here
to relax,

420
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:08,220
and you're arguing
about your dreams?

421
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,745
Dreams that reveal
genuine anxieties which were...

422
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:12,291
Blah, blah, blah.

424
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:15,782
You're afraid you're going to end up alone?

425
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:17,296
You'll still have your family.

426
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:19,465
You're afraid you're
going to be a bad father?

427
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:21,160
Join the club.

428
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:23,332
Now just clam up
and go to bed.

429
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:30,199
You know, I'm starting to regrinviting
him up here.

430
00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:40,319
Dad, we're sorry.

431
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:41,653
NILES:
You were right.

432
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:43,655
Maybe we let our problems
get to us a bit too much.

433
00:18:43,655 --> 00:18:45,324
MARTIN:
Well, hell, yes.

434
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:47,884
.
If they're the worst
of your problems, you're lucky

435
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,928
I got a bullet in my hip,

436
00:18:49,928 --> 00:18:51,430
a girlfriend
who's too good for me

437
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:52,831
and might realize it any day,

438
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:55,300
a dog who's pushing
80 in human years

439
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,802
and I'm not far behind him--

440
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:59,338
but you don't hear me
making a fuss, do you?

441
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:00,472
know why?

442
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:03,308
'Cause I focus on
what's good about my life.

443
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:05,477
You know what
you people should do?

444
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:07,172
Let's tell them, Ronee.

445
00:19:08,947 --> 00:19:11,383
(playing lively piano intro)

446
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:15,454
Grab your coat
and get your hat??

447
00:19:15,454 --> 00:19:18,446
Leave your worries
on the doorstep??

448
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:21,949
Life can be so sweet??

449
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:25,464
On the sunny side
of the street...??

450
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:29,958
(lush orchestration begins)

451
00:19:44,316 --> 00:19:48,754
Can't you hear
the pitter-pat??

452
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:52,424
And that happy tune
is your step??

453
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:55,928
Life can be complete??

454
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:58,920
On the sunny side
of the street??

455
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:02,400
MARTIN AND RONEE:
I used to walk in the shade?

456
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:06,301
With my blues on parade?

457
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:10,201
But I'm not afraid??

458
00:20:10,442 --> 00:20:14,674
This rover crossed over?

459
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,050
If I never have a cent

460
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:21,918
I'll be rich as Rockefeller

461
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:25,524
Gold dust at my feet??
