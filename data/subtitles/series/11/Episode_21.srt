1
00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:11,311
May I get my usual, please?

2
00:00:11,311 --> 00:00:13,013
Well, you're
in a good mood.

3
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:14,014
What's up?

4
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,015
Well, actually...

5
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:17,317
No, I better not.
Don't want to jinx it.

6
00:00:17,317 --> 00:00:18,306
No problem.

7
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:21,021
Besides, the mark of a true
gentleman is discretion.

8
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,322
Okay.

9
00:00:22,322 --> 00:00:24,324
Listen, about your dad's
bachelor party...

10
00:00:24,324 --> 00:00:27,027
Charlotte and I spent
the night together.

11
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:29,729
I thought she was seeing
that super-hotty Frank.

12
00:00:29,729 --> 00:00:31,219
Dumped him,
thank you.

13
00:00:32,732 --> 00:00:33,666
For you?

14
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:35,668
I mean, wow!
Way to go!

15
00:00:35,668 --> 00:00:36,669
Yes, I know.

16
00:00:36,669 --> 00:00:38,171
It's funny I should end up

17
00:00:38,171 --> 00:00:39,160
with my own matchmaker,
isn't it?

18
00:00:39,606 --> 00:00:42,541
Yeah. I mean, that Frank
was the whole package.

19
00:00:43,143 --> 00:00:44,444
Those eyes,

20
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:46,613
that chin,
that bod that wouldn't quit.

21
00:00:46,613 --> 00:00:49,082
Yes, well, it didn't have
to quit; it was fired.

22
00:00:49,082 --> 00:00:50,071
Uh, thank you
very much.

23
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:51,584
Now, you were
saying something

24
00:00:51,584 --> 00:00:53,086
about my dad's
bachelor party?

25
00:00:53,086 --> 00:00:54,587
Yeah. Weren't you
having a problem

26
00:00:54,587 --> 00:00:55,576
deciding on
the entertainment?

27
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:57,090
Oh, yes.

28
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,592
Well, there's this girl
in my spin class,

29
00:00:59,592 --> 00:01:02,595
and she does it all--
strips, lap dances, movies.

30
00:01:02,595 --> 00:01:03,596
Really?

31
00:01:03,596 --> 00:01:05,098
Would I be familiar
with her work?

32
00:01:05,098 --> 00:01:07,532
I don't know.
Have you seenGrinding Nemo?

33
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:11,438
Anyway, I invited her over here
so you could check her out.

34
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:12,405
She's going to be here
any second.

35
00:01:13,106 --> 00:01:14,107
Her name is Amber Licious.

36
00:01:14,107 --> 00:01:15,408
Really? Well...

37
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:17,110
I'm afraid I can't d
o it right now.

38
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:18,812
I'm meeting Charlotte
for coffee. Uh...

39
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:19,801
You can tell her yourself.

40
00:01:20,213 --> 00:01:21,781
Hey, Amber.

41
00:01:21,781 --> 00:01:22,782
Hi, Roz.
How are you?

42
00:01:22,782 --> 00:01:23,783
This is Frasier.

43
00:01:23,783 --> 00:01:25,285
Hello.

44
00:01:25,285 --> 00:01:27,554
Hello. Uh, how do you
do, Miss Licious? Uh...

45
00:01:27,554 --> 00:01:29,823
Um, I'm terribly sorry, but,

46
00:01:29,823 --> 00:01:31,313
uh, I've got something scheduled

47
00:01:31,825 --> 00:01:33,326
so I'll have
to postpone our interview.

48
00:01:33,326 --> 00:01:34,816
Perhaps we could meet,
uh, this evening

49
00:01:35,328 --> 00:01:36,329
at my place, around 7:00?

50
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:37,764
I live at the Elliot Bay Towers.

51
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,332
Can we make it 7:30?

52
00:01:39,332 --> 00:01:42,802
I have to go redub some groans
for He Biscuit.

53
00:01:42,802 --> 00:01:44,637
Well, I'll see
you then. Great.

54
00:01:44,637 --> 00:01:47,640
Frasier?
Hmm? Oh, uh...

55
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,142
Oh, hi.
Listen, I...

56
00:01:49,142 --> 00:01:50,643
Gosh, I'm sorry I had to
dash off this morning.

57
00:01:50,643 --> 00:01:51,644
No, it's okay.

58
00:01:51,644 --> 00:01:53,146
I have to dash off
myself right now.

59
00:01:53,146 --> 00:01:54,647
Oh, I thought
we were having coffee.

60
00:01:54,647 --> 00:01:55,648
We were. I forgot,

61
00:01:55,648 --> 00:01:57,650
I have to catch a train
to Portland in 20 minutes.

62
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:59,152
I'm giving a talk

63
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:01,154
to the Northwest Businesswoman'?
Association. I'm sorry.

64
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:02,655
Oh, no, it's all right.

65
00:02:02,655 --> 00:02:03,644
I'm sure you'll be wonderful
.

66
00:02:04,157 --> 00:02:05,158
Yeah. It's a good speech.

67
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:06,659
I gave it last year

68
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:08,149
to the Midwest
Businesswoman's Association.

69
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:10,163
Anyway, I'll be
back Sunday night.

70
00:02:10,163 --> 00:02:11,664
We can have
dinner then.

71
00:02:11,664 --> 00:02:13,666
I-I really
should catch a cab.

72
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:16,328
Maybe I could just
drive you to the station.

73
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:17,170
Oh, you don't
have to do that.

74
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:18,671
No, no. I'd like to.

75
00:02:18,671 --> 00:02:20,173
Besides, I've always
been a sucker

76
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:22,175
for that romantic,
movie-ending good-bye--

77
00:02:22,175 --> 00:02:25,678
a fog-shrouded train platform,
a-a passionate kiss.

78
00:02:25,678 --> 00:02:27,180
With a romantic dip.

79
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,181
Yes, well,

80
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:30,683
maybe I am, but there are
damn few of us left.

81
00:02:30,683 --> 00:02:32,185
Dip, dip, dip...

82
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:33,675
Oh.

83
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:38,554
So, I could make us
a reservation for dinner
on Sunday.

84
00:02:38,925 --> 00:02:42,462
I would suggest Cucina.
Yeah, okay.

85
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:45,331
Charlotte, you seem
a little distracted.

86
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:47,333
Is there something on your mind?

87
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,836
Charlotte?

88
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:50,825
Oh, Frasier.

89
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:52,338
Oh, boy.

90
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:54,329
I-I really don't want
to get into this now.

91
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:57,310
Why don't we talk about it
Sunday night?

92
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,646
Please, I can't
wait till Sunday.

93
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:01,514
My imagination
will torture me.

94
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:02,947
Okay.

95
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:07,353
I'm moving back
to Chicago in three weeks.

96
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:07,819
Three weeks?

97
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:09,253
It's not you.

98
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:12,859
I bought my old business back
from my ex. I...

99
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:15,328
I know I should have
told you sooner,

100
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,761
but it was never
the right time.

101
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,530
Are you okay?

102
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:23,202
(softly) :
I had to blab to Roz.

103
00:03:23,836 --> 00:03:24,837
What?

104
00:03:24,837 --> 00:03:26,339
Nothing.

105
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:27,829
Are you sure?

106
00:03:29,342 --> 00:03:31,708
This all happened
before we got together.

107
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:35,548
Well, let's look
on the bright side.

108
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:37,417
I mean, Chicago
isn't that far away.

109
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:40,386
I don't want
a long-distance relationship,

110
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:41,688
and neither do you.

111
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:44,390
You said so
on your application.

112
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,692
Okay.
But you know,

113
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:48,528
we still have,
uh, three weeks.

114
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:49,963
Don't be hurt, but...

115
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:53,399
if someone called your show
and said,

116
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:54,400
"I'm leaving town
in three weeks.

117
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,902
Should I get involved
with someone?"

118
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,301
What would you say?

119
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:01,474
I'd say it was foolish
to take the plunge

120
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:03,409
and bring up feelings
that must be dashed,

121
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:06,346
and so forth.

122
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:07,480
But what do I know?

123
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,777
.
I'm not infallible

124
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:11,315
Frasier...

125
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:13,917
All right.

126
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:19,626
Son of a bitch!

127
00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:21,327
Ooh, I'm sorry
. My hand slipped.

128
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:22,629
No, no. It's my train.

129
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:23,630
Damn it!

130
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:24,619
Oh, dear.
All right, look,

131
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:26,633
Uh, the next station
isn't too far.

132
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:28,567
I-I bet I can
beat the train.

133
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:31,470
(train whistle blowing)

134
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:37,443
Well, round two
to Amtrak.

135
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:39,912
I could drive us
to the next station.

136
00:04:39,912 --> 00:04:41,347
Okay, but you do know

137
00:04:41,347 --> 00:04:44,373
you're going
to have to drive
a little faster.

138
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:47,587
You do realize
we got passed by a school bus

139
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:49,282
and a prefab home?

140
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:51,990
Point taken.

141
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:54,794
I really do
appreciate this.

142
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:56,489
.
Oh, it's all right

143
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:58,364
o.
Didn't have anything else to d

144
00:04:58,364 --> 00:04:59,353
Oh, dear.

145
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:03,503
I've got t
o make a call.

146
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:05,405
Could you hold
the wheel, please?

147
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:07,473
I just, uh, got this.

148
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:10,476
It's a... it's a...
a hands-free unit.

149
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:11,465
Much, uh, much, much safer.

150
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:15,815
Can we just meet her?

151
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,806
Everyone in Frasier's building
raves about her,

152
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:19,519
and I hear she's unhappy.

153
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:20,508
I just hate the idea

154
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,481
of poaching the
Steingarden's nanny.

155
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:23,656
I seem to recall

156
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:25,351
you poaching another man's
fiance' once.

157
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:28,354
Oh, Daphne, I was in college.
I...

158
00:05:28,561 --> 00:05:30,330
Oh, you mean...

159
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,631
(phone rings)

160
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:32,620
Well, who did you mean?

161
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,634
Sorry. I have
to get this.

162
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:35,623
Hello.

163
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,003
Niles.
Frasier.

164
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,870
Listen, you remember
that idea we proposed

165
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:41,374
about Dad's party?

166
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:43,740
The, uh, the
entertainer? Oh.

167
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,501
The klezmer band?

168
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,748
No, no. The stripper.

169
00:05:48,748 --> 00:05:50,340
Uh, well, I found one.

170
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:52,042
Daphne's fine,
thank you for asking.

171
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:53,883
She's right he
re beside me.

172
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,522
Niles, I'm supposed
to interview her

173
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:57,511
this evening at 7:30
at my place.

174
00:05:57,824 --> 00:05:59,525
I can't make it.

176
00:06:01,427 --> 00:06:03,895
Oh, no, thank you.

177
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:05,665
Niles, if you're worried
about Dad being there.

178
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:06,654
He's got a date
with Ronee tonight.

179
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,602
(laughs)

180
00:06:09,602 --> 00:06:10,694
Don't we want south?

181
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,373
Listen, Niles,
I-I know that you get nervous

182
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:16,376
around fan dancers
and their ilk,

183
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,037
but you have got
to conquer your fear.

184
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:20,106
Thank you. I'll talk to you later.
Good-bye.

185
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:21,581
South.

186
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:22,582
What? I'm sorry?

187
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:23,583
South! South!

188
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:24,584
What? What?

189
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:26,085
South!

190
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:27,553
Oh, dear, uh...

191
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:29,122
You know, perhaps
it would be best

192
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:31,113
if you just said
left or right.

193
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:32,613
It's not like there's
a compass in the car.

194
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:34,560
What's that?

195
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,051
.
Oh, well,
I'll be damned

196
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:38,564
What's that red light?

197
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:39,565
Hmm. Oh, that.

198
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:41,067
Oh, that's nothing
to worry about.

199
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,535
It's been
on for months.

200
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:45,060
I think there'
s something wrong
with the bulb.

201
00:06:51,944 --> 00:06:54,714
Cell phones
don't work here.

202
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:56,048
Please tell me

203
00:06:56,048 --> 00:06:57,550
you know what's wrong
with the car.

204
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,541
Not a clue.

205
00:07:00,052 --> 00:07:01,542
I opened the hood
as a mere formality.

206
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,549
(knocking)

207
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:11,998
Hello?

208
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:13,966
Uh, we're terribly sorry
to bother you,

209
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:16,436
but our car has broken down.

210
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,427
Well, come on in
out of that cold.

211
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:22,575
My husband knows
everything about cars.

212
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:25,476
Harbin, these people's
car broke down.

213
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:27,576
Go take a look at it
for them.

214
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:28,541
Harbin!

215
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:30,840
(mumbling)

216
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:33,553
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

217
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:36,852
We certainly
appreciate that.

218
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:38,546
Have a seat and have
a cup of coffee

219
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:39,859
and warm up.

220
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:41,561
I'm Sue, by the way.

221
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:42,862
Thank you.
You're very kind.

222
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:44,564
Yes, yes, indeed.

223
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:46,566
I'm Charlotte.
And I'm Frasier.

224
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:50,570
Gosh, you seem to be preparing
for some sort of a party.

225
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,231
Well, Harbin's mother
passed away,

226
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:54,937
so people will be coming
over tomorrow.

227
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:56,938
Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry.

228
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:58,911
We should get
out of your hair.

229
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:00,613
Oh, no, please!
The company will do us good.

230
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:02,911
Harbin really perked up
when you came in.

231
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:05,518
Really?

232
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:08,578
Because he seems
to be crying in our car.

233
00:08:10,122 --> 00:08:12,124
Excuse me.

234
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:13,593
Harbin!

235
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:16,562
For goodness sake,
pop the hood!

236
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:20,193
You will have to excuse him.

237
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,659
He was very attached
to his mother.

238
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:25,771
A little too attached
for my taste.

239
00:08:25,771 --> 00:08:28,763
Hi, baby.

240
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:30,542
Who are these?

241
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:33,713
Their car broke down.

242
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:34,202
This is my son
Jonathan.

243
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:36,215
Isn't he handsome?

244
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:39,719
Jonathan, this is
Frasier and Charlotte.

245
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:40,720
How do you do?

246
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,709
Yes, nice
to meet you.

247
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:46,158
How is your project
today, baby?

248
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:48,160
Fine, Mother.

249
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,060
You want a butterscotch?

250
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:53,323
.
No, I'm
good. I'm good

251
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,736
So what are
you making?

252
00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:59,705
Art.

253
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:01,941
He won't let any of us see it
till it's finished.

254
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:05,638
Oh. So, how's our car?

255
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:07,640
Can we just scoot
right away from here?

256
00:09:07,813 --> 00:09:08,848
No, I'll have to...

257
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:11,551
drive to town tomorrow
for the parts.

258
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:12,540
What happened?

259
00:09:12,818 --> 00:09:15,855
Well, we were just driving
along the highway

260
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:17,755
and suddenly the engine
just died.

261
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:20,016
(sobbing) :
Excuse me.

262
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:26,559
Excuseme.

263
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:30,570
Will you please
cut out the hangdog bit,

264
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,871
Mr. Welcome Wagon?

265
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:33,873
We got company!

266
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:35,308
Get in there,
show 'em some manners.

267
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:37,299
Offer them a place
to stay for the night.

268
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:40,278
You're not gonna
like it here.

269
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:45,184
Of course, of course,

270
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:46,173
you'll have
to spend the night.

271
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:47,753
We couldn't.

272
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:49,689
No, we really,
really couldn't.

273
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:51,691
There must be a hotel
in town.

274
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:54,694
What does this look like,
Lancaster?

275
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:55,683
(laughing)

276
00:09:57,964 --> 00:09:58,658
It's no problem.

277
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:00,798
You could bunk
with Jonathan,

278
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,269
and Charlotte,
you could have
the fold-out.

279
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,637
I'll help make up your bed.

280
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:06,036
No, it's okay.

281
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:07,740
We'll stay together.

282
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,041
Yes, that's right,
together.

283
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:09,905
Well, are you married?

284
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:13,779
Because we don't want
to set a bad example.

285
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,707
Oh, yes, yes.
Yes, married. We're married.

286
00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:16,677
For how long?

287
00:10:16,849 --> 00:10:19,374
Two months
.
Oh, two years.

288
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:23,778
Hey, Ronee, it's me.

289
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,815
Uh, I got to interview
a new physical therapist

290
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:29,651
to fill in for Daph, so pick
me up 1 5 minutes later, okay?

291
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:32,365
Well, just have a drink.

292
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:34,799
Well, have another one!

293
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:38,704
Really?

294
00:10:38,704 --> 00:10:40,672
Maybe I'll pickyouup.

295
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,210
Frasier?

296
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:46,712
You're too busy
to answer the phone.

297
00:10:46,712 --> 00:10:49,015
But I'm just about
to interview this stripper,

298
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:50,778
and I have no idea what to ask.

299
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:54,820
I just hope Dad doesn't walk i
and spoil the surprise.

300
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,123
I'm already developing some sort

301
00:10:57,123 --> 00:11:01,719
of aversion-based mouth dryness
as we speak.

302
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:03,723
This is Niles, by the way.

303
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:08,167
Hey, Niles.

304
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,225
Oh!

305
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,228
What's up?

306
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:15,841
Frasier is going to split
a case of oloroso with me,

307
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:17,843
because we both like oloroso.

308
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:19,779
.
But he's not here,
so I'll stop bothering you

309
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:21,076
Nice chatting.

310
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,717
Oh! Oh!

311
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:26,719
Are you-you here
for the interview?

312
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:28,721
Yes.
Crane, right?

313
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:29,881
Uh, yes, yes.

314
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:32,191
But, um...
uh... the place is a mess.

315
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:34,751
Do you mind if we...
if we talk in the lobby?

316
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:36,361
I guess that's okay.

317
00:11:36,762 --> 00:11:37,160
(whispers):
Wonderful.

318
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:48,174
Uh, so...

319
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:49,875
(clears throat)

320
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,178
How-how long have you
been doing what you do?

321
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:53,879
Oh, years now.

322
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,182
At first I just did it
for friends, but then I thought,

323
00:11:56,182 --> 00:11:58,173
"Why am I giving this away
when I can make money at it?"

324
00:12:00,186 --> 00:12:02,188
Here are my references.

325
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:05,191
Oh! I didn't know you
people had references.

326
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:07,226
Let alone...

327
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,728
The mayor?!

328
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:09,854
Yeah.

329
00:12:10,362 --> 00:12:11,852
I started with him,

330
00:12:12,364 --> 00:12:14,855
and now I do
most of the city council.

331
00:12:15,367 --> 00:12:17,369
Uh, well, uh, that's-that'
s good enough for me.

332
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:19,271
You're hired.

333
00:12:19,271 --> 00:12:21,136
Shouldn't your dad meet
me before you decide?

334
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:23,743
Oh, no, no.
We don't want him to see you

335
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,404
till you're taking off
your clothes.

336
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:27,213
What are you talking about?

337
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:29,181
And why are you sweating
so much?

338
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:30,876
.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry

339
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:34,142
I'm just, I'm just a little ill at ease
around, you know...

340
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:36,151
What?

341
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:40,960
Sex workers!

342
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,757
Ew!

343
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:44,825
Get away from me, you freak!

344
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:48,856
Hi.

345
00:12:50,369 --> 00:12:52,271
Hi.

346
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:55,468
What are you doing here,
and why are you so sweaty?

347
00:12:55,841 --> 00:12:59,937
I was talking to Dad
about my case of oloroso.

348
00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:01,947
Oh, well, if it doesn't clear
by tomorrow,

349
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:02,971
you should call a doctor.

350
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:04,283
I will.

351
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:05,985
Oh!

352
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:07,286
Hello, Kathy!

353
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:08,988
Yeah, it's Daphne Crane.

354
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:10,990
Listen I'm going to be
over here in 1 901,

355
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,958
and I was wondering
if we could finally meet.

356
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:13,821
Oh, that's wonderful!

357
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:15,828
Don't even call it an interview.

358
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:18,097
Everyone says you're
the best nanny in Seattle.

359
00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:19,894
Good. I'll see you
up there, then.

360
00:13:23,869 --> 00:13:25,871
Oh, wow, that was fast.

361
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:27,173
Come on in.

362
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:28,868
All right.
What happened
to Dr. Crane?

363
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:30,870
Oh, he's not feeling well.

364
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:32,166
Thanks for coming.

365
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:33,173
I know you're busy.

366
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:34,880
Please, have a seat.

367
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,182
Oh, thanks.
Yeah, right after this,

368
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:37,183
I have to go pick
up a new teddy.

369
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:39,885
Oh! That's so sweet!

370
00:13:39,885 --> 00:13:42,054
(both giggling)

371
00:13:42,054 --> 00:13:44,420
Well, I'll make this
quick, then.

372
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:46,859
We're not expecting
anything fancy.

373
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:49,350
Just the basic burping,
diapering and so forth.

374
00:13:49,895 --> 00:13:52,264
Okay, I guess
I'm game for that.

375
00:13:52,264 --> 00:13:53,959
Oh, wonderful!

376
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:56,135
Why don't I make us some tea,
and we can talk?

377
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:59,138
Great! Uh, did you want me
to wear something special?

378
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:01,038
Oh! Since you ask,

379
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:03,941
.
I've always been partial to
a simple white nurse's uniform

380
00:14:04,109 --> 00:14:05,667
It's a classic.

381
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:12,307
Oh, hi! I thought I heard
some talking out here.

382
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:13,313
I'm Marty Crane.
Hi.

383
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:15,321
How you doing?
Great.

384
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:16,989
Yeah. So, Daphne give
you the third degree?

385
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:18,547
Oh, not really.
No? Well, that's good.

386
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:21,460
I think she's a little
sensitive, you know,

387
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,962
about being replaced.

388
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:25,021
She's been doing me
for ten years.

389
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:26,927
Oh! But then
she got pregnant.

390
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:28,565
Right, right.

391
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:32,037
But you know, lately she's bee
having me up on the table.

392
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:34,039
I like it better on the floor.

393
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,336
The floor all right with you?

394
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:37,042
It's your dime.

395
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,100
Great, great.

396
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:41,004
Well, uh, maybe you
could show me your stuff.

397
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:42,948
Oh...
I'll never hear
the end of it

398
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:44,882
if I don't take you out for a spin.

399
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:46,542
Oh, sure.
I just need to change.

400
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:47,917
.
Oh, yeah. The powder
room's right there

401
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:48,909
Here? Okay.

402
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:55,458
Where did she go?

403
00:14:55,961 --> 00:14:57,963
You didn't drive
her off, did you?

404
00:14:57,963 --> 00:14:58,952
No, not at all.
I like her.

405
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:00,454
What do you think
about her?

406
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,268
I like her a lot.
Good!

407
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:04,361
'Course we won't really know
till we see her in action.

408
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:07,263
Ta-dah!

409
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:10,903
You're hired!

410
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:19,218
CHARLO TTE:
Hi, sweetie!
Hi.

411
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:21,049
Gone for 20 minutes?
Yes.

412
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:24,390
Well, uh, Harbin was just giving
me a tour of my engine...

413
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:26,051
Uh...

414
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:28,193
You've got either a blown
rod bearing or a loose pin.

415
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:30,559
We had a stethoscope, I'm sure
we could tell the difference.

416
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:31,655
Oh, yes, well,
you know,

417
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:33,632
I'm so hopeless
with cars.

418
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:35,501
I know I would
just misdiagnose it.

419
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:37,503
Wouldn't be the
first misdiagnosis

420
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:38,993
that ever happened.

421
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:43,998
Friend Charlotte...

422
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:47,239
Excuse me?

423
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:49,581
I thought most married
women wore a ring,

424
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:51,572
yet your hand is
bare and white.

425
00:15:54,586 --> 00:15:56,076
Yes, i-it is.

426
00:15:56,588 --> 00:15:58,590
Um...

427
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:00,080
that's because this
is the hand that I...

428
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:04,063
fell in love with...

429
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:06,065
a hand too...
too perfect

430
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:07,366
for, uh...

431
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:09,068
the profanity of gold

432
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:12,071
or-or platinum.

433
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:16,337
After all, what diamond
could possibly rival the...

434
00:16:16,775 --> 00:16:18,470
sparkle in those eyes?

435
00:16:18,777 --> 00:16:22,338
I'll take my coffee
in the living room,
you don't mind!

436
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:28,187
If that will make you
happy, Harbin.

437
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:30,121
Shall we?

438
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,157
This is Grandma.

439
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:48,367
We... had no idea.

440
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:51,110
We are having the wake
here tomorrow.

441
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:54,102
(sobbing):
Mama loved to party.

442
00:16:57,049 --> 00:16:58,539
Excuse me again.

443
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:04,044
SUE:
Yeah, she loved to party,
all right,

444
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:07,559
with me as her personal slave
and handmaiden,

445
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:10,084
doing all the cooking
and the cleaning

446
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:12,364
and the wiping her sorry...

447
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:14,389
Sugar?

448
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:18,370
You know,
we're a bit tired, really.

449
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,065
Maybe we could
just turn in?

450
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,067
Well, help me get the cushions
off the fold-up.

451
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:23,363
We'll make up the bed.

452
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:28,069
You mean, we're-we'r
e sleeping in here?

453
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,075
.
Well, there's Mama's bed

454
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,042
But that's in our room.

455
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:43,250
e.
This'll be fin

456
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,202
(machine humming)

457
00:17:50,202 --> 00:17:51,066
Did you hear that?

458
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:52,168
What?

459
00:17:52,671 --> 00:17:53,439
(buzzing)

460
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:55,140
That!

461
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:56,442
What do you think
he's doing down there?

462
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:58,243
Well, how should I know?
He's your friend.

463
00:17:58,243 --> 00:17:59,745
Shh!

464
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,246
(chuckling)

465
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:03,680
(footsteps)

466
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,260
Grandma?

467
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:25,463
It's Jonathan.

468
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:29,208
I just wanted
to tell you

469
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:33,167
that our little secret
is still safe.

470
00:18:45,657 --> 00:18:49,115
Well, this tops anything
that would have happened
at the Portland Radisson.

471
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:54,466
(chuckles)

472
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:55,330
(footsteps)

473
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:09,213
(voice breaking) :
Hi, Mama!

474
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:16,655
I can't believe I'm not
going to get one more hug.

475
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:19,525
What's that?

476
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:22,294
One more?

477
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:23,283
Oh!

478
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,192
Oh! Oh!

479
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:40,646
I better go, Mama.

480
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:44,309
I'm sorry I scraped your head with my watch.

481
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,864
You know...

482
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:01,733
he said the same thing
to my engine

483
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:03,235
when he opened the hood.

484
00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:05,226
(chuckling)

485
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:11,232
(sighs)

486
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:17,382
Charlotte...

487
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:19,384
I'm afraid we're making
a terrible mistake.

488
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:22,988
Frasier, I'm not
switching sides again.

489
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:24,823
No.

490
00:20:24,823 --> 00:20:27,259
I mean, writing off
these three weeks

491
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:28,560
just 'cause you're moving.

492
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,562
I had a great time
with you today.

493
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:33,432
And with somebody else,
it would have been a disaster.

494
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:35,367
With somebody else,

495
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:37,369
I would have
been in Portland.

496
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:40,339
Come on. You know
what I'm talking about.

497
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:42,274
We have a lot of fun together.

498
00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:45,402
And why deny ourselves
the chance to have even more?

499
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:49,711
I know the sensible thing
would be to just end it now

500
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:51,450
and walk away.

501
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,418
And normally,
that's what I would do.

502
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:54,920
But...

503
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,356
I don't want to be sensible.

504
00:20:57,356 --> 00:21:00,359
But we'd only
have three weeks.

505
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:03,462
I know.

506
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:05,631
It'd be like a summer fling.

507
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:08,361
But wouldn't we be
sad when it ended?

508
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:12,404
Of course we would.

509
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:13,530
That's what happens.

510
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:16,536
You-you're sad
when summer's over.

511
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:19,010
Well, I... never was.

512
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:22,413
I mean, I always looked forward
to the new school year.

513
00:21:22,714 --> 00:21:24,341
I would buy my books
a month...

514
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:27,575
Are you going to
talk all summer?
