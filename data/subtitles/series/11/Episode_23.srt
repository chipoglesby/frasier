1
00:00:09,042 --> 00:00:11,411
(loud rattling)

2
00:00:11,411 --> 00:00:13,106
(gasps)

3
00:00:13,413 --> 00:00:15,115
You all right?

4
00:00:15,115 --> 00:00:17,384
(sighs):
I hate flying.

5
00:00:17,384 --> 00:00:19,452
It's just a little turbulence.
We'll be through it in a minute.

6
00:00:19,452 --> 00:00:21,154
(gasps)

7
00:00:21,154 --> 00:00:22,143
Mother of God!

8
00:00:22,455 --> 00:00:23,456
This is kind of
embarrassing.

9
00:00:23,456 --> 00:00:25,458
I mean, I treat people for this.

10
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:27,221
I'm a psychiatrist.
Well, there's
a small world.

11
00:00:27,427 --> 00:00:30,230
I'm a psychiatrist, too.
Dr. Frasier Crane.

12
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:31,798
Oh. I've heard your show.

13
00:00:31,798 --> 00:00:33,800
Dr. Anne Ranberg.
Lovely to meet you.

14
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,301
Nice to meet you.
(chuckles)

15
00:00:35,301 --> 00:00:36,791
Well, don't let me
interrupt you.

16
00:00:37,303 --> 00:00:39,272
You seemed kind of
deep in thought.

17
00:00:39,272 --> 00:00:41,241
Oh, I suppose I was.

18
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:44,644
It's been a rather eventful
three weeks for me.

19
00:00:44,644 --> 00:00:45,645
If you want to talk about it,

20
00:00:45,645 --> 00:00:47,135
it might get our minds
off the flight.

21
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:51,247
It's really rather personal.
Nothing you'd be interested in
.

22
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:54,421
Okay, then.

23
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:55,822
(rattling)

24
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:59,325
So, I was dating
this woman.
Mm-hmm.

25
00:00:59,325 --> 00:01:01,227
Weren't we on
our way to lunch?

26
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:03,263
Yes.

27
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:05,857
And then you followed me in here
when I came to get my briefcase

28
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:09,769
and uttered the fatal phrase
that no man can resist.

29
00:01:09,769 --> 00:01:13,273
I said I like
your pillow shams.

30
00:01:13,273 --> 00:01:15,275
Nice try,
my little temptress,

31
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:18,278
but I'm down
for at least an hour.

32
00:01:18,278 --> 00:01:21,281
Do you still have time
for lunch before work?

33
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:23,272
Well, my show doesn't start
till 2:00, and it's only...

34
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:25,218
Oh, dear God!

35
00:01:25,218 --> 00:01:26,619
Where the hell is he?
I don't know!

36
00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:28,621
I called his cell,
I've called his house.

37
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:30,123
You're gonna have
to go on for him.

38
00:01:30,123 --> 00:01:31,124
Me?
Yeah, you.
Well, I'm not.

39
00:01:31,124 --> 00:01:32,614
Last time I did it,
it was a total disaster.

40
00:01:33,126 --> 00:01:35,128
Aren't you always saying
you used to be a deejay?

41
00:01:35,128 --> 00:01:37,697
Oh, 20 years ago.
I can't do that anymore.
It'll come back to you.

42
00:01:37,697 --> 00:01:38,798
You got five seconds.

43
00:01:38,798 --> 00:01:40,300
I can't!
I'm a nervous wreck.

44
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:43,303
My palms are sweaty,
my mouth is like cotton.

45
00:01:43,303 --> 00:01:46,306
Hey, Emerald City!
Kenny Daly here.

46
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:47,796
Master of the mike,
baron of the booth,

47
00:01:48,308 --> 00:01:50,310
the man of the hour,
too sweet to be sour.

48
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,312
The doctor's out today!

49
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:53,813
But Kenny's here,

50
00:01:53,813 --> 00:01:55,815
filling the seat,
taking the heat.

51
00:01:55,815 --> 00:01:58,306
I might even throw in
a call or two to Grandma Gert.

52
00:01:58,818 --> 00:02:01,184
(old lady voice) :
But no kids. I hate kids!

53
00:02:01,387 --> 00:02:04,322
Ooh-hoo,
she's in a mood today.

54
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,162
KENNY:
And who's this
coming into the booth?

55
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:11,153
Why, it's Percy Von Snootenheim.

56
00:02:11,397 --> 00:02:13,733
FRASIER:
Turn that off.

57
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:14,825
I'm sorry I have to rush off.

58
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:17,837
I wish we could spend
the whole day together.

59
00:02:17,837 --> 00:02:19,739
I don't leave for
Chicago until midnight.

60
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:21,241
I'll come over
and make you dinner.

61
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:23,243
Oh, that sounds great.
I'd love that.

62
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:25,211
Any requests?
Uh...

63
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:26,913
I liked what I had for lunch.

64
00:02:26,913 --> 00:02:28,214
(laughs)

65
00:02:28,214 --> 00:02:30,183
Why don't I just surprise you.

66
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:32,242
(chuckles):
Still sounding like lunch.

67
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,689
Isn't that
a great song, people?

68
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:39,192
Really brings back
the memories.

69
00:02:39,192 --> 00:02:42,252
Sorry I kind of forgot
the words there in the middle.

70
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:44,394
So, let's toss it to the news.

71
00:02:45,865 --> 00:02:47,367
Where the hell
have you been?

72
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:49,369
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I had a doctor's appointment.

73
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:50,358
It couldn't be helped.

74
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,372
Just in time, Doc.

75
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:54,374
This turned out to be
one of your better shows.

76
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:55,875
Thank you, Kenny.

77
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:57,866
Darling.
Bebe! What are
you doing here?

78
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:02,382
I just came by...
to see my favorite client--

79
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:05,885
and the wonderful man
who's given him such
a happy, happy home.

80
00:03:05,885 --> 00:03:07,387
Aw, you're the
best, Bebe.

81
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:11,391
Good news. I'm busting you out of
this hellhole.

82
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:14,227
What?
Did you ever hear
of Dr. Mark Reisman?

83
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:15,795
The San Francisco
radio psychiatrist?

84
00:03:15,795 --> 00:03:18,264
Yes, we had a nice encounter
once at a conference.

85
00:03:18,264 --> 00:03:20,867
Well, last week
he had a not so nice encounter

86
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,902
with a falling air conditioner.

87
00:03:22,902 --> 00:03:24,871
Anyway,

88
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:27,305
they want you to replace him,
and the money's huge.

89
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:28,608
Poor Mark.

90
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:30,877
What a ghastly way to die.

91
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:33,368
Yes, I cried so hard,
it was all I could do

92
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:38,384
to stuff your demo tape
in the Fed Ex pouch.

93
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:39,749
But they want you.

94
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:42,345
Well, it's very
tempting, Bebe,

95
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:44,657
but I'm very happy
here in Seattle.

96
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:45,658
I don't want to leave.

97
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:48,661
Darling,
it's San Francisco.

98
00:03:48,661 --> 00:03:50,356
Do you know what
life is like there

99
00:03:50,663 --> 00:03:53,366
for a good-looking
straight man?

100
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:56,665
You'll be like a Snickers bar
at a fat camp.

101
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:02,942
Eh, no. My answer
is still no, Bebe.

102
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:04,432
I've got to begin my show.

103
00:04:04,944 --> 00:04:07,947
Well, that's gratitude
for you.

104
00:04:07,947 --> 00:04:09,437
Do you have any idea
the lengths I went to

105
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:11,451
to make this happen?
Wait a minute.

106
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:12,819
You were in San Francisco
last week.

107
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:14,821
Don't tell me...

108
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:17,824
I was nowhere near
that air conditioner.

109
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:19,815
You're worse than the police.

110
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:29,736
We're such a clich?--

111
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:31,604
little woman at the stove,

112
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,606
big, rugged man
with his brawny arm...

113
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:36,598
Ooh! The hollandaise
is breaking.

114
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,978
Dad.

115
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:40,546
I thought you
were going out

116
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:42,048
with Niles
and Daphne.
I'm waiting on Ronee.

117
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:44,050
Listen, Charlotte is leaving
for Chicago in three hours.

118
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,485
This is our farewell dinner.

119
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:47,544
Oh, hi, Martin.
Oh, hi.
How are you?

120
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:49,555
Don't worry. We're leaving.

121
00:04:49,555 --> 00:04:52,058
I'm not gonna spoil
your romantic mood.

122
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:55,361
Hey, Ronee,
what, did you fall in?!

123
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:56,726
(doorbell rings)
Good heavens,
I thought

124
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:58,731
you were meeting them
downstairs.

125
00:04:58,731 --> 00:05:00,722
That's what I thought, too.

126
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:02,435
Hey, Martin.

127
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:03,736
Oh, thank God
you're home, Doc.

128
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:05,805
I'm going a little crazy--
I need some advice.

129
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,373
Kenny, we just put dinner
on the table.

130
00:05:07,373 --> 00:05:09,876
Oh, thanks, but I'm
too worked up to eat.

131
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:12,378
Doing your show today,
I... I got the fever.

132
00:05:12,378 --> 00:05:14,380
I want to get back
behind the mike.

133
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,883
But should I quit my job,
throw away my whole career

134
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:19,886
and financial security
just to chase some
cockamamie dream?

135
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:22,377
Yes! Off you go.

136
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:24,891
You didn't even have
to think about it.

137
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:27,894
You always believed
in me, Doc.

138
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:29,759
(crying):
Kenny Daly.

139
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:32,365
Hi. Nice
to meet you.
This, is, uh, Charlotte.

140
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:33,666
I'm getting
all messy here.

141
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,668
Let me just pop into
the powder room real fast.

142
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:38,371
g!
MARTIN:
Ronee! While we're youn

143
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:40,373
Too late.

144
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:42,041
Well, have a great evening,
you two.

145
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:43,910
Yes, uh, thank you. Bye.

146
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:47,413
Oh, damn it, my contact
slipped. Hang on.

147
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:48,402
KENNY:
Whoa!
Whoa, yourself.

148
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:50,416
Do we know him?

149
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:51,781
Knock, knock.
FRASIER:Oh, for God's sake!

150
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:53,415
No, I know it's
your special night,

151
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:55,416
but my very pregnant wife
insisted we come up.

152
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:57,417
Sorry.
Won't be a minute.

153
00:05:57,724 --> 00:05:59,425
KENNY:
Whoa!
Oh, sorry.

154
00:05:59,425 --> 00:06:00,722
I'll just run down the hall.

155
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,595
Maybe I'll start
over on that dinner.

156
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:03,584
NILES:
I-I'm sorry
for intruding,

157
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:05,598
but nowadays Daphne
can't go ten minutes.

158
00:06:05,598 --> 00:06:07,600
We're late
for everything.

159
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,102
Yes, well, you
know how Chez Henri hates it

160
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:10,737
when people are late,
so I'll tell you what,

161
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:12,500
why don't we call
for that elevator right now.

162
00:06:12,638 --> 00:06:14,440
And tell Henri that
the first round of drinks

163
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,441
is on me.

164
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:17,744
Whiskey, please.
Simon!

165
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:19,746
Oh, Frasier! How are you?

166
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:21,441
Please leave
immediately.
(guffaws)

167
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:23,139
Hey...

168
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,141
Oh!

169
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:27,653
There's my little sister.

170
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:30,156
You're not so little
anymore there, are you?

171
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:31,646
Simon, what are
you doing here?

172
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:33,648
Well, I heard
you was knocked up,

173
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,661
so I-I brought you
a present.

174
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:37,163
Come on in, lads!

175
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:40,064
Oh, sis!
Oh, my God! Michael!

176
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:41,524
Hello, sis!

177
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:43,825
And Stephen!

178
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:45,805
SIMON:
We knew you'd be here
when we went to your house

179
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:47,607
and you wasn't there.
So we took the liberty

180
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:48,908
of leaving our things
in your guest room.

181
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,977
How did you get in?

182
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:52,569
How did we...

183
00:06:56,582 --> 00:07:00,086
Stephen and Michael,
this is my husband Niles.

184
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:02,088
Oh, and his brother Frasier.

185
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:04,090
And this is Martin
and his fiance Ronee.

186
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,025
Hi. How are you?

187
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:07,527
And, sorry,
your name again?

188
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:09,518
Kenny.
Kenny.

189
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:11,531
(thick accent):
So, I'll tell
you what...

190
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:12,532
(speaking
indecipherable cockney)

191
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:15,468
I tell you what, he did
bloody well for himself.

192
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:17,103
SIMON:
That's right, Michael.

193
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,172
Frasier does very well
for himself.

194
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:20,662
Tell you what,
let's take the tour.

195
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:22,664
There will be
no tours!

196
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:25,144
MARTIN:
Listen, uh, why don't you guys
join us for dinner?

197
00:07:25,144 --> 00:07:27,213
I'll lay the table.
Is this real silver?

198
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:28,981
Give me that!

199
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:30,539
(speaking
indecipherable cockney)

200
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:33,519
It's-it's a bloody great
ashtray, isn't it?

201
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:34,577
(shrieks)

202
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:39,025
Put that down!

203
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:40,126
You know, we could have
some real fun

204
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,627
if you got rid
of some of those people.

205
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:43,629
Oh, just give us
a minute, then, love.

206
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:45,995
(Charlotte screams)

207
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:48,668
Who is that creep?!

208
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:51,728
You know, I'm getting
some very mixed signals.

209
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:53,172
All right, that's it!

210
00:07:53,172 --> 00:07:54,674
I want you all
out of here!

211
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:55,675
And I do not mean

212
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:58,678
a leisurely exit--
I mean a break-neck,

213
00:07:58,678 --> 00:08:01,180
trampling-each-other,
this-theater's-on-
fire stampede!

214
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,671
All right, you know,
I can take a hint,
Frasier, right? Look.

215
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:06,085
That's a lovely woman
that you've got for yourself.

216
00:08:06,085 --> 00:08:08,187
Congratulations.
Yeah, yeah.
Yes, thank you.

217
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:09,689
Yeah, give us a call.
I'll be at...

218
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:11,680
Oh, get out of here!

219
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:15,695
Because it's not a word.

220
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:16,684
Yes, it is.
No, it's not.

221
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:18,698
Yes, it is.
Use it in a sentence.

222
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:21,567
Her grandmother's bed

223
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:25,938
was warm and quilty.

224
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:28,608
And why is she
lying there?

225
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:31,668
Because she's feeling
all "befevered" again?

226
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:32,945
Could I borrow your 'F'?

227
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:35,581
I've got a little message for you.

228
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:37,674
(phone rings)

229
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:42,688
Hello?

230
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:44,679
Okay. Thanks.

231
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:46,559
My car's here.

232
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:47,293
Mm.

233
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:48,761
I still don't know why

234
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:51,264
you won't let me drive you
to the airport.

235
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:54,267
No. I can't stand all
that airport good-bye stuff.

236
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:55,935
This is better.
Right.

237
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:58,037
Well, then...
Look, let's not...

238
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:00,028
Right, right.
Because...

239
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,042
if you start...
Yeah, me, too.
Okay, uh...

240
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:05,738
Well, then, uh,
good luck in Chicago.

241
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:11,138
Thanks.

242
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:12,640
Got your ticket?
Uh...

243
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,821
Yeah.
Great, great.

244
00:09:15,821 --> 00:09:18,312
Oh, oh, listen,
I have a little
something here for you.

245
00:09:18,824 --> 00:09:21,315
Damn it, I knew you
were gonna do something
sweet like that.

246
00:09:21,827 --> 00:09:22,828
I didn't get you anything.

247
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:26,232
It's just a hair band
I found in the shower drain.

248
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,801
Thanks.
(chuckles):
Yeah.

249
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:31,292
Let me get your coat.

250
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:36,242
This wasn't supposed
to be so hard.

251
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,743
...
I don't know
about you, but

252
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:40,246
I've had enough easy good-byes.

253
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,248
I'm kind of glad
to have the chance

254
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:45,240
to have another
tough one.

255
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:47,753
Thank you

256
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:50,244
for a great three weeks.

257
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,261
Bye, Charlotte.

258
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:56,751
Bye, Frasier.

259
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,758
(sighs)

260
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,029
(rapid knocking)

261
00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:13,045
Forgot my scarf.

262
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:15,036
Oh, oh, my fault.
(chuckles)

263
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:18,739
All right.

264
00:10:21,053 --> 00:10:22,042
Bye.
Bye.

265
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:30,763
(rapid knocking)

266
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:32,064
Cell phone.

267
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:34,066
Oh! Oh, yes. Here.
Cell phone.

268
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:35,768
Here you go.

269
00:10:35,768 --> 00:10:37,770
Ow!
Oh!

270
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:39,405
Oh...
Oh, oh...

271
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:41,007
I'm sorry.
No, it's...

272
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:42,708
it's my fault.

273
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,010
Lord...

274
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:46,012
Ay.

275
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:48,014
Yeah, uh...
Bye.

276
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:49,709
See you.
See you.

277
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:51,711
(groans)

278
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:56,716
(sighs)

279
00:10:58,824 --> 00:10:59,892
(knocking)

280
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:02,383
Oh, for God's sake, what now?

281
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:11,893
We couldn't say good-bye
on a head butt.

282
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:17,410
Feel better?

283
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,344
Positively quilty.

284
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:35,327
Oh, hey, Niles.

285
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:36,829
Hi, Dad.

286
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:37,329
What are you
doing here?

287
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:39,331
Escaping.

288
00:11:39,331 --> 00:11:40,833
I woke this morning
to find Daphne's brothers

289
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:43,335
playing a game called
"I Can Reach It From Here. "

290
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:47,840
Give you a hint--
the "it" was a toilet.

291
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,331
And there were
no winners.

292
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:54,835
Oh, also I stopped by to see
how Frasier's holding up.

293
00:11:55,347 --> 00:11:57,349
He was asleep when I got home,
and he's still in bed.

294
00:11:57,349 --> 00:11:58,839
He's probably depressed.

295
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:01,353
I'm sure this whole Charlotte
thing has got him bereft...

296
00:12:01,353 --> 00:12:02,342
Shh, shh.

297
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:03,856
Morning, Dad.
Hey, Niles.

298
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:04,845
How's it going
? How you doing?

299
00:12:05,357 --> 00:12:06,346
Let me get you
a cup of coffee.

300
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:07,860
I can get it.

301
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:08,849
I brought you some
of those cookies you like.

302
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:10,362
Milanos.

303
00:12:10,362 --> 00:12:11,351
Oh, well,
thank you.

304
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:13,299
Now you just
sit down.

305
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:15,868
I made you
a little breakfast.

306
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:17,768
I see what's going on.

307
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:19,905
You think I'm in tatters

308
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,896
because Charlotte's
gone back to Chicago.

309
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:23,342
Well, I'm not.

310
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:27,446
I'm not going to say I won't
miss her like crazy.

311
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:30,449
But we knew going in
that our time was limited.

312
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:33,452
We made the most of it.
I have no regrets.

313
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:34,787
Morning.

314
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:37,056
Except for leaving
that door unlocked.

315
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:38,523
DAPHNE:
We thought you might

316
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:40,186
Iike to join us for brunch.

317
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:44,864
Darn. Niles and I just
reserved a squash court.

318
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:48,467
Yes, and we're on thin
ice with the appointments
director as it is.

319
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:49,969
He's already moved
our lockers

320
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:51,871
next to the
flip-flop drop.

321
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:57,935
(speaking
indecipherable cockney)

322
00:12:58,177 --> 00:12:59,345
SIMON:
That's right, Michael.

323
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:02,414
Frasier has a very nice flat,
but you was here last night.

324
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:04,939
Was I?

325
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:09,221
Oh, I think I need
to sit down a minute

326
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:10,210
before we go.

327
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:13,926
Can you believe this baby
might be two weeks late?

328
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:15,361
STEPHEN:
He's a Moon all right.

329
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:18,421
Every lad in our family
was at least two weeks late.

330
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:21,433
Once we get comfy,
nothing budges us,
right, lads?

331
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:22,422
Right.

332
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:25,237
Can I get a glass
of water, please?

333
00:13:25,237 --> 00:13:27,339
Glass of water, yes.

334
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:28,407
Right, right.

335
00:13:28,407 --> 00:13:31,010
...
Oh, Frasier, be a good lad

336
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,511
(indecipherable)

337
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:33,500
Right, lads?

338
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:35,002
Three.

339
00:13:39,885 --> 00:13:42,188
Do you have any idea
what he's saying?

340
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:44,890
Not a word.

341
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:46,926
Apparently Stephen was
dropped as a child.

342
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:48,188
I thought the mumbler was Michael.

343
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:49,452
He was dropped on Michael.

344
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:54,133
The idea that our son
might take after them

345
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:55,835
is making me crazy.

346
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:56,893
Now, Niles,
just remember

347
00:13:57,102 --> 00:13:59,205
those hearty Crane genes
are in there, too.

348
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:02,975
Please. Those Moon genes have
probably beaten our genes up

349
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:04,465
and stolen their lunch money.

350
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:08,104
That is why I am taking action.

351
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:10,115
I was going to wait
to do this till tonight,

352
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:11,605
but I can see that
every minute is critical.

353
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:13,619
What's this?

354
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:15,621
This is called
the Born Musician.

355
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:18,112
You put this speaker
on the mother's stomach,

356
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:21,126
and it bombards the baby
with classical music,

357
00:14:21,126 --> 00:14:23,495
thus instilling
a taste for higher culture.

358
00:14:23,495 --> 00:14:27,329
The closest thing we had to that
was Dad bongoing out "Babalu"

359
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,494
.
on Mom's belly

360
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:31,036
Here we are.

361
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:34,440
Oh, Niles, look what
Stephen just gave me.

362
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,942
You know who'll be jealous?
Mrs. Zicklin from the building.

363
00:14:36,942 --> 00:14:38,410
Doesn't she have
one just like this?

364
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:39,968
No, I don't think she does.

365
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:44,640
I brought you
a present, too.

366
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:47,141
This plays soothing music
for the baby.

367
00:14:47,686 --> 00:14:49,655
You see, you put
this speaker here,

368
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:51,891
just like that.

369
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,893
And then if you want to hear
a selection of say,

370
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,588
I don't know, Vivaldi,
you turn this dial.

371
00:14:55,961 --> 00:14:57,326
.
And then..

372
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:03,024
Goodness, he's never
kicked like that before.

373
00:15:03,335 --> 00:15:05,137
We've got a little footballer in the family.

374
00:15:05,137 --> 00:15:07,206
SIMON:
Finally we got
something we can drink to.

375
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:09,008
MICHAEL:
Let's go to the pub.

376
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:10,376
(all agreeing)

377
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:14,380
♪♪ We hate Nottingham Forest♪♪

378
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,075
♪♪ We hate Liverpool, too♪♪

379
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:17,280
And Leeds!

380
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:20,986
Are you coming, Martin?
I'm still waiting on Ronee.

381
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:22,544
We'll meet you
at the restaurant.

382
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:23,544
Okay.

383
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:26,025
Marty, I just
got off the phone

384
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:27,526
with the Branford Inn.

385
00:15:27,526 --> 00:15:31,530
They called to confirm our
wedding reservation for May 1 5.

386
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:33,532
But we're getting
married July 1 5.

387
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:35,034
Yes, but they have us
down for May.

388
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:37,536
Apparently July 1 5 is booked
along with every other weekend

389
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:38,525
between now and October.

390
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:40,539
What happened?

391
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:42,541
I don't know.
You made the reservation.

392
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:44,076
For July 1 5.

393
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:45,678
I love how
she blames me.

394
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:48,681
Why would I randomly pick a...

395
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:50,683
Oh, no.

396
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:52,048
FRASIER:
What?

397
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:55,320
May 1 5-- Eddie's birthday.

398
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:01,249
Well, I'm sure you
can find someplace else.

399
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,952
We had our hearts set on
the Branford Inn.

400
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:05,958
It's where we had
our second date.

401
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:08,256
We had a little
too much wine,

402
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,970
and the couple
at the next table

403
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,165
said, "Get a room, "
and so we did.

404
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:16,041
Well, I guess I better start
thinking about Plan B.

405
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:17,042
Damn.

406
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:18,711
Well, I just feel
sorry for Ronee.

407
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:21,981
You know, her first wedding
was kind of bare-boned.

408
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:25,050
That's why she had her heart s
on something special.

409
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:27,019
You know--

410
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:31,080
fancy menu, swing band,
flowers everywhere.

411
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:34,582
You need that once in your life.

412
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:39,098
You know, Dad, Niles
and I have been wondering

413
00:16:39,098 --> 00:16:40,566
what to get you
for your wedding.

414
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:43,126
And maybe we could just
give you the wedding.

415
00:16:43,235 --> 00:16:45,294
You still have
the Branford Inn
on the 15th.

416
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,239
But that's eight days away.

417
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:49,475
You'd have to get a caterer,
a justice of the peace.

418
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:51,310
I can officiate.

419
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:52,299
I still have my license
from that time I married

420
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,213
those two commitment-phobes on
my Valentine's show.

421
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:55,414
Are they still together?

422
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:56,472
Not the time, Niles.

423
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,319
Ronee, the boys
think they can

424
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:02,014
throw a fancy wedding
together by May 15th.

425
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:03,219
But that's
in eight days.

426
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:05,657
Well, it only took us four days
to throw together

427
00:17:05,657 --> 00:17:08,148
our seafood-themed "Friends
of the Marina Bouilla-bash. "

428
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:13,165
Well, all right, good.
That's great of you guys.

429
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:14,132
Thank you.

430
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:15,601
Well, what
do you know?

431
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:17,669
Well, leave it
to the duke and duchess

432
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:19,068
to save our behinds.

433
00:17:22,107 --> 00:17:24,268
I'm sorry.
Leave it to whom?

434
00:17:24,476 --> 00:17:25,577
What, they don't
know about that one?

435
00:17:25,577 --> 00:17:26,566
Just keep walking.

436
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:32,673
BOTH:
Well, obviously,
you're the duchess...

437
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:37,356
FRASIER:
Dancers.

438
00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:38,323
(clapping)

439
00:17:38,323 --> 00:17:39,187
Rehearsal is over.

440
00:17:39,691 --> 00:17:41,193
Please wait
upstairs.

441
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:42,194
I don't want
anyone to see you

442
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:43,695
until the floor show.

443
00:17:43,695 --> 00:17:45,185
(knocking)

444
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:49,168
I'm sorry.
We're still setting up.

445
00:17:49,168 --> 00:17:50,430
Clint, would you
please go outside

446
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:52,271
and tell everyone
they can't come in here

447
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:53,260
until after the ceremony.

448
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:55,174
It will spoil
the entire reveal.

449
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:57,276
You can't blame them.
It's 90 degrees out there.

450
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:58,766
It's dripping wet.

451
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:01,769
I hope our Chinese acrobats
are sufficiently rosined.

452
00:18:02,147 --> 00:18:04,216
MARTIN:
Holy mackerel.

453
00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:05,717
You guys
are amazing.

454
00:18:05,717 --> 00:18:08,320
Well, I'm glad you
like it, you two,

455
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,089
but listen, you've
got to go get changed.

456
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,523
You're getting married
in ten minutes.

457
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:12,624
Traffic was bad--
we got stuck

458
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:14,353
behind this old bus,
a church group, I think.

459
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,652
Good. Our gospel
choir is here.

460
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:17,150
Niles, go make
sure they're

461
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:18,664
fitted with
their angel wings

462
00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:20,165
and give them all
a meal voucher.

463
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:21,667
(knocking)

464
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:24,136
ROZ:
Frasier!

465
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:25,204
Roz, I'm sorry.
I can't let you in.

466
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:26,193
I know it's warm out there...

467
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:27,569
Tell you what, go have
a cool drink with Kenny.

468
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:29,541
I just did.

469
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:31,099
He told me all about
his new deejay job.

470
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:32,177
Oh, well, good for him.

471
00:18:32,177 --> 00:18:33,178
I'll come down
and give him a hug.

472
00:18:33,178 --> 00:18:34,680
Well,
bring a towel.

473
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,408
He just sweated
through a hammock.

474
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:37,282
This sucks.

475
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:39,184
The softest boss we
ever had is leaving.

476
00:18:39,184 --> 00:18:41,854
Come on, Frasier.
Let me in. It's hot.

477
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:44,356
All right, Roz.
I can't say I blame you.

478
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:46,291
It's like the ninth
circle of hell out here.

479
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,694
Do you love
this weather or what?

480
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:51,263
Bebe, what are you doing here?

481
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,866
Your strategy
worked, you genius.

482
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:54,730
What strategy?

483
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:56,502
Turning down
the San Francisco job.

484
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:58,436
They offered you
20% more money

485
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:01,773
and thrown in a weekly TV gig
on the morning news.

486
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:02,865
Television?

487
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:05,377
Well, that certainly
sounds tempting, but...

488
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:07,379
but my home is here.

489
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:09,314
There are more important
things than money.

490
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:11,216
Yes, I know. There's power,
but money can buy that.

491
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:12,217
Bebe!

492
00:19:12,217 --> 00:19:13,275
Fine.

493
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:17,216
If you don't like
the terms of the deal,

494
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:18,524
I'll have another
swing at it.

495
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:19,525
Did that old man
just faint?

496
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:20,389
What?!

497
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:21,784
Oh, good Lord.

498
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:24,785
That's my cannon operator.
At the end of the ceremony,

499
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:26,798
he's supposed to fire
that antique cannon.

500
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:27,787
I'm not sure there's
anybody else

501
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,301
who knows how to work
the damn thing.

502
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:30,802
(groans)

503
00:19:30,802 --> 00:19:31,700
Frasier!

504
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:33,238
Niles!

505
00:19:33,238 --> 00:19:33,939
BOTH:
Disaster!

506
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:35,240
Dear God. You first.

507
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,808
Our cannon man
is down-- heatstroke.

508
00:19:36,808 --> 00:19:39,208
Our flower girl
is down-- drunk.

509
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:40,545
The flower girl?

510
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:42,814
Apparently someone
gave her champagne.

511
00:19:42,814 --> 00:19:45,918
Who would give liquor
to a six-year-old girl?

512
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:48,487
Party's here, lads.

513
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:51,490
Simon, did you give our
flower girl champagne?

514
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:53,481
I may have.

515
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,195
Well, the poor little thing was nervous

516
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,496
about getting
her part right.

517
00:19:57,496 --> 00:19:59,298
Nervous.

518
00:19:59,298 --> 00:20:00,666
Here's our little
ring bearer.

519
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,834
Ronee will be down
in two minutes.

520
00:20:02,834 --> 00:20:04,436
Oh, great.

521
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:07,272
Still no flower girl, and
now no one to fire our cannon.

522
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:09,365
Cannon?

523
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:12,344
If it's a cannon
you need fired,

524
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:13,333
Michael's your man.

525
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:14,846
DAPHNE:
Oh, yeah.

526
00:20:14,846 --> 00:20:16,348
He's a great one
for shooting things.

527
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:18,248
Which foot is it that's
missing two toes?

528
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:21,520
Um... that one.

529
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,288
All right, then,

530
00:20:23,288 --> 00:20:24,690
come along,
all of you.

531
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:26,425
See if you can figure
out this thing.

532
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:28,994
Now, your cue to fire it
is when I say,

533
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:31,997
at the end of the ceremony,
"Ladies and gentlemen,

534
00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:33,988
Mr. and Mrs. Martin Crane. "
You got it?

535
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:37,002
(speaking
indecipherable cockney)

536
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:38,993
Boom.

537
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:44,543
Is Eddie growling?

538
00:20:44,543 --> 00:20:46,443
It's his stomach. Poor thing
hasn't eaten since morning.

539
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:48,370
We can't have him
rumbling up the aisle.

540
00:20:48,847 --> 00:20:50,282
Give him some of that pate.

541
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:51,483
Ooh, Roz,
do you think

542
00:20:51,483 --> 00:20:53,652
that we could enlist Alice to be our flower girl?

543
00:20:53,652 --> 00:20:54,720
What do
you say, honey?
Sure.

544
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,421
Oh, that's splendid news.

545
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:57,718
Here, take these rose petals.

546
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:00,425
You're suppose to strew them in the aisle

547
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:01,727
as you lead the
procession in and out.

548
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:03,328
NILES:
You know what?

549
00:21:03,328 --> 00:21:05,397
Guess I better
give our ring bearer

550
00:21:05,397 --> 00:21:06,698
his precious cargo.

551
00:21:06,698 --> 00:21:07,687
FRASIER:
Roz!

552
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,389
Her cue to lead
the procession out

553
00:21:09,701 --> 00:21:10,702
at the end of the ceremony

554
00:21:10,702 --> 00:21:12,704
is when I say,
"Ladies and gentlemen,

555
00:21:12,704 --> 00:21:14,706
Mr. and Mrs. Martin Crane. "

556
00:21:14,706 --> 00:21:17,004
(cannon booms)

557
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:22,347
Not now!

558
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:25,917
(tires squealing, thud)

559
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:27,782
What the hell was that?!

560
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:31,023
What are you
looking for?

561
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:33,292
The ring.
I dropped it when...

562
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,589
It's in the pate.
Eddie, no!

563
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:38,864
FRASIER:
Just our luck.

564
00:21:38,864 --> 00:21:41,433
,
When the gun went off,
it startled a truck driver

565
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:42,422
and he slammed
into a lamppost.

566
00:21:42,934 --> 00:21:44,436
Now the entire
roadway is blocked.

567
00:21:44,436 --> 00:21:46,927
Can anything else
go wrong at this wedding?

568
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:50,842
What?

569
00:21:55,847 --> 00:21:57,849
There's a veterinarian's
five minutes from here.

570
00:21:57,849 --> 00:21:59,339
I'm sure he can make Eddie
cough up that ring.

571
00:21:59,851 --> 00:22:00,852
All right,
then off you go.

572
00:22:00,852 --> 00:22:01,853
Both of you.
Hurry, please.

573
00:22:01,853 --> 00:22:04,356
We've only got
the skywriter till 5:00.

574
00:22:04,356 --> 00:22:07,092
Clint, could you please

575
00:22:07,092 --> 00:22:09,390
turn up that air conditioning,
to the maximum?

576
00:22:09,561 --> 00:22:10,962
That ice sculpture
over there

577
00:22:10,962 --> 00:22:12,520
is by the renowned artist
Arthur Nudzac

578
00:22:13,031 --> 00:22:14,020
and it's melting already.

579
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:17,569
(rattling, hissing)

580
00:22:17,569 --> 00:22:19,071
What's that?

581
00:22:19,071 --> 00:22:20,906
We just blew out
the compressor.

582
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:23,575
Just don't stand there.
Please, call a repairman.

583
00:22:23,575 --> 00:22:25,543
!
.
Frasier... Frasier

584
00:22:27,813 --> 00:22:29,381
You've got to let
these people in.

585
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:31,883
Yes, Roz, I'm sorry.
I know it's warm...

586
00:22:31,883 --> 00:22:32,884
No, it's not the heat.

587
00:22:32,884 --> 00:22:35,387
That truck that just crashed
was full of cattle.

588
00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:37,378
Well, the sound of gentle
mooing in the background

589
00:22:37,889 --> 00:22:38,890
might lend a pastoral effect.

590
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:39,879
Cattle,
Frasier.

591
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:41,893
Large, undiapered cattle

592
00:22:41,893 --> 00:22:44,529
that just heard
a cannon go off.

593
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:46,898
Oh, all right,
I'll handle this.

594
00:22:46,898 --> 00:22:48,767
Uh, wedding guests,

595
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:50,535
we thank you
for your cooperation

596
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:51,536
and your patience...

597
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:52,833
People, please, please.

598
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:58,009
Okay, here
are your pills.

599
00:22:58,009 --> 00:22:59,644
Twice a day.

600
00:22:59,644 --> 00:23:02,714
And you feel better,
Mr. Kitty-Cat.

601
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:04,649
(screeching)

602
00:23:04,649 --> 00:23:06,151
?
.
Who's next

603
00:23:06,151 --> 00:23:07,419
I am.

604
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:09,421
Oh, gosh.

605
00:23:09,421 --> 00:23:10,410
NILES:
Um, actually,

606
00:23:10,622 --> 00:23:11,690
we have an
emergency here.

607
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:12,557
Our dog
swallowed a ring

608
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:13,892
and it's holding up
a whole wedding.

609
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:14,859
Go ahead. I can wait.

610
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,752
Thank you so much.

611
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,595
Thank you.

612
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:23,902
Boy, no easy cases today.

613
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:25,893
Talk about hitting
the ground running.

614
00:23:26,605 --> 00:23:27,606
Is this your first day?

615
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:29,471
Yep. I'm not i
n Kansas anymore.

616
00:23:29,641 --> 00:23:31,438
Where'd you go
to vet school?

617
00:23:31,476 --> 00:23:33,068
Kansas.

618
00:23:33,612 --> 00:23:34,980
All right.
Here we go.

619
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,481
Hold his mouth open.

620
00:23:36,481 --> 00:23:38,984
I'll see if I can get
his paw down his throat.

621
00:23:38,984 --> 00:23:40,519
I'm just kidding.
I'm just kidding.

622
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:41,987
Why don't I just take your pooch

623
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:44,055
.
to the other room here
and I'll be right back

624
00:23:44,055 --> 00:23:46,558
Excuse me. Thank you.
All right, buddy.

625
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:49,789
Thank you. Thank you.

626
00:23:50,028 --> 00:23:52,121
He has no idea
what he's doing.

627
00:23:52,531 --> 00:23:55,100
He's just new at this.
He's nervous.

628
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,102
I've been a bit
nervous meself lately.

629
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:58,603
Ever since me brothers
showed up.

630
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:00,639
Really? Why?

631
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:02,007
Well, you know,
the way they keep

632
00:24:02,007 --> 00:24:03,008
patting my stomach
and saying

633
00:24:03,008 --> 00:24:04,009
"
.
"He's a Moon all right

634
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:06,011
Oh, my God, yes.

635
00:24:06,011 --> 00:24:07,512
And every time
they say that,

636
00:24:07,512 --> 00:24:10,081
all I can think is
what if he's not?

637
00:24:10,081 --> 00:24:12,072
What if he's like
you and Frasier?

638
00:24:14,986 --> 00:24:16,488
Excuse me?

639
00:24:16,488 --> 00:24:19,558
A Moon boy I know
how to handle.

640
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:21,860
But what if he'?
a little genius,

641
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,760
teasing me in Frensix?
by the time he's

642
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:26,198
I've been worried
he's going to turn out

643
00:24:26,198 --> 00:24:27,699
Iike one of your brothers.

644
00:24:27,699 --> 00:24:30,202
I was sure when he kicked
that speaker off your belly

645
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:32,204
that you had
a little Simon in there.

646
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:33,694
They are a handful,
my brothers.

647
00:24:34,206 --> 00:24:35,707
I can just imagine
the hell they're
raising back there.

648
00:24:35,707 --> 00:24:37,676
With an open bar?

649
00:24:37,676 --> 00:24:38,665
Oh, my God!

650
00:24:39,177 --> 00:24:41,042
My water just broke.
The baby's coming.

651
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:42,979
Because I said "open bar"?

652
00:24:43,682 --> 00:24:44,671
Oh!

653
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:45,984
All right, okay,
all right.

654
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:46,973
Don't, don't panic.

655
00:24:47,686 --> 00:24:48,987
There's plenty of time
to get you to a hospital.

656
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:49,855
The hell there is!
He's coming right now.

657
00:24:49,855 --> 00:24:51,156
Here's your ring.

658
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:54,159
Call an ambulance.
My wife's having a baby.

659
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,160
There's no time
for an ambulance.

660
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,161
(gasping)

661
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:57,596
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

662
00:24:57,596 --> 00:24:59,698
You know what?
You call 91 1,

663
00:24:59,698 --> 00:25:00,995
and I'll just
get started here.

664
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:01,995
Wait, wait, wait.

665
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:03,702
I'm going to wash
my hands.

666
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:06,004
(gasping)

667
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:07,839
Are you sure
you know what
you're doing?

668
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:09,602
Oh, I've assisted in many
deliveries, ma'am.

669
00:25:09,908 --> 00:25:11,910
One just took blue rib
bon at the Kansas State Fair.

670
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:12,911
Oh, my God!

671
00:25:12,911 --> 00:25:14,913
Easy now. You'
re doing great, girI.

672
00:25:14,913 --> 00:25:17,282
Don't call me that!
I'm not a bloody poodle.

673
00:25:17,282 --> 00:25:18,579
Yes, hello, hello.

674
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:21,553
We're at... We're at
1206 East Village Road.

675
00:25:21,553 --> 00:25:23,214
My wife's gone into labor.

676
00:25:23,588 --> 00:25:24,990
They say the hospital
is 20 miles away.

677
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:26,691
Can you make it
if I drive you?

678
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:26,992
(yells)

679
00:25:26,992 --> 00:25:29,861
She says no.

680
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:32,197
All right, they're on their wa
They're on their way.

681
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:34,563
Now you just calm down.
Focus on me and breathe.

682
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:39,859
(wheezing)

683
00:25:41,806 --> 00:25:44,876
Oh, for God's sakes!
Oh! Oh!

684
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:46,578
Is everything okay in here?

685
00:25:46,578 --> 00:25:48,313
.
We're fine

686
00:25:48,313 --> 00:25:50,815
Okay. If you need any help,
I'm a registered nurse.

687
00:25:50,815 --> 00:25:51,616
Get the hell back in here!

688
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:52,947
Easy, girl.

689
00:25:53,652 --> 00:25:54,641
Stop that!

690
00:25:56,821 --> 00:25:58,189
Roz, do not open a window

691
00:25:58,189 --> 00:26:00,692
until they tow
that cattle truck!

692
00:26:00,692 --> 00:26:02,182
.
Oh, my God.
It's a million degrees in here

693
00:26:02,694 --> 00:26:04,129
We got to get
a breeze going.

694
00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:05,721
(all gagging)

695
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:09,601
Oh, my God!

696
00:26:09,601 --> 00:26:11,736
Dad, Ronee,
we're almost ready to start.

697
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:12,862
What's that smell?

698
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:14,105
Smell?

699
00:26:14,105 --> 00:26:16,972
Congratulations, you two.
Everything's just perfect.

700
00:26:17,676 --> 00:26:18,577
.
Sorry I can't stay

701
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:20,345
What's happening?

702
00:26:20,345 --> 00:26:21,913
There's been a bit
of a mishap

703
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:23,778
with a cattle truck,
and the AC's out.

704
00:26:23,982 --> 00:26:26,051
But no matter. Right, people?

705
00:26:26,051 --> 00:26:28,253
It'll take more than that to mar our joy

706
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:31,823
in seeing these two become
Mr. and Mrs. Martin Crane.

707
00:26:31,823 --> 00:26:33,723
(cannon booming)

708
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:35,993
(cell phone ringing)

709
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:38,330
Hello.

710
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:39,831
Well, finally, Niles.

711
00:26:39,831 --> 00:26:41,333
Stop babbling.

712
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:42,823
.
Niles, you'll have to speak up

713
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:45,837
I can't hear you with that bab
screaming in the backgrou...

714
00:26:45,837 --> 00:26:47,327
Oh, my God!

715
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:53,701
Isn't he perfect, Dad?

716
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:55,670
He certainly is, Mom.

717
00:26:56,181 --> 00:26:58,683
He's got your eyes
and my chin.

718
00:26:58,683 --> 00:26:59,672
He's got my hair.

719
00:27:00,185 --> 00:27:01,186
Do you think so?

720
00:27:01,186 --> 00:27:02,687
No, he's got my hair.

721
00:27:02,687 --> 00:27:04,177
Let go, dear.

722
00:27:04,756 --> 00:27:07,158
If you can part with him
for just two seconds,

723
00:27:07,158 --> 00:27:08,660
I should finish
cleaning him up.

724
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,295
Of course.

725
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:12,855
We can't thank
you two enough.

726
00:27:13,365 --> 00:27:14,366
Oh, please.

727
00:27:14,366 --> 00:27:17,130
Really. If there's ever anything
that we can do for you.

728
00:27:17,335 --> 00:27:18,393
You can do me
one quick favor.

729
00:27:18,837 --> 00:27:21,397
My Jason is kinda overdue
for his lunch.

730
00:27:21,906 --> 00:27:23,305
Of course.

731
00:27:24,743 --> 00:27:28,246
Hello? Niles?

732
00:27:28,246 --> 00:27:29,247
Boy, some day, huh?

733
00:27:29,247 --> 00:27:31,750
Getting married
and meeting my grandson

734
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:33,184
all in the same
afternoon.

735
00:27:33,184 --> 00:27:35,243
Hey, you guys,
you're just in time.

736
00:27:35,754 --> 00:27:36,743
Come on in.

737
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:43,885
Don't stare.

738
00:27:44,396 --> 00:27:46,864
You were no prize
at that age either.

739
00:27:48,867 --> 00:27:52,237
Oh, look who's her
e. Hello.

740
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:53,238
Here we go.

741
00:27:53,238 --> 00:27:56,808
Oh, my God.
He's beautiful.

742
00:27:56,808 --> 00:28:01,279
That twin's gonna be jealous
his whole life.

743
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:02,871
Your ambulance should
be here any minute,

744
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:04,337
so I think
I'm going to go.

745
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:06,851
All right. Here.
Thank you again.

746
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:07,715
You sure you don't want me
to check your monkey?

747
00:28:07,986 --> 00:28:10,755
Yeah, I'm sure.

748
00:28:10,755 --> 00:28:11,823
Congratulations.

749
00:28:11,823 --> 00:28:12,390
Thank you.
Thank you.

750
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:14,392
Hey there, you.

751
00:28:14,392 --> 00:28:18,385
I'm the one who's
gonna spoil you rotten.

752
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:20,398
You're so sweet to come down,

753
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:22,400
but what about your wedding,
all those people?

754
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,389
Ah, they'll keep.

755
00:28:23,735 --> 00:28:25,202
Yeah, as long as there's
an open bar.

756
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:27,938
Ooh! Settle down there.

757
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:35,280
(siren wailing)

758
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,848
I guess
that's our ride.

759
00:28:36,848 --> 00:28:38,850
I'm so sorry we're going
to miss your wedding.

760
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:41,086
So are we.

761
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:43,855
I feel like it's
me own dad getting married.

762
00:28:43,855 --> 00:28:46,157
It's not going to be the
same without you guys up there.

763
00:28:46,157 --> 00:28:47,852
I don 't want
to forget the rings.

764
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:50,161
Hey, wait a minute.

765
00:28:50,161 --> 00:28:52,163
Why don't we just
get married here?

766
00:28:52,163 --> 00:28:54,757
We've got the rings
and the preacher.

767
00:28:54,866 --> 00:28:56,367
What about
all the guests?

768
00:28:56,367 --> 00:28:58,436
We can do it again
for them later.

769
00:28:58,436 --> 00:29:00,927
And at least this place
only smells like a monkey.

770
00:29:01,372 --> 00:29:04,442
.
Well, I'm game

771
00:29:04,442 --> 00:29:05,910
Get crackin', Fras.

772
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:08,980
You know, I'm gonna
condense this just a bit.

773
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:11,471
I don't need that.
And I don't need that.

774
00:29:11,983 --> 00:29:15,487
Ah. "It was the great thinker
Horace Walpole... "

775
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:18,323
Don't need that.

776
00:29:18,323 --> 00:29:21,359
Well, all right then. Uh...

777
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:22,260
Dearly beloved...

778
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,921
Someone call for an ambulance?

779
00:29:24,195 --> 00:29:26,527
Just a couple of seconds,
please.

780
00:29:26,898 --> 00:29:29,801
Niles, why don't
you give them the rings?

781
00:29:29,801 --> 00:29:31,792
Cut to the chase here.

782
00:29:32,303 --> 00:29:35,306
Do you, Martin Crane,
take Ronee Lawrence

783
00:29:35,306 --> 00:29:37,408
to be your lawfully wedded wife,

784
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:41,279
forsaking all others
until death do you part?

785
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,982
I do.

786
00:29:43,982 --> 00:29:46,551
Do you, Ronee Lawrence,
take Martin Crane...

787
00:29:46,551 --> 00:29:47,518
I do.

788
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:49,988
.
Oh, I'm tearing up

789
00:29:49,988 --> 00:29:51,990
If they'd let me say
what I planned to,

790
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:55,994
you'd be bawling
your eyes out right now.

791
00:29:55,994 --> 00:29:58,062
By the power vested in me,

792
00:29:58,062 --> 00:30:00,031
I now pronounce you
man and wife.

793
00:30:00,031 --> 00:30:03,023
NILES:
Yay!

794
00:30:03,334 --> 00:30:04,301
(applause)

795
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:09,507
We're ready now.

796
00:30:09,507 --> 00:30:12,577
We're so happy
for you both.

797
00:30:12,577 --> 00:30:14,579
Congratulations.

798
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:16,080
And you will always remember
your anniversary

799
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,349
because it's the same day
as your grandson's birthday.

800
00:30:18,349 --> 00:30:21,019
Yeah, and Eddie's.

801
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:21,883
What?

802
00:30:23,621 --> 00:30:25,190
Never mind.

803
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:26,891
Eddie's birthday is today?

804
00:30:26,891 --> 00:30:30,128
So that's how you came up
with May 15th for the hotel?

805
00:30:30,128 --> 00:30:31,196
Uh...

806
00:30:31,196 --> 00:30:32,463
I knew it.

807
00:30:32,463 --> 00:30:35,057
And you've been blaming
the inn all this time.

808
00:30:35,533 --> 00:30:36,522
You are so busted.

809
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:41,062
That was a short honeymoon.

810
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:11,536
Hello, Lilith.
Hey. It's me.

811
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:14,038
Yeah, listen, I was just calling
to check out how Freddy's doing.

812
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:15,540
What? A new one?

813
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:18,543
I thought he was smitten
with the old one.

814
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:20,044
Well, you know,
he gets that from me.

815
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:21,033
Back in my heyday,

816
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:24,549
I had a new chess coach
every month.

817
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:27,609
Well, I'm spending
a lot of time alone lately.

818
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:31,623
Oh, you know, Dad and Ronee
are still on their honeymoon.

819
00:31:31,623 --> 00:31:33,625
Oh, yes, they thank you
for that very thoughtful

820
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:36,492
radon detector you sent.

821
00:31:36,928 --> 00:31:39,097
Not seeing much of Niles
and Daphne either

822
00:31:39,097 --> 00:31:41,156
because they're so busy
with the baby.

823
00:31:41,499 --> 00:31:43,568
Oh, sorry to keep you.

824
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:46,070
Just tell Freddy to call me.

825
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,560
Okay, bye, Lilith.

826
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:02,075
(doorbell rings)

827
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:08,092
Oh.

828
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:10,094
Here to pick up a chair.

829
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:11,095
It's right there.

830
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:12,096
Sorry I'm late.
It's all right.

831
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:13,097
Been waiting long?

832
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:14,587
1 1 years.

833
00:32:21,172 --> 00:32:22,969
Be careful with it.

834
00:32:53,171 --> 00:32:54,160
(sighs)

835
00:33:12,423 --> 00:33:14,425
Bebe, hi. It's Frasier.

836
00:33:14,425 --> 00:33:18,725
Listen, about that
San Francisco job.

837
00:33:19,263 --> 00:33:20,730
I think I'll take it.

838
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:31,305
?
.
Have you heard anything,
Frasier?About what

839
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:34,012
The new station manager
they're announcing today.

840
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:36,014
My stomach is in knots.

841
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:37,415
I just know
they're going to replace

842
00:33:37,415 --> 00:33:41,146
sweet, kind-hearted Kenny
with some ruthless, draconian...

843
00:33:41,386 --> 00:33:42,587
Hard ass.

844
00:33:42,587 --> 00:33:45,147
That would hardly
make up for it.

845
00:33:48,292 --> 00:33:49,794
Frasier.

846
00:33:49,794 --> 00:33:51,295
Bebe. Oh...

847
00:33:51,295 --> 00:33:53,798
I'll let you know if
I hear anything, guys.

848
00:33:53,798 --> 00:33:55,299
It's done.

849
00:33:55,299 --> 00:33:57,301
When destiny calls,
Bebe calls back

850
00:33:57,301 --> 00:33:59,303
and screws destiny
to the wall.

851
00:33:59,303 --> 00:34:01,806
Yes, yes, yes. Shh.
I don't want anyone to find out.

852
00:34:01,806 --> 00:34:03,296
I'm not telling my family
until this evening.

853
00:34:05,309 --> 00:34:07,812
I'm so proud of you.

854
00:34:07,812 --> 00:34:11,315
Bebe, listen, I have
something for you.

855
00:34:11,315 --> 00:34:12,817
I've decided to give away
some of the things

856
00:34:12,817 --> 00:34:15,308
I've accumulated
through the years.

857
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:19,824
Sort of a fresh start,
you know.

858
00:34:19,824 --> 00:34:22,622
.
My baby's all grown up

859
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:26,526
I look in your eyes
and I see something there

860
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:28,528
that I've never seen before.

861
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:30,535
Wisdom?

862
00:34:30,535 --> 00:34:31,467
Crow's feet.

863
00:34:33,471 --> 00:34:36,174
Sorry, darling, but you're
going to be on TV now.

864
00:34:36,174 --> 00:34:38,476
I talked to my face man.
He can see you at 4:00.

865
00:34:38,476 --> 00:34:40,478
Well, thanks, Bebe, but, no.

866
00:34:40,478 --> 00:34:42,480
I'm not talking surgery,
just a little tweaking.

867
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,182
20 minutes.
I've used him for years.

868
00:34:44,182 --> 00:34:45,483
And I'm sure he's very good
at what he does,

869
00:34:45,483 --> 00:34:47,185
but still it's just...

870
00:34:47,185 --> 00:34:49,176
I'm done next door, so
I'll be in the car, Mom.

871
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:58,122
4:00 it is.

872
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:05,136
Yeah.

873
00:35:05,136 --> 00:35:06,437
Thank you.

874
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:08,132
Bye.

875
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:12,443
You heard something,
didn't you?

876
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:13,432
Yeah.

877
00:35:14,145 --> 00:35:15,446
Roz, are you
all right?
Of course not.

878
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:18,449
She's ashen with terror.
Spit it out, Roz.

879
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:20,144
Who's the
jack-booted tyrant

880
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:23,154
whose fanny I'll be kissing till God knows when?

881
00:35:23,154 --> 00:35:25,156
Me.

882
00:35:25,156 --> 00:35:28,353
Joyful news, Your Majesty.

883
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:30,628
You?

884
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:33,131
Roz, congratulatio
ns. Aren't you excited?

885
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:35,133
I don't know. I...
It just hasn't sunk in yet.

886
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:36,134
That's understandable.

887
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:37,624
I remember when I
heard that my advice

888
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:39,137
...
would be heard by
millions of people

889
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:41,230
It just sunk in!
I'm the boss!

890
00:35:41,405 --> 00:35:43,174
Who wants to go have champagne?

891
00:35:43,174 --> 00:35:44,475
Oh, gosh, Roz,
I'd love to,

892
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:45,476
but I have to go to
a doctor's appointment.

893
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:47,171
Can you come to my place
for dinner tonight?

894
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:49,180
Sure.

895
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:51,478
I'm so happy for
you.
I'm just so excited.

896
00:35:57,722 --> 00:36:00,213
(breathing heavily)

897
00:36:09,734 --> 00:36:12,726
Well, was that worth
waiting for?

898
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:17,296
He asked you
a question, Roz.

899
00:36:23,447 --> 00:36:24,916
Bebe, it's Frasier.

900
00:36:24,916 --> 00:36:26,417
When you get this,
call me please.

901
00:36:26,417 --> 00:36:27,818
I want to thank you
for sending me

902
00:36:27,818 --> 00:36:29,820
to that quack of yours today.

903
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:33,654
He screwed something up and now
my eyes won't stop watering.

904
00:36:33,891 --> 00:36:35,960
There she is.

905
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,461
Congratulations.

906
00:36:37,461 --> 00:36:39,452
And to you.

907
00:36:39,897 --> 00:36:41,489
Hey, does anyone know
what this big occasion is?

908
00:36:41,966 --> 00:36:43,467
We had plans
and Frasier made us cancel.

909
00:36:43,467 --> 00:36:44,969
We're not sure either.

910
00:36:44,969 --> 00:36:46,337
He said he had some sort
of an announcement to make.

911
00:36:46,337 --> 00:36:47,304
Hey, Roz.

912
00:36:47,805 --> 00:36:50,296
Aw, there he is.

913
00:36:50,808 --> 00:36:51,797
Oh!

914
00:36:53,911 --> 00:36:56,480
Hey, David...

915
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,483
Remember me?
I'm your grandpa.

916
00:36:59,483 --> 00:37:01,485
Yes, and I'm your...

917
00:37:01,485 --> 00:37:03,976
Sorry. I just...
I can't say it yet.

918
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:06,481
Frasier, I brought
some champagne if...

919
00:37:06,791 --> 00:37:07,849
Were you just crying?

920
00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:09,994
No. No, Roz,
of course not.

921
00:37:09,994 --> 00:37:11,562
Could you take
these out for me?

922
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:13,257
Sure.
Thank you.

923
00:37:15,466 --> 00:37:18,502
Is Frasier okay?

924
00:37:18,502 --> 00:37:20,493
Sure. Why?

925
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:22,640
Well, I think he was crying
in the kitchen.

926
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,342
I hope he's okay.

927
00:37:24,342 --> 00:37:25,502
He's been to the doctor
an awful lot lately.

928
00:37:25,843 --> 00:37:27,310
Has he?

929
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:30,348
Yeah. He went today.
And he missed a whole show

930
00:37:30,348 --> 00:37:32,016
because of an appointment
last week.

931
00:37:32,016 --> 00:37:33,745
He hasn't said anything to us.

932
00:37:34,385 --> 00:37:35,353
Ronee,

933
00:37:35,353 --> 00:37:38,923
I saw you admiring
this china pattern.

934
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:40,322
Oh, yeah, it's beautiful.

935
00:37:40,491 --> 00:37:43,551
Well, I'd like to make
a gift of them to you.

936
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:45,563
There's a complete set.

937
00:37:45,563 --> 00:37:46,931
Gosh, Frasier.

938
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,466
Thank you.

939
00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:49,967
Oh, Niles...

940
00:37:49,967 --> 00:37:52,036
I know how much
you've always coveted

941
00:37:52,036 --> 00:37:54,538
this chess set.

942
00:37:54,538 --> 00:37:56,040
I want you to have it.

943
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,541
But this is your favorite.

944
00:37:57,541 --> 00:37:59,043
This is the one
you learned on.

945
00:37:59,043 --> 00:38:00,544
Which is why I want
it to be the set

946
00:38:00,544 --> 00:38:02,535
that you teach that son
of yours to play on.

947
00:38:04,548 --> 00:38:06,317
I haven't forgotten
about you, Roz.

948
00:38:06,317 --> 00:38:07,614
I'll be right back.

949
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,888
I don't like this.

950
00:38:10,888 --> 00:38:12,690
Well, now let'
s not get alarmed.

951
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:14,692
Marriage in the air
and a new baby...

952
00:38:14,692 --> 00:38:16,661
it's just brought out
his sentimental side.

953
00:38:16,661 --> 00:38:18,458
(telephone rings)

954
00:38:23,434 --> 00:38:24,735
(over answering machine):
Frasier, it's Dr. Hanning.

955
00:38:24,735 --> 00:38:26,600
I'm really sorry
about your results.

956
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:29,068
I know it doesn't look good,

957
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,741
but I'm going to do everything l can for you.

958
00:38:30,741 --> 00:38:32,606
Call me.

959
00:38:32,843 --> 00:38:34,333
(beep)

960
00:38:36,447 --> 00:38:37,648
Oh, my God.

961
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:40,551
You think that's why he
brought us all here tonight?

962
00:38:40,551 --> 00:38:41,952
Here we are, Roz.

963
00:38:41,952 --> 00:38:45,489
I thought this art deco mirror
seemed like you.

964
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:49,360
(cries)

965
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,554
That just shows you.

966
00:38:51,062 --> 00:38:54,332
I thought I'd get
the bigger reaction
from the chess set.

967
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:57,435
Frasier, what'
s going on here?

968
00:38:57,435 --> 00:38:58,669
Yeah, giving all
your stuff away...

969
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:01,739
you're not going
anywhere, are you?

970
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:04,475
Well, I didn't want to say
anything until after dinner,

971
00:39:04,475 --> 00:39:06,577
so as not to bring down
the party, but...

972
00:39:06,577 --> 00:39:07,635
(groans)

973
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,916
I see you're
all ahead of me.

974
00:39:11,916 --> 00:39:16,353
Listen, a couple of weeks ago
I got some unexpected news.

975
00:39:16,787 --> 00:39:18,755
(sobs)

976
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:22,093
Now, you see, this
is exactly what I
was trying to avoid.

977
00:39:22,093 --> 00:39:25,830
You mustn't think
of my leaving you
as a sad thing,

978
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:27,365
because I don't.

979
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:29,400
I think of it as an adventure.

980
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,802
(cries):
Oh, Frasier, no...

981
00:39:31,802 --> 00:39:33,838
Look, we all knew we weren't
going to stay together forever.

982
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:35,533
That's not what life is about.

983
00:39:35,806 --> 00:39:39,367
Cry if you must,
but I assure you

984
00:39:39,443 --> 00:39:43,504
when I pass through that
Golden Gate, I will be smiling.

985
00:39:45,649 --> 00:39:47,418
..
(choked up):
Golden gate.

986
00:39:47,418 --> 00:39:48,419
Yes.

987
00:39:48,419 --> 00:39:50,717
That's where I'm moving
to, San Francisco.

988
00:39:52,757 --> 00:39:53,849
What?

989
00:39:54,525 --> 00:39:55,559
My new job.

990
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:57,661
I start next week.

991
00:39:57,661 --> 00:40:00,164
Now don't just sit there
choking back the tears.

992
00:40:00,164 --> 00:40:01,654
Go ahead. Let them out.

993
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:05,431
I can't believe it!
(laughing)

994
00:40:09,173 --> 00:40:10,674
To San Francisco.

995
00:40:10,674 --> 00:40:12,164
To San Francisco.
To San Francisco.

996
00:40:20,184 --> 00:40:21,685
You know, it's just
an hour by plane,

997
00:40:21,685 --> 00:40:24,188
so I'll be coming back up
as often as you like.

998
00:40:24,188 --> 00:40:25,689
Oh, we know, Fras.
Don't worry about us.

999
00:40:25,689 --> 00:40:27,179
We're happy for you.

1000
00:40:27,691 --> 00:40:30,194
I'm happy for myself...

1001
00:40:30,194 --> 00:40:33,197
and scared, too.
But it's a good scared.

1002
00:40:33,197 --> 00:40:36,189
Sort of the way I felt
when I came here from Boston.

1003
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,202
But if I hadn't done that,

1004
00:40:38,202 --> 00:40:40,693
.
just look at what
I would've missed out on

1005
00:40:41,205 --> 00:40:43,207
And...

1006
00:40:43,207 --> 00:40:46,699
Iook what I would've missed out on.

1007
00:40:47,211 --> 00:40:49,580
God, they are
so beautiful.

1008
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:51,048
And they'll stay like that

1009
00:40:51,048 --> 00:40:53,039
as long as she keeps
breast-feeding.

1010
00:40:58,522 --> 00:41:02,526
Niles, could you take the baby?
I need to get a blanket.

1011
00:41:02,526 --> 00:41:03,515
Sure.

1012
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:14,062
.
This is pretty comfortable.
I would've been okay with this

1013
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:23,470
Let me just help you
with some of those dishes.

1014
00:41:25,916 --> 00:41:27,747
Oh, handsome boy.

1015
00:41:28,252 --> 00:41:29,520
Yes.

1016
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:33,624
And to think I had myself
all worked up

1017
00:41:33,624 --> 00:41:35,759
worrying that we would have
nothing in common.

1018
00:41:35,759 --> 00:41:38,529
Oh, I've been there, Niles.

1019
00:41:38,529 --> 00:41:40,087
It all works out.

1020
00:41:42,867 --> 00:41:44,602
Well, Marty,
we better get going.

1021
00:41:44,602 --> 00:41:46,537
I got a crazy
morning.

1022
00:41:46,537 --> 00:41:48,606
Me, too.
I've got a 7:30 meeting

1023
00:41:48,606 --> 00:41:50,608
and then I've got
to fire someone.

1024
00:41:50,608 --> 00:41:51,597
Who?

1025
00:41:51,909 --> 00:41:53,900
Whoever scheduled
the 7:30 meeting.

1026
00:41:55,546 --> 00:41:56,604
We should go, too, honey.

1027
00:41:57,114 --> 00:41:58,581
If you really must
go, all right,

1028
00:41:59,116 --> 00:42:00,584
but I'll tell you what.

1029
00:42:00,584 --> 00:42:02,119
Don't go without taking some
of these eclairs with you.

1030
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:03,587
I'm on TV next week.

1031
00:42:03,587 --> 00:42:05,111
The only thing worse
than them go to waste

1032
00:42:05,589 --> 00:42:07,580
would be seeing them
go to my waist.

1033
00:42:08,125 --> 00:42:10,685
(chuckles)

1034
00:42:12,062 --> 00:42:13,029
What?

1035
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:17,167
It just hit me.
You're really leaving.

1036
00:42:17,167 --> 00:42:20,967
What will I ever do
without you?

1037
00:42:21,305 --> 00:42:24,240
You're the sweetest,
most wonderful...

1038
00:42:24,642 --> 00:42:26,610
It's okay, Roz.
He's not going till next week.

1039
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:28,043
Let her talk, Dad.

1040
00:42:30,247 --> 00:42:33,551
You've always been
just like a brother to me.

1041
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:35,853
Which is weird, I know,
because we slept together,

1042
00:42:35,853 --> 00:42:36,842
but... well, you know.

1043
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:40,948
Oh, move over, Roz.

1044
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:45,318
You know how many operas
I'm going to get dragged to

1045
00:42:45,796 --> 00:42:46,931
now you're not around?

1046
00:42:46,931 --> 00:42:50,890
I promise I'll fly up
for all the German ones.

1047
00:42:51,168 --> 00:42:53,737
And he'll be here for Christmas
and Thanksgiving and birthdays.

1048
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:55,728
We'll be sick of this guy.
Dad's right.

1049
00:42:56,106 --> 00:42:58,768
Once I'm gone, there'?
I be no getting rid of me.

1050
00:42:58,842 --> 00:42:59,934
(chuckles)

1051
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:04,608
Thank you, Frasier,

1052
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:07,748
for... well, you know.

1053
00:43:13,123 --> 00:43:14,613
Go get 'em, kid.
Sure.

1054
00:43:17,628 --> 00:43:19,630
You already made me
cry once tonight.

1055
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:21,598
That's quite enough.

1056
00:43:21,799 --> 00:43:23,767
Right. Coffee tomorrow?

1057
00:43:23,867 --> 00:43:25,960
10:30.

1058
00:43:26,637 --> 00:43:28,662
I'll miss the coffees.

1059
00:43:31,875 --> 00:43:34,144
Now, look...

1060
00:43:34,144 --> 00:43:36,203
you all know
how I feel about you.

1061
00:43:39,316 --> 00:43:40,851
The only reason
I'm leaving is because

1062
00:43:40,851 --> 00:43:45,345
I want what all of you
have now, a new chapter.

1063
00:43:46,824 --> 00:43:49,326
Who knows if it'll
even work out?

1064
00:43:49,326 --> 00:43:52,329
But it's like that Tennyson po
Mom had us recite for you

1065
00:43:52,329 --> 00:43:54,331
when we were kids.
You remember?

1066
00:43:54,331 --> 00:43:57,868
I think we're about to.

1067
00:43:57,868 --> 00:44:03,307
"It may be the gulfs
will wash us down,

1068
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:07,244
"It may be we shall touch
the happy isles,

1069
00:44:07,244 --> 00:44:08,711
"And though we are not now
that strength

1070
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:13,640
"which in old days
moved earth and heaven,

1071
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:16,854
"That which we are, we are...

1072
00:44:16,854 --> 00:44:20,858
"...Made weak by time and fate,

1073
00:44:20,858 --> 00:44:23,360
"but strong in will

1074
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:29,733
"To strive, to seek, to find,

1075
00:44:29,733 --> 00:44:32,201
and not to yield. "

1076
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:40,377
I've been thinking about
that poem a lot lately.

1077
00:44:40,377 --> 00:44:42,312
And I think what it says

1078
00:44:42,312 --> 00:44:45,082
is that while it's tempting to play it safe,

1079
00:44:45,082 --> 00:44:48,779
the more we're willing to risk
the more alive we are.

1080
00:44:49,086 --> 00:44:52,790
In the end, what we regret most

1081
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:56,093
are the chances we never took.

1082
00:44:56,093 --> 00:44:59,096
And I hope that explains,
at least a little,

1083
00:44:59,096 --> 00:45:04,101
this journey on which
I'm about to embark.

1084
00:45:04,101 --> 00:45:08,806
I have loved every minute

1085
00:45:08,806 --> 00:45:12,105
with my KACL family
and all of you.

1086
00:45:16,113 --> 00:45:21,118
For 1 1 years you've heard
me say, "I'm listening. "

1087
00:45:21,118 --> 00:45:24,788
Well, you were listening, too.

1088
00:45:24,788 --> 00:45:27,757
And for that
I am eternally grateful.

1089
00:45:30,861 --> 00:45:32,920
Good night, Seattle.

1090
00:45:35,933 --> 00:45:37,924
We had a big party that nigh
t. It was all very sweet.

1091
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:38,929
(small thud)

1092
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:40,237
What was that?

1093
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:41,939
Oh, good heavens.

1094
00:45:41,939 --> 00:45:42,940
We've touched down.

1095
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:44,942
Already?

1096
00:45:44,942 --> 00:45:47,911
Well, thank you so much.
I've never had an easier flight.

1097
00:45:47,911 --> 00:45:51,074
And I've never had m
ore delightful company.

1098
00:45:51,482 --> 00:45:54,318
I think it's great
what you're doing.

1099
00:45:54,318 --> 00:45:56,086
it
Well, I just know
I'd always regret

1100
00:45:56,086 --> 00:45:57,988
if I didn't take the chance.

1101
00:45:57,988 --> 00:46:02,826
FLIGHT A TTENDANT:
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Chicago.

1102
00:46:02,826 --> 00:46:05,395
Wish me luck.
