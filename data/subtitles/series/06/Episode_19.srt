1
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:13,136
Dr. Crane, I just wanted to tell you
how much I miss your show.

2
00:00:13,302 --> 00:00:16,097
Oh, well, thank you so much.
I miss it too.

3
00:00:16,305 --> 00:00:17,640
Yes, the brisk exchange of ideas,

4
00:00:17,807 --> 00:00:20,685
the crackling interplay
between me and my callers.

5
00:00:25,398 --> 00:00:26,440
Well, you're very kind.

6
00:00:28,568 --> 00:00:31,070
See that, Roz? The public
still craves the kind of excitement

7
00:00:31,237 --> 00:00:32,947
that only Frasier Crane can provide.

8
00:00:34,282 --> 00:00:36,200
Roz!

9
00:00:37,827 --> 00:00:39,287
I am so sorry.

10
00:00:39,495 --> 00:00:41,455
The baby kept me up
all night long last night.

11
00:00:41,622 --> 00:00:46,210
I'm trying to get her used to her crib,
but she just hates to sleep alone.

12
00:00:46,419 --> 00:00:48,421
Well, the acorn certainly
doesn't fall far from...

13
00:00:48,587 --> 00:00:52,466
I have got to wake up.
I'm on my way to an interview.

14
00:00:52,633 --> 00:00:56,220
I'd kill for a cup of regular coffee,
but I'm still nursing, so I can't.

15
00:00:56,387 --> 00:00:58,889
You know, it was just all I could do
to get myself dressed

16
00:00:59,056 --> 00:01:00,808
and then feed the baby
this morning.

17
00:01:01,016 --> 00:01:02,059
Yes, well, next time,

18
00:01:02,226 --> 00:01:04,770
maybe you should try feeding first
and dressing second.

19
00:01:04,937 --> 00:01:06,397
- Oh, my God!
- Yes.

20
00:01:06,564 --> 00:01:09,108
- How did I miss this?
- Well...

21
00:01:09,275 --> 00:01:12,611
On the plus side, it does divert the eye
from the blueberries in your teeth.

22
00:01:12,778 --> 00:01:15,072
What? I can't go
to this interview like this.

23
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:17,741
- Of course you can.
- Oh, I'm just gonna call and cancel.

24
00:01:17,908 --> 00:01:20,661
No, Roz, no, please, just check
your teeth, yes, put your jacket on,

25
00:01:20,869 --> 00:01:24,456
and I swear, you'll look every inch
the smart career gal on the go.

26
00:01:24,665 --> 00:01:25,708
- There.
- Thanks, Frasier.

27
00:01:25,874 --> 00:01:28,460
Hey, Roz. Is that the newest thing,
wearing two different shoes?

28
00:01:28,627 --> 00:01:31,130
Oh, my God!

29
00:01:31,922 --> 00:01:33,882
Hi, Dad. So, what brings you here?

30
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:35,968
Well, I thought you needed
a little cheering up.

31
00:01:36,135 --> 00:01:37,469
You've been kind of mopey lately.

32
00:01:37,636 --> 00:01:40,681
Well, I had kind of a rough night
at the wine club.

33
00:01:40,889 --> 00:01:42,891
During the blindfolded tasting,

34
00:01:43,058 --> 00:01:46,436
I gave four stars
to a Mexican Zinfandel.

35
00:01:47,271 --> 00:01:48,689
Well, I don't just mean last night.

36
00:01:48,856 --> 00:01:51,900
I mean, you've been kind of down ever
since you lost your job, you know?

37
00:01:52,067 --> 00:01:54,653
And you haven't had a date
in I don't know how long.

38
00:01:54,861 --> 00:01:57,114
I know how long,
and this isn't the way to cheer me up.

39
00:01:57,281 --> 00:01:58,824
Don't worry. I found a girl for you.

40
00:01:58,991 --> 00:02:01,076
Now, Duke's daughter Marie
just moved back in town...

41
00:02:01,243 --> 00:02:03,870
Dad, blind dates remain
the refuge of the lovelorn.

42
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,040
If you didn't talk like that, you might
not have to get set up so much.

43
00:02:07,457 --> 00:02:09,918
Now, listen, she's not a blind date.
You know Marie.

44
00:02:10,085 --> 00:02:13,088
- Spent a week with her at the lake.
- She was 6 years old!

45
00:02:13,296 --> 00:02:14,965
Duke said she's grown
into a real looker.

46
00:02:15,132 --> 00:02:16,466
Yes, well, I have seen Duke.

47
00:02:16,675 --> 00:02:19,010
And unless he sired a love child
with Catherine Deneuve,

48
00:02:19,177 --> 00:02:21,221
I don't like my odds.

49
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,599
- Uncle Martin!
- Oh, Marie!

50
00:02:24,766 --> 00:02:28,061
Look at you. You remember Frasier?

51
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:29,396
<i>Bonjour!</i>

52
00:02:37,278 --> 00:02:39,531
I don't know when I've had
such a delicious meal.

53
00:02:39,698 --> 00:02:41,324
You really made this dessert
yourself?

54
00:02:41,491 --> 00:02:46,371
Well, yes. It's a little something
I like to call Crane brûlée.

55
00:02:48,289 --> 00:02:49,833
You always were a gourmet.

56
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:51,876
Even at the lake,
whenever we had fish sticks,

57
00:02:52,043 --> 00:02:54,295
you insisted on white grape juice.

58
00:02:58,299 --> 00:03:00,385
Is everything all right there?

59
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:04,264
It's just a little quirk of mine.

60
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:07,725
I like to keep things straight,
you know, in parallel lines.

61
00:03:07,892 --> 00:03:10,478
Yes, I noticed that earlier
with the asparagus.

62
00:03:12,563 --> 00:03:15,024
It's weird, I know.
It used to drive my mother crazy.

63
00:03:15,233 --> 00:03:17,402
Well, you know, we all have
our little idiosyncrasies.

64
00:03:17,568 --> 00:03:19,654
- How is your mother, anyway?
- Still on my case.

65
00:03:19,821 --> 00:03:23,574
After the divorce,
things just got worse.

66
00:03:27,578 --> 00:03:32,250
Oh, I'm doing it again, aren't I?
I'm sorry. I'll stop.

67
00:03:32,834 --> 00:03:34,460
Look.

68
00:03:36,003 --> 00:03:39,173
Anyway, I haven't figured out how
to have a normal relationship with her.

69
00:03:39,382 --> 00:03:43,177
You know, we're all striving to have
what we call "normal" relationships.

70
00:03:43,344 --> 00:03:45,096
But who really knows
what normal is?

71
00:03:45,304 --> 00:03:48,349
- You can move it back now.
- Thank you.

72
00:03:49,809 --> 00:03:51,936
What do you say we have our wine
out on the balcony?

73
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,729
- The balcony?
- Yes.

74
00:03:53,938 --> 00:03:56,482
You haven't had a chance
to see the view.

75
00:03:57,483 --> 00:04:02,446
Wow! That is some view, all right.
Beautiful.

76
00:04:03,364 --> 00:04:07,076
- You're afraid of heights, aren't you?
- I'm taking classes.

77
00:04:08,035 --> 00:04:09,495
They give us these exercises to do.

78
00:04:09,662 --> 00:04:13,457
They just work better when
you're standing on a little milk crate.

79
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:18,045
Oh, I must seem totally neurotic.

80
00:04:18,254 --> 00:04:20,172
Not at all.

81
00:04:20,673 --> 00:04:23,175
I guess I'm going a little nuts
since I moved in with my dad.

82
00:04:23,342 --> 00:04:25,177
Thank God,
I'm getting my own place next week.

83
00:04:25,386 --> 00:04:27,513
Oh, yes, well,
I suspect that will help a lot.

84
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,640
You know, very often,
the key to mental health

85
00:04:29,807 --> 00:04:32,226
is distancing ourselves
from our parents.

86
00:04:32,434 --> 00:04:34,770
I'm home. Oh, hey!

87
00:04:37,981 --> 00:04:39,233
Sorry to barge in on you kids.

88
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,485
That's all right.
Why don't you join us for dessert?

89
00:04:41,693 --> 00:04:45,864
Oh, thanks anyway,
but I had Crane brûlée for lunch.

90
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,450
I did a little dry run earlier.

91
00:04:48,617 --> 00:04:51,286
I wanted to make sure my carameliser
wasn't on the fritz.

92
00:04:51,495 --> 00:04:53,830
I was proud the first time
he brought that blowtorch home

93
00:04:53,997 --> 00:04:55,791
- until I saw what it was for.
- Dad!

94
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:59,294
Oh, no, I'm only joking.
She knows that.

95
00:04:59,461 --> 00:05:01,171
He's a great kid, Marie.

96
00:05:01,338 --> 00:05:05,175
I mean, sure, he's out of work now,
but he's hit the skids a lot of times,

97
00:05:05,384 --> 00:05:08,595
and he always manages
to bounce right back up.

98
00:05:08,804 --> 00:05:11,348
I think you've sprinkled enough
pixie dust for one evening.

99
00:05:11,556 --> 00:05:13,308
Okay. Okay.

100
00:05:14,059 --> 00:05:15,560
Well, good night, you two.

101
00:05:15,769 --> 00:05:19,272
- I should probably get going too.
- All right.

102
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:21,483
Thank you for a great evening.

103
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:24,569
And for all the wonderful advice.
It was very insightful.

104
00:05:24,778 --> 00:05:26,655
You're quite welcome, Marie.

105
00:05:26,822 --> 00:05:32,452
Perhaps you can offer me
a little insight as well.

106
00:05:33,036 --> 00:05:36,539
Will this be our only night together
or will I see you again?

107
00:05:36,748 --> 00:05:39,042
Well, you're pretty good
at interpreting things.

108
00:05:39,209 --> 00:05:41,044
Maybe this will answer
your question.

109
00:05:54,641 --> 00:05:56,309
Well, then, you have a nice life.

110
00:06:00,855 --> 00:06:05,109
And just as this hunter catches up
to me and is about to kill me,

111
00:06:05,318 --> 00:06:08,988
I wake up on the cot in my dad's
oak-panelled rumpus room.

112
00:06:09,197 --> 00:06:12,617
That is a terrifying nightmare.

113
00:06:12,867 --> 00:06:14,786
Are there any other figures
in the rumpus room?

114
00:06:14,994 --> 00:06:18,456
No, that's not part of the dream.
I really sleep there.

115
00:06:19,457 --> 00:06:22,543
I wish I didn't have to go. Can we talk
about this after the museum tonight?

116
00:06:22,752 --> 00:06:24,754
Oh, of course.
I thought it was the opera tonight.

117
00:06:24,921 --> 00:06:26,047
No, the museum opening.

118
00:06:26,214 --> 00:06:28,383
You promised me in the shower
this morning, remember?

119
00:06:28,549 --> 00:06:29,967
Yes.

120
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:32,595
But I was under duress.
You had a loofah to my head.

121
00:06:39,936 --> 00:06:41,979
Oh, Niles,
you just missed Duke's daughter.

122
00:06:42,146 --> 00:06:43,648
I saw!

123
00:06:43,856 --> 00:06:45,566
Is it possible that's the same little girl

124
00:06:45,733 --> 00:06:47,443
we used to refer to as
"The Ugly Dukeling"?

125
00:06:51,656 --> 00:06:53,824
- She is stunning.
- Isn't she, though?

126
00:06:54,033 --> 00:06:55,534
You know, the insecure part of me

127
00:06:55,701 --> 00:06:57,870
has trouble figuring out
why she's going out with me.

128
00:06:58,037 --> 00:07:00,498
I mean,
she could have her pick of men.

129
00:07:01,165 --> 00:07:04,001
And I am a little older, haven't been
to the gym as often as I should,

130
00:07:04,168 --> 00:07:07,254
and you can feel free to contradict me
anytime you like, Niles.

131
00:07:07,588 --> 00:07:10,091
You must have something,
because she's clearly charmed by you.

132
00:07:10,257 --> 00:07:11,509
Yes, well, whatever the reason,

133
00:07:11,675 --> 00:07:14,428
we certainly have
the most wonderful time together.

134
00:07:14,637 --> 00:07:15,971
We have the greatest discussions.

135
00:07:16,138 --> 00:07:18,307
I've been helping her sort
through some of her issues.

136
00:07:18,474 --> 00:07:19,642
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

137
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:21,936
It's a very complex relationship
with her mother

138
00:07:22,102 --> 00:07:26,106
which has given rise to several striking
phobias and a recurring dream.

139
00:07:26,273 --> 00:07:29,526
And the most charming little
obsessive-compulsive disorder.

140
00:07:30,152 --> 00:07:32,196
Oh, well, then, there you go.

141
00:07:32,655 --> 00:07:36,116
Perhaps she's attracted to you
because of your psychiatric expertise.

142
00:07:36,825 --> 00:07:38,327
Well, what are you suggesting,
Niles?

143
00:07:38,494 --> 00:07:40,788
That Marie's going out with me
just to get free therapy?

144
00:07:40,996 --> 00:07:43,916
- Well, it was just a thought.
- That's a mean-spirited thought.

145
00:07:44,124 --> 00:07:45,334
Marie's not using me.

146
00:07:45,501 --> 00:07:48,212
She would want me just as much
even if I weren't a psychiatrist.

147
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:50,672
Why, you're jealous.
You're jealous that I'm having sex.

148
00:07:50,881 --> 00:07:53,300
Jealous that I'm having hot,
passionate, sweaty, jungle sex.

149
00:07:53,467 --> 00:07:55,344
What are you having?

150
00:07:58,263 --> 00:08:00,140
I'm having a latte.

151
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:06,897
Will this be all right for you?

152
00:08:07,064 --> 00:08:09,066
Is there enough light here
for you to see her?

153
00:08:09,274 --> 00:08:11,902
Yeah, I'm telling you, Phil,
she's really cute.

154
00:08:12,069 --> 00:08:14,488
You'll see for yourself
in a couple of minutes.

155
00:08:14,655 --> 00:08:17,657
Oh, wait. She's coming in now.
I gotta go.

156
00:08:20,494 --> 00:08:22,245
- Hey, Daphne, how's it going?
- Fine.

157
00:08:22,412 --> 00:08:24,247
- Good.
- What are you so chipper about?

158
00:08:24,456 --> 00:08:27,125
Oh, nothing. It's a beautiful night out.

159
00:08:27,292 --> 00:08:29,961
Say, why don't you come out and
have a look at the moon with me?

160
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:33,465
- Why, is it full?
- I don't know.

161
00:08:34,007 --> 00:08:35,967
All right.

162
00:08:39,721 --> 00:08:43,516
- It's a beaut, isn't it?
- Oh, yeah, very romantic.

163
00:08:43,725 --> 00:08:45,352
Now, wait! Wait!
Come here, come here.

164
00:08:45,518 --> 00:08:47,395
I gotta show you something else too.
Over here.

165
00:08:48,021 --> 00:08:51,983
Look at that, the way the moonbeams
bounce off that reflecting pool.

166
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:55,945
Oh, yeah, that's really something.

167
00:08:59,199 --> 00:09:00,742
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

168
00:09:00,909 --> 00:09:02,077
- Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not.

169
00:09:02,243 --> 00:09:03,411
- Yes, you are.
- I'm not.

170
00:09:03,578 --> 00:09:04,746
You're signalling to someone.

171
00:09:05,413 --> 00:09:08,041
Well, all right.
I did such a good job with Frasier,

172
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:10,502
I thought maybe I could fix you up
with some nice guy.

173
00:09:11,252 --> 00:09:13,087
Is it that man up there
with the binoculars?

174
00:09:13,254 --> 00:09:14,631
Yeah, isn't that a great building?

175
00:09:14,797 --> 00:09:16,507
He does real well.
He owns half that floor.

176
00:09:16,674 --> 00:09:18,134
- Mr. Crane!
- What?

177
00:09:18,343 --> 00:09:19,385
I don't believe it!

178
00:09:19,552 --> 00:09:21,429
Putting me on display,
like a bloody concubine!

179
00:09:21,596 --> 00:09:22,847
Well, you get a turn too.

180
00:09:23,014 --> 00:09:26,726
I got this telescope set up
so you could have a look at him.

181
00:09:26,893 --> 00:09:29,520
See, he liked you. Hello?

182
00:09:29,687 --> 00:09:32,940
Yeah, well, I told you she was pretty.

183
00:09:33,107 --> 00:09:34,942
What do you mean,
can I show you another one?

184
00:09:35,109 --> 00:09:37,612
What do you think I'm running here?

185
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:40,698
So there I am,
actually biting the fingernails

186
00:09:40,865 --> 00:09:42,617
of the same hand
that's holding the phone,

187
00:09:42,784 --> 00:09:45,119
not two minutes after
I'm on with my mother.

188
00:09:45,286 --> 00:09:50,082
- Isn't that so revealing?
- Well, yes. Yes, I'd say it is.

189
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:53,336
Is everything okay, Frasier?
You seem a little quiet.

190
00:09:53,878 --> 00:09:57,590
No, no, I was just so enjoying
our museum chat,

191
00:09:57,757 --> 00:10:01,260
I was wondering how we got on
to the subject of mothers.

192
00:10:01,761 --> 00:10:04,722
Well, it was a Whistler exhibit.

193
00:10:06,766 --> 00:10:10,478
Yes, yes, I'm sorry.
I guess I'm just a bit tense.

194
00:10:10,644 --> 00:10:13,147
Why didn't you say something?
I'll give you a little massage.

195
00:10:13,314 --> 00:10:15,775
Oh, really? Well, all right,
if you think that'll help.

196
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:22,156
It's such an amazing feeling, being
in the presence of so much beauty.

197
00:10:22,364 --> 00:10:23,657
Yes, well, you say that now.

198
00:10:23,824 --> 00:10:26,493
In six weeks,
you'll be telling me to lose weight.

199
00:10:29,955 --> 00:10:32,249
The Whistler, I know, I know.

200
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:34,543
Gosh, isn't it great
that we both enjoy art so much?

201
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:38,339
- I could just talk about it all night.
- Me too.

202
00:10:38,672 --> 00:10:42,926
Oh, you know, I couldn't help noticing
your staring at that riverscape.

203
00:10:43,093 --> 00:10:44,636
You couldn't take your eyes off of it.

204
00:10:44,803 --> 00:10:48,682
Yeah, I think it's because it
reminded me of my recurring dream.

205
00:10:48,849 --> 00:10:51,435
You know, we were gonna talk
more about that.

206
00:10:51,602 --> 00:10:57,274
Oh, yes, yes. The dream, being
pursued by the hunter and the arrows.

207
00:10:57,441 --> 00:11:00,569
- Yeah.
- Well...

208
00:11:00,736 --> 00:11:04,281
You know, I'm not really feeling up
to talking about it right now.

209
00:11:04,448 --> 00:11:06,325
Do you think we could do it
some other night?

210
00:11:07,743 --> 00:11:09,536
All right.

211
00:11:12,664 --> 00:11:14,166
What did you think
of the riverscape?

212
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:16,752
Oh, well, I enjoyed it.

213
00:11:16,918 --> 00:11:19,588
I was also enjoying
what you were doing just now.

214
00:11:19,796 --> 00:11:23,050
I'm sorry. My hands were just
getting a little bit of a cramp.

215
00:11:23,258 --> 00:11:24,676
Oh, well, then let me do you, then.

216
00:11:24,843 --> 00:11:27,846
Oh, actually, it's getting late.
You know, maybe I should get home.

217
00:11:28,055 --> 00:11:29,473
Thought you were
spending the night.

218
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:32,684
Oh, I'd like to, but I have
an early morning and I hate to rush.

219
00:11:33,435 --> 00:11:34,644
I had a great evening tonight.

220
00:11:34,811 --> 00:11:39,566
You know, about that dream,
I did have one thought.

221
00:11:39,774 --> 00:11:41,651
- Really?
- Yes.

222
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:48,241
Forest imagery very often represents
our most primal emotions,

223
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:50,827
hence its frequent use in fairy tales,

224
00:11:51,036 --> 00:11:53,204
which could be a link
to your childhood.

225
00:11:54,122 --> 00:11:58,460
You are so good at this.
Much better than my therapist.

226
00:11:58,626 --> 00:12:02,213
- You have a therapist?
- Oh, not anymore. Who can afford it?

227
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:06,468
Anyway, you know,
my hands are feeling much better.

228
00:12:06,634 --> 00:12:08,386
Why don't we give that massage
another shot?

229
00:12:08,553 --> 00:12:09,929
Oh, yeah.

230
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:15,059
So I noticed that I often have this
dream right after I talk to my mother.

231
00:12:15,226 --> 00:12:20,231
Boy, your muscles are so tense.
Is it just your neck or all over?

232
00:12:20,398 --> 00:12:22,775
It's all over.

233
00:12:27,697 --> 00:12:31,034
Frasier, Frasier,
you will not believe this.

234
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,995
Little Alice said her first word today.
It was "ma."

235
00:12:34,203 --> 00:12:35,246
Or it may have been "moo."

236
00:12:35,413 --> 00:12:37,790
Mary, that's the sitter,
gave her this little toy cow.

237
00:12:37,999 --> 00:12:40,251
She's always doing stuff like that.
I love Mary.

238
00:12:40,418 --> 00:12:42,503
I love this little cow too.

239
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:44,714
It's the cutest little thing.
It's brown and white.

240
00:12:44,881 --> 00:12:47,383
That's a Jersey cow, right?
That's where Mary's from, Jersey.

241
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:50,261
Yeah! I'll take a splash more.

242
00:12:51,179 --> 00:12:54,473
You know, I stopped nursing yesterday
and, boy, have I missed this stuff.

243
00:12:54,682 --> 00:12:56,475
Cup of mud, java, my old friend joe.

244
00:12:56,642 --> 00:12:58,394
That's funny,
Mary's husband's name is Joe.

245
00:12:58,561 --> 00:13:01,147
Oh, my God, he's picking her up.
I gotta go. This has been fun.

246
00:13:01,314 --> 00:13:03,733
You look great.
Nice talking with you.

247
00:13:09,447 --> 00:13:12,074
- Frasier, may I join you?
- Well, of course, Niles.

248
00:13:12,241 --> 00:13:14,493
And I'm sorry about yesterday.

249
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,495
No, no, I'm the one
who should be apologizing.

250
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:18,581
I never meant to suggest
that Marie was...

251
00:13:18,748 --> 00:13:21,584
Niles, Marie and I broke up.

252
00:13:22,376 --> 00:13:25,379
I'm sorry.
Did she at least give you a reason?

253
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:29,717
I broke up with her, but thank you for
the daily shot in the arm of confidence.

254
00:13:29,925 --> 00:13:32,511
I talked to Duke. What the hell
did you break up with Marie for?

255
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:34,597
I'm terribly sorry.
I don't mean to cause a rift

256
00:13:34,763 --> 00:13:37,266
between you and your friend,
but I couldn't continue with it.

257
00:13:37,433 --> 00:13:40,144
You see, once I confirmed that Marie
was primarily interested in me

258
00:13:40,311 --> 00:13:43,689
as a sounding board for her problems,
I just had to end it.

259
00:13:43,897 --> 00:13:45,399
Just as Niles suggested I should.

260
00:13:46,317 --> 00:13:48,193
I never suggested that!

261
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,113
Well, no, all I said
was that one of the things

262
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,907
she might appreciate about you
is your psychiatric expertise.

263
00:13:54,116 --> 00:13:57,077
If you were a world-class chef,
she'd appreciate your cooking.

264
00:13:57,244 --> 00:13:59,747
If you were a stand-up comedian,
she'd appreciate your jokes.

265
00:13:59,913 --> 00:14:02,916
If you were a dermatologist, she had
a big growth coming out of her face...

266
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:04,585
Yes, Dad, I get it. Thank you.

267
00:14:05,627 --> 00:14:08,130
I am sorry, but if you had let
the relationship continue,

268
00:14:08,297 --> 00:14:09,840
she might have found other things

269
00:14:10,007 --> 00:14:12,175
that she'd appreciate about you
just as much.

270
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:14,052
Maybe there's still time
to win her back.

271
00:14:14,261 --> 00:14:16,430
It'd take a pretty big bouquet
of flowers to do that.

272
00:14:16,597 --> 00:14:19,600
I don't know. Maybe if I explain what
really happened, she'll forgive me.

273
00:14:19,766 --> 00:14:21,435
Sometimes the best apology
is the truth.

274
00:14:21,601 --> 00:14:24,604
You'll tell her you thought she was
prostituting herself for therapy,

275
00:14:24,771 --> 00:14:27,566
but now you've decided that's okay?

276
00:14:30,819 --> 00:14:33,488
Well, not that truth.
Some other truth.

277
00:14:40,287 --> 00:14:42,789
- Good evening, Dad.
- Hey, you two. How was dinner?

278
00:14:42,956 --> 00:14:46,501
It was great. We went to my favourite
restaurant, this little Korean barbecue.

279
00:14:46,668 --> 00:14:49,212
Yes, it's just fabulous.
You get to cook your own food

280
00:14:49,379 --> 00:14:51,923
on this little grill that's
right in the centre of the table.

281
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:54,801
It splatters a little bit, but,
you know, that's what makes it fun.

282
00:14:54,968 --> 00:14:57,554
Well, clearly,
you had a marvellous time.

283
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,640
- Oh, hello again, Marie.
- Hi, Niles.

284
00:15:00,849 --> 00:15:02,892
If we're gonna go away,
I should make reservations.

285
00:15:03,059 --> 00:15:06,271
Right. I tell you what, use the phone
in my bedroom. I'll be in in a minute.

286
00:15:06,479 --> 00:15:08,148
Actually, just thinking about
getting away

287
00:15:08,314 --> 00:15:10,817
is making me feel more
relaxed already.

288
00:15:18,491 --> 00:15:20,994
- She has a little problem with heights.
- I saw that.

289
00:15:21,161 --> 00:15:23,997
Well, I'm sure glad you guys
patched things up, anyway.

290
00:15:24,163 --> 00:15:26,249
You know,
Duke and I go back a long way.

291
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:28,793
Got a lot of friends,
but there's something I get from Duke

292
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,379
- that I don't get from anybody else.
- Seahawks tickets.

293
00:15:31,588 --> 00:15:34,590
And don't think that SOB
wasn't ready to pull them, either.

294
00:15:37,719 --> 00:15:40,179
Dad dragged me to one
of those Korean barbecues once.

295
00:15:40,638 --> 00:15:42,348
I've had that suit
dry-cleaned three times.

296
00:15:42,515 --> 00:15:45,727
Eddie still greets me in a carnivorous
frenzy every time I wear it.

297
00:15:47,061 --> 00:15:49,272
Yes, well, the next time Marie
and I go out for dinner,

298
00:15:49,439 --> 00:15:50,648
I'm gonna pick the restaurant,

299
00:15:50,815 --> 00:15:54,152
preferably one where
the stove gets its own room.

300
00:15:54,735 --> 00:15:56,988
Well, she certainly seems
smitten with you.

301
00:15:57,155 --> 00:15:58,781
Yes, she certainly does,
doesn't she?

302
00:15:59,282 --> 00:16:00,825
And I'm quite captivated with her.

303
00:16:00,992 --> 00:16:04,495
You know, I can't put my finger
on exactly why, but...

304
00:16:04,704 --> 00:16:06,581
I'm just glad things
are going well for you.

305
00:16:06,747 --> 00:16:08,249
Are they ever.

306
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:10,960
I find her more enchanting each day.
Oh, you know what?

307
00:16:11,127 --> 00:16:15,423
I am particularly intrigued
by this recurring dream she has.

308
00:16:15,631 --> 00:16:18,384
She's in the woods,
she's being pursued by a hunter.

309
00:16:18,551 --> 00:16:21,303
And get this, when she turns to
confront the pursuer,

310
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:23,931
- the hunter has no face.
- Fascinating.

311
00:16:24,098 --> 00:16:25,766
I'm determined to get to
the bottom of it.

312
00:16:25,933 --> 00:16:28,978
I'm sure it would shed light on her
mother issues and this fear of heights.

313
00:16:29,145 --> 00:16:31,480
Oh, God, I've just discovered
that she absolutely refuses

314
00:16:31,647 --> 00:16:33,941
to touch a doorknob
with her bare hand.

315
00:16:34,108 --> 00:16:37,152
Thanks to my natural chivalry,
I missed that for a whole week.

316
00:16:38,195 --> 00:16:40,406
Is that all you talk about,
her problems?

317
00:16:40,614 --> 00:16:44,368
Well, no, no.
We talk about lots of things.

318
00:16:44,535 --> 00:16:47,246
Art, the theatre. Why?

319
00:16:47,413 --> 00:16:51,375
- Oh, it's just a passing thought.
- Well, pass it over here.

320
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:54,753
Well, you were asking
what most captivated you about her.

321
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:58,215
Perhaps she's giving you a chance to
exercise your psychiatric muscles.

322
00:16:58,424 --> 00:17:01,093
- What?
- You've been out of work for a while.

323
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:06,056
Niles, Marie is a stunning woman
with a body to die for,

324
00:17:06,223 --> 00:17:08,142
and you think all I'm interested in
is her mind?

325
00:17:08,308 --> 00:17:10,644
How shallow do you think I am?

326
00:17:12,604 --> 00:17:14,147
Well, there's no need
to get defensive.

327
00:17:14,314 --> 00:17:18,068
There's not a problem,
unless she's falling in love with you

328
00:17:18,235 --> 00:17:20,862
and you're only interested in her
as a case study.

329
00:17:21,071 --> 00:17:25,659
I assure you, I am interested in all
aspects of Marie, not just her psyche.

330
00:17:25,867 --> 00:17:26,910
For God's sakes, you know,

331
00:17:27,077 --> 00:17:29,329
I could happily go for weeks
without discussing it once.

332
00:17:29,496 --> 00:17:31,164
- Glad to hear it.
- Well, thank you.

333
00:17:31,331 --> 00:17:34,459
If you'll excuse me, I have someone
waiting for me in the other room.

334
00:17:36,545 --> 00:17:39,214
Oh, dear God!
Unhand me, you wretch!

335
00:17:39,381 --> 00:17:43,260
Oh, you vile creature!
Oh, for God's sake, you miserable...

336
00:17:43,427 --> 00:17:46,012
Niles, please,
drop him a Liv-A-Snap!

337
00:17:46,179 --> 00:17:49,182
Oh, let go of me!

338
00:17:49,391 --> 00:17:52,519
Let go of that leg, you...

339
00:17:54,646 --> 00:17:56,982
My father's best friend.

340
00:17:57,566 --> 00:17:59,484
Well, after your father.

341
00:18:00,026 --> 00:18:02,362
We're all booked for this weekend.
There's a lake, hiking.

342
00:18:02,529 --> 00:18:04,030
Sounds like a perfect place to relax.

343
00:18:04,197 --> 00:18:06,199
You know, I do love the country.
It's so relaxing.

344
00:18:06,366 --> 00:18:09,494
I swear to God, I'm out like a light
as soon as my head hits the pillow.

345
00:18:09,703 --> 00:18:13,164
Then we'll have to ask for a room
with no pillows.

346
00:18:13,665 --> 00:18:15,959
Oh, that reminds me,
I had that dream again.

347
00:18:16,126 --> 00:18:18,420
But this time,
I saw the hunter's face.

348
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:20,922
- Really?
- Yeah.

349
00:18:21,131 --> 00:18:23,091
- You'll never guess who it was.
- Who?

350
00:18:23,299 --> 00:18:25,802
- No, no.
- Is something wrong?

351
00:18:25,969 --> 00:18:28,555
No, it's just that I'd rather not
discuss the dream right now.

352
00:18:28,763 --> 00:18:30,265
Oh, you're right. I'm sorry.

353
00:18:30,431 --> 00:18:33,017
Like you even care
who the hunter is right now.

354
00:18:33,184 --> 00:18:37,480
Yes, there are so many other things
I'm more interested in.

355
00:18:38,481 --> 00:18:41,150
- Yeah, that's better, isn't it?
- Yeah.

356
00:18:41,526 --> 00:18:43,569
Do you feel relaxed?

357
00:18:44,988 --> 00:18:47,907
- Was it your sister?
- What?

358
00:18:48,074 --> 00:18:50,201
The hunter.
It was your sister, wasn't it?

359
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:52,412
No. I thought
you didn't wanna talk about this.

360
00:18:52,578 --> 00:18:55,998
Oh, God, you're right, you're right.
I don't. I really... I really don't.

361
00:18:56,165 --> 00:18:59,377
I'd much rather be exploring
other things right now,

362
00:18:59,585 --> 00:19:04,215
like your lips and your chin

363
00:19:04,465 --> 00:19:08,636
- and your neck.
- Oh, keep going.

364
00:19:09,428 --> 00:19:12,014
Oh, for God's sake, who was it?

365
00:19:12,807 --> 00:19:15,476
- What is with you?
- I just have to know!

366
00:19:15,685 --> 00:19:21,315
- Okay. It was me.
- Of course it was!

367
00:19:22,525 --> 00:19:25,528
The hunter represents your feelings
of anger and abandonment

368
00:19:25,695 --> 00:19:28,239
that you've been running
from ever since your parents' divorce.

369
00:19:28,406 --> 00:19:30,741
Until now, you've been able
to avoid those painful arrows,

370
00:19:30,908 --> 00:19:33,619
sometimes seeking refuge
in the forest of repression.

371
00:19:33,828 --> 00:19:37,873
Now, your willingness to identify the
hunter signals that you are now ready

372
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:42,127
to reintegrate these complex emotions
into a more cohesive self!

373
00:19:42,336 --> 00:19:46,006
Wow! It's all so clear now.

374
00:19:46,215 --> 00:19:49,510
It certainly is!

375
00:19:49,885 --> 00:19:51,262
That was amazing.

376
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:53,555
I'm so glad I gave you
a second chance.

377
00:19:53,764 --> 00:19:56,100
- Oh, Marie, l...
- Please don't apologise.

378
00:19:56,934 --> 00:19:59,478
Maybe someday it'll be some
funny story we tell our grandkids,

379
00:19:59,645 --> 00:20:02,606
the time Grandpa broke up
with Grandma.

380
00:20:03,982 --> 00:20:08,445
- Actually, Grandma...
- Yes?

381
00:20:08,654 --> 00:20:12,074
I'm afraid this isn't gonna work.

382
00:20:12,866 --> 00:20:14,451
What?

383
00:20:15,452 --> 00:20:18,080
- Us. I'm afraid that...
- Wait a minute.

384
00:20:18,288 --> 00:20:21,708
Am I crazy
or are you breaking up with me again?

385
00:20:21,917 --> 00:20:24,002
Well, they're not completely
unrelated.

386
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:32,678
You see,
you are a beautiful young woman

387
00:20:32,844 --> 00:20:35,514
and I have really enjoyed tackling
some of these issues with you.

388
00:20:35,681 --> 00:20:38,266
It's that I don't think
that's the basis for a relationship.

389
00:20:38,475 --> 00:20:40,560
You deserve someone
who appreciates all you offer.

390
00:20:40,769 --> 00:20:41,812
I don't believe this.

391
00:20:41,978 --> 00:20:44,064
I feel more like your therapist
than your boyfriend.

392
00:20:44,231 --> 00:20:46,775
But I thought we were having
such a good time together.

393
00:20:48,777 --> 00:20:51,113
I'm afraid our time is up.

394
00:20:56,493 --> 00:20:59,371
This weekend's game?
Well, yeah, I want them, Duke.

395
00:20:59,538 --> 00:21:03,041
Seahawks-Chiefs, are you kidding?
I'll pick them up tomorrow.

396
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:06,127
Hey, wouldn't it be a kick
if we wound up in-laws?

397
00:21:06,294 --> 00:21:08,338
- Go to hell!
- Oh, hold on a sec.

398
00:21:08,505 --> 00:21:12,008
Good, embrace the anger.
It's the best way to mental health.

399
00:21:12,175 --> 00:21:15,970
I don't need health tips
from you, you quack!

400
00:21:16,179 --> 00:21:18,139
You made progress
in the time we've been together.

401
00:21:18,348 --> 00:21:21,101
Oh, don't flatter yourself!

402
00:21:22,602 --> 00:21:25,355
- I have the name of a specialist.
- Call him yourself!

403
00:21:26,564 --> 00:21:29,108
Hey, Duke, I'm gonna be kind
of busy tomorrow.

404
00:21:29,275 --> 00:21:31,361
Maybe you could just drop
those tickets in the mail

405
00:21:31,528 --> 00:21:33,488
right now, so you don't forget.
