1
00:00:08,634 --> 00:00:12,930
Thank you very much.
Well, Roz... Oh, baby pictures?

2
00:00:13,097 --> 00:00:14,807
Actually, these aren't
the most flattering.

3
00:00:14,974 --> 00:00:18,602
Oh, nonsense, Baby Alice
couldn't possibly take a bad picture.

4
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:20,312
Oh, well, that's just adorable,

5
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:23,399
the silly little one with the jam
all over her face.

6
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:26,819
Well, actually, that's not jam, Frasier,
it's baby eczema.

7
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:29,864
Oh, well, there's no need
to worry about that.

8
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,741
That sort of thing
is bound to clear up.

9
00:00:33,075 --> 00:00:36,579
- Or spread.
- Just give them back.

10
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:37,788
Oh, hello, all.

11
00:00:37,955 --> 00:00:40,499
- Oh, Niles.
- Baby pictures.

12
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:42,418
I don't really want anyone
to look at those.

13
00:00:42,585 --> 00:00:44,378
Well, I don't know why not.

14
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:47,423
Botticelli himself couldn't have painted
a more perfect angel.

15
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:50,968
Well, thank you, Niles.
She is precious, isn't she?

16
00:00:52,428 --> 00:00:53,762
<i>I know.</i>

17
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:56,473
Anyway, Niles, how did things go
with Maris' lawyers?

18
00:00:56,682 --> 00:00:58,225
Cappuccino, please.

19
00:00:58,392 --> 00:01:00,519
Maris is determined
to prolong my suffering.

20
00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:04,148
She's asked to postpone our court date
another eight months.

21
00:01:04,356 --> 00:01:05,858
- Eight months?
- Yes.

22
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:09,069
Last night, I was in such a state,
I wished I had a piano to crawl under.

23
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:11,029
What?

24
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:13,907
It's a habit I developed as a child
to combat anxiety.

25
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:16,785
There's something about the safe,
dark, protected environment.

26
00:01:16,952 --> 00:01:18,412
- It seemed comforting to me.
- Yes.

27
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:22,791
The week before his first Little League
tryout, he practically lived under there.

28
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,252
Well, we all did weird stuff
when we were kids.

29
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:28,672
<i>I know.</i>

30
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:32,467
So, Niles, how did your lawyers
respond to this postponement request?

31
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:34,845
Well, I can tell you
they weren't very happy about it.

32
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:36,721
They got on the phone,
raised some hell

33
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:40,725
and got that postponement cut down
to seven months.

34
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:43,854
Niles, are you serious?
You think maybe it's time

35
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,147
that you consider getting
some new lawyers?

36
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:48,775
Fire Harrison and Reid?
They're the top firm in Seattle.

37
00:01:48,984 --> 00:01:51,695
But they're bleeding you dry.
They don't mind these postponements.

38
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:54,239
The longer they draw this out,
the more money they'll get.

39
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:56,700
Oh, you know, I have
the perfect person for you to call.

40
00:01:56,866 --> 00:01:59,953
My old boyfriend, Donny.
He's a great lawyer.

41
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:01,913
No offence, Roz, but I highly doubt

42
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,833
that your Donny is in the same league
with Harrison and Reid.

43
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,669
Don't be so sure.
I mean, he's smart, he's tough.

44
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:11,631
He doesn't take no for an answer,
not that I ever tested that theory.

45
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,925
Wait a minute,
are we talking about Donny Douglas?

46
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:15,510
- Yes.
- Oh, my God.

47
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:18,471
Niles, I've read about this guy.
He's the one they call The Piranha.

48
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:21,182
Yeah, but that's because
he has this night-grinding problem

49
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:24,352
that makes his teeth really sharp
and tiny.

50
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:28,898
Yes, well, anyway, Niles, I mean,
this guy just won a huge case.

51
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:30,942
I mean, he might be
just who you need.

52
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:32,193
I appreciate your concern,

53
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,822
but, really, my situation is not as dire
as you're making it out to be.

54
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:38,449
- What's that smell?
- What smell?

55
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,159
The one coming out
of your briefcase.

56
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:42,078
Oh, I don't smell anything.

57
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:46,582
Oh, my God, is this your lunch?

58
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:49,001
A bologna sandwich?

59
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:55,216
And a fruit cocktail?

60
00:02:55,424 --> 00:03:00,012
Oh, Niles, do you see what
these lawyers have reduced you to?

61
00:03:00,179 --> 00:03:02,223
Do you have any idea
what they're having for lunch?

62
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:05,142
I don't know. They don't itemise,
they just bill me for the total.

63
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:15,778
Donny should be here any minute.
Make yourselves comfortable.

64
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:18,406
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

65
00:03:19,323 --> 00:03:20,908
Frasier, you really don't have to stay.

66
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:24,578
Well, I didn't have to come at all,
but if I hadn't, you never would have.

67
00:03:24,745 --> 00:03:26,622
Well, the office seems nice enough.

68
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:28,666
Might have overdone it
on the plants a little.

69
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:33,420
Yes, it's excess like this
that's destroying the plastic rain forest.

70
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:35,714
Niles.

71
00:03:37,299 --> 00:03:39,969
University of Las Vegas.

72
00:03:42,054 --> 00:03:45,307
No problem finding tassels
for those mortarboards.

73
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:51,271
Will you stop being such a snob?

74
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,399
Give this man a chance,
for God's sake.

75
00:03:53,565 --> 00:03:55,401
And, please, will you have a mint?

76
00:03:55,567 --> 00:03:58,612
I'm halfway across the room,
all I can smell is bologna.

77
00:04:00,447 --> 00:04:02,157
Hey. How you doing?
Donny Douglas.

78
00:04:02,324 --> 00:04:04,701
- How are you? Who's who?
- Mr. Douglas, I'm Frasier Crane.

79
00:04:04,868 --> 00:04:06,161
- This is Niles.
- You're Niles.

80
00:04:06,328 --> 00:04:07,371
- Frasier Crane?
- Yes.

81
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:09,373
- You're Roz's buddy, aren't you?
- Yes, yes.

82
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,542
You gotta do me a favour, okay?
Tell Roz,

83
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:14,628
finally, I had my teeth capped.
See? Look.

84
00:04:14,795 --> 00:04:17,506
- Oh, yes. Well, I'll tell her.
- You promise you won't forget?

85
00:04:17,673 --> 00:04:19,675
- Oh, not much danger of that.
- Okay.

86
00:04:19,841 --> 00:04:21,927
Now, I gotta be in court
in about 20 minutes,

87
00:04:22,094 --> 00:04:23,929
so sit down, let's get started.

88
00:04:24,096 --> 00:04:25,639
Well, as we discussed
on the phone...

89
00:04:25,806 --> 00:04:30,352
Maria, get me my grey suit for court.
Come on, come on, come on.

90
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,356
Maris is determined to exhaust my
already strained financial resources.

91
00:04:34,564 --> 00:04:35,941
- And the real injustice...
- Yeah.

92
00:04:36,149 --> 00:04:38,944
And, Maria, could you just cancel
that 4:00 of mine?

93
00:04:39,111 --> 00:04:42,739
And would you also put Joe Silva
on my call sheet?

94
00:04:42,948 --> 00:04:44,491
I'm listening, I'm listening. Come on.

95
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:46,535
Well, Maris has no right
to be angry with me.

96
00:04:46,701 --> 00:04:48,912
Maria, you're the best.
Thank you so much. Cool.

97
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:51,915
What? What? Come on, let's go.
What?

98
00:04:52,082 --> 00:04:54,709
- I'm sorry, I forgot what I was saying.
- Oh, don't worry.

99
00:04:54,876 --> 00:04:56,920
Maria has that effect on men
all the time.

100
00:04:59,756 --> 00:05:03,760
Niles, I think you were about to tell
Mr. Douglas about Dr. Schenkman.

101
00:05:03,969 --> 00:05:06,388
Right. Well, last year,

102
00:05:06,554 --> 00:05:09,057
Maris and I were actually
making progress in couples therapy,

103
00:05:09,224 --> 00:05:12,602
when, to my dismay, I discovered
that she and our therapist were...

104
00:05:12,811 --> 00:05:14,479
- Oh, my God.
- That's right, they were...

105
00:05:14,646 --> 00:05:17,107
This is the best corned beef
I have ever tasted.

106
00:05:18,024 --> 00:05:20,318
You've gotta have a bite of this.
Here.

107
00:05:20,485 --> 00:05:22,946
- Come on, it's got spicy mustard.
- No, thanks.

108
00:05:23,154 --> 00:05:26,741
- How about you?
- Sorry, mustard allergy.

109
00:05:28,535 --> 00:05:31,412
Mr. Douglas, maybe we'll come back
when you have more time.

110
00:05:31,579 --> 00:05:35,250
No, no, no. I got the gist.
Your wife was doing your shrink.

111
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:37,919
Now she's trying to bleed you
with a long pre-trial, I get it.

112
00:05:38,086 --> 00:05:39,963
- Who's her lawyer?
- Lockhart and Whalen.

113
00:05:40,129 --> 00:05:44,759
- Maria, get me Lockhart. Or Whalen.
- Wait, wait, wait, you're calling them?

114
00:05:44,926 --> 00:05:47,929
Yeah, listen, could we just
cut through the formalities here?

115
00:05:48,429 --> 00:05:49,472
Okay.

116
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:52,517
Niles, what you need
is a guy like me representing you.

117
00:05:52,725 --> 00:05:54,769
What you're in here is a street fight,

118
00:05:54,977 --> 00:05:57,063
and you gotta know
who's covering your back.

119
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:59,607
So, what I guarantee you is this:

120
00:06:00,149 --> 00:06:04,028
You will never see me unprepared,

121
00:06:04,195 --> 00:06:07,198
you'll never see me intimidated,

122
00:06:07,365 --> 00:06:11,953
and you will never,
ever see me throw in the towel.

123
00:06:12,119 --> 00:06:15,248
- Understand?
- I'd certainly hope not.

124
00:06:16,499 --> 00:06:19,835
- I've got Geoff Whalen on line one.
- Okay, thank you.

125
00:06:20,044 --> 00:06:21,545
- May I have a word with you?
- Yes.

126
00:06:21,754 --> 00:06:25,341
Whalen, Donny Douglas here.
I'm calling about Niles Crane. Yeah.

127
00:06:25,508 --> 00:06:28,469
I can't possibly let this man
represent me. I'll be humiliated.

128
00:06:28,677 --> 00:06:30,346
Niles, you have got to hear
this man out.

129
00:06:30,513 --> 00:06:32,765
I'm sorry, this is exactly
what you want in a lawyer,

130
00:06:32,932 --> 00:06:34,475
someone who's not afraid
to show moxie.

131
00:06:34,642 --> 00:06:36,644
He's an inch away
from showing us the full moxie.

132
00:06:36,811 --> 00:06:40,189
You're gonna get hit with a countersuit
for an infliction of pain and distress.

133
00:06:40,356 --> 00:06:41,398
You don't think I can win?

134
00:06:41,565 --> 00:06:44,235
You call York and McFadden, you see
what those bastards had to pay

135
00:06:44,401 --> 00:06:46,654
for trying to pull this same crap
on a client of mine.

136
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,781
Yeah, we're talking big numbers here,
Whalen.

137
00:06:48,989 --> 00:06:50,532
You haven't seen
so many zeros lined up

138
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:53,619
since Mr. Spock had a book signing.
Yeah.

139
00:06:55,371 --> 00:06:57,081
You gotta hear this.
Come here, come here.

140
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:01,377
<i>Well, yes, of course,
it's important to be reasonable.</i>

141
00:07:01,543 --> 00:07:03,337
<i>I'm sure we can
move a few things around</i>

142
00:07:03,504 --> 00:07:05,214
<i>and be ready for court
by about next month.</i>

143
00:07:06,173 --> 00:07:07,383
<i>- Mr. Douglas?
- Yeah?</i>

144
00:07:07,549 --> 00:07:11,136
<i>Does this mean you're now
representing Niles Crane?</i>

145
00:07:12,805 --> 00:07:14,807
That's exactly what that means.

146
00:07:14,973 --> 00:07:17,768
And, Whalen, I'll be in touch
about a discovery schedule.

147
00:07:17,935 --> 00:07:20,103
Have a nice day.

148
00:07:20,604 --> 00:07:22,648
- Mr. Douglas, that was brilliant.
- Yes.

149
00:07:22,814 --> 00:07:26,109
My goodness, almost makes me wish
I was still married to Lilith.

150
00:07:27,236 --> 00:07:30,238
Now, we're probably gonna get rolling
sometime this week with depositions.

151
00:07:30,405 --> 00:07:33,325
So, you know, pick a day,
we'll get together, I will prepare you,

152
00:07:33,492 --> 00:07:36,161
but it's gonna be very low-key, casual,
over dinner or something.

153
00:07:36,328 --> 00:07:38,205
- You're due in court in ten minutes.
- Okay.

154
00:07:38,372 --> 00:07:39,414
- And, Donny?
- Yeah?

155
00:07:39,581 --> 00:07:41,541
Mustard.

156
00:07:43,293 --> 00:07:44,836
Jeez, was that there
the whole time?

157
00:07:46,254 --> 00:07:48,298
That's so embarrassing.

158
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:59,601
And, indeed, I had high hopes
for Niles and Maris,

159
00:07:59,809 --> 00:08:02,729
as is witnessed
by my wedding toast,

160
00:08:02,938 --> 00:08:04,731
in which I combined
my heartfelt sentiments

161
00:08:04,898 --> 00:08:06,691
with apt quotations
from Shakespeare,

162
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:11,029
jazz great Louis Armstrong
and the poet Catullus.

163
00:08:11,655 --> 00:08:15,200
And so your answer would be,
"Yes, I attended their wedding"?

164
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:20,163
Once again, Frasier, could you try
to keep your answers brief?

165
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:23,041
- Well, l...
- Trust me, he did.

166
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,669
All right, all right, look,
I'll try to do better.

167
00:08:26,836 --> 00:08:29,547
I still don't understand why
they're deposing Frasier before Niles.

168
00:08:29,714 --> 00:08:31,591
They like to question friends
and family first

169
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,094
so they get as much information as
they can to try to catch Niles in a lie.

170
00:08:35,428 --> 00:08:37,680
They're also gonna allege that
during the separation,

171
00:08:37,889 --> 00:08:39,224
Niles was wasteful with money.

172
00:08:40,308 --> 00:08:42,310
She's calling me wasteful?

173
00:08:42,518 --> 00:08:45,229
Do you recall what she used to do
when our dogs needed a shampoo?

174
00:08:45,396 --> 00:08:47,815
Yes, she'd fill the bathtub
with Evian.

175
00:08:48,024 --> 00:08:50,151
Half the time,
she'd just get a new dog.

176
00:08:52,862 --> 00:08:53,946
Anyway, look, Frasier,

177
00:08:54,113 --> 00:08:56,616
they might ask you
if you witnessed any examples

178
00:08:56,783 --> 00:09:01,079
of Niles throwing money around.
And your answer would be?

179
00:09:03,247 --> 00:09:06,209
- Yes.
- No, no, no.

180
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:09,295
The answer is,
"Not to the best of my recollection."

181
00:09:09,504 --> 00:09:14,091
- But I do recall, and I'll be under oath.
- Oh, please, not this again.

182
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,929
As you figured out,
Frasier is a bit of a stickler

183
00:09:18,095 --> 00:09:20,264
when it comes to his ethics,
and I applaud him for it.

184
00:09:20,431 --> 00:09:22,266
- Oh, great.
- More coffee, anyone?

185
00:09:22,433 --> 00:09:24,935
No, thank you, Daphne.
I think I'm just about done here.

186
00:09:25,102 --> 00:09:27,313
In fact, I've got a conference call
back at the office.

187
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,482
I'm gonna check
to see if that's still happening.

188
00:09:29,649 --> 00:09:32,026
Why don't you see if there's questions
we haven't done yet?

189
00:09:32,193 --> 00:09:34,653
- All right?
- Oh, all right, all right.

190
00:09:34,862 --> 00:09:37,907
No, we've done those, all right.
Oh, here's one:

191
00:09:38,115 --> 00:09:42,787
"Can you recall a specific incident
where Maris lost her temper

192
00:09:42,953 --> 00:09:47,625
or behaved in a way you'd characterise
as volatile or unstable?"

193
00:09:52,546 --> 00:09:54,215
You're kidding.

194
00:09:54,381 --> 00:09:57,468
No... Well, based on what?
Oh, please.

195
00:09:57,676 --> 00:09:59,053
- Something wrong?
- No, it's okay.

196
00:09:59,219 --> 00:10:02,181
No, thank you, thank you, Maria, no.
Maris' lawyers, they kill me.

197
00:10:02,348 --> 00:10:04,683
All week long, it's been
one desperate ploy after another.

198
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:06,685
- This is the best one yet.
- What is it?

199
00:10:06,852 --> 00:10:08,896
Oh, now they're claiming
alienation of affection.

200
00:10:09,063 --> 00:10:10,773
You're kidding me.
After what she did?

201
00:10:10,939 --> 00:10:12,691
Now they're saying that
during the marriage,

202
00:10:12,858 --> 00:10:14,359
Niles was in love
with another woman.

203
00:10:14,526 --> 00:10:16,945
- Who?
- Oh, you.

204
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:21,909
- Me?
- Dear God.

205
00:10:22,117 --> 00:10:25,245
That's absurd. Have you ever heard
anything so ridiculous?

206
00:10:25,412 --> 00:10:27,331
Well...

207
00:10:27,497 --> 00:10:30,125
Not to the best of my recollection.

208
00:10:35,881 --> 00:10:38,342
Why on earth would they think
Dr. Crane's in love with me?

209
00:10:38,508 --> 00:10:40,052
Oh, something about
a country-club ball

210
00:10:40,218 --> 00:10:42,012
the two of you attended
a few years back.

211
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,889
- This is all based on that?
- Yeah.

212
00:10:44,056 --> 00:10:46,683
You caused quite a stir
on the dance floor or something.

213
00:10:46,892 --> 00:10:49,352
Yeah, we were just putting on a show
for his snobby friends.

214
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:50,729
You must have been convincing,

215
00:10:50,896 --> 00:10:53,231
because they're gonna subpoena you
for deposition.

216
00:10:53,398 --> 00:10:56,485
We can call their bluff right away,
you can come tomorrow with Frasier.

217
00:10:56,693 --> 00:10:57,861
- Fine by me.
- Okay, great.

218
00:10:58,028 --> 00:11:00,530
Now, I'm gonna have to prepare you
for this because lawyers,

219
00:11:00,697 --> 00:11:03,200
they can twist your words around.
They get a judge to buy it,

220
00:11:03,366 --> 00:11:05,994
because of the prenup,
Maris can really stick it to Niles.

221
00:11:06,161 --> 00:11:08,830
- But I got this conference call...
- Well, I could come with you.

222
00:11:08,997 --> 00:11:11,374
- We'll get it done in an hour.
- Just let me grab me coat.

223
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:13,293
Don't you worry, Dr. Crane.

224
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:15,128
Now, Frasier, I hope you realise

225
00:11:15,629 --> 00:11:17,589
they're gonna ask you
about this business too.

226
00:11:17,797 --> 00:11:19,549
- Me?
- Yes, but don't worry.

227
00:11:19,716 --> 00:11:22,093
This is one time
when your compulsive truth-telling

228
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,262
won't get us into any trouble.

229
00:11:24,429 --> 00:11:26,973
- Bye.
- Bye.

230
00:11:27,724 --> 00:11:31,686
Well, that's it. It's over.
It's over, and I've lost.

231
00:11:31,853 --> 00:11:34,397
- Maris has won. Maris always wins.
- Niles.

232
00:11:34,564 --> 00:11:36,149
Niles never wins.

233
00:11:37,108 --> 00:11:40,028
Niles always loses. That's why
Niles lives at the Shangri-la

234
00:11:40,195 --> 00:11:42,155
and drives a hatchback.

235
00:11:42,322 --> 00:11:45,200
Niles, now, get a grip.
Maris' people are just fishing.

236
00:11:45,366 --> 00:11:47,577
We're the only ones who know
how you feel about Daphne.

237
00:11:47,785 --> 00:11:51,122
Today. Tomorrow, everyone will know,
including Daphne.

238
00:11:51,331 --> 00:11:52,665
This is how she's gonna find out.

239
00:11:52,874 --> 00:11:55,335
I wanted to whisper it to her
over a candlelight dinner,

240
00:11:55,501 --> 00:11:58,046
not have it read back to her
by a court stenographer.

241
00:11:58,254 --> 00:12:00,465
What are you talking about?
Frasier's not gonna tell.

242
00:12:00,631 --> 00:12:02,341
He'll be under oath.
What if they ask him?

243
00:12:02,508 --> 00:12:05,219
Well, he'll just say no. Right, Fras?

244
00:12:10,641 --> 00:12:14,145
- Fras?
- Well, it's not that simple.

245
00:12:14,353 --> 00:12:16,063
You heard what he said,
I'll be under oath.

246
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:18,774
Oh, my God, I can't breathe.

247
00:12:19,025 --> 00:12:20,526
I can't breathe.

248
00:12:20,693 --> 00:12:22,361
Niles. Here.

249
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:25,448
Put your head between your legs.
I'll get you some water.

250
00:12:25,615 --> 00:12:27,867
You'll be all right.
Just take a couple of deep breaths.

251
00:12:28,034 --> 00:12:32,371
If I could take deep breaths,
it would mean I could breathe.

252
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,623
You're not gonna go
and blow this for him, are you?

253
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:37,126
There's nothing I'd like to do more
than help my brother.

254
00:12:37,293 --> 00:12:39,378
I'd like to do it
without violating my ethics.

255
00:12:39,545 --> 00:12:41,297
But Maris is responsible
for this divorce.

256
00:12:41,464 --> 00:12:43,632
Niles' feelings for Daphne
has nothing to do with it.

257
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:46,343
Now, if you cover for Niles,
you won't be doing anything wrong.

258
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:49,763
Dad, we are talking about perjury.
When is that ever acceptable?

259
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:52,600
Oh, you want an example? Fine.

260
00:12:52,766 --> 00:12:55,728
Let's say, what if there was a comet
hurtling towards the Earth.

261
00:12:55,936 --> 00:12:56,979
For God's sake.

262
00:12:57,146 --> 00:12:59,356
You could save Earth,
but the only way you could do it

263
00:12:59,523 --> 00:13:02,026
is by lying under oath.
Would you do it then?

264
00:13:03,903 --> 00:13:07,031
- Who am I lying to, the comet?
- Oh, just answer the question.

265
00:13:07,239 --> 00:13:09,491
All right, I suppose
that in certain extreme cases...

266
00:13:09,658 --> 00:13:11,201
So then you'd lie?

267
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:14,663
To save mankind
from a talking comet, yes.

268
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:15,998
But you won't lie for Niles?

269
00:13:16,165 --> 00:13:18,083
You make me sound
like some insensitive lout

270
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:20,377
who isn't aware
that my brother's out there in pain.

271
00:13:20,586 --> 00:13:22,296
Isn't that Niles' water?

272
00:13:22,504 --> 00:13:24,339
I'm just checking to see
it's not too cold.

273
00:13:26,592 --> 00:13:28,135
Niles?

274
00:13:28,302 --> 00:13:31,138
- Niles?
- I'm over here.

275
00:13:32,764 --> 00:13:34,766
The piano. Niles.

276
00:13:34,933 --> 00:13:36,810
Please, please,
just come out from under there.

277
00:13:36,977 --> 00:13:39,062
- Things are not that bad.
- Not that bad?

278
00:13:39,271 --> 00:13:41,064
Daphne is going to find out
about this.

279
00:13:41,273 --> 00:13:43,984
Not if you crawl out
before she gets home.

280
00:13:44,568 --> 00:13:47,237
Niles, please, come out here.
Now, come on.

281
00:13:47,404 --> 00:13:49,614
Why should I?
There's nothing for me out there.

282
00:13:49,781 --> 00:13:53,577
It's all lawyers and ex-wives
and broken hearts.

283
00:13:53,994 --> 00:13:57,581
All I have to contend with under here
is a couple of dust bunnies.

284
00:13:57,789 --> 00:14:00,125
A few cobwebs.

285
00:14:00,292 --> 00:14:02,627
Some kind of a nest.

286
00:14:03,295 --> 00:14:06,923
Dear God, doesn't your vacuum
come with any attachments?

287
00:14:07,132 --> 00:14:09,384
All right, just sit tight
and I'll get you a wet cloth.

288
00:14:09,551 --> 00:14:11,428
Look what you've done.
I hope you're happy now.

289
00:14:11,595 --> 00:14:13,680
Do you really wanna see me
lying under oath?

290
00:14:13,847 --> 00:14:16,182
It's better than seeing your brother
lying under a piano.

291
00:14:16,349 --> 00:14:18,226
I can't believe you're being casual
about this.

292
00:14:18,393 --> 00:14:20,770
Do you realise you're asking me
to do something unethical?

293
00:14:20,979 --> 00:14:22,647
For God's sake,
nobody's even gonna know.

294
00:14:22,814 --> 00:14:24,149
Yes, but that's the point.

295
00:14:24,316 --> 00:14:26,318
Ethics are what we do
when no one else is looking.

296
00:14:26,484 --> 00:14:28,361
For heaven's sake,
I learned that from you.

297
00:14:28,528 --> 00:14:30,572
Are you saying you wouldn't
have trouble with this?

298
00:14:30,739 --> 00:14:32,157
- Niles, here.
- Thank you.

299
00:14:32,323 --> 00:14:34,117
Let me tell you something.

300
00:14:34,284 --> 00:14:37,162
One time, when I was on the force,
I saw a guy shoot somebody.

301
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:39,539
When we caught him,
I started to read him his rights,

302
00:14:39,706 --> 00:14:42,542
but he slipped out of his cuffs
and swung at me, so I didn't finish.

303
00:14:42,709 --> 00:14:44,294
Two months later, I'm on the stand

304
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:46,838
and his lawyer asks me
if I read him his rights in full.

305
00:14:47,005 --> 00:14:48,673
Now, if I say no, this guy walks.

306
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:51,384
And this guy's been in and out of jail
all his life.

307
00:14:51,551 --> 00:14:53,386
He could have read me his rights.
So I say:

308
00:14:53,553 --> 00:14:57,515
"Yes, I did, I read them in full."
I lied under oath.

309
00:14:57,682 --> 00:14:59,726
Now, you might think
that I did an unethical thing,

310
00:14:59,892 --> 00:15:03,813
but there's not a doubt in my mind
that I did the right thing.

311
00:15:08,151 --> 00:15:10,278
Well, Dad, I'm still not sure
what I'm gonna do.

312
00:15:10,486 --> 00:15:12,488
Why do you have to make everything
so complicated?

313
00:15:12,655 --> 00:15:14,824
I don't know. But I'm never
gonna figure out anything

314
00:15:14,991 --> 00:15:16,367
with you barking in my ear.

315
00:15:16,534 --> 00:15:18,202
- Where are you going?
- To get some air.

316
00:15:18,369 --> 00:15:22,248
Oh, yeah, yeah, run away,
just like you always do.

317
00:15:22,415 --> 00:15:24,458
Boy, I sometimes don't understand
your brother.

318
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:27,837
I guess some of us can deal
with a tough situation head-on,

319
00:15:28,004 --> 00:15:31,132
and others just need an escape.

320
00:15:36,637 --> 00:15:39,432
Dr. Crane, they'll be ready for you
in just a few minutes.

321
00:15:39,598 --> 00:15:41,350
Thank you.

322
00:15:43,144 --> 00:15:47,398
- Frasier. Hi. Have you...?
- Oh, Niles. No, not yet.

323
00:15:47,565 --> 00:15:50,109
Daphne's still
in the conference room.

324
00:15:50,276 --> 00:15:52,445
The place is slithering
with Maris' lawyers.

325
00:15:52,611 --> 00:15:55,114
Oh, yes. Never a mongoose around
when you need one.

326
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:59,034
Listen, I'm sorry I ever put you
in this position.

327
00:15:59,243 --> 00:16:00,327
Niles, it's not your fault.

328
00:16:00,494 --> 00:16:02,746
No, listen, I thought a lot
about this last night,

329
00:16:02,913 --> 00:16:04,915
and I realised the way
I was carrying on yesterday

330
00:16:05,082 --> 00:16:08,419
was just making it harder for you to do
whatever you feel is the right thing.

331
00:16:08,627 --> 00:16:10,629
I'm still not really sure
what the right thing is.

332
00:16:10,796 --> 00:16:12,506
Well, if it makes any difference,

333
00:16:12,673 --> 00:16:15,092
I've decided to tell Donny
everything about Daphne.

334
00:16:15,301 --> 00:16:16,427
- Really?
- Yes.

335
00:16:16,635 --> 00:16:19,263
- He can proceed however he sees fit.
- But why, Niles?

336
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:21,306
Well, I started to wonder,

337
00:16:21,473 --> 00:16:25,227
maybe my feelings for Daphne
did affect my marriage.

338
00:16:25,394 --> 00:16:28,272
Maybe on some intuitive level,
Maris knew all along.

339
00:16:28,439 --> 00:16:30,774
I can't be certain that's not
what drove her to Schenkman.

340
00:16:30,941 --> 00:16:33,944
Listen to me. The only reason
that marriage lasted as long as it did

341
00:16:34,111 --> 00:16:36,113
was because of the effort
that you put into it,

342
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,866
from the moment you slipped
that ring onto her bony finger

343
00:16:39,032 --> 00:16:41,201
and it slipped right off again.

344
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:45,664
There is no way
that this divorce is your fault.

345
00:16:46,832 --> 00:16:49,376
- I wish I could be sure of that.
- Okay, Frasier... Oh, Niles.

346
00:16:49,543 --> 00:16:51,461
Good. Frasier,
they're just about ready for you.

347
00:16:51,628 --> 00:16:54,464
Wait for me outside the conference
room. And don't go in without me.

348
00:16:54,631 --> 00:16:56,383
I want a word
alone with your brother here.

349
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:58,385
Right.

350
00:16:58,552 --> 00:17:00,429
Wish there was something
I could do, Niles.

351
00:17:00,637 --> 00:17:03,181
Well, there is.
When you go home this afternoon,

352
00:17:03,348 --> 00:17:05,600
leave a bottle of sherry
under the piano.

353
00:17:08,895 --> 00:17:11,898
Wait for me. Okay.

354
00:17:12,065 --> 00:17:14,568
Glad you're here. There's something
I wanna talk to you about.

355
00:17:14,734 --> 00:17:16,736
- Yeah, I need to talk to you too.
- No, me first.

356
00:17:16,903 --> 00:17:19,239
Now, the only way this relationship
is gonna work, Niles,

357
00:17:19,406 --> 00:17:21,241
is if we're completely honest
with each other.

358
00:17:21,449 --> 00:17:22,659
- I agree.
- I've been digging.

359
00:17:22,826 --> 00:17:24,494
I found out
you've been holding out on me.

360
00:17:24,661 --> 00:17:26,079
Yes, and I'm very sorry about that.

361
00:17:26,246 --> 00:17:28,331
You didn't tell me
where Maris' money came from.

362
00:17:28,498 --> 00:17:30,125
It's never easy...

363
00:17:31,001 --> 00:17:32,919
- Maris' money?
- Yeah.

364
00:17:33,128 --> 00:17:36,172
I mean, you told me that Maris'
family money came from timber.

365
00:17:36,381 --> 00:17:37,757
It did. It did come from timber.

366
00:17:39,134 --> 00:17:43,430
- Oh, that's what you really think.
- Well, of course, it's true.

367
00:17:43,638 --> 00:17:45,557
And that's what all of Maris' friends
think too?

368
00:17:45,723 --> 00:17:46,891
All those country-club snobs

369
00:17:47,058 --> 00:17:49,227
who would kill for a good piece of dirt
on someone?

370
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:50,520
What are you talking about?

371
00:17:50,687 --> 00:17:53,982
If her family money didn't come
from timber, where did it come from?

372
00:18:08,538 --> 00:18:10,748
Urinal cakes?

373
00:18:13,501 --> 00:18:16,671
I don't believe this.

374
00:18:16,838 --> 00:18:20,258
All these years,
the doyenne of Seattle's elite

375
00:18:20,425 --> 00:18:22,260
looking down her nose
at everyone in sight,

376
00:18:22,427 --> 00:18:24,470
she owes it all to this.

377
00:18:24,637 --> 00:18:27,807
She's managed to have her urinal cake
and eat it too.

378
00:18:29,016 --> 00:18:31,519
Yes, I think we now have
what's known in the legal profession

379
00:18:31,686 --> 00:18:33,062
as a bargaining chip.

380
00:18:33,229 --> 00:18:35,565
Are you kidding?
She'd give anything to keep this quiet.

381
00:18:35,731 --> 00:18:37,483
All right, let me go talk
to Maris' lawyers.

382
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:40,069
No, no, no, there's some news
you want to deliver yourself.

383
00:18:40,236 --> 00:18:42,780
- May I?
- Absolutely.

384
00:18:47,368 --> 00:18:49,995
Hello, Marta. Like to speak to Maris.

385
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:51,580
Oh, why not?

386
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:56,293
She's in the final level
of her guru serenity training,

387
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:59,380
the weeklong vow of silence,
day six.

388
00:18:59,588 --> 00:19:02,091
No, that's all right. She doesn't
have to come to the phone.

389
00:19:02,299 --> 00:19:07,054
Just give her this message:
I've flushed out her family secret.

390
00:19:09,014 --> 00:19:13,102
Hello, Maris.

391
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:17,523
I can't remember the last time
I felt this way.

392
00:19:17,731 --> 00:19:20,651
The air is sweeter,
colours are brighter.

393
00:19:20,818 --> 00:19:23,112
It's as if my very senses
have come alive.

394
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,739
It makes perfect sense.
You've just won your life back.

395
00:19:25,948 --> 00:19:27,783
Frasier, watch this.
Excuse me, excuse me.

396
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:31,370
Today's special blend,
Jamaican Blue Mountain.

397
00:19:31,578 --> 00:19:33,414
- Yes, it is.
- Oh, Niles, that was very good.

398
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:34,915
That's my favourite. Well done.

399
00:19:35,082 --> 00:19:37,751
The beans were gathered on
the shady side of the northern slope...

400
00:19:37,918 --> 00:19:39,586
Don't push it.

401
00:19:40,254 --> 00:19:42,923
I still can't believe this is all over.

402
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:46,051
And I never dreamed
I'd get a settlement like that.

403
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:50,347
I'll be able to get my whole life back,
my apartment, my car.

404
00:19:50,514 --> 00:19:52,266
I owe it all to one amazing man.

405
00:19:52,432 --> 00:19:55,060
Well, thank you, Niles,
but I can't take all the credit.

406
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:57,396
I know, you're thinking of Donny.

407
00:19:57,562 --> 00:19:59,606
Well, don't think
I'm not grateful for all you did.

408
00:19:59,773 --> 00:20:03,110
To tell the truth, if it hadn't been for me
badgering you to change your lawyers,

409
00:20:03,318 --> 00:20:05,821
Donny Douglas never would've
come into your life.

410
00:20:08,156 --> 00:20:11,076
Of course, we mustn't forget
Roz's part in all of this.

411
00:20:11,284 --> 00:20:13,662
Waiter. Who understands
why anything happens?

412
00:20:13,829 --> 00:20:14,871
I mean, it's remarkable

413
00:20:15,038 --> 00:20:17,958
how completely one's life can change
in an instant.

414
00:20:22,087 --> 00:20:23,838
Oh, Niles.

415
00:20:25,507 --> 00:20:26,550
Hi, you two.

416
00:20:26,716 --> 00:20:28,760
- Oh, hello.
- Oh, hi. Hi, how are you doing?

417
00:20:28,927 --> 00:20:32,389
Oh, congratulations, Dr. Crane.
I'm so happy for you.

418
00:20:32,597 --> 00:20:33,640
Thank you, Daphne.

419
00:20:33,807 --> 00:20:35,308
What are you two doing here
together?

420
00:20:35,517 --> 00:20:36,977
Oh, well, you know,
we were talking,

421
00:20:37,143 --> 00:20:40,438
we got a little hungry, and then
we drank a little bit too much wine,

422
00:20:40,605 --> 00:20:41,940
and we laughed a little too much.

423
00:20:42,107 --> 00:20:44,150
Listen to us,
we sound like an old married couple.

424
00:20:44,317 --> 00:20:47,278
I know. You know, Frasier, if you
hadn't brought Niles to the office,

425
00:20:47,445 --> 00:20:48,988
then none of this
would have happened.

426
00:20:49,155 --> 00:20:50,198
I guess I owe you one.

427
00:20:50,365 --> 00:20:54,035
Well, now, we mustn't forget
Roz's part in all of this.

428
00:20:56,663 --> 00:20:59,332
That scent is wonderful.
What is that?

429
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:03,044
Cherry bark and almonds.
