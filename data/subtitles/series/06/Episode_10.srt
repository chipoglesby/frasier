1
00:00:09,101 --> 00:00:11,603
Hey, boys, how was dinner?

2
00:00:11,812 --> 00:00:13,855
Let's say when I picked my lobster
out of the tank,

3
00:00:14,022 --> 00:00:17,567
I had no idea he was in
for a better evening than I was.

4
00:00:18,193 --> 00:00:20,403
- What happened?
- Well, it started out well enough.

5
00:00:20,612 --> 00:00:23,532
First, they seated us
at a superb table,

6
00:00:23,698 --> 00:00:25,659
certainly better
than the one next to us,

7
00:00:25,825 --> 00:00:27,160
at which, unfortunately, they sat

8
00:00:27,327 --> 00:00:29,663
- Daphne and Donny.
- Oh, jeez.

9
00:00:29,829 --> 00:00:32,582
Being very affectionate,
of course, whispering,

10
00:00:32,749 --> 00:00:34,000
laughing, holding hands.

11
00:00:34,167 --> 00:00:36,836
This in a place
where people were trying to eat.

12
00:00:37,962 --> 00:00:39,923
Well, in an attempt
to make things better,

13
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:42,467
I suggested that Niles
and I switch seats

14
00:00:42,634 --> 00:00:44,928
so that he could face the other table.

15
00:00:45,136 --> 00:00:46,846
Unfortunately, moments later,

16
00:00:47,013 --> 00:00:49,766
they seated Maris there
with her new boyfriend.

17
00:00:52,018 --> 00:00:53,686
Also being affectionate.

18
00:00:53,895 --> 00:00:56,773
Grooming each other
like spider monkeys.

19
00:00:57,982 --> 00:00:59,609
She was deliberately taunting me,

20
00:00:59,776 --> 00:01:02,445
playing the same coquettish games
we used to play in restaurants:

21
00:01:02,654 --> 00:01:06,449
Batting her eyes, then coyly hiding
behind her breadstick.

22
00:01:08,993 --> 00:01:10,244
And then to top it all off,

23
00:01:10,411 --> 00:01:12,830
the Pouilly Fuissé we ordered
was a grave disappointment.

24
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:16,125
I urged he send it back, but he wouldn't
create a scene in front of Daphne.

25
00:01:16,292 --> 00:01:17,710
Not that she would've even noticed,

26
00:01:18,002 --> 00:01:20,254
the way Donny was feeding her
forkfuls of risotto

27
00:01:20,421 --> 00:01:22,256
as if she'd lost her arms
instead of her mind.

28
00:01:22,423 --> 00:01:24,675
What is she doing with him?

29
00:01:24,884 --> 00:01:27,345
Well, some days,
it doesn't pay to get out of bed.

30
00:01:27,512 --> 00:01:29,347
The highlight of my day
is getting out of bed

31
00:01:29,514 --> 00:01:32,850
so I can slam it
back up into the wall.

32
00:01:33,059 --> 00:01:34,435
How long are you gonna stay there?

33
00:01:34,602 --> 00:01:36,437
You can afford
the Montana now, can't you?

34
00:01:36,646 --> 00:01:38,981
Yes, but thanks to Frasier,
there's a tenant living there.

35
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:41,943
May I remind you that you begged me
to find you a sublet.

36
00:01:42,818 --> 00:01:44,612
Someone austere
and dignified enough

37
00:01:44,779 --> 00:01:46,781
not to offend
your starchy neighbours.

38
00:01:46,948 --> 00:01:48,574
Frasier, I'm not trying to blame you.

39
00:01:48,741 --> 00:01:50,826
It's just my whole world
is crashing down around me.

40
00:01:50,993 --> 00:01:52,745
- I wanna go home.
- Well, I'm sorry, Niles.

41
00:01:52,912 --> 00:01:54,455
He's got two months left
on his sublet.

42
00:01:54,663 --> 00:01:56,582
Can't you give him a call
and lean on him a bit?

43
00:01:56,749 --> 00:02:00,336
Dad, the man has a lease. I can't
very well call and ask him to move out.

44
00:02:01,796 --> 00:02:03,089
- Hi, Daph.
- Evening, all.

45
00:02:03,255 --> 00:02:05,216
- How's dinner?
- It was wonderful.

46
00:02:05,382 --> 00:02:06,884
You should've come over
and joined us.

47
00:02:07,051 --> 00:02:09,220
Well, you looked like
you had enough to contend with,

48
00:02:09,386 --> 00:02:12,848
what with your table's fork shortage.

49
00:02:15,517 --> 00:02:17,311
Donny takes such good care of me.

50
00:02:17,478 --> 00:02:19,313
After you left,
I made the tiniest comment

51
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,650
about not liking the Pouilly Fuissé,
and he sent it back.

52
00:02:22,858 --> 00:02:25,110
That snooty wine steward
argued with him,

53
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:26,820
but Donny made a scene
with the owner,

54
00:02:26,987 --> 00:02:30,115
and the next thing you knew,
our entire meal was on the house.

55
00:02:30,324 --> 00:02:32,951
I've never been prouder of him.

56
00:02:34,745 --> 00:02:36,997
Frasier, I wanna go home.

57
00:02:37,581 --> 00:02:39,958
I'll call Dr. MacLowery.

58
00:02:45,923 --> 00:02:49,259
- Why, Dr. Crane, you're back.
- Yes, Mrs. Latimer.

59
00:02:49,426 --> 00:02:51,845
Fortunately, my sublet
was able to move out early.

60
00:02:52,054 --> 00:02:53,972
I trust your tour was a success?

61
00:02:54,181 --> 00:02:57,434
- A triumph.
- Good. Take care.

62
00:02:57,935 --> 00:02:59,978
Tour?

63
00:03:00,729 --> 00:03:04,316
I could hardly let these people know
where I was living.

64
00:03:04,483 --> 00:03:06,318
I told them
I was on a lecture tour of Africa

65
00:03:06,485 --> 00:03:08,403
so they wouldn't try to contact me.

66
00:03:09,363 --> 00:03:12,032
Niles, maybe he isn't here.
Maybe we should just let ourselves in.

67
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:14,242
Right. All right.

68
00:03:18,955 --> 00:03:20,665
I'm home.

69
00:03:24,127 --> 00:03:27,088
I can already feel the last four months
dropping away.

70
00:03:27,255 --> 00:03:31,092
Yes. Soon,
Africa will be just a memory.

71
00:03:34,095 --> 00:03:38,808
I just wanna close my eyes
and savour the serenity.

72
00:03:39,684 --> 00:03:41,811
What the hell is that?

73
00:03:43,229 --> 00:03:44,689
It's Dr. MacLowery.

74
00:03:47,108 --> 00:03:50,153
Doctor... Dr. MacLowery,
what are you doing?

75
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,531
That was a ball change
leading to a riff drop.

76
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,492
You gotta lick it and stick it.

77
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:59,120
- When did you take up tap dancing?
- Years ago.

78
00:03:59,329 --> 00:04:02,123
I figured if I didn't dance,
I'd go crazy.

79
00:04:07,795 --> 00:04:09,923
I'm not sure he caught it in time.

80
00:04:14,927 --> 00:04:16,429
Baseboard. Baseboard.

81
00:04:16,596 --> 00:04:18,931
Dr. MacLowery, please,
the neighbours.

82
00:04:19,098 --> 00:04:21,476
You tell me about it.
Why, those bunch of sourpusses.

83
00:04:21,642 --> 00:04:23,353
Why, all they do is complain.

84
00:04:23,561 --> 00:04:25,772
Sunshine, rain.

85
00:04:30,943 --> 00:04:31,986
Well, look who it is.

86
00:04:32,153 --> 00:04:34,113
It's the Tenants' Board
come to welcome me home.

87
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,782
Carol and Alfred Larkin,
you remember my brother, Frasier.

88
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,618
Oh, and Mr. Probst.

89
00:04:38,784 --> 00:04:40,703
See here, Crane.

90
00:04:40,912 --> 00:04:43,664
We abhor noise in this building.

91
00:04:43,873 --> 00:04:46,167
I couldn't agree more.

92
00:04:49,003 --> 00:04:50,546
And what do you call that?

93
00:04:50,755 --> 00:04:54,634
I believe that was lick it and stick it.

94
00:04:57,094 --> 00:04:58,637
This has been going on for months.

95
00:04:58,804 --> 00:05:01,348
We would have contacted you
if we'd known how to.

96
00:05:01,557 --> 00:05:03,100
I'm sorry, but Dr. MacLowery's
moving...

97
00:05:03,267 --> 00:05:05,853
Dr. Crane, I'm afraid
the board is leaning

98
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:08,522
towards rescinding your lease.

99
00:05:08,731 --> 00:05:10,816
What? Why?

100
00:05:11,025 --> 00:05:13,068
Because you're a menace, Crane.

101
00:05:14,737 --> 00:05:15,905
You always have been.

102
00:05:16,071 --> 00:05:19,116
You have something of a reputation
in this building.

103
00:05:19,283 --> 00:05:21,911
What with all the raucous parties
you've hosted.

104
00:05:22,119 --> 00:05:23,579
I'm not a well man.

105
00:05:23,787 --> 00:05:26,749
I have a serious heart problem
and I demand quiet.

106
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:28,584
- We all do.
- Mr. Probst, I assure you...

107
00:05:28,751 --> 00:05:31,086
No, we're having a board meeting
tomorrow evening

108
00:05:31,253 --> 00:05:33,255
in which we intend to discuss
your situation.

109
00:05:33,422 --> 00:05:37,259
And if I were you,
I wouldn't plan on unpacking.

110
00:05:39,511 --> 00:05:42,306
So nice seeing you again.

111
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:50,939
It was good of you to go to all this
trouble for your brother.

112
00:05:51,106 --> 00:05:52,733
Yes. Well, in a way,
I felt responsible.

113
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,318
Oh, really?
I don't know why.

114
00:05:54,526 --> 00:05:58,113
Just because you sublet my apartment
to Bojangles the Loon.

115
00:06:00,407 --> 00:06:02,075
I'll get it.

116
00:06:03,577 --> 00:06:04,786
Niles, will you relax, please?

117
00:06:04,953 --> 00:06:06,622
- Give me that.
- Oh, relax. How can I?

118
00:06:06,788 --> 00:06:09,082
In an hour, these people
could vote me out of my home.

119
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:11,793
They won't if you show them
a good time at this reception.

120
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,171
A couple of drinks, some food,
some witty conversation,

121
00:06:14,337 --> 00:06:16,131
they'll realise what an asset you are.

122
00:06:16,339 --> 00:06:18,050
- Hi, guys.
- Hey, Roz.

123
00:06:18,258 --> 00:06:20,594
Great party, Niles.

124
00:06:23,138 --> 00:06:25,182
I was surprised to get
your last-minute invitation.

125
00:06:25,348 --> 00:06:27,893
You're not trying to set me up
with anybody, are you?

126
00:06:28,059 --> 00:06:29,728
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Good.

127
00:06:29,895 --> 00:06:31,563
You're here
because the caterer cancelled.

128
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:32,772
Now, listen.

129
00:06:32,981 --> 00:06:34,900
We need you to open the wine,
cut up some limes

130
00:06:35,066 --> 00:06:36,985
and hang up this coat.

131
00:06:37,152 --> 00:06:39,321
You actually think I am
so hard up for a night out

132
00:06:39,487 --> 00:06:43,908
that I would spend the evening
pushing drinks in God's waiting room?

133
00:06:44,117 --> 00:06:46,578
- Keep your voice down.
- Roz, please.

134
00:06:46,745 --> 00:06:49,998
- You're paying for the babysitter.
- All right, done.

135
00:06:50,206 --> 00:06:52,083
- What am I, the dishwasher?
- No, Dad.

136
00:06:52,292 --> 00:06:55,378
You were invited because, well,
it just wouldn't be a party without you.

137
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:58,548
Although there may be a few women
here that are unattached,

138
00:06:58,715 --> 00:07:03,136
who might just take a shine
to an old debonair dog like yourself.

139
00:07:03,344 --> 00:07:05,597
I'm just a piece of meat
to you guys, aren't I?

140
00:07:10,226 --> 00:07:12,270
There goes that damn
loose earring again.

141
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:14,480
Thank goodness it didn't fall
into the punch bowl.

142
00:07:14,647 --> 00:07:16,232
Don't want someone
choking on it, do we?

143
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:19,736
Yes, although nothing says party
like a tracheotomy.

144
00:07:20,361 --> 00:07:23,448
You must tell us all
about your African tour, Dr. Crane.

145
00:07:23,656 --> 00:07:27,744
Yes. Do the local people
actually enjoy your lectures?

146
00:07:27,952 --> 00:07:31,581
Well, yes, quite a bit.
Except, of course, for the pygmies.

147
00:07:31,748 --> 00:07:34,500
Most of it
went right over their heads.

148
00:07:38,963 --> 00:07:40,631
I'll get it.

149
00:07:44,886 --> 00:07:46,053
The rest of the board.

150
00:07:46,262 --> 00:07:47,972
Pleased to see you. Come in.

151
00:07:48,347 --> 00:07:51,017
- Hello, good to see you.
- Yes.

152
00:07:51,183 --> 00:07:52,643
Dr. Crane?

153
00:07:52,852 --> 00:07:54,270
While you were on the subcontinent,

154
00:07:54,437 --> 00:07:57,398
did you happen to spot
any rare African waterfowl?

155
00:07:57,607 --> 00:08:00,860
Just one, but it was already spotted.

156
00:08:06,574 --> 00:08:08,367
I'll get it.

157
00:08:09,452 --> 00:08:11,620
Shoo, shoo, shoo!
For God's sake, Niles,

158
00:08:11,787 --> 00:08:13,456
will you do something
with this damn bird?

159
00:08:13,622 --> 00:08:16,083
Quiet, quiet, quiet. Here.
There you go. Over here.

160
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,461
Niles sucks.

161
00:08:22,464 --> 00:08:25,009
The boys at the Shangri-La
loved teaching her things like that.

162
00:08:25,175 --> 00:08:27,303
- It's so tiring.
- Bite me, Niles.

163
00:08:27,469 --> 00:08:28,721
Right back at you.

164
00:08:29,138 --> 00:08:31,724
Hurry with the hors d'oeuvres.
The guests are hostile toward me.

165
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:33,726
I'm not gonna win any points
by starving them.

166
00:08:33,892 --> 00:08:37,604
- Stuff it, Niles.
- Oh, don't tempt me.

167
00:08:40,232 --> 00:08:41,650
- Dr. Crane?
- Yes.

168
00:08:41,817 --> 00:08:45,612
Who is that distinguished-Iooking man
over there?

169
00:08:48,824 --> 00:08:50,200
I've been trying to catch his eye,

170
00:08:50,367 --> 00:08:52,703
but he's far too engrossed
in that gardening book.

171
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:56,248
Well, that is actually
my father, Martin. Dad?

172
00:08:59,084 --> 00:09:03,130
- Don't mind him. He's painfully shy.
- I know just how he feels.

173
00:09:03,297 --> 00:09:07,217
I'm a bit of a shrinking violet myself.
Martin.

174
00:09:08,844 --> 00:09:10,804
Do you see
that obnoxious old lecher?

175
00:09:11,013 --> 00:09:13,974
Well, you're gonna have
to be a lot more specific.

176
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,853
The one in the blue jacket.
I'm about this close to slapping him.

177
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,396
Wait, wait, that is Mr. Hawkins.

178
00:09:19,563 --> 00:09:21,398
He's the vice president
of the Tenants' Board.

179
00:09:21,565 --> 00:09:24,317
Well, I don't care who he is.
He just pinched me.

180
00:09:24,484 --> 00:09:26,903
Roz, please,
the man is 80 and arthritic.

181
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:28,488
How hard can he pinch?

182
00:09:32,701 --> 00:09:34,244
People are not talking, not mixing.

183
00:09:34,411 --> 00:09:36,580
- People are pinching.
- Stop it. Stop it.

184
00:09:36,746 --> 00:09:39,165
The party is just starting.
Everything's gonna be just fine.

185
00:09:39,332 --> 00:09:41,293
Don't you touch me.

186
00:09:43,545 --> 00:09:45,505
Daphne, how are those other...?

187
00:09:48,258 --> 00:09:49,301
Baby?

188
00:09:52,846 --> 00:09:54,180
Oh, dear God.

189
00:09:58,268 --> 00:09:59,769
This bird's dead.

190
00:09:59,978 --> 00:10:01,104
How did this happen?

191
00:10:01,312 --> 00:10:03,773
She must have eaten
some of the hors d'oeuvres.

192
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:06,192
You mean the ones
I just served to Niles' guests?

193
00:10:06,401 --> 00:10:08,027
You are very welcome.

194
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:12,240
Frasier, I am so sorry.
I completely overreacted.

195
00:10:12,448 --> 00:10:14,784
People perked up once
they saw those appetisers of yours.

196
00:10:14,951 --> 00:10:16,995
You know,
I think the Niles Crane party curse

197
00:10:17,161 --> 00:10:19,914
has finally been laid to rest.

198
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:24,836
What?

199
00:10:30,883 --> 00:10:33,011
Will somebody please tell me
what happened?

200
00:10:33,177 --> 00:10:35,513
I'm gonna let Daphne tell you.

201
00:10:39,142 --> 00:10:40,184
What is it?

202
00:10:40,351 --> 00:10:41,727
I don't mean to alarm you,

203
00:10:41,936 --> 00:10:44,105
but there's something wrong
with the hors d'oeuvre.

204
00:10:44,313 --> 00:10:47,441
- What? How do you know?
- A little bird told me.

205
00:10:51,779 --> 00:10:54,407
Sorry, sorry. I forgot the garnish.

206
00:10:54,574 --> 00:10:57,910
I'm dreadfully embarrassed about this.
Give me that. Thank you very much.

207
00:10:58,077 --> 00:11:00,955
This is the chef's prerogative.
You understand, of course.

208
00:11:01,122 --> 00:11:03,082
Roz, for God's sake.

209
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:09,296
Did you see how it happened?
Anything?

210
00:11:09,505 --> 00:11:11,048
Well, I did hear her last words,

211
00:11:11,215 --> 00:11:14,135
but I don't think
they'd be of much comfort to you.

212
00:11:15,052 --> 00:11:17,012
Oh, God, Niles, I'm so sorry.

213
00:11:17,179 --> 00:11:22,101
The mayonnaise must have gone bad.
Or the crab or the pâté.

214
00:11:22,309 --> 00:11:23,561
Which one did she eat?

215
00:11:23,769 --> 00:11:26,021
I don't know.
Daphne, smell her beak.

216
00:11:27,189 --> 00:11:29,942
All right, all right, Niles,
are you all right?

217
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:31,777
Yeah, I just need a moment.

218
00:11:31,944 --> 00:11:33,362
- Dr. Crane?
- That's long enough.

219
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:37,366
Excuse me, I'm afraid
I spilled punch on my dress.

220
00:11:37,533 --> 00:11:39,076
- I need a towel.
- No. No.

221
00:11:39,243 --> 00:11:41,453
You're much better off using that...

222
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:43,664
Yeah, this bread.

223
00:11:43,872 --> 00:11:45,666
- It's more absorbent.
- Really?

224
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:48,794
Yes, that's why they call it
nature's sponge.

225
00:11:49,002 --> 00:11:51,422
All right.

226
00:11:52,631 --> 00:11:55,300
It's working.

227
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:01,473
- All right, what do we do now?
- Daphne, you get rid of Baby.

228
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,642
I'll get rid of this tainted food.

229
00:12:03,851 --> 00:12:05,602
But we still have
a roomful of hungry guests

230
00:12:05,769 --> 00:12:07,980
with nothing to serve them.

231
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:10,607
Oh, God, would you look at that?

232
00:12:10,816 --> 00:12:12,859
She swallowed my earring.
That's what killed her.

233
00:12:13,068 --> 00:12:15,279
That means we don't have
to destroy the hors d'oeuvres.

234
00:12:15,445 --> 00:12:18,198
Frasier, Frasier, stop.
Are there any left?

235
00:12:18,824 --> 00:12:20,617
Yes, we're in luck.

236
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:24,287
This intrepid little crab puff
has survived.

237
00:12:24,454 --> 00:12:27,874
Now, all I need is a very sharp knife
and 16 toothpicks.

238
00:12:29,626 --> 00:12:32,796
Niles, I am really getting tired
of these people.

239
00:12:32,963 --> 00:12:35,882
Some lady just handed me
a piece of wet bread.

240
00:12:36,091 --> 00:12:39,845
- Oh, this party is doomed.
- No, no, Niles, listen. Don't panic.

241
00:12:40,053 --> 00:12:42,138
We've got everything we need
to make hors d'oeuvres.

242
00:12:42,305 --> 00:12:45,392
All we need is time.
You get out there and stall. All right.

243
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,602
Mrs. Latimer,
may I get you some punch?

244
00:12:47,769 --> 00:12:51,022
Well, your father went to get me some,
but that was quite a while ago.

245
00:12:51,189 --> 00:12:52,315
Please, allow me. Here.

246
00:12:52,482 --> 00:12:55,402
By the way, where is that
adorable bird of yours?

247
00:12:56,528 --> 00:12:58,405
She's resting.

248
00:12:59,072 --> 00:13:00,573
Travel really takes it out of her.

249
00:13:01,282 --> 00:13:03,618
You didn't take her to Africa, surely.

250
00:13:04,077 --> 00:13:05,328
Well, she has family there.

251
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:11,084
Mr. Probst, having a good time?

252
00:13:11,251 --> 00:13:13,086
Look here, Crane,
if you're not gonna feed us,

253
00:13:13,253 --> 00:13:14,921
we might as well
take the vote right now.

254
00:13:15,088 --> 00:13:17,257
- No, please.
- I mean, you bring the hors d'oeuvres,

255
00:13:17,423 --> 00:13:20,093
you take the hors d'oeuvres away.
What kind of a game is this?

256
00:13:20,301 --> 00:13:21,636
Well, I'm not, I'm not...

257
00:13:21,803 --> 00:13:23,096
Oh, what a good idea.

258
00:13:23,304 --> 00:13:25,640
Why don't we all play a game?
Anyone have any suggestions?

259
00:13:25,807 --> 00:13:27,058
How about Murder?

260
00:13:27,267 --> 00:13:29,978
We played it at Irene Warriner's party.
It was a hoot.

261
00:13:30,186 --> 00:13:32,230
- Oh, how do we play?
- Well, here.

262
00:13:32,397 --> 00:13:35,024
Someone tear off
a few slips of paper

263
00:13:35,233 --> 00:13:37,193
and on one of them,
write the word "murderer."

264
00:13:37,402 --> 00:13:38,444
Then we'll pass them out

265
00:13:38,611 --> 00:13:41,364
and then everyone hide
and we'll turn out the lights.

266
00:13:41,531 --> 00:13:43,741
The murderer kills someone,
they lay down on the floor,

267
00:13:43,908 --> 00:13:46,911
and then we turn on the lights and
the detective tries to solve the crime.

268
00:13:47,078 --> 00:13:50,540
I'll tell you what. I'll volunteer
to play the detective for the first round.

269
00:13:50,706 --> 00:13:52,583
Let the mayhem begin.

270
00:13:52,792 --> 00:13:56,546
Oh, Martin, there you are.
Come, hide with me.

271
00:13:56,712 --> 00:13:59,674
I know a little nook
where no one will find us.

272
00:14:01,217 --> 00:14:03,761
Oh, this game's a lot scarier
than I thought.

273
00:14:05,554 --> 00:14:10,184
All right, turn out the lights.
Everyone, hide.

274
00:14:13,604 --> 00:14:15,940
- I can't see.
- Can I help you, sir?

275
00:14:16,107 --> 00:14:18,859
I don't have my glasses. Can you
tell me what it says on this thing?

276
00:14:19,026 --> 00:14:23,197
- It says "murderer."
- Good. Then you're dead.

277
00:14:23,989 --> 00:14:27,368
This party
just gets better and better.

278
00:14:28,786 --> 00:14:30,788
- How soon?
- I'm going as fast as I can.

279
00:14:30,996 --> 00:14:32,790
First batch should be ready
in five minutes.

280
00:14:32,998 --> 00:14:35,501
All right, five minutes it is.

281
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:38,045
Ready or not, here I come.

282
00:14:38,212 --> 00:14:41,548
My goodness,
the foul fiend has struck already.

283
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:43,550
Turn the lights on.

284
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:46,720
Good heavens, he's struck twice.
That's not really in the rules, is it?

285
00:14:46,929 --> 00:14:49,181
- Frasier?
- Once dead, you can not speak.

286
00:14:49,348 --> 00:14:52,393
Take your cue from Mr. Probst.
All right, everyone.

287
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:55,187
Did any of you see
anything suspicious?

288
00:14:55,354 --> 00:14:57,856
Any odd behaviour?

289
00:14:58,065 --> 00:15:01,527
Why don't you just guess who did it
so we can get this thing over with.

290
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:03,237
Not yet.

291
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:05,572
This is very intriguing.

292
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:09,827
I think I'm going to have
to think about it for...

293
00:15:11,286 --> 00:15:13,163
...five minutes or so.

294
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:18,252
- Maybe this game was a bad idea.
- No, the fun's just starting.

295
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:20,337
I tell you what.
Let's turn out the lights again

296
00:15:20,504 --> 00:15:24,967
and we'll let our craven villain
ply his dark trade once more.

297
00:15:25,175 --> 00:15:28,679
Are you quite sure those two
didn't die of starvation?

298
00:15:28,887 --> 00:15:31,056
That's very funny.
Will you just turn out the lights?

299
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:33,767
All right, everyone, hide.

300
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:35,477
- I have a question.
- No. No talking.

301
00:15:35,644 --> 00:15:39,189
Just tell me,
can the murderer commit suicide?

302
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:41,942
Well, no, Roz. That wouldn't make
much sense, would it?

303
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:45,070
That's what I thought, but Mr. Probst
is the one who murdered me.

304
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:47,072
- Oh, was he?
- Yes.

305
00:15:47,239 --> 00:15:51,868
Well, then, Mr. Probst, I don't think
someone is playing by the rules, is he?

306
00:15:52,035 --> 00:15:54,913
You see, this way, no one else
can get murdered, can they?

307
00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:58,375
Mr. Probst?

308
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:01,753
What is it? What are you doing?

309
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,673
- Nothing, Roz, nothing.
- Are you taking his pulse?

310
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:08,176
I'm trying to. I just can't find one.

311
00:16:08,385 --> 00:16:11,638
Oh, my God. When he fell down,
I thought it was part of the game.

312
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:13,223
It didn't even look real.

313
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,849
It's time to wind the game up.

314
00:16:15,016 --> 00:16:16,935
The appetisers are ready
and they are delicious.

315
00:16:17,102 --> 00:16:20,063
I think this party
is finally back on track.

316
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:26,694
Niles, I'm afraid Mr. Probst
has passed on.

317
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:29,489
- What?
- Yes, you see,

318
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:32,700
I think that heart condition of his
finally caught up with him.

319
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:36,245
Dead? No, no, no, he's sleeping.

320
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:41,209
Old people love to nap.

321
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:44,045
Mr. Probst, time to wake up.
Mr. Probst...

322
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:46,589
Niles, Niles, he's gone.

323
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:50,885
Oh, my God, this is awful.
How could this happen?

324
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,304
Shouldn't we notify someone?

325
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:55,181
No, he was a widower.
He had no children.

326
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:58,643
He lived alone in this building
for 25 years. Oh, this is so awful.

327
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:00,561
Mr. Probst was right.
I am a menace.

328
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:03,439
- No, Niles, this is not your fault.
- But it happened at my party.

329
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:05,942
That's all they'll remember.
I may as well pack my bags.

330
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,360
There's no need for that.

331
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:09,946
We can still get him out of here
without anybody noticing.

332
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:11,781
How?

333
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:14,241
- You go find Dad.
- Why...?

334
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:16,577
Tell him to call his friend
at the police department.

335
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:19,121
One of his good friends, all right?
I'll handle the rest.

336
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:20,873
- All right.
- What's the rest?

337
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:23,876
I'm going to use the game
to distract everyone.

338
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:26,587
I will take everyone into the kitchen
for questioning,

339
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:28,881
thus drawing their attention
from the bodies.

340
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:31,175
- What do you mean bodies?
- Roz...

341
00:17:31,342 --> 00:17:32,885
- No.
- You've got to get down.

342
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:36,263
- No way in hell.
- All right, all right, how's this?

343
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:39,642
I will pay your airfare
for that vacation of yours next month.

344
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:42,645
No way. It's just too creepy.

345
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:43,854
- First class?
- Business.

346
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:46,106
- Done.
- All right, get down.

347
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,818
Lie down.

348
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:53,322
Frasier, Frasier,
I found Dad hiding from Mrs. Latimer.

349
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:55,115
- He called his friend.
- Great.

350
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:57,368
I'll start getting everyone
in the kitchen.

351
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,787
Won't they wonder why
there hasn't been another murder?

352
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:01,997
- Good point.
- Couldn't we move this along?

353
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:04,500
- Roz, quiet.
- Here. The waggon's on its way.

354
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,251
When it gets here,
let me deal with it.

355
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:09,129
- Thank you. I really appreciate this.
- Dad, we need one more favour.

356
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:10,672
You are now the killer. Come on.

357
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:13,258
You've got to murder somebody,
preferably in the kitchen.

358
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:14,510
- Oh, come on.
- Come on.

359
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:17,721
You're not gonna make somebody lie
down on this dirty floor again, are you?

360
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:20,807
There you are, Martin.
Have you been hiding from me?

361
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:24,853
Hiding? No, you're just the person
I've been looking for.

362
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:31,026
All right, turn on the lights.
Everyone... Roz, you okay?

363
00:18:31,234 --> 00:18:33,278
Yeah, it's a carnival down here.

364
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:34,821
Everyone.

365
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:39,701
There has been another murder
in the kitchen.

366
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:45,290
I am ready to solve the crime
if you will all join me

367
00:18:45,665 --> 00:18:47,167
in the kitchen.

368
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:49,002
Why can't you solve it right here?

369
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:50,879
Well, I could.
But that wouldn't be proper.

370
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:53,840
You see,
the hors d'oeuvres are in there.

371
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:56,468
Come along, all right, everyone.

372
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,386
We've got food.

373
00:18:58,595 --> 00:19:01,014
Don't touch the crime scene, please.
Thank you very much.

374
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:04,434
On your way.
Thank you very much.

375
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:06,686
Hurry, his fingers are getting stiff.

376
00:19:09,564 --> 00:19:10,649
All right, then.

377
00:19:10,857 --> 00:19:13,193
Before I determine
the identity of the killer,

378
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,154
there are a few questions
I'd like to ask each of you.

379
00:19:17,697 --> 00:19:18,948
- I'll get it.
- No.

380
00:19:19,115 --> 00:19:21,159
No one leaves
until I've solved the crime.

381
00:19:21,367 --> 00:19:23,286
Except you, Dad.

382
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:25,955
All right, then.

383
00:19:27,123 --> 00:19:29,417
I think I shall begin...

384
00:19:30,543 --> 00:19:34,088
...by drawing a diagram
of where each of you was standing

385
00:19:34,255 --> 00:19:37,258
when the first murder occurred.

386
00:19:39,719 --> 00:19:42,639
We have established that Miss Finn

387
00:19:42,847 --> 00:19:47,602
was talking with Mr. Larkin
in the upstairs hall

388
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:50,813
at 8:14.

389
00:19:51,564 --> 00:19:54,233
And he muttered something.

390
00:19:56,652 --> 00:19:58,654
Why do you keep looking out there?

391
00:19:58,821 --> 00:20:01,991
I'll ask the questions
around here, Mrs. Larkin.

392
00:20:02,617 --> 00:20:05,286
We already told you,
your father killed Mrs. Latimer.

393
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:07,872
- Mrs. Hawkins saw him.
- Mrs. Hawkins thought she saw him.

394
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:10,541
No, Martin did kill me.

395
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:13,961
And he's got a lot to learn
about playing gently.

396
00:20:17,089 --> 00:20:18,549
Mrs. Latimer,

397
00:20:19,175 --> 00:20:21,761
we have already broken
the no-eating-while-dead rule,

398
00:20:21,927 --> 00:20:24,889
but we will stand fast
on the quiet one.

399
00:20:25,723 --> 00:20:27,933
I'm bored, and I'm going home.

400
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:32,563
No, no, no, wait,
you can't blame Niles for this because

401
00:20:32,897 --> 00:20:36,108
my father is the killer.

402
00:20:36,317 --> 00:20:39,361
Yes, the case is closed.
Shall we all play another round?

403
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:42,114
God forbid. Where's Probst?

404
00:20:42,281 --> 00:20:44,325
He just left. He wasn't feeling well.

405
00:20:44,533 --> 00:20:46,702
- Yes, I hope he's all right, poor man.
- Who cares?

406
00:20:46,869 --> 00:20:49,038
I never liked the old coot anyway.

407
00:20:49,788 --> 00:20:50,831
You didn't?

408
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,834
I was planning to vote for you tonight
just to annoy him.

409
00:20:54,043 --> 00:20:56,462
- Me too.
- Well, why don't we vote right now?

410
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:59,798
Consider it done. You're in, Crane.
Welcome back.

411
00:21:00,007 --> 00:21:03,135
Carol, let's get out of here.

412
00:21:04,595 --> 00:21:07,306
Doesn't he have anything stiffer
than punch to drink?

413
00:21:07,514 --> 00:21:10,017
I don't like looking at dead bodies,
much less touching them.

414
00:21:10,184 --> 00:21:11,852
He's got a bottle of vodka
in the freezer.

415
00:21:12,019 --> 00:21:13,979
Oh, great.

416
00:21:23,739 --> 00:21:25,490
Thank you so much
for this second chance,

417
00:21:25,657 --> 00:21:27,201
and I can assure you, from now on,

418
00:21:27,409 --> 00:21:29,745
this will be the quietest apartment
in the Montana.

419
00:21:29,912 --> 00:21:31,663
Oh, my God!

420
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:33,624
Good night.
