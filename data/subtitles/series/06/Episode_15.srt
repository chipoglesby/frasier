1
00:00:08,186 --> 00:00:10,063
- Good show today, Roz.
- Yeah.

2
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:14,151
- Say, why all the catalogues?
- I need to buy a present.

3
00:00:14,317 --> 00:00:18,196
Tiffany, Cartier, Neiman Marcus...

4
00:00:18,363 --> 00:00:20,907
- Anything look good to you here?
- Well, let's see.

5
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:24,369
Who could we be shopping for?

6
00:00:24,536 --> 00:00:27,122
Perhaps a honey-voiced
radio therapist

7
00:00:27,289 --> 00:00:30,041
whose birthday's
just around the corner?

8
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:32,460
No, this present is not for you.
It's for your brother.

9
00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:34,671
Oh, all right, Roz, listen,
don't be coy.

10
00:00:34,838 --> 00:00:37,215
I think it's very smart,
your fishing for hints like this.

11
00:00:37,382 --> 00:00:39,718
You want to avoid a misstep
like you made last year.

12
00:00:39,884 --> 00:00:42,178
<i>What misstep?
You said you loved Pagliacci.</i>

13
00:00:42,387 --> 00:00:46,308
Yes, the opera, not the little
porcelain crying clown figurine.

14
00:00:46,683 --> 00:00:48,184
Look, Niles pulled some strings

15
00:00:48,351 --> 00:00:50,437
and got Alice on a list
for a really good preschool

16
00:00:50,645 --> 00:00:52,439
so I thought I'd get him
a thank-you gift.

17
00:00:52,647 --> 00:00:55,358
That's why I was asking for your
stupid opinion in the first place.

18
00:00:55,525 --> 00:00:56,943
- But forget it.
- All right, fine.

19
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:59,612
- I'll figure it out for myself.
- Have it your own way. Fine.

20
00:00:59,779 --> 00:01:02,949
But I tell you what, don't get him
a porcelain Pagliacci.

21
00:01:03,116 --> 00:01:05,577
He already has one.

22
00:01:11,708 --> 00:01:13,084
- Hi, Dad.
- Hey, Fras.

23
00:01:13,251 --> 00:01:14,627
You'll never guess who I just saw.

24
00:01:14,794 --> 00:01:16,588
I went over for a cup of coffee
with Hank.

25
00:01:16,754 --> 00:01:17,797
You remember Hank?

26
00:01:17,964 --> 00:01:20,550
He's the security guard who works
at Weston's Jewellery Store.

27
00:01:20,717 --> 00:01:22,427
Anyway, we were in his booth,

28
00:01:22,593 --> 00:01:25,430
just shooting the breeze and looking
at the surveillance monitors,

29
00:01:25,596 --> 00:01:28,933
and who do I see buying
an engagement ring but Donny.

30
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,185
As in Daphne and Donny.

31
00:01:31,394 --> 00:01:32,437
Donny?

32
00:01:32,603 --> 00:01:34,147
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

33
00:01:34,355 --> 00:01:38,985
Engagement rings is Tina's counter.
We use the zoom lens on her.

34
00:01:39,193 --> 00:01:41,612
- Dad, I'm shocked.
- Oh, no, it's just innocent fun.

35
00:01:41,779 --> 00:01:45,283
She only dresses that way because
she knows we're looking at her.

36
00:01:45,491 --> 00:01:48,369
I mean about Daphne and Donny.
I didn't realize they were this serious.

37
00:01:48,536 --> 00:01:51,414
- They spend all that time together.
- This is gonna crush Niles.

38
00:01:51,581 --> 00:01:54,041
- Yeah, I know.
- Do you think we should tell him?

39
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:56,335
No, it's none of our business.
We do not tell Niles

40
00:01:56,502 --> 00:01:58,879
and we definitely do not tell Daphne.

41
00:01:59,088 --> 00:02:01,340
- Tell Daphne what?
- Nothing.

42
00:02:01,549 --> 00:02:03,676
- It's bad news, isn't it?
- No, it's not bad news.

43
00:02:03,884 --> 00:02:06,470
Is it about my mum? Did they find
something during her physical?

44
00:02:06,637 --> 00:02:08,305
They did, didn't they?
I have to call her.

45
00:02:08,472 --> 00:02:11,517
No, Daphne, no, no, no.
There is absolutely no news.

46
00:02:11,684 --> 00:02:14,687
And even if there were,
it's not up to us to tell you about it.

47
00:02:14,895 --> 00:02:15,938
Who should tell me, then?

48
00:02:16,105 --> 00:02:17,439
Head surgeon?
Our family minister?

49
00:02:17,648 --> 00:02:18,691
- No!
- No!

50
00:02:18,858 --> 00:02:21,485
The mortician? God, I've gotta pack.
I hope I'm not too late.

51
00:02:21,652 --> 00:02:24,405
I just saw Donny
buying you an engagement ring.

52
00:02:24,613 --> 00:02:26,115
That is the news.

53
00:02:26,448 --> 00:02:27,575
Really?

54
00:02:28,284 --> 00:02:29,910
I don't believe it.

55
00:02:30,077 --> 00:02:32,788
I'm gonna get married.
God, I'm so excited.

56
00:02:32,997 --> 00:02:35,666
I'm gonna be a missus.
Mrs. Donny Douglas.

57
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:39,211
Mrs. Donald Ronald Douglas.
Oh, God!

58
00:02:40,337 --> 00:02:43,340
Yes, well, I guess we're
gonna have to prepare Niles now.

59
00:02:43,507 --> 00:02:46,552
- He's on his way over here.
- Yeah, well, don't tell him here.

60
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,179
I don't want him going to pieces
in front of Daphne.

61
00:02:49,346 --> 00:02:51,181
Yes, I guess I can tell him
at the restaurant.

62
00:02:51,348 --> 00:02:54,226
Well, just don't take him
to one of those fancy wine bistros

63
00:02:54,393 --> 00:02:55,561
that you guys love.

64
00:02:55,769 --> 00:02:59,606
News like this calls for
hard liquor in big glasses.

65
00:03:01,316 --> 00:03:03,986
Wherever it is, I just think
it's best that Niles hear it from me

66
00:03:04,194 --> 00:03:07,030
- and not from Daphne.
- Hear what from Daphne?

67
00:03:09,449 --> 00:03:10,909
I'll tell you at the restaurant.

68
00:03:11,118 --> 00:03:13,120
No, I don't wanna wait
till we get to the bistro.

69
00:03:13,287 --> 00:03:17,040
- You're just gonna have to wait.
- And you're not going to any bistro.

70
00:03:19,418 --> 00:03:22,129
Well, fine. If you won't tell me,
then I'll just ask Daphne myself.

71
00:03:22,295 --> 00:03:25,006
Niles, wait. The truth is...

72
00:03:26,716 --> 00:03:29,719
- Daphne's...
- Mother is dying.

73
00:03:32,556 --> 00:03:34,850
- Dear God.
- Yes, tragic, isn't it?

74
00:03:35,016 --> 00:03:36,142
Yes.

75
00:03:36,351 --> 00:03:38,562
She's gonna need all the support
that we can give her.

76
00:03:38,979 --> 00:03:40,021
Evening, Dr. Crane.

77
00:03:40,188 --> 00:03:42,065
Come on, Niles,
we don't wanna lose our table.

78
00:03:42,774 --> 00:03:46,778
- Did you hear the news?
- I just did. What can I say?

79
00:03:49,698 --> 00:03:52,450
I've thought about this day
ever since I was a little girl.

80
00:03:52,659 --> 00:03:53,702
I'm sure you have.

81
00:03:53,868 --> 00:03:56,996
It's even better
than I thought it would be.

82
00:03:58,289 --> 00:04:00,375
I can already picture the big day.

83
00:04:00,542 --> 00:04:03,670
Beautiful flowers everywhere,

84
00:04:03,878 --> 00:04:05,922
a sea of smiling faces.

85
00:04:06,423 --> 00:04:08,675
I suppose everyone
will want to have their picture taken

86
00:04:08,842 --> 00:04:11,094
with the lady of the hour.

87
00:04:13,763 --> 00:04:17,517
You know, maybe Daphne
could use a little quiet time.

88
00:04:17,725 --> 00:04:22,563
No, who could be quiet? I'm so happy.
Donny's gonna ask me to marry him.

89
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:25,275
- What?
- Now, come the big day,

90
00:04:25,441 --> 00:04:27,277
you'll all sit right up front
with my family

91
00:04:27,443 --> 00:04:29,696
because that's
what you are to me. Family.

92
00:04:29,904 --> 00:04:31,990
Well, that's what you are
to us too, Daph.

93
00:04:32,156 --> 00:04:34,951
Oh, I am so thrilled for you.

94
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:38,746
Oh, thank you. Thank you, all.

95
00:04:42,542 --> 00:04:43,835
I'm sorry, son.

96
00:04:46,045 --> 00:04:47,213
- You wanna talk?
- No.

97
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:49,924
Frasier, if you wouldn't mind,
I'm gonna cancel dinner.

98
00:04:50,091 --> 00:04:53,386
- I need to be alone.
- Of course, Niles.

99
00:04:53,594 --> 00:04:54,679
Look, if you need me, call.

100
00:04:58,057 --> 00:04:59,267
Poor kid.

101
00:05:00,184 --> 00:05:01,227
He'll be all right, Dad.

102
00:05:01,394 --> 00:05:05,856
You know, Niles is a lot stronger
than we give him credit for.

103
00:05:08,901 --> 00:05:10,403
Hello?

104
00:05:10,778 --> 00:05:13,280
Hold the elevator. I'll be right there.

105
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:19,161
Hang in there, son, he's on his way.

106
00:05:26,377 --> 00:05:27,419
Yes?

107
00:05:28,295 --> 00:05:32,883
This came while you were in session.
It's from a Roz Doyle.

108
00:05:33,092 --> 00:05:35,427
She wanted to thank you
for a favour that you did.

109
00:05:36,053 --> 00:05:39,848
- I'll be off now.
- All right. Good night, Mrs. Woodson.

110
00:05:44,228 --> 00:05:45,729
Come in, Mrs. Woodson.

111
00:05:46,563 --> 00:05:48,440
I'm afraid it's me, Dr. Crane.

112
00:05:49,233 --> 00:05:51,026
Daphne. What are you doing here?

113
00:05:51,193 --> 00:05:54,321
I know I should've called first,
but I need to talk to you.

114
00:05:54,488 --> 00:05:57,616
It's sort of a private matter
and I hoped we could talk here.

115
00:05:58,117 --> 00:06:01,620
Well, it's not really appropriate for me
to act as your therapist,

116
00:06:01,829 --> 00:06:03,914
but if it's just advice
from a friend that you need,

117
00:06:04,081 --> 00:06:07,626
I'm happy to lend an ear.
What's on your mind?

118
00:06:07,793 --> 00:06:09,503
Well...

119
00:06:10,295 --> 00:06:13,090
I don't think I can marry Donny.

120
00:06:13,257 --> 00:06:15,592
I think there's someone else
I'm meant to be with.

121
00:06:16,635 --> 00:06:17,719
Who is it?

122
00:06:17,928 --> 00:06:20,973
- It's Mrs...
- Oh, for God's sake, go home!

123
00:06:25,018 --> 00:06:26,311
Sorry for that interruption.

124
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:30,982
Anyway, this man
you're meant to be with, who is he?

125
00:06:31,441 --> 00:06:33,485
I'm afraid I can't say.

126
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:35,654
Yes, you can.
We're the only ones here.

127
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:37,823
Are you sure you won't laugh at me?

128
00:06:38,031 --> 00:06:39,783
How could you think
I would laugh at you?

129
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:41,284
Most people would if I told them

130
00:06:41,451 --> 00:06:43,620
I'd seen the love of my life
in a psychic vision.

131
00:06:43,828 --> 00:06:46,915
Well, most people are... What?

132
00:06:47,457 --> 00:06:50,794
You know how I have these
psychic flashes from time to time.

133
00:06:50,961 --> 00:06:53,213
Well, I had one last night.

134
00:06:53,421 --> 00:06:55,840
You had a vision about

135
00:06:56,007 --> 00:06:58,885
the love of your life. Okay.

136
00:06:59,094 --> 00:07:02,055
Well, tell me about it. Here.

137
00:07:02,222 --> 00:07:04,349
And, Daphne,

138
00:07:04,516 --> 00:07:06,726
omit nothing.

139
00:07:06,893 --> 00:07:08,395
All right.

140
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:11,981
I was straightening up the living room
when I had a sudden flash

141
00:07:12,148 --> 00:07:14,734
of a wedding ceremony
for Donny and me.

142
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:16,069
Oh, it was lovely.

143
00:07:16,277 --> 00:07:18,696
The church was packed
to the rafters.

144
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:21,574
Me mum was there
in a peach silk looking very smart,

145
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:23,243
me brothers in their suits...

146
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:25,078
I may have led you
in the wrong direction

147
00:07:25,245 --> 00:07:27,789
with the omit-nothing business.
Feel free to skip ahead.

148
00:07:27,956 --> 00:07:29,165
Right.

149
00:07:29,374 --> 00:07:32,502
Well, my father had just
walked me up to the altar

150
00:07:32,669 --> 00:07:34,921
and I was standing there
facing Donny.

151
00:07:35,088 --> 00:07:38,174
He looked quite natty.
Black tuxedo, tails, very slender.

152
00:07:38,383 --> 00:07:40,093
We're skipping.

153
00:07:42,637 --> 00:07:45,348
Well, then the vicar
began the ceremony.

154
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:49,018
He asked if anyone had a reason
why we shouldn't wed

155
00:07:49,185 --> 00:07:51,270
and that's when this...

156
00:07:51,896 --> 00:07:54,482
Well, this person stood up
and said that he did.

157
00:07:56,025 --> 00:07:58,194
He said that
he was the true love of my life,

158
00:07:58,361 --> 00:08:01,697
though he'd never had the courage
to say so.

159
00:08:01,864 --> 00:08:03,783
I feel so awkward telling you all this.

160
00:08:03,991 --> 00:08:06,869
Don't. I think I know
who this person is.

161
00:08:07,078 --> 00:08:08,371
- You do?
- Yes.

162
00:08:08,537 --> 00:08:12,375
Well, I don't see how you could.
I couldn't tell myself.

163
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:15,920
He was standing in the shadows
and I couldn't see his face.

164
00:08:16,128 --> 00:08:20,508
All I could make out was that
he was wearing a red bow tie.

165
00:08:21,509 --> 00:08:23,385
I don't have

166
00:08:24,762 --> 00:08:27,431
a clue why anyone would wear
such a thing to a wedding.

167
00:08:28,557 --> 00:08:32,937
Heavens, I can't believe I'm talking
about my visions to a psychiatrist.

168
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:34,647
Your brother would think I was daft.

169
00:08:34,813 --> 00:08:39,693
Well, Frasier's never really shared
my mystical, spiritual bent.

170
00:08:41,904 --> 00:08:45,950
This does mean I'm gonna have
to turn down Donny's proposal.

171
00:08:46,575 --> 00:08:49,953
- You don't think that would be crazy?
- Not at all.

172
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,498
Then you really believe
in psychic visions too?

173
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:54,249
I do.

174
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:57,878
Thank you, Dr. Crane.
That means a lot to me.

175
00:08:58,587 --> 00:09:03,383
Of course, if I can't marry Donny,
I can't very well go on dating him.

176
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:07,721
- That would just be leading him on.
- That's very true.

177
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:10,474
I don't know how
I'm gonna break it off with him.

178
00:09:10,641 --> 00:09:15,979
Well, do you wanna write a letter?
I have stationery and a fax machine.

179
00:09:16,855 --> 00:09:20,609
No. I have to tell him to his face.

180
00:09:21,485 --> 00:09:23,654
I do hate to let him go, though.

181
00:09:23,862 --> 00:09:26,490
I know it's hard,
but it's the only ethical thing to do.

182
00:09:27,824 --> 00:09:29,409
You're right.

183
00:09:31,703 --> 00:09:34,373
Now I see why people come to you.

184
00:09:34,581 --> 00:09:37,459
You always point them
in the right direction.

185
00:09:37,626 --> 00:09:42,297
Well, I'd be a poor excuse
for a psychiatrist if I didn't.

186
00:09:52,641 --> 00:09:55,644
- Hello, Dad.
- Hey, Fras.

187
00:10:01,524 --> 00:10:02,734
What's Eddie doing?

188
00:10:02,942 --> 00:10:04,444
Every time this cooking show
comes on,

189
00:10:04,611 --> 00:10:07,530
he rolls over and watches it
upside-down.

190
00:10:07,697 --> 00:10:09,282
He likes all the pouring they do.

191
00:10:09,449 --> 00:10:13,078
He thinks it's funny the way
the food goes up instead of down.

192
00:10:16,915 --> 00:10:19,000
- Evening.
- Hey, Daph.

193
00:10:19,167 --> 00:10:21,795
Donny called,
said he'd be here about 8.

194
00:10:21,961 --> 00:10:23,880
Do you think he'll pop
the question tonight?

195
00:10:24,088 --> 00:10:25,340
I hope not.

196
00:10:26,299 --> 00:10:27,342
What's the matter?

197
00:10:27,842 --> 00:10:29,719
I've decided to break up
with him tonight.

198
00:10:29,886 --> 00:10:32,472
What? You wanted
to marry him yesterday.

199
00:10:32,972 --> 00:10:36,017
Well, you know how I have
these visions from time to time.

200
00:10:36,184 --> 00:10:39,771
- And don't tell Dr. Crane. Well...
- Don't tell me what?

201
00:10:40,772 --> 00:10:42,690
- Nothing.
- It's my car again, isn't it?

202
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:44,650
It's not your bloody car.

203
00:10:44,859 --> 00:10:46,944
She's breaking up with Donny
because of some vision.

204
00:10:47,111 --> 00:10:49,072
I asked you not to mention that.

205
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,406
What vision?

206
00:10:51,074 --> 00:10:52,492
I know you'll make fun of me.

207
00:10:52,658 --> 00:10:55,328
But I had a vision that
I'm meant to be with another man.

208
00:10:55,536 --> 00:10:57,497
- Who?
- I couldn't see his face.

209
00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:01,584
I don't know anything about him.
He was just wearing a red bow tie.

210
00:11:02,126 --> 00:11:05,046
You're seriously gonna dump Donny
because of some psychic vision?

211
00:11:05,213 --> 00:11:07,590
Don't you think that's a little unwise?

212
00:11:07,798 --> 00:11:09,759
Well, your brother didn't think so.

213
00:11:11,802 --> 00:11:14,138
- Niles knows about this?
- Yes.

214
00:11:14,305 --> 00:11:17,725
He helped me to see that ending
things with Donny was my only choice.

215
00:11:17,892 --> 00:11:20,186
Unlike you,
he believes in my visions.

216
00:11:20,394 --> 00:11:22,813
He knows I have a gift.

217
00:11:23,647 --> 00:11:27,568
Yes. He's been trying to unwrap it
for six years.

218
00:11:34,241 --> 00:11:35,284
That'll be Donny.

219
00:11:35,493 --> 00:11:37,828
What do you think
about all this vision stuff?

220
00:11:38,037 --> 00:11:41,332
There's some psychological reason
that she's having second thoughts.

221
00:11:41,498 --> 00:11:45,044
It's got nothing to do
with an apparition in a red bow tie.

222
00:11:51,884 --> 00:11:54,178
Niles, you jackass,
will you take that thing off?

223
00:11:58,766 --> 00:12:01,477
I admit it's a departure for me,
but I'm feeling a bit kicky today.

224
00:12:01,643 --> 00:12:03,270
Yes, I know.

225
00:12:03,479 --> 00:12:06,732
Daphne told us you encouraged her to
follow her vision and to dump Donny.

226
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:11,195
I'm astonished at your lack of integrity.
Now, will you take that damn thing off?

227
00:12:11,403 --> 00:12:13,071
What did you hope
to accomplish with that?

228
00:12:13,238 --> 00:12:15,657
I was simply trying to nudge Daphne
into the realisation

229
00:12:15,824 --> 00:12:17,159
that I am the man in her vision.

230
00:12:17,326 --> 00:12:18,368
Niles.

231
00:12:18,577 --> 00:12:21,288
All right. But why else
would she come to me?

232
00:12:21,496 --> 00:12:24,499
Surely, you of all people realise
that there is some psychological basis

233
00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:26,418
for these visions of hers.

234
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:29,504
It represents a fear of some kind.

235
00:12:29,713 --> 00:12:31,923
A fear of intimacy,
a fear of commitment,

236
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:35,302
a fear of the Windsor knot.
Who knows?

237
00:12:37,095 --> 00:12:40,849
- Wasn't that Donny at the door?
- No, no, just Niles, Daphne.

238
00:12:41,016 --> 00:12:44,770
You know, we were just discussing
these visions of yours.

239
00:12:44,978 --> 00:12:46,938
Look, I'm in no mood to be mocked.

240
00:12:47,606 --> 00:12:49,900
I'm not mocking you, Daphne.

241
00:12:50,066 --> 00:12:52,861
And I'm not trying to influence you
in any way either.

242
00:12:53,028 --> 00:12:55,989
It's just that I was wondering...

243
00:12:56,198 --> 00:12:59,409
Have these psychic warnings
ever come to you before?

244
00:12:59,576 --> 00:13:03,204
Say, at a critical juncture
in a relationship.

245
00:13:03,413 --> 00:13:04,956
No.

246
00:13:05,749 --> 00:13:07,375
Well, actually, yes.

247
00:13:07,542 --> 00:13:09,544
Once when my first boyfriend
proposed,

248
00:13:09,711 --> 00:13:12,088
I had a vision telling me
there was someone better waiting,

249
00:13:12,255 --> 00:13:13,840
which there was, Clyde.

250
00:13:14,049 --> 00:13:15,175
But you dumped Clyde.

251
00:13:15,383 --> 00:13:18,595
Look, I don't have time
for this right now.

252
00:13:19,387 --> 00:13:22,474
Oh, yes,
no fear of commitment there.

253
00:13:22,682 --> 00:13:26,060
Well, it's just as possible that she
knew those men were wrong for her.

254
00:13:26,227 --> 00:13:28,146
- Isn't that right, Dad?
- Leave me out of this.

255
00:13:28,313 --> 00:13:31,608
<i>- I'm just looking for my TV Guide.
- Well, I could use a little support here.</i>

256
00:13:31,816 --> 00:13:34,110
Well, maybe that's why I said
to leave me out of it.

257
00:13:34,611 --> 00:13:36,696
I'm sorry, Niles.
I want you to be happy,

258
00:13:36,863 --> 00:13:39,824
but I'm with your brother on this.

259
00:13:40,033 --> 00:13:44,203
Niles, the fact is, you don't know
what causes these visions.

260
00:13:44,412 --> 00:13:46,372
And yet you still advised her
to walk away

261
00:13:46,539 --> 00:13:48,833
from a wonderful relationship.

262
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,461
It doesn't make you
much of a psychiatrist.

263
00:13:51,878 --> 00:13:53,046
That's your opinion.

264
00:13:53,212 --> 00:13:55,715
Yes, well, here's a second opinion.

265
00:13:55,882 --> 00:13:58,176
It doesn't make you
much of a friend.

266
00:14:03,306 --> 00:14:05,558
You sure you didn't throw it away
with the recycling?

267
00:14:05,725 --> 00:14:07,894
<i>Are you actually looking
for your TV Guide?</i>

268
00:14:08,102 --> 00:14:10,479
Well, I have to plan my weekend.

269
00:14:11,772 --> 00:14:15,693
You really do have the world
on a string, don't you, Dad?

270
00:14:16,569 --> 00:14:19,780
Look, Daphne, I have been thinking
about our talk this afternoon.

271
00:14:19,989 --> 00:14:23,117
I'm not sure I gave you
the best advice I could have.

272
00:14:23,326 --> 00:14:25,536
Perhaps what you call a vision

273
00:14:25,745 --> 00:14:28,914
is really a fear,
a fear of commitment, say.

274
00:14:29,081 --> 00:14:30,833
That would explain
why these visions

275
00:14:31,584 --> 00:14:34,295
come to you
when your relationships turn serious.

276
00:14:34,795 --> 00:14:40,217
Mind you, I can't tell you that I think
Donny is the right person for you,

277
00:14:40,426 --> 00:14:46,307
but I wouldn't want you to end things
with him for the wrong reasons.

278
00:14:47,766 --> 00:14:50,728
- Do you understand?
- Yeah.

279
00:14:51,061 --> 00:14:53,355
You're just like your brother after all.

280
00:14:53,522 --> 00:14:55,899
This afternoon you were just
humouring me, weren't you?

281
00:14:56,066 --> 00:14:58,444
- No, Daphne.
- Look at the idiot from Manchester.

282
00:14:58,652 --> 00:14:59,737
She thinks she has visions.

283
00:14:59,903 --> 00:15:02,865
No, no. I'm saying that I think
there are psychological issues here

284
00:15:03,073 --> 00:15:04,867
that you just don't entirely appreciate.

285
00:15:05,075 --> 00:15:08,454
Well, how could I?
I'm just some nut who believes in fate.

286
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:13,292
Well, I've always followed my vision
and your pity's not gonna change that.

287
00:15:13,876 --> 00:15:16,336
That'll be Donny.
Could one of you get the door?

288
00:15:18,213 --> 00:15:19,798
Well, you've seen me do it
enough times.

289
00:15:19,965 --> 00:15:21,800
You just turn the handle and pull.

290
00:15:27,848 --> 00:15:29,725
- Hello, Donny.
- Hi, Frasier.

291
00:15:29,933 --> 00:15:31,727
- Hey.
- Is Daphne ready?

292
00:15:31,893 --> 00:15:35,063
- She'll be out in a minute.
- That's good. Great.

293
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:37,190
- What's that you're drinking there?
- Sherry.

294
00:15:37,357 --> 00:15:39,860
Yeah, I'll have one.

295
00:15:40,027 --> 00:15:42,029
So how's business?

296
00:15:42,195 --> 00:15:43,947
Well, actually,
I've cut down on my caseload

297
00:15:44,114 --> 00:15:45,991
because I wanna spend more time
with Daphne.

298
00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:50,078
Don't tell her this, but I've book us
on an Alaskan vacation next month.

299
00:15:50,245 --> 00:15:54,249
I hear it's one of the few places left
where you can feel completely alone.

300
00:15:54,749 --> 00:15:57,210
You like that feeling, huh?

301
00:16:02,382 --> 00:16:05,510
- Donny.
- Oh, hi, honey.

302
00:16:08,763 --> 00:16:11,391
- You look really great.
- You too.

303
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,767
Shall we be on our way, then?

304
00:16:12,934 --> 00:16:15,520
Well, actually,
I've got something on my mind

305
00:16:15,687 --> 00:16:18,064
that I'd kind of like to talk about first.

306
00:16:18,273 --> 00:16:20,734
- Oh, well, we'll just get out of here.
- No, no, no, it's...

307
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,736
I'd like you to stay here for this.

308
00:16:22,944 --> 00:16:26,030
If it wasn't for all of you,
then I never would have met Daphne.

309
00:16:26,239 --> 00:16:28,992
- Donny, I think it'd be best if...
- It's okay. Sit.

310
00:16:33,621 --> 00:16:37,250
Maybe I'll just have
a little bit of this sherry.

311
00:16:40,169 --> 00:16:42,422
You know, I thought
that being a divorce attorney

312
00:16:42,589 --> 00:16:44,340
would've just soured me
on relationships,

313
00:16:44,507 --> 00:16:47,093
and then I met you.

314
00:16:47,302 --> 00:16:48,595
And now I find myself

315
00:16:48,803 --> 00:16:50,930
telling my clients to reconcile,

316
00:16:51,097 --> 00:16:54,392
because I think that if they could find
even just a tiny little bit

317
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:57,270
of the happiness
that I've found with you,

318
00:16:57,437 --> 00:16:58,813
they could make it.

319
00:16:59,856 --> 00:17:01,399
I've been thinking about that time

320
00:17:01,607 --> 00:17:03,860
we went to the little bed-
and-breakfast in the country,

321
00:17:04,026 --> 00:17:06,779
and we sat in that porch swing
all night

322
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:09,282
and looked at the sky.

323
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:11,868
You told me that your dad and you
used to sit on your stoop

324
00:17:12,034 --> 00:17:13,703
and do the same thing
when you were a kid.

325
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:18,207
He said that the only man
good enough for you

326
00:17:18,374 --> 00:17:22,378
would scoop the stars
out of the sky with his hat

327
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:25,298
and lay them at your feet.

328
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:28,217
Well...

329
00:17:30,052 --> 00:17:31,804
I've...

330
00:17:33,264 --> 00:17:36,183
I've only caught this one so far,

331
00:17:36,642 --> 00:17:38,436
but if you'll accept it,

332
00:17:38,602 --> 00:17:42,148
I'll spend my life chasing down
the rest of them for you.

333
00:17:43,607 --> 00:17:45,276
I know it's very soon,

334
00:17:45,818 --> 00:17:48,154
so just think about it.

335
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:52,741
I don't have to think about it.

336
00:17:53,117 --> 00:17:56,495
Yes. Oh, God, it's beautiful.

337
00:17:57,162 --> 00:17:59,498
Oh, Donny. Oh, God.

338
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:02,960
Thank you.

339
00:18:03,168 --> 00:18:05,504
Boys, give me a break.
You look more surprised than I do.

340
00:18:05,713 --> 00:18:07,131
No, no.

341
00:18:07,297 --> 00:18:08,716
No.

342
00:18:08,882 --> 00:18:10,718
We're just so happy for you.

343
00:18:10,926 --> 00:18:14,096
- Congratulations.
- Yes, it's wonderful, it's wonderful.

344
00:18:14,304 --> 00:18:15,931
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

345
00:18:16,098 --> 00:18:20,686
- If you'll excuse me, I need to...
- Yes, champagne. Let me help you.

346
00:18:23,147 --> 00:18:24,815
Oh, Niles.

347
00:18:24,982 --> 00:18:27,234
I'm so sorry.

348
00:18:30,904 --> 00:18:35,492
Frasier, why don't you take
the champagne in there?

349
00:18:35,826 --> 00:18:37,452
We're gonna stay out here
for a second.

350
00:18:37,619 --> 00:18:39,413
All right.

351
00:18:42,457 --> 00:18:44,668
I'd do anything to fix this for you.

352
00:18:44,876 --> 00:18:46,753
I know.

353
00:18:47,879 --> 00:18:49,464
It's my own fault.

354
00:18:49,631 --> 00:18:52,175
I had chance after chance
to tell her how I feel,

355
00:18:52,342 --> 00:18:55,470
and I always kept my mouth shut.

356
00:18:55,637 --> 00:18:58,723
Until tonight,
when I probably should have.

357
00:18:58,932 --> 00:19:02,769
Well, you can't regret what you said.
It was the right thing to do.

358
00:19:02,936 --> 00:19:06,398
And that's something
I can always count on from you.

359
00:19:07,983 --> 00:19:09,734
Thanks, Dad.

360
00:19:12,112 --> 00:19:13,780
I'm gonna get you
some of that champagne.

361
00:19:13,947 --> 00:19:17,242
- Oh, yeah, me too.
- Oh, just a second, Dr. Crane.

362
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:21,538
I'm sorry I got cross with you.

363
00:19:22,038 --> 00:19:25,375
Once I thought about what you said,
it really made sense.

364
00:19:25,542 --> 00:19:30,380
And then when Donny did ask me,
it was fear I felt, just like you told me.

365
00:19:30,547 --> 00:19:35,510
I figured the best way to overcome it
was to just jump in with both feet.

366
00:19:35,969 --> 00:19:37,011
Thank you for your help.

367
00:19:41,766 --> 00:19:45,061
- I wish you the very best, Daphne.
- Hey, hey, hey, don't squeeze so hard.

368
00:19:45,228 --> 00:19:47,272
That's a precious commodity
right there.

369
00:19:47,438 --> 00:19:51,109
My number one client here,
you know.

370
00:19:55,863 --> 00:20:00,660
<i>- Still looking for that TV Guide?
- Yeah, it's the damnedest thing.</i>

371
00:20:00,952 --> 00:20:02,912
What are you still doing up?
Where's Donny?

372
00:20:03,079 --> 00:20:05,623
He's on the phone with my folks.

373
00:20:05,832 --> 00:20:07,792
He really is wonderful, Mr. Crane.

374
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,711
I'm very happy for you, Daph.

375
00:20:14,257 --> 00:20:15,550
Oh, my God.

376
00:20:16,509 --> 00:20:18,469
I just had that vision again.

377
00:20:18,678 --> 00:20:20,471
Only this time...

378
00:20:20,638 --> 00:20:22,640
Oh, that's a bit scary.

379
00:20:22,807 --> 00:20:25,977
My mystery man is standing
with some sort of dragon.

380
00:20:26,602 --> 00:20:28,479
- A dragon?
- Yes.

381
00:20:28,688 --> 00:20:31,983
That makes no sense.
It must be just what Dr. Crane said.

382
00:20:32,149 --> 00:20:34,986
- These visions are about my fears.
- I guess.

383
00:20:35,194 --> 00:20:37,321
Imagine spending the rest of my life

384
00:20:37,488 --> 00:20:40,783
looking for some poor bloke
with a dragon.

385
00:20:45,621 --> 00:20:48,332
- That's weird.
- What?

386
00:20:48,499 --> 00:20:50,501
I just had a vision myself.

387
00:20:50,709 --> 00:20:52,044
What is it?

388
00:20:52,253 --> 00:20:54,588
There's a mystery woman.

389
00:20:54,755 --> 00:20:57,258
She's standing in the kitchen.

390
00:20:57,591 --> 00:21:00,511
She's making me
a Monte Cristo sandwich.

391
00:21:02,221 --> 00:21:05,808
- Oh, brother.
- No, no, it's just a grilled cheese.

392
00:21:06,016 --> 00:21:07,977
Make it yourself, you lazy old goat.

393
00:21:25,244 --> 00:21:27,955
Oh, Roz.
