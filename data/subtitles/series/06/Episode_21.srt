1
00:00:09,927 --> 00:00:13,680
Know where we should go tonight?
Frannie's Fish and Chips.

2
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:16,850
Dad, we're taking Niles out
to boost his spirits, not his cholesterol.

3
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:18,060
Oh, please.

4
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:21,021
That French food you guys eat
is full of butter and cheese.

5
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:23,690
But at least it's not prepared
by a woman working a deep fryer

6
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:26,318
in a batter-dipped brassiere.

7
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:29,029
- Hey, isn't that Niles?
- Where?

8
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:30,363
Driving that old hatchback.

9
00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:34,784
No, Niles would never be seen
in anything called a hatchback.

10
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:37,412
Although it does look a lot like him.

11
00:00:40,498 --> 00:00:42,334
My God, he's running away.

12
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:45,086
Well, catch him,
Mr. 12-Cylinder-German-Engineering.

13
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:53,803
<i>- Hello?
- Niles, what the hell are you doing?</i>

14
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:55,930
Well, I'm just pulling
into my parking garage.

15
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:58,224
<i>- You on your way?
- What are you talking about?</i>

16
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:01,436
- You're driving up Second Avenue.
- You're in that little red thing.

17
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:03,480
No, you must be
mistaking me for someone else.

18
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:05,690
See you when you get here.

19
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:09,944
He's getting away!
He just turned right at the corner.

20
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,531
<i>- Hello?
- Niles?</i>

21
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,742
What are you running for?
I can see that it's you.

22
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:18,369
No, you're mistaking me
for someone else.

23
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:19,579
<i>That is ridiculous.</i>

24
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:22,165
I can hear my own horn
through the phone.

25
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:27,378
Frasier, I may lose the connection.
I'm stepping onto my elevator.

26
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:29,172
I'll see you when you...

27
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:33,051
- What's the matter with him?
- Maris repossessed his car.

28
00:01:33,217 --> 00:01:34,969
That must've been
all he was able to afford.

29
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:36,888
He's just ashamed to admit it.

30
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,266
<i>- Hello?
- Niles, do not hang up on me.</i>

31
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:43,269
We know what's going on.
We're right behind you.

32
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:44,812
I was afraid this would happen.

33
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:48,441
I was petrified someone I knew would
see me driving this humiliating car.

34
00:01:48,649 --> 00:01:50,985
It looks like some buggy derailed
from a carnival ride,

35
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:54,405
except that
this has no safety features.

36
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:56,449
Oh, Niles,
you're worrying over nothing.

37
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:59,660
What kind of person judges you
by the sort of car you drive?

38
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:02,079
<i>- Mitzie Gill.
- Well, yes, she might.</i>

39
00:02:02,246 --> 00:02:04,415
<i>- She drives a Bentley.
- She's parking on the corner.</i>

40
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:05,833
She'll see me.

41
00:02:10,671 --> 00:02:11,922
Everybody all right?

42
00:02:12,131 --> 00:02:14,008
Dad, come quickly. I need your help.

43
00:02:14,216 --> 00:02:15,468
Oh, my God, what is it?

44
00:02:15,634 --> 00:02:18,888
<i>I need you to get up here
and pretend this is your car.</i>

45
00:02:26,812 --> 00:02:28,063
My shoulder is killing me.

46
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:30,232
Good Lord,
did you bang into the steering wheel?

47
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:33,903
No, I've been parallel parking all week
without power steering.

48
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,947
- Let me get you some aspirin.
- Oh, thank you, Dad.

49
00:02:37,114 --> 00:02:40,200
Check upstairs
in the bathroom off the study.

50
00:02:40,409 --> 00:02:41,577
Pardon the disarray, Frasier.

51
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:44,496
I've had to cut my cleaning lady
down to two times a week.

52
00:02:44,663 --> 00:02:47,583
Yeah, looks like a bomb went off.

53
00:02:48,417 --> 00:02:51,211
I gather your financial situation's
gotten a bit shaky.

54
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,131
Oh, yes. Every since I rejected
Maris' attempt to woo me back,

55
00:02:54,298 --> 00:02:56,133
she's been quite vindictive.

56
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,385
She's frozen all the accounts. Sherry?

57
00:02:58,594 --> 00:02:59,720
Thank you.

58
00:02:59,887 --> 00:03:02,181
My salary isn't even covering
my legal bills.

59
00:03:02,347 --> 00:03:03,932
Well, what do your lawyers tell you?

60
00:03:04,141 --> 00:03:08,228
Well, mostly that my salary
isn't even covering my legal bills.

61
00:03:12,107 --> 00:03:13,483
You know, Niles,

62
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:16,737
if this siege is going to continue,
you may have to tighten your belt a bit.

63
00:03:16,903 --> 00:03:19,614
Perhaps we should make up a list
of your expenses.

64
00:03:19,781 --> 00:03:22,075
All right. Here.

65
00:03:22,284 --> 00:03:24,077
Thank you. Oh, not with that pen.

66
00:03:24,286 --> 00:03:27,205
No, that once belonged
to Noel Coward.

67
00:03:27,414 --> 00:03:29,458
- I just purchased it.
- It is stunning.

68
00:03:29,624 --> 00:03:31,042
But if you're gonna be economizing,

69
00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:33,920
perhaps you'll have to forgo
the decorative antique pens.

70
00:03:34,087 --> 00:03:37,090
Could we at least review my list
before we make any drastic decisions?

71
00:03:37,299 --> 00:03:40,927
- Very well.
- That's my rent.

72
00:03:41,094 --> 00:03:44,306
- That's insurance.
- You pay that much in rent?

73
00:03:45,557 --> 00:03:47,350
Well, that includes
the building newsletter.

74
00:03:47,559 --> 00:03:49,603
It's outrageous.

75
00:03:49,769 --> 00:03:52,188
<i>- Niles, are you there?
- Yes, Dad.</i>

76
00:03:52,397 --> 00:03:54,316
Well, you can't blame me
for the housing market.

77
00:03:54,482 --> 00:03:55,567
This is a simple apartment.

78
00:03:55,734 --> 00:03:59,362
<i>I'm in some room with a lot of books,
but it doesn't have a bathroom.</i>

79
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:02,407
Oh, that's the library, not the study.

80
00:04:02,615 --> 00:04:03,825
Go down the hall, make a left.

81
00:04:03,992 --> 00:04:07,120
Yes, well, this simple apartment
of yours is gonna bankrupt you.

82
00:04:07,287 --> 00:04:09,247
You must admit
it's a bit large for one person.

83
00:04:09,456 --> 00:04:10,790
Well, don't forget I have a pet.

84
00:04:10,957 --> 00:04:15,295
Are you telling me that your bird
requires both a study and a library?

85
00:04:16,254 --> 00:04:18,089
All right, I will return
the Noel Coward pen,

86
00:04:18,256 --> 00:04:20,133
but this is my home.

87
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,218
This is a basic necessity.

88
00:04:22,886 --> 00:04:26,014
<i>Okay, I found the aspirin,
but I'm lost again.</i>

89
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:29,100
<i>I'm in a blue room
with big rolls of paper.</i>

90
00:04:29,309 --> 00:04:31,519
<i>That's the gift-wrapping room.</i>

91
00:04:34,022 --> 00:04:35,064
Look for the stairs.

92
00:04:35,231 --> 00:04:37,108
<i>The only stairs I could find go up.</i>

93
00:04:37,316 --> 00:04:39,694
You have a third floor?

94
00:04:40,236 --> 00:04:41,529
It's practically a crawlspace.

95
00:04:42,447 --> 00:04:45,533
Go out the door to the left.

96
00:04:48,119 --> 00:04:50,788
Don't look at me like that.
I have to have a roof over my head.

97
00:04:50,997 --> 00:04:53,166
Niles, you have three roofs
over your head.

98
00:04:53,374 --> 00:04:55,209
For God's sake,
come to your senses.

99
00:04:55,418 --> 00:04:56,919
Look at the numbers. They don't lie.

100
00:04:57,086 --> 00:04:58,713
I'm afraid you don't have any choice.

101
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,756
All right, now I'm stumped.
How do I get down?

102
00:05:00,923 --> 00:05:02,717
There's a bookcase
blocking my way.

103
00:05:02,925 --> 00:05:05,720
- The bookcase is a secret door, Dad.
- How do I open it?

104
00:05:05,928 --> 00:05:08,347
<i>- Poke Mrs. Dalloway on the bottom.
- What?</i>

105
00:05:08,556 --> 00:05:12,935
- The yellow book on the lower shelf.
- Oh, all right.

106
00:05:13,144 --> 00:05:15,229
Frasier, ever since I was a little boy,

107
00:05:15,396 --> 00:05:17,231
I have walked by this building
and wondered

108
00:05:17,398 --> 00:05:20,025
what sort of people could live
in such a magnificent place.

109
00:05:20,234 --> 00:05:21,485
I know, Niles.

110
00:05:21,694 --> 00:05:25,114
Getting in here
after Maris dumped me

111
00:05:25,281 --> 00:05:27,199
proved that I was not
a complete failure.

112
00:05:27,408 --> 00:05:28,576
I understand that.

113
00:05:29,785 --> 00:05:31,745
And I have no choice, do I?

114
00:05:32,329 --> 00:05:33,664
I'm sorry.

115
00:05:34,748 --> 00:05:36,125
You know,
perhaps you should move

116
00:05:36,292 --> 00:05:38,294
before you're obligated
for another month's rent.

117
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,462
You can stay at my place
until you find something.

118
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,340
Thank you.

119
00:05:43,507 --> 00:05:47,886
Here you go.
You can get your own glass of water.

120
00:05:49,346 --> 00:05:53,100
- This aspirin's expired.
- Well, it wasn't when I found it.

121
00:05:58,647 --> 00:06:01,066
- Oh, Dr. Crane, I'll clean up.
- Not necessary.

122
00:06:01,233 --> 00:06:02,776
You've been cooking dinner
every night.

123
00:06:02,943 --> 00:06:04,945
I hardly feel like
it's my kitchen anymore.

124
00:06:05,112 --> 00:06:08,699
Of course it's your kitchen.
No, no, that doesn't go there.

125
00:06:09,783 --> 00:06:12,911
I know it's probably
a bit presumptuous of me

126
00:06:13,078 --> 00:06:15,372
to rearrange your kitchen for you,
but I promise you,

127
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:18,375
you'll find it a lot more...

128
00:06:21,128 --> 00:06:23,171
...user-friendly.

129
00:06:24,256 --> 00:06:27,217
- Where's my jar of Bovril?
- No, I wasn't.

130
00:06:31,179 --> 00:06:35,100
Oh, the meat paste.
Well, I threw it out. It smelled rancid.

131
00:06:35,308 --> 00:06:38,395
Well, that's how it's supposed to smell.
It's English.

132
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:43,108
Well, I'm off to bed.

133
00:06:45,443 --> 00:06:47,445
Roz and I have a very important
breakfast meeting

134
00:06:47,612 --> 00:06:49,030
with a potential employer tomorrow,

135
00:06:49,197 --> 00:06:51,575
and I can't be burning
the midnight oil like you, Dad.

136
00:06:52,784 --> 00:06:55,870
- Dad?
- What? Oh, all right, I'll get a coaster.

137
00:06:56,037 --> 00:06:57,163
No.

138
00:06:58,081 --> 00:07:00,458
What's with you? You could
barely stay awake during dinner.

139
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:02,836
You'd be the same way
if you shared a room with Niles.

140
00:07:03,044 --> 00:07:06,631
All night long, up and down,
shifting and tucking.

141
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,259
If it's really annoying you,
I'll move his cot into my room.

142
00:07:09,467 --> 00:07:11,886
At least one of us in this family
could show him compassion.

143
00:07:12,053 --> 00:07:14,431
Good luck. Last night,
I got up and went to the bathroom.

144
00:07:14,597 --> 00:07:17,058
When I came back,
he'd made my bed.

145
00:07:32,907 --> 00:07:35,493
- Will you be much longer?
- Almost done.

146
00:07:35,702 --> 00:07:36,869
I only ask because Roz and I

147
00:07:37,036 --> 00:07:39,080
have this important job interview
tomorrow morning.

148
00:07:39,247 --> 00:07:41,332
I'd like to be well-rested.

149
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:44,585
- You've been in there for 20 minutes.
- No, I haven't.

150
00:07:45,086 --> 00:07:46,504
Now I have.

151
00:07:47,714 --> 00:07:50,049
You should try
this marvellous new facial peel.

152
00:07:50,258 --> 00:07:51,843
It's like getting ten years back.

153
00:07:52,051 --> 00:07:54,345
I'd settle for the last half hour.

154
00:07:54,512 --> 00:07:56,013
This is gonna be so much fun.

155
00:07:56,222 --> 00:07:58,850
Bunking together
like when we were kids.

156
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:05,815
Oh, yes.
It's all coming back to me now.

157
00:08:06,732 --> 00:08:08,067
I just want to tell you again

158
00:08:08,234 --> 00:08:10,653
how much I appreciate
your taking me in like this.

159
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:13,656
Not every brother in your position
would be so generous.

160
00:08:13,864 --> 00:08:17,284
Think nothing of it, Niles.
You're no trouble at all.

161
00:08:46,814 --> 00:08:51,110
Oh, dear, the sound of that rain's
gonna keep me up all night.

162
00:08:51,568 --> 00:08:55,239
I'm amazed you can hear it
over there in Mission Control.

163
00:08:56,699 --> 00:09:00,119
- Do you mind if I close the window?
- Not at all.

164
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,417
Much better.

165
00:09:12,214 --> 00:09:15,133
Niles, what are you talking about?
That's just more rain noise.

166
00:09:15,342 --> 00:09:16,510
No, it's much more than rain.

167
00:09:16,677 --> 00:09:20,138
This is all of the sounds
of the Brazilian rainforest.

168
00:09:21,098 --> 00:09:23,559
- Does it bother you?
- No.

169
00:09:24,351 --> 00:09:26,103
Just go to bed.

170
00:09:29,982 --> 00:09:31,942
Oh, for God's sake, Niles!

171
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:35,153
All right, all right,
I'll switch over to "Babbling Brook."

172
00:09:37,823 --> 00:09:40,367
You know, if you're feeling tense
about that interview,

173
00:09:40,534 --> 00:09:42,411
I could show you
one of my breathing exercises.

174
00:09:42,577 --> 00:09:45,664
No, no, just some sleep will do.

175
00:09:45,872 --> 00:09:48,208
- Good night.
- Good night.

176
00:10:11,189 --> 00:10:14,401
Oh, for God's sakes, Niles!

177
00:10:16,027 --> 00:10:19,280
- What the hell happened?
- Isn't it obvious? You blew a fuse.

178
00:10:19,447 --> 00:10:22,367
You haven't seen anything yet.

179
00:10:26,663 --> 00:10:29,207
I know he's on his way.
He must've gotten the address wrong.

180
00:10:29,374 --> 00:10:32,502
I knew I should've picked a place
he'd been to before.

181
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:35,630
- I'm sorry, I'm afraid I have to leave.
- Oh, please, don't leave.

182
00:10:35,797 --> 00:10:38,132
- Let me just try his cell phone.
- Very well.

183
00:10:39,884 --> 00:10:42,595
Hello, Frasier, it's Roz.

184
00:10:42,762 --> 00:10:45,306
You sound terrible. Where are you?

185
00:10:45,473 --> 00:10:46,808
The emergency room?

186
00:10:47,392 --> 00:10:49,686
Oh, my God! His appendix burst.

187
00:10:49,852 --> 00:10:51,396
No, no, no, no, don't apologize.

188
00:10:51,604 --> 00:10:53,564
It's not your fault.
We'll just reschedule it.

189
00:10:53,773 --> 00:10:56,192
I am so sorry I'm late.

190
00:10:56,359 --> 00:10:58,528
My usual, please.

191
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:01,280
My phone, please.

192
00:11:01,781 --> 00:11:03,866
Mr. Draper,
you're not leaving, are you?

193
00:11:04,033 --> 00:11:07,829
I have another meeting
and I don't like to keep people waiting.

194
00:11:07,995 --> 00:11:10,498
- I'm gonna kill you.
- Roz, please, I'm so sorry.

195
00:11:10,706 --> 00:11:12,208
- Where have you been?
- Blame Niles.

196
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:14,877
He kept me up late last night.
I slept right through my alarm.

197
00:11:15,086 --> 00:11:17,255
What's he still doing there?
Hasn't he found a place?

198
00:11:17,421 --> 00:11:19,173
No, he sublet his apartment
at the Montana.

199
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:22,218
He has to find something furnished.
There aren't that many out there.

200
00:11:22,385 --> 00:11:25,179
- Still, he's looking every day.
- Not yesterday.

201
00:11:25,388 --> 00:11:26,430
What do you mean?

202
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:30,351
<i>I saw him out in front of the Varsity
waiting in line for Lawrence of Arabia.</i>

203
00:11:30,518 --> 00:11:32,895
That's impossible. He told me
he had appointments all day.

204
00:11:33,062 --> 00:11:34,563
Frasier, I know Niles
when I see him.

205
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:38,025
How many people go to the movies
with their own seat cushion?

206
00:11:39,235 --> 00:11:41,195
You mean,
he hasn't even been looking?

207
00:11:41,362 --> 00:11:44,365
I don't know. Ask him yourself.

208
00:11:44,532 --> 00:11:46,283
Niles.

209
00:11:47,284 --> 00:11:48,619
- Frasier.
- Yes.

210
00:11:48,786 --> 00:11:51,455
Off for another day
of apartment hunting?

211
00:11:51,622 --> 00:11:53,415
Yes. Yes.

212
00:11:53,582 --> 00:11:56,001
Only hope I see as many
as I saw yesterday.

213
00:11:56,168 --> 00:11:57,336
Covered the whole waterfront.

214
00:11:57,503 --> 00:12:00,381
Oh, well, then you must have seen
the one on Crawford and Pike.

215
00:12:00,881 --> 00:12:04,259
- Yes, I think so.
- White with blue trim?

216
00:12:04,468 --> 00:12:06,678
Right next to the market.
Couple of flags out front.

217
00:12:06,887 --> 00:12:09,932
Yes, it looks nice from the outside.
It's completely unsuitable for living.

218
00:12:10,099 --> 00:12:14,228
Oh, yes. I'd imagine so,
seeing as it's a Chevron station.

219
00:12:15,229 --> 00:12:18,232
- What?
- You saw nothing.

220
00:12:18,398 --> 00:12:20,734
Nothing yesterday,
probably nothing in the last two weeks.

221
00:12:20,901 --> 00:12:24,154
- You've been going to the movies.
- That is an outrageous lie.

222
00:12:24,363 --> 00:12:27,407
Roz saw you and your seat cushion.

223
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:29,409
Here I was feeling sorry for you

224
00:12:29,618 --> 00:12:31,703
and you were lying to me
the whole time.

225
00:12:33,288 --> 00:12:34,831
I'm sorry.

226
00:12:35,207 --> 00:12:37,793
After the first day,
I just couldn't look anymore.

227
00:12:37,959 --> 00:12:40,420
I'll never find anything tolerable
in my price range.

228
00:12:40,587 --> 00:12:43,423
It's barely tolerable
having a price range.

229
00:12:43,632 --> 00:12:46,551
All right, Niles. Well, listen.
Today, I am going with you.

230
00:12:46,718 --> 00:12:48,929
It may be the only way
you ever find a place.

231
00:12:49,096 --> 00:12:51,056
You sound as if I plan
to stay with you forever.

232
00:12:51,264 --> 00:12:54,100
Well, I did notice you put a bottle
of '93 Pichon-Baron

233
00:12:54,267 --> 00:12:57,103
- on the grocery list last night.
- So?

234
00:12:57,312 --> 00:13:00,190
That wine's not even drinkable
for two years.

235
00:13:02,609 --> 00:13:05,946
And we've got a rec room too.
Did you see the hot tub?

236
00:13:06,112 --> 00:13:09,449
If you're referring
to that six-man Petri dish, yes.

237
00:13:09,616 --> 00:13:12,535
- I think we're about finished here.
- We can't leave without seeing it.

238
00:13:12,702 --> 00:13:16,206
Frank was kind enough to put on pants
and bring us up here.

239
00:13:17,123 --> 00:13:21,252
Welcome to the Shangri-la.

240
00:13:27,467 --> 00:13:31,554
Niles, it's magnificent.

241
00:13:36,226 --> 00:13:38,269
I think you'll see
why the Shangri-la is so popular

242
00:13:38,436 --> 00:13:40,647
with bachelors like yourself.

243
00:13:40,855 --> 00:13:42,273
I had assumed it was that charming

244
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:46,110
"No credit, no problem" banner
out front.

245
00:13:46,319 --> 00:13:48,613
Here's your kitchen, all modern.

246
00:13:48,821 --> 00:13:51,491
It looks like the previous tenant
left a four-slot toaster behind.

247
00:13:51,658 --> 00:13:52,992
Isn't that something, Niles?

248
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:54,661
You can make yourself
a club sandwich

249
00:13:54,827 --> 00:13:56,871
and still have a slice left for guests.

250
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:59,082
I think I've got the lay of the land.

251
00:13:59,248 --> 00:14:01,000
No, wait, we haven't seen
the bedroom yet.

252
00:14:01,167 --> 00:14:03,503
Right this way.

253
00:14:11,677 --> 00:14:13,262
Looks like
he left the sheets behind.

254
00:14:13,471 --> 00:14:14,931
Well, how's that for convenience?

255
00:14:15,097 --> 00:14:17,600
No dust bunnies under that bed.
No, sirree.

256
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,519
That is a vacuumer's dream, that is.

257
00:14:20,686 --> 00:14:23,272
Well, let's have a look
at this closet space, shall we?

258
00:14:23,439 --> 00:14:26,942
Oh, sorry, I thought Gary's sister
was supposed to pick this stuff up.

259
00:14:27,151 --> 00:14:29,737
Well, help yourself.

260
00:14:30,821 --> 00:14:34,825
This Gary certainly
seems to have left in a hurry.

261
00:14:34,992 --> 00:14:36,577
Did he leave no forwarding address?

262
00:14:37,953 --> 00:14:41,957
He left a note, but no.

263
00:14:43,292 --> 00:14:44,585
No address.

264
00:14:45,628 --> 00:14:48,589
Well, take your time.

265
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,510
- Now can we go?
- No, no, Niles.

266
00:14:53,677 --> 00:14:58,766
Not before we've had a look at this
very charming little ironing board here.

267
00:14:58,933 --> 00:14:59,975
There you are, see?

268
00:15:00,184 --> 00:15:02,102
You sure that's not the guest room?

269
00:15:05,773 --> 00:15:08,567
Niles, listen,
I know this isn't what you had in mind,

270
00:15:08,776 --> 00:15:10,152
but we have scoured the city.

271
00:15:10,319 --> 00:15:12,821
I'm afraid this is the only thing
we're gonna find.

272
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:15,657
Well, I wanna keep looking.
There's no rush.

273
00:15:17,367 --> 00:15:20,120
- Well, actually...
- What?

274
00:15:20,287 --> 00:15:21,789
Well, Niles...

275
00:15:23,123 --> 00:15:26,835
You want me to move out.
I've overstayed my welcome. I see.

276
00:15:27,002 --> 00:15:28,587
No, it's time for you to understand

277
00:15:28,795 --> 00:15:31,340
that your circumstances
have changed,

278
00:15:31,506 --> 00:15:33,217
and you're going to have to adapt.

279
00:15:33,425 --> 00:15:36,178
I don't want to adapt.
I want to go home.

280
00:15:36,345 --> 00:15:38,138
Niles,

281
00:15:38,347 --> 00:15:40,641
you are home.

282
00:15:45,937 --> 00:15:51,276
Well, where are my manners?
Can I get you some toast?

283
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:08,251
Yes.

284
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:13,173
Well, I'm off.
Oh, your brother called.

285
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,675
He said he won't be joining you
for the wine club tonight.

286
00:16:16,217 --> 00:16:18,178
Really? That's a first.

287
00:16:18,345 --> 00:16:21,639
You know, it's funny how much
Eddie misses that bird of Dr. Crane's.

288
00:16:21,806 --> 00:16:24,309
This morning,
a pigeon landed on the terrace.

289
00:16:24,476 --> 00:16:27,687
Eddie jumped up, excited,
ran over and started barking at it.

290
00:16:27,854 --> 00:16:29,105
Yes, he does that all the time.

291
00:16:29,272 --> 00:16:32,734
No, this was a different sort of bark.
Like, "You're not my bird.

292
00:16:32,942 --> 00:16:36,571
Don't fly here and get me hopes
up like that. You're not my bird."

293
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:41,326
It was silly and sad
at the same time, you know?

294
00:16:41,534 --> 00:16:43,620
Firsthand.

295
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:49,208
- Did Niles say why he cancelled at all?
- No.

296
00:16:49,417 --> 00:16:51,377
You know,
I just hope he's not depressed.

297
00:16:51,544 --> 00:16:55,298
I keep picturing him sitting
in that dreadful apartment all alone.

298
00:16:55,923 --> 00:16:58,926
Maybe I should've let him stay here
longer until he found something nicer.

299
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:00,970
I'm sure once he gets his books
on the shelf

300
00:17:01,137 --> 00:17:03,014
and his opera playing, he'll be fine.

301
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:05,016
You have nothing
to feel guilty about.

302
00:17:05,183 --> 00:17:09,395
Fras, your antique scout brought over
that Noel Coward pen you bought.

303
00:17:10,688 --> 00:17:13,274
Noel Coward pen?
Like the one your brother's got?

304
00:17:13,483 --> 00:17:17,320
Oh, it is his.
He returned it and I pounced on it.

305
00:17:17,528 --> 00:17:19,697
Dr. Crane's feeling bad
about moving his brother out.

306
00:17:19,864 --> 00:17:22,909
Oh, come on, Fras, he's a big boy.
You just gave him the push he needed.

307
00:17:23,492 --> 00:17:24,869
Well, he did need a push.

308
00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:28,122
Besides, I'm sure the place
you found him isn't as bad as all that.

309
00:17:28,289 --> 00:17:30,082
You're right, Daphne.
It isn't all that bad.

310
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:32,710
And once he's decorated it,
it'll be much nicer.

311
00:17:32,877 --> 00:17:36,422
You're right. You're right.
I'm being much too hard on myself.

312
00:17:36,589 --> 00:17:39,550
- He'll be happy at the Shangri-la.
- You got him in the Shangri-la?

313
00:17:39,717 --> 00:17:42,094
That's where Duke stayed
during his divorce.

314
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:46,015
Let me tell you,
that's my kind of place.

315
00:17:47,391 --> 00:17:49,685
What have I done?

316
00:17:58,861 --> 00:17:59,904
Hey, Niles.

317
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:01,447
- Dad, Frasier.
- Hello, Niles.

318
00:18:01,614 --> 00:18:03,657
Did you not get my message
about the wine club?

319
00:18:03,866 --> 00:18:05,868
We thought it'd be fun
to go out and have a meal.

320
00:18:06,035 --> 00:18:07,786
Oh, well, actually,
I'm on my way out.

321
00:18:07,995 --> 00:18:10,581
Where to? Bali-ha'i?

322
00:18:11,707 --> 00:18:14,209
No, they're having a Ping-Pong
tournament in the rumpus room

323
00:18:14,376 --> 00:18:17,463
and my neighbour Jimbo
has invited me to be his partner.

324
00:18:17,671 --> 00:18:20,007
Let me go and tell him
that I'll be a couple minutes late.

325
00:18:20,174 --> 00:18:23,302
If you're thirsty, they sent up some
wine coolers in my welcome basket.

326
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:24,845
Hey. And you were worried.

327
00:18:25,012 --> 00:18:27,389
He's making friends,
taking part in activities.

328
00:18:27,556 --> 00:18:32,102
Dad, he's obviously covering.
That shirt alone is a shriek for help.

329
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:34,813
Is it so hard for you to believe
that he could be happy?

330
00:18:35,022 --> 00:18:36,982
In this place, yes.

331
00:18:38,233 --> 00:18:39,276
You should stay.

332
00:18:39,443 --> 00:18:42,029
The guys in D building
are bringing over a 6-foot sub,

333
00:18:42,237 --> 00:18:45,824
and they've rigged the pinball machine
so it's free play all night.

334
00:18:46,033 --> 00:18:47,743
Niles, I'm finding it a bit difficult

335
00:18:47,909 --> 00:18:50,495
to accept this newfound enthusiasm
of yours.

336
00:18:50,704 --> 00:18:53,457
Weren't you the one who told me
I should adjust to my circumstances?

337
00:18:53,623 --> 00:18:56,334
I'm just concerned that you're
immersing yourself in this lifestyle

338
00:18:56,501 --> 00:18:58,170
to avoid feeling the pain
you're going...

339
00:18:58,378 --> 00:19:01,214
Would you leave the guy alone?
No, he's obviously having a good time.

340
00:19:01,381 --> 00:19:05,343
- I'm having a very good time.
- Why shouldn't he have a good time?

341
00:19:05,552 --> 00:19:08,346
I'd be happy here myself.
This is my kind of place.

342
00:19:09,097 --> 00:19:12,976
- Get me out of this hellhole.
- What did I say?

343
00:19:13,185 --> 00:19:16,271
I can't live this charade. I have tried.
It's taking too much out of me.

344
00:19:16,438 --> 00:19:19,524
Now, Niles, this place is fine.
And you know what they say:

345
00:19:19,733 --> 00:19:21,860
What doesn't kill you
makes you stronger.

346
00:19:22,068 --> 00:19:24,654
But, Dad, not everyone
makes it into that second group.

347
00:19:24,821 --> 00:19:28,241
And I've got the luau shirt to prove it.
Okay, that's it, that's it.

348
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:30,410
Enough is enough.

349
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:32,203
Niles, who are you calling?

350
00:19:32,412 --> 00:19:35,123
I'm calling Maris.
I'm going to beg her to take me back.

351
00:19:35,331 --> 00:19:36,875
- You don't wanna do that.
- Yes, I do.

352
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:39,419
Life with Maris wasn't so bad.
It was my fault, after all.

353
00:19:39,627 --> 00:19:41,463
I was too rigid.
I was always making demands.

354
00:19:41,629 --> 00:19:44,257
- No, Niles.
- Eat something. Unlock this door.

355
00:19:44,424 --> 00:19:46,551
- Don't throw that.
- Niles, give me that phone.

356
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:48,303
- No.
- You don't know what you're doing.

357
00:19:48,469 --> 00:19:50,305
- Yes, I do.
- Drop it and kick it over here.

358
00:19:50,471 --> 00:19:53,266
I won't. I'm dialling.
I'm pressing send.

359
00:19:53,474 --> 00:19:54,934
It's ringing.

360
00:19:55,143 --> 00:19:56,603
Maris.

361
00:19:56,769 --> 00:19:58,813
I'm calling...

362
00:19:59,022 --> 00:20:00,648
I'm calling...

363
00:20:03,026 --> 00:20:05,320
I'm calling to tell you
that there is a new address

364
00:20:05,486 --> 00:20:08,031
for forwarding my mail.

365
00:20:08,197 --> 00:20:13,119
It's 62 Elm Street,
Shangri-la Apartments.

366
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:15,538
Thank you.

367
00:20:17,373 --> 00:20:19,417
Well, good for you, Niles.

368
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:22,795
The second I heard her voice
I knew I couldn't go back.

369
00:20:23,796 --> 00:20:27,967
- But how am I ever going to live here?
- Now, it's just temporary, Niles.

370
00:20:28,175 --> 00:20:30,344
She can't drag
this divorce out forever.

371
00:20:31,095 --> 00:20:33,931
You know, Niles, perhaps this place

372
00:20:34,098 --> 00:20:36,934
is the price you'll have to pay
for your freedom.

373
00:20:38,728 --> 00:20:40,604
Well, it's worth that.

374
00:20:40,813 --> 00:20:44,233
Well, that's the way to look at it.
So let's have a toast to that.

375
00:20:44,442 --> 00:20:46,736
Thank you, Dad.

376
00:20:49,113 --> 00:20:51,073
You know,
I never did sign my lease.

377
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:54,452
I suppose
now is as good a time as any.

378
00:20:56,203 --> 00:20:58,581
Niles, perhaps
this will make it easier.

379
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:02,543
A little housewarming gift.

380
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,964
Thank you.

381
00:21:08,424 --> 00:21:10,134
There we go.

382
00:21:11,427 --> 00:21:13,137
Thanks, Dad.

383
00:21:13,304 --> 00:21:15,556
- Thank you.
- Okay.

384
00:21:15,723 --> 00:21:18,225
Here's looking at you, kids.

385
00:21:23,147 --> 00:21:24,231
You know, Niles,

386
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,942
you may have to sleep here,
but you don't have to eat here.

387
00:21:27,109 --> 00:21:28,652
How does Cigare Volant sound?

388
00:21:29,194 --> 00:21:30,237
Music to my ears.

389
00:21:30,404 --> 00:21:32,072
I can't go in that place
without a jacket.

390
00:21:32,239 --> 00:21:34,074
Maybe we should paw
through that closet.

391
00:21:34,241 --> 00:21:36,493
I bet Gary's got a jacket
that'll match those pants.

392
00:21:37,369 --> 00:21:41,290
- Oh, here we are.
- Yeah! Look at that. That's great.
