1
00:00:10,375 --> 00:00:13,086
Well, I'd better be heading out.
Niles and I are meeting for dinner.

2
00:00:13,295 --> 00:00:14,713
And then we have tickets

3
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,007
- to the theatrical event of the season.
- Really?

4
00:00:17,216 --> 00:00:19,635
<i>Yes. Sir Trevor Ainsley
in Tears of the Mariner.</i>

5
00:00:20,219 --> 00:00:21,970
It promises
to be a very exciting evening.

6
00:00:22,137 --> 00:00:26,725
You see, Seattle is Sir Trevor's
last stop on his farewell tour.

7
00:00:26,892 --> 00:00:29,353
After this,
he's retiring from the stage forever.

8
00:00:29,561 --> 00:00:31,897
<i>Tears of the Mariner.
I think I read a review of that.</i>

9
00:00:32,064 --> 00:00:35,067
<i>I thought it was one of those baseball
stories like Pride of the Yankees.</i>

10
00:00:35,317 --> 00:00:38,653
But it's just about some crabby
old sailor stuck in this little town...

11
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,948
No, no, Dad, please. I have carefully
avoided all the reviews of this play.

12
00:00:42,157 --> 00:00:44,326
I don't wanna hear about it
before I see it.

13
00:00:44,576 --> 00:00:47,370
Well, I don't wanna hear about it
after you see it.

14
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,582
- Oh, hello, Daphne.
- Hey, Daph.

15
00:00:50,749 --> 00:00:53,752
That's it? "Hello, Daphne"?
Haven't you seen the paper?

16
00:00:53,919 --> 00:00:56,171
No, I glanced at it. Why?
Did I miss something?

17
00:00:56,338 --> 00:00:57,380
Look.

18
00:00:57,589 --> 00:01:00,383
- Oh, my gosh. Is that you?
- Yes.

19
00:01:00,592 --> 00:01:03,428
Good heavens.
Well, it's kind of hard to tell.

20
00:01:03,595 --> 00:01:05,263
You've got your back
turned to the camera

21
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:06,973
and your skirt's blown up
around your...

22
00:01:07,182 --> 00:01:10,310
Oh, well, it must have been
rather blustery out.

23
00:01:10,518 --> 00:01:12,437
I was in the park yesterday.
This photographer

24
00:01:12,604 --> 00:01:14,773
snapped my picture
for the "It's Your Seattle" column.

25
00:01:15,023 --> 00:01:17,525
The one where they show
some average person out and about,

26
00:01:17,692 --> 00:01:19,277
then use their name on the column.

27
00:01:19,527 --> 00:01:21,112
If they took a picture of Mr. Crane,

28
00:01:21,279 --> 00:01:23,740
the caption would read,
"Martin Crane's Seattle."

29
00:01:23,948 --> 00:01:26,284
If they took one of you,
it would say, "Frasier Crane's..."

30
00:01:26,451 --> 00:01:27,744
Yes, we get it.

31
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:31,247
Don't crinkle it.
I want to send it home to my family.

32
00:01:31,456 --> 00:01:34,083
- You sure about that?
- Oh, don't be such an old fogy.

33
00:01:34,292 --> 00:01:36,461
So I'm bending down
and me knickers are showing a bit,

34
00:01:36,628 --> 00:01:39,881
but my family will still be as proud
as peacocks when they see that.

35
00:01:40,048 --> 00:01:42,467
"Daphne Moon's Seattle."

36
00:01:44,969 --> 00:01:46,846
She certainly does.

37
00:01:51,309 --> 00:01:53,978
Niles, will you just stop it?
The dinner was just fine.

38
00:01:54,145 --> 00:01:57,648
It was not fine. I made
those reservations weeks ago.

39
00:01:57,899 --> 00:01:59,358
They seated us
so close to the kitchen

40
00:01:59,567 --> 00:02:01,903
I'm surprised
they didn't make us wear hairnets.

41
00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:04,489
- I'm sure it was just a mix-up.
- Not a mix-up.

42
00:02:04,739 --> 00:02:06,407
It's part of an alarming trend
I've noticed

43
00:02:06,574 --> 00:02:09,118
- since Maris and I parted company.
- Oh, Niles.

44
00:02:09,327 --> 00:02:12,288
Last week, Roberta Phipps
snubbed me at the opera.

45
00:02:12,496 --> 00:02:14,290
I wasn't even invited
to that gala fundraiser

46
00:02:14,498 --> 00:02:15,791
for Saint Andrew's Orphanage.

47
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,336
You can still send money
to the children.

48
00:02:18,753 --> 00:02:20,504
As usual, you've missed the point.

49
00:02:22,256 --> 00:02:23,507
I'm being shut out.

50
00:02:23,674 --> 00:02:27,386
It is as if someone snuck into my world
and changed all the locks.

51
00:02:28,012 --> 00:02:29,472
Oh, Niles.

52
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,351
Well, at least you don't have to worry
about that tonight.

53
00:02:34,769 --> 00:02:37,188
- After you.
- Thank you. Evening.

54
00:02:37,354 --> 00:02:39,190
Tickets, please.

55
00:02:39,356 --> 00:02:42,193
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
These aren't for this performance.

56
00:02:42,443 --> 00:02:43,444
- What?
- What?

57
00:02:43,611 --> 00:02:46,280
But they say for the 16th.
There's the 16th right there.

58
00:02:46,447 --> 00:02:49,241
- That's today.
- Yes, sir. They were for the matinee.

59
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:51,827
No, no, this had to be some mistake.
Let me just...

60
00:02:52,036 --> 00:02:55,164
- Oh, dear God.
- I'm so sorry, Niles.

61
00:02:55,372 --> 00:02:58,584
Well, surely you must hold
some tickets aside for emergencies.

62
00:02:58,792 --> 00:03:01,837
- We'll take anything, anything at all.
- Yes, yes, even mezzanine.

63
00:03:02,046 --> 00:03:04,548
If you like, you can try your luck
in the cancellation line.

64
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:10,262
How could this happen?

65
00:03:11,555 --> 00:03:12,806
I have to see this play.

66
00:03:12,973 --> 00:03:14,683
I have to have people
see me see this play.

67
00:03:14,892 --> 00:03:17,561
- If I'm not seen seeing this play, see...
- Niles, Niles.

68
00:03:18,228 --> 00:03:19,605
I will make a simple phone call,

69
00:03:19,813 --> 00:03:21,899
and we'll get house seats
for tomorrow night.

70
00:03:22,149 --> 00:03:24,193
- All right?
- I suppose so.

71
00:03:24,401 --> 00:03:25,819
Come on, let's go.

72
00:03:25,986 --> 00:03:27,863
The last thing I need
is to have someone see us

73
00:03:28,071 --> 00:03:29,531
loitering here like gutter riffraff,

74
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:33,160
pathetically scrounging
for last-minute tickets.

75
00:03:37,998 --> 00:03:39,041
Good luck.

76
00:03:46,923 --> 00:03:47,966
- Oh, Niles.
- Hello.

77
00:03:48,175 --> 00:03:50,469
I know I'm early.
I was hoping we might get a bite to eat.

78
00:03:50,677 --> 00:03:51,678
Actually, Niles...

79
00:03:51,928 --> 00:03:54,639
It'll be on me as a thank-you
for getting those replacement tickets.

80
00:03:54,848 --> 00:03:56,725
- About the tickets...
- I know I owe you money.

81
00:03:56,933 --> 00:03:58,685
And my gratitude,
and if I keep talking,

82
00:03:58,852 --> 00:04:01,521
you won't be able to tell me
you weren't able to get the tickets.

83
00:04:01,771 --> 00:04:04,566
- I haven't been able to get them yet.
- I knew you wouldn't get them.

84
00:04:04,774 --> 00:04:06,610
- Niles, please.
- It's too late. It's 6:00.

85
00:04:06,776 --> 00:04:09,195
Please just calm down.
I've made a few well-placed calls.

86
00:04:09,362 --> 00:04:11,990
I haven't heard back from
a couple of people. Someone will call.

87
00:04:12,198 --> 00:04:14,034
Well, someone better call,

88
00:04:14,284 --> 00:04:16,244
because everyone who's anyone
is seeing this play.

89
00:04:16,453 --> 00:04:20,290
You know who you are
if you're not anyone? You're no one.

90
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:24,544
And I've been someone much too long
to start being no one now.

91
00:04:24,711 --> 00:04:27,547
Oh, hey, I thought no one was here.

92
00:04:28,381 --> 00:04:30,049
Niles, please, just relax.

93
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,343
One way or another,
we are going to get tickets.

94
00:04:32,552 --> 00:04:35,305
You two still going on
about those tickets?

95
00:04:35,555 --> 00:04:37,348
If this play's any good,
in a couple of years,

96
00:04:37,557 --> 00:04:42,145
they'll do it at the dinner theatre and
you can get a nice prime rib with it.

97
00:04:48,901 --> 00:04:52,822
Dad, you don't understand.
You see, this isn't just about the play.

98
00:04:52,989 --> 00:04:55,074
This is literally our last opportunity

99
00:04:55,241 --> 00:04:58,661
to see one of the finest actors
of our time.

100
00:04:58,911 --> 00:05:00,872
You wanna go because
your snobby friends are going

101
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,415
and you don't wanna feel left out.

102
00:05:02,665 --> 00:05:07,462
What we want is to sit in a theatre
and share a transcendent experience.

103
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:11,674
- That nobody else could get tickets to.
- That's the transcendent part.

104
00:05:14,427 --> 00:05:16,137
It's them.

105
00:05:16,846 --> 00:05:18,222
Hello?

106
00:05:18,431 --> 00:05:19,807
Yes, I'll hold. It's Clea Fenwick.

107
00:05:20,016 --> 00:05:21,684
- Clea Fenwick?
- Yes, you remember her.

108
00:05:21,934 --> 00:05:24,478
She's on the board of the theatre.
You've seen her. Bad eye job.

109
00:05:24,687 --> 00:05:26,647
Dowager's hump
you could cross the Sahara on.

110
00:05:28,107 --> 00:05:30,443
Hello, Clea, you lovely thing.

111
00:05:32,695 --> 00:05:35,656
Oh, well, you're a dear
for trying. Thanks.

112
00:05:35,865 --> 00:05:39,160
Don't despair, Niles.
I'm getting another call. Hello?

113
00:05:39,368 --> 00:05:41,454
Yes, Dora. Yes.

114
00:05:42,621 --> 00:05:45,541
Too bad. Well, thank you.
Yeah...

115
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:48,169
Oh, that is a wonderful idea.
Yes, I will.

116
00:05:48,377 --> 00:05:50,963
- Thank you. Bye-bye.
- She has a lead for us?

117
00:05:51,172 --> 00:05:53,007
Yes. She said I should call
Clea Fenwick.

118
00:05:56,719 --> 00:05:58,220
This is hopeless.

119
00:05:58,429 --> 00:06:01,974
Niles, there is another way.

120
00:06:03,142 --> 00:06:05,019
- You don't mean?
- Yes.

121
00:06:05,644 --> 00:06:07,813
I know it's a calculated risk.
It's a little uncertain.

122
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:11,233
- You can't be serious. It's unthinkable.
- Niles, what other choice do we have?

123
00:06:11,442 --> 00:06:14,236
But the indignity.
It reeks of desperation.

124
00:06:14,486 --> 00:06:16,280
Now, now,
before you do anything desperate,

125
00:06:16,488 --> 00:06:19,450
at least go and stand
in the cancellation line.

126
00:06:20,284 --> 00:06:22,744
What did he think
we were talking about?

127
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:30,586
You know, this isn't half
as humiliating as I thought it would be.

128
00:06:30,752 --> 00:06:33,380
Oh, you're right.
I don't know why we were so afraid.

129
00:06:35,257 --> 00:06:37,384
Oh, no.
There's Steven and Susan Kendall.

130
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:42,264
Quick, turn around.
If they see us here, we'll be ruined.

131
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,932
- They know everybody.
- Yes, I know.

132
00:06:44,099 --> 00:06:47,644
Their Sunday brunches
are a who's who of Seattle's elite.

133
00:06:49,354 --> 00:06:51,648
I think it's safe. No one saw us.

134
00:06:51,857 --> 00:06:54,276
- Hey, Frasier, Niles.
- Hi, Roz.

135
00:06:54,443 --> 00:06:57,487
- What are you doing here?
- And how did you get tickets?

136
00:06:57,696 --> 00:06:59,823
A friend couldn't use hers
so she gave them to me.

137
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:04,161
I asked my cute new dentist.
He's a big fan of Sir What's-his-face.

138
00:07:04,369 --> 00:07:06,413
You refer to the world's greatest
living actor as...

139
00:07:06,621 --> 00:07:08,748
Now, Frasier, Roz may not
be familiar with Sir Trevor,

140
00:07:08,957 --> 00:07:10,458
but I'm sure she'll enjoy the play.

141
00:07:10,709 --> 00:07:13,003
- I trust you got good seats.
- I think so.

142
00:07:13,878 --> 00:07:17,007
- Row C.
- Row C. Excellent.

143
00:07:17,215 --> 00:07:19,592
Look, a whole bunch of naked men.

144
00:07:20,969 --> 00:07:22,095
What are you doing?

145
00:07:22,303 --> 00:07:24,014
Give me those.
You don't even know his name.

146
00:07:24,222 --> 00:07:26,224
Are you crazy?

147
00:07:28,476 --> 00:07:30,186
- Ready to go, Roz?
- Yes.

148
00:07:30,395 --> 00:07:32,564
- Dr. Mandel?
- Oh, hi, Niles.

149
00:07:32,772 --> 00:07:33,815
You two know each other?

150
00:07:33,982 --> 00:07:36,985
Sure.
How's the teeth bleaching going?

151
00:07:38,069 --> 00:07:39,362
Fine, thanks.

152
00:07:42,907 --> 00:07:43,950
Let's go, Rob.

153
00:07:44,158 --> 00:07:47,829
It's a long way to Row C
from the cancellation line.

154
00:07:48,329 --> 00:07:51,666
Hang in there, guys.
I wouldn't be surprised if you get lucky.

155
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:53,960
I'd be stupefied if you didn't.

156
00:07:58,423 --> 00:08:01,509
I knew you were bleaching them.

157
00:08:01,676 --> 00:08:04,387
"No, really,
I just changed toothpastes."

158
00:08:04,595 --> 00:08:08,182
Is that Niles Crane? And Frasier?

159
00:08:08,433 --> 00:08:12,353
- Susan, Steven, good to see you.
- We're seeing everybody tonight.

160
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,688
It's simply...

161
00:08:13,938 --> 00:08:16,983
Oh, dear. You're not waiting
for a cancellation, are you?

162
00:08:17,191 --> 00:08:21,404
A what? Oh, is that what this is?

163
00:08:25,616 --> 00:08:27,159
Oh, look at us.

164
00:08:27,368 --> 00:08:29,787
Blocking these poor unfortunates
who couldn't get tickets.

165
00:08:30,037 --> 00:08:31,706
I got one pair left. Who's next?

166
00:08:32,206 --> 00:08:35,001
- Curtain going up.
- Curtain going up. Shall we?

167
00:08:35,543 --> 00:08:38,295
- Next in line, please.
- Niles, are you coming?

168
00:08:40,047 --> 00:08:43,217
You'll have to forgive Niles.

169
00:08:43,384 --> 00:08:44,885
He's too ashamed to admit

170
00:08:45,136 --> 00:08:47,888
that he's just waiting
for one last cigarette.

171
00:08:48,139 --> 00:08:49,348
It's all right. You go ahead.

172
00:08:49,557 --> 00:08:52,560
- I'll just see the Kendalls in.
- Thank God, another smoker.

173
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:55,354
Darling, maybe I'll just stay
and have a cigarette with Niles.

174
00:08:55,563 --> 00:08:57,731
Do you want these tickets, sir?

175
00:08:57,898 --> 00:08:58,941
Me?

176
00:09:02,069 --> 00:09:05,739
No, no, no.

177
00:09:05,906 --> 00:09:08,409
Steven, please,
I'd really like to sit down.

178
00:09:08,575 --> 00:09:10,369
All right. Niles, we'll make a date.

179
00:09:10,577 --> 00:09:12,955
I'll meet you here at intermission
and we'll have a smoke.

180
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:16,166
Right here is where I'll be.

181
00:09:17,334 --> 00:09:19,962
- Enjoy.
- See you later.

182
00:09:22,506 --> 00:09:24,716
Well, this is just perfect.

183
00:09:24,925 --> 00:09:27,302
Not only are we missing the play,
but we have to hang around

184
00:09:27,469 --> 00:09:29,388
until intermission
so they won't catch on to us.

185
00:09:29,596 --> 00:09:30,848
What are you complaining about?

186
00:09:31,014 --> 00:09:33,934
I'm the one who has an hour
to learn how to smoke.

187
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,778
Niles, they're coming out.

188
00:09:45,028 --> 00:09:46,363
Come on, let's blend in.

189
00:09:50,409 --> 00:09:52,619
- Niles, what are you doing?
- I'm practising.

190
00:09:52,786 --> 00:09:54,955
I haven't held a cigarette
since I played Duke Mantee

191
00:09:55,122 --> 00:09:57,290
<i>in our junior high production
of The Petrified Forest.</i>

192
00:09:57,457 --> 00:10:00,669
Yes, I remember watching you
from the petrified audience. Come on.

193
00:10:01,294 --> 00:10:03,755
Oh, there they are. Let's go.

194
00:10:03,964 --> 00:10:06,341
- Oh, well, you got out here quickly.
- Yeah.

195
00:10:06,591 --> 00:10:08,468
I guess you needed one of these
more than I did.

196
00:10:08,677 --> 00:10:12,180
Yes, well, when you enjoy smoking
as much as I do.

197
00:10:16,518 --> 00:10:20,397
Bye-bye, feel better. I'll call you.

198
00:10:20,647 --> 00:10:22,399
The Gormleys.
Kendra isn't feeling well.

199
00:10:22,565 --> 00:10:24,818
- Richard is taking her home.
- Oh, well.

200
00:10:25,068 --> 00:10:27,654
- There's Miggy and Lyle.
- Poor old dears.

201
00:10:27,821 --> 00:10:29,280
They could only get balcony.

202
00:10:29,531 --> 00:10:33,410
Still, we should say hello.
They are your parents. Excuse us.

203
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,036
Yes.

204
00:10:39,249 --> 00:10:41,334
Thank God.
Those things are turning me green.

205
00:10:41,501 --> 00:10:44,295
Never mind that, Niles.
The Gormleys aren't coming back.

206
00:10:44,504 --> 00:10:46,631
Let's sneak into their seats
and watch the second act.

207
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,341
Come on, let's go.

208
00:10:48,508 --> 00:10:51,177
- Your ticket stubs, please.
- Oh, I beg your pardon?

209
00:10:51,427 --> 00:10:54,597
I'm sorry, we've had some people
try to sneak in after intermission.

210
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:59,727
Well, you know,
I think we left our coats in our seats,

211
00:10:59,936 --> 00:11:01,813
and the stubs are in the coats.

212
00:11:02,021 --> 00:11:03,856
- Oh, well, don't worry about it.
- Thank you.

213
00:11:04,023 --> 00:11:05,566
We'll have someone
bring your coats.

214
00:11:05,775 --> 00:11:06,943
Where are your seats?

215
00:11:09,195 --> 00:11:12,698
I'll have to check the seating chart.

216
00:11:14,617 --> 00:11:16,577
- Aren't you going in?
- Oh, yes, yes.

217
00:11:16,786 --> 00:11:19,455
My brother just needed to have
one last cigarette.

218
00:11:19,622 --> 00:11:21,791
- Oh, you're worse than Steven.
- Yes, yes.

219
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:24,710
Really, Niles, I do wish you'd quit.
I'm begging you.

220
00:11:25,211 --> 00:11:29,048
I just wish I didn't love
the damn things so much.

221
00:11:29,298 --> 00:11:32,677
Yes, well, if we don't see you
afterward, have a lovely evening.

222
00:11:32,885 --> 00:11:35,137
Actually,
we're having a small supper

223
00:11:35,388 --> 00:11:37,348
at La Chanteuse afterwards
for Sir Trevor.

224
00:11:37,556 --> 00:11:40,643
So if you're not busy,
say, around 11?

225
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,191
Good. We'll see you then.

226
00:11:49,568 --> 00:11:51,362
Frasier.

227
00:11:52,947 --> 00:11:55,366
Dinner with Sir Trevor.
That's better than seeing the play.

228
00:11:55,574 --> 00:11:57,576
Niles, are you insane?

229
00:11:57,743 --> 00:11:59,995
We know absolutely nothing
about the damn play.

230
00:12:00,204 --> 00:12:02,873
How can we possibly talk
with this man?

231
00:12:03,082 --> 00:12:05,876
For God's sake, I just wish I'd read
that review in yesterday's paper.

232
00:12:06,085 --> 00:12:08,796
- Do you still have it?
- I might.

233
00:12:09,046 --> 00:12:10,881
Dad lets the papers
pile up for days sometimes.

234
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:13,884
You know what? We've got just
enough time to get there and back.

235
00:12:14,093 --> 00:12:15,678
- Let's go.
- Where are you going?

236
00:12:15,886 --> 00:12:19,348
You see?
I told you it was the other way.

237
00:12:20,265 --> 00:12:21,767
Now.

238
00:12:23,936 --> 00:12:26,480
- What's going on?
- We're looking for yesterday's paper.

239
00:12:26,688 --> 00:12:28,732
- Well, it should be there.
- Oh, wait, Dad.

240
00:12:28,941 --> 00:12:31,318
<i>That review you're reading yesterday,
Tears of the Mariner.</i>

241
00:12:31,527 --> 00:12:32,736
- Do you remember it?
- Kind of.

242
00:12:32,945 --> 00:12:35,322
All right, just concentrate.
What was the play about?

243
00:12:35,531 --> 00:12:37,449
Well, let me see.

244
00:12:37,616 --> 00:12:40,994
It started out with this old guy
who was gutting a fish.

245
00:12:41,203 --> 00:12:42,246
All right, okay, good.

246
00:12:42,454 --> 00:12:45,999
And then he gives this fish to his son,
but his son rejects it.

247
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:47,376
Good, good. Then what?

248
00:12:49,127 --> 00:12:52,339
Oh, yeah. Well, then it turns out
that he has this fatal disease.

249
00:12:52,547 --> 00:12:55,425
And the next thing you know,
he's in this big stadium,

250
00:12:55,634 --> 00:12:58,428
and he's telling everybody
that even though he's dying,

251
00:12:58,637 --> 00:13:01,848
that today, he considers himself
the luckiest man...

252
00:13:02,057 --> 00:13:03,725
<i>Dad, that is Pride of the Yankees.</i>

253
00:13:04,309 --> 00:13:07,062
Oh, yeah, yeah, that's right. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry about that.

254
00:13:07,229 --> 00:13:09,856
But I'm pretty sure
that fish part was right.

255
00:13:10,065 --> 00:13:13,318
- This is ridiculous.
- Fish part.

256
00:13:13,568 --> 00:13:14,653
- Wait, wait. Yes.
- Yes.

257
00:13:14,903 --> 00:13:15,946
Here it is. There it is.

258
00:13:16,154 --> 00:13:19,282
<i>"Sir Trevor Ainsley's bravura
performance in Tears of the Mariner</i>

00:13:26,915 --> 00:13:28,416
Just give me a second here.

262
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:33,922
- Where is it?
- Daphne.

263
00:13:34,089 --> 00:13:35,799
Her picture must've been
on the other side.

264
00:13:36,132 --> 00:13:38,426
It may still be here.
She was gonna mail it to her mother.

265
00:13:38,593 --> 00:13:40,887
Daphne's picture was in the paper?

266
00:13:41,096 --> 00:13:44,182
Yes, well, someone snapped
a candid photo of her in the park.

267
00:13:44,432 --> 00:13:47,310
It's not her most flattering angle,
but I'm sure you would disagree.

268
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:48,770
Well, open it.

269
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,939
Carefully.

270
00:13:51,105 --> 00:13:53,608
Oh, what the hell.
I'll buy her flowers.

271
00:13:54,776 --> 00:13:57,445
Hey, Dr. Crane,
I thought you went...?

272
00:13:58,363 --> 00:14:01,532
- Is that my letter?
- Daphne, let me explain.

273
00:14:01,741 --> 00:14:03,910
I should've known
I'd never get privacy in this house.

274
00:14:04,118 --> 00:14:05,495
You don't understand. I wanted to...

275
00:14:05,703 --> 00:14:08,831
You just wanted to find out if
I was gossiping about you to my mum.

276
00:14:08,998 --> 00:14:11,209
Well, fine, I was.

277
00:14:11,459 --> 00:14:14,212
A 73-year-old woman
in Manchester is about to find out

278
00:14:14,379 --> 00:14:16,297
that you dye the grey
out of your temples.

279
00:14:16,464 --> 00:14:17,632
There, you happy?

280
00:14:17,882 --> 00:14:21,010
No, I'm not happy. I am mortified.

281
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:24,472
How did you know that?

282
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:29,810
I keep my hair dye
in the false bottom of my cufflink box.

283
00:14:30,311 --> 00:14:34,774
Yeah, well, I'll let it go this time.

284
00:14:36,901 --> 00:14:39,695
We haven't got time for this.
We've gotta get down to that party.

285
00:14:39,904 --> 00:14:42,573
- I knew you were dying your hair.
- Shut up.

286
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:44,617
"No, no, really,
it's just my new conditioner."

287
00:14:44,825 --> 00:14:46,285
Shut up.

288
00:14:49,163 --> 00:14:51,957
And whatever you do,
don't get specific about the play.

289
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:53,626
That's the mistake
you made last year

290
00:14:53,834 --> 00:14:55,503
<i>when you lied about seeing
The Silent Echo.</i>

291
00:14:55,753 --> 00:14:58,589
All that yammering on about
how the play had third-act problems.

292
00:14:58,756 --> 00:15:00,674
- It fooled no one.
- What makes you so sure?

293
00:15:00,841 --> 00:15:04,512
<i>Well, for starters, The Silent Echo
doesn't have a third act.</i>

294
00:15:10,267 --> 00:15:12,269
Bravo!

295
00:15:14,521 --> 00:15:16,023
Thank you.

296
00:15:16,231 --> 00:15:18,776
God, I need a drink.

297
00:15:18,943 --> 00:15:21,945
- Double Scotch, no ice.
- Yes, sir.

298
00:15:22,529 --> 00:15:24,907
Frasier, Niles. How nice.

299
00:15:25,115 --> 00:15:26,742
Sir Trevor, this is Dr. Frasier Crane.

300
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:29,078
- And his brother, Dr. Niles Crane.
- It's an honour.

301
00:15:29,286 --> 00:15:31,580
- How do you do?
- Two of our pre-eminent psychiatrists.

302
00:15:31,789 --> 00:15:33,040
- We're huge fans.
- Huge.

303
00:15:33,207 --> 00:15:35,834
They've set up a table for us
in the private room. Shall we?

304
00:15:36,043 --> 00:15:38,837
No, I'll just finish this
and be right along.

305
00:15:39,046 --> 00:15:41,256
Perhaps the two doctors
will keep me company.

306
00:15:41,465 --> 00:15:47,387
I'd love to hear a psychological
interpretation of the play.

307
00:15:47,596 --> 00:15:49,806
All right, but don't be too long.

308
00:15:50,057 --> 00:15:54,811
So tell me,
as students of the human psyche,

309
00:15:55,062 --> 00:15:57,606
did my character ring true?

310
00:15:58,649 --> 00:16:00,233
Oh, yes, so true.

311
00:16:00,609 --> 00:16:04,279
I can honestly say
I never saw a false moment.

312
00:16:06,156 --> 00:16:07,991
Well, what about the third act?

313
00:16:08,241 --> 00:16:11,119
The play clearly
has a third-act problem.

314
00:16:11,328 --> 00:16:12,746
At least it has a third act,

315
00:16:12,913 --> 00:16:16,208
<i>unlike The Silent Echo
which really could have used one.</i>

316
00:16:19,503 --> 00:16:20,587
I quite agree.

317
00:16:20,837 --> 00:16:24,216
<i>I did The Silent Echo
in London last year.</i>

318
00:16:24,424 --> 00:16:26,968
What did you think
of the hat scene?

319
00:16:31,681 --> 00:16:33,224
The hat scene. Well...

320
00:16:33,433 --> 00:16:36,144
You know, the most important thing
about the hat scene,

321
00:16:36,353 --> 00:16:38,646
and I have to stress this...
Dear God, is that clock right?

322
00:16:38,855 --> 00:16:42,650
I have to call the sitter and tell her I'm
going to be late, the children worry so.

323
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:47,906
- Well, back to the play.
- Right.

324
00:16:48,114 --> 00:16:50,074
Well, you, of course, were brilliant.

325
00:16:50,283 --> 00:16:54,162
Oh, please, Dr. Crane, I just want

326
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:57,624
your professional analysis
of what you saw tonight.

327
00:17:00,293 --> 00:17:02,629
Well, it...

328
00:17:03,796 --> 00:17:08,468
Of course, I could discuss subtext,
metaphor and imagery with you,

329
00:17:08,635 --> 00:17:10,553
but you see, I...

330
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,056
I come to the theatre

331
00:17:13,222 --> 00:17:15,224
to feel,

332
00:17:15,391 --> 00:17:17,352
to be moved.

333
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:21,564
And that's exactly
what happened to me tonight.

334
00:17:21,814 --> 00:17:23,524
Really?

335
00:17:24,567 --> 00:17:26,569
When?

336
00:17:32,492 --> 00:17:35,244
When? Well, let me see.

337
00:17:35,453 --> 00:17:39,498
It was... There was that...

338
00:17:40,082 --> 00:17:41,375
The gutting-the-fish scene.

339
00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:46,756
You made
the most heartbreaking gesture.

340
00:17:46,922 --> 00:17:50,718
It was, you know,

341
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:54,347
the one with your hands. You...

342
00:17:57,683 --> 00:18:00,853
You mean,
when I offer the fish to my son,

343
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:05,983
and he turns his back to me,
and I reach out to him like this:

344
00:18:06,192 --> 00:18:10,070
Yes, it's even more moving
the second time.

345
00:18:10,279 --> 00:18:11,614
Well...

346
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:16,368
Who knows why a moment like that
touches us so? But...

347
00:18:17,661 --> 00:18:20,748
You see, that is your gift, Sir Trevor.

348
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:23,917
You've given us

349
00:18:24,126 --> 00:18:26,253
hundreds of moments.

350
00:18:26,462 --> 00:18:30,632
Moments so real, so compelling,

351
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:34,636
that we are revealed in their truth.

352
00:18:36,305 --> 00:18:39,683
You don't know
how refreshing this is

353
00:18:39,892 --> 00:18:42,186
to meet someone
who doesn't just come to the theatre

354
00:18:42,394 --> 00:18:45,355
but who gives himself over to it.

355
00:18:45,564 --> 00:18:49,151
That crowd in there, they only come
because it's fashionable.

356
00:18:49,401 --> 00:18:51,111
They don't care about art.

357
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,739
I can spot them at a glance.

358
00:18:54,907 --> 00:18:57,618
The poseurs, the frauds.

359
00:18:57,826 --> 00:19:00,579
Oh, here comes your brother.

360
00:19:03,915 --> 00:19:05,167
The kids are fine.

361
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:11,673
Excuse me, Sir Trevor, they're waiting
for you in the dining room.

362
00:19:11,882 --> 00:19:13,550
Very well.

363
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:20,557
And thank you, Dr. Crane,
for your integrity and your passion.

364
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:26,062
You are the reason that actors act.

365
00:19:35,363 --> 00:19:38,408
I'm sorry I deserted you,
but obviously you carried the day.

366
00:19:38,617 --> 00:19:42,495
- Bravo.
- Oh, yes, bravo for us.

367
00:19:43,955 --> 00:19:45,749
What do you mean?

368
00:19:45,957 --> 00:19:47,792
Do you realise
what we missed tonight?

369
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:51,588
A potentially life-changing experience
in the theatre.

370
00:19:51,796 --> 00:19:53,673
And why?

371
00:19:53,882 --> 00:19:58,178
Because we were too embarrassed
to be seen in a cancellation line.

372
00:19:58,386 --> 00:20:01,139
Well, admittedly, it was a bit shallow.

373
00:20:01,306 --> 00:20:05,018
Yes, it was more than shallow,
it was shameful.

374
00:20:06,186 --> 00:20:07,937
You're right.

375
00:20:08,146 --> 00:20:09,147
What were we thinking,

376
00:20:09,314 --> 00:20:11,900
kowtowing to a group of snobs
like that?

377
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:15,153
We weren't thinking.
Come on, let's get out of here.

378
00:20:15,403 --> 00:20:17,113
Frasier, Niles.

379
00:20:17,322 --> 00:20:19,866
Oh, Susan, I'm so sorry,
but we can't stay.

380
00:20:20,074 --> 00:20:22,618
Oh, no.
Sir Trevor will be so disappointed.

381
00:20:22,827 --> 00:20:24,579
He was quite taken with you.

382
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:27,999
Well, send him our apologies.

383
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:30,001
It really was wonderful to meet him.

384
00:20:30,918 --> 00:20:33,421
I know this is short notice,
but if you're free this weekend,

385
00:20:33,588 --> 00:20:35,590
we're having
one of our Sunday brunches.

386
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,552
Senator Logan is coming
and Maria de Falco and the Whitneys...

387
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,555
- Just thank you, but I'm afraid we...
- Oh, please try.

388
00:20:42,763 --> 00:20:46,767
I'll hold it open for you.
Check your books and let me know.

389
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:53,816
Well, how's that for irony?

390
00:20:54,025 --> 00:20:55,651
Sunday brunch at the Kendalls'.

391
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,903
An hour ago, we would have leapt
at that invitation.

392
00:20:58,112 --> 00:21:00,031
Not anymore.

393
00:21:00,197 --> 00:21:03,951
We've got a damned sight
too much integrity.

394
00:21:07,538 --> 00:21:09,415
Although...

395
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:12,793
Are we being selfish?

396
00:21:13,043 --> 00:21:15,838
- Possibly. How?
- Here's my thinking.

397
00:21:16,463 --> 00:21:18,340
Why do shallow people
remain that way?

398
00:21:18,549 --> 00:21:20,801
The lack of positive influence.

399
00:21:21,051 --> 00:21:23,387
Perhaps our brand of integrity
is what that group needs.

400
00:21:23,554 --> 00:21:26,181
We can be like politicians who
change the system from within.

401
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:29,393
Exactly. And who knows?
Maybe it'll rub off on Senator Logan.

402
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,729
- He'll bring it back to Washington.
- We have to go.

403
00:21:31,979 --> 00:21:33,230
Yes. What are you wearing?

404
00:21:33,397 --> 00:21:37,818
- I'm gonna wear my new Prada suit.
- You're a fashion plate and a patriot.
