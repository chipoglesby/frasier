1
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:11,417
A gold-leaf candle snuffer?

2
00:00:12,209 --> 00:00:16,547
My, what a spendthrift
this Charles X was.

3
00:00:16,714 --> 00:00:18,590
Of course I want you to bid
on it for me, Greg.

4
00:00:18,757 --> 00:00:20,884
Now, start waving your paddle.

5
00:00:21,427 --> 00:00:23,387
- Hey.
- Oh, Roz, you got my message.

6
00:00:23,554 --> 00:00:25,055
Yeah, said you had good news.

7
00:00:25,222 --> 00:00:26,265
- Yes.
- What's up?

8
00:00:26,432 --> 00:00:28,225
More importantly, what's down.

9
00:00:28,392 --> 00:00:30,227
Oh, fun. Word play.

10
00:00:30,394 --> 00:00:33,021
No, no, no, the ratings are out
for KACL's first six months

11
00:00:33,188 --> 00:00:34,690
<i>of All Salsa Radio.</i>

12
00:00:35,315 --> 00:00:39,111
- And they were lousy?
- They aspire to lousy.

13
00:00:39,778 --> 00:00:41,488
So they'll be looking
for a new format.

14
00:00:41,697 --> 00:00:45,659
- Better yet, an old format.
- Think they're gonna bring us back?

15
00:00:45,867 --> 00:00:49,204
- That's the scuttlebutt on the street.
- Oh, this is great. Aren't you thrilled?

16
00:00:49,413 --> 00:00:52,833
I'd be shouting it from the rooftops
if I weren't saving my instrument.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,334
- Oh, thank you.
- May I help you?

18
00:00:54,501 --> 00:00:55,877
Non-fat cap.

19
00:00:56,044 --> 00:00:57,295
I haven't seen you before.

20
00:00:57,462 --> 00:01:00,340
- I'm Roz. This is Frasier.
- Colette.

21
00:01:00,507 --> 00:01:02,509
Your mother was a fan
of the great French novelist

22
00:01:02,676 --> 00:01:04,970
and raconteur,
Sidonie Gabrielle Colette.

23
00:01:05,679 --> 00:01:07,305
Okay. Yeah.

24
00:01:08,807 --> 00:01:10,767
Hey, guys, you won't...

25
00:01:13,103 --> 00:01:14,312
Any more like you at home?

26
00:01:14,521 --> 00:01:17,232
- No.
- Good, we'll have privacy.

27
00:01:19,568 --> 00:01:21,862
- Short drip.
- Colette.

28
00:01:22,654 --> 00:01:24,614
- Hey, you guys see these numbers?
- Yes.

29
00:01:24,781 --> 00:01:27,033
<i>- Salsa Radio is in el dumper-acha.
- See?</i>

30
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,287
KACL is gonna be on their knees
begging us to come back to work.

31
00:01:30,453 --> 00:01:31,997
You know that lady
from the temp agency

32
00:01:32,163 --> 00:01:33,707
who's saying I have a bad attitude?

33
00:01:33,915 --> 00:01:35,792
I can't wait to tell
that bean-counting fathead

34
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:37,377
where she can put her time sheet.

35
00:01:37,585 --> 00:01:39,796
I'm quitting on the way home.

36
00:01:39,963 --> 00:01:42,090
What? Did you say something?

37
00:01:42,298 --> 00:01:44,717
No, no, never mind.

38
00:01:45,802 --> 00:01:49,139
I better cancel my lecture next week.
Can't be out of town if I'm gonna work.

39
00:01:49,305 --> 00:01:52,225
- No, no...
- Is everything all right, Colette?

40
00:01:52,392 --> 00:01:55,019
- Oh, I hate this.
- What?

41
00:01:55,228 --> 00:01:57,355
Well, I overhear things.
I'm not trying to.

42
00:01:57,522 --> 00:01:59,649
It just happens
when you're a waitress.

43
00:01:59,857 --> 00:02:01,693
And you overheard something
about KACL?

44
00:02:01,901 --> 00:02:03,528
<i>They're not dropping Salsa.</i>

45
00:02:03,736 --> 00:02:05,655
- What?
- How do you know that?

46
00:02:05,863 --> 00:02:08,324
Well, the station owner
was in this morning, and he said:

47
00:02:08,491 --> 00:02:12,203
"It's my station. I like salsa music,
and I'm sticking with it."

48
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:14,122
But that could mean anything.

49
00:02:15,873 --> 00:02:17,834
I knew I shouldn't have
gotten my hopes up.

50
00:02:18,042 --> 00:02:19,627
This stinks! This is total B.S.!

51
00:02:19,836 --> 00:02:22,380
Oh, what are you so upset
about, Bulldog? You've got a job.

52
00:02:22,547 --> 00:02:23,965
Not anymore.

53
00:02:24,173 --> 00:02:26,801
I got canned last Friday
for saying something on the air.

54
00:02:27,009 --> 00:02:29,178
I was talking with this golfer chick

55
00:02:29,387 --> 00:02:31,889
who said she wants
to enter the Women's Open.

56
00:02:32,056 --> 00:02:34,225
Like I'm supposed
to leave that alone.

57
00:02:40,564 --> 00:02:42,733
I'm starting to think
we're never going back to work.

58
00:02:42,942 --> 00:02:44,902
They can't stay
with a failing format forever.

59
00:02:45,111 --> 00:02:47,697
I guarantee you, in three months,
if the numbers are this bad,

60
00:02:47,863 --> 00:02:49,073
they'll have to make a change.

61
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,200
Three months is an eternity.

62
00:02:51,367 --> 00:02:55,162
My rent's gone up.
The baby stuff cost a fortune.

63
00:02:55,371 --> 00:02:57,081
I stopped buying Alice
those pink headbands

64
00:02:57,248 --> 00:02:59,125
for little girls whose hair
hasn't come in yet.

65
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:01,877
Now, when we go out,
I just call her Howard.

66
00:03:02,545 --> 00:03:05,339
Well, Roz, you know what,
if things have gotten that tight,

67
00:03:05,506 --> 00:03:07,842
let me lend you some money
to tide you over.

68
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:10,302
- Oh, that's very sweet, but I couldn't.
- No, please.

69
00:03:10,511 --> 00:03:12,638
It's not a hardship for me.
I'll be fine for the next three months.

70
00:03:12,846 --> 00:03:15,641
I don't know. I'm not sure I feel
comfortable taking money from you.

71
00:03:15,849 --> 00:03:18,811
Try putting your hair in a bun.
That used to help Lilith.

72
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:21,689
Now, how much can I give you?

73
00:03:21,855 --> 00:03:22,898
Fifteen hundred?

74
00:03:23,065 --> 00:03:26,652
- I mean, I wouldn't ask for so much...
- No, no, none of my business.

75
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:29,196
You can just pay me back
whenever you'd like.

76
00:03:29,363 --> 00:03:32,324
This is your money to do with
as you see fit.

77
00:03:32,533 --> 00:03:34,076
There we are.

78
00:03:34,243 --> 00:03:35,327
Thank you.

79
00:03:35,494 --> 00:03:37,162
Oh, Roz, please,
don't even mention it.

80
00:03:37,371 --> 00:03:39,957
Makes me feel good to share
my good fortune with someone.

81
00:03:40,124 --> 00:03:41,834
I just got a call
from my antique scout.

82
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,419
He's found a gilded candle snuffer
that the Seattle Museum

83
00:03:44,586 --> 00:03:47,881
would pay a pretty penny for
to have in their collection.

84
00:03:49,216 --> 00:03:51,009
I hate her.

85
00:03:57,557 --> 00:03:59,601
Look, I'm sorry, Niles.
I have no idea where it is.

86
00:03:59,768 --> 00:04:02,104
- I'm not even sure I own one.
- Oh, don't be ridiculous.

87
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:04,022
Dad, have you seen
Frasier's frittata pan?

88
00:04:05,232 --> 00:04:08,193
Hi. Marty Crane.
I don't believe we've met.

89
00:04:10,737 --> 00:04:12,614
Dad, what on earth are you doing?

90
00:04:12,781 --> 00:04:14,408
Oh, Eddie's woozy.

91
00:04:14,991 --> 00:04:17,786
There's this vicious blue jay
on the terrace who keeps teasing him.

92
00:04:17,953 --> 00:04:20,747
Then Eddie goes chasing after him
and slams into that glass door.

93
00:04:20,914 --> 00:04:23,250
And this bird just struts around,
big as you please,

94
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:26,336
laughing that snooty bird laugh.

95
00:04:26,962 --> 00:04:29,673
Snooty bird laugh?

96
00:04:30,298 --> 00:04:32,259
Yeah, like that.

97
00:04:35,178 --> 00:04:37,931
I wanna put stickums on the door
so that Eddie remembers it's glass.

98
00:04:38,098 --> 00:04:39,432
Oh, yes, Dad, by all means.

99
00:04:39,599 --> 00:04:42,018
Let's add rainbow decals
to the nose prints

100
00:04:42,185 --> 00:04:44,396
and the bits of fur
that already festoon it.

101
00:04:44,562 --> 00:04:47,399
You're kind of grouchy for somebody
who just got his job back.

102
00:04:47,607 --> 00:04:49,859
Well, maybe that's because I'm not
getting my job back.

103
00:04:50,068 --> 00:04:51,820
What happened?
You said it was a sure thing.

104
00:04:51,986 --> 00:04:53,029
Well, it wasn't.

105
00:04:53,196 --> 00:04:55,824
<i>I spoke with Bebe. She confirmed
that they're keeping Salsa.</i>

106
00:04:56,032 --> 00:04:58,201
- I'm sorry.
- Yes, well, don't despair, Dad.

107
00:04:58,409 --> 00:05:00,912
There are other jobs.
Bebe told me that I'm on the short list

108
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:03,915
for the voice
of Chester "the Yummy Nut" Squirrel.

109
00:05:06,834 --> 00:05:09,420
All right, don't anyone go out
in this weather.

110
00:05:09,587 --> 00:05:12,840
I am so soaked,
my dress is pasted right onto me.

111
00:05:13,049 --> 00:05:16,177
It's a good thing I had this coat
in the trunk.

112
00:05:16,386 --> 00:05:18,888
Yes, that was lucky.
Let me take it for you.

113
00:05:19,055 --> 00:05:22,975
No, it's all right. I'll keep it on
for the moment. Thanks.

114
00:05:23,142 --> 00:05:24,769
Here you are, Dr. Crane.

115
00:05:24,936 --> 00:05:28,523
I stopped off at the Trianon Day Spa
and picked up your papaya exfoliant

116
00:05:28,731 --> 00:05:30,733
<i>- and neck cream pour L' Homme.
- Thanks, Daphne.</i>

117
00:05:30,942 --> 00:05:33,861
I wouldn't have sent you out in this
weather if it weren't an emergency.

118
00:05:34,862 --> 00:05:36,739
Oh, by the way,
I saw Roz down at the spa,

119
00:05:36,906 --> 00:05:39,367
having herself
an all-day beauty treatment.

120
00:05:41,035 --> 00:05:42,161
Now, that's strange.

121
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:43,537
Why?

122
00:05:43,704 --> 00:05:46,123
Well, Roz has been
a little cash-poor lately.

123
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:48,751
In fact, I gave her a loan myself
this morning.

124
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,336
Then she heads down
to the Trianon.

125
00:05:50,503 --> 00:05:52,588
I have half a mind to have a word
with her about it.

126
00:05:52,755 --> 00:05:54,924
Bad idea. If you loaned her
that money, it's hers now.

127
00:05:55,091 --> 00:05:57,093
It's none of your business
what she does with it.

128
00:05:57,301 --> 00:05:59,553
- That's exactly what I told her. Still...
- Trust me.

129
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,390
More friendships have been ruined
because of something like this.

130
00:06:02,598 --> 00:06:04,475
Smartest thing you can do
is never bring it up.

131
00:06:04,683 --> 00:06:05,851
Well, I'm aware of that, Dad.

132
00:06:06,018 --> 00:06:09,021
It's just that she must have gone
straight from the cafe down to the spa.

133
00:06:09,188 --> 00:06:10,481
Don't you think that's odd?

134
00:06:10,689 --> 00:06:14,652
Well, not when you stack it up
against a man who uses neck cream.

135
00:06:20,532 --> 00:06:24,078
Before you mock this product,
you might recall you went to that spa.

136
00:06:24,703 --> 00:06:26,246
- What?
- Don't you remember?

137
00:06:26,413 --> 00:06:29,416
Two years ago, for your birthday,
I gave you that special gift certificate

138
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:32,211
for you and Sherry
to have a day of indulgence.

139
00:06:32,419 --> 00:06:33,504
You told me you used it.

140
00:06:33,712 --> 00:06:35,672
Oh, yeah. Right.

141
00:06:37,633 --> 00:06:40,302
Remind us, Dad,
what treatments did you have?

142
00:06:40,511 --> 00:06:43,222
Oh, we did
the whole shooting match.

143
00:06:43,388 --> 00:06:44,723
First they rubbed us all over,

144
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:48,477
and then they washed us down
with this liniment oil.

145
00:06:48,644 --> 00:06:53,732
And then they hit us
with those hickory sticks.

146
00:06:57,194 --> 00:07:00,614
You've heard us talk about it enough,
you'd be able to bluff better than that.

147
00:07:00,822 --> 00:07:02,658
You'd be surprised
at what I don't listen to.

148
00:07:03,533 --> 00:07:05,369
I'm sorry, Niles.
I hope you're not mad.

149
00:07:05,577 --> 00:07:06,912
Mad? No, I'm delighted.

150
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:08,705
If you still have the certificate,
we can go together.

151
00:07:08,914 --> 00:07:10,165
No, I don't think so.

152
00:07:10,374 --> 00:07:11,625
Oh, please, I need this.

153
00:07:11,792 --> 00:07:13,335
You know,
a spa's just not my speed.

154
00:07:13,502 --> 00:07:16,338
I just keep picturing myself
standing over some drain

155
00:07:16,505 --> 00:07:19,174
being hosed down
like some old circus animal.

156
00:07:19,341 --> 00:07:22,511
But, Dad, I can't afford
this sort of thing for myself anymore.

157
00:07:22,677 --> 00:07:25,722
I'd go without you,
but the certificate's in your name.

158
00:07:26,264 --> 00:07:28,725
- Please?
- Oh, all right.

159
00:07:28,934 --> 00:07:29,976
Oh, great.

160
00:07:30,143 --> 00:07:33,021
I'm gonna call and make a reservation
before you change your mind.

161
00:07:33,772 --> 00:07:35,315
And what are you smirking at?

162
00:07:35,482 --> 00:07:37,776
Oh, I'm just musing
about the timeless moments

163
00:07:37,943 --> 00:07:39,361
that bind a father to son.

164
00:07:39,569 --> 00:07:43,281
A game of catch,
a trip to a little fishing hole,

165
00:07:43,448 --> 00:07:45,700
a shared rainforest mud facial.

166
00:07:51,373 --> 00:07:53,666
Oh, Niles, I thought today
was your spa day.

167
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:56,419
It is. I'm on my way,
and I need it now more than ever.

168
00:07:56,586 --> 00:07:57,796
Last night at the Shangri-La,

169
00:07:57,962 --> 00:08:00,632
- the most scandalous thing happened.
- Now's not the best time.

170
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,551
Oh, sorry, I didn't see you there.
I'll have...

171
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,136
A non-fat cappuccino?

172
00:08:05,762 --> 00:08:06,971
Good guess.

173
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,765
No, I've waited on you before.

174
00:08:08,973 --> 00:08:11,142
Oh, I don't think so.
I'm very observant.

175
00:08:11,351 --> 00:08:13,102
Anyway...

176
00:08:14,103 --> 00:08:17,315
I was invited to a housewarming party
for a new arrival, Stewey.

177
00:08:17,941 --> 00:08:19,984
I hadn't been there two minutes
when I heard a pop.

178
00:08:20,151 --> 00:08:23,321
Looked up to see the '81
Chateau Haut-Brion I brought

179
00:08:23,488 --> 00:08:25,239
being decanted
into a punch bowl of sangria,

180
00:08:25,406 --> 00:08:28,159
canned fruit and erotic ice cubes.

181
00:08:29,369 --> 00:08:31,537
I haven't been so depressed
since Maris started seeing

182
00:08:31,704 --> 00:08:32,914
- What's-His-Name.
- Schenkman.

183
00:08:33,081 --> 00:08:34,624
Thank you.

184
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:38,002
Hey, guys.

185
00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:39,295
- Oh, Roz.
- Hello, Roz.

186
00:08:39,462 --> 00:08:40,963
Shopping really takes it out of you.

187
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:43,883
Really? Stocking up on supplies
for baby Alice?

188
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:48,012
Oh, no. It's mama's turn today.
I'll be back in a minute.

189
00:08:48,512 --> 00:08:51,515
Bidwell's? My God,
isn't that a little pricey?

190
00:08:51,682 --> 00:08:53,643
I'll say. It's Maris' favourite store.

191
00:08:53,851 --> 00:08:55,853
They give points for every dollar
you spend there.

192
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,063
One year, she got enough

193
00:08:57,229 --> 00:08:59,607
to have Tony Bennett
come to our house and sing.

194
00:09:03,819 --> 00:09:07,114
Well, at this rate she's gonna go
through that loan in no time.

195
00:09:07,281 --> 00:09:09,366
I'm just wondering
if I should have a talk with her.

196
00:09:09,575 --> 00:09:11,827
I understand your impulse,
but I'm with Dad on this one.

197
00:09:11,994 --> 00:09:13,621
Questioning her about that money,

198
00:09:13,788 --> 00:09:16,957
- it's just going to lead to trouble.
- I'm not sure I agree.

199
00:09:17,374 --> 00:09:19,251
Of course, the entire point
may be moot anyway.

200
00:09:19,418 --> 00:09:21,629
How do I know there's anything
more extravagant in here

201
00:09:21,795 --> 00:09:24,131
- than calendars and socks?
- Don't even think about it.

202
00:09:24,298 --> 00:09:26,800
You know as well as I do
there is absolutely no justification

203
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:28,302
for going through her bags.

204
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:30,179
You're right, there isn't.

205
00:09:30,804 --> 00:09:32,514
- Now there is.
- Frasier.

206
00:09:32,681 --> 00:09:36,352
Just shut up and keep a lookout.
God, a cashmere sweater.

207
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,145
Bidwell's private labelled perfume.

208
00:09:38,354 --> 00:09:41,065
- Here she comes.
- What, oh, my keys.

209
00:09:41,231 --> 00:09:44,068
That is the last time I wear
the shoes right out of the store.

210
00:09:44,234 --> 00:09:46,820
My feet are killing me.

211
00:09:46,987 --> 00:09:49,615
I should go. I wanna get down
to the spa before Dad.

212
00:09:49,782 --> 00:09:52,284
He may bridle
when the front desk clerk asks him

213
00:09:52,451 --> 00:09:54,912
if he prefers a man or a woman.

214
00:09:58,707 --> 00:10:01,418
Is that the time? I gotta meet Carol
for lunch at La Goloue.

215
00:10:01,627 --> 00:10:02,836
- La Goloue?
- Yeah.

216
00:10:03,003 --> 00:10:05,756
- Roz, before you go, there's...
- Oh, I know.

217
00:10:05,923 --> 00:10:08,926
If I drop your name, they'll give me
better service. I'll call you later.

218
00:10:11,553 --> 00:10:13,388
- Can I get you anything else?
- Yes, a taxi.

219
00:10:13,597 --> 00:10:15,182
I already called.

220
00:10:25,942 --> 00:10:27,235
Oh, damn.

221
00:10:27,444 --> 00:10:29,070
Oh, not to worry, Dr. Crane.

222
00:10:29,237 --> 00:10:31,990
- I'll have that spot cleaned up.
- Thank you, Daphne.

223
00:10:32,199 --> 00:10:35,035
Lock up your daughters.
The men are back from the hunt.

224
00:10:35,202 --> 00:10:38,205
Oh, well, boys,
how was your day at the spa?

225
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:40,707
Fantastic.
You should have seen Dad.

226
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:42,083
I walked by the serenity room

227
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:45,587
just as Olga and Sergei
were giving him a full-body sudsing.

228
00:10:45,795 --> 00:10:49,132
I never felt so clean and so dirty
at the same time.

229
00:10:50,675 --> 00:10:53,136
See you later, Dad. Great day.

230
00:10:53,303 --> 00:10:56,348
- All right, how bad was it?
- Mortifying.

231
00:10:57,182 --> 00:10:59,809
First of all, he refused to go nude,
even in the private rooms.

232
00:10:59,976 --> 00:11:03,271
Well, Niles, don't forget,
Dad is of a different generation.

233
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,149
Wearing socks and underpants
and carrying a wallet into a mudbath

234
00:11:06,316 --> 00:11:07,817
is not a generational issue.

235
00:11:10,987 --> 00:11:13,156
If you ever hear me offer
to take Dad to a spa again,

236
00:11:13,323 --> 00:11:16,117
wash out my mouth with jug wine.

237
00:11:17,368 --> 00:11:19,037
Did you ever get your keys
back from Roz?

238
00:11:19,203 --> 00:11:21,039
No, no. Actually, I had to wait
the entire day

239
00:11:21,205 --> 00:11:23,708
before she found them in her bag.

240
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:25,710
She's on her way over here
right now.

241
00:11:25,877 --> 00:11:28,087
It gives me a chance to talk to her
about her spending.

242
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:30,882
Frasier, why do you insist
on traipsing into that minefield?

243
00:11:31,049 --> 00:11:34,802
Niles, I don't want to talk
to her about it, I have to.

244
00:11:35,011 --> 00:11:36,721
For God's sake,
at the rate she's spending,

245
00:11:36,888 --> 00:11:39,223
she's gonna be out of money
before we're back to work.

246
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:42,977
And frankly, I'm just a bit annoyed
with the way she flaunts it in my face.

247
00:11:43,186 --> 00:11:46,606
Expensive lunches.
Needless extravagances.

248
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:49,650
Frankly, I think the entire thing's
just a bit insensitive, don't you?

249
00:11:49,859 --> 00:11:51,360
Oh, excuse me.

250
00:11:51,527 --> 00:11:56,407
Not to interrupt, but six months ago,
you borrowed $40 from me.

251
00:11:56,616 --> 00:11:58,534
We were at the wine shop,
remember?

252
00:11:58,743 --> 00:12:01,037
You couldn't quite scrape together
enough for a bottle

253
00:12:01,203 --> 00:12:03,914
of your precious
Chateau Mr. Fussy-Pants.

254
00:12:04,957 --> 00:12:06,709
So I lent you the money.

255
00:12:06,876 --> 00:12:09,837
And have I said a peep
about it since? No.

256
00:12:10,046 --> 00:12:13,090
I just sit here,
quietly reusing my tea bags,

257
00:12:13,257 --> 00:12:15,509
while you trundle off
to your private clubs

258
00:12:15,676 --> 00:12:18,137
ordering gourmet this
and imported that.

259
00:12:18,345 --> 00:12:21,140
"Are the cigars Cuban?
Are the tulips Dutch?

260
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:22,433
Oh, good news.

261
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,728
My personal shopper just found
a dozen antique pudding plates."

262
00:12:25,895 --> 00:12:28,856
Who has 12 people
over for pudding?

263
00:12:30,816 --> 00:12:33,110
So you gave poor Roz
a bit of money.

264
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:34,820
It hasn't changed your life, has it,

265
00:12:34,987 --> 00:12:38,782
you sherry-swilling,
foie-gras-munching hypocrite?

266
00:12:44,288 --> 00:12:46,999
Daphne, I did repay you.

267
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,043
What?

268
00:12:49,251 --> 00:12:51,295
I paid for that parking ticket.

269
00:12:51,462 --> 00:12:54,006
Fifty dollars, as I recall.
That means you owe me 10.

270
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,926
Oh, right.
Well, I'm glad you said something.

271
00:12:58,093 --> 00:13:01,054
It's not good
to let these things fester.

272
00:13:04,391 --> 00:13:07,811
Niles, I think I'm having
a weird reaction to that spa stuff.

273
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:10,606
My skin's starting to tingle
and tighten up.

274
00:13:10,814 --> 00:13:13,567
That's the citrus reacting
with your natural oils. It's a good sign.

275
00:13:13,775 --> 00:13:14,985
Well, it doesn't feel so good.

276
00:13:15,152 --> 00:13:18,196
I just scratched my chin
and my eyelid closed.

277
00:13:22,242 --> 00:13:23,618
Oh, that'll be Roz.

278
00:13:23,827 --> 00:13:26,246
Maybe I'll take my leave
before the fur starts to fly.

279
00:13:26,413 --> 00:13:28,457
Oh, Niles, there's not gonna be
any fur flying.

280
00:13:28,623 --> 00:13:31,543
Unless, of course,
she bought one on the way over here.

281
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:32,753
- Hello, Roz.
- Hey, Niles.

282
00:13:32,919 --> 00:13:34,254
- Roz.
- Are you on your way out?

283
00:13:34,421 --> 00:13:35,881
Yes. Good night.

284
00:13:36,506 --> 00:13:38,884
- Well, here are your keys.
- Oh, thank you, Roz.

285
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:41,386
We had to turn the whole cafe
inside out looking for them.

286
00:13:41,553 --> 00:13:44,931
I would've been here a lot sooner,
but I stopped to get you something.

287
00:13:45,098 --> 00:13:47,767
Roz, oh, gosh, you know,
you really shouldn't have.

288
00:13:47,976 --> 00:13:50,103
I wanted to. This is just my way
of saying thank you

289
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:51,354
for how great you've been.

290
00:13:51,521 --> 00:13:53,982
Well, you see,
you really shouldn't have.

291
00:13:54,149 --> 00:13:56,109
I mean, for one thing, it's just...

292
00:13:59,112 --> 00:14:01,740
Gosh, it is lovely, Roz. It's just that...

293
00:14:01,948 --> 00:14:03,867
There's something
I need to talk to you about.

294
00:14:04,034 --> 00:14:06,327
No, that decanter
is not just to say thank you.

295
00:14:06,536 --> 00:14:09,706
It's also to say congratulations.

296
00:14:09,914 --> 00:14:11,624
Station manager
called me half an hour ago.

297
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:13,418
I made him promise
he'd let me tell you.

298
00:14:13,585 --> 00:14:15,753
The board has reconsidered.
They're changing formats.

299
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,214
- They're bringing us back!
- Oh, Roz, that's fantastic!

300
00:14:18,423 --> 00:14:19,966
We start tomorrow.

301
00:14:20,133 --> 00:14:21,175
What's going on?

302
00:14:21,342 --> 00:14:24,721
Good news, Dad, good news.
We got our jobs back at KACL.

303
00:14:24,888 --> 00:14:27,473
Oh, great. Congratulations.

304
00:14:29,434 --> 00:14:31,602
Well, I thought we'd at least
get a smile out of you.

305
00:14:32,228 --> 00:14:34,564
I thought I was smiling.

306
00:14:51,497 --> 00:14:53,624
This is so great!
We're all back together again!

307
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:56,544
Hey, Noel, good to see you.
What have you been up to?

308
00:14:56,752 --> 00:14:59,297
Well, actually, I never left.

309
00:15:01,632 --> 00:15:04,218
<i>Adios, Maria.</i>

310
00:15:04,385 --> 00:15:05,636
Hi, everybody!

311
00:15:05,803 --> 00:15:07,596
Roz!

312
00:15:07,763 --> 00:15:09,598
- Oh, God.
- Isn't this the best?

313
00:15:09,765 --> 00:15:16,188
It's so great to see everyone.
Bulldog and Noel, Frasier, you.

314
00:15:16,689 --> 00:15:19,024
God, I didn't think
I'd ever see this place again.

315
00:15:19,692 --> 00:15:22,695
It's like we're soldiers coming back
from the war.

316
00:15:24,738 --> 00:15:26,198
I'm home!

317
00:15:26,657 --> 00:15:29,243
Well, you know, as much as I'd like
to continue the celebration,

318
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:31,745
in three minutes, we have a show.
Come on, Roz, let's go!

319
00:15:35,124 --> 00:15:38,335
Oh, God. Noel?

320
00:15:38,502 --> 00:15:42,673
Oh, I just wanted to say
I missed you most of all, Roz.

321
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,508
Oh, well, thanks, Noel.
That's so sweet.

322
00:15:44,675 --> 00:15:46,927
Yes, that certainly is sweet, Noel.
Off you go.

323
00:15:47,094 --> 00:15:50,014
Me? Nothing much has changed.

324
00:15:50,222 --> 00:15:51,724
Still living with my mom,

325
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:55,394
still working
on that Klingon-to-English dictionary.

326
00:15:55,602 --> 00:15:57,896
Noel, how do you say goodbye
in Klingon?

327
00:15:58,105 --> 00:16:00,983
Well, it depends.
If you're talking to a superior officer...

328
00:16:01,191 --> 00:16:03,152
- Noel!
- Krish-Krush.

329
00:16:04,153 --> 00:16:05,779
I am so thrilled to be back.

330
00:16:05,946 --> 00:16:07,406
Oh, God, so am I, Roz.

331
00:16:07,573 --> 00:16:09,908
You know what?
I couldn't get a wink of sleep last night.

332
00:16:10,075 --> 00:16:12,870
I put the time to good use. I composed
a speech to open the show.

333
00:16:13,078 --> 00:16:14,121
Oh, that's great.

334
00:16:14,288 --> 00:16:16,123
You know,
as I was falling asleep last night,

335
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:19,751
it occurred to me that you wanted
to talk to me about something.

336
00:16:20,335 --> 00:16:22,587
Right. Right. Oh, well, you know,

337
00:16:22,754 --> 00:16:27,801
I just had a little bone to pick with you.
But it's gone by the wayside now.

338
00:16:27,968 --> 00:16:29,886
- Are you sure?
- Oh, absolutely.

339
00:16:30,053 --> 00:16:31,972
You know how things are
when you're out of work.

340
00:16:32,139 --> 00:16:34,015
You just get a little crazy
about little stuff.

341
00:16:34,182 --> 00:16:36,393
Oh, tell me about it.
I mean, the money stuff alone...

342
00:16:36,601 --> 00:16:38,228
- Well, as a matter of fact...
- What?

343
00:16:38,395 --> 00:16:40,939
No, no, no,
it's just not an issue anymore, Roz.

344
00:16:41,148 --> 00:16:42,858
Now, come on.

345
00:16:43,024 --> 00:16:47,654
Well, all right, it's just that I thought
the way you were spending money

346
00:16:47,821 --> 00:16:49,281
was a little unwise.

347
00:16:49,865 --> 00:16:55,370
You know, spa days,
expensive lunches, Bidwell's perfume.

348
00:16:55,537 --> 00:16:58,832
I just thought, you know,
you were unemployed.

349
00:16:59,332 --> 00:17:02,711
But, you know what?
You're employed now, so there it is.

350
00:17:02,877 --> 00:17:05,588
End of subject.
I won't even bring it up again.

351
00:17:05,755 --> 00:17:08,925
I never told you
I bought that perfume.

352
00:17:10,051 --> 00:17:11,428
Well, I...

353
00:17:11,594 --> 00:17:14,431
You didn't have to.
I can smell it on you.

354
00:17:14,639 --> 00:17:16,015
I'm not wearing any.

355
00:17:16,516 --> 00:17:17,934
You're kidding.

356
00:17:18,101 --> 00:17:20,854
My goodness, is that you? Well, then,
you should sweat into bottles.

357
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,564
We got a show to do.

358
00:17:23,606 --> 00:17:24,941
The only way you could know that

359
00:17:25,108 --> 00:17:28,444
is if you were looking through
my shopping bag... The keys.

360
00:17:28,653 --> 00:17:31,614
- Roz, we really should be setting up.
- I can't believe this.

361
00:17:31,823 --> 00:17:35,285
You were searching through my bags?
What, is this about the loan?

362
00:17:35,451 --> 00:17:36,703
All right, fine.

363
00:17:36,911 --> 00:17:40,623
I gave you $1500 and suddenly,
you were off on a spending spree.

364
00:17:40,832 --> 00:17:42,834
Excuse me,
but weren't you the one that said

365
00:17:43,001 --> 00:17:44,669
I could spend it any way I wanted?

366
00:17:44,877 --> 00:17:46,921
I just thought you were gonna be
more responsible.

367
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:48,840
Oh, so now I'm irresponsible.

368
00:17:49,048 --> 00:17:51,300
No, no, I'm just saying that a woman
in your situation...

369
00:17:51,467 --> 00:17:52,593
What situation?

370
00:17:52,802 --> 00:17:54,178
Oh, I know what this is all about.

371
00:17:54,345 --> 00:17:56,055
- My baby.
- Roz...

372
00:17:56,222 --> 00:17:59,142
- That's what this irresponsible stuff...
- No, that is not what I meant!

373
00:17:59,308 --> 00:18:01,811
Well, listen, obviously,
I am not to be trusted

374
00:18:01,978 --> 00:18:04,689
with your precious money,
so I'm paying you back.

375
00:18:04,897 --> 00:18:09,527
And not that it's any of your business,
but Carol took me out to La Galoue.

376
00:18:09,735 --> 00:18:11,821
And my mother gave me
a day at the spa.

377
00:18:12,029 --> 00:18:14,156
And those shoes were a store credit.

378
00:18:14,323 --> 00:18:16,075
Oh, and I bought the perfume.

379
00:18:16,283 --> 00:18:19,787
Well, that was just for me
because I wanted it.

380
00:18:20,705 --> 00:18:23,708
Roz, I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to say any of those things.

381
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:27,044
- Too late.
- I can't stand to have you mad at me.

382
00:18:27,253 --> 00:18:30,589
Look, let me take you to dinner tonight.
We can discuss it after work, all right?

383
00:18:30,756 --> 00:18:32,007
- You're on.
- Thank you.

384
00:18:32,216 --> 00:18:34,969
No, you're on in five seconds.

385
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:44,061
Good afternoon, Seattle.

386
00:18:44,228 --> 00:18:48,023
This is Dr. Frasier Crane,
and we're back.

387
00:18:49,066 --> 00:18:51,568
But don't worry.
I may have been gone a while,

388
00:18:51,735 --> 00:18:55,698
but I think I can remember
how all these knobs and buttons work.

389
00:18:57,825 --> 00:19:00,577
I see they've moved the cough button.

390
00:19:01,036 --> 00:19:04,331
Well, anyway, I composed
some thoughts last night

391
00:19:04,498 --> 00:19:08,127
about what the show
has meant to me these last years

392
00:19:08,293 --> 00:19:13,298
and, well, I'd like to share it
with you now.

393
00:19:13,507 --> 00:19:15,968
I realised I have a lot
to feel grateful for.

394
00:19:16,134 --> 00:19:20,597
Grateful for my listeners
who trusted me with their problems.

395
00:19:21,431 --> 00:19:26,144
And grateful for the person
whom I most trust.

396
00:19:26,311 --> 00:19:30,732
It's not an exaggeration to say I put my
career in this woman's hands every day

397
00:19:31,692 --> 00:19:33,860
and she never lets me down.

398
00:19:34,361 --> 00:19:40,033
She shoulders many responsibilities
here and in her personal life

399
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:44,704
with a grace and skill that I admire
more than she'll ever know.

400
00:19:46,665 --> 00:19:49,501
I am proud to call her my friend.

401
00:19:49,668 --> 00:19:50,919
My producer, Roz Doyle.

402
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:56,550
Well, now, on to the show.

403
00:19:56,716 --> 00:20:01,096
And if I'm a bit rusty,
I hope you'll forgive me.

404
00:20:02,722 --> 00:20:05,433
After all, to err is human.

405
00:20:07,268 --> 00:20:10,563
- I hope you'll look into your hearts...
- All right, Frasier, you're forgiven.

406
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:12,190
Oh, good. All right.

407
00:20:12,357 --> 00:20:14,567
Well, we've got a quick word
from our sponsor

408
00:20:14,734 --> 00:20:16,820
and then we'll be back
with your calls.

409
00:20:16,986 --> 00:20:18,488
Back after this.

410
00:20:19,531 --> 00:20:20,949
Thanks, Frasier.

411
00:20:21,116 --> 00:20:23,952
- I'm sorry I got so mad.
- Oh, Roz, you had every right to.

412
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,830
How can I think you would squander
the money I gave you that way?

413
00:20:26,996 --> 00:20:29,332
- You'd never be that irresponsible.
- Well, I wouldn't.

414
00:20:29,541 --> 00:20:31,584
If it was on your mind,
I'm glad you brought it up.

415
00:20:31,751 --> 00:20:33,711
I like that we can be honest
with each other.

416
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,171
I like that too.

417
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:37,715
And I'm so touched
that you stayed up all night last night

418
00:20:37,882 --> 00:20:39,509
and wrote all those things about me.

419
00:20:40,093 --> 00:20:41,469
I meant every word.

420
00:20:43,554 --> 00:20:45,765
Hey, Dr. Crane, great speech.

421
00:20:45,932 --> 00:20:48,518
- I loved what you said about Roz.
- Oh, thank you, Noel.

422
00:20:48,726 --> 00:20:51,020
Hey, Bulldog,
can you lend me some money?

423
00:20:51,187 --> 00:20:54,649
- Sure. How much?
- Fifteen hundred. I wrote a bad cheque.

424
00:20:54,857 --> 00:20:57,026
Hey, wait a minute.
There's nothing in here about Roz.

425
00:20:57,193 --> 00:20:58,236
Noel, put that down.

426
00:20:58,402 --> 00:21:00,404
"Like Napoleon's triumphant return
from Elba..."?

427
00:21:00,613 --> 00:21:02,740
Krish-Krush! Krish-Krush!
