1
00:00:08,467 --> 00:00:11,637
<i>So Dr. Crane, I don't see
why I should fix the dumb dress</i>

2
00:00:11,803 --> 00:00:13,722
<i>when my sister
can't even fit into it anymore.</i>

3
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:17,809
Audrey, you borrowed the dress,
you tore it.

4
00:00:17,976 --> 00:00:20,896
As an old Greek haberdasher
once said:

5
00:00:21,063 --> 00:00:24,566
"Euripides, Eumenides."

6
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:27,819
<i>What?</i>

7
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:32,699
Well, it's just a little joke
on the ancient dramatist Euripides

8
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:34,701
and the mythological Furies.

9
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:39,539
Just fix the dress.

10
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:42,292
We'll be back after the weather.

11
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:46,296
Oh, Roz, Noel gave me this
to give to you.

12
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:48,256
- Here.
- Oh, God, Noel.

13
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:51,384
- He's been acting so weird lately.
- Lately?

14
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:53,720
May I remind you this is the man
who's required by law

15
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:57,140
to stay at least 100 yards away
from William Shatner.

16
00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:59,934
No, I bumped into him at Nervosa
about a month ago.

17
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:02,187
There were no other free tables
so we sat together,

18
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:04,939
and since then, he's been acting
like we're some kind of couple.

19
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:07,358
Oh, Roz, I'm sure he knows
you're not interested in him.

20
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:10,195
- "Happy monthiversary."
- Oh, Lord.

21
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:13,323
Oh, we're on.

22
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:17,744
And we're back.
Let's get straight to the phones.

23
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:20,455
<i>- I'm listening.
- Dr. Crane?</i>

24
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:23,166
<i>It's Woody.
I'm in Seattle and I'm a little lost.</i>

25
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:26,961
Well, Woody, in today's fast-paced,
high-pressure society,

26
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:28,463
that's not uncommon.

27
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,673
Just why exactly do you feel lost?

28
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,842
<i>Well, I've been driving around
for about an hour.</i>

29
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:35,219
<i>I can't seem to get out of the airport.</i>

30
00:01:37,513 --> 00:01:39,766
Oh, Woody, Woody.

31
00:01:39,932 --> 00:01:45,188
Oh, well, listeners, this is an old friend
of mine from back in Boston.

32
00:01:45,354 --> 00:01:47,690
Well, how are you doing there,
you old cowpoke?

33
00:01:47,857 --> 00:01:50,860
<i>I'm doing okay, but all this talk
about today's fast-paced,</i>

34
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:53,571
<i>high-pressure world
is starting to get me down.</i>

35
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:56,532
Yes, well, I have just the cure for that.
How about dinner?

36
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:58,451
<i>Sounds great. I'm in town all week.</i>

37
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:01,829
<i>- And I'm free all week. How's tonight?
- Oh, that'd be great.</i>

38
00:02:01,996 --> 00:02:05,249
<i>- So I hear you're on the radio.
- Yes, I am, Woody, and so are you.</i>

39
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:09,378
<i>No, no, no,
I'm still tending bar at Cheers.</i>

40
00:02:10,504 --> 00:02:13,257
<i>Oh, how do these rumours
get started?</i>

41
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:14,884
Believe it or not, listeners,

42
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:18,345
Woody and I are picking up
right where we left off.

43
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,726
- Knock, knock.
- Noel.

44
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:30,149
Oh, I haven't seen that outfit before.
Set your phasers on stunning.

45
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:34,236
Listen, I need to talk to you.
I cannot accept anniversary gifts.

46
00:02:34,403 --> 00:02:36,822
Oh, I know that.
I was just making a little joke.

47
00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:38,449
I know we're just friends.

48
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:40,743
I saw this
and it made me think of you.

49
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,121
Okay, thanks. That's really sweet.

50
00:02:44,288 --> 00:02:46,165
Oh, if you're not gonna open it
for a while,

51
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:47,666
you might wanna move the ribbon.

52
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:50,919
It's blocking the air holes.

53
00:02:55,924 --> 00:02:58,302
Here, I made you some lamb stew.

54
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:00,971
I'm telling you,
there's something weird about Eddie.

55
00:03:01,138 --> 00:03:03,140
Oh, for the love of God,
not this again.

56
00:03:03,307 --> 00:03:05,392
You never should've taken him
to those dog groomers.

57
00:03:05,559 --> 00:03:06,602
I had to bring him.

58
00:03:06,768 --> 00:03:11,106
His toenails were like Howard Hughes'
and his breath smelled like an autopsy.

59
00:03:11,273 --> 00:03:13,275
Well, look at him.
They did something to him.

60
00:03:13,442 --> 00:03:14,985
The sparkle's gone from his eyes.

61
00:03:15,152 --> 00:03:17,988
Yes, and so are
those gooey green bits.

62
00:03:18,613 --> 00:03:22,159
Oh, that's probably Woody. I'll get it.

63
00:03:24,119 --> 00:03:25,579
- Oh, Niles.
- Hello, Frasier.

64
00:03:25,746 --> 00:03:28,123
I know this is impromptu,
but I'm going to an oboe recital

65
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:29,875
and I thought
you might want to join me.

66
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:31,543
Well, I'm sorry, Niles.

67
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:34,796
An old friend of mine came in town.
I invited him to come over this evening.

68
00:03:34,963 --> 00:03:37,841
Well, have him join us. I'm sure
we can get three seats together.

69
00:03:38,008 --> 00:03:40,260
I'm not sure an oboe recital's
quite what I had in mind.

70
00:03:40,427 --> 00:03:42,429
I was thinking of something
a little more raucous.

71
00:03:42,971 --> 00:03:45,640
If it's raucous you're looking for,
we could go and get a nightcap

72
00:03:45,807 --> 00:03:47,392
at the piano bar
at the Mayflower Hotel.

73
00:03:47,559 --> 00:03:49,352
It's Jerome Kern night.

74
00:03:51,187 --> 00:03:55,191
Last time people were shouting out
requests without raising their hands.

75
00:03:56,067 --> 00:03:58,820
You know, Niles,
I'm afraid we'll have to pass.

76
00:03:58,987 --> 00:04:00,989
You see, my friend Woody
is an old bar chum

77
00:04:01,156 --> 00:04:02,824
from back at Cheers...

78
00:04:03,241 --> 00:04:05,618
What I had in mind
was really more of a beer-swilling,

79
00:04:05,785 --> 00:04:07,954
back-slapping kind of night,
if you know what I mean.

80
00:04:08,121 --> 00:04:09,664
You're welcome to join us if you like.

81
00:04:09,831 --> 00:04:11,374
- Sounds interesting.
- Well, now...

82
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:14,586
- Woody!
- Hey, Dr. Crane!

83
00:04:14,752 --> 00:04:17,839
- Good to see you.
- You look great.

84
00:04:18,006 --> 00:04:19,799
Oh, thanks, thanks. You too.

85
00:04:19,966 --> 00:04:21,885
- This place is awesome.
- Thank you.

86
00:04:22,051 --> 00:04:25,638
I'm not surprised you need all
these roommates to help you pay for it.

87
00:04:26,347 --> 00:04:29,017
Well, they're not really roommates,
Woody. They're...

88
00:04:29,475 --> 00:04:31,769
They're more like boarders actually.

89
00:04:31,936 --> 00:04:34,981
- No, that's my father, Martin.
- Oh, hi.

90
00:04:35,148 --> 00:04:36,983
- Woody Boyd.
- I remember hearing about you.

91
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:39,235
- You were a policeman, right?
- That's right.

92
00:04:39,402 --> 00:04:40,903
That's my brother right there, Niles.

93
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:43,406
- He's a psychiatrist too.
- Hello.

94
00:04:43,573 --> 00:04:46,325
And this is Daphne Moon,
my father's home healthcare worker.

95
00:04:46,492 --> 00:04:49,162
- It's nice to meet you.
- Oh, hi. I like your accent.

96
00:04:49,328 --> 00:04:51,914
- You're from England, right?
- Manchester.

97
00:04:52,081 --> 00:04:54,834
Darn. I'm usually pretty good at that.

98
00:04:56,586 --> 00:05:00,882
- Oh, hey, who's this little guy?
- I'm not sure I even know anymore.

99
00:05:01,048 --> 00:05:03,884
Oh, my dad's getting the same way.

100
00:05:04,927 --> 00:05:07,763
- So, Woody, can I get you a beer?
- That's funny, huh?

101
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:09,849
You know, all those years
I was waiting on you,

102
00:05:10,016 --> 00:05:11,559
and now you're getting me a beer.

103
00:05:11,726 --> 00:05:13,602
Yes, life's like that sometimes,
isn't it?

104
00:05:13,769 --> 00:05:16,313
Daphne, get us a couple of beers,
will you?

105
00:05:17,815 --> 00:05:20,693
So, what brings you to Seattle, huh?

106
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:23,279
- Oh, my cousin's getting married.
- Really?

107
00:05:23,446 --> 00:05:24,864
Which is the cousin? Bride or groom?

108
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:27,199
Well, actually, both are.

109
00:05:30,286 --> 00:05:32,204
I assume they're kissing cousins.

110
00:05:32,371 --> 00:05:35,082
They're doing a lot more than that.

111
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:38,419
That's why they have to get married.

112
00:05:40,963 --> 00:05:42,923
So is Kelly with you?

113
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:47,511
No, no, she's visiting her mom
with the kids, but she sends her love.

114
00:05:48,053 --> 00:05:51,223
- And how's the old gang, huh?
- Oh, well, they haven't changed much.

115
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:53,809
Sam's doing great, Carla's terrific.

116
00:05:53,976 --> 00:05:56,186
Oh, you know,
we almost had a wedding.

117
00:05:56,353 --> 00:05:59,982
Mr. Clavin got himself one of those
Eastern European mail-order brides.

118
00:06:00,149 --> 00:06:04,194
But they lived together for a couple
of days and decided to call it off.

119
00:06:04,361 --> 00:06:06,488
Oh, gosh. I'm so sorry for Cliff.

120
00:06:06,655 --> 00:06:09,074
Yeah, she said she was homesick.

121
00:06:09,241 --> 00:06:12,411
That Bosnia
must be a beautiful place.

122
00:06:15,289 --> 00:06:17,916
- Here we are.
- Oh, thank you, Daphne.

123
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:20,794
That's one for you, one for you,

124
00:06:20,961 --> 00:06:23,380
and one for me.

125
00:06:23,547 --> 00:06:26,049
Well, Woody, I thought that tonight
we'd just maybe stay in.

126
00:06:26,216 --> 00:06:28,385
- You know, order some pizza.
- Sounds good by me.

127
00:06:28,552 --> 00:06:30,804
Okay, great. I'll just call the place
around the corner.

128
00:06:30,971 --> 00:06:33,932
- Niles, you're gonna join us?
- Well, why not.

129
00:06:34,099 --> 00:06:35,475
It'll be fun to drink some beer

130
00:06:35,642 --> 00:06:38,186
and have some pizza
with a couple of rapscallions.

131
00:06:38,353 --> 00:06:42,691
If you don't mind, could we make that
half rapscallions, half pepperoni?

132
00:06:49,656 --> 00:06:51,908
That wasn't
the best prank we played.

133
00:06:52,075 --> 00:06:53,868
You remember that time
with Mr. Clavin?

134
00:06:54,035 --> 00:06:56,788
Oh, yes, and the ferret.

135
00:06:59,499 --> 00:07:01,459
He was about to go on his route,

136
00:07:01,626 --> 00:07:04,879
and we shoved that angry ferret
into his mailbag.

137
00:07:05,046 --> 00:07:08,550
Oh, my. Exactly how
do you make a ferret angry?

138
00:07:08,717 --> 00:07:12,220
Well, for starters,
you shove him into a mailbag.

139
00:07:12,762 --> 00:07:14,055
God, that was funny.

140
00:07:14,222 --> 00:07:16,975
Do you remember
the expression on his face?

141
00:07:17,142 --> 00:07:22,188
Oh, no, I never saw his expression.
I was too busy looking at Mr. Clavin.

142
00:07:29,028 --> 00:07:30,613
Woody,
let me get you another cold one.

143
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,615
- Oh, thanks.
- Oh, gosh, I tell you,

144
00:07:32,782 --> 00:07:34,701
this has just been the best evening.

145
00:07:34,867 --> 00:07:35,994
My God,

146
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,038
it's like reliving all my old days
at Cheers, only without Lilith.

147
00:07:39,205 --> 00:07:42,875
Boy, that's a trip to Bountiful,
let me tell you.

148
00:07:43,418 --> 00:07:45,795
These guys are really going
through the beers, aren't they?

149
00:07:45,962 --> 00:07:48,464
Oh, yes. If this keeps up,
you may have to fish out

150
00:07:48,631 --> 00:07:51,217
that emergency can
you keep in the toilet tank.

151
00:07:51,676 --> 00:07:53,302
Here you are, Woods.

152
00:07:53,845 --> 00:07:54,971
Oh, well, you know what?

153
00:07:55,138 --> 00:07:57,223
On second thought,
I think I'm gonna pass.

154
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:59,350
I'm feeling a little bit jet-lagged.

155
00:07:59,517 --> 00:08:02,019
- All right, you wanna call it a night?
- I probably should.

156
00:08:02,186 --> 00:08:05,398
But this was so much fun.
I'd really like to do it again.

157
00:08:05,565 --> 00:08:07,233
All right.
Well, how about lunch tomorrow?

158
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,360
- Oh, yeah, that sounds great.
- Okay.

159
00:08:09,527 --> 00:08:12,530
- Hey, goodbye, y'all. Nice to meet you.
- Yeah, you too. Come back.

160
00:08:12,697 --> 00:08:15,366
You know, Woody, there's
a new gourmet Mexican restaurant

161
00:08:15,533 --> 00:08:17,243
down near your hotel I'd love to try.

162
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:20,371
<i>It's called Dos Burros.
It sounds muy delicioso.</i>

163
00:08:20,538 --> 00:08:22,540
- I didn't know you speak Spanish.
- Oh, well...

164
00:08:22,707 --> 00:08:25,626
<i>I know that dos means "two."
What's burro mean?</i>

165
00:08:25,793 --> 00:08:28,170
Oh, same as in English. Jackass.

166
00:08:28,337 --> 00:08:30,714
Sorry, just asking.

167
00:08:38,305 --> 00:08:40,266
- Hey, guys, how was lunch?
- Oh, great.

168
00:08:40,432 --> 00:08:43,185
If we told one old story,
we told a hundred.

169
00:08:43,852 --> 00:08:46,522
- Hey, how are you doing, little guy?
- His name's Eddie.

170
00:08:46,689 --> 00:08:49,608
Oh, Eddie. Good for you, Mr. Crane.

171
00:08:49,775 --> 00:08:52,611
They have good days
and they have bad days.

172
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:57,783
Woody, here's that Seattle guidebook
I was telling you about. Right here.

173
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:00,411
- Oh, thanks.
- Get a load of that, huh?

174
00:09:02,162 --> 00:09:06,750
Wow, look at that view.
You can see the whole city.

175
00:09:06,917 --> 00:09:09,169
When you turn around
it's even better.

176
00:09:12,047 --> 00:09:14,508
Oh, yeah, you're right. This is better.

177
00:09:14,675 --> 00:09:16,468
No, no, no.
Look and see there...

178
00:09:18,387 --> 00:09:22,432
- Hey, yeah, you mind if I go out there?
- No, no, you go ahead.

179
00:09:22,599 --> 00:09:23,684
Hey, you remember that time

180
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:26,520
we went out on the balcony
at Melville's and threw pudding?

181
00:09:27,229 --> 00:09:31,191
I don't think I ever laughed harder
in my entire life.

182
00:09:33,568 --> 00:09:37,030
- Put a bullet in my head.
- What's going on?

183
00:09:37,197 --> 00:09:41,118
God, I have absolutely
nothing in common with this man

184
00:09:41,284 --> 00:09:43,495
except things
that happened 10 years ago.

185
00:09:43,662 --> 00:09:45,247
I thought you had
a fun time last night.

186
00:09:45,413 --> 00:09:47,666
Well, yes. We had exactly
the same time this afternoon,

187
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:49,000
and it wasn't nearly as fun.

188
00:09:49,167 --> 00:09:51,795
The same stories
and variations thereof.

189
00:09:51,962 --> 00:09:55,215
Being forced to laugh over and over.

190
00:09:55,382 --> 00:09:57,592
I swear, if I never get
another shoulder noogie

191
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:01,263
- I will die a happy man.
- Oh, don't feel bad.

192
00:10:01,429 --> 00:10:03,598
You've been a good friend,
you showed him a nice time,

193
00:10:03,765 --> 00:10:07,185
and now all that's left is for you
to go in there and tell him goodbye.

194
00:10:07,352 --> 00:10:08,770
Yes, I guess when all this is over

195
00:10:08,937 --> 00:10:11,606
I will have learned
a very valuable lesson.

196
00:10:12,065 --> 00:10:14,818
Sometimes, you can have too much
of a good thing.

197
00:10:14,984 --> 00:10:17,278
Got to know when to say when.

198
00:10:17,445 --> 00:10:19,072
The past is just that, the past.

199
00:10:19,239 --> 00:10:22,325
You can never go home again.
Less is more.

200
00:10:22,492 --> 00:10:24,953
Wish you would have started
with that last one.

201
00:10:28,748 --> 00:10:31,042
Well, Woods, huh?

202
00:10:31,209 --> 00:10:32,835
It's been great seeing you.

203
00:10:33,378 --> 00:10:35,463
- Oh, yeah, hey...
- Come on, give me...

204
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:38,049
Give me a good hug, huh?

205
00:10:38,967 --> 00:10:41,886
You gotta promise me you'll give
my love to everybody back at the bar.

206
00:10:42,053 --> 00:10:43,429
- Oh, I will.
- Okay.

207
00:10:43,596 --> 00:10:45,306
And give that beautiful wife of yours

208
00:10:45,473 --> 00:10:47,475
and those two kids a big kiss
from Uncle Frasier.

209
00:10:47,642 --> 00:10:50,645
- You got it.
- And don't be a stranger, okay?

210
00:10:50,812 --> 00:10:52,980
No, I won't. I won't.

211
00:10:54,899 --> 00:10:58,402
So where are we going
for dinner tonight?

212
00:11:04,617 --> 00:11:07,411
- Niles.
- Oh, Frasier.

213
00:11:07,578 --> 00:11:11,165
Odd to see you without Woody in tow.
Is he off teasing ferrets?

214
00:11:11,332 --> 00:11:14,627
Niles, listen, I've been having
such a great time with Woody,

215
00:11:14,794 --> 00:11:16,879
I was hoping,
maybe tonight you'd like to join us.

216
00:11:17,046 --> 00:11:18,631
- We plan to go out...
- You can save it.

217
00:11:18,798 --> 00:11:21,133
Dad brought me up to speed
on your reunion of the damned.

218
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,843
- Oh, God.
- I would love to help.

219
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:26,263
- I'm sorry, you're on your own.
- No, no, please. Really, I'm desperate.

220
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:28,766
Do you have any idea
how difficult it is to feign interest

221
00:11:28,933 --> 00:11:30,810
in the same old stories
over and over again?

222
00:11:30,976 --> 00:11:32,561
And you call yourself a psychiatrist?

223
00:11:32,728 --> 00:11:34,563
You wouldn't last a week
in private practice.

224
00:11:35,439 --> 00:11:37,358
Speaking of which,
my 6:00 is waiting.

225
00:11:37,525 --> 00:11:39,360
- Triple espresso to go.
- Thank you.

226
00:11:39,527 --> 00:11:42,238
Niles, please. Please, I need you.

227
00:11:42,404 --> 00:11:44,990
It's gonna be
an excruciating journey into...

228
00:11:45,157 --> 00:11:47,243
Oh, God... Roz.

229
00:11:47,409 --> 00:11:49,828
Say, you know, are you up
for a night on the town?

230
00:11:49,995 --> 00:11:52,581
This wouldn't be the invitation
Niles just blew off, would it?

231
00:11:52,748 --> 00:11:54,917
Oh, all right. Here. Please.

232
00:11:55,084 --> 00:11:57,169
My old friend Woody's
dragging me out again tonight.

233
00:11:57,336 --> 00:11:59,004
I could really use a buffer.

234
00:11:59,171 --> 00:12:02,341
He's taking me
to some God-awful karaoke bar.

235
00:12:02,508 --> 00:12:03,676
- Are you gonna sing?
- No.

236
00:12:03,842 --> 00:12:05,511
- Okay, I'll go.
- Really? You will?

237
00:12:05,677 --> 00:12:07,763
I have a babysitter tonight.
My plans fell through.

238
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:11,809
- Karaoke might be fun.
- Karaoke, tonight? Oh, I'd love to.

239
00:12:11,975 --> 00:12:14,144
Well, Gil,
I'm not sure you'd enjoy this...

240
00:12:14,311 --> 00:12:17,105
Nonsense. If we go to the one on Pike,
I keep a locker there

241
00:12:17,272 --> 00:12:20,067
where I store my own microphone
and show jackets.

242
00:12:21,693 --> 00:12:23,987
- Hey, guys. Hi, Roz.
- Oh, hi, Noel.

243
00:12:24,154 --> 00:12:26,698
I see you're at our table.

244
00:12:27,115 --> 00:12:28,492
"Our table"?

245
00:12:28,659 --> 00:12:30,369
Oh, is there
an office romance brewing?

246
00:12:30,535 --> 00:12:33,789
No, Gil, we're just friends.
Right, Noel?

247
00:12:33,956 --> 00:12:36,083
So far.

248
00:12:36,249 --> 00:12:38,210
Well, who knows
what the night has in store.

249
00:12:38,377 --> 00:12:40,420
We're all going for karaoke.
Why don't you join us?

250
00:12:40,587 --> 00:12:43,006
- Count me in.
- Is that my beeper?

251
00:12:43,173 --> 00:12:44,800
- I didn't hear anything.
- It's the babysitter.

252
00:12:44,966 --> 00:12:46,635
She calls in an emergency.
Gotta go, bye.

253
00:12:46,802 --> 00:12:47,844
- Roz...
- Taxi!

254
00:12:48,011 --> 00:12:51,473
- Roz, wait!
- Roz, wait!

255
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:55,018
Well, looks like it's just us boys.

256
00:13:03,985 --> 00:13:07,155
- Oh, that was beautiful.
- Yeah.

257
00:13:07,322 --> 00:13:08,990
You know, Niles,
that was the first movie

258
00:13:09,157 --> 00:13:10,450
I ever took your mother to see.

259
00:13:10,617 --> 00:13:13,703
I deliberately picked a tear-jerker
so I'd be there to comfort her.

260
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:17,082
At the first sniffle
I was on her like an octopus.

261
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:18,708
You men.

262
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:21,211
You always find a way
to make us more vulnerable

263
00:13:21,378 --> 00:13:23,755
to your clumsy advances.

264
00:13:23,922 --> 00:13:27,300
Oh, that wine
went straight to my head.

265
00:13:27,467 --> 00:13:30,011
Let's just kill off the bottle, shall we?

266
00:13:34,015 --> 00:13:35,517
Hey, Fras.

267
00:13:36,518 --> 00:13:39,103
- Turn off the music.
- Oh, well, we were just...

268
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:42,774
Dad,
I never wanna hear music again.

269
00:13:44,192 --> 00:13:48,279
Oh, I take it you had a whiz-bang time
at the karaoke bar?

270
00:13:49,155 --> 00:13:50,907
For starters,

271
00:13:51,366 --> 00:13:54,577
Woody sang
"What Kind of Fool Am I?"

272
00:13:55,745 --> 00:13:59,457
Which quickly turned
into an audience-participation number.

273
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:06,297
Then Gil and Noel
did a charming duet

274
00:14:06,464 --> 00:14:09,383
of "Anything You Can Do
I Can Do Better."

275
00:14:09,884 --> 00:14:11,928
They were both wrong.

276
00:14:16,557 --> 00:14:19,560
I guess the highlight of the evening
was when Gil,

277
00:14:19,727 --> 00:14:22,855
after one too many Kir Royales,

278
00:14:23,814 --> 00:14:27,818
performed a haunting rendition
of "I Feel Pretty,"

279
00:14:30,738 --> 00:14:32,990
during the latter verses of which
Noel joined him

280
00:14:33,157 --> 00:14:37,912
on the apron of the stage
and translated into Klingon.

281
00:14:43,709 --> 00:14:46,170
Well, I think I'm just
gonna go off to bed

282
00:14:46,337 --> 00:14:49,381
so I can get up bright and early for my
harbour cruise with Woody tomorrow.

283
00:14:49,548 --> 00:14:50,883
What? You're seeing him again?

284
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:53,219
Why don't you just tell the guy
you're busy for once?

285
00:14:53,385 --> 00:14:55,930
But, Dad, he knows that I'm not.

286
00:14:56,764 --> 00:14:59,892
Besides, I'd hate to hurt his feelings.

287
00:15:00,059 --> 00:15:02,186
I'd hate to have him think
that I've outgrown him.

288
00:15:02,353 --> 00:15:04,396
- But you have.
- Well, that's the problem.

289
00:15:04,563 --> 00:15:06,774
I've moved on to bigger
and better things in my life.

290
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:07,983
He's still pouring drinks

291
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:11,612
back at the same bar
he's been at for the last 15 years.

292
00:15:11,779 --> 00:15:15,074
- Don't you think that's kind of sad?
- If I were you, I'd just lie to him.

293
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,284
Tell him you have to work
or you met a pretty girl.

294
00:15:17,451 --> 00:15:19,578
<i>Who's that pretty girl
In the mirror there?</i>

295
00:15:19,745 --> 00:15:23,165
<i>What mirror, where?
Who could that attractive girl be?</i>

296
00:15:23,332 --> 00:15:25,667
<i>Which, what, where, whom? Who?</i>

297
00:15:25,834 --> 00:15:27,336
<i>- Daphne. Daphne.
- Who?</i>

298
00:15:27,503 --> 00:15:28,879
Daphne!

299
00:15:30,422 --> 00:15:31,506
Bedtime.

300
00:15:31,673 --> 00:15:33,800
I used to be
with the Light Opera Works.

301
00:15:33,967 --> 00:15:36,261
Yes, fine.
And I used to be a fan dancer.

302
00:15:36,428 --> 00:15:38,263
Get out. Go to bed.

303
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:41,683
She seems a little wobbly.

304
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:43,727
- Perhaps I should...
- Niles.

305
00:15:50,692 --> 00:15:53,070
Oh, surprise. Guess who?

306
00:15:53,236 --> 00:15:56,281
Dear God. I just left him.

307
00:15:56,865 --> 00:16:01,077
What moonlit, berry-picking expedition
does he have planned for me now?

308
00:16:02,704 --> 00:16:05,207
I can't take this anymore.
All right, all right, fine.

309
00:16:05,373 --> 00:16:08,043
I'm just gonna have to lie to him.

310
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,921
- Woody.
- Hey, Dr. Crane.

311
00:16:11,087 --> 00:16:12,130
- Hey, everybody.
- Hi.

312
00:16:12,297 --> 00:16:16,259
Listen, l... When I got back to my hotel,
I called Kelly to say good night

313
00:16:16,426 --> 00:16:20,138
and turns out our little girl
has an ear infection,

314
00:16:20,305 --> 00:16:22,182
so I'm taking the redeye right now,

315
00:16:22,349 --> 00:16:24,225
and my cab is waiting for me
downstairs.

316
00:16:24,392 --> 00:16:27,062
Oh, well, Woody,
I guess this means goodbye then.

317
00:16:27,228 --> 00:16:30,440
- Yeah, I'm afraid so.
- Well, all right. Give me a hug.

318
00:16:30,607 --> 00:16:32,817
Remember to give my love
to the folks back at Cheers.

319
00:16:32,984 --> 00:16:34,027
- Oh, will do.
- Okay.

320
00:16:34,194 --> 00:16:36,404
I hope that little girl of yours
gets better real soon.

321
00:16:36,571 --> 00:16:38,448
Thank you.
It was great spending time with you.

322
00:16:38,615 --> 00:16:40,450
- It was great seeing you too, Woody.
- Yeah.

323
00:16:40,617 --> 00:16:43,411
- It's a shame we have to cut it short.
- It sure is. Goodbye.

324
00:16:43,578 --> 00:16:45,747
- Have a good trip.
- Take care. Bye-bye.

325
00:16:45,914 --> 00:16:47,874
Good night, Woods.

326
00:16:50,793 --> 00:16:54,964
God bless the virus
that invaded that little girl's ear canal.

327
00:17:03,306 --> 00:17:05,850
- Congratulations. I'll be off.
- Oh, no, no, Niles.

328
00:17:06,017 --> 00:17:08,019
Tell you what.
To celebrate my new-found freedom,

329
00:17:08,186 --> 00:17:10,354
we go over to that little cantina
I mentioned earlier,

330
00:17:10,521 --> 00:17:11,773
and I'll buy you a late supper.

331
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:15,234
- We'll have a margarita.
- Oh, well, thank you, Frasier.

332
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:18,279
And after that, we'll go by
that pricey new cigar club. It's my treat.

333
00:17:18,863 --> 00:17:20,615
Well, hey, big spender.

334
00:17:23,659 --> 00:17:25,286
Is everything all right?

335
00:17:26,662 --> 00:17:30,958
The last time I heard that phrase,
Gil was belting it out

336
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:34,545
while sitting on the lap
of a Japanese businessman.

337
00:17:36,297 --> 00:17:38,299
Let's get that margarita.

338
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:44,346
- Thank you.
- I think you're gonna like this place.

339
00:17:44,513 --> 00:17:46,682
Well, I do already. N.M.B.

340
00:17:46,849 --> 00:17:49,935
- N.M. B?
- No mariachi band.

341
00:17:53,355 --> 00:17:55,232
Dear God. Quick.
Hide your face with your menu.

342
00:17:55,399 --> 00:17:57,651
- What...?
- Woody's over there.

343
00:17:57,818 --> 00:17:59,278
If he sees us, he'll know I lied.

344
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:02,156
- When did you lie?
- I told him I was going out of town.

345
00:18:02,323 --> 00:18:04,783
No, you didn't. He told you
he was going out of town.

346
00:18:05,868 --> 00:18:07,286
That's right.

347
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:10,664
He lied. He should be hiding. Woody.

348
00:18:10,831 --> 00:18:12,541
Woody.

349
00:18:17,838 --> 00:18:21,383
For God's sake. Stay here.

350
00:18:28,348 --> 00:18:30,434
Woody, come out of there, please.

351
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:37,024
I don't understand this.

352
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:39,818
It means, "I don't speak English."

353
00:18:40,485 --> 00:18:42,446
Would you just come out here?

354
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:47,242
Woody, what is going on?

355
00:18:47,409 --> 00:18:49,745
I can't even look at you,
I'm so ashamed.

356
00:18:49,911 --> 00:18:52,664
- I lied to you, Dr. Crane.
- Why did you do that?

357
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:56,626
Well, I guess I didn't want you to know
it was me in the bathroom.

358
00:18:58,336 --> 00:19:00,130
No, Woody.

359
00:19:00,297 --> 00:19:04,259
Earlier this evening, you told me
that you were going back to Boston.

360
00:19:04,426 --> 00:19:09,181
Oh, well, I feel terrible saying this,

361
00:19:09,347 --> 00:19:13,226
but I just couldn't face another day
of us hanging out together.

362
00:19:13,393 --> 00:19:15,478
What, you weren't enjoying
our time together?

363
00:19:15,645 --> 00:19:18,982
Oh, you know,
I had a great time that first night,

364
00:19:19,149 --> 00:19:22,402
but after that, I don't know,
you were still having a good time,

365
00:19:22,569 --> 00:19:26,823
but it was less and less fun for me.

366
00:19:30,118 --> 00:19:32,245
It's just too funny.

367
00:19:32,662 --> 00:19:36,207
See, you're still having a good time
and I'm miserable.

368
00:19:36,374 --> 00:19:38,084
Why didn't you say something?

369
00:19:38,251 --> 00:19:41,713
Well, I don't know.
I didn't wanna hurt your feelings.

370
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,798
To tell you the truth, I was...

371
00:19:43,965 --> 00:19:45,967
I felt kind of bad for you.

372
00:19:46,467 --> 00:19:47,927
You felt bad for me?

373
00:19:48,094 --> 00:19:50,263
Well, no offence,
but look at your life.

374
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:54,267
You live with your dad,
you hang out with your brother.

375
00:19:56,144 --> 00:19:58,771
You have no plans and...

376
00:19:58,938 --> 00:20:01,149
Let's face it,
those karaoke friends of yours,

377
00:20:01,316 --> 00:20:04,152
I wouldn't want to be stranded
on a desert island with them.

378
00:20:04,819 --> 00:20:10,324
Oh, well, maybe that English guy.
He was a good entertainer.

379
00:20:10,491 --> 00:20:13,578
Really, Woody,
there's nothing to worry about.

380
00:20:13,745 --> 00:20:16,289
I know my life may seem
rather dreary to you,

381
00:20:16,456 --> 00:20:18,916
but it's really quite enjoyable.

382
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:21,669
In fact, it's even a lot of fun.

383
00:20:22,128 --> 00:20:25,006
I love my life now.
Honestly. You know what?

384
00:20:25,173 --> 00:20:27,717
I wouldn't trade my years at Cheers
for anything,

385
00:20:27,884 --> 00:20:31,846
but I am very happy with my life
the way it is today.

386
00:20:32,263 --> 00:20:34,432
- You mean it?
- Yes.

387
00:20:34,599 --> 00:20:36,684
That's what makes this conversation
so ironic.

388
00:20:36,851 --> 00:20:40,521
You see, you see my life as some sort
of middle-age compromise

389
00:20:41,188 --> 00:20:44,525
and, well, just the other day
I was thinking about your life.

390
00:20:44,692 --> 00:20:48,362
- And all I could think was...
- What?

391
00:20:51,574 --> 00:20:53,075
How lucky you are.

392
00:20:53,576 --> 00:20:57,037
You see, you found where you belong,
and you've made your home there.

393
00:20:57,204 --> 00:21:00,791
I guess for some of us
it just takes longer than others.

394
00:21:02,418 --> 00:21:04,420
Well, I just stopped in for a beer...

395
00:21:04,587 --> 00:21:07,047
Well, Niles will be on the phone
for a couple more minutes.

396
00:21:07,214 --> 00:21:09,133
Why don't we just have
one last drink together?

397
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,509
- Well, that'd be nice.
- Okay.

398
00:21:10,676 --> 00:21:13,095
Barkeep,
couple of beers here, please.

399
00:21:14,179 --> 00:21:17,099
You know, I meant what I said

400
00:21:17,266 --> 00:21:21,895
about I had a great time
hanging out with you that first night.

401
00:21:22,062 --> 00:21:23,939
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

402
00:21:24,106 --> 00:21:27,443
Maybe we could do it again
in five or 10 years.

403
00:21:27,609 --> 00:21:30,946
Absolutely. Ten years it is.

404
00:21:32,239 --> 00:21:33,949
Cheers.

405
00:21:34,783 --> 00:21:36,535
Cheers.
