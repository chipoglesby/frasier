1
00:00:10,018 --> 00:00:11,645
François, it's Niles Crane.

2
00:00:11,812 --> 00:00:14,439
You delivered some champagne earlier
for Valentine's Day.

3
00:00:14,606 --> 00:00:18,360
Well, you brought over the '88,
and I asked for the '85.

4
00:00:18,568 --> 00:00:20,237
Yes, my date
will know the difference.

5
00:00:20,445 --> 00:00:22,822
She happens to be the president
of our wine club.

6
00:00:23,031 --> 00:00:24,574
Thank you. Thank you.

7
00:00:24,741 --> 00:00:26,952
Yes. Remember, I won't be at home.

8
00:00:27,202 --> 00:00:28,912
No, I'm not entertaining
at the Shangri-la.

9
00:00:29,079 --> 00:00:31,289
My brother was kind enough
to let me use his apartment.

10
00:00:31,456 --> 00:00:34,668
Well, what could I do?
I threw a blanket over it.

11
00:00:35,043 --> 00:00:39,089
All right, now hurry, please,
this woman is very particular.

12
00:00:40,757 --> 00:00:42,550
Lucky for you, she loves dogs.

13
00:02:15,225 --> 00:02:16,477
Oh, yeah.

14
00:02:35,537 --> 00:02:37,289
There we go.

15
00:02:44,087 --> 00:02:46,131
All right, all right.

16
00:03:02,105 --> 00:03:03,732
Hey!

17
00:03:11,907 --> 00:03:12,908
Hey, hey, hey!

18
00:03:32,886 --> 00:03:35,555
Oh, dear, oh.

19
00:07:16,816 --> 00:07:19,027
<i>- Hello?
- Roz, it's Frasier.</i>

20
00:07:19,235 --> 00:07:20,236
<i>Listen, I need your help.</i>

21
00:07:20,445 --> 00:07:22,321
Well, I don't have much time.
I'm on my way out.

22
00:07:22,572 --> 00:07:25,450
Just answer me this.
How do you know if you're on a date?

23
00:07:25,658 --> 00:07:26,993
<i>- Are you alone?
- Yes.</i>

24
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,619
Then you're not on a date.

25
00:07:30,121 --> 00:07:31,122
That's very funny.

26
00:07:31,372 --> 00:07:33,583
<i>Listen, I'm in a restaurant waiting
for Cassandra Stone,</i>

27
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:34,959
<i>our new publicity director.</i>

28
00:07:35,209 --> 00:07:37,920
She asked me out for dinner
this evening, and I was very flattered.

29
00:07:38,087 --> 00:07:39,338
I think she's a terrific woman.

30
00:07:39,547 --> 00:07:41,007
It's just, I'm starting to wonder

31
00:07:41,174 --> 00:07:45,219
if this is a business dinner
or more of a romantic date.

32
00:07:45,428 --> 00:07:47,388
You're going out to dinner
on Valentine's Day.

33
00:07:47,555 --> 00:07:48,723
It sounds like a date to me.

34
00:07:48,973 --> 00:07:51,851
Yes, well, she didn't know it was
Valentine's Day until I reminded her,

35
00:07:52,018 --> 00:07:54,478
and she did say she wanted
to go over a new ad campaign.

36
00:07:54,687 --> 00:07:55,688
Oh, come on.

37
00:07:55,896 --> 00:07:58,274
Every time I see you two,
she's got her hands all over you.

38
00:07:58,482 --> 00:07:59,984
She has her hands
all over everybody.

39
00:08:00,151 --> 00:08:01,652
- She's a big flirt.
- That's true.

40
00:08:01,861 --> 00:08:03,738
She flirted with me
the first time I met her

41
00:08:03,904 --> 00:08:06,282
until I took off
my baseball cap and parka.

42
00:08:07,491 --> 00:08:09,160
<i>Why don't you just ask her
if it's a date?</i>

43
00:08:09,326 --> 00:08:12,746
Oh, Roz, I can't do that.
What if the answer is no?

44
00:08:12,955 --> 00:08:15,875
<i>For God's sakes, it'll be awkward
all through dinner, awkward at work.</i>

45
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:18,460
Imagine how embarrassing
if it gets around the station.

46
00:08:18,711 --> 00:08:20,462
I guess you're gonna have
to play it by ear.

47
00:08:20,629 --> 00:08:23,007
You'll know what she has in mind
by the way she's dressed,

48
00:08:23,215 --> 00:08:25,134
how she acts, how she treats you.

49
00:08:25,342 --> 00:08:26,844
Yeah, yeah, I guess you're right.

50
00:08:27,511 --> 00:08:29,972
- Oh, there's my date.
- Who are you going out with tonight?

51
00:08:30,222 --> 00:08:32,266
Oh, Bob, you know,
the tax accountant.

52
00:08:32,474 --> 00:08:34,310
Isn't he the one who drones on
so incessantly,

53
00:08:34,476 --> 00:08:35,644
you call him "The Cricket?"

54
00:08:35,853 --> 00:08:37,354
No, I call him "The Cricket"

55
00:08:37,521 --> 00:08:40,858
because he rubs his hands together
really fast during sex.

56
00:08:41,066 --> 00:08:43,694
<i>- Bye.
- Goodbye.</i>

57
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,494
- Cassandra.
- Sorry to keep you waiting.

58
00:08:52,703 --> 00:08:55,956
Oh, well, that's all right. I was just
wondering if you'd changed your mind.

59
00:08:56,123 --> 00:08:58,333
What, and pass up dinner
with the sexiest man in radio?

60
00:09:00,294 --> 00:09:02,254
Oh, well.

61
00:09:03,338 --> 00:09:06,216
I, you know... It's just so...
Our plans were so last-minute,

62
00:09:06,383 --> 00:09:08,593
I thought, you know,
maybe I'd misunderstood.

63
00:09:10,512 --> 00:09:14,516
My, things have certainly
been clarified, haven't they?

64
00:09:15,559 --> 00:09:17,519
- Will you excuse me for a second?
- Of course.

65
00:09:18,145 --> 00:09:20,272
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Excuse me.

66
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,524
See that woman over there
by the coat check?

67
00:09:22,732 --> 00:09:24,568
- Yes.
- Yes, she's my dinner companion.

68
00:09:24,734 --> 00:09:27,362
See, and things have taken a turn
toward the romantic.

69
00:09:27,571 --> 00:09:31,158
See, now, I want to make her feel
as special as possible.

70
00:09:31,366 --> 00:09:34,160
Then you should have offered
to check her coat.

71
00:09:34,369 --> 00:09:35,871
Yes, thank you very much. All right.

72
00:09:36,037 --> 00:09:38,039
Just play something romantic
when she comes back.

73
00:09:38,206 --> 00:09:41,459
Miss Cassandra,
so nice to see you again.

74
00:09:41,668 --> 00:09:42,836
You too, Mario.

75
00:09:43,044 --> 00:09:46,298
And how's the sexiest maitre d'
in Seattle?

76
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:55,640
Sorry again for keeping you waiting.
I got sucked in at this cocktail party.

77
00:09:55,807 --> 00:09:57,350
Oh, you were at a cocktail party.

78
00:09:57,517 --> 00:09:59,727
Some benefit thing.
It was very fancy.

79
00:09:59,936 --> 00:10:01,980
Obviously. Why else
would I show up wearing this?

80
00:10:02,188 --> 00:10:04,566
Why else indeed?

81
00:10:08,903 --> 00:10:11,447
Oh, they have
the best wine list here.

82
00:10:12,407 --> 00:10:14,117
Do you feel like sharing a bottle?

83
00:10:14,325 --> 00:10:15,577
If you like.

84
00:10:15,827 --> 00:10:18,121
Good thing I took a cab here.
I'm a real lightweight.

85
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:20,623
Then again,
I'm sure a gentleman like you

86
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:23,626
wouldn't mind escorting me back
to my room after dinner, will you?

87
00:10:24,168 --> 00:10:26,295
Why, I think that could be arranged.

88
00:10:30,258 --> 00:10:32,802
- I love the food here.
- What do you recommend?

89
00:10:33,052 --> 00:10:35,680
I'll start with the anchovies
and red peppers,

90
00:10:35,847 --> 00:10:39,267
and then the garlic chicken
with scallions.

91
00:10:45,022 --> 00:10:46,941
Are you in the mood for oysters?

92
00:10:48,985 --> 00:10:51,279
Actually, I'm not sure.

93
00:10:55,741 --> 00:10:58,577
Well, here we are.

94
00:10:58,744 --> 00:11:00,788
Your hotel room.

95
00:11:00,955 --> 00:11:03,165
Last stop.

96
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,960
Oh, come on in.

97
00:11:07,169 --> 00:11:09,922
- Oh, thank you so much for this coat.
- Of course.

98
00:11:10,131 --> 00:11:12,800
Oh, God, I can't believe
we got caught in that rain storm.

99
00:11:12,967 --> 00:11:15,970
- I'm freezing.
- Yes, me too.

100
00:11:16,178 --> 00:11:18,139
I know something we can do
to warm up really fast.

101
00:11:18,347 --> 00:11:20,099
Yes, all we have to do is...

102
00:11:20,307 --> 00:11:22,059
- Have a brandy.
- Yes! Let's have a brandy.

103
00:11:22,226 --> 00:11:24,103
- The mini-bar's right over there.
- Oh, great.

104
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:26,480
I'll be right out.

105
00:11:33,445 --> 00:11:35,572
<i>- Hello?
- Roz, it's Frasier.</i>

106
00:11:35,781 --> 00:11:37,908
<i>- Where are you?
- I'm in Cassandra's hotel room.</i>

107
00:11:38,158 --> 00:11:41,036
She invited me up here after dinner.
I'm just not sure what that means.

108
00:11:41,203 --> 00:11:42,204
<i>What it means?</i>

109
00:11:42,413 --> 00:11:45,666
<i>It means even a blind pig
finds an acorn once in a while.</i>

110
00:11:48,419 --> 00:11:50,295
I'm still getting a lot
of conflicting signals.

111
00:11:50,462 --> 00:11:53,006
Maybe she just wants me up here
to talk about business.

112
00:11:53,298 --> 00:11:56,969
I just wish I could get one clear,
unambiguous sign.

113
00:11:57,845 --> 00:12:00,973
Oh, I just had to get out
of that dress.

114
00:12:01,139 --> 00:12:04,226
Here's your brandy.

115
00:12:11,733 --> 00:12:13,527
I'll just go dry my hair.

116
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,197
Roz, I'm back.

117
00:12:19,366 --> 00:12:21,993
Okay, she ditched her dress,
and she's hitting the sauce.

118
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,080
What do you need,
runway lights on the mattress?

119
00:12:27,249 --> 00:12:29,918
Roz, it's not as clear-cut
as it seems.

120
00:12:30,085 --> 00:12:32,921
<i>Look, Frasier,
she is way out on a limb here.</i>

121
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:35,674
You know how rejected she's gonna
feel if you don't make a move?

122
00:12:35,882 --> 00:12:38,093
<i>- You're gonna blow it forever.
- Right.</i>

123
00:12:38,301 --> 00:12:40,512
You know what?
I'll take off my jacket.

124
00:12:40,762 --> 00:12:42,722
Yeah, go get them, cowboy.

125
00:12:44,307 --> 00:12:45,392
Frasier?

126
00:12:46,017 --> 00:12:47,686
Are you making yourself
comfortable?

127
00:12:48,728 --> 00:12:49,896
Yes.

128
00:12:50,146 --> 00:12:51,815
If it's okay,
I still have a few questions

129
00:12:51,982 --> 00:12:54,985
about the ad campaign
I'd like to ask you.

130
00:12:55,151 --> 00:12:57,987
Well, that's why I'm here.

131
00:12:58,154 --> 00:13:02,534
Or if you prefer, we could just talk
about it over breakfast tomorrow.

132
00:13:05,203 --> 00:13:06,788
Breakfast, you say?

133
00:13:06,996 --> 00:13:08,498
I hope I wasn't
being presumptuous.

134
00:13:08,665 --> 00:13:10,542
We will be having breakfast
together, won't we?

135
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:12,377
Absolutely.

136
00:13:12,544 --> 00:13:14,754
Great.
So who else is gonna be there?

137
00:13:14,921 --> 00:13:16,172
Where?

138
00:13:16,339 --> 00:13:17,340
At the breakfast meeting.

139
00:13:17,549 --> 00:13:19,592
The one for the sponsors here
at the hotel tomorrow.

140
00:13:19,801 --> 00:13:21,761
You just said you were going, right?

141
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:24,889
The meeting. Of course.

142
00:13:26,724 --> 00:13:28,601
Frasier.

143
00:13:29,352 --> 00:13:30,937
What are you doing?

144
00:13:31,396 --> 00:13:33,523
Well, I...

145
00:13:34,107 --> 00:13:36,484
I thought you said you were
gonna make yourself comfortable.

146
00:13:37,735 --> 00:13:38,986
Why don't you check the closet?

147
00:13:39,153 --> 00:13:41,364
I'm sure you'll find something
in there you can slip on.

148
00:13:41,572 --> 00:13:44,492
- All right.
- I'm just gonna take my lenses out.

149
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,914
You know, I'm really glad
I asked you to dinner.

150
00:13:50,164 --> 00:13:51,999
Gosh, so am I.

151
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:53,251
You may not believe this,

152
00:13:53,417 --> 00:13:55,628
but I almost chickened out
at the last minute.

153
00:13:55,878 --> 00:13:58,631
It just goes to show,
it's always better to take the risk.

154
00:13:58,839 --> 00:13:59,840
Yes.

155
00:14:00,049 --> 00:14:03,386
I mean, so you say no. I'm an adult.
What's a little embarrassment?

156
00:14:03,594 --> 00:14:05,388
I couldn't agree more.

157
00:14:06,055 --> 00:14:08,516
Did you find the slippers?

158
00:14:13,521 --> 00:14:14,522
What?

159
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:16,941
In the closet. You stepped in
that puddle after dinner.

160
00:14:17,108 --> 00:14:20,945
I figured you might want to get out
of those wet shoes and socks.

161
00:14:21,112 --> 00:14:22,113
I mean, it's up to you.

162
00:14:22,321 --> 00:14:24,782
I know some people feel funny
about taking their shoes off

163
00:14:24,949 --> 00:14:27,409
in someone else's room.

164
00:14:28,744 --> 00:14:31,956
My gosh, it's really starting
to come down out there.

165
00:14:32,122 --> 00:14:34,333
You know what I'm thinking?

166
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,544
No, I truly don't.

167
00:14:40,297 --> 00:14:43,258
Well, it doesn't make much sense
for you to drive home in this weather,

168
00:14:43,425 --> 00:14:46,345
especially since you are coming back
for breakfast anyway.

169
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:49,348
Why don't you just
stay over tonight?

170
00:14:49,515 --> 00:14:51,642
All right.

171
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:55,729
When you say "stay over,"
you mean, of course...

172
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:58,065
Stay here.

173
00:15:00,067 --> 00:15:03,987
Here? Right. Splendid.

174
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:08,951
- Oh, my God!
- What? I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

175
00:15:09,535 --> 00:15:12,371
I just can't believe it's so late.

176
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:14,581
What are you sorry for?

177
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:18,210
Oh, just for keeping you up so late.

178
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:21,088
Oh, that's all right.

179
00:15:22,047 --> 00:15:23,548
Aren't you coming to bed?

180
00:15:23,965 --> 00:15:26,343
Oh, yes. Coming to bed, yes.

181
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:30,389
Coming to this bed.

182
00:15:31,556 --> 00:15:33,308
Well, would you mind
turning the lights out?

183
00:15:33,475 --> 00:15:35,936
Oh, no, no, no. Not at all.

184
00:15:44,027 --> 00:15:46,821
You know, Cassandra, I know
this may sound like a silly question

185
00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:53,745
seeing as how we're in bed together,
and nearly naked.

186
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,666
I've just been wondering,

187
00:15:57,832 --> 00:16:05,215
is this a romantic date
or a business thing?

188
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:15,683
Cassandra?

189
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:18,019
Cassandra.

190
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:26,319
Roz, it's Frasier.

191
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:36,204
You know, Daph,
I'm really impressed with you.

192
00:16:36,371 --> 00:16:38,164
A lot of people get all insecure

193
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:40,625
if they don't have a date
on Valentine's Day, but not you.

194
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,377
Oh, heavens, no.

195
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:44,712
If you think about it,
it's just a silly holiday

196
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:47,048
they made up to sell
more flowers and candy.

197
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:48,257
Right.

198
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:51,010
Well, you take a look at the menu,
and I'll check your coat.

199
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:52,678
Oh, there's no need for that.

200
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,472
So, what looks good to you?

201
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,349
The coat check girl.
Give me your coat.

202
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,020
Happy Valentine's Day.

203
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:02,980
- Welcome to Russano's.
- Thank you.

204
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:04,982
The waiter will be by
to take your drink order

205
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:06,317
when your husband gets back.

206
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:09,612
Oh, he's not my husband.
I don't have a...

207
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:12,448
...husband.

208
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:18,788
Wow, I wish there was something else
I could check.

209
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:21,248
Besides my blood pressure.

210
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:23,834
Well, I know what I'm in the mood for.

211
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:27,463
A nice big steak. How about you?

212
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,257
What happened?

213
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:34,261
Well, look around you.
Nothing but couples in love.

214
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:36,430
That's never gonna be me.

215
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:38,974
I'm just gonna wind up
a dried-up old maid

216
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:43,729
in a quilted bath robe
with a smelly, deaf cat on my lap.

217
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:45,940
I thought you said
you're okay with that.

218
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:48,233
- What?
- All right, Daph. Come on, now.

219
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:50,986
Now, don't get upset. Here,
have a drink of water or something.

220
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:53,614
- Oh, I'm sorry about this.
- That's okay.

221
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:55,616
I don't know what came over me.

222
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:59,286
I haven't cried like this since,
well, New Year's Eve.

223
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:01,622
Oh, jeez, come on, Daph.

224
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:05,417
You're, you know,
you're gonna find someone.

225
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:07,127
- You think so?
- Well, sure.

226
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:12,257
Yeah, you're...
You have a lot of very great qualities.

227
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:15,928
Thank you.
I'm so sorry about this.

228
00:18:16,094 --> 00:18:19,097
I know it makes you uncomfortable
to talk about personal things.

229
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:21,725
Yeah, well, that's all right.
So you ready to order?

230
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:23,852
Oh, yeah.

231
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:28,523
What kind of qualities?

232
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:34,196
Well, you know, you're smart
and nice-Iooking and fun to be with.

233
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:36,364
So you gonna go
with the soup or salad?

234
00:18:36,531 --> 00:18:39,326
- You really think I'm nice-Iooking?
- Well, sure, yeah.

235
00:18:40,368 --> 00:18:43,038
Where's that guy with the bread?

236
00:18:43,663 --> 00:18:44,915
That is so sweet of you.

237
00:18:45,123 --> 00:18:48,376
Well, don't mention it.
Let's just have a nice, happy evening.

238
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:51,796
Of course. I'm fine now.

239
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:58,053
- Nice-Iooking how?
- Oh, jeez.

240
00:18:58,219 --> 00:19:01,306
- Oh, never mind.
- Oh, no, it's all right.

241
00:19:01,514 --> 00:19:06,061
Well, you know,
you're pretty and tall.

242
00:19:06,269 --> 00:19:09,773
And you take good care of your hair.

243
00:19:09,981 --> 00:19:12,108
You know, you're attractive.
What do you want from me?

244
00:19:12,358 --> 00:19:15,278
Well, I'm sorry, but I don't hear
this sort of thing very much lately.

245
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:17,906
Well, you're just in a slump,
that's all.

246
00:19:18,114 --> 00:19:20,825
You ask me, you're a great catch.

247
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:23,870
It's not my place to say so, miss,
but I think your father's right.

248
00:19:24,078 --> 00:19:26,289
You're a very attractive woman.

249
00:19:29,959 --> 00:19:33,212
Well, how about that?

250
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:36,716
- That's a nice little ego boost.
- Yeah.

251
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:42,180
Oh, I feel so silly all of a sudden,
getting upset out of nowhere like that.

252
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:44,015
Well, I feel better now.

253
00:19:44,182 --> 00:19:47,935
- Ready to share a nice big steak?
- Yeah, fine, whatever.

254
00:19:49,437 --> 00:19:50,688
What's wrong with you?

255
00:19:50,938 --> 00:19:52,356
Why did he assume
I was your father?

256
00:19:52,523 --> 00:19:54,984
I mean, a lot of guys my age
go out with women like you.

257
00:19:55,151 --> 00:19:56,152
What's he trying to say,

258
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,488
that I can never attract
someone young and pretty?

259
00:19:58,696 --> 00:20:00,031
Well, thank you, Mr. Crane.

260
00:20:00,239 --> 00:20:03,409
- Does this all have to be about you?
- Oh, for heaven's sakes.

261
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:06,829
Well, you're a very attractive man
with lots of wonderful qualities.

262
00:20:06,996 --> 00:20:10,833
Yeah, yeah, I know.
All right, let's order.

263
00:20:15,546 --> 00:20:17,423
Like what?

264
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:19,634
Oh, come on, now.

265
00:20:19,842 --> 00:20:23,429
You're very charming,
and you have a good sense of humour.

266
00:20:23,637 --> 00:20:25,765
And you've got lovely eyes.

267
00:20:25,973 --> 00:20:28,267
But most of all,
you're good company.

268
00:20:28,434 --> 00:20:30,144
I enjoy living with you.

269
00:20:30,644 --> 00:20:32,938
Well, thank you, Daphne.
I like living with you too.

270
00:20:33,189 --> 00:20:35,065
Thank you.

271
00:20:38,611 --> 00:20:39,987
So why do you like living with me?

272
00:20:40,154 --> 00:20:43,157
Oh, for God's sake!
Didn't we just agree to cut this out?

273
00:20:43,324 --> 00:20:47,661
Oh, all right, all right.
You're wonderful. I'm wonderful.

274
00:20:47,828 --> 00:20:50,122
You know, it's funny
when I think about the two of us.

275
00:20:50,331 --> 00:20:52,166
I mean, sure,
we have our little fights,

276
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:55,836
but for the most part,
we get along so well together.

277
00:20:56,003 --> 00:20:59,506
And when I think about
how I enjoy looking after you

278
00:20:59,757 --> 00:21:03,427
and how you always seem to miss me
when I've been gone for too long,

279
00:21:03,677 --> 00:21:05,763
well, it's sort of like you're my...

280
00:21:06,805 --> 00:21:07,890
What?

281
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:11,185
- No, it might sound funny to say it.
- Now, come on.

282
00:21:11,393 --> 00:21:13,395
That's all right. You can say it.

283
00:21:14,813 --> 00:21:16,398
All right.

284
00:21:16,565 --> 00:21:19,443
Well, it's sort of like you're my pet.

285
00:21:21,236 --> 00:21:23,238
What?

286
00:21:23,447 --> 00:21:25,908
Well, in a good sense.
Like you and Eddie.

287
00:21:26,158 --> 00:21:28,285
What are you talking about?
Are you calling me a dog?

288
00:21:28,493 --> 00:21:29,995
- It's an analogy!
- I can't believe it.

289
00:21:30,203 --> 00:21:33,206
I take you out to buy you a nice meal,
and you call me a dog!

290
00:21:33,415 --> 00:21:35,542
- I give you a bath.
- I wish I ate as well as Eddie,

291
00:21:35,751 --> 00:21:38,628
I'll tell you that,
instead of the slop you give me.
