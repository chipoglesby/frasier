1
00:00:09,092 --> 00:00:11,011
Don't walk away from me
when I'm yelling at you!

2
00:00:11,178 --> 00:00:12,679
I'll walk away from you if I want to.

3
00:00:12,888 --> 00:00:14,806
- It's my house!
- Yes, don't I know it.

4
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:16,350
You have no respect for my stuff.

5
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:18,727
<i>Well, if you had labelled
the cassette Rodeo Bloopers,</i>

6
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:20,103
I wouldn't have taped over it,

7
00:00:20,312 --> 00:00:22,147
I would've thrown it away.

8
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:39,247
Dad, I'm sorry.

9
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:40,790
Forget it, Fras.

10
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:43,335
It's just I've been so tense lately,
being out of work.

11
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:45,795
I know, it's not easy us both
being home so much.

12
00:00:45,962 --> 00:00:48,798
Yeah. Well, I suppose that during
this little in-between-jobs period,

13
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:52,135
we should just try to be extra careful
to not get on each other's nerves.

14
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:53,553
All right, I'll do that.

15
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,639
Good.

16
00:00:56,348 --> 00:00:57,474
Dad, what's this?

17
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,018
Oh, a call came in for you.

18
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:02,187
Rebecca Wendell.

19
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:04,439
- Oh, my God.
- Isn't she that model you been after?

20
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:07,275
Not just a model, Dad.
A lingerie model.

21
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:10,028
I met her at the symphony.
Wow, this is amazing.

22
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:12,447
- When did this come in?
- About an hour ago.

23
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:14,782
- I was here an hour ago.
- Yeah, you were in the tub.

24
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:17,327
That didn't stop you yesterday
when you came in to ask me

25
00:01:17,493 --> 00:01:20,079
if a peach smelled funny.
For God's sakes, Dad.

26
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:21,831
I'd like to know why this is my fault.

27
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:25,001
I put it there in the special-message
bowl that we're all supposed to use.

28
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:26,628
Damn, it's her machine.

29
00:01:26,794 --> 00:01:28,963
Thanks. I've been looking forward
to this for months.

30
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:31,132
Now you know how I feel
about the rodeo tape.

31
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:33,343
For God's sake, the two things
have no comparison!

32
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:35,136
Hello, Rebecca.

33
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:37,305
It's Frasier. Sorry I missed you.

34
00:01:37,513 --> 00:01:41,517
Please try again. Bye.

35
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:44,937
I hope you're happy.
I have to sit here all afternoon

36
00:01:45,104 --> 00:01:46,397
waiting for the phone to ring.

37
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:49,525
- As opposed to what you normally do?
- Oh, that's rich coming from you.

38
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:53,446
A man who's spent the last five years
welded to his aptly named La-Z-Boy.

39
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:56,240
Well, I'm not so lazy
that I can't get the hell out of here.

40
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:58,826
- I haven't finished talking yet.
- I'm finished listening.

41
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:01,913
- As usual, running from the problem.
- Not the problem, the yammering.

42
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,373
You wanna tape over something?
Try your mouth!

43
00:02:09,545 --> 00:02:11,422
- Hey, Martin.
- Oh, hi, Roz.

44
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:13,591
Decaf latte to go, please.
So is Frasier here?

45
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:15,634
I hope not.

46
00:02:15,843 --> 00:02:18,262
Oh, he's just been such a pill lately.

47
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:20,765
You know, it's tough for people
when they're out of work.

48
00:02:20,973 --> 00:02:23,350
They just get a little tense
and irritable.

49
00:02:23,559 --> 00:02:26,145
To go, I said to go.

50
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:29,773
Maybe you need to take a little break
from each other.

51
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,734
Have you ever thought about,
I don't know,

52
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:33,694
staying with Niles for a while?

53
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:36,196
Out of the frying pan,
into the fire, huh?

54
00:02:36,697 --> 00:02:40,159
Think about it. Niles' place is so huge,
and he's at work all the time.

55
00:02:40,367 --> 00:02:43,537
Yeah, it's true.
And Maris is out of the picture now.

56
00:02:43,996 --> 00:02:45,873
You know what?
I just thought of something.

57
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,624
For a while there,
your daughters-in-law

58
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:49,626
were Maris and Lilith.

59
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:54,048
- Whoa, happy Thanksgiving.
- Yeah.

60
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:55,507
Hey, Niles.

61
00:02:55,674 --> 00:02:56,925
- Oh, hello.
- Niles.

62
00:02:57,092 --> 00:02:58,969
I'm not interrupting
anything personal, am I?

63
00:02:59,136 --> 00:03:03,140
Yeah, Niles, we just eloped.
I'm your new mom.

64
00:03:03,432 --> 00:03:05,684
Well, I'll be a son of a bitch.

65
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:10,439
Latte, please.

66
00:03:10,647 --> 00:03:12,524
Martin, why don't you tell Niles
your new idea?

67
00:03:12,691 --> 00:03:14,067
Well, actually, it was Roz's idea,

68
00:03:14,234 --> 00:03:16,403
but I think she might have something,
you know.

69
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:18,739
Frasier and I have been
kind of butting heads lately.

70
00:03:18,947 --> 00:03:22,075
Well, Frasier has been very difficult.
I don't know how you live with him.

71
00:03:22,284 --> 00:03:23,327
Well, that was Roz's idea.

72
00:03:23,493 --> 00:03:26,204
She suggested that I move in
with you for a while.

73
00:03:27,956 --> 00:03:30,459
- Did she?
- Yeah.

74
00:03:30,667 --> 00:03:33,003
Yeah, you know, we talked about it
when I first got shot

75
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:34,880
but, of course,
Maris was the problem.

76
00:03:35,046 --> 00:03:39,009
So I guess the big question now is,
do you still want me?

77
00:03:39,217 --> 00:03:40,427
Oh, don't be silly.

78
00:03:40,594 --> 00:03:44,639
I want you just as much now
as I wanted you then.

79
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,683
Well, I guess this is gonna work out.

80
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:48,602
- Thanks, Roz.
- Don't mention it.

81
00:03:48,768 --> 00:03:51,479
The look on Niles' face
is thanks enough.

82
00:03:54,608 --> 00:03:56,651
Now, Dad, you're sure
it won't bother you

83
00:03:56,818 --> 00:03:59,070
to live so far from the park
and McGinty's...

84
00:03:59,279 --> 00:04:02,657
Oh, no, no, not at all. There's a bus
that stops right in front of your place.

85
00:04:02,824 --> 00:04:05,535
- Eddie and I don't mind taking the bus.
- Eddie?

86
00:04:07,162 --> 00:04:08,997
Eddie.

87
00:04:09,164 --> 00:04:12,500
You know, I just remembered, Dad,
my building doesn't allow dogs.

88
00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:14,878
Well, that's it then,
because I'm not leaving Eddie.

89
00:04:15,086 --> 00:04:17,172
Oh, of all the horrendous luck.

90
00:04:17,338 --> 00:04:19,174
Oh, well, thanks anyway.

91
00:04:19,382 --> 00:04:21,593
I guess I'll just look for a little place.

92
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:22,844
Can't be too small though,

93
00:04:23,011 --> 00:04:24,804
because I gotta have a bedroom
for Daphne.

94
00:04:38,401 --> 00:04:40,903
You know, Dad,
about that no-dog rule,

95
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:43,656
I could speak to Clarice,
the head of our co-op board.

96
00:04:43,865 --> 00:04:45,992
Oh, really?
You think they'd make an exception?

97
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,703
Well, let's just say she's bent
quite a few rules in her day

98
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:51,789
and if she doesn't want her husband
to find out, she'll bend this one.

99
00:04:51,998 --> 00:04:54,125
- That's great.
- Yes, well, then it's settled.

100
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:57,670
Daphne can move in straight away.
You and Daphne.

101
00:04:57,879 --> 00:04:59,338
Great.

102
00:05:03,217 --> 00:05:05,303
- Oh, hello, Niles.
- Frasier, where's Daphne?

103
00:05:05,511 --> 00:05:07,305
I think at the market.

104
00:05:07,471 --> 00:05:08,556
Hello, Dad.

105
00:05:08,764 --> 00:05:10,016
Frasier, about this afternoon...

106
00:05:10,224 --> 00:05:12,393
Look, let's just drop it, all right?

107
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,978
All's well that ends well,

108
00:05:14,603 --> 00:05:16,856
and this afternoon ended
very well indeed.

109
00:05:17,064 --> 00:05:19,150
Your underwear model called?

110
00:05:19,316 --> 00:05:20,526
Just after you left, actually.

111
00:05:20,693 --> 00:05:23,362
We spoke for about an hour,
and we're having dinner together

112
00:05:23,529 --> 00:05:24,697
on Saturday night.

113
00:05:24,905 --> 00:05:26,907
Well, that's great.
I hope everything works out.

114
00:05:27,116 --> 00:05:28,534
Actually, Dad, on that score,

115
00:05:28,701 --> 00:05:31,036
you could make yourself scarce
that night.

116
00:05:31,203 --> 00:05:34,039
Well, actually, I'm moving in
with Niles for a couple of months.

117
00:05:34,248 --> 00:05:36,709
Well, have some confidence
in me, Dad.

118
00:05:36,876 --> 00:05:38,878
It won't take me that long.

119
00:05:40,921 --> 00:05:43,799
No, no. No, no, I mean it.
Niles and I have been talking about it.

120
00:05:43,966 --> 00:05:46,176
Yes, and I think it's a fine idea.

121
00:05:46,385 --> 00:05:47,886
I know I've been out of sorts lately,

122
00:05:48,053 --> 00:05:49,638
I hope I haven't made
you feel unwanted.

123
00:05:49,805 --> 00:05:51,432
No, no, it's nothing like that.

124
00:05:51,598 --> 00:05:54,852
Listen, I've been living under your roof
for five years now.

125
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,854
You've earned a little time
to yourself.

126
00:05:57,062 --> 00:05:58,897
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

127
00:05:59,106 --> 00:06:02,109
- Maybe you should sleep on it tonight.
- Frasier, Frasier, please. Look.

128
00:06:02,317 --> 00:06:04,820
You've had a chance to get closer
to Dad these past few years,

129
00:06:04,987 --> 00:06:07,030
and I wouldn't mind having
that same chance myself.

130
00:06:07,197 --> 00:06:09,408
Frankly, I'm a bit jealous.

131
00:06:13,537 --> 00:06:16,331
Well, I am sorry, Niles.

132
00:06:16,498 --> 00:06:18,542
I guess I haven't been seeing this
from your angle.

133
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,461
- Hello, all.
- Hello, Daphne.

134
00:06:21,628 --> 00:06:24,381
Quite a little angle it is too.

135
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:27,551
Let me ask you something. How would
you feel about moving in with Niles?

136
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,011
- You serious?
- Yes.

137
00:06:29,219 --> 00:06:34,141
- Just me?
- Yes. No, no, and Dad.

138
00:06:35,392 --> 00:06:37,144
Just till Frasier goes back to work.

139
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:39,312
It's been a little crowded
around here.

140
00:06:39,521 --> 00:06:41,148
Well, I won't argue with that.

141
00:06:41,314 --> 00:06:43,233
You know,
Dr. Crane has quite a few stairs.

142
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,735
- Are you sure you can manage them?
- Oh, sure.

143
00:06:45,902 --> 00:06:48,405
Nobody knows better than you
how well my hip's getting.

144
00:06:48,613 --> 00:06:52,284
Well, what are we waiting for?
Here, let's get you packed.

145
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:53,994
Wait a minute.

146
00:06:55,328 --> 00:06:58,623
I was hired
as Mr. Crane's physical therapist,

147
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:01,209
and if he can make it up and down
that staircase of yours,

148
00:07:01,376 --> 00:07:04,129
he really doesn't need
full-time care anymore.

149
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:11,261
This is hard for me to say,
but maybe it's time I moved on.

150
00:07:13,805 --> 00:07:16,391
We all knew this day
would come sooner or later.

151
00:07:16,599 --> 00:07:18,476
What about my exercises?

152
00:07:18,893 --> 00:07:21,104
You'll do fine on your own.

153
00:07:21,271 --> 00:07:24,983
Believe me, it's not that I want to go.
I'm very fond of you all.

154
00:07:25,191 --> 00:07:26,818
I'm not like a psychiatrist,

155
00:07:26,985 --> 00:07:29,487
who works with someone
for years and years

156
00:07:29,654 --> 00:07:32,907
and it doesn't matter
if they ever get better.

157
00:07:38,246 --> 00:07:41,374
My work here is done.
I have to go where I'm needed.

158
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:43,334
- Well, we need you.
- Dad needs you.

159
00:07:43,501 --> 00:07:45,795
Look, it's not like I'm leaving
right this minute.

160
00:07:45,962 --> 00:07:48,840
I'll help you get settled in
while I look for a new job.

161
00:07:49,048 --> 00:07:50,383
- But, Daphne...
- Oh, please,

162
00:07:50,591 --> 00:07:53,511
don't make a big fuss about this.
You'll just make me cry.

163
00:07:53,719 --> 00:07:54,971
This is no time for tears.

164
00:07:55,138 --> 00:07:57,306
Well, I guess you know what's best.

165
00:07:57,473 --> 00:08:00,476
It's sure gonna be Ionely though,
just the two of us.

166
00:08:00,643 --> 00:08:04,522
It won't just be the two of you,
you'll have Eddie.

167
00:08:27,211 --> 00:08:30,548
- Dad.
- Eddie, whatever you're on, get off.

168
00:08:33,092 --> 00:08:36,929
I've been on hold
with my employment agency forever.

169
00:08:37,096 --> 00:08:40,808
And thanks again for making me feel
so welcome here until I find a new job.

170
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:43,102
Yes, I'm here.

171
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:46,647
Nothing at all?
Not even part-time therapy?

172
00:08:46,814 --> 00:08:49,233
Well, I'll stay in touch. Bye-bye.

173
00:08:50,192 --> 00:08:52,528
So no job yet, eh?

174
00:08:52,736 --> 00:08:54,154
No, unfortunately.

175
00:08:54,321 --> 00:08:58,242
Still, tragedies happen every day.
I mustn't give up hope.

176
00:09:01,036 --> 00:09:02,746
I wish you'd consider
staying here with us.

177
00:09:02,913 --> 00:09:04,998
I don't know how Dad's gonna
manage without you.

178
00:09:05,207 --> 00:09:06,333
He doesn't need me anymore.

179
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,210
Nonsense.
I know he puts on a brave front,

180
00:09:08,377 --> 00:09:10,796
but the plain truth is,
the man is practically an invalid.

181
00:09:10,963 --> 00:09:13,132
All right, come back here.

182
00:09:13,298 --> 00:09:14,842
- What's he got now?
- Oh, my sneaker.

183
00:09:15,008 --> 00:09:16,051
You give me that back

184
00:09:16,218 --> 00:09:19,054
or I'm not taking you
for your speed walk.

185
00:09:21,306 --> 00:09:23,016
- Oh, hi, Frasier.
- Hi, Dad. Hi, Niles.

186
00:09:23,183 --> 00:09:26,019
Forgive me, I know how annoying
it can be to drop by without calling.

187
00:09:26,186 --> 00:09:27,604
Oh, don't worry, I used to do it.

188
00:09:27,813 --> 00:09:29,398
That's how I know. Hello, Eddie.

189
00:09:30,607 --> 00:09:34,778
I've got a surprise for you, something
you left at the house. There we are.

190
00:09:42,703 --> 00:09:45,705
Don't worry, Niles,
you'll get used to it.

191
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:51,336
Oh, and, Dad, I've got a little surprise
for you as well.

192
00:09:51,503 --> 00:09:53,004
All right, boys, bring it on in here.

193
00:09:53,171 --> 00:09:57,092
Oh, great, here it is. Now this place
is starting to look like home.

194
00:09:57,259 --> 00:09:59,469
Yes, and finally so is mine.

195
00:09:59,678 --> 00:10:01,346
Well, I'm just gonna go
finish unpacking.

196
00:10:01,513 --> 00:10:03,056
Well, you just follow him up
with that.

197
00:10:03,223 --> 00:10:04,307
Oh, no, no, leave it there.

198
00:10:04,474 --> 00:10:07,727
That way I won't get my pizza cheese
all over your fancy chairs.

199
00:10:07,894 --> 00:10:09,688
Doesn't the cheese
go in your mouth?

200
00:10:09,896 --> 00:10:12,983
That's certainly the goal, but you can't
hit that bull's-eye every time.

201
00:10:14,651 --> 00:10:17,070
Okay, this isn't working out.
You have to take him back now.

202
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:19,322
- He's been here for eight hours.
- I don't care.

203
00:10:19,531 --> 00:10:21,950
I only signed on for this because
Daphne came in the bargain

204
00:10:22,117 --> 00:10:24,327
and she's leaving.
You have to help me, I'm desperate.

205
00:10:24,536 --> 00:10:27,038
Niles, which wall should I hang
my swordfish on?

206
00:10:27,205 --> 00:10:31,376
None of them,
I just had that room frescoed.

207
00:10:32,794 --> 00:10:35,129
- Daph.
- Thanks, Rhonda, you're a lifesaver.

208
00:10:35,296 --> 00:10:36,839
Bye-bye.

209
00:10:37,006 --> 00:10:38,591
Well, good news
on the employment front?

210
00:10:38,758 --> 00:10:40,802
Yes, a friend of mine
just got me an interview.

211
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:44,305
It's an elderly woman suffering from
brittle bone disease, the poor thing.

212
00:10:44,514 --> 00:10:46,891
Oh, well, normally I'd say
break a leg but...

213
00:10:48,017 --> 00:10:51,646
Oh, I'm gonna miss you. All of you.

214
00:10:51,813 --> 00:10:55,400
But like I told your brother,
there's simply no reason for me to stay

215
00:10:55,566 --> 00:10:57,902
as long as your father's
so strong and healthy.

216
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:02,490
Oh, dear God.

217
00:11:03,616 --> 00:11:05,952
- Oh, my God, Dad.
- Oh, are you all right?

218
00:11:06,119 --> 00:11:07,578
- Yeah.
- What happened? Come on.

219
00:11:07,745 --> 00:11:11,082
- I don't know. L...
- Oh, we just got tangled up there.

220
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:12,667
- Dad, I am so sorry.
- Oh, my God.

221
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:14,752
Oh, don't worry about it,
it was an accident.

222
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:16,837
Well, you do seem
to be in one piece.

223
00:11:17,046 --> 00:11:19,715
Still, it was an awfully big fall.
Would you help me get some ice?

224
00:11:19,882 --> 00:11:22,760
Good thinking, Daphne.
I know I could use a drink.

225
00:11:25,137 --> 00:11:27,515
- Boy, that was so weird.
- Yeah.

226
00:11:27,682 --> 00:11:31,018
Niles just kicked my cane out
right from under me.

227
00:11:35,272 --> 00:11:37,274
Yeah, I know he wants
to keep Daphne around here

228
00:11:37,441 --> 00:11:39,485
but I didn't think he'd go that far.

229
00:11:40,236 --> 00:11:41,737
Well, no, not deliberately,

230
00:11:41,904 --> 00:11:45,533
but maybe he was acting
on an unconscious level.

231
00:11:45,741 --> 00:11:48,035
What are you talking about?
I was just making a joke.

232
00:11:48,536 --> 00:11:51,372
- Oh, well, then just skip it, Dad.
- No, no, wait a minute.

233
00:11:51,539 --> 00:11:53,874
You think Niles was actually
trying to hurt me?

234
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:59,463
No, no, it's just that sometimes,
when the motivation is strong enough,

235
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:01,799
the unconscious can cause a person
to act in ways

236
00:12:01,966 --> 00:12:03,842
that the conscious
would find unthinkable.

237
00:12:04,051 --> 00:12:06,553
So you're saying that this
wasn't an accident?

238
00:12:07,388 --> 00:12:11,100
Oh, it's a crazy theory.
I'm sorry I even brought it up.

239
00:12:11,308 --> 00:12:14,686
You know what?
I think I'll be off now.

240
00:12:14,853 --> 00:12:16,522
Off to my bachelor pad.

241
00:12:16,688 --> 00:12:20,150
I have a date tonight
with a lingerie model.

242
00:12:20,317 --> 00:12:22,986
Well, bachelor pad, lingerie model.

243
00:12:23,153 --> 00:12:26,323
The sweetest words
in the English language.

244
00:12:26,823 --> 00:12:28,033
I'm sorry I won't be there.

245
00:12:28,242 --> 00:12:31,078
Wait, we have a tie.

246
00:12:32,162 --> 00:12:33,205
Frasier...

247
00:12:33,413 --> 00:12:36,249
All right, Mr. Crane, I need you
to take a seat so I can ice your hip.

248
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:39,378
I'm fine. Why is everybody
making such a big fuss?

249
00:12:39,586 --> 00:12:41,588
- Wait, don't sit down.
- What?

250
00:12:41,755 --> 00:12:44,174
- You nearly impaled yourself.
- Oh, my God.

251
00:12:44,341 --> 00:12:47,010
Oh, thank you, Daphne. I don't know
what it is about these things,

252
00:12:47,177 --> 00:12:50,097
they keep ending up
in the oddest places.

253
00:13:32,013 --> 00:13:33,765
<i>Hi, Frasier, it's Rebecca.</i>

254
00:13:33,932 --> 00:13:36,434
<i>Your voice sounds so sexy
on your machine.</i>

255
00:13:36,601 --> 00:13:40,063
<i>Anyway, I loved talking to you
this afternoon, and I was thinking,</i>

256
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:44,192
<i>instead of going to a noisy restaurant,
maybe we could just stay in tonight,</i>

257
00:13:44,359 --> 00:13:47,779
<i>open some wine,
curl up in front of the fire.</i>

258
00:13:47,946 --> 00:13:48,988
<i>Just a warning though,</i>

259
00:13:49,155 --> 00:13:52,992
<i>I'm coming straight from a shoot
so I'll be wearing my work clothes.</i>

260
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:56,788
<i>I can't believe I said that. Bye.</i>

261
00:14:22,104 --> 00:14:24,315
<i>Hi, Frasier, it's Rebecca.</i>

262
00:14:24,523 --> 00:14:26,484
<i>Your voice sounds so sexy
on your machine.</i>

263
00:14:26,651 --> 00:14:29,278
<i>Anyway, I loved talking...</i>

264
00:14:31,989 --> 00:14:34,909
Boy, the floors around here
are so slippery.

265
00:14:35,076 --> 00:14:37,912
- Yes, I just had them polished.
- Well, I wish you would've told me.

266
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,373
Eddie just slid into a wall
and chipped his tooth.

267
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:44,835
Now he whistles when he breathes.

268
00:14:47,755 --> 00:14:50,800
Well, Dad, I can assure you,
there'll be no slipping in here.

269
00:14:50,966 --> 00:14:54,678
Look, a brand-new safety rail
installed just for you.

270
00:14:54,845 --> 00:14:58,182
And, as requested, traction decals.

271
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:00,893
Well, I don't need to worry
about falling in...

272
00:15:03,562 --> 00:15:04,605
Dad, are you okay?

273
00:15:04,772 --> 00:15:06,940
Wow, yeah. It's a good thing
I wasn't in the shower,

274
00:15:07,107 --> 00:15:09,276
- I could've cracked my head open.
- Oh, Dad...

275
00:15:09,443 --> 00:15:12,112
I guess I'm not much
of a handyman, am I?

276
00:15:15,866 --> 00:15:17,826
You put this thing up yourself?

277
00:15:17,993 --> 00:15:20,287
Yes, my contractor was out of town.
Don't worry,

278
00:15:20,746 --> 00:15:23,332
you can use my bathroom to shower.
Just let me know when you do.

279
00:15:23,499 --> 00:15:26,001
The plumbing's temperamental,
if I were to run the dishwasher,

280
00:15:26,168 --> 00:15:28,212
you might be horribly scalded.

281
00:15:28,629 --> 00:15:30,881
You know, I took an extra-Iong shower
yesterday.

282
00:15:31,048 --> 00:15:33,217
You know, that ought to hold me.

283
00:15:36,845 --> 00:15:39,681
- You sure you don't need a hand?
- Just keep moving.

284
00:15:42,059 --> 00:15:43,185
Guess what.

285
00:15:43,393 --> 00:15:46,313
I got the job. I can't believe it,
I start in the morning.

286
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,482
- You what?
- I'll tell you about it later.

287
00:15:48,648 --> 00:15:52,152
I have to call my employment agency
right away.

288
00:15:56,823 --> 00:16:00,452
- I can't let her leave. I just can't.
- There's nothing we can do about it.

289
00:16:00,911 --> 00:16:02,871
I still have a day.

290
00:16:03,622 --> 00:16:05,123
Just have to be more resourceful.

291
00:16:05,332 --> 00:16:06,750
Like how?

292
00:16:08,585 --> 00:16:12,797
It's my problem, not yours.
I just have to think.

293
00:16:13,006 --> 00:16:15,175
Fresh air.
Maybe that'll calm me down.

294
00:16:15,342 --> 00:16:18,345
Oh, look at the sunset.

295
00:16:18,553 --> 00:16:22,098
Dad, come join me on the balcony.

296
00:16:23,683 --> 00:16:27,354
Eddie, get out of here, quick.
Come on, come on, come on.

297
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,105
Come on.

298
00:16:52,837 --> 00:16:54,422
Dad!

299
00:16:55,131 --> 00:16:57,383
- Lord, what are you doing here?
- Look, we gotta talk.

300
00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:00,261
- Now? Not a good time.
- But it's getting spooky over at Niles'.

301
00:17:00,428 --> 00:17:02,096
I know it's unsettling
the way he changes

302
00:17:02,263 --> 00:17:05,183
into that Chinese dressing gown
after dinner, but you'll get used to it.

303
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:07,477
No, I think his unconscious
is trying to hurt me.

304
00:17:07,643 --> 00:17:09,395
- Dad, that's preposterous.
- No, it isn't.

305
00:17:09,604 --> 00:17:11,189
Can't we talk about this
in the morning?

306
00:17:11,355 --> 00:17:14,484
There is no way your own flesh
and blood would try to hurt you.

307
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:15,735
I'm sorry.

308
00:17:15,902 --> 00:17:18,738
Well, at least let me get Eddie's pillow
out of my room, will you?

309
00:17:18,905 --> 00:17:21,365
All right, but just hurry it up, will you?

310
00:17:32,835 --> 00:17:34,629
Daphne.

311
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:37,632
What is going on?

312
00:17:37,798 --> 00:17:39,550
I hope I'm not catching you
at a bad time.

313
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:42,803
- Well, actually, I'm waiting for a date.
- Well, I'll just run in and out.

314
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:45,765
I need to pick up my exercise mat.

315
00:17:45,973 --> 00:17:48,267
Oh, good Lord.
Is everything all right?

316
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:52,313
I'm sorry, I think I'm just a bit nervous
about my new job.

317
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,940
- Yes, yes.
- I'll be all right.

318
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:57,651
I just wish I didn't miss
being here so much.

319
00:17:57,818 --> 00:17:59,069
Oh, Daphne.

320
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:02,656
Oh, I'm sorry.
Listen, you're gonna be just fine.

321
00:18:02,823 --> 00:18:05,367
You know,
transitions are always difficult.

322
00:18:05,534 --> 00:18:08,078
The trick is just not to rush them.

323
00:18:21,717 --> 00:18:23,594
Niles!

324
00:18:24,261 --> 00:18:25,637
What the hell are you doing here?

325
00:18:25,804 --> 00:18:27,097
I'm going out of my mind.

326
00:18:27,264 --> 00:18:29,641
I am this close to living under
the same roof with Daphne...

327
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:31,435
Before you go on,
let me say one thing.

328
00:18:31,643 --> 00:18:32,686
- What is it?
- Get out.

329
00:18:32,853 --> 00:18:35,772
- Wait, wait, I need to talk about this.
- Is that Niles?

330
00:18:35,981 --> 00:18:38,817
Dad, hey, why did you run off?
I've been looking for you everywhere.

331
00:18:38,984 --> 00:18:40,611
- No, Niles, stay away from me.
- What?

332
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:43,071
Now, Niles, I'm not mad at you,
just your unconscious.

333
00:18:43,238 --> 00:18:46,283
It wants Daphne to stay around so bad
that it's been trying to hurt me.

334
00:18:46,491 --> 00:18:49,077
- What?
- Well, Frasier can explain it better.

335
00:18:49,911 --> 00:18:53,206
Exactly who is hurting whom, and what
does any of this have to do with...?

336
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:57,586
- Daphne.
- Oh, look, we're all together again,

337
00:18:57,753 --> 00:19:01,506
- just like old times.
- Oh, dear. Oh, God.

338
00:19:01,673 --> 00:19:03,925
Well, we certainly do
have a lot to talk about.

339
00:19:04,092 --> 00:19:06,595
Tell you what, let's meet at Niles'
for breakfast tomorrow.

340
00:19:06,762 --> 00:19:08,430
I'm not getting in the elevator
with him.

341
00:19:08,597 --> 00:19:10,307
Dad, Daphne, go in shifts then.
You first.

342
00:19:10,474 --> 00:19:11,766
- All right.
- Go on.

343
00:19:11,933 --> 00:19:14,102
Eddie, you too.
Shake a leg, mister, let's go.

344
00:19:14,269 --> 00:19:17,856
- Right now, out of here.
- Move it, move it, move it.

345
00:19:20,233 --> 00:19:22,986
You actually convinced Dad
I was trying to harm him?

346
00:19:23,194 --> 00:19:24,279
Niles, I did no such thing.

347
00:19:24,446 --> 00:19:27,198
I simply advanced a theory.
I had no idea he would take it to heart.

348
00:19:27,407 --> 00:19:29,326
- Oh, balderdash.
- Oh, please, Niles.

349
00:19:29,492 --> 00:19:30,660
Surely it's occurred to you,

350
00:19:30,827 --> 00:19:33,705
your desire for Daphne is forcing
you to behave in very strange ways.

351
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:36,541
Or do you shove Dad
down the stairs every day?

352
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,460
- That was an accident!
- Oh, Niles,

353
00:19:38,626 --> 00:19:41,713
any psychiatrist worth his salt knows
that there are no accidents.

354
00:19:42,172 --> 00:19:44,549
No one would do something like that,
however unconsciously,

355
00:19:44,716 --> 00:19:47,051
unless they stood to gain from it.

356
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:49,304
Oh, dear.

357
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:51,014
Oh, my God.

358
00:19:51,181 --> 00:19:54,142
Oh, thank God. We're here to help.

359
00:19:54,309 --> 00:19:56,311
What did you kick my cane for?

360
00:19:56,519 --> 00:19:58,521
It was an accident.
I was playing with Eddie.

361
00:19:58,730 --> 00:19:59,897
My hip's killing me.

362
00:20:00,064 --> 00:20:01,316
Dad, don't worry about it.

363
00:20:01,524 --> 00:20:03,985
Niles has a nice comfy bed
you can recuperate in.

364
00:20:04,193 --> 00:20:05,862
I can't go up and down
those stairs now!

365
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:08,239
The best thing would be for him
to stay with you.

366
00:20:08,448 --> 00:20:10,908
He'll need full-time attention.
I'll cancel my job...

367
00:20:11,117 --> 00:20:12,285
All right, just hold it!

368
00:20:12,452 --> 00:20:14,495
Nobody's cancelling anything.

369
00:20:14,704 --> 00:20:16,247
The man fell down stairs today.

370
00:20:16,414 --> 00:20:19,584
He could hardly have been hurt worse
stumbling in a carpeted hallway.

371
00:20:19,792 --> 00:20:22,128
All right, now get up, you big crybaby.
No pain, no gain.

372
00:20:22,295 --> 00:20:25,047
- Oh, no, but it hurts!
- Boohoo, I want you out of here.

373
00:20:25,256 --> 00:20:27,842
I don't care if you have to crawl
like a bog turtle.

374
00:20:29,677 --> 00:20:31,554
Rebecca.

375
00:20:32,471 --> 00:20:34,390
I didn't see you standing there.

376
00:20:36,058 --> 00:20:37,727
Why don't you just step on
over my father,

377
00:20:37,893 --> 00:20:39,312
help yourself to some wine?

378
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,273
What kind of a heartless bastard
are you?

379
00:20:42,481 --> 00:20:45,526
No, Rebecca, you don't understand.
It's not the way it looks.

380
00:20:45,735 --> 00:20:49,613
He's very resilient.
He's been shot before.

381
00:20:53,159 --> 00:20:56,162
Dr. Crane,
we really should get him inside.

382
00:20:56,328 --> 00:21:01,375
Yes, just give me a moment.

383
00:21:32,322 --> 00:21:33,782
All right, bring him in.
