1
00:00:10,597 --> 00:00:12,724
- Oh, hey, Niles.
- Hey, Roz.

2
00:00:12,933 --> 00:00:16,019
Oh, God, do you realise
how pathetic this is?

3
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:17,980
It's 9:30 on a Saturday night

4
00:00:18,188 --> 00:00:21,817
and neither one of us are surprised
to see the other one here alone.

5
00:00:22,067 --> 00:00:23,944
Never seen this place
looking so grim.

6
00:00:24,152 --> 00:00:26,029
This is Mardi Gras
compared to half an hour ago

7
00:00:26,196 --> 00:00:28,156
when it was just me
and an elderly gentleman

8
00:00:28,365 --> 00:00:31,535
who cleaned his teeth
with his coffee stirrer

9
00:00:31,702 --> 00:00:34,162
and then put them back
in his mouth.

10
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:40,085
- Let me get the waitress.
- Oh, God, not her. I hate her.

11
00:00:41,753 --> 00:00:44,589
She's in my spinning class at the gym.
I've been killing myself

12
00:00:44,798 --> 00:00:48,385
trying to take off these last five
pregnancy pounds, and nothing.

13
00:00:48,593 --> 00:00:51,054
Meanwhile, she's down
at the snack bar stuffing her face

14
00:00:51,263 --> 00:00:53,306
and waving to everybody,
acting all friendly.

15
00:00:53,515 --> 00:00:54,891
She's such a phoney.

16
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:56,268
- Hi, Roz.
- Hey, Kit.

17
00:00:56,476 --> 00:00:58,520
You were great in class tonight.

18
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:01,523
Are you kidding?
I've been such an oinker lately.

19
00:01:01,731 --> 00:01:04,401
- What can I get you?
- Oh, a non-fat latte for me.

20
00:01:04,567 --> 00:01:05,610
Coming right up.

21
00:01:05,819 --> 00:01:08,488
See what I mean?
She's such a fake.

22
00:01:08,655 --> 00:01:11,491
I'm sorry, Roz, I'm afraid I'm not gonna
be very good company tonight.

23
00:01:11,658 --> 00:01:13,785
Well, whatever your problems are,
you'll laugh at them

24
00:01:13,993 --> 00:01:15,453
when you hear
what I've been through.

25
00:01:15,662 --> 00:01:18,665
I had a date tonight,
but halfway down the driveway,

26
00:01:18,832 --> 00:01:20,542
he called me on my car phone
and cancelled.

27
00:01:20,708 --> 00:01:24,379
So I was too humiliated to go back
in the house and face the sitter.

28
00:01:24,587 --> 00:01:28,174
So don't ask me why,
I went to the zoo.

29
00:01:28,383 --> 00:01:29,759
You wanna feel good
about yourself?

30
00:01:29,926 --> 00:01:32,220
Put on your best outfit
and walk through the monkey house

31
00:01:32,428 --> 00:01:33,471
on a Saturday night.

32
00:01:34,305 --> 00:01:36,432
And be sure to stop by
and see Remo the Baboon

33
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:40,311
who knows all kinds of ways
to have fun without a date.

34
00:01:43,606 --> 00:01:45,566
Feeling better about your problem?

35
00:01:46,234 --> 00:01:48,444
Daphne and Donny
got engaged yesterday.

36
00:01:48,653 --> 00:01:49,654
Oh, my God.

37
00:01:49,862 --> 00:01:52,615
Yeah, and lucky me,
I had to sit there and watch, horrified.

38
00:01:52,824 --> 00:01:54,700
Wasn't a thing I could do to stop it,

39
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:57,829
much like your
monkey-house experience.

40
00:01:58,871 --> 00:02:01,541
I am so sorry, Niles. You really did
have a worse night than I did.

41
00:02:01,749 --> 00:02:06,379
- Hey, Roz.
- Wait, I'm gaining on you.

42
00:02:06,587 --> 00:02:09,507
Isn't this a splendiferous surprise?

43
00:02:09,674 --> 00:02:14,387
- So, Roz, Dr. Crane, is this a date?
- No, no, no, just a chance meeting.

44
00:02:14,553 --> 00:02:17,390
- Oh, great.
- Sorry.

45
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:22,353
So, Roz, where is this person
you told me you had a date with?

46
00:02:22,561 --> 00:02:26,315
- That got cancelled.
- Oh, "cancelled," you say.

47
00:02:26,524 --> 00:02:30,820
And here you are showing up
at my regular Saturday-night hangout.

48
00:02:31,028 --> 00:02:33,239
Will the coincidences never stop?

49
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:37,409
Perhaps you'd care to join me
for a late supper.

50
00:02:37,576 --> 00:02:41,872
No, Noel. As I said earlier today,
I am really not in the mood.

51
00:02:42,081 --> 00:02:44,291
Playing hard to get, I see.

52
00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:50,214
It's all part of the mating dance.
Watch and learn.

53
00:02:59,974 --> 00:03:01,934
- Morning.
- Oh, Niles.

54
00:03:02,101 --> 00:03:05,020
Armani at 8 in the morning
on a Sunday?

55
00:03:05,187 --> 00:03:06,730
Yes, yes,
I'm having lunch with Maris.

56
00:03:06,939 --> 00:03:07,981
With Maris?

57
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:11,193
Yeah, we scheduled this weeks ago.
She still has some of my first editions.

58
00:03:11,401 --> 00:03:13,195
I thought she'd be amenable
to returning them

59
00:03:13,403 --> 00:03:14,947
if I took her to her favourite bistro.

60
00:03:15,114 --> 00:03:19,576
Well, then the worst you're out
is a cup of clear broth.

61
00:03:19,827 --> 00:03:22,913
No, no, this is lunch. She takes
her large meal in the evening.

62
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:27,960
I'm sorry to barge in so early.
I had to get out of the Montana.

63
00:03:28,168 --> 00:03:29,711
The couple next door
were just married.

64
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,090
They kept me up all week
with their boisterous lovemaking.

65
00:03:33,966 --> 00:03:35,676
Why is it that
when you're by yourself,

66
00:03:35,884 --> 00:03:38,637
there's nothing but couples in love
rubbing it in your face?

67
00:03:38,845 --> 00:03:40,722
- Good morning.
- Oh, hi.

68
00:03:44,851 --> 00:03:46,311
Are you gonna join us for breakfast?

69
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,647
- Well, actually...
- Oh, come on, you've got to.

70
00:03:48,855 --> 00:03:50,023
I brought some pastries.

71
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:52,317
I didn't even hear you two
come in last night.

72
00:03:52,484 --> 00:03:55,403
Yeah, well, we got in kind of late.
We took a long walk after dinner.

73
00:03:55,612 --> 00:03:57,072
Yeah, it was great.

74
00:03:57,322 --> 00:03:59,616
The streets were deserted,
it was all misty out.

75
00:03:59,824 --> 00:04:03,328
It was like we were
the only two people in town.

76
00:04:04,037 --> 00:04:06,456
I wonder if Maris would rather
have breakfast than lunch.

77
00:04:06,665 --> 00:04:07,916
No, Niles, here, put that down.

78
00:04:08,124 --> 00:04:09,918
Wait, now, Frasier,
if Niles wants to leave...

79
00:04:10,126 --> 00:04:12,087
Dad, there is no reason for Niles
to feel awkward.

80
00:04:12,295 --> 00:04:14,255
You're here,
it's not like he's some third wheel.

81
00:04:14,506 --> 00:04:15,882
Good morning.

82
00:04:18,426 --> 00:04:20,387
Hey.

83
00:04:24,015 --> 00:04:25,642
You boys remember Bonnie
from McGinty's.

84
00:04:25,809 --> 00:04:27,519
- Yes.
- I was at the Super Bowl, remember?

85
00:04:27,727 --> 00:04:29,771
- I brought the ham loaf.
- Well, who could forget?

86
00:04:30,605 --> 00:04:33,358
We talked about it long after.

87
00:04:33,817 --> 00:04:35,944
It came up almost daily.

88
00:04:36,569 --> 00:04:37,737
Aren't you sweet.

89
00:04:37,946 --> 00:04:41,032
- I'm just gonna get some coffee.
- Okay.

90
00:04:43,701 --> 00:04:45,828
You could've told me
you were having Faye over.

91
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:49,165
Well, I'm sorry, Dad,
I didn't realise you were seeing Bonnie.

92
00:04:49,332 --> 00:04:50,500
I see her from time to time.

93
00:04:50,667 --> 00:04:52,460
- You got a problem with Bonnie?
- Well, no.

94
00:04:52,669 --> 00:04:55,046
If you're bringing it up,
I have second thoughts about Faye.

95
00:04:55,254 --> 00:04:57,298
I liked the other one you were seeing,
Cassandra.

96
00:04:57,507 --> 00:05:00,093
- She was a dish.
- Look, I don't care.

97
00:05:00,593 --> 00:05:03,763
I prefer Faye.
I had to make a choice,

98
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:06,265
no matter how much fun it was
dating two beautiful women.

99
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:10,061
This morning just gets better
and better.

100
00:05:10,311 --> 00:05:13,314
- Who wants coffee and pastry?
- Oh, nothing for me, thanks.

101
00:05:13,523 --> 00:05:15,233
Are you sure?
I make a mean nut cake.

102
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:18,486
No, that's all right,
I'm meeting one for lunch.

103
00:05:20,404 --> 00:05:23,074
So, Bonnie,
I see you've met Cassandra.

104
00:05:23,282 --> 00:05:26,619
- Who?
- Oh, Lord, I'm sorry.

105
00:05:26,786 --> 00:05:29,705
- Faye.
- Who's Cassandra?

106
00:05:29,872 --> 00:05:34,752
My Aunt Cassandra, yes,
that must be the connection.

107
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,253
So you remind me a bit of her.

108
00:05:36,462 --> 00:05:39,006
And, God, she was an angel,
wasn't she, Dad?

109
00:05:39,215 --> 00:05:42,802
Oh, Cassandra? Great gal.
I wish she was around.

110
00:05:44,887 --> 00:05:48,807
Eddie, good morning.
I bet you can't wait to meet Lady.

111
00:05:49,058 --> 00:05:51,268
Yeah, we're getting Eddie together
with Bonnie's poodle.

112
00:05:51,477 --> 00:05:54,146
We figure if we hit it off, maybe
something will happen for them.

113
00:05:54,355 --> 00:05:56,315
Even dogs deserve happiness.

114
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:58,817
Okay, well, I'll be off.

115
00:05:59,443 --> 00:06:01,487
Oh, hold on, you've got a loose button
right there.

116
00:06:01,654 --> 00:06:04,990
- No, no, it's all right. No, no, please...
- No, it's about to come off. See?

117
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,786
Here, I'll sew it back on for you.

118
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:10,329
I've got needle and thread.

119
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:12,748
- You don't wanna lose it, do you?
- I'm trying not to.

120
00:06:12,915 --> 00:06:18,587
- Frasier, I have to get out of here.
- Niles, Niles, listen, just relax.

121
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:20,964
There's no cause for an anxiety attack.
Come on.

122
00:06:21,173 --> 00:06:23,300
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

123
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:26,970
Breathe into this.

124
00:06:28,514 --> 00:06:31,516
I didn't know you were here last night.
Why doesn't someone say something?

125
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:32,976
We planned on going to my place,

126
00:06:33,185 --> 00:06:36,104
but we ended up at a little piano bar
just around the corner from here.

127
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:38,231
It was such a charming spot,
so intimate.

128
00:06:38,482 --> 00:06:41,318
And to top it off, the piano player
knew all my favourite songs.

129
00:06:41,485 --> 00:06:43,528
"Yesterday,"
"As Long as He Needs Me,"

130
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:45,405
"Climb Ev'ry Mountain."

131
00:06:45,614 --> 00:06:48,033
Wow, you threw him
some real curves there.

132
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:52,537
Hi. I'm Donny Douglas,
and I'm in love.

133
00:06:54,206 --> 00:06:57,709
Listen to him. He embarrasses me
like that at least ten times a day.

134
00:06:57,876 --> 00:06:59,669
And I just can't get enough of it.

135
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:07,677
- How are we coming on the button?
- I almost got the needle threaded.

136
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:12,557
You know, if anybody's hungry,

137
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:16,770
we've got plenty of goodies here
from Le Cigare Volant.

138
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:20,315
- Cassandra's the pastry chef there.
- She is? I thought I was.

139
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:22,859
I'm so sorry. God, I did it again.

140
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:26,112
I guess I must have her name
on my mind.

141
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:29,199
Well, that's okay,
just try to remember mine.

142
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:33,411
- Faye.
- Yeah, Faye, of course.

143
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:36,247
Oh, Faye.

144
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:37,790
I'm kind of glad this worked out.

145
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:40,293
Neither Daphne nor I
has any family here in Seattle.

146
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:42,712
What I'd like to do
is I'd like to make this

147
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:44,589
our engagement breakfast...

148
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:50,470
...surrounded by friends
who treat us like family.

149
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:51,804
And I'd like to dedicate it

150
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:56,559
to the woman who's filled my life
with a joy I never thought I'd find.

151
00:07:58,686 --> 00:07:59,771
- Hear, hear.
- Hear, hear.

152
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:01,564
Oh, Marty, I'm gonna cry.

153
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:05,318
- Oh, jeez.
- Oh, my God, look at that ring.

154
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,244
That's it for today.
This is Dr. Frasier Crane

155
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:18,372
saying goodbye
and good mental health.

156
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:21,667
Nice job there, Roz.

157
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:24,712
Could you try to find callers
that have real psychological problems?

158
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,964
Your dad's on line two.

159
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:29,342
I meant during the show, thanks.

160
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:33,596
Yeah, Dad, hi.

161
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:36,766
What? Again? Well, that's
the third time he's cancelled this week.

162
00:08:36,932 --> 00:08:38,642
You know, if he's been so Ionely,

163
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:41,896
you'd think he'd be glad
for my company. Well...

164
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:45,524
Well, all right, no matter.
I guess I'll see you at home in a while.

165
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:47,359
Well, I don't know, later.

166
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:51,405
I don't know, maybe an hour,
two hours, I don't know.

167
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:52,740
Oh, for God's sake.

168
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:56,410
Look, just hang a tie on the door
if you're so worried about it.

169
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,376
Is everything okay, Frasier?

170
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:08,464
Oh, yeah, yeah, Roz.
I was just thinking about something.

171
00:09:08,672 --> 00:09:11,216
You know, it's funny how Ioneliness

172
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:13,135
can make people behave
in strange ways.

173
00:09:13,385 --> 00:09:14,386
What do you mean?

174
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:17,681
Well, you know, do things
that are sort of rash, you know,

175
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,183
act out of character.

176
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:20,976
I knew someone would find out
about it.

177
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:22,311
Who told you? Did he tell you?

178
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:23,687
- I'll kill him.
- Roz.

179
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:26,106
Please, Frasier, don't tell anybody else.
Oh, I beg you.

180
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:28,525
It was one night.
One Ionely, stupid night.

181
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:30,194
What are you talking about?

182
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,863
- You don't know?
- No. What happened?

183
00:09:33,113 --> 00:09:36,867
- Nothing. I'll see you tomorrow.
- No, Roz, Roz, Roz. Stay right here.

184
00:09:37,075 --> 00:09:39,286
Now, you listen to me,
I am your friend, you know that.

185
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:41,580
I would never judge you.

186
00:09:41,788 --> 00:09:44,708
Now, just how stupid and Ionely
were you?

187
00:09:45,667 --> 00:09:49,004
It's the last person
I ever would have dreamed of.

188
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:51,548
I just guess I haven't been...

189
00:09:52,299 --> 00:09:56,428
I haven't been dating much lately,
and I've just been so Ionely.

190
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:59,556
Oh, my God, you slept with Noel.

191
00:09:59,806 --> 00:10:03,560
No! Oh, how could you even think
such a thing?

192
00:10:03,727 --> 00:10:07,063
All right, now, listen, listen, just tell me.
Now, who was it?

193
00:10:07,272 --> 00:10:09,649
Nobody. It doesn't matter.
It was a mistake. It's over.

194
00:10:09,858 --> 00:10:11,318
I just wanna forget it ever happened.

195
00:10:11,526 --> 00:10:14,195
No, Roz, Roz, listen, you know,
we've all been there.

196
00:10:14,404 --> 00:10:16,823
Come on, you were just looking
for a little comfort.

197
00:10:17,032 --> 00:10:19,951
It's all right.
No reason to beat yourself up about it.

198
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,370
Hey, baby, I'm sorry I had to skip out
before breakfast.

199
00:10:22,579 --> 00:10:25,248
- Oh, Bulldog.
- Bulldog?

200
00:10:25,457 --> 00:10:27,959
- Bulldog.
- Bulldog!

201
00:10:30,045 --> 00:10:32,255
Oh, Frasier,
swear you won't tell anybody else.

202
00:10:32,464 --> 00:10:34,758
So you told the doc, huh?
Guess you just had to brag, huh?

203
00:10:34,966 --> 00:10:37,802
Hey, hey, I don't blame you.
I told a few guys myself.

204
00:10:37,969 --> 00:10:40,013
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.

205
00:10:40,263 --> 00:10:44,642
- Gee, where have I heard that before?
- I'll just leave you two alone.

206
00:10:44,893 --> 00:10:47,645
- I'm right behind you.
- Gee, where have I heard that before?

207
00:10:47,854 --> 00:10:50,440
Stop that.

208
00:10:51,482 --> 00:10:53,359
Look, Bulldog,
last night was a mistake.

209
00:10:53,526 --> 00:10:55,778
I will regret it for the rest of my life.

210
00:10:55,987 --> 00:10:59,490
And if you ever bring it up again,
I promise you, you will regret it.

211
00:10:59,657 --> 00:11:01,034
Hey.

212
00:11:08,499 --> 00:11:12,170
- Your place tonight.
- Ten o'clock. Use the service elevator.

213
00:11:20,678 --> 00:11:23,681
- How's the speech coming along?
- Oh, it's almost finished.

214
00:11:23,931 --> 00:11:29,520
So though you are graduating today,
your learning is just begun.

215
00:11:30,479 --> 00:11:33,149
There's something in the cushions
back here.

216
00:11:33,357 --> 00:11:35,067
- What, you found something?
- Yeah, it's...

217
00:11:35,276 --> 00:11:38,029
Oh, it's a cell phone.
Is this Frasier's?

218
00:11:38,195 --> 00:11:40,323
No, he had his when he left for work
this morning.

219
00:11:40,489 --> 00:11:43,159
Must be his brother's.
I'll tell him the next time he's over.

220
00:11:43,367 --> 00:11:46,454
I'm gonna finish tidying up
the kitchen.

221
00:11:47,413 --> 00:11:48,414
Hello.

222
00:11:48,664 --> 00:11:50,875
- Hey, Fras.
- Hello, Donny.

223
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:53,752
Hope I didn't come home
at an inconvenient moment.

224
00:11:53,961 --> 00:11:57,047
No, your timing's perfect, actually.
One egg roll left.

225
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:59,842
- Nice hands.
- Yes, they were.

226
00:12:01,802 --> 00:12:03,846
- Here's your drink.
- Oh, thanks. Isn't she great?

227
00:12:04,013 --> 00:12:08,559
She takes me on a three-mile run
and then feeds me diet soda.

228
00:12:08,767 --> 00:12:11,604
I thought I'd hate healthy living,
but, you know, it ain't so bad.

229
00:12:12,354 --> 00:12:15,107
Daphne, why are you wearing
that rubber glove?

230
00:12:15,274 --> 00:12:19,111
What, this? I was doing the dishes.

231
00:12:19,278 --> 00:12:22,448
- With just one?
- It's the English way.

232
00:12:23,157 --> 00:12:24,950
You wash with the left,
dry with the right.

233
00:12:25,117 --> 00:12:27,578
Started during the war, I think,
when rubber was rationed.

234
00:12:27,828 --> 00:12:29,204
Oh, yes.

235
00:12:29,788 --> 00:12:31,748
- Can I see you in the kitchen?
- Yes, of course.

236
00:12:31,957 --> 00:12:34,418
Let me just call Niles first.
He cancelled on me again today.

237
00:12:34,626 --> 00:12:37,629
I'll just be a second here. I just gotta
check up on a case I'm finishing.

238
00:12:37,796 --> 00:12:40,257
Poor bastard,
I'm really taking him to the cleaners.

239
00:12:40,465 --> 00:12:44,761
Well, perhaps you'd be so kind
as to bring the couch along.

240
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:45,971
Yes, Daphne?

241
00:12:46,179 --> 00:12:47,973
I'm afraid a terrible thing
has happened.

242
00:12:48,181 --> 00:12:51,435
- I've lost my engagement ring.
- Where was the last place you saw it?

243
00:12:51,643 --> 00:12:53,520
Well, that's just it,
I've searched everywhere.

244
00:12:53,687 --> 00:12:55,230
I'm terrified Donny will find out.

245
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,357
You can't go around
hiding your hand forever.

246
00:12:57,566 --> 00:13:00,902
You're gonna have to tell him. He's
a reasonable man, he'll understand.

247
00:13:01,111 --> 00:13:02,112
I suppose you're right.

248
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,656
No, you're negligent, pal.
You're criminally irresponsible.

249
00:13:04,865 --> 00:13:07,242
You were careless
and you're gonna pay for it. Yeah.

250
00:13:07,451 --> 00:13:08,827
- Here you go, boss.
- Thank you.

251
00:13:08,994 --> 00:13:11,454
- Hey, Daph?
- Yes, love?

252
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:14,040
What are you doing?

253
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:18,128
Oh, I'm just stuffing the bird
for Dr. Crane's dinner.

254
00:13:19,713 --> 00:13:21,923
Listen, unfortunately,
I'm gonna have to work late.

255
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:23,800
I'm gonna just pop in the shower
and leave.

256
00:13:23,967 --> 00:13:24,968
Oh, I'm sorry.

257
00:13:25,176 --> 00:13:28,096
Well, that's okay. Absence just
makes the heart grow fonder.

258
00:13:33,768 --> 00:13:36,312
You know, Daphne,
if that ring never turns up,

259
00:13:36,521 --> 00:13:39,858
that chicken works too.
Just see how it catches the light.

260
00:13:40,066 --> 00:13:42,652
Oh, stop it. I'm just gonna have
another look in the bedroom.

261
00:13:42,861 --> 00:13:44,237
All right.

262
00:13:44,446 --> 00:13:46,322
Yeah, hello?

263
00:13:46,489 --> 00:13:49,576
Niles, it's Frasier.

264
00:13:49,742 --> 00:13:53,454
Yes, listen, I've tried you at your office,
I've tried you at home,

265
00:13:53,663 --> 00:13:55,290
now I'm calling your cell phone.

266
00:13:55,456 --> 00:13:59,836
If I don't reach you now, I'm actually
going to get very worried about you.

267
00:14:15,059 --> 00:14:16,144
Hello?

268
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:17,937
Yes, hello.
Is Niles Crane there, please?

269
00:14:18,187 --> 00:14:22,024
I don't know, I just got here.
Let me go check.

270
00:14:25,987 --> 00:14:27,155
Frasier, have you seen Niles?

271
00:14:27,321 --> 00:14:29,532
- I'm just trying to reach him, Dad.
- Oh, okay.

272
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:36,330
No, I'm sorry, he's not here,

273
00:14:36,539 --> 00:14:40,835
but I'll write your name down
and give it to him.

274
00:14:41,002 --> 00:14:43,212
Wait a minute, I gotta find a pen.

275
00:14:47,216 --> 00:14:50,553
- Fras, have you seen...?
- Dad, please, I'm on the phone.

276
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,765
Well, I'm sorry,
I was just looking for a pen. Forget it.

277
00:15:01,021 --> 00:15:04,608
Hello? Listen, could you maybe
call back in an hour?

278
00:15:04,817 --> 00:15:06,694
- Dad.
- Would you mind, please?

279
00:15:06,902 --> 00:15:08,779
I'm on the phone.

280
00:15:12,741 --> 00:15:14,201
Dad, it's me.

281
00:15:14,368 --> 00:15:17,037
Frasier, what are you doing?
Why'd you call from the kitchen?

282
00:15:17,204 --> 00:15:20,124
- You could have just walked in here.
- Just hang up the phone.

283
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:24,044
For God's sake,
it must be Niles' cell phone...

284
00:15:24,253 --> 00:15:26,797
Gee, that's strange. You know,
he's never without that phone.

285
00:15:28,173 --> 00:15:30,843
And what's more, he's been
avoiding me for the last three days.

286
00:15:31,051 --> 00:15:32,594
Oh, cut him a little slack.

287
00:15:32,845 --> 00:15:35,931
Seeing the six of us the other morning
couldn't have done much for his mood.

288
00:15:36,098 --> 00:15:38,642
He's probably just gone off somewhere
to be by himself.

289
00:15:38,851 --> 00:15:40,644
I just hope
he hasn't done something foolish.

290
00:15:40,894 --> 00:15:43,647
Remember, he was having brunch
with Maris on Sunday.

291
00:15:43,856 --> 00:15:45,107
Oh, that was just business.

292
00:15:45,315 --> 00:15:47,985
Yeah. Well, you know, Dad,
he is broken-hearted.

293
00:15:48,193 --> 00:15:51,113
People in his condition have
a tendency to run back to their exes.

294
00:15:51,321 --> 00:15:53,991
A Ionely man clinging
to an available warm body.

295
00:15:54,199 --> 00:15:58,578
Well, of course, in Maris' case,
that's just an expression.

296
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:03,166
He just spent two years divorcing her,
he's not gonna go back to her.

297
00:16:03,417 --> 00:16:05,127
Yeah, I hope you're right.

298
00:16:05,335 --> 00:16:07,379
Say, didn't you have plans today
with Bonnie?

299
00:16:07,587 --> 00:16:09,464
No, it was cut short.

300
00:16:09,673 --> 00:16:12,092
- We had an incident.
- What happened?

301
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,261
Well, we took the dogs
to this park near Bonnie's,

302
00:16:14,469 --> 00:16:17,139
and I knew there'd be a little
sizing each other up and everything,

303
00:16:17,347 --> 00:16:21,560
but this poodle of hers, Lady,
which she ain't,

304
00:16:22,477 --> 00:16:24,104
walks up to Eddie, knocks him over,

305
00:16:24,312 --> 00:16:28,066
and then sits her big French butt
right on his head.

306
00:16:28,817 --> 00:16:29,818
- You're kidding.
- No.

307
00:16:30,026 --> 00:16:32,779
And the worst thing was he
just laid there whimpering and took it.

308
00:16:32,988 --> 00:16:35,448
And Bonnie,
she thought it was really cute.

309
00:16:35,615 --> 00:16:39,035
I mean, what kind of a person
likes to see a dog humiliated?

310
00:16:39,285 --> 00:16:41,955
Dad, may I remind you
that not a holiday goes by

311
00:16:42,163 --> 00:16:45,166
that you don't dress that dog up
in some sort of ridiculous hat?

312
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:47,836
There's nothing wrong with those hats.
He looks good in hats.

313
00:16:48,044 --> 00:16:49,212
He's got a hat face.

314
00:16:50,046 --> 00:16:53,216
Well, he was probably just intimidated
being in Lady's park, you know?

315
00:16:53,424 --> 00:16:55,135
Wait till he gets over
to this side of town.

316
00:16:55,343 --> 00:16:58,012
He owns that park.
Even the big dogs are scared of him.

317
00:16:58,179 --> 00:17:01,099
That's because they've seen him
in his hats, they think he's crazy.

318
00:17:03,726 --> 00:17:05,979
It's Niles' cell phone.

319
00:17:07,981 --> 00:17:11,567
Hello? Niles Crane's phone.

320
00:17:13,027 --> 00:17:17,740
Yes, it's his brother.
I'll be glad to tell him. Thank you.

321
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:24,956
Well, that was St. Pierre Jewelers.

322
00:17:25,164 --> 00:17:27,708
The diamond earrings Niles ordered
are ready.

323
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:30,545
Diamond earrings?

324
00:17:30,753 --> 00:17:32,547
From Maris' favourite jeweller.
You know what?

325
00:17:32,755 --> 00:17:34,966
He's too ashamed to tell us
that he's run back to her.

326
00:17:35,174 --> 00:17:38,761
Oh, now, stop that, you're scaring me.
He doesn't have to be with Maris.

327
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:41,889
Maybe he's hurt.
Maybe he's in a hospital or something.

328
00:17:42,098 --> 00:17:44,392
We've got to track him down
and talk some sense into him.

329
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,853
We'll head over to the Montana.
If he's not there, we'll go to Maris'.

330
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:50,940
Well, I don't wanna go to Niles'
and I sure don't wanna go to Maris'.

331
00:17:51,148 --> 00:17:53,984
This is not about what you or I want,
this is about what Niles needs.

332
00:17:54,151 --> 00:17:55,861
The man is devastated,
he's vulnerable.

333
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:58,030
We need to rally around him,
show him our support.

334
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:02,118
- Why didn't we do this on Sunday?
- We had our girlfriends over.

335
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:12,044
Dad, what are you doing back there?
What are you so worried about?

336
00:18:12,253 --> 00:18:13,796
What do you think?
Running into Maris.

337
00:18:13,963 --> 00:18:15,256
You know how angry she gets.

338
00:18:15,464 --> 00:18:18,717
I just wish we had a sharp stick
or a heavy net or something.

339
00:18:19,885 --> 00:18:21,053
- Niles.
- Yes?

340
00:18:21,262 --> 00:18:23,764
Where have you been? You haven't
even answered any of my calls.

341
00:18:23,973 --> 00:18:25,933
Frasier, I am so sorry.
I'll call you tomorrow.

342
00:18:26,141 --> 00:18:28,268
No, no, no.
I wanna talk to you right now.

343
00:18:28,519 --> 00:18:30,646
Well, I can't, I'm entertaining,
so off you go.

344
00:18:30,813 --> 00:18:33,482
We're not leaving without you.
Put on your shower shoes and a coat.

345
00:18:33,691 --> 00:18:35,734
- Let's get out of here.
- What is wrong with you?

346
00:18:35,984 --> 00:18:38,362
I know how difficult the last
three weeks have been for you,

347
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:40,364
but I am sorry,
you are making a big mistake.

348
00:18:40,572 --> 00:18:42,032
This is not the way to handle it.

349
00:18:42,241 --> 00:18:44,910
- So you know what's going on?
- Yes, Niles.

350
00:18:45,077 --> 00:18:46,703
How did this whole thing
even get started?

351
00:18:46,912 --> 00:18:50,165
Well, we had an impromptu coffee
at the Café Nervosa,

352
00:18:50,374 --> 00:18:52,584
and that led to a movie,
and that led to dinner,

353
00:18:52,793 --> 00:18:55,254
and then ever since then,
we've been practically inseparable.

354
00:18:55,462 --> 00:18:57,673
And to tell you the truth,
we're kind of happy about it.

355
00:18:57,881 --> 00:18:59,841
How do you even know about this?

356
00:19:01,134 --> 00:19:05,597
Your jeweller called.
Your diamond earrings are ready.

357
00:19:05,764 --> 00:19:07,724
Oh, well, thank you for the message.
Now, go away.

358
00:19:07,933 --> 00:19:10,185
No, Niles, no.
I'm sorry, we're not going anywhere.

359
00:19:10,394 --> 00:19:12,604
You may consider this
a full-blown intervention.

360
00:19:12,854 --> 00:19:15,774
We're not leaving until you have got
some self-respect back.

361
00:19:15,982 --> 00:19:18,026
Niles, you know what we should
do tonight? Oh, hi.

362
00:19:18,276 --> 00:19:21,113
Build a fire and make Smores.

363
00:19:21,321 --> 00:19:24,241
Might also wanna get
some graham crackers.

364
00:19:24,908 --> 00:19:26,952
Oh, I'm sorry,
I didn't know we had company.

365
00:19:27,118 --> 00:19:30,997
- No, no, that's okay, Kit. This is...
- Wait, I know you from the café.

366
00:19:31,206 --> 00:19:34,793
Cappuccino, light foam. And you too,
coffee black, nothing fancy.

367
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,836
Isn't that good?

368
00:19:37,045 --> 00:19:40,882
Kit, this is my father, Martin,
and my brother, Frasier.

369
00:19:41,049 --> 00:19:45,970
- Yes, how do you do?
- Really? I see it. Cool.

370
00:19:46,179 --> 00:19:48,473
You know, this is sort of a surprise.

371
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,976
I guess I didn't expect to see
the two of you together.

372
00:19:52,227 --> 00:19:54,187
Oh, I had my eye on him
from the minute I saw him.

373
00:19:54,395 --> 00:19:59,192
He's always so neat and put together.
I just wanted to mess him up.

374
00:20:01,027 --> 00:20:03,488
And mission accomplished.

375
00:20:03,655 --> 00:20:07,700
So, Niles, you haven't seen Maris then
since Sunday?

376
00:20:09,244 --> 00:20:10,787
Is that who you thought
I was here with?

377
00:20:10,995 --> 00:20:12,538
That's funny.
No wonder you were upset.

378
00:20:12,747 --> 00:20:14,791
- Who's Maris?
- That's my ex-wife.

379
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:16,918
Oh, well, if you wanna see her too,
that's cool.

380
00:20:17,126 --> 00:20:22,006
I told you, no strings, just fun.

381
00:20:22,215 --> 00:20:25,843
You always want your kids
to have more than you had.

382
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:36,187
Niles, pick up, will you? It's Frasier.

383
00:20:36,854 --> 00:20:40,107
All right, fine. Call me later.

384
00:20:40,316 --> 00:20:41,859
I don't even know
why I bother anymore.

385
00:20:42,068 --> 00:20:46,697
He doesn't pick up phones these days,
just waitresses.

386
00:20:47,823 --> 00:20:50,284
Give him a break,
he's just having fun.

387
00:20:50,534 --> 00:20:51,702
That's what I'd expect to hear

388
00:20:51,911 --> 00:20:55,414
from someone willing to spend
the night as Bulldog's squeak toy.

389
00:20:56,916 --> 00:20:59,043
That is not funny. It was one night,

390
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:01,420
and I would appreciate it
if you would just let it drop.

391
00:21:01,629 --> 00:21:03,839
You're right, I'm sorry,
that was tactless of me.

392
00:21:04,048 --> 00:21:06,717
Let me make it up to you.
I've got an extra theatre ticket tonight.

393
00:21:06,926 --> 00:21:08,552
Faye's busy.
Why don't you join me?

394
00:21:08,761 --> 00:21:10,137
- No, thanks.
- No, please, Roz.

395
00:21:10,304 --> 00:21:14,266
Look, it's a delightful little show,
and I'll even throw in dinner.

396
00:21:14,475 --> 00:21:16,894
- Busy.
- Really? A date?

397
00:21:17,144 --> 00:21:19,730
I have plans. Plans.
What are you, a cop?

398
00:21:19,939 --> 00:21:21,565
I got to account
for every waking minute?

399
00:21:21,774 --> 00:21:25,819
- My private life is my own business.
- Bulldog.

400
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:28,739
I don't know what's wrong with me.
I'm weak, I can't stop myself.

401
00:21:28,989 --> 00:21:31,033
- Yes, you can.
- Okay, I don't wanna stop myself.

402
00:21:31,241 --> 00:21:34,995
He's good, he's really good.
I mean, I'm better, but he's trainable.

403
00:21:35,621 --> 00:21:38,457
Roz, it's Bulldog.
Doesn't that bother you?

404
00:21:38,665 --> 00:21:41,085
You'd think.

405
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:43,003
- Hey, doc.
- Bulldog.

406
00:21:43,212 --> 00:21:47,841
Oh, Roz, you still gonna help me write
those promos for my show tonight?

407
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:50,594
- Around 10:00?
- It's okay, Bulldog, he knows.

408
00:21:50,803 --> 00:21:54,223
Yes, but high marks
on that cryptic cover story.

409
00:21:55,974 --> 00:21:56,975
Well, I gotta make a call.

410
00:21:57,184 --> 00:21:59,394
Station manager's been
calling me all day.

411
00:22:01,271 --> 00:22:02,981
I made us a reservation.

412
00:22:03,148 --> 00:22:06,652
Thought maybe we could
get a little dinner first.

413
00:22:07,736 --> 00:22:10,656
You mean eat together?

414
00:22:11,948 --> 00:22:14,951
Yeah. I'll be right back.

415
00:22:18,497 --> 00:22:19,873
That's beautiful, Roz.

416
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,626
- Oh, God, this ruins everything.
- What?

417
00:22:22,876 --> 00:22:25,337
Well, didn't you hear what he said?
He wants to buy me dinner.

418
00:22:25,545 --> 00:22:26,838
Do you realise what this means?

419
00:22:27,088 --> 00:22:30,008
They finally opened that new Hooters
out by the airport?

420
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:34,679
No, he's crossed the line.
He actually thinks we're dating.

421
00:22:34,888 --> 00:22:38,725
Roz, didn't your mother warn you that
sex could lead to things like dating?

422
00:22:38,934 --> 00:22:43,980
Look, that is it. I'm gonna put an end
to this before it goes too far.

423
00:22:48,318 --> 00:22:49,527
Can't believe it.

424
00:22:50,528 --> 00:22:52,155
They just fired me.

425
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:54,949
What?

426
00:22:55,575 --> 00:23:01,831
Yeah, said my ratings were low,
show's losing its edge, I'm getting soft.

427
00:23:01,998 --> 00:23:06,461
- My last day's Friday.
- Oh, Bulldog, I'm so sorry.

428
00:23:06,711 --> 00:23:10,215
- Are you all right?
- No, I'm not.

429
00:23:10,423 --> 00:23:15,762
This stinks. This is total B.S. You don't
think I'm getting soft, do you?

430
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:18,973
No, no, not at all. Here.

431
00:23:21,059 --> 00:23:24,062
I just thank God
I got a girlfriend like you, Roz.

432
00:23:29,067 --> 00:23:31,110
I don't think I could face this alone.

433
00:23:32,612 --> 00:23:34,405
There, there.

434
00:23:47,084 --> 00:23:49,045
Daphne.

435
00:23:49,795 --> 00:23:51,339
- Morning, Dad.
- Hi.

436
00:23:51,547 --> 00:23:53,257
Yes?

437
00:23:55,551 --> 00:23:57,261
Daphne, please, Donny's not here.

438
00:23:57,428 --> 00:24:00,014
Will you just take your hand
out of the bag?

439
00:24:00,264 --> 00:24:02,224
I was just undressing
to take my bath,

440
00:24:02,391 --> 00:24:07,563
and I sat on the edge of the tub
and landed on this.

441
00:24:07,772 --> 00:24:11,108
Oh, my God, you found my ring.

442
00:24:12,276 --> 00:24:15,112
I'd given up. I thought
it was some place I'd never find it.

443
00:24:15,321 --> 00:24:17,364
It very nearly was.

444
00:24:20,367 --> 00:24:23,204
- Come on, let me have it.
- No, rinse off this doodle dust first.

445
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:25,748
- Oh, right, of course.
- All right, yeah.

446
00:24:25,956 --> 00:24:27,666
Well, you sure saved Daphne there.

447
00:24:27,875 --> 00:24:29,752
Yes, I also did myself
a little favour as well.

448
00:24:30,002 --> 00:24:32,296
Can you imagine what conclusions
Faye might have jumped to

449
00:24:32,504 --> 00:24:35,341
had she found this engagement ring
in my room?

450
00:24:35,507 --> 00:24:39,553
- Frasier, for me? I had no idea.
- Well, actually...

451
00:24:39,803 --> 00:24:45,893
It's beautiful. It's so beautiful.
Yes, Frasier, I do, I do.

452
00:24:47,603 --> 00:24:51,190
Oh, calm down, you big dope.
I know it's Daphne's ring.

453
00:24:54,735 --> 00:24:56,445
And I can't tell you
how flattered I am

454
00:24:56,612 --> 00:24:58,739
by those beads of sweat
on your forehead.

455
00:24:58,989 --> 00:25:02,618
No, they're love beads, honey.
Oh, God. Will you take this thing?

456
00:25:02,826 --> 00:25:04,953
Well, I don't want it.
What if Bonnie sees me with it?

457
00:25:05,162 --> 00:25:06,705
Sees you with what?

458
00:25:06,914 --> 00:25:09,458
Daphne, will you come in here
and take this damn ring, please?

459
00:25:09,666 --> 00:25:12,336
- Coming.
- Sit down, have a little coffee.

460
00:25:12,586 --> 00:25:14,046
Good morning, everybody.

461
00:25:14,254 --> 00:25:16,048
- Hi.
- Another full house, I see.

462
00:25:16,214 --> 00:25:19,885
Yes, and that robe is available
for purchase in the gift shop.

463
00:25:21,553 --> 00:25:22,846
- Hi.
- Good morning.

464
00:25:23,055 --> 00:25:28,477
- Oh, you found your ring.
- What? You knew it was gone?

465
00:25:28,685 --> 00:25:31,855
Well, Daphne, when your fiancée gives
you a hug with a chicken on her hand,

466
00:25:32,063 --> 00:25:33,857
then bells go off.

467
00:25:34,274 --> 00:25:35,901
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, it's okay, honey.

468
00:25:36,109 --> 00:25:37,402
I didn't wanna say anything.

469
00:25:37,611 --> 00:25:40,614
I knew it'd turn up sooner or later,
I didn't wanna make you feel worse.

470
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:43,241
As long as we're tying up loose ends,
I was just wondering,

471
00:25:43,408 --> 00:25:45,785
what was your ring doing
on the edge of my Jacuzzi tub

472
00:25:45,994 --> 00:25:48,038
right next to my favourite
scented candle

473
00:25:48,246 --> 00:25:50,540
which was burned down
to the wick?

474
00:25:51,541 --> 00:25:54,544
I'm gonna let my attorney
handle this one.

475
00:25:56,338 --> 00:26:00,091
I'm sorry, Fras. You know,
I guess after a little champagne,

476
00:26:00,258 --> 00:26:03,428
we got into the mood and into the nude
and into the tub.

477
00:26:03,636 --> 00:26:06,806
So... And, you know, don't worry,
we'll replace the candle.

478
00:26:07,056 --> 00:26:09,517
If only you could replace the image.

479
00:26:11,978 --> 00:26:13,104
Next time, if you don't mind,

480
00:26:13,313 --> 00:26:15,273
would you just turn down
the temperature a little?

481
00:26:15,481 --> 00:26:17,192
Actually, we tried,
but the knob was stuck.

482
00:26:17,358 --> 00:26:20,361
Yeah, it does that.
You gotta jiggle it a little.

483
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:30,246
Don't worry, it's not what you think.
We use it to give Eddie a bath.

484
00:26:32,749 --> 00:26:34,375
- Hey, guys, how are you doing?
- Hi, Dad.

485
00:26:34,584 --> 00:26:36,961
- Morning.
- Nice to see you.

486
00:26:44,177 --> 00:26:46,929
- Well, you're up early.
- You mean still up.

487
00:26:47,096 --> 00:26:50,683
- We never went to bed.
- We'll get there.

488
00:26:51,642 --> 00:26:54,729
- What'd you do all night?
- Oh, well, what didn't we do?

489
00:26:54,979 --> 00:26:56,147
We started off at a concert,

490
00:26:56,314 --> 00:26:58,190
a wonderful group
called Uncle Dirt Nap.

491
00:26:59,275 --> 00:27:02,028
Then we danced the night away
at every club in the U District

492
00:27:02,194 --> 00:27:04,071
before finding ourselves
at an after-party

493
00:27:04,238 --> 00:27:07,491
at Kit's friend, Massimo's place.
He's a squatter.

494
00:27:09,368 --> 00:27:11,495
Anyway, I wanted to give Kit
the keys to my building,

495
00:27:11,704 --> 00:27:13,998
and I have a spare set here,
so I thought we'd pop by.

496
00:27:14,206 --> 00:27:16,417
- Well, then let me get them for you.
- Thanks.

497
00:27:16,667 --> 00:27:19,336
I can offer you a pastry
courtesy of Le Cigare Volant.

498
00:27:19,545 --> 00:27:22,298
No, thanks. You know, those things
are loaded with bleached flour.

499
00:27:22,506 --> 00:27:25,009
That stuff's poison.

500
00:27:27,553 --> 00:27:29,930
Niles, give me your cell phone.
I'll call the travel agent.

501
00:27:30,097 --> 00:27:31,390
- Oh, you going on a trip?
- Yeah.

502
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:33,934
He's taking me to France
for the weekend, Euro Disney.

503
00:27:36,145 --> 00:27:41,650
Massimo said we just had to go.
Apparently it is so lame it's cool.

504
00:27:42,234 --> 00:27:43,777
Well, I should get going.

505
00:27:44,486 --> 00:27:49,825
- Places to go, people to poison.
- I should get going too.

506
00:27:50,034 --> 00:27:52,494
I'll pick up Lady and meet you
and Eddie at the park at 10:30?

507
00:27:52,703 --> 00:27:55,372
- Better make it 11.
- Okay, I'll see you then.

508
00:27:55,581 --> 00:28:00,210
- Bye. Oh, bye, Bonnie.
- Bye, Frasier.

509
00:28:01,086 --> 00:28:05,215
- Frasier, isn't she great?
- Oh, yes.

510
00:28:06,925 --> 00:28:12,055
She's so free, so spontaneous.
She has breathed new life into me.

511
00:28:15,183 --> 00:28:17,686
You may have to return the favour.

512
00:28:20,439 --> 00:28:24,901
- Am I detecting disapproval?
- No, no, Niles, not at all. I'm just...

513
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:29,322
Well, all right. Don't you think you two
are going just a bit quickly?

514
00:28:29,531 --> 00:28:31,908
For the past year, you've told me
I had to get over Daphne,

515
00:28:32,075 --> 00:28:34,578
find someone else. Now I do,
and all you can do is find fault?

516
00:28:34,786 --> 00:28:36,329
Man, you are such a buzzkill.

517
00:28:39,875 --> 00:28:42,961
Will you stop talking like that?
I'm just a little concerned, Niles.

518
00:28:43,170 --> 00:28:45,839
You met this girl last week
and she's spent every night with you.

519
00:28:46,006 --> 00:28:47,966
You're giving her the keys
to your apartment.

520
00:28:48,216 --> 00:28:49,509
I think you're just jealous.

521
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:51,052
- Jealous?
- Yes.

522
00:28:51,303 --> 00:28:54,139
Here I have attracted
this untamed free spirit.

523
00:28:54,347 --> 00:28:55,974
You're saddled
with an uptight pastry chef

524
00:28:56,182 --> 00:28:57,392
whose name you can't remember.

525
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,477
Her name is Faye.

526
00:29:01,146 --> 00:29:04,899
And I am not jealous,
I'm just a little worried about you.

527
00:29:05,108 --> 00:29:08,445
- I'm afraid you might get hurt.
- Oh, here we go.

528
00:29:08,611 --> 00:29:11,281
Whatever would I do
without my wise older brother

529
00:29:11,448 --> 00:29:12,449
to tell me what to do?

530
00:29:12,657 --> 00:29:14,617
Frankly, you couldn't be acting
more like a child.

531
00:29:14,826 --> 00:29:16,786
You think I don't know the reason
you came here?

532
00:29:16,995 --> 00:29:20,248
It wasn't to get your keys, it was
to show off Lolita's kid sister out there.

533
00:29:22,292 --> 00:29:24,711
The two of you have
absolutely nothing in common.

534
00:29:24,961 --> 00:29:28,381
- Well, we're all set for Euro Disney.
- Oh, great. You ready to go home?

535
00:29:28,548 --> 00:29:30,425
- Oh, sure. Bye, Frasier.
- Bye.

536
00:29:30,633 --> 00:29:32,343
Oh, I'm so excited for this trip.

537
00:29:32,552 --> 00:29:35,305
I'm gonna spend all my time
in Fantasyland.

538
00:29:35,513 --> 00:29:40,560
Oh, Niles, I'm sorry, I take it back.
You do have something in common.

539
00:29:55,783 --> 00:29:57,827
Isn't that a darling sight?

540
00:29:58,035 --> 00:30:00,705
Time was, when a waitress said,
"Can I warm that up for you,"

541
00:30:00,872 --> 00:30:02,748
she was talking about your coffee.

542
00:30:06,335 --> 00:30:08,546
How was your date with Bulldog
last night?

543
00:30:08,713 --> 00:30:10,006
Hideous.

544
00:30:10,256 --> 00:30:12,842
He took me to a nice restaurant,
he bought me flowers,

545
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:15,511
and then we went back to his place
and cuddled.

546
00:30:15,678 --> 00:30:18,764
All I could think of the whole time was,
"How do I dump this loser?"

547
00:30:19,015 --> 00:30:20,474
Oh, Roz.

548
00:30:20,683 --> 00:30:23,769
He's meeting me here for coffee, and
I'm ending this thing once and for all.

549
00:30:24,019 --> 00:30:26,480
Yeah, well,
good luck getting a cup of coffee.

550
00:30:28,274 --> 00:30:31,861
You know, it's the funniest thing,
he really does look happy, doesn't he?

551
00:30:32,069 --> 00:30:34,363
- Yeah, so just leave it alone.
- Oh, maybe you're right.

552
00:30:34,572 --> 00:30:37,157
Do you realise that this is the first time
in recent history

553
00:30:37,366 --> 00:30:39,660
that all three Crane men
have been in happy relationships?

554
00:30:39,869 --> 00:30:43,789
Maybe I should be celebrating that fact
rather than being such a buzzkill.

555
00:30:45,457 --> 00:30:48,460
- What does that mean?
- Oh, Roz, plug in.

556
00:30:50,754 --> 00:30:52,131
Hi, honey, it's Frasier.

557
00:30:52,339 --> 00:30:56,719
Listen, I just read a marvellous review
of this charming boîte out in Fremont,

558
00:30:56,885 --> 00:31:00,305
and I thought to myself, "That is a
place that Cassandra would just love."

559
00:31:00,472 --> 00:31:01,473
- So...
- Frasier.

560
00:31:01,682 --> 00:31:04,143
- Not now, Roz, please...
- You just called her Cassandra.

561
00:31:04,893 --> 00:31:07,104
Oh, dear God, I'm...

562
00:31:07,729 --> 00:31:11,400
My producer, Roz, informs me
that I just called you Cassandra.

563
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:14,236
I'm sorry,
I don't know why I keep doing this.

564
00:31:14,444 --> 00:31:19,241
I know that you're Faye.
Fabulous Faye. Forever Faye.

565
00:31:19,408 --> 00:31:21,451
Call me, Faye.

566
00:31:22,244 --> 00:31:24,663
It is one syllable.
What the hell is wrong with me?

567
00:31:26,248 --> 00:31:28,125
Well, I'm glad to see
that you think it's funny.

568
00:31:28,333 --> 00:31:29,501
No, I don't, I'm just...

569
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:34,005
I'm having a flashback
to my summer of Ted, Todd and Tad.

570
00:31:35,716 --> 00:31:40,011
- Hey, sports fans.
- Bulldog, hi. You know what?

571
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:42,889
You may have my seat.
I'm gonna sit over there.

572
00:31:43,056 --> 00:31:44,933
All right.

573
00:31:45,976 --> 00:31:46,977
Hey, gorgeous.

574
00:31:47,185 --> 00:31:49,646
You and I need to talk about
what's been going on between us.

575
00:31:49,896 --> 00:31:52,983
- I know.
- We're in public.

576
00:31:53,191 --> 00:31:57,320
Look, look, I wanna tell you
what's going on in here, okay?

577
00:31:57,529 --> 00:32:00,865
- Bulldog, I don't wanna know...
- No, Roz, I gotta be honest with you.

578
00:32:01,032 --> 00:32:03,326
This past week has been amazing.

579
00:32:05,245 --> 00:32:07,914
But I met a total babe
at Unemployment this morning

580
00:32:08,081 --> 00:32:11,000
and we're going to Hawaii
this afternoon.

581
00:32:11,918 --> 00:32:13,169
- What?
- I know, I know.

582
00:32:13,378 --> 00:32:15,004
Getting dumped, ouch,
it hurts like hell.

583
00:32:15,213 --> 00:32:17,674
No, no, I don't believe this.
I came here to dump you.

584
00:32:17,924 --> 00:32:20,927
Hey, whatever you gotta say
to get through this, it's okay with me.

585
00:32:21,136 --> 00:32:24,139
No, no, no, I know, I know. I didn't
mean to make you fall in love with me.

586
00:32:24,347 --> 00:32:28,393
- I didn't, you repulse me.
- Hey, love hurts, Roz.

587
00:32:28,643 --> 00:32:32,146
And I'm not talking about the time
we fell off the kitchen table.

588
00:32:32,355 --> 00:32:33,731
Aloha, old friend.

589
00:32:33,898 --> 00:32:37,944
Bulldog, you cuddle lousy
and I'm glad you got fired.

590
00:32:38,736 --> 00:32:43,533
- Well, timing is everything.
- Back off, buzzkill.

591
00:32:48,538 --> 00:32:50,498
- Hey, Fras.
- Oh, hey, Dad.

592
00:32:50,665 --> 00:32:53,000
Black coffee to go, please.

593
00:32:53,209 --> 00:32:57,255
- You okay?
- I just broke it off with Bonnie.

594
00:32:57,463 --> 00:33:01,092
Oh, gee, I'm so sorry.
What happened?

595
00:33:01,926 --> 00:33:04,512
Lady humped Eddie.

596
00:33:07,265 --> 00:33:11,143
- Excuse me?
- You heard me. It was humiliating.

597
00:33:11,352 --> 00:33:16,232
Yeah, but Eddie's a boy dog
and Lady is, well, a lady.

598
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:19,694
Yes, well, that would be
the humiliating part, now, wouldn't it?

599
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:23,030
Right in his own park
in front of all these other dogs.

600
00:33:24,615 --> 00:33:26,867
Yeah, Bonnie got a big kick
out of it too.

601
00:33:27,076 --> 00:33:29,537
- Sorry.
- And I told her off, and that was it.

602
00:33:29,787 --> 00:33:31,414
Sorry, Dad.

603
00:33:31,664 --> 00:33:34,166
- It's not funny.
- I know, I know, I know.

604
00:33:34,583 --> 00:33:36,293
Was he wearing a hat?

605
00:33:38,128 --> 00:33:41,382
No, no, Dad, Dad, please,
come back, come on.

606
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:43,551
- Hi, Martin.
- Hey, Faye.

607
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:45,386
- Hi, honey.
- Hi.

608
00:33:45,553 --> 00:33:48,722
I was near the station, so I thought
I'd just see if you were around.

609
00:33:48,889 --> 00:33:52,935
Well, great.
Oh, Roz, you remember Faye.

610
00:33:54,019 --> 00:33:55,020
Hi, Faye.

611
00:33:55,229 --> 00:33:57,439
You were going to say Cassandra,
weren't you?

612
00:33:57,648 --> 00:34:01,568
- Why would you think such a thing?
- Well, I just checked my messages.

613
00:34:01,819 --> 00:34:04,405
I'm so sorry.
I don't know why it keeps happening.

614
00:34:04,613 --> 00:34:06,323
You just have
this remarkable resemblance...

615
00:34:06,573 --> 00:34:08,534
I know, I know, your aunt.

616
00:34:10,077 --> 00:34:14,540
- I'll be right back.
- I have got to stop saying "Cassandra."

617
00:34:14,748 --> 00:34:18,252
- Frasier.
- Cassandra.

618
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:20,504
- Hi, Roz.
- Hi, Cassandra.

619
00:34:21,004 --> 00:34:23,298
- So how have you been?
- Great.

620
00:34:23,549 --> 00:34:25,342
I've been wanting to talk to you
for a while.

621
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:29,179
We've been sort of avoiding each other
at work, and it just all seems so silly.

622
00:34:29,429 --> 00:34:31,390
I mean, I really don't have
any hard feelings

623
00:34:31,556 --> 00:34:33,016
about the way things ended
between us.

624
00:34:33,266 --> 00:34:35,477
Oh, well, that's wonderful.
You know, neither do I.

625
00:34:35,686 --> 00:34:36,978
You dumped me.

626
00:34:37,187 --> 00:34:39,231
You're not allowed to have
hard feelings.

627
00:34:39,398 --> 00:34:40,524
Anyway, my life is great.

628
00:34:40,732 --> 00:34:42,776
- I'm back together with Sloane.
- Oh, well...

629
00:34:42,984 --> 00:34:44,778
You and I should have coffee
some time.

630
00:34:44,986 --> 00:34:45,987
That would be nice, yes.

631
00:34:46,196 --> 00:34:48,323
I'm glad we're putting
all this awkwardness behind us.

632
00:34:48,532 --> 00:34:50,158
Me too.

633
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:54,329
- Frasier.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

634
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:57,040
- Hello.
- Hello.

635
00:34:57,207 --> 00:34:59,876
- Well...
- Whoa, I gotta get back to work.

636
00:35:00,043 --> 00:35:01,586
You going back to the station?

637
00:35:01,753 --> 00:35:03,296
- Yes.
- Good, I'll walk with you.

638
00:35:03,463 --> 00:35:05,590
Oh, my gosh, look at the time.
We better hurry.

639
00:35:05,799 --> 00:35:07,842
- Bye, Frasier. Bye-bye, Faye.
- Bye-bye, love you.

640
00:35:08,009 --> 00:35:09,552
Yes, you do.

641
00:35:11,471 --> 00:35:13,598
- Who was that?
- You know Roz.

642
00:35:13,848 --> 00:35:18,228
- No, no, no, the other one.
- Oh, she's the promotions director.

643
00:35:18,395 --> 00:35:20,605
- Yeah, well, she's gorgeous.
- Oh, you think so?

644
00:35:20,772 --> 00:35:23,942
- I never really looked.
- Well, don't start looking now.

645
00:35:26,236 --> 00:35:28,112
If I'm gonna stay,
I should feed the metre.

646
00:35:28,321 --> 00:35:30,198
Lucky metre.

647
00:35:32,784 --> 00:35:34,327
- Hey, there, Frasier.
- Oh, Niles, hi.

648
00:35:34,536 --> 00:35:38,122
Listen, Niles, I want to apologise
for getting upset this morning.

649
00:35:38,331 --> 00:35:39,707
I've been giving it some thought.

650
00:35:39,874 --> 00:35:42,710
I think maybe
Kit is just what the doctor ordered.

651
00:35:42,961 --> 00:35:45,338
Is she ever.

652
00:35:45,546 --> 00:35:47,090
And no strings, just fun, right?

653
00:35:47,298 --> 00:35:49,425
- That's what she said.
- Exactly.

654
00:35:49,676 --> 00:35:51,135
- So you really like her?
- Yes, I do.

655
00:35:51,344 --> 00:35:53,471
- And you're not just saying that?
- Absolutely not.

656
00:35:53,679 --> 00:35:55,306
You want her?

657
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:58,810
- Excuse me?
- Frasier, she's killing me.

658
00:36:02,438 --> 00:36:05,525
I'm just not cut out for this lifestyle.

659
00:36:05,733 --> 00:36:07,610
Between seeing myself in a mirror
at the club

660
00:36:07,777 --> 00:36:09,654
dancing my modified Charleston

661
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:13,074
and catching my reflection
in a store window this morning

662
00:36:13,241 --> 00:36:15,910
as I Rollerbladed past in spandex...

663
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:21,082
...I feel like I'm being stalked
by some pathetic, middle-aged ghoul.

664
00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:24,210
I just... Obviously,
I've gotta break it off with her.

665
00:36:24,418 --> 00:36:28,964
Oh, gosh, I'm so sorry, Niles.
You gonna tell her now?

666
00:36:29,215 --> 00:36:31,175
No, no, no,
I'll arrange to meet her after work.

667
00:36:31,425 --> 00:36:34,178
Tell you the truth,
I think she's losing interest herself.

668
00:36:34,387 --> 00:36:36,722
I couldn't help notice
a little eye-rolling today

669
00:36:36,931 --> 00:36:40,017
when my skate wheel got stuck
in a storm grate.

670
00:36:42,436 --> 00:36:45,856
And thanks for not saying
"I told you so."

671
00:36:46,398 --> 00:36:48,943
Hey, Kit, there's something
I wanted to talk to you about later.

672
00:36:49,151 --> 00:36:51,403
Just talk to me now.
You know you can tell me anything.

673
00:36:51,654 --> 00:36:53,447
Well, yeah,
I'd rather do it after your shift.

674
00:36:53,697 --> 00:36:55,324
You have such a serious face.

675
00:36:55,532 --> 00:36:58,535
What, are we breaking up
or something?

676
00:36:58,744 --> 00:37:00,287
Well...

677
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,873
Oh, my God. You just dumped me

678
00:37:03,082 --> 00:37:05,459
right here where I work,
in front of everyone I wait on?

679
00:37:05,668 --> 00:37:08,003
- Okay, we'll go outside. It's...
- Why? Give me an answer!

680
00:37:08,253 --> 00:37:11,006
- Kit, Kit, calm down. It's all right.
- What, you're tired of me?

681
00:37:11,173 --> 00:37:12,424
- Is that what it is?
- No, no.

682
00:37:12,633 --> 00:37:14,259
- You've had enough of me?
- No, no, no.

683
00:37:14,843 --> 00:37:16,637
I gave you everything,
and you used me.

684
00:37:16,845 --> 00:37:18,889
- No, no, no, honey...
- Sex, sex, sex!

685
00:37:19,056 --> 00:37:21,892
The way you come to bed every night
wanting it, begging for it!

686
00:37:22,142 --> 00:37:24,811
- I never had to beg.
- I'm just a whore to you, aren't I?

687
00:37:25,062 --> 00:37:26,063
No, don't say that.

688
00:37:26,271 --> 00:37:29,775
Yes, I am. Your whore,
your whore from the café!

689
00:37:39,743 --> 00:37:42,829
It was really
more of a compatibility thing.

690
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:45,874
I'm recently divorced
and I've been under a lot of strain.

691
00:37:46,083 --> 00:37:47,084
Niles, no.

692
00:37:47,292 --> 00:37:50,128
- It's been painful for everyone.
- They're strangers. It's all right.

693
00:37:50,295 --> 00:37:52,506
Let's just pick this up, shall we?

694
00:37:53,882 --> 00:37:55,425
Here, you take that, I'll get this.

695
00:37:55,634 --> 00:37:57,594
- What happened?
- I'm not really sure, actually.

696
00:37:57,803 --> 00:38:00,972
- Just give me a minute, will you?
- Excuse me, is Frasier still here?

697
00:38:01,139 --> 00:38:03,892
- I had something I needed to ask him.
- Oh, yeah, he's over there.

698
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:05,810
I didn't get a chance
to meet you before.

699
00:38:06,019 --> 00:38:08,063
- I'm Faye.
- Oh, how do you do? I'm...

700
00:38:08,271 --> 00:38:12,817
No!

701
00:38:20,325 --> 00:38:22,786
Well, you know,
this is a charming little place.

702
00:38:22,994 --> 00:38:25,121
I live around the corner,
I've never been in before.

703
00:38:25,288 --> 00:38:26,414
What'll it be?

704
00:38:26,664 --> 00:38:31,836
Martini, straight up, two olives,
henceforth known as the usual.

705
00:38:34,464 --> 00:38:36,174
- Hey.
- Niles.

706
00:38:36,382 --> 00:38:37,926
I called Daphne.
She said you'd be here.

707
00:38:38,134 --> 00:38:40,595
- Oh, yeah.
- It's a cosy room.

708
00:38:40,803 --> 00:38:42,847
Guess it'll have to do,
because the old whoremonger

709
00:38:43,056 --> 00:38:45,099
won't be going back to Nervosa
any time soon.

710
00:38:46,601 --> 00:38:49,020
Yeah, I'm pretty much exiled
from Le Cigare Volant

711
00:38:49,228 --> 00:38:50,605
with Faye working there.

712
00:38:50,813 --> 00:38:53,024
- Well, I plan to get stinking tonight.
- Thank you.

713
00:38:53,232 --> 00:38:55,109
May I see your wine list?

714
00:38:58,321 --> 00:38:59,322
Hey, guys.

715
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:01,157
- Dad.
- Dad. What are you doing here?

716
00:39:01,324 --> 00:39:04,494
Oh, saw Niles' car out front,
so I thought I'd stop in for a drink.

717
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:07,497
I can't go to McGinty's anymore
with Bonnie there.

718
00:39:07,747 --> 00:39:10,249
And Eddie's taking a break
from the park.

719
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:13,044
Well, come join us here on Elba.

720
00:39:13,294 --> 00:39:15,963
- What can I get you?
- Jameson's on the rocks.

721
00:39:16,172 --> 00:39:18,382
And I'll try the white.

722
00:39:21,719 --> 00:39:27,141
Well, here we are again,
losers in love.

723
00:39:27,642 --> 00:39:31,312
Yeah. You know, I don't know
what's wrong with me.

724
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,731
I seem incapable of maintaining
a relationship.

725
00:39:33,939 --> 00:39:37,985
I date a nice girl like Faye,
things seem to be working out.

726
00:39:38,152 --> 00:39:40,362
I seem to find a way to blow it.

727
00:39:42,364 --> 00:39:44,742
Seems to be the pattern of my life.

728
00:39:44,909 --> 00:39:48,579
Well, except with Lilith.
She was just nuts.

729
00:39:50,623 --> 00:39:55,169
Well, at least you take your time.
I don't date, I leap, headfirst.

730
00:39:55,961 --> 00:39:57,046
Thank you.

731
00:39:57,254 --> 00:39:59,548
More often than not,
I get my heart broken.

732
00:39:59,757 --> 00:40:00,966
By Maris.

733
00:40:04,303 --> 00:40:06,805
By Daphne,
even if she didn't know it.

734
00:40:07,014 --> 00:40:09,850
At least Kit only broke
my box spring.

735
00:40:12,811 --> 00:40:15,814
All I can conclude is that I must have
some deeper issues with women

736
00:40:15,981 --> 00:40:18,192
that manifest themselves
in my behaviour.

737
00:40:18,358 --> 00:40:21,445
- The trick is to pinpoint them.
- Well, you know what I'm thinking?

738
00:40:21,612 --> 00:40:24,781
I'm thinking of taking some time off
and going into deep analysis.

739
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,617
That's not a bad idea, Niles.

740
00:40:26,825 --> 00:40:28,869
You know, Steven Bachman
is at the absolute pinnacle

741
00:40:29,077 --> 00:40:31,205
of psychodynamic research.
Perhaps we should see him.

742
00:40:31,455 --> 00:40:33,916
If we went in together,
we could get a rate.

743
00:40:34,166 --> 00:40:36,376
- Shouldn't take more than a year.
- That's optimistic.

744
00:40:36,543 --> 00:40:40,422
Jeez, how do you guys get up
in the morning?

745
00:40:41,715 --> 00:40:44,384
You wanna go into deep analysis?
Listen to me, I'm your father,

746
00:40:44,593 --> 00:40:46,553
there's nothing wrong
with either one of you.

747
00:40:46,928 --> 00:40:48,972
You dump a woman,
but can't get her off your mind,

748
00:40:49,181 --> 00:40:50,724
so you get dumped by the other one.

749
00:40:50,932 --> 00:40:54,102
And you should've stayed with
the first one anyway, she was hotter.

750
00:40:54,311 --> 00:40:56,354
And you, you're just learning
how to date.

751
00:40:56,563 --> 00:40:58,607
It would've been nice
if it happened 25 years ago,

752
00:40:58,815 --> 00:41:00,776
but you play the cards you're dealt.

753
00:41:01,318 --> 00:41:03,278
Me, I like Bonnie,

754
00:41:03,487 --> 00:41:07,407
Bonnie's dog humps Eddie,
I don't like Bonnie anymore.

755
00:41:08,617 --> 00:41:11,620
Doesn't mean I have issues
with women, it's just life.

756
00:41:11,828 --> 00:41:14,998
You know, good stuff happens
and bad stuff happens, that's all.

757
00:41:15,206 --> 00:41:18,627
You just gotta look on the bright side.
It's like that old song:

758
00:41:18,835 --> 00:41:21,588
<i>You gotta accentuate the positive</i>

759
00:41:22,672 --> 00:41:27,302
Maybe Dad's right.
We do tend to overanalyse things.

760
00:41:27,469 --> 00:41:31,598
- Hey, I got an idea.
- What?

761
00:41:31,848 --> 00:41:33,641
Let's go over here.
Let's do a little singing.

762
00:41:33,850 --> 00:41:35,310
- Dad, no.
- No, come on.

763
00:41:35,518 --> 00:41:37,896
Hey, buddy, can you play
"Accentuate the Positive"?

764
00:41:38,104 --> 00:41:42,484
Oh, no, I'm just noodling around.
The real pianist doesn't come till 9.

765
00:41:42,734 --> 00:41:45,028
Oh, well...
Well, you can fake it, can't you?

766
00:41:45,236 --> 00:41:48,323
Well, no, not really.
I actually only know three songs.

767
00:41:48,573 --> 00:41:51,326
"America the Beautiful,"
"Happy Birthday," and "Goldfinger."

768
00:41:51,534 --> 00:41:53,786
- That's all right, buddy.
- No, no, no, come on, guys.

769
00:41:53,995 --> 00:41:56,914
We were gonna sing a happy song,
let's sing a happy song, come on.

770
00:41:57,165 --> 00:41:58,207
Play "Goldfinger."

771
00:41:58,416 --> 00:42:00,209
- We don't know the words to that.
- No.

772
00:42:00,376 --> 00:42:02,920
You knew it when you were kids.
It'll cheer you up. Come on.

773
00:42:03,129 --> 00:42:04,338
- Hit it.
- All right.

774
00:42:12,096 --> 00:42:13,097
Goldfinger.

775
00:42:13,347 --> 00:42:15,308
<i>Goldfinger</i>

776
00:42:15,516 --> 00:42:17,477
He's the man,
the man with the Midas touch.

777
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:21,856
<i>He's the man
The man with the Midas touch</i>

778
00:42:22,064 --> 00:42:23,274
A spider's touch.

779
00:42:23,524 --> 00:42:25,318
<i>A spider's touch</i>

780
00:42:25,526 --> 00:42:26,611
Such a cold finger.

781
00:42:26,819 --> 00:42:28,613
- Dad, this is ridiculous.
- Come on, sing it.

782
00:42:28,821 --> 00:42:32,867
<i>Such a cold finger</i>

783
00:42:33,743 --> 00:42:37,663
<i>Beckons you to enter his web of sin</i>

784
00:42:37,872 --> 00:42:39,332
That's it.

785
00:42:39,498 --> 00:42:42,501
<i>But don't go in</i>
