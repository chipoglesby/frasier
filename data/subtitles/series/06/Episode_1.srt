1
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:11,803
Before we begin,
I'd like to say how honoured I am

2
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:13,639
to be taking over this spot.

3
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:16,600
Obviously, I have
some rather big shoes to fill.

4
00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:18,769
My predecessor here
was much beloved.

5
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:24,483
But I have never been one
to shrink from a challenge.

6
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:26,068
And I'm sure that we'll all enjoy

7
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:30,280
many happy years here together
in my new home.

8
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:32,741
<i>Now, today on Medical Minute,</i>

9
00:00:32,908 --> 00:00:35,285
we're going to be tackling
the sticky subject of...

10
00:00:35,494 --> 00:00:37,662
Thank you, Dr. Crane.
Great audition.

11
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:39,623
Really? That's all you need?

12
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:42,042
I think we have a good idea
what you're all about.

13
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:43,877
Excellent.

14
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:47,797
- We'll be in touch.
- I'm sure you will.

15
00:00:47,964 --> 00:00:49,299
Next, please.

16
00:00:49,507 --> 00:00:51,676
Oh, formalities. Yes, I understand.

17
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:53,845
Perhaps I'll just take a walk
around the station,

18
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:57,432
check out the dressing rooms,
introduce myself to a few people.

19
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,978
Say, you know, is there a sign-up list
for the softball team?

20
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:05,190
I'm sure that Frasier "Slugger" Crane's
gonna be an asset to this station

21
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:07,442
in more ways than one.

22
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:15,825
Morning, Frasier.

23
00:01:16,075 --> 00:01:17,410
Oh, good morning, Dad.

24
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:20,330
- Little early for the piano, isn't it?
- Yes, I'm sorry about that.

25
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:23,374
I woke up this morning thinking
about that operetta I've been writing.

26
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:25,710
You know, the one about
Robert and Elizabeth Browning.

27
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:27,879
And I think...
Well, I just had to get right to it.

28
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:30,214
Well, that's what I get for living
in a big city.

29
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:31,883
If it's not the horns waking you up,

30
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:34,385
it's someone writing an operetta
about the Brownings.

31
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:37,513
Well, I'm pretty sure
that I've solved the problem.

32
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:40,016
- Good for you.
- But I'd have to hear it to be sure.

33
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:41,225
- I'll bet.
- Dad?

34
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:42,435
- Forget it.
- Come on.

35
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:45,688
- No, I've done it once, that's enough.
- Come on, it'll just take a minute.

36
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:48,149
- I just want to do this one section.
- Oh, all right.

37
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:50,026
But I'm not doing the accent.

38
00:01:50,234 --> 00:01:52,236
That's fine.

39
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:54,906
All right, we'll take it from right here.

40
00:01:55,072 --> 00:01:56,115
- Fine.
- All right.

41
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:58,117
<i>What is it that you feel?</i>

42
00:01:58,284 --> 00:01:59,702
<i>- Love
- Love</i>

43
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:01,704
<i>That fear makes you conceal</i>

44
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:03,289
<i>- Love
- Love</i>

45
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:04,999
<i>The power's there to heal</i>

46
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:06,542
<i>- Love
- Love</i>

47
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:09,253
<i>Reveal!</i>

48
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:12,798
<i>- Take me in your arms...
- I'm not doing this.</i>

49
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:16,177
- All right, I'll sing it with Niles later.
- Oh, that'll cheer me up.

50
00:02:16,343 --> 00:02:17,928
Dad, be careful
of those sketches there.

51
00:02:18,137 --> 00:02:19,138
Sketches?

52
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:21,474
Yes, I've been planning
on redecorating the apartment.

53
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,976
I thought why not just design
my own furniture?

54
00:02:24,226 --> 00:02:27,229
Boy, Frasier, you know, you've been
taking on a lot of big projects lately.

55
00:02:27,396 --> 00:02:29,023
Well, Dad, you see, any moment

56
00:02:29,231 --> 00:02:31,275
that phone is going to ring
with another job offer,

57
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:33,611
and this blessed little hiatus
will be over.

58
00:02:33,777 --> 00:02:36,697
I want to have achieved as many
of my life's ambitions as possible.

59
00:02:36,905 --> 00:02:39,116
Gee, Dad, frankly,
you should take up a project or two.

60
00:02:39,283 --> 00:02:42,119
Me? What are you talking about?
I'm doing stuff all the time.

61
00:02:42,286 --> 00:02:44,663
Why just this weekend,
I taught Eddie a great new trick.

62
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:46,874
- Really?
- Come here, boy. Yeah, I'll show you.

63
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:49,501
It starts out: I point a gun at him.

64
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:50,878
I like it so far.

65
00:02:52,546 --> 00:02:56,508
Then I say,
"Freeze, punk, it's all over."

66
00:02:59,887 --> 00:03:02,014
It's all over.

67
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:06,560
Oh, come on, Eddie,
you're supposed to go like this.

68
00:03:06,727 --> 00:03:07,769
Well done, Dad.

69
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:11,106
Now you just have to teach Eddie
to say, "It's all over."

70
00:03:12,316 --> 00:03:14,776
- Can someone help me here?
- What is all that?

71
00:03:14,943 --> 00:03:17,112
Books Dr. Crane sent me
to get from the storage space.

72
00:03:17,279 --> 00:03:20,324
It's research I'm doing
for a novel I'm planning.

73
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:22,993
Daphne, I was beginning to wonder
what was taking you so long.

74
00:03:23,243 --> 00:03:25,996
Well, forgive me,
but I did have to move three crates,

75
00:03:26,163 --> 00:03:29,458
a rowing machine and a cast-iron
bathtub out of the way first.

76
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:32,961
Oh, look at that, the only book I really
wanted was in the shelf already.

77
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:35,464
Here, Daphne,
you'll have to take these back down.

78
00:03:35,672 --> 00:03:37,340
Oh, my God, that's my duck!

79
00:03:37,591 --> 00:03:39,134
All right. Thank you, Daphne.

80
00:03:39,301 --> 00:03:41,553
When you're done, I need you
to run some errands for me.

81
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,096
I need a very sturdy lemon zester,

82
00:03:43,263 --> 00:03:46,308
some more music paper,
some potting soil and an easel.

83
00:03:46,516 --> 00:03:48,518
Oh, be happy to.

84
00:03:48,727 --> 00:03:50,395
Then after that,
maybe I could draw a bath,

85
00:03:50,562 --> 00:03:52,314
strip you naked
and scrub you with a loofah.

86
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,816
- Would that be all right, Dr. Crane?
- Yes.

87
00:03:57,319 --> 00:04:00,071
I didn't even see you standing there.

88
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,742
- Can I talk to you about something?
- Yeah, just a second, Dad.

89
00:04:09,748 --> 00:04:11,541
Okay.

90
00:04:11,749 --> 00:04:12,792
Well, it's about Frasier.

91
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,295
Ever since he got fired,
he's been so weird.

92
00:04:15,462 --> 00:04:16,963
All these projects he's got going.

93
00:04:17,172 --> 00:04:19,799
Yeah, don't worry, it's normal.
He's simply in a state of denial.

94
00:04:20,008 --> 00:04:22,427
- Denial about what?
- About getting fired.

95
00:04:22,594 --> 00:04:25,638
People like Frasier's whole identity
revolves around their job.

96
00:04:25,805 --> 00:04:28,266
The loss of the job is like a...
Like a death.

97
00:04:28,516 --> 00:04:30,685
They cope with it the same way
they would with a death,

98
00:04:30,852 --> 00:04:33,938
by going through a series of stages.
The first one's denial.

99
00:04:34,105 --> 00:04:35,940
Usually, that's followed by anger,
then...

100
00:04:36,107 --> 00:04:39,068
I've done it!
Escoffier's most difficult dish,

101
00:04:39,277 --> 00:04:40,570
done to tangy perfection.

102
00:04:40,737 --> 00:04:42,905
You know, sometimes I think
I may have missed my calling

103
00:04:43,072 --> 00:04:44,449
not becoming a gourmet chef.

104
00:04:45,032 --> 00:04:47,994
- I see we're still in stage one.
- Hello, Niles.

105
00:04:48,202 --> 00:04:49,996
Hey, Frasier,
you ready for our squash date?

106
00:04:50,163 --> 00:04:51,205
Oh, gosh, I'm so sorry.

107
00:04:51,372 --> 00:04:53,624
I'm gonna have to cancel.
I'll be cooking all morning.

108
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:55,918
- What for?
- Actually, I'm holding a little picnic

109
00:04:56,085 --> 00:04:58,379
for the KACL employees
and their families.

110
00:04:58,588 --> 00:05:00,339
As you may recall,
I did get them all fired.

111
00:05:00,506 --> 00:05:01,591
Oh, yes.

112
00:05:01,757 --> 00:05:04,010
So I was just hoping
to make amends

113
00:05:04,176 --> 00:05:07,305
by serving up a little Duck a I'Orange
and an alfresco mea culpa.

114
00:05:07,471 --> 00:05:09,849
You know, people like chips
at a picnic too.

115
00:05:11,767 --> 00:05:13,602
Excuse me. Hello?

116
00:05:13,769 --> 00:05:14,854
Yes, Bebe.

117
00:05:15,062 --> 00:05:17,231
Yes. Yes, the television job.

118
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,774
Oh, yes, yes.

119
00:05:19,734 --> 00:05:22,403
Oh, what a relief.

120
00:05:22,528 --> 00:05:24,113
Thank you. Bye-bye.

121
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,157
- You got it?
- No, thank goodness.

122
00:05:26,407 --> 00:05:29,118
That job starts tomorrow.
I have got things to do.

123
00:05:29,326 --> 00:05:31,495
Oh, I'm sorry, Frasier.

124
00:05:31,704 --> 00:05:33,956
Sorry?
My God, you sound just like Dad.

125
00:05:34,123 --> 00:05:37,084
I am going to get another job.
The people of this city need me.

126
00:05:37,251 --> 00:05:39,628
I'm a beloved Seattle institution.

127
00:05:39,837 --> 00:05:41,005
Couple of more days like this,

128
00:05:41,171 --> 00:05:43,299
he's gonna be
in a beloved Seattle institution.

129
00:05:48,971 --> 00:05:51,890
Hey, doc. Roz.
Wait till you hear this.

130
00:05:52,057 --> 00:05:53,434
- I got a job today.
- Really?

131
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,643
- Oh, my God.
- Good, good.

132
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:56,812
- You ought to rub me for good luck.
- Where?

133
00:05:57,062 --> 00:05:59,273
Well, start on my knee.
Work your way up.

134
00:05:59,732 --> 00:06:00,899
Where's the job?

135
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:03,402
Oh, it's that new all-sports station.

136
00:06:03,569 --> 00:06:04,820
I got the breakfast slot.

137
00:06:04,987 --> 00:06:06,780
I even came up with a slogan:

138
00:06:06,947 --> 00:06:10,242
"Coffee, eggs and Bulldog."

139
00:06:10,409 --> 00:06:13,370
Sounds like some sort
of a Malaysian Happy Meal.

140
00:06:14,913 --> 00:06:17,040
A word of caution on the hummus:

141
00:06:17,207 --> 00:06:21,044
To be avoided, as a leper
would avoid a Magic Teacup ride.

142
00:06:21,253 --> 00:06:22,796
Gil, Frasier made that.

143
00:06:23,463 --> 00:06:26,842
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- It's quite all right. I understand.

144
00:06:27,009 --> 00:06:29,720
You need to flex your critical muscles
while you're between jobs.

145
00:06:29,845 --> 00:06:31,430
Oh, good.
Then you might enjoy this one:

146
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,307
After sampling your
unnuanced baba ganoush,

147
00:06:34,474 --> 00:06:37,018
I was tempted to describe
your entire Middle Eastern buffet

148
00:06:37,185 --> 00:06:39,229
as "The Sorrow and the Pita."

149
00:06:39,646 --> 00:06:42,983
Oh, who's got a pencil?
I've got to write that one down.

150
00:06:43,191 --> 00:06:44,609
- Hi, everybody.
- Oh, Tooty.

151
00:06:44,818 --> 00:06:48,071
- Hey.
- I got the most exciting news today.

152
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:51,741
<i>They just picked up my
Storytime Theatre on public television.</i>

153
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:53,410
- Hey, all right.
- That's wonderful.

154
00:06:53,618 --> 00:06:56,913
Talk about
living happily ever after, huh?

155
00:06:59,332 --> 00:07:01,835
- Hey, Dr. Crane.
- Oh, well, Kenny.

156
00:07:02,085 --> 00:07:03,712
Great party. Oh, by the way,

157
00:07:03,878 --> 00:07:06,172
I picked something up for you
on my way to work today.

158
00:07:06,548 --> 00:07:07,716
- Work?
- Yeah, yeah.

159
00:07:07,882 --> 00:07:10,009
They took me back at my old job:

160
00:07:10,176 --> 00:07:13,596
Anyway, I was passing
the bus stop and...

161
00:07:13,763 --> 00:07:15,682
Excuse me a second.

162
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,644
Anyway, they were about
to paper over your poster,

163
00:07:19,811 --> 00:07:20,895
so I peeled it off for you.

164
00:07:21,062 --> 00:07:24,107
Well, that is quite a keepsake.

165
00:07:24,315 --> 00:07:25,400
Don't mention it.

166
00:07:25,608 --> 00:07:28,778
By the way, the poster under yours
was an old radio guy, Dr. Earl?

167
00:07:28,945 --> 00:07:29,988
Who was he again?

168
00:07:30,196 --> 00:07:32,323
You know, I'm sorry, I don't recall.

169
00:07:32,532 --> 00:07:33,575
Yeah, I'm the same way.

170
00:07:33,783 --> 00:07:35,410
Once they're off the air,
who remembers?

171
00:07:37,036 --> 00:07:38,871
Do you realise
we're the only people here

172
00:07:38,997 --> 00:07:40,873
- without a job?
- Roz...

173
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,501
If we don't get this Talk 100 spot,
there may not be any left.

174
00:07:43,668 --> 00:07:46,129
Roz, I've told you
we have nothing to worry about.

175
00:07:46,337 --> 00:07:48,005
Now, come on. Everyone?

176
00:07:48,172 --> 00:07:50,174
If I could have your attention, please.

177
00:07:50,341 --> 00:07:54,137
We, of course, have planned some
activities for today's little get-together.

178
00:07:54,303 --> 00:07:56,305
And I'd like to start
with one for the children.

179
00:07:56,848 --> 00:08:01,769
Now, what we have here
is an authentic Mexican piñata.

180
00:08:01,978 --> 00:08:08,651
The object is to take the stick
and give it a little whack...

181
00:08:08,859 --> 00:08:12,238
Bravo for me.
I just got the Talk 100 job.

182
00:08:13,656 --> 00:08:17,952
Oh, well, good for you, Gil.

183
00:08:18,619 --> 00:08:23,499
Yes, you're gonna wanna give
this little fellow a good crack.

184
00:08:23,749 --> 00:08:26,210
Otherwise... You know,
maybe I better get this started for you.

185
00:08:26,377 --> 00:08:28,254
Otherwise,
the candy will never come out.

186
00:08:29,588 --> 00:08:32,925
And everybody knows
keeping something locked up inside

187
00:08:33,092 --> 00:08:37,221
is never good for anyone, is it?

188
00:08:49,275 --> 00:08:50,818
Hello?

189
00:08:51,068 --> 00:08:53,278
Yes, Bebe. We did hear the news.

190
00:08:53,445 --> 00:08:56,323
And how thrilling for Gil.

191
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:58,200
Could you hold, please?

192
00:09:08,627 --> 00:09:10,462
<i>What is this I feel?</i>

193
00:09:10,629 --> 00:09:12,422
<i>Love</i>

194
00:09:12,589 --> 00:09:14,633
<i>That fear makes me conceal</i>

195
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,426
<i>Love</i>

196
00:09:16,635 --> 00:09:17,803
Dad?

197
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:19,846
Was I doing it again?

198
00:09:20,055 --> 00:09:21,848
Was I doing it
before Mrs. Walsh got off?

199
00:09:22,057 --> 00:09:23,350
That's why Mrs. Walsh got off.

200
00:09:25,936 --> 00:09:28,272
- So how's Frasier doing?
- Oh, he's getting weirder.

201
00:09:28,438 --> 00:09:30,357
He beat up a piñata yesterday.

202
00:09:31,066 --> 00:09:32,609
Isn't that what you're supposed to do?

203
00:09:32,859 --> 00:09:33,860
Not like this.

204
00:09:34,069 --> 00:09:36,738
They found a jawbreaker
on the other side of the highway.

205
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,658
Oh, well, this is good.

206
00:09:39,825 --> 00:09:41,576
It means he's reached
the anger stage.

207
00:09:41,785 --> 00:09:43,787
In due course,
he'll go through bargaining,

208
00:09:43,995 --> 00:09:46,581
- depression and finally acceptance.
- What's bargaining?

209
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:50,168
It's like when a person makes a deal
with God to spare their life.

210
00:09:50,377 --> 00:09:53,421
Oh, yeah, I know all about that.

211
00:09:53,588 --> 00:09:55,465
I remember right after I got shot,
I said:

212
00:09:55,632 --> 00:09:58,593
"God, if I promise never to drink
another bottle of Ballantine's,

213
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,929
will you let me get through this?"

214
00:10:01,096 --> 00:10:04,641
- Dad, you still drink Ballantine's.
- Not in bottles, baby.

215
00:10:07,602 --> 00:10:11,523
You're just in time.
I'm throwing a party for my fan club.

216
00:10:11,773 --> 00:10:12,774
Here?

217
00:10:12,941 --> 00:10:16,027
Is there some problem with the bridge
they normally meet under?

218
00:10:16,861 --> 00:10:18,696
Very amusing, Niles.

219
00:10:19,114 --> 00:10:23,993
You see, I've been doing
a lot of soul-searching lately,

220
00:10:25,995 --> 00:10:32,126
and last night, I did something I haven't
done since I was a very little boy.

221
00:10:32,877 --> 00:10:38,925
I got down on my knees at my bedside,
and I prayed for guidance.

222
00:10:40,718 --> 00:10:41,844
And I asked God:

223
00:10:43,221 --> 00:10:47,475
"What can I do
to get my old life back?"

224
00:10:47,642 --> 00:10:50,061
And the answer came:

225
00:10:50,269 --> 00:10:54,315
"Take better care of your fans."

226
00:11:01,697 --> 00:11:03,825
- God told you that?
- Yes.

227
00:11:05,993 --> 00:11:08,829
I have taken my public for granted.

228
00:11:08,996 --> 00:11:13,834
I take weeks before I answer
my fan mail, if I answer it at all.

229
00:11:14,794 --> 00:11:17,088
I've been a bad celebrity.

230
00:11:18,965 --> 00:11:21,968
- But no more.
- I didn't even know you had a fan club.

231
00:11:22,093 --> 00:11:25,054
Well, actually,
they meet on the Internet,

232
00:11:25,221 --> 00:11:29,308
and I visited their website yesterday
for the first time.

233
00:11:29,475 --> 00:11:31,310
Bad celebrity.

234
00:11:32,269 --> 00:11:34,188
But I invited them all here,
and you know what?

235
00:11:34,396 --> 00:11:35,940
They were so grateful
that before long,

236
00:11:36,148 --> 00:11:37,775
I mean, God,
suddenly they were proposing

237
00:11:37,942 --> 00:11:39,652
that they hold a massive rally
in my honour

238
00:11:39,819 --> 00:11:41,487
demanding that I return
to the airwaves.

239
00:11:41,654 --> 00:11:43,572
You know, I think it's safe to say

240
00:11:43,739 --> 00:11:48,244
that someone is already working
in mysterious ways.

241
00:11:48,619 --> 00:11:51,497
Someone sure as hell is.

242
00:11:51,664 --> 00:11:53,040
Some of the crab puffs, Dr. Crane?

243
00:11:53,207 --> 00:11:55,376
No, no, thank you.
Just keep those away from me.

244
00:11:55,584 --> 00:11:57,503
Won't be long
before I'm back in the public eye,

245
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:59,213
and I've got to remain fighting trim.

246
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:01,215
- Oh, Daphne.
- What you got there?

247
00:12:01,465 --> 00:12:03,300
Just a box of Dr. Crane's
publicity photos

248
00:12:03,509 --> 00:12:05,135
from the storage cubby.

249
00:12:05,302 --> 00:12:07,721
- Thank you.
- This flashlight sure came in handy.

250
00:12:07,888 --> 00:12:11,308
Helped me to find that box
way up on the top of that old bookcase.

251
00:12:11,475 --> 00:12:13,352
And when that thing flew in my hair,

252
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:16,605
I had something
to beat it to death with.

253
00:12:19,191 --> 00:12:22,402
Oh, good Lord, our first arrivals.
God, I've got to check the food.

254
00:12:22,569 --> 00:12:24,238
Daphne,
will you run to the store for me?

255
00:12:24,404 --> 00:12:26,949
I need felt tip pens to sign
these pictures with, do you mind?

256
00:12:27,115 --> 00:12:29,868
Sure. What else have I got to do?

257
00:12:30,911 --> 00:12:33,080
Hi, Daphne. It's Daphne.

258
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,415
Hello. Have we met?

259
00:12:35,624 --> 00:12:38,543
<i>- We know you from the magazine.
- April '96, Seattle Monthly.</i>

260
00:12:38,752 --> 00:12:41,880
"At Home With Dr. Frasier Crane."
You wore an orange-flowered dress.

261
00:12:42,047 --> 00:12:43,715
And your hair was different then.

262
00:12:43,924 --> 00:12:46,760
Oh, how creepy. Do come in.

263
00:12:47,886 --> 00:12:49,846
Come in. Come in.

264
00:12:50,013 --> 00:12:53,350
- I'm Dr. Frasier Crane.
- Wow, hi.

265
00:12:53,558 --> 00:12:54,684
- Hello.
- Doris Buckley.

266
00:12:54,851 --> 00:12:55,977
- Doris.
- Aaron Fitch.

267
00:12:56,144 --> 00:12:58,438
Aaron.
Oh, it's such a pleasure to meet you.

268
00:12:58,647 --> 00:13:01,066
You know, perhaps
I should introduce these people to you.

269
00:13:01,233 --> 00:13:02,692
We know who they are.

270
00:13:02,901 --> 00:13:04,986
And now where we live.

271
00:13:06,446 --> 00:13:08,114
Oh, don't be shy.

272
00:13:08,323 --> 00:13:10,033
- Come in, come in.
- This is great.

273
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,618
This is great.

274
00:13:13,244 --> 00:13:15,288
I'm Dr. Frasier Crane.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

275
00:13:15,455 --> 00:13:17,874
This is great. This is great.

276
00:13:21,211 --> 00:13:24,130
It's cool, isn't it?
Your brother having his own club.

277
00:13:24,631 --> 00:13:29,344
Yeah, well, seeing all of you,
I sort of wish I had a club myself.

278
00:13:32,222 --> 00:13:34,432
You know, perhaps
you'd like to fill out these nametags.

279
00:13:34,599 --> 00:13:37,393
- We'll wait for everyone else to come.
- Who else is coming?

280
00:13:37,602 --> 00:13:41,397
- Well, the rest of the fan club.
- This is the fan club, the three of us.

281
00:13:41,606 --> 00:13:44,484
Well, I'll be off
to get those pens now.

282
00:13:47,445 --> 00:13:50,073
You know, perhaps you should
all help yourself to some food.

283
00:13:50,239 --> 00:13:54,035
Niles, may I have
a word with you, please?

284
00:13:55,745 --> 00:13:57,705
Niles!

285
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:05,379
I can't let them hold that rally.
Three kooks marching in a circle.

286
00:14:05,546 --> 00:14:09,300
- Do you know what that will do?
- Make them very dizzy very fast.

287
00:14:09,509 --> 00:14:10,551
Make me a laughingstock.

288
00:14:10,718 --> 00:14:13,054
I'll never work in this town again.
I've got to stop them.

289
00:14:13,262 --> 00:14:16,432
Sorry to interrupt,
but I need to carve the second turkey.

290
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:19,060
No fighting
over drumsticks at this party.

291
00:14:19,227 --> 00:14:20,311
Stop it.

292
00:14:20,895 --> 00:14:21,938
How's everyone out here?

293
00:14:22,188 --> 00:14:23,898
Great.
We were just talking about the rally.

294
00:14:24,106 --> 00:14:26,901
- Really? I'm glad you brought that up.
- They had it this afternoon.

295
00:14:27,151 --> 00:14:29,362
- In front of city hall.
- It couldn't have gone better.

296
00:14:29,528 --> 00:14:33,407
George stopped traffic by lying across
the road on a psychiatrist's couch.

297
00:14:33,574 --> 00:14:36,077
- The cameramen sure loved that.
- Cameramen?

298
00:14:36,285 --> 00:14:38,746
What are we doing?
It's almost time for the 6:00 news.

299
00:14:38,913 --> 00:14:40,498
You're gonna love this, Dr. Crane.

300
00:14:40,664 --> 00:14:42,500
- What have you got there?
- The crab puffs.

301
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:46,086
- Shall I get you something else?
- Yes, please, bring me spring rolls.

302
00:14:47,129 --> 00:14:50,049
<i>Now, on the lighter side,
did you ever ask yourself</i>

303
00:14:50,216 --> 00:14:52,927
<i>what if they held a rally
and nobody came?</i>

304
00:14:54,637 --> 00:14:57,973
This is great. This is great.

305
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:01,435
Eighty-six the spring rolls.
Bring me the freaking turkey.

306
00:15:10,319 --> 00:15:12,029
- Frasier?
- Yeah, Dad.

307
00:15:12,196 --> 00:15:14,490
You think we could talk
for a second in the living room?

308
00:15:14,656 --> 00:15:17,993
Yeah, sure.
Gee, sounds kind of serious.

309
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,622
- Yeah, it is, kind of.
- Well, what is it?

310
00:15:22,414 --> 00:15:24,708
Oh, Roz, I didn't hear you come in.

311
00:15:24,917 --> 00:15:27,419
I think you had the blender going.

312
00:15:28,545 --> 00:15:33,634
Frasier, we were wondering,
do you think you might be depressed?

313
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,843
Depressed?

314
00:15:35,052 --> 00:15:38,180
Well, we've all noticed
that you've put on weight lately.

315
00:15:38,972 --> 00:15:41,933
We're worried
that you might be eating obsessively.

316
00:15:42,142 --> 00:15:45,103
Maybe I've gained a pound or two,
but it's nothing I can't handle.

317
00:15:45,312 --> 00:15:47,314
So you think you've got
everything under control?

318
00:15:47,564 --> 00:15:50,067
- Absolutely.
- It's time, Roz.

319
00:15:50,275 --> 00:15:53,111
Remember when I had that babysitter
who was stealing from me,

320
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:55,238
so I had to put in
the hidden camera?

321
00:15:55,739 --> 00:15:56,782
Yes.

322
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:59,117
And you remember
when you babysat for me?

323
00:15:59,284 --> 00:16:02,996
- What about it?
- Just watch this.

324
00:16:03,413 --> 00:16:06,374
<i>Well, I think it's mealtime,
baby Alice.</i>

325
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:09,044
<i>Let's see what's on tonight's menu.</i>

326
00:16:09,252 --> 00:16:12,672
<i>Oh, yes, strained beef
and lima beans.</i>

327
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:15,884
All right, point taken,
I've put on a pound or two.

328
00:16:16,092 --> 00:16:18,803
But the camera adds ten.

329
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:20,388
<i>Open up. Come on.</i>

330
00:16:20,764 --> 00:16:22,932
<i>Come on, come on.</i>

331
00:16:23,141 --> 00:16:26,728
<i>You know, it's very good.
Here, I'll show you, here.</i>

332
00:16:28,605 --> 00:16:30,815
<i>Oh, my.
All right, now it's your turn.</i>

333
00:16:30,982 --> 00:16:33,610
<i>Now, come on. No?</i>

334
00:16:33,818 --> 00:16:36,780
<i>Still? Well, you know,
that's not even a proper spoonful.</i>

335
00:16:36,946 --> 00:16:39,407
<i>Let's get you a full one.</i>

336
00:16:41,034 --> 00:16:42,076
<i>That's a nice big one.</i>

337
00:16:42,285 --> 00:16:45,580
<i>You know what?
Let's try something else.</i>

338
00:16:45,747 --> 00:16:48,833
<i>How about some puréed chicken
and yams?</i>

339
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,211
<i>This looks very good.
Now, here we are.</i>

340
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:58,092
<i>All right, here we go.
Come on, open up, open up.</i>

341
00:16:58,217 --> 00:17:01,220
<i>No? Well, if you're not hungry,
you're not hungry.</i>

342
00:17:01,888 --> 00:17:03,181
<i>Oh, my.</i>

343
00:17:03,347 --> 00:17:08,311
<i>Wow, it's actually pretty good
together. Let's try that.</i>

344
00:17:10,605 --> 00:17:12,774
<i>What's that you have
in your sippy cup there?</i>

345
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:15,860
<i>- Is that apple juice?
- Oh, all right, enough, turn it off.</i>

346
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:18,654
Well, I guess maybe you're right.
I am depressed.

347
00:17:18,821 --> 00:17:19,864
What of it?

348
00:17:20,072 --> 00:17:23,451
Well, we're just trying to help you
to get to, you know, the next stage.

349
00:17:23,868 --> 00:17:26,829
- Stage of what?
- Frasier...

350
00:17:27,538 --> 00:17:30,708
...you're dealing with the loss of your
job as many people do with a death.

351
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:33,002
Only you've got yourself
stalled in depression.

352
00:17:33,169 --> 00:17:34,628
And I think you're gonna stay there

353
00:17:34,795 --> 00:17:38,466
until you let yourself grieve
for everything you've lost.

354
00:17:38,966 --> 00:17:44,805
Your job, your friends.
The money, your reputation...

355
00:17:46,557 --> 00:17:48,309
You've gotta let it out, Frasier.

356
00:17:50,019 --> 00:17:53,189
Well, I thank you all
very much for your concern,

357
00:17:53,355 --> 00:17:54,398
but you know what?

358
00:17:54,607 --> 00:17:58,819
If I was repressing anything,
I would certainly know it.

359
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:02,281
The only thing I need to let out

360
00:18:02,489 --> 00:18:05,409
are these so-called
big-and-tall lounge pants.

361
00:18:07,328 --> 00:18:09,079
- Well, that went well.
- Yeah.

362
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:11,665
- Well, we gave it a shot.
- What will we do now?

363
00:18:11,832 --> 00:18:14,543
Well, we can't push him.
If he's not ready, he's not ready.

364
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:19,548
- What was that?
- Was that Frasier?

365
00:18:19,757 --> 00:18:21,383
If anyone's hungry,

366
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:24,803
there's a freshly made
Monte Cristo in the waffle press.

367
00:18:25,012 --> 00:18:26,847
Oh, great. Thanks, Fras.

368
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:30,726
Dr. Crane, you all right?

369
00:18:31,518 --> 00:18:33,520
- Yes.
- Are you sure?

370
00:18:33,729 --> 00:18:34,938
I'm quite sure.

371
00:18:37,482 --> 00:18:42,029
Frasier, you're not famous anymore.

372
00:18:45,574 --> 00:18:48,452
- What the hell did you do that for?
- No, no, Dad, he needed a push.

373
00:18:48,618 --> 00:18:49,661
Yeah? Well, look at him.

374
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:51,371
- This can't be good.
- No, it is good.

375
00:18:51,538 --> 00:18:52,956
Let it all out, Frasier.

376
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:55,167
Let it all out. That's good.
That's right, Frasier.

377
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:57,044
Let it out. Okay.

378
00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:00,338
Okay. All right.

379
00:19:01,089 --> 00:19:03,675
Yeah, I think
that's probably enough now.

380
00:19:03,884 --> 00:19:05,302
Okay.

381
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:07,137
- How much more can be in there?
- Okay.

382
00:19:08,555 --> 00:19:10,307
Okay. All right.

383
00:19:10,473 --> 00:19:12,684
Yeah, that's probably enough now.

384
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:15,353
Okay.
I don't think I can get him to stop.

385
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,647
- But this is sickening.
- Yeah, what are we gonna do?

386
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:20,984
Somebody get
that Monte Cristo in here.

387
00:19:22,027 --> 00:19:24,779
Frasier, it's all
in how you look at things.

388
00:19:24,946 --> 00:19:26,698
Look at my life.

389
00:19:26,865 --> 00:19:29,993
No career, no relationship,
no hope...

390
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,911
You can say
the same thing about me.

391
00:19:32,078 --> 00:19:35,915
I was talking about you.

392
00:19:36,499 --> 00:19:39,878
Dr. Crane,
my Grammy Moon had a saying...

393
00:19:40,795 --> 00:19:42,255
What are you trying to do, kill him?

394
00:19:43,047 --> 00:19:46,050
Well, don't blame this on me.
She brought the bloody tape over.

395
00:19:46,217 --> 00:19:48,761
Oh, so now this is all my fault.
You saw that tape.

396
00:19:49,012 --> 00:19:51,806
I've seen your baby too.
She could stand to miss a meal or two.

397
00:19:52,056 --> 00:19:53,558
- She's a healthy baby.
- Oh, stop it.

398
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:57,812
Stop it, all of you.
There is no hope.

399
00:19:58,021 --> 00:20:02,483
It's over. It's all over.

400
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:08,406
Well, look at that.

401
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:11,367
I'm so proud of you, boy.

402
00:20:11,868 --> 00:20:13,619
Dad, you're just saying that.

403
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:24,547
- Hello, Niles.
- Frasier, please join me.

404
00:20:24,714 --> 00:20:26,007
Thank you very much.

405
00:20:26,174 --> 00:20:27,592
- I would love to have...
- Wait.

406
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,803
Mochaccino, extra whipped cream
and a Linzer Torte, right?

407
00:20:31,387 --> 00:20:33,180
Not anymore.

408
00:20:33,347 --> 00:20:35,933
I'll just have a non-fat latte, please.

409
00:20:36,392 --> 00:20:40,062
- Hey, didn't you used to...?
- Yes, yes, I used to be on the radio.

410
00:20:40,229 --> 00:20:42,732
With any luck, I will be again.

411
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,734
Thank you for remembering.
It does help.

412
00:20:44,984 --> 00:20:48,070
I was just gonna say, didn't you also
used to get a bear claw?

413
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:52,825
Off you go.

414
00:20:54,243 --> 00:20:56,829
Well, Frasier,
I just have to say bravo.

415
00:20:57,455 --> 00:20:58,789
You're slim, well-adjusted.

416
00:20:58,956 --> 00:21:00,916
You've really turned things around,
haven't you?

417
00:21:01,167 --> 00:21:05,254
Well, it's easy once you hit
rock bottom and bounce.

418
00:21:07,464 --> 00:21:10,801
Thank you, Niles,
I couldn't have done it without you.

419
00:21:11,844 --> 00:21:13,679
I did nothing
you wouldn't have done for me.

420
00:21:14,763 --> 00:21:16,265
And you'll be happy to know

421
00:21:16,515 --> 00:21:18,225
my own life
is on quite the upswing as well.

422
00:21:18,392 --> 00:21:19,476
Really?

423
00:21:19,643 --> 00:21:22,062
I just got back from a meeting
with Maris and her lawyers.

424
00:21:22,271 --> 00:21:23,313
Oh, and?

425
00:21:24,106 --> 00:21:27,443
I think this divorce
is going to go very smoothly.
