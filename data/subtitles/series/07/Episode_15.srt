1
00:00:08,908 --> 00:00:10,310
ROZ:
Hey, Martin.

2
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:11,745
Happy Valentine's Day.

3
00:00:11,745 --> 00:00:13,146
Oh, thanks, Roz.

4
00:00:13,146 --> 00:00:15,181
So, you're with us
tonight, huh?

5
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:17,550
Yeah. We rented a couple
of sad chick movies.

6
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:18,952
Oh, it's not like you
not to have a date

7
00:00:18,952 --> 00:00:20,787
on Valentine's Day.

8
00:00:20,787 --> 00:00:22,922
Tell me. I usually try
for a second seating.

9
00:00:22,922 --> 00:00:24,724
(chuckles)

10
00:00:24,724 --> 00:00:25,525
And you'd think
that being engaged,

11
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:27,961
I'd have a guaranteed date,
but no...

12
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:29,796
Donny had to
go to Florida.

13
00:00:29,796 --> 00:00:30,797
His grandmother.

14
00:00:30,797 --> 00:00:32,665
She'd do anything
to come between us.

15
00:00:32,665 --> 00:00:33,900
Oh, what'd she do this time?

16
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,502
She died.

17
00:00:37,804 --> 00:00:39,305
Good Lord,
where is Niles?

18
00:00:39,305 --> 00:00:41,107
I don't want to be late
for the opera.

19
00:00:41,107 --> 00:00:43,376
Are you going out with Niles
on Valentine's Day?

20
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:45,712
Well, it's a subscription
series, you see.

21
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:47,080
We got these tickets
months ago.

22
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,481
We had no idea
what day this fell on.

23
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:50,884
So Dr. Crane's not spending
tonight with Mel?

24
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:52,786
FRASIER:
No. She's going
out of town.

25
00:00:52,786 --> 00:00:54,487
Some sort of medical conference.
(doorbell rings)

26
00:00:54,487 --> 00:00:56,723
You know, actually,
I'm sorry for Niles,

27
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:59,225
but, uh, I'm rather glad
to be having

28
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:01,094
an old-fashioned
boys' night out.

29
00:01:01,094 --> 00:01:02,962
I can't wait, either.

30
00:01:02,962 --> 00:01:04,964
I-I'll see you
in 20 minutes, valentine.

31
00:01:04,964 --> 00:01:07,467
(kissing sound)

32
00:01:07,967 --> 00:01:09,436
That had better be
the seat duster

33
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:10,437
in our opera box.

34
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:11,738
Oh...

35
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:12,472
No, it was Mel.

36
00:01:12,472 --> 00:01:15,408
At the last minute, she decided
to skip her conference.

37
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:18,778
So... I'll be going
to the opera by myself.

38
00:01:18,778 --> 00:01:20,713
Oh! Well, here's a thought:

39
00:01:20,713 --> 00:01:22,215
If you give Mel
your opera ticket,

40
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:23,116
then you won't have
to be alone.

41
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:25,585
You can stay here
and-and watch fun movies

42
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:27,087
with Roz and Daphne.

43
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:28,388
Ooh.

44
00:01:28,388 --> 00:01:29,656
Dying Young.

45
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:32,559
It's a... classic.

46
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:33,760
FRASIER:
I am surprised
by your gall.

47
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,562
At the last moment,
you-you not only bail on me,

48
00:01:35,562 --> 00:01:37,030
you expect me to give up
my own ticket?!

49
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:38,465
Please, Frasier,
put yourself in my shoes.

50
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:40,033
Ihaveto do something for Mel.

51
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:42,035
Every restaurant in town's
been booked for weeks.

52
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:44,003
I ran into Archie
Wilfong today.

53
00:01:44,003 --> 00:01:46,506
He told me he had to settle
for two seats at the counter

54
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:48,508
at The Salad Experience.

55
00:01:49,008 --> 00:01:50,877
What would you suggest I do?

56
00:01:50,877 --> 00:01:54,013
Bring your own wine
and order the spicy Caesar.

57
00:01:56,015 --> 00:01:59,052
May your opera box
be full of cellophane crinklers

58
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:01,054
and the stage swarming
with standbys.

59
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:02,522
Get out!

60
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:07,460
He goes too far.

61
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,928
Yeah, some nerve--

62
00:02:08,928 --> 00:02:10,396
ditching you
to spend Valentine's Day

63
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:11,397
with his girlfriend.

64
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:12,732
Look, Fras,

65
00:02:12,732 --> 00:02:13,533
I don't blame
you for being

66
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:15,034
a little jealous 'cause
he's got someone,

67
00:02:15,034 --> 00:02:16,536
and you don't...
I am not
jealous, Dad.

68
00:02:16,536 --> 00:02:17,504
I am simply
appalled

69
00:02:17,504 --> 00:02:18,471
by his rudeness.

70
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:19,973
I was looking forward
to this evening.

71
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:22,976
Nice drink...
lovely opera...

72
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:25,478
then a late supper...

73
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:27,480
perhaps a beautiful bottle
of wine,

74
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,484
and a delightful...
dessert souffle...

75
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:34,821
Oh, God, I need a woman.

76
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:37,090
Remember
my friend Rowena?

77
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:40,059
She's much prettier
since her surgery.

78
00:02:40,059 --> 00:02:41,060
You look at her face,

79
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,363
and you can't even tell
where it used to be.

80
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:46,599
Thank you, Daphne,
but, uh...

81
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:48,301
actually, I
already have

82
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:50,603
someone in mind, you see.

83
00:02:50,603 --> 00:02:52,605
There's a stunning woman

84
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:55,108
who comes to the opera
on the same nights we do.

85
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:57,610
She has the box
right across from ours.

86
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:00,079
We've flirted a bit
from a distance.

87
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:02,982
I have laughed with
her during Figaro,

88
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:05,351
and I've cried with her
during Tosca.

89
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:06,853
I even had a dream
about her

90
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:09,756
during "Einstein
on the Beach."

91
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:11,624
Well, don't just stare
at her, make a move.

92
00:03:11,624 --> 00:03:12,892
FRASIER:
I will, Roz!

93
00:03:12,892 --> 00:03:13,693
Tonight's the night.

94
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:15,695
By the finale,
I'll have made my overture.

95
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:16,696
Dad, would you please come
with me?

96
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:17,697
To the opera?
Please?

97
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:18,698
What do you
need me for?

98
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:20,200
Dad, look, I-I can't go
with a woman

99
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,201
because then she'll think
I'm on a date,

100
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,469
and if I go alone, she'll think
I couldn't get a date.

101
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:24,704
You would look
pretty pathetic.

102
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,139
Oh, geez.

103
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:27,106
Or you can stay
home with us

104
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:28,575
and watch sad movies.

105
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:29,509
Sophie's Choice.

106
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:32,011
I'll say it is.

107
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:38,017
(crowd murmuring)
MARTIN:
Is she here yet?

108
00:03:38,017 --> 00:03:39,018
FRASIER:
No, not yet.

109
00:03:39,018 --> 00:03:41,421
That's her box over
there-- the empty one.

110
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:43,323
Well, I'm not going to sit
through a whole opera

111
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:44,657
for some woman
who's not even here.

112
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:46,025
Oh, for God sakes, Dad,
give it a chance.

113
00:03:46,025 --> 00:03:47,026
You might actually learn
to like it

114
00:03:47,026 --> 00:03:48,394
if you'd listen to one.

115
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:49,762
Hey, your mother dragged me
to a lot of these things

116
00:03:49,762 --> 00:03:51,764
when we were dating,
and they were all stupid.

117
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:53,766
These stories make
no sense whatsoever.

118
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:55,034
Oh, that is not true.

119
00:03:55,034 --> 00:03:56,302
Oh, all right,
what's this one about?

120
00:03:56,302 --> 00:03:57,203
Well, it's about
Rigoletto--

121
00:03:57,203 --> 00:03:58,104
the hunchback jester

122
00:03:58,104 --> 00:03:59,105
in the court
of the duke.

123
00:03:59,105 --> 00:04:00,607
He has a
daughter, Gilda,

124
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:01,608
who's secretly
living with him,

125
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:03,610
but everyone thinks
that she's his mistress.

126
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:04,611
In this opening scene,

127
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:07,113
Rigoletto mocks
the duke's enemy,

128
00:04:07,113 --> 00:04:08,615
who puts a
curse on him.

129
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:10,116
A cursed hunchback
dating his daughter.

130
00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:12,619
Well, nothing screwy
so far.

131
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:15,121
He is not dating
his daughter.

132
00:04:15,121 --> 00:04:17,123
Gilda is being
courted by the duke,

133
00:04:17,123 --> 00:04:19,058
who is disguised
as a humble student.

134
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:19,959
You see, that's what I mean.

135
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,295
The whole thing's
so unrealistic.

136
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:23,763
Everybody's in love

137
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,665
and pretending to be
somebody they're not,

138
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:27,567
and they're all swooning
and gasping...

139
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:28,568
(gasps)

140
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:30,903
See, exactly.
Who acts that way?

141
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:32,205
No, Dad, Dad, she's
here, she's here,

142
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:33,139
and she's not
on a date.

143
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:34,207
That must be
her mother.

144
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:36,676
(gasps):
Wow. You're right.

145
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:39,145
She is a looker,
all right.

146
00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:40,546
All right, don't
gawk, don't gawk.

147
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:42,081
She'll notice.
Well, I thought
that was the point.

148
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:43,283
No, no, Dad.
You got to get
her attention.

149
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,117
No, Dad, Dad, please!

150
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,586
Don't wave, don't...!

151
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:48,554
Just-just keep your eye
on the stage.

152
00:04:48,554 --> 00:04:50,390
All right, but I bet you
that gets results.

153
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:53,993
Oh.
Oh.

154
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:57,096
You're right, Dad, it did.

155
00:04:57,096 --> 00:04:58,865
(gasping)

156
00:04:58,865 --> 00:05:00,867
Oh, God, I wasn't waving ather.

157
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:02,368
I was waving at the daughter.

158
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:04,170
FRASIER:
Mm-hmm.
(chuckling)

159
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,505
Well, that's not
what the mother
seems to think.

160
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:06,506
I think she likes you.

161
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:07,340
Wave back.

162
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,174
No. I don't want to.

163
00:05:08,174 --> 00:05:09,676
Come on, wave back.
(music begins)

164
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:11,177
You started it.
Wave back to her.

165
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:13,680
Aw, geez.

166
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:18,051
Hunchback's got
kind of a nice voice,

167
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:19,552
but the daughter's
kind of screechy.

168
00:05:19,552 --> 00:05:22,055
Yeah, well, she's
no Renata Tebaldi.

169
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:24,824
FRASIER:
Gosh, I don't
see them. Do you?

170
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,592
Oh, I bet you the old one's
in the ladies' room,

171
00:05:26,592 --> 00:05:28,861
putting on more war paint.

172
00:05:28,861 --> 00:05:30,096
FRASIER:
Oh, there they are.

173
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:31,597
Just try
to be nice, Dad.

174
00:05:31,597 --> 00:05:32,598
If you are rude
to the mother,

175
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:35,034
you will ruin my chances
with the daughter.

176
00:05:35,034 --> 00:05:37,403
Well, we finally meet.

177
00:05:37,403 --> 00:05:39,972
I feel like we're
practically old friends.

178
00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:40,773
Yes.

179
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:42,075
I'm Helen Browning.

180
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:43,443
This is my daughter, Emily.

181
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:44,243
Ah.
Ah.

182
00:05:44,243 --> 00:05:45,578
Hello. I'm Frasier Crane.

183
00:05:45,578 --> 00:05:47,380
Uh, this is my father,

184
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,815
Martin Crane.
Hi, how are you?

185
00:05:49,315 --> 00:05:50,283
(all greeting each other)

186
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:51,217
Uh, well, uh...

187
00:05:51,217 --> 00:05:53,453
can we get you
some champagne?

188
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:54,253
Oh, we'd love it.

189
00:05:54,253 --> 00:05:55,755
Thank you.
Let me give you
a hand.

190
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:56,756
No, Dad,
you know what, Dad?

191
00:05:56,756 --> 00:05:57,757
We can manage. Uh...

192
00:05:57,757 --> 00:05:59,258
Oh.
Why don't you two stay

193
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:00,259
and have
a nice little chat?

194
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:02,762
Okay.

195
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:04,764
Lovely production,
isn't it?

196
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:06,733
Mm...
I adore Verdi.

197
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:10,169
Oh, he's my favorite.

198
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:13,539
Though, the woman
singing Gilda's a bit off.

199
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:15,942
Mm, she's no Renata Tebaldi.

200
00:06:16,442 --> 00:06:17,410
You know,

201
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:18,845
if you like Verdi so much,

202
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:21,314
I happen to have a spare ticket
to Aida next week.

203
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:22,782
Oh, that sounds great,

204
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:24,784
but, uh, if it's a week
from tonight, I'm busy.

205
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:26,052
I'm sorry.

206
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,320
Actually, it's
next Thursday.

207
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,321
Oh! Thursd...

208
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:30,323
Oh, you know,
there's this thing

209
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:33,192
at my, uh...
uh, my wine club.

210
00:06:33,192 --> 00:06:35,595
Oh, that's all right, Martin.
We just met.

211
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:36,596
I shouldn't have asked, and...

212
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:37,997
Oh, no, no, no,
Helen,

213
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:39,399
it's got nothing
to do with you. It's me.

214
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:42,435
I'm-I'm afraid I've given you
the wrong impression of myself.

215
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:44,804
You see, the truth is, I'm...

216
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:47,673
Gay.

217
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:52,945
Uh, right. Gay.

218
00:06:52,945 --> 00:06:54,814
I thought you might be.

219
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:58,217
How many straight men
remember Renata Tebaldi?

220
00:06:58,217 --> 00:07:01,554
(chuckles):
Not many.

221
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:04,023
Well, I'm sorry
if I was too forward.

222
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:07,293
It's just that sometimes
it's so hard to meet nice men.

223
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:08,561
Tell me.

224
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:09,929
(laughs)

225
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,798
Here we are.

226
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:13,800
Uh, Dad, uh...
Thank you.

227
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,834
Actually, uh,
good news.

228
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:15,668
Emily has agreed

229
00:07:15,668 --> 00:07:17,870
to join me
for a nightcap

230
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,672
after the opera
and cast her eye

231
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:21,207
over my African
art collection.

232
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:22,175
(chimes ringing)

233
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:23,142
Oh.
Oh.

234
00:07:23,142 --> 00:07:24,577
Well, very nice
meeting you.

235
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:25,445
MARTIN:
Nice meeting you, too.

236
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:26,379
Bye.
So, I'll see
you later?

237
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:28,314
Yes.
All right.

238
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:29,782
So, how did it
go with Helen?

239
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:30,783
You didn't offend
her, did you?

240
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:31,784
No. Not at all.

241
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:34,720
Turns out
I'm not her type.

242
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,689
Well?
Opera queen.

243
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:38,191
Oh. Sorry.

244
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:40,993
Though, you know
who'd he'd be
perfect for?

245
00:07:40,993 --> 00:07:42,295
Yes!

246
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,796
You know,
he's here tonight.

247
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:45,298
I'll bring him.

248
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,666
(chimes ringing)

249
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,134
All right, Dad, we'd
better hurry up.

250
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,602
Don't want to miss
the second act.

251
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:50,603
Oh, who cares?

252
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:51,604
Just be more
goofy stuff

253
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:54,640
that never happens
in real life.

254
00:07:58,377 --> 00:08:00,546
(dramatic score playing)

255
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:03,049
How was
the opera?

256
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:05,518
Lovely. Get out.

257
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:07,019
Hey! That movie's
not over.

258
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:08,020
FRASIER:
That's too bad, Roz.

259
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,522
There's a stunning woman
on her way over here.

260
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:10,523
I don't want her thinking
I'm running

261
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:12,325
some sort of a maudlin
sorority house.

262
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,659
Now, come on.
Shake a leg.

263
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:14,627
You actually spoke
to her?

264
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:15,928
You didn't wimp out?

265
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:17,230
You have never seen me so suave.

266
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:19,198
Oh, some
Valentine's Day.

267
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:20,700
First my date
bails on me,

268
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:24,170
and now I owe Daphne
50 bucks.

269
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,605
Well, hello there.

270
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:27,607
Will you be my Ballantine?

271
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:30,543
Dad, will you go get
a glass, please?

272
00:08:30,543 --> 00:08:31,944
Oh, all right.
(doorbell rings)

273
00:08:31,944 --> 00:08:32,879
FRASIER:
And drink it quickly!

274
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:33,779
The last thing I need tonight

275
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:36,249
is some third wheel
cramping my style.

276
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:38,284
Hello.

277
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:40,720
Hello.
EMILY:
I hope you don't mind.

278
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,154
Edward here
was at the opera, too.

279
00:08:42,154 --> 00:08:43,990
He's, uh, my partner.

280
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,791
Your partner?
EDWARD:
At the gallery.

281
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:47,193
I'm also her uncle.

282
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,160
Oh. When you said, "partner,"

283
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,529
I thought you meant
romantic partner.

284
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:50,997
Oh.

285
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:52,965
Hardly.

286
00:08:52,965 --> 00:08:55,801
Well, I'm, uh... I'm Frasier.

287
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:58,471
Pleasure.
What a marvelous view!
Thank you.

288
00:08:58,471 --> 00:08:59,272
Oh.
May I?

289
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:00,773
Yes, please.

290
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:03,643
Your father.

291
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:06,579
Is he... dating
anyone at the moment?

292
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:08,981
Well, uh... no,

293
00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:09,982
but if you're thinking
about your mother,

294
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:12,485
I-I'm afraid they're not
really right for each other.

295
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:13,386
(laughs)

296
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:17,123
Yes, I know.
I meant... Edward.

297
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:20,493
Your uncle?

298
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:22,495
Yes.

299
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:24,497
And my father?

300
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:26,933
They're both single,
they love opera,

301
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:28,968
and they were both
married with kids

302
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:30,736
when they came
out of the closet.

303
00:09:31,537 --> 00:09:34,540
Your dad told my
mother all about it.

304
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,375
Oh, did he? Ah.

305
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,244
Well, she asked him out,

306
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,946
and he had to be honest
with her.

307
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:41,681
Hi there.

308
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:43,049
Yes. Nothing like
a little honesty

309
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:45,551
to diffuse
an awkward situation.

310
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:47,553
Oh. Hi there.
How are you?

311
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:48,554
Here. Let me take
your coat.

312
00:09:48,554 --> 00:09:51,057
Uh, Dad, this is Edward,
uh, Emily's uncle.

313
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:53,059
He's her partner
in her art gallery.

314
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:55,561
Uh, Edward, this is
my father, Martin.

315
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:57,063
Pleased to meet you,
Martin.

316
00:09:57,063 --> 00:09:57,897
Uh, same here.

317
00:09:57,897 --> 00:09:59,665
And my friends call me Marty.

318
00:09:59,665 --> 00:10:01,567
Then Marty it is.

319
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:03,469
(laughing)

320
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:07,073
I love what you've done
with this place.

321
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:09,575
It's the perfect blend
of sleek elegance...

322
00:10:09,575 --> 00:10:12,078
and audacious whimsy.

323
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:13,045
Oh.

324
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:14,947
You like it, huh?

325
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:16,916
You know, Edward's
my favorite name.

326
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:17,917
Really?
Yes.

327
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:19,418
I even call
my dog Eddie.

328
00:10:19,418 --> 00:10:21,420
Eddie! Yeah, see?
Here he is.

329
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,222
Oh...

330
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:24,056
A Jack Russell.

331
00:10:24,056 --> 00:10:25,524
He loves Jack
Russells.

332
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:26,859
I have three of them.

333
00:10:26,859 --> 00:10:28,227
All girls.

334
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:30,229
Oh, well, we ought
to get them together.

335
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:32,231
Who knows, maybe
a little romance
will bloom.

336
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:38,571
You know, Dad,
maybe we should go

337
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:41,073
fetch our new friends
some, uh, drinks.

338
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:43,342
EMILY:
Uh, I'd love
some white wine.

339
00:10:43,342 --> 00:10:44,110
How about you, Ed?

340
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:45,077
Why not a beer?

341
00:10:45,077 --> 00:10:48,047
Oh... a man after
my own heart.

342
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:49,048
(laughs)

343
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:53,953
Boy, you are
really something.

344
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:54,887
What?

345
00:10:54,887 --> 00:10:56,956
You actually told
Emily's mother

346
00:10:57,456 --> 00:10:58,457
that you were gay?

347
00:10:58,457 --> 00:10:59,959
Well, you said
not to offend her.

348
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:00,960
I thought that was
a pretty good way

349
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:01,894
to get her
to cool her jets

350
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:03,462
without hurting
her feelings.

351
00:11:03,462 --> 00:11:04,463
(chuckles)

352
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:06,966
Dad, there's something
you don't understand.

353
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:08,801
You see, she told Emily.

354
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:10,569
She got a problem with it?

355
00:11:10,569 --> 00:11:12,505
Oh, no, she's pretty okay
with it.

356
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:13,773
Oh.

357
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:16,075
Oh, I get it-- you're worried
she'll know I'm straight

358
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:17,009
and find out I've been lying
to her mother.

359
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:17,977
Dad...

360
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:18,978
Oh, well, don't
worry about it.

361
00:11:19,478 --> 00:11:21,981
I'll gay it up
a little.

362
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:28,187
Emily, have I told
you I love your hair?

363
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:29,221
Oh.

364
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:30,990
Thank you, Martin.

365
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:33,292
It's divine.

366
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:38,764
Frasier, these pieces
are wonderful.

367
00:11:38,764 --> 00:11:40,266
Oh.
You have exquisite taste.

368
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:42,702
Oh, he gets
that from me.

369
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:45,438
Yes, it was worth
all the hours

370
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:47,740
I dragged him around
to the museums

371
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:48,708
and the antique shops

372
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,743
and teaching
him about art

373
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:55,648
and, you know...
upholstery.

374
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,517
Were you in the arts?

375
00:11:58,517 --> 00:11:59,518
Oh, well,
actually, Ed...

376
00:11:59,518 --> 00:12:01,420
Dad was a cop.

377
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,622
Really?
Mm-hmm.

378
00:12:03,622 --> 00:12:06,792
The, uh, uniform and everything?

379
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:11,931
Yeah. In fact, uh, that's
what happened to my hip.

380
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:14,400
I took a-a-a bullet trying
to break up a robbery.

381
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,868
Yeah, I called
for backup,

382
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:16,836
but it never
showed up.

383
00:12:16,836 --> 00:12:19,171
(sighs):
Because you were gay.

384
00:12:19,171 --> 00:12:23,976
Don't think I didn't
wonder about that.

385
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:31,484
Yes, that was the day
I came out.

386
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:33,819
Lying in that alley
covered with blood,

387
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,821
a bullet in my
hip, and I said,

388
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:37,823
"That's it.
I'm gay.

389
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:38,824
"I like myself,

390
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:42,261
and I'm not living
a lie anymore."

391
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:49,535
I had exactly the same
experience when I came out.

392
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:02,281
Not exactly,
perhaps.

393
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:04,517
Yours was a bullet
in the hip.

394
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:10,122
For me, it was a Lufthansa
steward named Gunter.

395
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:12,625
What did I tell you?

396
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:13,626
I knew they'd hit it off.

397
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:17,062
Yes, I had a
feeling myself.

398
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:20,866
And you didn't say
a word, you scamp.

399
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:23,269
Uh, Frasier,
why don't you come

400
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:26,272
help me get some snacks
for everybody?

401
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:27,740
All right.

402
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:30,543
If you'll excuse us.

403
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:31,811
You didn't tell me
this was a setup.

404
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,312
Well, how blind
can you be, Dad?

405
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:34,814
He didn't seem gay
to you?

406
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,315
He's English;
they all seem gay.

407
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:37,316
Oh, Lord.

408
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,318
Well, we're just
going to have to
tell them the truth.

409
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,320
Oh, what, you found
her mother so unattractive

410
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,321
you pretended to be gay?

411
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,323
Dad, Emily is
the most fabulous woman

412
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:45,324
I have met in ages,

413
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:46,325
and if you screw
this up for me,

414
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:47,326
I will never forgive you,

415
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:48,694
so just be nice,
all right?

416
00:13:48,694 --> 00:13:50,329
Well, what if he asks me
for a date?

417
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:52,031
I have news for you:
You're on a date.

418
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:55,467
Daphne.
We've just been chatting

419
00:13:55,968 --> 00:13:58,470
with your delightful
physical therapist, Marty.

420
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:00,706
Oh, he's a charmer,
this one.

421
00:14:00,706 --> 00:14:02,341
Now aren't you
glad you went

422
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:03,108
to the opera?

423
00:14:03,108 --> 00:14:05,077
I keep telling him
he should get out more,

424
00:14:05,077 --> 00:14:05,911
meet people.

425
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:07,780
Most nights
he just sits here alone

426
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:08,714
watching the telly.

427
00:14:08,714 --> 00:14:10,649
He's the exact same way.

428
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:12,151
He'll watch anything.
Yeah.

429
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:13,986
With him, it's
mostly sports.

430
00:14:13,986 --> 00:14:15,754
Just give him a bunch
of sweaty men

431
00:14:15,754 --> 00:14:17,156
chasing each other
around a field...

432
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:18,924
Daphne.

433
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:20,826
Excuse me.

434
00:14:20,826 --> 00:14:23,329
Where are we, uh, keeping
the Camembert these days?

435
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:24,330
Same place
we always do.

436
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:25,664
(under breath):
Get in the kitchen.

437
00:14:25,664 --> 00:14:27,666
You were smart
to hire a woman

438
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:28,667
for physical therapy.

439
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:31,036
Much safer than a man.

440
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:32,404
Edward sprained
his leg last year...

441
00:14:32,404 --> 00:14:33,272
All right, Emily.

442
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:35,174
I never trusted
that man.

443
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:36,175
All right, Emily.

444
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:37,676
And why you loaned
him your boat...

445
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:40,045
(under breath):
All right, Emily!

446
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:44,183
(Daphne laughing)

447
00:14:48,487 --> 00:14:49,989
Here we are.

448
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:50,890
Thank you,
Frasier.

449
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,691
I would love to see

450
00:14:52,691 --> 00:14:55,694
the rest of the apartment,
if it's no trouble.

451
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:58,063
Why, that's no
trouble at all.

452
00:14:58,063 --> 00:14:59,798
Uh, Frasier, can-can I just...
Now, Dad,

453
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:00,799
don't worry.

454
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:02,801
I will close the door
to your room.

455
00:15:02,801 --> 00:15:04,803
You should see him whenever
he gets ready for the opera.

456
00:15:04,803 --> 00:15:07,172
Clothes everywhere.

457
00:15:08,874 --> 00:15:10,209
Well, I'm off to bed.

458
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:11,644
Oh, no, no, no.
Uh, Daph!

459
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:13,145
Uh, Daphne,
why don't you join us?

460
00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:14,480
Oh, no, no, no.

461
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,815
Three's a crowd.

462
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:22,588
So...

463
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:23,889
(both laughing)

464
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:26,191
So...

465
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:29,361
Our loved ones seemed determined
to thrust us together.

466
00:15:29,361 --> 00:15:31,764
Well, don't let
them pressure you.

467
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:34,833
Oh.

468
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:38,537
Congratulations, Marty,
on having raised

469
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:40,306
such a splendid son.

470
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:43,309
Oh.
I envy you your bond.

471
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:46,211
Uh, you have kids?

472
00:15:46,211 --> 00:15:47,713
Just one.

473
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:51,050
George. He's 35...

474
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:54,320
and he has consecrated
his life to bowling.

475
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,688
Oh.

476
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:57,589
I join him
when I can, but...

477
00:15:57,589 --> 00:15:58,590
You're not
wild about it.

478
00:15:58,590 --> 00:15:59,992
No. I mean...

479
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:02,361
the shoes.

480
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:03,829
(Martin laughs)

481
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:05,631
Strange, isn't it,

482
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,366
the-the things we'll do
to be close to our children?

483
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:08,767
Oh, yeah.

484
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:10,269
I've let Frasier drag me

485
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:12,271
to all kinds of places
I didn't want to go to

486
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:14,106
just so that I could
spend some time with him.

487
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:15,441
You know, sometimes,

488
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:17,943
it's hard to humor
your kids, but...

489
00:16:17,943 --> 00:16:19,945
It's what we do.

490
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:20,946
We're fathers.

491
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:22,448
Exactly.

492
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:24,283
Marty...

493
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:26,752
would you be free
for dinner sometime?

494
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:30,522
Oh, gee, I, uh...

495
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:31,824
It's all right.
Never mind.

496
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,826
No, no, no, no, I-I-I
mean, I'd love to.

497
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:34,827
It's just that, uh...

498
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,328
No need to explain.

499
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:37,763
No, no, really, Ed,

500
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:39,198
it's not you--
you're a great guy.

501
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:44,603
It's just that I'm...
dating someone.

502
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:48,707
Marty, you don't have
to spare my feelings.

503
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:50,275
No, no, really, it's true.

504
00:16:50,275 --> 00:16:52,044
Hello.
Darling!

505
00:17:00,252 --> 00:17:01,253
Sorry.

506
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:02,654
Am I interrupting
something?

507
00:17:02,654 --> 00:17:04,056
Oh, not a thing, honey.

508
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:06,392
Just take off your coat
and stay a while.

509
00:17:09,128 --> 00:17:09,962
Okay, um...

510
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:11,797
I, uh, I felt bad

511
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:13,298
about that
squabble earlier,

512
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:15,300
so I thought
I'd drop off

513
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:16,668
this little
peace offering.

514
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:17,503
(laughs)

515
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:20,806
As if I could stay mad
at you.

516
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:24,843
Uh, Edward, uh, this is
my boyfriend, Niles.

517
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:28,347
Uh... Niles, uh,
this is Edward.

518
00:17:28,847 --> 00:17:29,848
We met at the opera
tonight.

519
00:17:29,848 --> 00:17:31,316
Delighted.
Hello.

520
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:32,251
You needn't look
so startled.

521
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:35,054
I assure you,
there's nothing funny going on.

522
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:37,890
Oh, good.

523
00:17:39,658 --> 00:17:42,928
Well, uh, why don't
we go put this on ice?

524
00:17:46,932 --> 00:17:49,401
Of course, the finest
Gilda ever sung

525
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:52,404
was by the great
Mathilde DeCagny.

526
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:53,906
I actually have
the recording.

527
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,408
I'd love to hear it.

528
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:57,743
Where's Dad?

529
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:00,079
He's in the kitchen
with his boyfriend.

530
00:18:02,014 --> 00:18:03,949
FRASIER:
Oh.

531
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:12,791
Niles, what
brings you here?

532
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:14,760
Well, it's my place, too.

533
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:16,762
I can have company
if I want.

534
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:18,730
Emily, this is Niles.

535
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:20,666
Hello.
Hi.

536
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:21,467
Um...

537
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:22,801
I didn't realize

538
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:24,303
your father
was seeing someone.

539
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:25,804
Well, actually, I-I
didn't think he was.

540
00:18:25,804 --> 00:18:29,308
Um... since when
are you two an item?

541
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:30,576
MARTIN:
Oh.

542
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:31,844
Few weeks now.

543
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:33,846
We-we didn't say anything
about it yet,

544
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:37,816
because... well...

545
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:40,819
So many reasons.

546
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:41,854
You know,

547
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:43,288
it's getting late, Emily.

548
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:44,289
EMILY:
Oh, yes.

549
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:45,290
We should be going.

550
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:46,291
No, no, please, please,

551
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:47,292
stay for just
five more minutes.

552
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,795
I-I have a very special
old port

553
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,797
that I'd love
for you to sample.

554
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,298
(whispering):
Niles.

555
00:18:57,236 --> 00:18:58,237
How could
you do this to me?

556
00:18:58,237 --> 00:18:59,738
This was not my idea.

557
00:18:59,738 --> 00:19:02,741
Niles... Emily just kissed me
in the bedroom,

558
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:04,243
and now she's leaving.

559
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:06,245
I have never been
so embarrassed in my life.

560
00:19:06,245 --> 00:19:07,212
You're embarrassed?

561
00:19:07,212 --> 00:19:11,683
They think the best I can do
is an old man with a cane.

562
00:19:14,052 --> 00:19:15,888
You have got
to fix this.

563
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:17,189
Oh, and how am I
supposed to do that?

564
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:19,925
Well, isn't it obvious?
You've got to dump Dad.

565
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:22,394
Ah, here we are.

566
00:19:22,394 --> 00:19:24,163
You really must

567
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,430
try this.

568
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:26,431
Thank you.

569
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:27,933
Mm-hmm.

570
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:29,368
So, Niles,
you actually,

571
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:32,104
uh, missed a-a splendid evening
at the opera.

572
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:32,905
Well, maybe I
can catch it

573
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:34,406
this weekend
with Mel.

574
00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:35,407
Oh, and who's Mel?

575
00:19:35,407 --> 00:19:36,909
Damn you and your
jealous questions!

576
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:38,744
You don't own me!

577
00:19:43,882 --> 00:19:45,217
MARTIN:
Niles!

578
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:46,985
I was only asking.
You're always asking,

579
00:19:46,985 --> 00:19:48,453
badgering, spying on me.

580
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:50,255
Well, I won't
be suffocated anymore.

581
00:19:50,255 --> 00:19:52,057
I'm tired of being
your trophy boy.

582
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:53,859
It's over,
you hear me? Over!

583
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:57,529
And I'm keeping the jewelry.

584
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:06,705
Oh, Dad.

585
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:09,107
I'm so sorry.

586
00:20:11,743 --> 00:20:15,581
Is there anything we can do?

587
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:17,049
No, I'll be all right. I...

588
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:20,052
I guess I always knew
it wouldn't last.

589
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,453
Marty...

590
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:23,755
the young ones never stay.

591
00:20:25,123 --> 00:20:27,526
I know what will cheer you up.

592
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:28,894
That Rigoletto recording.

593
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,395
Oh, yes, splendid.

594
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:31,396
You know, Emily,
I'd love to hear it,

595
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:32,898
but that shipment
is arriving

596
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:33,899
bright and early.

597
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,901
Oh, right.

598
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,903
Uh, Frasier,

599
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:40,372
I wish I could stay,

600
00:20:40,372 --> 00:20:42,207
but I'm Edward's ride.

601
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:44,009
FRASIER:
Yes, what a shame.

602
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:45,510
Well, I-I guess this
is good night, then.

603
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:46,979
MARTIN:
No, no, wait
a minute.

604
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:48,914
Emily, uh...

605
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,415
why don't you just
stay here with Frasier

606
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:53,252
and enjoy the music.

607
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,954
I'll give Edward a ride home.

608
00:20:55,954 --> 00:20:57,623
You would do
that, Dad?

609
00:20:58,323 --> 00:21:00,826
Happy Valentine's Day, son.

610
00:21:01,793 --> 00:21:03,595
Thanks, Dad.
All right,

611
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:04,930
good night.
Good night.

612
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,331
BOTH:
Good night.

613
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:09,801
(music playing)

614
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:13,305
It was so sweet
of your father to do that.

615
00:21:13,305 --> 00:21:17,309
He really loves you,
doesn't he?

616
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:18,810
(chuckles)

617
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:21,313
You have no idea.
