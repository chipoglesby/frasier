1
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:08,942
Oh, hi, Roz.
Oh, there
you are.

2
00:00:08,942 --> 00:00:10,443
I brought something
for Daphne.

3
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:13,013
I was just going to leave it
with the doorman.

4
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:14,414
(sobbing):
Oh...
Oh, Lord.

5
00:00:14,414 --> 00:00:16,349
Did I say something?

6
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:17,851
Well, actually,
our doorman Morrie

7
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:19,352
passed away this week.

8
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:21,354
We just got back
from the funeral.

9
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:22,355
Oh, my gosh.

10
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:23,690
I'm so sorry.

11
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,358
Is she going to be all right?

12
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:27,227
Well, uh, you know, she's been
a little high-strung all week

13
00:00:27,227 --> 00:00:28,728
even before he died.

14
00:00:28,728 --> 00:00:30,997
I guess it's just wedding stuff,
you know.

15
00:00:30,997 --> 00:00:31,765
Yeah.

16
00:00:31,765 --> 00:00:33,666
Ooh...
sorry about that.

17
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:35,935
So, you brought me something,
Roz?

18
00:00:35,935 --> 00:00:37,437
Well, yeah, I figured
you can't get married

19
00:00:37,437 --> 00:00:39,773
without wearing
something borrowed.

20
00:00:39,773 --> 00:00:42,108
Oh, what a beautiful garter.

21
00:00:42,108 --> 00:00:44,444
Look at all the lovely detail.

22
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:47,147
I especially like
the little odometer.

23
00:00:49,315 --> 00:00:50,984
(no audio)

24
00:00:50,984 --> 00:00:52,786
Thank you so much, Roz.

25
00:00:52,786 --> 00:00:55,622
Does anybody besides me
feel like a cup of coffee?

26
00:00:55,622 --> 00:00:56,823
Oh, I'll brew a pot.

27
00:00:56,823 --> 00:00:57,590
Oh, don't be silly.

28
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:58,591
I've been here enough times

29
00:00:58,591 --> 00:00:59,859
to know
how to get the coffee made.

30
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:02,062
Daphne,
make us some coffee.

31
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,229
Kidding.

32
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:05,031
(laughing)

33
00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:09,536
"The Wayside Inn."

34
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:12,038
Is this where you're having
the wedding?

35
00:01:12,038 --> 00:01:13,540
Oh, gosh,
it's just beautiful.

36
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:14,507
I hope it is.

37
00:01:14,507 --> 00:01:15,975
The planning's
been a nightmare.

38
00:01:15,975 --> 00:01:17,977
I spent an hour today
on the seating chart.

39
00:01:17,977 --> 00:01:19,446
Everyone has
some demand.

40
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:20,447
"Don't sit me
near the band."

41
00:01:20,447 --> 00:01:21,981
"You mind if I
bring a friend?"

42
00:01:21,981 --> 00:01:23,983
Oh, my God,
you can't seat me next to him.

43
00:01:23,983 --> 00:01:26,252
Exactly. Every selfish,
whiny, little de...

44
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:29,022
no, you cannot seat me
next to Tim Walsh.

45
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:31,991
I dated him all last summer
and he dumped me.

46
00:01:31,991 --> 00:01:33,993
He's going with my
bridesmaid, Annie.

47
00:01:33,993 --> 00:01:35,995
I have to seat the
bridesmaids together.

48
00:01:35,995 --> 00:01:37,430
This always happens to me.

49
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,998
Is there no place I can go

50
00:01:38,998 --> 00:01:41,468
without running
into some guy I've dated?

51
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:43,736
I was reading about
a Trappist monastery
in the Amazon

52
00:01:43,736 --> 00:01:45,939
that they somehow
built into the treetops.

53
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:48,641
Shut up, you big doily.

54
00:01:48,641 --> 00:01:50,376
This is going
to be awful.

55
00:01:50,376 --> 00:01:51,678
Here I am at a wedding

56
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:54,214
sitting next to a guy
who dumped me.

57
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:55,648
FRASIER:
Oh, come on, Roz.

58
00:01:55,648 --> 00:01:57,117
You won't be alone.

59
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,051
You'll be on the arm

60
00:01:58,051 --> 00:02:00,620
of a well-known
Seattle boulevardier

61
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,488
and radio star.

62
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:02,889
Frasier,
I can't go with you.

63
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:05,391
I mean... going to a wedding
with your boss

64
00:02:05,391 --> 00:02:07,894
is like going to the prom
with your brother.

65
00:02:07,894 --> 00:02:10,396
Niles and I did not go
to the prom together!

66
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:14,400
Our dates were sick
and we went stag!

67
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:22,375
In retrospect, yes,
we should've canceled

68
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:25,678
the horse-drawn carriage,
but hindsight is 20/20.

69
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,221
(door opening)

70
00:02:35,221 --> 00:02:36,156
Hey... hey, Roz.

71
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,524
ROZ:
Hi, Martin.

72
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:39,359
I'm sorry to hear
about your friend, Morrie.

73
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:40,827
Aw, thanks.

74
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,362
Yeah, his wife just did
the nicest thing.

75
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:43,863
I guess she knew
that Eddie and I would stop by

76
00:02:43,863 --> 00:02:45,365
and shoot the breeze
with him

77
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:48,368
so, she gave us something
to remember him by.

78
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:49,869
Oh.
(chuckles)

79
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:50,870
"For Martin
and Eddie."

80
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,172
Gee, isn't
that nice?
Yeah.

81
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,840
I think it's some kind of wine.

82
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,774
Well, yes,
I'd say so.

83
00:02:54,774 --> 00:02:56,109
(gasping)

84
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:59,913
My God, Dad, this is
a 1945 Chateau Petrus.

85
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:01,214
Oh, yeah?

86
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:02,515
He got it from his uncle

87
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:03,816
who was in France
after the war.

88
00:03:03,816 --> 00:03:05,952
Well, it's one of
the rarest bottles
in the world.

89
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:07,854
Well, if you're good
maybe Eddie will give you

90
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,222
a glass out of his half.

91
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,092
I've never even seen
a '45 Petrus.

92
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:14,060
Oh, poor Morrie.

93
00:03:14,594 --> 00:03:16,596
He probably waited
his whole life

94
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:19,599
for an occasion special enough
to open that bottle.

95
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,502
Perhaps this should be
a lesson for us all.

96
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:23,836
Morrie may be

97
00:03:23,836 --> 00:03:25,772
standing guard at the
door to heaven right now

98
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:30,777
but he is buzzing us
with one last message--

99
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:33,780
"Live life now."

100
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,748
I'm reminded
of a parable...

101
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:36,616
(knocking)

102
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:38,818
Come in.
Come in.
Come in.

103
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:40,720
Simon!

104
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,721
Hi, Sis.

105
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,623
I thought you were
in California.

106
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:47,060
Yeah, well, those friends I went
to surprise were out of town.

107
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,062
So, I decided to house-sit
for them,

108
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:52,565
which was lovely,
till they came home last night.

109
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:55,068
I don't know what
all the screaming was about.

110
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,903
I was the one in the tub.

111
00:03:58,171 --> 00:04:00,073
Where should I put this bag?

112
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:02,041
Uh, by the door,
so you don't forget
it when you leave.

113
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:03,376
SIMON:
Right.

114
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:06,346
Well, I think I know
everybody here...

115
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:07,714
or do I?

116
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:12,285
What would your name be,
then, Miss?

117
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:14,854
Simon... you lowlife idiot.

118
00:04:14,854 --> 00:04:16,756
You made a date
with me last week

119
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:17,757
and you stood me up.

120
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:21,761
Sorry, love, I need
a bit more to go on.

121
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:24,030
Maybe this'll refresh
your memory.

122
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:26,833
Roz-- of course!

123
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,334
MARTIN (laughing):
Well...

124
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:30,603
look who's back.

125
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:31,304
Well, who's this, then?

126
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:32,872
I'd say it was Marty Crane

127
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:34,240
but he's a bit too young
and trim, eh?

128
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,074
Oh, go on.

129
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:36,909
Can I offer you a beer?

130
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:38,244
Oh, I hate to drink alone.

131
00:04:38,244 --> 00:04:39,746
Can I have a sandwich with that?

132
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:41,214
MARTIN:
Yeah.

133
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:43,716
If that beer-swilling
boomerang thinks
he's staying here

134
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:44,717
he's got another
think coming.

135
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:46,219
(phone rings)

136
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:47,220
Better get a move on.

137
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,522
He already has your address
on his duffel bag.

138
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:50,823
We better get going

139
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:52,292
if we're going
to reach the cabin by dark.

140
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,993
"Cabin"?

141
00:04:53,993 --> 00:04:56,262
Yes, Mel and I are celebrating
our six-month anniversary

142
00:04:56,262 --> 00:04:57,764
by, uh, taking
a little midweek getaway

143
00:04:57,764 --> 00:04:59,666
to her friend's country place.

144
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,100
Yes, no phones, no stress--

145
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,102
just two days
of rest and relaxation.

146
00:05:03,102 --> 00:05:04,103
I do have to pick up

147
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:06,105
a little anniversary
gift, though.

148
00:05:06,105 --> 00:05:07,106
So, give me
nine minutes

149
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:09,609
and meet me at the
northwest corner

150
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:11,611
of Pike and
Elm at 4:42.

151
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:13,112
Coming up on 4:33...

152
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:14,614
Mm-hmm,
synchronizing...

153
00:05:14,614 --> 00:05:15,548
Now. Good.

154
00:05:15,548 --> 00:05:17,016
I'm relaxing already.

155
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:17,950
Mmm...
Mmm...

156
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:20,687
SIMON:
Thank you,
Marty.

157
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:22,021
That's most
hospitable of you.

158
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:23,523
Well, you have to
have a place to stay.

159
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:24,991
Stop right there!

160
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,426
He cannot stay here.

161
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:28,361
The man is loud, ill-mannered...

162
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:29,762
and the last time

163
00:05:29,762 --> 00:05:31,164
he stayed here,
he killed a ficus tree

164
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,665
on the downstairs
neighbor's balcony

165
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:36,936
by means which are best left
to the imagination.

166
00:05:36,936 --> 00:05:39,272
Frasier, I invited
Simon to stay

167
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:40,673
in my Winnebago.

168
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:42,608
Come on, Simon.
I'll show you your new digs.

169
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:44,177
Oh, Lord, Simon,
you know, I'm sorry...

170
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:45,611
Oh, no, no, no,
forget about it.

171
00:05:45,611 --> 00:05:47,680
It's no worse
than what I was just saying

172
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,015
about you in
the kitchen.

173
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,217
(chuckling):
Good one.

174
00:05:51,217 --> 00:05:52,552
He thinks I'm joking.

175
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:54,487
(laughing)

176
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:56,255
Join me in a
sherry, Frasier?

177
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:57,523
Oh, I think I will, Niles.

178
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:59,859
You know, I
have to admit

179
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:01,694
I'm a little bit nervous
about this trip.

180
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,730
I have a feeling
Mel may make another push

181
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:04,697
for us to live together.

182
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:05,698
Oh, my.

183
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:07,200
Well, she's been bringing
it up quite a lot lately.

184
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,236
She says it's a good way
to test our relationship.

185
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:12,205
You afraid you'll discover
things about each other

186
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,206
that you won't like?

187
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,708
Oh, no, no-no-no,
we're past that stage.

188
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,243
She knows my likes
and dislikes.

189
00:06:17,243 --> 00:06:19,746
I've... become attuned
to her various quirks...

190
00:06:20,246 --> 00:06:21,047
Mm-hmm.

191
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,315
Eccentricities...

192
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:23,850
bugaboos...

193
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:24,851
Ah.

194
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:26,352
Bêtes noires...

195
00:06:26,352 --> 00:06:27,353
(chuckles)

196
00:06:27,353 --> 00:06:29,722
Night terrors...

197
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:34,026
That's the fun of being in love.

198
00:06:34,026 --> 00:06:36,829
I don't know
what's bothering me.

199
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:39,098
Is it possible
that your foot-dragging

200
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:41,100
might have anything to do

201
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,536
with some lingering feelings
for Daphne?

202
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:46,472
Frasier, uh, you must realize
I put that behind me months ago.

203
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:47,473
Just asking.

204
00:06:47,473 --> 00:06:48,741
I'm very happy with Mel.

205
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,910
Well, then, what's your problem?

206
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,812
Uh, well... let's see, uh...

207
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:55,314
I just got
through a rough divorce.

208
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:58,651
Uh, I do have a tendency
to be overly cautious.

209
00:06:58,651 --> 00:07:01,487
This could be a chance
to change all that.

210
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:03,322
So, you're in favor of it?

211
00:07:03,322 --> 00:07:04,657
Well... I've never really been

212
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:06,659
the president
of the Mel fan club,

213
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:08,494
but she does seem
to make you happy,

214
00:07:08,494 --> 00:07:10,763
and as we were reminded
this morning,

215
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:14,133
life is not to be taken
in baby steps.

216
00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:17,670
Ask not
for whom the doorman buzzes...

217
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:21,574
Thank you.

218
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:24,410
All right. That was
much-needed therapy, Frasier.

219
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:26,245
Well, Niles,
it's my pleasure.

220
00:07:26,245 --> 00:07:27,246
You are my brother.

221
00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:28,748
You get the family rate.

222
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:29,749
Hey, Niles.

223
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:31,250
Got all the way
down to the Winnebago

224
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,752
and realized I had
the wrong keys.

225
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:35,221
I'll see you guys
in a couple of days.
Bye.

226
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:37,190
You don't say, Mum?

227
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:39,058
Your phlebitis again?

228
00:07:39,058 --> 00:07:40,026
Daphne!

229
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:41,027
Oh, got to
go now, Mum.

230
00:07:41,527 --> 00:07:43,029
Dr. Crane's on the
warpath again. Bye.

231
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:44,030
Thank you.

232
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,498
Okay.

233
00:07:45,498 --> 00:07:46,933
Daph, you know,
I'm glad you're here

234
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:49,435
because I was thinking
about that wine of Morrie's.

235
00:07:49,435 --> 00:07:51,938
You know, that's something,
really, for a special occasion.

236
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:53,940
So, I'd like you to have it
for the wedding.

237
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,341
Enjoy it on your honeymoon.

238
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:57,210
(sobbing):
Oh...

239
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,711
Mr. Crane...

240
00:07:58,711 --> 00:08:00,713
Oh, oh, Daphne,
come on.
That's so sweet.

241
00:08:00,713 --> 00:08:01,681
Come on, now.

242
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:04,016
It's only a bottle
of wine.

243
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:05,885
I don't even know
much about it.

244
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:07,720
Frasier, help me out
here, will you?

245
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,556
Well, Dad, Chateau Petrus
is a premier cru Bordeaux...

246
00:08:10,556 --> 00:08:11,524
No, no...

247
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:13,493
Oh.
I-I mean
with Daphne.

248
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:14,494
There you go.

249
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:15,495
All right, Daph, oh...

250
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,830
Oh...

251
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:21,067
I'm sorry to get so
emotional like this.

252
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:22,401
It's all right.

253
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:24,904
I guess the funeral
must've really upset you.

254
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:26,339
It's not that.

255
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:30,309
Dr. Crane, I've
wanted to talk to you
about this all week

256
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:32,311
but I haven't
known what to say.

257
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:35,815
Can you promise you'll
keep this just between us?

258
00:08:35,815 --> 00:08:37,316
Of course.

259
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:39,318
It's about your brother.

260
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:41,220
You see, I know.

261
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,522
Know what?

262
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:45,791
I know about his feelings
for me.

263
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:48,160
My God!

264
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,162
How did you find out?

265
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:54,300
It's not important.

266
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,668
Somebody blabbed,
didn't they?!

267
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:57,670
Why can't people mind
their own business?

268
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:58,671
Who was
the nattering gossip?!

269
00:08:58,671 --> 00:08:59,939
Roz?! Dad?!

270
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:00,506
You.

271
00:09:00,506 --> 00:09:02,808
What?!

272
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:04,777
You were taking those pills
for your back

273
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:06,279
and you blurted it out

274
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:07,647
while I was giving you
a massage.

275
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:10,016
Oh, well, they were
very strong pills, you see...

276
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:12,018
Needless to say,
it completely took
my breath away.

277
00:09:12,518 --> 00:09:14,020
At first, I tried
to forget about it...

278
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:17,523
put it out of my mind.
Yes, well, the bottle said
to take just one, but...

279
00:09:17,523 --> 00:09:19,525
Oh, will you shut up
about those pills.

280
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:20,526
I'm sorry.

281
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:21,827
I'm sorry, Daphne.

282
00:09:21,827 --> 00:09:23,596
Anyway, after a while,

283
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:26,599
I couldn't put it
out of my mind anymore.

284
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:30,102
I find myself thinking
about him all the time.

285
00:09:30,102 --> 00:09:31,437
(sobbing)

286
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:33,239
Daphne...

287
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,740
are you saying

288
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,076
that you have feelings
for Niles?

289
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:38,411
I think I do.

290
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:39,912
Oh, I don't know.

291
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:43,416
Even if I did, he may not feel
that way about me anymore.

292
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,417
He's with Mel now.

293
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,919
I don't know what
to tell you, Daph.

294
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,921
Uh... I-I think
th-the best thing is

295
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,857
to-to try to find a way
to talk with Niles.

296
00:09:51,857 --> 00:09:54,160
That's not an easy
conversation to have.

297
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,829
It's easier now
than after you're married.

298
00:09:56,829 --> 00:09:57,663
You're right.

299
00:09:58,197 --> 00:10:00,166
I have to talk to him,
and right away.

300
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:03,202
I'm already making
myself sick over this.

301
00:10:03,202 --> 00:10:04,704
If I leave it any longer,

302
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:06,572
I'll be a complete
basket case.

303
00:10:06,572 --> 00:10:08,741
Uh, did he mention

304
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:10,109
if he was going home?

305
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:12,111
Well, uh...
(stammering)

306
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:13,613
Actually, uh,

307
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:16,115
he's-he's going somewhere...
else first.

308
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:17,917
Um...
Where?

309
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:19,385
Get you some towels

310
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:21,220
and you'll be all
set down there.
Right.

311
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:23,422
(sobbing)

312
00:10:23,422 --> 00:10:25,257
MARTIN:
Oh, geez,

313
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:27,727
Daphne, it's just
a bottle of wine.

314
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,534
(doorbell rings)

315
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:37,069
DAPHNE:
I'll get it.

316
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:47,046
Oh... Dr. Crane, I didn't
even know you'd gone out.

317
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:49,382
I thought you might be
your brother.

318
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:50,783
I went down to get the mail

319
00:10:50,783 --> 00:10:53,719
and got all these wedding gifts
for you, but don't worry--

320
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:56,288
Niles called and said he'd be
coming by this afternoon.

321
00:10:56,288 --> 00:11:00,126
I don't even know how
I'm going to begin
this conversation.

322
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:02,461
I'm sure those
chocolate chip-blackened teeth

323
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:04,463
will be a nice icebreaker.

324
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:05,898
I've been so nervous lately.

325
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:08,234
I've done nothing but stuff
me self with junk food.

326
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:09,535
(doorbell rings)

327
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:10,336
It's him.

328
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:11,837
All right, all right,
all right, fine.

329
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:12,838
You're going to be
just fine, okay?

330
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:14,807
Remember to speak
from the heart.

331
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:20,179
Mr. Crane!

332
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,047
Thanks.

333
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:22,381
Eddie started
doing his

334
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:23,683
"I-don't-know-
how-much-longer-

335
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,117
I-can-hold-this" dance,

336
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:27,353
and I just ran out
without my keys.

337
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,021
Ever see him do that dance?

338
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:32,391
Just the droll impression of it
you do at parties, Dad.

339
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:36,429
You know, Mr. Crane,
Eddie seems awful fidgety.

340
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:38,931
I don't think he got
enough exercise on that walk.

341
00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:41,901
Anybody needs any exercise, it's
you, the way you're eating now.

342
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:44,336
You know, when they put
"party size" on that cookie bag

343
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:46,906
they don't mean
"party of one."

344
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:49,408
(doorbell rings)

345
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,682
Simon, what
do you want?

346
00:11:56,682 --> 00:11:57,983
Well, I've just come
to borrow a pen

347
00:11:57,983 --> 00:12:00,886
so I could fill out
this job application.

348
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:02,254
What? Oh,
you're applying for work?

349
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:03,689
Well, here, uh, allow me.

350
00:12:03,689 --> 00:12:04,657
There we are.

351
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:06,659
Gosh, we'll miss
you around here,

352
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:08,160
but onward and upward.

353
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:09,662
So, what's the job?

354
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:12,198
Doorman.

355
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:14,133
Dear God.

356
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:17,069
Why, it's ideal for me, really.

357
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:19,071
Nice, cozy chair,
plenty of time

358
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,574
to think the long, long
thoughts of youth...

359
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:25,478
not to mention what the uniforms
do for the ladies, eh, ha-ha!

360
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:27,313
If memory serves,

361
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:29,215
a certain bellhop
back in Manchester

362
00:12:29,715 --> 00:12:32,985
found that out with a young lady
who will remain nameless.

363
00:12:32,985 --> 00:12:34,286
Simon!

364
00:12:34,286 --> 00:12:35,755
I'm this close to just
poppin' him one.

365
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:38,290
Now, now, Daphne, Daphne,
you just have to calm down.

366
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:41,093
Here. Have a cookie.

367
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:42,862
What is up with your appetite
lately?

368
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:44,764
What, you knocked up
or something?

369
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:45,631
Of course not, you...

370
00:12:45,631 --> 00:12:47,466
Now, now, you
wouldn't be

371
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:50,236
the first person in our family
to be walking down the aisle

372
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:52,238
carrying more
than just a bouquet.

373
00:12:52,238 --> 00:12:54,740
(angry muttering)
(grunting)

374
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,642
(doorbell rings)

375
00:12:56,642 --> 00:12:58,010
Uh, Simon,
why don't you

376
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:00,012
finish filling that out
in the kitchen,

377
00:13:00,012 --> 00:13:01,447
and help yourself
to a beer?

378
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:04,216
Well, great.

379
00:13:09,388 --> 00:13:10,656
Roz!

380
00:13:10,656 --> 00:13:11,957
Hi, guys.

381
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:15,561
Hey, Frasier, I felt kind
of bad about the other day

382
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:16,562
dumping you as
my wedding date...

383
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:18,063
You want me back,
don't you?

384
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:21,433
...and I'm sick about it,
but I can't find anybody else.

385
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:23,302
Sorry, Roz, I already
invited somebody else.

386
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:25,104
She's driving up on Saturday
to join me.

387
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:26,405
Get rid of her!
I need a date.

388
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:27,840
I'm desperate!

389
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:32,812
Well, well, somebody here
is singin' my favorite song.

390
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:36,182
Simon, there's
a guy who lives

391
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:38,584
in the park across
the street from me.

392
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:41,086
He wears a cat suit
and meows at people.

393
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:43,322
If he's busy,
maybe I'll call you.

394
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,124
I'm prettying myself up,
just in case.

395
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:46,625
Speaking of which, Daphne--

396
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:49,461
I borrowed your blow-dryer
for my job interview.

397
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:50,896
I spent an hour
looking for that!

398
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:52,832
I thought I was losing my mind!

399
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,800
Well, that does happen to women
in your condition--

400
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,101
you know, in a family way...

401
00:13:56,101 --> 00:13:57,236
You're pregnant?!

402
00:13:57,236 --> 00:13:59,071
I am not pregnant!

403
00:13:59,071 --> 00:14:01,540
What, just another scare, then,
like that time back in school

404
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,908
with that Pakistani chap?

405
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:05,311
That's it, you pig!

406
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,745
Ooh. Put me down.

407
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:08,747
Daphne and I are going out
for a breath of fresh air,

408
00:14:08,747 --> 00:14:10,716
perhaps to retrieve
her blow-dryer.

409
00:14:10,716 --> 00:14:12,585
Oh, if Niles should happen
to stop by, keep him here.

410
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:15,020
There's something important
I need to discuss with him.

411
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,289
Oh, for God's sake,
put me down.

412
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:19,391
Not until you promise
not to kill your brother.

413
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,726
Oh, all right.

414
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:22,561
It's not as if he
doesn't deserve it.

415
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:24,396
Telling everyone
I'm carrying Donny's baby--

416
00:14:24,396 --> 00:14:26,398
like I don't have enough
to worry about today

417
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:27,766
waiting for Dr. Crane.

418
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:30,669
Daphne, Daphne,
you have to calm down.

419
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:31,971
It's not easy.

420
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:34,340
I don't even know how
to begin with him.

421
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,876
"Would you like steak
or salmon at my wedding?

422
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:40,379
And by the way, I think
I might be in love with you."

423
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:41,881
Daphne, you'll
find the words

424
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,250
when the time
comes, all right?

425
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,151
Don't pretend you're not
listening, Mrs. Richman.

426
00:14:46,151 --> 00:14:50,155
Your laundry is not
that interesting.

427
00:14:50,155 --> 00:14:52,458
Oh, come on,
George.

428
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:54,260
I'm desperate here.

429
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,028
I promise you a good time.

430
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:57,329
I mean a really
good time,

431
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,832
if you get my drift.

432
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:03,836
You might have mentioned
I was on speaker phone.

433
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:08,974
Listen to what
you're doing, Roz.

434
00:15:08,974 --> 00:15:10,976
It's not very
dignified, is it?

435
00:15:10,976 --> 00:15:13,846
Come on, Roz, give
Simon a chance.

436
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:15,681
What, so he can
stand me up again?

437
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:17,616
And miss my sister's wedding?
Never.

438
00:15:17,616 --> 00:15:20,119
Well, if you're worried
about my appearance,

439
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:23,989
I know where I can get my hands
on some very nice Armani suits.

440
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:26,158
Or you can just grab one
out of Frasier's closet.

441
00:15:26,158 --> 00:15:28,794
What do you think
he was talking about?

442
00:15:30,162 --> 00:15:31,630
All right...

443
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:35,134
but, Simon, just remember--
my ex-boyfriend will be there.

444
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:37,670
If anybody asks,
you're an Internet millionaire.

445
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:41,540
Right. I'll be your perfect
well-bred, upmarket gentleman.

446
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,942
Now, I'll walk you
to the garage.

447
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:43,943
Oh, you don't have to.

448
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:47,279
Oh, it's no bother--
I live there.

449
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:50,115
Roz!
Niles!

450
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:51,617
Simon!

451
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:54,119
Well, by the look of
that smile on your face,

452
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:56,989
I'd say somebody got
himself a bit last night.

453
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:59,825
I find that remark
rude, boorish...

454
00:15:59,825 --> 00:16:02,194
and impossible to deny!

455
00:16:03,228 --> 00:16:05,698
Brilliant!

456
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,638
Niles, how was your trip?

457
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,139
Oh, fantastic, Dad.

458
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,140
Where's Frasier?
I have some news.

459
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,642
Oh, he'll be back
in a bit. What's up?

460
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,143
Oh, uh, well, I should
wait for Frasier.

461
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:19,645
It was really his idea.
Do you mind?

462
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,146
I can wait.
Okay.

463
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:23,649
I can't.
What is it?

464
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,884
I'm married.

465
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:29,955
Married?

466
00:16:29,955 --> 00:16:31,790
Yes. Mel and I eloped yesterday.

467
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:33,125
Well?

468
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,493
Well...

469
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,996
congratulations, son!

470
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,998
That's great.

471
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,433
So, uh, you're
happy, right?

472
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:45,304
Oh, happy? I'm delirious.

473
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:48,507
Yeah, you'd have to be,
wouldn't you?

474
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:55,781
So, uh, you say
this was Frasier's idea?

475
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:57,282
Well, indirectly, yeah.

476
00:16:57,282 --> 00:16:58,784
Oh, before I forget,
it occurred to me--

477
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:00,786
I think we should keep this
from Daphne and Donny.

478
00:17:01,286 --> 00:17:02,254
I would hate for them
to think

479
00:17:02,254 --> 00:17:04,023
that we're stealing
their thunder.

480
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,324
Oh, Niles.

481
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:06,191
Frasier.

482
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:07,993
Three guesses what
I did yesterday.
What?

483
00:17:07,993 --> 00:17:08,894
Daphne.

484
00:17:08,894 --> 00:17:10,162
Dr. Crane.

485
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:10,829
Send Daphne away.

486
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:13,065
Get rid of your father.

487
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:14,400
Daphne, could you go
to the drugstore?

488
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,901
I'm all out of liniment

489
00:17:15,901 --> 00:17:17,369
and my back's getting
kind of achy.

490
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:19,138
Dad, that's because
you've been sitting
in that chair all day.

491
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:20,439
I tell you what, you know
what you could use?

492
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:22,441
A good walk
to the drugstore.

493
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:23,442
It'll do you a world of good.

494
00:17:23,942 --> 00:17:24,943
I'll go with you.
Oh-oh, okay.
All right.

495
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:26,378
Niles, why don't
you come, too?

496
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:27,880
Yeah, we'll all go.

497
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,381
No! No, there's something
very important

498
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:31,884
I need to discuss
with Dad, Niles.

499
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,385
I'm sure you understand.

500
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:34,319
Fras!

501
00:17:36,488 --> 00:17:39,058
(phone rings)
Oh, excuse me.

502
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:42,127
Hello? Mel, darling.

503
00:17:42,127 --> 00:17:44,363
No, just hanging
out with Daphne.

504
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:46,331
Honestly, Dad, when will
you learn to take a hint?

505
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:48,167
I can't take a hint?!

506
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:49,835
Couldn't you see that Niles
wanted to talk to you?

507
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:51,070
Whatever it is,
he can wait.

508
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,104
Oh, yeah, no big deal.

509
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:53,605
He just got married,
that's all.
What?!

510
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:55,474
He eloped with Mel
yesterday.

511
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:56,642
Poor Daphne.

512
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:58,010
Would you please keep out
of this, Mrs. Richmond!

513
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:59,511
We have got to
get back up there!

514
00:17:59,511 --> 00:18:00,512
We're going
to the basement!

515
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:02,915
I can't wait that long!

516
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:08,153
See you later... darling.

517
00:18:08,153 --> 00:18:09,655
Sorry about that.

518
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:10,989
Oh, it's all right.

519
00:18:10,989 --> 00:18:15,060
So, 48 hours till the big day--
you must be pretty excited.

520
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,896
It's funny
you should mention that.

521
00:18:17,896 --> 00:18:20,232
You see, Dr. Crane...

522
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:21,567
Yes, Daphne?

523
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,435
(yelling):
Niles!

524
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:32,411
Dr. Crane! You're
back awfully soon.

525
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:34,980
And you-you're
all out of breath.

526
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,381
Is something wrong?

527
00:18:36,381 --> 00:18:38,250
Uh, no, no. It's just
that there's something

528
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,618
I need to discuss
with Niles.

529
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,487
What, now? We were
just having a chat.

530
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:43,255
Well, I'm sure it
can wait, Daphne.

531
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:44,523
Daphne, Daphne, I need
to talk to Frasier, too--

532
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:46,525
if you don't mind.
Oh, of course not.

533
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:50,496
It's not like I had anything
important to talk about!

534
00:18:52,998 --> 00:18:55,467
Daphne all right?

535
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:58,403
Well, it's just, uh,
wedding stuff, I guess.

536
00:18:58,403 --> 00:19:01,807
Uh, speaking of which,
I-I understand you have

537
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,575
some... some news?

538
00:19:03,575 --> 00:19:06,011
You're... married?

539
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:07,446
Yes. I guess Dad couldn't
contain himself

540
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:09,281
any more than I could.

541
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:11,350
I thought you were
just going to move
in together.

542
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,152
Well, so did I, but the
strangest thing happened.

543
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,120
As we talked about it,
we got more and more excited

544
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,622
about the idea
of being together,

545
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:19,091
and then I remembered
your advice

546
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:22,861
to stop taking baby
steps through life.

547
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:24,229
Before we knew it,

548
00:19:24,229 --> 00:19:25,731
we were asking the waitress
for a phone book

549
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:28,133
so we could find
a justice of the peace!

550
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:29,168
(doorbell rings)

551
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:32,137
What can I say but...
congratulations?

552
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:35,574
Martin... or should
I say Dad?

553
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:38,810
Yeah. I heard.

554
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:40,145
Hello.

555
00:19:40,145 --> 00:19:41,580
Darling, darling,
it occurred to me

556
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:44,950
I think perhaps we should try
to keep this quiet from Daphne.

557
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:46,785
Keep what quiet?

558
00:19:46,785 --> 00:19:50,122
Oh, we can't keep something
like this a secret.

559
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:51,557
We got married.

560
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:54,927
Did you?

561
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:56,762
NILES:
Yes. While we
were out of town.

562
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:59,198
But the last thing we want
is to upstage you and Donny

563
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:02,467
so we are not mentioning
this outside this room.

564
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:05,771
Well, I am just

565
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:08,273
so happy for you both.

566
00:20:08,273 --> 00:20:10,676
We're having champagne.
Would you like to join us?

567
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:13,111
I'd love to, but I have to get
a check down to the caterer's.

568
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:14,580
They're closing
early today.

569
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,081
Let me drive you
over, Daph.

570
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:17,349
Oh, no, I'm fine.

571
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:19,618
Congratulations again.

572
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:22,020
Oh, save a glass for me.

573
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:28,293
(sobbing)

574
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:43,709
This is the lounge.

575
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:45,210
Through there
is the dining area

576
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:46,778
where the rehearsal
dinner will be.

577
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:47,713
This is lovely.

578
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:49,181
Say, have you seen
the bride-to-be yet?

579
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:50,682
I'd like to have
a word with her.

580
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:51,550
No, I haven't.

581
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:53,018
So, I thought we'd
have the toast

582
00:20:53,018 --> 00:20:54,086
right before dessert.

583
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,554
Dr. Crane!

584
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:57,956
Gosh, Daphne, I was wondering
where you'd gotten to yesterday.

585
00:20:57,956 --> 00:20:59,925
After the caterers
I went straight to Donny's

586
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,860
so we could leave
bright and early together.

587
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,762
It's lovely up here,
isn't it?
Oh, yes.

588
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,764
Anybody else want something
from the bar?

589
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:06,565
Um, Scotch rocks.

590
00:21:06,565 --> 00:21:08,133
Donny, it's barely noon.

591
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:09,868
Isn't that when your mom
said she'd be here?

592
00:21:09,868 --> 00:21:11,403
Give him a double.

593
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:12,771
Um, Daphne, I was
actually hoping...

594
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:14,673
I'll have
whatever he's having.

595
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:15,674
Roz.

596
00:21:16,174 --> 00:21:17,676
I don't even know why
I came to this wedding.

597
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:18,610
Hi, Daphne.

598
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:21,446
I was all set
to drive up here myself

599
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:22,814
when I think "wait a minute.

600
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:24,316
"I can't walk
into that lobby alone.

601
00:21:24,316 --> 00:21:25,651
What if my ex-boyfriend
is here?"

602
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:27,886
So, I agreed
to drive up with Simon.

603
00:21:27,886 --> 00:21:29,254
There I am

604
00:21:29,254 --> 00:21:30,756
standing on the curb
with my garment bag

605
00:21:30,756 --> 00:21:32,257
and what does he pull up in?

606
00:21:32,257 --> 00:21:33,158
Your father's Winnebago.

607
00:21:33,158 --> 00:21:34,559
Thank you.

608
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,561
Don't go anywhere.

609
00:21:36,561 --> 00:21:39,064
Next thing I know,
we're heading down the highway

610
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:41,566
in the wrong direction
towards the airport.

611
00:21:41,566 --> 00:21:42,367
Hey...

612
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:43,468
I wasn't kidding.

613
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:45,237
Turns out he's promised

614
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:47,539
to ferry your entire family
up here.

615
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:48,874
All 14 of them?

616
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:50,208
Fifteen. Your Aunt Ida

617
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:51,710
got the weekend off
from the bakery.

618
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:53,211
Judging by the size of her,

619
00:21:53,211 --> 00:21:55,147
it'll be the first Saturday
they turn a profit.

620
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,982
You know, Donny,

621
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:58,884
maybe you could take Roz
out for a walk

622
00:21:58,884 --> 00:22:00,952
in that rejuvenating country air

623
00:22:00,952 --> 00:22:02,754
while I have a word
with your fiancee?

624
00:22:02,754 --> 00:22:04,056
Come on, Roz,
let's go.

625
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:05,357
You don't mind if I just
take this with me, do you?

626
00:22:05,357 --> 00:22:07,159
Well, uh...
I didn't think so.

627
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:09,761
Daphne, I wanted
you to know

628
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:12,764
that I'm just
completely devastated

629
00:22:12,764 --> 00:22:14,032
by what happened.

630
00:22:14,032 --> 00:22:16,068
It's all right, Dr. Crane.

631
00:22:16,068 --> 00:22:17,869
It's just when I advised you
to have a chat with Niles

632
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:20,238
I had no idea he'd run off
and get married.

633
00:22:20,238 --> 00:22:22,574
I know your concern for me,
but I'm fine.

634
00:22:22,574 --> 00:22:24,576
I thought about it
all last night,

635
00:22:24,576 --> 00:22:26,078
and I realized
what I was feeling

636
00:22:26,078 --> 00:22:28,080
was just wedding jitters.

637
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,581
I do love your brother,

638
00:22:29,581 --> 00:22:31,583
but I'm in love with Donny.

639
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:34,419
You're not just putting on
a brave face?

640
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:35,721
No.

641
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:39,491
I'm a bit embarrassed now,
making you worry for no reason.

642
00:22:39,491 --> 00:22:40,759
Oh, it's all right, Daphne.

643
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:42,160
It's what I do.

644
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:45,030
You've always been
such a wonderful friend.

645
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:48,033
In fact, I brought this
for the honeymoon,

646
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:50,335
but I'd like you to have it.

647
00:22:50,335 --> 00:22:51,103
Oh, Daphne, I couldn't.

648
00:22:51,603 --> 00:22:52,604
Donny and I
aren't wine drinkers.

649
00:22:52,604 --> 00:22:54,072
I wouldn't dream
of it. Really.

650
00:22:54,072 --> 00:22:55,006
All right, I'll keep it.

651
00:22:55,006 --> 00:22:57,409
Now I've hurt your feelings.
Here.

652
00:22:57,409 --> 00:22:58,877
Gosh, Daphne...

653
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:00,412
I tell you what.

654
00:23:00,412 --> 00:23:02,414
I promise
that when I do drink this,

655
00:23:02,414 --> 00:23:03,782
I'll be thinking of you.

656
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:05,884
Oh, come here.

657
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:08,553
Oh, Daph.

658
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:10,689
There's my baby.

659
00:23:10,689 --> 00:23:12,023
Hi, Mummy.

660
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:15,427
(both groan happily)

661
00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:16,828
Mum, this is...

662
00:23:16,828 --> 00:23:18,330
Oh, I know who he is, love.

663
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:20,332
I want to thank you, Donny,

664
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:23,702
for rescuing my daughter
from that horrible Dr. Crane.

665
00:23:23,702 --> 00:23:25,904
Well, actually...
Every time

666
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:28,707
I call her, I'm not on the phone
five minutes

667
00:23:28,707 --> 00:23:31,209
before that tyrant
is ordering her to hang up.

668
00:23:31,209 --> 00:23:32,711
Cup of tea, please.

669
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:35,714
I thought my daughter might get
me one, but she didn't.

670
00:23:37,215 --> 00:23:40,185
God, this seat's
worse than the Winnebago.

671
00:23:40,185 --> 00:23:42,220
Though not half as uncomfortable

672
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:44,156
as that sardine tin of a room

673
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:45,557
you arranged for me.

674
00:23:45,557 --> 00:23:47,559
Oh, God, can't bear
the smell of that.

675
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:48,560
Take it away.

676
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,461
Oh...

677
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:50,796
Reminds me of the salmon

678
00:23:50,796 --> 00:23:52,798
they served on the airplane.

679
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:55,200
Oh, if it doesn't have me
hurling me guts out,

680
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,169
it'll be by God's
own intervention.

681
00:23:58,637 --> 00:24:00,639
Now give your new mum a kiss,
Donny.

682
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:01,640
Oh, actually, Mum,

683
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,641
this isn't Donny.

684
00:24:02,641 --> 00:24:03,642
DONNY:
Oh, is this Mum?

685
00:24:03,642 --> 00:24:04,643
This is Donny.

686
00:24:04,643 --> 00:24:06,077
Hi.

687
00:24:06,077 --> 00:24:07,579
Well, come here.
Let's have a look at you.

688
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:10,315
We've be starting to think
our Daphne

689
00:24:10,315 --> 00:24:11,950
would never find herself
a young man.

690
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:14,386
And I see she hasn't.

691
00:24:14,386 --> 00:24:16,788
Well, beggars
can't be choosers.

692
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:18,256
Well, I'm going
to go and see

693
00:24:18,256 --> 00:24:20,759
if your father's stomach
is feeling any better.

694
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:22,694
He keeps saying it's tension.

695
00:24:22,694 --> 00:24:25,997
What he's got to be tense about,
I'll never know.

696
00:24:27,699 --> 00:24:30,936
I was worried she'd be
in one of her dark moods.

697
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:39,010
(crowd talking)

698
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:41,580
Daphne's brothers know how
to let loose, don't they?

699
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,548
MARTIN:
Boy, I'll say.
Now, listen, about their names.

700
00:24:43,548 --> 00:24:45,550
The one who'll eat anything
on a bet, that's Nigel.

701
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:47,052
No, no, that's Peter.

702
00:24:47,052 --> 00:24:49,054
Nigel's the one
whose Band-Aid he ate.

703
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:50,055
See ya.

704
00:24:50,055 --> 00:24:52,057
Hey, Fras.

705
00:24:52,057 --> 00:24:53,058
Had enough, huh?

706
00:24:53,058 --> 00:24:55,060
Oh, yeah.

707
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,561
I think I hit
my limit

708
00:24:56,561 --> 00:24:58,063
when in the middle of my toast

709
00:24:58,563 --> 00:25:00,999
I looked down and there was
a man chewing on my boutonniere.

710
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:04,503
Oh, God, it's been
a hell of a week.

711
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:07,906
I still can't get
over Niles and Mel.

712
00:25:07,906 --> 00:25:11,142
Didn't see that coming.

713
00:25:11,142 --> 00:25:12,944
Well, at least he says
she makes him happy.

714
00:25:12,944 --> 00:25:14,412
So there's nothing
you can do about it.

715
00:25:14,412 --> 00:25:16,848
Actually...

716
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:18,350
Fras, don't even think

717
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,851
about trying to talk
him out of it.

718
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:21,353
He's married.
End of story.

719
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:23,855
It's really
not that simple, Dad.

720
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:25,357
You see...

721
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:27,859
I shouldn't be talking
to you about this.

722
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:29,261
Is this about Daphne?

723
00:25:29,261 --> 00:25:31,930
Why do you say that?

724
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:32,697
Oh, come on, I got eyes.

725
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:34,199
I know something's going on.

726
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:36,001
I seen the way
she's been looking at him.

727
00:25:36,001 --> 00:25:40,405
She found out how Niles has felt
about her all these years.

728
00:25:40,405 --> 00:25:41,840
You're kidding?

729
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,775
How'd she find out?

730
00:25:43,775 --> 00:25:45,710
That's not important
right now, Dad.

731
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,178
The problem is that she told me

732
00:25:47,178 --> 00:25:49,114
that she might have
the same feelings for him.

733
00:25:49,114 --> 00:25:50,148
Oh, geez.

734
00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:53,151
Of course,
then Niles shows up married.

735
00:25:53,151 --> 00:25:55,654
Now she says
it's just jitters.

736
00:25:55,654 --> 00:25:57,656
Well, you can't
tell Niles all this.

737
00:25:57,656 --> 00:25:59,558
He says he's
happy with Mel.

738
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:01,493
She says she's happy with Donny.

739
00:26:01,493 --> 00:26:03,461
And I'm not sure I believe
either one of them.

740
00:26:03,461 --> 00:26:04,829
Just remember, Fras,

741
00:26:04,829 --> 00:26:06,665
there are two marriages
on the line here.

742
00:26:06,665 --> 00:26:08,667
So, before you get involved,
you better make damn sure

743
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:09,935
you know what you're doing.

744
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:15,674
Who blabbed? Roz?

745
00:26:15,674 --> 00:26:18,843
Yes, but she feels terrible.

746
00:26:20,011 --> 00:26:20,845
Hello, boys.

747
00:26:20,845 --> 00:26:22,247
Hey...

748
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:25,183
A pack of smokes,
please, barkeep.

749
00:26:25,183 --> 00:26:27,586
Oh, lovely spot,
isn't it?

750
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:29,988
I just took a nice
little stroll outside

751
00:26:29,988 --> 00:26:31,489
around the wishing well.

752
00:26:31,489 --> 00:26:32,457
Oh.

753
00:26:32,457 --> 00:26:33,959
That'll be four
dollars, please.

754
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:34,793
Oh, yeah, right.

755
00:26:34,793 --> 00:26:37,095
This ought to cover it.

756
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:38,863
(coins clattering)

757
00:26:40,131 --> 00:26:42,033
Tim, what a surprise.

758
00:26:42,033 --> 00:26:44,869
I had no idea
you'd be here.

759
00:26:44,869 --> 00:26:46,171
Simon...

760
00:26:46,171 --> 00:26:47,138
come here.

761
00:26:47,138 --> 00:26:49,107
Show time.

762
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:54,112
Simon, this is
my old friend Tim.

763
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:56,114
He's a computer programmer.

764
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:57,515
Oh, what a
coincidence.

765
00:26:57,515 --> 00:27:00,251
With me owning
my own software company.

766
00:27:00,251 --> 00:27:03,555
Really? What sort of
applications are you focused on?

767
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:05,557
Voice recognition,
data encryption,

768
00:27:05,557 --> 00:27:07,525
something I'm working on
for NASA.

769
00:27:07,525 --> 00:27:10,328
Can't discuss that one.

770
00:27:10,328 --> 00:27:11,630
Oh, very impressive.

771
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:12,631
And Roz, are you
still producing?

772
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:14,132
I'll say she is.

773
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:15,634
(hearty laugh)

774
00:27:17,402 --> 00:27:20,171
Excuse me.

775
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,175
Mind if we
join you guys?

776
00:27:24,175 --> 00:27:25,644
Oh, please.
Sure.

777
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:27,646
There's plenty of room.

778
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:29,147
Give me a beer, please.

779
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:30,582
Sorry we didn't
get a toast

780
00:27:30,582 --> 00:27:32,050
out of you,
Mr. Crane.

781
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:32,917
Oh, I'm sorry.

782
00:27:32,917 --> 00:27:34,419
I really wanted to, Daphne.

783
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:35,820
But I just felt kind of awkward.

784
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,555
Oh, it's all right.

785
00:27:37,555 --> 00:27:39,357
Anyway, I should
be toasting you.

786
00:27:39,357 --> 00:27:42,193
I'm going to miss you,
you rotten old sod.

787
00:27:42,193 --> 00:27:43,461
BARTENDER:
Ballentine okay?

788
00:27:43,461 --> 00:27:45,764
Oh, yeah, that's my beer.

789
00:27:45,764 --> 00:27:47,098
Yes.

790
00:27:47,098 --> 00:27:48,566
You know, I just found out

791
00:27:48,566 --> 00:27:49,567
they're going to quit
making this stuff.

792
00:27:49,567 --> 00:27:51,069
Really?
Yeah.

793
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:52,070
There's an end of a era.

794
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:53,505
That's right.

795
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:57,542
It's going to be one sad day
when I get down to my last one.

796
00:27:57,542 --> 00:28:00,345
You know,
it's funny...

797
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:03,682
you get used to having something
in your life.

798
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:05,183
It's part of your day.

799
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:07,052
Just take it for granted.

800
00:28:07,052 --> 00:28:09,421
Then suddenly it's gone,

801
00:28:09,421 --> 00:28:14,459
and you realize
how much it meant to you.

802
00:28:14,459 --> 00:28:17,429
(slow music starts)

803
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:20,398
Hey, guys, great party.

804
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:22,767
Oh, uh, Mel,
why don't you take my seat?

805
00:28:22,767 --> 00:28:24,703
I'm going to sit here
and enjoy the music.

806
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:25,704
I'll join you, Fras.

807
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:27,172
Take my beer over there.

808
00:28:27,172 --> 00:28:28,573
I just want to go
to the restroom.

809
00:28:28,573 --> 00:28:30,442
You know, seeing
that this is my

810
00:28:30,442 --> 00:28:32,444
last night as a
carefree bachelor,

811
00:28:32,944 --> 00:28:34,446
would you care
to dance, Miss?

812
00:28:34,446 --> 00:28:35,947
I'd love to.

813
00:28:35,947 --> 00:28:36,815
Uh-oh.

814
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:46,224
Well, certainly picked
the perfect spot

815
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:47,726
for your wedding.

816
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:48,727
It is, isn't it?

817
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:51,529
We're doing the ceremony
in the garden.

818
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:53,131
Oh. It'll be beautiful.

819
00:28:56,434 --> 00:28:58,903
I love this song.

820
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:00,839
Well, where are my manners?

821
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:02,173
Would you like to dance?

822
00:29:02,173 --> 00:29:03,575
All right.

823
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:07,345
Give us a chance to keep
an eye on those two.

824
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:17,355
Oh... it's been a while

825
00:29:17,355 --> 00:29:20,225
since we've
danced together.

826
00:29:20,225 --> 00:29:22,093
Yes, it has.

827
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:25,797
Thanks for dinner.

828
00:29:26,297 --> 00:29:29,267
It's been a
wonderful evening.

829
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:31,703
It's one of those times

830
00:29:31,703 --> 00:29:34,038
you just don't
want to end.

831
00:29:37,909 --> 00:29:40,745
(song ends, applause)

832
00:29:40,745 --> 00:29:43,948
(new song begins)

833
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:45,817
Excuse me, sir.

834
00:29:45,817 --> 00:29:47,752
You mind if I cut in?

835
00:29:47,752 --> 00:29:48,720
Not at all.

836
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,188
Thank you.

837
00:29:50,188 --> 00:29:51,723
Darling.

838
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:12,277
What in the world
was so urgent

839
00:30:12,277 --> 00:30:14,779
that you brought me
all the way up here?

840
00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:16,281
Niles, just sit down.

841
00:30:16,281 --> 00:30:18,283
Something I need
to discuss with you.

842
00:30:18,283 --> 00:30:19,217
Uh...

843
00:30:21,286 --> 00:30:24,622
I was watching you
on the dance floor just now

844
00:30:24,622 --> 00:30:28,259
and the look in your eyes
was unmistakable.

845
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:29,594
Well, can you blame me?

846
00:30:29,594 --> 00:30:31,095
Mel's quite the little dancer.

847
00:30:31,095 --> 00:30:33,097
Of course, her vertigo
does rule out

848
00:30:33,097 --> 00:30:34,866
any serious twirling, but...

849
00:30:34,866 --> 00:30:38,603
Niles, I'm talking about Daphne.

850
00:30:38,603 --> 00:30:41,306
The way you
were looking at her...

851
00:30:41,306 --> 00:30:44,475
well, it just breaks my heart.

852
00:30:44,475 --> 00:30:45,810
Frasier, it was one thing

853
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:48,313
when you were beating this drum
the other day,

854
00:30:48,313 --> 00:30:49,314
but I'm married now.

855
00:30:49,314 --> 00:30:51,316
What's it going to take
to convince you

856
00:30:51,316 --> 00:30:52,283
that I am over her?

857
00:30:52,283 --> 00:30:54,152
She knows.

858
00:30:54,152 --> 00:30:56,454
What?

859
00:30:56,454 --> 00:30:58,289
Daphne knows that you
have feelings for her.

860
00:30:58,289 --> 00:30:59,757
She's known for some time.

861
00:30:59,757 --> 00:31:01,125
How?

862
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:05,463
Well, it's a long story.

863
00:31:07,165 --> 00:31:08,967
I think Roz said something.

864
00:31:08,967 --> 00:31:11,903
Anyway, she knows.

865
00:31:11,903 --> 00:31:14,806
I knew you thought
my marriage to Mel was hasty

866
00:31:14,806 --> 00:31:16,207
but to poison it like this?

867
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:18,276
I'm not going
to listen to this.

868
00:31:18,276 --> 00:31:20,278
Niles, Daphne feels
the same way about you.

869
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:26,117
At least I think
she does.

870
00:31:26,117 --> 00:31:27,485
She told me as much
the other day

871
00:31:27,485 --> 00:31:29,387
and then she denied it
once you got married.

872
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:31,756
But I saw the way
she was looking at you

873
00:31:31,756 --> 00:31:33,625
downstairs just now.

874
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:35,226
Oh, my God.

875
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:36,494
Niles, I'm not in the habit

876
00:31:36,494 --> 00:31:37,862
of breaking up
people's marriages.

877
00:31:37,862 --> 00:31:40,098
But how could I
not tell you?

878
00:31:40,098 --> 00:31:41,466
You're my brother.

879
00:31:41,466 --> 00:31:42,767
I love you.

880
00:31:42,767 --> 00:31:43,601
(knocking)

881
00:31:44,102 --> 00:31:45,603
MEL:
Niles, darling?

882
00:31:45,603 --> 00:31:46,604
Yes, honey?

883
00:31:46,604 --> 00:31:48,573
You left
with our only room key.

884
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:49,607
Oh, oh. Here.

885
00:31:49,607 --> 00:31:51,609
I'll let you through this way.

886
00:31:51,609 --> 00:31:53,111
I am so sorry.

887
00:31:53,111 --> 00:31:54,479
It's all right.

888
00:31:54,479 --> 00:31:57,382
You have a whole lifetime
to make it up to me.

889
00:31:57,382 --> 00:32:00,385
(chuckling nervously)

890
00:32:00,385 --> 00:32:02,387
(gasping)

891
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:09,661
This is awful.

892
00:32:09,661 --> 00:32:11,195
I love Mel.

893
00:32:11,195 --> 00:32:13,197
It's just...

894
00:32:13,197 --> 00:32:14,699
Oh, I know.
I know.

895
00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:17,135
I have to talk to Daphne.

896
00:32:17,135 --> 00:32:18,536
Come with me.

897
00:32:18,536 --> 00:32:20,071
Maybe while I'm
speaking to her,

898
00:32:20,071 --> 00:32:22,106
you can find some way
to occupy...

899
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:23,107
Donny!
Hello, Daphne.

900
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:24,609
Hey, Doc.
Things were getting

901
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:26,110
a little too wild
for us down there.

902
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:27,612
Oh, just as well.

903
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:28,980
We all have
a very big day tomorrow.

904
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:31,582
About that, Daphne,
can I have a word with you?

905
00:32:31,582 --> 00:32:32,417
All right.
Go ahead.

906
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:33,384
I'm going to get
out of these shoes,

907
00:32:33,384 --> 00:32:34,819
and I'll see you
in a few minutes. Good night.

908
00:32:34,819 --> 00:32:38,222
You know, I'll just
brave the horde,

909
00:32:38,222 --> 00:32:40,224
see if I can get myself
a nightcap.

910
00:32:40,224 --> 00:32:42,694
Uh... good night.

911
00:32:42,694 --> 00:32:44,028
Come in.

912
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:50,034
So, Daphne?

913
00:32:50,034 --> 00:32:51,035
Yes?

914
00:32:52,537 --> 00:32:54,439
May I offer you
something to drink?

915
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:55,707
Um, no, thank you.

916
00:32:55,707 --> 00:32:57,041
Oh, all right.

917
00:32:57,041 --> 00:32:59,844
Anyway, Daphne...

918
00:32:59,844 --> 00:33:00,611
Perhaps an Orangina.

919
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:01,980
Oh, all right.

920
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,848
Maybe I'll join you.

921
00:33:03,848 --> 00:33:06,351
Funny thing
about Orangina--

922
00:33:06,351 --> 00:33:08,619
I never buy
Orangina at home,

923
00:33:08,619 --> 00:33:10,455
but whenever I'm in a hotel
and there's a mini-bar,

924
00:33:10,455 --> 00:33:12,457
it's the first thing I go for.

925
00:33:12,457 --> 00:33:14,459
Orangina.

926
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:28,773
Anyway... I was
just talk...

927
00:33:28,773 --> 00:33:31,242
talking to Frasier
about a conversation

928
00:33:31,242 --> 00:33:32,643
you two had.

929
00:33:32,643 --> 00:33:33,511
Oh, dear.

930
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:34,512
No, no.

931
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:35,513
Don't get upset.

932
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:36,914
I specifically asked him

933
00:33:36,914 --> 00:33:37,982
not to say anything.

934
00:33:37,982 --> 00:33:38,883
What was he thinking?

935
00:33:38,883 --> 00:33:40,218
No, I'm glad he told me.

936
00:33:40,218 --> 00:33:42,186
Oh, yes. So we can have
a big talk about it.

937
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:44,188
That's what
you psychiatrists always do--

938
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:45,456
drag everything
out in the open

939
00:33:45,456 --> 00:33:46,657
so we can work
through it

940
00:33:46,657 --> 00:33:48,526
no matter how awkward
it might be.

941
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:49,927
Well,
I just don't see the point.

942
00:33:49,927 --> 00:33:51,796
Daphne, I'm glad he told me

943
00:33:51,796 --> 00:33:54,232
because I love you.

944
00:33:57,068 --> 00:33:58,469
(laughing):
Excuse me.

945
00:33:58,469 --> 00:33:59,470
Dad?

946
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:00,471
Oh, I'm sorry.

947
00:34:00,471 --> 00:34:01,472
I thought you were in here
with Frasier.

948
00:34:01,472 --> 00:34:02,940
The boys
are playing a game

949
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:05,910
called William Tell
with the seltzer hose, and...

950
00:34:07,945 --> 00:34:09,914
Uh, oh, well, uh... anyway.

951
00:34:09,914 --> 00:34:13,918
Why don't you two just go on
doing whatever you were doing,

952
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:15,420
and I'll just, uh...

953
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:18,890
I'll be down in the lobby
by the fireplace.

954
00:34:20,324 --> 00:34:23,161
Dr. Crane,
you shouldn't say such things.

955
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:24,562
It's the truth.

956
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:26,030
Lord knows,
I have tried to deny it,

957
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:28,332
tried to pretend
that I'm over you,

958
00:34:28,332 --> 00:34:30,034
but not a day
has gone by

959
00:34:30,034 --> 00:34:31,969
when I haven't thought of you--

960
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:34,472
your smile, your beautiful eyes,

961
00:34:34,472 --> 00:34:36,941
what it would be like
to hold your hands

962
00:34:36,941 --> 00:34:39,744
and ask you the question
I never dared ask...

963
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,512
What's the difference
between a blister and a boil?

964
00:34:41,512 --> 00:34:42,814
Donny!

965
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:45,750
I took my shoe off,

966
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:48,219
and it was like I'm growing
another anklebone down here.

967
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:49,687
Doc, you went to med school.

968
00:34:49,687 --> 00:34:50,688
What am I supposed
to do with this?

969
00:34:50,688 --> 00:34:52,190
Lance it or something?

970
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:53,624
You know,
as I recall

971
00:34:53,624 --> 00:34:55,693
the best thing
for that would be

972
00:34:55,693 --> 00:34:57,061
to soak it
in tepid water

973
00:34:57,061 --> 00:34:58,429
for at least half an hour.

974
00:34:58,429 --> 00:34:59,297
All right.
What luck, huh?

975
00:34:59,297 --> 00:35:01,666
Can you imagine a worse thing
could have happened to me

976
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:04,435
the night before my wedding?

977
00:35:08,706 --> 00:35:09,974
I don't understand.

978
00:35:09,974 --> 00:35:12,410
How come you
never said anything before?

979
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:13,845
Daphne, I wanted to.

980
00:35:13,845 --> 00:35:15,313
I just... the timing
never seemed right.

981
00:35:15,313 --> 00:35:17,248
Oh, and the timing's right now?

982
00:35:17,248 --> 00:35:20,518
I'm 12 hours from the altar
and you're on your honeymoon.

983
00:35:20,518 --> 00:35:21,819
I would never have
gotten married

984
00:35:21,819 --> 00:35:23,821
if I thought there was
the slightest chance

985
00:35:23,821 --> 00:35:24,789
that you shared my feelings.

986
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:26,624
Trust me, Daphne,
say the word,

987
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:28,993
and I will leave Mel
in a heartbeat.

988
00:35:28,993 --> 00:35:29,994
MEL:
Niles?

989
00:35:29,994 --> 00:35:30,995
Darling.

990
00:35:30,995 --> 00:35:32,997
I was just looking
over these brochures

991
00:35:32,997 --> 00:35:33,998
for our honeymoon.

992
00:35:33,998 --> 00:35:35,766
Hi, Daphne.
Hi.

993
00:35:35,766 --> 00:35:37,034
The Danieli has
a step-down tub,

994
00:35:37,034 --> 00:35:39,871
but the Gritti has
the most romantic view
of the Grand Canal.

995
00:35:39,871 --> 00:35:40,705
What do you think?

996
00:35:40,705 --> 00:35:42,006
I think a woman

997
00:35:42,006 --> 00:35:43,274
with your exquisite taste

998
00:35:43,274 --> 00:35:44,542
can handle this decision.

999
00:35:44,542 --> 00:35:45,810
He says that now.

1000
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:48,279
Wait till the
honeymoon's over.

1001
00:35:51,015 --> 00:35:54,085
Don't the doors
in this bloody place lock?

1002
00:35:54,085 --> 00:35:55,186
I'll get this one.
You get that one!

1003
00:35:59,557 --> 00:36:02,927
Daphne, it is not
too late for us.

1004
00:36:02,927 --> 00:36:05,163
I meant what I said
when I said I would leave her.

1005
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:06,030
That's crazy.

1006
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:07,431
No, no, it's
not crazy

1007
00:36:07,431 --> 00:36:09,834
if you feel the same way I do.

1008
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:12,336
But I need you to tell me,

1009
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:15,640
and I can accept it
if the answer is no...

1010
00:36:17,241 --> 00:36:19,310
how do you feel about me?

1011
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:20,545
(door opening)

1012
00:36:20,545 --> 00:36:21,512
Pardon.
Simon?

1013
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:23,514
How could you get in here?

1014
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:26,017
Frasier loaned me his key,
in a manner of speaking.

1015
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:28,319
I have to get some things
out of the mini-bar.

1016
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:30,888
I don't want to get caught
empty-handed

1017
00:36:30,888 --> 00:36:32,657
when last call comes.

1018
00:36:34,926 --> 00:36:39,096
You're not having a last call
of your own in here, are you?

1019
00:36:40,264 --> 00:36:41,632
Of course not.

1020
00:36:41,632 --> 00:36:44,068
Right.

1021
00:36:44,068 --> 00:36:46,537
This isn't the chap
whose baby you're having, is it?

1022
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:47,505
Excuse me?

1023
00:36:47,505 --> 00:36:49,407
I'm not pregnant!

1024
00:36:49,407 --> 00:36:50,741
Simon!

1025
00:36:50,741 --> 00:36:52,076
Bit of bad news.

1026
00:36:52,076 --> 00:36:52,910
Nigel!

1027
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:54,378
Peter's got sick
into the piano

1028
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:56,247
so we've been asked
to vacate the bar.

1029
00:36:56,247 --> 00:36:57,615
Bloody hell, Daphne.

1030
00:36:57,615 --> 00:36:59,450
Nice hotel you picked.

1031
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:00,284
Well, Nigel, I'm sure

1032
00:37:00,284 --> 00:37:02,286
Daphne won't mind
we help ourselves

1033
00:37:02,286 --> 00:37:04,155
to the contents of her mini-bar.
Away you go.

1034
00:37:04,155 --> 00:37:05,456
Right. Give us
a hand, lads!

1035
00:37:05,456 --> 00:37:06,324
Nigel!

1036
00:37:06,324 --> 00:37:08,292
Stephen! Peter! David!
Michael! Billy!

1037
00:37:08,793 --> 00:37:10,161
What are you all doing
in here?

1038
00:37:10,161 --> 00:37:11,562
So here you all are.

1039
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:14,065
What is the point
of bringing the party

1040
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,399
down to the Winnebago

1041
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:17,568
when there's a perfectly
nice room right here?

1042
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:19,337
You're not moving
the party in here.

1043
00:37:19,337 --> 00:37:20,238
Oh, Daphne,
don't get

1044
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:21,672
your blood pressure up.

1045
00:37:21,672 --> 00:37:23,107
You've got your baby
to think of.

1046
00:37:23,107 --> 00:37:24,442
Here, have a drink

1047
00:37:24,442 --> 00:37:27,678
and relax... oh, God.

1048
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:34,952
I'm sorry
about all that.

1049
00:37:34,952 --> 00:37:36,887
I must be in love.

1050
00:37:36,887 --> 00:37:40,424
It doesn't even bother me
that you come with them.

1051
00:37:43,394 --> 00:37:44,895
Lovely night, isn't it?

1052
00:37:44,895 --> 00:37:45,896
Hmm.

1053
00:37:45,896 --> 00:37:47,398
Stars are out.

1054
00:37:47,398 --> 00:37:49,400
There's a nice breeze.

1055
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,735
(inhaling)

1056
00:37:50,735 --> 00:37:54,071
Hmm?
Night-blooming jasmine.

1057
00:37:54,071 --> 00:37:57,074
And of course,
there's the beautiful girl.

1058
00:37:57,074 --> 00:38:00,077
Dr. Crane, I still haven't
answered your question.

1059
00:38:00,077 --> 00:38:01,078
Yes, I know.

1060
00:38:01,078 --> 00:38:03,547
That's why I keep talking.

1061
00:38:03,547 --> 00:38:05,483
In case I don't get
the answer I want,

1062
00:38:05,483 --> 00:38:06,984
I can at least make
this moment

1063
00:38:06,984 --> 00:38:09,287
last a little longer.

1064
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:16,093
I'm not sure if it's jasmine
or orange blossoms.

1065
00:38:16,093 --> 00:38:17,595
You know, a lot of times...

1066
00:38:17,595 --> 00:38:19,430
Oh, for God's
sake, Dr. Crane.

1067
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:36,647
I think you
can call me Niles now.

1068
00:38:47,058 --> 00:38:48,559
No.

1069
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:51,562
I don't think I can.

1070
00:38:51,562 --> 00:38:55,933
I do love you, but
I can't do this.

1071
00:38:55,933 --> 00:38:58,302
W-w-well, I know it'll
be difficult, b-but...

1072
00:38:58,302 --> 00:38:59,804
I will get a divorce,

1073
00:38:59,804 --> 00:39:01,305
and you can call off
the wedding.

1074
00:39:01,305 --> 00:39:02,807
I can't.

1075
00:39:02,807 --> 00:39:05,309
Donny is a dear
and wonderful man,

1076
00:39:05,309 --> 00:39:07,745
and I made a
promise to him.

1077
00:39:07,745 --> 00:39:11,482
And, Mel-- you made more
than a promise to her.

1078
00:39:11,482 --> 00:39:13,784
We were supposed to forget that?

1079
00:39:13,784 --> 00:39:17,321
For what? We have no idea
how we'd be together.

1080
00:39:17,321 --> 00:39:20,758
For heaven's sakes,
we've never even been on a date.

1081
00:39:22,226 --> 00:39:24,729
Daphne, take it
from someone who knows.

1082
00:39:24,729 --> 00:39:26,230
You don't want to spend
half your life

1083
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:29,533
thinking about a chance
you didn't take.

1084
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:31,802
I'm sorry.

1085
00:39:31,802 --> 00:39:33,804
My mind's made up.

1086
00:39:36,307 --> 00:39:40,311
I think we should
say good night now.

1087
00:39:47,485 --> 00:39:49,420
Good night, Daphne.

1088
00:39:51,322 --> 00:39:53,657
Good night, Dr. Crane.

1089
00:40:10,274 --> 00:40:11,742
Hey, Niles.

1090
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:14,745
Don't tell me the
ceremony's over already.

1091
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:16,747
Oh, no, it hasn't
even started yet.

1092
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:18,249
Actually, we saw you
heading over this way.

1093
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:20,251
We thought maybe you
could use some company.

1094
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:21,252
I just felt like
some privacy.

1095
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:22,620
This is one wedding

1096
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:25,322
I couldn't see myself
handling very well.

1097
00:40:25,322 --> 00:40:27,425
Oh, lots of people
cry at weddings.

1098
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:28,692
Yeah, but not so many end up

1099
00:40:28,692 --> 00:40:30,594
wailing
and rending their garments.

1100
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:31,962
I appreciate
your coming over,

1101
00:40:31,962 --> 00:40:34,932
but I'd hate for you
to miss it on my account.

1102
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:36,400
Actually,
it's been delayed a bit.

1103
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,902
You see, the justice
of the peace started out

1104
00:40:37,902 --> 00:40:39,737
asking the witnesses
to step forward,

1105
00:40:39,737 --> 00:40:42,440
and three of Daphne's brothers
just ran off into the woods.

1106
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,808
(knocking)

1107
00:40:43,808 --> 00:40:45,309
Ah.

1108
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:48,679
Hello.
Here's your wine, sir.

1109
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:50,681
Yes. Thank you very
much, young man.

1110
00:40:50,681 --> 00:40:52,950
Uh, and, uh,
this is for you.

1111
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:53,818
What is this?

1112
00:40:53,818 --> 00:40:55,719
Well, Niles,
I got to thinking

1113
00:40:55,719 --> 00:40:58,155
about our old friend Morrie

1114
00:40:58,155 --> 00:41:01,659
and how he kept this bottle
of wine his entire life

1115
00:41:01,659 --> 00:41:04,161
waiting for a special occasion.

1116
00:41:04,161 --> 00:41:05,663
And then, I thought

1117
00:41:05,663 --> 00:41:07,531
what occasion
am I saving it for?

1118
00:41:07,531 --> 00:41:09,867
And then I thought
about what a courageous thing

1119
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:10,868
you did last night--

1120
00:41:10,868 --> 00:41:14,205
taking that chance.

1121
00:41:14,205 --> 00:41:16,373
And that's worth a toast.

1122
00:41:16,373 --> 00:41:17,241
No, no, Frasier...

1123
00:41:17,241 --> 00:41:18,509
Niles,
it's too late.

1124
00:41:18,509 --> 00:41:19,777
The foil is pierced.

1125
00:41:19,777 --> 00:41:21,779
I know this thing
between you and Mel

1126
00:41:21,779 --> 00:41:24,281
seems kind of bad
right now, but...

1127
00:41:24,281 --> 00:41:26,150
Oh, now, Dad, why
do you say that?

1128
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:28,018
Just because I spent
the third night of my marriage

1129
00:41:28,018 --> 00:41:30,521
proposing to another woman?

1130
00:41:30,521 --> 00:41:31,989
Well, I'm just saying

1131
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:33,491
that marriages survive
all kinds of stuff.

1132
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:35,493
You know, you
might still be happy.

1133
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:38,295
Ten years from now, this
could all be ancient history.

1134
00:41:38,295 --> 00:41:40,397
I hope you're right.

1135
00:41:40,397 --> 00:41:42,132
FRASIER:
All right, gentlemen.

1136
00:41:42,132 --> 00:41:44,535
Here we are.

1137
00:41:44,535 --> 00:41:48,038
Dad, Niles-- allow me.

1138
00:41:48,539 --> 00:41:50,808
To better days.

1139
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:07,758
Dad, where did Morrie keep this?

1140
00:42:07,758 --> 00:42:08,993
In his wine rack.

1141
00:42:08,993 --> 00:42:10,027
Which is?

1142
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:11,529
In the boiler room.
Oh, Lord.

1143
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:14,532
I'll just save this little treat
for later.

1144
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:17,001
Yes, well, thanks
for the thought.

1145
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:19,436
You two should be running along.
I'll be fine.

1146
00:42:19,436 --> 00:42:21,205
All right, well,
take care, Niles.

1147
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:22,373
FRASIER:
I saw a waiter

1148
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:23,741
passing champagne just outside.

1149
00:42:24,241 --> 00:42:26,243
I'll have him bring you
a glass, so you can...

1150
00:42:26,243 --> 00:42:29,547
Get the taste out.
Yes, thank you, Frasier.

1151
00:42:42,092 --> 00:42:44,094
(knocking)

1152
00:42:44,094 --> 00:42:44,995
Come in.

1153
00:42:44,995 --> 00:42:47,831
Hello.

1154
00:42:47,831 --> 00:42:50,701
Daphne.

1155
00:42:50,701 --> 00:42:52,069
I was wondering...

1156
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:54,905
if you might be free for a date.

1157
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:58,075
Oh, my God, yes.

1158
00:42:59,043 --> 00:43:01,078
There's plenty of time
for that later.

1159
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:02,947
Let's get
this bloody boat moving.

1160
00:43:02,947 --> 00:43:05,449
What... you mean now?

1161
00:43:05,449 --> 00:43:07,451
There's about
a hundred people back there

1162
00:43:07,451 --> 00:43:08,953
I'm not so keen on seeing.

1163
00:43:08,953 --> 00:43:10,454
All right.

1164
00:43:10,454 --> 00:43:12,790
Let's go then.

1165
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:15,693
Fasten your seat belt, Daphne.

1166
00:43:15,693 --> 00:43:18,028
Fasten yours, Niles.
