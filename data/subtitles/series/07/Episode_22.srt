1
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:09,542
Hey, morning, Fras.

2
00:00:10,076 --> 00:00:10,577
Hi, Roz.

3
00:00:11,077 --> 00:00:13,079
Well... well, is...
is Baby Alice dressed

4
00:00:13,079 --> 00:00:14,547
as a little turkey,

5
00:00:14,547 --> 00:00:16,082
or am I just
very, very hungry?

6
00:00:16,082 --> 00:00:17,584
(both laugh)

7
00:00:17,584 --> 00:00:18,585
We're flying home
for Thanksgiving

8
00:00:18,585 --> 00:00:19,853
right after the show.

9
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:21,021
I thought
I'd make Alice

10
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:21,888
look as cute as possible,

11
00:00:22,389 --> 00:00:23,390
so if she cries on the plane,

12
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:24,891
the other passengers
can't get mad.
Ah.

13
00:00:24,891 --> 00:00:26,393
Actually, what I'd like to do

14
00:00:26,393 --> 00:00:28,228
is keep her awake,
so she'll sleep on the plane.

15
00:00:28,228 --> 00:00:29,596
You know, you should just do
what I used to do.

16
00:00:29,596 --> 00:00:31,097
I used to tell the passengers
that if Frederick cried,

17
00:00:31,097 --> 00:00:32,565
I'd buy them all a drink.

18
00:00:32,565 --> 00:00:34,434
And that worked?
Oh, yes.

19
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:36,336
In fact, one time,
I woke from a short nap,

20
00:00:36,336 --> 00:00:38,772
and the fellow sitting behind us
was flicking the back

21
00:00:38,772 --> 00:00:40,173
of Frederick's
little ear.

22
00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:41,641
Of course, that
was cheating,

23
00:00:41,641 --> 00:00:43,143
and the man did
not get his drink.

24
00:00:43,143 --> 00:00:45,145
So when is Frederick
coming, anyway?

25
00:00:45,145 --> 00:00:47,047
Oh, well, Lilith's dropping
him off around noon,

26
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:49,816
then she's off to visit
a colleague for Thanksgiving

27
00:00:49,816 --> 00:00:51,251
in Vancouver.

28
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:52,252
You know, come to think of it,

29
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:54,254
do they even celebrate
Thanksgiving in Canada?

30
00:00:54,254 --> 00:00:56,756
They will when she leaves.

31
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:04,597
(doorbell rings)

32
00:01:04,597 --> 00:01:06,099
(footsteps)

33
00:01:06,099 --> 00:01:07,033
Hi, Dad.

34
00:01:07,033 --> 00:01:08,101
Frederick!

35
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:09,102
(laughing):
Hi.

36
00:01:09,102 --> 00:01:10,103
Hello, Frasier.

37
00:01:10,103 --> 00:01:11,004
Hello. Oh, gosh, you know,

38
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:12,505
I was starting to get
worried about you.

39
00:01:12,505 --> 00:01:13,506
You're an hour late.

40
00:01:13,506 --> 00:01:15,508
We saw a big accident
on the freeway.

41
00:01:15,508 --> 00:01:16,943
Mom saved this guy's life.

42
00:01:16,943 --> 00:01:18,711
Really?
Well, that's
going a bit far.

43
00:01:18,711 --> 00:01:20,180
I simply applied
a tourniquet.

44
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,448
She's a hero.

45
00:01:21,448 --> 00:01:23,616
Yes, that's your mother,
all right, son.

46
00:01:23,616 --> 00:01:25,018
Then the paramedics came

47
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:27,420
and wanted to give
Mom a transfusion.

48
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,856
Yes, that's your mother,
all right, son.

49
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:32,325
If you don't mind,
I'd like to use the phone

50
00:01:32,325 --> 00:01:34,260
and call my colleague
and tell him I'll be late.

51
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,662
Yes, of course.

52
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:37,497
Who is this colleague anyway?

53
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:39,499
He's the man
who supplies me
with lab rats.

54
00:01:39,499 --> 00:01:42,001
It's about time
we got together socially.

55
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:44,938
I've known him
for over 52 generations.

56
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:47,373
Ah. Well, if the drumsticks
are about this big,

57
00:01:47,373 --> 00:01:48,808
you'll know why.

58
00:01:48,808 --> 00:01:49,676
Good one, Dad.

59
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:51,044
Thank you, son.

60
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:52,612
Hello, Peter,
it's Lilith.

61
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:55,381
Listen, I'm
running about an
hour late, so I...

62
00:01:55,381 --> 00:01:57,550
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry

63
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:58,885
to hear that.

64
00:01:58,885 --> 00:02:00,854
Well, take care of yourself.

65
00:02:00,854 --> 00:02:02,155
Okay. Good-bye.

66
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:03,756
What's happened?

67
00:02:03,756 --> 00:02:05,625
Peter's come down
with something.

68
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,961
Thinks he caught it
from the rats.

69
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,162
Oh, now, nobody ever got
anything from a rat

70
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:10,730
that wasn't resolved
in a day or two.

71
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:12,065
Off you go.

72
00:02:12,932 --> 00:02:14,400
Hey, Mom,

73
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,402
why don't you spend
Thanksgiving with us?

74
00:02:16,402 --> 00:02:18,371
(laughs)
That's a very
good one, Frederick.

75
00:02:18,371 --> 00:02:21,307
Now go kiss your mother
good-bye and unpack, all right?

76
00:02:24,777 --> 00:02:26,279
Would it be that unbearable

77
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:27,780
for me to be here
for one meal?

78
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,283
As soon as we're done,
I'll go check into a hotel.

79
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:31,784
I can spend the weekend

80
00:02:31,784 --> 00:02:33,286
working on an article
I've been writing.

81
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:35,555
Well, you know Niles
is coming this afternoon,

82
00:02:35,555 --> 00:02:37,323
and it'd be very uncomfortable,
I think.

83
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:38,825
You know, you two
haven't seen each other

84
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:40,693
since your little tryst.

85
00:02:40,693 --> 00:02:42,462
Oh, please.
Niles and I are adults.

86
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:44,430
I suppose you're right.

87
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,699
It would mean
a lot to Frederick.

88
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:47,867
After all,

89
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:51,104
Thanksgiving
is a time to celebrate family.

90
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:52,272
(doorknob jiggling)

91
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:53,139
Come in.

92
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:55,141
Is the witch
gone yet?

93
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:01,781
Lilith's still here, Dad.

94
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:04,050
Oh. In that case,

95
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:06,219
I'll ask you, too.

96
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:08,121
Lilith, has my twitch
gone yet?

97
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:10,123
I had some
very strong coffee

98
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:11,024
this morning, and...

99
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,992
Skillfully done, Martin.

100
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:14,727
(footsteps running)

101
00:03:14,727 --> 00:03:15,762
Grandpa!

102
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:17,497
Oh, Freddy!

103
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:18,464
How you doing?

104
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:20,967
So, Dad, is Mom

105
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:22,268
staying for dinner?

106
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:23,970
Yes, Frederick, I am.

107
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:26,306
Isn't that
great, Grandpa?

108
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:27,307
Great, Freddy.

109
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:29,309
Real great.

110
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:32,612
Isn't that great,
Freddy?

111
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:34,280
Are you okay, Grandpa?

112
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,749
He's worried about his twitch.

113
00:03:36,749 --> 00:03:38,117
(doorbell rings)

114
00:03:38,117 --> 00:03:40,820
(Eddie whimpering)
Come on, Eddie, come on.

115
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,155
What's the matter?

116
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:43,156
He was perfectly fine

117
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:44,490
until about
a block from here.

118
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,859
Then he started
whining and trembling.

119
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:51,497
It's like he senses
an earthquake or a dark force

120
00:03:51,497 --> 00:03:54,500
or-- hello, Lilith--
a vortex of evil.

121
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:56,803
MARTIN:
Here, here,
let me have him.

122
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:58,338
Come on, I'll take him.

123
00:03:58,338 --> 00:03:59,305
Yeah, it's okay.

124
00:03:59,305 --> 00:04:00,240
Come on, boy.

125
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,574
That's all right.

126
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:02,475
Don't worry.

127
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:04,377
Nothing to be scared of.

128
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:05,878
I'll help with
the groceries.

129
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:07,380
Hey, Freddy.

130
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,348
Thank you.

131
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:11,084
Well, I'd better see
how the turkey's coming.

132
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,852
Yes, Daphne's preparing dinner.

133
00:04:12,852 --> 00:04:14,754
Oh, should we tell her
there's an extra person?

134
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:18,157
(clattering)

135
00:04:18,157 --> 00:04:20,393
No need.

136
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:21,661
(doorbell rings)

137
00:04:24,163 --> 00:04:25,164
Hello, Frasier.

138
00:04:25,164 --> 00:04:26,165
Niles.

139
00:04:26,165 --> 00:04:27,667
Hello, Lilith.

140
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:28,935
Hello, Niles.

141
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:29,702
Lovely to see you again.

142
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:31,204
Nice to see
you, too.

143
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:33,206
I trust your flight
was uneventful.

144
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:35,241
Up, down, bumpy
over the mountains.

145
00:04:35,241 --> 00:04:36,743
Isn't that always the way?

146
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:39,245
Lilith is joining us
for dinner, Niles.

147
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:40,513
What a nice surprise.

148
00:04:40,513 --> 00:04:41,681
It certainly
is nice for me.

149
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:43,049
Well, not as nice
as it is for me.

150
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:45,518
Oh, stop it, both of you.

151
00:04:47,353 --> 00:04:48,721
I refuse to spend the day

152
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:50,123
listening
to this stilted chatter.

153
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,557
Well, how would you
have us behave?

154
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:52,558
Well, why don't you try

155
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:53,559
going back
to your former relationship.

156
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:55,061
All we did was
insult each other.

157
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:56,462
Yes.

158
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:57,864
You're willing to throw that
away because of one

159
00:04:57,864 --> 00:04:59,198
ill-considered
night of passion?

160
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:02,035
It happened.

161
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:04,504
Take from it what you
can learn. Move on.

162
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:07,473
Well... I learned

163
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:11,944
if you kiss her too fast,
you get an ice cream headache.

164
00:05:20,186 --> 00:05:23,990
You also learned that I have
twice your upper-body strength,

165
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,825
so shut your pie hole.

166
00:05:27,026 --> 00:05:28,961
Was that so hard?

167
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:32,098
Wait, wait, wait.

168
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:33,166
What are you doing?

169
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,934
I'm mashing
the potatoes.

170
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:36,736
By hand? You're supposed
to whip potatoes.

171
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:39,105
That way, every bite
tastes the same.

172
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:40,773
Well, isn't that a bit bland?

173
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:41,574
Hello.

174
00:05:41,574 --> 00:05:43,576
Welcome to potatoes.

175
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:49,849
Could you just once cook
a traditional Thanksgiving meal?

176
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:52,218
I mean, look
at this cranberry sauce.

177
00:05:52,218 --> 00:05:54,687
It's supposed to keep
the shape of the can--

178
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:56,222
quiver a little bit.

179
00:05:56,222 --> 00:05:58,624
What are all these
little chunks in there?

180
00:05:58,624 --> 00:06:00,426
Those are cranberries.

181
00:06:00,426 --> 00:06:01,794
Dad, here you are.

182
00:06:01,794 --> 00:06:03,629
One frozen pumpkin pie
as requested.
Ah.

183
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:04,964
Honestly, wouldn't you rather

184
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:06,833
I just bake
a pie from scratch?

185
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,234
Is it that
you can'tl earn

186
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:11,137
or you won't learn?

187
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:13,539
I'm done setting the table.

188
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:14,540
Oh, you set the table.

189
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,542
That's very nice,
very elegant, Frederick.

190
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:18,444
Oh, yes, Freddy's
been quite the
little helper.

191
00:06:18,444 --> 00:06:21,247
Every time I bend over to
check the turkey, there he is.

192
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:28,020
So, Lilith, tell me about
this article you're writing.

193
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,422
FREDERICK:
It's about me.

194
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:30,790
Essentially, yes.

195
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,291
I was talking to a friend

196
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:34,327
who works at the New
York Times Magazine

197
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:36,329
about raising a
child after divorce.

198
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:38,331
And she pointed out that,
as a psychiatrist,

199
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:40,133
I might have a
unique perspective.

200
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:43,369
You know,
since it's about me,

201
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:45,171
shouldn't I get
something for it?

202
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:47,273
You're not getting a minibike.

203
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:48,040
But, Mom...

204
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,542
We have talked about this.

205
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:50,943
You can get one
when you're 15.

206
00:06:50,943 --> 00:06:52,712
But all my friends
have minibikes.

207
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:55,081
Yes, and if all of your friends
decided to enter

208
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,582
a level-four biohazard area

209
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:59,085
without their
environmental containment suits,

210
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,386
would you do that, too?

211
00:07:00,386 --> 00:07:01,921
This is different.

212
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,189
No, it's not.

213
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:04,457
Dad?

214
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:05,191
Sorry, Frederick.

215
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:07,026
I'm with your mother
on this one.

216
00:07:07,026 --> 00:07:08,127
Dinner's almost ready.

217
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:08,995
Excuse me.

218
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:13,900
You know what
I think, Dad?

219
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,736
You and Mom should write
this article together.

220
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:19,539
Well, I'm sure your mother
can write it without my help.

221
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:20,973
But it was her idea.

222
00:07:20,973 --> 00:07:22,642
Hmm?
She told me
on the plane

223
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:24,444
how much easier
it would be.

224
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,746
I just don't think she
knows how to ask you.

225
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:28,080
It is an intriguing idea.

226
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,550
MARTIN:
Frasier, I could use
some help out here.

227
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:33,853
He's picking the raisins
out of the stuffing.

228
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:34,687
Oh, Lord.

229
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:37,190
All right,
coming, Dad.

230
00:07:40,526 --> 00:07:42,028
You know, I think
you and Dad

231
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:43,529
should write this
article together.

232
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:45,064
Together?

233
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:47,533
Well, I think the last thing
your father wants

234
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:49,068
is to collaborate
with me.

235
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:51,037
It was his idea.

236
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:53,539
He just told me how
much fun it would be.

237
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:55,575
Well, it's
an interesting notion.

238
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:56,876
Beautiful job

239
00:07:56,876 --> 00:07:58,744
carving that turkey,
Dr. Crane.

240
00:07:58,744 --> 00:08:00,646
Well, I picked up a thing
or two in medical school.

241
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:03,516
In case you're wondering,
this bird appears

242
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:06,018
to have died
of a massive head trauma.

243
00:08:08,287 --> 00:08:09,655
Did you wash
your hands, Frederick?

244
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:11,657
Yeah. Uncle Niles
even showed me how

245
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:12,658
to open the door
with my elbow

246
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:15,528
so I don't need to
touch the handle.

247
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:17,897
What are uncles for?

248
00:08:17,897 --> 00:08:19,765
Daphne, is your
fianceï¿© joining us?

249
00:08:19,765 --> 00:08:21,267
No. I'll be seeing him later.

250
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:23,636
Donny has his own
Thanksgiving tradition.

251
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:25,471
He has a dinner for
all the divorced men

252
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:26,973
he's represented
during the year.

253
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:28,808
He's hosting 25 today.

254
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:31,577
Wow. 25 lonely, bitter men.

255
00:08:31,577 --> 00:08:33,479
It's been a good year.

256
00:08:35,314 --> 00:08:37,250
Uncle Niles,
Mom's writing

257
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,651
an article about me.

258
00:08:38,651 --> 00:08:40,219
Really?

259
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:42,221
It's about raising
a child after divorce.

260
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:44,590
Yes, it sounds fascinating,
doesn't it?

261
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:47,260
It's a subject that's very
near and dear to my own heart.

262
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,195
Are you suggesting
we collaborate?

263
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,631
Well, if you think
I might be helpful.

264
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:52,532
What a great idea.

265
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,000
You can write it together.

266
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,967
I'd be willing.

267
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:56,469
Well, we
certainly did well

268
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:58,304
on our first
collaboration.

269
00:08:58,304 --> 00:08:59,505
You know, Lilith,
we could probably get most

270
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:00,439
of it done
in the time

271
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:01,807
you're still
here in town.

272
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:02,675
And if she stayed here,

273
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:04,510
you can finish
the whole thing.

274
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:06,812
Well, guess it'll be
all right by me.

275
00:09:06,812 --> 00:09:08,314
Daphne, would that

276
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:09,782
be too much of
an imposition?

277
00:09:09,782 --> 00:09:10,783
Not at all.

278
00:09:10,783 --> 00:09:12,785
I'll be spending the
weekend with Donny.

279
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:14,754
Now, where is your father
with that gravy?

280
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:16,255
Well, then
I'll stay here.

281
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:17,256
Although, maybe we

282
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:19,258
should run this
by your father.

283
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:20,192
Hmm.

284
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:21,594
(crashing)

285
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,464
No need.

286
00:09:32,838 --> 00:09:34,840
(paper tearing)

287
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:38,344
Yes. I think we should
have something

288
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:41,180
about non custodial
parents and discipline.

289
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,548
Exactly.

290
00:09:42,548 --> 00:09:43,549
The weekend father

291
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:46,052
need not be
a weakened father.

292
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:47,553
(chuckles)

293
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:49,555
Frasier, you still
have a direct line

294
00:09:49,555 --> 00:09:51,057
to my funny bone.

295
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:52,058
(laughs)

296
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:54,560
Thank goodness,
the line wasn't busy.

297
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,562
Now, stop. If we
laugh all night,

298
00:09:56,562 --> 00:09:58,898
we'll never get
any work done.

299
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:00,232
(video game playing)

300
00:10:00,232 --> 00:10:01,767
(knock at door)

301
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:04,270
Hey, Frederick,
I'm leaving.

302
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,271
I just...

303
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:06,272
What you doing?

304
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,773
I'm saving the universe.

305
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,241
You want to help?

306
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:11,277
I wouldn't know
where to begin.

307
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:12,745
It's easy.
I'll show you.

308
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:15,047
Oh, all right.
What do I do?

309
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:15,848
That's your guy.

310
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:17,350
You've just escaped

311
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:20,152
from an intergalactic
maximum security prison pod.

312
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:21,921
Like they could hold me.

313
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:23,923
Now, once you leave
this chamber,

314
00:10:23,923 --> 00:10:24,924
you can go left or right,

315
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:27,426
and different things
will happen to you.

316
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:28,427
Okay.

317
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:29,929
(character screams)

318
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:32,431
What happened?

319
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:38,237
Wow. I never saw the guy
trip and fall before.

320
00:10:38,237 --> 00:10:39,038
Try it again.

321
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:40,873
You have two lives left.
Oh.

322
00:10:40,873 --> 00:10:42,675
(character screams)

323
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:45,144
I... can't seem to
get out of this room.

324
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,179
Is this some sort
of advanced level?

325
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:48,481
No.

326
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,616
This is, like,
the training area.

327
00:10:50,616 --> 00:10:53,986
I didn't even know
you could die here.

328
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:58,224
(character screams)

329
00:10:58,224 --> 00:11:00,726
I have to get out
of this room.

330
00:11:00,726 --> 00:11:02,728
The reset button
is on the right.

331
00:11:02,728 --> 00:11:04,230
You want
something to drink?

332
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,631
Quiet.

333
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:07,533
Hi, Dad.

334
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:08,501
Oh. Hi, son.

335
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:09,935
How's the writing?

336
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:12,171
Well, it's coming
along nicely, thanks.

337
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:13,506
Oh. Mom wants to know

338
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,474
if you'd bring out
a little wine.

339
00:11:15,474 --> 00:11:17,009
Oh, all right.

340
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:20,513
You know, it's great to see
you and Mom working together.

341
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,515
I think she
kind of misses you.

342
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:23,516
Really?

343
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,017
Yeah. She talks about you

344
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,519
all the time, you know--

345
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:27,820
how wonderful you are,

346
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,489
and how she's never met
another man like you.

347
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:32,792
You go take that out to her.

348
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:34,293
I'll finish up in here.

349
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:36,295
Thank you, son.

350
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:41,333
There you are.

351
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:42,835
Oh. Oh, thank you.

352
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:44,336
Mm-hmm.

353
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:46,338
Um, I've been
rearranging
this outline.

354
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:48,340
Why don't you
take a look?

355
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,775
Uh, looks fine.

356
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:52,978
Frasier, you can't see it
from there. Sit down.

357
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:58,384
You know, I'm really
enjoying this collaboration.

358
00:11:58,384 --> 00:11:59,885
Me, too.

359
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:02,388
Is it me, or is it
getting warm?

360
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:05,191
It is a little warm.

361
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:08,294
All right, boy,
I'm coming.

362
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:09,128
I'm coming.

363
00:12:09,628 --> 00:12:10,496
FRASIER:
You know, Dad,

364
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:12,031
let me walk you out.

365
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:13,032
Okay.

366
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:14,834
Something I want
to discuss with you.

367
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:16,368
(growls)
You know,

368
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:18,070
I've never seen him
so eager to take a walk.

369
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,939
I wonder what...

370
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:21,340
Oh, right.

371
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:26,846
Hey, Mom, how's
the article going?

372
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:28,748
Very well, thank you.

373
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:31,150
You know, I've never
seen Dad this happy.

374
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:33,619
Oh? What do you mean?

375
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:36,021
Well, all he does
is talk about you--

376
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:37,523
how pretty you look,

377
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:39,892
and how smart
you are...

378
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:43,129
and how much he misses you.

379
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:47,133
What makes you think
she's coming on to you?

380
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:49,935
Well, actually,
Frederick told me.

381
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:51,237
But, you know,
it actually makes sense.

382
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:53,739
I mean, this colleague of hers
gets mysteriously ill;

383
00:12:53,739 --> 00:12:55,741
she lassos me into writing
this article with her,

384
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:57,209
then all of a sudden,
before I know it,

385
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:59,578
the bun is off, she's waggling
a bare shoulder at me.

386
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:02,448
Oh, please. Some of us
just had a big meal.

387
00:13:03,849 --> 00:13:04,750
(knock at door)

388
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,252
It's not your turn yet.

389
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:07,753
I still have two more lives.

390
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:09,221
It's Lilith.

391
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:10,756
(character screams)

392
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:15,060
I need to talk to you.

393
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,729
Does the door have to be closed?

394
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:18,097
I think it's best.

395
00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:19,598
It's of a personal nature.

396
00:13:19,598 --> 00:13:21,100
What's this about?

397
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,102
Well, it's about
an attraction

398
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:25,137
that I thought was over,

399
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:28,073
and now I'm beginning
to think maybe it's not.

400
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:29,475
Usually, in my dreams

401
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:33,312
this is where
I try to run and can't.

402
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:36,148
This isn't about you,
you egomaniac.

403
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:37,650
This is about Frasier.

404
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,452
I think he wants
us together again.

405
00:13:40,452 --> 00:13:42,288
He knows how I feel
about you.

406
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:43,289
Not us!

407
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:44,790
Me and Frasier!

408
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:47,793
Is there a chair here
I could talk to?

409
00:13:47,793 --> 00:13:49,795
(character screams)

410
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,531
Well, what makes you think

411
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:54,934
he wants you
to get back together?

412
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:56,335
Well, first, he offers

413
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,337
to collaborate
on this article.

414
00:13:58,337 --> 00:13:59,839
Now he's plying
me with wine.

415
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:01,340
At this very moment,

416
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,842
I suspect he's
asking your father

417
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,243
to clear out
for the night.

418
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:07,179
Well, so he took a professional
interest in your article,

419
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,682
and he offered you some wine
on Thanksgiving.

420
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:10,983
Now who's the egomaniac?

421
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:14,787
Perhaps I am
overreacting.

422
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:17,289
I'll just have to
keep my eyes peeled

423
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:19,291
for more
conclusive evidence.

424
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:22,728
I didn't know
there was a door there.

425
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:24,196
Then again,
maybe I've just made

426
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:25,698
this whole thing up
in my head.

427
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,032
Tell you what, Dad.

428
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:29,401
Take a minute,
and then come back in.

429
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:31,370
See what you think
is going on in there,

430
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:34,206
and then find some subtle way
to tell me what you think.

431
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:35,541
All right, okay, uh,

432
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:36,442
just give me a minute.

433
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:43,482
(Ravel's "Bolero" playing)

434
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:05,704
Frasier.

435
00:15:05,704 --> 00:15:07,539
Lilith.

436
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:10,309
Well, isn't this... nice?

437
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:13,412
Yes. Very nice.

438
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:15,681
Oh, uh, excuse me again.

439
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:18,517
I just came back
to get an umbrella
in case it rains.

440
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:20,886
But I hope it doesn't,
'cause Eddie's just dying

441
00:15:20,886 --> 00:15:22,388
to play this new game
I taught him.

442
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:24,890
I take off his leash,
and I say, "Run for your life!"

443
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:26,392
(laughs)

444
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:29,795
That's exactly what I say:
"Run for your life!"

445
00:15:29,795 --> 00:15:31,563
Thank you, Dad.

446
00:15:31,563 --> 00:15:32,865
Okay.

447
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:34,300
Run for your life!

448
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:37,169
Frasier, we have to talk.

449
00:15:37,169 --> 00:15:38,637
Yes, Lilith, we do.

450
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:40,539
I mean, I can't just
sit here all night,

451
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:43,008
waiting for you
to make your move.

452
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:46,345
Well, you've just got this
all worked out, haven't you?

453
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:47,680
Well, let's see.

454
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,181
Candlelight, wine,
soft music--

455
00:15:49,181 --> 00:15:50,683
What else do I need?

456
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:51,684
I don't know
what's worse--

457
00:15:52,184 --> 00:15:54,186
that you want me back,
or that you think

458
00:15:54,186 --> 00:15:55,454
I could be
won so easily.

459
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,823
Wait. You think
I'm responsible for this?

460
00:15:57,823 --> 00:15:59,291
You assume you can
just snap your fingers,

461
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,793
and old Frasier
will come a-running?

462
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,795
Well, I'm sorry. It doesn't
work that way, sister.

463
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:05,698
First of all,
I have to be finessed!

464
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:09,101
I didn't do any of this.

465
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:13,405
And if you didn't either,
then someone is setting us up.

466
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:15,708
But who...

467
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,643
Frederick.

468
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:21,914
He told me that you've
been pining for me.

469
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:24,583
He just told me
the same about you.

470
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:26,452
Good Lord.

471
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:28,454
Here we are
writing an article

472
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:30,856
on taking your child
through a divorce, and...

473
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:33,225
our own son is nursing
a hopeless fantasy

474
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:35,127
that we'll get back together.

475
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:36,895
We've got to go
talk with him.

476
00:16:36,895 --> 00:16:37,730
Now, wait a minute.

477
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:39,231
Something is not right here.

478
00:16:39,231 --> 00:16:41,233
When has Frederick
ever expressed

479
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:43,736
the slightest desire
to see us together?

480
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:46,238
He could have been
sublimating it for years.

481
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:48,240
Yeah, even so,
he lied to both of us.

482
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,743
He had to have known
that we'd compare notes.

483
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:53,045
All right, so his plan
was a little artless.

484
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:56,248
Unless that's exactly
what he wanted.

485
00:16:56,248 --> 00:16:58,050
What do you mean?
Think about it.

486
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:00,386
He makes us believe
that he wants us together.

487
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:01,887
Of course,
we have to tell him

488
00:17:01,887 --> 00:17:03,255
that's not
going to happen.

489
00:17:03,255 --> 00:17:05,691
His hopes are dashed,
and we feel so guilty

490
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:09,595
that we compensate by getting
him something he wants.

491
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:11,397
A minibike?

492
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:14,533
That's a very clever
little boy we have.

493
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:17,736
God, could he actually
be so devious?

494
00:17:17,736 --> 00:17:19,104
Oh, well, if he wants
something badly enough,

495
00:17:19,638 --> 00:17:20,639
he will figure out a way
to get it.

496
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,640
Remember when he was a baby--

497
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:26,045
the bottle
at the end of the maze?

498
00:17:29,915 --> 00:17:33,285
You know, I kind of
regret doing that.

499
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:34,119
Frederick!

500
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,621
What are you
going to do,

501
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:36,622
just come out
and ask him?

502
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:39,124
No, of course not.
He'll only deny it.

503
00:17:39,124 --> 00:17:40,125
What, then?
(door opens)

504
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:41,627
Just go with me on this.
All right.

505
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:42,628
Frederick, have a seat.

506
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:44,129
We need to talk to you.

507
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:45,030
What about?

508
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:47,032
We know that
you've been trying

509
00:17:47,032 --> 00:17:50,436
to maneuver us together,
and it's only natural

510
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:52,704
for a child of divorce
to want that.

511
00:17:52,704 --> 00:17:55,107
Generally speaking,
your plan would be fruitless,

512
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:57,643
but when your father and I
let down our guard

513
00:17:57,643 --> 00:17:59,645
and looked at each other
in the candlelight,

514
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:03,148
we realized that
we belong together.

515
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:07,152
In other words...
we're getting remarried.

516
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:11,156
Do you really mean it?

517
00:18:14,326 --> 00:18:16,495
This is going to be
the best Christmas ever.

518
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:18,764
I'm going to go tell
Uncle Niles.

519
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,267
Have you lost
your mind?!

520
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:23,769
He's cooler
than I thought.

521
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,137
Cooler?

522
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:26,672
This isn't a game of poker.

523
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:30,609
This is our son being
lied to by his parents.

524
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:32,544
We've got to go in there,
tell him the truth,

525
00:18:32,544 --> 00:18:33,579
and make it up to him

526
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:35,080
even if it takes a fleet
of minibikes.

527
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,014
No, no, no,
Frasier.

528
00:18:36,014 --> 00:18:37,916
No, see, we called his bluff.

529
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:39,451
Now he's calling ours.

530
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:42,287
The question is,
what's our next move?

531
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:44,156
Oh, I know. Why don't we
just consult this handy

532
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:46,658
little guide for
divorced parents?

533
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,795
We can't blink first.

534
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,263
We've got to up the ante.

535
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,731
Good idea, Lilith.
You know what?

536
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:53,732
Let's go in there
and promise him

537
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:55,534
the baby brother
he'll never have!

538
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:05,377
What's this joyous news I hear?

539
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:07,746
You know, Frederick,

540
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:10,716
you're going to have
to give up all of your friends

541
00:19:10,716 --> 00:19:13,085
because we're going
to live here in Seattle.

542
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:16,321
I'd live anywhere
to be a family again.

543
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:18,457
So, it is true.

544
00:19:18,457 --> 00:19:19,758
Congratulations
to you both.

545
00:19:19,758 --> 00:19:21,260
Good night.

546
00:19:22,594 --> 00:19:24,229
Don't you want your coat,
Uncle Niles?

547
00:19:24,229 --> 00:19:26,365
No, thank you.

548
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:30,202
I'm going to go call
my friends.

549
00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:31,670
I love you.

550
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:34,173
I don't understand.

551
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,674
I was so sure.

552
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:38,210
Oh, gee, don't
be so tough on
yourself, Lilith.

553
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:41,213
After all, what parent doesn't,
at one time or another,

554
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:43,715
completely obliterate
their child's chances

555
00:19:43,715 --> 00:19:46,618
of ever trusting
another human being?

556
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:53,125
Ah, well, there he is,
telling his friends

557
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:55,060
that all his dreams
have come true.

558
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:59,398
Unless that's what
he wants us to think.

559
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:01,400
When will you stop?

560
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,935
FREDERICK:
It worked.

561
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:04,303
All I did was tap into

562
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:06,004
my parents'
feelings of inadequacy,

563
00:20:06,004 --> 00:20:06,838
and they crumbled.

564
00:20:06,838 --> 00:20:08,340
BOY:
What does that mean?

565
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,042
FREDERICK:
I'm getting a minibike.

566
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:13,512
Frederick.

567
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:14,913
Uh-oh.

568
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:16,815
(phone disconnects)

569
00:20:16,815 --> 00:20:21,253
Do I know my son,
or do I know my son?

570
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:24,223
He was willing to put us
through absolute hell

571
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,490
just for a minibike?

572
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:27,259
You know what
this means, don't you?

573
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:28,994
Yes, he's normal;
we're not bad parents.

574
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:30,829
Well done,
Dr. Sternin.

575
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:32,331
Well done, Dr. Crane.

576
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:34,733
(laughs)

577
00:20:36,868 --> 00:20:39,204
Well, we really
should get in there.

578
00:20:39,204 --> 00:20:40,606
Yes, I suppose
we should.

579
00:20:40,606 --> 00:20:42,407
Must be sheer torment for him

580
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:43,709
waiting for
the ax to fall.

581
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:45,244
Absolute hell.

582
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,512
Absolute nightmare.

583
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:49,114
Wine?

584
00:20:49,114 --> 00:20:50,215
Love some.
