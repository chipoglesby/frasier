1
00:00:07,474 --> 00:00:09,476
FRASIER:
Previously on Frasier...

2
00:00:09,476 --> 00:00:10,810
There is absolutely
no reason

3
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:13,213
this can't be connected
to some submerged anxiety.

4
00:00:13,213 --> 00:00:14,047
I mean, what's bothering you?

5
00:00:14,047 --> 00:00:15,849
The only women in my life
are friends.

6
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:17,684
Roz and Daphne.

7
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:19,019
Daphne's not even here anymore.

8
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:20,020
She'll be married soon.

9
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,489
It's been nice having her here.

10
00:00:23,456 --> 00:00:25,458
I really do love Daphne.

11
00:00:27,327 --> 00:00:28,995
DAPHNE:
It's about
Dr. Crane.

12
00:00:28,995 --> 00:00:32,198
I overheard him say
he's in love with me.

13
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:33,933
Geez, not this.

14
00:00:33,933 --> 00:00:35,468
You knew about this?

15
00:00:35,468 --> 00:00:36,970
I kept my mouth shut
for six years.

16
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:38,938
I'm not saying
anything now.

17
00:00:38,938 --> 00:00:40,874
Of course
I love you, Daphne,

18
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:43,276
but... as a friend, that's all.

19
00:00:43,276 --> 00:00:47,280
When I said to your father,
"Dr. Crane's in love with me,"

20
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,150
he said it's been going on
for six years now.

21
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:51,918
What did he mean by that?

22
00:00:51,918 --> 00:00:53,386
He meant Niles.

23
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:56,389
He's crazy about you.

24
00:01:00,593 --> 00:01:01,594
Oh, good Lord, Dad.

25
00:01:01,594 --> 00:01:03,596
You've been tinkering
with that thing for hours.

26
00:01:03,596 --> 00:01:04,597
Now, don't you think

27
00:01:05,098 --> 00:01:07,467
maybe Dancin' Santa
could sit this Christmas out?

28
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:10,737
Oh, I got to get him ready for
your big party tomorrow night.

29
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:12,072
(doorbell rings)
Oh, no need, Dad.

30
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:14,574
There'll be plenty of things
to delight my guests.

31
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:16,576
We'll be caroling
and playing games.

32
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:19,612
Oh, and I'll be reading
A Child's Christmas in Wales

33
00:01:19,612 --> 00:01:20,880
to bring the evening to a close.

34
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,982
Oh, that should do it.

35
00:01:22,982 --> 00:01:25,318
Hey, Frasier.
Oh, hello, Roz.

36
00:01:25,318 --> 00:01:26,319
Hey, Martin.
MARTIN:
Hey, Roz.

37
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:27,821
I can't stay.

38
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:29,322
I just stopped
by to drop off
your punchbowl.

39
00:01:29,322 --> 00:01:30,323
Well, thank you, Roz.

40
00:01:30,323 --> 00:01:33,193
Say, what kind of punch
did you serve?

41
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:35,061
Well, first I filled it
with ice.

42
00:01:35,061 --> 00:01:37,430
Then I just poured
orange juice and
vodka over it.

43
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:40,667
Well, Roz, that's
just a giant screwdriver.

44
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:45,305
Yeah... so, what am
I, Martha Stewart?

45
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:47,607
Fine. Thanks anyway.

46
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:48,641
You know, I'm really going
to be needing

47
00:01:48,641 --> 00:01:49,642
this bowl tomorrow evening.

48
00:01:49,642 --> 00:01:51,644
There's going to be
a crowd of guests.

49
00:01:51,644 --> 00:01:53,079
I've invited
the entire building,

50
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:55,148
including Cam Winston.
Oh...

51
00:01:55,148 --> 00:01:56,583
In the spirit of Christmas,
I've decided

52
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:58,051
to put an end to our feud.

53
00:01:58,051 --> 00:01:59,319
What are you feuding about?

54
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:02,222
Oh, he parks his SUV
right next to Frasier's Beemer.

55
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:05,191
Yes, well, that car is
grotesquely oversized.

56
00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:06,426
I've often
been forced

57
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:08,761
to exit from the passenger side.

58
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:12,665
Many a time, I've been brought
to grief on my gear shift.

59
00:02:12,665 --> 00:02:15,101
Why doesn't he just back in?

60
00:02:15,101 --> 00:02:16,102
Are you kidding?

61
00:02:16,102 --> 00:02:17,604
He can barely hit that space

62
00:02:17,604 --> 00:02:19,973
even when the guy's car
isn't there.

63
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:23,042
Hi, Roz.
ROZ:
Hey, Daphne.

64
00:02:23,042 --> 00:02:24,844
Bye, guys.
FRASIER:
Bye, Roz!

65
00:02:24,844 --> 00:02:26,312
You leaving?
ROZ:
Yeah.

66
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:29,749
Actually, there's something
I'd like to talk to you about.

67
00:02:29,749 --> 00:02:32,118
What is it?

68
00:02:32,118 --> 00:02:33,186
The other day,

69
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:35,121
I found out something
about Dr. Crane

70
00:02:35,121 --> 00:02:36,689
I wasn't supposed
to know.

71
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:37,690
Frasier?

72
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,025
No, his brother.

73
00:02:39,025 --> 00:02:41,861
Apparently, he's had a crush
on me for years.

74
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:44,564
(sighing):
Thank God.

75
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:46,132
What do you mean,
"thank God"?

76
00:02:46,132 --> 00:02:46,900
I've been afraid
for months

77
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,668
I'd be the one
to blow the secret.

78
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:49,836
You mean you knew?

79
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,571
Well, everybody
kind of did.

80
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:53,206
And nobody
said anything?

81
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:55,074
Well, if Niles wasn't ready
to say anything,

82
00:02:55,074 --> 00:02:56,543
it wasn't our place
to do it.

83
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:57,944
Well, who spilled
the beans?

84
00:02:57,944 --> 00:02:59,012
It was Frasier,
wasn't it?

85
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,480
Yeah, but he doesn't
know he told me.

86
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,015
He doesn't?
No, he was on

87
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,816
those painkillers
for his back, and...

88
00:03:03,816 --> 00:03:06,653
well, I can't very well
discuss it with Dr. Crane.

89
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:08,154
He's so close to Dr. Crane.

90
00:03:08,154 --> 00:03:09,622
If I told him,
he might tell Dr. Crane,

91
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:12,458
and then Dr. Crane
might feel embarrassed.

92
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:16,062
Yeah. Why confuse things?

93
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:18,431
The whole thing's
just a bit awkward.

94
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:20,133
Well, I don't see why.

95
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:21,467
Niles has
a girlfriend now,

96
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:23,436
so obviously
he's gotten over you,

97
00:03:23,436 --> 00:03:25,438
and you're engaged
to Donny.

98
00:03:25,438 --> 00:03:27,941
(chuckling):
I suppose when you
look at it like that,

99
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:30,276
there's really no
reason to feel awkward.

100
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,112
Well, there's
a Christmas tableau--

101
00:03:33,112 --> 00:03:34,514
naughty and nice.

102
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:37,417
Hello, Dr. Crane.

103
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:38,418
Hello, Daphne.

104
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:41,921
I'd see you inside,
but I just have to...

105
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:44,424
take out the garbage.

106
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:47,360
It's in my pockets.

107
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:53,266
Morning, everyone.

108
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:54,467
Hey, Niles.
Hello, Niles.

109
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:56,736
Frasier, I brought those
caroling books you asked for.

110
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,771
Ooh, thank you so much.

111
00:03:58,771 --> 00:04:00,273
Oh, yes, here we are.

112
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:01,307
(chuckling)

113
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:04,277
Preferred Songs from
a Victorian Christmas

114
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:06,312
and Elizabethan
Tidings of Joy.

115
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:07,814
Now we're ready
to party.

116
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:08,781
(laughing)

117
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:11,184
So, Niles, what
do you think?

118
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:12,552
Should we start
with the caroling

119
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:13,553
or should we hold off
until we've played

120
00:04:13,553 --> 00:04:15,455
a spirited game
of the Minister's Cat?

121
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:18,391
Start with the game.
Uh-huh.

122
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:19,392
Then the caroling.

123
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:20,893
Then perhaps
the guests will be ready

124
00:04:20,893 --> 00:04:22,161
for another game.

125
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:24,464
Yeah, Russian roulette.

126
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:27,467
Yes, well, I'm off.

127
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:29,969
Oh, Niles, if you're
not busy this evening,

128
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:31,971
perhaps you could help me
string popcorn garlands.

129
00:04:31,971 --> 00:04:33,973
Uh, unfortunately,
I have to see Maris tonight.

130
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:35,275
MARTIN:
Maris?

131
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,576
What the hell
do you have to see her for?

132
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:38,544
Sadly, to pay
my condolences.

133
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:40,546
It seems
our old gardener

134
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:41,948
has passed away
unexpectedly.

135
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,416
Oh, not Yoshi.

136
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:45,385
Gosh, that's too bad.

137
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:47,353
He had a heart attack
when he was out trimming

138
00:04:47,353 --> 00:04:50,356
Maris' elaborate
hedge maze.

139
00:04:50,356 --> 00:04:53,660
The paramedics
never had a chance.
No.

140
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:57,697
Well, I feel bad about Yoshi,
but are you sure

141
00:04:57,697 --> 00:04:59,565
it's a good idea
spending the evening with Maris?

142
00:04:59,565 --> 00:05:00,933
Well, she's
terribly upset.

143
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:02,435
Maris and Yoshi
were very close.

144
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:04,937
In fact, I remember
he once made

145
00:05:04,937 --> 00:05:05,938
a topiary likeness
of her

146
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:11,277
and wept without shame
when it developed root rot.

147
00:05:11,277 --> 00:05:12,879
Well...

148
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:15,181
the problem is
I have to cancel on Mel tonight.

149
00:05:15,181 --> 00:05:16,182
Oh, really?

150
00:05:16,182 --> 00:05:17,684
Well, Niles, if
you want my advice,

151
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:19,018
I wouldn't mention
Maris to Mel.

152
00:05:19,018 --> 00:05:20,853
What?

153
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:22,255
The last thing a new girlfriend
wants to hear

154
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:25,091
is that you're consoling
your ex-wife.

155
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:27,393
Well, I hate
to lie to Mel...

156
00:05:27,393 --> 00:05:28,928
although I do see
your point, Frasier.

157
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:30,229
(laughing):
Hey...

158
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:33,533
there he goes.

159
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,735
Dad, Santa's back.

160
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:36,669
MARTIN:
Yeah.

161
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:37,603
It's the darndest thing.

162
00:05:37,603 --> 00:05:39,105
Every year,
when I take him out of the box,

163
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:40,106
something's wrong with him,

164
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:41,607
but I always manage
to fix him again.

165
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:43,910
NILES:
Oh, good for you, Dad.

166
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:45,211
I told you to dunk it
under water.

167
00:05:45,211 --> 00:05:46,979
I did.

168
00:05:55,788 --> 00:05:56,789
KENNY:
Hey, Doc.

169
00:05:56,789 --> 00:05:59,692
Merry Christmas.
Oh, hi, Kenny. My!

170
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:01,561
The station has certainly
outdone itself this year

171
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:04,430
with the Christmas-
in-Mexico theme.

172
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,866
It was my idea.

173
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,334
It hit me when
I realized

174
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:09,869
their sauces are
red and green.

175
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,804
(laughing):
Ah, well...

176
00:06:11,804 --> 00:06:14,073
that's why you are
the boss.

177
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:15,875
(laughing)

178
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,677
Hey, Frasier,
what time's your
party tonight?

179
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:18,945
Shh! Please,
keep your voice down.

180
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:20,413
You're the only one
from the station I've invited.

181
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:22,315
The only one?
Yes.

182
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:23,783
Oh, don't worry,
there'll be scads of people,

183
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:26,185
because I invited everyone
in my building. 7:00.

184
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:27,453
Okay.
All right.

185
00:06:27,453 --> 00:06:28,654
Oh, Gil...

186
00:06:28,654 --> 00:06:29,522
Merry Christmas.

187
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:31,023
And to you,
Frasier.
Oh, thank you.

188
00:06:31,023 --> 00:06:32,525
I hope you saved
room for dessert.

189
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:34,026
Have you been baking?

190
00:06:34,026 --> 00:06:36,028
I have.

191
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:37,964
Gingerbread men.

192
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:42,802
Oh, my, and don't they look...
muscular?

193
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:44,704
Yes, well, the wife
and I made a new
year's resolution.

194
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:46,205
Mm-hmm.
Deb and I have
joined a gym

195
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:48,207
to slim down and buff up.

196
00:06:48,207 --> 00:06:49,709
We made these
to inspire us.

197
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:50,676
Ah, yes.

198
00:06:50,676 --> 00:06:52,612
Nothing strengthens
a dieter's resolve

199
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:54,614
like a good
motivational pastry.

200
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:56,616
(laughing)
Precisely.

201
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:58,117
Problem is, they're
so delicious,

202
00:06:58,117 --> 00:06:59,919
I've already had three.

203
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:04,223
This is my last
little man, I promise.

204
00:07:04,223 --> 00:07:08,161
Mm! Oh, Gil, who
are you kidding?

205
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:11,497
No one, Gil.

206
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:14,567
Frasier...

207
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:16,068
Mel?
Hello.

208
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:18,070
Well, gosh, I
never expected
to see you here.

209
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:20,072
Oh, well, I was
one of the doctors

210
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:22,875
on Health Chat
during cosmetic surgery week.

211
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:25,978
I did a segment
on breast augmentation.

212
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:27,547
Oh, how uplifting.

213
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:28,948
(laughing)

214
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,450
Yes, well...

215
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,885
Niles is hanging up
our coats.

216
00:07:32,885 --> 00:07:34,754
So, did you two have
a good dinner last night?

217
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:35,721
Oh, uh, no, no.

218
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:37,223
Actually, we didn't
have dinner last night.

219
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:38,724
I was too busy
planning my party.

220
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:39,725
But, please,
don't mention that

221
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:40,726
to any of my
colleagues.

222
00:07:40,726 --> 00:07:42,228
They're not invited.

223
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:43,563
Mel?

224
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:45,898
Frasier, Frasier,
glad I saw you.

225
00:07:45,898 --> 00:07:47,266
Listen, about last night--
if Mel should ask...

226
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:48,568
Oh, dear.

227
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:49,368
Oh, no.

228
00:07:49,368 --> 00:07:50,069
Oh, yes.

229
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:50,903
And you...?

230
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:52,405
I'm afraid so.

231
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:53,773
Damn you!

232
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:55,441
Well, I...
You're the one who
told me to lie to her.

233
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:57,276
Now you fail
to... back me up.

234
00:07:57,276 --> 00:07:58,277
Well, I'm
a little preoccupied.

235
00:07:58,277 --> 00:08:01,781
I'm having a party tonight
for 200 people!

236
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:05,785
Well, I won't
lie to you, Doc.

237
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:08,788
This hurts.

238
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:11,791
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

239
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,292
Oh, Mel, Mel, darling,
please...

240
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:14,794
darling, please, come
here, darling, sweetheart.

241
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:17,129
Niles, Niles...
I know you're upset,
darling, but listen.

242
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:18,498
Please, we're at a party.

243
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,899
All right, all
right, you're right.

244
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:20,766
Uh, we'll talk
about it later.

245
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:22,268
No, no, no,
we'll talk about it now.

246
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:25,705
Just put on
your party face.

247
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:27,273
Don't embarrass me...

248
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:29,775
as if I could be
further embarrassed

249
00:08:29,775 --> 00:08:31,277
after you lied to me.

250
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:32,144
I can explain.

251
00:08:32,144 --> 00:08:33,980
No, no, no, uh,
you don't need to.

252
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,515
When a man lies
about where he's been,

253
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,016
it's not hard
to guess the reason.

254
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:39,018
So, what's
the little whore's name?

255
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:41,020
(chuckling)

256
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,022
No, no, no, darling,
the reason I told you

257
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,524
that I was dining
with Frasier

258
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,526
was actually,
I was out...

259
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,394
Yes?

260
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:51,097
...getting your
Christmas present.

261
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:52,398
My present?
Uh-huh.

262
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:54,901
Oh, darling,
I'm so sorry.

263
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:56,369
I-I should've known.

264
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:57,303
(laughing)
Oh!

265
00:08:57,303 --> 00:08:59,305
I'm so glad you're
forgiving me.

266
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:00,306
(both laughing)

267
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:01,807
Or is that your
party face?

268
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:03,576
Oh, no, no.

269
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:05,811
Of course not, darling.

270
00:09:05,811 --> 00:09:08,281
So, why don't you, um,
hang my coat back up...
All right.

271
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:09,782
and I'll get us
something to drink.

272
00:09:09,782 --> 00:09:11,651
Of course.

273
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:13,419
FRASIER:
Oh, Mel...

274
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:14,887
uh, this is awkward, uh...

275
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:16,289
MEL:
Oh, no, no,
no, Frasier.

276
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:18,958
Niles explained
everything,

277
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:21,193
and while I don't
like being lied to,

278
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:22,995
I do appreciate
why he did it.

279
00:09:22,995 --> 00:09:23,796
FRASIER:
Oh, I'm so glad.

280
00:09:23,796 --> 00:09:25,631
Ooh, hello.

281
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:26,933
Darling.

282
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:28,901
Hello. Chatting,
are we?

283
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:31,337
Well, actually,
I was just apologizing

284
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:33,739
for my part
in your little misunderstanding.

285
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,575
Oh, yes, well, then,
of course you were
discussing the present?

286
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:36,509
Oh, yes, yes,

287
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:38,377
the present... and the future.

288
00:09:38,377 --> 00:09:40,279
Maris is all in the past.

289
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:42,148
(chuckling)

290
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:43,115
Maris?

291
00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:44,350
Oh, dear.

292
00:09:45,117 --> 00:09:48,621
You were with Maris
last night?

293
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:51,057
Well...
How dare you?

294
00:09:52,491 --> 00:09:55,394
Anything else in the box,
Pandora?

295
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:01,400
Mel, please.
Oh, no,
don't touch me, no.

296
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,668
Party face, party face.

297
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:05,004
No, no, forget
the party face.

298
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:07,740
You're obviously still...
in love with her,

299
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,609
and I'm not
about to share you,

300
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:13,112
so... good-bye.

301
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:15,114
FRASIER:
Niles, Niles,
I'm so sorry.

302
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,616
Oh, Frasier,
don't pretend to be sorry.

303
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,618
All you care about
is your precious party

304
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:21,587
that you're hosting
tonight!

305
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:36,469
("Jingle Bells"
playing on piano)

306
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,904
Okay, honey, get ready.

307
00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:43,075
Don't be nervous.

308
00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:47,013
Okay, bring it
on home, Daphne!

309
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:49,015
(plays final chord)
Yes!

310
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:50,516
Daphne Moon, everybody!

311
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:53,219
FRASIER:
Brava!

312
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:54,987
Okay, we're taking requests.

313
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:57,056
How about a little
"Silent Night"?

314
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:00,593
FRASIER:
Stop that!
Wha...?

315
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:01,961
Those are for the party.

316
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:04,764
In case you haven't noticed,
I am the party.

317
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:07,566
Yeah, Frasier,
didn't the invitation say 7:00?

318
00:11:07,566 --> 00:11:09,535
I hope people knew
it was for tonight.

319
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:10,503
Stop worrying.
They'll be here.

320
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:11,971
I mean, they're probably
just fashionably late.

321
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:12,905
I mean, people do love to make

322
00:11:12,905 --> 00:11:13,906
an entrance, you know.

323
00:11:13,906 --> 00:11:15,274
(doorbell rings)
A-ha!

324
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:20,012
Daphne, open the floodgates.

325
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:24,216
NILES:
Hello.

326
00:11:24,216 --> 00:11:26,152
Good evening, Dr. Crane.

327
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:27,153
Isn't Mel with you?

328
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:29,188
Uh, no, she
won't be coming.

329
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:30,523
We broke up.

330
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:31,657
What?

331
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:33,225
NILES:
Yeah, uh,
this afternoon.

332
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:34,493
Oh, goodness,
I'm so sorry.

333
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:35,895
Did you try to call her, Niles?

334
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:37,329
Oh, I left a
dozen messages.

335
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:38,230
DONNY:
Aw, Niles,
I'm so sorry.

336
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:40,566
How long were you guys together?

337
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:42,334
Oh, not that long.

338
00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:44,804
Still, I was optimistic.

339
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:46,272
Well, did you talk
about moving in together?

340
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:48,040
Made any long-term plans?

341
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:52,078
This is really bringing out
the lawyer in you, isn't it?

342
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:53,345
The bartender, actually.

343
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:54,313
I was just wondering

344
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:57,316
how big a drink
to make you.
Ah. Big.

345
00:11:57,316 --> 00:11:58,317
Scotch, please.

346
00:11:58,317 --> 00:11:59,285
All right, come on,
don't worry, Niles.

347
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:00,820
We'll fix you up
with somebody.

348
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,321
Oh, uh, thanks, Donny.

349
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:03,322
I don't think
this is the time

350
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:04,824
for me to be meeting
someone new.

351
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:07,326
Someone old, then;
you know, an old flame...

352
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:08,661
an ex-girlfriend,

353
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:10,396
someone who got away, huh?

354
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,198
Now, come on, Niles,

355
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:13,032
there must
have been somebody

356
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:14,567
you had your eye on
before Mel.

357
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:15,968
Donny, please!

358
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:18,370
Can't you see
you're making him uncomfortable?

359
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:19,872
What? I was just
trying to help.

360
00:12:19,872 --> 00:12:20,873
Honey?

361
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:22,374
See, Niles, it's not
us, it's the holidays.

362
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:25,711
It makes women crazy.

363
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,356
Ha-ha! Hello, everyone!

364
00:12:37,356 --> 00:12:38,724
Come in! Come in!

365
00:12:38,724 --> 00:12:40,159
Oh, yes, that's
very nice.

366
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:43,095
Ladies first. All right, now,
no crowding, no pushing.

367
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:44,597
(laughing)

368
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:48,834
Where are they going?

369
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:51,237
I've got bad
news for you.

370
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:53,239
That feud you
were having with
the guy upstairs?

371
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:54,240
It isn't over.

372
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,241
He's having
his own party.

373
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:57,243
Damn him!

374
00:12:57,743 --> 00:13:00,012
He's siphoning
off my guests.

375
00:13:00,012 --> 00:13:01,781
You know, you won't
believe this.

376
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:05,251
That dreadful Cam Winston
is having a competing party!

377
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:06,619
DONNY:
Oh,that's
what that was.

378
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:09,021
I saw a big sign in the lobby:
"Winston Party 2000."

379
00:13:09,021 --> 00:13:10,956
Yes. That's his
apartment number.

380
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:14,426
Well, two can play
at that game.

381
00:13:14,426 --> 00:13:15,427
Donny?
DONNY:
Yeah?

382
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:17,263
Do me a favor, will you?

383
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:18,397
Make me one
of those signs.

384
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:19,231
See what you can fashion

385
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:20,733
out of these
crude implements.

386
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:22,234
Okay, I'll try.

387
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:24,570
MARTIN:
I don't know if that's
a good idea, Fras.

388
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,438
FRASIER:
Why?
Well, "Winston Party 2000"

389
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:28,440
sounds like the
party of the future.

390
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,910
"Crane Party 1901"...

391
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:33,112
sounds like...

392
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:35,281
well, this.

393
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:37,683
I wouldn't worry
about it, Frasier.

394
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:39,485
You always throw
a good party.

395
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,220
This place will be hopping
in no time.

396
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,054
FRASIER:
Thanks, Roz.

397
00:13:42,054 --> 00:13:45,457
Hey, Connie, it's a morgue here.

398
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:48,894
Is the party at the station
still happening?

399
00:13:48,894 --> 00:13:51,931
Great. I'll be there
as soon as I can.

400
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:53,299
Oh, hey, Daphne.

401
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:55,134
You're not going
to believe this.

402
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:56,569
Dr. Crane broke up
with Mel.

403
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:58,470
Oh, yeah, I know. I heard.

404
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:01,674
Is there anything
you don't know before I do?

405
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,876
I overheard them
at the office Christmas party.

406
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:04,944
Really? What happened?

407
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:08,214
Well, okay...
don't freak out.

408
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:09,014
Mel accused Niles

409
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:10,950
of still being in love
with someone else.

410
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:13,886
Oh, my God, that's me!
I'm "someone."

411
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:14,720
I said not
to freak out.

412
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,488
But what if he says something
to me?

413
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:17,957
Just let him down gently.

414
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:19,892
Oh, it never works out
that easily.

415
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:22,127
You know what happens
when you say no to a guy.

416
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:24,930
Yeah. Sure.

417
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:28,200
It just gets messy
after that.

418
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,202
You say you'll be friends,
but you never are.

419
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:31,637
It ruins everything.

420
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:33,572
He's not going to
say anything tonight.

421
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:35,541
As long as Donny's here,
you're totally safe.

422
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,476
Let's find a prominent
place to put this...

423
00:14:37,476 --> 00:14:41,814
preferably right on top
of Winston's sign.

424
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:43,616
Oh, go easy there,
Niles.

425
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:46,385
Oh, haven't you
given me enough
advice for one day?

426
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:48,153
(oven bell rings)
My canapes!

427
00:14:48,153 --> 00:14:51,156
You know, Niles, you look
like you need cheering up.

428
00:14:51,156 --> 00:14:52,157
Oh!
Oh, no! Oh, no!

429
00:14:52,157 --> 00:14:54,159
Oh, darn, I'm sorry.

430
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:55,661
Daphne's present.

431
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:57,029
Did it break?

432
00:14:57,029 --> 00:14:59,965
(broken pieces clattering)

433
00:14:59,965 --> 00:15:04,436
Well, we won't know
till she opens it.

434
00:15:04,436 --> 00:15:06,405
I'm sorry...
but, hey, look.

435
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,707
You don't need this one
for Mel, do you?

436
00:15:08,707 --> 00:15:10,809
Well, I guess not.
Oh, okay, well, here.

437
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:13,545
Switch that in there
for this right here.

438
00:15:13,545 --> 00:15:15,080
Problem solved.

439
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:15,948
All right,
now, you two,

440
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:17,349
I don't want everyone
congregating

441
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:18,350
in the kitchen.

442
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:20,853
Now, go out
and mingle!

443
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:25,357
Niles! Martin!
I didn't see you come in.

444
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:26,792
Roz! Daphne!

445
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:29,094
Well, I didn't want

446
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:31,030
to give these out
in front of all the guests,

447
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,998
but since there
aren't any... here you go.

448
00:15:32,998 --> 00:15:34,500
Roz, that's for you,

449
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,935
and, uh, Daphne, here.

450
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,670
Uh... Merry Christmas.

451
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,505
Oh, Merry Christmas.
Thank you, Dr. Crane.

452
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:40,506
Thank you.
(phone ringing)

453
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:42,508
Excuse me.

454
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:44,009
Hello?

455
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:47,513
Oh, no. It's jewelry.

456
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:51,016
Oh, no. It's a book.

457
00:15:53,018 --> 00:15:55,888
My God, there must be
100 people up there.

458
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:58,257
Well, I'll just show you
what you're missing!

459
00:15:58,257 --> 00:16:01,760
Savory lamb tenders!

460
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:05,230
Pesto-filled mushroom caps!

461
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:07,266
Smell 'em and weep!

462
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:08,767
Come on, come on,
Frasier.

463
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:10,769
Maybe we ought
to walk you back inside.

464
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:12,538
Oh, Dad...

465
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:13,806
There you go.

466
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,808
Yes. Yes, darling,
that's wonderful.

467
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,310
I'll see you soon.

468
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,311
That was Mel.

469
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,612
And?

470
00:16:20,612 --> 00:16:22,381
I managed to explain
about Yoshi.

471
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:23,382
She's on her way over.

472
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:25,284
FRASIER:
Oh, thank God.
I know.

473
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:27,019
Another guest!

474
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:30,456
It's also wonderful for you,
Niles-- congratulations.

475
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:32,858
Well, there is
one minor detail
to be ironed out.

476
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:34,360
Yes?
I also got a
message from Maris

477
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,260
saying she wants
to see me again.

478
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,562
I think she
may have

479
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:39,465
mistaken last night's sympathy
for affection.

480
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:40,466
FRASIER:
Oh, my.

481
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:41,934
Well, Niles,
if you want my advice...

482
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:44,636
Ooh, you know, you really need
to stop saying that.

483
00:16:44,636 --> 00:16:46,505
You've got to make
your feelings clear to her,

484
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:47,539
and the sooner,
the better.

485
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:49,008
I mean, there's
very little point

486
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,843
in letting it drag on
like this.
You're right.

487
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,878
I'll speak to
her tonight.

488
00:16:52,878 --> 00:16:54,146
At the moment,
I just want

489
00:16:54,146 --> 00:16:55,647
to patch things
up with Mel.

490
00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:56,615
Uh-huh. Well, you know,

491
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:57,649
those antique earrings
you bought her

492
00:16:57,649 --> 00:16:58,951
should go a long way
toward that.

493
00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:00,185
(groaning):
Oh...

494
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:01,987
I gave them to Daphne.

495
00:17:01,987 --> 00:17:03,088
You did what?

496
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:04,923
Daphne's gift broke, and...

497
00:17:04,923 --> 00:17:06,925
I didn't think Mel was coming.

498
00:17:06,925 --> 00:17:08,827
Dad suggested
I switch the gift cards.

499
00:17:08,827 --> 00:17:11,697
Oh, for God's sake,
Dad and his meddling.

500
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:12,698
Well, if you want my advice...

501
00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:16,235
...you know where
to find me.

502
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:20,806
Roz!
What?

503
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:22,307
You can't go.
Why not?

504
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:24,610
NILES:
Daphne, I'm sorry
to interrupt.

505
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:26,378
Uh, I need to
speak with you.

506
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:28,347
It's a private
matter. Uh...

507
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:30,783
Would you join me on the balcony
for a moment?

508
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:31,683
All right.

509
00:17:31,683 --> 00:17:33,152
Thank you.

510
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:36,755
Whoa, he's going
to tell you.

511
00:17:36,755 --> 00:17:41,060
(sarcastically):
Oh,no.Not tonight.
Not while Donny's here.

512
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,494
Okay, so I was wrong.

513
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:44,496
Boy, this is rough.

514
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:45,898
What are you going to do?

515
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:48,801
I don't know.

516
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:51,203
I guess I won't
give him the chance.

517
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:53,138
I'll speak first.
I'll just be direct.

518
00:17:53,138 --> 00:17:55,641
I'll... I'll tell him
I know how he feels about me

519
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:57,643
but I don't feel that way
about him.

520
00:17:58,143 --> 00:17:59,645
I love Donny, and...

521
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:02,014
nothing's going
to happen between us.

522
00:18:02,014 --> 00:18:03,348
Good...

523
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:05,851
luck.

524
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:11,290
Hi.
Daphne, uh...

525
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:13,358
I wish there were an
easier way to say this.

526
00:18:13,358 --> 00:18:14,827
I...
Wait.

527
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:17,830
I have something
that I'd like to say first.

528
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:21,633
Dr. Crane, I have
to tell you that...

529
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:24,436
Oh, Daphne, I
am so sorry.

530
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,405
What am I thinking?

531
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:27,739
Here.
Oh.

532
00:18:27,739 --> 00:18:30,042
Well, thank you.

533
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:34,847
Anyway, Dr. Crane...

534
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:37,349
I know that...

535
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:40,853
Yes?

536
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:43,856
I'm sorry. I...

537
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:46,825
Look, uh, why don't
I start. Uh...

538
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:47,826
No, Dr. Crane.

539
00:18:47,826 --> 00:18:49,328
No, no, I really
need to say this.

540
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:50,696
I can't wait any
longer. Daphne...

541
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:52,831
Yes?
Uh...

542
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:54,566
This is so
difficult for me.

543
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:56,502
Yes?

544
00:18:58,036 --> 00:19:00,873
I need my Christmas
present back.

545
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:03,675
You what?

546
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:07,679
People will go
almost anywhere

547
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,549
for free food
and booze.

548
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:13,752
Am I really so insufferable?

549
00:19:13,752 --> 00:19:15,053
I could call the station

550
00:19:15,053 --> 00:19:17,422
and see if people
want to come over.

551
00:19:17,422 --> 00:19:19,258
Oh, yes, Roz, let's call in
the second-string guests.

552
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:23,629
Let's fill my home with a bunch
of angry, snubbed coworkers.

553
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,466
You think they'd come?

554
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:29,401
Ah!
Hey-hey!

555
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:30,936
Hi! Merry Christmas!

556
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:32,437
See? Fashionably late!

557
00:19:32,437 --> 00:19:33,438
Hello, everyone!

558
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:34,940
Come in! Merry Christmas!

559
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,942
Help yourself
to some drinks.

560
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:38,277
Okay, Marty,

561
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:39,645
how'd you get these
people down here?

562
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:41,146
Oh, I just called an old buddy
in the fire department

563
00:19:41,146 --> 00:19:42,648
and told them
that that many people

564
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:44,149
in one place
had to be a code violation.

565
00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:45,651
Oh, that is smart, but
aren't there going to be

566
00:19:45,651 --> 00:19:46,652
the same number of
people down here?

567
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:47,586
All right, everyone,

568
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:49,555
we'll start by
singing some carols,

569
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:51,990
and then we'll
choose up teams for
the Minister's Cat.

570
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:54,927
I don't think
that's going to be a problem.

571
00:19:56,595 --> 00:19:58,864
I feel terrible about this,

572
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:01,300
and-and, of course,
I'll-I'll replace the gift.

573
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,268
Oh, that's all right.

574
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:07,005
Well, I won't
be needing this anymore.

575
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:09,841
Right. Oh, Daphne,
Daphne, Daphne...

576
00:20:09,841 --> 00:20:12,177
you never finished
what you were going to say.

577
00:20:12,177 --> 00:20:16,615
Oh, well... it was
about the gift.

578
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:18,116
Well, I could see
from the box

579
00:20:18,116 --> 00:20:20,118
that you got me jewelry
from Beadie & Sons,

580
00:20:20,118 --> 00:20:23,622
and I didn't get you anything
nearly as grand.

581
00:20:23,622 --> 00:20:26,124
Well...
doesn't matter now.

582
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:29,394
Oh. Mel...

583
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:30,195
She's here.

584
00:20:30,195 --> 00:20:32,197
Yes, uh... excuse me.

585
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:40,372
I'm so glad you came.

586
00:20:40,372 --> 00:20:41,673
Uh...

587
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:43,875
Merry Christmas.

588
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,043
Merry Christmas.

589
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:50,015
So, how'd it go?
Did you tell him?

590
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:52,884
I never got the chance.
He went first.

591
00:20:52,884 --> 00:20:54,386
It turns out he'd
just given me the wrong gift

592
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:55,354
and wanted it back.

593
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:56,355
You're kidding.

594
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:58,257
You must be
so relieved.

595
00:20:58,257 --> 00:20:59,658
(chuckling):
Oh, I'll say.

596
00:20:59,658 --> 00:21:02,127
I've never been
so relieved in my life.

597
00:21:02,127 --> 00:21:05,430
