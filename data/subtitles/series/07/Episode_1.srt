1
00:00:07,574 --> 00:00:09,509
This is exactly
why I hate fix-ups.

2
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:10,577
She's not coming.

3
00:00:10,577 --> 00:00:12,579
Just give her
a few more minutes.

4
00:00:12,579 --> 00:00:14,581
Come on,
tell me about the cabin.

5
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:15,448
Oh, all right.
Uh...

6
00:00:15,448 --> 00:00:16,316
Well, Mom and Dad used

7
00:00:16,316 --> 00:00:18,385
to take us up there
when we were kids.

8
00:00:18,385 --> 00:00:19,386
Niles and I thought

9
00:00:19,386 --> 00:00:21,321
it might be a nice birthday gift
for Dad

10
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:23,056
if we took him
up there again.

11
00:00:23,056 --> 00:00:24,424
Oh, this is ridiculous.

12
00:00:24,424 --> 00:00:25,925
I'm being stood up
on a blind date.

13
00:00:25,925 --> 00:00:26,926
I'm pathetic.

14
00:00:26,926 --> 00:00:27,894
You are so insecure.

15
00:00:27,894 --> 00:00:29,396
God, where does that come from?

16
00:00:29,396 --> 00:00:31,197
Jessica will be here.

17
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:33,466
"Jessica"? I thought you said
her name was "Jennifer."
Jennifer?

18
00:00:33,466 --> 00:00:35,402
Jennifer goes out
with a weatherman.

19
00:00:35,402 --> 00:00:36,836
She's way out of your league.

20
00:00:36,836 --> 00:00:38,738
Look, let me have
your cell phone.

21
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:41,241
I'll call her
and see what's going on.

22
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:43,710
Frasier?

23
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:44,677
Oh, I'm sorry, Roz.

24
00:00:44,677 --> 00:00:46,946
The most striking woman
just came in.

25
00:00:46,946 --> 00:00:47,714
Well, it's probably Jessica.

26
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:48,648
No, no, no,
it's not Jessica.

27
00:00:49,115 --> 00:00:50,016
She's with a man.

28
00:00:50,016 --> 00:00:52,786
God, I don't know
what it is about her.

29
00:00:52,786 --> 00:00:54,654
I can't take my eyes
off of her.

30
00:00:54,654 --> 00:00:56,122
Do you suppose they're a couple?

31
00:00:56,122 --> 00:00:57,357
No, no-- don't...!

32
00:00:57,357 --> 00:00:59,159
I'll tell you what--
you have to go

33
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:01,094
over there for me and find out.

34
00:01:01,094 --> 00:01:02,295
What?
You owe me.
Come on.

35
00:01:02,295 --> 00:01:04,564
All right, it's that table
right by the counter.

36
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:05,965
Go on.
Oh, all right.

37
00:01:05,965 --> 00:01:07,934
(whispering loudly):
No, Roz, Roz.

38
00:01:07,934 --> 00:01:09,869
That's the wrong table.

39
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:10,804
Excuse me.

40
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:12,605
I know this is
a little weird,

41
00:01:12,605 --> 00:01:15,341
but my friend over
there thinks you're
really, really cute.

42
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:17,277
He wanted to know if
you two were on a date.

43
00:01:17,277 --> 00:01:19,612
"A date"? Oh, no,
Hank and I are just friends.

44
00:01:19,612 --> 00:01:21,748
ROZ:
Oh, that's good news.

45
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:23,016
That's really
good news.

46
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:24,017
Hi, Hank.

47
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:25,351
I'm Roz Doyle.

48
00:01:32,692 --> 00:01:34,694
Uh, excuse me.

49
00:01:34,694 --> 00:01:36,729
Uh...

50
00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:39,732
I suppose you noticed I-I
was staring at your table,

51
00:01:39,732 --> 00:01:41,668
and I was just, uh,
wondering if, um...

52
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:44,070
that gentlemen you're with,
i-is he your husband?

53
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:44,971
Oh, no.

54
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:46,539
Oh. Uh, boyfriend?

55
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:47,373
No.

56
00:01:47,373 --> 00:01:48,675
Oh, wonderful.

57
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:50,176
Would you like me
to introduce you?

58
00:01:50,176 --> 00:01:51,444
He just broke up
with someone.

59
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:53,213
No, no-no-no, uh...

60
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:57,050
no, I-I was, uh...
I was staring at you.

61
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:57,851
You were?

62
00:01:57,851 --> 00:01:59,119
Yes.

63
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,387
Gosh, I know this may
seem awfully bold of me.

64
00:02:01,387 --> 00:02:02,388
I-I'm not the sort of man

65
00:02:02,388 --> 00:02:04,891
who hits on every
woman he sees...
Excuse me.

66
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:08,328
Hi, um, your friend said
you wanted to know

67
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:10,230
if I was single.

68
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:12,432
It's okay-- you don't
have to be embarrassed.

69
00:02:12,432 --> 00:02:13,733
Yes, he does.

70
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:15,168
(chuckling):
No.

71
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:17,170
There's been
a little mistake.

72
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:18,104
You see, I asked my friend

73
00:02:18,104 --> 00:02:19,572
to approach
this lovely woman,

74
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:21,574
and she obviously mistook you
for the woman I meant.

75
00:02:21,574 --> 00:02:23,576
Well, that's certainly
understandable,

76
00:02:23,576 --> 00:02:24,577
seeing as you're lovely
as well.

77
00:02:24,577 --> 00:02:26,579
You see, it's just that
at this moment, that's...

78
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,014
Well, I'm, uh...
many apologies.

79
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:29,082
(chuckling)

80
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:30,083
Gosh, I'm sorry.

81
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:31,084
Let me start again.

82
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:32,051
I'm Frasier Crane.

83
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:33,553
Oh, you're Frasier.

84
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:36,022
Oh.
Hi. I'm Jessica,
Roz's friend.

85
00:02:36,022 --> 00:02:37,457
Jessica.

86
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:38,291
Roz thought

87
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:39,993
we might hit it off.

88
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:42,362
Indeed, we might have,
you see, if not for the fact

89
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:44,364
that I've-I've just met
this, uh, woman

90
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:45,865
to whom I'd be glad
to introduce you,

91
00:02:45,865 --> 00:02:47,867
except I-I don't know
what her name is yet, so, uh...

92
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:50,370
You know,
Roz could explain all this.

93
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,872
Uh, she's sitting over there
next to that scowling woman.

94
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:55,241
(chuckles awkwardly)

95
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:56,576
Gosh, you know,
you must think

96
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:58,077
I'm some sort of
a smooth operator.

97
00:02:58,077 --> 00:02:59,579
No, not really.

98
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:01,014
Ah.

99
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:05,919
I-I really am...
terribly sorry, uh...

100
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:07,887
I'm Mia,
Mia Preston.

101
00:03:07,887 --> 00:03:09,389
Mia...
Mia Preston?

102
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:10,823
The children's
book author?

103
00:03:10,823 --> 00:03:12,592
Yes.
Oh, my goodness.

104
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:13,860
Panda in the Parlor?

105
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,328
Oh, wow, I love that book.

106
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,197
I've read it a hundred times.

107
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,064
I'm impressed.

108
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:20,567
Most of my readers
can't even count that high.

109
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:22,969
Oh, no, no, no.
No, I-I used to
read it to my son.

110
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:24,404
You know, many is
the quart of milk

111
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:25,905
we poured in the backyard

112
00:03:25,905 --> 00:03:27,774
waiting for the
Oreo tree to grow.

113
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:29,042
Gosh, you know, I'd...

114
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:31,311
I'd love to take you
to lunch sometime.

115
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:32,612
Lunch? Um...

116
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:33,980
Well, all right, coffee?

117
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,849
Anything. I-I'd just
like a chance to get
to know you better.

118
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:38,318
Well, I... okay.

119
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:40,787
You're certainly persistent.

120
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:42,755
Well, a wise woman
once wrote,

121
00:03:42,755 --> 00:03:44,757
"No cookie jar
is up too high

122
00:03:44,757 --> 00:03:47,260
for a panda who
will try and try."

123
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,261
(chuckling)

124
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:49,596
(chuckles nervously)

125
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:51,431
Now you're scaring me.

126
00:03:55,868 --> 00:03:57,937
(door opens)

127
00:03:57,937 --> 00:03:59,405
MARTIN:
Hey, Daph.

128
00:04:00,873 --> 00:04:04,310
I see you're wearing
your buffet pants.

129
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,645
They're hip waders.

130
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:08,147
I'm breaking them in
for the weekend.

131
00:04:08,147 --> 00:04:09,549
Where's Fras?

132
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:11,417
He's probably off somewhere
with that Mia.

133
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:13,353
Oh, yeah, seems to be
getting serious, huh?

134
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:15,688
You know, it's funny,
you can always tell.

135
00:04:15,688 --> 00:04:18,024
Starts using French words
for no reason.

136
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:19,492
Yeah, and that laugh,
the giddy one.

137
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:21,261
(both imitate giddy laugh)

138
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,428
FRASIER:
After you, Niles.

139
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:23,296
Thank you.

140
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:24,364
Hello, all.

141
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:26,366
Well, there's
afaux pasaverted.

142
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:29,369
I almost wore
my big rubber pants today.

143
00:04:30,703 --> 00:04:32,005
They're for the trip.

144
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:33,006
I'm nearly done packing.

145
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:36,009
I've just got to get my
fly vest and my tackle box

146
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:37,377
and there's
one more thing.

147
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:39,646
Well, we're taking off
in a few hours, sodepeche-toi.

148
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:42,448
Oh, yeah, earplugs
for the car ride up-- thank you.

149
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:43,816
Oh, uh, Dad,
don't forget

150
00:04:43,816 --> 00:04:46,085
to pack some
sturdy knee socks.

151
00:04:46,085 --> 00:04:47,353
I should get some for myself.

152
00:04:47,353 --> 00:04:48,855
You remember
the insect situation

153
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:50,123
at the cabin.

154
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,391
Good Lord, Niles,

155
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:53,359
not this bug phobia
of yours.

156
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:54,827
It's not a phobia.

157
00:04:54,827 --> 00:04:56,829
The mosquitoes up there
are huge.

158
00:04:56,829 --> 00:04:59,332
My first summer, I was chased
off the end of the dock

159
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:01,100
by one the size of a pelican.

160
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:04,937
So, Dr. Crane,
when do we finally get to meet

161
00:05:04,937 --> 00:05:06,372
this new girlfriend of yours?
Oh, Mia.

162
00:05:06,372 --> 00:05:07,807
Well, she's on her way
over here right now.

163
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:10,176
She says she's gonna take me
out to buy some new trousers.

164
00:05:10,176 --> 00:05:12,045
You see,
this new diet she's got me on...

165
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:15,048
I've lost my love handles...
just when I needed them most.

166
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:16,316
(laughing giddily)

167
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,752
So, Niles, Niles,
you got those movies?

168
00:05:19,752 --> 00:05:21,688
Shh. Yes.
Here they are.
Thank you.

169
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:22,522
Movies?

170
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:23,489
Yes, shh.
Shh-shh-shh.

171
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:24,791
For Dad's birthday.

172
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:26,626
We had some
of his old home movies

173
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:28,127
transferred to videotape.

174
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:30,563
God, you know, I haven't
seen these in years.

175
00:05:30,563 --> 00:05:31,831
You know, Daphne, it's gonna
be quite a hoot this weekend.

176
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:34,033
You sure you don't
want to join us?

177
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:35,668
(doorbell rings)
Gutting fish,
watching home movies

178
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:38,371
and hosing down
your father's pants...

179
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:41,140
It does sound tempting.

180
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,075
(laughing)

181
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:43,076
Oh...

182
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:44,077
Hi, honey.

183
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:45,078
Hi, Mia.

184
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:46,079
Hi.

185
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:47,580
Gosh, come on in.
Come on in.

186
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:48,915
This is
Daphne Moon.

187
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:51,050
And that's
my brother, Niles.

188
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:53,853
Oh, it's great
to finally meet you two.

189
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,221
DAPHNE:
Likewise.

190
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:56,222
So, what do you
got there?

191
00:05:56,723 --> 00:05:57,724
Oh, I baked some
fat-free goodies

192
00:05:57,724 --> 00:05:58,991
for your trip.

193
00:05:58,991 --> 00:05:59,759
Oh.
Where's the kitchen?

194
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:00,760
Oh, right this way.

195
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,261
And there's a
ton of muffins,

196
00:06:02,261 --> 00:06:03,763
if anybody
wants one.

197
00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:04,764
Oh, uh, not for me.

198
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:06,566
I have some problems
with allergies.

199
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:08,668
Really? Well, these are just
wheat germ, oat bran and carob.

200
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:09,969
Oh, well,
throw in a sea scallop,

201
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:11,904
you can call the paramedics
right now.

202
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:17,343
She seems nice,
doesn't she?

203
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,845
You all right,
Dr. Crane?

204
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:21,347
I'm sorry, Daphne,
it's just that...

205
00:06:21,347 --> 00:06:23,850
Mia looks exactly
like our mother.

206
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,351
Mrs. Crane?

207
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:27,820
I've only seen photos,
mind, but

208
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,756
now that you mention it,
there is a resemblance.

209
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:31,257
No, it's not just
a resemblance.

210
00:06:31,257 --> 00:06:32,759
She is the spitting image.

211
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:36,562
I'm... I'm shocked
Frasier didn't mention it.

212
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:38,398
So, what do you
think of her?

213
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,399
Oh...

214
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,868
she's wonderful,
but, Frasier...

215
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:42,835
Hmm?

216
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:47,340
Does she remind
you of anyone?

217
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,708
Oh, you noticed that, too?
Are you kidding?

218
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:50,710
From the minute
I laid eyes on her.

219
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:51,677
Even I can see it.

220
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:53,646
Really? Well, she does
look a bit like Roz,

221
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:55,081
but she's a totally
different person.

222
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,449
You know,

223
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:58,351
in fact,
our relationship is unlike

224
00:06:58,351 --> 00:07:00,353
any I've ever had before.

225
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:01,320
Come on, handsome.

226
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,822
Let's go buy
you some pants.
Ooh, okay.

227
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:18,905
Oh, wow... look at this.

228
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:21,841
I don't believe it.

229
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:24,844
Nothing's changed.

230
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:26,679
Niles?

231
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:30,917
Wow, I don't believe it.

232
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:34,921
Look at this, nothing's changed.

233
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:36,889
It's character, Niles.

234
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:38,891
Look at this fireplace.

235
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:40,893
Ah, your mom and I
used to sit

236
00:07:40,893 --> 00:07:43,863
in front of the fire here
holding hands.

237
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:46,399
And I wonder if that...

238
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:47,900
Oh, yep, it's still here--

239
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,670
that graffiti that you
scratched into the floor.

240
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:51,938
That's not graffiti, Dad.

241
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:53,940
That's a Latin pun:
"Semper ubi sub ubi--"

242
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,375
"Always where under where."

243
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:57,777
(horn honking)

244
00:07:57,777 --> 00:07:59,679
Oh, that'll be
Frasier and Mia.

245
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:00,680
Yeah. I was
really surprised

246
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,682
he brought her here
for the weekend.

247
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:04,050
What's she like, anyway?

248
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,418
Uh, well...

249
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:06,919
she made quite an impression
on me.

250
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:09,422
I'm curious to see
what you'll think.

251
00:08:09,922 --> 00:08:10,823
Dad.

252
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:12,291
Would you hand me
that valise?

253
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:14,293
I want to put on
some bug repellent.

254
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:16,295
Oh, sure.
Ooh, it's kind of heavy.

255
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:17,663
What do you got in there?

256
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,465
Bug repellent.

257
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,512
(spraying continues)

258
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:37,583
Hello, Niles.

259
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:38,985
Hey, Frasier.

260
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:42,488
Honey, you stay out there
as long as you like!

261
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:44,423
She can't take her eyes
off that sunset.

262
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:45,858
Is everything
all set here?

263
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:46,859
Yes, I just want to make sure

264
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,861
this VCR works for our
little home movies later.
Right.

265
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,863
Check.
Splendid.

266
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:52,331
Ooh, Niles, you know what,
we're going to need

267
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:53,266
some more logs
from the woodpile.

268
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:54,634
Come give me a hand.

269
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:56,469
Uh, all right.

270
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:58,771
Oh, Fras! Isn't
it great to be back here?

271
00:08:58,771 --> 00:09:00,273
You know,
I want to thank you guys.

272
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:02,108
This is some gift.

273
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:03,476
You're
welcome, Dad.

274
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:04,944
Listen, if you're
enjoying this little trip

275
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:06,479
down memory lane, wait
till you see the other

276
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:07,480
blast from the past
we brought up here.

277
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,315
Shh, shh, shh.
Come on, come on.

278
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:12,151
Martin?

279
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:13,052
Hi.

280
00:09:14,787 --> 00:09:16,055
It's Mia.

281
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:17,924
Oh, my gosh, Frasier did
tell you I was coming,

282
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:18,758
didn't he?

283
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:21,661
Oh, yeah, yeah,
of course he did.

284
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:24,497
Yeah, well,
nice meeting you.

285
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:27,066
It's very nice
to meet you.

286
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:29,035
Well, it's
so beautiful here.

287
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:30,503
Well, I'm glad you like it.

288
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:31,370
Are you kidding?

289
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:32,638
I feel like I'm in heaven.

290
00:09:32,638 --> 00:09:36,509
I'm starting to feel
that way myself.

291
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:38,311
Well, nice going, Niles!

292
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:39,178
What happened?

293
00:09:39,178 --> 00:09:40,546
Niles dropped a huge log

294
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:41,881
right onto my hand

295
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:44,684
when he was startled
by a moth.

296
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:46,385
(laughs softly)

297
00:09:46,385 --> 00:09:47,320
It was not a moth.

298
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:48,821
It was a bat.

299
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:50,823
I could tell from that
eerie, high-pitched scream.

300
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:52,825
That was you!

301
00:09:52,825 --> 00:09:55,294
You know, frankly, I wish you'd
start seeing someone

302
00:09:55,294 --> 00:09:56,796
about this bug
phobia of yours.

303
00:09:56,796 --> 00:09:58,764
It is not a phobia.

304
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:01,767
I have a healthy fear
of our natural predators.

305
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,769
It's us versus them,
and frankly,

306
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:06,606
I'm starting to wonder
just whose side you're on.

307
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,541
It just amazes me that
a good psychiatrist

308
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,042
can be so blind to
something so obvious.

309
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:11,544
Oh, honey,
your poor thumb.

310
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:12,545
We should go put
something on that.

311
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:14,847
Well, okay.

312
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,151
God,

313
00:10:19,151 --> 00:10:21,887
she looks just like your mother.

314
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:23,556
I know, and Frasier
doesn't see it.

315
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:25,224
You're kidding.

316
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:26,492
No, and he has the gall
to tell me I'm blind.

317
00:10:26,492 --> 00:10:28,461
He's clearly the one dealing
with repressed material,

318
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,863
not to mention the obvious
oedipal issues.

319
00:10:30,863 --> 00:10:33,232
Argle gargle, google goo.

320
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:35,201
What?

321
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:36,202
Now you know how it feels.

322
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:37,703
What are you talking about?!

323
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:39,672
I'm talking about
Freud's theory

324
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:40,673
of the Oedipus complex.

325
00:10:41,173 --> 00:10:43,209
He believed that every man
subconsciously

326
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:46,145
wants to sleep with his mother
and kill his father.

327
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:48,014
It's modeled on the Greek
tragedy of Edipus,

328
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:50,516
who actually did sleep with his
mother and kill his father.

329
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:52,018
And when he realized
what he'd done,

330
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:53,486
he gouged out both his eyes.

331
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:56,789
Hmm. Probably not too tough
to pick that guy out of lineup.

332
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:00,660
Oh, why don't we just send out
engraved invitations

333
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,562
for all the bugs of the forest?

334
00:11:03,562 --> 00:11:05,364
But the question is,

335
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:07,166
how do we bring it
to Frasier's attention?

336
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,501
We don't.

337
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,770
Dad, denial of this magnitude
is not healthy.

338
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,538
It's for his
own good.
No, Niles.

339
00:11:12,538 --> 00:11:13,906
Okay, it's for my own good.

340
00:11:13,906 --> 00:11:15,408
Come on, after the way he wagged
his finger at me,

341
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:17,376
you can't expect I'm just gonna
be quiet about this.

342
00:11:17,376 --> 00:11:19,845
Look, the last thing I want
on my birthday weekend

343
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:21,347
is some big, long,
drawn-out argument

344
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,314
between you two, all right?

345
00:11:22,314 --> 00:11:24,383
Now, let's just
chill this beer

346
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:25,885
that we brought,
all right?

347
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:27,386
And just put all these
weird thoughts

348
00:11:27,386 --> 00:11:28,854
out of our minds.
Fine.

349
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:30,322
Oh, sorry, Dad.

350
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:34,827
Uh, come on, hon, let's go see
if our room still has that...

351
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:36,328
big, creaky, old pine bed

352
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:39,365
that Mom and Dad
used to sleep in.

353
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:40,800
Ah, yeah, there she is!

354
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:47,239
Well, I guess a warm one
wouldn't kill us.

355
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:53,479
(liquid pouring)

356
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:55,047
MARTIN:
Boy, being in this place

357
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:56,549
really takes me back.

358
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:57,483
Hey, remember
that summer

359
00:11:57,483 --> 00:11:59,952
I tried to teach you
boys how to fish?

360
00:11:59,952 --> 00:12:01,821
You just didn't
have the knack,

361
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:03,222
so I went out,

362
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:05,224
and I bought these two big trout

363
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,992
and snuck them on the boat.

364
00:12:06,992 --> 00:12:09,228
Oh, Marty,
you're terrible.
Oh, yeah.

365
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:11,597
And then I put the
trout on their hooks,

366
00:12:11,597 --> 00:12:13,299
and I dropped them
over the side,

367
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:17,103
while you two were still arguing
about the last Dramamine.

368
00:12:18,337 --> 00:12:20,506
I felt bad about
fooling you,

369
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:22,408
but, hell, what's the harm
of a little fantasy

370
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:23,876
if it makes you feel good?

371
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:27,079
More wine?
Oh, thanks, hon.

372
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:29,215
Frasier, you've
hardly touched

373
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:30,082
your chicken.

374
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:31,450
Is something wrong?

375
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:32,852
Oh, no, no.
It's just that...

376
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:34,854
well, I'm having a little
trouble holding the knife

377
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:37,256
because someone dropped a log
on my thumb.

378
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:39,191
Oh, it didn't hurt you
that badly.

379
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:40,126
You are such a baby.

380
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:41,560
You are a baby--
running and screaming

381
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:42,928
because of a little moth.

382
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:44,730
I told you that was a bat.
It was not a bat!

383
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:47,233
All right, boys,
that's enough!
Not at the table.

384
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:48,534
Your father's right.

385
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:50,302
Now, Frasier, if your
hand's hurting you,

386
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:51,704
I'll cut your meat for you.

387
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:53,606
Well, all right.

388
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:54,573
There.

389
00:12:54,573 --> 00:12:56,041
You know, Niles,
not to dwell on this,

390
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:58,043
but, you know, I could
give you the number

391
00:12:58,043 --> 00:12:59,512
of a man who specializes
in bug phobias.

392
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:01,380
Oh, is that so?
Frankly, while
you're at it,

393
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,248
I think
you should talk to him

394
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:03,749
about your compulsive
chair-dusting.

395
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:05,050
I believe that is related.

396
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:05,851
Frasier.

397
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:06,852
Well, I'm sorry, Dad.

398
00:13:06,852 --> 00:13:08,854
I think a good psychiatrist
should be self-aware.

399
00:13:08,854 --> 00:13:11,624
Open wide.

400
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:17,630
So, you're saying
I lack self-awareness?

401
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,598
Why don't we change the subject,
all right?

402
00:13:19,598 --> 00:13:20,599
This is a great meal, Mia.

403
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:22,101
Thank you.
It certainly was.

404
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:23,602
Frasier, when it comes
to girlfriends,

405
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:25,604
you've certainly struck
the mother lode.

406
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:26,605
Niles!

407
00:13:26,605 --> 00:13:28,874
FRASIER:
You haven't even

408
00:13:28,874 --> 00:13:30,142
read her books yet, Dad.

409
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:31,644
It's a delightful series

410
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:34,113
about an adventurous
little panda.

411
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:36,649
Sounds worthy
of Mother Goose.

412
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:37,583
Uh, so, uh...

413
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:39,885
what's coming up next
for you, Mia?

414
00:13:39,885 --> 00:13:41,687
Well, I'll have to swear you
to secrecy.
All right.

415
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:43,689
It looks like that panda

416
00:13:43,689 --> 00:13:46,158
might just find
its way into the attic.

417
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:47,893
Oh, yes, mum's the word.

418
00:13:47,893 --> 00:13:49,028
Oh, sorry, Niles.

419
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:51,463
Could you, uh, maybe
come into the kitchen,

420
00:13:51,463 --> 00:13:52,998
and I'll, uh,

421
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:55,000
I'll just, uh, help
you get dried off.

422
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,269
All right?
Yes, of course.

423
00:13:57,269 --> 00:14:00,472
Oh, dear, it looks like these
pants may have to be re-pressed.

424
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:02,408
What the hell's
the matter with you?

425
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:03,409
Oh, I am sorry, Dad.

426
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:04,376
You can't expect me

427
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:05,911
to let him sit there
in his booster seat

428
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:07,413
and tell me I lack
self-awareness.

429
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:09,381
He's going to pick up
on what you're saying.

430
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:11,116
You want the whole thing
to blow up?

431
00:14:11,116 --> 00:14:12,718
Dad, this level of
denial is unhealthy.

432
00:14:12,718 --> 00:14:13,586
We're not in denial!

433
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:14,587
Everything's perfect!

434
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:16,589
This is the best birthday
I've ever had!

435
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:18,591
Oh.

436
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:19,592
Oh, hi.

437
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:20,593
I'm sorry.

438
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:23,095
I know it's early,
but, um, I'm exhausted.

439
00:14:23,095 --> 00:14:24,096
Oh, Mia,
well, you go.

440
00:14:24,096 --> 00:14:26,098
You hit the sack.
Thanks for dinner.

441
00:14:26,098 --> 00:14:28,100
Delicious.
We'll wash
the dishes.

442
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,101
Thank you.

443
00:14:29,101 --> 00:14:30,102
I'll be along
in a minute.

444
00:14:30,102 --> 00:14:31,103
Um, Frasier...
Yes?

445
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:33,405
Before you turn in, there's
a little something

446
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:34,173
we need to deal with.

447
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:35,541
Oh, geez.

448
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:36,809
Oh, right, Dad,
your birthday gift.

449
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:38,277
Oh, yes, my gift!
It's my gift.

450
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:39,745
I want to open my gift,
all right?

451
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:42,748
It's my birthday
this weekend, right?

452
00:14:42,748 --> 00:14:45,751
Come on, Niles,
it'll be fun.

453
00:14:45,751 --> 00:14:46,719
Oh, yes, fine.

454
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:47,720
Oh, come on.

455
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,522
Seeing you and me,
Dad and Mom.

456
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:52,291
You know,
I'm getting more excited

457
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:53,259
by the second.

458
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:54,493
Yeah, come on.

459
00:14:54,493 --> 00:14:56,829
Oh, okay, Dad, now listen.

460
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:57,830
You sit right here,
all right?

461
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:58,831
Oh, okay.

462
00:14:58,831 --> 00:15:00,833
What is it,
some kind of movie?

463
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:01,834
Oh, that's right.

464
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:03,335
Here we go.

465
00:15:03,335 --> 00:15:05,104
All right.

466
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:08,807
MARTIN:
Oh, my old home movies.

467
00:15:08,807 --> 00:15:10,209
I haven't seen these
for 20 years.

468
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:11,744
FRASIER:
Well, happy birthday, Dad.

469
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,212
Now you can watch them
whenever you like.

470
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:14,580
MARTIN:
Oh!

471
00:15:15,814 --> 00:15:17,516
Isn't it just
the reaction

472
00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:18,918
you were hoping for?

473
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,819
One of them.

474
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:31,230
Oh, dear God.

475
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:35,868
Do you two see what I see?

476
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:37,336
My God, they could be twins.

477
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:38,771
Frasier,
take it easy.

478
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,239
Youdosee it.

479
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:41,740
How could you miss it?

480
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,075
How cloud I miss it?

481
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:44,376
Just, uh, you
calm him down,

482
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:45,811
and I'll go get him
a drink of water.
All right.

483
00:15:45,811 --> 00:15:47,379
Oh, my God.
Frasier, Frasier,
Frasier.

484
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:48,380
The important thing

485
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,848
is not to blow this
out of proportion.

486
00:15:49,848 --> 00:15:51,283
After all...

487
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:55,721
What was that,
a hummingbird?

488
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:57,556
(panting)

489
00:15:57,556 --> 00:15:59,692
What is the matter with me?

490
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:00,993
Frasier, you didn't
do anything wrong.

491
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:01,994
Your feelings for Mia

492
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:03,996
stem from perfectly
natural oedipal desires.

493
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:05,497
Yes, but oedipal desires

494
00:16:05,497 --> 00:16:08,000
are supposed to resolve
themselves by the age of six.

495
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,835
Oh, for God's sake,
give me that, you idiot.

496
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:11,503
(screams)

497
00:16:13,205 --> 00:16:15,474
I blinded myself.

498
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,910
I leave you alone with him
for two seconds...

499
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:18,877
No, no, no, Dad.

500
00:16:18,877 --> 00:16:19,912
Here, Frasier,
are you all right?

501
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:21,413
Oh, God.
Here, here, wipe your eyes.

502
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:22,915
(weeping):
I'll be all right.

503
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:23,916
Just let me, uh...
here...

504
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:26,819
Just let me try to calm down
a little bit.

505
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:29,688
She's... she's not my mother.

506
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:30,723
Frasier.
Hmm?

507
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:33,225
Time for bed.

508
00:16:36,228 --> 00:16:38,230
(door closes)

509
00:16:47,906 --> 00:16:50,309
Hello.

510
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:55,147
You wanted to see me?

511
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:57,616
I hope I wasn't rushing you.

512
00:16:57,616 --> 00:16:59,118
No, no.

513
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:01,553
It is bedtime.

514
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:02,454
Are you okay, sweetie?

515
00:17:02,454 --> 00:17:03,956
I mean, you seem a little tense.

516
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:05,290
No, no, no, no.

517
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:07,526
I just need to, uh,
calm down a little bit.

518
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:09,995
Here, just let me, uh--
here, ah, yeah...

519
00:17:09,995 --> 00:17:12,464
See, that's better.

520
00:17:12,464 --> 00:17:15,467
Honey, it seems
like you're in pain.

521
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:17,803
(gasps)
Oh, it's your hand.

522
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:19,705
Yes, yes, that's it, yeah.

523
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:22,708
Well, I know what
the problem is there.

524
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,210
I never kissed your
little boo-boo.

525
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,111
(gasps)

526
00:17:26,111 --> 00:17:27,513
We don't want these
other fingers

527
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:29,014
to be jealous, do we?

528
00:17:29,014 --> 00:17:30,282
(gasps)

529
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:31,517
I...

530
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:32,451
Oh, Frasier, honey.

531
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:35,387
Please, tell me
what's wrong.

532
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:37,389
What's bothering you?

533
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,392
I'm sorry, I-I don't know
what's wrong with me.

534
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:42,895
I'm just having a little trouble
getting comfortable.

535
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,396
Well, was it
something I did?

536
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:45,864
Something I said
at dinner? What?

537
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,836
Okay, okay.

538
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:54,306
Gosh, this is awkward.
Uh...

539
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:57,743
I've just realized

540
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:02,014
that you bear a striking
resemblance to my mother.

541
00:18:02,014 --> 00:18:03,782
But you just
noticed it now?

542
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:05,284
Yes.

543
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:06,285
Well, it can't be

544
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:08,120
that strong of a
resemblance, then,

545
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,322
can it?

546
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:11,690
That strong, huh?

547
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:15,694
Well, listen, I hope
you can get over it,

548
00:18:15,694 --> 00:18:18,697
because I think we
have a pretty great
thing going here.

549
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:19,665
Don't you?

550
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:22,634
Yes.

551
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:24,136
We have loads in common.

552
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:25,537
We get along great.
Mm-hmm.

553
00:18:25,537 --> 00:18:27,439
And don't you want to
stick around long enough

554
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:31,210
to see how that naughty panda
gets out of the attic?

555
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:34,379
Oh, I do, yes.

556
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:35,714
(chuckling):
God, you're right.

557
00:18:35,714 --> 00:18:37,216
You know,
just talking about this

558
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:38,217
makes me feel much better.

559
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:39,218
Good.

560
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:42,020
Oh, gosh,
you're not my mother.
No.

561
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,355
This is ridiculous.

562
00:18:43,355 --> 00:18:44,323
Mm-hmm.

563
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:46,091
So, you're okay?

564
00:18:46,091 --> 00:18:48,327
I'm okay.

565
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:52,731
(both moan)

566
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:54,933
I'm better than okay.

567
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:57,569
Okay, then.

568
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,648
(car horn honks)

569
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:12,751
Oh, well, there's
your cab.

570
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:16,021
Take care of yourself.
Yeah.

571
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:17,990
I'm sorry this is so awkward.

572
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,192
No, really, it's fine.

573
00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:21,460
Okay.
Okay.

574
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,961
Here we go.

575
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:26,965
Sorry.

576
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:28,901
(groans)

577
00:19:31,236 --> 00:19:33,005
I take it that
cab was for Mia.

578
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,373
Yeah.

579
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:37,743
You know, I tried to get
past it, but I just couldn't.

580
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:39,178
I'm sorry, son.

581
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,646
Yeah, me,
too, Frasier.

582
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:43,115
Well, I won't be getting
much sleep tonight.

583
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:44,116
Yeah, I'm up, too.

584
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:46,618
I won't be getting a
wink of sleep, either,

585
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:49,388
the way those crickets
are raging.

586
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:51,190
Niles...

587
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:54,693
why don't you get us all
a nice, big brandy.

588
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,195
Yeah.

589
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:59,498
Now, don't make too
much of this, Frasier.

590
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:02,568
So you picked a woman who looked
like your mother. So what?

591
00:20:02,568 --> 00:20:04,836
Like her would have been fine,
Dad.

592
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:07,339
I'm not talking
about a similar hairdo

593
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:08,840
or the same crooked smile.

594
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,742
I was dating a replicant.

595
00:20:10,742 --> 00:20:12,611
Now, Frasier, I know
you're going to go crazy

596
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:14,112
convincing yourself
that you've got

597
00:20:14,112 --> 00:20:15,614
some big complex,

598
00:20:15,614 --> 00:20:17,115
but couldn't it be
simpler than that?

599
00:20:17,115 --> 00:20:20,552
Maybe you just
miss your mother.

600
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:22,354
I know I do.

601
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:25,657
I do think about her a lot.

602
00:20:25,657 --> 00:20:27,593
We all do.
Yeah.

603
00:20:27,593 --> 00:20:29,595
Thanks, Niles.
You're welcome.

604
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:31,530
Thank you.
Mmm.

605
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:37,469
Hey, I think we've talked about
all this enough for one night.

606
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:38,971
So, this is still my birthday,

607
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:41,473
I want to watch the rest
of my movies.
Ooh.

608
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:42,975
That's a great idea, Dad.

609
00:20:45,477 --> 00:20:47,479
Check.
(chuckles)

610
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:55,254
NILES:
Well, there certainly

611
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,488
are a lot of
us fighting.

612
00:20:56,488 --> 00:20:57,789
(chuckles)

613
00:20:57,789 --> 00:20:58,790
You know, Dad,

614
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:00,792
I wish there were
more shots of you in it.

615
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:03,695
Oh, no, no.
I liked being the cameraman.

616
00:21:03,695 --> 00:21:06,098
I got to focus
on the things I liked.

617
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:09,368
(chuckling)

618
00:21:09,368 --> 00:21:10,969
