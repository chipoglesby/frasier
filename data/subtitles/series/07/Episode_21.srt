1
00:00:07,907 --> 00:00:11,911
I can't believe
how cold it is in here.

2
00:00:11,911 --> 00:00:13,913
Niles, the climate
control is on.

3
00:00:13,913 --> 00:00:15,415
It's perfectly
comfortable.

4
00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:16,416
Oh, really?

5
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:17,417
Touch your tongue
to the seat belt.

6
00:00:17,417 --> 00:00:18,918
I dare you.

7
00:00:18,918 --> 00:00:20,387
I'm starting to
regret I even asked
you to this exhibit.

8
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:21,755
I wanted to
invite Regan,

9
00:00:21,755 --> 00:00:24,724
but after the disaster I made
of our first date,

10
00:00:24,724 --> 00:00:26,593
I just felt too ashamed
to even ask.

11
00:00:26,593 --> 00:00:27,994
Well, you can't avoid her
forever.

12
00:00:27,994 --> 00:00:29,996
She's your neighbor.

13
00:00:29,996 --> 00:00:30,997
Ask her again.

14
00:00:30,997 --> 00:00:32,365
What's the worst thing
that could happen?

15
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:33,733
She'd ask me
to stop harassing her,

16
00:00:33,733 --> 00:00:35,735
which means I'd have to spend
the next six months

17
00:00:35,735 --> 00:00:37,737
riding in the service elevator
with Guillermo

18
00:00:37,737 --> 00:00:39,539
and his three-legged cat.

19
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:41,141
How is little Wobbles?

20
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:42,976
Fine.

21
00:00:42,976 --> 00:00:45,712
I see what you're
doing, Niles!

22
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:46,546
Listen, if you're so cold,

23
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:48,481
there is a scarf
in the glove compartment.

24
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:49,883
Oh, really? I thought
that's where you kept

25
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:51,885
the butter and the eggs.

26
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:53,887
Well, now it's
burning up in here!

27
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:55,889
Oh...
I'm just going to
take this thing off.

28
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,390
Are you insane?
No.

29
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,858
Well, at least wait
until we've stopped.

30
00:00:58,858 --> 00:00:59,759
You're going
to get us killed!

31
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:00,994
Take the wheel.

32
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:02,862
I'll take the wheel, but...
Frasier, stop.

33
00:01:02,862 --> 00:01:04,264
No. It's almost off.

34
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:06,533
No, I mean brake! Brake!

35
00:01:10,937 --> 00:01:12,405
Are you all right?

36
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:13,907
Yes.

37
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:16,910
Thank heaven your
fist softened

38
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,412
the blow of
the airbag.

39
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,752
Hurt your nose?

40
00:01:28,154 --> 00:01:29,689
Yes.

41
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:30,957
That's what I figured.

42
00:01:30,957 --> 00:01:32,325
Right when you
came in, I said,

43
00:01:32,325 --> 00:01:34,594
"That guy hurt
his nose."

44
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:37,630
So how did you,
uh, you know...?

45
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:39,199
Excuse me.

46
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,703
Yes, hello, this is, uh,
Dr. Frasier Crane here.

47
00:01:43,703 --> 00:01:45,205
I was just wondering...

48
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:47,540
I filled out my paperwork
about half an hour ago.

49
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:48,341
They'll call you.

50
00:01:48,341 --> 00:01:50,210
We're seeing people
in order of importance.

51
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:53,413
Oh, really? Well, you know,
I do have my own radio show.

52
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:56,082
The importance of the injury.

53
00:01:56,082 --> 00:01:57,484
Yes, of course.

54
00:01:58,017 --> 00:02:00,954
Do you know-- are there
any plastic surgeons on call?

55
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,455
Oh, Niles, that's not necessary.

56
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:03,323
You can't be
too careful.

57
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:04,324
It could be broken.

58
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:05,859
Don't worry-- the best
plastic surgeons in town

59
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:07,660
have their offices here:
Dr. Rabb,

60
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,028
Dr. Karnofsky
and Dr. Burke.

61
00:02:09,028 --> 00:02:11,965
Karnofsky? Mel Karnofsky?

62
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:13,233
That's right.

63
00:02:15,101 --> 00:02:16,603
Maris' plastic surgeon.

64
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:19,139
Oh.

65
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,573
Would you believe
that charlatan

66
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:23,076
is still picking my pocket
a year after my divorce?

67
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:24,043
Good Lord, for what?

68
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:26,579
Oh, for Maris'
Botox injections.

69
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:28,314
You know, they use

70
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:31,084
those botulinum toxins
and put it in the forehead,

71
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:33,086
and it deadens the muscles
and takes away the wrinkles.

72
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:35,054
I gave it to her as a gift
one year for our anniversary.

73
00:02:35,054 --> 00:02:36,489
Oh, yes, probably
your tenth.

74
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:39,926
That's toxins,
isn't it?

75
00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:42,328
Anyway, Karnofsky
keeps billing me

76
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:43,763
for her follow-up
injections.

77
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:46,699
Good Lord.
So, you're
divorced, huh?

78
00:02:49,702 --> 00:02:50,703
Yes.

79
00:02:50,703 --> 00:02:52,572
Me, too. I'm Phil.
Hello.

80
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:54,474
14 years together.

81
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:55,975
Came home one day and...

82
00:02:55,975 --> 00:02:58,244
Oh, hell, I probably shouldn't
even talk about it.

83
00:02:58,244 --> 00:03:00,013
Okay.

84
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:03,516
You know, Niles,

85
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:04,484
seeing as how
we're here,

86
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:06,019
why don't you go
find this Karnofsky

87
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,287
and straighten the
whole thing out?

88
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:08,955
No, no, I can't
leave you here injured.

89
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:10,757
That's all right,
Niles, I'll be fine.

90
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:12,158
If you're sure...

91
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:14,427
I may just pay
Dr. Karnofsky a visit.

92
00:03:14,427 --> 00:03:15,228
You know, it really
is outrageous

93
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:16,696
what these scalpel
jockeys get away with--

94
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:17,730
convincing women
like Maris

95
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:19,232
to spend fortunes
on their exterior

96
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:20,233
when frankly,
what they need

97
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:22,001
is to take a good look
at the woman inside.

98
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:23,836
Right. Well, she did have
one chemical peel

99
00:03:23,836 --> 00:03:26,306
where you could see
her kidneys for a while.

100
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:28,208
That's very funny.
Off you go.

101
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,243
Good luck, Niles.
Thank you.

102
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:31,644
(sighing)

103
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:45,058
Not a pretty woman,

104
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,227
my wife, but
when she danced,

105
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,995
you couldn't keep
your eyes off her.

106
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:50,797
You know, actually,
I'm feeling a lot better.

107
00:03:50,797 --> 00:03:53,066
Good-bye.

108
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:56,169
Frasier Crane.

109
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:57,870
Frasier Crane,
we're ready to see you.

110
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:00,173
That's me.

111
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:10,350
Ah, Dr. Karnofsky,

112
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:11,417
I see you've
finally decided

113
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:12,285
to make time for me.

114
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:13,152
Sorry. I'm from Records.

115
00:04:13,152 --> 00:04:15,455
I was told to bring over
Maris Crane's files.

116
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:18,791
That's this year.

117
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,030
Dr. Crane?
NILES:
Yes.

118
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:26,499
I'm so sorry
to keep you waiting.

119
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:27,934
Melinda Karnofsky.

120
00:04:29,902 --> 00:04:32,405
Oh, uh... yes, of course.
Niles Crane.

121
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:33,339
Uh...

122
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:34,274
about this
billing issue...

123
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,541
(clears throat)

124
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:37,577
Oh. Oh, my God,
this box is filthy.

125
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:40,213
Uh, yes. The problem is

126
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:41,881
I have received

127
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:44,784
three invoices
over the past six months.

128
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,786
Yes. I'm so sorry
about that, and I...

129
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,755
I'm... so
sorry about...

130
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:50,056
(coughing):
all this dust.

131
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:50,857
Do you mind?

132
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:52,625
I'll have to turn
on my hepa filter.

133
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,360
Oh... you have
a hepa...

134
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,795
(gasping):
You have a Svenson!

135
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,797
Yes!

136
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:59,299
They're great,
aren't they?

137
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,767
Not to mention

138
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:02,735
impossible to get
in this country.

139
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:04,103
I've tried!

140
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:06,172
Well, I once did a favor
for Mrs. Svenson.

141
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:07,440
Oh, it's a
long story.

142
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,275
I'm all ears.

143
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:10,410
So was she.

144
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:11,944
Anyway,

145
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:13,313
I've spoken
to the accounting department

146
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:16,316
about your bill,
and it was clearly our mistake.

147
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,184
Please accept my apology.

148
00:05:18,184 --> 00:05:19,085
We'll take care of it.

149
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:21,054
Oh. I-I appreciate that.

150
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:22,522
Bye-bye.

151
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:23,523
Thank you. Oh...

152
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:26,459
Ooh, I like that print
very much.

153
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:27,360
Hmm?

154
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,661
Everything all right?

155
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:31,364
I'm sorry. I just noticed
a smudge on my jacket.

156
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:33,599
Well, it's barely noticeable.

157
00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:34,867
You're being kind.

158
00:05:34,867 --> 00:05:36,169
I got that print

159
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,904
at the last museum show.

160
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:40,206
Oh! I thought
you looked familiar.

161
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:42,008
Uh, perhaps I've seen you there.

162
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:42,742
Oh, perhaps.

163
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:44,210
I go to all of the openings.

164
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:46,112
I'm-I'm on the museum board.

165
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:48,314
Really?

166
00:05:48,314 --> 00:05:49,115
Well, congratulations.

167
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:50,483
All the exhibits
this year have been...

168
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:51,317
(sighing)

169
00:05:51,317 --> 00:05:53,152
...perfection.

170
00:05:53,152 --> 00:05:55,288
Thank you.

171
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:57,090
I, uh...

172
00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:00,059
I-I particularly like
the Picasso.

173
00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:01,994
I'm a big fan
of his-his cubist period.

174
00:06:01,994 --> 00:06:03,396
Oh, striking,
isn't she?

175
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:05,798
Yes, I'd like to think
if she'd come in here,

176
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:08,067
I could actually have
helped her.

177
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:12,038
You must think
I'm terribly fussy.

178
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:15,007
(wistfully):
Yes.

179
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:17,844
Well, anyway, it was
very nice meeting you.

180
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:18,578
Oh, likewise.

181
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:19,946
(intercom buzzes)

182
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:20,913
WOMAN (over intercom):
Dr. Karnofsky,

183
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:22,448
Mrs. Maggarshack
has a question for you

184
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:23,950
in room three.

185
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,418
Helen Maggarshack?

186
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:27,820
Oh, I really
can't say.

187
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,556
Oh, right.
She's finally having it removed?

188
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,158
Why did she wait?

189
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:33,359
I don't know.

190
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,667
I found '98.

191
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:44,537
Uh, actually, that's
all been settled.

192
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:45,338
Uh, can you tell me...

193
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:48,207
do you know, is...
is that her husband?

194
00:06:48,207 --> 00:06:50,410
No. She's divorced.
That's her son.

195
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,678
Really?

196
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:54,247
Dr. Karnofsky's so young,

197
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:57,049
she must have had him
when she was a child.

198
00:06:57,049 --> 00:06:58,818
Okay.

199
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:06,225
Oh! Oh, is there... is
there something else?

200
00:07:06,225 --> 00:07:08,161
Uh... no.

201
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:09,061
All right.

202
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:11,397
Uh, no.

203
00:07:11,397 --> 00:07:14,000
Well...
MEL:
Yes?

204
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,768
Mel, uh,
I was wondering, uh...

205
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:16,769
Ooh.
Oh.

206
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:17,770
(chuckling)

207
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:21,073
Uh, I, uh, uh...
This is a little awkward...

208
00:07:21,073 --> 00:07:22,842
Oh, thank you. I, uh, uh...

209
00:07:22,842 --> 00:07:25,711
I'm not really sure
how to ask... Uh...

210
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:26,579
I think I know what it is.

211
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:27,580
Uh-huh?

212
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,482
And you've got no reason
to be nervous.

213
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:30,416
Oh, really?
Yes.

214
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:31,918
Just a few quick
injections,

215
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:34,253
and those nasty
little wrinkles
in your forehead,

216
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:35,955
they'll disappear.

217
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:38,057
Well, that is

218
00:07:38,057 --> 00:07:39,625
what you were going to ask,
isn't it?

219
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,928
(laughing):
Yes.

220
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:44,297
Well, it's a very
simple procedure,

221
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:46,165
although your
forehead will be
numb for a while.

222
00:07:46,165 --> 00:07:48,167
I can fit you
in at, uh, 4:30.

223
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:49,135
Oh, good.

224
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:50,670
That gives me time
to do something I need to do.

225
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:51,671
Excellent.

226
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,477
(doorbell rings)

227
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,045
DAPHNE:
Hello, Dr. Crane.

228
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:00,046
NILES:
Hello, Daphne.

229
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:00,980
I was on my way home.

230
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,849
I thought I'd see
how the patient was doing.

231
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:04,584
Oh, I'm fine, thank you, Niles.

232
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:06,452
You have no idea
how guilty I'm feeling.

233
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:07,954
I suppose he told
you it was my fist

234
00:08:08,454 --> 00:08:10,790
that struck the
inadvertent yet
powerful blow.

235
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:15,628
So, how did things go

236
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:17,630
with the nefarious
Dr. Karnofsky?

237
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:18,998
Did you give him
a piece of your mind?

238
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:21,367
Actually,
"he" turned out to be a "she,"

239
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:23,636
and quite a reasonable "she"
at that.

240
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:25,371
Really? That's
quite a turnabout.

241
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:27,206
Yes, well...

242
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:28,975
Dr. Crane,
don't move.
Why?

243
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:29,809
There's a mosquito.

244
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:31,577
Where?
On your forehead.

245
00:08:31,577 --> 00:08:34,380
Oh, get off,
get off, get off.

246
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,715
It's already gone.
Oh.

247
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:37,717
Oh, dear, it looks
like it bit you.

248
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:41,053
Oh, right. Ow!

249
00:08:43,956 --> 00:08:48,227
Niles, wrinkle your forehead
for me, will you?

250
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:55,568
Why would I do that?

251
00:08:55,568 --> 00:08:58,204
Just do it.
Wrinkle your forehead.

252
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:04,277
I'm not
your marionette!

253
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:06,579
You got
a Botox injection!

254
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:08,748
You've got a forehead full
of poison right now, don't you?

255
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:11,484
I do not!

256
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:14,754
Oh, that's strange.

257
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:18,224
The mosquito fell right
out of the air dead.

258
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:22,862
What's a Botox
injection?

259
00:09:22,862 --> 00:09:24,864
Oh, it's a cosmetic
procedure they use

260
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:26,666
to eliminate
facial wrinkles.

261
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:27,934
Oh, great, my kids are having
plastic surgery.

262
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:30,303
That's a nice age to get to.

263
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:32,171
I can't believe
you let Maris' witch doctor

264
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:33,472
work her magic on you.

265
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:36,742
Mel... is a perfectly
lovely person.

266
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:38,244
In fact, I was screwing up
my courage

267
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,246
to ask her out on a date
when she noticed

268
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,582
this little flaw,
and I lost my nerve.

269
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:46,352
Yes... and most of the feeling
in your face, as well.

270
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:49,221
Dr. Crane, look.
Your picture's on the news.

271
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:50,089
Turn it up, Dad,
turn it up.

272
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,091
After checking
into the hospital

273
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:53,593
with what appeared to be
minor injuries

274
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:54,594
from a fender bender,

275
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:58,030
radio psychiatrist Frasier Crane
died suddenly today.

276
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:01,867
I'm sure I speak
for all of us here at KYOL

277
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:04,337
when I say
he will be sorely missed.

278
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:07,106
But this rain won't be missed,
will it, Flip?!

279
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,175
Dear God!

280
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:11,277
What the hell?
That's unbelievable!

281
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,613
Outrageous!

282
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:19,485
As it turns out,
after I left the hospital,

283
00:10:19,485 --> 00:10:21,887
some poor devil used
my name to jump the line

284
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:24,290
and he dropped dead
of a heart attack.

285
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,324
Oh.

286
00:10:25,324 --> 00:10:26,792
I must say, it does feel
a bit strange

287
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:29,261
having plunged
all of Seattle--

288
00:10:29,261 --> 00:10:33,766
albeit temporarily--
into so much grief.

289
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:35,201
I know I'll never forget
where I was

290
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:38,638
when I heard you had died.

291
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,806
I was out on
the street,

292
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:43,109
and there was this crowd
watching a television

293
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:44,610
through a department
store window...
Mm-hmm.

294
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:47,113
and before I knew
it, we were weeping

295
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:48,914
and hugging
each other...
That's very amusing, Roz.

296
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:51,717
And then it began to rain,

297
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:55,087
and I had this feeling
that all the angels were crying.

298
00:10:55,087 --> 00:10:56,389
Yes, all right, Roz!

299
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:57,890
Hey, Roz.

300
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:58,891
Fras, did
you see this?

301
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:00,393
Yes, as a matter
of fact, I did.

302
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:01,394
It's my obituary.

303
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:02,361
They printed it?

304
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:04,363
Yes, they must have picked it up
off the wire last night

305
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:05,865
before the news ran
that correction.

306
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:07,233
MARTIN:
Jimmy gave it to
me at McGinty's.

307
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:08,634
Boy, everybody
was so nice to me,

308
00:11:08,634 --> 00:11:11,404
buying me beers
and everything,

309
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:12,204
you know, because of the shock
I went through,

310
00:11:12,204 --> 00:11:15,007
thinking I'd lost my son.

311
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:16,308
Dad, what are you talking about?

312
00:11:16,308 --> 00:11:17,243
You never thought I was dead.

313
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:19,679
Well, people don't have
to know that.

314
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,380
I mean, I could
have been at home

315
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,282
alone wondering where you were,

316
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:25,718
and I get this
strange, uneasy feeling,

317
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:28,788
so I turn on the TV,
and there it is...

318
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:32,725
on the screen:
the face of my dead son.

319
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:34,694
I was sitting
right beside you!

320
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,128
Well, what the hell
kind of story is that?
It's the truth!

321
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:39,398
Well, the truth doesn't put
anything on a coaster.

322
00:11:39,398 --> 00:11:41,300
Well, that's something
for your scrapbook, huh?

323
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,802
Your own obituary.

324
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:44,670
Yes, well...

325
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:48,941
you know, frankly, it's...
it's a little upsetting.

326
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:50,810
I don't think they meant
to be insulting.

327
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:52,645
You are"lovably pompous."

328
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:54,513
Well, no, it's not that.

329
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:57,016
Not that. It's just,
you know, seeing my life

330
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:58,017
in black and white.

331
00:11:58,017 --> 00:12:02,354
It just all looks
a little... incomplete.

332
00:12:02,354 --> 00:12:03,155
What do you mean?

333
00:12:03,155 --> 00:12:05,424
Well, I was going to do
so much with my life.

334
00:12:05,424 --> 00:12:09,228
I was going to write a novel
and run for public office.

335
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:12,631
I was going to do
my own translation of Freud.

336
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:15,935
Well, what's stopping you?
You're not actually dead.

337
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:18,304
I guess
you're right, Roz.

338
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:20,706
I'm not dead, am I?

339
00:12:20,706 --> 00:12:21,607
You know,
maybe that's a good way

340
00:12:21,607 --> 00:12:22,608
of looking at this, actually.

341
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:24,577
More of a-a wake-up call.

342
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:27,546
Dr. Crane, I
was so relieved

343
00:12:27,546 --> 00:12:29,415
to hear that you
were all right.

344
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,083
Oh, thank you.
I heard the news

345
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,885
and I thought, "What a shame.

346
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:35,154
Why, he is such a young man."

347
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:36,355
That's so nice of you.
Thank you.

348
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:37,723
Thank you so much.

349
00:12:37,723 --> 00:12:38,691
God, you know,
you're right.

350
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:40,693
What am I doing
frittering away my day here

351
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:41,694
in this coffee house?

352
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:42,695
You know what?
I've got things to do.

353
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:44,697
I've got fresh worlds
to conquer.

354
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:47,199
I'm going to go out there
and grab life by the scruff.

355
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:49,201
Look out, destiny, here I come.

356
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:50,569
(thunder rumbling)

357
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:55,407
Oh, well, it's
really coming down out there.

358
00:12:58,644 --> 00:12:59,912
DAPHNE:
What happened
to your clothes?

359
00:12:59,912 --> 00:13:01,680
Did you spill something
on yourself?

360
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,382
Oh, no, no.
I'm-I'm going jogging later.

361
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:05,217
No need to be sarcastic.

362
00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:07,720
Just give me the clothes,
and I'll do another load.

363
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,654
No, I'm serious, Daphne.

364
00:13:08,654 --> 00:13:09,722
I plan to go running

365
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:11,590
just after I finish
my obituary.

366
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,859
You see,

367
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:15,194
it's a self-actualizing
exercise.

368
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:18,430
You see, you write your obituary
the way you'd like it to appear

369
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:19,265
years from now,
of course,

370
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:21,767
and then it helps you
to focus your goals.

371
00:13:21,767 --> 00:13:24,770
You see, here they are--
all my hopes and dreams.

372
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:26,272
These are dreams,
all right.

373
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:28,774
(laughs)

374
00:13:28,774 --> 00:13:31,277
"Dr. Crane came
late to athletics.

375
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:33,779
"He became a fixture
in the Seattle marathon,

376
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:35,748
"the America's
Cup Yacht Race

377
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:37,550
as well as the
Kentucky Derby."

378
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:39,685
(laughing)

379
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:41,053
A jockey at your size?

380
00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:45,024
You better start
writing an obituary
for the horse.

381
00:13:45,024 --> 00:13:46,559
Very amusing, Daphne.

382
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:48,527
I meant as a stable owner.

383
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:49,962
Hey, Fras,
what'd you do,

384
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:51,397
spill something
on your clothes?

385
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:53,365
No, no, I'm going jogging later.

386
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:55,768
Well, there's no need
to get sarcastic about it.

387
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:57,736
I'm serious, Dad.

388
00:13:57,736 --> 00:13:58,737
I mean, I have
to start somewhere

389
00:13:58,737 --> 00:14:00,072
if I plan to run
a marathon.

390
00:14:00,072 --> 00:14:01,907
Oh! We got a new basket?

391
00:14:01,907 --> 00:14:04,743
Hickory Farms.

392
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:06,579
Yeah, that one came
this afternoon.

393
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:07,546
Dad, we agreed
we were going to send back

394
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:09,515
all the condolence baskets
intact.

395
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:10,950
Yeah, I know, I know...

396
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:12,952
but, you know,
if a can of pecans falls out

397
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:14,954
here and there,
who's going to notice?

398
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:17,423
Oh, by the way,
guess who I ran into?

399
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:19,658
That friend of yours
from next door, Regan.

400
00:14:19,658 --> 00:14:21,794
Really?
MARTIN:
Yeah.

401
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:23,128
You know, she was
pretty relieved

402
00:14:23,128 --> 00:14:24,129
to hear you weren't dead.

403
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:26,498
I don't know, maybe there's
still something going on there.

404
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:27,299
Oh, I don't know, Dad.

405
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:28,300
I'd like to believe that,

406
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,302
but I'm just too much
of a realist.

407
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:32,738
(doorbell rings)
Tell that to the two
million people a year

408
00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:34,707
who visit
Frasierland.

409
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,742
(laughs)

410
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:39,044
FRASIER:
It's a Web site.

411
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:41,247
It teaches children
about psychiatry.

412
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:43,515
Hey, Dad, I can't stay.

413
00:14:43,515 --> 00:14:44,516
I just realized

414
00:14:44,516 --> 00:14:46,485
I think I left my cell phone
here last night.

415
00:14:46,485 --> 00:14:48,020
Oh, yeah, I did
see it somewhere.

416
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:48,988
Let's have a look.

417
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:51,390
Hey, why are you
wearing running clothes?

418
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,893
He won't tell us.

419
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,427
DAPHNE:
Oh, here it is.

420
00:14:55,427 --> 00:14:57,830
It was buried back here
underneath all these baskets.

421
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,698
Oh, Daph, look what you did!

422
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:01,700
Rooting around in there,
you poked a hole

423
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:05,571
right through this
Hickory Farms basket!

424
00:15:07,706 --> 00:15:09,041
We can't send it back now.

425
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:11,277
Thank you, Daphne.

426
00:15:11,277 --> 00:15:12,278
FRASIER:
Niles?

427
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:13,579
Yeah.

428
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,281
Is that a bandage
sticking out of your shirt?

429
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:16,615
Oh, where?

430
00:15:16,615 --> 00:15:17,516
Well, right there.

431
00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:18,450
Oh, yes.

432
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:19,818
I-I cut myself shaving.

433
00:15:19,818 --> 00:15:23,255
What, on the back of your neck?

434
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:26,258
You went to see Karnofsky again,
didn't you?

435
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:27,726
Yes, I did.

436
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:29,228
I... I was going
to ask her out again,

437
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:32,164
but I-I got all flustered
when I... I caught her staring

438
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:34,099
at this grotesque carbuncle.

439
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:35,968
Carbuncle? You
mean that minuscule
mole of yours?

440
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:36,969
Well, to you.

441
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:38,804
I-I've always been
self-conscious about it.

442
00:15:38,804 --> 00:15:40,673
I've made many
a hasty wine selection

443
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:43,475
because I felt the sommelier
staring down...

444
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:44,777
Oh, Niles, please.

445
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:45,778
Why don't you just
knock this off?

446
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:48,047
Isn't it time you just
asked the woman out?

447
00:15:48,047 --> 00:15:51,183
Frasier, I-I'm-I'm just waiting
until the moment's right.

448
00:15:51,183 --> 00:15:52,351
Like you did with Daphne?

449
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:55,187
Oh, Niles,
I am sorry.

450
00:15:55,187 --> 00:15:56,055
It's just that...

451
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:57,389
I'd like to see you do this

452
00:15:57,389 --> 00:15:59,725
while I can still pick you
out of a crowd.

453
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:03,329
You know, I've
got tickets

454
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:04,129
for the opera tonight.

455
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,464
Why don't you ask her
to join you?

456
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:06,799
Oh, I don't know.

457
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:07,833
FRASIER:
Oh, come on.

458
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,335
Take a cue from me.

459
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:11,303
I am completely
reinventing myself.

460
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:12,838
You know what--
if I can learn a new language

461
00:16:12,838 --> 00:16:16,842
and-and climb mountains
and write a best-seller,

462
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:18,344
well, then surely you can ask
this woman out.

463
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:19,345
Now, if you'll excuse me,

464
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:20,813
I have a marathon
to train for.

465
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,314
Oh!

466
00:16:23,248 --> 00:16:25,751
Are you all
right, Fras?

467
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:27,753
FRASIER:
I'm fine.

468
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:28,754
Wh-what happened?

469
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:30,756
Well, I think he tripped
on one of these baskets.

470
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:31,757
Well, did you
break anything?

471
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:33,258
FRASIER:
I don't think so.

472
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:34,760
Because, you know,
if you broke it,

473
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:38,263
there's no point
in sending this
one back, either.

474
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:54,413
Oh, dear God.

475
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:57,649
(chuckling):
Hey, look at you.

476
00:16:57,649 --> 00:16:58,984
Oh, they gave you a sweet one.

477
00:16:58,984 --> 00:17:01,487
All shiny,
no scuffs.

478
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:05,824
Still has
that new cane smell.

479
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:07,092
If you play
your cards right,

480
00:17:07,092 --> 00:17:08,594
I might let you take
it for a spin around the lobby,

481
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:10,396
all right?

482
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:11,730
So, what'd they say?

483
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:12,731
Oh, just a little sprain.

484
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:14,733
It's going to take
a couple of weeks.

485
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:16,235
You know, I guess I'm going
to have to rethink

486
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:18,537
my life's plan a bit.

487
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,739
Oh, you're going to be doing
all this stuff?

488
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:23,042
Well, of course, Dad.
Why wouldn't I?

489
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:26,245
Oh, I don't know, it just seems
all so complicated.

490
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:28,113
The first one you tried
was kind of a bust.

491
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:30,082
Yes, all right.
Well, you know what?

492
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:33,619
I've just got to scale
things back a little bit,

493
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:36,922
set my sights
on more attainable goals.

494
00:17:36,922 --> 00:17:38,624
Well, for instance,
here.

495
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:40,993
"Visit South America."

496
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:43,028
That's in.

497
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:46,465
"Discover the lost treasure
of the Incas."

498
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:51,170
That's out.

499
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:53,672
"Take up rafting."

500
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:55,174
That's in.

501
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:58,444
"Retrace Lewis
and Clark's route."

502
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:01,280
That's out.

503
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,782
And this
perpetual motion stuff--

504
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:05,751
all this can go.

505
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,719
(doorbell rings)

506
00:18:07,719 --> 00:18:09,221
Daphne!

507
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:10,722
Oh, no, she's out
for the whole evening.

508
00:18:10,722 --> 00:18:12,024
You're going to have
to get it yourself.

509
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:13,392
Oh, all right.

510
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:14,393
Come on, let's see

511
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:16,395
how that thing
handles the corners.

512
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:18,864
Come on,
open her up!

513
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:21,100
(laughing)

514
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,401
Oh...
Oh!

515
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:25,404
Frasier, I'd like you to meet
Dr. Mel Karnofsky.

516
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:26,905
Well, I can't
tell you what a
pleasure this is.

517
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:28,173
Hello.

518
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:28,974
NILES:
I believe you have

519
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:29,975
some opera tickets
for us?

520
00:18:29,975 --> 00:18:31,477
FRASIER:
Yes, I do.

521
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:33,479
Oh, uh, Mel, this is
my father, Martin.

522
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:34,313
MEL:
Oh, hello.

523
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:35,547
Hi. How are you?
FRASIER:
Here we are.

524
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:37,483
Oh, thank you.
We're very grateful for this.

525
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:40,486
Niles and I happen to be
such huge fans of Puccini.

526
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:41,987
Speaking
of which,

527
00:18:41,987 --> 00:18:43,489
here's our own
little pooch-ini.

528
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:45,891
Oh, well!
Oh, well!

529
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:48,293
You're a darling! Yes!

530
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,295
Oh, he's wonderful.

531
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:51,296
Yes.

532
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,132
Oh...

533
00:18:55,934 --> 00:18:57,936
So, where are you
two having dinner?

534
00:18:57,936 --> 00:18:58,937
Bel Canto.

535
00:18:58,937 --> 00:19:00,439
We have a table
on the terrace.

536
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:01,807
The terrace?

537
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:04,109
Well, I didn't know
they had a terrace.

538
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:06,044
Really? Oh, well, I guess
you have to know the owner.

539
00:19:06,044 --> 00:19:07,813
But we'd better be going.

540
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,548
I've pre-ordered
our chocolate souffleï¿©s,

541
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:11,483
and they'll be ready
at 7:30 precisely.

542
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:12,985
FRASIER:
Well, off
you go, then.

543
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,453
Just remember, Niles,

544
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:15,954
nothing puts
on love handles

545
00:19:15,954 --> 00:19:17,956
faster than
chocolate souffle.

546
00:19:17,956 --> 00:19:18,957
Oh, well, you know,

547
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:21,994
no one takes them off
faster than I do.

548
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:24,997
That's... that's very funny.

549
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,499
Lovely meeting you.

550
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:31,470
Well, she seems a bit much.

551
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,905
What do you mean?

552
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:34,406
Well, you know,
picking the restaurant,

553
00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:35,908
dining on the terrace.

554
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:37,910
"You have to know the owner."

555
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:39,845
Doesn't she remind you
of someone?

556
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:42,648
Yeah. You.

557
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,018
I was talking about Maris.

558
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:46,885
MARTIN:
Oh, come on.

559
00:19:46,885 --> 00:19:48,253
Don't you think
you're overreacting

560
00:19:48,253 --> 00:19:49,254
a little bit?

561
00:19:49,254 --> 00:19:50,756
I mean, Niles
sure seems happy.

562
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:52,257
Oh, I guess
you're right, Dad.

563
00:19:52,257 --> 00:19:54,159
Besides, I've got a lot

564
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:55,093
to accomplish
this evening.

565
00:19:55,093 --> 00:19:57,095
I'm going to start
on my Russian language tapes.

566
00:19:57,095 --> 00:19:59,031
(chuckles)

567
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,799
What? What is it, Dad?

568
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,367
What? Nothing.

569
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:04,903
What? Don't you think
I can do any of these things?

570
00:20:04,903 --> 00:20:07,206
No, I think you can do anything
you put your mind to, Frasier.

571
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,640
You always have.

572
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,142
Thank you, Dad.

573
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:12,644
I just wonder about
all these projects.

574
00:20:12,644 --> 00:20:15,647
Well, as I said,
I am streamlining.

575
00:20:15,647 --> 00:20:17,649
You know, I think
what you discovered this week

576
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:19,918
was that something's missing
from your life,

577
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:21,787
and before you
start to fill it up

578
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:22,654
with everything but
the kitchen sink,

579
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:25,557
I thought you ought
to just ask yourself,

580
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:27,559
"What do I really want?

581
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:32,831
What is really going to make
me happy... now?"

582
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:39,171
Well, that's weird.

583
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:42,040
I suddenly feel
like having a beer.

584
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:22,014
Regan, it's me, Frasier.
