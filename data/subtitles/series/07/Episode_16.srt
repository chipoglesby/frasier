1
00:00:08,074 --> 00:00:10,010
(phone ringing)

2
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:15,582
(Frasier mumbles)

3
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:22,689
Hello?

4
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:23,623
MAN:
Dr. Crane?

5
00:00:23,623 --> 00:00:24,491
Yes. Who's this?

6
00:00:24,491 --> 00:00:26,559
Dr. Kaufman.

7
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:29,596
Bob Kaufman of the National
Psychotherapy Institute.

8
00:00:29,596 --> 00:00:32,866
Oh, my gosh, it's 6:15
in the morning your time.

9
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:34,734
I hope I didn't wake you.

10
00:00:34,734 --> 00:00:36,136
No, no, no, I was up.

11
00:00:36,136 --> 00:00:37,637
Uh...

12
00:00:37,637 --> 00:00:40,407
Where did you say
you're calling from?

13
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:42,675
The National
Psychotherapy
Institute

14
00:00:42,675 --> 00:00:44,177
in Saddle River,
New Jersey?

15
00:00:44,177 --> 00:00:46,513
Oh, yes, of course.

16
00:00:46,513 --> 00:00:48,848
Uh... what can I do for you?

17
00:00:48,848 --> 00:00:52,218
Oh, for Pete's sake,
no one called you?

18
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:55,522
You've won our Radio Therapist
of the Year Award.

19
00:00:55,522 --> 00:00:56,923
Congratulations.

20
00:00:59,926 --> 00:01:00,927
Well, thank you.

21
00:01:00,927 --> 00:01:04,397
Uh... of course,
the work itself is honor enough.

22
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:06,366
Thank you,
and I'm sorry about the mix-up.

23
00:01:06,366 --> 00:01:09,369
Problem is, we're going
to need some pictures of you

24
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:11,204
so we can get started
on the statue.

25
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:14,507
"Statue"?

26
00:01:14,507 --> 00:01:16,443
For our Hall of Thinkers?

27
00:01:16,443 --> 00:01:21,014
Angie, he never got the packet.

28
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:23,016
Uh, is there anything I can do?

29
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:24,951
Well, it's a little late now

30
00:01:24,951 --> 00:01:27,387
but, uh, maybe if you
described your body

31
00:01:27,387 --> 00:01:29,889
we could get started on
the preliminary carving.

32
00:01:29,889 --> 00:01:31,391
The sculptor's
right here.

33
00:01:31,391 --> 00:01:33,760
Fortunately, we got
the Gustav Brumholt.

34
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,629
Oh, my.

35
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:39,132
(German accent):
Ja, ja,Dr. Crane, please,ja?

36
00:01:39,132 --> 00:01:40,533
Yes, yes,
this is Dr. Crane speaking.

37
00:01:40,533 --> 00:01:42,902
Uh, Herr Brumholt, may I say
it's, uh, quite an honor.

38
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:43,937
Ja, ja, ja.

39
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:45,905
Uh, we have your face--
very handsome--

40
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:48,374
but I need you
to describe your body.

41
00:01:48,374 --> 00:01:49,776
Yes, of course.

42
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:51,711
Uh, six foot one...

43
00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:54,114
um... medium build...

44
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,982
broad shoulders...

45
00:01:55,982 --> 00:01:58,885
sublimely proportioned.

46
00:01:58,885 --> 00:02:01,754
That's good,ja,
but before I order my marble

47
00:02:01,754 --> 00:02:03,756
I need you
to describe your, um--

48
00:02:03,756 --> 00:02:05,258
how do I say this,ja,hmm--

49
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:06,759
your where you sit,ja?

50
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:08,228
Oh, my posterior.

51
00:02:08,228 --> 00:02:10,263
Yes, well, that is
a little sensitive, isn't it?

52
00:02:10,263 --> 00:02:11,264
Oh, you don't want to tell me?

53
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:12,265
I understand.

54
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:13,266
It's a big one?

55
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:15,268
No, no, no, no,
I didn't say that.

56
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:17,270
Angie, order the big marble,
please,ja.

57
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:21,274
No, no, no, um, could you
please put Dr. Kaufman back on?

58
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:23,209
No, I have better idea.

59
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:24,644
Why don't you send us a picture

60
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:26,913
(losing accent):
of your immensehind quarters

61
00:02:26,913 --> 00:02:30,183
and send it in
to KACL's new morning team...

62
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:32,185
BOTH:
Carlos and The Chicken!

63
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:34,454
(clucking)

64
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,263
Dr. Kaufman?

65
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:45,265
Angie?

66
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:54,941
Morning.

67
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:56,376
Good morning,
Dr. Crane.

68
00:02:56,376 --> 00:02:58,211
You won't believe
what just happened to me.

69
00:02:58,211 --> 00:03:00,346
I was the victim
of a radio prank.

70
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:01,681
Oh, that's terrible.

71
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:02,549
Yes.

72
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:04,417
It's a sad day
when getting a man

73
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:06,386
to describe his own behind
passes as humor.

74
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:08,721
(laughing)

75
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:11,057
You heard the whole thing,
didn't you?

76
00:03:11,057 --> 00:03:12,392
Ja.

77
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:13,326
Oh...

78
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,797
I'm sorry, Dr. Crane,
but they can be funny.

79
00:03:17,797 --> 00:03:19,265
Oh, that's all right, Daphne.

80
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:21,768
Carlos and The Chicken
are the sort of performers

81
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:23,770
who keep popping up
on the radio these days--

82
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:26,706
so-called "humorists"
who rely on cruel pranks

83
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:28,107
and scatological references.

84
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:30,109
Well, I suppose
that's the sort of thing

85
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:32,111
that passes for entertainment
these days.

86
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:34,447
You know, perhaps it's
just a generational thing.

87
00:03:34,447 --> 00:03:36,683
Man, they got you good!

88
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:40,553
The Chicken was on fire!

89
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:41,988
What a great bit.

90
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:43,756
Yeah, I think it'll be
bit of the day.

91
00:03:43,756 --> 00:03:45,024
For God sakes,
I'm going back to bed.

92
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:46,526
Oh, hey, hey, Fras,
wait a minute.

93
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:49,028
Uh, do you think you can
get me a tape of the show?

94
00:03:49,028 --> 00:03:50,096
What on earth for?

95
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:51,097
How often do you get

96
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:52,565
to hear your son
on the radio?

97
00:03:55,602 --> 00:03:57,870
I'm on the radio every day!

98
00:04:04,777 --> 00:04:05,712
Thank you very much.

99
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:06,713
Hello, Roz.

100
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:08,281
I suppose you've heard

101
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:09,782
about my unscheduled
appearance

102
00:04:09,782 --> 00:04:11,584
on KACL's new
morning show today?

103
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:13,219
No. What happened?

104
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:15,355
Well, less said
about it, the better.

105
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:16,623
Come on, Frasier,
why don't you pull up

106
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:19,525
a couple of chairs
and tell me about it?

107
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:22,962
Was everyone
in Seattle listening

108
00:04:22,962 --> 00:04:24,397
at 6:00 in the morning?

109
00:04:24,397 --> 00:04:25,331
Did they do it at 6:00?

110
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:26,733
I heard the replay at 8:00.

111
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:28,568
I heard it at 9:15.

112
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,404
Congratulations,
you were bit of the day.

113
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:32,905
Oh, Lord.

114
00:04:32,905 --> 00:04:36,209
I thought the entire thing
was rude and childish.

115
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:38,511
Well, you're just mad
because you fell for it.

116
00:04:38,511 --> 00:04:39,379
Come on, Frasier--

117
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:40,747
"Hall of Thinkers"?

118
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:41,748
Well...

119
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:43,216
it's not such a bad idea.

120
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:46,719
In a society where we glorify
our athletes and rock musicians,

121
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:48,221
I think maybe we should...

122
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:49,722
Well, it was early.

123
00:04:49,722 --> 00:04:50,923
Sorry.

124
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:53,126
Oh, hey, look, that's them
over there with Kenny.

125
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,328
Wow, The Chicken's
a lot cuter

126
00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:56,663
than on his billboards.

127
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:59,666
Of course, he's not squatting
in a feather suit

128
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,134
trying to hatch Carlos's head.

129
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,102
You know, I think I
might just go over there

130
00:05:03,102 --> 00:05:04,103
and introduce myself.

131
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:06,439
I don't know
what you're thinking, but don't.

132
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:08,274
I'm going to go over
there and let them know

133
00:05:08,274 --> 00:05:10,610
that what they did today was
completely unacceptable.

134
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:11,944
Frasier,
I know guys like this.

135
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:13,446
Once they know
they can rattle you,

136
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:14,447
they never stop.

137
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:15,948
Just take your lumps
and laugh it off.

138
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:18,418
Roz, I'm perfectly capable
of laughing it off.

139
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:20,920
I just want to let them know
that I do not appreciate

140
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,755
being made the punch line
at my own station.

141
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:24,424
I'm going to go
over and tell them

142
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:25,758
that from now on,
I don't want

143
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:27,193
to be part of
their shenanigans.

144
00:05:27,193 --> 00:05:30,396
Oh, God,please don't say
"shenanigans."

145
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:34,300
Hello, Kenny.

146
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,268
Oh.

147
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:38,171
I believe introductions
are in order.

148
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:40,106
Oh, uh, right, uh,
Dr. Frasier Crane,

149
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:41,607
this is The Chicken
and Carlos.

150
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:43,009
Uh, uh...
What?

151
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,411
We're actually called
Carlos and The Chicken.

152
00:05:45,411 --> 00:05:47,347
Yes, well,
nice to meet you, boys.

153
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,281
Uh, about this morning...

154
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:49,582
KENNY::
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

155
00:05:49,582 --> 00:05:52,819
I don't want to see
any feathers flying, here.

156
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:53,753
(laughing)

157
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:54,654
Just kidding.

158
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:57,156
Dr. Crane, I hope we
didn't go too far.

159
00:05:57,156 --> 00:05:58,091
We love your show.

160
00:05:58,091 --> 00:05:59,492
Really?

161
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:00,426
You're listeners?

162
00:06:00,426 --> 00:06:01,427
Oh, yeah, yeah,
we're big fans.

163
00:06:01,427 --> 00:06:02,929
You know, the last
thing we want to do

164
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:04,430
is step on your toes.

165
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,899
Well, you know,
you do tread a fine line

166
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:08,401
with your style of comedy,

167
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:10,403
but, uh,
perhaps you can be excused

168
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:12,405
for stomping on it
rather exuberantly

169
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:13,373
on your first day.

170
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,742
Just keep in mind
in the future

171
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:18,411
that this station does have
a certain pecking order.

172
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:19,245
(laughing)

173
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:21,247
We totally get it,
Dr. Crane.

174
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:23,082
I-it felt wrong
when we did it.

175
00:06:23,082 --> 00:06:24,350
Oh, well...
CHICKEN:
It sure did.

176
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:25,752
You sure you're not
upset or anything?

177
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:26,652
Oh, no, no, no.

178
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:28,187
No harm, no fowl.

179
00:06:28,187 --> 00:06:29,989
(all laughing)

180
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:31,791
Hey, it was great
meeting you, Dr. Crane.

181
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:32,792
Likewise, boys.

182
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:34,193
Hey, listen,
call me Frasier,

183
00:06:34,193 --> 00:06:36,095
but... don't call me at home.

184
00:06:36,095 --> 00:06:39,332
Dr. Crane,
we're listening.

185
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:40,600
(laughing)

186
00:06:42,101 --> 00:06:43,102
Well...

187
00:06:43,102 --> 00:06:44,070
Is it over?

188
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,037
I couldn't look.

189
00:06:45,037 --> 00:06:46,873
For God's sake, Roz,
have a little faith in me.

190
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:49,675
After all, I do reason
with people for a living.

191
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:51,244
It's all settled.

192
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:54,180
You know, they're...
they're good kids, really.

193
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,248
(chuckles)

194
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,083
Quite sensible, actually.

195
00:06:57,083 --> 00:07:00,420
Yeah... if you go for oversexed,
beer-belching, frat-boy types,

196
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:01,921
which I do.

197
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:04,157
Was The Chicken wearing
a wedding ring?

198
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:07,293
You know, I really
did overreact this
morning, I think.

199
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:10,430
After all, it was sort
of cute, I suppose.

200
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,431
(chuckling)

201
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:12,932
"Hall of Thinkers."

202
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:13,766
(laughing)

203
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:15,635
Never let it be said
that Frasier Crane is

204
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:16,636
the kind of man
who's incapable

205
00:07:17,136 --> 00:07:18,137
of laughing at himself.

206
00:07:18,137 --> 00:07:19,138
These are for you.

207
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:20,540
Oh.

208
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,974
(laughing):
Yes, I see.

209
00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:24,977
Some patron has sent
me some... sticky buns.

210
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:25,845
(laughing)

211
00:07:25,845 --> 00:07:26,846
That's very funny.

212
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:28,347
Very funny,
indeed, yes.

213
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:29,715
You ordered those, sir.

214
00:07:29,715 --> 00:07:30,583
Oh, so I did.

215
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:31,584
Thank you.

216
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:38,591
(doorbell rings)

217
00:07:39,091 --> 00:07:40,460
No kidding?

218
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,396
He's flying you to Vegas
for the fight?

219
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:46,232
That's a great son
you got there, Duke.

220
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:49,368
Good morning,
Dr. Crane.

221
00:07:49,368 --> 00:07:50,369
Hello, Daphne...

222
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:51,237
Dad.

223
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:52,805
Frasier, I thought you might
like to join me.

224
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:54,307
I'm going down to Abigail's

225
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:55,708
to have
my crepe pans re seasoned.

226
00:07:57,543 --> 00:07:59,011
Gosh, I'd love to, Niles,

227
00:07:59,011 --> 00:08:00,880
but I've just drawn myself
a nice herbal bath.

228
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,719
Uh, no, no, it's just Daphne.

229
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:08,588
She's watching PBS.

230
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:11,858
Okay, I'll talk
to you later, Duke.

231
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:13,793
Does the whole world
have to know

232
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:15,294
what goes on in this house?

233
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:17,296
Help yourself to
some coffee, Niles.

234
00:08:17,296 --> 00:08:18,798
Thank you.

235
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:20,299
Dr. Crane,
how do you know it's time

236
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:22,802
to have your crepe
pans seasoned, anyway?

237
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:25,638
It can be confusing,
but this may help.

238
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:27,940
"Saucepans in summer,
crepe pans in fall,

239
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:31,210
when winter's upon us,
there's food for us all."

240
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:35,181
(phone ringing)

241
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,183
Whoever it is, I am not home.

242
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,117
I am not here.

243
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:41,587
Hello?

244
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:42,588
Yeah, is Dr. Crane there?

245
00:08:42,588 --> 00:08:44,090
Uh, no, actually,
he's taking a bath.

246
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:45,091
Who's this?

247
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:46,592
This is his brother, Niles.

248
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:47,593
Oh, okay, well, see,

249
00:08:47,593 --> 00:08:49,462
this is
the building superintendent.

250
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:51,664
I'm in the bathroom
just below his,

251
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:54,033
and I think the pipes
are getting corroded.

252
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:57,370
Is your brother putting
anything unusual in his bath?

253
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:00,273
I'm not exactly sure
what he puts in his bath.

254
00:09:00,773 --> 00:09:02,241
Uh, better let me ask him.

255
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,746
I smell a bit.

256
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:08,214

You know very well
it's a proprietary blend, Niles.

No, no, no, it's your super.

264
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:27,466
There's something corroding

about a little

280
00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:00,232
I think we got
a bad tile.

281
00:10:00,232 --> 00:10:01,601
I sure would like to check it.

282
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:04,103
I heard you singing
through the phone earlier.

290
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:20,219
You know,
I could isolate the tile

291
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:21,988
if you could
just walk around

292

a little bit
while you sang.

293

I could send my assistant,

Oh, dear God!

329
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:42,902
Now, now,
don't worry.

330
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:44,770
It won't get you down for long.

331
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:46,272
You've always had
a thick skin...

332
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:49,108
unless that Tahitian vanilla
softened you up a bit.

333
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:49,809
Get out!

334
00:11:58,684 --> 00:12:00,119
Leave me alone!

335
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:02,555
For God's sake,
have some respect!

336
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:08,360
Was that Mrs. Kurtzman?

337
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,730
She dropped her medication
in the hallway.

338
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,232
As I stooped to pick it up,
out came her camera

339
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:14,467
like an assassin's blade.

340
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:18,170
Well, if she wants
to control those blood clots

341
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:20,573
she'll cough up that film.

342
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:27,813
You're really getting riled up.

343
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:29,515
I certainly am.

344
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:31,317
Well, come on.
They're just pranks, you know?

345
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:32,351
Back on the force,

346
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:34,820
we used to do stuff
like this all the time.

347
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,856
We'd fill a guy's hat
with shaving cream

348
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:38,224
or nail his shoes
to the floor.

349
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:41,127
Sometimes we'd get a guy
dead drunk and then leave him

350
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:42,628
in a drawer in the morgue.

351
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,432
(doorbell rings)

352
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:47,233
You know, Dad,

353
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:49,068
I might have been able
to laugh it off

354
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:53,472
if all of Seattle hadn't started
stalking me with cameras.

355
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:56,342
Quickly, Niles, inside!
Come on!

356
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:58,778
Why didn't you hold
the elevator?

357
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,279
Didn't you hear me shouting?

358
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,247
That was you?

359
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:02,748
I'm sorry, Niles.

360
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:04,750
I was afraid you were trying
to get a picture of my butt.

361
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:11,590
How exciting to be present
at the birth of a new phobia.

362
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:14,960
I'm talking about Carlos
and The Chicken.

363
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,462
Oh, yes, their
little contest.

364
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,964
I can't believe
anyone's taking
that seriously.

365
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:20,733
Well, they won't be
for much longer.

366
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:23,002
I've decided it's
time to fight back.

367
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:24,937
I was up till all
hours last night

368
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:27,506
crafting my response
to those two idiots.

369
00:13:27,506 --> 00:13:29,008
I believe I
have arrived

370
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:30,342
at a masterful
rebuttal.

371
00:13:30,342 --> 00:13:32,978
I'm not sure you want
to call it your rebuttal.

372
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,382
Oh, I see your
Bartlett's is out.

373
00:13:36,382 --> 00:13:38,384
You're not pulling
any punches.

374
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:39,285
Hardly.

375
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:41,654
I go in swinging
with La Rochefoucauld.

376
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,155
"If we had no faults
of our own

377
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:45,124
"we would not take
so much pleasure

378
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:46,625
in noticing those of others."

379
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:48,093
Ouch!

380
00:13:48,093 --> 00:13:49,361
Mm-hmm.

381
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:52,565
Just as I've got
them reeling,

382
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:54,066
I go in with a jab
of Dorothy Parker:

383
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:56,068
"Wit has truth in it;

384
00:13:56,068 --> 00:13:59,572
wisecracking is merely
calisthenics with words."

385
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:00,539
Pow!

386
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:02,007
Just as they're
bloodied

387
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:04,243
and against the ropes,
I go in for the kill

388
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:07,346
with Twain, Wilde, Twain,
Twain, Mencken!

389
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:10,115
It's not a fight,
it's an execution!

390
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:12,117
You know, Frasier,

391
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:13,619
you go and read that
on the air,

392
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:15,120
you're going to set
yourself up

393
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,121
for a year
of abuse.

394
00:14:16,121 --> 00:14:17,623
You know, this kind of
thing is probably why

395
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:18,624
those guys started
picking on you

396
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:20,125
in the first place.

397
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,127
All right, fine, Dad,
what exactly are you saying?

398
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:24,930
That I somehow managed to bring
this misery on myself?

399
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:27,233
No, I'm not saying that.
I'm just...

400
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:29,768
have you ever wondered
why these bullies have

401
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:31,770
always kind of zeroed in
on you two?

402
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:33,272
No, we don't wonder why.

403
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:34,273
We know the reason.

404
00:14:34,273 --> 00:14:35,674
Jealousy.
Jealousy.

405
00:14:35,674 --> 00:14:38,077
Okay, there's a little bit
of that, too

406
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:41,080
but, you know, you kind of give
people the impression

407
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,414
that you're above them.

408
00:14:42,414 --> 00:14:43,249
Pishtosh.

409
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:44,250
Poppycock.

410
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,252
Morning, Daphne.

411
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:47,753
Oh, Daphne, tell me,

412
00:14:47,753 --> 00:14:50,155
do you think we're snobby,
superior and condescending?

413
00:14:50,155 --> 00:14:51,056
That's it.

414
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:52,892
I'm getting me door
soundproofed.

415
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,527
MARTIN:
You see
what I mean?

416
00:14:55,527 --> 00:14:57,863
People think you're stuffy,
you know,

417
00:14:57,863 --> 00:15:00,833
with your opera parties
and your wine parties

418
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:02,801
and your seasoned crepe pans.

419
00:15:02,801 --> 00:15:04,737
In my defense,
Niles is the only one

420
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:07,106
who has ever seasoned
his crepe pans.

421
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:09,508
Which is precisely why
I've had the same set

422
00:15:09,508 --> 00:15:11,977
since the ninth grade,
thank you very much.

423
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:17,182
My point is, you guys could
never resist putting on airs.

424
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:18,951
Even when you were
in junior high,

425
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:21,320
you used to love that TV
program,The Avengers.

426
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,589
Used to run all over
the neighborhood

427
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:26,325
pretending you were that guy
with the umbrella, Steve.

428
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:27,326
Steed.

429
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:28,727
Dad...
Oh, God.

430
00:15:28,727 --> 00:15:30,896
FRASIER:
There were worse
role models.

431
00:15:30,896 --> 00:15:32,197
Steed was dapper
and witty.

432
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:33,699
When anyone tried
to give him grief,

433
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:36,502
he gave them a sound
thrashing with his umbrella.

434
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:38,304
Great. That's fine.
Admire him if you want,

435
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:40,306
but did you have to run
through the neighborhood

436
00:15:40,806 --> 00:15:41,774
in bowler hats?

437
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:44,209
You were just begging
to get beat up.

438
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:45,644
Come to think of it,

439
00:15:45,644 --> 00:15:47,579
it was rather a rough summer
that year, wasn't it?

440
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:49,515
I remember getting
a chin strap

441
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:51,951
so the bowler wouldn't fall off
when I ran.

442
00:15:53,852 --> 00:15:55,854
And all that did was make you

443
00:15:55,854 --> 00:15:58,324
look like Elizabeth Taylor
in National Velvet.

444
00:15:58,324 --> 00:16:00,759
But, look,

445
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:02,628
my point is,

446
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,997
you go down to the station
and read that over the air,

447
00:16:04,997 --> 00:16:06,932
then you might as
well go down there

448
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:08,334
in a great big bowler hat.

449
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:10,602
Those people are never going
to let you forget it.

450
00:16:10,602 --> 00:16:12,805
It's funny hearing
you talk about
The Avengers.

451
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,673
My first Halloween in America,

452
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:16,642
I went to a party
dressed as Mrs. Peel.

453
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,143
Head to toe

454
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:20,012
in that skintight black
leather cat suit.

455
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:21,347
Come to think of it,

456
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:22,648
I still have
it somewhere

457
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:23,449
and Halloween's coming up.

458
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:25,250
Cat suit.

459
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,552
Better not let this guy
hear you talk about that

460
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:27,820
or he'll go nuts.

461
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,555
I would not...

462
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:37,663
...be surprised
if he did.

463
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,598
(chuckles)

464
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:41,433
(phone rings)

465
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:42,301
FRASIER:
Excuse me.

466
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:43,802
Hello.

467
00:16:43,802 --> 00:16:45,304
All right, Roz, yes.

468
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:46,705
Just calm down.

469
00:16:46,705 --> 00:16:48,874
No, no, I'm not listening.
Hang on a second.

470
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:51,510
FRASIER (on radio):
Roz...
(erotic moaning)

471
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,278
Oh, dear God.

472
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:55,547
CARLOS:
I think we're going
to have to throw

473
00:16:55,547 --> 00:16:57,349
a bucket of water on these two.

474
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:59,852
CHICKEN:
Roz and Frasier stop by
for a quick hello.

475
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,854
Next thing you know,
they're getting it on

476
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,355
right in the booth!

477
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:04,256
FRASIER:
Roz!

478
00:17:04,256 --> 00:17:05,691
ROZ:
Frasier.

479
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:06,592
Roz.

480
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:08,360
Frasier.

481
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,629
Do we have time to squeeze
in one more?

482
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:12,498
Plenty of time, Frasier.

483
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:14,867
Two more minutes.

484
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,736
For a man carrying around
a good 50 extra pounds of ass,

485
00:17:17,736 --> 00:17:20,239
Frasier Crane has got
unbelievable stamina.

486
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:22,107
Frasier, where do you get
your energy?

487
00:17:22,107 --> 00:17:25,477
FRASIER:
Lavender, rose hips,
and a little Tahitian vanilla.

488
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:27,246
CARLOS:
Oh, my God!

489
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:28,514
They're changing
positions.

490
00:17:28,514 --> 00:17:30,249
I've never seen
that one before.

491
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:34,853
FRASIER:
Love does enter
through the nose.

492
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:36,555
(erotic moaning continues)

493
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:38,791
FRASIER:
I'll call you back, Roz.

494
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:39,591
I'm going down there.

495
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:40,592
MARTIN:
Frasier!

496
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:42,094
Dad, don't try to talk
me out of this.

497
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:44,096
I'm going to teach
those two a lesson

498
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:45,597
they'll not soon forget.

499
00:17:45,597 --> 00:17:46,365
Where's my umbrella?

500
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:47,733
Oh, no, not that again!

501
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:50,035
Not the umbrella!
I'm begging you!

502
00:17:50,035 --> 00:17:51,804
It's raining!

503
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:53,338
No! No! Stop!

504
00:17:57,376 --> 00:17:58,377
Roz, what are you
doing here?

505
00:17:58,877 --> 00:18:00,379
I'm getting revenge,
that's what.

506
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:02,381
These guys are going down!

507
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:03,382
Stop it.
Stop it, Roz.

508
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:04,883
Did you hear
the disgusting,

509
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:06,785
vile things they
said about me?

510
00:18:06,785 --> 00:18:08,187
Just the part
about us having sex.

511
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:09,988
Exactly!

512
00:18:09,988 --> 00:18:10,789
Not only that.

513
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:13,625
They've got a photo
contest about me now, too.

514
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,427
Roz, a thousand dollars
for a shot of your behind?

515
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:16,395
I'm sorry, Roz.

516
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:19,364
No, it's 50 bucks
and a six pack.

517
00:18:19,364 --> 00:18:20,365
And there were
seven winners

518
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:22,167
before I even
left the house!

519
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:22,968
I'm sorry.

520
00:18:22,968 --> 00:18:23,969
Frasier, what
should we do?

521
00:18:23,969 --> 00:18:25,304
Could we slash
their tires?

522
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:26,638
Could we crack
their windshields?

523
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:28,307
I was thinking
of a more direct approach.

524
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:29,308
Oh, I'm down with that, too.

525
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:30,809
Next commercial,
I'll get The Chicken,

526
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:31,777
you take the big guy.

527
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,712
No, no, no, that's not it
and you know it, Roz!

528
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:35,214
I knew you'd say that.

529
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:36,215
Fine. I'll take
the big guy!

530
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:37,983
No, no, Roz, stop it!
Listen to yourself!

531
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:40,185
You're lusting for blood
like a barbarian!

532
00:18:40,185 --> 00:18:42,888
I have a more civilized
approach in mind.

533
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:44,857
I have composed a speech.

534
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:49,661
A speech?
Yes.

535
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:51,029
Unless you plan
to roll it up

536
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:52,531
and cram it down
their throats,

537
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:54,032
what good is that
going to do?

538
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:55,033
You just watch and see.
No, Frasier.

539
00:18:55,033 --> 00:18:57,536
They're never going to stop
making fun of you.

540
00:18:57,536 --> 00:18:58,537
Roz, I don't care.

541
00:18:58,537 --> 00:18:59,905
I've just figured
out something.

542
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:02,274
Maybe you can't stop
bullies from attacking you,

543
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:03,275
but the only way they win

544
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:04,776
is if they change
who you are,

545
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:06,278
and I'll tell
you something.

546
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:07,279
Let them do their worst.

547
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:09,214
They will not knock
the bowler off this head!

548
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:13,519
What does that mean?!

549
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:16,755
Holy cow! Look
who just walked
into the booth,

550
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:19,491
Frasier Crane,
the automatic sex pilot.

551
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,126
What's up, love doctor?

552
00:19:21,126 --> 00:19:22,895
Oh, I think you
two know what's up.

553
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:24,796
There's only so much
I can take.

554
00:19:24,796 --> 00:19:27,166
Only so much anyone can take
from a juvenile comic

555
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,934
and his straight man!

556
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:30,702
I believe it was
La Rochefoucauld...

557
00:19:30,702 --> 00:19:32,137
I'll take my straight man

558
00:19:32,137 --> 00:19:34,640
over your sex-starved producer
any day, my friend.

559
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,641
Okay, buddy!

560
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:38,410
Roz, let me handle this!

561
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:39,178
Hey, hey,
wait a second.

562
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,679
I'm not your
straight man.

563
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,181
If anything,
I'm the funny one.

564
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,682
Let's not start
this again, okay?

565
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:45,150
You're the one
who started it
on the air.

566
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:47,619
It was La Rochefoucauld
who first said...

567
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:48,620
You always do this.

568
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:50,622
Hey, Carlos,
the therapist said

569
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:52,424
not to use the word
"always."

570
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:53,759
I just wish that
you could say

571
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:54,760
that I'm as
funny as you are.

572
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,261
I wish I could
say that, too,

573
00:19:56,261 --> 00:19:57,596
but who does
all the funny voices?

574
00:19:57,596 --> 00:19:58,931
La Rochefoucauld once said...

575
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:00,199
If I'm so unfunny,

576
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,466
how come I get
offered solo gigs?

577
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:02,968
Oh, well, now
I'm laughing! Ha-ha!

578
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:03,936
Don't believe me?

579
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:05,470
Ask our agent.

580
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:07,272
You talked to Zachary
behind my back?

581
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:08,574
Gentlemen, if I could
get a word in here...

582
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:09,575
I tell you what, man.

583
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:11,076
You think you can go out
on your own,

584
00:20:11,076 --> 00:20:12,377
go ahead, be my guest.

585
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:13,679
Great! 'Cause I
don't need you,

586
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,081
and I don't need
"Carlos and The Chicken"!

587
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:16,982
CHICKEN:
Oh, really?

588
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:18,283
Well, best of
luck, funny boy.

589
00:20:18,283 --> 00:20:20,118
Same to you, Dwayne!

590
00:20:20,118 --> 00:20:22,621
Hey, man, that is not cool.

591
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:24,056
Chicken, I believe

592
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,958
it was La Rochefoucauld,
the great French thinker...

593
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,926
Would you give it a rest,
double-wide.

594
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:28,927
I went to grad school, too.

595
00:20:28,927 --> 00:20:30,395
And P.S.:

596
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:32,731
It's pronounced
La Rochefoucauld.

597
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:33,932
That's it!

598
00:20:33,932 --> 00:20:35,834
Nobody corrects
my French pronunciation...!

599
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:39,404
Chicken!

600
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:41,306
Oh, my God, did you
have to be so vicious?

601
00:20:41,306 --> 00:20:42,140
Me?

602
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,008
Oh, we got dead air.

603
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:44,009
Just take over.

604
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:45,510
Right. Right.

605
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:46,511
Hello, Seattle.

606
00:20:46,511 --> 00:20:48,013
This is Dr. Frasier Crane.

607
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:50,015
I'll be filling in
for the last hour

608
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:53,018
of The Morning Zoo

609
00:20:53,018 --> 00:20:58,490
with my own particular brand
of zany antics.

610
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:00,025
Well, let's see. Um...

611
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:04,029
ah, you know, there was
a fabulous cartoon

612
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:06,531
in the recent New Yorker.

613
00:21:06,531 --> 00:21:09,034
Let me see if I can describe it
for you.

614
00:21:14,573 --> 00:21:17,042
♪ Hey, baby,

624

What is a boy to do?

625
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:48,140
Good night!
