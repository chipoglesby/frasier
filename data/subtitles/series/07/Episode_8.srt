1
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,443
Why did I ever decide to
redecorate my bathroom?

2
00:00:10,443 --> 00:00:12,946
They give you about
1,000 decisions to make.

3
00:00:12,946 --> 00:00:15,949
After a while, you
can't even tell
the colors apart.

4
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:17,951
Roz, perhaps
my discerning
decorator's eye

5
00:00:17,951 --> 00:00:19,452
could be
of some assistance.

6
00:00:19,452 --> 00:00:20,453
Let me see here.

7
00:00:20,453 --> 00:00:22,455
This one's Ecru,
that's Eggshell

8
00:00:22,455 --> 00:00:24,457
and this, of course,
is Navajo white.

9
00:00:24,457 --> 00:00:25,358
Very good, Frasier.

10
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:29,562
Now, let's see how you
do on the color side.

11
00:00:30,764 --> 00:00:32,032
You know, Roz,
I do hope

12
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,967
you don't spend
your entire vacation

13
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:35,001
redecorating, you know.

14
00:00:35,001 --> 00:00:37,003
You should get out,
you know, have some fun,

15
00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:38,004
maybe take a cruise.

16
00:00:38,004 --> 00:00:40,006
You don't want to stay
in your apartment

17
00:00:40,006 --> 00:00:42,275
cooped up with a bunch
of sweaty workmen.

18
00:00:44,944 --> 00:00:46,279
Bon voyage.

19
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:49,182
Thank you,
and don't worry.

20
00:00:49,182 --> 00:00:50,683
Chuck Ranberg said
he'd take over...

21
00:00:50,683 --> 00:00:51,985
Absolutely not, Roz.

22
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:53,219
The man's
speech impediment

23
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:54,254
made me giggle
all week long.

24
00:00:54,254 --> 00:00:56,556
Show a little compassion.

25
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:58,291
Oh, come on. You try dealing
with a call screener

26
00:00:58,291 --> 00:01:02,295
who says, "Dr. Cwane, we have
a kweptomaniac on line thwee."

27
00:01:02,295 --> 00:01:05,165
Well, who do you
want to use?

28
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:06,066
Actually,
I was thinking

29
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,067
of reaching out
to the community.

30
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,568
You know, I was guest
speaker last month

31
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:10,070
at a program
called Second Start.

32
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,572
They offer career training
to people who are stuck

33
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,074
in tedious, low-paying jobs,

34
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:17,077
and, uh, well,
I thought I'd give the job

35
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,511
to one of those students.

36
00:01:18,511 --> 00:01:19,446
That's a great idea, Frasier.

37
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:21,214
It sounds like a great program.

38
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:22,449
Oh, dear,
there's Chuck Ranberg.

39
00:01:22,449 --> 00:01:23,983
Roz, you've got
to tell him

40
00:01:23,983 --> 00:01:24,918
he doesn't
have the job.

41
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:25,885
Why can't you
tell him?

42
00:01:25,885 --> 00:01:27,287
I'm sorry.
I can't hear the man speak

43
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:28,655
without descending
into giggles.

44
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:30,757
Oh, you are such a child.

45
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,092
Roz, just...

46
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:33,093
Hi, guys.

47
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:34,594
Hey, Chuck, how's
it going?

48
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:36,963
Oh, tewible, Woz.

49
00:01:36,963 --> 00:01:38,798
My wife was in
the cawibbean

50
00:01:38,798 --> 00:01:41,734
and she weft me
for a wastafawian.

51
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:50,577
FRASIER:
You know,
we have a couple of minutes,

52
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:51,578
before the show, so listen,

53
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:53,012
tell me a little bit
about yourself.

54
00:01:53,012 --> 00:01:55,014
How did you get
interested in broadcasting?

55
00:01:55,014 --> 00:01:57,016
Well, after I got laid
off from the bakery,

56
00:01:57,016 --> 00:01:58,017
I guess I had
some free time,

57
00:01:58,518 --> 00:02:01,020
so I took a few different
night school courses,

58
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,522
and when I got
to the one in radio,

59
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:03,456
it all clicked.

60
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:05,892
Oh, well, now,
isn't that funny.

61
00:02:05,892 --> 00:02:09,162
You know, I had almost
exactly the same experience.

62
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:11,464
I first discovered psychiatry

63
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:14,968
in Dr. Bagely's epidemiology
seminar at Harvard.

64
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:18,505
Except I bet you
didn't walk through

65
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:20,573
a metal detector
to get to class.

66
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:22,575
No, no, but you know,
I did have to pass under

67
00:02:22,575 --> 00:02:24,577
a dangerously
unbalanced portrait

68
00:02:24,577 --> 00:02:26,913
of Alfred Adler in the rotunda.

69
00:02:26,913 --> 00:02:29,582
We are practically
separated at birth.

70
00:02:29,582 --> 00:02:31,050
Oh, ten seconds, Mary.
Here we go.

71
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,018
I'm so nervous.

72
00:02:32,018 --> 00:02:33,052
I don't know
what to do.

73
00:02:33,052 --> 00:02:34,053
Oh, you'll be fine.

74
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:35,555
Just relax.
Okay.

75
00:02:41,928 --> 00:02:43,363
Hello, Seattle.

76
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:47,567
This is Dr. Frasier Crane,
and I'm listening.

77
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:48,801
I'd like to take
this opportunity

78
00:02:48,801 --> 00:02:49,736
to introduce someone

79
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:52,272
who's going to bring
her own flavor to the show

80
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:54,240
this week while Roz
is gone.

81
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,708
Say hello
to Mary Thomas.

82
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:02,882
It's great to have you
with us, Mary.

83
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,854
You know, we want to get
right to your calls, folks,

84
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,822
so we'll be right back
after this.

85
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:14,527
Mary, uh...

86
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,029
I should mention that
you should feel free

87
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:18,431
to speak on the air.

88
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:20,733
You know, Roz often chimes in
from time to time.

89
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:22,669
Oh, I can't believe
I messed up so quickly.

90
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:24,103
No, no, no,
not at all,
not at all.

91
00:03:24,103 --> 00:03:26,940
Promise me you'll speak up
when it feels right.

92
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,775
I will.
Okay, great.

93
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:30,610
I'm sure you have
excellent instincts.

94
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,545
Five seconds.
Right.

95
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:36,382
And we're back.

96
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:38,718
All right, Mary,
who's our first caller?

97
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,553
Maria.

98
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:45,959
Uh, she's 36 years old.

99
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:48,761
Married five years,

100
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:51,130
and her husband's been
staying late at the office

101
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:52,465
so he can be
with his secretary.

102
00:03:52,465 --> 00:03:54,267
That's the way to do it.

103
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:56,769
I mean, uh... I...

104
00:03:56,769 --> 00:03:58,137
Sorry, Maria.

105
00:03:58,137 --> 00:04:00,340
Uh,
I'm listening.

106
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,708
Oh, hi, Dr. Crane.

107
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:04,544
Anyway, he's having an affair
and it's not his first.

108
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:06,346
This has been going on
since we were newlyweds.

109
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:08,615
How do I get him to change?

110
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:10,416
Well, Maria, you,
of course, know

111
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:13,419
that it's impossible to force
anyone to change,

112
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:16,723
but you can work
to change yourself.

113
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:18,057
Usually women
who tolerate

114
00:04:18,057 --> 00:04:19,559
this sort of behavior
from their husbands

115
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:21,394
are suffering from
low self-esteem issues.

116
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:22,729
Now, you may need
some counseling

117
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:24,530
to resolve those issues.
Let me ask...

118
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:25,765
May I say something?

119
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:27,600
Yes.

120
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,103
Maria, Dr. Crane
is right.

121
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:31,904
You must make
a change.

122
00:04:31,904 --> 00:04:34,140
And the first thing you change
is the lock on your front door.

123
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,108
What?

124
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,476
Oh, listen, there's
plenty of time

125
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:37,343
for counselors,

126
00:04:37,343 --> 00:04:40,346
but at 6:00, locksmiths
start charging extra

127
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:42,115
so you get on it, girlfriend.

128
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,250
You know,

129
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,585
my Grandpa Willie used to say,

130
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:48,054
"Nothing stops a man
from playing the field faster

131
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:50,590
than a night out on the lawn."

132
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,592
Okay? Okay.

133
00:04:58,398 --> 00:05:01,868
Oh, thank you, Grandpa Willie.

134
00:05:06,105 --> 00:05:08,408
Look'ee here, Tony,
you're 35 years old.

135
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:10,576
Now, your parents only
had you for the first 18,

136
00:05:10,576 --> 00:05:11,944
so if you want to start
blaming someone,

137
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:13,446
maybe you need to
blame yourself.

138
00:05:13,446 --> 00:05:15,715
Okay? Okay.

139
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:21,988
Actually, chronic rage problems
usually stem from...

140
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,257
Oh, Dr. Crane,
we're all out of time.

141
00:05:28,294 --> 00:05:29,796
So we are.

142
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:32,298
Well, then,
this is Dr. Frasier Crane

143
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:35,134
saying good-bye, Seattle
and good mental health.

144
00:05:35,134 --> 00:05:37,503
And tune in
tomorrow!

145
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:44,077
Hello, Daphne.

146
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:45,078
Well, Dr. Crane,

147
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:46,412
you're in
a good mood today.

148
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:49,349
Hm-mmm. After six long weeks,

149
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,250
I have finally received
my yellow belt.

150
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,685
Well, aren't you lucky.

151
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:54,620
I ordered some mauve capri pants
two months ago,

152
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:57,123
and I'm still waiting.

153
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:00,560
No, no, no.

154
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,395
As this handsome certificate
will attest,

155
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:03,763
I finally attained

156
00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:05,264
the second level
of kickboxing.

157
00:06:05,264 --> 00:06:08,267
Oh, congratulations.

158
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:11,104
What made you take up
kickboxing?

159
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:12,939
Well, in order to protect Mel.

160
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:14,440
As you know,
she's a plastic surgeon.

161
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,909
She has a habit of
slipping her card
to total strangers

162
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:19,345
who she feels could use
her services.

163
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:21,814
So far, no harm done but...

164
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:22,782
It's only a matter of time

165
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:24,550
before you get
your lights punched out.

166
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,818
Exactly.

167
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:27,320
It almost happened last week
with Marjorie Dunsmore.

168
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,821
Luck was on our side,

169
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:31,824
but next time there might not be
a walker to kick over so...

170
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:35,161
But I think Dad
will be properly impressed

171
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:37,530
when I demonstrate
my precision footwork.

172
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:42,368
Whoa!

173
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:44,871
That's very
impressive,
Dr. Crane.

174
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:46,372
You know, I just remembered

175
00:06:46,372 --> 00:06:47,373
the Chihuly
needs a good dusting.

176
00:06:47,373 --> 00:06:48,808
Daphne, I thought you
cleaned that yesterday.

177
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:50,309
Oh, did I?

178
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:51,811
Hello, Niles. What
brings you here?

179
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:52,879
Here to demonstrate

180
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:55,882
my newly acquired
feet of fury.

181
00:06:58,151 --> 00:06:59,485
Carry on, Daphne.

182
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:00,319
Oh, Frasier, Frasier...

183
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,321
who was that woman
on your show today?

184
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:04,857
Oh, that was
Mary Thomas.

185
00:07:04,857 --> 00:07:07,360
She's filling in
for Roz this week.

186
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,829
Seemed to me like she
was filling in for you.

187
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:13,065
You're normally
so particular

188
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:14,133
about what happens
on your show.

189
00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:16,002
I'm surprised you let her
go on like that.

190
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:17,870
Well, I started to say something
and then I thought, well...

191
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:21,741
oh, it just...
might be very condescending.

192
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:23,209
I know why you
didn't say anything.

193
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:24,610
'Cause she's black.

194
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,045
Oh, that's ridiculous, Dad.

195
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:27,313
Race has nothing to do with it.

196
00:07:27,313 --> 00:07:28,848
Oh, come now,
Frasier.

197
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:31,150
You can't deny a certain measure
of guilt

198
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:33,653
living as you do in your
exclusive, lily-white world.

199
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:40,827
Niles, owning the CD
of "Ella sings Gershwin"

200
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:43,262
does not qualify you
as a soul brother.

201
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:45,264
You know, Fras,

202
00:07:45,264 --> 00:07:46,732
there's such a
thing as being

203
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:48,000
too sensitive
about this stuff.

204
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,269
Now, if it was Roz blabbing on
instead of this Mary,

205
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:52,171
you'd tell her to put
a sock in it, right?

206
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:53,072
Well, I suppose so,

207
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:55,074
but, you know, this
is different, Dad.

208
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:56,075
She's just starting out.

209
00:07:56,576 --> 00:07:58,511
I didn't want to squelch
her enthusiasm.

210
00:07:58,511 --> 00:07:59,846
Because she's black.

211
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:01,481
Dad, please, will you
just stop saying that?

212
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,282
Anyway,

213
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:05,585
I just have to deal with it
for a week till Roz gets back.

214
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:06,185
Black.

215
00:08:06,185 --> 00:08:07,320
Stop it!

216
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:11,791
My first roommate at Yale
was black.

217
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,759
Huntington Treadwell III?

218
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,261
He's hardly representative

219
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:16,996
of the African-American
experience, Niles.

220
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:19,298
His father was a pioneer
in Selma and Montgomery.

221
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:20,666
Yes, I believe

222
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:23,536
he built golf courses
all over the South.

223
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:25,538
Oh, speaking of golf,

224
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:28,040
Dad, I've become quite
the sportsman myself.

225
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,041
Oh.

226
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:30,042
What do you think
of that?

227
00:08:30,042 --> 00:08:32,044
Oh, it's very
nice, son.

228
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:35,381
But calligraphy
really isn't a sport.

229
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:39,552
It's more of a craft.

230
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:42,522
No, no, no, this is...
this is for kickboxing.

231
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,524
I finally reached
yellow belt status.

232
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:45,525
Hey, what do you know?

233
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,026
I'm proud of you.

234
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,528
No, come here.

235
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:53,132
Well, you know,
it requires a lot of talent.

236
00:08:53,132 --> 00:08:55,067
You know, you have to have
timing and balance...

237
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:56,502
the ability
to strike

238
00:08:56,502 --> 00:08:57,570
and instantly
retreat.

239
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:58,504
So, you kick them
and then run away?

240
00:08:58,504 --> 00:09:00,573
Yes, yes.

241
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:02,074
My instructor says
I'm a natural. Yes.

242
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:03,576
Can I show you
something?

243
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:04,577
Oh, yeah, sure.

244
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:06,078
I'll show you a...
I'll show you

245
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:08,514
a roundhouse
kick, all right?

246
00:09:08,514 --> 00:09:12,552
You sense
your assailant's presence.

247
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:15,555
You feel your body
in the space.

248
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,323
Where your opponent is.

249
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:18,090
And when you're ready...

250
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,592
you strike!

251
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,594
(grunting)

252
00:09:26,532 --> 00:09:28,801
What have I done?

253
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:31,170
Are you all right,
Daphne?

254
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:32,572
Yes.
Really?

255
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,073
No. I landed on my wrist.

256
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:35,374
It's really throbbing.

257
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:38,177
Oh, go get her
some ice, Niles.

258
00:09:38,177 --> 00:09:39,512
You know, Dad,

259
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:41,314
perhaps you're right.

260
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:43,149
Maybe I am too sensitive.

261
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:44,483
(phone ringing)

262
00:09:44,483 --> 00:09:45,985
Daphne, could you
get that, please?

263
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:50,690
Gabe, you must remember
that compulsive shopping

264
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:51,691
is an addiction.

265
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:54,026
There are no simple solutions.

266
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:55,428
Oh, I've got one.

267
00:09:56,862 --> 00:09:59,298
Cut those credit cards up
right now.

268
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:00,833
Okay? Okay.

269
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:02,668
Thanks, Dr. Mary.

270
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:06,806
Uh... you know, I hate to be
a stickler here, Gabe,

271
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:09,141
but as Mary would be
the first to point out,

272
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:10,142
she is not a doctor.

273
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:11,544
Oh, I don't mind.

274
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:12,945
Oh, call me Dr. Mary.

275
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:16,716
You know, Latifah's not
a real queen, right?

276
00:10:19,485 --> 00:10:20,987
Oh, you know what, doll babies?

277
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:22,822
We're all out of time
for today.

278
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:27,026
So we are.

279
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:29,695
Well, then,
this is Dr. Frasier Crane...

280
00:10:29,695 --> 00:10:31,530
And Dr. Mary!

281
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:38,537
...saying good-bye, Seattle
and good mental health.

282
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:43,643
Hey, guys!
Oh, Kenny.

283
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,878
Just checking in to see
how things are going.

284
00:10:45,878 --> 00:10:47,213
Are you kidding?

285
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:49,215
This is a dream
come true.

286
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:53,653
So, uh, you and Mary?

287
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,222
What do you
think of her?

288
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:57,523
Be honest.

289
00:10:57,523 --> 00:11:00,326
Well, I genuinely like her.

290
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:03,129
She's delightful
and... and... and dedicated.

291
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:06,465
And?

292
00:11:06,465 --> 00:11:07,900
Well, uh...

293
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,803
she does have a tendency
to sort of jump right in there

294
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:11,804
whenever she likes, you know,

295
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:14,807
and frankly, her method
of solving problems

296
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:16,809
is totally different
than mine.

297
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:18,678
Yeah, I'm nuts about her, too.

298
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:22,181
The contrast between you guys...

299
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:23,683
that's what get things
crackling.

300
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,184
I always thought your show

301
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:28,187
was the gold standard
of radio shrink chatter,

302
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:30,156
but this last week
has been even better.

303
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:31,957
You think so?

304
00:11:31,957 --> 00:11:32,792
Absolutely.

305
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:34,794
In fact, the boys upstairs

306
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:36,662
would like to make you two
a permanent team.

307
00:11:36,662 --> 00:11:39,098
Ah... who
am I kidding?

308
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:40,566
There are no boys upstairs.

309
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:41,534
I just love this show.

310
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,903
Okay?

311
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:46,238
This is so exciting.

312
00:11:46,238 --> 00:11:47,506
I cannot believe it.

313
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:48,874
Me neither.

314
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:50,142
KENNY:
And don't you
worry about Roz.

315
00:11:50,142 --> 00:11:52,445
I'm just going to switch her
over to Gil's show.

316
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:53,446
The hours are better,

317
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:55,448
and I'll even throw in
a 20% raise.

318
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:56,949
This is going to be great.

319
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:57,950
I bet you within a month,

320
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:00,419
you guys are going to have
the hottest ratings in Seattle.

321
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:01,320
Oh, this is so wonderful.

322
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:02,388
Thank you, both.

323
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:04,290
I'm going to go
call my parents.

324
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:06,158
Uh, listen, Kenny...

325
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:08,160
I know what you're
feeling right now, Doc,

326
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,695
and let me save you
the trouble.

327
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:11,664
Come here, big guy!

328
00:12:12,598 --> 00:12:14,500
I want some, too.

329
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:27,480
Everything comfy, Daphne?

330
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,481
Here you are.

331
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:29,982
This quiche should hold you
till dinner.

332
00:12:29,982 --> 00:12:30,983
Oh, Dr. Crane,

333
00:12:30,983 --> 00:12:32,985
you really don't need
to fill in for me.

334
00:12:32,985 --> 00:12:34,253
It's just
a sprained wrist.

335
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:35,988
I'm perfectly capable
of cooking dinner.

336
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:37,656
The hell you are.

337
00:12:37,656 --> 00:12:39,925
Daphne, it is the least
I can do, believe me.

338
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:41,727
Until you're
fully recovered,

339
00:12:41,727 --> 00:12:43,829
consider me
your full-time stand-in.

340
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:46,098
Uh... oh,
which reminds me, Dad,

341
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:48,100
I rented
your favorite video.

342
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,469
(laughing):
Death Wish.

343
00:12:51,837 --> 00:12:53,272
Oh, I'll get your beer.

344
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:55,274
I'm just frosting the mug
in the freezer

345
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:56,108
the way Daphne does.

346
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,476
I never frost
your beer mug.

347
00:12:57,476 --> 00:12:59,445
Oh, be quiet,
will you?

348
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,447
He's feeling very guilty,

349
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,849
and we have to help him work
through it.

350
00:13:03,849 --> 00:13:05,751
That is just baloney
and you know it.

351
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:07,753
Shame on you,
taking advantage of your son.

352
00:13:07,753 --> 00:13:09,522
I don't know how you sleep
at night.

353
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:10,790
Well, pretty good
since he started putting

354
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,626
a mint on my pillow
and a cup of cocoa by the bed.

355
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:16,295
He never
leaves me cocoa.

356
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:18,430
You have to fill out
that little card.

357
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:19,331
Oh.

358
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:23,869
MARTIN:
Oh, Fras.

359
00:13:23,869 --> 00:13:25,571
How'd the show go?

360
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:32,745
It was very educational.

361
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:37,750
Today, Mary taught us
how to manipulate our husbands

362
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,752
by withholding sex.

363
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,521
And she taught us

364
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:45,391
how to lie to our children
about the past.

365
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:48,227
Boy, that Dr. Mary
sure goes on and on.

366
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:49,562
For the last time...

367
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:51,597
she is not a doctor
no matter how many times

368
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:52,598
she refers to herself as one.

369
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:54,600
A cat can have kittens
in the oven

370
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,102
but that don't
make 'em biscuits!

371
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:07,179
Dear...God,
now I'm quoting Grandpa Willie.

372
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:08,681
For heaven's
sake, Frasier,

373
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:09,682
why don't you
just talk to her?

374
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,650
Well, it's a delicate
situation, Niles,

375
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:13,185
for God's sake.

376
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:14,687
I mean,
it's not all that easy.

377
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,689
I mean, she is new to the field,
she's sensitive,

378
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:18,190
she's-she's eager
to please...

379
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:19,592
She's black.

380
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:21,460
Dad, please!

381
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,729
You know damn well that's what
this whole thing's about.

382
00:14:23,729 --> 00:14:25,030
I don't know
what the big deal is.

383
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:25,998
If she's talking too much,

384
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:28,367
just tell her
to shut her big bazoo.

385
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:29,735
Oh, really, and how do you
suggest I accomplish that

386
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:31,136
without sounding like
a complete bigot?

387
00:14:31,136 --> 00:14:33,038
Well, perhaps a little
diplomacy is in order.

388
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:35,040
Oh, are you saying
I should just choose my words

389
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,542
more carefully, is that it?
Yeah, exactly.

390
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:37,977
Oh, fine, fine.

391
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:39,879
All right, Niles,
just exactly how would that go?

392
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,680
Why don't you play me
and I'll be Mary?

393
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,649
All right, uh, Mary...

394
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:45,985
Frasier.

395
00:14:47,753 --> 00:14:49,788
I-I've been meaning
to speak to you.

396
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:52,258
Uh, you know, people listen
to the show for my expertise.

397
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:55,027
Oh, so, my opinion's
not worth anything?

398
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:56,795
Well, I'm the one
with the medical degree.

399
00:14:56,795 --> 00:14:58,297
All right, now,
I want you to contribute

400
00:14:58,297 --> 00:14:59,565
but only up to a point.

401
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:02,334
So you want me to stay
in my place... massa.

402
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:10,175
She's not going to say "massa."

403
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:12,645
What, am I getting too uppity
for you... you sherry-swillin',

404
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:14,647
opera-lovin',
Armani-wearin' elitist.

405
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:16,615
You have no idea
how difficult it is

406
00:15:16,615 --> 00:15:20,552
for a black woman
in a white man's world.

407
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:24,056
Frasier...

408
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:25,491
I don't think so!

409
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:30,396
Look at me.
This is ridiculous.

410
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:33,732
I have walked myself
straight into a minefield!

411
00:15:33,732 --> 00:15:36,068
Listen, Frasier,

412
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:38,037
I know you're trying
to be sensitive,

413
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:40,072
but you're not showing
this woman any respect

414
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:41,573
if you're not
as honest with her

415
00:15:41,573 --> 00:15:43,075
as you would be
with someone else.

416
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:44,543
Right.
This is your show.

417
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:46,045
When she gets her own show,

418
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:47,479
she can say
whatever she wants.

419
00:15:49,915 --> 00:15:50,849
Wait a minute.

420
00:15:50,849 --> 00:15:51,884
You know what, Dad?

421
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:53,419
You may be on to something,
there.

422
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:55,854
Gosh, I don't know why
I didn't think of that myself.

423
00:15:55,854 --> 00:15:57,356
You know what?
I'm just gonna call Kenny

424
00:15:57,356 --> 00:15:58,357
and tell him to give her
her own show.

425
00:15:58,357 --> 00:15:59,858
They're looking
for a replacement

426
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:01,160
for Let's Go Camping
with Dan and Jenna.

427
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:01,961
What happened to them?

428
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,862
They don't know.

429
00:16:03,862 --> 00:16:06,098
Kenny, it's Frasier.

430
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:07,366
Listen, I've been thinking.

431
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:08,367
You know what?

432
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:09,868
I-I think I'm holding Mary back.

433
00:16:09,868 --> 00:16:12,171
Yes, I mean, you know,
a talent like hers

434
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:14,239
should not be stuck
in a producer's chair.

435
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:16,575
He agrees with me.

436
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:18,577
Oh, I'll tell you
what you do.

437
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:19,578
You snap out of it.

438
00:16:19,578 --> 00:16:21,947
You know why you're afraid
to get married?

439
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:24,783
You think there's some roomful
of hootchie-mamas out there

440
00:16:24,783 --> 00:16:26,318
just waiting for you

441
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:27,319
in case you don't want
to do the right thing.

442
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:28,320
Let me tell you something,

443
00:16:28,787 --> 00:16:30,322
the only thing
you're missing out on is

444
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:31,824
a lot of cold
and lonely nights,

445
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,826
and I tell you what,
there's not one person out there

446
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,594
that will disagree with me
on that.

447
00:16:35,594 --> 00:16:37,396
Ido.

448
00:16:40,265 --> 00:16:42,101
I don't think he deserves
that girl,

449
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:44,603
and if he's not man enough
to take that leap of faith,

450
00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:46,472
then she's better off
without him.

451
00:16:46,472 --> 00:16:47,806
Louise,
is you trippin'?

452
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:50,109
"Trippin'"?
Girl, they've been together
for 14 years.

453
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:51,443
They got four kids.

454
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:53,445
You got to get married.
(Louise arguing)

455
00:16:53,445 --> 00:16:54,947
He needs
to do the right thing.

456
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:56,448
What are you trying
to tell that man?

457
00:16:56,915 --> 00:16:58,217
You ain't
never been married.

458
00:16:58,217 --> 00:16:59,985
Oh, no. Oh, no.
Hello,
I'm Dr. Mary.

459
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:01,920
Hello. I'm not
trying to hear you.
I don't see a Dr. Louise...

460
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:08,827
Hello.

461
00:17:08,827 --> 00:17:09,828
(grunts)

462
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:10,829
Hi, Roz.

463
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:12,331
Hey, Frasier.

464
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:14,833
Listened to your show for
about 20 minutes today.

465
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,235
I didn't even
hear your voice.

466
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:19,438
Well, I'm playing
a diminished role these days,

467
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:21,173
although, still,
an important one.

468
00:17:21,173 --> 00:17:25,544
I am the glue
that... holds the show together,

469
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:28,047
or as Mary said in her intro...

470
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:31,550
"The filling
in our little Oreo."

471
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:37,756
Well, it's no picnic
working with Gil, either.

472
00:17:37,756 --> 00:17:39,591
You know that little joke
he makes before every show

473
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:41,593
that his taste buds are insured?

474
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:42,461
Mmm.
They really are.

475
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:44,229
Oh.

476
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:46,098
Guess who had
to take the claims photo

477
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:47,966
after he ate a hot slice
of pizza?

478
00:17:47,966 --> 00:17:49,268
Oh... God, Roz,

479
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:50,269
I'm so sorry.

480
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:51,770
You should be.

481
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:53,772
Go away for a week and you
give away our whole show.

482
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:55,074
Yes, I know...

483
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,708
Oh, Lord,
there she is.

484
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:59,144
You know what? I could've nipped
this whole thing in the bud

485
00:17:59,144 --> 00:18:01,613
if I'd just been honest with her
from the beginning.

486
00:18:01,613 --> 00:18:03,115
You know what?

487
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:05,584
Perhaps the time has come for me
to just tell her the truth.

488
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:08,087
Well... sounds like an
intense conversation.

489
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,588
Think I'll get
out of here

490
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,056
and give you
a little room.

491
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:12,024
Thank you, Roz.

492
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:14,460
Roz...

493
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:18,530
MARY:
Hey there, partner.

494
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:21,033
Is there room for one more
at the doctors' table?

495
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:22,534
(chuckling):
Of course, Mary.

496
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:25,537
Listen, th-there's something
I-I want to talk to you about.

497
00:18:25,537 --> 00:18:26,872
Oh, I don't
doubt it.
Uh...

498
00:18:26,872 --> 00:18:28,173
Could you believe
Louise today?

499
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:30,442
She just would not stop
talking, would she?

500
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:32,678
Well, it's not Louise...
Every time I
turned around,

501
00:18:32,678 --> 00:18:34,613
she was just yappity-
yappity-yappity-yap.

502
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:36,148
I mean, what is her
training anyway?

503
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:38,150
Mary, please, just stop it,
stop it, please.

504
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:41,620
The problem is not with Louise.

505
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,489
It's with you.

506
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:45,290
What?

507
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:49,595
Look, the truth is I...
I don't enjoy working with you.

508
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:52,798
I haven't enjoyed working
with you from the start.

509
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,199
We have different styles,

510
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:56,201
and I-I have
absolutely no respect

511
00:18:56,201 --> 00:18:57,703
for the advice
that you give.

512
00:18:57,703 --> 00:19:00,706
I-I had no idea.

513
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:04,209
Well, why didn't you just
say something before?

514
00:19:06,211 --> 00:19:09,114
Well, it's because you're black.

515
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:11,483
And...

516
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:13,986
the truth is I-I'm...
I was afraid that if I...

517
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,487
if I said something
critical of you,

518
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:18,490
you... you might react
the wrong way,

519
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:21,860
and... I feel just terrible
about it.

520
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,730
Well, maybe you shouldn't
feel so bad, be...

521
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,598
No, no, actually,
I should.

522
00:19:26,598 --> 00:19:28,433
You see, I pride myself
in being able to communicate

523
00:19:28,433 --> 00:19:29,434
with just about anybody,

524
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:30,836
and I couldn't even
be honest with you.

525
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,237
Oh, it's not that easy.

526
00:19:32,237 --> 00:19:33,739
You didn't want
to disappoint me.

527
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:35,073
I understand.

528
00:19:35,073 --> 00:19:36,408
If you don't like the show

529
00:19:36,408 --> 00:19:39,178
the way it is right now
then that comes first.

530
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,947
Like Grandpa Willie
used to say

531
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:46,385
"If the shoe don't fit,
then that ain't your shoe."

532
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:50,289
You know, as much as I've come
to loathe Grandpa Willie,

533
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:52,257
that does actually
make me feel a little better.

534
00:19:52,257 --> 00:19:53,725
(chuckles)

535
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:56,228
I'll let you in
on a little secret.

536
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:59,531
All those expressions...
I made them up myself.

537
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:01,166
(laughing)

538
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:03,135
I'll give you
another reason

539
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:05,437
not to feel so bad
about all this.

540
00:20:05,437 --> 00:20:08,273
Today, KPXY offered me
my own show.

541
00:20:08,273 --> 00:20:10,275
I'm going to be just fine
on my own.

542
00:20:10,275 --> 00:20:12,544
Mary, th-that's
wonderful news.

543
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:16,248
So, you...
you forgive me?

544
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:19,585
Well, I think you could've
been honest with me.

545
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:21,853
Then again, if you
told me to be quiet,

546
00:20:21,853 --> 00:20:23,689
then I'd be back
at the bakery.

547
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:26,191
Instead, I've got
this brand-new career,

548
00:20:26,191 --> 00:20:28,594
and this afternoon,
I'm shopping for cars.

549
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:30,929
So, I guess what
I'm saying is...

550
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:33,832
God bless your guilty
white ass, okay?

551
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:34,800
(laughing)

552
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:42,207
So...

553
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:44,076
How'd it go?
Well, actually, uh...

554
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,544
better than I expected.

555
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:46,545
(chuckles)

556
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:48,013
I guess
we're a team again, Roz.

557
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:49,982
Great. We'll have to
wait a little while.

558
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:51,483
I mean, I got to
stay with Gil

559
00:20:51,483 --> 00:20:53,285
at least until we
find a replacement.

560
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:54,620
Oh, right, of course.

561
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,622
Well, I-I can
find somebody.

562
00:20:57,789 --> 00:21:00,359
Thank you for your call, Jill.

563
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:03,295
Well, Chuck,
who else is on the line?

564
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:05,230
Weww, Dr. Cwane...

565
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:08,233
we have Winda
on wine fwee

566
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:12,471
who bewieves peopew
awe waffing at hew.

567
00:21:17,075 --> 00:21:20,412
Maybe we can just come
back to that one, Chuck.

568
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:21,413
