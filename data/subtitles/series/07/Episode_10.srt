1
00:00:08,875 --> 00:00:09,876
Daphne.

2
00:00:09,876 --> 00:00:10,944
Hey.
Hello.

3
00:00:10,944 --> 00:00:13,313
I though you were spending
the afternoon with Dad.

4
00:00:13,313 --> 00:00:15,148
He's in the loo.
Why don't you join us?

5
00:00:15,148 --> 00:00:16,082
All right.
Thank you.

6
00:00:16,082 --> 00:00:17,450
Hey, did you happen
to catch the show today?

7
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:19,986
I was on fire. First caller
was an agoraphobic--

8
00:00:19,986 --> 00:00:21,955
boom! Knocked it
right out of the park.

9
00:00:21,955 --> 00:00:23,957
Then two troubled marriages
and a compulsive overeater--

10
00:00:23,957 --> 00:00:26,960
boom, boom! Boom!

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,929
I was a regular mental health
dispensing machine.

12
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:31,965
I did two loads of laundry

13
00:00:31,965 --> 00:00:34,434
and cut a piece of gum
out of Eddie's hair.

14
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:35,835
Now, Daphne, don't
get down on yourself.

15
00:00:35,835 --> 00:00:37,404
The work you do at home
is very important.

16
00:00:37,404 --> 00:00:38,405
In fact, I don't know what

17
00:00:38,405 --> 00:00:40,206
Dad and I are going to do
once you're married.

18
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:41,474
Thank you, Dr. Crane.

19
00:00:41,474 --> 00:00:42,475
That makes me feel better.

20
00:00:42,475 --> 00:00:46,813
Boom! Boy, there is
no "off" switch on this thing.

21
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:48,615
Sadly, that's true.

22
00:00:48,615 --> 00:00:51,051
Oh, there she is,
the other half of our team.

23
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,053
Roz, are you still
as jazzed as I am?

24
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:54,921
They're taking us
off the air.

25
00:00:54,921 --> 00:00:57,057
What? Since when?

26
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,592
While you were looking for
Gatorade to pour over yourself,

27
00:00:59,592 --> 00:01:01,694
Kenny came by and
said he's yanking
us for a week.

28
00:01:01,694 --> 00:01:02,962
He wants to try out
that new show--

29
00:01:02,962 --> 00:01:05,465
you know,Car Chat
with Bob and Bethany.

30
00:01:05,465 --> 00:01:07,400
Car Chat with Bob and Bethany?

31
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,902
What the...?

32
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:12,238
Oh... touche, Kenny.

33
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:13,840
You are indeed

34
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,608
a worthy adversary,

35
00:01:15,608 --> 00:01:19,913
but you shall find I have
a trick or two of my own.

36
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:21,147
You know,
Dr. Crane,

37
00:01:21,147 --> 00:01:22,615
maybe a week off
would do you some good.

38
00:01:22,615 --> 00:01:23,650
No, no, no,
you don't understand.

39
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:25,051
You see, I'm actually

40
00:01:25,051 --> 00:01:26,119
renegotiating
my contract right now

41
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:27,620
and this is merely
the station's tactic

42
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,022
to try to get me to cave.

43
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:30,390
I hope you're right.

44
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:31,958
Of course I'm right.

45
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:33,927
Bob and Bethany,Car Chat.
Please.

46
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:35,862
How can anybody drone on
for three hours

47
00:01:35,862 --> 00:01:37,864
about a subject
that nobody even understands?

48
00:01:37,864 --> 00:01:39,833
Yeah, we were there first.

49
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:41,267
Don't worry,
Dr. Crane.

50
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:44,337
I'm sure you're right
about these things.

51
00:01:44,337 --> 00:01:45,805
After all, you
usually are.

52
00:01:45,805 --> 00:01:47,307
Why, thank you, Daphne.

53
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:48,641
That's exactly
what I needed to hear.

54
00:01:48,641 --> 00:01:50,276
Boom.

55
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:51,444
(laughing)

56
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:52,846
Son.
Oh, hi, Dad.

57
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:55,915
Boy, they really did a job
in the men's room, didn't they?

58
00:01:55,915 --> 00:01:56,883
Why, I hadn't noticed.

59
00:01:57,417 --> 00:01:58,918
Oh, yeah,
completely redid it.

60
00:01:58,918 --> 00:02:00,386
Fancy wallpapers,

61
00:02:00,386 --> 00:02:02,789
bright new tile,
even those little perfumed soaps

62
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,324
that you like to use
at home, Fras.

63
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:05,692
DAPHNE:
Oh, for heaven's sakes.

64
00:02:05,692 --> 00:02:09,462
You went into the ladies room,
you blind old sod.

65
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:13,266
I've been begging him
for months to get glasses.

66
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:15,702
Ladies room? You're crazy.
That guy was just in there.

67
00:02:17,937 --> 00:02:19,772
Oh, hi, Bethany.
Uh, listen.

68
00:02:19,772 --> 00:02:21,541
Good luck in the slot next week.

69
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:23,376
BETHANY:
Thanks. We're pumped.

70
00:02:25,178 --> 00:02:27,480
Granted, Dad, Bethany
may be a bit of a tough call,

71
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,250
but still, you know, it wouldn't
hurt to get a checkup.

72
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,018
Oh, come on,
don't you start, too.

73
00:02:32,018 --> 00:02:33,520
There's nothing
wrong with my eyes.

74
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,522
Now, if you don't mind,
I just want

75
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:37,023
to sit here quietly,
and have an...

76
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:40,760
...have a drink of cream.

77
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,029
Do you have a problem with that?

78
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:51,504
Hello, Dr. Crane.

79
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,907
Oh. Hello, Daphne.

80
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:57,410
Say, you know, my agent Bebe
said she might be stopping by.

81
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:58,912
Have you heard anything?

82
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:00,780
No. And I hope she's
not staying for lunch.

83
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,950
I'm afraid we're
fresh out of live mice.

84
00:03:10,056 --> 00:03:12,392
Hey, Fras.

85
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:13,193
Dad.

86
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:23,970
Is it my imagination,
or are those ladies glasses?

87
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:26,406
Yes, and don't you
say anything.

88
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:28,408
I had to drag him
down to the store.

89
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:29,909
He tried on every pair
in the place.

90
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:31,811
Those were
the only ones he liked.

91
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:41,588
So.

92
00:03:41,588 --> 00:03:44,924
How do you like the new specs?

93
00:03:44,924 --> 00:03:46,859
They certainly
are eye-catching.

94
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:48,194
Yeah.

95
00:03:48,194 --> 00:03:50,430
You should have seen the looks
I got all day.

96
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,298
Mostly from women.

97
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:54,234
You know, I'd like
to think it was me,

98
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,236
but I got an idea
these frames were designed

99
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:59,672
with an eye
to pleasing the ladies.

100
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:01,574
I'd say that's
a safe assumption.

101
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:02,976
Daph, have
you seen

102
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:03,910
the case for them?

103
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,812
I don't know what I did with it.

104
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:07,714
Yeah, I think
I popped them into my purse.

105
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:08,715
Check my room.
Okeydoke.

106
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:10,717
Oh, wait'll you see
this case, Fras.

107
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:14,587
This Lauren guy really knows
what he's doing.

108
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:15,755
Ralph Lauren?

109
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,457
Sophia.

110
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:23,029
I'm amazed you can keep
a straight face all day.

111
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:24,530
(doorbell ringing)

112
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:27,033
I've done enough clothes
shopping with your father.

113
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:29,535
I'm pretty good
at pretending to like things

114
00:04:29,535 --> 00:04:32,038
no matter how horrifying
I find them.

115
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:33,373
Bebe.

116
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:35,708
How nice to see you.

117
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,712
Frasier, my favorite client.

118
00:04:39,712 --> 00:04:42,715
Seattle's golden-throated gift
to the airwaves.

119
00:04:42,715 --> 00:04:45,585
I take it negotiations
aren't going so well.

120
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:47,053
You remember
that insulting figure

121
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:48,054
you said
you'd never accept?

122
00:04:48,554 --> 00:04:49,555
They haven't
come up to it yet.

123
00:04:49,555 --> 00:04:50,490
Oh, dear.

124
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,191
NILES:
Knock, knock.

125
00:04:52,191 --> 00:04:53,826
Oh, come on
in, Niles.

126
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:55,128
Bebe's just bringing
me up to speed

127
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,630
on the depressing news about
my contract negotiations.

128
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,132
Don't worry, dear.

129
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,534
I just need to find a way
to throw a scare into them.

130
00:05:01,534 --> 00:05:04,737
Have you tried
turning into a bat?

131
00:05:04,737 --> 00:05:07,006
I would, love,
but most grown men

132
00:05:07,006 --> 00:05:09,976
don't share your fear
of tiny creatures.

133
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:15,748
Could you two
please catch up later?

134
00:05:15,748 --> 00:05:17,183
I did get one offer

135
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:20,219
that I thought
might give us some leverage.

136
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:21,621
It's a TV job.

137
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:22,522
Television?

138
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:23,956
Unfortunately,
it's all wrong for you.

139
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:27,226
They want you and Roz to host
A.M. Seattle next week.

140
00:05:27,226 --> 00:05:29,028
That vapid morning chat show?

141
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:30,563
Exactly
what I told them.

142
00:05:30,563 --> 00:05:32,565
Frasier Crane is a doctor.

143
00:05:32,565 --> 00:05:35,068
He heals the masses;
he doesn't pander to them.

144
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:36,536
He's not going to do some

145
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:37,870
silly morning
kaffeeklatsch

146
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,872
no matter how
fabulously popular it is.

147
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:41,240
Well, that's
quite right, Bebe.

148
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,942
That sort of show is beneath me.

149
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:43,810
Exactly.

150
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,078
It's undignified.
Horribly.

151
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:45,845
Still...

152
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,814
I'm listening.

153
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:49,248
If there were a way to do it

154
00:05:49,248 --> 00:05:51,184
with a bit more dignity,
some polish and substance.

155
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,518
Why didn't I think of that?

156
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:55,788
You know, a dash of high society
and a dollop of culture.

157
00:05:55,788 --> 00:05:58,491
I can't believe
you're even considering this.

158
00:05:58,491 --> 00:05:59,559
The show
is nothing more

159
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:00,827
than a melange of bad jokes

160
00:06:01,327 --> 00:06:02,628
and mind-numbing banter.

161
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:04,430
Yes, but it doesn't have to be,
Niles, don't you see?

162
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,265
If I could choose
the guests myself.

163
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:07,500
You can.
And control the content.

164
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,835
You could.
Well, then I'd accept.

165
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:10,570
We did. I mean, we will.

166
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:13,373
In fact, why don't I call

167
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:16,743
them right now
with the exciting news.

168
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:17,710
(chuckling)

169
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,178
May I?

170
00:06:19,178 --> 00:06:20,947
On the balcony,
if you don't mind.

171
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:21,848
Mind?

172
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:24,350
I don't want a single puff

173
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:27,353
tearing up the baby blues
of TV's newest sensation.

174
00:06:27,353 --> 00:06:29,088
By this time next week...
You heard him--

175
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:32,458
If you're going to blow smoke,
do it on the balcony.

176
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:39,065
Well, I can't say
I'm surprised.

177
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,933
What is that supposed to mean?

178
00:06:40,933 --> 00:06:42,902
Only that something like this
was inevitable.

179
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,404
It's the final step
in your descent

180
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:47,840
from legitimate psychiatrist
to dancing bear.

181
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,242
Niles, we are
talking about doing

182
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:51,778
a sophisticated television show
for one week

183
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:54,046
in order to improve
my contract negotiations.

184
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:56,315
This has nothing to do with
your contract negotiations.

185
00:06:56,315 --> 00:06:57,817
You have been an applause junkie

186
00:06:57,817 --> 00:07:00,186
ever since you first set foot
on a grammar school stage.

187
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:02,088
I was drawn to the theater

188
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:04,991
because of its discipline
and collaborative spirit.

189
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:06,392
Oh, please.

190
00:07:06,392 --> 00:07:08,928
In your sixth-grade production
of Oklahoma,

191
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:11,931
you took so many curtain calls,
Mrs. Van Raaphorst

192
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:14,801
had to lasso you
and pull you from the stage.

193
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:17,136
That woman never understood
me or the role

194
00:07:17,136 --> 00:07:19,439
of farmer number three.

195
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:24,177
Oh, I'm just wasting my breath.

196
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:26,045
As usual, you have fallen
under the spell

197
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:27,013
of that sorceress
out there.

198
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:28,514
I have done
no such thing.

199
00:07:28,514 --> 00:07:30,049
And I wish you'd
just lay off of Bebe.

200
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:31,050
She is not some
malign witch

201
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,485
who can transform
people at will.

202
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:35,922
I can't find a damn thing
in this purse.

203
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:42,829
If I say I'm sorry,

204
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:45,832
will she change Dad
back into a man?

205
00:07:49,268 --> 00:07:50,837
Well, it took several
of your best people,

206
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:52,338
but I believe
they've finally wrestled

207
00:07:52,338 --> 00:07:54,340
this feisty cowlick
of mine into submission.

208
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,776
So, are we, uh, ready to roll?

209
00:07:56,776 --> 00:07:59,011
Not quite.
Your partner's not here.

210
00:07:59,011 --> 00:08:00,279
Roz is not here?

211
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:02,248
But we are on in four minutes.

212
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:04,183
At this point,
a rerun is on in four minutes.

213
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:05,451
Don't worry, Matt,
she'll be here.

214
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:07,086
We won't have time
to put her through makeup.

215
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:08,454
A natural beauty like Roz?

216
00:08:08,454 --> 00:08:09,956
Oh, please, darling.

217
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:11,891
Pinch her cheek, stand back
and watch her glow.

218
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:13,793
Hey. Sorry I'm late.
Roz.

219
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:15,695
Oh, for God's sake,
you look awful.

220
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:17,663
Are you sick?
No. Of course not.

221
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,664
I wouldn't be sick
for our big debut.

222
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:20,099
I'm totally fine.

223
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:21,334
Roz, you're burning up.

224
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,668
Well, it's kind of hot in here.

225
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:24,170
Maybe it's all these lights.

226
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,671
I'll just get this jacket off.

227
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:27,607
No, no. Roz, Roz.
Stop, stop, stop.

228
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:29,008
She's delirious.

229
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:31,511
With anticipation,
darling. Don't worry.

230
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,512
I'll calm her down.

231
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,013
Pull yourself together,

232
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,481
you hear me,
we need this show!

233
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:36,949
All right, everyone
we're doing a rerun.

234
00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:38,684
Let the audience go,
cue the tapes.

235
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,887
Wait. Can't Frasier
do the show without her?

236
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:42,221
This is a chat show.

237
00:08:42,221 --> 00:08:43,623
Who's he going to chat with?

238
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:45,057
Me. I'll go on with him.

239
00:08:45,057 --> 00:08:45,958
You?

240
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:48,728
Pull yourself
together, Roz!

241
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:50,062
I don't think so, Bebe.

242
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:51,464
Why not? All he
needs is someone

243
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:53,866
to suck up to him,
laugh at his jokes,

244
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,368
pretend to listen
to his stories.

245
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:58,304
I'm his agent;
for God's sake,
that's what I do.

246
00:08:58,304 --> 00:09:00,573
You know, I believe
she could pull it off.

247
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:02,241
The problem is,
she needs to be likable.

248
00:09:02,241 --> 00:09:05,044
Right. Do I at least
get to keep the suit?

249
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,313
Hold on.

250
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:08,614
I can be likable.

251
00:09:08,614 --> 00:09:10,950
I can also be very unlikable.

252
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,251
Maybe if you explained
the difference

253
00:09:12,251 --> 00:09:13,219
to poor, confused Bebe.

254
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,254
For instance, what you were
doing in the dressing room

255
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:17,189
with the wardrobe girl
an hour ago--

256
00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:21,093
would your wife find that
likable or unlikable?

257
00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:23,663
Could you put some makeup
on this woman now?

258
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:25,565
Okay, folks.
60 seconds.

259
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,066
All right, Bebe,
just follow my lead.

260
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:30,570
I'll introduce us and then we'll
get to our guests, all right?

261
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,572
Now, wasn't our first guest
Susan Sontag?

262
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:33,839
Oh, she had a conflict.

263
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,875
Don't worry.
We got a fabulous replacement.

264
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:39,679
"Baby Leo, the world's biggest
two-year-old"?

265
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:41,614
You're going to love him.

266
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:43,616
Just remember
to lift with your legs.

267
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:46,485
That's it. This
is unacceptable.

268
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:49,155
Oh, now who's
the world's biggest baby?

269
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:50,523
I will not do this show!
We're live in five,

270
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:53,526
four, three, two...

271
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:55,027
(theme music plays)

272
00:09:55,027 --> 00:09:57,530
Hi. Welcome
to A.M. Seattle.

273
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,532
I'm Dr. Frasier Crane.

274
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:00,533
And I'm Bebe Glazer.

275
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:01,500
We're going to be
your hosts this week

276
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,535
and believe me,
we've got

277
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:05,538
some great shows
lined up for you.

278
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:07,039
But before we get
to our guests,

279
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,842
I'd like to take a few
moments to share with you

280
00:10:09,842 --> 00:10:12,545
a few thoughts
I've prepared

281
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:14,680
on a very special
time of the day--

282
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,016
the time that we'll be
spending together--

283
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:18,417
Morning.

284
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:20,920
A new beginning.

285
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,322
A daily rebirth,
if you will.

286
00:10:23,322 --> 00:10:24,724
What the hell is this?

287
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:26,125
Banter. Banter.

288
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,160
And even though
"A.M." stands for

289
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,562
"ante meridian,"

290
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:31,464
if you simply put them together,

291
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:35,835
they also make up the word "am,"
as in, "I am."

292
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:37,136
Whoa.

293
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:41,273
Not before my coffee.

294
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:45,645
As you can see, Frasier
has a way with words

295
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:49,448
but did you also know
that he has a way with voices?

296
00:10:49,448 --> 00:10:50,716
Excuse me?

297
00:10:50,716 --> 00:10:52,084
Who wants to hear Frasier's

298
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:54,086
famous Sean Connery impression?

299
00:10:54,086 --> 00:10:57,023
(applause and cheering)

300
00:11:02,628 --> 00:11:04,630
(imitating Sean Connery):
Now, now, Moneypenny,

301
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:06,932
you're embarrassing me.

302
00:11:06,932 --> 00:11:09,201
(laughing)

303
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:15,641
Dr. Frasier Crane,
ladies and gentlemen.

304
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:18,878
Any more impressions, Frasier?

305
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:20,012
Maybe I should just...

306
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:21,347
Now, don't be shy.

307
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:24,350
Who wants to hear Frasier
do more impressions?

308
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,718
(applause and cheering)

309
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,754
It's just that I'd hate

310
00:11:28,754 --> 00:11:30,256
to take time away
from our other guests.

311
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:31,724
I-I believe that...

312
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:35,494
(imitating James Mason):
James Mason may be stopping by
to visit today.

313
00:11:35,494 --> 00:11:37,296
(laughing)

314
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:38,264
Oh, yes!

315
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,210
This has been
some week.

316
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,211
It's really flown by.

317
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:53,546
Hasn't it?

318
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:54,447
Whoosh.

319
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:55,448
A whoosh.

320
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:56,949
I can't believe
it's time

321
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:57,950
for Thursday's
Kitchen Corner.

322
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:01,420
We'll be right back
with Chef Frasier.

323
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,723
Hang tight.

324
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,524
STAGE MANAGER:
And we're clear.

325
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:08,694
Bebe, Kitchen Corner?

326
00:12:08,694 --> 00:12:11,197
I thought we had
the violin prodigy up next.

327
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:13,532
For God's sake, we bumped
Kim Lee twice this week.

328
00:12:13,532 --> 00:12:14,834
I know, but we're running
short of time,

329
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:17,103
and the cooking segment
is gonna be boffo.

330
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:18,838
Well, all right, but I insist

331
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:20,239
Kim Lee play over
the closing credits.

332
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,741
All right?
We're not running

333
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,743
some sort of a tacky run-
of-the-mill morning show.

334
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,244
Here's your
chef's costume.
Thank you.

335
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:27,246
Allow me, dear.

336
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:31,050
You know, Frasier.
Hmm?

337
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,351
The most magical thing
happened to me

338
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:33,853
last night during dinner.

339
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:34,854
Really?

340
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:36,322
I was recognized.

341
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:38,724
It's intoxicating,
isn't it?

342
00:12:38,724 --> 00:12:40,926
Gosh, I myself,

343
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:42,194
no stranger
to celebrity,

344
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:43,696
have noticed
more heads

345
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:44,697
swiveling
in my direction.

346
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:45,698
Ooh.

347
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:46,665
(chuckles)

348
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:50,202
STAGE MANAGER:
We're back
in five, four,

349
00:12:50,202 --> 00:12:51,604
three, two...

350
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:52,471
Welcome back.

351
00:12:52,471 --> 00:12:54,473
Frasier, I hear you're
quite the gourmet.

352
00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:55,474
Oh, please.

353
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:56,909
I don't do
anything fancy.

354
00:12:56,909 --> 00:12:59,478
A few souffles,
a flambe or two.

355
00:12:59,478 --> 00:13:00,980
Just good eats.

356
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,982
Now, this morning,
I'm going to be making

357
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:04,483
my signature
breakfast for you--

358
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:06,318
that's Eggs
Palermo Fontana.

359
00:13:06,318 --> 00:13:08,120
Mmm. Makes
my mouth water.

360
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,122
But before we start,

361
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:11,624
I have a little
sweetheart backstage

362
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,626
who's dying to come out
and give you a hand.

363
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,127
Is it Kim Lee?

364
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:16,128
Not even close.

365
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:18,464
It's Bobo,
the cooking chimp.

366
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:24,236
Oh, that's very funny.

367
00:13:24,236 --> 00:13:27,573
This has Matt's
fingerprints
all over it.

368
00:13:28,874 --> 00:13:29,809
We thought

369
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:30,776
it might be great fun

370
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:32,711
if you were to match
your skills against his.

371
00:13:32,711 --> 00:13:35,181
FRASIER:
Well, I don't know,
Bebe, uh...

372
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:37,116
Well, let's let
the audience decide.

373
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:38,117
How many of you

374
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:39,618
want to see the
monkey make eggs?

375
00:13:39,618 --> 00:13:41,086
(applause)

376
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:44,123
How many of you want
to see Bobo make eggs?

377
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:45,591
Oh.

378
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:46,592
Just kidding.

379
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:47,626
Ouch.

380
00:13:47,626 --> 00:13:48,594
Well, all right.

381
00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:51,096
Apes before beauty.

382
00:13:51,096 --> 00:13:52,598
(chuckles)

383
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:55,234
Frasier.

384
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:56,235
Bobo.

385
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:58,504
May the best chef win.

386
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:00,239
FRASIER:
Now, the first rule
of haute cuisine

387
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:02,208
is to be sure you have
all your ingredients

388
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:03,209
at hand, you see.

389
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:05,477
We have eggs, milk, butter,

390
00:14:05,477 --> 00:14:09,315
spinach, and, of course,
our old friend, the shallot.

391
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:10,583
(egg cracking)

392
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,320
Why, look at that.

393
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,322
He's not even
preheating the pan.

394
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:17,656
The beast.

395
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:19,959
Bobo's getting
an early lead.

396
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:20,960
Yeah.

397
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,461
It's very important

398
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:24,730
to keep your eggs
light and fluffy.

399
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,498
So, what you want to do

400
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:31,003
is add a bit of milk
and a touch of flour.

401
00:14:34,573 --> 00:14:36,208
(Bebe yells)

402
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,810
Stop that.

403
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,211
(laughing)
Well, I...

404
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:42,514
Oh, he's a pesky
little chef, isn't he?

405
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:44,216
(Bebe laughing)

406
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:47,086
Oh, you crazy chimp.

407
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:54,193
Oh. Oh, my God.

408
00:14:54,193 --> 00:14:56,295
And this whole thing
was improvised.

409
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:57,563
DAPHNE:
You're kidding.

410
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,031
It's like you
and the chimp

411
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:01,901
have been working
together for years.

412
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,602
Boy, that's great stuff,
Frasier.

413
00:15:03,602 --> 00:15:05,471
You know, I can't
tell you how impressed

414
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,472
the guys at McGinty's

415
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:07,973
are that I have
such a famous son.

416
00:15:07,973 --> 00:15:09,241
What do
they say?

417
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:11,010
Well, they don't say anything
to my face,

418
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:12,011
but when I walk in,

419
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:15,014
they kind of nudge
each other and whisper.

420
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:16,882
Oh.

421
00:15:16,882 --> 00:15:18,284
(timer dings)

422
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:19,551
That will be me
Shepherd's Pie.

423
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,853
Shepherd's Pie?

424
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:24,223
I must confess,
there's a part of me

425
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:26,225
that wishes I could still do
the TV show.

426
00:15:26,725 --> 00:15:27,559
(doorbell rings)

427
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:29,428
Well, there's a part
of me that wishes

428
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:30,896
that monkey was
cooking dinner

429
00:15:30,896 --> 00:15:31,931
instead of you-know-who.

430
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,934
But we put our dreams away.

431
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,936
Oh, hi, Roz.

432
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,237
Well, don't you
look nice.

433
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:39,505
You're feeling better?
Yes, thank you.

434
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:40,940
Uh, can we talk?

435
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:41,941
Of course.
Come on in.

436
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:42,942
What's the matter?

437
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,443
Well, I talked
to my friends

438
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:45,444
in business affairs

439
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,446
and they say they're ready
to close our deals

440
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:48,747
but Bebe's
holding it up.

441
00:15:48,747 --> 00:15:50,049
Of course, she's holding it up.

442
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:51,417
She's trying to
make them sweat a bit.

443
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:52,451
That's the
whole strategy

444
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,486
behind this TV
show-- leverage.

445
00:15:54,486 --> 00:15:55,321
Yeah, well,

446
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:57,189
um, I heard a rumor

447
00:15:57,189 --> 00:16:00,492
that A.M. Seattle isn't happy
with their regular hosts,

448
00:16:00,492 --> 00:16:01,794
and I think
she's angling

449
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,062
for you
to take over.

450
00:16:03,062 --> 00:16:04,330
So where does
that leave me?

451
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:07,199
Well, even if
that was Bebe's plan,

452
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,568
I mean, you're forgetting
that it's still my career,

453
00:16:09,568 --> 00:16:10,569
and I'm calling the shots.

454
00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:13,072
There is no way I would continue
doing A.M. Seattle.

455
00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:15,040
You look like you're having
the time of your life.

456
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:15,975
I'm playing
a character.

457
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,443
There is a big difference

458
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:20,446
between Dr. Frasier Crane,
psychiatrist and Frasier Crane

459
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:22,848
the guy who starts
your morning right.

460
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:25,084
I tell you what.

461
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:26,919
I will speak to Bebe tomorrow
when we're in the chair.

462
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:28,420
That's the industry term

463
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,356
for when we're getting
our makeup put on.

464
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:31,290
Thanks, Frasier.

465
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:32,791
Yeah. Sure.

466
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:35,294
God, this is so weird.

467
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:37,796
Daphne usually has
such great taste.

468
00:16:37,796 --> 00:16:41,100
What is she thinking
with these glasses?

469
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,301
Well, actually,
Roz, uh...

470
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:43,802
I've got to go see

471
00:16:43,802 --> 00:16:45,371
what these
look like.

472
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:46,672
Hi, Roz.
Hey, Martin.

473
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,407
Hey.

474
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:52,811
Somebody ought to tell Mr. Doyle
she's wearing a dude's glasses.

475
00:16:57,983 --> 00:17:01,820
Oh, Kiki,
you're a magician.

476
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,622
Frasier, you're not
going to believe

477
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:05,557
the wonderful news
I just got.

478
00:17:05,557 --> 00:17:07,359
They want us to stay on.

479
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,160
What?
Yes.

480
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,695
We had the
highest ratings

481
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:10,629
the show's had
all year.

482
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:12,498
I don't
believe this.

483
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:13,766
Roz was right.

484
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:15,768
You had no intention
of renegotiating

485
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:16,668
my radio contract.

486
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:20,105
I don't expect
gratitude, Frasier--

487
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:22,107
just a little faith.

488
00:17:22,107 --> 00:17:25,110
I finished your KACL contract
this morning.

489
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:26,078
You did?

490
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:28,580
And I did quite
a good job, I might add.

491
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,082
I'm sorry, Bebe.

492
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:32,384
I owe you
an apology.

493
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:34,653
Wow, this is wonderful.

494
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:37,189
I got an extra
week's vacation,

495
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:38,190
a very handsome raise.

496
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,458
It's garbage
compared to

497
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,226
what they'll give us
to stay on here.

498
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:43,228
You'll get
an expense account,

499
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:44,229
a wardrobe allowance,

500
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:46,065
not to mention
a car and driver.

501
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,399
No, no.

502
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:48,901
Let's not forget
why I took this job.

503
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,803
It was to raise
my profile

504
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:52,704
to get a better deal
with the radio contract.

505
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:56,575
We've done that, Bebe,
and I thank you.

506
00:17:58,977 --> 00:18:01,280
You're welcome, darling.

507
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,582
And I respect
your choice.

508
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,084
Thanks.

509
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,085
Now, let's talk
about today's show.

510
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,086
Right.

511
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,587
We start with
the Friday Fiesta.

512
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:10,923
Here are our costumes.

513
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:13,225
Then we, uh, move on to

514
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:15,727
the Girl Scout
cookie-selling champion.

515
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:18,230
(crying):
Then we...

516
00:18:19,731 --> 00:18:21,600
Bebe, are you
all right?

517
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:25,971
I've spent my life
in the wings.

518
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:27,473
It was just nice

519
00:18:27,473 --> 00:18:30,742
having my moment
in the spotlight.

520
00:18:30,742 --> 00:18:32,010
The rush when

521
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:35,314
that little red light
on the camera turns on.

522
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:37,182
The strip
of masking tape

523
00:18:37,182 --> 00:18:38,684
on my dressing
room door

524
00:18:38,684 --> 00:18:40,185
with my name on it.

525
00:18:40,185 --> 00:18:41,687
The stage-door
Johnnies,

526
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:44,189
or whatever
that strange man

527
00:18:44,189 --> 00:18:46,692
with the autograph
book calls himself.

528
00:18:46,692 --> 00:18:47,693
Admit it, darling,

529
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:49,528
you want this
as much as I do.

530
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:50,362
I saw it in your eyes

531
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:51,797
during the pie
eating contest.

532
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:54,733
Nobody loves
blueberries that much.

533
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:56,735
It's the audience
you love.

534
00:18:56,735 --> 00:18:59,238
MAN:
Are you ready for
Bebe and Frasier?

535
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:01,540
(applause and cheers)

536
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:04,943
Listen to them.

537
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:07,446
They want you.

538
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:09,882
They do want me,
don't they?

539
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:11,884
Tell me to tear up
the contract, Frasier.

540
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:13,752
Maybe it is time
for a change.

541
00:19:13,752 --> 00:19:15,654
Get away from him,
you she-thing!

542
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,556
Niles.

543
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:19,992
It's a good thing Dad
started choking on that peanut

544
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,994
or I'd have never have
come back here for water.

545
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,295
Stop this madness.

546
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:25,030
He can't stop it.
No one can.

547
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,064
Show business
is in his blood.

548
00:19:26,064 --> 00:19:27,399
No, psychiatry is.

549
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:28,534
Frasier, you're a healer.

550
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:29,234
Anyone can heal.

551
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:30,802
You're better than that.

552
00:19:30,802 --> 00:19:32,171
You're an entertainer.

553
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,038
Oh, God, Niles.

554
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:35,040
She's right.

555
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,775
I love the audience.

556
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:37,876
I know
it's shallow,

557
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:39,611
but it makes me
feel alive.

558
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:42,948
Do you have
any idea

559
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:44,917
how ridiculous you
look in this outfit?

560
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:46,318
Frasier,

561
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:49,188
I know I sometimes make light
of your radio show,

562
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:52,191
but the truth is,
you provide help and hope

563
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,693
and comfort to people
who need it.

564
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:56,528
I have always envied you that.

565
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:58,363
Don't listen
to that drivel!

566
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:03,869
He's right, Bebe.

567
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:05,370
I'm a psychiatrist.

568
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:06,772
I can't do
this show anymore.

569
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:09,174
I'm sorry.

570
00:20:09,174 --> 00:20:10,442
Then quit.

571
00:20:10,442 --> 00:20:12,277
Who needs you?

572
00:20:12,277 --> 00:20:14,780
I'll find some other
stuffed shirt

573
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:17,783
who's happy to ride
my coattails to fame.

574
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:19,184
Niles, you're a doctor.

575
00:20:19,184 --> 00:20:20,519
Niles, don't look into her eyes!

576
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:29,995
Well, that's it.

577
00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:35,434
The dream is over.

578
00:20:37,202 --> 00:20:39,004
30 seconds.

579
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:42,908
But I'm still a professional.

580
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:44,943
There's an audience out there

581
00:20:44,943 --> 00:20:48,914
waiting for two people
to ride in on a donkey.

582
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:51,850
I don't know about you...

583
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:57,889
...but I'm not going
to let them down.

584
00:21:02,894 --> 00:21:04,363
It's your last show.

585
00:21:04,863 --> 00:21:05,764
Get out there.

586
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:08,634
Thanks, brother,

587
00:21:08,634 --> 00:21:11,136
for keeping me grounded.

588
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:18,744
Vaya con dios.

589
00:21:18,744 --> 00:21:23,215
