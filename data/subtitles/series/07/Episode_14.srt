1
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:08,942
WOMAN:
What do you see here?

2
00:00:08,942 --> 00:00:10,510
DAPHNE:
It's two bunnies

3
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:14,014
clawing each other to death
over a lima bean.

4
00:00:15,448 --> 00:00:17,884
Forgive me, Dr. McCaskill,

5
00:00:17,884 --> 00:00:19,386
but this game seems rather silly.

6
00:00:19,386 --> 00:00:21,388
I understand how you
might feel that way,

7
00:00:21,388 --> 00:00:23,356
but it's helpful to me.

8
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:24,324
Now, last one.

9
00:00:24,324 --> 00:00:26,793
It's a woman.

10
00:00:26,793 --> 00:00:28,695
Okay, then.

11
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:33,066
She's skinning a pigeon
with a hatchet.

12
00:00:36,436 --> 00:00:38,872
Are we done now?

13
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:41,808
I think we still
have some work to do.

14
00:00:41,808 --> 00:00:43,877
I just don't think
there's any good reason

15
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:45,178
for me to be here.

16
00:00:45,178 --> 00:00:46,946
The judge felt differently.

17
00:00:46,946 --> 00:00:48,314
Oh, what does he know?

18
00:00:48,314 --> 00:00:50,150
Saying I need anger management.

19
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:51,651
I'm not an angry person.

20
00:00:51,651 --> 00:00:53,420
I never have been.

21
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,188
Daphne, wasn't it anger
that led you to cause

22
00:00:55,188 --> 00:00:56,556
that four-car accident?

23
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:59,426
Oh, yes, but I was provoked
into that.

24
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:02,228
Mm-hmm. I'm not angry anymore.

25
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:04,030
Well, there may be a level of emotion

26
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:05,532
you're not entirely in touch with.

27
00:01:05,532 --> 00:01:08,034
Let's talk about your life in general.

28
00:01:08,034 --> 00:01:09,502
You said you had a fiance?

29
00:01:09,502 --> 00:01:11,971
Yes, Donny.

30
00:01:11,971 --> 00:01:13,973
He's a wonderful, generous man.

31
00:01:13,973 --> 00:01:17,477
In fact, he did the sweetest
thing for me last week,

32
00:01:17,477 --> 00:01:18,978
totally out of the blue.

33
00:01:18,978 --> 00:01:21,981
PEOPLE: Surprise!

34
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:25,285
Welcome to your shower,

35
00:01:25,285 --> 00:01:26,920
honey.

36
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,254
Oh, my God, you're trembling.

37
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:32,025
Yes, well, I'm
absolutely blown away.

38
00:01:32,025 --> 00:01:33,259
Oh, come on Daphne.
You were on to us.

39
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:34,828
No, really.

40
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:37,197
You had me completely fooled.

41
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:40,066
We may have an even bigger
surprise for you later on.

42
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:42,001
Oh? Yes, but first things first.

43
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:44,404
Let's get you some champagne.

44
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:46,973
DAPHNE: I'm not usually much
for surprise parties,

45
00:01:46,973 --> 00:01:49,476
but I could see how much trouble
Donny went to.

46
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:52,479
He invited all my friends,
made the food.

47
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,481
He even planned some games.

48
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:57,484
We played this one game
where everyone's in groups,

49
00:01:57,484 --> 00:01:59,486
then each group dresses one person

50
00:01:59,486 --> 00:02:01,488
in a bridal gown made out of toilet paper.

51
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:03,490
Can't remember what it's called.

52
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:05,992
"Toilet Paper Bridal Gown."

53
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:08,495
Yes, that's it. Have you played?

54
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:10,997
I'm familiar with it.

55
00:02:10,997 --> 00:02:12,465
Then, you know, as the bride,

56
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:15,001
I had to judge which group made
the best dress

57
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:17,003
while another woman
was in charge of...

58
00:02:17,003 --> 00:02:18,505
(whistle blows)

59
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:21,975
Time! Stop right now
or be disqualified!

60
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:24,511
Designers, present your brides.

61
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:25,778
Team A.

62
00:02:25,778 --> 00:02:28,414
Ta-da!

63
00:02:28,414 --> 00:02:30,817
Oh, very nice, Donny.

64
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,552
Team B.

65
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:34,354
We're not finished yet.

66
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:35,355
You shouldn't have spent

67
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:37,857
so much time with the sketches.

68
00:02:37,857 --> 00:02:39,125
MEL: Team C.

69
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:40,860
Where's Team C?
Team C, time!

70
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:45,732
(humming "Bridal March")

71
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,002
You'll notice

72
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:51,337
that I used the quilted variety
for the bodice

73
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:53,206
and the edging on the veil.

74
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:56,109
Well, you all look fantastic,

75
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:58,845
but I think we have a winner--
Team C.

76
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:02,549
(Team C cheering)

77
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:04,417
Oh, Donny, I'm sorry.

78
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:05,919
Holly, it's not your fault.

79
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:09,322
I should have been more radiant.

80
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:10,757
Daphne, listen, if
there happens to be

81
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:12,692
another game that we play, do you
think you could arrange for me

82
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,661
to be on the same team as your friend
Holly there?

83
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:16,162
Oh, developed a little crush, have we?

84
00:03:16,162 --> 00:03:17,564
As a matter of fact, I have.

85
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:18,965
It's just that I haven't
had much of a chance

86
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:19,966
to get to speak with her at all.

87
00:03:20,466 --> 00:03:21,801
Well, I'll do what I can,

88
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:23,102
but I'm not really in charge here.

89
00:03:23,102 --> 00:03:24,604
(blows whistle)

90
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:26,105
All right, people.

91
00:03:26,105 --> 00:03:27,640
Next game, bridal charades.

92
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,642
(guests moaning and cheering)
(doorbell ringing)

93
00:03:29,642 --> 00:03:31,077
Oh, oh!

94
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:32,445
Roz, you know, someday
you're going to make

95
00:03:33,012 --> 00:03:34,013
a beautiful bride.

96
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:36,849
'Course, your dress won't be made out
of toilet paper.

97
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:38,084
Or be white.

98
00:03:38,084 --> 00:03:40,019
DONNY: Everybody.

99
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:41,521
Daphne...

100
00:03:41,521 --> 00:03:44,290
your big surprise has arrived.

101
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,059
Now, this is someone that I know

102
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,894
that you are dying to see.

103
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,562
Your parents?

104
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:51,231
No, not till next week.

105
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,966
My mother?

106
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:54,234
No, someone good.

107
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:56,736
My brother?

108
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,571
Your favorite brother.

109
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,240
Oh...

110
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,008
Yay! Stephen!

111
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:03,876
Ste... No.

112
00:04:04,777 --> 00:04:06,179
Billy.

113
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:07,113
Um...

114
00:04:07,113 --> 00:04:08,581
DAPHNE: Michael?
Well...

115
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:09,949
Nigel? David?

116
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:11,284
MAN: Hello.

117
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:12,952
Thirsty man waiting out here.

118
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:15,121
Simon.

119
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:17,457
Hello.

120
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:19,959
Daphne... come here.

121
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,262
Ah! I got you again!

122
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,698
Everyone,

123
00:04:25,698 --> 00:04:27,100
this is my brother, Simon.

124
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,534
ALL: Hi, Simon.

125
00:04:28,534 --> 00:04:30,870
Ah, Stilts, aren't you a sight?

126
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,205
"Stilts"?

127
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:34,107
Growing up, I was a
bit tall for my age.

128
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,676
Giant, like she was
on stilts.

129
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:38,177
They follow you, Simon.

130
00:04:38,177 --> 00:04:39,579
Yeah, right.

131
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:41,381
Well, it's nice to meet you all,

132
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:43,583
especially whichever one's
the bartender.

133
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,785
Oh, that would be me.

134
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:48,154
Oh, and a pretty
little bartender you are.

135
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:49,489
Right this way.

136
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:50,456
After you.

137
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:51,958
Oh.

138
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,460
I'd rather walk behind you, anyway.

139
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,962
I just love your accent.

140
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,463
It's so sophisticated.

141
00:04:57,463 --> 00:05:00,833
Oh, right.

142
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:07,440
DONNY: Oh, boy, I really screwed up,
didn't I?

143
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:09,442
Isn't Stephen the
favorite brother?

144
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:10,843
Yes. Even I knew that,

145
00:05:10,843 --> 00:05:12,512
and I barely listen to her.

146
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:13,813
I know, I know, I know.

147
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:14,814
I got the names mixed up,

148
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,316
but you have mentioned Simon, too.

149
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,817
Yeah, as a freeloader who just sits

150
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,252
around the house drinking beer all day.

151
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:20,586
Well, that's a lot of people.

152
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:21,988
You're retired.

153
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,859
You have such a dirty mind.

154
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:28,361
And that would be

155
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:31,230
a terrible thing to waste.

156
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:33,599
Uh, Simon...

157
00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:35,034
Yeah, right.

158
00:05:35,034 --> 00:05:36,536
This is Dr. Frasier Crane

159
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:37,537
and his father, Martin.

160
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:39,038
Oh, yeah. Pleasure to meet you.

161
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:40,073
Simon, how are you?

162
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:41,074
Pleasure to meet you.

163
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:42,575
These are the people I work for.

164
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:44,577
And you've met my fiance, Donny.

165
00:05:44,577 --> 00:05:46,512
Oh, thanks for flying me over.

166
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:47,447
Yeah, about that...

167
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:49,382
Didn't it seem unusual to you

168
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:50,950
when he called you
my favorite brother?

169
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,453
Mm. Now that you mention it,

170
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:55,722
it did strike my ear as a bit odd,

171
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:57,490
you being so partial to Stephen.

172
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:58,991
But then I thought,

173
00:05:58,991 --> 00:06:00,993
women change their minds
all the time.

174
00:06:00,993 --> 00:06:03,396
Brothers fall in and out of favor.

175
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:05,565
Maybe it's my turn.

176
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:06,833
And a good thing, too,

177
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,835
as it was an especially good time

178
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:11,304
for me to get out of England.

179
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:16,709
God, he talks just like a prince.

180
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:21,647
So, uh, Simon,

181
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:23,583
where are you staying?
Thanks, mate.

182
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,084
Uh, Donny here says

183
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:26,919
that Frasier's offered to put me up.

184
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:27,787
Yes, well, I mean, when he told me

185
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:29,589
that he was inviting
Daphne's favorite brother,

186
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:31,290
I-I didn't hesitate.

187
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:32,158
'Course, well, the sad truth is,

188
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:33,559
we don't really have a bed for you.

189
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,862
Oh, a couch will suit me just fine.

190
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:38,264
Well, I mean, you wouldn't
really be comfortable there

191
00:06:38,264 --> 00:06:39,599
for more than a day or two.

192
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:40,933
Oh, don't worry about that.

193
00:06:40,933 --> 00:06:42,935
I once slept on a couch
for three months

194
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:45,271
before I even realized
it pulled out.

195
00:06:47,473 --> 00:06:49,308
The main thing is that I spend

196
00:06:49,308 --> 00:06:51,811
as much time as possible
with my baby sister!

197
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:54,313
Oh! Simon, look what you did!

198
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:56,816
It was my absolute favorite dress--

199
00:06:56,816 --> 00:06:58,818
one I save for special occasions.

200
00:06:58,818 --> 00:07:00,820
He wasn't in the door
five minutes

201
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:01,821
before he ruined it.

202
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:03,823
And yet you still
felt responsible

203
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:05,324
for putting him up.

204
00:07:05,324 --> 00:07:06,826
I didn't have much choice.

205
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:07,827
If I turned him out,

206
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:09,662
I'd never hear the end
of it from Mum.

207
00:07:09,662 --> 00:07:11,497
I'm hearing that your relatives
are a source

208
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:13,266
of some anger for you.

209
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,435
So? Aren't yours?

210
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,837
Well, they might be if I still talked
to any of them.

211
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:23,509
Anyway, uh...

212
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:25,745
I can see how

213
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:27,713
your brother's presence
was adding stress,

214
00:07:27,713 --> 00:07:28,714
but what I'm not sure of

215
00:07:28,714 --> 00:07:30,216
is how you got from there

216
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:32,718
to causing a four-car pileup.

217
00:07:32,718 --> 00:07:35,188
DAPHNE: Well, things got
much more difficult

218
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:38,124
once Simon settled
into the house.

219
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:43,329
Good evening, Dr. Crane.

220
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:45,331
I hope you had a pleasant day.

221
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:47,800
Where's Simon?

222
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:51,804
I think he's out
with Mr. Crane again.

223
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:54,307
They seem to have taken quite a shine
to each other.

224
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,309
Simon's introduced him to rugby.

225
00:07:56,742 --> 00:07:58,244
Yes, I really must
thank him for that.

226
00:07:58,244 --> 00:08:01,614
After all, poor Dad, before he came,

227
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:02,882
had no sport to watch

228
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:06,385
between the hours
of 2:00 and 6:00 a.m.

229
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,422
Did you happen to see
the kitchen this morning?

230
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:12,358
Yes. I guess they
got some take-out.

231
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:16,195
It looked like a kung pao bomb
went off.

232
00:08:16,195 --> 00:08:18,064
I still have moo shu

233
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:21,067
stuck in the tread
of my driving moccasins.

234
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:25,404
I'm sorry Simon's been
such an imposition,

235
00:08:25,404 --> 00:08:27,206
but he's leaving soon.

236
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:29,709
He's decided to tour the
West Coast until the wedding.

237
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:30,710
Oh, Lord, that's a relief.

238
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:33,579
Yes... (sighs): Oh...

239
00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:34,947
Oh, by the by,

240
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:37,450
I invited my friend Holly over
for drinks tonight.

241
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:39,218
Maybe you could join us.

242
00:08:39,218 --> 00:08:40,520
Might give you two an opportunity

243
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,355
to get better acquainted.

244
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,190
Daphne, if you're offering up
your attractive friend

245
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,959
as some sort of a peace
offering, well, then, I accept.

246
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,194
Perhaps I'd better go

247
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,062
and make myself irresistible.

248
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:51,130
Well, you won't have time for much.

249
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:53,533
She's on her way now. Well, it's probably
better that way.

250
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,801
You know, give her a fighting chance.

251
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:58,804
Mr. Crane,

252
00:08:58,804 --> 00:09:00,072
I thought you were out with Simon.

253
00:09:00,072 --> 00:09:01,541
Nope, just Eddie.

254
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,842
Then where's Simon?

255
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:04,076
FRASIER: Daphne!

256
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:06,546
Your brother is in my bed!

257
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:09,549
Nude!

258
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:12,552
Simon Moon, get out of Dr. Crane's room!

259
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:13,953
MARTIN: Oh, that poor guy.

260
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:15,855
He probably just needed a nap.

261
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:16,856
It's the jet lag.

262
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:18,691
Couple of days, and he'll be on
our time.

263
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:20,826
A couple more days,
he'll be on our sidewalk.

264
00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:22,662
Oh, sorry about that.

265
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:25,031
I'm a bit sleepy today.

266
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:27,433
I think I'm coming down
with a cold.

267
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:30,202
(clearing throat and sniffling)

268
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:36,576
Nothing another night of
drinking won't cure, I'm sure.

269
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:37,944
Well, let's hope.

270
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:41,280
Is that my robe you're wearing?

271
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,582
Yeah, yeah. You want it back?

272
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,350
No, no.

273
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,117
It's all right.

274
00:09:45,117 --> 00:09:46,485
I got shorts underneath.
FRASIER: Oh, God.

275
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:47,887
Are those my shorts?

276
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:49,355
Well, I didn't think you'd mind.

277
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:52,124
I found them on the bathroom floor.

278
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:59,632
Look, if you need to lie down,

279
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:00,666
you can use my room.

280
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:01,667
Yeah, well, all right, yeah.

281
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:02,635
Don't forget to wake me for dinner.

282
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:04,604
I woke you for lunch, didn't I?

283
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,039
Yeah, right.

284
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:08,407
(doorbell ringing)

285
00:10:08,407 --> 00:10:09,775
Oh, dear God, that'll be Holly.

286
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:12,211
Dad, please, make yourself scarce.

287
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,849
Ah, Holly, hello again.

288
00:10:16,849 --> 00:10:18,718
Hello, Dr. Crane.
Nice to see you again.

289
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:20,386
Yes, yes, Uh, please, call me Frasier.

290
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:21,687
Come on in. Hi, Holly.

291
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:23,189
I'm glad you could make it.

292
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:25,191
Me, too. My boss can be
such a pain.

293
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:26,692
Oh, too bad.

294
00:10:26,692 --> 00:10:29,662
This one here keeps me
in stitches all day long.

295
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:33,165
Wocka-wocka!

296
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,135
Let me bring you girls
some drinks.

297
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,136
Oh, no, no, no,

298
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:38,638
let me get them.

299
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:39,605
Could you keep Holly company?

300
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:41,907
All right, uh...
Well, Holly...

301
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:42,808
um, please have a seat.

302
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:44,810
Uh, gosh, uh...

303
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:45,811
you know, we didn't really get

304
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:47,313
much of a chance to
talk at the shower,

305
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,315
but, uh, let me see...

306
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,183
You're in the music
business, aren't you?

307
00:10:51,183 --> 00:10:53,052
Yes. Right now, I'm planning

308
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:54,920
a reggae festival on Mercer Island.

309
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,789
Oh, well, I'll have to remind myself

310
00:10:56,789 --> 00:11:01,060
to take the rasta-ferry
over to catch it.

311
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:06,732
Frasier just told
the cutest little joke.

312
00:11:06,732 --> 00:11:07,733
Oh, I'm sorry.

313
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:10,069
I came back as quickly as I could.

314
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:12,805
Oh, I just remembered I left a tray

315
00:11:12,805 --> 00:11:14,674
of hors d'oeuvres on the kitchen counter.

316
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,042
Oh, no, let me, Daphne.

317
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:17,510
I'm not going to let you wait
on me all night.

318
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,545
DAPHNE: Well, thank you.

319
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:22,381
Allow me. Well?

320
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:24,216
Well, I like her.
Actually, you know what?

321
00:11:24,216 --> 00:11:25,718
I think she likes me, too.

322
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:28,554
So, are you going to ask her out?
Oh, now, now, Daphne.

323
00:11:28,554 --> 00:11:31,390
Can't rush things
with a girl like Holly.

324
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:32,892
After all, she's the kind of girl

325
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:33,893
you just don't do that to.

326
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:35,394
She has to be wooed.

327
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:36,395
You know, to be honest,

328
00:11:36,395 --> 00:11:37,897
this is the-the part of the dance

329
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:41,267
that excites me the most--

330
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:44,537
the coy verbal volleys,

331
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,806
the subtle body language,

332
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:47,740
the probing glances

333
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:51,744
as we explore our mutual passion.

334
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:54,547
Um... that jacket you're wearing

335
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,382
might be a bit too conservative.
Really?

336
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:57,817
Why don't you go and change?
Well, all right, all right.

337
00:11:57,817 --> 00:12:00,786
What do you think, maybe-maybe,
uh, maybe a sweater?

338
00:12:00,786 --> 00:12:02,288
Do you think I'd look
more freewheeling

339
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:05,091
in my blue and my...?

340
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:08,994
Good God.

341
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:12,998
He has a cold, you know.

342
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:22,108
I had no idea that Simon and Holly

343
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:24,110
had gotten so cozy at my wedding shower.

344
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,612
Of course, try telling that
to Dr. Crane.

345
00:12:26,612 --> 00:12:28,114
He blamed you for what happened?

346
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:29,081
Of course he did.

347
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:31,617
The tension in the house
was just getting worse.

348
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:33,619
Then two nights later,

349
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:36,622
I thought I was getting
a break from it all.

350
00:12:36,622 --> 00:12:39,625
I had the house all to myself
for a change,

351
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,127
which was a good thing,

352
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:43,129
because I was meeting
Donny's parents the next day.

353
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:45,631
I decided I'd use the evening

354
00:12:45,631 --> 00:12:49,135
to take a nice hot bath,
give myself a manicure...

355
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:51,904
you know, how you do.

356
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:56,909
Dr. Crane, what happened
to your concert?

357
00:12:56,909 --> 00:12:59,779
Simon happened.

358
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:02,114
I've caught his wretched cold.

359
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:04,817
I'm just going to go
curl up in bed.

360
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:08,587
After all, if I don't take
care of myself, who will?

361
00:13:08,587 --> 00:13:10,623
Make me some tea and honey,
won't you?

362
00:13:12,424 --> 00:13:14,760
Hey, Daph.

363
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,629
I thought you and Simon
were watching the game

364
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:17,530
down at McGinty's.

365
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:18,931
Nah, the cable went out.

366
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:20,800
I'll just watch it here.

367
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,101
Then where's Simon?

368
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:23,969
He's at the bar.
He met some people.

369
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:26,405
Oh, listen, if you're
going in the kitchen,

370
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:27,940
would you get me a beer?

371
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:28,874
He's got a real knack

372
00:13:28,874 --> 00:13:30,276
for making friends...

373
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:32,278
and a great storyteller.

374
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:34,280
Is it true you wet your pants

375
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:37,049
the first time
you saw a Chinese person?

376
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,718
He told you that?

377
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:41,120
Oh, he's going to kill me.

378
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,456
He was going to try to work it
into his wedding toast.

379
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:47,493
(shouting and laughter)

380
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,495
Come on in, make yourselves
comfortable.

381
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:50,963
Hey, Stilts,

382
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:52,364
I didn't know you'd be home.

383
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:54,033
God, what a sight.

384
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:55,467
If you took your teeth out
and put them in your pocket,

385
00:13:55,467 --> 00:13:57,870
you'd look like Mum.

386
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:00,639
Oh, sod off, Simon.

387
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:01,974
Who are these people?

388
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:02,908
These are some new friends of mine.

389
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:04,410
They've come 'round to watch the game.

390
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,912
This is Dan.
This is, uh...

391
00:14:06,912 --> 00:14:08,414
Judd.
Judd, yeah.

392
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:09,915
And this here is Paris.

393
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:10,749
MARTIN: Oh, Paris--

394
00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:11,884
does that make you French?

395
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:13,686
No, but a couple of beers might.

396
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,154
Brilliant! Brilliant!

397
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:16,655
(laughter)

398
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:18,958
What on earth is going on out here?

399
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:19,792
Oh, it's no big deal.

400
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:21,260
A few people just came over
to watch the game.

401
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,495
Well, you might have consulted
with me first.

402
00:14:23,495 --> 00:14:25,331
Let's get you back to bed,
Dr. Crane.

403
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:27,199
I'll bring your tea in a minute.
Very well, Daphne.

404
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,535
It seems I've caught
a cold from someone.

405
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,003
Well, you might've
mentioned that

406
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:33,272
before I took a nap in your bed.

407
00:14:34,506 --> 00:14:37,743
If you don't mind me saying, Marty,

408
00:14:37,743 --> 00:14:39,578
you're a saint for putting up with that man.

409
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:43,849
Your life must be very trying,
very trying indeed.

410
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:46,952
Oh, do not get me started.

411
00:14:46,952 --> 00:14:48,654
(doorbell rings)

412
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:49,989
Could someone get that?

413
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:51,824
I have a tray to make for Dr. Crane.

414
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:53,993
Bring out some beers, would you?

415
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:59,064
Hi, Simon.
Hello.

416
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:03,068
Are you ready?
To go to dinner?

417
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:04,870
We made a date.

418
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,672
Of course. Our date.

419
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:09,608
Uh, just-just hang on there
a minute, uh...

420
00:15:09,608 --> 00:15:10,476
Hello, Roz.

421
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:11,210
Roz, yeah.

422
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:12,878
I forgot where I put me jacket.

423
00:15:12,878 --> 00:15:14,713
Right here.
Right.

424
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:16,215
Well, I'm just going out
for a bit, love.

425
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:20,152
Make yourself comfortable.
I won't be late.

426
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:24,056
I don't believe this.

427
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:26,091
I got dressed up,
I got a sitter,

428
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:27,593
and you don't even remember
we made a date.

429
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:30,029
Some classy brother, Daphne.

430
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:31,463
Now you're making me feel bad.

431
00:15:31,463 --> 00:15:34,833
I'll tell you what--
dinner's on me tonight.

432
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:38,837
Daphne, can I talk to you
for a minute?

433
00:15:38,837 --> 00:15:40,606
Don't bother, Simon.

434
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,041
Hey, will you keep it down?
The game's on.

435
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:44,009
Right. Daph, how about some snacks?

436
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:45,711
Maybe a couple of sandwiches.

437
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:46,946
Oh, get it yourself.

438
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,415
I have laundry to check on.

439
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:51,417
Hey, did you do my delicates?

440
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:52,885
(huffs)

441
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:54,887
I thought I'd cool off

442
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:58,424
while I was in the laundry room,
but no such luck.

443
00:15:58,424 --> 00:16:00,225
Look at this!

444
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:03,495
My favorite dress ruined!

445
00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:05,831
(loud cheering)

446
00:16:05,831 --> 00:16:07,099
Just when I'd gotten
the wine stain out,

447
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:09,601
someone pulled it out of the machine

448
00:16:09,601 --> 00:16:11,603
and tossed it into a puddle of bleach.

449
00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:13,672
(loud cheering)

450
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:15,074
I got them back, though.

451
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:16,976
I pulled all their clothes
out of the dryer

452
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,945
and threw them onto the dirty, wet floor.

453
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:22,247
Oh, what do you care?

454
00:16:22,247 --> 00:16:24,583
I need a drink-- a big one.

455
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:25,918
(doorbell rings)

456
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:27,753
Oh, that'll be my date again.

457
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:29,521
I knew she couldn't stay mad long.

458
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:33,092
Coming, Rose!

459
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,462
Hi. Hello, Donny.
Who's this, then?

460
00:16:36,962 --> 00:16:38,464
My Mom and Dad-- I was
picking them up at the airport.

461
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:39,965
They couldn't wait to meet Daphne.

462
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:40,833
This is Simon,

463
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:41,767
Daphne's brother.

464
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:43,102
Oh, nice to meet you.
Yeah, hello.

465
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:43,969
How are you?

466
00:16:43,969 --> 00:16:45,337
Hey, word
to the wise:

467
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:47,606
Daphne's in a bit of a mood tonight.

468
00:16:47,606 --> 00:16:49,408
Why don't I just let her know
that you're here?

469
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:51,243
There. That's the last
of that bottle.

470
00:16:52,978 --> 00:16:54,213
Daphne, thanks for
bringing in my whiskey.

471
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:55,214
It's mine if you want it,

472
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:56,715
you'll have to fight me
for it, old man.

473
00:16:56,715 --> 00:16:58,784
Honey, honey...

474
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:00,986
Um, Mom, Dad, uh...

475
00:17:00,986 --> 00:17:02,454
(chuckles nervously)

476
00:17:05,257 --> 00:17:06,558
This is my fiance...

477
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:07,559
(chuckles)

478
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:09,561
Daphne.

479
00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:10,863
Hello.

480
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:14,833
Donny, I thought we were
doing this tomorrow.

481
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,268
Well, I wanted to surprise you.

482
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:17,336
Why, because your last surprise

483
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:20,105
worked out so well?

484
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:22,307
We should have called first.

485
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:24,209
This is so embarrassing.
I'm such a mess.

486
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:25,711
Come on, honey, you've looked worse.

487
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,179
Donny!

488
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:28,113
Maybe we'd better go.

489
00:17:28,113 --> 00:17:30,115
Oh, no, no, please come in.

490
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:31,617
The more, the merrier.

491
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:32,484
(doorbell rings)

492
00:17:32,484 --> 00:17:33,452
Oh, for God's sake,

493
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:35,454
who the hell is that now?

494
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:39,725
She's very lovely.

495
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,894
I know what you did.

496
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:44,663
Someone saw you leave
the laundry room.

497
00:17:44,663 --> 00:17:47,466
You threw all my wet clothes
all over the floor!

498
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:49,968
Oh, I'm sorry.

499
00:17:49,968 --> 00:17:52,337
I didn't realize they were still wet.

500
00:17:52,337 --> 00:17:54,706
Here... let me help.

501
00:17:54,706 --> 00:17:55,707
What are you doing?

502
00:17:55,707 --> 00:17:58,477
Ooh-hoo, that's nice and hot.

503
00:17:58,477 --> 00:17:59,611
WOMAN: Stop it!

504
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:01,380
What, not fast enough
for you? Here!

505
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,381
WOMAN: Stop it!

506
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:04,349
Maybe if we air-dried them!

507
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:07,219
There...!

508
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:09,655
That should do it!

509
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:11,156
You happy now?!

510
00:18:11,156 --> 00:18:15,561
(horns honking)
(tires screeching)

511
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:17,429
(cars crashing)

512
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:26,171
Fine! I guess I'll just have to
make my own tea!

513
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:29,174
It never occurred to me

514
00:18:29,174 --> 00:18:31,677
that stuff would fall
on people's windshields.

515
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:33,178
Well, I can certainly see

516
00:18:33,178 --> 00:18:34,146
why you felt provoked.

517
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:35,681
Thank you.

518
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:38,183
Now, if the judge had seen it your way,

519
00:18:38,183 --> 00:18:40,185
we could have all saved
ourselves a lot of time.

520
00:18:40,185 --> 00:18:42,688
There's something
that confuses me

521
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:44,089
just a little.

522
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:45,424
Yes?

523
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:47,392
This dress that was ruined--

524
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:49,294
you keep saying it was your favorite.

525
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:51,730
That's right.

526
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:52,664
So...

527
00:18:52,664 --> 00:18:55,534
why were you wearing it
at your bridal shower?

528
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:58,370
Well, it's a momentous event,
don't you think?

529
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:00,572
But you said it was a surprise.

530
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:02,875
Well, yes...

531
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:04,776
it was.

532
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:07,646
So... just what were you expecting

533
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,047
when you went over there?

534
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:13,952
Daphne. Right on time.

535
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:15,454
I'm glad you're here.

536
00:19:15,454 --> 00:19:16,455
Come in.

537
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:20,459
Let me, uh, take your coat.

538
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:22,461
I brought the recipe.

539
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:23,962
Hmm?

540
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:26,965
Oh, uh, uh, for, uh,
sticky toffee pudding.

541
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:28,467
Mm, mm, mm.

542
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:30,936
Well, that's why I'm here, isn't it?

543
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:33,438
To teach you to make it?

544
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:35,440
Yes.

545
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,210
You're not buying it, are you?

546
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:40,412
No, not really.

547
00:19:40,412 --> 00:19:42,748
So, uh...

548
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:44,750
you know why I asked you here tonight?

549
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,652
I think I do.

550
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:49,054
I mean, when a man
asks you to his house

551
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:52,491
to make pudding on a
Saturday night, you...

552
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:54,760
Pretty flimsy excuse, wasn't it?

553
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,895
Well, it got me here.

554
00:19:56,895 --> 00:19:59,064
Well, I'm glad.

555
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:01,900
Make yourself comfortable.

556
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,870
All right.

557
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:12,177
ALL: Surprise!

558
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:15,080
DONNY: Welcome to your shower, honey.

559
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,715
(laughing)

560
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,050
Oh, my God, you're trembling.

561
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,552
Yes, well... I'm
absolutely blown away.

562
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:21,820
Oh, come on, Daphne,

563
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,121
you were on to us.

564
00:20:23,121 --> 00:20:26,625
No, really... you had
me completely fooled.

565
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,627
(others laughing)

566
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:32,130
My God...

567
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:34,066
Dr. Crane...

568
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,001
You know, it might be time

569
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:38,403
to start calling him "Niles."

570
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:42,341
This is so confusing.

571
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:43,842
I mean, what about Donny?

572
00:20:43,842 --> 00:20:45,310
He's the man I love.

573
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:47,546
Are you sure about that?

574
00:20:51,617 --> 00:20:54,620
No.

575
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:57,623
Oh, I have so many questions.

576
00:20:57,623 --> 00:21:00,559
What does this mean?
What do I do?

577
00:21:02,494 --> 00:21:06,965
I'm sorry, but our time is up.

578

Scrambled eggs all over my face.

588
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:47,973
What is a boy to do?

589
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:52,711
Frasier has left the building.
