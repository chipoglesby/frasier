1
00:00:08,908 --> 00:00:10,977
Frasier, thank
God you're here.

2
00:00:10,977 --> 00:00:11,978
Why, what's wrong, Roz?

3
00:00:11,978 --> 00:00:12,979
My book club
meets tonight,

4
00:00:12,979 --> 00:00:13,980
and I haven't
read the book.

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,983
Oh, my, that is
a literary 911.

6
00:00:16,983 --> 00:00:18,451
I know.

7
00:00:18,451 --> 00:00:21,354
Wait. You joined a book club?

8
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:23,256
Why is that so
hard to believe?

9
00:00:23,256 --> 00:00:24,624
I like to read.

10
00:00:24,624 --> 00:00:25,325
What's his name?

11
00:00:25,325 --> 00:00:26,159
Jason.

12
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:27,093
Uh-huh.

13
00:00:27,093 --> 00:00:28,495
We met at
a bookstore,

14
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:29,929
and he asked me
to join his club.

15
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:31,931
He's separated,
but I think it's for keeps.

16
00:00:31,931 --> 00:00:34,234
He was buying
Divorce for Dummies.

17
00:00:34,234 --> 00:00:37,003
Sounds like a real catch, Roz.

18
00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:39,005
Anyway, I was
supposed to read

19
00:00:39,005 --> 00:00:40,006
The Great Gatsby
last night,

20
00:00:40,006 --> 00:00:41,508
but I couldn't get
Alice to sleep,

21
00:00:41,508 --> 00:00:43,009
so could you give
me a quick summary?

22
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:44,878
Well, all right.

23
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:49,049
Uh, it was a time known
as the Jazz Age.

24
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:54,454
Wall Street was booming,
bootleg hooch was flowing,

25
00:00:54,454 --> 00:00:56,456
and the young people
were doing a new dance

26
00:00:56,456 --> 00:00:59,259
called the Charleston.

27
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:00,060
Where were you
when I was trying

28
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,561
to get Alice to sleep?

29
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:02,962
Could you just get
to it already?

30
00:01:02,962 --> 00:01:05,365
Well, all right, fine.

31
00:01:05,365 --> 00:01:06,766
Lorna Lenley.

32
00:01:06,766 --> 00:01:09,069
Okay, who's she,
Gatsby's girlfriend?

33
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:10,970
The woman
who just walked in.

34
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:13,773
She was the great beauty
of my high school.

35
00:01:13,773 --> 00:01:16,776
She had brains, looks, style...

36
00:01:16,776 --> 00:01:18,778
and the way she filled out
a mohair sweater...

37
00:01:18,778 --> 00:01:19,779
well, suffice it to say,

38
00:01:19,779 --> 00:01:23,716
it was snugger on her
than on the goat.

39
00:01:23,716 --> 00:01:26,152
Why don't you go
over and say hello?

40
00:01:26,152 --> 00:01:28,555
Oh, God, Roz, she wouldn't
even remember me.

41
00:01:28,555 --> 00:01:29,956
She was with the in crowd.

42
00:01:29,956 --> 00:01:31,991
The only people who knew me
debated, recited

43
00:01:32,492 --> 00:01:34,494
or were on a six-month visit
from Abu Dhabi.

44
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:37,730
Oh, God, she's coming over.
She's coming over!

45
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:39,666
She's coming over!

46
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:41,167
Excuse me.

47
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:43,103
Didn't we go
to high school together?

48
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:44,571
Did we?

49
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:47,073
Yes. I thought
you looked familiar.

50
00:01:47,073 --> 00:01:48,408
You're Frasier,
aren't you?

51
00:01:48,408 --> 00:01:49,242
Well, that's right.

52
00:01:49,242 --> 00:01:51,744
Um... all right,
let me guess.

53
00:01:51,744 --> 00:01:54,547
Um... Lisa?

54
00:01:54,547 --> 00:01:55,348
Lorna.

55
00:01:55,348 --> 00:01:56,649
FRASIER:
Oh, yes, of course.

56
00:01:56,649 --> 00:01:58,184
Lorna, hello.

57
00:01:58,184 --> 00:02:01,821
Uh, Roz, I'd like you
to meet Lorna Anne Lenley.

58
00:02:01,821 --> 00:02:05,024
Was that... anywhere close?

59
00:02:05,024 --> 00:02:05,925
Wow, very good.

60
00:02:05,925 --> 00:02:07,393
Although it's
Gardener now,

61
00:02:07,393 --> 00:02:08,428
but I'm going back
to Lenley.

62
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:10,263
I was just recently
divorced.

63
00:02:10,263 --> 00:02:12,098
Oh, gosh,
I'm sorry to hear that.

64
00:02:12,098 --> 00:02:14,467
Roz, our chatting isn't, uh,

65
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:15,335
bothering your reading,
is it?

66
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:16,703
Oh, no. Actually, I...

67
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:18,104
Oh, right.

68
00:02:18,104 --> 00:02:20,607
Off I go.

69
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:23,610
So, uh, I-I'm divorced
myself, actually.

70
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:24,611
Yes, I know that.

71
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:25,512
I listen to your show.

72
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:26,846
Really?

73
00:02:26,846 --> 00:02:27,714
Well, I sell
real estate,

74
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:28,715
so I'm in my
car all the time,

75
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:30,650
so whenever I can,
I turn you on.

76
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:34,354
Oh, my.

77
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:35,121
(phone ringing)

78
00:02:35,121 --> 00:02:36,122
Oh, that's me.

79
00:02:36,122 --> 00:02:37,457
Excuse me, I
have to get that.

80
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:39,325
No problemo.

81
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:44,697
Roz...

82
00:02:44,697 --> 00:02:47,600
she's just as lovely as ever.

83
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,902
So, you going
to ask her out?

84
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:50,236
Oh, right.

85
00:02:50,236 --> 00:02:51,504
"Legs" Lenley and
Crane "The Brain."

86
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:53,339
In my dreams.

87
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:54,574
Frasier, you act

88
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:56,643
like you're still
some gawky teenager.

89
00:02:56,643 --> 00:02:59,012
You're a charming,
successful man.

90
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,346
Well, thank you, Roz.

91
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:02,715
No problemo.

92
00:03:03,883 --> 00:03:05,685
Excuse me.
I-I have to go show a house.

93
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,187
Frasier, it was really nice
to see you again.

94
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,589
Oh, likewise.

95
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:10,423
Uh, Lorna, listen,

96
00:03:10,423 --> 00:03:13,426
I-I realize that, uh,
this is out of the blue

97
00:03:13,426 --> 00:03:14,460
and that you're very busy,

98
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:18,398
but I was wondering
if you might like to, uh...

99
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:20,200
Yes?

100
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,069
...appraise my apartment.

101
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:25,505
See, I've decided to sell it.

102
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:28,107
Sure. Be happy to.

103
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:30,210
In fact, I'm free tonight.

104
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,511
Really? Uh, well, how's 7:00?

105
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:33,379
Uh, I live
at the Elliott Bay Towers.

106
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:35,048
Oh, wow, what a great building.

107
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:35,882
Yes, well...

108
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:36,883
You've certainly done well
for yourself.

109
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,384
Yes, well, I think

110
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:39,385
you'll find that
we've both come

111
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:40,887
a long way since
high school.

112
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:43,189
Oh, you know, here,
let me... let me
carry those for you.

113
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:44,924
Oh. Thank you.

114
00:03:52,131 --> 00:03:53,132
Dad, she'll be here
any minute.

115
00:03:53,132 --> 00:03:55,668
MARTIN:
Okay, okay,
I'm leaving.

116
00:03:55,668 --> 00:03:57,637
Listen, I'm sorry
to uproot you like this.

117
00:03:57,637 --> 00:03:59,072
It's just...
Oh, it's all right.

118
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,974
I'd rather clear the decks
for a date

119
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:03,276
than for one
of your theme parties.

120
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:05,511
Although I am
kind of sorry

121
00:04:05,511 --> 00:04:07,814
I missed an evening
with Moe Howard.

122
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:11,017
That was Noel Coward.

123
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:12,452
(doorbell ringing)

124
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:14,887
Oh, hey.
Hey, Dad.

125
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:16,723
Oh, Niles, what are
you doing here?

126
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:17,657
Well, I've got a crisis.

127
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:18,658
Uh, tomorrow's Mel's birthday,

128
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:20,159
and I'm planning
a very romantic evening,

129
00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:21,995
but my Gaggenau is on the fritz.

130
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:23,329
Oh, geez, I don't need
to hear this.

131
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:25,298
No, Dad...

132
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:27,166
it's a stove.

133
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:28,101
I know. Six burners
and a griddle.

134
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,403
Don't you guys ever talk
about cars?

135
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:34,240
Frasier, I'm desperate.

136
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,775
Can I possibly use
your kitchen tomorrow

137
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,610
to prepare the meal?
Yes, of
course, Niles,

138
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:38,411
but, listen,
now you-you've got to go.

139
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:39,646
I have a date.

140
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:41,481
Oh?

141
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:42,882
Anyone I know?

142
00:04:42,882 --> 00:04:44,784
As a matter of fact, yes.

143
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,185
Lorna Lenley.

144
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:49,956
Oh! No, really, who?

145
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:52,692
No, it's true. I-I bumped
into her today at the cafe.

146
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:54,127
Lorna Lenley?
Mm-hmm.

147
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,095
You, sir, have moxie.

148
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:57,964
Well...

149
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,365
Why, even with all
my vested authority

150
00:04:59,365 --> 00:05:00,833
as hall monitor,
I could never muster

151
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,869
the courage to ask to see
her bathroom pass,

152
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:03,836
and you asked her out?

153
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:05,738
Well...

154
00:05:05,738 --> 00:05:08,608
I bow down before you.
I doff my cap to you.

155
00:05:09,108 --> 00:05:09,976
Well, actually, it's...

156
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:10,810
it's not really a date.

157
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,313
I knew it.

158
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,248
You see, she's coming over
to appraise the apartment.

159
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:16,749
She's in real estate.

160
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:19,619
I tried to ask her
out and I choked.

161
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:20,953
I did get the impression

162
00:05:20,953 --> 00:05:22,755
that she was interested
in me, though.

163
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:24,557
Well, of course she is.
Oh, and the coach called.

164
00:05:24,557 --> 00:05:27,427
You're starting
the big game on Sunday.

165
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,329
That's very funny, Niles.

166
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,563
All right, off you go, now.
Come on.

167
00:05:30,563 --> 00:05:31,364
No, I want to see Lorna.

168
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:32,865
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, Niles, no.

169
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:34,367
You have to go.
(doorbell ringing)

170
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:35,668
Is that her?

171
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:37,236
She's here.
All right, okay, okay.

172
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:38,538
But, look...

173
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:40,039
you get one quick hello,

174
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:42,041
and then you're gone,
mister.

175
00:05:44,043 --> 00:05:45,545
Hello, Frasier.

176
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:46,546
Lorna, good to see you again.

177
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:48,548
Uh, perhaps you remember
my brother Niles.

178
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:49,482
Yes, hello, Niles.

179
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,190
Well, now that you two
have had a chance to catch up,

180
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,157
I'll see you later, Niles.

181
00:05:58,157 --> 00:05:59,492
Nice to see you again, Niles.

182
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:01,294
(chuckling)

183
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:07,200
Oh, Frasier, wow!

184
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,701
What a great apartment.

185
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:09,702
FRASIER:
Thank you.

186
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,571
Why are you selling it?

187
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:13,473
Oh, I don't want to bore you
with the details.

188
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:16,843
It's a very long,
very complicated story.

189
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:17,877
I'd love to hear it.

190
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:20,213
Uh, well...

191
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:24,016
I need more closet space.

192
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:26,652
Could I interest you
in some wine?

193
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:28,154
Oh, I would love some.

194
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:29,055
Ah.

195
00:06:32,358 --> 00:06:34,694
Do you remember Chip Clayton's
graduation party?

196
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:36,696
Remember, we broke into
his father's liquor cabinet

197
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:40,266
and we made sangria
out of a $100 bottle of wine?

198
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:41,033
(chuckles)

199
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:43,870
Thank you.
No.

200
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:44,871
You know what?

201
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:46,205
I should make
some notes

202
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:47,407
on your apartment.

203
00:06:49,642 --> 00:06:51,144
FRASIER:
What are you doing?

204
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:52,145
Tell her why
you really asked her over

205
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:54,147
and drop
this ridiculous charade.

206
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:57,583
You're not 16 years old
any longer.

207
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,886
Frasier, I'd love
to see your bedroom.

208
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:02,288
Of course.

209
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:06,726
Lorna Lenley wants
to see my bedroom!

210
00:07:10,696 --> 00:07:13,699
Oh, Frasier, wow,
another great room.

211
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:15,201
Thank you.

212
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:17,203
Is this bed
Scandinavian?

213
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:20,072
You have a good eye.

214
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:21,941
Lorna Lenley's on my bed!

215
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,944
Stop acting like an adolescent!

216
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:27,914
Frasier, are you all right?

217
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:30,883
No.

218
00:07:30,883 --> 00:07:34,353
No, actually, Lorna,
I'm not all right. Uh...

219
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:36,322
you see, when I saw
you this afternoon,

220
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:39,759
I immediately flashed back
to the hopeless crush

221
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,260
I had on you in high school.

222
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:44,230
Of course, it didn't
help matters much

223
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:46,732
that you've
hardly changed a bit,

224
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:52,004
and I wanted to ask you out
and I-I lost my nerve.

225
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:54,307
You mean, all of this

226
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:55,775
was just a ruse
to get me up here?

227
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:57,543
I'm afraid so.

228
00:07:57,543 --> 00:07:59,879
So now that
I've sufficiently
embarrassed myself,

229
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:01,681
I'll show you out.

230
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:07,520
You know, Frasier,
I have to say,

231
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,056
I'm really
very flattered.

232
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:11,457
Really?

233
00:08:11,457 --> 00:08:13,392
Yes.

234
00:08:13,392 --> 00:08:16,162
You know, it's not too late
to ask me out.

235
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:19,298
Would you like to
have dinner with
me this evening?

236
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:21,100
I'd love to.

237
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:24,070
Wonderful.

238
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:28,541
I'm going out
with Lorna Lenley!

239
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:46,726
Hi.

240
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:48,628
Hi.

241
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:53,132
Mm, I had a wonderful
time last night.

242
00:08:53,132 --> 00:08:54,567
Me, too.

243
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:55,968
It was like being back
in high school...

244
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:57,470
but with sex.

245
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,472
(laughing)

246
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:04,577
Oh, I don't want
this to end.

247
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:06,012
I must warn you,
now that I've learned

248
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:07,513
to finally ask you out,
I'll be doing

249
00:09:07,513 --> 00:09:09,515
a lot more of it.

250
00:09:09,515 --> 00:09:10,516
Are you free this evening?

251
00:09:10,516 --> 00:09:11,817
See, there I go already.

252
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:13,085
(chuckles)

253
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:14,887
How about
tomorrow night?

254
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:16,556
Somebody stop me.

255
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,457
Not me.

256
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:26,499
I wonder what
time it is.

257
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:28,501
Mm. Oh.

258
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:32,371
It's 10:00.

259
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:35,274
Oh, crap! I'm late!

260
00:09:35,274 --> 00:09:37,276
Is there something
I can do?

261
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:39,779
Oh, yeah, make this
lousy hangover go away.

262
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:42,782
Where the hell
are those aspirin?

263
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,586
You know, perhaps I should get
you a glass of water for those.

264
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:50,256
Uh, would you prefer
sparkling or still...

265
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,023
or not.

266
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:52,458
I see you're fine.

267
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:54,327
Oh, I'm sorry.
Did you want to finish this?

268
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:56,762
No, no,
you're the guest.

269
00:10:01,834 --> 00:10:03,302
Yeah, it's me.
I'm running late.

270
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:05,838
Move my 10:30 to 11:30.

271
00:10:05,838 --> 00:10:08,808
Just move
it to 11:30!

272
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:12,745
I didn't realize
you smoked.

273
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:14,246
Oh, yeah, I'm always
trying to quit,

274
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:15,648
buy my weight
just balloons up.

275
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:16,983
I mean, trust me,
you don't want to see my ass

276
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:19,285
when I'm off these things.

277
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:25,458
You know, I hate
to be a-a fusspot,

278
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,959
but I'd prefer...

279
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,394
(phone ringing)

280
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:31,130
Yeah.

281
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,399
Well, who let the dog in?

282
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:34,900
Put your brother on.

283
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,402
Put your brother on!

284
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:38,738
(yelling):
Put your brother on!

285
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:42,441
Oh, will you be a sweetie
and make me some coffee?

286
00:10:42,441 --> 00:10:44,744
Okay.

287
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:46,245
Well, you know
that mess better
be cleaned up

288
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:47,647
by the time
I get home.

289
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,582
Both of you.

290
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:51,083
Put your brother on.

291
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,985
Put your brother on!

292
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:55,988
(yelling):
Put your brother
on the phone!

293
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:01,160
Oh, this is nice.

294
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:08,868
I still don't understand

295
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:10,436
why you have to do
all the cooking.

296
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:12,438
Why don't you
just take Mel out
for a nice meal?

297
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:15,374
Oh, well, because
through cooking,

298
00:11:15,374 --> 00:11:16,876
I can truly express
my feelings for her.

299
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:18,444
You know, the French
have a saying...

300
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:19,345
Okay, okay.

301
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:20,212
I was just making
conversation

302
00:11:20,212 --> 00:11:22,214
till we got home.

303
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:24,216
Oh, hi, Dad.
Hey.

304
00:11:24,216 --> 00:11:25,551
Frasier...
Hello, Niles.

305
00:11:25,551 --> 00:11:26,886
I could really use
some help preparing

306
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:28,688
this dish today
if you're not busy.

307
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,990
Oh gosh, Niles, I've got
a lot of errands to run.

308
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,491
You know,
why don't you ask Daphne?

309
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:33,993
Uh, all right, all right.

310
00:11:33,993 --> 00:11:36,395
Ooh, ooh, ooh.
How did things go with Lorna?

311
00:11:36,395 --> 00:11:37,763
Oh...
Did you summon up
the courage

312
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:38,798
to ask her out?

313
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:40,299
Well, actually...

314
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:42,601
oh, come on, Frasier,
seize the moment.

315
00:11:42,601 --> 00:11:44,403
Faint heart never won fair lady.

316
00:11:44,403 --> 00:11:45,905
You know, the French
have a saying...

317
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:48,407
Morning, Niles.
Hey...

318
00:11:58,284 --> 00:11:59,151
Walk me out.

319
00:11:59,685 --> 00:12:00,653
Mm.

320
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:02,655
I have some
really great news.

321
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:05,491
Really? Do tell.

322
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:08,260
Well, I called my office,

323
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:11,197
and after my 11:30,

324
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:14,066
I'm free for the
rest of the day.

325
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:15,901
Oh, well, what are
you planning on doing?

326
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:18,738
Hmm, being with you,
silly.

327
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,039
Excuse me.

328
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:21,240
I'm coming!

329
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:25,144
You know, you are
the best thing

330
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:27,913
that's happened to me
in a long time.

331
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:39,225
I'm in. You happy?

332
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:55,107
Whisk.

333
00:12:58,677 --> 00:13:00,679
Spoon.

334
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:03,682
Cheese cloth.

335
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:09,688
(timer dings)

336
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:11,690
Perfect timing. Mm.

337
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:14,059
Daphne, open the oven.

338
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:21,901
Ah.

339
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:22,902
Ready.

340
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:24,403
Shall I close,
Dr. Crane?

341
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:26,405
Please.

342
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,975
Do you think it'll be all right?

343
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:31,644
It's out of our hands now,
Daphne.

344
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:35,447
(chuckles):
Ow...

345
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:36,949
Thank you
for your help.

346
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:38,417
Oh, my pleasure.

347
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:39,885
I haven't this much fun
in the kitchen

348
00:13:39,885 --> 00:13:42,888
since your brother caught
his tie in the pasta machine.

349
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:45,391
Oh, and the real fun's
just beginning.

350
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:46,392
Clean up... Ow!

351
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:48,394
Oh, oh, you silly sod.

352
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:49,829
Here, run it under
some cold water.

353
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,330
I'll fetch
the aloe cream.

354
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:54,400
Oh... dear.

355
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,837
Come here.

356
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,405
Oh, this will help.

357
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:00,906
I can't believe
I just did that.

358
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:03,342
Oh, I do that sort of thing
all the time.

359
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:04,243
You have to be careful.

360
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:06,545
Those pan handles get
awfully hot.

361
00:14:06,545 --> 00:14:07,346
Oh, well, not anymore.

362
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:10,850
It's got a protective
coating of skin on it now.

363
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,853
Just give it a minute to absorb.

364
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:16,322
Oh, it'll be fine.

365
00:14:17,823 --> 00:14:20,826
It's feeling
better already.

366
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:24,330
Thanks, Daphne.

367
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:25,231
MARTIN:
Hey, what's up?

368
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:27,666
Nothing. Why should
anything be up?

369
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,168
Dr. Crane burned his hand,
and I was tending to it.

370
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:31,070
That's all.

371
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:32,771
Oh, my.

372
00:14:32,771 --> 00:14:36,108
Look at the time.
I've got to run.

373
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:40,045
Burn, huh?

374
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:42,514
Well, you might want to keep
something cold on that.

375
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:43,916
Here.

376
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:45,317
You can hold
my beer for me

377
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:47,353
while I watch
the game.

378
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,191
Hello, Frasier.

379
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:53,726
Oh, hello, Niles.
How are you?

380
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:56,629
Fine, fine...

381
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:59,298
although the oddest thing
just happened.

382
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:01,433
Oh, that man on the corner's
name is Pete.

383
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:02,835
If you give him a dollar,
his monkey won't make

384
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:05,604
those rude gestures.

385
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,809
No, this is
about Daphne.

386
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:13,746
I burned my hand
while I was cooking,

387
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:16,715
and she began
putting first aid cream on it

388
00:15:16,715 --> 00:15:18,751
in a very tender way,

389
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:21,654
and then, uh, Dad came in,
and she jumped

390
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:23,522
as if she
felt guilty.

391
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:26,792
Is it possible
Daphne has feelings for me?

392
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:28,594
No.

393
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:34,800
Ah, well, as long
as you've considered
it from all angles.

394
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,102
If she was tender, it was
because you burned your hand.

395
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:38,570
If she jumped, it was
because Dad startled her.

396
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:40,039
Come on, Niles,
don't you see

397
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:41,040
what's really
going on here?

398
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,942
Obviously, I
haven't a clue.

399
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:46,378
I thought that man's monkey
was waving hello.

400
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:51,617
Your relationship with Mel
is growing deeper.

401
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:54,119
Isn't it possible
that your fear of commitment

402
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,621
is driving your mind
to throw up

403
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,523
these imaginary
roadblocks?

404
00:15:57,523 --> 00:15:59,825
You think so?
Well, you do have
a history of this.

405
00:15:59,825 --> 00:16:02,695
Remember the day
after you proposed to Maris?

406
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:05,130
You went that evening
to the opera

407
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,098
and you were convinced
that Leontyne Price

408
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:08,600
was winking at you
the whole night.

409
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,103
I suppose there could be
commitment issues here.

410
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:13,906
Cooking a meal for one's mate
is a big first step.

411
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:14,707
Yes, especially for you.

412
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:17,209
I mean, Maris never let
you cook for her.

413
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:18,077
That's true.

414
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:19,478
The closest I ever
got was restocking

415
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:23,349
the pills in her
bedside Lazy Susan.

416
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:24,717
Hey, guys.
Oh, hey, Roz.

417
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:27,720
Uh, Frasier,
thank you.

418
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,721
It's a big help.

419
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:29,722
My pleasure, Niles.

420
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:31,223
Bye.

421
00:16:31,223 --> 00:16:32,691
Oh, Roz, I see the book club

422
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:34,193
has moved on
to Wuthering Heights.

423
00:16:34,193 --> 00:16:35,461
ROZ:
Yes.
Well...

424
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:37,629
Please tell me they made
a movie out of this.

425
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:38,764
Twice.

426
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:41,033
Amen.

427
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:43,502
So, how did your
date with Lorna go?

428
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:44,536
Did you get up
enough nerve

429
00:16:44,536 --> 00:16:45,537
to ask her
to dinner?

430
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:48,007
To dinner
and breakfast.

431
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,808
We spent the night
together.

432
00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:52,945
Whoa. You went to bed
with the prom queen?

433
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:56,148
Yes, and I woke up with Carrie.

434
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:02,855
She smokes, she screams,
she's uncouth...

435
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,857
I'm actually meeting her here
to break it off.

436
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,725
So soon?
Well...

437
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:08,093
The way your love life's
been going,

438
00:17:08,093 --> 00:17:10,596
you may want to squeeze
a couple more dates out of it.

439
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:15,034
You know... nuts for the winter?

440
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:18,937
Please, Roz, I could never do
that sort of thing.

441
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:20,439
Whenever I know that I have
no future with a woman,

442
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:22,408
I end it right then and there.

443
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:24,777
Especially a woman
like Lorna--

444
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:27,246
recently divorced
and vulnerable.

445
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:28,747
You always take
the high road.

446
00:17:28,747 --> 00:17:31,050
Well, you know,
I'd like to think so.

447
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:34,820
If it's one thing I've learned,
my old high school wounds

448
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,723
are not going to be healed
by sleeping with the prom queen.

449
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:38,590
Tell me about it.

450
00:17:39,124 --> 00:17:41,593
Prom queen,
assistant principal...

451
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:44,129
You can't go home again.

452
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:47,733
Good luck.

453
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,234
How you doing,
baby cakes?

454
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:50,135
Oh, fine.

455
00:17:50,135 --> 00:17:53,505
Mm...
Mm...

456
00:17:53,505 --> 00:17:55,040
Thank you.

457
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,375
Mm.

458
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,944
Listen, uh, Lorna,

459
00:17:58,944 --> 00:18:00,546
about tomorrow night, um...

460
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:01,346
Oh, I'm sorry.

461
00:18:01,346 --> 00:18:03,348
I know we had plans,
but I completely forgot.

462
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:05,250
It's the retirement
dinner for Coach Pellet.

463
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,652
Who?

464
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:08,153
Our high school
football coach.

465
00:18:08,153 --> 00:18:09,922
I'd love it if
you'd go with me.

466
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,191
Well, I-I have to be honest
with you here...

467
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:13,992
Oh, come on.
It'll be fun.

468
00:18:13,992 --> 00:18:15,627
The old gang
will be there.

469
00:18:15,627 --> 00:18:17,496
The old gang, you say?

470
00:18:17,496 --> 00:18:18,497
Uh-huh.

471
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:19,998
You mean, like, um...

472
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:22,501
Chip Clayton
and Ladd Lundquist?

473
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:23,469
Yeah, the whole crowd.

474
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:25,437
Can you imagine the
looks on their faces

475
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:28,273
when they see us
walk in together?

476
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:31,443
Yes, imagine.

477
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:34,146
Oh, come on,
say you'll be my date.

478
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:36,014
Well, I...

479
00:18:36,014 --> 00:18:39,051
wouldn't want
to let down the coach.

480
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:44,056
You know, a spoon
would be nice!

481
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,294
Oh, everyone's
inside already.

482
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:50,362
I think we're
a little late.

483
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:51,363
Well, I guess
we'll just have to make

484
00:18:51,363 --> 00:18:52,831
a grand entrance.

485
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:53,832
After you.

486
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:55,234
Oh, no, I have to
go check my makeup.

487
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:57,569
Well, uh, why tamper
with perfection?

488
00:18:57,569 --> 00:18:59,905
Oh, aren't you sweet?

489
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:00,706
Shall we?

490
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:03,208
(phone ringing)

491
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:05,043
Sorry.

492
00:19:05,844 --> 00:19:07,880
Hello.

493
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,348
What now?

494
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:11,683
What? What?

495
00:19:11,683 --> 00:19:12,451
My phone's cutting out.

496
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:14,319
I'm sorry.
Just two seconds, sweetie.

497
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:25,998
(yelling):
No, you can't
have a party!

498
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:28,500
Because I said so.
Put your brother on.

499
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,935
Put your brother on.
Put your...

500
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:31,003
Just-just a second,
honey.

501
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:34,006
...brother
on the phone!

502
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,007
You know what?
Do what you want.

503
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:37,509
I-I'm on a date.

504
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:39,811
Sorry.

505
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:40,913
You ready?

506
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:42,247
Oh, you know what?

507
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:43,248
This hook keeps
coming undone.

508
00:19:43,248 --> 00:19:45,517
Right.
Do you mind?

509
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:46,818
You know, I just took
a look inside there.

510
00:19:46,818 --> 00:19:48,320
Everybody's here,

511
00:19:48,787 --> 00:19:52,324
even old Mr. Most-likely-
to-succeed Chip Clayton.

512
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:54,826
Chip Clayton's
a moron.

513
00:19:54,826 --> 00:19:57,296
Well, you used to be
rather fond of him

514
00:19:57,296 --> 00:19:58,297
back in school.

515
00:19:58,297 --> 00:20:01,233
Well, everybody's
changed since
high school...

516
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,702
except you.

517
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:06,138
Truly, you're...

518
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:08,140
you're still
the same sweet,

519
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,109
decent guy you
always were.

520
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:12,411
Thank you.

521
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:13,679
No, I mean it.

522
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,681
Believe me, I've
been with enough
jerks and users

523
00:20:15,681 --> 00:20:17,482
to know the difference.

524
00:20:17,482 --> 00:20:18,784
Let's go.

525
00:20:18,784 --> 00:20:20,719
Uh, Lorna...

526
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:23,622
I can't go in there with you.

527
00:20:23,622 --> 00:20:24,623
Why not?

528
00:20:25,123 --> 00:20:27,559
Well, because I came here
for the wrong reason--

529
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:29,461
so all the cool kids
would see me

530
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:31,897
with the school's
most popular girl,

531
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,733
and I let you believe
that we had...

532
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:37,135
hopes for some sort
of a future

533
00:20:37,135 --> 00:20:38,637
when I know in my heart
that there is none,

534
00:20:38,637 --> 00:20:42,140
and... well, if you
walked in there with me,

535
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,141
it would be as my trophy,

536
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:44,142
and I-I just can't
do that to you.

537
00:20:44,142 --> 00:20:46,511
I-I'm so sorry.

538
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,415
You...

539
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:52,417
you expect me to
walk into a room

540
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:54,820
full of my
ex-classmates
by myself?

541
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:57,222
Like some pathetic divorce
who couldn't scare up date

542
00:20:57,222 --> 00:20:58,223
for some old jock sendoff?

543
00:20:58,724 --> 00:20:59,524
I don't think so.

544
00:20:59,524 --> 00:21:00,726
Lorna, I...
You know,
I thought

545
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:01,660
you'd be a nice
rebound fling.

546
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,161
Get my feet wet
dating again.

547
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:04,463
You don't want
that? That's fine.

548
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:06,131
Wait a minute...
I'll tell you what
we are going to do!

549
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:06,999
You're going
to take my arm,

550
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:08,467
you're going to escort
me in that room,

551
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:10,469
we're going to dance,
make out like freshmen,

552
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:12,004
and leave with your
hand on my ass!

553
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:14,406
You got it?!

554
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:19,478
