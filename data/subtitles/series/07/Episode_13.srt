1
00:00:07,941 --> 00:00:10,377
Oh, don't you look nice?

2
00:00:10,377 --> 00:00:11,911
Yeah, Frasier wanted me dressed up

3
00:00:11,911 --> 00:00:14,447
for this mystery lunch of his.

4
00:00:14,447 --> 00:00:16,449
He hasn't told you what
the occasion is, either?

5
00:00:16,449 --> 00:00:18,952
No, but I'm sure
it's something very important.

6
00:00:18,952 --> 00:00:20,453
I'm sure he
wants to unveil

7
00:00:20,453 --> 00:00:23,957
his new antique
Elizabethan egg timer.

8
00:00:23,957 --> 00:00:27,460
Yeah, or debut
his Precolumbian spoon rest.

9
00:00:28,428 --> 00:00:29,863
Hello, all.
MARTIN:
Hey.

10
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:31,931
Well, Dad,
I see you're ready to roll.

11
00:00:31,931 --> 00:00:33,433
Yeah. Can you
at least tell us

12
00:00:33,433 --> 00:00:35,702
what kind of restaurant
you're taking us to?

13
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:36,536
Patience, Dad.

14
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:38,538
Roz'll be here in a few minutes,

15
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:41,307
then we'll be off
and all will be revealed.

16
00:00:41,307 --> 00:00:43,076
So, how did it go
with the doctor?

17
00:00:43,076 --> 00:00:44,544
Judging by that smile
on your face,

18
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,046
I'm guessing
your cholesterol's down.

19
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:47,547
Well, after several weeks

20
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:49,549
of watching my diet
and taking my medication

21
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:52,485
and race walking every Tuesday,
it hasn't budged.

22
00:00:52,485 --> 00:00:53,987
The good news is, though,

23
00:00:53,987 --> 00:00:56,890
that I've developed bursitis
to help take my mind off of it.

24
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:00,794
The doctor says it's all
just a matter of aging.

25
00:01:00,794 --> 00:01:02,762
Well, no reason to let it
ruin our festive lunch.

26
00:01:02,762 --> 00:01:04,297
Yeah... Boy,
you don't forget

27
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:06,266
that trip to the
doctor, do you?

28
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:08,735
That day he says, "There's
nothing I can do for you.

29
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:11,204
You're just getting old, sport."

30
00:01:11,204 --> 00:01:14,140
In my case, it was "slugger,"
but that was the gist.

31
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:15,141
You know what I realize?

32
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:17,010
When people reach
our stage of life...

33
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:18,311
Dad, please,
with all due respect,

34
00:01:18,311 --> 00:01:19,379
when it comes
to life's journeys,

35
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:21,381
you and I do not share a stage.

36
00:01:23,183 --> 00:01:25,351
We're not even
in the same theater.

37
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:28,054
You're taking this all
very cheerfully, Dr. Crane.

38
00:01:28,054 --> 00:01:28,788
(doorbell rings)

39
00:01:28,788 --> 00:01:30,123
Well, why shouldn't I?

40
00:01:30,123 --> 00:01:32,392
In many ways,
my life couldn't be better.

41
00:01:32,392 --> 00:01:33,259
I mean, by and large,

42
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:34,928
I'm in good health.

43
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:37,764
There's a promising new
relationship on the horizon--

44
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,265
the lovely Rachel.

45
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:41,267
My career is thriving.

46
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:42,769
Did you say "thriving"
or "diving"?

47
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:43,636
What?

48
00:01:43,636 --> 00:01:46,005
Look at these ratings.

49
00:01:46,005 --> 00:01:47,507
Oh, Roz, that's nothing
to worry about.

50
00:01:47,507 --> 00:01:49,375
For God's sakes,
they're just leveling off.

51
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:51,611
Yeah, that's what tends
to happen when you hit bottom.

52
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:53,513
There's no cause
for alarm here, Roz.

53
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:56,883
The important thing is that
we go on doing a quality show.

54
00:01:56,883 --> 00:01:58,651
Hey, how about
some quality lunch?

55
00:01:58,651 --> 00:01:59,919
Splendid idea, Dad.
Off we go, then.

56
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:01,921
Oh, uh, Niles will be
joining us there.

57
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:03,389
(cell phone rings)

58
00:02:03,389 --> 00:02:04,390
Excuse me.

59
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:05,658
Hello?

60
00:02:05,658 --> 00:02:09,963
Ah, Rachel, yes, uh...

61
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:11,464
momentito.

62
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:14,467
So, is Donny going
to be joining us?

63
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,469
No, he's got wedding business
this afternoon.

64
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:17,971
He's composing our vows.

65
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,372
Oh, isn't that romantic?

66
00:02:19,372 --> 00:02:22,308
He's not exactly Wordsworth
strolling through a shady glen.

67
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:25,311
When I left, he was lying
on the couch in his underwear

68
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:26,813
with a tin of Vienna sausages

69
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:28,581
and a rhyming dictionary
on his chest.

70
00:02:30,116 --> 00:02:32,418
Remember that new promising
relationship on the horizon?

71
00:02:32,418 --> 00:02:33,353
Yeah.

72
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:34,721
It just got married
in Vegas last night.

73
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:36,456
(groans)

74
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:40,326
Great, then you don't have a
date for Daphne's wedding?

75
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:42,562
Oh, I'll find a date,
don't worry, Roz. Lunch awaits.

76
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:44,264
Hey, great.

77
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:45,565
Why don't we
go together?

78
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:46,566
No, Roz, I assure you.

79
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:47,567
My dance card
will be punched.

80
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:49,068
By who?

81
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:50,069
Well, I don't know
right now.

82
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:52,071
It's just that I will be
"Crane plus one."

83
00:02:52,071 --> 00:02:53,039
Uh-huh.

84
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:55,008
Just in case
you don't get a date,

85
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,009
what time would you pick me up?

86
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,010
I'm getting a date.

87
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:58,511
Well, just in case.

88
00:02:58,511 --> 00:02:59,512
I'm getting a date.

89
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:00,513
What time are you
picking her up?

90
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:01,514
3:00.

91
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:02,515
Can you make it 3:30?

92
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:03,483
I'm getting a date!

93
00:03:07,987 --> 00:03:09,489
(indistinct chatter)

94
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:11,558
DAPHNE:
So, what's the big occasion?

95
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:12,992
Wait for it, Daphne,
let the moment build.

96
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:14,060
Besides, Niles
hasn't arrived yet.

97
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,528
I'd be surprised
if he came.

98
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:16,563
He's terrified
of this place.

99
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:17,830
Still?

100
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:19,899
My God, it's been 30 years.

101
00:03:19,899 --> 00:03:21,067
What happened?

102
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:22,402
Oh, Esther and I
brought the boys here

103
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:24,404
when they were kids, and
Niles was running around,

104
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:25,905
and he bumped into
the dessert trolley,

105
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:27,907
and Stefano got hot
and yelled at him,

106
00:03:27,907 --> 00:03:30,210
and Niles got terrified
and he... well...

107
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:30,910
He vomited.

108
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:31,711
Right.

109
00:03:33,012 --> 00:03:34,347
All over Stefano's shoes.

110
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:36,349
Then he ran out,
hid behind the car,

111
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:38,184
and he hasn't been
back in here since.

112
00:03:38,184 --> 00:03:39,485
Poor little weenie.

113
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:41,988
Hey, Dr. Crane!

114
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:44,490
Buon giorno, buon giorno,
buon giorno!

115
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,492
Oh, good to see you,
Stefano. How are you?

116
00:03:46,492 --> 00:03:48,494
Allow me to introduce
you to Daphne Moon...

117
00:03:48,494 --> 00:03:49,495
STEFANO:
Yes, yes.

118
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:51,464
And my father, Martin,
you remember, of course.

119
00:03:51,464 --> 00:03:52,832
Yes, hi, how are you?
This is...

120
00:03:52,832 --> 00:03:54,500
Hey, we all know Roz.

121
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:56,769
All right.

122
00:03:56,769 --> 00:03:58,771
For today, we've got
some special dishes.

123
00:03:58,771 --> 00:03:59,739
For you, Dr. Crane--

124
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,574
porcini,
fresh from Napoli.

125
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:02,442
Oh.

126
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:04,277
And for me?

127
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:06,946
Giorgio, fresh from Sicily.

128
00:04:06,946 --> 00:04:08,781
Can I get him to go?

129
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:10,149
You bet.

130
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:12,652
Okay, now, I'm going to be
waiting on you myself today.

131
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:14,654
You just give me a minute,
I come back.

132
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:16,155
Grazie.

133
00:04:16,155 --> 00:04:18,658
(cell phone ringing)

134
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:20,159
Excuse me.

135
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:23,096
Hello?

136
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:25,498
Yes, hello, Niles.

137
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:27,367
Oh, really?

138
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:29,636
Oh, what a shame.

139
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:31,337
Told ya.
No, that's all right.

140
00:04:31,337 --> 00:04:32,739
If your patient
is having a crisis,

141
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:33,740
you'd better address it...

142
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:34,741
before it turns into

143
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:38,745
a crippling, immature,
lifelong problem!

144
00:04:40,179 --> 00:04:42,181
You're not really
mad at him, are you?

145
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:43,616
Well, of course,
I'm mad at him.

146
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:45,018
I'm certainly
going to give him

147
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:46,586
a piece of my mind
at dinner tonight.

148
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:47,587
Tonight?

149
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:50,456
Oh, I was hoping you could come
to Alice's birthday party.

150
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:51,824
My balloon animal guy canceled,

151
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:53,826
and I could really
use your help.

152
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:55,828
I'm sorry, Niles made
the reservations a month ago.

153
00:04:55,828 --> 00:04:57,096
It's at Quelque Chose.

154
00:04:57,096 --> 00:04:58,998
Fine.

155
00:04:58,998 --> 00:05:00,300
Listen, if Niles
isn't coming,

156
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,402
maybe you can tell us
what the big surprise is.

157
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:05,104
Oh, all right,
I'll spill.

158
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:07,907
For over 60 years,
Stefano's has immortalized

159
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:10,343
Seattle's famous faces
on its walls,

160
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:12,078
as you can see.

161
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:14,881
With one notable exception.

162
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:17,817
It's me!

163
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,652
Stefano's unveiling
the portrait today.

164
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:21,321
Oh, how wonderful.

165
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,623
Hey, that's what I'll do
for Alice's party--

166
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:25,892
I'll get a cartoonist
to draw the kids.

167
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:26,659
That's an excellent idea, Roz,

168
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,161
but let's not forget
why we're here.

169
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,162
Does anybody have a toast?

170
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:32,165
Okay, Dr. Crane,
here it is.

171
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,166
My portrait?

172
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,667
No, it's today's specials.

173
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:36,169
Of course,
it's your portrait.

174
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,104
Would you like to say
a few words or something?

175
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:40,540
Well, uh, if you insist.

176
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:48,514
Before we unveil
this picture,

177
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:50,950
permit me to paint
one of my own.

178
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,419
A picture
of a young Frasier Crane,

179
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:57,924
wide-eyed, gazing at the walls
of Stefano's and wondering...

180
00:05:57,924 --> 00:05:59,926
"Who's that?"

181
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:03,930
Well, little did I suspect
that one day my picture

182
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:06,432
would be on the wall,
and perhaps now

183
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:10,436
other children will come in,
gaze at it, and wonder...

184
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:12,205
"Who's that?"

185
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,507
I'm betting that's
going to happen a lot.

186
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:18,578
So, thank you, Stefano,
for this honor.

187
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:20,580
Thank you
for suggesting it.

188
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:24,150
And now...

189
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:27,487
may I present Il Dottore!

190
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:29,522
Dr. Frasier Crane!

191
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:31,491
(gasping)

192
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:41,067
Fras, will you let it go?

193
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,635
It's a perfectly
nice picture.

194
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:43,569
Oh?

195
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:46,005
So, nothing about it
jumped out at you

196
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:48,508
as, oh, I don't know...
encephalitic?

197
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:51,644
So they gave you a big
forehead. Who cares?

198
00:06:51,644 --> 00:06:52,945
It makes you look smart.

199
00:06:52,945 --> 00:06:54,614
It makes me look
like I discovered fire.

200
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:58,084
Frasier, I was just
leaving you a note

201
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,585
apologizing for
that flimsy excuse.

202
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:01,587
I'm sorry, just the thought
of going back to that place

203
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:03,089
got my stomach
doing flip-flops.

204
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:05,057
Yeah, yeah.
Come on in, Niles.

205
00:07:07,326 --> 00:07:08,661
Oh, by the way, Daphne,

206
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:10,463
the doorman gave me this.
It's for you.

207
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:11,697
No, it's for Donny.

208
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:14,634
No, it's for
"Mrs. Donny Douglas."

209
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:17,837
Oh, funny, that's the first time
I've seen my name like that.

210
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:19,172
Well, get used to it.

211
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:21,007
That's you
in a couple of weeks.

212
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:21,841
So, how was lunch?

213
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:23,042
What was
the surprise?

214
00:07:23,042 --> 00:07:23,876
Don't ask.

215
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:25,211
The less said, the better.

216
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:26,579
They put his picture
on the wall,

217
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:28,881
and he thinks his forehead
looks a touch too big.

218
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:30,983
A touch?!

219
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:33,753
I look like a fugitive
from Easter Island.

220
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,090
Frasier,

221
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:40,193
you always think
you look bad in pictures.

222
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:42,028
Niles, this is not
some photo I can
just throw away.

223
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:45,031
This is a picture of me
in a famous restaurant.

224
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:47,333
God, I dreamed my entire life
of being on that wall.

225
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:48,100
And now you are.

226
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,369
Are you really so vain
that that's not honor enough?

227
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:51,671
Vanity has nothing
to do with it.

228
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:53,172
It's about misrepresentation.

229
00:07:53,172 --> 00:07:55,174
And you know, if I were you,
I would be careful

230
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:57,677
about bandying about
the word "vain,"

231
00:07:57,677 --> 00:08:00,112
Mr. $250 Haircut!

232
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:03,950
I have problem follicles.

233
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,489
Frasier,
it's a caricature.

234
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,324
They exaggerate stuff.

235
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:12,658
Now, if it were me,

236
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,527
they would have drawn
maybe a big cane.

237
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:15,661
If it were Niles,

238
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:16,395
they'd draw a barber

239
00:08:16,395 --> 00:08:18,965
cutting the hair
off a giant sucker.

240
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:26,372
I know you're sensitive
about your big forehead,

241
00:08:26,372 --> 00:08:28,541
but we all have
stuff like that.

242
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:29,809
With me, it's my eyes.

243
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:31,744
I've always fancied
sparkling blue ones

244
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:33,646
instead of dull old brown.

245
00:08:33,646 --> 00:08:35,014
Your eyes?

246
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,516
Your eyes are not dull.

247
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,784
Thank you, Dr. Crane.
That's very nice.

248
00:08:38,784 --> 00:08:42,588
They're... they're...
warm and, uh...

249
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:46,592
...full of life.

250
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:49,095
You have beautiful
eyes, too.

251
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,033
Oh, goodness.

252
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:58,037
I can't be lolly gagging
around here, I have to...

253
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:00,006
to get Dr. Crane his oat bran.

254
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:01,841
Oat bran? Now?

255
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:03,209
You'll need it for the morning.

256
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,211
You've got to have
something to sop up

257
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,179
all that nasty cholesterol
gumming up your heart.

258
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:09,148
If not, I'm liable to come home

259
00:09:09,148 --> 00:09:10,650
and find you face down
on the floor

260
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,652
with the dog
gnawing off your foot,

261
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:15,154
and I'm not making that up,
either. That happened.

262
00:09:15,154 --> 00:09:16,389
Cheerio.

263
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:21,627
I wish she'd move that fast
when I'm out of beer.

264
00:09:21,627 --> 00:09:23,563
Well, I should be off, too.

265
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,565
Are we still on
for dinner at Quelque Chose?

266
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,066
Oh, yes, yes,
of course, Niles.

267
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:28,501
You might want to call
and confirm.

268
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:29,735
Yes, I'll make a mental note.

269
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:31,037
Well, be careful
you don't lose it

270
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:33,539
inside that giant
puppet head of yours.

271
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:34,840
Good-bye, Niles!

272
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:39,145
Giant puppet head, indeed.

273
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:40,513
Oh, let it go, Frasier--
what are you going to do,

274
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:42,348
go down there
and make him change it?

275
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:44,617
Just accept it
for the honor it is,

276
00:09:44,617 --> 00:09:46,085
that's all.

277
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:47,086
You know,
I don't get you.

278
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:49,622
A doctor gives you bad news,
you take it in stride

279
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:50,623
but one bad picture...

280
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:51,624
Yes, thank you, Dad.

281
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:52,592
Hello.

282
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:55,561
Yes, I'm calling
about a reservation tonight.

283
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:57,997
For two. Crane.

284
00:09:57,997 --> 00:09:59,565
Well, what can I say,

285
00:09:59,565 --> 00:10:02,501
but I just love
your food, Stefano.

286
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:07,340
I'm in the mood
for Italian.

287
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:14,246
Will you come along, Niles?

288
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:15,047
I'd really
rather not.

289
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:17,049
I'm feeling queasy
just standing here.

290
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:19,051
You can hardly see
the picture from there.

291
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:20,553
All right, let's just
be quick about this.

292
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:22,555
Hello, do you have
a reservation?

293
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:24,557
Uh, yes. For Crane.

294
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:25,558
One moment.

295
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:26,959
You tricked me.

296
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,327
We'll just be here long enough

297
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:29,328
for me to talk to Stefano,

298
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:30,830
convince him to change
the picture

299
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:33,232
so it doesn't mock me
for the rest of my life.

300
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:34,634
Frasier, the man
has a violent temper.

301
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:35,601
He's already made me
humiliate myself once.

302
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:36,569
Niles, I can't believe

303
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:38,571
you're letting a minor
childhood trauma

304
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:39,572
like this plague you.

305
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:41,073
I have a feeling this may be

306
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:42,541
the root of your fear
of authority figures.

307
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:43,976
Listen, a nice,
relaxing

308
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:45,444
dinner here may
go a long way

309
00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:46,946
toward helping you
resolve this problem.

310
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:48,314
Dottore,

311
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,216
Dottore,how nice
to see you again.

312
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:52,218
Stefano, good to see you.

313
00:10:52,718 --> 00:10:53,686
And who is
this gentleman?

314
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:54,654
He looks
familiar to me.

315
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,122
This is my
brother, Niles.

316
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:58,124
Of course, you have
the family forehead.

317
00:10:58,124 --> 00:10:59,058
Come on.

318
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,461
Follow me.

319
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:04,296
Hey, Antonio, slow down!

320
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:05,598
(yelling in Italian)

321
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:07,933
What's the
matter with you?

322
00:11:07,933 --> 00:11:09,568
Come on

323
00:11:09,568 --> 00:11:10,903
sit down, we got
a nice table.

324
00:11:10,903 --> 00:11:11,904
Oh, thank you.

325
00:11:11,904 --> 00:11:13,406
Right under
your picture.

326
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:15,741
Okay, tonight,
no menus.

327
00:11:15,741 --> 00:11:17,610
I'm going to take care
of everything.

328
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,445
Except the bill, of course.

329
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:20,880
(laughs)

330
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:28,254
Well, there it is.

331
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:30,289
Frasier Cranium.

332
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:37,296
Well, it does have
a certain under-nuanced

333
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:39,298
over-contoured...

334
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:41,167
Macy's parade
kind of quality, but...

335
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:43,035
even so, you cannot

336
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:43,969
ask him to change it.

337
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:45,271
The man will explode.

338
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:48,074
Not if I do it
with the utmost tact.

339
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:48,908
Okay...

340
00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:51,277
here we are,
antipasto.

341
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:52,678
Oh...
Oh...

342
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:53,546
Wonderful, Stefano.

343
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,581
You know, you certainly
do have a way

344
00:11:55,581 --> 00:11:56,882
of making people
feel comfortable.

345
00:11:56,882 --> 00:12:01,153
I suspect that it would
actually physically pain you

346
00:12:01,153 --> 00:12:04,957
to think that someone
wasn't totally pleased.

347
00:12:04,957 --> 00:12:06,559
What's wrong?

348
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,393
Mm-mmm.

349
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,895
Well, actually...
well, there is a...

350
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:11,764
a tiny, tiny problem.

351
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:12,998
It's really about

352
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:14,867
my picture, you see.

353
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:18,204
There is a small faction

354
00:12:18,204 --> 00:12:21,340
that thinks the forehead
is too large.

355
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,141
What, this one?

356
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:24,543
No, I love it.

357
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:29,548
As do I.

358
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:31,050
It's just that, well, I...

359
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,052
I feel I might be
more recognizable

360
00:12:33,552 --> 00:12:37,022
if the forehead
were a tad smaller.

361
00:12:37,022 --> 00:12:37,990
So you don't like it?

362
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:38,858
It's not that.

363
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:39,625
It's not good enough for you?

364
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:40,326
Yes, it is.

365
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:41,393
You want me to have it changed?

366
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:42,161
Could you?

367
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:48,634
How long is this
going to take?

368
00:12:48,634 --> 00:12:50,169
Now, Niles, I was
fortunate enough

369
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:51,670
that the artist is
actually here tonight.

370
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:52,671
I'm certainly not
going to rush him.

371
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:55,174
Now, you better
finish your lasagna.

372
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:56,175
You don't want
to offend Stefano.

373
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:57,543
Offend him?

374
00:12:57,543 --> 00:13:00,446
So far tonight I have had
the prosciutto di Parma,

375
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,948
the pesto Genovese
and the Venetian sea bass.

376
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:04,450
One more bite,
and we'll conclude

377
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:07,453
our little tour of Italy
with my impression of Pompeii.

378
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:12,158
Hey, hey,
look who it is.

379
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:14,627
They'll let anyone
in this joint.

380
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,595
Hello, Kenny.

381
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:18,063
So what are you celebrating?

382
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:18,898
Not your ratings, huh?

383
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:20,199
I'm kidding!

384
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:21,700
You got to kid.

385
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:24,603
If you don't laugh,
you cry, right?

386
00:13:24,603 --> 00:13:26,005
So, did I hear a rumor

387
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:28,274
you're going up
on the wall of fame?
Oh, yes.

388
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:29,041
As a matter of fact,
they're putting

389
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:30,476
the finishing touches
on the picture right now.

390
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,378
Isn't that
something?

391
00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:33,879
Hey, hey, hey, you
better save some room.

392
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:35,381
Stefano goes crazy

393
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:36,816
if you pass
on his dessert.

394
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,250
My mother found that out
the hard way

395
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:40,252
on her 80th birthday.

396
00:13:40,252 --> 00:13:42,087
He went off on her.

397
00:13:42,087 --> 00:13:43,823
Called her a...

398
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:46,759
skoonja-boonja or something.

399
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:49,061
The kids had it memorized
for a while.

400
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:51,330
Well, enjoy.

401
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,131
STEFANO:
Okay, Dr. Crane.

402
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:54,533
Hot off the easel.

403
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:56,035
Is this one more
to your liking?

404
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:57,036
Oh, my.

405
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:58,037
Is it better?

406
00:13:58,037 --> 00:14:00,539
Well, it's like
looking in a mirror.

407
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:02,341
Okay, that's what
I want to hear.

408
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:04,543
You know, this is the first time

409
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:07,613
that anybody's ever
asked for a change.

410
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,114
Beautiful.

411
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:10,616
You make me so happy.

412
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:12,051
I'm going to see how
the steaks are coming.

413
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:13,118
Thank you.

414
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,623
Frasier, I hate
to burst your bubble,

415
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:21,660
but that picture looks
absolutely nothing like you.

416
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,628
Well, well...

417
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:27,433
I was wondering when Mr. Envy
would pull up a chair.

418
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:30,302
Ah, Kenny, Kenny.

419
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:33,305
If I may, can I direct your
attention to this caricature?

420
00:14:33,305 --> 00:14:35,307
Wow, look at that.
I am impressed.

421
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:36,242
I thought you might be.

422
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:38,544
James Garner eats here?

423
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:41,080
James Garner?

424
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,381
Well, I guess
I can go sit down now.

425
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,850
My father-in-law
just picked up the check.

426
00:14:46,318 --> 00:14:47,386
I don't believe this.

427
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:48,387
I've waited
my entire life

428
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:49,889
to have my picture
on this wall.

429
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:51,790
Now that it is,
it's unrecognizable.

430
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:52,725
Well, not for long.

431
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,093
No. Frasier,
you are not

432
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:55,794
going to ask him
to change it again.

433
00:14:55,794 --> 00:14:57,396
Niles...
if this means
so much to you,

434
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:58,597
my girlfriend
is a plastic surgeon.

435
00:14:58,597 --> 00:15:00,132
She can have you looking
like this picture

436
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:02,167
in six procedures or less.

437
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:02,968
All right,

438
00:15:02,968 --> 00:15:05,304
here we are, boys, here we are.

439
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:06,805
Mangia bene.

440
00:15:06,805 --> 00:15:09,308
Whoa!

441
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:10,309
Thank you.Grazie.

442
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:11,810
You know, there's
been something

443
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:14,280
that's been bugging
me all night.

444
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,481
Hey, shove over, will you?

445
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:19,785
I know you
from someplace,

446
00:15:19,785 --> 00:15:21,287
and I can't
figure out where.

447
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:23,656
And it's driving me
pazzo.

448
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:25,991
So, we got to figure
this out together, okay?

449
00:15:25,991 --> 00:15:27,459
You and me, all right?

450
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:29,428
You know,
while you two

451
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:30,396
are strolling down
memory lane,

452
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:32,398
I have a quick errand
I have to run.

453
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:33,399
I tell you what.

454
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:34,400
Save some dessert
for me.

455
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,401
Frasier, Frasier...

456
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:41,140
Uh, Roz...

457
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,609
Frasier, I knew you'd show up.

458
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:44,610
Yes, well, of course.

459
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,612
You knew how much it would
mean to me and Alice.

460
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,013
Oh, gosh, am I
that transparent?

461
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:48,847
Come on in.

462
00:15:48,847 --> 00:15:50,349
Everybody, this is Frasier.

463
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:51,917
Hello, hello. Hi.

464
00:15:51,917 --> 00:15:52,785
Can I get you something?

465
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:55,154
Jell-O? Lunchables?

466
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:56,121
Pokemon punch?

467
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:57,823
Do you have any coffee made?

468
00:15:57,823 --> 00:15:58,624
No.

469
00:15:58,624 --> 00:15:59,959
That's perfect.

470
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,294
I mean, while you're making
coffee, it'll give me some

471
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:04,196
quality time
with Alice.

472
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:13,038
Hey, no cuts.
I need

473
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:14,139
a picture right away.

474
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,808
I'll tell.
Do you know
who this is?

475
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:16,675
This is the birthday girl.

476
00:16:16,675 --> 00:16:17,676
If she wants a picture
right away,

477
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:19,144
she's gonna get a picture
right away.

478
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:20,079
Now why don't you run along?

479
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:24,450
All right, I think
you're finished.

480
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:25,784
Here we are.

481
00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:27,586
But I don't have any eyes.

482
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:28,854
Yes, well,

483
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:30,122
neither did
Little Orphan Annie

484
00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:32,124
and she's got her own
Broadway show. Now, go on, shoo.

485
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:33,993
Okay, fine.

486
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,361
I'm looking for something manly.

487
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:37,363
Go easy on the forehead
and leave the kid out.

488
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:48,941
Niles.

489
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:52,378
Where the hell
have you been?

490
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:53,379
Stefano's been
trying to place me

491
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:54,880
for the last 40 minutes.

492
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,382
Was I ever in Panama?

493
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:58,384
Did I sell him
his first Lincoln?

494
00:16:58,384 --> 00:17:01,153
Do I have a box
at the dog track?

495
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:02,488
Why don't you
just say "yes"

496
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:03,956
and let that be
the end of it?

497
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:06,291
Oh, that's a good idea.

498
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,194
What's that?

499
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:11,196
I went by Alice's
birthday party.

500
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:13,132
I had the artist there
draw me some new sketches.

501
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:14,533
Here. What do you think?

502
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,568
(gasps):
I think you're insane.

503
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:17,836
No, Niles,

504
00:17:17,836 --> 00:17:19,605
it's not so crazy,
really, just imagine.

505
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:20,939
Suppose that picture there

506
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:24,176
should accidentally
drop to the floor

507
00:17:24,176 --> 00:17:25,577
and tear.

508
00:17:25,577 --> 00:17:27,079
You see, I could come
back here tomorrow

509
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,580
tell Stefano
that I didn't want

510
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,015
to put his artist
to any more trouble

511
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:31,917
and I had a new
caricature done myself.

512
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:33,952
You see, I'm actually
partial to this one here.

513
00:17:33,952 --> 00:17:35,954
But there is one in here
of me playing soccer

514
00:17:35,954 --> 00:17:38,424
which is very good.

515
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:39,458
Frasier...

516
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:40,859
we'll put these away,
and we'll pay the bill

517
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:42,861
and we'll find a bed
to strap you into.

518
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:44,363
No, no, no, Niles.

519
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:45,364
This can work. It really can.

520
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:47,366
I promise you,
it can work.

521
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:50,102
What is this?
The pictures?

522
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:52,337
It's nothing, it's no business
of yours. Off you go.

523
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:55,274
Stefano.
Shh.

524
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:56,275
Stefano!

525
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:58,043
Mama, what is it?

526
00:17:58,043 --> 00:18:00,212
(speaks Italian)

527
00:18:00,212 --> 00:18:01,480
Dr. Crane,
what is this?

528
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:04,383
Oh, all right.

529
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:06,351
I may as well just
tell you the truth.

530
00:18:06,351 --> 00:18:09,688
The fact is, I don't really
care for this picture, either.

531
00:18:09,688 --> 00:18:11,423
It's just that
I'm afraid

532
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:12,791
your artist has
lost his touch.

533
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:14,793
To be honest, I think
he's robbing you blind.

534
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:17,129
I mean, my God, how much
is this hack charging you?

535
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:18,464
(cries)

536
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:19,465
Mama, Mama.

537
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:24,670
Mama's the hack, isn't she?

538
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:26,672
That's right.
(yelling in Italian)

539
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:29,174
Son of a gun,
get out of here!

540
00:18:29,174 --> 00:18:30,676
And don't ever
come back!

541
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:32,678
(yells in Italian)

542
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,982
You, hold on one second.

543
00:18:36,982 --> 00:18:38,283
Now... I remember you.

544
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:39,751
Oh...

545
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:42,154
Bridgeport, Connecticut.

546
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:44,056
Yes. Yes.

547
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:45,357
Right.
Yes.

548
00:18:45,357 --> 00:18:47,626
My car got stuck in the rain
and you saved my ass.

549
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:48,994
Yes, well, it was nothing.

550
00:18:48,994 --> 00:18:50,796
Glad you remembered.

551
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,965
Let me show you
how we thank you
where I come from.

552
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:00,839
Well, suffice it to say,

553
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:02,407
that the entire
Crane family

554
00:19:02,908 --> 00:19:03,876
is now banned
from Stefano's.

555
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:05,310
Just 'cause of
that dumb picture?

556
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,745
No, no, actually

557
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:08,747
there was a little incident
involving Niles, too.

558
00:19:10,048 --> 00:19:11,383
He was doing just fine

559
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:13,385
until Stefano took him
in some sort of a bear hug

560
00:19:13,385 --> 00:19:15,888
and shook him
a little too vigorously.

561
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:19,024
On the shoes again?

562
00:19:19,024 --> 00:19:20,325
No, this time there was

563
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:23,262
a conveniently placed
lobster tank.

564
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:25,430
Poor Niles.
Yeah.

565
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:27,699
Wasn't any picnic
for the lobsters either.

566
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,637
What the hell is wrong
with me, Dad?

567
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:33,672
I became so obsessed
with that damn picture

568
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,040
I completely lost my head.

569
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:38,310
Well, I think I know
what's really going on here.

570
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,711
Really?

571
00:19:39,711 --> 00:19:41,146
Well, enlighten us.

572
00:19:41,146 --> 00:19:43,549
Well, I think there's
some stuff in your life

573
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:44,883
that you can't control.

574
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:46,585
Your doctor tells you
you're getting old.

575
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:47,986
Your ratings are low.

576
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:49,988
You're not happy
with your love life.

577
00:19:49,988 --> 00:19:52,491
And so I think you obsessed
about this picture

578
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:54,993
because you figured it was
something in your life

579
00:19:54,993 --> 00:19:56,395
that you could control.

580
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:06,405
Well, Dad, you do raise a point.

581
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,675
Oh, what the hell,
you're dead on.

582
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:11,543
Where'd you learn so much
about psychology?

583
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:15,247
Oh, I listen to radio.

584
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:16,582
Gosh, it's so obvious, isn't it?

585
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:18,083
You know, when a person
is confronted

586
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:20,085
with some deeply troubling issue

587
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:21,587
that they're not
ready to face yet

588
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:22,588
they usually avoid the problem

589
00:20:23,088 --> 00:20:24,590
by obsessing
about something else--

590
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:25,591
something completely trivial.

591
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:27,359
Got it.

592
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:28,126
Got what?

593
00:20:28,126 --> 00:20:29,561
Dr. Crane's oat bran.

594
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,930
God, you left for that
eight hours ago.

595
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:33,298
Well, it wasn't easy.

596
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:35,334
They were out of it
at the regular market

597
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:36,335
so I went
to another one.

598
00:20:36,835 --> 00:20:37,769
But they
were out of it

599
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:39,137
so I looked into it

600
00:20:39,137 --> 00:20:39,938
and it turns out

601
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:41,940
they don't sell it
in Washington anymore.

602
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:44,443
Well, for some reason,
I just couldn't let it go.

603
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:46,245
So I went for a little drive.

604
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,847
It wouldn't kill you
to do something like
that once in a while.

605
00:20:48,847 --> 00:20:50,649
Get off that big, round
duff of yours.

606
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:54,653
Anyway... hop, skip
and a jump later...

607
00:20:55,153 --> 00:20:56,121
here it is.

608
00:20:56,121 --> 00:20:57,656
Fresh from Portland.

609
00:20:59,157 --> 00:21:00,158
Well, off to bed.

610
00:21:00,158 --> 00:21:01,460
Good night.

611
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:04,096
What the hell was that?

612
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:05,464
I don't know,
what did she mean

613
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:06,832
about that "big,
round duff" comment?

614
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:08,100
Now, Dad...

615
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,501
You know, the sands of time

616
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:11,770
don't exactly flow up
the hourglass.

617
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:15,674
It's not easy for a guy our age.

618
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:17,042
Dad, for the last time,

619
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:18,443
we are not the same age.

620
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:20,312
I mean, I've seen your
hips start to spread...

621
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:23,282
For Pete's sake, my hips
have nothing to do with this...
