1
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:09,442
Oh, hey, Frasier.

2
00:00:09,943 --> 00:00:11,511
Oh, hello, Roz.

3
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:13,346
Happy New Year.

4
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:15,081
Or should I say,
happy new millennium.

5
00:00:15,081 --> 00:00:15,882
Oh, barf.

6
00:00:16,449 --> 00:00:18,284
I'm so sick of
talking about
it.

7
00:00:18,284 --> 00:00:19,586
Oh, now, Roz, let's not condemn
the new millennium

8
00:00:20,086 --> 00:00:21,821
just because you woke up in it
with a hangover.

9
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,425
That's what ruined church
for you.

10
00:00:25,425 --> 00:00:27,961
Decaf latte,
please.

11
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:29,963
I just hate
how this arbitrary point

12
00:00:29,963 --> 00:00:31,931
on the calendar
has become so significant.

13
00:00:31,931 --> 00:00:34,300
And as far m
y hangover wen
t,

14
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:35,568
it was worth it.

15
00:00:35,568 --> 00:00:39,973
I partied my ass off like
a brain-damaged test monkey.

16
00:00:39,973 --> 00:00:41,241
I see.

17
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:42,809
Well, allow me
to congratulate you

18
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:44,811
on your first
science-related metaphor.

19
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:46,646
Thank yo
u.
Mm-hmm.

20
00:00:46,646 --> 00:00:47,447
And what did you do?

21
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:48,948
Get all freaky
and finish your list

22
00:00:48,948 --> 00:00:50,750
of the century's
greatest thinkers?

23
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,585
No, but my new year's was
plenty exciting enough,

24
00:00:52,585 --> 00:00:53,920
thank you very much.

25
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,224
Although... not exactly
in a way I'd planned.

26
00:00:58,725 --> 00:00:59,726
Cancel the millennium.

27
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:01,995
Chez Henri
has burned down!

28
00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:03,263
Burned down?

29
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:04,164
NILES:
Yes.

30
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:06,666
Apparently, Henri
was caramelizing

31
00:01:06,666 --> 00:01:08,168
a huge creme brulee

32
00:01:08,168 --> 00:01:10,503
in the shape
of Puget Sound

33
00:01:10,503 --> 00:01:12,138
when a sugar spark

34
00:01:12,138 --> 00:01:15,942
ignited a 30-foot papier
mââche space needle.

35
00:01:17,277 --> 00:01:18,678
They're already calling it

36
00:01:18,678 --> 00:01:22,148
the worst centerpiece disaster
in the history of Seattle.

37
00:01:22,148 --> 00:01:26,019
Henri built his reputation
with that caramelizing torch.

38
00:01:26,019 --> 00:01:29,956
My God. The irony of him burning
down his own restaurant with it.

39
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:32,325
It's worthy of O. Henry.

40
00:01:32,325 --> 00:01:36,096
O. Henri.

41
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:38,965
Please, Niles,
it's too soon to joke.

42
00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:40,967
What exactly are we going
to do tomorrow night?

43
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:42,469
Every restaurant in town

44
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:44,404
worth going to
has been booked for months.

45
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:45,305
Well, you know,
you can join me

46
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:46,706
and the boys
at McGinty's.

47
00:01:46,706 --> 00:01:47,607
It's going to be a lot of fun.

48
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:50,944
They're going to dye
the beer green.

49
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:52,812
Why would you do that
on New Year's Eve?

50
00:01:52,812 --> 00:01:55,315
Oh, well, McGinty's going in
for a bypass next month,

51
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:58,284
and he's afraid he might not
make it out for St. Patty's Day.

52
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:00,687
.
This is a disaster

53
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:03,723
No, they'll just pop in
another pig valve.

54
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:05,125
You know,
the only reason

55
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,060
he needs it is 'cause
he eats so much bacon.

56
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,061
So the same thing
that's killing him

57
00:02:08,561 --> 00:02:10,897
is keeping him alive.

58
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:13,633
There's your
O. Henry story.

59
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:17,003
Well, maybe we can just stay in
tomorrow night.

60
00:02:17,003 --> 00:02:20,006
On the most significant
New Year's Eve of our lifetime?

61
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:21,007
I think not.

62
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:23,009
I should have just gone with Mel.

63
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:24,511
She and her mother are taking

64
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:25,478
a hot air balloon

65
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:26,479
through the wine country.

66
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:29,582
Well, not in the balloon, no,

67
00:02:29,582 --> 00:02:32,919
but I could've followed along
in the recovery vehicle.

68
00:02:35,221 --> 00:02:36,222
Wait a minute.

69
00:02:36,222 --> 00:02:38,491
Speaking of wine,

70
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:41,227
wasn't the wine club having
some sort of a party?

71
00:02:41,227 --> 00:02:43,129
Yes, at Ken Lauterbach's
place in Sun Valley.

72
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:44,097
Oh, it's a huge event.

73
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:46,499
Of course!
"Auld Lang Wine"!

74
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:48,368
Niles, call and see
if we're still invited.

75
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:50,170
All right, I'm on it.

76
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,538
Bloody hell.

77
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:54,774
Five days
after Christmas is over,

78
00:02:54,774 --> 00:02:56,276
and I'm still getting
these cards.

79
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:58,144
They do it on purpose,
you know.

80
00:02:58,144 --> 00:02:59,546
It's always from someone
you forgot,

81
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:01,047
and then it's too late
to send one back.

82
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:03,550
Then they sneer at you
for the rest of the year.

83
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:06,419
"Peace and goodwill," my ass.

84
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:09,556
You just lost yourself
a customer,

85
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:11,057
Dr. Naran S. Gupta, D.D.S.

86
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:12,392
MARTIN
: Mm.

87
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:13,726
Losing a set
of English teeth.

88
00:03:13,726 --> 00:03:15,962
He'll feel that.

89
00:03:17,063 --> 00:03:19,365
This is for you
from the D.M.V.

90
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:21,367
is.
Oh-ho! I k
now what this

91
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:23,870
The custom plates I ordered for
my Winnebago.

92
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,872
Yay!

93
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:30,877
Well, 50 bucks,
but I think it says it all.

94
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:33,880
Rrrd?

95
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,883
Wrr...er?

96
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:39,886
Rid... worry...er?

97
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:40,887
!
Red wearer

98
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:44,824
Oh, for God's sake,
"Road Warrior."

99
00:03:44,824 --> 00:03:46,226
Of course.

100
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,727
For a retired man with a cane
and a Winnebago.

101
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:50,730
I don't know why my mind
didn't go straight to it.

102
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,532
NILES:
Huzzah!

103
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:53,833
Hello, Daphne.

104
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:55,335
Ken says he'd love to have us come,

105
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:56,836
and the more, the merrier.

106
00:03:56,836 --> 00:03:58,338
Oh, Niles, that's brilliant.

107
00:03:58,338 --> 00:03:59,839
Dad, please, please,
won't you join us?

108
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:01,140
You know what? Say,
let's call the travel agent.

109
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,442
Not to rain on your parade,

110
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:04,944
but you may have a tough time
getting flights this late.

111
00:04:04,944 --> 00:04:05,945
Donny and I had a devil of a time

112
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:07,947
getting our flight to San Francisco.

113
00:04:07,947 --> 00:04:09,215
Oh, Daphne,

114
00:04:09,215 --> 00:04:10,550
they always set aside

115
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:15,054
a few choice seats
for Seattle's travel elite.

116
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:20,026
(horn honking)

117
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:21,527
MAN:
Pick a lane, Road Warrior!

118
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:22,428
MARTIN: See?

119
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:23,329
He got it.

120
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:25,331
Hey!

121
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:32,905
MARTIN: Ah, being on the road
like this is like

122
00:04:32,905 --> 00:04:34,407
we're three dusty hoboes

123
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:38,745
sharing a boxcar to parts unknown.

124
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:42,181
Yes, well, if you don't take
this next turn,

125
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:45,618
we'll end up in Californy.

126
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:48,388
Gee, Niles, you seem a little cranky.

127
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:50,256
Well, perhaps that's because
I rousted out of a warm bed

128
00:04:50,256 --> 00:04:54,093
at the crack of dawn
and herded onto a Winnebago!

129
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:56,796
Better safe than sorry, Niles.

130
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:58,798
You know, it's 650 miles
to Sun Valley,

131
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,301
and half of that's
through the mountains.

132
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,802
By the way,

133
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,804
how are we going to explain
to the wine club

134
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,806
our arriving in a Winnebago?

135
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,808
Just chalk it
off to whimsy, Niles.

136
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:12,078
We'll call it our "Van Ordinaire."

137
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:15,348
You know, besides,
I'm actually enjoying

138
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:17,150
this little trip
through the heartland.

139
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,419
I feel a little bit out of touch
with the common man.

140
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:21,187
It's nice to reconnect.

141
00:05:22,955 --> 00:05:24,457
Well, while you're reconnecting,

142
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:26,359
why don't you let me drive?

143
00:05:28,194 --> 00:05:29,595
I-I would, Niles.

144
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:30,596
It's just that, um...

145
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:32,598
I ne... I need
you to navigate.

146
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:36,836
Yeah, you're the most important
member of our crew, good buddy.

147
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:40,640
The man with the map.

148
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,141
Stop patronizing me.
I want to drive.

149
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:45,645
Oh, you're not good
with big cars, Niles.

150
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:47,647
Remember when I tried to teach
you to drive my Le Sabre?

151
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:51,551
You kept panicking and pulling
on the emergency break.

152
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:52,919
Well, it's a good thing I did.

153
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:56,322
Those mailboxes weren't
even slowing me down.

154
00:05:56,322 --> 00:05:58,725
Oh, did you see that sign?

155
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:01,194
Little Red Cabin.
Remember those diners?

156
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:05,164
Home of the logroller:
a flank steak wrapped

157
00:06:05,164 --> 00:06:09,068
around a combination of eggs,
cheese and onions.

158
00:06:09,068 --> 00:06:11,771
You kids used to love
eating there.

159
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:13,539
You'd scream out at me,
"Dad, pull over!

160
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:16,476
Quick, pull over!"

161
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:19,412
Actually, Dad, that was after we ate.

162
00:06:23,182 --> 00:06:27,186
(humming to classical music)

163
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:31,691
Oh, Niles.

164
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:33,192
Thought you were sleeping.

165
00:06:33,192 --> 00:06:36,696
(Martin laughing)

166
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:38,698
I was trying to,

167
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:40,533
but Dad wanted to watch the VCR.

168
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:41,901
Oh, good Lord.

169
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:44,704
Not Robin and the Seven Hoods again?

170
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:46,939
(Martin laughing)

171
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:48,441
Worse.

172
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:49,809
(àà la Austin Powers):
Yeah, baby.

173
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:52,345
Now, that was
a shagadelic flick.

174
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:55,848
You know, Dad,
if you're quite done,

175
00:06:55,848 --> 00:06:57,350
I think I'll try
to take a nap.

176
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,852
Oh, behave.

177
00:07:03,856 --> 00:07:05,725
You know, Dad,

178
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:07,493
you do realize that
the Austin Powers craze

179
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:08,561
is completely over.

180
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:10,863
Well, I'm sorry.
Do I bore you?

181
00:07:10,863 --> 00:07:12,165
Or do I make you randy?

182
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:14,600
FRASIER: Oh...

183
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,536
(phone ringing)

184
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:21,507
Hello.

185
00:07:21,507 --> 00:07:24,377
Yes, Niles.

186
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:30,149
I'm driving as
smoothly as I can.

187
00:07:30,149 --> 00:07:31,717
Any other little driving tips

188
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:33,152
you'd like to give me?

189
00:07:33,152 --> 00:07:36,722
Why don't you just come up here
and tell me to my face!

190
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:38,057
Hey, look,

191
00:07:38,057 --> 00:07:39,859
another Little Red Cabin sign.

192
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:40,860
You know, we're not going
to find anything

193
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,361
better to eat on this highway.

194
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:43,830
Oh, let's no t be hasty, Dad.

195
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,298
It's five miles away.

196
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,767
We might run over something
before then.

197
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:52,972
You know, I am so tired,

198
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:54,974
I can barely read this menu.

199
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:56,476
That's all right, Niles,

200
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:57,443
you don't have to read.

201
00:07:57,443 --> 00:07:58,411
You can just point to a picture

202
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:00,913
of the food you want.

203
00:08:00,913 --> 00:08:02,248
MARTIN: What's this?

204
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:04,050
"A logroller with your choice of cheese"?

205
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:07,453
You can't have a logroller
without American cheese.

206
00:08:07,453 --> 00:08:08,821
Apparently, you can't get anything
in this restaurant

207
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:12,625
without American cheese.
.. including the menu.

208
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,460
Niles, if you're so tired,

209
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,963
why don't you go back to the Road
Warrior, take a nap?

210
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:19,966
Oh, you know, that's a good idea.

211
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:21,968
At least it'll be quiet.

212
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:24,937
I wonder if you can still get
sticky shingles here.

213
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:28,708
One look at the salad bar
says yes.

214
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,977
What looks good to you, Fras?

215
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:31,844
Well, actually, Dad,

216
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:37,250
you know, I think
I'll have a hamburger.

217
00:08:38,484 --> 00:08:40,653
Would you order that
for me, Dad?

218
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:42,021
Yeah. You going someplace?

219
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,489
FRASIER: As a matter
of fact, I am.

220
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:46,425
I'm going to take a chance
and reacquaint myself

221
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:50,429
with an old friend of mine:
America.

222
00:08:57,169 --> 00:08:58,437
Hello there.

223
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:02,542
Could I buy you a cup of coffee?

224
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:06,579
You see, I'm just
a wandering city mouse

225
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:09,615
trying to get in touch
with America.

226
00:09:09,615 --> 00:09:12,118
Now, you, you look
like you'd be a farmer.

227
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:14,120
Oh, I get it.

228
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,621
You see a guy in a rural diner

229
00:09:15,621 --> 00:09:17,123
wearing shab by clothes,

230
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:18,991
you pin your little label on him.

231
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:20,326
Well, guess what?

232
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:21,827
I am a farmer,

233
00:09:21,827 --> 00:09:23,829
but I'm also a beautiful,

234
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,299
flawed, complicated human being,

235
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:28,568
and it's going to take
more than a cup of coffee

236
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:29,769
to get inside here.

237
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:34,574
I'll just go see
how my father's doing.

238
00:09:36,275 --> 00:09:38,110
So, how was he?

239
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:40,413
Beautiful, flawed...

240
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:41,447
unpleasant.

241
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:44,383
Well, according to the map,

242
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:46,152
it's about 300 miles
to Sun Valley.

243
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:47,420
Oh, that's delightful, Dad.
You know what?

244
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,788
We'll get there in plenty of time
for the party.

245
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:50,656
Hey, listen, you know, your brother's
going to be hungry.

246
00:09:50,656 --> 00:09:51,657
Maybe we should
bring him a sandwich.

247
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:52,658
I wouldn't worry about Niles, Dad.

248
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:54,160
You saw how tired he was.

249
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,661
Let's just let him sleep
for the rest of the trip.

250
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:57,430
You sure?
Oh, sure.

251
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,198
It's the most exciting day
of the year, Dad.

252
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:00,633
For God's sakes, you know,

253
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:02,568
when Niles wakes up,
I guarantee you

254
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:03,569
the last thing he'd be thinking about

255
00:10:03,569 --> 00:10:07,039
is sandwiches.

256
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:15,748
WOMAN: Oh, my goodness.

257
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:18,250
Look what I just found in my pocket.

258
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,251
The lighter I borrowed

259
00:10:19,251 --> 00:10:20,753
from that waitress
in the restaurant.

260
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:22,254
I feel terrible.

261
00:10:22,254 --> 00:10:23,756
Forget it, Mother.

262
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:26,058
We're not taking it back.

263
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:30,896
MOTHER:
Well, I really think
we should just turn around

264
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:33,399
an-and say we're sorry
and return it.

265
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:35,401
MAN:
I think we ought to keep it.

266
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:38,404
Our old one's nearly out of fuel anyway.

267
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:39,872
MOTHER:
That doesn't make it right.

268
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:41,841
We're still criminals
in the eyes of the law.

269
00:10:43,876 --> 00:10:44,877
MAN: There's a lot
worse criminals

270
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:46,312
than you and me.

271
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:49,081
Remember that last
gun show we went to?

272
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:49,882
We must have seen

273
00:10:49,882 --> 00:10:51,384
at least three different people

274
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:52,885
swiping boxes of shells.

275
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:54,387
There's one thing
you can say for us :

276
00:10:54,887 --> 00:10:58,224
We pay for our ammo.

277
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,431
So, this party tonight--

278
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:10,369
going to be a lot
of shagnificent birds?

279
00:11:11,303 --> 00:11:14,306
Dad, I'm begging you.

280
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:18,244
(phone ringing)

281
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:20,646
Hello.

282
00:11:20,646 --> 00:11:23,649
Niles, will you please stop
doing this?!

283
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:28,154
I'm getting a little drowsy.

284
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:29,021
Well, if you're so tired,

285
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:30,790
just scootch over
I'll take the wheel.

286
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,324
MAN: Okay.

287
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:41,100
Yes, yes, hello.

288
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,601
I'm being kidnapped.
This is an emergency.

289
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:44,103
I'm being kidnapped.

290
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:48,107
I'm in a stolen Winnebago
heading east on I-84.

291
00:11:48,107 --> 00:11:51,110
I can't talk any louder.
I'm being stolen.

292
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:57,116
Yes, yes. Washington plates--
R-D-W-R-E-R.

293
00:11:57,116 --> 00:11:59,118
Road Warrior.

294
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:00,619
Yes, it does.

295
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:03,122
It does so. Sound it out.

296
00:12:03,622 --> 00:12:06,625
Never mind. Oh, for God's sake,
just save me.

297
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:09,628
MAN: Oh, I'm... I'm
getting too sleepy.

298
00:12:09,628 --> 00:12:11,630
I'm going back
for a little lie down.

299
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:12,531
Okay.

300
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:15,835
Oh, wait, Dad, look!

301
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:18,037
There's another one of
those Little Red Cabins.

302
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:20,139
Why don't we just stop
and have some supper first?

303
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:22,842
'Cause I'm tired,
and I'm not hungry.

304
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:24,243
Clifford.

305
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:29,115
Well, I guess a sandwich
wouldn't kill me.

306
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,788
MOTHER:
I feel sort of funny
even stopping here.

307
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:36,789
Sort of like returning

308
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:38,190
to the scene of the crime.

309
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:41,627
Mother, let it go.

310
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:49,502
(doors opening and closing)

311
00:13:09,021 --> 00:13:10,990
(engine starts)

312
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:25,638
All right, Eddie.

313
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:29,642
Let's go sign nature's guest book.

314
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:33,846
(phone ringing)

315
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:34,847
Hello.

316
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,348
NILES: Frasier?

317
00:13:36,348 --> 00:13:37,349
Yes.

318
00:13:37,349 --> 00:13:38,651
Niles.

319
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:43,856
Put your fears to rest.
I've got Dad's Winnebago back.

320
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:47,193
Niles, what on earth
are you talking about?

321
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:48,194
You must have had a nightmare.

322
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:50,162
Uh, indeed I have.

323
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:52,164
But it's over now,
and I managed to give the thugs

324
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:54,934
a taste of their own
thieving medicine.

325
00:13:55,701 --> 00:13:58,204
(gasps): Niles!

326
00:13:58,204 --> 00:14:00,172
Niles, where are
you calling from?!

327
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:03,075
From behind the wheel
of the Road Warrior.

328
00:14:04,476 --> 00:14:07,913
And doing a damn fine job
driving, I might add.

329
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:10,349
ButI'min the Road Warrior!

330
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:11,817
You got in the wrong car,
you idiot!

331
00:14:11,817 --> 00:14:14,820
You've stolen a Winnebago!

332
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,822
Oh, don't be absurd.

333
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:21,827
Oh.

334
00:14:23,095 --> 00:14:25,531
Oh.

335
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,867
Oh, my God!

336
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,568
(tires squealing)

337
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:35,441
(tires screeching)

338
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:36,876
All right, Niles,
just keep your head!

339
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,377
There's no need to panic!

340
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:40,379
MAN (over bullhorn):
This is the police!

341
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:41,881
Exit your vehicle immediately

342
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:46,352
with your hands above your head.

343
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:05,971
How's that turkey club, Dad?

344
00:15:05,971 --> 00:15:08,707
A little dry.

345
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:22,888
Sorry about the misunderstanding.

346
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:25,291
These papers all check out, sir.
Well,

347
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:26,692
if there's nothing
else, we're in a hurry

348
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:27,960
to get to Sun Valley.

349
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,696
But not too much of a hurry.

350
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:32,197
Well, drive safely.

351
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:33,999
FRASIER: Thank you.

352
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:35,334
What a clown.

353
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:36,835
I can tell you ten things he did wrong

354
00:15:36,835 --> 00:15:38,203
right off the bat.

355
00:15:38,203 --> 00:15:39,972
Well, at least he was apologetic.

356
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:41,840
Oh, these hick towns will give
any bozo a badge.

357
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,342
A goober like that wouldn't last

358
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:46,845
ten minutes in a real police force...

359
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:51,650
...without getting a promotion.

360
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:54,320
Your license.

361
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,822
(chuckles)

362
00:15:56,822 --> 00:15:58,657
(phone ringing)

363
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:02,995
Hello.

364
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:03,996
Hello, Frasier.

365
00:16:04,496 --> 00:16:05,497
I've managed to solve the problem.

366
00:16:05,497 --> 00:16:06,498
I returned the Winnebago.

367
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:08,000
To where? Where are you?

368
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,436
Well, I'm in Baker City, Oregon.

369
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:11,370
Baker City?!

370
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:14,373
Shag me rotten.
That's 300 miles!

371
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:17,876
Niles, we will never get there

372
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:20,245
and then back to Sun Valley
before midnight.

373
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:22,114
Well, I'm not going
to ring in the new year

374
00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:23,582
in a Little Red Cabin.

375
00:16:23,582 --> 00:16:25,584
All right, all right. Listen.

376
00:16:25,584 --> 00:16:27,086
The only way we can ever pull this off

377
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:29,088
is if you can catch a
ride in this direction.

378
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:30,990
Hold on. Hold on.

379
00:16:32,891 --> 00:16:35,394
Oh, my gosh. It's engraved.

380
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:37,896
Dad, I'm not going to enjoy
the rest of this trip

381
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:40,766
until we return that woman's lighter.

382
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:42,134
Mother, do you expect me to turn around

383
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:44,636
and drive 150 miles back

384
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:46,138
to that Little Red Cabin?

385
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:48,140
We are not going.

386
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,642
End of discussion.

387
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:52,011
Clifford.

388
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:59,184
Good news. I'm on my way.

389
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:01,520
All right, Niles says he can make it back

390
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,022
to the restaurant where we first
got separated.

391
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:05,524
All I have to do now is turn this boat around.

392
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:07,926
30 miles to the next exit.

393
00:17:07,926 --> 00:17:09,294
I can't wait that long.

394
00:17:09,294 --> 00:17:11,196
Well, you can't do a U-ey
on an interstate.

395
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:13,098
That's 20th-century talk, Dad.

396
00:17:13,098 --> 00:17:14,600
Welcome to the future!

397
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:15,968
(tires screeching)

398
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:28,981
God, that felt great!

399
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:30,482
Wow! This is really quite an adventure,

400
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:31,483
isn't it, Dad?

401
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:34,420
(siren blaring)

402
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,321
MARTIN: It is now.

403
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:38,357
Oh, dear God.

404
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:40,659
MARTIN: All right,
just relax, Frasier.

405
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:41,427
Now, I know cops.

406
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:42,428
Just let me do the talking.

407
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:43,829
We'll be out of here in two minutes.

408
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:46,165
All right, Dad, let's switch.

409
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:56,542
Well, look who's here.

410
00:17:56,542 --> 00:17:58,544
You boys know what you did wrong back there?

411
00:17:58,544 --> 00:18:00,546
Yeah, yeah, I know.
A U-turn.

412
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:04,550
Nope. Called me a goober.

413
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:14,359
(utensils clattering)

414
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:18,363
Oh, Niles,

415
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:20,232
I'm so sorry we're late.

416
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:21,600
Well, well, not to worry.

417
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,469
When you're here
at the crossroads of the world,

418
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:25,337
you have the human drama
to amuse you.

419
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:28,340
(sighs): Well, Happy
New Year, boys.

420
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,709
Oh, yes, five minutes ago.

421
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:33,078
Everyone in the world will have
a wonderful story to tell

422
00:18:33,078 --> 00:18:34,546
about where they were
and what they were doing

423
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:36,849
when the millennium dawned.

424
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:39,384
What isourstory?

425
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:41,687
Speeding along a lonely highway.

426
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:44,556
And you here, doing nothing.

427
00:18:44,556 --> 00:18:45,891
Well, not exactly nothing.

428
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:47,926
Big Sandy let me watch
the register

429
00:18:47,926 --> 00:18:50,262
while she emptied the rat traps.

430
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:55,834
Hey, wait a minute.

431
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:56,835
Where are we?

432
00:18:56,835 --> 00:18:58,337
Well, Dad, I've never seen a picture

433
00:18:58,337 --> 00:18:59,304
of the official middle
of nowhere, but...

434
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:01,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
but the middle of nowhere

435
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,841
Mountain Time, right?

436
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:06,178
It's still only 11:05, Pacific Time.

437
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:07,980
Which can't be more
than 45 minutes from here.

438
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:08,947
Right. We can cross the line

439
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:09,948
and toast in the new year together!

440
00:19:09,948 --> 00:19:11,650
Dad, that's brilliant!

441
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:12,718
And there was a delightful-
looking little restaurant

442
00:19:13,218 --> 00:19:14,219
just across the border.

443
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,721
MARTIN: Well, the guidebook said
it was pretentious.

444
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:17,222
FRASIER: Perfect! Let's roll!

445
00:19:18,223 --> 00:19:19,758
We're running out of time!

446
00:19:19,758 --> 00:19:20,792
Well, I'm doing my best, Frasier,

447
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:22,794
but we seem to be losing power.

448
00:19:22,794 --> 00:19:23,795
(engine sputtering)

449
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:24,796
What is that noise?

450
00:19:24,796 --> 00:19:26,198
What's wrong with the engine?

451
00:19:26,198 --> 00:19:28,500
I didn't touch the emergency brake.

452
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,203
When was the last time
you put gas in this thing?

453
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:32,504
Me? I don't even know
where the thing is

454
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:34,940
to put the gas into.
MARTIN: Oh, no.

455
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,375
I'm sorry, boys. It's dying.

456
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:39,144
I'm going to be lucky
to get this off the road.

457
00:19:39,144 --> 00:19:42,247
I can't stand this!

458
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:43,582
Have we so offended
the millennium gods

459
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:46,051
that they will do anything
to ruin this evening?

460
00:19:46,051 --> 00:19:47,519
Burn down our restaurant?!

461
00:19:48,053 --> 00:19:51,557
Hurl vindictive lawmen
and duplicate Winnebagos

462
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:53,959
in our path to confound us?!

463
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:55,360
Wait, is that a sign?

464
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,328
Of course it's a sign!

465
00:19:56,328 --> 00:19:57,829
It's a sign that we're cursed!

466
00:19:57,829 --> 00:20:00,132
No, no, no, it is! It's a sign!

467
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:01,400
We're entering Pacific Time Zone!

468
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:02,701
FRASIER: Oh, my God!

469
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:04,002
We're here!

470
00:20:04,002 --> 00:20:07,005
We made it!
We made it, oh!

471
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:09,508
Come on, Eddie.
Oh, 30 seconds to spare!

472
00:20:10,008 --> 00:20:10,809
All right.

473
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:12,144
We're rolling!

474
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:14,146
We're rolling backwards!
Oh, no!

475
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:16,348
No need to panic, Frasier!

476
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:18,850
(laughs)

477
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:22,854
We rolled back into Idaho!

478
00:20:22,854 --> 00:20:25,090
Follow me!

479
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:27,392
Ten seconds.

480
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:29,895
Let's look alive!

481
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,330
Damn this foil.

482
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:32,264
You can do it, Fras.

483
00:20:32,764 --> 00:20:34,166
Relax and focus.

484
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,068
Three, two, one...

485
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:38,070
(cork pops)
(laughs)

486
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,505
A-ha! We made it!
