1
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:15,882
MARTIN (over radio):
Rappy Rirfday, Rasier.

2
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:24,424
Why, Eddie, you can talk.

3
00:00:24,424 --> 00:00:27,227
I've always been
able to talk.

4
00:00:27,227 --> 00:00:29,696
I just save it
for special occasions

5
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:32,699
like somebody's rirfday.

6
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:34,200
Yes, yes, Eddie,
thank you very much.

7
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,202
But listen, I'd like
to talk about Dad.

8
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:39,139
I think his mind
may be slipping.

9
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:41,174
Hey, don't say stuff
like that to him.

10
00:00:41,174 --> 00:00:42,675
He's a dog-- he might
not know you're joking.

11
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:45,178
Why, Dad, I didn't even
know you were here.

12
00:00:45,178 --> 00:00:47,147
(chuckles):
Yes.

13
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:48,581
Well, just give me
a couple more minutes

14
00:00:48,581 --> 00:00:50,617
and I'll have your birthday
breakfast all ready.

15
00:00:50,617 --> 00:00:51,885
Come on, Eddie.

16
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:54,788
Right behind you.

17
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:02,328
Oh, well,
that's very nice, Dad.

18
00:01:02,328 --> 00:01:03,196
Yes.

19
00:01:03,196 --> 00:01:04,564
Oh, and look what I got.

20
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:06,900
A newspaper from the day
you were born.

21
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,301
I keep telling you
to clean out

22
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:09,803
that closet of yours.

23
00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:10,804
I ordered it.

24
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:12,806
Yes, well,
let's just see

25
00:01:12,806 --> 00:01:16,276
what other wonders
occurred on that day.

26
00:01:16,276 --> 00:01:18,278
(chuckles)

27
00:01:18,278 --> 00:01:23,650
"Suspected pinko ousted
from crossing guard post."

28
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:26,986
What a jolly world
I was born in to.

29
00:01:26,986 --> 00:01:28,488
Now, I know tonight's
your party...

30
00:01:28,488 --> 00:01:29,489
Oh...

31
00:01:29,989 --> 00:01:30,990
...but here.

32
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:32,459
Happy Birthday.

33
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:34,260
Make a wish.

34
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,028
Dad, thank you.

35
00:01:35,528 --> 00:01:37,831
(both chuckling)

36
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:39,132
What's the matter?

37
00:01:39,132 --> 00:01:40,600
My back...

38
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,102
Oh.

39
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:43,603
...it's completely
seized up.

40
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:44,604
Oh, okay.
Well, come on.

41
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:46,106
Now just take it easy.

42
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:47,107
There you go.

43
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:48,108
Real slow.
I-I...

44
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:50,043
There you go.
(grunts)

45
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:51,010
Oh, my God.

46
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:53,012
It's been
a little tender lately.

47
00:01:53,012 --> 00:01:55,014
I-I went to see
the doctor last week.

48
00:01:55,014 --> 00:01:57,383
He told me there was absolutely
nothing wrong with it.

49
00:01:57,383 --> 00:01:58,718
Doctors never tell you anything.

50
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:00,120
They're just a bunch
of overpaid quacks.

51
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,888
Oh, I'm sorry.

52
00:02:01,888 --> 00:02:02,755
I don't mean you.

53
00:02:02,755 --> 00:02:05,225
I mean, I'm talking
about real doctors.

54
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,660
How could this be
happening to me?

55
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:10,163
I'm always so conscientious
about back safety.

56
00:02:10,163 --> 00:02:11,164
Why, just the other day,

57
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:13,166
you know, when I needed
that large, heavy stack of books

58
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:14,667
from down in the storage room

59
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:16,669
I insisted that Daphne
make three trips.

60
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:18,438
Well, you know what,

61
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:20,707
I've got that old
girdle in my bedroom.

62
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:21,708
Let me go get it.

63
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:23,042
That should do it.
Dad, please.

64
00:02:23,042 --> 00:02:24,844
I'm not wearing anything
called a girdle.

65
00:02:24,844 --> 00:02:27,213
What if I called it
a back brace?

66
00:02:27,213 --> 00:02:28,948
Get it!

67
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:34,154
(doorbell rings)

68
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:40,693
Daphne?

69
00:02:40,693 --> 00:02:43,062
(doorbell rings)

70
00:02:43,062 --> 00:02:44,564
Good God!

71
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:51,538
Coming!

72
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:52,472
Oh!

73
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:57,911
This wouldn't be taking me
so long

74
00:02:57,911 --> 00:03:00,813
if my housekeeper were here.

75
00:03:03,816 --> 00:03:06,052
I'm a physical therapist.

76
00:03:06,052 --> 00:03:08,321
Perhaps you could get me
into a chair.

77
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:09,255
Oh, goodness!

78
00:03:09,255 --> 00:03:10,757
Is your back
bothering you again?

79
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:11,758
Thank you.
Thank you, Daph.

80
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:12,759
Oh, I'm sorry
I made you get up.

81
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:14,260
I forgot my key.

82
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,261
You know, perhaps
you should get

83
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:16,763
a spare set made just
to keep at Donny's.

84
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:18,765
For God's sake,
you're practically
living there as it is.

85
00:03:18,765 --> 00:03:21,267
Oh, now, Dr. Crane, you
better get used to it.

86
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:23,269
Once I'm married, I
will be living there.

87
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:24,771
I know what'll
help that back;

88
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:25,772
a nice massage.

89
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:26,739
Here you go.

90
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:28,074
Oh, the girdle.

91
00:03:28,074 --> 00:03:29,642
That'll help.

92
00:03:29,642 --> 00:03:30,877
Now, listen,

93
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,378
it's kind of hard
to put on by yourself,

94
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:34,380
but if Daphne holds one end
and I hold the other

95
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,382
you can kind of spin
into it.

96
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:38,251
Please, Dad, this is
humiliating enough as it is.

97
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:39,652
What's humiliating about it?

98
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:40,653
Now, you just hook it
in the back, like a bra.

99
00:03:40,653 --> 00:03:42,655
Just give me that!

100
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:49,596
Mr. Crane, does it bother you
when I stay over at Donny's?

101
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:50,830
No.

102
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,599
Well, it seems
to bother Dr. Crane.

103
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:54,901
Oh, he's just cranky
because of his back.

104
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:55,902
Good Lord!

105
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:58,271
Queen Elizabeth
had another baby.

106
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:01,741
I don't care
what science can do.

107
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,209
It's just not right.

108
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:12,151
Yes. Oh, that'll be
just fine right there.

109
00:04:12,151 --> 00:04:14,921
Be sure to thank the gang
for the flowers, Connie.

110
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,923
You're welcome,
Dr. Crane.

111
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,291
Happy Birthday.

112
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:19,592
Birthday?

113
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:23,129
Happy Birthday, Frasier.

114
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:24,464
Thank you, Roz.

115
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:27,967
It's not off
to the best start, though.

116
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:29,769
My back is out.

117
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:30,503
Why don't you go home?

118
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:32,038
We'll just air
The Best of Crane.

119
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:33,306
I'll drop your gift by later.

120
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:34,607
No, no, Roz.

121
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:35,608
Couldn't do that.

122
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,110
I promised my listeners

123
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,612
that I'd read
a birthday address.

124
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:42,115
Well, uh, people might
have forgotten.

125
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,617
People do have busy
lives, you know?

126
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:46,619
No, Roz,
I announced it twice.

127
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,621
Anyone paying even
the slightest attention

128
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:49,922
would know.

129
00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:52,525
Say, what are you
doing over there?

130
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:56,696
Just, uh, wondering
when to surprise you

131
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:58,364
with your present!

132
00:04:58,364 --> 00:05:00,166
Oh, Roz. Oh...

133
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:01,567
Guess now is as good
a time as any.

134
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,069
You know, we keep
promising each other

135
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:04,070
we're not going
to do this.

136
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:06,072
We have to stop
spoiling one another.

137
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:07,073
What am I
supposed to do,

138
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:08,574
just forget
your birthday?

139
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:09,575
Oh...

140
00:05:09,575 --> 00:05:11,077
Oh, good Lord, Roz.

141
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:12,078
You know, I read

142
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:14,580
the most wonderful review
of this recently.

143
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,581
I hope you like it.

144
00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:17,583
Oh, look,
you've inscribed it.

145
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:19,552
I did?

146
00:05:19,552 --> 00:05:22,522
"You'll always be my baby."

147
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:25,458
I must have had a glass of wine
when I wrote that.

148
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:26,459
Mm-hmm.

149
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:28,461
"Love, Mom."

150
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:34,167
Well, there's our bent
and broken birthday boy.

151
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,168
Hi, Niles.

152
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,136
I brought you
a little gift.

153
00:05:37,136 --> 00:05:38,938
Say hello
to sweet salvation--

154
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:41,307
the lumbar log.

155
00:05:41,307 --> 00:05:42,308
Oh, thank you, Niles.

156
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:43,676
Yes, yes.
You're welcome.

157
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:46,579
I think the whole thing is
probably stress-related.

158
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:48,081
Well, that's very possible.

159
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:50,883
You know, birthdays
can be anxiety-provoking,

160
00:05:50,883 --> 00:05:54,187
especially for people
of a certain age.

161
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:56,155
I am not of a certain age,
Niles.

162
00:05:56,155 --> 00:05:58,624
I am smack-dab in the middle
of "not a kid anymore."

163
00:05:58,624 --> 00:06:00,560
I won't be of a certain age
for another ten years.

164
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,962
You know, if your back
pain is stress-related,

165
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:04,464
I read a magazine
article

166
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:06,332
with an exercise
that might help.

167
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:08,701
You just go someplace
where nobody can hear you

168
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:10,670
and list all the things
that bug you.

169
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,105
And in what
esteemed medical journal

170
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:14,974
did you find
this little tidbit,Cosmo?

171
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:17,910
No.Glamour.

172
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:20,646
Oh, that's priceless.

173
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:22,415
"I can't find
he right shade of lipstick.

174
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:23,916
"I look terrible in a bikini.

175
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:26,686
He can't find my G-spot."

176
00:06:28,354 --> 00:06:30,656
I said do it someplace private.

177
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:33,025
You know, it couldn't hurt,
Frasier.

178
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:34,527
Oh, Niles,
it's absurd.

179
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:35,862
Hmm. The more you resist

180
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:38,131
the more I'm wondering
if there's something

181
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:39,465
you're trying to avoid.

182
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,934
Thanks for backing
me up, Niles.

183
00:06:41,934 --> 00:06:43,436
You know,
the same article said,

184
00:06:43,436 --> 00:06:44,904
"If you rub
a raw potato..."

185
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:47,306
if we're to sell him on this,
you should drop out now.

186
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:50,476
No one's going to
sell me on anything.

187
00:06:50,476 --> 00:06:51,978
That sort of exercise
only helps people

188
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:53,479
that lack self-awareness.

189
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:55,481
I, for one, am...

190
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:57,850
God Almighty!

191
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,685
Well, no wonder
you're stressed.

192
00:06:59,685 --> 00:07:02,121
You've got
a whole universe to run.

193
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:04,791
30 seconds, Frasier.

194
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,092
All right.
I'm going to be off.

195
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,794
You take care of yourself.
I'll see you tonight.

196
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:08,628
All right.

197
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:09,695
Are you sure you're
up to this?

198
00:07:09,695 --> 00:07:11,697
Oh, I'll be fine, Roz.

199
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:13,699
I'm not as delicate as all that.

200
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:14,667
How'd you do
it, anyway?

201
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:16,936
Blowing out a cupcake.

202
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:20,807
You know, Frasier,

203
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:23,209
we can always put
in a Best of Crane.

204
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:24,143
No, no, Roz.

205
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:26,446
Now just have
a little bit of faith in me.

206
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,814
I'm a lot tougher
than that.

207
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:29,282
I tell you what.

208
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,751
If I feel like I need help
toward the end of the show,

209
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:34,720
I'll give you
a little signal, all right?

210
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,189
All right.
Five seconds.

211
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:37,690
(inhales deeply)

212
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:41,627
Gosh, you know these flowers
really are beautiful.

213
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:45,031
Good afternoon, Seattle.

214
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:46,032
(sneezes)

215
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:47,033
(cries out)

216
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:48,000
(sneezes)

217
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,702
(cries out)

218
00:07:49,702 --> 00:07:50,970
(sneezes, cries out)

219
00:07:57,243 --> 00:08:00,313
(Frasier groaning)

220
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,815
Hello? Anyone here?

221
00:08:05,117 --> 00:08:06,619
I guess they're all out.

222
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:08,488
Okay. Well,
let's just get you settled.

223
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,889
Niles, Niles, slow down.

224
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:11,390
For God's sakes,

225
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,892
we're not running
a three-legged race.

226
00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:14,393
Ow! Ow! Ow!
Oh, oh, oh.
Ow. Okay.

227
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:16,362
Do you have somewhere to be?

228
00:08:16,362 --> 00:08:17,830
Well, since you
bring it up,

229
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,332
I do actually have a luncheon
with my new lady love.

230
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:20,833
Oh, well, gosh,
I'd hate to let

231
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,335
my pain stand in
the way of that.

232
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:23,836
How could that
orthopedist of yours

233
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:25,338
tell me there was
nothing wrong?

234
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,839
Frasier, I looked
at the X rays myself.

235
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,274
This is not
a skeletal problem.

236
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:29,675
All right, there.
Now, you're all fine,

237
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:31,177
and I'm sure
Dad will be by soon.

238
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,945
No, wait.

239
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:35,715
This couch has
absolutely no support.

240
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:38,651
Let's try the chair
over there, please?

241
00:08:38,651 --> 00:08:40,086
All right.

242
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:41,554
You're not heavy.

243
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:43,589
You're my brother.

244
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:46,993
Ow! Ow!

245
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:48,995
God, how could you even take me
to that unprofessional hack?

246
00:08:48,995 --> 00:08:51,497
All he did was give me a bottle
full of horse tranquilizers.

247
00:08:51,497 --> 00:08:53,499
He didn't care about getting
to the root of the problem.

248
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:55,501
He just wanted to shut me up.

249
00:08:55,501 --> 00:09:00,006
I think it might be time
for one of those pills.

250
00:09:02,508 --> 00:09:04,010
(groans)

251
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:06,012
All comfy?

252
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,549
Niles, uh, this won't do.

253
00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:12,485
It's even harder than
a seat on a public bus.

254
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:15,187
Oh, when were you
ever on a bus?

255
00:09:15,187 --> 00:09:18,324
At a cocktail party once,
for "The Friends of Transit."

256
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:20,593
I wasn't invited
to that.

257
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:22,895
Will you just help me up,
for God's sake?!

258
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:24,330
All right, all right.
Hold on, hold on.

259
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:25,831
Ow. Oh. Ow.
Okay?

260
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:27,333
Ow. Ow. Ow.
Shh, shh.

261
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:28,834
Ow, God, you know,

262
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:30,836
maybe I should take
another one of those pills.

263
00:09:30,836 --> 00:09:32,171
All right.
All right.

264
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:33,506
I'll get you
a glass of water, okay?

265
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:35,007
All right.
Let go, let go.

266
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:38,511
You know, things really
are going well with Mel.

267
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:40,980
I've been out with her
almost every night.

268
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,515
I don't want
to jinx things,

269
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:44,016
but I daresay we're
well on our way

270
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:48,521
to becoming what might
almost pass for an item.

271
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:52,525
(grunts)

272
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:53,993
I mean it, Frasier,

273
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:55,962
she was just the...

274
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:00,633
Oh, my God!

275
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:02,134
Did you fall?

276
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:03,135
No.

277
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:06,405
No, I'm actually
quite comfortable, Niles.

278
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:07,707
Look...

279
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:10,543
there's no glare
on the television

280
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:14,780
and here's a lovely place
to set your drink.

281
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,615
Just give me your hand

282
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,117
and whatever the chair's
telling you, don't listen.

283
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:19,018
No, Niles, no.

284
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:21,354
It's helping my back,
actually, you know,

285
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:24,790
and when you sit in it,
you don't have to look at it.

286
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,058
(chuckling)

287
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:27,460
If you're really
interested

288
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,462
in correcting this problem
and not just medicating it,

289
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,464
you should consider that
technique Roz mentioned--

290
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:32,732
listing your
problems aloud.

291
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:34,066
Oh, give me a break.

292
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:35,501
Well, it's perfectly possible

293
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:37,870
this is connected
to some submerged anxiety.

294
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:38,738
What's bothering you?

295
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:39,739
Oh, yes, Niles.

296
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:41,240
Do you really expect me

297
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,241
to sit here all alone
in this apartment

298
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:43,743
prattling on endlessly
about my problems

299
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:45,111
like some sort
of a lunatic?

300
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:46,479
If you think
I'm going to do that,

301
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:49,815
you're the one that needs
to get his head examined.

302
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:54,654
Oh,oh,good God!

303
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:55,655
Oh, Eddie.

304
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,156
Please, just shoo.

305
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:59,158
Get off of me,
get off of me.

306
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:01,160
(sighing)

307
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,467
What?

308
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:10,236
Oh, do you
want to know

309
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:11,937
what's bothering me, too?

310
00:11:11,937 --> 00:11:13,739
All right, well,
here's a start.

311
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:18,110
I'm talking to a dog--
that bothers me.

312
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:19,612
I'm another year older today.

313
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:21,447
I suppose that bothers me.

314
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:24,283
(whimpers)

315
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:26,786
Though not as much as
people seem to think.

316
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:28,788
(sighs)

317
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:33,192
I'm still single.

318
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:36,696
That's a big one...

319
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:40,700
not having a woman
to share my life with.

320
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:44,637
The only women in my life
are friends-- Roz and Daphne.

321
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:46,572
Daphne's not even
here anymore.

322
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:48,074
She'll be married soon.

323
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:50,509
That's going to
be tough on Dad.

324
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:52,945
Who am I kidding?

325
00:11:52,945 --> 00:11:56,449
It's going to be tough on me.

326
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:59,785
It's been nice having her here.

327
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:01,987
Even when my love life
isn't going so well,

328
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:06,726
I can always come home to a...
a warm and considerate woman.

329
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,594
You know, that's-
that's probably why

330
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:11,397
I've been so brusque
with her lately.

331
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:14,233
I know that once she's gone...

332
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:17,236
I'll probably be
twice as lonely.

333
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:21,240
Well...

334
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,442
it's quite a realization,
isn't it?

335
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:26,645
I really do
love Daphne...

336
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:33,886
...and, now,
I'm about to lose her.

337
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:35,888
I've got to show her
how I feel about her

338
00:12:35,888 --> 00:12:37,790
while I still have a chance.

339
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:44,597
Well, I don't know

340
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:47,099
if it was the therapy
or the-the painkillers,

341
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:49,602
but I actually feel
a bit better.

342
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:50,603
Let's try this.

343
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,104
(grunts)

344
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:53,105
Ah...

345
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:53,939
(chuckles)

346
00:12:57,143 --> 00:12:59,145
You know, there are subtler ways

347
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:00,913
to let the patient know
his hour is up.

348
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,182
(door closing)

349
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:04,583
DAPHNE:
Oh!

350
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:07,319
Dr. Crane,
I didn't know you were here.

351
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:08,454
Daphne.
Can't hear anything

352
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:09,822
in that shower of mine.

353
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:12,124
It's like a
soundproof vault.

354
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:13,893
Daphne, I-I wanted to apologize

355
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:16,695
for being so short
with you this morning.

356
00:13:16,695 --> 00:13:17,496
Oh, it's fine.

357
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:18,764
No, it's not.

358
00:13:18,764 --> 00:13:20,032
It's never fine.

359
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:21,801
Listen, come here, please.

360
00:13:29,074 --> 00:13:30,075
Give me a hug.

361
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:33,913
Oh, Daphne...

362
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:36,081
do you know how much
you mean to me?

363
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:37,983
I'm getting an idea.

364
00:13:42,688 --> 00:13:44,657
(door opening)

365
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:46,826
Hey, Daph.

366
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,928
(door closes)

367
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:50,262
What's wrong?

368
00:13:50,262 --> 00:13:51,197
You all right?

369
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:53,132
Well, actually, no.

370
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:57,136
I overheard something
I wasn't supposed to hear.

371
00:13:57,136 --> 00:14:00,072
It's about
Dr. Crane.

372
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:04,043
I overhead him say
he's in love with me.

373
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:05,544
What?

374
00:14:05,544 --> 00:14:08,047
Yeah, and he wants to show
me how much he loves me

375
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:09,415
while he still
has the chance.

376
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:11,684
Oh, geez, not this.

377
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,385
You knew about this?

378
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:15,054
I'm not getting
in the middle of this.

379
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:16,288
Then it's true.

380
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:17,790
Look, I kept my mouth shut
for six years.

381
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:20,226
I'm not saying
anything now.

382
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:21,794
Six years?!

383
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:23,796
He's felt this way
for six years?

384
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:25,231
You didn't hear that from me.

385
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:27,733
Daphne...

386
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:32,071
Daphne, I...
can't lower myself into the tub.

387
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:34,306
Well, don't look at me.

388
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:35,741
No, I thought I'd skip the bath

389
00:14:35,741 --> 00:14:37,743
and take you up
on that massage you offered.

390
00:14:37,743 --> 00:14:39,245
Those expert hands of yours

391
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:41,747
might be
just what the doctor ordered.

392
00:14:41,747 --> 00:14:44,149
Let's do it in my bedroom,
shall we?

393
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:54,560
Oh.

394
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,494
What kept you?

395
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:56,462
Daphne, here,

396
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:58,397
just help me
out of this robe, please.

397
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,766
I nearly killed myself
putting it on.

398
00:15:00,766 --> 00:15:02,635
(sighing)

399
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:07,172
(sighs)

400
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:11,176
All right.

401
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:14,013
(sighs)

402
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:16,749
Here we go.

403
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,187
Now...

404
00:15:22,187 --> 00:15:26,659
remember, your
back's very tender.

405
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:29,662
So... no sudden
movements.

406
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:30,963
(grunts)

407
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:38,304
(groans ecstatically)

408
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:39,805
Oh.

409
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:44,209
You know, I'm catching a draft
in this robe.

410
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:46,145
Perhaps I better change.

411
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:47,646
I'll be waiting.

412
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:55,354
Hey, Fras...

413
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:56,622
Yes, Dad?

414
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:57,990
Did Daphne tell you?

415
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:58,991
Tell me what?

416
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:01,393
She found out Niles
has a thing for her.

417
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:03,162
What?
Yes.
How?

418
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:05,064
Well, she said
she overheard him earlier

419
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:06,065
saying how much he loves her.

420
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:07,066
Oh, dear God.

421
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:09,068
No wonder
she's been so distracted.

422
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:10,536
And what did you say?

423
00:16:10,536 --> 00:16:11,570
Did you confirm it?

424
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:13,439
Well, yes, I said
I knew about it.

425
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:14,273
Oh, Dad...

426
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:15,741
Well, come on, what else
was I going to say?

427
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:17,209
Then I told her it was
none of my business,

428
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:19,044
and I took off out of there.

429
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:21,914
Wait a minute.

430
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:24,917
How did she even
see Niles today?

431
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:26,418
I don't know, but she said

432
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:27,920
she overheard him
saying he loves her

433
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,389
and that he wanted to tell her
while he still has a chance.

434
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:32,858
Oh, no.

435
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:34,827
What?

436
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,161
I said that.

437
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:37,563
Oh, not you now.

438
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:40,399
No, no, no, Dad,
not that.

439
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,735
I was just doing a little
exercise to try to help my back,

440
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:44,236
and I was talking out loud

441
00:16:44,236 --> 00:16:45,738
about how much I was going
to miss Daphne.

442
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:48,574
She must have overheard me
and misunderstood.

443
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:50,242
Who were you talking to?

444
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:57,483
If you must know,
I was talking to Eddie.

445
00:16:58,384 --> 00:17:00,319
Helps, doesn't it?

446
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:03,222
Oh, stop it.

447
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:04,223
Thanks to you,

448
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:06,191
now Daphne thinks
I'm in love with her,

449
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:08,127
and here I am
asking her for a massage.

450
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:10,062
How is she expected
to interpret that?

451
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:13,465
Hard to say.

452
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:14,466
Huh?

453
00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:15,968
Oh, boy.

454
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:17,970
Just take a deep breath
and try to relax.

455
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:18,971
Daphne...

456
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:20,973
Let's both do that, shall we?

457
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:21,874
Daphne...

458
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,809
Dad told me
that you overheard me.

459
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:24,810
He did?

460
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:26,045
Yes.

461
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:26,879
Well, I certainly picked

462
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:28,380
the wrong person to confide in.

463
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,648
No, no, no.

464
00:17:29,648 --> 00:17:30,949
I-I'm glad he told me

465
00:17:30,949 --> 00:17:33,952
because the truth is
you misunderstood.

466
00:17:33,952 --> 00:17:36,955
You see, when I said
how much I cared about you,

467
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:39,425
I didn't mean it
in a romantic sense.

468
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:41,727
Then you don't love me?

469
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:44,096
Oh, no, of course,
I love you, Daphne,

470
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:46,432
but... as a friend, that's all.

471
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:47,232
Oh...

472
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:48,567
Oh, thank God!

473
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,869
Oh, what a relief!

474
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:53,338
I mean, I was
flattered, but,oh...
yes, yes, all right.

475
00:17:53,338 --> 00:17:54,740
All right, okay,
fine, fine, Daphne.

476
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,241
That's fine. Off you go.

477
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:57,242
Go ahead.

478
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:58,744
Oh...

479
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:00,245
Oh, my, my head.

480
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:01,680
Oh, it must be
those pills.

481
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,682
Come on, let me give
you that massage

482
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:05,184
while you can
still feel it.

483
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:06,185
All right.

484
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:07,186
Come on, then.

485
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:08,687
Well...

486
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:11,190
(sighing and chuckling)

487
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:12,191
Oh, dear...

488
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:15,627
(sighing and moaning)

489
00:18:15,627 --> 00:18:16,562
You know, Daph,

490
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:19,431
we really are going
to miss you around here.

491
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:21,300
Oh, it's going to be hard
for me, too.

492
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,235
It's something
I haven't even wanted

493
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:24,736
to think about, leaving.

494
00:18:24,736 --> 00:18:28,107
I know I grumble
a bit, but...

495
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:32,478
I do love you
and your father.

496
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:33,979
I'll still come
around, though.

497
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:36,482
We'll all see
each other.

498
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:37,483
You know what?

499
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:39,318
What's that,
Dr. Crane?

500
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:41,019
Dad's chair.

501
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:45,824
I'm not taking it with me,
if that's where you're headed.

502
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:48,594
It felt comfortable.

503
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:52,364
You took quite a few of
those pills, didn't you?

504
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:55,467
You know what's curious, though?

505
00:18:56,401 --> 00:18:57,836
Cats?

506
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:01,240
Yes...

507
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,243
(chuckles)

508
00:19:04,743 --> 00:19:07,646
But I'm talking about
our little mix-up.

509
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:12,017
When I said to your father,
"Dr. Crane's in love with me,"

510
00:19:12,017 --> 00:19:15,053
he said it's been going on
for six years now.

511
00:19:15,053 --> 00:19:16,989
What did he mean by that?

512
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,924
Oh, that.

513
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:21,827
He meant Niles.

514
00:19:23,762 --> 00:19:25,063
What?

515
00:19:25,063 --> 00:19:26,365
Niles.

516
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:28,901
He's crazy about you.

517
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,672
Dr. Crane?

518
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:36,975
Dr. Crane...

519
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:45,651
MARTIN (over radio):
Come on, rirfday boy.

520
00:19:45,651 --> 00:19:46,952
Wakey, wakey.

521
00:19:46,952 --> 00:19:49,454
Time for cakey.

522
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:51,456
Dear God,

523
00:19:51,456 --> 00:19:54,459
has a year passed already?

524
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:55,794
(barks)

525
00:19:55,794 --> 00:19:57,996
Please, the elastic's pinching
behind my ears.

526
00:19:57,996 --> 00:20:00,365
Oh, come on, it's just
for a couple of hours.

527
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:01,366
But it's pulling my hair.

528
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:03,368
Well, you don't hear Eddie
complaining, do you?

529
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:06,371
I ruv my hat.

530
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:07,873
You know, I'm this close

531
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:10,375
to breaking that thing
into a million pieces.

532
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,377
Well, isn't this festive?

533
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:13,879
Oh, Daphne,
by the way,

534
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,347
thank you for the massage.

535
00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:16,381
I think it did
just the trick.

536
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:17,382
Anytime, Dr. Crane.

537
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:18,650
Listen, uh...

538
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:20,719
just before
I drifted off,

539
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:21,987
I-I'm afraid
I might have said something

540
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:23,855
I wish I hadn't.

541
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:26,024
Yes?

542
00:20:26,024 --> 00:20:28,727
It's about Dad's chair.

543
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,562
I mean,
it may be comfortable,

544
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,998
but I still want
to get it out of here.

545
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:34,900
Oh,that.
Right.

546
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,301
Why?

547
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:39,204
I didn't say anything else
I shouldn't have said, did I?

548
00:20:39,204 --> 00:20:42,107
Well, um...

549
00:20:42,107 --> 00:20:43,475
no.

550
00:20:43,475 --> 00:20:45,277
Ah.
No, no...

551
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:46,345
and don't worry.

552
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:47,779
Mum's the word.

553
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:48,847
(doorbell rings)

554
00:20:48,847 --> 00:20:49,848
I'll get it.

555
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:51,783
Thank you.

556
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:53,352
You straighten
things out with Daphne?

557
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:54,219
Yes, I did.

558
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:55,587
Boy, that was a close one.

559
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:56,989
I almost blew Niles' secret.

560
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:58,357
In the future, will you try
to be more discreet?

561
00:20:58,357 --> 00:21:00,759
I can't pull your chestnuts
out of the fire every time.

562
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:03,128
Good evening, Daphne.

563
00:21:03,128 --> 00:21:06,131
Dr. Crane.

564
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:07,633
You look different somehow.

565
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:10,502
Have you done something new
with your hair?

566
00:21:11,903 --> 00:21:12,904
Oh.

567
00:21:12,904 --> 00:21:13,739
Oh...

568
00:21:13,739 --> 00:21:14,673
That must be it.

569
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:15,674
Well, hello.

570
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:16,675
FRASIER:
Niles.

571
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:18,176
NILES:
Feeling better?

572
00:21:18,176 --> 00:21:20,679
FRASIER:
I'm feeling much
better, thank you.

573
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:23,081
Oh, that must be
a present for me.
