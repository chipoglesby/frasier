1
00:00:10,043 --> 00:00:11,344
Oh, uh, Dad.

2
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:13,113
It's not here yet.

3
00:00:13,113 --> 00:00:15,982
How did you...
You've been yakking
about it for weeks.

4
00:00:15,982 --> 00:00:16,983
Your new blazer's coming.

5
00:00:17,484 --> 00:00:18,985
It's Italian,
it's hand-stitched,

6
00:00:18,985 --> 00:00:20,887
it cost more money
than my first car.

7
00:00:20,887 --> 00:00:22,756
Yes, but it's made from
very expensive material.

8
00:00:22,756 --> 00:00:25,258
They have to find exactly
the right kind of goat.

9
00:00:25,258 --> 00:00:26,659
Looks like they did.

10
00:00:26,659 --> 00:00:28,862
DAPHNE:
Good morning,
Dr. Crane.

11
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:30,096
I made you a
special breakfast.

12
00:00:30,096 --> 00:00:31,631
Why, thank you,
Daphne.

13
00:00:31,631 --> 00:00:34,401
After all, blazer day
comes but once a year.

14
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:37,637
The doorman said he was
on his way up with it.

15
00:00:37,637 --> 00:00:39,639
I wonder what's keeping him.

16
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:42,175
Regan.

17
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:43,076
Frasier.

18
00:00:43,076 --> 00:00:45,478
Long time no see.

19
00:00:45,478 --> 00:00:48,248
Yes, yes, it has been.

20
00:00:48,248 --> 00:00:49,949
I think the last time

21
00:00:49,949 --> 00:00:52,385
was when you came over
with that bottle of wine.

22
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:54,254
Oh, right, right.

23
00:00:54,254 --> 00:00:55,655
And I met your
charming boyfriend.

24
00:00:55,655 --> 00:00:56,990
Scott.

25
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:59,059
Scott.

26
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,027
And he's not
my boyfriend anymore.

27
00:01:01,027 --> 00:01:03,496
Oh, well, he wasn't really
all that charming.

28
00:01:03,496 --> 00:01:04,764
(laughs)

29
00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:10,537
Well, it was nice seeing
you again, Frasier.

30
00:01:10,537 --> 00:01:11,838
Likewise.

31
00:01:20,146 --> 00:01:23,416
Isn't that interesting?

32
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:25,885
Just ran into Regan.

33
00:01:25,885 --> 00:01:29,122
It seems she's not seeing
that Scott anymore.

34
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:30,990
What, the ballplayer?
Is she nuts?

35
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:33,726
He had money, looks,
the whole package.

36
00:01:33,726 --> 00:01:35,829
Dad, let him go.

37
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:37,931
Are you going to ask her out?

38
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:39,732
I don't know.

39
00:01:39,732 --> 00:01:42,735
Every time I've had the chance
to get close to Regan,

40
00:01:42,735 --> 00:01:46,106
it seems I end up
looking ridiculous.

41
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:47,941
Still...

42
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,442
she did make a point
of letting me know

43
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:52,445
that she was single again.

44
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:54,948
Perhaps she's hinting
for another ride

45
00:01:55,381 --> 00:01:57,884
on the Frasier-go-round.

46
00:01:57,884 --> 00:02:00,253
Now, if we could just figure out

47
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:02,589
why you always look ridiculous.

48
00:02:04,757 --> 00:02:06,025
Please, you're my last chance.

49
00:02:06,025 --> 00:02:08,528
Couldn't you...? All right,
no, it's okay, I understand.

50
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:10,096
I understand.
Don't worry about it. Bye.

51
00:02:10,096 --> 00:02:11,064
(groans)

52
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:12,031
Problem?

53
00:02:12,031 --> 00:02:13,533
Yeah, it's my
bachelor party.

54
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:14,601
My best man
can't arrange it.

55
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:16,102
I'm having a hell
of a time

56
00:02:16,102 --> 00:02:17,537
trying to find
somebody to fill in.

57
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:19,038
Well, Donny, if you're
looking for someone

58
00:02:19,038 --> 00:02:20,607
to throw you an
appropriate shindig,

59
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:22,909
I'd be willing
to volunteer.

60
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:25,145
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

61
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,946
Thank you, no.
It's okay.

62
00:02:26,946 --> 00:02:28,314
I just don't
want to impose.

63
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:29,649
It's no trouble
at all, really.

64
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:30,950
No, no, no, no. No.

65
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,485
It's fine, uh, really.

66
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:33,987
Thanks for the offer,
though, Frasier.
(doorbell rings)

67
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:36,322
I don't think we're talking
about the same kind of party.

68
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:38,158
Donny, if you're
letting my reputation

69
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,160
as an aesthete
cloud your judgment,

70
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,163
I assure you I am just
one of the guys...

71
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:46,666
capable of getting down and
dirty with the best of them.

72
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,168
Your jacket, Dr. Crane.

73
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:49,669
Oh, dear God!

74
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:50,670
You never
fold cashmere!

75
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,472
You'll misdirect
the nap. Get out!

76
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:55,942
Donny, give it
some thought, hmm?

77
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:03,650
Morning, Roz.
Hey, Frasier.

78
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:05,151
Help me decide
something.

79
00:03:05,151 --> 00:03:07,153
All right.

80
00:03:07,153 --> 00:03:08,655
I'm thinking about
getting my eyes done.

81
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:10,156
It's a little
expensive, but...

82
00:03:10,156 --> 00:03:11,124
Now, now, Roz,

83
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:12,592
cosmetic surgery
is a drastic step.

84
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:14,594
If you're worried about
those bags under your eyes,

85
00:03:14,594 --> 00:03:16,029
why don't you try
just a different concealer.

86
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:19,032
Perhaps a good night's sleep
once in a while.

87
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,466
I meant the laser procedure

88
00:03:20,466 --> 00:03:23,803
so I could see
without my contacts.

89
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:26,005
Uh, my usual, please.

90
00:03:26,005 --> 00:03:28,508
I just saw the most
incredible thing.

91
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:29,876
You will not believe it.

92
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,578
What is it?
You have to see it
for yourself.

93
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:32,912
Mere words cannot...

94
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:33,880
Ooh, new jacket?

95
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,881
Yes, just came today.

96
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:35,915
That's nice stitching.

97
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:36,916
Thank you.
Christophe.
No, really?

98
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:37,884
Is something
wrong with the nap?

99
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,385
Oh, my God,
is it that obvious?

100
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:40,420
Would you
knock it off?

101
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,421
What is so amazing?

102
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:42,822
All right, come here,
come here, look.

103
00:03:44,757 --> 00:03:46,759
Come here. All right.

104
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:47,760
You see that rotund woman

105
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,262
coming out of
Choc Full of Donuts?

106
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:50,563
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.

107
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:52,332
Watch. Before
she gets to her car,

108
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:53,333
she will finish
that bear claw,

109
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:54,834
and then go back in.

110
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:57,770
This is her third time.

111
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:59,739
That's what you brought
us over here for?

112
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:03,042
To gawk as some poor woman's
struggle with junk food?

113
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:04,844
Big deal, so
she's overweight.

114
00:04:04,844 --> 00:04:06,346
You don't need
to point it out.

115
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:07,247
It's rude.

116
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,114
It's childish.

117
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:09,616
It's Maris.

118
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:15,622
(laughs):
No way.

119
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:17,123
Dear God,
are you sure?

120
00:04:17,123 --> 00:04:18,458
I'm positive.

121
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:19,826
It's hard to believe
that's the same frail woman

122
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:21,327
who once sprained her wrist

123
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:24,297
from having too much dip
on a cracker.

124
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:25,765
Maris was always
chubby as a child.

125
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:27,267
Her whole life
she's been obsessed

126
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,768
with keeping weight off.

127
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:30,270
Something
must've snapped.

128
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,272
Literally. When she saw me,
she swallowed

129
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,774
and her necklace exploded
from the pressure.

130
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:38,044
Look, look,

131
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:40,413
there she goes...
back for more.

132
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:42,749
You know, when I last
saw her at Christmas,

133
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:45,752
she was her
usual tiny self.

134
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:47,186
Wait, Niles,

135
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:48,588
wasn't that about the time

136
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:50,089
you started dating
her plastic surgeon?

137
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:52,058
Actually, it was.

138
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:54,093
You think that could
have triggered

139
00:04:54,093 --> 00:04:55,561
some sort of binge?
Well...

140
00:04:55,561 --> 00:04:57,063
Well, this isn't
going to help.

141
00:04:57,063 --> 00:04:58,998
Mel and I are in the
society page today.

142
00:04:58,998 --> 00:05:01,301
It's our picture at
the symphony benefit.

143
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,102
I shudder to think how Maris
will react to that.

144
00:05:03,102 --> 00:05:05,038
You know how petty and jealous
she can get.

145
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:07,507
They never take a photo of me,

146
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:09,475
and I'm in
the Conductor's Circle.

147
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:12,478
Well, she moved next door
to the Italian deli.

148
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:15,481
The guy just took the two-foot
salami out of the window.

149
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:17,984
I can't face her now.

150
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,485
That salami string
should keep her busy

151
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:20,987
until I can get to my car.

152
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:21,821
Niles...

153
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,690
Hey, is that Niles
in the paper?

154
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:25,558
Yes. He just happened
to have a copy with him.

155
00:05:25,558 --> 00:05:27,560
As if anyone cares about
such trivial matters.

156
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,828
Oh, yeah, right.

157
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:30,096
This is eating you up.

158
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:33,099
You live for this
hoity-toity crap.

159
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:34,600
Thank you.
I certainly do not.

160
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,002
Why does everyone
think that?

161
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:38,404
You know, just this morning
Donny said I was too fussy

162
00:05:38,404 --> 00:05:40,306
to throw him
a bachelor party.

163
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:42,175
Well, you do give off
kind of a fussy vibe.

164
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,477
You know, there are other
sides to my personality.

165
00:05:44,477 --> 00:05:45,745
I remember back
in my Boston days,

166
00:05:45,745 --> 00:05:48,247
I had a regular bar
and a regular barstool.

167
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:49,649
I even had a tab.

168
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:53,453
Well, if you go back,
you should try having a beer.

169
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:55,822
Oh, gosh, you know, maybe...

170
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:58,224
maybe I have become stuffier.

171
00:05:58,224 --> 00:05:59,625
The highlight of my week

172
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:01,961
was the arrival
of my hand-tailored coat.

173
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:03,863
Maybe it's time
I loosened up a bit.

174
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:06,833
Tried to tone down the
whole fuddy-duddy image.

175
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:11,337
Hello, Donny?
It's Frasier.

176
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:13,339
Listen, I would really
like to throw

177
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:15,274
that bachelor party for you.

178
00:06:15,274 --> 00:06:17,143
No, no, I assure you
I know

179
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:18,578
what goes on at one.

180
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:20,580
Yes, I'm quite, quite qualified.

181
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,081
No, really, I promise you

182
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:24,584
a night of such
unrepentant debauchery

183
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:28,588
that the mere memory will
delight you in your old age.

184
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:30,590
That is, if you should
survive the night.

185
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,091
(laughing)

186
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:33,493
Think I'm overselling it a bit?

187
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:35,862
Maybe a tad.
Yeah, all right.

188
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:36,896
That's great.
Oh, great, great.

189
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,197
Thanks, Donny.

190
00:06:38,197 --> 00:06:39,499
I'll tell you
what I'm going to do,

191
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:41,501
I'm going to go out
and find you a stripper.

192
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:44,003
Maybe even more than one.

193
00:06:44,003 --> 00:06:45,004
You bet.

194
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:46,005
(laughing)

195
00:06:47,473 --> 00:06:48,941
Strippers, huh?

196
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:49,876
You betcha.

197
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:53,613
A couple of real
red-hot mamas.

198
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:55,882
You don't even know where
to find one, do you?

199
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:57,750
Not a clue.

200
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:03,823
(footsteps, coins jingling)

201
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:11,330
(coins clattering)

202
00:07:20,673 --> 00:07:22,942
Damn.

203
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,243
Damn.

204
00:07:24,243 --> 00:07:25,745
Damn!

205
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:27,747
Damn.

206
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:31,250
Open, damn you!

207
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,084
Frasier?

208
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:34,454
Regan.

209
00:07:35,888 --> 00:07:38,191
Well, this is certainly my lucky
day running into you twice.

210
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:42,628
Gosh, I guess
this must look a little strange.

211
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:44,864
Really, it's none
of my business.

212
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:46,699
No, no, actually, it's
quite an amusing story.

213
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:49,202
I was just getting
a Seattle Timeshere

214
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:52,071
and I got my coat
stuck in the machine.

215
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:53,773
That's not the Seattle Times.

216
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:54,574
Hmm?

217
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:56,075
(gasps)

218
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:59,078
Dear God, they should label
these things more clearly.

219
00:07:59,078 --> 00:08:01,981
This is some sort of a smut rag.

220
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:03,850
It was nice seeing you.
Regan...

221
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:05,885
Regan...

222
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:07,887
Regan...

223
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:12,325
Well, if you get any in,

224
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,359
could you
please call me?

225
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:15,294
Thank you.

226
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:16,796
Gosh, I'm off
to one hell of a start

227
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:18,297
with this bachelor party.

228
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:19,799
First, the debacle with Regan,

229
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:20,800
now Syd's Novelty Shop

230
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,303
is completely out
of naughty coasters.

231
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:26,272
Oh, will you stop moping.

232
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:29,175
It'll all work ass.

233
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,877
What?

234
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:33,179
For God's sake,
give me that!

235
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,615
What the hell
are you doing?

236
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:37,016
DONNY:
Honey, if your
head hurts,

237
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:37,850
we don't have to go.

238
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,285
No, no.
I'll be fine.

239
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:40,286
All right.

240
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:42,288
Dr. Crane, I just want
to tell you how happy I am

241
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:43,789
you're throwing
Donny's bachelor party.

242
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:44,790
Oh, well, there,

243
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,259
you see?

244
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:47,126
At least someone thinks

245
00:08:47,126 --> 00:08:48,461
I'm capable of throwing
a proper...

246
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:49,462
A nice, low-key party

247
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:51,297
just like my honey-bunny
insisted.

248
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:52,598
DAPHNE:
Honestly,

249
00:08:52,598 --> 00:08:54,600
why men have
to celebrate
getting married

250
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,035
by having
bouncing bosoms

251
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,436
shoved in
their faces...

252
00:08:57,436 --> 00:08:58,437
Yeah. Just...

253
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:01,941
If I know Dr. Crane,

254
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:03,442
your party will be over
by 9:30.

255
00:09:03,442 --> 00:09:06,445
Oh, we could all go out
for dinner afterwards.

256
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:10,216
Oh, yeah,
that'd be swell, honey.

257
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,818
Gosh, you know,
if Daphne is so down

258
00:09:12,818 --> 00:09:14,153
on this whole
bachelor party idea,

259
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:16,155
maybe I should throw
a more sedate one.

260
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:17,590
I don't want to get Donny
in trouble.

261
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:20,026
Listen, your job is to give him
the party he wants.

262
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:21,527
Everything else
is between them.

263
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:25,498
It's absolutely
none of your boobs.

264
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:33,773
Give me that!

265
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:35,274
Stop that.

266
00:09:35,274 --> 00:09:36,275
(doorbell rings)

267
00:09:36,275 --> 00:09:37,743
(sighs)

268
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,114
Oh.

269
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:43,482
Frasier Crane?

270
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:44,817
Yes?

271
00:09:44,817 --> 00:09:48,721
I'm looking into a report
of vandalism...

272
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:53,225
of a newspaper vending machine
on Euclid Avenue.

273
00:09:53,225 --> 00:09:54,226
Does that sound familiar?

274
00:09:54,226 --> 00:09:55,227
Well, I-I may
have been

275
00:09:55,227 --> 00:09:56,729
in the area earlier
today, but, um...

276
00:09:56,729 --> 00:10:00,733
Somebody on the
scene recognized you

277
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:02,101
as the perpetrator.

278
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,403
Are you aware of the
penalty for vandalism?

279
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:06,238
Uh-oh.
Well, I...
I may have

280
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:07,540
dented the machine
a little, but...

281
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:10,443
Frasier Crane, you have
the right to remain...

282
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,311
aroused.

283
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:15,214
(evocative music playing)
Anything you see,

284
00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:19,385
can and will be
rubbed against you.

285
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:23,889
She's a stripper!

286
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:25,524
I get it, Dad!

287
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:27,360
Thank you.

288
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,861
Thank you, Officer.

289
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:31,364
I-I knew that Daphne
was going to be gone

290
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:32,698
most of the afternoon,

291
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:34,533
so I figured I'd help you out.

292
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:36,035
Boy, you hire her
for Donny's party,

293
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:38,004
he'll put you in his will.

294
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:40,339
So...

295
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:41,140
do I get the job?

296
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,575
Well, you...

297
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:44,977
you certainly seem qualified...
overqualified.

298
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:47,179
What's going on?

299
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:48,447
Oh, Daphne!

300
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:51,450
Oh, hello, I-I...
this is, uh...

301
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:55,154
Officer Nasty, uh...

302
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,624
She's, uh, leaving
the police force,

303
00:10:58,624 --> 00:11:00,893
and, uh, I'm thinking
of hiring her

304
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:01,627
as the housekeeper.

305
00:11:01,627 --> 00:11:03,129
You see,
once you marry Donny,

306
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:04,997
you'll still be Dad's
physical therapist

307
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:06,599
of course, but
we'll need someone

308
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:08,434
around here to do
the chores, won't we?

309
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:10,302
Weren't you
supposed to be
out with Donny today?

310
00:11:10,302 --> 00:11:12,438
Yeah, I was, but I've got
a splitting headache.

311
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:13,839
Oh.

312
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,841
So, how long have you been
on the force?

313
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:16,842
Uh, you know, uh,

314
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:18,844
I was just about
to-to show the officer

315
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:20,846
around the house
and, uh, discuss terms.

316
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:22,348
(doorbell rings)

317
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,850
All right, it was nice meeting
you, Officer Nasty.

318
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,152
Yes.

319
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:31,624
Don't tell me
to calm down!

320
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:33,626
It's a complete
disaster.

321
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:34,627
She'll ruin me!

322
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:36,095
What's going on?
Oh, it's Maris.

323
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:37,096
She saw the picture
of us today,

324
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:39,098
and she's determined
to take it out on Mel.

325
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:41,100
Yes. She's telling everyone

326
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,069
that I caused her weight gain

327
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:45,504
by nicking her thyroid
during a neck tuck.

328
00:11:45,504 --> 00:11:49,241
I've already had
three cancellations.

329
00:11:49,241 --> 00:11:51,577
She never thinks about
anybody but herself.

330
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:52,912
Daphne, get me
a cup of tea.

331
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:57,083
Actually, I have a bit
of a headache.

332
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,951
Oh, you could
be coming down
with something.

333
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:00,886
Wash your hands first.

334
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:04,090
NILES:
Darling, you have got
to calm down.

335
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:05,357
Your shoulders
are so tense.

336
00:12:05,357 --> 00:12:07,326
Oh, you know, Daphne gives
a wonderful massage.

337
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:09,595
That might be
just the thing for you.

338
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:12,164
Actually, I was
planning on
taking a nap.

339
00:12:12,164 --> 00:12:14,233
Oh, good, so
you're not busy.

340
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:15,968
Shall we do it
in your room?

341
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:16,836
Look, you two
run along.

342
00:12:16,836 --> 00:12:18,337
I'll take care
of the tea.

343
00:12:18,337 --> 00:12:19,839
I really appreciate
this, Daphne.

344
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,640
You're welcome,
Dr. Crane.

345
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,908
Hey, Niles.

346
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:23,909
What?

347
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:26,779
Guess what
your brother's doing.

348
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:28,614
Pressing his new blazer?

349
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:32,585
Yeah. Against a stripper.

350
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,053
What?

351
00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:35,020
Yes!

352
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,455
He's interviewing her
in his room

353
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:37,456
for Donny's bachelor party,

354
00:12:37,456 --> 00:12:38,858
but don't tell Daphne.

355
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:40,659
And how exactly do you interview
a stripper?

356
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:42,128
I don't know,

357
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:44,930
but I bet there's a real show
going on in there.

358
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,198
If you keep the gun
in its holster

359
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:47,700
until the very
end, you see,

360
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,068
that way your act

361
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:51,937
has, you know, more, uh...
impact, shall we say.

362
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:55,307
Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

363
00:12:55,307 --> 00:12:58,144
Men seem to like my act
the way it is.

364
00:12:58,144 --> 00:13:00,079
Oh, well, I certainly
can't tell you about
attracting men,

365
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:03,549
but I do know a thing or
two about showmanship.

366
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:06,418
Tell me, uh, what sort
of encore do you have?

367
00:13:06,418 --> 00:13:07,753
I don't have an encore.

368
00:13:07,753 --> 00:13:09,054
Trust me.

369
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:11,857
With this act, we're
going to need one.

370
00:13:11,857 --> 00:13:13,292
Um, I have an idea.

371
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,194
Well, Mel's all set up
with Daphne.

372
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:17,263
Oh, well, maybe we ought
to tell Frasier

373
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:19,765
this is a good time
to get that stripper

374
00:13:19,765 --> 00:13:21,267
out of here.

375
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:22,201
Dad?

376
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:23,669
Oh, Fras, okay, coast is clear.

377
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:24,970
Everything's fine.

378
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,740
Not exactly.

379
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:35,014
How did that happen?

380
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:36,415
Lord of the Dance here

381
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:38,851
decided I needed
an encore.

382
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:43,589
Well, I assumed
you had the key.

383
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:44,590
I never use them!

384
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,559
Oh... all right, we'll
just have to cut them off.

385
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:48,360
All right, well,
come on in here.

386
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,830
I'm Niles.

387
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:54,366
Now, you might come
to a point

388
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:57,169
where it feels like
you can't take it anymore.

389
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:59,004
I call that "phase one."

390
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:01,373
(Mel groans)

391
00:14:01,373 --> 00:14:03,709
Are you sure
you know what you're doing?

392
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:05,644
I know exactly
what I'm doing.

393
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:09,648
(yells)

394
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:11,150
Oh.

395
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,151
Just relax.

396
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:14,954
Oh, this is all
Maris' fault.

397
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:18,290
You know, she actually
called me and said she'd...

398
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:20,593
lay off if I'd stop seeing him.

399
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:21,894
What'd you say?

400
00:14:21,894 --> 00:14:23,829
Well, I hung up on her.

401
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:25,264
How insane is this woman?

402
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:28,767
She thinks I'd give up Niles
to protect my practice?

403
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:29,735
I'm crazy about him.

404
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:31,203
The way he laughs,

405
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:34,206
the way he gets that
little glint in his eye

406
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:37,009
when he's about to say
something clever...

407
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:39,345
But you know what
I love the most?

408
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:41,347
It's like there are
all these things

409
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:44,850
that he could be
if he could just
trust someone enough

410
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:46,785
to help him
unlock it all, and...

411
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:48,721
if I could be
that person--

412
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:51,724
you know, that safe
person in his life--

413
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,225
well, the more
I know him

414
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:56,228
the more I know that's
all I want to be.

415
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:58,597
Daphne?

416
00:14:58,597 --> 00:15:03,402
Oh...

417
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:05,838
Oh!

418
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:06,839
This isn't working, Dad.

419
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:08,841
There's only one thing
left to do.

420
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:09,842
Well, I got
to warn you.

421
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:11,844
I'm not as good a shot
as I used to be,

422
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:13,345
but you'll have to go out
on the balcony.

423
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:15,848
I need a cup of coffee
to steady my nerves!

424
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:17,182
Dad!

425
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:19,919
I meant, go to a locksmith.

426
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:20,853
Oh, thank God.

427
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:22,621
All right,
let's go.
Come on.

428
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:23,923
Oh, wait, hold on.

429
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,424
I have to put
something on.

430
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:26,425
(doorbell rings)

431
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:27,927
Wait, wait,
I'll get it.

432
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,428
I'll get it.

433
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:31,931
It's Maris!

434
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,766
At least...

435
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,134
I think it is.

436
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:36,535
You need a bigger peephole.

437
00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:37,970
What on earth

438
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:39,305
is she doing here?

439
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:40,139
I have no idea,

440
00:15:40,572 --> 00:15:41,640
but we can't let her
anywhere near Mel,

441
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:44,476
especially now that Maris
has the weight advantage.

442
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:45,577
(pounding on door)

443
00:15:45,577 --> 00:15:46,812
What are we going to do?

444
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:47,980
Take her into Frasier's room.

445
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:48,714
FRASIER:
Wait, wait!

446
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:49,715
I can't been seen like this.

447
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:51,083
She'll blab it all over town.

448
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:52,451
Get in the bathroom!
Right.

449
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:53,452
I'll call you
when she leaves.

450
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:54,787
Thank you,
Niles.

451
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:06,365
You know, seeing as how
we have a-a minute or two here,

452
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:08,367
I may as well
take this opportunity

453
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:09,835
to end the suspense.

454
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:13,639
You've got the job.

455
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:14,974
I've got a little news
for you, too.

456
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:15,941
Hmm?

457
00:16:15,941 --> 00:16:18,911
I've been on the clock since
you slapped the cuffs on me.

458
00:16:18,911 --> 00:16:21,613
Fair enough.

459
00:16:21,613 --> 00:16:24,450
Ooh. It's
freezing in here.

460
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:26,452
Oh, uh, yes, here,
let me...

461
00:16:26,952 --> 00:16:28,954
I seem to remember
doing this

462
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:33,459
back in my college days
at a fraternity hazing.

463
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:35,461
Here you are.

464
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:36,962
Oh... here you go.

465
00:16:36,962 --> 00:16:38,464
Yeah.

466
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:39,431
(clears throat)

467
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:40,899
Thank you.

468
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:45,838
It's hand-stitched.

469
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,806
MARTIN:
Frasier, come on out.

470
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:49,241
All right,
we're out of here.

471
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:50,642
My God! Have
you seen Maris?!

472
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:52,177
Yes, Dad, I know.

473
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:53,612
Did Niles
calm her down?

474
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:55,080
Yeah, he took her to your room

475
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,482
but he had to
butter her up a little.

476
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:58,684
I was afraid that narrow doorway
might pose a problem.

477
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:01,687
(shrieks)

478
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:02,688
Frasier!

479
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:03,655
Regan.

480
00:17:03,655 --> 00:17:04,690
Hello.

481
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,191
(nervous chuckle)

482
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:07,192
Uh, listen, uh,

483
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:08,961
I'm sorry about
this afternoon, um...

484
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:10,262
Oh, forget about that.

485
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:11,563
It was no big deal.

486
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:12,865
By the way, uh,

487
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,367
I was wondering
if you'd be available to...

488
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,369
Oh, Lord.
Oh!

489
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:23,976
(sighs)

490
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:25,411
Gosh...

491
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:26,412
no need to
be embarrassed

492
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:27,913
about that,
you know?

493
00:17:27,913 --> 00:17:29,782
I do that sort
of thing all
the time.

494
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:31,550
Say, uh...

495
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,885
you were saying?

496
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:33,719
Uh...

497
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:36,055
Yeah, just, uh...

498
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,057
let me get all this
cleaned up first.

499
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,559
Yes, uh...

500
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:49,301
There you go.

501
00:17:49,301 --> 00:17:51,236
You know,
I-I'd gladly
have helped you,

502
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:53,205
it's just that
I've-I've hurt my back.

503
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:54,706
You see, oh...
oh, gosh, oh!

504
00:17:54,706 --> 00:17:56,108
Oh, it's seizing up again.

505
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:57,309
You know,

506
00:17:57,309 --> 00:17:59,144
maybe it would be best
if I just...

507
00:17:59,144 --> 00:18:01,480
went back inside
and crawled into bed.

508
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,615
Good night.

509
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:05,918
It's going to be
a moment.

510
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,419
I figured.

511
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:09,421
DAPHNE:
I'm just going to
make us some tea.

512
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:11,723
Back inside!

513
00:18:11,723 --> 00:18:12,558
Frasier!

514
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:15,461
Oh...

515
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:18,864
you're a lucky man
having this woman on your staff.

516
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:20,365
Thank you again,
Daphne.

517
00:18:20,365 --> 00:18:21,366
You're welcome.

518
00:18:21,366 --> 00:18:22,668
Oh.

519
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:24,369
Niles, where are you going
with all that food?

520
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:25,704
Um, Dad is not feeling well

521
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:28,707
so I thought I'd bring him
some comfort food.

522
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:31,210
And, uh, by the way,
if anyone is going out,

523
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:35,214
Dad specifically requested
something called a chalupa.

524
00:18:38,884 --> 00:18:40,385
(doorbell rings)

525
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:44,223
Uh, Daphne, would you mind
getting that?

526
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:45,491
You're not serious?

527
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:47,893
You are on the staff after all.

528
00:18:47,893 --> 00:18:52,364
(Daphne muttering)

529
00:18:52,364 --> 00:18:53,365
Hi, Daphne.

530
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:54,867
Hey, Regan.

531
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:55,667
Come on in.

532
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:57,002
Um...

533
00:18:57,002 --> 00:18:57,970
Oh, Frasier.

534
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,506
I-I was concerned
about your back.

535
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:01,473
You hurt your back?

536
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:03,475
Uh, no, no.
Just a-a-a spasm.

537
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:04,977
See, leaning against the wall
like this,

538
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,745
it actually feels a lot better.

539
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:08,046
Is it upper back
or lower?

540
00:19:08,046 --> 00:19:09,047
Uh, middle,
actually.

541
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:11,049
If you could all
just leave me alone.

542
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:12,384
Really, I'm fine
right here.

543
00:19:12,384 --> 00:19:14,419
Why don't we just get you
onto the couch.

544
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:16,221
No, no, no, please, please.
I-I know what I'm doing.

545
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:17,156
We'll each take a side.

546
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,657
No, stop!

547
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,058
No, Frasier, it could
be a thoracic strain.

548
00:19:20,058 --> 00:19:22,194
Or a bulging disc.

549
00:19:22,194 --> 00:19:24,363
Yes, impinging
on your lumbar nerve.

550
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:25,664
Yes, it could easily be
any one of those things,

551
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,666
but did you also consider
that it might be...

552
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:30,669
the stripper
chained to my wrist?

553
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,875
Officer Nasty!

554
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,777
Oh!

555
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:43,348
Everyone, this is Dinah.

556
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:44,650
You see,

557
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:47,085
this all happened
because I was trying to prove

558
00:19:47,085 --> 00:19:48,587
that I'm a-a normal guy

559
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:50,589
capable of doing
normal guy things

560
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:52,524
like throw a bachelor party.

561
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:54,493
And Daphne, Donny didn't know
anything about it,

562
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:56,361
so I wish you'd just
lighten up.

563
00:19:57,596 --> 00:19:59,331
Regan, I-I can't
even imagine

564
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:00,632
where this must put us.

565
00:20:00,632 --> 00:20:02,634
I guess it's time
I just accept the fact

566
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:05,137
that things will never
work out between us.

567
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:06,605
You're certainly
not to blame.

568
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:08,874
After today I...

569
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,175
I can't see that any woman

570
00:20:10,175 --> 00:20:12,477
would even want
to go out with me.

571
00:20:12,477 --> 00:20:15,280
I think... I would.

572
00:20:25,824 --> 00:20:27,392
Hey, Fras.

573
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:29,228
Oh, hi, Dad.

574
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,029
How was your date?

575
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:34,499
Well, it was nice, uh...

576
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:36,501
we had a beer...

577
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:38,003
Mm-hmm.

578
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:39,004
Talked a bit...

579
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:41,506
She has a hell of
a body, doesn't she?

580
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:44,009
(chuckling)

581
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:47,346
Dad, that is not
what this evening was about.

582
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:50,515
This evening was about, uh,
taking a chance...

583
00:20:50,515 --> 00:20:54,219
getting to know
a different sort of woman.

584
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:56,088
Turns out she's really
quite interesting.

585
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,590
Dinah-- she's working her way
through grad school.

586
00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:59,591
She lives with her mother.

587
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:01,093
She's extremely well-read.

588
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,894
She even speaks
a couple of languages.

589
00:21:02,894 --> 00:21:05,197
Mmm. It really makes you
wonder, doesn't it?

590
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:06,598
Yes, it does,
doesn't it?

591
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:08,433
Makes you wonder
about how eager we are

592
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:09,968
to judge a book by its cover.

593
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:12,904
How willing we are
to stereotype each other.

594
00:21:12,904 --> 00:21:14,339
No, I mean it really
makes you wonder

595
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:17,242
what that mother looks like.

596
00:21:26,518 --> 00:21:29,021
♪ Hey, baby,

605
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:50,709
Good night, Seattle!

606
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:52,477
We love you!
