1
00:00:07,874 --> 00:00:08,842
Until tomorrow, then,

2
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:10,744
this is Dr. Frasier Crane

3
00:00:10,744 --> 00:00:11,978
wishing you...

4
00:00:11,978 --> 00:00:12,812
Hmm?

5
00:00:12,812 --> 00:00:14,314
Oh, yes.

6
00:00:14,314 --> 00:00:17,817
Be sure to tune in later
for the final broadcast

7
00:00:17,817 --> 00:00:22,222
of KACL's lovable curmudgeon,
Chester Ludgate.

8
00:00:22,222 --> 00:00:24,591
You know, most of us
here at the station

9
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:27,127
were surprised to hear
that he was retiring.

10
00:00:27,127 --> 00:00:29,629
I, for one,
thought he'd never leave.

11
00:00:29,629 --> 00:00:31,131
(sighs)

12
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:32,632
So, should we
order a pizza?

13
00:00:32,632 --> 00:00:34,100
Hmm? Sorry?

14
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,603
Those PSAs
you promised you'd help me with

15
00:00:36,603 --> 00:00:37,570
are due tomorrow.

16
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:39,572
Oh, gosh, Roz,
I really am sorry.

17
00:00:39,572 --> 00:00:41,574
You know, it seems
Mrs. Delafield's daughter

18
00:00:41,574 --> 00:00:43,943
is coming here
to join us as an intern.

19
00:00:43,943 --> 00:00:46,646
I promised Kenny
I'd show her around
and take her to dinner.

20
00:00:46,646 --> 00:00:48,048
Oh, so while I'm working late,

21
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:49,049
eating my vending machine
dinner,

22
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:51,885
you'll be out having a gourmet
meal with some cute, rich girl?

23
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:53,720
Oh, you can make anything
sound unfair.

24
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:56,056
Hey, Doc.

25
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:57,490
Kenny.

26
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:58,825
And whom have we here?

27
00:00:58,825 --> 00:00:59,692
Dr. Frasier Crane,

28
00:00:59,692 --> 00:01:02,062
I'd like you to meet
Miss Poppy Delafield.

29
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:04,164
Well, got to run.

30
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:05,598
Poppy.

31
00:01:05,598 --> 00:01:06,633
What a pleasure

32
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:08,535
to meet the daughter
of our beloved

33
00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:09,936
station owner.

34
00:01:09,936 --> 00:01:11,171
Well... so,

35
00:01:11,171 --> 00:01:12,972
what brings you to KACL, hmm?

36
00:01:12,972 --> 00:01:13,840
Well...

37
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,241
I was in Paris last month--

38
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:17,744
or was it Madrid? No. Paris--
and I said to myself

39
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:20,246
"that's enough gallivanting
for you, young lady.

40
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:21,548
"It's time you get a job."

41
00:01:21,548 --> 00:01:24,184
So, I flew home
and asked my mother, Mummy,

42
00:01:24,184 --> 00:01:26,986
if I could nose around
and see if some job, you know,

43
00:01:26,986 --> 00:01:29,489
spoke to me at one
of her TV stations

44
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:31,291
or radio stations
or newspapers

45
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:33,893
but not her brewery--
thank you very much!

46
00:01:33,893 --> 00:01:36,096
So, here I am.

47
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:36,996
Uh-huh.

48
00:01:36,996 --> 00:01:38,865
Sleeves rolled up,
ready to learn.

49
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:39,666
Well, good for you.

50
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:41,234
Is this where
you do your show?!

51
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:42,235
Yes, it is...
Of course it is.

52
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:43,736
There's your mike
right in front of me.

53
00:01:43,736 --> 00:01:46,606
Earth to Poppy!

54
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:47,941
Oh, there's Gil.

55
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:48,942
I met him earlier.

56
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,443
Hi, Gil!

57
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:52,245
Hey...
Um...

58
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:53,580
Nice man.

59
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,483
I think it's marvelous
what you do--

60
00:01:56,483 --> 00:01:57,984
to really help people,

61
00:01:57,984 --> 00:02:00,487
unlike the psychiatrists
I've been to,

62
00:02:00,487 --> 00:02:03,790
both of whom had some sort of--
I don't know-- narcolepsy.

63
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,859
I sympathize.

64
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:08,027
But if you can't stay awake,
don't be a psychiatrist!

65
00:02:08,027 --> 00:02:09,329
But to do what you do,

66
00:02:09,829 --> 00:02:12,332
to face that microphone
day after day

67
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:14,834
and know that
for the next three hours

68
00:02:14,834 --> 00:02:18,338
you're going to have
to talk and talk and talk...

69
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:20,340
I could not do it!

70
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,841
I would freeze!

71
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:23,343
Literally freeze!

72
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:24,844
(phone ringing)
I mean...

73
00:02:24,844 --> 00:02:25,845
Excuse me.

74
00:02:25,845 --> 00:02:27,147
Hello?

75
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:27,914
Yes.

76
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:29,449
Yes, Dad.

77
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:31,451
All right, all right,
calm down, calm down.

78
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:32,452
Was there much blood?

79
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:33,453
Oh, my gosh!

80
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:35,188
All right, Dad,
I'll be there

81
00:02:35,188 --> 00:02:36,990
as soon as I can.
Hang on a second.

82
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,992
I'm terribly sorry.
There's a small
emergency at home.

83
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,493
I'm going to have
to pass on dinner.

84
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:41,761
May I take a rain check?

85
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:43,396
Oh, and we were having
such a nice chat.

86
00:02:43,396 --> 00:02:44,230
Yes, well, I...

87
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:46,766
Oh, this is Roz Doyle,
my producer.

88
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:49,235
You know, Roz,
I'll gladly
do those promos

89
00:02:49,235 --> 00:02:51,704
if you would be so kind
as to take Poppy to dinner

90
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:52,672
and answer her questions.

91
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:54,674
Sure! If you
don't get bored

92
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,176
listening to me
drone on about radio.

93
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:59,946
Oh, I don't think
there's much chance of that.

94
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,086
Eddie, come on, get in here.

95
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:10,390
What the hell's happening?

96
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,791
Well...

97
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:13,626
remember last week
when Eddie killed his first rat

98
00:03:13,626 --> 00:03:15,161
how proud I was?
I told you that story, right?

99
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:16,563
Yes, Dad,
you told us.

100
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:19,432
If you'd had a guitar,
you'd have written a ballad.

101
00:03:19,432 --> 00:03:21,201
Well, we were just

102
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,036
down in the basement,
and I saw another rat.

103
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,037
I said, "Go get him, boy."

104
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,539
So, just as he picked him up,
had him in his teeth,

105
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:27,540
shaking the life out of him,

106
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,475
I hear this little bell
tinkling.

107
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:30,877
And I thought,
"Well, that's funny.

108
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:33,246
Rats don't wear bells."

109
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:35,048
Oh, my God, little Robbie
Greenberg's missing hamster.

110
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,616
Yes, I read that flyer.

111
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:38,484
He was offering
a ten-dollar reward.

112
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:41,354
Well, the most we can claim
at this point is about $6.50.

113
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:43,856
Oh, my! You know what?

114
00:03:43,856 --> 00:03:46,226
Dad, this is actually
your fault, you know.

115
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,094
If you hadn't encouraged him
after he killed his first rat,

116
00:03:48,094 --> 00:03:50,063
he wouldn't have moved on
to murdering hamsters.

117
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:50,997
Well, what are you
talking about?

118
00:03:51,497 --> 00:03:52,498
We don't know
it was Eddie who killed him.

119
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:53,499
He might have
had a heart attack

120
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:55,401
or-or some kind
of seizure

121
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:57,303
when he bounced off
the boiler.

122
00:03:57,303 --> 00:03:59,305
(doorbells rings)
(groans)

123
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:01,407
Niles.

124
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:03,443
Prepare to whoop
like a sweepstakes winner.

125
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:04,444
Cancel our dinner.

126
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:06,446
I've scored us two seats,
front row,

127
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:07,847
for the event of the season.

128
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:09,048
You mean...?
Yes!
But...

129
00:04:09,048 --> 00:04:10,783
I know.
Niles!

130
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:12,185
I love it
when they do it this way.

131
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:14,988
I can pretend
it's a Seahawks game.

132
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:17,790
My God! No, Dad!

133
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:20,226
It's for
the Cecilia Bartoli concert.

134
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:21,227
My God, it's been sold out
for months!

135
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:23,229
How on earth did you ever score
these tickets?

136
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:24,697
I simply phoned
the box office

137
00:04:24,697 --> 00:04:26,065
and said, "This
is Niles Crane,

138
00:04:26,065 --> 00:04:28,735
the new arts critic
for The Monocle."

139
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:29,602
(Frasier gasping)

140
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,037
DAPHNE:
The Monocle?

141
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:33,439
Isn't that that magazine
they hand out to rich people

142
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,275
in all the snootiest
apartment buildings?

143
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,110
And the snootiest
hotels.

144
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,044
How did this happen, Niles?

145
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:40,613
I was at a party thrown
by the publisher,

146
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:41,914
Olga Swarbreck.
Mm-hmm, yes.

147
00:04:41,914 --> 00:04:43,216
The pretentious fop

148
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:45,218
who had the job before me
was there, too,

149
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:48,154
spouting sheer drivel
about Leonard Bernstein.

150
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:50,723
Being polite,
I kept my tongue sheathed,

151
00:04:50,723 --> 00:04:53,693
until he referred to Bernstein's
conducting as "overrated."

152
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:54,661
I assume you pounced!

153
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:56,663
Like a ninja!

154
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,602
By the time I'd finished
with him, Olga could see

155
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:05,104
I was a far better critic
than that arrogant poseur.

156
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:06,472
She fired him right there?

157
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:07,840
Well, he was leaving anyway

158
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,142
for his junior year abroad.

159
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:11,411
Well, I suppose

160
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:12,912
that congratulations
are in order.

161
00:05:12,912 --> 00:05:14,280
You know,
who would have thought,

162
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,649
my little brother,
a professional music critic.

163
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:18,518
Oh, oh, and
not just music.

164
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:21,287
I can review anything I want:
Theater, dance, art exhibits.

165
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:23,089
You don't say?
Yes. From now on

166
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:24,457
wherever we go,
I'll be armed

167
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:25,958
with my trusty pad
and pen light.

168
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:27,460
Wherever we go.

169
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,461
What fun!

170
00:05:28,961 --> 00:05:29,962
(chuckling):
Yes.

171
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:31,964
I have to take a damp cloth
to these opera glasses--

172
00:05:31,964 --> 00:05:34,467
although I don't know
what we use them for

173
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:35,468
sitting in the front row.

174
00:05:35,968 --> 00:05:39,439
Unless it's to scan the faces
of the jealous people behind us.

175
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:42,909
So... are
you, uh, sure

176
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:45,411
you're okay with Niles
getting this critic job?

177
00:05:45,411 --> 00:05:47,280
Why wouldn't I be, Dad?

178
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,581
Oh, come on, I know
what it's like with you two

179
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:51,084
when one of you gets something
that the other one doesn't have.

180
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:52,352
It's just like
when you were kids.

181
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,586
Niles had a telescope,

182
00:05:53,586 --> 00:05:55,121
you had to have
a telescope.

183
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:57,056
You got that
funny-looking guitar,

184
00:05:57,056 --> 00:05:58,925
Niles had...
Dad, it was called a lute.

185
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:00,727
Yeah, oh, yeah. Okay.

186
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:04,097
Dad, believe me, I do not envy
Niles his critic's job.

187
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:06,432
But as kids, we
would aggravate
the situation

188
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:08,301
by flaunting our toys
in each other's faces.

189
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:10,737
We're much more mature
than that now. All right?

190
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:12,171
Niles, you know what?

191
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:13,172
It's about time we got going.

192
00:06:13,172 --> 00:06:14,674
We don't want to be late
for the curtain.

193
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:16,175
Don't be silly.
I'm press now.

194
00:06:16,175 --> 00:06:18,177
They'll hold it.

195
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:29,122
POPPY:
So, that's how it ends.

196
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:31,124
B-minus average,
ten extra pounds

197
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:32,992
and still no boyfriend!

198
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:35,895
I see Poppy's having
a little party.

199
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,864
That is not a party.

200
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:40,400
That's a hostage situation.

201
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,902
Thank God
today is her last day.

202
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:43,903
You know, this morning

203
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,905
she cornered me
by the coffee machine

204
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,407
and told me
her whole life story.

205
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,909
I just wanted
to grab her by the throat

206
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,377
and say, "What am I,
your biographer?

207
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:52,712
Shut up!"

208
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:54,280
GIL:
Dear God!

209
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,548
I thought I'd never break free.

210
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:59,485
I feel like a mongoose
at the mercy of a chatty cobra.

211
00:07:03,022 --> 00:07:04,524
Oh! Hello, all.

212
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:07,026
I... oh, I see you
already have the Times.

213
00:07:07,026 --> 00:07:08,961
I'm quoted there today.

214
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:10,730
In the Times?

215
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,899
Yes. Here, it's in this ad
for Shaw's Saint Joan.

216
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:14,300
"Incandescent.

217
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,802
Niles Crane,The Monocle."

218
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:17,003
ROZ:
Wow!

219
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:18,371
Excuse me while I go tell

220
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:20,373
all my friends I know you.

221
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:22,375
(chuckling)

222
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:23,376
Oh...

223
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:24,377
(yawning)

224
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:25,378
Forgive me.

225
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:26,379
Hmm.

226
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:28,314
Olga and I
were up till all hours

227
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:29,715
at a party for
the Royal Shakespeare Company.

228
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:35,521
I'm rubbing some pretty
impressive shoulders these days.

229
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:41,160
And to think, it's all
because I have a small column.

230
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:44,096
That would certainly be
the Freudian interpretation.

231
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,069
If I were to review
that attitude,

232
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:52,839
I'd say it was a chilling
portrait of malice and envy.

233
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:54,640
Oh, Niles,
I'm not the least bit envious

234
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,109
that you get to spout off
in that glorified cat box liner.

235
00:07:57,109 --> 00:08:01,514
You just can't stand it that my
opinion means more than yours--

236
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:03,316
that the arts community
looks to me

237
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:06,586
for my insight, my approval,
my thumbs up.

238
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:09,388
I think we both know
what your thumb's up these days.

239
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,291
That's a good one, Frasier.

240
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:14,794
Perhaps you should use it
in your column.

241
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:16,662
Oh, that's right,
you don't have one!

242
00:08:20,032 --> 00:08:23,069
That smug jackass!

243
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:25,571
Frasier, you have
a radio show.

244
00:08:25,571 --> 00:08:27,073
If you wanted to say what
you thought of a play,

245
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:28,074
who's stopping you?

246
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:31,077
It's not the same thing
as being a real critic, Roz.

247
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:33,579
You don't get free tickets.

248
00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:35,081
You don't get quoted.

249
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:37,083
Forget hobnobbing.

250
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:39,085
My God,
this competition

251
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:41,587
between you and your
brother is sick.

252
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:43,055
Your obsessive one-up manship.

253
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:45,057
You're both going to end up

254
00:08:45,057 --> 00:08:47,360
bitter, old cranks
like Chester Ludgate.

255
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,161
You do raise
a good point, Roz.
Thank you.

256
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:50,162
Chester's time slot
is free.

257
00:08:50,162 --> 00:08:52,598
I could do
my own arts show.

258
00:08:52,598 --> 00:08:54,066
Yes. Kenny, Kenny.

259
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:57,069
Listen, Roz just had
the most wonderful idea.

260
00:08:57,069 --> 00:08:58,371
Yeah, Doc?

261
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,673
What do you say
about yours truly

262
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:02,708
hosting a...
a bouncy little show

263
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,610
about the arts in Seattle?

264
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:06,979
Culture...

265
00:09:07,513 --> 00:09:09,015
Wow.

266
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:11,017
Oh, it-it's a great idea.

267
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:13,986
Let me chew on that, and I'll,
uh, I'll get back to you.

268
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:15,454
Great! You see, Roz?

269
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:16,455
He loved your idea.

270
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:17,456
That was not
my idea.

271
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:18,457
It was, too, your idea.

272
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:19,725
It was not...
Doc?

273
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,027
I feel kind of bad
about what I just did.

274
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:22,995
I, uh, I let you think
that there was a chance

275
00:09:22,995 --> 00:09:24,530
that I might let you
do this culture show

276
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:28,501
and, uh, there's not.

277
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:30,970
No chance at all?

278
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:32,438
No.

279
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:33,439
Oh.

280
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,407
I mean,

281
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:35,841
come on, Doc.

282
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:36,876
You, culture, opera.

283
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:38,377
Who's listening?

284
00:09:38,377 --> 00:09:39,345
(chuckling)

285
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:40,346
Not me!

286
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:46,252
Damn! I think

287
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,687
my show's a good idea.

288
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:49,655
Kenny's the station
manager, and he doesn't.

289
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:51,657
Yes, you know, frankly,
i didn't like his attitude.

290
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:54,660
He acts like he owns
the station, but he doesn't.

291
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,028
Someone else does.

292
00:09:56,028 --> 00:09:56,796
Poppy!

293
00:09:56,796 --> 00:09:57,730
The next best thing.

294
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:58,631
Her mother!

295
00:09:58,631 --> 00:09:59,999
No. Poppy!
Oh, right.

296
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:01,467
Hi, Frasier!

297
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:02,969
Hello, Poppy.

298
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:04,870
Gosh, would you care to join me?

299
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,706
Oh, I can't.
Mummy's taking me shopping.

300
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:08,174
She spoils me
something horrible.

301
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:10,610
I guess
it's an only-child thing.

302
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,979
Anything I want,
i just have to ask.

303
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:14,347
Anything you want?

304
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:15,848
Oh, well,
isn't that interesting.

305
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:18,351
You know, Poppy, perhaps, um,
we could, uh,

306
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:20,820
join each other for lunch
after your shopping spree.

307
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,254
I'd love it!

308
00:10:22,254 --> 00:10:23,723
Would you really?
It seems a shame

309
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:25,157
you leaving the station

310
00:10:25,157 --> 00:10:27,126
and us never having really
gotten to know one another.

311
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:28,628
Oh, it hasn't been easy--

312
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:31,631
i mean, with your having those
dental appointments every day.

313
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:32,898
Oh, yes.

314
00:10:32,898 --> 00:10:35,935
Well, you know,
let me walk you out.

315
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:37,203
I should get
the name of your dentist.

316
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:38,704
I can't find one I like.

317
00:10:38,704 --> 00:10:40,706
They're always giving me
Novocain when I don't need it

318
00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:42,708
and then it's hours
before I can talk again.

319
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:45,211
Oh, yes, well...
I could give you his number

320
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:48,214
although I'm not sure
he'd be any different.

321
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:55,588
(symphonic music ending)

322
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:58,424
Divine Beethoven.

323
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:00,426
It's extraordinary, isn't it?

324
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:02,194
Ah, yes.

325
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:04,430
And you know what makes it
even more amazing?

326
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:05,865
What?

327
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:09,235
He was deaf!

328
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:18,077
Daphne, uh...
more pate, please.

329
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:28,721
Poppy, I-I can't tell
you how wonderful it is

330
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:33,092
to meet someone who shares
my passion for the arts.

331
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:35,628
It's a rare thing to find
in Seattle,

332
00:11:35,628 --> 00:11:36,595
believe me.
Is it?

333
00:11:36,595 --> 00:11:38,531
Oh, yes, sadly.

334
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,966
If only more people
were better informed

335
00:11:40,966 --> 00:11:44,036
about our city's
rich cultural treasures.

336
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:50,509
Ah... but what can we,
as mere radio folk, do?

337
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:51,911
Well...

338
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:58,784
What about...
a radio show

339
00:11:58,784 --> 00:12:01,287
all about the arts
in Seattle?

340
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:04,757
Oh, my God, Poppy,
that's a wonderful idea!

341
00:12:04,757 --> 00:12:06,258
How do you do it?

342
00:12:06,258 --> 00:12:08,594
You just pull these things
out of the air.

343
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:10,129
Oh, heavens.

344
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:13,432
Of course, we'll have to find
ourselves a proper host.

345
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:14,800
But who?

346
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,168
Well, someone very smart...

347
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:18,170
Oh, indeed.
And cultured...

348
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:20,506
Bien sur.

349
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:22,575
And with a lovely
speaking voice.

350
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:25,311
Oh, I don't think
we need to look too far.

351
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:26,746
Here you go.

352
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,247
It's very rich

353
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:30,649
so don't spread it on too thick.

354
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:33,219
Frasier,

355
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:36,155
I'm so glad
you're on board with this.

356
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:39,558
You know, my only concern is,
will Kenny go for it?

357
00:12:39,558 --> 00:12:41,961
You see,
he's a bit of a philistine.

358
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:43,596
It might be better

359
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,898
if the suggestion came
not actually from us

360
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:49,368
but from... someone else.

361
00:12:49,368 --> 00:12:51,604
Who?

362
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,439
Well, someone with...

363
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:57,710
more authority, power...
influence.

364
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:02,448
Someone older.

365
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:05,618
A woman, perhaps.

366
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:08,521
Your mother.

367
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:10,022
He means your mother.

368
00:13:10,022 --> 00:13:11,457
Oh...

369
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:16,061
Great idea!
I'll call her.

370
00:13:16,061 --> 00:13:17,563
Oh, here, here, use mine.

371
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:20,833
(laughing):
Oh... thank you.

372
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:23,636
Hello, Mummy?

373
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,037
I'm with Frasier Crane,

374
00:13:25,037 --> 00:13:29,842
and we think there should be
an arts show on KACL.

375
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:33,612
But I really like this idea.

376
00:13:34,613 --> 00:13:36,148
So you'll call Kenny

377
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:38,651
and tell him
you want this, okay?

378
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:39,985
Love you, too.

379
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:41,320
Okay, bye.

380
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:44,190
And the first show
should be...?

381
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,691
Why don't we
start tomorrow?

382
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:48,194
But we'll need
something to review.
(gasps)

383
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:50,696
That revival ofA Streetcar
Named Desireopens tonight.

384
00:13:50,696 --> 00:13:52,198
Splendid! Let's
go together.

385
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:55,067
All right... I'll see
you at the theater.

386
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:56,468
(both laughing)

387
00:13:56,468 --> 00:13:57,903
Oh, Poppy...

388
00:13:57,903 --> 00:13:59,872
(baby talk):
Hewwo, widdle Eddie!

389
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:02,741
Did you have
a good walk?!

390
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,679
Actually, we've just been
to the vet's.

391
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,480
I had the cutest little
dog when I was young

392
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:09,982
named Mr. Oops.

393
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:11,984
Every time we took him
to the vet, he...

394
00:14:15,287 --> 00:14:16,822
You took Eddie
to the vet?

395
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:18,190
Is he sick?
MARTIN:
No.

396
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,025
Turns out
the building security camera

397
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:23,863
caught Eddie taking out
Robbie Greenberg's hamster.

398
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,432
So... this
Greenberg kid's

399
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:29,201
trying to make Eddie out
to be some kind of pit bull.

400
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:30,703
He's organizing some petition

401
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,605
to get him banned
from the building.

402
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:34,039
Oh, Dad, that's terrible.

403
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,007
Yeah, it is.

404
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,508
So, uh, I don't know.

405
00:14:36,508 --> 00:14:38,777
I just wanted
everybody to see

406
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:42,481
what a nice, calm,
friendly dog Eddie was.

407
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:43,916
So why'd you take him
to the vet?

408
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:45,684
Tranquilizers.

409
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:48,320
They don't even
work anyway.

410
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,089
I gave Eddie one of those
pills on the ride home.

411
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:51,090
They didn't do
a thing to him.

412
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:52,591
I don't know.

413
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:53,592
I think maybe he
needs something else.

414
00:14:53,592 --> 00:14:55,594
Uh, Mr. Crane...

415
00:14:59,765 --> 00:15:01,533
(doorbell rings)
Looks like
all he needs

416
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:04,536
is a lava lamp
and some sitar music.

417
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:08,540
Niles!

418
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:11,043
Well, uh, I'm glad to see
you're in a better mood.

419
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:13,045
I-I was... hoping you'd lend me

420
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:14,546
your Tennessee
Williams biography.

421
00:15:14,546 --> 00:15:16,448
I have to review that revival
of Street cartonight,

422
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:18,450
and I wanted to throw in
some background stuff.

423
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:19,785
Well,
I'm sorry, Niles.

424
00:15:19,785 --> 00:15:21,620
You know, normally I would,
except that I'm going

425
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,622
to be needing it myself
for my own review.

426
00:15:23,622 --> 00:15:24,924
Oh. Well, in that
case, I'll...

427
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:27,726
Wha...?

428
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:29,528
What?

429
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:31,330
Oh, that's right--
you wouldn't have heard.

430
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:32,831
You see, starting tomorrow,

431
00:15:32,831 --> 00:15:34,700
I'll be doing my own
little arts show on KACL,

432
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,036
twice weekly.

433
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:38,871
You envious reptile.

434
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:40,506
Pate?

435
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:42,341
I achieve one thing,
one tiny distinction

436
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:43,876
you don't have,
and what do you do?

437
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:45,878
You run whining to Kenny
for extra air time.

438
00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:46,812
I did no such thing.

439
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:48,781
No. He went to that
Poppy woman instead.

440
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:49,682
Poppy?

441
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:51,083
Is this a panel discussion?

442
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:52,084
You loathe Poppy.
I do not.

443
00:15:52,584 --> 00:15:54,019
I think she's delightful.
Isn't she?

444
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:56,755
She's an idiot.

445
00:15:56,755 --> 00:15:58,090
You conniving copycat.

446
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:00,059
You have to have
whatever I have.

447
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:01,593
I do not have
what you have.

448
00:16:01,593 --> 00:16:03,529
My audience is twice
as large as yours is.

449
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:05,564
Oh, well, at least
my audience can read.

450
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:07,466
How dare you
review my audience!

451
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:08,834
NILES:
I'll review
whatever I want!

452
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:11,103
I've never seen him
like this--

453
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:12,871
eyes bulging,
tongue lolling out...

454
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:14,173
Oh, he always
gets that way

455
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:16,275
when he fights with Niles.

456
00:16:19,044 --> 00:16:21,013
Good morning, Roz.
Oh, hi.

457
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:22,548
(chuckling)

458
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:23,549
You ready for our debut?

459
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:26,051
Listen, I'm thinking
of calling the show

460
00:16:26,051 --> 00:16:27,920
"Frasier Crane's Aisle Say"

461
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,123
but with the "I'll"
spelled like a theater "aisle."

462
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:33,025
That should work real well
on radio.

463
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:34,526
You better watch
out for Kenny.

464
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:36,028
I hear he's
pretty mad at you

465
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:37,029
for going over his head.

466
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:38,530
Oh, he can't be mad at me.

467
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:40,032
The whole thing
was Poppy's idea.

468
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:42,368
Oh. Here she is now,
come to wish me luck.

469
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:44,236
(chuckling)

470
00:16:44,236 --> 00:16:46,705
Poppy.
I was afraid I wouldn't
get here on time.

471
00:16:46,705 --> 00:16:47,706
Oh, here, here.

472
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:49,708
We've got a few minutes
before the show starts.

473
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:50,642
Take a seat.

474
00:16:50,642 --> 00:16:52,644
Catch your breath.

475
00:16:52,644 --> 00:16:53,545
Oh, gosh,

476
00:16:53,545 --> 00:16:54,913
I'm really glad you made it.

477
00:16:54,913 --> 00:16:56,682
It wouldn't be
a proper debut without you.

478
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,484
Wow. All these buttons.

479
00:16:58,484 --> 00:16:59,485
How do you do it?

480
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:01,487
Oh, it's not that
complicated, really.

481
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:02,988
You know, I turn on
the mike here,

482
00:17:02,988 --> 00:17:03,989
these are my call buttons

483
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:06,492
and, uh... oh,
I push this button here

484
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:07,459
if I want to cough.

485
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:10,396
How does it make you cough?

486
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:14,800
You know, Poppy,
I hate to rush you,

487
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,803
but we've just got
a couple of minutes
before the show, so...

488
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:19,805
Whoo! I'd better
get a move on.

489
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:22,775
(laughing)

490
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:25,077
Poppy, what are you doing?

491
00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:26,678
Getting ready for my show.

492
00:17:26,678 --> 00:17:29,114
One minute.

493
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:31,116
Your show?

494
00:17:31,116 --> 00:17:32,618
Well, okay,our show.

495
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:36,088
After all, it was your idea
for me to do it.

496
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:37,890
Everyone!

497
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,059
Everyone, come
in here, please.

498
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:42,861
Before I begin my new show,

499
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:45,230
I just want to
say a few words.

500
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:49,334
Yesterday,
I was ready to leave KACL

501
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:52,905
to run away, as I
have from so many
other challenges.

502
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:55,207
It was the support of one man--

503
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:57,076
Frasier Crane--

504
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,445
that helped me
overcome the shyness

505
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:01,947
many of you
may have observed in me

506
00:18:01,947 --> 00:18:05,951
and to follow my dreams.

507
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:09,321
Oh, God... I want to cry.

508
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:12,491
We all do.

509
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:13,792
ROZ:
Ten seconds!

510
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:15,661
(Poppy yells)

511
00:18:17,362 --> 00:18:19,231
How could you
do this to us?

512
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:21,300
I had no idea she
intended to stay.

513
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,702
That's not
what her mother told me.

514
00:18:23,702 --> 00:18:26,905
And I thought I'd seen
some cruel pranks in the army.

515
00:18:29,074 --> 00:18:30,909
I assure you, she is
way out of her depth here.

516
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:32,945
Any moment she'll realize
she's in over head,

517
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:35,247
and she'll be begging me
to take over for her.

518
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:37,549
"A Streetcar Named Desire

519
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:40,385
"is a very powerful
Broadway play.

520
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:43,622
"It was made into a movie
starring Marlon Brando.

521
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,023
"This gave the play

522
00:18:45,023 --> 00:18:47,025
"a very personal
relevance for me

523
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:48,994
"as I once sat
next to Mr. Brando

524
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:51,997
"on the Concorde,
and we had a very lovely chat

525
00:18:51,997 --> 00:18:55,267
until a sudden cramp
forced him to change seats."

526
00:18:57,402 --> 00:18:59,738
"Streetcar...

527
00:18:59,738 --> 00:19:03,242

tale of Blanche DuBois

528
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:06,745
(with Southern accent):

529
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:10,516
"very proper
Southern lady...

530
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:13,218
(deep voice):
or is she?"

531
00:19:30,636 --> 00:19:33,639
Go ahead, Niles.
I know you were listening.

532
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:35,641
Well...

533
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:38,610
I wish you'd lent
her your Tennessee
Williams biography.

534
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:40,579
She wouldn't have kept
forgetting his name

535
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:42,915
and calling him Indiana Jones.

536
00:19:47,052 --> 00:19:51,456
If it's any consolation,
I got fired from The Monocle.

537
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:54,826
Oh, Niles, I'm sorry.

538
00:19:54,826 --> 00:19:56,094
Mm.

539
00:19:56,094 --> 00:19:57,896
I panned a wretched musical

540
00:19:57,896 --> 00:20:02,401
not realizing the lead was
the person who does Olga's hair.

541
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:05,204
She fired you
just to placate her hairdresser?

542
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,905
Electrolysist.

543
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:08,774
And if you'd ever

544
00:20:08,774 --> 00:20:11,710
seen her in a sun dress,
you'd forgive her as I have.

545
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,680
Oh, I am sorry, Niles.

546
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,215
Gosh, it's such
a shame, really.

547
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,217
You know, I know how much
you loved that job

548
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,586
and to lose it in such
an unceremonious fashion.

549
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:23,488
Well, you know...

550
00:20:23,488 --> 00:20:25,958
I was thinking
of quitting that job anyway.

551
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,893
Oh?
Mm-hmm.

552
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:30,295
I felt I was
spreading myself too thin.

553
00:20:30,295 --> 00:20:32,564
Getting distracted
from my real work.

554
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:33,865
I had the exact same thought.

555
00:20:33,865 --> 00:20:35,867
Even as I was preparing my show,
I thought,

556
00:20:35,867 --> 00:20:37,636
"Am I being fair
to my regular listeners?"

557
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:38,737
They do depend on you.

558
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,572
As do your patients.
Thank you.

559
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:41,573
Gosh, you know,
is it any wonder

560
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:43,976
we find ourselves
ex-critics?

561
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:46,311
We were meant
to lose those jobs.

562
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:47,779
It's as if
the Gods of psychiatry,

563
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:48,780
jealous of our dalliance,

564
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,149
have quietly stepped in
and put things right.

565
00:20:51,149 --> 00:20:52,484
Well put.

566
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:53,919
Oh, thank you, thank you.

567
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,954
You know, Niles,
if you're feeling a bit hungry,

568
00:20:55,954 --> 00:20:57,322
we could catch an early dinner
and then...

569
00:20:57,322 --> 00:21:00,125
Oh, oh, and then catch
the new Stoppard play.
Splendid!

570
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:01,560
You know,
it's just a shame

571
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:04,563
my listeners never got to hear
my review of Streetcar.

572
00:21:04,563 --> 00:21:06,465
Oh, insightful,
was it?
Groundbreaking.

573
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:07,699
Mm, as was mine.

574
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:09,034
Yes, well, it takes
a psychiatrist

575
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:09,968
to interpret that play.

576
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:12,704
Mm-hmm. Indeed.
All right,
you go first.

577
00:21:12,704 --> 00:21:14,106
All right.
Go.

578
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,607
"A descent into madness
proves well worth the trip

579
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:18,110
in this incandescent revival
of A Streetcar Named Desire."

580
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,111
Just a moment, Niles.
Incandescent--

581
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,612
isn't that the same tired word

582
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:22,114
