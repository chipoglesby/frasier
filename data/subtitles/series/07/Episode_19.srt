1
00:00:08,074 --> 00:00:09,576
Hey, Frasier.

2
00:00:09,576 --> 00:00:10,577
Hello, Poppy.

3
00:00:10,577 --> 00:00:12,078
You should have your
hearing checked.

4
00:00:12,078 --> 00:00:13,079
I've been yelling,
"Wait up,"

5
00:00:13,079 --> 00:00:14,381
for the last
four blocks.

6
00:00:14,381 --> 00:00:15,648
Well, I must be getting old.

7
00:00:15,648 --> 00:00:17,650
Like an old man
could walk that fast.

8
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:19,152
You were practically running
the last block.

9
00:00:19,152 --> 00:00:21,154
Did I ever tell you about
my uncle who ran everywhere?

10
00:00:21,154 --> 00:00:22,088
He ran to the store...

11
00:00:22,088 --> 00:00:24,024
Well, that's
a very a amusing story.

12
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:24,824
I'll see you
at the station.

13
00:00:24,824 --> 00:00:26,559
Roz!

14
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:28,962
Good God. Thank
God you were here.

15
00:00:28,962 --> 00:00:30,463
I know exactly how
you feel.

16
00:00:30,463 --> 00:00:31,898
Last week, I ducked
into a bathroom stall

17
00:00:31,898 --> 00:00:32,966
to get away from her,
and there were

18
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:34,801
three other women
already in there.

19
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:37,637
Gosh.

20
00:00:37,637 --> 00:00:38,538
Listen, I have
a favor to ask.

21
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:39,372
This friend of mine
is running

22
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:40,940
this charity dinner/dance
Friday night...

23
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:42,208
Oh, Roz,
say no more.

24
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:43,476
What do they need,
an autographed picture

25
00:00:43,476 --> 00:00:44,344
for their silent auction?

26
00:00:44,344 --> 00:00:46,646
That would be a silent auction.

27
00:00:46,646 --> 00:00:47,981
Oh, very funny.

28
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:49,449
No, what I was hoping you would
do is buy some tickets.

29
00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:51,384
They're only 100 bucks each.

30
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:52,352
I don't know, Roz.

31
00:00:52,352 --> 00:00:53,319
You know,
I'd have to take a date.

32
00:00:53,319 --> 00:00:54,821
Seattle does have
certain expectations

33
00:00:54,821 --> 00:00:56,790
about the sort of person
I should be seen with.

34
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,591
Well, that's easy.
Here he is.
Oh.

35
00:00:58,591 --> 00:01:00,326
Let's see if he's free.
I'll let you know.

36
00:01:00,326 --> 00:01:02,729
Hey, Roz. Frasier.

37
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:03,730
Niles.
Mind if I join you?

38
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,231
Well, actually,
I'm not staying.

39
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:06,299
I'm avoiding
someone.

40
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:08,301
Oh? Who?

41
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:09,736
The new so-called
arts critic

42
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:12,072
at the station--
Poppy.
Oh. Uh-huh.

43
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:13,273
The woman
drives me mad.

44
00:01:13,273 --> 00:01:14,841
She's gassing
on endlessly

45
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:16,176
about the most
mundane matters.

46
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:18,011
It's absolutely
infuriating,

47
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:20,380
as is that
smirk of yours.

48
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:21,681
Well, I'm sorry.

49
00:01:21,681 --> 00:01:23,249
I've noticed
that not a day goes by

50
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:25,085
that you don't bad-mouth
this woman.

51
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,921
Well, with good reason.
The woman is a wind sock.

52
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:28,755
Mm-hmm.

53
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:29,589
I'm wondering
if someone

54
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:31,591
isn't protesting
a bit too much.

55
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:34,594
She's very attractive,
obviously well-bred.

56
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:37,063
Perhaps all this pigtails-
in-the-inkwell hostility

57
00:01:37,063 --> 00:01:39,065
is actually a latent attraction.

58
00:01:39,065 --> 00:01:40,533
Oh, well, bravo,
Dr. Crane.

59
00:01:40,533 --> 00:01:42,402
Yes, I think
you're really onto
something there.

60
00:01:42,402 --> 00:01:44,070
POPPY:
Hey, where'd Roz go?

61
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,338
Oh, she dashed
off to the office.

62
00:01:45,338 --> 00:01:46,906
We're going to
continue our
meeting there.

63
00:01:46,906 --> 00:01:48,241
You know, Poppy,
I was just telling
my brother

64
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:51,111
what an enchanting
storyteller you are.

65
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,113
Why don't you
take my seat,

66
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:55,615
and he can find
out for himself.

67
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:57,617
Ta-ta.

68
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:59,119
Well, it's, uh,

69
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,121
nice to finally
meet you, Poppy.

70
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:04,991
Must be quite a story
behind that name.

71
00:02:04,991 --> 00:02:06,793
Yes.

72
00:02:08,661 --> 00:02:11,164
So...

73
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:12,665
you're the new arts critic
at the station.

74
00:02:12,665 --> 00:02:15,101
That... that must be
interesting.

75
00:02:15,101 --> 00:02:17,337
Oh, yes.

76
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:20,240
Okay, well, um...

77
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,241
if you don't feel
like talking,

78
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:22,742
I should really
be running anyway.

79
00:02:22,742 --> 00:02:23,676
No, don't go.

80
00:02:23,676 --> 00:02:25,612
I am just amazed

81
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:27,447
at how different you are
from your brother.

82
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:29,249
He's sort of
intimidating.

83
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:30,750
I get so flustered
around him,

84
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,285
I just start
babbling.

85
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:35,555
But you...
you're different.

86
00:02:35,555 --> 00:02:37,790
You're very warm.

87
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:39,259
Thank you.

88
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:41,261
So are you.

89
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:42,762
And polite.

90
00:02:42,762 --> 00:02:45,698
Not to mention
stylish and charming

91
00:02:45,698 --> 00:02:49,002
and incredibly handsome.

92
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:53,506
Oh, my God, am
I babbling again?

93
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:54,941
If you were,
I'd be too charming

94
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:56,409
and polite to tell you.

95
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:05,652
Well, what the
hell are you doing?

96
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:10,423
I've been waiting

97
00:03:10,423 --> 00:03:12,292
for 20 minutes.

98
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:15,762
I am so sorry.

99
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:18,031
You're probably
wondering

100
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,732
who I am.

101
00:03:19,732 --> 00:03:22,669
I'm mildly curious.

102
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:25,638
I was in the shower--
my shower...

103
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:27,640
Uh, I just moved in next door.

104
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,642
I probably should have started
with that, huh?

105
00:03:29,642 --> 00:03:31,644
Anyway... oh, I'm
Regan Shaw, by the way.

106
00:03:31,644 --> 00:03:33,413
Nice to see you.
Anyway, uh...

107
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:35,615
the doorbell rang, and I figured
it was the phone guy,

108
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:37,183
'cause I've been waiting
all day long.

109
00:03:37,183 --> 00:03:40,186
So I ran to catch him,
stepped out into the hallway

110
00:03:40,186 --> 00:03:41,955
and locked myself out.

111
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:46,259
Luckily,luckily,
your father came along.

112
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,062
Hey, Fras.

113
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:51,231
Yes, that was lucky.

114
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,066
All right, well, this
should keep you nice and warm,

115
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,567
and I'll just run
in the kitchen

116
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:57,303
and get you
your herbal tea.

117
00:03:57,303 --> 00:03:59,138
If you'll excuse me,

118
00:03:59,138 --> 00:04:01,107
I'll just show my father

119
00:04:01,107 --> 00:04:03,009
where it's kept.

120
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,845
Pretty sweet, huh?

121
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:06,846
I just found her
right out in the hall.

122
00:04:06,846 --> 00:04:09,282
Yes, well, I'm sorry, Dad,
but you can't keep her.

123
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:13,620
No. I brought her here for you.

124
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,089
I've been talking you up
the whole time.
Really?

125
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,490
Yeah. Listen.

126
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,792
I'm serving this one
to you on a platter.

127
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:22,562
In fact, if it wasn't
for the jasmine on your robe,

128
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:24,364
I'd say that this one
was a slam dunk.

129
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:25,565
I just wonder...
It's a basketball term.

130
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:27,567
Yes, I know that, Dad.

131
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:30,003
I just wonder how to chat up
a half-naked woman

132
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:31,804
without looking uncouth.

133
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:33,640
Well, just
be friendly.

134
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,476
She's a veterinarian,
she's single, uh...

135
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:39,312
She's very athletic,
as you can tell from that body.

136
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:40,680
Lord in heaven!

137
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,015
Oh, Dad, please...

138
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:43,516
Just because you're
serving the cake

139
00:04:43,516 --> 00:04:44,984
doesn't mean you can't
have a few crumbs

140
00:04:44,984 --> 00:04:47,387
that drop off.
(groans)

141
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:48,788
(chuckling):
Hi.

142
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:51,791
Well, here we go.

143
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:52,625
There you are.

144
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,494
Now, uh, I got
a call to make,

145
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:56,996
so Frasier will keep you
entertained.

146
00:04:56,996 --> 00:04:57,997
Thanks for the tea.

147
00:04:57,997 --> 00:04:59,432
You're welcome.

148
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:02,802
So, uh... you're next door.

149
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,570
Oh, that's right.

150
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:07,740
Judge Gilroy moved
in with his daughter.

151
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,443
I bet he never wandered into
your apartment wearing a towel.

152
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:11,811
No, no. I did
hear he wandered

153
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:14,314
into work one day
wearing a towel, though.

154
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,816
I guess that's why
he had to move in
with his daughter.

155
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:19,686
That was dumb.
I walked off with your car keys.

156
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:22,889
I should have known
from the big "BMW" on it.

157
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:31,197
Thank you, Dad.

158
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:33,032
So...

159
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:35,401
"Regan." That's an unusual name.

160
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:36,869
Is it, by any chance, from...

161
00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:37,837
From King Lear,yeah.
A-ha.

162
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,672
One of the ungrateful
daughters.

163
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:41,841
I don't know what
my dad was thinking.

164
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,643
Never do.

165
00:05:43,643 --> 00:05:45,144
I'm sorry.

166
00:05:45,144 --> 00:05:47,447
I have some issues
with my father.

167
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:49,248
Excuse me again.

168
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:53,586
I have no idea what
that would be like.

169
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,691
Well, I'd better be
on my way, huh,

170
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:00,360
and, uh,

171
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,994
just let you
two talk.

172
00:06:01,994 --> 00:06:04,364
Oh, he's a wonderful
listener, you know?

173
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,865
In fact, that's the motto

174
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:08,801
on his very popular
radio show: "I listen."

175
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:10,670
Yes, Dad,
don't forget

176
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,805
my sign-off:
"Good-bye."

177
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,812
I actually listen to your show.

178
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:22,281
Really? Well, I'm
flattered. Thank you.

179
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:24,217
I think if I hadn't gone
into veterinary medicine,

180
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,485
it would have been psychology.

181
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:29,255
I guess I was always
just drawn to animals.

182
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:34,727
Yes, it is hard
not to love them.

183
00:06:48,674 --> 00:06:51,744
MARTIN:
I just feel so responsible.

184
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:54,247
Maybe there was
something more I
could have said,

185
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,582
something more I
could have done.

186
00:06:56,582 --> 00:07:00,853
I keep playing it
over and over in my head.

187
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:05,258
I'll ask her out today, Dad.

188
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,693
So, Dr. Crane,
do you believe women have

189
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:09,195
an intuition about men?

190
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:10,696
Uh, intuition?

191
00:07:10,696 --> 00:07:12,698
Well, like
they might know

192
00:07:12,698 --> 00:07:14,200
when a man has
a little crush,

193
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,202
you know, by the way
he fidgets

194
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:19,539
or gets a look
in his eye or...
Well...

195
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:22,608
(alarm ringing)

196
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:23,943
(alarm stops)

197
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,948
I only ask because
I'm getting that feeling

198
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,883
from your brother.
Really? Hmm.

199
00:07:30,883 --> 00:07:32,785
He's all moony-eyed today.

200
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:34,287
There's someone
he's quite keen on.

201
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,289
Yes. Actually, I know who it is.

202
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,291
I called him on it yesterday
in the coffee shop.

203
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,258
He won't admit to it.

204
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:41,060
The problem is...

205
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,862
Yeah?

206
00:07:43,362 --> 00:07:45,364
I've developed
a crush myself,

207
00:07:45,364 --> 00:07:46,833
and it happens to be...

208
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:49,836
Frasier?

209
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:57,176
What ya doing?

210
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,214
Nothing. Come in. Come in.

211
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:03,716
So, Niles,
how are you?

212
00:08:03,716 --> 00:08:06,552
Uh, well, the question is,

213
00:08:06,552 --> 00:08:09,622
how are you?

214
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:10,957
I hear you've been
mooning around

215
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:12,391
like a lovesick schoolboy.

216
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:13,759
Who told you that?

217
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:14,594
Oh, let's just say

218
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:15,595
the birds around
here are chirping.

219
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:19,165
Anyway... are you
prepared to admit

220
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:22,101
that my little theory
yesterday was correct?

221
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:24,604
Are you talking
about Poppy?
Yes.

222
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:28,040
The woman you so adamantly
denied having any attraction to.

223
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,009
I still do. She's loathsome.

224
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,880
Does it gall you so much
to admit I'm right?

225
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,047
But you're not right.

226
00:08:35,047 --> 00:08:37,350
Oh. Well, then,
who is this person

227
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,618
you're so interested in?

228
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:40,419
You don't know her.
Uh-huh.

229
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:41,921
Tell me about her.
It's premature.

230
00:08:41,921 --> 00:08:43,422
Oh, brother.

231
00:08:43,422 --> 00:08:44,423
All right, fine.

232
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:46,325
If you must know,
the woman happens to be...

233
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:47,193
(knocking on door)
Hello?

234
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,462
Her-- my next-door neighbor.

235
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:52,064
Oh, what good timing she has.

236
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,334
Hi. Come on in.

237
00:08:55,334 --> 00:08:57,336
I just wanted
to return this teacup.

238
00:08:57,336 --> 00:08:58,871
Oh, well, you're
welcome anytime.

239
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:00,840
Uh... Regan Shaw,

240
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,242
this is my brother,
Dr. Niles Crane.

241
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:06,612
Hello.
Hello.

242
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:07,947
Do you two know
each other?

243
00:09:07,947 --> 00:09:09,815
Yes.
No.

244
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:12,618
Well...

245
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:14,053
I'll just go
get us all some coffee,

246
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:19,458
and you two can decide
if you know each other or not.

247
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:21,327
I'm so sorry,

248
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:22,295
Dr. Crane.

249
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:23,796
I was just
a little startled

250
00:09:23,796 --> 00:09:25,298
seeing you
outside your office.

251
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:26,799
Uh, please, don't
even think about it.

252
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:27,633
Have a seat.

253
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:30,002
Uh... well,
so I gather

254
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:31,003
this is your
new building.

255
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:33,005
Yes. Right next door
to your brother,

256
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:34,507
who I just met.

257
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:36,509
Is that so strange?

258
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:37,343
Yes. Well,
remember,

259
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:40,012
I have a policy
of total confidentiality.

260
00:09:40,012 --> 00:09:42,381
He never needs to
know that you've
started seeing me.

261
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:48,888
Oh. Here it is.

262
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:51,724
What did you
find out?

263
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:54,226
Well, it sounded like
they've had a date or two.

264
00:09:54,226 --> 00:09:55,528
He mentioned
having seen her.

265
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:58,798
Damn him.

266
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:00,266
Come to think of it,

267
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,267
he said something
in the elevator

268
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,035
about having a crush on someone.

269
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:04,337
I'll just have to confront him,
see if he's man enough

270
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:06,639
to admit that he's horned in
on my territory.

271
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:07,940
Well, excuse me,
Dr. Crane,

272
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,942
but didn't your brother
meet her first?

273
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:11,944
Oh, honestly, Daphne,
just try to keep up.

274
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:13,913
It's not that complicated.

275
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:16,382
Well, here we are.

276
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:17,817
Actually, I can't stay.

277
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:19,185
I've got
the cable man coming.

278
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:21,187
Oh.
Could I take
a rain check?

279
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:22,188
Well, certainly.

280
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:24,190
Uh... would you like

281
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:26,192
to go out for
coffee sometime?

282
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:27,693
Yeah, I'd like that.

283
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:28,694
Great.

284
00:10:28,694 --> 00:10:30,196
Bye.
Bye.

285
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:31,197
Bye.

286
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:39,438
So, I take it
you two do know each other.

287
00:10:39,438 --> 00:10:41,641
Uh, we met briefly
at some event.

288
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,542
I see.

289
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:45,544
Changing the
subject completely,

290
00:10:45,544 --> 00:10:47,546
Daphne just mentioned
that you happen to have

291
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:49,048
a little crush on
someone yourself.

292
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:51,384
(sighs):
Yes, I have.

293
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:53,252
Care to elaborate?

294
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:54,253
Actually, I will.

295
00:10:54,253 --> 00:10:56,522
Unlike you, I don't mind
being candid.

296
00:10:56,522 --> 00:10:59,659
The woman... is Poppy.

297
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,560
Poppy?

298
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:07,066
Uh, we had coffee yesterday
after you left.

299
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:09,368
Uh... you're not upset?

300
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:10,236
No, not at all.

301
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:12,738
Thank you
for your candor, Niles.

302
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:15,741
I'm sure that you and Poppy
will be very happy together.

303
00:11:15,741 --> 00:11:16,709
(stifles laughter)

304
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:19,178
Are you laughing at me?

305
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:21,180
You think so little
of my chances?

306
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,415
FRASIER:
No, no, Niles.

307
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:24,750
I wish you and Poppy
the very best.

308
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:28,220
I don't need
this smug attitude of yours.

309
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,722
I fully intended
to discuss this amiably.

310
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:32,058
You refused,
so I'll just say good-bye.

311
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:34,326
Very well, thanks
for dropping by. Off you go.

312
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:35,661
Oh!

313
00:11:35,661 --> 00:11:38,130
What kind of a fool
does he take me for?

314
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:39,632
He is obviously
pursuing Regan.

315
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:42,134
The man has the nerve
to say he's chasing Poppy!

316
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:43,536
Poppy?
Yes, as if anyone

317
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:48,074
could pursue
that insufferable air horn!

318
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:49,341
If it's deceit
and chicanery he's after,

319
00:11:49,341 --> 00:11:50,843
I'll give him more
than he can handle.

320
00:11:50,843 --> 00:11:53,713
Dr. Crane, before it
gets to that level,

321
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:56,115
wouldn't it make sense
for you two to just have

322
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:57,883
one open and honest
conversation?

323
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:59,251
Oh, honestly, Daphne,
how you manage

324
00:11:59,251 --> 00:12:01,687
to oversimplify
absolutely everything!

325
00:12:06,258 --> 00:12:08,227
These shoes
are killing me.

326
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:09,762
I can't wait
to sit down.

327
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:10,730
Well, you're not
going to sit there.

328
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,032
Why not?
I'm expecting
someone for coffee.

329
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:15,167
Well, Niles is small.
We can share.

330
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:16,035
It is not Niles.

331
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:17,536
Would you stop
saying that?

332
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:18,471
It happens to
be a woman.

333
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:20,906
Well, I'll move
when she gets here.

334
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:22,908
By the way, I still have
four tickets left

335
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:24,677
for that charity ball
Friday night.

336
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:25,945
Oh, I'm sorry, Roz;
thanks anyway.

337
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:26,812
Oh, come on.

338
00:12:26,812 --> 00:12:27,680
It's for a good cause.

339
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,548
They provide disaster relief.

340
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:30,750
Howdy, partners!

341
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,118
How soon can they get here?

342
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:35,121
Frasier, I was leaving
the booth,

343
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:36,122
and I saw this umbrella.

344
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:38,591
I think it belongs
to you.

345
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:39,992
FRASIER:
Yes.

346
00:12:39,992 --> 00:12:41,927
It's my emergency umbrella.

347
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:43,829
I always leave it in the booth.

348
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:47,266
Don't feel bad.
I'm forgetful, too.

349
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:51,237
You know, I think
I'll just go...

350
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:52,738
see what's
keeping my latte.

351
00:12:52,738 --> 00:12:56,242
Would you watch my table,
please, Roz?

352
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:05,117
Hello, Roz.

353
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:06,619
I noticed that
Poppy was here.

354
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:07,620
Did she mention where
she was headed?

355
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,455
No. But listen, Niles,

356
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:10,790
could I interest you
in a couple of tickets

357
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,291
for a charity ball this Friday?

358
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,726
It's a great event.

359
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:15,094
Is Frasier going?
No,

360
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:16,996
but do you have to go
to everything together?

361
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:17,963
I'll take two.

362
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:20,466
Uh, I'm in a hurry;
I'll send you a check.

363
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:23,469
Where is Niles in
such a rush off to?

364
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:24,436
I have no idea.

365
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:26,972
Last chance--
only two tickets left.

366
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:28,374
What? I thought
there were four.

367
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:29,608
Niles just bought a pair.

368
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:31,477
Damn him!

369
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,479
He's probably
off to intercept
Regan right now.

370
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,480
Who?

371
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,981
I'm sorry, Roz.
I'm in a hurry.

372
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:38,250
I'll write you
a check for these.

373
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,518
Enjoy the table.

374
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,988
This is the best kind
of party.

375
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:45,491
We get to dress up,
have a wonderful time,

376
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:47,326
and it's all
for a good cause.

377
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,128
Well, it really is
an impressive organization.

378
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:52,631
I've heard that within 24 hours
of any worldwide disaster,

379
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:54,133
they can put together
a ball.

380
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:55,935
(giggles)

381
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:57,970
Oh, look, it's
your brother.

382
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,104
What?

383
00:13:59,104 --> 00:14:00,840
NILES:
Oh. So it is.

384
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,741
Uh, why don't you find
our table,

385
00:14:02,741 --> 00:14:03,742
and I'll get us
some champagne.

386
00:14:03,742 --> 00:14:05,744
Okay.

387
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:09,248
Roz, you didn't tell me

388
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:10,115
Frasier was going
to be here.

389
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:11,951
Yeah, he bought
the last two tickets.

390
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:13,352
After he knew I'd
be here with Poppy.

391
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,321
Obviously, he
wants to get a
shot at her himself.

392
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:17,089
He brought that woman
along as his beard.

393
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:19,191
Do you think Frasier's
interested in Poppy?

394
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:21,026
I shouldn't
be surprised

395
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,528
the subtle signs
of attraction
are lost on you--

396
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,530
a woman to whom
the gunning of
a Harley engine

397
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,866
is like a "come
hither" look.

398
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:31,604
Hello, Roz.
Hi.

399
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:34,373
I see that Niles has brought
himself a date for the evening.

400
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,709
Yep, and you'll never guess
what he thinks.

401
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,177
Oh, I know
exactly what he thinks.

402
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:39,678
He thinks by bringing Poppy
as his patsy,

403
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:41,180
he can steal a few minutes
with Regan,

404
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,481
try to win her for himself.

405
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:43,816
That's not
what he thinks.
Roz!

406
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:48,287
He likes Poppy.
Oh... dear,
simple Roz.

407
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:50,222
After six years
of listening at my feet,

408
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:52,191
have you learned nothing
of the dark forces

409
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:53,225
that move people?

410
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:55,194
Open your ears.

411
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:07,139
Are you looking
at your brother again?

412
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:08,641
Yes. I'm sorry.

413
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:10,643
It's just that he keeps
staring over here,

414
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:11,477
for God's sakes!

415
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:12,811
He hasn't paid
any attention

416
00:15:12,811 --> 00:15:13,646
to his date
whatsoever!

417
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:15,481
Can you imagine how
that woman must feel?

418
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:18,450
Yeah. Women hate that.

419
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,352
He's doing it again.
What?

420
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:21,854
My brother is
staring at us,

421
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:22,888
obviously thinking

422
00:15:22,888 --> 00:15:24,657
what a striking couple
we make.

423
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:27,226
In fact, let's give him
something to stare at.

424
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:31,463
Oh!
Oh, I'm sorry.

425
00:15:31,463 --> 00:15:32,965
Same toe as before?

426
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:33,966
Yes, same toe
as before.

427
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:35,200
(chuckles)

428
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,037
What is going on
with you two tonight?

429
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:40,539
All right.

430
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:41,540
I suppose you're going
to find out

431
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,541
sooner or later anyway.

432
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:46,545
You see... I know
about you and Niles.

433
00:15:46,545 --> 00:15:47,546
You do?

434
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:49,048
Yes, but it's all right.

435
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:50,549
I don't mind.

436
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:53,052
It's just that, well...

437
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:55,054
he's really quite
smitten with you.

438
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:56,055
(gasps)

439
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:58,524
Oh, my God. Really?

440
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:00,926
You think you're going
to lose the nail?

441
00:16:00,926 --> 00:16:02,928
No, no. I just need
to sit for a minute.

442
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:05,965
(tango playing)

443
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,467
Oh, my gosh, I
love the tango!

444
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:09,935
You won't mind
if I dance one

445
00:16:09,935 --> 00:16:11,837
with your brother?
What?

446
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:12,638
Well, actually,
Poppy, I...

447
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,139
Oh, come on.

448
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,641
Niles can keep
Regan company.

449
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,142
Ow!

450
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:21,146
Uh, you know...

451
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:23,649
Regan, I'm getting
a second wind.

452
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,417
Uh, shall we show
them how it's done?

453
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:27,119
Well, actually, Dr. Crane, I...

454
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:28,053
Oh, don't be so formal.

455
00:16:28,053 --> 00:16:30,522
We're not doctor
and patient tonight.

456
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:32,524
Oops.

457
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,333
Your brother's
quite the romantic,

458
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:42,768
inviting me to a ball

459
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:44,336
on our very first date.

460
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:46,839
He certainly doesn't
waste time, does he?

461
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,607
No, he doesn't,
does he?

462
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:57,850
You do realize that I'm
interested in your brother.

463
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,352
You mean you're
developing real
feelings for him?

464
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:01,353
Yeah.

465
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:03,355
Well, you may
think so now,

466
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:06,158
but trust me, your
future's not with him.

467
00:17:06,992 --> 00:17:10,496
I know this
is confusing.

468
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:15,000
You'll see everything
more clearly

469
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,502
when I've got you
on the couch.

470
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:18,437
Oh.

471
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:25,577
Well, I can't take
any more of this.

472
00:17:25,577 --> 00:17:27,012
All right, I
have to cut in.

473
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:29,014
See? How romantic.

474
00:17:29,014 --> 00:17:31,016
Yes, come with me.

475
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:34,520
You should be ashamed
of yourself.

476
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,889
Your tango wasn't so
impressive, either.

477
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,690
I'm talking
about your behavior tonight.

478
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:40,192
You mean that I won't
simply stand aside

479
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:41,560
and let you have
the woman you want?

480
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,929
Exactly. Obviously,
one of us has to back off--

481
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:45,831
not just tonight,
but permanently.

482
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:48,267
Frasier, can I talk
to you a minute alone?

483
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:49,134
Of course.

484
00:17:49,134 --> 00:17:50,969
Just give me one more moment
with my brother.

485
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:52,404
Niles, when you're
finished,

486
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:53,405
I'd love
one more dance.

487
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:56,408
Ah. I'll be right there.

488
00:17:57,376 --> 00:18:00,679
Well, I believe
she has made her choice.

489
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:03,849
Yes, I believe she has.

490
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:12,958
Uh...

491
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:14,326
Frasier, I think
I'd like to leave,

492
00:18:14,326 --> 00:18:15,327
if that's all right.

493
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:16,728
Leave? Already?

494
00:18:16,728 --> 00:18:20,032
Well, couldn't we just
have one last dance?

495
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:20,933
Well, I guess.

496
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:22,935
I'm just feeling
a little uncomfortable.

497
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:24,403
Yes, I certainly don't
blame you for that,

498
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:25,871
but you see,
now that I've spoken with him,

499
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:27,372
Niles has agreed
to behave himself.

500
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:29,875
Now I can... put all
my attention on you.

501
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:31,376
Oh...

502
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:33,378
That is a relief.

503
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:34,880
I mean, you
can understand

504
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,716
how I was a kind of
freaked out by all that.

505
00:18:37,716 --> 00:18:39,685
Right?

506
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:43,088
Frasier.

507
00:18:43,088 --> 00:18:45,991
FRASIER:
He's a brave
little soldier, isn't he?

508
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:49,895
Awash in despair,
and yet he dances.

509
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:51,363
This is when
they wrote songs

510
00:18:51,363 --> 00:18:53,866
that were really
about something--

511
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:57,369
true love...
broken hearts...

512
00:18:57,369 --> 00:18:59,872
Yes, there's nothing
quite so poignant

513
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:01,373
as someone with
a broken heart

514
00:19:01,373 --> 00:19:04,710
pretending
that it isn't.

515
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:07,045
No wonder he keeps
staring over at us.

516
00:19:07,045 --> 00:19:11,049
He's suffered such
a crushing defeat tonight.

517
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:12,551
Can we go?

518
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:14,853
Well... yes, of
course, that's...

519
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:16,655
that's the best
thing to do.

520
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:19,057
No... let me just have
one last word with him.

521
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:21,493
Oh, my God.

522
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:23,428
Niles, if you don't mind.

523
00:19:23,428 --> 00:19:25,864
You guys are going
to wear me out.

524
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:28,233
Could I see you
at the bar, please?

525
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:31,103
I think I'm going
to catch a cab.

526
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:32,604
Aren't you having
a good time?

527
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:34,039
Frankly, no. Are you?

528
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:38,310
Well, yes. I think Niles has got
quite a little crush on me.

529
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:40,646
But, actually, Poppy,
there's something

530
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:43,582
you should know
about Niles.

531
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:46,018
Niles, I just want
you to know that I...

532
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,519
I'm not happy
with the way

533
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,021
things have ended
this evening.

534
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:52,024
Well, neither am I.
How could I be?

535
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:54,526
And the worst thing is,
it's not just tonight.

536
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:57,029
What happens when we keep
running into each other?

537
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:57,963
Yes.

538
00:19:57,963 --> 00:19:59,932
The victor will have his trophy.

539
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:01,800
The loser will be empty-handed.

540
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,169
Hardly seems worth it,
given the permanent damage

541
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:05,170
this could do
to our relationship.

542
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:06,171
Yes, I can't
help but wonder

543
00:20:06,171 --> 00:20:08,674
if perhaps we're being
a bit shortsighted.

544
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:11,677
Niles, is that Regan

545
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:13,145
and Poppy leaving
just now?

546
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:16,648
It was, wasn't it?

547
00:20:20,285 --> 00:20:22,588
I want you to go after her.

548
00:20:22,588 --> 00:20:23,855
What?

549
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:27,793
Yes. I won't stand
in your way.

550
00:20:27,793 --> 00:20:30,729
No. Frasier,
I would feel better

551
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:32,130
if you went after her.

552
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:34,299
No. No, I couldn't
do that to you.

553
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:35,601
(sighs)

554
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:38,370
I think we're both feeling
the same thing.

555
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:43,141
I know we are...
you noble bastard.

556
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:46,011
Right back at you.

557
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:49,248
Oh, it's for the best.

558
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:52,517
After all, the most important
thing is our friendship.

559
00:20:52,517 --> 00:20:54,686
I think that's worth
drinking to.

560
00:20:54,686 --> 00:20:56,021
Two bourbons.

561
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:57,489
You know, while
we're at it,

562
00:20:57,489 --> 00:20:58,957
let's propose a toast

563
00:20:58,957 --> 00:21:01,960
to one pretty
remarkable woman.

564
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,462
Well, she'd have to be

565
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:04,963
to have won
both of our hearts.

566
00:21:04,963 --> 00:21:05,931
Hear, hear.

567
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:06,865
Well, then...

568
00:21:06,865 --> 00:21:08,867
To Poppy.
To Regan.

569
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:19,344
I think we're going
to need two more here.
