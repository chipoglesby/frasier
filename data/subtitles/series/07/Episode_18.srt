1
00:00:07,574 --> 00:00:09,509
ROZ:
I'm sorry
I brought Alice today,

2
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:11,077
when we have
so much work to do.

3
00:00:11,077 --> 00:00:12,512
FRASIER:
Oh, that's all right, Roz.

4
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:14,581
You know what? You'll find
another nanny soon.

5
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:15,582
I'd better.
Yeah.

6
00:00:15,582 --> 00:00:16,583
I have a date tomorrow.

7
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:17,917
It's my first one
in a month.

8
00:00:17,917 --> 00:00:20,020
A month.

9
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,287
Between spending

10
00:00:21,287 --> 00:00:23,289
my days with you
and my nights with Alice,

11
00:00:23,289 --> 00:00:25,792
I've forgotten what
a real conversation is like.

12
00:00:25,792 --> 00:00:26,593
Well...

13
00:00:26,593 --> 00:00:27,927
don't tell Alice that.

14
00:00:27,927 --> 00:00:29,429
It might hurt her feelings.

15
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:31,798
(baby crying)

16
00:00:31,798 --> 00:00:33,166
Whoop, there we go again.

17
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,069
Okay.
Thanks.
Mm-hmm!

18
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:37,070
Hello.

19
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:38,071
Hello.
Hello, boys.

20
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:39,572
Just look at
the dapper gent

21
00:00:39,572 --> 00:00:40,573
I ran into
on the elevator.

22
00:00:40,573 --> 00:00:41,975
All right, Niles,
that's enough.

23
00:00:41,975 --> 00:00:43,877
Yes, I like the
suit you got me.

24
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:46,379
All right, well,
tell me about the comments.

25
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:47,881
Did everybody there
ooh and ahh?

26
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:50,383
No. People were
pretty much looking

27
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:52,152
at the guy in the casket.

28
00:00:53,753 --> 00:00:55,121
So, Dad,
how was the funeral?

29
00:00:55,622 --> 00:00:56,623
Oh, it was terrible.

30
00:00:56,623 --> 00:00:58,625
It's not at all the way
Stan would've wanted it.

31
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:00,527
They did everything
on the cheap.

32
00:01:00,527 --> 00:01:01,928
And that daughter of his--

33
00:01:01,928 --> 00:01:03,430
she didn't even get
the good priest.

34
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:04,931
She got some rookie
from the seminary

35
00:01:04,931 --> 00:01:06,433
who stumbled
all through the eulogy

36
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:09,769
and couldn't even pronounce
"Wojadubakowski."

37
00:01:09,769 --> 00:01:12,072
Well, I can commiserate
with you, Dad.

38
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:14,574
I had rather a bad day
on the death front, myself.

39
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:15,542
Uh, sherry?

40
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:16,810
Yes, please, Niles.

41
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:18,111
I received
a letter today

42
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:21,114
informing me that,
thanks to my divorce,

43
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:25,085
I've lost my plot at
Seattle's toniest cemetery.

44
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:28,021
You mean
you're out of Verdant Hills?

45
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:29,522
Oh, I am sorry, Niles.

46
00:01:29,522 --> 00:01:32,459
I know how much you were looking
forward to being dead there.

47
00:01:33,893 --> 00:01:35,395
They've wait-listed me,

48
00:01:35,395 --> 00:01:36,896
but I don't
like my odds.

49
00:01:36,896 --> 00:01:37,797
Mm.

50
00:01:37,797 --> 00:01:39,532
FRASIER:
I don't blame you.

51
00:01:39,532 --> 00:01:40,834
One country club fire,

52
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:42,602
you can kiss
your chances good-bye.

53
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:44,838
I went to all sorts of funerals
as a child.

54
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:46,339
My uncle's a mortician.

55
00:01:46,873 --> 00:01:47,740
Lovely man.

56
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:50,543
He's offered to do my makeup
for the wedding.

57
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:55,115
I can just hear
the whispers now.

58
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,484
"Did you see the bride?
Very lifelike."

59
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:00,787
Dad, you know, I'm sorry

60
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:03,156
about your friend's funeral
not going so well.

61
00:02:03,156 --> 00:02:04,591
Rest assured,
when the time comes--

62
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:05,492
years from now--

63
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:08,328
Niles and I will follow
your wishes to the letter.

64
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:09,195
Thank you.

65
00:02:09,195 --> 00:02:11,498
By the way, Dad,
what are your wishes?

66
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:13,266
Never mind. I'm not gonna
go planning

67
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:14,601
my own funeral.
It's bad luck.

68
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:15,835
But, Dad...
Nuh-uh-uh.

69
00:02:15,835 --> 00:02:17,170
You don't pull
the cord on the bus

70
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:18,705
until you're ready to get off.

71
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:24,444
Pull the what
on the what?
I don't...

72
00:02:27,113 --> 00:02:29,582
I'm surprised--
I didn't know Dad
had such a bugaboo

73
00:02:29,582 --> 00:02:30,583
about his funeral
arrangements.

74
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:32,485
Yeah, I know,
it's a painful subject,

75
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:33,887
but we've got to plan for it.

76
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:35,388
We all must be prepared

77
00:02:35,388 --> 00:02:37,891
when the cold hand of death
comes knocking on our door.

78
00:02:38,391 --> 00:02:40,727
(hard knocking)

79
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:45,798
Would you get that?

80
00:02:45,798 --> 00:02:47,734
I most certainly will not.

81
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,476
Pizza.
Oh, thank you
very much.

82
00:02:58,311 --> 00:02:59,612
Bulldog.

83
00:02:59,612 --> 00:03:00,380
Good Lord.

84
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,848
Oh, come in, come in.

85
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:02,849
Oh, heavens.

86
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,317
Oh, you remember
my brother, Niles.

87
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:05,318
Niles,
you remember Bulldog.

88
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:06,719
Yes, of course.
Hello, Bulldog.

89
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:08,988
So, you're delivering pizzas
for a living?

90
00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:10,823
Uh, no,
I'm an eccentric millionaire.

91
00:03:10,823 --> 00:03:12,325
This has always been my dream.

92
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,095
Bulldog, I can't tell
you how sorry I am...
Hey, no, no, no, no.

93
00:03:16,095 --> 00:03:17,497
Can the sad face, okay?

94
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:19,799
I'm just making some extra cash
between radio gigs.

95
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:21,467
Well...
Oh, it's 18 bucks,
by the way.

96
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:23,002
Oh, right.
You know,
I-I just stopped by

97
00:03:23,002 --> 00:03:24,504
to leave off
these opera tickets.

98
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:26,005
I'll be on my way.
Oh, thank
you, Niles.

99
00:03:26,005 --> 00:03:27,373
By the way,
I'm a little
short of cash.

100
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:29,008
Do you mind, uh...?

101
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:31,511
Oh, yes.
Thank you.

102
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:33,313
(whispers):
Let's see...
(muttering)

103
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:35,815
There you are.
And, uh...

104
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:37,650
a little something
extra for you.

105
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:40,019
Wow. That's a pretty
generous tip.

106
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:42,522
Oh, I'll say--
wrong bill.

107
00:03:48,828 --> 00:03:50,597
Hey, good luck, Doc.
I'll see ya.

108
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:51,598
Thanks, Bulldog.
Take care.

109
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:52,599
All right.

110
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:54,567
Bulldog.

111
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:56,302
Oh, Roz.

112
00:03:56,302 --> 00:03:59,105
Are you delivering pizzas?

113
00:03:59,105 --> 00:04:01,107
Yeah, yeah.

114
00:04:01,107 --> 00:04:03,109
This is kind
of awkward, huh?

115
00:04:03,109 --> 00:04:05,612
Oh, no, don't
be embarrassed.

116
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:06,913
A job's a job.

117
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,114
No, I mean awkward for you.

118
00:04:08,114 --> 00:04:10,416
This is the first time
you've seen me since, uh,

119
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:11,651
we had that fling
and I dumped you.

120
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:13,920
I dumped you,pizza boy.

121
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,188
Yeah, whatever.

122
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:18,625
Hey, look
who's here.

123
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:21,628
Hey, sweet pea,
you are getting so big.

124
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:23,730
Hey, look at that smile;
she likes me.

125
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,131
She's relieved not to be

126
00:04:25,131 --> 00:04:27,066
the least-mature person
in the room anymore.

127
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:29,535
Who's got a mean old mommy?

128
00:04:29,535 --> 00:04:30,970
(softly):
Roz?

129
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:33,840
Listen, I think
you may have solved

130
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,408
your baby-sitting
problem.

131
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:36,409
Bulldog? Are you nuts?

132
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:37,910
Yes, well, look.

133
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:39,412
Alice is obviously
crazy about him.

134
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:41,247
He could use the money.

135
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:42,849
(coos)

136
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:43,583
I don't know.

137
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,151
Oh, okay, fine.

138
00:04:45,151 --> 00:04:47,153
Fine, Roz, you just
cancel your date.

139
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:49,155
I mean, you've been
this long without a man.

140
00:04:49,155 --> 00:04:50,657
What's a few days more?

141
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:52,091
Bulldog, do you want a job?

142
00:04:58,264 --> 00:05:01,334
BULLDOG:
Okay, come on, one more bite...

143
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:03,836
and we can watch
Sports center.

144
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:07,206
Have you seen my purse?

145
00:05:07,206 --> 00:05:08,508
Yeah, it's on the chair.

146
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:10,443
Oh.

147
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:12,445
Steve is going to
be here any minute.

148
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:14,447
So, you been dating
for a while?

149
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:15,348
Actually, no.

150
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:16,716
Tonight's our first date.

151
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:19,018
In fact, it's my first date
in a month.

152
00:05:19,018 --> 00:05:20,687
Whoa, you injured?
You pull something?

153
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:22,021
No.

154
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:24,490
I guess, uh, no one
quite measured up

155
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,359
to that week you spent
in the doghouse, huh?

156
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:27,727
Let's get one thing straight.

157
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:29,262
That little fling we had
is way over.

158
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:30,763
I know, I know,
I know, I know.

159
00:05:30,763 --> 00:05:32,765
I was joking.
Okay.

160
00:05:32,765 --> 00:05:35,234
Well, okay, if
you're not going
to have some peaches

161
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:37,270
we got some Jell-O
in the fridge, huh?

162
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,771
You know, some
naughty ladies

163
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:40,573
like to wrestle
in that stuff.

164
00:05:40,573 --> 00:05:42,141
(knock at door)

165
00:05:42,141 --> 00:05:44,610
Oh, who's that?
Who's that?

166
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,045
Let's go see...

167
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:48,047
let's go see who it is.

168
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:51,050
Hey.
Oh!

169
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:52,919
Excuse me. Is this
Roz Doyle's apartment?

170
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:54,454
Yeah, yeah. You her date?

171
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:55,955
Yeah.
Listen up.

172
00:05:55,955 --> 00:05:57,490
You go out with Roz tonight,

173
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,492
I will rip off your arm,
ram it down your throat,

174
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:01,961
and use it to squeeze your heart
until it stops beating.

175
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:03,963
Hey, who's my pretty girl?

176
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:06,966
Huh? Hmm?

177
00:06:06,966 --> 00:06:08,368
Okay, dirt ball,

178
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:09,769
as soon as you get out of here

179
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:11,771
you call Roz, and you cancel
like a gentleman.

180
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:13,272
And, as far as she's concerned,

181
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:14,774
this conversation
never took place. Got it?

182
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,043
Uh... who are you?

183
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:19,278
I'm your worst nightmare:
The baby-sitter.

184
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:24,751
Okay, time to brush
your toothies.

185
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:25,752
Whoa!

186
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:26,753
Do I look slutty?

187
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:28,521
All right, if you're

188
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:31,057
fishing for compliments,
yeah, you look slutty.

189
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,258
(phone ringing)

190
00:06:34,827 --> 00:06:36,329
Hello?

191
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:38,564
Hey, Stephen.

192
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:40,166
Oh, really.

193
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:43,603
Well, tomorrow's Saturday.
I mean, you won't have to...

194
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:45,071
(sighs)

195
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:47,573
No, it's okay.

196
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:48,875
Yeah, bye.

197
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:51,677
I don't believe it.

198
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:53,679
My first date in a month,

199
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:55,181
and he blows me off.

200
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:57,183
At the last minute?

201
00:06:57,183 --> 00:06:58,518
What a jerk.

202
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:00,186
He does not deserve you.

203
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:02,121
Thanks, Bulldog.

204
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:03,456
Yeah...

205
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:05,324
Well, I guess I can go.

206
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:08,161
Oh!

207
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:09,662
I ordered a pizza.

208
00:07:09,662 --> 00:07:12,165
Uh, just, uh, have him
drop it by my place.

209
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:13,166
Oh.

210
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:14,500
Oh, I'm at the YMCA.

211
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,868
Oh, have him, uh...

212
00:07:15,868 --> 00:07:17,437
well, have him knock hard.

213
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,206
I turn up the radio
to drown out the sirens.

214
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:23,476
Why don't you just stay
and have your pizza?

215
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:24,777
Well, are you sure?

216
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:27,146
Yeah, it's not like
I'm doing anything tonight.

217
00:07:27,146 --> 00:07:28,614
Okay.
Come and tell us

218
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:30,116
what you guys did
at the park today.

219
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,617
Ah!

220
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,619
We fed the ducks.

221
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:35,621
We went on a pony ride

222
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:38,524
and came back for
a whole jar of peas.

223
00:07:38,524 --> 00:07:41,194
Peas? How'd you get her
to eat those?

224
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:42,962
Oh, there's a trick to it--
you got to pretend

225
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,330
to sneeze them
out of your nose.

226
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:47,099
How'd you come up with that?

227
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:48,501
It's an
interesting story.

228
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:50,503
Actually, don't tell me.

229
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:54,941
(murmuring voices)

230
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:56,008
NILES:
Frasier.

231
00:07:56,008 --> 00:07:57,510
FRASIER:
Oh. Good afternoon, Niles.

232
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:58,478
NILES:
Coffee's on me.

233
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:59,946
I'm back in
Verdant Hills Cemetery.

234
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:02,281
Oh, well, congratulations.

235
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:04,050
Nothing left now
but all that pesky waiting.

236
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:04,984
(both chuckling)

237
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,919
I haven't gotten
the official word yet,

238
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:08,187
but, uh, I've
called in a favor.

239
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:09,989
Bruce Mcguirk is
on the board of directors.

240
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:12,492
I gave him grief counseling
when his uncle was lost at sea.

241
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:15,461
And it occurred to me--
there's a plot gone begging.

242
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:19,932
Tell me something.
Do I have the word

243
00:08:19,932 --> 00:08:21,701
"loser" tattooed
across my forehead?

244
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:22,568
No, Roz.

245
00:08:22,568 --> 00:08:24,036
But there is a rumor

246
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:26,372
about a Tweety Bird
on your upper thigh.

247
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,408
(chuckles)

248
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:30,910
I had two dates this
week, and both of them

249
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:32,845
have bailed out on me
at the last second.

250
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:34,647
What's wrong with me?
Oh, don't count

251
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:35,915
yourself out just yet, Roz.

252
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:37,283
Yeah, right.
No, no. There's

253
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:39,185
a young man over there
who can't take his eyes off you.

254
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:41,020
He's been staring at you
ever since you came in.

255
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,591
(gasps) That's Ted
from the ad department.

256
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:47,527
We've been making eye contact
for months.

257
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:48,995
Oh, yes, Ted.

258
00:08:48,995 --> 00:08:51,998
Well, his gaze is so steamy,
it's re-foaming my latte.

259
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:53,499
(both laugh)

260
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:55,434
Why don't you go over there
and talk with him?

261
00:08:55,434 --> 00:08:57,436
I can't.
I don't know what to say.

262
00:08:57,436 --> 00:08:58,905
I'll tell you what,
ask him to dinner.

263
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:00,373
I'm going to Chez Henri myself
this evening.

264
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:01,707
I'll call and get you a table.

265
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:02,542
Oh, I don't know;
I'm feeling

266
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,410
a little gun-shy.
Roz, you'd
better hurry.

267
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:06,279
If he sees you talking to me
another minute longer,

268
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:08,281
he'll think he's got
some serious competition.

269
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:09,248
(laughs)

270
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:11,183
Thank you, Frasier.
I needed a good laugh

271
00:09:11,183 --> 00:09:12,685
to loosen me up.
Go.

272
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:15,254
Yes, hello, Henri.

273
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:16,255
It's Frasier Crane.

274
00:09:16,822 --> 00:09:17,823
(phone rings)

275
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,325
Yes, I was just wondering--

276
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:20,326
I'd like to get a table

277
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:22,328
for a dear friend
of mine tonight, as well.

278
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:23,329
Niles Crane here.

279
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:24,830
Hello, Bruce. I hope
you're calling

280
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,332
with good news
about Verdant Hills.

281
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:27,333
Table for two.

282
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,335
Yes, a plot for one.

283
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:31,337
By the kitchen?

284
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:32,338
Oh, Lord, I was hoping

285
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:33,839
for something
near the fireplace.

286
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:34,840
Near the parking lot?

287
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:36,842
I'd prefer the
Serenity Garden.

288
00:09:36,842 --> 00:09:38,344
Oh, the back room
would be fine.

289
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:39,845
Uh, who's at the next table?

290
00:09:39,845 --> 00:09:41,814
The hilltop is divine.

291
00:09:41,814 --> 00:09:42,848
Who's in the
adjacent plot?

292
00:09:42,848 --> 00:09:44,350
The Ashby's? Wonderful.

293
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:46,252
The Ashby's? Delightful.

294
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,553
Thank you very much.

295
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:48,955
I'm so grateful.
Ahh...

296
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:52,258
Mcguirk got me a shady
spot on the high hill.

297
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,359
You mean...?
Yes.

298
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:55,561
I'll spend eternity
looking down on Maris.

299
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:56,295
Oh, Niles.

300
00:09:56,295 --> 00:09:57,563
Checkmate!

301
00:09:57,563 --> 00:09:58,731
(laughing)

302
00:09:58,731 --> 00:10:00,066
He said yes.

303
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:02,068
Well, of course, he did,
Roz. Congratulations.

304
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:03,569
And you're all set
at Chez Henri.

305
00:10:03,569 --> 00:10:04,870
Great.
BULLDOG:
Okay!

306
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:08,174
What sorry bastard would steal
a pacifier from a kid?

307
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:10,676
This stinks!
This is total b.s.!

308
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:12,478
This... Oh...
found it, found it.

309
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:16,182
Listen, Bulldog,
I hate to do
this to you.

310
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:17,216
Hey, Alice.

311
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:18,718
Can you baby-sit
tonight?

312
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:19,685
I just got a date

313
00:10:19,685 --> 00:10:21,120
with Ted over there.

314
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,121
Really?
Yeah.

315
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:23,623
Yeah, sure, I can stay.

316
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,358
Hey, way to go, slugger.
Thanks. I'd better

317
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:27,526
go home and get ready.
Hey, you go
ahead. I'll, uh...

318
00:10:27,526 --> 00:10:29,362
I'll catch up with you
after I hit the can.

319
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:30,830
Oh. Lovely.

320
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:36,268
Hey, Ted. Right?

321
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:38,037
Bulldog.
Long time no see.
Yeah.

322
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:39,872
Hey, I hear you're going out
with Roz tonight.

323
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:41,841
Yeah.
Listen up.

324
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:43,609
You have her home
45 minutes

325
00:10:43,609 --> 00:10:45,444
after you pick her up,
or you'll be sorry.

326
00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:46,779
(chuckles):
Yeah?
Hmm.

327
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:48,981
What are you going
to do about it?

328
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:51,651
(snapping)

329
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,386
Oh, my God!

330
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:54,654
If I'm willing
to do that to me,

331
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:55,621
just think
what I'll do to you.

332
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:57,890
Okay, 45 minutes.

333
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:59,225
Or else.

334
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,165
Hey, boys, feel
like taking a ride?

335
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:08,000
Uh...
Well, sure, Dad.

336
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,168
Where to?
Well, I got
thinking

337
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:11,103
about what we were talking
the other night,

338
00:11:11,103 --> 00:11:12,605
you know, about me
not having made

339
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:15,107
any arrangements for myself,
and so I just went out,

340
00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:16,475
and I bought myself
a burial plot.

341
00:11:16,475 --> 00:11:18,411
(chuckling)

342
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:18,911
Wow.
All right.

343
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,413
Let's go have
a look, Dad.
Yeah.

344
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:21,914
You know, I'm glad to see

345
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:23,416
you finally realized
there's no point

346
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,418
in being superstitious
about the whole thing.

347
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:28,354
No, I realized,
if I let you
plan my funeral,

348
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:29,855
that it'd be all
harps, white wine,

349
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:31,857
and, frankly,
a lot of very
pissed-off cops.

350
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:35,861
Right up here on the left.

351
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:37,930
Got the whole service
mapped out.

352
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:40,933
It'll start with a bagpipe
a-marching down the aisle.

353
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:41,934
Bagpipes?

354
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:43,436
I'm having bagpipes
at my wedding.

355
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:44,437
You knew that.

356
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:46,906
And none of that dainty
finger food either--

357
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:47,940
big slabs of beef, prime rib.

358
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,408
You can't have
prime rib.

359
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:50,910
I'm having prime rib.

360
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,445
Oh, for Pete's sake.
No, no, this is lovely.

361
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:54,447
If you kick off
before I get married,

362
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:55,448
you'll ruin
everything.

363
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:56,449
All right,
I'll drop the bagpipes.

364
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:57,950
No, no, have
the bagpipes.

365
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:58,951
What else are
you gonna have?

366
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:00,953
A big cake with
a little white
coffin on the top?

367
00:12:00,953 --> 00:12:02,955
Oh, just put a sock
in it, will ya?

368
00:12:02,955 --> 00:12:04,457
Wouldn't surprise me
if you had a hearse

369
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:06,959
with "Just buried"
on the side of it.
Don't start!

370
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,961
I'm warning you!

371
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,202
Pretty great, huh?

372
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:17,703
Mm-hmm.
Mmm!
Yeah.

373
00:12:17,703 --> 00:12:19,205
And I'll put
your mom's ashes

374
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:20,506
over there on the left,

375
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:22,708
because that was her side
of the bed and, um...

376
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:25,111
Oh! See how close we are
to the maintenance shed?

377
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:26,011
Mmm.

378
00:12:26,011 --> 00:12:27,413
And that's good
because...

379
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:29,749
You're the first one
to get mowed.

380
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,052
Yeah.

381
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:35,054
So, do you really
like this place?

382
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:36,889
Yes, Dad.

383
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:38,724
Oh... uh, Fras, take about
three steps

384
00:12:38,724 --> 00:12:40,025
over to your left, will you?

385
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:43,329
Keep going,
keep going.

386
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:44,330
Oh.

387
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:45,831
There you are.

388
00:12:45,831 --> 00:12:47,833
Niles, stand
right next to him.

389
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:49,735
Uh-huh.
Yeah.

390
00:12:49,735 --> 00:12:53,072
Congratulations, you're standing
on your very own graves.

391
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:54,607
What?!

392
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,375
(laughs):
Yes!

393
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,677
Well, they were for sale,
so I went ahead and bought them.

394
00:12:58,677 --> 00:13:00,679
And, after seeing how much
you like it out here,

395
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:01,680
I'm glad I did.

396
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:03,182
Oh...
Oh, but, Dad...

397
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:04,583
Aw, I know what
you're going to say--

398
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,986
the expense,
but don't worry about it.

399
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:08,854
Merry Christmas.

400
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:20,699
(door opening)

401
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:22,134
(sighs heavily)

402
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:24,136
Sorry we had to rush
out like that.

403
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:26,071
Me, too. Is your stomach
feeling any better?

404
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:29,408
Um... not really.

405
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:32,111
Can I get you
some ginger ale or...

406
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:32,845
(cracking)

407
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:34,180
I really better go now.

408
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,681
Wait.

409
00:13:44,056 --> 00:13:45,391
She's asleep, Roz.

410
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:46,892
Don't worry,
I won't disturb you and...

411
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:48,194
Where's Ted?

412
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:50,329
He ditched me.

413
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,564
What?!

414
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:53,499
He kept saying his stomach
was bothering him,

415
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:54,934
but he was looking
at his watch

416
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:56,001
the whole time.

417
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,504
What is wrong with men?

418
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:02,575
It's not him. It's me. This
has been happening all week.

419
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:03,442
No, no, no, no.

420
00:14:03,442 --> 00:14:04,810
Trust me. It is not you.

421
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:06,212
Those guys are jerks.

422
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:08,447
Thanks, Bulldog.

423
00:14:09,815 --> 00:14:12,785
Hey, oh, look, if
you're hungry, I...

424
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:14,787
I was just whipping up
a little something.

425
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:16,722
There's probably enough for two.

426
00:14:16,722 --> 00:14:18,624
Great.

427
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:20,626
I'm just going to
go change, okay?

428
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:22,628
Okay.

429
00:14:35,674 --> 00:14:37,610
(knock at door)

430
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:40,946
What the hell
are you doing here?

431
00:14:40,946 --> 00:14:42,181
I know. I'm sorry.

432
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:43,549
You are supposed to be gone.

433
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,551
How many of my own fingers
do I have to dislocate

434
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:46,886
before you take me
seriously?

435
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,487
TED:
I got her home in
45 minutes, okay?

436
00:14:48,487 --> 00:14:50,789
She left this
in the car...
(barks)

437
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:58,063
(sighs)

438
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:00,900
This smells delicious.

439
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,401
Ah, ah, ah, ah!

440
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,404
Thank you.

441
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,407
Ow.

442
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:10,409
I guess I'm a little tense
from that date.

443
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,878
Well, allow me.

444
00:15:12,878 --> 00:15:14,813
Ow, ow, ow!

445
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:18,884
You're tight.

446
00:15:20,152 --> 00:15:21,954
Oh.

447
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:24,456
I forgot how good
you were at this.

448
00:15:25,457 --> 00:15:27,459
Come to think of it...

449
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:30,262
you were good
at a lot of things.

450
00:15:32,564 --> 00:15:34,333
Whoa.

451
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:37,102
Victoria's Secret,
page 39.

452
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:42,007
Why don't we just skip dinner
and go straight for dessert?

453
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:42,908
Oh, whoa.

454
00:15:42,908 --> 00:15:45,911
Penthouse Forum,
page 23.

455
00:15:45,911 --> 00:15:47,913
(Roz laughing)

456
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:49,915
Are you the new pizza man?

457
00:15:49,915 --> 00:15:52,384
I hope you're not double-parked.

458
00:15:52,384 --> 00:15:53,886
I promise you, ma'am,

459
00:15:53,886 --> 00:15:55,888
I will deliver
in 30 minutes...

460
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:57,856
or more.

461
00:15:57,856 --> 00:16:00,292
Wait. There's a scented candle
out on the balcony.

462
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:02,061
Would you get that for me?

463
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:03,862
I'm kind of naked here.

464
00:16:03,862 --> 00:16:05,831
It's cedarwood.

465
00:16:05,831 --> 00:16:08,267
It promotes stamina
and sexual creativity.

466
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:09,335
I'll be right back.

467
00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:13,372
Roz, open the door.

468
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:15,274
Oh, I get it.

469
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:17,176
Pizza man!

470
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:19,845
You slimebag!

471
00:16:19,845 --> 00:16:22,147
You've been scaring
off my dates all week!

472
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:23,382
I don't know what
you're talking about.
Cut the crap!

473
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:25,184
I just saw you
talking to Ted!

474
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:27,286
This is the lowest
thing you've ever done.

475
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:28,554
After the way I've
trusted you, this is

476
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:30,322
the way you treat me?
Look, will you let
me in, please?

477
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:32,124
No!
Come on, it's freezing

478
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:34,626
out here, as you
can plainly see.

479
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:37,596
Good. I want
you to suffer.

480
00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:39,031
(sighs)

481
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:40,599
Oh, don't sit there.

482
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:43,002
I eat off that table,
for God's sake.

483
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,370
Roz?
Get dressed!

484
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:45,371
Roz, come on.

485
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:46,372
No!
Roz, wait!

486
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:47,873
Wait. Will you
let me explain?

487
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:49,375
I don't want to hear it.

488
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:50,876
You make me sick.
Just get out!

489
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:53,379
Roz, I wasn't just trying
to get you in bed.

490
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:55,247
Just give me
a second, please?

491
00:16:57,616 --> 00:16:59,118
All right, last spring

492
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:01,487
when we were together,
it was great.

493
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:03,722
And...

494
00:17:03,722 --> 00:17:07,593
I didn't know how to handle it,
so I ran away...

495
00:17:07,593 --> 00:17:10,429
But, when I saw you again,
it was...

496
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:13,966
I figured if I could keep
the competition

497
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:16,969
out of the way, then maybe...

498
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:18,470
you and I, I don't know...

499
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,239
we could be a couple.

500
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:22,307
Us?

501
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:25,511
I think I'm in love with you.

502
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:36,021
You're not saying anything, Roz.

503
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:48,267
Wait a minute.

504
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:50,202
I know what you're doing.

505
00:17:50,202 --> 00:17:52,071
What?

506
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:55,441
All this love stuff is just
another way to get me into bed.

507
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:57,209
No, Roz, no.

508
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:58,944
God, it's the oldest
trick in the book.

509
00:17:58,944 --> 00:17:59,978
Wait a minute, Roz...

510
00:17:59,978 --> 00:18:01,980
And you're still at it;
you're still at it.

511
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:05,217
No, listen, listen, Roz.
Give up, Bulldog.
Give up, Bulldog.

512
00:18:08,353 --> 00:18:10,222
You can't blame a guy
for trying, huh?

513
00:18:10,222 --> 00:18:11,223
No!

514
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:12,558
I had you going, huh?
Yes!

515
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:16,328
With all the dishes
and the laundry... ah!

516
00:18:16,328 --> 00:18:17,563
You're the master.

517
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:20,132
Yeah. Oh, I even put child-proof
latches on the, uh,

518
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:21,433
on the cabinets-- you know,

519
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:22,668
part of my plan
to get you in the sack.

520
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:24,570
You are such a pig!

521
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:30,509
Well...

522
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:32,277
I better be going.

523
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:33,545
Okay.

524
00:18:36,014 --> 00:18:38,517
Thank you for all
of your help with Alice.

525
00:18:38,517 --> 00:18:40,018
Oh...

526
00:18:40,018 --> 00:18:42,688
I'll see you, Bob.

527
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:47,059
See you, Roz.

528
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,429
(sighs heavily)

529
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:01,206
(knock at door)

530
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:03,175
I'm sorry, Mrs. Wozniak.

531
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:06,678
I know the balcony
is not for sex play.

532
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:11,316
FRASIER:
It's Frasier.

533
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:13,652
And by the way,
charming.

534
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,923
It's open.

535
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:19,892
Well, I just saw you dash
out of the restaurant with Ted.

536
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:21,727
I thought,
"My God, what's wrong?"

537
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:25,030
You are not going to believe
what just happened.

538
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:27,366
Bulldog just told me
he loved me.

539
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:28,233
What?

540
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:29,201
Yeah, he made Ted

541
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:30,702
bring me home early.

542
00:19:30,702 --> 00:19:32,971
It turns out he's been
scaring my dates off all week.

543
00:19:32,971 --> 00:19:34,706
Well, what did you say to him?

544
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:38,977
I tried
to let him down easy.

545
00:19:38,977 --> 00:19:40,812
I felt sorry for the guy.

546
00:19:40,812 --> 00:19:42,781
Bulldog. Wow.

547
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:44,216
He's full
of surprises, isn't he?

548
00:19:44,216 --> 00:19:46,185
Who'd have thought?

549
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:49,221
(both chuckle)

550
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:51,490
You know what's
really weird?

551
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:52,991
I'm going to miss him.

552
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:54,893
Look at this.

553
00:19:54,893 --> 00:19:56,328
I never had to worry
about Alice.

554
00:19:56,328 --> 00:19:58,330
He kept this place so neat.

555
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:01,833
And it was really nice
to have someone to...

556
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:04,136
someone to come home to.

557
00:20:05,404 --> 00:20:08,440
Well, maybe Bulldog--
in his own clumsy way--

558
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,209
gave you a taste of a

559
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,411
more traditional
lifestyle.

560
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:13,812
Yes, I suppose so.
Mmm.

561
00:20:13,812 --> 00:20:15,581
Who knows, Roz?

562
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:16,348
Maybe the time has come.

563
00:20:16,848 --> 00:20:18,717
You might be willing
to start looking for a...

564
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,452
What? A husband?

565
00:20:20,452 --> 00:20:22,588
No, I wasn't going
to say that. I...
Just because I'm gonna

566
00:20:22,588 --> 00:20:23,388
miss certain things
about Bulldog

567
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:25,290
doesn't mean I need
to rush out and get married.

568
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:27,593
Fine.
I mean, look at
this week I've had.

569
00:20:27,593 --> 00:20:29,461
Three guys interested in me,

570
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:30,829
not to mention Bulldog.

571
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:33,999
I mean,
I'm liking this.

572
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:37,069
Single life's pretty good.

573
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:39,771
All right, Roz.

574
00:20:39,771 --> 00:20:42,708
As long as you're okay.

575
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:44,710
I really appreciate
you coming by.

576
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:45,711
It's okay.

577
00:20:46,211 --> 00:20:47,479
I'll see you tomorrow.

578
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:48,747
Of course.

579
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:50,082
Good night.

580
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,450
