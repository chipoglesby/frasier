1
00:00:09,224 --> 00:00:11,943
Nowfor a difficult one.

2
00:00:15,689 --> 00:00:19,523
Firm, velvety rind, bit smoky.

3
00:00:20,402 --> 00:00:22,393
Applewood, I think.

4
00:00:22,654 --> 00:00:25,851
This is what I get for sending you
to camp in France.

5
00:00:26,158 --> 00:00:28,956
Can I help you with anything else?

6
00:00:29,244 --> 00:00:32,361
No, thanks.
This $6 can of dog food will be fine.

7
00:00:33,665 --> 00:00:37,544
It'll sure teach me not to leave my
shopping until the last minute again.

8
00:00:37,878 --> 00:00:40,995
- Is it Reblochon?
- You are good, Dr Crane.

9
00:00:41,298 --> 00:00:43,289
Yeah, he's a regular cheese whiz.

10
00:00:44,718 --> 00:00:46,788
I'll take half a pound of the Reblochon

11
00:00:47,054 --> 00:00:51,206
and half a pound of Saint Andre and
I know I ask this every week, but...

12
00:00:51,558 --> 00:00:53,788
-...is it here?
- Is what here?

13
00:00:54,061 --> 00:00:56,621
You know
I mean the imported Swiss prosciutto.

14
00:00:56,897 --> 00:01:00,173
The Bündnerfleisch. I am sorry.

15
00:01:00,484 --> 00:01:03,237
If only you had been here one hour ago.

16
00:01:03,528 --> 00:01:07,077
- Damn.
- You would have seen it arrive.

17
00:01:09,326 --> 00:01:11,635
- I have my fun with you.
- You do, Robert.

18
00:01:11,912 --> 00:01:14,585
I long for the days
when you barely spoke English.

19
00:01:14,873 --> 00:01:17,262
Slice like the wind.
I'll take a pound.

20
00:01:17,542 --> 00:01:21,660
18 dollars a pound? This
salami's good, but it's not that good.

21
00:01:22,005 --> 00:01:23,996
Itwas aged for six months

22
00:01:24,257 --> 00:01:27,533
and air-cured in a small village
at the foot ofthe Pyrenees.

23
00:01:27,844 --> 00:01:30,404
- A steal at that price.
- You got that right, pal.

24
00:01:30,681 --> 00:01:33,241
Dad, ifyou want to wait outside...

25
00:01:33,517 --> 00:01:37,396
I'm fine. Look at all these
different kinds of olive oil.

26
00:01:37,729 --> 00:01:40,038
Virgin, extra virgin...

27
00:01:41,483 --> 00:01:45,192
Extra virgin?
How does that work?

28
00:01:46,905 --> 00:01:49,863
I guess ifyou can cure a sausage...

29
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:55,255
Monsieur, I am so glad
you find my food so amusing.

30
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:58,014
Robert, he's only joking.
Keep on slicing.

31
00:01:58,291 --> 00:02:02,079
Come on now. Even you've got to admit
this whole store is kind of nutty.

32
00:02:02,421 --> 00:02:05,140
$14 for a pound of goat cheese?

33
00:02:05,424 --> 00:02:08,416
For that price,
I ought to be able to get a whole goat.

34
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:10,949
And we're slicing.

35
00:02:11,221 --> 00:02:15,134
Perhaps you would be more
comfortable ifyou justwaited outside.

36
00:02:15,475 --> 00:02:17,386
You want me to leave,
come out and say it.

37
00:02:17,644 --> 00:02:20,761
- Fine. Leave from my store.
- No problem. Come on, Niles.

38
00:02:21,064 --> 00:02:25,376
- He wants us to "leave from his store".
- Don't hurry back.

39
00:02:25,736 --> 00:02:29,695
All the money in the world
wouldn't get me back in this snob shop.

40
00:02:32,075 --> 00:02:35,784
He is my father. So I can't leave here
with a bag ofyour merchandise.

41
00:02:36,121 --> 00:02:38,112
- Home delivery?
- Thank you.

42
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:42,567
No one treats my father that way.
Those olives, too. No one.

43
00:02:49,301 --> 00:02:51,940
About the photo shoot?
Will you need make-up?

44
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,335
Heavens no.

45
00:02:53,555 --> 00:02:57,309
I think that you look
very handsome without it.

46
00:02:57,643 --> 00:03:02,114
Really? I think you look
very attractive with make-up.

47
00:03:02,481 --> 00:03:07,714
Not that you need it. But ifyou are
wearing make-up, it's so well applied

48
00:03:08,111 --> 00:03:10,705
that I wouldn't even know
you're wearing make-up.

49
00:03:10,989 --> 00:03:13,298
Bet it looks like I'm wearing rouge.

50
00:03:13,575 --> 00:03:15,805
I know what you meant.
And thank you.

51
00:03:16,078 --> 00:03:18,956
Dr Crane,
I've been meaning to ask you,

52
00:03:19,247 --> 00:03:22,478
what do you think about two people
who work together dating?

53
00:03:22,793 --> 00:03:25,591
Well, Sharon,
I'm asked that question a lot,

54
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:30,634
and the stark reality is that
that situation is fraught with...

55
00:03:32,886 --> 00:03:35,275
...delightful possibilities.

56
00:03:35,555 --> 00:03:40,390
- So, are you free on Friday?
- Yes, Friday it is. After the show.

57
00:03:40,769 --> 00:03:43,567
- Great.
- Great.

58
00:03:47,359 --> 00:03:48,758
- Dr Crane?
- Yes.

59
00:03:48,986 --> 00:03:52,183
Clint Webber. I'm hosting
the new show on health issues.

60
00:03:52,489 --> 00:03:54,923
Of course. Dr Webber.
Welcome to KACL.

61
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,078
I'm in your debt
for recommending my audition tape.

62
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:00,361
Not at all. It was very good.

63
00:04:00,622 --> 00:04:03,898
We'd gotten tired ofthe
last show that was in that time slot,

64
00:04:04,209 --> 00:04:06,643
Bert, the Backyard Gardener.

65
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:12,472
Rumour that his latest crop gave
new meaning to the term "potting shed".

66
00:04:12,884 --> 00:04:15,682
Perfect timing. Come, Clint.

67
00:04:17,222 --> 00:04:21,977
Roz Doyle, my producer. This is Dr Clint
Webber, the new host of Health Watch.

68
00:04:22,352 --> 00:04:24,229
- Hi.
- Hi. Great to meet you.

69
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,028
- So, you're new.
- That's right.

70
00:04:28,358 --> 00:04:30,747
- And a doctor?
- That's right.

71
00:04:37,993 --> 00:04:40,587
I don't want to be late
for that station tour.

72
00:04:40,871 --> 00:04:43,339
Again, welcome aboard, Clint.

73
00:04:43,623 --> 00:04:46,262
Could I have acted any goofier?

74
00:04:46,543 --> 00:04:48,773
Not without a set of fake buck teeth.

75
00:04:49,046 --> 00:04:53,119
He's so handsome. I can't work with
someone that handsome. No offence.

76
00:04:53,467 --> 00:04:56,425
Granted,
when it comes to the looks department,

77
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,190
- Dr Webber and I aren't in the same...
- Species?

78
00:05:02,309 --> 00:05:05,824
I was going to say league,
but species is so much more insulting.

79
00:05:07,773 --> 00:05:11,561
This stinks. The chicks are going nuts
over this Webber guy.

80
00:05:11,902 --> 00:05:15,133
I'm the only sex symbol around here.
Look at this.

81
00:05:15,447 --> 00:05:21,238
Come on. Come on, take your best shot.
No, whoa, not you. One of those guys.

82
00:05:21,662 --> 00:05:24,620
Bulldog, you're behaving immaturely,
even for you.

83
00:05:24,915 --> 00:05:26,951
There's no reason to feel threatened.

84
00:05:27,209 --> 00:05:30,645
I must confess, I didn't
notice he was all that handsome.

85
00:05:33,173 --> 00:05:36,324
You didn't notice? You of all people?

86
00:05:38,095 --> 00:05:40,734
Just what are you insinuating?

87
00:05:41,014 --> 00:05:44,086
Well, you know, that you're a little...

88
00:05:44,393 --> 00:05:47,624
For your information, I happen
to be a happily married man.

89
00:05:50,941 --> 00:05:52,932
You're married?

90
00:05:54,528 --> 00:05:56,564
To a woman?

91
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,590
Of course to a woman.
You've all heard me mention Deb.

92
00:06:00,909 --> 00:06:04,265
How often have I said, "l must
run along. Deb will be waiting"?

93
00:06:04,579 --> 00:06:07,935
- We thought Deb was your cat.
- She is not a cat.

94
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:11,686
She is Mrs Gilbert Leslie Chesterton,
a Sarah Lawrence graduate

95
00:06:12,004 --> 00:06:15,633
and the owner of a very successful
auto body repair shop.

96
00:06:17,551 --> 00:06:21,305
Honestly, the conclusions people make
just because a man dresses well

97
00:06:21,638 --> 00:06:24,277
and knows how to use a pastry bag.

98
00:06:26,601 --> 00:06:30,355
Well, that's the first time
I've ever seen a man "in" himself.

99
00:06:35,694 --> 00:06:39,528
Dad, I can't help noticing
Eddie's looking a bit glum.

100
00:06:39,865 --> 00:06:41,856
Yeah, he's mad at me.

101
00:06:42,117 --> 00:06:46,349
I gave him a can ofthat dog food from
your fancy gourmet place the other day.

102
00:06:46,705 --> 00:06:48,696
- He didn't like it?
- He loved it.

103
00:06:48,957 --> 00:06:50,709
Now he won't eat anything else.

104
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:54,269
Even turned his nose up
at a kosher pickle and he loves those.

105
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:59,351
I called all over Seattle and Frenchy's
the only one who carries that stuff.

106
00:06:59,718 --> 00:07:03,916
- Would you consider apologising?
- I'm never going in that store again.

107
00:07:04,264 --> 00:07:07,256
There is a technique of sleep feeding

108
00:07:07,559 --> 00:07:10,835
involving an eye dropper
and a high fructose protein shake.

109
00:07:11,146 --> 00:07:14,616
- I don't know about that.
- It worked on Maris.

110
00:07:15,817 --> 00:07:17,887
Hello, Niles, Dad.

111
00:07:18,153 --> 00:07:21,145
Hello, Roz. How are you doing?

112
00:07:22,074 --> 00:07:24,634
- Frasier, are you aware...
- Yes, I'm aware.

113
00:07:25,786 --> 00:07:27,902
We were taking publicity photos today.

114
00:07:28,163 --> 00:07:30,438
I had an allergic reaction
to the make-up.

115
00:07:30,707 --> 00:07:34,382
I wasn't planning on wearing any
but there's a handsome new employee.

116
00:07:34,711 --> 00:07:38,624
Everybody's feeling insecure.
They were all slapping their make-up on,

117
00:07:38,966 --> 00:07:43,084
so l, too, gave in to vanity. And like
lcarus, flying too close to the sun,

118
00:07:43,428 --> 00:07:46,465
- l, too, paid the price.
- Wow!

119
00:07:46,765 --> 00:07:50,041
I don't go to the mythology well often,
but that was spot on.

120
00:07:50,352 --> 00:07:52,343
No, I mean that guy. He's so handsome.

121
00:07:52,604 --> 00:07:55,516
- It's him. It's Dr Webber.
- Roz, that's enough.

122
00:07:55,816 --> 00:07:58,535
- He is striking.
- Frasier's jealous.

123
00:07:58,819 --> 00:08:01,379
I am not jealous.
Yes, the man is handsome.

124
00:08:01,655 --> 00:08:05,204
But I'm sure there's a number of areas
in which I am his superior.

125
00:08:05,534 --> 00:08:09,766
Good looks can be a mixed blessing.
People roll out the red carpet for you,

126
00:08:10,122 --> 00:08:13,910
but that robs you of any incentive
to develop other qualities.

127
00:08:14,251 --> 00:08:18,164
After a while you are left an ageing
Narcissus, bent at the water's edge,

128
00:08:18,505 --> 00:08:23,056
realising those lines
in the pond aren't ripples.

129
00:08:23,427 --> 00:08:26,464
- They're wrinkles.
- Amazing.

130
00:08:26,763 --> 00:08:31,154
- I rather liked that one myself.
- That guy could be a movie star.

131
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:34,302
Roz, don't we have some work to do?

132
00:08:34,563 --> 00:08:38,397
- Take this table. I have a session.
- Yeah, I've got to go, too.

133
00:08:38,734 --> 00:08:41,885
Like Zeus riding his thunderbolt
to Mount Vesuvius.

134
00:08:42,195 --> 00:08:44,550
Very amusing, Dad. Offyou go.

135
00:08:44,906 --> 00:08:46,419
Dr Crane.

136
00:08:46,658 --> 00:08:49,331
Dr Webber.
You remember Roz Doyle, of course?

137
00:08:49,619 --> 00:08:50,847
Yes, hello.

138
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:55,565
Who could forget that infectious laugh?

139
00:08:55,834 --> 00:08:58,348
Has anyone had a look at that rash?

140
00:08:58,628 --> 00:09:01,779
- Yes, everybody. Yes.
- Mind if I join you?

141
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:05,082
- Actually, we were just...
- We were hoping you would.

142
00:09:07,512 --> 00:09:11,221
So, Clint, I see that
you're a squash player.

143
00:09:11,558 --> 00:09:14,948
If you're up for a game,
I used to play a bit back in Harvard.

144
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:18,626
I'd love to. Harvard?
I was dying to go to Harvard.

145
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:21,215
I'm sure your school was just as good.

146
00:09:21,485 --> 00:09:24,636
- I went to Oxford.
- Even better.

147
00:09:24,946 --> 00:09:28,621
- Did you go to medical school there?
- Yes, but I took a year off first

148
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:33,421
to get my masters in French history.
Just wanted to do something fun.

149
00:09:33,789 --> 00:09:35,700
So you speak French?

150
00:09:35,957 --> 00:09:40,667
Seulement quand
je rencontre une belle femme.

151
00:09:41,046 --> 00:09:45,085
I understand the importance of time off
before beginning medical school.

152
00:09:45,425 --> 00:09:50,180
I spent that summer in Milan
studying the history of opera.

153
00:09:50,555 --> 00:09:53,274
I had the good fortune
to become friends with

154
00:09:53,558 --> 00:09:57,756
a then little-known young tenor
by the name of Carreras.

155
00:09:58,105 --> 00:10:00,824
- José Carreras?
- Forgive the name dropping.

156
00:10:01,108 --> 00:10:03,906
- He's my godfather.
- You're joking.

157
00:10:04,653 --> 00:10:08,931
No, I'll call him tonight. He'll be
delighted to hear I'm working with you.

158
00:10:09,282 --> 00:10:12,354
I wonder if he remembers
the game we used to play

159
00:10:12,661 --> 00:10:15,971
where we pretended
not to remember one another.

160
00:10:17,749 --> 00:10:22,027
That rash is starting to concern me.
I'll pop and get my medical kit.

161
00:10:22,379 --> 00:10:24,131
There's really no need.

162
00:10:24,381 --> 00:10:27,930
OK, maybe we can get some work done
while he's gone.

163
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:33,175
Roz, for heaven's sake. You behave
like a starry-eyed bobby-soxer.

164
00:10:33,557 --> 00:10:36,993
Yes, the man is good looking.
It's not like he can stop traffic.

165
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,876
There's a blind corner out there.
We don't know if that was him.

166
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,669
How was your squash game?

167
00:10:50,949 --> 00:10:55,545
Dr Webber neglected to mention that
he was squash champion back in college.

168
00:10:56,455 --> 00:10:59,731
- I'm sorry, Frasier.
- Not at all. It was a lovely morning.

169
00:11:00,042 --> 00:11:02,033
Clint treated me to breakfast.

170
00:11:02,294 --> 00:11:05,525
Once we arrived at Le Relais,
the chef had just cut himself.

171
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:07,955
Clint not only treated the wound,

172
00:11:08,216 --> 00:11:11,253
but made us a flawless
egg white and truffle omelette.

173
00:11:11,553 --> 00:11:15,831
I put myself through med school
as a sous-chef at Le Cirque.

174
00:11:16,183 --> 00:11:19,016
I just want to pinch you
to make sure you're real.

175
00:11:19,311 --> 00:11:21,302
He's real.

176
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:25,427
I'm going to get a glass ofwater.
I'll be right back.

177
00:11:25,734 --> 00:11:27,770
But you're about to start the show.

178
00:11:28,028 --> 00:11:31,225
I thought I'd have Clint on,
give his show a leg up.

179
00:11:31,531 --> 00:11:37,288
You're plugging Clint. I'm having
trouble believing this buddy-buddy act.

180
00:11:37,704 --> 00:11:41,583
Try as you mayto insinuate I am
jealous ofthis man, I like Clint.

181
00:11:41,917 --> 00:11:44,954
Why else would I be giving a party
in his honourtonight?

182
00:11:45,253 --> 00:11:47,244
You're on in ten seconds.

183
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:50,304
Slip on those headphones
and follow my lead.

184
00:11:52,469 --> 00:11:56,064
This is Dr Frasier Crane.
Before we start our regular programme,

185
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:59,666
I'd like to introduce you
to Dr Clint Webber.

186
00:11:59,977 --> 00:12:04,528
Clint, you'll probably spend a week
figuring outwhat all these buttons do.

187
00:12:04,898 --> 00:12:08,413
Actually, in college
I ran the radio station.

188
00:12:12,239 --> 00:12:15,390
Things may have gotten
a bit more sophisticated since then.

189
00:12:15,701 --> 00:12:18,340
For instance,
we have here a cough button.

190
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:20,975
If I'm not mistaken,
that's the echo button.

191
00:12:21,248 --> 00:12:23,398
Of course it is.

192
00:12:24,918 --> 00:12:29,309
All my listeners are familiar
with my now trademark echoing cough.

193
00:12:31,466 --> 00:12:36,176
Well, let's go to the lines, take our
first call and show Dr Webber the ropes.

194
00:12:37,681 --> 00:12:41,117
- Go ahead, you're on the air.
- Hi, Dr Crane. It's Marie.

195
00:12:41,435 --> 00:12:44,074
Hello, Marie. I'm listening.

196
00:12:45,355 --> 00:12:48,904
I've been having a hard time
getting out ofbed every morning.

197
00:12:49,234 --> 00:12:52,863
And when I finally do,
I'm irritable for hours.

198
00:12:53,196 --> 00:12:55,426
The desire to stay in bed

199
00:12:55,699 --> 00:13:00,090
is similar
to the desire to regress to the womb.

200
00:13:00,454 --> 00:13:03,844
Some unconscious fear
is driving you to a place of safety.

201
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:06,521
You'll have to examine your life

202
00:13:06,793 --> 00:13:09,591
and discover what it is
you're retreating from.

203
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:14,351
It's hard, but very necessary work.
It may be time to try some therapy.

204
00:13:14,718 --> 00:13:17,676
- Wow.
- You are good, Dr Crane.

205
00:13:17,971 --> 00:13:21,646
The thing that came to my head
was that she might be hypoglycaemic.

206
00:13:21,975 --> 00:13:24,853
I'd have suggested
some protein in the morning.

207
00:13:25,145 --> 00:13:29,696
Wait a minute. Last Thursday I had eggs
for breakfast, and I felt great all day.

208
00:13:30,067 --> 00:13:33,184
- Well, maybe that's it then.
- What a relief.

209
00:13:33,487 --> 00:13:36,047
You scared the life out of me, Dr Crane.

210
00:13:38,533 --> 00:13:40,125
Yes, well, thank you, Marie.

211
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:46,720
All right, I think it's time
to say goodbye to Dr Webber now.

212
00:13:48,293 --> 00:13:50,249
We'll be back after these messages.

213
00:13:50,504 --> 00:13:52,893
- That was fun.
- Yes, it was, wasn't it?

214
00:13:53,173 --> 00:13:55,971
- I hope I wasn't out of line.
- No, not at all.

215
00:13:56,259 --> 00:13:58,898
I always enjoy learning something new.

216
00:13:59,179 --> 00:14:01,534
I'll see you tonight.
Don't be late.

217
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:04,765
- I'm always punctual.
- Of course you are.

218
00:14:07,521 --> 00:14:09,512
I hate him.

219
00:14:15,696 --> 00:14:19,245
He's not here.
A case of that dog food, please.

220
00:14:19,574 --> 00:14:21,963
- Will that be all?
- Yeah, and I'm in a hurry.

221
00:14:22,244 --> 00:14:26,601
Look here. Nickerson's Lemon Biscuits.
These bring back memories.

222
00:14:26,957 --> 00:14:30,267
- Do you carry the raspberry ones?
- I'm not sure.

223
00:14:30,585 --> 00:14:33,463
- Can you come back for those?
- Robert?

224
00:14:35,048 --> 00:14:38,165
Well, look who's come back.

225
00:14:38,468 --> 00:14:42,302
Why don't you just let me pay for this
and get out of here? What do I owe you?

226
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:44,948
I think we both know what you owe me.

227
00:14:46,435 --> 00:14:49,791
I'm sorry. I shouldn't
have made fun ofyour store.

228
00:14:50,105 --> 00:14:52,096
Are you going to let me off the hook?

229
00:14:52,357 --> 00:14:55,394
I'll sell it to you.
I never like to lose a customer.

230
00:14:55,694 --> 00:14:57,924
While I'm here, I'll take a few cases.

231
00:14:58,196 --> 00:15:00,585
We have new varieties
ifyou'd care to look.

232
00:15:00,866 --> 00:15:03,141
- Sure.
- Please, show the man.

233
00:15:06,663 --> 00:15:09,336
I think these biscuits are mismarked.

234
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:14,528
- No, that's correct.
- $14.95? For a package this small?

235
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,714
I see we have another member
of the Price Club.

236
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:22,361
There's no need for that.
Back home I can get these for 80p.

237
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:27,275
- I do have to fly them over.
- Did you buy them a seat on Concorde?

238
00:15:27,643 --> 00:15:30,077
Ifyou cannot afford them,
put them back.

239
00:15:30,354 --> 00:15:32,868
I can bloody well afford them.

240
00:15:33,148 --> 00:15:37,460
- This is robbery.
- Robber? No one calls me robber.

241
00:15:37,819 --> 00:15:39,855
- Robert?
- Not now.

242
00:15:40,113 --> 00:15:44,982
On your way out, a sign on the door
says "please come again". Disregard it.

243
00:15:45,369 --> 00:15:48,520
I'd be happy to.
Mr Crane was right about you.

244
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:52,948
You're nothing but an arrogant,
swindling little cheese-monger.

245
00:15:53,293 --> 00:15:55,523
This is great. I'll take a case of each.

246
00:15:55,796 --> 00:15:57,832
You'll take a case of nothing.

247
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:00,399
- What happened?
- We don't need his food.

248
00:16:00,676 --> 00:16:04,066
Yes, we do.
He's got tarragon flavour now.

249
00:16:04,388 --> 00:16:07,300
- What about Eddie?
- He'll eat when he gets hungry.

250
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:10,238
For heaven sakes,
he drinks out ofthe toilet.

251
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:16,859
So George S Kaufmann so dislikes
what the actor is doing,

252
00:16:17,192 --> 00:16:19,148
he sends a telegram reading,

253
00:16:19,403 --> 00:16:23,954
"I'm watching your performance from the
rear of the house. Wish you were here."

254
00:16:25,826 --> 00:16:28,659
I believe
that's the story you meant to tell.

255
00:16:28,954 --> 00:16:30,945
Thanks for helping out.

256
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:34,843
Doc, great way to welcome the new guy.

257
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:39,040
I'm surprised you're even here.
I didn't think you cared much for Clint.

258
00:16:39,381 --> 00:16:42,020
I'm over that.
I figured he can't nab every chick,

259
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:45,896
so ifwe pal around,
I bag the leftovers.

260
00:16:47,347 --> 00:16:49,941
You're a regular busboy of romance.
Excuse me.

261
00:16:55,439 --> 00:16:57,236
- Niles.
- How's it going?

262
00:16:57,482 --> 00:17:00,599
Let me see. What have you missed?

263
00:17:00,902 --> 00:17:05,100
Clint told us about how he learned to
fly a plane, then he recited a sonnet.

264
00:17:05,449 --> 00:17:10,603
Then he fixed my ice machine and he
invented a new drink, the pink Webber.

265
00:17:10,996 --> 00:17:13,464
I've got Daphne
drawing a bath right now.

266
00:17:13,749 --> 00:17:18,027
Ifthe party starts to lag, I can invite
him to walk on water to liven things up.

267
00:17:18,378 --> 00:17:20,369
Don't let it make you crazy.

268
00:17:20,631 --> 00:17:23,623
At some point we all run
into someone who's our superior.

269
00:17:23,925 --> 00:17:26,803
I've never dealt
with this sort of thing before.

270
00:17:27,095 --> 00:17:28,210
Never?

271
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:32,981
As my younger brother, you've dealt
with this sort of thing all your life.

272
00:17:33,727 --> 00:17:37,003
At least he won't outshine you
in the egomania department.

273
00:17:37,314 --> 00:17:40,272
Sorry. Yes, I'm being silly
about this, I suppose.

274
00:17:40,567 --> 00:17:45,436
I just wish I could find one flaw,
one area where I'm his superior.

275
00:17:45,822 --> 00:17:49,861
I'm sure you will although
it won't be in the drink department.

276
00:17:50,202 --> 00:17:52,557
This is heaven in a glass.

277
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:56,299
I was just admiring
this chessboard. It's beautiful.

278
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:58,335
Thank you. Do you play?

279
00:17:58,585 --> 00:18:00,860
No. Are you in the middle of a match?

280
00:18:01,129 --> 00:18:05,486
Yes, as a matter offact, I'm playing
by mail with a Russian grandmaster.

281
00:18:05,842 --> 00:18:08,561
- It's quite challenging.
- Congratulations.

282
00:18:08,845 --> 00:18:10,961
With your use
ofthe Zekrepsky Attack,

283
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:14,021
you're only four moves away
from certain victory.

284
00:18:14,851 --> 00:18:17,968
You're right. And, actually,
I'd be happy to hear that,

285
00:18:18,271 --> 00:18:22,423
except I'm playing black.
Well, wasn't that a fun eight months?

286
00:18:22,776 --> 00:18:23,765
Excuse me.

287
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:30,428
Hello, Sharon. Sorry we haven't
had a chance to speak much.

288
00:18:30,742 --> 00:18:33,131
I'm looking forward
to our date on Friday.

289
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:37,041
So am l. You look...
absolutely beautiful.

290
00:18:37,374 --> 00:18:38,932
Or should I say...

291
00:18:43,547 --> 00:18:45,538
Why? What's so funny?

292
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:48,597
You just told me
I'm as lovely as a chicken beak.

293
00:18:48,885 --> 00:18:50,000
Really?

294
00:18:52,681 --> 00:18:54,911
Who's as lovely as a chicken beak?

295
00:18:56,727 --> 00:18:59,082
You speak Mandarin?

296
00:19:07,946 --> 00:19:10,506
I just wanted to thank you
for this party.

297
00:19:10,782 --> 00:19:12,340
Don't mention it.

298
00:19:12,576 --> 00:19:16,125
It's been a perfect evening.
The hors d'oeuvres, the company,

299
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:18,446
the music. I love this song.

300
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:21,869
Well, enjoy.

301
00:19:33,847 --> 00:19:35,565
I'm sorry. I was singing too loud.

302
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:39,322
No, not at all. I can't tell you
how much I'm enjoying hearing it.

303
00:19:40,562 --> 00:19:43,759
Careful, it doesn't take much coaxing
to get me to perform.

304
00:19:44,066 --> 00:19:45,101
Really?

305
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:48,673
Get a glass ofwine in me,
I'm serenading the entire room.

306
00:19:48,987 --> 00:19:50,306
Really?

307
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:53,442
I'm afraid I have a bit
ofthe old ham in me.

308
00:19:53,742 --> 00:19:56,939
Would it be presumptuous to sing
in front ofyour guests?

309
00:19:57,245 --> 00:20:01,284
I thinkwe could persuade
the piano playerto play it again.

310
00:20:03,043 --> 00:20:06,877
Niles, I've done it.
I have found his Achilles' heel.

311
00:20:07,214 --> 00:20:10,012
- Whose?
- Clint's. I just heard him singing.

312
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:14,054
He's tone-deaf. He's about to sing
a rendition of Isn't It Romantic?

313
00:20:14,388 --> 00:20:17,107
that will simply
peel the enamel from your teeth.

314
00:20:18,809 --> 00:20:21,198
Are you sure
you want to let him do that?

315
00:20:21,478 --> 00:20:24,436
- What do you mean?
- You're a wonderful singer.

316
00:20:24,731 --> 00:20:28,883
Isn't it enough to know that? Do you
need to see him humiliate himself?

317
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,094
Yes.

318
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:34,559
- Now, Frasier...
- No, you're right.

319
00:20:34,825 --> 00:20:37,703
I guess I am a bigger man than that.

320
00:20:37,995 --> 00:20:40,555
Dr Crane, your friend
Clint's quite a charmer.

321
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:43,743
- Yes, he is, isn't he?
- Do you suppose he's single?

322
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:46,317
I was going to give him my phone number.

323
00:20:46,586 --> 00:20:50,977
Excuse me, I just want to thank you all
for this warm welcome to KACL.

324
00:20:51,341 --> 00:20:55,380
And, as a token of my gratitude,
I'd like to share this song with you.

325
00:20:55,721 --> 00:21:00,556
- Clint, there's been a change in plans.
- Yes, I'm going to accompany you now.

326
00:21:00,934 --> 00:21:02,572
Get up.

327
00:21:17,534 --> 00:21:20,526
Please, everybody. Nobody's perfect.
