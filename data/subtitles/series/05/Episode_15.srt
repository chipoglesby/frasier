1
00:00:11,084 --> 00:00:13,234
Geez, look at this stuff.

2
00:00:13,503 --> 00:00:19,021
Golden Sunset Retirement Village.
Investments for Seniors.

3
00:00:19,426 --> 00:00:23,658
Willowbrook Mortuary.
What the hell kind of list am I on?

4
00:00:24,014 --> 00:00:28,371
The good news is I don't think it's the
kind of list they keep you on very long.

5
00:00:28,727 --> 00:00:33,482
Ever since I turned 65, all I get is
geezer mail. It's very depressing.

6
00:00:33,857 --> 00:00:37,691
The only thing depressing about
being a geezer is looking like one.

7
00:00:38,028 --> 00:00:40,747
There's things a person can do
to look younger.

8
00:00:41,031 --> 00:00:44,785
- How he dresses...
- I tried those Jordache jeans.

9
00:00:45,118 --> 00:00:48,508
I just think you ought
to leave something to the imagination.

10
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:52,140
There's always your hair.
I know it's not exactly your style,

11
00:00:52,459 --> 00:00:55,576
but there's nothing wrong
with covering up that grey.

12
00:00:55,879 --> 00:00:58,837
I know just the right shade for you.
Cinnamon sable.

13
00:01:01,051 --> 00:01:04,282
Cinnamon sable? Sounds nice.

14
00:01:05,347 --> 00:01:07,338
Wait, I couldn't use that.

15
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:10,557
That's Duke's shade.
He'd scratch my eyes out.

16
00:01:12,688 --> 00:01:15,361
- Hello, Niles.
- Frasier, prepare to salivate.

17
00:01:15,649 --> 00:01:18,959
If that is a picture
ofyour new Biedermeier loveseat,

18
00:01:19,278 --> 00:01:21,314
you've already shown it to me.

19
00:01:21,572 --> 00:01:23,688
This is a photo of my latest purchase.

20
00:01:23,949 --> 00:01:28,227
An exquisite 18th century Turkish
prayer rug. Paid a fortune for it,

21
00:01:28,579 --> 00:01:32,333
but legend says whatever you pray for
on this rug will come to you.

22
00:01:32,666 --> 00:01:34,736
It certainly worked for the dealer.

23
00:01:37,588 --> 00:01:40,978
I'm sorry, Niles,
I'm just not in the best of moods.

24
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,939
I had another disastrous
blind date today.

25
00:01:44,219 --> 00:01:45,254
I'm sorry.

26
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:48,303
Murderers on Death Row
can find women to marry them.

27
00:01:49,975 --> 00:01:53,126
I can't find one
to sit through coffee with me.

28
00:01:53,437 --> 00:01:55,428
It's easy for them to attract women.

29
00:01:55,689 --> 00:01:58,442
They have all that time
to work out in the yard.

30
00:01:58,734 --> 00:02:01,294
I'm serious. I'm getting desperate here.

31
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:04,289
My love life's
not much better than yours,

32
00:02:04,573 --> 00:02:07,133
but you don't see me
going off the deep end.

33
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:10,845
Did it ever occur to you that
this recent antique buying binge

34
00:02:11,163 --> 00:02:15,714
is nothing but a way of sublimating
your frustrated sexual desires?

35
00:02:16,084 --> 00:02:18,962
These purchases
have nothing to do with sex.

36
00:02:19,254 --> 00:02:22,132
Don't they? In addition
to the loveseat, let's see,

37
00:02:22,424 --> 00:02:26,417
your most recent acquisitions
have been a French bedwarmer,

38
00:02:26,762 --> 00:02:30,550
a pair of toby jugs,

39
00:02:30,891 --> 00:02:33,883
the less said
about that Civil War ramrod, the better.

40
00:02:36,605 --> 00:02:40,678
You Freudians.
Sometimes a ramrod is just a...

41
00:02:41,026 --> 00:02:43,984
Hell, even I can't make that one fly.

42
00:02:44,279 --> 00:02:46,395
Take heart.
We're both in the same boat.

43
00:02:46,657 --> 00:02:49,649
But where do you go to meet people?

44
00:02:49,952 --> 00:02:53,547
Just yesterday
I met a very nice man at the grocery.

45
00:02:53,872 --> 00:02:56,261
He asked me
if I was free Saturday night.

46
00:02:56,542 --> 00:02:59,102
He said, "Wait,
that's me niece's Bat Mitzvah".

47
00:02:59,378 --> 00:03:03,690
I said I've never been to a Bat Mitzvah.
He asked me to go to the Bat Mitzvah.

48
00:03:04,049 --> 00:03:06,438
I said I'd love to go
to the Bat Mitzvah. So...

49
00:03:06,718 --> 00:03:08,151
- Daphne?
- Yes?

50
00:03:08,387 --> 00:03:11,459
Nothing. I'm sorry. Go on.

51
00:03:11,765 --> 00:03:16,964
I seem to have lost me train of thought.
Anyone like some tea?

52
00:03:17,354 --> 00:03:19,549
- Love some. Thank you.
- Thank you, yes.

53
00:03:20,941 --> 00:03:24,411
Little trick I discovered
a few weeks ago. It's a lifesaver.

54
00:03:24,736 --> 00:03:30,606
Anyway, as I was saying, where
does one go to meet available women?

55
00:03:31,618 --> 00:03:33,848
There are singles bars, of course.

56
00:03:34,121 --> 00:03:37,750
- We could join a health club.
- There's a splendid idea.

57
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:41,553
I can just picture the two of us,
tank tops and spandex.

58
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:45,349
With matching headbands,
we might as well sterilise ourselves.

59
00:03:45,674 --> 00:03:50,270
Sounds like fun, Daph.
If she says Bat Mitzvah one more time...

60
00:03:51,889 --> 00:03:53,368
- Hey, Niles.
- Hey, Dad.

61
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,635
You come up with an idea.

62
00:03:55,893 --> 00:03:59,363
- What are you guys talking about?
- Our pathetic love lives.

63
00:03:59,688 --> 00:04:03,920
Why don't you do what my buddies and
I did when we were hard up for dates?

64
00:04:04,276 --> 00:04:06,267
Invade Korea?

65
00:04:10,657 --> 00:04:13,091
No, we'd throw a party
with just one rule.

66
00:04:13,368 --> 00:04:15,836
Only single, available people
were invited.

67
00:04:16,121 --> 00:04:19,318
I don't know, Dad.
That doesn't really sound like us.

68
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:24,176
It works. I used to throw one a month.
People used to call them Marty parties.

69
00:04:24,546 --> 00:04:28,539
People would call me and say,
"Marty, when's the next Marty party?"

70
00:04:28,884 --> 00:04:33,162
"lsn't it time for another Marty party?"
"Had a great time at the last one".

71
00:04:33,513 --> 00:04:34,832
- Dad?
- Yeah?

72
00:04:35,057 --> 00:04:38,208
I'm sorry. Nothing.

73
00:04:38,518 --> 00:04:41,954
Or somebody might say,
"Can I host the next Marty party?"

74
00:04:42,272 --> 00:04:44,263
Doesn't always work.

75
00:04:44,524 --> 00:04:47,402
I don't think
we're quite hard up enough yet

76
00:04:47,694 --> 00:04:51,050
- to stage a singles party.
- OK, suit yourself.

77
00:04:51,365 --> 00:04:55,358
We'll just get ready for the evening.
I'll dish out the spaghetti

78
00:04:55,702 --> 00:05:00,492
and you guys set up the card table.
I got us a new jigsaw puzzle.

79
00:05:00,874 --> 00:05:02,865
10,000 pieces.

80
00:05:03,961 --> 00:05:06,919
It's called "The Wheat Field".

81
00:05:13,053 --> 00:05:15,965
- I'll send the invitations.
- I'll call the caterer.

82
00:05:27,776 --> 00:05:30,085
Hello, welcome. Please come in.

83
00:05:30,362 --> 00:05:33,593
This is wonderful.
I had no idea we'd get such a turnout.

84
00:05:33,907 --> 00:05:37,820
Everywhere I look there's another woman
I want to get to know better.

85
00:05:38,161 --> 00:05:40,629
With some obvious exceptions.

86
00:05:40,914 --> 00:05:43,951
- Roz, I didn't know you were coming.
- I know it's a long shot

87
00:05:44,251 --> 00:05:48,164
but I figured I better get out and
do a little flirting or I'd forget how.

88
00:05:49,131 --> 00:05:52,328
- Can I offer you something?
- Yeah...

89
00:05:57,014 --> 00:05:59,244
Roz, you are rusty.

90
00:06:00,726 --> 00:06:03,001
I know you've been striking out lately,

91
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:06,421
but I invited someone
who'll improve your batting average.

92
00:06:06,732 --> 00:06:08,768
I've already met someone captivating.

93
00:06:09,026 --> 00:06:10,744
- Hi, Roz.
- Tina, you made it.

94
00:06:10,986 --> 00:06:14,535
You know me.
Have I ever said no to a good time?

95
00:06:14,865 --> 00:06:17,140
That's what I was trying
to tell Frasier.

96
00:06:18,243 --> 00:06:20,757
Tina Kramer, meet Dr Frasier Crane.

97
00:06:21,038 --> 00:06:24,314
- Doctor, huh?
- Yes, that's right. Roz?

98
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:26,695
Strong hands.

99
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,919
I guess it's true what they say,
strong hands, strong mind.

100
00:06:31,256 --> 00:06:35,135
That's why you'll never see an
unopened pickle jar at a Mensa meeting.

101
00:06:38,805 --> 00:06:40,318
Excuse me, I'm sorry.

102
00:06:41,475 --> 00:06:43,193
Oh, excuse me.

103
00:06:45,854 --> 00:06:46,843
Martin?

104
00:06:49,566 --> 00:06:52,797
- You're looking at my hair, right?
- Yeah. Looks great.

105
00:06:53,111 --> 00:06:55,102
Thanks. Yeah, I did it myself.

106
00:06:55,364 --> 00:06:57,958
- Get out.
- Yeah, really.

107
00:06:58,242 --> 00:07:01,200
Well, Daphne suggested it.
And at first I said no way,

108
00:07:01,495 --> 00:07:03,884
but then I thought
a lot of other guys do it.

109
00:07:04,164 --> 00:07:07,679
What better place to try it
than here where nobody knows who I am.

110
00:07:08,001 --> 00:07:09,480
You look great, too.

111
00:07:09,711 --> 00:07:13,181
I was really happy with this dress.
You can't tell I'm pregnant.

112
00:07:13,507 --> 00:07:16,021
I know. Real nice.

113
00:07:17,427 --> 00:07:21,784
You have a good time at the party and
the dress looks great. Nobody'd know.

114
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:24,734
Same with your hair.
It's completely natural.

115
00:07:32,568 --> 00:07:34,604
- Hey, Niles.
- Hey, Dad.

116
00:07:34,861 --> 00:07:38,058
Watch that "Dad" business.
Got a few ladies around here

117
00:07:38,365 --> 00:07:40,799
thinking I just might be your brother.

118
00:07:41,076 --> 00:07:43,954
Yeah, it's like looking in a mirror.

119
00:07:44,246 --> 00:07:46,521
- Aren't you having fun?
- Sort of.

120
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:51,022
It's been so long since I've been single
it's hard to strike up conversations.

121
00:07:51,378 --> 00:07:56,088
You just need a little confidence.
Watch this.

122
00:07:56,466 --> 00:07:58,218
- Hi there.
- Hi.

123
00:07:58,468 --> 00:08:03,462
I'm Marty Crane. And this is my son,
Niles. Yep, my son.

124
00:08:05,225 --> 00:08:07,944
Hi, Vicky Cantrell. You're the host.

125
00:08:08,228 --> 00:08:10,788
I was admiring
your beautiful Turkish rug.

126
00:08:11,064 --> 00:08:13,897
- Thank you.
- Is that 18th century?

127
00:08:14,192 --> 00:08:16,342
Yes, it is. You have quite an eye.

128
00:08:16,612 --> 00:08:20,287
I work for an auction house. I'd
love to see some ofyour other pieces.

129
00:08:20,616 --> 00:08:24,734
It would be my pleasure. There's
an absurd old legend about that rug,

130
00:08:25,078 --> 00:08:27,353
that whatever you pray for...

131
00:08:27,623 --> 00:08:30,183
Well, perhaps
it's not that absurd after all.

132
00:08:31,501 --> 00:08:33,890
Roz, that woman is all over me.

133
00:08:34,171 --> 00:08:36,731
Didn't you get
what I was trying to tell you?

134
00:08:37,007 --> 00:08:39,965
Yes. I also got it when she showed me
how she can tie a knot

135
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:43,172
- in a cherry stem with her tongue.
- That's a party trick.

136
00:08:43,472 --> 00:08:46,066
The cherry was in my mouth at the time.

137
00:08:47,851 --> 00:08:50,160
I tried to tell you
that I met a woman tonight.

138
00:08:50,437 --> 00:08:52,826
- All right, I'll go talk to her.
- Thank you.

139
00:08:53,941 --> 00:08:55,294
- Frasier.
- Niles.

140
00:08:55,525 --> 00:08:58,164
I just met the most fabulous woman.

141
00:08:58,445 --> 00:09:01,676
That's fabulous.
I also met someone who's terrific.

142
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:04,743
Wait, I can't wait.
I have to show you mine first.

143
00:09:05,035 --> 00:09:07,708
- She's over by the buffet.
- So is mine.

144
00:09:09,164 --> 00:09:11,553
At what point
would you like to acknowledge

145
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:14,142
that we're both waving
at the same woman?

146
00:09:15,837 --> 00:09:17,236
I saw her first.

147
00:09:17,464 --> 00:09:20,058
You're the host. You see everyone first.

148
00:09:20,342 --> 00:09:24,176
- There are plenty of other women here.
- Exactly. So go pick one.

149
00:09:24,513 --> 00:09:29,223
Let's stop this. The civilised thing to
do is for us to both stay away from her.

150
00:09:29,601 --> 00:09:33,514
We are psychiatrists, not a couple
of rutting pigs in a barnyard.

151
00:09:33,855 --> 00:09:36,050
What do you say to that?

152
00:09:37,067 --> 00:09:38,659
Sooey.

153
00:09:41,446 --> 00:09:43,835
- Very well. May the better man win.
- Fine.

154
00:09:44,116 --> 00:09:47,108
- Frasier, your father wants you.
- Advantage Niles.

155
00:09:50,539 --> 00:09:54,532
I want you to meet a big fan of yours.
Kathy Locker, Dr Frasier Crane.

156
00:09:54,877 --> 00:09:59,951
I love your show.
You're such a good listener.

157
00:10:00,591 --> 00:10:04,266
Just yesterday you gave the best advice
to that woman who called in

158
00:10:04,595 --> 00:10:07,951
about a problem with her teenage son.
What was it you said?

159
00:10:08,265 --> 00:10:12,702
What do I ever say? You're in denial.
Seek help. Whatever. Blah, blah, blah.

160
00:10:14,813 --> 00:10:18,806
- He's different from what I expected.
- He's not what I expected either,

161
00:10:19,151 --> 00:10:21,028
but you get used to it.

162
00:10:21,278 --> 00:10:25,191
You were telling me
about being a detective.

163
00:10:25,532 --> 00:10:28,285
Do you feel like getting a drink?

164
00:10:28,577 --> 00:10:31,489
- That would be nice, Marty.
- OK.

165
00:10:38,921 --> 00:10:41,640
You know,
this is such a prime spot here.

166
00:10:41,924 --> 00:10:45,280
maybe one of us should stay here
and the other one get the drinks.

167
00:10:45,594 --> 00:10:46,947
You're right.

168
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:49,170
So I'll have a beer.

169
00:10:51,308 --> 00:10:52,866
OK.

170
00:10:54,144 --> 00:10:56,419
I think I lost an earring.

171
00:10:56,688 --> 00:10:58,679
There it is, by my foot.

172
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:05,428
There you go.

173
00:11:07,491 --> 00:11:09,561
Thanks. Enjoy the party.

174
00:11:14,248 --> 00:11:17,445
- These egg rolls are delicious.
- I made them myself.

175
00:11:17,751 --> 00:11:21,107
Really? A psychiatrist and a chef.
Impressive.

176
00:11:21,421 --> 00:11:23,810
They both came in handy
when I cured the ham.

177
00:11:26,093 --> 00:11:29,403
Hello, Niles.
There's an emergency in the kitchen.

178
00:11:29,721 --> 00:11:33,919
Very cagey, Frasier. Why don't
you just run out and yell "fire"?

179
00:11:34,268 --> 00:11:36,907
- Excuse me, Vicky, for a moment.
- Of course.

180
00:11:39,523 --> 00:11:42,879
- Is it a serious problem?
- No, he's always run like that.

181
00:11:48,031 --> 00:11:50,340
You mean the kitchen.
He can handle it.

182
00:11:50,617 --> 00:11:54,246
- You two seem very close.
- Yes. I'm his best friend.

183
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:57,458
Well, his only friend, really.

184
00:11:58,208 --> 00:12:00,642
That surprises me.
He seems very outgoing.

185
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:05,276
Doesn't he, though? Yes, the medication
seems to be working wonders.

186
00:12:05,632 --> 00:12:08,783
I just hope he sticks with it this time.

187
00:12:09,094 --> 00:12:11,369
Shall we hit the buffet?

188
00:12:12,723 --> 00:12:16,033
- What a great story.
- Thanks. This is fun.

189
00:12:16,351 --> 00:12:18,581
I usually hate these kinds of parties.

190
00:12:18,854 --> 00:12:21,243
Me, too.
People are always so superficial.

191
00:12:21,523 --> 00:12:25,562
Yeah, it seems like everybody nowadays
is all about appearances.

192
00:12:25,903 --> 00:12:28,417
- Shall we get a drink?
- Yeah, sure.

193
00:12:32,576 --> 00:12:35,010
- I'm not really very thirsty.
- Me, either.

194
00:12:37,539 --> 00:12:40,736
Then I top it offwith brandied cherries
and crème fraîche.

195
00:12:41,043 --> 00:12:42,032
Frasier.

196
00:12:42,252 --> 00:12:44,971
I'm telling Vicky
my recipe for crépe gâteau.

197
00:12:45,255 --> 00:12:48,372
I'm sure she's had enough
ofyour crépe by now.

198
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:52,452
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but Dad needs you, Frasier.

199
00:12:52,763 --> 00:12:54,754
- No, he doesn't.
- I think he might.

200
00:12:56,141 --> 00:12:58,860
All right, then. Ifyou will excuse me.

201
00:12:59,686 --> 00:13:01,677
Do you live with your father?

202
00:13:01,939 --> 00:13:06,091
No. A grown man live with his father?
Frasier lives with Dad.

203
00:13:07,069 --> 00:13:08,422
Champagne?

204
00:13:08,654 --> 00:13:11,726
Get me home.
Something's happening with my hair dye.

205
00:13:12,032 --> 00:13:15,069
It's melting. Look at this stain.
It must look terrible.

206
00:13:15,369 --> 00:13:21,160
No, it looks terrific. Maybe the fire
is making you perspire a bit. Here.

207
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:30,748
You look quite young and attractive.
Yes, by the warmth ofthe fire glow,

208
00:13:31,134 --> 00:13:35,730
I'd say that you actually look like
you're back in your "Marty party" days.

209
00:13:36,098 --> 00:13:39,727
You're not BS-ing me?
OK, then, I'll stay.

210
00:13:41,603 --> 00:13:44,834
- Vicky, hello. Where's Niles?
- He had to take a call.

211
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:47,757
That's terrific.

212
00:13:48,652 --> 00:13:52,770
Would you like to find someplace
where we could talk? No interruptions.

213
00:13:53,115 --> 00:13:55,106
- Frasier...
- Not now, Roz.

214
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:58,564
- Can't you see I'm busy?
- My water just broke.

215
00:14:00,247 --> 00:14:03,000
Maybe you sat in something.

216
00:14:03,292 --> 00:14:06,011
Oh, my God!
What's all over my Turkish prayer rug?

217
00:14:07,671 --> 00:14:10,583
- You've got to get me to a hospital.
- Yes, of course.

218
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:14,353
Vicky, ifyou'll excuse us,
my friend Roz just went into labour.

219
00:14:14,678 --> 00:14:16,714
- How exciting! Good luck.
- Thanks.

220
00:14:16,972 --> 00:14:20,408
Wait one second.
This may not be an appropriate moment

221
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:23,638
but perhaps you'd like
to have dinner with me sometime?

222
00:14:23,937 --> 00:14:27,134
That's sweet ofyou,
but I'm not really interested.

223
00:14:27,441 --> 00:14:29,796
Thank you for your honesty.

224
00:14:30,068 --> 00:14:34,186
What is wrong with me? Why can't I find
a woman who's interested in me?

225
00:14:34,531 --> 00:14:38,888
Those are two different questions
so we should talk them both over.

226
00:14:39,244 --> 00:14:41,997
Wait, I can't. Because I'm in labour!

227
00:14:49,713 --> 00:14:50,907
How did we do?

228
00:14:51,131 --> 00:14:53,247
This time it's hot and it's got cream.

229
00:14:53,508 --> 00:14:55,624
Of course, it's still chicken soup.

230
00:14:56,845 --> 00:14:59,757
Who needs coffee when we can keep alert

231
00:15:00,057 --> 00:15:03,333
by perusing these
very up-to-date magazines?

232
00:15:03,644 --> 00:15:07,353
Look, Dad. That cute Tricia Nixon's
getting married.

233
00:15:09,775 --> 00:15:13,563
Excuse me, may we get an update
on Roz Doyle?

234
00:15:13,904 --> 00:15:17,101
Sure. She is still in early labour.
Hang in there.

235
00:15:18,158 --> 00:15:20,592
She's pretty.
I should make a play for her.

236
00:15:20,869 --> 00:15:24,464
Considering how young and attractive
I am tonight.

237
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:27,020
I said I was sorry.

238
00:15:27,918 --> 00:15:30,671
Not half as sorry as
when I ran over that speed bump

239
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:33,636
and you left a headprint
on the ceiling of my BMW.

240
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:36,244
Hello.

241
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:38,663
Niles, didn't expect to see you here.

242
00:15:38,929 --> 00:15:42,683
The doorman found Roz's purse in
the lobby. I thought she might need it.

243
00:15:43,016 --> 00:15:46,372
I suppose you also came to gloat.
You got Vicky, I didn't.

244
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:49,884
Neither of us got Vicky.
She went home with the bartender.

245
00:15:51,149 --> 00:15:52,343
Really?

246
00:15:52,568 --> 00:15:56,607
Well, you know what I say? Her loss.

247
00:15:56,947 --> 00:16:00,303
Absolutely right. Her loss.

248
00:16:00,617 --> 00:16:04,371
Has saying that
ever made you feel any better?

249
00:16:04,705 --> 00:16:06,138
Not a whit.

250
00:16:06,373 --> 00:16:08,489
It's been a hell of a night
for all of us.

251
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:11,867
It certainly was for me.
I lost Vicky, my rug is ruined,

252
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:14,889
someone left weird brown stains
on my wing chair.

253
00:16:19,595 --> 00:16:20,584
Hello.

254
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:26,026
I came down as soon as I heard.
What the hell happened to your hair?

255
00:16:26,393 --> 00:16:28,987
I coloured it just like you told me to.

256
00:16:29,271 --> 00:16:31,262
This isn't cinnamon sable.

257
00:16:31,523 --> 00:16:34,356
I couldn't use that.
It had a woman's picture on the box.

258
00:16:34,651 --> 00:16:39,600
I used some stuff called Color In A Can.
It said just spray on and go.

259
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:43,949
- How did I know it was a lousy product?
- If only there had been some clue.

260
00:16:46,288 --> 00:16:49,485
Don't you start on me.
You had me melting by that fire.

261
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:53,306
Wait a minute. You're the one
who left stains on my wing chair.

262
00:16:54,296 --> 00:16:57,129
I was wondering when you'd crack that,
Miss Marple.

263
00:16:57,424 --> 00:16:59,858
Don't start with me.

264
00:17:00,135 --> 00:17:05,255
Stop it! What is wrong with you?
Our friend is having a baby in there.

265
00:17:05,641 --> 00:17:10,078
We've all had dreadful evenings
but we should be thinking about Roz.

266
00:17:10,437 --> 00:17:11,552
Exactly.

267
00:17:12,814 --> 00:17:16,648
Besides, nobody could have had
as horrendous an evening as I did.

268
00:17:16,985 --> 00:17:20,864
I got stood up at a Bat Mitzvah.
I waited there an hour.

269
00:17:21,198 --> 00:17:23,666
He left a lame excuse on the machine,

270
00:17:23,951 --> 00:17:28,069
but if he thinks he's got another chance
with me, he's meshuggah.

271
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,594
Oh, boo hoo, anyway.
At least you had a date tonight.

272
00:17:37,923 --> 00:17:40,801
And at least your apartment
wasn't decimated.

273
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:44,324
I went to a party tonight
with shoe polish on my hair.

274
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:51,042
That's it. Breathe. You're doing great.

275
00:17:51,311 --> 00:17:52,744
Take care, honey.

276
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,254
Good luck.

277
00:17:54,481 --> 00:17:55,834
We love you.

278
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:05,978
She's very tired, so
I'll have to ask you to make it quick.

279
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:09,553
Roz, congratulations.

280
00:18:10,747 --> 00:18:12,339
Look at her.

281
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:14,460
She is beautiful.

282
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:16,109
Mazel tov.

283
00:18:18,422 --> 00:18:19,980
It's a long story.

284
00:18:20,215 --> 00:18:21,807
So, what's her name?

285
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:24,689
Alice. Alice May Doyle.

286
00:18:25,721 --> 00:18:29,999
My daughter. My God,
that's the first time I ever said that.

287
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:33,422
You look great. How do you feel?

288
00:18:33,729 --> 00:18:36,323
Fine. I'm just a little tired.

289
00:18:36,607 --> 00:18:39,599
Maybe we should go.
I'll drop by and see you tomorrow.

290
00:18:39,902 --> 00:18:43,497
I sure would love to hold her
for just a second.

291
00:18:43,822 --> 00:18:47,132
Maybe we should just wait
until you're not dripping toxins.

292
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:53,127
We'll see you, then. OK. Bye.

293
00:18:53,415 --> 00:18:56,407
- Congratulations.
- I'll be along in a second.

294
00:18:58,378 --> 00:19:00,573
Roz, congratulations again.

295
00:19:01,298 --> 00:19:05,610
I'm so proud of you.
Your little girl is just perfect.

296
00:19:05,969 --> 00:19:07,960
She is, isn't she?

297
00:19:10,933 --> 00:19:15,290
- My God, look at your face.
- I must look real lovely.

298
00:19:15,646 --> 00:19:18,683
Yes, that's exactly how you look.
Lovely.

299
00:19:18,982 --> 00:19:24,579
I don't think I've ever seen a face
more purely happy than right now.

300
00:19:26,657 --> 00:19:28,329
Little Alice,

301
00:19:28,575 --> 00:19:32,090
how I wish you could wake up right now

302
00:19:32,412 --> 00:19:34,767
and see how beautiful your mother looks.

303
00:19:39,169 --> 00:19:41,558
Then again, you need your rest.

304
00:19:45,884 --> 00:19:47,078
You did great, honey.

305
00:19:52,224 --> 00:19:53,657
Sleep well.

306
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:57,126
- Well, hello.
- Hi.

307
00:19:58,981 --> 00:20:03,497
This may be an odd time to ask you this
but I was convinced

308
00:20:03,861 --> 00:20:07,331
that we sort of made
some eye contact in the waiting room.

309
00:20:07,656 --> 00:20:10,250
I was wondering if I could
get your number?

310
00:20:10,534 --> 00:20:14,163
- But what about your...?
- Forget about her. She's asleep.

311
00:20:14,496 --> 00:20:17,056
What kind of monster are you?

312
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:24,161
Her loss.
