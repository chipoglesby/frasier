1
00:00:11,568 --> 00:00:13,399
Well, I should warn you,

2
00:00:13,653 --> 00:00:16,770
ifwe hitturbulence,
I may hold onto you for dear life.

3
00:00:17,073 --> 00:00:20,463
Well, I should warn you,
I'm hoping for a bumpy ride.

4
00:00:22,912 --> 00:00:25,301
So, why are you going to Acapulco?

5
00:00:25,582 --> 00:00:28,460
Actually, it's rather an amusing story.

6
00:00:28,752 --> 00:00:33,872
I came down to the airport on sort
of a blind date with a cello player.

7
00:00:34,257 --> 00:00:38,614
She didn't know it was a blind date.
Actually, it was all in my head.

8
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:43,361
So when I bumped into you
and you said you were going to Acapulco,

9
00:00:43,725 --> 00:00:45,602
I thought, why not tag along?

10
00:00:45,852 --> 00:00:50,164
So the only reason you're on this plane
is because of me?

11
00:00:50,523 --> 00:00:52,036
Call it kismet.

12
00:00:52,275 --> 00:00:54,186
- Can I switch seats?
- Sure.

13
00:00:54,444 --> 00:00:57,720
You're lucky.
Normally this flight is jammed.

14
00:00:58,031 --> 00:01:00,022
See, kismet.

15
00:01:08,625 --> 00:01:11,264
I didn't mean to eavesdrop,
but I have to say,

16
00:01:11,544 --> 00:01:14,536
I'd be flattered if someone
got on a plane to be with me.

17
00:01:14,839 --> 00:01:15,874
- Really?
- Yeah.

18
00:01:16,091 --> 00:01:18,400
What could be more romantic than that?

19
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:22,457
It's awkward trying to talk like this.
Is that seat taken?

20
00:01:22,764 --> 00:01:25,483
No. Come sit here, please.

21
00:01:30,772 --> 00:01:33,161
Pardon me. Sorry. Thank you.

22
00:01:35,151 --> 00:01:37,870
At last. Well, I'm Frasier Crane.

23
00:01:38,154 --> 00:01:40,349
- Felicity Stafford.
- It's a pleasure.

24
00:01:40,615 --> 00:01:42,845
And this is my husband, David.

25
00:01:45,078 --> 00:01:46,557
A genuine pleasure.

26
00:01:51,793 --> 00:01:55,786
Oh, darn. I forgot to order
my kosher meal.

27
00:01:56,506 --> 00:01:57,700
Excuse me.

28
00:01:57,924 --> 00:01:58,959
So sorry.

29
00:01:59,175 --> 00:02:01,131
Pardon me.
I'm so sorry.

30
00:02:01,386 --> 00:02:03,661
Well, it was lovely meeting you both.

31
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:05,648
Stewardess...

32
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:08,563
Oh, thank you. Bless you.

33
00:02:18,361 --> 00:02:20,352
Oh, thank God the flight's late.

34
00:02:20,614 --> 00:02:23,367
I was sure I'd missed it. Thank you.

35
00:02:35,962 --> 00:02:39,841
Yes, it's me. It's amazing what they
can do with make-up and lighting.

36
00:02:40,175 --> 00:02:42,564
Yes, it is amazing.

37
00:02:42,844 --> 00:02:45,404
Not that they
didn't have plenty to workwith.

38
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,878
By "plenty" I don't mean anything,
you know, referring to, well, you know.

39
00:02:50,226 --> 00:02:52,615
You stay there. I'll change seats.

40
00:02:52,896 --> 00:02:55,933
No, wait.
Your voice sounds really familiar.

41
00:02:56,232 --> 00:02:58,348
Dr Frasier Crane, from the radio.

42
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:01,807
- Kelly Easterbrook, from the magazine.
- Yes.

43
00:03:02,864 --> 00:03:06,493
Well, I'm assuming
that you're off to a photo shoot

44
00:03:06,826 --> 00:03:09,056
on the beaches of Mexico.

45
00:03:09,329 --> 00:03:11,559
No, I only model part-time these days.

46
00:03:11,831 --> 00:03:14,664
I'm in a PhD programme
at the University ofWashington.

47
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,871
- What's your field?
- Zoology.

48
00:03:17,128 --> 00:03:20,962
That's why I'm going to Mexico,
to observe the spiny-tailed iguana.

49
00:03:21,299 --> 00:03:23,938
A model and a scholar.

50
00:03:25,887 --> 00:03:28,082
This is the part
where I normally wake up.

51
00:03:50,287 --> 00:03:52,084
I know what you're thinking.

52
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:57,658
Last night, walking along the beach,

53
00:03:58,003 --> 00:04:01,120
when we kicked off our shoes
and looked up

54
00:04:01,423 --> 00:04:04,062
at that amazing blanket of stars...

55
00:04:04,342 --> 00:04:07,539
I was remembering when that iguana
ran across your foot,

56
00:04:07,846 --> 00:04:10,235
and you jumped into my arms.

57
00:04:10,515 --> 00:04:12,904
Oh, yes, that, too.

58
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:15,573
You're really quite strong.

59
00:04:15,854 --> 00:04:18,084
I am a supermodel.

60
00:04:19,983 --> 00:04:21,894
So, Frasier...

61
00:04:25,071 --> 00:04:29,144
Is there any chance you'd be interested
in seeing more of me?

62
00:04:29,492 --> 00:04:31,722
There's more?

63
00:04:32,787 --> 00:04:36,462
Of course. Of course.
I was hoping we would.

64
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:39,430
Oh, that's great.

65
00:04:39,711 --> 00:04:43,909
There is one thing I should mention.
It's a little awkward.

66
00:04:44,257 --> 00:04:45,451
What is it?

67
00:04:45,675 --> 00:04:47,791
Well,

68
00:04:48,053 --> 00:04:52,524
I'm in the process
of breaking up with someone.

69
00:04:52,891 --> 00:04:56,281
He plays for the Seahawks,
and with all of us in the public eye,

70
00:04:56,603 --> 00:04:59,197
these things have a way
of getting out. So...

71
00:04:59,481 --> 00:05:03,679
I'd appreciate it if, just for now,
you didn't tell anyone about you and me.

72
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:08,960
What happened between us
will never leave this room.

73
00:05:14,245 --> 00:05:17,078
Ifthere's a God in heaven,
neither will we.

74
00:05:19,876 --> 00:05:21,229
Have you seen Frasier?

75
00:05:21,461 --> 00:05:23,816
- He's not back from the airport yet?
- No.

76
00:05:24,965 --> 00:05:28,275
That's a lot of cheese and crackers.
You gonna eat all those?

77
00:05:28,593 --> 00:05:31,903
Don't be stupid.
I'm havin' people over tonight.

78
00:05:32,222 --> 00:05:34,019
- Morning, all.
- There you are.

79
00:05:34,266 --> 00:05:35,779
I almost gave up on you.

80
00:05:36,017 --> 00:05:38,451
So, Mr lmpulsive,
I got your message.

81
00:05:38,728 --> 00:05:41,925
- How was Mexico?
- Fine. Relaxing.

82
00:05:42,232 --> 00:05:45,224
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Sorry?

83
00:05:45,527 --> 00:05:48,325
Considering what a slump
your sex life has been in,

84
00:05:48,613 --> 00:05:51,685
I know you were hoping for a little,
you know, action.

85
00:05:51,992 --> 00:05:53,744
You know, south ofthe border.

86
00:05:53,994 --> 00:05:57,589
Just because you went to Mexico
and were hit on more than a pinata,

87
00:05:57,914 --> 00:06:00,826
doesn't mean that was the purpose
of my visit as well.

88
00:06:01,126 --> 00:06:04,436
Yeah, right. You wanted
to hear the Acapulco Philharmonic.

89
00:06:05,797 --> 00:06:07,230
So, Doc, you get any?

90
00:06:07,465 --> 00:06:10,935
- That is none ofyour business!.
- Well, better luck next time.

91
00:06:11,261 --> 00:06:15,857
Did it occur to you that I met a woman?
I just don't care to broadcast it.

92
00:06:16,224 --> 00:06:19,057
Sure, that might happen.

93
00:06:19,352 --> 00:06:22,230
Frankly,
I don't have time for this nonsense.

94
00:06:22,522 --> 00:06:24,592
What I did or did not do
is not your concern.

95
00:06:24,858 --> 00:06:27,372
Do you have nothing to do
but enquire about my sex life?

96
00:06:27,652 --> 00:06:30,485
Frasier Crane's sex life.
There's a word for that.

97
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:33,374
It's an oxy, oxy...

98
00:06:33,658 --> 00:06:36,331
- Moron.
- Hey, easy. I'll get it.

99
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:45,006
All right now, flip over.
Ten kicks on each side.

100
00:06:45,295 --> 00:06:48,446
Geez, I hate this one.
What does it do anyway?

101
00:06:48,757 --> 00:06:52,306
Nothing for you.
But it does get a nice breeze going.

102
00:06:54,554 --> 00:06:57,273
- Hello, Dr Crane.
- Daphne.

103
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,034
Hello, Eddie. Good boy, Dad.

104
00:07:05,982 --> 00:07:08,450
- That's it. I'm through.
- Where's Frasier?

105
00:07:08,735 --> 00:07:11,329
He got in a while ago,
but jumped in the shower.

106
00:07:11,613 --> 00:07:14,969
- We don't know why he went to Mexico?
- You heard the message we did.

107
00:07:15,283 --> 00:07:17,922
He wanted to be spontaneous
so he jumped on a plane.

108
00:07:18,203 --> 00:07:19,716
That doesn't concern you?

109
00:07:19,955 --> 00:07:21,946
It's not like him to board a plane

110
00:07:22,207 --> 00:07:25,040
without reservations and luggage,
slumber mask.

111
00:07:26,127 --> 00:07:29,119
He probably went down there
to try to meet some women.

112
00:07:29,422 --> 00:07:31,299
I've seen this with my patients.

113
00:07:31,549 --> 00:07:35,224
They get so distressed over their
failures, especially romantic ones,

114
00:07:35,553 --> 00:07:37,748
that they act out in bizarre ways.

115
00:07:43,603 --> 00:07:46,595
Is there anything more refreshing
after a long flight

116
00:07:46,898 --> 00:07:49,128
than a hot soak in eucalyptus salts

117
00:07:49,401 --> 00:07:52,279
and a snifter ofwarmed Poire William?

118
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,834
Nothing yet, but keep your ears open.

119
00:07:58,827 --> 00:08:02,183
Dr Crane, we're all eager
to hear about your trip.

120
00:08:02,497 --> 00:08:03,930
- Nice time?
- Yes, lovely.

121
00:08:04,165 --> 00:08:06,440
Yeah, did you meet any girls?

122
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:08,940
You know me,
I'm not one to kiss and tell.

123
00:08:09,212 --> 00:08:13,364
Struck out, huh?
Well, it'll all turn around for ya.

124
00:08:13,717 --> 00:08:16,311
You assume it's impossible
for me to meet a woman.

125
00:08:16,594 --> 00:08:19,062
No need to get mad.
I just feel bad for you.

126
00:08:19,347 --> 00:08:21,258
We all do.

127
00:08:21,516 --> 00:08:24,747
You know, frankly,
I'm sick and tired of everyone's pity.

128
00:08:25,061 --> 00:08:27,177
The fact is I did meet
a woman down there.

129
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:30,112
A fabulous woman,
and we had a romantic weekend.

130
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,234
- Why didn't you just tell us that?
- I'm not at liberty to discuss it.

131
00:08:34,571 --> 00:08:37,961
Oh, yes,
that pesky Club Med oath of silence.

132
00:08:44,456 --> 00:08:47,368
No!. She asked me to be discreet.

133
00:08:48,752 --> 00:08:52,665
See, she's a rather
famous supermodel and

134
00:08:54,883 --> 00:08:56,874
she's going through a break-up

135
00:08:57,135 --> 00:08:59,603
with a star football player
on the Seahawks,

136
00:08:59,888 --> 00:09:02,277
and she didn't want any publicity.

137
00:09:02,557 --> 00:09:05,310
So, you see,
before I identify her to you,

138
00:09:05,602 --> 00:09:08,480
I have to ask that you
not ever repeat this to anyone.

139
00:09:08,772 --> 00:09:10,649
I'd urge you to do the same.

140
00:09:14,569 --> 00:09:17,037
Her name is Kelly Easterbrook.

141
00:09:17,322 --> 00:09:20,473
The lotion girl!
She has such milky skin.

142
00:09:20,784 --> 00:09:23,423
I thought so, yes.

143
00:09:23,703 --> 00:09:26,171
We were inseparable the entire weekend.

144
00:09:26,456 --> 00:09:28,287
Some people think I look like her.

145
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:30,896
Oh, yes...

146
00:09:31,169 --> 00:09:35,003
Anyway, I've got a picture of her.
I'll be right back.

147
00:09:36,299 --> 00:09:40,087
It's one thing to concoct
a little white lie, but a supermodel...

148
00:09:40,428 --> 00:09:43,625
Who'd dump an NFL player for Frasier.

149
00:09:44,849 --> 00:09:48,603
You two are just being awful.
I've never known Dr Crane to lie.

150
00:09:48,937 --> 00:09:51,451
Actually, this is not without precedent.

151
00:09:51,731 --> 00:09:55,644
He once forged letters from Leonard
Bernstein and said they were pen pals.

152
00:09:55,986 --> 00:09:57,305
- Oh, yeah.
- Remember?

153
00:09:57,529 --> 00:10:00,885
He'd come bounding up the stairs.
"Got another one from Lenny."

154
00:10:01,199 --> 00:10:04,794
We were all agog until he wrote
that his Broadway debut was Candide

155
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,509
when everyone knows
that it was On the Town.

156
00:10:07,789 --> 00:10:10,428
That's when we knew it was a fake.

157
00:10:10,709 --> 00:10:14,019
The sloppy kid lettering
was also a clue.

158
00:10:16,464 --> 00:10:18,136
Here she is.

159
00:10:20,218 --> 00:10:23,051
- It's from a magazine?
- She's in lots of magazines.

160
00:10:23,346 --> 00:10:26,736
And billboards, too.
Now she's my girlfriend.

161
00:10:28,393 --> 00:10:32,102
Well, I'm off to bed.
Didn't get much sleep over the weekend.

162
00:10:32,439 --> 00:10:36,273
- You know what I mean?
- Oh, yeah. Good night.

163
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:39,488
He just snapped like a twig, didn't he?

164
00:10:45,785 --> 00:10:48,219
Hello? Kelly!

165
00:10:48,496 --> 00:10:51,932
Hi. Gee, I didn't know
you were back in town.

166
00:10:53,543 --> 00:10:57,616
I'd love to. Right. Well, I'll see
you there in, what, half an hour.

167
00:10:57,964 --> 00:11:01,877
OK, yeah, me, too. Bye.

168
00:11:02,218 --> 00:11:06,450
Frasier, glad we caught you. Coming to
the Buster Keaton retrospective?

169
00:11:06,806 --> 00:11:09,878
I'm dashing offto LeScali
for a late lunch with Kelly.

170
00:11:10,185 --> 00:11:11,743
Oh, your supermodel.

171
00:11:11,978 --> 00:11:15,175
- You didn't mention that this morning.
- She just called.

172
00:11:15,482 --> 00:11:18,042
She came home early from Hawaii.

173
00:11:18,318 --> 00:11:21,435
I suspect to see you-know-who.

174
00:11:22,697 --> 00:11:27,248
Bernard? Yes, Dr Crane. I need
my usual table in about twenty minutes.

175
00:11:27,619 --> 00:11:31,851
And chill your finest bottle
of Pouilly-Fuissé.

176
00:11:32,207 --> 00:11:36,962
Well, modelling those swimsuits,
she works up quite a thirst.

177
00:11:38,713 --> 00:11:40,669
Oh, poor sod.

178
00:11:40,924 --> 00:11:43,040
Doesn't he know how outlandish
it sounds?

179
00:11:43,301 --> 00:11:47,214
Even a fake supermodel
would have dumped him by now.

180
00:11:47,555 --> 00:11:50,228
I wish there was something we could do.

181
00:11:50,517 --> 00:11:53,953
There is. When he was in the throes
of his Bernstein obsession,

182
00:11:54,271 --> 00:11:56,421
we confronted him.
As you may recall, Dad,

183
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:59,727
he was relieved
that he could give up the charade.

184
00:12:00,026 --> 00:12:03,860
Well, I guess we could talk to him.
But what're we going to say?

185
00:12:04,197 --> 00:12:05,710
It won't be easy.

186
00:12:05,949 --> 00:12:10,101
We'll tell him we know what's going on
and he doesn't have to pretend anymore.

187
00:12:10,453 --> 00:12:13,525
All right, but situations like that
make me uncomfortable.

188
00:12:13,832 --> 00:12:17,222
There's always the chance
that we'll walk into that restaurant

189
00:12:17,544 --> 00:12:22,254
and some gorgeous supermodel
will be draped all over Frasier.

190
00:12:25,051 --> 00:12:26,564
That's a good one, Dad.

191
00:12:26,803 --> 00:12:28,236
We needed that.

192
00:12:28,471 --> 00:12:31,463
I thought we could do
with a little tension-breaker.

193
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,078
Frasier?

194
00:12:37,314 --> 00:12:39,703
- Hello.
- Hi.

195
00:12:40,817 --> 00:12:43,377
- You look wonderful.
- Thank you.

196
00:12:43,653 --> 00:12:46,531
Here, sit. I ordered us an appetiser.

197
00:12:46,823 --> 00:12:49,781
Oh, this is so sweet, but I can't stay.

198
00:12:50,076 --> 00:12:53,307
- My lab called. Small emergency.
- Is everything all right?

199
00:12:53,622 --> 00:12:57,376
Our incubator broke, and my iguana eggs
need to be moved to another lab.

200
00:12:57,709 --> 00:12:59,825
- I hope you understand.
- Of course.

201
00:13:00,086 --> 00:13:01,838
We'll do it again sometime.

202
00:13:02,088 --> 00:13:04,682
- I'll call you as soon as I'm done.
- Great. OK.

203
00:13:04,966 --> 00:13:09,198
I'll keep my fingers crossed. Here's
hoping your eggs are still fertile.

204
00:13:11,431 --> 00:13:16,221
My wife had trouble conceiving, too.
It turned out to be me.

205
00:13:17,854 --> 00:13:20,926
Well, mystery solved. Offyou go.

206
00:13:28,031 --> 00:13:30,750
Oh, that is so sad.

207
00:13:31,952 --> 00:13:36,104
I'll say. Nobody's ever
bought me caviar, and I'm real.

208
00:13:39,668 --> 00:13:42,023
Maybe this is a family thing.

209
00:13:48,969 --> 00:13:51,563
- Hello, Frasier.
- Hey!

210
00:13:51,972 --> 00:13:55,282
Dad, Niles. Is something the matter?

211
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,991
No, we thought we'd stop by and see if
you'd changed your mind about the movie.

212
00:14:00,355 --> 00:14:03,631
You seem to be awfully persistent,
but I just may join you.

213
00:14:03,942 --> 00:14:05,978
My date cancelled at the last moment.

214
00:14:06,236 --> 00:14:11,390
Frasier. Whatever makes you feel the
need to perpetuate this fantasy woman,

215
00:14:11,783 --> 00:14:14,456
you don't have to on our account.

216
00:14:14,744 --> 00:14:17,212
- Fantasy?
- We're your family.

217
00:14:17,497 --> 00:14:21,536
We don't care if you haven't been out
with anybody in quite a while.

218
00:14:21,876 --> 00:14:26,188
My God! You actually believe
that I've invented this relationship.

219
00:14:26,548 --> 00:14:30,097
It's no crime to go down to Acapulco
and come back empty-handed.

220
00:14:30,427 --> 00:14:35,103
I did not come back empty-handed.
I came back with two huge handfuls.

221
00:14:37,058 --> 00:14:41,097
Kelly was just here.
She was called away on an emergency.

222
00:14:41,438 --> 00:14:43,998
That would be a modelling emergency?

223
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:51,088
No. She only models to raise money
for her real interest/ zoology.

224
00:14:51,489 --> 00:14:54,686
She's a PhD candidate
and she raises iguanas.

225
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,953
The incubator broke,
and her eggs were in danger.

226
00:15:00,248 --> 00:15:03,285
It was vital that only she...
The details are unimportant.

227
00:15:03,585 --> 00:15:06,577
The fact is, I am having
a relationship with this woman.

228
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:13,337
We love you, Frasier.

229
00:15:13,637 --> 00:15:16,515
Niles, me, Daphne...

230
00:15:16,806 --> 00:15:19,718
Leonard Bernstein.

231
00:15:20,018 --> 00:15:23,806
I knew one day
you'd throw that back in my face!

232
00:15:28,443 --> 00:15:30,559
- Kelly!
- Hi!

233
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:33,539
I was leaving you a note.
I'm sorry about lunch.

234
00:15:33,823 --> 00:15:35,495
It's all right. Want to come in?

235
00:15:35,742 --> 00:15:40,418
Sure. Good news is I was able to move
all of my eggs over to another lab.

236
00:15:40,789 --> 00:15:44,384
Well, I hope you didn't put them all
in one basket.

237
00:15:44,709 --> 00:15:46,904
Why does everyone think that's funny?

238
00:15:49,756 --> 00:15:51,667
What a beautiful apartment.

239
00:15:51,925 --> 00:15:55,759
Thank you. Can I interest you
in a glass of Beaujolais Nouveau?

240
00:15:56,096 --> 00:15:57,654
- I'd love some.
- All right.

241
00:15:57,889 --> 00:16:00,483
I actually have something to toast.

242
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:04,157
My doctorate advisor has asked me
to join his researchers

243
00:16:04,479 --> 00:16:06,868
going to the Galápagos lslands.

244
00:16:07,148 --> 00:16:10,504
Well, that does deserve a toast.

245
00:16:10,819 --> 00:16:14,528
I'm replacing someone, so it's
last minute. We leave in the morning.

246
00:16:14,864 --> 00:16:18,174
I'll be there for two months
inseminating indigenous iguanas.

247
00:16:18,493 --> 00:16:21,132
I called all my friends.
They couldn't believe it.

248
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:23,404
Nor will mine.

249
00:16:29,713 --> 00:16:31,465
Two months, huh?

250
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:38,658
Hey, I feel terrible leaving town
so early in our relationship,

251
00:16:39,055 --> 00:16:42,889
but it's an opportunity of a lifetime.

252
00:16:43,226 --> 00:16:44,944
I'll be here when you return,

253
00:16:45,186 --> 00:16:48,383
and we'll have one incredible night
to look back on fondly.

254
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:52,729
I'll thinkwe'll be looking back
on two incredible nights.

255
00:16:53,069 --> 00:16:57,460
No, it's just one night/ Saturday night.
Then, of course, Sunday you were...

256
00:16:59,576 --> 00:17:02,170
Oh, right.

257
00:18:49,102 --> 00:18:51,411
- What was that?
- Nothing, nothing.

258
00:18:51,688 --> 00:18:54,725
I must have drifted off there.

259
00:18:57,068 --> 00:18:58,137
What's that noise?

260
00:18:58,361 --> 00:18:59,680
I don't hear anything.

261
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:05,759
You took a picture of me
while I was asleep?

262
00:19:06,036 --> 00:19:09,073
- Absolutely not!
- Then what is this?

263
00:19:09,372 --> 00:19:13,285
This is... it's your going-away present.
Bon voyage.

264
00:19:13,627 --> 00:19:16,266
- You're disgusting.
- Listen, you don't...

265
00:19:16,546 --> 00:19:18,457
- I don't believe this!
- Listen...

266
00:19:18,715 --> 00:19:21,104
- Get out! Get out!
- Wait.

267
00:19:21,384 --> 00:19:22,703
- All right.
- Get out!

268
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:27,080
You'd think being a model, you might be
more relaxed about somebody taking a...

269
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:29,104
Get out!

270
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:33,912
Can't we talk about this?
I won't see you again for two months.

271
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:36,824
You won't see me again
for a lot longer than that!

272
00:19:37,108 --> 00:19:41,067
It wasn't enough just to say you bagged
a model? You had to take a picture?

273
00:19:41,404 --> 00:19:43,520
- Were you planning to sell it?
- No!

274
00:19:43,782 --> 00:19:46,580
Pass it around the office?
Show it to your friends?

275
00:19:46,868 --> 00:19:50,019
No, just my immediate family.

276
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:53,845
- I'm taking the stairs.
- Kelly! Kelly!

277
00:19:55,251 --> 00:19:57,003
Kelly...

278
00:20:03,051 --> 00:20:05,087
Well, you missed her again.

279
00:20:05,345 --> 00:20:09,133
She's running down the stairs.
You can catch her if you want to.

280
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:11,829
We believe you, Frasier.

281
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:16,178
Now let's just get your robe
all cinched up and get you back inside.

282
00:20:16,523 --> 00:20:18,354
Don't patronise me!

283
00:20:18,608 --> 00:20:21,998
Oh, look, look! Two wine glasses!

284
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:26,711
Oh, yes, one for you, one for her.
That proves it all right.

285
00:20:29,286 --> 00:20:31,675
I am not crazy!

286
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,790
I am dating a supermodel zoologist,

287
00:20:40,797 --> 00:20:43,834
who I stole away
from a professional football player,

288
00:20:44,134 --> 00:20:49,447
and she is off to the Galápagos lslands
to artificially inseminate iguanas.

289
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:54,850
Is that so hard to believe?

290
00:20:55,186 --> 00:20:56,619
Frasier, I want...

291
00:20:56,855 --> 00:20:58,573
Oh, look, a crowd.

292
00:20:58,815 --> 00:21:01,010
Where were you hiding?
Under the bed?

293
00:21:01,276 --> 00:21:05,827
It makes me sick to think I'd even spend
one nightwith you, let alone two!

294
00:21:06,197 --> 00:21:09,985
I've known a lot of reptiles and
looked under a lot of rocks in my life,

295
00:21:10,327 --> 00:21:13,000
but I have never
seen anything slither out

296
00:21:13,288 --> 00:21:16,325
quite as slimy and repulsive as you!

297
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:42,298
Well,

298
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:45,343
what do you think of me now?
