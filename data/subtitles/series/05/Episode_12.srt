1
00:00:10,209 --> 00:00:12,359
-Good morning, Roz.
- Good morning.

2
00:00:17,466 --> 00:00:18,899
Whatwas that?

3
00:00:19,134 --> 00:00:21,170
- Shoot! He's not even here.
- Who?

4
00:00:21,428 --> 00:00:23,942
Remember that guy
who dumped me last month?

5
00:00:24,223 --> 00:00:25,781
I thought he was behind me.

6
00:00:26,016 --> 00:00:29,088
I wanted him to see me with a guy
so he'd know I'm over him.

7
00:00:29,394 --> 00:00:30,383
Good idea.

8
00:00:30,604 --> 00:00:34,802
Ifthat doesn't work we can marry and
have children. That'll fix his wagon.

9
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:36,947
I know you remember him... Stan?

10
00:00:37,194 --> 00:00:42,109
Stan... The smug stockbroker
that kept calling me "Fraser"?

11
00:00:42,491 --> 00:00:44,766
- Oh, God...
- That's him.

12
00:00:45,494 --> 00:00:47,928
We're hot and heavy,
then he stops calling.

13
00:00:48,205 --> 00:00:51,163
It's humiliating to be treated
like you don't exist.

14
00:00:51,458 --> 00:00:54,928
How can he not hearthe difference
between Frasier and Fraser?

15
00:00:55,254 --> 00:01:00,123
That's what bugged me the most, too.
Double espresso to go, please.

16
00:01:00,509 --> 00:01:05,060
I almost forgot. Here's an invitation
to my dad's birthday party.

17
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:09,025
Sherry's giving it, so please excuse
the elegant verse, but...

18
00:01:09,351 --> 00:01:14,266
"Come one, come all, to jump and jive,
Marty Crane's turning 'sexty-five."'

19
00:01:14,648 --> 00:01:17,845
- Oh, my God, here he is. Please...
- Oh, all right.

20
00:01:25,742 --> 00:01:28,461
- Hello.
- Hello, Niles.

21
00:01:28,745 --> 00:01:32,863
This isn't what it looks like.
Her ex-boyfriend was... Stop that!

22
00:01:33,208 --> 00:01:35,199
Please, no explanation necessary.

23
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:38,258
At the next meeting of the
"Haven't Kissed Roz" Club,

24
00:01:38,547 --> 00:01:40,378
it'll just be me
and the Archbishop.

25
00:01:40,632 --> 00:01:42,623
I'll save you the club dues.

26
00:01:46,471 --> 00:01:49,463
Everyone kisses better than Maris!

27
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,277
One of the same for Dr Crane, please.
Thanks.

28
00:01:57,566 --> 00:02:00,444
Sorry I'm late.
I was shopping for Dad's present.

29
00:02:00,736 --> 00:02:03,011
I did a bit ofthat myselfthis morning.

30
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,432
Found a lovely little calfskin wallet
with a matching key case.

31
00:02:07,784 --> 00:02:09,502
Well, bravo, Frasier.

32
00:02:09,745 --> 00:02:13,055
Itwas a full $20 below
our agreed-upon spending limit.

33
00:02:13,373 --> 00:02:16,649
- I'm glad we agreed to rein ourselves.
- God, me too.

34
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:21,238
Do away with our annual contest to see
who could get Dad the most lavish gift.

35
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:24,980
The competition had gotten...
What is the best word for it?

36
00:02:25,302 --> 00:02:27,577
- Extreme.
- No, childish.

37
00:02:27,846 --> 00:02:28,835
- Gaudy.
- Crass.

38
00:02:29,056 --> 00:02:30,250
- Obscene.
- Baroque.

39
00:02:30,474 --> 00:02:31,702
Stop it!

40
00:02:33,268 --> 00:02:35,065
So, what did you get him?

41
00:02:35,312 --> 00:02:38,702
Oh, just some beer.

42
00:02:40,525 --> 00:02:43,517
We're not bumping our heads
on that spending ceiling.

43
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:46,778
It's a bit fancier.
It's a membership in a beer club.

44
00:02:47,074 --> 00:02:49,872
They deliver a case
from a micro-brewery monthly.

45
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,835
You know, I looked into those clubs.
They were rather expensive.

46
00:02:54,164 --> 00:02:55,995
Not really. I'm at our limit.

47
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,445
Maybe with taxes,
I'm a drop or two over.

48
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:01,782
- How big a drop?
- Just $100 over.

49
00:03:02,089 --> 00:03:04,364
- That's a downpour!
- It's a dribble.

50
00:03:04,633 --> 00:03:06,908
That's a deluge, and stop it!

51
00:03:07,177 --> 00:03:10,647
Why not stick $100 in that wallet
ofyours and we're even?

52
00:03:10,973 --> 00:03:13,965
Frankly, I don't need to buy Dad's love.

53
00:03:14,268 --> 00:03:16,987
You saw fit to violate our agreement,
so be it.

54
00:03:17,271 --> 00:03:19,739
- I have a gift. You have a gift.
- Fine.

55
00:03:20,023 --> 00:03:21,456
Big baby.

56
00:03:32,119 --> 00:03:36,351
Stare all you like.
You'll not distract me from my paper.

57
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:41,917
You see? Your efforts are futile.
I can't even see you.

58
00:03:56,768 --> 00:04:00,681
It's so unhealthy. Isn't she serving
anything at Dad's party but meat?

59
00:04:01,023 --> 00:04:03,901
Sherry says that's what he
and his old cronies like.

60
00:04:04,192 --> 00:04:06,706
With drinks,
she's serving cocktail franks.

61
00:04:06,987 --> 00:04:09,626
For appetisers,
we're having a sausage medley,

62
00:04:09,907 --> 00:04:13,866
and for the main course, there's
a choice of meatloaf or meatballs.

63
00:04:15,162 --> 00:04:18,916
I assume these balloons
are for the between-course angioplasty.

64
00:04:20,167 --> 00:04:22,761
- Did you get everything, darlin'?
- I think so.

65
00:04:23,045 --> 00:04:27,084
Good news! I found a guy
who can sculpt an exact replica

66
00:04:27,424 --> 00:04:31,258
of Marty's old police badge
out of six pounds of liverwurst.

67
00:04:31,595 --> 00:04:36,066
Reminiscent ofthe cream cheese gavel
they gave Thurgood Marshall on his 80th.

68
00:04:36,433 --> 00:04:39,584
We can't use this photograph.
It's too embarrassing.

69
00:04:39,895 --> 00:04:41,487
That's why we're using it.

70
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:44,961
I'm decorating the party
with pictures of Marty from the force.

71
00:04:45,275 --> 00:04:48,392
We can't use this one of me
at the morgue. It's too disturbing.

72
00:04:48,695 --> 00:04:51,255
You're right.
I'd forgotten you even had a perm.

73
00:04:51,532 --> 00:04:53,523
Dear Lord.

74
00:04:53,784 --> 00:04:56,662
I can't wait to see
this guy again. Mickey Dugan.

75
00:04:56,954 --> 00:05:00,549
- We rode Mounted Patrol together.
- Look at you!

76
00:05:00,874 --> 00:05:04,025
You look so big and handsome
on your horse!

77
00:05:04,336 --> 00:05:07,328
- Oh, my God! When was this taken?
- April Fool's Day.

78
00:05:07,631 --> 00:05:10,703
That explains why your horses
are wearing brassieres.

79
00:05:11,009 --> 00:05:15,241
God, I loved that horse. Old Agides
and I were together for eight years.

80
00:05:15,597 --> 00:05:18,475
- Best partner I ever had.
- We should get going.

81
00:05:18,767 --> 00:05:21,520
Wherever did you find a bra
that could fit a horse?

82
00:05:21,812 --> 00:05:23,609
Mickey brought it in from home.

83
00:05:23,855 --> 00:05:27,006
Mae Dugan was a lot ofthings,
but petite she wasn't.

84
00:05:27,317 --> 00:05:29,194
I'll point her out at the party.

85
00:05:29,444 --> 00:05:33,039
Honey, ifthat's her bra,
I can spot her myself.

86
00:05:34,825 --> 00:05:39,023
- Sherry, Niles?
- No, thanks. I've got a session.

87
00:05:40,414 --> 00:05:43,167
- Dr Crane, is your father gone?
- Yes, he has.

88
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:46,450
Good, I'll wrap his present.
They fit fine in this box.

89
00:05:46,753 --> 00:05:48,744
- Great. Off you go.
- Wait a minute.

90
00:05:49,006 --> 00:05:51,998
- That box is big for what you got him.
- No, it isn't.

91
00:05:52,301 --> 00:05:55,099
Your binoculars
fit just perfectly in here.

92
00:05:56,346 --> 00:05:58,814
You told me you got him
a wallet and a key case.

93
00:05:59,099 --> 00:06:02,694
Oh, no, not this again.
It's the same nonsense every year.

94
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:06,854
We'd agreed to a spending limit
until someone else exceeded it.

95
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:09,021
All right, guilty as charged.

96
00:06:09,276 --> 00:06:13,554
We've each violated the pact once.
Let's stop before this gets out of hand.

97
00:06:13,906 --> 00:06:17,785
Ifyou ask me, your gifts
complement one another perfectly.

98
00:06:18,118 --> 00:06:21,030
Your binoculars
and your football tickets.

99
00:06:23,498 --> 00:06:27,457
- Tickets?
- Season tickets to the Seahawks.

100
00:06:27,794 --> 00:06:30,945
I don't believe you!
You already had a better gift than mine.

101
00:06:31,256 --> 00:06:33,645
You still needed
to take it to a higher level!

102
00:06:33,926 --> 00:06:36,679
I knew you'd upgrade that wallet,
which you did.

103
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:39,564
Enough is enough.
I'm throwing in the towel.

104
00:06:39,848 --> 00:06:41,247
Why should I believe you?

105
00:06:41,475 --> 00:06:44,547
This is a receipt forthe binoculars.
This should prove

106
00:06:44,853 --> 00:06:49,244
that I have no intention of returning
them in orderto get a better gift.

107
00:06:50,609 --> 00:06:53,521
Well, that's very big ofyou.

108
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:56,414
I'm late for my session.

109
00:06:56,698 --> 00:07:00,486
If it's any consolation, I'm not sure
how good those tickets are.

110
00:07:00,827 --> 00:07:02,818
I'd hoped for the first few
yard lines,

111
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,833
but could only get ones
way back on the fiftieth.

112
00:07:09,336 --> 00:07:11,804
I'm very proud ofyou, Dr Crane...

113
00:07:12,089 --> 00:07:14,080
Stop babbling. Bring me some tape.

114
00:07:18,053 --> 00:07:21,363
OK, the keg of beer
will be there by six.

115
00:07:21,682 --> 00:07:24,480
I also confirmed the band,
ordered the cake,

116
00:07:24,768 --> 00:07:28,681
filled out the place cards,
picked up the humorous cocktail napkins,

117
00:07:29,022 --> 00:07:31,741
and I'm almost done
making the centrepieces.

118
00:07:32,025 --> 00:07:34,414
This party is just gonna wear me out.

119
00:07:36,196 --> 00:07:38,232
- Hello, Daphne, Sherry.
- Niles!

120
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:41,960
Double latte, please.
Thank you. Is Frasier with you?

121
00:07:42,286 --> 00:07:45,164
- No, he's out shopping for your dad.
- That jackal!

122
00:07:48,709 --> 00:07:52,543
- What was that all about?
- Brother snit. Don't ask.

123
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,279
I forgot to tell you,

124
00:07:54,506 --> 00:07:58,545
I found this fabulous photograph
of Marty arresting some guy.

125
00:07:58,886 --> 00:08:00,956
I had it blown up to life-size,

126
00:08:01,221 --> 00:08:03,781
then cut out the face
so people could look through

127
00:08:04,057 --> 00:08:06,890
and have a snapshot
of Marty reading them their rights.

128
00:08:07,185 --> 00:08:08,504
Don't you just love it?

129
00:08:08,729 --> 00:08:13,439
- It depends. Do I have to pick it up?
- By five. You're a doll.

130
00:08:13,817 --> 00:08:16,285
- Hello, mesdemoiselles.
- Oh, Frasier!

131
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:18,800
- Did you find something?
- Yes, I did.

132
00:08:19,072 --> 00:08:23,065
It took most of the afternoon, but
I found something I think is perfect.

133
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:25,162
Niles forgot his coffee.

134
00:08:25,412 --> 00:08:27,084
- Niles was here?
- Yes.

135
00:08:27,331 --> 00:08:31,006
When I mentioned you were shopping,
he shot out of here.

136
00:08:31,335 --> 00:08:33,326
That little worm!

137
00:08:44,139 --> 00:08:47,893
- Dr Crane, are you all right?
- No, I am not.

138
00:08:49,645 --> 00:08:53,399
I've combed the entire city
trying to find a gift.

139
00:08:53,732 --> 00:08:56,087
Nothing is better
than what Niles got him.

140
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,193
- What did your brother get him?
- I don't know.

141
00:09:02,366 --> 00:09:05,244
I'm sure it's something
any father would just love.

142
00:09:05,536 --> 00:09:09,131
The best thing about turning 65 is,
everybodywants to buy you dinner.

143
00:09:09,456 --> 00:09:12,050
Mr Crane, your top button is unbuttoned.

144
00:09:12,334 --> 00:09:14,894
Duke's taking me
to Hoppe's Old Heidelberg.

145
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:19,846
You know, if I don't unbutton it now,
it might fly off and hurt somebody.

146
00:09:20,217 --> 00:09:22,048
- Enjoy, Dad.
- Yeah, I will.

147
00:09:22,302 --> 00:09:24,691
I gotta tell ya,
I'm lovin' this birthday.

148
00:09:24,972 --> 00:09:26,690
Suddenly, my money's no good.

149
00:09:26,932 --> 00:09:30,129
Last night Ed Flanagan bought
the bar a round in my honour.

150
00:09:30,435 --> 00:09:32,949
- Who's Ed Flanagan?
- That's what I asked.

151
00:09:34,523 --> 00:09:37,674
- What're you doing tonight, Fras?
- Nothing much.

152
00:09:37,985 --> 00:09:42,342
- Got some shopping to do.
- For anybody we know?

153
00:09:43,907 --> 00:09:46,182
You know, Frasier,
every year you and Niles,

154
00:09:46,451 --> 00:09:50,160
you go overboard trying to find
these great presents for me,

155
00:09:50,497 --> 00:09:55,048
and, you know, I gotta be honest,
it's always made me uncomfortable.

156
00:09:55,419 --> 00:09:56,852
- Really?
- Yeah.

157
00:09:57,087 --> 00:09:59,840
So this year, I just wanted you to know,

158
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:02,521
I'm over it. So go crazy!

159
00:10:02,801 --> 00:10:05,031
You only turn 65 once!

160
00:10:20,277 --> 00:10:21,790
You know, Dr Crane,

161
00:10:22,029 --> 00:10:26,545
the last thing I want to do is encourage
more competition between you and Niles.

162
00:10:26,909 --> 00:10:30,140
But ifyou really want to make
your father happy, maybe...

163
00:10:30,454 --> 00:10:33,491
- No, don't even say it!
- It's all he's ever asked for!

164
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:38,102
No, God, it'll ruin my apartment!
My life! I can't! I won't! I mustn't!

165
00:10:40,714 --> 00:10:43,353
It's over, Dr Crane.

166
00:10:51,725 --> 00:10:55,604
That is one big-screen TV!

167
00:10:55,938 --> 00:11:00,136
- He's gonna love it.
- I know.

168
00:11:05,405 --> 00:11:09,000
Perhaps I'm panicking needlessly.
It just needs dressing up.

169
00:11:09,326 --> 00:11:12,523
Here, I'll just arrange these plants
here at the base.

170
00:11:12,829 --> 00:11:15,548
You always said you needed
more greenery in here.

171
00:11:15,832 --> 00:11:18,471
And maybe an objet or two on top.

172
00:11:18,752 --> 00:11:21,949
Yes, this, this little bud vase.
Here.

173
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:26,453
That makes a difference, doesn't it?

174
00:11:26,718 --> 00:11:30,154
Sure it does, Dr Crane.
All the difference in the world.

175
00:11:30,472 --> 00:11:33,384
It's ghastly.

176
00:11:33,684 --> 00:11:37,393
You don't just put a smear of lipstick
on the Bride of Frankenstein

177
00:11:37,729 --> 00:11:40,562
and turn her into a trophy wife,
do you?

178
00:11:40,857 --> 00:11:42,336
- Niles!
- Are you ready?

179
00:11:42,568 --> 00:11:45,082
We told Dad we'd pick him up at...

180
00:11:59,751 --> 00:12:02,948
- Oh, my God, you didn't!
- Didn't what?

181
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:04,927
Buy Dad this television set?

182
00:12:05,173 --> 00:12:08,722
Of course I did!
It's impressive, isn't it?

183
00:12:09,553 --> 00:12:13,751
I knew how jealous you were, but to go
to such insane lengths to top me,

184
00:12:14,099 --> 00:12:17,296
you have lain waste
to your apartment with this eyesore.

185
00:12:17,603 --> 00:12:18,592
I disagree.

186
00:12:18,812 --> 00:12:22,566
You see an eyesore, I see a window
into a world of art and culture.

187
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:27,018
Think how this screen will enhance
the majesty ofthe Metropolitan Opera.

188
00:12:27,362 --> 00:12:30,195
Orthe thrilling artists ofthe Bolshoi.

189
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:33,323
You're quite
a "Bolshoi" artistyourself.

190
00:12:36,121 --> 00:12:38,589
You're right. It's dreadful, isn't it?

191
00:12:38,874 --> 00:12:42,184
But it's worth it to imagine
the smile it'll put on Dad's face,

192
00:12:42,502 --> 00:12:45,858
not the mention the pleasure
ofwatching you writhe in envy.

193
00:12:48,258 --> 00:12:51,694
- You're not writhing.
- I'm sorry, my mind wandered.

194
00:12:52,012 --> 00:12:56,369
I was remembering Dad waxing nostalgic
about his beloved old horse Agides.

195
00:12:56,725 --> 00:12:59,364
Don't try to change the subject.
You've lost.

196
00:12:59,645 --> 00:13:01,044
He did love that horse.

197
00:13:01,271 --> 00:13:04,547
You can only live in denial
for so long before you...

198
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:10,690
You didn't?

199
00:13:10,906 --> 00:13:14,819
Didn't what?
Buy the horse? Sorry. Did.

200
00:13:17,037 --> 00:13:18,026
How could you?

201
00:13:18,247 --> 00:13:21,683
I've set him up in a stable.
Dad can visit him any time he wants.

202
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,436
I'd like to swing bythe stable
on the way to the party

203
00:13:25,754 --> 00:13:28,222
so Dad can look his gift horse
in the mouth.

204
00:13:32,302 --> 00:13:34,691
All right, Niles.

205
00:13:34,972 --> 00:13:36,849
What else can I do?

206
00:13:37,099 --> 00:13:40,614
I give up. You win.

207
00:13:40,936 --> 00:13:43,655
You have found the one gift
that can't be trumped.

208
00:13:43,939 --> 00:13:47,136
Thank you, Frasier.
You're a gracious loser.

209
00:13:47,442 --> 00:13:49,637
Still, on the bright side,

210
00:13:49,903 --> 00:13:52,975
I know Dad will love this set.
He really will.

211
00:13:53,282 --> 00:13:56,638
It doesn't seem quite as intrusive
as it did when it got here.

212
00:13:56,952 --> 00:13:59,227
Right this way.

213
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:03,269
- What are those?
- Your speakers.

214
00:14:12,217 --> 00:14:15,129
Dad, any idea where you are?

215
00:14:15,429 --> 00:14:18,466
It's so mysterious. Hay underfoot.

216
00:14:18,765 --> 00:14:22,280
Stable smells.
That saddle we just tripped over.

217
00:14:22,603 --> 00:14:26,721
- I mean, we could be anywhere.
- All right, all right. Hold on.

218
00:14:31,111 --> 00:14:33,784
Voilà! Happy birthday.

219
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,890
Agides!

220
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:41,550
Hey, buddy! How ya doin'?

221
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:44,986
Oh, long time no see.

222
00:14:45,292 --> 00:14:48,648
- What's goin' on?
- He's yours, Dad.

223
00:14:48,962 --> 00:14:52,113
- What?
- I bought him for you.

224
00:14:54,009 --> 00:14:56,159
You're kiddin' me.
I can't believe it.

225
00:14:56,428 --> 00:15:00,706
- You can visit him any time you want.
- What? This is amazing.

226
00:15:01,058 --> 00:15:06,052
How've you been, buddy?
Hey, one plus one equals...?

227
00:15:07,856 --> 00:15:09,733
He remembers!

228
00:15:10,651 --> 00:15:14,769
I figured it was a long shot. They were
about to put him out to pasture.

229
00:15:15,113 --> 00:15:17,946
I set him up here,
the most exclusive stable in town.

230
00:15:18,242 --> 00:15:21,393
Don't be surprised ifyou spy
a certain resident trotting by

231
00:15:21,703 --> 00:15:23,182
wearing his triple crown.

232
00:15:23,413 --> 00:15:27,850
They don't give them actual crowns,
you twit!

233
00:15:30,087 --> 00:15:32,726
Come on,
we don't want to be late for the party.

234
00:15:33,006 --> 00:15:35,804
I'm sure Sherry's
gettin' warm in that cake.

235
00:15:37,636 --> 00:15:39,513
Dad?

236
00:15:40,097 --> 00:15:41,769
Don't want to be late.

237
00:15:42,015 --> 00:15:45,485
- You all right, Dad?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

238
00:15:45,811 --> 00:15:49,360
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I said I was fine. I'm fine.

239
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:52,887
Come on, let's go to my party.

240
00:15:53,193 --> 00:15:55,753
Is there something
you'd like to talk about?

241
00:15:56,029 --> 00:16:01,581
You don't have to pull everything apart.
I said I'm fine, all right? Let's go.

242
00:16:04,413 --> 00:16:09,726
All that effort, all that expense...
How many minutes of joy did it buy?

243
00:16:31,773 --> 00:16:33,764
Oh, dear God,

244
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:36,301
it's Stonehenge.

245
00:16:40,657 --> 00:16:43,854
I hope it'll cheer Dad up.
The party certainly didn't.

246
00:16:44,161 --> 00:16:48,120
God, I know. Not even when Sherry
sang that little ditty she composed.

247
00:16:48,457 --> 00:16:51,688
"You can cop a feel
if I can feel a cop".

248
00:16:53,837 --> 00:16:56,635
- Brandy, Niles?
- Please.

249
00:16:56,924 --> 00:16:59,722
I tried to draw Dad out at the party.
He shot me down.

250
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:01,568
You know how he is.

251
00:17:01,803 --> 00:17:04,681
He gets himself into these moods.
He just retreats.

252
00:17:04,973 --> 00:17:06,850
It's just so damned frustrating.

253
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:11,139
I wonder if that's why we go so insane
trying to find the perfect gift,

254
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,597
as if finding the right present
will change everything.

255
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,698
- That occurred to me, too.
- You didn't mention it.

256
00:17:17,986 --> 00:17:19,817
- It occurred to me.
- So you say.

257
00:17:20,072 --> 00:17:21,903
Stop it!

258
00:17:22,157 --> 00:17:24,955
Hiya, boys!

259
00:17:27,454 --> 00:17:29,843
She's a beaut!

260
00:17:30,123 --> 00:17:33,832
Marty and I are going to be spending
a lot more time over here.

261
00:17:34,169 --> 00:17:36,967
It's a gift that keeps on giving.

262
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:41,693
- So where's your dad?
- He said he was coming with you.

263
00:17:42,052 --> 00:17:44,202
He told me he was coming home with you.

264
00:17:44,471 --> 00:17:45,870
Why would he do that?

265
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:50,216
He was a little down at the party.
Maybe he just wanted to go for a walk.

266
00:17:50,561 --> 00:17:53,359
I'm sure he's all right.
He'll be back soon.

267
00:17:53,647 --> 00:17:57,356
Still, it is rather late.
I think I'll just go and look for him.

268
00:17:57,693 --> 00:17:59,809
I thinkyou're fretting needlessly.

269
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:03,187
Let's fire this baby up.
You like the Nashville Network?

270
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:06,243
Who am I kidding? I'm worried sick!

271
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:13,079
Here ya go.

272
00:18:14,334 --> 00:18:17,132
Hey, no offence,
butyourteeth look like hell.

273
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:22,006
I gotta tell ya, the rest ofyou
is not lookin' much better either.

274
00:18:22,342 --> 00:18:24,810
Here, let me give ya
a little rubdown, huh?

275
00:18:26,471 --> 00:18:29,065
That takes me back.

276
00:18:29,349 --> 00:18:32,864
Of course, your coat
was a lot shinier in those days.

277
00:18:33,186 --> 00:18:35,381
Hell, so was mine.

278
00:18:37,566 --> 00:18:40,126
We were somethin', weren't we, Agides?

279
00:18:40,402 --> 00:18:42,393
Riding crowd control.

280
00:18:43,822 --> 00:18:46,734
People just step aside to let us pass.

281
00:18:47,034 --> 00:18:52,028
Now they're puttin' you out to pasture,
and I'm ridin' the buses.

282
00:18:53,916 --> 00:18:56,635
Yeah, it's fun gettin' old, isn't it?

283
00:18:56,919 --> 00:18:59,592
Hey, but this is a nice place here,
you know.

284
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,155
I bet you're really gonna like it here.

285
00:19:05,969 --> 00:19:09,325
Ifyou don't like it here,
then we'll do what we said we would.

286
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,313
We'll just go to Montana, start a ranch.

287
00:19:12,601 --> 00:19:17,038
We've still got that money from those
drug dealers buried in the box canyon.

288
00:19:17,397 --> 00:19:19,831
All right, Dad,
we know you know we're here.

289
00:19:20,108 --> 00:19:22,861
Then why don't you get
the hell outta here?

290
00:19:23,153 --> 00:19:26,145
I just want to be alone for a minute.
Is that all right?

291
00:19:27,449 --> 00:19:30,043
- Fine. We'll see you later.
- Thank you.

292
00:19:30,327 --> 00:19:32,921
It's troubling
that you feel more comfortable

293
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:35,400
talking to your horse than to your sons.

294
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:38,419
We might be able to help you.
The ageing process...

295
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:41,622
No, now stop it.
You see, this is the problem.

296
00:19:41,922 --> 00:19:44,152
I know everything you're gonna say.

297
00:19:44,424 --> 00:19:48,258
You start talkin' about 65
as being some sort of passage.

298
00:19:48,595 --> 00:19:52,873
Then you'll start spoutin' theories
and who knows what else.

299
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:56,854
By the time you get through
analysing me, I'm gonna be 66.

300
00:19:57,187 --> 00:20:00,896
Look, when I tell Agides somethin',
you know what he does?

301
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:03,906
Nothin'. He just listens to me.

302
00:20:04,194 --> 00:20:07,743
- We listen.
- That's my slogan. "I'm listening."

303
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:11,782
- You know, Dad, for God's sake...
- They pay a great deal of money...

304
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:13,234
Hey!

305
00:20:13,453 --> 00:20:15,409
Right.

306
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:20,601
Look, when I saw Agides today,
it was kind of a shock

307
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:23,911
to see how old he's gotten,
and I just...

308
00:20:24,214 --> 00:20:27,809
- I realised how old I've gotten.
- You still have a lot of years...

309
00:20:28,135 --> 00:20:29,329
- No, please.
- Sorry.

310
00:20:29,553 --> 00:20:33,148
It's not a problem you can solve,
it's just a fact of life.

311
00:20:34,391 --> 00:20:36,541
People get old.

312
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:40,246
I guess this horse wasn't
the banner gift I thought it would be.

313
00:20:40,564 --> 00:20:43,032
Oh, yes, it was, Niles.

314
00:20:44,902 --> 00:20:49,453
I'm feelin' a bit sorry for myself now,
but I'll get over that.

315
00:20:49,823 --> 00:20:53,941
But I love this horse.
It's the greatest present I've ever got.

316
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:56,622
Well, I'm glad, Dad.

317
00:20:56,872 --> 00:20:59,625
But, you know,
I think I may have misled you.

318
00:20:59,917 --> 00:21:02,556
The horse is from me and from Frasier.

319
00:21:02,836 --> 00:21:05,987
Oh, geez, I'm sorry. Thanks a lot, Fras.

320
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:09,529
Well, actually,
it was mostly Niles' idea.

321
00:21:09,843 --> 00:21:13,677
Well, then, thanks to both ofya.
It's just great.

322
00:21:14,723 --> 00:21:17,556
Well, we oughta get goin', huh?
Let's get a move on.

323
00:21:17,851 --> 00:21:20,411
Hey, see you, buddy!

324
00:21:20,687 --> 00:21:24,600
Niles, what a generous gesture.

325
00:21:24,942 --> 00:21:26,739
How can I ever thank you?

326
00:21:26,985 --> 00:21:31,456
By calling your super and getting rid
ofthat monstrosity in your apartment.

327
00:21:31,823 --> 00:21:34,018
I do visit from time to time, you know.
