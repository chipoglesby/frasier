1
00:00:14,087 --> 00:00:17,045
Trickortreat.
Or should I say pip pip?

2
00:00:17,341 --> 00:00:21,095
- What's with the outfit?
- This is part ofyour costume.

3
00:00:21,428 --> 00:00:24,659
You said you were getting me
a Sherlock Holmes outfit.

4
00:00:24,973 --> 00:00:28,761
They were out of Sherlock Holmes.
Don't worry, it's another detective.

5
00:00:29,102 --> 00:00:32,299
You'll be Lord Peter Wimsey.

6
00:00:32,606 --> 00:00:33,721
Who's that?

7
00:00:33,941 --> 00:00:37,695
He's a sleuth from a series of novels
by Dorothy L Sayers.

8
00:00:38,028 --> 00:00:41,907
I'm not going anywhere where
I have to tell people my name's Wimsey.

9
00:00:42,241 --> 00:00:44,801
I'm just going to wear
my old police uniform.

10
00:00:45,077 --> 00:00:48,353
It's a Halloween ball
for the Library Association.

11
00:00:48,664 --> 00:00:51,098
You have to go
as a character from literature.

12
00:00:51,375 --> 00:00:55,004
Why didn't I go with Sherry
to visit her mother in prison?

13
00:00:57,130 --> 00:01:00,327
It'll be fun.
I'm going as Cyrano de Bergerac.

14
00:01:00,634 --> 00:01:02,590
Musician. Philosopher. Fighter.

15
00:01:02,844 --> 00:01:05,722
The greatest friend
and the bravest swordsman alive.

16
00:01:06,014 --> 00:01:08,164
What's all over your cane?

17
00:01:08,433 --> 00:01:11,186
I dropped it
in the movie theatre last night.

18
00:01:12,688 --> 00:01:15,327
I love this picture.
You look adorable in that.

19
00:01:15,607 --> 00:01:18,599
I do not. You like it
because you look so handsome in it.

20
00:01:18,902 --> 00:01:20,654
The camera doesn't lie.

21
00:01:20,904 --> 00:01:22,496
What are you giggling about?

22
00:01:22,739 --> 00:01:25,572
Snapshots from ourtrip
to the microbrewery.

23
00:01:25,868 --> 00:01:27,859
That must have been fun for you, Dad.

24
00:01:29,329 --> 00:01:31,559
- You're not in any of these.
- I didn't go.

25
00:01:31,832 --> 00:01:33,709
Eddie got into the poison oak.

26
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:37,076
I was up all night rubbing
calamine lotion on his belly.

27
00:01:37,379 --> 00:01:40,974
These really are the golden years
foryou, aren't they?

28
00:01:42,384 --> 00:01:44,375
So itwas justyou and Frasier?

29
00:01:44,636 --> 00:01:47,355
We got pretty silly
aftertasting all that beer.

30
00:01:47,639 --> 00:01:50,551
There's no need to tell Niles
everything we did.

31
00:01:50,851 --> 00:01:52,842
Yes, we got a bit naughty.

32
00:01:55,772 --> 00:01:57,763
Not too naughty, I hope.

33
00:01:58,025 --> 00:02:00,220
Dr Crane,
I know what you're thinking.

34
00:02:00,485 --> 00:02:04,797
After all that drinking, we didn't drive
home. We spent the night in a motel.

35
00:02:07,284 --> 00:02:10,276
That takes a load off my mind.

36
00:02:10,579 --> 00:02:14,015
Niles, what time is this
little soiree ofyours this evening?

37
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:17,689
I've still got to get the velvet
in my slippers recrushed.

38
00:02:18,003 --> 00:02:20,915
Dad, I will find you
a Sherlock Holmes outfit.

39
00:02:21,215 --> 00:02:24,730
7.00pm. I have to get home
before Marta arrives to set up.

40
00:02:25,052 --> 00:02:26,610
She's arachnophobic.

41
00:02:26,845 --> 00:02:30,838
Last Halloween she beat my centrepiece
to bits with a broom.

42
00:02:31,183 --> 00:02:34,653
Perhaps we should go finish up
those costumes, wife.

43
00:02:34,978 --> 00:02:38,254
- Did you say "wife"?
- Hasn't your brother told you?

44
00:02:38,565 --> 00:02:41,921
He's going as Geoffrey Chaucer
from The Canterbury Tales.

45
00:02:42,236 --> 00:02:47,264
- I'll be dressed as the Wife of Bath.
- And a saucy strumpet she is, too.

46
00:02:47,658 --> 00:02:49,535
You naughty rogue.

47
00:02:49,785 --> 00:02:52,458
We've been having quite a time
talking like that.

48
00:02:52,746 --> 00:02:55,783
It's been ye olde laugh riot
around here.

49
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:01,669
- Join me in my bed chamber, my lord?
- After you, my juicy wench.

50
00:03:02,005 --> 00:03:05,315
"My juicy wench"? No, not you, Maris.

51
00:03:07,052 --> 00:03:10,203
Wait. I hope you're happy.
She's run for her water pills.

52
00:03:14,059 --> 00:03:16,050
Roz, who's on the line?

53
00:03:16,311 --> 00:03:20,623
We have Ted
who is feeling a little disconnected.

54
00:03:21,483 --> 00:03:23,474
Go ahead, Ted.

55
00:03:34,997 --> 00:03:37,716
I hope Ted appreciates irony.

56
00:03:38,917 --> 00:03:43,672
On line two we have Bill. He's going
through a very difficult transition.

57
00:03:44,214 --> 00:03:47,411
- Hello, Bill.
- Hello? Is someone there?

58
00:03:49,887 --> 00:03:53,482
I see we're pretty much through
our transition, aren't we, Bill?

59
00:03:54,433 --> 00:03:56,742
- This is Dorothy.
- Bill's on line one.

60
00:03:57,019 --> 00:03:59,294
Let's just stay with Dorothy.

61
00:03:59,563 --> 00:04:01,713
- How can I help you?
- You can get me Roz.

62
00:04:01,982 --> 00:04:05,258
I'm hermanicurist.
She called for an appointment.

63
00:04:06,236 --> 00:04:08,909
I'll call you back later, Dorothy.

64
00:04:09,656 --> 00:04:11,647
We'll take a moment to regroup.

65
00:04:11,909 --> 00:04:15,788
I apologise for the unusually
high number of technical difficulties

66
00:04:16,121 --> 00:04:20,433
we've experienced today. And now we will
go to these public service messages.

67
00:04:24,796 --> 00:04:27,833
- Explain yourself.
- I'm a little off my game today.

68
00:04:28,133 --> 00:04:30,124
- A little?
- OK, a lot.

69
00:04:30,385 --> 00:04:33,183
You come in looking ghoulish,
even for Halloween,

70
00:04:33,472 --> 00:04:35,781
and you sleepwalk through my show.

71
00:04:37,601 --> 00:04:41,389
- I'm sorry.
- What kind of explanation can there be

72
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:44,608
for this level of unprofessionalism?

73
00:04:46,902 --> 00:04:48,893
I think I'm pregnant.

74
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:53,939
Pregnant?

75
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:58,949
I took a home test and it was iffy,
so I went to see my doctor.

76
00:04:59,331 --> 00:05:01,322
He'll call me with results later.

77
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:04,302
- But, Roz, how?
- I don't know how.

78
00:05:04,586 --> 00:05:08,135
No one is more careful than I am
when it comes to birth control.

79
00:05:08,465 --> 00:05:12,936
But even the best protection
is only effective 99 out of 100 times.

80
00:05:13,303 --> 00:05:15,737
I can't beat those odds.

81
00:05:22,771 --> 00:05:26,161
I suppose you've been dodging
that bullet for a long time now.

82
00:05:26,567 --> 00:05:28,842
Promise you won't tell anyone.

83
00:05:29,111 --> 00:05:33,070
Of course not, Roz, but we don't even
know ifwe have anything to tell yet.

84
00:05:33,407 --> 00:05:36,444
- What if there is?
- We'll deal with that when we have to.

85
00:05:36,743 --> 00:05:39,303
No use crossing that bridge
until we come to it.

86
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,571
I can't get my mind off it.

87
00:05:41,832 --> 00:05:44,107
Niles' party will be a distraction.

88
00:05:44,376 --> 00:05:47,334
- I don't think I'm up for that.
- Come on, Roz.

89
00:05:47,629 --> 00:05:51,542
- Well, I did rent a costume.
- lt'll be fun. You know you want to.

90
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:54,682
That's exactly the kind of talk
that got me into this.

91
00:05:56,138 --> 00:06:01,258
Tell your brother I'm coming to his
party. I found the perfect costume.

92
00:06:01,643 --> 00:06:04,032
What literary character will you be?

93
00:06:04,313 --> 00:06:06,031
Waldo.

94
00:06:07,441 --> 00:06:10,877
From Where's Waldo? He's in 16 books.

95
00:06:12,195 --> 00:06:14,186
You call yourselfwell-read.

96
00:06:32,299 --> 00:06:33,493
Niles Crane.

97
00:06:33,717 --> 00:06:36,914
Maris, where are you?
You're still at the beauty parlour?

98
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:41,559
Calm down. Stop crying.
It can't be as bad as all that.

99
00:06:41,892 --> 00:06:44,247
Exactly how much hair do you have left?

100
00:06:47,189 --> 00:06:50,261
We just have to find
another character for you to be.

101
00:06:50,567 --> 00:06:53,286
There's an lonesco play
called The Bald Soprano.

102
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:58,170
No, I'm joking, Maris.
You've got to come.

103
00:06:58,492 --> 00:07:02,531
Maris, you have 37 wigs.
Go down to the wig vault and pick one.

104
00:07:04,039 --> 00:07:08,829
Maris, this evening means a great deal
to me. I need you here with me.

105
00:07:09,211 --> 00:07:11,202
Do you care about my feelings at all?

106
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,791
That answers that.

107
00:07:19,304 --> 00:07:21,295
How's the party?

108
00:07:21,557 --> 00:07:23,912
We just got here.
We had a bit of a delay.

109
00:07:24,184 --> 00:07:26,903
Sherlock led us to the wrong apartment.

110
00:07:27,187 --> 00:07:31,385
I notice you didn't complain when
the old lady gave us peanut-butter cups.

111
00:07:33,026 --> 00:07:34,823
Evening, all.

112
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:39,143
What lovely costumes.
Daphne, you look particularly beautiful.

113
00:07:39,491 --> 00:07:44,167
Thanks. It's a bit tight.
I must have put on a pound or two.

114
00:07:44,538 --> 00:07:47,211
That's enough out ofyou,
you wanton troll,

115
00:07:47,499 --> 00:07:51,128
or I'll smite your bawdy backside
with the flat of my sinewy hand.

116
00:07:51,461 --> 00:07:54,612
At least on the ride over
I could stick my head out the window.

117
00:07:54,923 --> 00:07:58,472
- Where's the bar?
- Over here. I'm serving grog and mead.

118
00:07:58,802 --> 00:08:00,793
Which one tastes most like beer?

119
00:08:03,807 --> 00:08:05,798
Roz, I'm so glad you came.

120
00:08:06,059 --> 00:08:08,857
- Any word from the doctor?
- No. I am going crazy.

121
00:08:09,146 --> 00:08:12,138
I can't even picture myself
as a mother. Can you?

122
00:08:16,028 --> 00:08:18,417
I don't think discipline
will be a problem.

123
00:08:21,074 --> 00:08:23,065
Roz, don't you look smashing.

124
00:08:23,327 --> 00:08:25,966
What an interesting costume.
Who are you?

125
00:08:26,246 --> 00:08:28,760
I'm O from The Story of O.

126
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,741
It's going to be a long night.

127
00:08:32,002 --> 00:08:35,631
I thinkyou look lovelytonight.
There's a real glow aboutyou.

128
00:08:35,964 --> 00:08:37,955
Oh, no. Not a glow.

129
00:08:39,218 --> 00:08:41,209
I'm sorry,
I'm just a little jumpy.

130
00:08:41,887 --> 00:08:45,516
I had an accident, and I haven't
found out what the damage is yet.

131
00:08:45,849 --> 00:08:48,602
I need to check my machine.
Is there a phone?

132
00:08:48,894 --> 00:08:50,612
At the top ofthe stairs.

133
00:08:50,854 --> 00:08:53,732
Try not to worry.
A few years back I got rear-ended.

134
00:08:54,024 --> 00:08:56,015
Is that what happened to you?

135
00:08:59,655 --> 00:09:01,646
Not exactly.

136
00:09:03,992 --> 00:09:05,664
- Hello.
- Hi.

137
00:09:05,911 --> 00:09:08,471
- Are you here alone?
- I hope so.

138
00:09:12,376 --> 00:09:17,655
What a delectable medley of fromagian
splendour. You must try one.

139
00:09:20,175 --> 00:09:21,164
Cheesy.

140
00:09:23,262 --> 00:09:24,741
Yes, cheesy.

141
00:09:26,431 --> 00:09:30,424
It must be glorious to have such a happy
knack for clarity and concision.

142
00:09:32,229 --> 00:09:33,218
Yep.

143
00:09:34,982 --> 00:09:36,415
Who are you?

144
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:39,881
Chingachgook.
I'm the last ofthe Mohicans.

145
00:09:40,195 --> 00:09:42,914
Well, that little mystery's solved.

146
00:09:52,207 --> 00:09:54,960
- Have you seen Roz?
- She's probably on the phone.

147
00:09:55,252 --> 00:09:57,925
Every 15 minutes
she's calling her machine.

148
00:09:58,213 --> 00:10:00,932
This little accident's
got her pretty worried.

149
00:10:01,758 --> 00:10:04,113
- She told you about it?
- Champagne?

150
00:10:04,386 --> 00:10:07,742
Not now, Niles. Please, excuse us.
We need a moment alone.

151
00:10:08,056 --> 00:10:10,775
Roz told me all about it.
It's no big deal.

152
00:10:11,059 --> 00:10:14,893
Accidents happen even when you're
careful. I had one a few years back.

153
00:10:16,398 --> 00:10:17,956
Daphne, really?

154
00:10:18,191 --> 00:10:21,149
It was one of those
real wham-bam numbers.

155
00:10:22,946 --> 00:10:25,744
He was drunk
and I wasn't paying attention.

156
00:10:27,284 --> 00:10:29,923
I called
but never got a penny out of him.

157
00:10:30,204 --> 00:10:33,037
- I had no idea.
- It's not so bad.

158
00:10:33,332 --> 00:10:36,847
Back in Manchester with all those
drunken louts out and about,

159
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:39,888
it must have happened to me
at least a dozen times.

160
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:46,910
Really? I had no... Really?

161
00:10:50,432 --> 00:10:53,742
Nothing's certain
until we get the pregnancy test results.

162
00:10:54,061 --> 00:10:57,770
Pregnancy? We're not talking
about a car accident, are we?

163
00:10:58,106 --> 00:11:00,176
- Oh, dear.
- Roz is pregnant?

164
00:11:00,442 --> 00:11:04,037
- No. Where could you get such a notion?
- You just said she was.

165
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:07,799
Shut up. Or I'm smite you
with the back of my sinewy right hand.

166
00:11:12,704 --> 00:11:15,218
- Did you notice where Frasier went?
- No idea.

167
00:11:15,499 --> 00:11:17,569
- What about Daphne?
- Haven't a clue.

168
00:11:17,834 --> 00:11:19,825
Holmes, you astound me.

169
00:11:20,963 --> 00:11:25,275
I just feel terrible about this.
Roz swore me to secrecy.

170
00:11:25,634 --> 00:11:29,149
- I never should have said anything.
- She thought I knew.

171
00:11:29,471 --> 00:11:32,224
Do you have a tissue?
These lashes are killing me.

172
00:11:32,516 --> 00:11:34,586
I must be allergic to the adhesive.

173
00:11:34,851 --> 00:11:38,560
Just promise me you won't tell a soul.
We've got to keep this secret.

174
00:11:38,897 --> 00:11:41,650
All right.
But we can't keep it a secret forever.

175
00:11:41,942 --> 00:11:44,695
We are talking about a baby.

176
00:11:47,155 --> 00:11:49,066
How could I have been so careless?

177
00:11:49,324 --> 00:11:53,476
- It's not your fault.
- You know who'll be blamed.

178
00:11:53,829 --> 00:11:56,389
Don't worry.
I'll protect your reputation.

179
00:11:57,124 --> 00:11:59,319
I'll tell everyone
I forced you to do it.

180
00:12:02,004 --> 00:12:05,917
Better get back to the party
before people start wondering about us.

181
00:12:07,676 --> 00:12:09,667
Hello, Niles.

182
00:12:10,804 --> 00:12:13,523
What's your nose
all bent out of shape about?

183
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:25,948
There's a literary figure
I'd like to know better.

184
00:12:27,112 --> 00:12:29,785
- I need a word with you.
- What about?

185
00:12:30,699 --> 00:12:32,690
Stay there. I have guests to greet.

186
00:12:36,872 --> 00:12:38,510
Trick or treat.

187
00:12:38,749 --> 00:12:42,059
- How did you get past the doorman?
- We live in the building.

188
00:12:42,377 --> 00:12:45,972
- This isn't a good night for this.
- But it's Halloween.

189
00:12:47,216 --> 00:12:50,094
Crab pufffor you,
and some gravlax for you,

190
00:12:50,385 --> 00:12:52,376
and paté for Dracula. Now offyou go.

191
00:12:54,765 --> 00:12:56,756
I need to talk to you.

192
00:12:57,017 --> 00:13:00,692
Not now, Niles.
Let me guess. Lady Godiva?

193
00:13:01,021 --> 00:13:03,012
No, Eve. From the Bible.

194
00:13:03,273 --> 00:13:06,743
Well, now I know
why they call it the Good Book.

195
00:13:07,486 --> 00:13:11,843
- Are you just going to abandon Daphne?
- Just because I gave her a ride

196
00:13:12,199 --> 00:13:14,952
doesn't mean I have to spend
the evening with her.

197
00:13:20,123 --> 00:13:22,114
Get a load of that schnozzola.

198
00:13:23,794 --> 00:13:26,592
- No, wait. Guess who I am?
- I give up.

199
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,871
I'm Waldo. From Where's Waldo?

200
00:13:29,132 --> 00:13:32,602
You know. The guy you can't find
because he blends into the crowd.

201
00:13:32,928 --> 00:13:35,442
I don't know,
but I'd love a demonstration.

202
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:43,276
And to think that all that time your cat
was curled up in your sock drawer.

203
00:13:44,314 --> 00:13:46,305
They're almost human, aren't they?

204
00:13:46,567 --> 00:13:49,001
Pardon me,
I need a word with my brother.

205
00:13:49,278 --> 00:13:53,669
Not now. I'm doing really well here.
This pointy hat is a babe magnet.

206
00:13:54,241 --> 00:13:56,277
It's urgent.

207
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:59,572
Just keep your voice down.
I'm sorry. Will you excuse me?

208
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:01,464
Hurry back.

209
00:14:02,624 --> 00:14:05,934
Your behaviour is appalling.
I can no longer hold my tongue.

210
00:14:06,253 --> 00:14:09,165
Replace tongue with liquor.
You're drunk.

211
00:14:09,464 --> 00:14:11,455
Drunk like a fox.

212
00:14:13,594 --> 00:14:17,109
- I know about the baby.
- You do? Who told you?

213
00:14:17,431 --> 00:14:21,504
- I heard it from Daphne.
- Daphne? That blabbermouth.

214
00:14:21,852 --> 00:14:23,888
I'll wring her neck.

215
00:14:24,146 --> 00:14:28,697
- Have you no conscience?
- You're getting awfully exercised.

216
00:14:29,067 --> 00:14:31,706
We're talking about a single woman
with a baby.

217
00:14:31,987 --> 00:14:36,105
- What do you intend to do about it?
- I suppose I could give her a raise.

218
00:14:38,952 --> 00:14:41,341
That's your idea of responsibility?

219
00:14:41,622 --> 00:14:43,613
What do you want me to do, marry her?

220
00:14:43,874 --> 00:14:46,342
She's the one that got pregnant.

221
00:14:46,627 --> 00:14:48,902
- Hello, Roz.
- Beat it, Niles.

222
00:14:50,172 --> 00:14:51,605
Stay here.

223
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,832
I am so mad at you.
How could you tell Niles about the baby?

224
00:14:55,135 --> 00:14:58,047
I didn't. Daphne told him,
that damnable chatterbox.

225
00:14:58,347 --> 00:15:01,817
- And who told Daphne?
- That would be me.

226
00:15:05,479 --> 00:15:08,789
What is itwith all you children?
Isn't it pastyour bedtime?

227
00:15:09,524 --> 00:15:11,594
Dr Crane, it's me, Dr Krovitz.

228
00:15:13,237 --> 00:15:16,070
Of course.
And this must be your wife, Sylvia.

229
00:15:16,365 --> 00:15:19,243
- I don't know her.
- Trick or treat.

230
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,832
I specifically
asked you not to tell anyone.

231
00:15:25,123 --> 00:15:28,672
The way she spoke sounded as if
she knew you were having a baby.

232
00:15:29,002 --> 00:15:30,993
What? You are?

233
00:15:31,505 --> 00:15:32,824
Nice going, Frasier.

234
00:15:33,048 --> 00:15:37,121
He is the master of deduction.
He would have figured it out anyway.

235
00:15:38,053 --> 00:15:40,044
Just let it out. I'm here for you.

236
00:15:40,305 --> 00:15:43,536
I keep telling you, I'm not crying.
It's my damn lashes.

237
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:47,604
Courageous and beautiful.
You shouldn't be drinking this poison.

238
00:15:48,021 --> 00:15:50,012
Here, Roz, drink this.

239
00:15:50,899 --> 00:15:54,574
- Roz, do you have a tissue?
- lfyou don't see it, I don' t have it.

240
00:15:55,404 --> 00:15:58,521
I'm sorry. Do you want
to get a napkin over here?

241
00:15:58,824 --> 00:16:00,974
Hurry back, brave girl.

242
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:04,861
Just look at her, poor thing.

243
00:16:05,122 --> 00:16:07,761
What are you talking about?

244
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:10,077
I suppose you'll find out.

245
00:16:10,335 --> 00:16:13,611
- There's a baby on the way.
- You know about that, too?

246
00:16:13,922 --> 00:16:16,595
- Who told you?
- I heard Frasier and Roz.

247
00:16:16,884 --> 00:16:19,273
You don't seem very surprised.

248
00:16:19,553 --> 00:16:22,431
I am fond of her,
but she's no Sunday school teacher.

249
00:16:22,723 --> 00:16:25,362
She's been around the block a few times.

250
00:16:26,643 --> 00:16:30,272
Instead of heaping scorn on her,
put the blame where it belongs.

251
00:16:30,606 --> 00:16:33,120
On Frasier.
The shameless Casanova.

252
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,391
What's he got to do with this?

253
00:16:35,652 --> 00:16:37,643
- He's the father.
- What?

254
00:16:37,905 --> 00:16:41,784
- I heard it from his own mouth.
- I've got to go talk to him.

255
00:16:42,117 --> 00:16:45,075
Wait.
I've just made a momentous decision.

256
00:16:46,955 --> 00:16:50,391
There's one person in this family
who still has a sense of honour.

257
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:53,781
Frasier may not be able
to do right by her, but I will.

258
00:16:54,087 --> 00:16:57,284
- What're you talking about?
- I'm going to propose to her.

259
00:16:57,591 --> 00:16:59,582
Are you nuts? You're still married.

260
00:16:59,885 --> 00:17:02,683
Maris never needed me.
But there's a woman who does.

261
00:17:02,971 --> 00:17:05,246
I didn't know you even liked her.

262
00:17:05,807 --> 00:17:07,798
Yes, I wore that mask well.

263
00:17:11,438 --> 00:17:13,633
It's time to do the honourable thing.

264
00:17:13,899 --> 00:17:18,495
Divorce your wife and marry the woman
who's carrying your brother's child?

265
00:17:20,531 --> 00:17:24,240
I've made up my mind.
Nothing's going to stop me, Dad.

266
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:29,411
There's been a bit of an hors d'oeuvre
mishap on your Persian rug.

267
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:32,702
Just call me Fumbles With Crab Puffs.

268
00:17:33,001 --> 00:17:34,673
Not now, Gil.

269
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:39,876
There's no sense fretting about it
until you know for sure.

270
00:17:40,217 --> 00:17:42,208
My eyes are just getting worse.

271
00:17:42,469 --> 00:17:44,858
I should ask Dr Crane
to take me home.

272
00:17:45,138 --> 00:17:48,130
I feel bad ruining his good time.
I was having fun, too.

273
00:17:48,433 --> 00:17:51,630
There are some very attractive men here.

274
00:17:51,937 --> 00:17:54,576
But who's going to want me
in this condition?

275
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:58,906
Don't worry about Frasier.
He'll take care ofyou.

276
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,118
That's a laugh. Beat it, Roz.

277
00:18:03,407 --> 00:18:05,762
Never mind.
I have to go check my machine.

278
00:18:06,034 --> 00:18:07,023
Daphne,

279
00:18:08,954 --> 00:18:11,343
we've known each other
for four years now.

280
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:14,615
Wait. I want to take the time
to phrase this just right.

281
00:18:14,918 --> 00:18:18,672
You take all the time you need.
I've got to go find your brother.

282
00:18:22,342 --> 00:18:24,492
Dr Crane, can I talk to you
for a moment?

283
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:28,921
I'm sorry, will you excuse me?

284
00:18:29,182 --> 00:18:33,141
It's OK. I'll go freshen my lipstick.
I feel naked without it.

285
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:37,346
Haven't you ruined my evening enough?

286
00:18:37,608 --> 00:18:40,805
- What are you talking about?
- You and your blabbermouth.

287
00:18:41,111 --> 00:18:42,942
You told Niles about the baby.

288
00:18:43,197 --> 00:18:45,995
- I did not.
- Don't play innocent with me.

289
00:18:46,283 --> 00:18:50,913
I don't mean to ruin your evening,
but I can't stay. Look at my eyes.

290
00:18:51,288 --> 00:18:53,324
I am sorry for your condition,

291
00:18:53,582 --> 00:18:57,814
but you should have read the directions
on the package before you used it.

292
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:03,918
I don't know why you're blaming
this whole mess on me.

293
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:06,732
I just know
I need a lift home right now.

294
00:19:07,012 --> 00:19:10,288
All right. I'm not leaving here
until I get Eve's number.

295
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:14,035
So sit, have a drink,
smoke a cigarette ifyou like.

296
00:19:15,229 --> 00:19:19,268
I am attracted to her and I won't let
you and your problem stand in my way.

297
00:19:19,608 --> 00:19:21,599
That's enough.

298
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,772
Lower your voice.
You're embarrassing yourself.

299
00:19:25,072 --> 00:19:27,984
I'm embarrassed
that you're my brother.

300
00:19:28,283 --> 00:19:30,274
You cad, you bounder, you roué.

301
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:33,687
What's wrong
about trying to get her number?

302
00:19:33,997 --> 00:19:37,751
We're not interested in your next
conquest but about your last one.

303
00:19:38,085 --> 00:19:40,076
And before you deny it, I have proof.

304
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:42,370
From here it smells like 80 proof.

305
00:19:44,091 --> 00:19:46,844
A woman stands here before you
in dire need.

306
00:19:47,135 --> 00:19:49,854
I can find someone else who'll take me.

307
00:19:50,138 --> 00:19:52,129
- lndeed you can.
- Niles...

308
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:54,382
Don't try to stop me.

309
00:19:55,686 --> 00:19:59,838
You seduce this poor woman and then
you aren't man enough to stand by her?

310
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:01,862
Before you make an ass...

311
00:20:02,109 --> 00:20:05,226
Stop or I'll teach you
a long overdue lesson in chivalry.

312
00:20:07,281 --> 00:20:11,240
- But, Dr Crane, you...
- No, don't defend him.

313
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:14,011
There may be one bastard in this family,

314
00:20:14,288 --> 00:20:16,802
but as long
as I have anything to say about it,

315
00:20:17,082 --> 00:20:19,391
your babywon't be another.
Daphne,

316
00:20:20,669 --> 00:20:24,184
- will you marry me?
- You drunken imbecile!

317
00:20:25,966 --> 00:20:28,844
Daphne's not the one who's pregnant.
Roz is.

318
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:34,914
- Roz is?
- Who's Roz?

319
00:20:35,183 --> 00:20:37,174
She's the one dressed like O.

320
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:43,408
That was very gallant.
Perhaps you should propose to Roz.

321
00:20:43,734 --> 00:20:47,488
If anybody's going to propose to Roz,
it's Frasier. How can you do that?

322
00:20:47,821 --> 00:20:52,178
- It was Frasier?
- I am not the father of Roz's baby.

323
00:20:52,576 --> 00:20:55,568
In fact, we don't even know for sure
if there is a baby.

324
00:20:55,871 --> 00:20:57,429
We do now.
