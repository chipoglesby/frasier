1
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:14,722
Igotyourmessageaboutthewineclub
and I'll bethere.

2
00:00:15,022 --> 00:00:20,733
Dad's kicking me outofthe house so
he and Sherry can have a little party.

3
00:00:22,154 --> 00:00:24,349
Life really is a circle, isn't it?

4
00:00:25,407 --> 00:00:29,480
Dad's using my place for a party
and just a fewyears ago,

5
00:00:29,828 --> 00:00:33,104
Dad would have to leave his house
for my parties.

6
00:00:33,415 --> 00:00:37,408
Ifyou'd had any parties,
that would be filled with irony.

7
00:00:40,339 --> 00:00:43,570
Thank goodness you're here.
I've got some shocking news.

8
00:00:43,884 --> 00:00:44,873
What is it?

9
00:00:45,093 --> 00:00:47,926
I found a ring
in your father's underwear drawer.

10
00:00:48,221 --> 00:00:52,134
What on earth would leave a ring
around his underwear drawer?

11
00:00:58,231 --> 00:01:02,110
Not around, in.
An engagement ring in a jewellery box.

12
00:01:02,444 --> 00:01:06,483
Dad must be about to ask Sherry to
marry him. Do you know what that means?

13
00:01:06,823 --> 00:01:11,977
We're going to hear what Mendelssohn's
Wedding March sounds like on the banjo.

14
00:01:12,954 --> 00:01:16,026
It means she'll be our mother.
What are we going to do?

15
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:19,609
There's nothing we can do, Niles.
It's what Dad wants.

16
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,831
What'll we call her?

17
00:01:22,089 --> 00:01:24,478
I suppose she'll want us
to call her Mother.

18
00:01:24,758 --> 00:01:28,797
No, that's too formal.
No, Mama. No, Ma.

19
00:01:29,805 --> 00:01:32,877
Better still.
Don't you look nice, Ma.

20
00:01:33,183 --> 00:01:35,617
Yes, I'd love another corn dog, Ma.

21
00:01:37,646 --> 00:01:39,921
Off to the roller derby, Ma?

22
00:01:41,024 --> 00:01:44,812
That's typical ofyou two.
Your father is about to get married,

23
00:01:45,153 --> 00:01:48,350
and all you can think about
is how itwill affect you.

24
00:01:48,657 --> 00:01:50,613
What about me?

25
00:01:50,867 --> 00:01:53,904
- What about you?
- Sherry's never exactly liked me.

26
00:01:54,204 --> 00:01:57,674
You don't think she'll try to make
your father get rid of me, do you?

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,036
No, Daphne.
He'd be lost without you.

28
00:02:00,293 --> 00:02:04,286
Yes, and even ifthat were to happen,
I could always use you.

29
00:02:04,631 --> 00:02:10,342
I mean that I would know
of a position you could take that...

30
00:02:11,805 --> 00:02:13,796
Services that you could perform...

31
00:02:14,933 --> 00:02:16,924
I would know of an opening...

32
00:02:18,979 --> 00:02:20,970
This is on me.

33
00:02:23,317 --> 00:02:27,868
Marty, you need to stir the dip more.
It's got whole lumps of soup mix in it.

34
00:02:28,238 --> 00:02:29,512
Sorry.

35
00:02:33,577 --> 00:02:36,887
Quite the little shindig
you two are planning fortonight.

36
00:02:37,205 --> 00:02:39,799
You have the cheese logs.

37
00:02:42,502 --> 00:02:44,493
Erotic fortune cookies.

38
00:02:46,048 --> 00:02:48,357
For after dinner, a bloopers tape.

39
00:02:49,718 --> 00:02:51,709
Too Hot forHee-Haw.

40
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:58,682
I see that Martha Stewart party book
I gave you really paid off.

41
00:02:59,019 --> 00:03:01,374
This crowd
wouldn't go for froufrou stuff.

42
00:03:01,647 --> 00:03:05,196
Get them liquored up, put out some
corn nuts and they can go all night.

43
00:03:05,525 --> 00:03:09,757
- When you say all night...
- Here you go, smooth as silk.

44
00:03:10,113 --> 00:03:12,229
Who's attending this soirée?

45
00:03:12,491 --> 00:03:14,959
Just some old friends
I'm dying for Marty to meet.

46
00:03:15,243 --> 00:03:17,677
Now let's see,
there's Ray and Lola Sherwood.

47
00:03:17,954 --> 00:03:23,187
I worked with them in Atlantic City
when they had a knife-throwing act.

48
00:03:23,585 --> 00:03:26,941
Marty, try not to stare at her eye.
She gets self-conscious.

49
00:03:30,133 --> 00:03:32,124
And let's see.

50
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:35,564
Edie's coming with her new fiancé.

51
00:03:35,847 --> 00:03:40,523
- She finally met him, huh?
- Just this week.

52
00:03:40,894 --> 00:03:43,362
They're engaged,
and they met this weekend?

53
00:03:43,647 --> 00:03:48,163
Well, up until now, it's been kind
of a pen-pal relationship. He's been...

54
00:03:48,527 --> 00:03:51,121
detained the last few years.

55
00:03:52,447 --> 00:03:54,836
You'll need some room
for those corn nuts.

56
00:03:55,117 --> 00:03:59,349
Why don't I just get this pesky
priceless sculpture out ofyour way?

57
00:03:59,705 --> 00:04:02,697
I never heard from Vic and Linda.
Did you get a message?

58
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,276
- No.
- Maybe they left one on my machine.

59
00:04:07,796 --> 00:04:09,787
So what're you guys up to tonight?

60
00:04:15,095 --> 00:04:18,371
Our wine club is having
a vertical tasting ofthe Opus One.

61
00:04:18,682 --> 00:04:20,718
Well, don't drink too much.

62
00:04:20,976 --> 00:04:24,889
You don't drink the wine. You
just swish it around and spit it out.

63
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:28,905
We all did that at Duke's
New Year's Eve party.

64
00:04:29,234 --> 00:04:31,429
Course it wasn't wine, it was egg salad.

65
00:04:34,573 --> 00:04:37,724
I just got a message
from my manager down at McGinty's.

66
00:04:38,035 --> 00:04:40,754
Some guy came in
asking questions about me.

67
00:04:41,038 --> 00:04:43,029
What kind of questions?

68
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:45,929
Where I used to work,
the people I used to date,

69
00:04:46,209 --> 00:04:49,406
and my neighbour said somebody
asked her about me, too.

70
00:04:49,838 --> 00:04:52,591
- Somebody's checking up on you.
- Like a detective?

71
00:04:52,883 --> 00:04:56,273
It's probably a credit card company.
I wouldn't worry about it.

72
00:04:56,595 --> 00:04:59,393
It is a little scary.
I wish I knew who it was.

73
00:04:59,681 --> 00:05:02,400
Forget it, honey.
I've been through this before.

74
00:05:02,726 --> 00:05:05,365
Private investigators
never leave a trail.

75
00:05:05,646 --> 00:05:07,876
- It could be anyone.
- If you say so.

76
00:05:08,148 --> 00:05:12,141
- Which one ofyou hired him?
- That is just crazy.

77
00:05:12,527 --> 00:05:14,757
Who else would have the money
to do that?

78
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:17,021
We had nothing to do with it.

79
00:05:17,282 --> 00:05:19,842
Do you think we'd
hire someone to spy on Sherry?

80
00:05:20,118 --> 00:05:22,996
- I'm insulted.
- As am l.

81
00:05:24,039 --> 00:05:27,190
- I jumped to the wrong conclusion.
- You certainly have.

82
00:05:27,501 --> 00:05:30,061
- I'm sorry, boys.
- It's all right, Dad.

83
00:05:30,337 --> 00:05:32,373
Just forget about it.

84
00:05:32,631 --> 00:05:34,826
You hired a detective? How could you?

85
00:05:35,092 --> 00:05:37,162
I have never been so insulted.

86
00:05:37,427 --> 00:05:40,544
OK, I'm sorry.
I'm just looking out for Dad here.

87
00:05:40,847 --> 00:05:42,997
What do we
really know about this woman?

88
00:05:43,266 --> 00:05:45,734
She makes Dad happy.
That's all we need to know.

89
00:05:46,019 --> 00:05:50,376
Some people get married before they know
all they should. Remember cousin Donald?

90
00:05:50,732 --> 00:05:54,805
He was married two years before
he found out his wife used to be a man.

91
00:05:55,153 --> 00:05:59,465
Cousin Donald is a rare case.
Most people don't have a hidden past.

92
00:05:59,825 --> 00:06:03,101
And most people have a better eye
for details than Donald.

93
00:06:03,412 --> 00:06:06,882
The woman could pick up
a watermelon with one hand.

94
00:06:09,501 --> 00:06:13,380
I was just simply trying to get
some background information.

95
00:06:13,714 --> 00:06:15,989
Well, stop it.

96
00:06:17,551 --> 00:06:20,304
- Call it off right now, Niles.
- Consider it done.

97
00:06:20,595 --> 00:06:22,984
- We've got to run.
- Yeah. Goodbye.

98
00:06:23,265 --> 00:06:26,382
Have a nice time, you two.
We'll save you some cake.

99
00:06:26,685 --> 00:06:29,324
Thank you.
You see that, how sweet she is?

100
00:06:29,604 --> 00:06:34,200
I can't believe you're having her
investigated. Try trusting people.

101
00:06:40,657 --> 00:06:44,650
- Quick, is someone following me?
- Yes, here comes Lady Law now.

102
00:06:44,995 --> 00:06:48,305
Excuse me, ma'am,
I saw you cross against the light.

103
00:06:48,623 --> 00:06:50,773
I'm going to have to write you a ticket.

104
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:54,638
I'm really sorry about that.
It's just that it's so cold out there,

105
00:06:54,963 --> 00:06:59,195
and the pollution, and I didn't
want to expose my unborn child

106
00:06:59,551 --> 00:07:01,940
to the elements any longer
than I needed to.

107
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:06,577
You're pregnant.
I know a little bit about that myself.

108
00:07:06,933 --> 00:07:09,970
Then you know exactly
what I'm talking about.

109
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:13,706
Society doesn't go easy
on pregnant ladies, does it?

110
00:07:14,024 --> 00:07:16,219
So when are you due?

111
00:07:16,485 --> 00:07:19,363
I'm not pregnant.

112
00:07:22,658 --> 00:07:25,047
That's Roz Doyle.

113
00:07:25,327 --> 00:07:27,636
Do you want to step over here, please?

114
00:07:29,998 --> 00:07:33,354
- Hello, Niles.
- Hello, Frasier. May I borrow your pen?

115
00:07:33,669 --> 00:07:35,944
Certainly. How do you do?

116
00:07:36,797 --> 00:07:38,788
I appreciate all your hard work

117
00:07:39,049 --> 00:07:42,519
and I am sorry to have to break off
the investigation in the middle.

118
00:07:42,844 --> 00:07:45,404
People change their minds all the time.

119
00:07:45,681 --> 00:07:47,797
I'm sure they do. There you are.

120
00:07:48,058 --> 00:07:50,492
Thank you. Goodbye.

121
00:07:52,187 --> 00:07:55,941
- There, now don't you feel better?
- I suppose so.

122
00:07:56,274 --> 00:07:58,390
You have to admit
I was right on this one.

123
00:07:58,652 --> 00:08:02,281
You had no justification
for giving in to your baser instincts

124
00:08:02,614 --> 00:08:04,923
and prying into Sherry's past.

125
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:09,318
I almost forgot. I wrote up a little
report on what I found out so far.

126
00:08:09,663 --> 00:08:12,177
That's one interesting lady.

127
00:08:18,755 --> 00:08:21,189
I should've told him
to drop it in the trash.

128
00:08:21,466 --> 00:08:23,741
We're concerned with Dad's happiness.

129
00:08:24,011 --> 00:08:28,880
Sometimes you are like a beacon,
piercing the fog of my baser instincts.

130
00:08:29,266 --> 00:08:32,178
- Miss, would you drop that in the...
- Give me that.

131
00:08:34,187 --> 00:08:37,497
You've proven your point.
I hate myself for what I'm doing.

132
00:08:37,816 --> 00:08:40,250
We're doing it for Dad's own good.

133
00:08:40,652 --> 00:08:43,530
So far, so good.

134
00:08:44,573 --> 00:08:46,882
Graduated from high school.

135
00:08:48,493 --> 00:08:50,484
Almost paid off her Subaru.

136
00:08:51,413 --> 00:08:54,803
- Did you know she'd been married?
- Yes, she mentioned that.

137
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:57,116
To Johnny Dempsey.

138
00:08:57,377 --> 00:09:02,132
There were two others/
Ned Foley, Marc Wallace.

139
00:09:02,507 --> 00:09:05,783
That's a bit troubling.
Three previous marriages?

140
00:09:06,845 --> 00:09:08,836
Vincent Mayhew.

141
00:09:09,931 --> 00:09:12,491
Milton Mandell.

142
00:09:13,977 --> 00:09:16,093
- Walt...
- Just give me the total.

143
00:09:16,355 --> 00:09:17,834
Six. That we know of.

144
00:09:18,065 --> 00:09:21,978
You had to go and fire that
detective before he finished his report.

145
00:09:22,319 --> 00:09:24,310
Six husbands.

146
00:09:25,739 --> 00:09:29,049
She's obviously incapable
of remaining in a relationship.

147
00:09:29,368 --> 00:09:31,438
Doesn't bode well for the marriage.

148
00:09:31,703 --> 00:09:35,696
On the upside, it does bode well for Dad
getting a "yes" when he proposes.

149
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:39,275
He has a right to know about this.

150
00:09:39,544 --> 00:09:42,661
We told him we weren't
involved in the investigation.

151
00:09:42,965 --> 00:09:47,004
Maybe we can impart the information
without explaining how we came by it.

152
00:09:47,344 --> 00:09:50,495
- Drop it in the conversation.
- And how would that go?

153
00:09:50,806 --> 00:09:54,355
"Dad, going to the Sherry
Ex-Husband Convention this year?"

154
00:09:56,144 --> 00:09:58,180
Besides, Dad may know already.

155
00:09:58,438 --> 00:10:00,508
I think we need to find that out.

156
00:10:00,774 --> 00:10:05,723
What if Dad marries her and in a year
he's tossed aside like Danny Mitchell?

157
00:10:06,113 --> 00:10:09,105
- Who's that?
- Page five. Engaged, but never married.

158
00:10:13,745 --> 00:10:15,701
- Hey, boys.
- Hey, Dad.

159
00:10:15,956 --> 00:10:20,746
What do you think about this jacket?
Something doesn't quite feel right.

160
00:10:21,128 --> 00:10:23,164
- I think it's nice.
- Really?

161
00:10:23,422 --> 00:10:25,811
Dad, I was talking with a lady today.

162
00:10:26,091 --> 00:10:29,606
I happened to mention
that I had been married twice before.

163
00:10:29,928 --> 00:10:34,365
A look clouded over her face as if
I had confessed to some unspeakable sin.

164
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:40,424
And people who've been married more
than that. Quite a taboo they face.

165
00:10:40,814 --> 00:10:42,930
I don't know. It's so...

166
00:10:43,191 --> 00:10:46,627
I think it all harkens back
to the puritanical streak

167
00:10:46,945 --> 00:10:50,301
that still runs through this country.
What do you think?

168
00:10:50,615 --> 00:10:54,767
There's a yakety-yak streak
that runs through this family.

169
00:10:55,454 --> 00:10:57,729
Maybe it's the shirt.
You like this shirt?

170
00:10:57,998 --> 00:10:59,556
Yes, it's nice.

171
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:02,464
Might make a good topic
to discuss on my show.

172
00:11:02,753 --> 00:11:06,109
The hurdles that are faced
by people with multiple marriages.

173
00:11:06,423 --> 00:11:11,577
Hard to round up enough people
who've been married a lot of times.

174
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:13,961
- Do you know anyone?
- No, I don't.

175
00:11:14,222 --> 00:11:16,417
Mrs Kranz upstairs...

176
00:11:18,226 --> 00:11:21,377
- How about you, Dad?
- Sure, I know some people.

177
00:11:21,688 --> 00:11:23,280
Really, you do?

178
00:11:23,523 --> 00:11:25,081
- I think.
- You think?

179
00:11:25,317 --> 00:11:27,911
Maybe I do, maybe I don't.
I hate this shirt.

180
00:11:28,195 --> 00:11:30,186
I've got to change this shirt.

181
00:11:32,449 --> 00:11:36,237
- That was fruitless.
- I'll tell you one thing I'm sure of.

182
00:11:37,663 --> 00:11:39,381
Yes?

183
00:11:39,623 --> 00:11:42,183
Oh, I'm allowed to talk now, am l?

184
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:47,365
I've never seen your father so nervous.

185
00:11:47,631 --> 00:11:51,306
He's meeting Sherry
and I bet he'll pop the question.

186
00:11:51,635 --> 00:11:54,672
- We have to tell him.
- But we don't know what he knows.

187
00:11:54,972 --> 00:11:57,406
If she'd told him
she'd been married six times,

188
00:11:57,683 --> 00:12:00,641
- he would remember.
- Who, Sherry?

189
00:12:00,936 --> 00:12:04,008
Maybe this shirt isn't so bad
with this new jacket.

190
00:12:04,314 --> 00:12:06,748
- What do you think ofthis jacket?
- It's nice.

191
00:12:07,025 --> 00:12:09,778
Sherry's been married six times?

192
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:13,346
- Who told you that?
- They did.

193
00:12:18,954 --> 00:12:20,945
What's this all about?

194
00:12:21,206 --> 00:12:24,801
I'd love to see the first shirt
with the second jacket.

195
00:12:25,127 --> 00:12:28,517
You got this from the investigator.
You did hire him.

196
00:12:28,839 --> 00:12:33,037
I guess there's no use in denying it.
Yes, we did hire him.

197
00:12:33,385 --> 00:12:36,775
Although the word "we"
is not entirely accurate.

198
00:12:37,097 --> 00:12:40,134
- Frasier, I am shocked that...
- Shut up, Niles.

199
00:12:42,853 --> 00:12:48,644
Dad, we were just concerned about you.
We know about the engagement ring.

200
00:12:49,067 --> 00:12:52,377
- Who went through my drawers?
- Pointing fingers won't help.

201
00:12:52,696 --> 00:12:55,130
- What's the matter with you?
- She did it.

202
00:12:59,036 --> 00:13:02,711
It's nice to know there isn't a
single person in this house I can trust.

203
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,871
Sherry told me about her marriages.

204
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:08,117
I didn't tell you because
it's none ofyour damn business,

205
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:12,095
just like it's none ofyour business
who I marry or who I don't marry.

206
00:13:12,424 --> 00:13:15,939
I don't know why
I'm even wasting my time talking to you.

207
00:13:16,261 --> 00:13:19,253
See what I get
for confiding in you two blabbermouths.

208
00:13:19,556 --> 00:13:22,912
Next time I find something
in your father's underwear drawer,

209
00:13:23,226 --> 00:13:25,296
I'm just going to sit on it.

210
00:13:34,404 --> 00:13:36,395
This evening is an entire disaster.

211
00:13:37,366 --> 00:13:42,394
I'm already late for dinner with Maris.
I don't know how this could've happened.

212
00:13:42,788 --> 00:13:47,225
Who'd have guessed that something so
innocent as spying on a man's girlfriend

213
00:13:47,584 --> 00:13:51,577
and rifling his underwear drawer
could turn so ugly?

214
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:57,830
There is one consolation. We told Dad
the truth and could bear his anger.

215
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:02,179
That's the nice thing about
our relationship. We're all adults.

216
00:14:02,516 --> 00:14:05,588
We're not afraid of confrontation.

217
00:14:05,894 --> 00:14:09,011
Stop stalling, Niles.
Dad must be in the elevator by now.

218
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,675
Look what I found
in your father's jacket.

219
00:14:13,944 --> 00:14:16,412
- I do not want to know.
- He forgot the ring.

220
00:14:16,697 --> 00:14:18,688
This will be embarrassing for him.

221
00:14:18,949 --> 00:14:22,658
- I suppose I could take it down to him.
- No, Daphne, I should do that.

222
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:26,465
It'll give me an excellent opportunity
to show him how happy I am

223
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:29,588
- that he's marrying Sherry.
- That would be nice.

224
00:14:29,876 --> 00:14:33,994
I can't figure out why he would propose
in McGinty's.

225
00:14:34,339 --> 00:14:36,853
It's so shabby.

226
00:14:37,134 --> 00:14:40,171
Well, I guess maybe
he was just trying to match the ring.

227
00:14:45,309 --> 00:14:49,860
So I told herthatyou and l
would take a trip up there this spring.

228
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:53,063
- Well, you like my sister, right?
- Yeah, sure.

229
00:14:53,358 --> 00:14:57,033
You can't hold
one embarrassing moment against her.

230
00:14:57,362 --> 00:14:59,512
She didn't know you were in there.

231
00:15:01,116 --> 00:15:03,869
No, I don't. No, I like your sister.

232
00:15:04,619 --> 00:15:07,770
Well, then what is wrong with you?
You're being so quiet.

233
00:15:08,081 --> 00:15:11,676
- I got something on my mind.
- Well, what is it?

234
00:15:12,961 --> 00:15:15,759
I've been thinking
a lot about us, and...

235
00:15:18,133 --> 00:15:20,488
Where do you see us going?

236
00:15:20,761 --> 00:15:24,231
I don't know. I mean,
I'm having fun the way things are.

237
00:15:24,556 --> 00:15:27,514
You have your life, I have mine.
No pressure.

238
00:15:28,101 --> 00:15:29,819
That's what I thought you'd say.

239
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:32,417
Is there something wrong
with having fun?

240
00:15:32,689 --> 00:15:37,444
No. We've been just having fun
for a long time now.

241
00:15:37,819 --> 00:15:43,496
Let me ask you something. Where
do you see us in a year? Five years?

242
00:15:47,162 --> 00:15:50,393
I don't know.
I try not to look too far ahead.

243
00:15:50,707 --> 00:15:53,426
That's the difference between us.

244
00:15:54,878 --> 00:15:57,597
Because I can't stop thinking
that far ahead.

245
00:16:01,259 --> 00:16:07,095
I've come to realise, Sherry,
that I want to get married again.

246
00:16:08,517 --> 00:16:11,987
And, you know, that's
not anything that you're interested in.

247
00:16:12,813 --> 00:16:17,887
Well, can you blame me?
I mean, Marty, you know my track record.

248
00:16:18,276 --> 00:16:21,951
I've been down that road a lot of times.

249
00:16:25,283 --> 00:16:28,275
I've learned the hard way.
I'm not looking for forever.

250
00:16:28,578 --> 00:16:30,330
Well...

251
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:33,557
I am.

252
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:36,560
So you're breaking up with me?

253
00:16:38,588 --> 00:16:42,547
We're just looking for different things,
Sherry. I'm sorry.

254
00:16:46,555 --> 00:16:49,069
- It's hot in here.
- Yeah.

255
00:16:57,107 --> 00:17:00,417
Dad, fancy seeing you here.
Can I speak with you for a second?

256
00:17:00,736 --> 00:17:02,727
Will you get out of here?

257
00:17:02,988 --> 00:17:06,947
I've got something you might want
before you tell Sherry...

258
00:17:07,284 --> 00:17:10,037
He's already told me.

259
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:12,365
He has?

260
00:17:12,622 --> 00:17:16,456
Well, that is just wonderful.
And may I say, it's about time.

261
00:17:17,294 --> 00:17:20,206
- I couldn't be happier for you.
- That's nice to know.

262
00:17:20,505 --> 00:17:26,216
Dad, I'd like you to know that
everybody is 100% behind this decision.

263
00:17:26,637 --> 00:17:30,789
I'm so glad thatyou're so happy
yourfather is breaking up with me.

264
00:17:32,225 --> 00:17:34,659
Breaking up?

265
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,431
I had no idea.

266
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:44,890
And you get paid to help people
through their difficult moments in life?

267
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:53,194
It isn't easy saying goodbye, is it?

268
00:17:53,455 --> 00:17:58,449
No. It doesn't get any easier either.
I should know.

269
00:18:00,045 --> 00:18:04,994
Listen, Marty, this is usually the time
people say, "Well, let's be friends".

270
00:18:05,384 --> 00:18:11,016
And then there's a phone call or two,
but they never see each other again.

271
00:18:12,933 --> 00:18:18,565
Well, I just want you to know that I am
around for you ifyou ever get lonely

272
00:18:18,981 --> 00:18:22,132
or you just need to talk.

273
00:18:26,822 --> 00:18:27,811
Thanks.

274
00:18:30,951 --> 00:18:33,909
And when you call,
if a man answers, hang up.

275
00:18:55,183 --> 00:18:56,172
Hi, Dad.

276
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:00,454
Obviously I came down here
to bring you this.

277
00:19:02,399 --> 00:19:05,994
Obviously I made another
colossal blunder in a week full ofthem.

278
00:19:07,904 --> 00:19:09,895
I'm really sorry, Dad.

279
00:19:12,534 --> 00:19:15,765
I guess you don't really
feel like talking, huh?

280
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:21,836
You know, Frasier, sometimes I just
feel like sitting and watching a game.

281
00:19:23,754 --> 00:19:27,190
Fine. I can do that.
Yeah. Sure.

282
00:19:30,052 --> 00:19:33,089
Well, so the Sonics and...

283
00:19:34,097 --> 00:19:35,086
Bulls.

284
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:39,114
That Jordan,
he's really something, huh? Yeah.

285
00:19:40,937 --> 00:19:43,326
The way he scores those points

286
00:19:46,026 --> 00:19:48,904
and gets the ball back
when the other team misses.

287
00:19:50,238 --> 00:19:54,356
That's incredible. He made
the same impossible shot twice in a row.

288
00:19:54,701 --> 00:19:57,010
It's the instant replay.

289
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:05,367
You know, I was carrying this thing
around for a month.

290
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:07,901
- Really?
- Yeah.

291
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:15,625
But at the end of every night,
I just couldn't pop the question.

292
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:22,279
And then I realised it was because
I knew what the answer would be.

293
00:20:23,605 --> 00:20:25,641
She didn't want to get married again.

294
00:20:27,651 --> 00:20:30,006
- I'm sorry, Dad.
- It's all right.

295
00:20:30,278 --> 00:20:34,510
Maybe it wouldn't have
worked out between us anyway.

296
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:36,584
Your mom's a hard act to follow.

297
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:42,090
I never went through
anything like this with her.

298
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:48,339
We knew we were meant to be together.
And that was that.

299
00:20:51,008 --> 00:20:52,999
It's hard to find that out there.

300
00:20:54,469 --> 00:20:56,744
I've been trying for a while.

301
00:20:59,266 --> 00:21:01,826
You'll get there.

302
00:21:04,187 --> 00:21:06,223
Hope we both do.

303
00:21:07,607 --> 00:21:09,598
You know, Dad, in time...

304
00:21:16,366 --> 00:21:19,324
That was quite a shot.

305
00:21:19,619 --> 00:21:21,814
Yeah, Payton's been pretty hot lately.

306
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,640
- What's the score?
- Sonics are down by five.

307
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:27,066
Got a chance if they can hold Jordan.

308
00:21:27,336 --> 00:21:30,294
- Can I get a beer here, please?
- Yeah, make that two.
