1
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,352
That's all the time we have, Seattle.

2
00:00:12,644 --> 00:00:17,160
This is Dr Frasier Crane wishing you
good afternoon and good mental health.

3
00:00:18,608 --> 00:00:21,076
If I ask your opinion about something,

4
00:00:21,361 --> 00:00:23,477
will you give me an honest answer?

5
00:00:23,739 --> 00:00:28,051
Absolutely, Roz. Any time.
All you have to do is ask.

6
00:00:32,289 --> 00:00:34,928
- I knew it.
- No, I'm just kidding. I love it.

7
00:00:35,208 --> 00:00:36,527
It looks great.

8
00:00:36,752 --> 00:00:38,822
- Are you sure?
- Trust me.

9
00:00:39,087 --> 00:00:41,681
It's just in my condition
I'm a little insecure.

10
00:00:41,965 --> 00:00:44,604
Every time
I see something cute in the window,

11
00:00:44,885 --> 00:00:47,035
I remember how I look
and I think no way.

12
00:00:48,263 --> 00:00:51,460
- Here we go again.
- That's my cousin.

13
00:00:51,767 --> 00:00:55,237
- Nikos, what are you doing here?
- I was in the neighbourhood.

14
00:00:55,562 --> 00:00:57,553
It's great to see you.
It's been ages.

15
00:00:57,814 --> 00:00:59,930
Meet my producer Roz Doyle.

16
00:01:00,192 --> 00:01:02,786
This is Nikos,
my father's brother's son.

17
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:05,300
I would've never pegged you for a Crane.

18
00:01:05,572 --> 00:01:10,123
- He gets his looks from his mom.
- Bet he gets looks from lots of women.

19
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:14,771
- It's nice to meet you.
- I never knew Frasier had a cousin.

20
00:01:15,082 --> 00:01:18,916
He's ashamed of me. Why else would
he turn down my wedding invitation?

21
00:01:19,252 --> 00:01:21,846
- You're getting married?
- Yeah, on Saturday.

22
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:24,883
- You didn't get the invitation.
- No.

23
00:01:25,175 --> 00:01:28,804
I knew Mom was lying when she said
she never heard back from you.

24
00:01:29,137 --> 00:01:31,697
She must still be nursing that grudge.

25
00:01:31,974 --> 00:01:34,363
This sounds like private family stuff.

26
00:01:34,643 --> 00:01:37,715
So, what's this grudge
you're talking about?

27
00:01:38,021 --> 00:01:42,094
Mom has never forgiven Frasier
for some career advice he gave me.

28
00:01:42,442 --> 00:01:45,593
And, trust me, he saved me
from going down the wrong path.

29
00:01:45,904 --> 00:01:49,817
Thank you, Nikos.
I certainly hate to miss this wedding.

30
00:01:50,158 --> 00:01:53,070
I wonder ifthere's some way
we could work this out.

31
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:56,089
- So, what was the wrong path?
- It's a long story.

32
00:01:56,373 --> 00:01:58,807
My folks wanted me
to go to medical school.

33
00:01:59,084 --> 00:02:01,279
- What did you choose?
- We don't have...

34
00:02:01,545 --> 00:02:04,503
I became a juggler.

35
00:02:04,798 --> 00:02:06,789
I perform on street corners.

36
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:10,759
I see.
And all because of his advice.

37
00:02:11,096 --> 00:02:14,611
- Do people sometimes toss you coins?
- Sure. Lots of times.

38
00:02:14,933 --> 00:02:17,447
Well, here's something
you can catch them in.

39
00:02:23,442 --> 00:02:25,433
It's all your fault.

40
00:02:25,694 --> 00:02:29,733
I have to monitor your blood pressure
and I'd like an accurate reading.

41
00:02:30,073 --> 00:02:33,543
- Why don't we try to solve this?
- She's a vindictive woman

42
00:02:33,869 --> 00:02:35,985
and she'll keep punishing us.

43
00:02:36,246 --> 00:02:40,524
Ifyou'd keptyour big trap shut my
nephewwould probably be a surgeon now

44
00:02:40,876 --> 00:02:43,026
and I'd be going to his wedding.

45
00:02:43,295 --> 00:02:47,846
240 over 1 1.
That sounds about right.

46
00:02:48,216 --> 00:02:51,526
I'd loved to have gone,
but this is clearly a snub

47
00:02:51,845 --> 00:02:53,995
and we Crane men have our pride.

48
00:02:54,264 --> 00:02:56,824
You're just afraid
of seeing Cousin Yvonne.

49
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,692
Who's Cousin Yvonne?

50
00:02:58,935 --> 00:03:01,495
A distant cousin
who has a slight crush on Niles.

51
00:03:01,772 --> 00:03:05,367
A slight crush. There are cannibals
who are less man-hungry.

52
00:03:05,692 --> 00:03:08,843
It would be romantic
to have a secret admirer.

53
00:03:09,154 --> 00:03:12,271
Someone who longed for me that much.
But I do see your point.

54
00:03:12,574 --> 00:03:16,283
When you think about it,
it is kind of sick.

55
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:19,817
Perhaps sick is a tad judgemental.

56
00:03:20,123 --> 00:03:23,957
Because ofyour big mouth Zora
won't even let me in her restaurant.

57
00:03:24,294 --> 00:03:26,285
Forcing you to go elsewhere

58
00:03:26,546 --> 00:03:30,221
when you have a craving for stuffed
grape leaves and zither music.

59
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:35,260
It's a moot point. We're not invited,
thanks to Frasier's inept advice.

60
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:38,711
Can you imagine
living in the same city as your brother

61
00:03:39,017 --> 00:03:42,646
- and not see him for five years?
- No, but I'd like to give it a try.

62
00:03:45,649 --> 00:03:48,117
Dad, I think
we should go to this wedding.

63
00:03:48,402 --> 00:03:51,519
- Zora doesn't want us there.
- But Nikos wants us there.

64
00:03:51,822 --> 00:03:54,461
I watched him grow up.
I want to see him get married.

65
00:03:54,741 --> 00:03:58,654
I'd like to venture an opinion here.
I know this doesn't concern me,

66
00:03:58,996 --> 00:04:03,592
but I feel very strongly about this.
I like zither music and I always have.

67
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:10,234
And we're back. Listen, Dad...

68
00:04:10,507 --> 00:04:14,182
Drop it, Frasier.
If my brother's wife doesn't see fit

69
00:04:14,511 --> 00:04:17,901
to send me an invitation,
I am not just going to show up.

70
00:04:18,223 --> 00:04:21,852
End of story. Case closed.
That's all she wrote.

71
00:04:22,185 --> 00:04:25,302
There are more important issues
at stake here

72
00:04:25,605 --> 00:04:28,995
than you being mauled
by Yvonne the Terrible.

73
00:04:29,318 --> 00:04:31,548
Dad is hurt. Can't you see that?

74
00:04:32,154 --> 00:04:37,274
He misses his brother. This is my fault,
and I'm going to put it right.

75
00:04:37,659 --> 00:04:42,096
I'm going to get in touch with Aunt
Zora. Surely she'll listen to reason.

76
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:46,471
Aunt Zora.

77
00:04:48,462 --> 00:04:52,137
Well, that's encouraging.
She remembered my voice.

78
00:04:53,884 --> 00:04:55,681
Frasier, just give up.

79
00:04:55,927 --> 00:05:00,000
No. She can't avoid me
if I go to that restaurant.

80
00:05:00,349 --> 00:05:03,546
- Do you have a death wish?
- I'm not afraid of her.

81
00:05:03,852 --> 00:05:08,721
Have you forgotten that when Hitler
invaded Greece, she joined the partisans

82
00:05:09,107 --> 00:05:12,861
- so she could strangle Nazis?
- I have never believed that.

83
00:05:13,195 --> 00:05:15,390
She would have been five at the time.

84
00:05:15,656 --> 00:05:19,331
That's why the legend says
they were strangled with jump ropes.

85
00:05:31,171 --> 00:05:34,368
Dimitri, pick up your order.
Don't make me hurt you again.

86
00:05:43,433 --> 00:05:48,029
Aunt Zora, I realise I'm not the most
welcome person here but...

87
00:05:50,273 --> 00:05:53,788
It is not fair to take my mistake
out on your husband or my father.

88
00:05:54,111 --> 00:05:56,989
- They didn't do anything.
- More pepper.

89
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,510
You have a wedding.
You should be joyous.

90
00:05:59,783 --> 00:06:01,774
Sponge offthis countertop.

91
00:06:02,035 --> 00:06:06,074
Nikos says his fiancée's a lovely
woman and you like her very much.

92
00:06:06,415 --> 00:06:08,975
You should be full of motherly emotions.

93
00:06:09,251 --> 00:06:13,324
When I find out who bent this skewer,
I'm ramming it right in his eye.

94
00:06:13,672 --> 00:06:18,621
I've always wanted to do this,
make a trip around the Greek islands.

95
00:06:25,225 --> 00:06:26,704
Aunt Zora,

96
00:06:26,935 --> 00:06:30,245
my point is that we are family.

97
00:06:30,564 --> 00:06:33,032
And we should be together.

98
00:06:33,317 --> 00:06:36,434
And I promise ifyou invite us
to this wedding, I will...

99
00:06:36,737 --> 00:06:40,412
never give Nikos another piece of advice
for as long as I live.

100
00:06:40,741 --> 00:06:45,417
I'm through meddling. You have my word.
And ifyou do invite us to the wedding,

101
00:06:45,787 --> 00:06:51,384
I'll promote this wonderful restaurant
ofyours on my radio programme.

102
00:06:52,419 --> 00:06:53,977
Every day.

103
00:06:54,212 --> 00:06:56,442
For a... month.

104
00:06:57,382 --> 00:06:58,940
Frasier.

105
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:03,692
- You forgive me.
- Of course.

106
00:07:03,972 --> 00:07:07,408
And you come
to the rehearsal dinner, too.

107
00:07:07,726 --> 00:07:09,762
Tomorrow night, right here.

108
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:14,571
Here, eat, my very special kokoretsi

109
00:07:14,941 --> 00:07:17,375
for a very special nephew.

110
00:07:17,653 --> 00:07:21,441
I'm such a softy.
I'll be crying in a minute.

111
00:07:21,782 --> 00:07:23,773
Me, too.

112
00:07:36,421 --> 00:07:39,970
I hope you enjoy yourself,
Mr "Blessed Are The Peacemakers".

113
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:43,098
Stop complaining.
The rehearsal went beautifully.

114
00:07:43,387 --> 00:07:45,378
Cousin Yvonne didn't get near you.

115
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:48,597
How could she?
I hid in the confessional.

116
00:07:48,892 --> 00:07:51,964
By the way,
Mrs Pappas is having an affair.

117
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:54,500
Here they are. My two favourite nephews.

118
00:07:58,193 --> 00:08:00,388
Ed, get me with the boys.

119
00:08:02,322 --> 00:08:05,200
I am so glad you are coming
to the wedding tomorrow.

120
00:08:05,492 --> 00:08:09,167
There is nothing sadder
than a divided family. Am I right?

121
00:08:09,496 --> 00:08:13,694
When Frasier said we weren't
invited I remember thinking...

122
00:08:14,042 --> 00:08:16,761
- There you are, Niles.
- Just kill me now.

123
00:08:18,755 --> 00:08:21,986
- Hello, Yvonne.
- I haven't seen you two in a long time.

124
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:27,011
I haven't seen your two in a long time.
You too. Your... You too.

125
00:08:27,389 --> 00:08:30,938
We've got a lot of catching up to do.
Let's go get us a glass of bubbly.

126
00:08:31,268 --> 00:08:35,466
- I don't think...
- It's none of that sissy French wine.

127
00:08:35,814 --> 00:08:39,648
- It's real Greek champagne.
- Save some for me, Niles.

128
00:08:41,403 --> 00:08:46,272
And here he is,
my favourite brother-in-law, Marty.

129
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:50,523
- It's been too long.
- It sure has. Say, where's Walt?

130
00:08:50,829 --> 00:08:54,299
- We've got a lot of catching up to do.
- Don't worry, he'll be here.

131
00:08:54,624 --> 00:08:56,979
Who is this pretty young thing?

132
00:08:57,252 --> 00:09:00,767
This is Daphne Moon,
my physical therapist.

133
00:09:01,089 --> 00:09:04,604
That's what they call it these days.
You dirty old man.

134
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:09,374
This is my fiancée, Mary Ann Taubeneck.

135
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:13,997
Mary Ann. It's a pleasure.
Taubeneck, as in the Taubeneck Building?

136
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:17,550
Yeah, and Taubeneck Park,
etcetera, etcetera.

137
00:09:17,856 --> 00:09:20,893
That was my grandfather,
the original robber baron.

138
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:25,311
- Mary Ann has issues with her family.
- Look at them sulking over there.

139
00:09:25,656 --> 00:09:29,649
You should've seen them when I told them
I was marrying a street person.

140
00:09:29,993 --> 00:09:32,632
- Street performer.
- Right.

141
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:36,367
They've got it coming
after all the debutante nonsense

142
00:09:36,667 --> 00:09:39,579
they put me through.
Would you excuse me?

143
00:09:41,922 --> 00:09:45,801
- She's great, isn't she?
- Yes. How did you two meet?

144
00:09:46,134 --> 00:09:49,365
I performed at one
of her parents' garden parties.

145
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,877
They were snooty to me.
That sparked something in her.

146
00:09:53,183 --> 00:09:57,335
She asked me for a date. She likes
to play with her parents' heads.

147
00:09:57,688 --> 00:10:01,158
Yes, well, so did Lizzie Borden.

148
00:10:01,483 --> 00:10:03,474
What do you mean?

149
00:10:03,735 --> 00:10:08,331
I can't help thinking that...
Nothing. Just a bad joke.

150
00:10:08,699 --> 00:10:12,374
- She seems like a lovely girl.
- Yeah, she is. My family adores her.

151
00:10:12,703 --> 00:10:16,855
My mom thinks Crystal's the best thing
that ever happened to me.

152
00:10:17,207 --> 00:10:20,836
- Crystal?
- Did I saythat? I meant Mary Ann.

153
00:10:21,169 --> 00:10:25,481
I must have been admiring that crystal.
That's why I called her Crystal.

154
00:10:25,841 --> 00:10:29,117
It's a good thing
you weren't admiring the pork butt.

155
00:10:29,469 --> 00:10:31,903
I'm so nervous
I don't know what I'm saying.

156
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:34,250
I guess it's pre-wedding jitters.

157
00:10:34,516 --> 00:10:38,953
Nikos, go check on the sous-chef,
make sure he isn't into the ouzo.

158
00:10:39,313 --> 00:10:42,749
Last time he drank on duty he got
his head caught in the duck press.

159
00:10:43,066 --> 00:10:45,785
- How did he manage that?
- With my help.

160
00:10:47,529 --> 00:10:51,363
So, what were
you and Nikos talking about?

161
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:55,375
Don't you worry. I made you
a promise and I'd die before I break it.

162
00:10:55,704 --> 00:10:59,253
Or soon after.
So, you met Mary Ann?

163
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:01,574
Yes. You must be very proud.

164
00:11:01,835 --> 00:11:05,305
And relieved. That son of mine
was going steady with a juggler.

165
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:07,223
Crystal somebody.

166
00:11:07,466 --> 00:11:10,981
Imagine having a daughter-in-law
who throws things for a living.

167
00:11:11,303 --> 00:11:13,453
It's embarrassing.

168
00:11:14,973 --> 00:11:17,646
Come, people. Let's celebrate tonight.

169
00:11:20,729 --> 00:11:23,163
Thanks for settling everything
with Zora.

170
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,759
It's my pleasure.

171
00:11:24,983 --> 00:11:28,339
I can't find Walt.
I've been waiting five years for this.

172
00:11:28,654 --> 00:11:32,124
Did you know Nikos and Mary Ann
have only known each...

173
00:11:32,449 --> 00:11:35,600
- There he is!
- You must have so much to talk about.

174
00:11:35,911 --> 00:11:38,106
- Uncle Walt, hello.
- Frasier.

175
00:11:43,126 --> 00:11:45,640
- Marty.
- Walt.

176
00:11:46,838 --> 00:11:49,671
- What's new?
- Same old, same old.

177
00:11:52,219 --> 00:11:55,370
- How's tricks?
- Can't complain.

178
00:11:56,431 --> 00:11:59,628
- They keeping you busy?
- You better believe it.

179
00:12:00,435 --> 00:12:05,065
- What are you gonna do?
- Tell me about it.

180
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,319
It's amazing how you two
can pick up right where you left off.

181
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:28,422
Put those back.

182
00:12:29,298 --> 00:12:31,937
Niles, do you realise
how pathetic this is?

183
00:12:32,217 --> 00:12:35,448
At dinner Zora announced
that I'd filed for divorce.

184
00:12:35,762 --> 00:12:40,358
Within seconds Yvonne began purring
so loudly my allergies kicked in.

185
00:12:40,726 --> 00:12:43,035
I won't be safe
till this wedding is over.

186
00:12:43,312 --> 00:12:46,224
A wedding I think
might be a serious mistake.

187
00:12:46,523 --> 00:12:48,593
Does this mean you're going to meddle

188
00:12:48,859 --> 00:12:52,613
- and get us both thrown out?
- I can't. I promised I wouldn't.

189
00:12:52,946 --> 00:12:55,506
- Here she comes again.
- Have you seen Niles?

190
00:12:55,782 --> 00:12:57,056
No, I haven't.

191
00:12:57,659 --> 00:13:00,127
- Here we go.
- How much longer do we have to stay?

192
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:03,290
- What are you in a snit about?
- Thanks to Zora,

193
00:13:03,582 --> 00:13:06,654
they're sniggering about
me being your physical therapist.

194
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,394
She's always been a pain.

195
00:13:09,671 --> 00:13:12,981
You're telling me.
Dried up old grape leaf.

196
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,768
And she's one to talk
about reputations, too.

197
00:13:16,053 --> 00:13:18,089
Before she married my brother,

198
00:13:18,347 --> 00:13:21,259
she was easier to make
than a peanut butter sandwich.

199
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:25,301
Does everyone know that?

200
00:13:25,562 --> 00:13:28,440
Everybody except my brother.
I love him dearly,

201
00:13:28,732 --> 00:13:33,044
but he's not exactly the brightest bulb
in the...

202
00:13:33,403 --> 00:13:35,997
- Bulb box?
- Yeah.

203
00:13:36,281 --> 00:13:39,318
Here's Eddie.
Hey, Eddie. Where's the camera?

204
00:13:39,618 --> 00:13:41,609
Then it worked. It's right here.

205
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:50,045
I decided to go undercover. I wanted
to get people just being themselves.

206
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:55,414
We were really boring. Why
don't you rewind it and tape over it?

207
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:59,430
Funny. Mrs Pappas said the same thing.

208
00:13:59,763 --> 00:14:02,402
So why did you and Crystal break up?

209
00:14:02,683 --> 00:14:05,959
I'm not meddling. I'm just curious.
Just interested.

210
00:14:06,269 --> 00:14:08,829
It was a career conflict.
She's a juggler, too.

211
00:14:09,106 --> 00:14:12,178
You may have heard of her.
Crystal Baker?

212
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:17,683
No, I don't get to street theatre
as often as I should.

213
00:14:18,073 --> 00:14:21,622
Fabulous performer.
Fabulous girl, for that matter.

214
00:14:21,952 --> 00:14:24,864
But she wanted to work in Paris
and I wanted to stay here.

215
00:14:25,163 --> 00:14:27,882
There's always pressure
on a two-career family.

216
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:31,238
We had a big fight about it.
Then Mary Ann came along.

217
00:14:31,545 --> 00:14:35,424
By the time Crystal got back,
I was engaged.

218
00:14:35,757 --> 00:14:39,716
- And how did she take the news?
- She was crushed.

219
00:14:40,053 --> 00:14:43,443
But she's been wonderful.
She called me to congratulate me.

220
00:14:43,765 --> 00:14:47,963
We talked for hours,
just like old times. She's a sweetheart.

221
00:14:48,312 --> 00:14:50,303
She's starting to sound like one.

222
00:14:50,564 --> 00:14:56,275
It was really great talking with her.
I felt happy, purely happy.

223
00:14:56,695 --> 00:14:59,050
It might be the last time I did.

224
00:14:59,323 --> 00:15:02,872
Since then it's been the usual
pre-wedding stuff. The jitters,

225
00:15:03,201 --> 00:15:05,192
night sweats, vomiting...

226
00:15:07,414 --> 00:15:11,248
I promised your mother I would
never again interfere in your life.

227
00:15:11,585 --> 00:15:14,657
Interfere? You saved me
from making a terrible mistake.

228
00:15:14,963 --> 00:15:18,353
I value your advice above anything.

229
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:23,457
All right. In the interest
ofyour future happiness,

230
00:15:23,764 --> 00:15:25,755
it's my duty to let you know...

231
00:15:26,016 --> 00:15:31,044
Nikos, please go make your Uncle Stavros
to stop dancing on the table.

232
00:15:31,438 --> 00:15:34,236
It would be nice
to have a family gathering

233
00:15:34,524 --> 00:15:38,119
where no one leaves in an ambulance.
Am I right?

234
00:15:41,031 --> 00:15:43,147
Yes, wouldn't it?

235
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:51,136
Eddie, come on, you've been working
ever since I've been here.

236
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:55,736
- You haven't had chance to chow down.
- I wouldn't mind grabbing a bite.

237
00:15:56,088 --> 00:16:00,161
- Hand me that thing then.
- Be careful. That tape is historic.

238
00:16:00,509 --> 00:16:02,943
I've interviewed
every member ofthe family.

239
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:06,735
I even taped Nikos' great-grandmother.

240
00:16:07,057 --> 00:16:09,890
- 101 years old.
- That's amazing.

241
00:16:13,188 --> 00:16:16,783
101. Gosh, that's older than a century.

242
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:20,658
She probably has got more stories
than anybody else has.

243
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:25,701
- I can't do this.
- Press this button right here.

244
00:16:26,034 --> 00:16:27,023
Thanks.

245
00:16:29,371 --> 00:16:30,360
Bye.

246
00:16:32,624 --> 00:16:36,902
OK, everybody, gather round.
We're going to have some toasts here.

247
00:16:37,254 --> 00:16:40,769
So if everybody will stop
for one minute and...

248
00:16:41,091 --> 00:16:43,810
Why don't you
just hide in the men's room?

249
00:16:44,094 --> 00:16:46,449
Where do you thinkYvonne is right now?

250
00:16:47,764 --> 00:16:49,117
Where have you been?

251
00:16:49,349 --> 00:16:52,625
I've been trying
to contact Nikos' ex-girlfriend.

252
00:16:52,936 --> 00:16:55,325
The depths you'll sink to to get a date.

253
00:16:56,690 --> 00:17:00,524
I am convinced that he is still
in love with her. And she with him.

254
00:17:00,861 --> 00:17:03,659
If I could get them together
he might realise it in time.

255
00:17:03,947 --> 00:17:08,384
Alas, I couldn't reach her. Had
to leave a message with her roommate.

256
00:17:08,744 --> 00:17:10,939
Perhaps the time has come for you to...

257
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:17,135
...stop playing games
and start being direct.

258
00:17:17,419 --> 00:17:20,411
Frasier? Where's Frasier Crane?

259
00:17:20,797 --> 00:17:22,867
Oh, dear God.

260
00:17:23,133 --> 00:17:28,605
There you are. Come up here
and make a toast to the happy couple.

261
00:17:29,014 --> 00:17:32,086
I guess a thought or two comes to mind.

262
00:17:35,479 --> 00:17:38,596
I've known Nikos

263
00:17:40,275 --> 00:17:43,984
all of his life
and I'm sure that he realises

264
00:17:44,321 --> 00:17:48,030
marriage is a binding commitment,
not to be entered into hastily.

265
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:52,280
But when the right one comes along,
you know it.

266
00:17:52,621 --> 00:17:58,173
And it's very important to find the
person that you're most compatible with.

267
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:04,247
The one who makes you feel
"happy, purely happy".

268
00:18:04,633 --> 00:18:07,943
More important, makes me feel happy.

269
00:18:08,261 --> 00:18:12,698
It would be a shame to go through life
having to say, "lf I'd only waited".

270
00:18:13,058 --> 00:18:15,652
What the hell
kind oftoast is this anyway?

271
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:21,741
I want to make sure that my cousin
marries the woman he truly loves.

272
00:18:22,109 --> 00:18:25,146
Well said. Cheers, everybody.

273
00:18:26,154 --> 00:18:27,303
Thank you, Frasier.

274
00:18:27,531 --> 00:18:32,366
If I may say a word or two. My son Nikos
and I have had our ups and downs.

275
00:18:32,744 --> 00:18:35,656
But tonight at this moment
I can honestly say...

276
00:18:35,956 --> 00:18:39,153
What the hell are you doing here?

277
00:18:39,459 --> 00:18:40,778
Crystal.

278
00:18:41,003 --> 00:18:41,992
Nikos.

279
00:18:44,298 --> 00:18:48,894
I couldn't let you get married
without letting you know that l...

280
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:01,599
Nikos, what're you doing? Stop it.

281
00:19:01,898 --> 00:19:04,651
Her roommate
must have called her car phone.

282
00:19:04,943 --> 00:19:06,934
Jugglers have car phones?

283
00:19:08,488 --> 00:19:12,163
Nikos, you are ruining everything.
You, shoo, shoo, shoo.

284
00:19:18,623 --> 00:19:19,612
Nikos.

285
00:19:21,376 --> 00:19:24,573
Sorry, but Crystal's
the one I'm meant to be with.

286
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:30,193
I will never forgive you for this.
See how happy you've made my parents?

287
00:19:34,264 --> 00:19:37,301
Frasier, he's lost his mind.
Talk to him.

288
00:19:37,601 --> 00:19:39,796
Remember my promise?
No more meddling.

289
00:19:40,062 --> 00:19:43,099
Excuse me, everyone.
This may not be appropriate,

290
00:19:43,398 --> 00:19:47,027
but I have a toast too, to the man
who reunited me with the woman

291
00:19:47,361 --> 00:19:50,353
- I plan to spend my life with.
- No, no, inappropriate.

292
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:53,966
- Toast time is over.
- We want to offer you our thanks.

293
00:19:54,284 --> 00:19:57,879
You know what? Later on
why don't we do some bouzouki dancing?

294
00:20:03,627 --> 00:20:05,618
Why are they thanking you?

295
00:20:06,713 --> 00:20:08,749
We owe our happiness to him.

296
00:20:09,424 --> 00:20:11,733
Why couldn't she have been a mime?

297
00:20:14,054 --> 00:20:17,330
Once again he saved me
from making a terrible mistake.

298
00:20:17,641 --> 00:20:21,395
So, everyone, please lift your glasses
