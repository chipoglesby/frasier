1
00:00:16,898 --> 00:00:20,174
Ispecifically requested
my macaroni and cheese al dente.

2
00:00:20,485 --> 00:00:23,716
I know.
This lunch is a culinary Hindenberg.

3
00:00:24,031 --> 00:00:29,947
Niles, our food may be payback for your
recent editorial, Cafeteria of Shame.

4
00:00:31,163 --> 00:00:34,758
They can't intimidate me.
They'll never silence my pen.

5
00:00:35,083 --> 00:00:37,961
I could write an exposé
on their baked goods alone.

6
00:00:38,253 --> 00:00:41,848
Yes, this is the hardest roll
since Hamlet.

7
00:00:42,174 --> 00:00:45,132
- Good one, Frasier. May I use it?
- But of course.

8
00:00:45,427 --> 00:00:47,702
These biscotti
represent an all-time low.

9
00:00:47,971 --> 00:00:52,249
Chalky aftertaste,
inelegant aroma, spongy.

10
00:00:52,601 --> 00:00:56,674
Spongy biscotti is an unwelcome
trespasser into madeleine territory.

11
00:00:58,065 --> 00:01:00,818
These pistachios
are like swallowing gravel.

12
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:03,339
It's a wonder I've escaped injury.

13
00:01:03,612 --> 00:01:07,890
Your ability to cheat death
at every turn never ceases to amaze.

14
00:01:08,784 --> 00:01:11,139
- Someone's in a mood.
- I'm sorry.

15
00:01:11,411 --> 00:01:13,879
You know how you
find yourself getting restless?

16
00:01:14,164 --> 00:01:16,120
I have a feeling I'm about to.

17
00:01:19,753 --> 00:01:21,471
Hello? Yes.

18
00:01:21,713 --> 00:01:22,782
Really?

19
00:01:23,006 --> 00:01:25,679
Bravo. Eccellente. Benissimo.

20
00:01:27,427 --> 00:01:30,897
- You'll never guess who that was.
- The Three Tenors?

21
00:01:32,683 --> 00:01:34,833
No, that was my antique scout.

22
00:01:35,102 --> 00:01:37,662
The present for
Maris' birthday has arrived.

23
00:01:37,938 --> 00:01:40,736
I got her
the most exquisite antique saddle.

24
00:01:41,024 --> 00:01:43,584
How does it look on you?

25
00:01:49,324 --> 00:01:51,315
You won't laugh when you see it.

26
00:01:51,576 --> 00:01:54,215
It is bejewelled,
but not overdone, like Maris.

27
00:01:54,496 --> 00:01:58,250
The craftsmanship is breathtaking.
It's been so expertly restored,

28
00:01:58,583 --> 00:02:01,700
- you can barely see the stitching.
- Again, like Maris.

29
00:02:03,296 --> 00:02:06,174
Someone is in a mood today.
I'll get this.

30
00:02:06,466 --> 00:02:10,061
Thank you. You'd better go
to the wine club on your own tonight.

31
00:02:10,387 --> 00:02:11,706
What?

32
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:16,162
It'll just be the same old faces
rehashing the same boring topics.

33
00:02:16,518 --> 00:02:19,157
You are upset.
Let's get your mind off it.

34
00:02:19,438 --> 00:02:20,837
Dinner? Chamber music?

35
00:02:21,148 --> 00:02:25,585
There's a wonderful lecture series on
the history of modern lecture series.

36
00:02:25,944 --> 00:02:29,300
I don't think so.
I feel like being on my own tonight.

37
00:02:29,614 --> 00:02:31,889
- You don't mind, do you?
- Of course not.

38
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:35,708
- I'll see you at Cucina tomorrow.
- We'd better play that by ear.

39
00:02:36,038 --> 00:02:38,268
- As you wish.
- Are you upset?

40
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,531
I'd have to have a fragile ego

41
00:02:40,792 --> 00:02:43,147
to be upset because you
want time away from me.

42
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:45,490
Separate checks, please.

43
00:02:48,925 --> 00:02:52,804
- Marty, we're getting hungry.
- It's coming.

44
00:02:53,138 --> 00:02:56,335
Here we go. Cold cuts, pizza rolls,

45
00:02:56,642 --> 00:02:59,679
devilled eggs, pork roll-ups.

46
00:02:59,978 --> 00:03:03,175
Yes, the ideal buffet for a group
of heavy-set men over 60.

47
00:03:05,275 --> 00:03:08,347
I assume
everyone's affairs are in order?

48
00:03:09,988 --> 00:03:12,456
We're about ready
to start our poker game.

49
00:03:12,741 --> 00:03:16,097
- I'll be on my way in a minute.
- OK.

50
00:03:17,871 --> 00:03:20,943
- We're about ready to start...
- I heard you, Dad.

51
00:03:21,249 --> 00:03:23,888
I'm trying to figure out
what to do with myself.

52
00:03:24,169 --> 00:03:27,559
Lately my old routine
doesn't seem to satisfy me anymore.

53
00:03:27,881 --> 00:03:31,556
Maybe I could join you and the guys
for some cards?

54
00:03:31,885 --> 00:03:35,764
- I just don't think you'd fit in.
- Roz is playing.

55
00:03:36,098 --> 00:03:39,215
Roz is one ofthe guys.
She knows more dirty jokes than Duke.

56
00:03:39,518 --> 00:03:42,988
I could tell you a tale
that'd make you blush like a schoolgirl.

57
00:03:43,313 --> 00:03:47,864
- That's what I'm afraid of.
- Let him play. It can't hurt anything.

58
00:03:48,235 --> 00:03:51,352
- All right.
- Thanks, Dad. Let me get that for you.

59
00:03:51,655 --> 00:03:54,692
Guys, Frasier's
going to sit in with us tonight.

60
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:59,891
- You're going to play with us?
- Don't look so surprised.

61
00:04:00,205 --> 00:04:03,322
Sometimes
I enjoy a night with the guys.

62
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:05,741
OK, seven-card stud, high-low,

63
00:04:06,003 --> 00:04:08,995
- chips to win, the wheel is no good.
- Perfect.

64
00:04:09,297 --> 00:04:11,936
- Three bump limit.
- Sounds good.

65
00:04:12,217 --> 00:04:15,414
- You're lost, aren't you?
- Like a Bedouin in a sandstorm.

66
00:04:16,888 --> 00:04:19,083
You guys get your all-weather tyres
on yet?

67
00:04:19,349 --> 00:04:22,227
I'm going to Richie's.
I'll let him do it.

68
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:25,795
- At Tim's you get free Armor All.
- You ever been to Hank's?

69
00:04:26,106 --> 00:04:29,303
Yeah, I've been to Hank's.
Right next to Mike's Hardware.

70
00:04:29,609 --> 00:04:32,362
At Mike's
they got those cordless drills.

71
00:04:32,654 --> 00:04:37,409
You ought to try Tommy's. Free
battery testers with every purchase.

72
00:04:37,784 --> 00:04:38,773
I'm out.

73
00:04:39,745 --> 00:04:41,736
Thanks for the money.

74
00:04:41,997 --> 00:04:45,069
- That was a bust.
- Be glad you got out before the debate

75
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:47,764
over who'd be more fun
on a desert island,

76
00:04:48,045 --> 00:04:50,923
Angie Dickinson or Ursula Andress.

77
00:04:51,465 --> 00:04:53,774
That is ludicrous. It's Angie Dickinson.

78
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:58,024
Dr Crane,
I know it's none of my business,

79
00:04:58,305 --> 00:05:00,421
but... Never mind.

80
00:05:00,682 --> 00:05:02,673
No, go ahead.

81
00:05:03,268 --> 00:05:07,056
Perhaps you're restless because
of a lack of female companionship.

82
00:05:07,397 --> 00:05:09,388
- So I thought...
- Oh, dear.

83
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:14,565
I'm meeting my friend Clare for drinks
tonight and she's feeling restless also.

84
00:05:14,946 --> 00:05:18,734
Stop right there.
You know my policy on fix-ups.

85
00:05:19,076 --> 00:05:21,544
She's pretty, lonely,
and an underwear model.

86
00:05:21,828 --> 00:05:23,819
You do know my policy. Offwe go.

87
00:05:33,173 --> 00:05:35,209
Say hello to the Fox and Whistle.

88
00:05:35,467 --> 00:05:37,458
You point her out, and I will.

89
00:05:38,679 --> 00:05:41,432
- Give us a kiss.
- I hope he's talking to you.

90
00:05:41,723 --> 00:05:44,078
- Evening, all.
- Daphne!

91
00:05:45,185 --> 00:05:48,382
- There's Clare now.
- She's everything you said she was.

92
00:05:48,689 --> 00:05:50,884
- I'm engaged.
- And more.

93
00:05:51,525 --> 00:05:55,359
- When did this happen?
- My old boyfriend Bob surprised me.

94
00:05:55,821 --> 00:05:59,894
You've got to meet him. He brought
someone you might be interested in.

95
00:06:00,242 --> 00:06:02,802
He is nice looking, isn't he?

96
00:06:04,413 --> 00:06:06,404
Coming, Pookey.

97
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:10,541
It seems I've dragged you
down here for nothing.

98
00:06:10,836 --> 00:06:14,272
I would've missed seeing
the world's most nauseating couple

99
00:06:14,589 --> 00:06:16,580
defend their title.

100
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,388
- We can leave ifyou like.
- No, you go talk with your friend.

101
00:06:21,722 --> 00:06:23,917
- I'll have a drink.
- What do you need?

102
00:06:24,182 --> 00:06:26,491
I've been asking myselfthat all day.

103
00:06:26,768 --> 00:06:29,407
- Seems that lately my life...
- I'll come back.

104
00:06:33,066 --> 00:06:35,057
I forgot that story.

105
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:40,154
It doesn't top the time Leo and I broke
up that fight in the strip joint.

106
00:06:40,532 --> 00:06:43,604
We walked in there
and there was this one girl who...

107
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:46,982
Marty, maybe you shouldn't tell
that particular story.

108
00:06:47,289 --> 00:06:50,122
- Because of Roz?
- If I can handle

109
00:06:50,417 --> 00:06:53,056
the Angie-Ursula debate,
I can handle this.

110
00:06:53,337 --> 00:06:57,376
You agreed with me, right?
You said you'd rather sleep with Angie.

111
00:06:58,216 --> 00:07:01,606
One more time, Leo.
If I had to choose.

112
00:07:05,432 --> 00:07:08,026
You start telling them
that strip-joint story.

113
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:12,508
You guys will bust a gut.
Anybody else need a beer? Roz?

114
00:07:13,565 --> 00:07:15,954
- Remember?
- I'm sorry. I forgot. Yeah.

115
00:07:16,234 --> 00:07:19,988
Afraid you won't control yourself
with all these handsome guys?

116
00:07:20,322 --> 00:07:22,916
Too late for that, Frank.
I'm pregnant.

117
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,509
What, really? That's great.

118
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:28,194
I remember when Annie was pregnant.

119
00:07:28,455 --> 00:07:32,243
There is nothing more beautiful
than a pregnant broad.

120
00:07:34,503 --> 00:07:37,859
Best thing I ever did was having kids.

121
00:07:38,173 --> 00:07:41,370
From the moment you hold
that brand-new baby in your arms,

122
00:07:41,677 --> 00:07:44,510
- your life changes.
- You're right about that.

123
00:07:44,805 --> 00:07:48,923
What about when they grab your finger?
That's the greatest feeling.

124
00:07:49,267 --> 00:07:52,498
The joy of seeing them
look up at you and smile.

125
00:07:52,813 --> 00:07:56,328
- Cherish every moment, Roz.
- One minute they're on your lap.

126
00:07:56,650 --> 00:08:00,404
Next thing they're out the door
with lives of their own.

127
00:08:00,737 --> 00:08:05,288
And it's just you,
old and alone in an empty house.

128
00:08:06,159 --> 00:08:08,150
So empty.

129
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:18,486
Leo, I don't think
you told that story right.

130
00:08:20,257 --> 00:08:24,045
- I think Steven likes you.
- I hope so. He's adorable.

131
00:08:24,386 --> 00:08:27,503
I was flattered he assumed
I was an underwear model, too.

132
00:08:27,806 --> 00:08:29,876
You didn't rush to correct him.

133
00:08:30,142 --> 00:08:32,940
There'll be time for that
after the wedding.

134
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:36,443
Maybe I should just tell
Dr Crane to go home.

135
00:08:36,732 --> 00:08:40,725
I'm surprised you broughtyour boss.
I could never relax around mine.

136
00:08:41,069 --> 00:08:44,744
- What if he likes the place?
- That's nothing I have to worry about.

137
00:08:45,073 --> 00:08:47,143
This pub really isn't his style.

138
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:06,712
Daphne, sing a song with us.
You're not shy singing around the house.

139
00:09:07,054 --> 00:09:08,567
You live together?

140
00:09:08,805 --> 00:09:12,320
- She's my dad's healthcare worker.
- You don't model underwear?

141
00:09:12,643 --> 00:09:16,636
Only if her robe's
not cinched up tight enough.

142
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:20,177
Come on, Frasier, we're going to do
Knees Up, MotherBrown.

143
00:09:20,484 --> 00:09:23,999
I don't know that. I know.
Let's bring sheet music tomorrow night.

144
00:09:24,321 --> 00:09:28,951
Tomorrow? You can't. I mean, do you know
you have that gallery opening tomorrow?

145
00:09:29,326 --> 00:09:32,602
No, but ifyou hum a few bars,
I'll try to pick it up.

146
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:45,088
Sherry,
Daphne's clearing out for a night.

147
00:09:45,384 --> 00:09:49,343
Why don't you come over?
I'll get a fire going,

148
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,992
open up a bottle of bubbly,
put a little Bobby Darin on the stereo,

149
00:09:55,227 --> 00:09:58,617
and then
"Look out, Macky's back in town".

150
00:10:01,274 --> 00:10:04,903
I thought it up before I called you.
What's the difference?

151
00:10:05,237 --> 00:10:06,716
OK, see you soon.

152
00:10:08,198 --> 00:10:10,189
Don't you look beautiful.

153
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:15,240
Thank you. It's so nice to have
my pub back again. At least for a night.

154
00:10:15,622 --> 00:10:19,979
- You are sure Dr Crane has plans?
- He and Niles are going to the opera.

155
00:10:20,335 --> 00:10:24,487
Let's hope it's a long German one. I
don't want him showing up for last call.

156
00:10:26,091 --> 00:10:28,446
Good evening, Daphne.
You look smashing.

157
00:10:28,719 --> 00:10:32,553
- I was just on my way out.
- To the Fox and Whistle? I'll come.

158
00:10:32,889 --> 00:10:35,687
Let me just get me brolly
and Bob's your uncle.

159
00:10:35,976 --> 00:10:38,774
I thought you were
going to the opera.

160
00:10:39,062 --> 00:10:43,692
That's tomorrow night. I hope Winston's
at the pub. I owe him five quid.

161
00:10:44,067 --> 00:10:48,743
- I'm not feeling so well.
- Hope it's not flu.

162
00:10:49,114 --> 00:10:51,867
- I think I'll stay home.
- That's for the best.

163
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:54,719
Got to be careful what
you bring down to the pub.

164
00:10:54,995 --> 00:10:56,872
Tell me about it.

165
00:10:57,414 --> 00:10:59,405
- Hello, Niles.
- Frasier.

166
00:11:00,417 --> 00:11:03,568
- Is something the matter?
- Had a rough night last night.

167
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:05,551
How so?

168
00:11:05,797 --> 00:11:07,788
I gave Maris her birthday saddle.

169
00:11:09,593 --> 00:11:13,666
She was so thrilled she treated me
to a little Lady Godiva impression.

170
00:11:14,014 --> 00:11:19,805
Apparently the oils in the saddle
reacted badly with her cellulite cream.

171
00:11:20,228 --> 00:11:22,537
It created a powerful epoxy.

172
00:11:24,608 --> 00:11:26,166
Oh, dear.

173
00:11:26,401 --> 00:11:31,350
It took an hour and a full bottle of
nail polish remover to get her free.

174
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,731
Today her thighs were so raw

175
00:11:33,992 --> 00:11:38,782
the only way she could find comfort was
to straddle a frozen Butterball turkey.

176
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:47,040
The only thing that cheered me up
was the thought of the opera tonight.

177
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:49,948
- That's tomorrow.
- No, it's tonight.

178
00:11:50,217 --> 00:11:52,970
- I have the tickets right here.
- Oh, no.

179
00:11:53,762 --> 00:11:55,753
Is there a problem?

180
00:11:56,014 --> 00:11:59,324
Yes. There's a billiard tournament
at the pub tonight.

181
00:11:59,643 --> 00:12:02,396
You're passing up
Orpheus and Eurydiceto shoot pool

182
00:12:02,688 --> 00:12:04,679
at a sticky-floored saloon?

183
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:10,378
My partner Terrence is skipping
a family wedding just to participate.

184
00:12:10,779 --> 00:12:15,375
- Can't somebody take my place?
- I'd just as soon be by myself.

185
00:12:15,742 --> 00:12:18,620
My brother has abandoned me.
My wife is cursing me.

186
00:12:18,912 --> 00:12:23,986
When Orpheus descends into hell, I'll
be waiting for him with a fruit basket.

187
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:27,846
You can't stay mad at me. I'll
make it up to you. Press for the lift.

188
00:12:28,171 --> 00:12:31,163
Don't look at me that way.
That's what they call it.

189
00:12:49,568 --> 00:12:50,557
Ah, baby...

190
00:12:59,328 --> 00:13:01,717
Why is it so bloody dark in here?

191
00:13:01,997 --> 00:13:05,034
Bad enough I have to stay home,
I'm not going blind as well.

192
00:13:05,334 --> 00:13:07,325
You're staying in?

193
00:13:07,586 --> 00:13:10,976
No choice since your son
decided to go to my pub again.

194
00:13:11,298 --> 00:13:15,086
Imagine being so dense that
you can ruin someone else's evening

195
00:13:15,427 --> 00:13:18,783
and not even be aware of it.
This wax is dripping.

196
00:13:22,142 --> 00:13:25,373
Have you tried maybe dropping a hint?

197
00:13:25,687 --> 00:13:29,600
Believe me, I've dropped plenty.
They go right over his head.

198
00:13:29,941 --> 00:13:31,932
I'll have a glass ofthat.

199
00:13:32,944 --> 00:13:34,935
I've got to level with you.

200
00:13:35,197 --> 00:13:39,236
Sherry's coming over and
I'd hoped to have the place to myself.

201
00:13:39,576 --> 00:13:41,692
You ought to talk to Frasier,

202
00:13:41,953 --> 00:13:45,104
and I'm not saying this
to get you out of here.

203
00:13:45,415 --> 00:13:49,886
- Tell him to go find his own place.
- I can't say that.

204
00:13:50,253 --> 00:13:53,484
The longer you let it go,
the more attached he's going to get.

205
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:56,632
- But he's my boss.
- But it's your pub.

206
00:13:58,595 --> 00:14:02,668
OK. That's it.
I'm going to go talk to him.

207
00:14:03,016 --> 00:14:04,005
Good for you.

208
00:14:07,896 --> 00:14:08,885
Hello?

209
00:14:10,315 --> 00:14:12,431
No, Maris,
sorry, you just missed him.

210
00:14:13,193 --> 00:14:15,184
Why are your teeth chattering?

211
00:14:20,283 --> 00:14:23,753
You're kidding me.
Can't you just use the defroster?

212
00:14:28,709 --> 00:14:34,022
I never dreamed we'd be eliminated
from the tournament in the first round.

213
00:14:34,881 --> 00:14:37,441
Guess I was a little rustier
than I thought.

214
00:14:37,718 --> 00:14:41,677
- Maybe you can still make that wedding.
- It's in Liverpool.

215
00:14:43,181 --> 00:14:45,172
Well, then, these are on me.

216
00:14:46,518 --> 00:14:48,907
Hey, it's Daphne. Hello, love.

217
00:14:49,187 --> 00:14:51,985
Evening, all.
Dr Crane, I have to talk to you.

218
00:14:52,274 --> 00:14:54,265
By all means, Daphne.

219
00:14:54,526 --> 00:14:58,360
Winston, let's have one of these pints
for Miss Moon, please.

220
00:14:59,281 --> 00:15:02,239
This is a nice surprise.
You must be feeling better.

221
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:04,889
Here we are. You make a toast.

222
00:15:05,162 --> 00:15:07,915
I don't want you
coming down here ever again.

223
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:13,621
I guess "Here's mud in your eye"
sounded mean the first time, too.

224
00:15:15,464 --> 00:15:18,934
I'm sorry if that sounds harsh
but I don't know what else to do.

225
00:15:19,259 --> 00:15:22,774
This is where I come to get away
from things, including my job,

226
00:15:23,096 --> 00:15:26,725
- and you are my boss.
- Daphne, I am so sorry.

227
00:15:27,643 --> 00:15:30,476
- I know that must sound selfish.
- No, not at all.

228
00:15:30,771 --> 00:15:34,446
You know, back in Boston
I had a bar like this one.

229
00:15:34,775 --> 00:15:38,893
I certainly understand what it's like
to have a place where you can get away.

230
00:15:40,238 --> 00:15:45,676
So, we've just got one solution.
This is your bar. I'll just go.

231
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,954
I do appreciate this, Dr Crane.
I know you've made friends here, too.

232
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:53,805
But you've got a history here.

233
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:56,520
They've become like family to me.

234
00:15:56,797 --> 00:15:58,549
I'll just settle up and go.

235
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:00,198
Hey, stranger.

236
00:16:00,425 --> 00:16:03,223
I've not been gone that long.
Two months is all.

237
00:16:03,512 --> 00:16:06,231
- Who's this new girl?
- Daphne, Clare's friend.

238
00:16:06,515 --> 00:16:08,745
- Been coming in the last month.
- A month?

239
00:16:09,017 --> 00:16:11,485
Hello. I'll see you at home, Dr Crane.

240
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:15,206
- You've only been coming here a month?
- That's longer than you.

241
00:16:15,524 --> 00:16:18,914
There's no way I'm leaving now.
This bar has filled a void.

242
00:16:19,236 --> 00:16:22,990
I won't throw that away
because you beat me here by a fortnight.

243
00:16:23,323 --> 00:16:25,996
Stop talking like us.

244
00:16:26,284 --> 00:16:28,752
I don't know what you're arguing about

245
00:16:29,037 --> 00:16:32,234
but we settle things round here
with a quick game of cricket.

246
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:34,850
- Darts?
- Yeah, rules are on the board.

247
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:38,961
- There's got to be a better way.
- Well, I don't know. It's decisive.

248
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:41,528
It's better than bickering.

249
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,837
- It's not exactly my game.
- It's not mine either.

250
00:16:46,388 --> 00:16:49,460
- All right, let's try it.
- You shoot first, Daphne.

251
00:16:50,892 --> 00:16:53,486
I'm proud of us.
Two people with a conflict.

252
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:56,204
We found a civilised way to settle it.

253
00:16:58,191 --> 00:16:59,260
Oh, my.

254
00:16:59,484 --> 00:17:01,440
- Is that good?
- Quite good.

255
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:03,492
Lucky shot, then.

256
00:17:07,284 --> 00:17:10,754
If I didn't know better,
I'd think you were trying to hustle me.

257
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:14,788
Not at all. I may have played
a game or two offeathers in my day.

258
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:18,754
A game or two? You made the most
difficult shot on the entire board.

259
00:17:19,755 --> 00:17:22,906
Actually, that's only
the second most difficult.

260
00:17:23,216 --> 00:17:25,286
That's the most difficult.

261
00:17:25,552 --> 00:17:30,307
Come to think of it, there might have
been a dartboard in that bar in Boston.

262
00:17:33,018 --> 00:17:35,009
Look at that. It's all tied up.

263
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:38,148
Who would've guessed
those hands were so skilled?

264
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:41,557
Certainly no one who's sampled
your corned beef hash.

265
00:17:47,491 --> 00:17:49,482
I score again.

266
00:17:49,743 --> 00:17:53,497
That's not something we hear
out ofyour mouth very often.

267
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:02,870
You don't want to rush this one.

268
00:18:04,466 --> 00:18:08,095
- A lot riding on this.
- There's such a thing as sportsmanship.

269
00:18:08,428 --> 00:18:12,580
Really? This from a woman who made
armpit noises during my last round.

270
00:18:14,977 --> 00:18:16,251
Sod!

271
00:18:16,478 --> 00:18:21,836
I am sorry, Daphne. Now all I have to
do is make this relatively simple shot,

272
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:25,909
- unless you'd like to concede defeat.
- Typical American arrogance.

273
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:29,150
We Brits don't know
the meaning of the word defeat.

274
00:18:29,449 --> 00:18:33,806
Then you're not acquainted with a spat
called the Revolutionary War.

275
00:18:34,871 --> 00:18:37,101
Out of my way.

276
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:43,957
Just like a Yank. Insulting us Brits
to cover up your inferiority complex.

277
00:18:44,381 --> 00:18:46,451
What should we feel inferior about?

278
00:18:46,717 --> 00:18:49,914
Your pioneering work
in the field of soccer hooliganism?

279
00:18:52,639 --> 00:18:56,598
Say your worst. There isn't as much
dignity in this entire country

280
00:18:56,935 --> 00:19:00,086
- as our queen's got in her finger.
- You've bested me there.

281
00:19:00,397 --> 00:19:02,786
What's more dignified
than a dowdy sandbag

282
00:19:03,066 --> 00:19:05,057
with a flower pot on her head?

283
00:19:06,528 --> 00:19:09,361
I win. The bar is mine.

284
00:19:10,824 --> 00:19:13,622
Lose the long faces, lads.
I'm staying.

285
00:19:15,412 --> 00:19:19,007
I hope you didn't take those barbs
about the motherland seriously.

286
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:23,212
- Perhaps you'd better leave now.
- There's no greater Anglophile than l.

287
00:19:23,545 --> 00:19:26,343
No, really, I have
all my suits made at Savile Row.

288
00:19:26,632 --> 00:19:28,588
I spell "colour" with a "u".

289
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,294
Hello, Niles.

290
00:19:38,518 --> 00:19:41,828
Well, look who's here.
Take a wrong turn on the way to the pub?

291
00:19:43,899 --> 00:19:46,777
Actually, that scene has grown tiresome

292
00:19:47,944 --> 00:19:50,174
and I miss this place.

293
00:19:50,447 --> 00:19:54,042
I've spoken to Daphne.
I take it it's over "over there"?

294
00:19:58,538 --> 00:20:00,449
You don't have to rub it in.

295
00:20:00,707 --> 00:20:04,780
Anyway, I know I owe you an apology
from the other night, so, here.

296
00:20:06,546 --> 00:20:08,537
I brought you a peace offering.

297
00:20:09,841 --> 00:20:12,594
Orpheus and Eurydice.
Thank you, Frasier.

298
00:20:12,886 --> 00:20:16,242
The Glyndebourne production.
I don't have this one.

299
00:20:16,556 --> 00:20:20,071
The Chorus ofthe Furies is particularly
moving and Janet Baker...

300
00:20:20,394 --> 00:20:24,273
...is quite simply the best contralto
solo I've ever heard.

301
00:20:24,606 --> 00:20:29,634
Thank you, Frasier. I don't have
Orpheus and Eurydice on eight-track yet.

302
00:20:30,445 --> 00:20:34,723
But I'm surprised to see you.
No woodworking club today?

303
00:20:35,075 --> 00:20:38,988
To tell you the truth,
I've grown tired of that crowd

304
00:20:39,329 --> 00:20:42,685
with their stupid bookends
and birdhouses.

305
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,958
As soon as I shellac
my shoetrees, I'm out of there.

306
00:20:46,253 --> 00:20:48,289
- You got thrown out.
- I did not.

307
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:51,141
- I can see through you.
- Are you a psychiatrist?

308
00:20:51,425 --> 00:20:54,303
No, but I can see it in your face.
You got kicked out.

309
00:20:54,594 --> 00:20:58,303
Don't be ridiculous.
Why would they throw me out?
