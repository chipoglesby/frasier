1
00:00:13,545 --> 00:00:18,061
Tricia, I am so very sorry.
Have you been waiting long?

2
00:00:18,425 --> 00:00:22,623
We were supposed to meet at noon,
and it's now quarter to one.

3
00:00:22,971 --> 00:00:25,326
The most extraordinary thing happened.

4
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:28,750
At least I'll get
a colourful anecdote out ofthis.

5
00:00:29,061 --> 00:00:31,211
- My watch stopped.
- I've got to go.

6
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,153
That is extraordinary.
It's a Swiss timepiece.

7
00:00:34,441 --> 00:00:36,432
It only loses a minute per decade.

8
00:00:36,693 --> 00:00:41,448
And you've had it for what, 450 years?
I have an appointment at one.

9
00:00:41,823 --> 00:00:44,212
Please, let me have another chance.

10
00:00:44,493 --> 00:00:47,371
I'd love to get to know you better.

11
00:00:47,955 --> 00:00:50,867
I suppose even Swiss watches
sometimes stop.

12
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:54,556
You'd be amazed how much fondue
gets overcooked that way.

13
00:00:56,213 --> 00:00:59,444
How about lunch tomorrow
at Le Petit Bistro?

14
00:00:59,758 --> 00:01:02,795
He'll give us the best table
in the house. Please?

15
00:01:03,095 --> 00:01:05,973
OK. I'll meet you there at one.

16
00:01:06,265 --> 00:01:08,938
- That's when the little hand is...
- Yes, I know.

17
00:01:10,018 --> 00:01:12,009
- See you then.
- OK.

18
00:01:16,316 --> 00:01:18,307
Frasier. Thank God you have room.

19
00:01:18,569 --> 00:01:24,201
I just spent ten stupefying minutes
sharing a table with a taxidermist.

20
00:01:24,616 --> 00:01:28,370
He doesn't have to stuff his trophies.
He can just bore them stiff.

21
00:01:28,704 --> 00:01:30,501
Who was that woman?

22
00:01:30,747 --> 00:01:33,215
A young lady I met
at the opera last night.

23
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:38,449
It was remarkable.
Our hands touched, there was a spark.

24
00:01:38,839 --> 00:01:42,229
After ten minutes,
I knew I had to know her better.

25
00:01:42,551 --> 00:01:47,181
- Ever experience that sort of thing?
- I do know a thing or two about it.

26
00:01:47,556 --> 00:01:51,310
Excuse me. Can I have
the non-fat cappuccino, please?

27
00:01:51,643 --> 00:01:55,841
What am I to deduce,
that you've recently gotten lucky?

28
00:01:56,189 --> 00:02:00,546
Yes, and she lives in your building.
Five floors down. Allison Landis.

29
00:02:00,903 --> 00:02:04,213
You sneak. I don't even
know the woman. How did you two meet?

30
00:02:04,531 --> 00:02:08,763
On the elevator. I walked her to her
car where she'd locked her keys inside.

31
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,668
- I saved the day.
- You got them out with a coat hanger?

32
00:02:12,998 --> 00:02:17,116
I called the auto club.
Where would I find a coat hanger?

33
00:02:17,461 --> 00:02:20,339
She invited me for lunch,
we hit it off.

34
00:02:20,631 --> 00:02:23,748
The next night I took her to dinner.
One thing led to another

35
00:02:24,051 --> 00:02:26,963
and soon there was
no further need for words.

36
00:02:27,262 --> 00:02:30,459
Except for your frantically-babbled
"thank yous".

37
00:02:30,766 --> 00:02:34,554
I'm seeing her tonight, so you'll
understand if I'm drained tomorrow

38
00:02:34,895 --> 00:02:37,773
at our squash game.
My love-making can get athletic.

39
00:02:38,065 --> 00:02:40,863
More than can be said
for your squash game.

40
00:02:41,151 --> 00:02:43,711
I've been away
from the seduction scene so long

41
00:02:43,987 --> 00:02:46,421
I was worried I'd lost my technique.

42
00:02:46,698 --> 00:02:49,337
Were those fears ever groundless.

43
00:02:50,786 --> 00:02:54,142
It's like French.
You can go without speaking it for years

44
00:02:54,456 --> 00:02:57,892
and then a few hours
on the boulevard d'amour, then you...

45
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:01,407
- Where are you going?
- To sit with the taxidermist.

46
00:03:06,176 --> 00:03:08,644
I can't believe this has happened twice.

47
00:03:08,929 --> 00:03:12,842
- You had car trouble.
- Maybe she's still at Le Petit Bistro.

48
00:03:13,183 --> 00:03:16,459
She isn't. Ifyou're talking
about someone named Tricia,

49
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:20,683
she called to say she was leaving.
She said you were right about the table.

50
00:03:21,024 --> 00:03:25,336
Itwas a beautiful table and she wished
you were laid out dead on top of it.

51
00:03:29,366 --> 00:03:31,357
It's her machine.

52
00:03:32,202 --> 00:03:35,672
Hello, Tricia, it's Frasier.
I'm terribly sorry

53
00:03:35,998 --> 00:03:41,231
but my car battery went dead at a light
and I didn't have my cell phone.

54
00:03:41,628 --> 00:03:45,906
I couldn't go to the restaurant because
I was wearing ridiculous shorts.

55
00:03:46,258 --> 00:03:49,967
I know how this sounds but
it's the truth. Here, ask my brother.

56
00:03:50,304 --> 00:03:52,738
They're ridiculous shorts.

57
00:03:54,474 --> 00:03:57,147
Anyway, please give me one more chance.

58
00:03:57,436 --> 00:03:59,950
I'll go anywhere, anytime.

59
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:03,063
Just give me a call.

60
00:04:03,358 --> 00:04:04,427
Please.

61
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,351
May I have the phone?

62
00:04:07,613 --> 00:04:09,843
I had such
high hopes for this young woman.

63
00:04:10,115 --> 00:04:13,391
Now I've gone and blown it twice.
Whom are you calling?

64
00:04:13,702 --> 00:04:15,932
Allison. It's been hours since we spoke.

65
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:21,157
Hello, there.

66
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:25,161
How are you feeling?

67
00:04:25,631 --> 00:04:26,620
Me, too.

68
00:04:28,425 --> 00:04:30,017
Yeah, me too...

69
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:33,013
Take it in my bedroom.

70
00:04:34,765 --> 00:04:36,995
You're making the dog twitch.

71
00:04:37,267 --> 00:04:40,942
You'll be so excited when you hear
what I got planned foryour birthday.

72
00:04:41,271 --> 00:04:44,627
- I didn'twant anyfuss this year.
- Get ready to change your mind

73
00:04:44,942 --> 00:04:48,901
cos I scored tickets Friday night
to the best show in town.

74
00:04:49,947 --> 00:04:51,938
Chimps On Ice.

75
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,189
Oh, my.

76
00:04:54,409 --> 00:04:57,367
I know this doesn't sound
like your cup of tea,

77
00:04:57,663 --> 00:05:00,302
but Duke saw it last week
and he busted a gut.

78
00:05:00,582 --> 00:05:03,301
And mind you,
he even saw it with the understudy.

79
00:05:04,419 --> 00:05:09,254
Dad, I really don't feel like going out
on my birthday this year.

80
00:05:09,633 --> 00:05:11,988
- Are you sure?
- Actually, I'd made plans.

81
00:05:12,261 --> 00:05:16,254
I was going to watch television. There's
a new production of Cosi fan tutte.

82
00:05:16,598 --> 00:05:18,509
No wonder, then.

83
00:05:19,768 --> 00:05:22,282
You're missing a treat.
Duke said at the finale

84
00:05:22,563 --> 00:05:25,600
the cast skates to the top
of a ramp and then splat!

85
00:05:25,899 --> 00:05:30,131
Right into a tank ofwhipped cream.
Bet they don't do that at your opera.

86
00:05:30,487 --> 00:05:33,365
No, and Mozart's still kicking himself.

87
00:05:33,657 --> 00:05:34,646
Come on, boy.

88
00:05:37,619 --> 00:05:40,895
Frasier, are you familiar
with the Safari Club?

89
00:05:41,206 --> 00:05:44,482
Of course.
Their yearly expeditions are remarkable.

90
00:05:44,793 --> 00:05:48,945
They're legendary. Last year they made
camp at the base of Mount Everest,

91
00:05:49,298 --> 00:05:52,927
then had their servants climb it
while they held a wine-tasting.

92
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:56,696
- Why are you telling me this?
- Because Allison is a member.

93
00:05:57,014 --> 00:06:01,212
This Friday they're having a reception
at her place and we're invited.

94
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,551
That's incredible.

95
00:06:05,147 --> 00:06:08,184
- Consider it your birthday present.
- Thank you so much.

96
00:06:08,483 --> 00:06:10,439
I told Dad I was going to stay home.

97
00:06:10,694 --> 00:06:12,969
- Don't tell him about this.
- Don't worry.

98
00:06:13,238 --> 00:06:16,196
I told him yesterday
I was going away for the weekend.

99
00:06:16,491 --> 00:06:21,281
- You knew about this yesterday?
- No, but I knew about Chimps On Ice.

100
00:06:29,588 --> 00:06:33,820
I understand one of the members
is going to show an old film he made

101
00:06:34,176 --> 00:06:38,692
of the rare and endangered species
found only in the rainforest.

102
00:06:39,056 --> 00:06:41,411
- Maris would have loved it.
- Why so?

103
00:06:41,683 --> 00:06:44,641
She had shoes made
from almost all of them.

104
00:06:45,187 --> 00:06:49,180
- Allison.
- Niles. And this must be Frasier.

105
00:06:49,524 --> 00:06:53,119
Come in, both ofyou. There are
lots of people I'd like you to meet.

106
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:59,338
The bar is over there
and the hors d'oeuvres are here.

107
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:03,653
We have some fascinating delicacies
actually bagged by our own members.

108
00:07:03,997 --> 00:07:07,831
This is ostrich, that's wildebeest
and that's springbok.

109
00:07:08,168 --> 00:07:13,196
I can never remember, is it
"fall ahead, spring bok" or vice versa?

110
00:07:16,426 --> 00:07:20,055
- I forgot I had this on me.
- Don't apologise. I do it myself.

111
00:07:20,389 --> 00:07:24,302
Even in the veldt one must
keep in touch with one's broker.

112
00:07:24,643 --> 00:07:28,158
- You can have privacy in the study.
- Thank you. Hello?

113
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,755
You look ravishing tonight.

114
00:07:31,024 --> 00:07:35,415
Thank you. You and I should be
very discreet tonight.

115
00:07:35,779 --> 00:07:40,773
I'm a psychiatrist. If I can't be
discreet, it don't rain in Tanganyika.

116
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:43,150
After all, if in the near future,

117
00:07:43,412 --> 00:07:46,051
you should be
up for membership in our club,

118
00:07:46,331 --> 00:07:49,607
I want to appear objective
when I sing your praises.

119
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:52,352
My ears are already burning.

120
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,513
Frasier, we're being
considered for membership.

121
00:07:57,801 --> 00:08:00,679
We must show them
how enthusiastic we are.

122
00:08:00,971 --> 00:08:03,087
- I have to leave.
- What?

123
00:08:03,348 --> 00:08:08,103
That was Tricia on the phone. She's
going out of town tonight for a month.

124
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:11,675
But if I pick her up at her place,
we can at least have a drink.

125
00:08:11,982 --> 00:08:15,691
Are you insane? This is the Safari Club.

126
00:08:16,028 --> 00:08:20,067
These are the people who introduced
badminton to Devil's lsland.

127
00:08:22,242 --> 00:08:26,281
They challenged the lepers of Molokai
to a three-legged race.

128
00:08:26,622 --> 00:08:31,093
I don't care. It was kismet
when I met Tricia. I must see her.

129
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:34,816
To leave two minutes after arriving,
you'll ruin our chances.

130
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:38,008
All right.
I'll make a proper excuse.

131
00:08:38,634 --> 00:08:41,102
Excuse me, Allison.
I'm terribly sorry.

132
00:08:41,386 --> 00:08:45,015
It seems I'm coming down with something.
I'm going to have to leave.

133
00:08:45,349 --> 00:08:49,740
Ifyou feel better, please come back.
We'll be here all evening.

134
00:08:50,103 --> 00:08:54,858
Thank you, but I don't really
see that there's much hope.

135
00:08:56,818 --> 00:09:00,731
I'm just picking up my keys.
I will see you in ten minutes.

136
00:09:01,073 --> 00:09:03,541
And, Tricia, I can't wait.

137
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:05,751
All right, bye.

138
00:09:08,163 --> 00:09:10,154
Surprise!

139
00:09:18,632 --> 00:09:21,863
We weren't going to let you
stay home alone on your birthday.

140
00:09:22,177 --> 00:09:25,533
- Look at him. He can't believe it.
- No, I certainly can't.

141
00:09:25,847 --> 00:09:30,284
- Why are you dressed like that?
- I dress like this sometimes

142
00:09:30,644 --> 00:09:34,034
when I watch the opera on television.

143
00:09:34,356 --> 00:09:36,392
That's up there on the dork meter.

144
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:40,563
Since I'm not watching the opera,
I should buy a tape so I can record it.

145
00:09:40,904 --> 00:09:44,863
We're way ahead ofyou, Dr Crane.
Your father has the VCR all set up.

146
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,476
Let's get things started.
Here you go, Doc, happy birthday.

147
00:09:48,787 --> 00:09:51,221
Thank you, Bulldog. Thank you, all.

148
00:09:51,498 --> 00:09:57,414
David Copperfield. Dickens' classic tale
of a man making his way in the world.

149
00:09:57,838 --> 00:10:00,955
I thinkwe're talking about different
movies here, Doc.

150
00:10:01,967 --> 00:10:04,003
David Cop-A-Feel.

151
00:10:06,054 --> 00:10:08,329
But you were right
about the classic tail.

152
00:10:08,599 --> 00:10:11,511
- You need a brew? I'm headed that way.
- No, thanks.

153
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:15,439
- I'd love a cup of hot tea with lemon.
- I'm fetching, not cooking.

154
00:10:15,772 --> 00:10:18,764
There's a kettle of boiling water
on the stove.

155
00:10:19,067 --> 00:10:21,865
Here you are.
Now don't be mad at your father.

156
00:10:22,154 --> 00:10:27,467
He wanted to do something nice after
you turned down the skating monkeys.

157
00:10:28,493 --> 00:10:32,247
Great party. As long as we've got
enough ice. Four bags, right?

158
00:10:32,581 --> 00:10:35,141
- No, I got two.
- Two? I told you to get four bags.

159
00:10:35,417 --> 00:10:37,885
But you never under-budget on the ice.

160
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:41,321
You might get a lot
more rocks drinkers than you expected.

161
00:10:41,632 --> 00:10:44,988
- Or ice chewers...
- Dad, I can go get some more ice.

162
00:10:45,302 --> 00:10:48,214
We don't need any more ice.
There's a whole tub of it.

163
00:10:48,513 --> 00:10:52,108
Yes, well, then...
Excuse me. I need to make a call.

164
00:10:59,107 --> 00:11:01,302
Tricia? Frasier. I've been detained.

165
00:11:01,568 --> 00:11:04,640
Yes, I know that you
don't want to hear why, but...

166
00:11:04,947 --> 00:11:07,222
I think I can find a way
to get out of here.

167
00:11:07,491 --> 00:11:09,482
Yes, I'll see you in a few minutes.

168
00:11:13,497 --> 00:11:17,046
Dad, bad news.
Seems your ice is melting awfully fast.

169
00:11:17,376 --> 00:11:19,412
- What?
- I'll go get some more.

170
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:23,345
No, it's your party. I'll go.
You just got here.

171
00:11:23,674 --> 00:11:27,030
Roz, it's my birthday. I can do
what I want. I want to get ice.

172
00:11:27,344 --> 00:11:29,460
I warned her. It's practically gone.

173
00:11:29,721 --> 00:11:32,110
Don't worry, Dad. I'm on it.

174
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:35,827
- I'll be glad to go...
- I know what kind Dad likes.

175
00:11:40,357 --> 00:11:43,076
No, don't, don't stop on 14.
Just don't stop on 14.

176
00:11:46,655 --> 00:11:49,567
Frasier.
I'm delighted you're feeling better.

177
00:11:49,867 --> 00:11:54,145
We're about to start the film.
Wait until you see it.

178
00:11:54,496 --> 00:11:57,374
Just grab a chair
before all the good seats are gone.

179
00:11:59,376 --> 00:12:02,573
- What are you doing here?
- Wishing I had taken the stairs.

180
00:12:03,005 --> 00:12:05,473
Watch it.
If I'd wanted this martini shaken,

181
00:12:05,757 --> 00:12:08,191
I'd have asked the bartender
to do it.

182
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:13,978
Mustn't mind old Rhino.
Always in a vile mood.

183
00:12:14,308 --> 00:12:17,186
- Rhino?
- Karl Landis, Allison's husband.

184
00:12:17,477 --> 00:12:20,787
They call him Rhino
because of his mean temper.

185
00:12:21,106 --> 00:12:23,256
Husband? Allison's married?

186
00:12:23,525 --> 00:12:28,041
Not surprised people don't know.
He's always on safari. Loves guns.

187
00:12:28,405 --> 00:12:32,159
Guns and women.
No secret, notorious for it.

188
00:12:32,492 --> 00:12:35,723
Cheats on her constantly.
Mark my words/

189
00:12:36,038 --> 00:12:40,156
One day she'll pay him back and
then rub his blood-thirsty nose in it.

190
00:12:43,837 --> 00:12:46,795
I think I just swallowed my tongue.

191
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:49,809
Niles, just be calm. You didn't know.

192
00:12:50,093 --> 00:12:52,527
As long as you've both been discreet,

193
00:12:52,804 --> 00:12:55,364
there's no reason
it should get back to Rhino.

194
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:58,519
- I don't know what you're insinuating.
- Don't lie.

195
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:01,278
Everyone knows
what goes on in that pup tent.

196
00:13:01,563 --> 00:13:05,476
Well, I can play at that game, too.
In fact, I already have.

197
00:13:05,817 --> 00:13:10,811
And with somebody right here tonight.
How do you like that?

198
00:13:11,198 --> 00:13:15,635
I need you to create a distraction while
I have a sex change and move to Europe.

199
00:13:15,994 --> 00:13:20,226
I'm sorry, Niles. I would love to help,
but I've got to get out of here myself.

200
00:13:20,582 --> 00:13:23,779
Ready for the movie.
Mind helping me turn out the lights?

201
00:13:24,086 --> 00:13:28,238
Splendid idea. You're going to want it
nice and dark in here, aren'tyou?

202
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:31,548
You should've told me
you were married. I must leave.

203
00:13:31,843 --> 00:13:35,836
If he sees someone sneak out,
that's the first person he'll suspect.

204
00:13:36,181 --> 00:13:37,170
All set?

205
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,386
And it's show time.

206
00:13:40,644 --> 00:13:44,114
Here underthe leafy canopy
ofthe rainforest,

207
00:13:44,439 --> 00:13:47,795
the sun never penetrates
the gloom of the interior.

208
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:49,987
An almost subterran...

209
00:13:50,237 --> 00:13:53,035
- What happened?
- Did someone pull the plug out?

210
00:13:53,323 --> 00:13:55,678
Yup. Here it is.

211
00:13:55,951 --> 00:13:57,589
All right, lights out.

212
00:13:57,828 --> 00:14:01,662
...quality permeates this hidden
kingdom deep in the underbrush

213
00:14:01,999 --> 00:14:05,355
- and all manner of creatures...
- What was that?

214
00:14:05,669 --> 00:14:08,388
Someone certainly snuck out of here
in a hurry.

215
00:14:11,592 --> 00:14:13,583
I know what you're all thinking.

216
00:14:13,844 --> 00:14:17,996
Now that Allison has seen fit
to air our dirty laundry in public,

217
00:14:18,348 --> 00:14:21,897
you assume that was her lover.
But I know it wasn't.

218
00:14:24,938 --> 00:14:28,817
- How?
- I can sense that he's still here.

219
00:14:29,151 --> 00:14:34,942
In the jungle I learned
to smell fear and I smell it now.

220
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:41,824
So, let's see whether the swine
has guts to stand up and admit it

221
00:14:42,206 --> 00:14:44,561
before I expose him.

222
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:48,621
What about it, coward?
Going to stand up?

223
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:07,178
That many? My God, woman,
you're as bad as I am.

224
00:15:08,732 --> 00:15:11,007
Come on, you bastards,
join me in a drink.

225
00:15:19,368 --> 00:15:22,360
Hi, Dr Crane. We're all
on our way up to your place.

226
00:15:22,663 --> 00:15:28,101
Noel, so you are. Hi, Tom, Janet,
Bill. I was just heading down.

227
00:15:28,502 --> 00:15:34,293
- We're out of ice.
- Not anymore. I brought a 20-pound bag.

228
00:15:34,716 --> 00:15:38,265
Just call me Noel Shempsky/ Party Saver.

229
00:15:43,183 --> 00:15:46,573
Here's the ice. Here, Noel,
put that in the kitchen, will you?

230
00:15:47,771 --> 00:15:50,205
Dad, I went out without my wallet.

231
00:15:50,482 --> 00:15:53,315
They gave me the ice
but I have to go back and pay them.

232
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:56,329
At least play
the last round of charades with us.

233
00:15:56,613 --> 00:15:59,923
- I should be getting back there.
- But you love charades.

234
00:16:00,242 --> 00:16:03,359
It won't kill them
to wait a few minutes for their money.

235
00:16:03,662 --> 00:16:05,812
Be on our team. We really suck at this.

236
00:16:06,081 --> 00:16:10,074
- The category is famous play titles.
- I'm a bear at charades.

237
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:12,409
You ready?

238
00:16:12,629 --> 00:16:14,620
- Yeah.
- All right, go.

239
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:17,744
Three words. First word.

240
00:16:18,886 --> 00:16:20,524
Mourning Becomes Electra.

241
00:16:20,762 --> 00:16:23,720
- Yes!
- What? Four seconds?

242
00:16:25,183 --> 00:16:29,176
Well done, Roz. Nice playing with you.
I'm out of here.

243
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:33,116
You have to take a turn.
You have 30 seconds to prepare.

244
00:16:33,442 --> 00:16:36,957
Well, all right.
Maybe I'll just prepare in the kitchen.

245
00:16:43,118 --> 00:16:47,077
Tricia! You're going to laugh
when you hearthis. Hello? Tricia?

246
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:50,697
Fine.

247
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:55,275
The Iceman Cometh

248
00:16:57,007 --> 00:17:00,079
- All right.
- Ready? OK, go.

249
00:17:01,261 --> 00:17:03,331
Three words. First word.

250
00:17:03,597 --> 00:17:05,588
A small word.

251
00:17:05,849 --> 00:17:08,568
On? In? Of? To?

252
00:17:08,852 --> 00:17:11,082
Be? Is? It? I? You? Me?

253
00:17:11,355 --> 00:17:13,949
They, them, us, we, he, she.

254
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:15,791
Forget about it.

255
00:17:16,026 --> 00:17:18,062
OK, second word. Two syllables.

256
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,470
First syllable.

257
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:22,969
Cold, chilly, freezing, winter.

258
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:27,121
Snow, sleet, hail, frost,
frostbite, gangrene.

259
00:17:27,454 --> 00:17:30,048
- Gangrene?
- No talking allowed.

260
00:17:31,959 --> 00:17:33,278
Second syllable.

261
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:37,848
Shrink. Doctor. Dork.

262
00:17:39,216 --> 00:17:41,605
Person, guy, male, man.

263
00:17:41,885 --> 00:17:46,242
Man, man, man. Let's see,
lcy cold man, ice man. Got it.

264
00:17:46,598 --> 00:17:49,396
- Thank you.
- Frosty The Snowman. Yes!

265
00:17:49,685 --> 00:17:52,404
No, you jackass! The Iceman Cometh.

266
00:17:52,688 --> 00:17:54,041
Disqualified.

267
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:57,504
You two are the worst charades players
I've ever seen.

268
00:17:57,818 --> 00:18:00,491
Those skating chimps could...

269
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:03,816
You did your best.
We'll get it next time. Off I go.

270
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:07,552
No, wait, Frasier. We still have
a consolation prize for you.

271
00:18:19,214 --> 00:18:21,205
Look, he's crying.

272
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,395
- Made it.
- Boy, are you wrong.

273
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:51,970
I have a plane
leaving for Spokane in an hour.

274
00:18:52,289 --> 00:18:56,328
My cab is on the way, so why don't
you just be on your way, too?

275
00:18:56,668 --> 00:18:59,023
But I had to sneak out
of a birthday party

276
00:18:59,296 --> 00:19:02,606
being given for me by my own father
just to come here.

277
00:19:02,925 --> 00:19:05,234
Yeah, right. It's your birthday.

278
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:08,741
Ifyou don't believe me, here,
just see for yourself.

279
00:19:09,056 --> 00:19:11,809
It's the worst birthday
I've had since I was eight,

280
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,409
when I pinned
the tail on Sally Annunciato.

281
00:19:14,686 --> 00:19:16,836
She shoved a cupcake down my shorts.

282
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:21,899
You really blew offyour own
birthday party just to come meet me.

283
00:19:22,236 --> 00:19:26,070
I would've done almost anything
to get to know you better.

284
00:19:26,406 --> 00:19:29,204
That's very sweet,
and I wish I had more time

285
00:19:29,493 --> 00:19:33,725
but I have an 8.00am appointment
in Spokane and I can't miss my plane.

286
00:19:34,081 --> 00:19:37,960
- I could drive you.
- It's only 20 minutes to the airport.

287
00:19:38,293 --> 00:19:41,285
- I wasn't talking about the airport.
- What?

288
00:19:41,588 --> 00:19:45,547
I can get to Spokane in six hours.
Enough time to get acquainted.

289
00:19:45,884 --> 00:19:48,956
- I can't ask you to do that.
- You didn't ask. I offered.

290
00:19:49,263 --> 00:19:50,742
I want to do it. Here...

291
00:19:51,682 --> 00:19:54,401
That's the most romantic thing
I've ever heard.

292
00:19:54,685 --> 00:19:59,315
One of two things can happen. We'll
discover that we've built each other up

293
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:02,363
because we had such trouble
getting together,

294
00:20:02,651 --> 00:20:07,202
or this could end up being a story
we tell our grandchildren.

295
00:20:09,658 --> 00:20:12,809
Personally,
I can't wait to find out which.

296
00:20:13,787 --> 00:20:15,345
Me neither.

297
00:20:26,925 --> 00:20:28,597
Offwe go.

298
00:20:36,018 --> 00:20:38,532
I thought I'd find us
some background music.

299
00:20:38,812 --> 00:20:42,088
Good idea.
Looking for some more opera?

300
00:20:42,399 --> 00:20:45,311
No. The one the other night
was my first and last.

301
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:48,648
I was dragged to it
by one of my converts.

302
00:20:49,823 --> 00:20:51,620
There we go.

303
00:20:52,868 --> 00:20:54,904
Converts, you say?

304
00:20:55,162 --> 00:20:58,871
I'm one of the Truth-Bringers.
I was ordained by Brother Carmichael.

305
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:03,281
The evangelist? I go door-to-door,
spreading his word.

306
00:21:06,548 --> 00:21:10,621
Do you mind my asking something?
Have you heard the truth?

307
00:21:14,223 --> 00:21:16,737
Something tells me I'm about to.
