1
00:00:11,059 --> 00:00:13,368
Good afternoon, Betsy.
I'm listening.

2
00:00:13,645 --> 00:00:17,684
Hi, Dr Crane. My husband wants to
take me on a cruise for our anniversary.

3
00:00:19,651 --> 00:00:21,084
That sounds enchanting.

4
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:24,392
Except I keep having this dream
where I'm in a cabin,

5
00:00:24,698 --> 00:00:27,895
and I see a few drops of water,
it's starting to leak in.

6
00:00:28,201 --> 00:00:32,513
At first it's just a trickle, then
it's gushing, pouring water everywhere

7
00:00:32,873 --> 00:00:36,502
and there's nothing in the world
that I can do to stop it.

8
00:00:36,835 --> 00:00:41,067
That's a very powerful image,
wouldn't you say so, Roz?

9
00:00:41,423 --> 00:00:42,617
Roz agrees.

10
00:00:42,841 --> 00:00:45,753
Excuse me,
I'm looking for Frasier Crane.

11
00:00:46,053 --> 00:00:49,568
Lilith, it's me, Roz Doyle.

12
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,881
Yes, Frasier's fun-loving producer.

13
00:00:52,142 --> 00:00:55,259
Who's apparently been having
a bit too much fun... Ioving.

14
00:00:57,397 --> 00:01:00,787
I'd love to send one back at you,
but I've got to pee.

15
00:01:02,569 --> 00:01:05,037
Well, that's all the time
we have for today.

16
00:01:05,322 --> 00:01:08,917
This is Dr Frasier Crane wishing you
a good day and good mental...

17
00:01:13,246 --> 00:01:17,398
I'm sorry. Someone just walked in
the room and frightened me. My ex-wife.

18
00:01:17,751 --> 00:01:21,460
If you're a regular listener,
you know what I'm talking about.

19
00:01:21,797 --> 00:01:23,788
We'll see you Monday.

20
00:01:24,883 --> 00:01:26,601
Hello, Lilith.

21
00:01:27,219 --> 00:01:30,052
- Surprise.
- We're a little past that now.

22
00:01:31,098 --> 00:01:33,089
What brings you to Seattle?

23
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:37,309
The National Conference
on Self-Psychology.

24
00:01:37,646 --> 00:01:40,638
- How is Frederick?
- Fine. We have an amazing child.

25
00:01:40,941 --> 00:01:42,738
Yes, we have.

26
00:01:42,985 --> 00:01:47,297
- And Brian?
- Fine. I have an amazing husband.

27
00:01:48,156 --> 00:01:51,865
So, did you two get the gift basket
I sent you for the holidays?

28
00:01:52,202 --> 00:01:54,193
What did you do to her?

29
00:01:54,454 --> 00:01:57,924
Nothing. I sent her a gift basket.
Fruits and festive nuts.

30
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:01,048
No, it's not the basket, you nit.

31
00:02:01,336 --> 00:02:04,931
It's Brian. He left me.

32
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:08,541
Maybe I should go.

33
00:02:08,802 --> 00:02:12,317
No, everyone else knows it.
You might as well know it, too.

34
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:16,871
Brian was looking for someone
a bit more... feminine.

35
00:02:18,603 --> 00:02:21,163
And he found him.

36
00:02:26,903 --> 00:02:29,781
Stan Jablonsky, that little hussy.

37
00:02:32,617 --> 00:02:34,972
Oh, Lilith...

38
00:02:35,704 --> 00:02:38,093
I am genuinely sorry.

39
00:02:38,373 --> 00:02:42,252
I didn't know where to turn but I knew
somehow you would be here for me.

40
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:47,235
- So you didn't come for the conference?
- No.

41
00:02:47,549 --> 00:02:49,744
You shouldn't be alone tonight.

42
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:53,639
Niles and I are going to the Union Club.
Would you like to join us?

43
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,398
Thankyou, Frasier. I'd love to.

44
00:02:59,686 --> 00:03:02,405
I don't know if I deserve
your compassion,

45
00:03:02,689 --> 00:03:07,080
but I feel better already just holding
your strong, comforting hands.

46
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:12,590
You know, I'll always be here for you.

47
00:03:13,325 --> 00:03:15,919
I could stay in these arms all day.

48
00:03:22,751 --> 00:03:26,426
You'll have to excuse me.
I have an appointment.

49
00:03:26,755 --> 00:03:29,633
Station manager.
Very important. Can't be broken.

50
00:03:29,925 --> 00:03:33,315
I'll see you tonight. Bye-bye.

51
00:03:40,143 --> 00:03:42,941
That's rough,
leaving you for another man.

52
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:45,949
- Did you have any idea?
- No, none at all.

53
00:03:46,233 --> 00:03:49,908
Stan was a contractor
we'd hired to expand our master bedroom.

54
00:03:50,237 --> 00:03:53,707
It's ironic, isn't it? No sooner
do I get the closet of my dreams

55
00:03:54,032 --> 00:03:56,421
than my husband comes out of it.

56
00:04:05,585 --> 00:04:07,894
- Hello, Niles.
- Frasier.

57
00:04:08,171 --> 00:04:11,720
- That bun looks good.
- Remember your diet.

58
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:15,520
Speaking of buns I could do without,
Lilith is back.

59
00:04:17,264 --> 00:04:21,815
That explains why blood was pouring
from all myfaucets this morning.

60
00:04:24,396 --> 00:04:27,706
Go easy on her.
Her husband has left her.

61
00:04:28,025 --> 00:04:30,823
And get this... for a man.

62
00:04:31,111 --> 00:04:33,227
Damn. I owe Dad five dollars.

63
00:04:40,329 --> 00:04:43,719
She's devastated.
Her world's been turned upside down.

64
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:47,795
But you know better than anyone
how a messy divorce can leave one...

65
00:04:52,716 --> 00:04:54,866
...strangely relaxed.

66
00:04:55,135 --> 00:04:57,603
- Niles?
- Yes.

67
00:04:57,888 --> 00:05:02,040
- Am I boring you?
- Did I do it again? I'm sorry, Frasier.

68
00:05:02,392 --> 00:05:04,701
I'm suffering a bout of narcolepsy.

69
00:05:04,978 --> 00:05:08,334
Good Lord. When did this start?

70
00:05:08,649 --> 00:05:12,562
After we started divorce proceedings.
I checked with my doctor.

71
00:05:12,903 --> 00:05:17,294
It's a reaction to stress.
My way of escaping the whole ugly mess.

72
00:05:17,658 --> 00:05:19,649
Go on with what you were saying.

73
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:22,549
Lilith is distraught
and she's come to me

74
00:05:22,829 --> 00:05:27,027
to help her make sense of it.
I find it just a bit disconcerting.

75
00:05:27,376 --> 00:05:29,810
- How so?
- We have a destructive pattern.

76
00:05:30,087 --> 00:05:33,841
Whenever she comes to me in need,
I find her vulnerability desirable.

77
00:05:34,174 --> 00:05:37,052
We end up in bed
and I'm left with feelings of regret.

78
00:05:37,344 --> 00:05:40,780
- And you felt this way about hertoday?
- Oh, baby!

79
00:05:43,517 --> 00:05:45,872
Well, do your best to avoid her.

80
00:05:46,144 --> 00:05:50,023
- She's coming to the Union Club.
- What? She's going to be there?

81
00:05:50,357 --> 00:05:55,033
It's a bunch of stuffed shirts talking
about their portfolios and prostates.

82
00:05:55,404 --> 00:05:58,396
Exactly, and you've ruined it.
Excuse me.

83
00:05:58,699 --> 00:06:02,738
Yes? Damn.
It's one of Maris' cadre of lawyers.

84
00:06:05,247 --> 00:06:08,284
We've been over that.
No, I can't.

85
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:11,017
How dare you? She already has the house.

86
00:06:11,294 --> 00:06:13,683
I'm not even allowed
to visit the koi pond.

87
00:06:19,469 --> 00:06:20,458
Niles.

88
00:06:20,679 --> 00:06:22,829
I'm not even allowed
to visit the koi pond.

89
00:06:23,098 --> 00:06:24,611
Give me that!

90
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:26,841
He will call you back.

91
00:06:27,686 --> 00:06:31,679
Aren't we a pair? A narcoleptic
and a weak-willed sexual obsessive.

92
00:06:32,024 --> 00:06:35,494
We look like a couple of brothers
out of an O'Neill play.

93
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:41,158
Come on, boy. Daph, come down here.
I taught him a new trick.

94
00:06:41,491 --> 00:06:43,607
I was reading in a movie magazine

95
00:06:43,869 --> 00:06:47,305
there's a stunt dog
they taught to ride a motorcycle

96
00:06:47,622 --> 00:06:49,817
into a burning building, pick up a baby

97
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:53,280
then jump out the window to safety.
What did you teach Eddie?

98
00:06:55,255 --> 00:06:57,485
To roll over.

99
00:06:57,758 --> 00:06:59,794
You must be very proud.

100
00:07:01,678 --> 00:07:03,828
Forget it, Eddie.

101
00:07:05,932 --> 00:07:07,923
- Hey, Niles.
- Evening, Dad. Daphne.

102
00:07:08,185 --> 00:07:11,461
Hello, Niles. Sherry?
We have time before Lilith arrives.

103
00:07:11,772 --> 00:07:17,051
- You never said she was coming here.
- You said you were going to dinner.

104
00:07:17,444 --> 00:07:20,277
It's just to rendezvous.
It's all of two minutes.

105
00:07:20,572 --> 00:07:24,042
You never told me.
Not a word. Did he say anything to you?

106
00:07:24,368 --> 00:07:27,440
No. We could
have made plans to be elsewhere.

107
00:07:27,746 --> 00:07:31,659
How come you didn't know about it?
You used to know these things.

108
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,912
All right, she's coming.
Both ofyou, suck it up.

109
00:07:36,213 --> 00:07:39,922
Lilith has had a devastating week.
Her husband has left her.

110
00:07:40,258 --> 00:07:43,853
Show a little compassion,
unless you'd like to hide in your rooms

111
00:07:44,179 --> 00:07:48,536
iftwo minutes of polite conversation
with her is too much to ask.

112
00:07:48,892 --> 00:07:51,850
- Out of my way.
- Me, too.

113
00:07:52,145 --> 00:07:53,578
Leave it!

114
00:07:58,026 --> 00:08:01,860
Remember, I'm here for you
ifyou feel yourself starting to weaken.

115
00:08:02,197 --> 00:08:06,509
I'm fine. Believe me,
I am in complete control.

116
00:08:07,953 --> 00:08:09,671
Oh, baby.

117
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,849
Thank you, Frasier. I needed that.

118
00:08:14,126 --> 00:08:18,165
I treated myselfto a little shopping.
Probably just a pathetic attempt

119
00:08:18,505 --> 00:08:21,622
to compensate for the battering
my ego's taken recently.

120
00:08:21,925 --> 00:08:26,919
- It's pretty transparent, huh?
- No, but ifyou stand in the light...

121
00:08:29,933 --> 00:08:33,369
Niles, sorry to hear
your marriage ended in a shambles.

122
00:08:33,687 --> 00:08:36,042
Ditto.

123
00:08:39,026 --> 00:08:43,258
Now that we've got the pleasantries
out ofthe way, let me take your wrap.

124
00:08:44,865 --> 00:08:46,059
Yowsa!

125
00:08:46,283 --> 00:08:48,717
Lilith, that dress is stunning.

126
00:08:48,994 --> 00:08:52,066
- Frasier, may I see you in the kitchen?
- No.

127
00:08:53,707 --> 00:08:57,461
It's from a new couture line
called Encore.

128
00:08:57,794 --> 00:09:01,548
Bravo.
I can almost feel the curtain rising.

129
00:09:01,882 --> 00:09:05,397
Frasier. Excuse us, we'll be right back.

130
00:09:05,719 --> 00:09:07,710
Eddie will entertain you.

131
00:09:10,849 --> 00:09:12,487
Hello, Eddie.

132
00:09:15,312 --> 00:09:18,941
Damn her. She knows
what she's doing dressing like that.

133
00:09:19,274 --> 00:09:22,869
The woman plays me like a lute.
I guess you know about that.

134
00:09:23,195 --> 00:09:27,313
I've got all the resistance of a horny
stag. Niles, you've got to help me.

135
00:09:27,658 --> 00:09:28,773
Niles?

136
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:38,491
- Did I do it again?
- With your cheek against the ice tray.

137
00:09:38,835 --> 00:09:41,907
That's so strange.
I dreamt I was tangoing with Maris.

138
00:09:44,508 --> 00:09:47,580
I need your help resisting Lilith.

139
00:09:47,886 --> 00:09:51,162
All right, let me think.
I think I have the answer.

140
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:54,199
When you feel yourselfyielding to her,

141
00:09:54,476 --> 00:09:59,266
summon an image so repellentyou'll
be incapable of any sexual desire.

142
00:09:59,648 --> 00:10:03,880
Remember at Uncle Henry's farm we
found that dead horse lying in the sun,

143
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:06,466
- crawling with maggots?
- Yes, of course.

144
00:10:06,738 --> 00:10:09,935
Hold on to that picture.
You can ride that horse to safety.

145
00:10:11,493 --> 00:10:14,132
Thank you, Niles.
That might just do the trick.

146
00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:17,610
When it comes to an ugly image,
you can't beat a dead horse.

147
00:10:21,962 --> 00:10:23,998
Feel up to facing her again?

148
00:10:24,256 --> 00:10:26,531
Yes. Let her bat her eyes
all she wants to.

149
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,633
She can push her breasts up to Canada.
I won't budge.

150
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:40,969
Morning.

151
00:10:43,066 --> 00:10:44,055
Morning.

152
00:11:03,128 --> 00:11:06,643
My God. What did we do?
What did we do?

153
00:11:07,924 --> 00:11:11,234
- First you put your...
- I know what we did. What do we do now?

154
00:11:12,846 --> 00:11:16,555
Let's try to stay calm. These things
happen. They happen every day.

155
00:11:17,976 --> 00:11:19,967
Every day in Arkansas.

156
00:11:25,776 --> 00:11:28,415
Frasier is going to kill us.

157
00:11:28,695 --> 00:11:31,255
Why did you
have to look so bewitching?

158
00:11:31,531 --> 00:11:34,125
Why did you have to drive me home?

159
00:11:34,409 --> 00:11:38,925
There's no point in pointing fingers.
We both know why this happened.

160
00:11:39,289 --> 00:11:44,727
Last night was two wounded people
overcome with loneliness and confusion

161
00:11:45,128 --> 00:11:47,562
- and...
- Tequila shooters.

162
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:53,254
- Who's that?
- Don't panic. No one knows we're here.

163
00:11:53,553 --> 00:11:57,546
- I told Frasier I was driving you home.
- Why do a stupid thing like that?

164
00:11:57,891 --> 00:12:00,359
It wasn't stupid at the time.
How did I know

165
00:12:00,644 --> 00:12:04,080
when we got in this room you'd
be on me like a hawk on a titmouse?

166
00:12:06,858 --> 00:12:08,894
Just be quiet.

167
00:12:09,152 --> 00:12:11,268
- Who is it?
- Room service, ma'am.

168
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:14,886
That's right.
We ordered breakfast last night.

169
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,191
Good morning, ma'am.
Morning, sir.

170
00:12:17,452 --> 00:12:20,012
I have eggs Benedict
and eggs Florentine.

171
00:12:20,288 --> 00:12:23,086
- Did you bring ketchup?
- No. I'm sorry.

172
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:26,890
- Let me get that for you right now.
- Ketchup on eggs Florentine?

173
00:12:27,212 --> 00:12:30,010
- Your first breakfast together?
- Just get it.

174
00:12:33,593 --> 00:12:35,709
Now I remember ordering this.

175
00:12:35,971 --> 00:12:39,202
It's the breakfast I always have
after a night of passion.

176
00:12:39,516 --> 00:12:43,634
- Eggs Benedict? That's very rich.
- I only have it once a year.

177
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:52,135
- That was quick.
- Lilith, are you awake?

178
00:12:52,404 --> 00:12:55,282
It's Frasier. Just a second.

179
00:12:55,574 --> 00:12:58,008
- What do we do?
- Hide in the bathroom.

180
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:03,529
No, not you.

181
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:06,179
Wait a minute. Wait.
Take the cart with you.

182
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:09,020
Wait. Food in the bathroom?

183
00:13:12,424 --> 00:13:13,413
Lilith?

184
00:13:16,178 --> 00:13:18,453
Hello, Frasier. What are you doing here?

185
00:13:18,722 --> 00:13:21,077
Surrendering, Lilith. I'm yours.

186
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:23,466
- No, Frasier.
- Please don't punish me

187
00:13:23,727 --> 00:13:27,959
for playing hard-to-get last night.
It was everything I had to resist you.

188
00:13:28,315 --> 00:13:29,668
This isn't right.

189
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:34,098
Can you saythat in bed last night
you weren't thinking about me?

190
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:35,435
Yes.

191
00:13:36,281 --> 00:13:39,398
Drop the mask, Lilith.
We both knowwhyyou came to Seattle.

192
00:13:39,701 --> 00:13:43,376
We both know why you dressed
so enticingly last night.

193
00:13:50,045 --> 00:13:53,242
- Is someone in your bathroom?
- No. It's a defective toilet.

194
00:13:53,548 --> 00:13:57,780
It's been doing that all night.
I think I'll just go check it right now.

195
00:14:01,223 --> 00:14:03,339
- Niles.
- Yes?

196
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,875
You fell asleep and flushed the toilet.

197
00:14:06,144 --> 00:14:07,975
Damn. Is he still here?

198
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:12,382
- Yes. He wants to make love to me.
- Does the man have no scruples?

199
00:14:15,028 --> 00:14:17,781
He asked me last night
to keep him away from you.

200
00:14:18,073 --> 00:14:22,146
The minute my back is turned, he sneaks
here, yes, I'm aware of the irony.

201
00:14:22,577 --> 00:14:24,568
I'll just ask him to leave.

202
00:14:28,709 --> 00:14:31,746
- My God.
- My goddess.

203
00:14:37,801 --> 00:14:40,190
- Room service.
- Go away.

204
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:43,428
- I have your ketchup, ma'am.
- Not necessary.

205
00:14:43,724 --> 00:14:46,443
- OK, but I need the bill.
- Later.

206
00:14:46,727 --> 00:14:48,604
Let's just take care of this.

207
00:14:50,772 --> 00:14:53,969
I'm sorry to disturb you.
Here's the ketchup.

208
00:14:54,276 --> 00:14:56,346
Sorry it took so... Iong.

209
00:14:58,488 --> 00:15:01,002
I still need the bill.

210
00:15:01,283 --> 00:15:03,274
Where's the cart?

211
00:15:05,162 --> 00:15:08,552
- In the bathroom.
- Why is it in the bathroom?

212
00:15:08,874 --> 00:15:12,264
I was going to take a hot bath
while I ate.

213
00:15:12,586 --> 00:15:15,259
Still, food in the bathroom.

214
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:18,562
Be right back.

215
00:15:22,304 --> 00:15:25,376
Well, this is a little embarrassing.

216
00:15:25,682 --> 00:15:29,072
My ex-wife. We're sort of reconnecting.

217
00:15:29,394 --> 00:15:32,466
Yes, sir, that's wonderful.

218
00:15:32,773 --> 00:15:34,923
It may just work out this time.

219
00:15:35,734 --> 00:15:36,723
OK.

220
00:15:39,863 --> 00:15:43,412
There you go. There's a generous,
generous tip in there for you.

221
00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:44,731
Thank you, ma'am.

222
00:15:44,951 --> 00:15:48,307
Why don't you
send up an order of eggs Benedict?

223
00:15:48,622 --> 00:15:51,420
No reason why she should eat alone.

224
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,069
OK.

225
00:15:56,838 --> 00:15:58,317
Now, where were we?

226
00:15:58,548 --> 00:16:01,824
- This isn't a good time for this.
- Why not, Lilith?

227
00:16:02,135 --> 00:16:05,252
Please, we're alone. We're here.
You need your Frasier.

228
00:16:08,016 --> 00:16:10,849
- What the hell was that?
- Wait! No, don't go in there.

229
00:16:12,437 --> 00:16:14,667
- Niles.
- Yes?

230
00:16:15,524 --> 00:16:16,513
My God!

231
00:16:17,859 --> 00:16:21,738
- Frasier, I'm sorry.
- Frasier, it was a mistake.

232
00:16:22,072 --> 00:16:25,826
Stop it, Niles. Don't tell me how it
was. I've just got to get out of here.

233
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:27,797
Frasier, you...

234
00:16:28,745 --> 00:16:31,703
- This is my worst nightmare.
- You have egg on your face.

235
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:35,355
- That is an understatement.
- No, actual egg.

236
00:16:39,339 --> 00:16:41,409
It's in your hair, too.

237
00:16:41,675 --> 00:16:45,748
- I knew you couldn't stay mad at us.
- I'm in a bathrobe, you jackass.

238
00:16:48,598 --> 00:16:54,070
I can understand your shock and
if I could erase last night, I would.

239
00:16:54,479 --> 00:16:58,518
But ifyou could just look at this
rationally, just for a moment.

240
00:16:58,859 --> 00:17:01,612
We didn't technically do anything wrong.

241
00:17:01,903 --> 00:17:05,373
What? You didn't do anything wrong?

242
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:10,011
I'm a little unclear on that myself,
but I'm willing to go along with it.

243
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:13,168
You are I are no longer married.
Neither is Niles.

244
00:17:13,457 --> 00:17:15,448
I won't say this is my shining hour,

245
00:17:15,709 --> 00:17:19,145
but we are not responsible to you
or anyone else for our actions.

246
00:17:19,463 --> 00:17:22,773
- You're defending what you did?
- Just listen.

247
00:17:23,091 --> 00:17:26,447
The past few days
have been the worst of my life.

248
00:17:26,762 --> 00:17:30,516
I have never been less self-assured,
more in need ofvalidation,

249
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:33,079
both as a person
and especially as a woman.

250
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:36,264
- Niles was feeling the same thing.
- Exactly.

251
00:17:36,563 --> 00:17:38,554
Wait a minute.

252
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:41,010
Our physical reaction to each other

253
00:17:41,276 --> 00:17:46,908
was nothing more than a desperate
attempt to reaffirm our own worth.

254
00:17:49,284 --> 00:17:51,923
That is very impressive, Dr Sternin.

255
00:17:53,497 --> 00:17:55,692
But l, too, happen to be a psychiatrist.

256
00:17:55,957 --> 00:17:59,074
Let me tell you
what actually transpired.

257
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:02,176
This was a passive-aggressive
manifestation

258
00:18:02,464 --> 00:18:04,694
of your deep resentments toward me.

259
00:18:04,967 --> 00:18:07,640
Niles, you were punishing me
for my notoriety.

260
00:18:07,928 --> 00:18:11,125
You, for my successful adjustment
after our divorce.

261
00:18:11,431 --> 00:18:14,070
It is this shared bond
that brought the two ofyou

262
00:18:14,351 --> 00:18:16,581
to your palace of sweet revenge.

263
00:18:16,853 --> 00:18:19,765
Allow me to rebut/ What a crock.

264
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:21,544
- It is not.
- It is so.

265
00:18:21,775 --> 00:18:26,610
It's an example of your self-absorption
which is why we could not stay together.

266
00:18:26,989 --> 00:18:30,186
I have a right to...
Why am I defending myself?

267
00:18:30,492 --> 00:18:32,608
Ifyou ask me,
you are both off the mark.

268
00:18:32,869 --> 00:18:37,226
Last night was about two people
ruled by very powerful superegos,

269
00:18:37,582 --> 00:18:40,938
tortured by them,
who found a chance, however misguided,

270
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:44,529
to break through and rediscover
their ids together.

271
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:47,957
Call me an old softy,
but that's how I see it.

272
00:18:50,262 --> 00:18:51,854
OK, then.

273
00:18:54,224 --> 00:18:59,503
The three of us have certainly
analysed the crap out of this.

274
00:19:01,398 --> 00:19:04,390
Yes, where do we all go from here?

275
00:19:05,902 --> 00:19:07,494
I don't know.

276
00:19:10,824 --> 00:19:13,418
That's my cell phone.
It's in my jacket pocket.

277
00:19:17,956 --> 00:19:20,629
Ifyou had given in to me last night

278
00:19:20,917 --> 00:19:25,229
instead of this morning, the
three of us would not be in this hell.

279
00:19:25,589 --> 00:19:28,467
No, it would be the two of us
in a whole different hell.

280
00:19:28,759 --> 00:19:33,355
I've been manipulated byyou jackals
enough. I'll see you in court.

281
00:19:34,389 --> 00:19:37,620
The very idea that Maris
still thinks she can...

282
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:43,592
I'm not sleeping. That conversation
should have put me out like a light.

283
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:48,058
It's not surprising. Your experience
with Maris has been emasculating.

284
00:19:48,403 --> 00:19:52,919
Last night may have gone a long way
toward restoring your self-confidence.

285
00:19:53,283 --> 00:19:55,797
Of course. And by the same token,

286
00:19:56,078 --> 00:19:59,036
you can now give up the assumption
that Brian left you

287
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:02,846
because you're unattractive.
You have evidence to the contrary.

288
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:05,079
Yes, I have. To hell with Brian.

289
00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:08,170
If he wants a prissy little wife,
he can keep Stan.

290
00:20:09,716 --> 00:20:12,276
Isn't this peachy?

291
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:18,013
Everything's turned out fine.
You two have solved your problems.

292
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:22,662
The waiter received a handsome tip.
Niles and I have matching bathrobes.

293
00:20:23,021 --> 00:20:25,137
And it's not even 9.30 yet.

294
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:30,844
Frasier, try to understand.

295
00:20:31,113 --> 00:20:35,584
- What happened last night was...
- Stop it, both of you. Enough.

296
00:20:35,951 --> 00:20:38,909
It happened and I'm just
going to have to deal with it.

297
00:20:39,204 --> 00:20:43,163
I suppose in a twisted way
there is one positive for me in this.

298
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,617
You see, Lilith,
I have never stopped desiring you,

299
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,832
even though I know
we are wrong for each other.

300
00:20:50,132 --> 00:20:54,364
But now, from this day forward,
whenever I look at your face,

301
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,518
I will see the back
of my brother's head.

302
00:21:00,517 --> 00:21:04,112
And that is one bucket of ice water,
let me tell you.

303
00:21:06,023 --> 00:21:08,537
- You know, Frasier...
- Enough, Lilith.

304
00:21:13,488 --> 00:21:15,479
Maybe I'll just go...

305
00:21:17,075 --> 00:21:19,066
...have some breakfast.

306
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:26,574
Are we OK?

307
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:29,330
No, we're not.

308
00:21:31,715 --> 00:21:33,512
But we will be.

309
00:21:34,551 --> 00:21:37,145
Well, that's enough for now.

310
00:21:40,057 --> 00:21:42,366
We're an odd little family, aren't we?

311
00:21:46,647 --> 00:21:48,638
Room service.

312
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:54,499
Here's your eggs Benedict.
If you could just...

313
00:22:01,703 --> 00:22:02,692
OK.
