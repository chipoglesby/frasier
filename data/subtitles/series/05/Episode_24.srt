1
00:00:09,266 --> 00:00:11,541
Half-caf latte, please.

2
00:00:13,353 --> 00:00:16,709
- I like this new system. It's lively.
- What can I get for you?

3
00:00:17,024 --> 00:00:19,697
I'll have a double short,
low-fat, no-foam latte.

4
00:00:19,985 --> 00:00:24,501
- Double short, low-fat, no-foam latte.
- Double short, non-fat, low-foam latte.

5
00:00:24,865 --> 00:00:29,017
I think there was a problem.
The middle person reversed part of it.

6
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:32,042
She said double short, non-fat,
low-foam latte.

7
00:00:32,331 --> 00:00:36,768
- Double short, non-fat, low-foam latte.
- Double short, non-fat, low-foam latte.

8
00:00:37,127 --> 00:00:39,641
No, you did it again.
That's not what I want.

9
00:00:39,921 --> 00:00:42,276
You can just tell her yourself.

10
00:00:42,549 --> 00:00:44,824
A double short, low-fat, no-foam latte.

11
00:00:45,093 --> 00:00:47,846
Double short, low-fat, no-foam latte.

12
00:00:48,138 --> 00:00:49,127
- Nutmeg?
- Nutmeg?

13
00:00:49,348 --> 00:00:51,816
No, thanks.
It inflames my stomach lining.

14
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,978
Inflames his stomach lining.

15
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:57,420
Stop that.

16
00:00:57,689 --> 00:00:59,839
- Hello, Niles.
- Welcome back.

17
00:01:00,108 --> 00:01:02,668
I trust you and Samantha
had a pleasant weekend?

18
00:01:02,944 --> 00:01:06,619
It was fabulous. We stayed at this
gorgeous cabin just outside Aspen,

19
00:01:06,948 --> 00:01:10,463
took a chopper every day up
the mountain. I didn't want it to end.

20
00:01:10,786 --> 00:01:15,018
Is that why you're still wearing
that jacket in an overheated cafe?

21
00:01:15,374 --> 00:01:18,889
In Aspen we all wear them indoors.
The funniest thing happened.

22
00:01:19,211 --> 00:01:21,202
Jack Nicholson and Tom Brokaw

23
00:01:21,463 --> 00:01:24,375
were wearing the same jacket,
so they staged a fight.

24
00:01:24,675 --> 00:01:26,506
Donna Karan flew in to referee.

25
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:30,799
I laughed so hard I nearly spilled my
toddy on someone named Boof Daddy.

26
00:01:31,139 --> 00:01:33,369
Can I get anything else?

27
00:01:33,642 --> 00:01:36,759
A dustpan and broom to sweep up
some of these names.

28
00:01:38,647 --> 00:01:40,126
Cappuccino, please.

29
00:01:40,357 --> 00:01:43,508
- Niles, did we have plans for tonight?
- Yes, why?

30
00:01:43,819 --> 00:01:49,098
It's my one-month anniversary with Sam.
I'd like to take her to L'Escalier.

31
00:01:49,491 --> 00:01:51,766
I understand. One month is a milestone.

32
00:01:52,035 --> 00:01:55,152
Thanks for the reminder.
I need to change my water filter.

33
00:01:56,623 --> 00:01:58,375
They put nutmeg on this.

34
00:01:58,625 --> 00:02:01,059
Meg Ryan told me
about the practical joke

35
00:02:01,336 --> 00:02:04,408
Tony Hopkins played on Jodie
at the wrap party for Lambs.

36
00:02:04,715 --> 00:02:08,071
My stomach lining is just not going
to get a break today, is it?

37
00:02:13,765 --> 00:02:16,643
- Sorry I was late.
- That's all right.

38
00:02:16,935 --> 00:02:19,529
I ordered us
the "Taste of Monaco" dinner.

39
00:02:19,813 --> 00:02:21,451
Good choice.

40
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:24,523
That's what you ordered
on our first date.

41
00:02:24,818 --> 00:02:27,890
Of course, it wasn't food
you were craving that night.

42
00:02:28,196 --> 00:02:33,111
You whisked me away back to my place
before the crab cakes could even arrive.

43
00:02:33,493 --> 00:02:36,451
There's no better way
to celebrate an anniversary

44
00:02:36,747 --> 00:02:39,261
than with an historical re-enactment.

45
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:41,736
I've got my costume on underneath.

46
00:02:42,002 --> 00:02:44,835
I'm really looking forward
to those crab cakes.

47
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:49,009
Great. Well, yes, I suppose
we should try the food here once.

48
00:02:49,343 --> 00:02:54,736
But leave some room. You'll find
a Frasier mint on your pillow later.

49
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:58,416
By the way,
thanks again for this weekend.

50
00:02:58,727 --> 00:03:00,558
You're welcome.

51
00:03:00,812 --> 00:03:05,681
I think it was a turning point for us.
Well, for me. See, I was so relaxed.

52
00:03:06,068 --> 00:03:08,787
I'm usually very tentative.

53
00:03:09,071 --> 00:03:12,427
I have this dark fear
that I'm about to be cut loose.

54
00:03:12,741 --> 00:03:15,778
- Frasier?
- I'm just being so insecure.

55
00:03:16,078 --> 00:03:18,717
It's nice to know I'm on solid ground.

56
00:03:18,997 --> 00:03:22,990
- Frasier...
- I'm standing on quicksand, aren't l?

57
00:03:24,086 --> 00:03:26,964
I didn't want to talk about this
until later. It's...

58
00:03:27,881 --> 00:03:30,349
It's just not working out
between the two of us.

59
00:03:30,634 --> 00:03:35,105
No, it's not you. It's me. I just don't
feel the same way about us anymore.

60
00:03:35,472 --> 00:03:38,430
But things were going so well.
What happened?

61
00:03:38,725 --> 00:03:41,717
Nothing happened.
We've had a wonderful time together.

62
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:44,170
It's just run its course.

63
00:03:45,774 --> 00:03:47,127
I'm sorry.

64
00:03:50,237 --> 00:03:51,955
I'm sorry, too.

65
00:03:52,197 --> 00:03:56,270
- I hope we can still be friends.
- Yes, I'd like that, too.

66
00:03:57,119 --> 00:03:59,269
Seeing as how we're friends and all,

67
00:03:59,538 --> 00:04:03,417
there's no reason we shouldn't
enjoy what's sure to be a splendid meal.

68
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,344
- Absolutely.
- Great. OK.

69
00:04:10,424 --> 00:04:13,063
- Your first course.
- Thank you.

70
00:04:14,886 --> 00:04:17,639
- How many more courses are there?
- Six, sir.

71
00:04:17,931 --> 00:04:20,365
Could you bring those all at once?

72
00:04:26,064 --> 00:04:28,862
Good Lord. Look at this headline.

73
00:04:31,153 --> 00:04:33,713
"Martin Crane Dead".

74
00:04:33,989 --> 00:04:36,025
You don't need much coffee after that.

75
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,873
58. Poor guy. Hardly had a life.

76
00:04:40,162 --> 00:04:42,960
- Handsome fellow.
- Yeah. Multi-millionaire.

77
00:04:43,248 --> 00:04:48,561
Decorated war hero. Wrote a spy novel.
"Survived by his wife Florence,

78
00:04:48,962 --> 00:04:53,240
a former Miss Washington and
two sons, Joe, a Marine Corps colonel,

79
00:04:53,592 --> 00:04:56,584
and professional baseball player
Mickey Crane".

80
00:04:58,722 --> 00:05:02,431
Nothing like starting the day off
jealous of a dead guy.

81
00:05:04,853 --> 00:05:07,287
- Hello, all.
- Morning, Dr Crane.

82
00:05:07,564 --> 00:05:11,398
- You were up and out early today.
- I felt like taking a walk.

83
00:05:11,735 --> 00:05:14,169
Got a lot on my mind.
Picked up some pastries.

84
00:05:14,446 --> 00:05:18,837
Whatever it is, you'll cheer up when you
see these photos from your ski weekend.

85
00:05:19,993 --> 00:05:24,509
I admit, I took a peek. I must say,
this Sam ofyours is quite a catch.

86
00:05:24,873 --> 00:05:27,706
She's gorgeous, smart, stylish...

87
00:05:28,001 --> 00:05:30,640
- We broke up last night.
- Orange juice, anyone?

88
00:05:32,089 --> 00:05:36,162
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- It was a mutual decision.

89
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:39,980
A little more mutual
on her part than mine.

90
00:05:40,305 --> 00:05:42,944
Once she dumped me,
I jumped right on board.

91
00:05:44,142 --> 00:05:47,418
- Anyway, I'll be fine, Dad.
- Just put it all behind you.

92
00:05:47,729 --> 00:05:51,927
Exactly. I must admit, I'm having
a little difficulty achieving closure.

93
00:05:52,275 --> 00:05:55,426
Sam said that herfeelings changed
for no reason.

94
00:05:55,737 --> 00:05:59,332
I think it might have been
something specific about me.

95
00:05:59,658 --> 00:06:02,934
- Don't make this your fault.
- She's probably telling the truth.

96
00:06:03,245 --> 00:06:07,397
If she's trying to spare your feelings,
it'll be "It's not you, it's me".

97
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:12,231
- That's exactly what she said.
- Waffles, anyone?

98
00:06:12,546 --> 00:06:16,505
You always look for explanations
but sometimes there isn't one.

99
00:06:16,842 --> 00:06:20,676
I know, Dad.
It's going to drive me crazy.

100
00:06:21,346 --> 00:06:24,895
Until I know why it ended,
I'll assume it was any number of things.

101
00:06:25,225 --> 00:06:28,774
- My self-confidence will be shattered.
- You got two choices.

102
00:06:29,104 --> 00:06:31,459
You can spend days
trying to figure it out.

103
00:06:31,732 --> 00:06:34,565
Or you can make a clean break,
never talk to her again,

104
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,851
and get on with your life.

105
00:06:40,407 --> 00:06:43,558
That's exactly what I should do.
Thank you.

106
00:06:43,869 --> 00:06:47,418
- No problem.
- Sometimes you're very insightful.

107
00:06:47,748 --> 00:06:49,864
I've been around the block a few times.

108
00:06:52,252 --> 00:06:56,006
- So when are you going to talk to her?
- Right after my waffles.

109
00:07:06,266 --> 00:07:11,386
Sam! What are the chances?
You've found my thinking place.

110
00:07:11,772 --> 00:07:15,287
Frasier, listen,
I'm ten minutes late for a deposition.

111
00:07:15,609 --> 00:07:18,442
- We can walk and talk.
- All right.

112
00:07:19,696 --> 00:07:23,894
I love our new arrangement. This being
friends thing's going to work out great.

113
00:07:24,242 --> 00:07:27,632
Could you pick up the pace a little?

114
00:07:27,954 --> 00:07:30,388
- How have you been?
- I just saw you last night.

115
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:32,657
Now that you bring up last night...

116
00:07:32,918 --> 00:07:37,434
You do walk fast.
I was hoping for a little clarification.

117
00:07:37,798 --> 00:07:39,868
This has nothing to do with you.

118
00:07:40,133 --> 00:07:43,967
Yes, but it seems highly unlikely
that such a sudden change

119
00:07:44,304 --> 00:07:46,864
could have nothing to do with me.

120
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:50,450
Maybe itwas something
that I did unintentionally.

121
00:07:50,769 --> 00:07:53,203
I'm not sure. Sorry. My fault.

122
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,631
Something this weekend maybe?
I played the piano too long,

123
00:07:56,942 --> 00:07:59,820
but who knew General Schwarzkopf
loved show tunes?

124
00:08:00,112 --> 00:08:03,070
All right.
There's nothing I'm not telling you.

125
00:08:03,365 --> 00:08:07,199
Sometimes things just end.
Please try not to take it so personally.

126
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:10,656
- All right.
- Look, I really am late.

127
00:08:10,914 --> 00:08:12,950
I'll talk to you soon, OK?

128
00:08:14,251 --> 00:08:16,162
Take care.

129
00:08:21,258 --> 00:08:23,249
What's the matter with you?

130
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:25,501
That's just it.

131
00:08:25,762 --> 00:08:27,753
I don't know.

132
00:08:32,436 --> 00:08:35,951
Where is Frasier? He knows we have
reservations at Bavetta's.

133
00:08:36,273 --> 00:08:40,630
Ifyou're late, they make you sit
in the kitchen with the owner's mother.

134
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:46,567
What did I do with that remote?
Daph, are you sure you haven't seen it?

135
00:08:46,908 --> 00:08:51,026
- Positive.
- They ought to make one with a sensor.

136
00:08:51,371 --> 00:08:54,329
20 feet from the TV and it beeps.

137
00:08:54,624 --> 00:08:59,573
Or for a deaf person, they could make
one with purple smoke coming out of it

138
00:08:59,963 --> 00:09:02,602
Iike some kind
of flare system or something.

139
00:09:02,883 --> 00:09:05,397
Please!
You've got to get out of the house more.

140
00:09:09,264 --> 00:09:12,017
Hello, all.
Niles, what a pleasant surprise.

141
00:09:12,309 --> 00:09:15,346
Just what Mama Bavetta will say
when we pull up a chair.

142
00:09:15,646 --> 00:09:17,955
Dinner. I completely forgot.

143
00:09:18,231 --> 00:09:21,064
I took a long walk after work.
I'm sorry, Niles.

144
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,510
It must have slipped my mind.

145
00:09:23,779 --> 00:09:26,657
You're still consumed
with the Sam situation?

146
00:09:26,948 --> 00:09:30,463
- Trying to figure out what happened.
- The relationship ended.

147
00:09:30,786 --> 00:09:33,141
- There's got to be a reason.
- You're fixated.

148
00:09:33,413 --> 00:09:36,883
I am not. That is fixated.
Dad, what are you doing?

149
00:09:38,085 --> 00:09:42,317
This is stupid. Maybe if I stick
together about ten chopsticks,

150
00:09:42,673 --> 00:09:44,868
put a rubber tip on the end
for gripping.

151
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,671
- Hello.
- Be ready in a sec, Roz.

152
00:09:51,932 --> 00:09:55,561
- The movie doesn't start till eight.
- I forgot you two had plans.

153
00:09:55,894 --> 00:09:57,885
I was wondering...

154
00:09:58,146 --> 00:10:00,376
No, I don't know
why Sam broke up with you.

155
00:10:00,649 --> 00:10:03,846
Just like I didn't know two hours ago.
Just like Gil, Bulldog

156
00:10:04,152 --> 00:10:08,668
and Miss Judyfrom
the Arts and Crafts Hour didn't know.

157
00:10:09,032 --> 00:10:12,547
Never hurts to ask.
Miss Judy had some real insights

158
00:10:12,869 --> 00:10:15,702
before she had to make her
Popsicle stick run.

159
00:10:15,998 --> 00:10:21,948
- I'm going to watch the game at Duke's.
- Wait. I'd like to ask a favour.

160
00:10:22,379 --> 00:10:24,415
In the spirit of self-improvement,

161
00:10:24,673 --> 00:10:27,745
I'd like you to tell me
in your own words

162
00:10:28,051 --> 00:10:31,646
what about me you find unlovable.

163
00:10:34,641 --> 00:10:39,920
Please, honestly, for the sake
of my future relationships.

164
00:10:40,314 --> 00:10:42,703
I know you're afraid
to hurt my feelings,

165
00:10:42,983 --> 00:10:45,895
but I can stand
a little constructive criticism.

166
00:10:46,194 --> 00:10:49,072
Tell me, what do you
think are my main faults?

167
00:10:49,364 --> 00:10:52,481
Let's start with this.
You analyse everything to death.

168
00:10:52,784 --> 00:10:56,413
Sam said it wasn't your fault,
but you keep digging around

169
00:10:56,747 --> 00:10:58,738
until you drive everybody nuts.

170
00:10:58,999 --> 00:11:01,911
Dad thinks I am over-analytical.

171
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:04,440
That's great.
OK, who's next? Niles?

172
00:11:04,713 --> 00:11:07,432
I'm not sure
how useful this exercise is.

173
00:11:07,716 --> 00:11:10,071
- You're going to participate.
- Pushy.

174
00:11:10,344 --> 00:11:13,495
Yes, if that's what it takes to...
Oh, thank you.

175
00:11:15,974 --> 00:11:18,488
Daphne, it's your turn. Don't be shy.

176
00:11:18,769 --> 00:11:23,126
Well, if I had to choose,
I'd say you are a bit of a fussbudget.

177
00:11:23,482 --> 00:11:28,078
Ifyou don't mind this substitution,
"demanding" is more le motjuste.

178
00:11:28,445 --> 00:11:31,562
- Pretentious.
- Right. Now see, this is very good.

179
00:11:31,865 --> 00:11:33,184
Roz?

180
00:11:33,408 --> 00:11:38,084
- You're a little full of yourself.
- Great. OK. Pompous.

181
00:11:38,455 --> 00:11:40,810
And you do tend to ramble on
with the callers.

182
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:43,438
- Tad loquacious.
- Pretentious.

183
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:46,941
- Dad, I already wrote that down.
- Underline it.

184
00:11:54,179 --> 00:11:56,693
- Snippy.
- Sarcastic.

185
00:11:56,974 --> 00:11:58,327
- Bossy.
- Huffy.

186
00:11:58,558 --> 00:12:00,310
- Vain.
- That's a good one.

187
00:12:02,396 --> 00:12:07,675
How nice. We finally found an activity
we can all enjoy together.

188
00:12:08,068 --> 00:12:10,138
Why don't you
admit what you're doing?

189
00:12:10,404 --> 00:12:12,918
This isn't a
"help me be a better person" thing.

190
00:12:13,198 --> 00:12:15,507
You're trying to win Sam back.

191
00:12:15,784 --> 00:12:19,094
- That's preposterous.
- Look who you're talking to.

192
00:12:19,413 --> 00:12:22,962
I've been down this road so many times
they call it the Roz Expressway.

193
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:27,330
I've heard that phrase before,
but in a slightly different context.

194
00:12:32,134 --> 00:12:35,922
Maybe there is some truth
in what you say.

195
00:12:36,263 --> 00:12:40,142
I mean, after all,
Sam is really quite a catch.

196
00:12:40,475 --> 00:12:42,466
Why wouldn't I want to get her back?

197
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:46,721
But you shouldn't change yourself
just to please her. It's not healthy,

198
00:12:47,065 --> 00:12:50,455
and it doesn't work. If it did,
Steve Wilson would be my husband

199
00:12:50,777 --> 00:12:54,770
and not just some name
tattooed on my butt.

200
00:12:55,115 --> 00:12:57,834
The best thing you can do is nothing.

201
00:12:58,118 --> 00:13:00,348
Let her think about what she's missing.

202
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:04,932
I totally agree. No candy. No flowers.
And whatever you do, don't call.

203
00:13:05,917 --> 00:13:09,193
Nothing wrong with
keeping the lines of communication open.

204
00:13:09,504 --> 00:13:13,816
- You called, didn't you?
- I left a carefully worded message.

205
00:13:14,176 --> 00:13:17,009
You never call.
It makes you look desperate.

206
00:13:17,304 --> 00:13:20,694
I didn't have any choice.
She wouldn't return any of my pages.

207
00:13:25,646 --> 00:13:29,480
- I've blown it, haven't l?
- What did you say on your message?

208
00:13:29,816 --> 00:13:33,172
Nothing undignified. Of course,
tone ofvoice is everything.

209
00:13:33,487 --> 00:13:35,125
I should play them for you.

210
00:13:35,364 --> 00:13:38,276
- You have her access code?
- Yes, I set it up with her.

211
00:13:38,575 --> 00:13:41,328
I gave her an easy to remember code.
My birthday.

212
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,895
What's so easy about May 7th?

213
00:13:44,164 --> 00:13:46,883
I wouldn't know, Dad.
My birthday's in March.

214
00:13:48,293 --> 00:13:51,251
That's right. The 7th.
That's Eddie's.

215
00:13:52,923 --> 00:13:57,474
Here we go. All right, now, listen and
tell me ifyou think I sound desperate.

216
00:13:59,096 --> 00:14:02,293
Hi, Sam. Two quick things:
dinner at L'Escalieris now at 8.30

217
00:14:02,599 --> 00:14:06,478
and the judge needs to see you at nine
tomorrow morning, not ten. Bye.

218
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:09,849
- Not desperate, feminine.
- Shut up, Niles.

219
00:14:11,441 --> 00:14:15,116
Hello, Sam. It's Frasier.
Give me a call ifyou get a chance. Bye.

220
00:14:15,445 --> 00:14:17,834
You don't sound desperate at all.

221
00:14:18,115 --> 00:14:22,711
Hi, Sam. I'll be at the office.
Call me. It's Frasier.

222
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:26,054
Maybe just a whiff of desperation.

223
00:14:27,457 --> 00:14:30,369
Hi, I'm at the office now.

224
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:32,899
Still at the office.

225
00:14:33,171 --> 00:14:36,800
I stepped out to the coffee machine.
Thought I might have missed you.

226
00:14:37,134 --> 00:14:39,568
How quickly a whiff becomes a stench.

227
00:14:40,429 --> 00:14:42,420
They just get worse after that.

228
00:14:42,723 --> 00:14:45,237
- There's more?
- Yes, not any more, though.

229
00:14:45,517 --> 00:14:49,146
- There. Messages erased.
- Your messages weren't the only ones.

230
00:14:49,479 --> 00:14:52,516
What about the one
about the meeting with the judge?

231
00:14:52,816 --> 00:14:56,855
- You're right.
- What are you going to do about it?

232
00:14:57,195 --> 00:14:59,425
I could call saying
I erased that message

233
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:01,689
while erasing messages I left earlier.

234
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:06,869
- With her secret access code.
- Oh, God, this is humiliating.

235
00:15:07,247 --> 00:15:11,206
I hate to appear unsupportive, but
I've got to get to Duke's for the game.

236
00:15:11,543 --> 00:15:15,456
- And we'll be late for that movie.
- Wait. I forgot my purse.

237
00:15:15,797 --> 00:15:19,676
Don't worry about it, Frasier.
You'll be fine. You'll bounce back.

238
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:22,126
- You're tough.
- And resourceful.

239
00:15:22,387 --> 00:15:24,105
- Resilient.
- Optimistic.

240
00:15:24,348 --> 00:15:25,986
- Tenacious.
- Conceited.

241
00:15:26,224 --> 00:15:28,021
Different list, Daph.

242
00:15:29,186 --> 00:15:31,859
See you all.

243
00:15:32,147 --> 00:15:36,106
Hard to believe this picture was taken
only three days ago.

244
00:15:37,694 --> 00:15:40,254
Look at us. How happy I was.

245
00:15:41,198 --> 00:15:43,189
Now I'll never see her again.

246
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:46,681
Aren't you over-dramatising?
You're bound to run into her.

247
00:15:46,995 --> 00:15:50,510
No, I was talking about
me and Lesley Stahl.

248
00:15:50,832 --> 00:15:53,300
Looking at these photos,
I can't help noticing

249
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:55,894
there are very few
ofyou and Sam together.

250
00:15:56,171 --> 00:15:59,049
- What are you getting at?
- I'm just wondering how much

251
00:15:59,341 --> 00:16:03,539
- you really feel for this woman.
- I haven't felt this way in ages.

252
00:16:03,887 --> 00:16:06,321
I'm sorry. Guess I was wrong.
It's love then.

253
00:16:07,683 --> 00:16:13,474
I don't know about love. I mean, we've
only been seeing each other for a month.

254
00:16:13,897 --> 00:16:16,092
But you could fall in love with her.

255
00:16:16,358 --> 00:16:17,632
Possibly.

256
00:16:17,859 --> 00:16:20,692
- Sometime down the line.
- Yes. Perhaps.

257
00:16:20,988 --> 00:16:22,979
Well, no wonder you're heartbroken.

258
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:26,312
You've just lost the only woman
you could even possibly,

259
00:16:26,618 --> 00:16:30,691
sometime down the line,
perhaps fall in love with.

260
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:35,078
I'm surprised the country music people
haven't jumped all over this one.

261
00:16:41,425 --> 00:16:44,098
So I don't rhapsodise about her.

262
00:16:44,386 --> 00:16:47,219
You did rhapsodise
when she tookyou to Cigare Volant

263
00:16:47,514 --> 00:16:50,950
and you were seated in a secret
VlP room we never knew existed.

264
00:16:51,268 --> 00:16:55,022
Are you suggesting I'm so shallow
I was with her for her connections?

265
00:16:55,355 --> 00:16:59,587
Let's face it, you've always had
a yearning to run with the cool kids,

266
00:16:59,943 --> 00:17:03,982
and it's never worked out for you.
Your one day on the football team.

267
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:08,736
The summer you bought a motorcycle.
Although...

268
00:17:09,036 --> 00:17:12,028
It's only a moped ifyou pedal it,
and I never pedalled.

269
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:17,977
I just wonder ifwhat you're mourning
isn't so much the loss of Sam

270
00:17:18,295 --> 00:17:21,253
as the loss of her celebrity lifestyle.

271
00:17:21,548 --> 00:17:25,063
I must admit things never
did seem quite right between us.

272
00:17:25,385 --> 00:17:29,503
If it hadn't been for her friends, l
probably would've broken it off myself.

273
00:17:29,848 --> 00:17:33,045
- Shame on me.
- Don't punish yourself, Frasier.

274
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:36,389
At least you're deep enough
to realise you're shallow.

275
00:17:40,108 --> 00:17:42,099
- Dinner?
- Let's.

276
00:17:42,611 --> 00:17:45,728
Although I've still
got to phone her about that message.

277
00:17:46,031 --> 00:17:50,070
Why don't we stop by L'Escalier
on our way? You can tell her in person.

278
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:53,925
Even better. Niles, I can't tell
you how helpful this has been.

279
00:17:54,247 --> 00:17:56,238
How can I ever repay you?

280
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,173
You can get me
into that VlP room at Cigare Volant.

281
00:17:59,461 --> 00:18:02,339
Where is the entrance?
Behind the cigarette machine?

282
00:18:02,631 --> 00:18:06,021
No, that's just a decoy. It's through
the dry-cleaner next door.

283
00:18:13,892 --> 00:18:15,883
- Hello, Sam.
- Frasier.

284
00:18:16,144 --> 00:18:18,897
- I know you didn't expect to see me.
- No.

285
00:18:19,189 --> 00:18:22,306
Of course, after those messages,
I can't say I'm surprised.

286
00:18:22,609 --> 00:18:24,281
You heard them?

287
00:18:24,528 --> 00:18:27,725
I checked my machine.
Frasier, we really need to talk.

288
00:18:28,031 --> 00:18:32,661
No, we don't. I promise you,
I will never call you again.

289
00:18:33,036 --> 00:18:35,948
I've thought about it and
you made the right decision.

290
00:18:36,248 --> 00:18:39,206
- No, I didn't.
- Excuse me?

291
00:18:39,501 --> 00:18:43,699
Please, sit down. I was going
to call you later anyway.

292
00:18:44,047 --> 00:18:48,563
You see, I think I figured out
what happened between the two of us.

293
00:18:48,927 --> 00:18:51,725
I panicked.
I was starting to really care about you,

294
00:18:52,014 --> 00:18:56,007
thought we might have a future even
and, well, it scared me.

295
00:18:56,351 --> 00:18:59,423
But the way you've pursued me,
showing up at the courthouse,

296
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:03,359
and leaving all of those messages.
Well, and now you're here.

297
00:19:03,692 --> 00:19:08,129
Obviously you feel just as strongly
as I do. It's funny really.

298
00:19:08,488 --> 00:19:12,447
Both of us falling in love and not
realising the other felt the same way.

299
00:19:12,784 --> 00:19:14,012
We should be laughing.

300
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:25,445
Listen, Sam...

301
00:19:25,672 --> 00:19:29,028
No. I'm going to tell you what
we'll be doing this weekend.

302
00:19:29,343 --> 00:19:33,973
We are taking the Concorde to London
for a party at Alec Guinness' place.

303
00:19:34,348 --> 00:19:37,226
Well, I'm not so sure...
Sir Alec Guinness?

304
00:19:37,517 --> 00:19:41,112
I know it's a long way to go,
but Stephen is going to be there

305
00:19:41,438 --> 00:19:43,827
and he'll play some songs
from the new one.

306
00:19:44,107 --> 00:19:46,621
I don't know if...
Stephen Sondheim?

307
00:19:46,902 --> 00:19:50,861
- Guess who's singing with him.
- No, please, don't tell me. Please.

308
00:19:51,198 --> 00:19:54,554
Frasier, what is it?
You seem upset.

309
00:19:57,663 --> 00:19:59,813
Sam, I can't see you anymore.

310
00:20:00,082 --> 00:20:01,197
What?

311
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:07,048
You're an incredible woman,
but I've come to a realisation about us.

312
00:20:07,464 --> 00:20:11,537
Well, about me.
And I just don't see any future for us.

313
00:20:11,885 --> 00:20:15,082
I know it sounds strange
after the way I was pursuing you,

314
00:20:15,389 --> 00:20:18,745
but I've been in it
for all the wrong reasons.

315
00:20:19,059 --> 00:20:23,849
- Like what?
- I'm not very proud of this but

316
00:20:24,231 --> 00:20:28,270
maybe I was a little dazzled
by the circle you travel in.

317
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:32,125
So you were with me just so you could be
around some famous people?

318
00:20:32,447 --> 00:20:35,917
- I was fond ofyou as well.
- Fond of me? Thank you very much.

319
00:20:36,243 --> 00:20:39,121
I understand you're upset
and I'm going to go.

320
00:20:39,413 --> 00:20:41,290
I don't believe this. My friends.

321
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:46,409
Look, I know it's shallow and it's
something I'm going to have to work on.

322
00:20:46,795 --> 00:20:50,470
- Hi, Sam. How are you?
- Lesley. Hello.

323
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:53,267
It's Frasier Crane. We met this weekend.

324
00:20:53,552 --> 00:20:57,943
- How are you?
- What kind of sick bastard are you?

325
00:20:59,182 --> 00:21:01,537
You're right.
We're having a bit of a spat,

326
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:05,883
but of course I don't need to tell you
being the ace reporter that you are.

327
00:21:06,231 --> 00:21:08,791
Just get out of here right now.

328
00:21:09,067 --> 00:21:12,264
- Maybe we could have lunch.
- Get out.

329
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:15,324
What's the matter with me?

330
00:21:15,615 --> 00:21:17,367
Lesley...
