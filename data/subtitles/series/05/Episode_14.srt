1
00:00:09,708 --> 00:00:12,222
-Hello, Niles.
- Frasier, listen to this.

2
00:00:12,502 --> 00:00:15,175
"Michael Hawkins
of Allentown, Pennsylvania,

3
00:00:15,464 --> 00:00:18,900
has donated his right lung
to his younger brother, Clovis."

4
00:00:19,218 --> 00:00:22,972
"Says Hawkins, 'l got two lungs,
but I only got one brother'."

5
00:00:23,305 --> 00:00:27,662
Isn't that something? The
love one brother feels for the other.

6
00:00:28,018 --> 00:00:30,009
What do you want?

7
00:00:30,562 --> 00:00:33,440
I need you to come
to a dog show with me.

8
00:00:33,732 --> 00:00:36,200
I would rather give you a lung.

9
00:00:36,485 --> 00:00:38,760
- Latte, please.
- Frasier, I beg you.

10
00:00:39,029 --> 00:00:43,102
It's at the Seattle Kennel Club
tomorrow night and Maris will be there.

11
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:46,362
In what class will Maris be showing?

12
00:00:48,163 --> 00:00:50,393
She'll be showing no class.

13
00:00:50,666 --> 00:00:53,658
As she has ever since
she hooked up with Dr Schenkman.

14
00:00:53,961 --> 00:00:57,192
It's my first time seeing them
since we filed for divorce.

15
00:00:57,506 --> 00:00:59,462
Here's an idea, Niles. Don't go.

16
00:00:59,716 --> 00:01:04,585
If I don't go people will think I've
let Maris and Schenkman intimidate me.

17
00:01:04,972 --> 00:01:08,965
I want to prove that I'm strong and
independent and I can't do that alone.

18
00:01:12,563 --> 00:01:15,953
All right. If it's moral support
you need, I'll go with you.

19
00:01:16,275 --> 00:01:19,665
I'll pick you up around eight.
And I have a patient. Thank you.

20
00:01:20,153 --> 00:01:23,429
I knew I could count on you.
Some things never change.

21
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:26,015
Do you know where I can get
a cheap hotel room?

22
00:01:26,285 --> 00:01:28,276
Case in point. Goodbye, Roz.

23
00:01:29,454 --> 00:01:31,888
Why do you need a hotel room?

24
00:01:32,165 --> 00:01:36,044
They're still painting my new place.
I can't be around those fumes.

25
00:01:36,378 --> 00:01:38,414
And they've rented my old apartment.

26
00:01:38,672 --> 00:01:41,425
Grande decaf latte, please.
I am on the street.

27
00:01:41,717 --> 00:01:46,268
You ordered a $4 cup of coffee.
"On the street" may be a tad dramatic.

28
00:01:46,638 --> 00:01:49,789
I've got to call around,
see if I can find something.

29
00:01:51,518 --> 00:01:55,636
Dad is going to San Francisco for the
weekend. You could always stay with me.

30
00:01:55,981 --> 00:02:00,213
That would sure make things easier. OK.

31
00:02:00,569 --> 00:02:03,879
Well, then, that's settled.
That's that, then.

32
00:02:04,197 --> 00:02:07,234
You didn't really
expect me to take you up on it.

33
00:02:07,534 --> 00:02:11,322
No. I wouldn't have offered
if it wasn't something I wanted to do.

34
00:02:11,663 --> 00:02:14,700
- All right.
- Here you go. And there's your check.

35
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,275
- I'll get that.
- No, let me get that.

36
00:02:17,544 --> 00:02:18,943
OK, thanks.

37
00:02:19,171 --> 00:02:21,924
Lucky me.
I'm getting everything I want today.

38
00:02:26,762 --> 00:02:28,912
- It's about time.
- Calm down, Dad.

39
00:02:29,181 --> 00:02:32,491
I was getting worried.
My plane leaves at five o'clock.

40
00:02:32,809 --> 00:02:35,403
- Your blood pressure medicine.
- I don't need it.

41
00:02:35,687 --> 00:02:37,678
Pack it anyway!

42
00:02:39,733 --> 00:02:42,327
What's this? Earrings?

43
00:02:42,611 --> 00:02:47,002
I picked them up for Daphne at the
drug store. She ran some errands for me.

44
00:02:47,366 --> 00:02:50,881
- Nice. Are they sapphires?
- Yes. I always buy precious stones

45
00:02:51,203 --> 00:02:54,912
at the same counter where I pick up
corn pads and Wart-Be-Gone.

46
00:02:55,249 --> 00:02:59,447
- Shouldn't you be going?
- There's something I want to give you.

47
00:02:59,795 --> 00:03:02,229
A token of my appreciation.

48
00:03:02,506 --> 00:03:06,215
- Dr Crane, you remembered.
- Of course I did.

49
00:03:06,552 --> 00:03:10,147
Can you believe it was five years ago
today that I came to work here?

50
00:03:10,472 --> 00:03:14,351
I knew you wouldn't let an important
occasion like this go by unnoticed.

51
00:03:14,685 --> 00:03:17,836
- But I wasn't expecting a gift.
- Well, it's a tiny gift.

52
00:03:18,146 --> 00:03:20,216
Oh, my God! Sapphires.

53
00:03:22,401 --> 00:03:25,598
- Actually, Daphne...
- These must have cost a fortune.

54
00:03:25,904 --> 00:03:28,577
My friend Molly got a diamond bracelet
from her boss

55
00:03:28,866 --> 00:03:32,541
but she worked for him for ten years
and she was sleeping with him.

56
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:35,782
I got sapphires and
I didn't even have to sleep with you.

57
00:03:36,081 --> 00:03:39,517
Although now that I've got
the sapphires... What am I saying?

58
00:03:39,835 --> 00:03:41,826
Is it rude if I go and try these on?

59
00:03:42,087 --> 00:03:45,363
I have to see what they look like.
I've never had real jewellery.

60
00:03:45,674 --> 00:03:47,232
I'm speechless.

61
00:03:49,845 --> 00:03:53,804
Dear God,
she believes they're genuine sapphires.

62
00:03:54,141 --> 00:03:59,977
- You think?
- I'll have to tell her the truth.

63
00:04:00,397 --> 00:04:03,150
Why? Didn'tyou see how happy she was?

64
00:04:03,442 --> 00:04:06,161
I can't let herthink
I gave her something I didn't.

65
00:04:06,445 --> 00:04:09,642
Honesty between friends
is far more precious than any gem.

66
00:04:09,948 --> 00:04:13,543
I feel like a princess.
I'm never going to take them off.

67
00:04:13,869 --> 00:04:15,621
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

68
00:04:18,498 --> 00:04:21,410
You even remembered
that sapphires are my birthstone.

69
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:26,181
- There's no end to your thoughtfulness.
- Somebody has to keep track.

70
00:04:26,548 --> 00:04:29,779
- I should be getting to the airport.
- I'll get my keys.

71
00:04:30,093 --> 00:04:32,653
No, absolutely not. I'll drive Mr Crane.

72
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:37,003
You're not lifting a finger. You ring
for the elevator, I'll grab me coat.

73
00:04:37,351 --> 00:04:40,980
My flight's at five. They told me
to get there an hour early.

74
00:04:42,147 --> 00:04:45,742
- Did you pack your medicine?
- Yes, but I told you, I don't need it.

75
00:04:46,443 --> 00:04:49,355
- Hey, guys.
- Frasier, help her with that stuff.

76
00:04:49,655 --> 00:04:52,453
- Thanks for letting me use your room.
- No problem.

77
00:04:52,741 --> 00:04:55,209
So you're off to San Francisco?

78
00:04:55,494 --> 00:04:57,928
Duke and l
took our shore leave there in '52.

79
00:04:58,205 --> 00:05:01,561
- Going to re-trace our steps.
- Sure sounds like fun.

80
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:07,313
We had a great time. No place like
'Frisco for a guy cruising the streets

81
00:05:07,714 --> 00:05:10,592
Iooking for a good time.

82
00:05:10,884 --> 00:05:15,082
You know, Dad, I think you'll find that
'Frisco hasn't changed all that much.

83
00:05:16,515 --> 00:05:19,154
Well, I hope not. Bye.

84
00:05:19,434 --> 00:05:22,949
Hey, Roz. Just off to the airport.
Back in a bit. See you later.

85
00:05:23,272 --> 00:05:25,627
Come in. You're earlier than I expected.

86
00:05:25,899 --> 00:05:29,938
I had to get out sooner than I thought.
I left you a message.

87
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:32,668
I didn't check my machine
all day today.

88
00:05:32,948 --> 00:05:37,658
Thank you so much for this.
You won't even know I'm here.

89
00:05:38,036 --> 00:05:40,630
You have 13 messages.

90
00:05:41,665 --> 00:05:44,975
I had my calls forwarded.
I hope you don't mind.

91
00:05:46,461 --> 00:05:47,894
Hey, Roz, it's Marco.

92
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:52,328
I'm coming to town. Are you busy
Saturday night... Iate? Call me.

93
00:05:52,676 --> 00:05:56,464
Obviously Marco and I haven't talked
for a long time.

94
00:05:56,805 --> 00:06:00,002
Something tells me
you never talked for a long time.

95
00:06:00,309 --> 00:06:04,985
Roz? This is Paula Garrett, Rick's mom.
We just found out about the baby,

96
00:06:05,355 --> 00:06:07,949
and we think it's important to meet you.

97
00:06:08,233 --> 00:06:11,270
We're seeing Rick in Paris
day after tomorrow,

98
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:13,686
so any time before then would be fine.

99
00:06:13,947 --> 00:06:16,984
I'm running out now.
Maybe I'll try you later.

100
00:06:17,701 --> 00:06:20,010
Oh, my God. What do they want?

101
00:06:20,287 --> 00:06:23,484
They want to meet you.
They are your child's grandparents.

102
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:27,146
I worked this out with Rick.
He's 20 years old, still in college

103
00:06:27,461 --> 00:06:30,180
and it's best
if I raise this baby by myself.

104
00:06:30,464 --> 00:06:33,774
I've got to put up with in-laws
and I don't even have a husband.

105
00:06:34,092 --> 00:06:38,802
That's like posing nude for your art
teacher and still flunking the course.

106
00:06:39,181 --> 00:06:41,695
Shut up, I needed the credit.

107
00:06:43,936 --> 00:06:47,406
- All they want is a short meeting.
- That's what they say now.

108
00:06:47,731 --> 00:06:50,199
What ifthey want another one
after that?

109
00:06:50,484 --> 00:06:52,759
What if they don't think
I'm a fit mother?

110
00:06:53,028 --> 00:06:55,667
What if they're nice, supportive people?

111
00:06:55,948 --> 00:07:00,180
I just don't want to do this, Frasier.
It's not comfortable.

112
00:07:01,912 --> 00:07:02,901
Roz...

113
00:07:05,123 --> 00:07:09,480
I could go with you... ifyou like.

114
00:07:09,836 --> 00:07:13,033
Better yet, we could have them here
tomorrow night.

115
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:17,049
Niles and I have that dog show at eight.
They could come before that.

116
00:07:17,386 --> 00:07:18,739
I don't know.

117
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:21,246
- I'll be that's Mrs Garrett.
- I'm not here.

118
00:07:23,308 --> 00:07:28,428
Hello? Yes, she is.
Yes, she did get your message.

119
00:07:30,482 --> 00:07:34,191
No, I'm afraid
she won't be able to meet you.

120
00:07:37,114 --> 00:07:40,902
Yes, I understand that you're upset.
I'm terribly sorry.

121
00:07:41,243 --> 00:07:43,199
Goodbye.

122
00:07:43,453 --> 00:07:45,330
Thank you, Frasier. Thank you.

123
00:07:45,581 --> 00:07:48,812
That was Marco.
Now we're calling Mrs Garrett.

124
00:07:52,379 --> 00:07:56,497
All right, give it to me straight.
How do I look?

125
00:07:59,803 --> 00:08:03,432
Like Pollyanna grew up
and got herself in a little trouble.

126
00:08:04,391 --> 00:08:07,303
Why am I doing this?
How did I let you talk me into this?

127
00:08:07,603 --> 00:08:11,516
It will mean a lot to them.
You can learn about your baby's lineage.

128
00:08:11,857 --> 00:08:16,692
A lot ofthings are inherited, you know,
like intelligence, artistic ability...

129
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:21,541
- I've got to check my make-up.
- Roz, this should be fun.

130
00:08:21,909 --> 00:08:24,821
It's like a little preview
ofwho your child might be.

131
00:08:27,956 --> 00:08:30,106
Hi, there. Steve Garrett.

132
00:08:35,172 --> 00:08:38,926
- My wife's just... Honey?
- It was nice seeing you, too.

133
00:08:39,259 --> 00:08:43,935
What a coincidence. Your neighbour
goes to my hair salon. Hi, I'm Paula.

134
00:08:44,306 --> 00:08:46,866
Frasier Crane. Won't you please come in?

135
00:08:48,644 --> 00:08:54,560
Roz will be out in a second.
She just went to powder her... self.

136
00:08:54,983 --> 00:08:59,374
We hope this isn't too awkward for her.
She sounded anxious on the phone.

137
00:08:59,738 --> 00:09:03,253
Who could blame her? She doesn't
know what kind of people we are.

138
00:09:03,575 --> 00:09:07,170
A situation like this is enough
to make anyone a little nervous.

139
00:09:07,496 --> 00:09:09,771
Roz isn't the nervous type.

140
00:09:14,419 --> 00:09:18,173
Roz? This is Steve and Paula Garrett.

141
00:09:20,467 --> 00:09:23,504
We don't blame you for being shocked.

142
00:09:23,804 --> 00:09:27,080
We're used to it.
You should see the looks we get.

143
00:09:27,391 --> 00:09:29,905
You were taken aback,
weren't you, Dr Crane?

144
00:09:30,185 --> 00:09:33,461
- Certainly not.
- Everyone comments on it.

145
00:09:33,772 --> 00:09:36,286
I must admit when I opened the door l...

146
00:09:36,567 --> 00:09:40,526
Couldn't believe we were old enough
to have a 20-year-old son.

147
00:09:42,447 --> 00:09:46,759
Exactly. You know, you both look
so young, don't they, Roz?

148
00:09:51,415 --> 00:09:54,373
Yes, young. Very, very young.

149
00:09:54,668 --> 00:10:00,186
Roz, you're uncomfortable but we have
no intention of intruding on your life.

150
00:10:00,591 --> 00:10:03,230
Rick told us how wonderful you are.

151
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:07,742
We just wanted to offer any help or
support you think is appropriate.

152
00:10:08,098 --> 00:10:10,658
Thanks. That's very nice.

153
00:10:10,934 --> 00:10:13,494
I thought your guests
might be a little peckish.

154
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:16,045
Daphne Moon, Steve and Paula Garrett.

155
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:18,306
Hello, l...

156
00:10:21,904 --> 00:10:26,420
I know, it's amazing.
They are the parents of a 20-year-old.

157
00:10:26,783 --> 00:10:28,933
Amazing.

158
00:10:29,203 --> 00:10:30,192
Excuse me.

159
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:34,310
Niles, you're early.

160
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:37,931
I thought you might want to grab
a bite to eat before the dog show.

161
00:10:38,253 --> 00:10:41,768
I'm sorry,
I didn't realise that you had...

162
00:10:43,342 --> 00:10:46,937
Company. Steve and Paula Garrett,
this is my brother Niles Crane.

163
00:10:47,262 --> 00:10:50,572
The Garretts are the grandparents-to-be
of Roz's baby.

164
00:10:50,891 --> 00:10:53,724
- Nice to meet you.
- Did I hear you mention a dog show?

165
00:10:54,019 --> 00:10:56,772
The Seattle Kennel Club
is having its annual event.

166
00:10:57,064 --> 00:11:02,775
Steve and I went to that a few years
ago. We have two giant Schnauzers.

167
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,235
My goodness, Paula, look at the view.

168
00:11:17,501 --> 00:11:19,890
Roz, show the Garretts the view.

169
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:23,560
That would be nice.
I could use a breath of fresh air.

170
00:11:30,264 --> 00:11:34,382
Just stop it, the two ofyou. You're
acting like a couple of two-year-olds.

171
00:11:36,311 --> 00:11:39,621
- I'm home.
- Dad. What are you doing here?

172
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:43,250
'Frisco was a bust.
All our watering holes are gone.

173
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:45,605
The steakhouse was a sushi bar.

174
00:11:45,863 --> 00:11:48,696
And Duke and I went out for a walk.
We passed City Hall

175
00:11:48,991 --> 00:11:52,188
and there's this big crowd,
like a pep rally or something.

176
00:11:52,494 --> 00:11:56,487
So we joined them. Some official guy
says something that we didn't hear.

177
00:11:56,832 --> 00:12:00,871
Then everybody's throwing rice
and all the men are kissing each other

178
00:12:01,211 --> 00:12:04,362
and all the women are kissing each other
and I'm not sure,

179
00:12:04,673 --> 00:12:06,868
but I think Duke and I may be married.

180
00:12:09,303 --> 00:12:14,093
The whole weekend was like that.
Just one surprising event...

181
00:12:21,565 --> 00:12:27,276
- I'm sorry. Did we startle you?
- No, I didn't know we had company.

182
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:31,340
Dad, this is Steve and Paula Garrett.
They're Rick's parents.

183
00:12:31,658 --> 00:12:34,730
Hi, how are you?
Nice to meet you. Marty Crane.

184
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:38,931
They're just on their way to Paris
to visit Rick.

185
00:12:39,249 --> 00:12:41,126
That sounds like fun.

186
00:12:41,376 --> 00:12:45,847
I'm just a little nervous. I hear
the Parisians can be kind of snooty.

187
00:12:46,798 --> 00:12:49,870
Excuse me.
I've got something in the oven.

188
00:12:50,177 --> 00:12:54,011
- Let me help you.
- Yeah, me, too.

189
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:05,473
We've got to stop. They'll hear us.

190
00:13:05,734 --> 00:13:09,204
- Mmm, what's that I smell?
- Probably Japan.

191
00:13:20,249 --> 00:13:22,558
What is the matter with you people?

192
00:13:22,834 --> 00:13:25,064
Don't say you don't think this is funny?

193
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:30,172
They are two perfectly nice people
who happen to have large noses.

194
00:13:30,551 --> 00:13:32,542
Sniggering like school children.

195
00:13:32,803 --> 00:13:37,274
Ifyou can't get yourself under control,
you can just stay in here.

196
00:13:38,642 --> 00:13:42,271
- Quiche Lorraine, anyone?
- Quiche her? I hardly know her.

197
00:13:44,439 --> 00:13:47,317
- That smells wonderful.
- Does it ever.

198
00:13:50,654 --> 00:13:53,487
Is this homemade or store-bought?

199
00:13:53,782 --> 00:13:58,253
Honey, don't ask that. Pardon my wife.
Sometimes she gets a little nosy.

200
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:01,214
Me nosy? You're the nosy one
in the family.

201
00:14:01,498 --> 00:14:03,693
Anyone who knows you knows you're nosy.

202
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:06,792
Anyone who knows you
knows you're nosier.

203
00:14:11,466 --> 00:14:13,457
Something wrong, Fras?

204
00:14:19,099 --> 00:14:21,215
Quiche her, I hardly know her.

205
00:14:24,646 --> 00:14:27,718
I just... got that.

206
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:40,822
In spite of a shaky beginning,
this evening's turned out rather well.

207
00:14:41,163 --> 00:14:44,599
Yeah. And you were
absolutely right, Frasier.

208
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:48,114
Now I can see some ofthe qualities
my baby can have.

209
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:51,571
A great sense of humour
and a sweet disposition,

210
00:14:51,882 --> 00:14:53,873
a nose like an anteater.

211
00:14:56,345 --> 00:15:01,658
You're making a big deal out of nothing.
Rick had a fine nose. And so do you.

212
00:15:02,059 --> 00:15:04,050
I'm sure your baby will have one, too.

213
00:15:04,311 --> 00:15:08,224
You're right. If Rick can beat
those genes, my baby has a chance.

214
00:15:09,816 --> 00:15:12,011
How long have you been
working for Dr Crane?

215
00:15:12,277 --> 00:15:16,350
Five years yesterday. He gave me
a beautiful pair of sapphire earrings

216
00:15:16,698 --> 00:15:19,451
- to mark the occasion.
- Frasier gave you sapphires?

217
00:15:19,743 --> 00:15:22,462
- Who's for coffee?
- I'll take some.

218
00:15:22,746 --> 00:15:26,785
You must show those earrings to Steve.
He's a jeweller.

219
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:30,674
He could probably even tell you
what mine the stones came from.

220
00:15:31,004 --> 00:15:34,041
Maybe coffee's a bad idea.
You've got that early flight.

221
00:15:34,341 --> 00:15:37,299
Daphne, could you take this
back in the kitchen?

222
00:15:37,594 --> 00:15:40,062
One of me earrings must have fallen off.

223
00:15:40,347 --> 00:15:43,259
- We'll help you find it.
- What does it look like?

224
00:15:43,559 --> 00:15:46,835
Once you've seen one sapphire,
you've seen them all.

225
00:15:47,145 --> 00:15:49,943
That's not true.
They vary widely in quality.

226
00:15:50,232 --> 00:15:53,383
Why don't you just get up
and we have to get going.

227
00:15:53,694 --> 00:15:56,492
We have plenty in here
to form a search party.

228
00:15:56,780 --> 00:16:01,331
- We'll just trample each other.
- We do have a big day tomorrow.

229
00:16:01,702 --> 00:16:04,694
You might as well
get a little sleep before you take off.

230
00:16:04,997 --> 00:16:08,990
I might be able to replace the earring.
Let me see the other one.

231
00:16:09,334 --> 00:16:11,973
I found it. Here it is.
I knew I would. Bon voyage.

232
00:16:12,254 --> 00:16:15,485
- Dr Crane...
- No, Daphne, just a second.

233
00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:18,359
It was wonderful of you to come.

234
00:16:18,635 --> 00:16:21,513
Thank you for having us.
Roz, it was great meeting you.

235
00:16:21,805 --> 00:16:24,114
- Our door is always open.
- Have a great trip.

236
00:16:24,391 --> 00:16:25,824
- Good night.
- Good night.

237
00:16:27,936 --> 00:16:29,927
Can I have it then?

238
00:16:30,188 --> 00:16:34,227
I'm sorry, it was just a piece of lint.
Well, the search continues.

239
00:16:34,568 --> 00:16:38,402
The one precious thing anyone's ever
bought me in my whole stinking life

240
00:16:38,739 --> 00:16:42,049
- and I lose it.
- Daphne, I found it.

241
00:16:42,367 --> 00:16:44,756
Dr Crane, I could kiss you.

242
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:46,026
OK.

243
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,150
- What's this?
- Nothing.

244
00:16:55,589 --> 00:17:01,141
The setting's come loose. It's only blue
on top. The bottom's all coppery.

245
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:02,622
Dr Crane.

246
00:17:02,846 --> 00:17:06,839
I know what you're thinking,
and you are right. Obviously, l...

247
00:17:07,184 --> 00:17:09,903
You've been swindled.
Where did you buy these?

248
00:17:10,187 --> 00:17:14,783
I want to take these back and tell that
lying cheat exactly what I think of him.

249
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:18,699
- Actually, you just did.
- You knew?

250
00:17:19,029 --> 00:17:24,103
- Niles, how about a cup of coffee?
- Thanks, Roz. Cream and sugar.

251
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:33,241
I'm terribly sorry, Daphne.
I actually meant to tell you eventually.

252
00:17:33,627 --> 00:17:36,539
You didn't need to.
Her earlobe's turning green.

253
00:17:39,466 --> 00:17:43,379
Daphne, the truth is
I didn't remember your anniversary.

254
00:17:46,181 --> 00:17:49,730
I saw them and I thought they
were pretty. So I bought them for you

255
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:54,099
and you thought theywere genuine.
You seemed so happy, l...

256
00:17:55,649 --> 00:18:00,200
They are pretty.
I suppose I can have them repaired.

257
00:18:00,571 --> 00:18:03,802
I'll just take them back
to the jewellery store.

258
00:18:10,247 --> 00:18:13,603
Actually, I bought them at Raymond's.

259
00:18:14,877 --> 00:18:17,232
Raymond's Drug Store?

260
00:18:17,504 --> 00:18:21,383
The good news is they'll probably
carry something for that ear infection.

261
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:33,308
I almost forgot.
Roz, I brought you something.

262
00:18:33,604 --> 00:18:37,916
I thought you might get a kick out
of these pictures of Ricky as a boy.

263
00:18:38,275 --> 00:18:40,948
Thank you. That is so nice ofyou.

264
00:18:42,696 --> 00:18:45,449
- Where is he? I don't see him.
- There, in the middle.

265
00:18:48,076 --> 00:18:51,193
- He looks so different.
- That was before his hockey accident.

266
00:18:51,496 --> 00:18:53,566
The nose job changed his whole face.

267
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:58,587
The doctor did a good job, but
that's the Ricky you'll see in the baby.

268
00:19:01,089 --> 00:19:04,604
- Well, thanks.
- You're welcome. And bye again.

269
00:19:04,927 --> 00:19:07,487
- Take care now. Good to see you.
- Thanks.

270
00:19:08,472 --> 00:19:10,190
Oh, my God!

271
00:19:10,432 --> 00:19:13,265
Come on, Roz.
It can't be that bad. Let me see.

272
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:16,028
- No, I'll never hear the end of it.
- Please.

273
00:19:20,943 --> 00:19:22,934
Where is the end of it?

274
00:19:30,494 --> 00:19:33,452
Roz, you're not still looking
at that picture, are you?

275
00:19:33,747 --> 00:19:36,056
No, this is a different one.

276
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,630
Look at the way the ears
on this poor little girl stick out.

277
00:19:42,005 --> 00:19:47,284
It's me. Age nine.
The year before I got them fixed.

278
00:19:47,678 --> 00:19:52,274
Sorry, Roz. I didn't recognise you
with those glasses.

279
00:19:52,641 --> 00:19:56,600
- Why is one side blacked out?
- I had a lazy eye.

280
00:19:59,815 --> 00:20:02,170
I got that fixed the next year.

281
00:20:02,442 --> 00:20:05,991
Let's just say for birthdays,
I wasn't asking for ponies.

282
00:20:06,321 --> 00:20:08,391
You poor thing.

283
00:20:08,657 --> 00:20:12,969
What if my kid gets Rick's nose
and my ears and eyes?

284
00:20:13,328 --> 00:20:16,604
With my grandfather's third nipple,
I might as well pitch a tent

285
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:19,429
and charge admission.

286
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:22,622
Nothing like that's going to happen.

287
00:20:22,921 --> 00:20:25,276
I just hate the idea
of my kid being teased.

288
00:20:27,217 --> 00:20:32,086
I know what that's like. As long as
my baby's in here, I can protect it.

289
00:20:32,472 --> 00:20:36,943
But pretty soon this kid's
going to be out there on his own.

290
00:20:37,311 --> 00:20:41,543
Every child goes through a bit of
teasing. It's part of growing up.

291
00:20:41,899 --> 00:20:45,858
At least yours will have a mother
who understands what it feels like.

292
00:20:46,195 --> 00:20:48,755
And you'll know what to say
to make it better.

293
00:20:49,031 --> 00:20:51,465
I really hadn't thought of it that way.

294
00:20:51,742 --> 00:20:54,336
I'm good at finding
the positive in things.

295
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,929
Look at what happened to me tonight.

296
00:20:57,206 --> 00:20:59,800
I could say I worked for someone
for five years

297
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:04,076
and he forgot my anniversary and bought
me a worthless piece of blue glass.

298
00:21:04,421 --> 00:21:07,777
But I'd rather say
he gave me a nice pair of earrings

299
00:21:08,091 --> 00:21:10,286
just because he thought I'd like them.

300
00:21:10,552 --> 00:21:12,941
Which is sweet when you think about it.

301
00:21:13,222 --> 00:21:17,420
- Frasier will be relieved to hear that.
- I'm not going to tell him.

302
00:21:18,602 --> 00:21:22,390
- I'm ready for bed.
- Yeah, me, too. Thanks again, Daphne.

303
00:21:22,731 --> 00:21:24,483
You're welcome.

304
00:21:24,733 --> 00:21:27,327
I just felt a big kick.

305
00:21:27,611 --> 00:21:29,727
You sure it wasn't a sneeze?

306
00:21:29,988 --> 00:21:32,024
It's the last one. I promise.
