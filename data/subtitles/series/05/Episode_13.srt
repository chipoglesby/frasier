1
00:00:10,292 --> 00:00:13,762
Dear God. It's a minefield out there.

2
00:00:14,087 --> 00:00:17,602
Everyone's talking about
a mini-series I've been watching.

3
00:00:17,925 --> 00:00:20,041
Did you see the end last night when...

4
00:00:20,302 --> 00:00:23,977
I attended a benefit last night. I had
to tape it and I have yet to see it.

5
00:00:24,306 --> 00:00:27,696
Who would've thought it?
Mr PBS watching a trashy mini-series.

6
00:00:28,018 --> 00:00:32,011
It's not trashy. The intricacies
of the plot are downright Dickensian.

7
00:00:32,356 --> 00:00:34,745
Yeah, Angie Dickensian.

8
00:00:35,025 --> 00:00:39,541
I'm having a difficult time avoiding
people telling me about the ending.

9
00:00:39,905 --> 00:00:42,419
Hi, Roz, did you watch last night?

10
00:00:42,699 --> 00:00:45,293
- Wasn't it...
- Goodbye, Betty.

11
00:00:49,081 --> 00:00:51,072
Hey, Dr Crane. How was your day?

12
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:53,972
Interminable. Is the tape in the VCR?

13
00:00:54,253 --> 00:00:55,447
Yes, it's all cued up.

14
00:00:56,255 --> 00:01:00,043
You've got to call me when
you get to the part with Heather's baby.

15
00:01:01,718 --> 00:01:03,674
- Heather had a baby?
- Sorry.

16
00:01:03,929 --> 00:01:05,999
Who's the father? No, don't tell me.

17
00:01:06,265 --> 00:01:08,460
I'll put your popcorn in the microwave.

18
00:01:17,985 --> 00:01:20,897
- Hey, Fras.
- Hi, Dad.

19
00:01:22,447 --> 00:01:27,157
I got some bad news. There isn't a good
way to tell you something like this.

20
00:01:31,248 --> 00:01:33,239
Your god-uncle died.

21
00:01:34,042 --> 00:01:36,602
My god-uncle?

22
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:40,336
There's no such thing.

23
00:01:40,591 --> 00:01:45,301
It's your godfather's brother.
You remember your god-uncle Charlie.

24
00:01:45,679 --> 00:01:50,230
No. I barely even remember my godfather.
He died 20 years ago.

25
00:01:50,601 --> 00:01:53,911
Now his brother's dead, too.
The wake's in 20 minutes.

26
00:01:54,229 --> 00:01:58,017
Much as I'd like to pay my respects,
catch up with my god-cousins,

27
00:01:58,358 --> 00:02:00,349
and meet the god-neighbours,

28
00:02:00,611 --> 00:02:03,444
I have some urgent business
that can't wait.

29
00:02:03,739 --> 00:02:07,891
Here's your popcorn and the remote.
There, enjoy your show.

30
00:02:12,956 --> 00:02:15,516
All right.
I don't even know why I'm going.

31
00:02:15,792 --> 00:02:18,750
The man used to hide
his glass eye in my marble bag.

32
00:02:19,046 --> 00:02:21,037
I knew you remembered him.

33
00:02:21,298 --> 00:02:23,892
Just give me a couple of minutes
to get changed.

34
00:02:26,929 --> 00:02:28,920
- Hello, Frasier.
- Hello, Niles.

35
00:02:29,181 --> 00:02:32,969
You'd be smart to leave. Dad's dragging
me to a wake for god-uncle Charlie.

36
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:35,949
The one who'd plop his eyeball
into his potatoes

37
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:38,698
- and say, "I'm watching what I eat"?
- Yes.

38
00:02:40,901 --> 00:02:43,495
- So, is Daphne here?
- Yes, she is. Why?

39
00:02:43,779 --> 00:02:47,089
I'm asking her out on a date.
And don't give me that look.

40
00:02:47,407 --> 00:02:49,841
Why shouldn't l?
She's single. I'm single.

41
00:02:50,118 --> 00:02:51,471
Are you ready?

42
00:02:51,703 --> 00:02:54,615
I'm not talking about eloping.
It's just dinner.

43
00:02:54,915 --> 00:02:58,464
I suppose you've thought this through.
Maybe it is time.

44
00:02:58,794 --> 00:03:03,629
- Time for what?
- To put this popcorn away for later.

45
00:03:04,007 --> 00:03:08,319
- Aren't you watching your programme?
- He has to take Dad to a wake.

46
00:03:08,679 --> 00:03:10,670
Listen, Daphne, do you have a minute?

47
00:03:10,931 --> 00:03:15,846
Something I wanted to ask you.
Nothing earth-shattering. It's just...

48
00:03:16,228 --> 00:03:17,980
Yes?

49
00:03:19,856 --> 00:03:22,086
What's that perfume you're wearing?

50
00:03:22,359 --> 00:03:24,873
Leave it to you to notice.
It's Obsession.

51
00:03:25,153 --> 00:03:27,144
No, it isn't. I was just curious.

52
00:03:29,324 --> 00:03:32,202
No, I'm quite sure
it's Calvin Klein's Obsession.

53
00:03:32,494 --> 00:03:33,813
It's very pleasing.

54
00:03:34,037 --> 00:03:36,551
I spray it on my brush
and comb it through.

55
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:39,869
Silly, really.
As if anyone's going to smell my hair.

56
00:03:43,881 --> 00:03:46,349
- What did she say?
- I couldn't do it.

57
00:03:46,633 --> 00:03:51,024
I was about to ask, then all I could
think ofwas what if she said no.

58
00:03:51,388 --> 00:03:56,064
It's no surprise. After all
you've been through with Maris,

59
00:03:56,435 --> 00:03:58,744
you are just scared
of another rejection.

60
00:03:59,021 --> 00:04:01,455
I was more than scared, I was terrified.

61
00:04:01,732 --> 00:04:04,292
I can't go on
worshipping Daphne from afar.

62
00:04:04,568 --> 00:04:07,002
It's frustrating
to be in love with someone

63
00:04:07,279 --> 00:04:09,713
and not be able to tell her
how you feel.

64
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:16,391
I'm sorry. I just came back for
the fabric softener. I didn't mean...

65
00:04:16,747 --> 00:04:19,420
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

66
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:22,700
- How long was she there?
- I don't know. If I'd known,

67
00:04:23,003 --> 00:04:26,916
I would've said,
"Shut up. Daphne's standing there".

68
00:04:27,257 --> 00:04:29,452
She heard everything.

69
00:04:29,718 --> 00:04:33,552
Calm down. It may even be for the best.
You wanted to take the next step.

70
00:04:33,889 --> 00:04:37,359
The next step. I was just hurled
down the entire flight of stairs.

71
00:04:37,684 --> 00:04:39,675
I can't believe this.

72
00:04:39,937 --> 00:04:43,930
Did Daphne really hear me say
that I'm in love...

73
00:04:45,108 --> 00:04:48,100
I'm sorry.
I really do need that fabric softener.

74
00:04:55,035 --> 00:04:59,028
You've got to talk to her.
It'll only become awkward.

75
00:04:59,373 --> 00:05:02,331
You can't leave things like this.
Resolve it now.

76
00:05:02,626 --> 00:05:04,617
Go.

77
00:05:05,379 --> 00:05:08,576
- Daphne...
- Dr Crane, I didn't...

78
00:05:08,882 --> 00:05:12,272
- I hope you don't think...
- No, l... Go ahead.

79
00:05:12,594 --> 00:05:16,143
I'm terribly sorry.
I know I wasn't supposed to hear that.

80
00:05:16,473 --> 00:05:20,705
No, I'm glad you heard. It's something
I've been wanting to tell you.

81
00:05:21,061 --> 00:05:25,498
What took you so long?
I think it's wonderful.

82
00:05:25,857 --> 00:05:29,293
- You do?
- Yes, of course I do.

83
00:05:29,611 --> 00:05:32,125
You dear, sweet man, give me a hug.

84
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:44,497
So, who is she?

85
00:05:48,005 --> 00:05:51,315
- Who?
- This woman you're so in love with.

86
00:05:51,633 --> 00:05:54,591
You didn't hear that part, did you?

87
00:05:54,887 --> 00:05:58,641
No. So, come on, what's her name?
You can't back out now.

88
00:05:58,974 --> 00:06:01,169
No, you're right. I can't.

89
00:06:01,435 --> 00:06:03,107
OK, her name...

90
00:06:03,353 --> 00:06:07,505
...just happens to be...
Da-Phyllis.

91
00:06:10,152 --> 00:06:14,270
I've never heard that name. Da-Phyllis.

92
00:06:16,158 --> 00:06:19,753
It's a family name.
Her friends call her Phyllis.

93
00:06:22,915 --> 00:06:26,874
Excuse me. I'll get some water.

94
00:06:27,211 --> 00:06:28,769
Where's Niles?

95
00:06:29,004 --> 00:06:32,314
He's in the kitchen.
I'm sorry to barge in on you like that.

96
00:06:32,633 --> 00:06:35,352
Did you and Niles have a little chat?

97
00:06:35,636 --> 00:06:39,345
Yes. He was a bit shy at first
but then he came clean.

98
00:06:39,681 --> 00:06:42,149
- I couldn't be happier.
- That is wonderful.

99
00:06:42,434 --> 00:06:44,584
Let me be the first
to raise a glass to...

100
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:50,181
...to god-uncle Charlie.

101
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,672
As long as you're doing the laundry,
the kitchen towels could use a washing.

102
00:06:56,031 --> 00:06:59,228
And my oven mitts
are getting a bit crunchy.

103
00:06:59,535 --> 00:07:01,253
What the hell is going on?

104
00:07:01,495 --> 00:07:05,090
All she heard was that I was in love
with someone and when she asked who,

105
00:07:05,415 --> 00:07:07,406
I blurted out Phyllis.

106
00:07:07,668 --> 00:07:09,340
Phyllis?

107
00:07:09,586 --> 00:07:11,577
It's a neighbour I saw this morning.

108
00:07:11,838 --> 00:07:14,432
She had a sesame seed
stuck between her teeth.

109
00:07:14,716 --> 00:07:17,150
It was the size of a blanched almond.

110
00:07:18,262 --> 00:07:21,220
Maybe it was a blanched almond.
If she had Mueslix...

111
00:07:21,515 --> 00:07:23,585
Niles, stop.

112
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:26,728
You have got to clear this up.

113
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:30,933
Well, I'm off to bring the car around
for Dad.

114
00:07:34,027 --> 00:07:37,417
All right now,
tell me more about this Phyllis.

115
00:07:37,739 --> 00:07:39,331
I'd rather not.

116
00:07:39,575 --> 00:07:43,284
You said you wanted to talk about it.
Have you asked her out yet?

117
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:44,609
No.

118
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:47,105
Why not?
You said you were in love with her.

119
00:07:47,374 --> 00:07:49,365
- In love with who?
- Phyllis.

120
00:07:49,626 --> 00:07:51,821
- Who's Phyllis?
- A woman I met.

121
00:07:52,087 --> 00:07:54,806
I've just been giving him
some dating advice.

122
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:59,208
All you need to know
is that women go crazy for flattery.

123
00:07:59,553 --> 00:08:02,863
Doesn't matter if it's a big fat lie.
They'll still buy it.

124
00:08:03,181 --> 00:08:08,301
Whatever advice Daphne's giving you,
must be great because she's smart.

125
00:08:08,687 --> 00:08:10,678
Thank you, Mr Crane.

126
00:08:13,358 --> 00:08:16,714
So, tell me about this dream woman
ofyours.

127
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:21,819
- I don't know.
- I can see you're crazy about her.

128
00:08:24,828 --> 00:08:26,546
Well, all right.

129
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,589
She's very beautiful. And very sweet.

130
00:08:32,377 --> 00:08:35,335
And she has a smile
that makes my knees weaken.

131
00:08:38,842 --> 00:08:42,881
Dr Crane, if this woman is as wonderful
as you say she is,

132
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:47,340
then you shouldn't waste another moment.
She won't be on the market forever.

133
00:08:47,684 --> 00:08:50,403
You're right.
I've been a fool to hesitate.

134
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:52,917
- That's the spirit.
- I'm going to do it.

135
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:57,900
Don't leave time for second thoughts.
Ask her out this instant.

136
00:08:58,278 --> 00:09:01,395
- That won't be necessary.
- It's quite nasty out.

137
00:09:02,157 --> 00:09:06,708
No, I don't have to leave this room
to ask Phyllis on a date.

138
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:10,754
- You don't?
- No. Because, you see, Daphne...

139
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:15,235
I know her work number by heart.

140
00:09:16,338 --> 00:09:17,327
Well, then.

141
00:09:21,718 --> 00:09:24,516
- Look at me. My heart's racing.
- Mine, too.

142
00:09:28,225 --> 00:09:30,614
Phyllis, hello. Niles Crane.

143
00:09:30,894 --> 00:09:33,362
How are you?

144
00:09:33,647 --> 00:09:37,196
I was wondering if you would want
to have dinner with me sometime.

145
00:09:37,526 --> 00:09:41,485
You would?
How about tonight at my place?

146
00:09:42,823 --> 00:09:44,814
Eight o'clock sounds great.

147
00:09:49,329 --> 00:09:52,048
What would you do if you were me?

148
00:09:52,332 --> 00:09:56,530
Would you tell her everything and just
let the chips fall where they may or...

149
00:09:57,296 --> 00:10:00,094
Yeah. Well, I do see your point.

150
00:10:01,592 --> 00:10:05,949
I have to run. I'll take the three-year
subscription and travel clock.

151
00:10:15,898 --> 00:10:18,492
- Daphne.
- Hello. I was out doing some shopping

152
00:10:18,775 --> 00:10:22,609
and I thought you might need some
dessert for your dinner with Phyllis.

153
00:10:22,946 --> 00:10:26,416
Well, I was just doing some
last-minute tidying up forthat.

154
00:10:26,742 --> 00:10:29,700
And I suppose you've got
about eight things cooking.

155
00:10:29,995 --> 00:10:33,226
So I'll get out ofyourway.
Soon as I pop this in the fridge.

156
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:36,008
Don't trouble yourself.
I'll do it.

157
00:10:39,129 --> 00:10:42,963
Dr Crane, there's barely enough pasta
here for one person.

158
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:47,293
Is this your idea of a romantic dinner?

159
00:10:47,638 --> 00:10:49,993
Thank heavens I stopped by.

160
00:10:50,891 --> 00:10:55,282
I can whip up a salad. I'll stick
this roast in the microwave to defrost.

161
00:10:55,646 --> 00:10:59,844
- Where's your cooking sherry?
- I am under-prepared for this.

162
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:02,183
I'll call Phyllis and put her off.

163
00:11:02,444 --> 00:11:06,722
You're not backing out ofthis now.
Look, don't worry.

164
00:11:07,074 --> 00:11:10,191
I'll fix this place right up
for a nice, intimate evening.

165
00:11:10,494 --> 00:11:15,648
Candles, some soft music. Those things
always put me in a romantic mood.

166
00:11:17,376 --> 00:11:19,571
I suppose it would be rude to cancel.

167
00:11:19,836 --> 00:11:21,906
Now hurry up and get ready.

168
00:11:22,172 --> 00:11:26,006
And wear that blue blazer ofyours.
No woman can resist you in that.

169
00:11:26,426 --> 00:11:28,781
Look at the time. Honestly, Dr Crane,

170
00:11:29,054 --> 00:11:33,047
sometimes I wonder what kind of
a fantasy world you live in. Now go on.

171
00:12:00,752 --> 00:12:03,505
- Don't you look handsome.
- Thank you.

172
00:12:03,797 --> 00:12:06,027
Daphne, this place looks wonderful.

173
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,291
Excellent music. I love this aria.

174
00:12:08,552 --> 00:12:12,909
Yes, she has a gorgeous voice.
Pity she never got the recognition

175
00:12:13,265 --> 00:12:15,779
of a Joan Sutherland
or a Renata Tebaldi.

176
00:12:16,059 --> 00:12:18,619
I had no idea
you knew so much about sopranos.

177
00:12:18,896 --> 00:12:24,129
You don't live with your brother and
not learn a thing or two about divas.

178
00:12:24,526 --> 00:12:26,801
The roast is coming along nicely.

179
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:30,062
- How are you at chopping vegetables?
- Are you kidding?

180
00:12:30,365 --> 00:12:34,563
You don't get forearms like these
from just conducting your stereo.

181
00:12:34,912 --> 00:12:38,029
I'm very excited for you.
I just love first dates.

182
00:12:38,332 --> 00:12:41,688
I don't see why.
They're always so awkward.

183
00:12:42,002 --> 00:12:45,472
Yeah, but once in a while,
when the chemistry's just right,

184
00:12:45,797 --> 00:12:50,393
they can be magical. The "me toos"
as you realise all you have in common,

185
00:12:50,761 --> 00:12:53,798
the electricity
of that first accidental touch,

186
00:12:54,097 --> 00:12:57,373
soon you're saying the silliest things.

187
00:12:57,684 --> 00:12:58,958
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry.

188
00:12:59,186 --> 00:13:02,098
You touched me,
now we have to get married.

189
00:13:04,691 --> 00:13:06,682
- Pardon me.
- Sorry.

190
00:13:06,944 --> 00:13:10,698
Now I was thinking for the salad
some cucumbers and carrots.

191
00:13:11,031 --> 00:13:13,670
- How about some celery?
- No celery. I hate it.

192
00:13:13,951 --> 00:13:16,545
Me, too. Why do you have it then?

193
00:13:16,828 --> 00:13:21,026
Habit. Maris used to like to have it
around in case she felt like bingeing.

194
00:13:24,461 --> 00:13:28,773
When I was little, I actually thought
celery was the meanest vegetable.

195
00:13:29,132 --> 00:13:33,250
Radishes were the smartest,
beets were the policemen.

196
00:13:35,222 --> 00:13:37,690
What sort of personality
do carrots have?

197
00:13:37,975 --> 00:13:41,285
I try not to think about that
when I'm chopping them.

198
00:13:49,027 --> 00:13:51,302
You hear that? We're chopping in rhythm.

199
00:13:51,572 --> 00:13:53,563
We are, aren'twe?

200
00:14:21,018 --> 00:14:23,009
Damn, who could that be?

201
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:24,259
It's Phyllis.

202
00:14:28,317 --> 00:14:30,592
Well, go on. Go let her in.

203
00:14:33,197 --> 00:14:39,067
Go away, who's ever at the door,
go away, don't come back no more.

204
00:14:39,494 --> 00:14:41,485
I thought you were at a wake.

205
00:14:41,747 --> 00:14:45,820
We left. Even the mourners
were babbling about the mini-series.

206
00:14:46,168 --> 00:14:48,921
I'm sure you're in a rush
to watch the rest of it.

207
00:14:49,213 --> 00:14:51,522
No, everybody's
going to the Kiwanis Club

208
00:14:51,798 --> 00:14:54,153
for a post-wake kegger.
Could you take Dad?

209
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:57,020
Me? Well, they're your god-family.

210
00:14:57,304 --> 00:15:01,013
- I thought you were Phyllis.
- Phyllis?

211
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:07,141
She's due any moment. I'll be leaving
as soon as the roast is done.

212
00:15:09,691 --> 00:15:12,444
Daphne... is cooking dinner...

213
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:16,164
for your date with a fictitious woman.

214
00:15:17,658 --> 00:15:20,968
Why not just set a place
for the March Hare and the Mad Hatter?

215
00:15:21,286 --> 00:15:24,323
I didn't plan forthis,
butwe are having a perfect evening.

216
00:15:24,623 --> 00:15:28,616
I need a few more minutes alone
and I'll be able to tell her everything.

217
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:32,112
Niles, this absurd lie is likely
to blow up in yourface.

218
00:15:32,422 --> 00:15:34,811
As long as I keep track
ofwhat I'm saying,

219
00:15:35,092 --> 00:15:37,447
nothing is going to blow up on anyone.

220
00:15:38,554 --> 00:15:40,590
Phyllis!

221
00:15:40,847 --> 00:15:42,485
Ka-boom.

222
00:15:42,724 --> 00:15:45,557
Some ofyour mail
wound up in my box today.

223
00:15:45,852 --> 00:15:48,366
- Aren't you considerate?
- Hello.

224
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:52,242
- I'm Frasier, Niles' brother.
- I hope I'm not interrupting.

225
00:15:52,568 --> 00:15:57,403
- As a matter of fact...
- Hello. You must be Phyllis.

226
00:15:57,781 --> 00:15:59,851
Yes. Do I know you?

227
00:16:00,117 --> 00:16:03,154
I'm Daphne. I'm just a friend.

228
00:16:04,913 --> 00:16:08,303
Make yourself comfortable.
We were starting to worry.

229
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:11,662
- Excuse me?
- Can I get you a glass ofwine?

230
00:16:11,962 --> 00:16:15,841
- All right. I came by to drop off...
- I'll be back in a snap.

231
00:16:16,174 --> 00:16:19,052
That woman seemed to think
that you were expecting me.

232
00:16:19,344 --> 00:16:21,653
I've been getting to know my neighbours

233
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:24,319
and I guess
you didn't get the invitation.

234
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,830
No. It's dumb luck I stopped by tonight.

235
00:16:27,102 --> 00:16:29,775
Here we are. Now the appetisers
are almost ready

236
00:16:30,063 --> 00:16:34,136
and it won't be much longer until
the roast is done. I hope you're hungry.

237
00:16:34,484 --> 00:16:38,796
- The invitation was for dinner?
- Yes, but we'll do it another time.

238
00:16:39,156 --> 00:16:40,635
I'd love to stay.

239
00:16:43,493 --> 00:16:46,291
- Hey, Niles. Frasier, you coming?
- In a minute, Dad.

240
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:50,459
- Daph, what are you doing here?
- Helping Dr Crane with his dinner.

241
00:16:50,792 --> 00:16:55,263
- Hi. How are you doing? Marty Crane.
- Hi, I'm Phyllis Conrad.

242
00:16:55,631 --> 00:16:59,544
- You're Phyllis, huh?
- Don't worry. We'll be going soon.

243
00:16:59,885 --> 00:17:03,116
Dr Crane's
eager to have you all to himself.

244
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:06,706
- Really?
- He's been going on about you all week.

245
00:17:07,017 --> 00:17:09,406
How pretty you are. How nice you dress.

246
00:17:09,686 --> 00:17:11,881
Dad, you don't want to be late.

247
00:17:12,147 --> 00:17:16,459
- I've embarrassed him. He's blushing.
- He's not the only one.

248
00:17:16,818 --> 00:17:19,093
Excuse me, Phyllis. Frasier, could l...

249
00:17:22,407 --> 00:17:25,922
- Help me get rid of her.
- I've got my hands full with Dad.

250
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:28,679
You never had any idea
he had his eye on you?

251
00:17:28,956 --> 00:17:31,948
I caught him staring at me
in the elevatorthis morning.

252
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:34,685
Now I knowwhy.

253
00:17:34,962 --> 00:17:37,476
Dr Crane, would you give me a hand?

254
00:17:37,756 --> 00:17:38,825
Frasier?

255
00:17:39,049 --> 00:17:42,166
Dad, I guess it's time we were going.

256
00:17:42,469 --> 00:17:45,142
Maybe you could
go press for the elevator.

257
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:47,990
All right.
Very nice meeting you, Phyllis.

258
00:17:51,937 --> 00:17:56,965
Well, your brother certainly kept
his feelings to himself until tonight.

259
00:17:57,359 --> 00:18:00,556
Yes, well,
he's always been the quiet type.

260
00:18:02,573 --> 00:18:06,964
Especially since all
the trouble with Heather.

261
00:18:07,327 --> 00:18:08,646
Heather?

262
00:18:08,871 --> 00:18:13,661
The pie should be heated and there's
cream to put on the strawberries.

263
00:18:14,042 --> 00:18:17,955
Or anything else,
should the night take that turn.

264
00:18:19,047 --> 00:18:22,357
- His wife was poisoned?
- He stood trial. They never proved it.

265
00:18:22,676 --> 00:18:24,587
Crab puffs?

266
00:18:27,514 --> 00:18:33,464
No, thank you. I just remembered,
there is someplace that I have to be.

267
00:18:33,896 --> 00:18:36,285
Thank you very much for the wine.

268
00:18:36,565 --> 00:18:38,556
Oh, my God, I drank the wine.

269
00:18:42,696 --> 00:18:45,574
- What did you tell her?
- I'll explain later, Niles.

270
00:18:45,866 --> 00:18:49,495
But don't plan on running for
the co-op board here anytime soon.

271
00:18:51,997 --> 00:18:54,033
- Where did Phyllis go?
- She left.

272
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:56,885
She said she wasn't feeling well.

273
00:18:57,169 --> 00:19:01,606
Hope you don't mind my saying so. You
almost seem relieved that she's gone.

274
00:19:01,965 --> 00:19:07,403
Relieved? Well, Daphne,
to tell you the truth, I am relieved.

275
00:19:07,804 --> 00:19:11,433
I knew it. This is all my fault.

276
00:19:11,767 --> 00:19:15,601
It's as clear as day now.
You're just not ready for a relationship

277
00:19:15,938 --> 00:19:18,611
- and there I was pushing you into it.
- Daphne...

278
00:19:18,899 --> 00:19:21,459
I could see how uncomfortable
you were.

279
00:19:21,735 --> 00:19:25,330
She must have picked up on that, too,
and that's why she left.

280
00:19:25,656 --> 00:19:28,124
- What was I thinking?
- This is not your fault.

281
00:19:28,408 --> 00:19:33,038
Yes, but I should've seen. You're
on the rebound. You're still vulnerable.

282
00:19:33,413 --> 00:19:37,691
That's probably why you had so much
trouble asking for a simple date.

283
00:19:39,711 --> 00:19:42,350
Yes, I suppose you're right.

284
00:19:42,631 --> 00:19:47,989
I'm so sorry, Dr Crane. I guess
you just need to take some more time.

285
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:53,097
Ifyou rush things, you may ruin
something that has a real chance.

286
00:19:53,475 --> 00:19:58,265
No smart woman would get involved
with a man in the middle of a divorce.

287
00:19:58,647 --> 00:20:00,683
I know I never would.

288
00:20:00,941 --> 00:20:06,174
Well, thank you, Daphne.
This has all been very helpful.

289
00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:09,245
And thank you
for everything you did tonight,

290
00:20:09,533 --> 00:20:12,252
even if it didn'twork out
exactly as I'd hoped.

291
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:14,728
What are friends for?

292
00:20:19,668 --> 00:20:22,660
I suppose
we should start clearing all this up.

293
00:20:22,963 --> 00:20:23,952
Actually,

294
00:20:25,173 --> 00:20:26,162
Daphne,

295
00:20:27,843 --> 00:20:30,801
would you like to stay
and have dinner with me?

296
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:33,564
- You mean that?
- Yes.

297
00:20:34,766 --> 00:20:37,405
Well, yes, that would be lovely.

298
00:20:38,979 --> 00:20:42,016
Wonderful. May I pour you some wine?

299
00:20:47,988 --> 00:20:51,298
You know, although it seems hopeless
right now,

300
00:20:51,617 --> 00:20:53,687
I have a feeling that before very long,

301
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:57,991
you'll be sitting down to a romantic
dinner with the woman ofyour dreams.

302
00:20:58,999 --> 00:21:00,990
I thinkyou may just be right.

303
00:21:02,502 --> 00:21:04,094
Shall we?

304
00:21:09,051 --> 00:21:10,040
Thankyou.

305
00:21:21,355 --> 00:21:23,107
Here's to us.

306
00:21:27,778 --> 00:21:29,734
That's very nice.

307
00:21:29,988 --> 00:21:32,786
This is the most spectacular wine
I've ever tasted.

308
00:21:33,075 --> 00:21:34,793
I'm glad you like it.
