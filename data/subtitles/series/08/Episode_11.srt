Hey, how's Daphne?

3
00:00:11,887 --> 00:00:14,526
Actually, I just got back
from visiting her at the spa.

4
00:00:14,687 --> 00:00:15,676
ROZ: Yeah.
- It wasn't easy,

5
00:00:15,847 --> 00:00:19,078
but she has already lost
9 pounds and 12 ounces.

weekend, if you need a ride.

and I'm bringing the goodies.

Yes, so I see.

Well, aren't you a little overdressed
for a picnic?

Well, there is this cute
single dad named Greg.

- Oh.
- He's going through a divorce.

16

His wife cheated on him.
He's so nice too.

- No.

in that science lab.

She was pretty upset about it,

33
00:01:30,367 --> 00:01:33,598
but I was beaming all the way
to the nurse's office.

34

No more nurse's office.

- I don't see how we can prevent it.

alumni arms left to be twisted.

38

Well, maybe we're twisting
the wrong arms.

to any cause that comes along.

Let's get some of that cash
flowing Bryce's way.

How soon we can get
our well-to-do friends together?

No time to waste, Niles.
How's Wednesday evening?

44
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:03,357
No, can't. Theatre tickets.
How about Thursday?

45
00:02:03,527 --> 00:02:04,960
An appointment at the spa.

- Well, not willingly.

It's with the good masseur,

He's blind.

When he said he couldn't see clients,
I thought he was just booked all week.

So see you tomorrow, okay?

154
00:06:56,327 --> 00:06:57,396
Great.

155
00:07:01,967 --> 00:07:04,117
- Bye, guys.
- Bye-bye.

156
00:07:07,567 --> 00:07:10,639
I'm beat.
Well, see you guys tomorrow.

157
00:07:10,807 --> 00:07:12,445
BOTH:
Dad?

158
00:07:13,287 --> 00:07:16,006
Oh, all right. Here's what happened.

159
00:07:16,167 --> 00:07:18,556
Penelope and I got along great,
but after I dropped her off,

160
00:07:18,727 --> 00:07:20,922
I was still hungry.
So I went to this little coffee shop

161
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:22,645
near McGinty's
to get some chilli fries.

162
00:07:22,807 --> 00:07:25,605
Now, I know what you're wondering.
Doesn't McGinty's have chilli fries?

163
00:07:25,767 --> 00:07:27,359
Yes, and they're very tasty.

164
00:07:27,527 --> 00:07:30,087
Who the hell is Estelle?

165
00:07:30,247 --> 00:07:32,238
She works at the coffee shop.
We got chatting,

166
00:07:32,407 --> 00:07:34,841
the next thing you know,
we're having a nightcap at McGinty's.

167
00:07:35,007 --> 00:07:37,362
Hey, when it rains, it pours.

168
00:07:37,527 --> 00:07:39,199
Yes, Dad, but what about Penelope?

169
00:07:39,367 --> 00:07:42,245
- Oh, I'm seeing her Tuesday.
- You just made a date with Estelle.

170
00:07:42,407 --> 00:07:44,318
Not for Tuesday.

171
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:46,719
You're gonna date both of them?

172
00:07:46,887 --> 00:07:49,003
- Are you sure that's wise?
- Well, it's just dating.

173
00:07:49,167 --> 00:07:51,761
I met them both at the same time.
I like them both.

174
00:07:51,927 --> 00:07:54,441
- Where's the harm in it?
- Don't you think it's a little risky?

175
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:56,279
What if one of them
should find out about...

176
00:07:56,447 --> 00:07:57,846
- Penelope, for example.
- Yes, yes.

177
00:07:58,007 --> 00:07:59,759
You wouldn't want
to alienate her permanently.

178
00:07:59,927 --> 00:08:02,566
Oh, don't worry.
I've watched you juggle.

179
00:08:02,727 --> 00:08:05,241
I've got a pretty good handle
on what not to do.

180
00:08:11,127 --> 00:08:12,799
- Oh, hi, Niles.
- Hey, Roz.

181
00:08:13,447 --> 00:08:15,961
Off to another picnic, I see.

182
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,799
Yeah, Greg and I
are really hitting it off.

183
00:08:17,967 --> 00:08:19,195
He loves my cooking.

184
00:08:19,367 --> 00:08:21,039
I'm sorry, miss,
we're out of lemon bars.

185
00:08:21,207 --> 00:08:22,640
Well, make some more.

186
00:08:22,807 --> 00:08:25,765
And give me a dirty pan.
I need to put it in my sink.

187
00:08:25,927 --> 00:08:28,236
I'm sorry. Our baker
doesn't come in until tomorrow.

188
00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:31,638
- I can give you the recipe.
- What am I supposed to do with that?

189
00:08:32,807 --> 00:08:36,482
- Bake?
- Is that supposed to be funny?

190
00:08:40,007 --> 00:08:41,918
Good Lord, Niles.
You won't believe this.

191
00:08:42,087 --> 00:08:44,521
"Bryce trustees
are already reviewing a proposal

192
00:08:44,687 --> 00:08:46,564
for the purchase of their land."

193
00:08:46,727 --> 00:08:49,560
Dad just walked in. Let's drop
another hint about meeting Penelope.

194
00:08:49,727 --> 00:08:51,843
Time for hints has passed.
We've got to be direct.

195
00:08:52,007 --> 00:08:54,282
Dad is not gonna let us
ask his girlfriend for money.

196
00:08:54,447 --> 00:08:57,519
I didn't say honest. I said direct.
Try to keep up, for God's sakes.

Yeah, a little "pick me up"
in between dates.

Boy, this juggling thing
isn't as easy as I make it look.

But don't you worry.

- Well, sure, I had to.

both my home number, do you?

Come on, Fras, that's amateur hour.

210

See I programmed the phone
for different rings

211
00:09:31,727 --> 00:09:34,446
depending on who's calling, so
that way I don't get caught off guard.

Oh, hi, Estenelope.

Penelope? That's right.
Here son's name's William.

00:09:47,727 --> 00:09:51,003
Yeah. Oh, sure,
Tuesday sounds great.

Pick me up at 7? Okay.

See you then, Penelope.

- Yes, yes.

- Yeah, oh, hold on a sec. What?
- Didn't you just make a date

226
00:10:17,567 --> 00:10:18,602
for Tuesday with Penelope?

227
00:10:18,767 --> 00:10:20,678
- That was Thursday?
- No, we both heard Tuesday.

Oh, thanks.
Boy, that could've been ugly.

Yeah, Estelle, no, sorry.
Thursday's out. It has to be Tuesday.

- No, no, no.
- No, wait, wait.

Thursday. Thursday's what I meant.

Dad, uh...

Dad, listen, we were thinking it might
be time that we meet Penelope.

236
00:10:46,367 --> 00:10:47,800
She sounds enchanting.

237
00:10:47,967 --> 00:10:50,435
- Yeah, enchanting. How's tomorrow?
- Oh, guys, I don't know.

That's taking it up another notch.

I don't wanna get that serious yet.

240
00:10:55,407 --> 00:10:59,002
Maybe in a few months, but right now
I just wanna keep it simple.

241
00:10:59,167 --> 00:11:01,476
Simple? As in Estenelope?

Dear God, what do we do now?

Oh, I don't know.
I guess we could have him neutered.

248
00:11:25,007 --> 00:11:28,363
I suppose we could try to get
to Penelope through her foundation.

249
00:11:28,527 --> 00:11:31,564
I already tried that, and there's a

You cannot just walk out on her party.

Excuse us. I just wanted to alert you

is that my alma mater,
Bryce Academy, is in dire straits.

The coffers are bare,
and our only hope is to find a saviour.

Forgive me for being presumptuous,
but I was hoping it might be you.

Actually, I'm familiar with Bryce.

Penelope is going to write

So until then, I need you to pretend
