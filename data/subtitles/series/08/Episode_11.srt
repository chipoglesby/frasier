Anyway, let's start with the basics.

143
00:07:19,167 --> 00:07:23,445
A car burns gasoline to create small,
carefully timed explosions

144
00:07:23,607 --> 00:07:27,646
whose energy is converted
by the engine into forward motion.

145
00:07:27,807 --> 00:07:29,399
I'll show you how that happens.

So the engine is just like the timpani.

00:07:36,767 --> 00:07:38,644
[WHISPERING]
The conductor drives the orchestra,

149
00:07:38,807 --> 00:07:40,081
not the timpani.

150
00:07:40,247 --> 00:07:41,805
Yes, the conductor
guides the orchestra.

151
00:07:41,967 --> 00:07:43,480
He's more like the steering wheel.

152
00:07:43,647 --> 00:07:46,115
The actual driving forward,
the driving forward,

153
00:07:46,287 --> 00:07:49,677
is actually executed
by the percussion section.

a class in orchestras

155
00:07:52,607 --> 00:07:54,404
rather than automobiles.

156
00:07:55,207 --> 00:07:58,802
- Which links the crankshaft
to the camshaft,

157
00:07:58,967 --> 00:08:00,923
so that the valves
are in sync with the pistons.

158
00:08:01,687 --> 00:08:02,676
SHIRLEY:
Oh.

159
00:08:02,847 --> 00:08:05,077
RANDY: Now, as you can imagine,
the tolerances

160
00:08:05,247 --> 00:08:07,761
of every component in the cylinder...

161
00:08:07,927 --> 00:08:10,361
- What's a camshaft?
- I don't know. You were talking.

162
00:08:12,047 --> 00:08:13,799
RANDY:
The timing's off, even just a little...

163
00:08:13,967 --> 00:08:15,195
Oh, right, here it is.

164
00:08:15,367 --> 00:08:18,359
"The camshaft is the system
that opens and closes the valves."

165
00:08:18,527 --> 00:08:21,087
- So it's this thing it shows here.
- Right, right, good, got it.

166
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:23,477
That was close.
We almost got behind.

167
00:08:23,647 --> 00:08:26,002
- Well, let's not let that happen again.
- Agreed.

168
00:08:26,167 --> 00:08:30,524
And if you only take one thing away
from this course, that should be it.

169
00:08:33,207 --> 00:08:35,846
Okay, moving on.

170
00:08:40,007 --> 00:08:42,077
RANDY: So if you're finished
changing the spark plugs,

171
00:08:42,247 --> 00:08:44,397
you're free to leave,
and I'll see you next week.

172
00:08:46,487 --> 00:08:49,285
Niles, it's down to us and Shirley.

173
00:08:49,447 --> 00:08:51,836
SHIRLEY:
I did it. I did it. Whoo!

174
00:08:52,007 --> 00:08:53,486
Good job, Shirley.

175
00:08:55,847 --> 00:08:57,758
All right, perseverance, Frasier.
We'll get this.

176
00:08:57,927 --> 00:09:00,964
Right, right. Oh, would you take off
those stupid goggles?

177
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:04,246
- Well, I'm sorry, it's for safety.
- Nobody else wore them.

178
00:09:04,407 --> 00:09:05,999
No one else wore them
in gym class either.

179
00:09:06,167 --> 00:09:09,125
But Tommy Fritz scratched his cornea,
and then they were mandatory.

180
00:09:09,287 --> 00:09:12,438
Give me that wrench.
Give me that wrench.

181
00:09:15,207 --> 00:09:17,277
I'm telling you, I'm telling you,
it's on too tight.

182
00:09:17,447 --> 00:09:19,483
Here, I'll just try to loosen it up.

183
00:09:19,647 --> 00:09:21,524
Whoa! Whoa!

184
00:09:21,687 --> 00:09:24,838
Remember, uh, spark plugs come out
with a simple twist and pull.

185
00:09:25,007 --> 00:09:27,885
Twist and pull. Give it a try.

186
00:09:31,327 --> 00:09:35,240
- Oh!
- Okay, that's called stripping it.

187
00:09:36,047 --> 00:09:37,924
Wow. Good job, Frasier.
Here, let me strip one.

188
00:09:38,087 --> 00:09:39,725
No, no.

189
00:09:40,527 --> 00:09:44,156
Stripping it means breaking it.
Uh, watch me.

190
00:09:49,687 --> 00:09:55,478
So you twist and then pull.

191
00:09:55,647 --> 00:09:57,638
You see, I was twisting
and pulling simultaneously,

192
00:09:57,807 --> 00:10:00,640
as per your instructions,
twist and pull.

193
00:10:00,807 --> 00:10:05,119
In the future, the phrase
"twist then pull" might help.

194
00:10:06,847 --> 00:10:09,805
Look, fellas, maybe that's enough
for one night.

195
00:10:09,967 --> 00:10:11,958
But why don't you come in
a little early next week,

196
00:10:12,127 --> 00:10:14,118
and I'll try to get you caught up
to everyone else?

197
00:10:14,287 --> 00:10:17,677
I got a feeling you guys
are gonna be my special project.

198
00:10:22,487 --> 00:10:24,318
Did you hear that, Frasier?

199
00:10:24,487 --> 00:10:26,682
We have to come in for tutoring.

200
00:10:27,167 --> 00:10:29,761
We've become remedial students.

201
00:10:30,847 --> 00:10:34,123
I know. It's humiliating.

202
00:10:34,287 --> 00:10:38,246
I thought we signed up for this class
to avoid humiliation.

203
00:10:38,407 --> 00:10:42,639
I guess we're just gonna have
to roll up our shirtsleeves

204
00:10:42,807 --> 00:10:45,196
and see it through
for the next eight weeks.

205
00:10:45,367 --> 00:10:47,244
Of course we will.

206
00:10:48,727 --> 00:10:51,764
- Although...
- I'm listening.

207
00:10:53,287 --> 00:10:54,481
What do we actually accomplish

208
00:10:54,647 --> 00:10:57,480
by learning
to change our own spark plugs?

209
00:10:57,647 --> 00:10:59,922
Oh, yes, of course,
we acquire a new skill,

210
00:11:00,087 --> 00:11:04,319
but aren't we taking a job away
from a qualified mechanic?

211
00:11:04,927 --> 00:11:06,838
Someone who may have a family
to support.

212
00:11:07,007 --> 00:11:09,885
Not to mention all the merchants
who depend on his disposable income

213
00:11:10,047 --> 00:11:12,845
- for their livelihood.
- Yes, the human toll begins to mount.

214
00:11:13,007 --> 00:11:15,475
- Society decays.
- Not if I have anything to say about it.

215
00:11:15,647 --> 00:11:17,365
Niles. I'm quitting.

216
00:11:17,847 --> 00:11:20,156

you'll quit too.

Do we have time for gelato?

Hello, Daphne.

221

DAPHNE: Your ears
must have been burning tonight.

222
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:37,685
I've been bragging about you
on the phone to my mom.

223

I know I said you didn't have
to take this auto class,

224
00:11:40,847 --> 00:11:42,280
but I rather like the idea of my man

225
00:11:42,447 --> 00:11:44,756
being able to rescue me
by the roadside.

226
00:11:44,927 --> 00:11:46,485
- You do?
- Yeah.

It just shows me
how much you care.

228
00:11:50,567 --> 00:11:54,276
Well, um, next week,
we're flushing radiators.

229

230
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:05,002
Hey, Mr. Goodwrench.

231
00:12:07,087 --> 00:12:09,237
- Recognise this?
- No.

232
00:12:09,407 --> 00:12:11,602
Well, it's your grandpa's old toolbox.

233
00:12:11,767 --> 00:12:13,962
He gave it to me when I was 18.

234
00:12:14,127 --> 00:12:17,039
I think you're ready for it now.

235
00:12:20,847 --> 00:12:22,997
Well, thanks, Dad, but...

236
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:25,806
I know it sounds kind of corny,
but it meant a lot to me

237
00:12:25,967 --> 00:12:27,525
when my father gave that to me.

238
00:12:27,927 --> 00:12:30,202
Every time I use it, I think of him.

239
00:12:30,367 --> 00:12:31,959
And maybe every time you use it
in class,

240
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:34,357
you'll think of your old man
and how proud he is.

241
00:12:34,527 --> 00:12:36,597
Oh, gosh, Dad,
I don't know what to say.

242
00:12:36,767 --> 00:12:39,884
Well, maybe someday,
you'll pass it on to your son.

243

But first maybe I'll remove
the topless playing cards.

244

Your grandpa loved the nudies.

Yes, Martin, I'll be home in time
to feed the puppy.

We're trying to study.

Wow. That reminds me of college.

and wishing I'd studied instead.

those four months with you,

Frasier, it's useless.
It's pointless, it's boring.

00:13:32,167 --> 00:13:34,237
And, really, who cares?

Wow, it sounds like you guys
should just quit.

If only we could, Roz.

It's just that Dad and Daphne are
proud of us, we can't let them down.

260
00:13:41,807 --> 00:13:43,399
They've already
bought mahogany frames

261

so they can showcase
our certificates of completion.

262
00:13:46,407 --> 00:13:48,796
So complete it. I mean,
that doesn't mean you have to ace it.

Just sit there and nod your head
a few times, and you're home free.

[EDDIE GROWLING]

308
00:16:26,687 --> 00:16:29,679
Uh, the brake pedal feels
a little mushy.

309
00:16:29,847 --> 00:16:32,315
What is the possible cause?

310
00:16:32,487 --> 00:16:35,524
Let's get someone new this time.
How about Frasier?

311
00:16:43,327 --> 00:16:44,726
What?

312
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:51,158
What would cause a mushy feeling
in the brakes?

313
00:16:57,527 --> 00:16:58,721
I don't know.

314
00:16:59,887 --> 00:17:00,956
Niles?

315
00:17:01,567 --> 00:17:03,125
Uh, mush?

316
00:17:05,327 --> 00:17:07,477
It's caused by a leak
in the brake line.

317
00:17:07,647 --> 00:17:09,603
Good, Shirley.
Did everybody hear that?

318
00:17:09,767 --> 00:17:11,962
Her voice was kind of muffled.

319
00:17:12,607 --> 00:17:16,236
What with her lips
being pressed up against Randy's butt.

00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:21,078
Guys, this is the last time
I'm gonna tell you.

322
00:17:21,247 --> 00:17:22,521
Keep it down, okay?

323
00:17:24,207 --> 00:17:27,597
A leak in the brake line is, uh,
certainly a possible cause.

324
00:17:27,767 --> 00:17:30,804
Ah. Another culprit might be
the wheel cylinder.

325
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:33,686
If the caps are brittle and cracked,
you can develop a leak there too.

[FRASIER SNICKERING]

327
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:38,324
Either case, the hydraulics...

328
00:17:40,447 --> 00:17:42,881
Is that a funny note there?

329
00:17:43,047 --> 00:17:47,006
I enjoy funny things.
Why don't I share it with the class?

330
00:17:50,447 --> 00:17:53,280
Does anybody here read French?

331

Let me see you guys out in the hall.

CLASS: Ooh...
WOMAN: Busted.

335
00:18:14,887 --> 00:18:16,525
And bring your books and tools.

336
00:18:18,607 --> 00:18:21,997
Uh-oh. We're in trouble now.

337
00:18:22,487 --> 00:18:26,002
We're not in trouble, we are trouble.

338
00:18:32,247 --> 00:18:34,886
- Please, please, don't throw us out.
- We'll shut up, we promise.

339
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:37,117
You've promised that
four times tonight.

340
00:18:37,287 --> 00:18:38,322
Sorry, you're gone.

341
00:18:38,487 --> 00:18:41,638
- But what are we gonna tell our dad?
- And my girlfriend?

342
00:18:41,807 --> 00:18:44,799
Maybe you should have thought of that
before you started goofing off.

343
00:18:44,967 --> 00:18:47,037
Okay, okay,
so how does this work, Randy?

344
00:18:47,207 --> 00:18:50,040
You mail us our certificates
of completion or what?

345
00:18:50,487 --> 00:18:53,160
Yeah. Um, let me go get a pen
and paper for your addresses.

346
00:18:53,327 --> 00:18:54,999
Alrighty.

347
00:19:09,727 --> 00:19:12,241
I'm starting to think
he's not coming back.

348
00:19:16,007 --> 00:19:17,440
Not only did we stink at auto class,

349
00:19:17,607 --> 00:19:20,360
we stunk at coasting
through auto class.

350
00:19:20,847 --> 00:19:24,317
We became back-row hooligans,
Niles.

351
00:19:24,487 --> 00:19:27,001
The very students
we hated back in school.

352
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:28,805
I always thought
they were just mean.

353
00:19:28,967 --> 00:19:32,562
Now I realise they were simply
acting out of frustration.

354
00:19:32,727 --> 00:19:36,925
So when Billy Kriezel tried to stuff you
into your locker after math class,

355
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:38,805
he wasn't really mad at you.

356
00:19:38,967 --> 00:19:41,606
He was mad at Pythagoras.

357
00:19:42,567 --> 00:19:44,444
Which is ironic because
a simple volume equation

358
00:19:44,607 --> 00:19:46,643
would have shown him I couldn't fit.

359
00:19:48,767 --> 00:19:52,237
You know, we never should have lied
to Dad and Daphne.

360
00:19:52,407 --> 00:19:55,365
If we wanted to quit,
we should have just quit.

361
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:57,518
Yes, it would have saved us
a lot of embarrassment.

362
00:19:57,687 --> 00:20:01,839
Well, that's the lesson here.
Never deny your true nature.

363
00:20:02,007 --> 00:20:05,477
That's right. Honesty.

364
00:20:05,647 --> 00:20:07,399
This certificate look official enough?

365
00:20:09,207 --> 00:20:10,401
I think you've finally got it.

366
00:20:10,567 --> 00:20:12,159
- Two, please.
- Yeah.
