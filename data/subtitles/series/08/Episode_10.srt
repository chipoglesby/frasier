Well, yes, of course, Roz.
You're the boss.

156
00:07:45,927 --> 00:07:47,519
- Be back in five, everybody.
- Yeah.

157
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:56,637
Listen, let me give you
just one little piece of advice.

158
00:07:56,807 --> 00:08:00,402
I find that when I'm in a leadership
position, the best way to rally my staff...

159
00:08:00,567 --> 00:08:01,716
What staff?

160
00:08:01,887 --> 00:08:04,799
I'm your staff, and I've been listening
to you for eight years.

161
00:08:04,967 --> 00:08:07,162
And I would like for you
to listen to me for a change.

162
00:08:07,327 --> 00:08:10,364
- And I support that.
- Then shut up!

163
00:08:12,527 --> 00:08:13,721
Well...

164
00:08:15,407 --> 00:08:21,118
I'm not sure that's a wise tone to take.
You don't want to lose your narrator.

165
00:08:22,647 --> 00:08:23,875
Is that a threat?

166
00:08:24,047 --> 00:08:25,605
Well,
I'm just saying that alienating me

167
00:08:25,767 --> 00:08:27,997
isn't probably
in the best interest of the show.

168
00:08:28,527 --> 00:08:31,280
Well, maybe the show
would be better off without you.

169
00:08:31,447 --> 00:08:33,597
Well, then,
maybe I should just leave the show.

170
00:08:34,207 --> 00:08:37,404
Well, maybe that's what the show
wants you to do.

171
00:08:37,567 --> 00:08:41,401
Well, then, the show can bite me!

172
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:51,918
I realise I've gone on here a bit, Fred,
so let me try to boil this down for you.

173
00:08:52,087 --> 00:08:54,237
If you want to be a good leader,

174
00:08:54,407 --> 00:08:57,877
you've got to be able to admit
when you're wrong.

175
00:08:58,687 --> 00:09:04,239
No one ever stood so tall
as when he or she...

176
00:09:05,807 --> 00:09:08,560
...stooped to say I'm sorry.

177
00:09:08,727 --> 00:09:12,481
FRED: <i>What's that got to do</i>
<i>with my fear of intimacy?</i>

178
00:09:17,607 --> 00:09:20,804
Which brings to mind
another phrase:

179
00:09:20,967 --> 00:09:26,439
There is none so blind as he or she

180
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:29,599
who will not see.

181
00:09:30,247 --> 00:09:32,522
We'll be right back after the news.

182
00:09:32,687 --> 00:09:34,405
ROZ:
Subtle, Frasier.

183
00:09:34,567 --> 00:09:36,717
But just so you know,
I do not owe you an apology.

184
00:09:36,887 --> 00:09:39,924
You were trying to take over my show
and that's why I fired you.

185
00:09:40,087 --> 00:09:42,555
You did not fire me. I quit.

186
00:09:42,727 --> 00:09:44,160
But at this late date, Roz,

187
00:09:44,327 --> 00:09:46,557
you should be spared the burden
of having to replace me.

188
00:09:46,727 --> 00:09:48,558
So why don't we agree
to put aside our egos

189
00:09:48,727 --> 00:09:50,001
and continue with the programme?

190
00:09:50,567 --> 00:09:53,035
I've already replaced you.

191
00:09:53,967 --> 00:09:57,164
Oh, Roz,
you've gone with an also-ran.

192
00:09:57,327 --> 00:09:58,442
Who is it?

193
00:09:58,607 --> 00:10:00,563
John Glenn.

194
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:03,683
- The astronaut?
- Yes.

195
00:10:03,847 --> 00:10:06,361
- The senator?
- Yes.

196

The John Glenn, American hero.

197
00:10:11,807 --> 00:10:15,561
So I take it there was no one available
with any previous radio experience.

Loosen up, son.

199

That's the way.

200
00:10:28,967 --> 00:10:31,322
Relaxed but firm.

201
00:10:31,487 --> 00:10:35,162
It's not a fight, it's a persuasion.

202

Okay, Dad, I am ready.
I wanna take her to the park.

203
00:10:39,927 --> 00:10:41,406
Out of the question.

204
00:10:41,567 --> 00:10:43,762
Well, I have to practise
in real-life conditions.

205

I can't keep running up
and down the halls.

No, it's too windy.

All right. Well...

208
00:10:50,847 --> 00:10:53,566
Can I at least hang her off the balcony
so we can see how she looks?

209
00:10:53,727 --> 00:10:56,639
Niles,
what kind of dope are you smoking?

210
00:10:57,007 --> 00:10:59,077
The updraft
would pull you off your feet.

211
00:10:59,247 --> 00:11:00,965
You know, you've got a lot to learn.

212
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:05,598
This isn't like driving a car, you know?
It takes practise and concentration.

Hey, Fras.

214
00:11:08,527 --> 00:11:10,882
Did you get things
all patched up with Roz?

215
00:11:11,047 --> 00:11:12,639
On the contrary.

216
00:11:13,127 --> 00:11:15,357
Every time I offer her
an olive branch,

217
00:11:15,527 --> 00:11:21,204
she snaps it in two, sets it on fire
and writes no with the ashes.

218
00:11:21,367 --> 00:11:24,837
She had the temerity
to call me overbearing.

219
00:11:25,687 --> 00:11:28,963
This time, the wound is deep,
my friends, bone deep.

- Well, maybe...
FRASIER: Yes,

221
00:11:30,567 --> 00:11:32,922
sometimes
I am forceful with my opinions,

222
00:11:33,087 --> 00:11:35,442
but that is only because
I'm passionate and right.

223
00:11:35,607 --> 00:11:37,563
And passionate about being right.

224
00:11:38,247 --> 00:11:40,238
Overbearing, as if.

225
00:11:40,407 --> 00:11:43,160
- Well, she probably wants to...
FRASIER: It's insupportable, Dad.

226
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:47,366
She went out and got John Glenn
to replace me.

227
00:11:49,327 --> 00:11:53,400
- The astronaut?
- Yes, yes, the American hero.

228
00:11:53,567 --> 00:11:56,718
- John Glenn, he's perfect.
- Oh, moon dust and starshine, Dad.

229
00:11:56,887 --> 00:11:58,445
Yes, he's been to space.

230
00:11:58,607 --> 00:12:03,476
But does he have the voice,
the savvy, the radio charisma?

231
00:12:03,647 --> 00:12:05,877
Batten down the kite, Niles.

It's really starting
to blow hard in here.

Frasier,
your issues notwithstanding,

234
00:12:13,887 --> 00:12:16,401
getting John Glenn
is quite a coup for Roz.

235
00:12:16,567 --> 00:12:19,365
John Glenn
is just a space-age Band-Aid, Niles.

236
00:12:19,527 --> 00:12:22,599
And Roz is using it to cover up
this enormous authority issue

237
00:12:22,767 --> 00:12:25,520
she has with me,
which she persists in denying.

238
00:12:25,687 --> 00:12:27,678
You're right, Niles,
it's time for action.

239
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:30,407
I've got to show her once and for all
that I am not some meddler

240

And then if we could get some
of the old mission broadcasts,

308
00:16:49,687 --> 00:16:51,723
maybe we could use those
for background.

309
00:16:51,887 --> 00:16:54,242
Definitely.
You are full of great ideas.

310
00:16:54,767 --> 00:16:58,157
No. I'm full of good ideas.

311
00:16:58,327 --> 00:16:59,442
Frasier, what are you doing?

312
00:16:59,607 --> 00:17:01,996
You agreed to two of my suggestions,
which proves your problem

313
00:17:02,167 --> 00:17:05,159
- is with me and not with them.
- I'm sorry. Frasier, get out.

314
00:17:05,327 --> 00:17:07,238
It's all right.
The senator and I are old friends.

315
00:17:07,407 --> 00:17:09,921
I took the liberty of running
a few irresistible ideas by him,

316
00:17:10,087 --> 00:17:11,998
so that I prove my point
and let you come clean.

317
00:17:12,167 --> 00:17:16,001
That's not what you told me.
You used me.

318
00:17:16,167 --> 00:17:17,885
I'm sorry, senator, but if I used you,

319
00:17:18,047 --> 00:17:21,562
it was only as the swift
and terrible sword of justice.

320
00:17:22,247 --> 00:17:25,045
It's terrible, all right. And outrageous.

321
00:17:25,207 --> 00:17:29,758
You said these were your ideas.
Why'd you do it, Senator Glenn?

322
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:33,598
I was misled and I feel awful and...

323
00:17:33,767 --> 00:17:37,726
And you know, it's not like me
to be that underhanded.

324
00:17:38,367 --> 00:17:40,961
It's all right.
Frasier, get in my booth.

325
00:17:44,807 --> 00:17:46,763
I am so sorry, Senator Glenn.

326
00:17:46,927 --> 00:17:50,044
Well, I'm the one that's sorry.
It's my nature to be honest and...

327
00:17:50,207 --> 00:17:52,767
Now, listen up, Roz.
I'm gonna tell you what I did this for.

328
00:17:52,927 --> 00:17:53,962
Back in those glory days,

329
00:17:54,127 --> 00:17:57,597
I was very uncomfortable
when they asked us to say things

330
00:17:57,767 --> 00:18:00,964
that I didn't want to say
and deny other things.

331
00:18:01,127 --> 00:18:02,355
I am so mad at you, Frasier.

332
00:18:02,527 --> 00:18:05,121
FRASIER: Oh, yeah?
Well, I'm mad too, so just bring it on.

333
00:18:05,287 --> 00:18:09,644
Some people ask, you know,
"Were you alone out there?"

334
00:18:09,807 --> 00:18:11,798
We never gave the real answer.

335
00:18:11,967 --> 00:18:16,677
And yet, we've seen things out there,
strange things.

336
00:18:16,847 --> 00:18:19,441
This is my project and I asked you
not to try to take control,

337
00:18:19,607 --> 00:18:21,916
and now you've gone behind my back
and done just that.

338
00:18:22,087 --> 00:18:23,679
But you didn't even give me
a fair shake.

339
00:18:23,847 --> 00:18:25,838
It was because
I was trying to protect myself

340
00:18:26,007 --> 00:18:28,237
because you can be
so bossy sometimes.

341
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:30,841
But we know what we saw out there
and we couldn't...

342
00:18:31,007 --> 00:18:33,237
We couldn't really say anything.

343
00:18:33,407 --> 00:18:34,965
And the bosses were scared of this.

344
00:18:35,127 --> 00:18:37,357
They were afraid
of <i>War of the Worlds</i> type stuff.

345
00:18:37,527 --> 00:18:41,805
And about panic in the streets,
and so we had to keep quiet.

346
00:18:41,967 --> 00:18:44,276
And now we only see
these things in our...

347
00:18:44,447 --> 00:18:49,601
Well, in our nightmares
or maybe in the movies.

348
00:18:49,767 --> 00:18:53,077
And some of them
are pretty close to being the truth.

349
00:18:53,247 --> 00:18:54,680
FRASIER:
All right, Roz,

350
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:58,999
I'll admit that maybe I was
being a little too assertive, all right?

351
00:18:59,167 --> 00:19:02,921
But the least you could do is admit
that perhaps you were a bit defensive.

352
00:19:04,687 --> 00:19:06,200
[WHOOSHING]

353
00:19:07,007 --> 00:19:09,362
Well, maybe you're right.

354
00:19:09,527 --> 00:19:11,119
But it was because
I was trying to prove

355
00:19:11,287 --> 00:19:14,597
that I could do this on my own,
so I was shutting you out.

356
00:19:14,767 --> 00:19:17,839
I admit it.
It was unfair, and I apologise.

357
00:19:18,007 --> 00:19:19,679
Accepted.

358
00:19:19,847 --> 00:19:21,326
Oh, Roz, come on.

359
00:19:21,487 --> 00:19:23,876
Our friendship is more important
to me than this documentary.

360
00:19:24,047 --> 00:19:26,845
Oh, it is to me too, Frasier.

361
00:19:27,487 --> 00:19:31,196
Look, about what I just said
out there,

362
00:19:31,367 --> 00:19:32,800
can we just keep that between us?

363
00:19:32,967 --> 00:19:34,764
Oh, of course, senator.

364
00:19:34,927 --> 00:19:38,078
Good, well...
Wait, you were recording all that?

365
00:19:38,247 --> 00:19:39,805
Yeah, that's okay. We've got plenty.

366
00:19:39,967 --> 00:19:42,117
I'm gonna need that tape.

367
00:19:44,887 --> 00:19:47,321
He's a little tightly wound.

368
00:19:47,487 --> 00:19:50,559
Looks like maybe somebody
should cut back on the old Tang.

369
00:19:52,847 --> 00:19:55,202
- That's a good one, Frasier.
- Oh, thanks, Roz.

370
00:19:56,247 --> 00:19:59,000
Whenever you're ready, senator.

371
00:19:59,167 --> 00:20:00,998
"Since the dawn of time,

372
00:20:01,167 --> 00:20:04,921
man has gazed skyward
and dreamed of reaching the stars..."
