Let me do this my way. Tell him.

310
00:16:16,047 --> 00:16:19,039
He says,
"What are you trying to say?"

311
00:16:19,207 --> 00:16:20,481
Okay.

312
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:22,638
Tell him that another time,

313
00:16:22,807 --> 00:16:26,880
another place,
we might have a shot.

314
00:16:27,047 --> 00:16:29,038
But this just isn't working for me.

315
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:49,561
Is there any chance
you would reconsider?

316
00:16:50,847 --> 00:16:52,439
- I don't think so.
- Uh-huh.

317
00:16:57,887 --> 00:17:00,447
- Is he okay?
- Yes, Roz, he'll be fine.

318
00:17:00,607 --> 00:17:03,485
But, you know, for his sake I think
we should wrap this up, all right?

319
00:17:03,687 --> 00:17:06,360
- Jean-Pierre...
- Roz.

320
00:17:10,447 --> 00:17:12,199
- He says that he'll...
- Please, Frasier.

321
00:17:12,367 --> 00:17:14,403
Some things
don't need to be translated.

322
00:17:24,567 --> 00:17:27,365
So at this point,
what were you thinking?

323
00:17:27,887 --> 00:17:29,479
Stop tape, please.

324
00:17:30,727 --> 00:17:32,763
I'd have been thinking
about that sweet truck.

325
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,565
BARTENDER: Yeah, me too.
- Not me.

326
00:17:34,727 --> 00:17:36,080
If you're focusing on the reward,

327
00:17:36,247 --> 00:17:39,125
that's energy you're not using
to make the shot.

328
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:40,802
MARTIN:
You know what else?

329
00:17:40,967 --> 00:17:42,798
He's donating that truck
to the Police Activities League.

330
00:17:42,967 --> 00:17:44,002
[PATRONS APPLAUDING]

331
00:17:44,167 --> 00:17:47,398
I just want the kids to know
it's about the playoffs, not the payoffs.

332
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:50,400
Is this a great boy or what?

333
00:17:50,567 --> 00:17:52,319
You sure I can't pay you
for this beer?

334
00:17:52,527 --> 00:17:53,562
Your money's no good here.

335
00:17:53,727 --> 00:17:56,958
Half-court Crane's dad
doesn't pay for drinks.

336
00:17:57,647 --> 00:17:59,797
Excuse me, Niles,
but we have a concert to make.

337
00:18:00,007 --> 00:18:02,202
I know, soon. I can't leave
the fellas hanging, Frasier.

338
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:03,686
All right, back to the tape.

339
00:18:03,847 --> 00:18:07,840
All right, now,
that's about 45 feet to that basket.

340
00:18:08,047 --> 00:18:12,484
You see, I used my whole body.
Form is everything.

341
00:18:12,647 --> 00:18:15,081
You've already made
or missed the shot

342
00:18:15,247 --> 00:18:17,841
even before you release the ball.

343
00:18:18,007 --> 00:18:20,123
And, of course,
we all know the rest of the story.

344
00:18:20,527 --> 00:18:21,596
Yes, yes.

345
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,120
The story is:

346
00:18:23,287 --> 00:18:26,040
Once upon a time, Niles Crane
accidentally made a basket.

347
00:18:26,207 --> 00:18:28,198
The end!

348
00:18:29,687 --> 00:18:31,325
I don't deny
there was some luck involved,

349
00:18:31,487 --> 00:18:35,366
but as we all know,
luck is the residue of design.

350
00:18:35,527 --> 00:18:39,805
Please. Somehow managing to hurl
a ball forward is hardly design.

351
00:18:40,007 --> 00:18:44,603
You're just jealous
because I have game and you don't.

352
00:18:45,567 --> 00:18:48,127
Oh, please.
So you think you have game?

353
00:18:48,287 --> 00:18:50,596
- I do have game.
- Do you think they're gonna fight?

354
00:18:50,807 --> 00:18:53,037
I got news for you, they are fighting.

355
00:18:53,247 --> 00:18:55,158
We'll just see about that. Barkeep.

356
00:18:55,327 --> 00:18:56,396
What are you doing?

357
00:18:56,607 --> 00:18:59,758
I'm gonna challenge Niles to a game of
one-on-one on that contraption there.

358
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:01,161
What do you wanna do that for?

359
00:19:01,327 --> 00:19:03,124
Twenty dollars
of your cleanest quarters.

360
00:19:03,327 --> 00:19:04,362
What about your concert?

361
00:19:04,527 --> 00:19:06,040
You guys better get moving.
Tick, tock.

362
00:19:06,247 --> 00:19:08,522
All right, Frasier, game on.

363
00:19:10,487 --> 00:19:14,958
Wait, it's not worth it.
Sports aren't everything.

364
00:19:15,167 --> 00:19:18,045
All right, hotshot, after you.

365
00:19:18,247 --> 00:19:21,045
Let's go half court. Put it up, baby.

366
00:19:21,247 --> 00:19:22,282
Thank you, thank you.

367
00:19:22,447 --> 00:19:26,076
I appreciate the support, but I think
I might throw better with fewer voices.

368
00:19:34,767 --> 00:19:37,725
Well, obviously I'm accustomed
to shooting from further back.

369
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:41,363
Yes, and just once. Allow me.

370
00:19:49,127 --> 00:19:50,401
All right, all right, your turn.

371
00:19:50,607 --> 00:19:53,519
All right.
I believe I'm warmed up now.

372
00:19:59,207 --> 00:20:02,643
Yeah, I hit the round part
and that's worth a half a point.

373
00:20:04,247 --> 00:20:07,683
- I think I could use another beer.
- That will be 2.95.
