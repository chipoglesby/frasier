I bought a new dress.

It's much too expensive,
but you're worth it.

Why are you looking
at each other like that?

We're not looking
at each other like that.

are acting like we're married,

you and I can't be seen together
in public.

168
00:32:23,527 --> 00:32:24,642
It's just until the divorce.

from Mel's point of view,

172
00:32:31,607 --> 00:32:33,006
it really does make a lot of sense.

He came so close.

- I said, "Damn that Mel."

No, you didn't.
You should have, but you didn't.

Sounded to me
like you were taking her side.

All right, could we turn
the clock back two minutes

and pretend this never happened?

179

Why don't we just turn it back
to 10 minutes before my wedding

you're sorry you did this.

For what?

An apology for that unprovoked

You expect me to apologise to you?

Expect it, sir, and demand it.

Well, then here's my answer. No!

- No!

Well, no problem. There's some

that I should be so maligned?

Was I to just sit idly by

Would they have thanked me
for that?

308
00:39:49,087 --> 00:39:50,964
You went to so much trouble.

309
00:39:51,167 --> 00:39:53,237
It wasn't me. It was your brother.

310
00:39:53,447 --> 00:39:56,439
Well, you know me. I hate to butt in.

311
00:39:56,607 --> 00:39:57,926
NILES:
Ohh...

312
00:39:59,127 --> 00:40:03,803
I'd planned to take Daphne to dinner
when suddenly inspiration struck.

313
00:40:03,967 --> 00:40:06,435
Since you two couldn't go
to Au Pied de Cochon this evening,

314
00:40:06,607 --> 00:40:10,077
my faithful companion and I

315
00:40:10,287 --> 00:40:12,323
would bring it to you courtesy
of their caterer.

316
00:40:12,527 --> 00:40:15,325
If dancing at the Starlight Room
was impossible,

317
00:40:15,487 --> 00:40:17,159
we'd give you the real thing.

318
00:40:19,727 --> 00:40:21,365
It's all so overwhelming.

319
00:40:21,567 --> 00:40:23,762
Yeah. Frasier, Dad,
I don't know what to say.

320
00:40:23,967 --> 00:40:26,401
You even got that man
to move his pigeons.

321
00:40:28,087 --> 00:40:29,566
There were no pigeons.

322
00:40:29,887 --> 00:40:31,366
Ohh.

323
00:40:32,047 --> 00:40:33,321
How can we ever thank you two?

324
00:40:33,487 --> 00:40:35,045
Just have a beautiful evening.

325
00:40:35,207 --> 00:40:36,765
I think we can do that.

326
00:40:36,967 --> 00:40:40,118
- And, Frasier, listen...
- Apology accepted, Niles.

327
00:40:40,807 --> 00:40:43,275
Oh, just remember to give
the lingonberry sauce a little stir...

328
00:40:43,487 --> 00:40:45,364
MARTIN:
They can figure it out.

329
00:40:46,007 --> 00:40:47,520
Right.

330
00:40:52,647 --> 00:40:55,639
- Daphne, about today...
- Let's just forget about that.

331
00:40:55,807 --> 00:40:57,160
Why don't we start from here?

332
00:40:57,367 --> 00:40:59,358
I would love that.

333
00:41:00,167 --> 00:41:02,761
- To us.
- To us.

334
00:41:15,767 --> 00:41:18,281
I'm usually so nervous
on a first date,

335
00:41:18,447 --> 00:41:20,358
but not tonight.

336
00:41:21,607 --> 00:41:22,926
Would you like to dance?

337
00:41:23,127 --> 00:41:24,560
Oh, I'd love to.

338
00:41:36,087 --> 00:41:37,645
So where are you from?

339
00:41:37,807 --> 00:41:40,480
- Manchester, England.
- Oh, my.

340
00:41:40,647 --> 00:41:42,717
- Big family?
- Hideously.

341
00:41:42,887 --> 00:41:44,206

DAPHNE:
And you?

343
00:41:45,567 --> 00:41:47,603
I'm from a small mountain village
in Tibet.

344

[DAPHNE CHUCKLING]

345
00:41:49,127 --> 00:41:52,005
Tenzing Norgay used
to carry me to school.

346
00:41:52,167 --> 00:41:54,601
You know what
I've always wondered?

347
00:41:54,767 --> 00:41:56,997
- Think I can guess?
- Yeah.
