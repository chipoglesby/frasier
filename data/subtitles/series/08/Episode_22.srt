I would like to close the show today
with a truly inspirational tale.

2
00:00:13,007 --> 00:00:16,602
One year ago,
a very successful friend of mine

3
00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:18,758
was struck by tragedy.

4
00:00:19,687 --> 00:00:24,238
Prognosis: Not good. Hope: Slim.

5
00:00:24,407 --> 00:00:30,516
But armed with only fortitude,
this friend of mine fought back.

6
00:00:30,687 --> 00:00:34,680
I'm talking about the reopening of
Seattle's finest restaurant, Chez Henri.

7
00:00:35,207 --> 00:00:36,435
Just goes to show you

8
00:00:36,607 --> 00:00:41,158
that a four-alarm fire
is no match for five-star courage.

9
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:46,240
This is Frasier Crane saying good day
and good mental health.

10

You still don't have a table
for opening night.

11
00:00:48,607 --> 00:00:50,165
And it's killing me.

12
00:00:50,767 --> 00:00:52,644
Okay, everyone, it's showtime.

13
00:00:52,807 --> 00:00:55,480
The new station owner's
on his way down. So look alive.

14
00:00:55,647 --> 00:00:57,399
Watch what you say,
watch what you don't say.

15
00:00:57,567 --> 00:00:59,398
Don't say too much,
don't say too little.

16

set at anyway?

18

a million times.

19

What'll it be today, Roz?

20
00:01:08,167 --> 00:01:10,556

or our salute to teamwork?

21
00:01:10,727 --> 00:01:12,046
Yeah, yeah, very funny.

22
00:01:12,207 --> 00:01:14,846
Come on, Kenny. You know
how these people come and go.

23
00:01:15,007 --> 00:01:16,884
They introduce themselves,
they shake your hand,

24
00:01:17,047 --> 00:01:18,878
tell us they're big fans
and then they're gone.

25

Nothing every changes.
So don't worry about it.

the brightest stars of Silicon Valley.

I love the theme weeks,
but I was really into Follow-Up Fridays,

39

when you had previous callers call in
to let you know how they're doing.

40

- Why did you stop doing that?
- Oh, well, it wasn't my idea.

41

You know, Todd,
seeing as how you are such a big fan,

42
00:02:10,367 --> 00:02:12,005
perhaps I could bend your ear
sometime

43

about a few ideas I have
for the show.

Great. I'd love to hear them.

Well, how about later today, perhaps?

- Cool indeed.

- Right.

And may I say it's truly an honour
to be serving under your leadership.

indeed for radio itself.

Phase one?

Well, Niles, it occurred to me
that if we end things now,

You, sir, are a complete drunk.

304
00:15:59,687 --> 00:16:02,155
- Niles, how could you...?
- Well...

305
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:04,725
How could you know?

306
00:16:06,047 --> 00:16:08,481
I thought I was hiding it so well.

307
00:16:10,447 --> 00:16:13,120
I have a problem. It's time I face it.

308
00:16:13,727 --> 00:16:17,481
I've been meaning to say something,
but I didn't have the courage.

309
00:16:17,647 --> 00:16:21,526
Not like Niles.
You're a good person.

310
00:16:23,127 --> 00:16:25,641
I'm getting help first thing tomorrow.

311
00:16:25,807 --> 00:16:28,002
I'm so sorry, baby.

312
00:16:29,167 --> 00:16:31,635
Thank you
for giving me my husband back.

313
00:16:34,247 --> 00:16:36,841
Mel, darling, you married an angel.

314
00:16:38,007 --> 00:16:40,157
Don't I know it.

315
00:16:46,207 --> 00:16:50,041
Ah. Dad, what do you think
of the new look?

316
00:16:50,447 --> 00:16:54,838
Nice stuff.
You really tied the flow to the motif.

317
00:16:56,647 --> 00:16:57,841
Thanks for trying.

318
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:00,678
- Well, shall we give it a test run?
- Yeah.

Dad.

00:17:57,447 --> 00:17:59,597
Looks great, son.

323
00:18:00,847 --> 00:18:03,839
- There's nothing here.
- I know.

324
00:18:05,247 --> 00:18:08,762
I give up.
I've tried a million combinations.

325
00:18:09,527 --> 00:18:14,476
I even had early Byzantine
mingling with mid-century Danish.

Will they ever get along?

327
00:18:17,687 --> 00:18:21,236
The only furniture that looks good
in my apartment is my own.

Well, I could have told you that
three love seats ago.

00:18:23,647 --> 00:18:26,320
So what are you waiting for?
Go bring it back.

330
00:18:30,007 --> 00:18:32,123
Well, I'm glad I went
to three different stores

331
00:18:32,287 --> 00:18:34,198
to find your organic furniture polish.

332
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:36,927
Well, Daphne, chin up. You can
always use it to polish the floors.

Oh, yes. When God closes a door,
he opens a window.

334
00:18:42,807 --> 00:18:44,718
You know, Dad,
even if I do get my furniture back,

335
00:18:44,887 --> 00:18:46,161
it doesn't solve anything.

336
00:18:46,327 --> 00:18:49,842
There's still someone downstairs
with my apartment.

337
00:18:50,007 --> 00:18:52,316
That's not your apartment.
This is your apartment.

And if every stooge
in the building rips you off,

339
00:18:55,007 --> 00:18:58,238
it doesn't take anything away from you,
because you were the original.

340
00:19:04,287 --> 00:19:05,720
I am, aren't I?

341
00:19:06,727 --> 00:19:08,604
And I did, after all, create that look,

342
00:19:08,767 --> 00:19:10,758
and that should be
gratification enough.

The only person who's ever gonna see
that apartment

348
00:19:19,527 --> 00:19:21,916
is probably the Pizza Hut

- Todd, come on in.
- Hey, Fras.

00:19:26,047 --> 00:19:29,039
I just need to know the name
of the chick who made our couch.

Oh, right. It's a reproduction
