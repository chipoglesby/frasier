DAPHNE: Hello.
NILES: Hey.

3
00:00:11,047 --> 00:00:12,560
Ah, the weekend warriors
have returned.

4
00:00:12,727 --> 00:00:15,605
You better watch out, Dr. Crane.
I'm getting pretty good at kickboxing.

5
00:00:15,767 --> 00:00:19,555
It's true, it's true. She hits so hard,
they call her the British Pound.

6
00:00:20,207 --> 00:00:22,323
You hit pretty hard yourself there,
Nails.

7
00:00:22,887 --> 00:00:24,878
I'm gonna hop in the shower.

8
00:00:25,047 --> 00:00:28,323
- Nails?
- Oh, you scratch one guy...

9
00:00:29,207 --> 00:00:31,801
Oh, my electrolytes are plummeting.
Care to join me in a sherry?

10
00:00:31,967 --> 00:00:34,720
Well, actually, I'd love to, Niles,
but I'm off to see Dr. Tewksbury.

11
00:00:34,887 --> 00:00:37,640
Oh. I didn't realise
your mentor was still in town.

12
00:00:37,807 --> 00:00:39,638
Yes, and because of it,
I've been the recipient

13
00:00:39,807 --> 00:00:42,480
of some informal therapy.
It's really been quite enlightening.

14
00:00:42,647 --> 00:00:45,844
You know, I consider myself lucky
to be in the hands of such a master.

15
00:00:46,047 --> 00:00:47,036
NILES:
Mm.

16
00:00:47,207 --> 00:00:49,596
Well, I'm happy for you, Frasier.
He is a gifted psychiatrist.

17
00:00:49,767 --> 00:00:52,122
Even if I don't share
your godlike worship of him.

18
00:00:52,287 --> 00:00:55,438
Well, I simply have
a healthy respect for the man, Niles.

19
00:00:55,927 --> 00:00:57,042
It's hardly worship.

20
00:00:57,207 --> 00:01:01,120
Oh, please. You're one step away from
seeing his image appear in a tortilla.

21
00:01:01,567 --> 00:01:05,003
- Niles, thank heavens you're still here.
- Uh, what's wrong?

22
00:01:05,167 --> 00:01:07,283
- You can't go to Nervosa today.
- Why not?

23
00:01:07,447 --> 00:01:09,961
I had a psychic vision that
something bad's gonna happen to you.

24
00:01:10,127 --> 00:01:12,925
- Oh, come on, Daphne.
- Niles, I'm serious.

25
00:01:13,087 --> 00:01:15,476
I know you don't believe in visions,
but it's important to me.

26
00:01:15,647 --> 00:01:16,716
Promise me you won't go.

27
00:01:17,447 --> 00:01:20,245
Well, all right, if it means
that much to you, I won't go.

28
00:01:20,407 --> 00:01:21,999
- I'll go straight home.
- Thank you.

29
00:01:22,167 --> 00:01:24,965
I feel much better.
I'll see you later.

30
00:01:27,207 --> 00:01:29,801
Wow, that was scary.

31
00:01:30,567 --> 00:01:32,159
Don't tell me
you believe in that stuff.

No, I mean the way
she can manipulate you like that.

Oh, been on a shopping spree,
I see.

38
00:01:50,087 --> 00:01:53,159
Yes, Alice is visiting her grandmother
for the week.

- So I finally have some time to myself.
- Oh.

It is great shopping without her
pulling down a display rack.

41

Not only that, I actually woke up today
without someone jumping on my bed

00:02:03,687 --> 00:02:05,803
and sticking her little fingers
up my nose.

And I didn't have to spend
half the morning

out of that little girl's curls.

did you read the article
on behaviour modification...?

happened if you hadn't shown up.

No. No, she's not his patient.
She's his girlfriend.

Oh, well, in that case,
no matter who's right or wrong,

Ever since his divorce, I'm sure

Are you sorry for breaking

I'm sorry for breaking my promise.

- Well, it wasn't a premonition.
- It certainly was.

Something a little more scientific

Frasier brought over some work

been seeing each other?

169

Well, um, the other day at Nervosa,
we really hit it off after you left,

170
00:08:03,287 --> 00:08:04,766
and, uh, he asked me to dinner.

I'm a bit surprised.

Why? He's smart.

00:08:12,167 --> 00:08:14,965
Very insightful.
And he's such a great listener.

Yes, well, I'm happy for you, Roz.

I hope it wasn't too awkward
seeing me with Roz last night.

182
00:08:43,927 --> 00:08:49,559
Not at all. It's just a little... jarring
to see you out of context that way.

183
00:08:49,727 --> 00:08:50,876
- Yeah.
- It's just...

Now, last time
we had just broached the subject

188
00:09:02,447 --> 00:09:07,475
of your father's expectations and
their effect on your early adulthood.

189
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:11,560
As we know, ahem,
the internalisation

190
00:09:12,167 --> 00:09:13,998
of a parent's moral code

191
00:09:14,167 --> 00:09:16,727
is crucial to the development
of the superego.

192
00:09:16,887 --> 00:09:20,482
And considering
your father's strictness...

193
00:09:21,487 --> 00:09:22,806
Frasier, is everything all right?

194

Yes, yes, of course.
Of course. Please, continue.

195
00:09:26,847 --> 00:09:28,246
You must admit
that having a father

196
00:09:28,407 --> 00:09:32,082
whose very occupation
is the enforcement of the moral code

197
00:09:32,247 --> 00:09:35,603
would lead
to an overdeveloped superego.

on this subject.

Throughout the entire session,

211
00:10:27,047 --> 00:10:30,756
I just couldn't focus
on anything he was saying.

Wasn't he talking about you?

213
00:10:32,647 --> 00:10:36,879
Yes, yes, but recently,
I saw him in...

214
00:10:37,367 --> 00:10:41,326
Well, a less than dignified light.

215
00:10:41,487 --> 00:10:46,197
And, uh, ever since, I've just found it
impossible to take him seriously.

216
00:10:46,367 --> 00:10:48,597
I know exactly
what you're talking about.

217
00:10:48,767 --> 00:10:52,442
In Korea, I had this commanding
officer, Lieutenant Franks.

218
00:10:52,607 --> 00:10:55,758
I would have followed that guy
into the gates of hell.

219

I saw him a few years later.

He was flipping hamburgers
in a fast-food place.

221
00:11:01,047 --> 00:11:02,480
Now, that was hard to handle.

222
00:11:02,647 --> 00:11:06,117
I mean, this guy took me
under his wing and moulded me.

223
00:11:06,287 --> 00:11:08,517
- Like a mentor.
- Yeah, exactly.

224
00:11:08,687 --> 00:11:12,566
He always used to say that one day
he'd be taking orders from me.

225
00:11:12,727 --> 00:11:15,639
Just never thought
it would be for extra onions.

226
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:17,764
So how did you handle it?

227
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:20,725
Well, I just realised
that it was my problem, not his.

228
00:11:20,887 --> 00:11:23,242
And I wasn't going to let that erase
all he meant to me.

229
00:11:23,407 --> 00:11:27,195
So I just marched right back
into that kitchen and saluted him.

230
00:11:27,647 --> 00:11:30,719
And after we were talking for a while,
I realised nothing had changed.

231
00:11:30,887 --> 00:11:34,038
He was still the same
hard-charging man's man

to get his hands dirty.

I'm sorry, Dr. Morey,

let's start with our last session.

313

As I recall,
you were having difficulty

getting rid of a certain image
in your mind.

315

- That is correct.
- Mm-hm.

Well, perhaps
we should confront that.

Oh, dear Lord.
I assumed that was Roz's.

318
00:15:50,007 --> 00:15:52,805
It is.
I was at her apartment this morning.

319
00:15:52,967 --> 00:15:54,958
I started thinking
about your issue with the robe,

320
00:15:55,127 --> 00:15:57,641
and I decided to bring it with me.

321
00:15:57,807 --> 00:16:02,756
Now, Frasier, ahem, you consider me
a competent psychiatrist, don't you?

322
00:16:02,927 --> 00:16:04,360
Of course I do.

323
00:16:04,527 --> 00:16:06,722
Does seeing me dressed like this
diminish that?

324
00:16:06,887 --> 00:16:07,956
No. Of course not.

325
00:16:08,127 --> 00:16:10,687
It's just, well,
I know on a conscious level,

326
00:16:10,847 --> 00:16:13,759
that the garment
does not change who you are.

327
00:16:13,927 --> 00:16:17,283
But on an unconscious level,
I'm all weirded out.

328
00:16:17,447 --> 00:16:20,962
I mean, you're my mentor
and you're wearing Roz's robe.

329
00:16:21,127 --> 00:16:26,155
- I'm still the same person.
- Yes, but it's Roz's robe.

330
00:16:26,327 --> 00:16:29,478
And what does Roz's robe
signify to you?

331
00:16:29,647 --> 00:16:31,956
- Roz.
- Well...

332
00:16:32,127 --> 00:16:34,277
Then maybe this isn't
about you and me.

333
00:16:34,447 --> 00:16:38,281
Maybe this is about
your relationship with Roz.

334
00:16:38,447 --> 00:16:41,837
Seeing me dressed like this
brings up deep feelings.

Don't be afraid of those feelings.

in your robe.

the toppling of a hero.

there may be something special
