Hey, Frasier, what are you doing
over the Christmas weekend?

Well, Roz,
if you insist on interrogating me,

155
00:07:56,127 --> 00:07:59,085
I'll be co-hosting the Seattle
Christmas Parade tomorrow night

on Channel 6 with the lovely
and talented Kelly Kirkland.

157
00:08:03,167 --> 00:08:06,239
I hope it'll be the beginning
of a new holiday tradition.

Good mental health, Seattle.
See you at the parade.

Her word is good enough for me.

That woman grew up in Seattle.
She's never seen that parade.

183

It's a sacrilege. God, you know,
this event, it's an institution.

It carries with it a tradition
of pride and pageantry

and old-fashioned good times.

You know, that's not bad.
I think I might open with it.

this is not some sort of a home movie.

without Ballantine.

Is anything the same to you

Christmas is days off, but Daphne and
I were wondering if it wouldn't be good

201

for you to open
one of your presents early.

it's an honour to be sitting here

that were once occupied

by the legendary Bob Vernon
and his co-host Sergeant Michelle,

237
00:12:12,447 --> 00:12:15,120
that started this tradition
so many years ago.

And here comes our first float,
Frosty the Snowman.

239
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:21,999
You know, Mary,
historically speaking,

240
00:12:22,167 --> 00:12:25,557
the first float was probably
the Trojan horse,

241
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:28,116
which was a gift
to the people of Troy.

242
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:29,959
Once brought inside the city walls,
however,

243
00:12:30,127 --> 00:12:32,516
they discovered it was filled
with Greek soldiers

244
00:12:32,687 --> 00:12:35,360
who slaughtered their Trojan enemies
in the street.

245
00:12:35,527 --> 00:12:39,042
Of course, modern floats
have come a long way since then.

Managua, Nicaragua.

251
00:12:51,647 --> 00:12:54,241
Sounds like the name
of a fine Latino man.

Would you like to dance, Dr. Mary?
Yes, I would, Managua Nicaragua.

sticking to the script.

Instead,
Mary prattles on endlessly

as if every idea in her head
is worth saying out loud.

00:15:19,607 --> 00:15:22,167
SANTA: Ho, ho, ho, ho.
Ho, ho, ho.

304
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:24,005
Well, hello, young man.

305
00:15:24,167 --> 00:15:26,317
Some call him Saint Nick,
others Kris Kringle.

306
00:15:26,487 --> 00:15:28,398
In Holland,
he's affectionately known...

307
00:15:28,567 --> 00:15:30,683
SANTA:
Oh, you must be Dr. Mary.

308
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:33,361
You know,
I've been meaning to call your show.

309
00:15:33,527 --> 00:15:36,485
My elves always seem to get
a little blue when the work is done

310
00:15:36,647 --> 00:15:38,478
and, well,
I thought maybe you could help.

311
00:15:38,647 --> 00:15:40,399
Oh, Santa.

312
00:15:40,567 --> 00:15:42,444
Santa, I've got some questions
over here for you.

313
00:15:42,607 --> 00:15:44,757
Well, let's all see
if we can put our heads together

314
00:15:44,927 --> 00:15:46,883
and come up with a solution.

315
00:15:47,047 --> 00:15:50,926
Kids, do you think that Dr. Mary
can help Santa to cheer up his elves?

316
00:15:51,087 --> 00:15:53,442
CROWD:
Yes!

317
00:15:53,607 --> 00:15:55,643
Well, why don't you give them
some candy?

318
00:15:55,807 --> 00:15:59,720
- Oh, now, that's a great idea.
- No, that's a terrible idea.

319
00:15:59,887 --> 00:16:02,481
Your elves are probably suffering
from seasonal affective disorder.

320
00:16:02,647 --> 00:16:05,605
Now, loading them up with sweets
will only aggravate the problem.

321
00:16:05,767 --> 00:16:09,555
But Mary's right. Kids love candy.

322
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:12,036
Elves are not kids. They're tiny men.

323
00:16:13,727 --> 00:16:16,366
- Well, if you want my opinion...
FRASIER: No, thank you, Mary.

324
00:16:16,527 --> 00:16:17,516
We've been listening,

325
00:16:17,687 --> 00:16:19,996
and frankly, there isn't room
left in our heads for another.

326
00:16:20,167 --> 00:16:22,920
Now, if you would just
get back to the dais...

327
00:16:23,087 --> 00:16:25,157
- I'm so sorry.
- What the hell's wrong with you?

328
00:16:25,327 --> 00:16:27,716
- Look, I'm bleeding. I'm bleeding.
- It was an accident.

329
00:16:27,887 --> 00:16:29,525
- I'm dizzy.
FRASIER: Here. Sit down.

330
00:16:29,687 --> 00:16:32,247
Cut to tape. I don't care what tape.
Find something.

331
00:16:32,407 --> 00:16:34,284
What's wrong with you?
You attacked Santa Claus.

332
00:16:34,447 --> 00:16:37,280
Well, it was an accident,
wasn't it, Mary? You saw it.

333
00:16:37,447 --> 00:16:39,677
Oh, now you want my opinion.
Honey, you're on your own.

334
00:16:45,687 --> 00:16:48,724
- Hello, Mary.
- Hello.

335
00:16:48,887 --> 00:16:50,445
Any word on Santa?

336
00:16:50,607 --> 00:16:53,360
Oh, he'll be all right.
They gave him a coagulant.

337
00:16:57,807 --> 00:17:00,082
I'd like to apologise
for the way I acted toward you.

338
00:17:00,247 --> 00:17:03,159
It was rude and disrespectful.

339
00:17:03,327 --> 00:17:05,557
Well, what did I do
to make you treat me that way?

340
00:17:06,767 --> 00:17:09,918
Well, it's just that doing this parade
has been a dream of mine,

341
00:17:10,087 --> 00:17:13,363
and it felt like
you were taking that away from me.

342
00:17:13,527 --> 00:17:16,405
- What do you mean? We were a team.
- Oh, yeah.

343
00:17:16,567 --> 00:17:19,400
I was the boring stiff guy
and you were the one everybody loved.

344
00:17:19,567 --> 00:17:22,240
- Oh, come on, now.
- No, it's true, Mary.

345
00:17:22,407 --> 00:17:26,639
This town has taken you into its heart
in a way that they never have with me.

346
00:17:26,807 --> 00:17:28,638
I guess I'm a little jealous of that.

347
00:17:28,967 --> 00:17:31,322
Oh, Frasier, if it helps, I forgive you.

348
00:17:32,127 --> 00:17:35,642
You know, when you're not trying so
hard, you're kind of loveable yourself.

349
00:17:35,807 --> 00:17:36,956
Really?

350
00:17:38,887 --> 00:17:41,720
Would I be overstepping my bounds

351
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:45,846
if I were to ask
for some sugar right now?

352
00:17:47,047 --> 00:17:48,844
Come on.

353
00:17:50,447 --> 00:17:52,039
Merry Christmas, Frasier.

354
00:17:52,207 --> 00:17:53,799
Merry Christmas, Mary.

355
00:17:54,487 --> 00:17:56,284
- I'm gonna get on out of here.
- Right, right.

356
00:17:56,447 --> 00:17:57,675
I'd offer to walk you,

357
00:17:57,847 --> 00:18:00,486
but there's still some angry parents
in the parking lot.

358
00:18:00,647 --> 00:18:03,923
- Oh. Okay.
- Bye-bye.

359
00:18:11,287 --> 00:18:14,597
MAN: Excuse me.
- You can just sweep around me.

360
00:18:14,767 --> 00:18:19,238
No, I wanna introduce myself.
I'm Bob Vernon.

361
00:18:25,007 --> 00:18:26,042
Bo...

362
00:18:26,207 --> 00:18:29,483
- Bob Vernon?
- That's right.

363
00:18:30,047 --> 00:18:33,039
- Oh, it's an honour, sir.
- Thank you.

364
00:18:33,207 --> 00:18:36,756
Say, you didn't watch the parade
this evening, did you?

365
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:38,565
I turned it off
when the smelling salts

366
00:18:38,727 --> 00:18:41,764
started making Santa nauseous.

367
00:18:43,447 --> 00:18:45,358
You know, Frasier,

368
00:18:45,527 --> 00:18:49,998
I got off to a rather rough start
in this parade myself.

369
00:18:50,167 --> 00:18:52,317
- You did?
- Mm. Oh, yes.

370
00:18:52,487 --> 00:18:56,321
Now, Sergeant Michelle and I had
absolutely no rapport that first year.

371
00:18:56,487 --> 00:18:59,559
- No.
- Well, frankly, she got on my nerves.

372
00:18:59,727 --> 00:19:02,799
You know,
she wasn't a real sergeant.

373
00:19:03,527 --> 00:19:04,960
No.

374
00:19:05,687 --> 00:19:09,521
Listen, son,
try to lighten up on yourself.

375
00:19:09,687 --> 00:19:12,485
You did some real nice work
out there today.

376
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:18,362
- Thanks.
- Good luck.

377
00:19:19,967 --> 00:19:22,197
- Say, Mr. Vernon?
- Yeah?

378
00:19:22,847 --> 00:19:25,281
Is there any chance

379
00:19:25,807 --> 00:19:28,958
that you'd like to join me
in a little banter?

380
00:19:29,927 --> 00:19:31,406
It would be an honour.

Have you ever seen 80 beavers
march in perfect rhythm?

385
00:19:46,167 --> 00:19:49,318
Frasier, everyone knows
beavers can't march.

386
00:19:49,487 --> 00:19:51,478
They can when they're
the Marching Beavers
