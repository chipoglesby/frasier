312
00:15:44,087 --> 00:15:46,203
Oh, yeah, I'm gonna hit you.

313
00:15:46,367 --> 00:15:48,085
I'm gonna hit you
with tortious interference

314
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:50,636
and intentionally negligent infliction
of emotional distress.

315
00:15:50,807 --> 00:15:53,401
In layman's terms,
I'm gonna sue your ass off.

316
00:15:53,607 --> 00:15:56,724
Me? But... But Daphne's the one
who left you at the altar.

317
00:15:56,887 --> 00:15:59,685
That's right. That's why I'm suing her
for breach of contract.

318
00:16:00,247 --> 00:16:02,158
Listen, you're just being
emotional right now.

319
00:16:02,327 --> 00:16:05,080
Give this a few days
and I'm sure you'll feel much better.

320
00:16:05,287 --> 00:16:07,039
Actually, I'm feeling a lot better,
thank you.

321
00:16:07,207 --> 00:16:08,959
Suing you is just the tonic
that I needed.

322
00:16:09,487 --> 00:16:11,876
You know what else? I'm starving.
I haven't eaten in 24 hours.

323
00:16:12,047 --> 00:16:15,278
I'd ask you to join me,
but you should be saving your money.

324
00:16:16,047 --> 00:16:18,322
Turn the lights out when you leave.

325
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:20,922
Oh, by the way, Fras.

326
00:16:21,607 --> 00:16:24,041
Who's Mr. Chump now?

327
00:16:27,887 --> 00:16:29,036
Where is Mel?

328
00:16:29,207 --> 00:16:31,516
That woman is punctual to a fault.
This is a bad sign.

329
00:16:31,687 --> 00:16:32,881
She's only five minutes late.

330
00:16:33,087 --> 00:16:35,726
Five? I thought it was two.

331
00:16:36,327 --> 00:16:39,205
She's doing this intentionally.
She's playing mind games.

332
00:16:39,367 --> 00:16:41,198
She's hoping to undermine
my confidence

333
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:42,846
so she'll have the advantage.

334
00:16:43,047 --> 00:16:44,275
Yeah, but you're showing her.

335
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:47,396
I'm sorry I'm late.
What's wrong with Niles?

336
00:16:47,567 --> 00:16:49,125
Oh, he's in a tizzy
because Mel's late.

337
00:16:49,327 --> 00:16:50,476
Dear God, she's never late.

338
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:52,006
[NILES GASPING]

339
00:16:52,167 --> 00:16:53,316
Steady, Niles.

340
00:16:53,487 --> 00:16:55,478
Nice job, Frasier.

341
00:16:55,687 --> 00:16:57,245
So how did things go with Donny?

342
00:16:57,447 --> 00:16:59,039
I used every psychological trick
in my bag

343
00:16:59,207 --> 00:17:00,606
to get myself added to the lawsuit.

344
00:17:00,767 --> 00:17:02,758
NILES: That's unforgivable.
- Tell me about it.

No, that prune Danish

346
00:17:04,407 --> 00:17:07,763
that Dad dropped down here
last Thursday is still here.

347

- Oh, I think I see Mel pulling in.
NILES: Don't panic. Oh!

348
00:17:11,767 --> 00:17:13,997
Thanks for the moral support.
Don't let her see you here.

349
00:17:14,167 --> 00:17:16,442
- If you need us, we'll be right up there.
- Thanks.

350
00:17:21,727 --> 00:17:23,001
Hello, Mel.

351
00:17:23,527 --> 00:17:24,755
Niles.

352
00:17:25,527 --> 00:17:27,006
Please.

353
00:17:32,287 --> 00:17:35,006
Well, here we are,

354
00:17:35,207 --> 00:17:37,880
our four-day anniversary.

355
00:17:38,727 --> 00:17:40,957
- Mel, I never meant to...
- What, hurt me?

356
00:17:41,167 --> 00:17:42,202
If that were the case,

357
00:17:42,367 --> 00:17:45,439
you never would have run off
with your little maid-whore

358
00:17:45,607 --> 00:17:48,599
leaving me holding the brochures
to our honeymoon.

359
00:17:49,167 --> 00:17:50,759
Technically,
she's a physical therapist.

360
00:17:53,287 --> 00:17:55,676
- You were saying?
- If you think that l...

361
00:17:55,847 --> 00:17:59,476
- Oh, Mel. Here, here.
- No!

362
00:18:02,727 --> 00:18:06,003
I promised myself I wouldn't cry.
Damn it.

363
00:18:07,807 --> 00:18:10,241
I want you to listen to me
very carefully.

364
00:18:10,447 --> 00:18:12,802
Last night, as I lay in bed, awake,

365
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:17,677
I thought I'm either going to kill you
or I'm going to kill myself.

366
00:18:18,167 --> 00:18:19,885
Well, here you are,
so I guess that leaves...

367
00:18:20,047 --> 00:18:21,605
MEL:
Will you shut up and let me finish?

368
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,803
I realised that wouldn't
solve anything.

369
00:18:23,967 --> 00:18:26,720
So I've decided to make this
as painless as possible.

370
00:18:26,887 --> 00:18:30,357
You will have your divorce, Niles,
and it will be quick and clean.

371
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,596
That's very generous.

372
00:18:31,767 --> 00:18:33,723
Hold your applause.
There are some conditions.

373
00:18:34,247 --> 00:18:35,680
As you know,
I have a certain standing

374
00:18:35,847 --> 00:18:37,678
in my social circle
that's important to me.

375
00:18:37,847 --> 00:18:41,965
And having my husband of three days
run off with some Cockney tart

376
00:18:42,127 --> 00:18:43,924
is a humiliation I'd prefer to avoid.

377
00:18:44,127 --> 00:18:46,800
- Yes, I understand completely.
- Here's how this is gonna play out.

378
00:18:47,007 --> 00:18:48,042
For the next few weeks,

379
00:18:48,207 --> 00:18:49,959
as far as the rest of the world
is concerned,

380
00:18:50,127 --> 00:18:52,083
- we're still happily married.
- Check.

381
00:18:52,247 --> 00:18:54,841
We will appear together in public
at various social occasions.

382
00:18:55,047 --> 00:18:56,275
- Check.
- In private,

383
00:18:56,487 --> 00:18:57,681
I don't wanna lay eyes on you.

384
00:18:57,887 --> 00:18:59,036
Check, check.

385
00:18:59,207 --> 00:19:03,678
And when a suitable amount of time
has passed, I will file for divorce.

386
00:19:04,687 --> 00:19:07,963
Well, it seems like
you've thought of everything.

387
00:19:08,167 --> 00:19:11,398
I have. Here's the watch I was
going to give you as a wedding gift.

388
00:19:11,927 --> 00:19:13,679
Please wear it when we're together.

389
00:19:14,247 --> 00:19:15,805
It's, uh...

390
00:19:15,967 --> 00:19:18,003
Yes, it said "Forever yours", l...

391
00:19:18,167 --> 00:19:21,000
I scratched it out with a screwdriver.

392
00:19:23,047 --> 00:19:25,481
There's something else
crudely carved here.

393
00:19:25,647 --> 00:19:30,038
Ah. Well, at least you were able to use
that F from "forever."

394
00:19:32,247 --> 00:19:33,839
Maybe it's not gonna be
so bad after all.

395
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:35,520
She just gave him a watch.

396
00:19:35,687 --> 00:19:38,281
Isn't this all too typical?

397
00:19:38,447 --> 00:19:40,642
Niles leaves his wife
for another woman, he gets a gift.

398
00:19:40,807 --> 00:19:43,924
I try to do the right thing,
I get Mr. Chump and a lawsuit.

399
00:19:45,447 --> 00:19:47,483
Frasier, I know you thought
it was for the best,

400
00:19:47,647 --> 00:19:50,115
but I told you not to go see Donny,
didn't I?

401
00:19:50,287 --> 00:19:51,322
Yes, you did.

402
00:19:51,487 --> 00:19:53,523
- But you went down there, didn't you?
- Yes, I did.

403
00:19:53,687 --> 00:19:55,405
I told you not to screw around
with lawyers.

404
00:19:55,567 --> 00:19:57,000
All right, Dad.

405
00:19:57,407 --> 00:19:59,841
- I told him not to go down there.
- Will you shut up?

406
00:20:00,687 --> 00:20:02,598
All right, there she goes.

407
00:20:04,487 --> 00:20:06,079
So, Niles?

408
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:09,523
Well, um, all things considered,
not so bad.

409
00:20:09,727 --> 00:20:11,763
In exchange for a neat
and tidy divorce,

410
00:20:11,927 --> 00:20:14,282
all I have to do
is play the doting husband

411
00:20:14,447 --> 00:20:17,996
at some social functions
for a few weeks.

412
00:20:18,207 --> 00:20:19,481
Well, that doesn't sound so bad.

413
00:20:19,687 --> 00:20:21,086
What kind of social functions?

414
00:20:21,247 --> 00:20:25,525
Well, for instance,
tonight is our wedding reception.

415
00:20:26,607 --> 00:20:27,881
FRASIER:
Dear God.

416
00:20:28,087 --> 00:20:31,238
Well, since we eloped,
some of Mel's colleagues

417
00:20:31,407 --> 00:20:35,639
decided to throw a little last-minute
get-together to toast our nuptials.

418
00:20:35,807 --> 00:20:38,082
Well, after Donny gets
through with Frasier,

419
00:20:38,247 --> 00:20:41,444
you won't be the only one having
your nuptials toasted.

420
00:20:46,607 --> 00:20:48,245
Explain to me again
how you and Mel

421
00:20:48,407 --> 00:20:50,557
masquerading as husband and wife
is a good thing?

422
00:20:50,727 --> 00:20:53,400
- Well...
- If I may, Daphne,

423
00:20:53,607 --> 00:20:55,438
it's basically to give Mel
a little wiggle room

424
00:20:55,607 --> 00:20:57,962
so she can get out this debacle
with her dignity intact.

425
00:20:58,167 --> 00:21:00,123
Well, what about Niles's dignity?

426
00:21:00,327 --> 00:21:02,557
Well, Maris got that in the divorce.
Ha-ha! Sorry, Niles.

427
00:21:02,767 --> 00:21:03,802
[MOUTHS]
<i>That's funny.</i>

428
00:21:03,967 --> 00:21:06,162
- Would you like some sherry?
- Yes, thanks.

429
00:21:06,327 --> 00:21:07,806
FRASIER: Daphne?
- Yeah, all right,

430
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:10,356
I'll get your precious wedge of brie
and your water crackers.

431
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:13,360
No. I meant,
would you like some sherry?

432
00:21:13,567 --> 00:21:14,761
Oh.

433
00:21:14,927 --> 00:21:16,280
Love some. Thanks.

434
00:21:17,847 --> 00:21:19,724
Listen, Daphne,
I know this is all very awkward,

435
00:21:19,887 --> 00:21:21,798
but if it speeds up
the divorce process,

436
00:21:21,967 --> 00:21:24,435
avoids the misery I went through
with Maris, isn't it worth it?

437
00:21:24,607 --> 00:21:25,722
Well...

438
00:21:25,927 --> 00:21:28,361
Come on, snookums, we can
get through this. What do you say?

439
00:21:28,567 --> 00:21:30,842
What did you just call me?

440
00:21:31,967 --> 00:21:33,605
- Snookums.
- Snookums?

441
00:21:33,767 --> 00:21:35,803
It was an attempt at a pet name.

442
00:21:36,007 --> 00:21:38,965
Well, if it's all the same to you,
could we keep looking?

443
00:21:39,607 --> 00:21:43,236
Absolutely.
There's no rush whatsoever, truffles.

444
00:21:45,047 --> 00:21:47,242
It's the chocolate, not the fungus.

445
00:21:48,887 --> 00:21:50,400
- It's a work in progress.
- Yes.

446
00:21:50,567 --> 00:21:52,125
FRASIER: Here you are.
- Thank you.

447
00:21:52,287 --> 00:21:54,323
- Well, for you.
- Thank you.

448
00:21:54,487 --> 00:21:56,443
Here is to better days.

449
00:21:57,287 --> 00:21:59,960
For all of us. Ha-ha-ha-ho.

450
00:22:00,887 --> 00:22:02,036
Why, what happened to you?

451
00:22:02,207 --> 00:22:04,641
Well, I went down
and talked to Donny,

452
00:22:04,807 --> 00:22:07,446
try to convince him to drop
his lawsuit against you.

453
00:22:07,607 --> 00:22:09,802
Instead, he's now suing me
as well for the part I played

454
00:22:09,967 --> 00:22:11,082
in getting you two together.

455
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:12,965
DAPHNE:
Well, I am so sorry, Dr. Crane.

456
00:22:13,167 --> 00:22:15,397
This is turning
into such a horrible mess.

457
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:18,206
Not that I expected it to be
a bed of roses, mind you,

458
00:22:18,367 --> 00:22:20,437
but it's gotten so you wonder
what God-awful calamity

459
00:22:20,607 --> 00:22:22,120
is gonna befall us next.

460
00:22:26,487 --> 00:22:29,877
Something smells in your elevator.

461
00:22:30,847 --> 00:22:34,476
Ohh. Now it smells in here too.

462
00:22:34,927 --> 00:22:38,761
I'm beginning to think this is not such
a ritzy building after all.

463
00:22:40,847 --> 00:22:42,724
Did you get my wedding gifts

00:37:55,207 --> 00:38:00,076
we will adjourn to the Winnebago
where Mr. Jean-Claude Van Damme,

770
00:38:00,247 --> 00:38:05,844
the Muscles from Brussels<i>,</i> will ply
his trade against the forces of evil.

771
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:08,244
- Ready at 8?
- Make it 7:30.

772
00:38:11,287 --> 00:38:12,561
NILES:
Good idea, Dad.

773
00:38:12,727 --> 00:38:14,638
An evening out, just the two of us.

774
00:38:14,807 --> 00:38:16,877
I had no idea you enjoyed
the Natural History Museum.

775
00:38:17,047 --> 00:38:19,925
Oh, sure, and that documentary on
the rain forest is supposed to be great.

776
00:38:20,087 --> 00:38:21,281
That's what I hear.

777
00:38:21,487 --> 00:38:24,240
Hope it has Pygmies. I like Pygmies.

778
00:38:25,047 --> 00:38:26,844
I know you do.

779
00:38:27,047 --> 00:38:28,639
So, uh, where's...?

780
00:38:28,847 --> 00:38:30,917
She went out with Frasier
to a restaurant for dinner.

781
00:38:31,407 --> 00:38:32,886
Ah.

782
00:38:33,047 --> 00:38:35,720
- Did she happen to ask about...?
- Sorry.

783
00:38:42,367 --> 00:38:43,402
Dad, we're going up.

784
00:38:43,567 --> 00:38:45,717
Oh, God. Oh, I'm sorry.

785
00:38:45,927 --> 00:38:48,395
Well, we'll just have to take
the long way.

786
00:38:50,567 --> 00:38:52,797
Why do you like Pygmies so much?

787
00:38:54,847 --> 00:38:57,839
They're short and they blow darts.
What's not to like?

788
00:39:00,767 --> 00:39:02,041
Come on. Come on up here.

789
00:39:02,207 --> 00:39:04,767
NILES: What could possibly be
so important for me to see up here?

790
00:39:04,927 --> 00:39:06,838
The guy in 1708
got some homing pigeons.

791
00:39:07,007 --> 00:39:08,326
He built a coop up here for them.

792
00:39:08,487 --> 00:39:12,685
Pigeons? I don't like pigeons.
They have no respect for public art.

793
00:39:13,527 --> 00:39:15,245
Trust me. You're gonna like this.

794
00:39:15,407 --> 00:39:17,682
Dad, I don't think I handled things
very well today.

795
00:39:17,847 --> 00:39:20,520
Do you think Daphne
will ever forgive me?

796
00:39:20,807 --> 00:39:23,082
Why don't you ask her for yourself?

797
00:39:31,167 --> 00:39:33,283
Your table is ready, sir.

798
00:39:36,127 --> 00:39:38,687
- You look stunning.
- Thank you.

799
00:39:38,847 --> 00:39:40,883
You look dashing.

800
00:39:41,207 --> 00:39:43,675
FRASIER:
I trust this will be to your liking.

801
00:39:43,847 --> 00:39:46,202
Everything's to my liking.

802
00:39:46,407 --> 00:39:48,875
Looks like we're having
that first date after all.

803
00:39:49,087 --> 00:39:50,964
You went to so much trouble.

804
00:39:51,167 --> 00:39:53,237
It wasn't me. It was your brother.

805
00:39:53,447 --> 00:39:56,439
Well, you know me. I hate to butt in.

806
00:39:56,607 --> 00:39:57,926
NILES:
Ohh...

807
00:39:59,127 --> 00:40:03,803
I'd planned to take Daphne to dinner
when suddenly inspiration struck.

808
00:40:03,967 --> 00:40:06,435
Since you two couldn't go
to Au Pied de Cochon this evening,

809
00:40:06,607 --> 00:40:10,077
my faithful companion and I

810
00:40:10,287 --> 00:40:12,323
would bring it to you courtesy
of their caterer.

811
00:40:12,527 --> 00:40:15,325
If dancing at the Starlight Room
was impossible,

812
00:40:15,487 --> 00:40:17,159
we'd give you the real thing.

813
00:40:19,727 --> 00:40:21,365
It's all so overwhelming.

814
00:40:21,567 --> 00:40:23,762
Yeah. Frasier, Dad,
I don't know what to say.

815
00:40:23,967 --> 00:40:26,401
You even got that man
to move his pigeons.

816
00:40:28,087 --> 00:40:29,566
There were no pigeons.

817
00:40:29,887 --> 00:40:31,366
Ohh.

818
00:40:32,047 --> 00:40:33,321
How can we ever thank you two?

819
00:40:33,487 --> 00:40:35,045
Just have a beautiful evening.

820
00:40:35,207 --> 00:40:36,765
I think we can do that.

821
00:40:36,967 --> 00:40:40,118
- And, Frasier, listen...
- Apology accepted, Niles.

822
00:40:40,807 --> 00:40:43,275
Oh, just remember to give
the lingonberry sauce a little stir...

823
00:40:43,487 --> 00:40:45,364
MARTIN:
They can figure it out.

824
00:40:46,007 --> 00:40:47,520
Right.

825
00:40:52,647 --> 00:40:55,639
- Daphne, about today...
- Let's just forget about that.

826
00:40:55,807 --> 00:40:57,160
Why don't we start from here?

827
00:40:57,367 --> 00:40:59,358
I would love that.

828
00:41:00,167 --> 00:41:02,761
- To us.
- To us.

829
00:41:15,767 --> 00:41:18,281
I'm usually so nervous
on a first date,

830
00:41:18,447 --> 00:41:20,358
but not tonight.

831
00:41:21,607 --> 00:41:22,926
Would you like to dance?

832
00:41:23,127 --> 00:41:24,560
Oh, I'd love to.

833
00:41:36,087 --> 00:41:37,645
So where are you from?

834
00:41:37,807 --> 00:41:40,480
- Manchester, England.
- Oh, my.

835
00:41:40,647 --> 00:41:42,717
- Big family?
- Hideously.

836
00:41:42,887 --> 00:41:44,206
[NILES CHUCKLES]

837
00:41:44,367 --> 00:41:45,402
DAPHNE:
And you?

838
00:41:45,567 --> 00:41:47,603
I'm from a small mountain village
in Tibet.

839
00:41:47,767 --> 00:41:48,961
[DAPHNE CHUCKLING]

840
00:41:49,127 --> 00:41:52,005
Tenzing Norgay used
to carry me to school.

841
00:41:52,167 --> 00:41:54,601
You know what
I've always wondered?

842
00:41:54,767 --> 00:41:56,997
- Think I can guess?
- Yeah.
