ROZ: Frasier, I knew
when you bought me lunch,

2
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,800
there was going to be a catch.

3
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:15,000
- How long is this gonna take?
- Well, it shouldn't take too long, Roz.

4
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,900
I can't believe I'm actually scouring
a science-fiction convention

5
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:19,300
for <i>X- Men</i> comics.

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,600
I feel I'm contributing
to the decline of my son's intellect.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,200
Then why are you doing it?

8
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,300
Well, because I said no
to the eyebrow ring.

9
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,500
Oh, excuse me, good sir.

10
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,500
Could you direct me, please,
to Cubby's World of Comics?

11
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,700
- Yeah, it's right over there.
- Oh.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,300
Thank you. Thank you very much.
You're a fierce but helpful people.

13
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,300
Oh, stop.

14
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,900
- Good Lord. That's Jackson Hedley.
- Who?

15
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,200
FRASIER: Jackson Hedley,
the famous Shakespearean actor.

16
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,000
He came to my school
when I was a teen,

17
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,800
did a show of soliloquies,
began my love affair with the Bard.

18
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,500
Excuse me, Roz, I think I'll just go
pay my respects to Mr. Hedley.

19
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:07,300
Excuse me. Um, what's
Jackson Hedley doing here?

20
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,600
Signing autographs
and being awesome.

21
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:16,000
They've got the whole cast
of <i>Space Patrol</i> coming this weekend.

22
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,600
Jackson Hedley
was on a television show?

23
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,800
What, are you kidding?
He's Tobor, the ship's android.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,200
Where you been, man?

25
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,100
I don't know.

26
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:31,000
Reading, attending the theatre,
getting haircuts.

27
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,200
Hi, Roz.

28
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:39,900
Hi, Noel.

29
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,000
So you're a closet Trekker.

30
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:45,700
I always had a feeling
we were more than mere coworkers.

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,600
This explains the heat between us.

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,400
I feel heat, all right.
Because I'm in hell.

33
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,000
- There you are, Dwayne.
- Thanks, Tobor.

34
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,700
FRASIER:
Hello, Mr. Hedley.

35
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,100
May I say
it's an honour to see you again.

36
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,600
Thank you. So, what would you like
to be autographed today?

37
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,500
Actually, I already have
your autograph.

38
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:07,600
I got it after seeing
your performance of <i>Hamlet.</i>

39
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,100
Oh, my.

40
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,600
- That was a long time ago.
- But not forgotten.

41
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,900
May I say, on behalf
of my brother and myself,

42
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,300
thank you for opening our young eyes
to the wonders of Shakespeare.

43
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,400
You are more than welcome.

44
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:24,200
Tell me, do you get to do
much theatre anymore?

45
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,300
Oh, no, I'm afraid
those days are over.

46
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,100
The show became so popular,

47
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:32,400
I can't get cast as anything
but an android, a cyborg,

48
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:37,600
or when I get a chance
to really spread my wings, a mutant.

49
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:42,500
Well, what a shame.
For you and the theatre.

50
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,800
Oh, you are very kind.

51
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,500
Well, my fans await.
It was lovely meeting you, Mr...

52
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,100
Frasier Crane.

53
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,500
Thank you, Mr. Hedley.

54
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,600
It just breaks my heart
to see that man reduced to this.

55
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,700
So demeaning.

56
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,700
Well, so he's not
doing Shakespeare,

57
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
but look, he's got tons of fans
that worship him.

58
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,800
What's so demeaning about that?

59
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,500
Hey, Tobor, would you do
my kid's birthday party?

60
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,700
Here's my card.

61
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,700
Travel time is extra
and I eat by myself.

62
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,500
- Hey, look who I found at the airport.
- Oh.

63
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,800
Welcome home, Dad.
So how was Florida?

64
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,100
Oh, it was a whirlwind.

65
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,900
Duke and I hit the dog track,

66
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,900
and then we met the Michael Jordan
of jai alai players at the Red Lobster.

67
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:43,000
But the place I went back to most of all
was Captain Pete's Gator Farm.

68
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,600
Ah, ah. Did you go see
the Hemingway home?

69
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:49,000
Well, you know, Fras,
you can't squeeze everything in.

70
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,800
But I tell you,
these gators are amazing.

71
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,900
You're out in the glades
in this fan boat,

72
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:59,300
and it's just you and Captain Pete
and a cooler full of raw chickens.

73
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,600
To think I wasted
my last vacation in Vienna.

74
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,700
Then he dangles a chicken at the end
of a stick and before you know it,

75
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,600
a 15-foot monster
comes rushing out of the water.

76
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
And he's yelling:

77
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,300
"Hurry up and take the picture.
This son of a bitch is heavy!"

78
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,200
That's delightful, Dad.

79
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,100
- Where's Daphne?
- My honey bunny has the flu.

80
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,700
Aww, that's too bad.

81
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:26,100
Probably got it standing
in front of an open refrigerator.

82
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,700
Nice to have you back, Dad.

83
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,200
- Frasier.
- Oh, thank you, Niles.

84
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,800
- You will never guess what I found.
- Hm?

85
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:41,500
This is the autograph Jackson Hedley
gave me in junior high school.

86
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,800
Oh, Niles.

87
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:49,800
"Dear Coach Pellit, please excuse
Niles from gym for obvious reasons."

88
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,400
- The other side.
- I figured.

89
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:58,600
"To Niles, my kingdom
for more fans like you.

90
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,900
Jackson Hedley." Gosh.

91
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,700
That's lovely.

92
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,600
Of course, I'm still envious
that you got to see him again.

93
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,800
You wouldn't be
if you'd been at that convention.

94
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:12,000
To see the man who defined Hamlet

95
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:16,400
reduced to hawking T-shirts
and sci-fi gewgaws.

96
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,100
- It's a terrible waste of talent.
- Tragic.

97
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,600
No artist should have to endure that.

98
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,800
If only people could see him
the way we did.

99
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,800
Niles,

100
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,300
how difficult would it be
to mount Jackson's one-man show?

101
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:33,700
It's relatively simple.

102
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:37,800
That's true. There's minimal scenery,
no supporting ca...

103
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,300
- Wait a minute, are you suggesting...?
- Well, why not?

104
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,800
There's certainly no shortage
of theatres in this town.

105
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,100
We could do it on a Monday
when they're dark anyway.

106
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,700
We could revive the man's career.

107
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:52,500
What a gift it would be to return this
man to the stage where he belongs.

108
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:55,500
It would be like repaying him
for giving us the gift of Shakespeare.

109
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,500
And if the evening goes very well,
who knows?

110
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,200
We could be in for a long run.
We might take it on the road.

111
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,600
Why not a television special?
A much larger audience.

112
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,800
It could become a cottage industry:

113
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,600
T-shirts, posters,
personal appearances.

114
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,900
Thank God we've come along
to save this man.

Tonight I can really cut loose.

00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:11,900
Those seats in the very back row
will be rattling.

That is good news.

These are the producers.

Do you guys have any idea
how many people you got out there?

319
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,000
You're way over capacity.

You're not going to shut us down,
are you?

Frasier, I knew we shouldn't have
added all those dry wooden seats.

Well, maybe next time
you'll know better.

I'm afraid we have some bad news.

Hey, you're Tobor.

Correct.

327
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,800
I used to watch your show
all the time.

328
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,800
I even have that old <i>Playboy</i> when
Space Princess Alexa did that spread.

Yes, I've got that one too.

he was the one performing tonight.

I'll let you guys stay open
on one condition:

I get to watch the show.

- It's okay. I'll sit in the aisle.

334
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,800
- Three minutes to curtain.
- Ah, here's the right one.

335
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,500
Well, we may as well
just take our lumps.

336
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:33,100
No, no, we're not
going to take any lumps.

I think I've broken something.

- Make sure Mr. Hedley's comfortable.
- Yes.

Dear God, Niles, I feel horrible.

It's as if we wished it
and it happened.

Half of me feels guilty.
The other half feels relieved.

Actually, it's more 30-70.

356
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,800
Well, I guess I'd better go out
and make an announcement.

had hoped to bring a great talent
back to the stage.
