I've just finished
my third basket of bread,

Oh.

You've torn your trouser cuff.
I'm so sorry.

Niles is running a little late,

how did you two kids meet?

Roz was standing right there
on the dock.

Right there on the dock, you say?
Well, hmm...

- Do you know anything about boats?

31

Well, actually, on my show, I
sometimes compare the human psyche

32
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:44,845
to a sailboat that's borne along
the surface of the conscious mind

33
00:01:45,047 --> 00:01:49,359
while the deeper waters of
the subconscious navigate the rudder.

- Yes.

Ah, Harvard. Mm, God,
those were the best years of my life.

and never having any of my own.

51

and I sailed around the world.

Yeah, sometimes there's
more adventure than I bargained for.

off the Hebrides
