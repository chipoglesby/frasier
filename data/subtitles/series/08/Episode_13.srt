for your inaugural ode.

And may I congratulate you
on your ingenuity

And now,
as outgoing corkmaster,

00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:24,521
it is my privilege
to bestow the sash of office

307
00:16:25,367 --> 00:16:27,244
He would hear none of it.

308
00:16:27,407 --> 00:16:30,956
All he did was keep quoting rules
and by-laws.

309
00:16:31,167 --> 00:16:33,522
Just like when you were kids
with that fort.

310
00:16:33,687 --> 00:16:36,201
You were always making up
these big fancy rules

311
00:16:36,367 --> 00:16:39,279
and titles for yourself.
It always ended up in a fight.

312
00:16:39,447 --> 00:16:41,517
I didn't like it then,
and I don't like it now.

313
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:43,843
All right, then,
we just won't talk about it.

314
00:16:44,007 --> 00:16:46,043
Besides,
I'm through with the wine club.

315
00:16:46,247 --> 00:16:48,363
Good. Why don't we
just enjoy our Wednesday?

316
00:16:48,567 --> 00:16:50,319
Second.

317
00:16:50,847 --> 00:16:52,838
All in favour?

318
00:16:53,447 --> 00:16:54,641
Aye.

319
00:16:54,807 --> 00:16:56,843
Motion carried.

320
00:17:01,007 --> 00:17:02,963
I'm done now.

321
00:17:04,887 --> 00:17:07,003
NILES:
Mm. Mm-hm, mm-hm.

322
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:09,563
I'm getting oak
with plummy overtones.

323
00:17:09,727 --> 00:17:12,446
I'm getting screwed on alimony.

324
00:17:14,567 --> 00:17:16,364
Niles, I wanna talk to you.

325
00:17:16,527 --> 00:17:18,563
Dad? What happened?
Is there something wrong?

326
00:17:18,727 --> 00:17:21,639
You're damned right there is.
It's about you and Frasier.

327
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:24,879
Good God, you wear a sash?

328
00:17:26,807 --> 00:17:28,240
Frasier sent you down here,
didn't he?

329
00:17:28,407 --> 00:17:32,082
FRASIER: No.
- Frasier, get in here, now.

330
00:17:34,527 --> 00:17:35,642
Dad, this isn't necessary.

331
00:17:35,807 --> 00:17:37,718
Yeah, we can talk about this
some other time.

332
00:17:37,887 --> 00:17:39,286
Zip it up, both of you.

333
00:17:39,487 --> 00:17:43,116
I just gave up the best meal of my life
to come down here, so listen up.

334
00:17:43,327 --> 00:17:46,364
Niles, let your brother play.

335
00:17:48,887 --> 00:17:49,922
Dad, this is not a game.

336
00:17:50,087 --> 00:17:51,805
This is a club,
and Frasier broke the rules.

337
00:17:51,967 --> 00:17:53,195
- Technically, I did...
- Zip!

338
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:55,967
Well, then you write a new rule
so that Frasier can come back.

339
00:17:56,167 --> 00:17:57,885
- First, I want an apology.
- I said zip it.

340
00:17:58,047 --> 00:18:00,038
- He did. I heard him.
- Don't get smart.

341
00:18:00,487 --> 00:18:02,478
Now, are you gonna
let your brother play?

342
00:18:02,687 --> 00:18:05,042
- Dad, l... Why...?
- Are you gonna let your brother play?

343
00:18:05,207 --> 00:18:07,675
Are you gonna
let your brother play?

344
00:18:09,247 --> 00:18:10,236
Fine.

345
00:18:10,407 --> 00:18:12,967
Am I gonna have any more trouble
between you two?

346
00:18:13,847 --> 00:18:15,883
- No.
- No.

347
00:18:16,767 --> 00:18:17,995
No what?

348
00:18:18,367 --> 00:18:19,356
- No, sir.
- No, sir.

349
00:18:19,527 --> 00:18:22,246
Good. Now, shake hands.

350
00:18:23,647 --> 00:18:24,796
That's more like it.

351
00:18:24,967 --> 00:18:27,322
Now, you don't mind, I've got
a big plate of <i>Gewürzplätzchen</i>

352
00:18:27,487 --> 00:18:29,603
waiting for me at home
with my name on it.

353
00:18:33,367 --> 00:18:37,076
Ahem. Well, let's get back
to the wine, shall we?

354
00:18:37,287 --> 00:18:39,926
You got yelled at by your dad.

[LAUGHING]

356
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:46,080
- Well, be that as it may...
- Zip it.

357
00:18:54,327 --> 00:18:55,646
- Niles.
- Hello, Frasier.

358
00:18:55,807 --> 00:18:58,640
Thought we could drive over
to Wine Club together.

359
00:18:58,807 --> 00:19:00,877
Actually,
I'm thinking about not going.

360
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:02,362
Why not?

361
00:19:02,567 --> 00:19:08,119
Niles, truth be told, my enthusiasm
for the wine club has started to turn.

362
00:19:08,327 --> 00:19:09,476
I know what you mean.

363
00:19:09,647 --> 00:19:13,481
It used to be the wine club,
now it's just the teasing-people club.

364
00:19:13,687 --> 00:19:14,961
Then let's not go.

365
00:19:15,167 --> 00:19:16,919
They'll put our names
in the absent bottle.

366
00:19:17,087 --> 00:19:19,442
We'll have to bring
the crackers next time.

367
00:19:19,887 --> 00:19:22,845
- What if there's no next time?
- What do you mean?

368
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:26,204
Niles, those people
don't care about wine.

369
00:19:26,407 --> 00:19:27,522
Not the way you and I do, no.

370
00:19:27,687 --> 00:19:30,247
What's preventing us from starting
a whole new club from scratch?

371
00:19:30,407 --> 00:19:33,365
- We could really get back to basics.
- Something that's just about wine,

372
00:19:33,527 --> 00:19:36,041
and a clear constitutional procedure
for enjoying it.

373
00:19:36,207 --> 00:19:38,926
Yes, well, then maybe this time
the governing body could be bicameral.

374
00:19:39,087 --> 00:19:40,122
Well, I don't know, Niles.

375
00:19:40,287 --> 00:19:42,596
There is something to be said
for the parliamentary system.

376
00:19:42,767 --> 00:19:46,203
Well, either way, we have to have
a strong judiciary to keep it in check.

377
00:19:46,367 --> 00:19:48,676
God, I love wine.
