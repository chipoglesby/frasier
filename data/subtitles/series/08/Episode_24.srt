00:06:43,927 --> 00:06:45,804
So, Abby, did you happen to get

155
00:06:45,967 --> 00:06:48,925
- any interesting e-mails today?
- Yes, I did,

156
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:52,204
but none that I feel comfortable
discussing in front of your father.

157
00:06:52,367 --> 00:06:56,042
Hey, Abby, you'll like this one.
We used to tell it in the precinct.

158
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:58,562
How many lawyers does it take
to screw in a light bulb?

159
00:06:58,727 --> 00:07:01,560
I don't know. Depends on
how many cops planted it there.

160
00:07:04,687 --> 00:07:06,962
Thrust and parry, Dad.

161
00:07:07,967 --> 00:07:09,116
[PHONE RINGS]

162
00:07:09,607 --> 00:07:11,359
Excuse me.

163
00:07:12,047 --> 00:07:15,926
Abby Michaels. Hold on.
It's a client.

164
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:19,681
Starting the meter, huh?

165
00:07:20,247 --> 00:07:22,761
I've already filed that motion.
It's up to them now.

166
00:07:22,927 --> 00:07:25,122
No, no.
I don't think that they would try that.

167
00:07:25,287 --> 00:07:26,686
But if you like, I could call them.

168
00:07:26,847 --> 00:07:29,566
Or better yet, I'll send them a letter
just so we're on the record.

169
00:07:29,727 --> 00:07:31,763
Okay. Bye now.

170
00:07:31,927 --> 00:07:34,361
Sorry. Where were we?

171
00:07:34,527 --> 00:07:36,961
- Aren't you forgetting something?
- Goodness, you're right.

172
00:07:37,127 --> 00:07:40,085
It's getting very late and
I haven't even looked at the menu yet.

173
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:43,563
Nice choices.
What are you guys having?

174
00:07:43,767 --> 00:07:48,283
Well, I'm pretty sure
someone's getting scrod.

175
00:07:51,007 --> 00:07:52,201
So how were the lobsters?

176
00:07:52,367 --> 00:07:55,439
They were too cute to eat.
I'm having the veal.

177
00:07:55,927 --> 00:07:59,681
Well, I propose a toast.
To frivolous lawsuits

178
00:07:59,847 --> 00:08:02,486
and the wonderful, charming clients
they bring together.

179
00:08:02,647 --> 00:08:04,160
Oh, well, hear, hear.

180
00:08:04,367 --> 00:08:08,918
Abby, I'm sorry to spoil the mood.
It's just that your client...

181
00:08:09,087 --> 00:08:12,716
Oh, right.
Thanks for reminding me.

182
00:08:12,887 --> 00:08:15,481
Oh, I don't believe it.
Donny just walked in.

183
00:08:15,967 --> 00:08:18,879
- I said, don't look.
- You did not.

184
00:08:19,087 --> 00:08:21,760
Can you imagine anything more
embarrassing than seeing us here?

185
00:08:21,967 --> 00:08:25,164
- Your menu's on fire.
- Well, that would be embarrassing...

186
00:08:25,327 --> 00:08:27,841
- Put it out! Put it out!
- No, not with the Dom Pérignon!

187
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,599
NILES: Careful, careful.
FRASIER: Watch it.

188
00:08:29,767 --> 00:08:30,802
- Oh, heavens.
- Oh, there.

189
00:08:30,967 --> 00:08:34,357
FRASIER:
Well, thank God. All right, well...

190
00:08:35,527 --> 00:08:38,360
Hi, guys. Hi.

191
00:08:40,167 --> 00:08:42,203
- Hi, Donny.
- Oh, hey.

192
00:08:42,367 --> 00:08:44,358
- Daphne.
- Hello, Donny.

193
00:08:44,527 --> 00:08:46,722
- Niles.
- Hello, Donny.

194
00:08:46,927 --> 00:08:48,440
I realise you guys
must be celebrating,

195
00:08:48,607 --> 00:08:50,996
but do you have to start a bonfire?

196
00:08:51,207 --> 00:08:54,040
- Oh, we're not celebrating.
- He thinks we're celebrating.

197
00:08:54,207 --> 00:08:56,846
I know this is a little awkward,
but I understand, don't worry.

198
00:08:57,007 --> 00:09:00,204
In fact,
I'm celebrating something myself.

199
00:09:00,407 --> 00:09:03,205
- Did you win a big case, Donny?
- No.

200
00:09:03,367 --> 00:09:05,722
I got engaged.

201
00:09:05,927 --> 00:09:10,364
Really? Well, boy, that's good news.

202
00:09:10,527 --> 00:09:12,199
Yes. Yes, it certainly is.

203
00:09:12,367 --> 00:09:15,245
Thank you.
In fact, she's sitting right over there.

204
00:09:15,407 --> 00:09:17,602
Wave, Nancy, wave.
Show them the rock, honey.

205
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:19,559
FRASIER: Oh, very nice.
MARTIN: It's lovely.

206
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:20,802
It's a big one.

207
00:09:21,007 --> 00:09:22,520
- Congratulations, Donny.
DONNY: Thank you.

208
00:09:22,727 --> 00:09:24,797
I was representing her in her divorce,
and we realised

209
00:09:24,967 --> 00:09:27,197
that we were perfect for each other.

210
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:30,564
And you know, I know it's very sudden,
but that's fate for you.

211
00:09:31,327 --> 00:09:33,238
Yes, well, good luck to you both.

212
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:35,756
Thank you, thank you.
I should get back to my sweetie.

213
00:09:35,927 --> 00:09:37,326
You guys should enjoy your dinner.

214
00:09:37,487 --> 00:09:41,196
Incidentally, the fire exits
are located there and there.

215
00:09:41,367 --> 00:09:44,120
- Good one.
- It's sort of funny.

216
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:48,725
Boy, that was weird.

217
00:09:49,207 --> 00:09:50,845
Now we know
why he dropped the lawsuit.

218
00:09:51,047 --> 00:09:53,515
- Yes, he's in love.
- Or on the rebound.

219
00:09:54,007 --> 00:09:55,884
Well, either way,
it's good news for all of you.

220
00:09:56,047 --> 00:09:57,639
Let's order
another bottle of champagne.

221
00:09:57,807 --> 00:10:00,321
And by the way, dinner is on me.
Or rather, the firm.

222
00:10:00,487 --> 00:10:02,842
Oh, no, no,
I couldn't let you do that, Abby.

223
00:10:03,007 --> 00:10:04,645
I wanted to pay for dinner.

224
00:10:04,847 --> 00:10:07,042
Don't worry. You are.

225
00:10:15,607 --> 00:10:17,643
NILES: Oh, Frasier,
I was just coming up to see you.

226
00:10:17,807 --> 00:10:19,160
FRASIER:
Oh, hi, Niles.

227
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:21,443
Say, you're looking
a little green around the gills.

228
00:10:21,607 --> 00:10:23,359
Oh, please, don't even mention gills.

229
00:10:23,567 --> 00:10:26,400
The Yale Club had its annual lunch
at Vashon Island. All seafood.

230
00:10:26,567 --> 00:10:28,797
- Oh, didn't agree with you?
- Oh, no, the food was fine.

231
00:10:28,967 --> 00:10:31,959
It was the 4-foot swells coming back
on the ferry that didn't agree with me.

232
00:10:32,127 --> 00:10:35,324
I'm afraid I was forced to return
my sea bass to the sea.

233
00:10:35,727 --> 00:10:37,399
Actually,
I had sort of a rough day myself.

234
00:10:37,567 --> 00:10:41,401
You know, I can't stop thinking
about the bill that Abby sent me.

235
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:43,245
- Oh?
- Well, you know, after witnessing

236
00:10:43,407 --> 00:10:46,319
her rather slipshod
recordkeeping last night,

237
00:10:46,487 --> 00:10:48,796
I can't help feeling
that I'm getting ripped off.

238
00:10:49,007 --> 00:10:51,885
So I fired off
a strongly worded e-mail today

239
00:10:52,047 --> 00:10:54,197
insisting on a point-by-point
accounting of my bill.

240
00:10:54,367 --> 00:10:55,356
Oh, good idea.

241
00:10:55,567 --> 00:10:58,877
Nothing cements a relationship
like calling the girl a crook.

242
00:10:59,087 --> 00:11:03,080
Speaking of relationships, how about
Donny's decision to get engaged?

243
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:05,755
My God, talk about
classic rebound behaviour.

244
00:11:05,927 --> 00:11:07,326
Classic.

245
00:11:07,527 --> 00:11:09,245
Is it just me
or is this elevator swaying?

246
00:11:09,407 --> 00:11:12,558
Probably not the wisest decision
Donny could have made at this point.

247
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:15,679
You know, maybe somebody
should have a talk with him.

248
00:11:15,887 --> 00:11:17,639
Stop. Don't even think about it.

249
00:11:17,807 --> 00:11:21,720
Right now the only thing Donny needs
is to be left alone.

250
00:11:23,287 --> 00:11:25,562
- Oh, hi, Daph.
- Hello.

251
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:28,878
- Where are you off to?
- I've got to see Donny.

252
00:11:29,887 --> 00:11:31,605
Why in the world
do you have to see Donny?

253
00:11:31,807 --> 00:11:34,401
I'm worried about him.
He's making such a rash decision.

254
00:11:34,927 --> 00:11:39,000
I just wanna make sure he's okay.
And it's not just about that.

255
00:11:39,207 --> 00:11:40,799
We never really had
a proper goodbye

256
00:11:40,967 --> 00:11:43,435
and I feel bad leaving things
the way we did.

257
00:11:43,647 --> 00:11:45,717
What you're looking for is...

258
00:11:49,647 --> 00:11:51,205
Closure.

259
00:11:51,407 --> 00:11:54,205
Yeah. I knew you'd understand.

260
00:11:54,367 --> 00:11:57,677
- Niles, are you feeling okay?
- Oh, yes, I'll be fine.

261
00:11:57,887 --> 00:12:00,481
Well, in that case, when I get back,
this will all be behind us.

262
00:12:00,647 --> 00:12:01,716
We can celebrate.

263
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:04,355
I'll make us
a nice big English country dinner.

264
00:12:04,527 --> 00:12:06,802
Steak and kidney pudding.

265
00:12:07,367 --> 00:12:08,686
ROZ:
Hold the elevator. Hey, Daphne.

266
00:12:08,847 --> 00:12:11,236
- Niles, I need your opinion.
- Oh, really, I was just about...

267
00:12:11,407 --> 00:12:13,637
About some more classical music
to tape for Alice.

268
00:12:13,807 --> 00:12:16,401
- What?
- Yeah. Oh. I, uh...

269
00:12:16,567 --> 00:12:18,956
Frasier gave me this list,
but it has over 300 names on it.

270
00:12:19,127 --> 00:12:20,116
Who do you think is best?

271
00:12:20,287 --> 00:12:21,879
I would really rather not read
right now.

272
00:12:22,047 --> 00:12:25,278
Okay, well, off the top of your head.
Alice really loves up-tempo numbers.

273
00:12:25,447 --> 00:12:27,165
Last night we were listening
to "Peer Gynt"

274
00:12:27,327 --> 00:12:29,522
and she started doing all these
little ballerina moves.

275
00:12:29,727 --> 00:12:31,319
You should have seen her,
she was so cute.

276
00:12:31,487 --> 00:12:35,002
She would sway back and forth
to the music

277
00:12:35,207 --> 00:12:37,084
and do these little spins, a jump.

278
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:39,397
I was doing it with her,
but I started to get so dizzy.

279
00:12:39,567 --> 00:12:43,560
The room went around
and around and around.

280
00:12:44,327 --> 00:12:46,397
- Oh, never mind. I'll ask Frasier.
FRASIER: Hi, Roz.

281
00:12:46,567 --> 00:12:48,125
Where are you going?
What about the CDs?

282
00:12:48,287 --> 00:12:50,801
I'm sorry. Take what you like
and mark it on the sign-out sheet.

283
00:12:51,007 --> 00:12:52,725
Niles, thank God you're here.
Come with me.

284
00:12:52,887 --> 00:12:54,639
There was a message on the machine
from Abby.

285
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:57,321
She said
she needed to see me right away.

286
00:12:57,927 --> 00:12:59,155
She must have gotten my e-mail.

287
00:12:59,327 --> 00:13:02,364
The message was so short that I can't
really tell what sort of mood she's in.

288
00:13:02,567 --> 00:13:05,365
I guess if she'd been really angry,
she would've left some indication.

289
00:13:05,567 --> 00:13:07,080
Well, then again,
being a savvy lawyer,

290
00:13:07,247 --> 00:13:08,919
she might not really wanna tip
her hand.

291
00:13:09,127 --> 00:13:12,244
Whatever happens, I feel confident
that I made the right decision.

292
00:13:12,407 --> 00:13:14,523
Oh, thanks, Niles,
you've been a support.

293
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:15,716
- Hi, Dad.
MARTIN: Hey.

294
00:13:15,887 --> 00:13:17,400
Oh, Niles, great news.

295
00:13:17,567 --> 00:13:19,558
Tony the chilli guy
got his vendor licence back.

296
00:13:19,727 --> 00:13:21,877
Check it out.

297
00:13:30,447 --> 00:13:33,041
- Oh, you have the rings?
- Right here.

298
00:13:33,207 --> 00:13:34,196
- Okay.
- Are you nervous?

299
00:13:34,367 --> 00:13:35,720
Well, yeah. I'm excited.

300
00:13:35,887 --> 00:13:39,163
I can't believe Nancy's finally gonna be
my wife after all these weeks.

301
00:13:40,287 --> 00:13:41,879
Okay.

302
00:13:44,127 --> 00:13:45,560
Daphne, what are you doing here?

303
00:13:45,767 --> 00:13:47,598
Your receptionist told me
you'd left for court.

304
00:13:47,767 --> 00:13:49,166
- This is not a good time.
- I know.

305
00:13:49,327 --> 00:13:51,522
You're probably in the middle
of a trial, I'll be brief.

306
00:13:51,687 --> 00:13:55,077
Donny, after seeing you
at the restaurant last night,

307
00:13:55,247 --> 00:13:56,999
I want you to know
I'm worried about you.

308
00:13:57,207 --> 00:13:59,846
- Okay. This is about Nancy?
- I'm sure she's a lovely person

309
00:14:00,007 --> 00:14:02,885
and I probably have no right
saying this,

310
00:14:03,047 --> 00:14:05,083
but I hope you're not
rushing into anything.

311
00:14:05,287 --> 00:14:07,198
- Look, Daphne...
- I know, I know.

312
00:14:07,367 --> 00:14:09,244
I'm way out of line here.

313
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:12,922
But I still care about
what happens to you.

314
00:14:13,127 --> 00:14:15,641
Take the time
to get to know each other.

315
00:14:15,847 --> 00:14:17,246
Believe me, you'll be glad you did

316
00:14:17,407 --> 00:14:19,477
when the day comes
you finally do get married.

317
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:22,719
- Yes. Hi.
- Well, what do you know, it's here.

318
00:14:23,607 --> 00:14:25,916
I'll meet you inside. I'll be one second.
I'm sorry. Okay?

319
00:14:26,087 --> 00:14:27,566
I'm so sorry.

320
00:14:27,767 --> 00:14:29,723
- My timing is so terrible.
- Not really.

321
00:14:29,927 --> 00:14:32,646
If you hang around a few minutes,
we can get you on the wedding video.

322
00:14:32,847 --> 00:14:35,236
I really had no idea
you were getting married so soon.

323
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:38,558
Well, call me crazy, but I've got
a prejudice against long engagements.

324
00:14:38,767 --> 00:14:41,884
- Mom, hi.
- Sweetie, you look so handsome.

325
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:44,117
It's you.

326
00:14:44,327 --> 00:14:46,477
- Hello, Mother Douglas.
- Mrs. Douglas.

327
00:14:46,687 --> 00:14:48,803
You have some nerve
showing up here.

328
00:14:49,007 --> 00:14:51,396
You can beg all you want,
but he's not coming back.

329
00:14:51,567 --> 00:14:53,683
- Mom, Mom.
- He's done crying over you.

330
00:14:53,847 --> 00:14:55,724
- Mom, she knows.
- I don't want you to go back.

331
00:14:55,887 --> 00:14:57,923
- Mom... No, I'm not.
- Don't you dare, don't do it.

332
00:14:58,087 --> 00:14:59,486
DONNY:
I'll see you in a minute.

333
00:15:00,687 --> 00:15:03,724
Look, Daphne, I don't mean
to rush you, but is there anything else?

334
00:15:03,887 --> 00:15:05,400
Just this.

335
00:15:05,607 --> 00:15:09,805
I never really said how sorry I was
about what happened.

336
00:15:09,967 --> 00:15:11,446
I really am.

337
00:15:12,847 --> 00:15:15,839
Well, Daphne,
if it puts your mind at ease,

338
00:15:16,007 --> 00:15:20,364
I know what I'm doing. I'm happy.
I'm ready to go on with my life.

339
00:15:21,207 --> 00:15:22,242
So...

340
00:15:23,007 --> 00:15:26,556
Yeah, no, I'm... Hey. Goodbye.

341
00:15:26,727 --> 00:15:28,365
Donny.

342
00:15:32,047 --> 00:15:33,799
Congratulations.

343
00:15:35,207 --> 00:15:37,198
Thank you, Daphne.

344
00:15:46,287 --> 00:15:48,642
- Oh, there you are.
- Listen, I got your message.

345
00:15:48,807 --> 00:15:51,685
It sounded kind of urgent,
so I came right down.

346
00:15:52,127 --> 00:15:53,480
I suppose you read my e-mail.

347
00:15:53,647 --> 00:15:55,558
No, actually,
my computer's been down all day.

348
00:15:56,247 --> 00:15:58,044
But if it's anything like the last one,
well,

349
00:15:58,247 --> 00:16:01,159
then, I guess we'll know
what overheated my hard drive.

350
00:16:01,367 --> 00:16:03,437
MAN: Lt'll need a few minutes
to reconnect to the server

351
00:16:03,647 --> 00:16:06,366
- and then it will be up and running.
- Thank you.

352
00:16:06,887 --> 00:16:08,400
Yeah.

353
00:16:10,327 --> 00:16:13,922
So, uh, why did you call me?

354
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:16,756
Well, Frasier,

355
00:16:18,607 --> 00:16:20,245
I thought we could celebrate.

356
00:16:20,447 --> 00:16:22,756
Really? Celebrate what?

357
00:16:23,367 --> 00:16:25,722
Well, this morning, I was called down
to the conference room

358
00:16:25,887 --> 00:16:27,161
and all the partners were there.

359
00:16:27,327 --> 00:16:29,716
I thought they were going to yell at me
because they found out

360
00:16:29,887 --> 00:16:31,923
I had given you a discount.

361
00:16:32,087 --> 00:16:36,603
But instead,
they told me I made partner.

362
00:16:36,807 --> 00:16:38,763
You gave me a discount?

363
00:16:38,967 --> 00:16:42,118
- I mean, congratulations. Well, gosh.
- Thank you.

364
00:16:42,287 --> 00:16:44,437
Oh, my God,
you certainly deserve it.

365
00:16:46,167 --> 00:16:48,283
What kind of discount?

366
00:16:48,447 --> 00:16:51,519
- You didn't even notice, did you?
- No, no, I did notice. I did.

367
00:16:51,727 --> 00:16:54,844
I swear to God I noticed.
I even pointed it out to Dad.

368
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:57,402
That's very sweet.

369
00:16:58,527 --> 00:17:00,518
You're the sweet one.

370
00:17:02,807 --> 00:17:06,766
I'm not always sweet.

371
00:17:08,447 --> 00:17:10,517
Oh, Abby.

372
00:17:12,247 --> 00:17:13,919
COMPUTERISED VOICE:
<i>You have e-mail.</i>

373
00:17:18,647 --> 00:17:21,400
I'm not reading them.
The office is closed.

374
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:25,395
That's a very good decision.
That is partner-level thinking.

375
00:17:26,207 --> 00:17:28,846
Wait. What am I thinking?

376
00:17:29,007 --> 00:17:31,965
You've sent me another one of those
naughty e-mails, haven't you?

377
00:17:32,127 --> 00:17:33,799
Maybe we should act this one out.

378
00:17:33,967 --> 00:17:35,639
No, no, actually, I just...

379
00:17:35,807 --> 00:17:37,923
I just forwarded you an ad
for reduced mortgage rates.

380
00:17:38,087 --> 00:17:43,207
- Then why are you blushing, Frasier?
- Because they're embarrassingly low.

381
00:17:44,007 --> 00:17:46,601
- This says, "Re: Our relationship."
- All right, you're on to me.

382
00:17:46,767 --> 00:17:51,443
Now, listen, come here
and sit down and relax.

383
00:17:51,607 --> 00:17:54,917
And I will read it to you.

384
00:17:55,807 --> 00:18:00,005
Prepare to be scandalised.

385
00:18:02,767 --> 00:18:04,120
"Dear Abby.

386
00:18:05,207 --> 00:18:07,516
I read your column every week."
I'm kidding.

387
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,241
Uh...

388
00:18:11,407 --> 00:18:14,285
No, okay, okay, this time this is
the real stuff now, all right. Um...

389
00:18:17,367 --> 00:18:21,280
"I'm lying here in bed

390
00:18:21,447 --> 00:18:26,441
and I can't stop thinking about you."

391
00:18:26,607 --> 00:18:28,165
This is getting good.

392
00:18:28,367 --> 00:18:30,835
Oh, you like that, do you? All right.

393
00:18:33,407 --> 00:18:36,956
"Your golden hair cascades

394
00:18:37,127 --> 00:18:40,517
down your bare shoulders,

395
00:18:40,807 --> 00:18:43,640
and I kiss the curve
at the back of your neck."

396
00:18:44,487 --> 00:18:46,955
I'm very lonely over here.

397
00:18:47,127 --> 00:18:50,324
- Oh, gosh, I've deleted it by accident.
- Oh, no, that's too bad.

398
00:18:50,487 --> 00:18:52,876
I really wanted to hear
the rest of that.

399
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:59,046
Well, you know what?
We can write a new ending together.

400
00:18:59,447 --> 00:19:01,165
But there's no need to rush.

401
00:19:01,327 --> 00:19:04,524
Listen, we'll just start

402
00:19:04,687 --> 00:19:08,600
very slowly at the beginning.

403
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:15,565
And then we'll move gently
into the middle.

404
00:19:16,247 --> 00:19:22,004
And then I'm sure you'll want to add
a few plot twists of your own.

405
00:19:22,287 --> 00:19:24,517
Then finally we'll just...

406
00:19:25,047 --> 00:19:26,036
What are you reading?

407
00:19:26,567 --> 00:19:28,842
Your e-mail.
You printed it by mistake.

408
00:19:29,007 --> 00:19:31,157
You think I'm ripping you off?

409
00:19:31,327 --> 00:19:33,318
No. No, no,
I did not use those words.

410
00:19:33,527 --> 00:19:35,916
Actually, I just took issue
with a couple of figures.

411
00:19:36,127 --> 00:19:37,765
And you come in here
and lie to me?

412
00:19:37,967 --> 00:19:39,446
No, "lie" is a very strong word.

413
00:19:40,087 --> 00:19:43,159
Well, so is "chiseller."

414
00:19:43,367 --> 00:19:46,643
Listen, Abby,
I realise I've made a terrible mistake.

415
00:19:46,807 --> 00:19:49,275
And I wrote some very harsh things.

416
00:19:49,487 --> 00:19:51,682
But, to my credit,
I did attempt to delete it

417
00:19:51,847 --> 00:19:54,077
before you had a chance to read it.

418
00:19:54,887 --> 00:19:57,196
- Get out.
- Oh, come on.

419
00:19:57,367 --> 00:19:59,756
Look at the two of us.
We can't stay mad at each other.

420
00:19:59,967 --> 00:20:01,639
I said, get out.

421
00:20:04,767 --> 00:20:08,555
And to think
that I almost slept with you.

422
00:20:10,207 --> 00:20:12,516
FRASIER:
You still can.
