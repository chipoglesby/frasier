2
00:00:12,727 --> 00:00:14,922
- Hey, Daphne.
- Hello, Roz, Alice.

3
00:00:15,087 --> 00:00:17,476
- What brings you here?
- We're borrowing Frasier's car.

4
00:00:17,687 --> 00:00:20,247
Oh, I see. And you're leaving
Alice here as collateral.

5
00:00:20,447 --> 00:00:22,199
Actually,
he's being very nice about it.

6
00:00:22,367 --> 00:00:24,562
Mine's in the shop,
and I'm taking Alice and her friends

7
00:00:24,727 --> 00:00:25,796
to an ice cream party.

8
00:00:26,007 --> 00:00:28,601
You told me it was your friends
and the Science Centre.

9
00:00:28,767 --> 00:00:31,327
He said, she said,
we'll never know what really happened.

10
00:00:31,487 --> 00:00:35,196
Frasier, don't be so uptight.
I'm not gonna hurt your precious car.

11
00:00:35,367 --> 00:00:37,756
I am not uptight. I've just had
unfortunate experiences before

12
00:00:37,927 --> 00:00:39,121
loaning out my car.

13
00:00:39,287 --> 00:00:43,724
DAPHNE: I left an umbrella in the trunk.
- It was a wet umbrella.

14
00:00:44,287 --> 00:00:46,164
Can I have the keys?

15
00:00:47,087 --> 00:00:49,647
Yes, yes.

16
00:00:49,847 --> 00:00:53,522
After all, what are fine possessions for
if not to be used and enjoyed?

17
00:00:54,047 --> 00:00:55,765
And who better to enjoy them

18
00:00:55,967 --> 00:00:59,118
than the delightful souls
of small children?

19
00:00:59,327 --> 00:01:01,682
- I'll put a tarp in the back seat.
- Oh, bless you.

20
00:01:01,887 --> 00:01:03,320
- Hey, Roz. Hello, Alice.
ROZ: Hey.

21
00:01:03,487 --> 00:01:05,523
- What brings you here?
- Frasier loaned me his car.

22
00:01:05,687 --> 00:01:07,484
I backed mine into a telephone pole.

23
00:01:07,687 --> 00:01:10,520
- You said you were getting a tune-up.
- It needs one, trust me.

24
00:01:12,247 --> 00:01:14,203
- Is Daphne ready?
- Uh...

25
00:01:14,367 --> 00:01:16,562
Actually, I think she's in her room.
You two have plans?

26
00:01:16,727 --> 00:01:18,479
Yes, I am taking her
to the botanical gardens.

27
00:01:18,647 --> 00:01:20,797
Can you believe
she's never been before?

28
00:01:21,007 --> 00:01:23,601
Didn't Donny take her
to the botanical gardens last year?

29
00:01:23,807 --> 00:01:26,719
Can you believe
she's never been before?

30
00:01:29,007 --> 00:01:31,521
- Hey, Daphne.
- Hello, Niles.

31
00:01:31,687 --> 00:01:32,915
NILES:
Ready to go to the gardens?

32
00:01:33,087 --> 00:01:35,317
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to take Eddie
for a walk first.

33
00:01:35,487 --> 00:01:37,205
- Where's Dad?
- I don't know, he's gone.

34
00:01:37,367 --> 00:01:38,800
Here, I'll take him for a quick walk.

35
00:01:38,967 --> 00:01:41,800
DAPHNE: Oh, no, he's gonna need
more than that. He'll go stir crazy.

36
00:01:41,967 --> 00:01:43,878
He's gonna need a full run
at the dog park.

37
00:01:44,047 --> 00:01:45,639
We don't have time
to go to the dog park.

38
00:01:45,807 --> 00:01:48,367
The tour of succulents
starts promptly at 12.

39
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:50,523
- Hey Frasier, can you take him?
- No, I'm sorry.

40
00:01:50,687 --> 00:01:51,722
Roz has my car, you see,

41
00:01:51,887 --> 00:01:54,526
and Lana's coming to pick me up
for a tutoring session with Kirby.

42
00:01:54,687 --> 00:01:56,006
Oh, I'll just get Eddie's toys.

43
00:01:56,167 --> 00:01:57,441
Hello, this is Dr. Frasier Crane.

44
00:01:57,607 --> 00:01:59,677
I need to make
an emergency appointment tomorrow

45
00:01:59,847 --> 00:02:02,281
for a complete cleaning of my BMW.

46
00:02:02,887 --> 00:02:04,320
June 10th?

47
00:02:04,487 --> 00:02:07,604
But I have
a Clean Team Privileges Card.

48
00:02:07,767 --> 00:02:10,201
Yes, of course, it's a platinum one.

49
00:02:10,887 --> 00:02:12,366
No.

50
00:02:12,527 --> 00:02:15,200
No, there are no diamonds
on the corner.

51
00:02:15,727 --> 00:02:19,322
Well, yes, I'd like to become a member
of the Diamond Alliance immediately.

52
00:02:19,847 --> 00:02:21,166
Fine.

53
00:02:21,327 --> 00:02:25,639
Put me on the waiting list.
I'll see you in June.

54
00:02:28,047 --> 00:02:31,084
- You're not in the Diamond Alliance?
- Don't do that.

55
00:02:36,287 --> 00:02:37,800
- So this is it.
- Mm-hm.

56
00:02:37,967 --> 00:02:40,276
I'd hardly call this a dog park.

57
00:02:40,447 --> 00:02:44,565
It's more like a dog orgy.
Whose beagles are those?

58
00:02:44,727 --> 00:02:47,844
Don't stare. It only encourages them.

59
00:02:49,527 --> 00:02:50,596
All right, hurry up, Eddie.

60
00:02:50,767 --> 00:02:53,201
There's lots of exciting depravity
to explore.

61
00:02:53,887 --> 00:02:55,957
He wants to play a little fetch.

62
00:02:56,127 --> 00:02:58,687
- Oh, here, you throw it.
- With my bare hands?

63
00:02:58,847 --> 00:03:01,805
- Come on, it's fun.
- All right, ready?

64
00:03:01,967 --> 00:03:04,765
Here we go, and fetch.

65
00:03:06,927 --> 00:03:08,679
I didn't give you
enough of a challenge here.

66
00:03:08,847 --> 00:03:10,997
Come here. You ready? Ready?
And...

67
00:03:11,167 --> 00:03:12,725
Go get it.

68
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:15,685
I'm sorry. I was a bit of a grouch.

69
00:03:15,847 --> 00:03:18,566
This is actually a fine way
to spend the day.

70
00:03:18,727 --> 00:03:21,924
In fact, it's kind of...

71
00:03:24,847 --> 00:03:26,200
Hello.

72
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:29,396
Do you suppose the rest of Eddie's
in there?

73
00:03:30,007 --> 00:03:31,679
JIM:
Good boy, good boy.

74
00:03:31,847 --> 00:03:33,166
Sorry about that, Daphne,

75
00:03:33,367 --> 00:03:35,722
but with the organic vitamin paste
I've been feeding Tank,

76
00:03:35,887 --> 00:03:38,242
Eddie can't keep up with him
anymore.

77
00:03:38,687 --> 00:03:40,086
It's no problem, Jim.

78
00:03:40,247 --> 00:03:43,523
Niles, this is Jim Brady and Tank.
This is Niles, my boyfriend.

79
00:03:43,727 --> 00:03:46,116
- It's a pleasure.
- Boyfriend? I should have known.

80
00:03:46,287 --> 00:03:48,118
Every time I'm single,
you're in a relationship

81
00:03:48,287 --> 00:03:50,323
and every time you're single,
I'm in a relationship.

82
00:03:50,487 --> 00:03:51,636
Yeah, that's true.

83
00:03:51,807 --> 00:03:53,877
- I guess we just don't have good...
- Timing.

84
00:03:54,047 --> 00:03:55,560
Exactly.

85
00:03:55,767 --> 00:04:00,079
- And I'm a drummer.
- Which makes it even more ironic.

86
00:04:03,287 --> 00:04:06,438
Tank, that's rude. Now, chill.

87
00:04:08,327 --> 00:04:11,763
Wow, you've really got him trained.
That's the problem with Eddie.

88
00:04:11,927 --> 00:04:14,236
He only listens if he thinks
he's gonna get food.

89
00:04:14,407 --> 00:04:16,762
Or one of my socks.

90
00:04:18,207 --> 00:04:20,357
But mostly food.

91
00:04:20,767 --> 00:04:22,166
It's all in the voice tone, really.

92
00:04:22,327 --> 00:04:25,125
Any dog can learn to respond to it,
even an old wheezer like Eddie.

93
00:04:25,287 --> 00:04:27,164
- You want me to show you?
- I'd love it.

94
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:28,356
Come on. Come on, buddy.

95
00:04:28,527 --> 00:04:30,438
Yeah, we'd all love it.

96

[CELL PHONE RINGING]

97
00:04:31,927 --> 00:04:34,999
You guys go ahead.

98
00:04:35,527 --> 00:04:37,040
Yes.

99
00:04:37,207 --> 00:04:39,675
- Hello?
- Hi, Niles, it's me.

100
00:04:39,847 --> 00:04:41,997
I just want to make sure
Daphne took Eddie for a walk.

101
00:04:42,167 --> 00:04:44,078
I completely forgot about him
this morning.

102
00:04:44,287 --> 00:04:45,720
Yeah, yeah,
we're in the dog park now.

103
00:04:45,887 --> 00:04:49,004
- Where are you, anyway?
- I'm at the track.

104
00:04:49,167 --> 00:04:50,566
I had an itch for it when I woke up

105
00:04:50,727 --> 00:04:53,116
and so I just dropped everything
and went.

106
00:04:53,487 --> 00:04:55,239
I'm at the window.

107
00:04:55,647 --> 00:04:58,002
I'll have a trifecta in the eighth.

108
00:04:58,167 --> 00:04:59,156
Gotta run.

109
00:05:13,247 --> 00:05:15,920
Well, I didn't realise I was gonna be
selling houses with you today.

110
00:05:16,087 --> 00:05:18,157
Why didn't you drop me off
and then come on your own?

111
00:05:18,327 --> 00:05:21,125
Stop whining. It'll only take a minute.

112
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:23,721
I hope we don't run into the sad sack
who owns this place.

113
00:05:24,207 --> 00:05:26,038
I've been trying to sell this house
for a year,

114
00:05:26,207 --> 00:05:28,675
and he keeps driving away
every potential buyer.

115
00:05:28,887 --> 00:05:32,402
- How does he do that?
- Oh, hi.

116
00:05:33,927 --> 00:05:34,916
I heard a woman's voice.

117
00:05:35,087 --> 00:05:38,318
I thought it might be my wife
coming back to me.

118
00:05:38,767 --> 00:05:42,726
No. She lives in Portland now with
her new husband Lamar, remember?

119
00:05:43,487 --> 00:05:46,206
Oh, excuse me, Frasier Crane,
Phillip Donovan, the current owner.

120
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,356
- Hello.
- Hi.

121
00:05:47,527 --> 00:05:49,199
LANA: I'll see you later, Phillip.
- Anyway,

122
00:05:49,367 --> 00:05:53,360
my wife just left with the kids.
No talking, no explanations,

123
00:05:53,567 --> 00:05:56,718
just ripped my heart out,
threw it to the dogs.

124
00:05:56,887 --> 00:05:59,242
Which she also took.

125
00:06:00,207 --> 00:06:03,916
Well, at least you're getting out
at the top of the market.

126
00:06:04,087 --> 00:06:06,965
Actually, this is a very good time,
Phillip, and I think today is the day.

127
00:06:07,127 --> 00:06:08,685
- Oh, no.
- Oh, God.

128
00:06:08,847 --> 00:06:10,075
What's wrong?

129
00:06:10,247 --> 00:06:11,885
The damn basement
must have flooded again.

130
00:06:12,047 --> 00:06:14,436
Everything in this box is ruined.

131
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:18,441
Little Susie's cap she wore home
from the hospital. Ruined.

132
00:06:18,647 --> 00:06:21,844
Danny's first soccer uniform. Ruined.

133
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:24,567
Well, you know,
I have an excellent dry cleaner.

134
00:06:24,727 --> 00:06:26,285
LANA:
No.

135
00:06:28,087 --> 00:06:34,276
Once, actually, I spilled butter
on a pair of white velvet pantaloons.

136
00:06:34,967 --> 00:06:38,880
Well, it's a long story,
but he had it out in under a minute.

137
00:06:39,047 --> 00:06:40,639
- Just give him the address.
FRASIER: Yes.

138
00:06:40,807 --> 00:06:45,403
I have two sons and two daughters.
The perfect American family.

139
00:06:45,567 --> 00:06:49,958
Until that bastard Lamar showed up
to snake our drains.

140
00:06:50,567 --> 00:06:53,400
Now all I have left are weekend visits

141
00:06:53,567 --> 00:06:56,365
and a few treasures
from their childhood.

142
00:06:56,527 --> 00:07:00,486
Like this house little Danny and I
made at day camp.

143
00:07:00,647 --> 00:07:03,525
Oh, thank goodness,
it made it through unscathed.

144
00:07:03,727 --> 00:07:06,605
Just a little water damage
in the basement.

145
00:07:06,767 --> 00:07:09,645
- Just like this house.
- Oh, well...

146
00:07:09,807 --> 00:07:13,641
Yes, well, Phillip,
you are still their father.

147
00:07:13,807 --> 00:07:15,877
I mean,
I know things seem difficult right now,

148
00:07:16,047 --> 00:07:17,526
but believe me, it'll get easier.

149
00:07:17,727 --> 00:07:21,515
Well, it's already easier.
I mean, look at me, I'm dressed.

150
00:07:21,727 --> 00:07:24,525
You know what would cheer you up
is to make a killing on this house.

151
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:26,804
Now don't you think
you should get back to work?

152
00:07:26,967 --> 00:07:27,956
Yeah, I guess.

153
00:07:28,127 --> 00:07:30,880
That air traffic
isn't gonna control itself.

154
00:07:32,847 --> 00:07:34,917
LANA: Okay, here we go out...
No, not the front door.

155
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:37,885
Let's go out the side door.
Gosh, good to see you again, Phillip.

156
00:07:38,047 --> 00:07:40,356
I'll call you real soon. Thanks, bye.

157
00:07:40,687 --> 00:07:42,757
Well, that man is obviously in pain.

158
00:07:42,927 --> 00:07:45,521
The least you could be
is a little sympathetic.

159
00:07:45,687 --> 00:07:48,918
I have been sympathetic
for 15 months.

160
00:07:49,087 --> 00:07:50,964
I had him over for Thanksgiving.

161
00:07:51,567 --> 00:07:53,876
He got drunk the first half-hour
and cried himself to sleep

162
00:07:54,047 --> 00:07:56,163
in my coat closet.

163
00:07:56,687 --> 00:07:58,279
And I consider that
one of our good days.

164
00:07:58,447 --> 00:08:02,440
Well, so where are these
so-called buyers of yours?

165
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:05,075
- You told me they'd be here.
- They're obviously running late.

166
00:08:05,247 --> 00:08:07,807
- It'll give us time to go over the plan.
- What? There's a plan?

167
00:08:07,967 --> 00:08:10,959
Well, sure. When the Smolenski's get
here, you act like you want the house.

168
00:08:11,127 --> 00:08:13,687
You know, a little competition.
Put a little pressure on the deal.

169
00:08:13,847 --> 00:08:15,405
You're asking me to be your shill?

170
00:08:15,567 --> 00:08:17,285
That's the word. Yes, yes.

171
00:08:18,287 --> 00:08:20,482
Now listen, listen.
No, you don't have to say anything.

172
00:08:20,647 --> 00:08:23,036
- Well, I'm sorry, no.
- Well, why the...?

173
00:08:23,207 --> 00:08:26,244
Look, all you have to do is walk around
with an interested look on your face.

174
00:08:26,407 --> 00:08:28,602
- They'll fill in the rest.
- I will do no such thing.

175
00:08:28,767 --> 00:08:31,361
- Why won't you help me?
- Because I refuse to lie for you.

176
00:08:31,567 --> 00:08:34,286
- Fine, then go wait in the car.
- I never wanted to leave the car.

177
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:35,436
Oh, just get out!

178
00:08:48,007 --> 00:08:49,998
All right, I got some Creamsicles,
and Fudgesicles,

179
00:08:50,167 --> 00:08:53,239
and something they call Bomb Pops.

180
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:55,921
Well, I called the Smolenskis.
I bought us a little extra time.

181
00:08:56,087 --> 00:09:00,638
Right, good, good, fine. Spread out
some paper and then build us a house.

182
00:09:00,807 --> 00:09:04,197
So, Frasier,
with all your talk about honesty,

183
00:09:04,367 --> 00:09:06,164
how do you justify faking this thing?

184
00:09:06,367 --> 00:09:10,406
Well, we're simply protecting
the feelings of an innocent man.

185
00:09:10,567 --> 00:09:12,717
There's nothing dishonest
about that.

186
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:14,201
Uh-huh.

187
00:09:14,367 --> 00:09:19,760
So, are you gonna write,
"I love you, Daddy" or am I?

188
00:09:21,687 --> 00:09:23,439
I'll do it.

189
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:29,246
Sit. Wave, wave.

190
00:09:29,407 --> 00:09:31,602
All right, hide your eyes.
Hide your eyes.

191
00:09:31,807 --> 00:09:33,559
Hide them, hide them.
Hide your eyes.

192
00:09:33,727 --> 00:09:34,876
- Hide your eyes.
- Hello.

193
00:09:35,047 --> 00:09:37,242
JIM: Come on, hide your eyes.
Hide your eyes.

194
00:09:37,407 --> 00:09:39,875
Hey, Eddie,
don't worry about that other dog.

195
00:09:40,047 --> 00:09:44,598
He may be bigger and flashier
and better looking,

196
00:09:44,767 --> 00:09:47,839
but you have substance.
She knows that.

197
00:09:48,047 --> 00:09:49,878
DAPHNE:
How amazing is Jim?

198
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:53,403
He's so connected to animals,
it's almost magical.

199
00:09:54,167 --> 00:09:56,806
Daphne, I've been musing
about you and me.

200
00:09:56,967 --> 00:09:58,480
- And I have a thought.
DAPHNE: Yeah?

201
00:09:58,647 --> 00:10:00,046
In every healthy relationship,

202
00:10:00,207 --> 00:10:02,118
I think there should be room
for an occasional,

203
00:10:02,287 --> 00:10:05,006
very occasional, irrational demand.

204
00:10:05,167 --> 00:10:07,078
What do you mean?

205
00:10:07,247 --> 00:10:10,762
A thing we insist the other do
or not do,

206
00:10:10,927 --> 00:10:14,556
and the other one has to do it
or not do it without question.

207
00:10:14,727 --> 00:10:17,195
- Is that fair?
- It is.

208
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:21,519
Because we each get one and
only one for our whole relationship.

209
00:10:22,047 --> 00:10:24,925
- Well, if it's important to you.
- Then it's agreed?

210
00:10:25,087 --> 00:10:27,282
- Agreed.
- Good.

211
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:30,038
Oh, I've got mine.

212
00:10:30,887 --> 00:10:32,320
- Already?
- Yes.

213
00:10:32,487 --> 00:10:36,116
I want you to promise
never to come to this dog park again.

214
00:10:36,567 --> 00:10:39,081
- What?
- I know it sounds extreme,

215
00:10:39,247 --> 00:10:43,035
it's even unreasonable, but that's
the beauty of the irrational demand.

216
00:10:43,687 --> 00:10:45,245
Is this about Jim?

217
00:10:46,047 --> 00:10:50,643
The demand cannot be scrutinised.
It's by definition, irrational.

218
00:10:50,807 --> 00:10:53,640
Are you sure this is how
you want to use your only one?

219
00:10:55,127 --> 00:10:57,800
Absolutely.
I've thought this through a lot.

220
00:10:57,967 --> 00:10:59,400
Irrationally, of course.

221
00:11:00,047 --> 00:11:01,446
Okay, if you're sure.

222
00:11:01,607 --> 00:11:04,804
I promise never to come
to this dog park again.

223
00:11:04,967 --> 00:11:08,562
Thank you.
I knew you'd understand.

224
00:11:10,607 --> 00:11:12,279
All right, we're going home.

225
00:11:12,447 --> 00:11:16,042
Tank needs to rehydrate,
and I'm late for a deltoid workout.

226
00:11:16,207 --> 00:11:17,845
Well, I guess this is goodbye, Jim.

227
00:11:18,007 --> 00:11:21,716
Yep, by this time next week
I'll be leading my first raft tour in Chile.

228
00:11:21,887 --> 00:11:22,876
- Really?
- Yeah.

229
00:11:23,047 --> 00:11:25,322
- Wow, when do you get back?
- Oh, he's not coming back.

230
00:11:25,487 --> 00:11:27,045
He's moving there.

231
00:11:27,767 --> 00:11:30,406
- Good luck, Jim.
- Yes, you too.

232
00:11:30,887 --> 00:11:32,366
- Take care.
- And stay cool, buddy.

233
00:11:32,527 --> 00:11:34,438
Oh, you know it.

234
00:11:40,727 --> 00:11:43,400
I wonder how I'll use
my irrational demand.

235
00:11:45,567 --> 00:11:50,163
Oh, what's my rush?
I've got years to think it over.

236
00:12:07,047 --> 00:12:10,596
- Hi, Martin.
- Oh, hello, Joanne.

237
00:12:11,287 --> 00:12:14,723
- How have you been?
- Pretty good.

238
00:12:14,887 --> 00:12:17,845
- Oh, please, have a seat.
- Thanks.

239
00:12:18,127 --> 00:12:21,164
I was worried I was going to be late
with all that construction going on.

240
00:12:21,327 --> 00:12:24,046
Yeah, I know. It's a mess.

241
00:12:24,727 --> 00:12:25,921
How's your hip?

242
00:12:26,607 --> 00:12:28,199
Oh, you learn to live with it.

243
00:12:30,127 --> 00:12:31,958
I think about you a lot, you know.

244
00:12:34,527 --> 00:12:36,916
I've wanted to call, but...

245
00:12:37,447 --> 00:12:38,675
I don't know.

246
00:12:38,887 --> 00:12:41,447
Oh, I understand. It's okay.

247
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:50,086
- So, another year has gone by.
- Yeah, time really flies.

248
00:12:52,407 --> 00:12:55,285
I guess it goes a little slower for me.

249
00:12:59,407 --> 00:13:01,045
- How's our roof coming?
- Almost done.

250
00:13:01,207 --> 00:13:02,560
Good.

251
00:13:04,047 --> 00:13:06,607
You know, there was a time
back in high school

252
00:13:07,367 --> 00:13:12,043
when I would have paid a thousand
dollars to watch you eat a Popsicle.

253
00:13:18,527 --> 00:13:20,597
It was a long time ago.

254
00:13:23,527 --> 00:13:26,325
I think it's kind of funny
that we became friends.

255
00:13:26,487 --> 00:13:28,364
We're friends?

256
00:13:28,967 --> 00:13:32,926
Well, sure we are.
Why wouldn't you think so?

257
00:13:33,327 --> 00:13:36,876
- Oh, dear.
- Nice going, dipstick.

258
00:13:37,047 --> 00:13:39,402
It's a brand new shirt.

259
00:13:41,367 --> 00:13:43,278
I hear a car. It's the Smolenskis.

260
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:45,119
- Okay, keep working.
- Right.

261
00:13:45,287 --> 00:13:47,847
I've got to go to Phillip's room,
spray some air freshener around.

262
00:13:48,007 --> 00:13:53,127
His room reeks of,
I don't know, despair.

263
00:14:20,247 --> 00:14:24,206
It's even nicer than I remember.

264
00:14:24,367 --> 00:14:25,595
Well, hello there.

265
00:14:27,247 --> 00:14:30,956
Are you having fun
making your little house?

266
00:14:33,687 --> 00:14:37,805
Oh, hi. Oh, there you are.
Hi. Oh, I see you've met Frasier.

267
00:14:37,967 --> 00:14:39,923
You know,
I'm so glad you came today,

268
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:42,282
because the interest on this place
is really heating up.

269
00:14:42,447 --> 00:14:44,039
Well, we're certainly interested
as well,

270
00:14:44,207 --> 00:14:48,041
but we heard that a lot of homes
in this area have a flooding problem.

271
00:14:48,207 --> 00:14:50,960
Now what do you know
about the basement here?

272
00:14:51,607 --> 00:14:53,040
LANA: Honestly?
SMOLENSKl: Yes.

273
00:14:53,207 --> 00:14:54,401
This house is 60 years old,

274
00:14:54,567 --> 00:14:57,479
and I have only heard of it
flooding once.

275
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,241
[COUGHS]

276
00:15:00,327 --> 00:15:02,397
And I can tell you for a fact
that the current owner

277
00:15:02,567 --> 00:15:05,639
stores some of his most cherished
keepsakes in that basement.

278

[FRASIER COUGHING]

279
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:10,202
Are you choking on your lolly?

280
00:15:13,767 --> 00:15:18,443
No. I am choking on something
far more dangerous and destructive

281
00:15:18,607 --> 00:15:20,996
than a simple sugary treat.

282
00:15:22,887 --> 00:15:27,802
It's a prolific and powerful poison
known as deception.

283
00:15:28,447 --> 00:15:31,120
He's very verbal.

284
00:15:35,087 --> 00:15:37,920
Oh, you know, I just remembered.

285
00:15:38,087 --> 00:15:40,157
Gosh, you know,
the owner did mention something

286
00:15:40,327 --> 00:15:44,081
about a recent
little moisture problem downstairs.

287
00:15:44,247 --> 00:15:46,920
Why don't I give him a call and see
if he'll come down in the price?

288
00:15:47,087 --> 00:15:48,076
Oh, that'd be wonderful.

289
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:51,000
If you give us a break in the price,
I'm sure we'll make an offer.

290
00:15:51,167 --> 00:15:53,476
- Great, I'll call you tonight.
MRS. SMOLENSKl: Thank you, Lana.

291
00:15:53,647 --> 00:15:56,366
- Sure.
- Goodbye, sonny.

292
00:15:56,527 --> 00:15:58,597
LANA:
Call you tonight.

293
00:15:58,767 --> 00:16:00,439
Bye-bye.

294
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:05,040
There, now, you see?
You did the right thing.

295
00:16:05,207 --> 00:16:08,836
- It wasn't so bad, was it?
- I guess not.

296
00:16:09,007 --> 00:16:12,443
Oh, look at our little house.
It looks great.

297
00:16:14,287 --> 00:16:16,005
Say,
we've got a few Popsicle sticks left.

298
00:16:16,167 --> 00:16:18,476
Why don't we add on a half a bath?

299

Frasier.

00:16:20,887 --> 00:16:24,562
You know, Lana, I think the house
should go the other way around,
