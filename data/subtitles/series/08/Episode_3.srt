1
00:00:08,047 --> 00:00:11,005
Well, Roz, I think we have just
enough time for one more call.

2
00:00:11,207 --> 00:00:14,005
Okay, we have Andy
from Bremerton on line three.

3
00:00:14,647 --> 00:00:16,842
Hello, Andy, I'm listening.

4
00:00:17,007 --> 00:00:18,884
MAN: <i>Am I on?</i>
- Yes, go ahead.

5
00:00:19,047 --> 00:00:20,685
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

6
00:00:20,847 --> 00:00:22,075
Yes, you're on the air.

7
00:00:22,247 --> 00:00:24,807
- <i>Hello?</i>
- You're on.

8
00:00:24,967 --> 00:00:27,720
- <i>Am I on?</i>
- Not anymore.

9
00:00:28,767 --> 00:00:34,000
This is Dr. Frasier Crane on KACL
wishing you good mental health.

10
00:00:34,167 --> 00:00:36,920
- Gather around, everyone.
FRASIER: Oh, Kenny, what's all this?

11
00:00:37,087 --> 00:00:40,124
I'm here to officially announce
this year's SeaBea nominations.

12
00:00:40,327 --> 00:00:41,760
- Ooh!
- Oh, well.

13
00:00:41,967 --> 00:00:45,004
He made us wait until your show
was over. It was interminable.

14
00:00:46,687 --> 00:00:50,805
First of all, KACL has been nominated
for a total of nine SeaBeas.

15
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:52,764
- Isn't that great?
WOMAN: Oh, that's great.

16
00:00:52,967 --> 00:00:55,959
Which ties us with KPX,
the mighty PIXY

17
00:00:56,607 --> 00:00:58,802
- for most nominations.
- The mighty PIXY, they do well.

18
00:00:58,967 --> 00:01:01,037
All the nominees were chosen
by a panel of experts...

19
00:01:01,207 --> 00:01:03,402
- Give me that.
- Good girl, Roz.

20
00:01:03,567 --> 00:01:06,764
Oh, oh, here's one.
Best restaurant critic, Gil Chesterton.

21
00:01:06,927 --> 00:01:08,838
Oh, congratulations, Gil.

22
00:01:09,047 --> 00:01:10,878
Thank God I'm nominated.

23
00:01:11,047 --> 00:01:12,924
And I won't have to attend
the Chestertons.

24
00:01:13,127 --> 00:01:14,446
The Chestertons?

25
00:01:14,647 --> 00:01:16,877
It's an elaborate awards show
my wife and the dogs put on

26
00:01:17,047 --> 00:01:19,356
when I'm overlooked
by the SeaBeas.

27
00:01:20,407 --> 00:01:21,806
Roz, I don't see our names
anywhere.

28
00:01:21,967 --> 00:01:24,765
No, nothing.
We've been shut out. I can't believe it.

29
00:01:24,927 --> 00:01:27,964
Well, what do I have here?

30
00:01:28,167 --> 00:01:31,204
- There are more awards?
KENNY: Maybe.

31
00:01:31,407 --> 00:01:34,001

and find out.

Give me that.

34
00:01:39,367 --> 00:01:42,837
Oh, my God, Frasier, you're getting
the Lifetime Achievement Award.

35
00:01:43,047 --> 00:01:44,719
What? Are you serious?

36
00:01:47,567 --> 00:01:49,603
Give me that.

37
00:01:50,127 --> 00:01:51,162
Hurts, doesn't it?

38
00:01:56,247 --> 00:02:00,445
When I was a boy, my parents
told me to reach for the stars.

39
00:02:00,607 --> 00:02:03,519
Sadly, I later learned that stars

40
00:02:03,687 --> 00:02:09,125
are just massive, fiery balls of gas,

41
00:02:09,287 --> 00:02:14,839
which, were I to reach one,
would vaporise me instantly.

42
00:02:16,047 --> 00:02:17,196
But tonight,

43
00:02:18,287 --> 00:02:20,642
with the Stephen R. Shafer
Lifetime Achievement Award,

44
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:26,518
you tell me
that I have reached you, and you,

45
00:02:26,687 --> 00:02:31,397
ladies and gentlemen, are my stars.

46
00:02:31,567 --> 00:02:33,080
And that's where
you would applaud.

47
00:02:44,407 --> 00:02:46,967
I gotta say, Fras, it's really something,
you getting this award.

48
00:02:47,127 --> 00:02:48,685
Yes, Dad,
it's actually quite an honour.

You know, customarily they
give them out to much older people.

51
00:02:53,127 --> 00:02:55,846
Oh, Niles. Flowers,
how very thoughtful of you.

52
00:02:56,007 --> 00:02:58,396
- They're not from me.
- Well, thank you for bringing them up.

53
00:02:58,567 --> 00:02:59,841
They were just outside the door.

54
00:03:00,007 --> 00:03:01,565
Thanks for bending over
to pick them up.

55

- It's my old mentor from Harvard, Dad.

00:03:19,367 --> 00:03:21,198
Gosh, you know,
I read in the Alumni Newsletter

60
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:24,165
that he was taking his sabbatical here
at the University of Washington.

61
00:03:24,327 --> 00:03:27,364
- I've been meaning to call him.
- Niles, there's something here for you.

62
00:03:27,527 --> 00:03:28,642
For me? What for?

63
00:03:28,847 --> 00:03:30,280
Well, this may be Frasier's night,

64
00:03:30,447 --> 00:03:33,200
but I just want you to know
that I have two special sons.

Oh, well...

66
00:03:34,607 --> 00:03:36,120

Oh, darling, you're undone.

00:03:57,087 --> 00:03:58,918
I know.
This dress used to fit perfectly.

Now I can't even get it zipped
halfway up.

Well, maybe if I put a jacket on.
Will you come help me pick one out?

81

Sure, sure.
You should switch dry cleaners.

82

That's the third dress
they've shrunk this week.

"Congratulations, Frasier,
you must be very proud."

Well, I'd say he's happy for you.

Of course, I was a detective,
so it comes easy to me.

87
00:04:33,687 --> 00:04:36,281
He doesn't say he's proud of me.

88
00:04:36,447 --> 00:04:38,642
He says that I should be proud
of myself.

89
00:04:38,807 --> 00:04:42,117
- Doesn't that seem a bit odd to you?
- No, you're splitting hairs.

90

You don't know Dr. Tewksbury
like I do.

91
00:04:44,127 --> 00:04:45,958
He wouldn't say something like this

92
00:04:46,127 --> 00:04:47,685
unless he meant
to say something else.

93
00:04:48,167 --> 00:04:50,397
You're gonna let this ruin
the night for you, aren't you?

94
00:04:50,607 --> 00:04:54,395
No, no, of course not, Dad.
I just think it's interesting, that's all.

95
00:04:55,047 --> 00:04:56,878
I'm gonna head over
the SeaBeas a little early.

00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:58,366
- I'll see you there.
- Why?

97
00:04:58,567 --> 00:05:02,162
Well, I thought I should familiarise
myself with the dais.

98
00:05:02,367 --> 00:05:04,198
- Frasier, it's just a note.
- I know, Dad.

99
00:05:04,367 --> 00:05:06,244
- It doesn't mean anything.
- I know, Dad.

100
00:05:06,447 --> 00:05:09,883
- Say hi to Dr. Tewksbury for me.
- I will, Dad.

101
00:05:12,727 --> 00:05:14,763
Dr. Tewksbury?

00:05:15,287 --> 00:05:16,356
Frasier Crane.

103
00:05:16,567 --> 00:05:17,795
Of course.

104
00:05:18,007 --> 00:05:23,001
- Frasier. Oh, it's good to see you.
- Likewise.

105
00:05:23,167 --> 00:05:27,240
- How long has it been?
- Oh, gosh, l... Gee, perhaps 20 years.

106
00:05:27,447 --> 00:05:29,165
- That long?
- Yes.

107
00:05:29,327 --> 00:05:31,238
Actually, I was on my way
to the awards ceremony,

108
00:05:31,407 --> 00:05:33,921
and I thought I'd drop by
and thank you for the flowers.

109
00:05:34,807 --> 00:05:36,126
- And the card.
- You're welcome.

110
00:05:36,287 --> 00:05:38,482
- It was very thoughtful of you.
- I was happy to do it.

111
00:05:38,647 --> 00:05:40,558
- Particularly the card.
- I'm glad you liked it.

112
00:05:40,727 --> 00:05:42,046
All right, let's cut the bull.

113
00:05:43,447 --> 00:05:45,677
"You must be very proud."

114
00:05:45,847 --> 00:05:48,077
Why not "I'm proud of you"?

115
00:05:48,287 --> 00:05:51,359
Why speculation
rather than declaration?

116
00:05:51,527 --> 00:05:53,483
- What?
- We both know there are no mistakes.

117
00:05:53,647 --> 00:05:56,286
There must have been some reason,
either conscious or subconscious,

118
00:05:56,447 --> 00:05:58,836
that you chose these words.

119
00:05:59,047 --> 00:06:01,197
Frasier,
I have a confession to make.

120
00:06:01,367 --> 00:06:03,801
- Ah.
- My assistant wrote the card.

121
00:06:03,967 --> 00:06:05,116
Oh.

122
00:06:05,287 --> 00:06:06,845
When I heard
you were getting an award,

123
00:06:07,007 --> 00:06:10,602
I asked her to send flowers
with a note of congratulations.

124
00:06:10,807 --> 00:06:13,162
I'm afraid you've been
over-analysing.

125
00:06:13,367 --> 00:06:15,244
I see.

126
00:06:16,047 --> 00:06:19,642
Then again, perhaps
in that order to your assistant,

127
00:06:19,807 --> 00:06:22,002
you subconsciously
communicated an emotion

128
00:06:22,167 --> 00:06:24,761
that you couldn't
or didn't want to acknowledge.

129
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:27,356
Or perhaps your subconscious
assigned new meaning

130
00:06:27,527 --> 00:06:29,836
to the words to reflect
your own self-doubt.

131
00:06:30,047 --> 00:06:33,960
But all art is self-portraiture,
and that includes the written word.

132
00:06:34,167 --> 00:06:37,159
However, we can only view art
through the lens of our own psyches.

133
00:06:37,367 --> 00:06:38,800
Then there is no pure art.

134
00:06:39,007 --> 00:06:40,520
How would you know?

135
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:43,722
God, I've missed you.

136
00:06:43,887 --> 00:06:46,117
Oh, Frasier.

137
00:06:46,647 --> 00:06:47,875
Of course I'm proud of you.

138
00:06:48,047 --> 00:06:50,356
Oh, thank you.
It's so nice to know that.

139
00:06:50,527 --> 00:06:52,199
It really is. Thank you.

140
00:06:52,407 --> 00:06:53,920
I really wish
we had more time to talk,

141
00:06:54,087 --> 00:06:55,839
but I'm taking my wife out
to dinner tonight.

142
00:06:56,007 --> 00:06:58,043
I wanna pick up some flowers
before the shops close.

143
00:06:58,207 --> 00:06:59,242
Yes, yes, of course.

144
00:06:59,407 --> 00:07:02,365
This time,
I think I'll write the card myself.

145
00:07:02,567 --> 00:07:04,637
Yes, that's a good idea.

146
00:07:05,887 --> 00:07:07,718
Gosh, it was great to see you again.

147
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,440
Yes.

148
00:07:09,607 --> 00:07:11,916
- Let's get together some evening.
- Oh, I'd like that.

149
00:07:12,087 --> 00:07:14,282
It's not often I get to dine
with the recipient

150
00:07:14,487 --> 00:07:16,045
of a lifetime achievement award.

151
00:07:16,247 --> 00:07:19,523
Please, it's just a trinket
for a little radio show I do.

152
00:07:19,687 --> 00:07:22,440
Oh, not that by "little"
I mean to minimise my achievement.

153
00:07:22,647 --> 00:07:23,716
- I know.
- I know you know.

154
00:07:23,887 --> 00:07:24,922
I just wanna be clear,

155
00:07:25,127 --> 00:07:28,039
so that you don't infer any meanings
that aren't actually there.

156
00:07:28,247 --> 00:07:29,396
What might I infer?

157
00:07:29,607 --> 00:07:32,644
Oh, that I'm somehow dissatisfied
with my work, something like that.

158
00:07:32,847 --> 00:07:34,758
You also called the award a "trinket."

159
00:07:34,927 --> 00:07:36,838
Can you imagine
what I might have done with that?

160
00:07:37,007 --> 00:07:38,281
FRASIER:
Yes, exactly.

161
00:07:38,487 --> 00:07:41,559
A lesser therapist might say
that I didn't think much of an award

162
00:07:41,727 --> 00:07:44,036
that they're willing to give
to the likes of me.

163
00:07:44,247 --> 00:07:46,636
Mm. I suppose if one
were looking hard enough,

164
00:07:46,807 --> 00:07:48,445
one could even say
your coming down here

165
00:07:48,607 --> 00:07:50,598
was a desperate quest for approval.

166
00:07:50,807 --> 00:07:55,198
Oh, well, that one's
a little out there. Yes.

167
00:07:55,407 --> 00:07:59,764
Frasier, you don't have to worry.
I'm not inferring anything.

168
00:07:59,967 --> 00:08:03,039
Enjoy yourself this evening.

169
00:08:03,207 --> 00:08:04,640
I will.

170
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:08,837
- Because tonight is my night.
- Yes.

171
00:08:09,967 --> 00:08:12,401
- So long, professor.
- Goodbye.

172
00:08:14,287 --> 00:08:16,847
Oh, Frasier.

173
00:08:17,007 --> 00:08:18,076
[CHUCKLES]

174
00:08:24,647 --> 00:08:25,796
Frasier?

175
00:08:27,247 --> 00:08:29,283
What the hell is wrong with me?

176
00:08:34,207 --> 00:08:36,516
Yes, dear,
I know we have reservations,

177
00:08:36,687 --> 00:08:39,997
but one of my former students
is having a minor crisis.

178
00:08:40,167 --> 00:08:41,395
I'll be there in half an hour.

179
00:08:41,567 --> 00:08:44,764
What does it all mean?

180
00:08:46,327 --> 00:08:48,522
Make it an hour.

181
00:08:51,927 --> 00:08:55,237
- Hello, everybody.
MARTIN: Oh, hey, Roz. Whoa!

182
00:08:55,447 --> 00:08:58,245
- You look great, Roz.
- Yeah. That's a beautiful dress.

183
00:08:58,407 --> 00:08:59,965
Thank you,
and after two weeks of eating

184
00:09:00,127 --> 00:09:03,517
delicious fat-burning cabbage soup,
it finally fits.

185
00:09:04,327 --> 00:09:06,522
Niles made me cabbage
with me Osso Buco last night.

186
00:09:06,687 --> 00:09:09,599
If I knew it burned fat,
I would have had a fourth helping.

187
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,401
- Well, we do have leftovers.
- No, we don't.

188
00:09:14,727 --> 00:09:16,877
I haven't seen Daphne in a while.
Is it my imagination?

189
00:09:17,047 --> 00:09:20,164
No. Six squares a day.

190
00:09:20,327 --> 00:09:22,397
That's not like her.
Maybe she's depressed.

191
00:09:22,567 --> 00:09:24,478
That's when I eat.
Have you said anything to her?

192
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:27,605
No. Timing is very delicate
in something like this, Roz.

193
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:30,201
I thought I'd wait until after she gets
too big to catch me,

194
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:33,757
but before she needs
the motorised scooter.

195
00:09:36,327 --> 00:09:37,885
Hey, has anyone seen Frasier?

196
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:39,799
No, not yet.
What's the matter? You look pale.

197
00:09:39,967 --> 00:09:41,195
Well, I hate public speaking,

198
00:09:41,367 --> 00:09:43,437
and they roped me
into giving Frasier's introduction.

199
00:09:43,607 --> 00:09:45,120
I just wanna make sure it's okay.

200
00:09:45,327 --> 00:09:47,477
Why don't you run it by Niles?
He's a psychiatrist too.

201
00:09:47,647 --> 00:09:51,196
And he's just as smart
and successful as Frasier.

202
00:09:51,367 --> 00:09:54,040
- Dad.
- It's true. You are.

203
00:09:54,207 --> 00:09:55,481
He is.

204
00:09:57,287 --> 00:10:00,324
Hey, Gil.
So where is that elusive wife of yours?

205
00:10:00,487 --> 00:10:03,604
If you must know, Deb's
on manoeuvres with her reserve unit.

Ladies and gentlemen,

welcome to this year's
Seattle Broadcasting Awards.

208
00:10:12,087 --> 00:10:16,205
Let's get right to our first category,
Outstanding Restaurant Critic.

209
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:21,356
And the nominees are:
Merrill George for <i>Café Chat,</i>

210
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:25,037
Sheldon Hastings
for <i>Here's Looking at Food</i>

211
00:10:25,247 --> 00:10:28,045
and Gil Chesterton
for <i>Restaurant Beat.</i>

[CHEERING]

213
00:10:30,927 --> 00:10:33,122
And we have a tie.

214
00:10:33,327 --> 00:10:36,637
They expect me to share?
What is this, dim sum?

215
00:10:36,807 --> 00:10:41,483
And the SeaBeas go to Merrill George
and Sheldon Hastings.

216
00:10:44,767 --> 00:10:46,359
This can't be happening.

217
00:10:47,327 --> 00:10:49,761
Oh, come on, Gil,
isn't it enough just to be nominated?

218
00:10:49,967 --> 00:10:53,118
You tell me, Miss Three-Time-Loser.

219
00:10:56,407 --> 00:10:57,965
MAN:
To all my listeners...

220
00:10:59,527 --> 00:11:03,122
FRASIER: I know I should be happy,
but I feel so dissatisfied.

221
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:05,676
Well, Frasier, it's no accident

222
00:11:05,847 --> 00:11:07,439
that you're going through this
on the day

223
00:11:07,607 --> 00:11:11,520
that you receive
your lifetime achievement award.

224
00:11:11,727 --> 00:11:15,242
Well, duh. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm just acting out.

225
00:11:15,407 --> 00:11:18,843
Please, please. Continue, please.

226
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,846
As you know,

227
00:11:22,047 --> 00:11:26,563
men in our society commonly
define themselves by their careers.

228
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:28,524
Yes, I'll cop to that. Yeah.

229
00:11:28,687 --> 00:11:30,962
In fact, there's nothing
I'm more proud of than my career.

230
00:11:31,127 --> 00:11:33,880
It's because I love to help people.
I always have.

231
00:11:34,047 --> 00:11:35,162
Right. Refresh my memory.

232
00:11:35,367 --> 00:11:37,517
Wasn't it your mother
who first sparked

233
00:11:37,687 --> 00:11:39,405
your interest in psychiatry?

234
00:11:39,607 --> 00:11:43,122
Yes, it was.
I remember the exact day.

235
00:11:43,287 --> 00:11:45,960
I was 8.

236
00:11:46,127 --> 00:11:48,925
I had come home crying because one
of the older boys had thrown my copy

237
00:11:49,087 --> 00:11:50,839
of <i>The Fountainhead</i> under a bus.

238
00:11:51,727 --> 00:11:54,082
My mother explained to me

239
00:11:54,287 --> 00:11:56,721
it wasn't because he didn't like
the way I walked,

240
00:11:56,887 --> 00:11:59,879
or because
I wore an ascot to school.

241
00:12:00,047 --> 00:12:02,925
It was because
he didn't like himself.

242
00:12:03,087 --> 00:12:06,602
And at that very moment,

243
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:08,485
I became a student
of human behaviour.

244
00:12:08,647 --> 00:12:11,286
It was as if someone had given me
an instruction manual

245
00:12:11,447 --> 00:12:13,756
explaining why people
acted the way they did.

246
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:18,597
Not to mention a way to distance
yourself from painful emotions.

247
00:12:18,807 --> 00:12:20,365
Oh, totally.

248
00:12:20,527 --> 00:12:23,200
I took a lot of grief for that ascot.

249
00:12:23,847 --> 00:12:27,726
So you were drawn to psychiatry
not because you like to help people,

250
00:12:27,887 --> 00:12:29,684
but because you feared them.

251
00:12:31,087 --> 00:12:32,805
I feared them?

252
00:12:33,007 --> 00:12:35,202
Psychiatry gives you objectivity.

253
00:12:35,367 --> 00:12:37,835
Objectivity gives you
emotional distance.

254
00:12:38,047 --> 00:12:39,924
Distance makes you feel safe.

255
00:12:40,087 --> 00:12:42,396
Yes, yes, granted.
But what has that got to do with me?

256
00:12:42,607 --> 00:12:44,086
How's your practise?

257
00:12:44,247 --> 00:12:45,999
I don't have a practise.
I have a radio show.

258
00:12:46,167 --> 00:12:48,806
Distance. Any children?

259
00:12:49,007 --> 00:12:51,521
Yes, I have a wonderful son
with whom I'm very close.

260
00:12:51,727 --> 00:12:54,719
- You live with him?
- He lives in Boston.

261
00:12:54,927 --> 00:12:57,282
Distance. With your wife.

262
00:12:57,487 --> 00:13:00,160
My ex-wife. Yes, I know, distance.

263
00:13:00,367 --> 00:13:01,516
Wasn't she a psychiatrist?

264
00:13:01,727 --> 00:13:03,285
Yes, she happened
to be a good one too.

265
00:13:03,487 --> 00:13:04,761
That's a handy choice
for someone

266
00:13:04,927 --> 00:13:08,158
who'd rather share ideas
than emotions.

267
00:13:08,367 --> 00:13:10,483
Have you ever met Lilith?

268
00:13:11,127 --> 00:13:12,162
No.

269
00:13:12,367 --> 00:13:17,760
Well, she happens to be a very warm
and loving woman.

270
00:13:19,167 --> 00:13:22,523
Have you had any other meaningful
relationships since then?

271
00:13:22,727 --> 00:13:25,924
As a matter of fact, l...
Well, what is your point?

272
00:13:26,967 --> 00:13:31,165
My point is that at the age of 8, at 8,

273
00:13:31,327 --> 00:13:33,636
you began to use psychiatry

274
00:13:33,847 --> 00:13:36,156
as a way to deal with a world
that scared you to death.

275
00:13:36,327 --> 00:13:38,238
And this lifetime achievement award

276
00:13:38,407 --> 00:13:41,524
has made your realise
that your career is finite.

277
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:48,035
And once it's gone, all you'll have left
is that frightened 8-year-old boy.

278
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:52,885
Well...

279
00:13:55,407 --> 00:13:57,477
Would you like to hear my theory?

280
00:13:58,247 --> 00:14:00,522
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

281
00:14:00,727 --> 00:14:03,799
I am not an 8-year-old.

282
00:14:03,967 --> 00:14:07,323
And you know something else?
You're not my mentor anymore.

283
00:14:11,127 --> 00:14:13,038
Roz, you gonna eat your quiche?

284
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:14,282
Are you kidding?

285
00:14:14,447 --> 00:14:16,483
This would be like pulling
the ripcord on my thighs.

286
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:19,480
It's nothing but cheese
and butter and pastry...

287
00:14:19,687 --> 00:14:21,678
And bacon.
Are you sure you don't mind?

288
00:14:24,167 --> 00:14:25,202
I have good news.

289
00:14:25,367 --> 00:14:26,959
I just spoke to Frasier.
He's on his way.

290
00:14:27,127 --> 00:14:28,162
Oh, thank goodness.

291
00:14:28,327 --> 00:14:32,081
Oh, not that I'm not having
a good time with you, Niles.

292
00:14:32,287 --> 00:14:35,245
Dad, I know what you're doing.
You don't have to overcompensate.

293
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:38,399
I'm not some green-eyed monster
burning with envy for Frasier.

294
00:14:38,567 --> 00:14:42,606
All right, but if you were,
I bet you'd be a great one.

295
00:14:45,167 --> 00:14:47,556
Daphne?
I haven't seen you in a while.

296
00:14:47,727 --> 00:14:49,319
How have you been? Are you okay?

297
00:14:50,687 --> 00:14:54,441
I'm better than okay.
I'm in love with a man who loves me.

298
00:14:54,607 --> 00:14:56,563
He showers me with attention.

299
00:14:56,727 --> 00:15:00,402
Every morning I wake up wondering
what treasures this day will bring.

300
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:03,206
It really is the happiest time
of my life.

301
00:15:04,647 --> 00:15:05,841
And how are you?

302
00:15:06,567 --> 00:15:08,319
Good.

303
00:15:09,247 --> 00:15:10,282
Really good.

304
00:15:12,567 --> 00:15:15,240
Could you pass me
Frasier's quiche?

305
00:15:20,567 --> 00:15:22,558
And the butter.

306
00:15:24,127 --> 00:15:25,401
Thank you.

307
00:15:26,567 --> 00:15:28,558
All right, I hate to be the one
to break it to you,

308
00:15:28,727 --> 00:15:30,638
but I'm afraid you've lost your touch.

309
00:15:30,807 --> 00:15:33,640
- Where's your DSM?
- There.

310
00:15:34,367 --> 00:15:37,916
Emotionally stunted 8-year-old,
my eye.

311
00:15:38,367 --> 00:15:40,835
Ah. Here's what I'm going through.

312
00:15:41,007 --> 00:15:42,486
Phase-of-life issue.

313
00:15:42,647 --> 00:15:46,003
"A problem associated
with a particular developmental phase

314
00:15:46,167 --> 00:15:48,806
or other life circumstances."

315
00:15:49,007 --> 00:15:51,441
- Please, a mid-life crisis?
- It's obvious, really.

316
00:15:51,607 --> 00:15:53,279
I'm surprised
it didn't occur to me sooner.

317
00:15:53,447 --> 00:15:56,086
If someone had called with
this problem, I'd have diagnosed it.

318
00:15:56,287 --> 00:15:58,403
- Then what would you have done?
- Depends on the caller.

319
00:15:58,607 --> 00:16:00,325
All right.

320
00:16:00,967 --> 00:16:06,280
The caller is you.

321
00:16:10,167 --> 00:16:11,361
Fine.

322
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:14,323
On line one,

323
00:16:14,487 --> 00:16:19,766
we have Frasier Crane
from Seattle.

324
00:16:22,327 --> 00:16:24,682
Hello, Dr. Crane.

325
00:16:24,847 --> 00:16:27,122
I love your show. I'm a big fan.

326
00:16:31,767 --> 00:16:36,283
I won't bore you with all the details
of my life because you know them.

327
00:16:37,647 --> 00:16:42,163
Suffice to say,
I'm a successful psychiatrist.

328
00:16:42,327 --> 00:16:44,602
My problem is that,

329
00:16:45,487 --> 00:16:48,047
in spite of the life I've built,

330
00:16:49,087 --> 00:16:50,964
I feel...

331
00:16:54,127 --> 00:16:55,879
...empty.

332
00:17:05,047 --> 00:17:08,278
Ah. Emptiness.

333
00:17:08,447 --> 00:17:10,563
The eternal void.

334
00:17:10,767 --> 00:17:12,723
If I'm not mistaken,
it was John Keats who wrote...

335
00:17:12,927 --> 00:17:15,395
Stalling. Deal with the feelings.

336
00:17:16,607 --> 00:17:18,518
All right, fair enough.

337
00:17:18,687 --> 00:17:20,723
Perhaps, caller,
if we re-frame the issue, we can...

338
00:17:20,927 --> 00:17:24,044
Redefining the problem.
Deal with the feelings.

339
00:17:24,807 --> 00:17:26,604
Uh...

340
00:17:26,767 --> 00:17:28,598
Let's run down
the Beck Depression Inventory...

341
00:17:28,807 --> 00:17:30,525
Re-diagnosing.
You know what the problem is.

342
00:17:30,687 --> 00:17:32,917
- The caller feels empty. Go on.
- Okay.

343
00:17:34,327 --> 00:17:35,999
Last month,
in the New England Journal...

344
00:17:36,207 --> 00:17:37,879
- He's already read it.
- How do you know?

345
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:41,835
The caller is Frasier Crane.
If you did, he did.

346
00:17:42,847 --> 00:17:44,724
I can suggest certain
visualisation techniques...

347
00:17:44,887 --> 00:17:46,366
He knows them already.

348
00:17:46,567 --> 00:17:48,558
Look, if he knows all this,
then why is he calling?

349
00:17:48,727 --> 00:17:52,436
He told you.
Because he's empty. Keep going.

350
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:57,126
Well, sometimes it helps
to write yourself a letter.

351
00:17:57,327 --> 00:17:59,557
He's already got himself
on the phone.

352
00:17:59,767 --> 00:18:01,962
But I don't know what he wants.

353
00:18:02,167 --> 00:18:05,796
Then why do you keep trying
to bury him in psychiatric exercises?

354
00:18:06,007 --> 00:18:08,362
Because that's all I have.

355
00:18:16,807 --> 00:18:19,162
I'm sorry, caller.

356
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:22,717
I can't help you.

357
00:18:24,767 --> 00:18:26,359
Frasier's up next,
and he's not here yet.

358
00:18:26,527 --> 00:18:28,836
- What the hell am I gonna do?
- He'll be here in a minute.

359
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:32,044
- Just go up there and stall.
- Stall?

360
00:18:32,207 --> 00:18:34,004
Stall?

361
00:18:34,167 --> 00:18:35,202
Yes, like that.

KACL General Manager
Kenny Daly.

364
00:18:44,247 --> 00:18:45,282
I think I'm gonna be sick.

365
00:18:45,447 --> 00:18:47,403
Oh, all right, relax.
I'll go up there for you.

366
00:18:47,567 --> 00:18:49,637
No, no, Niles, let me do it.

367

This night's been hard enough
on you already.

368
00:18:55,007 --> 00:18:57,123
You are such a weenie.

369
00:18:57,287 --> 00:19:01,121
Yeah, weenie like a fox.

370
00:19:02,327 --> 00:19:05,319
Actually, ladies and gentlemen,
I'm Martin Crane.

371
00:19:05,527 --> 00:19:07,279
Kenny very kindly
let me do the honours.

372
00:19:07,447 --> 00:19:10,723
You see, I'm Frasier's dad.

373
00:19:10,887 --> 00:19:16,166
Oh, no, no, more than that,
I'm the father of two special guys.

374
00:19:16,927 --> 00:19:17,962
So if it's okay with you,

375
00:19:18,127 --> 00:19:22,564
I'd like you to give a big SeaBea
welcome to my other son, Niles.

376
00:19:22,767 --> 00:19:24,519
Come on, Niles, stand up.

377
00:19:24,687 --> 00:19:27,042
Let them see you.
Oh, here's Frasier.

Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you the winner

00:19:35,647 --> 00:19:38,684
of the Stephen R. Shafer
Lifetime Achievement Award,

381
00:19:38,847 --> 00:19:40,997
my son Frasier Crane.

382
00:19:52,247 --> 00:19:53,396
Uh...

383
00:19:54,327 --> 00:19:57,160
Thank you for honouring my life.

384
00:19:59,727 --> 00:20:02,116
I just wish I knew what to do
with the rest of it.
