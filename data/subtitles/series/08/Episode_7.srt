If you must know, I'm just about
to leave for something called

3
00:00:13,887 --> 00:00:15,366

4
00:00:15,527 --> 00:00:18,246
- What's a speed date?
- Well, apparently, it's the latest thing.

Twelve men and 12 women

They spend eight minutes
talking to one another,

7
00:00:23,087 --> 00:00:25,601
and then they move on
to the next person after a bell rings.

8
00:00:25,767 --> 00:00:30,966
Basically, it's all the stress and
humiliation of a blind date, times 12.

00:14:36,047 --> 00:14:37,480
Well, you know,
why don't we sit down?

- Okay.
- Here we are. Let me.

302
00:14:40,247 --> 00:14:42,078
I was thinking that perhaps
after the party

303
00:14:42,247 --> 00:14:44,681
we could take a carriage ride
through the park,

304
00:14:44,847 --> 00:14:46,883
make our way to your place,
where I believe

305
00:14:47,047 --> 00:14:50,801
there is a 2-pound box
of chocolate truffles waiting for you.

306
00:14:50,967 --> 00:14:52,161
Two pounds.

307
00:14:52,327 --> 00:14:54,887
Yes. Well, your sister told me
that truffles were your favourite.

308
00:14:55,047 --> 00:14:58,437
You talked to Cheryl?
Oh, I haven't talked to her in months.

309
00:14:58,647 --> 00:15:02,117
You'll have your chance on Sunday.
We're having dinner with her and Jack.

- Oh, yes, of course. I understand.

- Oh, hi, Roz.

00:15:11,887 --> 00:15:14,560
- Hi. Happy Valentine's Day.
- Same to you.

313
00:15:14,727 --> 00:15:16,479
- This is my date, Robert.
- Nice to meet you.

314
00:15:16,647 --> 00:15:17,682
Nice to meet you too.

Well, Roz, listen. Thanks for
getting me out of the house.

about meeting somebody new.
