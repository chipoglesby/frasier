Who's up next, Roz?

We have Cleo
from Redmond on line three.

Hello, Cleo. I'm listening.

CLEO:
<i>Hi, Dr. Crane.</i>

5

<i>I've been dating three different guys</i>
<i>and I can't choose between them.</i>

6
00:00:19,727 --> 00:00:22,446
Is it that you can't choose
or you don't want to choose?

7
00:00:22,607 --> 00:00:24,199
<i>It's just hard. One's really funny,</i>

<i>and one's sensitive.</i>

This show is for people
with real problems.

Roz.

13
00:00:34,247 --> 00:00:38,445
Um, it sounds to me as if each suitor
possesses one quality that you admire.

14
00:00:38,607 --> 00:00:40,518
Rather than choose among them,

15
00:00:40,687 --> 00:00:43,884
why not try to find one person
who fits all your criteria?

16
00:00:44,047 --> 00:00:46,481
Why don't you call back
when you're a working single mother

17
00:00:46,647 --> 00:00:48,797
whose choice in dates
is between a guy with eight teeth

18
00:00:48,967 --> 00:00:51,879
and a guy whose hair is painted on?

19

Sadly, we're out of time.

This is Dr. Frasier Crane

and good mental health.

22

Unless, of course,
Roz has a problem with that.

23
00:01:06,447 --> 00:01:08,085
Is there something wrong, Roz?

24
00:01:08,247 --> 00:01:09,282
Because if there is,

25
00:01:09,447 --> 00:01:12,598
we should discuss it
before it bleeds into your work.

26
00:01:13,847 --> 00:01:14,996
ROZ:
I'm sorry.

27

I'm just sick of hearing people
complain about their love lives

without plans.

- Well, I empathize, but...
- I know. Look who I'm telling.

It so happens
I have big plans this weekend.

31
00:01:29,167 --> 00:01:30,202
Let me guess:

32
00:01:30,407 --> 00:01:33,717
You and Niles are playing your
zithers again at the Renaissance Faire.

33
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:38,762
Get real, Roz. The Renaissance Faire
is a fortnight after Saint Swithin's Day.

34
00:01:39,207 --> 00:01:40,799
No, my son is coming to town.

35
00:01:40,967 --> 00:01:43,606
Dad and Daphne should be
picking him up at the airport right now.

36
00:01:43,767 --> 00:01:45,519
I didn't know Freddie was coming.

37
00:01:45,687 --> 00:01:47,484
Well, it was sort of last-minute,
actually.

38
00:01:47,647 --> 00:01:49,842
You know, you remember
I had that reunion of sorts

39
00:01:50,007 --> 00:01:52,441
with my old college mentor,
Dr. Tewksbury.

40
00:01:52,607 --> 00:01:54,518
Well, it led to a lot of soul-searching.

41
00:01:54,687 --> 00:01:56,359
He helped me to realise

42
00:01:56,527 --> 00:01:58,916
that I've been defining myself
by my career,

43
00:01:59,087 --> 00:02:01,760
and it's time
that I rearrange my priorities.

44
00:02:01,927 --> 00:02:04,964
And my first priority is my son.

45
00:02:05,327 --> 00:02:06,999
What is he now, 12?

46
00:02:07,167 --> 00:02:08,395
- No, 13, Roz.
- Wow.

47
00:02:08,567 --> 00:02:12,606
Gosh, you know,
the years really have flown by.

48
00:02:12,767 --> 00:02:16,123
- I feel like I've missed so much.
- So, what are you guys gonna do?

49
00:02:16,287 --> 00:02:19,563
Lots of things. I thought we'd see
a play and take in the computer show.

50
00:02:19,727 --> 00:02:21,206
He loved that. And, um...

51
00:02:21,367 --> 00:02:24,723
Oh, I've decided
we are going to read <i>Walden</i> together.

52
00:02:24,887 --> 00:02:27,685
- Some vacation.
- No, no, Roz. It is, actually.

53
00:02:27,847 --> 00:02:30,520
You see, every year, we pick a book
to read and discuss.

54

It's... It's been sort of a bonding thing
between us.

And, gosh, you know, I hate to brag,

but Freddie
really is a very articulate young man.

He's very imaginative, not to mention
what a great sense of humour he has.

Oh, oh, oh!

156
00:07:20,407 --> 00:07:23,160
Yes, yes, Niles.
I'll let you get the next one.

157
00:07:23,327 --> 00:07:25,761
- Freddie, any thoughts?
- No.

158
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:28,004
- Niles?
- It's <i>Walden</i> by Henry David Thoreau.

159
00:07:28,167 --> 00:07:30,681
Of course it is.

160
00:07:30,847 --> 00:07:33,964
"It is life near the bone
where it is sweetest."

161
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:37,524
Should be the source of much
lively discussion, wouldn't you say?

162
00:07:37,687 --> 00:07:38,756
I don't know.

163
00:07:38,927 --> 00:07:42,397
Why don't you just talk about it
with Uncle Niles?

164
00:07:42,567 --> 00:07:43,761
Niles.

165
00:07:43,927 --> 00:07:46,441
Well, yes, if that's what you'd like.

166
00:07:46,607 --> 00:07:48,563
We'll discuss it together.

167
00:07:48,727 --> 00:07:52,276
"If the engine whistles, let it whistle
till it is hoarse for its pain."

168
00:07:52,447 --> 00:07:54,358
Oh, shut up, Niles.

169
00:08:00,047 --> 00:08:02,356
Hey, how was the computer expo?

170
00:08:02,527 --> 00:08:04,165
Okay.

171
00:08:04,807 --> 00:08:08,356
Freddie, why don't you tell Grandpa
about the new virtual reality...?

172
00:08:09,087 --> 00:08:10,918
And he's gone.

173
00:08:11,087 --> 00:08:14,204
- So did you have fun?
- Oh, yeah. It was a blast.

174
00:08:14,367 --> 00:08:16,483
He spent the entire time
trying to ditch me.

175
00:08:17,327 --> 00:08:18,840
You know...

176
00:08:19,567 --> 00:08:21,444
...I only get to see
Freddie a few times a year.

177
00:08:21,607 --> 00:08:23,086
Usually, we make the most of it.

178
00:08:23,247 --> 00:08:25,602
Now all he wants to do
is play that damn computer game.

179

MARTIN:
Well, you know, Fras,

180
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:29,559
he's not different
than you were at that age.

181
00:08:29,727 --> 00:08:31,843
Except instead of video screens
and electronics,

182
00:08:32,007 --> 00:08:33,679
you always had your head in books.

183
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:35,803
- That's entirely different, Dad.
- No, it isn't.

184
00:08:35,967 --> 00:08:37,559
We couldn't get you to do anything.

185
00:08:37,727 --> 00:08:39,763
You know, I remember
when you read that <i>Walden</i> book.

186
00:08:39,927 --> 00:08:41,804
It was on the family camping trip.

187
00:08:41,967 --> 00:08:43,844
So? Well, what better time
to read about nature?

188
00:08:44,007 --> 00:08:44,996
MARTIN:
That's just it.

189
00:08:45,167 --> 00:08:48,682
While you were in the cabin reading
about it, we were outside enjoying it.

190
00:08:50,287 --> 00:08:53,279
You'd rather read about something
than experience it firsthand.

191
00:08:56,527 --> 00:09:00,315
You know, my mentor remarked
on that very thing.

192
00:09:04,207 --> 00:09:05,720
Freddie.

193
00:09:06,847 --> 00:09:10,522
Freddie, I've made a decision.
We are going to the woods.

194
00:09:10,687 --> 00:09:12,643
- What for?
- We are going camping.

195
00:09:12,807 --> 00:09:15,082
- It'll be good for the both of us.
- But I don't want to.

196
00:09:15,247 --> 00:09:16,805
Too bad. It'll be fun.

197
00:09:16,967 --> 00:09:19,527
Fathers and sons
should do fun things together.

198
00:09:20,167 --> 00:09:21,998
You and Grandpa
don't do fun things together.

199
00:09:22,167 --> 00:09:24,203
Hey, leave me out of this.

200
00:09:24,727 --> 00:09:27,366
That's why he's coming along
as well.

201
00:09:28,247 --> 00:09:29,600
There will be no TV,

202
00:09:29,767 --> 00:09:32,679
there will be no electronics,
there will be no distractions.

203
00:09:32,847 --> 00:09:34,803
Just three generations of Cranes

204
00:09:34,967 --> 00:09:37,606
cooking over a fire
and sleeping under the stars.

205
00:09:37,767 --> 00:09:39,723
We leave at daybreak.

206
00:09:42,527 --> 00:09:44,961
Good work, Freddie.

207
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:53,682
Oh! What an idyllic spot.

208
00:09:53,847 --> 00:09:56,122
I'm already beginning to feel
like Thoreau.

209
00:09:56,287 --> 00:09:58,198
We can't sleep here.
This place bites.

210

It does not bite.

and sufficient
for its coarser and simpler wants."

Is that you talking
or that guy from <i>Where's Walden?</i>

214

Good one, Freddie.

Yes, you know,
the two of you may want to immortalise

217
00:10:15,887 --> 00:10:19,721
this good-natured raillery
in these journals that I bought for you.

218
00:10:19,887 --> 00:10:21,479
Thanks, but I wouldn't know
what to write.

219
00:10:21,647 --> 00:10:24,480
Well, Dad, you simply write down
your experiences.

220
00:10:24,647 --> 00:10:28,640
- I have to go to the bathroom.
- Freddie, l... I don't see a bathroom.

221

You're surrounded
by 50,000 acres of it.

Ha-ha! How quaintly rustic.

Yes, Frederick,
just pick a tree and make it your own.

224
00:10:39,127 --> 00:10:42,836
So, Dad,
I thought we might do an activity later.

225
00:10:43,007 --> 00:10:44,838
- What kind of activity?
- Oh, I don't know.

226
00:10:45,007 --> 00:10:48,602
Maybe press some leaves
or whittle a birdcall

227
00:10:48,767 --> 00:10:52,203
and see if we can lure some finches
to our sill.

Take it easy now, we wanna save
something for tomorrow.

Dad, could you please
be a little more supportive?

230
00:10:58,207 --> 00:11:00,596
I'd like to, but I tried to get you
to camp a million times

231
00:11:00,767 --> 00:11:02,359
and you had to wait
till playoffs are on.

00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:05,166
Dad, you can watch
the playoffs all year.

The kids at the next campsite
built a rope swing.

- Can I go over?
- Don't see why not.

Thanks.

236
00:11:12,927 --> 00:11:14,963

of something to write in this thing.

This is a bad idea. My hair's flat.

Never have a good date
when my hair is flat.

If it's flat after, that's a good date.

So, uh, where are you two going
for dinner?

I thought we'd try the Pergola.
They have a garden patio.

Unless you'd rather eat inside.

in the way.

306
00:14:37,687 --> 00:14:40,326
Well, you may go.

307
00:14:44,687 --> 00:14:46,006
So...

308
00:14:46,327 --> 00:14:48,795
...he's been camping before.

309
00:14:49,407 --> 00:14:50,965
Instead of this
being something special,

310
00:14:51,127 --> 00:14:52,924
it's just another thing
I've missed out on.

311
00:14:53,087 --> 00:14:55,555
This trip was a bust
from the get-go.

312
00:14:55,727 --> 00:14:57,957
We leave at daybreak.

313
00:14:59,447 --> 00:15:01,836
What's with you and daybreak?

314
00:15:03,567 --> 00:15:06,240
I'm gonna see if those kids have
a generous grandpa with a six-pack.

315
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:07,880
Sit.

316
00:15:19,007 --> 00:15:21,077
DAPHNE: I once dated a guy
who was so grabby,

317
00:15:21,247 --> 00:15:24,319
I jumped out of his car
while it was still moving.

318
00:15:24,487 --> 00:15:26,682
Did I ever tell you
about this jerk named Nick?

319
00:15:26,847 --> 00:15:28,166
I dated a Nick.

320
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:29,396
[DOORBELL RINGS]

321
00:15:29,567 --> 00:15:32,206
My Nick had a silent G
at the beginning of his name.

322
00:15:32,367 --> 00:15:33,561
He was Vietnamese.

323
00:15:36,167 --> 00:15:38,203
I wonder who this could be.

324
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:42,081
Oh, what an incredible surprise.

325
00:15:42,247 --> 00:15:43,362
It's Hans. Hans, come in.

326
00:15:43,527 --> 00:15:46,803
Roz, Daphne, this is Hans.
He's a doctor from my building.

327
00:15:46,967 --> 00:15:48,366
Nice to meet you.

328
00:15:48,527 --> 00:15:50,597
Hello, Hans. What brings you by?

329
00:15:50,767 --> 00:15:52,598
I'm a friend of Frasier.

330
00:15:52,887 --> 00:15:56,766
Uh, I was downstairs, so I thought
I'd pop by, see if he was in.

331
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:58,997
- Yeah, well, he's not.
- You could stay for a drink.

332
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:01,727
Why don't come here?
Sit next to Roz.

333
00:16:01,887 --> 00:16:04,037
Niles, help me fix those drinks,
will you?

334
00:16:04,207 --> 00:16:05,879
Yes, dear.

335
00:16:07,527 --> 00:16:10,883
Doctor my eye.
That's Ted, the moron from the deli.

336
00:16:12,927 --> 00:16:15,521
- Are you sure?
- Oh, stop it.

337
00:16:15,687 --> 00:16:18,724
You invited him over here for Roz.
She's in no mood to be trifled with.

338
00:16:18,887 --> 00:16:20,798
- Neither am I.
- I'm sorry. I was trying to help.

339
00:16:20,967 --> 00:16:23,117
Yeah, well, if you want to help,
get rid of him.

340
00:16:23,287 --> 00:16:25,005
Love you.

341
00:16:29,367 --> 00:16:30,925
Can you believe this, Daphne?

342
00:16:31,087 --> 00:16:33,840
Roz, I am so sorry.
This evening's been a disaster.

343
00:16:34,007 --> 00:16:35,486
No, I mean, things are looking up.

344
00:16:35,647 --> 00:16:38,366
Hans and I are really hitting it off.
Do you have any mints in here?

345
00:16:38,527 --> 00:16:40,757
- Try the cupboards.
- Thanks.

346
00:16:40,927 --> 00:16:43,725
I have a really good feeling
about Hans.

347
00:16:43,887 --> 00:16:44,922
He's very funny.

348
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:48,921
He just told me
he was chief doctor of Brainiactrics.

349
00:16:51,247 --> 00:16:53,841
- Where did he go?
- I gave him the boot. He's gone.

350
00:16:54,007 --> 00:16:56,965
- Who's gone?
- Hans. He had an emergency.

351
00:16:57,127 --> 00:16:59,800
- Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.
- Oh, Roz...

352
00:16:59,967 --> 00:17:01,878
I thought this one liked me.

353
00:17:02,047 --> 00:17:04,356
Man, I've driven away two doctors
in one night.

354
00:17:04,527 --> 00:17:08,042
No, Hans is just the meat slicer
from the deli.

355
00:17:09,127 --> 00:17:11,800
And that's supposed
to make me feel better?

356
00:17:13,527 --> 00:17:16,644
Oh, God, I just wanna put
this whole night behind me.

357
00:17:16,807 --> 00:17:18,001
I don't blame you one bit.

358
00:17:18,167 --> 00:17:20,044
I'm sure it will all look better
in the morning.

359
00:17:20,207 --> 00:17:21,242
I sure hope so.

360
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:24,638
You two have listened to enough
of my problems for one night.

361
00:17:28,167 --> 00:17:31,000
Oh, look, <i>Titanic</i> just started.

362
00:17:37,527 --> 00:17:42,282
When you hear that scratching
at your window late at night,

363
00:17:42,447 --> 00:17:48,317
remember that young couple
and Fork Hand.

364
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:56,319
Oh, come on, that's scary stuff.

365
00:17:56,487 --> 00:17:59,957
I told that to Duke last summer
and he wet his sleeping bag.

366
00:18:01,167 --> 00:18:04,762
Wait a minute.
Isn't this Duke's sleeping bag?

367
00:18:05,647 --> 00:18:07,842
- Now you're scared.
- Ha-ha.

368
00:18:10,407 --> 00:18:12,443
Oh, gosh, Dad.

369
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:15,201
I'm sorry I snapped at you earlier.

370
00:18:15,407 --> 00:18:19,366
You know, I guess I was just hoping
this trip might give me and Frederick

371
00:18:19,527 --> 00:18:24,726
some sort of,
I don't know, golden moment.

372
00:18:26,047 --> 00:18:29,039
- I guess I'm just disappointed.
- I know.

373
00:18:29,807 --> 00:18:33,686
But you know, none of this
would be happening if we had a TV.

374
00:18:34,207 --> 00:18:37,404
TV makes everyone get along.

375
00:18:39,127 --> 00:18:41,197
MARTIN: Oh, hey, buddy.
FRASIER: Hi, Fred.

376
00:18:41,367 --> 00:18:44,962
- Well, I'll just take a little walk.
FRASIER: All right.

377
00:18:45,127 --> 00:18:47,038
- See you in a bit, Dad.
MARTIN: All right.

378
00:18:47,847 --> 00:18:50,998
Frederick, we're gonna be leaving
in the morning.

379
00:18:51,167 --> 00:18:52,725
But I don't wanna go.

380
00:18:52,887 --> 00:18:55,640
No? I thought you'd be
dying to get back to your Game Boy.

381
00:18:55,807 --> 00:18:59,004
Well, yeah, but I kind of made plans.

382
00:18:59,167 --> 00:19:01,078
Oh, really? With who?

383
00:19:01,527 --> 00:19:03,722
- Nobody.
- Oh, then, you don't have plans.

384
00:19:03,887 --> 00:19:07,675
We leave at... Nine-ish.

385
00:19:09,407 --> 00:19:11,967
Okay, fine.
I have plans with Melody.

386
00:19:13,047 --> 00:19:15,607
- The S'mores girl?
- Yeah.

387
00:19:16,207 --> 00:19:17,560
She's cute.

388
00:19:17,727 --> 00:19:19,160
She's a cheerleader.

389
00:19:19,367 --> 00:19:21,005
Ho-ho!

390
00:19:21,887 --> 00:19:25,800
I remember a particular cheerleader
from my youth.

391
00:19:25,967 --> 00:19:29,721
Lorna. She was a beautiful girl.

392
00:19:29,887 --> 00:19:31,320
In fact, I was so intimidated by her,

393
00:19:31,487 --> 00:19:33,876
I could never even work up
the courage to approach her.

394
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:35,560
- Dad.
- Damn it.

395
00:19:35,727 --> 00:19:36,921
I kissed her.

396
00:19:38,807 --> 00:19:40,160
Oh.

397
00:19:40,327 --> 00:19:43,842
I know. It was her first time.

398
00:19:46,687 --> 00:19:48,484
It was my first time too.

399
00:19:49,367 --> 00:19:50,800
I see.

400
00:19:50,967 --> 00:19:54,516
Don't tell Mom about this, okay?
She'd ask all kinds of stupid questions.

401
00:19:54,687 --> 00:19:58,475
Don't worry, son.
It's just between you and me.

402
00:19:59,647 --> 00:20:02,081
You know,
I think I'll write for a while before bed.

403
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:10,924
Whoa. Did you see the stuff
that Grandpa wrote about you?

404
00:20:11,087 --> 00:20:12,600
Give me that.
