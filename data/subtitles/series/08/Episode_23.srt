7
00:00:24,047 --> 00:00:26,242
It's awfully difficult
finding someone, though.

There was an honour guard,
the colonel's butler seating people.

00:01:57,767 --> 00:02:00,520
- Two archbishops presiding...
- Did you just say butler?

44
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:03,997
Oh, yes, I know.
An honest-to-goodness English butler.

45
00:02:04,167 --> 00:02:05,680
The colonel was a bit
of an anachronism.

46
00:02:05,847 --> 00:02:08,156
Oh, yes. It's amusing, really.

47
00:02:08,327 --> 00:02:10,522
I suppose this butler
saw to the colonel's every need.

48
00:02:10,727 --> 00:02:13,241
Oh, yeah, and clipped his cigars,
poured his scotch.

49

Laid out his clothes for him
and served him his meals.

- You had a gardener and maid.

but if my straw poll is any indication,

308
00:15:38,767 --> 00:15:41,156
we may be seeing you
at the next board meeting.

309
00:15:41,367 --> 00:15:45,201
Oh, well, I hope you don't think
that's why I did this.

310
00:15:45,367 --> 00:15:47,597
But it's certainly
a nice fringe benefit.

311
00:15:47,807 --> 00:15:51,561
I'm no farmer, Crane,
but I can smell manure a mile away.

312
00:15:52,407 --> 00:15:54,762
You'll be a welcome addition.

313
00:15:56,447 --> 00:15:57,926
Oh, Ferguson. Ferguson, listen.

314
00:15:58,127 --> 00:15:59,719
Make sure
that everyone has a champagne.

315
00:15:59,887 --> 00:16:03,436
I have a little toast in mind
that I daresay will seal the deal.

316
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:09,323
By the by, don't make any plans
for New Year's Eve.

317
00:16:09,487 --> 00:16:12,001
Lo and I are having a blowout
at our Mercer Island place.

318
00:16:12,167 --> 00:16:14,123
Well, that's a very generous offer,
but...

319
00:16:14,287 --> 00:16:15,356
Oh, we'd love to.

320
00:16:16,327 --> 00:16:18,238
It'll give me a chance to wear
that new Valentino

321
00:16:18,407 --> 00:16:20,762
- I might be getting for Christmas.
- Miss Moon?

322
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,877
Mel, may I see you for a moment?

323
00:16:24,047 --> 00:16:25,480
- Well, actually, l...
- No, thank you.

324
00:16:25,647 --> 00:16:27,478
Excuse us.
Excuse us just one second.

325
00:16:28,607 --> 00:16:30,518
New Year's Eve with you?
Are you out of your mind?

326
00:16:30,687 --> 00:16:31,722
Keep your voice down.

327
00:16:31,887 --> 00:16:34,321
Look, I have gone along
with this charade because I hurt you,

328
00:16:34,487 --> 00:16:36,557
but now you're just dragging it out
to be vindictive.

329
00:16:36,727 --> 00:16:40,003
- I'm not gonna tolerate it any longer.
- What're you gonna do about it?

330
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:42,681
- Keep pushing me, you'll find out.
- Don't threaten me.

331
00:16:42,887 --> 00:16:45,765
You made a promise,
and you're going to keep it.

332
00:16:45,967 --> 00:16:48,481
Your wrap, madam.
Dr. Crane thanks you for coming.

333
00:16:48,647 --> 00:16:51,161
Ferguson, Ferguson,
what in blue blazes are you doing?

334
00:16:51,367 --> 00:16:53,119
Perhaps to spare you
some embarrassment, sir,

335
00:16:53,287 --> 00:16:54,845
- I took the liberty...
- Stop.

336
00:16:55,007 --> 00:16:58,363
You've been taking far too much liberty
with the liberty-taking. Please.

337
00:16:58,567 --> 00:17:00,159
Just see that everyone
has some champagne.

338
00:17:00,327 --> 00:17:01,601
Yes, sir.

339
00:17:01,767 --> 00:17:04,406
There's no need to leave.
I would like to propose a toast.

340
00:17:04,567 --> 00:17:07,206
NILES: No, Mel, why don't you listen
for once? I'm through.

341
00:17:07,367 --> 00:17:09,676
MEL: I'll tell you when
you're through, you spineless twit,

342
00:17:09,847 --> 00:17:11,075
and you're not even close!

343
00:17:11,287 --> 00:17:13,881
Opera time! Opera time!

344
00:17:14,327 --> 00:17:15,601
On to the show.

345
00:17:16,407 --> 00:17:17,965
That's it, Mel.
I'm sick of these games.

346
00:17:18,127 --> 00:17:20,436
- Niles, don't make a scene.
- I don't care.

347
00:17:20,607 --> 00:17:23,724
I love Daphne and I'm not putting her
through this torture another second.

348
00:17:23,927 --> 00:17:26,395
This sham of a marriage is over.

349
00:17:30,487 --> 00:17:34,116
It's all right, dear. We've known
for some time he doesn't deserve you.

350
00:17:34,287 --> 00:17:36,721
Well, you've seen
what I have to put up with.

351
00:17:36,927 --> 00:17:38,645
I've tried so hard. I really have.

352
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:40,923
I don't know how you've put up
with him this long.

353
00:17:41,127 --> 00:17:42,401
- I just want out.
- Don't worry.

354
00:17:42,567 --> 00:17:44,558
I'll handle the divorce papers
personally.

355
00:17:44,727 --> 00:17:47,719
This jackass will be out of your life
by the end of the week.

356
00:17:47,927 --> 00:17:49,440
You mean it?

357
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:52,326
See you around, Crane.

358
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:57,523
I love you too.

359
00:18:00,847 --> 00:18:02,997
Oh, come on, Frasier,
you don't wanna spend the evening

360
00:18:03,167 --> 00:18:04,236
with those snobs anyway.

361
00:18:04,407 --> 00:18:05,396
Yeah.

362
00:18:05,567 --> 00:18:08,957
- Coming, Roz?
- Yeah, I'll be right there.

363
00:18:11,447 --> 00:18:14,644
I'm just getting an early start
on the candy drive.

364
00:18:16,607 --> 00:18:20,202
Frasier, I'm sorry
I ruined your evening.

365
00:18:20,407 --> 00:18:22,079
That's all right, Niles.

366
00:18:22,247 --> 00:18:25,205
It's a small price to pay
to finally see you and Daphne together.

367
00:18:25,367 --> 00:18:29,406
It's true. We're free. No more hiding.

368
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:34,516
Where do you wanna go?
Dinner? Dancing? London? Paris?

369
00:18:34,727 --> 00:18:36,399
Why don't we go for a walk?

370
00:18:37,287 --> 00:18:40,723
- Even better.
FERGUSON: If you'll allow me.

371
00:18:41,727 --> 00:18:44,764
- Thank you, Ferguson.
FERGUSON: My pleasure, sir.

372
00:18:48,407 --> 00:18:52,161
- Thank you, Ferguson.
- It was my privilege, Ms. Moon.

373
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:02,839
All right, Ferguson, we've got
some fences to mend with the board.

374
00:19:05,407 --> 00:19:07,477
What do we send,
and to whom do we send it?

375
00:19:07,687 --> 00:19:11,726
Actually, sir, I regret to inform you
that I must tender my resignation.

376
00:19:11,887 --> 00:19:14,117
Please, don't be upset
things didn't go well this evening.

377
00:19:14,287 --> 00:19:16,881
I'll make it up to you.
Send yourself something.

378
00:19:20,287 --> 00:19:23,324
Thank you, sir, but it's not you.

379
00:19:23,487 --> 00:19:25,205
It was your brother and Ms. Moon.

380
00:19:27,007 --> 00:19:30,636
His willingness
to break social rank has inspired me.

381
00:19:30,807 --> 00:19:36,120
And there' a certain Lady Westerfield
whose acquaintance I'd like to renew.

382
00:19:36,287 --> 00:19:39,438
Ah. True love and all that.

383
00:19:39,607 --> 00:19:43,156
Well, good luck, Ferguson.

384
00:19:43,367 --> 00:19:44,402
Thank you, sir.

385
00:19:44,567 --> 00:19:48,924
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I had rather a difficult evening.

386
00:19:49,087 --> 00:19:52,796
Think I'll just go take a sad soak
in the tub.

387
00:19:53,647 --> 00:19:59,119
Sir, after such an evening, it's not right
for a man to draw his own bath,

388
00:19:59,287 --> 00:20:03,121
so if I may take the liberty...

389
00:20:04,887 --> 00:20:07,037
Carry on, Ferguson.
