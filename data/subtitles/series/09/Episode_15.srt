1
00:00:07,887 --> 00:00:09,115
So just remember,

2
00:00:09,287 --> 00:00:11,517
when you're standing there
out on the...

3
00:00:11,687 --> 00:00:13,678
Why hasn't Frasier
mentioned the Spokane thing yet?

4
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:16,236
I don't know. I'm sure we'll get to it
by the end of the show.

5
00:00:16,407 --> 00:00:18,967
Well, he better. Because I left him
a memo and an e-mail

6
00:00:19,127 --> 00:00:21,800
specifically asking him
to promote this Spokane thing.

7
00:00:21,967 --> 00:00:25,403
Now, ignoring an e-mail's one thing,
but a memo and an e-mail?

8
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:29,276
I may have to bring the hammer down
and leave a Post-it on his desk.

9
00:00:29,727 --> 00:00:32,480
Which brings me to a bit of news.

10
00:00:32,647 --> 00:00:36,162
Monday, there will be a new addition
to the Frasier Crane radio family.

11
00:00:36,327 --> 00:00:38,363
The city of Spokane.

12
00:00:38,527 --> 00:00:40,165
Ooh, thank goodness.

13
00:00:40,327 --> 00:00:43,797
Man, that was like the Cuban Missile
Crisis for a moment, wasn't it?

14
00:00:44,247 --> 00:00:47,364
In fact, KQZY is not only
going to be carrying the show,

15
00:00:47,527 --> 00:00:50,325
but they've invited Roz and me
to conduct Monday's broadcast

16
00:00:50,487 --> 00:00:52,637
from their studios in Spokane.

17
00:00:52,807 --> 00:00:55,275
But fret not, Seattle.

18
00:00:55,447 --> 00:00:57,961
Although my body
will be 300 miles away,

19
00:00:58,127 --> 00:01:02,882
my heart will be firmly lodged
in your radios.

20
00:01:04,127 --> 00:01:06,800
You know, that sounded a lot better
this morning in the shower.

21
00:01:06,967 --> 00:01:09,276
Anyway, good day
and good mental health.

22
00:01:09,727 --> 00:01:13,402
- I thought Friday was your bath day.
- Well, I woke up late.

23
00:01:13,567 --> 00:01:15,683
What time do you want me
to pick up you and Roger?

24
00:01:15,847 --> 00:01:18,998
Ooh, there's been a change in plans.
Roger is not coming to Spokane.

25
00:01:19,167 --> 00:01:21,203
Really? Well, nothing wrong,
I hope.

26
00:01:21,367 --> 00:01:23,005
We broke up.

27
00:01:23,167 --> 00:01:25,761
Oh, Roz, I'm so sorry.

28
00:01:26,207 --> 00:01:27,959
We talked about some problems
we'd been having

29
00:01:28,127 --> 00:01:30,357
and decided, you know,
we'd be better off apart.

30
00:01:30,527 --> 00:01:31,960
- When did this happen?
- Last week.

31
00:01:32,127 --> 00:01:33,446
- Last week?
- I didn't tell you,

32
00:01:33,607 --> 00:01:36,565
because I didn't want to have
a long conversation.

33
00:01:37,687 --> 00:01:39,564
I understand.

34
00:01:39,727 --> 00:01:42,321
You must be going through a lot.
Back in private practise,

35
00:01:42,487 --> 00:01:45,957
- I used to tell my Grief group that...
- See, this is exactly what I mean.

36
00:01:46,847 --> 00:01:49,520
I appreciate your concern,
but I am fine.

37
00:01:49,687 --> 00:01:50,915
Really.

38
00:01:51,087 --> 00:01:52,281
Okay.

39
00:01:53,487 --> 00:01:55,637
Boy, what a surprise.

40
00:01:55,807 --> 00:01:57,479
- No more Roger.
- I know.

41
00:01:57,647 --> 00:02:01,117
Yes. He had a rare kind of dignity

44
00:02:07,447 --> 00:02:11,838
I don't believe I've ever met anyone
with that combination of gentility

45
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:13,281
and brute strength.

46
00:02:13,447 --> 00:02:14,436
Well, not anybody single.

47
00:02:14,607 --> 00:02:15,642
[LAUGHS]

48
00:02:16,367 --> 00:02:18,562
- I'm not helping, am I?
- No.

49
00:02:24,847 --> 00:02:27,156
Niles, I thought you and Daphne
were going out tonight.

50
00:02:27,327 --> 00:02:30,285
She's still getting ready. Hey, Frasier,
am I dressed appropriately

51
00:02:30,447 --> 00:02:33,007
for something called Bananarama?

52
00:02:34,367 --> 00:02:36,517
You're in Armani.
Who could object?

53
00:02:38,327 --> 00:02:39,396
- Hey, guys.
FRASIER: Dad.

54
00:02:39,567 --> 00:02:41,762
Uh, just lean it up
against the window there, will you?

55
00:02:41,927 --> 00:02:43,918
- What is this?
- It's mahogany.

56
00:02:44,087 --> 00:02:47,796
Real straight grain too. I found it
outside the construction site next door.

57
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:49,400
They were gonna throw it away.

58
00:02:49,567 --> 00:02:51,125
Dad, I thought
we had this discussion

59
00:02:51,287 --> 00:02:54,677
when you found that mattress
on the side of the highway.

60
00:02:54,847 --> 00:02:57,884
But this isn't for resale.
I'm gonna make a TV table out of it.

61
00:02:58,047 --> 00:03:00,356
Thanks, fellas. Isn't it a beaut?

62
00:03:00,527 --> 00:03:02,757
There's a ketchup packet stuck to it.

63
00:03:03,967 --> 00:03:07,596
Oh, it's gonna feel good
to break out the tools,

64
00:03:07,767 --> 00:03:09,405
roll up my sleeves

65
00:03:09,567 --> 00:03:11,205
and make something
with my own two hands.

66
00:03:11,367 --> 00:03:12,641
FRASIER:
Are you sure this is a good idea?

67
00:03:12,807 --> 00:03:14,798
Woodworking has never really been
your strength.

68
00:03:14,967 --> 00:03:17,162
Yeah. I think the scariest words
of my childhood were:

69
00:03:17,327 --> 00:03:19,795
"Your father needs your help
down in the basement."

70
00:03:21,207 --> 00:03:24,119
I must have done something right.
I made a lot of good stuff.

71
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:26,482
Even with directions,
you could never assemble anything.

72
00:03:26,647 --> 00:03:32,005
I remember a playset where the slide
ended right in front of the swings.

73
00:03:33,687 --> 00:03:37,157
- I don't remember that.
- I know. Sorry.

74
00:03:38,527 --> 00:03:42,315
Now, I'm gonna build a TV table,
and I need a number one helper.

75
00:03:42,487 --> 00:03:45,047
- Whose turn is it?
- No, no. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

76
00:03:45,207 --> 00:03:48,040
I am leaving for Spokane on Sunday.
I will not be available.

77
00:03:48,207 --> 00:03:51,040
- Your show's not till Monday.
- Yes, well, I have sponsors to meet.

78
00:03:51,207 --> 00:03:53,960
I have press interviews
and photo sessions.

79
00:03:54,127 --> 00:03:56,004
Niles, this is a very big step
in my career.

80
00:03:56,167 --> 00:03:58,283
If I can prove that my brand of radio
travels well,

81
00:03:58,447 --> 00:04:02,440
perhaps I can parlay Spokane
into Denver, Chicago.

82
00:04:02,607 --> 00:04:04,837
Maybe even New York City.

83
00:04:05,007 --> 00:04:07,840
- Well, you win, buddy.
- Oh.

84
00:04:08,007 --> 00:04:09,645
I'll see you tomorrow.

85
00:04:09,807 --> 00:04:13,038
Be sure to wear some work gloves.
Oh, and some coveralls.

86
00:04:13,207 --> 00:04:17,359
We don't want a repeat of that
necktie-in-the-bandsaw incident.

87
00:04:18,447 --> 00:04:20,039
Oh, great. With my luck,

88
00:04:20,207 --> 00:04:23,085
there'll be a baseball game
on the radio too.

89
00:04:23,247 --> 00:04:24,600
It won't be so bad.

90
00:04:25,127 --> 00:04:26,116
How can you say that?

91
00:04:26,287 --> 00:04:29,279
You once tried to report him
to the Child Labor Board.

92
00:04:29,447 --> 00:04:33,122
I was being proactive. You used to
lock yourself in the bathroom to cry.

93
00:04:33,767 --> 00:04:37,237
I didn't go in there to cry.
I went in to regather my patience.

94
00:04:38,927 --> 00:04:41,646
Say, Niles, why don't you ask Daphne
to fill in for you?

95
00:04:41,807 --> 00:04:43,160
- Daphne?
- Well, why not?

96
00:04:43,327 --> 00:04:46,205
She's gonna owe you big-time
after this banana event.

97
00:04:46,367 --> 00:04:48,722
No, no, it's a concert.
And I hardly think it compares

98
00:04:48,887 --> 00:04:50,843
to the torture of assisting Dad.

99
00:04:51,767 --> 00:04:54,042
All right, I'm ready.

100
00:04:55,327 --> 00:04:57,477
Oh, Niles, you're not going
in those clothes.

101
00:04:57,647 --> 00:05:01,003
Come with me. I got you some hair gel
and parachute pants.

102
00:05:07,047 --> 00:05:10,084
HERM:
Okay, here's the drill.

103
00:05:10,247 --> 00:05:11,965
I'll introduce you to the reporters,

104
00:05:12,127 --> 00:05:14,595
they'll ask you questions,
try not to go on too much.

105
00:05:14,767 --> 00:05:17,235
The faster we get them
to the courtesy liquor, the better.

106
00:05:17,407 --> 00:05:18,999
Oh, don't worry, Herm.

107
00:05:19,167 --> 00:05:21,556
I'll get my message across.
You see, I'm a bit of a puppeteer

108
00:05:21,727 --> 00:05:23,046
when it comes to the press.

109
00:05:23,207 --> 00:05:24,640
Good.

110
00:05:24,807 --> 00:05:26,923
But still, liquor.

111
00:05:28,967 --> 00:05:30,082
Oh, sorry I'm late, doc.

112
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:32,124
I, uh, had a situation at the hotel,

113
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:33,402
but it's under control now.

114
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:37,480
Judging from the pillow wrinkles
on your cheek, it was a nap situation.

115
00:05:38,487 --> 00:05:40,842
- Point is, it's under control.
- Ah.

116
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:43,680
Kenny Daly.
Don't say hi or anything?

117
00:05:43,847 --> 00:05:45,485
Herm Evans.

118
00:05:45,647 --> 00:05:47,399
So how's our star doing?

119
00:05:47,567 --> 00:05:49,444
- Everything go okay with the CPSs?
- Terrific.

120
00:05:49,607 --> 00:05:51,404
- And your ExecComm?
- Oh, they're thrilled.

121
00:05:51,567 --> 00:05:54,320
- What about the M&M's?
- Help yourself.

122
00:05:56,287 --> 00:05:57,959
- Hey, everybody.
- Hey, Roz.

123
00:05:58,127 --> 00:06:00,482
Let me introduce you to Herm Evans,
the station manager.

124
00:06:00,647 --> 00:06:02,000
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you, Roz.

125
00:06:02,167 --> 00:06:03,759
- Thank you.
- Now that everybody's here,

126
00:06:03,927 --> 00:06:06,395
- I'll go get the reporters.
- Right, right.

127
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:09,320
Uh, Roz, listen,
sure you're up to this?

128
00:06:09,487 --> 00:06:10,806
Yeah, why? Why wouldn't I be?

129
00:06:10,967 --> 00:06:14,198
Well, it's been a tough time lately,
you know, with the Roger situation.

130
00:06:14,367 --> 00:06:16,437
Oh, knock it off, Frasier, I'm fine.

131
00:06:16,607 --> 00:06:17,642
- You're sure?
- Yes.

132
00:06:17,807 --> 00:06:19,525
I wouldn't blame you
if you were struggling.

133
00:06:19,687 --> 00:06:22,440
I mean, my head would be filled
with "what if"s and "if only"s and...

134
00:06:22,607 --> 00:06:24,438
Oh, God forbid,
the looming question:

135
00:06:24,607 --> 00:06:26,279
"What if I'll never again
have a chance...?"

136
00:06:26,447 --> 00:06:28,722
Ooh, here comes the press.
All right, big smiles.

137
00:06:29,487 --> 00:06:30,920
HERM:
Thanks for coming, everybody.

138
00:06:31,367 --> 00:06:35,042
Hey, Matt, is that a new tie
or did you just have it cleaned?

139
00:06:35,207 --> 00:06:36,196
[BOTH LAUGH]

140
00:06:37,607 --> 00:06:39,598
There'll be plenty of time
for that cheese plate

141
00:06:39,767 --> 00:06:44,079
after you've fallen in love
with KQZY's proud new addition,

142
00:06:44,247 --> 00:06:46,886
- Dr. Frasier Crane.
- Thank you.

143
00:06:47,047 --> 00:06:48,241
Thank you very much.

144
00:06:48,407 --> 00:06:50,443
I'd like to take this opportunity
to introduce

145
00:06:50,607 --> 00:06:54,077
my lovely producing partner,
Roz Doyle.

146
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:58,638
I'm looking forward to becoming part
of the radio landscape in Spokane.

147
00:06:58,807 --> 00:07:00,081
Dr. Crane, how do you feel

148
00:07:00,247 --> 00:07:02,807
about taking over
Neal Sullivan's time slot?

149
00:07:02,967 --> 00:07:04,195
- I'm sorry, who?
HERM: Nobody.

150
00:07:04,367 --> 00:07:05,561
It's a guy you're replacing.

151
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:09,037
Nobody? He's been
a Spokane institution for 30 years.

152
00:07:09,207 --> 00:07:11,118
HERM:
Yes, we all saw your column.

153
00:07:11,287 --> 00:07:13,118
You know what would make
another great column?

154
00:07:13,287 --> 00:07:18,361
Dr. Crane went to Harvard and Oxford.

00:14:32,047 --> 00:14:34,277
Perhaps this would be a good time
to go to a commercial

309
00:14:34,447 --> 00:14:37,962
here on the Frasier Crane
Radio Network.

310
00:14:38,567 --> 00:14:41,127
Hey, hey, you're doing great.

311
00:14:41,287 --> 00:14:42,606
I am not. They hate me.

312
00:14:42,767 --> 00:14:45,725
Okay, uh,
since we're being straight, um,

313
00:14:45,887 --> 00:14:48,196
Herm doesn't think it's going
very well.

314
00:14:48,367 --> 00:14:49,846
Yes, well, where's my support?

315
00:14:50,007 --> 00:14:51,406
Where are the callers from Seattle?

316
00:14:51,567 --> 00:14:53,046
Seattle isn't getting the signal.

317
00:14:53,207 --> 00:14:55,562
Something's obviously screwed up
at KACL.

318
00:14:55,727 --> 00:14:59,197
Oh, it's not KACL. It's that transmitter
you bought off the Ukrainian Internet.

319
00:14:59,367 --> 00:15:01,085
Hey, 20 minutes ago,
you were impressed

320
00:15:01,247 --> 00:15:03,238
with that Ukrainian Internet.

321
00:15:06,087 --> 00:15:07,998
I'm sure the people of Spokane
would get onboard

322
00:15:08,167 --> 00:15:11,762
if they could get some understanding
of what we actually do.

323
00:15:12,407 --> 00:15:14,762
We could use an example.

324
00:15:14,927 --> 00:15:16,724
Like a sample call.

325
00:15:16,887 --> 00:15:19,606
- Are you asking me to call in?
- Roz, please?

326
00:15:19,767 --> 00:15:21,439
Tell you what. Make up something.
Anything.

327
00:15:21,607 --> 00:15:23,006
Okay.

328
00:15:23,167 --> 00:15:25,044
Five seconds.

329
00:15:25,207 --> 00:15:27,118
Hello, and welcome back
to the <i>Frasier Crane Show.</i>

330
00:15:27,287 --> 00:15:30,245
We are broadcasting today
from KQZY

331
00:15:30,407 --> 00:15:32,204
in beautiful Spokane.

332
00:15:32,647 --> 00:15:34,956
Let's go to the phones.

333
00:15:35,127 --> 00:15:37,516
Hello, caller. I'm listening.

334
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:38,836
Hi, Dr. Crane.

335
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:41,760
My name is Roberta,

336
00:15:42,167 --> 00:15:46,126
and, um, I'm afraid of the dark.

337
00:15:51,647 --> 00:15:54,684
What is it about the dark
that frightens you?

338
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:56,879
Um...

339
00:15:58,047 --> 00:15:59,605
I don't really know.

340
00:16:02,807 --> 00:16:05,002
I see. All right, well, uh, let's explore.

341
00:16:07,047 --> 00:16:09,880
Often, a fear of darkness is

342
00:16:10,727 --> 00:16:12,558
a fear of the unknown.

343
00:16:12,727 --> 00:16:17,243
It is in darkness
when our imaginations give shape

344
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:20,285
to our deepest anxieties.

345
00:16:21,087 --> 00:16:23,396
What image comes to mind for you?

346
00:16:25,647 --> 00:16:27,239
Nothing, actually.

347
00:16:27,407 --> 00:16:29,079
Nothing?

348
00:16:29,567 --> 00:16:32,479
Yeah. When everything disappears,

349
00:16:32,647 --> 00:16:34,285
there's nothing.

350
00:16:34,447 --> 00:16:36,722
Just emptiness.

351
00:16:36,927 --> 00:16:38,360
I see.

352
00:16:38,527 --> 00:16:41,997
And what is it about the emptiness
that frightens you?

353
00:16:43,847 --> 00:16:45,360
It's...

354
00:16:46,047 --> 00:16:48,402
...lonely, for one thing.

355
00:16:48,847 --> 00:16:50,405
Have you always felt this way?

356
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:52,758
For a while, I didn't.

357
00:16:52,927 --> 00:16:54,599
What was different then?

358
00:16:56,687 --> 00:16:58,803
I had somebody.

359
00:17:00,407 --> 00:17:02,682
A guy I really liked.

360
00:17:03,327 --> 00:17:05,477
And then we broke up.

[SOBBING]

362
00:17:07,007 --> 00:17:11,046
God, Frasier, I miss him so much.

363
00:17:13,167 --> 00:17:16,239
I don't know how I fell in love again.

364
00:17:16,407 --> 00:17:18,557
I mean, I swore I wouldn't.

365
00:17:18,727 --> 00:17:19,762
I knew better.

366
00:17:19,927 --> 00:17:22,361
I should have known better.

367
00:17:22,887 --> 00:17:24,400
And then, sure enough,

368
00:17:24,567 --> 00:17:28,480
six months in, he tells me
there's no fireworks.

369
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:31,161
And what am I supposed to say?

370
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,923
I'm so sorry.

371
00:17:37,247 --> 00:17:39,283
But listen to me.

372
00:17:39,847 --> 00:17:43,476
You can't blame yourself
for letting someone into your heart.

373
00:17:44,847 --> 00:17:47,600
Love is always a risk.

374
00:17:47,927 --> 00:17:49,565
But you have to take it.

375
00:17:50,567 --> 00:17:53,684
The pain you're feeling now
will pass in time,

376
00:17:53,847 --> 00:17:57,283
and you'll find yourself ready
to take that risk again.

377
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:00,324
Until then,

378
00:18:00,647 --> 00:18:02,922
take comfort in your friends.

379
00:18:03,367 --> 00:18:05,198
They want to help you.

380
00:18:05,367 --> 00:18:06,766
They love you.

381
00:18:08,887 --> 00:18:10,605
Yeah, thanks.

382
00:18:11,087 --> 00:18:12,759
You're welcome.

these problems

I realise that an honest conversation
at this point

00:19:26,007 --> 00:19:27,998
may be a little daunting...
