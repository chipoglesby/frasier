You're so lucky to be musical.

6
00:00:27,127 --> 00:00:29,766
I'd give my right hand to be able
to play the piano the way you do.

7
00:00:29,927 --> 00:00:32,122
Hmm, sounds a bit like O. Henry
meets Stephen King.

8

But still, if you're serious,
I'd be willing to give you lessons.

9

10
00:00:36,727 --> 00:00:38,479

11

and my family would sing rugby songs
after my brothers' matches.

12

like "The Old She-Crab"

14

- This is quite an anniversary.

24

You weren't even with Lilith
for eight years.

25

Please, Niles,
I hardly think it's the same thing.

26
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:17,198
It's not that different.
If you were a woman,

27

by now.

DAPHNE: And think about this.

29

the perfect woman,

30
00:01:23,807 --> 00:01:26,844

nine years before you overtook him.

31
00:01:27,007 --> 00:01:29,362
Yes, and actually,
if you add the 18 years

- No, wait, Dad.

314
00:14:24,047 --> 00:14:26,322
Frasier just said something
very interesting to me...

315
00:14:26,487 --> 00:14:27,840
- Niles.
- I think you should hear.

316
00:14:28,007 --> 00:14:29,998
- Niles.
- Please, let me help you through this.

317
00:14:30,167 --> 00:14:32,362
Don't forget, I've done my share
of couples counselling.

318
00:14:32,527 --> 00:14:34,597
[SHOUTS]
We are not a couple!

319
00:14:34,767 --> 00:14:39,397
I'm sorry, I only meant
that I am an experienced mediator.

320
00:14:39,567 --> 00:14:43,162
Now, Frasier,
tell Dad what you were just telling me.

321
00:14:45,767 --> 00:14:47,325
All right.

322
00:14:49,727 --> 00:14:51,524
I think...

323
00:14:52,287 --> 00:14:54,721
...that anniversary talk...

324
00:14:55,607 --> 00:14:57,165
...stirred up some issues for me.

325
00:14:58,567 --> 00:15:03,595
That our relationship
is the only one I'll ever have.

326
00:15:04,127 --> 00:15:06,641
That for all intents and purposes,

327
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:10,399
you are my significant other.

328
00:15:12,567 --> 00:15:14,956
- And that's my fault?
- I didn't say it was your fault, Dad.

329
00:15:15,127 --> 00:15:18,005
You think it's a picnic living with you?
It's not exactly my dream either.

330
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:20,920
Okay, no, wait, wait, wait, honesty.
This is good.

331
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,043
I'm just saying
I've had a bit of a breakthrough.

332
00:15:23,207 --> 00:15:25,596
Dandy! You've had a breakthrough,
I've lost my chair.

333
00:15:25,767 --> 00:15:28,600
Maybe I could sit
on your breakthrough.

334
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:30,359
I'll tell you what you can sit on!

335
00:15:30,527 --> 00:15:33,564
Okay, okay, okay. Wait, wait, wait,
let's just keep this constructive.

336
00:15:33,727 --> 00:15:35,001
If you're going to make progress,

337
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:37,442
you're both going
to have to compromise.

338
00:15:37,607 --> 00:15:40,121
Now, which one of you is willing
to take the first step?

339
00:15:44,607 --> 00:15:46,279
Allow me.

340
00:15:52,927 --> 00:15:55,122
You do this for a living, do you?

341
00:15:55,727 --> 00:15:59,515
[SHOUTS] I do it
because I enjoy working with people!

342
00:16:02,567 --> 00:16:05,639
Niles, I've been thinking. Maybe you
and Roz should continue without me.

343
00:16:05,807 --> 00:16:07,763
- Why would we do that?
- Because she's good.

344
00:16:07,927 --> 00:16:10,077
- Just a second...
- No, no, no, don't worry about me.

345
00:16:10,247 --> 00:16:13,398
I'll find something easier to play,
like a stick.

346
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:17,125
Daphne, I'm not gonna let you quit.

347
00:16:17,287 --> 00:16:18,606
You're just a slow starter.

348
00:16:18,767 --> 00:16:21,327
It may require a little more time
but you'll improve.

349
00:16:21,487 --> 00:16:24,285
- You really think so?
- You have to trust me.

350
00:16:24,447 --> 00:16:25,675
I don't care how long it takes.

351
00:16:25,847 --> 00:16:28,077
I am going
to make a pianist out of you.

352
00:16:28,247 --> 00:16:30,158
Thank you.

353
00:16:30,327 --> 00:16:33,000
You know, you're much nicer
than my old piano teacher.

354
00:16:35,567 --> 00:16:38,365
- You took lessons before?
- Hmm? Oh, yeah.

355
00:16:38,527 --> 00:16:40,836
Eight years of them.

356
00:16:43,367 --> 00:16:44,800
Mr. Cruikshank.

357
00:16:44,967 --> 00:16:47,083
You know, he once played
at the Royal Albert Hall.

358
00:16:47,247 --> 00:16:49,636
Oh, why did you stop
taking the lessons, honey?

359
00:16:49,807 --> 00:16:53,595
Well, it turns out Mr. Cruikshank
was an unstable man.

360
00:16:53,767 --> 00:16:56,600
He took his own life.

361
00:16:58,287 --> 00:17:01,484
Do you know I was the last person
to see him alive?

362
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:06,837
Dad, Frasier's here.

363
00:17:09,967 --> 00:17:11,446
What's this?

364
00:17:11,607 --> 00:17:16,806
It's something I got to tell you
I'm sorry for being such a sorehead.

365
00:17:18,247 --> 00:17:20,158
Oh, Dad.

366
00:17:20,327 --> 00:17:21,396
I'm overwhelmed.

367
00:17:21,567 --> 00:17:23,205
Tied the bow myself.

368
00:17:23,367 --> 00:17:25,403
Just... Just pull on it.
It'll come right off.

369
00:17:25,567 --> 00:17:26,716
Yeah? All right.

370
00:17:33,527 --> 00:17:37,156
Oh, how... How unexpected.

371
00:17:37,327 --> 00:17:38,680
You don't like it.

372
00:17:38,847 --> 00:17:42,726
- No, no, I do. It, it's just that...
- I got some guy, Eduardo, to help me.

373
00:17:42,887 --> 00:17:44,639
I figured I couldn't miss.

374
00:17:45,287 --> 00:17:46,800
It's divine.

375
00:17:46,967 --> 00:17:49,197
That's what Eduardo said.

376
00:17:51,847 --> 00:17:54,884
There's just one problem.

377
00:17:55,047 --> 00:17:56,082
If you don't like it...

378
00:17:56,247 --> 00:17:59,319
I know, I can set it on fire
and throw it over the balcony.

379
00:18:00,047 --> 00:18:01,480
No,
I just meant you can take it back.

380
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:02,716
I want you to be happy.

381
00:18:02,887 --> 00:18:04,923
Frasier, this is a wonderful gesture
on Dad's part.

382
00:18:05,087 --> 00:18:07,476
I do too, Niles. I do.
I'm... I'm very touched, Dad.

383
00:18:07,647 --> 00:18:09,558
Thank you. Thank you so much.

384
00:18:11,647 --> 00:18:15,606
It's just that I had something else
in mind. Uh...

385
00:18:15,767 --> 00:18:17,246
[DOORBELL RINGS]

386
00:18:17,767 --> 00:18:19,678
Well, I give up.
Try to do a nice thing...

387
00:18:19,847 --> 00:18:21,326
- What's the matter?
FRASIER: Just...

388
00:18:22,007 --> 00:18:23,884
Ah, good.
Gentlemen, come right in, please.

389
00:18:24,047 --> 00:18:27,642
Uh, just set it right over here.

390
00:18:27,807 --> 00:18:30,116
You bought a chair?
Thanks for telling me.

391
00:18:30,287 --> 00:18:32,562
Give me a chance.
I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.

392
00:18:32,727 --> 00:18:34,797
- I need somebody to sign for this.
- Yes, of course.

393
00:18:34,967 --> 00:18:37,083
In just a moment, please.
Could you wait at the door?

394
00:18:37,247 --> 00:18:38,475
Thank you.

395
00:18:38,647 --> 00:18:42,640
Everyone, I would like to introduce you
to the newest member

396
00:18:42,807 --> 00:18:45,844
of our furniture family.

397
00:18:49,887 --> 00:18:51,684
Where did you find this?

398
00:18:51,847 --> 00:18:54,281
You can't find that, Dad.
It doesn't exist anymore...

399
00:18:56,767 --> 00:18:58,837
...which is why I contacted
a master builder,

400
00:18:59,007 --> 00:19:01,567
showed him some photographs
and had him duplicate it.

401
00:19:01,727 --> 00:19:04,605
As for the material, I tracked down
the original manufacturer

402
00:19:04,767 --> 00:19:08,362
and once I got them to admit
they made it, I had them reweave it.

403
00:19:09,887 --> 00:19:12,276
- It must have cost a fortune.
FRASIER: Yes.

404
00:19:12,447 --> 00:19:15,359
Ironically, this is now
the most expensive piece of furniture

405
00:19:15,527 --> 00:19:17,483
in the entire apartment.

406
00:19:17,647 --> 00:19:20,445
Oh, it's beautiful! Thank you, son.

407
00:19:20,607 --> 00:19:23,246
Well done, Frasier.
Oh, it feels just the same.

408
00:19:23,407 --> 00:19:24,396
I don't want to get up.

409
00:19:24,567 --> 00:19:27,479
Well, that's a shame. I was planning
on taking us both out to dinner, Dad.

410
00:19:27,647 --> 00:19:29,399
- Anywhere you'd like.
- Even the steak house?

411
00:19:29,567 --> 00:19:32,081
Even the steak house.

412
00:19:32,247 --> 00:19:33,839
Niles, Daphne,
you're welcome to join us.

413
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:35,884
Oh, sorry
but we're in the middle of my piano...

414
00:19:36,047 --> 00:19:37,799
We'd love to.

415
00:19:39,447 --> 00:19:43,599
You know, I'll bet we can get free pie
if we just tell them it's our anniversary.
