You booted her car.

Oh, yeah, I remember
having a car booted earlier.

It was parked kind of close
to a hydrant. Was that hers?

Now, that's a lot of trouble.

was getting four guys to pick it up

- What the hell is throat-singing?
- Well.

186
00:09:14,567 --> 00:09:16,125
Dad, it's an extraordinary technique

187
00:09:16,327 --> 00:09:19,080
where a single vocalist can produce
two distinct tones simultaneously,

188
00:09:19,247 --> 00:09:22,205
allowing him
to harmonize with himself.

189
00:09:22,407 --> 00:09:24,796
Kind of like the Everly Brothers.

and came from Mongolia, yes.

00:15:08,607 --> 00:15:10,518
That's what I'm gonna do.
I'll do it tonight.

309
00:15:10,727 --> 00:15:13,195
Good for you, Marty.
Hey, can we stop?

310
00:15:13,367 --> 00:15:15,927
- I need to get another Slushee.
- You just got that one.

311
00:15:16,127 --> 00:15:17,526
I got rinds in it.

312
00:15:17,727 --> 00:15:21,606
All right, but I'll go in and get it.
You stay here and clean this mess up.

313
00:15:33,407 --> 00:15:35,045
Good news, Dad. We worked it out.

314
00:15:35,247 --> 00:15:37,078
- You did?
- Yes. Listen, Dad, I'm sorry.

315
00:15:37,287 --> 00:15:39,357
I hope our little tiff
didn't spoil the occasion.

316
00:15:39,527 --> 00:15:41,518
We're all so proud of you.
I want you to know that.

317
00:15:41,687 --> 00:15:43,166
Thanks, son.
So who's walking Eddie?

318
00:15:43,327 --> 00:15:44,396
I am.

319
00:15:44,607 --> 00:15:46,643
If I take him now,
I have time to make the concert,

320
00:15:46,807 --> 00:15:48,399
and he'll be okay
until they come back.

321
00:15:48,607 --> 00:15:50,359
I told you,
he's gotta be walked around 10:00.

322
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,676
That's his routine.

323
00:15:51,887 --> 00:15:53,923
Well, can't his routine
just bend a little?

324
00:15:54,127 --> 00:15:57,676
Fine. Then I hope your Berber carpet
is waterproof.

325
00:15:57,847 --> 00:16:00,520
- Hey, hey, what's wrong?
- Apparently his nibs will explode

326
00:16:00,687 --> 00:16:02,962
if he doesn't go at out around 10.

327
00:16:03,127 --> 00:16:07,040
Okay, okay, okay. How's this?
I will stay and walk Eddie.

328
00:16:07,207 --> 00:16:09,675
- Really?
- You just don't want to see Billy Joel.

329
00:16:09,887 --> 00:16:12,606
Ugh. That is patently untrue.
I'm just trying to help my father.

330
00:16:12,807 --> 00:16:15,082
Well, if he isn't going, can I?

331
00:16:16,647 --> 00:16:18,239
Well, that would work perfectly.

332
00:16:18,447 --> 00:16:21,359
Since you're free, I've got
this extra ticket for the throat-singing.

333
00:16:21,527 --> 00:16:23,119
- Oh.
- Well, then it's settled.

334
00:16:23,287 --> 00:16:25,755
FRASIER: Ha, ha.
- Eddie.

335
00:16:25,927 --> 00:16:30,125
Oh, dear. All right, okay, okay.
We will work this out, Dad.

336
00:16:30,487 --> 00:16:34,082
DAPHNE: So, what happens
when your nibs explode?

Ugh. What's all the fuss about?
It's only my hip.

340

Ten bucks says I'll be back on the job
in a couple weeks.

341
00:16:53,447 --> 00:16:56,405
I just keep thinking, you know,
it should have been me.

342
00:16:58,047 --> 00:17:00,083
Can I do anything to make you
more comfortable?

343
00:17:00,287 --> 00:17:01,606
I'm fine, thanks.

344
00:17:03,887 --> 00:17:05,878
Seriously, it should have been me.

How are you...?
How are you feeling?

349

I think I'm gonna be fine.

Well, thank God.

- Well, I better get going.
- Oh, no.

- Don't go on my account.
- No, Frank.

No, you guys got plenty of things
to talk about. Listen.

I'll never drink
another Slushee again.

355
00:17:33,807 --> 00:17:35,604
Well, then, it was worth it.

See you.

Good.

I'll never understand

No, you probably won't.

All right, we're running out of time.
I'll tell you what.

I will offer a hundred dollars

I'll kick in a hundred.

That's $200.
That's an awful lot of money, isn't it?
