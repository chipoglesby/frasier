for patients to displace feelings

47
00:02:31,807 --> 00:02:35,117
they have for someone else onto their
psychiatrist. It's called transference.

So even if a patient thinks she might
be in love with me, she really isn't.

or why I was there.

305
00:17:53,247 --> 00:17:56,239
I know it doesn't make it okay,
but I was just so worried

306
00:17:56,407 --> 00:17:59,160
and I had to find
out who she was and...

307
00:17:59,327 --> 00:18:02,922
I'm so sorry. I feel so ashamed.

308
00:18:03,087 --> 00:18:05,999
It was all Roz's idea.

309
00:18:10,487 --> 00:18:14,162
Look, I know you're angry,
but please say something.

310
00:18:15,247 --> 00:18:17,442
- Angry doesn't begin to describe it.
- Niles...

311
00:18:17,607 --> 00:18:21,202
You have violated
this person's privacy.

312
00:18:21,367 --> 00:18:24,325
If she found out,
they could suspend my licence.

313
00:18:24,527 --> 00:18:26,279
I am so sorry.

314
00:18:26,447 --> 00:18:29,883
And you don't trust me.

315
00:18:31,727 --> 00:18:35,561
How could you possibly think
there could be somebody else?

316
00:18:36,087 --> 00:18:38,476
Because I was somebody else.

317
00:18:38,647 --> 00:18:40,239
What?

318
00:18:41,247 --> 00:18:42,999
You were married
to two other women

319
00:18:43,167 --> 00:18:45,203
while you claimed
to have been in love with me.

320
00:18:45,367 --> 00:18:48,484
Well, now that we're together,
how can I be sure,

321
00:18:48,647 --> 00:18:52,845
really sure, that there won't ever be
another somebody else?

322
00:18:53,007 --> 00:18:56,317
Because I would never... Ugh.

323
00:19:03,207 --> 00:19:06,517
Because this time it's different.

324
00:19:07,087 --> 00:19:09,282
Our love is different.

325
00:19:09,447 --> 00:19:13,201
It's not based
on somebody's expectations

326
00:19:14,007 --> 00:19:16,282
or anything I'm supposed to be.

327
00:19:16,447 --> 00:19:20,804
When I was with Maris or with Mel,
I found myself thinking about you.

328
00:19:21,847 --> 00:19:25,965
Going about my day,
or even when I was in a session,

329
00:19:26,127 --> 00:19:28,482
I found myself thinking about you.

330
00:19:29,007 --> 00:19:31,043
Well, now we're together.

331
00:19:32,407 --> 00:19:35,046
I find myself thinking about you.

332
00:19:36,487 --> 00:19:38,125
It's not going to stop.

333
00:19:44,847 --> 00:19:46,724
I'm still mad at you.

334
00:19:48,527 --> 00:19:50,279
I know.
