of the leak in my ceiling.

It is Cam Winston's brand-new
washing machine.

By Godfrey,
this time he's gone too far.

12

installing an illegal washer-dryer.

Oh, they're not illegal.
A lot of the units have them.

18

You guys have a hook-up in the hall
closet where you keep all those hats.

First of all, I had completely forgotten
about the hook-up.

Second of all, I believe the Homburg
is poised for a comeback.

And third,
we have a more immediate problem

22
00:01:11,687 --> 00:01:14,155
in the form of the evil waters
of Cam Winston.

23

Mr. Winston to not use the machine

Wrong! We've got
to teach Cam a lesson

and shut his water off right now.

It's called a Segway.

35

My friend Raul at the university
is doing an experiment

36

on the psychological effects
of technology,

- Well, how do you like it?

Walking is but a distant memory.

Better yet, I can redirect
the unused energy to other pursuits

Nothing would please me more.
But no.

One of the conditions
of the experiment

is that I can't share the Segway

Well done.

314
00:16:09,087 --> 00:16:12,841
And in the same spirit
of hatchet burying,

315
00:16:13,007 --> 00:16:17,080
I agree to pay
for your ruined clothes. Cheers.

316
00:16:21,327 --> 00:16:22,646
Yeah.

317
00:16:25,327 --> 00:16:27,887
Since things seem to be off
on such a good foot,

318
00:16:28,047 --> 00:16:31,244
perhaps now is the time
to discuss the mailbox situation.

319
00:16:31,927 --> 00:16:33,042
You wanna switch, don't you?

320
00:16:33,207 --> 00:16:35,801
As a tall man, I dislike
having to stoop for my mail.

321
00:16:35,967 --> 00:16:37,116
Indeed.

322
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:39,357
Well, I would prefer
to set aside that explosive issue

323
00:16:39,527 --> 00:16:41,040
until we're sure
the truce will hold.

324
00:16:41,207 --> 00:16:42,959
I see.

325
00:16:43,287 --> 00:16:44,879
Fair enough.

326
00:16:46,447 --> 00:16:49,723
Unless you're willing to agree on some
sort of noise-abatement framework.

327
00:16:49,887 --> 00:16:53,516
You see, you have
a unique sliding gait, Cam.

328
00:16:53,687 --> 00:16:55,518
When you wear your heeled boots,
the resultant:

329
00:16:55,687 --> 00:16:58,121
Shh, clop, shh, clop, shh clop,

330
00:16:58,287 --> 00:17:01,006
well, it just sounds like
a dancing pony in my apartment.

331
00:17:01,207 --> 00:17:04,324
Perhaps we should get some paper
so we can write all this down.

332
00:17:08,847 --> 00:17:12,635
Fine. I will arrange an introduction
to my sweater weaver.

333
00:17:12,807 --> 00:17:14,957
Good. Thank you.

334
00:17:15,127 --> 00:17:19,006
But then I must insist
on the formula to your bath blend.

335
00:17:27,727 --> 00:17:29,524
I think we were closer
on an earlier draft.

336
00:17:29,687 --> 00:17:31,040
Concur.

337
00:17:35,727 --> 00:17:36,955
- Hey, Niles.
- Mm-hm.

338
00:17:37,127 --> 00:17:39,561
That Truffaut film you like
is playing down at the LaSalle.

339
00:17:39,727 --> 00:17:41,843
Oh, sounds tempting.

340
00:17:42,007 --> 00:17:45,761
Oh, but the people behind me
wouldn't be able to see.

341
00:17:46,767 --> 00:17:48,519
I guess we'll stay in then.

342
00:17:48,687 --> 00:17:50,405
I'm going to go take a bath.

343
00:17:50,567 --> 00:17:56,085
It's too bad you have to stay on that.
I could use a third and a fourth hand.

344
00:17:56,887 --> 00:18:00,516
NILES:
Oh... Uh... Uh...

345
00:18:00,687 --> 00:18:04,043
Wait, wait, Daphne, Daphne, Daphne,
there we go.

346
00:18:04,207 --> 00:18:07,324
Coming. You wait there.
I'll light the candles.

347
00:18:08,207 --> 00:18:10,562
So long, sucker. Ha!

348
00:18:11,287 --> 00:18:12,959
NILES: Daphne, what are you doing?
- Whoo!

349
00:18:13,127 --> 00:18:16,676
Hold the door. Whoo-hoo!

350
00:18:16,847 --> 00:18:20,556
Whoa! Ho! Whoo!

351
00:18:21,887 --> 00:18:24,082
MARTIN: Hey, boys.
- Have you two been fighting?

352
00:18:24,247 --> 00:18:25,396
FRASIER:
On the contrary.

353
00:18:25,727 --> 00:18:26,842
Cam and I
are here to announce

354
00:18:27,007 --> 00:18:29,475
the cessation
of all hostilities between us.

355
00:18:30,447 --> 00:18:32,005
We are officially friends.

356
00:18:32,167 --> 00:18:34,203
- As defined by the treaty.
- Ah.

357
00:18:35,607 --> 00:18:37,802
Well, that means a lot to us.

358
00:18:37,967 --> 00:18:42,802
Oh, I think it's safe to say that we've
entered a whole new era of cooper...

359
00:18:44,207 --> 00:18:45,720
Did you get that
at Mueller's Antiques?

360
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:48,765
Yes, as a matter of fact I did.
It represents a great triumph for me.

361
00:18:48,927 --> 00:18:52,237
I snatched it from under the nose
of a collector who had actually put a...

362
00:18:53,407 --> 00:18:59,039
You were saying it's a new era
of cooperation. How wonderful.

363
00:18:59,207 --> 00:19:00,435
You should celebrate.

364
00:19:00,607 --> 00:19:03,246
The two of you
should go to the symphony tonight.

365
00:19:03,407 --> 00:19:05,398
Uh, but I thought
you and I were going.

366
00:19:05,807 --> 00:19:07,604
I'm going to stay here with Martin.

367
00:19:07,767 --> 00:19:10,486
- Well, I suppose.
- Well, then you'd better hurry.

368
00:19:10,647 --> 00:19:13,525
Cam likes to preorder
his intermission cocktail.

369
00:19:13,687 --> 00:19:15,484
Oh. You mean you don't have
a standing order?

370
00:19:15,647 --> 00:19:18,605
Well, we'd better hurry then.
We'll take my car.

371
00:19:18,767 --> 00:19:20,758
I've seen you drive.
We'll take mine.

372
00:19:20,927 --> 00:19:22,679
What, your Humvee? I think not.

373
00:19:22,847 --> 00:19:24,519
Not in front of the parents, Crane.

374
00:19:24,807 --> 00:19:28,402
DAPHNE: Whoo-hoo!
NILES: Daphne, Daphne, Daphne.

375
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:33,247
I can't believe they're gonna
spend the whole evening together.

376
00:19:33,407 --> 00:19:38,117
Oh, I know. If they get through it alive,
we should probably tell them the truth.

377
00:19:38,287 --> 00:19:39,959
Yeah.

378
00:19:40,127 --> 00:19:43,881
Too bad. It was fun
being your boyfriend for a few days.

379
00:19:44,047 --> 00:19:45,765
- It was.
- Ha-ha-ha.

380
00:19:45,927 --> 00:19:49,078
Still, all good things
must come to an end.

381
00:20:02,407 --> 00:20:04,523
But who knows when?
