1
00:00:08,527 --> 00:00:11,644
- You could live here.
- Are you asking me?

2
00:00:11,807 --> 00:00:14,765
- Would you like to?
- Would you like me to?

3
00:00:14,927 --> 00:00:17,725
- Yeah.
- Then I will.

4
00:00:17,887 --> 00:00:22,039
I gave the greatest speech
of my condo-board career,

5
00:00:22,207 --> 00:00:24,675
which lead to a vote, which lead
to the ruling that Cam Winston

6
00:00:24,847 --> 00:00:28,840
must now park that SUV monstrosity
of his in the sub-basement.

7
00:00:29,167 --> 00:00:32,079
You think that's smart, ticking off
the guy who lives right above us?

8
00:00:32,247 --> 00:00:34,715
- Well, the move's off.
- What?

9
00:00:34,887 --> 00:00:37,321
Just temporarily.
My parents are coming for a visit.

10
00:00:37,487 --> 00:00:39,557
Just to clarify,
you're going to stay here,

11
00:00:39,727 --> 00:00:41,558
but your parents
are going to stay with me.

12
00:00:41,727 --> 00:00:43,763
I'm so glad you understand.

13
00:00:44,407 --> 00:00:45,760
If she thinks you're a virgin,

14
00:00:45,927 --> 00:00:48,157
how are you going to explain
our plan to live together?

15
00:00:48,327 --> 00:00:51,603
I wonder how important it is
that she ever finds out.

16
00:00:51,767 --> 00:00:53,883
- Dad scarpered.
- He left?

17
00:00:54,047 --> 00:00:55,605
SIMON: Yeah.
- It's true.

18
00:00:56,047 --> 00:00:59,642
Thank goodness I have my children
to lean upon.

19
00:00:59,807 --> 00:01:00,842
Oh, don't cry, Mum.

20
00:01:01,007 --> 00:01:04,044
I really thought this junket to America
would cheer you up.

21
00:01:04,207 --> 00:01:07,199
It still can.
Get out there and see the country.

22
00:01:07,367 --> 00:01:10,757
Yes, immerse yourself in the spectacle
and the grandeur

23
00:01:10,927 --> 00:01:15,125
that are these United States,
this America.

24
00:01:17,527 --> 00:01:18,801
How did you do that?

25
00:01:19,207 --> 00:01:21,846
Cam Winston!

26
00:01:24,927 --> 00:01:26,963
It was a good idea,
taking Mum out today.

27
00:01:27,127 --> 00:01:29,038
- Helped take her mind off Dad.
- Yeah.

28
00:01:29,207 --> 00:01:32,483
Though I'm not sure the zoo
was the best idea.

29
00:01:32,647 --> 00:01:36,196
The sight of those amorous wolverines
seemed to set her back a bit.

30
00:01:36,607 --> 00:01:39,599
Amorous? I thought
they were trying to kill each other.

31
00:01:40,087 --> 00:01:43,045
Well, either way,
it seemed to remind her of something.

32
00:01:45,607 --> 00:01:48,997
Hello, Mrs. Moon.
Would you care for a bite to eat?

33
00:01:49,167 --> 00:01:53,285
Oh, that would be lovely, if I thought
I could keep anything down.

34
00:01:54,127 --> 00:01:57,199
How could your father do this to me?

35
00:01:57,367 --> 00:02:00,165
You sleep down the hall from someone
for 40 years,

36
00:02:00,327 --> 00:02:02,443
you think you know them...

37
00:02:03,287 --> 00:02:04,800
I know you're upset, Mum,

38
00:02:04,967 --> 00:02:07,481
but it's not like you and Dad
had a perfect marriage.

39
00:02:07,647 --> 00:02:09,603
That's because
there's no such thing.

40
00:02:09,767 --> 00:02:10,836
You young, modern people

41
00:02:11,007 --> 00:02:14,795
think marriage is some sort of
promenade through paradise,

44
00:02:22,607 --> 00:02:26,043
Yeah, obviously this is
a very upsetting time for all of us.

45
00:02:26,207 --> 00:02:28,482
But remember,
tomorrow is another day.

46
00:02:28,647 --> 00:02:29,921
You're right, dear.

47
00:02:30,087 --> 00:02:32,726
And the sooner you get home to bed,
the sooner it'll be here.

48
00:02:32,887 --> 00:02:33,876
But it's only 9:30.

49
00:02:34,047 --> 00:02:37,722
And with every tick of the clock,
your womanly resistance weakens.

50
00:02:37,887 --> 00:02:39,718
And before you know it,
he'll be on top of you

51
00:02:39,887 --> 00:02:42,765
like one of those bloody badgers
at the zoo.

52
00:02:45,167 --> 00:02:46,646
Actually, those were wolverines,

53
00:02:46,807 --> 00:02:49,446
and there's a chance
they may have been fighting.

54
00:02:49,927 --> 00:02:52,646
It has been a long day.
Maybe it's best if I leave.

55
00:02:52,807 --> 00:02:54,035
- All right.
- Yeah.

56
00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:56,437
I'll see you tomorrow, Mum.

57
00:02:58,847 --> 00:03:01,281
- Good night, Niles.
- Good night.

58
00:03:13,967 --> 00:03:16,276
Well, hey, you still up?

59
00:03:16,567 --> 00:03:18,285
Can't sleep.

60
00:03:19,047 --> 00:03:21,117
Every time I look outside,

61
00:03:21,767 --> 00:03:25,157
I feel like I'm living inside
a giant clown's pocket.

62
00:03:26,607 --> 00:03:29,326
I tell you, Cam Winston
has not heard the last of this.

63
00:03:29,487 --> 00:03:32,320
I am calling an emergency meeting
of the condo board tomorrow morning.

64
00:03:32,487 --> 00:03:35,479
You can't fight this, Fras. It'll just
look like you're attacking the flag.

65
00:03:35,647 --> 00:03:38,445
I'm not attacking the flag.
Cam is using the flag to attack me.

66
00:03:38,607 --> 00:03:40,199
You're right,
but you're still gonna lose.

67
00:03:40,367 --> 00:03:42,562
But the building has bylaws
about this sort of thing.

68
00:03:42,727 --> 00:03:44,399
If this was anything
but the American flag,

69
00:03:44,567 --> 00:03:46,319
people would demand
that it be taken down.

70
00:03:46,647 --> 00:03:49,400
Face it, Fras,
Cam's got you on this one.

71
00:03:49,567 --> 00:03:52,877
- Boy, I have to say, that guy is smart.
- Oh, really?

72
00:03:53,047 --> 00:03:56,357
If he's so smart and you're so smart,
why don't you two live together?

73
00:03:58,687 --> 00:04:00,723
At least he's got a view.

74
00:04:03,567 --> 00:04:05,922
What on earth
do you think you're doing?

75
00:04:06,087 --> 00:04:08,237
Oh, sorry.
I didn't know you was here.

76
00:04:08,407 --> 00:04:11,524
Oh, Frasier, this is Loretta.

77
00:04:11,687 --> 00:04:14,679
Loretta...
Well, you know who you are.

I love your curtains.

I'm sorry, but we are not
entertaining guests this evening.

82
00:04:24,727 --> 00:04:26,240
You'll have to leave.

83
00:04:26,407 --> 00:04:28,967
Wait. You told me
this was your place.

84
00:04:29,127 --> 00:04:31,357
You're probably
not even the duke of England.

85
00:04:31,527 --> 00:04:34,405
Oh, yeah?
Then why do I talk this way?

86
00:04:36,847 --> 00:04:40,886
Well, you're just a big contraceptive,
aren't you?

87
00:04:43,487 --> 00:04:45,842
I've just about had it
with you, Simon.

88
00:04:46,007 --> 00:04:50,523
You have blown my speakers,
you have clogged my Jacuzzi

89
00:04:50,687 --> 00:04:54,566
and you have ingested
half of my bath products.

90
00:04:54,727 --> 00:04:56,479
You are no longer welcome
in my home.

91
00:04:56,647 --> 00:05:00,037
- What exactly are you implying?
- Get out!

92
00:05:01,047 --> 00:05:03,607
Fras, you can't throw him out.
Where's he gonna go?

93
00:05:03,767 --> 00:05:06,042
Oh, he'll land on his feet.

94
00:05:06,207 --> 00:05:09,643
Probably end up shacking up
with some two-bit floozy.

95
00:05:13,167 --> 00:05:14,839
Simon.

96
00:05:16,647 --> 00:05:19,002
- What are you doing here?
- Hello, love.

97
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:23,759
It appears that the front door
to the building is locked.

98
00:05:23,927 --> 00:05:26,760
Yeah, that's how we keep drunks
from wandering in.

99
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:29,919
Well, I seem to be without appropriate
accommodation at the moment.

100
00:05:30,087 --> 00:05:32,806
I just thought I'd take you up
on your kind and generous offer.

101
00:05:32,967 --> 00:05:34,844
I never said you could stay here.

102
00:05:35,007 --> 00:05:36,918
Well, Frasier's thrown me out.

103
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:38,998
All right, well,
sleep in Martin's Winnebago.

104
00:05:39,167 --> 00:05:41,522
Well, wouldn't I love to do that,
but when I got down there,

105
00:05:41,687 --> 00:05:44,997
there was this gigantic Humvee
blocking the door.

106
00:05:45,367 --> 00:05:47,358
Simon, this isn't my problem.

107
00:05:47,527 --> 00:05:49,597
- Well...
- You have got to go.

108
00:05:49,767 --> 00:05:52,884
Look, Roz, I'll level with you.

109
00:05:53,047 --> 00:05:55,402
I know that we've had
a chequered history,

110
00:05:55,767 --> 00:06:00,079
and I'm probably not the sort of person
that you'd want in your house.

111
00:06:00,807 --> 00:06:03,446
But I'm asking for your help.

112
00:06:03,807 --> 00:06:07,163
As a friend. As Daphne's brother.

113
00:06:07,327 --> 00:06:11,366
Please, just let me stay one night.

114
00:06:11,527 --> 00:06:12,926
You won't even notice me.

115
00:06:13,087 --> 00:06:17,365
Just the tiniest spot on the floor
would be a gift.

116
00:06:17,527 --> 00:06:20,485
Look, I'll be gone in the morning.
I'll never darken your doorstep again.

Please, Roz,
I've got nowhere else to go.

118

All right.
I'll make up the couch for you.

Oh, thank you, Roz.
You have got a good heart.

Daphne,

in the American flag?

to say that at a condo-board meeting?
