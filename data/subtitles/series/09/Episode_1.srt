Hey, Roz. Hi, Frasier.

Lana, uh, hi, um.

- Hello.
- Wow, you look great.

162
00:08:04,887 --> 00:08:08,038
Not as great as you do.
I mean, thanks, ha, ha.

163
00:08:08,207 --> 00:08:11,517
- Hey, Roz.
- Kirby.

164
00:08:11,687 --> 00:08:14,679
- It's been too long.
- No, it hasn't.

165
00:08:15,687 --> 00:08:18,281
- Or has it?
- No.

166
00:08:18,887 --> 00:08:20,002
So, what brings you here?

167
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:22,078
Well, actually,
we just picked up the invitations

168
00:08:22,247 --> 00:08:24,238
- for Kirby's graduation party.
- Oh.

169
00:08:24,407 --> 00:08:27,365
Roz, you're invited too.
After all, you motivated Kirby to study.

170
00:08:27,527 --> 00:08:29,324
Well, no,
Frasier was the one who helped him.

171
00:08:29,487 --> 00:08:31,557
I was just his last-minute prom date.

172

You were the prize
that I kept my eyes on.

173
00:08:35,607 --> 00:08:39,236
And for your FYI,
I'm cool for hanging out

174
00:08:39,407 --> 00:08:43,286
just as platonic friends
or whatever.

Um, Kirby, we should go
if we're gonna pick up your inhaler.

00:08:47,047 --> 00:08:49,117
Thanks a lot, Mom.

I only need it in the fall.

- Oh, we'll see you at the party.
- Right.

179
00:08:58,047 --> 00:08:59,605
Hey, Frasier,
don't you be a stranger.

180

Oh, no, I won't, uh.

Don't you be a stranger either,

- Let me guess. Lana in, Claire out.
- What, that? Oh, that was nothing.

184
00:09:17,007 --> 00:09:22,035
She just merely caught me off guard.
Don't go reading anything into that.

185
00:09:22,207 --> 00:09:23,606
Okay, if you say so.

186
00:09:23,767 --> 00:09:25,200
- Frasier, I gotta go.
- All right.

187
00:09:25,367 --> 00:09:29,918
But let not either us
be strangers be.

188

Oh, I apologise
for the inconvenience

189

but, uh, at least
there's a happy ending, right?

190
00:09:43,687 --> 00:09:45,643
And my suitcase

191
00:09:46,407 --> 00:09:49,285
is inside this to keep it safe?

192
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:51,605
- So...
- That is not my bag.

Right. I'll keep looking.

her name's Kathy. She's great.

But the only problem
is I can't stop thinking about my ex.

207
00:10:38,287 --> 00:10:41,165
I mean, she was a real handful,
but now that we're apart,

208
00:10:41,327 --> 00:10:44,364
- I just miss her like crazy.
- Of course you do.

209
00:10:44,527 --> 00:10:47,121
And no matter how hard you try
to focus on this new relationship,

210
00:10:47,287 --> 00:10:51,565
- your mind keeps drifting back to her.
- Exactly. I mean, I even have these...

- Dreams.
- Yes.

Wow, you're good.
What should I do?

Well, what are you thinking
of doing?

Yeah...

The classic shrink response. Um...

00:11:04,127 --> 00:11:05,924
I'm thinking,

217
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:08,243
do I really wanna break things off
with this woman?

218
00:11:08,407 --> 00:11:11,126
- Who you thought was perfect for you.
- But how perfect could she be

219
00:11:11,287 --> 00:11:12,800
if I'm obsessing
about another woman?

220
00:11:12,967 --> 00:11:16,721
- That's the conundrum.
- Am I sure enough to break her heart?

221
00:11:17,647 --> 00:11:19,956
Yes, especially when the rest
of the family just loves her.

222
00:11:20,127 --> 00:11:22,800
- Yeah... No, they don't.
- No, stick with me. Stick with me.

00:11:23,647 --> 00:11:26,002
It all boils down to this:

224
00:11:26,167 --> 00:11:28,522
Which of these two women

225
00:11:28,687 --> 00:11:32,441
do you see
spending the rest of your life with?

226

Right.

with myself, she's the one I love.

Roz told me about this wonderful
nude beach

00:13:19,367 --> 00:13:21,597
so I went down there this morning
to check it out for us.

Well, it was so peaceful,

have my naked body caressed

I have waited over a year
for that man to come back to me.

- No, you didn't want to love her.

775
00:39:11,727 --> 00:39:14,321
- She was too good.
- And that's why you were afraid.

776
00:39:14,487 --> 00:39:16,717
All right, you're saying that I'm afraid
of a good woman?

777
00:39:16,887 --> 00:39:19,447
You're afraid
of losing a good woman.

779

So that's it?

780
00:39:28,287 --> 00:39:32,439
All this work just to find out
that I have a fear of rejection?

781
00:39:32,607 --> 00:39:34,325
That's right.

782
00:39:35,807 --> 00:39:37,877
So I'm alone...

783
00:39:38,807 --> 00:39:41,560
...because I'm afraid to be alone?

784
00:39:42,007 --> 00:39:43,599
Yes.

785
00:39:45,047 --> 00:39:46,639
Don't feel too bad.
You'll always have us.

That's my problem.

00:39:57,207 --> 00:39:59,960
You are always there.

792
00:40:01,287 --> 00:40:06,964
I have carried you with me throughout
every relationship, on every date.

793
00:40:07,127 --> 00:40:09,038
You pick apart
the women I care about.

794
00:40:09,207 --> 00:40:12,563
And you remind me how much it'll hurt
if I open myself up.

795
00:40:13,527 --> 00:40:16,803
You don't help me.
You hold me back.

796
00:40:16,967 --> 00:40:19,481
How will I ever move forward

797
00:40:19,647 --> 00:40:23,083
if I don't put you behind me?

798
00:40:39,007 --> 00:40:41,077
Hurry along, Daphne,
we'll miss the curtain.

799
00:40:41,247 --> 00:40:45,160
Yeah, and you know how strict
they are about that at the Cineplex.

800
00:40:46,047 --> 00:40:48,880
Sorry. I was rushing and I put
my heel through the hem of my skirt,

801
00:40:49,047 --> 00:40:50,275
so I had to put on another one.

802
00:40:50,447 --> 00:40:52,165
- Oh, it looks nice.
- Thanks.

803
00:40:52,327 --> 00:40:54,204
Then the top didn't go,
so I changed it to this.

804
00:40:54,367 --> 00:40:56,927
I couldn't wear this with a black
brassiere. I had to change that.

805
00:40:57,087 --> 00:41:00,397
I had to change my knickers to match,
in case I go to the hospital.

806

Coordinating undergarments
are the mark of a lady, and all that.

807
00:41:04,447 --> 00:41:06,483
Anyway, it's a long story.
I won't bore you with it.

808
00:41:06,647 --> 00:41:07,921
Yeah, thanks.

Hi, guys.

811
00:41:12,487 --> 00:41:16,116
- How are you, Dr. Crane?
- Actually, I'm... I'm fine, Daphne.

812
00:41:16,287 --> 00:41:19,563
In fact, my little retreat
was just what this doctor ordered.

813
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:23,436
I cleared my head
and came to some conclusions.

814
00:41:23,607 --> 00:41:24,722
So where are you guys off to?

815
00:41:24,887 --> 00:41:26,764
Oh, just one of Dad's movies.
You wanna join us?

816
00:41:26,927 --> 00:41:28,963
I brought my ltty Bitty Book Light.

817
00:41:30,247 --> 00:41:31,600
No, thanks. You guys go ahead.

818
00:41:31,767 --> 00:41:34,759
- You'll be okay, won't you?
- Ah, yes, I'll be just fine.

819
00:41:34,927 --> 00:41:36,679
Why don't I just stay here,
keep you company?

820
00:41:36,847 --> 00:41:38,075
- No, Dad, I'm fine.
- You sure?

821
00:41:38,247 --> 00:41:40,807
Yes. In fact, I'm...

822
00:41:41,327 --> 00:41:43,761
I'm better than I've been
in quite some time.

823
00:41:43,927 --> 00:41:46,760
Mainly because
of one very important thing I learned.

00:41:46,927 --> 00:41:48,918
Great. Let's roll.
