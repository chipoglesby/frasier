00:15:41,807 --> 00:15:44,719
All right, listen. I'll take Daphne
into the guestroom to lie down

316
00:15:44,887 --> 00:15:46,923
so you can get everybody out of here.
Just be quiet.

317
00:15:47,087 --> 00:15:48,600
Don't wanna blow the surprise
for next time.

DAPHNE: Niles, I think
there's a bird loose in here.

320
00:15:56,167 --> 00:15:58,476
I thought doves
might be a nice addition.

321
00:16:01,287 --> 00:16:02,640
It looked like a dove.

322
00:16:02,807 --> 00:16:07,722
Oh. I think your fever
is causing you to hallucinate.

323
00:16:13,207 --> 00:16:17,086
Come along, let's take you
to the guestroom for a good lie-down.

324
00:16:17,247 --> 00:16:19,807
- Why you yelling?
- Because your ears are all stuffed up.

325
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:22,322
- No, they're not.
- They're not? Oh, maybe mine are.

326
00:16:22,487 --> 00:16:24,637
Gee, I hope I'm not getting
what you have.

327
00:16:35,247 --> 00:16:37,761
Shh. Everyone, everyone. Shh.

328
00:16:37,927 --> 00:16:40,316
Very quietly,
I have an announcement to make.

329
00:16:41,927 --> 00:16:44,122
I'm terribly sorry,
but tonight's festivities

330
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:48,326
have been indefinitely postponed
due to illness.

331
00:16:48,487 --> 00:16:51,763
- But we still get paid, right?
- Yes, you still get paid.

332
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:56,921
Um, now, I need all of you to file
quickly and quietly out the front door.

333
00:16:57,087 --> 00:17:00,159
It is imperative the young lady
not know any of you were ever here.

334
00:17:00,327 --> 00:17:02,761
DAPHNE: I'm telling you,
that room has a draught.

335
00:17:02,927 --> 00:17:04,883
Hit the dirt.

336
00:17:05,047 --> 00:17:07,322
DAPHNE: We can't we sit
in the living room, build a fire?

337
00:17:07,487 --> 00:17:09,717
No, no, no, we can't go
in the living room because...

338
00:17:10,687 --> 00:17:12,120
That...

339
00:17:13,127 --> 00:17:15,561
Of course we can go in the living room
and have a nice fire.

340
00:17:15,727 --> 00:17:17,206
Come here and sit down.

Oh, um, do you wanna borrow
my pyjamas?

342
00:17:19,847 --> 00:17:21,326
No, I feel silly in those.

343
00:17:21,487 --> 00:17:22,522
They're so big and baggy.

344
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:25,201
I'm the only one here
who's gonna see you.

345
00:17:33,767 --> 00:17:37,123
- Oh, how about some tea?
- Hmm. Not now.

346
00:17:42,207 --> 00:17:44,846
Oh, I have some of those
raspberry candies you like.

No, you stay right here
next to me, Niles Crane.

- You kidding?
