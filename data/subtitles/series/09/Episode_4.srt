I didn't think she'd last a week.

169

Yet she somehow managed
to forge a relationship

170
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:37,921
with a blustery psychiatrist
and a crotchety old man.

she wouldn't be around forever,

she'd end up with Niles.

My parents are coming for a visit.

Well, what does that have to do
with us living together?

there is involved with a move,

it's best if we wait
till after they leave.

187

Or we could call a mover

and have your stuff
over at my place by tomorrow.

until after their visit to move.

to be dating a man who's always right?

I'll just go put the kettle on.

You hear the way she talks to Daphne,
and Daphne just takes it.

Well, it's understandable, Niles.

I mean, after all,
she only sees her mother rarely.

I suppose it's just easier
to bite her tongue

in some kind of ugly confrontation.

Well, maybe so, but it's just frustrating
to see Daphne so timid.

I just might.

you'd have something nicer
for your guests who smoke.

Well, customarily, my guests
