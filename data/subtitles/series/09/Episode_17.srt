00:08:23,927 --> 00:08:26,521
Well, your fatal charm
is not gonna work this time.

156
00:08:26,727 --> 00:08:30,686
So you can drag your sorry ass back
to that barstool it normally sags over

157
00:08:30,847 --> 00:08:32,485
and leave me the hell alone!

158
00:08:35,087 --> 00:08:37,362
Thank you, Niles,
that was a nice surprise.

159
00:08:40,207 --> 00:08:42,323
You're right. She has mellowed.

160
00:08:44,767 --> 00:08:47,600
See? And I'm... I'm sure
if you just give her a little more time,

161
00:08:47,767 --> 00:08:50,520
- you'll work everything out.
- I gave it my best shot.

162
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:53,520
- I'm gonna go pack.
- Daddy.

163
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:58,642
I don't understand. He came all this
way and he's just gonna give up?

164
00:08:58,807 --> 00:09:01,924
Well, actually,
he didn't even want to come.

165
00:09:02,087 --> 00:09:06,558
I sort of flew to England
and persuaded him.

166
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:11,083
- You what?
- I wanted to surprise you.

167
00:09:11,927 --> 00:09:14,441
How could you do this
without talking to me first?

168
00:09:15,047 --> 00:09:16,799
That would've ruined the surprise.

169
00:09:17,327 --> 00:09:20,000
Niles, I could have flown
to England and talked to him too.

170
00:09:20,167 --> 00:09:22,522
But I didn't
because I know my parents.

171
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:25,076
When they fight, they need
time apart to miss each other.

172
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:28,603
And you would have known that
had you consulted me first.

173
00:09:29,607 --> 00:09:33,236
HARRY: I'm off.
- Uh, Mr. Moon, Mr. Moon, wait.

174
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:35,557
Just... Just... Just stay one more day

175
00:09:35,727 --> 00:09:39,197
and spend a little more time with
your daughter. I'll put you up in a hotel.

176
00:09:39,407 --> 00:09:43,400
I can't let you buy me a suite
in a five-star hotel.

177
00:09:53,687 --> 00:09:56,042
- I'm sorry I yelled at you last night.
- No, no, I'm sorry.

178
00:09:56,207 --> 00:09:58,562
L... I was thinking about it.
You were absolutely right.

179
00:09:58,767 --> 00:10:01,235
Look... We are a team now,
and bringing your dad back

180
00:10:01,407 --> 00:10:04,126
- should have been our joint decision.
- Thanks for understanding.

181
00:10:04,327 --> 00:10:06,363
Anyway, what's done is done.

182
00:10:06,527 --> 00:10:08,119
Mum's taken her claws
out of the ceiling,

183
00:10:08,287 --> 00:10:09,561
and Dad's headed back to England.

184
00:10:09,767 --> 00:10:12,327
Actually, I convinced him
to stay another day.

185
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:14,364
I thought I should tell you
since we're a team.

186
00:10:15,207 --> 00:10:17,198
- You what?
- Well, I thought you'd wanna

187
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:18,766
spend more time with him. Plus,

188
00:10:18,927 --> 00:10:21,646
since they're both in the same city,
we can get them together tonight.

189
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:23,839
Or not.

190
00:10:24,047 --> 00:10:26,117
We're a team.

191
00:10:26,287 --> 00:10:28,278
It's totally up to you.

192
00:10:28,927 --> 00:10:32,158
I don't know. Maybe we should
let them work it out for themselves.

193
00:10:32,367 --> 00:10:35,598
Yeah. Or, on the other hand,
maybe our love will inspire them,

194
00:10:35,767 --> 00:10:39,043
and come October,
they'll be dancing at our wedding.

195
00:10:39,247 --> 00:10:41,477
- That would be wonderful.
- Oh, hi, guys.

196
00:10:41,647 --> 00:10:44,002
Hey, Frasier. Frasier, listen. Uh...

197
00:10:44,167 --> 00:10:46,397
Daphne and I are taking her parents
out to dinner tonight.

198
00:10:46,607 --> 00:10:48,279
Can you get us a reservation
at Chez Henri?

199
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,766
Oh, Chez Henri.

200
00:10:49,927 --> 00:10:51,599
Niles, they're booked up
months in advance.

201
00:10:51,767 --> 00:10:54,406
I know that I wouldn't get in,
but I was hoping if I cloaked myself

202
00:10:54,567 --> 00:10:56,956
- in the mantle of your renown...
- You know better than that.

203
00:10:57,127 --> 00:10:59,277
Niles, I am not susceptible to flattery.

204
00:10:59,447 --> 00:11:01,836
I know. You're the most grounded,
down-to-earth person I know.

205
00:11:02,007 --> 00:11:03,998
Thank you. I'll make a call.

206
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:07,760
- Hey, Daphne, Niles. Frasier.
- Oh! Roz, Roz.

207
00:11:07,927 --> 00:11:11,840
Uh, listen,
I wanted to talk to you about this.

208
00:11:12,007 --> 00:11:17,843
- Oh, my God. You still have that?
- Yes, well, I was glancing at it.

209
00:11:18,367 --> 00:11:22,997
I couldn't help but notice
that the overall score you gave me,

210
00:11:23,167 --> 00:11:27,240
out of a possible five cups of coffee,

211
00:11:27,407 --> 00:11:29,443
was a four.

212
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:32,241
- Yeah. That's a good score.
- It's... It's a fine score.

213
00:11:32,407 --> 00:11:34,762
But it occurs to me that this presents
an opportunity for me

214
00:11:34,927 --> 00:11:39,239
to learn something about my
performance that might benefit me.

215
00:11:39,447 --> 00:11:41,802
So, what might I have done

216
00:11:42,367 --> 00:11:45,677
to earn that elusive fifth cup?

217
00:11:47,087 --> 00:11:50,079
Oh, I'm a tough grader.
No one's a five-cupper.

218
00:11:50,287 --> 00:11:55,680
Nevertheless, there is a theoretical
fifth cup out there.

219
00:11:55,887 --> 00:11:59,800
Now, I'm going to put ego aside.
This is strictly about self-improvement.

220
00:11:59,967 --> 00:12:04,165
My commitment to sexcellence,
if you will.

221
00:12:05,167 --> 00:12:08,125
- You just lost a cup.
- Oh, please, Roz.

222
00:12:09,647 --> 00:12:11,877
All right. Um...

223

[CHUCKLES]

224
00:12:14,647 --> 00:12:16,683
You know that thing
you did at the end?

225
00:12:16,847 --> 00:12:19,725
- At the very end?
- Just before.

226
00:12:19,887 --> 00:12:23,596
- I know exactly what you mean.
- I could have done without that.

227
00:12:25,487 --> 00:12:27,079
Really?

228
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:30,284
You didn't like that? Hm.
Well, maybe that's just your taste.

229
00:12:30,447 --> 00:12:31,846
- No.
- Oh.

230
00:12:32,367 --> 00:12:34,437
Because I've received high kudos
for that in the past.

231
00:12:34,607 --> 00:12:36,165
No, look, don't take it personally.

232
00:12:36,327 --> 00:12:38,238
It would have been impossible
for either one of us

233
00:12:38,407 --> 00:12:40,841
to get a perfect score that night,
given the circumstances.

234
00:12:41,007 --> 00:12:44,238
We were both tentative,
more than a little vulnerable.

235
00:12:44,447 --> 00:12:46,961
- That's true.
- And it was tough to concentrate

236
00:12:47,127 --> 00:12:50,164
with the TV blaring away
in your dad's bedroom.

237
00:12:50,887 --> 00:12:52,115
I didn't hear that.

238
00:12:52,327 --> 00:12:55,319
Don't you remember?
Sting was on Letterman.

239
00:12:58,367 --> 00:13:00,005
He was talking about the rain forest

240
00:13:00,167 --> 00:13:02,283
and the plight
of the Yanomama Indians.

241
00:13:03,767 --> 00:13:05,359
It was really sad.

242
00:13:05,527 --> 00:13:09,281
I mean, the whole Orinoco River Valley
is being forested into extinction.

243
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:16,042
Well, I'm glad
my woefully inadequate performance

244
00:13:16,207 --> 00:13:18,801
didn't distract you
from your ecology lesson.

245
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:23,039
Did Sting happen to mention anything
about you shaving your legs?

246
00:13:25,327 --> 00:13:27,557
Because that's a rain forest
that could use some pruning.

- At a soccer riot.

She stopped a Spanish bloke
from smashing a chair over my head.

He wasn't Spanish,
he was Portuguese.

- Well, I believe I know the difference

Great. I cheated death in Korea
for this.

- Is Daphne here?

308
00:16:55,367 --> 00:16:57,278
No, she's not back
from taking her mother home yet.

309
00:16:57,447 --> 00:17:00,200
Oh, well, I was hoping
to see her before I left.

310
00:17:00,367 --> 00:17:03,086
- I guess I'll leave her a note then.
- Uh, Mr. Moon.

I'm sorry I dragged you
all the way to America.

312
00:17:05,567 --> 00:17:10,402
Oh, it wasn't all that bad. I got to see
Daphne. And that hotel was brilliant.

313
00:17:10,927 --> 00:17:14,715
The towels were so fluffy,
I could barely close my suitcase.

314
00:17:18,327 --> 00:17:22,878
- Niles, I'm sorry things didn't work out.
- Well, we can't say you didn't try.

Well, uh, Dad, uh, why don't we
go to your bedroom?

I wanna show you how to use
your closed captioning on the TV

00:17:34,447 --> 00:17:36,358
so you don't have to have it on
so loud at night.

He's just leaving you a note.

How's your mom?

322
00:17:43,487 --> 00:17:45,478
Apparently there's nothing
left for her in England,

323
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:48,764
so she's thinking
about putting down roots here.

324
00:17:49,287 --> 00:17:51,323
Daphne,
from the bottom of my heart...

325
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:55,560
Niles, it's been a very trying day.
Could we talk about this later?

326
00:17:55,727 --> 00:18:00,039
I'll drive Daddy to the airport.
I'll move his suitcase to your car.

327
00:18:00,247 --> 00:18:04,035
There you are.
Well, back to England then.

328
00:18:04,207 --> 00:18:07,438
Yes. No chance of you and Mum
getting back together?

00:18:07,647 --> 00:18:09,763
Don't think so, love. Not this time.

- Maybe if you give it another chance.
- Daphne, I'm sorry. It's over.

00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:19,000
Has been for a long time.
I mean, I've got no complaints.

332
00:18:19,167 --> 00:18:21,727
I got something
wonderful out of it. You.

334
00:18:23,407 --> 00:18:26,763
Oh, Dad.
If you didn't love each other,

335
00:18:26,927 --> 00:18:29,202
why did you stay together
for 40 years?

336
00:18:29,367 --> 00:18:32,120
Through all the fighting
and the screaming and the hitting?

337
00:18:32,287 --> 00:18:34,005
That was for you kids.

338
00:18:35,807 --> 00:18:38,037
I can't believe this is really happening.

339
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:41,563
Maybe I'm naive, but I always
thought love would save the day.

340
00:18:41,767 --> 00:18:43,758
Well, you know, we all think
that when we're young,

341
00:18:43,927 --> 00:18:45,519
but then life beats us around a bit

342
00:18:45,687 --> 00:18:48,121
and you learn to dream
a little smaller.

343
00:18:48,287 --> 00:18:51,245
So that's how it goes.
Two people get married,

344
00:18:51,407 --> 00:18:54,763
they're together 40 years,
and then all of a sudden it just ends.

345
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:58,642
But it's different for you.
I mean, you've found the right person.

346
00:18:58,847 --> 00:19:00,997
- You barely know him.
- Well, all I know is

347
00:19:01,167 --> 00:19:03,886
I threw him out of my pub six times,
and six times he marched back in

348
00:19:04,047 --> 00:19:05,446
and yammered my ear off until...

349
00:19:05,607 --> 00:19:07,245
Until I went back with him
to America.

00:19:07,407 --> 00:19:12,037
All to make you happy. I never
did anything like that for your mother.

351
00:19:12,247 --> 00:19:15,319
No, no. I tell you, Daphne,
you've got a right one there,

352
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:19,321
A good one, you know. And another
thing, he's worth a bob or two.

353
00:19:20,087 --> 00:19:21,839
- Oh, Dad.
- Ha, ha, sweetie.

Because you'd do anything,

even put up with my insane family,
to make me happy.
