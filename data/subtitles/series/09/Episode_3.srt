1
00:00:08,007 --> 00:00:10,282
Terrance, we're nearing the end
of our programme,

2
00:00:10,447 --> 00:00:12,483
and we haven't gotten
to the heart of your problem.

3
00:00:12,647 --> 00:00:15,081
TERRANCE [ON PHONE]:
<i>I guess I'm just sick of being single.</i>

4
00:00:15,247 --> 00:00:17,636
<i>I mean, I'm almost 40.</i>
<i>What kind of loser am I?</i>

5
00:00:17,807 --> 00:00:20,275
A single man in his 40s
is not a loser.

6
00:00:20,447 --> 00:00:23,996
TERRANCE: <i>I said I'm almost 40.</i>
<i>Don't make it sound worse than it is.</i>

7
00:00:24,487 --> 00:00:26,557
- Can I jump in here, Frasier?
- Please.

8
00:00:26,727 --> 00:00:30,083
Listen, Terrance, I know that I'm not
as old as you, or Frasier,

9
00:00:30,247 --> 00:00:34,081
but I've been through
plenty of heartache and loneliness.

10
00:00:34,247 --> 00:00:37,125
I remember thinking,
"Love is never gonna come to me."

11
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:38,481
So I gave up.

12
00:00:38,647 --> 00:00:42,560
And that is when a handsome,
sweet-hearted man named Roger

13
00:00:42,727 --> 00:00:46,561
jumped off his garbage truck
and into my life.

14
00:00:46,727 --> 00:00:48,763
And I have been deliriously happy
ever since.

15
00:00:48,927 --> 00:00:51,725
And I feel sure that the same thing
will happen for you.

16
00:00:51,887 --> 00:00:53,525
TERRANCE:
<i>I have to give up on love first?</i>

17
00:00:53,687 --> 00:00:55,359
No, I'm saying don't give up.

18
00:00:55,527 --> 00:00:58,280
TERRANCE: <i>But you said you met</i>
<i>this garbage man after you gave up.</i>

19
00:00:58,447 --> 00:01:00,517
Terrance, I think what Roz
is trying to say

20
00:01:00,687 --> 00:01:03,281
is that whether
we seek love or not,

21
00:01:03,447 --> 00:01:07,122
we are always at the mercy
of its mysterious rhythm.

22
00:01:07,287 --> 00:01:10,563
- Exactly.
TERRANCE: <i>That's not what she said.</i>

23
00:01:11,327 --> 00:01:13,921
I think we know why this guy's
still single.

24
00:01:14,087 --> 00:01:17,045
This is Dr. Frasier Crane
saying good day, Seattle,

25
00:01:17,207 --> 00:01:19,641
and good mental health.

26
00:01:21,127 --> 00:01:23,163
- Your dad called during the segment.
- Oh, great.

27
00:01:23,327 --> 00:01:24,760
- Here's the number.
- Thank you.

28
00:01:24,927 --> 00:01:26,326
He's working
the early shift today.

29
00:01:26,487 --> 00:01:28,239
We're gonna have dinner together
this evening.

30
00:01:28,407 --> 00:01:30,079
Oh, I'm going out to dinner too.

31
00:01:30,247 --> 00:01:32,158
Yes. With Roger.
You mentioned that.

32
00:01:32,327 --> 00:01:34,363
Did I tell you he's taking me
on a moonlight picnic?

33
00:01:34,527 --> 00:01:35,516
Yes, you did.

34
00:01:35,687 --> 00:01:37,518
- In a canoe?
- Check.

35
00:01:37,687 --> 00:01:39,837
How romantic is that?

36
00:01:40,007 --> 00:01:44,000
He said all I had to bring was
my appetite for caviar and affection.

37
00:01:44,167 --> 00:01:46,920
I told him to bring his appetite
because I'll be wearing my edible...

38
00:01:47,087 --> 00:01:52,161
Dad. Hi. Yeah, uh, listen, um,
I've made our reservation for, uh...?

39
00:01:52,367 --> 00:01:55,325
- Oh.
- Sorry, Roz. Yes. Thanks.

40
00:01:57,647 --> 00:01:59,922
Yes, hello, is Martin Crane there,
please?

41
00:02:01,007 --> 00:02:03,316
Dad, hi. Look, I made a reservation
for, uh, 7:30,

44
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:08,806
Oh, dear.

45
00:02:09,367 --> 00:02:10,561
Hey, you know what?

46
00:02:10,727 --> 00:02:12,797
Why don't I stop by with a pizza?

47
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:15,765
Okay, great. I'll see you then.
Bye.

48
00:02:17,047 --> 00:02:18,639
More flowers from Roger.

49
00:02:18,807 --> 00:02:20,877
And you have to hear this poem
he wrote me.

50
00:02:21,047 --> 00:02:22,605
Hang on a second, Dad.
I, uh...

51
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:24,485
I've gotta get a pen.
I'll write that down.

52
00:02:24,647 --> 00:02:26,638
Sorry, Roz.

53
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:34,476
Good night, Marty.

54
00:02:34,847 --> 00:02:36,758
See you tomorrow, Babs.

55
00:02:38,967 --> 00:02:41,481
- Hey, mister. Pizza delivery.
- Hey, you made it.

56
00:02:41,647 --> 00:02:43,285
Oh, that smells good.

57
00:02:43,447 --> 00:02:44,596
What kind did you get?

58
00:02:44,887 --> 00:02:46,366
Prosciutto and fontina.

59
00:02:46,527 --> 00:02:49,087
Oh, I had my heart set
on a ham-and-cheeser.

60
00:02:49,247 --> 00:02:53,320
Oh, you were just messing with me.
Good one, Fras.

61
00:02:53,487 --> 00:02:55,079
FRASIER: There you are.
MARTIN: Ha-ha-ha.

62
00:02:55,287 --> 00:02:57,198
- Uh-oh. My boss is coming.
- Where?

63
00:02:57,367 --> 00:02:58,880
I can see him on the monitors.

64
00:02:59,047 --> 00:03:00,036
I'd love to meet him.

65
00:03:00,207 --> 00:03:03,040
How many times do I have to tell you
to stay off this damn frequency?

66
00:03:03,207 --> 00:03:06,165
Uh, maybe you could just go
read the directory for a minute.

67
00:03:07,087 --> 00:03:08,076
Uh-uh.

68
00:03:08,247 --> 00:03:11,319
- Food has to stay out of sight, Crane.
- Oh, right.

69
00:03:11,487 --> 00:03:14,047
- Oh, I'll take a slice though.
- Oh, sure.

70
00:03:14,367 --> 00:03:17,404
Hey, did you notice anyone
messing with the camera

71
00:03:17,567 --> 00:03:18,636
in the East Tower?

72
00:03:18,807 --> 00:03:21,799
That was me. The way it was pointed,
you couldn't really see the stairs.

73
00:03:21,967 --> 00:03:23,446
So you left your post?

74
00:03:23,607 --> 00:03:26,758
- I thought that it made more sense...
- We don't pay you to think, Crane.

75
00:03:26,927 --> 00:03:29,964
We pay you to watch the monitors
and keep the sign-in sheet in order.

76
00:03:30,687 --> 00:03:33,759
We also pay you to button
the top button on your shirt.

77
00:03:33,927 --> 00:03:34,916
See you tomorrow, fellas.

78
00:03:35,407 --> 00:03:37,602
- Good night.
- Good night, now.

79
00:03:38,647 --> 00:03:39,762
Maybe when you were a cop,

80
00:03:39,927 --> 00:03:42,157
you could play fast and loose
with the rules.

81
00:03:42,327 --> 00:03:43,680
But here at Keckner Security,

82
00:03:43,847 --> 00:03:45,644
regulations have to be followed.

83
00:03:45,807 --> 00:03:48,321
Yes, sir. Do you want to look over
the sign-in sheet?

84
00:03:48,487 --> 00:03:49,681
Do you need any help?

85
00:03:49,887 --> 00:03:52,765
Oh. Uh, I'm... I'm sorry, no.
No, thank you.

86
00:03:52,927 --> 00:03:55,236
You hate to ask for help, huh?

87
00:03:55,407 --> 00:03:58,319
You know what people
who never ask questions never get?

88
00:03:58,807 --> 00:03:59,796
Answers.

89
00:03:59,967 --> 00:04:01,559
[CHUCKLES]

90
00:04:02,247 --> 00:04:04,124
Very interesting. Yes, uh...

91
00:04:04,927 --> 00:04:07,725
Oh, there it is.
Uh, UCB Industries.

92
00:04:07,887 --> 00:04:09,923
- You're a UCB man?
- Yes.

93
00:04:10,087 --> 00:04:12,043
- I'm with DNR Associates.
- Ah.

94
00:04:12,207 --> 00:04:15,597
So I guess, uh, technically,
we shouldn't be talking, but, uh,

95
00:04:15,767 --> 00:04:18,725
who takes that corporate competition
stuff seriously anymore?

96
00:04:19,007 --> 00:04:20,360
I do.

97
00:04:21,607 --> 00:04:22,676
Ah.

98
00:04:22,847 --> 00:04:26,760
Look, Crane, you really want to put
that busy brain of yours to work,

99
00:04:26,927 --> 00:04:31,079
why don't you mastermind a way
to lift the pizza stain out of your tie?

100
00:04:35,207 --> 00:04:37,038
I can't believe the way
that guy talked to you.

101
00:04:37,207 --> 00:04:39,516
Oh, it's no big deal.
Why don't you just go home?

102
00:04:39,727 --> 00:04:42,116
- But he has no right to do that.
- Just go home.

103
00:04:43,327 --> 00:04:44,726
All right.

104
00:04:45,127 --> 00:04:47,118
- I'll see you there.
MARTIN: Okay.

105
00:04:51,847 --> 00:04:53,075
Well,

106
00:04:54,087 --> 00:04:55,839
this is awkward.

107
00:04:57,087 --> 00:05:00,841
Especially with the, uh, Reliance
Bearings account up for grabs.

108
00:05:01,007 --> 00:05:02,486
But whoever wins it, wins it.

109
00:05:02,647 --> 00:05:04,046
Good luck.

110
00:05:04,527 --> 00:05:07,041
Don't you mean
congratulations?

111
00:05:08,447 --> 00:05:10,915
- You're kidding.
- An hour ago.

112
00:05:11,087 --> 00:05:13,885
Don't they ever cc
you guys on this stuff?

113
00:05:23,367 --> 00:05:24,561
NILES:
You're not exaggerating?

114
00:05:24,727 --> 00:05:27,195
I tell you, Niles,
I stood there slack-jawed

115
00:05:27,367 --> 00:05:29,961
as Dad was reprimanded
like an errant child.

116
00:05:30,127 --> 00:05:31,560
Maybe his boss
was having a tough day

117
00:05:31,727 --> 00:05:33,240
and needed someone
to take it out on.

118
00:05:33,407 --> 00:05:36,797
Sometimes an employer gets
so caught up in his own world that he...

119
00:05:36,967 --> 00:05:38,480
I mean, after all, this is a man

120
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:41,520
who served his country in Korea,

121
00:05:41,687 --> 00:05:43,439
who had a distinguished career
as a detective,

122
00:05:43,607 --> 00:05:46,997
and yet he is being treated the way you
would treat a grocery-store bag boy.

123
00:05:47,167 --> 00:05:48,885
What does that mean?

124
00:05:49,047 --> 00:05:51,038
Don't play coy with me
just because Daphne's here.

125
00:05:51,207 --> 00:05:55,280
I have seen you when your avocados
are packed under your ice cream.

126
00:05:55,887 --> 00:05:57,878
Excuse me.
That young man was on drugs,

127
00:05:58,047 --> 00:06:00,083
and everyone in the store knew it.

128
00:06:02,247 --> 00:06:03,475
MARTIN: Hey.
NILES: Hey, Dad.

129
00:06:03,647 --> 00:06:05,444
FRASIER: Dad.
- Mr. Crane. How was work today?

130
00:06:05,607 --> 00:06:07,563
Oh, same old, same old.

131
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:11,077
Boy, I'm beat.

132
00:06:11,727 --> 00:06:14,241
Eight hours of staring
at those monitors

133
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:17,399
can really wear you out. Ah.

134
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:24,120
So, Dad, did you speak
with your supervisor?

135
00:06:24,287 --> 00:06:26,278
Oh, don't start this again.
Everything's fine.

136
00:06:26,447 --> 00:06:28,244
Dad, after the way
that man eviscerated you?

137
00:06:28,407 --> 00:06:30,523
That's just Rich.
He's one of those tough guys.

138
00:06:30,687 --> 00:06:32,200
It's no big deal.

139
00:06:32,367 --> 00:06:34,437
You're a tough guy.
Why don't you set him straight?

140
00:06:34,607 --> 00:06:36,245
I'm not gonna talk back to my boss.

141
00:06:36,407 --> 00:06:38,284
You have to respect
the chain of command.

142
00:06:38,447 --> 00:06:40,756
It's not easy, but that's the way
I've always done it.

143
00:06:40,927 --> 00:06:43,646
- So you're gonna sit there and take it?
- Come on, Fras. We're men.

144
00:06:43,807 --> 00:06:45,320
We know how to gut these things out.

145
00:06:45,487 --> 00:06:47,239
We don't whine and cry.
You know that.

146
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:48,760
Ha!

147
00:06:50,527 --> 00:06:52,358
How true.

148
00:06:54,807 --> 00:06:57,196
You do know that, Dr. Crane.

149
00:06:57,727 --> 00:06:59,080
I'll bet the owner of the company

150
00:06:59,247 --> 00:07:01,203
would like to know
how this Rich is behaving.

151
00:07:01,407 --> 00:07:03,159
The owner of the company
is Rich's son.

152
00:07:03,327 --> 00:07:06,558
Nepotism, huh? God, this problem
just keeps getting bigger and bigger.

153
00:07:06,767 --> 00:07:08,200
- It's not a problem.
- Dad...

154
00:07:08,367 --> 00:07:11,245
Frasier, would you listen?
He said it's not a problem.

155
00:07:11,407 --> 00:07:13,284
Dad's more than capable
of handling himself.

156
00:07:13,447 --> 00:07:15,802
- Thank you.
- You see? He thinks you're out of line.

157
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:18,003
- No, I just...
- No, Dad, Dad, I got this.

158
00:07:19,047 --> 00:07:21,880
You've gotta have at least
some kind of plan to deal with this guy.

159
00:07:22,047 --> 00:07:24,925
I've got a plan. Once Rich knows
I'm not fighting, he'll drop it.

160
00:07:25,087 --> 00:07:28,124
Which is what you guys are gonna do.
Now I'm tired of talking about this.

161
00:07:28,287 --> 00:07:30,084
See? Now you've made Dad tired.

162
00:07:30,247 --> 00:07:33,159
- Can it, Niles.
- And cranky.

163
00:07:36,327 --> 00:07:37,442
[CHATTERING]

164
00:07:37,607 --> 00:07:39,120
- Frasier Crane, right?
- Ah, yes, yes.

165
00:07:39,287 --> 00:07:40,845
I'm Charlie Keckner
of Keckner Security.

166
00:07:41,007 --> 00:07:42,838
Mr. Keckner, nice to meet you.
Please sit down.

167
00:07:43,007 --> 00:07:45,202
- Would you like some coffee?
- Nothing for me, thanks.

168
00:07:45,367 --> 00:07:47,756
- Thank you for meeting me like this.
- No problem.

169
00:07:47,927 --> 00:07:51,283
I like face-to-facing with new clients,
especially those in the public eye

170
00:07:51,447 --> 00:07:55,235
who need the kind of custom-tailored
security that we specialise in.

171
00:07:55,407 --> 00:07:56,806
So,

172
00:07:57,127 --> 00:07:59,004
what is it? Stalker, blackmailer,

173
00:07:59,167 --> 00:08:01,044
random nut job?

174
00:08:02,567 --> 00:08:05,525
I'm sorry, but I'm not actually

175
00:08:06,047 --> 00:08:08,481
in the market
for security services.

176
00:08:08,687 --> 00:08:10,279
Oh, that's strange.

177
00:08:10,447 --> 00:08:11,926
Because
your phone message said:

178
00:08:12,087 --> 00:08:13,725
"I'm in the market
for security services."

179
00:08:13,887 --> 00:08:17,436
Yes, I can see how that
may have been misleading. I, uh...

180
00:08:17,887 --> 00:08:19,286
I wanted to meet you in person

181
00:08:19,447 --> 00:08:23,042
because I have, uh, a matter
of some delicacy to discuss with you.

182
00:08:23,527 --> 00:08:26,599
My father works for your company, and
I understand your father does as well.

183
00:08:26,807 --> 00:08:28,365
What does this have to do
with anything?

184
00:08:28,527 --> 00:08:32,600
Well, it seems that...

185
00:08:33,927 --> 00:08:36,395
...your dad has been
picking on my dad.

186
00:08:39,647 --> 00:08:40,841
What?

187
00:08:41,007 --> 00:08:42,599
That doesn't sound like my dad.

188
00:08:42,767 --> 00:08:45,361
Well, perhaps you don't know your dad
as well as you think you do.

189
00:08:45,527 --> 00:08:47,245
I saw the whole thing.

190
00:08:47,687 --> 00:08:50,759
Well, huh, maybe my dad
was just defending himself.

191
00:08:50,927 --> 00:08:52,406
Did your dad provoke him?

192
00:08:52,567 --> 00:08:56,276
No, no. I can assure you
that your dad started it.

193
00:08:57,487 --> 00:09:00,126
None of the other guards
has any trouble with my dad.

194
00:09:00,287 --> 00:09:02,005
Maybe your dad
needs to toughen up a little.

195
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:03,646
My father fought in Korea.

196
00:09:03,807 --> 00:09:06,401
Did he? Or did you
fight the Koreans for him?

197
00:09:09,207 --> 00:09:14,361
Now, Charlie, I'm sure a man
of your inspired leadership

198
00:09:14,527 --> 00:09:17,405
has resolved conflicts
between employees before.

199
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,636
- Hmm?
- Sure.

200
00:09:18,807 --> 00:09:21,401
It's that kind of
enlightened management

201
00:09:21,567 --> 00:09:24,798
that has made the name Keckner
synonymous with security.

202
00:09:26,007 --> 00:09:28,396
- All right, I'll look into it.
- Thank you so much.

203
00:09:28,567 --> 00:09:30,922
If you don't mind, could we keep
this meeting between us?

204
00:09:31,087 --> 00:09:33,442
I'd hate to have my father think
I went behind his back.

205
00:09:33,607 --> 00:09:36,599
You're asking me to conceal
something from my own father?

206
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,485
I don't know if I can do that.

207
00:09:38,647 --> 00:09:41,207
On the other hand,
if you were a client,

208
00:09:41,367 --> 00:09:44,325
I'd be obligated
to keep this confidential.

209
00:09:45,487 --> 00:09:48,320
If you're implying what I think you are,
Mr. Keckner,

210
00:09:48,487 --> 00:09:51,479
I hope for your sake
you brought some brochures.

211
00:09:51,647 --> 00:09:53,046
Please.

212
00:09:58,127 --> 00:10:00,516
All right. Good night.

213
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:04,240
- Hey, Rich.
- Hey, buddy.

214
00:10:04,407 --> 00:10:06,967
- Everything all right here?
- Uh, sure.

215
00:10:07,727 --> 00:10:09,604
Nothing to complain about, then?

216
00:10:10,447 --> 00:10:13,120
No. Want some coffee?

217
00:10:13,567 --> 00:10:16,525
No, no, no. I keep my eating
and drinking to the break room.

218
00:10:16,687 --> 00:10:19,679
That way nobody complains.

219
00:10:19,847 --> 00:10:22,077
Oh. Okay.

220
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:24,886
Uh, I could use your initials
on my time card, if you've got a sec.

221
00:10:25,047 --> 00:10:27,607
Oh, for you, I've got all night.

222
00:10:27,767 --> 00:10:29,359
And I'll be sure to do it neatly

223
00:10:29,527 --> 00:10:32,644
so there'll be no complaints.

224
00:10:33,847 --> 00:10:35,121
Okay, what's going on?

225
00:10:35,287 --> 00:10:36,515
You tell me.

226
00:10:36,687 --> 00:10:39,326
My son chewed me out
for being too tough on the guards.

227
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:41,205
I wonder who might have put him up
to that.

228
00:10:41,367 --> 00:10:44,564
- It could have been any of the guys.
- I think it was you.

229
00:10:45,807 --> 00:10:48,367
- It wasn't me. I'm not a complainer.
- Good.

230
00:10:48,527 --> 00:10:51,485
Then you won't complain about doing
a few graveyard shifts next week.

231
00:10:51,927 --> 00:10:53,565
- No problem.
- Good.

232
00:10:53,727 --> 00:10:56,116
How's Tuesday, Wednesday
work for you?

233
00:10:56,967 --> 00:10:59,527
- Actually, that's not so good.
- Oh.

234
00:10:59,687 --> 00:11:01,996
Then how's Tuesday, Wednesday,
Thursday, Friday?

235
00:11:03,887 --> 00:11:05,366
Better.

236
00:11:09,607 --> 00:11:10,960
Hey, Niles.

237
00:11:11,127 --> 00:11:12,526
- Hey, Daphne.
- Hi, Roz.

238
00:11:12,687 --> 00:11:14,405
I called you this morning.
Where were you?

239
00:11:14,567 --> 00:11:16,762
Sleeping. Mr. Crane's
been working the overnight shift.

240
00:11:16,927 --> 00:11:18,406
It's thrown my whole schedule off.

241
00:11:18,567 --> 00:11:21,923
Oh. Roger and I have been working
overnight too, if you know what I mean.

242
00:11:22,407 --> 00:11:24,477
Let me grab a muffin
and I'll tell you all about it.

243
00:11:24,647 --> 00:11:25,966
- Grab one for me too.
- Okay.

244
00:11:26,487 --> 00:11:28,478
So I can stick it in my ears.

245
00:11:29,527 --> 00:11:31,119
I'm a little tired of hearing about it.

246
00:11:31,287 --> 00:11:33,960
You're tired? I've heard double
whatever you have.

247
00:11:34,127 --> 00:11:38,643
Did you know Roger wrote her a song
to the tune of "I Believe I Can Fly"?

248
00:11:39,807 --> 00:11:41,843
I do now, don't I?

249
00:11:42,007 --> 00:11:44,601
Look, let's just not talk about Roger
this one time, okay?

250
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:47,156
That's impossible.
She brings everything back to him.

251
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:49,716
- Well, just leave it to me.
- Oh, good luck.

252
00:11:50,367 --> 00:11:51,766
So, what are you guys
talking about?

253
00:11:51,927 --> 00:11:55,397
Um, mediaeval French history.

254
00:11:56,207 --> 00:11:58,801
- I've always wanted to see Paris.
- Mm-hm. Thank you.

255
00:11:58,967 --> 00:12:01,276
Roger says he's gonna take me there
someday.

256
00:12:01,447 --> 00:12:03,039
He says you haven't truly
made love...

257
00:12:03,207 --> 00:12:05,402
- Oh, look at this.
- What?

258
00:12:05,567 --> 00:12:08,081
It says interest rates
might go down again.

259
00:12:08,247 --> 00:12:11,557
Just when we thought the interest
couldn't get any lower.

260
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:16,883
I don't know about interest rates
and all that garbage. Oops.

261
00:12:17,527 --> 00:12:19,119
It's a good thing
Roger didn't hear that.

262
00:12:19,287 --> 00:12:21,403
He doesn't like it when I use garbage
in a derogatory way.

263
00:12:21,567 --> 00:12:24,525
Of course, he always forgives me.
Isn't he a doll?

264
00:12:24,687 --> 00:12:26,678
Oh, you know, speaking of dolls,

265
00:12:26,847 --> 00:12:28,439
I understand
the Nordic Heritage Museum

266
00:12:28,607 --> 00:12:30,882
is planning a huge retrospective

267
00:12:31,047 --> 00:12:33,800
of Icelandic dolls
of the 19th century.

268
00:12:34,207 --> 00:12:37,438
Hmm. Is the Nordic Museum
the one near Sunset Hill?

269
00:12:37,607 --> 00:12:39,438
Roger and I had the best
bottle of wine there...

270
00:12:39,607 --> 00:12:40,801
NILES:
No.

271
00:12:41,887 --> 00:12:44,082
The Nordic Museum
is in Ballard.

272
00:12:46,327 --> 00:12:48,716
Oh, I guess I don't know
that place after all.

273
00:12:48,887 --> 00:12:52,118
Hmm. That exhibit sounds
fascinating, Niles. When is it?

274
00:12:52,287 --> 00:12:54,676
- February 14th.
- Valentine's Day?

275
00:12:55,367 --> 00:12:58,404
I guess I won't be there. Roger and I
are spending the whole day together.

276
00:12:58,567 --> 00:13:00,603
He says it's going to be full
of romantic surprises.

277
00:13:00,767 --> 00:13:02,997
But he gives me a romantic surprise
every single day.

278
00:13:03,167 --> 00:13:05,158
- This morning...
- I know girl talk when I hear it.

279
00:13:05,327 --> 00:13:06,840
Excuse me.

280
00:13:08,567 --> 00:13:11,206
Girl talk? He's the one
going to a doll museum.

281
00:13:12,887 --> 00:13:15,606
- Forget your coffee. Let's get out.
- What? And leave Daphne?

282
00:13:15,927 --> 00:13:18,282
It's too late for her.
We have to keep moving.

283
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:22,083
Niles, I can't. I'm meeting Dad here
in a few minutes.

284
00:13:22,247 --> 00:13:24,920
His schedule's been so topsy-turvy
I haven't seen him in days.

285
00:13:25,087 --> 00:13:26,679
Still having trouble
with his supervisor?

286
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:27,996
Well, yes.

287
00:13:28,167 --> 00:13:31,557
Yes, but I believe we'll be hearing
some good news on that front,

288
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:33,479
no thanks to you.

289
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:34,682
What does that mean?

290
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:37,077
Let's just say
I took appropriate action.

291
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:39,239
After Dad asked you
to butt out?

292
00:13:39,407 --> 00:13:41,363
If you had seen the way
this man treated Dad,

293
00:13:41,527 --> 00:13:43,677
I swear to God, you would have
done the same thing.

294
00:13:43,847 --> 00:13:44,882
- Perhaps.
- Thank you.

295
00:13:45,047 --> 00:13:48,722
I just wonder if you're doing this
for Dad or for yourself.

296
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:51,361
- What are you on about now?
- Well, I just think it's telling

297
00:13:51,527 --> 00:13:54,360
that the whole thing bothers you
a lot more than it bothers Dad.

298
00:13:54,527 --> 00:13:56,757
You can't stand to see him
being bossed

299
00:13:56,927 --> 00:13:59,441
because to you, he's always been
this larger-than-life figure.

300
00:13:59,607 --> 00:14:02,121
And you're desperate
to keep that image intact.

301
00:14:03,727 --> 00:14:05,001
More importantly,

302
00:14:05,167 --> 00:14:07,078
why is that man staring at us?

303
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:11,398
That's Sanchez, my bodyguard.

304
00:14:16,327 --> 00:14:19,524
It's only on a trial basis.
It's a long story.

305
00:14:19,687 --> 00:14:21,803
Oh, Dad. How you doing?

306
00:14:21,967 --> 00:14:23,878

that's how I'm doing.

307

I just got beeped.
Rich wants me to work tonight.

308
00:14:28,927 --> 00:14:30,997
I'm gonna have to cancel
our dinner.

309

- You haven't had a day off.
- I know.

310
00:14:33,087 --> 00:14:35,203
He thinks I went over his head
to complain about him,

311
00:14:35,367 --> 00:14:37,403
so now he's really
turning up the heat.

312
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,636
No kidding.

313
00:14:38,807 --> 00:14:41,082
As if things weren't bad enough
for you already, Dad.

314
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:42,521
MARTIN:
Yeah, I know.

315
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:45,042
I used to take pride working through
tough spots like this,

316
00:14:45,207 --> 00:14:47,084
but I don't know if it's worth it
this time.

317
00:14:47,247 --> 00:14:49,442
- Dad, I'm so sorry.
- Oh, it's nobody's fault.

318
00:14:49,607 --> 00:14:51,563
I'm just getting too old
for this sort of stuff.

319
00:14:51,727 --> 00:14:53,763
And if he keeps up with it,
I'm gonna call it quits.

320
00:14:53,927 --> 00:14:56,805
But that's a horrible idea. You can't run
from these kinds of problems.

I guess there's only
one option left.

329

- Tell Dad the truth.
- All right, two options.

330

- I gotta go and speak directly to Rich.
- Don't you ever learn?

331

He needs to know that Dad
is not the one who complained.

on Dad for doing the very same thing.

Okay, come down

- Yes, yes, you're right.

Let me ask you something.

349
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:19,206
Do they pay you
to fix the elevator

350
00:16:19,367 --> 00:16:22,518
or just spread your tools
all over my lobby?

You ever hear of putting down
a drop cloth?

352
00:16:25,647 --> 00:16:28,115
By letting Dad handle this himself,
you'd be empowering him.

And isn't that really
the greatest gift of all?
