1
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:12,114
Oh, my God. Breathtaking.

2
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:15,068
Well, don't be greedy.
Your turn was over 40 seconds ago.

3
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:18,507
All right, all right, Niles.
There it is. It's the penthouse unit.

4
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,801
- Second window from the right.
- Uh-huh, uh-huh.

5
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:23,580
Oh, mama.

6
00:00:24,065 --> 00:00:26,340
You two know that what
you're doing isn't right, don't you?

7
00:00:26,651 --> 00:00:30,121
We're simply admiring a rare Brancusi
armchair, not a naked woman.

8
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:32,164
That's what I'm talking about.

9
00:00:35,952 --> 00:00:37,465
- Oh, hi, Daph.
- Hello, Daphne.

10
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:39,976
- You're home kind of early, aren't you?
- A bit.

11
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:42,603
- Something sort of happened.
- Oh, yeah? What?

12
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:45,629
Well, Joe and I were having dinner.

13
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,754
Everything was nice as could be,
and I said, "Don't you like your potato?"

14
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:52,651
And he said, "No, I'm not
hungry for potato just now."

15
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:56,325
I said, "If you don't like your potato,
you're welcome to try my potato."

16
00:00:56,639 --> 00:01:00,473
Daphne, could we hasten to the
post-potato portion of the dialogue?

17
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:04,059
Well, that's when he said it.

18
00:01:04,356 --> 00:01:06,586
He said we'd been on again,
off again for too long

19
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:08,371
without making anything permanent.

20
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,408
So maybe it was best
if we just broke up.

21
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:13,808
Oh, gosh. I'm sorry.

22
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:15,920
You're sure taking it well.

23
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:19,003
Boy, if you'd have told me that Joe
would end up dumping you--

24
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:21,763
Oh, God, he dumped me!

25
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:24,599
- Somebody comfort her.
- Right.

26
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:31,152
Oh, this is so embarrassing.

27
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:33,738
Oh, no, no.
Never mind about that.

28
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:36,361
Expressing our feelings
is always beneficial.

29
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:39,630
Even if it does come
at the expense of our pride.

30
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:44,574
And a very expensive
brand new Italian silk jacket.

31
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:48,461
I don't seem to be doing much good.
Why don't you give it a try?

32
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:51,050
Now, Daphne.

33
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:53,992
That's all right. You're better off
without him. That guy was a bum.

34
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:56,074
He was the best thing in my life.

35
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:59,600
Then maybe you two just weren't
meant for each other, you know.

36
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:03,790
You're a champagne-and-caviar sort
of gal. He's a meat-and-potatoes guy.

37
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:06,759
Potatoes.

38
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:09,076
- I'm messing up too.
- I've got it, Dad. Here.

39
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:11,532
I'll get it.

40
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:16,932
- Hey, Daphne.
- Roz.

41
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:20,613
Oh, my God. You got dumped.
Ahhh.

42
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:27,212
- Did you make her answer the door?
- It's what she does.

43
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:30,119
Oh, it's all right. Come on.

44
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,391
- I'm sorry about this.
- It's all right.

45
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:35,769
I guess I'm still at the point where
I can't hear his name without crying.

46
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:39,072
Did you hear that everyone?
No one mentions the name "Joe."

47
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:50,595
- Brandy, Niles?
- Yes, thank you.

48
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,319
- Frasier?
- Mm-hmm.

49
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:54,959
I think I've just made
an important decision.

50
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:57,172
I'm going to tell Daphne
how I feel about her.

51
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:59,145
- What?
- I'm gonna tell her tonight.

52
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:01,696
- You're serious?
- I am dead serious.

53
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:04,612
Maris and I are nowhere
near reconciling.

54
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:06,485
I know this is the right decision

55
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:08,844
because I'm completely calm
about it. Look.

56
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,391
- Perhaps I'll take that brandy.
- Yes, all right.

57
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:21,421
Niles, before you do something
this rash,

58
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,931
perhaps you should consider it
from all angles.

59
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:27,237
I've spent three years considering
Daphne from all angles.

60
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,700
I'm just not sure this is the right timing.

61
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:34,073
If you're trying to rattle me,
it's not going to work.

62
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:36,216
I've been rehearsing for months.
Daphne,

63
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:39,458
there's something I need
to talk to you about. It's a matter of...

64
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:41,672
Daphne,

65
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:45,445
for a long time now, I--
You and I-- We--

66
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:48,642
Exactly how's the brandy
getting here, by St. Bernard?

67
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:56,452
Niles, I just think you should
consider Daphne's state of mind.

68
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,886
I mean, she's still reeling
from her break-up with Joe.

69
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:01,836
Listen, why don't you just
give it one more day?

70
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:05,564
- A day?
- It's just a day. Just one day, please.

71
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:09,465
I mean, you've waited this long.
Another day won't make a difference.

72
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:12,979
All right.

73
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:17,087
Now Daphne, if the jewelry wasn't
that good and the sex wasn't that good,

74
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:20,143
what have you really lost here?

75
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:25,883
Dr. Roz weighs in with the
Gabor approach to therapy.

76
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:30,979
What were the Sonics
thinking last night?

77
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:34,187
If you're two for 15 behind the arc,
why do you give it to your two guard

78
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,958
instead of jamming it down
to your big man in the paint?

79
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:41,493
Eddie, I believe that question
was directed at you.

80
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:47,503
You know, if you took
an interest in sports,

81
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:51,666
I bet you'd end up enjoying it.
It's got drama, it's got graceful stuff.

82
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,675
Thank you, Dad, but I'm quite satisfied
with the likes of Pavarotti's <i>Pagliacci</i>.

83
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:58,564
You have your big man in the paint.
I have mine.

84
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:08,532
- Niles.
- Frasier.

85
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:11,307
Either your boutonniere's
way over the top,

86
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:14,029
or you're here to execute
last night's plan.

87
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:17,457
Look, I know I don't have
your total support in this,

88
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,884
- but how shall I put this?
- You don't care?

89
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:23,354
If you could work the phrase
"rat's ass" into there, you'd have it.

90
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,507
The fact is, I'm tired of being lonely,

91
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,384
and it makes no sense going on
being lonely

92
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:33,614
when the woman I long for
is unattached.

93
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:37,106
Yes, well, as I said the time
you tried to jump out of the tree house

94
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:40,810
with an umbrella, "I suppose
you know what you're doing."

95
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,536
- Hey, Niles.
- Hey, Dad.

96
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:48,218
Hello.
Oh, just a second, please.

97
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:50,668
- Dad, is Daphne in her room?
- Gee, I don't know.

98
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:53,084
Daphne! Hey, Daph! Daphne!

99
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,913
For God's sake, I can yell!

100
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:58,668
Would you hold, please?

101
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:01,987
Been waiting 30 years to do that.

102
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:06,297
You're probably wondering
what I'm doing with these flowers.

103
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:09,168
- Now that you mention it.
- Well, I'll tell you.

104
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:12,209
They're for Daphne.

105
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:14,411
I'm going to tell her how I feel about her.

106
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,896
- That's great, Niles.
- That's great?

107
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:19,477
- Well, yeah.
- You're single now. She's single.

108
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:20,982
What's the problem?

109
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:26,708
- That's so funny.
- What is?

110
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,123
That's just not
the reaction I expected.

111
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:32,028
I thought you'd say something
more Dad-like, like--

112
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:35,228
- You're out of your mind?
- Exactly.

113
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,511
She's never gonna go for it
in a million years.

114
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:39,536
Stop it. Stop it.

115
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:42,091
Some day you'll look back
on this as the stupidest--

116
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:44,005
I said stop it, Dad.

117
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:47,650
- Morning, Dr. Crane.
- Hello, Daphne.

118
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:50,341
Oh, don't you look nice.

119
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:53,166
Hello?

120
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:57,008
Yes, Rodney.
Well, I'm so glad you called.

121
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:59,370
Well, yes, I enjoyed meeting you too.

122
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:01,405
Uh-huh.

123
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:06,312
Well, that would be lovely.
I'll see you around 4 then. Bye.

124
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:10,582
- Rodney?
- Yes. You won't believe this.

125
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:14,768
Last night, Roz insisted on taking me
to this bar she calls the Sure Thing.

126
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:18,135
How flattering.
They've named a bar after her.

127
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:24,247
Well, she said whenever she
takes a friend there,

128
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:26,324
they always end up meeting someone.

129
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:29,131
Well, I wasn't there ten minutes
when she spun my barstool around

130
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:31,363
and I was face-to-face
with this nice-looking man.

131
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:32,892
- Rodney?
- Right.

132
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:36,942
I suppose it's a bit soon
for me to be seeing anyone else,

133
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:39,523
but if I wait, he might not be
available when I'm ready.

134
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:41,954
Timing is everything.

135
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:45,146
I can't wait to tell Roz.

136
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:49,427
"Give it a day, Niles."
I believe that was your brilliant advice.

137
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:53,962
I'm sorry, Niles. I really am.
I don't know what to say.

138
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,502
Too bad you didn't have
that problem last night.

139
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:58,918
Look, don't let it get you down.

140
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:01,860
I'm not going to.
I still have a fallback position.

141
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:05,394
I'm going to call Roz and have
her take me to that bar tonight.

142
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:09,990
Niles, really. A singles' bar?

143
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:14,316
Please, you're not thinking clearly.
It's not exactly your arena, is it?

144
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:17,255
Listen, why don't you just
give it a day and think it--

145
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:19,936
Here, let me dial that for you.

146
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:33,900
Well, I'm here.

147
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:36,053
I forgot to gargle, I'm wearing
mismatched socks

148
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:38,537
and I'm so nervous
I could wet myself.

149
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:43,079
Well, at least we have
your opening line down.

150
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:47,065
You're going to have to be patient
with me. This isn't exactly my milieu.

151
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,237
Okay, let's make that
lesson number one.

152
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:51,535
If you're going to use words like milieu,

153
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:56,059
you might as well show up here with
a sore on your lip and a couple of kids.

154
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:02,701
- Point well taken.
- Will you sit down and relax?

155
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:06,676
You're gonna be fine. Just a few
little rules you need to know.

156
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:10,315
First, when you introduce yourself,
be as casual as possible.

157
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:14,148
Second, you cannot say enough
nice things about her hair.

158
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:16,707
I know that sounds shallow,
but it really works.

159
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:20,249
And third, hang on her every word.

160
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,516
Be fascinated.

161
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:24,124
Now go.

162
00:09:24,356 --> 00:09:25,948
- What do you mean, go?
- It's time.

163
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:27,943
I'm not ready.

164
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:31,716
I've thrown a lot of babies in the water,
and they've all come up swimming.

165
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:34,385
- Now go.
- No, no, I couldn't possibly, not yet.

166
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:38,206
- I have-- Hello.
- Hello.

167
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,057
Hope I'm not bothering you.

168
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:43,837
- No, not at all. I'm Adelle.
- Niles.

169
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:46,723
So, Adelle,

170
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:49,919
- is that one L or two?
- Two.

171
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:52,345
Really?

172
00:10:05,397 --> 00:10:08,036
- You're wasting your time.
- No, I'm not.

173
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:09,635
You're not gonna win.

174
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:13,780
It's time he learned what it's like
to be stared at all the time.

175
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:17,712
Bring it on, buster. You got nothing.

176
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:20,719
You can't touch me. I'm--
Oh!

177
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:26,790
It's like his eye turned into a sorcerer's
pinwheels and started spinning.

178
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:31,305
Just shake hands
and say "Good fight."

179
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,171
- Hey, Dad.
- How you doing? Come on in.

180
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:39,897
Dad, this is Adelle Childs,
my father, Martin.

181
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:41,978
- Nice to meet you.
- My brother, Frasier.

182
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:44,819
- It's so nice to finally meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

183
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:47,620
- You all right? Your eyes look funny.
- I'm fine, I'm fine.

184
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:51,207
- Oh, listen, here are your tickets.
- Thank you.

185
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:53,801
Say, have you got time
for a coffee before you go?

186
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,708
- That'd be nice.
- Splendid.

187
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:58,461
It gives me a chance to debut
my Limoges coffee set...

188
00:10:58,742 --> 00:11:00,892
A series of six unique cups.

189
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:04,073
Each one representing
a different wife of Henry VIII.

190
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:11,001
My antique dealer just found an
Anne of Cleves to complete the set.

191
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:13,567
He loves to rub it in.

192
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:17,916
I'm still looking for Wilma
to complete my juice glass set.

193
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:22,815
I'll lend you a hand. Excuse me.

194
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:27,350
- So, what do you think?
- She seems very nice.

195
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:29,078
She's fabulous.

196
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:30,906
It's know it's only been three dates,

197
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:32,821
but I feel as though
I've been rescued.

198
00:11:33,068 --> 00:11:35,787
I no longer worry about
becoming one of those pitiful losers

199
00:11:36,071 --> 00:11:39,825
embittered by a failed marriage,
leading a lonely, pathetic life

200
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:43,320
of fulfillment and good times.

201
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:48,288
Shouldn't you make a beeping
noise when you back up like that?

202
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:52,842
- Coffee will be ready in a moment.
- What were you two whispering about?

203
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:54,923
Nothing.

204
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:57,892
Just how whenever you think
you have your life figured out,

205
00:11:58,176 --> 00:12:00,929
something unexpected happens.

206
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:04,160
Sorry. Forgot my keys.
Hello, all.

207
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:07,549
- Oh, everyone, this is Rodney Banks.
- Oh.

208
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:09,702
Hello.

209
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:11,537
- Dr. Niles Crane.
- How do you do?

210
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:13,684
The pleasure is mine.

211
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:22,765
- Flu season.
- Can't be too careful.

212
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:26,663
Oh, this is Dr. Frasier Crane
and his father, Martin.

213
00:12:26,997 --> 00:12:28,874
- Good to see you. Welcome.
- Hi, how are you?

214
00:12:29,124 --> 00:12:30,682
This is Adelle Childs.

215
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:32,396
- Hello.
- Hello.

216
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:34,936
Well, we've just had the most
wonderful day at the marina.

217
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:37,211
- Oh, you got a boat?
- Actually, no.

218
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:40,616
I have an inner ear curvature that
makes me prone to motion sickness.

219
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:43,487
But there's a charming bistro there
that serves the most--

220
00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:51,684
- It's not me.
- Not me.

221
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:54,611
Hello.
Oh, I can't talk now, Duke.

222
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:56,855
I'm in the <i>Twilight Zone</i>.

223
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:05,319
Would you like a coffee?

224
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:09,406
- Oh, yes, that would be lovely.
- I'll give you a hand, Frasier.

225
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:14,555
What the hell was that?

226
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,735
I think we should put a little red mark
on the real Niles

227
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:21,919
so we can tell them apart.

228
00:13:22,177 --> 00:13:23,735
Niles must be going nuts.

229
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:27,102
- Can I lend you a hand?
- Oh, no, that's fine, Niles.

230
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:31,303
Oh, but wait, wait a minute.
So, what do you think of Rodney?

231
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:34,325
Bit of a pretentious fop,
wouldn't you say?

232
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:39,914
- He doesn't remind you of anyone?
- Remind me of anyone?

233
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:42,192
So sorry, but about my coffee.

234
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:44,798
I neglected to mention
that I like my milk steamed.

235
00:13:45,075 --> 00:13:47,589
But just a dollop of foam,
such as might give the effect

236
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:51,657
of a cumulus cloud
reflected in a still pond.

237
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,259
Consider it done.

238
00:13:58,421 --> 00:14:00,651
I want to kill myself.

239
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:04,882
Come on, Niles, it's funny.

240
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:07,328
No, it's not remotely funny.

241
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:11,503
Frasier talked me out of approaching
Daphne the night she fell for that man.

242
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,284
You can't possibly be mad at me.

243
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:16,076
No, no, Frasier, I'm grateful.
Come here.

244
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:18,631
- Let me show you how grateful I am.
- Niles, calm down.

245
00:14:19,943 --> 00:14:22,776
- Isn't Rodney just great?
- Oh, yeah, nice guy.

246
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:26,541
I think it was the moment I broke up
with Joe when I heard a voice say,

247
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:30,495
"Daphne, it's time you went
for a completely new type of man."

248
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:35,243
- You're a dead man.
- I'll serve our guests their coffee.

249
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:37,422
Here we are. Coffee.

250
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:40,547
Milk's on its way.
Niles is still steaming.

251
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:44,388
- Sugar?
- Nothing on earth smells

252
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:47,671
quite so heavenly as
a freshly brewed cup of coffee.

253
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:50,132
Well, perhaps one thing does.

254
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,858
Oh, stop that.

255
00:14:53,143 --> 00:14:55,054
He loves to smell my hair.

256
00:15:01,693 --> 00:15:05,402
- Anne Boleyn?
- Catherine of Aragón.

257
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,107
Oh, for heaven's sake, Niles.

258
00:15:15,957 --> 00:15:19,108
You don't take my calls,
you ignore me.

259
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:22,456
For God's sake, it's the behavior
of a pouting adolescent.

260
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:24,712
Are you quite finished now?

261
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:28,125
You put gum on my chair, didn't you?

262
00:15:30,555 --> 00:15:32,034
Yep.

263
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:35,757
Niles, listen.

264
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:39,978
I am terribly sorry
if I steered you wrong.

265
00:15:40,315 --> 00:15:42,271
But just think about it, you know.

266
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:46,404
You do have a wonderful new
woman in your life now, don't you?

267
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,840
Yes, I suppose I do.

268
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:53,001
And Adelle does make you
very happy, doesn't she?

269
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:55,478
Yes. Yes, she does.

270
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:58,902
Well, then if you've ever taken
any of my advice before, take this.

271
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:03,941
Adelle could very well be
the path to your happiness.

272
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:09,837
But let's just say I'm wrong.

273
00:16:10,929 --> 00:16:15,127
But you're not wrong. Adelle
is a wonderful, affectionate woman.

274
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:20,268
She's clearly drawn
to a man of my type.

275
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:24,917
Just thinking about her lifts my spirits.
Frasier, thank you.

276
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:27,707
Niles, look.

277
00:16:31,866 --> 00:16:33,379
I don't believe it.

278
00:16:33,618 --> 00:16:34,971
The betrayal.

279
00:16:35,203 --> 00:16:38,115
- No one treats Daphne like that!
- Niles.

280
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:41,983
Whatever you do, do not engage
him in a physical fight.

281
00:16:42,252 --> 00:16:44,812
The whole thing
would just look too weird.

282
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:52,990
Hello, Adelle.

283
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:55,621
- Oh, no.
- I know this may look

284
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:57,084
a tad incriminating, but the--

285
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:01,025
Oh, spare me,
you ludicrous popinjay.

286
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:04,869
I know exactly what's going on.
I saw the whole thing from my table.

287
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:08,028
I was gonna call you.
You see, Rodney and I...

288
00:17:10,447 --> 00:17:13,086
- I'm sorry.
- So am I, Adelle.

289
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:15,482
But I'm mostly sorry for Daphne.

290
00:17:15,744 --> 00:17:17,575
How do you intend
to handle that small matter?

291
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:20,146
I was planning on telling her
this evening at Granville's.

292
00:17:20,415 --> 00:17:21,643
We're meeting for drinks.

293
00:17:22,292 --> 00:17:23,850
Granville's.

294
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:26,455
Why don't you do her a favor?
Let me tell her.

295
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:30,672
- Might be better coming from a friend.
- Yes, perhaps you're right.

296
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:32,647
Please tell her that I'm sorry.

297
00:17:32,886 --> 00:17:35,605
Sometimes when a man meets the
woman that he's meant to be with,

298
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:37,959
there's nothing he can do to resist it.

299
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:40,738
I hope Daphne understands that.

300
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,391
I hope she understands it too.

301
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:50,047
Rodney.

302
00:17:50,862 --> 00:17:52,181
Adelle.

303
00:17:55,075 --> 00:17:57,873
You know, there's just one thing
I'd think I'd like to ask you, Rodney.

304
00:17:59,162 --> 00:18:00,481
Do you have an older brother?

305
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:04,357
As a matter of fact, I do. He's always
been the pride of the family.

306
00:18:04,876 --> 00:18:07,310
Handsome, successful, brilliant.

307
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:09,828
I've always been rather jealous of him.

308
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:13,316
Spooky.

309
00:18:24,521 --> 00:18:27,240
- Evening, Daphne.
- Hello, Dr. Crane.

310
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:30,140
You don't seem surprised to see me.

311
00:18:30,652 --> 00:18:33,530
I was running late so I called
Rodney on his cellphone.

312
00:18:33,822 --> 00:18:37,735
- He told me everything.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

313
00:18:38,076 --> 00:18:39,634
I'm sorry for you too.

314
00:18:40,829 --> 00:18:44,139
- Join me in a little sorrow-drowning?
- I believe I will.

315
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:46,573
One more of these, please.

316
00:18:49,671 --> 00:18:51,184
Thank you.

317
00:18:54,092 --> 00:18:57,641
Well, you know,
I can't really blame Adelle.

318
00:18:57,971 --> 00:19:02,089
Rodney's that sort of man
that women seem to go for.

319
00:19:02,434 --> 00:19:04,106
Yes, he is.

320
00:19:04,686 --> 00:19:07,996
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you.
- No, you didn't.

321
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:10,164
I guess I'm just more in the mood

322
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,550
to hear about his
negative qualities right now.

323
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:17,131
Oh, well, he's kind of a know-it-all.
A bit fussy.

324
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:20,926
Has to have everything just so.
He's nuts about cleanliness.

325
00:19:21,244 --> 00:19:23,280
Then there's his clothes,
his precious shoes.

326
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,730
I don't like this road we're on.

327
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:33,408
I mean, wouldn't it be better
if we discussed what's in our future?

328
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:35,311
I suppose.

329
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:38,622
I'll tell you one thing,
after the run I've had lately,

330
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:42,443
I pity the next man I date.
I'll probably rip him to shreds.

331
00:19:43,475 --> 00:19:45,591
What about the man after that?

332
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:51,805
Men can be such an unfeeling lot.
Look at Rodney.

333
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:55,699
The minute he heard I'd broken up
with someone, he moved in for the kill.

334
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:58,520
Is that how all men are?

335
00:19:58,782 --> 00:20:00,898
No, not all men.

336
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:04,595
No, of course they aren't.
You're not.

337
00:20:04,913 --> 00:20:07,711
You're kind, sensitive.

338
00:20:07,999 --> 00:20:10,559
If you ask me, you were
too good for that Adelle.

339
00:20:11,628 --> 00:20:13,505
Thank you, Daphne.

340
00:20:14,297 --> 00:20:18,006
You know, the truth is, my heart
was never really in that relationship.

341
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:22,574
I thought it might not be.

342
00:20:23,223 --> 00:20:26,499
There was someone else
who was too much on my mind.

343
00:20:27,602 --> 00:20:29,354
I had a feeling, Dr. Crane.

344
00:20:30,105 --> 00:20:32,903
- You did?
- Yes.

345
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:35,761
As long as you still have
feelings for your wife,

346
00:20:36,027 --> 00:20:39,099
you know you can't be involved
with anyone else.

347
00:20:40,031 --> 00:20:41,305
And it makes sense to me.

348
00:20:41,533 --> 00:20:44,969
Why, I know I'd never get involved
with a man who was separated.

349
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:48,301
Even if he'd worshipped you
from the day he laid eyes on you?

350
00:20:48,665 --> 00:20:51,862
And don't think that's
not just how they put it too.

351
00:20:54,796 --> 00:20:59,711
No, I think I need to do a bit of
separating myself. From Joe, I mean.

352
00:21:00,093 --> 00:21:04,371
Yes, I'll wait a good long time
before I do any more dating.

353
00:21:04,723 --> 00:21:07,191
Well, I'm glad to hear that.

354
00:21:07,475 --> 00:21:10,467
Yeah. You know, it's funny
when you think about it.

355
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:14,604
The two of us both coming
to this same singles' bar this week.

356
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:18,411
You know, this was the very stool
I was on when I met Rodney.

357
00:21:18,737 --> 00:21:21,729
I was sitting here when I met Adelle.

358
00:21:23,491 --> 00:21:25,846
- What?
- Oh, I was just thinking.

359
00:21:26,161 --> 00:21:30,234
If it had been a different time in both
our lives, we might actually have met.

360
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:33,354
Oh, how do you suppose
that would have gone?

361
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:36,345
- What, our conversation?
- Yes. Go on, just for fun.

362
00:21:36,671 --> 00:21:39,105
We could both use a smile.

363
00:21:39,382 --> 00:21:42,977
Well, I would've said,
"Is this seat taken?"

364
00:21:43,303 --> 00:21:44,941
And you would've said no.

365
00:21:45,764 --> 00:21:48,153
And you would've said,
"My name is Daphne."

366
00:21:48,433 --> 00:21:50,993
And I would've said,
"My name is Niles."

367
00:21:51,311 --> 00:21:53,586
And then I would've said,

368
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:57,620
"What are you doing
for the rest of your life?"

369
00:21:58,777 --> 00:22:02,008
You always know
just the right thing to say.

370
00:22:02,322 --> 00:22:05,632
Oh, I love you, Dr. Crane.

371
00:22:06,785 --> 00:22:08,980
I love you too, Daphne.
