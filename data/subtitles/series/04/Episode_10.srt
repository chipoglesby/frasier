1
00:00:09,727 --> 00:00:12,560
Is it me or is the foam
a tad dense today?

2
00:00:12,727 --> 00:00:15,446
Like a dreary fog on a Scottish moor.

3
00:00:15,607 --> 00:00:18,167
Rather than accent, it overwhelms.

4
00:00:18,367 --> 00:00:20,483
Rather than flirt, it assaults.

5
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:24,077
Rather than watching the ball game,
I have to listen to this.

6
00:00:25,607 --> 00:00:26,960
ROZ: Hey, you guys.
- Hey, Roz.

7
00:00:27,127 --> 00:00:28,276
- Like to join us?
- Oh, yes.

8
00:00:28,447 --> 00:00:32,042
Frasier, listen, don't forget your staff
meeting tomorrow. It starts at...

9
00:00:34,087 --> 00:00:37,921
Well, I certainly hope his tailor can fix
the holes you just burnt in his jacket.

10
00:00:38,367 --> 00:00:40,835
They're not in his jacket.

11
00:00:41,367 --> 00:00:43,039
- It starts tomorrow at 10.
- Thank you.

12
00:00:43,207 --> 00:00:44,686
Hey, Marty, what are
you doing here?

13
00:00:44,847 --> 00:00:47,122
They're dragging me out
to buy some new clothes.

14
00:00:47,287 --> 00:00:49,642
We're taking him to Rudolfo's
once-a-year sale.

15
00:00:49,847 --> 00:00:51,644
It's 50 percent off.
The alterations are free.

16
00:00:51,847 --> 00:00:53,883
Big deal. Butz Clothiers,
they do that every day.

17
00:00:54,047 --> 00:00:58,199
Yes, not to mention the convenience
of getting your pizza right next door.

18
00:00:58,407 --> 00:01:00,318
These guys think I have
bad taste in clothes.

19
00:01:00,527 --> 00:01:01,676
I like the way you dress.

20
00:01:01,887 --> 00:01:03,843
That's what's called the "clincher."
Shall we go?

21
00:01:05,127 --> 00:01:08,676
All right. Well, I'll just hit the head,
and we can get it over with.

22
00:01:08,847 --> 00:01:10,439
Dad, you could show
more enthusiasm.

23
00:01:10,607 --> 00:01:11,596
- Yeah.
MARTIN: Okay.

24
00:01:11,847 --> 00:01:14,759
Gee, I can't wait to hit the head,
and we can get it all over with!

25
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:21,118
Are you finished undressing him
with your eyes?

26
00:01:21,327 --> 00:01:22,999
Please. I'm already
looking for my stockings

27
00:01:23,167 --> 00:01:25,635
and trying to remember
where I parked my car.

28
00:01:26,847 --> 00:01:28,758
I would have thought that gentleman
over there

29
00:01:28,927 --> 00:01:30,679
in the flannel shirt
would be more your type.

30
00:01:30,847 --> 00:01:33,236
Him? Not a chance.

31
00:01:33,527 --> 00:01:35,165
See the way he's slurping
his orange juice?

32
00:01:35,327 --> 00:01:37,124
Sloppy kisser.

33
00:01:37,447 --> 00:01:39,677
Now, you can tell right away
the guy is no good in bed.

34
00:01:39,847 --> 00:01:41,360
He's so cautious.

35
00:01:41,567 --> 00:01:44,240
Look at the way he's blowing
on his coffee.

36
00:01:51,167 --> 00:01:54,921
I wasn't trying to cool it,
I was simply blowing a foam hole.

37
00:01:55,487 --> 00:01:57,523
You don't even wrinkle
the sheets, do you?

38
00:01:58,807 --> 00:02:01,879
Niles, that man across the street
at the newsstand.

39
00:02:02,047 --> 00:02:03,366
Is that who I think it is?

40
00:02:03,567 --> 00:02:04,841
He does look familiar.

41
00:02:05,047 --> 00:02:06,924
- It's T.H. Houghton.
- No!

42
00:02:07,087 --> 00:02:10,045
Just think back to the picture on the
dust cover of his <i>Time Flies Tomorrow.</i>

43
00:02:10,207 --> 00:02:12,357
- A little older, greyer...
- Yeah, <i>Time Flies Tomorrow.</i>

44
00:02:12,527 --> 00:02:13,562
I read that in high school.

45
00:02:13,727 --> 00:02:15,365
- What else did he write?
FRASIER: Nothing.

46
00:02:15,567 --> 00:02:18,240
That's the crux of his legend.
The man published one masterpiece,

47
00:02:18,407 --> 00:02:20,875
and in the 30 years since,
he's become a virtual recluse.

48
00:02:21,047 --> 00:02:24,164
- Oh, my God. It is T.H. Houghton.
- Yes.

49
00:02:24,367 --> 00:02:27,165
We're a stone's throw away
from one of the giants of literature.

50
00:02:27,367 --> 00:02:28,880
Not the way you throw.

51
00:02:30,007 --> 00:02:31,440
Oh, Niles, this is incredible.

52
00:02:31,607 --> 00:02:34,565
My God, the man's entire life is
shrouded in mystery, yet there he is.

53
00:02:34,727 --> 00:02:35,876
I've always idolized him.

54
00:02:36,047 --> 00:02:37,685
What I wouldn't give
to meet that man.

55
00:02:37,887 --> 00:02:39,320
Why don't you go introduce yourself.

56
00:02:39,527 --> 00:02:41,677
Oh, I can't just walk up
to a god like that.

57
00:02:41,887 --> 00:02:43,479
Well, then find a subtler way.

58
00:02:43,687 --> 00:02:46,247
In your vernacular, that would
be what? To slingshot your panties

59
00:02:46,407 --> 00:02:47,556
across the street?

60
00:02:47,927 --> 00:02:51,078
- Foam blower.
- All right, all right, you two.

61
00:02:52,127 --> 00:02:53,446
Niles, she happens to be right.

62
00:02:53,847 --> 00:02:56,236
How often do you get an opportunity
like this? Let's go.

63
00:02:56,447 --> 00:02:58,005
All right.

64
00:02:58,167 --> 00:02:59,964
- Come on, we're going.
- Why? What's the rush?

65
00:03:00,127 --> 00:03:01,879
- T. H. Houghton is across the street.
- Who?

66
00:03:02,087 --> 00:03:05,159
- Come on, let's... Let's go!
MARTIN: Hey, guy with a cane here!

67
00:03:12,887 --> 00:03:15,196
Niles, I thought you said you saw
Houghton come in here.

68
00:03:15,367 --> 00:03:18,200
Well, I'm sorry if my tracking skills
aren't up to your standard.

69
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:19,840
Instead of asking for a baby brother,

70
00:03:20,007 --> 00:03:22,601
you should have asked for a
German short-haired pointer.

71
00:03:23,007 --> 00:03:23,996
I did.

72
00:03:25,727 --> 00:03:27,285
Well, I'm sorry.

73
00:03:27,447 --> 00:03:28,926
He must still be out on the street.

74
00:03:29,127 --> 00:03:30,765
I'm parking it.
They got the Mariners on.

75
00:03:30,927 --> 00:03:33,316
- Please, we can't waste time.
- Let him be. He's deadweight.

76
00:03:33,527 --> 00:03:34,516
FRASIER:
Right.

77
00:03:38,127 --> 00:03:41,437
- What's the score?
- Four to three, Mariners.

78
00:03:42,207 --> 00:03:43,526
BOTH:
Aw!

79
00:03:44,167 --> 00:03:47,159
- How could he miss the cut-off man?
- That man makes 7 million a year.

80
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:48,646
- It's crazy.
- Yeah.

81
00:03:48,807 --> 00:03:52,641
See him scratching his butt?
That's about 5 grand right there.

82
00:03:53,127 --> 00:03:55,687
- Let me have a Ballantine's.
- Yeah, make it two.

83
00:03:56,007 --> 00:03:57,725
BOTH:
Aw!

84
00:04:00,447 --> 00:04:02,483
So that's your favourite character?

85
00:04:02,647 --> 00:04:03,796
- Really?
- Yeah.

86
00:04:04,007 --> 00:04:07,238
Yeah, I really like him. The kind of guy
you can just sit and have a beer with.

87
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:11,406
Well, I could see you saying that
about Hoss, but Little Joe?

88
00:04:12,287 --> 00:04:14,926
That's the great thing about <i>Bonanza.</i>
Something for everyone.

89
00:04:16,967 --> 00:04:19,083
Well, thank you, Mr False Alarm.

90
00:04:19,247 --> 00:04:21,158
"Oh, look, there he is,
over at the yogurt store!

91
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:23,318
Oh, look, there he is,
in the futon store!

92
00:04:23,487 --> 00:04:25,955
Oh, look, there he is with Dad!"

93
00:04:26,927 --> 00:04:28,519
NILES:
And now he's leaving.

94
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:30,445
I must tell him what an impact
his book has made.

95
00:04:30,607 --> 00:04:32,120
Aren't you afraid
it'll sound unoriginal?

96
00:04:32,287 --> 00:04:33,481
- Why?
- I'm gonna say it first.

97
00:04:33,647 --> 00:04:35,319
MAN: Excuse me, Mr Houghton?
- Yeah?

98
00:04:35,527 --> 00:04:39,156
- I just wanted to tell you that...
- My book changed your life. Swell.

99
00:04:39,607 --> 00:04:42,075
- No, no, but I...
- It changed mine too. Look, I'm sorry.

100
00:04:42,287 --> 00:04:45,006
I don't like to discuss my work.

101
00:04:47,167 --> 00:04:48,919
Well, that was humiliating.

102
00:04:49,087 --> 00:04:50,805
I've never felt so rejected in my life.

103
00:04:51,007 --> 00:04:52,281
Now, now, don't take it so hard.

104
00:04:52,447 --> 00:04:53,846
Who was to know
he was so sensitive?

105
00:04:54,047 --> 00:04:57,517
- Aren't you Dr Crane from the radio?
- Not now, haven't got the time, sorry.

106
00:04:58,847 --> 00:05:00,678
Do you realize who you were
just talking to?

107
00:05:00,847 --> 00:05:02,519
- That was T. H. Houghton.
- Yeah, I know.

108
00:05:02,727 --> 00:05:04,797
Well, well, well,
what did you two talk about?

109
00:05:04,967 --> 00:05:07,242
- Oh, I don't know. This and that.
FRASIER: Dad,

110
00:05:07,447 --> 00:05:09,483
virtually nothing is known
about this man.

111
00:05:09,647 --> 00:05:11,080
Can't you give us
something specific?

112
00:05:11,287 --> 00:05:15,485
Well, it was just guy stuff, you know.
Baseball, TV shows, old war stories...

113
00:05:15,687 --> 00:05:17,086
- He told war stories?
- No, I did.

114
00:05:17,247 --> 00:05:19,807
You know, about the time I made
the stew and the platoon got sick.

115
00:05:19,967 --> 00:05:21,605
Dad, how could you?

116
00:05:21,807 --> 00:05:23,320
What? He liked it.

117
00:05:23,487 --> 00:05:25,717
He's a nice guy. I think maybe
I'll buy one of his books.

118
00:05:25,927 --> 00:05:29,158
Not books, Dad. Book.

119
00:05:29,327 --> 00:05:30,316
Book.

120
00:05:30,527 --> 00:05:33,121
He wrote one book
and never wrote again.

121
00:05:33,327 --> 00:05:35,966
If only we'd arrived ten minutes earlier,
we could've talked to him.

122
00:05:36,167 --> 00:05:38,362
We could have explored
that mammoth intellect.

123
00:05:38,567 --> 00:05:42,276
Can you imagine the torture the man's
endured, to peak at such an early age?

124
00:05:42,447 --> 00:05:45,120
Oh, my God, Frasier, look.
It's a doodle!

125
00:05:45,287 --> 00:05:46,800
Not just any doodle,
a Houghton doodle.

126
00:05:47,007 --> 00:05:47,996
- It's mine!
- No, mine!

127
00:05:48,167 --> 00:05:49,680
- It's mine.
- Dad, what do you care?

128
00:05:49,887 --> 00:05:50,922
No, I mean I drew it.

129
00:05:54,367 --> 00:05:55,959
That's very touching. This is for you.

130
00:05:56,167 --> 00:05:57,441
Bye-bye.

131
00:05:59,447 --> 00:06:01,403
I don't know when I've enjoyed
an exhibit more.

132
00:06:01,567 --> 00:06:05,082
The artist's choice to make that a
monochrome was a stroke of genius.

133
00:06:05,287 --> 00:06:07,323
- It conveyed such despair.
FRASIER: Yes.

134
00:06:07,527 --> 00:06:10,246
It was so refreshing
to see a sad peach.

135
00:06:11,127 --> 00:06:12,401
How about that curator?

136
00:06:12,607 --> 00:06:14,006
She was kind of a peach herself.

137
00:06:14,567 --> 00:06:16,876
- No cubism there, I don't think.
- No, certainly not.

138
00:06:18,407 --> 00:06:20,762
MARTIN: Hey, boys.
BOTH: Oh, hi, Dad.

139
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:23,283
Oh, Ted. Ted, I'd like you
to meet my sons.

140
00:06:23,447 --> 00:06:25,324
This is Frasier and Niles.
They're big fans.

141
00:06:25,487 --> 00:06:27,205
- Hi, guys.
FRASIER: Mr Houghton...

142
00:06:27,367 --> 00:06:28,766
We...

143
00:06:29,407 --> 00:06:31,284
Words can't express...

144
00:06:31,487 --> 00:06:33,478
I guess not.

145
00:06:34,767 --> 00:06:36,644
Nice meeting you fellas.

146
00:06:37,447 --> 00:06:41,235
Oh, my God, we missed him again!

147
00:06:41,447 --> 00:06:42,846
- What's going on?
- That's odd.

148
00:06:43,047 --> 00:06:44,878
So where are you two going?

149
00:06:46,047 --> 00:06:48,800
Well, Ted's taking me out to this
bratwurst place he knows.

150
00:06:49,007 --> 00:06:51,760
Bratwurst? Yummy.
My God, that's our favourite.

151
00:06:52,247 --> 00:06:53,726
Nice meeting you.

152

too many people,

so he looked your father up,
gave him a ring,

to watch the Mariners game.

Well, it's a masterpiece.

312
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:48,245
Eddie.

313
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:50,085
I never thought I'd utter these words,

314
00:15:50,247 --> 00:15:53,478
but it actually surpasses
<i>Time Flies Tomorrow.</i>

[BARKING]

316
00:15:55,047 --> 00:15:56,639
Eddie, please!

317
00:15:57,047 --> 00:15:59,117
We're trying to savour the moment.

318
00:16:10,727 --> 00:16:12,604
How was the game?

319
00:16:14,247 --> 00:16:15,362
Is that my manuscript?

320
00:16:15,527 --> 00:16:16,801
What the hell's going on?

321
00:16:17,007 --> 00:16:18,486
HOUGHTON:
You went through my bag?

322
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:21,645
- That's my personal property.
- I don't believe you two.

323
00:16:22,647 --> 00:16:26,322
Mr Houghton, we...
We are terribly, terribly sorry.

324
00:16:26,487 --> 00:16:28,239
The temptation to read it
was just too great.

325
00:16:28,407 --> 00:16:30,045
Oh, what's that supposed to mean?

326
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:32,357
You're grown men,
at least I thought you were.

327
00:16:32,527 --> 00:16:34,643
You had no right to touch that.

328
00:16:34,807 --> 00:16:37,162
Ted, I'm sorry.
I'm just so ashamed.

329
00:16:37,327 --> 00:16:39,158
- Now, it's all right.
- No, it's not all right.

330
00:16:39,327 --> 00:16:41,079
No, no, it's okay, really.

331
00:16:41,247 --> 00:16:43,602
Somebody had to read it first.

332
00:16:44,447 --> 00:16:47,245
So, what did you think?

333
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,043
- Of the book?
- No, of my typing.

334
00:16:50,207 --> 00:16:51,640
Yes, of course, the book.

335
00:16:56,327 --> 00:16:57,396
It was great.

336
00:16:58,807 --> 00:17:00,035
Wow.

337
00:17:01,807 --> 00:17:04,958
Well, at least you liked it.
I'm gonna have to be running.

338
00:17:05,167 --> 00:17:06,839
Are you sure?
I was gonna make some coffee.

339
00:17:07,047 --> 00:17:09,083
No, no, I got an appointment.
Can I use the?

340
00:17:09,287 --> 00:17:11,039
- It's right here.
HOUGHTON: Okay.

341
00:17:13,767 --> 00:17:15,439
Boy, I've had it with you guys.

342
00:17:15,647 --> 00:17:17,478
If you were Hoss and Little Joe,

343
00:17:17,647 --> 00:17:22,323
Ben Cartwright would kick your sorry
butts right off the Ponderosa!

344
00:17:22,927 --> 00:17:24,280
Dad.

345
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:28,685
Dad, we're sorry.

346
00:17:28,847 --> 00:17:29,916
Very sorry.

347
00:17:34,047 --> 00:17:36,515
He's back on the Cartwrights again.

348
00:17:37,287 --> 00:17:40,677
You know, someday we really should
ask him just who the hell they are.

349
00:17:42,807 --> 00:17:46,482
You know, Niles, one thing
just really bugs me.

350
00:17:46,687 --> 00:17:49,884
Houghton's gonna leave thinking we're
just a couple of inarticulate simpletons.

351
00:17:50,047 --> 00:17:52,481
What were those pithy comments
we made about his masterpiece?

352
00:17:52,687 --> 00:17:54,962
- "It was great."
BOTH: "Wow."

353
00:17:55,127 --> 00:17:58,324
Yes, we'll go down in history with the
same boob who first read <i>Hamlet,</i>

354
00:17:58,487 --> 00:18:02,321
then told Shakespeare, "My goodness,
what a parchment-turner!"

355
00:18:03,367 --> 00:18:05,597
Well, it's not too late.
He hasn't left yet.

356
00:18:06,287 --> 00:18:08,755
Yes, yes, we could still say
something to show him

357
00:18:08,927 --> 00:18:11,487
that we appreciated the
full complexity of his work.

358
00:18:13,807 --> 00:18:16,275
Mr Houghton, you know,
there is one further thing

359
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:18,517
- I'd like to add about your book.
- Yeah.

360
00:18:18,727 --> 00:18:21,287
Well, it's the way you modulated
into the second-person narrative

361
00:18:21,447 --> 00:18:25,122
during the flashback scene. Frankly,
beggars anything Faulkner attempted.

362
00:18:25,327 --> 00:18:27,158
Really? That's very flattering.

363
00:18:27,847 --> 00:18:29,917
Oh, wait, I have one too.

364
00:18:30,607 --> 00:18:32,199
The way you so skilfully mirrored

365
00:18:32,367 --> 00:18:34,483
the structure of Dante's
<i>Divine Comedy</i> was inspired.

366
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:35,836
Really?

367
00:18:36,007 --> 00:18:37,838
FRASIER:
Yes, from the inferno of the bordello...

368
00:18:38,007 --> 00:18:40,521
NILES: Which, we noticed,
had exactly nine rooms.

369
00:18:40,727 --> 00:18:43,400
- To the purgatory
of the assembly line,

370
00:18:43,567 --> 00:18:46,764
and finally to the paradise
of the farm.

371
00:18:47,647 --> 00:18:49,000
You both saw that?

372
00:18:49,167 --> 00:18:50,725
Oh, it practically jumped
off the page.

373
00:18:50,887 --> 00:18:53,196
Well, that's very perceptive of you.

374
00:18:53,407 --> 00:18:55,682
Well, thank you.
I guess it's our turn to be flattered.

375
00:18:55,887 --> 00:18:57,923
You're absolutely right.

376
00:18:58,247 --> 00:19:00,681
This whole book is crap.

377
00:19:00,887 --> 00:19:01,876
Beg your pardon?

378
00:19:02,087 --> 00:19:03,406
How could I be so blind?

379
00:19:03,567 --> 00:19:06,604
I lifted the entire structure
from Dante!

380
00:19:07,087 --> 00:19:09,840
- You mean you weren't going for that?
- Of course not!

381
00:19:10,047 --> 00:19:12,038
This confirms my worst fear.

382
00:19:12,247 --> 00:19:14,477
I have nothing original left to say.

383
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:16,006
I'm an empty shell.

384
00:19:16,207 --> 00:19:18,243
I was a fool to think I had
a second book in me!

385
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:21,046
"The winters were harsh
on the farm."

386
00:19:21,247 --> 00:19:24,398
Well, here's something
to warm them up!

387
00:19:24,567 --> 00:19:26,159
MARTIN:
What's going on here?

388
00:19:26,327 --> 00:19:27,316
You're both right.

389
00:19:27,527 --> 00:19:29,643
I'm a talentless hack
who got lucky once.

390
00:19:29,847 --> 00:19:32,042
- We didn't say that!
- You're not listening to them?

391
00:19:32,247 --> 00:19:34,807
- Look at this trash! It won't burn!
- It's a fireplace, you see.

392
00:19:34,967 --> 00:19:37,845
- It's not well ventilated.
- This doesn't belong in a fireplace.

393
00:19:38,407 --> 00:19:42,036
It belongs in the gutter,
with the rest of society's garbage!

394
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:44,357
FRASIER: Wait. No, no...
MARTIN: Ted, don't do that!

395
00:19:44,527 --> 00:19:47,121
- Ted, no! Don't do it!
NILES: No, Mr Houghton...

396
00:19:53,287 --> 00:19:54,925
I want to thank you two.

397
00:19:55,247 --> 00:19:58,557
If I had published that book, my
reputation would have been destroyed.

398
00:19:58,727 --> 00:20:02,356
At least now I'm left
with a shred of dignity.

399
00:20:04,967 --> 00:20:06,286
No.

400
00:20:06,847 --> 00:20:08,246
MARTIN:
Happy?

401
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:10,398
Hey, Ted, wait up!

402
00:20:18,367 --> 00:20:21,439
Well, we've destroyed a man's life.

403
00:20:22,007 --> 00:20:26,205
Not to mention depriving
future generations of a work of art.

404
00:20:26,367 --> 00:20:28,642
Yes, well, on the other hand,
had he actually published it,

405
00:20:28,807 --> 00:20:32,800
the critics surely would've noticed
that Dante parallel.

406
00:20:33,527 --> 00:20:35,802
If he felt bad now, imagine how
he would've felt reading it

407
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:38,435
- in <i>The New York Review of Books.</i>
- Oh, God, yes.

408
00:20:38,647 --> 00:20:41,241
Given his fragile ego, my God,
he would've been devastated.

409
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:43,159
Who knows what
he might have done.

410
00:20:44,727 --> 00:20:46,206
Do you know, Niles,

411
00:20:46,687 --> 00:20:48,837
we saved that man's life.

412
00:20:49,887 --> 00:20:52,321
Yes, I think you're right.

413
00:20:53,367 --> 00:20:56,086
- On the other hand...
- Don't go there.

414
00:20:58,887 --> 00:21:01,720
See, that's why
you're the older brother.
