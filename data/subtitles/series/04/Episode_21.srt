00:07:21,267 --> 00:07:24,942
All right, fine. Well, then, you can take
your crappy old cardigan back too.

151
00:07:25,147 --> 00:07:27,058
I don't know why you gave it
to me in the first place.

152
00:07:27,227 --> 00:07:28,865
- Because I like you.
- Well, I like you.

153
00:07:29,067 --> 00:07:31,058
Than why can't you just accept
my gift and be happy?

154
00:07:31,267 --> 00:07:34,259
- I am happy. I love that cardigan.
- And I love my damn basket.

155
00:07:34,467 --> 00:07:36,776
- What is all this?
- We're exchanging our damn gifts.

156
00:07:36,987 --> 00:07:38,739
MARTIN:
Well, here.

157
00:07:38,947 --> 00:07:39,936
- Here.
- Thanks.

158
00:07:40,147 --> 00:07:41,739
Thank you.

159
00:07:42,947 --> 00:07:44,096
Good Lord.

160
00:07:44,307 --> 00:07:47,504
It's like Christmas morning
in the Gambino household.

161
00:07:52,707 --> 00:07:55,301
By the way, Niles called while you
were in the shower to remind you

162
00:07:55,507 --> 00:07:56,656
about the squash tomorrow.

163
00:07:57,267 --> 00:07:59,781
That's strange. We just made that
date this morning. He must be

164
00:07:59,947 --> 00:08:02,017
champing at the bit to get
an answer to that question.

165
00:08:02,227 --> 00:08:03,262
What question?

166
00:08:03,467 --> 00:08:07,016
Oh, he asked me if I thought he
and Maris were meant to be together.

167
00:08:07,227 --> 00:08:09,616
Well, if you ask me,
you should keep your bazoo shut.

168
00:08:09,827 --> 00:08:12,739
You're always getting in trouble
opening that big bazoo of yours.

169
00:08:12,947 --> 00:08:15,825
How wonderful, Dad. We found a new
word to strike from your vocabulary,

170
00:08:16,027 --> 00:08:19,144
along with patootie and bupkis.

171
00:08:20,267 --> 00:08:21,700
You're gonna answer him, aren't you?

172
00:08:22,227 --> 00:08:24,536
I think I have to. But listen,
I'm just gonna play it safe.

173
00:08:24,747 --> 00:08:26,738
Tell him yes. He's gonna do
what he wants to anyway.

174
00:08:26,947 --> 00:08:29,097
I don't know. He takes
your opinion pretty seriously.

175
00:08:29,307 --> 00:08:31,537
Well, when we were younger,
there was a certain sway

176
00:08:31,707 --> 00:08:32,856
I had over him, but...

177
00:08:33,067 --> 00:08:35,627
Do you remember back in prep
school when he was gonna try out

178
00:08:35,827 --> 00:08:37,897
for the track team?
I convinced him all the cool kids

179
00:08:38,107 --> 00:08:40,177
were gonna join the Madrigal Society?

180
00:08:41,307 --> 00:08:43,537
I'm not just talking about school.
He's always come to you

181
00:08:43,747 --> 00:08:46,022
for career decisions too.
Where to do his residency,

182
00:08:46,227 --> 00:08:47,660
where to set up his practice.

183
00:08:48,627 --> 00:08:51,095
Perhaps I have
underestimated my influence.

184
00:08:51,307 --> 00:08:52,979
You know, frankly,
my opinion could be

185
00:08:53,187 --> 00:08:55,576
the single most important factor
in his making this decision.

186
00:08:55,787 --> 00:08:57,937
- I don't know if I'd go as far as that.
- Please, Dad.

187
00:08:58,147 --> 00:09:00,741
You don't know what it's like
to have your opinion matter.

188
00:09:03,307 --> 00:09:06,697
Niles depends on me. He deserves
my true and honest answer.

189
00:09:06,867 --> 00:09:08,823
- And what is that?
- Well...

190
00:09:09,467 --> 00:09:11,059
Maris has always been
spoiled and selfish

191
00:09:11,267 --> 00:09:13,064
and led him around by the nose.

192
00:09:13,467 --> 00:09:15,105
I'd have to say my answer
would be no.

193
00:09:16,067 --> 00:09:18,979
Thank you, Dad. I've changed
my answer from a yes to a no.

194
00:09:19,187 --> 00:09:20,586
MARTIN:
There you go.

195
00:09:20,787 --> 00:09:23,255
FRASIER: On the other hand...
MARTIN: I knew it.

196
00:09:24,347 --> 00:09:26,986
Well, no, you know, there are
a lot of other factors here, Dad.

197
00:09:27,827 --> 00:09:30,295
Niles does love Maris.

198
00:09:31,107 --> 00:09:34,656
She has agreed to go into therapy,
and Niles swears

199
00:09:34,867 --> 00:09:36,903
that she's a changed person. L...

200
00:09:37,107 --> 00:09:39,575
I don't know. I guess if I really
wanna know what's going on

201
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:41,937
in Maris' mind,
I've got to ask her myself.

202
00:09:42,507 --> 00:09:45,783
- You agree with that, don't you, Dad?
MARTIN: Oh, yeah, sure.

203
00:09:47,067 --> 00:09:49,262
FRASIER: Well, I've got
a couple hours before my date.

204
00:09:49,467 --> 00:09:51,503
So if I really wanna know
what Maris is thinking,

205
00:09:51,707 --> 00:09:53,982
I will go directly to the source.

206
00:09:55,427 --> 00:09:57,577
- Are you ready to order?
- Well, not quite yet.

207
00:09:57,787 --> 00:10:01,143
I'm still waiting on someone.
Oh, there she is now.

208
00:10:04,427 --> 00:10:06,304
Marta.

209
00:10:09,947 --> 00:10:12,097
Marta, I can't tell you how nice
it is to see you again.

210
00:10:12,307 --> 00:10:17,301
My pleasure. And this coffee
is too, too divine.

211
00:10:17,907 --> 00:10:20,341
I see your English lessons
with Maris are progressing nicely.

212
00:10:20,547 --> 00:10:22,219
Yes. She teaching me many words.

213
00:10:22,627 --> 00:10:26,097
That coat is so dëclassë.

214
00:10:27,507 --> 00:10:30,499
Listen, Marta, I'm gonna come
right to my point.

215
00:10:31,227 --> 00:10:34,936
Dr Crane and Maris... Missy Crane.

216
00:10:35,467 --> 00:10:38,220
- Have been seeing
a couples' therapist lately,

217
00:10:38,427 --> 00:10:42,261
- and I understand it's going very well.
- Therapy helping Missy Crane a lot.

218
00:10:42,467 --> 00:10:45,186
Really? So you would say
that she's a changed person?

219
00:10:45,387 --> 00:10:49,619
<i>Si, si.</i> Missy Crane very different,
nicer to everyone.

220
00:10:49,827 --> 00:10:52,057
And this time no happy pills.

221
00:10:54,507 --> 00:10:58,182
For my birthday, she gave me
beautiful Chanel makeup bag.

222
00:10:58,387 --> 00:11:01,060
It's a knockoff, but it's big.

223
00:11:02,107 --> 00:11:05,179
Oh, all right then,
this is my question:

224
00:11:05,547 --> 00:11:08,823
If Dr Crane and Mrs Crane
were to get back together again,

225
00:11:09,027 --> 00:11:10,460
do you?

226
00:11:11,027 --> 00:11:15,737
Do you think that Mrs Crane
would treat Dr Crane better?

227
00:11:15,947 --> 00:11:19,781
Oh, yes. Please ask
Dr Crane to come home.

228
00:11:19,987 --> 00:11:23,582
Marta, you've been most helpful.
You know, lately, I've been wondering

229
00:11:23,787 --> 00:11:25,539
if Niles and Maris ought
to be together.

230
00:11:25,747 --> 00:11:28,739
And now, thanks to you, I know that
the answer to that question is yes.

231
00:11:28,907 --> 00:11:29,896
[MARTA LAUGHS]

232
00:11:30,067 --> 00:11:31,136
What?
Did I say something funny?

233
00:11:31,347 --> 00:11:34,657
No, my beeper on vibrate.
It tickle me.

234
00:11:36,107 --> 00:11:38,337
Sorry. I have to go.
Missy Crane need me.

235
00:11:38,507 --> 00:11:41,943
- Oh, thanks, all right. I understand.
- Thanks for <i>cafe.</i>

236
00:11:42,107 --> 00:11:44,223
Call me. Mean it.

237
00:11:45,027 --> 00:11:47,257
Well, there is a limit.

238
00:11:48,067 --> 00:11:49,420
- Hey.
- Oh, Daphne.

239
00:11:49,627 --> 00:11:51,538
Was that Mrs Crane's Marta
who was just leaving?

240
00:11:51,747 --> 00:11:53,738
It was.
We were just sharing a coffee.

241
00:11:53,947 --> 00:11:56,745
Marta helped allay my fears about
Niles and Maris getting back together.

242
00:11:56,947 --> 00:11:59,859
Yes, I think she'd be glad to see
Dr Crane back in that household.

243
00:12:00,547 --> 00:12:02,936
- I should go get my beans.
- Wait, Daphne. What do you mean?

244
00:12:03,147 --> 00:12:05,183
Well, I'm sure Dr Crane
acts as a good buffer

245
00:12:05,387 --> 00:12:06,900
between Mrs Crane and the help.

246
00:12:07,547 --> 00:12:10,300
Gee, it never occurred to me that
Marta might have an ulterior motive.

247
00:12:10,507 --> 00:12:13,067
Who could blame her?
Mrs Crane can be a bit demanding.

248
00:12:13,267 --> 00:12:16,384
Well, then, this taints
Marta's entire testimony.

249
00:12:16,587 --> 00:12:19,021
Is it possible
she could have lied to me?

250
00:12:19,227 --> 00:12:22,663
No. With my trained eye, very
few things can escape my notice,

251
00:12:22,827 --> 00:12:25,022
as I'm sure
you've observed, Daphne.

252
00:12:25,947 --> 00:12:28,461
You think that l...?
But could she have lied to me?

253
00:12:28,667 --> 00:12:30,464
You know, see,
this is the predicament I'm in.

254
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:33,135
Every time someone gives me
a valid argument, somebody else

255
00:12:33,347 --> 00:12:35,941
comes along, gives me
a perfectly valid counterargument.

256
00:12:36,147 --> 00:12:39,662
One minute I think the answer is yes,
the next minute I think it's no.

257
00:12:41,027 --> 00:12:43,700
This is driving me crazy.
No, I've got to stick with it.

258
00:12:43,907 --> 00:12:47,377
Niles asked me what I think...
That's it. What I think.

259
00:12:47,587 --> 00:12:48,940
I don't know
what I think right now.

260
00:12:49,147 --> 00:12:51,058
But that's where I should focus.
Don't you agree?

261
00:12:51,267 --> 00:12:53,940
Oh, yes, absolutely.

262
00:12:59,867 --> 00:13:03,018
ELISE: Oh, I'm so glad
we're finally doing this.

263
00:13:03,907 --> 00:13:07,104
- Oh, yeah, me too.
- Is everything all right, Frasier?

264
00:13:07,307 --> 00:13:11,300
Oh, yes, yes, yes.
I'm just a little preoccupied.

265
00:13:12,027 --> 00:13:13,745
Stop obsessing.

266
00:13:13,947 --> 00:13:15,938
Enjoy the date.

267
00:13:21,587 --> 00:13:23,179
Here we are.

268
00:13:24,307 --> 00:13:25,456
So where are we going?

269
00:13:25,667 --> 00:13:28,340
I've chosen a little Italian place
I know, if that's all right.

270
00:13:28,547 --> 00:13:29,821
- I trust your judgement.
- Okay.

271
00:13:30,027 --> 00:13:31,346
But then, who doesn't?

272
00:13:36,467 --> 00:13:37,741
Are you okay?

273
00:13:38,507 --> 00:13:40,896
Oh, I'm sorry.

274
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:43,503
I told myself I wasn't gonna
bring this up to you.

275
00:13:43,707 --> 00:13:45,937
I don't really think
it's appropriate for a first date,

276
00:13:46,147 --> 00:13:50,060
but I haven't been able to think about
anything else all day, so here goes.

277
00:13:51,307 --> 00:13:53,457
Do you think it's possible

278
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:58,104
for two people
to be meant for each other?

279
00:13:59,747 --> 00:14:03,660
- You've thought about that all day?
- Yes.

280
00:14:03,867 --> 00:14:06,427
- Well, yes, I do.
- I do too.

281
00:14:06,627 --> 00:14:10,540
But how do you know that they're
meant for each other?

282
00:14:10,747 --> 00:14:13,705
Of course, it's essential that they have
similar interests, goals in common.

283
00:14:13,907 --> 00:14:17,058
- Don't forget physical attraction.
- Oh, well, that's a given. Yeah.

284
00:14:18,347 --> 00:14:20,577
But you know, my ex-wife
and I had all those things,

285
00:14:20,987 --> 00:14:23,182
and our marriage
was an unmitigated disaster.

286
00:14:23,387 --> 00:14:25,742
She probably
just didn't appreciate you.

287
00:14:25,947 --> 00:14:27,744
No, not entirely.

288
00:14:28,547 --> 00:14:30,856
Did she listen
to your show every day,

289
00:14:31,067 --> 00:14:34,696
sometimes even tape it so she
could listen to it in bed at night?

290
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:36,659
I didn't have a show then.

291
00:14:38,867 --> 00:14:43,782
I guess what it comes down to is...
What is that special something

292
00:14:43,987 --> 00:14:47,821
that makes us cry out,
"Yes, we are meant to be together"?

293
00:14:48,027 --> 00:14:51,622
Who knows? All that matters
is that we both feel it.

294
00:14:52,347 --> 00:14:53,382
Hmm?

295
00:14:53,547 --> 00:14:57,699
I would've told you months ago
how I felt, but I was too insecure.

296
00:14:57,907 --> 00:15:00,580
I never dreamed you felt
the same way I did.

297
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:08,742
Frasier, don't turn shy

On one hand, well, perhaps I'm afraid
that if Niles and Maris reconcile,

312
00:16:02,707 --> 00:16:06,017
we may lose the friendship he and I
developed during their separation.

313
00:16:07,907 --> 00:16:10,182
On the other hand, if Maris
does take him back,

314
00:16:10,387 --> 00:16:14,460
well, then, I won't have to feel
so responsible for him.
