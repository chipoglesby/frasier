1
00:00:10,207 --> 00:00:13,005
Baby, baby, all I'm saying
is we should cool it for a while.

2
00:00:13,447 --> 00:00:14,482
No, what's that thing?

3
00:00:14,647 --> 00:00:16,046
"If you love something, let it go.

4
00:00:16,207 --> 00:00:18,277
If it comes back to you..."
Yadda yadda yadda.

5
00:00:18,447 --> 00:00:20,119
Yeah, that's it.

6
00:00:20,287 --> 00:00:22,926
Hey, don't get me wrong,
I'm really broken up about this.

7
00:00:23,087 --> 00:00:25,078
Hey, think fast.

8
00:00:25,287 --> 00:00:26,515
[LAUGHS]

9
00:00:29,207 --> 00:00:31,163
Come on, now...

10
00:00:31,567 --> 00:00:33,523
No tears. No...

11
00:00:33,687 --> 00:00:36,406
I'll never forget you either, Sandy.

12
00:00:36,567 --> 00:00:39,559
Linda? Really?

13
00:00:39,727 --> 00:00:41,479
Well, I thought I was talking
to your sister.

14
00:00:41,647 --> 00:00:43,717
Oh, well, tell her same goes.

15
00:00:45,247 --> 00:00:48,080
- Hey, Frasier, do you have a minute?
- Yes, of course, Roz. What is it?

16
00:00:48,247 --> 00:00:49,726
Well, you're not gonna
like this idea.

17
00:00:49,887 --> 00:00:51,479
You're gonna complain
and make up excuses

18
00:00:51,647 --> 00:00:52,682
and then say no anyway.

19
00:00:52,887 --> 00:00:56,436
That's the very words I would use
to woo my dear Lilith.

20
00:00:57,047 --> 00:00:58,196
Okay, here goes.

21
00:00:58,367 --> 00:01:01,200
I have this friend and I think you two
would really hit it off.

22
00:01:01,407 --> 00:01:03,363
You were wondering if I might
meet her for a drink,

23
00:01:03,527 --> 00:01:05,836
which might lead to dinner,
and after that, who knows where?

24
00:01:06,007 --> 00:01:07,076
Yes, exactly.

25
00:01:07,407 --> 00:01:09,284
Oh, listen, Roz, did you hear that?

26
00:01:09,487 --> 00:01:10,761
What?

27
00:01:10,967 --> 00:01:12,480
If you listen very carefully...

28
00:01:12,647 --> 00:01:15,957
...you can actually hear
my skin crawling.

29
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:20,603
I know, blind dates stink.
But I'm your friend,

30
00:01:20,767 --> 00:01:22,405
- and I'm worried about you.
- Well, Roz...

31
00:01:22,607 --> 00:01:24,757
When was the last time
you were with a woman?

32
00:01:24,967 --> 00:01:28,004
- Seems like almost a year.
- Oh, it has not been that long.

33
00:01:28,167 --> 00:01:30,442
I mean, that is a laugh.

34
00:01:31,487 --> 00:01:32,886
The last time was...

35
00:01:33,767 --> 00:01:36,235
Well, let me see, the...

36
00:01:36,687 --> 00:01:39,599
Well, the tree was still up.
Oh, God.

37
00:01:40,007 --> 00:01:41,486
Her name is Sharon.
She's 5'7".

38
00:01:41,647 --> 00:01:44,161
- Oh, Roz, I'm not interested.
- But she's an incredible person.

39
00:01:44,327 --> 00:01:47,125
She's smart, she's funny.
She's a former pro golfer.

40
00:01:47,287 --> 00:01:49,801
- She just hasn't met the right guy.
- A woman golfer?

41
00:01:49,967 --> 00:01:52,720
Are we quite certain
there is a right guy?

42
00:01:52,927 --> 00:01:54,565
- She dates men.
- Not this one.

43
00:01:54,727 --> 00:01:57,400
She plays chess.
She loves your show.

44
00:01:57,607 --> 00:01:59,757
I know this isn't supposed to
matter to people like you,

45
00:01:59,927 --> 00:02:01,565
but I've seen her in the shower
at the gym,

46
00:02:01,727 --> 00:02:05,037
she has a body that makes
Bo Derek look like Bo Diddley.

47
00:02:06,687 --> 00:02:08,962
A chess player, did you say?

48
00:02:14,207 --> 00:02:15,560
MARTIN:
Look at these pants.

49
00:02:15,727 --> 00:02:19,163
Oh, dear, Mr. Crane. Did Eddie
drag you through the puddles again?

50
00:02:19,367 --> 00:02:21,039
Every last one of them.

51
00:02:21,207 --> 00:02:23,357
Eddie, get in here.

52
00:02:23,567 --> 00:02:25,205
Eddie, I mean now.

53
00:02:27,847 --> 00:02:31,635
What am I gonna do with you?
My favourite shoes are soaked.

54
00:02:34,007 --> 00:02:35,918
Eddie, look at me
when I'm talking to you.

55
00:02:36,127 --> 00:02:37,845
- You're doing it again.
- What?

56
00:02:38,007 --> 00:02:39,998
You're acting like one of those
nutjobs in the park

57
00:02:40,167 --> 00:02:41,964
- who treat their pets like children.
- Yeah?

58
00:02:42,167 --> 00:02:43,805
Well, when you do it outside,
you're a nut.

59
00:02:43,967 --> 00:02:46,401
When you do it inside,
it's your own damn business.

60
00:02:47,047 --> 00:02:49,686
Eddie, go to your room.

61
00:02:51,527 --> 00:02:55,042
Oh, don't worry about your shoes.
I'll get them all dried out for you.

62
00:02:55,207 --> 00:02:57,767
MARTIN: Well, I hope.
They're not just any shoes, you know.

63
00:02:57,967 --> 00:03:00,959
These are Muckabees,
the most comfortable shoes made.

64
00:03:01,127 --> 00:03:04,642
Air-cushioned insoles,
deep flannel lining.

65
00:03:04,807 --> 00:03:07,116
You know, I remember
one anniversary I surprised Hester

66
00:03:07,327 --> 00:03:09,397
with a pair of Lady Muckabees.

67
00:03:09,567 --> 00:03:12,923
Don't remember which anniversary,
but I know it ended with a zero.

68
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:15,843
I don't doubt that.

69
00:03:22,767 --> 00:03:25,759
Oh, all right. I forgive you.

70
00:03:25,967 --> 00:03:28,197
I love you too. Yeah.

71
00:03:28,367 --> 00:03:31,677
You'll always be my very best boy.

72
00:03:33,527 --> 00:03:34,516
[WHISTLES]

73
00:03:34,687 --> 00:03:37,406
You know, Dad, there are some
fathers who actually praise their sons

74
00:03:37,567 --> 00:03:39,523
and whistle at their dogs.

75
00:03:40,167 --> 00:03:42,397
- New suit, huh? Who's the lucky girl?
- If you must know,

76
00:03:42,607 --> 00:03:45,246
I'm meeting a friend of Roz's today
after work, but it's no big deal.

77
00:03:45,407 --> 00:03:48,240
Well, congratulations.
What's it been, a year?

78
00:03:52,087 --> 00:03:54,282
It has not been that long.

79
00:03:54,487 --> 00:03:56,523
I remember the tree was still up.

80
00:03:58,647 --> 00:04:01,207
Well, look at you, all got up
like a dog's dinner.

81
00:04:01,367 --> 00:04:05,963
Yes, it's a new suit. Yes, I'm meeting a
woman. And, yes, it has been a while.

82
00:04:06,127 --> 00:04:10,723
Thanks. That reminds me,
I have to order me cards.

83
00:04:13,327 --> 00:04:16,524
Daphne, are you finished here
with the microwave?

84
00:04:16,687 --> 00:04:18,962
Oh, no.

85
00:04:22,007 --> 00:04:24,567
- My Muckabees!
DAPHNE: I'm sorry.

86
00:04:24,767 --> 00:04:26,723
I didn't mean to leave them
in there for so long.

87
00:04:26,927 --> 00:04:30,078
Yes, well, English cooking
strikes again.

88
00:04:34,727 --> 00:04:38,083
You should be happy your patient feels
healthy enough to terminate therapy.

89
00:04:38,287 --> 00:04:41,359
I would, but it's happened so often
lately I find myself in financial straits.

90
00:04:41,527 --> 00:04:43,961
Deep financial straits.

91
00:04:44,127 --> 00:04:48,040
Look at this belt. Spanish leather.

92
00:04:48,567 --> 00:04:52,321
If Mr. Blackwell comes in, I'll create a
diversion, you can make a dash for it.

93
00:04:53,447 --> 00:04:55,756
Obviously the time has come for me
to expand my practice,

94
00:04:55,927 --> 00:04:58,646
so I'm placing an ad
in <i>Seattle Style</i> magazine.

95
00:04:59,567 --> 00:05:02,240
Advertisement? Isn't that a bit
commercial for a psychiatrist?

96
00:05:02,447 --> 00:05:05,405
Said Dr Pot to Dr Kettle.

97
00:05:07,767 --> 00:05:10,600
Besides, a highly respected
obstetrician on my floor did it,

98
00:05:10,767 --> 00:05:14,760
and now his waiting room has more
swollen bellies than a Buddhist temple.

99
00:05:14,927 --> 00:05:16,997
- Good one, yes.
- I liked it.

100
00:05:17,167 --> 00:05:20,842
Here. I'm on my way to call it in,
I just wanted to run it by you.

101
00:05:21,007 --> 00:05:24,602
All right.
"Dr Niles Crane, Jung specialist.

102
00:05:24,767 --> 00:05:28,555
Servicing individuals, couples,
groups. Satisfaction guaranteed.

103
00:05:29,567 --> 00:05:33,401
Tell me where it hurts."
Well, that's just excellent, Niles.

104
00:05:33,607 --> 00:05:35,598
All you're missing now
is a very tasteful cartoon

105
00:05:35,767 --> 00:05:38,884
of you smiling brightly
and holding a shrunken head.

106
00:05:39,807 --> 00:05:42,275
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.
I was too distracted by your face

107
00:05:42,447 --> 00:05:44,961
going by on the side of a bus.

108
00:05:45,127 --> 00:05:47,083
I'm off.

109
00:05:48,287 --> 00:05:49,561
- Hey, wild thing.
- Yes, hello.

110
00:05:49,767 --> 00:05:55,285
- Look, we have on the same belt.
- Oh, my God.

111
00:05:56,047 --> 00:05:57,162
- Hi, Roz.
- Hey, Frasier.

112
00:05:57,327 --> 00:05:59,158
- Sharon's gonna be here any minute.
- You didn't say anything, did you?

113
00:05:59,327 --> 00:06:01,363
Not a word. She has no idea
this is a set-up.

114
00:06:01,567 --> 00:06:03,080
Good. Now, listen, if I don't like her,

115
00:06:03,247 --> 00:06:06,444
I will simply excuse myself and leave.
But if like her, I will find some polite

116
00:06:06,607 --> 00:06:09,485
and discreet way of indicating
that you may go.

117
00:06:10,647 --> 00:06:12,080
Beat it, Roz.

118
00:06:15,087 --> 00:06:16,759
ROZ: Hi, Sharon.
- Hi, Roz.

119
00:06:16,927 --> 00:06:19,600
Look who I ran into, my boss,
Dr Frasier Crane.

120
00:06:19,767 --> 00:06:21,439
- Hello.
- This is Sharon Payton.

121
00:06:21,607 --> 00:06:23,518
Pleased to meet you.
I'm a big fan of your show.

122
00:06:23,727 --> 00:06:25,797
- Thank you.
- I'm sure you're tired of hearing that.

123
00:06:25,967 --> 00:06:29,482
- You probably get it all the time.
- Oh, well, not lately.

124
00:06:31,767 --> 00:06:34,918
Listen, Sharon, I'm so sorry to do this,
but I just got a call from the office,

125
00:06:35,087 --> 00:06:38,636
- and it's urgent and I have to go.
- Oh, sure, that's all right.

126
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:41,725
Well, you know, as long as you're
here, you might as well join me.

127
00:06:42,927 --> 00:06:44,042
That'd be nice.

128
00:06:44,247 --> 00:06:47,284
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye, Roz.

129
00:06:48,687 --> 00:06:51,918
You know, I really do love
listening to your show.

130
00:06:52,087 --> 00:06:54,476
I think it's because you have
such a soothing voice.

131
00:06:54,687 --> 00:06:57,326
What a very kind thing to say.

132
00:06:59,287 --> 00:07:00,640
I almost called in once.

133
00:07:00,807 --> 00:07:03,275
Really? May I ask what
the problem was?

134
00:07:03,487 --> 00:07:09,642
Well, I'm terribly competitive, which is
great for sports, I used to play pro golf,

135
00:07:09,807 --> 00:07:11,763
but sometimes it seeps
into my personal life.

136
00:07:11,967 --> 00:07:14,527
Well, I don't really think
that's too great a problem,

137
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:17,155
but if I were to make
a recommendation, it might be to...

138
00:07:17,327 --> 00:07:19,887
...start seeing a therapist.

139
00:07:20,087 --> 00:07:21,315
Whoa.

140
00:07:21,487 --> 00:07:23,000
- Hello, gorgeous.
- Hi, Bulldog.

141
00:07:23,167 --> 00:07:26,603
Not you. Hey, aren't you
gonna introduce me?

142
00:07:26,767 --> 00:07:29,201
- Well, actually, I wasn't, no.
- Bob Brisco.

143
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:31,045
- Sharon Payton.
- Yes, good to see you.

144
00:07:31,207 --> 00:07:32,925
- Don't be a stranger.
- Hey, wait a minute.

145
00:07:33,127 --> 00:07:35,800
Wait a minute. Sharon Payton.
I know you.

146
00:07:35,967 --> 00:07:39,039
LPGA, you won
the Denver Open, 1992.

147
00:07:39,247 --> 00:07:42,444
1992. That was a fabulous year for a
particular Chambertin I took a shine to...

148
00:07:42,607 --> 00:07:46,282
I know you too. You're that guy
that said golf is not a sport.

149
00:07:46,487 --> 00:07:47,840
- Well, it's not.
- Really?

150
00:07:48,007 --> 00:07:52,683
Yeah. No cheerleaders, no blood, the
only cups involved are in the ground.

151
00:07:52,887 --> 00:07:56,004
This reminds me of a debate I had with
my brother Niles about whether or not

152
00:07:56,167 --> 00:07:57,759
Stephen Sondheim
is really light opera.

153
00:07:57,927 --> 00:08:00,157
You know, I have a theory that people
who put down golf

154
00:08:00,327 --> 00:08:02,283
do so because they can't play well.

155
00:08:02,487 --> 00:08:04,557
- Is that a challenge?
- It might be.

156
00:08:04,767 --> 00:08:06,564
If we leave now,
we could get in nine holes.

- I got a nine handicap.

You're on. Frasier, would you like
to join us?

159

- Well, no, I don't play.
- Well, it was really nice meeting you.

160

that I might meet Sharon.

162

Things were going
in a very positive direction.

163
00:08:22,487 --> 00:08:24,603
Yeah, well, things seem
to have changed, haven't they?

164
00:08:24,767 --> 00:08:28,396
- What do you call that? Irony?
- Is there nothing I can do

165
00:08:28,567 --> 00:08:31,559
- to appeal to your sense of decency?
- Hey, I have no sense of decency.

166
00:08:31,767 --> 00:08:33,485
That way, my other senses
are enhanced.

MARTIN:
But the real secret of Muckabees

168
00:08:43,687 --> 00:08:46,485
is that they mould themselves
to the shape of your foot.

169
00:08:46,687 --> 00:08:49,121
Now, my problem was always
hammertoes.

170
00:08:49,287 --> 00:08:52,040
If you had hammertoes, you'd have
a hell of a time finding shoes.

171
00:08:52,207 --> 00:08:55,756
But Muckabees fit over
my hammertoes like a glove.

172
00:08:58,807 --> 00:09:00,684
Funny, you know,
when you're young,

173
00:09:00,847 --> 00:09:03,645
you dream about fame and fortune.
When you get to be my age,

174
00:09:03,807 --> 00:09:06,719
all you really want out of life
is a comfy pair of shoes.

175
00:09:06,927 --> 00:09:11,079
Right now I'd settle for never hearing
the word "hammertoes" again.

176
00:09:11,287 --> 00:09:14,404
Hey, don't give me any attitude.
Wasn't me that nuked the Muckabees.

177
00:09:14,607 --> 00:09:16,723
I'm not the one who can't remember
where the store is

178
00:09:16,887 --> 00:09:19,879
- where you bought the damn shoes.
- Just drive. I'll tell you when to stop.

179
00:09:20,087 --> 00:09:22,078
Stop!

180
00:09:22,727 --> 00:09:25,036
- Is that it?
- It's a red light.

181
00:09:26,807 --> 00:09:30,880
- In this country, we stop for those.
- All right, all right.

182
00:09:31,327 --> 00:09:34,876
- Woman driver.
- Hammertoes.

184

What? Haven't you
spoken with Sharon?

185

Look, before you snap my behind
with a wet towel,

188
00:10:02,007 --> 00:10:06,080
the last time I saw Sharon was leaving
Cafë Nervosa with Bulldog.

189
00:10:06,287 --> 00:10:08,005
Frasier! How could you
let that happen?

190
00:10:08,167 --> 00:10:11,125
Well, I don't know. The whole thing
is sort of a blur. We were talking about

191
00:10:11,287 --> 00:10:14,085
golf and something called a handicap,
the next thing I know, I'm sitting

192
00:10:14,247 --> 00:10:17,717
with a cappuccino, muttering to myself
in a very soothing voice.

193
00:10:18,287 --> 00:10:20,198
- I'm sorry.
- Well, it's all right, Roz.

194
00:10:20,367 --> 00:10:23,006
It's just the whole thing just
catapulted me back to high school.

195
00:10:23,167 --> 00:10:26,318
You've only known me as an adult,
but back then I was rather

196
00:10:26,487 --> 00:10:29,240
- an unathletic, bookish sort.
- Get out.

197
00:10:29,727 --> 00:10:31,160
Jocks were the bane
of my existence.

198
00:10:31,367 --> 00:10:35,076
They called me a weenie, and they
would steal all the girls that I wanted.

199
00:10:35,247 --> 00:10:38,080
Oh, Frasier, you must have had
some girlfriends.

200
00:10:38,247 --> 00:10:41,762
Friends, yeah. Yeah, any time they
wanted a sensitive shoulder to cry on,

201
00:10:41,967 --> 00:10:44,561
but some blockheaded pillar
of testosterone would come and it was:

202
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:47,321
"Bye, Fras,
maybe we can study later."

203
00:10:48,487 --> 00:10:51,206
Then I'd head home to Niles and we'd
put on the <i>Brandenburg Concertos</i>

204
00:10:51,367 --> 00:10:54,962

Gee, what a couple of nerdlingers.

Oh, and I suppose you were
Miss Popular in high school.

00:16:14,727 --> 00:16:18,037
Okay, sports enthusiasts,
this is Dr Frasier Crane

302
00:16:18,207 --> 00:16:20,721
filling in for Bob "Bulldog" Brisco.

303
00:16:22,447 --> 00:16:24,563
- You're on the air.
MAN 2: <i>This is Mike.</i>

304
00:16:24,727 --> 00:16:26,718
<i>I wanted to talk to Bulldog,</i>
<i>but you'll do.</i>

305
00:16:26,887 --> 00:16:29,879
<i>So, what's your take on</i>
<i>the damn Yankees this season?</i>

306
00:16:30,047 --> 00:16:34,882
Are you speaking of the frothy musical
adaptation of the Faustian myth

307
00:16:35,207 --> 00:16:37,516
or the baseball team
of which I know nothing?

308
00:16:38,127 --> 00:16:40,197
MAN 2:
<i>What a weenie.</i>

309
00:16:40,687 --> 00:16:42,917
Doesn't that take me back.

310
00:16:43,207 --> 00:16:45,641
But he brings up a good point.
You see, while I'm on the air,

311
00:16:45,807 --> 00:16:49,197
please feel free to call in about
anything other than sports. Please.

312
00:16:50,127 --> 00:16:51,685
Hello, you're on the air.

313
00:16:51,887 --> 00:16:53,957
MAN 3: <i>You think it was</i>
<i>a good idea for the Sonics</i>

314
00:16:54,127 --> 00:16:55,321
<i>to give up those draft choices</i>

315
00:16:55,487 --> 00:16:57,318
<i>so they could free up some money</i>
<i>under the cap?</i>

316
00:16:57,487 --> 00:17:00,718
<i>You know, to go after a wide body</i>
<i>to help them in the paint?</i>

317
00:17:02,367 --> 00:17:04,278
Yes.

318
00:17:06,847 --> 00:17:08,838
You're on the air.

319
00:17:09,047 --> 00:17:11,197
Bulldog!

320
00:17:11,367 --> 00:17:15,121
I know you're in there. Get out here.

321
00:17:15,287 --> 00:17:20,315
Give me a break, Leonard. Like you
haven't fantasized about this moment.

322
00:17:20,967 --> 00:17:23,435
BULLDOG: Go away, Roz.
- Will you grow up.

323
00:17:23,607 --> 00:17:25,165
So you got dumped.

324
00:17:25,367 --> 00:17:28,757
You got a little payback for the way
you treated women all your life.

325
00:17:28,927 --> 00:17:33,000
Besides, the Bulldog I know
doesn't get sad.

326
00:17:33,167 --> 00:17:35,078
- He gets angry.
BULLDOG: You're right.

327
00:17:35,807 --> 00:17:40,119
This stinks! This is total, total B.S.

328
00:17:42,327 --> 00:17:45,478
If you don't come out in the next three
seconds, I'm gonna reach in there

329
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:49,799
- and drag you out by your ankles.
- Hello, Roz, playing hard to get?

330
00:17:51,767 --> 00:17:54,406
It's Bulldog. You're a psychiatrist.
Help him.

331
00:17:54,607 --> 00:17:57,804
As distressed as I am by his condition,
he's not the only one suffering here.

332
00:17:57,967 --> 00:18:00,037
In eight minutes we are going
to lose our patio table.

333
00:18:00,207 --> 00:18:03,563
Well, as long as Frasier's filling in
for Bulldog, you're not going anywhere.

334
00:18:03,727 --> 00:18:05,524
You poor man. Help is at hand.

335
00:18:06,887 --> 00:18:09,560
BULLDOG:
No! No shrinks! I hate shrinks.

336
00:18:09,727 --> 00:18:12,002
You're all a bunch of
wimps, weirdos.

337
00:18:12,727 --> 00:18:14,683
Help me.

338
00:18:16,047 --> 00:18:18,880
There, there. I'm here for you.

339
00:18:19,047 --> 00:18:21,880
And you're over there for me.

340
00:18:24,407 --> 00:18:27,126
Well, I sense you're
in a great deal of pain.

341
00:18:27,287 --> 00:18:29,926
- Yeah. Make it stop.
- No.

342
00:18:30,127 --> 00:18:32,436
No, the first step toward healing
is not to bury the pain,

343
00:18:32,607 --> 00:18:34,086
but to feel it at its fullest depths.

344
00:18:34,287 --> 00:18:36,198
[SCREAMS]

345
00:18:38,447 --> 00:18:41,678
Okay, well, before security arrives,
let's skip on to step two.

346
00:18:43,087 --> 00:18:45,806
- What is going on?
- Excuse me. Frasier, we're in session.

347
00:18:45,967 --> 00:18:48,276
We have to pull him together
in minutes, not in a lifetime.

348
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:52,600
- How dare you talk to me like that.
- We don't have time for this. Get out!

349
00:18:52,807 --> 00:18:54,399
Bulldog, I'm referring you
to my brother.

350
00:18:54,567 --> 00:18:56,637
I'll call Francois and tell him
there's been a death.

351
00:18:56,807 --> 00:18:59,037
That ought to buy us
another ten minutes.

352
00:18:59,207 --> 00:19:02,244
We're on a newsbreak. You have got
to pull yourself together because

353
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:04,363
there is no way I am enduring
any more humiliation.

354
00:19:04,527 --> 00:19:06,677
- I am not going out there, man.
- You have got to.

355
00:19:06,847 --> 00:19:09,759
I can't even decipher the abbreviations
on the score sheets. I'm guessing

356
00:19:09,927 --> 00:19:13,442
by your producer's guffaws that it is
not the Cleveland Independents.

357
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:18,638
I just never felt this way
about a chick before.

358
00:19:20,247 --> 00:19:23,478
I was even thinking about
her and me having kids.

359
00:19:23,807 --> 00:19:26,719
- Isn't that scary?
- Positively bone-chilling.

360
00:19:27,487 --> 00:19:30,638
- It hurts like hell.
- I know. I know, Bulldog.

361
00:19:30,807 --> 00:19:34,197
You know, often through pain
we can achieve emotional growth.

362
00:19:34,367 --> 00:19:36,517
It reminds me of a paper
I recently presented

363
00:19:36,687 --> 00:19:38,837
to the Vancouver Psychiatric
Association. The gravamen

364
00:19:39,007 --> 00:19:41,475
of my discourse was that
the sufferer, i.e. You...

365
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:44,366
Doc, doc, you're hurting
my head here.

366
00:19:44,567 --> 00:19:48,162
Can't you stop being a shrink
and just be, like, a guy?

367
00:19:48,367 --> 00:19:50,005
Like a guy.

368
00:19:53,327 --> 00:19:55,283
Like a guy.

369
00:19:56,807 --> 00:19:58,718
Screw her!

370
00:20:00,007 --> 00:20:01,645
- What?
- Yeah, you don't need her.

371
00:20:01,807 --> 00:20:03,445
She's trash!

372
00:20:04,127 --> 00:20:06,561
- Yeah, trash.
- You're better off! We both are!

373
00:20:06,767 --> 00:20:08,564
- I like the sound of this.
- Yeah, so do I!

374
00:20:08,727 --> 00:20:11,195
It's unattractive, yet liberating.
Like the one and only time

375
00:20:11,367 --> 00:20:13,244
I wore a European bathing suit.

376
00:20:13,447 --> 00:20:17,804
- Oh, I'm sorry. She's a bitch!
- Hey, she wasn't even that hot.

377
00:20:18,007 --> 00:20:20,396
All she did was save you
the trouble of having to dump her.

378
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:22,404
- I never thought about that.
- There you go.

379
00:20:22,567 --> 00:20:24,000
- I'm feeling a little better.
- That's right.

380
00:20:24,167 --> 00:20:25,566
- Thanks.
- Come on.

381
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:27,445
- It's great talking to you.
- Likewise.

382
00:20:27,607 --> 00:20:30,565
You know, I could talk like this
for another 30 seconds.

383
00:20:31,287 --> 00:20:32,322
She was nothing!

384
00:20:32,487 --> 00:20:35,001
- She was less than nothing!
- Yeah, right.

385
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:36,839
Tomorrow you're gonna find
somebody even hotter,

386
00:20:37,047 --> 00:20:38,526
and you know
what you're gonna do?

387
00:20:38,687 --> 00:20:42,566
You're gonna have your fun with her
and dump her just for the hell of it!

388
00:20:43,887 --> 00:20:45,718
- Yeah, dump her!
- And you know what?

389
00:20:45,887 --> 00:20:48,196
You're not gonna feel bad
about it at all. You know why?

390
00:20:48,367 --> 00:20:51,086
Because we're guys,
and that's what guys do!

391
00:20:53,087 --> 00:20:55,601
Distressing news, Frasier.
Francois gave away our table.

392
00:20:55,807 --> 00:20:57,286
Screw him!

393
00:20:58,087 --> 00:20:59,440
- Excuse me?
- You heard me!

394
00:20:59,647 --> 00:21:02,286
We don't need him or his stinky little
restaurant. There are plenty

395
00:21:02,447 --> 00:21:06,281
of restaurants. I say we go somewhere
we don't even need a reservation!

396
00:21:09,047 --> 00:21:10,685
- Thank you, Niles.
- You're welcome.

397
00:21:10,887 --> 00:21:14,562
If we hasten, perhaps we can catch
the first seating at Monsieur Galbolon.
