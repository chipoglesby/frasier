1
00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:11,370
It sure--

2
00:00:11,594 --> 00:00:12,549
- Hello, Frasier.
- Niles.

3
00:00:12,762 --> 00:00:14,718
- Maureen.
- Hi, Niles.

4
00:00:17,058 --> 00:00:18,889
A, uh, nonfat cap, please.

5
00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:22,056
- I'll pay for his too.
- Well, thank you.

6
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:24,949
My day started off with good news,
and it's already getting better.

7
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:26,552
To what do I owe this largesse?

8
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:28,649
Well, I'm having
a pretty great day too.

9
00:00:28,903 --> 00:00:31,212
See, a few months ago,
I took my first tennis lesson--

10
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:34,049
And you've finally
mastered the backhand.

11
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:36,244
No, I haven't played since.

12
00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:37,927
But the guy who was teaching me--

13
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:40,279
Has won your girlish heart.

14
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:41,655
No, he was a loser.

15
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:44,514
But that day, he hit me this
little dink shot,

16
00:00:44,794 --> 00:00:46,466
and I ran for it,
and I stubbed my toe.

17
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:50,023
I got this big black toenail
that lasted for, like, three months,

18
00:00:50,342 --> 00:00:51,980
and today it finally fell off.

19
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:55,665
I can wear sandals again.

20
00:00:58,641 --> 00:01:00,359
- Thanks, Frasier.
- Goodbye, Maureen.

21
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:01,830
- And good luck.
- Thanks.

22
00:01:03,355 --> 00:01:07,268
- Frasier, may I borrow your spoon?
- Certainly.

23
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:10,107
I have an announcement.

24
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:12,136
You know, frankly, so do I.

25
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:14,958
Dad's girlfriend just told me
some very big news.

26
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:16,993
Well, unless she's expecting
our baby brother,

27
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:19,040
my news takes precedence.

28
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,514
- She's not, is she?
- No, no.

29
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:26,166
Guess who just won this year's
Mariott Fassbinder Award

30
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:28,895
for Distinguished Contribution
to the Literature of Psychiatry.

31
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:31,481
Judging from the canary feathers
protruding from your mouth,

32
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:32,873
- I'd say you.
- Yes.

33
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:35,076
What article did you win for?

34
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:38,022
A gripping case history
of a narcissistic opera singer.

35
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:40,456
I called it, "Me Me Me Me Me."

36
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:44,320
- It's very clever. I like that.
- Yes.

37
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,631
Thrilled as I am, I must admit I'm a tad
nervous about the awards banquet.

38
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:51,019
- Why?
- Dad.

39
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:52,877
I want him there, of course,

40
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:55,343
but I'm just dreading a rerun
of Aunt Vi's wedding.

41
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:59,164
Yes, the hour he spent regaling
the table with "Little Niles" stories.

42
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:00,722
Exactly.

43
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,910
Imagine an entire roomful
of trained psychiatrists

44
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:06,918
hearing the story of Sheldon,
my imaginary protégé.

45
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,110
Oh, yes, Sheldon.

46
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:12,249
That troubled little fellow
who kept wetting your bed.

47
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:16,962
Well, you know, if you're thinking
of excluding Dad from the event,

48
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:18,980
your timing couldn't be worse.

49
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:20,416
It's his birthday this weekend.

50
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:22,240
Oh, right.

51
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:24,508
On top of that,
Maureen just told me

52
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:26,680
that she's decided
to break it off with him.

53
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:28,371
- No.
- Yes.

54
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:31,040
Oh, dear. What...?

55
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:32,432
Is it the age difference?

56
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:34,449
No, no, she was quite emphatic
on that point.

57
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:36,448
She just thinks they have
nothing in common.

58
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:39,337
Oh, poor Dad. I know how much
he enjoyed going out with her.

59
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:41,050
Yes, just the other day
he was saying

60
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:43,402
that between her police badge
and his handicap sticker,

61
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:45,381
they could park anywhere.

62
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:52,411
Evening, Dr. Crane.

63
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:55,349
Daphne, thank God you're home first.
Listen, I have to warn you.

64
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:57,828
- About what?
- Dad and Maureen are on a date.

65
00:02:58,094 --> 00:03:00,892
It's not going well. She's telling him
that she wants to break it off.

66
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,251
Oh, this vision you're getting,

67
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:05,753
is it a tingly feeling
and a picture in your head,

68
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:09,216
or more like a husky voice
murmuring in your ear?

69
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:11,160
It's not a vision.

70
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:13,727
Maureen told me about this
this afternoon.

71
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:16,419
Just worried about Dad.
We have to help him through this.

72
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:18,751
I wouldn't worry about your father.

73
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:21,220
People are more resilient
than you think.

74
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:23,563
You know, when Joe dumped me
a few weeks ago,

75
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:25,580
I thought I'd lost the love of me life.

76
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:29,505
I figured I'd spend the rest of my years
dwelling on what might have been.

77
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:32,667
The home we'd have made,
the children running through it,

78
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:35,351
growing old together.

79
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:38,317
Did I mention Joe's getting married?

80
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:41,524
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- No, I'm all right.

81
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:49,392
Oh, Daphne. Daphne.

82
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:52,740
That'll be fine.

83
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:58,200
I should've known
that you'd hate Indian food.

84
00:03:58,446 --> 00:04:01,802
No, it was great. I just-- You know,
it just takes a little getting used to.

85
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:04,108
Yeah, it does.
You should try it again sometime.

86
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:07,058
I think I just did.

87
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:11,615
So are you gonna come in
for some coffee?

88
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:15,005
No, you're not feeling too well.

89
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:16,775
I think I'll just call it a night.

90
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:19,475
I thought you said there was
something you wanted to talk about.

91
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:21,571
It can wait.

92
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,564
- Good night.
- Good night.

93
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:28,377
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi.

94
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:29,590
How was your date?

95
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:32,200
Awful. I never felt this bad
in my life.

96
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:34,433
- Oh, Dad.
- Yeah.

97
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:37,524
I feel like my guts
have been ripped out.

98
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:41,565
Dad, let me assure you
this has nothing to do with your age.

99
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:45,141
The hell it doesn't. This never would've
happened 20 years ago.

100
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:50,639
Well, you know, Dad,
I may be talking out of turn here,

101
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:52,507
but Maureen told me about this.

102
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:54,309
- What?
- Yes.

103
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:56,023
Yes, she came to me for advice.

104
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:58,051
That's how determined she was
not to hurt you.

105
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,287
You see...

106
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:01,020
...she wanted to make it
perfectly clear

107
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,648
that her breaking up with you
had nothing to do with your age,

108
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:05,202
but, rather, your compatibility.

109
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,749
You see, it's not your fault

110
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:09,009
that you don't like the same food,
music or movies--

111
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:11,462
And she didn't bring this up,
did she?

112
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:14,655
- No.
- Dad, I'm sorry.

113
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:18,493
- She doesn't want to see me again?
- I know. I feel so terrible.

114
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:22,212
Listen, Dad, I know exactly how
you're feeling right now.

115
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:24,241
But, believe me, the pain will pass.

116
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:25,685
It may take some time.

117
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:28,218
This is great.

118
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:30,300
Or not.

119
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,309
Wait till I tell Sherry.

120
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,053
- Sherry?
- Wow.

121
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:37,011
This stuff works pretty good.
We got any pretzels?

122
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,415
Dad?

123
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:41,269
Just who is Sherry?

124
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:43,544
She's this great lady I met
down at McGinty's.

125
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:45,520
You know, I've been trying for weeks

126
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:47,480
to get up the nerve
to end it with Maureen.

127
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:51,127
Good Lord. I've been worried
all afternoon about

128
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:55,147
Maureen breaking your heart,
and all along, you've been two-timing--

129
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,993
Maureen.

130
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:00,383
Oh.

131
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:02,449
Well, hi, Maureen. Come in.

132
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:07,644
- Did you forget something?
- Yes, I did.

133
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:11,230
Oh, don't mind me.
I was just going out.

134
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,332
To the powder room.

135
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,766
Bye-bye.

136
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:20,577
There's something that I've
been meaning to say to you,

137
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:21,908
and I keep putting it off.

138
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:24,346
And that's not fair to you.

139
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:26,423
What is it?

140
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:31,542
I don't think it's working out.

141
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:34,106
You don't?

142
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,681
Wow.

143
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:39,460
I didn't see that coming.

144
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:43,888
Marty, it's not the age difference.

145
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:46,873
It's just... All we ever talk about
is the police force,

146
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:49,717
- and I enjoy that, but I just think--
- No, Maureen.

147
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:52,666
Now, come on.
You don't need to explain.

148
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:56,705
You know, I guess I always knew

149
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,788
that I could never hold on
to a prize like you forever.

150
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:08,114
But at least I did it for a while.

151
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,530
So are--? Are you okay?

152
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:12,795
I will be.

153
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:16,770
It just takes a little time,
you know, but...

154
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,234
You take care of yourself.

155
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:22,320
Yeah, you too. Okay.

156
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:33,536
- You old fraud.
- What?

157
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:35,698
You made her believe
that she'd broken your heart.

158
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:36,944
Well, of course I did.

159
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:39,918
When a woman breaks up with you,
you have to act sad. It's only polite.

160
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:41,643
Polite?

161
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:44,438
My God, Dad, guilt is
a very destructive emotion.

162
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:46,545
Spare me the Ivy League bull.

163
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,394
There ain't a dame alive who wouldn't
rather break a guy's heart

164
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:51,430
than think she hadn't
even made a dent in it.

165
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,389
I may not have been to Harvard,
but I have been to the college of love.

166
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:59,790
Apparently on a Spillane Fellowship.

167
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:04,693
- Hello, Dr. Crane.
- Hey, Daphne.

168
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:06,934
- Hello, Niles.
- Where's the birthday boy?

169
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:09,265
He's getting all dolled up
for his lady friend.

170
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:11,169
You should see how excited he is.

171
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:13,842
Not half as excited as he's going to be
when he sees these new videos.

172
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:15,996
Twelve cassettes of the history
of World War II.

173
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:19,526
For those who thought the original
was fun but too short.

174
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:23,473
This year I thought, "What the hell,
give him something he wants

175
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:25,072
instead of what I think he needs."

176
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:27,446
- Very commendable sentiment.
- What did you get him?

177
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:29,593
An Armani tux.

178
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:32,436
Well, my banquet's coming up.

179
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:35,238
- Hey, Niles.
- Hey, Dad.

180
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:38,154
- Don't you look dapper?
- Well, thanks.

181
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:40,869
Yeah, I heard the door.
I thought maybe it was Sherry.

182
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:43,830
I thought we were joining her
and your chums at the restaurant.

183
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:45,096
Yeah, I changed my mind.

184
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:48,114
You know, I just thought that--
I'm just so anxious for you to meet her.

185
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:50,758
I know you're gonna love her.
No. Forget I said that.

186
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:53,499
I mean, you will,
but I just don't wanna jinx it.

187
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:56,984
There it is. Frasier, answer the door,
would you, please?

188
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:59,156
No, wait, I'll get it.

189
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,628
Happy birthday.

190
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,034
Come on in and meet the family.

191
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:13,990
Hi. Sherry Dempsey.

192
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:18,297
Now, Marty didn't tell me
the two of you were so handsome.

193
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,897
Hello. Daphne Moon.

194
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:23,495
Oh, the physical therapist.

195
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:25,842
- Right.
- Don't worry about me, honey.

196
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:27,335
I'm not the jealous type.

197
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:31,526
Anybody that keeps my Marty limber
is aces in my book.

198
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:34,938
- Hey, sit down, Sherry. Come on.
- Okay.

199
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,668
You know, Fras,
Sherry's a big fan of your show.

200
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:39,271
Oh, yes, a big fan.

201
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:41,726
Well, as a matter of fact,
when my friend Donna's marriage

202
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:44,466
was on the rocks, you were the one
that she called for advice.

203
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:46,742
Really? And did my advice
prove helpful?

204
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:49,089
That's not important.

205
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:52,570
- You cared. That's what matters.
- Can we offer you a drink?

206
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:57,363
Well, actually, since it's a special
occasion, I brought some bubbly.

207
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:59,838
- Let's crack it open.
- Well.

208
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:03,451
Yes, why not?

209
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:07,038
Oh, look, Frasier, Cold Duck.

210
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:10,747
- You ever had it?
- Just once.

211
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:12,824
- I'll do the honors.
- Thank you.

212
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:15,983
Oh, I love this apartment.

213
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:19,399
- Wow, that's some view you've got.
- Thank you.

214
00:10:19,703 --> 00:10:20,818
Which room's mine?

215
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,548
Gotcha.

216
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:27,748
She's always doing stuff like that.

217
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:30,327
Oh, I love making people laugh.

218
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:32,863
To me, humor is like medicine.

219
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:35,522
Guess we're in the placebo group.

220
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:41,706
So, um...

221
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:45,732
Dad tells me that you, you two kids
met at McGinty's.

222
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:47,583
That's right. I tend bar there.

223
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:50,612
Saw your dad there one night
looking kind of lonesome,

224
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,334
- and I said to myself--
- Bottoms up.

225
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,554
Well, something like that.

226
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,851
- Here we go.
- Thank you.

227
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:00,914
- Well, happy birthday.
- Thank you.

228
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:02,913
- Yes.
- Through the lips and over the gums--

229
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:05,040
Look out taste buds, here it comes.

230
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:07,061
I never heard that version.

231
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:10,071
- Mmm.
- Ooh.

232
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:12,089
Mmm.

233
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:15,297
Ooh. Lovely.

234
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:17,889
Woo!

235
00:11:18,762 --> 00:11:19,831
Oh!

236
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:25,712
I'd better be careful. Two glasses
of that, I'd be dancing on the table.

237
00:11:26,478 --> 00:11:28,867
Yeah, you know,
Sherry used to be on stage.

238
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:30,421
On Broadway?

239
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:32,161
Las Vegas. Ever been there?

240
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,231
Just once.

241
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:38,338
What a town, huh?
Great food, terrific theater.

242
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:40,374
Just too darn easy to get married.

243
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:44,485
- You're separated, right?
- Yes.

244
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:45,823
I've been there.

245
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,472
- Listen, you want my advice?
- Well--

246
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:50,460
Don't mope.
Get right back in the saddle.

247
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:52,026
My mama always used to say to me,

248
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:55,086
"Honey, the only way to get over
someone is to get under someone."

249
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:02,044
- It's cute, isn't it?
- Yeah.

250
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:03,855
Well, Mama had lots
of sayings like that.

251
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:07,284
I didn't know Mae West had children.

252
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:11,215
Well, hey, we'd better be going.

253
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:13,999
So if you want to freshen
up or anything, you'd better do it now.

254
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:15,913
- It's down there.
- I'll show you the way.

255
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:18,950
I know what you're doing here.
You just want the reviews.

256
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,508
Talk me up.

257
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,459
No, that's not it at all.
You think you're so smart.

258
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,335
Well, what do you think?

259
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:28,051
- Wow.
- Niles?

260
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:31,645
Oh, I'll see that "wow"
and raise you a "zowie."

261
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:36,131
I'm so glad you like her.
Now, you really do, right?

262
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:37,578
Yes, Dad.

263
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:39,596
- Absolutely.
- That's great.

264
00:12:39,843 --> 00:12:41,754
Great. We're gonna have to
spend more time here.

265
00:12:42,012 --> 00:12:45,209
You know, she's got that fourth-floor
walk-up, and it's murder on my hip.

266
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,403
Not that I wouldn't climb
the Space Needle

267
00:12:47,642 --> 00:12:49,519
to hear her play that banjo of hers.

268
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:03,370
Clam up, boys, she's back.

269
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:05,394
You know, I keep meaning to ask

270
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,210
what's that lovely perfume
you're wearing?

271
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:09,251
Yes, I've been
wondering that myself.

272
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:10,896
It's called Milady's Boudoir.

273
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:12,716
You wouldn't believe
what a bargain it is.

274
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,348
For a hundred bucks, I could
buy enough to drown myself in.

275
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:18,123
- I've got 60.
- Yeah.

276
00:13:24,763 --> 00:13:27,914
Again, I'm sorry for not
making it over for dinner last night,

277
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:30,818
- but I had this tickle in my throat.
- Spare me your lame excuses.

278
00:13:31,102 --> 00:13:32,694
We both know why
you weren't there.

279
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:34,094
How was Sherry?

280
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:36,305
Colorful as ever.

281
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:40,373
Last night she treated us to selections
from her unpublished volume

282
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:42,253
of limericks for lovers.

283
00:13:43,782 --> 00:13:49,379
The last several about a well-traveled
man fortuitously named Horatio.

284
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:55,426
- Oh, dear God. Don't turn around.
- Who is it?

285
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,587
It's Dad, and he's
brought Sophie Tucker.

286
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,190
Oh, no.

287
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:02,023
- But this is our place.
- Don't look.

288
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,894
Hi. How are you doing?

289
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:07,453
- Look who's here.
- Hi, boys!

290
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:10,759
Oh, wow, what a cute place this is.

291
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:13,095
I walk by here all the time
and never stopped in.

292
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:14,786
Yeah, well, the boys love it here.

293
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:17,137
We should start coming here.
Make room at that table.

294
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:19,435
We'll be right back.
We're gonna get a cuppa.

295
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:21,960
Quick, Niles, pull up the ladder.

296
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:23,753
- She found our clubhouse.
- Oh.

297
00:14:27,242 --> 00:14:28,595
This can not go on.

298
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,513
You're right.

299
00:14:30,745 --> 00:14:32,383
Dad has to be politely told that

300
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:34,055
even though he may
enjoy her company,

301
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:37,123
he has no right to--
What's a polite word for "inflict"?

302
00:14:37,419 --> 00:14:39,091
I don't know,
but I'm sure you'll find one.

303
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:41,487
Me? You mean I have to
do this alone?

304
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:43,951
I thought the two of us
would sit down and talk to him--

305
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:46,094
No, no, no, no.
I'm afraid you're the one

306
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:48,255
who's going to be making
that little speech.

307
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:49,590
Niles, both of us
have a problem--

308
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:51,876
Ah, ah, ah, ah. She's not
invading my apartment.

309
00:14:52,142 --> 00:14:53,495
I can afford to be patient.

310
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,652
You are a little weasel, aren't you?

311
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,613
A little weasel
whose daddy loves him.

312
00:14:57,856 --> 00:15:00,768
Niles, before I forget.
About your banquet?

313
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:02,546
Are we talking fancy-schmancy?

314
00:15:03,445 --> 00:15:07,677
That's not exactly the way it was
worded on the invitation, but yes.

315
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:12,647
- Why?
- Well, Daphne's got a cold,

316
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,709
so Sherry's gonna use her ticket.

317
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:16,992
What fun.

318
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:20,818
That's coming up soon, isn't it?

319
00:15:21,046 --> 00:15:23,401
Maybe you should start working
on that little speech.

320
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:25,664
Ooh. So fancy dress, huh? Good.

321
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,517
I have got a backless
leopard-skin number

322
00:15:27,761 --> 00:15:30,036
that is gonna knock your eyes out.

323
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:33,566
Gotcha.

324
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:36,792
Ow!

325
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,659
I'm sorry. I'm smushing you.

326
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,611
No, that's all right.
We were just leaving.

327
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:43,211
- Ah, you gotta go?
- Yes.

328
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:45,673
Well, now, Niles, don't worry
about your banquet.

329
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,220
I'll wear a nice dress
and put on my best dancing shoes.

330
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:50,367
Well, there won't be dancing.

331
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:52,573
You just leave that to Sherry.

332
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:02,785
Well, your little banquet
should prove quite amusing.

333
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:05,040
I hope Dr. Gottfreund doesn't
aggravate his hernia

334
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:07,493
when he goes underneath
the limbo pole.

335
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:09,503
I have to talk to Dad.

336
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:12,187
I can't let her ruin the most
important evening of my life.

337
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:13,507
What do I say to him?

338
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:16,191
Frasier, you've gotta help me.

339
00:16:16,768 --> 00:16:19,407
Well, prepared though you were
to abandon me,

340
00:16:19,688 --> 00:16:21,758
and let me handle all
the dirty work alone, I will

341
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:24,093
swallow my resentment,
confront him with you tonight,

342
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:25,633
and take my share of the heat.

343
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:27,255
Thank you.

344
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:29,159
Gotcha.

345
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:35,620
So, Niles, what are you
in the mood for?

346
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:38,987
Normandy or the
Battle of the Bulge?

347
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,277
Whatever.

348
00:16:42,043 --> 00:16:45,319
What--? You've been fidgeting around
all night. Something on your mind?

349
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,746
Uh, yes, actually.

350
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:50,727
- It's about my awards banquet.
- Yeah?

351
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:52,569
Uh.

352
00:16:52,804 --> 00:16:54,556
Dad, this is very difficult to say.

353
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:56,117
Uh...

354
00:16:56,641 --> 00:16:58,632
I would really rather...

355
00:16:59,144 --> 00:17:00,213
...you didn't...

356
00:17:02,313 --> 00:17:03,382
...wear those pants.

357
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:07,580
Well, I'm not. I'm wearing that
Avanti tux you gave me.

358
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:08,930
What's your problem?

359
00:17:09,154 --> 00:17:11,065
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I guess I--

360
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:14,314
I don't know, I'm just nervous
about tomorrow night.

361
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:15,845
God knows why.

362
00:17:21,082 --> 00:17:23,277
- Evening, Dad.
- Evening.

363
00:17:26,296 --> 00:17:27,445
Something wrong?

364
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:30,140
You know, that brother of yours
can be downright insulting.

365
00:17:30,425 --> 00:17:33,815
He's so afraid someone's gonna
embarrass him at his fancy dinner.

366
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:37,679
Um, you know, Niles, uh,

367
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:40,769
told me about what he was
going to say to you tonight and, um,

368
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:43,916
well, I must say in his defense

369
00:17:44,189 --> 00:17:47,226
that it is an important evening
for him and, well, let's face it,

370
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:49,595
Sherry can be a bit much.

371
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:51,882
- She can, huh?
- Well...

372
00:17:52,113 --> 00:17:55,708
I mean, I don't mean it as a criticism,
mind you. Some people like that.

373
00:17:56,076 --> 00:17:57,828
Well, now that Niles
has broached the subject,

374
00:17:58,078 --> 00:18:02,310
I must say that I too,
find Sherry a bit brassy...

375
00:18:03,124 --> 00:18:04,352
...and flamboyant...

376
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:07,792
He didn't say a word to you, did he?

377
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:13,475
I don't believe this.
You got a problem with Sherry?

378
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,557
That delightful woman?

379
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:19,394
Oh, knock it off.

380
00:18:19,641 --> 00:18:22,872
I see you're still waiting
on that spine donor.

381
00:18:26,189 --> 00:18:28,703
Look, Dad, there is no
reason to belabor this point--

382
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:30,814
No, no. You got something to say,
let's hear it.

383
00:18:31,069 --> 00:18:32,502
You don't like her?

384
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:35,456
Please understand, Dad, as happy as
we are that you've found someone--

385
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,492
- But you don't like her.
- We're not saying that.

386
00:18:37,742 --> 00:18:40,461
She, She's just not the sort of person
that we would

387
00:18:40,745 --> 00:18:42,542
normally choose to spend time with.

388
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:44,302
In other words, you don't like her.

389
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,764
Come on, we're all grown-ups here.
Tell me the truth.

390
00:18:51,548 --> 00:18:52,981
All right, Dad, we don't like her.

391
00:18:53,425 --> 00:18:56,223
Fine. If that's the way
you feel about it, don't worry.

392
00:18:56,511 --> 00:18:57,944
I won't bring her back
here anymore.

393
00:18:58,179 --> 00:18:59,931
I guess it's too much to expect
my own family

394
00:19:00,181 --> 00:19:02,900
to make a person I care about
feel welcome.

395
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:06,486
Wait a minute!

396
00:19:07,689 --> 00:19:09,202
When did you ever make
any of the women

397
00:19:09,441 --> 00:19:10,840
we were involved with feel welcome?

398
00:19:12,193 --> 00:19:14,866
Ooh, Frasier, you're right.
He almost got away with that.

399
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:17,327
When did Lilith ever step foot
in your house

400
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:19,804
that you didn't make her feel
as wanted as a fungus?

401
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:21,350
Not to mention my Maris.

402
00:19:21,578 --> 00:19:25,048
What, you're comparing a warm lady
like Sherry to Frosty the Snow Wife?

403
00:19:25,373 --> 00:19:28,888
There! That, that, that is exactly
what I'm talking about.

404
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:30,689
Oh, you know, why don't we
just face facts?

405
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,592
I mean, since when
has any one of us ever,

406
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:35,433
from Sherry, to Lilith,
to Maris, to Diane,

407
00:19:35,717 --> 00:19:38,151
has ever been able to pick one
woman the other two could stand?

408
00:19:38,428 --> 00:19:40,225
I picked your mother.

409
00:19:42,557 --> 00:19:45,355
I'm sorry, Niles.
I've been hogging the floor.

410
00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:47,842
Um...

411
00:19:48,313 --> 00:19:49,746
Ah, forget it.

412
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,703
You're right.

413
00:19:51,983 --> 00:19:54,941
Why should I expect you to make
the effort when I'm no better?

414
00:19:55,403 --> 00:19:57,758
Hell, you probably got it from me.

415
00:19:58,031 --> 00:20:01,660
You sure didn't get it from your mother,
because she was great that way.

416
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:04,366
Anytime she ever met anybody,

417
00:20:04,621 --> 00:20:08,330
she would always find something
to like about them.

418
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,380
One of the things I loved her for.

419
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:12,345
That's one of the things
I love Sherry for.

420
00:20:12,587 --> 00:20:14,384
She's a lot like your
mother that way.

421
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:16,830
She'll always find something.

422
00:20:17,092 --> 00:20:19,128
Even with you two.

423
00:20:22,472 --> 00:20:24,110
Well, I...

424
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:25,831
...suppose we could

425
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:29,415
all afford to be a bit more open-minded
when it comes to each other's mates.

426
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:30,878
Well, at the very least,

427
00:20:31,106 --> 00:20:33,574
if we can't say anything nice,
we shouldn't say anything at all.

428
00:20:35,819 --> 00:20:38,128
We'll be having
some quiet Thanksgivings,

429
00:20:38,405 --> 00:20:40,236
but fine with me.

430
00:20:42,242 --> 00:20:43,277
- Hi, Sherry.
- Hi.

431
00:20:43,493 --> 00:20:45,882
- Don't you look nice? Come on in.
- Well, thank you, Frasier.

432
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:50,678
Oh, Marty, I brought you
one more little gift.

433
00:20:51,042 --> 00:20:53,431
- Another one?
- Well, I wanted to give it to you

434
00:20:53,712 --> 00:20:56,101
on your birthday, but it took
a while to find the right size.

435
00:20:56,381 --> 00:20:58,292
Really? I'm usually a pretty easy fit.

436
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:01,223
- Who said it's for you to wear?
- Oh-ho!

437
00:21:02,012 --> 00:21:04,367
I like it already.

438
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:05,924
Oh, I should stop.

439
00:21:06,141 --> 00:21:08,575
- I'm embarrassing your boys.
- No, you're not.

440
00:21:09,144 --> 00:21:10,133
Is she?

441
00:21:10,395 --> 00:21:12,033
No.

442
00:21:12,522 --> 00:21:14,478
- Party on.
- All right.

443
00:21:16,568 --> 00:21:19,765
Well, I think we should go
and unwrap this.

444
00:21:20,488 --> 00:21:23,161
Oh, Dad, Lilith mentioned that she was
gonna be joining Frederick

445
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:25,759
on his next visit. You don't mind
if she stays here, do you?

446
00:21:26,036 --> 00:21:28,948
Oh, Lilith? No. Great. I love Lilith.

447
00:21:29,247 --> 00:21:32,000
That's terrific.
No, she's welcome here anytime.

448
00:21:32,459 --> 00:21:35,053
Honey, you're hurting my hand.

449
00:21:38,673 --> 00:21:41,870
Oh, listen, I should mention,
I'm kind of a sleepwalker.

450
00:21:42,177 --> 00:21:44,737
So if you get up in the night,
and find me in here naked,

451
00:21:45,013 --> 00:21:48,005
just give me a good hard shake.
I'll come to in a jiff.

452
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:50,791
Ha! Ha-ha!

453
00:21:51,478 --> 00:21:53,036
Got me. Good one.

454
00:22:00,362 --> 00:22:01,351
That was great.

455
00:22:01,571 --> 00:22:04,802
- You really got them good.
- I know.
