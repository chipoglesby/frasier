1
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,792
So I decided it was time I got to know
some of my colleagues in the media.

2
00:00:13,095 --> 00:00:14,528
- But a convention?
- Mm.

3
00:00:14,805 --> 00:00:16,284
You've never shown
any interest before.

4
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:18,427
They've never held one
in Aspen before.

5
00:00:18,851 --> 00:00:23,208
Just think, hundreds of radio
psychiatrists, all in the same location.

6
00:00:23,564 --> 00:00:24,792
One well-timed avalanche

7
00:00:25,024 --> 00:00:28,619
and the dignity of the entire psychiatric
profession could be restored.

8
00:00:31,322 --> 00:00:33,233
Oh, good one.

9
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:36,244
I can always count on you
for some witty retort.

10
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:37,889
I insult you,
and you compliment me.

11
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,917
Could the request for a favor
be far behind?

12
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:42,037
Damn. You are perceptive.

13
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:44,528
- Oh, stop it.
- Oh, all right.

14
00:00:44,794 --> 00:00:48,070
Listen, Niles, I'd like you to do
my show for me for the week I'm gone.

15
00:00:48,673 --> 00:00:50,550
Me standing in for you?

16
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,030
I'm sorry, Frasier,
I couldn't presume to fill

17
00:00:53,302 --> 00:00:55,133
those big, floppy red shoes of yours.

18
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:58,786
Please, please, Niles.
Look, I'm begging you.

19
00:00:59,308 --> 00:01:01,697
The station wants to replace me
with Helen Grogan,

20
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:04,048
better known as Ma Nature.
She does a gardening show,

21
00:01:04,313 --> 00:01:07,703
and I'm just a little worried that a week
of discussing well-rotted manure

22
00:01:08,025 --> 00:01:09,981
will weaken my listener base.

23
00:01:10,903 --> 00:01:12,939
It hasn't yet.

24
00:01:14,907 --> 00:01:16,101
Very well.

25
00:01:16,325 --> 00:01:19,840
You leave me no alternative
but to call in my marker.

26
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:24,538
What marker?

27
00:01:25,459 --> 00:01:27,689
Oh, I think you know.

28
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,211
- You wouldn't.
- I would.

29
00:01:31,465 --> 00:01:32,500
- You can't.
- I will.

30
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:34,070
That was three years ago.

31
00:01:34,343 --> 00:01:36,903
I don't recall there being
any statute of limitations.

32
00:01:38,222 --> 00:01:41,134
I distinctly recall that when you asked
me to go out with Maris' sister,

33
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:45,109
you said that you would
owe me one forever.

34
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:49,025
But you only spent one evening
with Brie.

35
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:52,415
That hardly compares to what
you're asking me to endure.

36
00:01:53,112 --> 00:01:55,467
Shall I refresh your memory?

37
00:01:57,158 --> 00:02:01,993
Midway through the opera,
her ermine muff began to tremble.

38
00:02:02,371 --> 00:02:03,770
As it turned out, she had used it

39
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:06,831
to smuggle in
her adorably incontinent chihuahua.

40
00:02:07,793 --> 00:02:10,102
Just as I thought we'd reached
the low point of the evening,

41
00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:14,539
I suddenly felt a sandpaper tongue
licking my earlobe.

42
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:18,399
Alas, it did not belong to little HervÃ©.

43
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:25,031
Fortunately, my shriek coincided
with the onstage murder of Gondalfo.

44
00:02:26,979 --> 00:02:29,777
Roz will expect you on Monday at 2.

45
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:34,142
For your information, Brie had
a very tough row to hoe growing up.

46
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:37,881
It's not easy going through life
with only one nostril.

47
00:02:40,409 --> 00:02:43,162
Did I mention
she had a cold that night?

48
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:49,677
Monday at 2 it is.

49
00:02:54,131 --> 00:02:56,440
<i>We're at the point where all</i>
<i>communication has broken down.</i>

50
00:02:56,717 --> 00:02:58,230
- <i>He won't even listen to me.</i>
- Linda.

51
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:00,744
<i>Do you how annoying that is,</i>
<i>not to be listened to?</i>

52
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:02,727
- Linda.
- <i>It's driving me crazy.</i>

53
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:06,171
<i>I was hoping maybe</i>
<i>you would speak to him directly.</i>

54
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:07,713
Excuse me one moment.

55
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:11,683
Thank you for the brilliant job of
call-screening. How do I get out of this?

56
00:03:12,024 --> 00:03:15,255
Did you think of saying there are
other callers on the line?

57
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,765
Linda, I'd love to go into this
in more depth,

58
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,827
but, unfortunately,
we're nearly out of time

59
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:22,747
and Roz has lots of other callers
waiting anxiously on the line.

60
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:25,796
Actually, Dr. Crane,
all our lines are open.

61
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:29,037
<i>So you can talk to him? Good.</i>

62
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:30,846
<i>I'm putting him on the line</i>
<i>right now.</i>

63
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:33,076
- <i>Go ahead.</i>
- All right.

64
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:35,101
Murray, you're dealing
with your problem

65
00:03:35,339 --> 00:03:36,818
in a very self-destructive manner.

66
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:39,279
It won't be solved by refusing to eat.

67
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:41,110
Do you hear me?

68
00:03:44,473 --> 00:03:46,703
<i>Oh, my God, it's working.</i>
<i>He's eating.</i>

69
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:49,206
<i>Dr. Crane, what did you say to him?</i>

70
00:03:49,478 --> 00:03:53,596
Well, I'd like to tell you, but that would
violate doctor-cat confidentiality.

71
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:56,103
Oh, well, Seattle,
I'm afraid we're out of time.

72
00:03:56,402 --> 00:04:00,031
This is Dr. Niles Crane, one down,
four to go. See you tomorrow.

73
00:04:02,366 --> 00:04:04,596
That little bit of sabotage
was not amusing.

74
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:07,061
Then why did coffee
come out of my nose?

75
00:04:10,082 --> 00:04:13,358
Hey, Dr. Dolittle,
I heard your show.

76
00:04:13,669 --> 00:04:16,706
- It didn't suck.
- "Dear diary..."

77
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:18,200
So how's it feel?

78
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:20,969
Like I'm walking away
from my lamppost

79
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:23,449
and counting the bills
in my garter belt.

80
00:04:25,389 --> 00:04:27,823
Okay, both of you get out of here.
I gotta set up for my show.

81
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:31,179
I got Reggie MacLemore
on my show today. Don't ask me why.

82
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:34,115
- I wasn't even going to ask who.
- He's a guard for the Sonics.

83
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,908
He used to be unstoppable.
Twenty points a game, easy.

84
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:38,509
Now he's in the tank.

85
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:40,609
Just what I need on my show,
a loser.

86
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:42,296
Oh, look, there he is now.

87
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:44,204
What an overpaid, worthless
piece of...

88
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:48,841
- Hey, Reggie, my man!
- What's up? How you doing, man?

89
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,219
You never call me unless you need
tickets, man. What's up with that?

90
00:04:54,126 --> 00:04:55,525
I love this guy.

91
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:58,696
Reggie MacLemore, Roz Doyle.

92
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,877
- Hi. I'm a big fan of yours.
- Thanks.

93
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:05,210
I'd introduce you to this guy, but
he doesn't know squat about sports.

94
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:08,115
On the contrary. In prep school,
I was an ardent sportsman.

95
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:11,940
Until an inflamed instep forced me
to resign from the croquet club.

96
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:17,108
I'll see myself out.

97
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:19,030
Oh, hey, wait a minute.
You're the shrink.

98
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:21,233
I heard you in my car
on the way over.

99
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,205
Dr. Niles Crane. It's a pleasure.

100
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:26,208
Doc, wait. You sounded like you
really know what you're talking about.

101
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:28,608
Anyway, there's this sort of problem
I've been having,

102
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,906
and I was wondering...
Maybe you could help me out.

103
00:05:31,163 --> 00:05:32,278
Well, what is it?

104
00:05:32,748 --> 00:05:35,103
Well, you see,
for the last two weeks,

105
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:38,766
every time I get my hands
on the pill, I choke.

106
00:05:39,755 --> 00:05:42,986
Well, have you tried mashing it
with a spoon?

107
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:45,841
You don't watch much basketball,
do you?

108
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:49,007
It's my game, man.
Because of me, we've lost six in a row.

109
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:52,033
Oh, well, I'm not very well versed
in sports psychology,

110
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,902
but I could certainly schedule
a session.

111
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:57,432
No, no, I need something fast, man.
We got Phoenix tonight.

112
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,848
This is highly irregular,
but since you're pressed,

113
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:01,508
there are exercises I could suggest.

114
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:02,851
Oh, great, man. Thanks, man.

115
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:05,342
You know what, just name it.
Tickets to any game you want.

116
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:08,083
Nothing wrong with your sense
of humor. Have a seat.

117
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:12,353
We'll start with a positive visualization.

118
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:15,090
I want you to close your eyes,
take a deep breath.

119
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:21,339
Good. Now, I want you to imagine
yourself on the playing surface,

120
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:24,425
doing whatever it is you actually do.

121
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:26,275
Tell me what you see.

122
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:29,548
- Okay. Kemp's passing me the ball.
- Mm-hm.

123
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:31,803
- I'm bringing it up court.
- Mm-hm.

124
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,367
- I'm dribbling.
- Don't worry about your appearance.

125
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:38,204
Start again, and I'll just be quiet.

126
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:43,353
- Can I ask you a favor?
- Yeah, forget it, he's married.

127
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:45,769
Hey, that's pretty offensive.

128
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,941
Why do you assume
that's what I wanted?

129
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:50,315
Okay, then, what did you want?

130
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,055
Well, I don't know, I just wanted to--

131
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:54,531
Time's up.

132
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:58,623
Oh, by the way, if you're so hungry
for some good-looking, athletic guy,

133
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,552
why won't you go out with me?

134
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:04,318
If you're not at least this tall,
you can't go on this ride.

135
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:09,281
This next exercise is designed
to block negative feelings.

136
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:11,784
I've tried it myself.
Simply take a moment,

137
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,487
think of something comforting
from childhood:

138
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:17,804
A stuffed animal,
a dog-eared copy of <i>Middlemarch</i>.

139
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:21,069
You may have other memories.

140
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:22,631
Come on, Reggie, shake it.

141
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,494
I gotta run. Hey, but thanks
a lot, doc. I'll give it a try.

142
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:29,327
Okay. Oh, wait, I saw this.
It has steps, right?

143
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:33,536
Later, man.

144
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:38,473
- You know, according to this article--
- No, quiet.

145
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:42,420
That's three seconds. Come on,
he's camping out in the middle.

146
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:46,105
No, don't double the ball.
They'll just swing it around for a three.

147
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:49,146
There it is. Just like I said.

148
00:07:49,468 --> 00:07:51,106
Oh!

149
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:55,411
Oh, timeout.
Sure, now you listen to me.

150
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:58,997
You believe this? Two minutes ago,
we were up six points--

151
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,784
Shh! Quiet. This is my
favorite commercial.

152
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:07,628
No, don't pick that floor cleaner.
It'll give your floors waxy build-up.

153
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:11,339
No, don't do it. Don't do it!
Dahh!

154
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:16,143
It's completely different.

155
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,945
There's Dr. Crane.

156
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:23,204
It'll be a pleasure to be around one
man who's not obsessed with sports.

157
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:25,898
- Hello, Daphne.
- Hello.

158
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:27,882
Oh, the Sonics are on, excuse me.

159
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:29,611
- So, Dad--
- Hold it, Niles.

160
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:31,161
There's only nine seconds to go.

161
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:32,985
- What's the score?
- What do you care?

162
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:34,734
No, get it to MacLemore,
to MacLemore.

163
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:36,291
He's got the hot hand.

164
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:38,601
Yes! Come on, Reggie!

165
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:41,612
Unbelievable. Sonics win!

166
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:44,930
- This is fantastic. You know, Dad--
- Wait, wait. I wanna see the replay.

167
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:47,110
No, get it to MacLemore.

168
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:49,039
Unbelievable!

169
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:54,117
- You might be interested to know--
- Quiet, I wanna see the interview.

170
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:55,557
<i>Reggie, got a minute?</i>

171
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:58,021
<i>Great game tonight.</i>
<i>Seems like your slump is over.</i>

172
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:00,118
<i>Yeah, I was really feeling it</i>
<i>out there tonight.</i>

173
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,409
<i>What turned it around for you?</i>

174
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:05,268
<i>Well, I was having a little problem</i>
<i>getting my head together,</i>

175
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:08,059
<i>but this radio shrink really</i>
<i>helped me out. Dr. Niles Crane.</i>

176
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:10,694
- <i>Well, good luck against Utah.</i>
- <i>Thanks a lot.</i>

177
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,525
<i>Let's send it back upstairs.</i>

178
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:18,046
You?

179
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:22,676
- Is that so hard to believe?
- Yeah.

180
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:26,270
- When did you talk to him?
- He was on Bulldog's show today.

181
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:29,246
We had a brief session in the hallway.
Not more than two minutes.

182
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:32,041
You turned Reggie's game around
in only two minutes?

183
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:34,039
Well, you could be
a little less surprised.

184
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:36,238
I am a skilled psychiatrist.

185
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:40,326
After 16 years in the field,
I have developed certain instincts.

186
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:42,423
I gotta say, I'm impressed.

187
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:44,982
I'm starting to think maybe
I should spend an hour or two

188
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,401
on the couch with you.

189
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:51,056
Are you kidding?
With Niles, it'd only take two minutes.

190
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:59,219
Thanks, Dad.

191
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:09,240
Hey, doc, great job. Go Sonics.

192
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:12,835
- You're the man.
- Thank you. Same to you.

193
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:14,955
<i>Way to go.</i>

194
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:17,678
Heavens, I need a clip and a buff.

195
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:21,985
There he is, the toast of Seattle.

196
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:25,086
You know you made the sports section
of the paper this morning?

197
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:28,772
Yes, I'd heard. I must admit,
I find this all a bit mystifying.

198
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:31,395
Do people really care this much
about a basketball game?

199
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:34,505
Are you kidding? This is Seattle.
It rains nine months out of the year.

200
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:37,037
We take our indoor sports
very seriously.

201
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:39,381
Well, I know you always have.

202
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:43,810
You're a hero today,
so I'm gonna let that one go.

203
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:47,499
Pucker up, baby,
I'm planting a big, wet one on you.

204
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:49,736
Muah!

205
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:55,064
Well, there's a layer of skin
I'll be exfoliating this evening.

206
00:10:56,489 --> 00:11:00,641
- I had 200 bucks on the Sonics.
- Two hundred? Isn't gambling illegal?

207
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:02,585
- Isn't he the cutest?
- Oh, yes.

208
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:04,606
- Down. Down.
- Okay.

209
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,628
I hope you don't feel this way
about chicks.

210
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,384
I got one of those Sonics cheerleaders
coming on my show today,

211
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,182
and she really wants to see you.

212
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:14,093
Believe it or not, Bulldog,
not every man's dream woman

213
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:17,381
is a pompom-shaking,
half-time halfwit.

214
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:19,231
Is she the head cheerleader?

215
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:22,523
Yeah, and she's coming in costume.

216
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:25,204
Of course she is. It's radio.

217
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,167
Look at these faxes
that came for you.

218
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:32,070
Faxes?

219
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,050
"Seattle thanks you."

220
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:39,267
"You're the Sonics' MVP."

221
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:41,731
- Most valuable player.
- Oh!

222
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:45,306
"You're a genius."

223
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:48,735
With the less-common J spelling.
But still, his point is well taken.

224
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,320
I bet you're feeling pretty good
about yourself.

225
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:53,982
Suddenly I'm being revered as a god
by the same troglodytes

226
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:57,213
who in junior high school tried to
pack me into my own briefcase.

227
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:59,305
It's glorious.

228
00:11:59,594 --> 00:12:01,425
Oh, I almost forgot the best part.

229
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:04,883
Reggie sent these tickets
for tonight's game over.

230
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:07,947
Well, I suppose I can't disappoint
my new fans.

231
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:10,218
Tell me, does one still wear
a white sweater

232
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:12,231
jauntily tied around the neck
to these things?

233
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:15,473
If one wants to get the crap
beat out of one.

234
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:19,913
- Hey.
- Dad. What a surprise.

235
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,797
I'm not interrupting or anything, am I?

236
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:24,304
- No, come in. Is everything all right?
- Oh, sure, sure.

237
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,056
I was just having lunch at McGinty's,

238
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:28,326
and some of the guys would
really like to meet you,

239
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:31,300
and I was hoping that after your show,
you could stop in for a drink.

240
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:35,062
I mean, I wouldn't ask you, but some
of these guys are my best buddies.

241
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,889
Actually, Dad, Reggie sent over
these tickets to tonight's game,

242
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:40,051
and I was going to ask you to go,
but since--

243
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:42,777
The hell with those guys. I'm there.

244
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:46,346
I have to tell you, I'm finding
all this attention a bit overwhelming.

245
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:49,799
Oh, come on, you deserve it.
You're a hero.

246
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:52,100
Perhaps it's time
we put all this into perspective.

247
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:54,232
The only real heroes are
the fine athletes

248
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:56,438
who worked so hard
for two hours to win that game.

249
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:58,410
My contribution was minimal at best.

250
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:00,180
What did I tell you, doc?

251
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:02,201
Which of you won the game
for us last night?

252
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,003
That would be me.

253
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:15,367
Nice talking to you too.
Enjoy the game.

254
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:19,245
Dad, it really isn't necessary to tell
everyone we bump into

255
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:23,019
that I'm the one
Reggie credited with last night's victory.

256
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:27,417
- That was you?
- Yeah, yeah, it's my son, Niles Crane.

257
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:32,000
They must've sold too many tickets.

258
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:34,219
They've stuck us
in these folding chairs.

259
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,996
Wow, we're right on the hardwood,
five feet from the baseline.

260
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,749
- Like front-row orchestra, stage right.
- Oh.

261
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:49,291
Oh, man, we're so close we're gonna
hear teeth rattle when they set a pick.

262
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:55,142
It's like sitting close enough
to get hit by Placido Domingo's spit.

263
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:56,494
Oh.

264
00:13:57,461 --> 00:14:00,453
- Hey, hey, N.C., you made it.
- I beg your pardon?

265
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:03,270
Oh, "N.C." I thought you said "nancy."

266
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:06,960
For a second it was prep school
all over again. Let me introduce.

267
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,742
Reggie MacLemore, Daphne Moon.

268
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:10,088
- Hello.
- And this--

269
00:14:10,308 --> 00:14:12,538
Hi. Marty Crane. Niles' dad.

270
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,046
Yeah, I'm a big fan.

271
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,306
I want you to know,
I never lost faith in you.

272
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:19,362
Not when you were in your slump,
not when you tanked it in the playoffs,

273
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:23,689
not even when all my friends
were calling you Reggie Hack-Lemore.

274
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,883
What?

275
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:27,514
You know, this might be
a good time

276
00:14:27,742 --> 00:14:29,858
to try that negative-thought-blocking
exercise.

277
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:32,713
Yeah, okay. Look, you guys enjoy
the game. I'll see you afterwards.

278
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:35,875
- All right. Make me proud.
- Go Sonics.

279
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,934
- What the hell was that?
- That's the end of the shootaround.

280
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:45,525
The coach is about to send
the starting five in for the tip-off.

281
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:49,153
- The stage manager just called places.
- Oh.

282
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:55,998
<i>Foul on the rebound, MacLemore.</i>

283
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:58,826
I gather Reggie's not performing
up to par this evening.

284
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:00,740
Oh, you got that from
all the booing, huh?

285
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:04,100
Nice counseling job.
He's been throwing up bricks all night.

286
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,394
Judging from that empty tureen
of nachos and cheese,

287
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:08,533
you may be joining him.

288
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:11,544
<i>Malone to the line to shoot two.</i>

289
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:13,898
Doc, you gotta help me out.
I don't know what's wrong.

290
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:16,393
Perhaps you've forgotten my advice.
Let's review quickly.

291
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,497
Did you empty your mind
of negative thoughts?

292
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:19,942
- Yeah.
- The imaging exercises?

293
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:22,524
Yeah, yeah, I did them.
What else did you tell me to do?

294
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:25,114
Nothing. Bulldog called you,
you ran back in.

295
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:27,943
No, no, wait. Now, right before that,
I rubbed your head.

296
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:29,971
I remember because my hand
smelled like peach

297
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:32,689
and I thought, "What the hell
does this guy wash his hair with?"

298
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:36,338
Well, you can't possibly think that
my head is some sort of lucky charm.

299
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:38,836
Well, we'll know in a minute.

300
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:44,697
I saw you talking to Reggie again.
Hope you gave him some more advice.

301
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:46,578
I tried to, but he has
this absurd idea--

302
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:48,459
No, wait, wait, wait.

303
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:52,209
<i>MacLemore for three.</i>

304
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:54,795
Unbelievable.
What did you say to him?

305
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:56,671
I didn't say anything
he could possibly--

306
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:58,745
Look, look, look, he stole the ball.

307
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:01,692
<i>MacLemore, three more.</i>

308
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,350
Oh, Dr. Crane,
you're a miracle worker.

309
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,109
What did you say to him?

310
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:09,537
Oh, just something off the top
of my head.

311
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:13,226
<i>Timeout, Utah.</i>

312
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:18,128
Oh, isn't this nice.

313
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:20,582
Dr. Crane sent us a postcard
from Aspen.

314
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:22,573
Great. How's he doing?

315
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:23,930
Let's see.

316
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,584
"I delivered a speech
at the conference last night.

317
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:29,576
I was especially pleased
with my opening line:

318
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:33,376
'My fellow psychiatrists. As I watched
you on the slopes today,

319
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:38,058
I realized I've never seen
so many Freudians slip.'

320
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:44,886
As hard as you're laughing now,

321
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:48,246
imagine the thunder
of an auditorium of colleagues.

322
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:50,619
Well, see you Saturday. Frasier."

323
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:55,715
Well, I better get going.
I'm meeting Joe at the movies.

324
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:58,089
Oh, bloody hell,
it's later than I thought.

325
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:00,865
- Enjoy.
- Yeah. Enjoy your game.

326
00:17:01,312 --> 00:17:03,826
Oh, Dr. Crane,
have fun at the game.

327
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:06,745
- I'm afraid we won't be going.
- Oh, that's too bad.

328
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:08,660
- Do you wanna know why?
- Not really.

329
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:14,587
VIP parking. Uh-huh.

330
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:19,869
Yeah, that's courtside, pal.
Yeah, right on the hardwood.

331
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:21,886
Yeah, swear to God.

332
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:25,078
And Reggie said the seats are ours
for the rest of the season.

333
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:29,799
I believe it's what they call
"living large."

334
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:34,065
I don't know. Somewhere on TV.

335
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:37,026
Yeah. Yeah, okay.
Yeah, I gotta go. Bye.

336
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:38,534
Let's go, Niles.

337
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,643
You know, Dad, I was thinking,

338
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,372
maybe we shouldn't go
to the game today.

339
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,862
Hey, you know what I was thinking?
Maybe we shouldn't go to any of them.

340
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:53,235
You know, that's one of
the best things about this.

341
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:55,559
When was the last time
you and I joked like this?

342
00:17:55,867 --> 00:17:58,222
Well, we better get going,
because it's late.

343
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,212
Last night at the game...

344
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:03,014
...did you happen to notice
when Reggie tousled my hair?

345
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:04,526
Yeah, yeah. Let's go.

346
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:08,504
Well, somehow, some way,
he's convinced himself that

347
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:11,068
that's what he needs to do
in order to play well.

348
00:18:11,382 --> 00:18:13,100
Oh, well, can't we talk about it
in the car?

349
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:15,219
It has nothing to do with
any advice I've given.

350
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:17,221
It's all some bizarre superstition,

351
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:20,827
and Reggie wants to rub my head
again before today's game.

352
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:24,153
Well, you know, a lot of athletes
have weird superstitions.

353
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:27,235
Yes, but I'm a psychiatrist.

354
00:18:28,316 --> 00:18:30,113
I can't let people think
I'm treating the man

355
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:33,078
when all I am is a rabbit's foot.

356
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:35,592
I'd be taking credit for something
I don't deserve.

357
00:18:35,907 --> 00:18:39,104
Okay. What would you be taking
credit for? Helping him.

358
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:42,967
What are you doing? Helping him.
I'm getting my coat.

359
00:18:43,331 --> 00:18:45,845
But I wouldn't be helping him
as a psychiatrist.

360
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:49,003
Oh, that's what's bugging you? People
thinking you're a good psychiatrist?

361
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:50,967
- Exactly.
- Are you a good psychiatrist?

362
00:18:51,214 --> 00:18:53,523
- Yes.
- I'm getting my coat.

363
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:56,446
Dad, Dad, I'm sorry.

364
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,539
We're not going.

365
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:04,212
Oh, man, I knew you'd find
some way to ruin this.

366
00:19:04,602 --> 00:19:05,876
Dad.

367
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:09,539
Courtside season tickets.
VIP parking.

368
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:10,892
Dad.

369
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:13,702
No, no, you've gotta have
your reasons.

370
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:18,980
"It's my ethics. It's my integrity.
It's my allergies."

371
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:23,109
Well, that's it.
I'm never getting my hopes up again.

372
00:19:23,454 --> 00:19:25,126
Dad, you can still watch the game
on TV.

373
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:27,928
I don't wanna watch it on TV.

374
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:31,568
- I'll get you a beer.
- I don't like beer.

375
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,985
Dad, you know I'm right.

376
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:41,631
Will you look me in the eye
and answer me one question?

377
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:46,174
Would you still be doing this if these
were courtside seats at the opera?

378
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:49,480
Yes.

379
00:19:49,981 --> 00:19:51,494
My ethics are my ethics.

380
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:54,083
And by the way,
where do you think I got those ethics?

381
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,113
Oh, yeah, throw it back at me.

382
00:19:57,405 --> 00:19:59,521
That's real mature.

383
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:08,636
I'd like to talk to Mr. MacLemore.

384
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:11,988
- Who wants to see him?
- Just tell him N.C. is here.

385
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:14,804
Nancy?

386
00:20:18,092 --> 00:20:20,367
No, N.C.

387
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:25,804
What is so hard about that?

388
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:31,773
Damn, man, where've you been?
I gotta be on the court in five minutes.

389
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,294
I know, I know. Stop.

390
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,987
Before you rub your hands all over me,
we need to talk.

391
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:40,315
- What's up?
- Well, I'll come right to the point.

392
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:44,282
This entire affair has grown
out of control. I need to end it.

393
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,571
What are you saying,
you're not coming anymore?

394
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:48,023
Well, no.

395
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:51,922
We can still see each other to talk,
but no touching.

396
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:56,506
That part of our relationship is over.

397
00:20:57,381 --> 00:21:00,817
- Does this concern you?
- It's starting to.

398
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:05,451
- All right, come on, dude.
- No. Now, listen.

399
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:08,154
Do you really expect me to drop
what I'm doing

400
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:09,662
and race down here every day

401
00:21:09,894 --> 00:21:12,727
just so you can run your fingers
over my head?

402
00:21:13,356 --> 00:21:14,994
Yeah.

403
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:17,466
Listen to me closely.

404
00:21:17,735 --> 00:21:20,533
You are a gifted athlete
with tremendous skill.

405
00:21:20,863 --> 00:21:24,378
Marshal your talents.
Concentrate. Focus.

406
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:28,534
The key to your success
is to trust your own God-given ability.

407
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:30,426
It has nothing to do with my head.

408
00:21:31,082 --> 00:21:33,277
- It must be your hair.
- Will you stop it.

409
00:21:33,543 --> 00:21:37,502
- You're obsessing.
- Come on, man, just let me touch it.

410
00:21:40,675 --> 00:21:42,188
No.

411
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:44,398
You have to look at this logically.

412
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:46,116
I can't come down here
for every game,

413
00:21:46,347 --> 00:21:48,702
and I certainly can't go with you
when the team is on tour.

414
00:21:48,975 --> 00:21:50,693
This is not a long-term solution.

415
00:21:50,977 --> 00:21:52,808
What you need is legitimate therapy.

416
00:21:53,104 --> 00:21:54,378
If you wanna start, come inside.

417
00:21:54,605 --> 00:21:57,438
I'll give you a quick session,
we can proceed from there.

418
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:01,256
Yeah, you're right, doc. I mean,
what I need is a long-term solution.

419
00:22:01,612 --> 00:22:03,125
Good.

420
00:22:03,531 --> 00:22:05,567
Yo, Frank, let me see those scissors.

421
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:07,736
Coming, doc.
