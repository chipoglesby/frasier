1
00:00:10,687 --> 00:00:13,076
Have you noticed there are fewer
hazelnuts in these biscotti?

2
00:00:13,727 --> 00:00:15,319
Then I'm not crazy.

3
00:00:15,487 --> 00:00:17,443
And yet they've gone up 25 cents.

4
00:00:17,607 --> 00:00:19,245
Fewer nuts, more money.

5
00:00:19,407 --> 00:00:22,365
Something I've been aspiring to
my entire professional life.

6
00:00:24,487 --> 00:00:26,125
[PANTING]

7
00:00:26,967 --> 00:00:31,006
God, that is the last time
I jog in these shorts.

8
00:00:31,167 --> 00:00:34,603
My thighs are chafing like a couple
of hams wrapped in Velcro.

9
00:00:36,007 --> 00:00:38,043
Non-fat mocha, please.

10
00:00:42,327 --> 00:00:43,601
What?

11
00:00:43,767 --> 00:00:46,042
As flattered as we are that
you've chosen our company over,

12
00:00:46,207 --> 00:00:47,765
oh, say, a shower...

13
00:00:48,967 --> 00:00:51,606
...perhaps you'd like to go to the
ladies' room to freshen up a bit?

14
00:00:51,767 --> 00:00:54,440
Hey, at least I try
to keep in shape.

15
00:00:54,607 --> 00:00:56,837
I haven't seen either one of you
run an eight-minute mile.

16
00:00:57,007 --> 00:00:58,998
Stand upwind of us and you might.

17
00:01:01,967 --> 00:01:04,765
Oh, by the way, Niles, my benefit
for the Seattle Theatre Ensemble

18
00:01:04,927 --> 00:01:06,679
is tonight. I haven't
received your check yet.

19
00:01:06,847 --> 00:01:08,678
That's because I'm still
not sure if I'm coming.

20
00:01:08,847 --> 00:01:10,963
Whom should I expect
to meet there?

21
00:01:11,367 --> 00:01:13,801
Professional people
around our age.

22
00:01:14,527 --> 00:01:16,358
- A certain social standing.
- Yes.

23
00:01:16,527 --> 00:01:18,085
Civic-minded,
interested in the arts...

24
00:01:18,247 --> 00:01:19,965
Oh, for God's sake,
how many women?

25
00:01:20,127 --> 00:01:21,162
Why didn't you just say so?

26
00:01:21,327 --> 00:01:23,124
Well, I thought my
rutting-monkey body language

27
00:01:23,287 --> 00:01:24,879
would have tipped you off.

28
00:01:26,167 --> 00:01:27,520
Well, judging from my RSVP list,

29
00:01:27,687 --> 00:01:29,405
there should be quite
a few available women.

30
00:01:29,567 --> 00:01:31,523
Well, in that case, I'll be there.

31
00:01:31,687 --> 00:01:34,281
Here's my money.
Better be worth my while.

32
00:01:34,767 --> 00:01:36,359
Oh, look, here comes
Sherry and Dad.

33
00:01:36,527 --> 00:01:38,085
- Duck.
- No, no, it's all right.

34
00:01:38,247 --> 00:01:40,158
- I invited them.
- Sherry's not going to be there

35
00:01:40,327 --> 00:01:42,124
at your benefit is she?
I can stop that check.

36
00:01:42,287 --> 00:01:43,879
Just relax, Niles.

37
00:01:44,167 --> 00:01:47,079
I've come up with rather an ingenious
plan to occupy their evening tonight.

38
00:01:47,447 --> 00:01:50,325
I bought them tickets to an event
that's right up their alley.

39
00:01:50,487 --> 00:01:52,125
God, I was so mortified
buying the tickets,

40
00:01:52,287 --> 00:01:54,517
I paid cash so they
couldn't trace it back to me.

41
00:01:55,527 --> 00:01:57,563
- Sherry, Dad. Hi.
REBECCA: Excuse me, people.

42
00:01:57,727 --> 00:01:59,206
Did somebody leave
some tickets here?

43
00:01:59,367 --> 00:02:01,722
- Oh, Lord. Yes!
- Something called "Nashville on Ice,

44
00:02:01,887 --> 00:02:04,321
- Yes, right here.
- The All-Skating Country Jamboree"?

45
00:02:04,487 --> 00:02:07,081
Yeah, well.
Well, don't look so smug.

46
00:02:07,247 --> 00:02:09,841
You try skating and blowing into
a jug when your heart's breaking.

47
00:02:11,207 --> 00:02:13,596
I can't believe you
scored tickets to that.

48
00:02:13,767 --> 00:02:16,361
You are well-connected
in this town.

49
00:02:16,527 --> 00:02:18,836
Well, yes, actually,
these are a gift for you and Dad.

50
00:02:19,007 --> 00:02:20,884
- Oh, my God.
- I hope you're free this evening.

51
00:02:21,047 --> 00:02:23,402
Well, we are now.
Wow, Frasier, thanks!

52
00:02:23,567 --> 00:02:25,876
Look at this. Rink side!

53
00:02:26,127 --> 00:02:28,402
Niles, what's that on your cheek?

54
00:02:28,567 --> 00:02:29,886
Oh, what?

55
00:02:30,047 --> 00:02:31,526
My lips.

56
00:02:35,887 --> 00:02:37,843
Oh, look at the time.
I have to go.

57
00:02:38,007 --> 00:02:41,317
Oh, it seems like every time
I see you, you're just leaving.

58
00:02:41,487 --> 00:02:44,126
Yes, and I'd love to stay,
but I have my therapy group meeting,

59
00:02:44,287 --> 00:02:46,596
and last time I was late,
the compulsive gamblers

60
00:02:46,767 --> 00:02:48,120
were betting
the passive-aggressives

61
00:02:48,287 --> 00:02:50,517
that they couldn't
make the overeaters cry.

62
00:02:51,647 --> 00:02:53,797
If you wanna wait here,
I'll get us a couple of coffees.

63
00:02:53,967 --> 00:02:55,605
You know how I like it.
Hot and sweet!

64
00:02:55,767 --> 00:02:57,485
Yeah, but how do
you like your coffee?

65
00:02:59,807 --> 00:03:02,765
- Is he always that funny?
- Oh, yes.

66
00:03:04,687 --> 00:03:05,881
Oh.

67
00:03:06,047 --> 00:03:07,560
It's that damn soap dispenser.

68
00:03:07,727 --> 00:03:09,922
I just gave it a good
pump, and splat.

69
00:03:10,087 --> 00:03:12,123
Oh, I'm sorry.
Roz Doyle, my producer.

70
00:03:12,287 --> 00:03:14,403
You haven't met Dad's
<i>inamorata</i> Sherry Dempsey.

71
00:03:14,567 --> 00:03:15,761
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

72
00:03:15,927 --> 00:03:17,565
I normally look
a lot better than this.

73
00:03:17,727 --> 00:03:20,924
Oh, now, you don't have to be
self-conscious around me, hon.

74
00:03:21,087 --> 00:03:24,159
We all have our bad days
once we pass 40.

75
00:03:25,087 --> 00:03:26,964
It was nice seeing you.

76
00:03:27,527 --> 00:03:29,677
- What did she say?
- Oh, who cares?

77
00:03:29,847 --> 00:03:31,997
It's the least I can do to string
together a few moments

78
00:03:32,167 --> 00:03:33,486
of silence
without her underfoot.

79
00:03:33,647 --> 00:03:36,320
My God, the woman's
practically moved in with me.

80
00:03:36,527 --> 00:03:38,518
What did she say?

81
00:03:38,687 --> 00:03:40,359
Oh, Roz, take heart.
Now come on, listen,

82
00:03:40,967 --> 00:03:42,958
you may not look your best today,
but you know what?

83
00:03:43,127 --> 00:03:46,005
There's a man sitting right over there
who can't keep his eyes off of you.

84
00:03:46,167 --> 00:03:48,920
- Oh, where?
- Right there.

85
00:03:52,447 --> 00:03:53,721
Oh, my God.

86
00:03:53,887 --> 00:03:55,764
That's John Coughlin
from my high school.

87
00:03:55,927 --> 00:03:58,122
Oh, dear God, please
don't let him recognize me.

88
00:03:58,287 --> 00:04:01,120
I swear I'll never leave
the house unbeautiful again.

89
00:04:01,287 --> 00:04:03,323
- Roz?
- Thanks for listening.

90
00:04:04,367 --> 00:04:07,518
Roz Doyle?
It's me. John Coughlin.

91
00:04:08,367 --> 00:04:09,641
Hi, John.

92
00:04:09,807 --> 00:04:12,321
- Look at you.
- Look at you.

93
00:04:12,487 --> 00:04:15,559
I hardly recognized you
with that moustache.

94
00:04:16,167 --> 00:04:18,362
- Roz...
- Oh, Frasier, I'm so sorry.

95
00:04:18,807 --> 00:04:20,923
This is John Coughlin,
Frasier Crane.

96
00:04:21,087 --> 00:04:23,157
- Hello.
- So did you just move to Seattle?

97
00:04:23,327 --> 00:04:24,919
No, I've been here
for a week on business.

98
00:04:25,087 --> 00:04:26,998
Now it's back to Racine.
Remember Marcie?

99
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:28,759
- Yeah.
- She's getting married Saturday.

100
00:04:28,927 --> 00:04:30,804
- No kidding.
- Well, I'm late for a meeting,

101
00:04:30,967 --> 00:04:33,083
but it was great running into you.
I can't wait to tell

102
00:04:33,247 --> 00:04:35,807
- the whole gang I saw you.
- You don't have to do that.

103
00:04:37,047 --> 00:04:40,198
Frasier, that guy was the
biggest gossip in my hometown.

104
00:04:40,367 --> 00:04:43,677
He saw me with my hair all sweaty
and my sweatshirt full of soap.

105
00:04:43,847 --> 00:04:45,485
Oh, God, what could be worse?

106
00:04:45,647 --> 00:04:47,126
Well, here's a hint.

107
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,959
Got milk?

108
00:04:50,367 --> 00:04:52,039
Oh, my God.

109
00:04:56,887 --> 00:04:59,276
FRASIER: As a rule I'm terribly
nervous hosting these things,

110
00:04:59,447 --> 00:05:01,278
but it seems to be going well,
doesn't it?

111
00:05:01,447 --> 00:05:04,803
Not for me. I haven't made
inroads with a single woman here.

112
00:05:06,287 --> 00:05:07,515
Ooh! Ooh!

113
00:05:08,527 --> 00:05:10,404
What are you doing?
You look nauseated.

114
00:05:10,567 --> 00:05:13,877
That woman is flirting with me.
This is my "I'm available" face.

115
00:05:15,967 --> 00:05:19,164
Well, stop it. My God,
people will think the shrimp are bad.

116
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:22,878
- All right, which one?
- At 9 o'clock

117
00:05:23,047 --> 00:05:25,197
blond hair, blue dress.
Now 10 o'clock, 11 o'clock.

118
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:28,006
- Oh, mama, high noon.
- Oh, dear.

119
00:05:28,167 --> 00:05:29,486
I'm sorry, I have to leave early.

120
00:05:29,647 --> 00:05:31,717
I wanted to let you know
what a lovely time I've had.

121
00:05:31,887 --> 00:05:34,321
Well, thank you, Adair.
It was good to see you.

122
00:05:34,487 --> 00:05:37,047
Adair Peck, my brother,
Dr Niles Crane.

123
00:05:37,207 --> 00:05:39,562
- Enchanted.
- Hi.

124
00:05:39,727 --> 00:05:41,285
Are you feeling okay?

125
00:05:42,367 --> 00:05:44,278
Bad shrimp.

126
00:05:47,527 --> 00:05:49,677
I so enjoyed our chat
about Brecht.

127
00:05:49,847 --> 00:05:51,678
I'm just sorry
we didn't get to finish it.

128
00:05:51,847 --> 00:05:53,519
Well, me too.

129
00:05:53,967 --> 00:05:58,404
I never do this, but if you'd like to
give me a call sometime, I'd like that.

130
00:05:58,567 --> 00:06:00,364
You don't have to call me.
Only if you want to.

131
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:03,087
And we can talk
about other non-Brecht things.

132
00:06:03,247 --> 00:06:05,317
- Of course.
- You see why I never do this.

133
00:06:05,487 --> 00:06:07,921
Well, I'm certainly glad
that you did it with me.

134
00:06:08,407 --> 00:06:10,875
Nice meeting you, Miles.

135
00:06:16,607 --> 00:06:17,926
Dr Crane.

136
00:06:18,407 --> 00:06:20,796
Who's that gentleman over there?

137
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:23,841
That's Matthew Pinnick, one of
the theatre's biggest benefactors.

138
00:06:24,007 --> 00:06:25,963
Well, I just caught him
back in my bedroom.

139
00:06:26,127 --> 00:06:28,197
Well, I'm sure he just
wandered in there by mistake.

140
00:06:28,367 --> 00:06:30,358
He was trying on my shoes.

141
00:06:33,687 --> 00:06:35,006
[INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE]

142
00:06:37,727 --> 00:06:39,524
An interesting piece of information.

143
00:06:39,687 --> 00:06:42,406
Something tells me the theatre's
going to get that new sound system.

144
00:06:42,567 --> 00:06:44,046
KIMBERLY:
Excuse me.

145
00:06:44,247 --> 00:06:47,045
On behalf of the
Seattle Theatre Ensemble,

146
00:06:47,207 --> 00:06:51,041
I would like to thank Dr Frasier
Crane for hosting tonight's benefit.

147
00:06:51,207 --> 00:06:52,845
But before we say good night,

148
00:06:53,007 --> 00:06:56,363
let's try and coax him
into saying a few words.

149
00:07:00,247 --> 00:07:01,965
All right.

150
00:07:06,007 --> 00:07:08,077
Alexander Pope

151
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:10,084
once wrote...

152
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:16,126
...that the theatre aspires to wake
the soul by tender strokes of art.

153
00:07:16,287 --> 00:07:18,164
To raise the genius,

154
00:07:18,327 --> 00:07:20,158
and to mend the heart.

155
00:07:21,247 --> 00:07:24,000
I'd like to say that it's my privilege
to help ensure

156
00:07:24,167 --> 00:07:26,681
the survival
of this noble calling.

157
00:07:26,887 --> 00:07:29,321
And, well, thank you all for coming.

158
00:07:29,487 --> 00:07:32,479
And I'll see you opening night
of <i>Run For Your Wife.</i>

159
00:07:39,607 --> 00:07:41,723
Wow, that was terrific.
Are you always this eloquent?

160
00:07:41,887 --> 00:07:43,639
Oh, well, hardly.

161
00:07:43,807 --> 00:07:46,719
My muse, alas,
is somewhat ephemeral.

162
00:07:46,887 --> 00:07:48,559
Well, it sounds
pretty reliable to me.

163
00:07:48,727 --> 00:07:51,002
- Leslie Wellman. We met earlier.
- Leslie. Of course, yes.

164
00:07:51,167 --> 00:07:54,204
Well, I have to run, but...
I hope I'm not being too forward.

165
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:56,119
I'd love it if you'd give
me a call sometime.

166

I'd be delighted to.

- Here's my card.
- Thank you.

168

Was that Natalie Spencer
I just saw you talking with?

169
00:08:10,327 --> 00:08:11,760
As a matter of fact, it was.

170
00:08:11,927 --> 00:08:14,680
I've been admiring her all evening,
so I steeled myself and asked her

171
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:16,360
- if she might be free next week.
- And?

172
00:08:16,527 --> 00:08:20,998
Well, her lips said, "No."
But her eyes said, "Read my lips."

173
00:08:26,287 --> 00:08:28,005
I suppose you've
come over here to gloat

174
00:08:28,167 --> 00:08:30,158
- because a woman came on to you.
- Oh, no, hardly.

175
00:08:30,327 --> 00:08:31,646
I wouldn't do that sort of thing.

176
00:08:31,807 --> 00:08:34,321
I came over to gloat because
two women came on to me.

177
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:36,796
Two?

178
00:08:36,967 --> 00:08:39,242
My God, I've never had a night
like this in my entire life.

179
00:08:39,407 --> 00:08:42,205
I'm a babe magnet. I'm catnip.

180
00:08:44,047 --> 00:08:45,685
I think I feel a fur ball coming up.

181
00:08:47,487 --> 00:08:49,955
Tell me your second conquest
wasn't that haughty filly

182
00:08:50,127 --> 00:08:52,721
- in the white dress, Kimberly Egan?
- No, no, your path is clear.

183
00:08:52,887 --> 00:08:55,196
Oh, what's the point?

184
00:08:55,367 --> 00:08:57,437
I can't take another rejection.

Well, Niles, tell you what.

186
00:08:59,687 --> 00:09:02,884
Seeing as how Cupid has so amply
stocked my quiver this evening,

187
00:09:03,047 --> 00:09:04,605
I will try a shot on your behalf.

188

Oh, God, you're unbearable.

189

Excuse me.
Kimberly, good evening.

190
00:09:11,327 --> 00:09:13,283
Oh, Frasier,
thank you again for tonight.

191
00:09:13,447 --> 00:09:15,961
- You really are a wonderful host.
- Oh, thank you.

192
00:09:16,127 --> 00:09:17,879
Listen, I don't usually
do this sort of thing,

193
00:09:18,047 --> 00:09:21,562
but there's a gentleman here tonight
who's, well, rather taken with you.

194
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:26,437
He's a... An eligible doctor,
and he's a bit shy about coming over

195
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:28,677
and expressing
those interests to you.

196
00:09:28,847 --> 00:09:31,281
Oh, that is so sweet.

197

Well, you tell your bashful
friend he needn't be so coy.

Well, Doug, it's possible
you're simply going through a dry spell.

00:10:06,527 --> 00:10:08,006
You know, it happens to all of us.

206
00:10:08,167 --> 00:10:10,476
Months go by with nothing.
Then completely out of the blue,

you get not one, but three offers
without doing anything.

Not just for any jobs either,
but desirable ones

with ample salaries
and fabulous perks.

is much like dating.

...most men.

00:10:41,527 --> 00:10:46,396

This is Dr Frasier Crane, KACL 780.

218
00:10:47,687 --> 00:10:50,042
All right, you've compared
dating to unemployment,

Is there anything you'd like to tell me?

220

Ask me if I'm free this weekend.

221
00:10:57,607 --> 00:10:59,916
- Well, obviously...
- Roz, ask me. Come on.

222
00:11:00,087 --> 00:11:03,159
And let me remind you
it is a three-day weekend.

223
00:11:04,607 --> 00:11:07,917
- Are you free this weekend?
- No, I'm not. I have a date.

I have a date tomorrow night.

If I didn't know better,
I'd say someone was jealous.

00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:23,325
After this weekend, you may
have to give up your dating crown.

230
00:11:23,487 --> 00:11:25,523
I once had three dates
on a single Saturday

231
00:11:25,687 --> 00:11:29,396
and still had time to defrost
my refrigerator and rotate my tires.

232
00:11:31,487 --> 00:11:34,001
It's a wonder you could
rotate anything after that.

- All right, good.

- Will you help me with something?
- Sure.

235
00:11:38,847 --> 00:11:40,758

to send a wedding present

236
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:44,363
to someone you haven't seen
or spoken to in 18 years?

237
00:11:44,527 --> 00:11:46,245
It's a bit unusual,
but sweet nonetheless.

238
00:11:46,407 --> 00:11:49,001
Okay. What if the wedding
gift happens to be

239
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:51,965
a sterling-silver picture frame
and inside that,

00:11:52,127 --> 00:11:54,880
there happens to be
a glamour photo of me?

241
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:57,356
Would this have something to
do with an old high school chum

242

during your holiday from hygiene?

to a chic cocktail party.

608
00:30:02,687 --> 00:30:04,678
This is the Roz
I want him to talk about

609
00:30:04,847 --> 00:30:06,917
when he goes to that
wedding this weekend.

610
00:30:07,087 --> 00:30:09,203
The vain, neurotic, lying Roz?

611
00:30:10,407 --> 00:30:12,238
- Oh, are you Roz?
- Yeah.

612
00:30:12,407 --> 00:30:14,477
There was a call for you earlier
from a John Coughlin.

613
00:30:14,647 --> 00:30:17,605
He said he's sorry, but he can't meet
you. He had to take an earlier flight.

614
00:30:17,767 --> 00:30:19,200
Oh, great.

615
00:30:19,367 --> 00:30:20,925
- Roz Doyle, right?
- Yeah.

616
00:30:21,487 --> 00:30:24,684
Sorry. You don't look
anything like he described.

617
00:30:25,687 --> 00:30:28,565
All right, before I do anything
crazy like go to the airport,

618
00:30:28,727 --> 00:30:30,319
fly to Wisconsin
and crash a wedding,

619
00:30:30,487 --> 00:30:32,637
did I really look that bad
the other day?

620
00:30:32,807 --> 00:30:34,843
- Hi, guys.
- Oh, hi, Sherry.

621
00:30:35,007 --> 00:30:36,599
Gee, you look familiar.

622
00:30:36,927 --> 00:30:39,361
Did I meet your older sister
in here the other day?

623
00:30:39,527 --> 00:30:42,041
Oh, she must be jealous of you.

624
00:30:44,567 --> 00:30:46,205
ROZ:
Taxi!

625
00:30:49,167 --> 00:30:52,398
- Mind if I join you?
- Well, of course not.

626
00:30:53,527 --> 00:30:56,564
I was hoping I'd catch you here.

627
00:30:57,527 --> 00:31:00,121
Well, I've been thinking about
what happened yesterday

628
00:31:00,287 --> 00:31:03,279
between your Dad and me,
and I just can't figure it out.

629
00:31:03,447 --> 00:31:07,406
One minute we were having
a stupid argument about chopsticks,

630
00:31:07,567 --> 00:31:10,081
and the next minute
we were broken up.

631
00:31:10,247 --> 00:31:12,807
Well, I hate to put you
on the spot like this,

632
00:31:12,967 --> 00:31:15,117
but did he say anything to you?

633
00:31:15,487 --> 00:31:17,239
FRASIER:
Well, not really.

634
00:31:17,407 --> 00:31:20,240
You know how closed-mouth
Dad is. It's just...

635
00:31:20,407 --> 00:31:23,524
Well, he did say that the break-up
was a long time coming.

636
00:31:24,167 --> 00:31:26,727
Oh, now I really am confused.

637
00:31:26,887 --> 00:31:28,684
I mean, I thought everything
was going fine.

638
00:31:28,847 --> 00:31:30,803
Well, better than fine.

639
00:31:31,767 --> 00:31:33,519
The other night,

640
00:31:33,687 --> 00:31:36,406
we both said,
"I love you," for the first time.

641
00:31:36,567 --> 00:31:39,365
- You did?
- Yes.

642
00:31:39,807 --> 00:31:42,844
Oh, it's just that in the past
he's been rather reserved

643
00:31:43,007 --> 00:31:44,406
about expressing himself that way.

644
00:31:45,207 --> 00:31:48,358
Well, I guess he sort
of hesitated before he said it,

645
00:31:48,527 --> 00:31:52,076
but, I mean, a lot of guys do that when
you spring it on them for the first time.

646
00:31:52,247 --> 00:31:54,602
Yes, well, I can certainly understand
why you're confused.

647
00:31:54,767 --> 00:31:56,086
Well...

648
00:31:56,807 --> 00:31:58,763
If you'd like, I could speak
to him on your behalf.

649
00:31:58,967 --> 00:32:01,435
- Ow.
NILES: I'm sorry. Was that your shin?

650
00:32:01,887 --> 00:32:03,525
SHERRY:
No. No, thanks, Frasier.

651
00:32:03,687 --> 00:32:06,599
I don't wanna put you
in the middle of this.

652
00:32:06,767 --> 00:32:08,962
I'm just frustrated.

653
00:32:09,127 --> 00:32:10,765
Listen. Thanks for listening.

654
00:32:10,927 --> 00:32:12,406
- No problem.
- Anytime.

655
00:32:12,567 --> 00:32:17,277
You know, I really thought
I hit the jackpot with Marty.

656
00:32:17,687 --> 00:32:21,885
It isn't easy finding someone
you think the world of.

657
00:32:22,047 --> 00:32:26,199
Oh, I know, you go tomcatting around
with a different girl every night,

658
00:32:26,367 --> 00:32:28,961
but you can't find
happiness that way.

659
00:32:29,687 --> 00:32:31,359
I haven't so far.

660
00:32:36,967 --> 00:32:38,559
Ow!

661
00:32:39,847 --> 00:32:42,600
- I didn't kick you that hard.
- You didn't have to kick me at all.

662
00:32:42,767 --> 00:32:44,598
Were you seriously
considering playing therapist

663
00:32:44,767 --> 00:32:46,519
to Dad and that woman
after we got rid of her?

664
00:32:46,687 --> 00:32:48,484
I have no intention
of repairing the rift.

665
00:32:48,647 --> 00:32:51,605
God. But last night
for the first time in months,

666
00:32:51,767 --> 00:32:53,325
I wasn't jolted awake at 2 a.m.

667
00:32:53,487 --> 00:32:56,126
By her rousing rendition
of "Foggy Mountain Breakdown."

668
00:32:58,447 --> 00:33:01,041
It seems a little odd
that Dad chose to break up

669
00:33:01,207 --> 00:33:03,323
with Sherry just after
he told her that he loved her.

670
00:33:03,487 --> 00:33:06,445
As I recall, she said
he hesitantly said it back to her.

671
00:33:06,607 --> 00:33:09,041
That's a clear picture of a man
who didn't share her feelings.

672
00:33:09,207 --> 00:33:11,163
Yes, well, I think
he does share her feelings.

673
00:33:11,567 --> 00:33:13,762
- He just panicked out of fear.
- Fear of what?

674
00:33:13,927 --> 00:33:16,566
Well, lots of things.
Change. Commitment.

675
00:33:17,047 --> 00:33:18,958
Becoming vulnerable
to somebody again.

676
00:33:20,647 --> 00:33:22,877
I'm afraid he broke up
with her for all the wrong reasons.

677
00:33:23,047 --> 00:33:26,164
Well, if he'd like a list of the right
reasons, it's available on request.

678
00:33:27,487 --> 00:33:29,125
The least I can do
is have a talk with him.

679
00:33:29,287 --> 00:33:31,039
No, the least
you can do is nothing.

680
00:33:31,207 --> 00:33:34,005
Dad hasn't asked for our help.
We should let nature take its course.

681
00:33:34,167 --> 00:33:37,364
It's like one of those wildlife films
with the lion chasing the antelope.

682
00:33:37,527 --> 00:33:41,122
You don't ask why the photographer
doesn't interfere. You just accept it.

683
00:33:41,967 --> 00:33:43,366
As a general rule, Niles,

684
00:33:43,527 --> 00:33:45,722
the photographer
is not related to the antelope.

685
00:33:46,367 --> 00:33:48,517
Obviously, you and I don't
see eye-to-eye on this issue.

686
00:33:49,247 --> 00:33:51,602
- Where are you going?
- I have a date in 45 minutes,

687
00:33:51,767 --> 00:33:54,486
and a bleeding antelope sitting
in a Barcalounger in my apartment.

688
00:33:57,727 --> 00:34:00,639
I suppose that sounded strange
to you. I'd be happy to explain it.

689
00:34:00,807 --> 00:34:03,196
Are you, by any chance,
free at the end of your shift?

690
00:34:03,367 --> 00:34:05,198
Sorry.

691
00:34:05,367 --> 00:34:07,517

Hello, Dr Crane.

Oh, Dad, listen, I'm glad
you're home. We've gotta talk.

699
00:35:03,087 --> 00:35:04,725
No good conversation
ever started that way.

700

We have to talk
about you and Sherry.

Why? Look, I'm fine with it.

- Come on, now let it go.
- Dad.

703
00:35:10,527 --> 00:35:11,960
Listen, I spoke with Sherry today.

704
00:35:12,127 --> 00:35:13,606
You did what? What for?

705
00:35:13,767 --> 00:35:15,359
Well, she came to see me.

706
00:35:15,527 --> 00:35:18,246
Said she was a bit confused
about what happened the other day.

707
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:20,875
Well, from her story,

708
00:35:21,047 --> 00:35:23,402
I think what you're
contending with here

709
00:35:23,567 --> 00:35:26,798
is a classic case of panic
induced by fear of commitment.

710
00:35:26,967 --> 00:35:29,037
You hear that, Eddie?
That's what buys your dog food.

711
00:35:29,207 --> 00:35:32,677
Well, she told me about a little incident
that took place the other evening

712
00:35:32,847 --> 00:35:34,439
where she expressed
her feelings for you,

713
00:35:34,607 --> 00:35:36,563
- and you hesitantly reciprocated.
- Oh, jeez.

714
00:35:36,727 --> 00:35:38,843
She told you about that?
Look, to cut it short,

715
00:35:39,007 --> 00:35:41,282
she told me how she felt about me.
I said it back,

716
00:35:41,447 --> 00:35:43,802
but I only said it
because I felt I had to.

717
00:35:43,967 --> 00:35:45,798
That's not really what I feel.
So end of story.

than I remember.

758
00:37:26,807 --> 00:37:28,126
Yes, it is.

759
00:37:29,087 --> 00:37:30,839
Excuse me for a minute.
Oh, no, wait.

760
00:37:31,007 --> 00:37:32,759
Here, some wine?

761
00:37:33,687 --> 00:37:36,360
Here we are. To...

762
00:37:37,087 --> 00:37:39,157
...possibilities.

763
00:37:41,567 --> 00:37:43,046
- Oh, Dad.
- Oh, don't worry.

764
00:37:43,207 --> 00:37:45,323
I won't get in the way.
I'm just gonna grab a beer.

765
00:37:45,487 --> 00:37:47,125
Well, it's no trouble at all, Dad.

766
00:37:51,807 --> 00:37:54,640
- Dad, you and Sherry...
- Oh, jeez, I don't believe this.

767
00:37:54,807 --> 00:37:57,958
Frasier, it's over.
She's gone. She's out of my life.

768
00:37:59,447 --> 00:38:01,085
What the hell's she doing here?

769
00:38:01,247 --> 00:38:04,000
Look, she came in to borrow
the powder room. I'll be right back.

770
00:38:04,247 --> 00:38:05,236
How's everything out here?

771
00:38:05,407 --> 00:38:06,999
- Fine.
- How's everything in there?

772
00:38:07,167 --> 00:38:09,806
Fine, fine. I think I just...
I need a few more minutes.

773
00:38:09,967 --> 00:38:11,400
Were you through
with the powder room?

774
00:38:11,567 --> 00:38:13,000
Oh, sure, it's all yours.

775
00:38:13,167 --> 00:38:15,317
Oh, Frasier,
take all the time you need.

776
00:38:15,487 --> 00:38:17,205
- Yes. Thanks.
- I'll entertain your friend.

777
00:38:17,367 --> 00:38:19,517
Oh, what? And miss
this fabulous sunset?

778
00:38:21,367 --> 00:38:23,085
SHERRY:
Oh, yeah. Look at that.

779
00:38:23,247 --> 00:38:25,442
FRASIER: Yes.
- I forgot how beautiful it is.

780
00:38:25,607 --> 00:38:27,120
Yes. So it is. Yeah.

781
00:38:27,287 --> 00:38:28,720
Oh, right. Here.

782
00:38:29,967 --> 00:38:32,322
To poss... Oh, what am I doing?
Here.

783
00:38:33,887 --> 00:38:35,445
All right, just enjoy yourself.

784
00:38:35,607 --> 00:38:37,165
Two minutes. No more.

785
00:38:37,327 --> 00:38:39,716
Oh, not you, Leslie.

786
00:38:41,287 --> 00:38:44,165
I don't know what you think you're
doing, but go back and get rid of her.

787
00:38:44,327 --> 00:38:46,795
- Dad, I am not trying to torture you.
- You're doing a bad job.

788
00:38:46,967 --> 00:38:49,356
All right, listen. I'm a little
bit confused about something.

789
00:38:49,527 --> 00:38:50,880
Maybe you can help
me understand it.

790
00:38:51,047 --> 00:38:53,003
You say you don't have any
feelings for this woman.

791
00:38:53,167 --> 00:38:56,523
Why is it that the last three months
you've been happier than you've been

792
00:38:56,687 --> 00:38:58,837
- since Mom died?
- You leave your mother out of this.

793
00:38:59,487 --> 00:39:02,126
- I didn't mean to bring her into it.
- Well, good.

794
00:39:02,287 --> 00:39:04,517
Dad, is that what
this is about? Mom?

795
00:39:04,687 --> 00:39:06,678
- No. All right?
- Listen, I'm a psychiatrist...

796
00:39:06,847 --> 00:39:09,042
I don't need a psychiatrist,
and I don't need your help.

797
00:39:09,207 --> 00:39:11,721
- That is just classic defensiveness.
- Would you just drop it?

798
00:39:11,887 --> 00:39:13,400
- No, I won't drop it.
- I said drop it!

799
00:39:13,567 --> 00:39:16,035
Listen, Dad, will you...?

800
00:39:16,847 --> 00:39:18,803
Excuse me. Butterfingers.

801
00:39:19,047 --> 00:39:20,685
<i>Momentito.</i>

802
00:39:21,527 --> 00:39:23,006
Now listen, Dad, l...

803
00:39:23,167 --> 00:39:25,397
I do not mean to upset you.

804
00:39:25,567 --> 00:39:27,842
I have a feeling that what
you're going through here is

805
00:39:28,007 --> 00:39:30,760
feelings of guilt.
It's probably natural to feel that way.

806
00:39:30,927 --> 00:39:32,918
My God, I understand
what you're going through.

807
00:39:33,087 --> 00:39:35,965
No, you don't. No, you don't.
You don't understand at all.

808
00:39:37,007 --> 00:39:39,567
When you've been married
for 35 years,

809
00:39:40,047 --> 00:39:42,766
you'd never thought
there'd be anybody else.

810
00:39:43,607 --> 00:39:47,395
Then one day you hear yourself say,
"I love you," to another woman.

811
00:39:48,367 --> 00:39:51,518
Well, maybe then you'll understand
what I'm going through.

812
00:39:55,087 --> 00:39:58,477
Dad, there was a time back when
my first marriage was breaking up.

813
00:39:58,647 --> 00:40:00,046
I was talking to Mom.

814
00:40:00,207 --> 00:40:02,437
She said, "You've gotta promise
you're not gonna give up."

815
00:40:02,607 --> 00:40:04,882
I said, "The last thing I
wanna hear is a bunch of clichës

816
00:40:05,047 --> 00:40:07,436
about how we're all put on this
Earth to love one another,

817
00:40:07,607 --> 00:40:10,599
and how it's certainly possible for the
heart to love more than one person."

818
00:40:11,207 --> 00:40:13,038
I said, "All right, Mom,
give me one good reason

819
00:40:13,207 --> 00:40:15,960
for me to ever let myself
fall in love again."

820
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:18,317
She said, "Because I said so,
and I'm your mother."

821
00:40:23,207 --> 00:40:26,279
Yeah, it sure doesn't help reminding
me what a great lady she was.

822
00:40:26,447 --> 00:40:27,721
Well,

823
00:40:27,887 --> 00:40:30,924
does it help to remind you that
Sherry's a pretty great lady too?

824
00:40:31,967 --> 00:40:34,435
God, Dad, she makes you happy.

825
00:40:35,367 --> 00:40:38,245
Niles and I would give anything
to have what you have.

826
00:40:38,607 --> 00:40:41,405
Well, not what you have
but what you have.

827
00:40:43,967 --> 00:40:46,162
Yeah, she is a pretty great lady,
isn't she?

828
00:40:47,007 --> 00:40:49,999
I don't know.
She'd probably be better off

829
00:40:50,167 --> 00:40:52,727
with some guy who wasn't
going through all this stuff.

830
00:40:52,887 --> 00:40:55,162
Well, don't you think you
ought to let her decide that?

831
00:41:15,607 --> 00:41:16,881
Hi.

832
00:41:17,727 --> 00:41:19,479
Hi.

833
00:41:25,407 --> 00:41:27,637
Well, it looks like those two
could use a little privacy.

834
00:41:27,807 --> 00:41:30,367
Do you mind if I take you
to the restaurant a little early?

835
00:41:30,527 --> 00:41:32,245
- I think that's a good idea.
FRASIER: Okay.

836
00:41:32,407 --> 00:41:35,001
We can finish up with wine later.
I mean... Well, not that I mean

837
00:41:35,167 --> 00:41:36,486
we're gonna be
coming back here.

838
00:41:36,647 --> 00:41:38,285
Not that I'm averse
to that, of course.

839
00:41:38,447 --> 00:41:40,199
I mean, if you're in the mood
for a nightgown.

840
00:41:42,247 --> 00:41:43,965
Nightcap.

841
00:41:44,687 --> 00:41:47,247
It looks like your dad and his
girlfriend are patching things up.

842
00:41:47,407 --> 00:41:48,396
FRASIER:
Yes.

843
00:41:48,767 --> 00:41:51,918
Gee, I can't thank you enough for
being tolerant about the time delay.

844
00:41:52,087 --> 00:41:54,681
LESLIE: Oh, no problem.
- Look, you'd be surprised.

845
00:41:54,847 --> 00:41:58,157
I mean, lately women just fly
into rages of intolerance

846
00:41:58,327 --> 00:42:01,285
just at the slightest provocation.
Well, shall we?

847
00:42:01,447 --> 00:42:03,915
Wait, Leslie, before you go,
I want to say something.

848
00:42:04,087 --> 00:42:06,396
Oh, good Lord. Step lively.

849
00:42:07,047 --> 00:42:11,404
Listen, you are a lucky girl to be
with someone as sweet as Frasier.

850
00:42:11,567 --> 00:42:14,286
He just did a real nice thing
for his dad and me.

851
00:42:14,767 --> 00:42:16,041
Thank you, Sherry.

852
00:42:16,207 --> 00:42:17,720
Off we go.

853
00:42:17,967 --> 00:42:19,241
We'll ride down with you.

854
00:42:19,407 --> 00:42:21,602
We're going down the street
to get a little Chinese.

855
00:42:21,767 --> 00:42:23,405
- Well, why don't we give you a lift?
- No.

856
00:42:23,567 --> 00:42:25,239
Don't you think the walk
would do them good?

857
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:28,444
Oh, no, I think it's starting to rain.
Come on, you'll ride with us.

858
00:42:28,607 --> 00:42:31,041
Oh, you are such a doll.

859
00:42:31,207 --> 00:42:33,926
- So, Leslie, what do you do?
LESLIE: Oh, I'm a dermatologist.

860
00:42:34,087 --> 00:42:36,157
Good news, Frasier.
If you get lucky tonight,

861
00:42:36,327 --> 00:42:39,080
- she might look at that rash of yours.
FRASIER: Yep.

862
00:42:39,607 --> 00:42:41,757
SHERRY:
Oh, that reminds me of a great joke.

863
00:42:41,927 --> 00:42:45,044
No! Just hold the elevator
for me, will you?

864
00:42:45,207 --> 00:42:47,038
Eddie?

865
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:54,204
Well, you could at least
act surprised.
