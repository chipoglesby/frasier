1
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,352
- Niles.
- I'm sorry to drop by unannounced,

2
00:00:15,598 --> 00:00:17,270
- but I need your help.
- Of course. Sherry?

3
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:20,589
Please. As you know, ever since
I moved into The Montana,

4
00:00:20,895 --> 00:00:22,886
I've been angling to meet
our most famous tenant,

5
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:25,343
EsmÃ© Bing, the walnut queen.

6
00:00:25,608 --> 00:00:29,647
Well, I finally cornered her in the
ornamental garden by the wishing well,

7
00:00:29,988 --> 00:00:31,580
and I felt very pleased with myself.

8
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:35,577
That is, until the walnut queen invited
me to a ball. Now I have a problem.

9
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:38,629
Yes, your life has become
an operetta.

10
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:41,901
No, it's a charity ball.

11
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:44,886
And when I say "invited," I mean
she let me buy a table for ten

12
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,286
- at $5000.
- Oh, no.

13
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:50,141
I have until Sunday to sell eight
$500 tickets.

14
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:51,904
- Say no more.
- Oh.

15
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:54,933
- It's a bit steep, but if it's for charity...
- Thanks, Frasier.

16
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:57,735
- It is a very worthy cause.
- All right.

17
00:00:58,016 --> 00:01:02,453
- Well, who should I make this out to?
- To the Esmerelda...

18
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:05,060
...Bing...

19
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:06,987
- ...International...
- Right.

20
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:09,561
...Doll Museum.

21
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:14,380
You do have a problem.

22
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:15,973
I thought you prided yourself

23
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:19,716
- on supporting the arts.
- The arts, Niles. Not the crafts.

24
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:22,598
I told you, I can't do it now.
Sherry's taking me out

25
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:26,184
for our third-month anniversary,
and I gotta get a new sport coat.

26
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:29,256
You cannot skip your exercises again.
You skipped them yesterday.

27
00:01:29,547 --> 00:01:31,617
This is the only time Sherry
can go shopping with me.

28
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:34,955
And I can't go without her. There isn't
a woman alive with her fashion sense.

29
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:38,378
Carmen Miranda having passed on.

30
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:40,195
I should think having a lady friend

31
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:42,663
would make you exercise more,
not less.

32
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:45,450
I don't mean to be indelicate,
but a man in your condition

33
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:48,290
who wants to enjoy certain,
shall we say, indoor sports

34
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:51,478
should take steps to
make sure that cranky old Mr. Hip

35
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:55,214
doesn't, shall we say, let down
the team, if you get my meaning.

36
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:56,726
Oh, don't you worry about me.

37
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,668
I may not be rookie of the year
anymore,

38
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,787
but I can still move around the bases.

39
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:04,074
- Oh, hey, Martin.
- Oh, look, a scout from the majors.

40
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,247
- See you later. Gotta run.
- Okay, bye.

41
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:09,732
- Well, Roz, this is a surprise.
- Big news.

42
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:13,482
- Gertie Olsen's leaving the station.
- What, from <i>Gertie's Grab Bag</i>?

43
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,518
- I love that show.
- Oh, please.

44
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,318
That homily-spouting hausfrau

45
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:19,351
is the most embarrassing thing
on the air.

46
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:23,795
- So she finally got canned, eh?
- No, she got a million-dollar TV deal.

47
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:30,689
Good news for Gertie,
and for the many atheists

48
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:33,339
who will welcome this new proof
of their theory.

49
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:39,368
Well, anyway, they're auditioning
people for her time slot, and...

50
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:41,103
I'm gonna go for it.

51
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:43,648
What do you mean, your own show?

52
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:45,946
Oh, Roz, that's exciting.

53
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:49,165
And what better way to celebrate
an exciting new career move,

54
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:52,214
than spending this Sunday
at a swanky society ball.

55
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:53,699
Oh, drop it, Niles!

56
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:57,817
Roz, I must say,
this comes as bit of a surprise.

57
00:02:58,094 --> 00:03:00,369
I never knew
you wanted your own show.

58
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:02,594
Well, it's the whole reason
I got into radio.

59
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:05,647
I had my own show in college, and
when I started working at the station,

60
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:07,926
I just sort of got stuck
on the producing side.

61
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,418
Well, what kind of show
did you have in mind?

62
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:14,899
I thought I'd talk about stuff I know.
You know, the singles' life in Seattle.

63
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:17,989
Dating, fashion,
where to meet available men.

64
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:20,954
If you're looking for an event
that'll be crawling with single men,

65
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:23,710
- this particular gala should be just--
- Niles!

66
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:28,432
Anyway, Frasier, I hope
you'll support me on this.

67
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:32,830
Well... I hate to lose you,
but of course I'll support you.

68
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:35,639
Thank you, Frasier. You're the best.

69
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:37,277
- Well...
- Well, listen,

70
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:40,342
as long as I've got you all here,
I'm putting together a tape,

71
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:42,832
and I could use people
to pretend to be callers.

72
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:44,850
- We'd be glad.
- Sounds like fun.

73
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,136
- I'll come back tonight.
- All right.

74
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:49,749
And, Daphne, I need
at least one spicy call.

75
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:53,730
Could you pretend to be a woman
who doesn't believe in sex without love,

76
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:57,457
but just feels so horny sometimes
she wants to jump anything in pants?

77
00:03:57,779 --> 00:04:00,247
Well, I'll try.

78
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:03,888
And while I'm at it, I'll see if
I can fake a British accent.

79
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:14,868
Good afternoon, Seattle. I'm
Roz Doyle, and this is <i>Love Matters</i>.

80
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:19,687
Today we're chatting with merchant
seaman Steve Baron from Bellingham.

81
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,638
Tell me, Steve, what do you look
for in an ideal date?

82
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:29,721
When my shipmates and I put into port
after several weeks at sea--

83
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,502
Cut.

84
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:35,787
I'm sorry, Frasier, but you don't
sound like a merchant seaman.

85
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:38,581
Point well taken.
Let's try again. All right.

86
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:41,854
So, Steve, what do you look
for in an ideal date?

87
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:44,724
When my shipmates and I...

88
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:52,422
...put into port after several weeks
at sea, the first thing we do is--

89
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:55,784
Head for the antique sales.

90
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,776
Fine, smarty pants.
You play Steve then.

91
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:02,724
No. Never mind. Let's just go on
to my next idea. Daphne?

92
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:05,408
Okay, you be the girlfriend
in a couple

93
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,557
who wants to spice things up
in the bedroom.

94
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:10,162
- Niles, will you be her boyfriend?
- Yes.

95
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,541
Okay. I'm here with Fred and Patty.

96
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,728
Tell me, you two,
what made you think

97
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,942
that your sex life needed
a little jump-start?

98
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:26,057
It's all his fault.

99
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,715
He just seems
to have lost interest in me.

100
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:32,465
I've done everything I can
to entice him. I've...

101
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:36,261
I've served dinner wearing nothing
but high heels and an apron.

102
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:41,232
I've called him at the office
and talked dirty.

103
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:45,629
And last night when he came home,
I was lying in bed

104
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:48,727
wearing a whipped-cream teddy.

105
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:52,731
But did he care? No!

106
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,975
And none of this turned you on, Fred?

107
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,588
Fred?

108
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,997
That's nothing. You should hear
the other things that didn't turn me on.

109
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:11,276
Tell me about them, Patty.

110
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,355
Let's cut to the chase.

111
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:15,977
Patty, men are like fish.

112
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:18,852
When you first hook them,
they wriggle around like crazy.

113
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:23,042
But once you finally reel them in,
they just lie there with that glassy look.

114
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:26,564
- I'd throw this one back.
- That's terrible advice.

115
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:27,960
- No, it isn't.
- Yes, it is.

116
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:30,488
You have no idea how Fred
really feels about Daphne-- Patsy.

117
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:32,960
- Patty.
- Patty.

118
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:36,287
- This is pointless.
- No, Roz, you were doing just fine.

119
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:41,353
No, I was terrible. I wasn't helpful.
I wasn't smart. I wasn't even sassy.

120
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:44,408
Well, well, perhaps not sassy,
but you were certainly saucy.

121
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:47,335
That borders on sassy. Roz!

122
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:51,806
Hello, Mr. Crane. How was
your romantic evening with Sherry?

123
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:55,627
Oh, it was fine. Fine. Yeah. Yeah.

124
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,885
Hey, Daph, how about getting
that exercise mat out?

125
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:01,444
We'll do some stretches, huh? Ah.

126
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:04,522
Can't right now. I'm helping Roz
with her audition tape.

127
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,869
Well, how long's it gonna take?

128
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:09,490
What are you so eager for?

129
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:11,993
Oh, I get the picture.

130
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:15,546
Not too limber with Sherry
this evening, were we?

131
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:18,685
Two hips but no hooray?

132
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,112
Very funny. Well, you haven't exactly
been burning it up

133
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,753
in the romance department either.

134
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:25,896
What do you know about my love life?

135
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:27,872
<i>I was lying in bed</i>

136
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,264
<i>wearing a whipped-cream teddy.</i>

137
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:32,649
<i>But did he care?</i>

138
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:38,014
It takes a little time
to get the hang of it at first.

139
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,043
My God, you should've heard
my audition tape.

140
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,761
- I was so inept it was incredible.
- That's true.

141
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:45,116
Well... Oh, you mean--
Well, you heard it.

142
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:47,134
All right, then you see
what perseverance--

143
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:49,852
There was a bootleg copy floating
around the station for months.

144
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,854
Yes, well, fine.
So you get my point then.

145
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:55,009
- Yeah, people still play it at parties.
- Well, all right, Roz!

146
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:58,247
Hey, Roz, I hear you're
trying out for a new job.

147
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,308
Yes, as a matter of fact, I am. And you
could really help me with my demo.

148
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:04,640
- What do I do?
- I just want an honest answer.

149
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,971
- I want to talk to you about first dates.
- Okay.

150
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:10,354
Are you sure Dad's the best candidate
for this particular subject?

151
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:14,650
Quick survey. How many Crane men
here with a girlfriend?

152
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:18,893
No, no. Keep them up while I count.

153
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,609
All right, here.

154
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:22,426
- Sure, I'll help you.
- Great.

155
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:26,025
- Okay, Frasier...
- Just a minute. Here we are.

156
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,978
- Start the tape.
- Yes.

157
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:32,057
We're here with Martin,
and we're talking about first dates.

158
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:35,894
Martin, tell me some of the tricks
you use to impress women.

159
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:40,817
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, Roz,
but I really don't know any tricks.

160
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:44,543
I mean, if a woman agrees
to go out with me, I'd...

161
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:47,611
Well, I'm not there to impress her
or to play cool.

162
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:51,212
I'm there because I want to know her.
You know, what she thinks,

163
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:55,683
what she likes. So that if I'm lucky
enough to get another date,

164
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:58,266
I can plan something
that I know she'd like to do.

165
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:01,788
I guess I'm still old-fashioned
or something,

166
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,643
but I think you should treat
a woman like a queen.

167
00:09:09,341 --> 00:09:12,731
Bow to the master, boys.
Bow to the master.

168
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:17,129
- Hey, Bebe!
- Bulldog Briscoe,

169
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,460
my absolute favorite client!

170
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:21,557
Hello, Bebe.

171
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:25,884
And Frasier Crane!
Alert the judges, we have a tie!

172
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:30,514
Hello. Oh, my goodness, what a flock.
These all yours?

173
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,050
Yes. The minute I heard
about the auditions,

174
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:36,315
I piled all my hottest new discoveries
into the van.

175
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:38,616
- You brought them in a van?
- I call it

176
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:41,338
my Bebe's Stars of Tomorrow Tour.

177
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:44,633
People, I want you to meet
Frasier Crane.

178
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:46,510
- Hello.
- The caringest client

179
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:48,027
- an agent ever had.
- Well...

180
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:52,327
Frasier, this is Professor Pete,
the human encyclopedia.

181
00:09:52,676 --> 00:09:55,474
Ask him anything.
He can't be stumped.

182
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:59,960
Well, all right. Explain Freud's
theory of the superego.

183
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:05,223
Sigmund Freud, noted psychiatrist,
was born in Vienna.

184
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:09,833
- But that's not what I asked.
- He believed dreams

185
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,544
had secret meanings.

186
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:15,099
He just pulls it out of the air.

187
00:10:16,408 --> 00:10:18,797
But if it's a raucous political debate
you want,

188
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:21,545
meet newlyweds
Hank and Hannah Finch.

189
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:24,219
- Hello, Hank.
- He's a right-wing Baptist preacher,

190
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:27,616
she's a fun-loving bisexual.

191
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,467
Conflicts? You bet!

192
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:35,340
- Have you ever seen such talent?
- Well...

193
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:37,554
God, they're pathetic.

194
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:39,715
- Frasier, Frasier!
- Roz.

195
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:43,170
- It went really well.
- Oh, God, I'm so happy for you.

196
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,671
Do you know what he actually said?
At this moment,

197
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:48,246
- I am the candidate to beat!
- Congratulations, Roz.

198
00:10:48,523 --> 00:10:49,876
- That's fabulous.
- Okay.

199
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:51,985
- I'm gonna get set up for the show.
- Okay.

200
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:54,590
- I'm so excited.
- Okay.

201
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:57,013
Well, rah-rah for little Roz!

202
00:10:57,282 --> 00:10:59,876
Yes, well, I'm really thrilled
for her. I am.

203
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:03,724
But God knows where I'm gonna find
another producer I feel so in sync with.

204
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:06,872
You know, Hank Finch produced
hygiene films in the Army.

205
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:10,045
No, no. Bebe, I don't think so.

206
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:14,007
Oh, I'm not proud to admit this,
but there is a small part of me

207
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:16,051
that hopes she doesn't get the job.

208
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:17,814
God, I feel guilty just saying that.

209
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:21,682
You're so good.
Everything makes you feel guilty.

210
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:23,971
I'm so proud to represent you.

211
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:27,183
You're like a modern-day
what's-his-name.

212
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:30,516
Pete! Famous German doctor,
built a hospital in Africa.

213
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:33,170
- Albert something?
- Hang on.

214
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:36,674
- Schweitzer.
- No...

215
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,008
And that's it for our show today.

216
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:44,962
But before I sign off,
this final note to Karla,

217
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:48,841
who called us early
from the planet Fripton.

218
00:11:50,794 --> 00:11:53,513
The technical term for your condition,
which eluded me earlier,

219
00:11:53,797 --> 00:11:57,187
is schizophreniform disorder.

220
00:11:57,509 --> 00:11:59,545
Or in layman's terms:

221
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:05,020
God, you know once in a while,
it's nice to just call them as I see them.

222
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,705
Hey, what's going on out here?

223
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:10,207
Oh, good Lord,
is it someone's birthday?

224
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,277
I hate to be the one
to break it to you,

225
00:12:12,524 --> 00:12:14,480
but Brenda from the newsroom
got the job.

226
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,770
- Brenda?
- Oh, Roz.

227
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:19,826
It's total BS. Listen, if you
need a little comforting later--

228
00:12:20,115 --> 00:12:23,027
Hey, Brenda, all right! Wait up!
I'm there for you.

229
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,999
- Roz, I'm so sorry.
- Oh, hell. I'll be okay.

230
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:32,305
Guess I'd better go congratulate
the winner.

231
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,143
Right.

232
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:37,878
Bebe, did you hear
what happened to Roz?

233
00:12:38,133 --> 00:12:41,409
- Yes. No need to thank me, darling.
- What? What are you talking about?

234
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,948
I spoke to the station manager.

235
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:45,249
I told him just how you'd feel
if he gave Roz the job.

236
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:47,983
You did what? Get in here!

237
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:51,101
I said that Frasier Crane
wasn't about to work for a station

238
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:53,432
- that would steal his producer away.
- Oh.

239
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:56,523
A bluff, of course, but he crumbled
like a matzo.

240
00:12:56,818 --> 00:12:58,490
God, how could you?

241
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:01,425
When I told you I'd hate to
lose Roz, I didn't mean for you

242
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:05,407
- to sabotage her.
- You didn't?

243
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:07,905
Oh, no.

244
00:13:08,163 --> 00:13:11,599
What a horrible
misunderstanding. Wink!

245
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,351
I mean it.

246
00:13:15,587 --> 00:13:17,817
Oh, I see.

247
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:20,922
So when you said in that
off-handed way that you hoped

248
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:26,814
that Roz wouldn't get the job,
I totally misinterpreted you.

249
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:30,420
- Wink!
- Will you stop winking!

250
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:34,792
My God, I could never want
such a thing!

251
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:37,779
God, maybe there's some way
I can still reverse this.

252
00:13:38,068 --> 00:13:40,787
Oh, that was fun. I got to watch
Brenda sign her new contract.

253
00:13:41,071 --> 00:13:43,266
Roz, I think what they did to you
is monstrous.

254
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,935
I wish I could stay here
and console you,

255
00:13:46,201 --> 00:13:48,840
but my people are waiting
for me in the van.

256
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:52,575
I hope someone cracked
a window.

257
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,764
Listen, Roz, there's something
we need to talk about.

258
00:13:57,045 --> 00:13:59,036
Oh, Frasier, I know
what you're gonna say.

259
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:01,936
That I tried my best.
That I deserved it.

260
00:14:02,217 --> 00:14:03,935
I'm fine with this, really.

261
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:07,859
Yeah, I gave it a shot.
That's what counts.

262
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:09,330
I didn't get it.

263
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:11,396
It's not like my life is over.

264
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:14,328
Oh. Oh, no. Oh.

265
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:19,909
Oh, look at me. I'm so busy
feeling sorry for myself

266
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:22,066
I haven't even thanked you
for all your help.

267
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,959
- That's not necessary.
- No, it is.

268
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,832
Look how close you helped me get.

269
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:29,430
It's because of you
that I was second choice.

270
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:31,819
I can't argue with that.

271
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,399
Come for a second.

272
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:36,057
Listen, there's something
I need to confess to you.

273
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:39,610
You know, as much as I hoped
that you'd get the job,

274
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:45,279
there was a very small part of me,
a very selfish part, that...

275
00:14:45,677 --> 00:14:47,190
That hoped you wouldn't.

276
00:14:47,429 --> 00:14:50,944
Oh, that's not bad.
That's really kind of sweet.

277
00:14:51,516 --> 00:14:53,347
Well, I'm glad to hear you feel
that way because

278
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,353
I happened to mention
those feelings to Bebe.

279
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:59,357
- Bebe? You told Bebe?
- It was just in passing.

280
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:01,682
Oh, great. She torpedoed me,
didn't she?

281
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:03,979
Yes. She told Doug that I'd quit
if you got the job.

282
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:06,353
- I don't believe this.
- I'm glad to see you're as mad

283
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:07,933
- at her as I am!
- I'm mad at you!

284
00:15:08,158 --> 00:15:09,227
- Me?
- How could do that?

285
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:12,011
It was just an off-hand remark.
How was I to know how she'd react?

286
00:15:12,287 --> 00:15:13,561
She's Bebe!

287
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:16,924
If you had said
you liked my eyes,

288
00:15:17,167 --> 00:15:20,000
they would've been on your desk
tomorrow in a Tiffany box.

289
00:15:20,295 --> 00:15:22,013
Oh, God! Roz, I'm so sorry.

290
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:24,610
Just tell me how I can make it up
to you. I promise I will.

291
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:27,568
- You mean it?
- Yes. Anything. Just name it.

292
00:15:28,053 --> 00:15:30,487
- Fire Bebe.
- Will that--?

293
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:33,517
Well-- How many things--?

294
00:15:33,808 --> 00:15:35,639
Isn't there something else
you'd like?

295
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:40,459
The only thing I wanted was that job.
And she took it away.

296
00:15:41,483 --> 00:15:43,758
I am not just suggesting
this for my sake.

297
00:15:44,027 --> 00:15:47,417
I'm suggesting it for yours.
She is your representative.

298
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:51,049
When she goes out into the world
lying and twisting your words

299
00:15:51,368 --> 00:15:55,202
and stabbing people in the back,
it reflects badly on you.

300
00:15:57,415 --> 00:15:59,167
You're right, Roz.

301
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,097
How can I consider myself
an ethical person

302
00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:04,965
when I have the princess of darkness
conducting my business for me?

303
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:08,449
Well, that's it. I'm gonna have to fire
that conniving harpy.

304
00:16:08,843 --> 00:16:10,435
I'm very proud of you.

305
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:12,874
I'm ashamed to think how long
I've turned a blind eye

306
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:14,572
on her unscrupulous behavior.

307
00:16:15,225 --> 00:16:17,181
And what for?

308
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:21,223
Twenty-percent pay increase?
Six-week paid vacation.

309
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:23,043
An expense account.
A travel allowance.

310
00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:26,550
- Frasier!
- Well, not anymore.

311
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:35,208
Frasier Crane's here.
He's not alone. Have a seat.

312
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:40,504
Frasier, Roz. My two favorite people.

313
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:42,066
- Not for long.
- Bebe,

314
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:44,204
we've got to discuss what
happened this morning.

315
00:16:44,462 --> 00:16:46,612
This time you won't wink
your way out of it.

316
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:51,636
This sounds serious. You two come
right in, and we'll solve this thing.

317
00:16:52,012 --> 00:16:55,527
Let's just promise to be totally honest
with each other.

318
00:16:55,849 --> 00:16:58,602
We're losing one. Code red.

319
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,272
What can I get you?
Champagne?

320
00:17:02,564 --> 00:17:04,077
- Nothing.
- A massage?

321
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:06,590
- No, thank you.
- You're sure?

322
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,532
Vladimir can be here
in five minutes.

323
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:10,416
He will play your spine
like a Steinway.

324
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,452
Can we just get started?

325
00:17:13,408 --> 00:17:18,357
Roz, I'm just a wreck
about our misunderstanding today.

326
00:17:18,747 --> 00:17:21,181
- Can you ever forgive me?
- No.

327
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:24,450
Why should you?
I don't forgive myself.

328
00:17:24,753 --> 00:17:29,144
Bebe, what you did today was unfair,
not just to Roz, but to me.

329
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:32,988
Thanks to you, a strain
has been put on our relationship,

330
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:36,378
both professionally and personally.

331
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:40,276
Now all of this I might be able to let go
had it been an isolated incident,

332
00:17:40,602 --> 00:17:44,038
but I've observed that it's just part
of a pattern-- Are you quite all right?

333
00:17:44,856 --> 00:17:48,246
It's nothing. It's just
a silly little cardiac thing.

334
00:17:48,902 --> 00:17:51,860
Go, go! You're distracting my client,
and my clients come first.

335
00:17:52,155 --> 00:17:56,148
Oh, poor little Bebe. How many fake
pills do you have to take every day?

336
00:17:56,493 --> 00:17:58,802
Yes, did you really think you
could deceive us sitting there

337
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:00,194
popping a bunch of--

338
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:03,405
Digitalis? Oh, my God!
You really are sick!

339
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,460
Well, of course I'm sick.

340
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:09,066
But it makes me even sicker
to think that I've angered you

341
00:18:09,381 --> 00:18:12,373
when all I wanted to do was keep
the best damn team in radio together.

342
00:18:12,676 --> 00:18:15,144
Oh, God. We're gonna need
a shovel to get out of here.

343
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:17,578
Yes, all right, Bebe.
Be that as it may, I still--

344
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:22,052
I told you, no calls.

345
00:18:23,228 --> 00:18:25,184
What about my sister?

346
00:18:27,482 --> 00:18:29,313
One second.

347
00:18:30,193 --> 00:18:32,946
Did the air bag deploy?

348
00:18:35,573 --> 00:18:38,007
Look, I'm gonna have
to call you back.

349
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:42,436
Frasier's here,
and my clients come first.

350
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:47,100
I'm sorry. You were saying?

351
00:18:47,752 --> 00:18:50,630
Since the moment we met,
you have shown yourself to be

352
00:18:50,922 --> 00:18:52,913
ruthless and untrustworthy.

353
00:18:53,174 --> 00:18:56,211
As these are qualities I do not wish
to have associated with my name,

354
00:18:56,511 --> 00:18:57,660
It's best that we part--

355
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:03,579
- What did I say about calls?
- <i>Auntie Bebe?</i>

356
00:19:04,102 --> 00:19:07,060
Oh, Suzy.

357
00:19:08,523 --> 00:19:11,037
Sorry to hear about
your mummy's accident.

358
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:13,831
<i>I'm frightened, Auntie Bebe.</i>

359
00:19:14,529 --> 00:19:16,485
Don't be, little one.

360
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:22,019
<i>If Mummy goes to heaven,</i>
<i>will you take care of me?</i>

361
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:31,312
Of course, my little lamb.
Assuming that I have the resources.

362
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,268
Bebe, you know,
I can't help noticing

363
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:36,418
that none of your outside lines
are lit up.

364
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:39,907
The bulbs are broken.

365
00:19:43,641 --> 00:19:44,960
Auntie has to go.

366
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:48,336
I'm with a client, and you know
what we say about clients.

367
00:19:48,646 --> 00:19:52,002
They always come first.

368
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:56,602
- You are amazing.
- Is there nothing you won't stoop to?

369
00:19:57,405 --> 00:20:01,398
I had no idea who I was speaking to!

370
00:20:01,743 --> 00:20:03,859
How dare you impersonate my niece!

371
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,669
I've had enough of your cruel jokes!
You're fired, Mother!

372
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:12,473
- I just wanna say--
- No! Stop!

373
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:15,021
Not one more crooked word!

374
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:18,495
Your tongue could open a wine bottle!

375
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:23,526
As of now, Frasier Crane
has resigned from your coven.

376
00:20:23,807 --> 00:20:27,163
Oh, that's it, is it?
I'm not virtuous enough for you?

377
00:20:27,477 --> 00:20:32,790
Not noble? Fine, quit! Next time you
need a deal made, call the Dalai Lama!

378
00:20:34,693 --> 00:20:38,527
A long time ago I had to make a choice
between being a good agent

379
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:42,378
and a good person, because,
trust me, you can't be both!

380
00:20:42,701 --> 00:20:46,057
So forgive me if I don't have time to
make everybody feel warm and fuzzy.

381
00:20:46,371 --> 00:20:49,602
I am just too busy spending every
waking minute pulling any string,

382
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:53,909
playing any shameless trick I can
to make my clients' dreams come true.

383
00:20:54,254 --> 00:20:57,052
I am a star maker!

384
00:20:57,674 --> 00:21:00,507
And if you can't appreciate that,
there are plenty who can.

385
00:21:01,094 --> 00:21:02,368
How about you?
You want an agent?

386
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:04,233
- Oh, please!
- You mean it?

387
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:06,349
Roz!

388
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:10,368
I never had an agent.
It's not like she worships the devil.

389
00:21:10,645 --> 00:21:13,398
Well, she doesn't have to.
He worships her!

390
00:21:16,526 --> 00:21:19,598
You're absolutely right, Frasier.
Forget it, Bebe. No way.

391
00:21:19,904 --> 00:21:21,735
That voice. I could listen to it all day.

392
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:25,027
It's pure, yet smoldering
like a nun with a past.

393
00:21:25,327 --> 00:21:27,477
- You think so?
- No, Roz, don't look her in the eye.

394
00:21:27,746 --> 00:21:30,579
I could triple your salary.
Voiceovers, commercials...

395
00:21:30,874 --> 00:21:32,705
Roz, listen to me. For God's sake,

396
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:35,234
if you've got the tiniest shred
of sense or dignity left,

397
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:38,256
remember what this woman did to you
this afternoon. And renounce her.

398
00:21:38,548 --> 00:21:42,461
She has no scruples. No ethics.
And no reflection!

399
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:47,310
Let's get out of here.

400
00:21:47,557 --> 00:21:51,596
Well, nice doing business with you.
Wink!

401
00:21:53,563 --> 00:21:55,838
Oh, damn it. Frasier, I forgot my purse.

402
00:21:56,107 --> 00:21:57,984
- All right.
- Just be a minute.

403
00:21:58,485 --> 00:22:00,680
- Lunch tomorrow?
- 12:30. Bernardi's.

404
00:22:00,945 --> 00:22:02,697
Gotcha.
