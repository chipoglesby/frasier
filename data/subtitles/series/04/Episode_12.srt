Let me have a tall skinny to go,
please, and you can keep the change.

2
00:00:12,594 --> 00:00:15,711
Now, I've only got a moment.
I've taken on a very exciting project.

3
00:00:15,874 --> 00:00:17,387
- Oh, really.
FRASIER: Yes. You know,

4
00:00:17,554 --> 00:00:19,829
this is KACL's 50th anniversary.
I did a little research,

5
00:00:19,994 --> 00:00:23,304
found out that they used to
specialize in live radio dramas.

6
00:00:23,474 --> 00:00:24,463
So I'm putting one on.

7
00:00:24,634 --> 00:00:26,750
- Surely you must remember them.
- Oh, sure.

8
00:00:26,914 --> 00:00:29,348
Yes, people of Dad's generation
would sit around at night,

9
00:00:29,514 --> 00:00:31,584
listening to the radio,
absolutely mesmerized.

10
00:00:31,754 --> 00:00:33,551
We were a simple people.

11
00:00:33,874 --> 00:00:35,102
FRASIER:
All right, Dad.

12
00:00:35,274 --> 00:00:37,742
I spoke with the station manager.
He's given me 30 minutes

13
00:00:37,914 --> 00:00:41,270
to re-create the very first mystery
KACL ever aired.

14
00:00:41,674 --> 00:00:45,030
- "Nightmare Inn."
- Oh, don't tell me, I know.

15
00:00:45,194 --> 00:00:47,662
Bunch of people get caught in a storm,
and everybody's wondering

16
00:00:47,834 --> 00:00:49,313
who's gonna be
the first one murdered.

17
00:00:49,474 --> 00:00:53,513
- Exactly! And I'm going to direct.
- Oh, so we can stop wondering.

18
00:00:55,354 --> 00:00:57,151
You don't think he
knows how to direct?

19
00:00:57,314 --> 00:00:59,874
No, the trouble is he doesn't know
how to stop directing.

20
00:01:00,034 --> 00:01:01,752
In our prep school production
of <i>Richard III,</i>

21
00:01:01,914 --> 00:01:04,906
he drove the entire cast crazy
with his constant critiquing.

22
00:01:05,074 --> 00:01:08,225
I seem to recall a delay on opening
night while our Richard chased Frasier

23
00:01:08,394 --> 00:01:10,749
around the dressing room,
beating him with his hump.

24
00:01:11,394 --> 00:01:14,272
Niles, it was just a little backstage
horseplay to relieve tension.

25
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:16,305
- Thank you.
- You have an Orson Welles complex.

26
00:01:16,474 --> 00:01:17,702
In the end,
you'll be directing,

27
00:01:17,874 --> 00:01:20,229
you'll have rewritten the script
and be playing the lead.

28
00:01:20,394 --> 00:01:22,191
I have no intention of
performing in it myself.

29
00:01:22,354 --> 00:01:25,630
The only rewriting I've done is simply
cutting, to get it down to 30 minutes.

30
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:30,390
- "Frasier Crane's Nightmare Inn"?
- It's just a working title.

31

Well, that's our show for today,
but let me remind you to tune in

32
00:01:36,794 --> 00:01:42,630
on Saturday night for KACL's
presentation of "Nightmare Inn."

33
00:01:42,794 --> 00:01:45,228
Just set your dials for goose bumps.

34
00:01:45,754 --> 00:01:48,314
Till then, this is Dr Frasier Crane
reminding you that

35
00:01:48,754 --> 00:01:53,703

what's lurking in the shadows.

- No.

- Oh, don't be silly, Roz.

- but believe me, my hands are full.
- Oh, Frasier,

43
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:19,631
I've had a quick peek at your script,
and I think I'd be perfect

44
00:02:19,794 --> 00:02:23,264
as "Bull" Kragen,
the brutish gamekeeper.

45
00:02:24,234 --> 00:02:27,863
You know, Gil, I think that's just a bit
too on the nose.

46
00:02:28,034 --> 00:02:30,502
- Well, maybe.
- But you know what you could play?

47
00:02:30,674 --> 00:02:32,107
Yes. Nigel Fairservice.

Drummed out of the Royal Air Force
under mysterious circumstances.

49
00:02:37,154 --> 00:02:40,305
With him playing it, they may not seem
so mysterious.

50
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,029
I'll take it.

51
00:02:42,194 --> 00:02:45,345
After all, Nigel does have that
divine speech in the second act

52
00:02:45,514 --> 00:02:49,029
about his boyhood in Surrey:
"Romping with his school chums

53
00:02:49,194 --> 00:02:52,072
in the fens and spinneys,
when the twilight bathed

00:02:52,234 --> 00:02:55,032
the hedgerows like a lambent flame."

55
00:02:56,074 --> 00:02:58,952
Actually, I had rather a long
peek at the script.

56
00:03:00,794 --> 00:03:03,149
Gosh, we still have a lot of these
supporting roles to cast.

57

Actually, I'm working on that.

or seven smaller parts.

- Actually, I wasn't talking about me.

00:03:18,354 --> 00:03:20,424
I was talking about a friend of mine,
Maxine.

- Does she have experience?
BULLDOG: Are you kidding?

she spent on stage...

Oh, wait a minute. She does.

67
00:03:29,074 --> 00:03:31,952
Well, we do still have the part
of the maid. She only has one line.

- Does it have any big words?
- No, it's simple.

"Look out! He's got a gun."

70

Maxine could knock that line
right out of the park.

Well, okay, but you have to agree
to play a part too.

is gonna be so excited.

- Maybe here she doesn't.

Several people.

You know, that's wonderful, Mel...

155
00:07:49,154 --> 00:07:52,703
...but he sounds to me just a bit more
Austrian than German.

156
00:07:52,874 --> 00:07:56,833
I've done that accent both on
Broadway and the London stage.
