00:00:10,167 --> 00:00:12,727
[SHOWER RUNNING]

2
00:00:34,447 --> 00:00:36,244
Whoa.

3
00:00:59,287 --> 00:01:01,118
Well, look who's up.

4
00:01:08,687 --> 00:01:12,316
BO Y: <i>It's my parents. I don't know,</i>
<i>they're just, like, really stupid.</i>

5
00:01:12,487 --> 00:01:14,762
- May I ask how old you are?
- <i>Fourteen.</i>

6
00:01:15,207 --> 00:01:17,277
Well, hang on, Jimmy.
Your parents are gonna be stupid

7
00:01:17,447 --> 00:01:19,244
for another seven years.

8
00:01:20,287 --> 00:01:22,118
<i>Whoa, seven years?</i>

9
00:01:22,327 --> 00:01:24,443
<i>That's, like, longer than</i>
<i>I'll be in high school.</i>

10
00:01:24,647 --> 00:01:27,036
I salute your optimism.

11
00:01:27,527 --> 00:01:29,006
We'll be right back after this.

12
00:01:30,367 --> 00:01:33,723
Oh, God, Roz. A teenager
who's embarrassed by his parents?

13
00:01:33,887 --> 00:01:36,640
Can't you come up with something
a little more challenging for me?

14
00:01:36,807 --> 00:01:39,275
It was either him or our
old pal Rudy, the crier.

15
00:01:39,447 --> 00:01:42,086
Rudy, the crier. He's been on
three times in the last month.

16
00:01:42,247 --> 00:01:45,239
You put him on again, he won't
be the only one who's crying.

17
00:01:45,487 --> 00:01:48,001
God, I'm in a dry spell.

18
00:01:48,167 --> 00:01:50,362
Where are the souls
of genuine torment?

19
00:01:50,567 --> 00:01:53,604
The people teetering on the brink
of genuine despair?

20
00:01:53,807 --> 00:01:57,277
Oh, they'll be back. The holidays
are just around the corner.

21
00:01:57,487 --> 00:01:58,886
Well, perhaps you're right.

22
00:01:59,047 --> 00:02:00,321
Oh, Roz.

23
00:02:00,487 --> 00:02:02,796
- I've a question I'd like to ask you.
- Shoot.

24
00:02:02,967 --> 00:02:07,006
Have you ever had a recurring dream
of an intimate nature about someone...

25
00:02:07,167 --> 00:02:09,442
Well, a coworker?

26
00:02:09,647 --> 00:02:11,922
- Oh, no, why'd you tell me?
- Oh, Roz.

27
00:02:12,087 --> 00:02:14,999
Now it's gonna be creepy every time
you look at me through the glass.

28
00:02:15,207 --> 00:02:16,640
Roz, not you!

29
00:02:17,087 --> 00:02:19,203
- Who was it then?
- I'm not gonna go into specifics.

30
00:02:19,367 --> 00:02:21,244
- Gina in accounting?
- I'm not gonna do this.

31
00:02:21,647 --> 00:02:24,525
- Oh, Sheila, the slow intern?
- Forget I even mentioned it.

32
00:02:25,167 --> 00:02:26,839
Knock, knock.

33
00:02:27,607 --> 00:02:29,086
Gil.

34
00:02:29,247 --> 00:02:31,317
Frasier, I've come to tempt you.

35
00:02:31,527 --> 00:02:33,040
Really?

36
00:02:33,967 --> 00:02:37,926
I am reviewing the new pastry chef
at Chez Shea. And I quote:

37
00:02:38,127 --> 00:02:40,004
"His amaretto ëclair is so sinful,

38
00:02:40,167 --> 00:02:43,762
it will send you scurrying to your
local padre for absolution."

39
00:02:46,047 --> 00:02:47,958
No, thank you, Gil.
I'm on a diet, you see.

40
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:51,716
- Oh, come now, you know you want it.
- No, no, no, I really don't.

41
00:02:53,087 --> 00:02:55,157
Off you go. Bye-bye.

42
00:02:55,367 --> 00:02:56,846
- Oh, my God!
- What?

43
00:02:57,007 --> 00:02:58,520
- It was Gil!
- I never said that.

44
00:02:58,727 --> 00:03:00,240
- Then why are you blushing?
- Don't be ridiculous!

45
00:03:00,447 --> 00:03:01,960
- Your ears are turning red.
- I am not.

46
00:03:02,127 --> 00:03:03,879
You are.

47
00:03:07,647 --> 00:03:09,638
Still not blushing.

48
00:03:10,567 --> 00:03:13,035
MAN [CRYING]:
<i>Just lying there in the hospital bed,</i>

49
00:03:13,207 --> 00:03:15,323
<i>she lifted her head off the pillow,</i>

50
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:21,278
<i>looked up and said, "I love you."</i>
<i>And then she was gone.</i>

51
00:03:21,447 --> 00:03:23,563
Rudy, stop crying.

52
00:03:25,287 --> 00:03:26,959
Now, we've gone over this before.

53
00:03:27,127 --> 00:03:29,880
What was our agreement
about sad movies?

54
00:03:32,127 --> 00:03:35,358
- <i>I shouldn't watch them.</i>
- Exactly.

55
00:03:35,807 --> 00:03:37,160
Now, go get a cool washcloth

56
00:03:37,327 --> 00:03:39,443
to try to bring down
the puffiness around your eyes,

57
00:03:39,607 --> 00:03:43,043
and please stay away
from sad or depressing things.

58
00:03:43,207 --> 00:03:46,438
Which, at this moment, includes
listening to the <i>Frasier Crane Show.</i>

59
00:03:47,567 --> 00:03:49,046
Well, let's shoot it to the news.

60
00:03:49,247 --> 00:03:52,922
That's it for today.
This is Dr Frasier Crane.

61
00:03:53,407 --> 00:03:57,002
Oh, my God!
Well, close the record books.

62
00:03:57,167 --> 00:04:00,443
That was just the dullest three hours in
the history of the <i>Frasier Crane Show.</i>

63
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:02,120
Oh, come on, it wasn't so bad.

64
00:04:02,287 --> 00:04:04,676
What about the woman who was so
concerned about her appearance

65
00:04:04,847 --> 00:04:07,680
- she wouldn't leave the house?
- That was a commercial!

66
00:04:08,287 --> 00:04:11,165
I believe Miss Clairol
solved the problem.

67
00:04:11,487 --> 00:04:13,637
Well, I'll see you tomorrow, Roz.
Oh, Roz.

68
00:04:13,807 --> 00:04:16,196
About that dream I mentioned
to you earlier...

69
00:04:16,767 --> 00:04:19,042
It goes without saying,
I'd rather you didn't share that.

70
00:04:19,247 --> 00:04:22,398
- Oh, sure.
- Hi, dream boy.

71
00:04:23,767 --> 00:04:25,519
I hate you.

72
00:04:25,687 --> 00:04:27,359
Couldn't keep
your mouth shut, could you?

73
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:29,637
Just when did you find
the time to spread the news?

74
00:04:29,847 --> 00:04:32,407
You don't think I was listening
to your show, do you?

75
00:04:34,327 --> 00:04:35,965
BULLDOG:
Coming through!

76
00:04:36,127 --> 00:04:38,004
Oh, doc, I gotta rub
this one in a little.

77
00:04:38,167 --> 00:04:40,158
All right, Bulldog, before
you start to ridicule me,

78
00:04:40,327 --> 00:04:42,045
yes, yes, I had a dream about Gil,

79
00:04:42,247 --> 00:04:45,922
and, yes, it did have some
erotic elements, but...

80
00:04:46,127 --> 00:04:48,322
You have no idea what
I'm talking about, do you?

81
00:04:48,527 --> 00:04:50,961
I do now. Whoa!

82
00:04:52,527 --> 00:04:53,801
Look, let's just forget it.

83
00:04:53,967 --> 00:04:55,878
What delightful jibe did you
have prepared for me?

84
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:58,965
Oh, I was gonna tell you your show
today just broke the snooze-o-meter,

85
00:04:59,127 --> 00:05:02,403
but now I wanna hear about you
greasing Gil's cookie sheet.

86
00:05:04,207 --> 00:05:06,402
I'm on a bus to hell.

87
00:05:10,847 --> 00:05:13,486
So I returned to the dry cleaners
yet a third time.

88
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:15,797
I hardly need to tell you
how the story ends.

89
00:05:16,007 --> 00:05:17,884
Just tell me when the story ends.

90
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:22,200
Fine. They realigned
my pleats. The end.

91
00:05:22,367 --> 00:05:25,404
I'm sorry, Niles.
I'm just a bit distracted today.

92
00:05:25,567 --> 00:05:28,718
See, this morning a man
from my building,

93
00:05:28,887 --> 00:05:30,605
approached me with
an intriguing problem.

94
00:05:30,767 --> 00:05:33,156
Seems he's been having
a recurring dream.

95
00:05:33,327 --> 00:05:35,887
Please, that little gambit didn't work
when we were in knee socks.

96
00:05:36,087 --> 00:05:38,647
- What was your dream, Frasier?
- Oh, all right.

97
00:05:39,367 --> 00:05:43,246
It's been tormenting me. I haven't
been able to sleep in weeks now.

98
00:05:43,567 --> 00:05:47,845
It's a bit hazy, but it starts out
in a seedy motel room.

99
00:05:48,007 --> 00:05:49,759
- I'm naked.
- Interesting.

100
00:05:49,927 --> 00:05:53,363
Yes, well, I roll over
and discover on my forearm

101
00:05:53,527 --> 00:05:56,360
a tattoo with the word "chesty."

102
00:05:56,567 --> 00:05:59,400
- Interesting.
- Yes. And then the shower turns off.

103
00:05:59,607 --> 00:06:02,167
Out from the bathroom steps...

104
00:06:02,367 --> 00:06:03,641
...a man.

105
00:06:06,527 --> 00:06:07,960
All right, go ahead, let me have it.

106
00:06:08,727 --> 00:06:11,082
Are you saying that now,
or is that a quote from the dream?

107
00:06:13,807 --> 00:06:15,365
Please.

108
00:06:16,527 --> 00:06:19,087
We're too intelligent to waste time
on the obvious interpretation.

109
00:06:19,247 --> 00:06:22,398
Yes. But you must admit
it's rather intriguing.

110
00:06:22,567 --> 00:06:23,841
Would you stop?

111
00:06:24,047 --> 00:06:26,607
It's obviously screaming for
a Jungian interpretation.

112
00:06:26,767 --> 00:06:28,803
The sexuality in the dream
is surely symbolic

113
00:06:28,967 --> 00:06:31,083
of some deeper non-sexual conflict.

114
00:06:31,287 --> 00:06:34,882
- All right.
- Good afternoon, Frasier.

115
00:06:35,167 --> 00:06:37,044
- Gil.
- A little birdie tells me,

116
00:06:37,207 --> 00:06:39,880
I was featured in your midnight movie.

117
00:06:41,247 --> 00:06:42,600
Very clever. Off you go.

118
00:06:42,807 --> 00:06:44,365
Very well. See you tomorrow,

119
00:06:44,527 --> 00:06:47,360
or should I say,
see you in your dreams.

120
00:06:49,647 --> 00:06:51,478
In this dream of yours,
were there any cigars,

121
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:54,161
bananas or short, blunt swords?

122
00:06:54,567 --> 00:06:58,037
Would you stop it?
I'm 43, a little late for latency.

123
00:06:58,367 --> 00:07:00,483
- You guys okay over here?
- We're fine.

124
00:07:00,647 --> 00:07:02,638
Well, you must be new here.

125
00:07:02,807 --> 00:07:04,843
I would've remembered such
a pretty face as yours.

126
00:07:05,047 --> 00:07:06,878
- You're overcompensating.
- Right.

127
00:07:07,087 --> 00:07:08,964
We're fine. Bye-bye.

128
00:07:11,007 --> 00:07:15,046
I'm just baffled by it. Gil Chesterton
explains "chesty," but little else.

129
00:07:15,247 --> 00:07:17,477
You should tackle this from
a free-association standpoint.

130
00:07:17,647 --> 00:07:20,286
- Oh, God. Must we?
- Focus on a detail in the motel room.

131
00:07:20,447 --> 00:07:22,358
What's the first thing
that pops into your mind?

132
00:07:22,967 --> 00:07:24,320
A crescent-shaped lamp.

133
00:07:24,487 --> 00:07:27,399
Perfect. A crescent-shaped lamp.
Run with that.

134
00:07:27,607 --> 00:07:29,040
Crescent. Moon.

135
00:07:29,207 --> 00:07:30,959
Daphne Moon. French maid.

136
00:07:31,127 --> 00:07:33,641
- Brass bed. Satin rope.
- Niles!

137
00:07:35,487 --> 00:07:38,320
- This is my dream.
- I was just showing you the process.

138
00:07:38,527 --> 00:07:40,563
You were three words away
from a cigarette.

139
00:07:42,007 --> 00:07:43,804
- Your turn.
- All right.

140
00:07:43,967 --> 00:07:46,720
- Crescent lamp.
- Crescent.

141
00:07:47,207 --> 00:07:48,481
Croissant.

142
00:07:48,647 --> 00:07:51,719
Butter. Apricot jam.

143
00:07:52,087 --> 00:07:54,237
Hunger. Food. Diet.

144
00:07:54,647 --> 00:07:57,320
My God, I've been on a diet.
Do you think that's useful?

145
00:07:57,527 --> 00:07:59,677
You could stand to lose a few pounds.

146
00:08:00,967 --> 00:08:02,525
Just wait a minute.

147
00:08:03,167 --> 00:08:05,727
All right, Gil is a restaurant critic.
He's a gourmet.

148
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:08,162
Perhaps he's symbolic of the food
I've been denying myself.

149
00:08:08,327 --> 00:08:09,760
That would explain why you're naked.

150
00:08:09,967 --> 00:08:12,162
It's when we're most
self-conscious about our bodies.

151
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:15,245
Yes, and most vulnerable
to the way society tattoos us,

152
00:08:15,407 --> 00:08:18,285
with labels about our appearance.
Oh, my God, that's it, Niles.

153
00:08:18,447 --> 00:08:21,564
The dream is simply telling me that

00:16:42,287 --> 00:16:45,006
I'm sorry, Dad. I wasn't completely
truthful with you before.

307
00:16:45,167 --> 00:16:48,921
The dream is really about me in
a motel room with a male companion,

308
00:16:49,087 --> 00:16:50,236
Gil Chesterton.

309
00:16:50,847 --> 00:16:53,805
You don't care if I ever
sleep again, do you?

310
00:16:54,487 --> 00:16:56,239
Dad, please.
I'd really like to discuss this.

311
00:16:56,407 --> 00:16:58,682
MARTIN: No, Frasier, please.
This makes me very uncomfortable.

312
00:16:58,847 --> 00:17:00,565
FRASIER: Dad, please?
- I know, I know.

313
00:17:00,727 --> 00:17:03,321
In your generation,
men talk about everything.

314
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:05,045
Everything's out in the open.

315
00:17:05,367 --> 00:17:09,076
You know, what really drives me crazy
is the way you all touch each other.

316
00:17:09,247 --> 00:17:11,761
Everybody hugs, you know.

317
00:17:11,927 --> 00:17:14,441
In my generation,
it was a handshake.

318
00:17:14,607 --> 00:17:16,040
That was good enough,

319
00:17:16,247 --> 00:17:18,203
and maybe if you felt
especially close to someone,

320
00:17:18,367 --> 00:17:21,404
you could touch them on the shoulder,
but never for more than two seconds.

321
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:23,723
And don't talk to me
about football players

322
00:17:23,887 --> 00:17:27,243
patting people's butts and everything
because that's different. That's sports.

323
00:17:27,407 --> 00:17:29,967
- That's like war. Now, good night, son.
- Dad!

324
00:17:30,127 --> 00:17:32,243
If you wanna tell me something,
write it on a Post-it,

325
00:17:32,407 --> 00:17:35,604
- and stick it on the fridge.
- Look, I really want to talk about this.

326
00:17:35,807 --> 00:17:38,082
I've exhausted every other
interpretation of this dream.

327
00:17:38,247 --> 00:17:40,966
Is it possible my subconscious
is trying to tell me

328
00:17:41,127 --> 00:17:42,719
something about my sexuality?

329
00:17:42,927 --> 00:17:44,758
- Oh, that's ridiculous!
- Is it?

330
00:17:45,527 --> 00:17:47,518
I was sensitive as a child.

331
00:17:47,687 --> 00:17:49,040
I didn't go in for sports.

332
00:17:49,207 --> 00:17:50,765
God, it's every clichë in the book.

333
00:17:50,967 --> 00:17:52,958
Surely it must have occurred
to you at some point.

334
00:17:53,167 --> 00:17:55,601
You refused to take me to see
<i>West Side Story</i> on my birthday.

335
00:17:55,807 --> 00:17:56,842
Well, because of the gangs.

336
00:17:57,007 --> 00:17:59,043
- That's scary for kids.
- Even gangs that dance?

337
00:17:59,207 --> 00:18:01,562
Especially gangs that dance.

338
00:18:04,527 --> 00:18:07,963
All right, yeah, okay.
Yeah, I thought about it,

339
00:18:08,167 --> 00:18:11,045
but, no, Frasier, no.
I don't believe that.

340
00:18:11,207 --> 00:18:14,085
And you know why? Because
you would've known by now.

341
00:18:14,567 --> 00:18:16,956
Your unconscious or whatever
the hell you call it

342
00:18:17,127 --> 00:18:20,085
could no more have kept its
yap shut than the rest of you.

343
00:18:22,247 --> 00:18:23,680
- I suppose you're right.
- Yeah.

344
00:18:23,887 --> 00:18:25,161
Now, come on, it's after 3.

345
00:18:25,327 --> 00:18:27,283
You're gonna be worn out
before the show tomorrow.

346
00:18:27,447 --> 00:18:30,200
- What a tragedy that would be.
- Now what're you complaining about?

347
00:18:30,407 --> 00:18:32,079
Oh, no, just...

348
00:18:32,247 --> 00:18:34,283
I haven't had any
really interesting calls lately.

349
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:36,802
I'm beginning to question
whether I'm bored with psychiatry.

350
00:18:36,967 --> 00:18:41,245
You'd never know it the way you got
your nose stuck in all those books.

351
00:18:41,447 --> 00:18:42,721
That's true.

352
00:18:42,887 --> 00:18:44,400
The one saving grace about this dream

353
00:18:44,567 --> 00:18:47,320
is it's given me a chance to flex
my analytical muscle a bit.

354
00:18:47,527 --> 00:18:49,199
So maybe it wasn't so bad after all.

355
00:18:49,647 --> 00:18:51,239
Wait a minute.

356
00:18:51,807 --> 00:18:54,367
Could that be what this
has been all about?

357
00:18:54,527 --> 00:18:56,836
I've been so intellectually
unchallenged lately by my show

358
00:18:57,007 --> 00:19:01,319
that my mind had to create
a dream that defies interpretation

359
00:19:01,487 --> 00:19:04,285
- just to give me a challenge?
- I don't know, keep talking.

360
00:19:04,447 --> 00:19:06,039
You're making me sleepy.

361
00:19:08,087 --> 00:19:09,361
Dad, no, that's got to be it!

362
00:19:09,527 --> 00:19:12,678
My show hasn't provided me with
a single patient worthy of my skills.

363
00:19:12,847 --> 00:19:14,997
And I had to invent one myself. Me.

364
00:19:15,207 --> 00:19:17,402
Oh, God, what a relief.

365
00:19:17,607 --> 00:19:20,246
At last, finally, to bed.
Dad, you witnessed an epiphany.

366
00:19:20,407 --> 00:19:22,477
MARTIN: Yeah, God, I gotta
get you to put this on tape.

367
00:19:22,647 --> 00:19:24,080
FRASIER:
Well, off we go.

- You're a brilliant psychiatrist.

Oh, that's very flattering, but there are
so many things I'd like to ask you.
