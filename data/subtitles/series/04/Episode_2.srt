1
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:13,141
Baby, baby, all I'm saying
is we should cool it for a while.

2
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:14,757
No, what's that thing?

3
00:00:14,973 --> 00:00:16,372
"If you love something, let it go.

4
00:00:16,599 --> 00:00:18,669
If it comes back to you..."
Yadda yadda yadda.

5
00:00:18,935 --> 00:00:20,607
Yeah, that's it.

6
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:23,493
Hey, don't get me wrong,
I'm really broken up about this.

7
00:00:23,773 --> 00:00:25,764
Hey, think fast.

8
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:32,111
Come on, now--

9
00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:34,571
No tears. No...

10
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:37,545
I'll never forget you either, Sandy.

11
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:40,821
Linda? Really?

12
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:42,876
Well, I thought I was talking
to your sister.

13
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:45,196
Oh, well, tell her same goes.

14
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,713
- Hey, Frasier, do you have a minute?
- Yes, of course, Roz. What is it?

15
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:51,487
Well, you're not gonna
like this idea.

16
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:53,310
You're gonna complain
and make up excuses

17
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:54,588
and then say no anyway.

18
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:58,395
That's the very words I would use
to woo my dear Lilith.

19
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:00,333
Okay, here goes.

20
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,393
I have this friend and I think you two
would really hit it off.

21
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,686
You were wondering if I might
meet her for a drink,

22
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,249
which might lead to dinner,
and after that, who knows where?

23
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:09,595
Yes, exactly.

24
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:11,863
Oh, listen, Roz, did you hear that?

25
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:13,429
What?

26
00:01:13,698 --> 00:01:15,211
If you listen very carefully...

27
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,760
...you can actually hear
my skin crawling.

28
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:23,606
I know, blind dates stink.
But I'm your friend,

29
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,555
- and I'm worried about you.
- Well, Roz...

30
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:27,985
When was the last time
you were with a woman?

31
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:31,333
- Seems like almost a year.
- Oh, it has not been that long.

32
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:33,908
I mean, that is a laugh.

33
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:36,494
The last time was...

34
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:39,940
Well, let me see, the...

35
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:43,429
Well, the tree was still up.
Oh, God.

36
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:45,457
Her name is Sharon.
She's 5'7".

37
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:48,203
- Oh, Roz, I'm not interested.
- But she's an incredible person.

38
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:51,281
She's smart, she's funny.
She's a former pro golfer.

39
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:54,083
- She just hasn't met the right guy.
- A woman golfer?

40
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:57,117
Are we quite certain
there is a right guy?

41
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,088
- She dates men.
- Not this one.

42
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:02,000
She plays chess.
She loves your show.

43
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,480
I know this isn't supposed to
matter to people like you,

44
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:06,387
but I've seen her in the shower
at the gym,

45
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:09,936
she has a body that makes
Bo Derek look like Bo Diddley.

46
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:14,073
A chess player, did you say?

47
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:20,992
Look at these pants.

48
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:24,660
Oh, dear, Mr. Crane. Did Eddie
drag you through the puddles again?

49
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,692
Every last one of them.

50
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:29,088
Eddie, get in here.

51
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:31,037
Eddie, I mean now.

52
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:37,650
What am I gonna do with you?
My favorite shoes are soaked.

53
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:42,196
Eddie, look at me
when I'm talking to you.

54
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:44,213
- You're doing it again.
- What?

55
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:46,447
You're acting like one of those
nutjobs in the park

56
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,505
- who treat their pets like children.
- Yeah?

57
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:50,431
Well, when you do it outside,
you're a nut.

58
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,104
When you do it inside,
it's your own damn business.

59
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:56,521
Eddie, go to your room.

60
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:02,068
Oh, don't worry about your shoes.
I'll get them all dried out for you.

61
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,950
Well, I hope.
They're not just any shoes, you know.

62
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:08,260
These are Muckabees,
the most comfortable shoes made.

63
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:12,078
Air-cushioned insoles,
deep flannel lining.

64
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,709
You know, I remember
one anniversary I surprised Hester

65
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:17,098
with a pair of Lady Muckabees.

66
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:20,720
Don't remember which anniversary,
but I know it ended with a zero.

67
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,817
I don't doubt that.

68
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:34,119
Oh, all right. I forgive you.

69
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:36,694
I love you too. Yeah.

70
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:40,276
You'll always be my very best boy.

71
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:46,275
You know, Dad, there are some
fathers who actually praise their sons

72
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:48,515
and whistle at their dogs.

73
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,500
- New suit, huh? Who's the lucky girl?
- If you must know,

74
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:54,454
I'm meeting a friend of Roz's today
after work, but it's no big deal.

75
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:57,567
Well, congratulations.
What's it been, a year?

76
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,895
It has not been that long.

77
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:06,238
I remember the tree was still up.

78
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:11,100
Well, look at you, all got up
like a dog's dinner.

79
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:15,972
Yes, it's a new suit. Yes, I'm meeting a
woman. And, yes, it has been a while.

80
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:20,935
Thanks. That reminds me,
I have to order me cards.

81
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:27,044
Daphne, are you finished here
with the microwave?

82
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,625
Oh, no.

83
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:35,457
- My Muckabees!
- I'm sorry.

84
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,731
I didn't mean to leave them
in there for so long.

85
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:41,179
Yes, well, English cooking
strikes again.

86
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:49,517
You should be happy your patient feels
healthy enough to terminate therapy.

87
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:52,945
I would, but it's happened so often
lately I find myself in financial straits.

88
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:55,685
Deep financial straits.

89
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:59,875
Look at this belt. Spanish leather.

90
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:04,346
If Mr. Blackwell comes in, I'll create a
diversion, you can make a dash for it.

91
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,989
Obviously the time has come for me
to expand my practice,

92
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:10,985
so I'm placing an ad
in <i>Seattle Style</i> magazine.

93
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:14,735
Advertisement? Isn't that a bit
commercial for a psychiatrist?

94
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:18,023
Said Dr. Pot to Dr. Kettle.

95
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:23,445
Besides, a highly respected
obstetrician on my floor did it,

96
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:27,733
and now his waiting room has more
swollen bellies than a Buddhist temple.

97
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:30,148
- Good one, yes.
- I liked it.

98
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:34,088
Here. I'm on my way to call it in,
I just wanted to run it by you.

99
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:38,012
All right.
"Dr. Niles Crane, Jung specialist.

100
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:42,126
Servicing individuals, couples,
groups. Satisfaction guaranteed.

101
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:47,177
Tell me where it hurts."
Well, that's just excellent, Niles.

102
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:49,546
All you're missing now
is a very tasteful cartoon

103
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:52,925
of you smiling brightly
and holding a shrunken head.

104
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,488
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.
I was too distracted by your face

105
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:59,287
going by on the side of a bus.

106
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:01,523
I'm off.

107
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,136
- Hey, wild thing.
- Yes, hello.

108
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:09,924
- Look, we have on the same belt.
- Oh, my God.

109
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:12,069
- Hi, Roz.
- Hey, Frasier.

110
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:14,119
- Sharon's gonna be here any minute.
- You didn't say anything, did you?

111
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,410
Not a word. She has no idea
this is a set-up.

112
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,223
Good. Now, listen, if I don't like her,

113
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:21,658
I will simply excuse myself and leave.
But if like her, I will find some polite

114
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:24,843
and discreet way of indicating
that you may go.

115
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:27,610
Beat it, Roz.

116
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:32,479
- Hi, Sharon.
- Hi, Roz.

117
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:35,399
Look who I ran into, my boss,
Dr. Frasier Crane.

118
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:37,359
- Hello.
- This is Sharon Payton.

119
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:39,516
Pleased to meet you.
I'm a big fan of your show.

120
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:41,886
- Thank you.
- I'm sure you're tired of hearing that.

121
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:45,667
- You probably get it all the time.
- Oh, well, not lately.

122
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:51,350
Listen, Sharon, I'm so sorry to do this,
but I just got a call from the office,

123
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:55,210
- and it's urgent and I have to go.
- Oh, sure, that's all right.

124
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:58,460
Well, you know, as long as you're
here, you might as well join me.

125
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:00,951
That'd be nice.

126
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:04,249
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye, Roz.

127
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:09,073
You know, I really do love
listening to your show.

128
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:11,776
I think it's because you have
such a soothing voice.

129
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,737
What a very kind thing to say.

130
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:18,248
I almost called in once.

131
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,948
Really? May I ask what
the problem was?

132
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:27,429
Well, I'm terribly competitive, which is
great for sports, I used to play pro golf,

133
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:29,820
but sometimes it seeps
into my personal life.

134
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:32,676
Well, I don't really think
that's too great a problem,

135
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:35,420
but if I were to make
a recommendation, it might be to...

136
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:38,265
...start seeing a therapist.

137
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:39,811
Whoa.

138
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:41,556
- Hello, gorgeous.
- Hi, Bulldog.

139
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:45,231
Not you. Hey, aren't you
gonna introduce me?

140
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:47,982
- Well, actually, I wasn't, no.
- Bob Brisco.

141
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:49,939
- Sharon Payton.
- Yes, good to see you.

142
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:51,896
- Don't be a stranger.
- Hey, wait a minute.

143
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,853
Wait a minute. Sharon Payton.
I know you.

144
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:58,213
LPGA, you won
the Denver Open, 1992.

145
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:01,758
1992. That was a fabulous year for a
particular Chambertin I took a shine to--

146
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:05,740
I know you too. You're that guy
that said golf is not a sport.

147
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:07,464
- Well, it's not.
- Really?

148
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:12,372
Yeah. No cheerleaders, no blood, the
only cups involved are in the ground.

149
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:15,901
This reminds me of a debate I had with
my brother Niles about whether or not

150
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:17,796
Stephen Sondheim
is really light opera.

151
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:20,269
You know, I have a theory that people
who put down golf

152
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:22,498
do so because they can't play well.

153
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:24,864
- Is that a challenge?
- It might be.

154
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,968
If we leave now,
we could get in nine holes.

155
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:29,171
- Loser buys dinner.
- I got a nine handicap.

156
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,776
You're on. Frasier, would you like
to join us?

157
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:35,451
- Well, no, I don't play.
- Well, it was really nice meeting you.

158
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:37,718
- Likewise.
- I'll get my coat.

159
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:41,093
Bulldog. Listen, Roz set this up
that I might meet Sharon.

160
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:43,387
Things were going
in a very positive direction.

161
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:45,764
Yeah, well, things seem
to have changed, haven't they?

162
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:49,655
- What do you call that? Irony?
- Is there nothing I can do

163
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:52,980
- to appeal to your sense of decency?
- Hey, I have no sense of decency.

164
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:55,042
That way, my other senses
are enhanced.

165
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:05,515
But the real secret of Muckabees

166
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:08,552
is that they mold themselves
to the shape of your foot.

167
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:11,316
Now, my problem was always
hammertoes.

168
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:14,346
If you had hammertoes, you'd have
a hell of a time finding shoes.

169
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:18,186
But Muckabees fit over
my hammertoes like a glove.

170
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,396
Funny, you know,
when you're young,

171
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:26,444
you dream about fame and fortune.
When you get to be my age,

172
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:29,645
all you really want out of life
is a comfy pair of shoes.

173
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:34,138
Right now I'd settle for never hearing
the word "hammertoes" again.

174
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:37,649
Hey, don't give me any attitude.
Wasn't me that nuked the Muckabees.

175
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:40,110
I'm not the one who can't remember
where the store is

176
00:09:40,372 --> 00:09:43,364
- where you bought the damn shoes.
- Just drive. I'll tell you when to stop.

177
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,699
Stop!

178
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:48,770
- Is that it?
- It's a red light.

179
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:54,788
- In this country, we stop for those.
- All right, all right.

180
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:58,977
- Woman driver.
- Hammertoes.

181
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:11,437
Frasier.

182
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:17,337
What? Haven't you
spoken with Sharon?

183
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:20,935
I tried, but she wasn't home
all weekend.

184
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:23,441
Frasier.

185
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:27,104
Look, before you snap my behind
with a wet towel,

186
00:10:27,419 --> 00:10:31,492
the last time I saw Sharon was leaving
Café Nervosa with Bulldog.

187
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,599
Frasier! How could you
let that happen?

188
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:36,800
Well, I don't know. The whole thing
is sort of a blur. We were talking about

189
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:39,893
golf and something called a handicap,
the next thing I know, I'm sitting

190
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:43,651
with a cappuccino, muttering to myself
in a very soothing voice.

191
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:46,305
- I'm sorry.
- Well, it's all right, Roz.

192
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:49,202
It's just the whole thing just
catapulted me back to high school.

193
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:52,633
You've only known me as an adult,
but back then I was rather

194
00:10:52,944 --> 00:10:55,697
- an unathletic, bookish sort.
- Get out.

195
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,755
Jocks were the bane
of my existence.

196
00:10:58,033 --> 00:11:01,742
They called me a weenie, and they
would steal all the girls that I wanted.

197
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:04,911
Oh, Frasier, you must have had
some girlfriends.

198
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:08,721
Friends, yeah. Yeah, any time they
wanted a sensitive shoulder to cry on,

199
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:11,679
but some blockheaded pillar
of testosterone would come and it was:

200
00:11:11,963 --> 00:11:14,557
"Bye, Fras,
maybe we can study later."

201
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:18,603
Then I'd head home to Niles and we'd
put on the <i>Brandenburg Concertos</i>

202
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:22,482
and play air violin.

203
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:28,287
Gee, what a couple of nerdlingers.

204
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:30,960
Oh, and I suppose you were
Miss Popular in high school.

205
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:34,311
- I would say yes.
- I'm guessing that explains why too.

206
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:39,563
Hey, guys.

207
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:44,757
- What a weekend.
- Listen, Bulldog, Sharon is my friend,

208
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:48,629
- and you better not hurt her.
- What--? Hurt her?

209
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,711
I am crazy about her.

210
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:54,153
I never felt this way before.

211
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:56,572
You know, on my way to work,

212
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:59,913
all these songs on the radio
suddenly made sense to me.

213
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:06,332
Have you ever listened to the words
to "Time In A Bottle"?

214
00:12:06,685 --> 00:12:09,358
It is so beautiful, man,
I had to pull over.

215
00:12:09,688 --> 00:12:11,679
Oh, my God, it's in love.

216
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:15,974
And last night,
for the first time in my life,

217
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:19,053
I actually said those
three little words:

218
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:21,673
"Stay for breakfast."

219
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:24,869
- You had sex with Sharon?
- Doc, please.

220
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:29,807
We made love. You know what?
I gotta call her.

221
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,043
No, wait, no, I gotta play hard to get.

222
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:36,226
But I miss the sound of her voice.
I'm calling her. No, wait, it's too needy.

223
00:12:36,548 --> 00:12:39,142
Chicks hate that. I shouldn't call her.

224
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:43,066
But I want to. Doc, what should I do?

225
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:46,502
Don't ask me.
I don't even know who you are.

226
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:53,329
This was it.
This was the Muckabees store.

227
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:56,074
Now it's gone and so are
the only shoes I ever loved.

228
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:57,834
Mr. Crane, look at me.

229
00:12:58,069 --> 00:13:01,584
We're talking here about something
that's old and smelly and dirty.

230
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:03,134
Hey.

231
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:07,234
Not you. We're talking
about Muckabees.

232
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:11,325
Oh, great shoes.
Used to sell them here.

233
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,938
- What happened to the store?
- Moved.

234
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:17,927
- Do you know where?
- Yeah. It'll cost you.

235
00:13:18,882 --> 00:13:23,558
- How much?
- No, not money. I want a kiss.

236
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:25,498
What?

237
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:27,872
- You heard him.
- Mr. Crane.

238
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:30,814
You burned them, you owe me.
It's only a kiss.

239
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:33,419
Not her.

240
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:44,142
This is Dr. Frasier Crane,
KACL 780 talk radio.

241
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:45,760
Thought you'd never finish.

242
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:48,460
You know, Niles, what say I buy us
dinner and a lot of martinis.

243
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:50,940
Sounds great except
for the dinner part.

244
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:54,535
- I take it you had a bad day too?
- I had an abysmal day.

245
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:57,507
- Remember the ad I placed?
- Oh, yes. Dr. Niles Crane,

246
00:13:57,796 --> 00:14:01,152
- Jung specialist, blah blah blah.
- Well, they've made a tiny little typo.

247
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:03,457
See if you can find it.

248
00:14:05,136 --> 00:14:08,333
"Niles Crane, hung specialist."

249
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:13,462
Oh, my.

250
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:16,075
The rest they got perfectly.

251
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:19,670
"Servicing individuals, couples,

252
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:23,484
groups.

253
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:27,284
Satisfaction guaranteed.

254
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:30,264
Tell me where it hurts."

255
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,593
Well, any calls?

256
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,716
- It's a telethon.
- Yes, well...

257
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:43,035
- We'll start with double martinis.
- All right.

258
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:47,379
Wait a second. I need the name of one
of those fancy restaurants you go to.

259
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:50,591
Hey, hi, Sharon, it's me, Bob.

260
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,006
Hey, I had a great time last night.

261
00:14:53,268 --> 00:14:55,145
Listen, how about dinner tonight?

262
00:14:55,979 --> 00:14:57,458
You do?

263
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,457
All right, how about tomorrow night?

264
00:15:01,693 --> 00:15:05,925
Hey, it's a good thing I'm not paranoid,
I'd think you were dumping me.

265
00:15:06,865 --> 00:15:09,015
Well, I walked into that one.

266
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:14,380
Yeah, me too. Good luck, Shar--

267
00:15:15,457 --> 00:15:19,132
- Gee, I'm sorry, Bulldog.
- Me too.

268
00:15:19,461 --> 00:15:22,339
I'll call Francois, see if he can
get us a table on the patio.

269
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:25,664
- Ten seconds, Bulldog.
- Oh, right, right, right.

270
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:29,243
- Listen, are you gonna be all right?
- What, me? Are you kidding?

271
00:15:29,554 --> 00:15:31,226
I'm the Bulldog.

272
00:15:32,015 --> 00:15:34,768
Attention, sports fans,
you're in the Doghouse.

273
00:15:36,311 --> 00:15:40,145
Uh...
First, some weekend scores.

274
00:15:40,482 --> 00:15:44,521
In football, the Packers
crushed the Saints 42-10,

275
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:49,218
and the 49ers humiliated
the Patriots 35-7.

276
00:15:49,574 --> 00:15:51,485
And in golf...

277
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:55,482
Golf, hey, golf sucks, right?
Go to calls.

278
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:58,781
You're in the Doghouse.
Put on a flea collar.

279
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:00,645
We have the table,
but Francois says

280
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:02,993
- he can only hold it for ten minutes.
- In a minute.

281
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:04,812
<i>Anyway, what's up with the rumor</i>

282
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:07,801
<i>that the Seahawks are thinking</i>
<i>of leaving Seattle again?</i>

283
00:16:08,093 --> 00:16:09,651
I have no respect for that, man.

284
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:13,735
Anyone who has their fun,
then they just leave you,

285
00:16:14,057 --> 00:16:17,413
well, hey, to hell with them, right?
We'll get another team.

286
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:21,356
A team that-- A team that
won't ever leave us.

287
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:24,045
A team we can love forever.

288
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:26,827
- You'd better go to commercial.
- I already did.

289
00:16:27,696 --> 00:16:29,368
Bulldog, are you gonna be all right?

290
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:31,377
Do you think you can tape the show?

291
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:36,034
Wait, Bulldog, we need a tape.
Where's the <i>Best of Bulldog</i>?

292
00:16:36,371 --> 00:16:38,248
She took the best of Bulldog.

293
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:42,680
- We've got dead air in 15 seconds.
- Oh, great. Okay, I'll go get Bulldog.

294
00:16:43,003 --> 00:16:45,961
- You take over the show.
- Me? A sports show?

295
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:48,606
You're the only one here.

296
00:16:56,057 --> 00:16:59,367
Okay, sports enthusiasts,
this is Dr. Frasier Crane

297
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:02,200
filling in for Bob "Bulldog" Brisco.

298
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:06,223
- You're on the air.
- <i>This is Mike.</i>

299
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:08,475
<i>I wanted to talk to Bulldog,</i>
<i>but you'll do.</i>

300
00:17:08,737 --> 00:17:11,729
<i>So, what's your take on</i>
<i>the damn Yankees this season?</i>

301
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:16,867
Are you speaking of the frothy musical
adaptation of the Faustian myth

302
00:17:17,412 --> 00:17:19,721
or the baseball team
of which I know nothing?

303
00:17:20,457 --> 00:17:22,527
<i>What a weenie.</i>

304
00:17:23,126 --> 00:17:25,356
Doesn't that take me back.

305
00:17:25,754 --> 00:17:28,188
But he brings up a good point.
You see, while I'm on the air,

306
00:17:28,465 --> 00:17:31,855
please feel free to call in about
anything other than sports. Please.

307
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:34,527
Hello, you're on the air.

308
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:36,874
<i>You think it was</i>
<i>a good idea for the Sonics</i>

309
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,334
<i>to give up those draft choices</i>

310
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:40,389
<i>so they could free up some money</i>
<i>under the cap?</i>

311
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:43,874
<i>You know, to go after a wide body</i>
<i>to help them in the paint?</i>

312
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:47,643
Yes.

313
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:52,394
You're on the air.

314
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:54,847
Bulldog!

315
00:17:55,116 --> 00:17:58,870
I know you're in there. Get out here.

316
00:17:59,204 --> 00:18:04,232
Give me a break, Leonard. Like you
haven't fantasized about this moment.

317
00:18:05,126 --> 00:18:07,594
- Go away, Roz.
- Will you grow up.

318
00:18:07,879 --> 00:18:09,437
So you got dumped.

319
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:13,104
You got a little payback for the way
you treated women all your life.

320
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:17,499
Besides, the Bulldog I know
doesn't get sad.

321
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:19,758
- He gets angry.
- You're right.

322
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:24,912
This stinks! This is total, total B.S.

323
00:18:27,399 --> 00:18:30,550
If you don't come out in the next three
seconds, I'm gonna reach in there

324
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:35,012
- and drag you out by your ankles.
- Hello, Roz, playing hard to get?

325
00:18:37,242 --> 00:18:39,881
It's Bulldog. You're a psychiatrist.
Help him.

326
00:18:40,203 --> 00:18:43,400
As distressed as I am by his condition,
he's not the only one suffering here.

327
00:18:43,707 --> 00:18:45,777
In eight minutes we are going
to lose our patio table.

328
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:49,398
Well, as long as Frasier's filling in
for Bulldog, you're not going anywhere.

329
00:18:49,713 --> 00:18:51,510
You poor man. Help is at hand.

330
00:18:53,008 --> 00:18:55,681
No! No shrinks! I hate shrinks.

331
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:58,244
You're all a bunch of
wimps, weirdos.

332
00:18:59,097 --> 00:19:01,053
Help me.

333
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:05,392
There, there. I'm here for you.

334
00:19:05,687 --> 00:19:08,520
And you're over there for me.

335
00:19:11,276 --> 00:19:13,995
Well, I sense you're
in a great deal of pain.

336
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:16,918
- Yeah. Make it stop.
- No.

337
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,549
No, the first step toward healing
is not to bury the pain,

338
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:21,305
but to feel it at its fullest depths.

339
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:29,146
Okay, well, before security arrives,
let's skip on to step two.

340
00:19:30,754 --> 00:19:33,473
- What is going on?
- Excuse me. Frasier, we're in session.

341
00:19:33,757 --> 00:19:36,066
We have to pull him together
in minutes, not in a lifetime.

342
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:40,499
- How dare you talk to me like that.
- We don't have time for this. Get out!

343
00:19:40,889 --> 00:19:42,481
Bulldog, I'm referring you
to my brother.

344
00:19:42,724 --> 00:19:44,794
I'll call Francois and tell him
there's been a death.

345
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:47,290
That ought to buy us
another ten minutes.

346
00:19:47,562 --> 00:19:50,599
We're on a newsbreak. You have got
to pull yourself together because

347
00:19:50,899 --> 00:19:52,855
there is no way I am enduring
any more humiliation.

348
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:55,259
- I am not going out there, man.
- You have got to.

349
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:58,440
I can't even decipher the abbreviations
on the score sheets. I'm guessing

350
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:02,255
by your producer's guffaws that it is
not the Cleveland Independents.

351
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:07,688
I just never felt this way
about a chick before.

352
00:20:09,501 --> 00:20:12,732
I was even thinking about
her and me having kids.

353
00:20:13,213 --> 00:20:16,125
- Isn't that scary?
- Positively bone-chilling.

354
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:20,201
- It hurts like hell.
- I know. I know, Bulldog.

355
00:20:20,512 --> 00:20:23,902
You know, often through pain
we can achieve emotional growth.

356
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:26,374
It reminds me of a paper
I recently presented

357
00:20:26,643 --> 00:20:28,793
to the Vancouver Psychiatric
Association. The gravamen

358
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:31,530
of my discourse was that
the sufferer, i.e. you--

359
00:20:31,815 --> 00:20:34,534
Doc, doc, you're hurting
my head here.

360
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:38,454
Can't you stop being a shrink
and just be, like, a guy?

361
00:20:38,822 --> 00:20:40,460
Like a guy.

362
00:20:43,994 --> 00:20:45,950
Like a guy.

363
00:20:47,622 --> 00:20:49,533
Screw her!

364
00:20:50,959 --> 00:20:52,597
- What?
- Yeah, you don't need her.

365
00:20:52,836 --> 00:20:54,474
She's trash!

366
00:20:55,255 --> 00:20:57,689
- Yeah, trash.
- You're better off! We both are!

367
00:20:58,008 --> 00:20:59,805
- I like the sound of this.
- Yeah, so do I!

368
00:21:00,051 --> 00:21:02,519
It's unattractive, yet liberating.
Like the one and only time

369
00:21:02,804 --> 00:21:04,681
I wore a European bathing suit.

370
00:21:04,973 --> 00:21:09,330
- Oh, I'm sorry. She's a bitch!
- Hey, she wasn't even that hot.

371
00:21:09,728 --> 00:21:12,117
All she did was save you
the trouble of having to dump her.

372
00:21:12,439 --> 00:21:14,236
- I never thought about that.
- There you go.

373
00:21:14,482 --> 00:21:15,915
- I'm feeling a little better.
- That's right.

374
00:21:16,151 --> 00:21:17,550
- Thanks.
- Come on.

375
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:19,495
- It's great talking to you.
- Likewise.

376
00:21:19,738 --> 00:21:22,696
You know, I could talk like this
for another 30 seconds.

377
00:21:23,575 --> 00:21:24,610
She was nothing!

378
00:21:24,826 --> 00:21:27,340
- She was less than nothing!
- Yeah, right.

379
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,292
Tomorrow you're gonna find
somebody even hotter,

380
00:21:29,581 --> 00:21:31,060
and you know
what you're gonna do?

381
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:35,170
You're gonna have your fun with her
and dump her just for the hell of it!

382
00:21:36,713 --> 00:21:38,544
- Yeah, dump her!
- And you know what?

383
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:41,107
You're not gonna feel bad
about it at all. You know why?

384
00:21:41,384 --> 00:21:44,103
Because we're guys,
and that's what guys do!

385
00:21:46,306 --> 00:21:48,820
Distressing news, Frasier.
Francois gave away our table.

386
00:21:49,142 --> 00:21:50,621
Screw him!

387
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:52,872
- Excuse me?
- You heard me!

388
00:21:53,146 --> 00:21:55,785
We don't need him or his stinky little
restaurant. There are plenty

389
00:21:56,066 --> 00:21:59,900
of restaurants. I say we go somewhere
we don't even need a reservation!

390
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:04,585
- Thank you, Niles.
- You're welcome.

391
00:22:04,866 --> 00:22:08,541
If we hasten, perhaps we can catch
the first seating at Monsieur Galbolon.
