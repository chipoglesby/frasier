1
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,284
Look, we had an agreement.

2
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:14,442
We went to a movie I wanted to see,
so I was supposed to pay for the ticket.

3
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:17,647
Very well, Dad. The next time we go
to a Jean-Claude Van Damme movie,

4
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,488
not only may you pay for the tickets,

5
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:23,802
but also for the wild horses
it will take to drag me there.

6
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:26,086
Well, I'm only mad because
we had an agreement.

7
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,366
Now, a man's supposed to honour
his agreements.

8
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:30,122
Didn't you learn anything
from that movie?

9
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:31,928
Only that bullets are useless
against a man

10
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:34,001
who can kick really high.

11
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:39,039
Now, look, I'm serious about this.
Once in a while, I'd like to pay.

12
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:40,239
- Okay.
- MARTIN: Okay.

13
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:42,970
So the next time we go anywhere,
it's on me. Have I made my point?

14
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,559
Yes, Dad, with all the subtlety
that Mr Van Damme displayed

15
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:49,848
when he jet-packed into the Vatican to
subdue that nasty old pope impostor.

16
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,041
Like you saw that coming.

17
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:55,878
Well, Maris has finally deigned
to call me back,

18
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:57,642
after I've left no fewer than
20 messages.

19
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:01,200
Honestly, Niles, by calling her so many
times, you give her all the power.

20
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:03,725
You're much better off coming
from a position of strength.

21
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:06,245
Don't pour that sherry on your shirt.
It will stain.

22
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:08,319
- What?
- I'm sorry.

23
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:10,287
I thought this was
the portion of the afternoon

24
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:12,361
where we gave each
other patently obvious advice.

25
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:16,645
I had to call Maris for that party I'm
throwing for my country club friends.

26
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:19,529
Oh, yes, the one I wasn't invited to
but my Waterford punchbowl was.

27
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:23,569
Yes, well, Maris has chosen the same
night to throw a party of her own.

28
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:25,761
- Couldn't you ask her to postpone?
- I tried.

29
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:29,519
She's already flown in a sculptor from
Sweden to capture her likeness in ice.

30
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:33,849
Ah, the perfect marriage
of subject and medium.

31
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:36,801
Well, you can see my problem.

32
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:39,768
We're going to be competing now
for which friends go to which party.

33
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:43,206
You know, Niles, for a separated
couple still hoping to reconcile,

34
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:45,088
I'm afraid you're going down
a path that...

35
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:47,724
You shouldn't wear that tie
with that jacket.

36
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:52,359
Oh, is that your clever way of telling
me I'm dispensing unwanted criticism?

37
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:53,639
That too.

38
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:57,682
- Hello, boys.
- Hello, Daphne.

39
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:00,569
Oh, Dr Crane. Will you be
joining us for dinner?

40
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:04,689
- What a nice invitation. I'd love to.
- Well, then, you're in for a treat.

41
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:08,087
I've decided to make Grammy Moon's
famous sheep's head stew.

42
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:10,840
Oh, don't worry,
the name's a bit misleading.

43
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:13,120
It's actually more of a soup.

44
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:17,287
You actually use a real sheep's head?

45
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:21,563
- Oh, you have to. It's right in here.
- Oh, my God! I just remembered,

46
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:23,448
we have reservations
at Le Cigare Volant!

47
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:27,245
- Oh, my God, you're right!
- Gee, is that tonight? I nearly forgot.

48
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:29,759
- You're going too, Mr Crane?
- Well, I promised the boys.

49
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:32,763
I don't suppose there's any way
you guys would let me out of this.

50
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:34,329
- Well...
- You promised.

51
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,407
MARTIN:
See, I tried.

52
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:39,403
Well, have fun.
I'm off to stick my head in the oven.

53
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:41,049
[LAUGHTER]

54
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:46,289
Hello? Marshall?

55
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:48,918
Yeah, I got rid of them.

56
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:53,049
You bring some wine,
and I'll throw the steaks on.

57
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:00,768
[RESTAURANT CHATTER]

58
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:05,082
Oh, dear Lord, it's rather busy.
Well, let's keep our fingers crossed.

59
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:07,924
- Francois!
- Dr Crane, <i>bonsoir!</i>

60
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:09,239
<i>Bonsoir.</i>

61
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:11,725
- <i>Bonsoir.</i>
- <i>Bonsoir.</i>

62
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:13,438
This is our father, Martin Crane.

63
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:15,959
- <i>Monsieur Crane!</i>
- How you doing?

64
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:17,883
<i>Enchante.</i>

65
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:20,361
Francois, I'm afraid we're
at your mercy tonight.

66
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:22,122
You see, we have no reservations.

67
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:26,087
- Dr Crane, I will see what I can do.
- Thank you.

68
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:27,888
Anything would be just fine.
Thank you.

69
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:29,284
You know, come to think of it,

70
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:33,125
we haven't been here since Chef
Joachim had his pinkie grafted back on.

71
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:36,845
Oh, then this is your first time
seeing our new artwork.

72
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:38,849
He's my own discovery.

73
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:40,563
His name is Cordoba.

74
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:42,806
- Exquisite!
- Stunning!

75
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:47,083
My God, I don't think I've ever seen
such fearless use of colour.

76
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:52,000
You know, as usual, your taste
is as fine as your cuisine. Any luck?

77
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:56,328
For you, yes. For Dr Dubin,
who brings his own wine, no.

78
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:58,687
- Good man!
- <i>Monsieur,</i> follow me, please.

79
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:00,681
- <i>Merci bien.</i>
- Your table is ready.

80
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:02,169
- Thank you.
- You guys go ahead.

81
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:06,084
I gotta make a little visit to <i>"le</i> can."

82
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,047
- That's our father.
- Doctor.

83
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:10,280
- <i>Le menu.</i>
- <i>Merci.</i>

84
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:13,328
- I will be back with the wine list.
- Lovely.

85
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:14,759
Wine list?

86
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,166
My God, he ought
to bring us blindfolds.

87
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:20,328
I mean, what is he thinking
with this artwork?

88
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:21,525
It's appalling.

89
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:23,368
Who was it that said,
"Art in restaurants

90
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:25,600
is on the same level with food
in museums"?

91
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:29,608
The little white lies one will tell
for a good table, huh?

92
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:32,239
Of course, I would compliment
a black velvet Elvis right now

93
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:35,368
if Chef Joachim's lobster comfit
were at stake.

94
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,966
Frasier, that's Winship Cook.

95
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:41,405
She's one of the guests Maris and I
are competing over.

96
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:42,885
I'm going to go woo her.

97
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:45,803
Oh, really, Niles, why don't you
just reschedule your party?

98
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:48,968
I don't want to give her the satisfaction.
She's pushed me around long enough.

99
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:50,398
- All right.
- Metaphorically.

100
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:53,044
In reality, she can hardly push at all.

101
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,724
Hence, that terrible afternoon
last spring she spent trapped

102
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:57,562
in the revolving door at Bergdorf's.

103
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:03,086
I hope there's something on there you
like because dinner's on me tonight.

104
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,968
- What do you mean, Dad?
- We had an agreement.

105
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:08,167
- Next time we went out, it's my treat.
- Well, Dad, when I said that...

106
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:10,725
- Hup, We're not discussing it.
- Yes, but Dad, it's rather pricey.

107
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:12,721
- Hup, you promised.
- Well, l... I just don't...

108
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:15,529
- Hup!
- All right. All right. You treat.

109
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,328
Thank you.
Now, don't worry about it.

110
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:19,720
Just order whatever you want.

111
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:25,405
Is this per person?

112
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:27,522
The wine list, uh, doctor.

113
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:30,079
Thank you. Thank you, Francois,
but, you know what,

114
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,763
we won't be having any wine tonight.

115
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:35,280
And I'm going out for
a Big Mac after work.

116
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:37,084
No, I'm really being quite serious.

117
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,810
You see, my brother and I are
watching our caloric intake tonight.

118
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:41,039
We'll be eating light.

119
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:43,687
As you wish, doctor.

120
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:46,841
I know what you're doing.
I'm not stupid.

121
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:48,688
- What are you talking about?
- Eating light?

122
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,801
All the way here you had the look
that Eddie gets

123
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:53,040
when he hears a can-opener.

124
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:56,358
Look, Dad, it's just that I'm not
that comfortable ordering

125
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:58,327
an expensive meal
when you're paying.

126
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:00,839
What's the big deal?
You take me to places like this.

127
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:02,728
I can afford it!

128
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:05,045
I'm sorry.

129
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,605
I didn't mean that the way
it sounded.

130
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:09,965
- I know how you feel.
- No, you don't.

131
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:12,246
You're always paying,
and I'm never allowed to pay.

132
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:13,604
Well, it feels pretty lousy.

133
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:16,689
- Go ahead, Mr Big Shot, you pay.
- Dad...

134
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:20,206
Well, the good news is Winship
has agreed to come to my party.

135
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:23,846
Bad news is I left my wallet at home,
so, Frasier, I'm afraid this is on you.

136
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:27,201
- Actually, tonight's dinner is on Dad.
- No, you ruined it. I'm not paying.

137
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:30,004
- Well, I'm not paying!
- Well, I can't pay.

138
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:35,085
So that would be three
Happy Meals to go?

139
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:40,883
No, he never suspected a thing.

140
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:44,087
Yes, I had a great time too.

141
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,400
Oh, go on, Marshall, say it again.

142
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:52,398
Now say it how you said it last night,
like Donald Duck.

143
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:56,769
Well, I guess it was the wine
that made it funny.

144
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:59,121
They're back.
Yeah, I'll see you tonight.

145
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:00,769
Bye.

146
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:02,528
- Hello.
- FRASIER: Oh, hello, Daphne.

147
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:04,721
Will you be favouring us with
any English delicacies?

148
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:06,403
Well, as a matter of fact, yes.

149
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:10,922
The butcher had some lovely calf
stomachs, so I'll try my hand at haggis.

150

Dad?

301
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:50,767
Are you sure Niles didn't
just hurt your feelings now?

302
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:54,406
No. I'm glad he told me. I don't wanna
give him something he doesn't like.

303
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:56,841
That's very wise.

304
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:59,922
You know, it's important for fathers
and sons to be honest with each other.

305
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:01,443
It shows respect.

306
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:05,209
You know, I've been thinking, Dad,
about the painting.

307
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:07,844
You know, art,
it's such a personal thing.

308
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:09,602
What one person may like,
another may not.

309
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:12,159
It doesn't mean that one is right
and the other is wrong.

You telling me
you don't like the painting?

311
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:17,288
Well, it's not that I don't like it,
it's just I don't love it.

312
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:18,644
It's not me.

313
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:21,761
Not a problem. You don't like it,
I'll take it back.

314
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:24,046
Oh, thank God, Dad, thank you.
That's such a relief.

315
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:27,566
You know, I was up half the night
worried about it, and I just...

316
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:30,238
Dad, are you all right?

317
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:33,126
Well, I didn't upset you, did I?

318
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:35,609
My God, Dad, are you crying?

319
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:36,959
No, no.

Yes, you are! Yes, you are!
I just saw you wipe your eyes.

No, I didn't. I just...

Oh, my God!

- Now, don't you start!

Oh, God, I'm only crying
because you're crying.

I'm not crying!
I don't know what this is.

327
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:56,965
I didn't even cry when I got shot.

328
00:15:57,450 --> 00:16:00,328
I didn't cry when you got shot, either.

the waiter you loved it so much.

- but you can't lie to me?!
- Please, please stop crying.

- No, it's no good.

No, no, it is good. It's very good.

Oh, my God, you're crying too.

You know how I get when other
people cry. Tell me what happened.

00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:42,403
I made our father cry.

Don't you think we ought to talk about

Nothing happened this afternoon.

Look, Dad,

353
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:15,520
I know you're disappointed
about the painting.

354
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:16,679
It's not a problem.

355
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:19,205
Well, look, you said yourself
that it wasn't as easy for you

to give me things as it was
when I was a kid.

I wasn't very good at it then either.

358

Your mother always picked
all your stuff out.

359

Still, you did put a roof over my head,
sent me to school...

All right, all right.
You wanna talk about this?

We'll talk about it.

Do people come to you
after they've met me and say,

"How can that guy be your father,
he's nothing like you"?

Well...

365
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:50,844
Because they've been saying that
to me about you for the last 40 years.

366
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:54,443
I just thought,

00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:56,487
I don't know,

368
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:58,641
that I'd finally given you something,

369
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:01,239
something you liked,
something we both liked.

370
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:04,929
Like we had something
in common or something.

Dad, Dad, just hang on a second,
will you?

373
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:16,079
Do you remember a time when I was,

374
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:20,209
oh, 6 or 7 years old?
You were getting ready for work,

375
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:25,524
and you were getting dressed,
and I was playing with your badge?

376
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:30,166
And you sat me down and you said
that it was not a toy.

377
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:34,880
That it was a symbol of something
very important...

378
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:40,005
...of integrity and honesty
and helping people.

379
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:47,089
Well, from then on, every time I'd see
you put on that badge, I would,

380
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,286
I would think of that.

381
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:55,047
I said it so you'd stop playing with
the thing. You were getting it all sticky.

Yeah, well,

00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:59,404
be that as it may.

384

and help other people.

I've tried as a psychiatrist

387
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:15,482
to conduct myself with the integrity
that you showed as a police officer.

388
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:19,929
And when I find myself in a quandary
as to the proper course of action,

389
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:24,005
I think of you wearing that badge,

390
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:28,084
and then I know what I have to do.

391
