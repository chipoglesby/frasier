- Hello, Frasier.
- Niles.

3

- Maureen.
- Hi, Niles.

4
00:00:16,762 --> 00:00:18,593
A, uh, nonfat cap, please.

5
00:00:18,762 --> 00:00:21,674
- I'll pay for his too.
- Well, thank you.

6
00:00:21,842 --> 00:00:24,436
My day started off with good news,
and it's already getting better.

7
00:00:24,602 --> 00:00:25,921
To what do I owe this largesse?

8
00:00:26,122 --> 00:00:27,953
Well, I'm having
a pretty great day too.

9
00:00:28,122 --> 00:00:30,431
See, a few months ago,
I took my first tennis lesson...

10
00:00:30,602 --> 00:00:33,162
And you've finally
mastered the backhand.

11
00:00:33,362 --> 00:00:35,239
No, I haven't played since.

12
00:00:35,402 --> 00:00:36,835
But the guy who was teaching me...

13
00:00:37,002 --> 00:00:39,118
Has won your girlish heart.

14
00:00:39,282 --> 00:00:40,397
No, he was a loser.

15
00:00:40,562 --> 00:00:43,201
But that day, he hit me this
little dink shot,

16
00:00:43,362 --> 00:00:45,034
and I ran for it,
and I stubbed my toe.

17
00:00:45,202 --> 00:00:48,512
I got this big black toenail
that lasted for, like, three months,

18
00:00:48,682 --> 00:00:50,320
and today it finally fell off.

19
00:00:52,522 --> 00:00:53,841
I can wear sandals again.

20
00:00:56,642 --> 00:00:58,360
- Thanks, Frasier.
- Goodbye, Maureen.

21
00:00:58,522 --> 00:00:59,750
- And good luck.
- Thanks.

22
00:01:01,162 --> 00:01:05,075
- Frasier, may I borrow your spoon?
- Certainly.

23
00:01:05,762 --> 00:01:07,718
I have an announcement.

24
00:01:08,242 --> 00:01:09,641
You know, frankly, so do I.

25
00:01:09,802 --> 00:01:12,396
Dad's girlfriend just told me
some very big news.

26
00:01:12,562 --> 00:01:14,314
Well, unless she's expecting
our baby brother,

27
00:01:14,482 --> 00:01:16,279
my news takes precedence.

28

- She's not, is she?
- No, no.

29

Mariott Fassbinder Award

30
00:01:23,322 --> 00:01:25,756
for Distinguished Contribution
to the Literature of Psychiatry.

31
00:01:25,922 --> 00:01:28,231
Judging from the canary feathers
protruding from your mouth,

32
00:01:28,402 --> 00:01:29,517
- I'd say you.
- Yes.

33
00:01:30,482 --> 00:01:31,631
What article did you win for?

34
00:01:31,802 --> 00:01:34,521
A gripping case history
of a narcissistic opera singer.

35
00:01:34,682 --> 00:01:36,832
I called it, "Me Me Me Me Me."

36
00:01:37,002 --> 00:01:40,597
- It's very clever. I like that.
- Yes.

37
00:01:41,562 --> 00:01:44,713
Thrilled as I am, I must admit I'm a tad
nervous about the awards banquet.

38
00:01:44,922 --> 00:01:46,958
- Why?
- Dad.

39
00:01:47,162 --> 00:01:48,720
I want him there, of course,

40
00:01:48,882 --> 00:01:51,112
but I'm just dreading a rerun
of Aunt Vi's wedding.

41
00:01:51,282 --> 00:01:54,831
Yes, the hour he spent regaling
the table with "Little Niles" stories.

42
00:01:55,002 --> 00:01:56,230
Exactly.

43
00:01:56,402 --> 00:01:58,358
Imagine an entire roomful
of trained psychiatrists

44

hearing the story of Sheldon,
my imaginary protëgë.

Oh, yes, Sheldon.

46
00:02:04,442 --> 00:02:07,354
That troubled little fellow
who kept wetting your bed.

47
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:11,874
Well, you know, if you're thinking
of excluding Dad from the event,

48
00:02:12,042 --> 00:02:13,760
your timing couldn't be worse.

49
00:02:13,922 --> 00:02:15,116
It's his birthday this weekend.

50
00:02:15,322 --> 00:02:16,880
Oh, right.

51
00:02:17,082 --> 00:02:19,073
On top of that,
Maureen just told me

52
00:02:19,242 --> 00:02:21,153
that she's decided
to break it off with him.

53

Oh, dear. What?

Is it the age difference?

56
00:02:26,802 --> 00:02:28,599
No, no, she was quite emphatic
on that point.

57
00:02:28,762 --> 00:02:30,514
She just thinks they have
nothing in common.

58
00:02:30,682 --> 00:02:33,321
Oh, poor Dad. I know how much
he enjoyed going out with her.

59
00:02:33,482 --> 00:02:34,915
Yes, just the other day
he was saying

60
00:02:35,082 --> 00:02:37,198
that between her police badge
and his handicap sticker,

61
00:02:37,362 --> 00:02:39,080
they could park anywhere.

- Dad and Maureen are on a date.

65
00:02:51,202 --> 00:02:54,000
It's not going well. She's telling him
that she wants to break it off.

Oh, this vision you're getting,

67
00:02:56,442 --> 00:02:58,637
is it a tingly feeling
and a picture in your head,

68
00:02:58,802 --> 00:03:01,999
or more like a husky voice
murmuring in your ear?

69

It's not a vision.

Maureen told me about this
this afternoon.

71
00:03:06,442 --> 00:03:08,876
Just worried about Dad.
We have to help him through this.

I wouldn't worry about your father.

You know, when Joe dumped me
a few weeks ago,

75
00:03:15,882 --> 00:03:17,634
I thought I'd lost the love of me life.

76

I figured I'd spend the rest of my years
dwelling on what might have been.

77
00:03:21,642 --> 00:03:24,475

Yeah, it does.

this has nothing to do with your age.

You see...

...she wanted to make it
perfectly clear

108

that her breaking up with you
had nothing to do with your age,

00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:17,513
You made her believe
that she'd broken your heart.

160
00:07:17,682 --> 00:07:18,671
Well, of course I did.

161
00:07:18,842 --> 00:07:21,595
When a woman breaks up with you,
you have to act sad. It's only polite.

162
00:07:21,762 --> 00:07:23,195
Polite?

163
00:07:23,362 --> 00:07:25,922
My God, Dad, guilt is
a very destructive emotion.

164
00:07:26,082 --> 00:07:27,913
Spare me the lvy League bull.

165
00:07:28,082 --> 00:07:30,676
There ain't a dame alive who wouldn't
rather break a guy's heart

166
00:07:30,842 --> 00:07:32,594
than think she hadn't
even made a dent in it.

167
00:07:32,762 --> 00:07:36,471
I may not have been to Harvard,
but I have been to the college of love.

168
00:07:37,322 --> 00:07:40,678
Apparently on a Spillane Fellowship.

169
00:07:43,562 --> 00:07:45,314
- DAPHNE: Hello, Dr Crane.
- NILES: Hey, Daphne.

00:07:45,482 --> 00:07:47,473
- FRASIER: Hello, Niles.
- NILES: Where's the birthday boy?

171
00:07:47,642 --> 00:07:49,712
He's getting all dolled up
for his lady friend.

172
00:07:49,882 --> 00:07:51,520
You should see how excited he is.

173
00:07:51,682 --> 00:07:54,116
Not half as excited as he's going to be
when he sees these new videos.

174
00:07:54,282 --> 00:07:56,159
Twelve cassettes of the history
of World War II.

175
00:07:56,522 --> 00:07:59,594
For those who thought the original
was fun but too short.

176
00:08:00,842 --> 00:08:03,356
This year I thought, "What the hell,
give him something he wants

177
00:08:03,522 --> 00:08:04,841
instead of what I think he needs."

178
00:08:05,002 --> 00:08:07,152
- Very commendable sentiment.
- What did you get him?

179
00:08:07,322 --> 00:08:09,199
An Armani tux.

180
00:08:10,322 --> 00:08:11,914
Well, my banquet's coming up.

- Don't you look dapper?
- Well, thanks.

183
00:08:17,602 --> 00:08:20,036
Yeah, I heard the door.
I thought maybe it was Sherry.

184
00:08:20,442 --> 00:08:22,876
I thought we were joining her
and your chums at the restaurant.

185
00:08:23,042 --> 00:08:24,031
Yeah, I changed my mind.

186
00:08:24,202 --> 00:08:27,000
You know, I just thought that...
I'm just so anxious for you to meet her.

187
00:08:27,162 --> 00:08:29,517
I know you're gonna love her.
No. Forget I said that.

188
00:08:29,682 --> 00:08:32,150
I mean, you will,
but I just don't wanna jinx it.

No, wait, I'll get it.

Happy birthday.

Come on in and meet the family.

Hi. Sherry Dempsey.

195
00:08:52,002 --> 00:08:55,995
Now, Marty didn't tell me
the two of you were so handsome.

196
00:08:56,722 --> 00:08:58,394
Hello. Daphne Moon.

197
00:08:58,602 --> 00:09:00,911
Oh, the physical therapist.

198
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:03,152
- Right.
- Don't worry about me, honey.

199
00:09:03,322 --> 00:09:04,550
I'm not the jealous type.

Anybody that keeps my Marty limber
is aces in my book.

- Hey, sit down, Sherry. Come on.
- Okay.

202

You know, Fras,
Sherry's a big fan of your show.

203
00:09:14,682 --> 00:09:16,001
Oh, yes, a big fan.

204
00:09:16,162 --> 00:09:18,392
Well, as a matter of fact,
when my friend Donna's marriage

205
00:09:18,562 --> 00:09:21,030
was on the rocks, you were the one
that she called for advice.

206
00:09:21,202 --> 00:09:23,193
Really? And did my advice
prove helpful?

207
00:09:23,682 --> 00:09:25,434
That's not important.

208
00:09:25,602 --> 00:09:28,833
- You cared. That's what matters.
- Can we offer you a drink?

209
00:09:29,042 --> 00:09:33,479
Well, actually, since it's a special
occasion, I brought some bubbly.

210
00:09:33,642 --> 00:09:35,758
- Let's crack it open.
- Well.

211
00:09:36,802 --> 00:09:39,236
Yes, why not?

Oh, look, Frasier, Cold Duck.

- You ever had it?
- Just once.

00:09:46,402 --> 00:09:48,199
- I'll do the honours.
- Thank you.

215

Oh, I love this apartment.

- Wow, that's some view you've got.
- FRASIER: Thank you.

Which room's mine?

00:09:57,842 --> 00:09:59,434
Gotcha.

219

She's always doing stuff like that.

220
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:04,993
Oh, I love making people laugh.

221
00:10:05,162 --> 00:10:07,437
To me, humour is like medicine.

222
00:10:07,602 --> 00:10:09,991
Guess we're in the placebo group.

223

So, um...

224
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:19,831
Dad tells me that you, you two kids
met at McGinty's.

That's right. I tend bar there.

Saw your dad there one night
looking kind of lonesome,

- Bottoms up.

- Yes.
- Through the lips and over the gums...

241
00:10:58,762 --> 00:11:01,151
Yeah, you know,
Sherry used to be on stage.

242
00:11:01,322 --> 00:11:02,596
On Broadway?

243
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:04,275
Las Vegas. Ever been there?

00:11:04,442 --> 00:11:06,273
Just once.

What a town, huh?
Great food, terrific theatre.

246
00:11:10,442 --> 00:11:12,160
Just too darn easy to get married.

- You're separated, right?
- Yes.

- Listen, you want my advice?
- Well...

Don't mope.

Well, Mama had lots

The last several about a well-travelled

Oh, no.

Oh, wow, what a cute place this is.

Yeah, well, the boys love it here.

297
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:42,518
We should start coming here.
Make room at that table.

298

We'll be right back.
We're gonna get a cuppa.

299

Quick, Niles, pull up the ladder.

300

- She found our clubhouse.
- Oh.

This can not go on.

302
00:13:53,962 --> 00:13:55,315
You're right.

303
00:13:55,482 --> 00:13:57,120
Dad has to be politely told that

304
00:13:57,282 --> 00:13:58,715
even though he may
enjoy her company,

305
00:13:58,882 --> 00:14:01,715
he has no right to...
What's a polite word for "inflict"?

I don't know,
but I'm sure you'll find one.

Me? You mean I have to
do this alone?

I thought the two of us
would sit down and talk to him...

309

No, no, no, no.
I'm afraid you're the one

who's going to be making
that little speech.

311
00:14:12,562 --> 00:14:13,597
