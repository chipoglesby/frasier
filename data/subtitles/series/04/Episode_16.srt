1
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:12,907
My 8-year-old son is visiting me
this week, and he asked specifically

2
00:00:13,221 --> 00:00:15,815
if I could arrange a tour
of the Microsoft complex.

3
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:18,336
I was wondering
what your policy is on--

4
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:20,478
I'm sorry to hear that.

5
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:23,209
You know, I don't often trade
on my celebrity status,

6
00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:26,791
but does the name Frasier Crane
mean anything to you?

7
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:29,521
I'm sorry to hear that.

8
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:32,430
Well, you know, it's entirely possible

9
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:36,328
that one day a relative of yours
may wish to tour my workplace--

10
00:00:36,661 --> 00:00:40,336
It's a radio station. Oh, forget it!

11
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:42,584
--even been close,
that would be one thing.

12
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:46,144
- But I beat that tag by a mile. A mile.
- Calm down, slugger. It's all right.

13
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:48,340
- A mile!
- I take it you lost the game.

14
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,502
No, we won the game, but Roz got
kicked out for arguing with the ump.

15
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:54,235
She kicked dirt on his shoes,
chest-butted him,

16
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:57,148
almost took a bite out of his finger
when he stuck it in her face.

17
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:59,942
You can't coach that kind of thing.

18
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:05,209
All right, there's a guy on second,
one guy's out, I drive one to the gap.

19
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:07,635
The throw to the cut-off man
is late, our guy's safe,

20
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:11,371
I try to stretch it to a double. I make a
beautiful hook slide right under the tag.

21
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:12,685
How can I be out?

22
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:16,337
I'm still trying to understand why
you drove to the Gap during the game.

23
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:21,392
Look, I'm gonna go work
on the line-up for Saturday's game.

24
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:24,576
- You know, I love being in charge.
- Oh, can I play second base?

25
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:26,229
No. Liz Budner's playing second.

26
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:29,339
Liz Budner? Why?
What can she do that I can't?

27
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:32,062
It's what she will do that you won't.

28
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:38,754
Oh, Roz. Listen, didn't you used
to date some executive at Microsoft?

29
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,897
Scott Blankman.

30
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:43,781
Talk about your messy break-ups.

31
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,534
Even after I dumped the guy,
he kept calling me.

32
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:47,971
At first, he'd make excuses:

33
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:50,102
"Sorry, I hit the wrong button
on my speed dial."

34
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,430
Then he gave up the pretense
and there'd be sobbing

35
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:54,448
- on the other end of the line.
- Oh, God.

36
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:58,532
I finally said, "Scott, I never, ever
want to talk to you again."

37
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:01,143
- Why do you ask?
- I'd like you give him a call.

38
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,866
- What?
- Frederick's coming to visit this week.

39
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,240
The only thing he asked for
was a tour of Microsoft.

40
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:09,618
I sort of already, well,
promised that I could arrange it.

41
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:11,832
Frasier, you're asking me
to call a man

42
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,001
who camped outside
my apartment building

43
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:15,578
and held a big sign up that said:

44
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:18,714
- "Roz Doyle is afraid to love."
- Okay, I understand.

45
00:02:19,014 --> 00:02:21,130
I just thought you'd be
more sympathetic, that's all.

46
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:22,665
I can't.

47
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:26,043
I do recall a story
you told me not long ago

48
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:29,790
about a young girl living in Wisconsin,
who wanted desperately for her mother

49
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:33,305
to drive her to Chicago to see
Bobby Sherman open a shopping mall.

50
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,463
But her mother was just too busy.

51
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,014
What did that girl do that night?

52
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:41,472
She cried herself to sleep
on her little Bobby Sherman pillow.

53
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:45,654
I hate you.

54
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:54,283
- Niles.
- Good morning. Is Frederick up yet?

55
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:57,017
He went out with his grandfather
for an early morning walk.

56
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:59,133
I went through
my old albums this morning

57
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:01,378
and found photos of us
when we were Frederick's age.

58
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:03,709
- Oh, Lord.
- Thought he might find them amusing.

59
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:08,253
Oh, here. There we are, all dressed up,
ready for our first Cub Scout hike.

60
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:09,640
And last.

61
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:13,326
Yes, well, we didn't exactly
endear ourselves to the pack.

62
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:14,925
All the other kids had knapsacks,

63
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:17,986
we showed up with those
monogrammed train cases.

64
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,959
Niles, refresh my memory.
Why are we wearing plastic snouts

65
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:24,199
and a tiny little wading pool
around our waists?

66
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:26,805
You've forgotten. That Halloween
we went as the Bay of Pigs.

67
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:28,401
Ah.

68
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:31,309
As I recall, nobody got it.

69
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:35,545
I finally had to take to telling
that we were <i>Swine Lake</i>.

70
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,474
They didn't get that either.

71
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:41,198
- That was a long evening.
- Yeah.

72
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:43,951
So, what do you have in store
for Frederick this visit?

73
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,215
We're gonna go whale-watching,
the planetarium,

74
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:48,751
and Roz is helping me
arrange a tour of Microsoft.

75
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,931
It's the one thing Freddie
specifically requested.

76
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,744
Someone's running for
Dad of the Year.

77
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:54,616
Yes, well, you know how it is.

78
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:56,531
I don't get to see him
as often as I'd like.

79
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:59,895
Memories of this trip
will have to last until the next one.

80
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,515
Can you blame me
for wanting it to be perfect?

81
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:04,737
- Hi, Dad.
- Oh, hello, Freddie.

82
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:07,462
Dad, did Grandpa ever tell you
the story how he captured

83
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,897
four bank robbers
with just a nightstick?

84
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,324
No. He did tell me how
he captured two bank robbers

85
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:15,304
with just a revolver,
his partner and a SWAT team.

86
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,427
- They got there later.
- Well...

87
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:19,904
- Hello, Uncle Niles.
- Hello, Frederick.

88
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:22,451
My, aren't you getting big.

89
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:25,720
I'm the same exact size I was
the last time you saw me.

90
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:30,096
Well, your mother's cooking
will do that for a growing boy.

91
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,466
- Are we going to Microsoft today?
- Well, Freddie,

92
00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:36,530
I thought we'd go by the radio station.
I could show you where I work.

93
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:38,376
- That'll be fun, won't it?
- Yes.

94
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:41,842
- When are we going to Microsoft?
- Well, Saturday.

95
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:43,431
Excellent.

96
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,373
- Hey, good morning, Dr. Crane.
- Good morning, Daphne.

97
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:50,378
- Hi, Daphne.
- Hello, Frederick.

98
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,902
Tell your dad what you saw
in the park with Eddie.

99
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:55,882
Hi, Daphne.

100
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:59,602
- Frederick's my boyfriend.
- Oh, really.

101
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:02,916
I got a present for you. Wait here.

102
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:05,581
That's so cute.
He's got a crush on you.

103
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:09,999
Yes, he spent the entire evening
sitting on Daphne's lap, watching TV.

104
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:12,899
Really.

105
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:17,578
And this morning I heard
this soft little knocking at my door,

106
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:22,091
and it was Frederick, asking if
he could climb into bed with me.

107
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:24,244
Really.

108
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:29,629
- It's for you.
- Oh, well, isn't this lovely.

109
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:32,787
Look, here's Frederick.
And here I am.

110
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,836
- And what are we doing?
- Getting married.

111
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,827
Really.

112
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:42,353
Come on, Frederick,
let's go hang this on the fridge.

113
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:43,987
Okay.

114
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:46,475
Do you think it's healthy
for a little boy

115
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:49,482
to be so obsessed with a woman
he can't possibly have?

116
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:52,880
Niles, have you actually sunk
so low as to be jealous of him?

117
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:55,594
No, I'm not jealous. I'm just a bit--

118
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:58,289
Well, maybe envious.

119
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:01,292
That's ridiculous. What have
you got to be envious of?

120
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:04,842
- Hold on!
- Wee!

121
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:09,937
Wee!

122
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:19,515
And this is the booth
where it all happens.

123
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:22,356
- Very impressive.
- Well...

124
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:25,863
This is the talkback button here,
if I want to talk to Roz,

125
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:28,008
the cough button
if I want to mute the mike.

126
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:30,413
This button here is very special.
It sends a death ray

127
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:33,321
shooting from the phone
of any caller who annoys me.

128
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:35,532
You wish.

129
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:37,738
Yes, I do.

130
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:40,541
Well, okay, Roz, what have
we done to ourselves today?

131
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:43,206
Well, we went out last night
to celebrate our big win.

132
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:45,041
- Ah.
- Had a few margaritas.

133
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,919
Someone started a conga line.
I wasn't gonna get in it.

134
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:50,554
I think Gary, our shortstop,
got on the end of the line.

135
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:54,066
That man has a butt that makes you
wanna reach out with both hands

136
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:57,531
and give Freddie
a great big Seattle hug.

137
00:06:58,126 --> 00:06:59,559
- Good save, Roz.
- Thank you.

138
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:01,785
- I don't believe you've met Bulldog.
- Hey, kid.

139
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:05,763
- Why are you called Bulldog?
- People just always call me that.

140
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,923
But why?

141
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:10,604
- I don't know.
- Well, all right, Bulldog.

142
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,361
- Roz and I have a show to prepare for.
- No, no. Wait a minute.

143
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:16,519
This is important.
Why do people call me Bulldog?

144
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:17,800
There has to be a reason.

145
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:22,791
This is gonna drive me nuts.

146
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,112
Who's subbing for me
in Saturday's game?

147
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:27,318
We gotta have a ninth body
out there or we forfeit.

148
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:31,163
- Oh, right. How about Mindy Guthrie?
- Eight months pregnant.

149
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:35,990
July, August, September, October,
November, December...

150
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:42,626
Anyway, you better find somebody.
And speaking of bad news, Frasier,

151
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:44,513
I finally got a call
from Scott Blankman--

152
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:46,667
Roz... Frederick,
talk with Bulldog for a minute.

153
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:49,155
- I have to discuss something with Roz.
- Okay.

154
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,983
Oh, yeah, no problem.

155
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,829
Oh, hey. In a little while
I'm gonna bring in my cart.

156
00:07:57,102 --> 00:07:59,775
- You can hit the gong.
- Why?

157
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:03,320
It's loud. I make a lot
of loud noises in my show.

158
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,845
- Why?
- I don't know.

159
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:08,261
Boy, I'm starting to get a headache.

160
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:11,165
If you need a softball player,
why don't you use my dad.

161
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,243
Oh, yeah, right.

162
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,343
Isn't he good?

163
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:19,924
Oh, yeah. Yeah, he's great.
He is the best, you know.

164
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:23,083
I wish he could play, but I think
your dad's busy Saturday.

165
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:26,537
- He's taking me to Microsoft.
- Yeah, right.

166
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:30,549
Man, I wish he could play, because
if he were playing, we'd win for sure.

167
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:32,804
I'm sorry, Frasier. That's all I can do.

168
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:35,363
Scott quit Microsoft
right after we broke up.

169
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:38,416
Well, I don't look forward
to telling Frederick.

170
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:40,277
He'll be so disappointed.

171
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:43,952
Well, you know, if he wants a tour
of a seminary, I've got an in there now.

172
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:48,884
I don't know. I give up.

173
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:50,428
Abraham Lincoln.

174
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:53,727
What school did you go to?

175
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,479
Frederick...

176
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:59,979
Dad, I don't wanna go
to Microsoft anymore.

177
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:03,009
- You don't?
- Oh, hey. Yes, he does. Wait a minute.

178
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:05,523
What kind of boy wouldn't wanna
spend a day at Microsoft?

179
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:10,391
Stay out of this. Now, listen. Frederick,
you know, this is your vacation.

180
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:12,351
You are the boss.
Whatever you say goes.

181
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:15,468
Great. I wanna see you play
in the softball game.

182
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:18,358
- What?
- You could take Roz's place.

183
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:20,757
Well, you know, as much
as I'd love to play softball,

184
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:22,816
I really don't think
that Bulldog wants me to.

185
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:25,902
Yes, he does. He said
you were the best. Right?

186
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:28,500
That's what I said.

187
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:32,208
- Well, thank you, Bulldog.
- So you'll play?

188
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:36,087
- Well, I don't see how I can refuse.
- Great. I can't wait to tell Daphne.

189
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,923
Yes, well, speaking of Daphne,
while you're waiting for Daphne,

190
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:42,082
why don't you go on out, get yourself
a candy bar out of the machine.

191
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:44,092
Mother says candy rots
tooth enamel.

192
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:46,848
Yes, well, chew on the side
of your mouth. Rot your baby teeth.

193
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:51,099
What do you think you're doing,
telling him I'm a good softball player?

194
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,858
Trying to be nice. You want me
to tell him you're a big lame-o?

195
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:56,729
- No, I don't.
- Hey, look, I know how tough it is

196
00:09:57,013 --> 00:10:00,562
when you're a kid and you find out
your dad's not as great as you thought.

197
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:04,248
Look, I was about
Frederick's age when...

198
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:07,710
Well, I came home.
My mom was out

199
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:09,813
and I caught my dad
with another woman.

200
00:10:10,694 --> 00:10:13,572
- Oh, Bulldog, I'm sorry.
- No, no. No, wait.

201
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:16,138
You haven't heard the bad part yet.

202
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:19,141
She was ugly, doc.

203
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:23,290
I mean, coyote ugly. My own dad.

204
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:25,701
And the best excuse
he could come up with was:

205
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:29,634
"Hey, you don't look at the mantel
when you're poking the fire."

206
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:35,696
Hey! I just got that.

207
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:43,985
I just keep thinking back to that time
when Dad made us try Little League.

208
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,584
I'll never forget the humiliation

209
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:48,485
of getting up to bat
for the first time in my life,

210
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:50,968
hearing the other team all cry out:

211
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:54,544
"Move in, everybody. Crane's up."

212
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:57,839
But they moved back out again
after you took your first swing.

213
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:00,626
Only because the bat
flew out of my hands.

214
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:03,686
You worry too much.

215
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:06,347
Your co-workers aren't
expecting you to play brilliantly.

216
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:08,933
No, I can live with playing badly
in front of my co-workers.

217
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:11,243
It's Frederick I'm worried about.

218
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:14,098
He's still at that age where
he thinks his father can do anything.

219
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:16,460
Every child, at some point,
must discover

220
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:18,754
- that his father is not a superhero.
- I know.

221
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:21,048
It's a healthy part
of the developmental process.

222
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:23,900
I know someday he's gonna
have to learn that I'm not perfect.

223
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:26,652
It's just-- I was hoping it might be
something less humiliating,

224
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:30,087
like seeing me fast-dance
at a family wedding.

225
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:34,084
- You consider that less humiliating?
- Well...

226
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:36,317
Hello. Look who's here.

227
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:38,368
You two have fun
while I was at work?

228
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:40,367
- Yes.
- Oh, yes.

229
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:43,177
We went to the amusement park.
We had a lovely time.

230
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:45,603
Only, I think the Ferris wheel
scared him a bit.

231
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:48,944
He spent the whole ride
hugging me for dear life.

232
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:51,089
Really.

233
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:54,984
Her hair smells like strawberry.

234
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:58,457
It smells like peach blossoms,
lavender and vanilla.

235
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:02,548
From over here, at least.

236
00:12:03,598 --> 00:12:06,635
Uncle Niles, are you coming to watch
my dad play in the softball game?

237
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:09,733
- He's the best one on the team.
- Well, of course I am, Freddie.

238
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:12,899
I'll be there sitting
right between you and Daphne.

239
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:16,092
Well, come on, Frederick.
Let's go get some hot chocolate.

240
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:17,552
Okay.

241
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:20,691
- So you see the problem.
- I certainly do.

242
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,867
No, that's your problem.

243
00:12:23,618 --> 00:12:26,371
My problem is that I promised
Frederick I would play on Saturday.

244
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:28,096
Guess I'm left with only one choice.

245
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:30,250
- You're gonna fake an injury?
- No, course not.

246
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,775
- I've got to learn how to play softball.
- In two days?

247
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:35,000
Well, back in college,
when Stu Oberfeld got sick,

248
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:37,894
I learned the role of Mercutio
in a day and a half. I was brilliant.

249
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:41,049
In the dueling scene, the audience
was on the edge of their seats.

250
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:44,617
Yes, and they were under them when
the sword flew out of your hands.

251
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:54,096
Gee, Dad, I wanna thank
you for helping me out with this.

252
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,709
Don't mention it.
We're gonna whip you right into shape.

253
00:12:58,028 --> 00:12:59,302
It must have been disappointing

254
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:01,884
I never took any interest
in this sort of thing as a kid.

255
00:13:02,157 --> 00:13:03,510
Well, I understood.

256
00:13:03,742 --> 00:13:06,017
Guess it's a little complex
I must have developed

257
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:09,835
when I was growing up. The doorbell
would ring, I'd run to answer it,

258
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:13,915
and then there'd be the neighborhood
kids with their baseball gloves

259
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:17,491
and their bats, looking for
somebody else to join their game.

260
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:20,914
They'd say, "Hey, can your dad
come out and play?"

261
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:24,854
Well, never mind that. You know,
it's kind of fun to finally be out here.

262
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:30,576
At the risk of sounding like Stanley
cornering Blanche DuBois in <i>Streetcar</i>,

263
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:33,332
we've had this date with each other
from the very beginning.

264
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:35,118
I knew you'd ruin it.

265
00:13:35,357 --> 00:13:37,666
All right, come on.
Put your helmet on.

266
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:40,718
- Gee, it's kind of tight.
- Well, it's supposed to.

267
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:42,705
It stops you from getting hurt.

268
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:46,064
Okay? Here, all right. There you go.

269
00:13:46,368 --> 00:13:48,086
Now...

270
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:51,387
...take your bat, get into the stance,
just like I told you.

271
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:53,701
I'm gonna turn the machine on.

272
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:57,030
The good thing about these balls
is that they're all at the same level,

273
00:13:57,379 --> 00:14:00,177
so you can work on your form
and your timing. All right?

274
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:02,660
Okay, now, here we go.

275
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:05,015
Ah!

276
00:14:05,303 --> 00:14:08,420
What is that? A pitching machine
or a particle accelerator?

277
00:14:09,391 --> 00:14:12,463
All right, all right.
I'll crank it down to a lower setting.

278
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:14,441
Okay, now, just remember,

279
00:14:14,729 --> 00:14:18,438
left elbow in, right elbow up,
knees bent.

280
00:14:18,817 --> 00:14:20,648
All the weight on the balls
of your feet, okay?

281
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:23,860
Now, just step into the pitch.

282
00:14:25,407 --> 00:14:28,319
Oh, yeah, and swing the bat.

283
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,412
Dad, can't you just
slow it down a little bit?

284
00:14:30,662 --> 00:14:33,301
All right, but if any of the other
fathers come back here,

285
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:35,333
I'm taking it off the peewee setting.

286
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:38,059
Okay. All right. Now, from the hips.

287
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:40,255
Nice and easy. Don't try to kill it.

288
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:43,338
Just try to make contact.
Okay, you ready?

289
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:45,931
Ready.

290
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:52,498
What are you looking at?
Dad, they're looking at me.

291
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:54,208
Get out of here. Go on.

292
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:56,115
Buzz off!

293
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:08,321
Did you hear that?
Hear that? I touched it that time. I did.

294
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:11,013
No, it didn't.
That was my knee cracking.

295
00:15:11,286 --> 00:15:12,639
You're doing a lot better, though.

296
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:16,382
Six in a row without hitting yourself
in the kidney on your follow-through.

297
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,422
Who am I kidding? This is hopeless.

298
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:21,421
Oh, well. Well, why don't we
just try changing bats.

299
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:23,393
I couldn't hit it
if I had a sofa cushion.

300
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:27,465
All right, so softball's
not your game. It's no big deal.

301
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:31,397
- Freddie will understand that.
- I suppose in time he will.

302
00:15:31,723 --> 00:15:33,395
It's just that... Ow, ow, ow, ow.

303
00:15:37,062 --> 00:15:41,260
No boy ever forgets the first time
he learns that his dad isn't perfect.

304
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:44,786
It's not what I wanted him
to take away with him on this trip.

305
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:48,023
- Anyway, thanks for your help.
- Oh, don't mention it.

306
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:50,977
So, Frasier...

307
00:15:52,035 --> 00:15:53,866
- ...what was it for you?
- Huh?

308
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:55,595
Well, you know, I mean,

309
00:15:56,081 --> 00:15:59,391
when you first found out
that I was less than perfect.

310
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:01,574
I don't know.

311
00:16:01,836 --> 00:16:04,953
Well, I thought you said
a kid never forgets the first time.

312
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:07,770
- Maybe it was no one time.
- Oh, so it was a lot of times?

313
00:16:08,051 --> 00:16:10,007
No. I'm not very comfortable
talking about it--

314
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:12,737
Well, why? You're not gonna hurt
my feelings. I'm just curious.

315
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:14,648
All right, all right.

316
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:17,545
Back in third grade.

317
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:21,520
You took me and some of the boys
from the math club out for pizza.

318
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:25,511
When the check came...

319
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,500
...you couldn't figure out
the tip in your head.

320
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:32,257
I can't do math in my head?

321
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:35,484
- That's your big disappointment?
- Well, it was at the time.

322
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:38,821
Well, I wonder if I can calculate in my
head how many hits you got today.

323
00:16:39,124 --> 00:16:41,433
Let me think. Oh, zero!

324
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:44,178
Fine! Fine, Dad, get defensive.
I was 8 years old.

325
00:16:44,462 --> 00:16:46,930
Eight. That's the one shaped
like the snowman, right?

326
00:16:47,257 --> 00:16:49,373
I'm sorry I even brought it up. God.

327
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,778
Guess I'm gonna
have to bite the bullet,

328
00:16:54,014 --> 00:16:58,405
sit Frederick down on Saturday
before the game and tell him the truth.

329
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:03,879
Not a conversation I'm looking forward
to, but I should prepare him for the fact

330
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:08,411
his daddy's not gonna be hitting
any grand slams on Saturday.

331
00:17:10,572 --> 00:17:12,005
Or am I? Wait.

332
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,356
- A grand slam is...?
- You aren't.

333
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:20,491
Well, anyway, I suppose that
one consolation is, you know,

334
00:17:20,832 --> 00:17:23,107
as disappointed as I was
with you after the pizza incident,

335
00:17:23,418 --> 00:17:26,569
yet here we are, all these
years later, out in a batting cage.

336
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,348
Yeah, that's right. Come on,
I'll get us a couple of beers.

337
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:30,781
- Thanks, Dad.
- Okay.

338
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:34,046
And how many
of these shiny things--?

339
00:17:34,346 --> 00:17:36,382
Oh, shut up.

340
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:44,193
- Hello, Niles.
- You look like an authentic jock.

341
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:47,078
I'm half tempted to hand over
my lunch money.

342
00:17:47,776 --> 00:17:51,371
Is that your idea of appropriate
baseball-watching attire?

343
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:54,730
Obviously you failed to detect
the subtle diamond pattern in my tie.

344
00:17:55,033 --> 00:17:56,307
Oh.

345
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:02,563
So how did your little talk go
with Frederick?

346
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:06,461
Well, I haven't been able to
bring myself to do it yet.

347
00:18:06,795 --> 00:18:09,753
As a father, you go to any lengths to
avoid looking foolish before your son.

348
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:12,573
Look what Mrs. Thorgeson
was throwing out.

349
00:18:12,884 --> 00:18:16,081
Boy, the guys at McGinty's
are gonna love this.

350
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:23,209
Well, anyhow...

351
00:18:24,896 --> 00:18:26,932
What have I told you about
running in the house?

352
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:28,623
You told me to never run
in the house.

353
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:30,610
Good, and what about
splitting infinitives?

354
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,897
Frasier, let the boy be a boy.

355
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:35,797
Don't run away. I saw you.

356
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:38,626
Your son just walked right in
on me in the shower.

357
00:18:38,952 --> 00:18:40,783
- Frederick.
- Dad, all I really saw was--

358
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:42,675
I am very disappointed in you,
young man.

359
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:45,345
Let the boy finish.

360
00:18:51,131 --> 00:18:54,487
All I really saw was a lot of steam.

361
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:57,634
I'm sorry, Daphne.
I didn't know you were in the shower.

362
00:18:57,929 --> 00:19:00,318
- Now you hate me.
- I don't hate you.

363
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:04,716
You just have to promise to knock
before you enter a room, okay?

364
00:19:05,687 --> 00:19:08,804
- Sorry, Dad.
- That's okay, son.

365
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:11,583
So when are we going to the game?

366
00:19:12,444 --> 00:19:13,718
In a bit.

367
00:19:13,945 --> 00:19:16,618
First we have to have a little
conversation, the two of us.

368
00:19:16,948 --> 00:19:18,939
Uncle Niles, could you
give us a moment alone?

369
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,156
Oh, of course.
I'll freshen up for the game.

370
00:19:22,746 --> 00:19:26,102
You can fool them,
but you can't fool me.

371
00:19:28,418 --> 00:19:31,615
I'm onto you, little man.

372
00:19:37,802 --> 00:19:41,556
Come on, Freddie.
Come and have a seat here.

373
00:19:43,391 --> 00:19:45,143
Okay.

374
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:49,174
You're gonna see me play
some softball today.

375
00:19:49,981 --> 00:19:52,495
And I'm not gonna play very well.

376
00:19:53,443 --> 00:19:56,753
- See, I'm not a good softball player.
- But Bulldog said you were the best.

377
00:19:57,072 --> 00:20:01,384
Yes, I know. Well, he was
just lying in order to be nice.

378
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:03,710
The truth is I stink.

379
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:06,262
I can't catch, I can't throw, I can't hit.

380
00:20:06,623 --> 00:20:08,341
Oh.

381
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:12,269
So it must be pretty disappointing
to hear for the first time

382
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:15,935
- that your dad is not perfect, huh?
- It's not the first time.

383
00:20:18,093 --> 00:20:19,765
You couldn't fix my computer.

384
00:20:20,011 --> 00:20:22,923
You thought Venus
was the North Star.

385
00:20:23,264 --> 00:20:26,142
And I've seen you run.

386
00:20:29,354 --> 00:20:32,471
Well, why didn't you mention
any of these things to me before?

387
00:20:32,816 --> 00:20:35,967
I thought it might hurt
your self-esteem.

388
00:20:37,362 --> 00:20:40,434
Actually, Frederick, I'm really
okay with those things. I am.

389
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,334
I want you to know that it's okay
for you to feel bad about them.

390
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:46,860
See, when I was about your age,
I felt real bad about learning

391
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:49,199
that your grandpa
can't do math in his head.

392
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:51,846
I learned later, of course,
that that wasn't very important,

393
00:20:52,127 --> 00:20:54,038
because he can do
so many other things so well.

394
00:20:54,337 --> 00:20:58,376
- Grandpa can't do math in his head?
- Yes, well, see...

395
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:02,610
- That's not the issue.
- Why did you go and tell him that for?

396
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:06,243
- Well, I was illustrating a point.
- You mean, you can't do it at all?

397
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:09,511
- Well, yeah, sure I can, Freddie.
- I knew you could.

398
00:21:09,811 --> 00:21:12,166
What's seven times 15?

399
00:21:12,439 --> 00:21:14,714
You can do it, Grandpa.

400
00:21:15,525 --> 00:21:17,800
- 115?
- Oh, Grandpa.

401
00:21:18,069 --> 00:21:20,981
- Well, thanks a lot, Frasier.
- Well, I tried, for God's sake.

402
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:23,670
- Ready for the game?
- Yeah.

403
00:21:23,992 --> 00:21:25,345
You don't sound too excited.

404
00:21:25,577 --> 00:21:28,045
I just found out Dad's bad at softball

405
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:30,480
and Grandpa
can't do math in his head.

406
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:34,750
Those things aren't important.
What can I do to make you feel better?

407
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:38,120
- Maybe a hug?
- Oh, come here.

408
00:21:39,466 --> 00:21:42,617
Oh. There you go.
