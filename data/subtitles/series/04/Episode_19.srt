FRASIER: Morning, Sherry.

- Coffee's on. Want a cuppa?
FRASIER: No, thank you.

3
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:19,524
Caffeine only weakens the immune
system. I'm fighting off a flu.

Oh, I'm sorry.
Let me get you some breakfast.

- That's really not necessary.
SHERRY: No.

6
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,082
You'll feel much better
once you've had

7
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:28,048
my scrambled-egg tacos
and Spam patties.

"Starve a cold, disgust a fever."

- Oh, bless you.

- Oh, Marty loves fried foods.

16

Yes, well, just because
he likes something

17
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:03,963
doesn't mean it's good for him.

True. But just because
something's good for him

stuck with it day after day.

together. Just scurry to the car,

307
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,205
I'll only be a moment.

308
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:51,048
MARTIN:
Daphne.

309
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:54,043
Sherry and I talked,
and we really feel bad about this.

310
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,081
The whole thing is just
a misunderstanding.

311
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:59,965
If you want, I suppose we could
sit down and talk it out.

312
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:03,005
Well, I suppose we could.

313
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:06,407
NILES: Obviously, these two
wildcats can't come to terms.

314
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,922
The best thing will be
for them to be apart.

315
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:11,001
- I know. I'm a psychiatrist.
SHERRY: No, no, no.

316
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:14,520
Your dad is right.
Now, Daphne just misunderstood.

317
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:17,126
I didn't exactly misunderstand.

318
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:19,520
You did set me up
with a total stranger.

319
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:22,483
Oh, but he's not a stranger.
He comes in the bar all the time.

320
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:24,487
Oh, a barfly. Much better.

321
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:26,965
- Oh, there you go again.
- Me?!

322
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:29,041
You know, you two
are really a lot alike.

323
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:31,041
SHERRY: No, we're not!
- I am not like her!

324
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:33,929
SHERRY: How can you say that?
NILES: Talk amongst yourselves.

325
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:36,240
SHERRY:
I mean, all I was trying to do...

326
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:38,924
- He's probably an alcoholic!
- He is not an alcoholic.

327
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:41,399
You think I'd let you
go out with a...? Oh, honey...

328
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:43,083
DAPHNE:
A busybody, that's what you are.

329
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:44,239
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

330
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:45,763
MARTIN:
Frasier?

331
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:49,120
I'm taking a bath.

332
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:52,407
Bubbles?

333
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:54,367
They're aroma-therapeutic.

334
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:56,561
And exactly what part of
"I'm taking a bath"

335
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:58,960
did you take to mean "Come on in"?

336
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:01,764
Well, I'm sorry to tax your
delicate system, but Daphne's back,

337
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:03,727
and she and Sherry are at again,

338
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:06,006
and now she says she's gonna stay
overnight with Niles,

339
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:07,398
and this is your department.

340
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:10,368
Unless blood has been spilled,
and on a carpeted area, I don't care.

341
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:12,168
- Now get out.
SHERRY: Oh, there you are.

342
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:16,118
Marty, I tried, but that girl
has no manners whatsoever.

343
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:18,008
- Hey, Frasier.
- Do you mind?!

344
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:19,609
I knew I'd find you in here.

345
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:21,687
Whatever they're telling you,
it's not true.

346
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:24,489
- Daphne, you can't come in here.
- Why not? She can.

347
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:26,089
No, she can't! No one can!

348
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:28,042
Frasier, have you no decency?
Daphne, let's go.

349
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:31,128
All right, I am moments away from
succumbing once and for all to this flu,

350
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:35,448
but I will take one stab at this, and then
I am going to sink hippopotamus-like

351
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:36,963
beneath the bubbles.

352
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:41,286
I think what this all comes down to
is a dispute over turf.

353
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:44,169
Daphne and Sherry are like two
animals scent-marking their territory,

354
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:45,524
which in this case is you, Dad.

355
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:47,880
You couldn't come up with a less
disgusting comparison?

356
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:50,359
All right, fine. It's like the Roman
Emperor Tiberius.

357
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:52,441
His mother, Livia, and wife, Vipsania.

358
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:53,599
- What?
- Huh?

359
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:55,169
- Who?
- Go on.

360
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:57,278
FRASIER:
All right.

361
00:18:57,490 --> 00:19:01,927
Daphne, your primary role in this
household is to take care of Dad.

362
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:05,282
Sherry, you also enjoy
taking care of Dad.

363
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:09,363
I suspect that your attempts to find
Daphne a boyfriend are really

364
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:11,282
an unconscious ploy
to get her out of the way.

365
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:12,599
It's unconscious.

366
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:14,880
Daphne, actually,
you're threatened by this.

367
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:17,644
You feel that you're
no longer needed.

368
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:20,125
I have been feeling
a bit unwanted lately.

369
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:23,646
A night without your services will have
them singing a different tune. Let's go.

370
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:26,768
Yes, Niles, no one's gonna be singing
anything tonight, all right?

371
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:28,249
Daphne.

372
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:34,644
I think we now all understand why you
stormed out of here earlier.

373
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:38,286
A strong emotion like not feeling
wanted can drive anyone to a rash

374
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:39,724
and impulsive act.

375
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:41,522
Yes, it nearly did.

376
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:43,726
I mean, yes, it did.

377
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:46,364
Yes, well, at the root of this,

378
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:48,122
you're both just feeling insecure.

379
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:50,798
Exactly.

380
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:55,963
It very possibly could've been avoided
if Dad had been sensitive enough

381
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:58,200
to remind you that you're both
important in his life.

382
00:19:58,370 --> 00:19:59,962
What're you saying,
that it's my fault?

383
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:03,924
Well, I must admit, a few reassuring
words might just have done the trick.

384
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:06,485
Marty does have difficulty
expressing his feelings.

385
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:08,328
No, I don't.

386
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:10,368
- Oh, Sherry...
- Oh, save it, honey.

387
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:12,441
- It wasn't our fault.
- Yes, it was!

388
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:15,078
You said that she was skinny,
and you said she was a bigmouth.

389
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:16,763
That is not important.

390
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,762
- We all feel better now.
- Well, I don't.

391
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:21,046
Well, all right, look,
I am running out of patience.

392
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:23,678
I am running out of strength.
And I'm running out of bubbles.

393
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:26,919
Please, the lecture has ended!

394
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:31,399
- You're a good psychiatrist, Dr Crane.
- You sure are, hon.

395
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:34,886
You see, Marty?
It isn't just a lot of hooey.

396
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:37,247
- Thank you very much.
- Oh.

397
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:42,164
Please, Niles. Look, unconsciously,
you knew that it wasn't right.

398
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:43,968
That's why you brought
Daphne back here.

399
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:48,527
No, we came back to fetch
her damn thyroid pills.

400
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:51,642
You're a doctor. Why didn't you just
use your prescription pad?

401
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:58,845
Oh, my God.

402
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:02,766
Isn't there an all-night pharmacy
across the street from your building?

403
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:06,284
NILES:
Oh, my God.
