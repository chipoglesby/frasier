1
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:11,375
Hello? Yes, Buck, it's Dr. Crane.

2
00:00:11,636 --> 00:00:13,592
I'm calling to see if the cabin
is ready for us.

3
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:16,880
Uh, You got the case of Montrachet?
Good. Good.

4
00:00:17,183 --> 00:00:19,902
And the Thanksgiving feast
will be delivered promptly at 3?

5
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:24,225
Good. The woodpile's
been thoroughly inspected for spiders?

6
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:26,825
Excellent. Thank you.

7
00:00:27,068 --> 00:00:31,425
Well, we're ready to rough it
in the great Northwest.

8
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:34,273
If you don't mind my asking,
you taking anything along

9
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:37,412
- to keep your nephew amused?
- Yes, his grandfather.

10
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:41,522
Oh, by the way, what time tomorrow
are Frederick and Lilith flying in?

11
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:44,309
Her broom touches down at 11.

12
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:47,475
All right, now,
when you mist the plants,

13
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:50,831
be sure that the water is not too cold.
I know I'm harping on and on about this,

14
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:53,443
but I know you're not used to
dealing with delicate flowers.

15
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,359
I've produced your show
for three years, haven't I?

16
00:00:57,265 --> 00:01:00,098
I'll leave you a number at Niles' cabin
in case anything goes wrong.

17
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:02,869
Oh, yes, and by the way,
I frown on overnight guests.

18
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:05,577
Then you're not doing it right.

19
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:11,082
I'll leave you my number
in San Francisco too.

20
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:13,084
You're not going to the cabin
with them?

21
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:15,314
Daphne's decided to spend
a traditional Thanksgiving

22
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:18,612
with her transvestite uncle, Jackie.

23
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:21,285
Come on, Roz,
I'll show you around the kitchen.

24
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:24,451
So this uncle of yours, does he dress
like a woman all the time?

25
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:29,381
Oh, certainly not for work. His
congregation would never stand for it.

26
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:36,104
- What's wrong?
- Oh, just a little depressed.

27
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:38,348
This is my first Thanksgiving
without Maris.

28
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:40,714
Oh, yeah. I know, son, it's hard.

29
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:44,298
Remember the year I plopped
that big wedge of pumpkin pie

30
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:47,596
in front of her, and we all laughed?

31
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:50,625
Then I put a big scoop
of whipped cream on top of it,

32
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:52,972
and we laughed some more.

33
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:56,650
Then her eyes welled up with tears,
and we all knew it was time to stop.

34
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,906
Yes.

35
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:00,601
If it makes you feel any better,

36
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:03,024
I won't be having my dream
Thanksgiving either.

37
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:05,731
Why does Lilith
have to tag along anyway?

38
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:07,673
She didn't wanna spend
the holiday alone.

39
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:09,875
Her husband is in New Zealand,
exploring a volcano.

40
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:12,890
- Why couldn't she go with him?
- Because if she accidentally fell in,

41
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:15,768
the shock wave from the hottest thing
in nature meeting the coldest

42
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:18,247
would actually crack the Earth in two.

43
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:27,227
As if a smile from Maris
couldn't freeze Mercury.

44
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:30,597
Guys, let it go.
Nobody's gonna win this one.

45
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:36,053
Hello?

46
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:37,550
Yes, Lilith.

47
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:38,931
Yes, Lilith.

48
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:42,674
- Yes, Lilith.
- Gee, it's like they were still married.

49
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:46,075
If you change the paper towels,
he likes the flap facing the front.

50
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:48,683
If you change the bathroom tissue,
the flap faces the back.

51
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,518
Don't ask me why.

52
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:53,548
- Don't know how you live with him.
- Don't know how you work with him.

53
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,751
Well, I have learned a trick.

54
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:59,248
When he's really bugging me,
I ask if he hasn't lost a little weight.

55
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:01,465
Before you know it,
he's checking his butt out

56
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:03,361
in the glass at the candy machine.

57
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:05,438
Really? I tell him he's gained weight.

58
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:09,041
He skips dinner, sulks in his room, and
I have the whole evening to myself.

59
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:10,505
Oh, good.

60
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:14,483
Okay, you tell Frederick I said bravo.

61
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:18,251
Frederick just passed the qualifying
exam for the Marbury Academy!

62
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:20,370
Huzzah!

63
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:24,048
What is that, some school?

64
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:27,446
Some... school?

65
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,509
That's-- He doesn't--

66
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:33,991
Oh, Dad. Oh, Dad, please.

67
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:38,651
No, the Marbury Academy is the most
exclusive private school in all of Boston.

68
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,202
It's a breeding ground
of power and privilege.

69
00:03:41,513 --> 00:03:43,583
Lilith and I have to be interviewed
by the headmaster.

70
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:46,316
He's got a busy schedule.
He has agreed to see us Thanksgiving.

71
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:48,034
This, of course, changes our plans.

72
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:50,063
Wait. You mean I don't get to see
my grandson?

73
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:52,994
Of course you do. We'll move our
Thanksgiving celebration to Boston.

74
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:55,026
- I'll call the airline.
- I'd better cancel

75
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:58,427
our rustic Thanksgiving.
Hello, Buck, it's Dr. Crane.

76
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:01,457
Take the mints off the pillows.

77
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:09,507
Frederick, your father is here.

78
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,861
- Dad!
- Hey, Frederick!

79
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:14,118
- Good to see you.
- Good boy.

80
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:16,847
- Hi, Lilith, how you doing?
- Happy Thanksgiving, Lilith.

81
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:18,326
Martin. Niles.

82
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:21,348
Nice neighborhood. I noticed a whole
bunch of kids Freddie's age

83
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:23,115
- playing in the street.
- Yes.

84
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:27,301
He's spent many happy hours at his
window observing their play patterns.

85
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:32,508
Niles, I'm afraid, with this interview,
I'm running a little behind schedule,

86
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:34,972
so I'm enlisting you to help
with the turkey.

87
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,756
Oh, well, I've never cooked a turkey
before, but the recipe's here.

88
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,709
I guess I can fumble my way through.
How far along are you?

89
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:44,262
I'm nearly done defrosting.

90
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,791
And the turkey?

91
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:54,074
Might I suggest you stuff it?

92
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:59,739
So the rabbit says to the bear,
"No, no. I said, 'Oedipal' not 'edible."'

93
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,203
Good one, Dad.

94
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:04,395
- Hello, Lilith.
- You're late.

95
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:07,071
Oh, well, happy Thanksgiving
to you too.

96
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:08,623
Well, there, Frederick.

97
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,080
Now, Mommy and Daddy have
to run off to this meeting.

98
00:05:11,353 --> 00:05:14,026
After that, I'm all yours. Meanwhile,
why don't you head on upstairs

99
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:16,108
and show Granddad and Niles
your new computer?

100
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:18,155
- Okay.
- Come on, sport.

101
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,153
My God, are you half as nervous
as I am?

102
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:23,475
- And then some.
- We have got to master our nerves.

103
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:27,498
It is vital that we appear to be
well-adjusted, responsible parents.

104
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:31,578
Lilith, do you still keep the Valium
with the contraceptives?

105
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:36,083
Sorry, I needed the last one just
to go in and pick up the application.

106
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,597
I'll assume you meant the Valium.

107
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:44,279
Perhaps before the interview

108
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:48,186
you should sheathe
that butter-knife-sharp wit of yours.

109
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:50,547
Perhaps we could find
the appropriate kitchen tool

110
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:53,960
to ratchet down that bun of yours
a notch or two.

111
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:57,486
Frasier, stop.
We should be focusing on our son.

112
00:05:57,774 --> 00:06:00,049
You're right, of course.
We've always had our differences,

113
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:02,434
but we've put them aside
for the welfare of Frederick.

114
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:06,412
This may be the most important thing
we ever do to ensure his happiness.

115
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:08,933
Not counting our divorce.

116
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:12,356
Freddie's gonna break in
this new mitt I bought him.

117
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:14,817
Frederick doesn't play ball.

118
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,923
He was just about to watch
<i>Pocahontas</i> and write a satiric essay

119
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,008
on the historical inaccuracies.

120
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:22,950
Well, we're off.

121
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:24,892
Now, wait. Where do you
keep your saffron?

122
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:27,171
- Third cupboard.
- Um-hmm. Where are your shallots?

123
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:30,182
In the crisper. By the way,
you still have to remove the entrails

124
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:31,667
from the chest cavity.

125
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:36,184
In that case, where do you keep
your ten-foot pole?

126
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:40,445
All right, Mommy and Daddy
are going to see

127
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:44,970
that you're wearing a Marbury blazer,
or die trying.

128
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:47,449
Dad, maybe you
should remove the entrails.

129
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:50,418
No can do.
Freddie and I are gonna play catch.

130
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:52,932
Mother says balls
are for the slow children.

131
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:55,593
Yeah?
Well, Grandpa's in charge now.

132
00:06:55,874 --> 00:06:58,627
You're gonna love baseball.
It's easy as riding a bike.

133
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,316
- Mother says bikes are--
- Yeah, I know. I know.

134
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:24,250
- Dr. Campbell.
- Dr. Sternin.

135
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:25,805
- Dr. Campbell.
- Dr. Crane.

136
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:27,621
Please come in.

137
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:30,529
- You have a lovely home.
- Yes.

138
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:32,263
Thank you so much
for seeing us today.

139
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:34,883
You're welcome. Make yourselves
comfortable. I'll get coffee.

140
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:36,198
Thank you.

141
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:38,166
I think that went
rather well, don't you?

142
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,088
So far, so good.

143
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:43,182
Oh, my God, we have just got to get
Frederick into this school.

144
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:48,332
I am so nervous. I feel as though all
the color has drained from my face.

145
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,995
- How is my makeup?
- Well, you could use a pinch.

146
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:56,423
- Oh, do I have time?
- No, no, no, you can use a pinch.

147
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:59,319
Thank you.

148
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:01,690
- Oh, oh, Lord. Oh, oh, dear.
- What?

149
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,817
Oh, well, I, uh--

150
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:07,025
I just reached down to pull a thread
off what I thought was on my jacket.

151
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,197
It seems it's attached to this cushion.

152
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:12,481
Oh, Lord.
Look, now this little bird has no beak.

153
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:15,582
- Stop doing that.
- I, um-- Give me your nail clippers.

154
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:19,419
- I didn't bring them. Just bite it off.
- All right.

155
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:24,467
- Does either of you take cream?
- Yes. Yes, thank you.

156
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,110
Then let me begin by saying
that the child who fills this opening

157
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:29,744
need not worry for the future.

158
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,240
"Opening"? There's only one?

159
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:36,266
Yes. Well, children of alumni
and certain generous benefactors

160
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,271
are, of course, given preference.

161
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,675
- Of course.
- Of course.

162
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:42,488
Now regarding your Frederick,
his scores, of course, are excellent,

163
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:45,650
and I have no doubt he is being
courted by other prestigious schools.

164
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:47,815
- Oh, yes.
- Yes, that goes without saying.

165
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:51,220
Still, we like to think
that we are a cut above.

166
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:52,801
Our sixth-grade talent show

167
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:56,032
just spawned
a highly successful cast album.

168
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:59,539
Frederick has perfect pitch.

169
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:03,949
Yes, we often use him
to tune the piano.

170
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:07,881
Excuse me.

171
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:09,864
Hello?

172
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:11,941
Senator Geiger.

173
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:16,731
I thought I'd made it perfectly plain
that you'd be notified by mail.

174
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:20,143
Well, senator, rules may not mean
anything on Capitol Hill,

175
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:22,995
but they still mean something to me.

176
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:28,273
And that is why young Noah will be
seeking his education elsewhere.

177
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:31,526
Do I sound flexible?

178
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:36,910
Marbury thanks you for your interest.

179
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:41,129
- Frasier, your coffee.
- Oh, yes, please be careful.

180
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:44,528
Those chairs have been
in the family for three generations.

181
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:53,484
Okay, let's take a look.

182
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,847
Oh, it's not so bad.

183
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:05,264
- You hardly notice it.
- Uh-oh.

184
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:08,199
- I lost my MedicAlert bracelet.
- Oh, maybe it fell off

185
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:10,235
- when we were playing catch.
- I'll go look.

186
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:12,077
All right.

187
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:15,827
I still don't know how it happened.
I lobbed it right to him.

188
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:18,227
When will you learn?
The only thing the Crane boys

189
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:22,122
are skilled at catching is sarcastic
nuance and the occasional virus.

190
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:26,270
Let's make a pact that as long as
we're guests of Lilith's,

191
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:30,013
we'll avoid all activities
that could possibly harm Frederick.

192
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:32,568
Where are those pie crusts?

193
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:34,069
Found it.

194
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:43,173
I taste blood.

195
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:47,788
- Now you've done it.
- My God, Frederick, I am so sorry.

196
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:51,250
Squeeze right up here. There.

197
00:10:51,735 --> 00:10:55,125
It's them. Hey, pal, why don't we
go find some cotton upstairs

198
00:10:55,447 --> 00:10:57,119
- for that thing, huh?
- Wait, wait, wait.

199
00:10:57,365 --> 00:11:00,118
- How will I explain this to Lilith?
- How did you give Maris bad news?

200
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:03,808
Usually by breaking a tranquillizer
into her Slim-Fast.

201
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:11,618
Did you notice how
those patrician eyebrows of his arched

202
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:14,230
when you mentioned
Frederick's National Science Award?

203
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,225
- Yes.
- I take it Dr. Campbell

204
00:11:16,468 --> 00:11:17,821
was favorably impressed?

205
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:20,521
- Ohhh.
- We had an initial bout of nervousness,

206
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:23,558
but after that, we did
an absolute bang-up job.

207
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:25,488
Speaking of bang-up jobs--

208
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:27,922
You know, Lilith,
there's just one question

209
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:30,543
- I wish we'd answered differently.
- Which one?

210
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:32,973
Remember, he mentioned
Frederick was being courted

211
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:34,462
by other schools?

212
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,332
I wonder if we shouldn't have
made it clear

213
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:39,131
that Marbury is far and away
our first choice.

214
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:42,088
Frasier, if you overanalyze
every detail,

215
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:44,519
you will rob us
of the joy of the moment.

216
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:47,905
It will be our wedding night
all over again.

217
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:52,029
Speaking of hard-to-explain bruises--

218
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:56,049
Yes, well, you're right. You're right,
of course. I'm sure everything's fine.

219
00:11:56,383 --> 00:12:00,820
Unless we didn't convey to him
how highly we regard Marbury.

220
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:02,415
Well, see, that is my worry.

221
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:05,611
We must correct this.
What should I say?

222
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:09,362
Oh, Lilith, stop! Stop! Remember what
happened when the senator called?

223
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,918
- We need-- We need a ruse.
- You're right.

224
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:14,427
How's this?

225
00:12:14,693 --> 00:12:17,890
We go back, and I say that I lost
my earring in his living room.

226
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:20,035
While looking for it,
we casually mention

227
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:22,431
that Marbury
is Frederick's first and only choice.

228
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:24,054
- Perfect.
- Let's go.

229
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:28,172
Speaking of dumb-ass ideas...

230
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:37,849
Ah, yes, Dr. Campbell, I hope we're
not disturbing anything important.

231
00:12:38,133 --> 00:12:41,170
Actually, I'm a bit frazzled trying to get
my Thanksgiving dinner together.

232
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:44,381
I'm afraid I lost an earring
here this morning.

233
00:12:44,723 --> 00:12:47,078
Well, I'll have a look around
and call you if it turns up.

234
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:49,022
- Well, um--
- Uh, do you think

235
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:51,146
I might be able
to take a peek right now?

236
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:56,595
I wouldn't even think of asking, but it
was a treasured gift from Golda Meir.

237
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:01,501
- Very well.
- Thank you.

238
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:06,138
Forgive me, I must turn the heat down
on the pumpkin soup.

239
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:08,970
We rehearsed everything
we were going to say on the ride over.

240
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:11,636
Where the hell did Golda Meir
come from?

241
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:15,314
I admit it wasn't half
as clever as "um."

242
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,502
- But it got us in.
- Mm-hmm.

243
00:13:18,757 --> 00:13:21,191
- Any luck?
- Not yet.

244
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:26,628
We're so sorry about this. The whole
ride over here we kept saying:

245
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:31,016
"Why did this have to happen at
the only school that matters to us?"

246
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:34,067
Yes, as you know,
Marbury is our first choice.

247
00:13:34,356 --> 00:13:36,392
Oh, look, here it is.

248
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:39,539
- That was lucky.
- Remarkably so.

249
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:42,580
Considering that wasn't the chair
you were sitting in.

250
00:13:42,864 --> 00:13:44,183
- Um--
- Well, I suppose it's time

251
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:46,602
we be shoving off.

252
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:50,019
I'm curious. I've always been
a great admirer of Mrs. Meir.

253
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,048
How did you meet?

254
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:55,775
Oh, well, it's a funny story.

255
00:13:56,086 --> 00:13:57,883
Oh, yes. Yeah.

256
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:01,269
Frasier, you tell it
much better than I do.

257
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:08,837
Oh, yes. Yes.
It was back in college days.

258
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:12,538
Lilith spent a summer at a kibbutz

259
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:16,731
and was dating her grandson, Oscar.

260
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,238
That would be Oscar Meir?

261
00:14:24,906 --> 00:14:27,466
Yes. Well, just imagine
the ribbing he took.

262
00:14:27,742 --> 00:14:31,860
Indeed. Well, it's so good
to see you both again.

263
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:35,641
Enjoy your Thanksgiving.
Marbury thanks you for your interest.

264
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:38,390
Wait. Wait a minute.
"Marbury thanks you for your interest."

265
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,262
- We know what that means.
- Oh, good.

266
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:43,744
Then you'll have no trouble
interpreting this.

267
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:48,866
You had to give him gum, didn't you?

268
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:52,536
Not just gum, bubble gum.

269
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:55,403
Maybe what threw him off is having
to breathe through his mouth

270
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:57,359
while he chewed it.

271
00:14:57,605 --> 00:15:00,597
You know, Frederick, when I was a
boy nothing brought a smile to my face

272
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:04,575
like when Mother would make
a rémoulade and let me lick the spoon.

273
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:06,504
- Thanks, Uncle Niles.
- You're welcome.

274
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:09,129
You think maybe
I should trim his bangs a little bit?

275
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:13,004
Maybe you should put the scissors
down while he still has one good eye.

276
00:15:14,164 --> 00:15:15,483
Uh-oh.

277
00:15:15,874 --> 00:15:19,503
- Is there anchovies in this?
- Yes.

278
00:15:19,878 --> 00:15:23,553
Oh, my God, I've never seen hives
break out that fast.

279
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,495
- They're back!
- Freddie, you got any pills for this?

280
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:30,032
I got pills for everything.

281
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:39,644
Of all the names in the universe,
you had to pick "Oscar."

282
00:15:41,316 --> 00:15:44,467
You started us down that path
of insanity.

283
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:48,612
Golda Meir. Golda my ass!

284
00:15:50,325 --> 00:15:52,634
This sniping is pointless.

285
00:15:52,911 --> 00:15:55,300
Getting into Marbury
was a long shot anyway.

286
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,774
You heard the man.

287
00:15:56,998 --> 00:16:01,276
Most of these openings go to children
of alumni and generous benefactors.

288
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:03,584
Yes, yes.

289
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,552
Wait a minute.

290
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:08,359
Oh, my God, we're such fools.
See what he was trying to tell us?

291
00:16:08,677 --> 00:16:11,145
He was trying to give us the way
to get Frederick accepted.

292
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:15,305
Are you saying he was fishing
for a donation?

293
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:20,860
So you think he was just trying to see
if we were willing to pay our fair share?

294
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:22,785
What else?

295
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:25,110
- Hi, Daddy.
- In a minute, Frederick.

296
00:16:25,402 --> 00:16:27,358
God, it was right in front of us,
and we missed it.

297
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:30,843
- We didn't even see it.
- How could we be so blind?

298
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,032
Maybe we should get ourselves back
there and give him what he wants.

299
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:37,319
Right. We can't let anything stand
in the way of our son's welfare.

300
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:39,453
- Mother.
- Mother has to run, munchkin.

301
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:41,778
Go play with Grandpa.

302
00:16:52,095 --> 00:16:55,246
Ah, Dr. Sternin and Dr. Crane.

303
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:58,237
Forgive me if I don't give you
a big hello hug,

304
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,676
but as you can see,
I'm wearing this greasy apron.

305
00:17:00,979 --> 00:17:04,096
On top of which, I'm beginning
to loathe the sight of both of you.

306
00:17:04,441 --> 00:17:05,999
All the more reason for us to be brief.

307
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:09,271
Yes, I'm sure you'll be on your way just
as soon as you've found the cufflink

308
00:17:09,571 --> 00:17:11,801
given to you by Haile Selassie.

309
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,491
No false pretense this time.

310
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:22,178
We know that with so many qualified
applicants and only one position open

311
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:25,010
that your decision
must be very difficult.

312
00:17:25,337 --> 00:17:27,931
Yes. And so,
in the spirit of the holidays,

313
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:30,011
like Indians
to your Pilgrims' table,

314
00:17:30,258 --> 00:17:34,012
we bring this little bit of garnish,
as it were,

315
00:17:34,346 --> 00:17:37,656
in the hopes that our relationship
may flower.

316
00:17:40,268 --> 00:17:43,783
I'll have you know that, in 22 years,
I have never accepted a bribe.

317
00:17:44,105 --> 00:17:46,573
I have to tell you
that I find this utterly offensive...

318
00:17:46,858 --> 00:17:49,133
...in every possible way.

319
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:53,777
Now, if you don't mind,
I have guests on the way

320
00:17:54,032 --> 00:17:58,344
and a turkey so undercooked a skilled
veterinarian could still save him.

321
00:17:59,788 --> 00:18:03,576
- But, Dr. Campbell--
- Unless the rest of that sentence is:

322
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:06,670
"I have a fully cooked turkey"
in the breast pocket of that blazer,

323
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:10,192
I'm afraid our conversation
is at an end.

324
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,261
Muah!

325
00:19:10,191 --> 00:19:13,263
This is indeed
a very special holiday for us all.

326
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:16,721
Pamela, Cynthia,
I'm particularly grateful

327
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:20,270
that finally you've been able
to set aside your differences

328
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:22,449
and join us in this Thanksgiving...

329
00:19:22,704 --> 00:19:24,820
...tortellini.

330
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:29,461
Well, as angry as I was
that you admitted Regan into Marbury

331
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:32,228
instead of our Wesley,
it's all worked out for the best.

332
00:19:32,547 --> 00:19:35,061
Wesley is thriving
at the Barkley School.

333
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:36,702
I'm delighted to hear it.

334
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:40,077
Oh, I have a dusty bottle
of Chateau Lafitte in the cellar

335
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:42,424
waiting for an occasion like this.

336
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:46,523
Well...

337
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:49,643
This is nice.

338
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,634
Yes, it is.

339
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:55,278
- I'll get it.
- I'll get it.

340
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:04,439
- Hello.
- Hello, is Dr. Campbell in?

341
00:20:04,788 --> 00:20:07,427
Yes, he's just gone to the cellar
to get a bottle of wine.

342
00:20:07,749 --> 00:20:09,068
Don't mean to intrude,
but we heard

343
00:20:09,292 --> 00:20:11,681
he was having trouble with his turkey,
thought we'd drop this by.

344
00:20:12,003 --> 00:20:14,437
Oh, how very generous of you.
Please, come in.

345
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:17,592
- Oh, thank you.
- Look, everyone, friends of Colin's

346
00:20:17,926 --> 00:20:20,121
- have brought us a turkey.
- Well, I think "friends"

347
00:20:20,387 --> 00:20:23,140
is probably stretching it just a tad.

348
00:20:23,431 --> 00:20:26,787
You see, our son
was a candidate for Marbury,

349
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:30,579
and in our zeal to see him accepted,
we may have come on a bit strongly.

350
00:20:30,897 --> 00:20:34,446
Yes. Well, I mean, I'm sure you
understand, as parents yourselves.

351
00:20:34,818 --> 00:20:37,616
It's only natural to wish
the very best for your son.

352
00:20:37,946 --> 00:20:39,902
- Oh, absolutely.
- There are other good schools.

353
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:43,193
- Barkley is excellent.
- Yes. Well, thank you very much

354
00:20:43,493 --> 00:20:45,449
for trying to cheer us up.
But I mean, really,

355
00:20:45,704 --> 00:20:50,061
if you're looking for a filet mignon,
you can hardly swallow ground chuck.

356
00:20:51,668 --> 00:20:55,263
Now, now.
Barkley is a very charming little school.

357
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:58,747
- "Little school"?
- Now, don't be so sensitive.

358
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:01,803
- Damn your condescension.
- Damn your jealousy!

359
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:05,167
- Don't talk to my wife that way!
- Oh, shut up, Elliot.

360
00:21:05,515 --> 00:21:07,187
Don't you talk to my husband
that way!

361
00:21:12,814 --> 00:21:14,452
Quiet!

362
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:17,535
We brought a turkey.

363
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:20,150
I don't know how this started.

364
00:21:20,405 --> 00:21:23,636
I can only be sure it started
with the two of you.

365
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,861
- Actually, we--
- I will die a happy man

366
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:28,474
if I never set eyes
on either of you again.

367
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:31,825
Unfortunately, there's only one way
I can think of to ensure that.

368
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:34,601
Your son Frederick is hereby admitted
to the Marbury School.

369
00:21:35,253 --> 00:21:39,041
However, he will be immediately
expelled if either of you violates

370
00:21:39,382 --> 00:21:40,781
any of the following conditions:

371
00:21:41,009 --> 00:21:43,364
You will not bring him to school.
You will not collect him.

372
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:47,709
You will not attend any recitals, plays,
sporting events or school functions

373
00:21:48,099 --> 00:21:52,138
up to and including Frederick Crane
Day, should we ever have one.

374
00:21:52,479 --> 00:21:53,798
And when graduation comes,

375
00:21:54,022 --> 00:21:57,776
you will dispatch an appropriate envoy
with a video camera.

376
00:21:58,109 --> 00:21:59,986
And now it is with great pleasure

377
00:22:00,236 --> 00:22:04,024
- that I bid you goodbye forever.
- Allow me.

378
00:22:07,202 --> 00:22:09,511
We're in.
