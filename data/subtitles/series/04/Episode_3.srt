1
00:00:35,618 --> 00:00:37,415
Whoa.

2
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:03,350
Well, look who's up.

3
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:14,950
<i>It's my parents. I don't know,</i>
<i>they're just, like, really stupid.</i>

4
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:17,558
- May I ask how old you are?
- <i>Fourteen.</i>

5
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:20,189
Well, hang on, Jimmy.
Your parents are gonna be stupid

6
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:22,252
for another seven years.

7
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:25,247
<i>Whoa, seven years?</i>

8
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:27,659
<i>That's, like, longer than</i>
<i>I'll be in high school.</i>

9
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:30,351
I salute your optimism.

10
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:32,444
We'll be right back after this.

11
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:37,283
Oh, God, Roz. A teenager
who's embarrassed by his parents?

12
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:40,350
Can't you come up with something
a little more challenging for me?

13
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:43,110
It was either him or our
old pal Rudy, the crier.

14
00:01:43,395 --> 00:01:46,034
Rudy, the crier. He's been on
three times in the last month.

15
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:49,306
You put him on again, he won't
be the only one who's crying.

16
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:52,207
God, I'm in a dry spell.

17
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:54,682
Where are the souls
of genuine torment?

18
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:58,026
The people teetering on the brink
of genuine despair?

19
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:01,838
Oh, they'll be back. The holidays
are just around the corner.

20
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:03,604
Well, perhaps you're right.

21
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:05,106
Oh, Roz.

22
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:07,642
- I've a question I'd like to ask you.
- Shoot.

23
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:11,958
Have you ever had a recurring dream
of an intimate nature about someone...

24
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:14,573
Well, a coworker?

25
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:17,159
- Oh, no, why'd you tell me?
- Oh, Roz.

26
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:20,341
Now it's gonna be creepy every time
you look at me through the glass.

27
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:22,115
Roz, not you!

28
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:24,758
- Who was it then?
- I'm not gonna go into specifics.

29
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,897
- Gina in accounting?
- I'm not gonna do this.

30
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:30,275
- Oh, Sheila, the slow intern?
- Forget I even mentioned it.

31
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:32,739
Knock, knock.

32
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:35,090
Gil.

33
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:37,391
Frasier, I've come to tempt you.

34
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:39,212
Really?

35
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:44,202
I am reviewing the new pastry chef
at Chez Shea. And I quote:

36
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:46,458
"His amaretto Ã©clair is so sinful,

37
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:50,303
it will send you scurrying to your
local padre for absolution."

38
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,750
No, thank you, Gil.
I'm on a diet, you see.

39
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:58,599
- Oh, come now, you know you want it.
- No, no, no, I really don't.

40
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,250
Off you go. Bye-bye.

41
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:04,036
- Oh, my God!
- What?

42
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:05,780
- It was Gil!
- I never said that.

43
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:07,574
- Then why are you blushing?
- Don't be ridiculous!

44
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,367
- Your ears are turning red.
- I am not.

45
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:11,358
You are.

46
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:17,353
Still not blushing.

47
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:20,874
<i>Just lying there in the hospital bed,</i>

48
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:23,275
<i>she lifted her head off the pillow,</i>

49
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:29,327
<i>looked up and said, "I love you."</i>
<i>And then she was gone.</i>

50
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:31,867
Rudy, stop crying.

51
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:35,427
Now, we've gone over this before.

52
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:38,427
What was our agreement
about sad movies?

53
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:44,118
- <i>I shouldn't watch them.</i>
- Exactly.

54
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:46,077
Now, go get a cool washcloth

55
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:48,425
to try to bring down
the puffiness around your eyes,

56
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:52,123
and please stay away
from sad or depressing things.

57
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,671
Which, at this moment, includes
listening to the <i>Frasier Crane Show</i>.

58
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:58,465
Well, let's shoot it to the news.

59
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:02,413
That's it for today.
This is Dr. Frasier Crane.

60
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:06,671
Oh, my God!
Well, close the record books.

61
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:10,272
That was just the dullest three hours in
the history of the <i>Frasier Crane Show</i>.

62
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,096
Oh, come on, it wasn't so bad.

63
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:14,724
What about the woman who was so
concerned about her appearance

64
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:17,838
- she wouldn't leave the house?
- That was a commercial!

65
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:21,469
I believe Miss Clairol
solved the problem.

66
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:24,078
Well, I'll see you tomorrow, Roz.
Oh, Roz.

67
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:26,736
About that dream I mentioned
to you earlier...

68
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:29,709
It goes without saying,
I'd rather you didn't share that.

69
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:33,171
- Oh, sure.
- Hi, dream boy.

70
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:36,485
I hate you.

71
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,407
Couldn't keep
your mouth shut, could you?

72
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:40,765
Just when did you find
the time to spread the news?

73
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:43,632
You don't think I was listening
to your show, do you?

74
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:47,382
Coming through!

75
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,497
Oh, doc, I gotta rub
this one in a little.

76
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:51,739
All right, Bulldog, before
you start to ridicule me,

77
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,718
yes, yes, I had a dream about Gil,

78
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:57,677
and, yes, it did have some
erotic elements, but--

79
00:04:58,048 --> 00:05:00,243
You have no idea what
I'm talking about, do you?

80
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,984
I do now. Whoa!

81
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:05,995
Look, let's just forget it.

82
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:08,133
What delightful jibe did you
have prepared for me?

83
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:11,311
Oh, I was gonna tell you your show
today just broke the snooze-o-meter,

84
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:14,879
but now I wanna hear about you
greasing Gil's cookie sheet.

85
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,095
I'm on a bus to hell.

86
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:26,462
So I returned to the dry cleaners
yet a third time.

87
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:28,893
I hardly need to tell you
how the story ends.

88
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:31,081
Just tell me when the story ends.

89
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:35,547
Fine. They realigned
my pleats. The end.

90
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:38,872
I'm sorry, Niles.
I'm just a bit distracted today.

91
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:42,323
See, this morning a man
from my building,

92
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:44,352
approached me with
an intriguing problem.

93
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:46,983
Seems he's been having
a recurring dream.

94
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:49,823
Please, that little gambit didn't work
when we were in knee socks.

95
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:52,701
- What was your dream, Frasier?
- Oh, all right.

96
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:57,440
It's been tormenting me. I haven't
been able to sleep in weeks now.

97
00:05:57,941 --> 00:06:02,219
It's a bit hazy, but it starts out
in a seedy motel room.

98
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,322
- I'm naked.
- Interesting.

99
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:08,008
Yes, well, I roll over
and discover on my forearm

100
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:11,159
a tattoo with the word "chesty."

101
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:14,329
- Interesting.
- Yes. And then the shower turns off.

102
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:17,226
Out from the bathroom steps...

103
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:18,818
...a man.

104
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,314
All right, go ahead, let me have it.

105
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:26,530
Are you saying that now,
or is that a quote from the dream?

106
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:31,030
Please.

107
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:34,868
We're too intelligent to waste time
on the obvious interpretation.

108
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:38,296
Yes. But you must admit
it's rather intriguing.

109
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:39,880
Would you stop?

110
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,710
It's obviously screaming for
a Jungian interpretation.

111
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:45,022
The sexuality in the dream
is surely symbolic

112
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,396
of some deeper non-sexual conflict.

113
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:51,294
- All right.
- Good afternoon, Frasier.

114
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:53,622
- Gil.
- A little birdie tells me,

115
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:56,545
I was featured in your midnight movie.

116
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,437
Very clever. Off you go.

117
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:01,269
Very well. See you tomorrow,

118
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:04,337
or should I say,
see you in your dreams.

119
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,674
In this dream of yours,
were there any cigars,

120
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:11,442
bananas or short, blunt swords?

121
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:15,443
Would you stop it?
I'm 43, a little late for latency.

122
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:18,051
- You guys okay over here?
- We're fine.

123
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:20,304
Well, you must be new here.

124
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:22,601
I would've remembered such
a pretty face as yours.

125
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:24,732
- You're overcompensating.
- Right.

126
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:26,905
We're fine. Bye-bye.

127
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:33,154
I'm just baffled by it. Gil Chesterton
explains "chesty," but little else.

128
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:35,766
You should tackle this from
a free-association standpoint.

129
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:38,678
- Oh, God. Must we?
- Focus on a detail in the motel room.

130
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,869
What's the first thing
that pops into your mind?

131
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:42,939
A crescent-shaped lamp.

132
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:46,083
Perfect. A crescent-shaped lamp.
Run with that.

133
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:47,857
Crescent. Moon.

134
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:49,845
Daphne Moon. French maid.

135
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:52,609
- Brass bed. Satin rope.
- Niles!

136
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:57,474
- This is my dream.
- I was just showing you the process.

137
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:59,847
You were three words away
from a cigarette.

138
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,236
- Your turn.
- All right.

139
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:06,236
- Crescent lamp.
- Crescent.

140
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:08,135
Croissant.

141
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:11,435
Butter. Apricot jam.

142
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:14,100
Hunger. Food. Diet.

143
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:17,292
My God, I've been on a diet.
Do you think that's useful?

144
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:19,772
You could stand to lose a few pounds.

145
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:22,767
Just wait a minute.

146
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:26,063
All right, Gil is a restaurant critic.
He's a gourmet.

147
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,614
Perhaps he's symbolic of the food
I've been denying myself.

148
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:30,316
That would explain why you're naked.

149
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:32,788
It's when we're most
self-conscious about our bodies.

150
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:35,974
Yes, and most vulnerable
to the way society tattoos us,

151
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:39,144
with labels about our appearance.
Oh, my God, that's it, Niles.

152
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:42,553
The dream is simply telling me that
I've been too rigid about my diet.

153
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:45,131
You'll know tonight.
If this is the correct interpretation,

154
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,312
the conflict will have passed from your
unconscious to your conscious mind.

155
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:50,450
Yes. The dream will have
served its purpose.

156
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:53,970
- And you'll no longer be plagued by it.
- Oh, God. I've nailed it. I really have.

157
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:55,883
Finally, for the first time in weeks,

158
00:08:56,161 --> 00:09:00,916
there'll be no tequila bottles, no tattoo,
no half-naked man in my bed.

159
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:05,045
So then the rabbi says...

160
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:34,608
Oh, I'm sorry.

161
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:36,697
Wrong room.

162
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:42,635
That does it.
We're finding another motel.

163
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,289
Oh, God.

164
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:56,027
Hello.

165
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:01,427
Someone followed me again
last night.

166
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:03,323
You're just being paranoid.

167
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:04,922
I'm telling you, they're on to me.

168
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:09,264
Come on, nobody could recognize
you after all that plastic surgery.

169
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:12,426
That's what Marlena thought.

170
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:16,693
Marlena got sloppy. She never
should've gone back to ZÃ¼rich.

171
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:19,907
I just don't want
any more bloodshed.

172
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:22,550
Relax, you're home-free.

173
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:25,709
You don't know
the Woodchuck and his ways.

174
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:38,043
- Oh, we're terrible.
- We are? You are.

175
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:40,177
"The Woodchuck and his ways"?

176
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,703
You know, we really should stop
doing this. It's not nice.

177
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:45,251
Yeah, you're right.
We won't do it anymore.

178
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,815
How'd you get the stuff
through customs?

179
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:59,428
They never check the wooden leg.

180
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:03,929
The answer has got to be
in there somewhere.

181
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:07,993
Here's something. "Dreams
as an expression of wish-fulfillment."

182
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:10,132
Moving on.

183
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:13,593
Goodness, are you two still here?

184
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,432
- What are you working on?
- Nothing.

185
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,189
I'm helping Frasier interpret
a dream he's been having.

186
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:21,613
You know, maybe Dad can help.

187
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:23,205
No, no, no. No, no, no.

188
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:26,152
Don't want to bore Dad with the
details of this particular dream.

189
00:11:26,478 --> 00:11:28,389
Dreams can be rooted
in childhood experience.

190
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,360
Maybe Dad remembers
something you repressed.

191
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:32,677
Gee, I don't know.
If it's about when you were a kid,

192
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,819
I've repressed a lot of that myself.

193
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:38,740
This is not a dream I wish to share
with Dad, thank you very much.

194
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:40,670
We've exhausted every
other interpretation,

195
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:43,059
so I guess it's back
to dreams as wish-fulfillment.

196
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:46,168
Oh, Dad, would you mind
listening to my dream

197
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:48,651
to see if it conjures up
any memories from my childhood?

198
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:50,748
Oh, come on, you're making
too much out of this.

199
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:52,401
It's a dream. Dreams are weird.

200
00:11:52,671 --> 00:11:55,504
Okay, please, Dad, I wouldn't ask
if it weren't really bothering me.

201
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,671
- Oh, all right. Go on.
- All right now.

202
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:59,958
It starts out in a little motel room.

203
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:03,098
I have a tattoo on my arm, "chesty."

204
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,661
See? That's weird.

205
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:08,250
Yes, but then out
from the bathroom steps a--

206
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,794
All right, now before I continue,

207
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:13,377
just let me remind you that this is a
dream, not to be confused with reality.

208
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:17,153
Out from the bathroom steps a...

209
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:19,037
...man...

210
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:21,047
...eating lion.

211
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:22,874
Oh, see?

212
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,831
There again, weird.

213
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:28,832
Look, dreams come, they go.
They don't mean anything.

214
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:31,926
Except if you're lucky once in a while,
you might have one that's fun.

215
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:34,720
Like, you know, you're hitting
a home run in the World Series,

216
00:12:35,005 --> 00:12:37,121
or you're in the jungle
with Jayne Mansfield

217
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:39,976
- and she gets bit by a snake.
- Thank you, Dad.

218
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,535
- You know who Jayne Mansfield is?
- Yes, Dad.

219
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:46,001
- Know what they do when you're bit?
- Yes, Dad.

220
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:49,967
Wish I knew what I had
for dinner that night.

221
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:53,303
Oh, I get it.
"Chesty" refers to Gil Chesterton.

222
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:55,931
Niles, you gossipy fishwife.

223
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:58,714
There's no reason to feel
self-conscious, Dr. Crane.

224
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:00,701
We've all had dreams like that.

225
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:04,064
I had one about a girl I shared
a flat with once. A gymnast.

226
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:06,923
Go on, Daphne.
This could be significant.

227
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:11,754
Well, I remember we were doing
stretches in the gymnasium,

228
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:14,283
when suddenly we decided
to take off all our clothes

229
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:17,456
and go for a bounce
on the trampoline.

230
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:20,516
The next thing you know, I'm chasing
her around the pommel horse and--

231
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,074
Oh, never mind.

232
00:13:22,344 --> 00:13:24,255
Don't stop now.

233
00:13:26,598 --> 00:13:28,475
This could help us.

234
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:34,288
Well, actually, I do have a theory
of me own about your dream,

235
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:36,873
- if you'd like to hear it.
- What the hell.

236
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:41,940
Well, in your dream,
who was in the shower? Gil.

237
00:13:42,364 --> 00:13:44,798
What is a shower? Running water.

238
00:13:45,075 --> 00:13:47,430
Who needs water? Fish.

239
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:49,579
What do fish have? Gills.

240
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,899
Do you see where I'm going?

241
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:55,555
Insane.

242
00:13:56,878 --> 00:14:00,109
It could be a dream about the loss
of a beloved childhood pet.

243
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:03,855
Thanks a lot, Eddie. Forty-five minutes
in the park, you don't have to go.

244
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:06,771
I get one bite into my sandwich,
and you give me the look.

245
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:10,047
Mr. Crane, did Dr. Crane
ever have a goldfish growing up?

246
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,783
- A fish?
- Yes, as a pet.

247
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,016
How would I know?
That was Hester's department.

248
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,544
Come on, let's go.

249
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:18,711
Frasier, are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

250
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:20,777
That Dad can interpret
the looks from his dog

251
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:23,905
and has only the spottiest
recollections of our childhood?

252
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,510
No, no, no. Hester.

253
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:30,332
Hesty. The tattoo. That's only
one letter away from chesty.

254
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:33,776
Then are you saying that the dream
could have been about Mother?

255
00:14:34,124 --> 00:14:35,398
Well?

256
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:37,297
I suppose I could've
misread the tattoo.

257
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:41,219
Yes, this freckle pattern here on my
arm could be mistaken for a C.

258
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:44,387
And what swims in the sea? Fish.

259
00:14:46,678 --> 00:14:49,909
All right, all right. I'll go.

260
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:52,945
Well, so, the tattoo
could've said "Hesty."

261
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:55,740
But the problem is I don't ever
remember Dad calling Mom that.

262
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:57,415
But who's to say he didn't?

263
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:02,564
- Dad, Dad, Dad.
- What?

264
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:04,730
Did you ever have a
nickname for Mother?

265
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:07,498
Oh, for God's sakes,
this to do with that stupid dream?

266
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:09,655
- Dad, this is really important.
- Any pet name?

267
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,422
A term of endearment?

268
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:15,734
Well, when we were first married,
I used to call her "honey."

269
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:18,994
And then there was a time after that
that I started calling her "sweetie."

270
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:22,414
I'm sure there's a delicious anecdote
behind each one of those,

271
00:15:22,714 --> 00:15:25,751
but did you ever call her Hesty?

272
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:28,890
- Hesty?
- Oh, come on! Think, man!

273
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,893
Even once. Once in all the years
you lived together?

274
00:15:32,223 --> 00:15:34,293
Well, I don't know.
I mean, I guess.

275
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:36,709
- Maybe once, you know.
- Oh, thank you, Dad.

276
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,499
Well, there it is.

277
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,448
I must have heard him
call her Hesty once,

278
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:43,200
and neatly tucked it away
into my subconscious.

279
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:45,482
Of course. It's so obvious.

280
00:15:45,737 --> 00:15:48,615
Gil is a food critic. Food. Criticism.

281
00:15:48,907 --> 00:15:50,704
Mother!

282
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:54,120
It's the classic Oedipal dream.

283
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:57,449
Yes. Only I was so frightened by my
sexual urges to be with my mother

284
00:15:57,749 --> 00:16:00,024
that I transformed her into a man.

285
00:16:02,003 --> 00:16:04,642
Oh, what a relief. I've been
wringing my hands over nothing.

286
00:16:04,923 --> 00:16:08,802
I mean it's okay. All I want to do
is have sex with my dead mother.

287
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,548
Mom?

288
00:16:41,084 --> 00:16:42,915
Mommy?

289
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:46,089
Patience, Daddy.

290
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:02,693
You'd think by now I'd know better
than to have that third Slim Jim

291
00:17:02,981 --> 00:17:05,290
before going to bed.

292
00:17:08,445 --> 00:17:10,720
- You couldn't sleep either, huh?
- No.

293
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:14,758
Frankly, I'm sort of afraid to go back
to sleep. It's that damn dream again.

294
00:17:15,118 --> 00:17:16,995
Oh, what are you worried about?
It's just a dream.

295
00:17:17,287 --> 00:17:18,561
Worst case scenario:

296
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:22,459
The man-eating lion leaps
on top of you and mauls you.

297
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:27,513
I'm sorry, Dad. I wasn't completely
truthful with you before.

298
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:31,551
The dream is really about me in
a motel room with a male companion,

299
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:33,034
Gil Chesterton.

300
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,678
You don't care if I ever
sleep again, do you?

301
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:39,267
Dad, please.
I'd really like to discuss this.

302
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:41,792
No, Frasier, please.
This makes me very uncomfortable.

303
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:43,780
- Dad, please?
- I know, I know.

304
00:17:44,022 --> 00:17:46,616
In your generation,
men talk about everything.

305
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,458
Everything's out in the open.

306
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:52,569
You know, what really drives me crazy
is the way you all touch each other.

307
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:55,420
Everybody hugs, you know.

308
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,214
In my generation,
it was a handshake.

309
00:17:58,495 --> 00:17:59,928
That was good enough,

310
00:18:00,205 --> 00:18:02,161
and maybe if you felt
especially close to someone,

311
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:05,452
you could touch them on the shoulder,
but never for more than two seconds.

312
00:18:05,794 --> 00:18:07,910
And don't talk to me
about football players

313
00:18:08,171 --> 00:18:11,527
patting people's butts and everything
because that's different. That's sports.

314
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:14,401
- That's like war. Now, good night, son.
- Dad!

315
00:18:14,678 --> 00:18:16,794
If you wanna tell me something,
write it on a Post-it,

316
00:18:17,055 --> 00:18:20,252
- and stick it on the fridge.
- Look, I really want to talk about this.

317
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,875
I've exhausted every other
interpretation of this dream.

318
00:18:23,144 --> 00:18:25,863
Is it possible my subconscious
is trying to tell me

319
00:18:26,147 --> 00:18:27,739
something about my sexuality?

320
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:29,855
- Oh, that's ridiculous!
- Is it?

321
00:18:30,735 --> 00:18:32,726
I was sensitive as a child.

322
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:34,340
I didn't go in for sports.

323
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:36,130
God, it's every clichÃ© in the book.

324
00:18:36,408 --> 00:18:38,399
Surely it must have occurred
to you at some point.

325
00:18:38,702 --> 00:18:41,136
You refused to take me to see
<i>West Side Story</i> on my birthday.

326
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:42,489
Well, because of the gangs.

327
00:18:42,706 --> 00:18:44,742
- That's scary for kids.
- Even gangs that dance?

328
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,355
Especially gangs that dance.

329
00:18:50,547 --> 00:18:53,983
All right, yeah, okay.
Yeah, I thought about it,

330
00:18:54,342 --> 00:18:57,220
but, no, Frasier, no.
I don't believe that.

331
00:18:57,512 --> 00:19:00,390
And you know why? Because
you would've known by now.

332
00:19:01,016 --> 00:19:03,405
Your unconscious or whatever
the hell you call it

333
00:19:03,685 --> 00:19:06,643
could no more have kept its
yap shut than the rest of you.

334
00:19:09,024 --> 00:19:10,457
- I suppose you're right.
- Yeah.

335
00:19:10,734 --> 00:19:12,008
Now, come on, it's after 3.

336
00:19:12,235 --> 00:19:14,191
You're gonna be worn out
before the show tomorrow.

337
00:19:14,446 --> 00:19:17,199
- What a tragedy that would be.
- Now what're you complaining about?

338
00:19:17,532 --> 00:19:19,204
Oh, no, just...

339
00:19:19,451 --> 00:19:21,487
I haven't had any
really interesting calls lately.

340
00:19:21,745 --> 00:19:24,100
I'm beginning to question
whether I'm bored with psychiatry.

341
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:28,650
You'd never know it the way you got
your nose stuck in all those books.

342
00:19:29,044 --> 00:19:30,318
That's true.

343
00:19:30,545 --> 00:19:32,058
The one saving grace about this dream

344
00:19:32,297 --> 00:19:35,050
is it's given me a chance to flex
my analytical muscle a bit.

345
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:37,055
So maybe it wasn't so bad after all.

346
00:19:37,594 --> 00:19:39,186
Wait a minute.

347
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:42,406
Could that be what this
has been all about?

348
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:44,991
I've been so intellectually
unchallenged lately by my show

349
00:19:45,268 --> 00:19:49,580
that my mind had to create
a dream that defies interpretation

350
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:52,737
- just to give me a challenge?
- I don't know, keep talking.

351
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:54,618
You're making me sleepy.

352
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:58,095
Dad, no, that's got to be it!

353
00:19:58,323 --> 00:20:01,474
My show hasn't provided me with
a single patient worthy of my skills.

354
00:20:01,785 --> 00:20:03,935
And I had to invent one myself. Me.

355
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:06,440
Oh, God, what a relief.

356
00:20:06,748 --> 00:20:09,387
At last, finally, to bed.
Dad, you witnessed an epiphany.

357
00:20:09,668 --> 00:20:11,738
Yeah, God, I gotta
get you to put this on tape.

358
00:20:12,003 --> 00:20:13,436
Well, off we go.

359
00:20:13,672 --> 00:20:17,665
To sleep, perchance not to dream.

360
00:20:43,702 --> 00:20:45,499
Come in.

361
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:49,977
Dr. Crane? Dr. Sigmund Freud.

362
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:53,818
- My goodness, this is quite an honor.
- The honor is all mine.

363
00:20:54,129 --> 00:20:57,724
I gave you a complex psychological
problem, and you solved it.

364
00:20:58,091 --> 00:21:00,082
- Thank you--
- You're a brilliant psychiatrist.

365
00:21:00,343 --> 00:21:04,222
Oh, that's very flattering, but there are
so many things I'd like to ask you.

366
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:06,553
In good time, my boy, in good time.

367
00:21:06,808 --> 00:21:09,959
Right now we have
more important matters.
