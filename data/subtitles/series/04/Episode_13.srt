Well, Joe and I were having dinner.

Everything was nice as could be,
and I said, "Don't you like your potato?"

14
00:00:48,327 --> 00:00:50,887
And he said, "No, I'm not
hungry for potato just now."

15
00:00:51,087 --> 00:00:54,443
I said, "If you don't like your potato,
you're welcome to try my potato."

Daphne, could we hasten to the
post-potato portion of the dialogue?

Well, that's when he said it.

He said we'd been on again,

this evening at Granville's.

302
00:16:38,087 --> 00:16:39,315
We're meeting for drinks.

303
00:16:39,887 --> 00:16:41,445
Granville's.

304
00:16:41,927 --> 00:16:43,963
Why don't you do her a favour?
Let me tell her.

305
00:16:44,127 --> 00:16:48,086
- Might be better coming from a friend.
- Yes, perhaps you're right.

306
00:16:48,247 --> 00:16:49,885
Please tell her that I'm sorry.

307
00:16:50,047 --> 00:16:52,766
Sometimes when a man meets the
woman that he's meant to be with,

308
00:16:52,927 --> 00:16:54,997
there's nothing he can do to resist it.

309
00:16:56,127 --> 00:16:57,640
I hope Daphne understands that.

310
00:17:00,207 --> 00:17:02,118
I hope she understands it too.

311
00:17:05,087 --> 00:17:06,566
Rodney.

312
00:17:07,287 --> 00:17:08,606
Adelle.

313
00:17:11,327 --> 00:17:14,125
You know, there's just one thing
I'd think I'd like to ask you, Rodney.

314
00:17:15,247 --> 00:17:16,566
Do you have an older brother?

315
00:17:17,087 --> 00:17:20,363
As a matter of fact, I do. He's always
been the pride of the family.

316
00:17:20,727 --> 00:17:23,161
Handsome, successful, brilliant.

317
00:17:23,447 --> 00:17:25,563
I've always been rather jealous of him.

318
00:17:27,327 --> 00:17:28,885
Spooky.

319
00:17:36,167 --> 00:17:37,805
[LOUNGE MUSIC PLAYING]

320
00:17:39,567 --> 00:17:42,286
- Evening, Daphne.
- Hello, Dr Crane.

321
00:17:43,047 --> 00:17:45,038
You don't seem surprised to see me.

322
00:17:45,447 --> 00:17:48,325
I was running late so I called
Rodney on his cell phone.

323
00:17:48,487 --> 00:17:52,400
- He told me everything.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

324
00:17:52,567 --> 00:17:54,125
I'm sorry for you too.

325
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:58,517
- Join me in a little sorrow-drowning?
- I believe I will.

326
00:17:58,687 --> 00:18:00,803
One more of these, please.

327
00:18:03,687 --> 00:18:05,200
Thank you.

328
00:18:07,927 --> 00:18:11,476
Well, you know,
I can't really blame Adelle.

329
00:18:11,647 --> 00:18:15,765
Rodney's that sort of man
that women seem to go for.

330
00:18:15,927 --> 00:18:17,599
Yes, he is.

331
00:18:18,087 --> 00:18:21,397
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you.
- No, you didn't.

332
00:18:21,847 --> 00:18:23,405
I guess I'm just more in the mood

333
00:18:23,567 --> 00:18:25,717
to hear about his
negative qualities right now.

334
00:18:25,887 --> 00:18:30,199
Oh, well, he's kind of a know-it-all.
A bit fussy.

335
00:18:30,367 --> 00:18:33,803
Has to have everything just so.
He's nuts about cleanliness.

336
00:18:33,967 --> 00:18:36,003
Then there's his clothes,
his precious shoes.

337
00:18:36,207 --> 00:18:38,357
I don't like this road we're on.

338
00:18:40,647 --> 00:18:45,846
I mean, wouldn't it be better
if we discussed what's in our future?

339
00:18:46,007 --> 00:18:47,520
I suppose.

340
00:18:47,687 --> 00:18:50,759
I'll tell you one thing,
after the run I've had lately,

341
00:18:50,927 --> 00:18:54,442
I pity the next man I date.
I'll probably rip him to shreds.

342
00:18:55,287 --> 00:18:57,403
What about the man after that?

343
00:18:59,447 --> 00:19:03,440
Men can be such an unfeeling lot.
Look at Rodney.

344
00:19:03,607 --> 00:19:07,156
The minute he heard I'd broken up
with someone, he moved in for the kill.

345
00:19:07,807 --> 00:19:09,798
Is that how all men are?

346
00:19:09,967 --> 00:19:12,083
No, not all men.

347
00:19:12,247 --> 00:19:15,683
No, of course they aren't.
You're not.

348
00:19:15,847 --> 00:19:18,645
You're kind, sensitive.

349
00:19:18,807 --> 00:19:21,367
If you ask me, you were
too good for that Adelle.

350
00:19:22,287 --> 00:19:24,164
Thank you, Daphne.

351
00:19:24,847 --> 00:19:28,556
You know, the truth is, my heart
was never really in that relationship.

352
00:19:31,487 --> 00:19:32,840
I thought it might not be.

353
00:19:33,407 --> 00:19:36,683
There was someone else
who was too much on my mind.

354
00:19:37,607 --> 00:19:39,359
I had a feeling, Dr Crane.

355
00:19:40,007 --> 00:19:42,805
- You did?
- Yes.

356
00:19:43,327 --> 00:19:45,522
As long as you still have
feelings for your wife,

357
00:19:45,687 --> 00:19:48,759
you know you can't be involved
with anyone else.

358
00:19:49,527 --> 00:19:50,801
And it makes sense to me.

359
00:19:50,967 --> 00:19:54,403
Why, I know I'd never get involved
with a man who was separated.

360
00:19:55,167 --> 00:19:57,556
Even if he'd worshipped you
from the day he laid eyes on you?

361
00:19:57,807 --> 00:20:01,004
And don't think that's
not just how they put it too.

362
00:20:03,687 --> 00:20:08,602
No, I think I need to do a bit of
separating myself. From Joe, I mean.

363
00:20:08,767 --> 00:20:13,045
Yes, I'll wait a good long time
before I do any more dating.

364
00:20:13,207 --> 00:20:15,675
Well, I'm glad to hear that.

365
00:20:15,847 --> 00:20:18,839
Yeah. You know, it's funny
when you think about it.

366
00:20:19,007 --> 00:20:22,841
The two of us both coming
to this same singles' bar this week.

367
00:20:23,007 --> 00:20:26,477
You know, this was the very stool
I was on when I met Rodney.

368
00:20:26,647 --> 00:20:29,639
I was sitting here when I met Adelle.

369
00:20:31,207 --> 00:20:33,562
- What?
- Oh, I was just thinking.

370
00:20:33,767 --> 00:20:37,840
If it had been a different time in both
our lives, we might actually have met.

371
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:40,757
Oh, how do you suppose
that would have gone?

372
00:20:40,927 --> 00:20:43,646
- What, our conversation?
- Yes. Go on, just for fun.

373
00:20:43,847 --> 00:20:46,281
We could both use a smile.

374
00:20:46,447 --> 00:20:50,042
Well, I would've said,
"Is this seat taken?"

375
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:51,845
And you would've said no.

376
00:20:52,567 --> 00:20:54,956
And you would've said,
"My name is Daphne."

377
00:20:55,127 --> 00:20:57,687
And I would've said,
"My name is Niles."

378
00:20:57,887 --> 00:21:00,162
And then I would've said,

379
00:21:01,407 --> 00:21:04,046
"What are you doing
for the rest of your life?"

380
00:21:05,047 --> 00:21:08,278
You always know
just the right thing to say.

381
00:21:08,447 --> 00:21:11,757
Oh, I love you, Dr Crane.

382
00:21:12,727 --> 00:21:14,922
I love you too, Daphne.
