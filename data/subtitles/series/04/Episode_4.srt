1
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:12,672
Is it me or is the foam
a tad dense today?

2
00:00:12,967 --> 00:00:15,686
Like a dreary fog on a Scottish moor.

3
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:18,530
Rather than accent, it overwhelms.

4
00:00:18,848 --> 00:00:20,964
Rather than flirt, it assaults.

5
00:00:21,267 --> 00:00:24,657
Rather than watching the ball game,
I have to listen to this.

6
00:00:26,397 --> 00:00:27,750
- Hey, you guys.
- Hey, Roz.

7
00:00:27,982 --> 00:00:29,131
- Like to join us?
- Oh, yes.

8
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,954
Frasier, listen, don't forget your staff
meeting tomorrow. It starts at--

9
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:39,074
Well, I certainly hope his tailor can fix
the holes you just burnt in his jacket.

10
00:00:39,702 --> 00:00:42,170
They're not in his jacket.

11
00:00:42,831 --> 00:00:44,503
- It starts tomorrow at 10.
- Thank you.

12
00:00:44,749 --> 00:00:46,228
Hey, Marty, what are
you doing here?

13
00:00:46,459 --> 00:00:48,734
They're dragging me out
to buy some new clothes.

14
00:00:49,003 --> 00:00:51,358
We're taking him to Rudolfo's
once-a-year sale.

15
00:00:51,673 --> 00:00:53,470
It's 50 percent off.
The alterations are free.

16
00:00:53,758 --> 00:00:55,794
Big deal. Butz Clothiers,
they do that every day.

17
00:00:56,052 --> 00:01:00,204
Yes, not to mention the convenience
of getting your pizza right next door.

18
00:01:00,598 --> 00:01:02,509
These guys think I have
bad taste in clothes.

19
00:01:02,809 --> 00:01:03,958
I like the way you dress.

20
00:01:04,227 --> 00:01:06,183
That's what's called the "clincher."
Shall we go?

21
00:01:07,605 --> 00:01:11,154
All right. Well, I'll just hit the head,
and we can get it over with.

22
00:01:11,484 --> 00:01:13,076
Dad, you could show
more enthusiasm.

23
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:14,308
- Yeah.
- Okay.

24
00:01:14,612 --> 00:01:17,524
Gee, I can't wait to hit the head,
and we can get it all over with!

25
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:24,201
Are you finished undressing him
with your eyes?

26
00:01:24,497 --> 00:01:26,169
Please. I'm already
looking for my stockings

27
00:01:26,416 --> 00:01:28,884
and trying to remember
where I parked my car.

28
00:01:30,253 --> 00:01:32,164
I would have thought that gentleman
over there

29
00:01:32,422 --> 00:01:34,174
in the flannel shirt
would be more your type.

30
00:01:34,424 --> 00:01:36,813
Him? Not a chance.

31
00:01:37,218 --> 00:01:38,856
See the way he's slurping
his orange juice?

32
00:01:39,095 --> 00:01:40,892
Sloppy kisser.

33
00:01:41,306 --> 00:01:43,536
Now, you can tell right away
the guy is no good in bed.

34
00:01:43,808 --> 00:01:45,321
He's so cautious.

35
00:01:45,602 --> 00:01:48,275
Look at the way he's blowing
on his coffee.

36
00:01:55,612 --> 00:01:59,366
I wasn't trying to cool it,
I was simply blowing a foam hole.

37
00:02:00,116 --> 00:02:02,152
You don't even wrinkle
the sheets, do you?

38
00:02:03,578 --> 00:02:06,650
Niles, that man across the street
at the newsstand.

39
00:02:06,956 --> 00:02:08,275
Is that who I think it is?

40
00:02:08,541 --> 00:02:09,815
He does look familiar.

41
00:02:10,085 --> 00:02:11,962
- It's T.H. Houghton.
- No!

42
00:02:12,212 --> 00:02:15,170
Just think back to the picture on the
dust cover of his <i>Time Flies Tomorrow</i>.

43
00:02:15,465 --> 00:02:17,615
- A little older, greyer...
- Yeah, <i>Time Flies Tomorrow</i>.

44
00:02:17,884 --> 00:02:18,919
I read that in high school.

45
00:02:19,135 --> 00:02:20,773
- What else did he write?
- Nothing.

46
00:02:21,054 --> 00:02:23,727
That's the crux of his legend.
The man published one masterpiece,

47
00:02:24,015 --> 00:02:26,483
and in the 30 years since,
he's become a virtual recluse.

48
00:02:26,768 --> 00:02:29,885
- Oh, my God. It is T.H. Houghton.
- Yes.

49
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:33,028
We're a stone's throw away
from one of the giants of literature.

50
00:02:33,358 --> 00:02:34,871
Not the way you throw.

51
00:02:36,111 --> 00:02:37,544
Oh, Niles, this is incredible.

52
00:02:37,779 --> 00:02:40,737
My God, the man's entire life is
shrouded in mystery, yet there he is.

53
00:02:41,032 --> 00:02:42,181
I've always idolized him.

54
00:02:42,408 --> 00:02:44,046
What I wouldn't give
to meet that man.

55
00:02:44,327 --> 00:02:45,760
Why don't you go introduce yourself.

56
00:02:46,037 --> 00:02:48,187
Oh, I can't just walk up
to a god like that.

57
00:02:48,498 --> 00:02:50,090
Well, then find a subtler way.

58
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:52,935
In your vernacular, that would
be what? To slingshot your panties

59
00:02:53,211 --> 00:02:54,360
across the street?

60
00:02:54,796 --> 00:02:57,947
- Foam blower.
- All right, all right, you two.

61
00:02:59,175 --> 00:03:00,494
Niles, she happens to be right.

62
00:03:00,969 --> 00:03:03,358
How often do you get an opportunity
like this? Let's go.

63
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,238
All right.

64
00:03:05,473 --> 00:03:07,270
- Come on, we're going.
- Why? What's the rush?

65
00:03:07,517 --> 00:03:09,269
- T.H. Houghton is across the street.
- Who?

66
00:03:09,561 --> 00:03:12,633
- Come on, let's-- Let's go!
- Hey, guy with a cane here!

67
00:03:20,822 --> 00:03:23,131
Niles, I thought you said you saw
Houghton come in here.

68
00:03:23,408 --> 00:03:26,241
Well, I'm sorry if my tracking skills
aren't up to your standard.

69
00:03:26,578 --> 00:03:28,011
Instead of asking for a baby brother,

70
00:03:28,246 --> 00:03:30,840
you should have asked for a
German short-haired pointer.

71
00:03:31,374 --> 00:03:32,363
I did.

72
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:35,768
Well, I'm sorry.

73
00:03:36,004 --> 00:03:37,483
He must still be out on the street.

74
00:03:37,756 --> 00:03:39,394
I'm parking it.
They got the Mariners on.

75
00:03:39,632 --> 00:03:42,021
- Please, we can't waste time.
- Let him be. He's deadweight.

76
00:03:42,343 --> 00:03:43,332
Right.

77
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:50,450
- What's the score?
- Four to three, Mariners.

78
00:03:51,394 --> 00:03:52,713
Aw!

79
00:03:53,438 --> 00:03:56,430
- How could he miss the cut-off man?
- That man makes 7 million a year.

80
00:03:56,733 --> 00:03:58,052
- It's crazy.
- Yeah.

81
00:03:58,276 --> 00:04:02,110
See him scratching his butt?
That's about 5 grand right there.

82
00:04:02,781 --> 00:04:05,341
- Let me have a Ballantine's.
- Yeah, make it two.

83
00:04:05,784 --> 00:04:07,502
Aw!

84
00:04:10,413 --> 00:04:12,449
So that's your favorite character?

85
00:04:12,707 --> 00:04:13,856
- Really?
- Yeah.

86
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:17,356
Yeah, I really like him. The kind of guy
you can just sit and have a beer with.

87
00:04:17,712 --> 00:04:21,671
Well, I could see you saying that
about Hoss, but Little Joe?

88
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:25,398
That's the great thing about <i>Bonanza</i>.
Something for everyone.

89
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:29,755
Well, thank you, Mr. False Alarm.

90
00:04:30,016 --> 00:04:31,927
"Oh, look, there he is,
over at the yogurt store!

91
00:04:32,185 --> 00:04:34,176
Oh, look, there he is,
in the futon store!

92
00:04:34,437 --> 00:04:36,905
Oh, look, there he is with Dad!"

93
00:04:38,024 --> 00:04:39,616
And now he's leaving.

94
00:04:39,901 --> 00:04:41,619
I must tell him what an impact
his book has made.

95
00:04:41,861 --> 00:04:43,374
Aren't you afraid
it'll sound unoriginal?

96
00:04:43,613 --> 00:04:44,807
- Why?
- I'm gonna say it first.

97
00:04:45,031 --> 00:04:46,703
- Excuse me, Mr. Houghton?
- Yeah?

98
00:04:46,991 --> 00:04:50,620
- I just wanted to tell you that...
- My book changed your life. Swell.

99
00:04:51,246 --> 00:04:53,714
- No, no, but I...
- It changed mine too. Look, I'm sorry.

100
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,759
I don't like to discuss my work.

101
00:04:59,129 --> 00:05:00,881
Well, that was humiliating.

102
00:05:01,131 --> 00:05:02,849
I've never felt so rejected in my life.

103
00:05:03,133 --> 00:05:04,407
Now, now, don't take it so hard.

104
00:05:04,634 --> 00:05:06,033
Who was to know
he was so sensitive?

105
00:05:06,302 --> 00:05:09,772
- Aren't you Dr. Crane from the radio?
- Not now, haven't got the time, sorry.

106
00:05:11,307 --> 00:05:13,138
Do you realize who you were
just talking to?

107
00:05:13,393 --> 00:05:15,065
- That was T.H. Houghton.
- Yeah, I know.

108
00:05:15,353 --> 00:05:17,423
Well, well, well,
what did you two talk about?

109
00:05:17,689 --> 00:05:19,964
- Oh, I don't know. This and that.
- Dad,

110
00:05:20,275 --> 00:05:22,311
virtually nothing is known
about this man.

111
00:05:22,569 --> 00:05:24,002
Can't you give us
something specific?

112
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:28,477
Well, it was just guy stuff, you know.
Baseball, TV shows, old war stories...

113
00:05:28,867 --> 00:05:30,266
- He told war stories?
- No, I did.

114
00:05:30,493 --> 00:05:33,053
You know, about the time I made
the stew and the platoon got sick.

115
00:05:33,329 --> 00:05:34,967
Dad, how could you?

116
00:05:35,248 --> 00:05:36,761
What? He liked it.

117
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,230
He's a nice guy. I think maybe
I'll buy one of his books.

118
00:05:39,544 --> 00:05:42,775
Not books, Dad. Book.

119
00:05:43,089 --> 00:05:44,078
Book.

120
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,934
He wrote one book
and never wrote again.

121
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,899
If only we'd arrived ten minutes earlier,
we could've talked to him.

122
00:05:50,221 --> 00:05:52,416
We could have explored
that mammoth intellect.

123
00:05:52,724 --> 00:05:56,433
Can you imagine the torture the man's
endured, to peak at such an early age?

124
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:59,443
Oh, my God, Frasier, look.
It's a doodle!

125
00:05:59,731 --> 00:06:01,244
Not just any doodle,
a Houghton doodle.

126
00:06:01,524 --> 00:06:02,513
- It's mine!
- No, mine!

127
00:06:02,734 --> 00:06:04,247
- It's mine.
- Dad, what do you care?

128
00:06:04,527 --> 00:06:05,562
No, I mean I drew it.

129
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:10,791
That's very touching. This is for you.

130
00:06:11,075 --> 00:06:12,349
Bye-bye.

131
00:06:14,496 --> 00:06:16,452
I don't know when I've enjoyed
an exhibit more.

132
00:06:16,706 --> 00:06:20,221
The artist's choice to make that a
monochrome was a stroke of genius.

133
00:06:20,585 --> 00:06:22,621
- It conveyed such despair.
- Yes.

134
00:06:22,921 --> 00:06:25,640
It was so refreshing
to see a sad peach.

135
00:06:26,674 --> 00:06:27,948
How about that curator?

136
00:06:28,218 --> 00:06:29,617
She was kind of a peach herself.

137
00:06:30,261 --> 00:06:32,570
- No cubism there, I don't think.
- No, certainly not.

138
00:06:34,265 --> 00:06:36,620
- Hey, boys.
- Oh, hi, Dad.

139
00:06:37,227 --> 00:06:39,263
Oh, Ted. Ted, I'd like you
to meet my sons.

140
00:06:39,521 --> 00:06:41,398
This is Frasier and Niles.
They're big fans.

141
00:06:41,648 --> 00:06:43,366
- Hi, guys.
- Mr. Houghton...

142
00:06:43,608 --> 00:06:45,007
We...

143
00:06:45,735 --> 00:06:47,612
Words can't express...

144
00:06:47,904 --> 00:06:49,895
I guess not.

145
00:06:51,324 --> 00:06:53,201
Nice meeting you fellas.

146
00:06:54,119 --> 00:06:57,907
Oh, my God, we missed him again!

147
00:06:58,289 --> 00:06:59,688
- What's going on?
- That's odd.

148
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:01,789
So where are you two going?

149
00:07:03,086 --> 00:07:05,839
Well, Ted's taking me out to this
bratwurst place he knows.

150
00:07:06,172 --> 00:07:08,925
Bratwurst? Yummy.
My God, that's our favorite.

151
00:07:09,551 --> 00:07:11,030
Nice meeting you.

152
00:07:14,097 --> 00:07:16,565
- What's wrong with this thing?
- Well, it could be broken.

153
00:07:16,891 --> 00:07:19,007
If you came in to the apartment,
we'll call the front--

154
00:07:19,269 --> 00:07:22,864
No! I'm sure it'll work this time.

155
00:07:28,194 --> 00:07:29,991
What the hell was he doing here?

156
00:07:31,489 --> 00:07:33,684
We might know if you hadn't
spent an hour

157
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:36,832
pondering the despair of the peach.

158
00:07:37,287 --> 00:07:38,606
From the man who spent 30 minutes

159
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:41,549
looking at
<i>Woman with a Rectangular Head</i>.

160
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:44,264
Oh, was Mrs. Foster
in the lobby again?

161
00:07:45,003 --> 00:07:46,118
No, Daphne.

162
00:07:46,379 --> 00:07:47,528
Could you explain to me

163
00:07:47,756 --> 00:07:50,429
just how T.H. Houghton
ended up in my apartment?

164
00:07:50,717 --> 00:07:52,708
Well, he's only in town
for a couple of days,

165
00:07:52,969 --> 00:07:54,607
and he doesn't know
too many people,

166
00:07:54,846 --> 00:07:56,962
so he looked your father up,
gave him a ring,

167
00:07:57,223 --> 00:08:00,181
and Mr. Crane invited him over
to watch the Mariners game.

168
00:08:01,352 --> 00:08:03,024
- He was here all afternoon?
- Yes.

169
00:08:03,313 --> 00:08:05,190
Oh, it's a shame you
couldn't be here,

170
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,352
because he told
the most fascinating stories.

171
00:08:08,651 --> 00:08:11,961
And, of course, he and your father
are getting on like old chums.

172
00:08:12,322 --> 00:08:14,552
But the sweetest thing
was how he took to Eddie.

173
00:08:18,286 --> 00:08:20,117
He-- He spent time with Eddie?

174
00:08:20,413 --> 00:08:21,812
Fed him his afternoon biscuit.

175
00:08:22,082 --> 00:08:24,312
- Will the madness never end!
- Oh, now, now.

176
00:08:24,584 --> 00:08:27,337
Let's not give up hope. Maybe
Dad'll bring him back after dinner.

177
00:08:27,629 --> 00:08:29,540
Oh, well, I doubt it.

178
00:08:29,798 --> 00:08:32,710
They'll probably run into J.D. Salinger
and Salman Rushdie

179
00:08:33,009 --> 00:08:34,886
and go out for margaritas.

180
00:08:36,554 --> 00:08:39,227
I tell you, Niles, these near misses,
they're just excruciating.

181
00:08:40,767 --> 00:08:44,043
There you go,
Mr. Houghton. You're welcome.

182
00:08:45,605 --> 00:08:47,755
- Was that him?
- Yes, he forgot his coat.

183
00:08:48,066 --> 00:08:49,624
Make way, Daphne!

184
00:08:53,822 --> 00:08:56,461
We missed him again.

185
00:09:00,286 --> 00:09:04,484
Don't you dare gloat,
you miserable little biscuit whore.

186
00:09:16,678 --> 00:09:18,270
Thanks, Eddie.

187
00:09:31,151 --> 00:09:33,142
- Afternoon, Daphne.
- Hello.

188
00:09:33,403 --> 00:09:34,916
Good dog.

189
00:09:37,282 --> 00:09:40,160
Oh, Dr. Crane,
it's a good thing you're home.

190
00:09:40,452 --> 00:09:44,001
Mr. Houghton's dropping by to pick up
your father for the Mariners game.

191
00:09:44,372 --> 00:09:47,808
- Are you serious? He's coming back?
- Yes, any minute. It's a double-header.

192
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:51,565
- They play two games.
- Oh, right.

193
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,956
But this is-- This is incredibly
good fortune for me.

194
00:09:56,259 --> 00:09:59,331
I'll finally get to spend some time alone
with the man, even for a few minutes.

195
00:10:01,723 --> 00:10:03,554
Daphne, be a dear
and stall Dad, will you.

196
00:10:03,808 --> 00:10:06,686
If he gives you any trouble,
just hide his cane.

197
00:10:07,604 --> 00:10:08,832
Niles!

198
00:10:09,063 --> 00:10:10,815
What fortuitous timing.

199
00:10:11,107 --> 00:10:12,506
The wine shop called a moment ago.

200
00:10:12,734 --> 00:10:15,123
They're down to their last cases
of the '82 Chambolle-Musigny.

201
00:10:15,403 --> 00:10:17,598
Why don't you dash down
before somebody snaps it all up.

202
00:10:17,906 --> 00:10:19,817
Bless you, Frasier. Hold it.

203
00:10:23,953 --> 00:10:27,104
You know very well that in 1982,
there was a drought in Bourgogne.

204
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:32,519
The locals dubbed it
the "Year of the Raisin."

205
00:10:36,049 --> 00:10:39,280
And that wine was never sold
by the case, only by the bottle.

206
00:10:40,762 --> 00:10:42,878
T.H. Houghton is here, isn't he?

207
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:45,982
- No.
- Fine.

208
00:10:46,226 --> 00:10:49,377
Then you won't mind if I just
hang around for a while.

209
00:10:49,687 --> 00:10:51,518
Oh, all right. He's on his way.

210
00:10:51,773 --> 00:10:53,684
He and Dad are going
to a baseball game.

211
00:10:53,942 --> 00:10:55,057
It's a double-header.

212
00:10:56,194 --> 00:10:58,025
They play two games.

213
00:11:00,824 --> 00:11:01,813
Oh, hi, Niles.

214
00:11:02,033 --> 00:11:05,105
Oh, Dad, so I hear that
Mr. Houghton is on his way over.

215
00:11:05,453 --> 00:11:06,886
Maybe we could all have lunch.

216
00:11:07,163 --> 00:11:09,597
- That's a splendid idea.
- No, the game starts in 45 minutes.

217
00:11:09,874 --> 00:11:11,705
Perhaps you could come by
after for a drink.

218
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,871
No, sorry, that won't work either.

219
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:16,923
He's gotta go to his publisher's,
drop off his new book.

220
00:11:18,633 --> 00:11:19,622
Houghton has a new book?

221
00:11:19,884 --> 00:11:21,875
I've lost the feeling in my legs.

222
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,978
Well, did he say anything about it?
I mean, the characters, the setting?

223
00:11:30,311 --> 00:11:32,905
- No, he just said it was a book.
- Dad.

224
00:11:33,189 --> 00:11:34,304
You have to skip the game.

225
00:11:34,524 --> 00:11:35,673
It's not just for our benefit.

226
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,937
After all this baseball, the man must
be starved for intellectual stimulation.

227
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:40,314
I know what you're saying.

228
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:42,760
That someone like that would
prefer to spend time with you

229
00:11:43,032 --> 00:11:44,750
instead of some dumbbell like me.

230
00:11:45,034 --> 00:11:47,343
Dad, you're not dumb.
You missed the point entirely.

231
00:11:47,954 --> 00:11:50,149
Let's just say, for example,
you came home one afternoon

232
00:11:50,415 --> 00:11:52,451
and I was sitting here
discussing literature with,

233
00:11:52,709 --> 00:11:54,506
I don't know, give me the name
of a player.

234
00:11:54,919 --> 00:11:57,877
- Darryl Strawberry.
- No, a real one!

235
00:11:58,798 --> 00:12:00,754
Frasier, the problem is
you push too hard.

236
00:12:01,009 --> 00:12:03,648
We just talk sports,
have a few laughs. That's all.

237
00:12:05,138 --> 00:12:06,969
You know,
I never ask him about his work.

238
00:12:07,223 --> 00:12:09,339
That's probably why he told me
about the book.

239
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,550
- Mr. Houghton, hello.
- Hi, how you doing?

240
00:12:15,857 --> 00:12:18,052
- Hey, Ted, come on in.
- Fine.

241
00:12:18,318 --> 00:12:20,593
So you two boys are
off to the baseball game, huh?

242
00:12:21,196 --> 00:12:22,311
Double-header.

243
00:12:22,572 --> 00:12:24,130
That's two games.

244
00:12:26,826 --> 00:12:28,179
Yeah.

245
00:12:29,162 --> 00:12:30,914
Little-known fact about baseball.

246
00:12:31,331 --> 00:12:35,563
The owner of the Boston Red Sox sold
Babe Ruth to the New York Yankees

247
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:39,275
to finance a Broadway musical,
<i>No, No, Nanette</i>.

248
00:12:42,592 --> 00:12:45,345
- You ready, Marty?
- Let's go.

249
00:12:46,179 --> 00:12:48,135
Well, I really enjoyed chatting
with you.

250
00:12:48,389 --> 00:12:52,268
If you'd drop back by after the game,
we could pick up where we left off.

251
00:12:53,186 --> 00:12:55,620
<i>No, No, Nanette</i>?

252
00:12:58,108 --> 00:12:59,985
I'm sorry,
there were exactly two things

253
00:13:00,235 --> 00:13:02,430
I could possibly add
to a baseball conversation.

254
00:13:02,695 --> 00:13:04,174
That and--

255
00:13:04,447 --> 00:13:06,119
No, just the one.

256
00:13:10,495 --> 00:13:12,531
- Frasier?
- Yes.

257
00:13:12,956 --> 00:13:15,993
Have you noticed how Houghton carries
a satchel with him wherever he goes?

258
00:13:16,334 --> 00:13:19,007
Well, actually,
as a matter of fact, I have, yes.

259
00:13:19,337 --> 00:13:21,897
Didn't Dad mention that Houghton
was on his way to his publisher's

260
00:13:22,173 --> 00:13:24,209
after the game
with a new manuscript?

261
00:13:24,509 --> 00:13:25,498
Yes.

262
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,036
Wouldn't that be the very same satchel
which is now resting under my head?

263
00:13:30,515 --> 00:13:32,346
Oh, my God!

264
00:13:33,309 --> 00:13:35,140
- Wait!
- Should we?

265
00:13:35,979 --> 00:13:37,128
We shouldn't.

266
00:13:37,397 --> 00:13:39,513
- Could we live with ourselves if we did?
- Could we live with ourselves

267
00:13:39,774 --> 00:13:41,366
- if we didn't?
- Could we live either way?

268
00:13:41,651 --> 00:13:43,243
Oh, stop it, Niles!

269
00:13:43,528 --> 00:13:45,166
Oh, who are we kidding? All right.

270
00:13:45,447 --> 00:13:47,438
Careful, careful, careful.

271
00:14:00,044 --> 00:14:04,515
"<i>The Chameleon's Song</i>
by T.H. Houghton."

272
00:14:06,468 --> 00:14:08,220
These are handwritten corrections.

273
00:14:08,511 --> 00:14:11,150
Frasier, this is his
original manuscript.

274
00:14:11,473 --> 00:14:13,907
Shame on you!

275
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:18,461
Going through someone else's
personal property.

276
00:14:18,813 --> 00:14:20,724
Well, it's just plain wrong.

277
00:14:21,024 --> 00:14:22,776
And I know your father
wouldn't approve.

278
00:14:23,067 --> 00:14:25,501
Of course, I wouldn't be here
to tell him if I had the day off.

279
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,651
- Fine, go.
- Oh, great.

280
00:14:31,951 --> 00:14:35,466
Of course, having a day off
is pretty meaningless

281
00:14:35,789 --> 00:14:37,507
when you have no money to,
you know,

282
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:40,783
maybe go to lunch
or do some shopping.

283
00:14:41,294 --> 00:14:44,969
Perhaps take in a show. Oh, thanks.

284
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:50,592
- All right, Niles, shall we?
- Not yet.

285
00:14:50,887 --> 00:14:53,162
- The atmosphere has to be perfect.
- Good point, yes.

286
00:14:53,431 --> 00:14:55,501
Let's begin with the lighting.

287
00:14:55,767 --> 00:14:57,723
All right, just say when.

288
00:14:59,104 --> 00:15:00,696
Warmer.

289
00:15:01,523 --> 00:15:02,797
Warmer.

290
00:15:03,942 --> 00:15:05,500
A little cooler.

291
00:15:06,069 --> 00:15:07,582
A touch warmer.

292
00:15:07,862 --> 00:15:09,454
A hair back.

293
00:15:09,864 --> 00:15:12,583
No, no, just--
No, a hair the other way.

294
00:15:12,909 --> 00:15:15,946
No, a touch warmer.

295
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:18,979
- Perfect.
- Good.

296
00:15:23,169 --> 00:15:26,639
Excellent, excellent. What wine
would most enhance the experience?

297
00:15:26,965 --> 00:15:29,399
No, Niles.
Wine might dull our faculties.

298
00:15:29,676 --> 00:15:34,386
Perhaps instead a slow-sipping cordial
would be the proper garnish.

299
00:15:34,806 --> 00:15:36,762
- Sherry.
- Armagnac.

300
00:15:37,434 --> 00:15:40,232
Oh, well, see?
That's why you're the older brother.

301
00:15:51,906 --> 00:15:55,103
- What is it?
- I don't think you're there yet.

302
00:16:24,147 --> 00:16:25,375
Well, it's a masterpiece.

303
00:16:26,816 --> 00:16:28,374
Eddie.

304
00:16:28,651 --> 00:16:30,289
I never thought I'd utter these words,

305
00:16:30,528 --> 00:16:33,759
but it actually surpasses
<i>Time Flies Tomorrow</i>.

306
00:16:35,533 --> 00:16:37,125
Eddie, please!

307
00:16:37,619 --> 00:16:39,689
We're trying to savor the moment.

308
00:16:51,883 --> 00:16:53,760
How was the game?

309
00:16:55,553 --> 00:16:56,668
Is that my manuscript?

310
00:16:56,888 --> 00:16:58,162
What the hell's going on?

311
00:16:58,431 --> 00:16:59,910
You went through my bag?

312
00:17:00,183 --> 00:17:03,141
- That's my personal property.
- I don't believe you two.

313
00:17:04,312 --> 00:17:07,987
Mr. Houghton, we--
We are terribly, terribly sorry.

314
00:17:08,316 --> 00:17:10,068
The temptation to read it
was just too great.

315
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:11,956
Oh, what's that supposed to mean?

316
00:17:12,195 --> 00:17:14,345
You're grown men,
at least I thought you were.

317
00:17:14,614 --> 00:17:16,730
You had no right to touch that.

318
00:17:16,991 --> 00:17:19,346
Ted, I'm sorry.
I'm just so ashamed.

319
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:21,450
- Now, it's all right.
- No, it's not all right.

320
00:17:21,704 --> 00:17:23,456
No, no, it's okay, really.

321
00:17:23,706 --> 00:17:26,061
Somebody had to read it first.

322
00:17:27,043 --> 00:17:29,841
So, what did you think?

323
00:17:30,755 --> 00:17:32,791
- Of the book?
- No, of my typing.

324
00:17:33,049 --> 00:17:34,482
Yes, of course, the book.

325
00:17:39,431 --> 00:17:40,500
It was great.

326
00:17:42,016 --> 00:17:43,244
Wow.

327
00:17:45,145 --> 00:17:48,296
Well, at least you liked it.
I'm gonna have to be running.

328
00:17:48,648 --> 00:17:50,320
Are you sure?
I was gonna make some coffee.

329
00:17:50,608 --> 00:17:52,644
No, no, I got an appointment.
Can I use the...?

330
00:17:52,944 --> 00:17:54,696
- It's right here.
- Okay.

331
00:17:57,615 --> 00:17:59,287
Boy, I've had it with you guys.

332
00:17:59,576 --> 00:18:01,407
If you were Hoss and Little Joe,

333
00:18:01,661 --> 00:18:06,337
Ben Cartwright would kick your sorry
butts right off the Ponderosa!

334
00:18:07,167 --> 00:18:08,520
Dad.

335
00:18:11,463 --> 00:18:13,101
Dad, we're sorry.

336
00:18:13,339 --> 00:18:14,408
Very sorry.

337
00:18:18,762 --> 00:18:21,230
He's back on the Cartwrights again.

338
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:25,530
You know, someday we really should
ask him just who the hell they are.

339
00:18:27,896 --> 00:18:31,571
You know, Niles, one thing
just really bugs me.

340
00:18:31,941 --> 00:18:35,138
Houghton's gonna leave thinking we're
just a couple of inarticulate simpletons.

341
00:18:35,445 --> 00:18:37,879
What were those pithy comments
we made about his masterpiece?

342
00:18:38,198 --> 00:18:40,473
- "It was great."
- "Wow."

343
00:18:40,742 --> 00:18:43,939
Yes, we'll go down in history with the
same boob who first read <i>Hamlet</i>,

344
00:18:44,245 --> 00:18:48,079
then told Shakespeare, "My goodness,
what a parchment-turner!"

345
00:18:49,334 --> 00:18:51,564
Well, it's not too late.
He hasn't left yet.

346
00:18:52,378 --> 00:18:54,846
Yes, yes, we could still say
something to show him

347
00:18:55,131 --> 00:18:57,691
that we appreciated the
full complexity of his work.

348
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:02,688
Mr. Houghton, you know,
there is one further thing

349
00:19:02,972 --> 00:19:05,042
- I'd like to add about your book.
- Yeah.

350
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:07,910
Well, it's the way you modulated
into the second-person narrative

351
00:19:08,186 --> 00:19:11,861
during the flashback scene. Frankly,
beggars anything Faulkner attempted.

352
00:19:12,232 --> 00:19:14,063
Really? That's very flattering.

353
00:19:14,859 --> 00:19:16,929
Oh, wait, I have one too.

354
00:19:17,737 --> 00:19:19,329
The way you so skillfully mirrored

355
00:19:19,572 --> 00:19:21,688
the structure of Dante's
<i>Divine Comedy</i> was inspired.

356
00:19:22,158 --> 00:19:23,147
Really?

357
00:19:23,368 --> 00:19:25,199
Yes, from the inferno of the bordello--

358
00:19:25,453 --> 00:19:27,967
Which, we noticed,
had exactly nine rooms.

359
00:19:28,289 --> 00:19:30,962
--to the purgatory
of the assembly line,

360
00:19:31,251 --> 00:19:34,448
and finally to the paradise
of the farm.

361
00:19:35,505 --> 00:19:36,858
You both saw that?

362
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:38,648
Oh, it practically jumped
off the page.

363
00:19:38,883 --> 00:19:41,192
Well, that's very perceptive of you.

364
00:19:41,511 --> 00:19:43,786
Well, thank you.
I guess it's our turn to be flattered.

365
00:19:44,097 --> 00:19:46,133
You're absolutely right.

366
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:48,992
This whole book is crap.

367
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:50,299
Beg your pardon?

368
00:19:50,562 --> 00:19:51,881
How could I be so blind?

369
00:19:52,105 --> 00:19:55,142
I lifted the entire structure
from Dante!

370
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:58,528
- You mean you weren't going for that?
- Of course not!

371
00:19:58,862 --> 00:20:00,853
This confirms my worst fear.

372
00:20:01,156 --> 00:20:03,386
I have nothing original left to say.

373
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,019
I'm an empty shell.

374
00:20:05,285 --> 00:20:07,321
I was a fool to think I had
a second book in me!

375
00:20:07,579 --> 00:20:10,218
"The winters were harsh
on the farm."

376
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:13,691
Well, here's something
to warm them up!

377
00:20:14,002 --> 00:20:15,594
What's going on here?

378
00:20:15,837 --> 00:20:16,826
You're both right.

379
00:20:17,088 --> 00:20:19,204
I'm a talentless hack
who got lucky once.

380
00:20:19,507 --> 00:20:21,702
- We didn't say that!
- You're not listening to them?

381
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:24,570
- Look at this trash! It won't burn!
- It's a fireplace, you see.

382
00:20:24,846 --> 00:20:27,724
- It's not well ventilated.
- This doesn't belong in a fireplace.

383
00:20:28,433 --> 00:20:32,062
It belongs in the gutter,
with the rest of society's garbage!

384
00:20:32,395 --> 00:20:34,545
- Wait. No, no--
- Ted, don't do that!

385
00:20:34,814 --> 00:20:37,408
- Ted, no! Don't do it!
- No, Mr. Houghton--

386
00:20:43,948 --> 00:20:45,586
I want to thank you two.

387
00:20:45,992 --> 00:20:49,302
If I had published that book, my
reputation would have been destroyed.

388
00:20:49,621 --> 00:20:53,250
At least now I'm left
with a shred of dignity.

389
00:20:56,127 --> 00:20:57,446
No.

390
00:20:58,088 --> 00:20:59,487
Happy?

391
00:20:59,714 --> 00:21:01,705
Hey, Ted, wait up!

392
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:13,172
Well, we've destroyed a man's life.

393
00:21:13,895 --> 00:21:18,093
Not to mention depriving
future generations of a work of art.

394
00:21:18,441 --> 00:21:20,716
Yes, well, on the other hand,
had he actually published it,

395
00:21:20,985 --> 00:21:24,978
the critics surely would've noticed
that Dante parallel.

396
00:21:25,907 --> 00:21:28,182
If he felt bad now, imagine how
he would've felt reading it

397
00:21:28,451 --> 00:21:30,919
- in <i>The New York Review of Books</i>.
- Oh, God, yes.

398
00:21:31,246 --> 00:21:33,840
Given his fragile ego, my God,
he would've been devastated.

399
00:21:34,124 --> 00:21:35,876
Who knows what
he might have done.

400
00:21:37,585 --> 00:21:39,064
Do you know, Niles,

401
00:21:39,629 --> 00:21:41,779
we saved that man's life.

402
00:21:42,966 --> 00:21:45,400
Yes, I think you're right.

403
00:21:46,594 --> 00:21:49,313
- On the other hand--
- Don't go there.

404
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:55,183
See, that's why
you're the older brother.
