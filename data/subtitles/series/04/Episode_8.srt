1
00:00:10,093 --> 00:00:11,367
Look, we had an agreement.

2
00:00:11,594 --> 00:00:14,586
We went to a movie I wanted to see,
so I was supposed to pay for the ticket.

3
00:00:14,889 --> 00:00:17,926
Very well, Dad. The next time we go
to a Jean-Claude Van Damme movie,

4
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:19,906
not only may you pay for the tickets,

5
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:24,297
but also for the wild horses
it will take to drag me there.

6
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:26,765
Well, I'm only mad because
we had an agreement.

7
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:29,143
Now, a man's supposed to honor
his agreements.

8
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:30,996
Didn't you learn anything
from that movie?

9
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:32,877
Only that bullets are useless
against a man

10
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:35,027
who can kick really high.

11
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:40,207
Now, look, I'm serious about this.
Once in a while, I'd like to pay.

12
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:41,571
- Okay.
- Okay.

13
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:44,351
So the next time we go anywhere,
it's on me. Have I made my point?

14
00:00:44,669 --> 00:00:47,058
Yes, Dad, with all the subtlety
that Mr. Van Damme displayed

15
00:00:47,339 --> 00:00:51,457
when he jet-packed into the Vatican to
subdue that nasty old pope impostor.

16
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:53,834
Like you saw that coming.

17
00:00:55,347 --> 00:00:57,815
Well, Maris has finally deigned
to call me back,

18
00:00:58,099 --> 00:00:59,691
after I've left no fewer than
20 messages.

19
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:03,324
Honestly, Niles, by calling her so many
times, you give her all the power.

20
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:06,001
You're much better off coming
from a position of strength.

21
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:08,629
Don't pour that sherry on your shirt.
It will stain.

22
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:10,843
- What?
- I'm sorry.

23
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,868
I thought this was
the portion of the afternoon

24
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:15,025
where we gave each
other patently obvious advice.

25
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:19,420
I had to call Maris for that party I'm
throwing for my country club friends.

26
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:22,465
Oh, yes, the one I wasn't invited to
but my Waterford punchbowl was.

27
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:26,628
Yes, well, Maris has chosen the same
night to throw a party of her own.

28
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:28,994
- Couldn't you ask her to postpone?
- I tried.

29
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:32,846
She's already flown in a sculptor from
Sweden to capture her likeness in ice.

30
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:37,340
Ah, the perfect marriage
of subject and medium.

31
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:40,509
Well, you can see my problem.

32
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:43,565
We're going to be competing now
for which friends go to which party.

33
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:47,129
You know, Niles, for a separated
couple still hoping to reconcile,

34
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,158
I'm afraid you're going down
a path that--

35
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:51,876
You shouldn't wear that tie
with that jacket.

36
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:56,662
Oh, is that your clever way of telling
me I'm dispensing unwanted criticism?

37
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:58,102
That too.

38
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,292
- Hello, boys.
- Hello, Daphne.

39
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:05,258
Oh, Dr. Crane. Will you be
joining us for dinner?

40
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:09,501
- What a nice invitation. I'd love to.
- Well, then, you're in for a treat.

41
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:13,076
I've decided to make Grammy Moon's
famous sheep's head stew.

42
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:15,988
Oh, don't worry,
the name's a bit misleading.

43
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:18,372
It's actually more of a soup.

44
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:22,726
You actually use a real sheep's head?

45
00:02:23,018 --> 00:02:27,091
- Oh, you have to. It's right in here.
- Oh, my God! I just remembered,

46
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:29,157
we have reservations
at Le Cigare Volant!

47
00:02:29,441 --> 00:02:33,036
- Oh, my God, you're right!
- Gee, is that tonight? I nearly forgot.

48
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:35,712
- You're going too, Mr. Crane?
- Well, I promised the boys.

49
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,822
I don't suppose there's any way
you guys would let me out of this.

50
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:40,516
- Well...
- You promised.

51
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:42,662
See, I tried.

52
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:45,745
Well, have fun.
I'm off to stick my head in the oven.

53
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:52,987
Hello? Marshall?

54
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:55,682
Yeah, I got rid of them.

55
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:59,926
You bring some wine,
and I'll throw the steaks on.

56
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:12,465
Oh, dear Lord, it's rather busy.
Well, let's keep our fingers crossed.

57
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:15,502
- François!
- Dr. Crane, <i>bonsoir</i>!

58
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:16,928
<i>Bonsoir</i>.

59
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,475
- <i>Bonsoir</i>.
- <i>Bonsoir</i>.

60
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:21,303
This is our father, Martin Crane.

61
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:23,885
- <i>Monsieur Crane</i>!
- How you doing?

62
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:25,929
<i>Enchanté</i>.

63
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:28,492
François, I'm afraid we're
at your mercy tonight.

64
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,342
You see, we have no reservations.

65
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:34,411
- Dr. Crane, I will see what I can do.
- Thank you.

66
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,352
Anything would be just fine.
Thank you.

67
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:37,827
You know, come to think of it,

68
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:41,726
we haven't been here since Chef
Joachim had his pinkie grafted back on.

69
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:45,612
Oh, then this is your first time
seeing our new artwork.

70
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:47,788
He's my own discovery.

71
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,574
His name is Cordoba.

72
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:51,894
- Exquisite!
- Stunning!

73
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:56,263
My God, I don't think I've ever seen
such fearless use of color.

74
00:03:56,653 --> 00:04:01,363
You know, as usual, your taste
is as fine as your cuisine. Any luck?

75
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:05,901
For you, yes. For Dr. Dubin,
who brings his own wine, no.

76
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:08,456
- Good man!
- <i>Monsieur</i>, follow me, please.

77
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:10,538
- <i>Merci bien</i>.
- Your table is ready.

78
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:12,111
- Thank you.
- You guys go ahead.

79
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:16,089
I gotta make a little visit to "<i>le</i> can."

80
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:18,220
- That's our father.
- Doctor.

81
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:20,536
- <i>Le menu</i>.
- <i>Merci</i>.

82
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:23,680
- I will be back with the wine list.
- Lovely.

83
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,249
Wine list?

84
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,718
My God, he ought
to bring us blindfolds.

85
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:30,976
I mean, what is he thinking
with this artwork?

86
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,306
It's appalling.

87
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:34,202
Who was it that said,
"Art in restaurants

88
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:36,511
is on the same level with food
in museums"?

89
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:40,659
The little white lies one will tell
for a good table, huh?

90
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:43,423
Of course, I would compliment
a black velvet Elvis right now

91
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,658
if Chef Joachim's lobster comfit
were at stake.

92
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:50,452
Frasier, that's Winship Cook.

93
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,982
She's one of the guests Maris and I
are competing over.

94
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,575
I'm going to go woo her.

95
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:57,547
Oh, really, Niles, why don't you
just reschedule your party?

96
00:04:57,881 --> 00:05:00,839
I don't want to give her the satisfaction.
She's pushed me around long enough.

97
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:02,404
- All right.
- Metaphorically.

98
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:05,111
In reality, she can hardly push at all.

99
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:07,902
Hence, that terrible afternoon
last spring she spent trapped

100
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:09,855
in the revolving door at Bergdorf's.

101
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:15,543
I hope there's something on there you
like because dinner's on me tonight.

102
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:17,575
- What do you mean, Dad?
- We had an agreement.

103
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:20,854
- Next time we went out, it's my treat.
- Well, Dad, when I said that--

104
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:23,551
- Hup, We're not discussing it.
- Yes, but Dad, it's rather pricey.

105
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,654
- Hup, you promised.
- Well, I-- I just don't--

106
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:28,548
- Hup!
- All right. All right. You treat.

107
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:30,466
Thank you.
Now, don't worry about it.

108
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:32,935
Just order whatever you want.

109
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,865
Is this per person?

110
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:41,098
The wine list, uh, doctor.

111
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,730
Thank you. Thank you, François,
but, you know what,

112
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,523
we won't be having any wine tonight.

113
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:49,114
And I'm going out for
a Big Mac after work.

114
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:51,082
No, I'm really being quite serious.

115
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:53,869
You see, my brother and I are
watching our caloric intake tonight.

116
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:55,214
We'll be eating light.

117
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:57,941
As you wish, doctor.

118
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:01,232
I know what you're doing.
I'm not stupid.

119
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:03,166
- What are you talking about?
- Eating light?

120
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:05,357
All the way here you had the look
that Eddie gets

121
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:07,685
when he hears a can-opener.

122
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:11,128
Look, Dad, it's just that I'm not
that comfortable ordering

123
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:13,210
an expensive meal
when you're paying.

124
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,807
What's the big deal?
You take me to places like this.

125
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:17,802
I can afford it!

126
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:20,244
I'm sorry.

127
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:22,860
I didn't mean that the way
it sounded.

128
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:25,328
- I know how you feel.
- No, you don't.

129
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:27,709
You're always paying,
and I'm never allowed to pay.

130
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:29,165
Well, it feels pretty lousy.

131
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:32,320
- Go ahead, Mr. Big Shot, you pay.
- Dad...

132
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,956
Well, the good news is Winship
has agreed to come to my party.

133
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:39,748
Bad news is I left my wallet at home,
so, Frasier, I'm afraid this is on you.

134
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:43,259
- Actually, tonight's dinner is on Dad.
- No, you ruined it. I'm not paying.

135
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:46,205
- Well, I'm not paying!
- Well, I can't pay.

136
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:51,457
So that would be three
Happy Meals to go?

137
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:57,546
No, he never suspected a thing.

138
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:00,871
Yes, I had a great time too.

139
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:03,321
Oh, go on, Marshall, say it again.

140
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:09,505
Now say it how you said it last night,
like Donald Duck.

141
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:14,108
Well, I guess it was the wine
that made it funny.

142
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:16,595
They're back.
Yeah, I'll see you tonight.

143
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:18,332
Bye.

144
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:20,163
- Hello.
- Oh, hello, Daphne.

145
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,431
Will you be favoring us with
any English delicacies?

146
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:24,205
Well, as a matter of fact, yes.

147
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:28,798
The butcher had some lovely calf
stomachs, so I'll try my hand at haggis.

148
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:32,714
Even Hannibal Lecter couldn't keep
that woman's cooking down.

149
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,442
Hello.

150
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:42,216
Ah, Winship, so looking forward
to seeing you at the party.

151
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,482
Oh, how dreadful.

152
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:46,272
Oh, you poor thing.

153
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,028
No, no, of course I understand.

154
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:49,897
The important thing is
that you get better.

155
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:52,127
And you are a dear for calling.

156
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:55,267
You lying, two-faced cow!

157
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,130
- So she's not really sick?
- Oh, hardly.

158
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:02,110
Maris is luring away
all my confirmed guests.

159
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,431
Suddenly there are accidents,
deaths in the family,

160
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:07,491
a wave of misfortune is sweeping
through society's bluebloods

161
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:10,452
at a rate unprecedented
since the French Revolution.

162
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,050
Oh, great, you're back! Hey, listen,

163
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:16,480
about last night at the restaurant,
I'm really sorry.

164
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:19,382
Oh, no, Dad, look, it was my fault.
I should've been more gracious.

165
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,896
No, no, it was my fault.
I was the one who overreacted.

166
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:25,046
You know, I just really wanted
to do something nice for you.

167
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:29,509
You know, the older you get,
the harder it is to do stuff for your kids.

168
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:32,193
I understand. I tell you what,

169
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,222
the next three dinners,
they're on you.

170
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,391
No, no, no. I found something better
than that.

171
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:39,553
I finally found something I know
you're gonna like. Now, just a minute.

172
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:41,923
Oh, this is gonna be so great!

173
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,868
My God, I haven't seen him
this excited

174
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:46,780
since he got that
four-in-one remote control.

175
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:01,659
It's a Cordoba.

176
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:04,570
<i>Olé!</i>

177
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:07,567
You guys were raving about
these paintings last night,

178
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,307
so I went to the restaurant
to find out where they got theirs.

179
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:12,947
And lucky me, the ones they had
were for sale!

180
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:15,377
Oh, Dad, this is awfully...

181
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:16,957
- ...awfully--
- Expensive.

182
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:19,332
- Yeah!
- Yeah, yeah, but it's worth it.

183
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:22,479
You know, you don't know
how good this makes me feel.

184
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:26,400
After I'm gone, this'll still be here.

185
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:30,357
Hey, Daph, come here!
Take a look at this.

186
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:33,843
Well, I'm very impressed, Mr. Crane.

187
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:36,554
When did you have the time
to do that?

188
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:41,001
Oh, sure, like I could paint
something like this.

189
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:45,601
You know, I was thinking maybe
we could put it over the fireplace.

190
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:49,790
Yes, yes, the fireplace.
That's the first place I thought of too.

191
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:57,479
<i>And lately I've had the chronic</i>
<i>fluctuating mood disturbances</i>

192
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:59,561
<i>that would indicate</i>
<i>cyclothymic disorder.</i>

193
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:01,696
<i>I mean, the hypomanic symptoms</i>
<i>are there,</i>

194
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:03,926
<i>yet I've experienced moments</i>
<i>of aphasia and apraxia.</i>

195
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:07,463
<i>And I just wanna pull my teeth out,</i>
<i>Dr. Crane. What do you think?</i>

196
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:11,687
Well, Greg, two possible diagnoses
come to mind:

197
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:14,538
Either you are seriously mentally ill

198
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:17,940
and you should be institutionalized
immediately,

199
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:20,837
or you are a first-year
psychology student.

200
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:22,679
<i>Oh, yeah, yeah, I'm at UW.</i>

201
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,912
Yes, it's not uncommon
for students to feel that

202
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:28,120
they're manifesting symptoms
that they are studying.

203
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,739
It'll pass.

204
00:10:30,005 --> 00:10:32,599
- <i>What'll I do till it passes?</i>
- Oh, just relax.

205
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:35,032
Well, it might be a good idea
to postpone reading about

206
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:38,771
male sexual disorder
until after spring break.

207
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:46,033
That's all the time we have.
This is Dr. Frasier Crane, KACL-780.

208
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:48,235
- Good show.
- Well, thanks, Roz.

209
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:49,596
Say, Roz,

210
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:52,656
if you're not busy, would you like
to get a drink or something?

211
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:54,704
You know, maybe see a movie?

212
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:56,137
You pick, I'll pay.

213
00:10:56,948 --> 00:11:00,065
You can stay out as late as you want,
but eventually you have to go home,

214
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:02,643
and that painting will still be there.

215
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:06,890
- You have to tell him.
- I can't, Roz.

216
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:09,397
You didn't see the look on his face
when he gave it to me.

217
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,263
Frasier, have I ever told you about
my ceramic hippo collection?

218
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:14,978
- Oh, yes. Many times.
- The hell I have. Shut up and listen.

219
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:19,293
One Christmas my grandma
sent me a ceramic hippo.

220
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:21,826
Roz, a hippo cannot possibly
be as repellent

221
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:25,374
as a rabid matador killing
an epileptic bull.

222
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:28,852
Was the bull wearing a porkpie hat
and fishing off a dock?

223
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,112
- Continue.
- Okay.

224
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,709
I made the mistake of telling her
how much I loved it.

225
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:36,499
Well, that just opened the floodgates.

226
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:39,374
I got ice-skating hippos
and hula-hooping hippos.

227
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:41,727
Thank God for that earthquake!

228
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:45,266
Oh, you mean, you mean they broke?

229
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:48,894
Well, I assume they did when they hit
the bottom of the garbage chute.

230
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:51,670
But I blamed it on the earthquake.

231
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:55,749
The point is you need to talk to your
father now and be honest with him.

232
00:11:56,091 --> 00:11:58,321
Or you'll be stuck with it
till the next natural disaster.

233
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:00,865
Hell, you're right, Roz.

234
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:03,810
I guess I'll just have to tell him
this afternoon.

235
00:12:04,099 --> 00:12:05,088
Good.

236
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:09,381
Oh, Roz, that crystal vase I gave you
three years ago for Christmas,

237
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,606
you said that was broken
in the earthquake.

238
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:15,129
Oh, no, no, no, that really was.
I was very disappointed.

239
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:16,679
As disappointed as you were

240
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:19,622
when Eddie chewed up that sweater
I gave you for Christmas.

241
00:12:21,616 --> 00:12:24,005
- This year, liquor?
- Deal.

242
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:32,726
- Oh, hi, Dad.
- Hey, Fras.

243
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,506
You know, I was just down
in the storage room

244
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,155
putting away some boxes.

245
00:12:38,633 --> 00:12:40,749
Guess what I came across.

246
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:44,840
That-- That smoking jacket I gave you
for Christmas last year.

247
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:48,056
- The shiny one?
- Not shiny, Dad, silk.

248
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:52,454
I really-- I really missed the boat
on that one, didn't I?

249
00:12:52,731 --> 00:12:54,767
You know, it's just, buying things
for other people,

250
00:12:55,025 --> 00:12:57,175
- it's so hard sometimes, isn't it?
- Yeah.

251
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:59,999
Hey, you want some pastrami?
There's some more in the fridge.

252
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:02,357
No, thanks, Dad.
I don't really care for pastrami.

253
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:05,368
Isn't that funny, you know,
you can love something so much,

254
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:08,220
and I would find it distasteful.

255
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:10,673
- People have different tastes.
- Yeah.

256
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:15,489
Well, that's one way of looking at it.
Some people like pastrami, like me,

257
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,353
other people don't. They're nuts.

258
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:21,502
- Afternoon.
- Hey, Niles.

259
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,352
- Hi, Niles.
- Dad, Frasier,

260
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,866
I'm here to pick up the punchbowl
for my party.

261
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:29,097
Although at this point,
a soup bowl might suffice.

262
00:13:34,189 --> 00:13:36,498
Thanks to Maris, I'm down to three
confirmed guests.

263
00:13:36,775 --> 00:13:38,766
Three? Yesterday it was 12, wasn't it?

264
00:13:39,069 --> 00:13:43,187
She's circulating a vicious rumor that
I'm going to have a karaoke machine.

265
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:48,321
You know, this vindictive behavior
of Maris' is completely out of line.

266
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:50,773
If you don't want her
to continue with it, you should

267
00:13:51,081 --> 00:13:53,356
call her on the phone
and confront her.

268
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:56,665
You're absolutely right.

269
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,434
It's time I took the bull by the horns.

270
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,161
Sorry.

271
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:06,638
Maris? Niles.

272
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:08,522
You may feel you've triumphed,

273
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:12,678
but all you've done is shown yourself
to be petty and uncivil.

274
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:15,814
Frankly, the only people
lower than you

275
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:19,742
are the fickle paramecia that deserted
my party to attend yours.

276
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:21,478
Uh-huh.

277
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:24,368
Oh, I see. Very well. Yes.

278
00:14:24,656 --> 00:14:27,329
I'll see you at 8.
Can I bring anything?

279
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:34,537
Thank God
for the starch in that shirt,

280
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,861
or there'd be nothing
holding you upright.

281
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:42,560
Hey, Niles. Here.

282
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:46,829
- Well, what's that?
- It's a wine rack.

283
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:48,847
- Really?
- Yeah.

284
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:51,850
I felt kind of bad about giving Frasier
something and nothing for you,

285
00:14:52,142 --> 00:14:54,098
so I saw it at Price Busters.

286
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:58,068
Well, thank you for
the thought, Dad,

287
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:01,112
but it doesn't really fit in
with the decor of my apartment.

288
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:02,914
Oh. Oh, okay.

289
00:15:03,153 --> 00:15:05,303
Well, no harm done.
I'll take it back.

290
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:07,403
- Anybody want a beer?
- No, thanks.

291
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:09,409
No, thanks, Dad.

292
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:12,908
Frasier, I no longer require
your punchbowl,

293
00:15:13,163 --> 00:15:14,642
but may I borrow your blow dryer?

294
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,063
Of course. Why?

295
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:20,807
Sven finished Maris' ice sculpture, and
she's convinced she looks a bit hippy.

296
00:15:23,757 --> 00:15:24,985
Dad?

297
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:28,333
Are you sure Niles didn't
just hurt your feelings now?

298
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:32,114
No. I'm glad he told me. I don't wanna
give him something he doesn't like.

299
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:34,715
That's very wise.

300
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:37,888
You know, it's important for fathers
and sons to be honest with each other.

301
00:15:38,188 --> 00:15:39,541
It shows respect.

302
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:43,413
You know, I've been thinking, Dad,
about the painting.

303
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:46,169
You know, art,
it's such a personal thing.

304
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:48,038
What one person may like,
another may not.

305
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:50,670
It doesn't mean that one is right
and the other is wrong.

306
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,861
You telling me
you don't like the painting?

307
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:55,997
Well, it's not that I don't like it,
it's just I don't love it.

308
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:57,483
It's not me.

309
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,699
Not a problem. You don't like it,
I'll take it back.

310
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,076
Oh, thank God, Dad, thank you.
That's such a relief.

311
00:16:03,338 --> 00:16:06,694
You know, I was up half the night
worried about it, and I just...

312
00:16:08,343 --> 00:16:09,571
Dad, are you all right?

313
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:12,544
Well, I didn't upset you, did I?

314
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:15,167
My God, Dad, are you crying?

315
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:16,582
No, no.

316
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:19,415
Yes, you are! Yes, you are!
I just saw you wipe your eyes.

317
00:16:19,688 --> 00:16:21,918
No, I didn't. I just...
Quit looking at me!

318
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,669
Dad!

319
00:16:23,942 --> 00:16:25,694
Oh, my God!

320
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:29,739
- I've made my father cry.
- Now, don't you start!

321
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:32,348
Oh, God, I'm only crying
because you're crying.

322
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:34,854
I'm not crying!
I don't know what this is.

323
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,395
I didn't even cry when I got shot.

324
00:16:37,998 --> 00:16:40,876
I didn't cry when you got shot, either.

325
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:44,770
I'm getting rid of that damn
painting right now.

326
00:16:45,046 --> 00:16:48,004
I just wish I knew why you told
the waiter you loved it so much.

327
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:50,218
- I was lying to him!
- Oh, you can lie to him,

328
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:54,586
- but you can't lie to me?!
- Please, please stop crying.

329
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:57,843
- I wanna keep it now.
- No, it's no good.

330
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:00,300
No, no, it is good. It's very good.
I love it!

331
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:03,284
Well, I found that...

332
00:17:06,151 --> 00:17:08,028
Dad, are you crying?

333
00:17:11,114 --> 00:17:12,786
Frasier, what happened?

334
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:15,467
Oh, my God, you're crying too.

335
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:17,741
Why is everybody crying?

336
00:17:18,997 --> 00:17:21,591
You know how I get when other
people cry. Tell me what happened.

337
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:24,749
I made our father cry.

338
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:26,485
I'm not crying!

339
00:17:26,755 --> 00:17:27,949
Well, I am!

340
00:17:28,173 --> 00:17:32,530
- I'm the most ungrateful son there is.
- I can never do anything for my sons.

341
00:17:33,511 --> 00:17:37,140
No one wants to come to my party!

342
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:49,106
Dad?

343
00:17:49,361 --> 00:17:50,396
Frasier.

344
00:17:50,612 --> 00:17:52,728
Don't you think we ought to talk about
what happened?

345
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:54,945
Nothing happened this afternoon.

346
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:56,993
Look, Dad,

347
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:59,313
I know you're disappointed
about the painting.

348
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:00,568
It's not a problem.

349
00:18:00,789 --> 00:18:03,144
Well, look, you said yourself
that it wasn't as easy for you

350
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:05,372
to give me things as it was
when I was a kid.

351
00:18:06,044 --> 00:18:07,636
I wasn't very good at it then either.

352
00:18:07,879 --> 00:18:10,234
Your mother always picked
all your stuff out.

353
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:15,178
Still, you did put a roof over my head,
sent me to school--

354
00:18:15,553 --> 00:18:18,306
All right, all right.
You wanna talk about this?

355
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:20,554
We'll talk about it.

356
00:18:24,562 --> 00:18:26,518
Do people come to you
after they've met me and say,

357
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:29,810
"How can that guy be your father,
he's nothing like you"?

358
00:18:30,235 --> 00:18:31,793
Well...

359
00:18:32,237 --> 00:18:36,071
Because they've been saying that
to me about you for the last 40 years.

360
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:39,929
I just thought,

361
00:18:40,161 --> 00:18:42,038
I don't know,

362
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:44,279
that I'd finally given you something,

363
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:46,971
something you liked,
something we both liked.

364
00:18:48,086 --> 00:18:50,805
Like we had something
in common or something.

365
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:55,051
It's no big deal. I'm tired.
I'm going to bed.

366
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:59,089
Dad, Dad, just hang on a second,
will you?

367
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:02,445
Do you remember a time when I was,

368
00:19:02,726 --> 00:19:06,685
oh, 6 or 7 years old?
You were getting ready for work,

369
00:19:07,022 --> 00:19:12,176
and you were getting dressed,
and I was playing with your badge?

370
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:17,096
And you sat me down and you said
that it was not a toy.

371
00:19:18,533 --> 00:19:22,003
That it was a symbol of something
very important...

372
00:19:22,537 --> 00:19:27,292
...of integrity and honesty
and helping people.

373
00:19:29,377 --> 00:19:34,656
Well, from then on, every time I'd see
you put on that badge, I would,

374
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:37,086
I would think of that.

375
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:43,043
I said it so you'd stop playing with
the thing. You were getting it all sticky.

376
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:44,829
Yeah, well,

377
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:47,615
be that as it may.

378
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:52,943
I've tried to live up to your example,

379
00:19:53,234 --> 00:19:54,713
and help other people.

380
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:58,395
I've tried as a psychiatrist

381
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:04,250
to conduct myself with the integrity
that you showed as a police officer.

382
00:20:04,913 --> 00:20:08,952
And when I find myself in a quandary
as to the proper course of action,

383
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:13,274
I think of you wearing that badge,

384
00:20:14,923 --> 00:20:17,517
and then I know what I have to do.

385
00:20:18,385 --> 00:20:20,057
You gave me that.

386
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:23,829
Yeah?

387
00:20:24,099 --> 00:20:26,294
Yeah, Dad.

388
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:27,912
Thanks.

389
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:30,700
You know,

390
00:20:31,523 --> 00:20:35,721
I think I may have something else
to give you, something that

391
00:20:36,695 --> 00:20:39,084
I know you'll really like.

392
00:20:40,115 --> 00:20:42,071
I'll be back in a minute.

393
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:03,725
I've been holding on to this
for quite a while now,

394
00:21:04,014 --> 00:21:05,970
waiting for the right time.

395
00:21:10,562 --> 00:21:12,632
Oh, my goodness, Dad.

396
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:15,586
I'm speechless.

397
00:21:15,817 --> 00:21:17,216
It's your ba--

398
00:21:19,154 --> 00:21:21,031
Bolo tie!

399
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:29,691
They gave it to your grandfather
when he retired from the force.

400
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,235
When I graduated from the academy,
he gave it to me,

401
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:36,493
and now I'm giving it to you,
and someday you'll give it to Frederick.

402
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:39,886
Well, I don't know what to say.

403
00:21:40,175 --> 00:21:43,292
- You're not gonna start crying again.
- No, no, no.

404
00:21:43,595 --> 00:21:47,065
It's just a surprise, that's all.

405
00:21:50,435 --> 00:21:52,107
Hey, wait a minute.

406
00:21:52,354 --> 00:21:55,027
You didn't think I was gonna give you
my badge, did you?

407
00:21:55,357 --> 00:21:57,587
- Well, I--
- My badge?!

408
00:21:57,901 --> 00:22:01,974
That's a laugh! You'll have to pry that
out of my cold, dead hands!

409
00:22:04,866 --> 00:22:06,902
It's a date!
