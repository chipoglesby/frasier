What are you trying to do?

I'm trying to loop through the fraiser scripts and get all of the lines of the characters.

First, I want to find all of the character lines. Those start with something like
`\w\\:` for example, `Frasier:` to denote when someone is speaking.

We'll create a vector of those using `grep("\\w\\:", frasier2)`.

Second, I want to find all of the empty character vectors. Those will be
the spaces between when someone is talking. We'll create a vector of those using
`grep('^$', frasier2)`.

Third, I want to loop through the chacter line vector, looking at the empty vector as well and then try to create a good format to get the character lines.

In a for loop, loop through characterLines. If the `i` in characterLines is greater than or equal to emptyLines then use the two character lines, `i` and `i + 1`. If the `i` is less than character lines, use `i` and `i - 1`.
