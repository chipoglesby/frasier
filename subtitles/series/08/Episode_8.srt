And yet he left his loving wife

and I don't know.

303
00:16:41,687 --> 00:16:44,759
Yes. Right. Well, listen,
you've got to understand something.

304
00:16:44,967 --> 00:16:46,036
Kenny loves you.

305
00:16:46,207 --> 00:16:49,085
Yes, he was attracted to someone,
but you've got to forgive him for that.

306
00:16:49,247 --> 00:16:50,839
After all, you were attracted to me.

307
00:16:51,047 --> 00:16:53,436
- That was more revenge.
- Ah.

308
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:55,405
Well.

309
00:16:56,167 --> 00:16:59,477
That's neither here nor there.
All right, listen, it was nice to meet you.

310
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:01,239
It was nice to meet you.

311
00:17:01,407 --> 00:17:05,480
I just want to thank you for making
an ordinary housewife feel so...

312
00:17:05,647 --> 00:17:08,286
KENNY: Hey, doc.
- Goodbye.

313
00:17:10,007 --> 00:17:11,520
That anger management's
a load of crap.

314
00:17:11,687 --> 00:17:13,564
Kenny, Kenny.

315
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:16,685
Your wife is not cheating on you.

316
00:17:17,367 --> 00:17:18,482
Don't ask me how I know that.

317
00:17:18,687 --> 00:17:21,599
Maybe it's the hundreds of people
I've counselled over the years.

318
00:17:21,767 --> 00:17:23,439
Maybe it's just a hunch. I don't know.

319
00:17:23,607 --> 00:17:25,916
It's just that,
yes, you two have problems.

320
00:17:26,087 --> 00:17:27,998
But they're the kind of problems
that people have

321
00:17:28,167 --> 00:17:30,476
when they've been in a relationship
for a long time.

322
00:17:30,687 --> 00:17:32,757
All you need to do is talk.

323
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,997
I want you to go home.

324
00:17:35,167 --> 00:17:37,840
I'm sure you'll find your wife there
waiting for you.

325
00:17:38,727 --> 00:17:40,683
I hope you're right.

326
00:17:41,167 --> 00:17:43,635
- Thanks, doc.
- Oh, anytime.

327
00:17:43,807 --> 00:17:45,957
- That's my wife's purse.
- Hm?

328
00:17:47,247 --> 00:17:48,441
That's not your wife's purse.

329
00:17:49,167 --> 00:17:51,556
- Yes, it is.
- No, it's not.

330
00:17:52,047 --> 00:17:53,958
I know my wife's purse.
I got it for her birthday.

331
00:17:54,127 --> 00:17:55,606
Lots of women
can have the same purse.

332
00:17:55,767 --> 00:17:57,962
Well, if it's not hers,
why don't you let me see it?

333
00:18:00,047 --> 00:18:03,562
Kenny,
I've got to tell you something.

334
00:18:03,767 --> 00:18:05,723
It's a little complicated,

335
00:18:05,887 --> 00:18:08,879
and I'm sure that in the future,
we'll all have a good laugh over it.

336
00:18:09,087 --> 00:18:11,647
It's just that, well...

337
00:18:11,807 --> 00:18:13,843
I did not have a date
with Janis tonight.

338
00:18:14,047 --> 00:18:16,322
Well, you had a date with someone.
The wine, the fire...

339
00:18:16,487 --> 00:18:21,117
Yes, yes, I did have a date,
but it was with, uh...

340
00:18:21,327 --> 00:18:23,887
- Roz?
- Exactly.

341
00:18:24,087 --> 00:18:26,555
What are you guys talking about?

342
00:18:30,887 --> 00:18:34,960
Wow, that stuff really works.

343
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:41,484
- Maybe I should wipe some of it off.
- Right. Here, take your purse.

344
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:43,917
Wait, Frasier, what are you talking
about? This isn't my...

345
00:18:47,447 --> 00:18:49,915
I don't wanna know.

346
00:18:57,567 --> 00:18:59,159
You dog.

347
00:19:01,647 --> 00:19:04,161
By the way, doc,
I owe you some chocolates.

348
00:19:04,327 --> 00:19:05,726
I got a little hungry in your room.

349
00:19:05,887 --> 00:19:08,606
I noticed that box of Fanny Farmer's
you got stuck between two books.

350
00:19:08,767 --> 00:19:10,086
Thanks again.

351
00:19:12,687 --> 00:19:15,645
I don't keep chocolate in my room.
Roz, get out here.

352
00:19:15,847 --> 00:19:18,361
Try to control yourself.

353
00:19:23,447 --> 00:19:26,723
Who stashed a box of donuts
behind Eddie's dog food?

354
00:19:27,327 --> 00:19:30,239
- Well, we better get going.
- Okay.

355
00:19:37,447 --> 00:19:39,039
Daphne?

356
00:19:39,207 --> 00:19:41,641
Is there something
you wanna tell me?

357
00:19:41,807 --> 00:19:43,718
I love you?

358
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:45,802
Anything else?

359
00:19:46,967 --> 00:19:49,527
I love chocolate. And pastries.

360
00:19:49,687 --> 00:19:53,157
And, oh, God, I can't stop eating.
I'm out of control.

361
00:19:53,327 --> 00:19:55,761
Come here, come here, come here.
That's all right, my love.

362
00:19:55,927 --> 00:19:59,237
- We're gonna get you through this.
- Of course we will, Daph.

363
00:19:59,447 --> 00:20:01,278
You know, there are professionals
who can help.

364
00:20:01,447 --> 00:20:04,405
Yeah, they can wire your jaw shut,
staple your stomach,

365
00:20:04,607 --> 00:20:07,121
put a balloon in your gut.

366
00:20:07,287 --> 00:20:10,962
Thank you, Dad. I was referring
to something more like a spa, all right?

367
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:13,357
Although you might look
into that jaw thing.

368
00:20:16,967 --> 00:20:19,197
Daphne,
I think a spa is a wonderful idea.

369
00:20:19,367 --> 00:20:22,484
They can oversee your diet
and plan your exercise

370
00:20:22,647 --> 00:20:24,399
and help you understand
why you're overeating.

371
00:20:24,567 --> 00:20:27,161
Yes. Most importantly, Daph,
you should know that we love you.

372
00:20:27,327 --> 00:20:30,922
- And that you're not alone.
- Oh, thank you.

373
00:20:31,687 --> 00:20:33,882
- Roz.
- No. You stay right there.

374
00:20:35,407 --> 00:20:39,241
I don't blame you.
I blame the people at Mantastic.
