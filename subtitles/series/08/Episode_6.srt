ROZ: Frasier, I knew
when you bought me lunch,

2
00:00:10,447 --> 00:00:11,880
there was going to be a catch.

3
00:00:12,047 --> 00:00:14,959
- How long is this gonna take?
- Well, it shouldn't take too long, Roz.

4
00:00:15,127 --> 00:00:17,766
I can't believe I'm actually scouring
a science-fiction convention

5
00:00:17,927 --> 00:00:18,996
for <i>X- Men</i> comics.

6
00:00:19,167 --> 00:00:23,206
I feel I'm contributing
to the decline of my son's intellect.

7
00:00:23,487 --> 00:00:24,681
Then why are you doing it?

8
00:00:24,847 --> 00:00:27,600
Well, because I said no
to the eyebrow ring.

9
00:00:28,447 --> 00:00:29,766
Oh, excuse me, good sir.

10
00:00:29,927 --> 00:00:32,680
Could you direct me, please,
to Cubby's World of Comics?

11
00:00:32,847 --> 00:00:34,758
- Yeah, it's right over there.
- Oh.

12
00:00:34,927 --> 00:00:38,203
Thank you. Thank you very much.
You're a fierce but helpful people.

13
00:00:38,367 --> 00:00:40,164
Oh, stop.

14
00:00:42,847 --> 00:00:46,522
- Good Lord. That's Jackson Hedley.
- Who?

15
00:00:46,687 --> 00:00:48,643
FRASIER: Jackson Hedley,
the famous Shakespearean actor.

16
00:00:48,807 --> 00:00:50,320
He came to my school
when I was a teen,

17
00:00:50,487 --> 00:00:53,047
did a show of soliloquies,
began my love affair with the Bard.

18
00:00:53,207 --> 00:00:56,643
Excuse me, Roz, I think I'll just go
pay my respects to Mr. Hedley.

19
00:01:01,567 --> 00:01:05,116
Excuse me. Um, what's
Jackson Hedley doing here?

20
00:01:05,287 --> 00:01:08,279
Signing autographs
and being awesome.

21
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:13,440
They've got the whole cast
of <i>Space Patrol</i> coming this weekend.

22
00:01:13,607 --> 00:01:15,882
Jackson Hedley
was on a television show?

23
00:01:16,047 --> 00:01:18,925
What, are you kidding?
He's Tobor, the ship's android.

24
00:01:19,087 --> 00:01:21,203
Where you been, man?

25
00:01:21,687 --> 00:01:23,006
I don't know.

26
00:01:23,167 --> 00:01:27,877
Reading, attending the theatre,
getting haircuts.

27
00:01:30,367 --> 00:01:32,756
Hi, Roz.

28
00:01:35,207 --> 00:01:36,242
Hi, Noel.

29
00:01:36,407 --> 00:01:38,398
So you're a closet Trekker.

30
00:01:38,567 --> 00:01:41,923
I always had a feeling
we were more than mere coworkers.

31
00:01:42,087 --> 00:01:45,682
This explains the heat between us.

32
00:01:45,847 --> 00:01:49,283
I feel heat, all right.
Because I'm in hell.

33
00:01:49,447 --> 00:01:51,756
- There you are, Dwayne.
- Thanks, Tobor.

34
00:01:52,287 --> 00:01:53,356
FRASIER:
Hello, Mr. Hedley.

35
00:01:53,887 --> 00:01:55,605
May I say
it's an honour to see you again.

36
00:01:55,767 --> 00:01:58,076
Thank you. So, what would you like
to be autographed today?

37
00:01:58,247 --> 00:01:59,805
Actually, I already have
your autograph.

38
00:01:59,967 --> 00:02:02,879
I got it after seeing
your performance of <i>Hamlet.</i>

39
00:02:03,047 --> 00:02:04,275
Oh, my.

40
00:02:04,447 --> 00:02:07,678
- That was a long time ago.
- But not forgotten.

41
00:02:07,847 --> 00:02:09,883
May I say, on behalf
of my brother and myself,

42
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:14,165
thank you for opening our young eyes
to the wonders of Shakespeare.

43
00:02:14,327 --> 00:02:16,045
You are more than welcome.

44
00:02:16,207 --> 00:02:18,721
Tell me, do you get to do
much theatre anymore?

45
00:02:18,887 --> 00:02:20,764
Oh, no, I'm afraid
those days are over.

46
00:02:20,927 --> 00:02:22,485
The show became so popular,

47
00:02:22,647 --> 00:02:26,720
I can't get cast as anything
but an android, a cyborg,

48
00:02:26,887 --> 00:02:31,722
or when I get a chance
to really spread my wings, a mutant.

49
00:02:31,887 --> 00:02:36,403
Well, what a shame.
For you and the theatre.

50
00:02:36,567 --> 00:02:38,558
Oh, you are very kind.

51
00:02:38,727 --> 00:02:41,161
Well, my fans await.
It was lovely meeting you, Mr...

52
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:42,521
Frasier Crane.

53
00:02:42,687 --> 00:02:44,962
Thank you, Mr. Hedley.

54
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:49,802
It just breaks my heart
to see that man reduced to this.

55
00:02:50,367 --> 00:02:51,880
So demeaning.

56
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:53,765
Well, so he's not
doing Shakespeare,

57
00:02:53,927 --> 00:02:55,918
but look, he's got tons of fans
that worship him.

58
00:02:56,087 --> 00:02:57,600
What's so demeaning about that?

59
00:02:57,767 --> 00:03:02,204
Hey, Tobor, would you do
my kid's birthday party?

60
00:03:02,367 --> 00:03:04,244
Here's my card.

61
00:03:04,407 --> 00:03:08,161
Travel time is extra
and I eat by myself.

62
00:03:16,887 --> 00:03:19,401
- Hey, look who I found at the airport.
- Oh.

63
00:03:19,567 --> 00:03:21,603
Welcome home, Dad.
So how was Florida?

64
00:03:21,767 --> 00:03:23,837
Oh, it was a whirlwind.

65
00:03:24,007 --> 00:03:25,565
Duke and I hit the dog track,

66
00:03:25,727 --> 00:03:30,482
and then we met the Michael Jordan
of jai alai players at the Red Lobster.

67
00:03:30,647 --> 00:03:34,322
But the place I went back to most of all
was Captain Pete's Gator Farm.

68
00:03:34,487 --> 00:03:36,717
Ah, ah. Did you go see
the Hemingway home?

69
00:03:36,887 --> 00:03:40,004
Well, you know, Fras,
you can't squeeze everything in.

70
00:03:41,127 --> 00:03:43,721
But I tell you,
these gators are amazing.

71
00:03:43,887 --> 00:03:45,639
You're out in the glades
in this fan boat,

72
00:03:45,807 --> 00:03:50,039
and it's just you and Captain Pete
and a cooler full of raw chickens.

73
00:03:51,647 --> 00:03:54,081
To think I wasted
my last vacation in Vienna.

74
00:03:54,247 --> 00:03:57,045
Then he dangles a chicken at the end
of a stick and before you know it,

75
00:03:57,207 --> 00:03:59,880
a 15-foot monster
comes rushing out of the water.

76
00:04:00,047 --> 00:04:01,082
And he's yelling:

77
00:04:01,247 --> 00:04:04,319
"Hurry up and take the picture.
This son of a bitch is heavy!"

78
00:04:05,487 --> 00:04:07,079
That's delightful, Dad.

79
00:04:07,927 --> 00:04:10,839
- Where's Daphne?
- My honey bunny has the flu.

80
00:04:11,007 --> 00:04:12,326
Aww, that's too bad.

81
00:04:12,487 --> 00:04:15,638
Probably got it standing
in front of an open refrigerator.

82
00:04:16,567 --> 00:04:18,000
Nice to have you back, Dad.

83
00:04:19,487 --> 00:04:21,478
- Frasier.
- Oh, thank you, Niles.

84
00:04:21,647 --> 00:04:24,923
- You will never guess what I found.
- Hm?

85
00:04:26,807 --> 00:04:30,482
This is the autograph Jackson Hedley
gave me in junior high school.

86
00:04:30,647 --> 00:04:32,558
Oh, Niles.

87
00:04:33,887 --> 00:04:38,403
"Dear Coach Pellit, please excuse
Niles from gym for obvious reasons."

88
00:04:38,847 --> 00:04:40,803
- The other side.
- I figured.

89
00:04:42,047 --> 00:04:46,837
"To Niles, my kingdom
for more fans like you.

90
00:04:47,007 --> 00:04:48,998
Jackson Hedley." Gosh.

91
00:04:49,167 --> 00:04:50,646
That's lovely.

92
00:04:50,807 --> 00:04:53,480
Of course, I'm still envious
that you got to see him again.

93
00:04:53,647 --> 00:04:55,558
You wouldn't be
if you'd been at that convention.

94
00:04:55,727 --> 00:04:59,606
To see the man who defined Hamlet

95
00:04:59,767 --> 00:05:03,999
reduced to hawking T-shirts
and sci-fi gewgaws.

96
00:05:04,167 --> 00:05:06,442
- It's a terrible waste of talent.
- Tragic.

97
00:05:06,607 --> 00:05:09,883
No artist should have to endure that.

98
00:05:10,047 --> 00:05:12,800
If only people could see him
the way we did.

99
00:05:14,127 --> 00:05:15,640
Niles,

100
00:05:15,807 --> 00:05:19,163
how difficult would it be
to mount Jackson's one-man show?

101
00:05:19,327 --> 00:05:20,362
It's relatively simple.

102
00:05:20,527 --> 00:05:24,486
That's true. There's minimal scenery,
no supporting ca...

103
00:05:26,207 --> 00:05:28,641
- Wait a minute, are you suggesting...?
- Well, why not?

104
00:05:28,807 --> 00:05:31,002
There's certainly no shortage
of theatres in this town.

105
00:05:31,167 --> 00:05:33,283
We could do it on a Monday
when they're dark anyway.

106
00:05:33,447 --> 00:05:34,721
We could revive the man's career.

107
00:05:34,887 --> 00:05:38,402
What a gift it would be to return this
man to the stage where he belongs.

108
00:05:38,567 --> 00:05:41,320
It would be like repaying him
for giving us the gift of Shakespeare.

109
00:05:41,487 --> 00:05:43,284
And if the evening goes very well,
who knows?

110
00:05:43,447 --> 00:05:45,836
We could be in for a long run.
We might take it on the road.

111
00:05:46,007 --> 00:05:48,157
Why not a television special?
A much larger audience.

112
00:05:48,327 --> 00:05:50,238
It could become a cottage industry:

113
00:05:50,407 --> 00:05:52,967
T-shirts, posters,
personal appearances.

114

to save this man.

Tonight I can really cut loose.

311
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:29,797
Those seats in the very back row
will be rattling.

That is good news.

Five minutes to curtain.

And now, if you'll excuse me,

it's time to centre.

Any more ideas?

These are the producers.

Do you guys have any idea
how many people you got out there?

319
00:16:56,247 --> 00:16:57,566
You're way over capacity.

You're not going to shut us down,
are you?

Frasier, I knew we shouldn't have
added all those dry wooden seats.

Well, maybe next time
you'll know better.

Mr. Hedley,
I'm afraid we have some bad news.

Hey, you're Tobor.

Correct.

327
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:16,520
I used to watch your show
all the time.

328
00:17:16,687 --> 00:17:20,475
I even have that old <i>Playboy</i> when
Space Princess Alexa did that spread.

The one on the lava rocks.
Yes, I've got that one too.

he was the one performing tonight.

I'll let you guys stay open
on one condition:

I get to watch the show.

- We're out of seats.
- It's okay. I'll sit in the aisle.

334
00:17:36,247 --> 00:17:39,603
- Three minutes to curtain.
- Ah, here's the right one.

335
00:17:42,047 --> 00:17:44,083
Well, we may as well
just take our lumps.

336
00:17:44,247 --> 00:17:47,523
No, no, we're not
going to take any lumps.

Mr. Hedley, are you all right?

I think I've broken something.

- Oh, my God.
NILES: Call an ambulance.

- Make sure Mr. Hedley's comfortable.
- Yes.

Dear God, Niles, I feel horrible.

It's as if we wished it
and it happened.

Half of me feels guilty.
The other half feels relieved.

Actually, it's more 30-70.

356
00:18:49,447 --> 00:18:52,439
Well, I guess I'd better go out
and make an announcement.

had hoped to bring a great talent
back to the stage.
