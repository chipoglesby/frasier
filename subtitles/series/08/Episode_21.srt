Oh, well, apology accepted, son.

303
00:16:33,607 --> 00:16:35,757
We've both been cranky.
It's probably just the rain.

304
00:16:35,967 --> 00:16:39,357
No, Dad, listen, listen. I want us to go
to games together. I really do.

305
00:16:39,527 --> 00:16:43,281
And I want us to see movies
and go drinking at McGinty's...

306
00:16:43,447 --> 00:16:46,962
- Well, that's great, son.
- No, Dad. I'm trying to say something.

307
00:16:47,127 --> 00:16:50,005
I'm not ready for you to leave.

308
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:54,726
L... I don't want you to move in here.
I'd miss you too much.

309
00:16:54,927 --> 00:16:57,839
Please, Dad, come home. Please?

310
00:16:58,007 --> 00:17:01,556
What the hell are you talking about?
I'm not moving in here.

311
00:17:01,727 --> 00:17:04,446
But Miranda told me you'd filled out
an application. That you told her

312
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:06,598
you'd found a new home.

313
00:17:06,767 --> 00:17:08,120
[WHISPERING]
Well, I had to.

314
00:17:08,287 --> 00:17:12,121
It's the only way to stay in the game.
It's for residents only.

315
00:17:13,687 --> 00:17:16,997
This was just a ruse
so you could continue playing poker?

316
00:17:17,167 --> 00:17:20,079
Well, it's not just poker.
It's poker with the three worst players

317
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:22,397
I've ever seen.

318
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:25,565
Hey, Marty, you in?
Sid's got a pair of tens showing.

319
00:17:26,047 --> 00:17:28,117
[IN NORMAL VOICE]
Look at me, Sid.

320
00:17:29,167 --> 00:17:32,443
Raise you 20. You dream about
getting in games like this all your life.

321
00:17:32,607 --> 00:17:35,041
But you never think
it's gonna happen. Ha-ha-ha!

322
00:17:35,207 --> 00:17:38,199
Dad, Dad, please. I can't let you go on
taking advantage of these people.

323
00:17:38,367 --> 00:17:40,881
I'm not taking advantage of them.
I'm giving them an education.

324
00:17:41,047 --> 00:17:43,322
Consider it an expensive seminar.

325
00:17:43,487 --> 00:17:44,636
Seminar, my eye.

326
00:17:44,807 --> 00:17:48,277
Now, you're gonna give every dime
of that money back to those men.

327
00:17:48,447 --> 00:17:51,120
All right. I'll let them win it back.

328
00:17:51,287 --> 00:17:54,085
- Come on, Marty. You in?
- All right. Yeah, I'm in.

329
00:17:54,247 --> 00:17:57,603
Let's see.
Lee's got a pair of aces. Whoa!

330
00:17:58,607 --> 00:18:01,565
Three tens here. What have I got?

331
00:18:01,727 --> 00:18:04,036
Four, five, seven...

332
00:18:04,207 --> 00:18:07,643
Well, I'll just bet it all.

333
00:18:07,807 --> 00:18:10,002
Too rich for my blood.

334
00:18:12,647 --> 00:18:14,956
I'll leave the light on for you, Dad.

335
00:18:19,167 --> 00:18:23,206
How are you holding up?
Is that spider still around?

336
00:18:24,887 --> 00:18:29,597
I think he's realised he's more afraid
of me than I am of him.

337
00:18:29,767 --> 00:18:32,964
He's not in his corner.
He's not in his corner.

338
00:18:33,727 --> 00:18:37,356
Oh. There he is. Found him. Ha-ha.

339
00:18:38,607 --> 00:18:42,566
Oh, Daphne, you must be starving.
Please, don't wait for me.

340
00:18:42,727 --> 00:18:45,002
You go ahead and eat.

341
00:18:45,687 --> 00:18:47,564
You're sure?

342
00:18:51,607 --> 00:18:54,075
Oh! I just saw one.

343
00:18:54,247 --> 00:18:57,922
- A spider?
- No, a meteor.

344
00:18:58,087 --> 00:19:01,159
It's beautiful.
It just appeared out of nowhere.

345
00:19:01,327 --> 00:19:05,400
That's it. I missed it the last time.
I'm not gonna let it happen again.

346
00:19:05,567 --> 00:19:10,118
Daphne, stand back.
This door is coming down.

347
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:16,925
Okay, I'm ready.

348
00:19:20,247 --> 00:19:24,320
Oh! I just saw another one.
Oh, it's breathtaking.

349
00:19:24,487 --> 00:19:27,684
It just streaked
from one end of the sky to the other.

350
00:19:27,847 --> 00:19:30,680
Oh, Niles, I wish you could see this.

351
00:19:30,847 --> 00:19:33,156
So do I, my love.

352
00:19:34,087 --> 00:19:35,725
What did you just call me?

353
00:19:36,287 --> 00:19:38,118
Oh, well, it was kind of a place-filler.

354
00:19:38,287 --> 00:19:40,881
I didn't have time
to think of a good one.

355
00:19:41,687 --> 00:19:45,202
No, I like it.

356
00:19:45,367 --> 00:19:48,757
"My love." Yeah, it's nice.

357
00:19:51,367 --> 00:19:55,042
- Oh! I just saw another one.
- What's it look like?

358
00:19:55,207 --> 00:19:57,516
It's got a long, glittering tail.

359
00:19:57,727 --> 00:20:00,366
It reminds me of the time my father
drove home from the pub

360
00:20:00,527 --> 00:20:03,485
with a trash can
stuck underneath his car.

361
00:20:03,647 --> 00:20:05,842
Sparks were flying everywhere.

362
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:11,367
- Did I ever tell you that story?
- No, you never did, my love.

363
00:20:11,527 --> 00:20:15,918
Well, my father stopped in at the pub
on his way home from work...
