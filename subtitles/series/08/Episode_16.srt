00:07:36,127 --> 00:07:37,401
It's just that I'm asked a lot.

158
00:07:37,567 --> 00:07:39,797
And if I helped him,
then I'd have to do it for everyone.

159
00:07:39,967 --> 00:07:41,366
I'd hate to open those floodgates.

160
00:07:41,527 --> 00:07:43,324
- You understand.
- Yeah.

161
00:07:43,727 --> 00:07:47,402
My ex is the one I should be asking,
but that would be a waste of time.

162
00:07:48,047 --> 00:07:49,400
He doesn't help out with the kids?

163
00:07:50,447 --> 00:07:52,836
No, the only kid
he has time for is Kathy,

164
00:07:53,007 --> 00:07:55,919
his 22-year-old receptionist.
It's sickening.

165
00:07:58,367 --> 00:08:00,198
- Do you mind if I smoke?
- Well, actually, l...

166
00:08:00,367 --> 00:08:02,642
I'll just crack a window.

167
00:08:07,727 --> 00:08:09,957
You know, I'm glad
you asked me out tonight.

168
00:08:10,127 --> 00:08:12,277
Tomorrow's my birthday.

169
00:08:12,487 --> 00:08:13,522
- Really? Well...
- Yeah.

170
00:08:13,687 --> 00:08:15,564
Happy birthday.

171
00:08:15,727 --> 00:08:17,080
Hardly.

172
00:08:17,287 --> 00:08:20,484
That's the day Bob and Kathy
have chosen to get married.

173
00:08:20,647 --> 00:08:22,365
In Tahiti.

174
00:08:22,567 --> 00:08:24,603
Some birthday.

175
00:08:29,567 --> 00:08:32,843
It's all right. It's good.
Tonight will get my mind off of it.

176
00:08:33,007 --> 00:08:35,362
Just promise me that I won't
even hear the word "birthday"

177
00:08:35,527 --> 00:08:37,245
for the rest of the night, okay?

178
00:08:39,087 --> 00:08:40,281
Are you sure?

179
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:45,965
I mean, maybe a big celebration
would be the best revenge.

180
00:08:46,167 --> 00:08:48,044
What am I celebrating,

181
00:08:48,207 --> 00:08:51,563
the fact that I'm becoming
an old trot

182
00:08:51,727 --> 00:08:54,195
and no one's
ever gonna love me again?

183
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,517
Oh, God. Shut up.

184
00:09:03,527 --> 00:09:04,755
Aren't we going to Bella Lucia?

185
00:09:04,927 --> 00:09:08,966
Well, actually, I know this little
Thai place that I think will be better.

186
00:09:09,167 --> 00:09:12,239
Were you even gonna ask me?
I hate Thai food.

187
00:09:12,407 --> 00:09:15,479
Typical man. "I like Thai food
so she must like Thai food."

188
00:09:17,447 --> 00:09:20,484
All right. Bella Lucia it is.

189
00:09:20,687 --> 00:09:23,724
I'm sorry. I'm being snappy.

190
00:09:24,087 --> 00:09:26,555
It's just I...

191
00:09:26,767 --> 00:09:28,086
I guess I just always thought

192
00:09:28,247 --> 00:09:30,761
that I'd be the one
that got remarried first, you know?

193
00:09:31,567 --> 00:09:34,400
Now everybody's
just gonna feel sorry for me.

194
00:09:34,967 --> 00:09:37,561
Oh, God, I hope I don't run
into anybody I know tonight.

195
00:09:39,647 --> 00:09:43,401
And you're not a typical man.

196
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:48,364
You're very thoughtful.
You forgive me?

197
00:09:51,047 --> 00:09:52,321
Yes, I'm afraid I do.

198
00:09:53,567 --> 00:09:55,159
Oh, gosh.

199
00:09:55,327 --> 00:09:58,046
You know, I do know
another little Italian place

200
00:09:58,207 --> 00:10:01,643
that I think you might
really enjoy just as much.

201
00:10:01,807 --> 00:10:02,842
What do you say?

202
00:10:03,247 --> 00:10:05,841
- Great. Sounds great.
- Okay.

203
00:10:06,567 --> 00:10:09,320
You know, it's funny, as much as
I hate the thought of my birthday,

204
00:10:09,487 --> 00:10:12,047
I'm kind of hurt that none
of my friends asked me to do anything.

205
00:10:12,207 --> 00:10:16,325
I mean, it's not like I wanted a party,
but something would've been nice.

206
00:10:22,767 --> 00:10:23,882
Okay, Frasier, you know what,

207
00:10:24,047 --> 00:10:26,515
just because I'm vulnerable,
doesn't mean you're getting some.

208
00:10:26,727 --> 00:10:27,762
No, listen.

209
00:10:27,927 --> 00:10:30,885
Fifty of your friends are sitting
in Bella Lucia right now

210
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:33,686
wearing party hats
and waiting to yell "surprise."

211
00:10:33,847 --> 00:10:35,803
Do you wanna go or not?

212
00:10:36,727 --> 00:10:39,287
My friends are throwing me
a surprise party?

213
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:41,205
That's right.

214
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:44,160
And you tell me and ruin it?

215
00:10:53,167 --> 00:10:55,078
Surprise!

216
00:10:55,247 --> 00:11:00,719
Oh, my God, you didn't!
You, you did this.

217
00:11:03,047 --> 00:11:07,802
Frasier, you tricked me.
You awful thing.

218
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:10,322
It wasn't easy,
you nightmarish carp.

219
00:11:12,007 --> 00:11:14,726
Oh, thanks.

220
00:11:14,887 --> 00:11:18,163
Debbie. Oh, hi. Bruce, hi.

221
00:11:18,327 --> 00:11:21,444
I am so thrilled
you all came here for this.

222
00:11:21,647 --> 00:11:23,478
I thought a lot of you
would've flown to Tahiti

223
00:11:23,647 --> 00:11:26,764
for the wedding
of dumbo and bimbo.

224
00:11:28,567 --> 00:11:30,637
Thanks for getting her here.

225
00:11:31,367 --> 00:11:33,244
How did you manage
to keep it a secret?

226
00:11:33,407 --> 00:11:36,843
Well, as a psychiatrist,

227
00:11:37,007 --> 00:11:40,317
discretion happens to be
the cornerstone of my profession.

228
00:11:40,527 --> 00:11:43,963
Of course. Mine too.
I'm a family therapist.

229
00:11:44,487 --> 00:11:45,681
Really?

230
00:11:45,847 --> 00:11:48,236
You know, I sensed
we'd have a lot in common.

231
00:11:48,447 --> 00:11:50,802
You know,
it's funny how things turn out.

232
00:11:50,967 --> 00:11:55,165
I started out as a music major
studying cello.

233
00:11:57,327 --> 00:11:58,396
You're a cellist?

234
00:11:58,607 --> 00:12:03,044
Yes, but psychology
is my true calling.

235
00:12:03,207 --> 00:12:05,926
<i>Spawning fish may leap upstream</i>
<i>For many seasons</i>

236
00:12:06,087 --> 00:12:07,964
<i>Yet come home to stay</i>

237
00:12:10,087 --> 00:12:13,363
- Was that a haiku?
- Yes.

238
00:12:14,127 --> 00:12:15,355
It's a...

239
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:18,997
It's a habit of mine.
They just sort of spill out of me.

240
00:12:19,167 --> 00:12:22,364
That's amazing.
May I get you a drink?

241
00:12:22,927 --> 00:12:26,636
Yes, a martini. Two olives.

242
00:12:26,847 --> 00:12:29,964
I knew it. Oh.

243
00:12:31,047 --> 00:12:33,607
- Kierkegaard?
- Love him.

244
00:12:34,727 --> 00:12:36,479
Don't move.

245
00:12:38,327 --> 00:12:40,841
Claire, what are you doing
standing here alone?

246
00:12:41,007 --> 00:12:43,999
I want you to meet Neil,
that guy I told you about.

247
00:12:45,127 --> 00:12:48,358
- Claire, Neil.
- Hi.

248
00:12:52,247 --> 00:12:53,726
MARTIN:
All right, what's it say now?

249
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:56,276
DAPHNE:
"Alternatively, see Appendix C,

250
00:12:56,487 --> 00:12:59,240
'Advanced Troubleshooting
Specifications And You."'

251
00:12:59,447 --> 00:13:01,642
That's it. I quit.

252
00:13:02,727 --> 00:13:04,206
What do you want to do?

253
00:13:04,807 --> 00:13:08,197
Well, I went to a party once
where we each went around the room

254
00:13:08,367 --> 00:13:10,835
and confessed
our most shameful secret.

255
00:13:11,007 --> 00:13:14,317
Except it had to be something
that you've never told anyone before.

256
00:13:14,487 --> 00:13:18,196
I don't think that's something
we really wanna get into.

257
00:13:19,367 --> 00:13:20,561
No, it sounds like fun.

258
00:13:20,727 --> 00:13:22,524
Okay, I'll go first.

259
00:13:24,007 --> 00:13:25,360
Oh, let's see. All right.

260
00:13:25,527 --> 00:13:29,440
Well, Daphne, you might as well make
your acquaintance with my dark side.

261
00:13:31,407 --> 00:13:35,764
In 5th grade,
there was a bully, Jack Winfield,

262
00:13:35,927 --> 00:13:37,724
and he was bothering a lot of the girls.

263
00:13:37,887 --> 00:13:39,923
So one day,
I waited for him outside of school

264
00:13:40,087 --> 00:13:42,396
and gave him a sound thumping.

265
00:13:46,487 --> 00:13:48,682
Wasn't that the kid with rickets?

266
00:13:50,127 --> 00:13:52,721
Rickets and a smart mouth.

267
00:13:53,887 --> 00:13:55,115
Daphne, you go next.

268
00:13:55,287 --> 00:13:57,642
And think of something juicier
than that.

269
00:13:58,767 --> 00:14:02,521
Well, mine's also
a youthful indiscretion.

270
00:14:03,727 --> 00:14:05,797
I stole a teddy bear from the shops.

271
00:14:06,807 --> 00:14:07,922
Then what?

272
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:12,643
Well, I felt guilty, so I told my parents
and we brought it back.

273
00:14:12,807 --> 00:14:17,403
Then as a penance, I volunteered
to work at the orphanage after school.

274
00:14:23,247 --> 00:14:26,637
What the hell was that?
I'd put that story on my résumé.

275
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:29,719
Come on, Martin,
you've gotta have something.

276
00:14:29,927 --> 00:14:31,565
- Shock me.
- Oh, I don't know.

277
00:14:31,727 --> 00:14:32,762
It's kind of personal.

278
00:14:32,967 --> 00:14:34,844
That's what we're looking for.

279
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:39,285
Well, all right,
but it doesn't leave this room.

280
00:14:40,727 --> 00:14:43,844
Every time I watch
<i>The Sound of Music</i>,

281
00:14:44,167 --> 00:14:45,566
I cry.

282
00:14:47,727 --> 00:14:52,642
And I don't mean a single manly tear,
I mean real blubbering.

283
00:14:52,807 --> 00:14:54,035
Girl-style.

284
00:14:55,567 --> 00:14:58,127
The nuns, those kids...

285
00:14:59,447 --> 00:15:02,120
...the lonely goatherd.

286
00:15:03,807 --> 00:15:06,799
These are your deep, dark secrets?
This is baby stuff.

287
00:15:06,967 --> 00:15:09,242
"Oh, I dropped my ice cream
and I ate it."

288
00:15:09,447 --> 00:15:11,199
Okay, let's hear yours, then.

289
00:15:11,367 --> 00:15:13,562
You can't handle mine.
Let's play Clue or something.

290
00:15:13,767 --> 00:15:15,485
- Oh, come on.
- Come on.

291
00:15:15,687 --> 00:15:18,645
Are you kidding? We can take
anything you can dish out.

292
00:15:18,847 --> 00:15:20,246
I was in the war. I was a cop.

293
00:15:20,407 --> 00:15:22,602
- I even worked Vice.
- I don't think so.

294
00:15:22,807 --> 00:15:24,604
Come on, tell you what,
whisper it in my ear,

295
00:15:24,767 --> 00:15:26,678
and if I think they can handle it,
I'll tell them.

296
00:15:27,767 --> 00:15:29,519
Okay.

297
00:15:55,047 --> 00:15:57,402
Where was Kathy
when I was busting my ass

298
00:15:57,567 --> 00:15:59,444
putting him through dental school?

299
00:15:59,647 --> 00:16:03,879
Oh, oh, that's right.
She wasn't born yet!

300
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:07,277
- Who wants more cake?
- Not me, but I'll go with you.

301
00:16:09,327 --> 00:16:12,763
Here we are.
This is one of my favourites.

302
00:16:12,967 --> 00:16:16,642
That's so sweet of you,
but Neil just brought me a glass.

303
00:16:16,847 --> 00:16:18,519
Opus One.

304
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:20,439
Opus One.
That's a delightful little wine.

305
00:16:20,607 --> 00:16:24,885
Yes, it's very nice, but this happens
to be a Barbaresco Gaja,

306
00:16:25,047 --> 00:16:28,722
the greatest Italian red
since Roberto Rossellini.

307
00:16:33,527 --> 00:16:35,040
Well...

308
00:16:37,367 --> 00:16:39,085
Mm.

309
00:16:43,527 --> 00:16:45,802
- Mm.
- Ah.

310
00:16:45,967 --> 00:16:48,435
Well, they both taste wonderful.

311
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:50,837
I don't...
I can't choose between them.

312
00:16:51,047 --> 00:16:52,958
Taste mine again.

313
00:16:54,007 --> 00:16:55,759
You know,
if you're really interested in wine,

314
00:16:55,927 --> 00:16:57,918
you should let me fly you
down to Napa in my plane.

315
00:16:58,087 --> 00:16:59,918
We could spend the day
exploring the vineyards.

316
00:17:00,087 --> 00:17:03,477
That's very sweet, but those
little planes make me nervous.

317
00:17:03,687 --> 00:17:06,360
Really?
Well, how do you feel about BMWs?

318
00:17:07,647 --> 00:17:09,399
You see, I happen to know

319
00:17:09,567 --> 00:17:11,717
several of the proprietors
of the local vineyards here,

320
00:17:11,887 --> 00:17:13,605
and I'd be delighted
to be your tour guide.

321
00:17:14,727 --> 00:17:16,080
That's sounds tempting.

322
00:17:16,247 --> 00:17:19,796
Well, allow me to enchant you further.
You see, l...

323
00:17:22,247 --> 00:17:23,282
Claire, I'm sorry.

324
00:17:23,447 --> 00:17:25,597
You'll have to excuse me
for just a moment.

325
00:17:31,207 --> 00:17:33,516
Hi. How you doing?

326
00:17:34,047 --> 00:17:36,003
Everybody's leaving.

327
00:17:36,167 --> 00:17:37,282
Well, it's getting late.

328
00:17:37,447 --> 00:17:39,597
It's 9:30.

329
00:17:40,807 --> 00:17:43,321
Let's face it, I drove them all off.

330
00:17:43,527 --> 00:17:46,166
Even I'm sick of hearing me
complain about Bob.

331
00:17:46,327 --> 00:17:48,557
Well, come on, it's not all that bad.

332
00:17:48,727 --> 00:17:51,719
I mean, listen, you know,
Bob is in the past.

333
00:17:51,887 --> 00:17:54,082
And just look
at all the friends you have.

334
00:17:55,447 --> 00:17:58,041
I know you've had
a bit of a tough time lately,

335
00:17:58,207 --> 00:17:59,879
but that'll end soon.

336
00:18:00,567 --> 00:18:04,560
You're a vibrant, attractive woman.

337
00:18:05,007 --> 00:18:06,645
Thanks, Frasier.

338
00:18:07,847 --> 00:18:10,441
- You're being awfully sweet to me.
- Oh.

339
00:18:11,287 --> 00:18:14,165
Don't think this means
you're getting any.

340
00:18:15,847 --> 00:18:17,599
We're saying our goodbyes.

341
00:18:17,767 --> 00:18:18,961
You're leaving?

342
00:18:19,127 --> 00:18:22,722
I have an early appointment and
Neil offered to give me a ride home.

343
00:18:22,927 --> 00:18:25,725
Well, how thoughtful of him.

344
00:18:25,927 --> 00:18:28,600
- Happy birthday, Lana.
- Oh, thank you.

345
00:18:29,487 --> 00:18:30,556
Bye.

346
00:18:30,727 --> 00:18:33,082
It's nice to see you again, Frasier.

347
00:18:33,287 --> 00:18:36,916
Lovely seeing you again, Claire.
Neil.

348
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:48,447
- Threw a gutter ball, huh?
- Yeah.

349
00:18:49,287 --> 00:18:51,198
Thanks to you.
You introduced them.

350
00:18:51,367 --> 00:18:55,076
Well, you played it all wrong.
You were hanging on her all night.

351
00:18:55,287 --> 00:18:56,925
Well, so was he, but he left with her.

352
00:18:57,127 --> 00:18:59,561
It won't last.
She's probably sick of him already.

353
00:18:59,767 --> 00:19:02,679
A lot of good that does me. I blew it.

354
00:19:02,847 --> 00:19:04,405
Not necessarily.

355
00:19:04,567 --> 00:19:07,127
I mean, I think you guys
could make a great couple.

356
00:19:07,287 --> 00:19:09,676
In fact, I might be able
to help you out there.

357
00:19:09,847 --> 00:19:12,361
Really? Would you?

358
00:19:12,527 --> 00:19:15,724
Well, I could, but you know,
I get asked that all the time.

359
00:19:15,887 --> 00:19:18,481
And if I did it for you,
I'd have to have to do it for everybody.

360
00:19:18,647 --> 00:19:23,004
And I just don't know
if I wanna open those floodgates.

361
00:19:23,167 --> 00:19:25,158
You know what I mean?

362
00:19:25,887 --> 00:19:28,003
I think I do.

363
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,839
Kirby needs a passing grade
in History.

364
00:19:30,007 --> 00:19:32,999
- I can't guarantee that.
- No passing grade, no Claire.

365
00:19:33,167 --> 00:19:34,395
All right, an hour on Tuesdays.

366
00:19:34,567 --> 00:19:35,966
Two hours on Tuesdays
and Thursdays.

367
00:19:36,127 --> 00:19:37,480
Two hours on Tuesdays,
no Thursday.

368
00:19:37,647 --> 00:19:38,716
Three on Tuesdays.

369
00:19:38,887 --> 00:19:41,606
- Done. Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

370
00:19:43,647 --> 00:19:47,196
Well, you are a very
lucky young man, Kirby.

371
00:19:47,367 --> 00:19:50,245
You know,
I loved studying U.S. History.

372
00:19:50,447 --> 00:19:51,846
What can be more fascinating

373
00:19:52,007 --> 00:19:58,321
than the rich and unfolding epic
of the very soil on which we live?

374
00:19:59,767 --> 00:20:02,998
Uh, will that question be on the test?

375
00:20:05,807 --> 00:20:07,445
Doubtful.

376
00:20:07,887 --> 00:20:10,117
So which chapter are you on?

377
00:20:10,327 --> 00:20:13,125
Whoa, is that my book?

378
00:20:14,967 --> 00:20:17,720
I see. Chapter 1.

379
00:20:19,367 --> 00:20:21,403
You may wanna take some notes.

380
00:20:21,767 --> 00:20:23,485
I don't have a pen.

381
00:20:23,647 --> 00:20:25,285
But just tell me, I'll remember it.

382
00:20:25,487 --> 00:20:28,445
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, that's gotten you far.

383
00:20:29,047 --> 00:20:32,084
Get off your ass and get a pen!

384
00:20:32,247 --> 00:20:35,398
No, not you, not you, not you.

385
00:21:54,167 --> 00:21:56,965
All right, Kirby, we've got a few
minutes before your mother gets here.

386
00:21:57,127 --> 00:21:59,118
One last question.

387
00:21:59,287 --> 00:22:00,800
In our studies this week,

388
00:22:00,967 --> 00:22:05,119
what did we learn
about William Henry Harrison?

389
00:22:06,167 --> 00:22:11,764
Well, I guess I would say
that this week, we learned

390
00:22:11,927 --> 00:22:15,681
that William Henry Harrison
was a great man

391
00:22:15,887 --> 00:22:20,039
who was important
because he was...

392
00:22:21,327 --> 00:22:25,036
- President?
- No. Yes, yes.

393
00:22:25,207 --> 00:22:27,562
Good, good.
And which president was he?

394
00:22:27,767 --> 00:22:30,076
Of the United States.

395
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:32,001
I mean which number?

396
00:22:33,087 --> 00:22:34,315
All right, here's a hint.

397
00:22:34,527 --> 00:22:38,236
He was elected in 1840.

398
00:22:38,447 --> 00:22:40,483
- Eighteen.
- No.

399
00:22:40,687 --> 00:22:42,996
- Forty?
- Kirby.

400
00:22:43,207 --> 00:22:45,038
Did you do any reading this week?

401
00:22:45,567 --> 00:22:47,876
- Sort of.
- What does "sort of" mean?

402
00:22:48,087 --> 00:22:49,805
- No.
- Right.

403
00:22:50,527 --> 00:22:51,596
Why not?

404
00:22:51,767 --> 00:22:54,327
Because it's a bunch of junk
I'm never gonna need to know.

405
00:22:54,487 --> 00:22:57,923
Kirby, this junk, as you call it,
may seem unimportant to you now,

406
00:22:58,087 --> 00:22:59,839
but knowing something
about where we came from

407
00:23:00,007 --> 00:23:02,362
may help you to decide
where you wish to go.

408
00:23:02,567 --> 00:23:08,437
Now, let's start learning about history
lest you be condemned to repeat it.

409
00:23:08,607 --> 00:23:09,642
Start reading.

410
00:23:09,807 --> 00:23:11,638
Continue until
your mother gets here.

411
00:23:13,127 --> 00:23:14,958
- Hi, Dad.
MARTIN: Hey, Fras.

412
00:23:15,167 --> 00:23:18,523
You know that guy Roger on 14,
has that little Scottish terrier?

413
00:23:19,127 --> 00:23:21,243
- Macduff?
- Right.

414
00:23:21,447 --> 00:23:24,564
Well, Roger's invited
all these dogs from the park

415
00:23:24,727 --> 00:23:26,718
to Macduff's birthday party.

416
00:23:26,887 --> 00:23:29,003
Except Eddie. Thank God.

417
00:23:29,167 --> 00:23:31,044
Have you ever heard
of anything more ridiculous?

418
00:23:31,247 --> 00:23:34,125
I see, and putting a hat on Eddie
for every major holiday, that's normal?

419
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:37,757
- What? It's not every holiday.
- Oh, Dad, please.

420
00:23:37,967 --> 00:23:40,845
He's got a Santa cap for Christmas,
he's got a top hat for New Year's Eve.

421
00:23:41,007 --> 00:23:42,918
He's got a tam-o'-shanter
for Saint Patrick's Day.

422
00:23:43,087 --> 00:23:46,284
Well, they're just hats.
I mean, it's not a whole party.

423
00:23:46,447 --> 00:23:47,960
I mean,
a dog doesn't know his birthday

424
00:23:48,167 --> 00:23:50,203
any more than he knows
Friday or Saturday or...

425
00:23:50,407 --> 00:23:52,477
Or Cinco de Mayo?

426
00:23:52,647 --> 00:23:55,480
That sombrero was a gift.

427
00:23:56,407 --> 00:23:57,601
Keep reading.

428
00:23:58,767 --> 00:24:00,485
That's nice
that you're helping the kid out.

429
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:04,401
Yeah, well, truth be told, Dad.
I'm actually...

430
00:24:05,127 --> 00:24:07,357
I've made a little agreement
with Lana.

431
00:24:07,567 --> 00:24:09,523
You see,
if I help Kirby get a passing grade,

432
00:24:09,687 --> 00:24:11,917
Lana will set me up
with one of her girlfriends, Claire.

433
00:24:12,087 --> 00:24:14,362
Ah. I remember
when you used to tutor kids

434
00:24:14,527 --> 00:24:15,755
so they wouldn't beat you up.

435
00:24:15,927 --> 00:24:18,395
So I guess this is progress, huh?

436
00:24:18,927 --> 00:24:20,565
[DOORBELL RINGS]

437
00:24:20,727 --> 00:24:22,763
That would be your mother.

438
00:24:25,287 --> 00:24:26,640
- Hi, Lana.
- Hi, Frasier.

439
00:24:26,847 --> 00:24:28,803
You guys have
a good study session tonight?

440
00:24:29,007 --> 00:24:30,963
- Primo.
- We're making excellent progress.

441
00:24:31,127 --> 00:24:33,960
- Really? So, what'd you learn today?
- Yeah.

442
00:24:34,247 --> 00:24:38,798
Um... Well, today I learned
about William Henry Harrison,

443
00:24:38,967 --> 00:24:41,686
who was our ninth president.

444
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:45,844
I mean, tenth. I mean, ninth.

445
00:24:47,407 --> 00:24:48,442
Good. Not bad.

446
00:24:48,607 --> 00:24:51,075
So you're one step closer
to getting your prom privileges back.

447
00:24:51,247 --> 00:24:53,442
- Mom, I told you, I'm not going.
- Why not?

448
00:24:53,607 --> 00:24:54,881
Because you and Kristi broke up?

449
00:24:55,047 --> 00:24:56,480
Thanks for spreading
that around, Mom.

450
00:24:56,647 --> 00:25:00,083
Frasier doesn't care.
He went to the prom with his brother.

451
00:25:00,807 --> 00:25:02,877
Thanks for spreading that around.

452
00:25:03,087 --> 00:25:05,476
- Can I have a word with your mother?
- Sure.

453
00:25:05,687 --> 00:25:07,757
Here, sit in the car.
You can listen to the radio.

454
00:25:07,927 --> 00:25:09,883
But don't change my presets again.

455
00:25:10,087 --> 00:25:13,636
When you're in my car,
it's lite hits or nothing!

456
00:25:15,927 --> 00:25:17,042
What do you wanna talk about?

457
00:25:17,207 --> 00:25:19,596
I was wondering if you had
a chance to speak with Claire yet,

458
00:25:19,767 --> 00:25:21,758
seeing as how Kirby
may be getting a passing grade.

459
00:25:21,927 --> 00:25:24,441
- Actually, I saw Claire yesterday.
- You did? That's wonderful.

460
00:25:24,607 --> 00:25:27,167
I've been thinking about our first date.
I thought perhaps tapas.

461
00:25:27,327 --> 00:25:29,045
I know that sounds whimsical,
but hear me.

462
00:25:29,247 --> 00:25:32,637
Frasier, look, all I did was mention
that you were tutoring Kirby.

463
00:25:32,807 --> 00:25:33,876
But she was very impressed.

464
00:25:34,087 --> 00:25:36,442
But you're supposed to set us up.
We have a deal.

465
00:25:36,647 --> 00:25:37,875
I'm phasing you in slowly.

466
00:25:38,047 --> 00:25:40,641
Look, she just broke up with Neil
because he was rushing things.

467
00:25:40,807 --> 00:25:43,321
Trust me, if you don't time this right,
you're gonna blow it.

468
00:25:43,487 --> 00:25:45,443
All right,
there's no need to explain to me.

469
00:25:45,607 --> 00:25:48,326
If anyone understands the value
of restraint and taking things slowly,

470
00:25:48,487 --> 00:25:50,205
it is yours truly.

471
00:25:50,727 --> 00:25:52,524
Frasier, as I recall on our first date,

472
00:25:52,687 --> 00:25:54,803
you got me up to your apartment
on false pretences.

473
00:25:54,967 --> 00:25:57,561
You plied me with wine,
got me into bed,

474
00:25:57,727 --> 00:26:00,719
and then tried to weasel out
of ever seeing me again.

475
00:26:03,567 --> 00:26:06,365
I think "plied" is a bit strong.

476
00:26:09,967 --> 00:26:14,677
Hey, Frasier, I have a work-related
proposal I wanna run by you.

477
00:26:14,847 --> 00:26:16,599
Of course, Roz,
I'm always open to new ideas,

478
00:26:16,767 --> 00:26:18,883
creative thoughts,
outside-the-box thinking.

479
00:26:19,087 --> 00:26:20,566
I want Friday the 15th off.

480
00:26:20,727 --> 00:26:22,126
But be aware, if you say no,

481
00:26:22,287 --> 00:26:25,359
you'll be crushing a dream
I've had since college.

482
00:26:25,567 --> 00:26:27,956
A three-day weekend,
that's quite a dream.

483
00:26:28,687 --> 00:26:31,963
My dream is to have front-row seats
at Bruce Springsteen.

484
00:26:32,167 --> 00:26:34,442
That way, when he starts doing
"Dancing in the Dark,"

485
00:26:34,607 --> 00:26:37,121
there's a chance he'll pull me up
on-stage to dance with him.

486
00:26:37,287 --> 00:26:38,322
I see.

487
00:26:38,527 --> 00:26:42,236
And his concert is on
a Friday afternoon?

488
00:26:42,447 --> 00:26:44,165
No, Grandpa.

489
00:26:44,327 --> 00:26:47,080
Tickets go on sale Saturday
and I wanna be the first in line.

490
00:26:47,287 --> 00:26:48,845
If you hadn't called me Grandpa,

491
00:26:49,007 --> 00:26:51,646
I would have found a polite way
to say no, but as it is, no.

492
00:26:53,287 --> 00:26:56,597
I can't believe I didn't just call in sick
instead of telling you the truth.

493
00:26:56,767 --> 00:26:58,758
I just wasted perfectly
good honesty on you.

494
00:26:58,927 --> 00:27:00,326
Well...

495
00:27:00,487 --> 00:27:03,240
- His Royal Highness is here.
NILES: Thank you.

496
00:27:03,407 --> 00:27:04,999
- Hey, Frasier.
- Hi, Daph, Niles.

497
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:06,845
- Coffee, Niles?
NILES: Yes, please.

498
00:27:07,047 --> 00:27:09,845
I'll have the French Roast
with three shots of espresso.

499
00:27:10,047 --> 00:27:12,959
- The Defibrillator?
- Yeah, that's the one.

500
00:27:13,167 --> 00:27:15,556
- Need a little pick-me-up, Niles?
- I am exhausted.

501
00:27:15,727 --> 00:27:17,718
Sleeping with Daphne,
I'm not getting much rest.

502
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:19,645
The way she gyrates, it's like...

503
00:27:19,847 --> 00:27:21,997
Stop the simile.

504
00:27:23,567 --> 00:27:26,445
No use in conjuring up imagery
I'll only have to repress later.

505
00:27:27,447 --> 00:27:31,520
I'm talking about actual sleeping,
you degenerate jughead.

506
00:27:31,847 --> 00:27:32,882
Hey, sweetie.

507
00:27:33,047 --> 00:27:36,676
Hi, I was just telling Frasier
about your nightly tossing and turning.

508
00:27:37,127 --> 00:27:40,483
- She's like a tuna on a trawler deck.
- Yeah.

509
00:27:40,647 --> 00:27:43,957
I told you, I'm gonna need time
to adjust to sleeping with someone.

510
00:27:44,167 --> 00:27:46,158
Until then, you're just
gonna have to fight me off.

511
00:27:46,327 --> 00:27:48,363
I tried. You hurled me to the floor.

512
00:27:48,527 --> 00:27:50,245
You've never minded
the rough stuff before.

513
00:27:50,447 --> 00:27:52,358
That's it, I'm leaving.

514
00:27:52,527 --> 00:27:54,518
Good Lord, it's Claire.

515
00:27:54,727 --> 00:27:55,955
I thought you liked her.

516
00:27:56,167 --> 00:27:57,566
- I do.
- So, what's the problem?

517
00:27:57,767 --> 00:27:59,962
Lana has told me that I am
under no circumstances

518
00:28:00,127 --> 00:28:01,480
to ask her out on a date.

519
00:28:01,647 --> 00:28:04,445
She says that if I rush things,
I will ruin my chances.

520
00:28:05,327 --> 00:28:06,646
Frasier.

521
00:28:06,807 --> 00:28:09,002
- Claire, hi.
CLAIRE: Hi.

522
00:28:09,167 --> 00:28:10,282
Fancy seeing you here.

523
00:28:10,447 --> 00:28:12,324
I just came from the opera house.

524
00:28:12,487 --> 00:28:14,876
Can you believe
<i>Don Giovanni</i> is sold out?

525
00:28:15,087 --> 00:28:17,078
I wish I knew someone
with a subscription.

526
00:28:17,247 --> 00:28:20,603
You know, I could...
I could call someone for you.

527
00:28:20,767 --> 00:28:21,802
That'd be great.

528
00:28:21,967 --> 00:28:25,437
Hey, and while you're at it, see if you
can find someone who likes sherry.

529
00:28:25,607 --> 00:28:27,837
You know, Les Habitants
is having a tasting that week

530
00:28:28,007 --> 00:28:31,363
and I can't find anyone
who enjoys sherry as much as I do.

531
00:28:31,567 --> 00:28:34,365
Of course, I always have trouble
finding people who share my interests.

532
00:28:34,567 --> 00:28:37,127
I've been trying to convince someone
to go to London with me

533
00:28:37,327 --> 00:28:40,717
and see the New Tate Gallery
and the old Globe Theatre.

534
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:42,042
And finally, I just gave up.

535
00:28:42,207 --> 00:28:44,516
And tomorrow,
I'm going alone for ten days.

536
00:28:44,687 --> 00:28:47,645
- Life's just too short.
- Go out with me.

537
00:28:54,047 --> 00:28:55,560
The trick to remembering
the difference

538
00:28:55,727 --> 00:28:58,366
between William Henry Harrison
and William Howard Taft

539
00:28:58,527 --> 00:28:59,846
is a simple mnemonic device.

540
00:29:00,007 --> 00:29:01,599
Mne-what?

541
00:29:02,127 --> 00:29:03,765
It's a trick.

542
00:29:04,087 --> 00:29:06,157
Harrison died in office
after his first month,

543
00:29:06,367 --> 00:29:11,236
so we say William Henry Harrison
was hardly healthy.

544
00:29:11,447 --> 00:29:17,238
And you can't spell Taft
without the letters F-A-T.

545
00:29:18,767 --> 00:29:21,679
So now to remember two things,
I have to remember two other things.

546
00:29:21,847 --> 00:29:23,075
Plus the first two things.

547
00:29:23,287 --> 00:29:25,403
- Yes, yes.
- That's four things.

548
00:29:25,567 --> 00:29:28,001
But the first two things
are easier to remember,

549
00:29:28,167 --> 00:29:29,441
and they are clues to the second.

550
00:29:29,607 --> 00:29:31,598
Will you just try to keep up, Kirby?

551
00:29:31,807 --> 00:29:33,877
What are you getting
all up in my face for?

552
00:29:34,087 --> 00:29:36,203
Because you are not
working hard enough.

553
00:29:36,407 --> 00:29:38,796
- Well, whose fault is that?
- Yours.

554
00:29:39,007 --> 00:29:40,725
Whatever, dude.

555
00:29:40,927 --> 00:29:42,963
- How's it going?
- Well, I'm cool.

556
00:29:43,127 --> 00:29:44,879
As am I.

557
00:29:45,047 --> 00:29:47,197
- Frasier, will you stay for dinner?
- Sure.

558
00:29:47,367 --> 00:29:49,323
Hey, Kirby, go wash up.

559
00:29:50,167 --> 00:29:52,601
And use water!

560

Listen, Lana, um...

561
00:29:59,287 --> 00:30:03,519
...I ran into Claire this afternoon,
and I...

562
00:30:03,687 --> 00:30:07,475
Well, we got to talking,
and it seems as though we'll...

563
00:30:07,647 --> 00:30:10,002
- We're gonna be going out together.
- You're what?

You went behind my back.

566
00:30:14,007 --> 00:30:16,567
You had me convinced that you
held the keys to Claire's kingdom.

567
00:30:16,727 --> 00:30:18,206
The truth is, I didn't need the key.

568
00:30:18,367 --> 00:30:21,484
When I got there, the gates were open,
the mat said, "Welcome, Frasier."

If you think you are walking out
on Kirby, you can think again.

completely out of your mind because...

617
00:33:30,207 --> 00:33:31,845
Kirby,

618
00:33:32,687 --> 00:33:35,440
if I could convince Roz
to go to the prom with you,

619
00:33:36,207 --> 00:33:38,641
would you commit
to learning this material?

620
00:33:38,847 --> 00:33:41,839
And you think hard before you answer,
because if it's yes,

621
00:33:42,007 --> 00:33:44,567
you're in my house, mister.

622
00:33:46,887 --> 00:33:48,843
I'm in.

623
00:33:49,007 --> 00:33:50,440
Deal. Now, listen...

624
00:33:50,807 --> 00:33:53,640
We'll just keep this between us.
There's no need to tell your mom.

625
00:33:53,847 --> 00:33:55,599
- No problem.
- Great.

626
00:33:55,807 --> 00:33:57,479
So how are you gonna
get her to go with me?

627
00:33:57,647 --> 00:34:03,483
You just leave that up to me
and Mr. Bruce Springsteen.

628

The Boss.

629
00:34:05,727 --> 00:34:09,242
No, Bruce Springsteen.

630
00:34:12,687 --> 00:34:15,042
Never said there was
gonna be pop quizzes.

631
00:34:15,207 --> 00:34:17,437
That's the pop part.

632
00:34:18,207 --> 00:34:21,279
But don't despair, Kirby,
you got 19 out of 25. Well done.

00:34:21,447 --> 00:34:24,041
Looks like you're well
on your way to that prom.

MARTIN:
Eddie, Eddie, Eddie...

636

Dad, do you mind?
We're trying to work here.

637
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:34,637
I'm sorry.
I'm just trying to raise Eddie's spirits.

638
00:34:34,807 --> 00:34:38,436
Today's that stupid doggie party
he wasn't invited to.

639
00:34:38,927 --> 00:34:40,121
You still on that?

640
00:34:40,327 --> 00:34:42,716
Eddie's the heart and soul
of that doggie group.

641

We've been going
to that park for years.

Half of those people wouldn't even
know each other if it wasn't for us.

643

Now they're down there
drinking beer and swapping stories.

644
00:34:51,647 --> 00:34:54,320
Look at him.
It's just breaking Eddie's heart.

645
00:34:56,847 --> 00:34:59,566
Eddie's fine, Dad. Seems
you're the one who feels left out.

646
00:34:59,767 --> 00:35:01,200
I do not.

647
00:35:01,367 --> 00:35:04,165
And it just so happens that we've
got plans for this afternoon anyway.

648
00:35:04,327 --> 00:35:05,362
Big plans.

A party, huh?
Well, no, I hadn't heard about it.

Oh, really?

00:35:15,767 --> 00:35:17,325
Well, yeah,
I guess we could come down.

00:35:17,487 --> 00:35:21,036
Sure. Okay.
Yeah, well, be right down. Bye.

I knew it!

00:35:24,287 --> 00:35:25,879
The invite must have
got lost in the mail.

Well, see you later, boys.
It's party time!

It is.

You know, I think restaurants
are like museums.

Great food, like great art, has
the ability to both elevate and inspire.

Yes, I am.

KIRBY: Yes.

The lady and I
will have the Coca-Cola.

681

Yeah, make sure the lady's
has a lot of Jack Daniels in it.

Hi. Well, what are you doing here?

- Yes, what are you doing here?

I'm looking for Kirby.
It's his prom night.

00:37:17,567 --> 00:37:18,636
He left his camera at home.

Right, right, so I did.

There he is. See you guys later.

696
00:37:26,527 --> 00:37:28,882
Wait. You know, maybe I should
take the camera to the boy.

697
00:37:29,047 --> 00:37:30,719
Seeing you here
will only embarrass him.

Oh, please. He's used to that.

699
00:37:33,047 --> 00:37:34,639
Besides, the one
who should be embarrassed

700
00:37:34,807 --> 00:37:36,923
is that boy who's with his mother.

Lana is such a great mom.
She really cares about her kids.

702
00:37:41,407 --> 00:37:42,965
She sure does.

703
00:37:43,127 --> 00:37:46,119

What do you mean, she's with you?

Mom, would you cool out?

00:37:52,287 --> 00:37:54,118
How do you expect me to cool out
when you're...?

- What?

00:37:55,967 --> 00:37:57,241
- You're a hooker?
- No, I'm not.

00:37:57,447 --> 00:37:58,880
- She works for me.
- You're her pimp?

710
00:37:59,047 --> 00:38:02,437
- Is there a problem?
- No, everything's just fine.

711
00:38:02,647 --> 00:38:04,285
- You know this tramp?
- Yes, I do.

- I'm sorry!

Lana, please,
it's all innocent enough.

714
00:38:07,527 --> 00:38:09,722
I only did this
in order to motivate the boy.

715
00:38:09,927 --> 00:38:11,804
- By promising him sex?
- You promised him sex?

716
00:38:11,967 --> 00:38:14,561
- You're getting sex?
- I did not promise him sex!

717
00:38:14,767 --> 00:38:16,359

Lana, let me explain.

00:38:17,807 --> 00:38:19,798
I set him up with Roz
in exchange for his studying.

720
00:38:19,967 --> 00:38:21,002
LANA:
That's disgusting!

721
00:38:21,167 --> 00:38:23,397
It's no different than you
promising me a date with Claire

722
00:38:23,567 --> 00:38:25,364
- in exchange for tutoring Kirby.
- Excuse me?

723
00:38:25,807 --> 00:38:26,842
Claire...

724
00:38:27,047 --> 00:38:30,483
- You traded me like a commodity?
- Get off your high horse.

725
00:38:30,647 --> 00:38:33,320
- You tutored me to get to her?
- Kirby...

726
00:38:33,527 --> 00:38:35,643
I can't believe you used me, Lana.

one more time, lady...

00:38:41,367 --> 00:38:44,359
- Listen, sister, I'll call you whatever...
- You dangle me like bait?

730
00:38:44,567 --> 00:38:46,159
- Who's the prostitute now?
- Who are you?

731
00:38:46,327 --> 00:38:47,760
- Sit down!
KIRBY: You said you cared,

732
00:38:47,967 --> 00:38:51,118
but you're just as big a liar as

I'm gonna have
to ask you all to leave.

734
00:38:53,127 --> 00:38:54,321
Fine with me. Kirby, let's go.

735
00:38:54,487 --> 00:38:56,000
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Well, I am.

736
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:58,317
No, no, no, stop it, everybody!

738
00:39:04,487 --> 00:39:08,116
if you will all bear with me
for just a moment, please.

739
00:39:08,287 --> 00:39:09,720
Kirby, you are going to pass history

740
00:39:09,887 --> 00:39:11,718
and you are going to graduate
from high school.

741
00:39:11,927 --> 00:39:13,758
Roz, you are getting
your Springsteen ticket.

742
00:39:13,927 --> 00:39:15,599
Lana, if there is anyone
with whom your son

743
00:39:15,767 --> 00:39:18,076
could expect to have a wholesome,
innocent and chaste date,

744
00:39:18,247 --> 00:39:19,316
it is Roz Doyle.

745
00:39:19,527 --> 00:39:24,806
Claire, the only reason Lana did what
she did was out of love for her son.

746
00:39:26,367 --> 00:39:30,201
And if I compromised my ethics,

747
00:39:30,767 --> 00:39:36,876
it was only because I found myself
so utterly beguiled by you.

748
00:39:37,087 --> 00:39:42,081
Frasier, you are a strange
and charming man.

749
00:39:43,847 --> 00:39:45,883
You have no idea.

750
00:39:49,687 --> 00:39:51,040
Hi, Lana, it's Frasier.

751
00:39:51,207 --> 00:39:52,799
Yeah, listen,
I was hoping that I could

752
00:39:52,967 --> 00:39:54,685
maybe switch times
with Kirby tomorrow.

753
00:39:54,847 --> 00:39:57,680
Say move it up to 4:00
just after school?

754
00:39:57,847 --> 00:39:59,917
Great, great, good.

755
00:40:00,087 --> 00:40:02,999
Well, Claire and I have plans,
you know.

756
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:05,681
Yeah, I guess we are hitting it off.

757
00:40:07,247 --> 00:40:09,522
She said what about me?

758
00:40:10,207 --> 00:40:12,163
You're joking.

759
00:40:12,447 --> 00:40:14,563
Oh, you are joking.

760
00:40:16,087 --> 00:40:18,282
What did she say about me?

761
00:40:18,727 --> 00:40:20,445
Really?

762
00:40:20,967 --> 00:40:22,320
Well,

763
00:40:23,127 --> 00:40:27,484
I guess it just proves she's a sucker
for sophistication, taste,

00:40:27,647 --> 00:40:31,003
and dare I say it, Old World charm.
