Yes, I had a reservation

I'm crazy about you.

307
00:16:22,087 --> 00:16:24,476
I just started to feel
like you didn't wanna be here with me.

308
00:16:24,647 --> 00:16:27,844
Oh, gosh, nothing could be further
from the truth.

309
00:16:28,007 --> 00:16:29,998
I mean, this weekend
doesn't have to be perfect.

310
00:16:30,167 --> 00:16:31,839
Let's just try to have fun.

311
00:16:32,007 --> 00:16:33,042
- Fun?
- Yes.

312
00:16:33,207 --> 00:16:35,516
I can do that.

313
00:16:36,367 --> 00:16:39,518
Fun's been my nickname
since math camp.

314
00:16:41,127 --> 00:16:43,561
Math camp?

315
00:16:44,047 --> 00:16:46,925
You're just trying to get me into bed.

316
00:16:53,607 --> 00:16:58,556
I must say, this trip has certainly
taken a turn for the better.

317
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:04,881
I'll tell you something else.

318
00:17:05,047 --> 00:17:07,515
I'm happy.

319
00:17:07,687 --> 00:17:10,724
Utterly and completely happy.

320
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:23,763
I'm glad, Frasier. I'm happy too.

321
00:17:27,327 --> 00:17:30,876
CLAIRE: Frasier? Frasier?
- Hmm?

322
00:17:31,047 --> 00:17:32,765
- Frasier?
- Hmm?

323
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:35,077
Are you okay?
You were talking in your sleep.

324
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:39,799
Oh, yes. Yes, I'm okay. I'm fine.

325
00:17:39,967 --> 00:17:41,798
Go back to sleep.

326
00:18:02,567 --> 00:18:04,558
Hi, it's me, Frasier.

327
00:18:04,727 --> 00:18:08,117
Listen, I'm aware of the time.
It's just that...

328
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:10,517
You're the last person on earth
I thought I'd be calling,

329
00:18:10,687 --> 00:18:13,281
but I had this dream,
and I had to talk to you about it.

330
00:18:13,447 --> 00:18:15,836
LILITH:
Oh, God.

331
00:18:16,007 --> 00:18:20,364
I suppose you expect me to be
awake for this conversation, don't you?

332
00:18:20,527 --> 00:18:22,199
FRASIER:
<i>Okay, I'll be brief.</i>

333
00:18:22,367 --> 00:18:25,404
<i>It's just that I'm on vacation</i>
<i>with my girlfriend, Claire,</i>

334
00:18:25,567 --> 00:18:28,161
a woman who by all conventional
measures is perfect for me,

335
00:18:28,327 --> 00:18:31,000
and yet I've just had
a vivid sexual dream

336
00:18:31,167 --> 00:18:35,240
about someone
who differs from her entirely.

337
00:18:36,687 --> 00:18:38,405
A man?

338
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:43,000
Not that different.

339
00:18:44,127 --> 00:18:47,722
- Someone you've slept with?
FRASIER: <i>Well, yes.</i>

340
00:18:47,887 --> 00:18:49,764
But it didn't work out. You see, we...

341
00:18:49,927 --> 00:18:52,760
I worshipped her for years,
and then we had a parting of the ways

342
00:18:52,927 --> 00:18:55,521
because it turned out
that she was just unpleasant

343
00:18:55,687 --> 00:18:58,599
and confrontational, self-centred.

344
00:18:58,767 --> 00:19:02,442
Frasier, if you're dreaming about me,
just say it.

345
00:19:02,607 --> 00:19:05,679
No, Lilith, it's not you.

346
00:19:05,847 --> 00:19:07,485
It's a woman named Lana.

347
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:11,003
Well, it seems like
a textbook symbol dream.

348
00:19:11,167 --> 00:19:12,486
Why are you calling me?

349
00:19:13,207 --> 00:19:15,516
Well, because you know me
better than anybody else,

350
00:19:15,687 --> 00:19:18,599
and you're a terrific psychiatrist.

351
00:19:19,927 --> 00:19:21,042
Thank you.

352
00:19:21,487 --> 00:19:22,556
So, what do you think?

353
00:19:24,167 --> 00:19:29,036
As a working hypothesis,
I'd say you have the hots for Lana.

354
00:19:29,207 --> 00:19:31,402
FRASIER: <i>No, you see, maybe</i>
<i>I'm not making myself clear.</i>

355
00:19:31,567 --> 00:19:33,478
You see,
the woman irritates me no end.

356
00:19:33,647 --> 00:19:37,196
She's antagonistic
and opinionated, critical...

357
00:19:37,367 --> 00:19:40,803
So I see. What you're saying is that
unlike most women you've dated,

358
00:19:40,967 --> 00:19:42,116
she challenges you.

359
00:19:43,327 --> 00:19:47,878
Maybe so, but that's not the point.
You see, Claire is perfect for me.

360
00:19:48,527 --> 00:19:50,199
All right.

361
00:19:50,367 --> 00:19:54,155
Why does this dream
about Lana upset you?

362
00:19:55,487 --> 00:19:56,681
I don't know.

363
00:19:57,447 --> 00:19:59,119
Are you sure?

364
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:02,125
Lilith,

365
00:20:03,007 --> 00:20:05,043
do you think I know
how to be happy?

366
00:20:07,647 --> 00:20:11,925
Of course you do.
You just like a challenge.

367
00:20:12,087 --> 00:20:14,555
You've never been one
to take the easy road.

368
00:20:14,727 --> 00:20:19,403
Well, it seems I've skidded right off
the road this time and into a ditch.

369
00:20:19,567 --> 00:20:20,841
A deep one.

370
00:20:21,247 --> 00:20:25,604
Well, you could try
to throw it in reverse

371
00:20:25,767 --> 00:20:27,883
and spin your wheels for a while.

372
00:20:28,047 --> 00:20:32,438
Or you could get out into the ditch
and get yourself a little dirty.

373
00:20:32,607 --> 00:20:34,643
I see.

374
00:20:34,807 --> 00:20:37,002
Lana's the ditch, right?

375
00:20:40,207 --> 00:20:41,879
It's your metaphor.

376
00:20:43,567 --> 00:20:46,798
Well, I guess
I've got some thinking to do.

377
00:20:46,967 --> 00:20:48,480
Thanks for talking, Lilith.

378
00:20:49,287 --> 00:20:51,198
Any time.

379
00:20:51,767 --> 00:20:53,200
I love you, Frasier.

380
00:20:55,767 --> 00:20:57,644
I love you too.
