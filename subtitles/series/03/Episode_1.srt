1
00:00:09,275 --> 00:00:12,725
Anyway, Doc, I got this thing. 
It's, uh, got to do with women.

2
00:00:12,902 --> 00:00:15,688
Well, I sense you're having trouble finding Miss Right.

3
00:00:15,862 --> 00:00:18,980
What, are you nuts? I meet Miss Right most every night!

4
00:00:19,155 --> 00:00:24,360
Eager young college girls, tough career women hungry for a little R-and-R, if you know what I'm saying...

5
00:00:24,533 --> 00:00:27,699
Well, you're leaving precious little room for misinterpretation.  

6
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:31,911
But I sense, despite these frequent
dalliances, that you're still not truly happy.

7
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:36,620
Well, sure I am.  It's just that I lost a pinky ring in one of their houses.   

8
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:41,247
Star sapphire, beautiful thing.

9
00:00:41,418 --> 00:00:45,876
I figured if I went public with it on your show
I had a pretty good chance of getting it back.

10
00:00:47,921 --> 00:00:52,877
Well, Vinnie, it's obvious you know nothing
about this show, or how to treat women.

11
00:00:53,049 --> 00:00:56,796
But even more appalling, you know
even less about jewelry!

12
00:00:57,927 --> 00:01:02,421
A pinkie no more needs a ring than 
a neck needs a gold medallion!

13
00:01:02,596 --> 00:01:06,722
- Just shoot me, why don't you?
- I'd be delighted!

14
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:09,012
We'll be right back after this.

15
00:01:10,267 --> 00:01:13,136
Hi, Dr. Crane.

16
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:16,725
- He's driving me crazy!
- Well Roz, we can't all choose our admirers.

17
00:01:16,896 --> 00:01:21,437
It's gone way beyond the admiring stage.
Have you seen this petition he's got going around?

19
00:01:27,735 --> 00:01:33,605
It's to the talented producers of Star Trek
suggesting a new character.

20
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:38,239
"The all-powerful space vixen... Rozalinda!"

21
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:47,616
Four-breasted queen of the planet Rozniak!

22
00:01:47,788 --> 00:01:50,112
I'll sign that.

23
00:01:53,249 --> 00:01:56,699
Well, Roz, television will never improve
unless the viewers speak out!

24
00:01:56,876 --> 00:01:59,117
Thanks. I'd better go.

25
00:01:59,294 --> 00:02:02,875
- Well, live long and prosper!
- Oh, just go!

26
00:02:03,755 --> 00:02:05,793
I am the joke of the station.

27
00:02:05,964 --> 00:02:10,957
When I used to come in the morning the
guard would say,"Morning, Roz".
Now it's "All hail, Rozalinda!"

28
00:02:12,051 --> 00:02:14,588
Roz, I think you should be flattered.
Noel's attempt to immortalize you is-is akin to...

29
00:02:14,761 --> 00:02:18,294
a love poem written by 
Robert Browning to his wife.

30
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:22,763
Did he ever write a poem where he gave her two extra breasts?

31
00:02:22,932 --> 00:02:26,465
Well, I'd have to check my English
Lit notes, but I think not, no.

32
00:02:29,352 --> 00:02:31,427
Hello? Yes?

33
00:02:31,603 --> 00:02:34,473
Niles, Niles, slow down, I can hardly understand you!

34
00:02:34,647 --> 00:02:37,315
- What is it?
- Maris is missing!

35
00:02:37,482 --> 00:02:41,608
What? No, I don't think you should drag the koi pond! 

36
00:02:42,651 --> 00:02:44,773
Listen, I'll be right over!
All right, just hang tight!

37
00:02:44,944 --> 00:02:49,319
- Roz, Roz, how much time left in the show?
- No, you go, do whatever you have to do. I'll handle things here.

38
00:02:49,488 --> 00:02:53,947
- You're sure you can manage?
- If I can nurse quadruplets and still find
time to rule Rozniak, I can do anything!

39
00:02:59,202 --> 00:03:01,692
- All right, what's going on?
- Yeah, Maris is really gone.

40
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:06,577
- I'm on the phone with the station right now.
- Apparently she just vanished. No note, nothing.

41
00:03:07,707 --> 00:03:11,204
- Oh, Frasier, thank God you're here.
- Any news, Dr. Crane?

44
00:03:21,673 --> 00:03:24,376
But that was weeks ago!

45
00:03:24,549 --> 00:03:27,798
Well, there's no need to panic, Niles.
I'm sure she's all right.

46
00:03:27,968 --> 00:03:31,170
Oh, dear me... I don't want to alarm you Dr.Crane

47
00:03:31,345 --> 00:03:34,546
but I'm getting a very strong vibration off this.

49
00:03:38,307 --> 00:03:42,599
She's waving this poker around and 
screaming,"You thief! Get out!

50
00:03:42,768 --> 00:03:46,182
- You'll never get away with this!
- Wait...

51
00:03:46,353 --> 00:03:51,013
No, I remember. That's what she said to the
decorator when he tried to double-bill
her for the andirons.

52
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:55,683
I was wondering why the intruder was wearing Toreador pants.

53
00:03:55,858 --> 00:04:00,150
Yeah, Mike, I'm still here. Yeah, that's right, 
she's been missing three days.

54
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:05,773
Uh,excuse me? She's been missing for three
days and you're just panic-stricken now?

55
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:10,114
I only just realized it.

56
00:04:13,993 --> 00:04:17,277
The last two nights, I knocked on Maris's
bedroom door to wish her goodnight and 

57
00:04:17,495 --> 00:04:21,989
I was greeted with a chilly silence so,
naturally I assumed everything was status quo.

58
00:04:23,248 --> 00:04:27,789
Uh, thin.  Make that VERY thin.

59
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:29,868
Caucasian.

60
00:04:30,044 --> 00:04:32,664
VERY Caucasian.

61
00:04:32,837 --> 00:04:35,872
Oh God, what could be happening to her?

62
00:04:36,047 --> 00:04:38,667
Oh, wait, wait, you got something?
O.K., uh-huh, O.K.

63
00:04:40,383 --> 00:04:43,881
Mike ran a check on Maris's credit cards,
there's been a whole bunch of charges
in New York.

64
00:04:44,051 --> 00:04:48,592
Oh, God.  She's been kidnapped.
Someone's using her credit cards.

65
00:04:48,762 --> 00:04:50,635
Yeah, O.K., slow down. Armani...

66
00:04:50,805 --> 00:04:52,797
Valentino...

67
00:04:52,973 --> 00:04:55,759
Cartier... Tiffany...

68
00:04:55,933 --> 00:04:58,221
- Any restaurants?
- Any restaurants? Not a one.

69
00:04:58,393 --> 00:05:00,431
She's alive!

70
00:05:00,602 --> 00:05:04,349
- Oh, Niles!  You're certain!
- Oh, yes!

71
00:05:04,521 --> 00:05:08,731
From that list, she's recreating her infamous 
"Sakes alive, I'm thirty-five" shopping spree!

72
00:05:08,898 --> 00:05:11,684
O.K., Mike, thanks a lot. Yeah, I owe you. Bye.

73
00:05:11,858 --> 00:05:16,150
- Oh, Dr. Crane, I'm so relieved.
- Oh, so am I. I'm exhausted. 

74
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:18,774
I was so scared.

75
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:27,399
Frasier? What's wrong?
You look positively uncelebratory.

76
00:05:27,575 --> 00:05:29,947
Aren't you glad Maris is O.K.?

77
00:05:30,118 --> 00:05:34,245
Of course I am.  It's just that...

78
00:05:34,413 --> 00:05:38,622
well, here you are, all panic-stricken and 
scared to death, and she's off on some 
shopping trip!

79
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:40,829
Don't you find that the least bit upsetting?

80
00:05:42,584 --> 00:05:46,793
Yes, I suppose her behavior was a tad inconsiderate.

81
00:05:46,961 --> 00:05:51,787
- Well, she left without so much
as a note or a phone call!
- Frasier, stay out of this. 
It's between Niles and his wife.

82
00:05:51,964 --> 00:05:54,798
You know, I'm sorry, Dad, but this is not the
first time we've experienced Maris's selfish behavior!

83
00:05:54,966 --> 00:05:58,796
She always puts her needs above his!
She never attends family functions!

84
00:05:58,968 --> 00:06:01,173
Doesn't that make you angry?

85
00:06:01,344 --> 00:06:03,834
Well, over the years I've learned to 
accept Maris's eccentricities.

86
00:06:04,012 --> 00:06:09,170
- Oh, she's not being eccentric.
She's being arrogant and selfish!
- If he says he's not angry, he's not angry.

87
00:06:09,348 --> 00:06:11,803
- And even if I were angry, what would you have me do?
- Let it out!

88
00:06:11,975 --> 00:06:14,761
Well,I am letting it out! I'm getting hives!

89
00:06:16,352 --> 00:06:18,723
Well, that is a triumph of self-expression!

90
00:06:18,895 --> 00:06:22,345
why don't you just let out some of the words that you're dying to say?

91
00:06:22,522 --> 00:06:27,017
Oh God, I am so sick of you and your relentless psychobabble!

92
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:30,226
A-ha! You're not angry at me! That was directed at Maris!

93
00:06:30,402 --> 00:06:33,816
Nope, that was for you! This is for Maris!

94
00:06:33,987 --> 00:06:36,524
Whoa!  O.K., all right, Niles, now you got it out of your system!

95
00:06:36,697 --> 00:06:39,103
Yes, but it felt so good!  Let me do one more!

96
00:06:39,282 --> 00:06:42,981
All right, Niles, this is good, this is healthy! But you've got to channel it!  You must talk to Maris!

97
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:47,949
Oh no, wait! That's beautiful! Here, this one's hideous!

98
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,534
- Hey, I gave him that for a wedding present!
- Well, all right, here!

99
00:06:53,831 --> 00:06:58,041
Dios Mio!
Oh, Marta! This feels wonderful! You must try it!

100
00:07:03,086 --> 00:07:05,161
I meant at your house.

101
00:07:08,006 --> 00:07:10,460
- Oh my God, it's Maris!
- Maris?! What?!

102
00:07:10,632 --> 00:07:15,126
- You said she was in New York!
- Well, I don't know, she probably flew back!

103
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:18,218
All right, all right, no one panic, there's an easy solution to this!

104
00:07:18,386 --> 00:07:20,959
Frasier, bash me on the head with this, we'll tell Maris there was a break-in! 

105
00:07:21,138 --> 00:07:23,213
Niles, Niles, stop it!

106
00:07:23,389 --> 00:07:26,887
- God, you are the damaged party here, not Maris!
- But-but-but-but the mess!

107
00:07:27,058 --> 00:07:31,220
This mess is the physical manifestation of years of repressed anger!

108
00:07:31,394 --> 00:07:35,224
It's time to draw a line in the sand and say,"I have had enough!"

109
00:07:35,396 --> 00:07:38,810
My God, man, show her your mess!

110
00:07:45,652 --> 00:07:49,398
You're right. It's time I told Maris I will not tolerate this behavior.

111
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:52,143
I'm going up there and I'm going to demand an apology!

112
00:07:52,322 --> 00:07:54,360
Good for you!

113
00:07:56,866 --> 00:07:59,652
I always hated that dynasty.

114
00:08:03,328 --> 00:08:06,078
- How're you feeling, Mr. Crane?
- I'm fine, I wish you'd quit asking me.

115
00:08:06,246 --> 00:08:11,155
Well, it's a reasonable question for a man who just ate a cut of prime rib the size of a hatbox.

116
00:08:11,332 --> 00:08:14,996
Well, whose fault's that?  You're the one who was too embarrassed to walk out with a doggie bag. 

117
00:08:15,168 --> 00:08:19,294
For what it cost, that meat was coming with me, one way or another!

118
00:08:21,463 --> 00:08:25,673
Goodness, we've been gone three hours. Probably have a dog with a full bladder in there.

119
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,295
Lord, let's hope so.

120
00:08:34,637 --> 00:08:36,675
Hey, Daphne, how do you feel about taking him for a walk?

121
00:08:36,846 --> 00:08:41,802
I just want to get in there and unbuckle my pants since I wasn't allowed to at the restaurant!

122
00:08:41,974 --> 00:08:45,424
Oh, sure.  We all know how Eddie needs his exercise.

123
00:08:45,601 --> 00:08:50,308
we wouldn't want all that fatty meat he eats clogging up his aging arteries until his poor old heart gives out.

124
00:08:50,479 --> 00:08:54,806
Oh and, uh, why don't you pick up some half-and-half at the corner store too?

125
00:08:55,773 --> 00:08:58,477
Get moving, old man!

126
00:09:03,403 --> 00:09:05,809
- There y'are!
- Niles?

127
00:09:10,115 --> 00:09:13,612
Sorry to startle you, I let myself in. Want a beer?

128
00:09:13,783 --> 00:09:16,487
No.

129
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:19,825
I have to thank you for putting me in touch with my anger.

130
00:09:19,995 --> 00:09:25,153
I had no idea how therapeutic it was to just pick something up and smash it!

131
00:09:34,587 --> 00:09:38,713
Well... you're welcome, Niles.  But, um, how did things go with Maris?

132
00:09:44,467 --> 00:09:47,039
I marched into her room and demanded an explanation.

133
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:50,052
It seems that over lunch with her garden club,

134
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:53,919
Maris heard that the new Couture lines had arrived in New York.

135
00:09:54,097 --> 00:09:57,180
So she hied her way to the airport, and in her haste she forgot to leave me a note.

136
00:09:57,349 --> 00:10:00,633
- Unbelievable!
- Just thinking about it makes me furious!

137
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:03,299
- Really?
- Yes!

138
00:10:09,689 --> 00:10:14,065
So I told her, Maris, you were inconsiderate,

139
00:10:14,233 --> 00:10:18,940
and when you are ready to apologize, I can be reached at Frasier's!

140
00:10:19,111 --> 00:10:21,862
Then I stormed out and slammed the door.

141
00:10:22,029 --> 00:10:26,689
Of course, it was that fourteenth-century Bavarian cathedral door, so I had to 
get two of the servants to help me slam it.

142
00:10:26,865 --> 00:10:31,525
But what it lacked in spontaneity it made up for in resonance!

143
00:10:32,452 --> 00:10:36,993
Well, Niles, you know I'm not usually one to toot my own horn, but I think in this case I was on the mark.

144
00:10:37,163 --> 00:10:39,831
- You feel good, don't you?
- I feel great!

145
00:10:39,998 --> 00:10:42,155
- You feel empowered?
- So empowered!

146
00:10:42,332 --> 00:10:46,115
- And you'd like to switch to wine now, wouldn't you?
- Oh, please.

147
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:52,541
Hello?  Oh, hello, Maris.

148
00:10:52,713 --> 00:10:55,001
Yes, Niles is here.  

150
00:11:03,344 --> 00:11:05,300
Hello, Maris.

151
00:11:06,804 --> 00:11:10,966
Mmm-Hmm. Well, I know you're not used to me speaking to you that way. That's rather the point, wouldn't you agree?

152
00:11:12,015 --> 00:11:13,972
Uh-huh.

153
00:11:14,141 --> 00:11:19,299
I see. Well, thank you. I know this was a very difficult call for you to make. Goodbye.

155
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,977
- It's no use. She still won't talk to me.
- Oh, just give her time to cool off.  

156
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:39,193
Call her again in the morning.

157
00:11:39,364 --> 00:11:45,731
Geez, you must be exhausted, Niles. Why don't you call it a day and get some rest,huh?

158
00:11:45,909 --> 00:11:50,450
- Do you have a blanket for me?
- Oh now, Niles, you've been going through a rough time lately, you're not sleeping on any couch.

159
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:52,825
You can sleep in Frasier's bed.

160
00:11:55,539 --> 00:11:57,578
- What?
- You're sure it wouldn't be too much trouble?

161
00:11:57,749 --> 00:12:01,247
No trouble. I wouldn't want to impose.
No, don't worry about it, you're family.

162
00:12:01,417 --> 00:12:03,623
Thank you.

163
00:12:07,171 --> 00:12:09,577
Well, that was very generous of you.

164
00:12:09,755 --> 00:12:14,047
- Well, it's the least you can do after getting him kicked out of the house.
- Well, Dad, I was just trying to do what's right for him.

165
00:12:14,216 --> 00:12:17,299
Well, trust me. I handled domestic disputes for thirty years.

166
00:12:17,468 --> 00:12:19,922
The first rule is, don't take sides.

167
00:12:20,094 --> 00:12:23,592
- Well, it's just a little difficult when it happens to be your own brother.
- Well, that's the second rule.

168
00:12:23,763 --> 00:12:27,012
When it's your own family, keep your nose out of their personal problems.

169
00:12:28,724 --> 00:12:32,590
- This is starting to make some sense.
- Well, maybe you should listen to your old man once in a while.

170
00:12:32,768 --> 00:12:36,301
- I mean, I'm not a psychiatrist or anything, I'm just a cop.
- But a darn good one.

171
00:12:36,478 --> 00:12:41,185
- You're going to talk to Maris, aren't you?
- I'll be back in an hour.

172
00:12:49,319 --> 00:12:53,315
- Don't ignore me, Marta!
- Go away!

173
00:12:54,488 --> 00:12:56,776
Let me in, I need to speak with Mrs. Crane!

174
00:12:56,948 --> 00:13:01,774
Missy Crane say, no you Dr. Crane, no other Dr. Crane,

175
00:13:01,951 --> 00:13:04,108
and no Crane with a cane!

176
00:13:05,828 --> 00:13:11,068
- Well, at least tell her that I'm here!
- She know. Everybody know.

177
00:13:13,207 --> 00:13:16,491
Maris? Maris, we need to talk!

178
00:13:16,667 --> 00:13:20,794
Oh, look, look, I know you're up there, I can see you through the shutters!

179
00:13:20,961 --> 00:13:23,795
All right, if you won't talk, listen!

180
00:13:23,963 --> 00:13:27,745
Niles didn't ask me to come here, I 
came because I care about both of you.

181
00:13:27,923 --> 00:13:31,706
I realize that Niles spoke to 
you rather harshly today.

182
00:13:31,884 --> 00:13:35,631
Truth be told, is it was I that urged him to express his anger.

183
00:13:35,803 --> 00:13:38,886
As hard as it was for you to listen to such criticism,

184
00:13:39,055 --> 00:13:43,430
you're a fair-minded woman and you must concede that he had a right to be upset!

185
00:13:45,683 --> 00:13:51,221
Oh! Oh, Maris! By opening that window you're opening up a window to a long and happy marriage, that's good!

186
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:08,319
All right, you're expressing your anger! That's good, too!

187
00:14:08,488 --> 00:14:14,108
But, listen, in spite of that last little outburst,I am not going to leave here until we've had some sort of a breakthrough!

188
00:14:16,617 --> 00:14:19,735
Well, I see our time is up, I'll let myself out!

189
00:14:22,287 --> 00:14:24,611
I know you're there. 

190
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:29,743
After last night, frankly, I've had quite enough of your kind.

191
00:14:32,126 --> 00:14:34,164
You can stare all you like. I'm not going to give you anything to eat.

192
00:14:37,295 --> 00:14:43,331
Oh, all right, here.  You might as well finish off this god-awful Shepherd's Pie that Daphne made.

193
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,838
Lord knows it isn't fit for humans.

194
00:14:54,471 --> 00:14:59,012
Did that sound like "humans?" I said "Mormons."

195
00:15:00,224 --> 00:15:04,137
- You're not at your quickest first thing in the morning, are you?
- Well, it was a rough night.

196
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:07,345
Well, maybe next time you'll listen to your old man and not come between a husband and his wife.

197
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:12,310
And here's Dad, all sleep-refreshed and bright-eyed, ready to resume his lecture!

198
00:15:13,398 --> 00:15:16,314
Oh look, your brother left us a note.

199
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:23,772
Dear Dad, Frasier, & Daphne: when you wake up this morning I'll be gone.

200
00:15:23,946 --> 00:15:28,238
Thank you for all your help, but I don't want to be a burden any longer.

201
00:15:28,407 --> 00:15:33,113
You don't think... no, I'm sure this is all completely harmless.

202
00:15:33,284 --> 00:15:37,114
Yeah, my gun's still locked up...and the door to the balcony's closed...

203
00:15:37,286 --> 00:15:42,623
And we all know that Daphne's Shepherd's Pie is still in the refrigerator.

204
00:15:45,499 --> 00:15:50,918
Hi-ho, everyone! What are you all doing inside on such a beautiful, clear autumn day?

205
00:15:51,086 --> 00:15:53,042
Niles, you seem awfully chipper this morning.

206
00:15:53,212 --> 00:15:56,959
Well, I woke up this morning and I had a realization.Like it or not, my life is changing.

207
00:15:57,131 --> 00:16:00,961
I'm single now, so I went out and rented a bachelor pad. Ooh, is that coffee?

208
00:16:01,133 --> 00:16:04,086
- Don't you think that's jumping the gun a little bit?
- Oh no, Dad.

209
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:07,425
Maris, uh, ordered me to get my stuff out of there by sundown,

210
00:16:07,595 --> 00:16:11,721
or else she'd turn it over to a church bazaar.

211
00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:15,339
Oh, and I got these jeans!

212
00:16:16,808 --> 00:16:20,010
Right?  Right?  And I'm starting a goatee, and I'm thinking of joining a gym, 

213
00:16:20,185 --> 00:16:24,928
but I don't know whether aerobics or weight training is the quickest route to "buff!"  Any thoughts?

214
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,399
One thought: seek help!

215
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:39,393
Niles, you've just been through a very traumatic experience here and you are deep in denial here.

216
00:16:39,571 --> 00:16:43,732
You are going through some very extreme emotions right now, and rather than feeling them, you're denying they even exist.

217
00:16:43,906 --> 00:16:48,152
I'm not denying my feelings.  I'm so in tune with my emotions that I was able to move through them quickly.

218
00:16:48,326 --> 00:16:53,365
In fact, I've logged them all in my journal. 

219
00:16:53,537 --> 00:16:59,074
Let's see, where are we? Here...5 AM: Blissful confusion. Something's happened, but what?

220
00:17:01,124 --> 00:17:05,535
5:01: Ah, yes. An overwhelming sense of emptiness and despair.

221
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:07,951
5:07... this one's hard to read...

222
00:17:08,128 --> 00:17:10,369
oh, right! Wept uncontrollably.

223
00:17:10,546 --> 00:17:13,499
6:15: All cried out.  Hungry now.

224
00:17:13,673 --> 00:17:18,000
Ate entire box of Frosted Flakes, they're gr-r-r-reat!

225
00:17:20,969 --> 00:17:24,301
So don't you tell me I'm not in touch with my emotions!

226
00:17:26,305 --> 00:17:30,004
9:45: get out the butterfly net.

227
00:17:34,893 --> 00:17:39,849
It's not easy for me to say goodbye, especially after so many years all we've shared, all that we've meant to one another.

228
00:17:40,021 --> 00:17:45,226
Jean-Pierre, Marie, Bernard, thank you for your years of devoted service.  

229
00:17:45,399 --> 00:17:48,185
As a personal favor, please look after Mrs. Crane.

230
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:51,394
It'll be just you and her from now on.

231
00:17:53,153 --> 00:17:57,019
Uh, the staff, they have a question: Can we come with you?

232
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:02,861
Marta, I'm afraid this is a road I must walk alone.

233
00:18:05,868 --> 00:18:09,651
- Must be very painful, isn't it?
- Painful doesn't begin to describe it.

234
00:18:09,829 --> 00:18:11,951
But they're strong, they'll get over it.

235
00:18:12,122 --> 00:18:14,160
Oh, watch that, careful with those!

236
00:18:14,331 --> 00:18:16,619
Look at him, Dad. My God, he's locked in denial!

237
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:21,866
Oh, for God's sake. First you get him to move out, then when he does he's not upset enough for you. There's no pleasing you!

238
00:18:22,044 --> 00:18:25,625
Well, what would please me would be to see him actually experience some real emotion!

239
00:18:25,796 --> 00:18:27,835
My God, he's walking through this thing like a zombie!

240
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:30,081
Well, that's everything. Shall we?

241
00:18:30,257 --> 00:18:32,295
- You know, there's no hurry, Niles.
- Well, actually there is.

242
00:18:32,466 --> 00:18:36,676
I have aerobics at five, and then I'm meeting with my decorator at six-thirty. Off we go!

243
00:18:39,053 --> 00:18:42,053
Have I got my wallet? Yes.

244
00:18:43,514 --> 00:18:45,589
Have I got my checkbook?

245
00:18:45,765 --> 00:18:47,140
Yes.

246
00:18:47,308 --> 00:18:51,932
Have I lost my MIND?! I can't leave! This is my home! You're not taking me!

247
00:18:52,102 --> 00:18:55,351
- Niles, Niles, open the door!
- Nope, nope, bye-bye! Thanks for coming, 

248
00:18:55,521 --> 00:18:57,808
I'll tell Maris you sent your best!

249
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:01,928
- Now, Niles, calm down.
- No, no, don't calm down! Let it out! This is very healing!

250
00:19:02,108 --> 00:19:05,938
- Don't you ever let up?
- Look, everything's gonna be fine.

251
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:08,267
No, it isn't. There's no life for me out there!

252
00:19:08,444 --> 00:19:10,851
You're just excited.
I don't want to be a bachelor. I didn't like it the first time.

253
00:19:11,029 --> 00:19:15,606
- Niles, look, just sit down for a second, O.K.?
- Where, Frasier?

254
00:19:15,782 --> 00:19:21,948
Here, in the chair that Maris and I picked out on our honeymoon in Vienna?

255
00:19:23,244 --> 00:19:27,192
Or here, where I sit Sunday mornings playing Mahler 

256
00:19:27,372 --> 00:19:29,696
while Maris dabs at her watercolors?

257
00:19:29,873 --> 00:19:36,407
Perhaps here, where we sipped champagne on our last anniversary.

258
00:19:36,585 --> 00:19:39,454
Guess that really was our last anniversary.

259
00:19:39,628 --> 00:19:41,999
- Oh, Niles...
- Dr. Crane?

260
00:19:42,171 --> 00:19:45,254
- Yes, Marta?
- Missy Crane give me message for you:

261
00:19:45,423 --> 00:19:49,336
if you say is all your fault, you no have to leave.

262
00:19:53,636 --> 00:19:57,383
- ...I can stay?
- She waiting upstairs.

263
00:20:00,973 --> 00:20:04,507
Niles, before you make your decision,

264
00:20:04,684 --> 00:20:08,265
just make sure that you're remembering things the way they really were.

265
00:20:08,436 --> 00:20:11,471
Yes, you bought that chair on your honeymoon in Vienna. But remember,

266
00:20:11,646 --> 00:20:14,646
you wanted to buy the chair that you saw in Paris.

267
00:20:14,814 --> 00:20:17,684
Yes, you sit at the piano every Sunday morning and play Mahler for Maris.

268
00:20:17,858 --> 00:20:21,106
But you hate Mahler!

269
00:20:21,276 --> 00:20:23,647
Besides Maris, who doesn't?!

270
00:20:23,819 --> 00:20:25,858
Look, just give him a little air here...

271
00:20:26,029 --> 00:20:29,859
Look, all I'm saying is that along with the good things in your marriage, there were problems

272
00:20:30,031 --> 00:20:32,402
things you said you couldn't live with anymore.

273
00:20:32,574 --> 00:20:34,613
Now if you want those to change, you have got to stand up to her.

274
00:20:34,784 --> 00:20:39,906
If you back down now, you will go through the rest of your life feeling weak 

275
00:20:40,078 --> 00:20:46,789
and small because you never had the courage to say:I will not let you treat me like this, Lilith! ...Maris!

276
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:59,622
Well, I've lost all credibility here. Dad, would you please say something?

278
00:21:02,966 --> 00:21:07,258
- I wouldn't mind knowing what you think.
- It doesn't matter what I think..

279
00:21:07,427 --> 00:21:10,213
What matters is what you think.

280
00:21:10,387 --> 00:21:14,217
Now if you want to walk up those stairs, we'll support you. If you want to go out that door, we'll support you there, too.

281
00:21:21,476 --> 00:21:23,931
What are you, nuts?!

282
00:21:25,478 --> 00:21:28,597
You're gonna go up there and grovel to that woman after what she did to you?!

283
00:21:30,106 --> 00:21:34,351
Actually, I was just going to get my car keys.

284
00:21:34,525 --> 00:21:37,608
But thanks for the impartial advice, Dad.
