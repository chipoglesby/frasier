1
00:00:11,197 --> 00:00:12,818
Slow down!

2
00:00:12,818 --> 00:00:15,862
Hey Daphne, guess what Eddie ate in the park today?

3
00:00:15,862 --> 00:00:18,138
Ooh let's see. A hot dog wrapper?

4
00:00:18,138 --> 00:00:19,475
No. Guess again.

5
00:00:19,475 --> 00:00:21,245
A cigarette butt?
No. Guess again.

6
00:00:21,245 --> 00:00:23,252
Apple core?
No. Guess again.

7
00:00:23,252 --> 00:00:26,301
Oh really, must you two play this ridiculous game?

8
00:00:26,301 --> 00:00:29,473
She makes some feeble stab and you say "No. Guess again."

9
00:00:29,473 --> 00:00:38,361
Then she starts flailing away with even more ludicrous answers, all the while you chanting
"Guess again", until she's gibbering like some auctioneer with a bad bladder.

10
00:00:38,361 --> 00:00:41,591
Then you finally reveal the answer at which point nobody even cares.

11
00:00:41,591 --> 00:00:44,789
I'm not sure which one of us got the worst of that, but I think it was you.

12
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:47,401
Guess again.

13
00:00:53,363 --> 00:00:54,850
Niles.

14
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:58,326
There's a half-eaten lizard in your elevator!

15
00:00:58,326 --> 00:01:02,626
And that's the last hint you're getting.

16
00:01:02,626 --> 00:01:05,871
Oh Frasier, I had a breakthrough today with one of my compulsive gamblers

17
00:01:05,871 --> 00:01:08,662
and he gave me two tickets to the racetrack on Saturday.

18
00:01:08,662 --> 00:01:10,952
It's a luxury box ?I though you might want to go.

19
00:01:10,952 --> 00:01:14,065
Oh I would love to Niles. Why don't you want to use them?

20
00:01:14,065 --> 00:01:16,805
Well, the jockeys if you must know.

21
00:01:16,805 --> 00:01:17,983
What?

22
00:01:17,983 --> 00:01:27,559
Diminutive, underweight figures in expensive silks wielding riding crops. It just reminded me too much of Maris.

23
00:01:27,559 --> 00:01:30,679
Dad, what about you? I've never known you to turn down the horses.

24
00:01:30,679 --> 00:01:32,931
Ah, sorry. I've got poker with the guys.

25
00:01:32,931 --> 00:01:38,097
Oh well then. I'll just call one of my friends.

26
00:01:41,538 --> 00:01:44,237
Jeez. This is sort of embarrassing.

27
00:01:44,237 --> 00:01:46,693
The first three names on my list are all back in Boston.

28
00:01:46,693 --> 00:01:48,500
What about someone from your wine club?

29
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:52,515
Oh well truth be told Daphne, those people are insufferable bores unless they have a glass in their hands.

30
00:01:52,515 --> 00:01:55,971
Sherry, Niles?
Please.

31
00:01:55,971 --> 00:01:59,353
Oh I know. How about Ed O'Hanlon?

32
00:01:59,353 --> 00:02:00,929
Moved away last year.

33
00:02:00,929 --> 00:02:05,340
Ooh, how about Edmund Kelly? If I know old Ed he'd never leave Seattle.

34
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:09,146
Indeed not. They buried him here three years ago.

35
00:02:09,146 --> 00:02:12,382
Dear me. Really? I'll miss him.

36
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:18,720
Yes. Three years from now when you think of him again  there'll be a void!

37
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,346
My God how did this happen?

38
00:02:20,346 --> 00:02:22,863
I've been back here for two years and I've yet to forge any new friendships.

39
00:02:22,863 --> 00:02:24,548
You'd better watch it Frasier.

40
00:02:24,548 --> 00:02:37,805
Next thing you know you're gonna be like one of these old people who are so set in their ways
that they're only happy hanging around with people who are the same as they are.

41
00:02:37,805 --> 00:02:42,437
What exactly is your point Dad? That I've lost my knack for making friends?

44
00:02:48,952 --> 00:02:51,940
The two of you always holed up in that damned garage ?

45
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:55,198
at least until you burned it down.

46
00:02:55,198 --> 00:02:56,646
You burned down the garage?

47
00:02:56,646 --> 00:03:02,464
Well, between Frasier and his Bunsen burner and me and my mosquito repellent…in

48
00:03:02,464 --> 00:03:05,183
retrospect it was unavoidable!

49
00:03:05,183 --> 00:03:09,057
Still, you know Dad, I did have friends in college and back in Boston.

50
00:03:09,057 --> 00:03:11,922
It's only since I moved to Seattle that I've started falling back on Niles.

51
00:03:11,922 --> 00:03:15,230
Ooh ?"falling back on Niles"?

52
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:18,855
Niles, you know what I mean. Settling for what's comfortable and familiar.

53
00:03:18,855 --> 00:03:22,485
My God, you and I can go out together and I know what you're thinking before you even say it.

54
00:03:22,485 --> 00:03:28,707
Well then I'm sorry you had to hear that Frasier!

55
00:03:28,707 --> 00:03:31,888
You know what? This would make a wonderful topic for my show.

56
00:03:31,888 --> 00:03:34,822
"Making New Friends" What are we so afraid of?

57
00:03:34,822 --> 00:03:36,704
Why do you make everything so complicated?

58
00:03:36,704 --> 00:03:40,919
You wanna meet somebody new? You just walk up to him, stick out your hand and say "Hi. How you doing?"

59
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:44,491
Thank you Dad. I can always count on you not to overthink something.

60
00:03:44,491 --> 00:03:45,720
Thanks

61
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,840
Hey!

62
00:03:50,251 --> 00:03:52,346
MAYBE JUST A SHAMPOO AND SET

63
00:03:52,346 --> 00:03:54,829
So why is it we have so much trouble making friends?

64
00:03:54,829 --> 00:03:57,179
Is it because we've become closed off?

65
00:03:57,179 --> 00:03:59,789
No longer want to reach out to our fellow man?

66
00:03:59,789 --> 00:04:04,605
Well I'd like to think that if one of you listeners out there happened to see me on the street
you'd feel free to walk right on up to me and?

67
00:04:04,605 --> 00:04:10,469
Excuse me Dr. Crane, we have to stop for a very important public service announcement

68
00:04:10,469 --> 00:04:13,625
HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MIND?

69
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:16,249
You're opening yourself up to every creep out there!

70
00:04:16,249 --> 00:04:18,915
Oh Roz that's exactly the kind of cynicism I'm talking about.

71
00:04:18,915 --> 00:04:21,656
I, for one, happen to believe in the kindness of strangers.

72
00:04:21,656 --> 00:04:24,479
Well I believe in the strangeness of strangers!

73
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,862
Three seconds.

74
00:04:26,862 --> 00:04:30,084
Hi, we're back with the topic of friendship.

75
00:04:30,084 --> 00:04:33,092
Now let's go to the switchboard. Roz, who's on line one?

76
00:04:33,092 --> 00:04:40,306
Good news Dr. Crane. It's Gerard from Stanwood. A new friend.

77
00:04:40,306 --> 00:04:42,412
Hello Gerard. I'm listening.

78
00:04:42,412 --> 00:04:45,324
Well I called for another reason Dr. Crane.

79
00:04:45,324 --> 00:04:50,454
But what you just said really moved me. I wish more people felt that way.

80
00:04:50,454 --> 00:04:54,498
Well thank you Gerard. I sense a kindred spirit.

81
00:04:54,498 --> 00:04:57,786
Maybe we could get together some time? Have a beer?

82
00:04:57,786 --> 00:05:07,992
Maybe I could…you know…comb your hair?

83
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:11,933
Well thank you so much for your offer of friendship George but

84
00:05:11,933 --> 00:05:17,877
I really don't have five thousand dollars to invest in your French fries vending machine.

85
00:05:17,877 --> 00:05:25,274
And for the sake of those who do invest I suggest, Sir, that you find a better name than "The Spuddy Buddy".

86
00:05:25,274 --> 00:05:30,236
This is Dr. Frasier Crane wishing you all good mental health.

87
00:05:30,236 --> 00:05:33,574
I mean that today more than ever!

88
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:38,518
I just love it when I'm right. It makes the day so good.

89
00:05:38,518 --> 00:05:39,717
You stacked the deck didn't you?

90
00:05:39,717 --> 00:05:43,980
Oh please. You should have heard some of the calls I didn't put through let alone these faxes.

91
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:46,077
Read some of these. They're sick.

92
00:05:46,077 --> 00:05:51,893
Oh Roz my listeners are not sick?

93
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:55,660
Although this one does bear watching!

94
00:05:56,629 --> 00:05:58,635
Here's one that has promise.

95
00:05:58,635 --> 00:06:00,951
"Dear Dr. Crane. I never thought I'd write a letter like this

96
00:06:00,951 --> 00:06:03,296
but I was moved by today's show.

97
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:10,343
As a photographer I come into contact with new people on a daily basis
yet I often find it difficult to make that one on one connection.

98
00:06:10,343 --> 00:06:14,575
However your words offered hope and I just wanted to say thank you.

99
00:06:14,575 --> 00:06:16,989
Sincerely. Bob Reynolds."

100
00:06:16,989 --> 00:06:18,976
Doesn't sound too wacky.

101
00:06:18,976 --> 00:06:21,507
You know what? I think I'm going to give Mr. Bob Reynolds a call.

102
00:06:21,507 --> 00:06:22,890
Are you nuts?

103
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:28,224
He could be a raving psychopath with a trunkful of decomposing squirrels.

104
00:06:28,224 --> 00:06:30,464
Oh rubbish Roz. I'm going to call him.

105
00:06:30,464 --> 00:06:33,260
Where did you come up with such a disgusting image?

106
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:36,842
Meet Garth from Tacoma.

107
00:06:40,623 --> 00:06:43,986
BUTANE AND THE BEAST

108
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:47,124
You're late today but I'm glad you're here. I need your help

109
00:06:47,124 --> 00:06:51,196
My designer is ready to mutiny if I don't pick a fabric for my new couch.

110
00:06:51,196 --> 00:06:54,038
Now I've brought lots of swatches so make yourself comfortable.

111
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:58,977
Frankly Niles I'm not here to see you. I'm meeting a new friend.

112
00:06:58,977 --> 00:07:00,112
A new friend?

113
00:07:00,112 --> 00:07:04,815
Yes, you remember I was talking about widening my circle of friends.

114
00:07:04,815 --> 00:07:09,257
Oh I see. No more "falling back on Niles"

115
00:07:09,257 --> 00:07:13,398
It's not that I'm trying to replace you Niles. It's just that Bob and I?

116
00:07:13,398 --> 00:07:18,363
Bob? You're dumping me for someone named Bob?

117
00:07:18,363 --> 00:07:20,566
Niles I am not dumping you.

118
00:07:20,566 --> 00:07:23,787
I'm just worried that Bob might feel awkward meeting the two of us.

119
00:07:23,787 --> 00:07:27,956
Oh well we wouldn't want to make Bob feel uncomfortable now would we?

120
00:07:27,956 --> 00:07:32,111
I mean after all I've only been your brother for...38 years now.

121
00:07:32,111 --> 00:07:36,532
What does that mean when there's the possibility that Bob may feel awkward?

122
00:07:36,532 --> 00:07:38,678
There's a man over there who says he's waiting for you.

123
00:07:38,678 --> 00:07:42,038
No doubt the much ballyhooed Bob!

124
00:07:42,038 --> 00:07:43,174
Niles.

125
00:07:43,174 --> 00:07:45,274
Oh it's all right. It's all right. I'll go quietly.

126
00:07:45,274 --> 00:07:46,949
Don't worry about me. I'll be fine.

127
00:07:46,949 --> 00:07:48,132
I'll just go home to my Maris.

128
00:07:48,132 --> 00:07:53,087
Oh that's right!

129
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,019
Bob?
Dr. Crane.

130
00:07:57,019 --> 00:07:58,505
No, please..Call me Frasier.

131
00:07:58,505 --> 00:08:00,815
Frasier then. I'm glad you called.

132
00:08:00,815 --> 00:08:05,466
Oh..yes..Coffee please. Well uh

133
00:08:05,466 --> 00:08:09,292
-So.
-So.

134
00:08:09,292 --> 00:08:12,114
So. Listen, thank you for your fax.

135
00:08:12,114 --> 00:08:15,563
I listen to your show all the time. I think you're brilliant.

136
00:08:15,563 --> 00:08:17,341
You're probably sick of hearing that though right?

137
00:08:17,341 --> 00:08:21,767
One would think but it's my cross.

138
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:24,099
That's the thing I love about your show.

139
00:08:24,099 --> 00:08:26,595
You're not just serious. You can be funny.

140
00:08:26,595 --> 00:08:30,446
Well, I believe humour can be a therapeutic tool.

141
00:08:30,446 --> 00:08:34,739
Against the assault of laughter nothing can stand.

142
00:08:34,739 --> 00:08:38,230
Mark Twain. "The Mysterious Stranger". I have a first edition.

143
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:39,716
I'm a collector myself.

144
00:08:39,716 --> 00:08:44,591
You know I was a bit trepidatious about this experiment Bob, but

145
00:08:44,591 --> 00:08:47,206
I'm feeling a real simpatico here.
Yeah, me too.

146
00:08:47,206 --> 00:08:51,837
I'm going to go out on a limb. What do you say once we finish these coffees we treat ourselves to a proper dinner?

147
00:08:51,837 --> 00:08:53,274
Hey that sounds great.

148
00:08:53,274 --> 00:08:56,171
OK. Say, what are you reading?

149
00:08:56,171 --> 00:09:01,823
It's my bible. "The Big Book of Barbecue" by Jeff Filgo.

150
00:09:01,823 --> 00:09:05,127
He's a Texan. Of course all Texans think they invented barbecue.

151
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:07,960
Arrogant bastards!

152
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,083
You like barbecue?

153
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:15,288
Well…um…national holiday... 4th of July.

154
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:17,769
You know the secret to good barbecue?

155
00:09:17,769 --> 00:09:19,649
Mesquite.

156
00:09:19,649 --> 00:09:23,930
And the secret to mesquite is you gotta soak them in water for 10 minutes.

157
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:26,589
On special occasions I'll soak them in beer.

158
00:09:26,589 --> 00:09:30,353
Once I soaked them in Sake for that "flavour of the Far East".

159
00:09:30,353 --> 00:09:33,458
You know in Japan they call their barbecues "hibachis"?

160
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:38,377
The arrogant bastards!

161
00:09:38,377 --> 00:09:40,634
I'm digging my own barbecue pit right now?

162
00:09:40,634 --> 00:09:43,201
…my speciality is the Shian Smoky Quail.

163
00:09:43,201 --> 00:09:46,557
The trick is a high engulfing flame. Like a forest fire.

164
00:09:46,557 --> 00:09:51,201
Of course they call forest fires "nature's barbecue".

165
00:09:51,201 --> 00:09:59,520
You know my co-workers call me "Shish-ka-Bob"?

166
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,354
Well Bob.

167
00:10:01,354 --> 00:10:04,879
Do you have any charcoal free interests?

168
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:06,863
Yeah I'm a professional photographer.

169
00:10:06,863 --> 00:10:08,434
The camera never lies.

170
00:10:08,434 --> 00:10:12,598
I'm a bit of a camera buff myself.
What's your trade? Photo journalist?

171
00:10:12,598 --> 00:10:19,491
I take kids portraits at Value-Mart Where your dollar buys more!

172
00:10:19,491 --> 00:10:23,627
You know what? Why don't we talk about this over dinner?

173
00:10:23,627 --> 00:10:25,570
Right..

174
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:32,178
You know, Bob, about that dinner?

175
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,696
How about Tex-Mex?

176
00:10:36,696 --> 00:10:41,187
You're talking my language.

177
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:51,644
No you don't.

178
00:10:51,644 --> 00:10:58,179
I'm fixing you a breakfast drink with fresh fruit, yoghurt, carob, pitted prunes.

179
00:10:58,179 --> 00:11:00,893
A healthy body makes for a sunny disposition.

180
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:05,469
You want sunny? Let me have my fritter.

181
00:11:05,469 --> 00:11:09,522
Oh shush.

182
00:11:11,551 --> 00:11:13,535
There we are.

183
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:18,400
There just aren't enough drinks that build up a nice head of black foam!

184
00:11:21,087 --> 00:11:22,642
Morning.

185
00:11:22,642 --> 00:11:25,385
Well you were home late last night.

186
00:11:25,385 --> 00:11:27,696
I had dinner with a new friend. Bob.

187
00:11:27,696 --> 00:11:30,048
Oh that's right. Have a good time?

188
00:11:30,048 --> 00:11:34,375
Hardly. The man talks endlessly on subjects that are of no interest to anyone but him.

189
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:39,484
Gee. I can't imagine what that's like.

190
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:43,956
Oh Dad. He took me to this God-awful barbecue place.

191
00:11:43,956 --> 00:11:48,028
All they serve is huge platters of charred greasy beef.

192
00:11:48,028 --> 00:11:56,237
The only sound you can hear is the gnawing of meat, the smacking of lips and the clatter of bones hitting the floor.

193
00:11:56,237 --> 00:11:59,892
I can't take it any more. I'm having that fritter!

194
00:12:01,849 --> 00:12:04,618
If you don't like this man why did you have dinner with him?

195
00:12:04,618 --> 00:12:07,457
Well I was going to tell him that I didn't want to see him anymore but

196
00:12:07,457 --> 00:12:11,794
you see it's a bit more delicate than just that.

197
00:12:11,794 --> 00:12:15,862
The problem is he's in a wheel chair.

198
00:12:15,862 --> 00:12:19,029
So what? If you don't like him you don't like him.

199
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:23,885
Well I know that. It's just that I'd hate to have him think it was just because of the chair.

200
00:12:23,885 --> 00:12:26,921
I have worked with the disabled for over 10 years now.

201
00:12:26,921 --> 00:12:31,748
And if it's one thing I've learned they don't want special treatment.

202
00:12:31,748 --> 00:12:33,766
Oh I forgot to bring in the paper.

203
00:12:33,766 --> 00:12:39,014
Daphne would you get it? My leg's just aching and throbbing!

204
00:12:40,807 --> 00:12:42,988
I'll get it.

205
00:12:42,988 --> 00:12:45,690
You know, Daphne, you're right?

206
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:47,881
I was kind of a coward wasn't I?

207
00:12:47,881 --> 00:12:51,346
Well, at least I got through the evening.

208
00:12:51,346 --> 00:12:54,034
Here's your paper Buddy!

209
00:12:57,451 --> 00:13:00,584
Bob you're here. Did we have plans?

210
00:13:00,584 --> 00:13:03,840
No. I was in the neighbourhood. Just thought I'd stop by.

211
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:09,942
Did I mention where I lived? I'm astonishingly sure I didn't.

212
00:13:09,942 --> 00:13:13,205
You'd be amazed what you can find out with computers today.

213
00:13:13,205 --> 00:13:19,412
Anyway ?brought bagels, poppy seeds, pumpernickel, rye, sesame, onion, garlic.

214
00:13:19,412 --> 00:13:23,523
'Cos after all breakfast is the most important meal of the day.

215
00:13:23,523 --> 00:13:25,382
Hey-ho you must be Martin.

216
00:13:25,382 --> 00:13:27,222
You're Daphne.
That's right.

217
00:13:27,222 --> 00:13:28,496
And you must be Bob.

218
00:13:28,496 --> 00:13:34,221
That's me. Bob! Same forwards as backwards.

219
00:13:37,212 --> 00:13:40,145
THE SQUEAKY WHEEL GIVES THE GRIEF

220
00:13:40,145 --> 00:13:42,102
Got some messages.

221
00:13:42,102 --> 00:13:43,852
Bob. Bob.

222
00:13:43,852 --> 00:13:48,751
And…oh look…here's one from Bob.

223
00:13:48,751 --> 00:13:52,543
2 weeks and 45 phone calls.

224
00:13:52,543 --> 00:13:54,906
Can't we just get an unlisted number?

225
00:13:54,906 --> 00:13:58,132
They sort of frown on that with call-in shows.

226
00:13:58,132 --> 00:14:00,912
Frasier you've got to do something about Bob.

227
00:14:00,912 --> 00:14:04,501
I know Roz. I'm working up to it.

228
00:14:04,501 --> 00:14:07,470
You know the longer you put it off the worse he's going to feel when you finally tell him.

229
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:10,338
Yes I know that. I'm a psychiatrist.

230
00:14:10,338 --> 00:14:15,261
I'm quite capable of dealing with difficult problems in a sensitive mature fashion?

231
00:14:15,261 --> 00:14:17,580
…Wait!

232
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,650
Did you hear that?

233
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,053
That squeak!

234
00:14:21,053 --> 00:14:22,481
What squeak?

235
00:14:22,481 --> 00:14:25,677
He's here. It's Bob!

236
00:14:25,677 --> 00:14:26,806
I don't hear anything.

237
00:14:26,806 --> 00:14:31,664
Oh that's right. Only dogs and I can hear it.

238
00:14:31,664 --> 00:14:35,048
Frasier, you're being paranoid.

239
00:14:35,048 --> 00:14:39,076
It's the sound of his chair. I'd know it anywhere.

240
00:14:40,217 --> 00:14:42,524
Oh..my god!

241
00:14:48,198 --> 00:14:49,182
Hi Bob.

242
00:14:49,182 --> 00:14:51,279
Knock Knock Roz. Frasier around?

243
00:14:51,214 --> 00:14:52,306
You just missed him.

244
00:14:52,306 --> 00:14:53,700
Too bad. I got great news.

245
00:14:53,700 --> 00:15:02,677
I checked out that vacancy in his apartment building and guess who's gonna be neighbours?

246
00:15:02,677 --> 00:15:03,706
What was that?

247
00:15:03,706 --> 00:15:09,131
Feedback. This equipment's old and pathetic!

248
00:15:09,131 --> 00:15:14,873
Well maybe I can catch Frasier back at his place…correction, our place.

249
00:15:14,873 --> 00:15:18,336
Bye Bob.
Bye Roz.

250
00:15:21,685 --> 00:15:23,794
OK he's gone. You can come out now.

251
00:15:23,794 --> 00:15:27,987
No he's not. He's never really gone!

252
00:15:27,987 --> 00:15:29,936
So Bob's gonna be your new neighbour?

253
00:15:29,936 --> 00:15:34,274
Well, break out the butane there every Barbecue day!

254
00:15:34,274 --> 00:15:37,816
NO! NO! He's not going to move into my building.

255
00:15:37,816 --> 00:15:39,744
I won't allow it. I'm going to talk to him Roz.

256
00:15:39,744 --> 00:15:42,184
Listen, I could use your advice. You've broken up with a lot of people.

257
00:15:42,184 --> 00:15:44,495
What do you find to be the most effective thing to say?

258
00:15:44,495 --> 00:15:48,780
I love you and I want to have your baby.

259
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:51,518
Good, I've got my fallback.

260
00:15:54,724 --> 00:15:56,569
Ooh Niles, Niles. I need to talk.

261
00:15:56,569 --> 00:15:58,180
Bob's meeting me here?

262
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,487
This isn't my usual.

263
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:03,196
Well it's not for you. It's for my friend.

264
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:06,042
That man is your friend?

265
00:16:06,042 --> 00:16:10,597
Yep. We share thoughts, feelings. We talk about the arts, current events.

266
00:16:10,597 --> 00:16:13,549
Today we're just…hangin'!

267
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,723
There you are.
Thanks.

268
00:16:18,723 --> 00:16:20,354
My pleasure.

269
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:22,941
You know, I can't stay long.

270
00:16:22,941 --> 00:16:28,115
I've got 4 more pools to clean today besides yours and I'm gonna to lose sunlight.

271
00:16:28,115 --> 00:16:34,467
You know, Ralph, I was thinking that in many ways my profession is a lot like yours.

272
00:16:34,467 --> 00:16:37,832
I start out skimming the surface of the human psyche.

273
00:16:37,832 --> 00:16:48,060
Then I plunge ever deeper into the murky undercurrents, adding chemicals when necessary.

274
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:51,424
…There's a lot of leaves this year!

275
00:16:53,478 --> 00:16:56,862
I'm glad you called. I was starting to get self-conscious here.

276
00:16:56,862 --> 00:17:03,095
It seems like I'm always the one calling or stopping by or suggesting dinner or movies or shopping for hats.

277
00:17:03,095 --> 00:17:07,802
Oh I got you a beaut!

278
00:17:08,473 --> 00:17:10,569
Bob. You really shouldn't have.

279
00:17:10,569 --> 00:17:13,993
I knew you'd like it, neighbour.

280
00:17:13,993 --> 00:17:17,226
About that Bob. Have you actually signed a lease yet?

281
00:17:17,226 --> 00:17:19,609
No. Why?

282
00:17:19,609 --> 00:17:21,936
Well, we need to talk.

283
00:17:21,936 --> 00:17:27,201
Whoa. If you were a woman I'd swear you were dumping me.

284
00:17:28,111 --> 00:17:29,300
Blue one's nice.

285
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:33,805
Mmm. I'm just concerned that blue might be a bit overbearing on a couch of that size.

286
00:17:33,805 --> 00:17:38,033
Although it might complement that Killin rug I was telling you about. What do you think?

287
00:17:38,033 --> 00:17:43,039
I live in my van!

288
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:48,222
So you'd probably go for colours that add the illusion of space?

289
00:17:48,222 --> 00:17:50,450
You know, Dr. Crane to be perfectly honest,

290
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:56,944
when you asked if I wanted coffee ?I thought you were gonna bring me one.

291
00:17:56,944 --> 00:18:03,695
Duly noted Ralph. Next week you can go back to drinking from the hose.

292
00:18:04,755 --> 00:18:12,163
You see I just don't think there's a basis between us for a sound friendship.

293
00:18:12,163 --> 00:18:14,342
Neither of us should feel bad about it.

294
00:18:14,342 --> 00:18:17,237
That's easy for you to say. You're not the one being rejected.

295
00:18:17,237 --> 00:18:19,932
No, no. I'm not rejecting you.

296
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:23,177
Truth is you're pleasant. You're charming.

297
00:18:23,177 --> 00:18:24,931
Frasier, I'm an adult here.

298
00:18:24,931 --> 00:18:29,101
At least respect me enough to tell me what it is you don't like about me.

299
00:18:29,101 --> 00:18:30,787
Well all right, all right.

300
00:18:30,787 --> 00:18:32,465
We have absolutely nothing in common.

301
00:18:32,465 --> 00:18:36,561
You talk on endlessly about subjects that I have no interest in.

302
00:18:36,561 --> 00:18:41,394
You call me all the time. Frankly you're suffocating me!

303
00:18:41,394 --> 00:18:46,922
Wow. I don't know what to say.

304
00:18:46,922 --> 00:18:49,024
I wish you'd said something sooner.

305
00:18:49,024 --> 00:18:56,274
I wanted to. Frankly I was afraid you'd think it was because of the…you know?

306
00:18:56,274 --> 00:18:58,305
The what?

307
00:18:58,305 --> 00:19:00,697
The wheelchair.

308
00:19:00,697 --> 00:19:02,034
Why would I think that?

309
00:19:02,034 --> 00:19:05,918
I don't know. I just wanted you to know that.

310
00:19:05,918 --> 00:19:08,254
I wish it did have to do with the chair.

311
00:19:08,254 --> 00:19:09,505
I beg your pardon.

312
00:19:09,505 --> 00:19:14,456
Well, if the chair were your problem that would make you a jerk.

313
00:19:14,456 --> 00:19:15,764
This way, I'm the jerk.

314
00:19:15,764 --> 00:19:17,524
Well, I wouldn't say that.

315
00:19:17,524 --> 00:19:21,123
Come on, you just did. You just said I'm boring and obnoxious.

316
00:19:21,123 --> 00:19:24,983
Who knows people better than you?

317
00:19:24,983 --> 00:19:28,590
You can keep the hat.

318
00:19:29,808 --> 00:19:34,076
Bob, wait,

319
00:19:34,076 --> 00:19:38,742
please. I've got to level with you.

320
00:19:38,742 --> 00:19:44,334
Truth is I find nothing wrong with you.

321
00:19:44,334 --> 00:19:48,218
I was just ashamed to admit it.

322
00:19:48,218 --> 00:19:50,817
It is the chair.

323
00:19:50,817 --> 00:19:52,644
What?

324
00:19:52,644 --> 00:19:55,953
I think frankly that you are wonderful company.

325
00:19:55,953 --> 00:20:00,052
Wildly stimulating. Your hobbies are so fascinating.

326
00:20:00,052 --> 00:20:05,967
You have a sense of style that really, I mean, doesn't compare to anyone's.

327
00:20:05,967 --> 00:20:11,778
It's just me. I feel petty and small about it but

328
00:20:11,778 --> 00:20:15,724
I can't get past the chair. I'm sorry Bob. Please.

329
00:20:15,724 --> 00:20:17,723
I'm sorry. This is goodbye.

330
00:20:17,723 --> 00:20:19,515
I don't believe this.

331
00:20:19,515 --> 00:20:21,981
You don't want to be my friend 'cos I'm in a wheelchair.

332
00:20:21,981 --> 00:20:24,028
What?

333
00:20:24,028 --> 00:20:26,578
That's the worst thing I've ever heard!

334
00:20:26,578 --> 00:20:28,241
Look. You don't understand.

335
00:20:28,241 --> 00:20:32,739
What's not to understand. You just said flat out ?my chair repulses you

336
00:20:32,739 --> 00:20:34,536
What kind of a person does that?

337
00:20:34,536 --> 00:20:39,319
I've got a birthmark on my back. I guess we can't be friends either!

338
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:42,247
People please. Frankly this doesn't concern any of you.

339
00:20:42,247 --> 00:20:45,157
When I think about all the gifts I gave you.

340
00:20:45,157 --> 00:20:51,562
All the barbecue sauce ?Hot 'n' Spicy, Tex Mex, Mesquite, Teriyaki, Honey Mustard?

341
00:20:51,562 --> 00:20:56,004
Oh For God's sake Bob ?put a sock in it.

342
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:58,677
We were just on our way to dinner. Would you like to join us?

343
00:20:58,677 --> 00:21:01,008
I'd love to.

344
00:21:02,504 --> 00:21:04,713
So. You guys like barbecue?

345
00:21:04,713 --> 00:21:07,273
Yeah. Who doesn't?

346
00:21:36,819 --> 00:21:40,765
Are these wing tips too busy with these pants?

347
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:45,460
Well, yes. They're a bit frenzied. Perhaps a woven lace would tone down the glitz.

348
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:46,968
Might have to go overseas for that.

349
00:21:46,968 --> 00:21:48,727
No, not at all. You can get them downtown.

350
00:21:48,727 --> 00:21:50,047
Well, who shops downtown anymore?

351
00:21:50,047 --> 00:21:51,274
Well I do for one?
