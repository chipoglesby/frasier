1
00:00:09,951 --> 00:00:11,088
Are your eyes closed?

2
00:00:11,088 --> 00:00:12,738
What is it?

3
00:00:12,738 --> 00:00:16,654
It's something my antiques scout found for me.

4
00:00:16,654 --> 00:00:19,192
Voila! Paris, 1882!

5
00:00:19,192 --> 00:00:22,615
Designed by Jean-Francois Blon,
while attending L'Ecole des Beaux Arts!

6
00:00:22,615 --> 00:00:30,003
Mon Dieu! It's absolutely breathtaking!

7
00:00:30,003 --> 00:00:35,278
I'm breathless!

8
00:00:35,278 --> 00:00:39,319
I need to take a breath.

9
00:00:39,319 --> 00:00:42,495
Evening, Dr. Crane.

10
00:00:42,495 --> 00:00:43,693
Would you like to try a game, Niles?

11
00:00:43,693 --> 00:00:46,231
Oh, I think not.  It'll make me too melancholy.

12
00:00:46,231 --> 00:00:46,919
Well, all right.

13
00:00:46,919 --> 00:00:50,039
Maris and I used to play chess
every Thursday night.

14
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:51,637
Oh, how she loved the game.

15
00:00:51,637 --> 00:00:57,981
No wonder ?the king is stationary
while the queen has all the power.

16
00:00:57,981 --> 00:00:59,728
How are you getting along, Dr. Crane?

17
00:00:59,728 --> 00:01:01,398
Oh, all right, I guess.

18
00:01:01,398 --> 00:01:03,212
Feeling a bit lonely, are we?

19
00:01:03,212 --> 00:01:09,869
Only some times when I'm by myself,
or other times when I'm with other people.

20
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:12,900
It may not be my place to suggest this,
but perhaps all you need is

21
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:17,054
a little company at the apartment
something warm and friendly to come home?

22
00:01:17,054 --> 00:01:18,813
Well, I'm sure Dad would miss you.

23
00:01:18,813 --> 00:01:22,470
Oh, Dr. Crane!

24
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:26,685
Oh, me!

25
00:01:26,685 --> 00:01:28,767
I'm talking about a dog.

26
00:01:28,767 --> 00:01:30,107
They're wonderful companions.

27
00:01:30,107 --> 00:01:34,516
Just look at how much Eddie's brought
to your father's life.

28
00:01:34,516 --> 00:01:36,789
Oh, there's nothing like a dog's
unconditional love.

29
00:01:36,789 --> 00:01:39,661
Seeing  that smiling face greet you at the door.

30
00:01:39,661 --> 00:01:44,213
It's one of the most rewarding
relationships a person can have.

31
00:01:44,213 --> 00:01:51,491
Again?  If you're going to drink
out of the toilet, you can at least learn to use it.

32
00:01:51,491 --> 00:01:53,053
Would you like to come with me?

33
00:01:53,053 --> 00:01:56,356
Maybe get the feel of the leash?

34
00:01:56,356 --> 00:01:59,837
Perhaps I will.

35
00:01:59,837 --> 00:02:04,357
You know, Daphne, maybe you're on
to something with this dogbusiness.

36
00:02:04,357 --> 00:02:09,906
I'm starting to feel less lonely already.

37
00:02:12,061 --> 00:02:18,181
Chop, chop!  Come with us.

38
00:02:18,181 --> 00:02:20,165
Oh, hi, Dad.  Did you see my new chess set?

39
00:02:20,165 --> 00:02:21,492
Oh yeah, it's nice.

40
00:02:21,492 --> 00:02:24,020
"Nice?"  Well, the inlay was made
from the same Travertine marble

41
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:26,501
they used at the Emperor Hadrian's
palace outside Tivoli!

44
00:02:36,868 --> 00:02:40,058
Good one, Dad.  Say, how about a game?

45
00:02:40,058 --> 00:02:41,301
Nah, I don't think so.

46
00:02:41,301 --> 00:02:43,469
Oh, come on, Dad.  You know how to play, don't you?

47
00:02:43,469 --> 00:02:46,987
Well, Daphne showed me once.
But really, checkers is more my speed.

48
00:02:46,987 --> 00:02:48,734
Oh, come on, checkers is a kid's game.

49
00:02:48,734 --> 00:02:49,556
Come on, Dad!

50
00:02:49,556 --> 00:02:53,449
I just got it!  Please?  Nobody will play with me!

51
00:02:53,449 --> 00:02:55,837
All right, I'll give it another shot.

52
00:02:55,837 --> 00:02:59,524
Those guys at the park  make it
look great eating baloney sandwiches,

53
00:02:59,524 --> 00:03:03,848
smoking cigars, sometimes a fist-fight
even breaks out!

54
00:03:03,848 --> 00:03:13,088
Well, let's just start with name-calling
and see where it goes, all right?

55
00:03:13,088 --> 00:03:15,028
Your turn.

56
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:18,060
Now, Dad, please, you don't have to rush.

57
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:22,105
As a novice, you have the right to
sit back, survey the board, take yourtime.

58
00:03:22,105 --> 00:03:25,586
I will not pressure you or hover like a vulture.

59
00:03:25,586 --> 00:03:28,314
Please, feel free to ask any questions you might have.

60
00:03:28,314 --> 00:03:35,450
Is this a checkmate?

61
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:38,930
Yes, it is.

62
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:40,313
You mean I won?

63
00:03:40,313 --> 00:03:42,162
Well, yes.

64
00:03:42,162 --> 00:03:44,731
Hey, hey!  I won!  How do you like that?

65
00:03:44,731 --> 00:03:46,656
Well, in all fairness, my mind was
a bit distracted by

66
00:03:46,656 --> 00:03:53,057
having to monitor your side of the
board, but, uh... Touche!

67
00:03:53,057 --> 00:03:54,033
How about another game, Dad?

68
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:56,273
No, I think one'll do it for me, thanks.

69
00:03:56,273 --> 00:03:58,539
Well, uh, all right, fair enough.

70
00:03:58,539 --> 00:04:02,347
Boy, I really clobbered you though, didn't I?

71
00:04:02,347 --> 00:04:04,811
I got almost all of your prawns.

72
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:07,487
Pawns, Dad.

73
00:04:07,487 --> 00:04:09,776
I think the turning point was when
I got that tower-thingy.

74
00:04:09,776 --> 00:04:11,546
Yes, it's called a rook.

75
00:04:11,546 --> 00:04:14,800
But the real knockout blow was when
I backed your little horsey-guy into the corner.

76
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,170
Can we call it a night, Dad?

77
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:17,395
O.K., when I cornered your knight.

78
00:04:17,395 --> 00:04:20,409
No, I mean can we call it a night?

79
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,170
Hey, Frasier.

80
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:30,304
Oh hi, Roz.

81
00:04:30,304 --> 00:04:34,985
Uh, one double-tall latte, a slice
of pecan pie with extra whipped cream.

82
00:04:34,985 --> 00:04:35,713
Anything else?

83
00:04:35,713 --> 00:04:39,065
Perhaps a blood-pressure cuff?

84
00:04:39,065 --> 00:04:40,737
I'm just a little nervous today, O.K.?

85
00:04:40,737 --> 00:04:42,703
Oh, really?  Trouble on the dating front?

86
00:04:42,703 --> 00:04:44,520
I'm not that shallow, all right?

87
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:48,920
It's about my hair.

88
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,794
I've got an appointment this afternoon with Noge.

89
00:04:51,794 --> 00:04:52,963
"Noge?"

90
00:04:52,963 --> 00:04:56,024
He's the hottest hairstylist in Seattle?

91
00:04:56,024 --> 00:04:57,537
"Noge?"

92
00:04:57,537 --> 00:04:59,354
I think he's getting a little bored with me.

93
00:04:59,354 --> 00:05:03,120
When he cuts my hair, I can't ever
think of anything to say!

94
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,305
Well, how's this for an icebreaker:

95
00:05:04,305 --> 00:05:09,543
"Say, Noge, where'd you get such a stupid name?"

96
00:05:09,543 --> 00:05:11,113
You should see him with all of
his other clients.

97
00:05:11,113 --> 00:05:13,094
They're all laughing, having
a wonderful time.

98
00:05:13,094 --> 00:05:15,818
I walk in, sit down, it's death.

99
00:05:15,818 --> 00:05:19,617
Maybe there's something in here
that'll hold his attention.

100
00:05:19,617 --> 00:05:22,263
Oh, wow, here's something.

101
00:05:22,263 --> 00:05:26,417
A lady in Italy gave birth to
a nineteen-pound baby!

102
00:05:26,417 --> 00:05:27,478
Oh my God.

103
00:05:27,478 --> 00:05:28,087
No kidding.

104
00:05:28,087 --> 00:05:32,825
She's not going to be hopping on
her Vespa anytime soon.

105
00:05:32,825 --> 00:05:34,263
That's how he did it.

106
00:05:34,263 --> 00:05:35,561
What are you talking about?

107
00:05:35,561 --> 00:05:39,240
My father beat me at chess last night,
and I've just realized now it was sheer dumb luck.

108
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,845
He stumbled into the Panoph-Vinick attack!

109
00:05:41,845 --> 00:05:42,901
Frasier, I?

110
00:05:42,901 --> 00:05:44,267
Oh Roz, I can't tell you what
a relief this is.

111
00:05:44,267 --> 00:05:47,683
My God, my whole world makes sense again.

112
00:05:47,683 --> 00:05:50,182
Frasier, you are forgetting about
my problem with Noge.

113
00:05:50,182 --> 00:05:54,262
Yes, and it'd be a lot easier
if you'd stop bringing it up.

114
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:02,508
Hello, Niles.

115
00:06:02,508 --> 00:06:03,341
Hello, Frasier.

116
00:06:03,341 --> 00:06:04,598
To what do I owe this pleasure?

117
00:06:04,598 --> 00:06:08,206
Well, I took to heart Daphne's 
suggestion the other day about a need for companionship

118
00:06:08,206 --> 00:06:16,731
since my separation from Maris,
so I went out and got a new lady in my life.

119
00:06:16,731 --> 00:06:17,613
I can't explain it.

120
00:06:17,613 --> 00:06:20,483
I'm not a dog person, but there's
something about this particular breed that

121
00:06:20,483 --> 00:06:27,259
I find comforting and familiar.

122
00:06:27,259 --> 00:06:28,315
It's mystifying, isn't it?

123
00:06:28,315 --> 00:06:31,018
Mmm, baffling.

124
00:06:31,018 --> 00:06:34,068
I-I happened into my local pet shop,
and I had no intention of buying anything,

125
00:06:34,068 --> 00:06:37,534
I was merely browsing, and they showed
me some overly demonstrative puppies.

126
00:06:37,534 --> 00:06:41,061
Then I heard a haughty little sniff
from a cage in the corner,

127
00:06:41,061 --> 00:06:42,532
and there she was!

128
00:06:42,532 --> 00:06:43,933
Sit, Girl, sit!

129
00:06:43,933 --> 00:06:48,925
OK.

130
00:06:48,925 --> 00:06:52,396
She's, uh, she's a bit high strung,
but, uh, she's terribly well-bred.

131
00:06:52,396 --> 00:06:57,186
When I tried to pet her, she'd have none of it.

132
00:06:57,186 --> 00:06:59,578
Well, I'm surprised she wasn't snapped
up before you got there.

133
00:06:59,578 --> 00:07:02,902
Yes, well, the man at the pet store 
said it's because people are reluctant to

134
00:07:02,902 --> 00:07:05,860
take responsibility for her nerve medicine.

135
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:06,436
No, not on the couch.

136
00:07:06,436 --> 00:07:07,733
Off, off!

137
00:07:07,733 --> 00:07:12,301
OK.

138
00:07:12,301 --> 00:07:12,979
Hey, Niles.

139
00:07:12,979 --> 00:07:15,079
Hey, Dad.

140
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:18,863
What the hell is that?

141
00:07:18,863 --> 00:07:21,311
It's my dog, my new best friend.

142
00:07:21,311 --> 00:07:25,219
Yes, Niles saw her in the pet store
and had this inexplicable attraction.

143
00:07:25,219 --> 00:07:26,341
You can see her ribs!

144
00:07:26,341 --> 00:07:28,844
Hit Number One.

145
00:07:28,844 --> 00:07:30,819
Daphne, I owe it all to you.

146
00:07:30,819 --> 00:07:35,363
Oh really, Dr. Crane, I wouldn't
want you going around telling people

147
00:07:35,363 --> 00:07:38,862
I was responsible for that.

148
00:07:38,862 --> 00:07:41,693
Well, I guess we'll be toddling along.

149
00:07:41,693 --> 00:07:43,653
Come Girl, come!

150
00:07:43,653 --> 00:07:48,725
OK.

151
00:07:48,725 --> 00:07:51,807
The city streets play havoc with her
delicate little feet,

152
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:58,693
so I have to go home and pumice her paw-pads!

153
00:07:58,693 --> 00:07:59,946
Am I the only one?

154
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:03,037
No.

155
00:08:03,037 --> 00:08:05,068
Does Dr. Crane have any idea...

156
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:09,590
No.

157
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:14,539
So, Dad, can I, uh, interest you
in an ice-cold Ballantine?

158
00:08:14,539 --> 00:08:15,867
Yeah, sounds good.

159
00:08:15,867 --> 00:08:17,688
You know, I may even join you myself.

160
00:08:17,688 --> 00:08:21,383
I've got some pork rinds here and
some of that creamy Lipton onion soup dip!

161
00:08:21,383 --> 00:08:23,161
Oh, with the seven herbs and spices?

162
00:08:23,161 --> 00:08:25,105
Well, just count 'em!

163
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:27,761
Hey, that's great!

164
00:08:27,761 --> 00:08:35,418
All my favorite stuff... you're putting me
in a home, aren't you?

165
00:08:35,418 --> 00:08:39,182
Oh, don't be silly!

166
00:08:39,182 --> 00:08:41,241
But you know, if I ever had to, don't you think

167
00:08:41,241 --> 00:08:45,623
it'd be nice if you knew how to play chess?

168
00:08:55,863 --> 00:09:00,322
Dad, it's not considered a move until
my fingers have completely cleared the piece.

169
00:09:00,322 --> 00:09:02,120
Well, what's taking so long?

170
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,410
I am analyzing my options.

171
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:04,848
Unlike your "wing-it" approach,

172
00:09:04,848 --> 00:09:13,992
I like to plan a strategy, like a 
general leading his troops into battle.

173
00:09:13,992 --> 00:09:20,733
Checkmate, Schwartzkopf.

174
00:09:20,733 --> 00:09:22,512
Gosh, that's very well done.

175
00:09:22,512 --> 00:09:25,009
You're really getting a feel for the game, Dad.

176
00:09:25,009 --> 00:09:30,446
Yeah, and all this time I thought chess was hard.

177
00:09:30,446 --> 00:09:31,327
Well, see ya.

178
00:09:31,327 --> 00:09:38,527
Sit down, old man, you're not going anywhere!

179
00:09:38,527 --> 00:09:41,439
Mr. Crane, would you give me
a hand with these dishes?

180
00:09:41,439 --> 00:09:52,959
I can't, I'm playing chess with Frasier.

181
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:57,470
Finally, my patience will be rewarded. 
The trap is set.

182
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:59,909
I knew this moment would come!

183
00:09:59,909 --> 00:10:03,385
It comes every game.

184
00:10:03,385 --> 00:10:07,232
Checkmate.

185
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:08,126
Well, that's it.

186
00:10:08,126 --> 00:10:09,180
Show's over, folks.

187
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:09,927
Move along.

188
00:10:09,927 --> 00:10:11,117
Nothing more to see here.

189
00:10:11,117 --> 00:10:11,993
You know, Dad?

190
00:10:11,993 --> 00:10:13,781
No, no, I'm not playing anymore.

191
00:10:13,781 --> 00:10:14,999
I'm tired and I'm going to bed.

192
00:10:14,999 --> 00:10:16,783
O.K.

193
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:21,349
Yes, I guess I've had my fill as well.

194
00:10:21,349 --> 00:10:25,278
Well, this has really turned out to be
quite a good idea, hasn't it, this chess thing?

195
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:26,012
'Night.

196
00:10:26,012 --> 00:10:27,446
Awfully relaxing... oh, yes, yes,

197
00:10:27,446 --> 00:10:28,678
you just - you just go on ahead,

198
00:10:28,678 --> 00:10:33,390
I-I've got - hah! - something I've got to do...

199
00:10:45,957 --> 00:10:46,891
Hey, Frasier!

200
00:10:46,891 --> 00:10:47,939
Hi, Roz.

201
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:49,643
I have great news!

202
00:10:49,643 --> 00:10:52,791
My appointment with Noge could not
have gone better.

203
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:54,871
What is the reason behind this miraculous
transformation?

204
00:10:54,871 --> 00:10:58,237
Well, it occurred to me that hairstylists
love celebrity gossip.

205
00:10:58,237 --> 00:11:03,652
And I thought, "hey, I know a celebrity: you!"

206
00:11:03,652 --> 00:11:05,964
And what did you tell him about me?

207
00:11:05,964 --> 00:11:11,606
Well, he may have gotten the impression that you?

208
00:11:11,606 --> 00:11:14,461
well, you're gonna love this ?that, you know...

209
00:11:14,461 --> 00:11:18,446
you may have been... in the past... a woman,

210
00:11:18,446 --> 00:11:22,398
you're not mad at me, are you?

211
00:11:22,398 --> 00:11:26,724
Mad?  Why should I be mad, knowing 
the sacred code of silence

212
00:11:26,724 --> 00:11:30,059
all hairdressers have sworn to?

213
00:11:30,059 --> 00:11:32,763
All right, I'll set Noge straight.

214
00:11:32,763 --> 00:11:39,531
Well, if you manage that, then you
really would have a story.

215
00:11:39,531 --> 00:11:41,662
Well, hello.

216
00:11:41,662 --> 00:11:42,603
Double cappuccino, please.

217
00:11:42,603 --> 00:11:43,726
Yeah, same for me, please.

218
00:11:43,726 --> 00:11:46,084
Listen, Niles, I need to talk to you about Dad.

219
00:11:46,084 --> 00:11:50,596
Oh yes, how is the Bobby Fischer of
the geriatric circuit?

220
00:11:50,596 --> 00:11:51,589
Well, he's still beating me.

221
00:11:51,589 --> 00:11:56,363
I tell you, Niles, I just can't figure
it out ?I am the superior player.

222
00:11:56,363 --> 00:12:00,721
There's a saying: "In every boy's life,
the moment of greatest joy and

223
00:12:00,721 --> 00:12:04,276
greatest sorrow is when he defeats
his father for the first time."

224
00:12:04,276 --> 00:12:06,253
If you're suggesting that I'm afraid to beat Dad,

225
00:12:06,253 --> 00:12:07,899
you can just stop right there.

226
00:12:07,899 --> 00:12:09,868
O.K.  The other option is,
he's better than you.

227
00:12:09,868 --> 00:12:14,114
You were saying?

228
00:12:14,114 --> 00:12:16,283
Sooner or later, the son eclipses the father.

229
00:12:16,283 --> 00:12:17,530
It's the natural order.

230
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:21,277
Yet it's frequently a stumbling
block because the son's competitive stirrings are

231
00:12:21,277 --> 00:12:24,579
accompanied by tremendous feelings of guilt.

232
00:12:24,579 --> 00:12:29,377
I see.  Yes, it's the classic Oedipal conflict.

233
00:12:29,377 --> 00:12:30,753
It seems so obvious now.

234
00:12:30,753 --> 00:12:32,696
I've been letting him win!

235
00:12:32,696 --> 00:12:34,287
Niles, thank you,thank you very much.

236
00:12:34,287 --> 00:12:35,616
I can't tell you what a relief this is.

237
00:12:35,616 --> 00:12:37,694
I feel like a weight has been lifted.

238
00:12:37,694 --> 00:12:38,998
Nothing can hold me back now.

239
00:12:38,998 --> 00:12:41,694
Tonight, I topple the king!

240
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:43,350
Hear, hear.

241
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:44,597
Of course, you realize by dethroning Dad,

242
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:47,368
you're next in line to be dethroned
by Frederick, and then the only thing left

243
00:12:47,368 --> 00:12:53,266
after that is death, but that's another
day and another cup of coffee.

244
00:13:02,767 --> 00:13:07,447
Dad?  Dad, wake up, it's your turn.

245
00:13:07,447 --> 00:13:16,32
