00:00:12,352 --> 00:00:14,395
You'll ruin his concentration!

3
00:00:14,567 --> 00:00:19,535
He's on a stakeout to catch 
whoever's been pinching our newspaper. 
He's been at it for over an hour!

4
00:00:19,707 --> 00:00:23,759
I must say, I can see why he was 
such a good policeman.

5
00:00:25,933 --> 00:00:27,977
Yes, very impressive, isn't he?

6
00:00:28,148 --> 00:00:30,525
When he wakes up you must get him 
to tell you about his stint

7
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:34,037
as security coordinator for Jimmy Hoffa! 

8
00:00:36,088 --> 00:00:38,667
Dad, come on, rise and shine.

9
00:00:38,846 --> 00:00:40,890
You fell asleep.

10
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:47,204
Ah yes, I see our newspaper thief 
has struck again!

11
00:00:47,371 --> 00:00:50,212
- Damn, he's good!
- Come on in.

12
00:00:51,717 --> 00:00:55,592
This morning, for the first time 
since our separation,

13
00:00:55,771 --> 00:00:58,017
Maris actually picked up the phone 
and called me!
She needs a favour.

14
00:00:58,195 --> 00:01:02,331
Well Niles, I think that's hardly 
cause to celebrate.  She called you 
just because she wants something?

15
00:01:02,499 --> 00:01:04,412
No, no, not "wants," Frasier. "Needs."

16
00:01:04,588 --> 00:01:09,140
This is my chance to show her 
how necessary I really am to her, 
and all I have to do 
is fix one small problem!

17
00:01:09,311 --> 00:01:12,520
- What's the problem?
- Uh, she's wanted by the police.

18
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,827
Apparently, she was driving 
past a shoe store last week,

19
00:01:19,006 --> 00:01:21,763
when she spotted a stunning pair 
of Ferragamo pumps.

20
00:01:21,931 --> 00:01:26,436
Well, I need not remind you what effect 
a Ferragamo sighting can have 
on Maris's hand-eye coordination.

21
00:01:27,865 --> 00:01:30,158
She drove up on the sidewalk,

22
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:35,298
and when the police ran her name 
through the computer, they found 
quite a little backlog of unpaid 
parking tickets!

23
00:01:35,471 --> 00:01:41,853
What else would you expect from a woman 
who thinks her chocolate allergy 
entitles her to park in a handicapped space?

24
00:01:42,031 --> 00:01:46,833
Oh, and to top it all off 
she neglected to appear for her summons, 
and so they immediately swore out a warrant,

25
00:01:47,004 --> 00:01:49,131
and that brings us to you, Dad.

26
00:01:49,303 --> 00:01:51,133
Why?

27
00:01:51,309 --> 00:01:54,731
You were a cop.  
I'm sure you still have "chums," hint-hint?

28
00:01:55,947 --> 00:01:59,073
Who could lend you a hand, wink-wink?

29
00:01:59,249 --> 00:02:02,208
No.  Look, you know I'd do anything for you, 
but not this.

30
00:02:02,383 --> 00:02:05,723
All my years on the force 
I never even fixed a ticket, 
let alone an arrest warrant.

31
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:11,901
- You couldn't pull one little string?
- No, I hope everything works out for you, 
but I think the law should be the same 
for everyone.

32
00:02:12,078 --> 00:02:15,667
Well, it's not.  We'd all like to believe 
that justice is blind,
but the sad truth is,

33
00:02:15,839 --> 00:02:19,214
wealthy white women 
just can't get a fair shake!

34
00:02:19,976 --> 00:02:22,733
The courts love to make examples 
of them.

35
00:02:22,901 --> 00:02:26,359
Oh, they do.  
Just think of Zsa Zsa Gabor, 
or Leona Helmsley.

36
00:02:26,537 --> 00:02:31,255
Oh yes, two perfectly lovely women 
victimized by an unjust system.

37
00:02:32,847 --> 00:02:38,731
Alright, fine. If you won't help me, 
I'll just have to help myself. 
I'm going down to that precinct house, 
and I'm not leaving until I get justice.

38
00:02:38,906 --> 00:02:43,411
Well, not exactly justice, I suppose, 
more like preferential treatment, 
but I'm not leaving 'til I get it! 

39
00:02:45,342 --> 00:02:50,060
What a horrible thing to happen.  
Can you picture poor Mrs. Crane 
confined to a jail cell?

40
00:02:50,231 --> 00:02:52,774
Only if they moved the bars 
closer together.

41
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,164
THE LITTLE COMMODORE

44
00:03:08,827 --> 00:03:10,871
Well, right back atcha!

45
00:03:12,129 --> 00:03:16,265
- I take it things didn't go down 
so well at the station?
- The police simply would not 
listen to reason.

46
00:03:16,433 --> 00:03:20,355
- Police?
- They're persecuting my Maris 
over some silly parking fines.

47
00:03:20,528 --> 00:03:25,413
I felt sure they'd ease up 
if they understood Maris a little better, 
so I tried to explain her to them.

48
00:03:25,585 --> 00:03:27,628
Oh, dear God.

49
00:03:28,635 --> 00:03:30,882
You know, I dated a guy once 
who got in trouble with the cops...

50
00:03:31,059 --> 00:03:35,112
Notice the complete absence of gasps 
following that statement.

51
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:42,127
Oh!  OK fine, you little weasel.  
Just forget it. 
I was going to help you, 
but Maris can just rot in the slammer.

52
00:03:44,264 --> 00:03:47,556
Ooh Roz, I was joshing!  
I know how you enjoy our little by-play!

53
00:03:47,733 --> 00:03:50,110
That weasel line, ouch, touché!

54
00:03:52,246 --> 00:03:57,214
- You know what, you're even more annoying 
when you grovel.
- Zing!  Got me again!

55
00:03:57,386 --> 00:04:00,477
Roz, if not for his sake, 
then for mine, please?

56
00:04:00,646 --> 00:04:05,781
OK, for you.  My friend Phil 
had some major traffic violations,

57
00:04:05,953 --> 00:04:10,790
and he was so freaked 
that he called this guy who, 
you know, fixes things.

58
00:04:10,968 --> 00:04:15,603
Sounds just a tad shady, Roz.  
You mean he went to some hoodlum?

59
00:04:15,773 --> 00:04:19,861
Well, I wouldn't use the word 
"hoodlum" in front of him.

60
00:04:20,036 --> 00:04:24,505
Just think of him as a guy 
who makes wishes come true.

61
00:04:25,594 --> 00:04:30,978
Like a fairy godfather.  
Another word I wouldn't use 
in front of him.

62
00:04:31,152 --> 00:04:33,279
Here we go!  
Jerome Belasco.

63
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:36,077
Oh Roz, you are an angel of mercy.  
How can I repay you?

64
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:42,097
The next time you think of some witty 
little thing to say about my sex life, 
or what I'm wearing, 
just keep it to yourself.

65
00:04:43,438 --> 00:04:45,731
Consider it done.

66
00:04:45,903 --> 00:04:48,530
- Give me that!
- No, give me that!

67
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:55,097
Are you mad?  I will not have you 
turning a minor, albeit annoying 
situation into a, a Martin Scorsese film!

68
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,862
You don't understand what this means to me.  
When Maris asked me for this favour, 
do you know what she said?

69
00:05:01,031 --> 00:05:04,073
She said, 
"Niles, will you be my Commodore?"

70
00:05:04,249 --> 00:05:08,254
- Her Commodore?
- That's what she used to call her father.

71
00:05:08,428 --> 00:05:13,348
- Frasier, there was no problem so great 
that that man couldn't fix it.
- I'm sure.

72
00:05:13,526 --> 00:05:17,995
Remember that lovely jeweled crucifix 
Maris picked up on her first 
communion trip to Rome?

73
00:05:18,165 --> 00:05:21,872
Who do you think smoothed things over 
with the Vatican?

74
00:05:23,555 --> 00:05:28,808
Yes, whatever happened to the days 
when a parent would take a wayward child 
by the hand, march them back 
to the scene of the crime...

75
00:05:28,988 --> 00:05:32,030
and make them say, 
"I'm sorry, Your Holiness, 
it'll never happen again"? 

76
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:34,452
You don't understand.

77
00:05:34,629 --> 00:05:39,800
If I show Maris that I can step 
into the Commodore's plimsolls, 
she'll have a whole new respect for me.

78
00:05:39,979 --> 00:05:42,022
We can rebuild our marriage 
on a healthier foundation.  
Frasier, please.

79
00:05:50,091 --> 00:05:53,764
Thank you.  I just know this man 
is the answer to my problems.

80
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:59,653
Yes, who better to mend the fragile fabric 
of a troubled marriage than a man 
whose business address is a wharf!

81
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:04,885
A WORD TO THE WISEGUY

82
00:06:05,052 --> 00:06:11,018
- Niles, look.  This is ridiculous, 
it's past midnight. I'm leaving.
- No, no, no, you can't leave.  
You're my backup.

83
00:06:13,034 --> 00:06:15,826
I wonder what's keeping him?

84
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:26,734
- Do you suppose that's him?
- I doubt it, that overcoat is Armani!

85
00:06:26,908 --> 00:06:32,542
Good point, Niles.  
Where would a criminal come up 
with the money for something like that?

86
00:06:35,433 --> 00:06:41,149
- Oh, Dr. Crane, I presume?
- Oh, yes.  I'm Niles Crane, 
this is my brother, Dr. Frasier Crane.

87
00:06:41,325 --> 00:06:43,785
- Jerome Belasco.
- Pleasure.

88
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:50,222
Excuse my tardiness, 
but my lady friend and I were having one of 
those discussions from which it is difficult 
to remove oneself.

89
00:06:50,393 --> 00:06:55,563
- Yes, we certainly know about those, 
don't we?
- Yes, dames!

90
00:06:56,787 --> 00:06:59,579
So you have some problem you think 
I can help you with?

91
00:06:59,754 --> 00:07:01,797
Well, I do.  Please, Jerome.

92
00:07:04,476 --> 00:07:09,480
Well, you see, last week my lady 
got on the wrong side of "Larry Law,"

93
00:07:09,658 --> 00:07:14,079
and since then certain, shall we say, 
"complications" have arisen,

94
00:07:14,255 --> 00:07:19,556
and in brief, 
things have got "hot-hot-hot," 
and we believe you are the man 
to "turn on the air conditionin'."

95
00:07:22,654 --> 00:07:26,112
I sense you're a film buff, Dr. Crane.

96
00:07:27,209 --> 00:07:30,132
- Just show him the charges, Niles.
- Yes, here we are.

97
00:07:30,302 --> 00:07:32,345
 Quite a few.

98
00:07:32,517 --> 00:07:35,476
"Ignoring a summons, speeding, 
reckless endangerment."

99
00:07:35,651 --> 00:07:40,618
- Your wife sounds like 
a very carefree lady..
- Oh, yes.  She's ounces of fun.

100
00:07:44,092 --> 00:07:47,468
Do you think you could persuade 
the police to show some leniency?

101
00:07:47,644 --> 00:07:50,984
Well, there's never any harm 
in making a phone call.  
Excuse me.

102
00:07:51,154 --> 00:07:53,781
Thank you!  
Yes, around and straight to the back.

103
00:07:55,835 --> 00:08:00,589
He's making the call!  
He's making the call!
Frasier, you're going to think 
I'm mad for saying this,

104
00:08:00,766 --> 00:08:02,809
but... that was fun!

105
00:08:04,443 --> 00:08:06,071
Well, I must admit, Niles,

106
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:12,754
it is not entirely unpleasant 
to rub shoulders with the demi-monde.

107
00:08:12,927 --> 00:08:15,969
I definitely felt a real 
testosterone surge, you know?

108
00:08:16,144 --> 00:08:20,696
Me too, me too!  
It's like an actual tingling in my chest. 
And now it's gone...

109
00:08:22,204 --> 00:08:24,247
there it is again!

110
00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:26,462
...and now it's gone.

111
00:08:26,633 --> 00:08:29,260
Oh, Niles, it must be 
your cellular phone vibrating.

112
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:32,521
Oh, it is!  You're right.

113
00:08:38,627 --> 00:08:41,753
Hello?  Oh hello, Maris!  
Yes, I'm tending to that 
very matter right now.

114
00:08:41,928 --> 00:08:44,471
Oh, just wait a second.

115
00:08:44,645 --> 00:08:48,270
- Well?
- You may consider the matter 
dealt with.

116
00:08:50,202 --> 00:08:52,877
Maris, it's all taken care of...

117
00:08:53,963 --> 00:08:56,007
What did you say?

118
00:08:56,889 --> 00:09:00,145
No, I've just never heard 
those words before.

119
00:09:01,235 --> 00:09:03,278
You're welcome.

120
00:09:06,835 --> 00:09:09,128
Oh Jerome, thank you!

121
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:13,306
Now, if you'll excuse me gentlemen, 
I've got another business engagement.

122
00:09:13,479 --> 00:09:17,104
At this hour of the night?
My God, it's past midnight. 
What kind of business 
could it possibly be

123
00:09:17,282 --> 00:09:19,742
...of mine where you're going?!

124
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:23,253
- Tell me, what do I owe you?
- Oh, nothing.  

125
00:09:23,425 --> 00:09:26,800
- I was happy I could help.
- Oh, don't be silly.  I insist!

126
00:09:26,977 --> 00:09:30,483
Consider it a favor.
I was in a position to help you.

127
00:09:30,654 --> 00:09:33,447
Perhaps someday you'll be 
in a position to help me.

128
00:09:33,621 --> 00:09:38,708
Oh, I would love that.  
If there's ever anything I can do 
for you, just say the word.

129
00:09:38,887 --> 00:09:42,060
- You're very kind.  
It was a pleasure meeting you both.
- And you.

130
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:45,486
And I meant that!  
Anything at all, you just let me know!

131
00:09:47,662 --> 00:09:49,873
I shouldn't have said that, should I?

132
00:09:52,677 --> 00:09:55,767
DOESN'T EVERYONE HAVE 
POI RAMEKINS?

133
00:10:02,247 --> 00:10:04,290
Jerome!  Look Niles, it's Jerome!

134
00:10:04,462 --> 00:10:06,505
In my house!

135
00:10:08,348 --> 00:10:10,392
We've been having 
the most delightful chat.

136
00:10:10,563 --> 00:10:14,188
Dr. Crane, you're a lucky young man 
to have such a charming young woman 
in your employ.

137
00:10:14,366 --> 00:10:16,695
Oh, go on.

138
00:10:18,043 --> 00:10:22,049
Did you know his brother 
supplied the cement for this very building?

139
00:10:25,482 --> 00:10:31,198
- What a small world, 
oh look at the time!
- So Jerome, you didn't tell us 
what line of work you're in.

140
00:10:31,374 --> 00:10:33,870
Oh wait, let me guess!
I'm a bit psychic.

141
00:10:34,048 --> 00:10:36,544
Let's see...

142
00:10:36,723 --> 00:10:41,310
you're some sort of doctor.  
An osteopath, perhaps?

143
00:10:41,487 --> 00:10:43,530
- No.
- Well that's odd.

144
00:10:43,702 --> 00:10:47,957
I can see you hovering over people 
with broken bones.

145
00:10:50,388 --> 00:10:53,348
Boys, why don't you help me 
get some refreshments 
for your new friend?

146
00:10:59,331 --> 00:11:03,717
- Who the hell is this guy?
- He's some hooligan who helped 
fix Maris's legal problem,

147
00:11:03,886 --> 00:11:07,012
and in return 
I promised him a favour.

148
00:11:07,187 --> 00:11:10,397
Oh God, do you think 
that's why he's here? To collect?

149
00:11:10,572 --> 00:11:14,792
No, Niles.  
He's probably having a luau and 
he came to borrow our Poi Ramekins!

150
00:11:16,631 --> 00:11:19,210
Are you guys nuts?
You don't get involved with somebody 
like that!

151
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:25,154
Wait, before we panic, we should 
at least talk to him.  You know, 
get the "straight dope."  
Also known as "the skinny."

152
00:11:26,243 --> 00:11:28,953
Knock it off, Bugsy!

153
00:11:30,882 --> 00:11:34,340
Stealing newspapers is 
most un-neighborly behavior.

154
00:11:34,517 --> 00:11:38,357
If you would like I could find out 
who's doing it, and make sure they 
never even think...

155
00:11:38,529 --> 00:11:41,025
Oh no!  No!  That's fine!

156
00:11:41,203 --> 00:11:44,995
So Jerome, is there something 
we can do for you?

157
00:11:45,173 --> 00:11:49,261
Since you ask, you may recall 
the other evening I mentioned 
my lady friend?  If I may...

158
00:11:56,582 --> 00:11:58,662
Oh!  She's a pretty thing, 
isn't she!

159
00:11:58,838 --> 00:12:01,964
This is at the dog track 
where we met.

160
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:04,386
And here's our first 
Sinatra concert.

161
00:12:07,322 --> 00:12:11,374
And this was at the funeral 
of a business associate.

162
00:12:12,963 --> 00:12:19,774
You know, for the life of me, 
I can't recall ever having seen a woman 
wearing so many different kinds of furs 
all at the same time.

163
00:12:20,736 --> 00:12:24,872
- Well, Brandy is a uniquely 
stylish woman.
- Brandy?

164
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,963
Yeah, the traditional spelling.

165
00:12:31,392 --> 00:12:36,562
We've been engaged for eight years, 
but she refuses to set a wedding date.

166
00:12:36,741 --> 00:12:43,088
This upsets me.  It also 
upsets my mother, whose comments 
on the subject are frequent and vivid.

167
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,471
So where do these two come in?

168
00:12:45,642 --> 00:12:50,028
Well, if she's reluctant to marry me, 
obviously she needs therapy.

169
00:12:50,197 --> 00:12:53,370
Well, you're in luck!  
Niles happens to be one of the finest 
marriage counselors in all of Seattle!

170
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:56,750
Well actually, Dr. Crane, 
I would prefer it if Brandy spoke 
to you.

171
00:12:56,925 --> 00:13:00,016
- To me?
- No offense to you, Dr. Crane.

172
00:13:00,185 --> 00:13:02,228
Oh, none taken!

173
00:13:07,832 --> 00:13:13,050
She's a great fan of your show.
I'm sure she'd heed any advice 
that you might care to offer.

174
00:13:13,223 --> 00:13:17,443
Such as "Marry him. Promptly."

175
00:13:20,327 --> 00:13:25,045
But I'm not here to put words 
into your mouth.  
You'll know what to say.

176
00:13:29,688 --> 00:13:34,157
Jerome, you know I'm a psychiatrist.
I'm used to rendering my opinion,

177
00:13:34,327 --> 00:13:38,712
not being a mouthpiece for someone else. 
I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this.

178
00:13:42,141 --> 00:13:46,277
Dr. Crane, there are some times 
in life we must do unpleasant things.

179
00:13:46,445 --> 00:13:49,821
I'd hate to tell you some 
of the unpleasant things 
I've had to do.

180
00:13:52,379 --> 00:13:55,339
I see.  Well then,..

181
00:13:55,514 --> 00:13:58,770
why don't you just give Brandy 
my unlisted home number,

182
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:03,362
which I'm sure you came across 
when you were finding out 
where I lived.

183
00:14:05,167 --> 00:14:09,921
- I'll be glad to chat with her.
- Thank you.  She'll be in touch.

184
00:14:10,098 --> 00:14:13,723
And I hope that one day 
you'll dance at my wedding.

185
00:14:15,907 --> 00:14:17,950
If I'm able to dance.

186
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:22,999
If you ask me, you're getting 
off easy.  He could have asked 
you for a much bigger favour.

187
00:14:23,178 --> 00:14:27,398
Dad, how can I possibly as 
a self-respecting psychiatrist 
tell any woman to marry that thug?

188
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:31,488
What are you talking about?  
He seemed very nice to me.

189
00:14:31,661 --> 00:14:35,833
This coming from the psychic 
who thought he was a chiropractor!

190
00:14:36,007 --> 00:14:41,605
Listen, I've heard your show. 
One more piece of half-assed advice 
isn't going to kill you.

191
00:14:44,867 --> 00:14:47,659
- Jerome, on the other hand...
- Okay, dad!

192
00:14:50,132 --> 00:14:55,647
The key to lasting weight-loss 
is to change the way 
you view food everyday.

193
00:14:55,815 --> 00:14:59,357
You can't go on through life 
binging and then starving 
yourself for two weeks 

194
00:14:59,534 --> 00:15:03,076
just to fit into that gorgeous 
new evening gown you've bought 
for a special occasion.

195
00:15:03,254 --> 00:15:07,259
- Can you understand that?
- Yeah.  Thanks Doc.

196
00:15:14,161 --> 00:15:17,501
Don't mention it, Steve.  
Roz, who's our next caller?

197
00:15:17,671 --> 00:15:20,678
We have Randy, from Richmond Beach.

198
00:15:20,847 --> 00:15:24,769
- Hello Randy, I'm listening.
- Not Randy, Brandy.

199
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:30,705
The traditional spelling.

200
00:15:31,921 --> 00:15:35,379
You know we're all out of time, 
my goodness I feel so sorry but...

201
00:15:35,557 --> 00:15:39,894
- No, you're not.  
We've got five minutes left!
- Thank you, Roz!

202
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:43,570
Alright Brandy, go ahead.  
Your problem, please.

203
00:15:43,747 --> 00:15:46,754
It's my boyfriend, Jerome.
He said I should call you.

204
00:15:46,923 --> 00:15:51,975
We've been semi-engaged 
for eight years, and he wants 
to get married.

205
00:15:53,693 --> 00:15:58,031
Well, I can certainly hear the love 
in your voice, so I say case closed, 
best of luck to you in the future!

206
00:15:58,206 --> 00:16:00,619
Whoa!  You got a bus to catch?! 

207
00:16:00,797 --> 00:16:04,589
There's a lot more to it.
For starters I think he's cheated on me.

208
00:16:04,767 --> 00:16:09,652
Well, in my experience, 
if you suspect something like that, 
nine out of ten times you're right.

209
00:16:11,788 --> 00:16:16,340
Well, I think a little mistrust 
adds mystery to a relationship.

210
00:16:21,901 --> 00:16:25,359
Mystery I could stand 
if he didn't neglect me so much.

211
00:16:25,536 --> 00:16:29,624
Every time we go for a romantic 
dinner, he gets a phone call

212
00:16:29,883 --> 00:16:33,638
and bang, it's "Gotta work babe, 
finish your lobster.  
I'll send you a limo."

213
00:16:33,811 --> 00:16:39,278
Lobster?  Limos?  My God, give me 
his number and I'll marry him!

214
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:46,717
Money ain't everything, especially 
when you've got a sex life like ours...

215
00:16:46,891 --> 00:16:50,516
- He's not even good in bed?
- Who knows?  We're never there 
long enough to find out!

216
00:16:50,693 --> 00:16:52,571
You know, this really isn't necessary...

217
00:16:52,741 --> 00:16:58,042
I said to him last night, 
"What the hell was that?!  
I've been vaccinated slower!"

218
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:11,578
Well, that just leaves more time 
to cuddle!

219
00:17:11,755 --> 00:17:13,799
- Can I say something?
- No!

220
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:18,855
Look, I could deal with the other 
problems, if it weren't 
for one thing.

221
00:17:19,026 --> 00:17:24,542
All my life I've dreamed of being 
a career woman, but he says 
I'm not allowed to work!

222
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:28,549
I'm supposed to sit home all day, 
let him take care of me.

223
00:17:28,722 --> 00:17:32,429
So, what do you think, Doc?  
Should I marry him?

224
00:17:35,366 --> 00:17:39,586
Well... taking into account the years 
you've invested in the relationship,

225
00:17:39,754 --> 00:17:44,009
and Jerome's obvious love for you, 
not to mention his generosity...

226
00:17:44,184 --> 00:17:49,818
Tell me what you think, Dr. Crane, 
'cause I really, really respect you.

227
00:17:57,055 --> 00:17:59,098
Brandy... run!
Save yourself.

228
00:17:59,269 --> 00:18:01,313
Do not marry this man.

229
00:18:02,529 --> 00:18:05,107
This is Dr Frasier Crane, 
saying goodbye, and...

230
00:18:06,206 --> 00:18:08,785
...see you, God willing, tomorrow.

231
00:18:12,684 --> 00:18:15,560
Yes, I'll have a non-fat, 
decaf latte, please.

232
00:18:16,486 --> 00:18:21,288
Oh, what the hell?  
Look, make it a full-fat mocha 
with extra whipped cream.

233
00:18:22,379 --> 00:18:25,219
What the hell, 
put a slice of bacon on it!

234
00:18:29,232 --> 00:18:32,904
- Hello, Frasier.
- Niles!  Don't do that!
- Sorry.  Double espresso, please.

235
00:18:33,996 --> 00:18:37,122
I heard you on the radio today.
I thought what you did was noble.

236
00:18:38,551 --> 00:18:42,223
To what South American nation 
will you be fleeing?

237
00:18:42,396 --> 00:18:47,911
Oh, like I'd tell you.  
One minute of interrogation, 
and you would crack like a Jordan almond!

238
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:51,288
Frasier, I never meant for any 
of this to happen.  How long are 
you going to stay mad at me?

239
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:54,970
For as long as I live.  
Which'll probably take us 
through breakfast. 

240
00:18:57,649 --> 00:19:00,192
Oh, wrong again!

241
00:19:00,365 --> 00:19:03,705
Oh, oh look!  It's Jerome Belasco!  
Jerome, take a seat!

242
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:07,548
Look Frasier, it's our friend, 
JEROME BELASCO.

243
00:19:18,167 --> 00:19:23,801
I heard your broadcast this afternoon.  
It displeased me.

244
00:19:24,603 --> 00:19:27,693
Yeah, let me have a little 
hot milk, please.

245
00:19:29,367 --> 00:19:33,158
When I'm displeased I get acid 
in my stomach, Dr. Crane.

246
00:19:33,337 --> 00:19:38,008
Believe me, the last thing I wanted 
to do is displease you.

247
00:19:39,187 --> 00:19:44,322
Or to hear the words "acid" and 
"Dr. Crane" in the same sentence.

248
00:19:46,835 --> 00:19:51,969
But - Jerome, I'm sorry - how could 
I have advised her otherwise?  
She said that you cheated on her.

249
00:19:52,142 --> 00:19:56,444
She said she suspected me!  
I've never cheated on Miss Brandy.

250
00:19:56,613 --> 00:19:58,657
Alright, be that as it may,

251
00:19:58,828 --> 00:20:03,214
how can I advise her to marry a man 
who's so controlling that he won't 
even allow her to work?

252
00:20:03,383 --> 00:20:09,314
It may interest you to know that 
over the years I've called in favors 
to get Miss Brandy fourteen jobs!

253
00:20:10,738 --> 00:20:13,614
She lost all of them.

254
00:20:13,788 --> 00:20:19,672
- So you're saying she's had trouble 
finding her niche?
- No, I'm saying she's a dodo.

255
00:20:22,188 --> 00:20:29,034
Now you may love a dodo; you may think 
the dodo is beautiful; you may even wish 
to marry the dodo. 

256
00:20:29,209 --> 00:20:31,704
But you do not encourage a dodo to fly!

257
00:20:34,558 --> 00:20:40,572
Now, when she loses these jobs 
it makes her very unhappy.  
So, for her sake I said, "No more jobs."

258
00:20:40,742 --> 00:20:47,089
But now, 
in order to convince her to marry me, 
I've had to reverse this policy.

259
00:20:47,262 --> 00:20:51,136
- So she has agreed to marry you?
- If I get her a job.

260
00:20:51,315 --> 00:20:55,867
And not just any job.  
A job that she can never lose.

261
00:20:56,957 --> 00:20:59,250
A job where if she burns 
the place down,

262
00:20:59,422 --> 00:21:02,762
they will apologise to her 
for having made it so flammable.

263
00:21:06,693 --> 00:21:11,031
Well, good luck finding someone 
who'll hire her.

264
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:27,537
Dr. Crane, your brother called.
The court time for your tennis game 
is 11 o'clock.

265
00:21:27,713 --> 00:21:30,470
Oh, good Lord.  I distinctly told him 
I wasn't available until noon.

266
00:21:30,639 --> 00:21:34,976
Hey, if you're going to call him back, 
put it on the speakerphone.

267
00:21:35,152 --> 00:21:39,027
- Don't you think 
this is getting a little old?
- Well I think it's just mean, 
is what I think.

268
00:21:39,205 --> 00:21:41,535
So sue me, I enjoy it.

269
00:21:48,315 --> 00:21:52,618
Good morning!  
Niles Crane, psy-kee-at-trist. 

270
00:21:57,509 --> 00:22:00,135
Yes, is Dr. Crane there?  
This is his brother, Frasier.

271
00:22:00,309 --> 00:22:03,482
Oh hi, Dr. Crane.  
It's me, Brandy.

272
00:22:03,652 --> 00:22:07,788
Hang on, I'm getting another call.
I'll just put you on hold.

273
00:22:13,452 --> 00:22:23,452
