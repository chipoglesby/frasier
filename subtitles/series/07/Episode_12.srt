1
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:09,509
Oh, hey, Frasier.

2
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:10,577
Hmm? Ah.

3
00:00:10,577 --> 00:00:12,078
Ooh, catalogues.

4
00:00:12,078 --> 00:00:13,580
Yes, I'm trying to find

5
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:16,082
the perfect wedding gift
for Daphne and Donny.

6
00:00:16,082 --> 00:00:17,384
Oh, right.

7
00:00:17,384 --> 00:00:19,185
Well, now that
they've set a date,

8
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:21,521
I guess I'll be getting
my bridesmaid draft notice.

9
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:23,323
You know, Roz,
she may not even ask you.

10
00:00:23,323 --> 00:00:25,258
Oh, she'll ask me.

11
00:00:25,258 --> 00:00:26,126
They all do.

12
00:00:26,126 --> 00:00:27,427
Ah.

13
00:00:27,427 --> 00:00:28,828
The next thing I know,

14
00:00:28,828 --> 00:00:30,330
I'm wearing some revolting
puffy-sleeved dress

15
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:32,832
made from the same material
that keeps the space shuttle

16
00:00:32,832 --> 00:00:34,868
from burning up during reentry.

17
00:00:36,136 --> 00:00:37,937
You know, Roz,
Daphne might just surprise you

18
00:00:37,937 --> 00:00:39,239
and pick a dress you like.

19
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:41,007
Oh, impossible.
They're always ugly.

20
00:00:41,007 --> 00:00:42,542
That's the way
the bride makes sure

21
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:43,977
she's the prettiest one
at her wedding.

22
00:00:43,977 --> 00:00:45,412
Gee, that's awfully
cynical.

23
00:00:45,412 --> 00:00:47,414
Oh, yeah? When was the last time
you found yourself

24
00:00:47,414 --> 00:00:49,716
staring at a bridesmaid
instead of the bride?

25
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:52,419
That would've been at
my wedding to Lilith.

26
00:00:55,855 --> 00:00:56,856
Hello, Frasier.

27
00:00:56,856 --> 00:00:58,224
Oh, Niles!

28
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:00,060
Frasier, do you remember
the time the Kriezel brothers

29
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,062
tied me to their Great Dane
and lobbed meatballs

30
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:04,531
down their gravel driveway?

31
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:06,966
I've told you, Niles,
I would've helped you,

32
00:01:06,966 --> 00:01:09,469
but their sister
was holding me down.

33
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:10,403
No, my point is--

34
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:11,971
a cappuccino, please--

35
00:01:11,971 --> 00:01:13,473
even that experience
was less painful

36
00:01:13,473 --> 00:01:14,974
than the date
I was just on.

37
00:01:14,974 --> 00:01:17,977
She was...

38
00:01:17,977 --> 00:01:20,246
a cat person.

39
00:01:21,881 --> 00:01:23,650
She brought her cat on our date.

40
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:25,418
Oh, Lord.

41
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:27,720
Well, she had good reason--
it was Mr. Waggles' birthday.

42
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,222
Oh, dear.

43
00:01:29,222 --> 00:01:31,224
Actually,
his birthday party.

44
00:01:31,224 --> 00:01:32,225
Oh.

45
00:01:32,225 --> 00:01:34,227
Actually, his surprise
birthday party.

46
00:01:34,227 --> 00:01:35,995
Oh, Niles,
I'm sorry.

47
00:01:35,995 --> 00:01:38,565
Where on earth
did you meet this woman?

48
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:40,867
At Nordstroms. We both reached
for the same cashmere throw.

49
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:42,368
When she said
she needed something

50
00:01:42,368 --> 00:01:43,870
to keep her waggles warm

51
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:46,272
I thought it was
a coy euphemism, but...

52
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:47,674
Thank you.

53
00:01:47,674 --> 00:01:49,175
Yes. Well, Niles,

54
00:01:49,175 --> 00:01:50,677
I certainly understand
your being upset,

55
00:01:50,677 --> 00:01:52,412
but you know you've got
to keep on looking.

56
00:01:52,412 --> 00:01:54,214
Well, trust me,
with Daphne getting married

57
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:55,715
I have no choice
but to press on.

58
00:01:55,715 --> 00:01:57,217
But I'm going to change
my strategy.

59
00:01:57,217 --> 00:01:59,719
Do you recall the other day
at the health club

60
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:01,154
Tony Hubner gave me
that phone number?

61
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:02,922
Dear God, Niles,
not a dating service.

62
00:02:02,922 --> 00:02:05,291
No. It's not a dating service.

63
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:08,695
It's an introduction network
for busy professionals.

64
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:10,597
I give them
my vital statistics

65
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:11,564
and there's an extensive

66
00:02:11,564 --> 00:02:12,565
screening process.

67
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:14,534
They bill me
at the end of the month.

68
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:15,935
Niles, please,

69
00:02:15,935 --> 00:02:18,304
they are all
money-grabbing con artists

70
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:20,707
who prey on the pathetic
and the lonely.

71
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:22,942
For God's sake, you
sign up with visions

72
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:25,745
of some Ph.D. candidate
and what do they deliver?

73
00:02:25,745 --> 00:02:27,280
A buck-toothed librarian

74
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,316
who needs help
washing her mother.

75
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:34,053
Are you really
that desperate?

76
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:35,421
Half an hour ago,

77
00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:37,390
I had my left leg tethered
to Mr. Waggles' forepaw

78
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:41,828
and we came in third
in the five-legged race.

79
00:02:43,796 --> 00:02:46,599
Geez, you'd think they'd
let him win on his birthday.

80
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:54,440
I know, Mum, but
it is my wedding.

81
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,442
I've given in to you
on so many things.

82
00:02:56,442 --> 00:02:58,411
Couldn't this one
thing go my way?

83
00:02:58,411 --> 00:03:01,881
I just don't like
those tiny corns in me salad.

84
00:03:01,881 --> 00:03:05,618
No, I don't hate you.

85
00:03:05,618 --> 00:03:08,388
Well, that's just not true.

86
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:10,390
I'm glad you're alive.

87
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:11,891
All right, all right.

88
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:13,393
Tiny corn it is.

89
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:14,394
I've got to run now.

90
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:15,361
Cheery-bye.

91
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:16,896
(sighs)

92
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:17,897
That was Mum.

93
00:03:17,897 --> 00:03:18,898
Mmm.

94
00:03:18,898 --> 00:03:20,300
She had a thought
about the salad.

95
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,801
Something told me

96
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:24,304
yesterday's crouton skirmish
wasn't the end of it.

97
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:27,073
I suppose she can be
a bit overbearing,

98
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:28,908
but, as she often
points out,

99
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:30,910
she is paying
for the wedding,

100
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,345
and I am her
only daughter,

101
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:34,847
and giving birth to me
was so painful

102
00:03:34,847 --> 00:03:37,684
she did bite through
a kitchen spoon.

103
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:40,353
Daphne...

104
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:41,688
just don't let your mother
guilt you

105
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:43,723
into having the wedding
that she wants

106
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:44,991
instead of the wedding you want.

107
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:45,792
Oh, don't worry.

108
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:46,793
Mum already
promised me

109
00:03:47,293 --> 00:03:48,795
I could have the
wedding I want...

110
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:51,631
as soon as I have a daughter
who gets engaged.

111
00:03:52,465 --> 00:03:53,933
Oh, hey, Dad.

112
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:55,435
Oh, Fras...

113
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:56,936
you're going to
love this stuff

114
00:03:56,936 --> 00:03:58,938
I got from the
farmer's market.

115
00:03:58,938 --> 00:04:01,441
This guy takes
the juiciest cut
of filet mignon,

116
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:03,943
slices it real
thin and makes
jerky out of it.

117
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:05,445
Oh, Dad,
I'm not really in...

118
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:06,412
Not bad, huh?

119
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:12,151
Yes, if only I had a nice
powdered cabernet to go with it.

120
00:04:12,151 --> 00:04:13,386
Dad, listen...

121
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:14,854
have you given any thought

122
00:04:14,854 --> 00:04:15,855
to Daphne's wedding present?

123
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:18,358
Oh, now, Frasier, not
everybody likes jerky

124
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:19,859
as much as you and me.

125
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:20,860
No, Dad...

126
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:23,263
No, no, I just
want to get her
something special.

127
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,665
Especially since her mother
seems to be taking all the joy

128
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:26,633
out of it for her.

129
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:28,501
Oh, how about a nice
piece of luggage?

130
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:30,670
You know,
a good, hard suitcase,

131
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,538
like the kind people
used to put stickers on

132
00:04:32,538 --> 00:04:33,539
to show everybody
where they'd been.

133
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:34,507
Remember your grandad's?

134
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:35,541
Mm-hmm.

135
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:37,043
His whole life
was on it.

136
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:40,546
Topeka, Sioux Falls,
Biloxi.

137
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:43,416
It was like a map
of the world.

138
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:44,784
Yes, what a loss to us all

139
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,753
that he failed
to write his memoirs.

140
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:49,088
I'm thinking of something
that would matter to Daphne.

141
00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:52,959
(hiccuping):
Something that shows her
how we feel-- good Lord.

142
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,927
A little spicy,
wasn't it?

143
00:04:54,927 --> 00:04:58,364
You know, maybe we
should get something
for her wedding.

144
00:04:58,364 --> 00:04:59,432
Like what?

145
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:01,434
I don't know, uh...

146
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:03,403
the flowers, say.

147
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:04,437
That's it.

148
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:06,706
We could offer to pay
for her wedding flowers.

149
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:07,507
Wow, that's a bit pricey,
isn't it?

150
00:05:08,007 --> 00:05:08,841
Don't worry
about it, Dad.

151
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:10,677
(hiccuping):
You just donate

152
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:12,211
what you can,
and I'll pay for the rest.

153
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:14,180
Good God, what was
in that jerky?

154
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,682
You just ate it too fast.

155
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:17,116
Next time,
you have to savor it a little.

156
00:05:17,116 --> 00:05:19,085
Trust me, Dad, I'm never going
to taste that vile stuff again.

157
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:21,854
(hiccuping):
Oop. Spoke too soon.

158
00:05:21,854 --> 00:05:23,589
Mmm...

159
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:25,591
Daphne, may I have a
word with you, please?

160
00:05:25,591 --> 00:05:27,126
What is it, Dr. Crane?

161
00:05:27,126 --> 00:05:28,127
Well...

162
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:29,429
it's about your
wedding gift.

163
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:31,064
Now...

164
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:33,833
I know it's not traditionally
the role of a friend,

165
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,335
but we consider you family

166
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,836
so please don't say no.

167
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,805
Dad and I would be honored
to pay for your wedding...

168
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:40,640
(hiccups)

169
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,441
Pay for my wedding?

170
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:42,742
(hiccups)

171
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:43,910
How wonderful!

172
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:47,113
(hiccuping)

173
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:50,717
That's the most generous gift
I could ever imagine!

174
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:51,951
What's all
the hubbub?

175
00:05:51,951 --> 00:05:53,353
Dr. Crane just told me

176
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:54,854
about your incredible
wedding present!

177
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,856
Oh!

178
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:59,659
You people are heaven-sent.

179
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:00,960
Well, I'm glad
you like it and...

180
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,462
and you know what?

181
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:03,796
We're going to throw in

182
00:06:03,796 --> 00:06:05,064
a piece of
luggage, as well.

183
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:07,033
I'm just so
overwhelmed.

184
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,534
See, I told you.

185
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:09,535
Everybody loves luggage.

186
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:11,037
Dad!

187
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,039
She thinks we're paying
for her whole wedding.

188
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,040
What?!

189
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,042
Well, I tried to say
"wedding flowers"

190
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,009
but then I hiccuped.

191
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:18,945
I'm not paying
for a wedding.
Of course not.

192
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:20,380
I'll just clear this
whole thing right up

193
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,181
right now before it goes
any further. Daphne!

194
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:24,050
You know what this
means, don't you?

195
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,051
Now that Mum's
not paying,

196
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,886
she can't make me
have it in England.

197
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:29,088
I can have my wedding
how I want it

198
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:30,890
and where I want it right here.

199
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,859
You've answered my prayers.

200
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:34,360
(sobbing)

201
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:37,730
(doorbell rings)

202
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,565
DAPHNE:
Could someone
let Donny in?

203
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:40,933
Oh, well, look...

204
00:06:40,933 --> 00:06:42,335
Donny's a very
traditional guy.

205
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:44,270
He's not going to let us
pay for his wedding.

206
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,805
Right.

207
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:47,840
You saw how he proposed
to her-- on bended knee.

208
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,609
He's nothing if not
a hopeless romantic.

209
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:52,879
Any idiot knows you got to pay
a hooker in cash.

210
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:54,881
I'm in a meeting.
I'll call you later. Bye.

211
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:56,883
Hey, guys.
How you doing?
Hi, Donny.

212
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:59,352
I got this client--
he's in the middle
of a divorce, right?

213
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:00,820
And his wife
finds all these charges

214
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,822
from this place
called Executive Match.

215
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:04,323
Turns out to be
a call girl service.

216
00:07:04,323 --> 00:07:05,825
Oh, boy,
when she gets through with him,

217
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:07,326
she'll have
his house, his car...

218
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:10,329
She'd have his beach house, too,
if I hadn't already taken it.

219
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:11,164
Women.

220
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:12,832
DONNY:
Hi, honey.

221
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:14,133
Hi, sweetie.

222
00:07:16,135 --> 00:07:17,170
Have they
told you yet?

223
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:18,171
Uh... told me what?

224
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:19,672
You're not going
to believe this

225
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:21,174
but Dr. Crane
and his father

226
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:23,543
have offered to pay
for our entire wedding.

227
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:25,378
(weak chuckle)

228
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:26,879
Is this a joke?

229
00:07:30,716 --> 00:07:33,152
It could be.

230
00:07:33,152 --> 00:07:34,554
Just a minute.
Honey, it's one thing

231
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:35,521
for us
to let your family pay.

232
00:07:35,521 --> 00:07:37,523
They're your parents
and it's traditional,

233
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:38,825
but this is...

234
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:40,626
Going too far?
Being presumptuous?

235
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:41,928
We don't want to
step on any toes.

236
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:44,063
I didn't think you'd be
uncomfortable with this.

237
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:45,364
But he clearly is,
Daphne.

238
00:07:45,364 --> 00:07:46,365
Donny's right.
We're not family.

239
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:47,366
Absolutely.

240
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:48,868
You know, we've
got that thing....

241
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:50,870
Wait, wait a minute--
what am I doing?

242
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:51,838
Here you guys...

243
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:53,773
you're making
this lovely gesture

244
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:55,074
and I'm just insulting you.

245
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:57,243
No, no, no,
I mean, if
you guys

246
00:07:57,243 --> 00:07:59,912
are not family to Daphne,
then who is?

247
00:07:59,912 --> 00:08:01,714
Of course you can pay
for the wedding.

248
00:08:01,714 --> 00:08:03,115
Thank you, thank you.

249
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:05,985
Thank you, family.

250
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:08,488
I just knew he'd see how
much this meant to you.

251
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,889
Oh, God, I'm
tearing up again.

252
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:11,290
Don't start
with the waterworks

253
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:12,758
because you're going
to get me going here.

254
00:08:12,758 --> 00:08:13,793
What is that, jerky?

255
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:15,294
Could I have
some of that?

256
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:16,295
Help yourself.

257
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:17,663
"Made from filet mignon."

258
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,432
How much did this stuff
set you back?

259
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:21,868
You have no idea.

260
00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:30,877
Now, as far as
the reception goes

261
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:32,311
I've narrowed it down
to two places.

262
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:34,247
I'm leaning towards
Captain Jonah's.

263
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:36,249
The view of the water's lovely

264
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:39,218
but you have to walk through
a whale's mouth to get inside.

265
00:08:39,218 --> 00:08:42,655
I hesitate to ask
how you exit.

266
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:46,225
Got to run.

267
00:08:46,225 --> 00:08:47,927
I have a meeting
with the DJ.

268
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:51,264
(heavy sigh)

269
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:53,266
I thought she'd
never leave.

270
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:54,767
Well... good God, Roz.

271
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:56,269
How long have
you been there?

272
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:58,771
Since you two walked
in and trapped me.

273
00:08:58,771 --> 00:09:00,273
Aren't you taking this thing
a bit too far

274
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:02,275
just trying to avoid
an unflattering dress?

275
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:03,776
Yeah, I thought
you'd say that.

276
00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:05,778
That's why I've been
carrying around this picture

277
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:07,246
of the last time
I was a bridesmaid.

278
00:09:07,246 --> 00:09:11,017
Good Lord, Roz, you look like
you've been tented for termites.

279
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:13,686
Exactly.

280
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:18,591
Well, it sounds like she's
having fun planning her wedding.

281
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,326
Yes, now that she can
have things her way

282
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:21,227
and not
her mother's.

283
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:22,562
She's lucky you came along.

284
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,263
Well, yes and no.

285
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:27,099
You know, I sit here
and let her make...

286
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:30,102
questionable choices...

287
00:09:30,102 --> 00:09:32,572
and I say nothing because I know
it's going to cost me less.

288
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,106
I'm sorry.
You know what?

289
00:09:34,106 --> 00:09:36,576
I've got to change
my thinking about
this whole thing.

290
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,544
I mean, what good is my money

291
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:41,047
if I'm denying her the best gift
I have to offer--

292
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:43,549
my taste and expertise.

293
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:49,055
Frankly, what Daphne really
deserves is the gift of Frasier.

294
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:54,026
Suddenly that crock pot
I'm giving them

295
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:55,027
doesn't sound so bad.

296
00:09:55,027 --> 00:09:55,962
Oh, shut up.

297
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:00,366
Hello, Niles.

298
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:01,701
You look like a man
who's waiting

299
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:03,069
to be asked
why he's grinning.

300
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:05,438
Oh, I was just thinkin'...

301
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:06,939
about the other day
when you said

302
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,942
how you thought dating services
were all a big con.

303
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:10,943
Well, I just got conned

304
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,945
into meeting
the most enchanting woman.

305
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:14,880
Well, I don't know
what to say.

306
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,716
And I owe it all
to Executive Match.

307
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:18,618
Now I do.

308
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:22,488
The name of this service
is Executive Match?

309
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:24,790
That's right. You thought
these women were all beneath me.

310
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,258
Beneath you and
countless others.

311
00:10:26,258 --> 00:10:27,493
Do you have any idea...?

312
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:28,794
Shh. Here she is.

313
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:29,795
Sabrina, could...?

314
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:31,297
Oh, sorry.

315
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,598
She's always
on the phone.

316
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:36,569
Whatever it is
she does for a living,

317
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:38,371
she's in great demand.

318
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:41,073
So you have no idea
what line of work Sabrina's in?

319
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:43,042
No. I'm guessing
high-priced lawyer.

320
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:45,044
I heard her quote
her hourly rate on the phone.

321
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:46,545
Believe me,
you don't want to be

322
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:48,047
on the receiving end
of that bill.

323
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:49,548
(chuckling)

324
00:10:49,548 --> 00:10:50,349
Niles...

325
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:51,684
I feel I must warn you...

326
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:52,985
oh, now, please

327
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:54,320
spare me your
condescending advice.

328
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,288
Why can't you simply
say you were wrong?

329
00:10:56,288 --> 00:10:58,057
You have no idea
what you're doing.

330
00:10:58,057 --> 00:11:01,360
I know exactly what I'm doing.

331
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,362
And you could learn
a thing or two from me,

332
00:11:03,362 --> 00:11:05,164
Mr. One-date-and-it's-over.

333
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:09,468
I am taking it slow
with Sabrina.

334
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:11,170
You mean you
haven't...?
Haven't...?

335
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,338
You know... haven't?
Haven't...?

336
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:13,706
Oh, please. Are you mad?

337
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:15,708
You don't proposition
a woman like that

338
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:17,143
on the first date.

339
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:18,878
Last night
after dinner

340
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:20,212
I dropped her home
with nothing more

341
00:11:20,212 --> 00:11:21,681
than a courtly kiss
on the wrist.

342
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:24,717
Tonight may proceed
to hand-holding.

343
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:26,218
And if all goes well,
in two weeks,

344
00:11:26,218 --> 00:11:29,221
I shall storm the citadel
of her womanhood.

345
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:34,126
Mmm... Sabrina...

346
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:36,362
(chuckling)

347
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:37,697
This is Frasier.

348
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:38,964
Hello. Lovely
to meet you.

349
00:11:38,964 --> 00:11:40,466
Nice to meet you.

350
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:42,702
You really have a great brother.

351
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,503
Oh, he's charming
and witty

352
00:11:44,503 --> 00:11:47,006
and intelligent
and handsome.

353
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:48,007
(chuckling)

354
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:50,443
I paid her to say that.

355
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:52,678
Of course you did.

356
00:11:57,383 --> 00:12:00,453
(doorbell rings)

357
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:03,355
Ah, finally,
the doves have arrived.

358
00:12:03,355 --> 00:12:04,290
Come in. Come in.

359
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:06,125
Lazlo, thank you
so much for coming.

360
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:06,959
Lovely flowers.

361
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,494
I'll let you know.

362
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:11,464
Dr. Crane, was that
the florist for my wedding?

363
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:13,966
In his dreams!

364
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:14,967
Good God.

365
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:17,470
The man's arrangements
are one big cliche.

366
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:18,471
Look at this.

367
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:20,506
His answer to everything
is baby's breath,

368
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:23,008
baby's breath,
baby's breath.

369
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:24,510
Does that woman with the harp

370
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,812
have something to do
with my wedding, too?

371
00:12:26,812 --> 00:12:29,048
No, Daphne,
she's selling them door-to-door.

372
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:31,751
Of course it's
for your wedding.

373
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:32,585
She's auditioning.

374
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,587
Dr. Crane, I really
don't think...

375
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,555
MARTIN:
Oh, good, Daphne.
You're here, too.

376
00:12:36,555 --> 00:12:39,892
Listen, I want
to show you guys
a little something

377
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:41,727
I thought up
for the wedding.

378
00:12:41,727 --> 00:12:44,230
"It is now the time
in the ceremony for the rings.

379
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,998
May I have them,
please?"

380
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,905
'Course, it's
a lot more effective

381
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:54,807
when he's in his little tux.

382
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:55,708
Dad, please.

383
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:58,511
It's all just
a bit much, isn't it?

384
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:00,813
We don't want to
turn this wedding
into a circus.

385
00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:02,314
Now, where's the dove man?

386
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:03,749
Dr. Crane, about
the doves...

387
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:05,151
Just picture it, Daphne.

388
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,886
Aren't they
something?

389
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:08,754
As you and Donny
exit the church,

390
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:10,256
one dozen white
birds of peace

391
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:12,258
will be released
and circle above.

392
00:13:12,758 --> 00:13:14,260
Of course, we'll
use 14, actually.

393
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,762
The power lines
always take out a few.

394
00:13:18,764 --> 00:13:20,266
Thank you so much.

395
00:13:22,768 --> 00:13:24,203
Dr. Crane,

396
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:25,671
about the doves,

397
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:27,173
it just seems a little grand.

398
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:30,042
I mean, what's wrong
with throwing a bit of rice?

399
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:32,444
Oh, well, uh,
if you want rice,

400
00:13:32,444 --> 00:13:34,713
of course,
you'll have rice.

401
00:13:34,713 --> 00:13:37,516
Sometimes it seems
nothing I do is good enough.

402
00:13:37,516 --> 00:13:38,517
No, no, no.

403
00:13:38,517 --> 00:13:40,019
I-I suppose doves
will be fine.

404
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:43,022
Frasier, is that Reverend
Franklin in the kitchen?

405
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:44,390
Yes, it is, Dad.

406
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,659
You're auditioning our minister
for the wedding?

407
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,060
Don't you think Donny and I

408
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,995
should have a say
in who marries us?

409
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:50,963
Of course, Daphne.

410
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:53,332
I'm just whittling down
the possibilities.

411
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,568
The final choice
is yours.

412
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:57,403
Who's tasting
the first course?

413
00:13:57,403 --> 00:13:58,370
Oh, that'd be me.

414
00:13:58,370 --> 00:13:59,705
Who's that?

415
00:13:59,705 --> 00:14:02,107
That's Chef Marco
from the Mercer Club, Daphne.

416
00:14:02,107 --> 00:14:04,610
Today we'll be sampling
each of our four courses.

417
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:05,477
No.

418
00:14:05,477 --> 00:14:07,313
I was planning
on serving a buffet.

419
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:08,814
That way, people can mingle.

420
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:09,815
It's more festive.

421
00:14:09,815 --> 00:14:10,783
(doorbell rings)

422
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:14,720
Daphne, we are talking
about your wedding,

423
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:16,722
not brunch with all the fixin's

424
00:14:16,722 --> 00:14:19,658
at Billy Bob's
Blackjack Boomtown.

425
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:22,361
Ah.

426
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:23,863
Hello, Frasier.
You remember Sabrina.

427
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:25,364
Yes, of course.
Lovely to see you.

428
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:26,866
Niles, what are
you doing here?

429
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,868
Oh, we're out for an afternoon
of bird watching.

430
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,803
It's the start
of mating season, you know.

431
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:36,008
Just wanted to introduce
my new girlfriend to Dad.

432
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:36,909
Dad, this is Sabrina.

433
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:38,878
Hi. Nice to meet you.

434
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,379
Nice to meet you, too.

435
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:41,881
I should really
call my office.

436
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,383
About how long
do you think
we'll be gone?

437
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:45,384
Uh, about eight hours.

438
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:46,886
Great.

439
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:54,126
Ooh, Daphne, I didn't know
you were going to be here.

440
00:14:54,126 --> 00:14:56,128
I just want to drop these off
for Frasier.

441
00:14:56,128 --> 00:14:57,630
Oh, Roz, I'm glad
you dropped by.

442
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,632
I need to talk to you
about my wedding.

443
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:01,400
Do you mind if we speak
in the hallway?

444
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,135
Actually, I don't
have much time.

445
00:15:03,135 --> 00:15:04,637
Well, then, I'll
get right to it.

446
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:06,705
Excuse me. Do you know
where Dr. Crane lives?

447
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:08,207
Right here.
Can I help you?

448
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:10,676
I'm dropping off
this bridesmaid's dress.

449
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:11,677
Oh, I'll take that.

450
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:12,978
I'm the bride.
Thanks.

451
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:14,747
What I need to ask
you is, how do you

452
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:17,216
ever get Dr. Crane
to listen to you?

453
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:18,717
Is that
the bridesmaid dress?

454
00:15:18,717 --> 00:15:20,119
He's driving
me mad.

455
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:21,820
He doesn't listen
to anything I say.

456
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,690
The women you asked
to be bridesmaids
get to wear this?

457
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:26,191
And the worst
part is...

458
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:27,559
is that silk?
Well, he's just

459
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:29,428
like my mother--
controlling and stubborn.

460
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:30,863
I mean, what am I going to do?

461
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:32,798
Well, Daphne,
it's your wedding.

462
00:15:32,798 --> 00:15:35,734
Just tell Frasier
how you feel.

463
00:15:35,734 --> 00:15:37,636
Well, that's
a bit difficult for me.

464
00:15:37,636 --> 00:15:40,105
You see, there was
no talking to my mother.

465
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,641
Anytime I so much as tried,
all I'd hear is,

466
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:43,642
"Just do it my way.

467
00:15:43,642 --> 00:15:45,144
You'll thank me later."

468
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:48,547
Every time she said that,
I just wanted to explode.

469
00:15:48,547 --> 00:15:50,416
Look, Frasier's
a reasonable guy.

470
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,751
Just go in there
and be direct.

471
00:15:52,751 --> 00:15:54,086
You're right.

472
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:55,988
I'm going to.

473
00:15:57,323 --> 00:15:58,891
Oh, and Roz...

474
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:00,392
I was going to ask you

475
00:16:00,392 --> 00:16:03,395
if you wanted to be
one of me bridesmaids.

476
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:04,897
Oh, my God!

477
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:05,898
Are you serious?!

478
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:07,299
Yes.

479
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:11,103
Oh, this is coming
out of nowhere.

480
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:12,104
I'd love to!

481
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:13,505
Oh, great.

482
00:16:13,505 --> 00:16:14,340
And don't worry.

483
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:17,409
Once I'm in charge,
you won't have to wear

484
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:19,278
this thing Dr. Crane
picked out.

485
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:21,680
I mean, he calls this
a bridesmaid's dress.

486
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,549
The sleeves aren't even poofy.

487
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:29,121
So, how long have you guys
been seeing each other?

488
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:30,556
Well, let's see,
since we've met,

489
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:35,561
it's been about, uh, 17...
no, 18 hours.

490
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:37,563
She actually counts
the minutes

491
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:39,064
we've been together.

492
00:16:39,064 --> 00:16:39,999
FRASIER:
Niles...

493
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,800
may I see you in the kitchen?

494
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,635
Excuse me.

495
00:16:43,635 --> 00:16:46,105
Dr. Crane, I need
to talk to you.

496
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:46,839
Not now, Daphne.

497
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,207
All right.

498
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:51,877
All right, what is it?

499
00:16:51,877 --> 00:16:53,846
Niles, it's
about Sabrina.

500
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:56,815
She's a prostitute.

501
00:16:58,217 --> 00:17:01,653
Frasier, I don't like lawyers
any more than you do.

502
00:17:03,555 --> 00:17:05,391
But frankly,
a man whose face

503
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:07,226
is plastered
on every bus in town

504
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:09,695
should be careful what terms
he bandies about.

505
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:10,996
Oh, Niles, Niles!

506
00:17:10,996 --> 00:17:14,633
Executive Match
is an escort service.

507
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:17,436
One of Donny's clients
was caught using them.

508
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:19,271
I don't believe you.

509
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:23,575
Niles, does Sabrina laugh

510
00:17:23,575 --> 00:17:25,010
at everything
you say?

511
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:28,914
Is she fascinated by
everything about you?

512
00:17:28,914 --> 00:17:30,783
Even your collections?

513
00:17:31,683 --> 00:17:34,686
Well, yes... actually.

514
00:17:34,686 --> 00:17:37,189
I even showed her
my rarely seen collection

515
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:41,093
of 18th century
Portuguese bud vases.

516
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:43,962
And how did she react?

517
00:17:43,962 --> 00:17:47,966
Well, if you must know,
she was rather aroused.

518
00:17:47,966 --> 00:17:50,969
She said she loved a man
who collected porcelain,

519
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:52,471
and, oh, my God!

520
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:54,473
I'm dating a whore.

521
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,949
They have
my credit card number.

522
00:18:03,949 --> 00:18:05,451
I've been running up a tab.

523
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:08,454
I've got to get her
out of here!

524
00:18:08,454 --> 00:18:09,922
Sabrina, we
should be going.

525
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:10,856
What's the hurry?

526
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:12,825
We're having a
nice conversation.

527
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:13,826
Yeah. I love your dad.

528
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:15,627
Did he mention
he used to be a police officer.

529
00:18:15,627 --> 00:18:16,929
Maybe we should go.

530
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:22,034
Surely you can
stay a little while.

531
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:23,802
I... I haven't
seen Niles in ages.

532
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:25,571
I used to teach him
in Sunday school.

533
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:26,405
Oh, you know,
Reverend,

534
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:28,774
I can still remember
dropping him off

535
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:29,775
for his first class.

536
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:31,743
Seems like only yesterday.

537
00:18:31,743 --> 00:18:34,179
(harp playing)

538
00:18:43,088 --> 00:18:46,825
Oh, Daphne, I believe
I have chosen your bouquet.

539
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:50,362
It's handwoven
out of pygmy orchids.

540
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:53,365
Dr. Crane, I really
need to talk to you.

541
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:54,366
Well, of course.

542
00:18:54,366 --> 00:18:55,868
First, let's sit

543
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:57,336
and sample the
porcini mushrooms.

544
00:18:57,336 --> 00:18:58,637
They're exquisite.

545
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:00,339
But I don't like mushrooms.

546
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:01,840
Oh, you only think you don't.

547
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,675
You haven't tried these. Here.

548
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:05,511
Dr. Crane, this is really
difficult for me.

549
00:19:05,511 --> 00:19:06,512
Just try this for me.

550
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:08,013
Come on. You'll
thank me later.

551
00:19:08,013 --> 00:19:10,516
"You'll thank me later"?

552
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:12,518
I've heard that my whole life.

553
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:14,520
Well, no more.

554
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:18,023
I'm doing my wedding my way,

555
00:19:18,023 --> 00:19:20,893
and if that means
I want rice instead of doves

556
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:24,129
and a DJ instead of a harp,
then that's what I'll have.

557
00:19:24,129 --> 00:19:25,464
I don't want your advice!

558
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:27,466
I don't want your money!

559
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:28,967
And I don't want
your mushrooms!

560
00:19:28,967 --> 00:19:31,270
I'm in charge of
this wedding now.

561
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:34,072
And what kind of a git
walks down the aisle

562
00:19:34,072 --> 00:19:37,009
carrying something
called pygmy orchids?!

563
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:39,711
(gasps)

564
00:19:39,711 --> 00:19:43,515
(harp playing "Wedding March")

565
00:19:50,422 --> 00:19:52,925
Is she all right?

566
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:54,426
She's fine.

567
00:19:54,426 --> 00:19:56,929
We had a nice talk.

568
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:58,430
That's good.

569
00:19:58,430 --> 00:19:59,765
Wedding still on track?

570
00:19:59,765 --> 00:20:01,433
Absolutely.

571
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:04,203
You just got a little
carried away, that's all.

572
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,204
Oh, I guess so,
yeah.

573
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,172
You know, it suddenly
occurred to me

574
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:08,707
when I was talking to Daphne
that...

575
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:11,577
I never really got the wedding
of my dreams, either.

576
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:13,212
Oh, sure,
you know,

577
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,514
my first one,
some little clandestine affair.

578
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:17,516
We dashed off to City Hall.

579
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:21,019
Could hardly imagine a wedding
more lacking in ceremony

580
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:23,522
till my second wedding...

581
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:26,858
which was lacking a bride.

582
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:30,729
And then came Lilith.

583
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:32,231
If I knew then what I know now,

584
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:35,234
I would have walked down the
aisle with the ice sculpture,

585
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:38,537
had her stand by the buffet
table to keep the shrimp cold.

586
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:44,109
Oh, so you had
a few bad weddings.

587
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:48,413
Guess I was just taking
my last best shot

588
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:52,251
at the wedding
I will never have for myself.

589
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,619
Oh, come on.

590
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:55,120
Oh, let's
face it, Dad--

591
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,022
I'm no
spring chicken.

592
00:20:57,022 --> 00:20:59,391
You really see me
getting married again?

593
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:02,828
Well... I guess
I've had my doubts,

594
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:06,331
but right here, right now,

595
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:09,301
I think yeah, you're going
to meet someone.

596
00:21:09,301 --> 00:21:10,235
You really think so?

597
00:21:10,235 --> 00:21:11,470
Yes, I do.

598
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:12,738
And I'll tell you why.

599
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:15,774
If Niles can meet
a great gal like Sabrina,

600
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:18,577
then there's hope for all of us.
