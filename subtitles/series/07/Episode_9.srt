1
00:00:09,442 --> 00:00:10,443
Dr. Crane.

2
00:00:10,443 --> 00:00:11,444
Hello, Daphne.

3
00:00:11,444 --> 00:00:12,445
Is Dad around?

4
00:00:12,445 --> 00:00:13,947
I have that videotape
he wanted to see.

5
00:00:13,947 --> 00:00:15,682
Actually, he's gone off
with Donny.

6
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:16,983
They went
to a tractor pull.

7
00:00:16,983 --> 00:00:18,918
Oh...

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,788
As I understand it,

9
00:00:21,788 --> 00:00:23,356
they attach a
large weight

10
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:24,858
to a tractor
and see how far

11
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:26,126
they can pull it
through the mud.

12
00:00:26,126 --> 00:00:28,428
Oh.

13
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:30,997
The answer to your
next question is

14
00:00:30,997 --> 00:00:32,866
"Beats the hell
out of me."

15
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:34,134
(door opens)

16
00:00:34,134 --> 00:00:36,803
Oh, hello, Daphne, Niles.

17
00:00:36,803 --> 00:00:38,605
Hello, Frasier.
Oh, Dr. Crane,

18
00:00:38,605 --> 00:00:41,374
I see you've
grown yourself
a crumb catcher.

19
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:44,144
Oh, please. Spare me
your jocular euphemisms.

20
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:45,645
I've heard them all from Freddy.

21
00:00:45,645 --> 00:00:49,916
My chin sweater, my face fuzz,
my hickey-hider.

22
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:51,151
(chuckles)

23
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:52,152
Well, I think it suits you.

24
00:00:52,652 --> 00:00:53,653
Well, thank you,
Niles.

25
00:00:53,653 --> 00:00:55,455
I just wanted to shake things up
a bit, you know.

26
00:00:55,455 --> 00:00:57,090
How was Boston?

27
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:57,791
Oh, it was fine.

28
00:00:57,791 --> 00:00:58,858
It was great
seeing Freddy again.

29
00:00:58,858 --> 00:01:00,326
Of course,
Lilith was insufferable,

30
00:01:00,326 --> 00:01:01,828
but she's got a new boyfriend--

31
00:01:01,828 --> 00:01:03,296
some 28-year-old named Marcel.

32
00:01:03,296 --> 00:01:04,798
He's a contortionist

33
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:07,867
with the Cirque
du Soleil.

34
00:01:07,867 --> 00:01:10,870
She's dating French circus folk?

35
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:12,138
Yes, well,

36
00:01:12,138 --> 00:01:12,906
he's actually perfect
for Lilith.

37
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:14,407
He has no apparent spine,

38
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:16,376
and she can wrap him
around her finger.

39
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:20,914
Of course, Lilith's
smug satisfaction

40
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,415
was a little hard
to bear, though...

41
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:23,850
especially considering
how long it's been

42
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:27,420
since the circus came
to my town.

43
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,388
(door opens)
DONNY:
I know.

44
00:01:28,388 --> 00:01:31,357
I couldn't believe
the wheel that thing had...

45
00:01:31,357 --> 00:01:33,359
It's Grizzly Crane.

46
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:35,295
Well, nice soup strainer
there, Fras.

47
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:36,229
Thank you.

48
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:37,664
DONNY:
Oh, we just saw a hell
of a tractor pull.

49
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:39,466
Even you would have liked it.

50
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:40,900
So, how's
my grandson?

51
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:41,835
Oh, he's great, Dad.

52
00:01:41,835 --> 00:01:43,503
Actually, he loved
the baseball mitt you sent him.

53
00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:45,305
Where's Daphne?
I got this little gift for her.

54
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:46,806
Oh, a John Deere cap.

55
00:01:46,806 --> 00:01:50,110
How... could you?

56
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:50,944
(doorbell rings)
Oh, you know,
I'm just giving it to her

57
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:52,412
to see her pretend
to like it,

58
00:01:52,412 --> 00:01:56,416
and then I'm going to give her
a bracelet.

59
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:57,917
Hey, Frasier.
Oh, hi, Roz.

60
00:01:57,917 --> 00:01:58,952
Mm, cool beard.

61
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,253
Oh, thanks.
Hey, Niles.

62
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:01,354
Hey, Roz.

63
00:02:01,354 --> 00:02:02,155
Okay, here's
your directions,

64
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:03,656
hotel confirmation
and schedule.

65
00:02:03,656 --> 00:02:04,924
Excuse me?

66
00:02:04,924 --> 00:02:06,192
Broadcast conference.

67
00:02:06,192 --> 00:02:08,595
Good Lord, I thought
that was next week.

68
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:09,662
No, it's tonight.

69
00:02:09,662 --> 00:02:11,097
I'm going up
there right now.
Oh, no, Roz.

70
00:02:11,097 --> 00:02:13,099
I just got back from Boston,
for God's sakes.

71
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:15,668
You know, maybe I can
just drive up tomorrow

72
00:02:15,668 --> 00:02:16,636
and attend the panels.

73
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,171
Frasier,
tonight's reception's

74
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:19,105
the most
important part.

75
00:02:19,105 --> 00:02:21,174
It sets the tone for
the whole weekend.

76
00:02:21,174 --> 00:02:22,675
Oh, come on, last year,
everybody just got drunk

77
00:02:22,675 --> 00:02:24,444
and acted like a bunch
of horny teenagers.

78
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:27,647
Exactly, so stop yakking
and start packing.

79
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:31,017
Well, you know,
it could be

80
00:02:31,017 --> 00:02:32,519
just the boost you
need after a long week

81
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:35,355
with Lilith and
le Pretzel Boy.

82
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:38,124
You know, come to think
of it, there was

83
00:02:38,124 --> 00:02:40,059
one really gorgeous blonde
up there--

84
00:02:40,059 --> 00:02:43,963
"Rush Hour" Rita,
Laramie's eye in the sky.

85
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:45,398
Yeah, I remember her.

86
00:02:45,398 --> 00:02:48,334
The traffic was bumper-to-bumper
outside her room.

87
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:50,270
Meow, Roz.

88
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,137
It's just I
am so sick

89
00:02:51,137 --> 00:02:53,506
of men becoming panting idiots

90
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:55,808
just at the sight
of blonde hair.

91
00:02:55,808 --> 00:02:56,676
Oh, that's a bit of
an oversimplification.

92
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,178
That's ridiculous.
It's insulting, Roz.

93
00:02:58,678 --> 00:02:59,679
For God sakes,
I mean,

94
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,948
every man's taste
is different.

95
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:03,249
Sorry. It's just
that I met this guy
at Nervosa today

96
00:03:03,249 --> 00:03:05,552
for coffee, and it
was very annoying.

97
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:07,120
Every time I tried
to say anything,

98
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,322
this blonde waitress
would walk by.

99
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:10,089
Oh, Mimi's back?

100
00:03:10,089 --> 00:03:11,090
Oh, that's good news.

101
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:12,392
Got to stop in
to see Mimi.

102
00:03:12,392 --> 00:03:13,560
FRASIER:
You know what?

103
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,561
I guess I better get packing.

104
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:15,795
MARTIN:
What are you
talking about?

105
00:03:15,795 --> 00:03:17,564
You got your bags right there.

106
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:18,998
No, Dad.
These are my "daddy" clothes.

107
00:03:18,998 --> 00:03:24,003
I have to go and pack
my "Come to Daddy" clothes.

108
00:03:24,003 --> 00:03:24,938
DONNY:
Oh, give me a break.

109
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:26,372
All right, all right.

110
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:28,374
My surveillance guy
just canceled for tonight

111
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:30,376
just when I need him
for this big money divorce case.

112
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:31,377
Is this the Stanley
Redmond thing?

113
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:33,179
Yeah. The Dumpster
rental king.

114
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:34,013
This guy controls

115
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:35,815
half the Dumpsters
in the Northwest.

116
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:38,117
His wife thinks he's been taking
out the wrong kind of trash.

117
00:03:38,117 --> 00:03:40,553
Now, you know, if I can
prove it, this case is mine.

118
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:41,955
That is so depressing.

119
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:44,457
You expect this sort of behavior
from a mattress king,

120
00:03:44,457 --> 00:03:48,328
but we ask more
of our Dumpster royalty.

121
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:50,196
Yeah, but, uh,
you should see his girlfriend.

122
00:03:50,196 --> 00:03:52,098
She's gorgeous, leggy, blonde.

123
00:03:52,098 --> 00:03:55,068
Oh, well, blonde.
That explains it.

124
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,569
Good-bye.
I'm sorry.

125
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:57,470
DONNY:
Hey, wait a minute.

126
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:58,404
Marty, you were
a cop, right?

127
00:03:58,404 --> 00:03:59,906
You must have
done surveillance.

128
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:00,907
Oh, sure,
all the time.

129
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:01,908
Well, why don't you
work for me tonight?

130
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:02,875
It's 45 bucks
an hour.

131
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:04,344
Oh, I don't think
Dad would want to do that.

132
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:06,579
45 bucks?
DONNY:
All right, 50.

133
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:07,847
But if you get a picture
of Redmond and the girl,

134
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:09,215
there's a $500 bonus.

135
00:04:09,215 --> 00:04:10,416
500 dollars?

136
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,986
All right, $700.
You're killing me here.

137
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:14,254
Dad, I-I don't think
this is a good idea.

138
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,155
Where exactly is this stakeout?

139
00:04:16,155 --> 00:04:17,557
It's at
the Alcazar Apartments,

140
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:18,825
you know, in Belltown.

141
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:20,627
Belltown is, uh,
sort of a sketchy neighborhood,

142
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:21,494
wouldn't you say?

143
00:04:21,494 --> 00:04:22,862
Oh, Niles, to you,
a sketchy neighborhood

144
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:25,765
is when the cheese shop
doesn't have valet parking.

145
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:28,501
I'm an ex-cop, remember?

146
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:30,303
Yeah, yeah,
I know you're an ex-cop.

147
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:32,038
Let's just examine this, Dad...

148
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:32,972
No, no, no, no,
let's just forget about it.

149
00:04:32,972 --> 00:04:34,407
I'm not going to listen
to this all night.

150
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:35,308
I just won't do it.
Are you satisfied?

151
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:36,576
Yes.

152
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:37,644
Thank you.

153
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:39,412
Donny, I'm sorry
to put

154
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:40,179
a crimp in your plans.

155
00:04:40,179 --> 00:04:41,514
DONNY:
That's all right.

156
00:04:41,514 --> 00:04:42,715
I'll sure I'll find
somebody else.

157
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:45,685
You're still doing it,
right?

158
00:04:45,685 --> 00:04:47,687
Hell, yes.

159
00:04:51,157 --> 00:04:53,126
Thanks for watching Alice, Lori.

160
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,161
I really owe you one.

161
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:57,163
Well, I just want to get
down to this cocktail party

162
00:04:57,163 --> 00:04:59,666
before all the good men
are taken.

163
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:03,169
What? I just want to have
a little fun tonight.

164
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:06,172
No, I do not mean that.

165
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:09,108
All right, I do mean that.

166
00:05:09,108 --> 00:05:11,511
(knock on door)
Uh, Lori,
I'll talk to you later.

167
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:13,012
Thank you again. Bye-bye.

168
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,582
Oh, hey, Frasier.

169
00:05:16,582 --> 00:05:18,084
Hi, Roz. My room
isn't ready yet.

170
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:19,385
Can I put my stuff here
until I can check in?

171
00:05:19,385 --> 00:05:21,187
Sure. Come on in.
Thanks.

172
00:05:21,187 --> 00:05:22,722
I'll tell you, the
storm hasn't dampened

173
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:24,557
the festivities
downstairs.

174
00:05:24,557 --> 00:05:26,893
It's only 7:00,
and Marge Whitmeyer

175
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:29,696
is already in the bar
arm wrestling people for drinks.

176
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:30,997
How many did you buy her?

177
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:34,967
Well, three,
but my elbow was in a wet spot.

178
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:36,469
Hey, did you happen to notice
if that weather guy

179
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:37,937
from KSGY was there?

180
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:39,405
Yes, I noticed
that he was there.

181
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:40,340
Something tells me

182
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,808
the forecast calls
for a collision

183
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:44,677
between two warm fronts.

184
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,446
(phone ringing)

185
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:48,314
Oh, excuse me.

186
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:51,851
Hello?

187
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,119
Oh, yeah, he's here.

188
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:54,721
Front desk.

189
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:57,023
Great, thanks. Hello.

190
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,524
Yes.

191
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:02,295
Well, then, you'll
just have to get me
a room elsewhere.

192
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:04,564
I see.

193
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:07,066
Thank you very much.

194
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:10,370
They don't have a room for me.

195
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,506
What are you going to do?

196
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:18,344
Well... I guess I could stay
on the couch.

197
00:06:18,344 --> 00:06:19,245
What?

198
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:20,713
Oh, come on, Roz.
I got no choice.

199
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,081
The whole island
is booked.

200
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:23,916
Well, this sure is going
to cramp my style.

201
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:26,419
I mean, it's not like college
when everybody just...

202
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:29,288
Never mind.

203
00:06:29,288 --> 00:06:31,190
You know, Roz,
we're two attractive people.

204
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,693
We're at a conference that turns
into a bacchanal every year.

205
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:36,095
Odds are, neither of us
will need this room tonight.

206
00:06:36,095 --> 00:06:38,831
You're right.
What's the problem?

207
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:41,501
I believe there's
a cocktail party awaiting us.

208
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:43,269
Let's go down together.

209
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:44,771
We'll be like jackals.

210
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:46,272
They hunt in pairs.

211
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:48,107
I like your
self-assurance.

212
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:49,442
There's no greater
aphrodisiac

213
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:50,777
than confidence.
Shall we?

214
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:53,613
Let the games begin.

215
00:06:56,115 --> 00:06:57,617
I just need
a little more lipstick.

216
00:06:57,617 --> 00:07:00,119
I'm sweating
right through this shirt.

217
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:24,010
Niles...

218
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:25,511
You specifically
promised me...

219
00:07:25,511 --> 00:07:27,346
Oh, would you shut up
and get in here?

220
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:31,651
How did you know
I was here?

221
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:32,685
The doorman.

222
00:07:32,685 --> 00:07:34,153
Big mouth.

223
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:35,588
Oh, well,
I guess he didn't realize

224
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:37,089
he was being sworn to secrecy
when you said,

225
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:40,359
"Hey, Sid,
I'm going on a stakeout."

226
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:44,697
I can't believe you lied to me.

227
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:46,065
Well, I'm sorry,
but you were making

228
00:07:46,065 --> 00:07:47,567
such a big fuss about nothing.

229
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:49,068
It is not nothing.

230
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:50,069
Look at this
neighborhood.

231
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:52,071
I'm not even
happy parking my
Mercedes here.

232
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:53,573
It's not that bad.

233
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:54,540
Oh, really?

234
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:57,043
Well, then, could
you explain to me

235
00:07:57,043 --> 00:07:58,044
the ominous
group of men

236
00:07:58,044 --> 00:08:00,046
standing back there in
the shadows by my car?

237
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:01,047
They're all wearing

238
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:02,048
the same sort
of dark coat.

239
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:03,449
It's some
sort of gang.

240
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:06,853
Niles, they're Hasidic Jews.

241
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:11,357
That's right.
Keep walking, keep walking.

242
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:16,395
So, what, did you come
down here to bawl me out?

243
00:08:16,395 --> 00:08:18,331
Yes... partly.

244
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:19,232
(sirens blaring
in the distance)

245
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:20,733
Also to give
you this.

246
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:21,734
What's this?

247
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:23,603
Clam chowder.

248
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:25,404
(laughing)

249
00:08:25,404 --> 00:08:26,405
I remembered Mom
made it for you

250
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:27,406
when you went
ice fishing,

251
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:28,908
and I hated the
thought of you

252
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:30,910
sitting out here
cold and hungry.

253
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:32,745
Well, thank you.
I appreciate it.

254
00:08:32,745 --> 00:08:34,580
But, look, why don't
you just go back home?

255
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:35,548
I'll be fine.

256
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:36,482
No, I can stay
for a while.

257
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:37,483
No, really.
I'll be fine.

258
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:39,385
No, no, you can
use the company.
Oh, come on, Niles,

259
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:41,787
why don't you tell me
what's really on your mind?

260
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:44,557
All right, Dad.
I was worried about you.

261
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:45,825
I knew it.
Because I'm an old man

262
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:48,160
and I can't take care of myself.

263
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,098
No. Age has nothing
to do with it.

264
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:53,599
I've always
worried about you.

265
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:56,102
That's what it's like
when your father's a cop.

266
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:58,571
I worried about
you when I was
five years old.

267
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:00,306
I didn't stop
worrying

268
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:01,574
until the day you retired,

269
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:04,477
and today just brought
it all back again.

270
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:07,346
Look, I'm sorry.

271
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:11,017
For what it's worth,
I know what you mean.

272
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:12,852
My dad was a cop, too.

273
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:14,220
I know.

274
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,054
But you know, Niles,

275
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:16,422
I'm not chasing after bad guys.

276
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:18,357
I'm just going
to take a picture.

277
00:09:18,357 --> 00:09:19,792
That's true.

278
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:23,296
I'm... probably overreacting
like usual.

279
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:25,798
Uh... well,
I guess I'll head home.

280
00:09:25,798 --> 00:09:27,300
No, no. Hey, hey.

281
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,802
Wait a little bit.
Stick around.

282
00:09:29,802 --> 00:09:32,071
How would you like
a little clam chowder?

283
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,773
I'd love some.
Okay.

284
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:37,610
This is clam chowder!

285
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:38,911
Well, what did you expect?

286
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:42,014
Irish whiskey!

287
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:43,282
Your mother

288
00:09:43,282 --> 00:09:45,284
always filled it
with coffee and Irish whiskey.

289
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:48,020
We just called it clam chowder
in front of you kids.

290
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,827
Is that why you got so mad

291
00:09:54,827 --> 00:09:58,130
that day I crumbled
oyster crackers in your thermos?

292
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:06,739
(sighs):
What happened to you?

293
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:08,040
The same thing that
happened to you.

294
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,310
I got a hug good night.

295
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:12,612
Where did we go wrong?

296
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:16,349
Rush Hour Rita was draping
herself all over you.

297
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:17,817
And that news guy
actually said to me

298
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:20,786
if I gave him 22 minutes,
he'd give me the world.

299
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:25,758
I, uh... I
don't know, Roz.

300
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:27,727
After he gave you
the brush-off,

301
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:30,763
he came over and sat down
next to me and Rita.

302
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:32,264
Before I knew it,
they had discovered

303
00:10:32,264 --> 00:10:36,268
their mutual fondness
for tango music.

304
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:38,671
ROZ:
Oh...

305
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:41,040
I lose out to tango music?

306
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,376
What a night. A total bust.

307
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:44,710
Oh, come on, Roz.

308
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:45,711
You know,
for my money,

309
00:10:45,711 --> 00:10:48,214
you were the most
attractive woman
down there.

310
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:49,715
Thanks, Frasier.

311
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:51,217
And I'm not
just saying this

312
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:52,184
to return the favor,

313
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:54,520
but you look really hot
in that beard.

314
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,423
Oh, well... thanks.

315
00:10:57,423 --> 00:10:58,924
Well, you know,
maybe we're better off.

316
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:02,795
Just a couple of old friends
having a cozy evening together.

317
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:03,629
Yeah, right.

318
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:04,630
(knock on door)

319
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:05,631
It's him!
It's her!

320
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:07,133
All right.
All right.

321
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,803
Come in.
Hello.

322
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:11,604
Oh.

323
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:12,905
Sorry to
disturb you,

324
00:11:12,905 --> 00:11:14,707
but the manager wanted
to apologize

325
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:17,043
for the mix-up with the room.

326
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:18,310
This is on us.

327
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:19,845
That's nice.

328
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:21,347
Well, uh,
you in the mood

329
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,848
for a glass
of champers, Roz?

330
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:23,783
I don't know.
What do you think?

331
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:26,152
It won't fit in the mini-bar.

332
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:27,586
Well, it's settled, then.

333
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:29,588
Uh, I can open it myself.

334
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:30,589
Thanks. Here you are.

335
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:31,590
Thank you.

336
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:34,593
Well...

337
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:38,097
Ah, demi-sec,
respectable label.

338
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:39,932
Not a bad year.

339
00:11:39,932 --> 00:11:41,767
We may just be
having a better time

340
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:43,769
than anybody else here.

341
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:47,039
(tango music playing upstairs)

342
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:59,719
(shouting):
Dad, this thing
is amazing!

343
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:04,023
I can actually hear some guy
brushing his teeth.

344
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:07,860
Swish, swish, spit.

345
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:12,531
Swish, swish...

346
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:14,500
(gasps):
Flossing!

347
00:12:15,534 --> 00:12:16,969
Niles!

348
00:12:16,969 --> 00:12:19,438
You have...
got to try this.

349
00:12:19,438 --> 00:12:20,940
It's incredible!
Here, put those on.

350
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,942
All right.

351
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:24,877
All right, now point
that anywhere you want.

352
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:25,845
(horn honking)

353
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:28,214
(screams)

354
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:33,452
Niles, will you quit
kidding around?!

355
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:35,454
This isn't a game.
It's a job.

356
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:36,455
I just want
to spot the guy,

357
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:38,257
get a picture
and get out of here,

358
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:41,560
so why don't we just sit here
and be quiet for a while?

359
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:49,068
You know, Dad...

360
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:50,836
are you sure you want
to be doing this?

361
00:12:50,836 --> 00:12:54,006
I thought you said
you weren't worried about me.

362
00:12:54,006 --> 00:12:54,874
No-no, I'm not worried
about your safety.

363
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:57,343
I just mean, are you doing
the right thing,

364
00:12:57,343 --> 00:12:59,545
meddling in this
guy's marriage?

365
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:01,247
You know, speaking
as a psychiatrist...

366
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:04,116
Oh, boy, open up a window.

367
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:06,519
I just see this
sort of thing

368
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:08,020
in my practice
all the time.

369
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,889
People make mistakes
an-and have affairs

370
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:12,625
and then find
some way to fix it.

371
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,460
It's possible that by
taking this picture,

372
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,829
you're destroying any
chance this man has.

373
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:18,197
Niles, the guy's a bum.

374
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:20,032
He's probably always been a bum.

375
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:21,867
Now, if you want to get
into a debate about something,

376
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:23,836
maybe you can tell me
what those grass clippings

377
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:25,638
were doing in the clam chowder.

378
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:28,941
That was lemongrass...

379
00:13:28,941 --> 00:13:32,845
and Chef Andre has gotten
high kudos for that soup.

380
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:34,747
Well, if kudos are
those brown chewy things,

381
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:35,748
he can have them.

382
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:36,649
I put mine in the ashtray.

383
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:43,088
You pretend to
be such a cynic.

384
00:13:43,088 --> 00:13:44,557
I think you
agree with me.

385
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:46,592
You have too much of
a conscience not to.

386
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:49,094
Aw, babbity babbity bap.

387
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:51,230
Oh, there they are.

388
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:52,731
You're still going
to take this picture?

389
00:13:52,731 --> 00:13:54,733
Oh, you're damn right
I am.

390
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:56,735
Even though right now,
that man may be planning

391
00:13:56,735 --> 00:13:58,604
to break it off with
his girlfriend tonight,

392
00:13:58,604 --> 00:14:01,307
planning to-to rededicate
himself to his marriage,

393
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:03,542
the terrible guilt
spurring him on

394
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:04,476
to ever-greater depths
of commitment,

395
00:14:04,476 --> 00:14:05,978
an-and-and years from now,

396
00:14:05,978 --> 00:14:08,981
he may be sitting with his wife
by the fire, holding her hand,

397
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:11,884
reflecting on all their
wonderful years together--

398
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:13,319
especially their
sunset years--

399
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:16,322
and you could
destroy all of that

400
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:18,824
with one click
of a camera.

401
00:14:18,824 --> 00:14:21,327
(shutter clicking rapidly)

402
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:24,597
Sorry, Niles.
What were you saying?

403
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:27,366
You took a picture
of that tree,

404
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,134
and you know it.
All right, I did.

405
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:31,403
What'd you have to talk
about all that stuff for?

406
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:33,272
I was just saying
what you were
already thinking.

407
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:35,574
You did the right thing and
you're not going to regret it.

408
00:14:35,574 --> 00:14:37,042
Oh, yeah? Well,
how am I going to tell Donny

409
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,944
I just sat here and watched them
walk by and get in the car?

410
00:14:38,944 --> 00:14:39,845
You'll tell
him proudly

411
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:41,347
because you know
in your hearts...

412
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:43,349
(crash)
(car alarm blaring)

413
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:45,851
Whoa! They backed
into your Mercedes.

414
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:49,221
I don't believe it.

415
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:50,556
They're not even leaving a note.

416
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,524
They're driving away.

417
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:53,492
Well, I wouldn't worry
about it, Niles.

418
00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:54,927
They're probably wracked
with grief,

419
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:56,428
and it'll spur them on to...

420
00:14:56,428 --> 00:14:58,264
Oh, shut up
and take that picture.

421
00:14:58,264 --> 00:14:59,164
Hurry up, get
their license
plate number!

422
00:14:59,164 --> 00:15:01,667
Hurry! Hurry!

423
00:15:04,603 --> 00:15:07,539
Um... my longest relationship

424
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:10,609
would have to be Ted--
'88 to '90.

425
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:13,612
No, Derrick--
'89 to '92.

426
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:17,383
Being a gentleman, Roz,
I won't point out

427
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:19,885
the slight overlap there.

428
00:15:19,885 --> 00:15:22,388
It's not an overlap.
It's a transition.

429
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:23,889
Uh-huh.
You know, like in April,

430
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:25,891
when you start wearing
your spring clothes

431
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:27,860
even though you're still
wearing your winter stuff?

432
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:28,827
Yeah, well, if we're talking
April of '90,

433
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:30,796
I doubt if you were wearing
much of anything at all.

434
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,766
Okay, wise guy...

435
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,768
what was your
longest relationship?

436
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:38,771
Oh, that's
easy-- Lilith.

437
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:39,772
Lilith.

438
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:40,773
Although...

439
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,675
(chuckling)

440
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:44,076
What?

441
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:44,944
Well...

442
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,812
if we're not talking
romantic relationship,

443
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:48,814
well, then, uh...

444
00:15:48,814 --> 00:15:51,817
my longest relationship
with a woman would be you.

445
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:53,752
Seven years.

446
00:15:53,752 --> 00:15:54,620
Loser.

447
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,156
(laughing)

448
00:15:57,156 --> 00:15:58,157
Yeah.

449
00:15:58,157 --> 00:15:59,658
Seven years...

450
00:15:59,658 --> 00:16:02,161
Gosh.
My God,
it has been that long.

451
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:03,629
It's worth toasting.

452
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:04,663
Absolutely.

453
00:16:04,663 --> 00:16:06,065
(chuckles)

454
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:09,935
So, Frasier,
what's with the beard?

455
00:16:10,936 --> 00:16:12,271
You hate it.

456
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:13,572
No. Actually, I like it.

457
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:16,008
It's like you're Frasier,
but you're not Frasier.

458
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:17,977
What made you do it?

459
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,845
Oh, I don't know,
you know, I just...

460
00:16:19,845 --> 00:16:21,714
wanted to change things a little
or something--

461
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:23,515
I don't know-- be spontaneous.

462
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:25,250
Oh, my God, I almost did
something like that

463
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,719
this weekend.
FRASIER:
Really?

464
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:28,187
Yeah, I...

465
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:30,189
Oh, hell,
I'll show you.

466
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:32,691
Ooh, nice silk pajamas.

467
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:34,193
I made a little
purchase

468
00:16:34,193 --> 00:16:35,594
on my way up here.
Did you?

469
00:16:35,594 --> 00:16:37,963
Well, I am just dying
with anticipation.

470
00:16:37,963 --> 00:16:38,964
What is it?

471
00:16:38,964 --> 00:16:39,965
ROZ:
But you promise
you won't laugh?

472
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:41,233
I promise.

473
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:43,535
ROZ:
Okay. Hold on one second.

474
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:45,838
I'll be right out.

475
00:16:54,913 --> 00:16:55,814
(sighs)

476
00:16:55,814 --> 00:16:57,816
I just wanted to see
for once in my life

477
00:16:57,816 --> 00:16:59,618
what it'd be like
to be a blonde.

478
00:16:59,618 --> 00:17:02,421
I thought I'd wear
it down to the
bar one night.

479
00:17:02,921 --> 00:17:04,390
(chuckling)

480
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:06,825
Pretty pathetic, huh?

481
00:17:06,825 --> 00:17:11,630
On the contrary, Roz,
it's-it's... quite becoming.

482
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:14,700
It's like you're...

483
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,970
Roz but not Roz.

484
00:17:19,905 --> 00:17:23,809
Hello, stranger.

485
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:25,811
You here for
the conference?

486
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:27,212
Yes, I am.

487
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:29,548
Is this seat taken?

488
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:32,818
It's been waiting for you
all its life.

489
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:36,155
Champagne?

490
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:38,624
Well, I'm not
sure I should.

491
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:41,860
I already had one glass,
and it went straight to my head.

492
00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:45,264
I feel like maybe
I should lie down.

493
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:47,166
You could use
my room.

494
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:50,102
Are you sure you're a gentleman?

495
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:53,472
Well, I do prefer blondes.

496
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:55,874
(both laughing)

497
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:57,376
God, how many times

498
00:17:57,376 --> 00:17:58,877
have I had that
conversation?

499
00:17:58,877 --> 00:18:01,747
(both chuckling)

500
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:02,614
What would life be

501
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:05,551
without the occasional
surrender to impulse?

502
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:08,353
It's true.
It does make you feel alive.

503
00:18:08,353 --> 00:18:11,290
Doing things you know
you shouldn't do.

504
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:14,226
With people you
shouldn't be with.

505
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,663
Right.

506
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:22,701
Right.

507
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:28,540
You know, suddenly...

508
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:32,044
this couch seems
a little small for me.

509
00:18:33,011 --> 00:18:35,914
Well, the bed seems pretty big.

510
00:18:35,914 --> 00:18:38,851
It's a big bed.

511
00:18:41,987 --> 00:18:44,323
It is.

512
00:18:50,762 --> 00:18:53,265
Roz...

513
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:55,000
(knocking at door)

514
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,302
For God's sake.

515
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:02,441
Are you all right?

516
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:03,375
Yeah.
FRASIER:
Okay. All right.

517
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:05,244
Hello...

518
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:06,245
Kenny?

519
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:07,546
I got stuck
in the storm.

520
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:09,381
Now they don't have
a room for me.

521
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:10,716
I hear we're in the
same boat, huh, Doc?

522
00:19:10,716 --> 00:19:12,184
Oh, hey, Roz.

523
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:13,585
Hey.
Hey, cool wig.

524
00:19:13,585 --> 00:19:15,354
Thanks.

525
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:17,189
KENNY:
Hey, wait a minute.

526
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:20,425
I'm not interrupting anything,
am I?

527
00:19:20,425 --> 00:19:21,226
(laughing)

528
00:19:21,226 --> 00:19:23,695
Pajamas,
champagne...
No...

529
00:19:23,695 --> 00:19:25,564
a fire.

530
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:27,299
(laughing)

531
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:30,969
So, uh, anyhow, uh,
can I bunk here?

532
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:31,703
Why not?

533
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:32,571
No reason, yeah.

534
00:19:32,571 --> 00:19:33,572
Great, great.

535
00:19:33,572 --> 00:19:36,041
Yeah, I really like
that blond hair, Roz.

536
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:37,576
You'd better be careful,
though.

537
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:39,578
Get the doc here all
hot and bothered.

538
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:41,313
(laughing)

539
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:44,516
Well...

540
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,385
I'm just going to get
out of these wet clothes.

541
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:48,854
I had a heck of a
time getting here.

542
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:51,790
All these roads
look the same.

543
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:55,527
I ended up taking
a wrong turn.

544
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:56,828
The last thing you
want to do out here

545
00:19:56,828 --> 00:20:00,332
in these woods is
take a wrong turn.

546
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:05,103
Quite right, Kenny.

547
00:20:09,107 --> 00:20:10,442
You know...

548
00:20:10,442 --> 00:20:12,811
I'm not sure
the beard's really working.

549
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:15,614
I... probably should
shave it off.

550
00:20:15,614 --> 00:20:17,816
I wasn't going to say anything,
but, yeah.

551
00:20:17,816 --> 00:20:19,017
Yeah.

552
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:22,821
(sighs)

553
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:27,326
I don't wear one of
these snore strips,

554
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:30,229
I'm a buzz saw going
through steel pipe.

555
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,897
So, uh...

556
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,232
Rock-Paper-Scissors
for the sofa?

557
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,234
I'll take it.
Okay.

558
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,736
Looks like it's you and me
in the bed, Doc...

559
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:39,238
Okay.

560
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:43,742
But I warn you,
I'm a roller.

561
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:48,747
What was I thinking

562
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:50,249
drinking all that coffee
on the way up here?

563
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,750
I'm going to be up
all night.

564
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:55,254
I am wired.

565
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,258
Uh, Kenny, do you
think you could...

566
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:02,227
(snoring)

567
00:21:04,129 --> 00:21:06,465
Good night, Frasier.

568
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:08,267
Good night, Roz.

569
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,102
