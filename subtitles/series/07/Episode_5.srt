1
00:00:07,974 --> 00:00:11,244
And we'll be right back
after this short news break.

2
00:00:11,244 --> 00:00:12,345
Frasier...
Hmm?

3
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:14,280
I'm here to give you
an advance tip.

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,248
Really?
Hey, Gil.

5
00:00:15,248 --> 00:00:16,716
Roz. I'm about
to review

6
00:00:16,716 --> 00:00:18,184
a divine new
Italian trattoria

7
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:20,186
I've discovered
called Bella, Bella.

8
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:21,988
Uh-huh.
I'm alerting you now

9
00:00:21,988 --> 00:00:23,223
because once I review it,

10
00:00:23,223 --> 00:00:25,291
reservations will be
impossible to come by.

11
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:26,259
Oh, well, thank
you, Gil.

12
00:00:26,259 --> 00:00:27,127
It's always gratifying

13
00:00:27,127 --> 00:00:29,629
to be a few minutes
ahead of a trend.

14
00:00:29,629 --> 00:00:32,032
They make an osso buco
that's so divine

15
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:35,335
I call it
the veal shank redemption.

16
00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:37,904
Hey, guys.
Oh, Kenny.

17
00:00:37,904 --> 00:00:39,906
Show's going great,
Frasier.

18
00:00:39,906 --> 00:00:41,875
Only one thing missing,
of course.

19
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:42,876
I know, I know.

20
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:44,377
A new theme song.

21
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:46,312
I'm sorry, I just haven't
gotten around to it yet.

22
00:00:46,312 --> 00:00:48,214
Mrs. Delafield's been
hounding me on this.

23
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:50,216
She really thinks each show
having a theme song

24
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:52,218
will help hook the listeners.

25
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:53,186
Gil's got his.

26
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,688
My first choice was
"Food, Glorious Food"

27
00:00:55,688 --> 00:00:57,090
from the show Oliver!

28
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:58,391
Ooh, that's a perfect match.

29
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:01,795
Haute cuisine and a chorus
of starving orphans.

30
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:03,630
But then, a composer friend
of mine

31
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,632
came up with this little ditty
for me.

32
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:08,134
♪ Whether choosing a wine ♪

33
00:01:08,134 --> 00:01:09,636
♪ Or the best place to dine ♪

34
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,638
♪ It's all a matter of taste ♪

35
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:12,906
♪ Yes, sir ♪

36
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:15,909
♪ It's all a matter of taste ♪

37
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:18,211
Great, huh?

38
00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:19,145
And the nicest thing is

39
00:01:19,145 --> 00:01:20,947
he didn't take a penny for it.

40
00:01:20,947 --> 00:01:23,817
Well, at least he
has a conscience.

41
00:01:27,053 --> 00:01:28,354
You know, Kenny,

42
00:01:28,354 --> 00:01:30,824
I'm sorry for procrastinating
on this thing.

43
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:33,259
I tell you, I'll get one
as soon as I possibly can.

44
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:34,227
Well, you better

45
00:01:34,227 --> 00:01:35,662
come up with
something here.

46
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:37,564
I'm sorry
to be a hard-ass--

47
00:01:37,564 --> 00:01:39,432
it's the part of my job
I hate the most--

48
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:42,936
but I need this thing
on my desk, Monday-ish.

49
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:44,938
You know.

50
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:47,941
You know, Roz...

51
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,943
hearing Gil's little
ditty puts me in mind

52
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:52,846
that maybe we should just
do an original song.

53
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:55,215
My new boyfriend, Leon,
is in a band.

54
00:01:55,215 --> 00:01:56,716
He could write one for you.

55
00:01:56,716 --> 00:01:58,718
Actually, I was thinking
of composing it myself.

56
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:00,120
I'm not without musical ability,
you know.

57
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,856
Could you at least hire Leon
to accompany you?

58
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:04,791
I take it he's
desperate for work.

59
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,292
Hasn't had a gig
in months.

60
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:07,794
Music is all he knows.

61
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:09,562
He's not good
at anything else--

62
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:10,330
except in bed.

63
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,599
That's what he does best.
Yes.

64
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:13,833
How long did it take you
to find that out?

65
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:14,834
Ten seconds,
Frasier.

66
00:02:14,834 --> 00:02:16,836
Oh, longer than usual.

67
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:23,476
Frasier.
Oh, Niles.

68
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:24,811
Oh, dear.

69
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,613
We had dinner plans tonight,
didn't we?

70
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:27,614
Yes. Don't tell me
you're canceling.

71
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:29,115
Well, I have to.

72
00:02:29,115 --> 00:02:30,583
I have a little project
this evening.

73
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:32,585
Oh. Does this have to do
with the new theme song

74
00:02:32,585 --> 00:02:34,087
you promised your listeners?

75
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:34,921
As a matter of fact,
it does.

76
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:36,222
I've got to have
something by Monday,

77
00:02:36,222 --> 00:02:37,223
and I thought
I'd take advantage

78
00:02:37,223 --> 00:02:38,224
of a nice, quiet
evening at home.

79
00:02:38,224 --> 00:02:42,228
(vacuum cleaner whirring)

80
00:02:42,228 --> 00:02:44,731
Oh...

81
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:46,032
Daphne!

82
00:02:46,032 --> 00:02:46,833
Daphne,
would you please

83
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:48,568
turn off that
vacuum cleaner?

84
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:51,871
It's not a vacuum cleaner.

85
00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:56,142
It's the Dirt Scourge 2000,
a total cleansing system.

86
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,411
Is it new?

87
00:02:58,411 --> 00:02:59,846
Yeah. Got it this afternoon.

88
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:02,348
You see, this water traps
all the dirt particles

89
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:04,350
instead of recycling
them back into the air.

90
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,319
I got all that just
from Dr. Crane's pillow.

91
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,255
Ew.

92
00:03:09,255 --> 00:03:11,791
I've been begging
you to switch

93
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:13,626
to a more
abrasive loofah.

94
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:18,364
No, it would be the
same for anyone.

95
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:19,866
Dead skin, dust mites...

96
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:20,867
That's what we're
all sleeping on

97
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:22,168
only we don't know it.

98
00:03:22,168 --> 00:03:25,338
We do now. Jeez.

99
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:27,707
This is the chance
I've been waiting for.

100
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:30,643
(vacuum cleaner whirring)

101
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:35,882
(water bubbling)

102
00:03:46,926 --> 00:03:49,429
Well, apparently,
the Dirt Scourge 2000

103
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:53,266
is no match for
the dirt pile 1957.

104
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:54,567
Well, this is going back.

105
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:57,971
On the commercial, they clean
all the mud off a hippopotamus.

106
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:01,507
Well, at least now
I can get down to work.

107
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:03,009
You know, Niles,
I'm sorry again about dinner,

108
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:04,277
but can I buy you a sherry?

109
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:05,578
Oh, thank you.

110
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:08,081
About this theme song
of yours...

111
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,450
why don't you just
use a standard?

112
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,285
Actually, I want
to compose one myself.

113
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:13,786
You see, I've always had
an affinity for music

114
00:04:13,786 --> 00:04:15,121
and I've often
wondered

115
00:04:15,121 --> 00:04:16,422
what I might achieve

116
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:19,325
if I just rolled up my sleeves
and gave it a try.

117
00:04:19,325 --> 00:04:21,728
Didn't you write some kind of
musical back in prep school?

118
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:23,229
Yes, I did, Dad.
Niles was in it.

119
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:24,230
You know, the whole
school came out

120
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,198
humming my
opening anthem.

121
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:26,199
They went in humming it.

122
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:27,667
It was Beethoven's
Ninth Symphony note for note.

123
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:28,601
It was not.

124
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,069
It absolutely was.
It was not at all.

125
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:32,505

Well, all right,
all right, all right.

128
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:37,543
Well, I suppose I may have
borrowed a note or two

129
00:04:37,543 --> 00:04:38,878
as a launching pad.

130

I'm sorry I'm just teasing.

135
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,422
Actually, it was
a wonderful show.

136
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:51,357
I was very proud
to be acting in it.

137
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:52,792
And you know, Niles,
you were wonderful
in it as well.

138
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,794
Well, thank you.
I thought so.

139
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:56,262
I often thought
if I'd kept at it,

140
00:04:56,262 --> 00:04:58,264
I could have been
a professional actor.

141
00:04:58,264 --> 00:04:59,132
Ah, you see?

142
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,967
We all have a road not taken,

143
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:03,703
some unfinished business
worth exploring.

144
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:05,505
Yeah, I always wanted
to be a toe dancer,

145
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:08,007
but a bullet ended my dream.

146
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:15,548
Well, Frasier, if you
need any help with this,

147
00:05:15,548 --> 00:05:16,549
I'm right here.

148
00:05:16,549 --> 00:05:18,051
Thank you, Niles.

149
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:19,052
I'd rather handle
the composing chores myself,

150
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:21,354
but I could use
a sounding board.

151
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:23,589
Fair enough. Let's put
our heads together.

152
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:24,991
Figuratively speaking,
of course.

153
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,326
I saw what came out
of your pillow.

154
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:35,068
(piano plays simple notes)

155
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:36,502
I think
this new bridge

156
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:38,404
is the best thing
you've written.

157
00:05:38,404 --> 00:05:40,206
Really?
Oh, absolutely.

158
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:42,742

00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:49,749
You know, it does
have a Cole Portery,

163
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:51,250
Stephen Sondheimy
flavor, doesn't it?

164
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,618
Absolutely. Yes.

165
00:05:52,618 --> 00:05:54,520
Sondheimy would
have killed to
have written this.

166
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,022
(chuckles)

167
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,523
You know what?
I'm a little nervous.

168
00:05:57,523 --> 00:06:01,294
It just may be a bit
too conventional.

169
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:03,062
Perhaps instead
of a regular bridge

170
00:06:03,062 --> 00:06:07,066
I could substitute it
with a dramatic monologue

171
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:10,970
spoken against
a musical background.

172
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:13,740
I like it.

173
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:17,043
Of course, I would
have to hire an actor.

174
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:19,078
Yes, I suppose you could
squander a lot of money

175
00:06:19,078 --> 00:06:20,913
on some so-called
professional.

176
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:24,250
Someone who doesn't know
a thing about psychiatry.

177
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:28,020
Who doesn't understand
the whole gestalt.

178
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,655
Well, maybe you could do it.

179
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:30,390
I think so.

180
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,758
(laughs)

181
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:33,292
Oh, gosh, Niles.

182
00:06:33,292 --> 00:06:34,293
I will write you a speech

183
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:36,796
that will challenge your
entire histrionic range.

184
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:38,264
This is so exciting.

185
00:06:38,264 --> 00:06:39,265
Let's play the chorus again.

186
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:40,767
MARTIN:
Hey, Fras.

187
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:42,769
I just got an idea
for your little jingle.

188
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:45,238
Came to me while I
was brushing my teeth.

189
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:47,740
♪ What's new? I'm listenin' ♪

190
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,275
♪ Feelin' blue? I'm listenin' ♪

191
00:06:49,275 --> 00:06:51,210
'Cause that's what
you say on your show.

192
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:53,980
♪ Feelin' sad,
feelin' mad, feelin' glad ♪

193
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,516
♪ Feelin' bad? I'm listenin'. ♪

194
00:06:57,283 --> 00:06:59,085
Bravo.

195
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,853
That's wonderful.
Well, thanks.

196
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:03,256
You know, it's catchy--
that's what counts in a jingle.

197
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,624
That's very, very nice, Dad.

198
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:05,591
It's just that, well, you know,

199
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,627
I did promise my listeners
that I'd compose this myself.

200
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:09,061
It's no fair cheating.

201
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:10,496
Well, it's not cheating
technically.

202
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:11,998
Yes, very good,
very good, Dad,
but thank you

203
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:12,999
Off you go.

204
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:14,500
Okay, all right.

205
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:17,370
Hey, um...

206
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:19,772
Frasier, are you sure
you want to modulate here?

207
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:21,207
That may just complicate things.

208
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:23,176
Perhaps.

209
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:25,144
You know, I'm just trying
to make it interesting.

210
00:07:25,144 --> 00:07:28,080
To my ear, there's still
something lacking--

211
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,016
some tiny ingredient
that's missing.

212
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:32,084
I'm not sure what.

213
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:35,087
(musicians tuning instruments)

214
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:36,355
(tapping)

215
00:07:36,355 --> 00:07:38,624
All right, everyone.

216
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:39,959
Let's try this again.

217
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,294
We still have a few minutes

218
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,296
before the choir gets here.

219
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:51,804
Well, finally, the choir
has deigned to join us.

220
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:53,139
Sorry. Our bus broke down.

221
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,640
We had to walk two miles
to get here.

222
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,108
Ah, well, then
I suppose we can

223
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:57,577
dispense
with the breathing exercises

224
00:07:57,577 --> 00:07:58,878
I was going to recommend.

225
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:00,246
Please, if you would?

226
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:02,081
Off you go.

227
00:08:02,081 --> 00:08:05,952
Frasier, did you mean
to cut paragraph five
of my monologue?

228
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:07,753
Gosh, I might have, Niles.

229
00:08:07,753 --> 00:08:08,521
I've just been so busy.

230
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:09,856
What was the gist?

231
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:12,758
A lighthearted lampoon of
mental health care abuse.

232
00:08:12,758 --> 00:08:13,726
Ah. Yes, I did.

233
00:08:13,726 --> 00:08:15,728
I was afraid
that some fussbudget

234
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:18,231
might take offense
at my jape about lobotomies.

235
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:20,233
Well, I suppose it's
best to play it safe.

236
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:22,735
Although I did like
the way you indicated

237
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:24,537
manic depression
with the slide whistle.

238
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:26,305
(chuckles)

239
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,676
Do we really have to
use so many musicians?

240
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:32,245
For the sound I want, yes.

241
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:34,480
Whatever happened
to the concept
of "less is more"?

242
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,848
Ah, but if less is more,

243
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:38,317
then just think how much more
more will be.

244
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,087
You may be seated.

245
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:42,421
Ladies and gentlemen,

246
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:44,724
if I may have
your attention, please.

247
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:49,161
I'd like to take a few minutes
to explain my artistic vision.

248
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:50,563
Take as long as you want--

249
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:52,331
we're all on the clock.

250
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:53,599
Point well-taken.

251
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:55,001
Moving right along, then.

252
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:56,435
Frasier, I'm sorry we're late.

253
00:08:56,435 --> 00:08:57,937
We got stuck in traffic.

254
00:08:57,937 --> 00:08:58,938
Some stupid bus broke down.

255
00:08:58,938 --> 00:09:01,240
This is Leon.

256
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,075
Ah. Hello, Leon.
Hey, Dr. Crane.

257
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:03,943
Lovely to meet you.

258
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:05,278
Listen, why don't
you help yourself

259
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:06,779
to the refreshment
table there.

260
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:08,281
I've got to have a
few words with Roz.

261
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:09,715
Roz, we've
got a problem.

262
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:12,084
In scoring this, I had
to eliminate the guitar part.

263
00:09:12,084 --> 00:09:13,953
Well, put it back.
Well, I can't.

264
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:15,354
I'm afraid another instrument

265
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:17,356
might make things
sound cluttered.

266
00:09:17,356 --> 00:09:19,625
Unless, of course,
Leon can play the bagpipe.

267
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:22,295
Bagpipe?
Yes.

268
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:24,664
Our show deals with the whole
range of human emotion,

269
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:25,665
from euphoria to despair,

270
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:28,167
and nothing says despair
so quickly

271
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:30,970
as the skirl of a bagpipe.

272
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:33,339
Nothing says "turn off
the radio" so quickly, either.

273
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:35,174
Isn't there something else
he can play?

274
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:38,010
Well, I... yes. Yes.

275
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,445
Actually, our triangle
player called in

276
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:40,947
with a touch
of tinnitus.

277
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:42,381
Here we are.

278
00:09:42,381 --> 00:09:44,283
Leon, I have some good news
for you.

279
00:09:44,283 --> 00:09:45,785
I had to eliminate
the guitar part,

280
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:48,120
but I'm promoting you
to first triangle.

281
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,922
I-I've never played
one of these.

282
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,924
It looks tricky.

283
00:09:53,826 --> 00:09:55,561
I'll work with him.

284
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:57,897
Off you go.

285
00:09:57,897 --> 00:10:00,900
Well, then, now, people,
um, before we start,

286
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:04,403
I was wondering, uh,
are there any questions?

287
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:05,738
Yes, Viola.

288
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:06,973
My name is Tiffany.

289
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:09,408
No, no, no. I'm calling you
by your instrument name

290
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:11,210
so as to avoid confusion.

291
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:14,480
Oh, well, I have a question
about measure 34.

292
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,350
Aha. I thought you might.

293
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,851
Yes, you see, I've accelerated
the tempo there

294
00:10:18,851 --> 00:10:23,789
in order to depict the yearning
of the superego.

295
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:27,727
Very perceptive of you
to spot that.

296
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:30,997
No, I meant, are these
eighth notes or what?

297
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:34,734
Yes, eighth notes.

298
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:36,669
Anyone else?

299
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:37,970
Yes, Timpani?

300
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,705
You just answered my question.

301
00:10:39,705 --> 00:10:42,008
Not Tiffany. Timpani.

302
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:43,509
What are we rehearsing this for?

303
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,411
Are we going to record it?

304
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:46,912
Yes. We are waiting
for the final go-ahead

305
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:47,913
from my station manager,
and then

306
00:10:47,913 --> 00:10:49,348
we will be recording it. Yes.

307
00:10:49,348 --> 00:10:51,584
Anyone else?

308
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:53,886
Yes... actor.

309
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,356
I'm just wondering
how my monologue

310
00:10:57,356 --> 00:10:59,792
is going to be audible
over all these instruments.

311
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:02,228
Oh, that's a good point, Niles.

312
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:03,663
You may be seated.

313
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:09,402
It is imperative

314
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:14,173
that everyone play pianissimo
during the spoken portions,

315
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:15,675
very, very softly.

316
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,110
That applies particularly
to brass and timpani.

317
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:20,646
Why me?

318
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:23,549
To the drums, Tiffany.

319
00:11:26,318 --> 00:11:27,687
Oh, Dad, Daphne!

320
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,622
I'm so glad you came.

321
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:31,524
Well, after all,
it is the world premiere

322
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,292
of your theme song.

323
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:34,560
I don't have to
search you two

324
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,028
for any hidden recording
devices, do I?

325
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:38,564
The last thing I need
is some bootleg CDs

326
00:11:38,564 --> 00:11:40,399
flooding the marketplace.

327
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,234
Boy, you really got
everything here.

328
00:11:42,234 --> 00:11:44,236
Oh, it's not a time
for stinting, Dad.

329
00:11:44,236 --> 00:11:46,739
I've got everything from
the African rain stick

330
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:48,541
to the Javanese tam-tam.

331
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,110
Are the tam-tams the long ones
with the cream in the middle?

332
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:51,944
Oh, Kenny!

333
00:11:51,944 --> 00:11:53,946
Kenny, I'm so glad
you made it.

334
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:56,449
Listen, I think
you're in for
a bit of surprise.

335
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:58,217
Well, I got tell you,

336
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:00,319
I don't surprise easily...
whoa.

337
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:03,122
Our little ensemble.

338
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:04,990
So many musicians.

339
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:06,892
All working on a weekend.

340
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:07,827
Oh, now, listen.

341
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:09,261
I realize we are
a bit over budget

342
00:12:09,261 --> 00:12:11,363
I promise, I will pick up
the difference myself.

343
00:12:11,363 --> 00:12:13,799
All right, the time
has come to unveil

344
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:15,234
my magnum opus.

345
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:17,570
Just let me do
a little fine-tuning

346
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,904
on the opening fanfare.

347
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:20,906
Uh, brass,
if you will, please.

348
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:24,410
In four, the first measure.

349
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:28,848
(playing fanfare)

350
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:30,716
(fanfare ends)

351
00:12:30,716 --> 00:12:34,553
Well, you see, that's-that's...
fine as far as it goes,

352
00:12:34,553 --> 00:12:37,923
but this time I want you
to do it with a bit more...

353
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:40,292
grandeur--

354
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:45,931
with some majesty
and a soupcon of awe.

355
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:51,904
(playing fanfare
exactly as before)

356
00:12:51,904 --> 00:12:53,405
There, you see?

357
00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:56,809
That's what good
conducting can do, yes?

358
00:12:56,809 --> 00:12:58,511
All right, everyone,

359
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:01,347
the time we've been waiting for
is at hand.

360
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:06,285
And with a...
simple bow of thanks

361
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,621

what's your reaction?

406
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:09,842
Wow.

407
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:12,578
Takes your breath away,
doesn't it?

408
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:13,879
Wow.

409
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:14,780
I thought as much,

410
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,782
and in anticipation
of your approval,

411
00:15:16,782 --> 00:15:18,284
I had the forethought

412
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:19,785
to order in a
little bubbly.

413
00:15:19,785 --> 00:15:21,287
Niles, if you would
help me, please.

414
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:22,788
(laughing):
You were wonderful!

415
00:15:22,788 --> 00:15:25,291
Thank you.
The trombone
frightened me.

416
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:27,860
Wow.

417
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,362
That was sure something,
wasn't it?

418
00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:31,330
I'll say.

419
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:35,200
Sort of like Gilbert
and Sullivan-- only frightening.

420
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,437
A little jingle,
that's all we wanted.

421
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:40,806
Ten seconds to
start the show.

422
00:15:40,806 --> 00:15:43,309
Maybe Frasier
can cut this down.

423
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:45,811
He gives me harps
and drums and...

424
00:15:45,811 --> 00:15:47,613
people speaking German.

425
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:49,415
All we wanted was
a simple little jingle.

426
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:51,784

you came up with.

It's exactly the type
of thing we need.

Kenny, no.

No, if simple is
what you wanted,

456
00:16:46,605 --> 00:16:48,007
you should've
just said so.

for completely upstaging me
today.

484
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:53,572
Oh, come on.
I'm sorry I stole your thunder,

485
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:55,374
but it's not like I did it
on purpose.

486
00:17:55,374 --> 00:17:56,208
I know, I know.

487
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:57,676
I'm sorry. It's just...

488
00:17:57,676 --> 00:18:00,712
I don't know why I'm having
such a hard time with this.

489
00:18:00,712 --> 00:18:01,713
Well...

490
00:18:01,713 --> 00:18:03,715
maybe you're just thinking
too much.

491
00:18:03,715 --> 00:18:05,217
You know, look at me--

492
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:07,219
I go to bathroom,
I'm flossing my teeth

493
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:08,720
and that song pops
in my head.

494
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,624
Are you suggesting that
I bring out a spool of floss?

495
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:14,526
Well, it might not be a bad idea

496
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:16,361
for a couple of reasons.

497
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:19,064
Frasier, why don't you
just decide

498
00:18:19,064 --> 00:18:20,933
what you want to say
and say it

499
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:23,435
without a lot of big words
and showing off.

500
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:26,438
You know, and the tune
should be something simple,

501
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:27,806
something you can whistle.

502
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:29,675
I tried whistling that thing
you wrote today,

503
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:32,678
and I got light-headed.

504
00:18:34,012 --> 00:18:35,347
Of course it might've
been that last doughnut.

505
00:18:35,347 --> 00:18:38,851
I went back for one of those
African rain sticks.

506
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:45,290
The truth is, Dad, I

507
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:48,560
I'm not sure I can do simple.

508
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,796
Well, I don't know if you can't
or if you just don't want to.

509
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,731
But some of the best things
in the world

510
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:54,099
are simple, Fras.

511
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:55,501
Just like that art gallery
you took me to

512
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:57,002
a couple months ago.

513
00:18:57,002 --> 00:18:58,003
Do you remember?

514
00:18:58,003 --> 00:18:59,505
You were oohing and aahing

515
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:02,407
over this painting
of a big, red dot.

516
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:05,244
Yeah, Dad. But there is a
difference between simple

517
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:08,046
and deceptively simple.

518
00:19:08,046 --> 00:19:10,315
Well, all I'm saying is
that it's fine to be smart,

519
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:13,118
but you shouldn't have
to be proving it all the time,

520
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:13,919
that's all.

521
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,687
You know,
just as an experiment,

522
00:19:15,687 --> 00:19:17,489
tell me what it is
you're trying to say

523
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:19,825
stripped down to nuts and bolts.

524
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:23,128
All right, um...

525
00:19:23,128 --> 00:19:26,632
in my first stanza,
I want to represent myself

526
00:19:26,632 --> 00:19:29,635
as the... ombudsman
between the conscious

527
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:33,038
and subconscious minds
of my listeners.

528
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:34,439
Ah. Well, there you are.

529
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,441
There's the song right there.

530
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:38,944
All we need
is a rhyme for "ombudsman,"

531
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:40,846
and we can go to bed.

532
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:44,316
I was playing around
with "north woodsman."

533
00:19:44,316 --> 00:19:45,684
(laughing)

534
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:48,554
Oh, Frasier...

535
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:50,956
Look, I'm going to tell you
what your show's about:

536
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:53,425
People have a problem,
they're feeling low,

537
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:55,360
they call you,
you make them feel better.

538
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,261
Oh, for God's sake, Dad.

539
00:19:56,261 --> 00:19:57,563
Well, that's it,
that's it.

540
00:19:57,563 --> 00:19:59,331
Why don't you just write
about that?

541
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:00,632
How would that
sound exactly?

How will I ever find
a rhyme for "low"?

546
00:20:08,006 --> 00:20:09,007
Okay, smart aleck.

547
00:20:09,007 --> 00:20:10,509
I was just trying to help.

548
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:11,810
Well, thanks, Dad.

549
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:13,612
I'm sorry. It's
just not my thing.

550
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:17,115
Okay, well,
I'm going to bed.
