1
00:00:08,074 --> 00:00:09,509
Hello, Roz.
Hey.

2
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:10,577
So, what are
you up to?

3
00:00:10,577 --> 00:00:13,079
Oh, they put in phone jacks
so you can go on line.

4
00:00:13,079 --> 00:00:15,348
I was just talking to this guy
who sounds really great.

5
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:16,616
(sighs)

6
00:00:16,616 --> 00:00:17,617
What?

7
00:00:17,617 --> 00:00:19,119
I'm a very busy person.

8
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:20,954
How else am I going
to meet people?

9
00:00:20,954 --> 00:00:22,322
Just seems so
impersonal, Roz.

10
00:00:22,322 --> 00:00:25,325
I mean, my God, what ever
happened to human contact?

11
00:00:25,325 --> 00:00:27,327
Engaging people
face-to-face, eye-to-eye.

12
00:00:27,327 --> 00:00:28,828
There's your Dad.

13
00:00:28,828 --> 00:00:30,830
Oh, don't let
him see me.

14
00:00:31,331 --> 00:00:31,831
Hey, Martin.

15
00:00:32,332 --> 00:00:32,832
Hey, Roz.
Hi.

16
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:34,334
What you been up to?

17
00:00:34,334 --> 00:00:35,835
Oh, just
surfing the Net.

18
00:00:35,835 --> 00:00:37,604
Hi, Dad.
You know,
I never got

19
00:00:37,604 --> 00:00:38,872
into that Net stuff.

20
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:39,773
ROZ:
Really?

21
00:00:39,773 --> 00:00:41,207
You really ought
to give it a try.

22
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:42,208
It's a great way
to keep in touch

23
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:43,543
with your friends
and your family.

24
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:44,811
Family?

25
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:46,880
Gosh, you know,
that's nice to know

26
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,749
that some people still
care about their family.

27
00:00:49,749 --> 00:00:50,550
Dad, please?

28
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:51,951
Well, I got to go.

29
00:00:51,951 --> 00:00:54,521
I'm going night fishing
with Duke and Eddie, of course.

30
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:56,022
You know,
I wouldn't leave Eddie.

31
00:00:56,022 --> 00:00:59,926
You don't turn
your back on your family.

32
00:00:59,926 --> 00:01:02,128
What is that all about?

33
00:01:02,128 --> 00:01:03,963
Oh, our Cousin Dodie's
wedding was last week.

34
00:01:03,963 --> 00:01:06,733
Oh, excuse me--
Cousin Dodie's weddin'.

35
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:09,969
It's a Western theme.

36
00:01:09,969 --> 00:01:13,473
On the response card, it asked
for our chili preference--

37
00:01:13,473 --> 00:01:15,308
mild or kick-ass-- oh.

38
00:01:17,477 --> 00:01:19,379
Anyway, Niles and I told her
that we had a conference

39
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:21,748
to attend
at the Therapists' Guild.

40
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:23,550
There is no
Therapists' Guild, is there?

41
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,051
No.

42
00:01:25,051 --> 00:01:26,019
Dad found us out.

43
00:01:26,019 --> 00:01:27,487
Wait.

44
00:01:27,487 --> 00:01:29,556
Didn't you have
a "Therapist's Guild" conference

45
00:01:29,556 --> 00:01:31,558
on Alice's last birthday?

46
00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:34,427
The point is,
it struck a nerve with Dad.

47
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:36,296
Sorry, Roz, it's
just that, you know.

48
00:01:36,296 --> 00:01:38,298
he thinks we're ashamed
of his family.

49
00:01:38,298 --> 00:01:40,300
It's been an issue
with him for years.

50
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,668
Now he hasn't spoken
to me for days.

51
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:44,571
Oh, thank God, I don't have
to deal with this tonight.

52
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:47,907
I've already earmarked a fine
bottle of Chateau Beychevelle.

53
00:01:47,907 --> 00:01:49,609
Ah, hot date?
(chuckling)

54
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:51,010
No, no. Niles is coming over

55
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:53,279
to watch
The Antiques Road show with me.

56
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:55,515
I guess you'll be coming in
late tomorrow.

57
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:57,016
It's our favorite
show, Roz.

58
00:01:57,016 --> 00:01:58,017
Party. Whee!

59
00:01:58,017 --> 00:02:00,019
All right, stop it.
That's enough.

60
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:03,456
Oh, I think
the Road show

61
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:05,525
is from Harrisburg,
Pennsylvania, tonight--

62
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:07,527
Amish country.

63
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:09,429
Ooh, quilts.

64
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:11,297
I'll uncork
the wine, Niles.

65
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:13,066
You set out
the cheesecake.

66
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:15,168
Dad.
Dad.

67
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:17,904
Uh, I thought you
were going night
fishing with Duke.

68
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,842
You can't keep this
up forever, Dad.

69
00:02:22,842 --> 00:02:24,844
Well, all right, fine;
I hope you don't mind

70
00:02:24,844 --> 00:02:26,846
but Niles and I are
planning on watching

71
00:02:26,846 --> 00:02:28,581
a television show.
Oh, really?

72
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:29,949
Well, I'm surprised
you don't have

73
00:02:29,949 --> 00:02:31,818
a conference to go to.

74
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,219
Dad, we said
we were sorry

75
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:34,220
about Dodie's wedding.

76
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,055
Yes, and we did send her
a baby gift.

77
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:40,593
Well, Duke canceled out on me.

78
00:02:40,593 --> 00:02:42,095
You can have the TV
in an hour.

79
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:44,097
I just want to watch
my game show.

80
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:44,998
(groans)

81
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:47,667
Dad, please, not a game show.

82
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,002
I happen to like it, all right?

83
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,503
People bring in all their junk
from their attics,

84
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:52,805
and these experts
tell them what it's worth.

85
00:02:55,508 --> 00:03:00,246
Are you talking
about The Antiques Road show?

86
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:00,980
Yeah.

87
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,415
Well, that's
the program

88
00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:04,751
Niles and I are
going to watch.

89
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:10,990
I'll just check outside

90
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,492
and see if the world
has ended.

91
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:16,462
Well, if you want to watch it,
no one's stopping you.

92
00:03:16,462 --> 00:03:18,932
Oh. Wonderful.
(chuckles)

93
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:20,433
APPRAISER:
And you have no idea

94
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:21,935
what this writing desk
might be worth?

95
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:23,937
WOMAN:
No. My husband bought it
at a garage sale.

96
00:03:23,937 --> 00:03:25,438
Ooh, that's a lovely piece.

97
00:03:25,438 --> 00:03:26,906
I'd say it's Sheraton.

98
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:29,842
APPRAISER:
At auction, this would bring in
more than $8,000.

99
00:03:29,842 --> 00:03:32,278
Whoa! Ka-ching!

100
00:03:32,278 --> 00:03:34,214
WOMAN:
What about this chair?

101
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:36,216
Is it an original, too?

102
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,717
Oh, it certainly
looks it.

103
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:39,219
Nah, nah, they
always do this--

104
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,720
set them up on the first one

105
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,589
and then lower the boom
on the second one.

106
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:45,391
I think that carving
looks authentic.
So does the inlay.

107
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:46,793
No, no, no.

108
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:48,294
APPRAISER:
I'm sorry to say

109
00:03:48,294 --> 00:03:51,497
this chair is a reproduction
worth at best $150.

110
00:03:51,497 --> 00:03:53,733
WOMAN:
Oh, what a shame.

111
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,935
Keep watching, boys;
you'll get the hang of it.

112
00:03:55,935 --> 00:03:58,705
WOMAN:
Well, I guess
we still have the desk.

113
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:01,207
APPRAISER:
The real clue here
is the veneer.

114
00:04:01,207 --> 00:04:04,711
Veneer.
Veneer!
Veneer.

115
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:06,713
HOST:
And now for some
background information

116
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:08,715
on the beautiful city
of Harrisburg.

117
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:09,716
Mute!

118
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:12,485
(laughing)

119
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:14,153
Evening, all.

120
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:15,188
Oh, hi, Daphne.
Hi.
Hi, Daphne.

121
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:17,156
Wow. Don't see
the three of you

122
00:04:17,156 --> 00:04:19,125
watching the same
show very often.

123
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:20,493
What's going on?

124
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:22,862
Pavarotti
jumping the Grand Canyon?

125
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:24,197
It's The Antiques
Road show.

126
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:26,199
So what you
got in the box?

127
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:28,067
Oh, it's Donny's mother's
wedding gown.

128
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:29,969
He wants me to wear it
at our wedding.

129
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:31,337
What if I don't like it?

130
00:04:31,337 --> 00:04:33,506
Daphne, if you try it on,
we'd be glad to have a look.

131
00:04:33,506 --> 00:04:34,707
Just go put it on.

132
00:04:34,707 --> 00:04:35,942
Oh, Dad!

133
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,277
Dad, turn it up.

134
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,078
SARA BRIGGS:
But the real masterwork

135
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:40,913
is this unique
art deco headboard.

136
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:42,915
It features a variety
of veneers.

137
00:04:42,915 --> 00:04:44,917
Veneer.
Veneer!
Veneer.

138
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:47,387
Mahogany veneer...

139
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:49,122
Veneer!
Veneer.
Veneer.

140
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,257
...burled walnut veneer...

141
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:52,892
Veneer.
Veneer!
Veneer.

142
00:04:52,892 --> 00:04:55,128
...and zebrawood veneer.

143
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,629
Veneer.
Veneer!
Veneer.

144
00:04:58,831 --> 00:05:00,333
Oh, God.

145
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:04,337
Next week we got to pick
a different word.

146
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:05,705
You know what?

147
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:08,074
I need another
bottle of wine.

148
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:09,075
Yeah, me, too.

149
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:11,577
I love these educational shows.

150
00:05:13,946 --> 00:05:15,848
You know, I can't
get over Dad.

151
00:05:15,848 --> 00:05:17,850
It seems that
this little rift

152
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:19,852
between us
has been mended.

153
00:05:19,852 --> 00:05:20,853
Oh, can you believe

154
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:21,854
he used the word
"craftsman,"

155
00:05:21,854 --> 00:05:23,356
and he meant the
architectural style

156
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:26,826
and not the
rotary sander?

157
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,728
You know, that's uncanny.

158
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:30,096
Well, you heard him.

159
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:31,030
No, no, not that.

160
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,932
You just said
"rotary sander."

161
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:36,002
Dad, did we miss anything?

162
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,503
Nah, just some bozo
with a credenza

163
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:38,971
who doesn't know a Biedermeier

164
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:40,907
from an Oscar Meyer.

165
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:42,775
ANNOUNCER:
That's it for this week.

166
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:44,677
See you next time
on The Antiques Road show.

167
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:47,947
Next Saturday, the Road show
will be here in Seattle.

168
00:05:47,947 --> 00:05:50,583
Whoa!
Viewers can bring
their treasures

169
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:52,318
to the Convention Center
for a free appraisal.

170
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:53,753
We ought to go.

171
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:54,620
That'd be great.

172
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,422
Well, sure, Dad.
Does sounds
like fun.

173
00:05:56,422 --> 00:05:58,391
Yeah. You know, I'm going to go

174
00:05:58,391 --> 00:06:00,393
have a little root around
in my closet.

175
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:02,395
I'll bet I can find a nice
little objet d'art

176
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:03,763
they'll be interested in.

177
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:07,667
It's as if
that panhandler
I gave money to

178
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:11,037
was a genie granting
all my wishes.

179
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:14,741
Would you marry me in this?

180
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,679
(whispering):
How much did you give him?

181
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,682
It-it's attractive,
Daphne.

182
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:24,183
It's a bit unorthodox.

183
00:06:24,183 --> 00:06:26,486
Yeah, that's
what I think.

184
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:29,789
Donny, I've just put
your mum's wedding dress on.

185
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:30,790
A miniskirt?!

186
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,792
It's obscene. You can see...

187
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:33,793
What?

188
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:37,063
No, I took
the green box.

189
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,364
(laughing):
Oh...

190
00:06:38,364 --> 00:06:39,866
No problem, then. Bye.

191
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:41,367
I took the wrong dress.

192
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:46,139
This is from his mother's third
marriage in 1968 in Las Vegas.

193
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:49,742
(laughing heartily)

194
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:51,677
Oh, can you believe
people actually

195
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:53,179
used to dress like this?

196
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:55,181
I wish I had
a picture of it

197
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:56,682
for whenever
I needed a laugh.

198
00:06:56,682 --> 00:06:58,050
Niles.

199
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:06,993
MARTIN:
This bear clock's been
in the family for generations.

200
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:08,928
I can't wait to
see what it's worth.

201
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:11,497
Do you think they'll put
a dollar figure on it?

202
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:12,999
That sounds about right.

203
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:14,500
Very funny.

204
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,969
But you know your grandpa
passed this down to me,

205
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:19,439
and someday when I'm gone,
it'll be passed on to you.

206
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,774
Dad, please, I don't even want
to think about that day.

207
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,242
You know, I
got to go see

208
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:25,678
if I can get
this baby appraised.
All right.

209
00:07:25,678 --> 00:07:28,581
Oh, I am so sorry,
but on the way in,

210
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:31,083
I had the most amazing
celebrity sighting.

211
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:32,084
Hans Dietrich.

212
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:33,085
The love seat expert.

213
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:34,353
The very same.

214
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:36,022
Oh!
You know, he's
much smaller

215
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:37,757
in person than on television.

216
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:38,591
He's that big.

217
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:39,859
Get out.
Yes.

218
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:41,127
Hey, boys, come over here.

219
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,662
They want to put me
and the clock on TV.

220
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:44,664
Good Lord,
we can't appear on TV

221
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:45,665
with that hideous thing.

222
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:48,167
Everyone we know
watches this program.

223
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:50,169
Well, thank God,
he didn't bring along

224
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:52,171
that dreadful mounted
jackrabbit's head

225
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:53,606
with the antelope horns.

226
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:56,609
Oh, yes, the jackalope--

227
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:59,512
Texas's answer
to the Minotaur.
(groans)

228
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:00,813
So, what do you think
about that, boys?

229
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:02,815
They said they've never seen
anything like it.

230
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,317
Well, Dad, you know,

231
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:05,685
this could go
either way.
Oh, I know.

232
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:07,053
Don't worry about it.
I'm not going to act

233
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:08,554
like one of those saps
I always make fun of.

234
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:11,557
Doesn't matter if it's worth
two dollars or $2,000.

235
00:08:11,557 --> 00:08:12,558
I'm just going to say,

236
00:08:12,558 --> 00:08:13,993
"That's pretty much
what I figured."

237
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:14,894
Tape's rolling.

238
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:16,395
Oh.
Oh, Lord.

239
00:08:16,395 --> 00:08:17,396
Oh, okay, okay.

240
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:20,399
Uh, guys, uh, which one of you
wants to come and hold it?

241
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:22,668
No, no, Dad, we
wouldn't dream of it.

242
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:24,470
This is your moment.

243
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:25,972
WOMAN:
Everybody ready?

244
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:26,973
Action.

245
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:28,474
So, Martin,
what can you tell us

246
00:08:28,474 --> 00:08:29,976
about this pewter clock?

247
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:32,478
Well, it is a clock
set in the stomach

248
00:08:32,478 --> 00:08:35,414
of what appears
to be a bear.

249
00:08:35,414 --> 00:08:38,317
APPRAISER:
Actually, it's
much more than that.

250
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:40,786
It's Russian, made
in the mid-19th century.

251
00:08:40,786 --> 00:08:44,690
That's pretty much
what I figured.

252
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,659
Actually,
it's a stunning piece.

253
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:48,661
It was made
by Andrei Kuragin

254
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:50,663
who worked
for Tsar Alexander II.

255
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:52,665
That is pretty much
what I figured.

256
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:54,166
I don't know
if you're descended

257
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:55,535
from the Romanoffs,
Martin,

258
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,870
but all of Kuragin's
known bear clocks

259
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,339
were done exclusively
for the Romanoff family

260
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:02,842
and are now
in the Hermitage Museum

261
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:04,343
in St. Petersburg.

262
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:08,481
Martin,

263
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:10,950
you may be surprised to learn
that this clock, at auction,

264
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:14,387
would easily bring $25,000.

265
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:15,821
Ka-ching!

266
00:09:15,821 --> 00:09:18,190
(laughing)

267
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:19,191
Oh.

268
00:09:19,191 --> 00:09:20,726
What he means is

269
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:23,229
that's pretty much
what we figured.

270
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:29,168
FRASIER:
After you, Dad.

271
00:09:29,168 --> 00:09:30,736
Thank you.
(chuckles)

272
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:32,738
Gosh, Dad, you know,
I've been thinking.

273
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:34,740
Maybe we'll have to find
an appropriate place

274
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,242
for the clock.

275
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:40,012
How about right here
on this console, hmm?

276
00:09:40,012 --> 00:09:40,813
Oh, yes. I get it.

277
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:43,316
Doesn't look quite
so bad to you guys

278
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:45,818
now that you know it's
worth 25 grand, huh?

279
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:47,253
Oh, I could kick myself

280
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:50,590
for not bringing
that jackalope.

281
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,461
Quite an amazing day, eh?

282
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:56,963
(chuckling):
It certainly was.

283
00:09:56,963 --> 00:09:58,464
You know, Niles,
I've been meaning

284
00:09:58,464 --> 00:09:59,966
to ask you about something,
actually.

285
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:01,467
You remember that appraiser

286
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:04,470
said something about
the bear being from Russia

287
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,973
and Dad being part of
the Romanoff family?

288
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:08,975
Yeah, yeah. You know,
that struck my ear, too.

289
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:10,209
Yes, yes.

290
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:11,544
Course, I don't
seriously believe

291
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:12,545
there's any real
chance of that.

292
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:13,546
No, no, of course not.
No, no.

293
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:15,047
It's a long
shot, at best.
It's impossible.

294
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:17,049
Although we do
have the bear.

295
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:18,351
I know.

296
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:19,619
Oh, Dad.

297
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,654
Niles just reminded me
of something

298
00:10:21,654 --> 00:10:23,656
I'd completely forgotten.
Um...

299
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:27,159
When the appraiser mentioned
that the bear was from Russia...

300
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:28,628
Oh, yeah, well,
it probably got passed down

301
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:30,162
through your
great-great-grandmother.

302
00:10:30,162 --> 00:10:31,564
She was from Russia.

303
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:33,065
Aha!

304
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:37,470
And he said something about
the, um, Romanoff family?

305
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,306
Oh, yeah, that, huh?

306
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,141
Sure you want
to hear about this?

307
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:44,043
Yes, Dad.

308
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:47,346
Well, I guess you would've
found out anyway

309
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:48,848
after I died.

310
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:51,283
We're royalty.

311
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,396
But I didn't want you
to grow up spoiled,

312
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:08,701
so I abdicated and took a job
in Seattle on the police force.

313
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:10,970
It was kind of
hard giving up

314
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,938
that royal
way of life,

315
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:14,907
but I think
maybe it's the swans

316
00:11:14,907 --> 00:11:16,275
that I miss most.

317
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:20,246
Very funny, Dad.
Point taken.

318
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:21,247
Sherry, Niles?
Please.

319
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:22,748
Sorry to disappoint you.

320
00:11:22,748 --> 00:11:25,251
I know you'd rather be
anything in the world

321
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:26,185
except Cranes.
Oh, Dad!

322
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:28,654
Now, that is just not true.

323
00:11:28,654 --> 00:11:30,923
We are proud to be Cranes.

324
00:11:30,923 --> 00:11:32,058
It was just...

325
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:33,826
innocent curiosity.

326
00:11:33,826 --> 00:11:35,695
Well, I got to go call Duke.

327
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,196
But don't get excited.

328
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:38,564
He's not a real duke.

329
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:41,867
Well...

330
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:43,269
we stepped in it that time.

331
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:44,637
Yes.

332
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:46,472
What the hell
is wrong with us?

333
00:11:46,972 --> 00:11:48,941
Asking whether or not
we're related to the Romanoffs

334
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:50,476
and we'd just
gotten past

335
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:51,977
this whole "Crane
shame" thing.

336
00:11:51,977 --> 00:11:54,480
We should've known
it would just upset him.

337
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,482
Yes, and for what?

338
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:59,485
Trying to find some
distant connection

339
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:00,986
to royalty.

340
00:12:00,986 --> 00:12:04,423
Even if we could prove it,
what do we have?

341
00:12:04,423 --> 00:12:06,258
Story to tell at parties.

342
00:12:06,258 --> 00:12:07,626
Occasional seat
at a state dinner.

343
00:12:07,626 --> 00:12:09,095
Some meaningless title.

344
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:10,463
(chuckles)
It's insane.

345
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:11,797
Ridiculous.

346
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:13,299
Destructive.

347
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:15,301
Still, there is
this grandmother.

348
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:16,802
I'm right behind you.

349
00:12:16,802 --> 00:12:18,304
You know, Niles,

350
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:21,574
given our new pride
in the Crane name,

351
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:25,144
perhaps it would behoove us
to research our family tree.

352
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:26,946
Uh-huh. Actually, in a way,
we'd be honoring Dad.

353
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:29,281
Yes. Of course,
we wouldn't need to tell him.

354
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:30,583
No, no.

355
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:31,417
Just a few hours

356
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:34,253
on the Internet,
a trip to the library

357
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:36,589
we could sketch in
the entire family tree.

358
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,458
Sure, and if there should
happen to be a connection

359
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:40,359
to the Romanoffs...

360
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:43,195
Well, what harm is there
in that?

361
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:45,231
Oh, God, it is amusing
to contemplate,

362
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:46,732
isn't it, Niles?

363
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:48,634
You, me, Dad...

364
00:12:48,634 --> 00:12:50,903
all part of

365
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:54,507
an ancient and noble family.

366
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:56,842
Okay, Eddie, the jackalope's
gonna get you!

367
00:12:56,842 --> 00:12:58,844
The jackalope is gonna get you!

368
00:12:58,844 --> 00:13:01,747
The jackalope...

369
00:13:08,687 --> 00:13:10,122
Hey, Frasier?
Huh?

370
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:11,690
How's the
research going?

371
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:13,125
Oh, well, sit down, Roz,
I'll bring you up to speed.

372
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,093
No, thank you.

373
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:15,394
I'm meeting someone.

374
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:19,098
Dear God!

375
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:21,000
Not one of your
Internet dalliances?!

376
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,335
Oh, it's just
coffee, okay?

377
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:24,670
Besides,
this guy's totally legit.

378
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:25,604
He e-mailed me a picture.

379
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:27,039
A picture. Oh, for
God's sake, Roz,

380
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:28,541
what can you learn
from a picture?

381
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,042
The man's probably a
lunatic, a psychopath...

382
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:31,877
Oh, he's a pretty boy.

383
00:13:31,877 --> 00:13:33,679
Yeah.

384
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:34,947
Wait a minute.

385
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:36,715
I know this photo.

386
00:13:36,715 --> 00:13:39,118
It's the cover of this month's
Bidwell's catalog.

387
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:40,753
Are you sure?

388
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:42,087
I'm positive!

389
00:13:42,087 --> 00:13:45,457
I ordered those socks
and driving shoes.

390
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:47,760
Why would someone do this?

391
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,762
Well, he's probably some
insecure, would-be Romeo

392
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:51,263
trying to lure you
into a meeting.

393
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:54,266
Hello, Frasier.

394
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:55,768
Noel.

395
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:57,636
NOEL:
What have we here?

396
00:13:57,636 --> 00:13:59,004
An empty seat
next to yours.

397
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:00,406
May I?
No!

398
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:02,341
Of all the dumb-ass things
you've done

399
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:03,809
to try to get me
to go out with you,

400
00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:05,845
e-mailing me this picture
is just

401
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,813
the most moronic!
But, Roz!

402
00:14:07,813 --> 00:14:08,714
Forget it, buddy.

403
00:14:08,714 --> 00:14:10,950
I ought to take
your mouse cord and wrap it

404
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:11,817
around your nerdy
little neck,

405
00:14:11,817 --> 00:14:15,321
until your eyes pop out
like champagne corks.

406
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:17,823
But I didn't
send you this.

407
00:14:17,823 --> 00:14:19,825
Yeah, right.
Then who did?

408
00:14:19,825 --> 00:14:23,162
My guess would be,
that guy.

409
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:24,964
(gasps)

410
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:27,233
Oh, my God.

411
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:29,368
Noel, Noel,
I'm so sorry.

412
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:30,769
How sorry?

413
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:32,705
Not that sorry.

414
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:38,777
I just saw
the Bidwell's guy.

415
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:40,212
So, Niles...

416
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:41,780
how goes
the research?

417
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:44,617
Oh, I think you're
going to be very pleased.

418
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:46,418
According to this catalog
of Russian antiquities,

419
00:14:46,418 --> 00:14:50,823
the bear clock was last seen
in Moscow in 1879.

420
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:52,992
Well, hold on
to your fur hat, Niles.

421
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:56,962
I've just discovered that
our great-great-grandmother

422
00:14:56,962 --> 00:15:00,266
emigrated from Russia in 1879.

423
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:03,035
Oh, my God,
it's all coming together.

424
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:05,838
I can practically
picture the scene.
Yes.

425
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:09,608
Our great-great-grandmother,
smelling revolution in the wind,

426
00:15:09,608 --> 00:15:13,512
secretly slips away
in the black Russian night.

427
00:15:13,512 --> 00:15:16,448
Taking the bear clock with her
to remind her of richer days.

428
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:17,750
Yes.

429
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:21,620
The ticking hands of time
counting down her return--

430
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:26,125
her royal power
merely hibernating.

431
00:15:28,894 --> 00:15:30,829
(phone rings)

432
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:33,832
Yes?

433
00:15:33,832 --> 00:15:35,234
Yes, yes, I'll hold.

434
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:36,602
Who is it?

435
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:37,903
It's Dr. Myshkin.

436
00:15:37,903 --> 00:15:39,238
He's an attachï¿©
at the Russian Embassy.

437
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:41,040
Also an expert
on the Romanoffs.

438
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,775
Oh.
Yes, Dr. Myshkin.

439
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:45,144
This evening...
would be fine.

440
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:47,146
Uh, about 7:00?

441
00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:49,581
Yes, I live at the
Elliot Bay Towers.

442
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:51,951
We'll see you then.

443
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:54,353
He has some important
information for us.

444
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:56,588
Oh, my God, Niles,
this is it.

445
00:15:56,588 --> 00:15:59,892
The final link
to our royal past.

446
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:02,761
I'm going to issue
a press release.

447
00:16:02,761 --> 00:16:05,364
Not before I shout it
from the rooftops.

448
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:06,131
Here's Dad.

449
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:07,599
Hide everything.

450
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:10,102
Hey, guys, I thought
I'd find you here.

451
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:12,137
You know, you just missed
seeing yourself

452
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:13,906
on The Antiques Road show.
Oh.
Oh.

453
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:16,075
Yeah. And you know, the phone's
been ringing off the hook.

454
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:18,444
Everybody wants
to buy that bear clock.

455
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:20,913
You're not thinking of
selling it, are you?

456
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:22,348
You're damn right I am.

457
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:24,350
Some guy just offered me
$26,000 for it.

458
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:27,353
I'm going to buy me a big
honkin' fishing boat--

459
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:29,855
a Wave-Pounder 450
with a fun deck.

460
00:16:29,855 --> 00:16:33,625
Good for fishin', cruisin'
or just plain tubin'.

461
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:34,893
Did you hear that, Frasier?

462
00:16:34,893 --> 00:16:37,396
We can go tubin'.

463
00:16:37,396 --> 00:16:39,365
(sotto voce):
Do something.

464
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:40,866
You know, Dad,
perhaps Niles and I

465
00:16:40,866 --> 00:16:42,301
could sell the clock for you.

466
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:44,770
Oh.
I mean, we do know
the antiques world

467
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:47,106
and, you know, we could
get you more than $26,000.

468
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:48,741
I should think

469
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:50,509
at least $30,000.

470
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,511
Wow. You know, maybe I will
let you boys handle this.

471
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:53,445
FRASIER:
It's a wise move, Dad.

472
00:16:53,445 --> 00:16:55,681
Yeah, we'd hate to see you
get manipulated.
Oh.

473
00:16:59,985 --> 00:17:01,420
(doorbell rings)

474
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,488
(footsteps)

475
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:04,490
(door opening)

476
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:05,424
Dr. Crane.

477
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:07,893
Dr. Myshkin,
please come in.

478
00:17:07,893 --> 00:17:10,129
This is my brother,

479
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:11,930
Dr. Niles Crane.

480
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:13,232
(clicks heels together)

481
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:16,835
Oh, there it is.

482
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:18,771
Yes.
Yes, please,
have a look.

483
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:24,610
Is it authentic?

484
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:26,311
Without a doubt.

485
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:27,179
Frasier.

486
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:28,514
I know.

487
00:17:28,514 --> 00:17:29,815
Daphne,
if you don't mind,

488
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:31,250
you know,
there is some,

489
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,152
uh, caviar on the ice
in the kitchen.

490
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:35,120
Uh, now would be
the appropriate time.

491
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,555
If you would,
please?

492
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:39,491
Oh, I am so sorry.

493
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:41,493
Here I am
dawdling with the laundry

494
00:17:41,493 --> 00:17:44,863
when it's ten minutes
into caviar time.

495
00:17:45,864 --> 00:17:48,167
As I mentioned,

496
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:49,401
I have some information

497
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:50,936
which should be interesting
to your family.

498
00:17:50,936 --> 00:17:52,871
Yes, yes, please,
make yourself comfortable.

499
00:17:52,871 --> 00:17:54,373
Uh, do tell.
Do tell.

500
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:58,444
This is a copy of the diary
of Princess Sonya Romanoff,

501
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:00,946
daughter to Tsar Alexander II.

502
00:18:00,946 --> 00:18:04,383
At 18, she fell in love
with a commoner, an American.

503
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:05,651
(mouthing)

504
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:07,886
Such a union would, of
course, be forbidden,

505
00:18:07,886 --> 00:18:10,756
but Sonya decided to give
everything up for love.

506
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,191
(gasps)

507
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:14,093
Quelle elegance.

508
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,495
She enlisted the aid
of a scullery maid,

509
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:18,997
who smuggled money, clothing,
and this bear clock

510
00:18:18,997 --> 00:18:19,998
out of the palace.

511
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:22,000
She would elope
to America.

512
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,836
Yes, that was her plan.

513
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:25,571
But when Sonya

514
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:27,873
found her way to the train
station under cover of night,

515
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:30,175
the scullery maid
had absconded with everything,

516
00:18:30,175 --> 00:18:31,510
including the clock.

517
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:32,778
Servants!

518
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,581
There's a back
aching for the lash!

519
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:38,450
I'm moving as fast as I can.

520
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:48,594
But tell us,
how did we get our clock back?

521
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:49,461
Yes, yes, yes,
tell us,

522
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:52,464
how did great-great-
grandmama retrieve it?

523
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,967
Uh, Drs. Crane, your ancestor
is not the princess.

524
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,436
Your ancestor
is the scullery maid.

525
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:04,176
Well, on behalf
of the Russian people,

526
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:07,446
I thank you for
retrieving this for us.

527
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:09,214
You mean, you're just going
to take it?!

528
00:19:09,214 --> 00:19:11,116
Well, its rightful place
is in the Hermitage Museum.

529
00:19:11,116 --> 00:19:13,852
But this-this clock has been
in our family for generations.

530
00:19:13,852 --> 00:19:14,653
Niles!
But...

531
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,655
Dr. Crane, we could settle this
in the courts,

532
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:17,656
but you wouldn't win.

533
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:20,459
Do you really want this
to come out in the press?

534
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:22,261
Well, do you really expect us
to just let you

535
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:24,029
walk out of here
with a precious family heirloom?

536
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:25,330
Did I mention
that your ancestor,

537
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,332
before she married
a Noah Crane in 1882,

538
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:31,270
worked as a prostitute
in New York?

539
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,205
Enjoy your bear.

540
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,708
Oh, hello.

541
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:38,677
Dr. Profiry Myshkin.

542
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,145
Oh, Marty Crane.

543
00:19:40,145 --> 00:19:41,146
Well, I see you
got the clock.

544
00:19:41,146 --> 00:19:43,015
That's right.
Good evening, all.

545
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,383
MARTIN:
Bye.

546
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:45,884
You sold it.

547
00:19:45,884 --> 00:19:47,853
Hope you
got a good price.

548
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:50,355
Gee, Dad, I hope
you didn't buy a boat.

549
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:52,224
No, you know,
I was thinking of it,

550
00:19:52,224 --> 00:19:54,092
and then I thought,
oh, hell, you know,

551
00:19:54,092 --> 00:19:55,394
we've been
getting along so well.

552
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:57,729
You don't like fishing,
and you get seasick.

553
00:19:57,729 --> 00:20:00,132
Why buy something that
we can't all enjoy, you know?

554
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:02,367
So I bought this!

555
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:04,736
A Winnebago.
Yes.

556
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,541
A big one.

557
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,977
33-footer with air suspension
and power jacks.

558
00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:15,247
30,000 used, but you got
that much for the clock, right?

559
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:16,648
Of course.

560
00:20:16,648 --> 00:20:17,649
(laughing):
Oh, that's great.

561
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:19,084
We can go anywhere.

562
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:21,620
You know,
the first place I want to go

563
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:22,621
is Elmo, Nebraska.

564
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:25,390
We got a whole mess of cousins
down there.

565
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:38,971
Well...

566
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:41,473
we're out $15,000 each.

567
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:45,477
And we have to take
long trips in a Winnebago.

568
00:20:53,485 --> 00:20:56,989
And we're not Romanoffs.

569
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:59,992
We're descended
from thieves and whores.

570
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:08,000
You know,

571
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,002
I remember reading
that Henry James

572
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:13,005
once had a liaison with
a Russian prostitute

573
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:14,973
in New York.

574
00:21:14,973 --> 00:21:17,509
I'm right behind you.
