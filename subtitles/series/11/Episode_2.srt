1
00:00:09,242 --> 00:00:10,744
Oh, now look at that couch.

2
00:00:10,744 --> 00:00:12,746
Now this is something you could
consider for your new office,

3
00:00:12,746 --> 00:00:13,747
although I'm not
sure how well--

4
00:00:13,747 --> 00:00:15,237
what is that-- sort of
linen is going to wear...

5
00:00:15,749 --> 00:00:16,750
Oh, you know what I'm going to wear

6
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:18,685
to the opera fund-raiser
on Friday night...

7
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:20,186
or is it Saturday? I'll check my book .

8
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:22,677
A lovely linen shirt
with my new Zegna suit.

9
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:24,679
That's a funny word, "Zegna. "

10
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:25,692
The "g" is silent.

11
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:27,427
Silent "g" like lasagna.

12
00:00:27,427 --> 00:00:29,629
Niles? Yes?

13
00:00:29,629 --> 00:00:31,064
Do you notice that?

14
00:00:31,064 --> 00:00:33,532
You've been awfully chatty lately.

15
00:00:34,234 --> 00:00:35,235
No, but Daphne mentioned
it to me this morning.

16
00:00:35,235 --> 00:00:36,224
Ooh, what about this one?

17
00:00:36,403 --> 00:00:37,470
Frasier, you really
must make a decision.

18
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:39,172
We've been to six stores already.

19
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:40,469
Oh, and that reminds me.

20
00:00:41,174 --> 00:00:42,375
I must cancel our
squash game tomorrow...

21
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:44,244
Don't you hear that?

22
00:00:44,244 --> 00:00:45,578
Yes, now that you mention it, I do.

23
00:00:45,578 --> 00:00:46,579
It's sort of like a
nervous tic of some kind .

24
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:47,568
I wonder what could be causing it.

25
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:50,083
Well, let's see-- you do
have a baby on the way.

26
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:52,085
Perhaps your incessant jabbering

27
00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:54,087
is just a way of distracting yourself

28
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:55,588
from this life-changing event.

29
00:00:55,588 --> 00:00:58,079
How could I have missed
something so obvious?

30
00:00:58,591 --> 00:01:01,094
Well, it's not so hard to believe.

31
00:01:01,094 --> 00:01:03,085
You were 1 5 before you
realiZed there was a correlation

32
00:01:03,596 --> 00:01:04,585
between getting beaten up every day

33
00:01:05,098 --> 00:01:06,087
and going to school in a Panama hat.

34
00:01:09,602 --> 00:01:11,104
(whispering) : Niles! Mm-hmm.

35
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:12,594
Does that woman look familiar to you?

36
00:01:13,106 --> 00:01:14,107
No, but you know what does?

37
00:01:14,107 --> 00:01:15,608
This couch... we're
back where we started.

38
00:01:15,608 --> 00:01:17,177
Will you pick something?

39
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:18,778
Oh, my God.

40
00:01:18,778 --> 00:01:20,769
That's Ronee Lawrence.

41
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:22,282
Who?

42
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:24,284
She used to baby-sit for us.

43
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:27,787
Oh, my God. I-I had a crush on her.

44
00:01:27,787 --> 00:01:31,291
She's the first girl
to ever break my heart.

45
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:32,280
I used to watch her through the banister

46
00:01:32,792 --> 00:01:35,784
making out with her boyfriend... chad.

47
00:01:37,697 --> 00:01:39,199
Ronee Lawrence...

48
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:41,201
she's the fiend who told me

49
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:43,135
all those ghastly bedtime stories

50
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:46,306
about tiny insects that
would crawl into my ears

51
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:48,308
and eat my brain.

52
00:01:48,308 --> 00:01:49,605
Earwigs.

53
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,312
I-I wore a football helmet to bed

54
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:54,314
for a month after that.

55
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:55,315
Yes, yes, I know.

56
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:58,618
You really had Dad's
hopes up there for a while.

57
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:01,521
Excuse me... are you Ronee Lawrence?

58
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:05,225
Well, that's what it
says on my driver's...

59
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:06,226
Wait a sec.

60
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:07,527
Frasier?

61
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:10,230
Hello, Ronee. Oh, my God, it is you!

62
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:11,531
Good to see you.

63
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:13,233
Niles and I were just...

64
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:14,534
Niles... oh, my God.

65
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:16,236
Little nervous Niles.

66
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:17,537
I can't believe it!

67
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:19,539
Well, it's all terribly true.

68
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:21,541
Wow, you look fantastic.

69
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:23,243
Oh, well, it's a lot of work.

70
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:25,245
Of course it is-- you
know, exercise, dieting...

71
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:28,248
No, I've had a lot of work.

72
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:30,239
Every time anything sags, drags or bags,

73
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,552
I get Dr. Goldman right on top of it.

74
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:34,254
And then I call a plastic surgeon.

75
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:35,555
 Oh... that's funny.

76
00:02:35,555 --> 00:02:37,257
Well, it's nice running into you.

77
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:39,559
FRASIER: Oh, Niles, we've
got a moment, I think.

78
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:41,261
So what have you been up to?

79
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:42,262
Oh, I sing and play the piano

80
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:43,251
at the Wellington Hotel.

81
00:02:43,563 --> 00:02:45,265
Oh, great, great.

82
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:47,267
Of course I know what you do,

83
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:48,564
Mr. Big
- Time Radio Shrink.

84
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:51,571
Well, actually, I'm getting ba
into private practice as well.

85
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:52,605
In fact, we're here today,

86
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:54,300
picking out a couch for my new office.

87
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:58,578
I saw you checking
out the Barcaloungers.

88
00:02:58,578 --> 00:03:01,281
You... buying a chair for your husband?

89
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:03,583
Only if it's wired for electricity.

90
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:04,584
We're divorced.

91
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:06,586
Oh... oh, well...

92
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:08,288
You know, you must come by the house

93
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:09,277
to do a proper catch-up.

94
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:10,590
I know my Dad would
love to see you again.

95
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,581
RONEE: Actually, I'm free tonight.

96
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:15,295
Well, then how about
cocktails around 7:00?

97
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:17,597
I'm at the Elliot Bay
Towers on the counterbalance.

98
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:19,599
Great. It'll be just like old times,

99
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,301
except you get to stay up late.

100
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:22,602
Hey, Niles, do you remember

101
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:25,605
when I used to tell you
those scary bedtime stories?

102
00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:26,594
No, not really.

103
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:31,311
Yeah, you thought there were earwig eggs

104
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:32,612
on all the furniture

105
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:34,614
and you started taking
one of those hankies out

106
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:37,310
and wiping off all the chairs
before you'd sit in them

107
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:41,621
because you were afraid
that whoo-whoo-whoo.

108
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:43,623
 Nothing still. I'm sorry.

109
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:44,612
I'm glad.

110
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:46,326
For a while there, I was afraid

111
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:50,630
that maybe I'd scarred
you for life. Bloop.

112
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,332
Well, I gotta run.
I'll see you guys tonight.

113
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:54,334
All right. Bye.

114
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:56,336
(laughing)

115
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:57,325
Okay, go ahead, Niles.

116
00:03:57,637 --> 00:04:00,340
Oh, she put her fingers in my ears...

117
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,341
I understand.

118
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:03,332
Yeah, give it a good wipe. That's it.

119
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:08,303
So, Frasier, did you find a couch?

120
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:10,316
No. I must have tested 1 00 for him.

121
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:12,307
You know, have some sympathy, Niles.

122
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:14,610
Obviously my foot-dragging
is a kind of avoidance.

123
00:04:15,321 --> 00:04:18,017
After all, I haven't been in
private practice for 1 2 years.

124
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:19,959
Maybe I don't have the skills anymore.

125
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:20,960
Don't worry.

126
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,450
Your patients will never notice.

127
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:27,367
Well, if he doesn't pick a couch soon,

128
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:28,868
his patients will be lying on the floor.

129
00:04:28,868 --> 00:04:30,770
 What is this? Oh, it's
 olive tapenade, mmm.

130
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,405
You're going to an awful lot of trouble

131
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:33,740
for a "drop by sometime"
kind of evening.

132
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,435
Here, Daphne, try this
one... Oh, try one...

133
00:04:35,742 --> 00:04:36,743
Oh-oh-oh,
spring rolls.

134
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:38,711
... Oh, we found the
best chinese restaurant

135
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:40,413
Niles! Sorry, darling.

136
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:42,715
Still got the gift of gab, I see.

137
00:04:42,715 --> 00:04:45,650
I really don't know why you
insisted we be here tonight.

138
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:47,353
I just didn't want Ronee to think

139
00:04:47,353 --> 00:04:48,342
I was coming on too strong.

140
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:51,357
I was hoping this reunion
might start a countdown

141
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:57,363
toward a future lift-off
from cape crane-averal.

142
00:04:57,363 --> 00:04:59,299
If you tortured that metaphor any more,

143
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,596
you'd be before a tribunal in The Hague.

144
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:03,636
FRASIER: Oh, Dad, hey.

145
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:04,637
Hey, guys.

146
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:07,440
Wow, what's with the fancy spread?

147
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,509
day Niles and I ran
into Ronee Lawrence to

148
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:11,010
and she's coming over for cocktails.

149
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,512
You remember-- our
old baby-sitter.

150
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:13,513
Oh, yeah, I remember Ronee.

151
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:15,014
Pretty little thing, yeah.

152
00:05:15,014 --> 00:05:16,516
How's she looking these days?

153
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:18,017
Had her eyes pulled so tight,

154
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:19,507
she could land a role
in Flower Drum Song

155
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:24,791
She happens to look fabulous.

156
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:25,792
(doorbell rings)

157
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:27,794
Which you will soon see for yourself.

158
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:31,798
She's playing piano
down at the Wellington.

159
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:33,800
Ronee, hi. come on in.

160
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,495
Good to see you.

161
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:36,791
Meet my
sister-in-law, Daphne.

162
00:05:37,403 --> 00:05:38,504
Hi. Nice to meet you.

163
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,506
FRASIER: Remember my Dad?

164
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:42,497
Oh, I sure do. How are you, Mr. crane?

165
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:44,377
 It's Marty and I'm just great.

166
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:47,380
Gee, you haven't changed a bit.

167
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:50,543
Oh, yes, I have. I can legally drink now.

168
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:53,953
Hint, hint.

169
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:55,822
Oh, right. Would you
like a glass of wine?

170
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:56,889
Yes, thank you.

171
00:05:56,889 --> 00:05:58,379
Dad, why don't you get yourself a beer?

172
00:05:58,758 --> 00:06:00,526
So, Ronee, what have you
been doing all these years?

173
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:01,494
RONEE: Singing, mostly.

174
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:02,695
I play at the RendeZvous Room

175
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:04,130
down at the Wellington Hotel.

176
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:05,631
Is that that place that revolves?

177
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:07,121
It used to. It broke two years ago.

178
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:09,624
(laughing) : That's terrific.

179
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:12,605
RONEE: Yeah, I had a couple
of shots at the big time:

180
00:06:12,605 --> 00:06:13,663
You know, sang in some swanky rooms.

181
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:16,442
I even made an album: "Ronee Lawrence:

182
00:06:16,442 --> 00:06:17,932
Mood Swings. "

183
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:23,649
It sold about seven copies

184
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:26,853
and that's when Ronee Lawrence
had herself a real mood swing.

185
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:29,422
Well, I'm sure the
album was just wonderful.

186
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:31,424
You know, maybe I could interest you

187
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:32,425
in a duet a little later?

188
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:33,426
Oh, that'd be fun.

189
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:35,428
Wouldn't it, though?

190
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:37,419
I have a feeling that our
musical styles just might harmo...

191
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:38,919
t MARTIN: So, Ronee, I'll be

192
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:40,433
you really wow 'em at the RendeZvous.

193
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:42,935
Well, you know it's no
t exactly carnegie Hall.

194
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:44,437
Most of them are half in the bag

195
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:46,439
and just trying not
to spill their drinks.

196
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:49,499
And I'm just talking about
the cocktail waitresses.

197
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:51,778
This girl's a riot!

198
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:52,745
Dad, could you help me

199
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:54,747
with something in the kitchen?

200
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:56,449
Now? Right now.

201
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:58,751
Hey, don't be too long, you two.

202
00:06:58,751 --> 00:06:59,740
Mama likes an audience.

203
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:02,750
Good, 'cause Daddy likes to watch.

204
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:06,459
What the hell do you think you're doing?

205
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:08,461
I was working my magic on her.

206
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:09,462
Why are you so upset?

207
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:11,464
Because I'm working a
little magic of my own

208
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:13,099
and your magic is mucking up my magic.

209
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:14,600
I thought you brought her here for me.

210
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,838
Since when do I "bring" you women?

211
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:23,142
What are you, the Sultan of Brunei?

212
00:07:23,142 --> 00:07:25,144
(cell phone rings)

213
00:07:25,144 --> 00:07:27,013
Hello?

214
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:29,649
What?

215
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:31,684
Oh, you're kidding.

216
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:34,187
Yeah... yeah, okay, I guess.

217
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:35,955
I'll see you in a bit. Something wrong?

218
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,557
Oh, I have to go into work.

219
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:39,025
I can't believe it.

220
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:41,060
The guy who fills in on my
night off called in sick.

221
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,061
Oh, no. Sorry.

222
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:44,664
Promise me we'll do this again.

223
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:46,599
Oh, you know we will. count on that.

224
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:47,900
couldn't keep us away.

225
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:48,889
Frasier, you owe me a duet.

226
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:50,903
It was great to see you, Marty.

227
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:53,599
You should all come down
to the club sometime.

228
00:07:53,906 --> 00:07:55,608
You can count on that, too.

229
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:56,609
We'll be there with bells on.

230
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:58,611
Bye.

231
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:00,602
Bye-bye. See you later.

232
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:04,917
I can't believe the way
you are humiliating yourself,

233
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:06,519
a man your age.

234
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:07,720
Hey, she was flirting with me.

235
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,711
She was flirting with me.

236
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:11,713
You just got caught in the crossfire.

237
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:14,760
Daphne, which one of
us was she attracted to?

238
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,729
How stupid do you think I am?

239
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:20,233
Does it say "stupid" on me forehead?

240
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:22,724
Fine. If you insist on
humiliating yourself, how's this:

241
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:25,738
I'll invite Ronee over
for dinner this weekend

242
00:08:25,738 --> 00:08:27,240
and she can choose for herself.

243
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,730
Agreed? Fine.

244
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:32,245
Make sure she brings a friend
so there's someone for you.

245
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:34,236
I'm going to McGinty's.

246
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:40,553
You don't suppose he's sneaking down

247
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:41,247
to the RendeZvous, do you?

248
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:43,689
No. Only a scoundrel

249
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:44,678
would violate a gentleman's
agreement that way.

250
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,181
Quite right.

251
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:50,196
Dad is nothing if not an honorable man.

252
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,698
I don't know what I was thinking.

253
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:54,097
can we give you a lift down there?

254
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,602
No, I want to freshen up first.

255
00:08:56,602 --> 00:08:58,092
See yourselves out.

256
00:09:02,608 --> 00:09:07,980
e?? ?? Don't change a hair for m

257
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:11,677
You've only got the two.

258
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:14,987
?? Not if you care for me...??

259
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:16,682
It's a good thing you've got money.

260
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:26,832
?? Stay, little valentine, stay...??

261
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:29,835
Like you've got anywhere else to be.

262
00:09:29,835 --> 00:09:36,709
?? ... ?? Each day is valentine's Day

263
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:39,143
(applause)

264
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:46,686
I'm going to take a little break.

265
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:49,689
Try not to kill yourselves
from disappointment, hmm?

266
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:52,191
Hey! Frasier, what a nice surprise.

267
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:55,194
I guess I just didn't want our
little reunion to end so abruptly.

268
00:09:55,194 --> 00:09:56,684
Well, you're not the only one.

269
00:09:57,196 --> 00:09:59,198
I had a feeling you might say that.

270
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:00,700
There you go, Ronee.

271
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,201
Thanks. Hey, Fras.

272
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:04,704
Dad! Yeah, Marty didn't want
to call it a night, either.

273
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:06,205
He's quite the party guy.

274
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:09,197
Walter, you're alive!

275
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:11,210
You said you were going to McGinty's.

276
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:12,678
How long have you been here?

277
00:10:12,678 --> 00:10:14,680
45 minutes-- you
shouldn't have spent

278
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,681
so much time on your hair, Louise.

279
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:17,683
So, boys, who needs a drink?

280
00:10:17,683 --> 00:10:20,186
Yeah, I'll have another beer.

281
00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:22,188
You know, Dad, you really
ought to slow down there.

282
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:24,190
You know, at his age,
one slip and it's the Icu

283
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:26,192
and then it's "I see you later".

284
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:28,683
Well, I wouldn't worry about me, Fras.

285
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:30,696
I don't feel any older now than I did

286
00:10:30,696 --> 00:10:33,199
when you were parading
around in your mother's heels.

287
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:34,689
(chuckling) : Oh, well...

288
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:36,869
'course, that was just last christmas.

289
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:38,904
Listen, I've got to do another set.

290
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:41,407
Are you going to stick around?

291
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:43,909
Oh, you bet we are. Yeah, sure,
wouldn't miss it. Oh, absolutely, yeah

292
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:45,411
Ronee got me a ringside
table right next to her.

293
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:46,912
And that's because I want you

294
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:49,415
and your pockets right near my tip jar.

295
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:51,906
Oh, you're after my money, huh?

296
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:53,919
Say, Ronee, it's
such a beautiful piano.

297
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:55,910
It's a shame we didn't get
a chance to do our duet.

298
00:10:56,422 --> 00:10:58,424
Well, let's do it now. Really?

299
00:10:58,424 --> 00:10:59,925
Sure. You don't mind scrunching, do you?

300
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:01,427
My bench is a little small.

301
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:05,420
I don't mind scrunching at all.

302
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:07,433
RONEE: Hey, listen, is it just me

303
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:10,736
or am I getting some
signals here tonight?

304
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:14,440
Oh, it is most definitely not just you.

305
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:17,343
Hi, drinkers. I'm back.

306
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:20,780
And no, no, you're not
seeing double, for once--

307
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,782
I have a guest with me tonight.

308
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:25,251
Believe it or not, I
used to baby-sit this guy.

309
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:29,187
I know. I know. How
does she stay so young?

310
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:32,024
AUDIENcE MEMBERS: Dr. Goldman!

311
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:34,026
Aren't they adorable?

312
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:36,961
Please welcome Dr. Frasier crane.

313
00:11:39,498 --> 00:11:40,466
You know this one?

314
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:41,455
Oh, I love this song.

315
00:11:41,967 --> 00:11:42,956
Oh, me, too.

316
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:45,471
You know, and I'd like to
sing it to someone special

317
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:46,972
who's here tonight, but, well,

318
00:11:46,972 --> 00:11:49,275
I'm afraid it might embarrass him.

319
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:51,835
Oh, I'm sure your special someone
would just love to hear it.

320
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:53,379
Really?

321
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:56,849
Okay, then, here goes.

322
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:58,350
(plays intro)

323
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:04,346
?? I get no kick from champagne??

324
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:10,296
?? Mere alcohol doesn't
thrill me at all??

325
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:12,230
?? So tell me, then??

326
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:17,136
?? Why should it be true??

327
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:20,773
?? That I get a kick??

328
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:23,776
?? Out of you??

329
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:25,073
(Frasier misplays chords)

330
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,776
(resumes playing harmoniously)
?? I think you're cute??

331
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,074
?? Marty crane??

332
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:39,992
?? .. (playing increasingly loudly) ??
I think that if your poor hip wasn't stiff

333
00:12:39,992 --> 00:12:43,484
?? You could dance
just terrifically, too??

334
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:50,002
?? .. ?? And I get a kick out of you.

335
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:52,994
(plays final chords loudly)

336
00:12:56,308 --> 00:12:58,776
(woman over Tv) I'd like a "T."'

337
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,416
I'd like to buy a vowel.

338
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:08,819
Frasier? Do you realiZe
the door is wide open?

339
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:10,322
Yeah.

340
00:13:10,322 --> 00:13:13,793
PiZZa guy forgot to
close it when he left.

341
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,094
What are you doing here?

342
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:16,796
Don 't you remember?

343
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:19,365
We had plans to watch
Don Giovannion PBS.

344
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:22,027
I'm kind of into Wheel
of Fortuneright now.

345
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:25,905
Wow, you look awfully dapper.

346
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:27,907
Yeah, I'm meeting a friend.

347
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:29,408
Dad, you don't have to be so coy.

348
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:30,910
I know where you're going.

349
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:33,412
I'm having dinner with Ronee .

350
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:34,914
So things are going well? Oh, yeah.

351
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:35,915
Great, great.

352
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:37,917
Turns out she had a crush on me

353
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:40,408
back in the days she
used to sit with you boys.

354
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:43,522
Well, I better scoot.

355
00:13:43,522 --> 00:13:45,024
See you, boys.

356
00:13:45,024 --> 00:13:46,423
NILES: Bye, Dad.

357
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:49,259
Ooh, are those profiteroles?

358
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:56,535
Sorry. Did you want one?

359
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:59,038
No, but thanks for offering.

360
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:01,006
Frasier, what's going on with you?

361
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:04,009
You're showing classic
signs of depression.

362
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:07,012
That's because I'm depressed you nit.

363
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:08,479
But why?

364
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:10,003
Ronee and you aren't compatible.

365
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:11,951
You have few interests in common.

366
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:13,853
. She's as coarse as sandpaper..

367
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,921
I know. I know there was
no future for me and Ronee.

368
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:16,922
.. It's just.

369
00:14:16,922 --> 00:14:18,219
I'm depressed, Niles.

370
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:19,925
I... I...

371
00:14:19,925 --> 00:14:21,222
I don't know why.

372
00:14:23,495 --> 00:14:24,860
Wait a minute.

373
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:26,866
Yeah?

374
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,061
Wait a minute.

375
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:32,560
I think I can make a
really great sandwich

376
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:36,075
out of all of my leftover chutneys.

377
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:37,977
Frasier, you have got
to snap out of this.

378
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:39,378
You start seeing patients soon.

379
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,881
You realiZe you're only
using food to fill a void...

380
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,883
Oh! I forgot to void that
check to the dry cleaner.

381
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,384
I got my camel coat home.

382
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:47,113
It had a spot the siZe of a Krugerrand.

383
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:49,054
I know for a fact it
was not there when...

384
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:50,356
Niles.

385
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:52,358
Sorry.

386
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:54,326
What are you doing with Dad's velveeta?

387
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:57,062
t. What do you think I'm doing
with it?I'm going to eat i

388
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:59,997
Okay, Frasier, this isn't funny anymore.

389
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:02,301
Oh, my God.

390
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:03,969
What is it?

391
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:05,937
It's viagra.

392
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,505
They give that away with velveeta?

393
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:17,049
No.

394
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:20,052
It's a prescription for Martin crane.

395
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:22,354
Why do you suppose he
would put it in here?

396
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:24,056
Hiding it, I assume.

397
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:25,353
What better place than a box

398
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:28,193
that Pandora herself
would be loath to open.

399
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:29,125
(door opening)

400
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:30,429
It's Dad!

401
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:32,420
Oh! Oh! Oh!

402
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:35,634
(both sputtering)

403
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:36,635
Put it away!

404
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:37,636
Right, right.

405
00:15:37,636 --> 00:15:40,104
(muffled yell)

406
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:47,112
Dad, what are you doing back so soon?

407
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:50,104
I forgot something.

408
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:53,107
My, um... brella.

409
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,221
Well, you're certainly not
going to find it in the kitchen.

410
00:15:56,221 --> 00:15:57,711
No, I guess not.

411
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:07,366
Oh, I just
remembered--

412
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:09,068
Ronee wanted me to get her an appetiZer.

413
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:10,057
What looks good?

414
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:13,072
Oh, velvetta. That goes with anything.

415
00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:14,373
All right, well...

416
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:17,376
You boys have got your
opera that you want to watch,

417
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:19,071
so I'll just get out of your way.

418
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:20,367
See you later.

419
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:24,083
Now what?

420
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:25,384
Okay, okay...

421
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:27,086
We've got time to think.

422
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:29,077
It's going to take him a while
to discover that the pills...

423
00:16:37,396 --> 00:16:38,727
All right, where is it?

424
00:16:39,064 --> 00:16:40,395
Frasier took them.

425
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:43,402
Dad...

426
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:44,767
This is pretty funny to you, huh?

427
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:46,672
No, sir. Then what is it?

428
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,140
You're still so sore about Ronee,

429
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,541
you're trying to mess things up for me?

430
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,043
No, Dad, I found them by accident.

431
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:52,544
I tried to put them back.

432
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:54,046
I didn't mean to embarrass you.

433
00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:54,535
Here.

434
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:56,048
Oh, forget it.

435
00:16:56,048 --> 00:16:57,549
I'm just going to cancel with Ronee.

436
00:16:57,549 --> 00:16:59,051
Dad...

437
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:01,086
No, the whole night's ruined anyway.

438
00:17:01,086 --> 00:17:04,423
But the important thing is
you boys had your little laugh.

439
00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:06,258
Well, I'm glad someone enjoyed it,

440
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:08,260
because I'm starting to think

441
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,249
that it's just too much trouble.

442
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:10,751
I'm just going to break it off.

443
00:17:12,264 --> 00:17:14,767
Why would you do that, Dad?

444
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:17,759
I mean, you're not going
to let what happened tonight

445
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:20,272
end things with Ronee, are you?

446
00:17:20,272 --> 00:17:22,263
Is there something else going on here?

447
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:27,635
.. Well, I don't know. I.

448
00:17:30,582 --> 00:17:34,143
Ronee and I have been getting
kind of close this week, and...

449
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:36,155
Last night we started fooling around

450
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:38,457
and it was great.

451
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:40,826
I mean, I was rounding the bases.

452
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:42,828
The coach was waving me in.

453
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:46,331
There wasn't even going to
be a play at the plate...

454
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:49,201
Dad, it's us.

455
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:50,469
Oh, right.

456
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:54,462
.. Well, anyway, that's
when something happened.

457
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:56,835
. or didn't happen..

458
00:17:57,242 --> 00:18:02,147
which has never not
happened before. So...

459
00:18:02,147 --> 00:18:05,584
I decided today to go out to get some...

460
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,279
cheese.

461
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:12,357
I just couldn't stop picturing
her the way she looked

462
00:18:12,357 --> 00:18:13,859
when she was a teenager.

463
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:15,360
It was creepy.

464
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,863
And even with...

465
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:19,765
cheese,

466
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:24,532
I don't think I'd ever
feel about being with her.

467
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:28,329
Dad, when she was baby-sitting for us,

468
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:30,476
did you ever notice her?

469
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:32,144
 Yeah, she was a very pretty girl.

470
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:34,179
And did Mom ever notice you noticing ?

471
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:35,168
Oh, yeah.

472
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,171
Even had a fight once about it.

473
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:38,317
Well, there you are.

474
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:40,552
You're still feeling guilt and shame

475
00:18:40,552 --> 00:18:42,554
for being attracted to
her all those years ago.

476
00:18:42,554 --> 00:18:45,148
But she's an adult now,

477
00:18:45,357 --> 00:18:46,325
and you really should allow yourself

478
00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:47,693
 to explore these feelings.

479
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:50,696
very good, Frasier.

480
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:52,698
Thank you, Niles.

481
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:55,634
You know...

482
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:58,330
perhaps my depression over losing Ronee

483
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:02,641
was actually rooted in my feelings
for her from long ago as well.

484
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:05,310
After all, she's the first
woman to reject me,

485
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,645
though she never knew it.

486
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:09,148
I...

487
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:12,351
Perhaps by pursuing her again,

488
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:15,514
I was hoping to undo
that first rejection,

489
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:19,282
thereby erasing all the
subsequent rejections in my life

490
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:22,594
and giving myself a much
needed shot of self-esteem.

491
00:19:22,594 --> 00:19:24,425
Did you hear that?!

492
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:29,434
My analytical skills are on fire!

493
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:33,338
Your own-horn-tooting skills
haven't abandoned you either.

494
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:35,440
So much for worrying about
whether I'm ready to get back

495
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,942
into private practice.

496
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:37,442
The answer is a resounding yes.

497
00:19:37,442 --> 00:19:38,932
Well, you better be sure

498
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:40,802
because it's a completely
different animal, and...

499
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:42,848
I just remembered the Zoo'
s having a fund-raiser.

500
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,349
I signed you up for $200.
That's the safari level.

501
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:45,751
You know who has malaria?

502
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:46,852
FRASIER: Niles! Missus...

503
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,854
Do you realiZe that
your babbling kicks in

504
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,856
whenever I mention my
return to private practice?

505
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,653
Perhaps this condition

506
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,294
of yours has less to
do with baby jitters

507
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:57,229
and more to do with my
entering your domain.

508
00:19:57,229 --> 00:19:59,220
My God!

509
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:01,233
If I get any hotter,

510
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:04,236
I'm going to set off the sprinklers!

511
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:07,239
Oh, get over yourself!
Why shouldn't I be anxious?

512
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:08,740
can't I ever have one
thin g that's just mine?

513
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:12,077
Niles... It's like when I
discovered backgammon or fencing...

514
00:20:12,077 --> 00:20:14,580
Niles! Relax.

515
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:17,950
It's okay.

516
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:20,452
You are an excellent psychiatrist.

517
00:20:20,452 --> 00:20:22,386
I couldn't eclipse you if I tried.

518
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:26,291
Thanks.

519
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:27,280
You're sure?

520
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:31,363
Yes.

521
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:32,264
Splendid.

522
00:20:32,264 --> 00:20:33,265
And, Dad,

523
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:35,467
you should go down and see Ronee.

524
00:20:35,467 --> 00:20:38,436
She must like you an awful lot...

525
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,328
considering who she passed up.

526
00:20:41,773 --> 00:20:44,409
I don't know. I know it sounds craZy,

527
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:46,468
but I just keep seeing
her in that ponytail

528
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,846
and that parochial school uniform.

529
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:51,383
Ronee didn't go to parochial school.

530
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:53,385
She didn't?

531
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:54,786
No, that was our
other baby-sitter-- Sally.

532
00:20:54,786 --> 00:20:57,482
Oh, right. Sally the slut.

533
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,323
I liked her.

534
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:04,796
You mean all this
time I've been thinking

535
00:21:04,796 --> 00:21:06,798
she was someone else?

536
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:09,434
See ya.

537
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:10,731
Dad, don't you want your cheese?

538
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:12,437
No, thanks, boys,

539
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:17,739
but I'm working without a net.
