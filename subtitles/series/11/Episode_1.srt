1
00:00:12,145 --> 00:00:13,713
You trying to save Frasier from me

2
00:00:13,713 --> 00:00:15,615
or you trying to save him for yourself?

3
00:00:15,615 --> 00:00:16,604
Are you out of your mind?

4
00:00:17,117 --> 00:00:18,084
Are you in love with him?

5
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:20,620
Tell me now or I swear to God,

6
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:23,214
I will walk out of here
and I will not come back!

7
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:24,624
There's no chance

8
00:00:24,624 --> 00:00:26,092
you'll change your mind, is there?

9
00:00:26,092 --> 00:00:29,152
No, KACL is ancient history,

10
00:00:33,099 --> 00:00:34,067
Niles,,,

11
00:00:34,067 --> 00:00:35,068
I need to talk to you,

12
00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:37,070
You're not with Frasier, are you?

13
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:39,061
Why does everybody treat us
like we're joined at the hip?

14
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:42,075
I do have coffee with people
other than my brother, you know?

15
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:43,376
Good, 'cause I'm avoiding him,

16
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:44,365
Well, then, talk fast,

17
00:00:45,078 --> 00:00:47,080
He's meeting me in five minutes,

18
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,381
It's about my new job,

19
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:50,083
It's a nightmare,

20
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:51,818
Didn't you just start today?

21
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:53,319
Yes,,, my boss already hit on me,

22
00:00:53,319 --> 00:00:55,810
I'm supposed to work
nights and weekends,

23
00:00:56,322 --> 00:00:58,324
and my assistant is an
idiot and I can't fire her

24
00:00:58,324 --> 00:01:00,815
'cause she's like three
minorities rolled into one,

25
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:05,331
I can't believe I left KACL

26
00:01:05,331 --> 00:01:06,833
over some stupid snit,

27
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:08,334
Oh, yes, yes--
your ultimatum,

28
00:01:08,334 --> 00:01:09,836
Frasier told me about that,

29
00:01:09,836 --> 00:01:12,839
Listen, this isn't an easy
subject to broach, but,,,

30
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:15,341
is it possible you're
in love with Frasier ?

31
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:17,343
Absolutely not,

32
00:01:17,343 --> 00:01:18,833
You sound sure, I am sure,

33
00:01:19,345 --> 00:01:20,346
If I were going to fall for him,

34
00:01:20,346 --> 00:01:21,347
it would have been two years ago

35
00:01:21,347 --> 00:01:22,336
when we slept together,

36
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:24,350
Well, another theory
I'd like to explore is,,,

37
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:25,339
Whoa, back up!

38
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:30,312
You and Frasier slept together?

39
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:31,758
He didn't tell you

40
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,191
No,

41
00:01:34,694 --> 00:01:36,696
Well, I suppose it's only natural,

42
00:01:36,696 --> 00:01:38,198
When the wolf and the
lamb work together,

43
00:01:38,198 --> 00:01:40,200
it's only a matter of time
before the wolf gets his way,

44
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,169
I hope you were gentle with him,

45
00:01:43,169 --> 00:01:46,172
Just promise me you
won't tell him I told you,

46
00:01:46,172 --> 00:01:47,173
I promise, I promise,

47
00:01:47,173 --> 00:01:48,675
So,,, you're not in love,

48
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:50,165
But your behavior last night

49
00:01:50,677 --> 00:01:52,178
clearly indicates some sort of crisis,

50
00:01:52,178 --> 00:01:53,179
As a psychiatrist,,,

51
00:01:53,179 --> 00:01:54,681
I just want my job back,

52
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:56,171
I'm not looking for some therapy trip,

53
00:01:56,683 --> 00:01:57,672
All right, well,,,

54
00:01:58,184 --> 00:02:00,186
why don't you just sweep
your emotions under the rug

55
00:02:00,186 --> 00:02:01,688
and waltz back to the station

56
00:02:01,688 --> 00:02:03,189
as if nothing ever happened?

57
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:04,691
That's perfect , Thanks,

58
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:06,192
No, no,

59
00:02:06,192 --> 00:02:07,694
I was being facetious,

60
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:08,895
My real advice would be,,, I know,

61
00:02:08,895 --> 00:02:11,498
Talk about my feelings,,,
blah-blah, woof-woof,

62
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:12,499
I got to go, Niles,

63
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:13,500
Thanks again,

64
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,502
DAPHNE: Hey, Roz, Hey, Roz,

65
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:16,503
Hello, darling,

66
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:18,505
Hey, you,

67
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:20,507
Well, we're all set,

68
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:24,210
I got us a home pregnancy
test, a basal body thermometer,

69
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:25,370
and ovulation kit,

70
00:02:25,745 --> 00:02:27,269
NILES: Perfect,

71
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:28,381
I can upload all your data

72
00:02:28,381 --> 00:02:30,517
into this fertility program I bought,

73
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:32,485
You kids sure know how
to keep the romance alive,

74
00:02:32,852 --> 00:02:34,420
Uh, two coffees, please,

75
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,819
Since when do you need

76
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:38,191
a chemistry set to make a baby?

77
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:39,659
I hear a "in my day" coming,

78
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,261
In my day, it was simple,

79
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:43,263
The girl would put on something slinky,

80
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:45,254
a guy comes home, has a couple of pops

81
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:47,267
throws some Dean Marti n on the hi-fi,

82
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:49,258
 and bim-bam-boom--
you're lighting a Lucky

83
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:51,504
FRASIER: Dad, Daphne, hi,

84
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,199
How you doing?

85
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:54,507
Listen, Niles, I've got
to cancel our dinner,

86
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:55,508
I have to meet Roz's replacement

87
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:57,210
over at the station before the show,

88
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,512
What's this?

89
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:01,214
Are you pregnant?

90
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:03,216
Not yet, but we're trying,

91
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:04,217
Oh, well, congratulations,

92
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:06,219
You've got all the fertility software

93
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:07,520
and so forth?

94
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,523
Of course, We're not animals,

95
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:12,225
We're very excited,

96
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:13,226
Yes, we were up half the night

97
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:14,527
imagining life with our first child,

98
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:17,223
Well, first child you know about,

99
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,531
What does that mean?

100
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:20,226
Well, it's not what you think, Daphne,

101
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:21,534
I was just referring to the time

102
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:23,536
when Niles sold his
sperm to a sperm bank,

103
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:25,231
Surely, you told her about it,

104
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:29,230
Off I go,

105
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:33,239
You sold your sperm?

106
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,537
Well, it was when I was
home from medical school,

107
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:38,251
I saw an ad for sperm
donors, so I sold my sperm

108
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:38,910
to the sperm bank,,,

109
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:40,718
Stop using that word!

110
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:45,348
Say "S, "

111
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,662
I sold my "S" to earn some money

112
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:51,926
so I could buy Dad a Christmas present,

113
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:53,433
Which present?

114
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:54,457
The fishing pole,

115
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:57,794
You bought that with "S" money?

116
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:00,728
Why didn't you tell me

117
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:02,442
Well, it was such a long time ago,

118
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:03,431
it completely slipped my mind,

119
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:04,744
You're not really upset, are you?

120
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:06,446
Well, of course I am,

121
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:07,743
That was my favorite pole,

122
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:10,850
I just thought this would be

123
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,352
the first child for both of us,

124
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:14,343
You could be a daddy already,

125
00:04:14,854 --> 00:04:17,357
There could be dozens of little
Niles Cranes running around,

126
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:18,858
He could be your son,

127
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:20,360
Or him,

128
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,362
Oh, please, they look nothing like me,

129
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:24,864
Besides, I only went
down there one time,

130
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:26,855
It's possible they never used my sample,

131
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:29,358
Can I borrow your sugar?

132
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:30,358
DAPHNE: Yeah,

133
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,862
I'd better look into this,

134
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:44,717
There she is,

135
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:46,419
Now, I've got to warn you, Doc,

136
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:48,717
She's in an eelchair-way,

137
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:54,359
Does her handicap preclude her
from understanding Pig Latin?

138
00:04:57,597 --> 00:04:59,360
Dr, Frasier Crane, king of the shrinks,

139
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,367
meet Dana Willoughby,
queen of the sound board,

140
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:02,368
Hello, Dana,

141
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:03,369
Oh, it's my pleasure,

142
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:04,671
Likewise, I'm sure

143
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:05,660
Listen, if you have any questions,

144
00:05:06,372 --> 00:05:06,673
anything you'd like to know .

145
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:08,374
please feel free to call on me,

146
00:05:08,374 --> 00:05:09,375
I'm here for you,

147
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:10,677
You know, actually
there was one thing,,,

148
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:12,372
Will you excuse me?

149
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:13,680
Julia!

150
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,681
Oh, hi, Frasier!

151
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:16,382
Listen, we still on for dinner

152
00:05:16,382 --> 00:05:17,383
at Chez Henri tonight?

153
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:18,685
Yes, of course, Do
you have reservations?

154
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:19,686
Not as long as you're wearing

155
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:20,675
something black and slinky,

156
00:05:21,387 --> 00:05:21,688
Ten seconds, Dr, Crane,

157
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:23,389
Oh,,,

158
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:25,391
Listen, why don't you
stop by my place tonight

159
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:26,392
for a cocktail first?

160
00:05:26,392 --> 00:05:27,460
I'll see you at 7:00,

161
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,518
Okay,

162
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:35,535
Hello, Seattle, This
is Dr, Frasier Crane,

163
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:37,025
Our topic today is,,,

164
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:40,028
"New Beginnings, "

165
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,542
I'd like you all to join me

166
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:44,533
in welcoming a new member
to the KACL family,,,

167
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:45,778
Hey, Kenny,

168
00:05:45,778 --> 00:05:46,779
Sorry I'm late

169
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:47,780
Hey, Roz,,, Whoa, whoa!

170
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,482
What are you doing here?

171
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:50,483
I work here,

172
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:51,472
You quit!

173
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:52,485
Oh, come on, Kenny,

174
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:53,786
If I quit, would I be here?

175
00:05:53,786 --> 00:05:54,775
Who's that

176
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:58,691
I'm sorry-- I hired
her because I thought,,,

177
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:00,693
Didn't you quit?

178
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:01,694
Kenny, what's wron g with you?

179
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:04,397
Never mind-- I'll
fix it like always,

180
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:05,386
Oh, thanks, Roz,

181
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:07,624
I owe you one,

182
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:09,101
As many of you may know,

183
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:11,037
my producer of ten years, Roz Doyle,

184
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:14,040
has left us for greener pastures,

185
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,042
Now, Roz was not only known

186
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:18,544
for her producing prowess, but also for

187
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:22,503
her warmth, her kindness
and her gentle spirit,

188
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:28,421
Very well, then-- a
beginning of a new era,

189
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:30,423
Let's go to our first caller,

190
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:31,412
We have Scott on line two,

191
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,802
WOMAN: Niles Crane,

192
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:45,202
Hi, I'll get you a cup
and you can start,,,

193
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:46,172
Oh, uh, no, no, no,

194
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:47,673
I've already donated

195
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:49,175
my essence to your establishment,

196
00:06:49,175 --> 00:06:51,177
Now I'd like to get it back,

197
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:56,080
I'm sorry, It's against our
policy to return essences,

198
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:57,447
Oh, I see,

199
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,452
Well, could I at least check and see

200
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:00,953
whether my donation was used?

201
00:07:00,953 --> 00:07:02,455
You know, see if my

202
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:05,958
deposit has drawn any interest,

203
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:07,448
Sir, I've worked here 28 years,

204
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,962
Think you can tell me
one I haven't heard?

205
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:11,953
Go ahead, Try me,

206
00:07:14,967 --> 00:07:16,969
No,

207
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:20,173
According to our records,
your sample wasn't used,

208
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:22,675
So there are no little
Niles Cranes running around,

209
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:24,177
What a relief,

210
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:26,168
Isn't it?

211
00:07:28,147 --> 00:07:30,138
Thank you for your time

212
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:34,153
Just a quick question,

213
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:35,655
Based on my qualifications,

214
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:37,657
I'd assumed there' d be some interest,

215
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:39,557
Any nibbles?

216
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:42,662
According to our records,
your sample was discarded,

217
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:45,654
It was rated substandard,

218
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,168
Substandard?

219
00:07:49,168 --> 00:07:51,904
Your sperm had very low motility,

220
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:53,997
So they're,,,

221
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:56,575
Slow movers,

222
00:07:56,742 --> 00:07:57,810
Really?

223
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,512
But that, that was
more than 20 years ago,

224
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:01,514
s There's a chance that my situation'

225
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:03,149
improved since then, isn't there?

226
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:06,915
Can you run faster now
than you did 20 years ago?

227
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:11,090
So, you're saying it might be difficult

228
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:13,259
for my wife and me to conceive?

229
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:15,557
Very difficult, yes,

230
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:19,889
I'm sorry,

231
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,929
Uh, thank you,

232
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:28,574
Ah!

233
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:29,876
Excuse me, sir, Terribly sorry,

234
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:31,571
Carry on,

235
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,524
(doorbell ringing)

236
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:45,752
Eddie, you get stuck in there again

237
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:47,749
and you're on your own

238
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:53,766
Hey, Niles,

239
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:54,755
Hey, Dad, Is Frasier here?

240
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:55,757
Uh, primping,

241
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:57,270
Oh,

242
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:57,759
He's going out with Julia,

243
00:08:58,271 --> 00:08:59,272
Right, right,

244
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:00,773
Daphne's out with her mum tonight,

245
00:09:00,773 --> 00:09:02,275
so I thought I'd borrow a DVD,

246
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:04,266
Oh, well, you're in luck

247
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:05,778
I just picked this one up,

248
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:07,280
Crime Scene Bloopers 4:

249
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,271
You Have the Right to Remain Zany,

250
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:13,586
Sounds tempting, but I'm, uh,

251
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:16,088
I'm looking for something
a little more soothing,

252
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:18,090
I didn't have the best day,

253
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:19,079
Oh, what happened?

254
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:23,095
Got some bad news at the "S" bank,

255
00:09:23,095 --> 00:09:26,132
Apparently I suffer from low motility,

256
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:27,700
Oh, I'm sorry, son,

257
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,190
How'd Daphne take it?

258
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:31,637
Uh, well, I haven't had
the heart to tell her yet,

259
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:33,139
but, uh, I'm hoping I won't have to,

260
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:34,640
I did some research
today and I found out

261
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,143
there's some things I can
do to help rouse the troops,

262
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:37,944
Oh, yeah?

263
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:39,775
Like what?

264
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:41,138
Uh, well, such as wearing baggy pants,

265
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:43,616
and, uh, boxers instead of briefs,

266
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:44,605
Studies show that men who allow

267
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:46,619
their genitals to swing freely,,,

268
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:48,348
Okay, I got it,

269
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:55,661
No hot baths, no alcohol, raw seafood,

270
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:58,664
and I've started a regimen
of dietary supplements,

271
00:09:58,664 --> 00:10:00,655
Which reminds me,

272
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:04,003
What's that ?

273
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:07,406
French maritime pine bark extract,

274
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:11,978
It boosts fertility and
also acts as a mild euphoric,

275
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:13,969
which accounts for the
well-known joviality

276
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,977
of French sailors,

277
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:19,876
Terrible aftertaste though,

278
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:21,375
(grunts)

279
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:26,256
I thought those were
supposed to be crunchy,

280
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:29,752
Oh, Niles,

281
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:31,764
Dad, Julia's on her way,

282
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:33,755
You told me you'd keep to
your room while she's here ,

283
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:35,768
And take your
Cheeto-stained dog with you,

284
00:10:35,768 --> 00:10:37,258
MARTIN: Eddie, come on, boy,

285
00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:42,975
too, I'll be,,, I'll be leaving,

286
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:45,044
Oh, no, Niles, could you
stay for just a moment?

287
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:46,746
There's something going on in my life

288
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:47,735
that requires a bit of mulling,

289
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:48,741
Sherry?

290
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:49,949
No, thanks,

291
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:50,938
No?

292
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,653
But we never mull without sherry,

293
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,054
Not for me,

294
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:56,055
Very well,

295
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:57,456
Have a seat,

296
00:10:57,456 --> 00:10:59,048
Uh, I'd rather stand,

297
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:03,729
Suit yourself,

298
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:06,032
Anyway, it's about Roz

299
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:08,367
After quitting her job,

300
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:12,304
twice, she shows up
back at work again today,

301
00:11:12,304 --> 00:11:14,795
Waist deep in a sea of denial,

302
00:11:15,307 --> 00:11:16,797
Well, I confronted her on the issue,,,

303
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:20,813
What the hell are you doing?

304
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:23,115
Sorry, Go on,

305
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:24,684
Anyway, I confronted her on the issue,

306
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,686
and she refused to discuss it with me,

307
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,188
She wouldn't even look me in the eye,

308
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:32,680
Leads me to just one conclusion, Niles,

309
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:36,062
She's in love with me,

310
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:39,793
Uh,,, I wouldn't necessarily
jump to that conclusion,

311
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:41,795
That's because you
don't have all the facts,

312
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:44,770
I never shared this
with you before, Niles,

313
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:46,005
so brace yourself,

314
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:49,842
Two years ago Roz and I slept together,

315
00:11:49,842 --> 00:11:51,343
Get out!

316
00:11:51,343 --> 00:11:53,834
You and Roz?!

317
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:57,316
We did have a chance to
discuss it thoroughly,

318
00:11:57,316 --> 00:11:59,307
Talked things out,

319
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:04,188
And at the time she seemed
happy to remain friends,

320
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:12,098
I realize now that I must
have kindled a spark in her--

321
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:15,727
that lit the torch she
carries to this day,

322
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:18,370
So what do you think,,, (humming)

323
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:20,770
Are your pants humming?

324
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:28,114
It's,,, it's my test
icular hypothermia device,

325
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:31,817
It promotes motility by
keeping my nether regions

326
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:33,808
at a cool and constant 96 degrees

327
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:35,747
(doorbell ringing) Oh, dear,

328
00:12:35,888 --> 00:12:37,446
No, no, that wasn't me,,,
Yes, I know,I know that,

329
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:44,463
Oh, Julia, hi, Hello,

330
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:45,965
Good to see you, What's all this ?

331
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:47,466
It's dinner, I know,
We said we'd go out,

332
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:50,469
but I thought it'd be
more fun to stay in,

333
00:12:50,469 --> 00:12:51,470
And what's in here

334
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:52,471
Is this dessert?

335
00:12:52,471 --> 00:12:53,973
Well, you could call it that,

336
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:55,964
Oh! Hello, Niles,

337
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:57,409
Hello,

338
00:12:57,409 --> 00:13:00,412
Well, I'll just go start dinner,

339
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:01,401
Fine,

340
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:04,850
Well,,,

341
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:07,419
Looks like someone's
getting lucky tonight,

342
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:09,785
She was, but I'm beginning
to have second thoughts,

343
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:11,081
Why?

344
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:13,559
Niles, Julia and I have
never been together sexually,

345
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:15,550
Look what happened with Roz,

346
00:13:16,061 --> 00:13:17,062
We slept together
two years ago--

347
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:18,051
she's still suffering,

348
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:22,902
In the sense of pining,

349
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:25,404
Frasier, you don't really suppose

350
00:13:25,404 --> 00:13:26,906
that after one night, Julia,,,

351
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:28,407
Open your eyes, Niles!

352
00:13:28,407 --> 00:13:29,909
It's the same scenario,

353
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:31,911
An infatuated coworker,
a night of passion,

354
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:33,913
What if things don't
work out between us?

355
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:36,415
Every day she'll be forced

356
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:40,352
to stare through the glass at me,,,

357
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:42,822
wondering what might have been

358
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:46,280
until one day, like Roz, she goes mad,

359
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:52,264
Um, I'm leaving now

360
00:13:52,264 --> 00:13:55,267
Can I pick you up anything on Earth?

361
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:57,970
Oh, Niles, don't you see?

362
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,972
I'm just trying to be responsible,

363
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:00,973
I don't want to sleep with Julia

364
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:02,270
until I know that
there' s a future for us,

365
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:03,976
Well, Frasier,

366
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:05,273
I'm sure you'll make the right choice,

367
00:14:05,978 --> 00:14:07,279
but if you'll permit me an observation,

368
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,281
you do tend to take things to extremes,

369
00:14:09,281 --> 00:14:11,283
(beeping) Oh, I have to plug myself

370
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:13,979
into my cigarette lighter and recharge,

371
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:18,213
So,,,

372
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:20,915
alone at last,

373
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:24,152
Yes,

374
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,866
But, you know, there's
really no need for you

375
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,167
to go to all this trouble,

376
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:30,169
We can still have dinner at Chez Henri,

377
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:32,171
No, dinner's coming along great ,

378
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:33,873
In fact, um,,,

379
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,875
I've got a little sauce right here

380
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:36,864
if you want to taste it,

381
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,880
Oh,

382
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,177
Well,,,

383
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:51,579
Mm, That's yummy, yes,

384
00:14:53,592 --> 00:14:55,094
I've had such a stressful day,

385
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:57,096
You know what would feel great?

386
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:58,586
A back rub

387
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:02,101
 You know where I could find
a pair of strong, manly hands?

388
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:07,106
You know, I think Zoltan from
the club makes house calls,

389
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:09,108
Let me get you his number

390
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:10,910
Frasier, is everything all right?

391
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,411
Yes, of course,

392
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:14,380
Because if you're not interested,,,

393
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,915
Oh, no, no, no, I am, I am,

394
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,906
I'm very interested ; It's just that,,,

395
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,411
Before we take things to the next level,

396
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:28,060
you should know there are certain risks,

397
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:30,062
Oh, my God,

398
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:32,064
You've got a sexually
- transmitted disease,

399
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:33,565
No, no, no, no,

400
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:35,534
Of course not, Of course not,,,

401
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:38,037
Oh,,, Although, in a
manner of speaking,,,

402
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:39,038
(doorbell ringing)

403
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:40,027
Oh, excuse me,

404
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:44,543
It's Roz,

405
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:46,101
What's she doing here?

406
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,616
Listen, uh, just give us a moment or
two together and I'll get rid of her,

407
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,607
Fine,

408
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,121
Hey, Fras,

409
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:57,056
Hi, Roz,

410
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:59,124
Can I come in?

411
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:01,024
Yes,

412
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:03,996
Is,,, everything okay?

413
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:08,000
Look, I know how crazy
I've been acting lately,

414
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,004
I,,, here last night and
today at the radio station,

415
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:13,301
I mean, I don't even
understand it myself,

416
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:15,307
But then I took this long walk

417
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:17,241
and I think I finally figured it out,

418
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:18,744
I just feel so stupid,

419
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:20,245
No, Roz,

420
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:22,236
Not stupid,

421
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:24,238
Human,

422
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,252
And all too vulnerable,

423
00:16:27,252 --> 00:16:30,122
You've realized that
you're in love with me,

424
00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:33,025
No, that's not it,

425
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:34,626
Come on, I can see

426
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:36,662
why you would think that
based on how I've been acting,

427
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:37,663
but that's not it,

428
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:40,065
Okay, okay, just to be clear,

429
00:16:40,065 --> 00:16:43,002
you haven't been pining over
me since we slept together?

430
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,766
God, no, Weren't you there ?

431
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,512
Just, uh,,, hold that thought,

432
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,514
I've got to get in the kitchen

433
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:58,517
and move something back
to the front burner,

434
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,019
Julia,

435
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,077
Oh, let me guess,

436
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,222
Roz is staying for dinner,

437
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:04,523
No, no, no, Just us,

438
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:07,226
Listen, I'd like to apologize

439
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:10,529
for,,, being skittish earlier,

440
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:14,533
I,,, just chalk it up
to nerves, all right?

441
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:17,236
I mean, after all, this
is a big night for us,

442
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:19,538
We've never done this before,

443
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:22,141
I have,

444
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:25,444
Well, as have I, What I meant was,,,

445
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:27,446
No, no, I know what you meant,

446
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:28,447
So,,,

447
00:17:28,447 --> 00:17:29,448
You're forgiven,

448
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:30,437
Thank you,

449
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,451
Where were we? Oh, oh, yes,

450
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:36,155
I believe we were about
to sample some sauce,

451
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:38,157
Ow! Ow! That's hot! Hot!

452
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:39,458
Oh, God!

453
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,160
I'll just go get rid of Roz!

454
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,162
You know, we've got
so much to talk about,

455
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:45,164
What do you say we pick
this up again tomorrow

456
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:46,165
over a cup of coffee?

457
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:47,166
(laughing) : Okay,

458
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,468
My God, you have quite the ego on you,

459
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:52,171
We slept together like two years ago,

460
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:56,733
What do you think, you're some kind
of slow-acting time-release love bomb?

461
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:02,281
I don't remember you having any
complaints when we were in bed,

462
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:04,583
I seem to recall hearing
the term "stallion-like, "

463
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:05,584
I never said that,

464
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:09,655
Well, one of us did,

465
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:11,145
Okay, this is just too weird,

466
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:12,658
Julia,,,

467
00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:15,160
No, this is obviously
a bad night for you,

468
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,662
Look, Roz was just leaving,

469
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:18,653
Well, I'll send the
elevator back up for her,

470
00:18:19,164 --> 00:18:21,133
Juli,,, Oh,

471
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:24,636
Frasier, I'm so sorry about that,

472
00:18:24,636 --> 00:18:25,471
No, it's my fault

473
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:27,166
I never should have let you in,

474
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:33,178
Well, I guess I've given Julia

475
00:18:33,178 --> 00:18:35,481
another reason to hate me,

476
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:38,183
She doesn't hate you, Roz,

477
00:18:38,183 --> 00:18:39,485
Oh, well, she doesn't like me,

478
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:41,487
and when the girlfriend
doesn't like the friend,

479
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:43,188
guess who gets the boot,

480
00:18:43,188 --> 00:18:44,490
That's not always true,

481
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:47,192
Just went through this with my dad,

482
00:18:47,192 --> 00:18:48,454
I was always really close to him,

483
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:50,863
even after my parents split up,

484
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:53,866
and six months ago he married this woman

485
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:57,825
I don't get along with,
and it's like I don't exist

486
00:18:58,237 --> 00:19:00,171
I'm sorry,

487
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:02,474
That's what I finally realized tonight,

488
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:05,477
I guess I saw Julia
getting her hooks into you

489
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:06,478
and I,,, I freaked,

490
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:08,469
Roz,,,

491
00:19:08,947 --> 00:19:11,383
the day a woman tells me that
I can't be friends with you

492
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:13,715
is the day I know I
picked the wrong woman,

493
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:15,709
Thanks, Frasier,

494
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:21,660
Say, Julia has a dangerously
hot meal cooking in the kitchen,

495
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,362
Why don't you stay?

496
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:24,663
Oh, that sounds great,

497
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:25,652
But wait, She went to all this trouble

498
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:27,666
to make this dinner for you,

499
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:30,369
If she finds out I'm the one
who ate it, it'll kill her,

500
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:31,370
You can't tell her, Roz,

501
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:33,361
Come on, please,

502
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:39,878
(soft music plays)

503
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:41,869
Hello?

504
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:43,870
Hello,

505
00:19:46,251 --> 00:19:47,252
Daphne!

506
00:19:47,252 --> 00:19:49,388
What are you doing here?

507
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:51,590
I thought you had plans tonight,

508
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,524
Who says I don't?

509
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:57,229
Champagne?

510
00:19:57,229 --> 00:19:58,530
Oh, sounds wonderful,

511
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:02,234
Uh, on second thought, not tonight,

512
00:20:02,234 --> 00:20:05,537
I just thought you might like
something to wash down these oysters,

513
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:08,240
Oh,,,

514
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,242
Actually, I'm avoiding raw seafood,

515
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:12,972
Would it be too much trouble
to put them in a bisque?

516
00:20:13,478 --> 00:20:14,467
Now?

517
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:17,482
I'm sorry, I'm just,,,

518
00:20:17,482 --> 00:20:19,985
a little surprised by all this,

519
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:22,487
I thought I'd follow
your father's advice,

520
00:20:22,487 --> 00:20:25,490
A little less science,
a little more romance,

521
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:28,891
(whirring and beeping)

522
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:33,921
And apparently it's working,

523
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:40,772
That would be my TestiCool 2000,

524
00:20:40,772 --> 00:20:42,672
Your what?

525
00:20:44,676 --> 00:20:46,667
I should have told you this earlier,

526
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:49,381
I had some disappointing news today,

527
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:51,683
It seems that I suffer from low motility

528
00:20:51,683 --> 00:20:55,387
and it might not be
possible for us to conceive,

529
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:56,376
Oh,

530
00:20:56,688 --> 00:20:57,689
I'm so sorry,

531
00:20:57,689 --> 00:20:59,391
Don't be sorry

532
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:01,393
We'll be all right

533
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:03,395
There's so many things
they can do these days

534
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:04,384
to help infertile couples,

535
00:21:04,696 --> 00:21:05,697
True,

536
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:07,699
And until we find out more,

537
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:11,370
I don't see why we don't
give Mother Nature a shot,

538
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:12,667
I took the test today,

539
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:15,670
I'm ovulating,

540
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:17,609
Mmm,,,

541
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:18,610
(chuckling)

542
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,612
Well, in that case,,,

543
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:23,315
Iast one upstairs is a rot,,,

544
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:25,617
Oh, Daph, this isn't the ovulation kit,

545
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:27,619
It's the pregnancy test,

546
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:28,620
Oh, silly me,

547
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,609
They look so much,,,

548
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,949
We're pregnant

549
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:37,951
Oh, my God, we are, aren't we?

550
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:40,363
But my slow sperm,,,

551
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:46,071
I must have fast eggs,

552
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:48,407
Daphne, I love you,

553
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:50,909
I love you, too,

554
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:54,413
Oh, ow, oh, ow, that hurts,

555
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:56,415
Something seems to be short-circuiting,

556
00:21:56,415 --> 00:21:59,418
Ow! Ow!

557
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:00,407
Ow!

558
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:07,448
That's your daddy,
