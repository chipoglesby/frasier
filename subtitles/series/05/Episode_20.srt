1
00:00:20,953 --> 00:00:23,751
Roz, how are you?

2
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:26,428
Still pregnant.

3
00:00:29,878 --> 00:00:32,438
I'm sorry about last night.

4
00:00:32,714 --> 00:00:35,512
I tried to apologise,
but you ran out so fast.

5
00:00:35,801 --> 00:00:39,476
I'm sorry. Was that rude? You know
more about etiquette than I do.

6
00:00:39,805 --> 00:00:42,365
What is the proper length of time
you should stay

7
00:00:42,641 --> 00:00:46,111
after someone announces to 100 strangers
that you got knocked up?

8
00:00:48,355 --> 00:00:51,552
- I tried to call.
- I wasn't answering.

9
00:00:51,859 --> 00:00:54,657
I was up all night
thinking about what I want to do.

10
00:00:54,945 --> 00:00:58,221
A decision ofthat magnitude
would take many sleepless...

11
00:00:58,532 --> 00:01:01,410
- I'm having the baby.
-...hours to make.

12
00:01:03,996 --> 00:01:05,952
Are you sure, Roz?

13
00:01:06,206 --> 00:01:09,801
I know it's quick, but even
when I was hoping I wasn't pregnant,

14
00:01:10,127 --> 00:01:12,846
I knew if I was,
I was keeping the baby.

15
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:15,598
Then let me be the first
to congratulate you.

16
00:01:18,051 --> 00:01:20,611
It's so wonderful.
You'll make a great mom.

17
00:01:21,305 --> 00:01:24,502
I did the first step pretty well
and I wasn't even trying.

18
00:01:26,018 --> 00:01:29,727
- Have you told the father?
- I called him at nine this morning,

19
00:01:30,063 --> 00:01:32,736
which was seven o'clock at night
Cairo time.

20
00:01:35,027 --> 00:01:39,578
Is that pertinent or are you dazzling me
with your command oftime zones?

21
00:01:39,948 --> 00:01:42,826
He's gone to Cairo. He's an architect.

22
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:45,632
Wow. Really?

23
00:01:45,913 --> 00:01:48,950
- When's he coming back?
- He isn't.

24
00:01:49,249 --> 00:01:53,401
That's fine with me. I'm comfortable
raising this child by myself.

25
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:58,509
And I'm sure everybody around here
will give you plenty of support.

26
00:01:58,842 --> 00:02:01,993
Roz, who's the proud papa?
You got it narrowed down yet?

27
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,466
That's nice. Very nice.

28
00:02:06,058 --> 00:02:08,492
- Frasier, would you excuse us?
- Of course.

29
00:02:08,769 --> 00:02:13,081
Just remember the baby's future, Roz.
Try to make it look like an accident.

30
00:02:14,274 --> 00:02:17,744
I was just kidding.
I'm sure you know who the dad is.

31
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:20,823
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

32
00:02:21,115 --> 00:02:24,312
Do you remember Janet's party
a couple of months ago?

33
00:02:24,618 --> 00:02:27,496
You got really drunk
and I drove you home.

34
00:02:31,667 --> 00:02:33,259
Yeah. What about it?

35
00:02:33,502 --> 00:02:36,255
You invited me up,
and I'd had a few myself

36
00:02:36,547 --> 00:02:39,698
- and the next thing I knew...
- No, I don't believe this.

37
00:02:40,008 --> 00:02:43,637
I don't even remember us...
Just tell me you're joking.

38
00:02:43,971 --> 00:02:46,804
We don't have to get married
right away.

39
00:02:48,725 --> 00:02:52,764
I thought you'd be happy about this.
I mean, we were wonderful together.

40
00:02:53,105 --> 00:02:56,302
When you made love to me,
you were so tender and caring...

41
00:02:58,861 --> 00:03:01,136
Tender and caring? No way was that me.

42
00:03:02,406 --> 00:03:05,239
You almost had me. Good one, Roz.

43
00:03:09,163 --> 00:03:11,154
- Someone at the door.
- Really?

44
00:03:11,415 --> 00:03:14,009
So that's what that chiming sound means.

45
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,951
I'm indisposed. Would you mind?

46
00:03:17,212 --> 00:03:19,601
Sure. Sorry, Daph.
Hang on, she's coming.

47
00:03:21,258 --> 00:03:25,297
You take it easy. Rest up
for that big trek to the dinner table.

48
00:03:27,764 --> 00:03:29,197
Hello, Dr Crane.

49
00:03:29,433 --> 00:03:32,789
Daphne, before I come in,
I have to say I am mortified

50
00:03:33,103 --> 00:03:36,459
about my behaviour last night.
I don't know what got into me.

51
00:03:36,774 --> 00:03:39,493
About a quart ofvodka, for starters.

52
00:03:40,652 --> 00:03:42,961
There's no need for an apology.

53
00:03:43,238 --> 00:03:45,911
I thought what you did
was very chivalrous.

54
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,272
I believe if a woman
finds herself in such a predicament,

55
00:03:49,578 --> 00:03:52,536
a man of honour has an obligation
to do the right thing.

56
00:03:52,831 --> 00:03:56,983
- And poor Roz is in that predicament.
- Do I smell chicken?

57
00:03:58,754 --> 00:04:01,905
We'll be serving dinner
as soon as Roz gets here.

58
00:04:02,216 --> 00:04:04,207
I didn't think she should be alone.

59
00:04:04,468 --> 00:04:05,947
How's she doing?

60
00:04:06,178 --> 00:04:10,968
OK, considering
she's decided to have the child herself.

61
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:13,341
Things have changed since my day.

62
00:04:13,602 --> 00:04:16,560
Back then, if a girl got in trouble,
herfamily'd ship her off

63
00:04:16,855 --> 00:04:21,087
to relatives and if anybody asked,
just lied and said she went to Europe.

64
00:04:21,443 --> 00:04:25,152
Then when she came back, they'd
raise the baby as a little sister.

65
00:04:25,489 --> 00:04:29,164
Not like today.
We had morals and values back then.

66
00:04:33,205 --> 00:04:36,993
I assumed I'd have children,
but if Maris and I don't reconcile soon,

67
00:04:37,334 --> 00:04:39,689
the issue will be moot.
She's older than I am.

68
00:04:39,962 --> 00:04:42,271
and her biological clock
is winding down.

69
00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:45,699
Luckily she flies to Zürich
twice a yearto have it reset.

70
00:04:50,764 --> 00:04:54,200
Babies are wonderful, but Roz
does have a rough road ahead of her.

71
00:04:54,518 --> 00:04:57,510
It can never be easy
balancing a career with motherhood.

72
00:04:57,813 --> 00:05:02,329
Where will she find a husband?
A kid needs a mother and a father.

73
00:05:02,693 --> 00:05:06,606
That's Roz. Now remember she came here
to have a relaxing dinner,

74
00:05:06,947 --> 00:05:09,939
not to be reminded of
the situation that she's in.

75
00:05:10,242 --> 00:05:14,360
If she doesn't bring it up,
we won't discuss it. Agreed?

76
00:05:14,705 --> 00:05:16,218
All right.

77
00:05:16,457 --> 00:05:18,687
Daphne, you may answer the door.

78
00:05:21,628 --> 00:05:23,584
Well, thank you.

79
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:27,946
Why don't I get a feather duster
and a French maid's uniform?

80
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:32,378
That would teach them, wouldn't it,
Daphne, and I would pick it out for you.

81
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:36,841
- Hello, Roz.
- Hey, Daphne.

82
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:41,160
Dinner's almost ready.
You just make yourself comfortable.

83
00:05:51,283 --> 00:05:54,753
- That's such a cute skirt.
- Thanks. I just got it.

84
00:06:00,417 --> 00:06:03,136
I just got these pants.

85
00:06:06,089 --> 00:06:08,080
They're nice.

86
00:06:12,721 --> 00:06:14,996
I got some interesting news last night.

87
00:06:15,265 --> 00:06:19,099
Well, I and a large portion of Seattle
found out I was pregnant.

88
00:06:20,354 --> 00:06:22,345
Don't you want to ask me about it?

89
00:06:22,606 --> 00:06:25,245
Yes, of course we do,
but we were told not to.

90
00:06:25,526 --> 00:06:28,802
Frasier's afraid we might
make you uncomfortable.

91
00:06:29,113 --> 00:06:31,911
I want to talk about it.
I'm really excited.

92
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:34,394
I'm going to be a mom.
I've got a lot to do.

93
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:38,369
- One thing I've got to get pronto...
- A husband.

94
00:06:40,165 --> 00:06:42,963
I was going to say a bigger apartment.

95
00:06:44,253 --> 00:06:46,244
Maybe the husband'll have one.

96
00:06:47,965 --> 00:06:50,525
How did the father take it
when you told him?

97
00:06:52,094 --> 00:06:55,370
- Don't worry, she brought it up.
- He took it very well.

98
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:58,514
He won't be that involved.
He moved to Cairo.

99
00:06:58,809 --> 00:07:02,404
Where would he have moved to
if he had taken it badly?

100
00:07:04,231 --> 00:07:08,110
No, he's working in Cairo on a project.
He's an archaeologist.

101
00:07:08,444 --> 00:07:11,481
Roz, why don't we get you
something to drink?

102
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:15,409
- Do you have any mineral water?
- Eight kinds. Come and pick one.

103
00:07:15,742 --> 00:07:18,176
He's got room for
all that water in that fridge,

104
00:07:18,454 --> 00:07:22,891
and I have to keep
my can of spray cheese under the sink.

105
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:28,085
This morning you told me
the father was an architect.

106
00:07:28,464 --> 00:07:31,103
I did? That was a slip of the tongue.

107
00:07:33,343 --> 00:07:36,016
- How did you two meet again?
- In a bar.

108
00:07:36,305 --> 00:07:40,662
- You told me it was on a double date.
- Yes, it was on a double date.

109
00:07:41,018 --> 00:07:43,009
You told me nothing.

110
00:07:45,522 --> 00:07:48,355
What is going on, Roz?
You're hiding something.

111
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:51,722
Niles, please, would you excuse us?

112
00:07:52,029 --> 00:07:55,226
By all means. I just came in
to open a bottle ofwine. Sorry.

113
00:07:57,284 --> 00:07:59,639
Is it that you
don't know who the father is?

114
00:07:59,912 --> 00:08:01,903
Of course I know.

115
00:08:02,164 --> 00:08:06,715
- Why don't you tell me?
- Because I haven't even told him yet.

116
00:08:08,545 --> 00:08:11,696
I'm not sure I'm going to tell him.
It's complicated.

117
00:08:12,007 --> 00:08:16,159
I don't care who he is but he has
a right to know he's having a child.

118
00:08:16,512 --> 00:08:21,427
- This isn't any ofyour business.
- It's certainly his business.

119
00:08:21,809 --> 00:08:25,245
You have an obligation to let him know
you're having his baby.

120
00:08:25,562 --> 00:08:29,237
Niles, do you mind? It's impossible
to have a private conversation

121
00:08:29,566 --> 00:08:31,557
with you eavesdropping.

122
00:08:31,819 --> 00:08:35,050
I resent the implication
that I have nothing better to do

123
00:08:35,364 --> 00:08:39,118
than spy on you like a nosy teenager.
I came in for a corkscrew.

124
00:08:39,451 --> 00:08:41,442
I'm sorry.

125
00:08:44,331 --> 00:08:46,925
All I could get
was she hasn't told the father.

126
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:53,439
- Double latte, please.
- I'll bring it over.

127
00:08:53,715 --> 00:08:55,706
Thank you.

128
00:08:56,218 --> 00:08:59,847
- Morning, Roz.
- Frasier? What are you doing here?

129
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,648
It must be a shock
to find me here in this place

130
00:09:02,933 --> 00:09:05,163
that I come to every day of my life.

131
00:09:05,436 --> 00:09:09,111
- You had a dental appointment.
- I rescheduled it.

132
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,671
- Thanks for telling me.
- What's going on?

133
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:16,375
- I came here to talk to him.
- The father?

134
00:09:16,697 --> 00:09:19,370
- I'm proud of you.
- Now get out of here.

135
00:09:19,658 --> 00:09:22,775
- May I have that to go, please?
- Sure, Dr Crane.

136
00:09:23,078 --> 00:09:25,194
- Roz, how are you doing?
- Good. You?

137
00:09:25,456 --> 00:09:29,335
- Great. What can I get you?
- I'll have a decaf, thanks.

138
00:09:29,668 --> 00:09:31,260
Thank you.

139
00:09:31,503 --> 00:09:33,300
- He's a nice kid.
- Yes.

140
00:09:33,547 --> 00:09:36,015
- Working to put himself through school.
- Yes.

141
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,689
- He's the father, isn't he?
- Yes.

142
00:09:48,687 --> 00:09:50,996
The father ofyour child is a teenager?

143
00:09:51,273 --> 00:09:55,869
He's not a teenager, anymore.
He had a birthday three weeks ago.

144
00:09:56,737 --> 00:09:59,968
We just went out for a couple ofweeks,
and then it was over.

145
00:10:00,282 --> 00:10:02,955
It's embarrassing, though,

146
00:10:03,243 --> 00:10:07,714
him being seven years younger than I am.
Put your eyebrows down.

147
00:10:09,124 --> 00:10:12,480
I've seen your driver's licence,
and you don't weigh no 1 70.

148
00:10:15,339 --> 00:10:18,934
Now you know what I'm talking about.
I don't want to ruin his life.

149
00:10:19,259 --> 00:10:22,456
- He still has a right to know.
- I know that.

150
00:10:23,138 --> 00:10:27,370
It won't be easy. When you
were in college, if a woman told you

151
00:10:27,726 --> 00:10:31,480
she was carrying your child,
wouldn't you have been devastated?

152
00:10:31,814 --> 00:10:34,487
In my case, I would've been mystified.

153
00:10:35,651 --> 00:10:39,439
- How do I even begin to tell him?
- It's never easy.

154
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,896
So, Roz, what made you switch to decaf?

155
00:10:42,157 --> 00:10:45,866
Then sometimes a natural opening
does present itself.

156
00:10:46,203 --> 00:10:50,401
Trying to stay healthy. I called this
morning and your number wasn't working.

157
00:10:50,749 --> 00:10:52,023
I'm not in the dorms.

158
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:56,961
- Did you get your own place?
- No, I moved back in with my parents.

159
00:10:57,339 --> 00:11:02,049
- Frasier, your dad's waving to you.
- Right. Like my dad's waving to me.

160
00:11:03,053 --> 00:11:05,772
My dad's over there waving to me.
Excuse me.

161
00:11:07,683 --> 00:11:10,072
You look incredible.

162
00:11:10,352 --> 00:11:12,070
- I do?
- Yeah.

163
00:11:12,312 --> 00:11:14,303
Dad, what brings you here?

164
00:11:14,565 --> 00:11:19,480
Sherry took her sister across the street
to buy some foundation garments.

165
00:11:19,862 --> 00:11:23,411
- I think they call them bras now.
- Not these you don't.

166
00:11:24,867 --> 00:11:28,382
You could cross the River Kwai
on one of those babies.

167
00:11:29,872 --> 00:11:33,342
- I have something to tell you.
- I've got some news, too.

168
00:11:33,667 --> 00:11:36,500
Remember that junior year
abroad programme?

169
00:11:36,795 --> 00:11:41,346
I'm in. I am leaving next week and
spending the rest ofthe year in Paris.

170
00:11:41,717 --> 00:11:43,673
Congratulations. I'm happy for you.

171
00:11:43,927 --> 00:11:46,885
Thanks. First my soccer team
wins the championship,

172
00:11:47,181 --> 00:11:49,854
then I ace my finals,
and now I'm going to Paris.

173
00:11:50,142 --> 00:11:52,133
I'm starting to think, what's next?

174
00:11:54,563 --> 00:11:56,872
Funny you should ask.

175
00:11:57,149 --> 00:12:00,061
- There's something in my eye.
- I don't see anything.

176
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,476
- Are you sure?
- I don't see anything.

177
00:12:02,738 --> 00:12:04,808
- You're not looking.
- All right.

178
00:12:05,073 --> 00:12:06,791
No, don't touch!

179
00:12:08,911 --> 00:12:10,947
Look, Dad, I've got to go talk to Roz.

180
00:12:11,205 --> 00:12:14,083
Go to the men's room
and rinse it with cold water.

181
00:12:14,374 --> 00:12:18,890
I'm glad I worked all those extra shifts
to put you through medical school.

182
00:12:24,176 --> 00:12:26,167
- Roz?
- Don't worry, I told him.

183
00:12:26,428 --> 00:12:30,307
- How did he take it?
- He was pretty freaked out.

184
00:12:30,641 --> 00:12:32,871
I said I didn't need anything from him,

185
00:12:33,143 --> 00:12:35,611
and I was going
to raise this baby by myself.

186
00:12:35,896 --> 00:12:40,606
Anyway, he's going to be fine.
I'm late for a doctor's appointment.

187
00:12:40,984 --> 00:12:43,134
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I guess so.

188
00:12:43,403 --> 00:12:45,359
Can I take you to dinner tonight?

189
00:12:45,614 --> 00:12:47,923
Thank you, that would be nice.

190
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,191
I'll see you later.

191
00:12:51,912 --> 00:12:55,905
I can't stand these yuppie joints.
Some bozo went through the bathroom

192
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,844
correcting all the grammar
in the graffiti.

193
00:12:59,128 --> 00:13:01,596
Who can have
that much time on his hands?

194
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,199
Unbelievable.

195
00:13:03,423 --> 00:13:06,142
- It was Niles, wasn't it?
- I'll talk to him again.

196
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:12,019
It's open, Frasier.

197
00:13:14,017 --> 00:13:16,850
I'm sorry.
I probably should have called first.

198
00:13:17,146 --> 00:13:20,104
No, that's all right.
I'm just surprised to see you.

199
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,629
I'm surprised to be here myself.

200
00:13:25,988 --> 00:13:27,979
- Come in.
- Thanks.

201
00:13:30,868 --> 00:13:32,859
These are for you.

202
00:13:33,287 --> 00:13:37,405
There was a card, but it kind of
blew off on my way over. I rode my bike.

203
00:13:39,334 --> 00:13:41,325
- I acted like an idiot.
- It's OK.

204
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:46,024
No, it's not. I mean, when you told me,
all I could think about was myself

205
00:13:46,383 --> 00:13:50,058
and how it was going to affect me.
But once I calmed down,

206
00:13:51,722 --> 00:13:53,713
I started thinking about you

207
00:13:53,974 --> 00:13:55,407
and the...

208
00:13:55,642 --> 00:13:57,155
Baby.

209
00:13:57,394 --> 00:13:59,589
So, that's the other reason I'm here.

210
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:03,750
I'm not going to Paris.
I'm quitting school.

211
00:14:04,026 --> 00:14:06,381
I'm going to work
at the cafe full time.

212
00:14:07,446 --> 00:14:10,244
So you've come to tell me
you've lost your mind.

213
00:14:10,532 --> 00:14:13,524
No, I came here to ask you to marry me.

214
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:16,667
Oh, Rick...

215
00:14:16,914 --> 00:14:19,508
That's so wrong.

216
00:14:21,043 --> 00:14:23,034
Yeah, that's right.

217
00:14:23,295 --> 00:14:25,286
Roz, will you marry me?

218
00:14:25,547 --> 00:14:29,222
No, the proposal was fine.
It was absolutely lovely.

219
00:14:29,551 --> 00:14:32,987
- It's just that we can't...
- No, please. Don't say no yet.

220
00:14:33,305 --> 00:14:36,502
I have been thinking about this
all afternoon.

221
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:41,135
And I could fall in love with you.

222
00:14:42,773 --> 00:14:45,446
I could be a good husband,
a good father.

223
00:14:46,902 --> 00:14:51,180
Rick, that's the whole point
of being 20. You could be anything.

224
00:14:52,407 --> 00:14:56,366
I'm much older than you are.
I am things.

225
00:14:56,703 --> 00:14:59,934
I know what you're saying,
but I'm not too young for this.

226
00:15:00,249 --> 00:15:02,638
My mom was only 1 7 when she had me.

227
00:15:02,918 --> 00:15:06,149
Your mother's only 37 years old?

228
00:15:12,428 --> 00:15:15,943
And would you two hit it off.
I mean, you guys have a lot in common.

229
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:20,492
- Actually, you sort of even look alike.
- Stop right there.

230
00:15:21,395 --> 00:15:22,874
Listen,

231
00:15:23,105 --> 00:15:25,380
your proposal was

232
00:15:25,649 --> 00:15:27,719
so sweet.

233
00:15:27,985 --> 00:15:30,499
- It's my first one, actually.
- Mine, too.

234
00:15:31,989 --> 00:15:33,741
You're so...

235
00:15:33,991 --> 00:15:37,381
I hope that you can understand
why I can't possibly marry you.

236
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:41,495
When I get married,
it's going to be to someone I love,

237
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:44,179
and someone who loves me,

238
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:47,691
and someone who can legally
drink champagne at my wedding.

239
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:53,340
OK. I understand.

240
00:15:55,262 --> 00:15:57,617
- So is...?
- This is the sonogram picture.

241
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:59,960
I got it this morning. Right there.

242
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:02,944
Wow, that dot's my kid.

243
00:16:03,228 --> 00:16:05,742
No, that dot's just a dot.
That dot's your kid.

244
00:16:07,024 --> 00:16:10,334
- You can have it ifyou want.
- Thank you.

245
00:16:10,652 --> 00:16:14,884
I can send you photos, updates,
that sort of thing, ifyou like.

246
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,879
I would like that. Yeah, very much.

247
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:22,607
- Roz, are you sure...?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

248
00:16:23,457 --> 00:16:26,529
I think this is the right thing,
for you and for me.

249
00:16:28,712 --> 00:16:30,065
Now, go.

250
00:16:30,297 --> 00:16:35,576
Go to Paris. Go learn. Go have fun.
Just don't come back wearing a beret.

251
00:16:52,194 --> 00:16:54,185
- Take care ofyourself.
- You, too.

252
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:13,617
- I said go.
- But I just got here.

253
00:17:17,302 --> 00:17:19,293
I'm sorry, Frasier. Come in.

254
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:28,306
I ran into Rick in the hall.

255
00:17:28,564 --> 00:17:30,998
He asked me to marry him.

256
00:17:32,234 --> 00:17:35,544
- I said no.
- That was very sweet of him.

257
00:17:35,863 --> 00:17:40,459
- I was making tea. You want some?
- Yeah, thanks. With milk, please.

258
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:46,089
Well, you've had quite a day,
haven't you?

259
00:17:46,373 --> 00:17:48,523
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

260
00:17:50,085 --> 00:17:52,076
It's OK to not be fine.

261
00:17:52,337 --> 00:17:55,170
- Is it OK just to be OK?
- Yeah, sure.

262
00:17:56,842 --> 00:17:58,833
Thanks, Roz.

263
00:17:59,553 --> 00:18:01,703
This milk's expired.

264
00:18:01,972 --> 00:18:03,530
Whoa. It has.

265
00:18:03,766 --> 00:18:06,360
That's all right,
I can drink the tea straight.

266
00:18:07,478 --> 00:18:09,912
I had no idea I let this milk expire.

267
00:18:10,355 --> 00:18:12,346
It's really all right, Roz.

268
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:15,925
I can't take this.

269
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:18,834
How did I let this happen?

270
00:18:19,114 --> 00:18:22,743
Are we still talking about the milk?

271
00:18:23,076 --> 00:18:26,307
Don't you see? Milk is a staple.

272
00:18:26,622 --> 00:18:30,615
I let a staple go bad.
Good mothers don't let staples go bad.

273
00:18:30,959 --> 00:18:33,075
How can I be responsible for a child

274
00:18:33,337 --> 00:18:38,092
when I can't even keep fresh milk
in the house? Kids need milk.

275
00:18:38,842 --> 00:18:42,232
Roz, kids don't even drink milk
for the first year.

276
00:18:42,554 --> 00:18:44,545
See? I didn't even know that.

277
00:18:46,308 --> 00:18:48,822
I didn't know that either
until I was a parent.

278
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,990
Don't you understand?
I have to know everything.

279
00:18:53,315 --> 00:18:56,113
You could know half of everything,
about the milk.

280
00:18:56,401 --> 00:19:00,713
- Lilith could know about the booties.
- You never met Lilith, did you?

281
00:19:05,702 --> 00:19:09,775
Just forget the milk
and forget the tea and talk to me.

282
00:19:10,124 --> 00:19:14,561
I don't knowwhere to start. Everything
in my life is about to change.

283
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,639
My body, my love life...

284
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:22,474
Yes, but it's also going to change
in fantastic ways.

285
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:27,513
I remember the first night I brought
Frederick home from the hospital.

286
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:31,047
You put this tinything
into a tiny little bed,

287
00:19:33,856 --> 00:19:38,213
and you look around and you realise
that the entire house has changed.

288
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:43,657
I know. I want that.

289
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:46,065
But, God, the responsibility.

290
00:19:46,326 --> 00:19:49,284
Well, yes, but it's all worth it.

291
00:19:51,707 --> 00:19:55,017
You get to share your life
with a remarkable little creature

292
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,150
who only lives in the present,

293
00:19:59,423 --> 00:20:02,415
runs around naked
without the slightest bit of shame.

294
00:20:03,761 --> 00:20:07,390
Can entertain himself
just staring at a shiny object.

295
00:20:07,723 --> 00:20:11,716
- lsn't that wonderful?
- lsn't that Bulldog?

296
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,755
Well, technically, yes.

297
00:20:18,108 --> 00:20:23,501
Roz, I'm going to tell you something l
didn't find out until I became a father.

298
00:20:23,906 --> 00:20:27,455
You don't just love your children.

299
00:20:29,953 --> 00:20:31,944
You fall in love with them.

300
00:20:33,749 --> 00:20:38,459
It's that same rush, that same
overwhelming desire to see them,

301
00:20:38,837 --> 00:20:43,831
to hold them, bore other people to tears
with every detail about them.

302
00:20:45,385 --> 00:20:47,376
Oh, my God.

303
00:20:48,639 --> 00:20:50,630
I'm going to have a baby.

304
00:20:52,851 --> 00:20:56,161
Someone who's going to call out
for mom and it's gonna be me.

305
00:20:58,607 --> 00:21:03,397
I'm really scared.
What if I can't do this by myself?

306
00:21:03,779 --> 00:21:07,454
But, Roz, you're not all by yourself.

307
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,851
- I'm here.
- Thank you, Frasier.

308
00:21:12,579 --> 00:21:15,218
I'll be available
in whatever way you wish.

309
00:21:15,499 --> 00:21:19,458
From taking you out to dinner tonight
to that moment in the delivery room

310
00:21:19,795 --> 00:21:24,471
when you saywelcome to the world,
little Jimmy or little Sally or...

311
00:21:25,509 --> 00:21:27,704
dare I hope, little Frasier.

312
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:31,280
- I think I'm going to be sick.
- I got carried away.

313
00:21:31,598 --> 00:21:35,227
- No, I mean I'm going to hurl.
- Oh, dear God. I'll wait here.
