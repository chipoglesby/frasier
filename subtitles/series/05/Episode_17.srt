1
00:00:09,625 --> 00:00:11,616
That's it fortoday, Seattle.

2
00:00:11,877 --> 00:00:16,393
This is Doctor Frasier Crane wishing you
good day and good mental health.

3
00:00:17,507 --> 00:00:20,419
Move it.
Person waiting for the booth here.

4
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:24,075
That is not amusing in the men's room.
It's not amusing now.

5
00:00:24,389 --> 00:00:27,142
- All ready then, Bulldog?
- What are you two doing?

6
00:00:27,434 --> 00:00:30,267
We're recording an ad for a new sponsor.

7
00:00:30,562 --> 00:00:34,032
By the way, Roz, baby or no baby,
your ass has never looked better.

8
00:00:34,358 --> 00:00:35,347
Shut up.

9
00:00:37,194 --> 00:00:39,708
- How sick is that?
- He's just being Bulldog.

10
00:00:39,988 --> 00:00:41,979
No, that I liked hearing it.

11
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:46,465
- Hi, I'm Bulldog Brisco.
- And I'm Gil Chesterton.

12
00:00:46,787 --> 00:00:49,096
When Bulldog and I are out together...

13
00:00:49,373 --> 00:00:53,161
- Whether it's at the opera.
- Or rooting our Mariners to victory.

14
00:00:53,502 --> 00:00:55,493
We always round out the evening

15
00:00:55,754 --> 00:00:58,314
with a nice, relaxing cup
of Happy Dreams Tea.

16
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:02,185
We're making some right now.
How many lumps do you like, Gil?

17
00:01:02,511 --> 00:01:03,500
One, please.

18
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,870
Ouch! Gets me every time.

19
00:01:06,974 --> 00:01:12,207
Happy Dreams Tea. One cup, you'll have
happy dreams the whole night through.

20
00:01:12,604 --> 00:01:14,196
Yes. Perfect. One take.

21
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:16,999
My "ouch"
could be a bit more convincing.

22
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:19,604
We'll splice that in later.

23
00:01:21,572 --> 00:01:24,609
- What was that?
- It's the new station manager's idea.

24
00:01:24,908 --> 00:01:27,900
He's getting on-air talent
to record commercials for sponsors.

25
00:01:28,203 --> 00:01:31,240
Are you disappointed
he didn't ask you to do it?

26
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:35,294
About as disappointed as when
that hypnotist picked them to come up

27
00:01:35,627 --> 00:01:37,936
and groom each other like monkeys.

28
00:01:38,213 --> 00:01:43,287
Yeah, you really lucked out. He didn't
make you do anything silly. No, sir.

29
00:01:43,677 --> 00:01:44,951
Roz.

30
00:01:45,804 --> 00:01:47,840
Daphne, what're you doing here?

31
00:01:48,098 --> 00:01:50,976
Dr Crane's car's in the shop,
so I'm a chauffeur.

32
00:01:51,268 --> 00:01:55,022
- There's a rally on Pike Street.
- What sort of rally?

33
00:01:55,355 --> 00:01:58,427
They're trying to save a bookstore
from being torn down.

34
00:01:58,734 --> 00:02:00,565
Not Hirsch and Sons?

35
00:02:00,819 --> 00:02:05,335
- They want to build a strip mall.
- That's a Seattle landmark.

36
00:02:05,699 --> 00:02:08,133
My God, Mark Twain gave a reading there.

37
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:13,438
I know that place. I had a boyfriend who
liked to make out in the occult section.

38
00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:19,248
I'm terribly upset about this.
We'll go down there and join that rally.

39
00:02:19,588 --> 00:02:20,703
Good for you.

40
00:02:20,923 --> 00:02:25,439
I refuse to stand by while some bully
rides roughshod over the little people.

41
00:02:25,802 --> 00:02:29,477
- I don't want to go to a rally.
- Tough luck. You're the chauffeur.

42
00:02:43,195 --> 00:02:47,234
This is rather exciting. I never
thought you to be the protest kind.

43
00:02:47,574 --> 00:02:50,691
I was quite the activist
in my college days.

44
00:02:50,994 --> 00:02:53,827
Nothing like throwing in
with a band ofyoung rebels

45
00:02:54,122 --> 00:02:56,192
thumbing their noses at convention.

46
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:59,609
Did you go for the whole package?
Long hair, beads?

47
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,357
No, I did have a pair of psychedelic
suspenders that raised an eyebrow.

48
00:03:04,716 --> 00:03:07,150
This seems good, don't you think?

49
00:03:09,012 --> 00:03:13,483
Hey, this is great. Hey, look,
everybody, it's Dr Frasier Crane.

50
00:03:15,936 --> 00:03:17,574
Hello. Good to see you.

51
00:03:17,813 --> 00:03:22,443
- Would you like to say a few words?
- Well, all right. I'll keep it simple.

52
00:03:22,818 --> 00:03:27,096
Be strong, people.
Our cause is just. To the barricades.

53
00:03:29,283 --> 00:03:31,433
This is sort offun, isn't it?

54
00:03:31,702 --> 00:03:34,091
People, this is your final warning.

55
00:03:34,371 --> 00:03:36,726
- What's that?
- It's the police.

56
00:03:36,999 --> 00:03:39,991
Disperse now, or we will take action.

57
00:03:40,294 --> 00:03:44,173
- What do you they mean by that?
- We're not going anywhere, are we?

58
00:03:44,506 --> 00:03:48,704
- Are they talking about a jail thing?
- Who knows? Exciting, isn't it?

59
00:03:49,052 --> 00:03:51,725
They'll have to drag us out of here.

60
00:03:52,014 --> 00:03:55,086
They don't actually
drag people away anymore, do they?

61
00:03:55,392 --> 00:03:58,748
Cos they're too afraid to arrest us,
aren't they?

62
00:03:59,062 --> 00:04:01,656
Now you're just provoking them.

63
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:04,534
All right, people, you had your warning.

64
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,288
They weren't kidding.

65
00:04:09,573 --> 00:04:13,009
There go
the first lucky martyrs to our cause.

66
00:04:15,204 --> 00:04:17,764
At the rate
they're dragging people away,

67
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,715
there'll be nobody left to protest.
I better get reinforcements.

68
00:04:22,044 --> 00:04:24,717
Dr Crane, where are you going?

69
00:04:25,005 --> 00:04:26,996
Solidarity, brothers.

70
00:04:41,647 --> 00:04:44,036
- Hello, Niles.
- I hope you're free tonight.

71
00:04:44,316 --> 00:04:48,150
I just secured a table at the most
exclusive new restaurant in Seattle.

72
00:04:48,487 --> 00:04:50,876
- I'm not in the mood.
- At least hear me out.

73
00:04:51,156 --> 00:04:54,034
This place is the hottest new thing
in fusion cuisine.

74
00:04:54,326 --> 00:04:56,601
What cuisines are being fused?

75
00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:02,740
Polynesian and Scandinavian.
It's called Mahalo Valhalla.

76
00:05:05,629 --> 00:05:09,622
Perhaps there's a reason God
put those two countries so far apart.

77
00:05:10,008 --> 00:05:15,162
My gourmet newsletter gave three and
a halfwhisks to their coconut herring.

78
00:05:17,766 --> 00:05:21,236
I'm sorry, Niles.
Tonight's just a bad night.

79
00:05:21,562 --> 00:05:25,919
Daphne's been hauled down to jail.
Dad's down there trying to bail her out.

80
00:05:26,275 --> 00:05:29,506
- What?
- They should be home any minute.

81
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:34,177
It's just that she was down at that
rally for Hirsch and Sons bookstore.

82
00:05:34,533 --> 00:05:37,127
The worst part of it
is I convinced her to go.

83
00:05:37,411 --> 00:05:42,280
When they started hauling people away,
I chickened out and ran.

84
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:47,398
- You left her there?
- It was a shameful performance.

85
00:05:48,338 --> 00:05:51,569
But I did clear that hedge
in front of Emerson's Funeral Home

86
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:54,398
Iike a Kentucky show horse, but...

87
00:05:57,097 --> 00:05:59,736
What has happened to me, Niles?

88
00:06:00,017 --> 00:06:04,135
I used to be so courageous,
to fight for things.

89
00:06:06,023 --> 00:06:09,618
When did I become so middle-aged,
so timid?

90
00:06:09,943 --> 00:06:14,459
Don't be so hard on yourself. We all
get a bit more cautious as we get older.

91
00:06:14,823 --> 00:06:18,941
Not me. God, it was only five years ago
I packed up my whole life in Boston,

92
00:06:19,286 --> 00:06:23,484
moved across the country to start over.
That took real courage.

93
00:06:23,832 --> 00:06:26,392
Now, the biggest risk I take
is saying to Dad,

94
00:06:26,668 --> 00:06:29,865
"Let's go out to dinner.
You pick the restaurant."

95
00:06:32,174 --> 00:06:35,211
Daphne, it's so good
to have you home safe and sound.

96
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:36,943
Sod off.

97
00:06:37,179 --> 00:06:40,933
- She's a little mad at you.
- Yes, thank you, Dad.

98
00:06:41,266 --> 00:06:42,665
Daphne,

99
00:06:42,893 --> 00:06:46,488
I am so sorry. I feel just terrible.

100
00:06:46,813 --> 00:06:49,646
As you should.
You left me handcuffed and helpless.

101
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:53,901
Ifyou're ever in that position again,
be sure to call on me.

102
00:06:58,951 --> 00:07:01,146
For help.

103
00:07:01,411 --> 00:07:04,483
Thank you, Dr Crane.
Shame on you, Dr Crane.

104
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:07,862
Why can't you be more like Dr Crane?

105
00:07:08,168 --> 00:07:10,762
It took me six hours to get her out.

106
00:07:11,046 --> 00:07:13,844
In my days
cops could count on a few perks.

107
00:07:14,132 --> 00:07:18,330
No speeding tickets. Get your friends
out of jail fast. It's all gone to hell.

108
00:07:18,679 --> 00:07:20,829
Let's hope they never do away with that

109
00:07:21,098 --> 00:07:24,488
"all jewellery up for grabs
in the morgue" policy.

110
00:07:26,937 --> 00:07:30,896
I'm not letting this dinner reservation
go to waste. Frasier?

111
00:07:31,233 --> 00:07:36,353
- Thanks anyway, Niles.
- Very well. Dad, what about you?

112
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:40,299
Maybe I will come
and get a bite with you.

113
00:07:40,576 --> 00:07:44,774
Sitting around six hours in that
station house, I could eat anything.

114
00:07:45,122 --> 00:07:47,192
- Let's go, then.
- I can't wait.

115
00:07:48,292 --> 00:07:50,248
Where are we going, anyway?

116
00:07:51,461 --> 00:07:55,420
Hello? Yes, I'd like
to order a large pizza.

117
00:07:55,757 --> 00:07:58,191
What toppings? Just a second.

118
00:07:59,511 --> 00:08:01,502
Dad, what do you want on your pizza?

119
00:08:02,848 --> 00:08:04,964
- Pepperoni.
- Pepperoni, please.

120
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:10,223
We've been fighting a lot
and she's neverin the mood for sex.

121
00:08:10,564 --> 00:08:12,555
I think she's having an affair.

122
00:08:12,816 --> 00:08:15,091
Let's not give in to paranoia.

123
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,434
Just because your wife is avoiding sex
doesn't mean she's being unfaithful.

124
00:08:20,824 --> 00:08:23,384
You said
you haven't been talking lately.

125
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:27,175
Why don't you try re-opening
the lines of communication tonight

126
00:08:27,497 --> 00:08:30,773
by surprising herwith a nice,
romantic dinner?

127
00:08:31,084 --> 00:08:34,554
Tonight's no good. She's working late
on herboss'boat again.

128
00:08:38,008 --> 00:08:40,522
But tomorrow's OK.
Thanks, Dr Crane.

129
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,837
Roz, what do you say we turn things over
to our eye on the sky,

130
00:08:48,143 --> 00:08:50,338
Chopper Dave, with the traffic report?

131
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:55,495
I want to introduce you
to our new station manager, Kenny Daly.

132
00:08:55,817 --> 00:08:56,966
It's a pleasure.

133
00:08:57,194 --> 00:09:01,267
No, it's my pleasure.
I have to say, I'm just a huge fan.

134
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:06,943
I only had this reaction once before.
You ever hear of Norman Mailer?

135
00:09:07,287 --> 00:09:08,606
Of course, the author.

136
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:12,584
No, I'm talking about
the drive-time guy, worked out of Tampa?

137
00:09:12,918 --> 00:09:17,275
"Norman in the Mornin"'.
So funny you'd pray for traffic.

138
00:09:17,631 --> 00:09:23,422
I'll try to catch him the next time
I'm in Tampa. In the mornin'.

139
00:09:24,471 --> 00:09:27,224
- It's been great meeting you.
- You, too.

140
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:31,437
I got a call
from the Happy Dreams Tea people.

141
00:09:31,728 --> 00:09:36,085
They had spots scheduled for your
first hour and you forgot to read them.

142
00:09:36,441 --> 00:09:39,797
I didn't forget. I looked at the copy
and I couldn't read it.

143
00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:41,864
Why not?

144
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:44,753
Well, just listen to this.

145
00:09:45,033 --> 00:09:48,662
"One cup of Happy Dreams Tea and
you'll have happy dreams all night."

146
00:09:48,996 --> 00:09:52,306
Dreams are a by-product
of unresolved emotion.

147
00:09:52,624 --> 00:09:55,297
No tea can promise happy dreams.

148
00:09:56,461 --> 00:09:58,656
I totally get that.

149
00:09:59,214 --> 00:10:02,604
Our ad revenues are down
and they're a major new sponsor.

150
00:10:02,926 --> 00:10:05,884
I promised them that you'd read
the ads this hour.

151
00:10:06,179 --> 00:10:09,649
As a psychiatrist, I can't.
They promise something impossible.

152
00:10:09,975 --> 00:10:14,924
Now I understand. What if
we just think of it more as a slogan?

153
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:18,067
But it's not a slogan.
If l, as a doctor, read it,

154
00:10:18,358 --> 00:10:23,751
- it sounds like medical advice.
- OK. Now, totally get it.

155
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,556
Instead of saying Dr Frasier Crane,
don't say "doctor".

156
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:35,069
I'm not making myself clear here. Let's
try this. I will never read this copy.

157
00:10:36,418 --> 00:10:40,570
This is the part of my job I hate.
You take a stand like that

158
00:10:40,923 --> 00:10:44,836
and I totally respect it, by the way,
and you force my hand.

159
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:50,376
That's our biggest sponsor. Unless
you go on the air and read that ad,

160
00:10:50,766 --> 00:10:53,155
I have to fire you.

161
00:10:54,394 --> 00:10:55,793
Ten seconds, Frasier.

162
00:10:59,233 --> 00:11:03,624
I didn't realise you felt so strongly
about it. I guess I have no choice.

163
00:11:03,987 --> 00:11:06,581
Thanks, Dr Crane. What a relief.

164
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,359
Hello, Seattle.

165
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:21,213
The people who know me best will not be
surprised by what I'm about to tell you.

166
00:11:21,588 --> 00:11:24,466
I am not a man

167
00:11:24,758 --> 00:11:27,226
who betrays his principles.

168
00:11:27,511 --> 00:11:29,820
I am not a man
who misleads his listeners

169
00:11:30,097 --> 00:11:33,373
and I am not a man
who will shrink from a fight.

170
00:11:33,684 --> 00:11:37,199
Today, I find myself in a fight
over the content of my show.

171
00:11:37,521 --> 00:11:40,593
But rather than truckle to the forces
of commercialism,

172
00:11:40,899 --> 00:11:44,687
I've decided to take a stand
on principle, even it means...

173
00:11:46,321 --> 00:11:49,757
- I'm not on the air, am l?
- No. He put on the Best of Crane.

174
00:11:50,659 --> 00:11:53,890
- How much did I get out?
- Well, let's see.

175
00:11:54,204 --> 00:11:58,322
People who know me best will not be
surprised by what I'm about to tell you.

176
00:11:58,667 --> 00:12:00,976
I am not a man...

177
00:12:09,052 --> 00:12:10,041
Perfect.

178
00:12:15,183 --> 00:12:16,901
So they fired you?

179
00:12:17,144 --> 00:12:22,013
Yes. And I must say it feels good
to take a stand like this.

180
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,358
I feel like my old self again. I'll tell
you one thing, I don't envy Kenny.

181
00:12:26,695 --> 00:12:29,334
Feeling the cold stares
ofthe other employees

182
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:32,812
because he's fired
the station's most popular personality.

183
00:12:33,118 --> 00:12:36,155
He fired Tooty the Story Lady, too?

184
00:12:36,997 --> 00:12:38,635
Very funny, Niles.

185
00:12:38,874 --> 00:12:42,867
Who would have thought that getting
fired can make one feel so alive?

186
00:12:45,672 --> 00:12:49,870
What do you want?
Another staring contest, I suppose?

187
00:12:50,219 --> 00:12:53,370
Well, you picked the wrong day for that.

188
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:00,266
Take that.

189
00:13:01,188 --> 00:13:05,306
- Frasier, what are you doing home?
- Dad, brace yourself.

190
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:09,405
The station fired me. So you'll
be seeing me this time every day.

191
00:13:09,738 --> 00:13:12,491
That's terrible.

192
00:13:12,783 --> 00:13:16,492
- I assume you mean the firing part.
- Well, yeah.

193
00:13:16,828 --> 00:13:18,420
So what happened?

194
00:13:18,664 --> 00:13:23,454
They asked me to violate a principle
I believe in and I refused.

195
00:13:23,835 --> 00:13:26,349
I'm proud ofyou.
What did theywantyou to do?

196
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:30,782
There's this product and theywanted me
to say it gives people happy dreams.

197
00:13:31,134 --> 00:13:32,328
And?

198
00:13:33,262 --> 00:13:36,015
I couldn't make a claim like that.

199
00:13:36,306 --> 00:13:39,218
All commercials promise things
they can't deliver.

200
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:40,507
That may be...

201
00:13:40,727 --> 00:13:42,718
Like cologne driving women wild.

202
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:46,370
I used it all my life and never
had a single woman come on to me.

203
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:50,924
- Except that year I worked in Vice.
- Yes, I understand.

204
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:54,955
- But that wasn't about cologne.
- Yes, I understand.

205
00:13:55,284 --> 00:13:57,923
- They were hookers.
- I realise that!

206
00:14:04,251 --> 00:14:08,130
Frasier, don't be angry with me,
but I do have one theory.

207
00:14:08,463 --> 00:14:12,172
I was wondering when you'd get around
to that so, allow me.

208
00:14:12,509 --> 00:14:16,468
I was so ashamed of my chickening out
at the rally

209
00:14:16,805 --> 00:14:20,115
that I grabbed at the first fight
that came my way.

210
00:14:20,434 --> 00:14:23,392
It turned out to be the wrong fight
and I lost my job.

211
00:14:23,687 --> 00:14:26,360
So if you follow that theory
through to the end,

212
00:14:26,648 --> 00:14:29,879
this heady feeling of euphoria
I'm experiencing right now

213
00:14:30,194 --> 00:14:33,266
is nothing more
than a deep-seated denial.

214
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:36,245
- So have you considered it?
- Not for a second.

215
00:14:41,872 --> 00:14:42,861
Hello.

216
00:14:43,081 --> 00:14:45,390
I know I'm the last person
you want to see,

217
00:14:45,667 --> 00:14:49,103
but since I fired you,
I haven't been able to eat or sleep.

218
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:51,616
Kenny, it's only been
an hour and a half.

219
00:14:55,594 --> 00:14:57,789
Well, I'm a napper.

220
00:14:59,181 --> 00:15:00,773
I was wrong.

221
00:15:01,016 --> 00:15:05,885
I just fired a man who was willing
to go to the mat for his principles.

222
00:15:06,271 --> 00:15:10,059
What does that say about mine? Before
I go on, have you had any job offers?

223
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,834
He's had four. Shut up.

224
00:15:13,111 --> 00:15:15,102
I'm still technically available.

225
00:15:15,364 --> 00:15:19,403
I'd like you to come back to work.
I'm calling the Happy Dreams people

226
00:15:19,743 --> 00:15:22,576
and telling them
you're uncomfortable with their ads.

227
00:15:22,871 --> 00:15:25,465
At KACL, the talent comes first.

228
00:15:25,749 --> 00:15:29,298
Well, what can I say but...
see you tomorrow.

229
00:15:29,628 --> 00:15:31,664
This is so great. I'm so relieved.

230
00:15:31,922 --> 00:15:35,073
Can I buy you a beer
just to show we have no hard feelings?

231
00:15:35,384 --> 00:15:39,900
I would love that. As long as
I don't have to endorse it afterwards.

232
00:15:40,264 --> 00:15:43,654
I guess I had that one coming.
Nice meeting you.

233
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:49,777
Good afternoon, Seattle,
this is Dr Frasier Crane

234
00:15:50,065 --> 00:15:52,625
and I would like to begin today
by apologising

235
00:15:52,901 --> 00:15:55,893
for my abrupt departure
from the airwaves yesterday.

236
00:15:56,196 --> 00:16:01,111
You see, I was embroiled
in a conflict with the management.

237
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:03,768
I'm happy to report it's been resolved,

238
00:16:04,037 --> 00:16:06,676
thanks to the efforts
of our new station manager,

239
00:16:06,957 --> 00:16:09,676
a courageous and principled
young man, Ken Daly.

240
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:15,876
I won't bore you with all the details,
but he took on the big guys and won.

241
00:16:17,885 --> 00:16:21,924
Anyway, I apologise
for our brief interruption yesterday

242
00:16:22,264 --> 00:16:25,859
and I assure you that today's
will be even briefer.

243
00:16:26,184 --> 00:16:28,618
Roz, let's go to commercial.

244
00:16:30,188 --> 00:16:34,864
- Kenny, what's going on?
- It's the darndest thing. I got fired.

245
00:16:35,235 --> 00:16:37,465
What? Well, how did that happen?

246
00:16:37,738 --> 00:16:40,536
I told the sponsors
you wouldn't be reading their ads.

247
00:16:40,824 --> 00:16:44,260
Then I'm called into Mr Martin's office
in the Black Tower.

248
00:16:44,578 --> 00:16:47,456
I said sponsors
are easier to replace than talent.

249
00:16:47,748 --> 00:16:50,387
He said I was easier to replace
than anybody.

250
00:16:50,667 --> 00:16:53,784
Then he called me
a pinhead and took my Coke away.

251
00:16:56,131 --> 00:16:57,803
That's terrible.

252
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:01,759
Kenny, I can't help feeling
that this is all my fault.

253
00:17:02,095 --> 00:17:05,610
These things happen. If I've got
to get fired sticking up for someone,

254
00:17:05,933 --> 00:17:07,924
I'm honoured it was for you.

255
00:17:08,185 --> 00:17:12,417
At least now I'll have time to finish
building that nursery. We're expecting.

256
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:16,705
There's my wife now. She'll
get a kick out ofthis coincidence.

257
00:17:17,027 --> 00:17:19,541
Me and her getting fired
in the same week.

258
00:17:19,821 --> 00:17:21,812
- May l?
- Of course.

259
00:17:25,285 --> 00:17:29,403
- We have got to get Kenny's job back.
- How are we supposed to do that?

260
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:32,626
We'll just round up all the talent,
go down to Mr Martin

261
00:17:32,918 --> 00:17:34,954
and demand that he rehire Kenny.

262
00:17:35,212 --> 00:17:38,204
He owns the station.
We can't give him an ultimatum.

263
00:17:38,507 --> 00:17:41,783
It's not an ultimatum.
We'll appeal to his sense of decency.

264
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:44,085
Kenny went to bat for me.

265
00:17:44,346 --> 00:17:48,134
Kenny hasn't asked for our help.
For all we know, he'll be fine.

266
00:17:48,475 --> 00:17:50,989
How do you like that?
She's having twins.

267
00:17:52,938 --> 00:17:55,975
Heck of a time
for me to lose my insurance.

268
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:58,266
Well, you guys take care.

269
00:18:09,246 --> 00:18:14,604
Together we can do this. The important
thing is to present a united front.

270
00:18:15,002 --> 00:18:17,118
What is the matter with you people?

271
00:18:17,379 --> 00:18:18,778
We're frightened.

272
00:18:19,006 --> 00:18:20,997
- Ofwhat?
- Of everything.

273
00:18:21,258 --> 00:18:26,127
We're in the Black Tower. Those lobby
guards must have been seven feet tall.

274
00:18:26,513 --> 00:18:29,630
And that metal detector
we had to go through was scary.

275
00:18:29,933 --> 00:18:33,323
It was even scarier
finding out Gil wears an anklet.

276
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:35,840
Get off the elevator, all of you!

277
00:18:36,106 --> 00:18:39,496
I'm ashamed of you.
Intimidated by a building.

278
00:18:40,569 --> 00:18:45,404
We're here for Kenny, the man who wants
to start KACL daycare, Roz.

279
00:18:45,782 --> 00:18:50,060
The man who approved the airbrushing
charges on your publicity photos, Gil.

280
00:18:50,412 --> 00:18:54,291
And, Tooty, who was it that just
doubled the Story Time puppet budget?

281
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:58,413
I know Kenny's a great guy
but I met Joe Martin once.

282
00:18:58,754 --> 00:19:04,590
He was a very scary man
with eyes as cold as a winter night...

283
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:07,001
All right, Tooty.

284
00:19:08,639 --> 00:19:11,073
Mr Martin. Hello.

285
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:14,820
- Do you have an appointment?
- My name is Dr Frasier Crane.

286
00:19:15,145 --> 00:19:17,215
I am here with some talent from KACL.

287
00:19:17,481 --> 00:19:20,439
My producer, Roz Doyle.
Gil Chesterton, food critic.

288
00:19:20,734 --> 00:19:23,567
Bob Brisco, sports.
Tooty Feingold, the Story Lady.

289
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:28,174
Ray Schmidt, the Green Grocer
and Miss Judy, arts and crafts.

290
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:30,764
Sorry, Judy,
I don't know your last name.

291
00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:33,106
I'm in the middle of a board meeting.

292
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:38,207
This will only take a moment.
This morning you fired Kenny Daly,

293
00:19:38,585 --> 00:19:41,497
a wonderful station manager
and a man of integrity.

294
00:19:41,797 --> 00:19:44,709
That is a very rare quality
in this industry.

295
00:19:45,008 --> 00:19:47,602
You fire all the Kenny Dalys,
what are you left with?

296
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:51,037
A bunch of sycophants and yes-men.
Am I right?

297
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:58,560
Now it would be a great risk
to hire Kenny back.

298
00:19:58,939 --> 00:20:04,809
But a man that stops taking risks
in life pays a very dear price indeed.

299
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:09,753
I know whereof I speak. And I can see
that I'm getting through to you,

300
00:20:10,117 --> 00:20:14,872
so let me just leave you
with one last question.

301
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:19,684
What kind of radio station do you want?

302
00:20:20,043 --> 00:20:25,834
Dr Crane, that is the exact question
I've been asking myself

303
00:20:26,258 --> 00:20:30,217
all through that board meeting.
As you know, our ratings are down,

304
00:20:30,554 --> 00:20:33,626
and the number crunchers in there
think they can fix it

305
00:20:33,932 --> 00:20:38,005
by sucking up to our sponsors.
Well, that's not what I think.

306
00:20:38,353 --> 00:20:41,868
Thanks to you,
I'm going with my gut on this one.

307
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:44,658
- You bet you are.
- I'm going to go in there

308
00:20:44,943 --> 00:20:47,980
and tell them we're doing it my way.
No more talk.

309
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,508
Exactly. Action.

310
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:55,610
No, no more talk radio. From this moment
on, the station is all Latino music,

311
00:20:56,038 --> 00:20:58,188
all the time.

312
00:20:58,457 --> 00:21:00,652
- I beg your pardon?
- Thank you, Dr Crane.

313
00:21:00,918 --> 00:21:03,432
I'm going back to my roots.

314
00:21:03,712 --> 00:21:07,591
I may have walked out ofthat meeting
Joe Martin, corporate sell-out,

315
00:21:07,925 --> 00:21:12,999
but I'm walking back in José Martinez,
risk taker.

316
00:21:19,603 --> 00:21:22,356
- What just happened?
- You just got us all fired.

317
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:25,367
- What did you say?
- All right, don't panic!
