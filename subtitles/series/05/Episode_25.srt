1
00:00:11,727 --> 00:00:14,719
-Oh!Easy.
-Sorry.Yourneckistight.

2
00:00:15,022 --> 00:00:18,935
-It'sbeenatensecoupleofdays.
-Holidays'll dothattoyou.

3
00:00:19,276 --> 00:00:21,471
This has beentheworstChristmas ever.

4
00:00:22,821 --> 00:00:24,812
Itall started yesterday.

5
00:00:26,283 --> 00:00:30,754
The only part about Christmas I don't
like is how quickly it's all over.

6
00:00:31,121 --> 00:00:36,195
Yes. Come December 26th,
it's all just a memory,

7
00:00:36,585 --> 00:00:40,260
with nothing but your light
decorating touch to remind us.

8
00:00:42,674 --> 00:00:44,471
Afternoon, all.

9
00:00:45,218 --> 00:00:49,052
That's awfully dangerous, Daphne,
standing under that mistletoe.

10
00:00:49,389 --> 00:00:51,459
That's enough eggnog, Niles.

11
00:00:51,725 --> 00:00:56,276
The oddest thing just happened. I was
walking past that church on Chestnut,

12
00:00:56,647 --> 00:01:00,435
and Eddie assumed we were going inside.

13
00:01:00,776 --> 00:01:03,244
He did the same thing with me yesterday.

14
00:01:03,528 --> 00:01:07,601
- Any idea why he'd do that, Mr Crane?
- He's always doing weird things.

15
00:01:07,949 --> 00:01:11,862
Yesterday we were taking our bath
together and he spent 15 minutes

16
00:01:12,204 --> 00:01:16,914
pushing the soap around with his nose
like an otter. Weird.

17
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:23,818
Yes. If he gets anyweirder,
we'll have to send Eddie to a home.

18
00:01:24,216 --> 00:01:26,776
I'm off. I have
all my Christmas shopping to do.

19
00:01:27,052 --> 00:01:30,328
- All of it?
- I'm not going to settle this year.

20
00:01:30,639 --> 00:01:33,870
I want my gifts
to be remembered and cherished.

21
00:01:34,184 --> 00:01:37,699
Nothing is cherished quite so much
as the gift of laughter.

22
00:01:38,021 --> 00:01:42,458
You'll have to buy that Highway Patrol
bloopers tape yourself.

23
00:01:42,818 --> 00:01:47,653
You can't drink that that way.
The first mistake in eggnog preparation

24
00:01:48,657 --> 00:01:51,808
is failing to garnish it properly
with a dash of nutmeg.

25
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:54,610
There we are.

26
00:01:57,916 --> 00:02:01,306
The second mistake is placing
the paprika next to the nutmeg

27
00:02:01,628 --> 00:02:03,619
on the spice shelf.

28
00:02:05,215 --> 00:02:09,174
- Mr Crane, are you all right?
- Yes, we're fine, Daphne.

29
00:02:10,429 --> 00:02:13,865
I'm fine. Frasier, before you go,
can I talk to you for a minute?

30
00:02:14,182 --> 00:02:17,538
- Sure. What is it?
- What Daphne was talking about,

31
00:02:17,853 --> 00:02:21,448
there is a reason Eddie knows that
church. I've been taking him there.

32
00:02:21,773 --> 00:02:24,810
I guess the family
that bathes together prays together.

33
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:28,819
There's this priest, Father Curtis.
He got to know Eddie in the park

34
00:02:29,156 --> 00:02:31,875
and wanted to use him
for the Christmas pageant.

35
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:35,231
Next thing I know,
he's roped me in to play a shepherd.

36
00:02:35,537 --> 00:02:40,406
Then Dutch gets bronchitis
and I get promoted to a wise man.

37
00:02:40,792 --> 00:02:44,705
Is there a point to this story
looming somewhere on the horizon?

38
00:02:45,047 --> 00:02:48,084
As a wise man, I have to sing a song
but this song's a killer.

39
00:02:48,383 --> 00:02:50,738
I'm going to humiliate myself.

40
00:02:51,011 --> 00:02:53,809
- You just need a rehearsal.
- You think that'd help?

41
00:02:54,097 --> 00:02:57,134
Sure. You're a good singer.
We'll start around eight?

42
00:02:57,434 --> 00:02:59,629
I am a good singer.

43
00:02:59,895 --> 00:03:04,127
Remember those old family picnics when
I used to belt out What's New, Pussycat?

44
00:03:06,902 --> 00:03:10,338
We'll start around seven then.
Niles, hold the elevator.

45
00:03:13,492 --> 00:03:17,405
Boys, this is that song
I was telling you about. O Holy Night.

46
00:03:17,746 --> 00:03:20,180
- Do you know it?
- Of course. It's a classic.

47
00:03:20,457 --> 00:03:22,846
It all builds to that one glorious note.

48
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,268
Yes, that's the note I can't hit.

49
00:03:32,552 --> 00:03:36,431
I practise it and Eddie ends up
burying his head under the pillow.

50
00:03:37,224 --> 00:03:38,543
We'll get you there.

51
00:03:38,767 --> 00:03:41,884
I want it finished
before Daphne gets back.

52
00:03:42,187 --> 00:03:44,747
If she knows about this,
she'll come to the pageant

53
00:03:45,023 --> 00:03:47,014
and I'm nervous enough as it is.

54
00:03:47,275 --> 00:03:49,505
Let's just see
what we have to work with.

55
00:03:49,778 --> 00:03:52,338
Why don't you start here?

56
00:03:52,614 --> 00:03:55,412
And I want to hear you
really attack the note.

57
00:04:15,137 --> 00:04:18,254
Sometimes the note
sees the attack coming and retreats.

58
00:04:20,309 --> 00:04:24,621
Shut up! This bozo upstairs, he bangs
on the floor every time I start to sing.

59
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:28,734
Ignore him. There is another
vocal exercise I remember.

60
00:04:29,067 --> 00:04:31,979
It was useful to me
when I was singing Colonel Fairfax

61
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:34,554
in Yeoman ofthe Guard.

62
00:04:34,823 --> 00:04:39,772
You distract yourselfwith a physical
exercise, thus freeing the voice.

63
00:04:40,162 --> 00:04:43,120
You hit one note,
then you slide up the octave

64
00:04:43,415 --> 00:04:46,612
as you descend slowly
into a crouched position. Observe.

65
00:04:52,799 --> 00:04:54,517
You see, it works.

66
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,957
That's very interesting.
I wonder if the reverse is true.

67
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:08,872
Try it, Dad.

68
00:05:09,107 --> 00:05:13,544
No, I'm afraid with three of us
doing it, it might look stupid.

69
00:05:13,904 --> 00:05:15,781
Your problem may be psychological.

70
00:05:16,031 --> 00:05:18,784
No, you're convinced
you can't hit this note.

71
00:05:19,076 --> 00:05:20,873
I convinced the guy upstairs, too.

72
00:05:21,119 --> 00:05:24,236
Niles may be right.
You need reinforcement. Try it again.

73
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:27,497
Try to eliminate any negative thoughts.

74
00:05:27,876 --> 00:05:31,664
All right, let's go. All right here,
Niles. "Fall on your knees", OK?

75
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,779
You've got it, Dad.

76
00:05:38,428 --> 00:05:40,419
I hear sweet music.

77
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:47,570
Something's divine.

78
00:05:50,774 --> 00:05:52,207
A star is born.

79
00:05:53,527 --> 00:05:55,518
Bring it home now.

80
00:06:02,661 --> 00:06:04,253
Shut up.

81
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:12,338
- Your shoulders are awfully tight.
- It's been a stressful few days.

82
00:06:12,713 --> 00:06:15,227
- I'd be happy to listen.
- Oh, no.

83
00:06:17,467 --> 00:06:21,904
Well, it started yesterday.
I had something on my mind.

84
00:06:23,098 --> 00:06:25,851
Lucky for me,
Dr Crane's brother was over.

85
00:06:26,143 --> 00:06:28,373
He's always been
such a good friend to me.

86
00:06:30,564 --> 00:06:32,395
- Afternoon, all.
- Hello, Daphne.

87
00:06:32,649 --> 00:06:36,198
That's awfully dangerous
standing under that mistletoe.

88
00:06:36,528 --> 00:06:40,601
- A piece could fall into your eye.
- Let me freshen your drink.

89
00:06:40,949 --> 00:06:43,827
Thank you, Dr Crane.
The oddest thing just happened.

90
00:06:44,119 --> 00:06:46,872
I was walking Eddie
past that church on Chestnut

91
00:06:47,164 --> 00:06:49,883
and Eddie assumed we were going inside.

92
00:06:50,167 --> 00:06:53,796
He did the same thing yesterday
when I was walking him.

93
00:06:54,129 --> 00:06:57,121
Any idea why he'd to do that, Mr Crane?

94
00:06:57,424 --> 00:06:59,619
Nope. Dogs are weird.

95
00:07:05,974 --> 00:07:08,408
- That worries me a bit.
- What does?

96
00:07:08,685 --> 00:07:12,803
I think your father's been going there.
I had an uncle who did the same thing.

97
00:07:13,148 --> 00:07:16,504
He had no interest in church,
then he started going every day.

98
00:07:16,818 --> 00:07:21,130
He had some bad news from his doctor.
He didn't even last a year.

99
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:24,562
Well, first of all,
I can see you're upset, so come here.

100
00:07:27,871 --> 00:07:30,863
Thank you, Dr Crane.
You're always so supportive.

101
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:33,157
You're worrying over nothing.

102
00:07:33,418 --> 00:07:37,934
If my father even had a hangnail,
he'd let everyone know about it.

103
00:07:38,298 --> 00:07:41,768
Maybe I've just got myselfworked up
remembering my Uncle John.

104
00:07:42,177 --> 00:07:46,090
Just saying his name gets you upset.
Come here. You need a hug.

105
00:07:52,646 --> 00:07:55,399
Mr Crane, are you all right?

106
00:07:55,732 --> 00:07:57,723
We're fine, Daphne.

107
00:08:00,237 --> 00:08:03,627
See? Nothing to worry about.
Well, I have got to run.

108
00:08:03,949 --> 00:08:07,305
Hold the elevator, Niles.
We'll see you soon, Daphne.

109
00:08:07,619 --> 00:08:10,008
Dad? Don't worry.

110
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:14,949
Niles and I will be there for you.

111
00:08:18,171 --> 00:08:21,243
- What's that about?
- Oh, never mind.

112
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:23,506
I've got to go lie down.

113
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:28,311
Mr Crane, did you call Dr Stewart
for the results ofyour physical?

114
00:08:28,682 --> 00:08:31,401
Yeah, a couple of days ago.

115
00:08:31,685 --> 00:08:33,516
I'm fine.

116
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:35,169
Come on, Eddie.

117
00:08:38,442 --> 00:08:41,718
- Is everything all right?
- Yeah.

118
00:08:42,029 --> 00:08:44,384
It's just all over so fast.

119
00:08:49,828 --> 00:08:52,023
That convinced me I was right.

120
00:08:52,289 --> 00:08:54,484
And the next 24 hours
were a living hell.

121
00:08:55,334 --> 00:08:57,325
The worst came the next day.

122
00:08:57,586 --> 00:09:01,659
I'm terrified about this, Father.
All this came around so sudden.

123
00:09:02,007 --> 00:09:04,362
I'm not prepared.

124
00:09:06,136 --> 00:09:10,049
Tell me again what I'm supposed
to say when I see Jesus the first time.

125
00:09:14,394 --> 00:09:18,307
OK. All right. Well, thank you.
Yeah, I'll see you soon. Bye.

126
00:09:19,941 --> 00:09:20,930
Hi, Daphne.

127
00:09:21,652 --> 00:09:22,880
Hello.

128
00:09:24,571 --> 00:09:27,483
I'm so excited about the gift
I just got for you.

129
00:09:27,783 --> 00:09:31,219
- Great.
- Why don't you open it now?

130
00:09:31,536 --> 00:09:35,654
To tell you the truth, I don't have
much time. I'm kind of on my way out.

131
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:39,787
Wait, OK, all right.
I'll open it now. Sure, sure.

132
00:09:40,128 --> 00:09:44,121
Don't want to get you upset.
You must be really excited about this.

133
00:09:44,466 --> 00:09:48,823
Wow. It's that sweater. The one
I pointed out to you in the window.

134
00:09:49,179 --> 00:09:52,808
It's great.
I can die a happy man now.

135
00:09:54,434 --> 00:09:56,743
What's the matter? Are you all right?

136
00:09:57,562 --> 00:10:01,874
Mr Crane, I know why you've been going
down to that church.

137
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:06,227
You're not supposed to know about that.
But why is it making you so upset?

138
00:10:06,571 --> 00:10:08,562
I care about you.

139
00:10:08,824 --> 00:10:12,100
You were going to let this happen
without telling a soul?

140
00:10:12,411 --> 00:10:15,289
I don't want people staring at me
in that church,

141
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:18,014
stiff as a board,
all that make-up on my face.

142
00:10:22,963 --> 00:10:25,921
So how much time have you got?

143
00:10:27,009 --> 00:10:29,000
About 20 minutes.

144
00:10:30,971 --> 00:10:34,202
- 20 minutes?
- Yeah. Will I be glad when it's over.

145
00:10:34,516 --> 00:10:37,314
This is the last Christmas pageant
I'm signing up for.

146
00:10:37,602 --> 00:10:41,072
- You're in a Christmas pageant?
- Yeah. What'd you think?

147
00:10:41,398 --> 00:10:43,673
- I thought you were dying.
- What?

148
00:10:43,942 --> 00:10:48,015
You just got your test results back,
you're at the church all the time.

149
00:10:48,363 --> 00:10:50,558
- Why are you laughing?
- That's funny.

150
00:10:51,033 --> 00:10:53,911
- I don't think it's so bloody funny.
- Are you kidding?

151
00:10:54,202 --> 00:10:56,238
- I'm dying.
- You will be.

152
00:10:56,496 --> 00:11:00,409
- Daphne, don't do that.
- Don't you tell me what to do.

153
00:11:00,751 --> 00:11:04,187
What kind of house were you
brought up in anyway for God's sake?

154
00:11:11,595 --> 00:11:13,711
You can talk about it ifyou like.

155
00:11:14,598 --> 00:11:16,987
I'm not ready just yet.

156
00:11:23,815 --> 00:11:27,125
I can't tell you how good that feels.

157
00:11:27,444 --> 00:11:30,402
I don't think I've ever
had a massage like this before.

158
00:11:30,697 --> 00:11:34,007
Well, I'm glad.
As long as you're so relaxed,

159
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:37,557
maybe I should give you
your Christmas present right now.

160
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,949
Ow!

161
00:11:45,337 --> 00:11:46,850
You woke me up.

162
00:11:47,089 --> 00:11:49,319
Sorry.
I guess this ankle's a bit tender.

163
00:11:51,009 --> 00:11:54,604
Yours would be, too,
ifyou'd had the day I had.

164
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:59,128
I'd gone out to do some shopping.
Then I arrived at Frasier's building.

165
00:11:59,476 --> 00:12:02,070
I'm sorry, I don't mean to crowd you.

166
00:12:02,354 --> 00:12:05,232
This is a brand-new,
hand-tailored ltalian suit.

167
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:07,879
It's difficult to get sap out of silk.

168
00:12:08,151 --> 00:12:10,426
Another reason we didn't need this tree.

169
00:12:11,947 --> 00:12:13,938
This thing's a fire hazard.

170
00:12:14,574 --> 00:12:17,884
They make a chemical now
that you can use to fireproof a tree.

171
00:12:18,328 --> 00:12:20,603
It causes cancer.

172
00:12:20,872 --> 00:12:23,386
Happy holidays, then.

173
00:12:24,543 --> 00:12:28,058
- What just happened?
- I think the elevator stopped.

174
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,496
I'm sure we'll get it going in a moment.

175
00:12:30,757 --> 00:12:34,193
We've probably got about 20 minutes
of oxygen.

176
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:38,417
- Sir, you're going to alarm everyone.
- I work in an ER.

177
00:12:38,724 --> 00:12:42,000
Perhaps you can instruct us
on how to stay cool in a crisis.

178
00:12:42,311 --> 00:12:46,145
I was on duty when the elevator cable
snapped at the Bing building.

179
00:12:46,481 --> 00:12:49,553
They brought those people in
on cookie sheets.

180
00:12:52,321 --> 00:12:54,312
Hello? Is anyone there?

181
00:12:54,573 --> 00:12:55,847
Yeah, who is it?

182
00:12:56,074 --> 00:12:58,190
We're stuck in one ofyour elevators.

183
00:12:58,452 --> 00:13:01,762
The doors won't open and we're stuck.

184
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:05,231
- Where are you calling from, sir?
- Elliott Bay Towers.

185
00:13:05,542 --> 00:13:09,330
It could be an hour and a half
before anybody gets there.

186
00:13:09,671 --> 00:13:12,822
My children are alone
upstairs in the apartment.

187
00:13:13,133 --> 00:13:16,170
Haven't got a gas oven up there,
have you?

188
00:13:17,638 --> 00:13:21,153
If somebody climbed through
the trap door on top ofyour car,

189
00:13:21,475 --> 00:13:25,593
there's a manual release switch
up there that would open up your doors.

190
00:13:25,937 --> 00:13:31,648
- Somebody's got to go up there.
- That's a pretty small opening.

191
00:13:32,069 --> 00:13:36,506
I have more confidence in your wife
than you do. I'll give you a leg up.

192
00:13:36,865 --> 00:13:39,299
It has to be you.

193
00:13:41,203 --> 00:13:43,717
- How do I get up there?
- Climb up the tree.

194
00:13:43,997 --> 00:13:45,032
Oh, come on.

195
00:13:45,248 --> 00:13:47,808
Surely you climbed trees
when you were a boy.

196
00:13:48,085 --> 00:13:50,076
That's Dr Crane's brother.

197
00:13:55,217 --> 00:13:56,206
Fine.

198
00:13:57,552 --> 00:14:00,703
I suppose in times of crisis,
someone must be a hero.

199
00:14:01,014 --> 00:14:06,930
Today that man is Niles Crane. Tomorrow,
it will be my dry-cleaner, Mr Li.

200
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:14,778
Grab his feet
and we'll push him through.

201
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:17,061
Not so fast.

202
00:14:18,031 --> 00:14:21,148
Not to worry. I have landed
in a nice soft puddle of grease.

203
00:14:23,078 --> 00:14:25,911
I just have to find the release switch.
Bear with me.

204
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:30,760
- Quick.
- Did that do anything?

205
00:14:32,629 --> 00:14:33,618
People?

206
00:14:35,048 --> 00:14:37,039
Lady with my coat?

207
00:14:39,886 --> 00:14:41,285
Where did you all go?

208
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:48,183
Oh, my God.
We're going up! Someone stop this thing!

209
00:15:00,324 --> 00:15:03,361
- Why is that man crawling?
- That's Dr Crane's brother.

210
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:07,361
I was shaken by what I had done.

211
00:15:07,622 --> 00:15:11,137
But I had composed myself
as I arrived at Frasier's.

212
00:15:12,085 --> 00:15:15,600
It was some time later before
I was able to say what had happened.

213
00:15:15,922 --> 00:15:19,471
I have no idea what you use
to get elevator grease out of silk.

214
00:15:19,801 --> 00:15:22,679
Brown suede
seems to be leeching it out nicely.

215
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:29,042
Anyway, no Christmas is complete
without a bit of tumult.

216
00:15:29,353 --> 00:15:33,028
But now we can all relax and enjoy
a lovely holiday evening together.

217
00:15:33,357 --> 00:15:34,870
Merry Christmas!

218
00:15:39,446 --> 00:15:42,244
- You sure you want to hear about this?
- Why not?

219
00:15:42,532 --> 00:15:45,126
OK. I've been feeling depressed

220
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:48,720
because I'm putting on
all this weight. I'm pregnant.

221
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:51,075
- Hey, guys.
- Hi, Roz.

222
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:54,086
- That's a nice suit.
- Thank you. It's brand-new.

223
00:15:54,378 --> 00:15:56,573
And since you'll be ordering food,

224
00:15:56,838 --> 00:16:00,717
I will go
rather than risk getting it stained.

225
00:16:01,051 --> 00:16:04,202
Is that some kind of crack
about how much I eat?

226
00:16:04,513 --> 00:16:07,550
Absolutely not. It's a crack
about your table manners.

227
00:16:08,684 --> 00:16:11,756
I should go. I've got a couple
of hours before the pageant.

228
00:16:12,062 --> 00:16:16,180
- And I need the time to rehearse.
- Come tomorrow, it'll all be a memory.

229
00:16:16,525 --> 00:16:21,360
But even after it's over, I still have
to make peace with the man upstairs.

230
00:16:22,864 --> 00:16:27,142
Are you sure we have
to do this charity thing this afternoon?

231
00:16:27,494 --> 00:16:30,452
Come on, Roz, it's just an hour
out of your life.

232
00:16:30,747 --> 00:16:33,022
You'll make an adorable Mrs Claus.

233
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:36,328
Why? Because now I've gotten so fat?

234
00:16:41,008 --> 00:16:44,398
Hello. Why, yes, Mrs Doyle, yes, she is.

235
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,518
Just a moment.
They forwarded her from the office.

236
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:51,162
Hello, Mom? Yes, I got your message.

237
00:16:52,269 --> 00:16:55,341
Yep, I'm picking you up
at the airport, 10am.

238
00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:57,638
Looking forward to seeing you, too.

239
00:16:57,899 --> 00:17:00,333
- Let me say Merry Christmas.
- Hang on, Mom.

240
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:02,885
Mrs Doyle.
Hi, happy holidays.

241
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:05,544
Just a word to the wise.

242
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:08,384
Roz has put on quite a few
pregnancy pounds of late

243
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,810
and she's really sensitive about it.

244
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:13,912
I would be careful
what you say to her, all right?

245
00:17:14,207 --> 00:17:16,641
Bye-bye. We'll see you soon. Bye.

246
00:17:18,211 --> 00:17:20,964
I'll meet you over there.
I still have gifts to get.

247
00:17:21,256 --> 00:17:24,726
I still have all of mine to get.
No matter how hard I try,

248
00:17:25,052 --> 00:17:28,442
I can't seem find anything
that seems right this year.

249
00:17:28,764 --> 00:17:32,757
It's really sweet how you're trying
so hard to make all your gifts special.

250
00:17:33,101 --> 00:17:37,060
I'm sorry I've been so cranky.
I'm just nervous about my mom coming.

251
00:17:37,397 --> 00:17:41,436
I'm dreading the big conversation
where I finally tell her I'm pregnant.

252
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:52,549
- You haven't told her yet?
- No.

253
00:17:52,829 --> 00:17:56,378
It's just not the type ofthing
you blurt out over the phone.

254
00:17:58,669 --> 00:18:01,183
I'll let you get that.
I'll see you over there.

255
00:18:03,131 --> 00:18:06,680
Hello? Yes, I had a feeling
you might call back.

256
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,711
I was beginning to worry about you.

257
00:18:10,973 --> 00:18:15,808
I'm on the verge of a complete
breakdown. Shopping was a disaster.

258
00:18:16,186 --> 00:18:19,622
When I went to slip into this darling
costume, my pants split.

259
00:18:20,649 --> 00:18:24,358
And I can't stop thinking about my mom.
How am I going to tell her?

260
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:29,533
- lfyou'd like, I can tell her for you.
- She'll be mad I waited three months.

261
00:18:29,908 --> 00:18:32,820
It'd be worse
hearing it from someone else.

262
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,509
- It's possible she already knows.
- No way.

263
00:18:35,789 --> 00:18:40,419
The only person who knows she's spoken
to is you. Oh, my God. Frasier.

264
00:18:40,794 --> 00:18:42,864
OK. Who's first?

265
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,950
I'm going to kill you.

266
00:18:46,216 --> 00:18:50,448
- You're going to kill Santa?
- No, Mrs Claus just wants to kiss me.

267
00:18:50,804 --> 00:18:54,114
Yeah, I'll kiss you. Come here.
I'll kiss you good.

268
00:18:56,184 --> 00:18:58,823
Here, run along. Are you insane?

269
00:18:59,104 --> 00:19:02,733
Roz, you tell your mother everything.
How was I supposed to know?

270
00:19:03,066 --> 00:19:05,580
Hi, Santa. I want a pony for Christmas.

271
00:19:05,861 --> 00:19:08,216
You got it. Now beat it.

272
00:19:08,488 --> 00:19:10,365
- Can't we talk about this later?
- No.

273
00:19:10,615 --> 00:19:11,604
Hi, Santa.

274
00:19:11,825 --> 00:19:15,056
Oh, my God, what are you, 20?
Get out of here.

275
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:17,361
Try to stay calm.

276
00:19:17,622 --> 00:19:21,934
No, I will not stay calm, because
I am not calm. I am completely freaked.

277
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:24,603
I am pregnant, and you
told my crazy mother,

278
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:30,398
and I'm too fat to even be Mrs Santa.
And I hate this holiday.

279
00:19:34,514 --> 00:19:37,233
Mrs Claus was up very late last night.

280
00:19:38,727 --> 00:19:43,039
I still had to stop by Frasier's.
I had to give him his champagne glasses.

281
00:19:43,565 --> 00:19:45,044
Merry Christmas!

282
00:19:46,443 --> 00:19:50,231
Roz, don't go. I'm sorry about
what happened, but it was a mistake.

283
00:19:50,572 --> 00:19:54,087
- You can't stay mad at me.
- I have to face my mother tomorrow.

284
00:19:54,409 --> 00:19:58,197
We can talk about that.
Come on in. Please, come in.

285
00:19:58,538 --> 00:20:01,848
How would it look if I turned
a pregnant lady out on Christmas Eve

286
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:04,317
when there's so much room
here at the inn?

287
00:20:05,462 --> 00:20:08,022
Niles, Daphne, Roz is here.

288
00:20:08,298 --> 00:20:10,129
- Hi.
- Hello.

289
00:20:10,384 --> 00:20:14,980
Come on, people. Let's liven things up
a little. It's Christmas Eve.

290
00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:19,022
What are the Cranes known for
if not their legendary holiday spirit?

291
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:22,741
I hate singing, and I hate Christmas,
and I'm going to bed.

292
00:20:24,398 --> 00:20:25,547
Dad, what happened?

293
00:20:25,774 --> 00:20:29,210
I went into my song
and we come up to the high note

294
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:31,678
and I think
I'm going to hit it for once.

295
00:20:31,947 --> 00:20:37,180
Then I see Eddie with his head
buried in the Christ child's cradle.

296
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:40,930
He mistook the Christ child
for a chewtoy

297
00:20:41,206 --> 00:20:43,640
and grabs hold of it
and starts shaking it.

298
00:20:43,917 --> 00:20:46,636
So, the Virgin Mary
grabs hold of one of his legs.

299
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,798
Eddie loves a good tug ofwar,
so they're going at it.

300
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:55,483
Then Eddie goes running outwith
half of Bethlehem chasing after him.

301
00:20:55,887 --> 00:20:57,878
I never should have agreed to do it.

302
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:01,098
- You'd have saved me grief.
- Don't start this again.

303
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:05,068
- Don't you talk to her like that.
- Let's not say something we'll regret.

304
00:21:05,397 --> 00:21:09,276
- You're one to talk.
- Roz, I know it's hard to forget...

305
00:21:11,903 --> 00:21:13,894
All right! That is enough!

306
00:21:15,032 --> 00:21:18,069
This is the night we celebrate peace
and togetherness!

307
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:20,640
I will not have that ruined!

308
00:21:27,461 --> 00:21:30,498
I intend to put us all
in the right frame of mind

309
00:21:31,798 --> 00:21:34,358
by giving you all my gift.

310
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:38,923
I was determined to make my gift
this year a little more meaningful,

311
00:21:39,264 --> 00:21:42,620
and after a great deal of effort,
I believe I have.

312
00:21:42,934 --> 00:21:47,485
My gift does not come from some fancy
store, all wrapped in glittery paper.

313
00:21:48,982 --> 00:21:51,576
My gift comes from my heart.

314
00:21:52,903 --> 00:21:56,782
Tonight I intend to sit each one ofyou
down and tell you in my own words

315
00:21:57,741 --> 00:22:00,335
exactly how much you mean to me.

316
00:22:02,162 --> 00:22:06,314
That's it? Are you out ofyour mind?

317
00:22:06,667 --> 00:22:09,420
Or I could get someone over
to give us all massages.

318
00:22:09,711 --> 00:22:11,064
Great!

319
00:22:12,589 --> 00:22:13,942
I'm so tense!
