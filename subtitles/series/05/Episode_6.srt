1
00:00:09,933 --> 00:00:12,401
Good show today, Roz.
I thought that...

2
00:00:12,686 --> 00:00:15,325
Oh, my God,
there's Connie from Promotions.

3
00:00:15,605 --> 00:00:19,200
Every time she sees me,
she hits me up for another charity.

4
00:00:19,526 --> 00:00:23,314
Maybe it's time to set some limits.
How hard can it be to say no just once?

5
00:00:23,655 --> 00:00:25,646
Look who I'm talking to.

6
00:00:26,408 --> 00:00:28,399
Hi. Roz, I was looking for you.

7
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:31,777
Before you say anything,
there's something I need to say.

8
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:36,073
I have bought Girl Scout cookies,
paid for your kids' band uniforms,

9
00:00:36,418 --> 00:00:40,127
I bought tickets
to every raffle your church ever had.

10
00:00:40,464 --> 00:00:43,137
So whatever you came to say,
I'm not interested.

11
00:00:43,425 --> 00:00:48,783
I'll just go then. By the way, my
church had its raffle drawing yesterday.

12
00:00:49,181 --> 00:00:52,378
You won the grand prize.
Sorry to bother you.

13
00:00:52,684 --> 00:00:55,994
Connie. I'm sorry. Connie, don't.
Who cares? What did I win?

14
00:00:59,066 --> 00:01:03,105
Oh, my God.
It's that free ski weekend.

15
00:01:03,445 --> 00:01:05,595
Listen to this/ "Dear Winner."

16
00:01:05,864 --> 00:01:09,618
"You'll enjoy a one weekend rental
of a private ski lodge on Mount Baker

17
00:01:09,951 --> 00:01:12,784
complete with lessons
from a former Olympic champ."

18
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,390
That is a grand prize, indeed.
I'm just a bit envious.

19
00:01:16,708 --> 00:01:18,699
I hope you have a wonderful weekend.

20
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,636
It seems a pity you won't be able
to take advantage ofthose ski lessons.

21
00:01:24,007 --> 00:01:25,998
There'll be other stuffto do.

22
00:01:26,259 --> 00:01:30,571
Tons. Just because you can't ski, or for
that matter, hike, sled or snowboard,

23
00:01:30,931 --> 00:01:35,959
it doesn't mean you can't curl up by
a roaring fire with a warm snifter of...

24
00:01:36,353 --> 00:01:37,866
Sorry.

25
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:42,613
- Well, the scenery will be nice.
- Breathtaking.

26
00:01:42,901 --> 00:01:45,734
I just hope you can
endure the four-hour drive up there,

27
00:01:46,029 --> 00:01:48,020
and you so carsick these days.

28
00:01:48,281 --> 00:01:51,990
I know what you're hinting at. This
is the first thing I've won in my life,

29
00:01:52,327 --> 00:01:56,639
and it means something to me.
So I won't sell it or trade it for a...

30
00:01:56,999 --> 00:01:59,877
- Big-screen TV?
- Key's in the envelope.

31
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:09,986
Why do you need that so loud?
You've gone deaf as a post.

32
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:13,182
It's just a cold stopping up my ears.
I'll be fine.

33
00:02:13,473 --> 00:02:16,545
Whose lawyer are you, anyway?
No, I will not calm down.

34
00:02:16,852 --> 00:02:21,164
They call that a settlement?
You call them and turn it down.

35
00:02:21,523 --> 00:02:25,880
- I said turn it down, you ninny.
- You could at least ask nicely.

36
00:02:29,114 --> 00:02:33,346
I've got to get a new divorce lawyer.
Claude is no match for Maris' team.

37
00:02:33,702 --> 00:02:35,454
Real sharks, are they?

38
00:02:35,704 --> 00:02:37,740
I once sent Maris a Valentine that said,

39
00:02:37,998 --> 00:02:41,229
"You're the girl my heart adores.
Everything I have is yours."

40
00:02:41,543 --> 00:02:43,613
Now they're calling it a pre-nup.

41
00:02:45,589 --> 00:02:48,706
That's terrible. Can you imagine
using that as a weapon?

42
00:02:49,009 --> 00:02:53,082
- An old Valentine.
- I'd love a cold Ballantine.

43
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,705
You're getting a hearing aid.

44
00:02:55,974 --> 00:02:59,967
I don't need a hearing aid. My hearing
will be back to normal in no time.

45
00:03:00,312 --> 00:03:03,543
Soon you won't be able
to hear a word I say.

46
00:03:03,857 --> 00:03:06,576
Wouldn't that be a tragedy?

47
00:03:07,486 --> 00:03:10,842
Why are you all loitering around
when you should be packing?

48
00:03:11,156 --> 00:03:14,387
- Packing for what?
- The ski weekend I'm taking us on.

49
00:03:14,701 --> 00:03:16,339
You're kidding.

50
00:03:16,578 --> 00:03:20,173
With an Olympic champion in residence
to give us lessons.

51
00:03:20,499 --> 00:03:25,289
It sounds like heaven. Skiing,
then warming up with a hot rum drink,

52
00:03:25,671 --> 00:03:29,061
curled up under a blanket
in front of a roaring fire.

53
00:03:29,383 --> 00:03:32,102
I can feel the steam
rising off my toddy already.

54
00:03:36,556 --> 00:03:38,990
- I can't go.
- Why not?

55
00:03:39,267 --> 00:03:42,896
It's Annie's birthday
and I promised I'd spend it with her.

56
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:46,984
- Bring her along.
- She's gung-ho for sports.

57
00:03:47,317 --> 00:03:49,990
She was captain
of the girls' rugby team at school.

58
00:03:50,278 --> 00:03:52,348
I'm not sure
how many bedrooms there are.

59
00:03:52,614 --> 00:03:53,842
She can have mine.

60
00:03:54,074 --> 00:03:56,793
- Where will you sleep?
- I'll think of something.

61
00:03:59,579 --> 00:04:02,457
- Are you sure you wouldn't mind?
- Why not?

62
00:04:02,749 --> 00:04:06,583
What could be more fun
than a gung-ho girls' rugby captain?

63
00:04:07,754 --> 00:04:10,507
I will kill you forthis.

64
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,108
Itwas the onlyway
Daphne was going to come

65
00:04:13,385 --> 00:04:16,297
and I wasn't going to let
a moonlit ski lodge go to waste.

66
00:04:16,596 --> 00:04:19,235
You filed for divorce a week ago.
Can't you wait?

67
00:04:19,516 --> 00:04:21,871
Wait? I have waited
five long years for this.

68
00:04:22,144 --> 00:04:25,898
- Dad, don't you think it's about time?
- I got ten after five.

69
00:04:26,231 --> 00:04:29,667
If you want to make a fool out
of yourself with Daphne, go ahead.

70
00:04:29,985 --> 00:04:33,421
But I will not have you ruin
my ski weekend by inviting this girl

71
00:04:33,739 --> 00:04:37,937
who sounds like an avalanche risk.
I'm going to tell Daphne no guests.

72
00:04:38,285 --> 00:04:41,755
I called Annie. She's all excited.
She just bought new skis

73
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,072
with the money she made
off her new swimsuit calendar.

74
00:04:51,882 --> 00:04:54,715
I hope you're happy.
We're stuck with her now.

75
00:04:59,264 --> 00:05:01,095
Look at this place.

76
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:03,341
Look at this place.

77
00:05:05,437 --> 00:05:07,632
Nothing like a change of scenery, huh?

78
00:05:08,857 --> 00:05:11,690
Where do you suppose the TV is?

79
00:05:14,571 --> 00:05:16,562
This place is terrific.

80
00:05:16,823 --> 00:05:20,657
I'm just glad we got here alive,
the way you were taking those curves.

81
00:05:20,994 --> 00:05:23,713
Poor Annie
kept getting thrown up against you.

82
00:05:23,997 --> 00:05:27,194
What can I say? I'm a bad driver.

83
00:05:27,501 --> 00:05:30,618
I grant you she's cuddly,
but don't you find her a tad,

84
00:05:30,921 --> 00:05:33,913
what would the polite
euphemism be, stupid?

85
00:05:34,216 --> 00:05:37,413
Niles, she is just unschooled,
like Eliza Doolittle.

86
00:05:37,719 --> 00:05:41,712
You find herthe right Henry Higgins,
she'll be readyfor a ball in no time.

87
00:05:42,057 --> 00:05:45,254
Leave it to you to put the "pig"
back in Pygmalion.

88
00:05:47,312 --> 00:05:49,780
This place is just lovely.

89
00:05:50,065 --> 00:05:54,297
Yes, isn't it? Look at that vista.
It's stunning.

90
00:05:54,653 --> 00:05:57,042
Puts one in mind of the Matterhorn.

91
00:05:57,322 --> 00:06:00,041
I wouldn't know.
I'm not very musical.

92
00:06:02,411 --> 00:06:05,608
That's a relief. The way you
were swerving on the ride up here,

93
00:06:05,914 --> 00:06:10,704
I was afraid these would get broken.
I'm going to make some hot buttered rum.

94
00:06:11,086 --> 00:06:14,795
It's cold in the mountains.
You need a little fat in your booze.

95
00:06:15,132 --> 00:06:19,284
Good thinking, Dad. And I'll whip
us up a nice batch of pork nog.

96
00:06:21,388 --> 00:06:26,257
Daphne, let me help you with your
luggage. What room did you want?

97
00:06:26,643 --> 00:06:28,918
That one on the left
should have a nice view.

98
00:06:29,187 --> 00:06:30,859
Right next to my room.

99
00:06:31,106 --> 00:06:35,896
- I'll take the one next to that.
- Right. Let me take that for you.

100
00:06:36,278 --> 00:06:38,269
That Niles is quite a cutie.

101
00:06:40,157 --> 00:06:43,672
- He's the one getting divorced?
- Yeah. He's been just miserable.

102
00:06:43,994 --> 00:06:47,873
- I may just have to cheer him up.
- You just leave Dr Crane alone.

103
00:06:48,206 --> 00:06:51,960
I've seen the way you go through men.
The last thing he needs

104
00:06:52,294 --> 00:06:55,650
- is someone else to break his heart.
- But it's my birthday.

105
00:06:55,964 --> 00:07:00,003
- Besides, you're not his nanny.
- Let's just have a relaxing ski trip.

106
00:07:00,344 --> 00:07:03,256
Does this weekend have to be about sex?

107
00:07:05,223 --> 00:07:06,372
Hello.

108
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,318
- I am Guy.
- Daphne.

109
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,754
Annie.

110
00:07:09,978 --> 00:07:14,733
I hope you are ready to ski tomorrow.
I am going to work you very hard.

111
00:07:15,108 --> 00:07:18,817
- Dibs on the Frenchman.
- You can have him.

112
00:07:19,154 --> 00:07:24,387
- He's not half as cute as Dr Crane.
- Enough. My ears are burning.

113
00:07:24,785 --> 00:07:28,095
Everyone, did you meet Guy,
our ski instructor?

114
00:07:28,413 --> 00:07:31,052
I will also be your chef.
Tonight, entrecôte à la Guy.

115
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:33,884
A ski champion and gourmet.
Vous êtes formidable.

116
00:07:34,628 --> 00:07:35,504
- Vous êtes formidable.
- Parlez français?

117
00:07:35,629 --> 00:07:38,018
J'ai habité à Paris
quandj'étais un étudiant.

118
00:07:38,256 --> 00:07:39,928
- You speak very well.
- Oui.

119
00:07:40,175 --> 00:07:42,564
You speak French as well?

120
00:07:42,844 --> 00:07:46,632
No, all I know how to say is oui.

121
00:07:46,974 --> 00:07:50,011
That should be enough
to get you through the weekend.

122
00:07:52,729 --> 00:07:57,439
Look at that, two deer in the snow,
just kind of nuzzling each other.

123
00:07:57,818 --> 00:07:59,490
How romantic.

124
00:07:59,736 --> 00:08:02,933
Yes, it's enough to put ideas
in one's head.

125
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,231
Isn't it?

126
00:08:06,827 --> 00:08:07,816
Yes.

127
00:08:09,538 --> 00:08:11,529
I should say so.

128
00:08:12,165 --> 00:08:13,837
Absolument.

129
00:08:29,224 --> 00:08:33,456
Look at you. You're handy,
you're a chef, a ski champ.

130
00:08:33,812 --> 00:08:37,248
- Is there anything you don't do?
- There are a few things.

131
00:08:40,694 --> 00:08:42,969
Niles, you look très élégant.

132
00:08:43,238 --> 00:08:47,117
Well, I simply had to change.
After all that rum and good food,

133
00:08:47,451 --> 00:08:51,569
I thought I was going
to burst out of my trousers.

134
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:57,256
- Dr Crane, what a smashing robe.
- Well, thank you.

135
00:08:57,544 --> 00:09:00,342
- Doesn't he look handsome?
- Yes, quite.

136
00:09:00,631 --> 00:09:04,306
Look at this.
I've finished my buttered rum.

137
00:09:04,635 --> 00:09:07,866
Frasier Crane would never allow
a woman to go thirsty.

138
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:11,650
Daphne, see if Dad's finished
with that second batch.

139
00:09:14,478 --> 00:09:17,117
- Two more.
- All right, almost there.

140
00:09:17,397 --> 00:09:19,752
I just have to replace some of this rum.

141
00:09:20,025 --> 00:09:23,574
Just what Annie needs.
She's all over Dr Crane as it is.

142
00:09:23,904 --> 00:09:27,055
Why couldn't Annie be hot for Frasier?

143
00:09:27,366 --> 00:09:29,926
- What?
- Annie. Hot for Frasier.

144
00:09:33,205 --> 00:09:36,675
I should just forget about those two
and concentrate on Guy.

145
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,310
Now he's the sort oftall drink ofwater
I could really go for.

146
00:09:44,174 --> 00:09:45,607
There you go.

147
00:09:45,842 --> 00:09:50,154
It's the rum I'm after. It'll be just
the thing to clinch things with Annie.

148
00:09:50,514 --> 00:09:53,870
Annie? I know something about that.
She's hot for you.

149
00:09:54,184 --> 00:09:56,334
- Says who?
- Daphne.

150
00:09:56,603 --> 00:09:59,163
She said, "Annie's hot for Frasier".

151
00:09:59,439 --> 00:10:02,112
I knew my charms would work.

152
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:07,236
I should register this dressing gown
with the love police.

153
00:10:07,614 --> 00:10:09,730
I know the pain you're going through.

154
00:10:09,992 --> 00:10:13,541
I've never been divorced myself,
but my last boyfriend was...

155
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:15,269
eventually.

156
00:10:17,207 --> 00:10:21,439
What you need is something to take your
mind off it. What always works for me...

157
00:10:21,795 --> 00:10:23,865
- Time to go upstairs.
- What for?

158
00:10:24,131 --> 00:10:27,567
I need to give you
your birthday present. It's in me room.

159
00:10:27,884 --> 00:10:29,875
I'll see you in a bit.

160
00:10:35,851 --> 00:10:37,682
- Hello.
- Hi.

161
00:10:37,936 --> 00:10:41,133
Daphne did not like
the way Annie was flirting with you.

162
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,318
- No, she didn't, did she?
- No.

163
00:10:44,609 --> 00:10:47,601
In fact, she dragged her
right offto her bedroom.

164
00:10:50,657 --> 00:10:53,217
I think I know what that means.

165
00:10:53,493 --> 00:10:55,484
You like it?

166
00:10:57,414 --> 00:10:59,405
I thinkwe both know.

167
00:11:02,753 --> 00:11:04,744
Daphne was jealous.

168
00:11:05,005 --> 00:11:08,554
She was jealous, wasn't she?
I don't believe it.

169
00:11:08,884 --> 00:11:11,478
I am surprised by nothing.

170
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:17,320
I think you did not
like Annie's flirting either.

171
00:11:17,643 --> 00:11:21,033
- ltwas that obvious?
- Annie's not your...

172
00:11:22,147 --> 00:11:23,705
...cup of tea?

173
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:28,809
Just between us,
my interests lie elsewhere this weekend.

174
00:11:33,909 --> 00:11:34,898
Really?

175
00:11:38,955 --> 00:11:40,229
Rum's ready.

176
00:11:40,457 --> 00:11:43,369
Guy, perhaps you could
help my dad with the drinks.

177
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:45,705
- At your service.
- Thank you, Guy.

178
00:11:49,383 --> 00:11:51,499
- Daphne wants me.
- She told you that?

179
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,751
No, but Annie was flirting with me,

180
00:11:54,012 --> 00:11:56,572
and Daphne dragged her off
in a jealous rage.

181
00:11:56,848 --> 00:12:00,045
- No, Annie's hot for me.
- I know when I'm being flirted with.

182
00:12:00,352 --> 00:12:03,788
Niles, you really are the limit
sometimes. You're delusional.

183
00:12:04,106 --> 00:12:08,418
Next thing you know, you'll be telling
me that Guy's after you.

184
00:12:08,777 --> 00:12:10,733
How do you like your rum?

185
00:12:10,988 --> 00:12:13,343
It's kind of small,
but it has a nice view.

186
00:12:14,992 --> 00:12:18,462
- No, your rum.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

187
00:12:18,787 --> 00:12:22,780
I wonder if it's clouded my judgement
about something.

188
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:25,355
Your son, Niles...

189
00:12:25,627 --> 00:12:29,984
is it my imagination,
or is he attracted to...?

190
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:33,855
Hold it right there. It's not your
imagination. He's got it bad.

191
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:39,054
Really?
This is not a delicate subject for you?

192
00:12:39,391 --> 00:12:42,110
No. Niles has had those feelings
foryears.

193
00:12:42,394 --> 00:12:45,431
I didn't encourage it
during his so-called marriage,

194
00:12:45,731 --> 00:12:49,724
but now that he's free, whatever
makes him happy. I say go for it.

195
00:12:51,486 --> 00:12:53,477
You are a wonderful father.

196
00:12:54,156 --> 00:12:56,147
OK, everybody, come and get it.

197
00:12:57,117 --> 00:12:59,677
Daphne, just in time.

198
00:12:59,953 --> 00:13:02,069
Well, Annie, that's a lovely gown.

199
00:13:02,331 --> 00:13:04,322
Daphne just gave it to me.

200
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,574
- Really?
- I bet she did.

201
00:13:12,049 --> 00:13:15,280
Dad, this is even stronger
than the last batch.

202
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:17,949
The first time I made it
was for your mother.

203
00:13:18,221 --> 00:13:21,816
I wanted to pop the question
but I was afraid she'd say no.

204
00:13:22,142 --> 00:13:25,737
This gave me the nerve to ask her
and I got myself a great big "yes".

205
00:13:26,063 --> 00:13:30,181
And that wasn't the only yes I got
from her that night either.

206
00:13:30,525 --> 00:13:33,358
Still scares me how close I came
to chickening out.

207
00:13:33,654 --> 00:13:37,567
You know, as you get older,
it's not the failures that you regret

208
00:13:37,908 --> 00:13:40,342
or the times
you made an ass ofyourself.

209
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:46,296
It's the times you never even tried,
when you just lost your nerve.

210
00:13:48,251 --> 00:13:50,242
- Wise words.
- Hear, hear.

211
00:13:50,504 --> 00:13:54,417
Faint heart never won fair lady.

212
00:13:54,758 --> 00:13:56,749
I'd hope that if a man fancied me,

213
00:13:57,010 --> 00:14:01,845
he wouldn't be afraid to take a chance,
go for a bold gesture.

214
00:14:05,394 --> 00:14:09,910
Yes, we must never be too timid
to pursue our heart's desire.

215
00:14:10,273 --> 00:14:14,789
And not give a damn what the world
thinks. Right, Miss Moon?

216
00:14:16,613 --> 00:14:18,126
Indeed.

217
00:14:19,908 --> 00:14:22,263
It takes an hour to make one ofthese

218
00:14:22,536 --> 00:14:25,846
but it's worth it just to sit here
and savour every sip.

219
00:14:26,164 --> 00:14:28,883
- I'm done.
- Time for bed.

220
00:14:29,167 --> 00:14:33,001
Wait, you're not going already,
are you? Oh, all right. Good night.

221
00:14:33,338 --> 00:14:35,374
- Good night.
- Enjoy your rum.

222
00:14:35,632 --> 00:14:37,862
I'd enjoy it more if it had a TV in it.

223
00:14:44,349 --> 00:14:47,466
- I thought Daphne's room was...
- They must have switched.

224
00:14:53,108 --> 00:14:56,578
- Sorry, I took the wrong room.
- I thought we got that backwards.

225
00:14:56,903 --> 00:14:58,541
No harm done.

226
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:04,286
- Annie?
- Daphne?

227
00:15:05,996 --> 00:15:07,827
- Good night, Niles.
- Good night.

228
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:10,989
Hello?

229
00:15:13,128 --> 00:15:14,117
Hello.

230
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:18,467
I know what you want.
Don't be timid. Go for it.

231
00:15:27,017 --> 00:15:28,006
Daphne?

232
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:37,683
- Hello, it's Niles.
- Just a moment.

233
00:15:37,986 --> 00:15:41,501
I can't wait. If I don't say this now,
I may lose my nerve. I need you.

234
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:44,621
I've wanted you
since the moment I laid eyes on you.

235
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:48,061
- I feel the exact same way.
- Annie!

236
00:15:49,289 --> 00:15:52,326
I see you're surprised.
I've tried to send you signals,

237
00:15:52,626 --> 00:15:55,299
but as usual I was too damned subtle.

238
00:15:55,879 --> 00:15:58,109
Promise you won't mention
this to Daphne.

239
00:15:58,382 --> 00:16:00,737
- My lips are sealed.
- Not for long, I hope.

240
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:03,804
Come in.

241
00:16:04,054 --> 00:16:05,043
Guy!

242
00:16:07,683 --> 00:16:11,198
- Niles, I thought I heard you in here.
- What do you want?

243
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:15,513
Niles, you told me
you wanted to see that thing.

244
00:16:15,857 --> 00:16:17,848
You know, in my room.

245
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:20,465
Yes, thank you for reminding me.

246
00:16:21,321 --> 00:16:24,119
- What thing?
- It won't take long. Catch you later.

247
00:16:25,993 --> 00:16:28,143
Boy, that was close.
I owe you a big one.

248
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:32,556
Your room?

249
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:35,988
Good point. She's next door.
She's bound to hear me in there.

250
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:38,855
We can go in my room.

251
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:42,248
Much safer. No matter how hard I try,
I'm bound to make noise.

252
00:16:42,551 --> 00:16:43,586
Me. too.

253
00:16:45,178 --> 00:16:47,214
- Daphne.
- Dr Crane.

254
00:16:47,472 --> 00:16:49,986
Miss Moon.
Is your room not satisfactory?

255
00:16:50,267 --> 00:16:53,065
I seem to have made a dreadful mistake.

256
00:16:53,353 --> 00:16:56,868
- What are you doing in Guy's room?
- Is this Guy's room then?

257
00:16:57,190 --> 00:17:00,626
- I was looking for Annie's room.
- Now it makes sense.

258
00:17:02,112 --> 00:17:04,831
- I'll just go.
- Wait for me. The hall is very dark.

259
00:17:05,115 --> 00:17:07,185
I'll show you the way.

260
00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:10,856
- My room should be safe now.
- Very well. I'll see you later.

261
00:17:11,163 --> 00:17:12,391
Excellent, yes.

262
00:17:16,001 --> 00:17:18,469
- Dr Crane?
- Hello.

263
00:17:18,754 --> 00:17:20,028
Frasier.

264
00:17:20,255 --> 00:17:23,486
- What were you doing in Guy's room?
- Just saying good night.

265
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:27,839
- We're off to say good night to Annie.
- Good night to you, Dr Crane.

266
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:30,330
Yes, thank you. So, Annie...

267
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:34,308
- How long will you be?
- Just a minute or two.

268
00:17:34,645 --> 00:17:36,761
- Right.
- Is that champagne?

269
00:17:37,022 --> 00:17:40,856
Yes. I was just about
to deliver it to...

270
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:43,661
...Dad. Well, carry on.

271
00:17:44,946 --> 00:17:48,302
Wait, before you see Annie,
can you come to my room?

272
00:17:48,617 --> 00:17:51,336
- What for?
- There's something I need to tell you.

273
00:17:53,955 --> 00:17:56,150
This may come as a surprise to you...

274
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:57,565
- Annie!
- Daphne!

275
00:17:57,793 --> 00:18:00,227
I told you to leave Dr Crane alone.

276
00:18:00,504 --> 00:18:04,941
- Yes, you wanted him all to yourself.
- I do not want him all to myself.

277
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,894
I see. It's a threesome you're after.

278
00:18:08,178 --> 00:18:10,487
Well, I don't do those anymore.

279
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:15,500
There's been a misunderstanding.

280
00:18:15,769 --> 00:18:18,602
I don't see how. You barged
into my room five minutes ago

281
00:18:18,897 --> 00:18:20,888
and told me how much you wanted me.

282
00:18:21,149 --> 00:18:23,299
- You did?
- Well, technically, yes.

283
00:18:23,568 --> 00:18:26,958
Then as soon as this one
bats her eyes, it's shove off, Annie.

284
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,113
This is the worst birthday
I've ever had.

285
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:34,963
Dr Crane, I'm so sorry.
I've ruined everything.

286
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:37,681
What I said to Annie, I can explain.

287
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:41,951
No, it's none of my business. I've had
enough embarrassment for one night.

288
00:18:45,549 --> 00:18:47,107
- Dr Crane.
- Daphne.

289
00:18:47,342 --> 00:18:49,492
- Frasier.
- I'm sorry. Wrong room.

290
00:18:49,761 --> 00:18:53,720
- Just get out of here right now.
- So it's this room I want then?

291
00:18:54,057 --> 00:18:56,173
- Just go.
- Yes, bye-bye. Sorry again.

292
00:18:59,855 --> 00:19:01,254
Bonsoir.

293
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:04,765
Guy.

294
00:19:04,985 --> 00:19:08,295
- You are not the Crane I want.
- You're not even the sex I want.

295
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:12,921
Where is Niles?

296
00:19:14,619 --> 00:19:16,610
Niles. Company.

297
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:21,324
What are you doing in here with Guy?

298
00:19:24,546 --> 00:19:27,140
Don't be jealous, Niles.
It's not how it looks.

299
00:19:34,598 --> 00:19:36,031
What?

300
00:19:36,725 --> 00:19:39,683
As much as I'd like to help you
sort this thing out,

301
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:44,494
there is a beautiful woman
in here who wants me desperately.

302
00:19:44,858 --> 00:19:47,008
- Annie.
- Go away. Get out.

303
00:19:47,277 --> 00:19:49,586
What's going on? Guy.

304
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:52,711
How dare you barge in on me
when I'm naked?

305
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:55,505
My father told me that were hot for me.

306
00:19:55,786 --> 00:19:58,459
- Your father did?
- Blame Daphne. She told him.

307
00:19:58,747 --> 00:20:00,703
I said she wanted your brother.

308
00:20:00,957 --> 00:20:04,347
Could Niles and l
please have some privacy?

309
00:20:05,253 --> 00:20:09,212
You're just putting the moves
on everyone, aren't you?

310
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:15,256
Would you kindly get out of my bed?
I am not gay, Guy.

311
00:20:15,597 --> 00:20:18,953
Acknowledge your true nature.
Stop chasing these lesbians.

312
00:20:19,267 --> 00:20:20,461
Lesbians?

313
00:20:22,896 --> 00:20:27,253
- Your father told me you wanted me.
- My father said I wanted you?

314
00:20:30,612 --> 00:20:33,445
Hold it down.
There are people here trying to sleep.

315
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:38,677
My ears must have popped.
I can hear again.

316
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:44,038
Well, good night, all.

317
00:20:50,215 --> 00:20:54,811
I suggest we all forget
this ever happened and just go to bed.

318
00:20:58,307 --> 00:21:00,457
Wait, everybody.

319
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:02,956
Let me see if I can get this straight.

320
00:21:04,771 --> 00:21:09,242
All the lust
coursing through this lodge tonight,

321
00:21:10,694 --> 00:21:14,369
all the hormones
virtually ricocheting offthe walls,

322
00:21:17,617 --> 00:21:19,608
and no one...

323
00:21:22,247 --> 00:21:24,477
...was chasing me?

324
00:21:33,717 --> 00:21:35,787
See you at breakfast.
