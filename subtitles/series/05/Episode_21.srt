1
00:00:09,725 --> 00:00:12,239
-Hey, howareyou, Doc?The usual?
- Please.

2
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:15,716
- I'll have my usual too.
- And thatwould be...?

3
00:00:16,898 --> 00:00:18,968
I come in every day.
You must remember.

4
00:00:19,234 --> 00:00:21,623
My usual is...

5
00:00:21,903 --> 00:00:23,222
a half-caf...

6
00:00:24,573 --> 00:00:26,211
cappuccino...

7
00:00:27,492 --> 00:00:29,847
- with a light dusting of...
- Nutmeg.

8
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,997
- Cinnamon.
- Got it.

9
00:00:33,123 --> 00:00:34,954
God, that's infuriating.

10
00:00:35,375 --> 00:00:38,287
- I come here as often as you do.
- Don't take it to heart.

11
00:00:38,587 --> 00:00:41,579
This person remembers me best.
The next person might...

12
00:00:41,882 --> 00:00:44,316
Oh, my God, you're Frasier Crane!

13
00:00:45,218 --> 00:00:49,291
- Could I bother you for an autograph?
- No, you can't. It's never a bother.

14
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,278
- I love your show.
- Thank you.

15
00:00:51,516 --> 00:00:53,825
I think you're the smartest guy
on Earth.

16
00:00:54,102 --> 00:00:58,061
Well, one does hear tales of a certain
wise man in Tibet, but why split hairs?

17
00:00:58,398 --> 00:01:00,468
- There you are.
- Thanks.

18
00:01:01,068 --> 00:01:02,103
Where was l?

19
00:01:02,319 --> 00:01:05,038
You were last seen hiking up Mount Ego.

20
00:01:07,783 --> 00:01:10,297
Enough.
You've yapped about it all morning.

21
00:01:10,577 --> 00:01:13,614
It's a stupid rule,
and it's foreigners who suffer for it.

22
00:01:13,914 --> 00:01:16,189
Another drive
on the wrong side ofthe road?

23
00:01:16,458 --> 00:01:17,573
No.

24
00:01:18,251 --> 00:01:21,926
It's about my friend Xena.
You don't want to hear about it.

25
00:01:22,673 --> 00:01:23,822
Hey, Dad.

26
00:01:24,049 --> 00:01:25,607
- Xena. The Greek woman?
- Yes.

27
00:01:25,842 --> 00:01:29,118
We're planning a trip together.
Her mother's taking a cruise,

28
00:01:29,429 --> 00:01:33,217
and her ship will dock in Mazatlan for
a week. She's invited us to join her,

29
00:01:33,558 --> 00:01:36,356
only I can't go because
my bloody passport's expired.

30
00:01:36,645 --> 00:01:39,478
Don't give up hope.
We'll get you across that border.

31
00:01:39,773 --> 00:01:42,412
If I have to,
I'll snuggle you under an old blanket.

32
00:01:43,568 --> 00:01:46,480
- Don't you mean smuggle?
- I'm using code language.

33
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:48,418
You can't be too careful.

34
00:01:49,908 --> 00:01:51,387
- There you go.
- Thank you.

35
00:01:51,618 --> 00:01:53,848
- Ma'am?
- Thanks. I've already ordered.

36
00:01:54,121 --> 00:01:57,033
- Oh, I'm sorry. You had the...
- Absent-minded waiter.

37
00:01:57,332 --> 00:01:59,129
I'll get it myself.

38
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:07,567
Roz called to remind you about
your meeting with the station manager.

39
00:02:07,926 --> 00:02:11,805
Yes, that. He probably wants to discuss
my 1,000th radio broadcast.

40
00:02:12,139 --> 00:02:14,653
- It's next week.
- You've done a thousand shows?

41
00:02:14,933 --> 00:02:17,845
Yes. If I know the station manager,
he'll want to mark it

42
00:02:18,145 --> 00:02:21,615
with a gaudy celebration/
press, parties, God knows what.

43
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:25,296
No, I've never gone in
for that self-congratulatory hoopla.

44
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:28,522
- The work is the thing for me.
- Still, a thousand shows.

45
00:02:28,822 --> 00:02:31,131
- That's quite an achievement.
- I suppose.

46
00:02:31,408 --> 00:02:34,161
- Who'd have thought?
- Not me, that's for damn sure.

47
00:02:35,787 --> 00:02:38,381
Yeah, those first two weeks, p.u.!
Open a window.

48
00:02:38,665 --> 00:02:39,780
All right!

49
00:02:43,253 --> 00:02:45,608
- Hey, morning, Roz.
- Morning, Bulldog.

50
00:02:45,881 --> 00:02:51,080
Oh, my gosh! Look what Frasier
got for me. He's so cute.

51
00:02:52,346 --> 00:02:56,498
"Dear Roz, a huggy bear
for the mom-to-be. Love... Bulldog"?

52
00:02:57,768 --> 00:03:00,840
I guess I shoulda known
you'd think it was from Frasier.

53
00:03:01,146 --> 00:03:02,898
- I'm so sorry, Bulldog.
- It's OK.

54
00:03:03,148 --> 00:03:05,059
I'm not the warmest guy in the world,

55
00:03:05,317 --> 00:03:07,353
but when it comes to kids
I get kinda...

56
00:03:07,611 --> 00:03:10,079
Oh, Bulldog, come here.

57
00:03:10,364 --> 00:03:11,877
Come here.

58
00:03:15,786 --> 00:03:18,175
Whoa, you're gonna make a good mother,
Roz.

59
00:03:19,873 --> 00:03:22,182
Thank you, Bulldog. That's so sweet.

60
00:03:26,004 --> 00:03:27,483
Bulldog?

61
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,774
- Oh, get off me!
- What?

62
00:03:31,051 --> 00:03:33,246
You wanted to hug
because my breasts are bigger!

63
00:03:33,512 --> 00:03:36,470
No, I was just trying
to feel a little kick.

64
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,237
Get out!

65
00:03:39,476 --> 00:03:40,955
Pervert!

66
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:45,232
Morning, Roz.
I got you one ofthose muffins you love.

67
00:03:45,524 --> 00:03:47,515
You're not getting a hug!

68
00:03:49,277 --> 00:03:51,871
I see those mood swings
have levelled off nicely.

69
00:03:52,781 --> 00:03:55,090
I'll just go and have that meeting
with Greg.

70
00:03:55,367 --> 00:03:58,484
It's cancelled. He wanted to talk
about your 1,000th show,

71
00:03:58,787 --> 00:04:02,621
- but I ran into him and I handled it.
- All right, let me have it.

72
00:04:03,417 --> 00:04:06,056
What kind of a circus am I in for?

73
00:04:06,336 --> 00:04:08,531
I suppose a garish outdoor rally

74
00:04:08,797 --> 00:04:11,630
Iike the one they gave for Bob and Nipsy
over at KTLK?

75
00:04:11,925 --> 00:04:15,474
I told him just what you said,
about how the work is its own reward.

76
00:04:15,804 --> 00:04:17,681
So you're off the hook.

77
00:04:17,931 --> 00:04:20,161
- They're not doing anything?
- Nope.

78
00:04:21,393 --> 00:04:24,829
Well, well done, Roz. That's a relief.

79
00:04:27,149 --> 00:04:28,741
Although...

80
00:04:30,527 --> 00:04:33,087
I'm not sure I'm being quite fair
to you, you see.

81
00:04:33,363 --> 00:04:37,515
I did hear that after that rally, Bob
and Nipsy's ratings went up 30 per cent.

82
00:04:37,868 --> 00:04:42,180
The producer got a handsome raise.
And you, with the little one coming...

83
00:04:42,539 --> 00:04:44,973
- Well, it's too late now.
- Right.

84
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:48,003
Can't be helped.
Best to just leave it alone.

85
00:04:48,295 --> 00:04:49,489
Still...

86
00:04:49,713 --> 00:04:52,102
there is the benefit to the station.

87
00:04:52,382 --> 00:04:54,532
What's good for KACL
is good for all of us.

88
00:04:54,801 --> 00:04:55,790
That's true.

89
00:04:56,011 --> 00:04:58,923
I suppose you could call Greg
and tell him I'd be willing,

90
00:04:59,222 --> 00:05:03,613
for your sake and the station's,
to submit to a small, tasteful,...

91
00:05:05,228 --> 00:05:07,503
Iow-key public rally.

92
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:15,152
I just want to renew my passport.

93
00:05:15,447 --> 00:05:18,519
No, I'm a resident alien
here from England.

94
00:05:18,825 --> 00:05:21,498
You know,
the country that used to own you people?

95
00:05:22,621 --> 00:05:24,976
You'll go right to
the head ofthe line now.

96
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:27,713
I can't wait two weeks.

97
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:31,747
Myfriend Xena's flying down
to meet her mum's ship Sunday.

98
00:05:32,506 --> 00:05:35,896
Don't you put me on hold again!
I'll hang up! I mean it!

99
00:05:37,427 --> 00:05:39,418
I showed him!

100
00:05:41,932 --> 00:05:43,684
Well, it's official.

101
00:05:43,934 --> 00:05:47,404
My 1,000th show is now an event.

102
00:05:47,729 --> 00:05:51,119
- What's going on?
- Oh, nothing short of a media circus

103
00:05:51,441 --> 00:05:53,591
with you-know-who in the centre ring.

104
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:56,852
They're planning a promotional
blitzkrieg, capped off

105
00:05:57,155 --> 00:06:00,431
by a public rally in my honour
at the foot ofthe Space Needle.

106
00:06:00,742 --> 00:06:02,937
Wow! That's great!
You must be thrilled.

107
00:06:03,203 --> 00:06:06,434
Of course I'm flattered.
I'm just a little bit embarrassed.

108
00:06:06,748 --> 00:06:09,546
I'd be content with a pat on the back
and an ice cream.

109
00:06:11,545 --> 00:06:14,617
Dad, they've asked ifyou might say
a few words at the rally.

110
00:06:14,923 --> 00:06:16,959
You don't have to
ifyou'd be nervous.

111
00:06:17,217 --> 00:06:21,813
Oh, no problem. I can't tell ya how many
retirement dinners I've spoken at.

112
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,898
I've still got my old joke book,

113
00:06:24,141 --> 00:06:27,372
1,001 Side-Splitters, Rib Ticklers
and Thigh-Slappers.

114
00:06:28,645 --> 00:06:32,160
I'm sure you're a veritable
chiropractor of mirth, but...

115
00:06:32,482 --> 00:06:35,997
I think they're looking for
something just a bit more personal.

116
00:06:37,237 --> 00:06:40,786
Hello? All right, Roz, slow down.

117
00:06:43,076 --> 00:06:45,271
Oh, good Lord, the mayor?

118
00:06:46,997 --> 00:06:50,672
Well, has Frasier Fever
swept all the way to City Hall?

119
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:55,088
Well!
All right, Roz, I'll see you tomorrow.

120
00:06:56,715 --> 00:06:59,832
- The mayor's going to be there?
- Yes. And not just be there,

121
00:07:00,135 --> 00:07:02,569
he's going to present me
with a key to the city.

122
00:07:02,846 --> 00:07:05,963
And he's going to proclaim it
Frasier Crane Day in Seattle.

123
00:07:06,266 --> 00:07:07,415
Way to go, kid!

124
00:07:08,018 --> 00:07:10,407
Who can this be?

125
00:07:11,355 --> 00:07:14,552
Some mechanic from the Vatican
with my Pope Mobile?

126
00:07:16,693 --> 00:07:18,888
- Niles!
- Frasier, dinner's on me.

127
00:07:19,154 --> 00:07:21,190
I got some very good news today.

128
00:07:21,448 --> 00:07:23,803
Your brother
just got some good news, too.

129
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:27,068
Not so good as mine, I suspect.
First, I have to apologise

130
00:07:27,371 --> 00:07:30,204
for being snippy this morning.
I felt eclipsed lately,

131
00:07:30,499 --> 00:07:32,774
but that vanished
when I reached my office

132
00:07:33,043 --> 00:07:36,831
for what was waiting on my desk
but a gift from the self-esteem fairy.

133
00:07:39,633 --> 00:07:41,942
The American Journal of Psychiatry.

134
00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:46,053
I refer you to the Letters page.
Third one down.

135
00:07:47,641 --> 00:07:51,316
"Dear Sirs, Dr Egmont Sanderling's
recent article on Trichotillomania

136
00:07:51,645 --> 00:07:53,363
contained several errors."

137
00:07:53,605 --> 00:07:56,438
"He should read the ground-breaking work
on the subject

138
00:07:56,733 --> 00:07:59,327
by Dr Alan Caldwell,
Dr Milo Lauderstein..."

139
00:07:59,611 --> 00:08:01,681
Skip to the end.

140
00:08:03,532 --> 00:08:06,171
"...Dr Geraldine Fennelly
and Dr Niles Crane."

141
00:08:09,496 --> 00:08:11,327
Not too shabby, eh?

142
00:08:12,374 --> 00:08:14,046
That's quite an accolade.

143
00:08:14,292 --> 00:08:17,841
Yes, I had no idea you were such
a well-known expert on the...

144
00:08:18,171 --> 00:08:20,082
thing the letter mentioned.

145
00:08:21,675 --> 00:08:24,553
And the way they saved you for last
so you stand out.

146
00:08:26,471 --> 00:08:30,544
Nothing to kick away the clouds like
a heady sip from the goblet of fame.

147
00:08:31,601 --> 00:08:34,593
I told Jean-Claude to start
my victory martini-shaking

148
00:08:34,896 --> 00:08:37,490
- at precisely eight o'clock.
- Offwe go then.

149
00:08:37,774 --> 00:08:39,890
You had some news yourself. Do tell.

150
00:08:40,152 --> 00:08:42,985
Well, let's just wait
for that martini, shall we?

151
00:08:52,873 --> 00:08:54,591
Happy Frasier Crane Day.

152
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,412
Or is it Merry Frasier Crane Day?
I can never remember.

153
00:08:59,838 --> 00:09:03,387
- Very amusing.
- I'll have a half-caf cappuccino.

154
00:09:03,717 --> 00:09:05,548
Sorry I'm late. I stopped halfway

155
00:09:05,802 --> 00:09:08,874
to listen to a jolly band
of Frasier Crane Day carollers.

156
00:09:12,434 --> 00:09:15,312
I tried to join in on
The Twelve Days ofFrasier, but...

157
00:09:18,357 --> 00:09:21,315
forgot the words around day seven.
How does it go again?

158
00:09:22,319 --> 00:09:24,628
I believe it's "seven snobs a-sniping."

159
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:30,300
Snipe away. I take your jealousy
as the compliment that it is.

160
00:09:30,619 --> 00:09:33,770
A little affectionate joshing
doesn't mean I'm jealous.

161
00:09:34,081 --> 00:09:36,720
- I'm nothing but happy for you.
- Thank you, Niles.

162
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,278
You know, I'm just a touch skittish
today. All this fuss over me.

163
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:44,622
Say, is it possible
to get these two to go?

164
00:09:44,925 --> 00:09:47,439
We're not due at the Space Needle
for an hour.

165
00:09:47,719 --> 00:09:50,631
I thought a walk might do us good.
Get a little exercise.

166
00:09:50,931 --> 00:09:53,126
Then maybe I can stroll away my jitters.

167
00:09:53,392 --> 00:09:56,031
OK, I could use the fresh air.
I feel a tad sluggish.

168
00:09:56,311 --> 00:09:58,142
- Up late last night?
- I'm afraid so.

169
00:09:58,397 --> 00:10:02,390
As usual, I left it to the last minute
to write all my Frasier Crane Day cards.

170
00:10:12,411 --> 00:10:15,448
What a lovely day.
I'm so glad we decided to walk.

171
00:10:15,747 --> 00:10:18,261
- I feel calmer already.
- Hey, Doc, way to go!

172
00:10:19,543 --> 00:10:20,976
I'm listening!

173
00:10:22,004 --> 00:10:25,280
I just hope Dad doesn't get too nervous
about his speech today.

174
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:27,740
I've been giving him
little tips all week.

175
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:30,808
As Daphne tells it,
you wrote the whole thing for him.

176
00:10:31,096 --> 00:10:34,850
I did no such thing! I added a bon mot
or two, tidied up the language,

177
00:10:35,183 --> 00:10:37,174
removed any questionable material.

178
00:10:37,436 --> 00:10:40,473
- Not a word of his left, is there?
- Not a comma.

179
00:10:40,772 --> 00:10:42,171
I'm listening!

180
00:10:42,649 --> 00:10:45,243
Here's a tip.
The ones with cameras are tourists.

181
00:10:45,527 --> 00:10:48,758
They have no idea who you are,
much less why you're listening.

182
00:10:49,072 --> 00:10:51,381
The man clearly waved to me first.

183
00:10:51,658 --> 00:10:53,376
- He didn't wave at you.
- He did.

184
00:10:53,618 --> 00:10:56,086
- He was waving...
- Why are you even objecting?

185
00:10:56,371 --> 00:10:59,329
...for a cab to get away
from the scary "listening" man.

186
00:11:01,835 --> 00:11:07,228
I love this place.
Here you can feel the pulse of the city.

187
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:11,645
You know what I think when I see all
these people here bustling about?

188
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:14,279
Low turnout over at Frasier Crane Day?

189
00:11:15,641 --> 00:11:20,192
No. I think that they're the reason
I love this city.

190
00:11:22,189 --> 00:11:24,987
- Stop waving.
- Nothing wrong with being friendly.

191
00:11:25,275 --> 00:11:29,314
There is a difference between friendly
and making a spectacle ofyourself.

192
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,935
That man tried to assault me
with a fish!

193
00:11:34,201 --> 00:11:37,398
Niles, get a grip! For God's sake,
you become hysterical

194
00:11:37,704 --> 00:11:39,217
over the littlest things.

195
00:11:39,456 --> 00:11:43,005
My suede shoes. You've spilled latte
over them! They're ruined!

196
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:46,372
I'm sorry.
And it was a half-caf cappuccino.

197
00:11:46,672 --> 00:11:48,788
Why can no one remember that?

198
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:52,625
I'll have to replace them.
I'll look foolish otherwise.

199
00:11:52,928 --> 00:11:55,965
Never have I heard such caterwauling
over a pair of shoes.

200
00:11:56,264 --> 00:11:58,778
I spent a bundle on these.
They're Joan and David.

201
00:11:59,059 --> 00:12:01,095
- You named them?
- Oh, shut up!

202
00:12:03,105 --> 00:12:07,018
Well, these are quite handsome,
even if they're just a bit snug.

203
00:12:07,776 --> 00:12:10,449
You can go back.
There's a pair you didn't try on.

204
00:12:10,737 --> 00:12:12,887
Nonsense. We weren't in there that long.

205
00:12:13,156 --> 00:12:17,388
Oh, God, the rally's about to start.
Give me your phone. I'll call Roz.

206
00:12:19,579 --> 00:12:21,456
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

207
00:12:24,501 --> 00:12:26,219
Hello?

208
00:12:26,461 --> 00:12:28,577
Frasier, do you know what time it is?

209
00:12:28,839 --> 00:12:31,637
Where the hell are you?
We're on the air in two minutes!

210
00:12:31,925 --> 00:12:35,315
I'm sorry.
I was involved in a small accident.

211
00:12:35,637 --> 00:12:38,993
I'm fine. Just start without me.
We'll take a cab.

212
00:12:39,308 --> 00:12:42,106
- We'll have better luck at the corner.
- Right.

213
00:12:42,394 --> 00:12:45,670
Niles, wait! Too many fans that way.
I'll be mobbed.

214
00:12:45,981 --> 00:12:49,178
We're better off cutting over one block
through that alley.

215
00:12:51,445 --> 00:12:54,357
Frasier's running late,
I've got to use you first, OK?

216
00:12:54,656 --> 00:12:57,966
Yeah, sure, OK. Geez,
I was hopin' for a little more time.

217
00:12:58,285 --> 00:13:01,197
I haven't even looked at the stuff
Frasier wrote for me.

218
00:13:01,496 --> 00:13:05,091
Good afternoon, everyone,
and welcome also to our radio listeners.

219
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:08,090
I'm Roz Doyle,
and I'd like to thank you all

220
00:13:08,378 --> 00:13:11,688
for helping us congratulate
Dr Frasier Crane.

221
00:13:14,426 --> 00:13:16,064
We've got a full programme...

222
00:13:16,303 --> 00:13:19,420
Stop worrying.
Dr Crane's a very good writer.

223
00:13:19,723 --> 00:13:22,191
Look at this.
I'll die up there with this crap.

224
00:13:22,476 --> 00:13:25,195
Sadly, our guest ofhonour
has been detained,

225
00:13:25,479 --> 00:13:30,109
but we do have the next best thing,
his dad, Martin Crane.

226
00:13:34,905 --> 00:13:36,133
Thanks, Roz.

227
00:13:36,365 --> 00:13:37,798
Good afternoon.

228
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:42,170
22 years ago, my son Frasier came to me

229
00:13:42,496 --> 00:13:45,568
and asked if I would put him
through medical school.

230
00:13:45,874 --> 00:13:47,705
I agreed to pay for it,

231
00:13:47,959 --> 00:13:50,837
but remarked,
"I should have my head examined. "

232
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:55,676
Frasier replied, "Give me eight years,
and I'll do it for you. "

233
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,912
It was a hard eight years for Frasier,
but as someone once quipped,

234
00:14:04,267 --> 00:14:08,306
"A good psychiatrist never shrinks
from a challenge. "

235
00:14:14,736 --> 00:14:16,374
Oh, geez...

236
00:14:19,449 --> 00:14:21,599
For God's sake, Niles,
come out of there.

237
00:14:21,868 --> 00:14:25,463
Our mugger specifically
instructed us to wait for five minutes.

238
00:14:25,789 --> 00:14:29,702
If he'd intended us to time it exactly,
he wouldn't have taken our watches!

239
00:14:31,128 --> 00:14:34,803
All right, calm down. I can see
you're new to this whole mugging thing.

240
00:14:35,132 --> 00:14:38,647
I can't believe I'm missing my own
rally. These shoes are killing me!

241
00:14:38,969 --> 00:14:41,881
They're like the work of a skilled
Chinese footbinder.

242
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:45,377
Niles, give me your phone.
I'll have Roz send us a car.

243
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:48,881
What do you think the mugger
reached into my breast pocket for?

244
00:14:49,187 --> 00:14:52,862
The only consolation is he jabbed
himself on my emergency sewing kit.

245
00:14:53,191 --> 00:14:55,227
Niles, a pay phone!

246
00:14:56,194 --> 00:14:59,072
It's not much use to us
unless we can find a quarter.

247
00:15:03,327 --> 00:15:05,795
Niles, look.

248
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:09,037
You cannot be serious.
You want to rob that poor old man?

249
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:11,164
- We'll pay him back.
- He's blind.

250
00:15:11,418 --> 00:15:15,252
I know. It's the first break
we've had today. I'll distract him.

251
00:15:18,091 --> 00:15:19,763
Good afternoon!

252
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:25,686
Sounding lovely.

253
00:15:29,019 --> 00:15:31,453
- Stop! Thief!
- Dear God, run!

254
00:15:38,236 --> 00:15:40,830
I'd like to thank Frasier Crane
for his friendship...

255
00:15:41,114 --> 00:15:43,184
Excuse me, Mayor Rice?

256
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:45,918
- Yes?
- I have a small bone to pick with you.

257
00:15:46,203 --> 00:15:49,673
I can't say I care for the way your city
treats us poor aliens.

258
00:15:49,998 --> 00:15:51,829
- You're an alien?
- Daphne Moon.

259
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:54,882
You see, my friend Xena and l...
She's an alien too...

260
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:58,287
...want to get to Mazatlan
to meet her mother's ship.

261
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:00,342
- Her mothership?
- Yes.

262
00:16:00,592 --> 00:16:02,822
From what I hear,
it's quite spectacular.

263
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:05,484
I'm sure it is.
Go with these two gentlemen.

264
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:08,722
- They can take care ofyou.
- Well, thank you very much.

265
00:16:09,017 --> 00:16:11,406
- Hello. Do you two work for the mayor?
- Yes.

266
00:16:11,687 --> 00:16:15,202
I suppose I should know that already.
You see, I'm a bit psychic.

267
00:16:18,068 --> 00:16:20,138
Stop, Niles! Stop!

268
00:16:20,612 --> 00:16:23,888
I can't go on any longer.
My feet are killing me.

269
00:16:24,199 --> 00:16:27,555
We lost 'em. Most ofthem dropped out
after the first corner,

270
00:16:27,869 --> 00:16:30,941
but that short one with the pigtails
was a regular gazelle.

271
00:16:32,165 --> 00:16:36,044
Look, it's even farther away
than it was before.

272
00:16:36,378 --> 00:16:39,814
Frasier, the Monorail!
It goes to the Space Needle.

273
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:41,724
Let's go!

274
00:16:46,263 --> 00:16:48,652
Welcome to the Seattle Monorail.

275
00:16:48,932 --> 00:16:52,083
- Do you think anyone saw us sneak on?
- I think we're all right.

276
00:16:52,394 --> 00:16:56,148
I hate to say it, but it was sort of
exciting, flouting the law like that.

277
00:16:57,399 --> 00:17:01,233
It gives you some idea of why outlaws
are always such romantic figures.

278
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:03,561
You might have cut a more dashing figure

279
00:17:03,822 --> 00:17:06,780
had you vaulted the turnstile
and not crawled underneath.

280
00:17:07,075 --> 00:17:10,784
I'm surprised the trains
are even running on Frasier Crane Day.

281
00:17:12,998 --> 00:17:16,991
Yes, well, with any luck we'll still
catch the last 20 minutes ofthe rally.

282
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:19,930
Though how I'll explain my lateness,
I have no idea.

283
00:17:20,213 --> 00:17:23,922
I certainly can't tell them
about the fish, the little girls.

284
00:17:25,052 --> 00:17:28,408
I can make something up, I suppose.
Any suggestions?

285
00:17:28,722 --> 00:17:31,282
- The train stopped.
- That's not very original.

286
00:17:31,558 --> 00:17:33,708
No, Frasier, the train stopped.

287
00:17:33,977 --> 00:17:36,366
...people to be open about it.

288
00:17:36,647 --> 00:17:39,400
What's going on?
Excuse me, what's happening?

289
00:17:39,691 --> 00:17:42,159
Electrical problem ahead.
We're going back.

290
00:17:42,444 --> 00:17:44,878
What?
But those people are waiting for me.

291
00:17:45,155 --> 00:17:48,227
- They're so close.
- I guess it just isn't your day.

292
00:17:48,533 --> 00:17:50,091
But it is my day!

293
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:54,203
- Don't panic, Frasier.
- Oh, don't panic?

294
00:17:55,248 --> 00:17:57,125
Yes, why should I panic?

295
00:17:57,376 --> 00:17:59,970
I'm only missing a celebration
in my own honour,

296
00:18:00,253 --> 00:18:02,130
making me a laughing stock. And why?

297
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:05,293
- You spilled coffee on my shoes!
- You're blaming me?

298
00:18:05,592 --> 00:18:08,948
Ifyou had the gripping ability every
species above the tree sloth has...

299
00:18:09,262 --> 00:18:12,140
You should think back on the 45 minutes
you and your ego

300
00:18:12,432 --> 00:18:15,822
spent in that shoe store
trying on every pair of shoes!

301
00:18:16,144 --> 00:18:19,500
- Are you calling me vain?
- lfthe Joan and David fits!

302
00:18:30,492 --> 00:18:32,562
I don't even know
why I'm yelling at you.

303
00:18:32,828 --> 00:18:36,662
I guess I'm just trying to blame you
because I don't want to face the truth.

304
00:18:36,999 --> 00:18:39,069
I'm a big fat phoney.

305
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:46,198
I wanted my day.
I wanted hoopla and fuss.

306
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:50,478
I practically planned
the whole thing myself.

307
00:18:50,762 --> 00:18:52,673
- You did?
- Yes.

308
00:18:54,016 --> 00:18:57,008
Says a lot about me as a psychiatrist,
doesn't it?

309
00:18:58,895 --> 00:19:01,250
I'm a small man.

310
00:19:01,523 --> 00:19:05,755
Well, what does it say about me that
I was happy seeing you miss your day?

311
00:19:06,486 --> 00:19:08,397
- You were?
- Of course.

312
00:19:08,655 --> 00:19:12,773
I've been jealous ofyou all week.
I'm a tiny man.

313
00:19:13,368 --> 00:19:16,883
- Next to me, you're a giant.
- I stare up at your ankles.

314
00:19:17,205 --> 00:19:20,038
- I'd need a stepladder just to...
- Let's not do this.

315
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:27,766
You shouldn't feel guilty, Frasier.
Everyone deserves a fuss. You above all.

316
00:19:28,842 --> 00:19:32,835
You've helped a lot of people. They
deserve a chance to thank you for it.

317
00:19:34,681 --> 00:19:36,319
Thank you, Niles.

318
00:19:41,938 --> 00:19:45,374
Dr Crane is on his way
and should be here any minute.

319
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,356
There it goes.

320
00:19:52,407 --> 00:19:54,398
Goodbye, fuss.

321
00:19:56,828 --> 00:19:58,261
Goodbye, day.

322
00:20:06,046 --> 00:20:08,640
I hesitate to say this,
but you still have time...

323
00:20:08,924 --> 00:20:11,484
Stop it!
Don't you dare get my hopes up!

324
00:20:12,469 --> 00:20:15,939
That ship has sailed,
that fat lady has...

325
00:20:16,264 --> 00:20:17,822
Taxi! Taxi!

326
00:20:19,518 --> 00:20:24,308
- Oh, damn! I give up.
- Well, I don't. This is your day,

327
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:27,363
and if I can get you there
for a curtain call, I will.

328
00:20:27,651 --> 00:20:30,449
I still have the blind man's quarter.
I'll call a cab.

329
00:20:30,737 --> 00:20:32,967
Thank you, Niles. You're a good brother.

330
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:36,994
- Hey! Did I hear you yellin' for a cab?
- Yes!

331
00:20:37,327 --> 00:20:39,636
- I can take you if you want.
- Are you serious?

332
00:20:39,913 --> 00:20:42,381
- Yes.
- Niles! Niles, let's go! Come on!

333
00:20:46,628 --> 00:20:49,381
- What about your friend?
- Oh, he'll be all right.

334
00:20:49,673 --> 00:20:51,345
He's got street smarts.

335
00:20:51,591 --> 00:20:54,389
- Where are we going?
- The Space Needle, please.

336
00:20:54,678 --> 00:20:57,067
No problem.
Should be there in five minutes.

337
00:20:57,347 --> 00:20:59,736
That's the first good news
I've heard all day.

338
00:21:00,976 --> 00:21:03,570
I've been having
a pretty rough day myself.

339
00:21:03,854 --> 00:21:07,847
Yeah. My ex-wife
is getting remarried tomorrow.

340
00:21:08,191 --> 00:21:10,261
In Pennsylvania yet.

341
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:14,076
- You goin' to that rally over there?
- As a matter of fact, I am.

342
00:21:14,406 --> 00:21:18,524
Told her I'd come to the wedding,
but I've been getting cold feet.

343
00:21:19,202 --> 00:21:23,036
Better make up my mind soon, though.
My plane leaves in a few hours.

344
00:21:23,373 --> 00:21:27,082
They don't give you any bargains
on those last-minute tickets either.

345
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:29,569
Maybe this isn't the best time
to tell you

346
00:21:29,838 --> 00:21:31,874
but I'll have to owe you for this ride.

347
00:21:34,217 --> 00:21:36,048
Don't worry about it.

348
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:41,205
Probably never should have gotten
married in the first place.

349
00:21:41,516 --> 00:21:44,428
We were young.
Had a few good years, though.

350
00:21:44,728 --> 00:21:47,037
Well, that's something, at least.

351
00:21:48,023 --> 00:21:50,173
At least the kids
will be there tomorrow.

352
00:21:50,442 --> 00:21:53,240
- Kids?
- Son and a daughter.

353
00:21:54,154 --> 00:21:57,510
I don't see 'em much. They went
with their mom when we divorced.

354
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:02,356
Of course, I think I'm more excited
about seein' them

355
00:22:02,663 --> 00:22:06,212
- than they are about seein' me.
- Why would you say that?

356
00:22:07,626 --> 00:22:09,139
Just a feeling.

357
00:22:09,378 --> 00:22:12,814
I didn't make much of my life back
when Marie and I were together.

358
00:22:13,715 --> 00:22:16,627
Turned it around, though.
I own this car.

359
00:22:16,927 --> 00:22:20,317
Well, it's a nice one.

360
00:22:22,182 --> 00:22:26,778
The hardest part is, if I do go,
I have to see my in-laws.

361
00:22:27,145 --> 00:22:29,864
They were never too crazy about me.

362
00:22:30,148 --> 00:22:33,823
This new guy Marie is marrying is
supposed to be some kind of big success.

363
00:22:34,152 --> 00:22:36,268
I don't know what I'd say
to any of them.

364
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:40,284
Part of me thinks I'd just be better off
leaving the whole thing alone.

365
00:22:41,243 --> 00:22:44,758
- And part ofyou doesn't.
- I'd like to see my kids.

366
00:22:46,331 --> 00:22:48,845
Especially now
they're getting a new dad.

367
00:22:49,584 --> 00:22:51,461
Hell of a choice, huh?

368
00:22:51,712 --> 00:22:55,944
You know, sometimes difficult choices
like these can be good things.

369
00:22:57,801 --> 00:23:00,361
They can teach us about who we are.

370
00:23:08,645 --> 00:23:11,159
I've bent your ear enough about this.

371
00:23:12,107 --> 00:23:13,825
Besides, we're here.

372
00:23:14,067 --> 00:23:16,900
Oh, don't worry about me.
I've got plenty of time.

373
00:23:17,195 --> 00:23:21,029
- Tell me more about your kids.
- All right.

374
00:23:23,327 --> 00:23:26,364
- I'm John, by the way.
- I'm Frasier.

375
00:24:02,574 --> 00:24:04,371
So long, Seattle, we love you!
