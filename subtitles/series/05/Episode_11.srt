1
00:00:09,374 --> 00:00:11,365
-Frasier, Roz.
- Niles.

2
00:00:11,627 --> 00:00:15,063
- I'd join you butthere's not a chair.
- I was just leaving.

3
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:19,009
Niles, every time I give you my chair,
you wipe it off first.

4
00:00:19,343 --> 00:00:21,937
It's just insulting.

5
00:00:23,513 --> 00:00:26,550
For your information,
I was reaching for my cell phone.

6
00:00:28,393 --> 00:00:32,545
I'm sorry, Niles. I stepped out of line.
See you later, Frasier.

7
00:00:32,898 --> 00:00:33,887
Bye-bye, Roz.

8
00:00:36,568 --> 00:00:40,004
This is table seven. Could
you send someone to dust my chair?

9
00:00:40,322 --> 00:00:43,075
For God's sake, Niles. I'll do it.

10
00:00:43,367 --> 00:00:46,120
That's the most ridiculous thing
I've ever seen.

11
00:00:46,411 --> 00:00:48,402
Stop it. Just sit down.

12
00:00:51,542 --> 00:00:53,214
May I have one of those, please?

13
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,453
So, I understand you had
a full dance card this weekend.

14
00:00:57,798 --> 00:01:01,234
I met a lovely young artist
at the gallery opening on Saturday.

15
00:01:01,552 --> 00:01:05,181
We went out for coffee afterwards
and our date lasted until, well,

16
00:01:05,514 --> 00:01:07,744
the cows didn't actually come home

17
00:01:08,016 --> 00:01:10,211
but I did hear mooing
on the front porch.

18
00:01:11,853 --> 00:01:15,562
I'm drawing a blank. The only woman
I rememberyou chatting with

19
00:01:15,899 --> 00:01:20,131
was the one in the Birkenstocks who went
on and on about her driftwood collages.

20
00:01:20,487 --> 00:01:22,842
Yes, that's Caitlin.

21
00:01:23,115 --> 00:01:25,106
We seem different on the surface

22
00:01:25,367 --> 00:01:28,962
but once you get to know her,
she is a breath of fresh air.

23
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,152
I haven't felt this excited
about a relationship in ages.

24
00:01:33,458 --> 00:01:36,256
That's wonderful, Frasier.

25
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:39,188
So, is she from around here?

26
00:01:39,464 --> 00:01:42,456
- It didn't come up.
- I see.

27
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:45,796
- Where did she go to school?
- She didn't mention it.

28
00:01:49,057 --> 00:01:51,048
Probably art school.

29
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:55,223
Being an artist, I'm sure she
is enthusiastic about the finer things.

30
00:01:55,564 --> 00:01:58,522
- Literature, music...
- We never got around to that.

31
00:01:58,817 --> 00:02:01,206
I think I'm putting you
on the spot here.

32
00:02:01,486 --> 00:02:05,638
Let's just leave it at congratulations
on your new relationship.

33
00:02:05,991 --> 00:02:07,265
What are you implying?

34
00:02:07,492 --> 00:02:11,167
I think we both know what kind
of relationship we're talking about.

35
00:02:11,496 --> 00:02:15,535
Would you stop saying the word
"relationship" that way?

36
00:02:15,876 --> 00:02:18,868
I'm not condemning you
for your little fling.

37
00:02:20,672 --> 00:02:22,788
Don't pass it off as something deeper.

38
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:25,518
All you have in common
is the faint impression

39
00:02:25,802 --> 00:02:28,032
ofthe word "Sealy" on your backsides.

40
00:02:32,059 --> 00:02:35,734
I wouldn't stay in a relationship
ifthere was no future in it.

41
00:02:36,063 --> 00:02:40,261
So ifyou had nothing in common
beyond the physical, you'd break it off?

42
00:02:40,609 --> 00:02:43,282
Yes, absolutely.
It's a principle of mine.

43
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:47,643
This topic comes up all the time
on my show. What do I always say?

44
00:02:47,991 --> 00:02:51,188
- Surely you must listen occasionally.
- Of course.

45
00:02:51,495 --> 00:02:53,884
But I'm usually busy
between eleven and one.

46
00:02:54,164 --> 00:02:56,314
My show is on from two to five.

47
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:04,208
- Can't wait to see his face.
- Me, too. He doesn't have a clue.

48
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:05,539
All set.

49
00:03:20,566 --> 00:03:22,682
Let's do it together.

50
00:03:22,943 --> 00:03:24,296
Good boy.

51
00:03:25,404 --> 00:03:27,122
That was terrific.

52
00:03:28,282 --> 00:03:30,876
- I wonder if he made a wish.
- I know I did.

53
00:03:31,702 --> 00:03:33,181
- Niles.
- Hello, Frasier.

54
00:03:33,412 --> 00:03:36,370
Daphne, Dad.
We don't want to miss the previews.

55
00:03:36,665 --> 00:03:39,737
Come on, birthday boy.
I haven't given you your present.

56
00:03:40,043 --> 00:03:43,115
I got him a brand-new,
rubber eeseburger-chay.

57
00:03:45,632 --> 00:03:47,782
Frasier, can we convince you to join us?

58
00:03:48,051 --> 00:03:51,839
I don't think so. Your brother's
been slaving away in the kitchen.

59
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:54,375
I'm having Caitlin over for dinner.

60
00:03:56,894 --> 00:03:58,486
For dinner.

61
00:04:02,232 --> 00:04:05,941
And what would
you be preparing for dinner?

62
00:04:08,614 --> 00:04:10,844
Stop your sniggering insinuations

63
00:04:11,116 --> 00:04:14,153
that Caitlin and l
share nothing but the physical.

64
00:04:14,453 --> 00:04:16,444
There are manythings we share.

65
00:04:16,705 --> 00:04:17,694
Caitlin.

66
00:04:20,584 --> 00:04:22,814
Now they're sharing a Tic Tac.

67
00:04:24,796 --> 00:04:26,787
Let me take your coat.

68
00:04:27,049 --> 00:04:30,200
You remember Niles, of course.
And this is Daphne, Caitlin.

69
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:32,501
We'll be out ofyour way in a minute.

70
00:04:32,763 --> 00:04:35,152
As soon as I can tear
Mr Crane away from Eddie.

71
00:04:35,432 --> 00:04:38,265
Yes, he's having a birthday party
for his dog.

72
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,879
How old is he?

73
00:04:40,103 --> 00:04:42,742
Too old to be having a birthday party
for his dog.

74
00:04:43,774 --> 00:04:47,813
Can I interestyou in a drink? I've just
opened a bottle of Côte de Brouilly.

75
00:04:48,153 --> 00:04:52,465
You've been saving it. Bourgogne hasn't
made a decent Beaujolais in years.

76
00:04:52,824 --> 00:04:54,815
Do you hear that, Niles?

77
00:04:56,078 --> 00:04:58,592
Our Caitlin is a fellow oenophile.

78
00:04:58,872 --> 00:05:01,340
When I was little,
myfather owned a vineyard.

79
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:05,061
I would open a can of Hawaiian Punch
and let it breathe.

80
00:05:06,713 --> 00:05:09,671
And we share that same
quirky sense of humour.

81
00:05:09,967 --> 00:05:13,277
- Would you care for a glass?
- No. I hate the taste ofwine.

82
00:05:13,595 --> 00:05:16,826
Finally. Something I can use
to tell you two apart.

83
00:05:21,103 --> 00:05:22,377
Martini?

84
00:05:22,604 --> 00:05:25,072
I cut out alcohol
along with processed sugar,

85
00:05:25,357 --> 00:05:28,713
dairy products and meat.
I hope I'm not screwing up your menu.

86
00:05:29,027 --> 00:05:32,064
- What are you serving?
- Well, so far...

87
00:05:32,364 --> 00:05:33,877
parsley

88
00:05:35,158 --> 00:05:38,070
and curvy orange slices.

89
00:05:38,745 --> 00:05:42,294
But we'll make do. Let me get you
a glass of mineral water.

90
00:05:42,624 --> 00:05:46,742
Please, help yourself
to the melon slices. Just...

91
00:05:48,005 --> 00:05:49,996
unwind the prosciutto.

92
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:54,383
I owe you an apology.
You two are compatible.

93
00:05:54,678 --> 00:05:57,670
How long before
we're standing outside a wedding chapel

94
00:05:57,973 --> 00:06:00,931
pelting you both
with whole grain brown rice?

95
00:06:01,226 --> 00:06:03,694
Spare me your sarcasm.

96
00:06:03,979 --> 00:06:06,095
Let me have my fun. You're having yours.

97
00:06:06,356 --> 00:06:08,824
Even ifyou deny
that's what you're doing.

98
00:06:09,109 --> 00:06:10,827
I would never continue

99
00:06:11,069 --> 00:06:14,948
if I didn't feel that there was some
future in it. And I believe there is.

100
00:06:15,282 --> 00:06:17,318
Ever heard of opposites attracting?

101
00:06:17,576 --> 00:06:20,534
Where I am worldly,
Caitlin is unspoiled.

102
00:06:20,829 --> 00:06:23,946
Rather remarkable,
given her terror of preservatives.

103
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:29,038
Frasier, I just met your dad.
Did you know we're both Libras?

104
00:06:29,379 --> 00:06:34,055
Which explains why I'm so perky,
open-minded and quick to tears.

105
00:06:36,053 --> 00:06:38,965
- And don't forget outgoing.
- No, I didn't.

106
00:06:39,264 --> 00:06:40,458
Everybody coming?

107
00:06:40,682 --> 00:06:44,800
- It was nice meeting you all.
- Nice to meet you, too, Caitlin.

108
00:06:45,145 --> 00:06:47,136
Will you stop smirking?

109
00:06:47,397 --> 00:06:49,752
It'll take more
than dabbling in astrology

110
00:06:50,025 --> 00:06:52,061
to dim the charm ofthis young woman.

111
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,356
Oh, my God! This is the coolest chair.

112
00:06:58,075 --> 00:06:59,110
Just get out.

113
00:07:10,295 --> 00:07:13,844
- Morning, Frasier.
- Morning, Dad.

114
00:07:14,758 --> 00:07:16,430
What's the matter?

115
00:07:18,428 --> 00:07:19,827
It's Caitlin.

116
00:07:21,014 --> 00:07:22,333
I'm in hell.

117
00:07:24,101 --> 00:07:29,334
Last night I had the most intense
physical pleasure I've ever known.

118
00:07:29,731 --> 00:07:32,120
Frasier, before you continue,

119
00:07:33,402 --> 00:07:36,474
I shared my bed last night with a dog.

120
00:07:40,075 --> 00:07:42,430
That's not the problem, Dad.

121
00:07:42,703 --> 00:07:45,979
It's just there's absolutely no future
for me and Caitlin.

122
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:49,088
I never thought there was.
She's a flake.

123
00:07:49,376 --> 00:07:51,367
That's not the point.

124
00:07:51,628 --> 00:07:54,938
There are aspects of her personality
that I find off-putting.

125
00:07:55,257 --> 00:07:57,248
Like her being a flake.

126
00:07:58,427 --> 00:08:02,136
It's just difficult to walk away
from something so intoxicating.

127
00:08:02,472 --> 00:08:04,906
Fras, I'm going to say one thing.

128
00:08:05,183 --> 00:08:09,335
Watch out for this woman.
I know how these things work.

129
00:08:09,688 --> 00:08:13,044
- You experienced something like this?
- I didn't say that.

130
00:08:13,358 --> 00:08:17,874
I just know the type. Today, she's got
you going against your better judgement.

131
00:08:18,238 --> 00:08:21,355
Pretty soon you'll be
thinking about her all the time,

132
00:08:21,658 --> 00:08:26,288
Iosing sleep, missing work,
neglecting yourfriends.

133
00:08:28,707 --> 00:08:33,940
And then you'll get caught naked with
her in the back seat ofyour squad car.

134
00:08:39,801 --> 00:08:43,510
But, anyway, the point is
the longeryou put this off,

135
00:08:43,847 --> 00:08:46,042
the harder it'll be to end it.

136
00:08:47,684 --> 00:08:51,836
You're absolutely right, Dad.
Got to nip this thing in the bud.

137
00:08:52,189 --> 00:08:56,785
I'll go overthere now. Doing anything
else would make me a hypocrite.

138
00:08:57,152 --> 00:09:02,067
Justyesterday I dedicated an entire
showto the importance of self-control.

139
00:09:02,449 --> 00:09:05,327
- You did?
- Doesn't anybody listen?

140
00:09:13,835 --> 00:09:15,905
- Who is it?
- It's Frasier.

141
00:09:16,171 --> 00:09:21,450
Why didn't you call first?
I'm working on one of my collages.

142
00:09:21,843 --> 00:09:26,553
I'm covered in paint. I got turpentine
in my hair. I'm all sweaty.

143
00:09:26,932 --> 00:09:30,686
It'll only take a moment.
I need to talk to you about something.

144
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:33,658
All right, but be nice.

145
00:09:36,066 --> 00:09:38,022
Well, actually, l...

146
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:40,268
Good Lord, you really do look...

147
00:09:41,905 --> 00:09:42,894
Good Lord.

148
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:55,157
- Hey, Daphne, is Frasier here?
- No, he's not back yet.

149
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:58,452
He was supposed to meet me
to finish this paperwork.

150
00:09:58,755 --> 00:10:00,746
Now he can just do it himself.

151
00:10:01,008 --> 00:10:04,398
- Can I use our powder room?
- Yeah, of course.

152
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,349
Frasier's attempt to break up
with Caitlin has gone awry again.

153
00:10:08,682 --> 00:10:10,638
Now I've missed the wine tasting.

154
00:10:10,893 --> 00:10:14,249
What kind ofweak-willed man
allows a woman to come between him

155
00:10:14,563 --> 00:10:17,396
- and a 1981 Cheval Blanc?
- Just out of curiosity,

156
00:10:17,691 --> 00:10:21,923
why didn't you go by yourself instead
of sitting with me for half an hour?

157
00:10:24,448 --> 00:10:27,042
I was worried about him, Daphne,
worried sick.

158
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:33,434
Dr Crane.
Were you at Caitlin's all this time?

159
00:10:33,749 --> 00:10:37,628
Heavens, no,
I stopped by early this morning.

160
00:10:38,712 --> 00:10:41,510
We've decided to go our separate ways.

161
00:10:41,798 --> 00:10:45,552
And then I met up with Roz,
went over some paperwork.

162
00:10:45,886 --> 00:10:50,437
You know how she is. Get her on
one of her troubles and yak, yak, yak.

163
00:10:50,807 --> 00:10:53,275
And yet she makes
every story so interesting,

164
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,790
I could listen to her for hours.

165
00:10:56,104 --> 00:10:58,299
Where have you been?

166
00:10:58,565 --> 00:11:03,081
Where do you think I've been?
Trying to break up with Caitlin.

167
00:11:03,445 --> 00:11:05,913
But did I do it? No.

168
00:11:06,657 --> 00:11:10,206
And why?
Because I'm Frasier and I'm a sexoholic.

169
00:11:19,795 --> 00:11:24,152
It's obvious what's happening here.
You are having a purely sexual fling

170
00:11:24,508 --> 00:11:27,181
that happens to all of us
at some time in our lives.

171
00:11:27,469 --> 00:11:31,018
Where the chemistry is perfect,
where you can't be alone together

172
00:11:31,348 --> 00:11:35,182
without tearing each other's clothes off
and jumping each other.

173
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,510
Does this sound familiar?

174
00:11:38,522 --> 00:11:39,796
Yeah.

175
00:11:43,151 --> 00:11:46,621
Everyone's had a relationship like that.
I know I have.

176
00:11:46,947 --> 00:11:48,346
His name was...

177
00:11:49,616 --> 00:11:52,050
I can't tell you this.
It's too embarrassing.

178
00:11:52,327 --> 00:11:54,602
We're all friends here.

179
00:11:54,872 --> 00:11:57,511
I don't even remember all the details.

180
00:11:57,791 --> 00:11:59,429
Take a minute.

181
00:12:00,627 --> 00:12:06,065
It all started one afternoon when I was
sunbathing on the roof of our building.

182
00:12:06,466 --> 00:12:12,302
I was concerned about tan lines
so I decided to unhook my bikini top.

183
00:12:12,723 --> 00:12:14,395
I'll get it.

184
00:12:18,979 --> 00:12:24,531
Mine was this lifeguard. He had long,
blond hair and the bluest eyes.

185
00:12:24,943 --> 00:12:30,939
He used to get so sunburnt I'd spend
hours peeling the skin off his back.

186
00:12:31,909 --> 00:12:34,264
Whatwas his name?

187
00:12:34,536 --> 00:12:37,130
Rick? Nick?
I knowthere was an ick sound.

188
00:12:37,414 --> 00:12:39,564
I was about to make one ofthose myself.

189
00:12:40,876 --> 00:12:44,232
My mother picks the worst times to call.
Did I miss anything?

190
00:12:44,546 --> 00:12:48,255
- No. You were telling us a story.
- Yeah, that's right.

191
00:12:48,592 --> 00:12:51,868
Well, once I got my top off,
I started thinking to myself,

192
00:12:52,179 --> 00:12:56,934
I've never had an all-over tan.
So I looked to see if I was still alone.

193
00:12:57,309 --> 00:12:59,300
Then I started to slip off...

194
00:12:59,561 --> 00:13:01,153
The rolls are done.

195
00:13:04,274 --> 00:13:06,834
We haven't heard anything from you,
Niles.

196
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:10,546
I don't think we're exactly
in Niles' wheelhouse.

197
00:13:10,864 --> 00:13:12,343
I beg your pardon.

198
00:13:12,574 --> 00:13:15,611
I've heard your stories.
They're not the steamiest stuff.

199
00:13:15,911 --> 00:13:19,108
You've forgotten the semester
I spent living in Paris.

200
00:13:19,414 --> 00:13:21,723
I had a torrid affair
with a married woman.

201
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,070
- Really?
- I had no idea.

202
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:28,693
It's not something I boast about.
The attraction was simply overpowering.

203
00:13:29,049 --> 00:13:33,247
Every Thursday, two o'clock,
the Hotel de Boulogne.

204
00:13:33,595 --> 00:13:37,554
We'd arrive separately,
climb the stairs, open the door

205
00:13:37,891 --> 00:13:40,200
and ooh-la-la.

206
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:45,425
What an embrace.

207
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:47,602
Afterwards, she'd whisper to me,

208
00:13:47,859 --> 00:13:50,931
"There's something so sweet
in your eyes, and it..."

209
00:13:51,238 --> 00:13:54,389
"...does me so much good,"
said Emma Bovary.

210
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:01,579
If you're going to steal a love life,
don't steal from the classics.

211
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:09,101
The part about being in Paris is true.

212
00:14:09,923 --> 00:14:14,439
Got them out just in time. Another
minute and I would've had burnt buns.

213
00:14:14,803 --> 00:14:17,636
Which brings us back to your story.

214
00:14:17,931 --> 00:14:23,164
There I was wearing nothing but a smile
when the sun started to shift.

215
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:27,635
So I moved behind the water tower,
and who was lying there but Derrick,

216
00:14:27,983 --> 00:14:30,781
the good-looking fireman
from across the hall

217
00:14:31,069 --> 00:14:35,347
who was also getting an all-over tan,
I might add. So I had two choices.

218
00:14:35,699 --> 00:14:38,418
I could either tiptoe away or...

219
00:14:38,994 --> 00:14:40,825
- Tea.
- No, sit!

220
00:14:41,079 --> 00:14:43,752
Must Daphne do everything around here?

221
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:48,435
I'll get it. I could use
a glass of iced water anyway.

222
00:14:48,754 --> 00:14:52,030
You're not the only one.
Let me give you a hand.

223
00:14:52,341 --> 00:14:55,253
- Is any of this helping?
- Not much.

224
00:14:55,552 --> 00:14:59,306
I've got to make a point here.
For as long as I've known you,

225
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:02,598
you've been complaining
about your lack of a sex life.

226
00:15:02,893 --> 00:15:06,408
Now you have one,
so why are you still complaining?

227
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:10,200
It just seems wrong.
I've thought a lot about this...

228
00:15:10,525 --> 00:15:13,562
That's your problem.
You've thought too much about this.

229
00:15:13,862 --> 00:15:19,141
Why don't you stop listening to your
head and start listening to your body?

230
00:15:19,535 --> 00:15:23,164
You're enjoying this. Why
do you have to feel so guilty about it?

231
00:15:23,497 --> 00:15:25,772
I'm afraid I have no future with her.

232
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:27,030
So?

233
00:15:28,293 --> 00:15:30,602
Maybe she thinks
she has a future with me.

234
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:33,791
Then it would be wrong.
But is that how she feels?

235
00:15:34,091 --> 00:15:36,480
- I don't know.
- Ask her.

236
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:39,228
If she feels the same way,
just enjoy yourself.

237
00:15:39,513 --> 00:15:43,825
These things don't come around very
often and they don't last when they do.

238
00:15:44,184 --> 00:15:48,655
You're right. Over-thinking things
can certainly spoil anything.

239
00:15:49,022 --> 00:15:52,856
I gave the same advice on my show
to that lawyer from Bainbridge.

240
00:15:53,193 --> 00:15:55,912
- I don't remember that.
- You were five feet away.

241
00:15:56,196 --> 00:15:57,834
Doesn't anyone listen?

242
00:15:58,073 --> 00:16:00,462
It wasn't until afterwards
that we realised

243
00:16:00,742 --> 00:16:04,291
we'd rolled onto the skylight
above the main stairwell.

244
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:11,359
We took some ribbing about that.

245
00:16:37,487 --> 00:16:42,038
Everything's under control. Dinner
should be ready in about 20 minutes.

246
00:16:42,409 --> 00:16:45,606
- Smells wonderful.
- So do you.

247
00:16:45,913 --> 00:16:48,586
- Caitlin, you know...
- Yes?

248
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:53,064
I wanted to ask you,
where do you see this going?

249
00:16:53,378 --> 00:16:55,892
Right now I'm heading
to your earlobe

250
00:16:56,173 --> 00:17:00,769
but ifyou care to reroute me,
I'm open to suggestions.

251
00:17:01,136 --> 00:17:05,015
No, I mean our relationship.
We've never talked about it.

252
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:12,527
I don't know. I guess I was kind of
looking at this as a nice, casual thing.

253
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:16,694
- I hope that doesn't disappoint you.
- No, I'm actually relieved.

254
00:17:17,027 --> 00:17:19,541
I've been loving things
the way they are, too.

255
00:17:19,821 --> 00:17:24,417
- We're just having some fun, right?
- Fun doesn't begin to describe it.

256
00:17:24,785 --> 00:17:27,583
I wanted to make sure
we were both on the same page.

257
00:17:27,871 --> 00:17:30,988
Is that what's been on your mind
because you've been tense.

258
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:34,124
I even got some hot oil
to give you a massage.

259
00:17:34,419 --> 00:17:36,410
I guess we won't be needing that now.

260
00:17:36,672 --> 00:17:42,110
Well, I have been terribly worried
about this global warming situation.

261
00:17:42,511 --> 00:17:45,981
We've got some time before dinner.
I'll go get the oil.

262
00:17:47,182 --> 00:17:50,174
- I'm so glad we had this conversation.
- Yeah, me, too.

263
00:17:50,477 --> 00:17:54,595
I was starting to worry that
you were scared off by my lifestyle.

264
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:58,535
- I mean, I'm pretty out there.
- Oh, Caitlin...

265
00:18:00,404 --> 00:18:03,794
I'm not that narrow-minded.
We have a wonderful chemistry.

266
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:06,755
That's enough to offset
a few minor differences.

267
00:18:07,035 --> 00:18:09,424
You can be taking your shirt off.

268
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,030
Same goes, by the way.

269
00:18:14,251 --> 00:18:17,129
I just love these converted loft spaces.

270
00:18:17,421 --> 00:18:20,538
I wonder what this one was
before you moved in.

271
00:18:20,841 --> 00:18:24,959
Judging by these meat hooks,
I'd say a slaughterhouse, huh?

272
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:28,455
No, I put those in.
It was a day-care centre.

273
00:18:33,395 --> 00:18:37,513
You artists with your whimsical
decorating touches.

274
00:18:42,613 --> 00:18:44,604
That's a mousetrap, isn't it?

275
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:49,563
- Do you get many mice?
- I wish. I use them in my art.

276
00:18:53,582 --> 00:18:55,140
Dead mice?

277
00:18:55,375 --> 00:19:00,324
They're part of my newest collage
series. It's all about mortality.

278
00:19:03,133 --> 00:19:05,567
Caitlin, you've cut your hair.

279
00:19:05,844 --> 00:19:09,314
Yeah, sometimes the spirit
just grabs me and I've got to do it.

280
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,393
It's very freeing.
Plus, there's something great

281
00:19:12,684 --> 00:19:15,881
about using your body parts
for a practical use.

282
00:19:19,483 --> 00:19:21,474
Well, it's different.

283
00:19:21,735 --> 00:19:24,203
It's still beautiful, nonetheless.

284
00:19:24,488 --> 00:19:28,037
- Is that all your hair?
- It's mostly mine.

285
00:19:33,163 --> 00:19:37,600
- I'm thinking...
- No, don't think.

286
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:42,715
The secret to a good massage
is to let the mind rest

287
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:46,127
- and listen to the body.
- Right.

288
00:19:49,304 --> 00:19:52,262
Go ahead, body, I'm listening.

289
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:57,005
That feels good.

290
00:19:57,271 --> 00:20:02,186
Ifwe move to the bed, I could give you
a more thorough massage.

291
00:20:03,527 --> 00:20:06,087
I just remembered
it's a full moon tonight.

292
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:09,840
Look. Isn't that beautiful?

293
00:20:10,117 --> 00:20:14,076
How romantic. There's nothing like
a full moon to make one want to...

294
00:20:21,378 --> 00:20:22,367
Caitlin?

295
00:20:22,588 --> 00:20:25,261
I'm a member ofthe Lycanthrope Society.

296
00:20:25,549 --> 00:20:29,337
- As in werewolf?
- Not literally. It's a group ofwomen

297
00:20:29,678 --> 00:20:31,953
who believe the moon
controls our cycles.

298
00:20:32,222 --> 00:20:34,452
This is our way of paying our respects.

299
00:20:39,354 --> 00:20:41,424
Besides, you've heard me howl before.

300
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:45,649
Yes, but in that context,
I took it as a compliment.

301
00:20:47,821 --> 00:20:53,453
Frasier, you're getting all tense again.
It's the hair pillows, isn't it?

302
00:20:53,869 --> 00:20:56,542
Yes, that...

303
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,980
- Got one.
- Among other things.

304
00:21:00,834 --> 00:21:04,349
I'm starting to think
that maybe this isn't such a good idea.

305
00:21:04,671 --> 00:21:06,024
What do you mean?

306
00:21:06,256 --> 00:21:10,727
We're just so different. I'm basically
your stuffy, buttoned-down sort of guy.

307
00:21:11,094 --> 00:21:16,009
You're a free-spirited, mouse-painting,
moon-howling sort of girl.

308
00:21:17,976 --> 00:21:23,209
Is even the most satisfying sexual
relationship enough to bridge that gap?

309
00:21:23,607 --> 00:21:25,598
Well, I think so.

310
00:21:26,735 --> 00:21:28,851
What do you think?
