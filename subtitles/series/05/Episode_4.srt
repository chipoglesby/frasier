1
00:00:09,725 --> 00:00:14,276
Well, lookwho's here.
It's KACL's Frasier Crane.

2
00:00:14,646 --> 00:00:16,159
And Rosemary's Bebe.

3
00:00:18,275 --> 00:00:20,835
Quite a shake-up
going on down at the station.

4
00:00:21,111 --> 00:00:24,023
The new owner's
renegotiating everyone's contract.

5
00:00:24,323 --> 00:00:28,794
Before you drop another hint,
my feelings about you haven't changed.

6
00:00:29,161 --> 00:00:31,391
I'm here to meet
one of my newer clients,

7
00:00:31,663 --> 00:00:34,416
a rising star of the Seattle airwaves.

8
00:00:34,708 --> 00:00:37,745
What pathetic dupe
have you lured into your web?

9
00:00:38,045 --> 00:00:39,524
Roz.

10
00:00:40,255 --> 00:00:44,043
- Oh, dear God.
- You get offyour feet, little mother.

11
00:00:44,384 --> 00:00:47,376
I'll fetch you a nice nourishing muffin.

12
00:00:52,809 --> 00:00:55,881
- You signed to Bebe?
- OK, I should have told you.

13
00:00:56,188 --> 00:00:58,463
I wasn't in the mood for a lecture.

14
00:00:58,732 --> 00:01:01,644
You're entitled to choose
whoever you wish.

15
00:01:01,943 --> 00:01:03,934
Someone who's honest or whose ethics

16
00:01:04,196 --> 00:01:07,871
would've raised eyebrows
in the court of Caligula.

17
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,919
She's got me three voice-over jobs.

18
00:01:11,203 --> 00:01:14,240
She may be shifty
but she helps me put food on the table.

19
00:01:14,539 --> 00:01:16,530
- One muffin.
- See?

20
00:01:16,792 --> 00:01:18,783
I had a brainstorm

21
00:01:19,044 --> 00:01:23,435
about how
to turn this bundle of joy into cash.

22
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:25,391
Use my baby to make money?

23
00:01:25,634 --> 00:01:29,024
It's high time the little slacker
started pulling his weight.

24
00:01:30,138 --> 00:01:34,609
Dr Clint Webber's medical show.
I see a daily segment called

25
00:01:35,102 --> 00:01:40,051
A Pregnant Pause:
Roz Doyle's Term ofEndearment.

26
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:43,796
All of Seattle will share in the miracle
happening inside you.

27
00:01:44,111 --> 00:01:47,706
Your joys, hopes, morning sickness,
sonograms, even the birth.

28
00:01:48,031 --> 00:01:51,819
- I'll give birth on the air?
- It's radio. Just make the noises.

29
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,594
Hell, I'll make them myself.

30
00:01:56,748 --> 00:01:59,706
- Need anything else here?
- Just a shower, thank you.

31
00:02:00,627 --> 00:02:02,379
You know, Mr lntegrity,

32
00:02:02,629 --> 00:02:06,304
you still haven't hired anyone
to negotiate this big deal for you.

33
00:02:06,633 --> 00:02:10,069
Could it be because
you know you want to come back to me?

34
00:02:10,387 --> 00:02:13,026
I'm determined
to make the right choice.

35
00:02:13,307 --> 00:02:17,061
- You'll need somebody good.
- I intend to find someone good.

36
00:02:17,394 --> 00:02:19,385
It's possible to find an agent

37
00:02:19,646 --> 00:02:23,400
who can drive a hard bargain
and maintain high ethical standards.

38
00:02:23,734 --> 00:02:25,645
Happy hunting.

39
00:02:25,902 --> 00:02:28,780
Ifthings don't work out,
you know my number.

40
00:02:29,072 --> 00:02:31,063
Still 666, is it?

41
00:02:34,411 --> 00:02:38,689
Dad, we had a mix-up last night
with our bags at the video store.

42
00:02:39,041 --> 00:02:41,680
- Believe me, I noticed.
- There you go.

43
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:46,795
I was dismayed to see Charles Bronson
blowing away street trash.

44
00:02:48,383 --> 00:02:50,613
But it was quite suspenseful.

45
00:02:50,886 --> 00:02:54,322
That's the way Duke and I felt
about My Dinnerwith Andre.

46
00:02:56,016 --> 00:02:58,007
Talk about suspense.

47
00:02:58,268 --> 00:03:01,385
Will they order dessert?
Will they leave a good tip?

48
00:03:03,565 --> 00:03:06,159
- Hello, Niles.
- Frasier, sorry to trouble you

49
00:03:06,443 --> 00:03:09,355
but could you recommend
another couples therapist?

50
00:03:09,655 --> 00:03:12,169
What happened to Dr Prescott?

51
00:03:12,449 --> 00:03:16,567
Maris had me can Dr Prescott weeks ago.
Now she wants me to fire Dr Wilfong.

52
00:03:16,912 --> 00:03:20,268
- What's wrong with him?
- His criticism of her is too harsh.

53
00:03:20,582 --> 00:03:24,211
Some therapists can be rather blunt.
What did he say?

54
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:28,583
He asked her to refrain from
catalogue shopping during our sessions.

55
00:03:29,925 --> 00:03:34,396
Ifyou fire every therapist that finds
fault with her, you won't make progress.

56
00:03:34,763 --> 00:03:38,199
You're right. I'll tell her,
we're not going to change.

57
00:03:38,517 --> 00:03:39,950
- That's that.
- Good.

58
00:03:40,185 --> 00:03:43,621
There's nothing more rewarding
than sticking to a principle.

59
00:03:43,939 --> 00:03:49,935
Case in point, Bebe Glazer's been
angling to negotiate my new contract.

60
00:03:50,362 --> 00:03:53,320
I could have said yes,
taken the money and run.

61
00:03:53,615 --> 00:03:57,927
But, instead, I said no
and I found myself a new agent,

62
00:03:58,286 --> 00:04:01,084
one who's every bit as smart
and also ethical.

63
00:04:01,373 --> 00:04:03,011
That's him now.

64
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:07,163
I don't know what he said but there's
no such thing as an ethical agent.

65
00:04:07,504 --> 00:04:09,972
One's just as slimy as the other.

66
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:14,902
Hi. Sorry I'm late. I was making
my last Meals on Wheels delivery

67
00:04:15,262 --> 00:04:17,935
and I swerved to avoid a pigeon.

68
00:04:19,099 --> 00:04:22,933
Then splat went the food all over
the stuffed bears for the toy drive.

69
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:25,261
I had to throw the bears in the wash

70
00:04:25,522 --> 00:04:28,594
and cook some more borscht
for Mrs Popov.

71
00:04:29,818 --> 00:04:32,173
This is my brother, Dr Niles Crane. Ben.

72
00:04:32,446 --> 00:04:35,244
- Pleasure to meet you.
- I'm sorry I'm running out.

73
00:04:35,532 --> 00:04:38,763
You're a refreshing change
from Frasier's last agent.

74
00:04:39,077 --> 00:04:41,068
She would've swerved to hit the pigeon.

75
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:43,890
She would've swerved to hit Mrs Popov.

76
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:48,326
Ben, meet my dad, Martin, and this
is his home healthcare worker, Daphne.

77
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:51,787
- This is Ben, my new agent.
- Very nice to meet you.

78
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:54,240
You're a pretty busy volunteer.

79
00:04:54,509 --> 00:04:57,626
Ben just won
this year's Seattle Samaritan Award.

80
00:04:57,929 --> 00:05:00,887
Enough about me.
Let's talk about you. May l?

81
00:05:01,183 --> 00:05:03,174
Before we start this negotiation,

82
00:05:03,435 --> 00:05:07,633
it wouldn't hurt to raise your
public profile. OK, here's my plan.

83
00:05:07,981 --> 00:05:10,814
For a year I've worked
for the Mercer lsland Zoo.

84
00:05:11,109 --> 00:05:15,341
- Creating awareness.
- There's a zoo on Mercer lsland?

85
00:05:15,697 --> 00:05:18,086
You bet. This will be great PR
for both ofyou.

86
00:05:18,367 --> 00:05:20,597
They just bought a rare crane.

87
00:05:20,869 --> 00:05:25,021
I convinced them to name it after you.
You know, Frasier Crane.

88
00:05:25,374 --> 00:05:28,571
There'll be a ceremony
with full newspaper and TV coverage.

89
00:05:28,877 --> 00:05:33,234
It's brilliant. It bolsters my
bargaining position and helps out a zoo.

90
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:35,581
I love this man.

91
00:05:35,842 --> 00:05:38,356
It would be fun to have a crane
named after me.

92
00:05:38,637 --> 00:05:42,676
I just love those big pouchy mouths
they scoop up the fish in.

93
00:05:43,016 --> 00:05:45,246
- I think those are pelicans.
- Oh, right.

94
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:48,989
Cranes are the ones
who always sound like they're laughing.

95
00:05:49,314 --> 00:05:51,703
No, wait, I'm thinking of loons.

96
00:05:52,693 --> 00:05:55,048
That's a coincidence.

97
00:05:56,405 --> 00:05:58,839
Shoot, I got borscht on my sleeve.

98
00:05:59,116 --> 00:06:02,313
- Do you have any club soda?
- Right through here.

99
00:06:04,788 --> 00:06:08,144
Frasier, are you sure
you want to send in that Mouseketeer?

100
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:12,974
Why do you assume that to be an agent
you have to be an unscrupulous huckster?

101
00:06:13,338 --> 00:06:16,057
It is possible for a decent man
to be as intimidating

102
00:06:16,341 --> 00:06:18,332
as the toughest shark out there.

103
00:06:18,593 --> 00:06:20,982
Time to skedaddle.

104
00:06:21,263 --> 00:06:22,662
I have to pick up a friend.

105
00:06:22,889 --> 00:06:26,848
The poor guy just went bankrupt,
so he's bunking in our rumpus room.

106
00:06:27,185 --> 00:06:28,379
That's generous ofyou.

107
00:06:28,603 --> 00:06:31,481
Well, he's not just a friend.
He's a client.

108
00:06:39,197 --> 00:06:42,746
The press and the board members
will join us in here for a buffet.

109
00:06:43,076 --> 00:06:46,512
So I finish my speech and
then give Mr Twembly the cue,

110
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:49,549
and he brings out
this marvellous creature.

111
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:51,186
Just give me the signal.

112
00:06:51,418 --> 00:06:54,251
This is great.
Look at this. Turkey, chicken wings.

113
00:06:55,172 --> 00:06:57,208
Got to make you a little nervous, huh?

114
00:06:58,133 --> 00:07:02,046
Look, it's Toffee Macintosh
from the news. I just love her.

115
00:07:02,387 --> 00:07:05,504
- Frasier.
- Toffee, thank you for covering us.

116
00:07:05,807 --> 00:07:10,244
You know my motto. "lf it
happens in Seattle, it's news to me".

117
00:07:10,604 --> 00:07:14,119
I'd like you to meet one
of your biggest fans, Daphne Moon.

118
00:07:14,441 --> 00:07:18,400
I love the way you get all sombre
when you describe a flood or a murder.

119
00:07:18,737 --> 00:07:21,615
Then you cheer right up
the minute you're done.

120
00:07:22,783 --> 00:07:25,900
It makes me think,
"lf she can get over it, so can l".

121
00:07:26,203 --> 00:07:28,273
That's what I'm here for.

122
00:07:28,538 --> 00:07:30,768
- Ready to greet your public?
- Come on, Dad.

123
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:32,440
I'll be there in a sec.

124
00:07:32,668 --> 00:07:37,458
See what maternal instincts this
woman has. Even Bobo here can sense it.

125
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:40,831
I'm not the only one
getting some publicity today.

126
00:07:41,134 --> 00:07:44,922
- Frasier, they want to start.
- Ben, I'd like you to meet some people.

127
00:07:45,263 --> 00:07:48,539
This is Bebe and Roz.
This is Ben, my new agent.

128
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:49,839
- Hi.
- Hi, Ben.

129
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:55,692
Small world. Mr Twembly and I sang for
the same choir in Salt Lake City.

130
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:57,860
Nice meeting you, ladies.

131
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:03,025
Well, when there's a dirty job to be
done, you can't go wrong with a Mormon.

132
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:09,079
Scoff all you like.
The man is a genius of PR.

133
00:08:10,956 --> 00:08:14,551
Good afternoon.
On behalf ofthe Mercer lsland Zoo,

134
00:08:14,876 --> 00:08:19,427
I would like to welcome our
very special guest, Dr Frasier Crane.

135
00:08:22,968 --> 00:08:25,163
Thank you, Mr Twembly.

136
00:08:26,138 --> 00:08:29,210
It's appropriate
that the zoo has called upon me

137
00:08:29,516 --> 00:08:31,905
to introduce you all
to its newest resident.

138
00:08:32,185 --> 00:08:35,336
You see,
he happens to be a relative of mine.

139
00:08:38,567 --> 00:08:41,035
What're you looking at?
This is human food.

140
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,517
You don't see me
looking at your bird food, do you?

141
00:08:46,283 --> 00:08:49,116
What are you doing?
That's notvery nice.

142
00:08:49,411 --> 00:08:52,448
Wait. No. Where are you going?

143
00:08:53,248 --> 00:08:56,206
We're both tall
and have distinctive profiles.

144
00:08:56,501 --> 00:08:59,254
We've both been known
to winter in Mexico.

145
00:09:00,297 --> 00:09:02,857
And let's not forget our voices.

146
00:09:03,133 --> 00:09:07,365
Is there anything as stirring
as the crane's majestic cry?

147
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:12,275
- Get it off me!
- Dad, are you all right?

148
00:09:12,601 --> 00:09:15,877
My goodness, what is going on?

149
00:09:16,188 --> 00:09:18,748
I'm sorry. Nothing to be alarmed about.

150
00:09:19,024 --> 00:09:21,982
Just a little family squabble.

151
00:09:26,073 --> 00:09:28,268
In a shocking and gruesome incident,

152
00:09:28,533 --> 00:09:32,208
the Mercer Island Zoo seemed
more like the Island of Doctor Moreau,

153
00:09:32,537 --> 00:09:35,813
as a disabled senior citizen
was savagely attacked

154
00:09:36,124 --> 00:09:38,957
by Frasier Crane, bird of prey.

155
00:09:39,252 --> 00:09:41,891
- I can't watch this.
- I can't hear any of it.

156
00:09:42,172 --> 00:09:45,642
You weren't hurt badly. You
wouldn't know that to listen to Toffee.

157
00:09:45,968 --> 00:09:51,565
- She makes it sound like a disaster.
- But she could smile right after.

158
00:09:56,687 --> 00:09:59,440
This affair
has turned into a PR nightmare.

159
00:09:59,731 --> 00:10:03,440
It's your own fault for hiring
Howdy Doody as your agent.

160
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:08,476
Ben had no idea
that bird was going to attack you.

161
00:10:08,782 --> 00:10:12,695
Besides, there's no such thing
as bad publicity.

162
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:23,494
The radio are offering a cash prize
for the best Frasier Crane joke.

163
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:28,396
What was the front-runner? How can you
tell Frasier the crane's a psychiatrist?

164
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,829
I can't wait to hear.

165
00:10:30,053 --> 00:10:33,250
He ignores what you say,
then sticks you with a large bill.

166
00:10:37,811 --> 00:10:42,248
Forgive my jolly mood but Maris was
over for our weekly conjugal visit.

167
00:10:45,152 --> 00:10:49,543
She looked so seductive. She
wore a clingy gown, crimson lipstick,

168
00:10:49,906 --> 00:10:54,184
even earrings, which she tends to avoid
as they make her head droop.

169
00:10:54,536 --> 00:10:58,688
She pulled me down upon the bed and
began playing my spine like a zither.

170
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:03,512
Then as things were heating up, she
requested again I dismiss DrWilfong.

171
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:07,235
So tremulous with desire was l
that I almost relented,

172
00:11:07,549 --> 00:11:11,940
but then I remembered your advice,
Frasier, and I said I wouldn't fire him.

173
00:11:12,304 --> 00:11:17,742
So Maris told me I wouldn't be firing
anything else in the foreseeable future.

174
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:19,895
And she left.

175
00:11:20,145 --> 00:11:23,615
Withholding sex
can be just as difficult on Maris.

176
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:28,889
Are you serious? One hour
of passion can sustain her for months.

177
00:11:29,821 --> 00:11:32,415
She stores it up like some sexual camel.

178
00:11:33,575 --> 00:11:36,612
All right, Niles,
you know that my advice was solid.

179
00:11:36,912 --> 00:11:38,311
I hope you're right.

180
00:11:39,331 --> 00:11:40,730
I'll get it.

181
00:11:41,917 --> 00:11:45,114
- Hello. Hello, Roz. It's Roz.
- Thank you.

182
00:11:46,171 --> 00:11:48,162
Roz, hello. Yes, what is it?

183
00:11:48,423 --> 00:11:51,256
- That's a striking arrangement.
- It's from Bebe.

184
00:11:51,551 --> 00:11:53,860
She's trying to woo him back.

185
00:11:54,137 --> 00:11:57,527
Birds of paradise. I suppose
that's her idea of floral irony.

186
00:12:00,978 --> 00:12:02,969
Thanks for the warning, Roz.

187
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:05,539
- Bye-bye.
- What's that about?

188
00:12:05,816 --> 00:12:10,446
The station manager won't be
renegotiating the contracts himself.

189
00:12:10,821 --> 00:12:15,497
Apparently he's brought in one of these
hired guns stations use to reduce costs.

190
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:20,600
- Some fellow nicknamed "The Hammer".
- "The Hammer" because he's tough?

191
00:12:20,956 --> 00:12:24,426
No, Niles, because he loves
the lyrics of Oscar Hammerstein.

192
00:12:26,169 --> 00:12:28,558
If I were you, I'd give Bebe a call.

193
00:12:28,839 --> 00:12:31,273
This is a pretty big negotiation.

194
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:34,223
No, Dad, I am sticking with Ben.

195
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:38,485
Maybe Bebe could use her dark arts
to get me a dollar ortwo more,

196
00:12:38,807 --> 00:12:41,082
but my integrity
is worth more than that.

197
00:12:41,351 --> 00:12:44,229
- Hey, big guy. How are you doing?
- I'm fine.

198
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,510
People are being mean about this.

199
00:12:48,775 --> 00:12:51,573
I was listening to the radio
on the way over. Ouch.

200
00:12:51,862 --> 00:12:54,854
I always say, "lf life
hands you a lemon, make lemonade".

201
00:12:55,157 --> 00:12:59,230
- So you've got a damage control plan?
- I got a way to turn this mess around

202
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:02,411
and show that station manager
what you're made of.

203
00:13:02,706 --> 00:13:06,665
Excellent. But you'll be dealing
with a freelancer they call the Hammer.

204
00:13:09,171 --> 00:13:13,164
- You've gone up against him?
- I had to take a firm line with him.

205
00:13:13,508 --> 00:13:16,580
I finally said,
"You just clean up your language, pal."

206
00:13:16,887 --> 00:13:20,436
"l walked out of that Mamet play,
I can walk out on you".

207
00:13:24,227 --> 00:13:28,982
- So, about your plan.
- I think there's a way to show people

208
00:13:29,358 --> 00:13:32,316
you're laughing with them.
You do a photo op where you,

209
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:35,921
Seattle's best-loved psychiatrist,
give the crane therapy.

210
00:13:36,239 --> 00:13:40,835
You sit in a chair with a pad on your
lap, and the crane, properly sedated,

211
00:13:41,203 --> 00:13:43,319
sits on...

212
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:44,569
this.

213
00:13:50,379 --> 00:13:53,735
- Where did you find a couch that size?
- I built it myself.

214
00:13:54,049 --> 00:13:58,042
I have a workshop in my attic where l
make toys for the neighbourhood kids.

215
00:13:59,012 --> 00:14:02,084
Look at you. Agent, Samaritan,

216
00:14:02,391 --> 00:14:04,302
elf.

217
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:08,029
Dad, I like this idea.
It's droll and self-mocking.

218
00:14:08,355 --> 00:14:11,745
It's a way to turn
a PR embarrassment into a triumph.

219
00:14:12,067 --> 00:14:15,537
Great. I'll set up the photo op.
Don't be nervous about the Hammer.

220
00:14:15,862 --> 00:14:18,057
I can be a tough customer myself.

221
00:14:18,323 --> 00:14:21,156
I know you're going to give him hell.

222
00:14:21,451 --> 00:14:25,126
I love show folk,
but I'll never get used to the cursing.

223
00:14:42,723 --> 00:14:44,202
Latte, please.

224
00:14:44,433 --> 00:14:46,822
Didn't I see your picture
in the paper today?

225
00:14:47,102 --> 00:14:50,333
There was a big bird
chasing you around a little couch.

226
00:14:55,777 --> 00:14:57,574
Latte, please.

227
00:15:00,949 --> 00:15:04,942
I thinkyou have a real case against
the maker ofthose crane sedatives.

228
00:15:08,498 --> 00:15:12,616
I just wish they'd named
the damned bird after somebody else.

229
00:15:12,961 --> 00:15:14,952
Gregory Peck, perhaps.

230
00:15:17,299 --> 00:15:19,290
Thank you for the sympathy.

231
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:24,784
You're not the only one having a rough
patch. My libido is at breaking point.

232
00:15:25,182 --> 00:15:27,776
- You can't give in.
- I am getting desperate.

233
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:30,449
This morning I flirted
with my manicurist.

234
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:34,165
- The one with the thing on her face?
- I told you, I'm desperate.

235
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:37,892
What can be keeping Ben?

236
00:15:38,153 --> 00:15:42,669
After all this, you're still using Ben?
Shouldn'tyou just go back to Bebe?

237
00:15:43,033 --> 00:15:46,992
You think if I bail on my principles, it
gives you an excuse to go back to Maris.

238
00:15:47,329 --> 00:15:51,242
Well, I won't do it. Ben may have made
some mistakes, but he is a good man.

239
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:53,414
He's going to make me a good deal.

240
00:15:53,669 --> 00:15:56,183
Gil. How did it go with the Hammer?

241
00:15:56,463 --> 00:16:02,413
You've never seen such cold, dead eyes.
It was like bargaining with Nosferatu.

242
00:16:04,221 --> 00:16:07,213
- My salary's been slashed.
- I'm sorry.

243
00:16:07,516 --> 00:16:11,111
- Anything else for you?
- Would you nibble this provocatively?

244
00:16:11,436 --> 00:16:12,755
Niles!

245
00:16:15,565 --> 00:16:17,157
We're fine, thank you.

246
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:21,102
I wish you good luck, Frasier.

247
00:16:21,363 --> 00:16:24,196
Nobody can squeeze blood
from that stone.

248
00:16:24,491 --> 00:16:26,482
Lattes for everyone.

249
00:16:26,785 --> 00:16:28,776
Don't tell me you did well?

250
00:16:29,037 --> 00:16:33,428
I got a weekly spot on Clint Webber's
show and a 30% raise.

251
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:37,580
- How did you get all that?
- We go way back, the Hammer and l.

252
00:16:37,921 --> 00:16:40,071
I know where the bodies are buried.

253
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:43,298
Usually that's just a metaphor.

254
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:48,739
So, Gil, what'll you have? My treat.

255
00:16:49,016 --> 00:16:52,804
I'll be happier at the losers' table
with Aunt Penny, the Story Lady.

256
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:55,181
Penny, don't put that flask away.

257
00:16:58,525 --> 00:17:01,244
Well, congratulations, Roz.

258
00:17:01,528 --> 00:17:05,203
I'm waiting for Ben. We have
to discuss our bargaining position.

259
00:17:05,532 --> 00:17:09,127
There are so many to choose from/
kneeling, crawling, grovelling.

260
00:17:09,453 --> 00:17:12,172
I'm sure he'll pick the right one.

261
00:17:12,748 --> 00:17:15,057
God, she is obnoxious.

262
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:18,132
Though alluring,
in a buxom-bad-girl kind ofway.

263
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:22,227
Shut up, you horny idiot.

264
00:17:26,011 --> 00:17:30,084
My bandage is loose. If Ben gets here,
just tell him I went in to fix it.

265
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:40,328
We have to talk.

266
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:42,842
Are you aware you are in the men's room?

267
00:17:43,111 --> 00:17:46,308
If I paid attention to signs
with pictures on them,

268
00:17:46,615 --> 00:17:48,970
I'd never get a parking space.

269
00:17:52,287 --> 00:17:56,075
It's time we dropped the masks.
You need me and I want you back.

270
00:17:56,416 --> 00:18:01,206
Sign this contract. I'll cut you a deal
to make Roz's look like lunch money.

271
00:18:01,588 --> 00:18:05,297
Isn't there a zebra carcass somewhere
you should be hovering over?

272
00:18:07,135 --> 00:18:10,047
You want to see a carcass?
Go look in the mirror.

273
00:18:10,347 --> 00:18:12,815
Look what you've let that man
do to you.

274
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:16,410
Your face is riddled with bird bites,
your name's a punchline

275
00:18:16,728 --> 00:18:19,003
and your career
is five minutes from over.

276
00:18:19,272 --> 00:18:22,548
And he's only been your agent
for three days.

277
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:28,134
Send him in against the Hammer
and you'll be doing fog reports

278
00:18:28,448 --> 00:18:30,678
from a lighthouse in Puget Sound.

279
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:36,108
- Admit it, you're scared.
- All right, maybe I am scared.

280
00:18:36,456 --> 00:18:40,847
But there's one thing
that's stronger than fear. Faith.

281
00:18:41,211 --> 00:18:44,362
Faith that a good man with a good heart
can make a good deal.

282
00:18:44,673 --> 00:18:47,585
- Now get out of my way.
- No, I won't let you.

283
00:18:47,884 --> 00:18:51,081
You know what I've been through
building your career?

284
00:18:51,388 --> 00:18:55,745
I have been to hell and back
so often I have frequent flyer miles.

285
00:18:57,894 --> 00:19:00,089
You owe me a second chance.

286
00:19:00,355 --> 00:19:03,267
Take your tentacles off of me.

287
00:19:04,943 --> 00:19:08,458
Please. I won't be the same Bebe
you knew. I'll change.

288
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,294
I'll be like Ben...

289
00:19:11,575 --> 00:19:13,566
only competent.

290
00:19:15,329 --> 00:19:18,560
Darling, you forgot to sign.

291
00:19:18,874 --> 00:19:21,263
You've reconciled.
I'll be off to Maris's.

292
00:19:21,543 --> 00:19:23,659
Sit down, Niles.

293
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,115
I'm still with Ben.

294
00:19:26,381 --> 00:19:29,896
I took my son's troop on a nature hike
and Noah got a bee sting.

295
00:19:30,218 --> 00:19:32,573
I rushed him to the ER
and came straight here.

296
00:19:32,846 --> 00:19:35,485
- We've got five minutes.
- Excuse me.

297
00:19:35,766 --> 00:19:37,996
Bebe can make you a better deal.

298
00:19:38,268 --> 00:19:40,384
- Listen to Roz.
- Listen to Niles.

299
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:42,637
I won't listen to any of you.

300
00:19:42,898 --> 00:19:46,447
Am I the last man still willing
to stand up for a principle?

301
00:19:46,777 --> 00:19:49,416
Shall we go over those demands
for old Mr Hammer?

302
00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:58,550
Ben, could we have a word?

303
00:19:59,873 --> 00:20:01,864
Hello, Maris?

304
00:20:09,257 --> 00:20:13,694
I don't think it's news to you that
things haven't been going so smoothly.

305
00:20:15,222 --> 00:20:18,578
I think I'd feel more comfortable
with Bebe.

306
00:20:18,892 --> 00:20:21,360
This must seem
a bit of a shock to you, but...

307
00:20:21,645 --> 00:20:25,638
Heck, no. I saw this coming.
When you threw that couch at me,

308
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:28,702
I thought to myself,
"This is not a happy client".

309
00:20:31,321 --> 00:20:33,312
Thanks for understanding.

310
00:20:35,492 --> 00:20:37,130
Taxi!

311
00:20:40,914 --> 00:20:43,030
Sign right here, darling.

312
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:46,803
I'm holding you
to that promise about changing.

313
00:20:47,087 --> 00:20:50,602
- I won't stand for any shady doings.
- Those days are all behind me.

314
00:20:50,924 --> 00:20:55,076
Maybe you can see what you can do about
diffusing this bird situation.

315
00:20:55,429 --> 00:20:57,659
You don't have to worry
about the crane.

316
00:20:57,931 --> 00:21:00,161
It choked to death this morning.

317
00:21:00,434 --> 00:21:03,710
They have no idea
who would feed a bird a jawbreaker.

318
00:21:04,021 --> 00:21:05,249
Bye now.

319
00:21:19,661 --> 00:21:22,937
Bebe, is there any chance it wasn't you?

320
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:26,380
Darling,

321
00:21:29,296 --> 00:21:31,685
there's always a chance.

322
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:35,954
I can live with that.
