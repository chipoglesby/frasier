1
00:00:09,975 --> 00:00:13,524
-Morning, Roz.
- Niles called. He'll be over at seven.

2
00:00:13,854 --> 00:00:17,813
- Thanks. You seem awfully calm today.
- Why shouldn't I be?

3
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:20,618
You're usually anxious in ratings week.

4
00:00:20,902 --> 00:00:23,780
- That starts today?
- I shouldn't have mentioned it.

5
00:00:24,072 --> 00:00:27,826
You do this every year. You convince
yourselfwe'll have no good callers,

6
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,913
but our listeners always come through.

7
00:00:31,204 --> 00:00:33,195
You're on.

8
00:00:34,291 --> 00:00:36,600
Hello, Seattle.
This is Dr Frasier Crane.

9
00:00:36,877 --> 00:00:39,550
I was reminded this morning
of a jaunty aphorism

10
00:00:39,838 --> 00:00:42,636
that's credited
to the great thinker Spinoza.

11
00:00:42,924 --> 00:00:43,913
Oh, God!

12
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:50,334
- What's your problem?
- Hi. Well, I'm kind ofindecisive.

13
00:00:50,724 --> 00:00:53,716
Well, I'm not. Frasier Crane Show.

14
00:00:54,019 --> 00:00:56,931
I want to change careers.
I feel trapped.

15
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:59,585
It's not a great problem,
but hold, please.

16
00:00:59,858 --> 00:01:02,213
Frasier Crane Show.
what's your problem?

17
00:01:02,486 --> 00:01:05,000
- It's sort of embarrassing.
- Amen.

18
00:01:06,323 --> 00:01:10,441
I was a bed-wetter as a child and
I think the problem's coming back.

19
00:01:10,786 --> 00:01:14,335
Great. Hold, please. Career change?
I got a bed-wetter holding.

20
00:01:14,665 --> 00:01:18,499
Are you trapped because you're
a woman trapped inside a man's body?

21
00:01:18,835 --> 00:01:21,713
- I don't think so.
- I can't get you on then.

22
00:01:22,005 --> 00:01:25,600
I really wanted to talk to him.
I guess that could be part ofit.

23
00:01:25,926 --> 00:01:27,484
Good answer. Hold, please.

24
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:31,075
Bed-wetter, I got a transsexual
in crisis. You've got to beat that.

25
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:34,746
Ever wet a bed with anybody else in it?
A hooker, best friend's wife?

26
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:36,049
No.

27
00:01:36,269 --> 00:01:40,182
- Do you want to talk to the doc or not?
- OK. I guess the third one.

28
00:01:40,524 --> 00:01:43,436
Hold, please.
Hey, transsexual.

29
00:01:43,735 --> 00:01:46,647
- Is that me?
- Yeah.

30
00:01:46,947 --> 00:01:50,064
Have you ever run for political office
or considered it?

31
00:01:50,367 --> 00:01:53,643
- Like congressman?
- Perfect.

32
00:01:53,954 --> 00:01:58,232
Don't get me started on rationalistic
pantheism or there go the three hours.

33
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:03,988
I think it's time we went to the phones.
Roz, whom do we have?

34
00:02:04,339 --> 00:02:08,332
A bed-wetting adulterer, unless you'd
rather speak to Roger on line two

35
00:02:08,677 --> 00:02:11,908
who's a transsexual
running for Congress.

36
00:02:13,974 --> 00:02:16,647
Go ahead, Roger, I'm listening.

37
00:02:22,983 --> 00:02:25,656
Why did you chicken out like that?

38
00:02:25,944 --> 00:02:29,573
She's younger than I am.
She probably dates doctors and lawyers.

39
00:02:29,906 --> 00:02:34,457
- She wouldn't be interested in me.
- Who wouldn't be interested?

40
00:02:34,828 --> 00:02:38,298
A certain someone had the chance
to ask a certain someone else

41
00:02:38,623 --> 00:02:41,740
- from the building on a date.
- That would be Mrs Crowley.

42
00:02:44,046 --> 00:02:46,037
And bailed out again.

43
00:02:46,298 --> 00:02:50,450
The Crane men have not enjoyed success
in the romance department lately.

44
00:02:50,802 --> 00:02:53,157
We're all a bit gun-shy.

45
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:57,025
Gun-shy, sensitive, picky.
You're all full of excuses.

46
00:02:57,351 --> 00:03:01,663
Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever get
you married off and out ofthis house.

47
00:03:04,399 --> 00:03:09,189
Hello? Why, Mrs Crowley,
we were just talking about you.

48
00:03:09,571 --> 00:03:11,562
Yes, he's here. Hold on.

49
00:03:19,081 --> 00:03:20,196
Hi.

50
00:03:20,415 --> 00:03:24,931
Really? No, I'm not busy.
Dinner sounds like fun.

51
00:03:25,295 --> 00:03:30,085
A certain someone is inviting
a certain someone else to dinner.

52
00:03:30,467 --> 00:03:32,458
Yes, and where would the world be

53
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:35,995
without you Brits
and your knack for code-cracking?

54
00:03:38,558 --> 00:03:44,190
Sure, I'd love to. Thanks.
And thanks for asking me. Bye.

55
00:03:44,606 --> 00:03:47,564
She's invited me
to her place tomorrow night.

56
00:03:47,859 --> 00:03:51,135
Guess my little hard-to-get plan
really paid off.

57
00:03:51,446 --> 00:03:56,201
Yes, you should write a book.
"How to Get a Date in Two Easy Years".

58
00:03:58,453 --> 00:04:01,650
- Hello, Niles.
- Frasier. Dad. Hey, Daphne.

59
00:04:01,957 --> 00:04:03,993
- What have got there?
- Patient files.

60
00:04:04,251 --> 00:04:06,719
Frasier's helping me
with my couples' group.

61
00:04:07,004 --> 00:04:09,837
Your father's starting
a couples' group tomorrow.

62
00:04:10,132 --> 00:04:11,690
Mrs Crowley?

63
00:04:13,802 --> 00:04:17,681
It's ironic. Dad's doing better
in that department than either of of us.

64
00:04:18,015 --> 00:04:20,324
Not true.
That's what I wanted to tell you.

65
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,239
Maris and l
are back on the expressway to love.

66
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,671
Well, if not the expressway,
at least the on-ramp.

67
00:04:28,317 --> 00:04:31,275
I owe it all to the best psychiatrist
I have ever known.

68
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:34,528
- That's very flattering.
- Dr Bernard Schenkman,

69
00:04:34,823 --> 00:04:37,178
our new marriage counsellor.
He's a wizard.

70
00:04:37,451 --> 00:04:41,239
Maris is thrilled with him. It's
as if he's discovered the magic elixir

71
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:44,458
to repair the shattered fragments
of her psyche.

72
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:48,709
- I don't know what to call it.
- The words "crazy glue" leap to mind.

73
00:04:51,465 --> 00:04:55,902
Doctor Schenkman's helped me, too.
He pinpointed my primary failing.

74
00:04:56,261 --> 00:04:58,729
- Which is?
- I'm too predictable.

75
00:04:59,014 --> 00:05:01,403
I don't know
if I'd count that as a failing.

76
00:05:01,683 --> 00:05:05,039
I do and so does Maris.
But I'm going to do something about it.

77
00:05:05,354 --> 00:05:08,869
In half an hour I'll show Maris
spontaneity beyond her dreams.

78
00:05:09,191 --> 00:05:11,386
But we're preparing for your workshop.

79
00:05:11,652 --> 00:05:14,120
You'll have to
look over the files yourself.

80
00:05:14,404 --> 00:05:17,123
Every Friday
Maris spends an hour meditating.

81
00:05:17,407 --> 00:05:20,717
Invariably
she comes back randy as a stoat.

82
00:05:21,953 --> 00:05:25,707
Tonight she'll find me
waiting in her bed as randy as

83
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,730
another stoat.

84
00:05:32,547 --> 00:05:35,107
I wonder ifthat's a good idea.

85
00:05:35,384 --> 00:05:38,740
Frasier, I know you mean well
and I love you and respect you,

86
00:05:39,054 --> 00:05:41,693
but with your track record
in relationships,

87
00:05:41,974 --> 00:05:45,091
you're about the last person
who should be giving advice.

88
00:05:45,394 --> 00:05:46,793
Fair enough.

89
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:50,854
And do look over the files.
Those couples really need our help.

90
00:07:00,344 --> 00:07:02,300
Hello, Maris.

91
00:08:35,147 --> 00:08:36,136
Maris?

92
00:08:43,405 --> 00:08:45,123
- Dr Schenkman.
- Niles.

93
00:08:45,365 --> 00:08:47,560
Dr Schenkman, what the hell's going on?

94
00:08:47,826 --> 00:08:50,898
It's not what it looks like.

95
00:08:51,204 --> 00:08:54,674
What am I saying? Bear with me.

96
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,630
- I'm sorry. I'm feeling stressed.
- You're feeling stressed?

97
00:09:00,005 --> 00:09:03,998
- Put yourself in my place.
- I very nearly did.

98
00:09:06,595 --> 00:09:09,667
I'm stunned.
How long has this been going on?

99
00:09:09,973 --> 00:09:11,167
Two weeks.

100
00:09:11,391 --> 00:09:15,828
Maris and I were waiting to tell you
when I felt that you were ready.

101
00:09:16,188 --> 00:09:21,501
That's despicable. It's unethical.
It's... Are those my pyjamas?

102
00:09:21,902 --> 00:09:25,372
Could be.
They bind a little in the crotch.

103
00:09:25,697 --> 00:09:29,133
Listen, whatever anger you're feeling

104
00:09:29,451 --> 00:09:33,444
- can't begin to approach my guilt.
- Don't bet on it.

105
00:09:33,789 --> 00:09:36,986
That's good. Vent that rage.
You have every right to.

106
00:09:37,292 --> 00:09:40,841
You're sleeping with my wife and
giving me permission to be angry?

107
00:09:41,171 --> 00:09:42,843
Furious. Livid.

108
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:45,399
You're dealing with itverywell,
bythe way.

109
00:09:45,676 --> 00:09:48,668
- Would you care...?
- You could lose your licence

110
00:09:48,971 --> 00:09:52,407
- for having an affair with a patient?
- And I deserve to,

111
00:09:52,724 --> 00:09:55,477
but it was a risk
worth taking because of love.

112
00:10:01,108 --> 00:10:03,178
I love her, Niles.

113
00:10:03,443 --> 00:10:06,640
I've never known a woman so warm,

114
00:10:06,947 --> 00:10:09,859
so nurturing, so unselfish.

115
00:10:14,663 --> 00:10:18,702
Is it possible this is
a case of mistaken identity?

116
00:10:19,042 --> 00:10:21,033
Thanks to our sessions,

117
00:10:21,294 --> 00:10:25,333
Maris has been unafraid to show me
the real woman inside.

118
00:10:25,674 --> 00:10:29,269
Damn you. I trusted you. Because
you were supposed to be helping us.

119
00:10:29,594 --> 00:10:31,903
And I liked you, too, you bastard.

120
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:36,253
You betrayed my confidence and my
friendship and you seduced my wife.

121
00:10:36,601 --> 00:10:40,560
There's a lot of new issues here,
aren't there?

122
00:10:41,356 --> 00:10:44,871
Think maybe we should kick it
up to three sessions a week?

123
00:10:50,532 --> 00:10:52,568
- You are 20 minutes late.
- Sorry.

124
00:10:52,826 --> 00:10:57,775
Sorry? I've been making small talk
with them for 20 minutes.

125
00:10:58,165 --> 00:11:02,636
And for people who have a problem
communicating that's tiny talk.

126
00:11:03,962 --> 00:11:05,953
I have a lot on my mind right now

127
00:11:06,214 --> 00:11:10,651
so let's just begin and, you know what,
maybe you should take the lead. OK?

128
00:11:11,011 --> 00:11:13,161
Very well.

129
00:11:14,181 --> 00:11:17,253
Evening, all. Sorry I'm late. My fault.

130
00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:20,392
If I know these people,
they won't hold a grudge.

131
00:11:20,687 --> 00:11:23,997
I feel as though I do know
a great deal about this group.

132
00:11:24,316 --> 00:11:28,787
I've spent a good deal oftime
pouring over your case histories.

133
00:11:30,197 --> 00:11:32,711
So, let's begin.

134
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:36,461
Mrs Buddinger,
I see that you're here alone.

135
00:11:36,787 --> 00:11:39,540
- Yes.
- Is there a reason Dan's not here?

136
00:11:39,831 --> 00:11:45,349
No, he's just stubborn sometimes.
He says he doesn't trust psychiatrists.

137
00:11:54,429 --> 00:11:57,705
- Maybe he's got good reason not to.
- Excuse me?

138
00:11:58,016 --> 00:12:01,452
I see what your brother's doing here.
Sometimes we role play

139
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:04,967
and I think he's just saying
what my husband might say.

140
00:12:05,273 --> 00:12:07,787
Sounds promising, Janice.

141
00:12:08,068 --> 00:12:11,344
Howwould you respond
to whatyour husband has just said?

142
00:12:14,616 --> 00:12:18,973
You know, Dan, I don't think that
it's psychiatrists thatyou mistrust.

143
00:12:19,329 --> 00:12:23,720
I think it's me.
Why are you so suspicious lately?

144
00:12:24,084 --> 00:12:26,075
I thinkyou knowverywell.

145
00:12:32,926 --> 00:12:36,157
A couple of harmless flirtations
at parties?

146
00:12:36,471 --> 00:12:40,623
Did you ever stop to consider how
those flirtations might make me feel?

147
00:12:40,976 --> 00:12:44,366
He's empathising with the husband.
We call this empathising.

148
00:12:44,688 --> 00:12:48,476
Are you going to tell me
you've never looked at anyone else?

149
00:12:48,817 --> 00:12:51,490
Don't you dare bring her into this.

150
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,999
She is clean and pure and decent.

151
00:12:56,283 --> 00:12:59,958
Sometimes empathising
involves a bit of dramatic licence.

152
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:04,519
- At least I've always been faithful.
- I've always been faithful to you.

153
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:08,948
I wanted to believe that more
than anything in the world but now...

154
00:13:11,256 --> 00:13:14,328
I don't see how I possibly can.

155
00:13:14,635 --> 00:13:17,866
He's one of the greatest empathisers
in the business.

156
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:21,411
Now I just want to die!

157
00:13:24,978 --> 00:13:29,369
Perhaps now would be a good time
to take our 15-minute break.

158
00:13:29,733 --> 00:13:31,724
We've made quite a catharsis here.

159
00:13:31,985 --> 00:13:35,295
Traditionally it is the patients
who make the breakthroughs,

160
00:13:35,614 --> 00:13:37,605
but we mustn't be sticklers.

161
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:39,724
All right, Janice.

162
00:13:39,951 --> 00:13:43,785
Dan and I have never cheated
on each other. You've got to believe me.

163
00:13:44,122 --> 00:13:48,912
I do. Remember, no one is here
to judge anyone else's behaviour.

164
00:13:49,294 --> 00:13:51,967
What the hell are you doing,
you lunatic?

165
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:54,610
Maris is having an affair
with Schenkman.

166
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,749
Schenkman?

167
00:13:59,638 --> 00:14:01,708
Whythe contemptible bastard.

168
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:04,886
He was waiting at the house
for herwhen I got there.

169
00:14:05,185 --> 00:14:09,258
I'm so sorry, Niles.
Is there anything I can do?

170
00:14:09,606 --> 00:14:12,882
I don't see how. They're in love.
They plan to get married.

171
00:14:13,193 --> 00:14:15,149
He told you that?

172
00:14:15,404 --> 00:14:18,237
And she confirmed it...
when she walked in,

173
00:14:18,532 --> 00:14:22,411
once she'd stopped shrieking
and we'd coaxed her down off the canopy.

174
00:14:24,746 --> 00:14:30,025
I'm just shocked. Things seemed to be
going so well with the two ofyou.

175
00:14:30,419 --> 00:14:32,410
That's what I thought.

176
00:14:37,718 --> 00:14:41,188
Maybe Maris' feelings
for Dr Schenkman aren't real.

177
00:14:41,513 --> 00:14:44,311
Maybe this is
simply a case oftransference.

178
00:14:44,599 --> 00:14:47,830
Patients often believe
they're in love with their analysts.

179
00:14:48,145 --> 00:14:50,579
- It's very common.
- It's happened to me.

180
00:14:50,856 --> 00:14:52,972
Get out of town.

181
00:14:53,233 --> 00:14:58,512
- I bet that's what's going on here.
- They've never fallen in love with me.

182
00:14:58,905 --> 00:15:01,100
Maris is easily influenced.

183
00:15:01,366 --> 00:15:04,005
Not even that fat lady
who brought me fudge.

184
00:15:04,286 --> 00:15:06,516
I'd be a fool to let her go.

185
00:15:06,788 --> 00:15:09,348
Niles, you're just grasping at straws.

186
00:15:09,624 --> 00:15:12,297
I owe it to my marriage
to give it one more shot.

187
00:15:12,586 --> 00:15:15,703
- How? What more could you do?
- I can talk to her alone.

188
00:15:16,006 --> 00:15:18,725
Make her understand
what a mistake she's making.

189
00:15:19,009 --> 00:15:22,763
Let's bear one thing in mind. Sometimes
a marriage is just bad, doomed,

190
00:15:23,096 --> 00:15:26,008
and no amount of discussion
will save it.

191
00:15:30,479 --> 00:15:32,947
Well, then, shall we resume?

192
00:15:38,153 --> 00:15:43,785
No, Daphne, you have fun. I'll be fine.
Yeah. We'll see you tomorrow. OK.

193
00:15:44,201 --> 00:15:47,079
Dad? No, he's not even back
from his big date yet.

194
00:15:47,371 --> 00:15:49,931
Maybe I'll see him in the morning, too.

195
00:15:50,207 --> 00:15:51,196
All right.

196
00:15:53,502 --> 00:15:57,336
Yes, it is a very romantic story.
Yes, yes.

197
00:15:57,673 --> 00:15:59,709
OK, Daphne.

198
00:15:59,967 --> 00:16:02,720
Yes, they do make a very cute couple.

199
00:16:03,011 --> 00:16:04,126
Anyway...

200
00:16:05,681 --> 00:16:08,400
Right, Daphne, yes.

201
00:16:08,684 --> 00:16:11,198
I suppose
they do owe it all to you, don't they?

202
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:14,174
There's the door. OK.

203
00:16:19,528 --> 00:16:22,520
Niles. I thought
you were talking with Maris.

204
00:16:22,823 --> 00:16:25,735
It's over. Let her marry Schenkman.

205
00:16:26,034 --> 00:16:28,025
They deserve each other.

206
00:16:28,286 --> 00:16:31,358
I'm sorry, Niles. What happened?

207
00:16:32,582 --> 00:16:36,052
I reached the front gate
and was just about to ring the doorbell

208
00:16:36,378 --> 00:16:39,654
to ask her to let me in
when it suddenly dawned on me

209
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:43,924
how many hours I have spent
pleading with that woman through gates,

210
00:16:44,261 --> 00:16:47,333
through windows, through keyholes
and through transoms

211
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:50,995
and, in one disastrous instance,
through the pet door.

212
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:56,546
Yes, I remember dabbing Bactine
on those Chihuahua bites.

213
00:16:57,733 --> 00:17:00,122
Well, I decided no more.

214
00:17:00,402 --> 00:17:04,281
I actually looked up at the house
and said, "Goodbye, Maris."

215
00:17:06,283 --> 00:17:08,319
"l hope you have a happy life,

216
00:17:08,577 --> 00:17:11,296
but I don't have
to take any more of your crap".

217
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:14,572
And I turned on my heel and walked away.

218
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:18,185
That's a courageous decision.

219
00:17:18,503 --> 00:17:21,859
- How do you feel?
- Not bad, surprisingly.

220
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:24,608
I'm glad I went over.
I needed the closure.

221
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:31,411
Now that it's over, I feel a little sad,
of course, but also strangely liberated.

222
00:17:34,269 --> 00:17:36,260
I'm very proud ofyou.

223
00:17:41,777 --> 00:17:44,291
Dad, you're back.

224
00:17:44,571 --> 00:17:47,131
How did things go with Mrs Crowley?

225
00:17:47,407 --> 00:17:52,686
Great. Fabulous. Right up to the time
she introduced me to my date.

226
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:56,523
- I thought she was your date.
- So did l.

227
00:17:56,792 --> 00:18:00,262
Turns out my date was her mother.

228
00:18:00,587 --> 00:18:05,900
86 years young. I guess there was
a miscommunication when she invited me.

229
00:18:06,301 --> 00:18:10,214
I'm almost afraid to ask this.
How was "Mom"?

230
00:18:12,641 --> 00:18:14,632
She was very nice.

231
00:18:14,893 --> 00:18:16,963
Sleepy.

232
00:18:18,605 --> 00:18:21,915
Showed me pictures
of her great-grandchildren.

233
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:26,910
Couldn't remember any of their names.
She couldn't remember mine either.

234
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,158
We could all use
a little something from the bar.

235
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:32,645
I could use a big something.

236
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:38,861
- It hasn't been a good day all around.
- Maris and I have split up for good.

237
00:18:39,293 --> 00:18:41,204
I'm sorry.

238
00:18:41,461 --> 00:18:45,090
- She's in love with someone else.
- Niles, are you all right?

239
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:46,777
I will be.

240
00:18:47,009 --> 00:18:50,843
Well, this may come
as small consolation to you,

241
00:18:51,179 --> 00:18:56,378
but I believe that
you each have a lot ofwork to do

242
00:18:56,768 --> 00:19:00,204
to catch up to me
in the failed romance department.

243
00:19:00,522 --> 00:19:02,513
Divorced twice,

244
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,095
Ieft at the altar once.

245
00:19:13,702 --> 00:19:18,059
Well, I haven't exactly
been burning things up lately.

246
00:19:18,415 --> 00:19:19,768
Thank you, Dad.

247
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,039
Things with Sherry fizzled,
then Sleeping Beauty tonight.

248
00:19:26,548 --> 00:19:29,142
I think maybe I deserve the booby prize.

249
00:19:33,013 --> 00:19:35,004
I'll challenge you.

250
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:39,672
Fifteen years with Maris,
I end up in bed with her lover.

251
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:48,999
I didn't need to hear that.

252
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:53,352
No, it was an accident. It was
pitch dark. I thought he was Maris.

253
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:57,534
It's a natural mistake.
What tipped you off?

254
00:19:57,871 --> 00:20:01,546
The heat from her side of the bed.

255
00:20:06,797 --> 00:20:10,506
Well, I think we have a three-way tie.

256
00:20:11,218 --> 00:20:14,767
Here's to the Crane boys,
love's big losers.

257
00:20:19,726 --> 00:20:24,561
I said I needed closure. I won't
have it until I do one more thing.

258
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:27,818
Niles, from this height
that can hurt somebody.

259
00:20:28,944 --> 00:20:30,502
All clear.

260
00:20:31,905 --> 00:20:35,295
Goodbye, Maris.
You've hurt me for the last time.

261
00:20:35,617 --> 00:20:39,246
Niles, is that your Mercedes
parked down there?

262
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:45,839
Good body shop
will be able to pound that out.

263
00:20:50,841 --> 00:20:52,957
Well, it's Saturday night.

264
00:20:54,261 --> 00:20:57,810
Here we are. Again.

265
00:20:58,765 --> 00:21:02,360
Wonder how many women are out there
tonight without a date.

266
00:21:02,686 --> 00:21:03,801
Thousands.

267
00:21:04,021 --> 00:21:08,378
Thousands of opportunities for us
to humiliate ourselves.

268
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:13,489
Well, come and get us, Seattle.
Three Cranes, no waiting.

269
00:21:13,864 --> 00:21:15,855
We're desperate.

270
00:21:16,116 --> 00:21:18,835
- We're ludicrous.
- We're pathetic.
