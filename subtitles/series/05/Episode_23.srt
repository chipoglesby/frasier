1
00:00:09,224 --> 00:00:11,215
-Morning, Roz.
- Hey, Frasier.

2
00:00:11,476 --> 00:00:13,831
Foryou. A little token ofthanks.

3
00:00:14,104 --> 00:00:17,335
Afteryou cutthose new promos,
Dr Frank on KTLK

4
00:00:17,649 --> 00:00:20,243
practically vanished from the radio.

5
00:00:20,527 --> 00:00:22,518
I'm not good at picking out gifts,

6
00:00:22,779 --> 00:00:26,089
butwhen I sawthis in the window
I knew itwas perfect foryou.

7
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:31,758
Maybe I should've gone with the shawl.

8
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:34,792
It's not the purse.
Although I do hate it.

9
00:00:37,044 --> 00:00:40,320
I don't even know why I'm crying.

10
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:44,543
It's the pregnancy. A soup of hormones
churns through your body

11
00:00:44,885 --> 00:00:47,274
and your emotions are rising and falling

12
00:00:47,554 --> 00:00:50,671
- at the slightest provocation.
- That's idiotic.

13
00:00:50,974 --> 00:00:55,684
- All right. Is something else going on?
- Last night was a disaster.

14
00:00:56,063 --> 00:00:59,180
- Right, your date.
- Everything was fine

15
00:00:59,483 --> 00:01:02,998
and when he tried to order me a drink
I told him I was pregnant.

16
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,311
You didn't tell him before the date?

17
00:01:05,572 --> 00:01:08,086
It's not the easiest thing
to tell someone.

18
00:01:08,367 --> 00:01:13,157
I was hoping my radiant glow
would do the talking for me.

19
00:01:13,538 --> 00:01:16,689
Your glow?
Roz, do you really think that

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,151
anyone could miss your glow?

21
00:01:21,088 --> 00:01:24,842
So, I tell him, and he says fine,
it's not a problem.

22
00:01:25,175 --> 00:01:27,735
Five minutes later
his pager is vibrating.

23
00:01:28,011 --> 00:01:30,400
He has an emergency.
He has to go to work.

24
00:01:30,681 --> 00:01:34,196
- Maybe he was telling the truth.
- He sells wicker furniture.

25
00:01:34,518 --> 00:01:38,716
Who needs their end tables re-caned
at 9.30 at night?

26
00:01:44,903 --> 00:01:47,781
I owe you an apology, Roz,
it's not the hormones.

27
00:01:48,073 --> 00:01:50,587
You're embarking
on a life-changing journey.

28
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:53,059
Anybody would be emotional.

29
00:01:53,328 --> 00:01:56,525
I think you're handling it beautifully.

30
00:01:57,207 --> 00:01:58,401
Thanks, Frasier.

31
00:02:00,502 --> 00:02:02,811
I'm fine.
I just need to go back to work.

32
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,865
My pen is out of ink.

33
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,110
Let's not discount the hormones
altogether.

34
00:02:17,269 --> 00:02:20,864
Hello, I'd like to return this purse.

35
00:02:21,189 --> 00:02:25,979
I'm terribly sorry but this was a sale
item and we have a no-return policy.

36
00:02:26,361 --> 00:02:29,114
- Your wife didn't like it?
- I'm not married.

37
00:02:29,406 --> 00:02:31,397
- Girlfriend?
- No. No girlfriend.

38
00:02:31,658 --> 00:02:35,287
I don't have time to go into
my other non-existent relationships.

39
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,611
It was a gift for a friend.

40
00:02:37,873 --> 00:02:42,628
Perhaps your "friend" would like to
make it work with some matching shoes.

41
00:02:43,003 --> 00:02:47,235
- We have up to size 13.
- This really was a gift,

42
00:02:47,591 --> 00:02:51,823
and I would thank you when you say
the word "friend" not to italicise it.

43
00:02:53,263 --> 00:02:56,175
Excuse me, sir,
I couldn't help overhearing.

44
00:02:56,475 --> 00:03:00,184
- May I help you out here?
- You hold her down, I can do the rest.

45
00:03:01,688 --> 00:03:04,122
Hopefully, that won't be necessary.

46
00:03:07,986 --> 00:03:10,022
Jill, we're all reasonable people.

47
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,238
Why don't you just
give this gentleman a store credit?

48
00:03:13,533 --> 00:03:15,728
I don't make the rules.

49
00:03:15,994 --> 00:03:19,145
But a shrewd saleswoman such as yourself

50
00:03:19,456 --> 00:03:23,847
knows that this business isn't about
rules. It's about relationships.

51
00:03:24,211 --> 00:03:27,203
Look at this man.
Cultured, impeccably dressed.

52
00:03:27,506 --> 00:03:30,578
The sort of man
you'd love to have a relationship with.

53
00:03:30,884 --> 00:03:34,718
There's one thing standing
in the way ofthat relationship.

54
00:03:35,055 --> 00:03:38,252
- He's not happywith his purse.
- It's not my purse.

55
00:03:38,558 --> 00:03:42,517
Maybe his purse was the wrong colour.
Maybe it didn't hold enough.

56
00:03:42,854 --> 00:03:45,573
It's not my purse.

57
00:03:45,857 --> 00:03:49,133
If he walks away unhappy,
he may never shop here again.

58
00:03:49,444 --> 00:03:52,242
And who knows what he might have
bought in the future?

59
00:03:52,531 --> 00:03:56,968
Scarves, gloves, hosiery.
The choice is yours, Jill.

60
00:03:57,327 --> 00:04:00,763
The commissions that come
from a lifelong relationship,

61
00:04:01,081 --> 00:04:05,871
orthe hollow satisfaction
of knowing you followed the rules?

62
00:04:07,337 --> 00:04:09,976
OK, I'll go get the forms.

63
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:15,729
Thank you. That was very impressive.

64
00:04:16,013 --> 00:04:20,564
You should see me return
something hard like a house or a kidney.

65
00:04:20,934 --> 00:04:22,925
The secret is persistence.

66
00:04:23,186 --> 00:04:26,417
- I'm Frasier Crane.
- Samantha Pierce. Sam.

67
00:04:26,732 --> 00:04:29,041
- Are you Dr Frasier Crane?
- Yes, I am.

68
00:04:29,318 --> 00:04:33,027
I thought your voice sounded familiar.
For a while, I thought you were

69
00:04:33,363 --> 00:04:36,480
the "white zone is for loading
and unloading only" guy.

70
00:04:36,783 --> 00:04:38,933
I get that a lot.

71
00:04:39,202 --> 00:04:42,638
Sam, may I thank you
bytaking you to dinnertonight?

72
00:04:42,956 --> 00:04:46,744
That's very sweet ofyou, but I was
just trying to be a good Samaritan.

73
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:50,968
- Thanks anyway.
- No, thank you.

74
00:04:51,256 --> 00:04:53,167
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

75
00:04:53,425 --> 00:04:55,541
- Oh, Sam?
- OK. I'd love to go to dinner.

76
00:04:56,887 --> 00:04:59,765
- That's wonderful.
- See? Persistence pays off.

77
00:05:00,057 --> 00:05:02,890
I was going to ask you
to get my parking validated.

78
00:05:03,185 --> 00:05:05,494
But this works out very well, too.

79
00:05:17,491 --> 00:05:20,722
- What are you doing?
- Just watching football with you.

80
00:05:22,663 --> 00:05:24,654
- What's the score?
- 27-20.

81
00:05:24,915 --> 00:05:26,507
Great.

82
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:29,662
- Want to know who's winning?
- Not particularly, no.

83
00:05:29,961 --> 00:05:32,873
Someone has a special evening planned.

84
00:05:33,173 --> 00:05:36,927
What tipped you off?
My incredible self-confident air?

85
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:41,219
No, your silver collar pin. You
only wear it when you've got a hot date.

86
00:05:41,556 --> 00:05:45,390
Good work getting all the tarnish off.
It shined up quite nicely.

87
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:49,489
- Evening, Dr Crane.
- Hello, Daphne. Dad, Frasier.

88
00:05:49,773 --> 00:05:51,809
- You ready to go?
- Give me a minute.

89
00:05:52,067 --> 00:05:55,184
Niles, I can't make it
to the boat show with you and Dad.

90
00:05:55,487 --> 00:06:00,925
- lt'll just be the two ofyou.
- Too bad. Well, maybe some other time.

91
00:06:01,326 --> 00:06:03,965
Goodness. It is a clear night.

92
00:06:05,372 --> 00:06:07,363
It's been rather windy lately.

93
00:06:07,624 --> 00:06:11,299
- Look at those stars. Is that Orion?
- Yes, I believe it is.

94
00:06:11,628 --> 00:06:14,222
What are you doing?
We have a mutual support pact.

95
00:06:14,506 --> 00:06:17,339
When there's a Dad event,
we're there for each other.

96
00:06:17,634 --> 00:06:19,943
I have a date
with a spectacular woman.

97
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:24,179
So what? I gave up Traviata tickets
to support you at a tractor pull.

98
00:06:25,475 --> 00:06:29,024
I thought we could stop
at that medieval restaurant for dinner.

99
00:06:29,354 --> 00:06:31,345
Sounds great, Dad.

100
00:06:33,483 --> 00:06:37,522
Daphne, would you like to use
my ticket for the boat show tonight?

101
00:06:37,863 --> 00:06:39,421
That would be nice.

102
00:06:40,449 --> 00:06:42,440
Very crafty.

103
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,230
Who's the lucky lady?

104
00:06:45,495 --> 00:06:48,692
Her name is Samantha Pierce.
We just met yesterday.

105
00:06:48,999 --> 00:06:51,832
She recognised me from my radio show.

106
00:06:52,127 --> 00:06:54,561
In fact, when I asked her out,

107
00:06:55,797 --> 00:06:57,947
I sensed a shyness
which made me wonder

108
00:06:58,216 --> 00:07:00,491
if she was intimidated by my fame.

109
00:07:00,761 --> 00:07:02,752
Did you say Samantha Pierce?

110
00:07:03,013 --> 00:07:05,288
- Short blonde hair, blue eyes?
- Right.

111
00:07:05,557 --> 00:07:07,707
She's on Larry King.

112
00:07:08,435 --> 00:07:12,030
We're here with noted attorney
Samantha Pierce.

113
00:07:12,356 --> 00:07:17,146
Currently she's trying a case in Seattle
defending "The Butcher Knife Killer".

114
00:07:17,527 --> 00:07:20,246
Sam, do you think
being in the public eye,

115
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:23,283
dating some of the world's
most famous men,

116
00:07:23,575 --> 00:07:25,645
affects the way jurors perceive you?

117
00:07:25,911 --> 00:07:29,540
That's not really fair, Larry.
I don't date public figures.

118
00:07:29,873 --> 00:07:33,786
What about the much-publicised
relationship with Kevin Costner?

119
00:07:34,127 --> 00:07:35,879
Just a rumour.

120
00:07:36,129 --> 00:07:38,359
- George Stephanopoulos?
- A rumour, too.

121
00:07:38,632 --> 00:07:42,591
- Brad Pitt is another rumour?
- Yeah, but I started that one.

122
00:07:45,764 --> 00:07:48,961
I can certainly see
how she'd be intimidated by your fame.

123
00:07:55,774 --> 00:07:59,210
I thought her name sounded familiar.
I must have read it.

124
00:07:59,528 --> 00:08:03,043
Congratulations.
You're playing in the big leagues now.

125
00:08:03,865 --> 00:08:07,335
Kevin Costner, Stephanopoulos,

126
00:08:07,661 --> 00:08:08,650
you...

127
00:08:10,038 --> 00:08:12,916
Don't let him shake your confidence.
You'll be fine.

128
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:17,486
Maybe she's had her fill of attractive
men and is ready for a change.

129
00:08:20,048 --> 00:08:24,838
Aren't I lucky? Normally a troll like me
has to trick a woman to get a date.

130
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:31,056
I once dated a man who had gone out with
several of the top British actresses

131
00:08:31,476 --> 00:08:34,195
but got sick of their vanity
and insecurity.

132
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,709
See, it does happen.

133
00:08:36,982 --> 00:08:41,100
After he got through slumming, he dumped
me and went back to actresses.

134
00:08:41,445 --> 00:08:44,437
He did get me a signed
picture of Helena Bonham Carter.

135
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:47,015
She's riding a pony.

136
00:08:53,999 --> 00:08:57,958
Teddy Kennedy, Henry Kissinger and
the Dalai Lama are on this plane...

137
00:08:58,295 --> 00:09:03,085
- I think I've heard this joke.
- No, this really happened to me.

138
00:09:04,217 --> 00:09:07,971
Well, don't I feel silly.

139
00:09:08,305 --> 00:09:10,978
Never mind,
it's not a very good story anyway.

140
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:16,814
- How's your appetiser?
- It's delicious.

141
00:09:20,275 --> 00:09:22,914
- Your salad?
- It's very good.

142
00:09:23,195 --> 00:09:25,834
Actually, I haven't even tried it yet.

143
00:09:28,533 --> 00:09:30,524
I was right.

144
00:09:34,247 --> 00:09:37,557
I hope this doesn't offend you,
but I've had a stressful day,

145
00:09:37,876 --> 00:09:40,549
and I don't have the energy
to make small talk.

146
00:09:40,837 --> 00:09:44,466
Plus, I'm not very hungry.
Would you mind terribly ifwe just...?

147
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,712
I know where this is headed.
You don't have to say it.

148
00:09:48,011 --> 00:09:51,970
Frasier, could we just go someplace
and have sex?

149
00:09:54,351 --> 00:09:56,342
Well, that you did have to say.

150
00:09:57,938 --> 00:10:00,168
I'm sorry. That sounded forward.

151
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,954
But it's the only thing
I want to do right now.

152
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:09,291
I'm flattered
and the thought is very tempting,

153
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:12,437
but on my show I'm constantly preaching

154
00:10:12,703 --> 00:10:15,376
that people
should get to know one another,

155
00:10:15,664 --> 00:10:18,497
have things in common
before taking that kind of step.

156
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:22,796
- What's your favourite colour?
- Blue.

157
00:10:23,046 --> 00:10:25,037
Mine, too. Check, please.

158
00:10:30,971 --> 00:10:34,008
- How was the boat show?
- It was wonderful.

159
00:10:34,308 --> 00:10:37,539
They had this great exhibit
where you climb into this boat,

160
00:10:37,853 --> 00:10:40,970
put on a life jacket
and they simulate what it's like

161
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:43,503
to be caught out at sea in a hurricane.

162
00:10:49,948 --> 00:10:53,577
Niles, why did you ever agree
to go on a ride like that?

163
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:57,186
I didn't. I dined at the snack bar.

164
00:11:00,167 --> 00:11:04,160
I guess this wasn't a very hot night
for you, huh? Home by 10.30?

165
00:11:04,504 --> 00:11:06,495
Found my bra.

166
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:12,501
This is embarrassing.

167
00:11:12,763 --> 00:11:15,755
Not at all. No, Sam,
this is my brother, Dr Niles Crane,

168
00:11:16,058 --> 00:11:19,892
and my father, Martin Crane, and
his healthcare worker, Daphne Moon.

169
00:11:20,228 --> 00:11:23,459
I've been watching the trial
on TV. It's fascinating.

170
00:11:23,774 --> 00:11:25,492
For us, too.

171
00:11:26,985 --> 00:11:30,978
I'd better get going. I have an early
morning. Lovely meeting all ofyou.

172
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:37,299
- I had a wonderful evening.
- So did l.

173
00:11:39,206 --> 00:11:40,195
Good night.

174
00:11:48,048 --> 00:11:52,678
- I'm off to bed.
- Not so fast, mister.

175
00:11:53,053 --> 00:11:56,568
I can tell by that goofy smile ofyours
that you're smitten.

176
00:11:56,890 --> 00:12:00,963
Thank you, Niles,
but I am not some dewy-eyed teenager.

177
00:12:02,145 --> 00:12:05,660
She did say the cutest things.

178
00:12:05,983 --> 00:12:09,612
She said murderers often show
no remorse for their actions

179
00:12:09,945 --> 00:12:12,334
because they have no moral centre.

180
00:12:15,659 --> 00:12:17,775
It was cute the way she said it.

181
00:12:22,416 --> 00:12:26,967
I want you to taste this
and tell me what you think.

182
00:12:28,213 --> 00:12:31,285
That is spectacular.
Where did you learn how to do that?

183
00:12:31,591 --> 00:12:35,140
Just a little something I picked up
as a child at sauce camp.

184
00:12:41,059 --> 00:12:43,175
Hello. What?

185
00:12:43,437 --> 00:12:47,510
When did this happen? Because we're
expected to give full disclosure.

186
00:12:47,858 --> 00:12:49,849
Can't Brendan handle it?

187
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,099
All right.

188
00:12:52,821 --> 00:12:55,130
I suppose you know
what I'm about to say.

189
00:12:55,407 --> 00:12:58,638
You want to skip dinner again
and go straight to sex?

190
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:04,864
I'm sorry, Frasier. I really am.
You went to all this trouble.

191
00:13:05,542 --> 00:13:10,741
Fine French cooking is always better
after a night in the fridge.

192
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:15,745
We just came back to get our umbrellas.

193
00:13:16,011 --> 00:13:19,845
- No, stay.
- I've been called back to work.

194
00:13:20,182 --> 00:13:24,858
- Don't let a good meal go to waste.
- Morel mushroom and tarragon sauce.

195
00:13:25,228 --> 00:13:26,661
How did you know?

196
00:13:26,897 --> 00:13:30,367
Niles can identify a sauce
from a great distance.

197
00:13:30,692 --> 00:13:32,762
His mother and I were so proud.

198
00:13:36,657 --> 00:13:40,809
If it's not too late, maybe I'll be able
to come back over after.

199
00:13:41,161 --> 00:13:44,631
- Either way I'll call you.
- That's what you said yesterday.

200
00:13:44,956 --> 00:13:49,074
I told you I was sorry about that.
I promise I'll call.

201
00:13:55,342 --> 00:13:57,936
Shame.
And after you cooked that lovely meal.

202
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:01,735
Let me tell you something,
crown roast does not prepare itself.

203
00:14:04,476 --> 00:14:07,752
It's funny.
As much as I care for this woman,

204
00:14:08,897 --> 00:14:12,970
there's something about this
relationship that leaves me unsettled.

205
00:14:14,194 --> 00:14:17,106
I might venture a theory
at which you're sure to hoot.

206
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:22,748
What may be making you uncomfortable
is that

207
00:14:23,036 --> 00:14:26,631
you find yourself
in the more submissive role.

208
00:14:26,957 --> 00:14:29,517
What are you talking about?

209
00:14:29,793 --> 00:14:32,182
I think what he means is
you're the girl.

210
00:14:36,383 --> 00:14:38,943
Think about it.
How did you two first meet?

211
00:14:39,219 --> 00:14:43,212
She came to your rescue. Who initiated
the first sexual encounter? She did.

212
00:14:43,557 --> 00:14:47,311
She did? Who's wearing
the pants in this relationship?

213
00:14:47,644 --> 00:14:51,080
As much fun as it must be for you
to spin out this little theory,

214
00:14:51,398 --> 00:14:53,389
it's without foundation.

215
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:55,641
There's my rosemary bread.

216
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:03,505
If it's any consolation,
I know what you're going through.

217
00:15:03,827 --> 00:15:06,500
Women have put up with it
for generations.

218
00:15:06,788 --> 00:15:08,779
Men say they'll call, and they don't.

219
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:12,716
Or you get a few nice dinners
and then the eventual booty call.

220
00:15:13,962 --> 00:15:15,953
I did not get a booty call.

221
00:15:17,799 --> 00:15:19,790
What's a booty call?

222
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:24,443
A late-night call inviting you to meet,
but with the goal of just having sex.

223
00:15:24,806 --> 00:15:27,081
I did get a booty call.

224
00:15:27,809 --> 00:15:31,722
Frasier, you should nip this thing
in the bud before it gets out of hand.

225
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:35,500
We don't have to look beyond
our own family to find an example

226
00:15:35,817 --> 00:15:38,650
of someone who let a woman
run the show from the start

227
00:15:38,945 --> 00:15:41,095
and has been paying for it ever since.

228
00:15:41,365 --> 00:15:43,356
Poor Uncle Frank.

229
00:15:46,536 --> 00:15:48,527
I'm wasting my time fighting you.

230
00:15:48,789 --> 00:15:51,383
You can take any detail
from this relationship

231
00:15:51,667 --> 00:15:54,465
and twist it
to support your ridiculous theory.

232
00:15:54,753 --> 00:15:57,870
I saw a guy selling these.
I thought they'd cheer you up.

233
00:15:58,173 --> 00:16:00,129
They're beautiful.

234
00:16:01,426 --> 00:16:03,576
- You are so...
- Really got to run.

235
00:16:08,558 --> 00:16:11,675
I suppose now you're going
to read something into this.

236
00:16:18,151 --> 00:16:22,064
- I really love that tie.
- You should. You sent it to me.

237
00:16:22,406 --> 00:16:23,805
Oh, yeah, right.

238
00:16:25,325 --> 00:16:29,955
- Your secretary picked it out.
- He has better taste than I do.

239
00:16:31,415 --> 00:16:34,930
Don't worry about tonight.
I know how boring these parties are

240
00:16:35,252 --> 00:16:37,402
and I promise we won't stay long.

241
00:16:37,671 --> 00:16:38,990
Sam.

242
00:16:39,214 --> 00:16:41,728
Meet our senior partner, Daniel Gill.

243
00:16:42,009 --> 00:16:45,968
How are you? Sam, they're ready
for us on that conference call.

244
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:48,296
It'll just take a minute.

245
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:55,545
You're new.

246
00:16:55,772 --> 00:16:57,364
I'm Frasier.

247
00:16:57,607 --> 00:17:01,043
I'm Jennifer, Stewart's wife.
This is Cindy Dolce.

248
00:17:01,361 --> 00:17:04,558
She's married to Bob.
Terri Bailey. She's living with Ed.

249
00:17:04,865 --> 00:17:09,336
And Vanessa Saint-Claire,
soon to be Mrs lrving Lumpowsky.

250
00:17:09,703 --> 00:17:11,773
Good heavens.

251
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:14,348
How long have you and Sam
been seeing each other?

252
00:17:14,624 --> 00:17:18,299
About three weeks. We haven't
been able to get much time together

253
00:17:18,629 --> 00:17:22,588
but she assures me that'll all change
as soon as the trial's over.

254
00:17:26,386 --> 00:17:29,935
There's always another trial.
But you'll get used to the life.

255
00:17:30,265 --> 00:17:33,098
Dates getting cancelled,
dinners left uneaten.

256
00:17:33,393 --> 00:17:36,226
But at least
you'll get sent plenty of flowers.

257
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:40,040
Jennifer, he's a man.
He won't get flowers.

258
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:46,376
Sam, could I have a word with you
in private, please?

259
00:17:49,618 --> 00:17:51,609
Is there something wrong?

260
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:53,986
It's not the best time
to bring this up,

261
00:17:54,247 --> 00:17:57,205
but I feel
an uneasiness about this relationship.

262
00:17:57,501 --> 00:17:59,014
What do you mean?

263
00:17:59,252 --> 00:18:03,086
I'm not one to get bogged down
in male-female role playing.

264
00:18:03,423 --> 00:18:05,539
It's just that lately...

265
00:18:07,678 --> 00:18:11,193
Take our first date. We'd barely
begun dinner when you suggested

266
00:18:11,515 --> 00:18:13,551
we go to bed together.

267
00:18:13,809 --> 00:18:16,004
Traditionally, that is...

268
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,948
every man's dream. OK, bad example.

269
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:28,638
But then you cancel dates all the time
and you say you'll call and you don't.

270
00:18:29,032 --> 00:18:32,911
And you have your secretary send me
a gift and when I get upset about it,

271
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:35,918
you think
you can buy me offwith flowers.

272
00:18:36,206 --> 00:18:39,596
Is that it? That's what
you dragged me out here for?

273
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:42,955
I'm in the middle of the most intense
case of my career.

274
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:46,930
A man's life hangs in the balance
and you're whining about flowers?

275
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:51,696
- Whining's a little strong.
- Well, tell me what you mean, Frasier.

276
00:18:52,055 --> 00:18:56,810
Ifyou were the one working late hours,
breaking dates and sending gifts,

277
00:18:57,185 --> 00:18:59,904
- would that be OK?
- No, that's not it.

278
00:19:00,188 --> 00:19:03,419
You're a psychiatrist.
Shouldn't you be above all ofthis?

279
00:19:03,734 --> 00:19:06,373
I'm just telling you how I feel.

280
00:19:06,653 --> 00:19:09,565
Do you want to be the traditional man

281
00:19:09,865 --> 00:19:13,175
- and I'll be the put-upon woman?
- No, that's not what I want.

282
00:19:16,621 --> 00:19:21,775
I just wish we could have a relationship
where neither one of us is the man.

283
00:19:22,169 --> 00:19:25,081
So that would make us what?

284
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,371
A lesbian couple?

285
00:19:28,759 --> 00:19:30,750
They're very in now.

286
00:19:32,929 --> 00:19:36,558
Frasier, I know
no one likes being stood up.

287
00:19:36,892 --> 00:19:39,770
I'll try to be more understanding.

288
00:19:40,062 --> 00:19:43,850
And I'll try
to stop being so damn emotional.

289
00:19:46,526 --> 00:19:50,519
I'm glad we had this talk because
I was about to make a big mistake.

290
00:19:50,864 --> 00:19:51,853
What?

291
00:19:52,074 --> 00:19:56,431
The other day when we were in the store
you mentioned you liked something,

292
00:19:56,787 --> 00:19:59,824
and, typical me,
I just ran right out and bought it.

293
00:20:00,123 --> 00:20:03,001
Sort of dodged a bullet there,
didn't we?

294
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:06,160
So what was it?

295
00:20:07,714 --> 00:20:08,703
This.

296
00:20:12,302 --> 00:20:14,372
And you bought this for me?

297
00:20:15,764 --> 00:20:20,121
I'm really rather embarrassed, Frasier.
You were right.

298
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:25,680
I take relationships for granted,
and then I just run offto Cartier

299
00:20:26,024 --> 00:20:28,857
- and buy a gift to make up for it.
- Cartier?

300
00:20:29,987 --> 00:20:34,105
No, I'll return it, I promise.
I know how strongly you feel.

301
00:20:34,449 --> 00:20:37,600
Maybe I've been
a bit self-absorbed lately.

302
00:20:38,161 --> 00:20:41,597
You're a person
who likes to express their affection

303
00:20:41,915 --> 00:20:45,305
by buying gifts.
Who am I to stand in your way?

304
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:53,180
It's lovely.

305
00:20:54,428 --> 00:20:56,658
Frasier, it isn't about the gifts.

306
00:20:56,930 --> 00:21:00,047
I give gifts because
I can never think of the right words.

307
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:02,659
Is this what you're trying to say?

308
00:21:09,985 --> 00:21:11,976
Very well put.

309
00:21:13,488 --> 00:21:15,843
Let's get out of here.
I'll get our coats.

310
00:21:16,116 --> 00:21:18,949
No, I will get our coats.

311
00:21:19,244 --> 00:21:22,759
- You don't know where they are.
- All right. You get them.

312
00:21:25,834 --> 00:21:27,825
I'm so bored. What time is it?

313
00:21:28,086 --> 00:21:30,554
Time? Let's just have a look.

314
00:21:32,841 --> 00:21:36,197
Isn't that fabulous? It's Cartier.
Sam gave it to me.
