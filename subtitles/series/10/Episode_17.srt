1
00:00:08,541 --> 00:00:10,443
Kenny, this is
not amateur hour.

2
00:00:10,744 --> 00:00:12,812
My show is already suffering
enough just losing Roz

3
00:00:12,812 --> 00:00:14,814
I will not let you replace
her with a complete novice

4
00:00:14,814 --> 00:00:16,983
Come on,
don't you remember

5
00:00:17,484 --> 00:00:18,985
when you were
a young whippersnapper

6
00:00:18,985 --> 00:00:20,453
with nothing but
a pantload of talent

7
00:00:20,453 --> 00:00:21,488
and a head full of dreams?

8
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,959
Are we still
talking about Noel?

9
00:00:26,326 --> 00:00:29,763
Five seconds to
launch, Dr. Crane.

10
00:00:30,096 --> 00:00:31,097
Yeah.

11
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:36,336
Good afternoon, Seattle.
This is Dr. Frasier Crane.

12
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:38,772
Before we get to our first call,
I'd like to remind you

13
00:00:38,772 --> 00:00:42,275
that we are losing
our beloved producer, Roz Doyle,

14
00:00:42,275 --> 00:00:44,677
in a couple of weeks
to another career opportunity.

15
00:00:45,011 --> 00:00:46,579
That's KPXY, The Mighty Pixy
.

16
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:48,581
Seattle's more exciting talk.
Whoo-hoo!

17
00:00:52,118 --> 00:00:55,688
In the meantime, we have
with us today Noel Shempsky,

18
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:59,192
a KACL employee whose
sole qualification for this job

19
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:03,029
seems to be that
he's never taken a sick day.

20
00:01:03,296 --> 00:01:07,667
Good afternoon, listeners near
and stars away.

21
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:12,472
Our first query comes from a Class M planet we call Earth

22
00:01:12,472 --> 00:01:15,475
and appears to be
personal in nature.

23
00:01:15,975 --> 00:01:19,245
Oh, and his name is Glen.

24
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:23,850
Go ahead, Glen, I'm listening.

25
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:25,185
Okay, Noel, that was good.

26
00:01:25,685 --> 00:01:28,655
But you need to tell Frasier
the name of the caller,

27
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:31,624
the town they're calling from and why they're calling.

28
00:01:31,624 --> 00:01:32,525
Okay.

29
00:01:32,525 --> 00:01:34,461
You know, maybe
I would learn more

30
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:37,464
if you sat down behind me
and guided my hands,

31
00:01:37,464 --> 00:01:39,466
like they did in Ghost.

32
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:41,434
Oh! Noel!

33
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:44,270
Oh, hi, Julia.

34
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:45,505
Do you mind?

35
00:01:45,505 --> 00:01:47,407
I'm trying to
show Noel what I do.

36
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:50,276
Is that why he's on his knees?

37
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:54,147
Get up.

38
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:57,650
Let me give you
some pointers on
call screening.

39
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:00,587
Your first priority are your leapers and jumpers.

40
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:02,522
Next up, angry people.

41
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:04,524
They're great energy
and a welcome change

42
00:02:04,524 --> 00:02:07,026
from our largest group,
the sad sacks.

43
00:02:07,026 --> 00:02:09,529
The trick of it is you want
to arrange all of these calls

44
00:02:10,029 --> 00:02:12,031
so that each segment
is "can't miss" radio.

45
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:13,500
But I thought
it was just about

46
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,768
Frasier doing good work.

47
00:02:15,768 --> 00:02:17,537
Please!
It's all about ratings.

48
00:02:18,037 --> 00:02:19,539
If the station had its way,

49
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:23,309
every call would end
in an auto-erotic suicide.

50
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:24,577
Thank you, Roz.

51
00:02:24,577 --> 00:02:27,080
Now that Seattle knows
how we do things around here,

52
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,082
perhaps you could
let Noel know

53
00:02:29,582 --> 00:02:32,085
to keep his elbow
off the mic button.

54
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:40,927
we'll do paper
work together?

55
00:02:41,127 --> 00:02:42,629
(flat):
Yeah, it's really sad.

56
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:46,799
What exactly is
the new job, Roz?

57
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,535
Program director.

58
00:02:48,801 --> 00:02:50,870
Now that's a job.

59
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:53,706
Let me give you
a little piece of advice.

60
00:02:53,706 --> 00:02:57,477
Less smut and
more older-people shows.

61
00:02:57,477 --> 00:02:58,878
Yeah, I know, Martin,

62
00:02:58,878 --> 00:02:59,812
but that's not exactly
what they're going for.

63
00:02:59,812 --> 00:03:01,247
Well, why not?

64
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:03,716
You could have a show
about owning dogs.

65
00:03:03,716 --> 00:03:05,185
Or how about this?

66
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,687
A show where people just call in
with jokes they've heard

67
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:09,088
That'd be a riot.

68
00:03:09,088 --> 00:03:11,024
I think they're looking for a wider audience

69
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,992
than just you, Dad.

70
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:14,460
Lots of people
would be interested

71
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,929
in that sort of thing.

72
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:18,765
Yeah, but the advertisers are
looking for the young dollars.

73
00:03:18,765 --> 00:03:19,966
What's wrong with my money?

74
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:21,801
You don't spend it all
on fast food and beer.

75
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:24,170
Yes, I do.

76
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:27,640
You know, I'’m tired
of society blowing me off

77
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,042
just because
I'm a senior citizen.

78
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,910
You know,
one day we're gonna rise

79
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:33,446
and take this country back
from you young smart alecks.

80
00:03:33,446 --> 00:03:35,915
And it won't be pretty either.

81
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:38,751
I could mention
the joke idea to my boss.

82
00:03:38,751 --> 00:03:41,421
You just bought yourself
a little more time.

83
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:44,791
Well, here it is, Roz,

84
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:48,127
the final parking requisition form.

85
00:03:48,127 --> 00:03:50,430
The end of an era.

86
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:53,433
Listen, I know that Kenny is giving you a going away party

87
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:55,935
but I wanted to have a
little celebratory dinner,

88
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:57,437
just the two of us, all right?

89
00:03:57,437 --> 00:03:58,905
Any night you're free.

90
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,440
Well, Niles and Daphne
are watching Alice.

91
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,441
How about tonight?

92
00:04:01,941 --> 00:04:04,377
Well, actually,
I'm meeting Julia later.

93
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:07,080
Why would you
want to do that?

94
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,618
Well, we've sort of been
seeing each other lately.

95
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:13,453
You and Julia?

96
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:15,888
She's a total bitch.

97
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:19,325
Now, Roz, if you took the time
to get to know her,

98
00:04:19,325 --> 00:04:21,361
you'd see that she's
really not such a bad person.

99
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:24,197
Like get to know her naked,
you mean.

100
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:26,499
No.

101
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:28,901
I think she's
been misjudged.

102
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:30,303
Sure, she has a lot of walls up,

103
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:32,805
but, I mean, there must be
something good inside

104
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:34,240
if it needs
that much protection.

105
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,175
Yeah, well, there are walls
around prisons, too.

106
00:04:36,175 --> 00:04:37,143
Yes. Fine.

107
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:39,646
Your opinion
has been noted.

108
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:42,148
There are walls
around insane asylums, cholera wards...

109
00:04:42,148 --> 00:04:44,651
Thank you, Roz.
nuclear facilities,
gator farms...

110
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:46,152
All right, shut up.

111
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:49,656
Got you!

112
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:50,990
Oh.

113
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:52,158
Now you chase me.

114
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:54,661
(anguished laughter):
Oh...

115
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:55,962
No, I think
it's Daphne's turn.

116
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,798
Oh, no, I just had
four turns in a row.

117
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,266
But you know who does
want a turn?

118
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:02,735
The TV.

119
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:05,738
There you go.
Your video's all cued up

120
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,741
(sighs)

121
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:09,676
Should we really be
plopping her

122
00:05:10,176 --> 00:05:11,044
in front of the tube?

123
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:12,345
It's an educational tape

124
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:16,282
Did you want to read her
more Jung for Jungsters?

125
00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:18,251
She doesn't seem
to respond to it.

126
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:20,687
Perhaps that's a treat
we'll save for our own child

127
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:21,754
When will that be?

128
00:05:21,754 --> 00:05:23,690
When are we going to have
a child of our own?

129
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:25,658
Oh, I don't know,
when we're ready.

130
00:05:25,664 --> 00:05:26,726
Yes, we always say that,

131
00:05:27,226 --> 00:05:28,728
but how will we know
Yes, when we're ready?

132
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:30,730
I mean, if it were just me,
I'm ready right now.

133
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,131
Really?

134
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:35,468
I just don't feel like
we're quite there yet.

135
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:36,836
What has to change?

136
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:41,541
What's this little brat
doing here?

137
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:45,011
Make sure it don't
make any noise.

138
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:47,013
I'm resting.

139
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:50,516
Maybe it's
my biorhythms.

140
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:52,518
Daphne, might it have
something to do with

141
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:55,288
your mother
living with us?
(toy squeaks)

142
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:57,557
Well, I've always thought in the back of my head

143
00:05:58,057 --> 00:05:59,892
that we'd start a
family after she left.

144
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,260
Well, but that doesn't
have to stop us

145
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:02,762
from getting pregnant.

146
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:04,263
And once we are,
we've got nine months

147
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:05,231
to get her out of the house.

148
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:06,666
Are you kidding?

149
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:08,568
If she found out there was a grandchild on the way,

150
00:06:09,068 --> 00:06:10,069
she'd never leave.

151
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:11,571
And I don't
think I could take Mum

152
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:13,573
and morning sickness
at the same time.

153
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:16,209
Well, on the other hand,

154
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:19,078
a grandmother can be
a wonderful influence
on a child.

155
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:21,314
Alice...

156
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:24,250
you help Auntie Gert
find her cigarettes,

157
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,552
and you can have one.

158
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:35,795
(clinking glass)

159
00:06:36,295 --> 00:06:38,765
I think now would be a good time
if anyone wants to stand up,

160
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:40,800
say a few words to Roz.

161
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,235
I know I'll miss her.

162
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:44,570
Which is why I'm proud to present her with...

163
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:48,975
this picture of the two of us
at the last company picnic.

164
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:50,977
Won't that baby look nice in a frame?

165
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:52,979
Yeah.
Enjoy.

166
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:56,916
I'm next.

167
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:05,825
"Sweetest Roz, you are my ship
when I'm at sea,

168
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:08,728
"my fairest rose, my fantasy.

169
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:11,130
"With each sunrise, my thanks I send

170
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:14,434
for you, my love,
my true best friend."

171
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,035
Aw, that's...

172
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:17,804
Puke!

173
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:20,273
That was beautiful, you son of a b.

174
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,307
Okay, every...

175
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:22,308
Sit down.

176
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:23,810
Sit down, Noel.
Sit down.

177
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:25,311
Okay, everybody,
Bulldog to the rescue.

178
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:27,313
Now...

179
00:07:27,313 --> 00:07:30,316
I don't want to say Roz
has had a lot of sex,

180
00:07:30,316 --> 00:07:33,152
but she's spent more time
on her back than King Tut.

181
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:39,325
Did you hear the story
about the guy at KACL

182
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:41,327
who didn'thave sex with Roz?

183
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:43,329
Me neither.

184
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:45,331
But, uh, seriously--

185
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:48,134
What's the difference between Roz and a dog in heat?

186
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:51,871
No, really, I'm asking.

187
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:53,773
You people suck!

188
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:56,642
It's not a roast, Bulldog.

189
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:58,010
It's not?

190
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:59,579
I paid a guy
at the Chuckle Factory

191
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:01,481
50 bucks to write jokes for me.

192
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,716
When's he getting here?

193
00:08:03,716 --> 00:08:06,886
Okay, okay...
you want a speech?

194
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:08,754
Best of luck
in your new job, Roz.

195
00:08:08,754 --> 00:08:10,656
If you're ever
need a sports guy,

196
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:12,024
I'm your man.

197
00:08:12,024 --> 00:08:15,094
And I wouldn't have any problem with you being my boss.

198
00:08:15,094 --> 00:08:17,029
After all,
I know what it feels like

199
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:19,098
to be underneath you,
am I right?

200
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:23,803
Watch what you say about her!

201
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:25,280
FRASIER:
Noel, Bulldog, come on!

202
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,373
Walk it off, Noel.
Walk it off. Go on.

203
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:31,043
Careful, gents

204
00:08:31,043 --> 00:08:33,012
Really, the way you two
are always carrying on,

205
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:35,047
people are going
to start talking.

206
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:38,050
Hello, all.

207
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:42,054
Gil Chesterton here,
with a toast to Roz Doyle.

208
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:43,556
Hear, hear.

209
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:45,892
A wonderful co-worker
and a good friend.

210
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:47,760
Hear, hear.
Hear, hear.

211
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,195
Of course, I, too,

212
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:52,098
noticed Roz's sex appeal immediately

213
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:57,403
She had the same effect on all of us stallions
in the KACL corral.

214
00:08:57,403 --> 00:09:03,476
She made us want to paw the ground

215
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:05,978
fetlocks glistening.

216
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:10,483
Smokey, Misty,
Storm! Away!

217
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:17,590
Okay, bar's closed.

218
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:18,925
Gil?... (whistles)

219
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:22,094
Uh, Julia, your turn.

220
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:23,596
Oh. Uh...

221
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:27,099
Well, I've only
known Roz a short time,

222
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:30,603
but I can see that
she's a valuable
member of this team.

223
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:32,505
And I'm sure
you'll be missed.

224
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:34,440
Good luck.

225
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,443
Well said, well said.
Uh...

226
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:39,445
(clears throat)

227
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:40,813
Roz...

228
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:44,050
I celebrate your new
adventure with you.

229
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:46,352
But I wouldn't be honest
if I didn't say

230
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:48,854
that this is a big loss for me.

231
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:52,358
You were there
on my very first day at KACL

232
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:54,226
and you took me under your wing.

233
00:09:54,226 --> 00:09:57,630
It's crowded under there

234
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:01,133
(whispers):
I will kill you.

235
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:09,108
I don't think
I'll ever grow accustomed

236
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:11,877
to seeing somebody else
in your booth.

237
00:10:11,877 --> 00:10:13,646
And certainly no one else
can ever take your place

238
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:15,615
in our hearts.

239
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:20,386
And while we welcome
new friends,

240
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:26,158
we are sad to say
good-bye to old ones.

241
00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:27,059
Good luck, Roz

242
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:28,461
Hear, hear

243
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,463
Speech.
Come on, Roz.

244
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:31,731
Speech, speech!

245
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:35,801
(clears throat)

246
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:37,570
Thanks, you guys.

247
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:42,508
I just love you all
for doing this for me.

248
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:44,977
We really are like a family,
aren't we?

249
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:48,481
You know, this job at KPXY

250
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:51,250
is a really great,
great opportunity,

251
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:55,021
but it'll never be like this

252
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:57,523
Which is why
I'm changing my mind.

253
00:10:58,024 --> 00:10:59,525
I can't leave KACL.
I'm staying.

254
00:10:59,525 --> 00:11:01,861
Really?!

255
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:04,196
(cheering)

256
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:19,211
uh, we'd like to get two double lattes to go, please.

257
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:22,415
For an extra dollar,
I can add a nip of brandy.

258
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:25,084
Is that on the menu?

259
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:28,187
It's on the secret menu.

260
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:30,823
I'll pass, thank you.

261
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,627
You know, Frasier,
I feel so invigorated

262
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:36,128
to get back
to my old job.

263
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:37,129
Oh, Roz...

264
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:38,130
In fact, I'd really like to record

265
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:39,565
some promos tonight,
if you're available.

266
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:41,033
Oh, I can't.

267
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:42,535
I'm taking Julia
to the movies.

268
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,804
One of my favorites:
Noch Einen Stuhl.

269
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:46,539
Noch Einen Stuhl?

270
00:11:46,939 --> 00:11:49,508
Yes. It's the story
of a 19th-century
Austrian family

271
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:53,012
as told from the point of view
of an old fireside armchair.

272
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,348
I'm sorry, I dozed off.

273
00:11:56,348 --> 00:11:57,683
What were you saying?

274
00:11:57,983 --> 00:12:00,019
I've got to get
an alternative newspaper

275
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:01,020
to check show times.

276
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,021
I'll be right back.

277
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:03,489
Here we are.

278
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:04,990
Oh...

279
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:07,493
(phone ringing)

280
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:08,994
Your phone's ringing.

281
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:10,496
Oh, it's not mine, it's Frasier's.

282
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:12,298
(ringing continues)

283
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:14,600
Ew! It's Julia.

284
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:16,135
Who's that?

285
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:18,204
Oh, this witch who'’s trying to get her
hooks into Frasier.

286
00:12:18,204 --> 00:12:20,206
I hate her.

287
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:22,208
I'll fix her.

288
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:24,110
Wh-Wh-What
are you doing?

289
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:26,545
(sultry):
♪♪ Hello. ♪♪

290
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:28,047
Oh, I'm sorry.

291
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:30,049
Frasier's in no position
to talk,

292
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:31,817
if you, uh, get my meaning.

293
00:12:32,017 --> 00:12:34,553
Who is this, then?

294
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:37,022
Hold on.

295
00:12:37,022 --> 00:12:40,526
Sweetheart, do you want to talk
to a Julia?

296
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:43,395
(giggling):
Oh, Frasier, put me down.

297
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:46,265
(both snickering)

298
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:50,269
Sorry, he's not here
after all. Bye, now.

299
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:53,072
There.
Problem solved.

300
00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:55,474
You know, you probably ruined
their entire evening.

301
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:57,843
How can I thank you?

302
00:12:57,843 --> 00:13:00,746
Only one showing of
Noch Einen Stuhltonight.

303
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:01,247
Got to
 go by the box office

304
00:13:01,747 --> 00:13:02,748
and pick up
the tickets.

305
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:05,251
Yes, I bet
they're going fast.

306
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:06,252
Hello!
Oh, sorry!

307
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:07,753
Wish we could join you guys.

308
00:13:07,753 --> 00:13:09,755
I'm going to get tickets for Noch Einen Stuhl!

309
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:11,757
Cutting it a little close,
aren't you?

310
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:15,261
Hey, Mum.

311
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:17,263
When you've finished your shift, we'll drive you home.

312
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:19,031
Really?

313
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:20,766
Are you sure it wouldn't
give you more pleasure

314
00:13:20,766 --> 00:13:24,136
to see me walk home
on my bloody stumps?

315
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:26,405
Well, it would,
but we're in a hurry.

316
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:28,407
We'll be here
when you're ready.

317
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:31,443
Oh, Niles...

318
00:13:31,443 --> 00:13:32,945
Oh...

319
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:34,947
Just think, one day,
we'll have one of those.

320
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:37,449
Yes. Just
one awkward chore

321
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:38,851
to get out of the way.

322
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:42,555
Well, that's romantic.

323
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:44,657
I meant asking your mother
to move out.

324
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:45,991
We're not
asking her, Niles.

325
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:47,493
We're telling her.
I know. I know.

326
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:48,994
You have to be firm.
Yes.

327
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:49,995
This is a woman
who came for week

328
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:50,996
and stayed for
a year and a half.

329
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:52,498
Yes, I know.
I just think that...

330
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:53,499
It's not like she's
got no place to go.

331
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:54,500
She's got seven
other children!

332
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,501
I know

333
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,002
Plus, a home
and friends in England.

334
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:58,003
Many friends, yes.

335
00:13:58,504 --> 00:13:59,438
I just... I...

336
00:13:59,805 --> 00:14:01,774
I just don't know
how to break it to her.

337
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:03,142
Well, the sooner we do,

338
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:05,411
the sooner can start
our own family.

339
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:07,179
You're right.

340
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,682
Do you realize,
this time next year,

341
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:12,484
we could be sitting here
with our own baby?

342
00:14:12,718 --> 00:14:15,287
Baby?

343
00:14:15,287 --> 00:14:16,789
What's this, then?

344
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:18,224
We'll talk about it later.

345
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:20,593
I want to talk about it now.
What's going on?

346
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,528
Well, I was going
to wait until later,

347
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,029
but if you really
want to know, we...

348
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,332
Wait, wait,
Daphne, Daphne
... (clears throat)

349
00:14:29,301 --> 00:14:31,270
Oh, well,
I'm glad you

350
00:14:33,138 --> 00:14:34,206
I was beginning to think

351
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,175
there might be something wrong
with your equipment, Niles.

352
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:38,077
Oh, were you?

353
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:40,512
Well, here's more news:
You're out of the house,

354
00:14:40,512 --> 00:14:42,014
so pack your bags
and find another sucker.

355
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:45,017
Uh, excuse me,

356
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:47,019
could I get
some service over here?

357
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:48,520
Keep your knickers on.

358
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:50,022
Don't move.

359
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:51,857
We're not done
hashing this through.

360
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:56,662
♪♪ Hello. ♪♪

361
00:14:56,662 --> 00:14:59,598
(suspiciously)
: Hello.

362
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,737
♪♪ Hello. ♪♪

363
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:08,641
Say that again.

364
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:11,744
♪♪ Hello? ♪♪

365
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:15,581
Now say, "Frasier's in no position to talk,

366
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,483


if you get my meaning."

367
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:21,253
Now, it was all Roz's idea

368
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:23,489
I had no choice.

369
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:25,724
I'm not a well woman.

370
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:35,234
Hello, Roz.

371
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:36,201
Julia.

372
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:37,202
(shuts door)

373
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:39,705
I just talked to that waitress
over at Nervosa.

374
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:41,473
The one that answered
Frasier's phone.

375
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:43,175
She gave you up immediately.

376
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:44,076
(laughing):
Relax.

377
00:15:44,576 --> 00:15:46,011
It was just a joke.

378
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:47,980
Okay.

379
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,481
So, what's going on?

380
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:51,951
Do you have some sort of problem
with me seeing Frasier?

381
00:15:52,384 --> 00:15:54,853
Well, as long as
you're asking...

382
00:15:55,187 --> 00:15:57,589
I think you're all wrong
for him.

383
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:59,358
That's not your call.

384
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:03,095
I think I know Frasier
a little better than you.

385
00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:14,573
So?

386
00:16:14,573 --> 00:16:16,075
So...

387
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:18,077
he deserves
someone better.

388
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:19,945
Someone who'll
appreciate him.

389
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:20,846
Oh, really?

390
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:22,147
Yeah.

391
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:23,482
Frasier's a good guy.

392
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:25,451
He's smart and sweet
and way too good for you.

393
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:26,952
Why don't you just leave

394
00:16:26,952 --> 00:16:28,420
Nobody here
likes you, anyway.

395
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:30,689
Frasier seems to.

396
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:32,024
Well, he's an idiot.

397
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:36,795
Are you trying to save Frasier
from me

398
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:38,697
or are you trying to save him
for yourself?

399
00:16:39,064 --> 00:16:40,933
Are you out of your mind?

400
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:42,301
You in love with him?

401
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:43,802
Go to hell, Julia.

402
00:16:43,802 --> 00:16:45,804
That would explain why you
turned down that great job

403
00:16:45,804 --> 00:16:47,306
That is not true.

404
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:48,807
Then stay out of my way.

405
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:50,809
Or what?

406
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:51,710
Do you want
to find out?

407
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:53,412
What, are you going
to hit me or something?

408
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:54,680
Don't think I won't.

409
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,648
Well, you're sure
taking your time.

410
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:04,723
Stay away from him.

411
00:17:04,723 --> 00:17:06,191
Got it?

412
00:17:09,294 --> 00:17:10,796
Get out of here!

413
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:18,303
Well, I guess
this is good-bye.

414
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:20,305
Um, I just
want you to know,

415
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:22,274
I love you both
very much,

416
00:17:22,274 --> 00:17:23,675
and I'm, you know,
looking forward

417
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:25,611
to standing
on my own two feet again.

418
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:27,012
Uh...

419
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:30,516
Thank you for the ticket,
and the luggage

420
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:33,018
and the clothes
and the spending money.

421
00:17:33,018 --> 00:17:34,019
(gasping)

422
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:36,955
I'm sorry.
This is just so sad.

423
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:38,857
Gertrude, are you sure you're okay--

424
00:17:38,857 --> 00:17:40,859
Good-bye, Mum.
Have a nice trip.

425
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:42,828
Say hello to everyone
in Manchester for me.

426
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:44,830
Right, then.

427
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:47,833
Good-bye, Niles.

428
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:49,334
Good-bye.

429
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:52,337
I know you'll be
a wonderful father

430
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:54,807
to my grandchild.

431
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:58,644
I hope you'’ll find time
to send me a picture.

432
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:00,012
Well, can't we
all just talk...

433
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:02,014
We have your address.

434
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,219
I'm off.

435
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:08,120
Bye.

436
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:11,623
(sighs)

437
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:13,125
Oh, Daphne, you were wonderful

438
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,626
I don't know
how you did it

439
00:18:14,626 --> 00:18:16,628
(sobbing)

440
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:18,564
Hold me, Niles.

441
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:20,099
(sobbing)

442
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:23,836
Hang on. Hang on.

443
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:25,070
Gertrude!

444
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:26,105
(sobbing):
Yes?

445
00:18:28,373 --> 00:18:29,741
Come here, come here.

446
00:18:29,975 --> 00:18:31,743
Uh...

447
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:34,079
Would you be willing
to stay in Seattle

448
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:36,415
if-if, say, you had
your own apartment?

449
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,749
Oh, Niles...

450
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:39,218
Do you really mean that?

451
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:40,185
I mean, I don't want
to intrude.

452
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:41,653
Well, of course I mean it.

453
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:43,956
And-And-And we'd
even help with the rent.

454
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:46,291
Define "help."

455
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,093
We'll talk.

456
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:49,428
Well, then, it's settled

457
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:50,929
I'll just go tell the taxi I'm not going.

458
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:52,431
No, no, no, you're going

459
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:54,933
Just tell them to take you
to the Four Seasons.

460
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:57,369
I'll go ahead and call
and book you a room.

461
00:18:57,369 --> 00:19:00,272
You've made me so happy,
I think I'm going to cry.

462
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:01,140
Oh, come here...
(Niles laughing)

463
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:05,911
Niles, I...

464
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:07,913
I don't know
how to thank you.

465
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,420
I do.

466
00:19:19,424 --> 00:19:20,425
Hey, Martin.

467
00:19:20,425 --> 00:19:21,426
Hi, Roz.
Come in.

468
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:22,427
Is Frasier here?

469
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:23,428
I really need
to talk to him

470
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:25,430
No, he went out
for dinner.

471
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:27,432
Oh, let me guess: Julia.

472
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:29,935
Wow. Not a fan, huh?

473
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:31,436
I can't stand her,
actually.

474
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:32,437
(chuckling):
Really!

475
00:19:32,938 --> 00:19:33,939
Well, I just met her
this evening,

476
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:35,440
but she seemed nice to me.

477
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,309
Well, that's because
she's got you snowed.

478
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:38,844
She's a mean, snooty tight-ass

479
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,846
who thinks she's better
than everybody else,

480
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,347
and Frasier's making
a giant mistake,

481
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,650
and somebody's got to do
something about it.

482
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:45,984
Well, good luck.

483
00:19:45,984 --> 00:19:48,353
When Frasier's heart takes over, his brain shuts down.

484
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:50,689
That's why we have to do
something now,

485
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:53,525
before this relationship
gets any closer.

486
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:55,827
Will you help me?

487
00:19:55,827 --> 00:19:57,829
Well, Roz, if you feel
that strongly about it

488
00:19:57,829 --> 00:19:59,331
sure, I'll back you up.

489
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:00,766
(door opening)

490
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:02,167
Oh, hi, guys.

491
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:03,168
MARTIN: Hi.
Hi

492
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:04,236
Hi, Roz.

493
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:05,671
Hello, Roz.
Nice to see you.

494
00:20:06,171 --> 00:20:06,672
Julia.

495
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:07,706
Martin, I've brought you

496
00:20:08,173 --> 00:20:10,742
some cake from the restaurant.

497
00:20:10,742 --> 00:20:12,244
Restaurant cake!

498
00:20:14,746 --> 00:20:16,114
Steady...

499
00:20:16,114 --> 00:20:17,449
It's chocolate-- why don't I

500
00:20:17,449 --> 00:20:18,917
cut you a slice
and pour you some milk.

501
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:23,689
New plan.

502
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:26,091
I'll distract her
while you talk to Frasier.

503
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,361
What's going on, Roz?

504
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:30,862
I didn't expect
to see you tonight.

505
00:20:30,862 --> 00:20:31,863
Well, um,
I have something

506
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:33,865
really important
to talk to you about,

507
00:20:33,865 --> 00:20:35,367
and I really need you
to listen to me.

508
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:36,301
Well, absolutely.

509
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:39,037
That's what I do.

510
00:20:39,037 --> 00:20:40,872
I really, really,
really think

511
00:20:40,872 --> 00:20:42,874
you should
stop seeing Julia.

512
00:20:44,376 --> 00:20:46,878
Look, I know you two
have your difficulties

513
00:20:46,878 --> 00:20:47,879
No, it's not that.

514
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,881
She's all wrong for you.

515
00:20:51,883 --> 00:20:53,385
I think I see what's going on here.

516
00:20:53,885 --> 00:20:55,387
You and I have a
close relationship

517
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:57,389
A new woman comes
to the radio station,

518
00:20:57,389 --> 00:20:58,890
she and I form a
close relationship

519
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:01,226
and you feel threatened.

520
00:21:01,226 --> 00:21:03,862
No. She's evil.

521
00:21:03,862 --> 00:21:06,431
It's not your fault.

522
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:09,067
You can't see it because
she puts on an act around you.

523
00:21:09,067 --> 00:21:10,435
Did it ever occur to you
that maybe

524
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:11,436
she's putting on an act
for everybody else,

525
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:12,804
and maybe I see her
as she really is?

526
00:21:12,804 --> 00:21:15,540
Oh, she's got you
totally brainwashed!

527
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,376
Roz, you have no right
to come over here

528
00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:18,377
and run her down to me.

529
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:20,178
It's really
none of your business.

530
00:21:20,178 --> 00:21:21,346
This is my business.

531
00:21:21,346 --> 00:21:22,180
And why?

532
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:24,082
Because...

533
00:21:24,082 --> 00:21:26,585
we're friends.

534
00:21:27,085 --> 00:21:29,588
I can't believe you're turning on me like this!

535
00:21:29,588 --> 00:21:32,090
I gave up a job
that was ten times better

536
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:33,592
to stay on your show!

537
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:34,860
Yes, and frankly, I
don't understand that!

538
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:37,129
Why, exactly,
did you turn down that job?

539
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:39,064
Out of loyalty to you!

540
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:40,065
Loyalty to me! Are you sure?

541
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:41,566
Are you sure it wasn't just fear?

542
00:21:41,566 --> 00:21:44,069
Are you sure you're not just using me as an excuse

543
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:45,003
not to grow and move on?

544
00:21:45,003 --> 00:21:46,772
Who wants restaurant cake?

545
00:21:49,107 --> 00:21:52,077
You're going to have
to choose, Frasier.

546
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:54,012
You will not put me
in this position, Roz.

547
00:21:54,012 --> 00:21:55,013
We will discuss it later.

548
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:57,516
No! Tell me!

549
00:21:57,516 --> 00:21:59,318
It's her or me!

550
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,520
Tell me now,
or I swear to God,

551
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,022
I will walk out of here
and I will not come back!

552
00:22:09,695 --> 00:22:10,696
Thank you, Julia.

553
00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:12,597
I think I will have some cake.

554
00:22:18,403 --> 00:22:19,271
(weakly):
Fine.

555
00:22:25,077 --> 00:22:26,144
(door closes)

556
00:22:30,615 --> 00:22:33,151
And this will be
your office, Ms. Doyle

557
00:22:33,151 --> 00:22:34,152
Make yourself at home.

558
00:22:34,653 --> 00:22:36,621
Thank you, Mr. Wiswell

559
00:22:36,621 --> 00:22:39,124
Uh, there's no chance

560
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:40,592
you'll change your mind again, is there?

561
00:22:40,992 --> 00:22:43,962
No. KACL is ancient history.

562
00:22:44,262 --> 00:22:45,831
