1
00:00:08,074 --> 00:00:09,576
What is this?

2
00:00:10,076 --> 00:00:13,580
"St. Osric's Prekindergarten Academy and Daycare Center"?

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,083
Do I hear the pitter-patter
of petite elite feet?

4
00:00:17,083 --> 00:00:18,985
No, no, no.

5
00:00:19,319 --> 00:00:20,387
It's just that
the wait list

6
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:22,389
for St. Osric's
is up to four years,
Oh.

7
00:00:22,389 --> 00:00:24,864
so I thought we should
get our application
in now to be safe.

8
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:26,593
Very wise, Niles.

9
00:00:26,593 --> 00:00:29,095
You know, Lilith and I waited
until Frederick was conceived

10
00:00:29,095 --> 00:00:30,563
before we enrolled him
in private school.

11
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:32,365
Mr. Procrastinator.
Well, you know.

12
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:33,767
It's prekindergarten--

13
00:00:33,767 --> 00:00:35,769
they run around,
they sing, they nap.

14
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:37,270
How special
can St. Osric's really be?

15
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:41,141
Well, I hear the top two percent
in coloring and putting away

16
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:42,942
can pretty much
write their own ticket.

17
00:00:44,744 --> 00:00:48,248
Oh, Niles, guess
who's coming to visit.

18
00:00:48,248 --> 00:00:49,582
Leland Barton.

19
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:51,451
Really? From the Empire Club?

20
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:52,952
No, no. That's Barton Leland
.

21
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:55,722
Leland Barton was Mom's research assistant.

22
00:00:55,922 --> 00:00:57,424
They worked together closely
for years.

23
00:00:57,791 --> 00:00:59,225
I don't remember him.
Oh, that's right.

24
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:01,094
We were just boys
when he moved to France.

25
00:01:01,594 --> 00:01:02,595
Apparently he
gave up psychiatry

26
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:04,964
and immersed himself
in the Paris art world.

27
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:06,332
Today,

28
00:01:06,766 --> 00:01:10,603
he sits on the board of
the Paris Museum of Modern Art.

29
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:14,874
Wow. Takes a brave man
to just chuck it all,
Mm.

30
00:01:14,874 --> 00:01:17,877
cross the ocean in pursuit
of a new life in a new country.

31
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:18,812
Or a brave woman.

32
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:20,313
Oh, yes,
that's absolutely right.

33
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:21,781
That's exactly
what you did.

34
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,149
Just like Dr. Barton,

35
00:01:23,149 --> 00:01:25,652
you bade farewell to
the comforts of hearth and home

36
00:01:25,652 --> 00:01:28,455
and filled your sails with the
winds of change and adventure.

37
00:01:28,721 --> 00:01:30,290
Well, I never looked at it
that way.

38
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:32,792
Now I'll have something
to think about this afternoon

39
00:01:32,792 --> 00:01:34,794
when I'm rubbing
your dad's bum.

40
00:01:37,797 --> 00:01:39,299
(sighs)

41
00:01:42,902 --> 00:01:44,471
Hello, Roz
Hi.

42
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:46,172
Hey, Roz.
How was the dog park?

43
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,007
Well, I got a phone number.

44
00:01:48,007 --> 00:01:49,309
Oh, nice.

45
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:52,378
Is that why you people
have pets-- to get dates?

46
00:01:52,645 --> 00:01:53,713
No, but it's a plus.

47
00:01:53,713 --> 00:01:55,215
I've never met one person

48
00:01:55,715 --> 00:01:58,718
who didn't get at least one date through their pet.

49
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:01,187
Well, meet me.

50
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:03,189
Four years in high school

51
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:05,692
and not a single encounter
generated.

52
00:02:05,692 --> 00:02:08,027
Stupid fish.

53
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:09,896
(doorbell rings)

54
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:11,397
Oh, that would be Leland.

55
00:02:11,397 --> 00:02:13,399
Who's Leland?
He was Hester's
research assistant.

56
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,368
Used to follow her around
like a puppy.

57
00:02:15,368 --> 00:02:18,705
I think he was always a little
bit jealous of me, to be honest.

58
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,408
Not that he was alone.

59
00:02:23,843 --> 00:02:24,878
Dr. Barton

60
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:26,679
Hello, Frasier.
I'm Frasier.
Good to see you.

61
00:02:26,946 --> 00:02:28,515
How are you?
Let me take that for you.

62
00:02:28,515 --> 00:02:30,016
Thank you very much.

63
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:32,018
Thank you, thank you.
Hello.

64
00:02:32,018 --> 00:02:33,786
My God, look at you!

65
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,455
I haven't seen you
since you were about, what,

66
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:36,890
seven years old?

67
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,892
And you still look good
in a suit.

68
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:40,260
Oh...

69
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:43,696
Martin, you have not
changed a whit.

70
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:45,698
Oh, my hair's gray,
and I got a bullet in my hip.

71
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:48,201
Well, I'm bigger and balder,

72
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:49,569
but I don't want
to hear about it.

73
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:52,172
But you look exactly
the same, too.

74
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:53,406
Thank you, sir.

75
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:55,375
And you must be...?

76
00:02:55,742 --> 00:02:58,811
I'm assuming you don't go by Niles anymore.

77
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:03,550
No, this-this is my producer,
Roz Doyle.

78
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:04,484
My brother's not here.

79
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:06,419
Oh...

80
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:08,454
(chuckles)

81
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:09,455
My sincerest apologies.

82
00:03:09,455 --> 00:03:10,957
You are a handsome woman.

83
00:03:11,457 --> 00:03:12,192
Oh.

84
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:14,093
And it's nice to meet you, too

85
00:03:14,093 --> 00:03:15,495
I guess I should be going.

86
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:16,930
Oh, not on my
account, I hope.

87
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,264
FRASIER:
Please, Roz,
stay if you like.

88
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:19,432
Can I get anybody a drink?

89
00:03:19,732 --> 00:03:21,301
Well, not unless you happen
to have any sherry.

90
00:03:21,734 --> 00:03:22,268
(chuckles heartily)

91
00:03:22,735 --> 00:03:26,306
I think I can
scare up a glass. Roz?

92
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:27,774
Well, I'll have
a beer, please.

93
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:30,243
Well, I can handle that.

94
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:31,644
Come, sit down.

95
00:03:31,644 --> 00:03:33,146
Well, thank you.

96
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:35,181
So, I hear you worked
with Frasier's mom.

97
00:03:35,181 --> 00:03:36,182
Yes, I did

98
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:37,150
Did you know her?

99
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,451
No.
Oh, pity.

100
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:41,287
She was a remarkable woman.

101
00:03:41,287 --> 00:03:44,791
Brilliant, playful...
and passionate.

102
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:46,626
I adored her.

103
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:47,794
FRASIER:
Here we are.

104
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:50,129
Welcome back to Seattle.

105
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:51,130
Thank you.

106
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:52,632
There we are.

107
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:54,634
(chuckles)

108
00:03:56,636 --> 00:03:57,637
(sighs)

109
00:03:57,637 --> 00:03:58,638
This sherry
is exquisite.

110
00:03:59,138 --> 00:04:00,139
Oh, thank you.

111
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,575
It's an Andalusian Amontilla
do I'm rather fond of.

112
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,510
A connoisseur.
I am very surprised.

113
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,913
Most Americans think that sherry
is just for cooking.

114
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,848
Oh, my brother and I have
always had a taste for it.

115
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:10,350
Well, you didn't get that from me.

116
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:11,851
I've always hated the stuff.

117
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:14,187
You know, come to think of it,
so did your mom.

118
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,169
Can I help you?

119
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:31,271
I'm sorry about that.

120
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:31,971
Eddie, down.

121
00:04:37,343 --> 00:04:40,613
Wh-Why is he doing that?

122
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:41,881
I don't really know.

123
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:43,883
He used to do it to me, but,
uh... I tell you what,

124
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:46,386
just don't get
in a staring contest with him.

125
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:47,287
That's what he wants.

126
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,055
MARTIN:
Come on, Eddie, get down.

127
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:51,024
I'm sorry. I don't know
what got into him.

128
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:52,358
I'll get him a treat.

129
00:04:52,358 --> 00:04:53,693
Frasier, this is remarkable.

130
00:04:54,193 --> 00:04:56,529
You and I seem to have
the same taste in art.

131
00:04:56,529 --> 00:04:58,731
Rauschenberg, Otterson

132
00:04:58,731 --> 00:05:01,034
African statuary and sculpture.

133
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:02,535
Although I...

134
00:05:02,535 --> 00:05:04,871
I must confess,
I'm not familiar with that one

135
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:07,206
Oh, that's because
while most Azande statues

136
00:05:07,206 --> 00:05:09,208
are intended
to ward off evil spirits,

137
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:10,710
this one was designed
to distract me

138
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:13,713
while my pockets were picked
at the Kinshasa Airport.

139
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:16,082
(laughing)

140
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,221
You two have a lot in common.

141
00:05:22,221 --> 00:05:25,058
Psychiatry and sherry and art...

142
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,893
And furniture.

143
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:29,362
That is a Coco Chanel sofa,

144
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:30,363
unless I'm mistaken.

145
00:05:30,863 --> 00:05:31,798
It is an exact

146
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:33,366
replica of the one
in her Paris atelier.

147
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:35,201
You know, not many people even notice it.

148
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:37,537
Well, not many people
have passed out drunk

149
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:38,905
on the original.

150
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,407
Oh, I would love
to hear that story.

151
00:05:41,407 --> 00:05:42,842
Well, you are in luck,

152
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:44,677
because I love
to tell it.

153
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,846
But first,
let me thank you

154
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:48,614
for making me feel
so welcome.

155
00:05:48,614 --> 00:05:50,616
I must confess,
I had some reservations

156
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:52,618
about returning to Seattle.

157
00:05:52,618 --> 00:05:54,120
But you have
dispelled them all.

158
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,121
To you.

159
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:56,122
Ah...

160
00:05:57,623 --> 00:05:59,092
Mmm.
Mmm. Please.

161
00:06:05,598 --> 00:06:07,600
Mmm.
Mmm.

162
00:06:21,614 --> 00:06:23,182
What's the matter?

163
00:06:23,182 --> 00:06:24,484
Nothing.

164
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:33,326
NILES:
Okay, we just need

165
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:35,828
to fill in a name

166
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:38,331
and I can get the application
over to St. Osric's.

167
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:39,832
How can we have a name?

168
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:41,100
I'm not even pregnant yet.

169
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,368
You know, it's not the name.

170
00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:43,236
It's just a placeholder.

171
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:44,637
Anything will do.

172
00:06:44,637 --> 00:06:47,940
Mm, all right,
how about, uh... Simon?

173
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:51,577
As in your-brother-with-the-
substance-abuse-problem Simon?

174
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:54,981
There are other Simons,
you know.

175
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:58,985
Simon Templar, Simon Legree,
Simon Chipmunk.

176
00:06:58,985 --> 00:07:01,988
You're not exactly
building a case for Simon.

177
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:02,989
Um, how about Jill?

178
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:04,457
No, don't like it.

179
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:07,760
That's the name of that
weather tart on channel eight.

180
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,562
All right, let's just
pick a name at random.

181
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:10,997
Oh, like, out of the phone book.

182
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:11,998
Oh, that's
a good idea,

183
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:13,499
and leave it to fate.

184
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:14,834
Okay...

185
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:17,170
When I stop, you point.

186
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:23,142
"Bob."
Great.

187
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,482
Bob...

188
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:31,350
Crane. Okay.

189
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:35,121
Going to need some whiteout.

190
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:39,892
LELAND:
Oh, listen to me,

191
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:41,861
I've been talking your ears off for the past hour

192
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:42,862
about psychiatry.

193
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:43,863
MARTIN:
Yeah, really.

194
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:46,365
Oh, Roz, do you mind
if we join you?

195
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:47,366
Oh, yeah, not at all.

196
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:48,668
Hi, Roz.

197
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:50,369
Leland, it is
such a pleasure

198
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:53,372
to talk shop
with a fellow nutcracker.

199
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:54,941
And talking to you "Jung" people

200
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:56,943
makes me feel like an "id" again.

201
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:58,411
(laughing)

202
00:07:58,411 --> 00:07:59,846
Do you have a pun,
Frasier?

203
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:02,114
Uh, no.
Let's just sit down, huh?

204
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:11,791
What's wrong?

205
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:12,792
Nothing.

206
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:14,193
Oh, you know,
there is

207
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:16,062
a wonderful Brassai exhibit
in town.

208
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:17,897
What do you say we
stop over there after lunch?

209
00:08:17,897 --> 00:08:18,731
I would love that.

210
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:19,732
I'm a big fan.

211
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:21,234
Oh, I wish
I could join you.

212
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:22,568
I have patients
all afternoon.

213
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:24,804
Don't suppose you'd be willing to go now would you?

214
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,540
Fine by me
Certainly.
Let's get coffee at the museum

215
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:31,344
Dad, Roz, any chance
you'd like to take in some

216
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:34,146
Parisian photos by
 an old Romanian master?

217
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,549
Mmmm... no

218
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:38,417
Thanks anyway.

219
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:39,252
Okay..

220
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:40,586
Oh, excuse me.

221
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,488
Your father forgot
his umbrella.

222
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:44,991
Oh, thank you.
Thank you very much.

223
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:46,492
Here you go... "Dad."

224
00:08:46,492 --> 00:08:48,494
(all chuckling)

225
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:51,430
Well, I don't blame him for that.

226
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:53,499
Leland's more
like him than I am.

227
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:55,001
Really?
You really think so?

228
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:57,003
Oh, come on, how can
you not see it?

229
00:08:57,003 --> 00:09:00,306
They're like three
fancy peas in a pod.

230
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:01,607
Well, I did notice
that they have

231
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:03,109
the same taste
in art and music,

232
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:05,611
and they even have
some of the same mannerisms.

233
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:06,445
Yeah.

234
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:09,415
And Leland and Niles
are both allergic

235
00:09:09,415 --> 00:09:11,918
to rosehips
and Jerusalem artichokes.

236
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:13,286
Weird, huh?

237
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:15,321
When Leland was talking
to me last night

238
00:09:15,821 --> 00:09:17,323
about how close
he and Hester were,

239
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:19,225
I started thinking
what you're thinking.

240
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:25,431
And what am I thinking?

241
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:27,733
Nothing.

242
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,936
What are you saying?
You think he's their father?

243
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,637
No, I wasn't saying that

244
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:34,473
Well, lots of people like art and sherry and-and...

245
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:35,474
French stuff.

246
00:09:35,474 --> 00:09:37,243
It doesn't mean they're related.

247
00:09:37,476 --> 00:09:41,447
By your logic, everyone on the
cooking channel is their father.

248
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:44,150
Okay.
Okay

249
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:47,954
Ugh! what the hell is this?

250
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:48,955
I don't know.

251
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:50,957
It was there
when I sat down.

252
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:53,960
Ew!

253
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:59,465
Leland, your autobiography is wonderful.

254
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:00,967
Thank you.

255
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:02,969
Let us hope that
the publishing houses
feel similarly.

256
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:04,403
Ah. Have you shown it to Frasier?

257
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,339
No, I haven't.
How's he feeling, by the way?

258
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:07,340
Let's go see.
Right.

259
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,841
(cell phone rings)

260
00:10:08,841 --> 00:10:10,176
Yeah, bring the
manuscript; he'd love to see it.

261
00:10:10,576 --> 00:10:12,078
Hello.

262
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:13,012
Oh, hello, darling.

263
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:14,447
Go ahead, I'll be right there.

264
00:10:14,847 --> 00:10:18,684
Okay, so Delilah's out.

265
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:20,653
No, no, that's fine,
that's fine.

266
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:22,188
What are your ideas?

267
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:23,189
Taylor, uh-huh.

268
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:25,691
Fletcher.

269
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:27,693
Cooper.

270
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:29,695
Tanner.

271
00:10:29,695 --> 00:10:31,697
Where are you getting these,

272
00:10:31,697 --> 00:10:34,700
The Big Book
of Medieval Professions?

273
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:38,004
Frasier, how you doing?

274
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:40,339
Oh, I'm afraid my stomach is still churning.

275
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:42,608
I-I'm not going to be able to make dinner.

276
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:43,876
Oh, I understand.

277
00:10:43,876 --> 00:10:44,877
Well, I'll leave you to rest

278
00:10:44,877 --> 00:10:46,879
Perhaps though, later,
if you're feeling better

279
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:47,880
I can get your opinion

280
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,715
on a short section
of my autobiography.

281
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:53,052
Well, when I can't give
an opinion, you may as well

282
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:55,488
call the coroner, tag my toe,
I'm dead.

283
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:58,290
(laughing)

284
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:00,693
No, that's a kind of car

285
00:11:03,195 --> 00:11:04,196
Hey, Niles.
Hey.

286
00:11:04,196 --> 00:11:05,131
What's going on?

287
00:11:05,464 --> 00:11:08,034
Oh, we were going to go out
to dinner with Leland,

288
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:10,036
but Frasier's
not feeling well.

289
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:11,937
Oh, well, maybe
I'll go check on him.

290
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,907
Now it just sounds like you're reading from the spice rack.

291
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:20,579
"I realized the Sherpa
had become my guide

292
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:22,581
in more ways than one."

293
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:24,083
Oh, that was wonderful.

294
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:25,985
Read me another.

295
00:11:26,318 --> 00:11:27,820
Oh, no,
you go to sleep now.

296
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:29,989
Oh, Dad.

297
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:31,257
Hey, Fras. Just, uh,

298
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:33,759
was wondering
how you were feeling.

299
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,761
Oh, well,
not so good actually.

300
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:39,265
I'm afraid I'm going
to have to skip dinner.

301
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:41,267
Why don't you go
in my place?

302
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:42,635
Sure, if you
want me to.
All right.

303
00:11:42,935 --> 00:11:44,470
You know, the two of you
should get going

304
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:45,838
or you'll miss the reservation

305
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:47,440
Right. Well, get well, son.

306
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,308
We'll be wishing you
a speedy recovery. Mm?

307
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:50,643
Oh, thank you.

308
00:11:51,944 --> 00:11:52,945
Oh, Fras, you want me

309
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:55,981
to bring you something back
from the restaurant?

310
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:58,384
Maybe some Jell-O
to soothe your tummy?

311
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:00,286
Thanks, Dad,
it's all taken care of.

312
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:03,222
Leland is going to bring me
some consomm￩ and sorbet.

313
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:05,624
Oh.

314
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,960
Okay.

315
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:09,361
Well, Niles, it looks like

316
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:12,298
your dad is going to take Frasier's place at dinner.

317
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:14,366
Oh, excellent.

318
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:15,868
Oh!

319
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:16,769
What's the matter?

320
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:18,471
My leg's asleep.

321
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:19,638
Ooh, move your foot around.

322
00:12:19,638 --> 00:12:21,640
No, no, it's the whole leg.
I'll just wait it out.

323
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:23,642
But the movement will get the blood flowing.

324
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:26,145
Go ahead, give it a try.
No, can't put
weight on it.

325
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:27,480
Sure you can. Give it a try.

326
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,315
Come on, one step
at a time, come on

327
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:31,817
There you go. That a boy

328
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:34,320
That a boy. Keep going

329
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,654
There you are, good.

330
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:43,662
Hey, Roz.
Hey, Martin.

331
00:12:43,662 --> 00:12:45,664
If you're looking for
Frasier, he just left.

332
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:47,666
Well, thanks, but actually,
I was looking for you.

333
00:12:47,666 --> 00:12:49,635
I could use
a little advice.

334
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:51,504
From me? Really?

335
00:12:51,837 --> 00:12:53,906
Well, if it stinks,
I can always ignore it.

336
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,908
Okay, that's a plan. Come on in.

337
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:57,243
I'm just finishing up.

338
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:01,113
What do you need?

339
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:03,516
Uh, it's the Leland thing.

340
00:13:03,849 --> 00:13:06,919
I mean, even though
I know it's not possible

341
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:09,922
that he's Frasier
and Niles' father,

342
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:13,192
I guess what's bugging me
is, technically, it is possible.

343
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:15,928
Well, sure,
it's possible,
technically.

344
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:17,830
Martin, do you really think

345
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:21,133
your wife would have
ever cheated on you?

346
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:24,970
She did.

347
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,872
She said it happened once.

348
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:29,308
Oh, my God.

349
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:30,709
With Leland?

350
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:33,045
No. With someone else.

351
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:36,982
I think that you're
driving yourself crazy
for nothing here.

352
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:39,485
Of course Frasier and
Niles are your sons.

353
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:41,320
You're exactly
like them.

354
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:42,621
"Like"? How?

355
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:45,457
A strong sense of ethics.

356
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:49,895
Yeah. We are ethical.

357
00:13:49,895 --> 00:13:51,163
What else?

358
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:53,399
The way they spin out
of control.

359
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:55,835
Hmm. That's true.

360
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,770
They got that from me.

361
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,205
Their stubbornness.
I'm not stubborn.

362
00:13:59,705 --> 00:14:00,206
Their defensiveness.

363
00:14:00,706 --> 00:14:01,707
What's that
supposed to mean?

364
00:14:01,707 --> 00:14:03,209
The way they completely
dismiss anyone

365
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:04,210
who doesn't share
their opinion.

366
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:07,179
Oh, now you're just
being dumb.

367
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:10,216
Hey, what is the
worst-case scenario?

368
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:12,718
If you found out you
weren't their father,

369
00:14:12,718 --> 00:14:14,220
would you love
them any less?

370
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,988
No, no.

371
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:20,759
Well, yeah, a little, maybe,
at first, but no.

372
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:24,563
I'd feel the same about them as I hope they would about me.

373
00:14:24,563 --> 00:14:28,234
Which they would,
and you know that.

374
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:29,668
Yeah.

375
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:32,671
I mean, you'd still love Alice if you'd found out

376
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:35,507
you'd gotten the wrong baby at the hospital.

377
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:36,375
Sure.

378
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,877
(both chuckle)

379
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,379
And as a cop,
I've seen that happen

380
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:41,881
more often than
you'd think.

381
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,382
Especially at
Seattle General.

382
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,384
I had Alice
at Seattle General.

383
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:47,853
Oh. Sorry.

384
00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:50,289
But the point was that
you'd love her just the same

385
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:52,191
so who cares
who her real mother is.

386
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:54,059
I'm her real mother!

387
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:55,561
Okay, geez.

388
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:57,997
How about Desmond?

389
00:14:57,997 --> 00:14:59,031
Desmond Crane.

390
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:02,067
Desmond Crane, you are
hereby sentenced to...

391
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:04,570
No, I don't like it.

392
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,971
What about Jack?

393
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:08,374
Afraid not.

394
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:10,376
The first name ends
with the same sound

395
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:11,377
that begins the last name.

396
00:15:11,877 --> 00:15:13,879
So you either end up
running them together

397
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:16,382
Jack Crane, or you face
the dreaded glottal stop.

398
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:19,818
Jack Crane. Jack Crane.

399
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,722
It's unpleasant
for the throat.

400
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:26,225
This conversation's
unpleasant for the throat.

401
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:27,726
Well, I know, I know.

402
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:31,730
Okay. Oh... why don't we use
the name of that nice nurse

403
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:33,165
from when I was
in the hospital?

404
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:36,602
Fong or Deshondra?

405
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:40,039
Fong.

406
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,442
Wait. Let's not
drive ourselves
crazy about this.

407
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:45,477
It's a temporary name
for a hypothetical child.

408
00:15:45,477 --> 00:15:48,447
Yes, but once you give something
a name, it makes it more real,

409
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:50,916
and then that name will always
have a sort of priority.

410
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:53,185
I don't care
how often you say

411
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:55,454
"elevator" or "apartment"
or "crossing guard,"

412
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,957
to me they'll always be
"lifts" and "flats"

413
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,458
and "lollipop men."

414
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:02,461
Well, then, tell you what,
you pick a name

415
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,897
and I'll accept it
unconditionally.

416
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:07,132
Milton.

417
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:11,303
Milton. Great poet
and a great name.

418
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:12,304
Great.

419
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:13,305
Can we go to bed now?

420
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:14,807
Yes.

421
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,312
Hey, didn't you have

422
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,815
a soccer hooligan
boyfriend named Milton?

423
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,817
Yeah, that's where
I got it.

My boys and me, yeah.
We're wonderful

438
00:17:20,472 --> 00:17:22,741
and we're musical.

439
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,109
Martin, I can't tell you

440
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:25,511
what a wonderful job
you've done with them.

441
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:26,879
Oh, it's wasn't a job.

442
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:29,381
It was a biological
pleasure.

443
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:31,383
And don't forget,
I had Hester.

444
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:32,885
(phone rings)
Oh, excuse me.

445
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,386
You were lucky.

446
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:35,387
She was a splendid woman

447
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:36,889
and a remarkable
research partner.

448
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:39,224
And an even better
life partner.

449
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:41,560
Well, I wouldn't know
about that.

450
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,529
Damn straight you wouldn't

451
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:46,331
Leland, your cab is waiting.

452
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:48,667
Oh, so soon?

453
00:17:49,034 --> 00:17:53,038
Well, I can't thank you enough for all your courtesies.

454
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:55,407
Bless you.
If you are ever in Paris,

455
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:58,277
you must allow me
to repay your many kindnesses.

456
00:17:58,277 --> 00:17:59,645
Oh, thank you
so much.

457
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:01,647
I'm so proud of the way
you boys have turned out.

458
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:03,148
Leland, let me
walk you out.

459
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:04,583
Thank you.

460
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:05,617
NILES:
Bon voyage.

461
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:19,431
Leland, there's a question
I need to ask you.

462
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:21,233
Oh, yes, of course.
Anything.

463
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:25,571
I'm a little uncomfortable even bringing it up,

464
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:27,573
but I don't think I could let you leave the country

465
00:18:28,073 --> 00:18:29,475
without knowing the answer.

466
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:36,748
I know that you and my wife
spent a lot of time together,

467
00:18:37,082 --> 00:18:38,617
that you were close.

468
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:42,521
I loved her very much.

469
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:47,826
And I guess my question is,
how much?

470
00:18:47,826 --> 00:18:52,264
Enough to...

471
00:18:52,764 --> 00:18:55,067
trust her with the fact
that I'm gay.

472
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:59,271
Oh!

473
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:02,174
40 years ago,
people weren't as accepting

474
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:03,675
as they are nowadays,

475
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:06,979
and without someone like her
to confide in...

476
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:09,815
She quite probably
saved my life.

477
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:23,228
Leland, she loved you, too.

478
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:26,932
She really was something,
wasn't she?

479
00:19:27,132 --> 00:19:29,001
Oh, she really was.

480
00:19:30,802 --> 00:19:31,803
Bye, Martin.

481
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:33,305
Take care, Leland.

482
00:19:33,805 --> 00:19:34,806
Thank you.
