1
00:00:09,042 --> 00:00:09,976
Well, it's official.

2
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,979
Once again, there is no room for me

3
00:00:12,979 --> 00:00:15,482
at the Yo-Yo Ma
Orchestral Fantasy Camp.

4
00:00:15,482 --> 00:00:17,417
Hello.

5
00:00:17,817 --> 00:00:20,387
Frasier, this is
my cousin, Jen.

6
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:21,388
She's visiting
this week, remember?

7
00:00:21,388 --> 00:00:22,589
Oh, yes.

8
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:23,923
Of course. So, how are you
enjoying Seattle?

9
00:00:24,424 --> 00:00:25,191
Well...

10
00:00:25,392 --> 00:00:26,960
I've been
living in London,

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,962
so Seattle seems
a little lame.

12
00:00:28,962 --> 00:00:29,863
No offense.

13
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:31,264
Oh, none taken.

14
00:00:31,264 --> 00:00:32,098
So you like London?

15
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:33,933
Not really.

16
00:00:33,933 --> 00:00:35,835
It's like a parody
of itself.

17
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:37,270
How so?
Oh, you know,

18
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:38,772
double-decker buses...
Ah
...

19
00:00:38,772 --> 00:00:40,774
Bobbies, little pubs...

20
00:00:40,774 --> 00:00:43,276
It's like Epcot,
but even fakier.

21
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,111
So I bailed.

22
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:46,946
Went and spent some
time in Florence.

23
00:00:46,946 --> 00:00:47,781
Ah
...

24
00:00:48,014 --> 00:00:49,582
Firenze.
How is she?

25
00:00:49,582 --> 00:00:50,884
I got to say...

26
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:52,485
Florence is over.

27
00:00:53,953 --> 00:00:55,021
It was probably cool

28
00:00:55,021 --> 00:00:56,923
before all the Americans
found out about it.

29
00:00:57,257 --> 00:00:59,125
You mean 300 years ago?

30
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:00,460
Exactly.

31
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,262
That's why
I'm going to Vietnam.

32
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:05,432
Americans have never
even heard of it.

33
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,300
Ah.
Well, you know, I'm afraid

34
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,802
I have to bail
on this conversation.

35
00:01:09,302 --> 00:01:10,303
I have a show to prepare for.

36
00:01:10,303 --> 00:01:12,272
Uh, Roz, when are we doing
those promos this evening?

37
00:01:12,705 --> 00:01:13,773
Oh, I had
to reschedule those

38
00:01:13,773 --> 00:01:16,209
'cause Jen and I
are going out tonight.

39
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:18,611
A guy I met on the Internet
is in this band.

40
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,480
We're going to go check them
out, have some drinks

41
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:21,981
watch all the losers.

42
00:01:21,981 --> 00:01:23,983
Want to come?

43
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:26,986
While no stranger
to the discotheque

44
00:01:26,986 --> 00:01:29,322
I'm afraid it'll just have to
be you and Roz this evening.

45
00:01:29,622 --> 00:01:31,191
This is our first time going out

46
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:32,692
since I was a kid.

47
00:01:32,692 --> 00:01:34,194
When she used to baby-sit
me

48
00:01:34,194 --> 00:01:36,696
she was always dragging
me on some wild adventure.

49
00:01:36,696 --> 00:01:38,198
Like that time
we changed that sign

50
00:01:38,698 --> 00:01:40,667
from "School Assembly" to "cool ass."

51
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:42,168
Ah
...
(chuckles)

52
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:43,636
Charming.

53
00:01:43,636 --> 00:01:45,038
JEN:
No, you don't understand.

54
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:48,508
The town we grew up in
was totally boring.

55
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:49,943
It was like
Kill Yourself, USA, right?

56
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:54,080
Roz was the only person who did anything fun.

57
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:55,882
Is that so?
Yeah.

58
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,183
My mom calls me Roz Junior

59
00:01:57,684 --> 00:01:59,686
which is what passes for
wit where we come from.

60
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,089
And our town has the world's..

61
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:06,960
...fourth largest
thermometer.
Fourth largest thermometer.

62
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:09,696
Yes, well...

63
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:13,066
I can see why London
really let you down.

64
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:16,436
Hey, Doc.
Hi, Kenny.

65
00:02:16,936 --> 00:02:18,938
Remember last month when
you spent your whole show

66
00:02:18,938 --> 00:02:20,940
talking to that
pregnant teenager?
Yes.

67
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,742
Well, it wasn't
a total waste.

68
00:02:23,042 --> 00:02:24,611
We just got nominated

69
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:27,113
for an Excellence in
Broadcasting Decency award.

70
00:02:27,113 --> 00:02:28,047
Really?

71
00:02:28,515 --> 00:02:30,083
Well, that is quite an honor.

72
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:31,551
I don't think we've ever
won one of those.

73
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:33,520
It's a very
prestigious award.

74
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:37,957
That's what makes it so special when
they call your name.

75
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:40,326
You know, it's heavier
than it looks.

76
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,730
You don't want to drop
one of those

77
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:46,332
So you've won one?
Yeah

78
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,735
It's in a box in my office.
You can come by sometime

79
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:49,669
and I'll show you.
Honestly, Kenny,

80
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:51,604
when are you going to unpack
those boxes?

81
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:53,606
Isn't four years enough time
to make that office your own?

82
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,074
Negatory, Doc.

83
00:02:55,074 --> 00:02:57,510
Every time I unpack
in a new job, I get fired--

84
00:02:57,877 --> 00:02:59,946
Tacoma, Moline...

85
00:02:59,946 --> 00:03:02,448
Moline again.

86
00:03:02,448 --> 00:03:04,751
I learned my lesson.
Those boxes stay packed.

87
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:06,653
So that's why
you haven't unpacked.

88
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:09,155
You know, all this time I
been using you on my radio show

89
00:03:09,155 --> 00:03:11,658
as an example
of procrastination.

90
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:13,459
I had no idea
you were just living in fear.

91
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:17,263
I prefer to see it as
a healthy superstition.

92
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:19,732
Kenny, there's no such thing
as a healthy superstition.

93
00:03:19,732 --> 00:03:20,567
Oh, yeah?

94
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,435
What do you call
washing your hands

95
00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:23,436
after you go to the bathroom?

96
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,045
(sportscast playing)

97
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,046
Ugh.

98
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,814
Look at this place.

99
00:03:35,014 --> 00:03:37,050
Dad, I don't believe you've
thrown out a single newspaper

100
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,551
since Daphne
moved in with Niles.

101
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:40,553
Hey, it was your idea
to split up the chores

102
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,589
Recycling is your deal

103
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:45,391
Recycling and
floors, remember?

104
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:49,229
I'm in charge of regular garbage and tabletops.

105
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:52,232
Both of which are nicely
under control, I might add.

106
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,666
Really?

107
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:55,235
I count three snack plates
around your chair.

108
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,136
All of them on tabletops.

109
00:03:57,503 --> 00:03:58,571
Ah.

110
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:06,679
Not anymore.

111
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,982
All right.

112
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:10,483
What's it going to take for you

113
00:04:10,483 --> 00:04:12,385
to start doing your share
of the work around here?

114
00:04:13,786 --> 00:04:17,624
Trade me... floors for garbage.

115
00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:19,425
You'll really take care
of all the floors

116
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:20,827
if I handle the garbage?

117
00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:21,761
That's right.

118
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,029
(doorbell rings)

119
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:26,766
Okay.

120
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:31,271
Okay.

121
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,773
You got a deal, mister.

122
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:34,774
Hi, Daph.

123
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:35,775
Hello.

124
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:38,278
Why is all your garbage
stacked up in the hallway?

125
00:04:40,713 --> 00:04:43,683
That's right,
why is that, Frasier?

126
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:48,021
Your game is deep.

127
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:50,957
My, things are a bit untidy
around here, aren't they?

128
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,960
Maybe I'll just clean up the
dishes before we get started.

129
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,961
Daphne, you don't
have to do that.

130
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:58,231
That's true, you're not our slave anymore.

131
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:01,000
I'm not going to do all of it.

132
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,435
Just the tabletops.

133
00:05:02,902 --> 00:05:04,971
Oh, that's sweet of you.

134
00:05:09,575 --> 00:05:12,011
Burn.

135
00:05:15,848 --> 00:05:16,883
No, no...

136
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:18,685
Well, there's room
at Roz's table.

137
00:05:18,951 --> 00:05:19,986
No.

138
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,021
Jen
I find her cousin

139
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:26,025
just a bit judgmental for my tastes.

140
00:05:26,025 --> 00:05:29,028
Yesterday she told me that
my show was bourgeois.

141
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:31,030
I pointed out that anything
that had mass appeal

142
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:33,032
could be called bourgeois.

143
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:35,535
She then said my argument was bourgeois.

144
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:38,037
Which I found to be jejune

145
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:42,008
People in their 20s
are always like that.

146
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,010
Hmm.
The world's so daunting
at that age.

147
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,012
They comfort themselves
with the idea

148
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,008
that everything's just trash.

149
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:49,682
We were like that
in medical school--

150
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:51,684
acting as if we were
above it all...

151
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:54,687
(chuckles)
Smarter than everybody.

152
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:55,621
It passes.

153
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,092
Hello, Roz

154
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:00,526
Niles, Frasier.

155
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:01,594
Hi, Roz.
Come join us.

156
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:02,995
Thank you
Jen, this is Niles.

157
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:04,864
Nice to meet you.

158
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,866
"Niles." Whoa.

159
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:10,236
"Thanks, Mom
and Dad," right?

160
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:11,537
(lightly chuckles)

161
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:12,872
FRASIER:
Well, Jen...

162
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:14,173
good to see you again.

163
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:17,176
Ah, so how was
our night out, girls?

164
00:06:17,176 --> 00:06:20,546
Well, it's
still going on.

165
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:23,783
We went to this really
great club called Zoo.

166
00:06:23,983 --> 00:06:25,051
Excuse me, The Zoo?

167
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,486
No, it was
just called Zoo.

168
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:27,954
And their...
"The."

169
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,390
(laughs)

170
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:34,894
Roz...

171
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,397
is that glitter in your hair?

172
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:38,398
Oh, is it?

173
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:41,234
I thought it all came out
in the car wash.

174
00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:44,537
(cell phone rings)

175
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:45,538
Oh, that's mine.

176
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:46,539
Oh...

177
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:47,440
Hello?

178
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,309
Oh, Anka, you'll never guess

179
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:54,147
what huge Seattle clich￩
I'm in right now.

180
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:58,451
I swear, my cousin Roz is like,
the only cool person

181
00:06:58,451 --> 00:06:59,752
in this whole city.

182
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:01,320
The rest are just drones.

183
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:03,356
Apparently they don't believe in raw sugar.

184
00:07:03,556 --> 00:07:05,625
Excuse me.

185
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:07,427
You see what I mean about her.

186
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,263
She's struggling through
a typical phase of development.

187
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,230
Stop being so sensitive.

188
00:07:11,564 --> 00:07:12,131
Hmm...

189
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:13,599
Sorry about that.

190
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:14,634
Not at all

191
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:16,636
So... tell me about you guys.

192
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:18,538
Roz says
you're super competitive

193
00:07:18,871 --> 00:07:19,939
with each other.
Did your parents

194
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:23,443
withhold affection or is it
just a penis thing?

195
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,946
Uh, I'll take
mine to go, thank you

196
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:32,585
Coming up next...

197
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:35,621
"This Day in
Psychological History,"

198
00:07:36,155 --> 00:07:36,956
after the news.

199
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:37,790
(yawns)

200
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,293
That was a good show,
Frasier.

201
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:43,095
It's not over, Roz.
This is just a break.

202
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:45,965
I'm sorry, I'm so exhausted.

203
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,433
I haven't slept
since Jen got here.

204
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:48,968
Hey, Roz, you want to go

205
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,770
see some backyard
wrestling tonight?

206
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:51,971
ROZ:
I don't know.

207
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,373
Maybe we should stay in tonight
and rent a video.

208
00:07:54,373 --> 00:07:55,842
Rent a video?

209
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:58,811
You're turning into
Aunt Maribelle.

210
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:01,781
All you need is a beanbag
ashtray and a tracheotomy.

211
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:07,487
Well, I'm not there yet.

212
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:10,490
I just thought that maybe
you could use a night off.

213
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,424
Say, Jen

214
00:08:11,757 --> 00:08:12,825
did you have a chance to explore

215
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,327
that art gallery I suggested?

216
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,261
Yeah.

217
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:16,662
I know you're into that stuff

218
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:17,997
so I don't want to put it down

219
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:19,765
But it was like
everything in there

220
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:22,168
was trying to make us
feel better about our corrupt,

221
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:26,005
imperialistic,
phallocratic heritage.

222
00:08:27,306 --> 00:08:28,808
They're landscapes.

223
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:33,980
But I picked up something for you
on the way over here.

224
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:34,947
Really?
Mm-hmm.

225
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:36,482
Well...

226
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:38,284
Oh.

227
00:08:38,484 --> 00:08:41,988
A bust of Freud.

228
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:43,890
Wow, that's really quite thoughtful of you.

229
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:47,693
I figured you'd
appreciate the irony.

230
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:52,732
Since he's been proven wrong
about practically everything.

231
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:54,200
I like to think
that Freud's theories

232
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,235
will stand the test of time.

233
00:08:56,235 --> 00:08:57,069
Really?

234
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,939
Have you read either of his books?

235
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:02,742
Excuse me, young lady...

236
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:05,077
Uh-oh,
here comes the lecture.

237
00:09:05,077 --> 00:09:06,078
Yes.

238
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:08,080
For once,
you are right.

239
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,017
A disquisition
is indeed at hand.

240
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:13,920
And may I suggest
that you roll your eyes

241
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,422
back into the forward
position...

242
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:21,127
...as I may actually employ
some visual aids.

243
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:24,063
Now our story begins
with a young Greek woman

244
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:26,065
by the name of Clytemnestra...

245
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:29,502
Look, everybody,
Kenny's here.

246
00:09:29,835 --> 00:09:32,738
Wow, I've never
heard that before.

247
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:35,875
Jen, maybe Kenny can show you around the station

248
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:38,210
You already showed me around
the station yesterday.

249
00:09:38,644 --> 00:09:39,712
I know, but you know what?

250
00:09:39,712 --> 00:09:41,714
I totally forgot to show you
our ratings binders.

251
00:09:42,214 --> 00:09:43,215
You did?
Yeah.

252
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:44,717
Well, you're in
for a treat.

253
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:46,185
Here, follow me.

254
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:47,587
What's that trophy for?

255
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:50,623
Oh, a little series I produced called

256
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:53,626
"Life Is My Favorite
Drug Of All."

257
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:55,461
Sounds pretty lame.

258
00:09:56,829 --> 00:09:58,264
Yeah, it was.

259
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,602
All right, that girl's really getting under my skin.

260
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:03,970
When is she leaving?

261
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:05,771
She's not that bad.
Oh, come on, Roz.

262
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:07,273
She's running you ragged

263
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:09,275
Oh, please.
This is nothing.

264
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,776
I used to party every night.

265
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:11,777
Well, sure

266
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:13,613
At 20, you can do anything.

267
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:18,250
Hey, there's still a lot
of candy left in this pinata.

268
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:19,952
That's attractive.

269
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:21,520
Thank you.

270
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,022
Oh...

271
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:27,526
And this is my office.

272
00:10:27,526 --> 00:10:30,029
The nerve center.

273
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:32,431
Where it all goes down

274
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:37,236
Did you just move in here
or something?

275
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:39,605
Oh, no, no, but
in AM radio, you got to be

276
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:41,607
ready to go
at a moment's notice.

277
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:42,875
One day you're operating

278
00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:45,144
a 50,000-watt powerhouse
in Cleveland,

279
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,146
the next
you're spinning platters

280
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:49,048
out of a barn in Tulsa town.

281
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:50,850
But you got to keep moving

282
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:54,286
It's all about the music

283
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:57,556
When it isn't about news
and talk.

284
00:10:57,757 --> 00:10:59,158
I heard AM radio's dead.

285
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:00,493
Yeah, it is.

286
00:11:00,926 --> 00:11:03,496
So you're going to Vietnam?

287
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,498
I'm thinking about it.

288
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:06,899
.
That's such an original choice

289
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:08,734
You're so cool.

290
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:10,803
ly
You're the first person who hasn't
thought I was total

291
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:12,238
crazy for wanting
to go there.
Oh

292
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:13,639
What do they know?

293
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:15,641
I've always loved the
idea of just taking off.

294
00:11:15,641 --> 00:11:17,576
You know, seeing someplace exotic.

295
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:18,911
Why haven't you?

296
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:21,113
My wife,
she didn't like to travel.

297
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,882
But you just said
you were separated.

298
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:24,617
So do it.

299
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:27,386
Blow it all off, go see Vietnam.

300
00:11:27,386 --> 00:11:29,789
Break out of this prison cell.

301
00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:32,692
I could, couldn't I?

302
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,193
You know,
and I could just be free.

303
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,696
Get a motorcycle, drive around the countryside

304
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:37,997
and really start to live.

305
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:40,332
I never even thought
about the motorcycle.

306
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:41,767
Now you have to do it.

307
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:45,171
People would think I was nuts.

308
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,106
I wouldn't.

309
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:53,946
...when Freud's genius
has obviously influenced

310
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:57,249
every psychiatrist
on the planet.

311
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:04,056
I haven't forgotten
about your calls.

312
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,559
Stay tuned, won't you?

313
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:12,565
I'm starting to feel
a little bad

314
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:15,000
about pawning Jen off
on Kenny like that.

315
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:16,902
He's been a little down lately

316
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:20,873
And Jen can be a little...
well, negative sometimes.

317
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:25,311
I hadn't noticed.

318
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:27,747
I just hope she doesn't
send him spiraling down

319
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:30,583
into some kind
of depression.

320
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:36,889
(pants)

321
00:12:42,294 --> 00:12:46,165
So Seattle still
loves the Walkman, huh?

322
00:12:46,365 --> 00:12:48,768
He's probably listening
to Thriller.

323
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:50,102
So, do you still
want to go

324
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:51,971
to that warehouse
party tonight?

325
00:12:52,238 --> 00:12:53,305
Doors open at 11:00

326
00:12:53,305 --> 00:12:54,707
so we should probably
be there at 1:00.

327
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,609
Look, I wish I could, Jen.

328
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,410
But I really have to sleep.

329
00:12:58,644 --> 00:13:00,212
Don't worry.

330
00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:01,714
.
We'll have a few cocktails
and you'll feel a lot better

331
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:03,015
Forget it.

332
00:13:03,215 --> 00:13:04,583
I am not drinking again tonight.

333
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:06,252
So, just drink beer.

334
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:07,920
I mean...

335
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:09,822
Alice is still at her
grandparents', right?

336
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:12,625
Listen, sweetie,
why don't you go out by yourself tonight?

337
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:14,760
Oh, come on, Maribelle.
Have some fun.

338
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,861
Don't do that.

339
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:17,062
Do what, Maribelle?

340
00:13:17,396 --> 00:13:19,231
Knock it off.
I'm serious.

341
00:13:19,431 --> 00:13:20,499
You used to be so fun.

342
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:23,002
But ever since you got
the condo and the SUV

343
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:25,337
it's like you're all
401K or whatever.

344
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:27,673
I'm exactly the same person I've always been.

345
00:13:27,673 --> 00:13:28,507
Oh, yeah?

346
00:13:28,774 --> 00:13:29,842
I checked your car radio.

347
00:13:29,842 --> 00:13:32,178
It's not stuck on
that classic rock station.

348
00:13:32,444 --> 00:13:33,512
For your information

349
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:36,949
classic rock is both classic,
and it rocks.

350
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:39,685
What happened to you?

351
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:41,520
I'm old.

352
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:47,993
(doorbell ringing)

353
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:50,396
Daphne, would you
get that?

354
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:54,266
Hello.

355
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,769
Sorry I'm late.
I...

356
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:58,070
What's going on?

357
00:13:58,304 --> 00:13:59,638
Uh-oh.

358
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:02,908
Steady.

359
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:05,377
Your father and brother
needed a little help.

360
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:06,879
The oven's all clean.

361
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:08,881
I just have a bit
of ironing left.

362
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:09,882
I won't be a minute.

363
00:14:10,382 --> 00:14:12,651
And don't forget, I've drawn
baths for both of you.

364
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:14,920
Oh, Daphne, that wasn't
necessary...
Oh, no
 You shouldn't have...

365
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,971
Are you proud
of yourselves?

366
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:35,474
We didn't ask her
to do anything.

367
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:36,842
She offered.

368
00:14:37,142 --> 00:14:40,145
Then why is no one
looking me in the eye?

369
00:14:40,512 --> 00:14:41,580
I'm sorry, Niles.

370
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,082
You're right.
Maybe we took advantage.

371
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:43,883
.
MARTIN
: Absolutely

372
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:45,117
We were way out of line.

373
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:46,418
It won't happen again.

374
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:52,191
What are you doing?

375
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:53,425
What?

376
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:54,727
You're going to leave
that there?

377
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:55,728
I'll clean
it later.

378
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:57,229
Well, that's
the whole problem.

379
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:58,731
If you would just
clean as you go

380
00:14:58,731 --> 00:14:59,732
things wouldn't
pile up.

381
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:01,233
You wouldn't need
Daphne's help.

382
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:02,234
I guess.

383
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:03,235
No, it's true.

384
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:04,236
Look at this.

385
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:05,838
Look how easy, you see?

386
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:09,909
s.
Small, consistent efforts, that's all it take

387
00:15:10,342 --> 00:15:12,745
Just like managing
one's cuticles.

388
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,081
You know, there's a bowl of potato salad

389
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:18,050
lying out completely uncovered.

390
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,519
It's getting tangy.

391
00:15:21,887 --> 00:15:24,723
The plastic wrap is right here.

392
00:15:24,957 --> 00:15:25,958
We really should help him.

393
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:27,459
(under breath):
Are you nuts?

394
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:29,495
.
He's about to make us dinner

395
00:15:32,364 --> 00:15:33,866
He is not.

396
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:35,267
20 bucks says he is.

397
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:37,269
Forget money.
Let's wager something real

398
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:38,103
All right.

399
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:39,438
If I get him to make dinner

400
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:40,940
you do all the chores.

401
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,274
If I don't, I'll do them.

402
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:44,076
I'm ready, Niles.

403
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:47,046
Excellent.
Because tonight I am taking you

404
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:49,481
to the finest bistro in
the Pacific Northwest.

405
00:15:49,915 --> 00:15:50,316
You're on.

406
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:51,317
Take your sweet time,

407
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:52,751
why don't you?
Hey, guys!

408
00:15:52,751 --> 00:15:53,786
Are you sure you don't
want to stick around?

409
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:56,288
I was just gonna open
a can of spaghetti.

410
00:15:58,557 --> 00:16:01,360
But you have
sea bass in the fridge.

411
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,195
Oh, it'll probably last
another day.

412
00:16:03,595 --> 00:16:05,030
Oh, I think you should
cook it tonight.

413
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:06,365
Fine.

414
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:08,867
I'll nuke it with some ketchup

415
00:16:12,938 --> 00:16:14,006
That's ridiculous.

416
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:17,509
You can't use your
turkey recipe on fish.

417
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,745
What am I supposed to do?

418
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:22,014
Well, just take
one clove of garlic,

419
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:24,016
two tablespoons of finely minced

420
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:26,352
fresh ginger...

421
00:16:26,618 --> 00:16:30,189
Oh, for heaven's sake,
I'll do it myself.

422
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:32,691
I suppose I'll lay the table

423
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:34,193
No, no, Daphne.

424
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:36,195
.
You've done enough for today

425
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:37,629
That's Frasier's job.

426
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:48,741
FRASIER:
And so for our final hour today

427
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:51,076
I'd like to focus my attention on
first-time callers only.

428
00:16:51,377 --> 00:16:52,244
Hey.

429
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:53,545
We've been hearing from a lot
Hey!

430
00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:56,048
of familiar voices this week,
and I'd like to shake it up.

431
00:16:56,048 --> 00:16:58,050
I looked for you at
that warehouse party last night,

432
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:59,385
but I didn't see you.
Oh!

433
00:16:59,651 --> 00:17:01,653
I was in the old meat locker.

434
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:05,924
Oh, I didn't look in there

435
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:07,593
Sorry we didn't hook up.

436
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,528
Did I leave my sunglasses in here?

437
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:10,963
Oh, yes, you did.

438
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,533
So, I'm taking off.

439
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,035
I had a really cool time with you.

440
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,037
I hope you make your break from here soon.

441
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:19,338
Good news.

442
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,106
I just got off the phone
with my travel agent.

443
00:17:21,106 --> 00:17:22,574
She got me this great fare
to Ho Chi Minh City

444
00:17:23,108 --> 00:17:25,411
and she said it would be no problem to get you
on the same flight.

445
00:17:25,677 --> 00:17:26,678
This is going to be awesome.

446
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,614
I've never seen Asia before.

447
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:30,115
I've see the band,
of course...

448
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:31,617
but not... you know.

449
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,119
Oh, well, about that, Kenny-- um...

450
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:36,088
I already booked a flight.

451
00:17:36,488 --> 00:17:38,057
Oh, well, maybe I can get
on your flight.

452
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:41,994
Well, see, the thing is
is I, um... I travel solo.

453
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:43,929
Oh.
It's kind of

454
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:45,397
a rule I have. I...

455
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:48,500
Oh, no, plea

456
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,003
I totally get where you're
coming from.

457
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:52,905
Solo's the way to go.

458
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:54,273
My high school French club

459
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:55,774
went to Montreal one time.

460
00:17:55,774 --> 00:17:57,276
Nightmare.

461
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:58,777
Well, you should still go.

462
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:00,779
You deserve to have some fun.

463
00:18:01,213 --> 00:18:02,781
Okay.

464
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:04,283
Yeah.

465
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:09,121
Well, uh, maybe I'll
run into you over there.

466
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:10,422
I'd like that.

467
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:25,270
FRASIER:
Our next caller is Stu
from Madrona.

468
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,773
Go ahead, Stu, I'm listening
.

469
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,608
STU:
All right, it's like this.
..

470
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:31,944
I've been dating my girlfriend for six years,

471
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:33,946
and she keeps bugging me
about moving in.

472
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:37,249
But I know as soon as she does,
my freedom is gone.

473
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:39,084
Everything's got to be
in the hamper.

474
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:40,385
I can't eat over the sink.

475
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:43,155
Can't just go out whenever my buddies call.

476
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:44,156
That's a lot to give up.

477
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:46,158
Okay, Stu, how old are you?

478
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:50,496
The calendar says 47,
but I feel 18, right?

479
00:18:50,762 --> 00:18:53,165
Forty-seven?!

480
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:53,999
Now, Roz...

481
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,934
I have a suggestion for you, Stu.

482
00:18:56,335 --> 00:18:56,902
Grow the hell up!

483
00:18:57,402 --> 00:18:58,203
What?

484
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:00,873
I-I-I'm sorry?
I mean

485
00:19:01,173 --> 00:19:03,742
I'm 38, and I feel 38.

486
00:19:03,742 --> 00:19:05,744
Now I know we're all supposed to act

487
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:07,746
like perpetual teenagers these days.

488
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:09,748
But you know what?
I like acting my age.

489
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:11,250
I like being a mom.

490
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,185
I like having a career.

491
00:19:13,585 --> 00:19:15,120
And I like balancing
my checkbook.

492
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:18,090
When did it become such a bad thing
to be an adult?

493
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:19,791
Dr. Crane, hello?

494
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:22,327
Look, don't get me wrong.

495
00:19:22,761 --> 00:19:25,330
I had a great time
when I was younger. I did.

496
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,833
But after a while,
that way of life

497
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:31,803
just seems... empty.

498
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,274
And you have to go deeper

499
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:40,646
and commit to things
that really matter to you.

500
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:43,582
Believe me, when you do that

501
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:48,487
you'll find out how amazing and rich life can be.

502
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,389
Hey, I know that voice.

503
00:19:50,889 --> 00:19:53,258
You were at Zoo the other night.

504
00:19:57,629 --> 00:20:00,132
You told me you were 29.

505
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:04,069
Thanks for your call, Stu.

506
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:06,071
Let's go to traffic.

507
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:13,178
.
I'm sorry, Frasier

508
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:15,714
I guess I shouldn't have
unloaded on that guy.

509
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:18,083
I've just been thinking
a lot about age lately.

510
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:19,451
That's all right, Roz.

511
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:21,954
I thought your speech
was courageous.

512
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:24,456
And who knows?
Even if it went right past Stu,

513
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:25,924
maybe it reached somebody else

514
00:20:25,924 --> 00:20:29,361
out there on the Frasier Crane
Radio Network.

515

of a jackknifed...
