1
00:00:08,074 --> 00:00:09,009
So, what's the plan?

2
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:10,577
Are we going to
turn off the lights

3
00:00:10,577 --> 00:00:12,078
and jump out
and yell surprise?

4
00:00:12,579 --> 00:00:13,580
Oh, yes, Roz.

5
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:16,416
Let's startle a man who
just had open-heart surgery.

6
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:19,753
Sorry. I can't get used
to thinking of Niles as sick.

7
00:00:19,753 --> 00:00:20,754
Oh, Niles is great.

8
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:22,255
All these exercises he's doing

9
00:00:22,255 --> 00:00:24,691
he's going to be just as strong
as he ever was.

10
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:26,626
Here's the guest of honor.

11
00:00:26,626 --> 00:00:30,530
Niles, good to see you out and about.

12
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:31,498
You look great!

13
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:32,966
Thank you. Thank you.

14
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:34,467
I'll tell you
it's good to be out

15
00:00:34,968 --> 00:00:35,535
after being cooped up

16
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:37,370
in that apartment all week.
Hello.

17
00:00:37,604 --> 00:00:40,140
I never thought I'd grow tired of reading Flaubert.

18
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,141
Oh, please.

19
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:42,675
He's been parked on his ass

20
00:00:42,675 --> 00:00:44,177
watching The Young
and The Restless.

21
00:00:44,177 --> 00:00:45,078
FRASIER:
Niles!

22
00:00:45,078 --> 00:00:45,945
Not the soaps!

23
00:00:45,945 --> 00:00:47,313
You can't be serious.

24
00:00:47,313 --> 00:00:49,082
Well, I'm hardly hooked.

25
00:00:49,082 --> 00:00:50,984
They fascinate me as cultural artifact.

26
00:00:50,984 --> 00:00:52,886
I was just telling Gertrude.

27
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:55,321
Their use of stock figures is reminiscent

28
00:00:55,321 --> 00:00:56,823
of thecommedia dell'arte.

29
00:00:56,823 --> 00:00:59,325
Esther is Punchinell
o, Victor is Flavio

30
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:03,263
and Nicki, well, she's just the town pump.

31
00:01:04,998 --> 00:01:07,567
Now do you see why
I need my own telly, Daphne?

32
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:09,569
You have your
own telly in Manchester.

33
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,037
(uneasy laughter)

34
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:13,406
Here's champagne and sparkling
cider for you Niles

35
00:01:13,773 --> 00:01:15,742
and help yourself to brunch
whenever you're ready.

36
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:18,144
Word to the wise:
Stay away from the sausage.

37
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:19,646
They're not sausages, Dad.

38
00:01:19,646 --> 00:01:21,581
They're soysages.

39
00:01:21,948 --> 00:01:24,017
Niles is on
a postoperative diet.

40
00:01:24,517 --> 00:01:25,885
We are trying
to support him.

41
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:27,554
Oh, sorry. What about the bacon?

42
00:01:27,787 --> 00:01:29,856
Fake-un.

43
00:01:31,825 --> 00:01:34,861
Hey, everyone,
I'd like to propose a toast.

44
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:36,830
To my family and friends:

45
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:39,799
Your love and support
have been overwhelming.

46
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:41,468
DAPHNE:
Oh, Niles.

47
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:42,735
During my operation

48
00:01:42,735 --> 00:01:45,505
I was technically dead
for several minutes.

49
00:01:45,705 --> 00:01:47,707
Yes, we know, son. You told us.

50
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:50,176
But it gave me a fresh
perspective on everything.

51
00:01:50,677 --> 00:01:51,678
It took a brush with death

52
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:53,980
to remind me how lucky I am
to be alive.

53
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:56,149
And Gertrude,
thank you for giving up

54
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:57,517
the guest bedroom

55
00:01:57,517 --> 00:01:59,519
so that I don't have
to climb all those stairs.

56
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:01,521
Oh, no, I'm happy
to sleep on that sofa bed

57
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:03,389
with the hard metal frame.

58
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:06,526
You have a nice, soft
bed in Manchester.

59
00:02:06,726 --> 00:02:08,728
Oh, Daphne, it's okay.

60
00:02:08,728 --> 00:02:10,230
Her bracing honesty reminds me

61
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:12,232
that I'm alive.

62
00:02:12,732 --> 00:02:15,101
You, you... Oh, you!

63
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:18,338
You are a treasure to me.

64
00:02:18,671 --> 00:02:21,207
I cherish every day
we're together.

65
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:24,711
Oh, thank you, Niles.

66
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:26,713
There may be others
around here

67
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:29,415
who could benefit
from a near-death experience.

68
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:33,419
Well, let's eat before
the fake-un loses its shape.

69
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,893
Wow, Niles is really loving
life with a vengeance.

70
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:41,728
I was the same way
after I got shot.

71
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:43,763
First day back at the precinct

72
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:45,265
I went around
hugging all the guys

73
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:47,066
Telling them all I loved 'em

74
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:48,201
How long did that last?

75
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:51,604
Until they started
calling me "Martina."

76
00:02:52,038 --> 00:02:53,606
It is kind of weird

77
00:02:53,606 --> 00:02:56,943
seeing Niles so lovey-dovey
with Mrs. Moon.

78
00:02:57,243 --> 00:02:58,311
Believe me,
when you're in that state

79
00:02:58,811 --> 00:03:00,780
you can find something to love
even in the biggest jerk.

80
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:03,750
Roz, I want to tell you you are a treasure.

81
00:03:05,151 --> 00:03:07,554
Maybe I don't say it often enough,
but you are.

82
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:09,455
Shut up, Martina.

83
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,963
(humming)

84
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:17,964
Hi.

85
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:19,365
I know that song.

86
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:22,135
0."
Yes, Mozart's
"Symphony Number 4

87
00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:23,503
Molto allegro.

88
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:25,004
I've just bought
this new recording for Niles.

89
00:03:25,004 --> 00:03:26,005
It is fantastic.

90
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:27,507
I've never heard
such string articulation.

91
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:28,875
Oh, I remember
what it is.

92
00:03:29,142 --> 00:03:30,710
It's that commercial
with the singing cats.

93
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:33,713
♪♪ If your cat has a yearnin
g for tuna ♪♪

94
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,215
♪
♪♪ Da-da-da, ocean buffet... ♪

95
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:38,685
One of the cats was wearing
a tiny tuxedo.

96
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:40,019
Good.

97
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,790
So few cats dress
for the symphony anymore.

98
00:03:44,123 --> 00:03:45,692
Frasier, Roz.
Oh, hi, guys.

99
00:03:46,192 --> 00:03:49,195
Guess who just walked
a mile on the treadmill.

100
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:50,964
Oh, way to go, Niles.

101
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:53,233
The doctor says he's
in the 95th percentile

102
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,735
of patients recovering
from bypass surgery.

103
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:58,238
95th percentile!
That's wonderful, Niles.

104
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,239
Well, now, Frasier

105
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,241
good health
is not a competition.

106
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:04,244
When you've heard time's
winged chariot hurrying near

107
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,246
as I have,
every day is a gift.

108
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,247
Oh, yoiks.

109
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,182
What tone-deaf prankster
gave you this?

110
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:10,950
You've heard it?

111
00:04:11,217 --> 00:04:12,285
Well, as much as I could bear.

112
00:04:12,785 --> 00:04:13,786
Did you hear what the conductor did

113
00:04:13,786 --> 00:04:15,288
to the andante?

114
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:17,156
I just hope
he bought it dinner first

115
00:04:17,156 --> 00:04:18,992
Well, I couldn't
agree more, Niles.

116
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:21,694
Frasier, you said
you loved that CD.

117
00:04:21,694 --> 00:04:23,963
Well, Niles has convinced me
otherwise.

118
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:25,898
You know, I'm in
the mood for a scone.

119
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:27,767
Help me pick one out.
All right.

120
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:29,602
That was weird.
I'll say.

121
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:32,939
Who can't pick out
their own scone?

122
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:34,653
No. I mean you and Niles.

123
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,844
Usually that would have been
a two-hour argument

124
00:04:38,344 --> 00:04:40,647
ending in tears
and cursing in Italian.

125
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:42,315
I'm afraid those days
are over, Roz.

126
00:04:42,682 --> 00:04:43,683
What happened?

127
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:46,119
Well, it's a long story.

128
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:48,621
Okay. When Niles
was in the hospital

129
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,658
and he was being wheeled
into surgery...

130
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:57,497
he looked so frail and vulnerable

131
00:04:57,497 --> 00:04:58,398
so I..

132
00:04:58,398 --> 00:05:02,802
I took my case
to a higher power.

133
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:09,275
Hello, God.

134
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:12,312
It'’’s me, Dr. Frasier Crane

135
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:16,316
Though I don't talk to you
as often as perhaps I should

136
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,818
I want to thank you
for all the times

137
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:20,820
you've indulged me in the past

138
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,823
Although, I have yet to see
the inside of the Empire Club--

139
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,825
just kidding.

140
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:33,333
Anyway, today I ask you to look
after my brother, Niles Crane.

141
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:37,337
I love him, even if I don't always show it.

142
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,339
And I regret all the time

143
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,342
he and I wasted
in petty quarrels.

144
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:47,347
If you spare him, oh, Lord,

145
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:51,684
I promise to cherish
every moment we have together.

146
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:52,985
But, Frasier,
you don't think

147
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:54,987
God is going to strike Niles down

148
00:05:54,987 --> 00:05:56,789
if you get in an argument,
do you?

149
00:05:56,989 --> 00:06:00,560
Well, technically,
the way it's structured

150
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,061
he'd come after me.

151
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:06,065
Seeing as how I was the one

152
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:08,401
that initiated the deal, you see?

153
00:06:08,634 --> 00:06:09,702
If I'd had more time,

154
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:12,505
I might have worded thin
gs differently, but...

155
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:14,240
Oh, oh, uh, le
t's get this to go

156
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,775
My soap starts in 20 minutes.

157
00:06:15,775 --> 00:06:18,277
Ashley might come
out of her coma today.

158
00:06:18,277 --> 00:06:22,782
You know, since your
recovery is going so well

159
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:24,784
maybe we should check you out

160
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:27,286
make sure all your equipment's
working properly.

161
00:06:29,288 --> 00:06:33,292
You're not talking about my exercise bicycle,
are you?

162
00:06:33,292 --> 00:06:35,595
The doctor said
it would be okay.

163
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:37,897
If you need
a second opinion

164
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:40,900
maybe Nurse Naughty
could make a house call.

165
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:46,406
I could use a checkup.

166
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:49,409
But I think we should
err on the side of caution

167
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,910
In a few weeks, I have another stress test.

168
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,412
Thank you.

169
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,914
And if all goes well,
Nurse Naughty will be

170
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:57,417
one satisfied
healthcare professional.

171
00:06:58,418 --> 00:06:59,419
See you.

172
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:00,920
Oh, bye, guys.

173
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,922
Oh, Niles, wait.

174
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,424
Frasier says he thinks

175
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,926
the string articulation
is really good.

176
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,294
In this?

177
00:07:08,294 --> 00:07:10,129
Frasier, you know
I hold your opinion

178
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:12,031
in highest regard,
but are you nuts?

179
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:13,933
Perhaps, I am, Niles.
Thank you.

180
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,802
Maybe you just need
to get your hearing checked.

181
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:18,271
I'll do that.
Thank you, Niles.

182
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,273
(loudly):
I'll see you later!

183
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,774
(chuckles)

184
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,276
Very amusing.

185
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,777
I get it.

186
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:32,118
Oh, oh, here they are.

187
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:40,626
Frasier, Frasier,
tell them what you told me.

188
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:45,131
I never thought
I'd live to see the day.

189
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,400
Perhaps this is why
I was spared.

190
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,471
Niles, how was your stress test?

191
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:54,340
Oh, the doctor cleared me
to return to normal food

192
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,675
and regular physical activity.

193
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,910
Oh, Darling,
that's wonderful.

194
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:00,613
Yes, yes.
In moderation, of course.

195
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:01,948
Congratulations, son.

196
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:03,316
Perhaps now, Niles

197
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,984
we can get back
to the squash courts.

198
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:07,186
Oh, I don't think so.

199
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:09,722
But the doctor said
it was okay.

200
00:08:09,722 --> 00:08:11,491
Yeah, but shouldn't there
be more to life

201
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,326
than competition for useless bragging rights?

202
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,661
You didn't think they
were useless three months ago

203
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,063
when you won.

204
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:20,833
You bragged for three months.

205
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,169
I've changed a lot
since then.

206
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,171
The point is that
I have roses

207
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,572
to stop and smell.

208
00:08:26,572 --> 00:08:28,474
I see. So, let me
get this straight.

209
00:08:28,474 --> 00:08:30,343
You're going to give up squash and smell roses.

210
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:32,678
Poor Frasier.

211
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,049
I hope that you don't have to go
through what I did

212
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:39,185
in order to become
as wise as I have.

213
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:42,021
You can still be wise
and play squash, darling.

214
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:44,457
Daphne's right.
Go out, have some fun.

215
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:45,892
But I am having fun.

216
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:48,895
Since my incident,
birds sing more sweetly.

217
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,363
The sky is so much bluer.

218
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:52,665
Niles, it has rained
every day this week.

219
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,302
I see rain differently, too.

220
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:57,670
There's something I need
to tell you.

221
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,972
It's something I've been thinking about.

222
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:01,807
(thunder crashing)

223
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:07,380
You were saying, Frasier?

224
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,016
Nothing.

225
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:19,091
My grandmother died
a couple of weeks ago

226
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:20,693
and I feel bad
because I never told her

227
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:22,461
how much she meant to me.

228
00:09:22,862 --> 00:09:24,430
Well, my heart certainly
goes out to you.

229
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:27,767
Grieving is difficult enough
without those unresolved...

230
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:29,101
Frasier, I'm sorry.

231
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:31,504
But we have Dr. Niles Crane
on line two.

232
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:35,441
I'm sure you all remember my brother Niles...

233
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:38,945
from our last segment.

234
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:41,414
I'm sure all my listeners join me

235
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:44,450
in hoping he can get back
to work real soon.

236
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:45,418
Thank you, Frasier.

237
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,453
I just thought I'd add
the perspective

238
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:50,790
of one who has ducked
the scythe of the Grim Reaper.

239
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:53,025
By all means.
Go ahead, Niles.

240
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:56,896
Your grandmother knows
how you feel.

241
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:59,398
When I was briefly dead

242
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:01,901
the overriding feeling I had

243
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:05,237
was the love of my family
and friends.

244
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:07,073
MAN:
Wow, so I shouldn't
feel bad?

245
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:08,074
NILES:
Certainly not.

246
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:10,042
Get out there
and live your life, Grant.

247
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:12,411
Carpe that diem.

248
00:10:12,411 --> 00:10:14,413
Isn't that right, Frasier?

249
00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:16,482
I couldn't agree more, Niles

250
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:18,918
We'll be right back
after traffic.

251
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:31,197
I'm beginning to regret
betting on the clown.

252
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:33,966
Roz, I can't eat,
I can't sleep.

253
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:36,435
I just lie in bed
awake at night

254
00:10:36,435 --> 00:10:38,938
mentally arguing
with Niles.

255
00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:41,407
And I win every time!

256
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:42,608
Frasier,
this is insane

257
00:10:42,908 --> 00:10:45,478
Do you really think
something bad is going to happen

258
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:46,979
if you break your deal with God?

259
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:48,447
Oh, of course not.

260
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,448
Well, maybe a little.

261
00:10:49,448 --> 00:10:50,416
I don't know.

262
00:10:52,618 --> 00:10:55,621
Roz, my brother could have died.

263
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:59,158
I can't be ungrateful
to whatever higher power

264
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:00,660
may have spared him.

265
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,161
I just can't imagine

266
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:04,163
that God would be upset...

267
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,498
Roz!
Oh, he's God,

268
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,833
Have you read
the Old Testamtent?

269
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,235
He can be ruthless!

270
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:12,138
Traffic's done.
You're on in five.

271
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:16,642
Welcome back, Seattle.

272
00:11:16,642 --> 00:11:19,145
Oh, I see we have someone
on line two.

273
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:21,647
Go ahead, caller. I'm listening.

274
00:11:21,647 --> 00:11:23,149
NILES:
Still me, Frasier.

275
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:24,583
Say, I had some thoughts

276
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:26,952
about your advice to Cynthia
from Tacoma.

277
00:11:26,952 --> 00:11:28,821
Speaking as one who has walked

278
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:30,890
through the valley
of the shadow of death

279
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,826
Cynthia,
I think diet and exercise

280
00:11:33,826 --> 00:11:35,394
should take care
of your problems.

281
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:38,397
Nothing like a good
fat-free muffin...

282
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:42,902
Hi, Daph,
I'm here for Niles.

283
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:43,903
He's at your place.

284
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:45,805
He said you were meeting
him there for dinner.

285
00:11:46,138 --> 00:11:49,108
I specifically told him
I would pick him up here.

286
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:50,476
Sorry.

287
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:53,479
Not bad enough he usurps
my radio show...

288
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:55,281
What are you doing?

289
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:58,084
Oh, you'll think I'm silly

290
00:11:58,084 --> 00:12:00,352
but I'm donating food to the poor.

291
00:12:00,686 --> 00:12:03,155
Why would I think that's silly?
What does that say about me?

292
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:05,024
No, I was just going to say...

293
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:06,392
I do my bit
for charity, you know.

294
00:12:06,692 --> 00:12:07,760
You have no idea
how many vacations

295
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,695
I've bought
at silent auctions.

296
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:11,664
No, that's not it.

297
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:14,166
You see, when I found out
Niles needed heart surgery

298
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:16,168
I felt so scared and helpless.

299
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:19,672
So, I kind of made a vow
that if he came out okay

300
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:22,174
I would spend more time
helping the less fortunate.

301
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:25,611
A vow?
You mean like a promise to God?

302
00:12:25,978 --> 00:12:28,013
I know it must sound absurd
to you, a man of science.

303
00:12:28,547 --> 00:12:30,049
No, no.

304
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:30,983
Now, when...

305
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:33,385
exactly did you make
this promise?

306
00:12:33,786 --> 00:12:35,254
The night before his surgery.

307
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:38,591
The night before, you say.

308
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:40,459
Interesting.

309
00:12:40,826 --> 00:12:41,894
You say Niles
is at my place?

310
00:12:41,894 --> 00:12:43,395
Yeah.

311
00:12:43,395 --> 00:12:44,897
Excuse me.

312
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:46,899
Keep up the good work.

313
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:52,404
What's all this?

314
00:12:52,404 --> 00:12:53,405
Food for the poor.

315
00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:56,408
Oh, must be nice
to be poor

316
00:12:56,408 --> 00:12:59,245
and have people just
giving you food.

317
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:04,083
Daphne, you were up
awfully late last night.

318
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:06,452
Yeah, I was watching television.

319
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:07,920
Were you?

320
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,422
Or was that husband of yours
sneaking upstairs

321
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:13,926
to demand you perform your wifely chore?

322
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:14,927
I wish.

323
00:13:15,427 --> 00:13:18,330
He's still not ready to be
in the same bed with me.

324
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:21,233
He's rich and you don't
have to sleep with him?

325
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:23,102
Rub it in, why don't you?

326
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:27,006
I know he's trying
to ease back into things

327
00:13:27,506 --> 00:13:30,009
but it's been weeks since
the doctor said he was okay.

328
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:32,478
Well, isn't it obvious?

329
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:36,482
The poor thing's probably
not feeling very attractive.

330
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:42,388
He's all skinny and pale,
and now he has that scar, too.

331
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:44,790
I don't think
that's it, Mum.

332
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:47,293
I just think he's scared.
And I understand that.

333
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:49,562
But how long are we going
to go on like this?

334
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:51,764
Until you stop babying him.

335
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:52,631
I'm not babying him.

336
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:54,133
I'm just giving him
the time he needs.

337
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:55,634
Oh, piffle.

338
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:57,870
What he needs is
a swift kick in the bum.

339
00:13:58,103 --> 00:14:02,074
Look, you've got to seduce him.

340
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:05,477
Use your feminine wiles.

341
00:14:05,477 --> 00:14:09,815
That's how your brother Billy landed Kevin.

342
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:14,620
Well, sharing a cell helped.

343
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:19,525
You know, maybe
I'll give that a try.

344
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:22,461
When Niles walks into
that guest room tonight

345
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:24,964
I'll have a surprise
waiting for him--

346
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:27,967
candles, soft music,
a negligee...

347
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:29,468
nothing too sexy.

348
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:30,836
We don't want
to strain his heart.

349
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:33,639
There's nothing wrong with your ego.

350
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:35,507
Thanks for the advice, Mum.

351
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:37,509
My pleasure, love.

352
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,979
Oh, and since you and Niles
will be in the guest room

353
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:41,480
I'll sleep in your room tonight.

354
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:44,884
No sense in letting that
king-size bed go to waste.

355
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:48,087
This time use a coaster
when you take your teeth out.

356
00:14:51,857 --> 00:14:54,393
Stop the tape.

357
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:55,728
Who's he again?

358
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:57,062
That's Diego

359
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:59,031
the illegitimate son
of Sonya LaFontaine.

360
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:03,369
He joined the army to avenge
the death of his brother.

361
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:05,871
Although, frankly,
I'm a little worried about him

362
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:09,174
I'm not sure he's figh
this war for the right reasons.

363
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:11,510


Hey, you want some of this fancy dessert?

364
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:12,511
It must be really good

365
00:15:12,511 --> 00:15:14,513
because Frasier told
me not to touch it

366
00:15:14,513 --> 00:15:16,015
No, no, thanks.

367
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:18,450
I brought some of these
tasty rye flats

368
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:22,888
in case I...
in case I feel peckish.

369
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:24,890
They look like wood.

370
00:15:29,194 --> 00:15:30,763
Well, he di

371
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,731
But, you know, I feel my tastes
have gotten simpler

372
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:35,234
since I cheated death.

373
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:44,076
It's hard to explain.

374
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:45,411
Don't need to explain
to me, son.

375
00:15:45,911 --> 00:15:47,413
I know what it's like
to cheat death.

376
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:48,747
That's true.

377
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:51,350
Although I think I got a little
closer than you did.

378
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:55,587
Oh, really?

379
00:15:55,587 --> 00:15:57,656
Well, let's see...

380
00:15:57,656 --> 00:16:02,628
I got shot by a gun
and you ate a bunch of cheese.

381
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:06,098
I was clinically dead
for several minutes.

382
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:08,334
I looked death
square in the eye.

383
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:11,503
You may have looked him in
the eye, but I shook his hand.

384
00:16:11,503 --> 00:16:14,273
Really?
Well, I kissed him on the cheek.

385
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:17,176
Well, I kissed him on the lips.

386
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:19,945
Also, Death was a girl.

387
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:22,848
Dad, I don't want to turn this into a competition.

388
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:25,284
I'm just trying to embrace life to the fullest.

389
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:27,753
Oh, would you
give it a rest.

390
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:28,754
Excuse me?

391
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:30,255
You haven't embraced a damn thing.

392
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:31,256
All you're doing is yakking about

393
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:32,758
feeling this and
experiencing that.

394
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:33,659
You're not doing anything.

395
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:36,362
You won't go back to work

396
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:38,630
or play squash or eat
any of your favorite foods.

397
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:42,601
I'm easing into things
until I'm back to normal.

398
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:44,536
The doctor says you're there.

399
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:47,006
Well, I'm just being
extra cautious.

400
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:50,743
Sounds to me like you're afraid, son.

401
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:53,512
Well, what if I am?

402
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,014
Haven't I earned the right to be afraid?

403
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:56,415
I could have died.

404
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:58,317
I understand.
Okay.

405
00:16:58,317 --> 00:16:59,818
When I got out of the hospital

406
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:02,154
I was terrified to take a risk.

407
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:04,990
Just didn't want
to leave the house.

408
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:09,495
Ducked for cover every time
a car backfired.

409
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:14,967
I know my fears aren't rational.

410
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:17,469
I know my heart is sound.

411
00:17:17,469 --> 00:17:20,472
I feel fine.

412
00:17:20,472 --> 00:17:22,241
But I felt fine
before this happened.

413
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:24,309
How do I know

414
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:25,644
that the same thing isn't.

415
00:17:25,644 --> 00:17:26,645
You don't know.

416
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:28,647
That's exactly
what I came to realize.

417
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:30,149
Life's a crap shoot.

418
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:32,151
We could all go at any time.

419
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:35,921
That's why we have to make the
most of whatever time we've got.

420
00:17:37,689 --> 00:17:40,192
Like sand through the hourglass

421
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:43,529
so are the days of our lives.

422
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:47,866
Okay, point taken.

423
00:17:49,868 --> 00:17:50,869
Thank you, Dad.

424
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:52,337
Where are you going?

425
00:17:52,337 --> 00:17:54,206
To live my life.

426
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,975
You forgot the rye flats.

427
00:17:57,309 --> 00:18:01,380
No, I didn't, Dad.
No, I didn't.

428
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,182
Well, you're not
leaving them here.

429
00:18:10,522 --> 00:18:12,024
Good evening.

430
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:23,902


Hello, God, it's me again.

431
00:18:23,902 --> 00:18:27,406
Dr. Frasier Crane.

432
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:30,909
Listen, it seems that when
we made our little arrangement

433
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:34,713
there was another deal in place.

434
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:36,982
Now, I've had some experience
with double-booking

435
00:18:36,982 --> 00:18:39,485
and I know that the person
who books first

436
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:42,287
always gets priority.

437
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:44,590
So, as long as Daphne
keeps up her end...

438
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:47,593
which she is, to the letter--

439
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:50,596
it seems our little arrangement

440
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:54,099
would be rendered null and void.

441
00:18:54,600 --> 00:19:00,439
Ergo, I am now going to yell
at my brother.

442
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:03,775
Unless of course, you give me a sign.

443
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:11,250
Very well, then.

444
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:15,020
This is going to be sweet.

445
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,421
(elevator dings)

446
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:18,090
Niles!

447
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:19,291
There you are.

448
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:20,359
You're 40 minutes late.
Well, no matter.

449
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:21,793
I have more important things to do.

450
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:23,362
Not so fast, mister!

451
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:25,330
You, sir, have been
insufferable for the
past few weeks.

452
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,832
It might enlighten
you to know

453
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:27,833
that your endless preaching

454
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,835
has been nothing more
than a thin cover

455
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,270
for your fear...
Yes, I know.

456
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,704
I know, Dad just told me.

457
00:19:32,704 --> 00:19:34,573
And he was right,
I've been an ass lately.

458
00:19:34,873 --> 00:19:35,941
I'm really sorry,
but I have to go.

459
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:37,276
My wife is waiting for me.

460
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:38,610
Frankly, Frasier,

461
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:39,912
I'm surprised you didn't
bring this up sooner.

462
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:41,280
But...

463
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:53,292
Huh.

464
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:55,794
Well played, God.

465
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:04,303
I'll see you at Easter.

466
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:24,223
(high-pitched scream)

467
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:29,828
Niles!

468
00:20:29,828 --> 00:20:31,029
What happened?

469
00:20:33,865 --> 00:20:34,833
Are you all right?
Yes.

470
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:37,135
I just jumped into bed
with your mother.

471
00:20:37,135 --> 00:20:39,338
Oh, dear.
No wonder she screamed.

472
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:41,506
That wasn't her.

473
00:20:41,506 --> 00:20:43,642
What were you doing in there?

474
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:47,913
I just... wanted to...
take my wife in my arms

475
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,414
and show her how much I love her.

476
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:51,783
Are you sure you're ready?

477
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:54,186
Trust me,
if my heart can take that

478
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:55,554
it can take anything.
