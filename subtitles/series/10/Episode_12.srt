1
00:00:08,074 --> 00:00:10,577
When the phone company says
they will be at your door

2
00:00:10,577 --> 00:00:12,078
between the hours
of 9:00 and noon

3
00:00:12,078 --> 00:00:14,581
they have entered
into a verbal contract.

4
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:18,451
If they show up at 12:47, they
are in breach of said contract.

5
00:00:18,451 --> 00:00:20,286
Again, I agree.

6
00:00:20,286 --> 00:00:21,221
Well, I just shouldn't

7
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:22,756
have waited
for them, that's all.

8
00:00:22,756 --> 00:00:24,224
Now my entire day is thrown off.

9
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:27,660
Still, I appreciate your taking
the time to give me a lift.

10
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,629
FRASIER:
Yes, well, when you informed me

11
00:00:29,629 --> 00:00:31,965
you had to get to
the Promenade shops posthaste

12
00:00:31,965 --> 00:00:34,300
I assumed it was
an actual emergency--

13
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,669
not to return a cage

14
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:38,972
for some silly lovebirds.

15
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:41,541
It may not be on the order
of a fallen pant cuff,

16
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:44,044
but until I get back home
with something more secure,

17
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:47,447
little Daphne and Niles
are living under a colander.

18
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:49,582
Dear God..

19
00:00:49,582 --> 00:00:52,819
don't tell me you actually named them
 after yourselves.

20
00:00:52,819 --> 00:00:55,088
A big mistake, I admit.

21
00:00:55,288 --> 00:00:56,790
This morning
when Daphne escaped,

22
00:00:57,157 --> 00:01:00,226
I just kept thinking
"What if she's hurt or lost

23
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:01,227
or eaten by a cat?"

24
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:03,696
Or worse...
"What if she meets a bird

25
00:01:03,696 --> 00:01:08,034
who's more birdly than Niles
 but without the substance."

26
00:01:08,034 --> 00:01:12,338
Trust me, no one
is more birdly than Niles.

27
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:16,543
What is with
all this traffic?

28
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:19,012
I tell you, don't
these people have jobs?

29
00:01:19,012 --> 00:01:20,513
Some of us have a radio show to
do.

30
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:23,983
Frasier, relax, you're not on
for another hour and a half.

31
00:01:23,983 --> 00:01:28,021
Well... that
can't be right.

32
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:29,522
Oh, dear God!

33
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:32,025
My show's
on in 15 minutes!

34
00:01:32,025 --> 00:01:33,493
I had no idea
it was so late.

35
00:01:33,493 --> 00:01:34,928
Hey, you can just
drop me out front.

36
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:36,496
I'll get a cab home.

37
00:01:36,496 --> 00:01:39,165
FRASIER:
I'm afraid I'll have to.
Damn it!

38
00:01:39,165 --> 00:01:41,167
I tell you, he gets in here and
wants to hear his radio station

39
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:45,171
and he starts pushing buttons
like a lab rat on amphetamines.

40
00:01:57,684 --> 00:01:59,686
Excuse me.
We've changed our minds.

41
00:02:00,186 --> 00:02:01,688
We won't be parking.

42
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:04,691
That's two dollars.

43
00:02:05,024 --> 00:02:06,593
No, you see, we just came in
for a second

44
00:02:06,593 --> 00:02:07,594
and decided not to park.

45
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:09,062
Just check the time
on the ticket.

46
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:12,065
Look, it's two dollars for any portion
 of 20 minutes.

47
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:13,566
One second, ten minutes,
whatever.

48
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:16,336
Unless you go over,
then it's two more dollars

49
00:02:16,536 --> 00:02:20,974
Forgive me.
Perhaps I'm not being clear.

50
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:23,810
You see, I mistakenly pulled
in here, decided not to park,

51
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,211
and now I'd like
to just get out.

52
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:26,513
Two dollars.

53
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,914
I have two dollars.

54
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:31,050
ATTENDANT:
Sorry, your mistake

55
00:02:31,417 --> 00:02:32,852
you pay; that's policy.

56
00:02:32,852 --> 00:02:34,220
Oh, really?

57
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,723
It just so happens that I have
a few policies of my own,

58
00:02:37,223 --> 00:02:40,026
and one of them is that I do not
pay good money for nothing.

59
00:02:40,226 --> 00:02:41,294
Well, not for nothing

60
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:42,729
but your car's taking up space
 on the property.

61
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:44,664
That's not parking.
It's parked to me.

62
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,166
But it's been continually in motion.

63
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:47,467
It stopped.

64
00:02:47,734 --> 00:02:48,735
But it's still running.

65
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:51,137
It's parked.
Look, the fee is two dollars.

66
00:02:51,137 --> 00:02:52,472
.
There's nothing you can do

67
00:02:52,772 --> 00:02:53,840
Is that so?

68
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:55,742
Did you hear that, Niles?

69
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:58,478
Yes, and it makes sense to me.

70
00:02:58,711 --> 00:03:00,780
Fine.

71
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:03,917
Have it your way.

72
00:03:06,252 --> 00:03:08,021
(engine shuts off)

73
00:03:08,254 --> 00:03:10,323
What are we doing, Frasier?

74
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:11,824
If I'm going to be paying for parking,

75
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:14,794
we are going to get
our 20 minutes worth.

76
00:03:14,794 --> 00:03:17,630
Then he may have my $2.

77
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:20,133
(car horns honking)

78
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,712
and a little bit of sky.

79
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:36,216
Ear with sky.

80
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,718
Ear with sky.

81
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:39,886
Well, this is it.

82
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,387
Sorry, it's
taken me so long

83
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:43,389
to pick up the
last of my things.

84
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:44,891
Oh, no problem.

85
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:47,660
Frasier's not having
the carpet people here
till Friday.

86
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:48,428
Oh, really?

87
00:03:48,928 --> 00:03:49,929
When it was my room

88
00:03:49,929 --> 00:03:51,931
he said the carpet's
 good for another 20 years.

89
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:55,735
Yeah, well, now it's going
to be a reading sanctuary.

90
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,470
He's turning my room
into a library?

91
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:01,407
No, he made it very clear
it was a reading sanctuary.

92
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:03,309
A library implies sharing.

93
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:08,214
I think there are some pieces
missing from this one.

94
00:04:08,214 --> 00:04:09,749
You always say that.
Keep looking.

95
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,684
Why do I even do
this stupid thing?

96
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,152
Some puzzle. There's a picture

97
00:04:13,653 --> 00:04:14,654
of what it's going to look like
 right on the box.

98
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,556
You always say that, too.

99
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:19,959
(barking)

100
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,494
What's wrong, Eddie?

101
00:04:21,494 --> 00:04:22,495
Come, boy.

102
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:24,163
He must know

103
00:04:24,163 --> 00:04:25,231
you're moving.

104
00:04:25,231 --> 00:04:26,733
He gets this way whenever
I bring out my suitcase.

105
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:29,235
He knows I'm going away,
and he starts raising hell.

106
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:30,169
Boy, come.

107
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:31,638
(barking continues)

108
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:33,606
Yeah, that's what it looks like.

109
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,608
Well, there's nothing
to get upset about.

110
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:38,111
I'll be here every day
for your physical therapy.

111
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,012
You hear that, boy?

112
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:42,749
She'll be here every day
to torture your master.

113
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,485
(barks)

114
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:47,086
What should I do?

115
00:04:47,086 --> 00:04:51,224
Maybe it'd distract him
if you made me lunch.

116
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:57,530
(horn honking)

117
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:00,400
Hold it, man!

118
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:01,634
Dumbass!

119
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:05,138
Other motorists
are getting angry.

120
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:07,006
If they weren't so shortsighted

121
00:05:07,006 --> 00:05:08,541
they'd see that I'm doing
this for their own good.

122
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:10,043
Like correcting
people's grammar--

123
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:12,445
I don't do it to be popular.

124
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:13,846
And I support that,
but in this case

125
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:15,815
I strongly feel that we should
pay the money

126
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,350
and get out of here
before there's violence.

127
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:19,819
Oh, Niles, they can get
around us if they want to.

128
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,854
So, what, it takes them
an extra two seconds?

129
00:05:21,854 --> 00:05:24,297
It's a small price to pay
for making this a better world.

130
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,528
Niles, you'll get home

131
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:31,431
to your stupid, filthy birds
soon enough!

132
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:35,301
I meant that your radio show
is about to start.

133
00:05:35,301 --> 00:05:37,170
Dumbass.

134
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,005
(horns honking)

135
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:41,841
Right.

136
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,676
doc?
Where the hell's the

137
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:44,677
He still isn't here.

138
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,179
It's almost show time.

139
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,681
I swear to God nobody
here has any discipline.

140
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:55,388
I mean, gee whiz,
I try to make ever

141
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:58,157
and all it gets me
is a twisted gut.

142
00:05:58,157 --> 00:05:59,926
Well, no more.

143
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:01,928
This Saturday, we're going
 to have a staff meeting.

144
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:03,830
We're going to hash out some rules.

145
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,631
I'm busy Saturday.

146
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:08,000
.
Well, it's not mandatory

147
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,936
(phone rings)

148
00:06:09,936 --> 00:06:11,437
Roz Doyle.

149
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:14,374
Frasier, where are you?

150
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:15,842
What?

151
00:06:16,175 --> 00:06:17,210
He's at some mall.

152
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,746
He's still got ten minutes
of parking left.

153
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:23,149
You know, you don't have to us
the full 20 minutes.

154
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:25,785
(Frasier yelling indistinctly)
He knows that.

155
00:06:26,018 --> 00:06:27,887
What are you doing?

156
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:33,993
What? You lost me
after Gandhi.

157
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,795
Just stall.

158
00:06:36,295 --> 00:06:37,263
I don't know.

159
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:40,733
Read some fan mail,
if you have to.

160
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:42,135
There must be!

161
00:06:42,468 --> 00:06:45,338
Just check
in my in box!

162
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:46,639
Oh, never mind.

163
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,908
.
I'll be there when I get there

164
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:52,211
And when I do, I will have a
little speech for my listeners

165
00:06:52,211 --> 00:06:55,148
about the power of one.

166
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:57,850
Sounds like everybody's
a winner today.

167
00:06:59,652 --> 00:07:01,154
Are you being snide?

168
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:03,022
.
Because that's not helping

169
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:05,425
I will just go
and return my birdcage.

170
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,427
Niles, you close
that door!

171
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,695
You can't desert me in the middle of a fight.

172
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:11,230
I'm not deserting you.

173
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:12,965
It would appear to others
that you are,

174
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:15,001
thereby weakening my position.

175
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:16,335
Please, you must stay.

176
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:22,108
What the hell is going on here?

177
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:23,876
I'm glad you asked me
that question.

178
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:26,145
I'm making a stand
against this garage

179
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:29,582
that holds me, my passenger
and my automobile hostage

180
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:31,918
for a parking fee
which I do not owe.

181
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:35,121
He don't want
to pay two dollars.

182
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,389
.
I already told you,
it's not about the money

183
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:38,791
In fact, to prove it
's not about the money,

184
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:41,727
I will donate two dollars
to the charity of your choice.

185
00:07:41,727 --> 00:07:44,197
Only rich people have time
for this kind of crap.

186
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:47,099
Just pay the two bucks, Mr. BMW.

187
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:50,803
My income and the style of car
which I drive are irrelevant.

188
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:52,004
Isn't that so, Niles?

189
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:53,306
Yes. I drive a Mercedes

190
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,808
and I would have paid
ten minutes ago.

191
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,278
I told my boss
I have a non-pay.

192
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:01,147
Oh. You see, Niles,
this happens so often

193
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,682
they actually have a name
for us.

194
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:04,951
More than one, I bet.

195
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:06,819
Just sign the form where it says
"Unable to Pay"

196
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:08,221
and you can send
us a check.

197
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:11,557
(laughs)
I'm certainly not
going to send you a check.

198
00:08:11,924 --> 00:08:12,992
Look, most people don't.

199
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:16,262
Just sign the form
so I can get this gate open.

200
00:08:16,462 --> 00:08:17,530
.
Oh, Frasier, it's an out

201
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:18,531
You should take it.

202
00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:19,999
Niles, I refuse to sign anything

203
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:22,001
that says I am unable to pay--
it's untrue.

204
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,769
ATTENDANT:
Look, I really
don't care, Jack.

205
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,905
I just got to get
this lane reopened

206
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:27,974
Now, it's either two dollars or the form

207
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:29,175
so I can put it in my drawer.

208
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:31,010
You know my terms:
you will receive your money

209
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,011
when the 20 minutes is up.

210
00:08:32,411 --> 00:08:33,479
Fine.

211
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:35,248
Then I'll put in my own money.

212
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:36,449
No, no, you can't do that.

213
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:37,383
.
It's too late. It's on me

214
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:38,684
Go ahead, Mr. Beemer.

215
00:08:38,951 --> 00:08:40,019
Don't you call me that.

216
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:42,421
!
You put that down right now.
We're not going anywhere

217
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:44,824
(horns honking)
(Niles screams)

218
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,126
I can't do this anymore,
Frasier!

219
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:50,863
Will you excuse me?

220
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:55,801
What are you talking about?

221
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:57,203
Do you really want justice?

222
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:59,672
Or is this just an outlet
for your bad mood?

223
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:01,173
Oh, fine, just go.

224
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:05,177
And bravo for staying
a whole ten minutes.

225
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:06,479
Good-bye!

226
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:11,751
I don't blame you

227
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:13,653
for bailing
on that idiot.

228
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:17,023
He's not an idiot.
He's just passionate.

229
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:18,891
I think he's an idiot.

230
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:21,327
Suit yourself, idiot.

231
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:27,466
That idiot
happens to be my brother.

232
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:36,409
(horns honking)

233
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:57,530
Don't these people realize
 I'm on their side?

234
00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:01,000
I don't think they care
so long as you're in their lane.

235
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,970
I am doing this
for all of you!

236
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,338
Don't you understand?

237
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:07,707
us.
No, no, come out here and explain it to

238
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:09,642
Don't even think
about it, Frasier.

239
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:10,610
That man wants to hit you.

240
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,578
I'm not afraid.

241
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:23,956
People, please.

242
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:25,958
I am not the enemy.

243
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,260
I am your champion.

244
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,029
Well, we got places to be,
so move your ass.

245
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:31,530
WOMAN:
Yeah, move it.

246
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:33,332
But I'm doing this
for all of us.

247
00:10:33,332 --> 00:10:35,901
If you want to do something
for me, get out of the way.

248
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:38,104
Yeah, save the protest for your own driveway.

249
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,539
If you could only see things
from my point of view,

250
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:42,041
then I'm sure
you'd agree with me.

251
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:43,542
You see,
I pulled into this garage

252
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:45,044
decided not to park,
and now I want to leave

253
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:47,046
but they still insist
on collecting two dollars.

254
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,481
Is that fair?

255
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:51,050
Has a service been provided?

256
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:52,518
Even if it's a rip-off

257
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:54,286
it's better than causing
a big stink.

258
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:55,488
Ah, but is it?

259
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,056
I say no.

260
00:10:57,056 --> 00:10:58,557
I say we've been trod upon long enough

261
00:10:58,557 --> 00:11:01,060
by people who are supposedly
providing us services.

262
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,062
By the postmen who mix up
our deliveries--

263
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:04,563
by the telephone repairmen
who swear to be there

264
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:05,998
between 9:00 and noon

265
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:09,769
and yet arrive at 12:47 when you're wearing

266
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:13,506
nothing but a towel
and a head full of shampoo.

267
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,541
Well, enough!

268
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:19,545
I invoke my right
to peaceful protest.

269
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:23,549
Civil disobedience is a
cornerstone of this country,

270
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:26,052
for it is how
the common man is heard.

271
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:28,054
Can you tow it?

272
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:30,156
Not with him in it

273
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:37,630
Well, that's just tough luck,
 because we ain't budgin'

274
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,865
You'll have to call the police.

275
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:41,967
Good idea
About time.

276
00:11:41,967 --> 00:11:44,303
Go ahead!

277
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:53,179
I think I've made a mistake.

278
00:11:53,097 --> 00:11:55,548
Maybe it's time to back down

279
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:56,916
I'm not sure that I can.

280
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:58,784
I am right, after all.

281
00:11:58,784 --> 00:12:01,220
My principles
are holding me captive.

282
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,289
Your principles
may have started this,

283
00:12:05,357 --> 00:12:06,425
My right

284
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:08,928
The rigid ones are those
who operate this garage

285
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:10,796
and enforce
such inflexible policies.

286
00:12:10,796 --> 00:12:12,865
You've been given more
than one opportunity

287
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:14,233
to leave without paying.

288
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:15,601
Yes, but that's not the point.

289
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:17,603


They have to know why I won't pay.

290
00:12:17,603 --> 00:12:18,604
Which you could
explain in a letter.

291
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:20,606
But, no, you won't
be satisfied

292
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:22,108
until everyone either
agrees with you

293
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:25,611
or has suffered
for failing to.

294
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:27,913
Do you really think so?

295
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:30,049
I do.

296
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:32,418
Well...

297
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:35,354
that's quite an indictment

298
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,759
I've never really thought
 of myself as uncompromising.

299
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:43,763
Well, not in a bad way.

300
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:47,433
I'm not sure I like
this side of myself.

301
00:12:50,202 --> 00:12:51,270
If you can leave here

302
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,772
without getting
your full 20 minutes worth,

303
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,640
you'll be
the bigger person for it.

304
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,509
Yes, but then these taunting
motorists won't know

305
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,010
that I'm being
the bigger person.

306
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:00,012
They'll think they've gotten the better of me

307
00:13:00,012 --> 00:13:01,447
or that I'm afraid
to be arrested.

308
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:04,383
The bigger person doesn't worry about
 what other people think.

309
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:06,452
Damn!

310
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:07,953
I do want to be
the bigger person.

311
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:09,789
It's just so hard.

312
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:12,792
You know, we wouldn't
be in this mess

313
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:15,060
if it weren't for you
and that ridiculous birdcage.

314
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:17,630
Oh, come on.

315
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,466
I can only change
one character flaw at a time.

316
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,805
DAPHNE:
You were right
about distracting him.

317
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,306
He seems fine now.
But as soon as you head

318
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:29,208
for that door again,
he's going to have a fit

319
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:32,111
Let me get you
some dog treats
to give him.

320
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:41,587
I don't understand.

321
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:42,655
I may sleep across town

322
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:44,990
but I still see him
all the time.

323
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,525
Well, you've got to look at it

324
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:47,827
from Eddie's point of view.

325
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,395
This person who's meant
so much to him

326
00:13:49,895 --> 00:13:50,793
isn't going to be
living here anymore.

327
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:54,433
For nine years, he's felt the comfort

328
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:56,235
of knowing you were here
every night

329
00:13:56,569 --> 00:14:00,005
and making him his
breakfast every morning.

330
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:01,841
He's come to depend on that.

331
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:05,845
Now everything's changed.

332
00:14:08,914 --> 00:14:11,350
Oh, would
you look at that.

333
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:15,321
He's probably going
to get under my bed to pout.

334
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:17,323
I think he'll adjust.

335
00:14:17,823 --> 00:14:18,824
Well, who knows?

336
00:14:18,824 --> 00:14:22,828
Old dogs get used
to a certain routine.

337
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:25,497
And as tough
as they might look,

338
00:14:25,497 --> 00:14:27,566
they get lonely.

339
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:29,568
But I guess he'll adjust
eventually.

340
00:14:29,568 --> 00:14:33,038
You know, maybe I haven't be
en coming around enough lately.

341
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:35,541
Why don't you and I make
a regular appointment

342
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:37,109
to walk him together?

343
00:14:37,109 --> 00:14:39,178
Oh, geez, that'd be great.

344
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:41,180
I have to check with him

345
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,515
but he's free
most of the time.

346
00:14:43,515 --> 00:14:45,851
Why don't we start
tomorrow morning?

347
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:49,221
That way I can have breakfast
with the old boy, too.

348
00:14:49,521 --> 00:14:52,558
He'd really like that.

349
00:14:57,196 --> 00:14:59,765
(door closes)

350
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:10,276
and a fruit cup.

351
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:13,279
That takes care
of the St. Victoria's

352
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,282
elementary lunch schedule
for the next month.

353
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:20,252
We'll be back to tackle
St. Victor's after this.

354
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,824
Holy buckets,
what are you doing?

355
00:15:25,824 --> 00:15:27,226
Take some calls.

356
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:28,127
I'm not a shrink.

357
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,462
I can't tell people
what to do.

358
00:15:30,462 --> 00:15:32,698
Yeah, that always stops
you women.

359
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:35,567
Just rap about something.

360
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:37,503
Open up a discussion, you know.

361
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:39,271
over.
The station's I.D.'s

362
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:40,606
Go.
Okay.

363
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,107
Hello again, everybody.

364
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:45,110
Well, we're still
waiting on Dr. Crane,

365
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:48,113
so until he gets here,

366
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,115
let's hear what's
on your minds.

367
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:51,617
And you know the number.

368
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:55,854
Give me a call.

369
00:15:55,854 --> 00:15:57,856
Hello, caller.
You're on the air.

370
00:15:57,856 --> 00:16:00,859
MAN:
Hi, Roz, this is Mark
from Bainbridge,

371
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:02,361
and I made a big mistake.

372
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:04,863
(imitating Frasier):
Go on.

373
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:08,367
I slept with my boss.

374
00:16:08,867 --> 00:16:11,637
Now things at work
are super uncomfortable.

375
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:15,441
Well, Mark, I feel for you.

376
00:16:15,941 --> 00:16:18,944
I've been there myself.

377
00:16:18,944 --> 00:16:23,749
What you ought to do is just
talk it out with your boss.

378
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,551
You went through this, too?

379
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:28,053
Yeah. And it was weird
for a while

380
00:16:28,053 --> 00:16:32,057
but now,
things are just fine.

381
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:35,060
Who else out there
needs my advice?

382
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:37,563
Let me hear your calls.

383
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:39,565
You're on the air.

384
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:41,567
How can I solve your problem?

385
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:44,069
WOMAN:
Actually, I was calling
about something else,

386
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:45,571
but when you say
"now things are fine"

387
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:48,640
it sounds like you still
work with this person.

388
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,142
What?

389
00:16:50,642 --> 00:16:53,145
(chuckling):
No. No.

390
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:57,149
I worked with this person
a long, long time ago.

391
00:16:57,149 --> 00:17:00,152
Then why'd you say "now"?

392
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:06,158
Because...
I don't speak so good?

393
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:09,261
And... isn't Dr. Crane
your boss?

394
00:17:09,261 --> 00:17:12,664
Well, no. I like to think
of Frasier as a colleague.

395
00:17:12,664 --> 00:17:14,166
So now he's "Frasier."

396
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:15,667
No, uh... yeah...

397
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:17,169
.
I mean, it's just that I..

398
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:20,172
I think you did Frasier.

399
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:32,918
of your character.

400
00:17:32,918 --> 00:17:34,420
You can decide
right now

401
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,921
that you're going
to be the flexible one here.

402
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:37,923
Pay the money and go.

403
00:17:37,923 --> 00:17:39,224
I could break my pattern.

404
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:40,292
Yes.

405
00:17:40,292 --> 00:17:42,561
I could just pay the money

406
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,563
without proving to everyone
that I'm right.

407
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:45,998
Without teaching them
a lesson.

408
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:47,900
Exactly. You can do it.

409
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:53,272
Sir...

410
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:55,908
I'll have you know

411
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:58,510
I am leaving with time to spare.

412
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:00,679
Congratulations.

413
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:02,548
Since you cannot understand
the moral code

414
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:04,049
for which I stayed here,

415
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:06,051
I'm sure you must be perplex
ed that I am leaving

416
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:07,486
before the 20 minutes is up.

417
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:12,324
Suffice to say, I am
the bigger man for it.

418
00:18:12,324 --> 00:18:16,728
And you and your nefarious
policy may now carry on

419
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:21,100
in what is highway robbery
in the truest sense

420
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,268
of the expression.

421
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:24,970
Here is your ticket...

422
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,206
and...

423
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:32,044
your ill-gotten two dollars.

424
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:36,348
Four dollars.

425
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:39,184
Four dollars?!

426
00:18:39,184 --> 00:18:40,519
You went over 20 minutes.

427
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:43,789
It's two dollars for each portion of 20 minutes.

428
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,090
But I already backed down.

429
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:47,593
Well, if you would've
spared me the speech

430
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:49,094
you would've made it out
in time.

431
00:18:49,094 --> 00:18:52,064
Tough break, huh?

432
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:55,000
Indeed.

433
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:01,140
Hold on, Niles.

434
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,308
(tires screeching)

435
00:19:09,715 --> 00:19:11,216
I can't believe it.

436
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:13,218
I mean, I always
felt some chemistry

437
00:19:13,218 --> 00:19:15,721
between you and the doc but... wowza!

438
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:17,723
This can't hurt ratings.

439
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:19,992
Calm down, Kenny.
It isn't true.

440
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,293
(laughing):
Yeah, right.

441
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:24,096
Hey, you didn't do it here at the station, did you?

442
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:25,364
Of course not.

443
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:28,867
Hey, as long as it wasn't on my couch, who gives?

444
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:30,369
Hey, the commercial's over.

445
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:32,271
And we're back...

446
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:34,206
with our new topic:

447
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:37,643
Cats or dogs: which is better?

448
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:40,245
Hello, caller,
you're on the air.

449
00:19:40,245 --> 00:19:42,314
MAN:
This is Jerry from Elliot Bay.

450
00:19:42,814 --> 00:19:43,749
Which do you
have, Jerry,

451
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:45,150
cat or a dog?

452
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:47,152
Frasier, I'm so sorry.

453
00:19:47,152 --> 00:19:48,086
I really screwed up.

454
00:19:48,086 --> 00:19:49,821
That's all right, Roz.

455
00:19:49,821 --> 00:19:51,089
I'll take care
of everything.

456
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:53,659
I just want to know what's going on with Dr. Crane.

457
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:55,227
Yes, well,
I'll bet you do, Jerry.

458
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:57,229
Dr. Frasier Crane here, Seattle.

459
00:19:57,229 --> 00:19:58,230
I'm sorry I'm late.

460
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:01,533
It sounds like Roz has
informed you of my exploits.

461
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:02,868
She hasn't said much.

462
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,736
We'd like to hear it
from you.

463
00:20:04,736 --> 00:20:06,972
Well, it wasn't my finest hour

464
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:10,242
Let's just say
that I got in there

465
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:12,177
realized I made a mistake

466
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:15,581
and then tried like hell
to get out.

467
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:16,848
Frasier!

468
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:23,355
and then a line started
to form behind me.

469
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:26,858
Fortunately, my brother was
with me for moral support

470
00:20:26,858 --> 00:20:30,762
and, well, let's face it,
 somebody to talk to.

471
00:20:30,762 --> 00:20:32,631
You know,
you'd be amazed

472
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:36,068
how long 20 minutes can be
when you're watching the clock

473
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:38,070
At least, in the end

474
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:42,507
I got out of there without
paying the four dollars.
