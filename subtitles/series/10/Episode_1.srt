1
00:00:07,591 --> 00:00:12,062
I, Daphne Moon,
do take thee, Niles Crane,

2
00:00:12,054 --> 00:00:14,022
as my husband.

3
00:00:14,306 --> 00:00:18,231
I promise you my fidelity
and my support...

4
00:00:18,227 --> 00:00:21,527
My laughter and my tears...

5
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:25,527
My constant friendship
and my unending love

6
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:28,029
as long as we both shall live.

7
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:30,997
I, Niles Crane, do take thee,

8
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:33,333
Daphne Moon, as my wife.

9
00:00:33,325 --> 00:00:37,171
I vow to you my fidelity
and my support

10
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:40,587
my honor and my respect.

11
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:43,586
My honesty and my protection.

12
00:00:44,086 --> 00:00:46,589
You are my comfort, my joy,

13
00:00:47,089 --> 00:00:49,091
and my one true love.

14
00:00:49,091 --> 00:00:52,595
I will cherish you all the days
of my life

15
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:55,097
and treasure the journey
that has brought us

16
00:00:55,097 --> 00:00:58,101
to this most wonderful,
perfect place.

17
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,603
For most folks, that's
one too many free cocktails.

18
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:03,105
(laughing):
Am I right?

19
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:07,033
Seriously,
do you have the rings?

20
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:09,448
Oh... no.
In our rush to get here,

21
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:11,446
I completely forgot about them.

22
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:12,914
Does this mean we can't get married?

23
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:14,825
It would if we didn't offer

24
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:19,331
seven different wedding band
packages for you to choose from.

25
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:20,797
Now, depending on your budget,

26
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:23,838
we can offer you anything
from the "Be Steel My Heart"--

27
00:01:23,834 --> 00:01:25,836
that's genuine stainless
right there--

28
00:01:25,836 --> 00:01:27,338
to the "Never-ending Love"

29
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:30,181
which can be returned for up
to 90 days; no questions asked.

30
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:33,469
They do seem
the nicest.

31
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:35,470
(cell phone rings)

32
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:38,440
Oh, damn, who could be calling
at this hour?

33
00:01:38,724 --> 00:01:40,852
Wow, you certainly don't see

34
00:01:40,851 --> 00:01:43,195
six-and-a-half karat gold
every day.

35
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:44,859
Daphne, it's Roz.
Hello?

36
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,608
Quick, turn on your TV.
My building's on the news. What?

37
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:48,951
Some murder-suicide thing.

38
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,740
I'm going to wave to you
from my balcony.

39
00:01:50,736 --> 00:01:52,454
Darn, I'm not home.

40
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:54,115
Where are you?
You're not going to believe this,

41
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:57,998
w. hut Niles and I flew to Reno and
we're getting married right now

42
00:01:58,327 --> 00:01:59,249
You are not!

43
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:00,496
I am so.

44
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:03,339
(high-pitched screams)

45
00:02:03,332 --> 00:02:06,632
Apparently, it's some
sort of dolphin emergency

46
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:08,004
I should go.

47
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:09,505
I'll tell you everything
when we get back.

48
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:10,426
Okay, bye.

49
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:13,175
(sighs)
Ooh.

50
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:15,556
Sorry

51
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:18,055
You may exchange rings
as a symbol

52
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:20,558
of the promises
you've made here today.

53
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:28,190
(soft laughter)

54
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,658
By the power
vested in me

55
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:33,530
by the State of Nevada,
County of Washoe,

56
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:37,032
and the all-new Lucky Seven
Resort and Casino,

57
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:38,955
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

58
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:41,704
Good luck.

59
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:44,673
(piped-in bells ringing)

60
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:48,051
Hey, don't forget to check out
our topless buffet.

61
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:54,592
He never said,
"You may kiss the bride."

62
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:56,593
You may kiss the bride

63
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:08,981
(keys jangling)

64
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:09,981
Chop, chop, Dad.

65
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:11,449
Let's get a move on.

66
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:13,489
Last time I was late
for the Farmer's Market,

67
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:16,329
I got the worst
of the squash blossoms.

68
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:18,115
Oh, whatever shall we serve
the duchess?

69
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:19,457
What?

70
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:20,708
I said, "I'm coming."

71
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:22,620
And it's not my fault I'm late,
it's Daphne's.

72
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:23,620
S.
l don't know where she is.

73
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,122
I had to make my own lunch.

74
00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:27,716
Oh, dear Lord.
Give it here.

75
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:36,467
Two bags of chips,
three puddin' cups,

76
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,343
and a root beer.

77
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:39,640
H it?
What's wrong with it?

78
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:40,516
A: this is not a lunch,

79
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:43,014
and B: I fail to see
how it took you so long

80
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:44,516
since you did not
make anything

81
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:47,360
but simply transferred smaller
containers into a larger one.

82
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:48,486
Let's go.

83
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:51,239
Oh, uh...
Oh!

84
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,153
Hello, all. Hi.
Hello, all.

85
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:53,150
Where have you been?

86
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,151
I had to make my own lunch

87
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:55,152
Oh...

88
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:57,529
We've got some big news.

89
00:03:57,529 --> 00:03:58,530
Yes, um...

90
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,407
Maybe they should sit down.
Oh, yes.

91
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:01,659
What's going on?

92
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:02,534
DAPHNE : Well..

93
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:04,040
Last night I told Niles

94
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:06,538
that I wanted to
marry him right then and there

95
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:08,419
NILES: And once I realized she
was serious,

96
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,759
we rushed out into the night
fully intending to.

97
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:12,253
But then we found
out that in Washington

98
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,254
it takes three days to
get a marriage license.

99
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,632
Thank goodness

100
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:17,599
Why?

101
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:18,842
"wHY"?

102
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:20,602
If we had missed
your wedding,

103
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:22,392
well, it would have
just killed me.

104
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:23,639
It would have?

105
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:26,141
Oh, of course
it would.

106
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:27,608
Niles, we've been there

107
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:30,605
through the last ten tortured
years of your courtship.

108
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:33,528
How could we not be hurt
if we missed the wedding?

109
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:35,905
But surely you could
understand if...

110
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:40,532
If someone were carried away
by their emotions.

111
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:43,033
Because it would have just
broken my heart.

112
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,419
We came here to tell you

113
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:56,763
that there's a wedding
in three days!

114
00:04:56,755 --> 00:04:57,631
Oh, well...

115
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:59,133
Isn't that big news?

116
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,008
Yes.

117
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:01,430
We're going to have a...

118
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:03,428
A simple ceremony
at the courthouse.

119
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:04,930
That is just wonderful.

120
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:05,931
And you know what?

121
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:07,433
By way of a celebration,

122
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:09,901
please allow me
to treat us all to dinner

123
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:11,816
at Coeur du Singe.
How does that sound, huh?

124
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:12,813
That sounds wonderful.

125
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:13,814
(doorbell rings)

126
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:14,815
Hey, Martin.

127
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,316
Hey, how are
you doing?

128
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,818
Want to go
to the dog park?

129
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:19,195
Oh, my God,
you guys are here.

130
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:22,163
(joyous yells)

131
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:25,451
Well, I'm here, too.

132
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,293
Um, we were just talking
about our wedding.

133
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:29,162
Oh, good, I want to hear
all about it.

134
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:31,456
We're going to have a small
civil ceremony on Friday

135
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:34,338
(yells)
Huh?

136
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,211
Yes, if you'll excuse me,

137
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:39,215
I'm in a rush to get
to the Farmer's Market.

138
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:40,215
NILES: At this hour?

139
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:43,434
I hope you like
listless radicchio.

140
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:44,685
Okay, what the hell?

141
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,976
I thought you guys
got married in Reno.

142
00:05:47,222 --> 00:05:48,815
We did, but
as we were trying

143
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:51,310
to tell Mr. Crane
and Dr. Crane,

144
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:53,607
they told us how hurt they'd be
if we got married without them.

145
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:55,814
NILES: Yes, yes, which in the
moment, failed to occur to us.

146
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:57,608
So, to spare their feelings,

147
00:05:57,607 --> 00:06:00,577
we're having a fake wedding
on Friday.

148
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:01,946
Well, that works for me

149
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:04,448
because Alice is still
counting on being a flower girl.

150
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,449
Of course.
Great.

151
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:07,959
So, if you guys
have two weddings,

152
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:09,373
when's your anniversary
going to be?

153
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,747
Well, I suppose
to keep up appearances,

154
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:14,249
it'll have to be
the second one, won't it?

155
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:16,251
Well, could celebrate
two anniversaries.

156
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:18,253
A public on; and then a

157
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:22,258
second, secret
one just for us.

158
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:25,261
Ooh, I like that.

159
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,262
Sort of sexy
having an anniversary

160
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:29,139
only the two of us
know about.

161
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:32,021
Three of us.

162
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:35,024
I still can't believe
we're married.

163
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,897
It's our
one-day anniversary.

164
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:40,743
And we're the only ones
who know.

165
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:44,746
You know,
we should celebrate.

166
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:46,740
L-[ow about going
to the dog park?

167
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,742
That doesn't sound
very romantic.

168
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:50,244
I'm not talking to you.

169
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,673
NILES:
Nervous?

170
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:01,171
DAPHNE:
Less than last time.

171
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:03,173
Al. I guess it helps to
have had a rehearsal

172
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:05,141
That wasn't a rehearsal;
it was the real thing.

173
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:08,557
This is just
a touring company performance.

174
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:10,055
Right.

175
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:14,560
It's a bloody miracle
we're here in one piece

176
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,562
what with the way you drive.

177
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:20,065
I'm better at it when someone's
not screaming in my ear.

178
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:23,069
Well, in my day, people
didn't drive so recklessly.

179
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:24,445
Do you know why?

180
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:27,948
Is it because
you rode dinosaurs?

181
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,077
You should talk
to your daughter.

182
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:36,961
When we get home,
you're getting ice cream.

183
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:42,591
Why did we all
have to

184
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:44,089
just to pick up
a bloody license?

185
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:45,557
Couldn't we have met
at the church?

186
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:46,970
Mum, we aren't going
to the church.

187
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:48,219
We're getting married here.

188
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:49,970
You're what?

189
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,847
We're having
a civil ceremony

190
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:53,223
Without a minister?

191
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:54,600
Out of the question.

192
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:55,976
Mum...
That's enough, Daphne.

193
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:59,856
I am your mother and I will not
bear witness to a godless union.

194
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:02,733
Gertrude, I favor a
church wedding, too.

195
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:04,734
But this is their day,
not ours.

196
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:07,112
Maybe we should just let them
decide how it's going to be.

197
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,615
If people gut to decide things
for themselves,

198
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:12,083
no one would go to church.

199
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:13,577
If I may...

200
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:16,329
I'll handle this,
Your Honor.

201
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,501
Mrs. Moon...

202
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,000
You have my personal guarantee

203
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,345
that this will not be a
godless union.

204
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:26,510
For if you
truly believe

205
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:32,013
in the omniscience
and omnipresence of the Lord,

206
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:36,813
then surely are we not always
in His presence?

207
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:39,061
No, He lives at the church.

208
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:43,023
All I'm asking is

209
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,943
that you honor the wishes
of an old woman

210
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:49,037
whose every child has been
married by a minister--

211
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:51,407
or at least a prison chaplain.

212
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:53,784
Perhaps given the depth
of feeling here,

213
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:55,285
it would be best to wait.

214
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:57,287
Well, I suppose we
could find a church

215
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:58,789
in reasonably
short order.

216
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,085
I don't believe this.

217
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:01,833
Well, if you're
not going to get married now,

218
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,835
perhaps you could all
take this into the hall.

219
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:05,212
I have a schedule to keep.

220
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:06,713
Roz, take me home.

221
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:08,840
We'll call you when
we've cleared this up.

222
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,183
Ice.
Okay. Let's go, Al

223
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:11,551
Congratulations.

224
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:17,683
When you're ready to have
a proper wedding,

225
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,434
you know where to find me.

226
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:21,069
That we do.

227
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:24,947
On your fiery throne
presiding over the damned!

228
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:26,362
All right,
let's-let's go.

229
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:28,360
Where are we going
to find a clergyman

230
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,112
who will perform
on such short notice?

231
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:31,863
Hey, maybe the judge
knows somebody.

232
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:32,864
Hang on a second, you guys

233
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:33,865
Your Honor

234
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:35,491
I'm sorry, Daphne,

235
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:37,369
but it'll just be few days
and then we can be married.

236
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:38,745
We already are.

237
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:42,249
This is supposed to be the
happiest time of my life

238
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,216
I want to wear
my wedding ring.

239
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:45,256
I'm Mrs. Niles Crane,

240
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:48,005
and I don't want
to keep it a secret.

241
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:49,847
You just want to tell them
the truth?

242
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,341
Too complicated.

243
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:52,638
Let's just
get married again.

244
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:54,011
The wedding's on.

245
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,012
What? What about Mrs. Moon?

246
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:57,889
I'm sorry she'll miss it,
but that's her choice.

247
00:09:57,889 --> 00:09:59,357
Your Honor, we've
changed our minds.

248
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:00,646
We want to be married.

249
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:02,519
Oh, all right, but we have to be
quick about this.

250
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:03,520
Are we ready to begin?

251
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,737
Yes.
Yes.

252
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:06,276
JUDGE: Okay, let's do it.

253
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,024
Daphne, please repeat after me.

254
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:10,118
Actually, we've written
our own vows.

255
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,407
Of course you have.

256
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:17,664
I, Daphne Moon, do take thee,
Niles Crane, as my husband.

257
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:21,630
I promise you my fidelity
and my support...

258
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:22,998
My laughter and my tears...

259
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:25,876
You said you wouldn't
do this.

260
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,378
...my constant friendship...
I say a Int of things.

261
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,801
(chuckling)

262
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,303
Oh, Frasier, thank you
so much for dinner.

263
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:38,680
Yes, it was wonderful.

264
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,648
It was my pleasure.

265
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:44,645
Dad, don't you have
something to add?

266
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,646
Well, I already said thank you
for dinner.

267
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,648
What am I supposed to do,
get down on my knees

268
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:52,573
and kowtow to your fancy-ass
American Express card?

269
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:54,571
No...

270
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:57,916
I was referring to the gift
we have for them.

271
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:59,159
Oh, right!

272
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,160
I forgot about that.

273
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,458
Yeah, and thanks
for dinner, Frasier.

274
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:04,296
It really was excellent.

275
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:07,168
And I didn't think I'd
like beef cheeks...

276
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:09,420
Yes, yes, Dad,
give them the gift. I...

277
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:12,843
This is so exciting-
our first wedding present.

278
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:18,846
Oh, it's a silver
picture frame.

279
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:20,347
Beautiful.

280
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:21,347
And,nota hene,

281
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:24,351
it's been engraved
with today's date.

282
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,352
In order to commemorate
your wedding day

283
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,354
until your real gift
arrives.

284
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:29,355
Oh, it's very sweet.

285
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,323
Thank you Mr. Crane
and Dr. Crane.

286
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:34,195
Well, you can't call us that anymore.

287
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:36,117
We're family now.

288
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:37,488
So we are.

289
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:40,992
Well, thank you... Frasier.

290
00:11:40,992 --> 00:11:42,494
(laughing)

291
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:43,995
Oh, that feels strange.

292
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:45,872
And thank you...

293
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:47,465
Martin.
Dad?

294
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:48,629
Dad.

295
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:49,501
Or Martin.

296
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,877
Whatever makes
you comfortable.

297
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:53,221
Oh, thank you, Mr. Crane.

298
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:55,090
Don't mention it.

299
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,592
Well, I'd better go and figure out

300
00:11:57,592 --> 00:11:59,594
what to pack
for the honeymoon.

301
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:06,602
I'm just bringing sunscreen.

302
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,738
Pardon me.

303
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:15,031
I have to go poke out
my mind's eye.

304
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:18,871
Ah, you're lucky.

305
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:20,991
I always wanted to go
to Bora Bora.

306
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,788
Oh, it's going
to be fantastic, Dad.

307
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:25,537
We're staying in a thatched hut
built out over the water.

308
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:27,413
In the middle of the floor,
there's a window

309
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:29,757
where you can look straight down
to the bottom of the ocean.

310
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,046
Oh, well, I hope it's not ton deep.

311
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:33,044
When we went to the top
of the Space Needle

312
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:34,887
and you looked down,
you got sick.

313
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:36,552
Dad...

314
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:39,551
All over that poor
Japanese tour group.

315
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:41,261
Dad.

316
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:46,558
(doorbell

317
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:50,562
That was three years ago.

318
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:53,064
Mrs. Moon.

319
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:54,566
Did you find
a minister yet?

320
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:56,067
No.
I'm sorry,

321
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:56,943
Actually..

322
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:58,195
Good, then I'm not too late.

323
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:02,700
Too late for what?

324
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:10,083
When I got home
this afternoon...

325
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:12,334
And I began thinking:

326
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:15,212
I was married by a minister
in a church,

327
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:16,713
and what's it got me?

328
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:18,718
Alone and unloved is what.

329
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:22,219
And likely because I've been such
a rotten mother

330
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:23,720
to you all these years.

331
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,597
You haven't been rotten.

332
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:26,973
Oh, yes, I have.

333
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:29,101
On what should've been the happiest
day of your life,

334
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,602
I thought of only myself.

335
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:36,608
I'm ashamed, I'm, I mean,
I'm embarrassed.

336
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:38,484
And I apologize.

337
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,452
Oh, Mum.

338
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:42,243
Oh.
(frying)

339
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:46,994
Oh, my only solace is
you aren't married yet.

340
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:49,329
Because if I missed

341
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:51,127
my baby's wedding,

342
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:53,625
I wouldn't be able
to live with myself.

343
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:55,627
Daphne...

344
00:13:56,502 --> 00:14:01,508
Niles...

345
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:05,012
You get married
any way you want to.

346
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:08,766
All that matters is that
I'm thereto share it with you

347
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:10,517
Of course you'll be there.

348
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:13,019
(Crying)

349
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:18,024
We'll go right back

350
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,026
to that courthouse tomorrow

351
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:22,028
and resume where
we left off.

352
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:23,905
Oh, nothing could make me
happier.

353
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,873
Ah, Mrs. Moon.

354
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,788
I see you've made peace
with the wedding.

355
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:29,661
Yes, Mrs. Moon
has rescinded her ultimatum

356
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:33,540
so we're having
the wedding tomorrow.

357
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,007
Ah.

358
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:37,001
Niles, may I have a word
with you?

359
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:38,378
NILES:Mm-hmm.

360
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:39,675
Excuse me.

361
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:43,015
What the hell is going on?

362
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:44,008
You guys already
got married.

363
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:46,011
Yes, but she doesn't
know that, so tomorrow

364
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:48,513
we're going to have another
ceremony for her benefit.

365
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:49,889
That's crazy.

366
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:52,183
It may be, but I'm afraid
the truth would crush her.

367
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:53,685
Oh, please

368
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:56,062
All the winepresses in Bordeaux
wouldn't crush that woman.

369
00:14:58,189 --> 00:15:00,658
Niles, what you and Daphne
shared today was utterly unique.

370
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:03,073
You think so?

371
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:04,571
Yes, it was a singular moment.

372
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,572
Anyone fooled
by a repeat performance

373
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,415
would have to be
a complete imbecile.

374
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:13,204
True.

375
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:16,083
But if it's what Daphne wants,
I'll support her.

376
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:18,210
We'll get Roz back,
we'll find a different judge,

377
00:15:18,543 --> 00:15:20,591
and we'll just do it
all over again.

378
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:23,931
And... it'll be just as perfect
as today's was.

379
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,220
Fine.

380
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:27,218
But I'm not singing
"Wonderful World" again.

381
00:15:27,218 --> 00:15:29,596
(gasping):
Maybe more perfect.

382
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:34,434
Remember how
excited we were

383
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:36,937
at our first wedding?

384
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:39,439
Yeah, we were both shaking.

385
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:40,861
Yeah.

386
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:43,234
Hey, I noticed
the first time,

387
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:46,238
you promised me your honesty
and protection,

388
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:48,239
but not the second time.

389
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:51,622
No, because I vowed
to, uh, always be true

390
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:54,621
and to be your
constant champion.

391
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,122
It's the same thing.

392
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:57,123
I suppose.

393
00:15:57,623 --> 00:16:00,001
You liked it better the first way?

394
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:02,379
Okay, we can go back to that.

395
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:04,881
Thanks.

396
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:07,384
You making
any changes?

397
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:09,852
Nope. Same old, same old.

398
00:16:10,261 --> 00:16:11,729
.. J'J'
N Dah, dah, dah, dah.

399
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:13,598
Where's Alice?

400
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:14,974
Oh, upset stomach.

401
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,476
On the way home yesterday,

402
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:18,524
she snacked on t he leftover
petals in her basket.

403
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,021
Ble So, I'm sorry, but I won't be a

404
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:21,272
to join you for dinner

405
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:23,028
We understand.

406
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:24,401
Explain it to me then.

407
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,402
What sort of child eats roses?

408
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:27,278
This isn't normal

409
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:29,246
ROZ: You could've
stopped her, you know.

410
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:32,163
Not the way she was gnashing
them up, I couldn't.

411
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:34,661
Like a wood chipper, she was.

412
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,661
All right.

413
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:38,164
The incredible beaver baby.

414
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:39,507
We get it.

415
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:40,291
Oh, dear Lord

416
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:41,792
ls that Donny?

417
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:43,294
Everybody, look at your shoes.

418
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:44,796
Wait a minute.

419
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:46,797
Daph... is that Daphne?

420
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:48,799
Hi.
Donny.

421
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:49,800
What a surprise.

422
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,801
L-Ii, everybody.

423
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:52,804
Boy, I hope this isn't
uncomfortable.

424
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:54,806
Oh, no, no,
not at all

425
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:57,809
Uh, say, is that
a drinking fountain over there?

426
00:16:58,309 --> 00:16:59,652
Sure looks
like one.

427
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,812
Well, Niles,

428
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:04,315
Daphne, I'd like you to meet
Bridget, my fiance.

429
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:05,862
Hi.
Hello.

430
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:08,156
We just filed
for our marriage license.

431
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:09,029
Congratulations.

432
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:10,872
That's great.
Thank you.

433
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,661
I know that
I was getting married

434
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:14,125
last time you ran into me,

435
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:15,993
but this time I found
the real thing.

436
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:17,666
Good, I'm glad.
Yeah.

437
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,664
You know,
if you hadn't left me,

438
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:21,666
then I never would've met
my ex-wife

439
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:23,168
who introduced me
to Bridget.

440
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:25,670
So, in a weird way,
you played a big part

441
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:26,546
in my eventual happiness.

442
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:28,051
That's a very
healthy perspective.

443
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,048
DONNY:
I think so, too.

444
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,927
So, what are you guys
doing here?

445
00:17:31,926 --> 00:17:35,305
Niles and I
are getting married.

446
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:37,056
Well, congratulations.

447
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,308
That is great.

448
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:39,274
(chuckling)

449
00:17:39,684 --> 00:17:41,277
Daphne.
Thank you.

450
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:42,270
Yes, well,
it's great.

451
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:43,772
And it's nice
seeing you.

452
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:45,569
And I hope you come
to our wedding.

453
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:47,317
Oh, same here.

454
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:49,694
Really, you'd be okay
with that?

455
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:54,199
Well, sure. Why not?

456
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:56,200
Of course, it's anybody's guess

457
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:59,079
how long we could be waiting here.

458
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,831
You can come in now.

459
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:04,584
Who had one second?

460
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:06,052
Uh, everyone, it's time

461
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:07,545
Oh, well, here we go, then.

462
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:08,546
This is Bridget.

463
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:10,047
Oh, lovely to meet you.

464
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:10,923
Hi,
nice to meet you.

465
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,345
Hi. Hi.

466
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:13,342
Hi.
Hi.

467
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:15,219
Hi, how you doing?

468
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:18,598
Is this everybody?

469
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:19,565
Yes.

470
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:21,226
JUDGE: Let's get started.

471
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:23,102
We come here today to unite

472
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,480
this man and this woman
in marriage.

473
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:27,448
I understand
Daphne and Niles

474
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,362
have composed vows

475
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:31,737
that are especially significant
to them. Niles.

476
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:33,738
Yeah.
(clears throat)

477
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:35,740
Uh, I, Niles Crane,

478
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:40,246
take you, Daphne Moon,
to be my wife.

479
00:18:40,745 --> 00:18:45,251
I-I vow to you my-
my fidelity and support,

480
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:49,254
honor, respect, uh, honesty...

481
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:50,630
Protection

482
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:55,719
...and support

483
00:18:55,968 --> 00:19:00,519
Uh... you are my comfort
and joy and, oh...

484
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:03,984
Shoot, there's one more, uh..

485
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:05,770
One true love.

486
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,112
One true love.

487
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:08,606
That's right,
that's right.

488
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:10,904
Go.
Okay, you

489
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,653
"Okay, you go"?

490
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:20,501
I, Daphne:"Moon, do

491
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:22,996
I'm sorry,
this is wrong.

492
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,498
I can't stand here
and rattle off a bunch of words

493
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:27,500
that don't mean anything
anymore.

494
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,002
I'm can't go through
with this.

495
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,002
DONNY:
Yes!

496
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,504
I knew it!

497
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:32,756
Now you know what it's like

498
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:35,391
to have the love of your life
dump you at the altar.

499
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:37,806
And good luck trying to find
somebody as good

500
00:19:37,802 --> 00:19:39,645
because she just
ain't out there.

501
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:45,685
What?

502
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:46,937
No, no

503
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:48,688
No, Bridget!

504
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:50,690
Bridget!
(door closes)

505
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:54,194
I'm sorry, everyone,
but Niles and I,

506
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,070
we're already married.

507
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:57,446
What?

508
00:19:57,822 --> 00:19:58,823
Mrs. Moon, I'm afraid it's
true.

509
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:00,700
Uh, Niles and Daphne
are already married,

510
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,828
and they were simply trying
to spare your feelings.

511
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,037
You knew about Reno?

512
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,789
FRASIER: I was talking
about yesterday.

513
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:08,211
What happened in Reno?

514
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,959
They gut married
yesterday?

515
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:11,552
This is all a lie?

516
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:13,342
No, yesterday was a lie.
We eloped last week.

517
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:14,304
I thought you had

518
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:15,714
to wait for the license.

519
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:16,967
That's why we went to Reno.

520
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:17,970
Why didn't you tell us?

521
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,059
We thought you'd be insulted.

522
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,849
I'm insulted now!

523
00:20:20,845 --> 00:20:23,223
How could you tell Roz
and not your own family?!

524
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,690
How could you have two weddings

525
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:25,558
without telling your mother
about one?

526
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:26,730
How could you
cheat Alice

527
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:29,570
out of being
a flower girl?

528
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:31,485
We just wanted
to be married.

529
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,359
Hold on, I got a question here.

530
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:36,861
You've been married
for a week...

531
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:39,830
How come you're not
on your honeymoon?

532
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,585
Thank you... Martin.

533
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,082
I hope you can all forgive us.

534
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,583
Of course.
Well, of course we can. Of course.

535
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,085
Your happiness, that
's what's important.

536
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:53,882
This is such a relief.

537
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:55,258
It just felt wrong

538
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,598
to start off
a marriage with a lie.

539
00:20:57,882 --> 00:21:00,385
Was the first one
at least in from of a minister?

540
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:02,387
of course
Yes, let's go.

541
00:21:09,143 --> 00:21:11,145
 Hey, baby, I hear
the blues a-calling 

542
00:21:11,145 --> 00:21:13,989
 Tossed salads
and scrambled eggs 

543
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:15,904
 on, my 

544
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,277
 And maybe I seem
a bit confused 

545
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:21,372
 Well, maybe,
but I got you pegged 

546
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:22,865
(laughs)

547
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:24,867
 But I don't know what to do


548
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:28,667
 With those tossed salad
 and scrambled eggs 

549
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:31,506
 They're calling again


550
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:33,922
Good night!
