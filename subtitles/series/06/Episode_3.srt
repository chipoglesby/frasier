1
00:00:08,407 --> 00:00:09,574
So when's Freddie coming in?

2
00:00:09,783 --> 00:00:12,327
He's arriving in a few hours.
I'm picking him up at the airport.

3
00:00:12,536 --> 00:00:14,204
Gosh, you know,
I'm so excited to see him.

4
00:00:14,454 --> 00:00:16,998
And it was Lilith's turn this year
to have him for his birthday,

5
00:00:17,207 --> 00:00:19,084
but apparently
there was an accident at the lab.

6
00:00:19,292 --> 00:00:21,253
One of her monkeys bit her
on the tongue.

7
00:00:22,128 --> 00:00:23,964
What exactly was she doing
with the monkey?

8
00:00:25,507 --> 00:00:27,592
She's was teaching them
sign language.

9
00:00:27,968 --> 00:00:30,095
I guess one of them
made a disparaging remark

10
00:00:30,262 --> 00:00:31,513
about her new haircut.

11
00:00:31,721 --> 00:00:33,848
She stuck her tongue out.

12
00:00:35,058 --> 00:00:37,185
Wow, how bad
does a haircut have to be

13
00:00:37,394 --> 00:00:39,854
for a monkey to hate it?

14
00:00:40,146 --> 00:00:42,816
Well, I guess I'm just gonna have
to get myself a cup of coffee.

15
00:00:42,982 --> 00:00:46,361
Oh, somebody dropped a wallet.

16
00:00:46,945 --> 00:00:48,404
Is he cute?

17
00:00:48,655 --> 00:00:50,532
It's hard to tell
from a driver's license photo,

18
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:54,619
but he is 5-foot-6, weighs 200 pounds,
and has corrective lenses.

19
00:00:54,828 --> 00:00:56,871
Leave it on the floor.

20
00:00:58,164 --> 00:01:01,459
Well, thank God I don't share
your good-deeds-for-hunks-only policy.

21
00:01:02,835 --> 00:01:03,836
Excuse me,

22
00:01:04,003 --> 00:01:06,589
- I found this on the floor...
- Is that my wallet you got there?

23
00:01:06,756 --> 00:01:08,716
Is it? Well, I found it
on the floor over there.

24
00:01:08,883 --> 00:01:10,551
I was about to drop it
off at the counter.

25
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,470
Please, no reward.

26
00:01:12,679 --> 00:01:14,931
- What happened to my cash?
- Well, I don't know.

27
00:01:15,098 --> 00:01:16,349
It was empty when I found it.

28
00:01:16,516 --> 00:01:19,560
Yeah, right.
I had seven bucks in here.

29
00:01:19,769 --> 00:01:22,230
Well, I'm sure some lucky thief
is off enjoying a matinee

30
00:01:22,397 --> 00:01:24,440
and a small soda.

31
00:01:24,774 --> 00:01:28,111
At least you left my credit card. Jerk.

32
00:01:29,612 --> 00:01:31,572
Would you please bring me
my usual?

33
00:01:32,532 --> 00:01:34,075
Can you believe that guy?

34
00:01:34,283 --> 00:01:36,410
I do him a favour,
he accuses me of stealing.

35
00:01:36,619 --> 00:01:38,871
Oh, please.
The world is full of creeps like that.

36
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,414
Haven't you figured that out yet?

37
00:01:40,623 --> 00:01:44,001
I'm sorry, Roz, but I still believe
that people are basically good.

38
00:01:45,544 --> 00:01:47,171
Hey, guys, I'm glad you're here.

39
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:50,675
- I need to talk to you about something.
- What can I do for you, Bulldog?

40
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:52,968
My mom's having bypass surgery
tomorrow morning,

41
00:01:53,135 --> 00:01:56,013
and I'd like to sit up with her tonight
at the hospital.

42
00:01:56,263 --> 00:01:58,682
But I gotta work the 11 -to-1 spot.

43
00:01:58,891 --> 00:02:00,184
I don't suppose you'd think...

44
00:02:00,392 --> 00:02:04,647
Oh, right. Like we don't know
there's a big fight in Vegas tonight.

45
00:02:04,897 --> 00:02:08,150
Look, I know I've jerked you guys
around before, but this is serious.

46
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,443
Bulldog, I'm sorry.

47
00:02:09,652 --> 00:02:11,946
Frederick's coming in tonight.
It's his birthday.

48
00:02:12,404 --> 00:02:16,116
Okay, doc. Never mind.
I understand.

49
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:19,370
Hello, Bernice Brisco's room,
please.

50
00:02:19,578 --> 00:02:22,706
I hope my mom's around
to celebrate her next birthday.

51
00:02:23,248 --> 00:02:25,376
Hi, Mom, it's Bobby.

52
00:02:26,669 --> 00:02:28,921
Look, I'm gonna have to
work tonight after all.

53
00:02:29,171 --> 00:02:31,006
Bulldog, wait a minute.
You know what?

54
00:02:31,256 --> 00:02:34,218
Frederick will be asleep by 11:00.
I guess we could take your slot.

55
00:02:34,426 --> 00:02:36,553
Are you insane?
How can you be so gullible?

56
00:02:36,762 --> 00:02:38,889
He is not talking to his mother.

57
00:02:39,431 --> 00:02:42,768
Does somebody have a boo-boo
on her heart?

58
00:02:44,686 --> 00:02:46,188
Is someone gonna have
to open you up

59
00:02:46,355 --> 00:02:49,608
with those big old rib spreaders?

60
00:02:51,193 --> 00:02:54,321
Oh, Mrs. Brisco, I'm so sorry.

61
00:02:56,198 --> 00:02:59,368
Listen, I just wanted you to know
that we'll fill in for Bobby tonight.

62
00:02:59,534 --> 00:03:01,286
Thanks a million, you guys.

63
00:03:01,453 --> 00:03:05,791
- I'd better get back to the hospital.
- God bless, Bulldog.

64
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:09,336
Oh, I can't believe I said that.
That poor woman.

65
00:03:09,544 --> 00:03:11,380
- We're outta here.
- Our flight doesn't leave

66
00:03:11,546 --> 00:03:13,882
- for another two hours.
- I gotta stop by my mom's first.

67
00:03:14,049 --> 00:03:16,134
I owe her 50 bucks
and case of Schlitz.

68
00:03:38,156 --> 00:03:39,616
Should I even ask?

69
00:03:39,991 --> 00:03:42,077
These balloons come
in an unsealed package,

70
00:03:42,243 --> 00:03:44,412
covered with some mysterious dust,

71
00:03:44,579 --> 00:03:46,664
straight from some
Southeast Asian sweatshop.

72
00:03:46,831 --> 00:03:49,125
- Doesn't that worry you?
- Oh, you bet it does.

73
00:03:49,334 --> 00:03:51,836
I remember back in Korea
we'd crouch in our foxholes

74
00:03:52,003 --> 00:03:55,799
scared to death those bastards
were gonna drop balloons on us.

75
00:03:57,425 --> 00:03:59,093
The doorman called.
They're on their way.

76
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:01,471
Don't know how much
of a surprise it's gonna be anyway.

77
00:04:01,679 --> 00:04:03,932
- You did the same thing last year.
- That's the point.

78
00:04:04,098 --> 00:04:06,100
He'd never suspect
I'd do it two years in a row.

79
00:04:06,351 --> 00:04:09,062
I must say I feel a bit bad for Freddie.
None of his mates are here,

80
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:11,773
just the three of us old fogies
yelling "Surprise."

81
00:04:12,023 --> 00:04:14,317
Any party that he's at with you
is gonna be a treat for him.

82
00:04:14,525 --> 00:04:15,777
He's got a little crush on you.

83
00:04:16,027 --> 00:04:17,820
If you really want Frederick
to enjoy himself,

84
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:21,074
he especially likes you
in that little blue cocktail dress.

85
00:04:23,284 --> 00:04:26,204
I'm not sure that dress is appropriate
for a child's birthday party.

86
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:29,540
Well, it's hardly a party.
It's just us fogies.

87
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:33,002
You know, Frederick, your granddad
really wanted to be here,

88
00:04:33,211 --> 00:04:36,339
but he had an important
Rotary Club meeting.

89
00:04:36,881 --> 00:04:39,967
- What?
- Not another surprise party.

90
00:04:41,469 --> 00:04:44,222
- What are you talking about?
- Just like last year.

91
00:04:44,472 --> 00:04:48,142
Oh, Lord, all right, all right,
I'll tell you what, just don't let on, okay?

92
00:04:48,392 --> 00:04:51,479
You know how he loves this stuff.
Just act surprised, all right?

93
00:04:51,646 --> 00:04:53,397
The hardest thing
is pretending to be fooled

94
00:04:53,564 --> 00:04:55,983
- by the trick candles.
- Oh, gosh.

95
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:58,986
You think it's hard now,
wait until you're my age.

96
00:05:00,488 --> 00:05:02,406
Surprise!

97
00:05:02,656 --> 00:05:05,826
- Oh, wow! I'm so surprised.
- You see? I told you.

98
00:05:05,993 --> 00:05:08,621
- Hey, Freddie.
- How are you doing? Happy birthday.

99
00:05:08,829 --> 00:05:10,998
- Hi.
- Hi!

100
00:05:11,165 --> 00:05:13,083
Happy birthday, sweetheart.

101
00:05:13,417 --> 00:05:15,711
Just let me get the phone.

102
00:05:17,505 --> 00:05:19,006
Hello?

103
00:05:19,173 --> 00:05:20,925
Yes, who's calling, please?

104
00:05:21,091 --> 00:05:22,551
Wewef?

105
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,219
Anyone here know a Wewef?

106
00:05:24,929 --> 00:05:26,555
Oh, Lilith.

107
00:05:29,183 --> 00:05:30,809
Yes, hello, Lilith.

108
00:05:31,185 --> 00:05:33,395
What's that?
Oh, right, yes, of course he's here.

109
00:05:33,687 --> 00:05:36,231
It's your mom. Why don't you take it
into your granddad's room?

110
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,776
- Okay. Hi, Mom.
- Let's get the cake ready.

111
00:05:38,942 --> 00:05:40,444
Oh, yes, yes. Oh, Frasier,

112
00:05:40,611 --> 00:05:42,738
I think you're going to be
pleasantly surprised.

113
00:05:44,615 --> 00:05:47,409
<i>- Voila!
- What the hell is that?</i>

114
00:05:47,618 --> 00:05:50,954
It's Louis Pasteur,
Freddie's favorite scientist.

115
00:05:52,372 --> 00:05:54,666
What child wouldn't be thrilled
with a coconut death mask

116
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:56,877
on his birthday?

117
00:05:57,794 --> 00:05:59,713
Frasier,
what happened to your jacket?

118
00:05:59,963 --> 00:06:02,758
Oh, at the airport, I helped this woman
get her dog into her car.

119
00:06:02,966 --> 00:06:05,927
- Oh, I hope at least it was in a crate.
- Yes, very heavy crate.

120
00:06:06,136 --> 00:06:08,722
I had to hold it at arm's length
so that what I chose to believe

121
00:06:08,889 --> 00:06:11,391
was drool wouldn't run out
onto my shoes.

122
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,855
Eight blocks later I finally load
little Fido into her backseat,

123
00:06:17,064 --> 00:06:18,899
woman drives off
without so much as a thank-you

124
00:06:19,066 --> 00:06:20,984
or an offer to give me a ride
to the airport.

125
00:06:21,151 --> 00:06:23,487
I responded with the time-honored
gesture of disapproval,

126
00:06:23,653 --> 00:06:26,698
but on the upswing
I caught my finger on the jacket and...

127
00:06:26,907 --> 00:06:28,241
Oh, thank you.

128
00:06:28,742 --> 00:06:32,579
I must say my belief in people's basic
decency has taken a beating today.

129
00:06:32,746 --> 00:06:35,415
Earlier, I returned a man's wallet.
He accused me of stealing.

130
00:06:35,665 --> 00:06:37,459
Well, it just proves
what I always say,

131
00:06:37,667 --> 00:06:39,502
a good Samaritan
is nothing but a good target.

132
00:06:39,669 --> 00:06:42,047
I'm sorry, Dad, I'm not ready
to be quite that cynical yet.

133
00:06:42,255 --> 00:06:43,965
- He's off the phone.
- Oh, good. All right.

134
00:06:44,174 --> 00:06:45,425
You can believe what you want,

135
00:06:45,592 --> 00:06:49,679
but I think people are born rotten
and every year they get worse.

136
00:06:49,846 --> 00:06:53,349
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

137
00:06:55,018 --> 00:07:01,316
<i>Welcome back to the night-owl edition
of The Dr. Frasier Crane Show.</i>

138
00:07:01,775 --> 00:07:05,028
We have Stephen on line two.

139
00:07:05,361 --> 00:07:07,447
Go ahead, caller, you're on the air.

140
00:07:07,614 --> 00:07:09,324
<i>I think I'm losing my mind,
Dr. Crane.</i>

141
00:07:09,532 --> 00:07:12,702
<i>People are talking to me
through my radio.</i>

142
00:07:12,869 --> 00:07:16,122
<i>- Why do you think that?
- There it is again.</i>

143
00:07:20,043 --> 00:07:23,963
<i>- Turn your radio down.
- Now it's giving me orders.</i>

144
00:07:25,548 --> 00:07:27,467
Stephen, turn your radio down.

145
00:07:27,633 --> 00:07:30,595
<i>It knows my name.</i>

146
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:33,514
Stephen, listen to me,
this is your radio talking.

147
00:07:33,723 --> 00:07:36,267
I'm a very smart radio,
and I care about you,

148
00:07:36,476 --> 00:07:38,144
and I want you to turn me off.

149
00:07:38,311 --> 00:07:40,938
Go to bed and seek counselling
in the morning.

150
00:07:41,147 --> 00:07:42,398
<i>Okay.</i>

151
00:07:42,565 --> 00:07:45,359
<i>Sorry, doc, can't talk anymore.</i>

152
00:07:49,238 --> 00:07:52,408
Well, I'd like to end tonight
on a philosophical note.

153
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:55,953
You see, earlier today,
I helped some people.

154
00:07:56,162 --> 00:08:02,418
I returned a man's wallet,
and I aided a woman at the airport.

155
00:08:02,585 --> 00:08:03,878
And in return,

156
00:08:04,086 --> 00:08:09,884
I was accused of being a thief,
and my favourite jacket was ruined.

157
00:08:16,515 --> 00:08:19,393
I was so disappointed
by the events of the day

158
00:08:19,602 --> 00:08:21,562
that, on my way
to work here tonight,

159
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:24,190
I almost passed an elderly man
with a flat tire

160
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,650
without stopping to help him.

161
00:08:29,528 --> 00:08:31,030
What the hell are you doing?

162
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,365
I asked myself.

163
00:08:40,122 --> 00:08:43,500
How would I feel
if I were in this man's position

164
00:08:43,709 --> 00:08:44,918
and no one stopped to help me?

165
00:08:45,127 --> 00:08:47,796
Well, I did pull over,
I helped the man,

166
00:08:47,963 --> 00:08:50,507
and frankly, it felt great.

167
00:08:50,716 --> 00:08:54,011
So without sounding preachy,
I would like to advise you all

168
00:08:54,219 --> 00:08:57,764
to do a good deed once in a while,

169
00:08:57,973 --> 00:09:02,519
if not for the sake of others,
but then, well, for your own sake.

170
00:09:02,728 --> 00:09:05,772
Thank you.
Now, let's go to station ID.

171
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:08,859
Roz, do you mind?

172
00:09:09,985 --> 00:09:12,404
What is your problem?
I'm getting ready for bed.

173
00:09:12,571 --> 00:09:14,656
Alice gets me up
at the crack of dawn.

174
00:09:14,823 --> 00:09:17,909
If I get all this taken care of,
I get an extra half hour of sleep.

175
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,620
Well, at least you spared me
the spectacle of flossing.

176
00:09:20,829 --> 00:09:23,373
Thanks for reminding me.
I had corn.

177
00:09:27,169 --> 00:09:28,920
And we're back.

178
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:33,091
It seems that we've got time
for one more call.

179
00:09:33,425 --> 00:09:36,761
Don't bother, Roz, I'll get it.

180
00:09:40,098 --> 00:09:43,518
Go ahead, caller.
This is Dr. Frasier Crane. I'm listening.

181
00:09:43,685 --> 00:09:45,562
<i>Hi, Dr. Crane, this is Ralph.</i>

182
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:47,522
<i>The guy whose tire
you changed tonight.</i>

183
00:09:47,689 --> 00:09:50,191
Ralph! Well,
what a wonderful surprise.

184
00:09:50,358 --> 00:09:53,361
Let me first say to our listeners,
this call was not solicited in any way.

185
00:09:53,528 --> 00:09:54,696
You go ahead, Ralph.

186
00:09:54,946 --> 00:09:57,449
<i>Dr. Crane, I was just wondering,
do you wear cuff links?</i>

187
00:09:57,615 --> 00:10:01,327
Well, yes, as a matter of fact, I do,
but there's no need to buy me a gift.

188
00:10:01,536 --> 00:10:04,831
<i>A gift? You scratched the hell out
of my paint job with those things.</i>

189
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:07,041
<i>You owe me money.</i>

190
00:10:07,542 --> 00:10:09,419
You can't be serious.

191
00:10:09,627 --> 00:10:11,379
How much damage
could cuff links do to a car

192
00:10:11,546 --> 00:10:15,466
whose side window consists
of duct tape and a Hefty bag?

193
00:10:15,633 --> 00:10:18,219
<i>Well, you'll find out
when my lawyer sends you the bill.</i>

194
00:10:18,386 --> 00:10:22,682
Let me remind you again, listeners,
that call was not solicited.

195
00:10:37,989 --> 00:10:39,282
<i>Oh, great.</i>

196
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:41,617
<i>Somebody else
in need of a good Samaritan.</i>

197
00:10:44,328 --> 00:10:47,540
<i>Maybe if I ignore her,
she'll stop waving.</i>

198
00:10:49,584 --> 00:10:52,879
<i>But what am I gonna do?
Just leave her standing in the rain?</i>

199
00:10:53,504 --> 00:10:56,424
<i>Then again,
every one of my good deeds today</i>

200
00:10:56,591 --> 00:10:59,510
<i>has ended up biting me in the butt.</i>

201
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:11,022
Such nasty weather.
May I offer you a ride?

202
00:11:11,188 --> 00:11:13,357
Oh, thank you.

203
00:11:20,448 --> 00:11:22,283
I didn't think anyone
was gonna stop tonight.

204
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:26,245
Well, chivalry may be on life support,
but it's not dead.

205
00:11:26,453 --> 00:11:28,664
- Oh, seat warmers.
- Yes, they're standard.

206
00:11:28,873 --> 00:11:31,417
There's a little control on the side
if you want more leg room.

207
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:33,794
- Now where can I take you?
- It's up to you.

208
00:11:33,961 --> 00:11:37,339
We can get a room
or we can do it here in the car.

209
00:11:40,301 --> 00:11:42,094
Oh, dear God.

210
00:11:42,303 --> 00:11:45,472
- You are a prostitute.
- How far do these go back?

211
00:11:46,056 --> 00:11:48,392
Look, I'm sorry.
There's been a mistake.

212
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:50,602
- Oh, don't be nervous, baby.
- I'm not nervous.

213
00:11:50,811 --> 00:11:54,106
- Would you please put your seat up?
- I'll put it any way you like it, honey.

214
00:11:54,314 --> 00:11:57,901
Stop talking to me that way.
For God's sake! All right, now please,

215
00:11:58,068 --> 00:12:00,571
I'm sorry about this misunderstanding,
but get out of my car.

216
00:12:00,737 --> 00:12:03,490
- Why the hell did you pick me up?
- I was trying to be a gentleman.

217
00:12:03,657 --> 00:12:05,117
Now get out.

218
00:12:05,576 --> 00:12:07,369
I'm not walking all the way
back to my corner.

219
00:12:07,578 --> 00:12:10,622
- Give me some money for a cab.
- All right, fine.

220
00:12:10,914 --> 00:12:13,750
Oh, Lord, I guess I must have left
my wallet at the station.

221
00:12:13,917 --> 00:12:15,752
How in the hell
were you going to pay for me?

222
00:12:16,003 --> 00:12:18,338
I wasn't going to pay for you!

223
00:12:18,505 --> 00:12:21,049
Oh, here's a $20 bill. Now get out.

224
00:12:21,925 --> 00:12:24,720
God. Get out. Get out.
Hurry, get out now.

225
00:12:24,928 --> 00:12:26,847
It's too late. They've seen us.

226
00:12:27,013 --> 00:12:28,974
I don't believe
this is happening to me.

227
00:12:32,769 --> 00:12:34,062
Hello, officer.

228
00:12:34,271 --> 00:12:35,939
Just how fast was I going?

229
00:12:36,523 --> 00:12:37,774
Hey, don't I know you?

230
00:12:38,024 --> 00:12:40,360
- No, no, I don't believe so.
- I'm not talking to you.

231
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:42,112
Didn't I bust you last week?

232
00:12:42,362 --> 00:12:46,116
Give me a break, buddy.
I'm trying to earn a living here.

233
00:12:51,705 --> 00:12:54,207
Was it really necessary
to take my belt and tie?

234
00:12:54,374 --> 00:12:56,751
Standard procedure.
It's for your own protection.

235
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,629
For God's sake,
you had me in the drunk tank.

236
00:12:59,796 --> 00:13:02,799
If I wanted to kill myself,
I would've taken a deep breath.

237
00:13:06,636 --> 00:13:09,013
- Frasier!
- Niles.

238
00:13:09,222 --> 00:13:12,684
You certainly took your sweet time.
I've been waiting here two hours.

239
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:14,018
Well, I'm sorry, Niles.

240
00:13:14,227 --> 00:13:16,604
I guess what with the pillow fight
in the holding tank

241
00:13:16,813 --> 00:13:19,107
and the pre-mug shot makeover,
time just got away from me.

242
00:13:19,315 --> 00:13:21,234
Will you stop it!

243
00:13:23,653 --> 00:13:26,531
Just bail me out of here. I can't stand
another minute in this place.

244
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:28,283
All right. Excuse me.

245
00:13:28,491 --> 00:13:32,036
If you could get our bill together,
we're ready to settle up here.

246
00:13:33,246 --> 00:13:34,747
It's 500 bucks.

247
00:13:34,998 --> 00:13:38,209
Five hundred... Frasier,
I don't have that kind of cash on me.

248
00:13:38,418 --> 00:13:39,711
Put it on your credit card.

249
00:13:40,002 --> 00:13:41,754
And have "bail" appear
on my statement?

250
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:44,215
Do you know the kind of junk mail
I would get...?

251
00:13:44,424 --> 00:13:45,758
Just do it.

252
00:13:46,092 --> 00:13:47,802
Okay.

253
00:13:48,511 --> 00:13:50,221
There you are.

254
00:13:51,097 --> 00:13:56,018
So, what happened? A prostitute?

255
00:13:56,769 --> 00:14:00,523
Please, I told you on the phone,
I didn't know she was a prostitute.

256
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:02,567
I saw a woman stranded in the rain.

257
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:05,611
Naturally, I offered her a ride.
Before I knew it,

258
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:09,740
I was handcuffed to this bench,
surrounded by this motley assortment

259
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:13,661
of other wrongfully accused
gentlemen.

260
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:20,668
- Sir, your card didn't go through.
- What?

261
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:23,921
That's right, Maris' lawyers
had my credit limit reduced.

262
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:25,131
Oh, no.

263
00:14:25,381 --> 00:14:27,424
Been so bad this week
when I went to the cheese shop

264
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:30,845
for their Around the World platter,
they cut me off at Luxembourg.

265
00:14:32,054 --> 00:14:33,931
Would you please call Dad
and get him down here?

266
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:35,683
All right. All right.

267
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:41,605
Yeah, Dad, hi.
My credit card was declined.

268
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:45,985
Well, we need yours. Yeah.
Well, right, yeah, I'll see you soon.

269
00:14:46,235 --> 00:14:48,696
This is intolerable.
It'll take him 20 minutes to get here.

270
00:14:48,904 --> 00:14:51,031
- No, no, he's waiting in the car.
- What?

271
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,658
Why didn't he come in?

272
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:55,285
Frasier, this was his old precinct.

273
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:58,163
When we pulled up outside,
I saw a look on his face I haven't seen

274
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:01,667
since he drove us home from our first
and only Little League game.

275
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:06,797
- Oh, Dad.
- Hey, hold it down, will you?

276
00:15:07,005 --> 00:15:09,800
Dad, I'm so sorry.
What happened was...

277
00:15:10,008 --> 00:15:12,386
No, I don't need to know.
I didn't come down here to judge.

278
00:15:12,594 --> 00:15:15,472
- You're my son, and I love you.
- Yes, for God's sakes, Dad, I didn't...

279
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:17,558
Why don't we pay up,
and get out of here, okay?

280
00:15:17,766 --> 00:15:19,059
- Hey, Marty.
- Hey, Fred.

281
00:15:19,268 --> 00:15:21,186
Listen, I wouldn't take this
too hard, Marty.

282
00:15:21,353 --> 00:15:23,021
You remember
Captain Petchesky's son

283
00:15:23,188 --> 00:15:25,023
turned out to be
the Colman Park pervert.

284
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:28,110
- Yeah, thanks.
- And Sergeant O'Brien's daughter

285
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,696
- does all them cable movies.
- Yeah, I heard.

286
00:15:30,862 --> 00:15:32,531
You can pick her out.
She's got his chin.

287
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:35,492
Yeah, could we just
get on with it here?

288
00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:38,078
Dad, will you let me explain?

289
00:15:38,286 --> 00:15:40,163
Frasier, look, I understand.
I was in the Army.

290
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:41,665
We all have our urges.

291
00:15:41,873 --> 00:15:43,750
- But you don't understand.
- Just sign here.

292
00:15:43,959 --> 00:15:45,669
All that happened was...

293
00:15:45,877 --> 00:15:48,171
Bye, Dr. Crane.
Sorry I got you arrested.

294
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:51,174
Oh, that's all right, Crystal.
These things happen.

295
00:15:57,222 --> 00:15:59,599
He had a wig on.

296
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:05,522
- You're my son and I love you.
- Oh, would you stop saying that!

297
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:10,318
I still don't know
what you were thinking.

298
00:16:10,485 --> 00:16:12,195
The middle of the night,
deserted street,

299
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:13,822
picking up a strange woman.

300
00:16:14,072 --> 00:16:16,282
A very strange woman.

301
00:16:17,992 --> 00:16:19,994
Well, obviously I wasn't thinking.

302
00:16:20,161 --> 00:16:21,746
Thank God now it's all over.

303
00:16:21,913 --> 00:16:24,123
I can just spend a quiet weekend here
with Frederick.

304
00:16:24,332 --> 00:16:27,710
Oh, dear God!

305
00:16:28,169 --> 00:16:31,422
"Doc's Pal is a Mock Gal."

306
00:16:34,425 --> 00:16:36,261
Will this nightmare never end?

307
00:16:36,427 --> 00:16:39,180
Now listen, Dad, we're bound to get
a lot of calls about this thing.

308
00:16:39,347 --> 00:16:41,849
Please do not answer the phone.
Don't talk to anybody.

309
00:16:42,016 --> 00:16:45,144
Let the machine get it. Don't give them
anything they can turn tawdry.

310
00:16:45,353 --> 00:16:46,729
Yeah, I live with Dr. Crane.

311
00:16:46,938 --> 00:16:48,940
Yeah, there's quite a bit
of massage involved.

312
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:50,191
Daphne!

313
00:16:50,358 --> 00:16:52,276
Mostly around the hips,
thighs, and buttocks.

314
00:16:52,443 --> 00:16:54,237
No. Give me that.

315
00:16:54,445 --> 00:16:56,072
No comment!

316
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,533
Oh, no, Daphne, please,
don't answer the phone.

317
00:16:58,699 --> 00:16:59,909
Let the machine pick up.

318
00:17:00,117 --> 00:17:02,411
Well, the machine's filled up.
Everyone's been calling.

319
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:05,248
- Oh, God. Where's Frederick?
- He's still asleep.

320
00:17:05,456 --> 00:17:08,292
Look, Dr. Crane, I just want to say
you're the victim here.

321
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:09,502
Thank you.

322
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:11,170
American society's so close-minded

323
00:17:11,379 --> 00:17:13,339
when it comes
to sexual experimentation.

324
00:17:13,547 --> 00:17:16,050
- In Europe...
- Daphne, I didn't do anything wrong!

325
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,386
Well, exactly.
That's what I'm trying to say.

326
00:17:18,552 --> 00:17:21,472
Oh, God, I guess I deserve all this.

327
00:17:21,639 --> 00:17:25,017
I certainly had enough warning
to stop being such a Boy Scout.

328
00:17:25,226 --> 00:17:27,812
But did I listen? No.

329
00:17:27,978 --> 00:17:30,481
Well, from now on, Dr. Crane,

330
00:17:30,648 --> 00:17:34,443
or as Seattle now knows him,
"Dr. Strangelove"...

331
00:17:36,821 --> 00:17:38,864
...is out of the Samaritan business.

332
00:17:39,073 --> 00:17:40,199
Thank you, Niles.

333
00:17:40,908 --> 00:17:44,787
Frasier, have you given much thought
to what you're going to tell Frederick?

334
00:17:45,996 --> 00:17:47,581
Oh, God.

335
00:17:48,165 --> 00:17:50,876
How can I possibly explain it to him?

336
00:17:51,251 --> 00:17:53,337
Well, I guess
the key is not to be evasive.

337
00:17:53,504 --> 00:17:55,464
He's gonna hear about it
sooner or later.

338
00:17:55,673 --> 00:17:58,884
I guess it should be from me.
After all, I am a trained professional.

339
00:17:59,093 --> 00:18:01,595
I'll be able to do it in a way
that won't traumatize the child.

340
00:18:01,762 --> 00:18:03,889
Freddie, don't touch that!

341
00:18:10,187 --> 00:18:12,147
You know,
I could use a glass of orange juice.

342
00:18:12,356 --> 00:18:14,399
I think I'm gonna go in the kitchen
and get a glass.

343
00:18:14,608 --> 00:18:18,070
Oh, orange juice. Yum.
I'm going to come with you for that.

344
00:18:20,113 --> 00:18:23,367
- Am I having another surprise party?
- No.

345
00:18:23,533 --> 00:18:26,995
No, Frederick, here,
sit down for a second, son.

346
00:18:27,204 --> 00:18:29,998
I've got something
I've got to talk to you about.

347
00:18:30,457 --> 00:18:31,625
For the next couple of days,

348
00:18:31,792 --> 00:18:34,711
you're gonna hear
some rather nasty stories

349
00:18:34,878 --> 00:18:38,799
and some snide jokes
about your old man.

350
00:18:39,049 --> 00:18:41,093
Mom's coming?

351
00:18:46,723 --> 00:18:49,601
No. No, no, she's not.

352
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:50,852
It's...

353
00:18:51,061 --> 00:18:54,773
It's very hard for me to tell you this,
but I just spent the night in jail.

354
00:18:54,981 --> 00:18:57,275
Wow, like Brad Johnson's dad.

355
00:18:57,484 --> 00:19:00,904
Well, that was different.
Insider trading is wrong.

356
00:19:02,906 --> 00:19:04,574
- What did you do?
- Well,

357
00:19:04,824 --> 00:19:09,120
I saw a woman standing in the rain,
and I gave her a ride.

358
00:19:09,329 --> 00:19:11,081
You can go to jail for that?

359
00:19:11,331 --> 00:19:13,750
Well, it depends
on the sort of woman.

360
00:19:13,917 --> 00:19:15,168
You see, this particular woman,

361
00:19:15,335 --> 00:19:21,466
this person was a prostitute.

362
00:19:21,674 --> 00:19:24,344
But I didn't know that
until it was too late.

363
00:19:24,511 --> 00:19:26,179
A prostitute?

364
00:19:26,429 --> 00:19:29,349
Oh, God, how can I explain this?

365
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:33,311
A prostitute is someone
who engages in sexual relations

366
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,438
with other people for money.

367
00:19:35,688 --> 00:19:39,400
Dad, I'm 11.
I know what a prostitute is.

368
00:19:40,944 --> 00:19:43,821
But why did you pick one up?

369
00:19:44,447 --> 00:19:49,827
Well, you see, I didn't know
that it was a prostitute at the time.

370
00:19:50,036 --> 00:19:53,664
I was only trying to do a good deed.

371
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,167
And I guess in hindsight,
it was all a big mistake.

372
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:58,294
I just should have minded
my own business.

373
00:19:58,544 --> 00:20:02,215
So, what are you saying, Dad?
You shouldn't try to help people?

374
00:20:04,133 --> 00:20:05,843
Well...

375
00:20:19,315 --> 00:20:22,652
- May I offer you a ride?
- Oh, thank you.

376
00:20:27,907 --> 00:20:30,493
I waved at you a couple of times,
but I didn't think you saw me.

377
00:20:30,659 --> 00:20:31,744
Yes, well, I noticed you.

378
00:20:31,994 --> 00:20:35,331
I was just having
sort of a bad daydream.

379
00:20:35,915 --> 00:20:37,458
So where can I take you?

380
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:39,752
Same place you're going.

381
00:20:40,002 --> 00:20:42,755
- Oh, dear God, you're...
- Laura Hilton.

382
00:20:43,005 --> 00:20:46,967
- I live in your building.
- Of course. Laura. Hi.

383
00:20:47,343 --> 00:20:49,303
I'm so glad you stopped
when you did.

384
00:20:49,511 --> 00:20:51,430
Oh, I'm certainly glad I stopped too.
