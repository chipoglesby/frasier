1
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:17,976
Oh, thank you.

2
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:44,294
That was a very childish prank.

3
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,671
Now you have ruined my coffee.

4
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:48,339
If you can't behave like adults,

5
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:50,216
you shouldn't be coming
to a grown-up cafe.

6
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:51,634
It wasn't us.

7
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:56,806
Aren't you gonna yell at them?

8
00:00:57,682 --> 00:01:00,435
I'm sure they already heard me
yell at you.

9
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:03,646
Niles, thank you for agreeing
to meet me on such short notice.

10
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:05,565
I swear I'm in full-blown crisis.

11
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:10,320
If you're talking about that garish belt,
I have emergency suspenders.

12
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,155
It's not the belt.

13
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:16,409
My high school reunion is tonight
and you know my history.

14
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:19,662
- Oh, not this folderol again.
- It's not folderol.

15
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:21,581
- It's folderol.
- It's not folderol at all.

16
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:24,292
For God's sake, Niles.
Every time my reunion comes around,

17
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,627
it coincides with a severe downturn
in my life.

18
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:28,212
Five years ago, Lilith divorced me.

19
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:30,298
Five years before that,
I was left at the altar.

20
00:01:30,506 --> 00:01:33,426
Five years before that,
I fell face first into the poison ivy.

21
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:37,305
And here we are, right on schedule,
I'm freshly fired.

22
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:40,224
I still don't know why you even went
that poison-ivy year.

23
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:42,768
Niles, the point is, in ten minutes,

24
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:44,979
I have an extremely important
job interview,

25
00:01:45,187 --> 00:01:47,440
a job for which
I am eminently qualified,

26
00:01:47,648 --> 00:01:49,859
but that now
I have no chance of getting.

27
00:01:50,109 --> 00:01:52,069
Well, how can you know that?

28
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,779
Because destiny won't allow it.

29
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:56,490
Destiny's plan is for me
to walk into that reunion this evening

30
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:59,243
the way I always do,
the class loser.

31
00:02:00,327 --> 00:02:01,954
Pitied and shunned by everyone

32
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:05,082
until I wind up sitting
with the most pathetic people there.

33
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:11,380
You mean, the chess club?

34
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:13,174
Worse.

35
00:02:13,382 --> 00:02:16,594
The chess club's
barbershop quartet.

36
00:02:17,094 --> 00:02:19,638
Oh, the Check Mates.

37
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:23,100
I swear to God,
I feel like I have a curse on my head.

38
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:27,146
Frasier, you're a man of science.
You know curses don't exist.

39
00:02:27,354 --> 00:02:29,690
There's a perfectly rational explanation
for all of this.

40
00:02:29,898 --> 00:02:31,734
You tripped
and fell into the poison ivy.

41
00:02:31,942 --> 00:02:35,279
Your radio station changed formats.
Your wife didn't love you.

42
00:02:35,529 --> 00:02:36,530
If this is a pep talk,

43
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:39,992
would you kindly segue
to the peppy part?

44
00:02:41,493 --> 00:02:43,954
Thank you very much. Thank you.

45
00:02:44,496 --> 00:02:47,583
The only reason you're giving credence
to this curse mumbo-jumbo

46
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:49,585
is you're nervous
about your job interview.

47
00:02:49,835 --> 00:02:52,296
But you're a talented professional.

48
00:02:52,546 --> 00:02:55,382
Any station would be lucky
to have you, wouldn't they?

49
00:02:56,133 --> 00:02:59,469
- Yes, I suppose.
- So stop doubting yourself.

50
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,180
You deserve that job,
so go out there and get it.

51
00:03:02,389 --> 00:03:03,932
In an hour's time, it'll be yours,

52
00:03:04,141 --> 00:03:06,435
and after a short trip to the store
to return that belt,

53
00:03:06,643 --> 00:03:08,353
you can thoroughly enjoy
your reunion.

54
00:03:09,521 --> 00:03:11,064
Well, you're right, Niles.

55
00:03:11,315 --> 00:03:13,150
I should think positively.

56
00:03:13,358 --> 00:03:16,486
This interview is gonna go just fine,
and so is this evening.

57
00:03:16,737 --> 00:03:19,406
All I have to do now is get a date.
Where am I gonna find a woman

58
00:03:19,573 --> 00:03:21,116
who is so desperate
for an evening out

59
00:03:21,283 --> 00:03:23,326
that she'd agree
to go to someone else's reunion?

60
00:03:23,535 --> 00:03:24,744
Oh, hey, Frasier.

61
00:03:25,078 --> 00:03:27,164
See? Your luck's changing already.

62
00:03:36,339 --> 00:03:37,465
Hello.

63
00:03:37,674 --> 00:03:40,343
Excuse me,
I'm looking for Steven Rugly's office.

64
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:42,804
- Well, you've come to the right place.
- Oh, splendid.

65
00:03:43,054 --> 00:03:45,473
Is it possible to fetch me a coffee
before my interview?

66
00:03:45,724 --> 00:03:47,267
- Well...
- Better yet,

67
00:03:47,517 --> 00:03:49,894
make it a cup of chamomile tea
with a squirt of lemon

68
00:03:50,103 --> 00:03:52,689
and a full teaspoonful of honey.

69
00:03:52,939 --> 00:03:56,568
We'll try to get that for you just as soon
as my assistant gets back.

70
00:03:56,776 --> 00:04:00,280
I'm Steven Rugly,
president of KJMC.

71
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:02,782
Oh, Lord, I'm... It's nice to meet you.

72
00:04:02,991 --> 00:04:04,993
- I'm terribly sorry.
- Quite all right, Dr. Crane.

73
00:04:05,201 --> 00:04:06,995
- It's a great suit, by the way.
- Thank you.

74
00:04:07,203 --> 00:04:09,080
- Your...
- I know.

75
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:12,250
It's a bit risky. People have been
commenting on it all day.

76
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:17,797
Yes, it makes a bold statement,
but frankly, I like the attention.

77
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:20,591
I cut through the park
on the way over here.

78
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,261
It caught the eye
of many a young lady.

79
00:04:24,929 --> 00:04:27,348
Oh, my God. My fly.

80
00:04:27,807 --> 00:04:29,434
I thought you were talking
about my belt.

81
00:04:29,642 --> 00:04:31,686
Well, shall we start the interview?

82
00:04:31,936 --> 00:04:34,856
Oh, good.
We haven't started yet. Well...

83
00:04:36,441 --> 00:04:39,527
I'm glad you could make it, Dr. Crane.
I've enjoyed your work.

84
00:04:39,735 --> 00:04:42,738
Oh, that's very gracious of you,
Mr. Ugly.

85
00:04:45,032 --> 00:04:47,785
- That didn't come out right, did it?
- What do you mean?

86
00:04:47,994 --> 00:04:50,997
The way I said your name right now
sounded like I called you Mr. Ugly.

87
00:04:51,205 --> 00:04:52,582
I assure you it won't happen again.

88
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:54,917
See, it's just a matter
of separating the Rs.

89
00:04:55,126 --> 00:04:56,585
Mr. Rug.

90
00:04:56,836 --> 00:04:58,087
Mr. Rug.

91
00:04:58,337 --> 00:05:00,298
Mr. Rug.

92
00:05:03,009 --> 00:05:06,053
Ly. Mr. Rugly.

93
00:05:07,179 --> 00:05:10,182
Anyway, I think
you might be a good fit here.

94
00:05:10,391 --> 00:05:12,518
We need to find a replacement
for Dr. Wendy.

95
00:05:12,768 --> 00:05:13,936
- Really?
- Yes.

96
00:05:14,186 --> 00:05:16,439
I didn't feel it was right
to keep her on any longer.

97
00:05:16,689 --> 00:05:20,568
Well, let me say I applaud
your judgement on that score.

98
00:05:20,985 --> 00:05:23,654
I mean, frankly,
Dr. Wendy's saccharine style

99
00:05:23,821 --> 00:05:28,242
is maybe very popular, but, you know,
really not up to your standards, is it?

100
00:05:28,492 --> 00:05:30,077
Dr. Wendy's my mother.

101
00:05:32,162 --> 00:05:33,831
- She's quite ill.
- Oh, well...

102
00:05:34,164 --> 00:05:35,874
- Can I interrupt?
- Oh, please.

103
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:37,459
You have some messages.

104
00:05:37,668 --> 00:05:39,420
- Excuse me for a moment.
- Of course.

105
00:05:39,628 --> 00:05:42,381
- Mr. Jameson has to cancel.
- Oh, very well.

106
00:05:42,589 --> 00:05:45,342
Why don't you call Phyllis Monderer
and see if she can reschedule?

107
00:05:45,509 --> 00:05:47,302
Don't forget to pick up my car
from the shop.

108
00:05:47,511 --> 00:05:49,138
I already did. It's across the street.

109
00:05:49,346 --> 00:05:51,932
Some idiot parked his BMW
in your space.

110
00:05:52,141 --> 00:05:54,893
- Well, have it towed.
- I already made the call.

111
00:05:55,102 --> 00:05:56,270
And can you call Walter Hecht

112
00:05:56,478 --> 00:05:59,231
and see if he can reschedule
for Wednesday?

113
00:06:04,653 --> 00:06:06,196
- Dr. Crane?
- Yes.

114
00:06:07,281 --> 00:06:09,491
We don't have any tea,
but would you like some coffee?

115
00:06:09,741 --> 00:06:12,411
Oh, that would be splendid.
Yes, thank you.

116
00:06:19,668 --> 00:06:23,547
- Everything all right?
- Yes, just fine, thank you.

117
00:06:25,924 --> 00:06:28,176
- What's that?
- Nothing.

118
00:06:29,594 --> 00:06:32,639
- Is this the giraffe from my bookcase?
- Yes, yes, it is. I'm sorry.

119
00:06:32,889 --> 00:06:35,225
I was admiring it.
It broke apart in my hands.

120
00:06:35,433 --> 00:06:36,977
But if your child
is anything like mine,

121
00:06:37,185 --> 00:06:38,812
he'd be delighted
to make you a new one.

122
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:42,482
Actually, my father made it
after his stroke.

123
00:06:45,485 --> 00:06:47,112
Well, I think you've got enough
to go on.

124
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,406
It was lovely meeting you.

125
00:06:50,448 --> 00:06:52,158
I'm sorry, you know,
I'm gonna have to dash

126
00:06:52,325 --> 00:06:54,536
if I'm gonna beat that tow truck.

127
00:07:00,834 --> 00:07:03,211
Hold the elevator.

128
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,671
- Thanks.
- Hello, Dad.

129
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:06,339
Hi.

130
00:07:07,298 --> 00:07:10,468
I'm never going to that grocery store
across the street again.

131
00:07:10,718 --> 00:07:13,012
They gave me such a hard time
because I brought Eddie in.

132
00:07:13,263 --> 00:07:14,722
Oh, well.

133
00:07:14,889 --> 00:07:16,599
It's not exactly sanitary, Dad.

134
00:07:16,808 --> 00:07:18,434
When they get rid
of the guy with pinkeye

135
00:07:18,643 --> 00:07:22,397
who's handing out cheese samples,
they can talk to me about sanitary.

136
00:07:27,944 --> 00:07:31,030
Wait a minute. Didn't you bring home
a case of dog food yesterday?

137
00:07:31,239 --> 00:07:32,699
Yeah, it was the economy stuff.

138
00:07:32,865 --> 00:07:35,034
He wouldn't touch it,
so I gotta take all this back.

139
00:07:35,243 --> 00:07:36,703
This is his favourite kind.

140
00:07:37,161 --> 00:07:38,621
Well, I guess what they say is true:

141
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:41,916
Once you've tasted animal byproducts,
you can't go back to the cheap stuff.

142
00:07:43,251 --> 00:07:45,044
Hey, have you picked
a restaurant for tonight?

143
00:07:45,253 --> 00:07:46,546
I've got a better idea than that.

144
00:07:46,754 --> 00:07:49,215
My old precinct's having
one of their seized-property auctions

145
00:07:49,423 --> 00:07:50,424
down at the fairgrounds.

146
00:07:50,675 --> 00:07:53,636
- Oh, what's the better idea?
- Oh, now, come on, Niles.

147
00:07:53,886 --> 00:07:56,806
These drug dealers
have some pretty nice stuff.

148
00:07:57,390 --> 00:08:01,143
As much as I've been searching
for a wide-brimmed, purple velvet hat,

149
00:08:01,352 --> 00:08:03,479
- it's really not my cup of tea.
- I'll tell you what.

150
00:08:03,688 --> 00:08:06,983
We'll just go for a little while and then
we'll come back here for dinner.

151
00:08:07,233 --> 00:08:08,609
Am I glad you're home.

152
00:08:08,818 --> 00:08:10,820
- What's wrong?
- It's Dr. Crane.

153
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,697
Since he came back
from his job interview,

154
00:08:12,905 --> 00:08:14,115
he's seemed awfully depressed.

155
00:08:14,323 --> 00:08:16,158
In fact, he's as bad
as I've ever seen him.

156
00:08:16,409 --> 00:08:18,452
- Oh, I guess it didn't go well?
- I gather not.

157
00:08:18,702 --> 00:08:20,329
He mumbled something about it
being worse

158
00:08:20,538 --> 00:08:23,582
<i>than the Dresden premiere
of Schumann's 2nd Symphony.</i>

159
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:26,168
And you left him alone?

160
00:08:26,794 --> 00:08:27,920
Where is he?

161
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:29,338
He's in the kitchen.

162
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:34,927
Oh, my God!

163
00:08:36,971 --> 00:08:39,473
- Frasier, are you all right?
- I was fine before you screamed.

164
00:08:39,682 --> 00:08:42,434
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- Daphne said you were depressed.

165
00:08:42,601 --> 00:08:44,144
Here you are
with your head in the oven.

166
00:08:44,395 --> 00:08:48,691
I was cleaning it, Niles. It's electric.

167
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,028
If I was going to end my life,

168
00:08:53,237 --> 00:08:55,114
I'd choose something
quicker than broiling.

169
00:08:58,534 --> 00:09:00,410
Sorry your interview
didn't go well, Fras.

170
00:09:00,661 --> 00:09:01,829
Oh, that's all right, Dad.

171
00:09:02,037 --> 00:09:05,457
You know, things don't work out
the way we'd like them to sometimes,

172
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:06,667
much like my strict

173
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:10,003
"no shopping carts
in the apartment" policy.

174
00:09:10,504 --> 00:09:11,797
Don't worry about it.

175
00:09:12,047 --> 00:09:14,800
I'll take it back, but I need it
to return all that cheap dog food.

176
00:09:14,967 --> 00:09:17,302
I'm going to pick up
cleaning supplies, I'll do it for you.

177
00:09:17,511 --> 00:09:19,388
I thought you need to get ready
for the reunion.

178
00:09:19,596 --> 00:09:20,973
Oh, God, no. I'm not going.

179
00:09:21,181 --> 00:09:22,891
- Why?
- Because I'm cursed.

180
00:09:23,058 --> 00:09:25,560
If I wasn't convinced of it
before today's interview, I am now.

181
00:09:25,769 --> 00:09:27,062
You haven't even heard anything.

182
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:29,564
For all you know,
you might've gotten it.

183
00:09:30,524 --> 00:09:32,067
Believe me, Dad,

184
00:09:32,275 --> 00:09:37,114
I have a better chance
of being crowned Miss Teen U.S.A.

185
00:09:38,115 --> 00:09:39,115
Oh, dear God.

186
00:09:39,324 --> 00:09:43,161
- Just how casual is this thing tonight?
- Roz, I am so sorry.

187
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:46,373
I completely forgot to call
and tell you that, well, we're not going.

188
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:48,667
Wait a second.

189
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:52,671
I found a babysitter at the last minute.
I got a new dress.

190
00:09:52,921 --> 00:09:55,215
I got Miguel to do my hair,
and I just spent the last hour

191
00:09:55,423 --> 00:09:58,343
listening to the Estée Lauder lady
describe her bladder operation

192
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:01,096
just so I could get a free makeover.

193
00:10:01,304 --> 00:10:03,765
- And now you say we're not going?
- Roz, I can't go.

194
00:10:03,973 --> 00:10:06,810
You see,
I have a curse on my head.

195
00:10:07,018 --> 00:10:08,019
What curse?

196
00:10:08,228 --> 00:10:11,564
He thinks the Fates are conspiring
to humiliate him at every reunion.

197
00:10:11,815 --> 00:10:13,650
Come on,
you don't really believe that, do you?

198
00:10:13,858 --> 00:10:17,695
All right, let's examine the evidence.
Daphne, will you assist me, please?

199
00:10:17,946 --> 00:10:19,906
This is my school newsletter.

200
00:10:20,114 --> 00:10:21,908
<i>"The Bryce Academy Crier."</i>

201
00:10:22,158 --> 00:10:25,620
Which, coincidentally, was Frasier's
nickname his first year there.

202
00:10:28,164 --> 00:10:32,835
Just read it. Scott Alexander.
What's he been up to?

203
00:10:33,294 --> 00:10:36,756
"Wife, kids, has his own
computer-software business."

204
00:10:37,006 --> 00:10:38,633
Nancy Kearns.

205
00:10:40,259 --> 00:10:43,346
"Mother of three,
successful physician,

206
00:10:43,554 --> 00:10:46,390
has invented a drug that may aid
in the treatment of cancer."

207
00:10:47,683 --> 00:10:49,894
Cure for cancer.

208
00:10:52,313 --> 00:10:54,148
Won't they be green with envy
when I trump them

209
00:10:54,357 --> 00:10:56,734
with this little story about my life?

210
00:10:56,943 --> 00:10:58,319
Frasier Crane,

211
00:10:58,569 --> 00:11:03,032
unattached, unemployed
and living with his father.

212
00:11:03,908 --> 00:11:06,994
He spends his days
scrubbing his oven

213
00:11:07,161 --> 00:11:11,499
and is anxiously awaiting
his upcoming tooth-cleaning.

214
00:11:12,249 --> 00:11:14,919
Now, now, Frasier,
everyone has ups and downs.

215
00:11:15,086 --> 00:11:18,506
You know, for all we know, that
cure for cancer didn't pan out either.

216
00:11:21,675 --> 00:11:23,594
One can only hope, Dad.

217
00:11:27,223 --> 00:11:30,434
I'll bet if you went in there with a sunny
attitude, you'd have a good time.

218
00:11:30,643 --> 00:11:33,395
You know, I tried sunny last time.
You know where it got me?

219
00:11:33,562 --> 00:11:37,233
Table 97, singing
"Goodbye, My Coney Island Baby"

220
00:11:37,441 --> 00:11:39,985
with the Check Mates.

221
00:11:40,694 --> 00:11:43,614
- Maybe this time will be different.
- That's the mistake I always make.

222
00:11:43,781 --> 00:11:46,450
Thinking this year, it'll be different.
That I can beat the curse.

223
00:11:46,617 --> 00:11:50,162
That's what the curse does. It makes
you think you can beat it, but you can't.

224
00:11:50,913 --> 00:11:55,876
I'm sorry, Roz. I apologize.
I will make this up to you someday.

225
00:11:56,085 --> 00:11:58,295
Right now, I am going
to go down to the store

226
00:11:58,504 --> 00:12:00,506
and run a little errand
for my friend, Eddie.

227
00:12:02,007 --> 00:12:04,259
Tonight, I'll be coming back home

228
00:12:04,468 --> 00:12:06,637
and spending the evening
with Daphne,

229
00:12:06,887 --> 00:12:08,639
doing some light housework

230
00:12:08,889 --> 00:12:11,892
and listening to my brand-new
book on tape:

231
00:12:12,059 --> 00:12:13,810
<i>Depression, Anxiety and Death.</i>

232
00:12:14,019 --> 00:12:17,689
As read by the author himself,
Stanislav Monk.

233
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:20,400
Now who's cursed?

234
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,043
Excuse me, sir, there's a place
to recycle those cans right over there.

235
00:12:38,293 --> 00:12:40,003
Oh, I know.

236
00:12:41,963 --> 00:12:45,217
On behalf of Mother Earth,
I thank you.

237
00:12:51,348 --> 00:12:54,184
That's the sort of person
that drinks chocolate soda.

238
00:12:57,896 --> 00:13:00,899
Come on, gotcha.

239
00:13:01,566 --> 00:13:03,735
Frasier Crane?

240
00:13:03,985 --> 00:13:05,528
Yes.

241
00:13:05,737 --> 00:13:08,948
Percy Williams.
Well, good to see you.

242
00:13:09,157 --> 00:13:10,992
Suppose you're on your way
to the reunion.

243
00:13:11,201 --> 00:13:13,244
Yes. Yes, I am.

244
00:13:13,453 --> 00:13:14,829
Couldn't make it this year myself.

245
00:13:14,996 --> 00:13:17,165
Little too much on my plate.
Things have gotten crazy.

246
00:13:17,373 --> 00:13:19,000
I can see that.

247
00:13:19,709 --> 00:13:21,586
Well, I heard
you weren't on the radio.

248
00:13:21,836 --> 00:13:22,837
Oh, you did?

249
00:13:23,379 --> 00:13:25,215
You know,
my wife heads up a charity

250
00:13:25,423 --> 00:13:27,467
that helps get homeless people
back on their feet.

251
00:13:27,675 --> 00:13:29,385
Yes, I know.
The Boot Strap Foundation.

252
00:13:29,552 --> 00:13:31,095
It's very popular in my circle.

253
00:13:31,304 --> 00:13:33,973
You should call them.
They could help you.

254
00:13:34,349 --> 00:13:36,059
Me?

255
00:13:39,395 --> 00:13:42,231
You know, this is very funny.
The shopping cart, the dog food.

256
00:13:42,398 --> 00:13:45,526
I'm afraid you're suffering
from the wrong impression.

257
00:13:45,735 --> 00:13:46,736
Dog food?

258
00:13:46,986 --> 00:13:49,655
Oh, it's not mine. It's my father's.

259
00:13:51,115 --> 00:13:52,116
Call them, Frasier.

260
00:13:52,366 --> 00:13:55,536
No, no. Really, you're mistaken.
I'm not homeless.

261
00:13:55,787 --> 00:13:58,790
I live in that luxury building right there,
Number 1901.

262
00:13:58,998 --> 00:14:01,667
- Frasier, please, take this.
- I don't need it.

263
00:14:01,876 --> 00:14:04,712
I drive a BMW. I collect African art.

264
00:14:05,129 --> 00:14:06,672
You always were a proud one.

265
00:14:06,881 --> 00:14:08,799
- I'm not proud.
- Then take it.

266
00:14:09,508 --> 00:14:13,471
And for God's sakes,
spend it on food.

267
00:14:14,555 --> 00:14:18,017
I just threw out a $200 belt.

268
00:14:38,871 --> 00:14:40,164
Hey, how was the police auction?

269
00:14:40,372 --> 00:14:42,958
You didn't miss anything,
especially once it started raining.

270
00:14:43,209 --> 00:14:45,878
I made out like a bandit.
Oh, look at this.

271
00:14:48,464 --> 00:14:50,925
Those drug lords
have the most incredible taste.

272
00:14:51,175 --> 00:14:55,095
Christofle silver, Limoges,
Orrefors crystal.

273
00:14:55,304 --> 00:14:57,973
If I ever get married again,
I'm going to register there.

274
00:14:59,892 --> 00:15:01,643
- Hello, all.
- Hey.

275
00:15:02,061 --> 00:15:05,147
- I thought you were staying home.
- Yes, well, not anymore.

276
00:15:05,355 --> 00:15:07,483
I ran into Percy Williams
down at the grocery store.

277
00:15:07,691 --> 00:15:10,110
He mistook me for a street person.

278
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,070
If I don't go down there
and defend myself,

279
00:15:12,237 --> 00:15:15,824
he'll be passing around that rumour
along with the Swedish meatballs.

280
00:15:16,575 --> 00:15:17,868
I'm glad you're going, Dr. Crane.

281
00:15:18,076 --> 00:15:19,786
You'll have a nice time
and you look great.

282
00:15:19,995 --> 00:15:20,996
Thank you.

283
00:15:22,831 --> 00:15:25,250
You have no idea
how big you owe me.

284
00:15:25,459 --> 00:15:26,460
Yes, I do, Roz.

285
00:15:26,668 --> 00:15:28,920
I will never ask you
for another favour again except,

286
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:30,589
could you do something
with your hair?

287
00:15:30,797 --> 00:15:33,008
It seems to be leaning.

288
00:15:33,675 --> 00:15:34,843
Frasier, when you called,

289
00:15:35,052 --> 00:15:36,762
I was in the tub
with a pint of Häagen-Dazs.

290
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:39,514
Considering that was 15 minutes ago,
I think I look pretty good.

291
00:15:39,723 --> 00:15:41,266
And I appreciate it, Roz. I really do.

292
00:15:41,433 --> 00:15:43,435
Daphne, could you please
help Roz getting finished?

293
00:15:43,643 --> 00:15:46,188
- I'm finished.
- No, no, no. Finish more. Come on.

294
00:15:46,396 --> 00:15:49,232
- And remember what I told you.
- Oh, yeah, right.

295
00:15:49,483 --> 00:15:52,903
I'm a model-slash-doctor-slash-
daughter of the duke of Luxembourg.

296
00:15:53,153 --> 00:15:55,071
Yeah, come along, Your Grace.

297
00:15:56,489 --> 00:15:58,325
Frasier?

298
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:01,453
Are you so desperate that
you're trying to impress these people

299
00:16:01,661 --> 00:16:04,414
by having Roz pretend
to be some sort of trophy girlfriend?

300
00:16:04,664 --> 00:16:06,041
Trophy duchess.

301
00:16:07,751 --> 00:16:09,544
Niles, it's the only way
to beat the curse.

302
00:16:09,711 --> 00:16:12,088
You could beat the curse
by not going.

303
00:16:12,297 --> 00:16:14,215
I tried that, Niles.
You see where it got me.

304
00:16:14,466 --> 00:16:16,968
<i>The curse found a way to humiliate me
in absentia.</i>

305
00:16:17,177 --> 00:16:18,803
I've got to get down there.

306
00:16:19,012 --> 00:16:23,141
Why? In order to win the approval
of a group of virtual strangers?

307
00:16:23,725 --> 00:16:26,811
- I know it sounds foolish, Niles...
- No, no, it's not foolish.

308
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,229
It's human.

309
00:16:29,063 --> 00:16:31,900
I think it's all about
the feelings of inferiority

310
00:16:32,066 --> 00:16:34,110
you've been carrying with you
since high school.

311
00:16:34,319 --> 00:16:35,570
That's the real curse.

312
00:16:36,112 --> 00:16:37,739
Only you're not
the Bryce Crier anymore.

313
00:16:37,989 --> 00:16:38,990
You're a successful man.

314
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:41,242
You have an opportunity
for real growth here.

315
00:16:41,492 --> 00:16:44,162
Not by trying to impress these people,
but by realizing that

316
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:46,831
they don't matter anymore.

317
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:50,710
Okay, I'm ready.

318
00:16:51,169 --> 00:16:53,463
Oh, Roz.

319
00:16:53,713 --> 00:16:55,590
You look beautiful.

320
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,550
- Well, thank you.
- But we're not going.

321
00:16:57,717 --> 00:16:59,802
- What?
- Well, I'm sorry, Roz.

322
00:17:00,052 --> 00:17:02,013
It's got something to do
with my personal growth.

323
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:03,931
I don't care
about these people anymore,

324
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,600
and, you know,
I want them to know it.

325
00:17:05,808 --> 00:17:08,686
Frasier, I hired a babysitter twice.

326
00:17:08,936 --> 00:17:10,938
I did my makeup twice.

327
00:17:11,189 --> 00:17:15,318
I performed a miracle of engineering
by taping myself into this dress twice,

328
00:17:15,526 --> 00:17:17,069
only to be stood up twice?

329
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,863
Technically,
you did your hair once.

330
00:17:19,113 --> 00:17:20,114
Shut up!

331
00:17:20,323 --> 00:17:21,324
You know, someday,

332
00:17:21,532 --> 00:17:23,409
you're gonna need
another favour from me, buddy.

333
00:17:23,617 --> 00:17:26,287
And when that day comes, I hope
you know what you can do with it.

334
00:17:26,495 --> 00:17:29,165
- I have a pretty good idea.
- Well, do it twice!

335
00:17:31,167 --> 00:17:34,462
- Well, that was something.
- Please, you call that a tantrum?

336
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:37,006
Maris used to do that once a week.

337
00:17:37,214 --> 00:17:40,050
Poor thing needed help
slamming the door.

338
00:17:40,509 --> 00:17:43,804
Frasier, I was just talking to Duke on
the phone and your agent clicked in.

339
00:17:44,054 --> 00:17:46,515
She was calling from a pay phone
and she couldn't really talk,

340
00:17:46,765 --> 00:17:49,435
but she said that KPOV wants you
to host your own show for them.

341
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:54,898
My own television show?

342
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:57,359
- At KPOV?
- Congratulations, Frasier.

343
00:17:57,568 --> 00:18:00,696
- That's wonderful.
- Thank you. Thank you all.

344
00:18:03,365 --> 00:18:07,202
I just realized, this is an even bigger
opportunity for personal growth.

345
00:18:07,786 --> 00:18:09,580
Having a prestigious new job
like this,

346
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:12,916
and not even going to that reunion
to boast about it.

347
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:15,836
It is a great opportunity, isn't it?

348
00:18:17,671 --> 00:18:19,840
- Have a good time.
- I will.

349
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,264
Well, I must say, Frasier did have
a run of bad luck this week.

350
00:18:27,472 --> 00:18:29,850
I'm certainly glad
it's finally turned out better for him.

351
00:18:30,058 --> 00:18:33,562
No, he didn't really get a call.
I just made it all up.

352
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:36,273
His agent didn't call?

353
00:18:36,481 --> 00:18:40,694
No, I just wanted to give the guy
something to brag about.

354
00:18:41,069 --> 00:18:44,197
Dad, I know you were trying to help
but don't you think that's a little risky?

355
00:18:44,406 --> 00:18:46,241
What if somebody
knows it's not true?

356
00:18:46,491 --> 00:18:48,285
Oh, no, you worry too much.
Who's gonna know?

357
00:18:48,493 --> 00:18:50,120
Most of these people
are from out of town.

358
00:18:50,328 --> 00:18:51,955
They probably never even heard
of KPOV.

359
00:18:52,122 --> 00:18:55,959
I knew it. When you said KPOV,
I thought it sounded familiar.

360
00:18:56,209 --> 00:18:58,420
And it's right here
in Dr. Crane's newsletter.

361
00:18:58,628 --> 00:19:02,424
His classmate Karl Degersdorff
was just named station manager.

362
00:19:05,176 --> 00:19:07,679
Won't that be nice for them?
They'll be working together now.

363
00:19:07,929 --> 00:19:08,930
Oh, my God.

364
00:19:09,139 --> 00:19:11,391
Come on, it's gonna be all right.
Don't worry about it.

365
00:19:11,641 --> 00:19:13,601
This Degersdorff probably
won't even show.

366
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:16,313
You know, he just got a new job.
He's probably real busy.

367
00:19:17,188 --> 00:19:19,691
I guess you're right.
We mustn't assume the worst.

368
00:19:19,899 --> 00:19:22,402
I'm acting like Frasier,
as if there was really a curse.

369
00:19:22,652 --> 00:19:27,073
Look here. He's also serving
as this year's reunion coordinator.

370
00:19:40,044 --> 00:19:42,630
Good evening. Hello.

371
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:44,674
Good to see you again.

372
00:19:45,675 --> 00:19:47,969
Hi, how you been?

373
00:19:52,348 --> 00:19:54,892
- Hi, fellas.
- Hi.

374
00:20:01,524 --> 00:20:02,984
Hit it.

375
00:20:04,694 --> 00:20:06,571
<i>- Hello
- Hello</i>

376
00:20:06,779 --> 00:20:08,406
<i>Hello</i>

377
00:20:08,656 --> 00:20:10,867
<i>Hello</i>

378
00:20:11,117 --> 00:20:14,662
<i>Goodbye my Coney Island baby</i>

379
00:20:14,871 --> 00:20:17,123
<i>Farewell my own true love</i>

380
00:20:17,373 --> 00:20:18,416
<i>True love, oh, honey</i>

381
00:20:18,624 --> 00:20:22,169
<i>I'm goin' to go away and leave you</i>

382
00:20:22,378 --> 00:20:24,213
<i>Never to see you any</i>

383
00:20:24,463 --> 00:20:25,840
<i>Never gonna see you any</i>

384
00:20:26,048 --> 00:20:30,344
<i>I'm gonna sail upon that ferry boat</i>
