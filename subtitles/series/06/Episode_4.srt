1
00:00:08,139 --> 00:00:10,600
Go ahead, Sophie, I'm listening.

2
00:00:10,766 --> 00:00:12,310
<i>Hi, Dr. Crane.</i>

3
00:00:12,518 --> 00:00:14,270
<i>My husband's having
some of his friends over</i>

4
00:00:14,437 --> 00:00:15,771
<i>to watch the game on Sunday,</i>

5
00:00:15,938 --> 00:00:19,400
<i>and I think it'd be nice if some
of my girlfriends could come over too.</i>

6
00:00:19,567 --> 00:00:21,527
<i>- Sounds reasonable.
- Exactly.</i>

7
00:00:21,694 --> 00:00:22,987
<i>I mean, it's just football.</i>

8
00:00:23,154 --> 00:00:27,033
<i>Not football, Einstein.
The Super Bowl.</i>

9
00:00:27,783 --> 00:00:29,785
That would be
your doting husband now.

10
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:34,999
<i>Larry, this is a private conversation.
And for God's sakes, use a plate.</i>

11
00:00:36,042 --> 00:00:38,085
Sophie, why don't you put
your husband on the line?

12
00:00:38,252 --> 00:00:41,297
<i>- Pick up.
- Jeez. Hello?</i>

13
00:00:41,464 --> 00:00:45,926
Larry, I gotta tell you, I'm afraid
I side with your wife on this one.

14
00:00:46,093 --> 00:00:48,637
<i>That just proves you don't know
the first thing about football.</i>

15
00:00:48,804 --> 00:00:50,639
What I do or do not know
about football has...

16
00:00:50,806 --> 00:00:53,350
<i>Okay, how's this?
My wife's friends can come over</i>

17
00:00:53,517 --> 00:00:56,353
<i>if you can answer
even one little football question. Like...</i>

18
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,646
I don't see that's necess...

19
00:00:57,813 --> 00:00:59,565
<i>You're down by six.
You're on your own 40.</i>

20
00:00:59,732 --> 00:01:01,150
<i>Three seconds left.
What do you do?</i>

21
00:01:01,317 --> 00:01:04,486
Well, all right. You would...

22
00:01:05,738 --> 00:01:08,824
You would take your receivers

23
00:01:10,492 --> 00:01:12,202
and line them up

24
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:14,663
and then throw a pass.

25
00:01:14,872 --> 00:01:16,457
A long, long pass.

26
00:01:16,623 --> 00:01:18,500
<i>Yeah, and what's the name
for that?</i>

27
00:01:22,212 --> 00:01:24,173
A Hail Mary.

28
00:01:24,923 --> 00:01:27,342
Sophie and Larry,
I hope you enjoy the game.

29
00:01:27,551 --> 00:01:33,307
In the meanwhile, this is
Coach Crane saying, I'm listening.

30
00:01:34,474 --> 00:01:36,310
I'm impressed.
You're so good at charades.

31
00:01:36,476 --> 00:01:39,563
I'm impressed
you could mime a virgin.

32
00:01:42,149 --> 00:01:43,942
So, Roz, are you walking out?

33
00:01:44,109 --> 00:01:47,195
No, I got stuff to do.
I've got some cards to rack

34
00:01:47,362 --> 00:01:49,781
and I wanna put together
some Best of Crane tapes.

35
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:52,492
- Oh, your mother's still in town?
- In town, in my apartment.

36
00:01:52,659 --> 00:01:55,370
And when I left this morning,
in my refrigerator, smelling my milk.

37
00:01:55,537 --> 00:01:57,122
- Oh, Lord.
- I love her,

38
00:01:57,289 --> 00:01:59,791
I just wish I could get a couple of hours
to myself one night.

39
00:01:59,958 --> 00:02:01,501
You know,
why don't you just ask her?

40
00:02:01,668 --> 00:02:04,212
She might enjoy a little time to herself.
I know my dad does.

41
00:02:04,421 --> 00:02:08,383
You are so lucky.
I wish my mother drank alone.

42
00:02:10,218 --> 00:02:13,972
You know, Roz, your mom's about
the same age as my dad, isn't she?

43
00:02:14,139 --> 00:02:16,683
- Yeah, I guess.
- Does she date much?

44
00:02:16,891 --> 00:02:19,644
Since my father left?
Practically never. No, hang on.

45
00:02:19,811 --> 00:02:21,229
No, no, hear me out, Roz.

46
00:02:21,396 --> 00:02:24,065
Now, Dad hasn't dated anybody
since he and Sherry broke up.

47
00:02:24,274 --> 00:02:26,067
I'm starting to worry
he's lost his nerve.

48
00:02:26,276 --> 00:02:29,320
A date with your mom
could be a tremendous favour to him.

49
00:02:29,529 --> 00:02:31,781
- I don't know.
- Oh, come on, I'll tell you what.

50
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:33,533
It's awkward,
but we can minimise that.

51
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,243
Niles and I are having dinner
with him.

52
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:37,495
We'll take him to McGinty's,
he'll feel comfortable.

53
00:02:37,662 --> 00:02:39,080
You and your mom
can just happen by.

54
00:02:39,247 --> 00:02:42,083
We'll see what transpires.
They'll never even know it's a fix-up.

55
00:02:42,292 --> 00:02:44,210
Oh, what the hell.
I'll give it a shot, I guess.

56
00:02:44,377 --> 00:02:45,920
- Okay.
- How does 5 sound?

57
00:02:46,129 --> 00:02:48,965
Five? Your mother's ready
for dinner at 5?

58
00:02:49,173 --> 00:02:52,176
I keep her on Wisconsin time.
That way, she's in bed by 8.

59
00:03:00,351 --> 00:03:04,105
Hey, look what I got here, boys.
A Funyun Onion.

60
00:03:04,272 --> 00:03:06,399
The chef sent it over
with his compliments.

61
00:03:06,858 --> 00:03:09,444
I wonder what his insults are like.

62
00:03:09,652 --> 00:03:12,071
- Hey, Bonnie.
- Hey, Marty.

63
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,031
- Oh, you must be Frasier,
- Why, yes.

64
00:03:14,198 --> 00:03:15,616
- The big radio star.
- Hello.

65
00:03:15,783 --> 00:03:18,161
- Your dad is so proud of you.
- Oh, Dad.

66
00:03:18,327 --> 00:03:22,748
He talks about you all the time.
Who's your friend?

67
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:26,669
Now, what's wrong with you?
I told you about my other son.

68
00:03:26,877 --> 00:03:31,007
Oh, of course. What am I thinking?
Nice to meet you, Eddie.

69
00:03:33,384 --> 00:03:35,261
This is Niles.
How about some beers, Bonnie?

70
00:03:35,428 --> 00:03:36,512
Coming right up.

71
00:03:39,056 --> 00:03:40,266
- Oh, God.
- What?

72
00:03:40,474 --> 00:03:43,936
The group coming in the door.
They're from the Shangri-La.

73
00:03:44,145 --> 00:03:46,814
- Whoa, it's the Coyote! Hey!
- Yes, hello.

74
00:03:46,981 --> 00:03:49,900
Evening, evening, Jimbo.
Check you later.

75
00:03:52,361 --> 00:03:54,155
Wow, you got a nickname
down there already.

76
00:03:54,321 --> 00:03:56,198
- That's great. The Coyote?
- Yes, yes.

77
00:03:56,407 --> 00:03:59,034
And how did you earn
that honorific?

78
00:03:59,243 --> 00:04:01,161
It was quite the merry road, yes.

79
00:04:01,328 --> 00:04:05,541
It evolved from Niles to Nilesy
to Niley to Nile E. Coyote

80
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:08,085
and now, simply, the Coyote.

81
00:04:11,672 --> 00:04:15,467
Well, just when I thought it couldn't
be refined any further.

82
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:20,431
Goodness, look who's here.
Roz!

83
00:04:20,597 --> 00:04:23,225
What? We don't see enough
of each other during the day?

84
00:04:23,392 --> 00:04:25,769
Isn't this amazing?

85
00:04:25,978 --> 00:04:27,521
Hello, Joanna.

86
00:04:27,729 --> 00:04:30,607
- It's nice to see you again, Frasier.
- Nice to see you again too.

87
00:04:30,816 --> 00:04:32,359
Please, won't you sit down
and join us?

88
00:04:32,526 --> 00:04:34,027
Oh, no, no, we don't want to intrude.

89
00:04:34,194 --> 00:04:36,697
Oh, no, no, no, please, please, please,
the more the merrier.

90
00:04:36,864 --> 00:04:39,616
All right. Mom, this is Frasier's dad,
Martin Crane.

91
00:04:39,783 --> 00:04:42,369
- This is my mother, Joanna Doyle.
- Very nice to meet you.

92
00:04:42,536 --> 00:04:44,579
- And this is my other son, Niles.
- How do you do?

93
00:04:44,746 --> 00:04:46,081
- It's a pleasure.
- Likewise.

94
00:04:46,248 --> 00:04:49,584
Roz, would you just look
at the two of them?

95
00:04:49,751 --> 00:04:51,545
How did you two manage
to finish all that?

96
00:04:51,712 --> 00:04:55,215
Oh, please, this is how
our generation ate every day.

97
00:04:55,424 --> 00:04:59,553
I used to live on cigarettes, whisky
sours and bacon cheeseburgers.

98
00:05:00,137 --> 00:05:01,721
Yeah, and what about breakfast?

99
00:05:01,888 --> 00:05:04,099
Fried eggs, sausage patties,
hash browns.

100
00:05:04,266 --> 00:05:06,560
My God. Last night,
I ate a profiterole

101
00:05:06,726 --> 00:05:09,020
and lay awake till dawn,
waiting for my heart attack.

102
00:05:10,981 --> 00:05:12,983
Those were simpler times,
weren't they, Marty?

103
00:05:13,149 --> 00:05:16,528
Oh, yeah, we didn't worry
about dumb things like cholesterol.

104
00:05:16,695 --> 00:05:18,488
We worried about putting food
on the table,

105
00:05:18,655 --> 00:05:21,032
keeping the yard clean
and the car shiny.

106
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,786
- And the H-bomb.
- Well, yeah, right.

107
00:05:24,953 --> 00:05:28,289
Say, Roz, we better get going if
we're gonna get our work done tonight.

108
00:05:28,498 --> 00:05:29,791
Oh, I should be running too.

109
00:05:29,999 --> 00:05:32,377
But Mom and I are going
to that jazz club on 5th.

110
00:05:32,544 --> 00:05:35,380
But we promised
to finish those promos tonight.

111
00:05:35,547 --> 00:05:36,881
Oh, right.

112
00:05:37,048 --> 00:05:39,843
- Mom, I'm sorry. I totally forgot.
- It's okay.

113
00:05:40,009 --> 00:05:44,806
Wait, I've got an idea.
Dad, since I'm kidnapping Roz,

114
00:05:44,973 --> 00:05:46,683
why don't you take Joanna
to the jazz club?

115
00:05:46,891 --> 00:05:48,184
Well, sure, I'd love to.

116
00:05:48,393 --> 00:05:51,187
- Is that okay with you, Mom?
- If Martin's game, I'm game.

117
00:05:51,396 --> 00:05:52,564
- Oh, well, perfect.
- Great.

118
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:55,024
Okay, you kids
just have some coffee.

119
00:05:55,191 --> 00:05:57,402
We'll see you back
at the apartment later, okay?

120
00:05:57,568 --> 00:05:58,611
All right, all right.

121
00:05:58,778 --> 00:06:02,281
- It was very, very nice to meet you.
- Thank you.

122
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:05,535
Look at them. They think
we don't know this is a setup.

123
00:06:05,702 --> 00:06:07,203
Well, how could we figure it out?

124
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:10,832
We're just a retired detective
and an attorney general.

125
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:14,168
You were absolutely right.
They didn't suspect a thing.

126
00:06:14,335 --> 00:06:16,504
I told you, Roz,
just leave it to the master.

127
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:21,676
God, I thought
they'd be home by now.

128
00:06:21,843 --> 00:06:26,097
Roz, would you please relax
and watch the pageant with us?

129
00:06:26,305 --> 00:06:28,516
They're right in the middle
of the talent competition.

130
00:06:28,724 --> 00:06:31,936
It's shameless the way they're sucking
up to the international panel of judges.

131
00:06:32,103 --> 00:06:36,107
Miss Germany just played
"Lady of Spain" on her French horn.

132
00:06:36,315 --> 00:06:38,734
At least it wasn't half as bad
as that tone-deaf performance

133
00:06:38,901 --> 00:06:41,821
by the aptly named Miss Singapore.

134
00:06:45,366 --> 00:06:47,451
Roz, you're gonna chew
that nail right off. Stop it.

135
00:06:47,618 --> 00:06:50,871
I can't help it. I'm nervous.
Do you think it's gonna turn out okay?

136
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:52,748
- Who cares?
- Not for Miss Brazil.

137
00:06:52,957 --> 00:06:56,418
Look at the tree trunks on her.
She's her own little rainforest.

138
00:06:59,213 --> 00:07:01,549
I just keep worrying that
she's gonna have a lousy time

139
00:07:01,715 --> 00:07:04,760
and it'll be all my fault.
Screwing up, like always.

140
00:07:04,969 --> 00:07:07,471
Oh, come on, Roz, your mother
doesn't think you're a screw-up.

141
00:07:07,638 --> 00:07:11,892
Yeah? In high school,
I ran my own informal shoplifting clinic.

142
00:07:12,059 --> 00:07:13,602
In college, I dropped out of pre-law

143
00:07:13,769 --> 00:07:17,648
because it interfered with
Bruce Springsteen's touring schedule.

144
00:07:17,815 --> 00:07:19,900
And now,
I am currently an unwed mother.

145
00:07:20,067 --> 00:07:21,777
- What would you call me?
- Tramp.

146
00:07:22,277 --> 00:07:23,320
Daphne!

147
00:07:24,655 --> 00:07:26,240
It's Miss Venezuela.

148
00:07:26,448 --> 00:07:30,494
If that dress of hers was slit
any higher, you could see Caracas.

149
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:34,498
Oh, Roz, you know what?
So what if they don't get along?

150
00:07:34,665 --> 00:07:36,500
I mean, my God,
so we made a mistake.

151
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:39,002
You don't understand.
My mother doesn't make mistakes.

152
00:07:39,211 --> 00:07:43,257
She does everything well.
She's smart, successful, classy.

153
00:07:43,423 --> 00:07:45,842
Oh, what the hell was I thinking?

154
00:07:46,426 --> 00:07:49,429
About what?
Setting her up with my father?

155
00:07:49,638 --> 00:07:52,933
- No, that's not what I meant.
- That is exactly what you meant.

156
00:07:53,141 --> 00:07:54,810
Well, okay, Frasier.

157
00:07:54,977 --> 00:07:58,021
No offence, your father
is a very nice man, but let's face it.

158
00:07:58,188 --> 00:08:01,441
My mother was the attorney general
of Wisconsin.

159
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:05,946
Well, I hope he remembers
to curtsy before the Dairy Queen.

160
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:09,407
This is ridiculous.
I'm gonna watch this in my room.

161
00:08:09,574 --> 00:08:14,621
Miss Finland just laid out her plan
to end world hunger and I missed it.

162
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:17,374
- Oh, Lord, okay.
- They're back.

163
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:21,127
Oh, Roz,
that is the best promo of all.

164
00:08:21,294 --> 00:08:23,838
Oh, hi. How was your evening?

165
00:08:24,005 --> 00:08:28,426
Oh, the jazz was first-rate,
but I'm afraid I talked Martin's ear off.

166
00:08:28,593 --> 00:08:31,388
Oh, you're crazy. Your mother
tells wonderful stories, Roz.

167
00:08:31,554 --> 00:08:35,266
- I could have listened to her all night.
- You are either too kind or a little tipsy.

168
00:08:35,475 --> 00:08:36,976
But thank you.

169
00:08:37,185 --> 00:08:39,104
- Come on, Lambie.
- Okay, let me get my coat.

170
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:40,647
I really had a lovely time.

171
00:08:40,814 --> 00:08:42,899
Well, I can't remember
when I had a better time.

172
00:08:43,066 --> 00:08:44,776
We're gonna have to do this again.

173
00:08:44,984 --> 00:08:46,861
- Bye, Frasier.
- Good night, Joanna.

174
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:49,280
- Lambie.
- Bye.

175
00:08:50,698 --> 00:08:55,119
So tell me all about it. Come on.

176
00:08:55,328 --> 00:08:57,539
Well, being a gentleman,
I don't wanna go into details.

177
00:08:57,705 --> 00:09:02,627
- So suffice it to say, it stunk!
- What?

178
00:09:02,835 --> 00:09:05,254
That was the dullest evening
of my life.

179
00:09:05,421 --> 00:09:08,049
- The way she drones on and on.
- Oh, no.

180
00:09:08,216 --> 00:09:09,967
Do you know how many
metric tons of eggs

181
00:09:10,134 --> 00:09:11,469
Wisconsin produces every year?

182
00:09:11,636 --> 00:09:13,930
- No.
- Well, I do.

183
00:09:14,138 --> 00:09:16,140
Look, Frasier,
I know you meant well.

184
00:09:16,349 --> 00:09:19,477
But if you ever set me up again,
I'll kill you in your sleep. Good night.

185
00:09:25,149 --> 00:09:26,192
Roz.

186
00:09:26,359 --> 00:09:29,278
I told my mom to meet me downstairs.
I just had to come up and tell you.

187
00:09:29,445 --> 00:09:31,280
She had the best time.

188
00:09:31,447 --> 00:09:33,449
She can't wait to go out
with your father again.

189
00:09:33,616 --> 00:09:35,576
Will you tell him
to call her tomorrow?

190
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:38,287
Frasier, this whole thing
worked out like a dream.

191
00:09:38,496 --> 00:09:43,542
It's amazing.
Her voice is still echoing in my head.

192
00:09:44,502 --> 00:09:48,214
Yes, it's like a fairy tale
over here too.

193
00:09:52,468 --> 00:09:54,595
I've just got to find
some way to tell Roz.

194
00:09:54,804 --> 00:09:57,515
Well, why?
It's just gonna hurt her mom's feelings.

195
00:09:57,681 --> 00:09:59,350
Her feelings
are gonna be hurt anyway.

196
00:09:59,558 --> 00:10:02,061
She's here till Sunday.
She's expecting him to call.

197
00:10:02,228 --> 00:10:03,771
Oh, dear God.

198
00:10:03,938 --> 00:10:06,607
At least this way,
Roz can let her down easy.

199
00:10:06,774 --> 00:10:09,610
It looks like both of us have
difficult conversations ahead of us.

200
00:10:09,777 --> 00:10:11,362
- What's yours?
- All week long,

201
00:10:11,529 --> 00:10:15,199
I have been getting less coffee
and more foam in my cappuccino.

202
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:18,327
It's about time for someone
to raise a little hell.

203
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:19,703
Who's on steamer duty?

204
00:10:19,912 --> 00:10:22,456
Well, it's that hulking fellow, Thad.

205
00:10:22,623 --> 00:10:25,751
The one who doesn't react when
his arm touches the steamer nozzle.

206
00:10:29,004 --> 00:10:31,048
Where is that suggestion box?

207
00:10:33,592 --> 00:10:35,552
- Oh, hey, Frasier.
- Oh, Roz, hi.

208
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:37,930
Double espresso to go, please.

209
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:39,765
Listen, I really need
to thank you again.

210
00:10:39,932 --> 00:10:42,017
My mother had the best time
last night.

211
00:10:42,184 --> 00:10:44,561
And when we got home,
we started talking.

212
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:46,271
We ended up staying up
half the night.

213
00:10:46,438 --> 00:10:49,149
- Oh, Roz, I'm glad for you, but...
- It was like a wall came down.

214
00:10:49,358 --> 00:10:51,568
She just opened up to me.

215
00:10:51,735 --> 00:10:53,779
She started telling me
about how hard it was on her

216
00:10:53,946 --> 00:10:56,823
when my dad left
and how Ionely she's been.

217
00:10:57,366 --> 00:10:59,242
It was like she was talking
to a girlfriend,

218
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:01,328
instead of her screw-up daughter.

219
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:03,330
So has Martin called her yet?

220
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:08,585
No. But he will, soon.

221
00:11:09,044 --> 00:11:10,420
He had a really busy morning.

222
00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:13,298
How does his weekend look?
Because she's leaving Sunday night.

223
00:11:13,465 --> 00:11:15,175
Sunday? Oh, well, let's see.

224
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:19,262
Tonight is poker night.
That's no good.

225
00:11:19,471 --> 00:11:24,100
Saturday, he's made plans
to drive Duke to Tacoma

226
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:28,563
for that all-day Tacoma fest.

227
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:33,234
Well, and Sunday we go to a matinee
and then I drive her to the airport.

228
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:34,819
Oh, darn.

229
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:37,906
Wait a minute, I can give my ticket
to Martin and they can go together.

230
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:40,033
No, no, no, Sunday's no good,
because that's...

231
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,952
- Oh, right. It's the Super Bowl.
- Right. The Super Bowl.

232
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:45,914
And you know how Dad is
about football. It's like a religion to him.

233
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:49,292
In fact, he's made Niles and I promise
that we'd watch it with him this year.

234
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:51,503
Oh, well, okay, let's just forget
about the tickets

235
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:54,380
and we'll come over to your place
and watch the game.

236
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:56,508
Is there any reason
why that won't work?

237
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:58,510
Not that I can come up with.

238
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:02,639
That's great.
My mom's gonna be so excited.

239
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:04,182
- Oh, thank you, Niles.
- Oh, yeah.

240
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:07,185
I'll see you Sunday
at your Super Bowl party.

241
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:13,941
I see you told Roz the news
and she went insane.

242
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:17,153
Couldn't do it.

243
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:20,073
Told her we were watching
the Super Bowl with Dad,

244
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,949
and she and her mother
are coming over.

245
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:23,326
This is a nightmare.

246
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:25,953
I know, I know.
I've got to find some way to tell Dad.

247
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:29,207
I have to watch the Super Bowl?

248
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,251
Suppose the sooner I tell him,
the better.

249
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,253
Oh, not necessarily.

250
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:36,506
- What do you mean?
- Well, you know Dad.

251
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:39,425
If you warn him Joanna's coming over,
he'll just bolt to McGinty's.

252
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:42,136
If I were you, I would wait
till five minutes before game time,

253
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:44,847
then spring it on him.
That way, he has no choice but to stay.

254
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:47,308
Well, I think I owe him more
than five minutes' warning.

255
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:49,810
Besides that, Dad would never
deliberately hurt Joanna

256
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:51,312
by standing her up.

257
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:53,606
He is first and foremost
a gentleman.

258
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:55,358
I saw Roz, so I hid outside

259
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:59,070
in case that old gasbag of
a mother was with her.

260
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:03,866
Well, I guess she wasn't.
Everybody's still awake.

261
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:13,584
Here we go.

262
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:15,336
Look at those guys
in the locker room.

263
00:13:15,502 --> 00:13:19,006
Nervous, hearts pounding,
probably a little sick to their stomachs.

264
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:20,758
- The poor kids.
- Yes.

265
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,176
Until I got out of high school,

266
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:25,179
I didn't know there was any other way
to feel in a locker room.

267
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:27,973
What's the matter with you?
You keep looking at your watch.

268
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:29,266
- Was I?
- Yeah.

269
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,851
Is there something on your mind?

270
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,353
No. No, no, no.

271
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:35,898
But there's something I need to talk
to you about, but now is not the time.

272
00:13:36,356 --> 00:13:38,776
- Now is the time.
- Just let me get the door.

273
00:13:38,942 --> 00:13:41,278
No, Dad, that's what I have
to talk to you about.

274
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:46,158
See, that's gonna be Roz
and her mother.

275
00:13:46,366 --> 00:13:47,826
- What?
- Well,

276
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:50,204
Joanna had such a good time
with you the other night,

277
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:52,456
and you did say
that you would see her again.

278
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:54,666
Rather than send her home
with her feelings hurt,

279
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:57,252
- I told her you wanted her here.
- What, like a date?

280
00:13:57,461 --> 00:14:00,088
That's the beauty of it.
It's like a date, but it's not a date.

281
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:03,508
You just, you know, make small talk.
You pass the dip.

282
00:14:03,675 --> 00:14:05,344
No, Frasier, you don't understand.

283
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:08,347
Look, Dad, I know that you found her
a little less than scintillating,

284
00:14:08,513 --> 00:14:10,515
but please,
it'll be over before you know it.

285
00:14:11,516 --> 00:14:12,559
Hey, Frasier.

286
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:13,769
- Hi, Bonnie.
- Martin.

287
00:14:13,977 --> 00:14:17,814
Hey, Bonnie, glad you could make it.
Let me hold that, yes.

288
00:14:17,981 --> 00:14:20,066
See, this is what I was trying
to tell you, Frasier.

289
00:14:20,233 --> 00:14:22,319
- I invited Bonnie.
- Oh, how nice.

290
00:14:22,777 --> 00:14:23,945
So, what do you got here?

291
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:26,615
Oh, it's my special devilled ham
in the shape of a football.

292
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:29,409
But I still need to put on
some macaroni laces.

293
00:14:29,576 --> 00:14:31,703
Oh, okay. Well, the kitchen's
right down there.

294
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:34,414
Just holler if you need anything.

295
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:38,251
What did you invite her for?

296
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,503
I like her, I thought
I might want to ask her out

297
00:14:40,712 --> 00:14:43,381
and if she came over,
that'd be a step in the right direction.

298
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:46,217
You know, I mean,
like a date, but not a date.

299
00:14:47,969 --> 00:14:49,429
That's gonna be Roz
and her mother.

300
00:14:49,637 --> 00:14:51,347
Should I put some coffee on
while I'm here?

301
00:14:51,556 --> 00:14:53,683
You better. We're gonna need it.

302
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:57,437
Come on, would it kill you to be civil
for the length of one Super Bowl?

303
00:14:57,645 --> 00:14:59,647
What is that,
an hour out of your life?

304
00:14:59,814 --> 00:15:02,358
- Hi.
- Hi. Oh, sorry, come on in.

305
00:15:02,525 --> 00:15:06,321
- Thank you so much for inviting us.
- It wouldn't be any fun without you.

306
00:15:06,487 --> 00:15:08,656
Could you show my mom
where Alice can finish her nap?

307
00:15:08,823 --> 00:15:10,158
I'm sure Dad would love to. Dad?

308
00:15:10,325 --> 00:15:12,869
My pleasure, yeah.
Just come this way, Joanna.

309
00:15:13,036 --> 00:15:14,245
So you're a big football fan?

310
00:15:14,412 --> 00:15:16,289
No, actually,
I've never even seen a game.

311
00:15:16,456 --> 00:15:19,876
I was hoping you would explain
as we go along.

312
00:15:21,878 --> 00:15:23,546
Okay, who's hungry?

313
00:15:24,172 --> 00:15:25,840
Oh, hi, I'm Bonnie.

314
00:15:26,049 --> 00:15:29,469
Hi. From McGinty's.
Oh, I didn't know you were coming.

315
00:15:29,677 --> 00:15:33,681
Yeah, Martin invited me.
He was real cute about it.

316
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:36,809
He checked with all the waitresses
to find out if I was single.

317
00:15:38,895 --> 00:15:41,189
Yes, well, you know how Dad is.
He's always trying to...

318
00:15:41,355 --> 00:15:43,191
Hey, hey, the Coyote.

319
00:15:44,233 --> 00:15:46,193
- Find a new girl for Niles.

320
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,696
Niles, you remember Bonnie.
She waited on us at McGinty's.

321
00:15:48,905 --> 00:15:53,242
Oh, yes, of course.
I'll have a vodka martini, very dry.

322
00:15:53,784 --> 00:15:55,828
Don't be silly, Niles.
Bonnie is here as our guest.

323
00:15:56,037 --> 00:15:57,997
Yeah, your dad thought
you two might hit it off.

324
00:16:02,043 --> 00:16:05,796
The Super Bowl and a date.
Hot diggity.

325
00:16:07,173 --> 00:16:10,509
Well, come here.
You're just in time for my specialty.

326
00:16:13,053 --> 00:16:16,765
Isn't that interesting?
Something formerly ham.

327
00:16:19,351 --> 00:16:22,188
- Well, I'm off to the cinema.
- You're not staying for the game?

328
00:16:22,354 --> 00:16:24,315
Sorry, but American football's
not for me.

329
00:16:24,481 --> 00:16:26,984
<i>And they're showing
Wuthering Heights downtown.</i>

330
00:16:27,151 --> 00:16:29,361
I think it's the most romantic movie
ever made.

331
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:32,114
- You're going alone?
- Yes, unfortunately.

332
00:16:32,323 --> 00:16:33,657
It's more fun to go with someone.

333
00:16:33,824 --> 00:16:35,826
Except, of course,
it always ends the same way.

334
00:16:35,993 --> 00:16:37,619
Me weeping
all over me date's shoulder,

335
00:16:37,786 --> 00:16:39,621
while he does what he can
to comfort me.

336
00:16:39,788 --> 00:16:42,875
Well, you should've seen me cry
putting onions in this ham loaf.

337
00:16:43,042 --> 00:16:46,587
I must have gone through
a whole roll of toilet paper.

338
00:16:48,755 --> 00:16:51,925
Well, enjoy your game.

339
00:16:52,551 --> 00:16:55,095
Frasier, may I see you
in the kitchen?

340
00:16:56,722 --> 00:16:59,266
That's amazing.
You do all that you do

341
00:16:59,433 --> 00:17:04,313
and still have time to be a docent at
the cheese museum on the weekends.

342
00:17:04,479 --> 00:17:06,148
Frasier, can I see you
in the kitchen?

343
00:17:06,315 --> 00:17:09,318
Just a second, Dad.
I gotta take drink orders in here.

344
00:17:12,612 --> 00:17:16,116
Thanks for setting me up
with that SPAM-happy tootsie.

345
00:17:17,034 --> 00:17:18,118
What are you talking about?

346
00:17:18,326 --> 00:17:20,787
Bonnie. Frasier told me
you invited her here for me.

347
00:17:20,996 --> 00:17:23,415
I invited her here for me.
He said I invited her for you

348
00:17:23,582 --> 00:17:25,709
because he didn't wanna hurt
Miss Boring's feelings.

349
00:17:25,917 --> 00:17:29,754
Now, now, no private conversations.
Your dates are waiting.

350
00:17:29,963 --> 00:17:32,299
- They're not our dates.
- We hate them.

351
00:17:34,092 --> 00:17:36,636
Now, listen, I realise
that this is a very difficult situation,

352
00:17:36,803 --> 00:17:40,307
but if we all cooperate,
we can send everybody home happy.

353
00:17:40,515 --> 00:17:42,142
And, Dad, if you would like,

354
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:45,687
you can discreetly take Bonnie aside
and tell her what's going on.

355
00:17:46,271 --> 00:17:49,024
- Bonnie, can I tell you something?
- I said discreetly.

356
00:17:50,567 --> 00:17:52,444
I think the game is about to start.

357
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:55,196
Oh, that reminds me.
I wanna get Alice's bottle warming.

358
00:17:55,363 --> 00:17:58,742
- Oh, you have a baby?
- Oh, the most adorable little girl.

359
00:17:58,908 --> 00:18:01,119
Yeah, she's a real beaut.
You ought to see her, Bonnie.

360
00:18:01,286 --> 00:18:04,247
- You can come when I feed her.
- No, you go ahead and get that ready.

361
00:18:04,456 --> 00:18:06,166
I'll show Bonnie.
It's right through there.

362
00:18:06,332 --> 00:18:08,877
Now, Dad, don't you get fresh
with Niles' girl there.

363
00:18:09,085 --> 00:18:11,254
Oh, I won't if he won't.

364
00:18:13,339 --> 00:18:16,467
Your father is really smitten
with that baby, isn't he?

365
00:18:16,676 --> 00:18:18,845
I think he's just got a weak spot
for the Doyle women.

366
00:18:19,053 --> 00:18:20,388
- Oh, now.
- Yes.

367
00:18:20,555 --> 00:18:22,932
Well, he may appear
to have a crusty exterior,

368
00:18:23,099 --> 00:18:26,185
but deep down inside,
Dad's just an old softy.

369
00:18:26,394 --> 00:18:28,479
<i>Well, there's the kid.</i>

370
00:18:28,646 --> 00:18:31,607
<i>Kind of a gooney-looking thing,
isn't she?</i>

371
00:18:31,816 --> 00:18:33,151
Is that Dad?

372
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:35,194
<i>Look, Bonnie,
I gotta tell you something.</i>

373
00:18:35,403 --> 00:18:38,197
<i>I didn't ask you here for Niles.
I asked you here for me.</i>

374
00:18:38,406 --> 00:18:40,658
It's the baby monitor. We should...

375
00:18:41,284 --> 00:18:43,953
<i>- I wanna hear this.
- I thought you were with Joanna.</i>

376
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,414
<i>No, no, Frasier and Roz
set us up last week.</i>

377
00:18:46,581 --> 00:18:48,499
<i>I told Frasier
I thought she was a big snooze,</i>

378
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:51,043
<i>especially compared to the fun
you and I have at the bar,</i>

379
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:52,461
<i>but he stuck me with her again.</i>

380
00:18:52,628 --> 00:18:54,463
You know, I think they know it's on.

381
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:56,549
- They're just having some fun with us.
- Yeah.

382
00:18:56,757 --> 00:18:59,427
- Yeah, I better go tell him...
- Frasier, Frasier, just stay put.

383
00:18:59,593 --> 00:19:01,887
<i>Then Niles isn't my date?
Oh, there's a relief.</i>

384
00:19:02,096 --> 00:19:05,933
<i>- I mean, no offence, Marty, but...
- Hey, you don't have to tell me.</i>

385
00:19:06,142 --> 00:19:11,188
Okay. If anybody wants me,
I'll be at the movies.

386
00:19:11,814 --> 00:19:15,151
<i>So you really like me?
You're not just pulling my leg?</i>

387
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:18,320
<i>- You want proof?
- I think we can turn this off now.</i>

388
00:19:18,487 --> 00:19:23,659
Joanna, I am so sorry.

389
00:19:24,285 --> 00:19:27,246
- I know it sounded bad, but...
- No, no, no, not at all.

390
00:19:27,454 --> 00:19:30,749
I'm sure your father meant "big
snooze" in the most flattering sense.

391
00:19:32,585 --> 00:19:35,587
- Roz, maybe we should leave.
- What were you thinking?

392
00:19:35,754 --> 00:19:38,465
Oh, Roz, I certainly wasn't thinking
that he had a date planned.

393
00:19:38,674 --> 00:19:42,136
I'm just gonna get Alice.
Mom, I'm so sorry.

394
00:19:42,302 --> 00:19:44,221
Believe me, 20 years in politics,

395
00:19:44,388 --> 00:19:47,725
I've been called worse things
than boring.

396
00:19:48,809 --> 00:19:52,813
Well, I hope you'll understand if
I just slip out

397
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:56,233
- without saying goodbye to Martin.
- Of course, Joanna.

398
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,445
The last thing we need today
is another awkward situation.

399
00:20:00,612 --> 00:20:03,282
Roz, knock, will you?!

400
00:20:08,078 --> 00:20:11,915
- I left my diaper bag.
- Right. Here you go.

401
00:20:12,124 --> 00:20:15,127
- Can you come in for a bit?
- I really shouldn't.

402
00:20:15,294 --> 00:20:19,089
Roz, I'm so sorry.

403
00:20:20,841 --> 00:20:22,259
It's all right.

404
00:20:22,426 --> 00:20:25,387
I mean, I'm not gonna say
that my mother wasn't hurt.

405
00:20:25,554 --> 00:20:28,932
But she did start to smile a little bit
about it on the way to the airport.

406
00:20:31,184 --> 00:20:34,604
You know, I've been, well, sitting here,

407
00:20:34,771 --> 00:20:38,775
trying to figure out why I was so eager
to play matchmaker for Dad.

408
00:20:38,984 --> 00:20:40,151
Oh, you're not alone.

409
00:20:40,318 --> 00:20:43,488
I mean, I was excited
once I thought it was going well.

410
00:20:43,697 --> 00:20:47,158
Well, I suspect I wasn't doing it so
much for him as it was doing it for me.

411
00:20:47,659 --> 00:20:50,870
You know, I see him here all the time,
all alone.

412
00:20:52,789 --> 00:20:55,458
I wonder if maybe
that's not gonna be me someday.

413
00:20:55,667 --> 00:20:59,004
Oh, my God,
I think the same thing sometimes

414
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:01,631
when I see these older ladies
in my building.

415
00:21:01,798 --> 00:21:05,009
They all wanna babysit Alice,
just for the company.

416
00:21:05,176 --> 00:21:08,721
I mean, she's a cute baby,
but she ain't no Dorothy Parker.

417
00:21:09,889 --> 00:21:13,476
Oh, well, you know,
we're both gonna be fine.

418
00:21:13,685 --> 00:21:16,020
- Yeah.
- I was just thinking, though,

419
00:21:16,229 --> 00:21:20,108
if we want to play it safe,
we could make one of those pacts.

420
00:21:20,608 --> 00:21:24,279
Oh, you mean like, in 40 years,
if neither one of us finds anyone...?

421
00:21:24,445 --> 00:21:26,781
Yeah, exactly.
We'll marry each other.

422
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:29,367
I was gonna say kill each other.

423
00:21:32,453 --> 00:21:35,832
Well, six of one. Bye.
