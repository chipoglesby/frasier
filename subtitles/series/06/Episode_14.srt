1
00:00:08,283 --> 00:00:10,869
Know what I could go for?
Some fried eggs and bacon.

2
00:00:11,036 --> 00:00:14,122
- Here's your bran flakes.
- Oh, fine.

3
00:00:20,128 --> 00:00:22,130
Oh, hot.

4
00:00:26,343 --> 00:00:29,096
- Don't give him any toast.
- I'm not.

5
00:00:36,645 --> 00:00:41,149
Lifestyle, Sports and recycling.

6
00:00:42,651 --> 00:00:45,487
Yes, we see you, Eddie.
Eight o'clock on the dot.

7
00:00:45,654 --> 00:00:47,572
Well, he's a dog.
What do you expect?

8
00:00:47,739 --> 00:00:50,075
He's a creature of habit.

9
00:00:51,952 --> 00:00:53,411
- Good morning, all.
- Hey, Fras.

10
00:00:53,578 --> 00:00:54,621
- Dad, Daphne.
- Go on.

11
00:00:54,788 --> 00:00:55,830
- Morning.
- Say, Dad,

12
00:00:55,997 --> 00:00:58,375
you remember that woman
I went out with on Valentine's Day,

13
00:00:58,541 --> 00:01:01,711
but I wasn't quite sure
if it was a romantic thing?

14
00:01:01,878 --> 00:01:04,005
Yeah, that new publicity woman
at the station.

15
00:01:04,214 --> 00:01:05,423
Yes, Cassandra Stone.

16
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:08,051
Well, I asked her out again last night,
and I got my answer.

17
00:01:08,218 --> 00:01:10,678
Oh, I'm sorry, Fras.

18
00:01:13,348 --> 00:01:14,808
No, I'm not finished.

19
00:01:15,016 --> 00:01:17,519
That's the spirit. You hang in there.

20
00:01:18,311 --> 00:01:19,521
You know, Dr. Crane,

21
00:01:19,729 --> 00:01:21,773
someone once said
that long periods of abstinence

22
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:23,441
can actually refresh the soul.

23
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:25,527
- Good morning, everyone.
- That someone was me

24
00:01:25,693 --> 00:01:29,072
and I was full of it.
Everyone, this is Cassandra.

25
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:31,741
You must be Frasier's dad.
I've heard all about you.

26
00:01:31,908 --> 00:01:33,785
- Marty Crane.
- Nice to meet you.

27
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:36,704
Well, nice to meet you too.

28
00:01:38,039 --> 00:01:39,165
You are so cute.

29
00:01:39,332 --> 00:01:43,169
Now I see where Frasier
got those gorgeous eyes.

30
00:01:43,336 --> 00:01:47,215
And this is Daphne Moon,
my father's home-healthcare worker.

31
00:01:47,382 --> 00:01:48,758
Hello.

32
00:01:48,925 --> 00:01:50,510
Are you gonna join us for breakfast?

33
00:01:50,718 --> 00:01:52,553
Oh, I could go for an English muffin.

34
00:01:52,762 --> 00:01:55,056
Perhaps our own English muffin
could fetch that for you.

35
00:01:58,059 --> 00:02:01,187
- Or I could get it.
- No, no, I'll get it myself.

36
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:04,190
Way to go, Fras. I like her.

37
00:02:04,357 --> 00:02:05,691
Gee, I wonder why.

38
00:02:05,858 --> 00:02:09,654
"Now I see where Frasier
gets those gorgeous eyes."

39
00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:12,823
Niles.

40
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:15,910
Hurry up and get dressed.
Frasier, we'll lose our court.

41
00:02:16,118 --> 00:02:17,912
I must warn you,
I may be unbeatable today.

42
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:20,373
Our squash pro, Octavio,
taught me a backhand slice

43
00:02:20,539 --> 00:02:23,209
that could shave
the bristles off a kiwi fruit.

44
00:02:23,417 --> 00:02:26,879
Niles, I'm afraid we may
have to reschedule today.

45
00:02:27,046 --> 00:02:29,340
You see, I had a date last night.

46
00:02:29,507 --> 00:02:32,093
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Yeah...

47
00:02:33,052 --> 00:02:34,887
Hey, but there's no sense
moping around.

48
00:02:35,095 --> 00:02:36,764
Game of squash
is the best thing for you.

49
00:02:36,931 --> 00:02:38,974
I can't think of a better way
to lift your spirits.

50
00:02:39,141 --> 00:02:41,560
- Good morning.
- Keep thinking.

51
00:02:48,609 --> 00:02:51,236
I tell you, Roz, the entire evening
was pure magic.

52
00:02:51,403 --> 00:02:52,947
Well, I'm happy for you.

53
00:02:53,113 --> 00:02:54,823
You have been in a dry spell,
haven't you?

54
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:57,660
Oh, no, Roz. Actually, that was just
the calm before the storm.

55
00:02:57,826 --> 00:03:03,165
I assure you, we are in the midst
of a full-blown love hurricane.

56
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:07,586
You were so much easier to be around
when you were horny and pathetic.

57
00:03:08,128 --> 00:03:10,297
I'm sorry. I have been
monopolising the conversation.

58
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:12,508
So, what's going on with you?

59
00:03:12,716 --> 00:03:16,345
Well, actually,
it has been a really exciting week.

60
00:03:16,512 --> 00:03:19,014
Of course, Alice's first birthday party
is this Sunday,

61
00:03:19,473 --> 00:03:21,600
and we're having 12
of her little friends over.

62
00:03:21,808 --> 00:03:23,435
She loves bears,

63
00:03:23,602 --> 00:03:25,520
so the whole party's gonna be
this bear theme:

64
00:03:25,687 --> 00:03:28,190
Party favours, bear cake.

65
00:03:28,357 --> 00:03:31,318
I'm gonna dress up like a bear, I think,
and do a little bear dance.

66
00:03:36,031 --> 00:03:37,783
That's really great
about you and Cassandra.

67
00:03:37,949 --> 00:03:40,786
Yes, yes. We're really
hitting it off, I think.

68
00:03:40,952 --> 00:03:42,537
Frasier?

69
00:03:43,246 --> 00:03:44,998
- Faye.
- Hi.

70
00:03:45,207 --> 00:03:47,292
Oh, my God.

71
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:48,794
Hey.

72
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,962
Hi, it's been a while.

73
00:03:51,129 --> 00:03:53,757
Gosh, oh, Faye Moskowitz,
this is my producer, Roz Doyle.

74
00:03:53,924 --> 00:03:55,091
- Hey.
- How are you?

75
00:03:55,258 --> 00:03:57,844
So, what have you been up to?

76
00:03:58,053 --> 00:03:59,387
Well, I just got back from Paris.

77
00:03:59,554 --> 00:04:01,890
Really? I didn't even know
you'd gone.

78
00:04:02,098 --> 00:04:03,183
You didn't get my message?

79
00:04:03,391 --> 00:04:05,060
Oh, Frasier, before I forget,
Faye called.

80
00:04:05,226 --> 00:04:07,479
She's going to France for a month.

81
00:04:07,938 --> 00:04:09,939
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

82
00:04:10,148 --> 00:04:11,191
It's great to see you.

83
00:04:11,358 --> 00:04:14,277
- We should get together for coffee.
- I'd love to.

84
00:04:14,486 --> 00:04:16,363
I'm on my way out.
Why don't you take my seat?

85
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:19,032
- Thanks, if that's all right with you.
- Of course.

86
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,494
Great. Well, I'll put some money
in my meter.

87
00:04:23,286 --> 00:04:25,330
What are you doing?
I can't have coffee with her.

88
00:04:25,497 --> 00:04:27,832
Why not?
Obviously, she's still interested.

89
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:29,834
I'm seeing Cassandra,
for God's sakes.

90
00:04:30,001 --> 00:04:31,753
I can't date two people at once.

91
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,130
Well, it doesn't have
to be on the same night.

92
00:04:34,297 --> 00:04:37,258
If you're good at faking a headache,
don't mind getting changed in the car...

93
00:04:37,425 --> 00:04:38,801
Roz.

94
00:04:39,052 --> 00:04:42,555
Well, did you tell Cassandra
you were gonna be exclusive to her?

95
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:44,182
No.

96
00:04:44,349 --> 00:04:46,309
So then you're just dating.

97
00:04:46,476 --> 00:04:50,063
Relax. It's supposed to be fun.
Just see where it takes you.

98
00:04:50,229 --> 00:04:52,899
That sort of lifestyle's all right
for some people but not for me.

99
00:04:53,524 --> 00:04:57,695
I'm a one-woman man, if that.

100
00:04:58,571 --> 00:05:00,364
Okay, suit yourself. Keep it platonic.

101
00:05:00,531 --> 00:05:02,533
Well, that's easy for you to say.

102
00:05:02,742 --> 00:05:04,952
How do you tell somebody
that you're attracted to them

103
00:05:05,119 --> 00:05:06,704
but you just can't sleep with them?

104
00:05:06,913 --> 00:05:09,165
I guess you just say...

105
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:12,126
You just say...

106
00:05:12,293 --> 00:05:14,545
I'll ask around.

107
00:05:16,756 --> 00:05:18,299
You know what I feel like
this morning?

108
00:05:18,466 --> 00:05:20,217
Some French toast
and sausage patties.

109
00:05:20,384 --> 00:05:23,179
- Here's your bran flakes.
- Oh, fine.

110
00:05:29,352 --> 00:05:31,312
Oh, hot.

111
00:05:34,732 --> 00:05:36,525
You're not giving him any toast,
are you?

112
00:05:36,692 --> 00:05:38,611
Of course not.

113
00:05:40,696 --> 00:05:41,739
- Oh, morning.
- Oh, hey.

114
00:05:41,906 --> 00:05:44,658
- Morning.
- I didn't hear you come in last night.

115
00:05:44,867 --> 00:05:45,951
Did you have a date?

116
00:05:49,121 --> 00:05:50,456
Well, I guess that answers that.

117
00:05:50,623 --> 00:05:53,459
Well, ease up there.
Cassandra's a great gal.

118
00:05:53,626 --> 00:05:55,794
Women like her
don't come along every day.

119
00:05:56,003 --> 00:05:57,296
Morning.

120
00:05:57,504 --> 00:05:59,632
No, they certainly don't.

121
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,594
Dad, Daphne, you remember Faye?

122
00:06:03,761 --> 00:06:06,430
- Hi, Martin, it's good to see you again.
- Oh, yeah, likewise.

123
00:06:06,638 --> 00:06:08,390
And, Daphne, you look gorgeous.

124
00:06:08,557 --> 00:06:10,809
Did you get your hair cut
since the last time I saw you?

125
00:06:11,018 --> 00:06:13,020
Oh, yes, I did. Thank you.

126
00:06:13,187 --> 00:06:15,606
Can I fix you some breakfast?

127
00:06:17,524 --> 00:06:19,651
I have really gotta run.
I'm running late.

128
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:23,113
I have to call my friend at the museum
to get tickets for that Seurat exhibit.

129
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,784
- I just hope it's not sold out.
- Well, if it is, que Seurat Seurat.

130
00:06:27,951 --> 00:06:29,578
Yeah, that was funnier the first time.

131
00:06:29,745 --> 00:06:31,371
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

132
00:06:33,582 --> 00:06:35,000
What happened to Cassandra?

133
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:36,960
Obviously, he dumped her
for someone better.

134
00:06:37,169 --> 00:06:39,504
I haven't dumped anyone.

135
00:06:39,713 --> 00:06:41,298
You mean you're dating
both of them?

136
00:06:41,506 --> 00:06:43,884
Oh, no, I didn't intend to.
It's just that, well...

137
00:06:44,051 --> 00:06:46,386
I ran into Faye. I was about to tell her
about Cassandra.

138
00:06:46,553 --> 00:06:48,805
It's just that we were enjoying
our coffee so much

139
00:06:48,972 --> 00:06:52,559
that coffee turned into dinner,
and then dinner turned into drinks,

140
00:06:52,726 --> 00:06:58,482
and then drinks turned into,
well, coffee again.

141
00:06:59,524 --> 00:07:03,028
Damn, I completely forgot
I rescheduled squash with Niles.

142
00:07:03,737 --> 00:07:06,448
Don't be angry at me
for still being in my robe.

143
00:07:07,198 --> 00:07:09,200
I won't. I wish I were in mine.

144
00:07:09,409 --> 00:07:11,369
Cassandra, what a surprise.

145
00:07:11,578 --> 00:07:14,080
- I brought you some pastries.
- Isn't that thoughtful of you?

146
00:07:14,247 --> 00:07:16,624
- Here we are.
- Hi, Martin, Dixie.

147
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:18,209
Cassandra! It's...

148
00:07:18,418 --> 00:07:20,628
You know, I'd love it
if you could stay.

149
00:07:20,795 --> 00:07:22,797
I've got to go pick up my brother
for squash.

150
00:07:22,964 --> 00:07:26,509
- Morning, all.
- Well, isn't that a timesaver.

151
00:07:27,635 --> 00:07:29,637
You know, I've still gotta go
get dressed anyway.

152
00:07:29,804 --> 00:07:31,764
And I'll just see you
back at the station.

153
00:07:31,931 --> 00:07:34,267
- Okay. All right. Have a good game.
- All right. Bye.

154
00:07:34,434 --> 00:07:36,936
Oh, you know, I'll just use
the powder room before I go.

155
00:07:37,103 --> 00:07:38,980
Yeah.

156
00:07:40,023 --> 00:07:42,400
This is a disaster!

157
00:07:43,443 --> 00:07:45,236
- What is?
- Hi, Niles.

158
00:07:45,445 --> 00:07:47,655
Oh, I'm up to speed.

159
00:07:52,869 --> 00:07:55,079
- Morning.
- Well, I guess I'll just be...

160
00:07:56,247 --> 00:07:58,332
- What?
- We just noticed:

161
00:07:58,499 --> 00:08:01,586
There's a nest of baby hummingbirds
on the balcony,

162
00:08:02,837 --> 00:08:05,840
and we're just keeping
our voices down. You run along.

163
00:08:06,007 --> 00:08:07,884
Hummingbirds made it
to the 19th floor?

164
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:12,096
Yes, well, they're
Himalayan mountain hummers.

165
00:08:12,263 --> 00:08:17,310
- They're very rare. Bye-bye.
- Okay. I'll see you later.

166
00:08:22,356 --> 00:08:25,401
- What are you doing?
- I was just standing guard.

167
00:08:25,568 --> 00:08:28,446
You know, the door is...
The lock's broken on it.

168
00:08:28,613 --> 00:08:32,616
Sometimes Dad
just wanders in, you know.

169
00:08:33,492 --> 00:08:34,994
Well, I know you've got your game.

170
00:08:35,202 --> 00:08:36,871
- I'll just get out of your hair.
- Right.

171
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:39,290
- Goodbye, everyone.
- Bye.

172
00:08:39,498 --> 00:08:41,375
Aren't I gonna get a hug first?
Come on.

173
00:08:41,542 --> 00:08:43,627
Oh, of course.

174
00:08:43,836 --> 00:08:44,920
Are you all right?

175
00:08:45,087 --> 00:08:49,216
Oh, yes. It's just, you're so hard
to say goodbye to.

176
00:08:51,635 --> 00:08:53,345
Well, time's a-wasting. Off you go.

177
00:08:54,054 --> 00:08:56,932
- Bye-bye.
- All right.

178
00:09:00,894 --> 00:09:03,022
Got any more hiding
in the grotto, Hef?

179
00:09:04,023 --> 00:09:05,733
Oh, for God's sakes.

180
00:09:05,899 --> 00:09:08,319
Oh, I'm just not up
to this sort of thing.

181
00:09:08,485 --> 00:09:10,904
What made me think I could juggle?

182
00:09:11,113 --> 00:09:14,324
I sure as hell don't know. You couldn't
catch a balloon till you were 10.

183
00:09:16,326 --> 00:09:18,328
Yes, thank you, Dad.

184
00:09:18,537 --> 00:09:19,788
My problem is that each of them

185
00:09:19,955 --> 00:09:22,207
appeals to different sides
of my personality.

186
00:09:22,374 --> 00:09:26,670
Faye is artistic and cerebral
and cultured.

187
00:09:26,837 --> 00:09:30,507
And Cassandra is passionate
and fun and spontaneous.

188
00:09:30,716 --> 00:09:32,259
Well, my vote sure goes
for Cassandra.

189
00:09:32,426 --> 00:09:34,303
Oh, you would say that.

190
00:09:34,511 --> 00:09:36,263
Any young woman who shows you
any attention,

191
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:39,391
you're ready to sign
over your pension cheque.

192
00:09:39,558 --> 00:09:42,144
- I think he should go for Faye.
- Oh, Faye, Faye.

193
00:09:42,311 --> 00:09:46,857
If he wants some boring, artsy-fartsy
conversation he's got Niles.

194
00:09:50,819 --> 00:09:52,779
Yes, well, my point is
I am really torn here.

195
00:09:52,946 --> 00:09:56,032
I feel as if I honestly cannot choose.

196
00:09:56,241 --> 00:09:58,952
I think I might be able
to help you with this.

197
00:09:59,411 --> 00:10:01,621
Heads, it's Faye. Tails, Cassandra.

198
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:06,084
Oh, this is the sort of thing that makes
a woman feel really special.

199
00:10:06,585 --> 00:10:09,421
You're gonna flip a coin? The decision
cannot be made that simply.

200
00:10:09,588 --> 00:10:11,006
It's not gonna be that simple.

201
00:10:11,214 --> 00:10:12,883
The chances of Niles
catching that quarter

202
00:10:13,049 --> 00:10:15,260
- are about the same as you...
- Enough, Dad!

203
00:10:17,929 --> 00:10:22,559
Just go with me on this, Frasier.
Heads, it's Faye. Tails, Cassandra.

204
00:10:28,606 --> 00:10:30,734
And the winner is...

205
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:34,070
Admit it. You want me
to say one name more than the other.

206
00:10:34,988 --> 00:10:36,906
Niles, you're right, I do. Cassandra.

207
00:10:37,115 --> 00:10:38,867
Yes!

208
00:10:39,993 --> 00:10:42,036
- There you have it.
- Thank you. Thank you, Niles.

209
00:10:42,203 --> 00:10:44,247
Well, what a relief.

210
00:10:44,414 --> 00:10:48,334
You know, my life was perfectly happy
before Faye came back, you know.

211
00:10:48,501 --> 00:10:52,005
Yes, it's Cassandra. She's the one.

212
00:10:52,171 --> 00:10:55,842
Next time I see Faye,
I'll just have to tell her it's over.

213
00:10:56,217 --> 00:10:58,886
Oh, gosh, Niles, I'm sorry.
I'm afraid we've lost our court again.

214
00:10:59,053 --> 00:11:00,680
Do you mind rescheduling
just once more?

215
00:11:00,888 --> 00:11:03,349
- All right, that's fine.
- I gotta hand it to you, Frasier.

216
00:11:03,558 --> 00:11:05,560
You had a tough decision to make
but you made it.

217
00:11:05,727 --> 00:11:09,439
Heck, I can't even decide whether to
have the strawberry or the grape jelly.

218
00:11:09,605 --> 00:11:11,149
Dad, I still have my trusty quarter.

219
00:11:11,315 --> 00:11:13,609
Let's say heads, grape.
Tails, strawberry.

220
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:19,490
Niles, Niles!

221
00:11:19,657 --> 00:11:21,909
Are you all right?

222
00:11:26,372 --> 00:11:29,667
You gotta wonder what goes on
on that squash court.

223
00:11:33,587 --> 00:11:35,256
You know what I could go for
this morning?

224
00:11:35,423 --> 00:11:37,049
A big old Spanish omelette.

225
00:11:37,216 --> 00:11:39,635
Here's your bran flakes.

226
00:11:40,428 --> 00:11:41,470
What's that?

227
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:43,931
Your yellow bowl broke
in the dishwasher.

228
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:46,350
- Well, don't you have another one?
- Afraid not.

229
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:50,521
Well, red, yellow,
what difference does it make?

230
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,066
- Oh, excuse me.
- Sorry.

231
00:12:01,699 --> 00:12:03,492
Oh, hot.

232
00:12:08,205 --> 00:12:12,710
You know, I don't like this red bowl.
It's throwing everything off.

233
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:17,297
You know, I think we do have
another yellow bowl.

234
00:12:17,464 --> 00:12:20,050
Why don't you go and sit down,
and I'll fetch it for you?

235
00:12:20,217 --> 00:12:21,635
Okay.

236
00:12:23,303 --> 00:12:25,722
Back off. I need this.

237
00:12:27,224 --> 00:12:28,267
Oh, good morning, Dad.

238
00:12:28,434 --> 00:12:30,269
Everything go all right
with Faye last night?

239
00:12:30,435 --> 00:12:32,604
She didn't take the breakup
too hard, did she?

240
00:12:32,813 --> 00:12:34,982
- Not really.
- Well, I'm sure she realises,

241
00:12:35,148 --> 00:12:37,734
pretty as she is,
that she won't be alone for long.

242
00:12:38,944 --> 00:12:40,571
Good morning, Martin.

243
00:12:40,779 --> 00:12:42,781
What'd I tell you?

244
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:44,366
Hi, how you doing?

245
00:12:44,533 --> 00:12:45,742
I'll get this.

246
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:47,536
I had an incredible time last night.

247
00:12:47,703 --> 00:12:49,413
Me too.

248
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:53,959
Morning, all. Oh, forget it.

249
00:12:59,047 --> 00:13:01,049
- Niles.
- Frasier.

250
00:13:01,258 --> 00:13:03,844
I'm glad you're here. Listen,
I am so sorry about this morning.

251
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:07,430
Oh, not at all. I ended up playing
an exhilarating game with Chip Emory.

252
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:08,890
Won two out of three sets.

253
00:13:09,099 --> 00:13:11,601
And if you recall, Chip
was club champion four years running.

254
00:13:11,768 --> 00:13:16,189
Yes, and I also recall that that record
comes with an asterisk.

255
00:13:16,356 --> 00:13:20,819
I believe his streak was interrupted
by World War II.

256
00:13:24,864 --> 00:13:26,866
It was Korea, and you know it.

257
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:29,035
Can I have my usual, please?

258
00:13:29,244 --> 00:13:30,996
Why was Faye at your apartment
this morning?

259
00:13:31,162 --> 00:13:33,206
Well, actually, I almost made
a terrible mistake.

260
00:13:33,373 --> 00:13:35,625
Last night, I was prepared
to break things off with her,

261
00:13:35,792 --> 00:13:38,503
then we fell into this marvellous
conversation about architecture.

262
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:41,172
And as it turns out,
she detests the design

263
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:43,466
of the Bilbao Art Museum
as much as I do.

264
00:13:43,675 --> 00:13:46,511
- And you almost let her go.
- Yes, exactly.

265
00:13:46,678 --> 00:13:49,722
And, well, you know,
Cassandra's a wonderful woman, but...

266
00:13:49,889 --> 00:13:53,184
Well, Faye and I
have a deeper connection

267
00:13:53,351 --> 00:13:56,604
and to be fair, actually,
she was the first

268
00:13:56,771 --> 00:14:01,317
to plant her flag on "terra Frasier."

269
00:14:04,529 --> 00:14:07,031
I'm starting to think Napoleon
had a Frasier complex.

270
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,825
Yes, all right.

271
00:14:09,951 --> 00:14:11,369
Oh, there's Cassandra.

272
00:14:11,536 --> 00:14:13,538
I asked her here for coffee.
I was gonna tell her

273
00:14:13,704 --> 00:14:15,456
- that we can't see each other.
- Good luck.

274
00:14:15,623 --> 00:14:16,874
Thank you. Thank you, Niles.

275
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:18,501
- Cassandra?
- Hi, honey.

276
00:14:18,668 --> 00:14:20,294
Hi.

277
00:14:21,963 --> 00:14:23,256
Double espresso, please.

278
00:14:23,422 --> 00:14:25,132
- I have great news.
- Really?

279
00:14:25,299 --> 00:14:27,927
Those new promos
are working wonders.

280
00:14:28,135 --> 00:14:29,929
I just got the numbers,
and you're scoring

281
00:14:30,096 --> 00:14:33,558
with women between the ages
of 25 and 49.

282
00:14:33,766 --> 00:14:36,519
Well, that's not always a good thing.

283
00:14:37,812 --> 00:14:38,854
You all right?

284
00:14:39,021 --> 00:14:44,610
Actually, I wanted to talk to you
about our relationship.

285
00:14:45,152 --> 00:14:47,988
- You see, l...
- I know where we're going.

286
00:14:48,155 --> 00:14:50,324
A serious talk.

287
00:14:51,492 --> 00:14:53,494
You see, there comes a time
in every relationship

288
00:14:53,661 --> 00:14:55,454
- when you have to decide...
- I know.

289
00:14:55,663 --> 00:14:57,414
Whether we're going
to be exclusive or not.

290
00:14:57,581 --> 00:14:59,625
I've been wanting
to talk to you about that too.

291
00:14:59,834 --> 00:15:02,586
- You have?
- Yes, you see...

292
00:15:02,795 --> 00:15:05,381
I thought you should know
that I've been seeing someone else.

293
00:15:06,882 --> 00:15:08,342
Really?

294
00:15:08,551 --> 00:15:09,593
Does that bother you?

295
00:15:09,802 --> 00:15:13,264
No. No, no, no, actually, not at all.

296
00:15:13,973 --> 00:15:15,224
Oh, good.

297
00:15:15,391 --> 00:15:17,267
Anyway, what I wanted to say
was that...

298
00:15:17,434 --> 00:15:20,437
Well, how long you been seeing
this other fellow?

299
00:15:21,146 --> 00:15:22,940
Not very long.
You're not upset, are you?

300
00:15:23,107 --> 00:15:25,442
No, no, no. Actually,
I was about to say...

301
00:15:25,651 --> 00:15:27,820
Well, what does he do?

302
00:15:28,028 --> 00:15:30,072
He owns his own
venture-capital firm.

303
00:15:30,239 --> 00:15:32,699
Although he spends most of his time
racing sailboats

304
00:15:32,866 --> 00:15:35,577
and rebuilding trails
for the Sierra Club.

305
00:15:35,786 --> 00:15:38,497
Oh, really?
Seems a little unfocused, doesn't he?

306
00:15:40,707 --> 00:15:43,669
- You are upset, aren't you?
- No, no, no.

307
00:15:43,877 --> 00:15:46,964
Really, there's no reason
to be jealous of Sloane.

308
00:15:48,173 --> 00:15:52,511
Believe me,
I am not jealous of Sloane.

309
00:15:53,637 --> 00:15:56,473
If anything, I pity the man
who has to go through life

310
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,016
with a pretentious name like that.

311
00:15:58,225 --> 00:16:00,977
- Frasier.
- All right, fine, fine.

312
00:16:01,186 --> 00:16:03,772
You know what,
let's just drop the whole thing, all right?

313
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:06,149
Okay. Now,
about those new promos...

314
00:16:06,358 --> 00:16:09,569
- Cassandra, I want us to be exclusive.
- What?

315
00:16:09,778 --> 00:16:11,154
Yes, well, I'm the kind of person

316
00:16:11,321 --> 00:16:13,406
who can make a decision
and commit to it.

317
00:16:13,573 --> 00:16:16,284
And I was hoping that you might be
that sort of person too.

318
00:16:16,493 --> 00:16:19,496
Oh, Frasier, I'm so touched.

319
00:16:19,663 --> 00:16:22,290
If you only want us
to be with each other, that's great.

320
00:16:22,457 --> 00:16:26,294
I was supposed to see Sloane tonight,
but I'm gonna call him and cancel.

321
00:16:26,503 --> 00:16:28,255
Oh, that's wonderful.

322
00:16:28,421 --> 00:16:31,466
Oh, my God. That means
we can spend the night together.

323
00:16:42,936 --> 00:16:46,272
Looks like she took the news well.
Are you insane?

324
00:16:46,773 --> 00:16:49,192
Niles, I almost made
a terrible mistake.

325
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,443
What could have happened

326
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:52,779
in the last four minutes
to make you change your mind?

327
00:16:52,946 --> 00:16:55,281
When Cassandra told me
that she was seeing somebody else,

328
00:16:55,448 --> 00:16:56,908
it awakened something in me.

329
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:59,202
- Oh, petty jealousy?
- No.

330
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:01,454
The realisation that I couldn't bear
to lose her.

331
00:17:01,663 --> 00:17:03,665
The minute you see Faye,
you'll reverse again.

332
00:17:03,831 --> 00:17:07,627
No. No, I won't. I'll prove it to you.

333
00:17:07,835 --> 00:17:11,714
Cassandra is the one. I'm sure of it.

334
00:17:14,217 --> 00:17:15,259
Her machine.

335
00:17:15,843 --> 00:17:18,054
Yes, Faye, it's Frasier.

336
00:17:18,638 --> 00:17:21,891
Listen, I won't be able to join you
for dinner tonight.

337
00:17:22,058 --> 00:17:26,062
But perhaps you could call me later.

338
00:17:26,229 --> 00:17:28,314
We need to talk.

339
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:31,901
There, I've done it.

340
00:17:32,443 --> 00:17:36,197
Nothing says it's over between us
quite like the phrase:

341
00:17:36,364 --> 00:17:37,782
"We need to talk."

342
00:17:38,783 --> 00:17:41,202
That was my problem, actually.
I kept leaving the door open.

343
00:17:41,369 --> 00:17:43,329
- I'm very proud of you.
- Thank you, Niles.

344
00:17:43,537 --> 00:17:46,832
An enlightened man is he
who can learn from his mistakes.

345
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:48,042
Squash tomorrow morning?

346
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:50,336
- 9 a.m., my place?
- See you there.

347
00:17:54,632 --> 00:17:59,720
Well, I called him.
I probably should feel guilty.

348
00:17:59,887 --> 00:18:01,722
I'm just so glad
it's just the two of us now.

349
00:18:01,889 --> 00:18:03,599
I'm ecstatic.

350
00:18:03,808 --> 00:18:06,477
I know a cute little bed-and-breakfast
we can go to this weekend.

351
00:18:06,644 --> 00:18:08,145
Oh, really?

352
00:18:08,312 --> 00:18:09,522
Thank you.

353
00:18:10,147 --> 00:18:13,275
<i>What a relief this is.
I've made my choice.</i>

354
00:18:13,776 --> 00:18:16,737
<i>Look at her. I've found an angel.</i>

355
00:18:19,949 --> 00:18:23,035
<i>An angel who wears
an awful lot of makeup.</i>

356
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:24,578
<i>I've never noticed that before.</i>

357
00:18:24,745 --> 00:18:27,373
<i>Faye doesn't paint her face up
like that.</i>

358
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:31,627
And they have the cutest
little four-poster beds in each room.

359
00:18:31,835 --> 00:18:33,796
That sounds lovely.

360
00:18:33,962 --> 00:18:37,591
<i>My, she uses the word "cute" a lot.</i>

361
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:41,970
<i>I'm cute. This cafe is cute.
Now the bed is cute.</i>

362
00:18:42,137 --> 00:18:46,099
<i>Faye used the word
"jejune" last night.</i>

363
00:18:48,018 --> 00:18:50,354
Oh, you know, I meant to tell you.

364
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:53,440
I really liked how you handled
that nasty caller yesterday.

365
00:18:53,607 --> 00:18:55,400
It was such a clever way...

366
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:59,738
<i>God, all she talks about
is work, work, work.</i>

367
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:02,574
<i>And now I'll see her
every morning before work,</i>

368
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:05,369
<i>and at work, and after work.</i>

369
00:19:05,535 --> 00:19:08,372
<i>I feel trapped.</i>

370
00:19:08,538 --> 00:19:10,957
<i>I can't breathe.</i>

371
00:19:11,124 --> 00:19:14,711
<i>Wait, what are you doing?
It's just your fear talking.</i>

372
00:19:14,878 --> 00:19:18,715
<i>She's a wonderful woman.
She's the one. She's perfect.</i>

373
00:19:18,882 --> 00:19:23,762
And then I ran into Roz after the show,
and she told me the cutest little story...

374
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:27,390
Cassandra, we need to talk.

375
00:19:33,021 --> 00:19:35,523
- Frasier?
- Faye, hi.

376
00:19:35,982 --> 00:19:38,276
- We really need to talk.
- I know, I got your message.

377
00:19:38,443 --> 00:19:41,738
- I thought you couldn't see me tonight.
- Well, I had some unfinished business

378
00:19:41,905 --> 00:19:46,409
with the Promotions Department,
but that's all done now.

379
00:19:46,576 --> 00:19:48,828
I wish you would've called.
I would've put something on.

380
00:19:48,995 --> 00:19:50,622
No, no, you look beautiful.

381
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:56,127
Listen, Faye,
I want us to be exclusive.

382
00:19:57,086 --> 00:19:58,129
What?

383
00:19:58,338 --> 00:20:00,507
Yes, I wanna take our relationship
to the next level.

384
00:20:00,673 --> 00:20:02,967
I just wanna be with you.

385
00:20:04,219 --> 00:20:05,762
I'm a little surprised.

386
00:20:05,929 --> 00:20:07,972
You said, "We need to talk"
on the machine,

387
00:20:08,139 --> 00:20:10,767
and, you know,
that usually means it's over.

388
00:20:10,975 --> 00:20:13,978
Really? I had no idea.

389
00:20:15,355 --> 00:20:17,148
Well, this is wonderful.

390
00:20:17,357 --> 00:20:18,900
Oh, my God.

391
00:20:19,067 --> 00:20:22,278
Oh, God, so it's just you and me.

392
00:20:22,445 --> 00:20:23,905
God, this is exhilarating.

393
00:20:24,072 --> 00:20:26,157
Oh, this is turning out
to be the best day ever.

394
00:20:26,365 --> 00:20:29,035
Because... Well, okay,
Chris McKenna, the restaurant critic,

395
00:20:29,243 --> 00:20:31,078
he comes over to the restaurant
this morning...

396
00:20:31,245 --> 00:20:37,251
<i>What is she thinking
with that ridiculous shirt? Tie-dye?</i>

397
00:20:37,418 --> 00:20:40,463
<i>Stop it, Frasier.
You can't do this to yourself.</i>

398
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:43,174
<i>This is nothing more
than the natural panic</i>

399
00:20:43,341 --> 00:20:44,926
<i>of finally making your choice.</i>

400
00:20:45,092 --> 00:20:46,594
- That the printer had messed up

401
00:20:46,802 --> 00:20:50,097
and the menu said "flab"
instead of "flan."

402
00:20:51,307 --> 00:20:53,476
That is so precious.

403
00:20:53,684 --> 00:20:55,561
<i>And so is she.</i>

404
00:20:56,103 --> 00:20:59,357
<i>Precious. My Faye.</i>

405
00:20:59,982 --> 00:21:03,527
<i>Faye as in favourite.</i>

406
00:21:03,694 --> 00:21:06,447
<i>This feels so much better
now that I've relaxed.</i>

407
00:21:06,614 --> 00:21:08,407
<i>I was about to doom
this whole relationship</i>

408
00:21:08,574 --> 00:21:10,493
<i>with my neurotic nitpicking.</i>

409
00:21:10,659 --> 00:21:12,745
<i>But it's clear sailing now.</i>

410
00:21:12,912 --> 00:21:14,830
Well, enough about me.
How was your day?

411
00:21:14,997 --> 00:21:18,667
Well, it certainly ended well.

412
00:21:18,834 --> 00:21:21,879
Although, you know, something funny
did happen at the station.

413
00:21:22,046 --> 00:21:24,256
It was during the second hour
of my show.

414
00:21:24,465 --> 00:21:27,718
<i>My God, he really does love
to talk about himself.</i>

415
00:21:28,886 --> 00:21:34,141
<i>Is that another new pair of shoes?
He's got more shoes than I do.</i>

416
00:21:34,308 --> 00:21:36,226
- Didn't really work out, but...
