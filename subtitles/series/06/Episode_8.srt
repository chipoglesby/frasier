1
00:00:09,785 --> 00:00:11,918
- Hello.
- Hey, how was your afternoon?

2
00:00:11,985 --> 00:00:13,585
Do you know
what this wonderful man did?

3
00:00:13,785 --> 00:00:15,451
Oh, Daphne, please don't...

4
00:00:15,651 --> 00:00:18,785
He filled a basket
full of me favourite English foods:

5
00:00:18,918 --> 00:00:21,585
Blood pudding,
jellied eels, kidney pie.

6
00:00:21,785 --> 00:00:23,585
Then he hid it in the shrubs

7
00:00:23,785 --> 00:00:26,118
so we'd stumble upon it
during our stroll through the park.

8
00:00:26,251 --> 00:00:28,785
I was afraid that somebody
would find it before we got there,

9
00:00:28,918 --> 00:00:30,451
but fortunately, untouched.

10
00:00:30,585 --> 00:00:33,918
Yes. Just because it was untouched
doesn't mean someone didn't find it.

11
00:00:35,651 --> 00:00:37,251
- Hello, Dr. Crane.
- Hello, Daphne.

12
00:00:37,518 --> 00:00:38,585
Donny.

13
00:00:39,785 --> 00:00:43,318
Hey, tiger.
Look what I got for you. Think fast.

14
00:00:45,985 --> 00:00:49,318
- What are the keys to?
- Your ex-wife's lakefront cottage.

15
00:00:49,585 --> 00:00:51,451
Now your lakefront cottage.

16
00:00:51,651 --> 00:00:54,251
A little something I hammered out
for you in the settlement.

17
00:00:54,451 --> 00:00:56,985
Thank you. Donny, I never thought
I'd see Shady Glen again.

18
00:00:57,851 --> 00:00:58,985
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

19
00:00:59,185 --> 00:01:00,985
Well, congratulations, Niles.

20
00:01:01,185 --> 00:01:04,651
Yeah, looks like Donny really did a job
on Maris' legal team.

21
00:01:04,918 --> 00:01:06,985
Yes, well, he certainly is ruthless,
all right.

22
00:01:07,185 --> 00:01:08,585
As a divorce lawyer,

23
00:01:08,851 --> 00:01:12,451
what a callous attitude he must have
toward human relationships.

24
00:01:12,651 --> 00:01:15,651
Yeah, you'd think so, Dr. Crane,
but actually, it's just the opposite.

25
00:01:15,851 --> 00:01:17,985
I've never met anyone
so incredibly romantic.

26
00:01:18,185 --> 00:01:20,518
Yes, well, I'm sure
he seems that way on the outside.

27
00:01:20,651 --> 00:01:22,985
Oh, Niles, please.

28
00:01:23,185 --> 00:01:25,651
It's unseemly enough
when she's actually in the room.

29
00:01:25,851 --> 00:01:28,518
I'm sorry.
What am I supposed to do?

30
00:01:28,651 --> 00:01:30,251
For the first time
since I've known her,

31
00:01:30,451 --> 00:01:32,318
I'm free and single
and now she's with someone.

32
00:01:32,518 --> 00:01:35,251
- I'm supposed to suffer in silence?
- I'd take that.

33
00:01:36,851 --> 00:01:39,518
I just don't understand.
What does she see in him?

34
00:01:39,651 --> 00:01:41,451
If you were Daphne,
would you go out with Donny?

35
00:01:41,651 --> 00:01:44,785
Well, no, but I wouldn't massage
Dad's ass for what I pay her either.

36
00:01:48,118 --> 00:01:49,118
Look, I'm sorry, Niles.

37
00:01:49,318 --> 00:01:51,318
Donny and Daphne
seem very happy together.

38
00:01:51,451 --> 00:01:54,785
Either it's true love, in which case
it's too late for you to declare yourself,

39
00:01:54,918 --> 00:01:56,518
or it's just a temporary infatuation.

40
00:01:56,651 --> 00:01:59,318
- It's got to be. It's got to be.
- In which case, it will pass.

41
00:01:59,518 --> 00:02:01,518
And then you can make your move.

42
00:02:01,785 --> 00:02:05,918
In the meantime, I suggest that maybe
you start looking elsewhere.

43
00:02:06,118 --> 00:02:07,518
You know, maybe make a fresh start.

44
00:02:07,651 --> 00:02:09,985
Do something
to get your mind off of Daphne.

45
00:02:10,185 --> 00:02:12,118
I know, I know, it's just difficult.

46
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:14,585
Yes, I understand.
Say, you know what? I've got an idea.

47
00:02:14,851 --> 00:02:17,651
Why don't the three of us go to
that cabin of yours for the weekend?

48
00:02:17,851 --> 00:02:20,451
Sorry, I can't. I got a dentist
appointment Saturday morning.

49
00:02:20,585 --> 00:02:22,918
Niles can go up on Friday night,
put things together,

50
00:02:23,118 --> 00:02:25,251
and then you and I can drive up
on Saturday afternoon.

51
00:02:25,585 --> 00:02:27,251
Why not? It's a fabulous place, Dad.

52
00:02:27,451 --> 00:02:30,518
It's got a stereo and a big-screen TV
and a sauna, wine cellar.

53
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:33,785
Perfect for three guys
roughing it in the wilderness.

54
00:02:34,185 --> 00:02:35,585
Well, I'm game.

55
00:02:35,851 --> 00:02:37,851
I can stop at the butcher,
pick up a couple of ducks

56
00:02:38,118 --> 00:02:40,185
and make my justly celebrated
duck à I'orange.

57
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:43,251
Washed down with
a winsome-yet-robust Chambertin.

58
00:02:43,451 --> 00:02:44,518
- Chambertin.
- Yeah.

59
00:02:44,651 --> 00:02:46,785
I'll bring a quart of whisky
in case of snakebite.

60
00:02:46,918 --> 00:02:48,651
Dad, Dad,
there are no snakes up there.

61
00:02:48,851 --> 00:02:51,185
All right, I'll bring a snake.

62
00:02:52,451 --> 00:02:55,451
God, this is great, Niles.
I've gotta dash down to the mailbox,

63
00:02:55,585 --> 00:02:57,451
drop that letter in
before the last pick-up.

64
00:02:57,585 --> 00:02:59,651
Niles, trust me.

65
00:02:59,918 --> 00:03:01,985
You'll be glad
you took my advice on this one.

66
00:03:02,185 --> 00:03:03,318
I already am. Thank you.

67
00:03:03,451 --> 00:03:06,318
It's going to do me a world of good
to get away from Daphne for a while.

68
00:03:06,518 --> 00:03:07,785
Yes, I couldn't agree more.

69
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:11,118
Hey, Daphne, how would you like
to see my new lakefront cottage?

70
00:03:11,251 --> 00:03:13,651
- Sounds lovely. When?
- This weekend.

71
00:03:13,918 --> 00:03:15,785
We're all going.
You can drive with me on Friday

72
00:03:15,918 --> 00:03:17,651
and Dad and Frasier
will be right behind.

73
00:03:17,785 --> 00:03:20,318
Oh, that's very sweet, Dr. Crane.
But I can't.

74
00:03:20,451 --> 00:03:22,785
One of me cousins is going
to San Francisco this weekend

75
00:03:22,918 --> 00:03:24,318
and I promised I'd fly down.

76
00:03:24,585 --> 00:03:26,318
- That's a shame.
- Yeah.

77
00:03:26,585 --> 00:03:28,185
Donny's not too thrilled
about it either.

78
00:03:28,451 --> 00:03:31,118
- He wanted to come with me.
- And he's not?

79
00:03:31,318 --> 00:03:34,518
No, that would have meant
staying in a hotel together,

80
00:03:34,785 --> 00:03:36,585
and I'm not sure
we're ready for that yet.

81
00:03:37,185 --> 00:03:39,585
I suppose you think
I'm being a bit old-fashioned.

82
00:03:39,785 --> 00:03:42,451
Dear God in heaven, no.

83
00:03:42,985 --> 00:03:44,518
You can't force these things.

84
00:03:44,651 --> 00:03:47,318
You have to wait for the moment
when you know it's right.

85
00:03:47,585 --> 00:03:51,251
And sometimes the moment never
comes and you just have to move on.

86
00:03:51,518 --> 00:03:54,585
I really appreciate the invitation
and I hope you'll invite me again.

87
00:03:54,851 --> 00:03:57,585
All right, Daphne, how would you like
to see my new lakefront cottage?

88
00:03:57,851 --> 00:03:58,851
You're silly.

89
00:04:08,118 --> 00:04:09,918
- Martin, Niles.
- Hey.

90
00:04:09,985 --> 00:04:12,918
- Boy, this place is jammed.
- Here, Roz, you can have my seat.

91
00:04:13,118 --> 00:04:14,585
- I'm on my way to Duke's.
- Thank you.

92
00:04:14,785 --> 00:04:17,651
Yeah.
So how's the world treating you?

93
00:04:17,851 --> 00:04:19,318
Like dirt.

94
00:04:19,518 --> 00:04:21,918
My social life is non-existent.

95
00:04:22,185 --> 00:04:23,918
Every time I meet a guy
who's halfway decent,

96
00:04:24,118 --> 00:04:25,918
all I have to do
is mention I got a kid

97
00:04:26,118 --> 00:04:29,251
and he runs
like a cheap pair of pantyhose.

98
00:04:29,318 --> 00:04:31,585
Well, maybe you and Niles
can cheer each other up.

99
00:04:31,851 --> 00:04:33,518
- Dad.
- Why, what's his problem?

100
00:04:33,651 --> 00:04:35,918
Daphne's got a new boyfriend
and it's eating him up.

101
00:04:36,185 --> 00:04:38,451
- Dad.
- What? You got a thing for Daphne?

102
00:04:38,585 --> 00:04:40,251
You didn't know that
after all these years?

103
00:04:40,518 --> 00:04:42,118
No, I can't believe
Daphne never told me.

104
00:04:42,251 --> 00:04:43,918
How could she?
She doesn't know either.

105
00:04:44,185 --> 00:04:46,651
- You're kidding.
- Yes. Yes, he's a great kidder.

106
00:04:46,851 --> 00:04:50,318
Now, you, Dad, run along and you
be very careful crossing streets.

107
00:04:50,518 --> 00:04:52,185
Six years, can you believe it?

108
00:04:52,318 --> 00:04:54,985
Some people just don't even know
when it's time to pull the plug.

109
00:04:55,185 --> 00:04:58,318
Well, I won't make
that mistake twice.

110
00:04:59,251 --> 00:05:00,985
So let me get this straight.

111
00:05:01,185 --> 00:05:02,785
You've been hot for Daphne
all this time

112
00:05:02,918 --> 00:05:04,585
and you've never made a move?

113
00:05:04,785 --> 00:05:07,518
- I was a happily married man.
- You were never happy.

114
00:05:07,651 --> 00:05:09,918
And you've been separated
for almost two years.

115
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:13,185
Well, somehow,
the right moment never came along.

116
00:05:13,318 --> 00:05:14,785
Oh, come on.

117
00:05:14,985 --> 00:05:19,785
I'm not trying to make you feel bad,
it's just, waiting all this time,

118
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:22,785
and now she's got a boyfriend.

119
00:05:22,918 --> 00:05:26,585
My God, that is really pathetic.

120
00:05:27,185 --> 00:05:28,585
Obviously, you've never let someone

121
00:05:28,785 --> 00:05:30,918
you've grown to care deeply about
get away.

122
00:05:31,118 --> 00:05:32,185
Well, sure I have.

123
00:05:32,451 --> 00:05:33,518
I'm not talking about

124
00:05:33,651 --> 00:05:36,318
when the migrant workers
leave at the end of the picking season.

125
00:05:41,118 --> 00:05:42,785
No, really.
I've had a couple of boyfriends

126
00:05:42,918 --> 00:05:44,918
I shouldn't have let get away.

127
00:05:45,118 --> 00:05:46,918
- Serious relationships?
- Yeah.

128
00:05:47,118 --> 00:05:48,918
I can name one
right off the top of my head.

129
00:05:48,985 --> 00:05:51,451
That lawyer I gave you, Donny.

130
00:05:51,585 --> 00:05:53,251
- Really?
- Yeah.

131
00:05:53,451 --> 00:05:55,651
I mean,
you only know him professionally,

132
00:05:55,851 --> 00:05:59,585
but he's very funny,
warm, thoughtful.

133
00:06:00,518 --> 00:06:02,251
We were together
for about six months,

134
00:06:02,451 --> 00:06:04,518
but he really wanted a family
and I wasn't ready

135
00:06:04,651 --> 00:06:05,918
so I dumped him.

136
00:06:05,985 --> 00:06:08,918
Now I have the family,
but no Donny.

137
00:06:09,185 --> 00:06:10,918
Gee, I wonder
who he's seeing these days.

138
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:17,318
- What's so funny?
- I'll tell you in a minute.

139
00:06:17,518 --> 00:06:20,451
I just want to savour it.
You've been having all the fun.

140
00:06:21,118 --> 00:06:22,451
So tell me.

141
00:06:23,251 --> 00:06:25,118
Donny is Daphne's boyfriend.

142
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:29,251
That's not funny.
When did this happen?

143
00:06:29,518 --> 00:06:32,185
Well, she met him
when he was working on my case.

144
00:06:33,185 --> 00:06:36,118
Wow, and I was calling you a loser.

145
00:06:36,318 --> 00:06:39,585
- You never called me a loser.
- In my head I did.

146
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:43,185
Well, at the moment,
I have to agree with you.

147
00:06:43,451 --> 00:06:47,651
I've had plenty of opportunities
and I always chickened out.

148
00:06:47,918 --> 00:06:49,851
Don't blame yourself.

149
00:06:49,985 --> 00:06:52,118
She's living with your brother,
working for your dad.

150
00:06:52,451 --> 00:06:55,251
- It's an awkward situation.
- It is.

151
00:06:55,451 --> 00:06:57,785
Well, don't feel bad about Donny.

152
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:00,651
It wasn't right for you at the time,
that's nobody's fault.

153
00:07:01,185 --> 00:07:02,651
Thanks, Niles.

154
00:07:03,851 --> 00:07:05,785
Listen, the next time
you find somebody you like,

155
00:07:05,985 --> 00:07:07,851
don't wait so long to tell her.

156
00:07:09,118 --> 00:07:10,651
I've got a babysitter waiting.

157
00:07:10,785 --> 00:07:13,251
Mrs. Hines is 70 years old,

158
00:07:13,451 --> 00:07:14,851
has a mole like Abe Lincoln,

159
00:07:14,918 --> 00:07:17,985
but I bet
she has plans for the weekend.

160
00:07:18,185 --> 00:07:21,318
You know what?
I just had the craziest idea.

161
00:07:21,518 --> 00:07:24,251
My settlement with Maris
includes a beautiful lakefront cottage,

162
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:26,785
and I'm going up there this afternoon.

163
00:07:26,918 --> 00:07:29,851
Why don't you come along?
You can bring Alice.

164
00:07:29,985 --> 00:07:31,118
Are you serious?

165
00:07:31,251 --> 00:07:33,118
Well, Frasier and Dad
are coming up tomorrow.

166
00:07:33,251 --> 00:07:34,851
But tonight, it'd just be us.

167
00:07:34,985 --> 00:07:38,251
Love's losers, licking our wounds,
laughing at our pain.

168
00:07:38,918 --> 00:07:40,785
Gee, I don't know, l...

169
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:43,785
Frasier's making duck à I'orange
and I'm bringing the wine.

170
00:07:43,918 --> 00:07:45,585
What about it?

171
00:07:45,785 --> 00:07:48,985
I never thought I'd say this,
but you're on.

172
00:07:51,185 --> 00:07:52,451
In a funny way, this reminds me

173
00:07:52,585 --> 00:07:54,785
<i>of that wonderful moment
in Streetcar Named Desire</i>

174
00:07:54,918 --> 00:07:57,918
when the brutish Stanley
says to the ultra-refined Blanche:

175
00:07:58,118 --> 00:08:01,251
"We've had this date with each other
from the beginning."

176
00:08:01,518 --> 00:08:02,585
I don't know the play well,

177
00:08:02,785 --> 00:08:04,851
but I can tell you right now,
I'm not that refined.

178
00:08:05,118 --> 00:08:07,585
Actually, I was picturing you
more as Stanley.

179
00:08:15,585 --> 00:08:17,985
- Hi there.
- Donny, so glad you could make it.

180
00:08:18,185 --> 00:08:19,251
Well, thanks for inviting me.

181
00:08:19,518 --> 00:08:21,651
This is a great place
to get some work done.

182
00:08:21,851 --> 00:08:23,585
And no distractions in sight.

183
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:26,851
- Thank...
- Donny, I'd like to introduce...

184
00:08:26,985 --> 00:08:30,118
Oh, that's right.
You two know each other, don't you?

185
00:08:30,585 --> 00:08:34,185
- Roz, how the hell are you? Hi.
- Donny.

186
00:08:34,318 --> 00:08:36,985
I didn't know you were gonna be here.
This is gonna be fun.

187
00:08:37,251 --> 00:08:38,918
I gotta put these somewhere.
Where do I go?

188
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:41,185
- Just in one of the bedrooms upstairs.
- Okay.

189
00:08:41,318 --> 00:08:45,518
But be careful not to wake Roz's baby.
She's in that first room.

190
00:08:46,585 --> 00:08:48,251
Roz, you've got a baby?

191
00:08:48,518 --> 00:08:51,185
Congratulations.
That means that you're...

192
00:08:51,451 --> 00:08:53,851
Married? Nope. She's free as a bird.

193
00:08:54,918 --> 00:08:57,651
Well, I'll try to be quiet.

194
00:08:59,918 --> 00:09:01,985
- What the hell is this?
- What do you mean?

195
00:09:02,185 --> 00:09:05,118
I thought you might enjoy reminiscing
about all the good times you shared.

196
00:09:05,251 --> 00:09:08,318
Oh, no, you don't.
Donny is seeing Daphne,

197
00:09:08,518 --> 00:09:12,318
and I am not the kind
who steals other people's boyfriends.

198
00:09:12,518 --> 00:09:16,585
Not friends' boyfriends,
not good friends. Not again.

199
00:09:17,585 --> 00:09:20,451
Roz, you might recall
you went out with him for six months.

200
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:22,118
She's only seen him
three or four times.

201
00:09:22,318 --> 00:09:25,585
- They're not even sleeping together.
- What? How would you know?

202
00:09:25,851 --> 00:09:27,251
She told me.

203
00:09:27,451 --> 00:09:30,318
I don't wanna be the bad guy here,
but you did have him first.

204
00:09:30,451 --> 00:09:32,585
And he did wanna make
a life with you.

205
00:09:33,451 --> 00:09:35,585
Listen, there is no way
that I am going...

206
00:09:35,785 --> 00:09:37,851
She hasn't slept with him?

207
00:09:38,585 --> 00:09:40,518
She's English.

208
00:09:42,451 --> 00:09:43,585
Why don't you just admit it?

209
00:09:43,785 --> 00:09:45,651
You're just doing this
because you want Daphne.

210
00:09:45,851 --> 00:09:49,985
Yes. Yes. Yes, I want Daphne.
I think we belong together,

211
00:09:50,118 --> 00:09:52,118
just like I think you and Donny
belong together.

212
00:09:52,185 --> 00:09:56,985
And why should two people be happy
when four people can be ecstatic?

213
00:09:59,185 --> 00:10:04,318
Well, you got a point there.
No. No, no, no, it's just not right.

214
00:10:04,518 --> 00:10:07,251
Roz, I swear I did not wake her.

215
00:10:07,451 --> 00:10:09,785
She was already up
when I went in to look at her.

216
00:10:09,851 --> 00:10:12,185
She's got such a sweet little face.

217
00:10:12,318 --> 00:10:14,918
- Her name is Alice.
- Hi, Alice, I'm Donny.

218
00:10:14,985 --> 00:10:17,251
She doesn't usually
let strangers hold her.

219
00:10:17,451 --> 00:10:20,518
I've always been pretty good with kids.
Come on, sweetie, come on.

220
00:10:20,785 --> 00:10:22,585
How's my hair?

221
00:10:28,785 --> 00:10:31,318
- Niles.
- Hey.

222
00:10:31,585 --> 00:10:33,318
Frasier, Dad.
What are you doing here today?

223
00:10:33,518 --> 00:10:36,251
Oh, my dentist is sick.
We had to reschedule.

224
00:10:36,518 --> 00:10:38,251
- Oh, no.
- It's just a head cold.

225
00:10:38,451 --> 00:10:40,318
Oh, God, you haven't
even heard the worst yet.

226
00:10:40,585 --> 00:10:42,651
Butcher shop was closed,
so here I am with my spices

227
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:44,851
and everything I need
to make my duck à I'orange,

228
00:10:44,985 --> 00:10:46,518
all I've got is the I'orange.

229
00:10:46,785 --> 00:10:48,851
We're gonna have to get ducks
the old-fashioned way,

230
00:10:49,118 --> 00:10:51,185
but there's only
a couple of hours of daylight left.

231
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:53,585
Yes. You know, I saw some boxes
of ammo in the mudroom.

232
00:10:53,851 --> 00:10:56,118
- Through the kitchen.
- No, Dad. Are you insane?

233
00:10:56,318 --> 00:10:58,785
I'm not gonna shoot any ducks.
It's barbaric.

234
00:10:58,985 --> 00:11:00,585
You'll eat them but you won't kill them.

235
00:11:00,851 --> 00:11:04,318
What do you think,
these things are born à I'orange?

236
00:11:05,985 --> 00:11:06,985
Dad does have a point.

237
00:11:07,185 --> 00:11:08,651
There is a duck blind
across the lake.

238
00:11:08,851 --> 00:11:10,918
It would be a good opportunity
for you two to bond.

239
00:11:11,118 --> 00:11:13,651
- Niles, what about you?
- I will stay here and season the pans.

240
00:11:13,851 --> 00:11:16,318
- I'm not going hunting.
- Then drive back to Seattle,

241
00:11:16,518 --> 00:11:18,651
find another shop that's open,
and come back tomorrow.

242
00:11:18,851 --> 00:11:20,651
What's going on?
You trying to get rid of us?

243
00:11:20,851 --> 00:11:24,251
- That's preposterous. Why should l...?
- Frasier, Martin.

244
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:26,585
You weren't supposed to be here
until tomorrow.

245
00:11:26,851 --> 00:11:29,451
- Roz, what are you doing here?
- Niles brought me.

246
00:11:29,651 --> 00:11:32,585
I'm just gonna go
heat up a bottle for Alice.

247
00:11:39,451 --> 00:11:41,651
- Roz?
- Roz.

248
00:11:43,518 --> 00:11:45,451
Roz.

249
00:11:45,518 --> 00:11:49,318
Yes, so why don't you two run along
and leave me alone with Roz?

250
00:11:49,451 --> 00:11:50,585
Roz?

251
00:11:50,651 --> 00:11:53,185
Well, didn't you urge me
to make a fresh start?

252
00:11:53,451 --> 00:11:54,585
True, but I gotta tell you,

253
00:11:54,785 --> 00:11:57,118
Roz isn't the freshest start
you could make.

254
00:11:57,251 --> 00:12:00,518
Now, butt out, Frasier. If these two
wanna be alone together, that's fine.

255
00:12:00,651 --> 00:12:03,318
- Now, we're gonna go hunting.
- I'm not going hunting, Dad.

256
00:12:03,518 --> 00:12:07,185
Roz and Niles? Please,
you guys have nothing in common.

257
00:12:07,451 --> 00:12:08,785
Frasier, we're not getting married.

258
00:12:08,985 --> 00:12:10,918
We're going to spend
an afternoon together.

259
00:12:11,118 --> 00:12:13,451
There's nothing wrong
with trying something different.

260
00:12:13,518 --> 00:12:16,851
Which is what you're gonna do now.
So come on, let's go get some ducks.

261
00:12:16,985 --> 00:12:19,251
- Dad...
- Please, take as long as you need.

262
00:12:19,451 --> 00:12:21,918
- I don't wanna go hunting.
- Oh, come on.

263
00:12:21,985 --> 00:12:24,918
Didn't you ever hear the expression
"two's company, three's a crowd"?

264
00:12:24,985 --> 00:12:28,985
No, Dad, I don't think I ever did.
How does it go?

265
00:12:29,651 --> 00:12:31,451
I left some papers in the car.

266
00:12:31,585 --> 00:12:32,918
- Where'd you park?
- Out back.

267
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:34,651
Then it's best to go
through the kitchen

268
00:12:34,851 --> 00:12:36,518
because we have
a loose plank on the porch.

269
00:12:36,785 --> 00:12:37,851
I already came in that way.

270
00:12:37,985 --> 00:12:40,251
Well, you cheated death once.
Don't push your luck.

271
00:12:41,118 --> 00:12:43,118
Niles, one last warning.

272
00:12:43,318 --> 00:12:44,851
Take it from someone
who knows you both.

273
00:12:44,985 --> 00:12:46,518
You and Roz are not a good couple.

274
00:12:46,651 --> 00:12:48,518
I understand your saying that,
but believe me,

275
00:12:48,651 --> 00:12:50,985
I have seen a new Roz
and underneath that brazen exterior,

276
00:12:51,251 --> 00:12:53,518
she is a sweet, sensitive, shy,
vulnerable woman.

277
00:12:53,651 --> 00:12:57,518
Niles? Have you seen my nipples?

278
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,585
No.

279
00:13:11,651 --> 00:13:14,851
- Niles and Roz? It's just ridiculous.
- Oh, not this again.

280
00:13:14,918 --> 00:13:18,118
Well, they are just
completely incompatible.

281
00:13:18,251 --> 00:13:20,518
Well, haven't you ever heard
about opposites attracting?

282
00:13:20,651 --> 00:13:22,851
I mean, look at your mother and me.

283
00:13:22,918 --> 00:13:25,185
We went together six months,
nobody thought it'd last.

284
00:13:25,318 --> 00:13:27,451
We had 40 happy years together.

285
00:13:29,318 --> 00:13:31,318
- Never thought of it that way.
- Yeah.

286
00:13:31,585 --> 00:13:33,251
And then,
there are those relationships

287
00:13:33,451 --> 00:13:35,251
where people have
a ton of things in common,

288
00:13:35,318 --> 00:13:38,118
and of course,
they always work out real well.

289
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:42,118
I suppose that was a backhanded
comment about me and Lilith.

290
00:13:42,251 --> 00:13:46,851
Wouldn't it be great if she was flying
by here on her broomstick right now?

291
00:13:47,985 --> 00:13:49,518
- Come on, sight up.
- No.

292
00:13:49,651 --> 00:13:51,318
No, I told you,
I'm not shooting anything.

293
00:13:51,518 --> 00:13:54,918
- All right, blow the duck call.
- Well, all right.

294
00:14:00,185 --> 00:14:03,251
Gee, you know,
I keep thinking about you and Mom.

295
00:14:03,518 --> 00:14:05,185
Maybe Niles and Roz
do have a chance.

296
00:14:05,451 --> 00:14:07,451
Well, sure they do. Blow it again.

297
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:17,118
You know, I hope I didn't discourage
Niles too much by the way I reacted.

298
00:14:17,185 --> 00:14:19,451
You know how much stock
he puts in my opinion.

299
00:14:19,585 --> 00:14:21,451
Blow it, Frasier.

300
00:14:22,518 --> 00:14:24,851
I didn't mean the duck call.

301
00:14:28,585 --> 00:14:31,651
What about that time in Cancún
when the car breaks down

302
00:14:31,851 --> 00:14:33,518
and that guy gives us a ride
on his donkey.

303
00:14:33,785 --> 00:14:35,585
Niles, you have to hear this.

304
00:14:35,785 --> 00:14:37,851
Oh, God, I didn't realise
it'd gotten so late.

305
00:14:38,118 --> 00:14:41,785
I have to fax these contracts
to the office right away.

306
00:14:41,918 --> 00:14:43,451
You wouldn't happen
to have a machine?

307
00:14:43,651 --> 00:14:45,518
There's one in the study
right down that hall.

308
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:49,318
But can't that wait?
We're all getting so mellow here.

309
00:14:49,985 --> 00:14:52,451
You're right. It can wait.
You know what we need?

310
00:14:52,585 --> 00:14:54,785
Another bottle of wine
and I brought one. I'll get it.

311
00:14:54,918 --> 00:14:56,985
Excellent, excellent.

312
00:14:58,585 --> 00:15:00,851
- Well, it's going well, don't you think?
- Yeah.

313
00:15:00,985 --> 00:15:03,118
Except your dad and Frasier
will be here any minute.

314
00:15:03,318 --> 00:15:05,918
And if either one of them
sees Donny, things are over.

315
00:15:06,118 --> 00:15:09,251
They're not gonna. You're gonna invite
him to watch the sunset by the lake.

316
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:11,251
You're gonna work
your charms on him,

317
00:15:11,451 --> 00:15:13,318
then you're going to invite him
out to dinner,

318
00:15:13,518 --> 00:15:14,851
and who knows where that'll lead.

319
00:15:14,985 --> 00:15:17,118
What am I saying?
We both know where that'll lead.

320
00:15:17,651 --> 00:15:19,785
- You really think it'll work?
- Yes, yes, yes.

321
00:15:19,918 --> 00:15:21,785
You go there,
you enjoy that romantic sunset.

322
00:15:21,918 --> 00:15:23,251
- I'll stay with the baby.
- Okay.

323
00:15:23,451 --> 00:15:25,585
Oh, for heaven's sake.

324
00:15:25,785 --> 00:15:28,251
You're not gonna let her
go and enjoy the sunset by herself?

325
00:15:28,451 --> 00:15:30,185
Frasier, what are you doing back
so soon?

326
00:15:30,451 --> 00:15:33,451
I came back for some more ammo.
Who knew ducks were so shifty?

327
00:15:34,251 --> 00:15:36,585
Anyway, listen.

328
00:15:36,985 --> 00:15:39,518
I know that you took
my advice to heart,

329
00:15:39,651 --> 00:15:41,918
but I tell you, I've changed my mind.

330
00:15:42,185 --> 00:15:43,851
I now approve of you and Roz.

331
00:15:44,518 --> 00:15:47,118
- What?
- Yes, the two of you should go for it.

332
00:15:47,251 --> 00:15:48,985
Okay, come on.
Off you two go, let's go.

333
00:15:49,251 --> 00:15:51,118
- I don't think this is a good idea.
- Why not?

334
00:15:51,251 --> 00:15:52,918
I've changed my mind.
I'd rather stay here.

335
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:54,251
What? You know what?

336
00:15:54,518 --> 00:15:56,985
You guys are putting
far too much stock in my opinion.

337
00:15:57,185 --> 00:16:00,251
Come on, let's get down to the lake
and enjoy that sunset.

338
00:16:00,451 --> 00:16:01,651
- But l...
- Let's go.

339
00:16:01,785 --> 00:16:04,518
No, not another word.
Down to the lake.

340
00:16:05,118 --> 00:16:07,851
Okay. I've got a...

341
00:16:11,851 --> 00:16:13,318
Alice.

342
00:16:13,451 --> 00:16:15,518
It's okay, honey.

343
00:16:31,318 --> 00:16:33,518
You wait here. I'll get Donny.

344
00:16:34,851 --> 00:16:38,651
You know, Roz is heading down
to the lake to catch that sunset.

345
00:16:38,851 --> 00:16:40,785
And you should be going
with her too.

346
00:16:40,918 --> 00:16:42,518
For God's sakes,
I told the two of you,

347
00:16:42,651 --> 00:16:44,918
I withdraw my objection.
Now, come on, let's go.

348
00:16:45,118 --> 00:16:46,651
I'm worried
about leaving Alice alone.

349
00:16:46,918 --> 00:16:48,851
Now, Roz, listen,
I will attend to the baby.

350
00:16:48,985 --> 00:16:50,585
I was about to make myself
a cup of tea.

351
00:16:50,851 --> 00:16:53,185
Now, come on, let's go.
March. Both of you, out the door.

352
00:16:53,451 --> 00:16:54,785
You'll enjoy that romantic sunset

353
00:16:54,985 --> 00:16:57,185
if I have to drag you
down there myself.

354
00:17:04,185 --> 00:17:06,185
Oh, okay.

355
00:17:17,185 --> 00:17:20,318
Good lord,
I just can't believe the two of them.

356
00:17:20,518 --> 00:17:24,185
Ridiculous behaviour. My God.

357
00:17:25,918 --> 00:17:27,585
- Daphne!
- Sorry.

358
00:17:27,785 --> 00:17:30,185
- Did I startle you?
- No, no, no, that's quite all right.

359
00:17:30,318 --> 00:17:33,851
It's just that if Niles knew
you were here, he would never...

360
00:17:34,518 --> 00:17:37,785
Well, forgive himself
for not being here to greet you.

361
00:17:37,918 --> 00:17:39,451
He wasn't expecting me.

362
00:17:39,518 --> 00:17:42,585
Me plans changed and I thought
I'd drive up and join you all.

363
00:17:42,785 --> 00:17:45,518
Well, isn't that nice?
You've got to leave.

364
00:17:45,651 --> 00:17:47,451
- Why?
- No, well, you see,

365
00:17:47,985 --> 00:17:51,318
Niles is up here for what a...
I think you Brits call

366
00:17:51,585 --> 00:17:54,185
a dirty weekend with someone.

367
00:17:54,251 --> 00:17:57,251
And the someone
happens to be Roz.

368
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:58,985
Roz?

369
00:17:59,185 --> 00:18:00,785
You mean, "Roz" Roz.

370
00:18:00,985 --> 00:18:02,985
Yes, yes.
You've gotta get out of here.

371
00:18:03,251 --> 00:18:05,918
But I just drove two hours
and it's getting dark outside.

372
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:07,318
All right, I'll tell you what.

373
00:18:07,518 --> 00:18:09,185
There's a bed-and-breakfast
up the road.

374
00:18:09,318 --> 00:18:11,518
I think Dad, you and I
should stay there this evening.

375
00:18:11,585 --> 00:18:12,851
- All right.
- Great.

376
00:18:12,985 --> 00:18:16,785
- Could I use the bathroom first?
- No, no, of course. Right in there.

377
00:18:19,251 --> 00:18:21,185
Dear God.

378
00:18:24,518 --> 00:18:25,585
Where's Donny?

379
00:18:25,785 --> 00:18:27,851
He can't be in the kitchen.
Frasier would've seen him.

380
00:18:28,118 --> 00:18:30,185
Look, the door. He must be up there.

381
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:32,785
- You keep a look out. I'll go get him.
- Okay.

382
00:18:35,451 --> 00:18:38,118
Why don't I take over here
and you can join Roz?

383
00:18:39,185 --> 00:18:42,585
For the love of God.

384
00:18:42,785 --> 00:18:44,651
If I'd known you
would take my words seriously,

385
00:18:44,851 --> 00:18:46,451
I would've chosen them
more carefully.

386
00:18:46,585 --> 00:18:49,985
For God's sakes, get out of here.
Get down to that lake.

387
00:18:50,185 --> 00:18:52,185
Fellas, I really think
I should check on Alice.

388
00:18:52,318 --> 00:18:54,918
No, no, Roz, your baby is just fine.

389
00:18:55,118 --> 00:18:57,451
I burped her once
and she went out like a light.

390
00:18:57,585 --> 00:18:58,785
Come on. Let's go, Niles.

391
00:18:58,985 --> 00:19:00,851
Oh, you know,
I am thinking about it.

392
00:19:01,118 --> 00:19:04,785
I think it's much more romantic
to stay here by the fire

393
00:19:04,918 --> 00:19:05,985
than watch some sunset.

394
00:19:06,185 --> 00:19:09,118
Why don't you clear out
so we can have our privacy?

395
00:19:09,785 --> 00:19:12,851
Well, all right.

396
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,318
On the other hand...

397
00:19:17,585 --> 00:19:19,985
You know, you can enjoy the fire
all night long.

398
00:19:20,251 --> 00:19:22,118
You've only got ten more minutes
for the sunset.

399
00:19:22,318 --> 00:19:23,851
You gonna get ammo
while it's daylight?

400
00:19:23,985 --> 00:19:27,185
- It's almost sunset.
- Don't tell me, tell them.

401
00:19:27,318 --> 00:19:28,651
- Is that the bathroom?
- No.

402
00:19:28,851 --> 00:19:30,985
- Yes, it is.
- It's out of order.

403
00:19:33,318 --> 00:19:35,185
Let me check again.

404
00:19:38,318 --> 00:19:41,651
My God. One of the pipes has burst
and the other one's knocking.

405
00:19:43,518 --> 00:19:45,651
Fine, is there one
down the hallway there?

406
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,251
- No.
- Yes, there is.

407
00:19:47,451 --> 00:19:48,518
No, it's out of order too.

408
00:19:48,651 --> 00:19:51,651
Well, it's a good thing
I brought all that beer.

409
00:19:52,918 --> 00:19:55,318
You know, Niles,
you're behaving awfully strangely.

410
00:19:55,585 --> 00:19:57,518
- What the heck is going on?
- What do you mean?

411
00:19:57,651 --> 00:20:00,785
I mean that you show absolutely
no desire to be alone with Roz.

412
00:20:00,918 --> 00:20:03,785
Starting to have serious doubts
about this so-called romance.

413
00:20:03,985 --> 00:20:05,585
Oh, really?

414
00:20:05,785 --> 00:20:08,985
Well, does this look "so-called" to you?
Come here, pookie.

415
00:20:17,651 --> 00:20:21,251
That's why the door was stuck.
You two, why didn't you tell me?

416
00:20:21,518 --> 00:20:23,318
- Donny.
- Donny?

417
00:20:23,585 --> 00:20:25,118
Daphne.

418
00:20:26,118 --> 00:20:28,585
- Daphne.
- What are you doing here?

419
00:20:28,851 --> 00:20:30,651
Well, Niles invited me.

420
00:20:30,918 --> 00:20:32,251
Oh, did he?

421
00:20:32,318 --> 00:20:34,918
It was nice. Roz and I
had a chance to catch up on old times.

422
00:20:35,118 --> 00:20:37,251
Yeah, that's right.
You two used to date, didn't you?

423
00:20:37,518 --> 00:20:41,651
Well, isn't that nice of Niles
to organise this little reunion?

424
00:20:41,985 --> 00:20:43,651
I hope I don't have anything
to worry about.

425
00:20:43,851 --> 00:20:45,451
Oh, come on, are you kidding?

426
00:20:45,651 --> 00:20:48,851
Well, obviously, Roz and Niles can
barely keep their hands off each other.

427
00:20:50,318 --> 00:20:52,851
You know,
why don't all of us get out of here?

428
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:56,651
Give these two little kids
a little privacy.

429
00:20:56,851 --> 00:20:59,918
You know, we could use
some privacy of our own.

430
00:21:00,118 --> 00:21:01,918
Dr. Crane tells me
there's a bed-and-breakfast

431
00:21:02,185 --> 00:21:04,251
up the road from here.

432
00:21:04,785 --> 00:21:07,785
- Really?
- Really.

433
00:21:11,118 --> 00:21:15,785
- Even more fun if we both go.
- Yes, yes. Bye.

434
00:21:15,918 --> 00:21:18,918
Well, come on, Frasier.
Let's go get a nice sloppy joe.

435
00:21:19,118 --> 00:21:20,785
I'll pay for it.

436
00:21:20,985 --> 00:21:23,851
Something tells me I'll pay for it too.

437
00:21:26,851 --> 00:21:29,985
I realise now
that you two don't need my blessing

438
00:21:30,185 --> 00:21:33,118
so I'll just leave you with this:
