1
00:00:10,484 --> 00:00:12,945
Frasier, was that the author
Dr. Gordon Edelstein?

2
00:00:13,153 --> 00:00:14,780
- Yes.
- I wasn't aware that you knew him.

3
00:00:14,989 --> 00:00:17,866
We just met. You see, the station
is hiring another call-in psychiatrist

4
00:00:18,075 --> 00:00:19,243
for a one-week trial period.

5
00:00:19,451 --> 00:00:21,412
They've asked me
to choose among the finalists.

6
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:23,622
Well, he'd be wonderful.

7
00:00:23,831 --> 00:00:29,211
I just finished his book on the victims
of obsessive-compulsive disorder.

8
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:33,006
Poor tic-ridden devils.

9
00:00:33,215 --> 00:00:36,969
Niles, before you take out your
utensil chamois, I've got to tell you,

10
00:00:38,345 --> 00:00:40,472
I've got another interview
in just a few minutes,

11
00:00:40,681 --> 00:00:42,683
though it's gonna be hard
to top Dr. Edelstein.

12
00:00:42,891 --> 00:00:46,186
- I'd say you're taking this rather well.
- What do you mean?

13
00:00:46,395 --> 00:00:50,232
Many people in your position would
feel threatened at the thought of,

14
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:53,110
well, another cat
sharing the litter box.

15
00:00:54,987 --> 00:00:57,948
Your flattering analogy aside, Niles,
I take it as a tribute.

16
00:00:58,156 --> 00:01:00,492
Obviously, the station
is so pleased with my show

17
00:01:00,701 --> 00:01:02,244
they're looking
for more of the same.

18
00:01:02,411 --> 00:01:04,538
They can hardly ask me
to do another three hours.

19
00:01:04,746 --> 00:01:06,581
You can imagine
how exhausting that would be.

20
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:08,750
And for you as well.

21
00:01:11,503 --> 00:01:15,340
Anyway, moving on to me,
what's the verdict?

22
00:01:15,841 --> 00:01:18,760
- Verdict?
- On my new look.

23
00:01:18,969 --> 00:01:21,805
- I say you deserve some of the credit.
- Really?

24
00:01:22,013 --> 00:01:24,933
Yes, you keep saying I should accept
Daphne's relationship with Donny

25
00:01:25,141 --> 00:01:27,811
and find a paramour of my own.
Well, the hunt is on.

26
00:01:27,978 --> 00:01:33,858
I thought to bolster my self-esteem,
I would adopt this raffish new look.

27
00:01:34,442 --> 00:01:37,445
Well, it suits you.

28
00:01:37,904 --> 00:01:41,074
Dashing and yet understated and...

29
00:01:41,282 --> 00:01:44,119
Oh, I give up.
What are we talking about?

30
00:01:44,661 --> 00:01:46,788
My moustache.

31
00:01:50,291 --> 00:01:51,835
I grant you, it's at an early stage.

32
00:01:52,043 --> 00:01:54,420
What stage?
Research and development?

33
00:01:55,296 --> 00:01:59,050
- Dr. Crane. Dr. Nora Fairchild.
- Oh, yes, of course. Welcome.

34
00:01:59,259 --> 00:02:01,302
I can't tell you
what a privilege this is.

35
00:02:01,511 --> 00:02:04,263
I listened to your show today
and I was amazed.

36
00:02:04,472 --> 00:02:05,473
Well...

37
00:02:05,682 --> 00:02:07,642
I hope that doesn't sound
too fawning.

38
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:10,269
Fawning is just fine. Fawning is fun.

39
00:02:10,478 --> 00:02:12,397
I hope I'm not interrupting
another interview.

40
00:02:12,605 --> 00:02:15,274
No, no, this is my brother, Niles Crane.
He's just about to leave.

41
00:02:15,441 --> 00:02:17,068
I should have known
you two were brothers.

42
00:02:17,276 --> 00:02:19,612
The same superb fashion sense,

43
00:02:19,821 --> 00:02:23,074
the same refined
yet masculine good looks.

44
00:02:23,282 --> 00:02:27,161
You must be so proud
of your kid brother, the radio star.

45
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:29,038
Well, yes.

46
00:02:29,247 --> 00:02:33,334
Congratulations on your new job.
I hope you'll be very happy at KACL.

47
00:02:34,085 --> 00:02:35,419
Isn't that a bit premature?

48
00:02:35,628 --> 00:02:37,964
Oh, well, let's just say
I know my little brother.

49
00:02:44,095 --> 00:02:48,015
- Well, here's where it all happens.
- Dr. Nora, welcome. Please come in.

50
00:02:48,224 --> 00:02:50,226
I see you've already met
our crack station manager.

51
00:02:50,434 --> 00:02:51,560
Yes. I wanna thank you both

52
00:02:51,769 --> 00:02:53,437
for making me
and my producer feel welcome.

53
00:02:53,646 --> 00:02:55,731
Is everyone around here
as friendly as you two?

54
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:58,609
- Well...
- Well, hello there.

55
00:02:59,318 --> 00:03:01,612
Some are even friendlier.

56
00:03:01,821 --> 00:03:04,156
This is my producer, Roz Doyle.

57
00:03:04,365 --> 00:03:06,325
Dr. Nora.
And this is my producer, George.

58
00:03:06,534 --> 00:03:08,369
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

59
00:03:08,577 --> 00:03:11,372
Follow me
and I'll give you the lay of the land.

60
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:18,087
Let's just hope that's a figure
of speech and not a sales pitch.

61
00:03:19,338 --> 00:03:22,341
Well, Nora, please, please,
do come in. Make yourself at home.

62
00:03:22,549 --> 00:03:26,512
Here we are. Get settled in.
Here's your headset.

63
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,014
Of course, the phone lines.
Everything's self-explanatory.

64
00:03:29,223 --> 00:03:31,058
Cough button, on-air button.

65
00:03:31,266 --> 00:03:35,312
Listen, I want you to remember,
it's all right to be nervous.

66
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:38,565
Even my first show
was a tad bumpy.

67
00:03:38,774 --> 00:03:40,359
Bumpy?

68
00:03:41,568 --> 00:03:45,280
It was a train wreck.
Medic, we got incoming.

69
00:03:45,489 --> 00:03:47,366
Thank you, Kenny.
You weren't even here then.

70
00:03:47,574 --> 00:03:49,201
I got a tape of it
from my Secret Santa.

71
00:03:50,744 --> 00:03:52,204
- Break a leg, Dr. Nora.
- Thank you.

72
00:03:52,412 --> 00:03:53,664
I'll get out of your hair.

73
00:03:53,872 --> 00:03:56,625
Godspeed, Dr. Nora.

74
00:04:01,421 --> 00:04:02,631
What are you smirking about?

75
00:04:02,839 --> 00:04:05,175
Oh, gosh, it's just so much fun
to have a protégé.

76
00:04:05,384 --> 00:04:07,052
Do you see the way
she behaves towards me?

77
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:12,599
It's like a shy Japanese novice
bowing before her Frasier sensei.

78
00:04:13,266 --> 00:04:15,936
I feel a bow coming on myself.
Could you pass me that wastebasket?

79
00:04:16,144 --> 00:04:18,271
Stop it. All right, she's about to start.

80
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,773
I just wanna catch the beginning,

81
00:04:19,981 --> 00:04:23,360
make sure she's got those
first-show jitters under control.

82
00:04:23,568 --> 00:04:25,654
Let's get right to our first caller.
Who do we have?

83
00:04:25,862 --> 00:04:27,906
We have Jenny from Tacoma
on line one.

84
00:04:28,114 --> 00:04:30,659
Hello, Jenny.
I'm Dr. Nora and I'm here to help.

85
00:04:30,867 --> 00:04:32,494
<i>Hi, Dr. Nora.</i>

86
00:04:32,702 --> 00:04:35,372
<i>My boyfriend and I have been
living together for about two years.</i>

87
00:04:35,538 --> 00:04:36,748
Are you having sex?

88
00:04:36,956 --> 00:04:39,793
<i>Our sex life's not the problem.
It's great.</i>

89
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:42,879
<i>But whenever I mention marriage,
he changes the subject.</i>

90
00:04:43,088 --> 00:04:44,798
<i>Do you think
that he's afraid of commitment?</i>

91
00:04:45,006 --> 00:04:46,091
No, that's not it.

92
00:04:46,299 --> 00:04:48,635
Let me help you see this
from a different perspective.

93
00:04:48,843 --> 00:04:50,845
You're a whore, Jenny.

94
00:04:56,559 --> 00:04:58,520
You're sleeping with a man
you're not married to.

95
00:04:58,728 --> 00:04:59,771
In my book, that's a whore.

96
00:04:59,979 --> 00:05:02,941
<i>Well, I'm not a whore.
I'm a flight attendant.</i>

97
00:05:03,149 --> 00:05:05,276
Oh, you think there's no overlap?

98
00:05:08,154 --> 00:05:10,907
Well, she's got her jitters
under control.

99
00:05:11,074 --> 00:05:13,743
Wake up, Jenny, you've blown it.
Dump this creep.

100
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:15,995
Find a new guy,
and until you're Mrs. New Guy,

101
00:05:16,204 --> 00:05:18,998
you keep those knees together, okay?
Staple them.

102
00:05:21,167 --> 00:05:23,252
I don't care
if you have to hop to the altar.

103
00:05:23,836 --> 00:05:26,589
God bless, honey. Who's next?

104
00:05:28,466 --> 00:05:30,843
- Hello, Daphne.
- Hello.

105
00:05:35,431 --> 00:05:37,266
Notice anything?

106
00:05:38,684 --> 00:05:41,854
Oh, yes. Don't you look dashing.

107
00:05:42,063 --> 00:05:43,689
Blue really is your colour.

108
00:05:45,274 --> 00:05:47,860
Hold still, though,
there's something on your lip.

109
00:05:52,531 --> 00:05:55,451
Oh, wait, it's some sort of hair.

110
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:00,372
Actually, it's a moustache.

111
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:05,753
Oh, yes, so it is.
Still a bit on the wispy side.

112
00:06:06,045 --> 00:06:09,340
Yeah, it puts me in mind
of me Grammy Moon.

113
00:06:10,174 --> 00:06:13,594
Or rather, it will do,
once it's grown in a bit.

114
00:06:16,096 --> 00:06:18,432
- Turn on the radio.
- Is something the matter?

115
00:06:18,641 --> 00:06:20,434
Just turn the radio on
to KACL, please.

116
00:06:21,143 --> 00:06:24,021
<i>Listen to me. You have a child.</i>

117
00:06:24,229 --> 00:06:25,939
<i>You think you have the right
to get divorced</i>

118
00:06:26,148 --> 00:06:27,858
<i>just because you're tired
of your husband?</i>

119
00:06:28,067 --> 00:06:29,568
<i>But he's gay.</i>

120
00:06:30,069 --> 00:06:33,030
<i>You picked him.
You made a baby with him.</i>

121
00:06:33,238 --> 00:06:34,239
<i>Maybe you got him drunk,</i>

122
00:06:34,448 --> 00:06:36,617
<i>maybe you dressed up
as Antonio Banderas, I don't care.</i>

123
00:06:36,825 --> 00:06:39,119
<i>Just make it work.</i>

124
00:06:39,328 --> 00:06:41,163
Well, that's a bit harsh.

125
00:06:41,371 --> 00:06:44,333
Please, this is a woman
who believes the Spanish Inquisition

126
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:47,544
was just tough love for heretics.

127
00:06:49,129 --> 00:06:51,506
We were listening to her
while I was doing my exercises,

128
00:06:51,715 --> 00:06:53,884
- and I don't think she's so bad.
- Excuse me?

129
00:06:54,092 --> 00:06:57,387
Well, it's nice to have someone
stand up for old-fashioned values.

130
00:06:57,596 --> 00:07:00,724
Like sex. I mean, I'm no prude,
but in my day,

131
00:07:00,933 --> 00:07:04,353
sex was still something sacred
and mysterious.

132
00:07:04,561 --> 00:07:06,438
Nowadays, you can't even
turn on the television

133
00:07:06,647 --> 00:07:10,108
without hearing all this... stuff.

134
00:07:10,317 --> 00:07:14,446
Well, I think that explains
our 90-dollar cable bill this month.

135
00:07:20,786 --> 00:07:24,539
I liked her too.
She reminds me of my old mum.

136
00:07:24,748 --> 00:07:27,417
She'll point out
every little flaw you've got,

137
00:07:27,626 --> 00:07:30,462
remind you of every mistake
you ever made.

138
00:07:30,629 --> 00:07:32,756
Tell you you're lazy,
you'll never amount to anything

139
00:07:32,964 --> 00:07:34,925
and no good man will ever have you.

140
00:07:35,133 --> 00:07:38,678
But it's just because she loves you.

141
00:07:39,262 --> 00:07:42,307
In fact,
I think I'll give old Mum a call.

142
00:07:42,766 --> 00:07:45,060
You know, if you hate her so much,
why did you hire her?

143
00:07:45,268 --> 00:07:48,313
Well, I didn't know
she was going to behave this way.

144
00:07:48,521 --> 00:07:50,690
She said all the right things
at the interview.

145
00:07:50,899 --> 00:07:53,234
She certainly did.

146
00:07:53,443 --> 00:07:56,863
She complimented his clothes,
his looks,

147
00:07:57,071 --> 00:08:00,825
she even pretended to think
I was the older brother.

148
00:08:01,242 --> 00:08:04,579
Of course, the moustache may have
clouded her judgement on that.

149
00:08:09,542 --> 00:08:12,003
She has a moustache?

150
00:08:15,131 --> 00:08:19,260
Well, like it or not,
I am responsible for her being here.

151
00:08:19,469 --> 00:08:22,305
I'll just have to have a talk with her,
tell her to soften her approach

152
00:08:22,513 --> 00:08:24,140
before she alienates
her entire audience.

153
00:08:24,349 --> 00:08:25,516
People can tell the difference

154
00:08:25,725 --> 00:08:28,644
between constructive criticism
and outright abuse.

155
00:08:28,853 --> 00:08:31,230
No, Mum, me boyfriend
hasn't dumped me

156
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:33,941
for someone prettier
and smarter yet.

157
00:08:34,609 --> 00:08:37,111
She's such an old tease.

158
00:08:42,658 --> 00:08:45,494
Until tomorrow, then,
this is Dr. Frasier Crane.

159
00:08:49,165 --> 00:08:50,750
Dr. Nora.

160
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:53,711
Such a frosty tone.
Is something the matter?

161
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:56,255
I have just one question for you.

162
00:08:56,464 --> 00:08:58,758
What kind of vicious,
judgemental, name-calling,

163
00:08:58,966 --> 00:09:01,719
machete-mouthed bitch are you?

164
00:09:04,764 --> 00:09:07,141
I was going
for the less feisty version.

165
00:09:07,349 --> 00:09:09,477
I heard what you said
to that single mother yesterday.

166
00:09:09,685 --> 00:09:11,854
For your information,
I happen to be a single mom too.

167
00:09:12,062 --> 00:09:14,899
That doesn't surprise me, after
watching you pounce on poor George

168
00:09:15,107 --> 00:09:16,734
like a Kodiak bear on a salmon.

169
00:09:16,942 --> 00:09:18,694
- That does it!
- Roz, Roz, stop it.

170
00:09:18,903 --> 00:09:20,696
I've got to talk to Dr. Nora
before her show.

171
00:09:20,905 --> 00:09:23,032
Just pencil in
the hair-pulling for later, all right?

172
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,910
All right,
but this isn't over between us.

173
00:09:26,076 --> 00:09:28,746
If you want to,
I'll take this out on the street.

174
00:09:29,371 --> 00:09:32,166
That would hardly be fair.
You'd have the home-field advantage.

175
00:09:32,374 --> 00:09:35,836
Roz, Roz, Roz, get out. Out.

176
00:09:39,048 --> 00:09:41,467
Well, I don't even know
where to begin.

177
00:09:41,675 --> 00:09:43,927
Save it.
Whatever it is, I've already heard it.

178
00:09:44,136 --> 00:09:46,555
"Dr. Nora is mean.
Dr. Nora hurts people's feelings."

179
00:09:46,764 --> 00:09:48,307
Too bad.
I'm not here to coddle people.

180
00:09:48,515 --> 00:09:49,975
- I'm here to help them.
- Oh, really?

181
00:09:50,267 --> 00:09:52,936
And just how were you helping
that poor confused bisexual woman

182
00:09:53,145 --> 00:09:56,356
by calling her
an equal-opportunity slut?

183
00:09:57,691 --> 00:10:01,194
The worst thing about this is how you
misrepresented yourself to get this job.

184
00:10:01,403 --> 00:10:03,280
You're hardly one
to question my ethics.

185
00:10:03,488 --> 00:10:04,489
We both know you hired me

186
00:10:04,698 --> 00:10:06,742
because you hoped
I might sleep with you.

187
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:10,287
- That thought never occurred to me.
- Now who's lying?

188
00:10:10,495 --> 00:10:11,955
You won't admit that,
like most men,

189
00:10:12,122 --> 00:10:14,207
you leave all major decisions
to your penis.

190
00:10:16,043 --> 00:10:18,587
Fortunately for Seattle,
your penis chose right.

191
00:10:18,795 --> 00:10:20,380
It just didn't know why.

192
00:10:22,299 --> 00:10:24,426
Yes, well, you're just forgetting
one thing, Dr. Nora.

193
00:10:24,634 --> 00:10:27,596
You are here on my recommendation.
You may consider it withdrawn.

194
00:10:28,221 --> 00:10:30,432
- Hey, Dr. Crane.
- Kenny, just the man I wanted to see.

195
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,851
Dr. Nora. Don't hit me.

196
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,936
I wanna talk about Dr. Nora's show.

197
00:10:35,145 --> 00:10:36,980
Get in line.
The switchboard's been going nuts.

198
00:10:37,188 --> 00:10:39,107
- I don't doubt it.
- They love you.

199
00:10:39,316 --> 00:10:40,525
Excuse me?

200
00:10:40,734 --> 00:10:43,486
Except for the ones that hate you.
Either way, they're listening.

201
00:10:43,695 --> 00:10:45,322
So you consider that option
picked up.

202
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:47,115
- Ten seconds.
- Thank you, Kenny.

203
00:10:47,324 --> 00:10:49,159
Now get out of my booth.

204
00:10:49,743 --> 00:10:51,327
Yes, ma'am.

205
00:10:53,204 --> 00:10:54,789
Kenny.

206
00:10:54,998 --> 00:10:57,834
You can't be serious
about hiring that woman full-time.

207
00:10:58,042 --> 00:10:59,335
Putting that woman behind a mike

208
00:10:59,544 --> 00:11:01,588
is like putting Typhoid Mary
in a kissing booth.

209
00:11:01,796 --> 00:11:04,549
I'm sorry, doc. Ratings are ratings.

210
00:11:04,757 --> 00:11:06,134
<i>Hello, Dr. Nora.</i>

211
00:11:06,342 --> 00:11:08,887
<i>My name is Tom
and I have this co-worker</i>

212
00:11:09,095 --> 00:11:11,681
<i>who's really driving me up the wall.
What can I do about it?</i>

213
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:16,185
Not a thing, Tom.
Not one damn thing.

214
00:11:23,443 --> 00:11:25,486
<i>Nothing I ever do
is good enough for her.</i>

215
00:11:25,695 --> 00:11:29,657
<i>I baked a cake for her birthday
and she said it tasted like sawdust.</i>

216
00:11:30,324 --> 00:11:31,492
<i>I know she's my mother,</i>

217
00:11:31,701 --> 00:11:34,662
<i>but sometimes
I just wanna shut her out of my life.</i>

218
00:11:34,871 --> 00:11:37,957
Oh, Denise,
burning bridges solves nothing.

219
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:41,169
I'd like to suggest
that you seek family counselling

220
00:11:41,377 --> 00:11:43,796
to help you and your mother
get to the root of these issues,

221
00:11:44,005 --> 00:11:45,798
provided your mother
is willing to cooperate.

222
00:11:46,007 --> 00:11:48,134
If not, perhaps
individual counselling would help.

223
00:11:48,342 --> 00:11:50,678
Will you stay on the line
so Roz can give you some numbers?

224
00:11:50,887 --> 00:11:52,805
<i>Okay. Thank you, Dr. Crane.</i>

225
00:11:53,014 --> 00:11:54,724
It's my pleasure.

226
00:11:55,349 --> 00:11:59,979
Well, I see through the glass
that Dr. Nora either disagrees with me

227
00:12:00,187 --> 00:12:03,107
or has just eaten a bad clam.

228
00:12:07,028 --> 00:12:09,697
<i>I'm sure she'll tell us which
when the Dr. Nora Show begins,</i>

229
00:12:09,864 --> 00:12:13,117
right after this traffic report
from Chopper Dave.

230
00:12:16,245 --> 00:12:17,913
Okay, Denise,
I've got the numbers for you.

231
00:12:18,122 --> 00:12:20,082
- Do you have a pencil?
- Come on, Roz, hurry up.

232
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:22,293
I wanna get out of here
before her trainer shows up

233
00:12:22,501 --> 00:12:25,462
with a bucket of live mice
for her pre-show feeding.

234
00:12:26,255 --> 00:12:29,466
I'm sorry to cut you off, Chopper Dave,
but we have a therapy emergency.

235
00:12:29,675 --> 00:12:31,510
<i>- Denise, are you still on?
- Yes.</i>

236
00:12:31,719 --> 00:12:33,178
- That's my caller.
- Denise.

237
00:12:33,345 --> 00:12:36,181
I want you to ignore everything
Dr. Crane just told you.

238
00:12:36,348 --> 00:12:37,933
I know more about mothers
than he does.

239
00:12:38,142 --> 00:12:40,978
And here is fact number one:
They don't change.

240
00:12:41,186 --> 00:12:42,521
Cut this woman out of your life.

241
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:45,315
<i>- I don't believe this.
- You don't think that with counsel...?</i>

242
00:12:45,524 --> 00:12:47,025
When you have a tumour,
what do you do?

243
00:12:47,234 --> 00:12:51,196
Do you sit it down and say,
"Hey, tumour, let's get along, okay?"

244
00:12:51,405 --> 00:12:56,452
No, you take a knife and you cut it out.
Well, Denise, your mother is a tumour.

245
00:12:57,578 --> 00:13:00,497
My heart bleeds for you,
because I have been there.

246
00:13:00,706 --> 00:13:03,083
I know how hard it is to look
at your mother's face and say:

247
00:13:03,292 --> 00:13:07,629
"Bye-bye, you toxic harpy.
You're not hurting me again."

248
00:13:07,838 --> 00:13:09,214
But that is what you have to do.

249
00:13:09,423 --> 00:13:10,966
<i>I think maybe you're right.</i>

250
00:13:11,174 --> 00:13:12,342
I'm always right.

251
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:14,553
And you know what else?

252
00:13:14,761 --> 00:13:19,016
I bet your cake was yummy.
God bless, honey.

253
00:13:19,474 --> 00:13:22,728
- Who's next?
- We have Frasier from here.

254
00:13:27,232 --> 00:13:29,734
How dare you ambush Denise
that way?

255
00:13:29,943 --> 00:13:30,986
Well, what a surprise.

256
00:13:31,194 --> 00:13:33,613
I dare to give one of Frasier's callers
a second opinion,

257
00:13:33,822 --> 00:13:34,906
and what does Frasier say?

258
00:13:38,952 --> 00:13:41,788
Yes, sound effects,
the therapist's best friend.

259
00:13:41,955 --> 00:13:43,957
You realize what you're doing
is unprofessional.

260
00:13:44,165 --> 00:13:46,418
Denise called my show.
She didn't ask for your opinion.

261
00:13:46,626 --> 00:13:49,671
And I didn't ask for yours.
Back to you, Chopper Dave.

262
00:13:50,297 --> 00:13:52,340
She just cut me off.

263
00:13:52,841 --> 00:13:54,175
All right, let's just settle this.

264
00:13:54,384 --> 00:13:56,886
We don't like each other,
but we're gonna have to coexist here.

265
00:13:57,095 --> 00:13:59,014
So why don't we agree
that I won't criticize you

266
00:13:59,222 --> 00:14:00,765
and you won't criticize me. Deal?

267
00:14:00,974 --> 00:14:02,350
- No.
- No?

268
00:14:02,517 --> 00:14:04,269
No, I will undermine you
every chance I get,

269
00:14:04,477 --> 00:14:06,563
because you, Dr. Crane,
are a dangerous man.

270
00:14:06,896 --> 00:14:08,731
- I'm dangerous?
- Yes.

271
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,692
Seattle's great enabler.

272
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:14,195
You tell tramps and fornicators
that their problem is low self-esteem.

273
00:14:14,404 --> 00:14:17,156
They should have low self-esteem.
They're going to hell.

274
00:14:20,577 --> 00:14:21,786
I take it back.

275
00:14:21,995 --> 00:14:24,080
You're not unprofessional,
you're a freaking loon.

276
00:14:24,539 --> 00:14:26,457
Five seconds.

277
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:29,836
All right, if it's war you two want,
it's war you'll get.

278
00:14:30,128 --> 00:14:31,587
Right, Roz?

279
00:14:31,796 --> 00:14:34,674
You don't actually buy
all this no-sex stuff of hers, do you?

280
00:14:34,882 --> 00:14:38,803
- Yeah.
- Well, it's war!

281
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:45,977
- Oh, hi, Niles.
- Hey, Dad.

282
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:49,522
As you've probably noticed,
I shaved my moustache.

283
00:14:54,193 --> 00:14:57,822
I decided a better way to change
my look was to pump some iron.

284
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:00,908
- So, what, you joined a gym?
- I certainly did.

285
00:15:01,409 --> 00:15:05,121
I start the minute my weight belt
gets back from the monogrammer's.

286
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,083
Frasier, you free for dinner?

287
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,876
Well, I suppose so, yes.

288
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:13,087
Hey, look who I bumped into
in the elevator.

289
00:15:13,295 --> 00:15:14,296
- Roz.
- Hey, Roz.

290
00:15:14,505 --> 00:15:17,174
I've been on the phone all day
digging up dirt on Dr. Nora,

291
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:19,844
- and you will not believe what I found.
- Really?

292
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:23,013
I called the station where she worked
and they couldn't wait to dish her.

293
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:24,765
For starters,
she has no medical degree.

294
00:15:24,974 --> 00:15:28,352
Her doctorate
is in Physical Education.

295
00:15:28,561 --> 00:15:32,398
She's a gym teacher.

296
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:35,859
Wouldn't wanna be the chubby kid
in that gym class.

297
00:15:36,569 --> 00:15:38,946
Or the boy
in the monogrammed weight belt.

298
00:15:42,324 --> 00:15:44,284
Well, this is just dynamite, Roz.

299
00:15:44,493 --> 00:15:46,996
Oh, that's not even half of it.
Her name isn't Fairchild.

300
00:15:47,204 --> 00:15:48,288
She was born Mulhern.

301
00:15:48,497 --> 00:15:51,667
And Little Miss Family-Values
has two divorces behind her

302
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:53,544
and an affair with a married man.

303
00:15:53,752 --> 00:15:56,338
Tomorrow, I am going to drop
this little bombshell

304
00:15:56,547 --> 00:15:58,632
to start my show and end hers.

305
00:15:58,841 --> 00:16:00,425
You know, Fras,
when I was on the force,

306
00:16:00,634 --> 00:16:02,761
I went through a feud like this
with Charlie Drucker,

307
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:04,304
and believe me, it's not worth it.

308
00:16:04,513 --> 00:16:06,765
I started out by making a joke
about his chest.

309
00:16:06,974 --> 00:16:07,975
- His chest?
- Yeah.

310
00:16:08,183 --> 00:16:13,897
He was, like, a heavyset guy and
he had those, you know, man bosoms.

311
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,401
So he heard about it
and he got mad at me

312
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:19,778
and he wrote something about me
on the men's room wall,

313
00:16:19,987 --> 00:16:22,364
and I should have just called it quits
right there and then,

314
00:16:22,572 --> 00:16:26,034
but his name being Drucker
brought out the poet in me.

315
00:16:26,827 --> 00:16:28,286
And it just got worse and worse,

316
00:16:28,495 --> 00:16:30,288
and we both ended up
looking like idiots.

317
00:16:30,497 --> 00:16:33,875
I don't intend to get into a feud with
her, I just wanna get her off the air.

318
00:16:34,084 --> 00:16:37,170
But if you attack her like that,
aren't you just descending to her level?

319
00:16:37,379 --> 00:16:38,755
You know, Roz, maybe they're right.

320
00:16:38,964 --> 00:16:41,007
Look at what this woman
has reduced me to already:

321
00:16:41,216 --> 00:16:45,512
Trading barbs, yelling over the air.
Now I'm spreading rumours about her.

322
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,431
Is that any way for a psychiatrist
to deal with conflict?

323
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,724
Don't you wimp out on me.

324
00:16:49,933 --> 00:16:52,310
Now, Roz, just think about it.
There may be a better way.

325
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:56,523
You know what, Dr. Nora is clearly
a damaged and angry woman.

326
00:16:56,731 --> 00:16:58,525
Maybe I could find out

327
00:16:58,733 --> 00:17:01,194
what's at the root of that anger
and help her,

328
00:17:01,403 --> 00:17:04,614
also proving that my method of therapy
is the more valid one.

329
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:08,243
Why are you doing this to me?
Look, if you have a tumour...

330
00:17:08,451 --> 00:17:10,245
Roz, stop it!

331
00:17:11,663 --> 00:17:14,666
If you wanna analyse her, you might
start with that whole mother thing.

332
00:17:14,874 --> 00:17:17,710
I caught her show yesterday.
That seemed to be a hot-button issue.

333
00:17:17,877 --> 00:17:20,255
Yes, it did, didn't it?
They've been estranged for years.

334
00:17:20,463 --> 00:17:21,965
Perhaps we could find the woman

335
00:17:22,173 --> 00:17:24,133
and discover
what caused this rift between them.

336
00:17:24,342 --> 00:17:27,804
- Maybe even effect a reconciliation.
- Of course, it won't be easy.

337
00:17:28,012 --> 00:17:30,056
We don't even know
if the woman's still alive.

338
00:17:30,265 --> 00:17:32,684
Yes, all sorts of things could happen
to a woman her age.

339
00:17:32,892 --> 00:17:34,936
Her mother could've had
a heart attack or a stroke.

340
00:17:35,144 --> 00:17:36,187
Exactly.

341
00:17:36,396 --> 00:17:39,440
She could be hit by a bus
as she's coming out of the pub,

342
00:17:39,649 --> 00:17:42,527
or fall asleep smoking a cigarette

343
00:17:42,735 --> 00:17:45,947
and be burned to a crisp
right there in her smelly bed.

344
00:17:47,615 --> 00:17:51,577
Or she could fall off a ferry
and be pulled down under the water,

345
00:17:51,786 --> 00:17:54,747
the roar of the waves drowning out
her cries for help,

346
00:17:54,956 --> 00:17:59,418
until no one could hear that shrill voice
of hers, not ever again.

347
00:17:59,627 --> 00:18:02,672
Well, I'm all done with me darks.

348
00:18:06,676 --> 00:18:07,885
Listen to me.

349
00:18:08,094 --> 00:18:11,764
You should be shunning this woman,
not rewarding her with gifts.

350
00:18:11,973 --> 00:18:16,644
A baby shower for an unwed mother.
Now I've heard it all. Who's next?

351
00:18:16,852 --> 00:18:18,396
Roz. Did her mother get here all right?

352
00:18:18,604 --> 00:18:19,980
Yes, but I'm begging you,

353
00:18:20,189 --> 00:18:23,109
we could drive a stake
through that thing's heart right now!

354
00:18:23,317 --> 00:18:26,570
Roz, please, trust me.
My way is better. Get in there.

355
00:18:27,863 --> 00:18:31,534
Mrs. Mulhern, I'm Dr. Frasier Crane.
It's such a pleasure to meet you.

356
00:18:31,742 --> 00:18:35,829
Dr. Crane, I can't thank you enough
for finding me and bringing me here.

357
00:18:36,038 --> 00:18:39,458
Well, I was so moved by your story,
it's a joy to do this for you.

358
00:18:39,667 --> 00:18:42,586
For 20 years,
I've wondered where my little girl was

359
00:18:42,795 --> 00:18:44,004
and if I'd ever see her again.

360
00:18:44,213 --> 00:18:46,048
What did you two fight about
to begin with?

361
00:18:46,256 --> 00:18:47,299
Oh, I blame myself.

362
00:18:47,508 --> 00:18:50,427
I thought the man she wanted to marry
wasn't good enough for her.

363
00:18:50,636 --> 00:18:54,515
So she eloped, and I've been so afraid
the emphysema would finish me

364
00:18:54,723 --> 00:18:57,476
before I could ask her forgiveness
and tell her I love her.

365
00:18:57,935 --> 00:19:01,355
Well, tell her you shall.

366
00:19:01,563 --> 00:19:03,440
Roz?

367
00:19:04,483 --> 00:19:06,860
Forget couples therapy, Allison.
He is a loser.

368
00:19:07,069 --> 00:19:08,362
If you don't drop him right now,

369
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:10,656
you deserve every bit of misery
that you get.

370
00:19:10,864 --> 00:19:12,991
God bless, honey. Who's next?

371
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,285
We have Frasier Crane on line one.

372
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:19,289
Frasier, you wanna yell at me
for that last call?

373
00:19:19,498 --> 00:19:22,084
No, although I do believe
that a gifted therapist

374
00:19:22,292 --> 00:19:24,002
can help two people
put aside their anger

375
00:19:24,211 --> 00:19:25,963
and heal the differences
between them.

376
00:19:29,675 --> 00:19:31,259
I have someone here with me today.

377
00:19:31,468 --> 00:19:34,388
Someone you haven't seen
for quite a while.

378
00:19:34,846 --> 00:19:36,515
There's something
she'd like to tell you.

379
00:19:36,723 --> 00:19:41,895
Something she's wanted to tell you
for a very long, long time.

380
00:19:42,104 --> 00:19:44,022
Mrs. Mulhern?

381
00:19:44,231 --> 00:19:46,149
You little whore!

382
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:49,611
Mother!

383
00:19:49,819 --> 00:19:51,863
So you thought you could get away
from me, did you?

384
00:19:52,072 --> 00:19:54,324
Thought you could leave me
to rot in that dump

385
00:19:54,532 --> 00:19:57,202
without barely enough cash
for a bottle of Mateus.

386
00:19:57,369 --> 00:19:59,329
You'll pay for that, missy.

387
00:19:59,537 --> 00:20:02,374
I was wrong, Frasier.
Your way is better.

388
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:06,169
- Mrs. Mulhern!
- Keep out of this!

389
00:20:06,378 --> 00:20:09,297
- Mother, please, I am doing my show.
- Yes.

390
00:20:09,506 --> 00:20:11,966
You're Little Miss Perfect now,
aren't you?

391
00:20:12,175 --> 00:20:14,386
Telling everybody else
how wicked they are.

392
00:20:14,594 --> 00:20:16,471
They should hear about your past.

393
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:18,890
Mrs. Mulhern, please.

394
00:20:20,183 --> 00:20:23,853
The shame you brought on me,
you ungrateful tramp.

395
00:20:24,437 --> 00:20:27,774
Please, I'm a good girl now.

396
00:20:27,982 --> 00:20:32,695
How you were paid. Paid to leave town
by that nice boy's family.

397
00:20:32,904 --> 00:20:34,781
For God's sake, Nora,
go to commercial.

398
00:20:34,989 --> 00:20:36,824
There, Seattle,
now you know what I mean

399
00:20:37,033 --> 00:20:39,369
when I say there's people
you just don't need in your life.

400
00:20:39,577 --> 00:20:42,121
- Help me out, George.
- What do they pay you here?

401
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:44,082
I want my cut.

402
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:47,752
I knew that you hated me, but I just
can't believe you could be so cruel.

403
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:51,005
I was trying to help.
She seemed delightful on the phone.

404
00:20:51,214 --> 00:20:54,258
I want $50 right now.

405
00:20:54,717 --> 00:20:58,012
How many times will I have to move
before I'm finally free of her?

406
00:20:58,221 --> 00:20:59,889
Nora, I'm sorry.

407
00:21:01,015 --> 00:21:04,060
- You owe me, missy. I gave you life.
- Mrs. Mulhern.

408
00:21:04,268 --> 00:21:06,062
How could you?

409
00:21:08,439 --> 00:21:10,399
Frasier, we've got dead air.

410
00:21:12,151 --> 00:21:14,820
Hello, this is Dr. Frasier Crane.

411
00:21:15,029 --> 00:21:19,408
I'm sure Dr. Nora's listeners join me
in hoping that she and her mother

412
00:21:19,617 --> 00:21:21,410
can resolve
these differences very soon.

413
00:21:21,661 --> 00:21:24,747
They're off to a bit of a bumpy start...

414
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:30,252
...but at least
the lines of communication are open.
