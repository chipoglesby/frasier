1
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:11,671
I just had
the most wonderful time today.

2
00:00:11,838 --> 00:00:14,924
Me too. It's funny, isn't it?
We worked together all that time,

3
00:00:15,091 --> 00:00:16,551
and we never dated before this.

4
00:00:16,801 --> 00:00:19,179
- Well, anyway. I was...
- Hey, Frasier.

5
00:00:19,387 --> 00:00:20,638
- Nancy, hi.
- Roz.

6
00:00:20,847 --> 00:00:22,390
- Hi.
- So are you back to work yet?

7
00:00:22,599 --> 00:00:24,309
Almost. I start at KNFS tomorrow.

8
00:00:24,476 --> 00:00:26,936
So, Roz, Nancy and I
are having coffee.

9
00:00:27,145 --> 00:00:30,231
Oh, none for me, thanks. Listen,
can I have a fat-free muffin, please?

10
00:00:31,024 --> 00:00:32,984
Nancy, I've been dying to call you.

11
00:00:33,193 --> 00:00:36,029
My cousin just moved to town,
and I think he'd be perfect for you.

12
00:00:36,237 --> 00:00:38,948
Actually, I just started
seeing someone.

13
00:00:39,157 --> 00:00:41,284
Well, you'll forget all about him
when you meet Chuck.

14
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:46,205
He is so handsome and rugged,
and he loves the outdoors...

15
00:00:46,414 --> 00:00:48,458
Kindly leave him there.

16
00:00:49,042 --> 00:00:51,335
You see, the person
that Nancy is seeing is me.

17
00:00:51,502 --> 00:00:52,503
Really?

18
00:00:52,754 --> 00:00:55,298
- You two are dating?
- Even as we speak.

19
00:00:55,506 --> 00:00:58,843
Oh, my God. I am so sorry.
Oh, well, good for you.

20
00:00:59,051 --> 00:01:01,179
I mean, who needs Chuck
when you've got the?

21
00:01:01,387 --> 00:01:02,763
Well, the anti-Chuck.

22
00:01:04,182 --> 00:01:06,642
When my muffin gets here,
could you send it over?

23
00:01:06,851 --> 00:01:08,477
You won't even see it coming.

24
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:12,607
Well, where were we?

25
00:01:12,773 --> 00:01:14,817
I think you were about
to ask me out again.

26
00:01:15,026 --> 00:01:16,485
Oh, my gosh. So I was.

27
00:01:16,652 --> 00:01:19,530
Well, let's just see how far
this ESP of yours goes.

28
00:01:19,697 --> 00:01:21,115
What night was I thinking of?

29
00:01:21,991 --> 00:01:24,118
- Friday night.
- Astonishing!

30
00:01:24,368 --> 00:01:27,788
Busboy, clear these spoons
before she starts bending them.

31
00:01:28,414 --> 00:01:30,041
Frasier, I'm so glad you're here.

32
00:01:30,207 --> 00:01:32,835
- Niles.
- Oh, I'm sorry. Niles Crane.

33
00:01:33,043 --> 00:01:35,713
I think we've met. Nancy Cavanaugh.
I used to work at KACL.

34
00:01:35,921 --> 00:01:39,008
- Oh, of course. Talking business?
- Well, actually, no...

35
00:01:39,258 --> 00:01:41,802
Oh, good. I was afraid
I was interrupting something.

36
00:01:42,219 --> 00:01:44,597
Feast your eyes on this.

37
00:01:45,139 --> 00:01:47,016
Financial settlement?

38
00:01:47,182 --> 00:01:49,393
Good Lord, Niles, you and Maris
have come to terms?

39
00:01:49,643 --> 00:01:52,479
What was that? I couldn't hear
over the angels singing.

40
00:01:53,147 --> 00:01:55,983
Well, congratulations.
Oh, that is exciting.

41
00:01:56,191 --> 00:01:58,902
My brother's been going through
a rather rancorous divorce.

42
00:01:59,069 --> 00:02:02,322
- You must be very relieved.
- I'll say. It's cost me a fortune already.

43
00:02:02,531 --> 00:02:04,992
If she dragged it out any longer,
I'd be literally bankrupt.

44
00:02:05,242 --> 00:02:08,162
Well, I'm sure you've got
some celebrating to do, so off you go.

45
00:02:08,412 --> 00:02:10,205
I cannot wait
until I am done with this.

46
00:02:10,414 --> 00:02:11,957
I have to sign,
get her to do the same,

47
00:02:12,124 --> 00:02:14,168
and then I can take my seat
on the freedom train.

48
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:16,879
Well, all aboard!

49
00:02:19,214 --> 00:02:22,968
It's a funny thing. One day, you're
starting a new relationship full of hope.

50
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:28,682
The next you're sinking helplessly
into a sucking pit of despair.

51
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:32,019
Leaves you filled
with the bitter bile of regret.

52
00:02:32,728 --> 00:02:34,604
You're on a date, aren't you?

53
00:02:36,732 --> 00:02:39,276
- It's hard to say at this point.
- I am so sorry.

54
00:02:39,443 --> 00:02:41,903
Oh, it's all right.
I have to go anyway.

55
00:02:42,112 --> 00:02:44,156
- It was nice seeing you again.
- Yes, you too.

56
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:47,117
- Frasier, I am so sor...
- What the hell is wrong with you?

57
00:02:47,659 --> 00:02:48,910
Here we are.

58
00:02:49,161 --> 00:02:51,288
- We're on for Friday night?
- Yes, of course we are.

59
00:02:51,496 --> 00:02:54,332
You know, I was wondering,
maybe we could just...

60
00:02:54,499 --> 00:02:56,877
Have dinner at your place?

61
00:02:57,085 --> 00:02:58,253
Well, yes.

62
00:02:58,461 --> 00:03:00,338
That's amazing.
You read my mind again.

63
00:03:00,589 --> 00:03:03,550
I thought it would be more comfortable.
We could curl up on the couch,

64
00:03:03,717 --> 00:03:05,051
make a nice fire...

65
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:07,387
Can you guess
what I'm thinking now?

66
00:03:08,346 --> 00:03:10,640
Oh, you are good, aren't you?

67
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:22,152
- Hey, guys.
- Hey there.

68
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,821
- Who won the squash game?
- It's not about winning or losing,

69
00:03:25,029 --> 00:03:27,699
- it's about the thrill of competition.
- Congratulations, Niles.

70
00:03:27,866 --> 00:03:29,409
Thanks, Dad.

71
00:03:30,702 --> 00:03:32,162
Pumped as I was,
I don't think anybody

72
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:34,581
could've beat me today,
even an actual athlete.

73
00:03:35,832 --> 00:03:37,709
- Sherry, Niles?
- Yes, thank you.

74
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:40,128
Maris and I have reached
a financial settlement.

75
00:03:40,336 --> 00:03:42,964
Oh, that's great!

76
00:03:44,382 --> 00:03:46,092
This is wonderful.

77
00:03:46,301 --> 00:03:48,928
Well, as wonderful as
the tragic ripping apart of two lovers

78
00:03:49,095 --> 00:03:51,306
once bound
in a sacred union can be.

79
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,727
- No, it's brilliant, Dr. Crane.
- Thanks, Daphne.

80
00:03:55,935 --> 00:03:57,437
As long as you're doing the laundry,

81
00:03:57,603 --> 00:03:59,731
- let me throw in my gym towel.
- All right.

82
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:02,942
If you've got a couple of minutes,
I can also give you these squash togs.

83
00:04:03,109 --> 00:04:05,403
Oh, let's save some of the fun
for tomorrow.

84
00:04:06,904 --> 00:04:09,448
What's this? Cartier?

85
00:04:09,615 --> 00:04:11,826
- Niles, did you put this in there?
- No.

86
00:04:12,034 --> 00:04:13,661
Somebody must have
slipped it in my bag

87
00:04:13,828 --> 00:04:15,371
when we were at the court.

88
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,957
That's odd. I don't remember
anyone touching our things

89
00:04:18,165 --> 00:04:20,376
other than the valet
and Jaime, the squash porter.

90
00:04:20,626 --> 00:04:23,796
Boy, you boys really work up
quite a sweat down there, don't you?

91
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,924
Oh, my goodness.
Niles, look at this.

92
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:30,344
Cuff links! They're beautiful.

93
00:04:30,553 --> 00:04:33,556
There's a card in here. Let's see.

94
00:04:33,723 --> 00:04:35,766
"I still think of you constantly.

95
00:04:35,933 --> 00:04:37,977
I was wrong to ever let you go.

96
00:04:38,185 --> 00:04:39,645
Do you believe in second chances?"

97
00:04:39,854 --> 00:04:41,897
- It's unsigned.
- "Wrong to let you go."

98
00:04:42,148 --> 00:04:44,191
It sounds like it's from someone
who dumped you.

99
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:49,071
Well, that's no short list now, is it?

100
00:04:51,615 --> 00:04:53,742
Maybe it's that Sonia woman
he was going out with.

101
00:04:53,909 --> 00:04:56,203
- Yeah, wasn't there a sister too?
- And a niece.

102
00:04:56,412 --> 00:04:58,455
He went through that family
like a recessive gene.

103
00:04:58,622 --> 00:04:59,999
Yes, well...

104
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:03,711
Not to disrupt the think tank,
but there is an easy way to find out.

105
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:06,380
I'll just make a few
well-placed enquiries

106
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:08,674
and see where I get a nibble.

107
00:05:09,717 --> 00:05:10,801
Oh, yes.

108
00:05:11,635 --> 00:05:13,429
There's a group of people
that might regret

109
00:05:13,637 --> 00:05:18,016
having left Club Frasier
before last call.

110
00:05:19,226 --> 00:05:20,769
Oh, yeah, Patricia.

111
00:05:22,354 --> 00:05:25,774
And there's, oh, Susan, yes.

112
00:05:25,983 --> 00:05:29,236
Tatiana. Oh, boy...

113
00:05:29,736 --> 00:05:32,114
Frasier, all during squash
the whole thing you talked about

114
00:05:32,281 --> 00:05:33,782
was this wonderful woman
in your life.

115
00:05:33,949 --> 00:05:35,993
You're gonna drop her
to chase after someone else?

116
00:05:36,243 --> 00:05:38,370
I'm not dropping Nancy. I'm just...

117
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:41,623
- Weighing your options?
- Well, all right. So, what if I am?

118
00:05:41,832 --> 00:05:43,208
I don't believe this.

119
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:46,294
Niles, all of my life I have dreamt
of the day when I would be pursued

120
00:05:46,503 --> 00:05:48,046
by more than one woman.
What man hasn't?

121
00:05:48,255 --> 00:05:50,549
Do you blame me for enjoying it
now that the day is here?

122
00:05:50,757 --> 00:05:53,760
All my whole life I had to listen
to you whine about your dating woes.

123
00:05:53,969 --> 00:05:56,430
You have a chance for something
good. You're gonna risk it?

124
00:05:56,596 --> 00:05:58,640
- You're jealous, that's what.
- I am not jealous.

125
00:05:58,807 --> 00:06:00,308
- You're foolish.
- Come on. Nonsense.

126
00:06:00,475 --> 00:06:02,853
- Dad, don't you agree?
- Let's ask Dad. What do you think?

127
00:06:03,019 --> 00:06:05,397
Oh, no, don't drag me into this.

128
00:06:05,605 --> 00:06:08,775
I learned when you were kids to stay
out of it whenever you started fighting.

129
00:06:09,025 --> 00:06:11,736
I'd just wait till the whole thing ended,
usually in tears,

130
00:06:11,903 --> 00:06:14,030
and then I'd take you both out
for ice cream.

131
00:06:14,197 --> 00:06:17,200
That was my job, ice-cream man.

132
00:06:17,909 --> 00:06:20,203
Yeah, I suppose fathers
are the same everywhere.

133
00:06:20,412 --> 00:06:21,913
Mine couldn't bear to see us fight.

134
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,083
If there was so much as a peep out
of us, he'd be out the door to the pub,

135
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:28,169
stay for a few hours,
sometimes overnight.

136
00:06:28,336 --> 00:06:30,046
When they brought him back
the next morning,

137
00:06:30,255 --> 00:06:32,549
we couldn't fight
because of his headaches.

138
00:06:34,092 --> 00:06:37,929
I suppose that was part of his plan
to keep harmony in the family.

139
00:06:38,138 --> 00:06:39,222
God bless him.

140
00:06:41,558 --> 00:06:44,435
Oh, Daphne, wait up.
I'll ride down with you.

141
00:06:44,936 --> 00:06:47,689
Frasier, you have a chance
for something real with Nancy.

142
00:06:47,939 --> 00:06:50,066
Only a fool would throw that away
chasing after some...

143
00:06:50,275 --> 00:06:51,651
- It's here!
- Oh, oh, wait for me.

144
00:06:51,818 --> 00:06:53,778
- Pie in the sky.

145
00:06:54,988 --> 00:06:56,781
What an idiot.

146
00:07:01,619 --> 00:07:04,789
Tatiana? Frasier Crane calling.

147
00:07:04,956 --> 00:07:07,959
Yes, pick up if you're there.

148
00:07:08,709 --> 00:07:11,003
Well, I guess I've missed you.

149
00:07:11,212 --> 00:07:13,756
The question is:

150
00:07:13,923 --> 00:07:16,300
Have you missed me?

151
00:07:18,594 --> 00:07:21,222
- Oh, hi, Frasier.
- Hi, Roz.

152
00:07:21,389 --> 00:07:24,141
- Why so glum?
- Why else?

153
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:26,644
The weekend's starting again,
and I don't have a date.

154
00:07:27,186 --> 00:07:29,397
Do you know how long
it's been since?

155
00:07:30,398 --> 00:07:33,067
You know. I probably forgot how.

156
00:07:33,275 --> 00:07:35,486
Oh, no, Roz.
I'm sure it'll come back to you.

157
00:07:35,653 --> 00:07:37,113
It's just like riding a bicyclist.

158
00:07:37,321 --> 00:07:39,448
Bicycle.

159
00:07:42,076 --> 00:07:44,036
You're in the same boat.
Why don't you come over,

160
00:07:44,245 --> 00:07:47,248
hang out with me and Alice?
I'll rent a movie. We can order pizza.

161
00:07:47,498 --> 00:07:49,375
I'd love to.
Just, I've got a date with Nancy.

162
00:07:49,917 --> 00:07:51,418
- That's still going on?
- Yes.

163
00:07:51,627 --> 00:07:53,754
In fact, we're going out tonight
on our third date.

164
00:07:53,921 --> 00:07:58,008
You know the kind.
It's like one of your first dates.

165
00:08:00,678 --> 00:08:02,388
- Well, I gotta go.
- All right.

166
00:08:02,554 --> 00:08:04,098
You're Dr. Crane, right?

167
00:08:04,306 --> 00:08:08,060
- Yes, I am. Can I help you?
- A woman dropped this off for you.

168
00:08:08,394 --> 00:08:10,270
Oh, my gosh.

169
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:12,690
It must be another gift
from my secret admirer.

170
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:15,943
- You've got a secret admirer?
- Yes, I do. In fact, the other day

171
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:19,279
she sent me these cuff links.
At least, I think it's the same woman.

172
00:08:19,488 --> 00:08:22,574
Unless a third person
has thrown her hat into the ring.

173
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:24,910
Oh, my God. You have two women?

174
00:08:25,119 --> 00:08:27,246
- At least.
- And you're juggling them,

175
00:08:27,412 --> 00:08:29,373
and you're getting jewellery?

176
00:08:29,581 --> 00:08:30,916
Why is that so hard to believe?

177
00:08:31,124 --> 00:08:34,211
Well, I guess since they cloned
that sheep, anything's possible.

178
00:08:36,713 --> 00:08:39,967
- Hey, Roz. Hey, Fras.
- Oh, hey, Frasier.

179
00:08:40,175 --> 00:08:41,718
- Dad, Niles.
- What is this?

180
00:08:41,927 --> 00:08:44,054
Oh, not another gift
from your mystery woman.

181
00:08:44,262 --> 00:08:46,390
Yes. Yes, indeed, it is.

182
00:08:47,432 --> 00:08:48,517
Oh, my God.

183
00:08:48,725 --> 00:08:51,019
It's a Patek Philippe pocket watch.

184
00:08:51,228 --> 00:08:53,021
That is stunning!

185
00:08:53,271 --> 00:08:55,565
I almost bought one like that
on my honeymoon.

186
00:08:55,816 --> 00:08:59,820
Only, Maris thought it was impractical
so we got that glockenspiel instead.

187
00:09:00,612 --> 00:09:02,155
So who do you think
this stuff is from?

188
00:09:02,364 --> 00:09:06,201
Gosh, I haven't smoked her out yet,
but she certainly has exquisite taste.

189
00:09:06,409 --> 00:09:09,496
Doesn't have a bad eye
for jewellery either.

190
00:09:10,747 --> 00:09:15,001
He was like this last night. It was
all I could do to keep my beer down.

191
00:09:15,502 --> 00:09:16,586
Well, lookie there.

192
00:09:17,712 --> 00:09:19,422
No, no, no, Dad.

193
00:09:19,923 --> 00:09:21,341
That's Tina Dalton.

194
00:09:21,508 --> 00:09:24,177
We dated last summer.

195
00:09:24,552 --> 00:09:30,975
And now, it turns out she's in the café
just as this little bauble arrives.

196
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:35,480
Coincidence? I think not.

197
00:09:36,648 --> 00:09:38,024
Frasier, before you go over there...

198
00:09:38,233 --> 00:09:39,859
I've had enough
of your finger-wagging.

199
00:09:40,026 --> 00:09:42,070
I am doing what any red-blooded
American man would.

200
00:09:42,237 --> 00:09:44,280
There's nothing wrong
with playing the field.

201
00:09:44,489 --> 00:09:47,408
Looks like you've been eating the field.
What did you have for lunch?

202
00:09:47,575 --> 00:09:51,329
Pesto. Oh, my God.
All right, I better go freshen up.

203
00:09:53,248 --> 00:09:55,375
Look at this mess.

204
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:57,919
You know, it's too bad
it's not bubblewrap.

205
00:09:58,127 --> 00:10:00,004
You don't know what funny is
until you see Eddie

206
00:10:00,213 --> 00:10:02,090
go at a sheet of that stuff.

207
00:10:04,509 --> 00:10:07,178
He gets all scared, runs away,

208
00:10:07,345 --> 00:10:10,848
and then... screws up his courage
and comes back again.

209
00:10:11,599 --> 00:10:13,893
And he runs away again.

210
00:10:15,561 --> 00:10:18,564
Yes, I watched him
for an hour one time.

211
00:10:18,815 --> 00:10:23,027
You know, it's amazing how entertained
you can be by something so simple.

212
00:10:35,581 --> 00:10:37,208
Oh, my...

213
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:39,043
What is it?

214
00:10:39,251 --> 00:10:43,089
This card that came with the gift,
Frasier must not have noticed it.

215
00:10:43,255 --> 00:10:48,052
"Missing you every moment,
my dear, sweet Niles."

216
00:10:49,804 --> 00:10:51,931
- Do you realise what this means?
- Well, yeah.

217
00:10:52,181 --> 00:10:53,891
You're the one
with the secret admirer.

218
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,726
And a pretty nice watch too!

219
00:10:59,021 --> 00:11:02,358
Well, I don't get this.
How could this happen?

220
00:11:02,608 --> 00:11:06,445
Well, the other gift was left
in Frasier's squash bag,

221
00:11:06,612 --> 00:11:07,780
which is exactly like mine.

222
00:11:07,947 --> 00:11:11,533
And I guess today the waitress
must've mistaken Frasier for me.

223
00:11:13,661 --> 00:11:16,455
- You don't suppose it's Daphne.
- Yeah, she took the second job

224
00:11:16,622 --> 00:11:20,292
washing that old Mrs. Lumpkin's hair
just so she could give you Cartier.

225
00:11:21,335 --> 00:11:23,796
Besides, the note says
it's someone you've been with.

226
00:11:26,048 --> 00:11:28,092
There have been
so few women since Maris.

227
00:11:28,258 --> 00:11:30,469
There were so few women
before Maris.

228
00:11:30,677 --> 00:11:33,222
- Hence, there was Maris.
- I bet it is Maris.

229
00:11:33,388 --> 00:11:35,265
You said you saw that watch
on your honeymoon.

230
00:11:35,474 --> 00:11:36,725
Oh, that's... That's absurd.

231
00:11:36,892 --> 00:11:38,936
Dad, we're in the process
of finalizing a divorce...

232
00:11:39,102 --> 00:11:42,105
Excuse me, miss? Do you remember
the woman who brought this box in?

233
00:11:42,272 --> 00:11:46,109
Yeah, she was a very well-dressed
and really, really thin.

234
00:11:46,985 --> 00:11:48,612
Well, that could be a lot of people.

235
00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:51,448
She just dropped off the gift
and then ordered a whole-milk mocha

236
00:11:51,615 --> 00:11:53,325
with whipped cream
and chocolate shavings.

237
00:11:53,575 --> 00:11:57,746
- Oh, thank God. That's not her.
- Yeah, it was really weird, though.

238
00:11:57,954 --> 00:12:02,334
She took a really long whiff of it,
and then just handed it back.

239
00:12:11,301 --> 00:12:14,471
Well, thank you, Marta,
you've been very helpful.

240
00:12:15,138 --> 00:12:17,265
Well, turns out
Schenkman dropped Maris,

241
00:12:17,516 --> 00:12:20,685
- and now she wants me back again.
- Well, that was fun.

242
00:12:20,852 --> 00:12:22,896
We had a little catching up to do,
but it turns out

243
00:12:23,063 --> 00:12:24,439
she wasn't the woman
sending gifts.

244
00:12:24,606 --> 00:12:27,275
Yeah, we know.
The gifts are from Maris.

245
00:12:28,234 --> 00:12:32,697
Maris is my secret admirer?

246
00:12:34,491 --> 00:12:36,785
- No, she sent them to me.
- But they're...?

247
00:12:37,786 --> 00:12:40,163
Schenkman dumped her
and she wants me back.

248
00:12:40,371 --> 00:12:43,374
- How do you feel about this?
- Well, frankly, I feel a little injured.

249
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:46,461
I thought I had a secret admirer.

250
00:12:46,711 --> 00:12:49,380
Well, no matter, I do have a date
with Nancy tonight.

251
00:12:49,547 --> 00:12:51,925
You know, it's our third date.

252
00:12:52,175 --> 00:12:54,052
I was talking to Niles.

253
00:12:55,553 --> 00:12:59,474
I guess I'll just have to go over
and talk to Maris and set her straight.

254
00:12:59,724 --> 00:13:01,351
I don't know
if that's a very good idea.

255
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:03,269
Well, I'm up to my ears in debt.

256
00:13:03,478 --> 00:13:06,397
I need her to sign this settlement.
She'll never do that if there's hope

257
00:13:06,564 --> 00:13:08,941
- of us getting together.
- It just seems dangerous to me,

258
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:11,444
confronting her when
she's so vulnerable, don't you agree?

259
00:13:11,694 --> 00:13:13,821
Don't ask me.
I'm just the ice-cream man.

260
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:15,782
Thanks a lot. Listen.

261
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:17,617
Niles, I think
this whole pursuit of you

262
00:13:17,784 --> 00:13:19,660
has been brought on
by a panicked reaction

263
00:13:19,827 --> 00:13:20,828
to Schenkman dumping her.

264
00:13:21,037 --> 00:13:23,790
You know, give her a few days,
she'll probably realise that herself.

265
00:13:23,956 --> 00:13:26,959
- That's when you should approach.
- I can't wait. Do you have any idea

266
00:13:27,126 --> 00:13:29,795
how insulting it is that she thinks
she can buy me with trinkets?

267
00:13:29,962 --> 00:13:32,423
I am this close to being free,
financially and emotionally.

268
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:36,260
- I'm going to settle this right now.
- Niles, I just think you should wait.

269
00:13:37,386 --> 00:13:39,513
Oh, God.

270
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,184
Well, he certainly
dashed out of here in a hurry.

271
00:13:43,351 --> 00:13:46,354
- I suppose that's a good thing though.
- Yeah, he's not gonna back down.

272
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:49,940
That, and he forgot these cuff links.
I've got a date tonight.

273
00:13:55,446 --> 00:13:58,616
Oh, Daphne, thanks again
for taking Dad over to Niles' for me.

274
00:13:58,824 --> 00:14:01,202
I mean, I would do it myself,
but since you are going out...

275
00:14:01,452 --> 00:14:04,205
I'm going to a party
three floors down from here.

276
00:14:06,123 --> 00:14:09,460
Oh, gosh, I'm so sorry. I had no idea.
I didn't mean for you

277
00:14:09,668 --> 00:14:13,714
to miss any of the fun.
Dad, shake a leg. Daphne's in a hurry.

278
00:14:14,256 --> 00:14:16,383
You know, I'm really glad
he's going over there.

279
00:14:16,634 --> 00:14:18,844
No idea what condition
Niles will be in after Maris.

280
00:14:19,011 --> 00:14:21,764
Yeah, it's a shame
about Dr. And Mrs. Crane.

281
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:24,725
It seems so difficult these days
to make something last.

282
00:14:25,142 --> 00:14:29,063
To find someone to grow old with
and share all of life's little details.

283
00:14:29,229 --> 00:14:31,607
I only hope someday
I'll find that kind of intimacy.

284
00:14:31,815 --> 00:14:32,900
I'm sure you will, Daphne.

285
00:14:33,108 --> 00:14:34,902
Daphne, where the hell is my scarf?

286
00:14:35,068 --> 00:14:37,362
- In your sleeve where it always is.
- Oh, all right.

287
00:14:37,571 --> 00:14:40,240
Come on, let's get going.
There's construction by the waterfront.

288
00:14:40,407 --> 00:14:42,451
We're not going that way,
we're taking my shortcut.

289
00:14:42,618 --> 00:14:44,995
I know your shortcuts,
and the waterfront's faster.

290
00:14:45,162 --> 00:14:46,496
Now, don't start with me.

291
00:14:46,663 --> 00:14:48,540
Don't you start with me,
or I'll leave you here.

292
00:14:48,749 --> 00:14:50,792
Oh, hi, how are you doing?
Come on in.

293
00:14:51,627 --> 00:14:53,754
And we're turning on
my radio station in the car.

294
00:14:53,921 --> 00:14:57,007
Fine. It's better
than listening to you talk.

295
00:14:58,091 --> 00:15:00,927
- Is this a bad time?
- No, no, no, that's a bad time.

296
00:15:01,094 --> 00:15:02,179
- Hi.
- Hi.

297
00:15:02,346 --> 00:15:04,056
Boy, you look sensational.

298
00:15:04,306 --> 00:15:06,767
- Thank you. So do you.
- Oh, thank you very much.

299
00:15:06,975 --> 00:15:09,102
- Can I interest you in a glass of wine?
- Perfect.

300
00:15:09,269 --> 00:15:11,062
- Lovely.
- I've been here before, you know.

301
00:15:11,271 --> 00:15:12,814
Two years ago
for your Christmas party.

302
00:15:12,981 --> 00:15:15,609
- Really?
- I don't remember this chair.

303
00:15:15,817 --> 00:15:19,070
Oh, well, normally there's something
draped over it, my father.

304
00:15:20,447 --> 00:15:22,073
Oh, there's a message
on your machine.

305
00:15:22,282 --> 00:15:23,992
Must've come in
while I was cooking dinner.

306
00:15:24,201 --> 00:15:26,244
I mention it because
I gave my secretary your number

307
00:15:26,453 --> 00:15:28,496
so she can call about
tomorrow morning's conference

308
00:15:28,663 --> 00:15:30,790
in case, you know,
I don't find my way home tonight.

309
00:15:30,957 --> 00:15:34,377
Oh, well, you just reverse
the directions I gave you earlier...

310
00:15:41,301 --> 00:15:43,344
Feel free to check the machine
if you like.

311
00:15:43,511 --> 00:15:46,473
I'll just go stir the risotto.

312
00:15:47,223 --> 00:15:49,517
<i>Frasier, this is Cheryl
returning your call</i>

313
00:15:49,726 --> 00:15:52,645
<i>and no, I didn't send you anything.</i>

314
00:15:52,854 --> 00:15:54,647
<i>I thought I told you
when we broke up:</i>

315
00:15:54,856 --> 00:15:56,900
<i>It's over.</i>

316
00:15:57,650 --> 00:16:01,154
Boy, is that old message still on there?
Cheryl and I broke up so long ago,

317
00:16:01,362 --> 00:16:05,408
<i>- I can't even remember when.
- Friday, 6:51 p.m.</i>

318
00:16:08,578 --> 00:16:10,622
I know it was a Friday.

319
00:16:10,788 --> 00:16:13,541
Oh, well, we all have exes.

320
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:15,335
As long as it's over. It is over, right?

321
00:16:15,543 --> 00:16:17,420
Oh, God, yes. It certainly is over.

322
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:20,339
Oh, Nancy, please.
Here, come sit with me.

323
00:16:20,506 --> 00:16:25,887
Listen, I want to tell you,
I'm not interested in anyone but you.

324
00:16:30,057 --> 00:16:32,268
Perhaps I better get that.
That could be your secretary.

325
00:16:32,518 --> 00:16:34,896
Oh, let the machine get it.

326
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:38,608
<i>Frasier, it's Denise.
I don't know how you got my number,</i>

327
00:16:38,774 --> 00:16:41,068
<i>but I'm not interested
in dating you again.</i>

328
00:16:41,277 --> 00:16:44,780
Denise, you prankster!

329
00:16:46,282 --> 00:16:47,742
No. No, no. I won't.

330
00:16:47,908 --> 00:16:50,661
No, absolutely not.
I promise, never again.

331
00:16:53,748 --> 00:16:55,458
Well, how about
we have that dinner now?

332
00:16:55,624 --> 00:16:59,211
I don't believe this. You have
been calling other women for dates.

333
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,880
- How could you lie?
- I didn't lie.

334
00:17:01,088 --> 00:17:03,215
Why would I lie to you?
I have nothing to hide.

335
00:17:03,424 --> 00:17:04,884
Oh, let me get that.

336
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:06,135
Hello?

337
00:17:06,343 --> 00:17:07,344
Yes, l...

338
00:17:07,553 --> 00:17:10,181
Oh, yes, just a moment.

339
00:17:10,389 --> 00:17:11,473
It's your secretary.

340
00:17:12,016 --> 00:17:14,059
Hi, Gwen. Call me in the car
in five minutes.

341
00:17:14,268 --> 00:17:16,645
- I'm going home.
- No. No, Nancy.

342
00:17:16,854 --> 00:17:19,690
Nancy, please, please, please.
Oh, please don't be hasty.

343
00:17:19,857 --> 00:17:22,234
I realise I've done something
rather foolish.

344
00:17:22,443 --> 00:17:23,694
Just let me explain.

345
00:17:23,902 --> 00:17:27,156
Nancy, look, the truth is
I did call some women.

346
00:17:27,323 --> 00:17:29,700
I guess I was feeling insecure,

347
00:17:29,867 --> 00:17:31,660
a little nervous
about getting close to you.

348
00:17:31,869 --> 00:17:33,328
I don't blame you for being angry,

349
00:17:33,537 --> 00:17:35,831
and I wouldn't blame you
if you wanted to leave.

350
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:39,543
It's just that I think
we really have something here.

351
00:17:39,793 --> 00:17:42,504
Well, I thought
we had something too.

352
00:17:42,713 --> 00:17:44,840
I made a mistake.

353
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:46,592
Give me another chance.

354
00:17:47,885 --> 00:17:52,097
- Well, that risotto did smell good.
- Okay.

355
00:17:52,764 --> 00:17:55,767
- Frasier.
- Oh, Madeline.

356
00:17:55,934 --> 00:17:58,770
- I got that note you left under my door.
- I am so sorry about that.

357
00:17:58,979 --> 00:18:01,273
I was so happy to hear from you.

358
00:18:01,481 --> 00:18:03,442
Really?

359
00:18:03,859 --> 00:18:05,902
I was just thinking about you
the other day.

360
00:18:06,153 --> 00:18:09,406
You know, I don't even remember
why we stopped seeing each other.

361
00:18:09,614 --> 00:18:12,242
What is go...? This again?

362
00:18:12,451 --> 00:18:14,745
- Look, this date is over.
- Whoa, wait a minute.

363
00:18:14,953 --> 00:18:18,457
You slipped a note under my door,
and you're on a date with her?

364
00:18:18,707 --> 00:18:21,877
Well, you heard her.
Technically, this date is over.

365
00:18:23,545 --> 00:18:25,172
Don't ever call me again.

366
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:28,008
Or me, you freak!

367
00:18:28,216 --> 00:18:31,303
Nancy, Madeline.
Please, give me a second chance.

368
00:18:31,553 --> 00:18:33,013
Either one of you.

369
00:18:36,182 --> 00:18:38,143
So then Daphne takes a left
on Madison.

370
00:18:38,351 --> 00:18:40,895
Bumper to bumper, all the way to Pike.
Then a right on Pike.

371
00:18:41,104 --> 00:18:43,815
And what do you know?
Kingdome traffic. So I say...

372
00:18:44,024 --> 00:18:45,817
- Dear God, this is taking forever.
- Exactly.

373
00:18:46,026 --> 00:18:47,902
And here we are on 5th...

374
00:18:48,111 --> 00:18:50,321
Wait, wait, don't go away.
I'm coming.

375
00:18:51,114 --> 00:18:52,198
Oh, Frasier.

376
00:18:52,449 --> 00:18:54,409
I've had one of the worst
experiences of my life.

377
00:18:54,576 --> 00:18:56,202
You took Madison?
You're as bad as Daphne.

378
00:18:56,411 --> 00:18:59,831
- What you should've done, for God...
- Oh, let it go!

379
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:04,460
Please come in.
How was your date?

380
00:19:04,627 --> 00:19:08,131
Well, Nancy discovered
that I had been pursuing other women.

381
00:19:08,298 --> 00:19:11,634
- Well, how did she find that out?
- It wasn't hard.

382
00:19:11,801 --> 00:19:14,637
You see, I pursued one
during the date.

383
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:18,308
- Well, I'm sorry.
- Yeah, so am I, Fras.

384
00:19:18,516 --> 00:19:20,810
Well, thanks, guys. I just...

385
00:19:21,019 --> 00:19:23,312
I should've listened
to your advice, Niles.

386
00:19:23,479 --> 00:19:26,441
- How did things go with Maris?
- I wish I knew.

387
00:19:26,607 --> 00:19:29,527
I returned the gifts and told her
there was no chance of reconciliation.

388
00:19:29,694 --> 00:19:33,281
She didn't get mad.
In fact, she was eerily calm.

389
00:19:33,489 --> 00:19:36,576
She just stood there
with a blank stare on her face,

390
00:19:36,784 --> 00:19:38,911
rubbing her ocelot.

391
00:19:42,623 --> 00:19:45,293
You know, they got a cream for that.

392
00:19:53,342 --> 00:19:56,929
You know, maybe she'll come around.
You've given her a lot to digest.

393
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:02,143
- Oh, no.
- What is it?

394
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:07,356
- Oh, dear God.
- I don't believe it. I...

395
00:20:07,731 --> 00:20:10,192
I thought I made myself
perfectly clear.

396
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:11,819
What is wrong with that woman?

397
00:20:12,069 --> 00:20:15,072
Why don't you start, Fras?
I'll jump in when you get hoarse.

398
00:20:24,415 --> 00:20:26,709
<i>Roses are red
Your heart is fickle</i>

399
00:20:26,917 --> 00:20:31,797
<i>When I'm through with you
All you'll have left is this nickel</i>

400
00:20:32,006 --> 00:20:33,507
Oh, no.

401
00:20:34,508 --> 00:20:36,802
- Oh, God, she's going to ruin me.
- No, no, Niles.

402
00:20:37,011 --> 00:20:38,595
You know,
maybe she's just bluffing.

403
00:20:38,762 --> 00:20:40,723
Once she's signed
the financial settlement, it's...

404
00:20:40,931 --> 00:20:42,891
She's not bluffing.

405
00:20:43,267 --> 00:20:45,811
This is the financial settlement.

406
00:20:47,271 --> 00:20:51,817
Oh, Frasier, why did I go over there?
Why didn't I listen to you?

407
00:20:52,025 --> 00:20:54,319
And why didn't I listen to you?

408
00:20:54,528 --> 00:20:56,488
If I had, I'd be sitting with Nancy
right now,

409
00:20:56,655 --> 00:21:00,158
sipping wine in front of the fire.

410
00:21:00,409 --> 00:21:02,953
I'll be stripped clean
and devoured like an animal.

411
00:21:03,203 --> 00:21:05,580
And I won't be.

412
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:11,962
All right, now.

413
00:21:12,129 --> 00:21:15,632
Enough with these long faces.

414
00:21:16,925 --> 00:21:18,385
Who wants ice cream?
