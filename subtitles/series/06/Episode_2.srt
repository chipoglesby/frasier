1
00:00:08,565 --> 00:00:11,025
I thought your father was in charge
of Christmas decorations.

2
00:00:11,234 --> 00:00:13,987
Oh, no, no, not this year.
We're doing it my way.

3
00:00:14,195 --> 00:00:16,239
That's why I'm ordering
a tasteful tree here.

4
00:00:16,406 --> 00:00:18,700
They'll even deliver it
on Christmas Eve fully decorated.

5
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:21,619
- Gee, that'll be fun for Freddie.
- Frederick won't be joining me.

6
00:00:21,828 --> 00:00:24,664
He's spending his vacation
on an archaeological tour with Lilith.

7
00:00:24,872 --> 00:00:27,417
He's spending Christmas
with dried-up old bones?

8
00:00:27,625 --> 00:00:29,001
Yes, I thought I told you.

9
00:00:29,252 --> 00:00:31,712
She's taking him
on an archaeological tour.

10
00:00:33,089 --> 00:00:34,882
Oh, good Lord,
look how late it's gotten.

11
00:00:35,133 --> 00:00:36,133
Well, don't blame me.

12
00:00:36,342 --> 00:00:40,012
You're the one who spent 20 minutes
looking for that candleholder thing.

13
00:00:40,263 --> 00:00:41,722
No, no, no. It's a menorah, Roz.

14
00:00:41,889 --> 00:00:43,766
Thought I'd get one
for Frederick for Hanukkah.

15
00:00:43,975 --> 00:00:46,978
Oh, that's right. I completely forgot
Frederick is half Jewish.

16
00:00:47,186 --> 00:00:49,563
Yes, between the Crane boy genes
and Lilith's contribution,

17
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:52,316
I'm not sure the NFL
is holding its breath.

18
00:00:52,566 --> 00:00:55,236
I need to go over to Notions
and try to find something for Calvin,

19
00:00:55,403 --> 00:00:57,363
- the security guard.
- What are you getting him?

20
00:00:57,571 --> 00:01:00,324
If I knew,
I wouldn't be going to Notions.

21
00:01:00,825 --> 00:01:03,828
Excuse me. I'd like to get a gift
for that woman I was with.

22
00:01:03,994 --> 00:01:06,247
- How about this sweater right here?
- Excellent choice.

23
00:01:06,497 --> 00:01:10,459
I'm not sure of the size. Could you
find me this in a medium? Thank you.

24
00:01:10,709 --> 00:01:13,003
- It's a madhouse in there.
- Roz!

25
00:01:13,254 --> 00:01:15,214
People pushing and shoving
for nose-hair clippers.

26
00:01:15,422 --> 00:01:18,092
Is there a nasal hair epidemic
I don't know about?

27
00:01:18,342 --> 00:01:20,302
Here's your sweater.

28
00:01:20,511 --> 00:01:23,681
- Is he talking to you?
- No, no, no, he's talking to...

29
00:01:23,889 --> 00:01:26,350
He's talking to me. It's for my niece.

30
00:01:26,558 --> 00:01:29,228
But I'm a bit worried about the size.

31
00:01:29,395 --> 00:01:31,021
You know,
she's just about your height.

32
00:01:31,188 --> 00:01:33,607
Do you mind my asking,
would this fit you?

33
00:01:33,857 --> 00:01:35,651
That's a little big for me.

34
00:01:35,859 --> 00:01:38,862
- What about the colour? A little blah?
- Personally, I like the blue.

35
00:01:39,363 --> 00:01:41,573
I agree. Thank you so much.

36
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:45,452
I will take a smaller size in the blue,
and please gift-wrap it.

37
00:01:45,702 --> 00:01:49,206
- Coming right up.
- It looks like Notions has thinned out.

38
00:01:49,373 --> 00:01:52,042
Oh, good. So you think Calvin
will like the nose hair clippers?

39
00:01:52,292 --> 00:01:54,336
I think we can be sure
he doesn't own a pair.

40
00:01:55,921 --> 00:01:58,298
Gosh, thank you so much
for bailing me out that way.

41
00:01:58,465 --> 00:02:00,259
My pleasure. Helen.

42
00:02:00,467 --> 00:02:03,637
- Helen? Frasier.
- Not Frasier Crane?

43
00:02:03,845 --> 00:02:04,972
- From the radio show?
- Yes.

44
00:02:06,139 --> 00:02:09,393
I listen to you every time I come
to Seattle to visit my daughter Faye.

45
00:02:09,643 --> 00:02:10,894
Well, that's very kind.

46
00:02:11,144 --> 00:02:13,188
You know, you really
should know your wife's size.

47
00:02:13,355 --> 00:02:16,858
- Oh, she's not my wife.
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to pry.

48
00:02:17,067 --> 00:02:18,527
- It's all right.
- Girlfriend?

49
00:02:18,777 --> 00:02:22,030
No, I don't have a girlfriend, actually.
I'm unattached.

50
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,700
Well, I've taken enough of your time.

51
00:02:25,909 --> 00:02:28,912
Although, there is one small thing
you could help me with.

52
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:30,705
I'm looking for something
for my daughter.

53
00:02:30,956 --> 00:02:32,207
Oh, what is it?

54
00:02:32,457 --> 00:02:35,543
- No, I really shouldn't ask you.
- No, no, please.

55
00:02:35,794 --> 00:02:37,420
No, no, it's too much
of an imposition.

56
00:02:37,587 --> 00:02:40,340
No, no, the way you came to my
rescue, I'd be delighted to help you.

57
00:02:40,548 --> 00:02:42,592
What is it you're looking
to get for your daughter?

58
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:46,096
A date with a nice
unattached doctor.

59
00:02:47,806 --> 00:02:50,975
Well, I certainly walked
into that one, didn't I?

60
00:02:51,476 --> 00:02:53,937
It wasn't my first time.

61
00:02:57,607 --> 00:02:58,900
As soon as this woman gets here,

62
00:02:59,109 --> 00:03:01,152
give me five minutes
and call me on my cell phone.

63
00:03:01,361 --> 00:03:04,364
If I am miserable, I will simply say
it's an emergency and excuse myself.

64
00:03:04,614 --> 00:03:06,574
Yes, the ever-valuable escape call.

65
00:03:06,783 --> 00:03:08,493
Oh, you've done them?

66
00:03:09,244 --> 00:03:10,703
No, but I've seen them done.

67
00:03:14,374 --> 00:03:15,917
Excuse me, are you Frasier?

68
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:22,382
Faye? Yes, well, hello.
How did you know it was me?

69
00:03:22,632 --> 00:03:26,219
You had that horror-stricken look
of someone who's met my mother.

70
00:03:26,469 --> 00:03:28,096
No, please, please. Shall we?

71
00:03:28,262 --> 00:03:30,807
That's sweet of you, but you
don't have to go through with this.

72
00:03:31,015 --> 00:03:32,016
I just came to apologise.

73
00:03:32,266 --> 00:03:34,143
No, please.
Please, why don't you sit down?

74
00:03:34,352 --> 00:03:36,729
Hey, Dr. Crane.
Are you here with your brother?

75
00:03:36,896 --> 00:03:38,523
No, actually, he's on a blind date.

76
00:03:41,359 --> 00:03:46,948
Oh, he is, isn't he? Oh, look at him.
I think he really fancies her.

77
00:03:47,156 --> 00:03:50,826
You know, it's always so obvious
when a man likes a woman.

78
00:03:50,993 --> 00:03:54,497
You can just tell
by his awkward body language.

79
00:03:54,705 --> 00:03:56,666
Shifting in his chair,

80
00:03:56,874 --> 00:04:00,044
he doesn't know quite
what to do with his hands.

81
00:04:00,753 --> 00:04:02,963
He's as nervous as a hen.

82
00:04:03,172 --> 00:04:05,925
Oh, for God's sakes, stop fidgeting!

83
00:04:07,301 --> 00:04:09,095
So your mother tells me
that you're a lawyer.

84
00:04:09,345 --> 00:04:10,429
Well, that's typical.

85
00:04:10,596 --> 00:04:13,849
I was a lawyer and I quit two years ago
and now I'm a pastry chef.

86
00:04:14,225 --> 00:04:15,226
- Really?
- Yes.

87
00:04:15,434 --> 00:04:16,894
I work in a French restaurant
in town.

88
00:04:17,102 --> 00:04:18,813
Maybe you've heard of it.
Le Cigare Volant?

89
00:04:19,021 --> 00:04:21,398
It's one of my favourites.
I had dinner there last Friday.

90
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:23,192
I worked Friday. What did you have?

91
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,110
- The Grand Marnier soufflé.
- I made that!

92
00:04:25,277 --> 00:04:27,488
- Well, it was poetry on a plate.
- Thank you.

93
00:04:28,072 --> 00:04:30,199
You didn't happen to find
my earring in it, did you?

94
00:04:32,368 --> 00:04:34,161
I'm kidding.

95
00:04:35,329 --> 00:04:39,375
You know, suddenly I'm glad that
your mother is as pushy as she is.

96
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:41,794
It's funny, though,
you're nothing like her.

97
00:04:42,002 --> 00:04:44,755
That's the nicest thing
anyone's ever said to me.

98
00:04:44,963 --> 00:04:47,091
Dr. Crane, can I ask a favour?

99
00:04:47,257 --> 00:04:49,134
What are you doing
for the next ten nights?

100
00:04:49,343 --> 00:04:51,220
- Because my...
- Yes.

101
00:04:53,597 --> 00:04:54,807
Excuse me, finish the question.

102
00:04:55,015 --> 00:04:58,435
Well, my neighbourhood theatre group
is putting on a holiday revue.

103
00:04:58,644 --> 00:05:01,188
We're performing in the common room
of Dr. Crane's building.

104
00:05:01,438 --> 00:05:03,065
- Right downstairs?
- Yeah.

105
00:05:03,273 --> 00:05:06,109
Well, we're still looking
for a musical director.

106
00:05:06,276 --> 00:05:09,613
I would never ask you, but they
put me in charge of the whole thing.

107
00:05:09,821 --> 00:05:11,615
Oh, well, count me in.

108
00:05:11,823 --> 00:05:13,617
Is the show more religious
in tone or secular?

109
00:05:13,825 --> 00:05:17,579
Well, we couldn't quite agree,
so we ended up with a mixed bag.

110
00:05:18,246 --> 00:05:20,123
We open with
the no-room-at-the-inn scene,

111
00:05:20,332 --> 00:05:22,376
then it's a rousing version
of "Jingle Bell Rock,"

112
00:05:22,542 --> 00:05:24,920
<i>a brief medley
from Jesus Christ Superstar.</i>

113
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:29,090
The first act ends with Santa's elves
and the Three Wise Men linking arms

114
00:05:29,299 --> 00:05:31,843
and singing "Frosty the Snowman."

115
00:05:33,345 --> 00:05:36,264
Well. Excuse me,
I have to make a phone call.

116
00:05:36,473 --> 00:05:41,102
Of course, I love Boston,
but, well, there's no place like home.

117
00:05:41,978 --> 00:05:43,855
Excuse me.

118
00:05:45,523 --> 00:05:47,400
Yes, hello?

119
00:05:48,485 --> 00:05:51,571
Yes, no, you know what?
I'll just have to sign those papers later.

120
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,406
Thank you.

121
00:05:54,783 --> 00:05:55,784
Office work.

122
00:05:56,034 --> 00:05:58,703
That was an escape call, wasn't it?

123
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,706
No, what are you talking about?

124
00:06:01,873 --> 00:06:04,709
Come on, it's a blind date.
You wanted a way to back out.

125
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:08,713
Oh, gosh, you are sharp, aren't you?
How did you know?

126
00:06:15,261 --> 00:06:18,264
Well, that would be just lovely.
All right, I'll see you soon.

127
00:06:20,141 --> 00:06:23,144
Well, isn't that nice?
Faye's dropping by.

128
00:06:23,353 --> 00:06:25,396
You've been seeing a lot of her lately,
haven't you?

129
00:06:25,605 --> 00:06:27,732
Yes, I have. You know,
she really is quite wonderful.

130
00:06:28,274 --> 00:06:30,151
Thought she was off
to Florida with her mother.

131
00:06:30,318 --> 00:06:32,278
Yes. They're popping by
on the way to the airport.

132
00:06:32,487 --> 00:06:37,992
I guess someone wanted to rack up
a few more frequent Frasier miles.

133
00:06:41,496 --> 00:06:43,956
You don't ever actually say
those things to the woman, do you?

134
00:06:44,165 --> 00:06:45,875
Oh, no, no, no.

135
00:06:48,461 --> 00:06:51,547
- Oh, good, Dr. Crane, you're here.
- Yes, the show starts in half an hour.

136
00:06:51,756 --> 00:06:52,757
Could you give me a hand?

137
00:06:52,965 --> 00:06:56,219
I still have to sew the chains to Jacob
Marley's tux for the dance number.

138
00:06:56,427 --> 00:06:58,387
- Oh, happy to.
- Jacob Marley?

139
00:06:58,596 --> 00:07:00,139
<i>They're doing
A Christmas Carol too?</i>

140
00:07:00,389 --> 00:07:03,559
No, they're not. They worked him
into the nativity scene.

141
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:08,773
Hey, Fras, where's a good spot
for Rudolph this year?

142
00:07:08,981 --> 00:07:13,194
Dad, please, I thought we had
an agreement about the decorations.

143
00:07:13,402 --> 00:07:15,362
I know, but what's Christmas
without Rudolph?

144
00:07:15,571 --> 00:07:17,364
He is not even one
of the original reindeer.

145
00:07:17,573 --> 00:07:18,699
Do the others have a song?

146
00:07:18,949 --> 00:07:20,493
I'm not having
this discussion again!

147
00:07:20,701 --> 00:07:22,411
Because you know I'm right.
Forget it.

148
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:25,873
I wouldn't want to ruin
your designer Christmas.

149
00:07:28,417 --> 00:07:30,044
- Oh, Faye!
- Hi.

150
00:07:30,211 --> 00:07:33,464
Hi. Good to see you.
Here, let me take your coat.

151
00:07:33,672 --> 00:07:35,382
- Thank you.
- Where's Helen?

152
00:07:35,591 --> 00:07:36,759
She's talking to your doorman.

153
00:07:36,967 --> 00:07:38,844
She's trying to fix him up
with my cousin Janet

154
00:07:39,053 --> 00:07:41,096
and I couldn't bear to watch.

155
00:07:41,263 --> 00:07:43,307
Oh, I'll just leave that ajar
for her there.

156
00:07:43,474 --> 00:07:45,434
- Oh, my gosh.
- What?

157
00:07:45,642 --> 00:07:48,187
- You have a wreath.
- Yes, so?

158
00:07:48,437 --> 00:07:52,566
- Aren't you Jewish?
- No. No, why do you ask?

159
00:07:52,775 --> 00:07:56,111
The day we met, my mother
saw you shopping for a menorah.

160
00:07:56,361 --> 00:07:59,114
Yes, for my son.
My ex-wife is Jewish.

161
00:07:59,323 --> 00:08:02,576
- Oh, God.
- Is there a problem?

162
00:08:02,784 --> 00:08:05,454
For me, no,
but my mother is another story.

163
00:08:05,662 --> 00:08:09,333
Here I was wondering what we'd talk
about on a seven-hour flight to Miami.

164
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:11,251
You know what,
I can just take this down.

165
00:08:11,418 --> 00:08:13,795
No, no, no, I have to stop
being a child about these things.

166
00:08:14,004 --> 00:08:15,213
If she's upset, she's upset.

167
00:08:15,464 --> 00:08:17,007
- How many stopovers do you have?
- Two.

168
00:08:17,215 --> 00:08:19,259
- I'll take it down.
- Thank you.

169
00:08:19,468 --> 00:08:22,387
- I really appreciate you doing this.
- Oh, it's no problem.

170
00:08:22,637 --> 00:08:26,058
Can't believe I'm asking you to pretend
to be Jewish on Christmas Eve.

171
00:08:26,224 --> 00:08:29,561
It's all right, really.
It probably won't even come up.

172
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:30,854
- Hello?
- Oh, there she is.

173
00:08:31,021 --> 00:08:34,524
- Hello, Frasier.
- Helen! Hi.

174
00:08:35,358 --> 00:08:37,569
Oh, what a beautiful apartment
you have.

175
00:08:37,736 --> 00:08:39,946
Thank you very much.

176
00:08:40,238 --> 00:08:42,199
Get out!

177
00:08:43,366 --> 00:08:46,620
- What?
- Of that coat already.

178
00:08:53,585 --> 00:08:57,797
- So, Frasier, you grew up in Seattle?
- Yes, as a matter of fact, I did.

179
00:08:58,006 --> 00:09:00,216
- Such a pretty city.
- Yes.

180
00:09:00,467 --> 00:09:01,926
I guess you were bar mitzvahed here.

181
00:09:02,177 --> 00:09:03,887
Oh, yes, yes, of course.

182
00:09:05,555 --> 00:09:08,475
What a proud day that was.

183
00:09:08,683 --> 00:09:12,729
I can still remember reading
from the Torah

184
00:09:13,313 --> 00:09:16,983
before the rabbi

185
00:09:18,109 --> 00:09:20,945
and the cantor and the mohel.

186
00:09:21,154 --> 00:09:22,322
The mohel?

187
00:09:24,198 --> 00:09:26,326
The one who did your circumcision?

188
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:31,956
Yes, yes, I just wanted to show him
that there were no hard feelings.

189
00:09:35,168 --> 00:09:38,838
- Niles!
- Hello, all. You must be Faye.

190
00:09:39,088 --> 00:09:40,798
And I'm her mother,
Helen Moskowitz.

191
00:09:41,049 --> 00:09:43,009
- And I'm Frasier's brother, Niles.
- Yes.

192
00:09:43,259 --> 00:09:44,260
What happened to the...?

193
00:09:44,469 --> 00:09:46,345
Moskowitz that lived down the hall?
They moved.

194
00:09:46,512 --> 00:09:48,055
Why don't you help me
in the kitchen?

195
00:09:48,222 --> 00:09:49,932
I'm just about to pour
everybody a drink.

196
00:09:51,184 --> 00:09:52,643
What's going on?

197
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:55,021
Faye's mother thinks
that we're Jewish. Just play along.

198
00:09:55,229 --> 00:09:58,733
Okay. Why?

199
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:02,486
Well, it's important to Faye,
Faye is important to me.

200
00:10:02,695 --> 00:10:05,281
- You think you can pull it off?
- No problem. Oh, ham.

201
00:10:05,489 --> 00:10:09,535
Niles. Please.

202
00:10:09,744 --> 00:10:12,204
We've got to find a time
to tell Dad about this too.

203
00:10:12,413 --> 00:10:14,874
- You mean Papa.
- Stop it.

204
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:16,959
- Wait, Frasier.
- What?

205
00:10:17,209 --> 00:10:18,586
- Is that for Helen?
- Yes.

206
00:10:18,836 --> 00:10:20,713
What if she's expecting
Jewish wine?

207
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,049
- I'm afraid I don't have that on hand.
- That's all right. It's easy enough.

208
00:10:24,216 --> 00:10:26,260
It's just like regular wine,
plus a little of this.

209
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:32,600
Try that.

210
00:10:33,851 --> 00:10:36,061
- It's dreadful.
- Perfect.

211
00:10:38,188 --> 00:10:42,067
- Here we are.
- Oh, thank you.

212
00:10:42,276 --> 00:10:45,279
Who has a nice toast? Niles?

213
00:10:45,988 --> 00:10:47,448
Oh, all right.

214
00:10:54,121 --> 00:10:56,081
Next year in Jerusalem.

215
00:10:57,499 --> 00:10:59,918
Take it down a notch, Tevye.

216
00:11:00,419 --> 00:11:02,629
Hey, Fras, you know,
since it's the night before...

217
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,840
- Dad!
- Oh, great.

218
00:11:05,048 --> 00:11:07,801
Would it be a crime for somebody
to tell me we had guests here?

219
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:11,096
Hi, I'm Marty Crane. I'm Frasier's dad.
Although you'd never guess it

220
00:11:11,305 --> 00:11:14,308
from the way I'm treated like
a second-class citizen around here.

221
00:11:14,516 --> 00:11:18,729
But, as long as Frasier's happy,
why should my feelings matter?

222
00:11:18,937 --> 00:11:21,607
Niles, why don't you see
if you can go help Dad in the kitchen?

223
00:11:21,815 --> 00:11:23,942
Well, all right,
but he'll probably just kvetch at me

224
00:11:24,151 --> 00:11:26,028
- and frankly, I don't need the tsuris.
- Niles!

225
00:11:32,868 --> 00:11:34,035
I don't know how to be Jewish.

226
00:11:34,244 --> 00:11:35,704
Just answer questions
with a question.

227
00:11:35,912 --> 00:11:37,706
- Like what?
- I have to explain everything?

228
00:11:37,956 --> 00:11:40,792
- Can't you give me an example?
- What, I should give you an example?

229
00:11:41,001 --> 00:11:42,002
You gonna help me or not?

230
00:11:42,252 --> 00:11:45,005
- You're saying I'm not being helpful?
- Oh, forget it!

231
00:11:47,048 --> 00:11:51,678
So, Marty, both your sons are doctors.
How'd you work that out?

232
00:11:51,887 --> 00:11:56,182
I have no idea... do I?

233
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,106
Well, I just got the phone call
every producer dreads.

234
00:12:03,356 --> 00:12:06,192
- What is it?
- Someone's dropping out of the show.

235
00:12:07,318 --> 00:12:09,654
You don't suppose
you could take over one of the roles?

236
00:12:09,904 --> 00:12:12,115
Well, I don't see why not.
I know all the songs.

237
00:12:12,323 --> 00:12:14,576
- Wonderful.
- Oh, it was nice meeting you both.

238
00:12:14,784 --> 00:12:17,454
Likewise. We're leaving too.
Could you send the elevator back up?

239
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:18,997
- We'll be right down.
- Happy to.

240
00:12:19,164 --> 00:12:22,000
- So who dropped out?
- Mr. Blanchard.

241
00:12:23,668 --> 00:12:25,879
It's been great spending
some time with the two of you.

242
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:27,338
I wish you could stay longer.

243
00:12:27,547 --> 00:12:30,300
Well, actually, we can.
I just called the airline.

244
00:12:30,466 --> 00:12:32,010
The plane is delayed an hour.

245
00:12:32,594 --> 00:12:34,387
Well, isn't that good news?

246
00:12:34,554 --> 00:12:36,597
You know, I hate to be forward,

247
00:12:36,806 --> 00:12:40,727
but I'd love to taste whatever smells
so wonderful in that kitchen.

248
00:12:40,935 --> 00:12:44,689
And I would love to give you a taste,
except it isn't done yet.

249
00:12:46,524 --> 00:12:49,527
Well, more good news!

250
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:55,324
I don't know how much longer
we can continue this charade.

251
00:12:55,533 --> 00:12:58,202
My God, when Dad started to talk
about working on his own car,

252
00:12:58,411 --> 00:13:00,538
I thought we were goners.

253
00:13:00,705 --> 00:13:02,999
Well, we only have to keep it up
for another half an hour.

254
00:13:03,207 --> 00:13:05,418
Actually, I think I have an idea.

255
00:13:05,626 --> 00:13:07,670
- Go out there.
- Okay.

256
00:13:07,878 --> 00:13:09,755
Well, I don't know what it is
with that brisket.

257
00:13:09,964 --> 00:13:11,340
It just won't cook through.

258
00:13:11,549 --> 00:13:13,801
- I could take a look.
- No, no, we don't have the time.

259
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:15,970
I just got off the phone
with the airlines.

260
00:13:16,178 --> 00:13:18,389
They pushed the flights back up.
We have to get going.

261
00:13:18,597 --> 00:13:20,307
Oh, really? All right.

262
00:13:20,474 --> 00:13:22,268
Gosh, you know,
I wish you could stay longer.

263
00:13:22,476 --> 00:13:25,813
It's just that I'd hate to have you
be late for your plane.

264
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:29,316
- Hello, sir.
- On the other hand, you know,

265
00:13:29,525 --> 00:13:31,485
you can't leave
until you've seen the apartment.

266
00:13:31,694 --> 00:13:33,904
- What?
- All right, let's start in the bedroom.

267
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:35,114
There's plenty of time.

268
00:13:35,322 --> 00:13:38,492
Oh, Dad, could you see who that is
and make sure they come back later?

269
00:13:38,659 --> 00:13:42,872
Whatever you want, Frasier,
as usual.

270
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:48,377
Hello, sir. Let me wish you a merry...

271
00:13:48,627 --> 00:13:49,920
Bring that thing back in an hour.

272
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:53,299
No way, sir. It's Christmas Eve
and I've got a full truck downstairs.

273
00:13:53,507 --> 00:13:55,968
- So where do you want it?
- Oh, jeez, I don't know.

274
00:13:56,176 --> 00:13:59,763
You know, a lot of people
put them in their living rooms.

275
00:14:00,013 --> 00:14:01,557
Oh, here, here,
put it in the bathroom.

276
00:14:01,724 --> 00:14:02,725
- In the bathroom?
- Yeah.

277
00:14:02,933 --> 00:14:05,310
- Okay.
- Just put it in, all right?

278
00:14:19,867 --> 00:14:22,869
- All right, come on, quick.
- Okay.

279
00:14:23,036 --> 00:14:26,123
- You have, you know, a mer...
- Shut up. Get out.

280
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:30,502
- That's a beautiful bedroom, Frasier.
- Oh, thank you, thank you very much.

281
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:33,338
I noticed you were sort of quiet,
Faye.

282
00:14:33,547 --> 00:14:36,007
Almost as though
you'd been in there before, huh?

283
00:14:36,216 --> 00:14:39,553
Oh, yeah, I have, Ma,
but I was drunk and it was dark.

284
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,472
I don't remember so much.

285
00:14:43,056 --> 00:14:45,100
You see how she talks
to her mother?

286
00:14:45,934 --> 00:14:47,477
Jesus!

287
00:14:50,939 --> 00:14:51,940
I'll tell you what.

288
00:14:52,649 --> 00:14:55,026
I just realised that you haven't seen
the beautiful balcony.

289
00:14:55,235 --> 00:14:57,821
Dad, would you do the honours
and I'll check on the brisket?

290
00:14:58,405 --> 00:14:59,406
What is going on?

291
00:14:59,614 --> 00:15:02,367
<i>The man who does the number from
Jesus Christ Superstar can't go on.</i>

292
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:04,911
He slipped in the shower.
Man could walk on water, but no...

293
00:15:05,078 --> 00:15:06,621
Yes, it's dripping with irony.

294
00:15:07,414 --> 00:15:09,040
Niles, what are you doing here?

295
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:12,043
The minute I got within ten feet
of the hay for the manger scene,

296
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:14,713
my allergies kicked in.
I think I left my nasal spray here.

297
00:15:14,921 --> 00:15:17,173
I am terribly sorry,
but you've got to get out of here!

298
00:15:17,382 --> 00:15:20,468
- Is that kind of language appropriate?
- Oh, just shut up!

299
00:15:24,055 --> 00:15:26,891
Would you believe it?
It's still pink in the middle.

300
00:15:27,058 --> 00:15:31,688
By the time my brisket's done,
my kugel will be dry as the Sinai.

301
00:15:42,615 --> 00:15:47,495
It certainly is beautiful,
but now I think we're cutting it close.

302
00:15:47,704 --> 00:15:49,914
Yes, you know, you're quite right.

303
00:15:50,123 --> 00:15:51,833
We can continue the tour
at another time.

304
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:53,251
Let me walk you to the door.

305
00:15:53,459 --> 00:15:56,712
Thank you so much, Frasier.
You're a wonderful host.

306
00:15:56,921 --> 00:15:57,922
Oh, well.

307
00:15:58,131 --> 00:16:01,300
You know, maybe I should go
to the powder room before we go.

308
00:16:01,467 --> 00:16:03,886
Oh, here, allow me.

309
00:16:13,354 --> 00:16:14,522
What is going on?

310
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:17,233
Helen, I am so terribly sorry.

311
00:16:19,944 --> 00:16:22,363
I'll let you all sort this out.
I really have to go.

312
00:16:22,613 --> 00:16:25,366
I understand. This is your busy time.

313
00:16:30,621 --> 00:16:33,707
Ma, Frasier's not Jewish.

314
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:35,960
I told them to pretend
so you wouldn't freak out.

315
00:16:36,168 --> 00:16:40,548
What? You think I care?
You can date anyone you want.

316
00:16:40,756 --> 00:16:41,757
Since when?

317
00:16:41,966 --> 00:16:44,093
I can't believe
you're embarrassing me like this.

318
00:16:44,343 --> 00:16:45,803
You embarrass me
on an hourly basis.

319
00:16:46,011 --> 00:16:47,555
I embarrass you?
Are you hearing this?

320
00:16:47,763 --> 00:16:49,890
You know, maybe we should
just give you your privacy.

321
00:16:50,099 --> 00:16:52,393
No one leaves. You see?

322
00:16:52,643 --> 00:16:55,020
You are making them uncomfortable
in their own home.

323
00:16:55,229 --> 00:16:56,939
You could have trusted me
to understand.

324
00:16:57,106 --> 00:16:58,983
All I want is for you to be happy.

325
00:16:59,191 --> 00:17:01,944
As long as I'm happy in the life
that you pick out for me.

326
00:17:02,194 --> 00:17:04,947
Excuse me for being
a terrible mother.

327
00:17:05,155 --> 00:17:06,865
All I do is care.

328
00:17:07,116 --> 00:17:08,575
Oh, here it comes, the guilt.

329
00:17:08,742 --> 00:17:11,203
Just because I don't want you
controlling my whole life.

330
00:17:11,412 --> 00:17:14,748
What do you want me to do about it,
cut myself out of it? You hate me?

331
00:17:14,957 --> 00:17:17,876
Sometimes, I do hate you!

332
00:17:22,548 --> 00:17:26,593
I'm sorry, Ma.
I shouldn't have said that.

333
00:17:26,802 --> 00:17:32,474
Why not? I am too involved.
It's because you're all I have.

334
00:17:32,683 --> 00:17:34,810
But you can't keep running my life.

335
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:39,189
- Maybe we should just...
- Sit. We're nearly done.

336
00:17:43,568 --> 00:17:45,779
I have been smothering you.

337
00:17:45,946 --> 00:17:47,656
Maybe it's time I learned
to let you go.

338
00:17:47,864 --> 00:17:48,865
I don't wanna be let go.

339
00:17:49,074 --> 00:17:51,451
I want you in my life,
just not running it.

340
00:17:51,618 --> 00:17:56,957
- I do love you, Mom.
- Oh, baby. I love you too.

341
00:18:02,212 --> 00:18:04,673
- Well, we should go.
- Right.

342
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:12,389
Oh, thank you for a lovely visit.
Enjoy your holiday.

343
00:18:12,931 --> 00:18:15,934
- I am so sorry about all this.
- Oh, that's all right. That's all right.

344
00:18:16,142 --> 00:18:17,519
Call me when you get back.

345
00:18:21,773 --> 00:18:23,483
Good night.

346
00:18:24,859 --> 00:18:27,529
- Boy, that was something.
- It certainly was.

347
00:18:27,737 --> 00:18:30,406
Yeah, we've had a couple squabbles
today, but nothing like that.

348
00:18:30,573 --> 00:18:32,700
No way.

349
00:18:33,451 --> 00:18:35,829
Maybe I should get that
Christmas tree out of the bathroom.

350
00:18:35,995 --> 00:18:39,332
Yeah, right. One minute, they're
talking about one little problem,

351
00:18:39,499 --> 00:18:42,168
then suddenly, it's everything else.

352
00:18:42,418 --> 00:18:44,963
Then it gets all emotional
and messy,

353
00:18:45,171 --> 00:18:48,925
and then they're hugging
and then it's all over.

354
00:18:49,175 --> 00:18:51,219
I suppose that's the healthiest way
to go about it.

355
00:18:51,386 --> 00:18:53,846
Yeah, yeah. I guess
you can't keep that stuff bottled up.

356
00:18:54,055 --> 00:18:56,015
No, you sit on it,
you just get madder and madder.

357
00:18:56,224 --> 00:18:57,850
Yeah, best thing
is lay it on the line.

358
00:18:58,101 --> 00:18:59,185
- Exactly.
- Yeah.

359
00:18:59,394 --> 00:19:03,689
Frasier, I want my Rudolph
out for Christmas.

360
00:19:04,148 --> 00:19:06,984
- What, this again?
- It's just not Christmas without it.

361
00:19:07,151 --> 00:19:09,987
Dad, we had an agreement about
the Christmas decorations this year.

362
00:19:10,196 --> 00:19:13,783
Yeah, but your Christmas stinks!
I mean, you call that a tree?

363
00:19:13,991 --> 00:19:17,828
Would it kill you to have a tasteful
Christmas just once in your life?

364
00:19:18,037 --> 00:19:19,497
Every year,
we do Christmas your way.

365
00:19:19,705 --> 00:19:22,250
And you have things your way
every damn day! I mean, look at it.

366
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:24,919
There's nothing of mine
around this place except for my chair.

367
00:19:25,127 --> 00:19:27,254
And you've taken potshots
at that right from the start

368
00:19:27,463 --> 00:19:29,757
because it doesn't fit in
with your froufrou knickknacks.

369
00:19:29,965 --> 00:19:31,842
Right, go ahead,
ridicule everything I do.

370
00:19:32,051 --> 00:19:33,928
The way I eat, the way I decorate.

371
00:19:34,095 --> 00:19:35,971
Do you have any idea
how that makes me feel?

372
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:38,474
Know how it makes me feel
to live like a guest in my home?

373
00:19:38,682 --> 00:19:40,893
I do everything to make you feel
welcome in this house,

374
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,436
but nothing I do is good enough!

375
00:19:42,645 --> 00:19:45,022
Strange way to make me feel
welcome, taking Christmas away.

376
00:19:45,231 --> 00:19:47,691
The one time of the year
when I get to do things my way,

377
00:19:47,858 --> 00:19:51,278
like it used to be in our home, with
your mother and when you were kids.

378
00:19:51,445 --> 00:19:52,905
You know,
that's a nice memory for me.

379
00:19:53,113 --> 00:19:55,449
You'd think, as a psychiatrist,
you'd figure that out.

380
00:19:55,699 --> 00:19:57,576
Oh, fine. Now, I'm not even
a good psychiatrist.

381
00:19:57,785 --> 00:19:59,495
I'm just a big, fat letdown, aren't I?

382
00:19:59,703 --> 00:20:01,330
I'm a burden to you.
I hate living here.

383
00:20:01,538 --> 00:20:03,791
And I hate you living here.

384
00:20:07,544 --> 00:20:09,338
- Oh, my God.
- Jeez.

385
00:20:09,546 --> 00:20:12,383
- Oh, God, I feel terrible.
- So do I.

386
00:20:12,633 --> 00:20:15,302
They were hugging by now.

387
00:20:16,637 --> 00:20:20,474
We never should have tried this.
We're not Jewish.

388
00:20:21,934 --> 00:20:25,103
Maybe Mrs. Shapiro next door
can talk us through it.

389
00:20:25,354 --> 00:20:28,190
- She's out of town.
- Oh, no.

390
00:20:29,066 --> 00:20:31,652
I'm sorry.
I never should have said what I said.

391
00:20:31,902 --> 00:20:35,322
Oh, Dad, no, I should have been
more sensitive. I am a psychiatrist.

392
00:20:35,489 --> 00:20:37,950
And you're a damned good one, too,
and I'm very proud of you.

393
00:20:38,158 --> 00:20:39,326
- Really?
- Yes.

394
00:20:39,534 --> 00:20:42,287
Oh, Dad, I didn't mean any
of the things I said.

395
00:20:42,454 --> 00:20:44,164
I love having you here.

396
00:20:44,373 --> 00:20:46,166
Well, I love being here.
I always have.

397
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:47,501
Honestly?

398
00:20:47,751 --> 00:20:50,212
Well, no, but I thought
it'd get us to the hug.

399
00:20:51,046 --> 00:20:52,172
All right, let's try.
