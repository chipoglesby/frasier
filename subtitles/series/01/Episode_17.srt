1
00:00:07,882 --> 00:00:09,952
I'm sorry, blake.

2
00:00:10,218 --> 00:00:13,176
When i told you to close your eyes
and imagine you're on an island,

3
00:00:13,471 --> 00:00:16,941
i didn't realise you were calling
from your car phone.

4
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:21,946
'that's ok, doc.
At least i know my airbags work.'

5
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:25,344
Well, i'm glad you're all right.
Thank you for your call.

6
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:29,454
Oh, look who's just
popped into the booth.

7
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:32,696
It's gil chesterton,
kacl's own food critic.

8
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:36,028
Which means it's my cue
to hit the road.

9
00:00:36,327 --> 00:00:38,841
So until tomorrow,
this is dr frasier crane

10
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:41,078
wishing you... a good day.

11
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:43,129
 

12
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:46,604
And... and good health.

13
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,394
- Hey, frasier.
- Hello, gil.

14
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:51,665
I heard you coughing on the air.

15
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:57,080
Are you coming down with something?
I got you this from rosenthal's deli.

16
00:00:57,474 --> 00:01:01,433
Chicken soup so lovingly prepared
even the chicken gets well.

17
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:04,541
That's very kind.

18
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:07,128
Of course, i'd never forget you, roz.

19
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,550
Ladyfingers soaked in rum.

20
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:12,333
Much like her own.

21
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:14,525
 

22
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:18,219
I hope this isn't the start of
that nasty flu that's going around.

23
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:22,848
If you want to take a couple of days off,
i'll cover your time slot.

24
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:26,166
- No, thank you. I'll be fine tomorrow.
- Okey-dokey.

25
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:29,771
But feel free to call me
if you change your mind.

26
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:36,915
Mmm... plump, gooey
and guaranteed to rot your teeth.

27
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:40,938
Yes. I don't like
his phoney british accent much, either.

28
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:45,352
You sure got
a bug up your mike about gil.

29
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:48,320
Nobody's that nice
unless they want something.

30
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:52,078
- He's just generous.
- He was generous to bonnie weems.

31
00:01:52,404 --> 00:01:56,317
He bought her wine asking for her
time slot while she was on vacation.

32
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:59,934
Then she was banished
to the midnight-to-4am-slot.

33
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:03,396
- He's after our time slot?
- We should watch our backs.

34
00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:06,699
Working from midnight to 4:00 am
would ruin your social life.

35
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:08,958
Those are your peak hours.

36
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:13,534
- You're just paranoid.
- No, i'm not.

37
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,032
Yes, you are. The man
just brought you chicken soup.

38
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:22,939
He'd be bribing the higher-ups.
They make the decisions.

39
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:28,303
Oh, frasier. Oh, good, it's still here.
I'm so sorry. This is your soup.

40
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:33,241
This is the lobster newburg
i bought for the station manager's cat.

41
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:38,586
I'll see you tomorrow, roz.

42
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:48,445
This is gruesome! A partly decomposed
body just washed up in puget sound.

43
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:50,833
- That's good news.
- Pardon?

44
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:53,442
Bodies don't rise
till the weather gets warmer.

45
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:57,151
You get your first floater,
and spring's just around the corner.

46
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,633
Morning.

47
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:05,405
- You sound awful!
- It's just a little bug.

48
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:10,076
But you can't go to work.
You're all pasty and clammy and pale.

49
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,034
And coming from an english person,
that's bad.

50
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:21,721
You often said,
"if you can walk, you can work."

51
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:25,425
Took an ironic twist
the day you got shot in the hip.

52
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:28,705
At least i had a real job.
Half your listeners

53
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,389
hear voices already
or talk to themselves.

54
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:34,025
If you don't show up,
who's going to notice?

55
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,831
I'm out of here.

56
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:41,802
But you really should stay home
and let me tend to you.

57
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:45,767
I'm a good nurse.
I mended my brothers' soccer injuries.

58
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:49,377
- I didn't play soccer.
- Neither did my hooligan brothers.

59
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:51,644
They got hurt
beating up drunken dutchmen.

60
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,729
 

61
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:56,895
That'll look pretty
against the glass in your booth.

62
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:03,599
- Why don't you just stay home?
- Thank you, but i am a physician.

63
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:09,511
I am the best monitor of my condition.
I'm fine. Fit as a fiddle.

64
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,462
 

65
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:18,709
I'm sick!

66
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:29,232
We're back with "restaurant beat".
I'm gil chesterton filling in for dr crane.

67
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:33,683
We're talking to louis. He's forgotten
tonight is his tenth anniversary.

68
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:37,460
Louis, i believe i've saved
your proverbial derrière.

69
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:42,726
I managed to secure you
a private booth at maximilian's.

70
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:47,147
Promise me for dessert,
you'll have the schwarzwaldkirschtorte.

71
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:51,269
- 'the what? '
- Schwarzwaldkirsch...

72
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,939
well, maybe you'd better
stick with the rainbow sherbet.

73
00:04:58,048 --> 00:05:02,041
- 'Thank you! You saved my marriage.'
- Don't thank me.

74
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:06,617
I'm only here because
our dear dr crane is home with the flu.

75
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,929
'Lf you're listening, doc,

76
00:05:09,184 --> 00:05:12,620
'all of us at kacl
want you to get better soon.'

77
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:15,690
I bet you do.

78
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:18,621
Time to check if the turkey's done.

79
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:22,421
Dad, you needn't sit with me all day.

80
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:25,814
Oh, no problem.
You need company when you're sick.

81
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:28,108
You never know when you'll croak.

82
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:34,676
Oh, boy, your temperature is up there.
101! You are a sick boy.

83
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:37,159
Thanks for reminding me.

84
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:41,379
The sickest i ever was was when they
shipped us back from korea.

85
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:46,312
I got an oriental parasite. It was building
its own pagoda in my colon.

86
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,910
Thank you, dad!

87
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:54,752
You know, you might try
some of my homeopathic tea.

88
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:59,739
It'll flush out your system
and make your hair more manageable.

89
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:03,227
- No, thanks.
- No! That wasn't the sickest i was.

90
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,998
It was when your mother and i
went to mexico.

91
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:09,877
I was real careful about the water,
but i ate some lettuce.

92
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:15,436
Next thing you know, i'm spewing
both for accuracy and distance.

93
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:20,669
I spent the night curled up on the floor
screaming, "i want to die!"

94
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:24,357
Wouldn't that have been a tragedy?
You wouldn't be here now.

95
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:30,034
Ok, i get the point.
I'll give you a little peace and quiet here.

96
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:35,301
Oh, no! One time, your mother left
the potato salad in the trunk of the car.

97
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:38,076
I'm still sick from that.

98
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:42,546
- Do you need anything else?
- Some more ginger ale, please.

99
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:45,295
- Very well.
- Oh, daphne,

100
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:49,087
make it shaved ice, not cubes, ok?

101
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:52,367
And i don't like those straws.
Can i have the bendy kind?

102
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:56,814
And the saltines, they're too salty.
I need the low-sodium.

103
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:59,920
Your wish is my command.

104
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:02,167
Hello, daphne. Is he in pain?

105
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,731
Not enough.

106
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:09,713
Frasier, i brought you something.

107
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:12,891
Niles!
Put the hanky down, for god's sake!

108
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:16,175
- It's not the plague!
- All right.

109
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:22,474
This is from marta, our maid.
It's a poultice to wear around your neck.

110
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:26,530
The recipe comes from her remote
mountain village in guatemala.

111
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:30,620
I can see why her village is remote.

112
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:35,539
Yes, it is pungent, but... it helps
many villagers live to be over 100.

113
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:38,747
Marta herself is 78. you should see her

114
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:41,033
scramble up the stairs
when maris rings!

115
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:42,894
 

116
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:46,565
- Oh, niles, would you mind?
- Of course.

117
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:54,698
Oh, hello, eddie.
For once, i'm actually glad to see you.

118
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:57,014
Here you are.

119
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,573
It's for you. It's roz?

120
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:11,423
- Hello?
- 'how do you feel? '

121
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,134
- Awful.
- I'm sorry to hear that

122
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:17,050
because you should get back here.

123
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,640
You were right about gil, frasier.
He's lobbying for our slot.

124
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:24,872
Millie in traffic overheard gil
talking to the station manager,

125
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:28,171
saying our mid-afternoon time slot
is perfect for his show

126
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:31,458
because then
everyone is making dinner plans.

127
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:36,039
I knew it! Geez!
Ok, roz, i'll be there tomorrow.

128
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:41,306
You better be. I don't trust
that greedy, finger-licking runt.

129
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:44,839
- How am i doing?
- Fabulous.

130
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,547
Ok, i'll be in tomorrow.

131
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:54,114
You can't be serious
about going in tomorrow.

132
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:59,127
Your pupils are dilated.
You have a fever.

133
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:02,807
In that condition,
you won't make it to the parking lot.

134
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:06,755
I just don't trust gil chesterton.
He's after my time slot.

135
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:10,125
Oh, niles,
will you stop it with the alcohol?

136
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:16,655
I can't let that smarmy chowhound
do my show for another day.

137
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:19,131
Anybody would be better.

138
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:23,021
Niles, would you do my show for me?

139
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:26,028
That fever is making you delusional.

140
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:29,433
When you were sick, i met with your
"fear of intimacy" group.

141
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:33,285
I wasn't sick.
They were just getting too close.

142
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:36,971
You're right. It's a bad idea.

143
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:40,713
Doing my show
requires abilities you don't possess.

144
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:43,951
You have to be able
to size up your patients quickly

145
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,765
and dispense advice
in an entertaining and insightful manner.

146
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:51,797
This pathetic attempt
at reverse psychology is beneath you.

147
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:54,647
- Then you won't do it?
- No, i will.

148
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:58,159
And better than you
ever dreamed of doing it!

149
00:10:10,402 --> 00:10:13,792
Here is the cough button
in case you need to cough.

150
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:18,710
And use this extra-iong commercial
if you need a bathroom break.

151
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:21,466
Those won't be necessary.
I have no cough reflex

152
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:24,385
and excellent bladder control.

153
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:29,618
It's true.
All the good ones are married.

154
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:36,117
You're on soon.
Your first caller is marcia.

155
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:38,138
Marcia.

156
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:41,573
"Hello, marcia, i'm listening."
That's trite.

157
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:46,719
"Hello, marcia. Tell me where it hurts."
No. "hello, marcia, i hear you."

158
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:54,051
- Good afternoon, seattle.
- Oh, yes. Hello!

159
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:58,037
This is dr niles crane filling in
for my ailing brother, frasier crane.

160
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:02,359
Although i feel qualified to fill frasier's
radio shoes, i should warn you

161
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:06,299
that while frasier is a freudian,
i am a jungian,

162
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:09,422
so there'll be no blaming mother today.

163
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:16,312
Ok, roz, who's my first caller?

164
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:19,710
Marcia. She's in love
with her husband's brother.

165
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:22,573
This day promises not to disappoint.

166
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:27,315
Hello, marcia, let's get better.

167
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:35,294
'before we get deeper
into your problem,

168
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:38,649
'why don't i give you
a little historical background.

169
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:42,543
'The psychiatrist sigmar brom,
that's b-r-o-m, no 'h',

170
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:47,260
'in the late 1950s, wrote extensively
on the problem you're facing,

171
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:52,414
'which is amazing when you realise
brom was a prominent reichian.'

172
00:11:52,796 --> 00:11:54,309
He's terrible!

173
00:11:57,425 --> 00:12:01,020
And so are you.
Your temperature's up to 103.

174
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:06,420
Let it go up to 105.
I couldn't be better. My time slot is safe.

175
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:10,769
Niles is as dry as this toast
you brought me... with the crust still on.

176
00:12:13,108 --> 00:12:17,624
- When i go back, they'll send a limo.
- I'll get you another drink.

177
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:22,060
- Was that last straw bendy enough?
- Perfect, thank you.

178
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:26,200
Oh, daphne...
daphne...

179
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:30,367
take these tissues away.
I... they hurt my nose.

180
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:34,258
I want the kind
with moisturiser in between the sheets.

181
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:38,925
The rose petals
in the humidifier are wilting.

182
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:41,731
Oh, of course. Anything you like.

183
00:12:42,012 --> 00:12:45,800
Fresh rose petals,
crustless toast, soft tissues,

184
00:12:46,141 --> 00:12:49,417
acupuncture needles
where you least expect them.

185
00:12:52,731 --> 00:12:55,643
Howard, lois,
i could counsel you all afternoon,

186
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:58,934
but we're coming to the end of our hour,
so i'll make it short.

187
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:05,107
If one of you doesn't say "i love you"
right now, you have no future together.

188
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:08,732
So which of you
has the courage to say "i love you"?

189
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:12,671
'Howard, i love you.'

190
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,234
Yes! Yes!

191
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,459
Howard, she loves you!

192
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:20,308
- What about you?
- 'uh... '

193
00:13:20,592 --> 00:13:25,347
howard, are you going to pack up
your emotional tent and walk away?

194
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:29,920
Howard? Howard, it's up to you!
Can you say it? Can you?

195
00:13:30,268 --> 00:13:32,498
Come on, howard!

196
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:35,001
'I... i love you, too, lois! '

197
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:38,629
- Yes!
- He said it! He said it!

198
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:41,537
- Niles is pretty good.
- Good?

199
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,777
The little rat is scintillating.

200
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:47,468
Why couldn't he do
what's expected of him and stink?

201
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:54,278
He's even better than gil chesterton.
They're trying to make me look bad!

202
00:13:54,668 --> 00:13:58,183
Oh, jesus. That high temperature
is making you zooey.

203
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:02,544
No, no, it's made me clear-headed!

204
00:14:02,884 --> 00:14:06,399
I must get down to that station
and reclaim what's rightfully mine.

205
00:14:06,721 --> 00:14:09,872
There will be no more filling in
by anybody!

206
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:14,813
- No way, no how, no one...! No...
- you're not going anywhere.

207
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:17,258
- Who's to stop me?
- I am.

208
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:20,561
How will you, with a cane,
stop a man in the prime of his life?

209
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,976
 

210
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:26,256
And i wasn't even leaning on my cane.

211
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:29,491
- Come on, daphne.
- He really is sick.

212
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:33,620
You want to talk sick?
1962, world's fair.

213
00:14:33,957 --> 00:14:38,587
The tilt-a-whirl was right next to
the little taste of india.

214
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:44,711
I was out sick this week
and i'd like to take this opportunity

215
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:47,565
to express my gratitude

216
00:14:47,846 --> 00:14:50,440
to gil chesterton
and to my brother niles

217
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:55,479
for doing such a great job of filling in
for me. I really appreciate it, guys.

218
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:02,565
Well, now that i'm
back to normal and feeling great

219
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,972
who's our first caller?

220
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:08,150
We have sonja from auburn
on line three.

221
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:10,725
Let's just hear what sonja has to say.

222
00:15:13,038 --> 00:15:15,074
Daphne! Daphne!

223
00:15:15,332 --> 00:15:19,291
- What is it this time?
- I had a dream! I had a dream!

224
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:21,936
They are plotting against me!

225
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:27,048
Now, now. We went over this already.
It's just your fever talking.

226
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:31,102
That's what you want me to think.
You're in league with niles.

227
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:35,504
I know about the two of you!
You pretend not to know, but you know.

228
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:39,288
- I must take my show back!
- You barely function!

229
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:43,918
Run down to the drugstore
with these prescriptions.

230
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:46,996
This will have you high as a kite!

231
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:51,990
- Only until i take a couple of these.
- I don't think you're in any...

232
00:15:52,369 --> 00:15:55,839
thank you, but the moment
i give a fig about what you think

233
00:15:56,164 --> 00:15:58,120
is the day that england produces
a great chef,

234
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:03,244
a world-class bottle of wine, and a car
that has a decent electrical system.

235
00:16:06,383 --> 00:16:11,411
Being a healthcare provider i try
to be sympathetic towards my patients,

236
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:14,763
but i have reached
the end of my tether with you!

237
00:16:15,058 --> 00:16:17,413
You are by far the most ungrateful,

238
00:16:17,686 --> 00:16:20,154
disagreeable,
self-centred, whiny fusspot

239
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:22,793
i've had the misfortune of dealing with!

240
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:27,662
I've had patients on their deathbeds
who were more considerate and jolly!

241
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:31,066
As far as i'm concerned,
you can lay in those sweaty sheets

242
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:33,834
till you're one giant bedsore!

243
00:16:35,537 --> 00:16:38,449
- Are you done?
- Yes.

244
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:42,946
Then scurry on down to the drugstore.
Get those filled while i get dressed.

245
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:54,105
Oh, hello, frasier!
What a surprise to see you here today!

246
00:16:54,431 --> 00:16:58,629
It's no wonder. I've taken
some wonder drugs. I feel wonderful!

247
00:16:58,977 --> 00:17:02,856
So, i'm going to go do my show now
so ta-ta, pie man.

248
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:09,029
Thank you, greta.
It's satisfying to change someone's life.

249
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:13,708
Look who's wandered into my booth.
My brother, frasier.

250
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:18,232
Hello. I've come to take the reins
of my show, so scoot out of there.

251
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:20,775
This is a good time for a commercial.

252
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:23,680
This is dr niles crane. Let's get better.

253
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,554
You ok? Your eyes look a little glassy.

254
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:31,389
I'm fine. The drugs i took
have some minor slide effects.

255
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:36,041
Frasier, look at me.
Do you see trails when i do this?

256
00:17:37,849 --> 00:17:39,760
Whoa!

257
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:42,054
Wasn't doing that before!

258
00:17:42,312 --> 00:17:45,543
You're not going on the air like this.
Stop it! St... st...

259
00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:53,300
you're going to go to bed,
rest and get rid of this fever

260
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:56,693
so you can be as good as new.
Let's get better.

261
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:00,383
All right?

262
00:18:00,622 --> 00:18:04,854
- All right?
- All right. Ok.

263
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:09,362
Maybe you can help me
find someone to drive me home.

264
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:12,751
That's the most sensible thing
you've said so far.

265
00:18:13,051 --> 00:18:15,804
Frasier! Frasier!

266
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:27,460
Hello, seattle, i'm back.

267
00:18:27,732 --> 00:18:31,930
This is dr frasier crane.
I promise i will never leave you again.

268
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:35,475
So, let's take our first caller.

269
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:37,818
Hello, i'm listening.

270
00:18:38,076 --> 00:18:40,067
'Hi, dr crane.

271
00:18:40,328 --> 00:18:42,284
'Thanks for taking my call.

272
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:45,531
'I'm a bit nervous, ok?
My name is robert.'

273
00:18:45,834 --> 00:18:47,870
And your name is...?

274
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:52,082
'My name is robert.'

275
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:56,174
I'm sorry, we've already had
a robert today. Goodbye.

276
00:18:57,971 --> 00:19:00,565
It's roz.
Could you get security up here?

277
00:19:00,849 --> 00:19:04,888
Captain kirk's got control of the bridge,
and he's gone insane.

278
00:19:05,395 --> 00:19:07,704
- Who is this?
- 'i'm janice.'

279
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:10,176
What's your problem?

280
00:19:10,442 --> 00:19:14,117
'I'm having a problem breaking
through a barrier with my in-laws.'

281
00:19:14,446 --> 00:19:16,198
Boring!

282
00:19:20,035 --> 00:19:23,072
Hello, you're on the crane
with frasier air.

283
00:19:24,331 --> 00:19:27,004
'Hi, dr crane, this is marjorie.

284
00:19:27,292 --> 00:19:30,045
'I'm having a problem with my boss.

285
00:19:30,337 --> 00:19:34,410
'He doesn't respect me, and i don't
have the courage to confront him.'

286
00:19:34,758 --> 00:19:39,309
Ok, marjorie. Well, let's see.
Let's do a little role-playing.

287
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,829
I'll be your boss, you be yourself.

288
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:46,011
Come in and talk to me in a forceful
way, and tell me what you think.

289
00:19:46,353 --> 00:19:50,551
- You may be surprised.
- 'Well, ok.

290
00:19:50,899 --> 00:19:53,857
'Listen, mr ross, i've worked here

291
00:19:54,152 --> 00:19:56,985
'for six years
and i've never missed a day,

292
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:02,832
'but you've constantly promoted people
less qualified than i am. That's not fair.'

293
00:20:03,244 --> 00:20:07,715
Oh, well, marjorie,
i must say i admire your forthrightness.

294
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:13,635
I wish the others spoke to me with
an open mind. You'll get that promotion.

295
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:16,163
- 'Hey, that was great! '
- Wasn't it?

296
00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:19,382
Ok, it's my turn.
I'm marjorie, you're the boss now.

297
00:20:19,678 --> 00:20:21,669
Come on!

298
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,944
These nice men will take you home.

299
00:20:25,225 --> 00:20:28,342
I'm... i'm doing my show. I can't.

300
00:20:28,645 --> 00:20:30,761
- I'm on the air.
- No. You're on commercial.

301
00:20:31,022 --> 00:20:35,095
Don't you worry your mucus-filled head.
Everything's under control.

302
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:38,241
- This is my show!
- Hey, this is fun.

303
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:41,647
Make it go faster! Whee!

304
00:20:43,076 --> 00:20:45,829
- Five seconds, niles!
- All right.

305
00:20:48,206 --> 00:20:51,482
This is dr niles crane.
We haven't taken leave of our senses.

306
00:20:51,793 --> 00:20:55,786
That bit of inspired lunacy
was just a little docudrama

307
00:20:56,131 --> 00:21:00,090
frasier and i put together
on the dangers of overmedication.

308
00:21:06,016 --> 00:21:10,885
Bravo, frasier, for so brilliantly
demonstrating why they call it "dope".

309
00:21:13,523 --> 00:21:15,753
Daphne! Daphne!

310
00:21:16,026 --> 00:21:17,903
What?

311
00:21:18,153 --> 00:21:21,828
I had another dream. I dreamt i went
to the station all doped up

312
00:21:22,157 --> 00:21:24,910
and made a big fool of myself!

313
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:28,034
They dragged me out of there
like some lunatic.

314
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:32,118
Now, now. That was just a dream.
You go back to sleep.

315
00:21:32,459 --> 00:21:35,895
- You'll feel better in the morning.
- Ok. Ah...

316
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:40,091
oh, daphne...
could i have a little lemonade?

317
00:21:40,425 --> 00:21:42,575
With lemons and a sprig of mint.

318
00:21:42,844 --> 00:21:46,393
Anything you want.

319
00:21:46,723 --> 00:21:52,002
- Why'd you tell him it was a dream?
- No fun telling him the truth now.

320
00:21:52,395 --> 00:21:56,434
I'll wait till tomorrow morning
when he's good and lucid.

321
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:09,022
# Hey, baby, i hear the blues a-calling
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

322
00:22:10,121 --> 00:22:11,759
# oh, my!

323
00:22:11,998 --> 00:22:17,834
# And maybe i seem a bit confused
yeah, maybe... but i got you pegged!

324
00:22:19,214 --> 00:22:22,843
# But i don't know what to do with those
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

325
00:22:26,054 --> 00:22:28,409
# they're calling again

326
00:22:28,932 --> 00:22:33,608
# scrambled eggs all over my face
what is a boy to do? #

327
00:22:35,605 --> 00:22:37,914
frasier has left the building.
