1
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:11,269
I would like to depart
from my usual format

2
00:00:11,594 --> 00:00:13,630
because i read a book that...

3
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:17,324
it truly just knocked
my mental socks off.

4
00:00:17,642 --> 00:00:19,951
It's called "the menopausal male".

5
00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:23,618
Its author, the psychiatric scholar
dr helmut bruga,

6
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:28,297
has agreed to join us today from
the university of washington.

7
00:00:28,653 --> 00:00:34,603
Dr bruga, guten tag. I've been an
admirer of yours for a long time.

8
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:37,549
'i enjoy your show as well.'

9
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:38,818
Really?

10
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:43,032
'Yes. Though i do not in most cases
agree with your analysis.'

11
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:45,332
Back to your book.

12
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:51,089
We're familiar with the changes that
occur in the female menopause, but...

13
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:55,746
'excuse me, dr crane.
May i say hello to roz? '

14
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,414
Yes, of course.

15
00:00:58,641 --> 00:01:02,429
- 'Hello, roz.'
- Hello, dr bruga.

16
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:07,481
Your research indicates that
the reproductive imperative

17
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:09,895
is reawakened
in later life when a man is...

18
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:13,031
'you have a very sensuous voice.'

19
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:17,247
Thank you.

20
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:20,884
- 'Not you. Roz.'
- Yes, well, back to male menopause...

21
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:24,835
'would you like to go to a movie,
maybe grab a bite? '

22
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:27,728
Well, that would be very...

23
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:30,074
no, thank you very much.

24
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:35,334
Thank you for joining us, dr bruga,
and for so vividly proving your point.

25
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:39,793
- 'You will give roz my number? '
- Oh, i think roz has your number.

26
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:46,326
 

27
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:53,416
- Oh, hello, dr crane.
- Hello, daphne. Is this a bad time?

28
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:56,775
Your brother isn't home,
your father's out walking eddie.

29
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:59,430
Oh, darn the luck.

30
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:03,001
I stopped by to drop off
this necklace for maris.

31
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:05,200
I'll hide it here till her birthday.

32
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:08,848
- I'm sure it will be fine. Mind if i peek?
- Not at all.

33
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:12,525
Oh!

34
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:17,862
My! Emeralds!
Your practice must be doing well.

35
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:22,055
Who'd have thought the mentally
disturbed had this much money?

36
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:28,695
- Would you like to try it on?
- Oh, yes! Wouldn't mrs crane mind?

37
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:31,260
No. Maris is the soul of generosity.

38
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:37,078
Just last week, she donated all her old
cocktail dresses to a homeless shelter.

39
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:42,617
Oh, let me just
get my hair out of the way.

40
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:44,664
Oh! Oh, my!

41
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:47,303
- Can you see them?
- Oh, yes, thank you.

42
00:02:56,384 --> 00:03:00,502
Hello, niles.
Whatever are you doing here?

43
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:06,365
I bought an emerald necklace for maris,
and i needed someplace to hide it.

44
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:12,745
Emeralds? Well, may i see it?

45
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:15,256
Not at the moment, no.

46
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:20,075
- Why not?
- It's down me blouse.

47
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:25,038
I see. Well, i'm sure maris will
never think of looking for it there.

48
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:31,055
It slipped down there
when i was trying it on. I'll go extract it.

49
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:33,917
Just call me butterfingers.

50
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:36,925
Join a health club, niles.

51
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:40,591
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, dad.

52
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:44,758
- Niles, what brings you by?
- I'm hiding maris' birthday gift.

53
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:49,378
Oh, it's that time again.
I guess i'll have to get her something.

54
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:52,448
Too bad.
I just got back from the hardware store.

55
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:55,121
I saw a great ratchet set.

56
00:03:56,444 --> 00:04:00,517
As if there's anything left on her
that needs tightening.

57
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:11,088
- Oh, dad, no, not more duct tape!
- Yeah...

58
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:16,173
i got to repair a little split
in the old throne here.

59
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:21,462
Got to catch these rips early,
or they look like hell.

60
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:28,534
- Why don't i bring the eames here?
- Oh, no.

61
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:31,646
I need a comfortable place
for my fanny.

62
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:35,248
- how about florida?
- I heard that.

63
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:40,314
I put all this care
into decorating my home,

64
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:43,286
only to have it mocked by this atrocity.

65
00:04:43,575 --> 00:04:47,011
It is your home. Why don't you
just make him get rid of it?

66
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:50,764
It's not so simple. One would
have to find the right moment.

67
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:53,994
One should consider dad's feelings.

68
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:58,128
- He is attached to this little chair.
- You're afraid to stand up to him!

69
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:00,899
Oh, like you're not!

70
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:04,486
At least i don't have to
live with something unattractive.

71
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:15,535
I'm just having some fun with you.
I think maris is rather attractive

72
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:18,618
in a minimalist sort of way.

73
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:21,894
Oh, forget it.
I'm just upset about the chair.

74
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:28,291
There's a sound psychological basis
for getting rid of this chair.

75
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:31,653
- Oh, really? Enlighten me, doctor.
- With pleasure.

76
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:36,552
Originally, dad needed it to bridge
the transition from his old apartment.

77
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,832
But, as with all transitional objects,
be they a teddy bear,

78
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:42,884
be they a thumb, be they a blanky...

79
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,929
stop saying "be they"!

80
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:49,054
The point is,
there comes a time when you must

81
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:52,307
put these security objects aside
and reassert your independence.

82
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:57,312
Yes, of course. So you're saying that
if i should go down to the store,

83
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:02,287
buy dad a new chair and throw
this one away, i'd be doing it for him?

84
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:07,011
It would be a payback for when he used
your blanky to clean his revolver.

85
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:11,462
Oops, i'm sorry. Our time is up.

86
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:35,149
Dear god, frasier, we've stumbled
upon hell's waiting room.

87
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:41,398
This is not for the faint of heart.
We're treading a thin line here.

88
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:45,853
We need something that complements
my decor and pleases dad.

89
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:51,510
Oh, dear god! How could anyone have
something like that in their living room?

90
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:54,345
It looks like
it's upholstered in golf pants.

91
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:56,817
Perhaps you could help us?

92
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,039
- Perhaps.
- We need a chair.

93
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:01,888
- We got 'em.
- Wait.

94
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:05,005
We'd like one with
the presence of a mies van der rohe,

95
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,860
and the insouciance of a le corbusier.

96
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:10,889
This one vibrates.

97
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:15,220
Perhaps you could direct us to
your recliners, preferably one in suede.

98
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,791
People seem to like this lazy guy.

99
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:24,297
What do they call the deluxe model:
The hopeless slackass?

100
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:32,176
Oh, hey!
What about this one over here?

101
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:35,725
That would not look
altogether hideous in my living room.

102
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:38,234
Have a seat.
It's got swedish massage.

103
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,298
- No, thanks.
- No, no. Go ahead. Try it out.

104
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:44,544
- I'll fire it up for you.
- That won't be necessary.

105
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:47,512
I like to sit in my chair, not vibrate.

106
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:50,395
Thank you any... oh! Ooh!

107
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:56,359
- It also has shiatsu.
- Ohh...

108
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:02,187
i never knew a chair
could be this satisfying.

109
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:08,393
I never knew anything could.
I want it!

110
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:11,206
I'm sure it would fit in
with maris' antiques?!

111
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:15,723
Then i'll just rent it an apartment
and visit it on the side.

112
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:21,168
Why don't you have a try yourself?

113
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:24,257
No. You see,
i'm buying it for my father...

114
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:27,618
- you must sit in it.
- Who knows other people's tastes?

115
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:30,563
Something seems wrong...
turn on this.

116
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:34,757
Ohh... oh, mommy!

117
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,475
 

118
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:44,649
Eddie! What is the matter with him?

119
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:47,296
He saw your father's chair was gone.

120
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:50,641
He's afraid your father's gone too.
He suspects foul play.

121
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:55,941
Stop it! If i'd stuck dad's feet in cement
and thrown him into puget sound,

122
00:08:56,286 --> 00:09:00,245
you would have been
the tiny little splash that followed him!

123
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:02,652
 

124
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:06,273
Oh, that must be leo!
Wait till you see this!

125
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:09,765
- Make way.
- Just be careful.

126
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,006
Watch the furniture and the walls.

127
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,969
Excuse me, but i'm a professional.
I take pride in my work...

128
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:21,349
how did that get there? At least
i didn't lose my licence this time.

129
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:24,120
- Quickly!
- I'm sure beavis

130
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,353
will start to wonder where you are.

131
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:33,831
Leo, we're having a problem
with a leaky faucet in the sink.

132
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:37,274
- Where would that be?
- In the kitchen, dear.

133
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:40,410
That wasn't a dumb question.
You got bathrooms too.

134
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:43,458
None that you'll be going
anywhere near.

135
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,661
It's lovely!

136
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:48,956
I thought the other one was nice,
but this is smashing!

137
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:52,645
Try it out.
And it has a little surprise.

138
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:55,401
Ooh. This is comfy.

139
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:58,796
Although it's a little on the soft side.

140
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:00,851
I prefer...

141
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:04,847
hello.

142
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:07,824
Ohh... ohh... ohh...

143
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:10,064
this is enough
to make me give up me search

144
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:12,309
for a meaningful relationship.

145
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:15,880
Oh, quick! Dad! Get out!

146
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:18,307
Oh, all right! Just like a man!

147
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:21,693
Now you've had your fun,
you don't care where i am!

148
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:29,884
- Hey there.
- Hi, dad. I've got a surprise for you.

149
00:10:31,506 --> 00:10:34,737
- What's that?
- It's your new easy chair!

150
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:39,442
Well, what do you know about that?

151
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:43,040
- Where's my old chair?
- In the storage space. Try this.

152
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:45,501
Look, i appreciate this, frasier,

153
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,920
but that... it really isn't me.

154
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:53,217
Dad, you haven't even sat in it yet.
Come on down, martin crane.

155
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:05,577
That's disgusting!

156
00:11:08,043 --> 00:11:14,039
I'm sorry, but i'm a creature of habit.
I think i'd rather have my old chair back.

157
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:18,345
But why? This chair is a lot more
comfortable and it's therapeutic.

158
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:21,192
I know, i just never cared for leather.

159
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:24,431
You stick to it in hot weather,
you can't sit in it in shorts.

160
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:27,604
It makes my back sweat. Black's hot.

161
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:30,615
I'm sorry, i just couldn't get used to it.

162
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:35,927
All right. The important thing is that you
lived with it for a full 15 seconds. Leo!

163
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:40,439
Leo, bring mr crane's chair back.

164
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:43,859
- Sorry, fish 'n' chips. Someone took it.
- What?

165
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:47,791
Someone broke into my storage space
and stole the chair?

166
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:51,480
- Storage space?
- That's where i told you to put it!

167
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:54,025
Not another day like last tuesday.

168
00:11:55,924 --> 00:11:58,882
- Where is it?
- It was snagged from the dumpster.

169
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:03,295
- I almost kept it myself.
- You threw it away! You happy now?

170
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,757
You have to find it.
I don't care what you have to do.

171
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:10,496
- Just find the chair!
- "Dump the chair, get the chair."

172
00:12:10,814 --> 00:12:12,770
- Am i the building lackey?
- Yes!

173
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:14,776
Oh, ok.

174
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:22,769
Well, if no one's going to want this,
we could put it in my room.

175
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:28,779
Maybe later. You two talk it over.

176
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:33,314
You've been trying to get rid of it
from the day i moved in!

177
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:37,299
You could at least show
a little gratitude. I did this for you.

178
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:40,430
- Like hell!
- You think i lost it on purpose?

179
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:44,314
Let me tell you something.
That chair was the only thing

180
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,393
that made me feel comfortable,
like maybe this was my home too.

181
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:52,163
Ever since you got here,
i've tried to make you comfortable.

182
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,994
But why?
Everybody knows martin crane

183
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:57,550
doesn't like calfskin!
He prefers duct tape!

184
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:02,585
And food crumbs!

185
00:13:02,866 --> 00:13:07,894
There we are. And let's have a dribble
of beer while we're at it! Delightful!

186
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:12,964
Let's not forget, to top it all off,
just the slightest bit of dog hair, hmm?

187
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,773
I suppose you'll throw eddie out next?

188
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:24,248
We're talking about
a 25-year-old broken-down chair!

189
00:13:24,596 --> 00:13:27,588
If you don't like this chair,
i'll get you any one you want!

190
00:13:27,891 --> 00:13:30,769
All right, i'll tell you what chair i want.

191
00:13:31,061 --> 00:13:35,054
The chair i was in
when armstrong walked on the moon

192
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:38,196
and when the us hockey team
beat the russians.

193
00:13:39,611 --> 00:13:43,047
The one i was in when you called me
to say i had a grandson.

194
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:47,714
The one i was in all those nights
when your mother used to

195
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:51,108
wake me up with a kiss
after i'd fallen asleep in front of the tv.

196
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:53,803
I still fall asleep in it.

197
00:13:54,084 --> 00:13:56,917
Every once in a while when i wake up,

198
00:13:57,212 --> 00:14:00,921
i still expect your mother
to be there to lead me off to bed.

199
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:08,003
Oh, never mind. It's only a chair.

200
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:11,882
Come on, eddie.

201
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:18,623
- How was your weekend?
- Hellish.

202
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,175
Let me tell you what happened to me.

203
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:25,357
I had the most incredible date saturday!
It was really hot!

204
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:27,769
- Sunday, i'm driving home...
- sunday?

205
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:30,025
I told you it was hot.

206
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:32,846
My car breaks down
in front of a church,

207
00:14:33,123 --> 00:14:35,159
people are coming out after the show...

208
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:36,816
- service.
- What?

209
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:39,398
Churches have services.

210
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:42,265
- Can i finish my story?
- All right.

211
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:45,188
Thank you.
So, i walk up to the minister.

212
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:47,424
I ask him if i can use his phone,

213
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:50,637
and he tells me
my sweater's on inside out.

214
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:55,122
We have a date tonight.
Ministers aren't celibate, are they?

215
00:14:56,855 --> 00:14:59,323
Not that i don't love a challenge.

216
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:06,016
Maybe you should take a sick day,
call into the show yourself.

217
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:09,709
You're on the air.

218
00:15:09,993 --> 00:15:12,746
Good afternoon.
This is dr frasier crane.

219
00:15:13,038 --> 00:15:17,270
Before i take my first caller,
i'd like to make a personal appeal.

220
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:22,904
Saturday, my father's chair was taken
from outside the elliot bay towers.

221
00:15:23,298 --> 00:15:28,088
It's a runny, split-pea green
and mud-brown striped recliner

222
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:34,227
with some stuffing popping out
from underneath a strip of duct tape.

223
00:15:36,061 --> 00:15:41,089
I'm offering a handsome reward
for its safe return. Thank you.

224
00:15:41,483 --> 00:15:43,872
- Who's on line one?
- It's john...

225
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:48,191
so remember, stephanie, a little
emotional flexibility is a good thing.

226
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:51,489
Just as the mighty oak
snaps and falls in a windstorm,

227
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:56,495
so the weeping willow bends
and lives to see another day.

228
00:15:56,873 --> 00:16:00,707
Thank you.
So, any update on the chair?

229
00:16:01,044 --> 00:16:04,673
- The calls have been pouring in.
- Really? What are they?

230
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:09,443
Spotted at the top of the space needle,
in the governor's mansion...

231
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:12,078
one man saw it flying over his house,

232
00:16:12,347 --> 00:16:15,100
but thought
it was just a tacky spaceship.

233
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:20,886
Funny stuff, people.
Let's just go to commercial break

234
00:16:21,189 --> 00:16:25,102
so you all can chuckle through
these words from yukon lumber.

235
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,397
Ingrates!

236
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:32,045
I clear away their psychic debris,
and this is how they repay me.

237
00:16:32,367 --> 00:16:36,326
Uh-huh. I got it. He'll be there
after the show. Thank you.

238
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:39,257
- I found the chair!
- Oh, thank god!

239
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:41,532
By tonight, my dad will be safely back

240
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:44,830
in his beer-stained,
flea-infested, duct-taped recliner,

241
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:48,805
adjusting his shorts and
cheering on jean-claude van damme.

242
00:16:50,802 --> 00:16:55,557
Yes, it's quite a little piece of heaven
i've carved out for myself.

243
00:16:56,266 --> 00:16:58,018
 

244
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:08,024
Ok, ok, that was nice.

245
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,958
Er, but let's just remember,

246
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:14,675
there is a fine line between
good acting and hamming it up.

247
00:17:14,993 --> 00:17:17,268
- Let's try again.
- Excuse me...

248
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:20,768
- i can't find my moustache.
- I can't remember any of my lines.

249
00:17:21,082 --> 00:17:23,676
- I'm really nervous.
- Me too.

250
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:27,555
- Can you all come here for a second?
- Mrs warren?

251
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:37,175
This isn't broadway, it's junior high.
No reason at all to be nervous.

252
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:42,472
We'll go out there tonight in front of
family and friends and have fun, ok?

253
00:17:42,854 --> 00:17:45,493
- Ok!
- If one more thing goes wrong,

254
00:17:45,774 --> 00:17:48,129
i'll have to take my own life.

255
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:52,296
- If i could have a word with you.
- Sorry.

256
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:55,723
In 45 minutes, a shaky production
of "ten little indians" starts.

257
00:17:56,034 --> 00:18:00,949
Oh. I recognised the mise en scène.
I did this play years ago.

258
00:18:01,331 --> 00:18:03,083
"On the contrary,

259
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:05,801
"many a psychotic killer
appears to be quite normal.

260
00:18:06,086 --> 00:18:09,965
"You can never suspect
that underneath that calm exterior

261
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:13,847
"there lies the heart
of a maniac. Ha-ha."

262
00:18:14,177 --> 00:18:16,293
It happens to be true, by the way.

263
00:18:18,181 --> 00:18:21,491
- Who are you?
- Oh, i'm dr frasier crane.

264
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:25,650
From the radio. Kacl talk...
never mind.

265
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:28,328
I was told my chair would be here.

266
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:31,281
I'll just get this out of your hair,
if i may.

267
00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:36,643
Excuse me. Right now this chair's
the most entertaining thing on stage.

268
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:40,503
- That's true, but...
- ow! Ah!

269
00:18:40,829 --> 00:18:45,903
Just run along to the nurse's office.
They'll have you back here soon.

270
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:48,647
I am so sick of being positive.

271
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:53,072
This chair belongs to my father,
and i must return it to him.

272
00:18:53,425 --> 00:18:57,134
Sir, you can have it back in two weeks.

273
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,426
I'm in a difficult position.

274
00:18:59,681 --> 00:19:02,514
Difficult? You want difficult?

275
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:08,281
I have a rickety set, a leading man
whose voice changed at 3:00 pm today,

276
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:11,523
and my name
is spelt wrong in the programme!

277
00:19:13,528 --> 00:19:19,398
See what i did there? That's the kind
of anger i want in the accusation scene.

278
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:22,784
- I'll give you $200 for a new chair.
- Forget it.

279
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:26,754
Mrs warren, i am speaking
to you now from the heart.

280
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:30,359
By putting this chair into the trash,
i have wounded my father.

281
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:34,265
It's just a chair to you. To him,
it is a treasure trove of memories.

282
00:19:34,591 --> 00:19:38,789
I thoughtlessly discarded it
because i didn't like it in my living room!

283
00:19:39,137 --> 00:19:42,095
I have sacrificed
heart and soul for form and function!

284
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,346
I am ashamed for that!

285
00:19:44,601 --> 00:19:46,557
This chair is the last chance

286
00:19:46,811 --> 00:19:50,645
to forge a meaningful relationship
with the only father i'll ever have!

287
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,318
People, were you all listening to that?

288
00:19:56,613 --> 00:19:59,286
Because you can learn
a lot from this man.

289
00:19:59,574 --> 00:20:03,169
That speech he just gave
is a perfect example

290
00:20:03,495 --> 00:20:07,204
of the kind of hammy overacting
i don't want to see out of you.

291
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,735
- Hold on!
- Mrs warren!

292
00:20:10,001 --> 00:20:12,117
Bobby just threw up backstage!

293
00:20:12,379 --> 00:20:15,610
Perfect. My dr armstrong
has opening-night jitters.

294
00:20:15,924 --> 00:20:19,155
No, it's stomach flu.
He's in the nurse's office.

295
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:23,223
You'll have to cancel the performance.
Too bad. I'll just take this.

296
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:26,946
I can't cancel.
I have 300 parents in their cars already.

297
00:20:27,268 --> 00:20:29,498
The american theatre will survive.

298
00:20:29,771 --> 00:20:34,083
You can't do the show without
dr armstrong. That's the part i played.

00:20:36,027 --> 00:20:40,464
- You played dr armstrong?
- Well, yes... oh, no. You're not...

300
00:20:40,824 --> 00:20:42,974
how badly do you want your chair?

301
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:45,473
I'm sorry. It's out of the question!

302
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:48,976
You know, it would be
a real shame if something...

303
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:52,441
oh! ...happened to this chair.

304
00:20:54,212 --> 00:20:57,284
But it's been years!
I hardly can remember any of the lines!

305
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:00,150
Then you'll fit right in.

306
00:21:03,555 --> 00:21:05,307
 

307
00:21:15,942 --> 00:21:17,933
 

308
00:21:29,372 --> 00:21:33,490
# Baby, i hear the blues a-calling
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

309
00:21:34,544 --> 00:21:36,182
# oh, my!

310
00:21:36,421 --> 00:21:42,178
# And maybe i seem a bit confused
yeah, maybe... but i got you pegged!

311
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:49,154
# But i don't know what to do with those
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

312
00:21:50,477 --> 00:21:52,786
# they're calling again

313
00:21:53,313 --> 00:21:57,989
# scrambled eggs all over my face
what is a boy to do? #

314
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:01,268
thank you!
