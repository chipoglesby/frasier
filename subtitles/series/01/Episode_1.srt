1
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:11,220
Listen to yourself, Bob!

2
00:00:11,221 --> 00:00:15,284
You follow her to work, you eavesdrop on her calls, you open her mail

3
00:00:15,285 --> 00:00:18,994
The minute you started doing these things, the relationship was over!

4
00:00:19,574 --> 00:00:20,720
Thank you for your call.

5
00:00:23,487 --> 00:00:25,282
Roz, I think we have time for one more?

6
00:00:25,283 --> 00:00:26,571
Yes, Dr Crane.

7
00:00:26,572 --> 00:00:29,231
On line four, we have Russell from Kirkland

8
00:00:30,212 --> 00:00:33,772
Hello, Russell. This is Dr. Frasier Crane; I'm listening

9
00:00:33,773 --> 00:00:38,171
Well, I've been feeling sort of, uh, you know, depressed lately.

10
00:00:39,089 --> 00:00:41,693
My life's not going anywhere, er,

11
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:44,522
It's not that bad. It's just...

12
00:00:44,523 --> 00:00:46,384
the same old apartment, same old job...

13
00:00:46,385 --> 00:00:49,368
- sometimes it just
- Er, Russell, we're just about at the end of our hour.

14
00:00:49,936 --> 00:00:53,881
Let me see if I can cut to the chase by using  myself as an example.

15
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:57,380
Six months ago, I was living in Boston.

16
00:00:58,051 --> 00:01:01,387
My wife had left me, which was very painful.

17
00:01:01,747 --> 00:01:04,326
Then she came back to me, which was excruciating.

18
00:01:10,078 --> 00:01:14,915
On top of that, my practice had grown stagnant, and my social life consisted of...

19
00:01:16,063 --> 00:01:18,502
hanging around a bar night after night.

20
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:23,218
You see, I was clinging to a life that wasn't working anymore

21
00:01:23,219 --> 00:01:25,948
and I knew I had to do something, anything.

22
00:01:25,949 --> 00:01:27,774
So, I ended the marriage once and for all,

23
00:01:27,775 --> 00:01:31,145
packed up my things, and moved back here to my hometown of Seattle

24
00:01:31,146 --> 00:01:32,414
Go Seahawks!

25
00:01:33,518 --> 00:01:35,185
I took action, Russell.

26
00:01:35,444 --> 00:01:36,572
And you can, too.

27
00:01:36,573 --> 00:01:39,081
Move, change, do something,

28
00:01:39,082 --> 00:01:41,266
if it's a mistake, do something else.

29
00:01:41,955 --> 00:01:43,230
Will you do that, Russell?

30
00:01:45,015 --> 00:01:46,090
Will you?

31
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,080
Russell...?

32
00:01:48,941 --> 00:01:49,948
I think we lost him.

33
00:01:50,297 --> 00:01:52,764
No, we cut to the news thirty seconds ago.

34
00:01:56,308 --> 00:01:57,694
Oh, for crying out loud!

35
00:01:58,611 --> 00:02:00,463
I finally bare my soul to all of Seattle,

36
00:02:00,464 --> 00:02:03,132
and they're listening to Chopper Dave's "Rush-Hour Round-Up!"

37
00:02:05,843 --> 00:02:07,418
Well, the rest of the show was pretty good.

38
00:02:09,215 --> 00:02:10,929
It was a, a good show, wasn't it?

39
00:02:11,217 --> 00:02:12,788
Here, your brother called.

40
00:02:13,381 --> 00:02:15,205
Roz, in the trade we call that "avoidance".

41
00:02:15,206 --> 00:02:17,326
Don't change the subject, tell me what you think.

42
00:02:17,427 --> 00:02:19,292
Did I ever tell you what this little button does?

43
00:02:20,043 --> 00:02:22,154
I am not a piece of Lalique.

44
00:02:22,155 --> 00:02:23,554
I can handle criticism.

45
00:02:23,555 --> 00:02:24,876
How was I today?

46
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:26,232
Let's see...

47
00:02:27,141 --> 00:02:28,341
you dropped two commercials

48
00:02:28,342 --> 00:02:30,751
you left a total of twenty-eight seconds of dead air,

49
00:02:30,752 --> 00:02:32,677
you scrambled the station's call letters,

50
00:02:32,678 --> 00:02:33,988
you spilled yogurt on the control board,

51
00:02:33,989 --> 00:02:35,299
and you kept referring to Jerry,

52
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,617
with the identity crisis

53
00:02:36,618 --> 00:02:37,800
as "Jeff".

54
00:02:43,795 --> 00:02:45,437
- You say my brother called...
- Mmm, hmm

55
00:02:51,097 --> 00:02:52,030
So I said to the gardener

56
00:02:52,031 --> 00:02:55,222
"Yoshi, I do not want a Zen garden in my backyard.

57
00:02:55,658 --> 00:02:58,269
If I want to rake gravel every ten minutes to maintain my inner harmony,

58
00:02:58,270 --> 00:02:59,476
I'll move to Yokohama."

59
00:03:01,437 --> 00:03:05,278
Well, this offends him, so he starts pulling up  Maris' prized Camellias by the handful.

60
00:03:05,279 --> 00:03:06,780
Well, I coundn't stand for that,

61
00:03:06,781 --> 00:03:10,736
so I marched right into the morning room and locked the door until he cooled down.

62
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:15,362
Tell me you would have handled it differently, Frasier.

63
00:03:16,857 --> 00:03:17,846
Oh, I'm sorry, Niles

64
00:03:17,847 --> 00:03:19,407
I didn't realise you'd stopped talking

65
00:03:20,876 --> 00:03:22,458
You haven't heard a word I said.

66
00:03:22,459 --> 00:03:23,667
Oh Niles, you're a psychiatrist

67
00:03:23,668 --> 00:03:27,466
you know what it's like to listen to people prattling on endlessly about their mundane lives.

68
00:03:28,183 --> 00:03:28,949
Touché

69
00:03:29,358 --> 00:03:31,400
And on that subject, I heard your show today.

70
00:03:37,631 --> 00:03:38,753
And?

71
00:03:38,754 --> 00:03:40,687
You know what I think about pop psychiatry

72
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:42,409
Yes, I know what you think about everything.

73
00:03:43,015 --> 00:03:45,547
When was the last time you had an unexpressed thought?

74
00:03:45,548 --> 00:03:46,548
I'm having one now.

75
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:51,838
- You guys ready?
- Two café latte supremos

76
00:04:00,549 --> 00:04:01,326
No, thank you

77
00:04:03,923 --> 00:04:06,810
So, Frasier, How are you doing on your own?

78
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:08,929
I'm fine.

79
00:04:09,634 --> 00:04:10,755
I love my new life.

80
00:04:11,249 --> 00:04:12,795
I love the solitude.

81
00:04:13,051 --> 00:04:14,644
I miss Frederick like the dickens, of course.

82
00:04:15,119 --> 00:04:16,042
You know, he's quite a boy.

83
00:04:16,043 --> 00:04:19,189
He's playing goalie on the peewee soccer team now.

84
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:20,887
Ha, he's a chip off the old block!

85
00:04:22,163 --> 00:04:23,793
- You hated sports.
- So does he!

86
00:04:26,682 --> 00:04:28,212
The fresh air's good for him.

87
00:04:29,527 --> 00:04:31,644
Oh well, this has been fun, Frasier, but...

88
00:04:33,145 --> 00:04:35,376
we have a problem, and that's why I thought we should talk.

89
00:04:35,644 --> 00:04:36,669
Is it Dad?

90
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:37,389
Afraid so.

91
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:40,409
One of his buddies from the police force called this morning.

92
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:43,071
He went over to see him, and found him on the bathroom floor.

93
00:04:43,072 --> 00:04:45,082
- Oh, my God!
- No, it's okay, he's fine.

94
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,000
What, his hip again?

95
00:04:47,927 --> 00:04:50,450
Frasier, I don't think he can live alone anymore.

96
00:04:52,098 --> 00:04:53,077
What can we do?

97
00:04:53,763 --> 00:04:56,957
Well, I know this isn't going to be anyone's favourite solution,

98
00:04:56,958 --> 00:05:01,225
but I took the liberty of checking out a few convalescent homes for him.

99
00:05:01,226 --> 00:05:03,787
Oh Niles, a home? He's still a young man!

100
00:05:03,788 --> 00:05:06,075
Well, you certainly can't take care of him

101
00:05:06,076 --> 00:05:07,756
you're just getting your new life together.

102
00:05:07,757 --> 00:05:11,052
Absolutely. Besides, we were never simpatico.

103
00:05:11,701 --> 00:05:13,576
Of course, I can't take care of him.

104
00:05:13,577 --> 00:05:15,027
Oh yes, yes, of course, of course...

105
00:05:15,679 --> 00:05:16,590
Why?

106
00:05:18,146 --> 00:05:19,678
Because dad doesn't get along with Maris.

107
00:05:19,679 --> 00:05:20,663
Who does?

108
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,547
I thought you liked my Maris!

109
00:05:23,928 --> 00:05:25,204
I do. I...

110
00:05:25,205 --> 00:05:26,871
I like her from a distance.

111
00:05:27,403 --> 00:05:28,892
You know, the way you like the sun.

112
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,311
Maris is like the sun.

113
00:05:30,994 --> 00:05:32,270
Except without the warmth.

114
00:05:37,356 --> 00:05:40,019
Well, then, we're agreed about what to do with dad.

115
00:05:41,483 --> 00:05:44,939
"Golden Acres: We Care So You Don't Have To."

116
00:05:50,823 --> 00:05:51,998
It says that?

117
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:53,216
Well, it might as well!

118
00:05:56,049 --> 00:05:58,182
Alright, I'll make up the spare bedroom.

119
00:05:58,183 --> 00:06:01,606
Oh, you're a good son, Frasier.

120
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:05,480
Two café supremos. Anything to eat?

121
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:08,015
No. I seem to have lost my appetite.

122
00:06:08,561 --> 00:06:10,266
I'll have a large piece of cheesecake!

123
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:48,768
- Hi!
- We finally made it!

124
00:06:48,769 --> 00:06:52,048
Ah, dad, dad, welcome to your new home!

125
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:54,405
Gee, you look great!

126
00:06:54,406 --> 00:06:56,650
Don't B. S. me, I do not look great.

127
00:06:57,189 --> 00:06:59,041
I spent Monday on the bathroom floor.

128
00:06:59,042 --> 00:07:01,687
You can still se the tile marks on my face.

129
00:07:03,328 --> 00:07:05,549
Gives you some idea about the ride over in the car.

130
00:07:06,889 --> 00:07:08,802
Well, er, here we are...

131
00:07:09,668 --> 00:07:13,852
Rest assured the refrigerator is stocked with your favourite beer, Ballantines.

132
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:17,167
- and we've got plenty of hot links and coleslaw...
- Mmm!

133
00:07:17,281 --> 00:07:19,944
And I just rented a Charles Bronson movie for later!

134
00:07:19,945 --> 00:07:22,010
Let's cut the "Welcome To Camp Crane" speech.

135
00:07:22,011 --> 00:07:23,151
We all know why I'm here.

136
00:07:23,152 --> 00:07:26,191
Your old man can't be left alone for ten minutes without falling on his ass

137
00:07:26,192 --> 00:07:28,297
and Frasier got stuck with me.
Isn't that right?

138
00:07:28,998 --> 00:07:31,104
- No, no!
- No, no!

139
00:07:32,694 --> 00:07:35,876
I want you here! It'll give us a chance to get reacquainted!

140
00:07:35,877 --> 00:07:38,015
That implies we were acquainted at one point.

141
00:07:43,464 --> 00:07:45,625
Well, listen,

142
00:07:46,188 --> 00:07:48,565
why don't I take dad's things into his new bachelor quarters

143
00:07:48,566 --> 00:07:51,246
so you two scoundrels can plan some hijinks!

144
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:55,964
I think that wife of his is finally driving him nutso.

145
00:07:56,664 --> 00:08:00,647
Yes, we Crane boys sure know how to marry.

146
00:08:04,705 --> 00:08:06,845
Let me get you a beer, dad.

147
00:08:07,605 --> 00:08:10,848
So, ah, what do you think of what I've done with the place, eh?

148
00:08:10,849 --> 00:08:13,536
You know, every item has been carefully selected.

149
00:08:13,537 --> 00:08:16,170
This lamp by Corbusier, the chair by Eames,

150
00:08:16,171 --> 00:08:21,486
and this couch is an exact replica of the one Coco Chanel had in her Paris atelier.

151
00:08:21,487 --> 00:08:22,989
Nothing matches.

152
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:24,721
Well, it's a , it's a style of decorating.

153
00:08:24,722 --> 00:08:26,373
it's called "eclectic".

154
00:08:27,719 --> 00:08:28,847
Well, the theory behind it is,

155
00:08:28,848 --> 00:08:32,538
if you've got really fine pieces of furniture, it doesn't matter if they match

156
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:34,400
They will go together.

157
00:08:35,285 --> 00:08:36,463
It's your money.

158
00:08:40,643 --> 00:08:41,743
Dad, what do you think of the view?

159
00:08:41,744 --> 00:08:43,601
Hey, that's the Space Needle there!

160
00:08:43,602 --> 00:08:44,842
Oh, thanks for pointing that out.

161
00:08:44,843 --> 00:08:47,176
Being born and raised here, I never would have known.

162
00:08:51,185 --> 00:08:52,535
Delivery for Martin Crane.

163
00:08:52,536 --> 00:08:54,336
- Oh, in here!
- Coming through!

164
00:08:54,337 --> 00:08:56,445
Excuse me, excuse me, wait a minute

165
00:08:56,446 --> 00:08:58,617
- Where d'you want it?
- Where's the TV?

166
00:08:58,618 --> 00:09:01,514
- It's in that credenza.
- Point it at that thing.

167
00:09:01,515 --> 00:09:02,619
What about this chair?

168
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:04,724
Ah, the chair? Here, let me get it out of your way.

169
00:09:04,725 --> 00:09:06,614
Niles, Niles, Niles, be careful with that, that's a Wassily!

170
00:09:08,195 --> 00:09:11,899
Oh, look, dad, as dear as I'm sure this, this peace is to you I,

171
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,663
I just don't think it goes with anything here!

172
00:09:14,664 --> 00:09:16,569
I know, it's eclectic!

173
00:09:20,483 --> 00:09:22,579
Niles, Niles, will you help me out here?

174
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:24,823
Ah, you're gonna have to run an extension cord over here so

175
00:09:24,824 --> 00:09:26,792
I can plug in the vibrating part.

176
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:29,734
Oh yes, that will be the crowning touch.

177
00:09:34,046 --> 00:09:36,209
Well, now that you two are settled in, I've got to run.

178
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:38,729
I'm late for my dysfunctional family seminar.

179
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:43,259
Dad, have you mentioned Eddie yet?

180
00:09:43,893 --> 00:09:45,777
- Eddie?
- Ta-ta!

181
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:48,142
Oh, no, dad, no, no! Not Eddie!

182
00:09:48,143 --> 00:09:50,471
But he's my best friend! Get me my beer, would you?

183
00:09:50,472 --> 00:09:51,803
But he's weird!

184
00:09:53,007 --> 00:09:56,020
He gives me the creeps! All he does is stare at me.

185
00:09:56,021 --> 00:09:58,234
- Ah, it's just your imagination.
- No dad, no!

186
00:09:58,235 --> 00:10:02,567
No, I'm sorry, but I am putting my foot down. Eddie is NOT moving in here.

187
00:10:24,555 --> 00:10:27,405
Niles, there you are! I'm sorry I'm late

188
00:10:27,406 --> 00:10:31,629
just as I was leaving, dad decided to cook lunch by the glow of a small kitchen fire!

189
00:10:32,935 --> 00:10:36,329
Oh Niles, this last week with dad, it's, it's been a living hell!

190
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:38,727
When I'm there, I feel like my territory's being violated

191
00:10:38,728 --> 00:10:40,381
when I'm not, I'm worried about what he's up to.

192
00:10:40,906 --> 00:10:42,665
Look at me, look at me, I'm a nervous wreck!

193
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:45,079
I've got to do something to calm down. Double espresso, please!

194
00:10:46,472 --> 00:10:50,810
Niles, you don't still have the brochures from those rest homes, do you?

195
00:10:50,811 --> 00:10:51,690
Of course I do.

196
00:10:51,691 --> 00:10:53,915
Don't forget, Maris is five years older than I am.

197
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,200
But you really think that's necessary?

198
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:01,888
I'm afraid I do.

199
00:11:02,582 --> 00:11:04,159
I don't have my life anymore.

200
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,993
Tuesday night I gave up my tickets to the theatre, Wednesday it was the symphony...

201
00:11:07,994 --> 00:11:09,860
That reminds me, weren't you going to the opera on Friday?

202
00:11:09,861 --> 00:11:11,352
- Yes, here.
- Thank you.

203
00:11:14,778 --> 00:11:20,118
Niles, you don't suppose there's a chance that you and Maris could...

204
00:11:20,119 --> 00:11:21,201
Funny you should mention that.

205
00:11:21,202 --> 00:11:23,313
Maris and I were just discussing this.

206
00:11:23,314 --> 00:11:26,256
We feel we should do more to share the responsibility.

207
00:11:26,257 --> 00:11:27,593
You mean you'd take him in?

208
00:11:28,027 --> 00:11:28,594
Dear God, no!

209
00:11:31,802 --> 00:11:34,607
But we would be willing to help you pay for a home care worker.

210
00:11:34,608 --> 00:11:35,563
- A what?

211
00:11:35,564 --> 00:11:38,698
You know, someone who cooks and cleans and can help dad with his physical theraphy.

212
00:11:39,059 --> 00:11:40,907
These angels exist?

213
00:11:41,731 --> 00:11:42,870
I know of an agency

214
00:11:42,871 --> 00:11:45,425
let me arrange for them to send a few people over to meet with you.

215
00:11:46,752 --> 00:11:49,646
Niles, I can't thank you enough!

216
00:11:49,647 --> 00:11:52,700
I, I, I fell this overwhelming urge to hug you!

217
00:11:52,905 --> 00:11:54,057
Remember what Mom always said:

218
00:11:54,361 --> 00:11:55,775
"A handshake is as good as a hug."

219
00:11:58,531 --> 00:12:00,196
Wise woman.

220
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:05,841
I have never been more impressed with a human being in my life!

221
00:12:07,484 --> 00:12:09,149
Now what was wrong with that one?!

222
00:12:10,661 --> 00:12:12,224
She was casing the joint.

223
00:12:12,514 --> 00:12:13,999
"Casing the joint!"

224
00:12:14,556 --> 00:12:16,528
She spent two years with Mother Teresa!

225
00:12:17,842 --> 00:12:20,257
Well, if I were Mother Teresa, I'd check my jewellery box!

226
00:12:24,185 --> 00:12:27,721
Oh, this is the last one. Can you please try to keep an open mind?

227
00:12:29,358 --> 00:12:33,041
Oh! Hello - caught me with my hand in the biscuit tin!

228
00:12:33,988 --> 00:12:36,023
I'm Daphne, Daphne Moon.

229
00:12:36,273 --> 00:12:38,119
- Frasier Crane. Please come in.
- Thank you.

230
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:42,156
Eh, this is my father, Martin Crane. Dad, this is Daphne Moon.

231
00:12:42,157 --> 00:12:43,462
Nice to meet you.

232
00:12:44,144 --> 00:12:45,803
Oh, and who might this be?

233
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:47,847
That is Eddie.

234
00:12:52,901 --> 00:12:54,236
I call him "Eddie Spaghetti".

235
00:12:54,237 --> 00:12:55,805
Oh, he likes pasta?

236
00:12:55,806 --> 00:12:57,200
No, he has worms.

237
00:13:01,754 --> 00:13:04,772
Er, have a seat, Miss Moon.

238
00:13:04,773 --> 00:13:06,673
Daphne. Thank you.

239
00:13:08,281 --> 00:13:12,392
Oh, will you look at that. What a comfy chair!

240
00:13:12,393 --> 00:13:14,263
It's like I always say,

241
00:13:14,264 --> 00:13:18,201
start with a good piece and replace the rest when you can afford it.

242
00:13:25,636 --> 00:13:27,378
Yes. Well, er,

243
00:13:27,379 --> 00:13:30,194
perhaps you should start by telling us a little bit about yourself, Miss Moon.

244
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:33,516
Well, I'm originally from Manchester, England...

245
00:13:33,517 --> 00:13:34,668
Oh really, did you hear that dad?

246
00:13:34,669 --> 00:13:36,976
I'm three feet away. There's nothing wrong with my hearing.

247
00:13:40,512 --> 00:13:43,419
I've only been in the U.S. for a few months,

248
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:49,524
but I have quite an extensive background in home care and physical therapy,

249
00:13:49,525 --> 00:13:52,239
as you can see from my resume. I...

250
00:13:53,388 --> 00:13:55,353
You were a policeman, weren't you?

251
00:13:55,354 --> 00:13:56,531
Yeah - how'd you know?

252
00:13:57,188 --> 00:14:00,766
I must confess - I'm a bit psychic.

253
00:14:03,444 --> 00:14:07,632
It's nothing big, just little things I sense about people.

254
00:14:07,633 --> 00:14:09,543
I mean, it's not like I can pick the lottery.

255
00:14:09,544 --> 00:14:12,624
If I could, I wouldn't be talking to the likes of you two, now would I?

256
00:14:15,556 --> 00:14:18,135
Yes. Perhaps I should describe the duties around here.

257
00:14:18,136 --> 00:14:19,216
You would be responsible for...

258
00:14:19,217 --> 00:14:21,884
Oh, wait a minute, I'm getting something on you...

259
00:14:22,871 --> 00:14:24,316
You're a florist!

260
00:14:27,131 --> 00:14:29,023
No, I'm a psychiatrist.

261
00:14:29,024 --> 00:14:30,776
Well, it comes and goes.

262
00:14:32,611 --> 00:14:36,125
Usually, it's strongest during my time of the month.

263
00:14:36,588 --> 00:14:39,675
Oh, I guess I let a little secret put out there, didn't I?

264
00:14:41,109 --> 00:14:42,705
It's safe with us.

265
00:14:44,737 --> 00:14:47,479
Well, Miss Moon, I think we've learned just about all we need to know about you,

266
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,352
and a dash extra!

267
00:14:52,033 --> 00:14:53,424
You're a dog, aren't you?

268
00:14:58,585 --> 00:15:00,909
Well, we'll, er, we'll be calling you, Miss Moon.

269
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:02,841
Oh, why wait? You've got the job!

270
00:15:02,842 --> 00:15:04,017
Oh, wonderful!

271
00:15:04,018 --> 00:15:07,457
Er, excuse me, excuse me, aren't you just forgetting a little something here?

272
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:09,753
Don't you think we should talk about this in private?

273
00:15:09,754 --> 00:15:12,868
Oh, of course you should, I completely understand.

274
00:15:12,869 --> 00:15:14,729
I'll just pop into the loo.

275
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:16,434
You do have one, don't you?

276
00:15:16,435 --> 00:15:18,948
- Yes.
- Oh, I love America...

277
00:15:23,171 --> 00:15:24,306
Dad, what do you think you're doing?

278
00:15:24,307 --> 00:15:26,020
You wanted me to pick one. I picked one.

279
00:15:26,021 --> 00:15:27,576
But she's a kook! I don't like her!

280
00:15:27,577 --> 00:15:29,400
Well, what difference does it make to you?

281
00:15:29,401 --> 00:15:31,145
She's only gonna be here when you're not.

282
00:15:32,093 --> 00:15:34,121
Then... what's my problem?

283
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,742
Daphne!

284
00:15:37,496 --> 00:15:38,554
You've been retained.

285
00:15:38,555 --> 00:15:39,904
Oh, wonderful!

286
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:41,660
I had a premonition.

287
00:15:41,661 --> 00:15:42,949
Quelle surprise.

288
00:15:45,383 --> 00:15:47,234
I'll move my things in tomorrow.

289
00:15:47,235 --> 00:15:48,177
Oh, move in?

290
00:15:48,461 --> 00:15:52,129
Oh, I'm sorry, there must be some misunderstanding. Er, This isn't a live-in position

291
00:15:52,179 --> 00:15:54,302
Oh, dear. Well the lady at the agency...

292
00:15:54,303 --> 00:15:57,056
The lady at the agency was wrong; this is just a part-time position.

293
00:15:57,057 --> 00:15:59,050
I'm, I'm afraid it just won't work out.

294
00:15:59,051 --> 00:16:01,048
Hold on there, Frasier, let's talk about this!

295
00:16:01,049 --> 00:16:02,651
Dad, there's nothing to discuss!

296
00:16:02,652 --> 00:16:04,384
You two should talk about this.

297
00:16:04,385 --> 00:16:08,454
so I'll just pop back in here and enjoy some more of your African erotic art.

298
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:12,280
Daphne, Daphne, I think it would be best if you leave.

299
00:16:12,281 --> 00:16:14,193
Oh well, alright then.

300
00:16:14,732 --> 00:16:16,916
Don't be alarmed. We'll contact you.

301
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:20,350
If not by telephone then, er, through the toaster.

302
00:16:27,225 --> 00:16:29,811
Dad, I'm not having another person living in this house!

303
00:16:29,812 --> 00:16:31,215
Give me one good reason why not!

304
00:16:31,216 --> 00:16:32,574
Well, for one thing, there's no room for her!

305
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:34,508
What about that room right across the hall from mine?

306
00:16:34,509 --> 00:16:36,258
My study? You expect me to give up my study

307
00:16:36,259 --> 00:16:38,635
the place where I read, where I do my most profound thinking?

308
00:16:38,636 --> 00:16:41,639
Ah, use the can like the rest of the world!

309
00:16:44,391 --> 00:16:45,521
You'll adjust!

310
00:16:45,522 --> 00:16:48,177
I don't want to adjust! I've done enough adjusting!

311
00:16:48,178 --> 00:16:51,961
I'm in a new city, I've got a new job, I'm separated from my little boy,

312
00:16:51,962 --> 00:16:54,061
which in itself is enough to drive me nuts.

313
00:16:54,062 --> 00:16:56,971
And now my father and his dog are living with me!

314
00:16:56,972 --> 00:16:58,757
Well, that's enough on my plate, thank you.

315
00:16:58,758 --> 00:17:02,367
The whole idea of getting somebody in here was to help ease my burden, not to add to it!

316
00:17:02,368 --> 00:17:04,856
Oh, do you hear that, Eddie? We're a burden.

317
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,880
Oh dad, dad you're, you're twisting my words!

318
00:17:06,881 --> 00:17:09,449
I meant burden in its most positive sense!

319
00:17:11,536 --> 00:17:13,861
As in, "Gee, what a lovely burden?"

320
00:17:14,482 --> 00:17:16,351
Something like that, yes!

321
00:17:16,352 --> 00:17:18,257
Well, you're not the only one who got screwed here, you know.

322
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:22,934
Two years ago I'm sailing toward retirement and some punk robbing a convenience store puts a bullet in my hip.

323
00:17:23,315 --> 00:17:25,600
Next thing you know, I'm trading in my golf clubs for one of these.

324
00:17:26,373 --> 00:17:27,861
Well, I had plans too, you know!

325
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,584
And this may come as a shock to you, sonny boy, but one of them wasn't living with you.

326
00:17:31,585 --> 00:17:33,496
I'm just trying to do the right thing, here.

327
00:17:33,497 --> 00:17:34,882
I'm trying to be The Good Son.

328
00:17:34,883 --> 00:17:35,766
Oh, don't worry, son.

329
00:17:35,767 --> 00:17:37,409
After I'm gone you can live guilt-free,

330
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:38,974
knowing you've done right by your pop.

331
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:40,695
You think that's what this is about, guilt?

332
00:17:40,696 --> 00:17:41,278
Isn't it?

333
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:42,552
Of course it is!

334
00:17:42,788 --> 00:17:45,560
But the point is, I did it! I took you in!

335
00:17:45,561 --> 00:17:47,701
And I've got news for you - I wanted to do it!

336
00:17:47,915 --> 00:17:49,347
Because you're my father.

337
00:17:50,568 --> 00:17:51,582
And how do you repay me?

338
00:17:51,705 --> 00:17:56,754
Ever since you've moved in here it's been a snide comment about this or a smart little put-down about that.

339
00:17:56,755 --> 00:17:59,271
Well, I've done my best to make a home here for you,

340
00:17:59,272 --> 00:18:03,194
and once, just once, would it have killed you to say "thank you?"

341
00:18:03,735 --> 00:18:05,391
One lousy "thank you?"

342
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:18,103
Come on, Eddie, it's past your dinner time.

343
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:21,208
I'm going out.

344
00:18:36,071 --> 00:18:38,235
They have got to move the bathroom closer to the studio!

345
00:18:40,181 --> 00:18:42,389
We'll be right back after these messages.

346
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:43,881
Can't I put that on tape?!

347
00:18:46,174 --> 00:18:47,674
What's eating you?

348
00:18:48,304 --> 00:18:49,553
Oh, I'm sorry.

349
00:18:49,554 --> 00:18:53,876
It's just this thing with my father and this, this person he wants to hire.

350
00:18:53,877 --> 00:18:56,796
I thought I'd started my life with a clean slate.

351
00:18:57,288 --> 00:18:59,612
I had a picture of what it was going to be like, and then,

352
00:19:00,844 --> 00:19:01,895
I don't know...

353
00:19:02,722 --> 00:19:04,630
Ever heard of Lupe Velez?

354
00:19:04,631 --> 00:19:05,358
Who?

355
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:09,011
Lupe Velez - the movie star in the '30s.

356
00:19:10,015 --> 00:19:12,118
Well, her career hit the skids,

357
00:19:12,361 --> 00:19:15,914
so she decided she's make one final stab at immortality.

358
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:18,394
She figured if she couldn't be remembered for her movies,

359
00:19:18,395 --> 00:19:20,904
she'd be remembered for the way she died.

360
00:19:20,905 --> 00:19:23,452
And all Lupe wanted was to be remembered.

361
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:26,066
So, she plans this lavish suicide

362
00:19:26,067 --> 00:19:31,022
flowers, candles, silk sheets, white satin gown, full hair and makeup, the works.

363
00:19:31,463 --> 00:19:33,580
She takes the overdose of pills,

364
00:19:33,581 --> 00:19:34,944
lays on the bed,

365
00:19:34,945 --> 00:19:40,319
and imagines how beautiful she's going to look on the front page of tomorrow's newspaper.

366
00:19:40,691 --> 00:19:42,095
Unfortunately,

367
00:19:42,096 --> 00:19:47,407
the pills don't sit well with the Enchilada combo plate she sadly chose as her last meal.

368
00:19:49,096 --> 00:19:50,574
She stumbles to the bathroom,

369
00:19:50,575 --> 00:19:52,531
trips and goes head-first in the toilet,

370
00:19:52,532 --> 00:19:54,166
and that's how they found her.

371
00:19:57,216 --> 00:19:59,292
Is there a reason you're telling me this story?

372
00:19:59,969 --> 00:20:01,110
Yes.

373
00:20:01,598 --> 00:20:04,135
Even though things may not happen like we planned,

374
00:20:04,582 --> 00:20:06,002
they can work out anyway.

375
00:20:07,618 --> 00:20:10,596
Remind me again how it worked for Lupe,

376
00:20:11,123 --> 00:20:13,484
last seen with her head in the toilet?

377
00:20:14,308 --> 00:20:16,876
All she wanted was to be remembered.

378
00:20:17,212 --> 00:20:19,316
Will you ever forget that story?

379
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:24,406
We're back.

380
00:20:24,984 --> 00:20:26,662
Roz, who's our next caller?

381
00:20:27,435 --> 00:20:29,179
We have Martin on line one.

382
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:31,445
He's having a problem with his son.

383
00:20:33,591 --> 00:20:37,558
Hello, Martin. This is Dr. Frasier Crane; I'm listening.

384
00:20:37,792 --> 00:20:39,762
I'm a first-time caller.

385
00:20:45,527 --> 00:20:49,334
Welcome to the show. How can I help you?

386
00:20:49,754 --> 00:20:52,053
I've just move in with my son and er,

387
00:20:53,726 --> 00:20:57,546
it ain't working. There's a lot of tension between us.

388
00:20:57,547 --> 00:20:58,622
I can imagine.

389
00:20:59,227 --> 00:21:00,502
Why do you think that's so?

390
00:21:01,542 --> 00:21:05,494
I guess I didn't see he had a whole new life planned for himself,

391
00:21:05,495 --> 00:21:07,514
and I kinda got in the way.

392
00:21:07,515 --> 00:21:09,909
Well, these things are a two-way street.

393
00:21:10,533 --> 00:21:16,035
Perhaps your son wasn't sensitive enough to see how your life was changing.

394
00:21:16,036 --> 00:21:18,890
You got that right! I've been telling him that since I got there!

395
00:21:21,526 --> 00:21:23,776
I'm sure he appreciated your candour.

396
00:21:24,335 --> 00:21:27,136
Well, maybe sometimes I oughta just learn how to keep my trap shut.

397
00:21:27,137 --> 00:21:28,629
That's good advice for us all.

398
00:21:32,139 --> 00:21:33,173
Anything else?

399
00:21:33,983 --> 00:21:37,496
Yeah, I'm worried my son doesn't know that I really appreciate what he's doing for me.

400
00:21:39,435 --> 00:21:40,420
Why don't you tell him?

401
00:21:40,421 --> 00:21:43,268
Well, you know how it is with fathers and sons, it...

402
00:21:43,327 --> 00:21:44,782
I have trouble saying that stuff.

403
00:21:46,323 --> 00:21:51,879
Well, if it helps, I suspect your son already knows how you feel.

404
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:56,894
Is that all?

405
00:21:57,461 --> 00:21:59,392
Yeah, that's it. Thank you, Dr. Crane.

406
00:22:00,207 --> 00:22:01,593
My pleasure, Martin.

407
00:22:01,594 --> 00:22:03,558
Did you hear what I said? I said "thank you!"

408
00:22:03,559 --> 00:22:04,870
Yes, I heard.

409
00:22:11,369 --> 00:22:14,085
Dr. Crane, we have Claire on line four.

410
00:22:14,086 --> 00:22:16,945
She's having a problem getting over a relationship.

411
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:21,103
Hello, Claire. I'm listening.

412
00:22:21,104 --> 00:22:26,217
I'm a, well, I'm a mess!

413
00:22:27,227 --> 00:22:29,822
Eight months ago my boyfriend and I broke up,

414
00:22:30,496 --> 00:22:32,369
and I just can't get over it.

415
00:22:33,332 --> 00:22:37,731
The pain isn't going away. It's almost like I'm in mourning or something.

416
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:41,117
Claire, you are in mourning.

417
00:22:42,116 --> 00:22:44,905
But you're not mourning the loss of your boyfriend...

418
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:49,649
You're mourning the loss of what you thought your life was going to be.

419
00:22:51,843 --> 00:22:52,783
Let it go.

420
00:22:53,779 --> 00:22:55,556
Things don't always work out how you planned;

421
00:22:56,474 --> 00:22:58,216
that's not necessarily bad.

422
00:22:59,792 --> 00:23:01,685
Things have a way or working out anyway.

423
00:23:03,365 --> 00:23:06,103
Have you ever heard of Lupe Velez?
