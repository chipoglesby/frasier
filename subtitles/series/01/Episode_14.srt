1
00:00:07,765 --> 00:00:11,644
- Hello, rachel.
- 'thanks for taking my call.

2
00:00:11,982 --> 00:00:15,577
'I'm involved in a strange love triangle.'

3
00:00:15,906 --> 00:00:19,615
- This is sweeps week!
- 'I recently married a widower.

4
00:00:19,956 --> 00:00:23,631
'Phil is a real good man, he's a kind man.

5
00:00:23,964 --> 00:00:25,920
'But there's one problem.

6
00:00:26,177 --> 00:00:29,249
'He insists on keeping an urn
with his late wife's ashes

7
00:00:29,559 --> 00:00:34,474
- 'on the dresser in our bedroom.'
- That is a definite "yikes".

8
00:00:34,861 --> 00:00:37,329
'I knew that wasn't normal!
He says it is... '

9
00:00:37,617 --> 00:00:41,610
rachel, before you go off half-cocked,
let's try to remember,

10
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:43,869
this is a sensitive issue
for your husband.

11
00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:46,643
Those ashes mean a lot to him.

12
00:00:46,927 --> 00:00:49,805
It's not appropriate
to keep them in the bedroom,

13
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,330
but you could move them
to another room.

14
00:00:52,605 --> 00:00:56,280
'I could try that. Maybe i'll move them
into the guest room.'

15
00:00:56,613 --> 00:00:57,966
 

16
00:00:58,199 --> 00:00:59,951
'Oops! '

17
00:01:01,957 --> 00:01:06,553
- What happened?
- 'Oh, nothing. I'd better run, dr crane.

18
00:01:06,925 --> 00:01:09,803
'I've got some vacuuming to do.'

19
00:01:10,098 --> 00:01:14,888
As rachel helps
phil's first wife off the floor,

20
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:18,347
we're at the end of our second hour.
We're back after the news.

21
00:01:18,657 --> 00:01:23,333
Please join me, frasier crane,
and my invaluable producer...

22
00:01:24,919 --> 00:01:28,355
...uh... uh...

23
00:01:28,677 --> 00:01:31,510
- roz!
- Roz.

24
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,950
Kacl talk radio, 780am.

25
00:01:40,366 --> 00:01:42,357
Roz, i'm so sorry!

26
00:01:42,622 --> 00:01:46,012
Your name was in front of me,
and i couldn't put my finger on it!

27
00:01:46,337 --> 00:01:50,250
- Forget about it.
- It's been happening to me a lot lately.

28
00:01:50,595 --> 00:01:55,225
Last night i walked into the kitchen,
and i couldn't remember what for.

29
00:01:55,605 --> 00:01:58,915
- Don't make yourself crazy. It's normal.
- Ok.

30
00:01:59,238 --> 00:02:01,593
Your hairstylist
confirmed your appointment.

31
00:02:01,868 --> 00:02:04,177
I don't remember making one.

32
00:02:04,456 --> 00:02:07,095
You didn't. I was just gaslighting you.

33
00:02:08,506 --> 00:02:10,622
- That is not funny!
- Oh, lighten up.

34
00:02:10,886 --> 00:02:13,764
- Here, sign these.
- All right.

35
00:02:14,811 --> 00:02:17,883
Will you say it
or make me wait till the end of the day?

36
00:02:18,192 --> 00:02:20,581
- Say what?
- "Happy birthday."

37
00:02:20,865 --> 00:02:22,821
It is not your birthday.

38
00:02:24,747 --> 00:02:30,026
Oh, god, it is! Oh, roz, i'm so sorry!
Let me take you out after work, ok?

39
00:02:30,425 --> 00:02:34,498
- You are so easy!
- Oh, that's it! I'm out of here!

40
00:02:34,851 --> 00:02:38,639
- Aren't you forgetting something?
- No, i am not!

41
00:02:38,984 --> 00:02:41,942
You can't blame a girl for trying.

42
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,550
Five, four, three, two...

43
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:49,147
we're back.

44
00:02:51,968 --> 00:02:53,924
 

45
00:02:55,809 --> 00:02:57,208
Ten.

46
00:02:57,437 --> 00:02:58,631
15-2.

47
00:02:58,857 --> 00:03:04,727
No, eddie, no. Dad, ask your dog
to stop burrowing at my shoes.

48
00:03:06,455 --> 00:03:10,209
It took six months to have them sent
from a blind cobbler in seville.

49
00:03:11,632 --> 00:03:16,660
- He won't stop till you scratch him.
- Oh. All right, eddie, all right.

50
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:28,154
You know, i'm beginning to think
i have an affinity for animals.

51
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,657
Would you mind
if i noodle at the piano?

52
00:03:30,921 --> 00:03:34,470
- Would it stop you if we said, "yes"?
- Point well taken.

53
00:03:36,056 --> 00:03:40,208
 

54
00:03:41,609 --> 00:03:43,600
 

55
00:03:43,864 --> 00:03:48,380
That's strange. For the life of me,
i can't remember the next note.

56
00:03:54,009 --> 00:03:55,920
 

57
00:03:57,265 --> 00:03:59,256
I know this backwards and forwards!

58
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,432
Perhaps if you start at the end,
you'll have better luck.

59
00:04:12,128 --> 00:04:14,084
 

60
00:04:14,341 --> 00:04:18,300
Oh, come on. You know how it goes.
It goes: Da-da-da-da...

61
00:04:18,641 --> 00:04:22,190
oh, thank you, dad.
Now it's perfectly clear

62
00:04:24,194 --> 00:04:26,150
 

63
00:04:28,954 --> 00:04:33,391
That was very nice, son. How about
something from "south pacific"?

64
00:04:34,924 --> 00:04:38,712
I'm sorry, i'm just getting fed up
with this nonsense.

65
00:04:39,057 --> 00:04:44,006
I keep forgetting names. Last week,
twice i forgot where i parked my car.

66
00:04:44,401 --> 00:04:47,074
Join the club, pal. You're getting older.

67
00:04:47,365 --> 00:04:51,404
Of course i'm getting older.
We all are. I'm not that old.

68
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:55,139
I'm afraid dad may have a point.
I know you'd like to believe

69
00:04:55,465 --> 00:04:59,617
we're still the same devilish sprigs
we always were,

70
00:04:59,974 --> 00:05:02,568
sitting on mother's davenport
in our tweeds and tams

71
00:05:02,855 --> 00:05:05,369
listening to the
"texaco symphonic hour".

72
00:05:07,823 --> 00:05:11,418
But the cold, hard reality
is you're middle-aged.

73
00:05:11,747 --> 00:05:16,582
I'm 41. that's hardly middle-aged.
Middle-aged is more like 50, 55.

74
00:05:16,966 --> 00:05:18,922
Only if you live to be 110.

75
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:22,824
I'm ready to go.

76
00:05:23,104 --> 00:05:25,937
- Where are you off to?
- I'm giving daphne a lift.

77
00:05:26,235 --> 00:05:30,751
I'm meeting me friends for darts
and a few pints. It's best in that order.

78
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,998
Just ask blind willie, the bartender.

79
00:05:35,838 --> 00:05:39,228
Before you go,
i'd like to ask you a little question.

80
00:05:39,553 --> 00:05:44,786
When you look at me, do you see me
as a young man or as an older man?

81
00:05:45,189 --> 00:05:48,784
Oh, no, you don't.
You're not getting me into that vietnam.

82
00:05:50,033 --> 00:05:53,548
There are three questions
you never answer honestly:

83
00:05:53,874 --> 00:05:55,830
"How old do i look?",
"do you like me hair?",

84
00:05:56,086 --> 00:05:58,395
and "was it good for you, too?"

85
00:05:59,801 --> 00:06:02,235
Coming, dr crane?

86
00:06:04,603 --> 00:06:06,355
Dr crane?

87
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:10,373
I'm sorry, i was someplace else.

88
00:06:11,825 --> 00:06:13,975
It was a warm and friendly place.

89
00:06:24,894 --> 00:06:29,331
Big surprise, i got a headache.
I need to get an aspirin.

90
00:06:29,694 --> 00:06:33,926
The very suggestion
that i'm descending into old age...

91
00:06:34,287 --> 00:06:39,202
just because i can't remember
some names and a tune on the piano.

92
00:06:41,009 --> 00:06:43,887
Your arm's not long enough
for that, is it?

93
00:06:44,182 --> 00:06:46,377
Let me ask you a few questions.

94
00:06:46,645 --> 00:06:51,082
Can you get through the night
without having to go to the john?

95
00:06:51,447 --> 00:06:56,202
Can you get in and out of a chair
without going, "arrrgh"?

96
00:06:56,582 --> 00:07:01,975
Can you eat a slice of pizza less than
twelve hours before you go to bed?

97
00:07:02,385 --> 00:07:06,264
- What's on the pizza?
- Ah, i thought so.

98
00:07:06,602 --> 00:07:10,595
Now that we've established
you're middle-aged, take some advice.

99
00:07:10,944 --> 00:07:13,174
Don't fight it. It'll go a lot easier.

100
00:07:13,449 --> 00:07:16,168
Are you suggesting
i'll rush off to a surgeon

101
00:07:16,455 --> 00:07:18,730
for an eye lift and a chin tuck?

102
00:07:19,002 --> 00:07:21,391
Oh, dear god!

103
00:07:21,673 --> 00:07:24,346
When guys get to this stage,

104
00:07:24,638 --> 00:07:27,277
they do things
they would never have done before.

105
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,516
Dad, please spare me.
I am a psychiatrist,

106
00:07:29,773 --> 00:07:33,448
- i know the routine.
- Who is that?

107
00:07:33,781 --> 00:07:37,137
That's me, in '74,
going through my own little stage.

108
00:07:37,455 --> 00:07:41,528
I died my hair black, bought a
leather jacket and a harley davidson.

109
00:07:43,592 --> 00:07:46,664
My god, dad,
you look like one of the village people.

110
00:07:48,811 --> 00:07:52,326
I came to my senses before you
got back from harvard that summer.

111
00:07:52,652 --> 00:07:57,931
- Are those love beads?
- All right, that's enough.

112
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:03,882
Just keep your guard up,
and don't do something stupid, all right?

113
00:08:04,301 --> 00:08:06,451
- Ok, dad.
- You might think it's tough

114
00:08:06,722 --> 00:08:09,919
being middle-aged, but think about me.

115
00:08:10,229 --> 00:08:12,743
I got a son who's middle-aged.

116
00:08:15,531 --> 00:08:17,487
 

117
00:08:17,744 --> 00:08:19,894
'I heard that.'

118
00:08:27,222 --> 00:08:29,816
Didn't this use to be pinsky's store?

119
00:08:30,102 --> 00:08:33,936
- No idea.
- We'd bring you kids here all the time.

120
00:08:34,277 --> 00:08:37,553
Man, it was a great store.
You could buy lingerie,

121
00:08:37,867 --> 00:08:41,064
a bag of popcorn and transmission fluid,
all under the same roof.

122
00:08:42,252 --> 00:08:44,686
Finally something i'm glad i forgot.

123
00:08:46,218 --> 00:08:48,778
I believe i came here on a mission.

124
00:08:49,057 --> 00:08:52,254
I don't want anything fancy
or that comes in tubes.

125
00:08:52,564 --> 00:08:55,032
I want them white, plain and boxers.

126
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:59,795
That kind of lack of imagination
sunk the british empire.

127
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:06,789
Check out these dress pants.
They got elastic panels in the waist.

128
00:09:07,176 --> 00:09:10,248
You can eat all you want
and not cut off your circulation.

129
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:14,545
Milan must be beside itself.

130
00:09:15,651 --> 00:09:18,324
An innovative use of synthetic fibres.

131
00:09:18,616 --> 00:09:21,653
You can recycle these
and turn them into milk containers.

132
00:09:21,955 --> 00:09:24,025
You going to get them or not?

133
00:09:24,294 --> 00:09:27,206
You brought these over for me?

134
00:09:27,508 --> 00:09:30,944
The sands of time are shifting,
mostly south.

135
00:09:31,266 --> 00:09:34,736
Maybe you could go with suspenders.

136
00:09:35,065 --> 00:09:39,104
If you keep your jacket closed,
your gut can hang down to here.

137
00:09:39,449 --> 00:09:43,761
I do not have a gut! I have contours.

138
00:09:45,962 --> 00:09:48,795
Excuse me. Is anyone helping you?

139
00:09:49,094 --> 00:09:51,927
Oh, no!
She's looking at something with stripes!

140
00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:56,184
Daphne! Come on, let's go!

141
00:09:56,525 --> 00:10:00,677
You're not getting those, are you?
I have something much better here.

142
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:03,069
What do you think of these?

143
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:06,561
They could work on
a nice tall guy like you.

144
00:10:06,878 --> 00:10:11,269
- You really think so?
- Yeah, you've got a great build.

145
00:10:11,638 --> 00:10:14,710
- Thank you very much, uh...
- carrie.

146
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:17,136
- Carrie.
- Let's see.

147
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:21,109
This is kind of a young look,
but you could really pull it off.

148
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:24,408
I don't really think it's me.

149
00:10:24,706 --> 00:10:27,618
Are you sure?
This would look good on you.

150
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,516
I could try it on. But just out of curiosity,
how old do you think i am?

151
00:10:32,889 --> 00:10:36,040
- I don't want to do that.
- No, please. Go ahead.

152
00:10:36,355 --> 00:10:39,472
I don't know, um... 36?

153
00:10:39,778 --> 00:10:41,928
Are you serious?

154
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:46,432
Sorry, you're probably 34.
Now you don't want to buy anything.

155
00:10:46,792 --> 00:10:50,831
Are those armani shirts expensive?

156
00:10:52,178 --> 00:10:54,248
- Yeah.
- I'll take two.

157
00:10:54,516 --> 00:10:57,952
- Great. Changing room's right this way.
- Ah.

158
00:10:58,273 --> 00:11:02,551
I love to guess what my customers do
by what they wear.

159
00:11:02,907 --> 00:11:06,502
- You're an architect, right?
- No, i'm a psychiatrist.

160
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:11,667
Oh, i've taken psychology courses.
What are you, freudian, reichian?

161
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:17,761
Lately, i've been leaning more towards
jung because i'm "jung" at heart.

162
00:11:18,856 --> 00:11:21,006
The oldest joke in the shrinks' book.

163
00:11:21,653 --> 00:11:24,690
- Can't believe i said it.
- I can't believe i laughed.

164
00:11:24,993 --> 00:11:26,870
You must laugh at all customers' jokes.

165
00:11:27,122 --> 00:11:29,238
No, just the cute ones.

166
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:35,981
- Cute jokes or customers?
- You figure it out.

167
00:11:45,409 --> 00:11:48,321
- You ready?
- I'm trying on some pants.

168
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:51,616
Did you notice that girl that helped us?

169
00:11:51,922 --> 00:11:53,878
Sure. I'm not dead.

170
00:11:55,513 --> 00:11:57,469
We just had a little conversation,

171
00:11:57,725 --> 00:12:01,320
and i could swear
she was flirting with me.

172
00:12:03,737 --> 00:12:06,649
Trust me, son, she's on commission.

173
00:12:07,954 --> 00:12:11,424
Oh, no, that was no sales pitch.

174
00:12:11,753 --> 00:12:15,871
She is definitely interested in me.
I'll have to see where this may lead.

175
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:20,611
I know you're forgetting things,
but don't you remember our little talk?

176
00:12:22,316 --> 00:12:25,228
Oh, dear,
it sneaks right up on you, doesn't it?

177
00:12:25,531 --> 00:12:30,366
What am i thinking? A 41 -year-old man
going out with a girl of 22, 23?

178
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:34,663
- Young enough to be your daughter.
- Thanks for pointing that out.

179
00:12:37,638 --> 00:12:39,594
This is dr frasier crane,

180
00:12:39,851 --> 00:12:43,082
kacl talk radio
thanking you for joining us today.

181
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:49,032
Up next, bob "bulldog" brisco
and the "gonzo sports show"!

182
00:12:49,454 --> 00:12:53,891
Until tomorrow,
here's wishing you good mental health.

183
00:12:55,173 --> 00:12:59,564
Hey, doc. Hear the news?
Ken griffey jr's groin pull is healed!

184
00:12:59,933 --> 00:13:02,970
Thank god.
We'll all remember where we were

185
00:13:03,272 --> 00:13:05,308
when we heard the joyful news.

186
00:13:05,569 --> 00:13:08,766
- Excuse me, dr crane?
- Hi, carrie.

187
00:13:09,076 --> 00:13:11,874
- Hi, i have your pants.
- Whoa, doc!

188
00:13:12,165 --> 00:13:14,360
 

189
00:13:15,506 --> 00:13:17,940
- Where'd you leave them?
- They're new.

190
00:13:18,219 --> 00:13:20,938
Finer stores
deliver garments to their customers.

191
00:13:21,225 --> 00:13:24,137
We don't.
I just wanted to see you again.

192
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:27,876
Excuse me. You look very familiar.

193
00:13:28,197 --> 00:13:31,826
Didn't i let you pour a flaming tequila
shooter down my throat

194
00:13:32,164 --> 00:13:35,474
at sloppy nick's
during last year's indy 500?

195
00:13:35,796 --> 00:13:39,755
- Er, no.
- What you doing next memorial day?

196
00:13:40,096 --> 00:13:42,690
As certain as i am that any young lady

197
00:13:42,977 --> 00:13:46,652
would love to set your face on fire,
carrie is here to see me.

198
00:13:46,985 --> 00:13:49,135
You can't blame a dog for trying.

199
00:13:50,409 --> 00:13:54,880
Just on the off chance it might make
a difference, i drive a '94 camaro.

200
00:13:57,255 --> 00:14:00,088
Is he gay?

201
00:14:00,387 --> 00:14:04,778
I've been studying about this.
It seems like he's overcompensating.

202
00:14:05,146 --> 00:14:09,822
I'm not sure, but i look forward
to running that theory by him.

203
00:14:10,198 --> 00:14:14,908
Thank you for the pants.
Do i owe you anything?

204
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:18,681
No, i enjoyed meeting
you yesterday,

205
00:14:19,007 --> 00:14:21,362
and we had a few laughs together.

206
00:14:21,638 --> 00:14:25,916
And maybe we could go out
and have a cup of coffee sometime.

207
00:14:26,272 --> 00:14:30,151
Listen, carrie, i'm very flattered
that you'd like to go out with me,

208
00:14:30,489 --> 00:14:34,164
and you're a beautiful young woman...

209
00:14:34,497 --> 00:14:38,410
- but?
- Well, it's our ages. How old are you?

210
00:14:38,755 --> 00:14:40,905
22. how old are you?

211
00:14:41,176 --> 00:14:43,326
That's not polite.

212
00:14:44,726 --> 00:14:47,445
It wouldn't be appropriate for us to date.

213
00:14:47,732 --> 00:14:50,121
How about we just live together?

214
00:14:51,907 --> 00:14:54,899
I'm just lightening
an uncomfortable moment.

215
00:14:55,204 --> 00:14:58,992
- Ha-ha, well done.
- Well, i'm sorry,

216
00:14:59,338 --> 00:15:02,728
but if you change your mind,
you know where i am.

217
00:15:03,054 --> 00:15:07,332
- Enjoy your pants.
- Same to you.

218
00:15:13,825 --> 00:15:17,500
I only got a second here, but...
hello!

219
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:20,666
Anyone there?

220
00:15:20,965 --> 00:15:23,923
She wanted to go out with you!
You didn't have to chase her!

221
00:15:24,221 --> 00:15:26,177
You didn't have to harass her.

222
00:15:26,434 --> 00:15:29,904
You didn't have to pay her!
It was like a miracle!

223
00:15:31,235 --> 00:15:33,954
- She's too young!
- Are you following this?

224
00:15:34,241 --> 00:15:36,675
- I don't expect you to understand.
- I don't. You're not dating her?

225
00:15:36,955 --> 00:15:40,072
- No.
- Good. Maybe i can catch up with her.

226
00:15:40,378 --> 00:15:42,846
Maybe she's never dated
an ex-pro hockey player.

227
00:15:43,134 --> 00:15:45,602
You've never played hockey.

228
00:15:45,889 --> 00:15:48,801
It's like we're from different planets.

229
00:15:50,064 --> 00:15:52,100
- Talk about pathetic.
- Isn't he?

230
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:56,638
- I meant you.
- You think i should go out with her?

231
00:15:56,995 --> 00:15:59,463
It's hard enough to find somebody.

232
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:02,345
When an opportunity comes along,
grab it.

233
00:16:02,632 --> 00:16:06,227
- What about the age thing?
- What about it?

234
00:16:06,556 --> 00:16:11,152
You see an old man in the street
with a young girl, what do you think?

235
00:16:11,524 --> 00:16:14,243
I think he must be really rich.

236
00:16:15,991 --> 00:16:19,461
- Then i try to make eye contact.
- Ah.

237
00:16:25,511 --> 00:16:28,548
There you are, frasier.
I'm so glad you called me.

238
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:31,045
Thanks for coming.

239
00:16:31,856 --> 00:16:36,247
Maris's friends introduced me to
a party game i'd like to share with you...

240
00:16:36,616 --> 00:16:39,574
- i'd really like to talk.
- This first. It's a hoot.

241
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:43,847
If you were on a desert island
with one meal,

242
00:16:44,131 --> 00:16:46,770
one aria and one bottle of wine,
what would they be?

243
00:16:47,053 --> 00:16:49,362
- Niles, i really...
- frasier.

244
00:16:49,642 --> 00:16:51,678
Ok.

245
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:55,609
A big mac,
"i'm your venus" and ripple.

246
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:01,857
If you're going to mock the game,
don't play.

247
00:17:02,167 --> 00:17:06,160
- Gladly.
- Are you still cramped up about age?

248
00:17:06,508 --> 00:17:09,227
No, i'm fine. By the way, you were right.

249
00:17:09,514 --> 00:17:11,550
Oh, i love to hear that.

250
00:17:11,811 --> 00:17:16,441
Yes, but i do have a problem.
The other day i was asked out by, er,

251
00:17:16,821 --> 00:17:19,494
this 22-year-old girl
that i met in the mall.

252
00:17:19,786 --> 00:17:22,175
- That is alarming.
- I turned her down.

253
00:17:22,457 --> 00:17:24,812
In a mall? Did anyone see you?

254
00:17:26,131 --> 00:17:29,043
Niles. I'm just wondering
if i made the right decision.

255
00:17:29,346 --> 00:17:33,385
I would love to go out with this girl.
She's fantastic.

256
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:37,882
But i could look like some old fool
chasing after a young girl,

257
00:17:38,239 --> 00:17:41,868
becoming a walking midlife crisis cliché,

258
00:17:42,205 --> 00:17:45,436
running around
like that buffoon stanley barrister.

259
00:17:45,754 --> 00:17:51,033
- Oh, that is embarrassing.
- That girl, how old can she be?

260
00:17:51,432 --> 00:17:53,468
- 21, if she's a day.
- Frightening!

261
00:17:53,728 --> 00:17:56,640
I saw them last tuesday night together.

262
00:17:56,943 --> 00:18:02,017
- I saw them wednesday morning.
- ew!

263
00:18:02,412 --> 00:18:06,530
- That's disgusting!
- People will say the same about me!

264
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,156
Stanley barrister is a 60-year-old man

265
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:12,426
who wears a toupee
that looks like something

266
00:18:12,683 --> 00:18:14,958
he pulled out of a shower drain.

267
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:19,580
You are 41
and obviously not wearing a toupee.

268
00:18:22,035 --> 00:18:23,991
Thank you, niles.

269
00:18:24,247 --> 00:18:27,557
- You think it's ok for me to date her?
- It doesn't matter.

270
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:31,236
- I value your opinion.
- It's irrelevant.

271
00:18:31,553 --> 00:18:34,625
Don't be coy,
and please stop pursing your lips.

272
00:18:34,936 --> 00:18:38,895
You look like one of those old women
they carve out of dried apples.

273
00:18:41,281 --> 00:18:47,754
Don't you see? What i think about you
dating a younger woman is immaterial.

274
00:18:48,212 --> 00:18:50,680
- What matters is what you think.
- Hm...

275
00:18:50,968 --> 00:18:54,438
would you be doing it
to run away from your age

276
00:18:54,767 --> 00:18:58,362
or because
this could become a relationship?

277
00:18:59,694 --> 00:19:02,254
- I don't know.
- Find out.

278
00:19:02,532 --> 00:19:05,649
- Then to hell with what people think.
- You are right.

279
00:19:05,956 --> 00:19:09,346
Oh! There it is again.
I never tire of hearing that.

280
00:19:09,672 --> 00:19:12,425
Let the tongues
of the doubting nabobs wag.

281
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,871
- If it feels right, make yourself happy.
- Thank you.

282
00:19:16,185 --> 00:19:22,055
On a desert island, what would be
your favourite meal, aria and wine?

283
00:19:22,489 --> 00:19:26,038
The coulibiac of salmon at guy savoy,
"vissi d'arte" from tosca,

284
00:19:26,371 --> 00:19:29,841
and the cotes du rhone
chateauneuf du pape '47.

285
00:19:31,215 --> 00:19:34,048
You are so predictable.

286
00:19:43,405 --> 00:19:47,523
- Carrie, hi.
- Hi. I didn't expect to see you here.

287
00:19:47,873 --> 00:19:52,503
I could say i came down to shop,
but i came to see you.

288
00:19:52,883 --> 00:19:55,443
That's great.
I've been thinking about you.

289
00:19:55,722 --> 00:20:00,477
Me, too. I wanted to chat
about why we shouldn't go out.

290
00:20:00,857 --> 00:20:04,372
- Ok.
- I thought i was in a midlife crisis.

291
00:20:04,698 --> 00:20:10,375
I was afraid if i dated you,
i would be trying to recapture my youth.

292
00:20:10,794 --> 00:20:15,822
I thought i asked you out
only because i was trying to work out

293
00:20:16,221 --> 00:20:20,373
some unresolved issues
about my father or something.

294
00:20:20,731 --> 00:20:23,450
So i went back and forth.
I felt like a fool...

295
00:20:23,737 --> 00:20:25,853
me, too, back and forth.

296
00:20:26,116 --> 00:20:31,065
- Maybe you came along to fill a need.
- Or this could be something serious.

297
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:36,454
Exactly. So, well,
i asked myself a few tough questions.

298
00:20:36,846 --> 00:20:39,838
- Me, too.
- I finally came to a decision.

299
00:20:40,144 --> 00:20:43,261
Me, too. I think us going out
would have been really stupid.

300
00:20:43,567 --> 00:20:46,081
Me, too!

301
00:20:48,035 --> 00:20:52,506
You and i would never have been
on a very firm footing.

302
00:20:52,878 --> 00:20:57,474
You knew all that, but you just
let me figure it out for myself.

303
00:20:57,846 --> 00:21:02,044
Yes, i'm sort of like the wizard of oz.

304
00:21:03,565 --> 00:21:07,353
It's no wonder everybody listens
to your radio show. You're so smart.

305
00:21:09,619 --> 00:21:11,610
Actually, i am full of crap.

306
00:21:12,793 --> 00:21:16,388
I had no idea you might be grappling
with personal issues.

307
00:21:16,717 --> 00:21:19,675
Some psychiatrist, huh?

308
00:21:19,974 --> 00:21:23,853
The truth is i came down here
to try to talk you into going out with me.

309
00:21:24,232 --> 00:21:27,030
I guess it's still a pretty bad idea.

310
00:21:27,322 --> 00:21:29,438
You're being so honest with me.

311
00:21:29,701 --> 00:21:33,296
That is such
an attractive quality in a man.

312
00:21:37,634 --> 00:21:41,752
Well, you know,
let's not go down that road again.

313
00:21:42,101 --> 00:21:43,693
Ok.

314
00:21:45,441 --> 00:21:47,557
See you around.

315
00:21:49,491 --> 00:21:51,800
Bye.

316
00:22:05,356 --> 00:22:09,429
# Hey, baby, i hear the blues a-calling
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

317
00:22:10,491 --> 00:22:12,163
# quite stylish

318
00:22:12,412 --> 00:22:18,203
# maybe i seem a bit confused
yeah, maybe... but i got you pegged!

319
00:22:19,592 --> 00:22:23,267
# But i don't know what to do with those
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

320
00:22:26,481 --> 00:22:28,790
# they're calling again

321
00:22:29,362 --> 00:22:33,913
# scrambled eggs all over my face
what is a boy to do? #

322
00:22:36,084 --> 00:22:37,358
good night!
