1
00:00:07,595 --> 00:00:10,712
No, i've never had a serious boyfriend.

2
00:00:11,018 --> 00:00:13,054
No one's really been interested.

3
00:00:13,313 --> 00:00:16,111
Men can be such pigs.

4
00:00:16,402 --> 00:00:18,393
People did try to fix me up.

5
00:00:18,655 --> 00:00:23,365
In manchester, me mum was steering
me towards the butcher's son.

6
00:00:23,747 --> 00:00:26,898
Pasty little thing, didn't fancy him.

7
00:00:27,211 --> 00:00:30,760
I suppose i like my gents
more on the manly side.

8
00:00:34,974 --> 00:00:37,090
Was that a little swan you made?

9
00:00:37,352 --> 00:00:39,388
No, it was a b-52.

10
00:00:43,446 --> 00:00:47,485
Dr jennings rang.
Dad skipped his physical again!

11
00:00:47,828 --> 00:00:51,616
No wonder he didn't want me
to go with him.

12
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,032
You know dad's aversion to doctors.

13
00:00:55,341 --> 00:00:57,377
Why didn't you take him?

14
00:00:57,636 --> 00:01:01,675
I had my "fear of abandonment"
workshop. I've already skipped twice.

15
00:01:03,687 --> 00:01:05,678
Wait till your father gets here.

16
00:01:05,942 --> 00:01:08,456
I'll give him a piece of my mind.

17
00:01:13,371 --> 00:01:17,489
If only we knew
when he was about to arrive.

18
00:01:17,837 --> 00:01:19,748
Hey!

19
00:01:21,592 --> 00:01:25,028
How you doing, boy?
I'm glad to see you, too.

20
00:01:25,348 --> 00:01:28,977
- How was your exam?
- Pretty routine.

21
00:01:29,313 --> 00:01:30,951
- Ekg?
- Perfect.

22
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:33,659
- Blood pressure?
- Textbook.

23
00:01:33,946 --> 00:01:35,425
Full blood panel?

24
00:01:35,657 --> 00:01:38,012
I told them to take two -
they're small.

25
00:01:38,328 --> 00:01:40,717
Oh, let's give a look.

26
00:01:42,544 --> 00:01:44,535
Oh, look at this!

27
00:01:44,797 --> 00:01:48,233
A nice big band-aid!
Nice try.

28
00:01:50,265 --> 00:01:52,221
What'd you do that for?

29
00:01:52,477 --> 00:01:57,028
Dr jennings' office said
you hadn't shown up today.

30
00:01:57,401 --> 00:01:59,961
Why do you avoid the doctor?

31
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:04,232
Because i feel fine.
And i don't like dr jennings.

32
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:08,573
He's got a model of a colon on his desk.
He keeps his tongue depressors in it.

33
00:02:12,468 --> 00:02:15,426
All right, dad.
Why don't you see my doctor?

34
00:02:15,723 --> 00:02:21,275
- She's one of the finest in seattle.
- She? No, no, no way.

35
00:02:21,691 --> 00:02:23,647
If a doctor's
going to have me bend over,

36
00:02:23,903 --> 00:02:26,292
i want to look through
my legs and see wing tips.

37
00:02:28,954 --> 00:02:33,744
Women have been poked and prodded
by male doctors for centuries.

38
00:02:34,129 --> 00:02:38,088
I say it's high time
you gents went to a woman doctor.

39
00:02:38,427 --> 00:02:43,660
See how you like waiting all naked
and helpless and goose-bumpy.

40
00:02:44,062 --> 00:02:45,780
Niles, recommend someone.

41
00:02:47,609 --> 00:02:49,565
Niles!

42
00:02:52,534 --> 00:02:55,606
I'm sorry,
my mind was somewhere else.

43
00:02:55,914 --> 00:02:59,111
Oh, i know who you should see!
Dr gary newman!

44
00:02:59,421 --> 00:03:03,539
He's very successful. I saw
a lichtenstein hanging in his office.

45
00:03:03,886 --> 00:03:06,036
A lichtenstein? He sounds perfect.

46
00:03:06,307 --> 00:03:09,743
Ok. I'll make an appointment.

47
00:03:10,062 --> 00:03:14,180
Just hang on a second.
I will escort you personally.

48
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:18,760
- Wonderful, i can't wait.
- Stop grumbling. It won't be so bad.

49
00:03:19,119 --> 00:03:21,269
Unless you have to parade
around the office

50
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:25,658
in one of those gowns
where your bum peaks through.

51
00:03:26,006 --> 00:03:27,962
What's dr newman's number?

52
00:03:29,011 --> 00:03:30,239
Niles... niles!

53
00:03:31,891 --> 00:03:34,644
Sorry, i must have drifted off again.

54
00:03:38,026 --> 00:03:42,816
My appointment was meant to be
half an hour ago. Let's get out of here.

55
00:03:43,201 --> 00:03:46,876
Relax. Read a magazine.
Here, take the cosmo quiz.

56
00:03:50,421 --> 00:03:53,219
"Are your nipples sensitive?"

57
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:57,631
Do it quietly.
It's not an oral exam.

58
00:03:57,934 --> 00:04:00,926
You haven't seen the second question.

59
00:04:02,315 --> 00:04:04,465
Did you keep your patients waiting?

60
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:07,773
Just the compulsives.
It was part of their therapy.

61
00:04:08,994 --> 00:04:11,349
Relax, i'll take care of it.

62
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:21,102
My father had an appointment
30 minutes ago.

63
00:04:21,431 --> 00:04:24,548
The doctor's running late.
You'll be first when he gets in.

64
00:04:24,853 --> 00:04:27,845
Where's he coming from, spokane?

65
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:31,028
From lake chelan.

66
00:04:31,322 --> 00:04:34,200
Lake chelan? Ooh!
This guy must be terrific.

67
00:04:35,245 --> 00:04:38,123
- So?
- He'll be here any minute.

68
00:04:42,089 --> 00:04:45,240
I was just struck by
one of life's little ironies,

69
00:04:45,553 --> 00:04:49,512
i remember you taking me to the doctor
and here i am taking you.

70
00:04:49,852 --> 00:04:53,970
Like when i took you
for your first tetanus shot.

71
00:04:54,318 --> 00:04:57,435
I was scared.
I remember you holding my hand.

72
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:00,493
You bent over, dropped your drawers.

73
00:05:00,787 --> 00:05:05,224
You took your mind off the shot by
reciting the names of puccini's operas.

74
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:10,499
Right then,
i knew you'd never be a cop.

75
00:05:12,932 --> 00:05:14,923
I'm serious, let's go!

76
00:05:15,186 --> 00:05:18,815
I'll check if there's someone
substituting for him.

77
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:23,373
What are you here for?

78
00:05:23,616 --> 00:05:28,167
Oh, lately, i've been having
this overall sluggish feeling.

79
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:34,411
It's hard even getting out of bed,
not to mention the cold weather.

80
00:05:34,844 --> 00:05:37,802
It's really making my joints hurt.

81
00:05:38,099 --> 00:05:42,615
I've started to notice
flaking spots on my skin.

82
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,885
What about you?

83
00:05:48,073 --> 00:05:50,587
I have sensitive nipples.

84
00:05:55,502 --> 00:05:59,381
The doctor won't be able
to make your appointment today.

85
00:05:59,718 --> 00:06:03,870
Great! These big shot doctors
keep you waiting for an hour

86
00:06:04,225 --> 00:06:06,580
and then they don't even show up.

87
00:06:06,854 --> 00:06:11,530
Played a little slow on the golf course?
Arrogant jerk!

88
00:06:11,905 --> 00:06:16,421
Dad, dad, dad. Dr newman is dead.
He died an hour ago.

89
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:22,522
I'm sure he was a good man.

90
00:06:25,928 --> 00:06:29,682
He walks down his walkway,
he picks up his newspaper,

91
00:06:30,017 --> 00:06:33,293
and bang,
he drops dead of a heart attack.

92
00:06:33,607 --> 00:06:35,757
I pick up my newspaper every day,

93
00:06:36,027 --> 00:06:38,621
and "the sunday times" is very heavy.

94
00:06:38,907 --> 00:06:41,296
Well, these things happen.

95
00:06:41,578 --> 00:06:46,447
How can you say that?
He wasn't old! He was my age!

96
00:06:46,837 --> 00:06:51,592
What can i say? I don't think
about these things like you do.

97
00:06:51,971 --> 00:06:55,327
Maybe it's because
you're 41 and i'm not.

98
00:06:56,478 --> 00:06:59,515
Don't you ever think about dying?

99
00:06:59,817 --> 00:07:03,856
Well, not me dying. But you know
what i have thought of lately?

100
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:09,193
I've been dating this older guy
and what if... you know...

101
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:13,144
we were in bed and he dropped dead?

102
00:07:14,674 --> 00:07:18,428
It's a possibility.
Sometimes he starts breathing funny.

103
00:07:18,765 --> 00:07:23,202
I don't know if he's having
a good time or if i've overexcited him.

104
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,597
Someone has
a very high opinion of herself.

105
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:30,863
Everybody's good at something.

106
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:35,589
Why is it that every time we talk,
we end up talking about your sex life?

107
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,951
Because i have one.

108
00:07:46,852 --> 00:07:49,047
Thank you for coming.

109
00:07:49,315 --> 00:07:51,909
- Hello.
- Hello, dr crane.

110
00:07:52,195 --> 00:07:57,315
I was in the middle of my workout,
but i can always pump iron later.

111
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:02,791
I'll just fix us a snack.

112
00:08:04,674 --> 00:08:06,630
"Pump iron" (!)

113
00:08:06,885 --> 00:08:09,638
Niles, you don't even
pump your own gas.

114
00:08:11,268 --> 00:08:13,224
All right.

115
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,392
What's this about getting
your affairs in order?

116
00:08:16,694 --> 00:08:20,448
Dr newman dying so young
threw me for a loop.

117
00:08:20,783 --> 00:08:25,254
I realised i hadn't made the
proper provisions for my own death.

118
00:08:25,624 --> 00:08:27,933
Here we go.

119
00:08:29,715 --> 00:08:31,671
- Allow me.
- Thanks.

120
00:08:35,058 --> 00:08:37,014
I've prepared copies for you,

121
00:08:37,269 --> 00:08:42,104
the location and numbers of my bank
accounts, my safety deposit keys,

122
00:08:42,486 --> 00:08:46,525
the number for my attorney...
niles, what are you doing?

123
00:08:46,868 --> 00:08:48,824
Oh, give me that!

124
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:53,639
I loosened it for him.

125
00:08:54,672 --> 00:08:57,630
Now, my personal possessions.

126
00:08:57,928 --> 00:08:59,998
This is for family only.

127
00:09:00,265 --> 00:09:03,337
Please stay. I'll come to you later.

128
00:09:03,646 --> 00:09:07,116
Dad, niles, put your names
on these stickers

129
00:09:07,444 --> 00:09:12,040
and place them on the objects
you would like bequeathed to you.

130
00:09:13,621 --> 00:09:16,010
I'm not putting my name on your stuff!

131
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:21,081
What if i die tomorrow?
You will argue over that african mask.

132
00:09:21,467 --> 00:09:25,506
It'll never happen.
Niles, you can have it.

133
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:28,318
I don't want it.

134
00:09:29,689 --> 00:09:34,285
Don't look at me. I throw a towel
over it when you're not home.

135
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:38,953
Ok, fine.

136
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:43,243
Well, now we come
to the issue of... my remains.

137
00:09:43,587 --> 00:09:47,978
- Oh, jeez!
- It's all here in this easy-to-read binder.

138
00:09:48,344 --> 00:09:50,858
This is taking it too far!
Look at this!

139
00:09:51,141 --> 00:09:55,214
Burial... casket... caterers?

140
00:09:55,565 --> 00:09:57,635
- Who are you using?
- Michaelson's.

141
00:09:57,902 --> 00:09:59,972
They're very good.

142
00:10:01,074 --> 00:10:03,588
- Bowtie pasta...
- and the asparagus tips...

143
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:07,704
excuse me! Excuse me!
Are we done?

144
00:10:08,044 --> 00:10:12,959
There is just one more duck
to put in the row.

145
00:10:13,344 --> 00:10:18,179
I've discovered that most
unexpected deaths occur in the home.

146
00:10:18,561 --> 00:10:22,839
Daphne, this is where you come in,
the actual finding of the body.

147
00:10:24,237 --> 00:10:27,673
Oh, save the best part for me, eh?

148
00:10:27,993 --> 00:10:31,349
That's all right.
As a health-care provider,

149
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:34,339
i've had my share of patients die on me.

150
00:10:34,629 --> 00:10:37,223
That's a comfort.

151
00:10:37,509 --> 00:10:39,545
Maybe we should drop the subject.

152
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:44,925
This has made me feel better.
I can handle my mortality better now.

153
00:10:45,313 --> 00:10:47,747
Enough about death!

154
00:10:48,026 --> 00:10:51,735
Let's celebrate life
with this chateau certan '75!

155
00:10:52,075 --> 00:10:56,193
No, not the '75.
That's too good for the likes of us.

156
00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:00,579
Perhaps a beaujolais nouveau
would be more appropriate.

157
00:11:18,786 --> 00:11:20,822
Eddie?

158
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,514
Oh, there you are. Come on, boy.

159
00:11:26,965 --> 00:11:29,638
Frasier, what are you
still doing up?

160
00:11:29,929 --> 00:11:32,124
Frasier!

161
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:36,145
Dad, please, shh.
I'm trying to listen to my heartbeat.

162
00:11:38,318 --> 00:11:43,438
It's amazing, it can pump 1,800
gallons of blood each and every day

163
00:11:43,827 --> 00:11:48,947
but just a tiny tear in the tiniest artery,
and poof you're gone.

164
00:11:49,336 --> 00:11:51,691
I thought you were ok about this.

165
00:11:51,965 --> 00:11:55,162
So did i.
What is the matter with me?

166
00:11:55,471 --> 00:11:57,621
I thought that putting my affairs in order

167
00:11:57,891 --> 00:12:00,451
would help me
to deal with this, but it hasn't.

168
00:12:00,729 --> 00:12:06,486
I can't seem to get over the feeling
that something could happen to me.

169
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:10,753
Jeez, i'd miss so much.

170
00:12:11,038 --> 00:12:14,394
I'd never get to see my son
hit his first home run.

171
00:12:14,711 --> 00:12:18,306
That'd be a terrible thing
for a father to miss.

172
00:12:18,634 --> 00:12:21,148
Tell me about it.

173
00:12:24,101 --> 00:12:26,820
Look, let me tell you something.

174
00:12:27,106 --> 00:12:29,062
There was this time, a while back,

175
00:12:29,319 --> 00:12:32,356
seven or eight of us
were on this drug bust.

176
00:12:32,657 --> 00:12:37,447
We went through the front door
and the first guy took one, he died.

177
00:12:37,832 --> 00:12:42,428
When you're a cop,
you've got to handle things like that,

178
00:12:42,798 --> 00:12:45,551
but i just couldn't get over it.

179
00:12:45,845 --> 00:12:49,884
Every time i had to go
in a dark building, i froze.

180
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:54,141
I knew if i kept being afraid,
i'd never be able to do my job.

181
00:12:54,485 --> 00:12:59,081
- So what did you do?
- I forced myself to forget it.

182
00:12:59,451 --> 00:13:03,239
Next time i came to one of those doors,
i went right through it!

183
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:07,576
The fact that i got shot in the hip
was purely coincidental.

184
00:13:11,096 --> 00:13:13,166
You were this close
to helping me.

185
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:18,439
Just because some doctor dies
doesn't mean you will.

186
00:13:18,775 --> 00:13:22,529
Yeah, but he was just like me,
highly educated, sophisticated.

187
00:13:22,866 --> 00:13:27,064
I saw his picture in a medical journal.
He even looked like me.

188
00:13:27,414 --> 00:13:32,727
Same determined chin, sweater vest,
ever so slightly receding hairline.

189
00:13:33,132 --> 00:13:35,805
You don't know his medical history.

190
00:13:36,095 --> 00:13:40,088
Actually, you're onto
something there, dad. Yeah...

191
00:13:40,436 --> 00:13:44,475
he could've had high blood pressure,
popped pills, drank like a fish.

192
00:13:44,818 --> 00:13:46,888
Yeah, could be anything.

193
00:13:47,155 --> 00:13:49,225
I'll find out what caused
his heart attack.

194
00:13:49,492 --> 00:13:51,960
Then i can disassociate
myself from him.

195
00:13:52,247 --> 00:13:55,762
There must be some explanation.

196
00:13:56,086 --> 00:13:58,554
That's great, dad.
I feel better now.

197
00:13:58,841 --> 00:14:01,719
You've got something
on your bathrobe.

198
00:14:05,352 --> 00:14:07,104
"Niles".

199
00:14:14,492 --> 00:14:16,642
The vultures are circling.

200
00:14:17,747 --> 00:14:19,703
Come on, eddie.

201
00:14:27,973 --> 00:14:29,725
 

202
00:14:30,894 --> 00:14:32,771
hello.

203
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:38,188
I called earlier. Someone said
mrs newman would be here.

204
00:14:38,532 --> 00:14:42,366
Please, come in. I'm allen freedman.
Gary was my cousin.

205
00:14:42,705 --> 00:14:45,583
Dr frasier crane. My condolences.

206
00:14:45,876 --> 00:14:48,595
I didn't know
mrs newman had company.

207
00:14:48,881 --> 00:14:51,236
- It's shivah.
- Excuse me?

208
00:14:51,511 --> 00:14:55,265
It's the jewish version of a wake.

209
00:14:55,602 --> 00:14:57,558
Oh, yes, of course.

210
00:14:57,813 --> 00:15:01,726
- I didn't realise gary was jewish.
- You're kidding?

211
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:07,098
We did spend a lot of time together.
Never on friday nights, of course.

212
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:11,247
This is a bad time.

213
00:15:11,502 --> 00:15:15,575
Jill would love to know you came.
She's right over there.

214
00:15:15,927 --> 00:15:21,160
- She looks busy. Well, i can wait.
- Will you excuse me?

215
00:15:35,626 --> 00:15:37,582
May i help you?

216
00:15:38,965 --> 00:15:43,083
Oh, this is a mirror. I thought maybe
you were having an unveiling later.

217
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:46,945
You're not jewish, are you?

218
00:15:48,897 --> 00:15:52,207
No, no, my ex-wife is, though,

219
00:15:52,529 --> 00:15:57,922
and thus my son is, which makes me
sort of, well... no, i'm not jewish.

220
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:01,800
We always cover mirrors at a shivah

221
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:06,041
so those grieving don't have to be
concerned with their appearances.

222
00:16:06,969 --> 00:16:09,403
Well, you look very nice.

223
00:16:09,682 --> 00:16:13,152
Oh, thank you.
It's been driving me crazy.

224
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:20,184
- I'm bobbie, gary's aunt.
- Dr frasier crane. My sympathies.

225
00:16:20,575 --> 00:16:23,009
The doctor with the radio show?

226
00:16:23,288 --> 00:16:26,485
- Did you know gary well?
- Oh, well. Yes, i did.

227
00:16:26,793 --> 00:16:30,422
There was so much more
i wanted to know about the man.

228
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:34,638
I don't know... eh...
how was his health before he died?

229
00:16:34,973 --> 00:16:38,170
- Excellent, he was never sick.
- Heart disease?

230
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:43,315
- High blood pressure or cholesterol?
- No.

231
00:16:43,696 --> 00:16:46,449
I'm sorry,
i'm asking too many questions.

232
00:16:46,743 --> 00:16:49,496
We doctors are always looking
for the answers.

233
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:54,003
- Oh, gail!
- Aunt bobbie!

234
00:16:54,297 --> 00:16:55,650
I know, i know.

235
00:16:57,844 --> 00:17:02,360
I'd like you to meet a friend of gary's,
dr frasier crane.

236
00:17:02,727 --> 00:17:04,922
Dr crane? From the radio?

237
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:08,341
Yes. I'm sorry for your loss.

238
00:17:08,654 --> 00:17:11,122
I love your show!

239
00:17:11,409 --> 00:17:17,041
Oh, i'm sorry. When i went to pick up
this linzer torte, i thought of gary and...

240
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:20,691
so gary liked fattening desserts?

241
00:17:21,008 --> 00:17:26,241
Oh, no. If he knew
i brought this here, he'd kill me.

242
00:17:26,642 --> 00:17:29,679
Gary was a health fanatic.
A vegetarian.

243
00:17:29,981 --> 00:17:31,937
We played basketball every sunday.

244
00:17:32,192 --> 00:17:34,547
So he was sedentary all week

245
00:17:34,822 --> 00:17:38,292
and then burning up
the court on sundays?

246
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:43,057
No, he played four times a week
if he wasn't at the gym working out.

247
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:48,733
- Gary was in phenomenal shape.
- Didn't smoke, never touched coffee.

248
00:17:49,137 --> 00:17:51,446
He had less than 10% body fat.

249
00:17:51,725 --> 00:17:55,764
My goodness, has anybody
checked to see if he's really dead?

250
00:18:01,199 --> 00:18:05,989
I'm... i'm sure they did check.
Those people are very thorough.

251
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:10,573
Oh, my, is that kugel? Excuse me.

252
00:18:21,858 --> 00:18:27,251
Mrs newman. I'm dr frasier crane.
I was a friend of your husband's.

253
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:31,050
- Dr crane! From...
- yes, the radio.

254
00:18:31,374 --> 00:18:35,765
- Gary never mentioned you.
- Well, we weren't actually friends.

255
00:18:36,132 --> 00:18:38,805
He had an office
in my brother's building.

256
00:18:39,095 --> 00:18:41,484
You took the time to come here!

257
00:18:41,766 --> 00:18:45,475
His own partner
stayed only 15 minutes.

258
00:18:45,814 --> 00:18:49,727
Well, there is a reason
i came to talk to you.

259
00:18:50,071 --> 00:18:53,063
- Which is?
- It's about gary.

260
00:18:54,245 --> 00:18:57,317
- About how he...
- yes?

261
00:19:00,464 --> 00:19:03,740
I'm sorry i bothered you.
I just came to offer my sympathies.

262
00:19:04,052 --> 00:19:05,804
No, wait, um...

263
00:19:07,641 --> 00:19:09,597
dr crane...

264
00:19:09,854 --> 00:19:14,803
i listen to you all the time and...
well, maybe you could help me.

265
00:19:18,869 --> 00:19:21,383
What would you tell
someone who called in

266
00:19:21,665 --> 00:19:24,498
and said they can't get over
why someone died?

267
00:19:24,796 --> 00:19:28,391
I keep running this over and over
in my mind

268
00:19:28,718 --> 00:19:32,791
and i just can't understand
how someone like gary,

269
00:19:33,142 --> 00:19:37,055
who did everything right,
can just die.

270
00:19:37,399 --> 00:19:40,835
I can't make any sense of it.

271
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:45,707
Mrs newman...

272
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:50,999
i know you'd like me to come up with
an answer to this whole thing,

273
00:19:51,339 --> 00:19:53,295
but i don't have one.

274
00:19:53,551 --> 00:19:58,750
Someone who consumes
cigarettes and burgers can live to be 83

275
00:19:59,144 --> 00:20:03,740
and then someone who takes care
of himself can die at 41.

276
00:20:05,362 --> 00:20:08,752
It's unfair.
Well, there's no explanation for it.

277
00:20:09,076 --> 00:20:11,829
Believe me, i've checked.

278
00:20:14,127 --> 00:20:17,278
But i suppose the best we can do

279
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:23,143
is live for the little joys and surprises
that life affords us.

280
00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:27,632
You can't spend your life
being obsessed with death.

281
00:20:27,983 --> 00:20:30,816
You're not jewish, are you?

282
00:20:35,036 --> 00:20:37,675
No, i'm not, but...

283
00:20:37,957 --> 00:20:41,074
well, thank you
for letting me be here today.

284
00:20:41,379 --> 00:20:43,609
Thank you for coming, dr crane.

285
00:20:48,683 --> 00:20:50,594
Oh, dr crane!

286
00:20:50,854 --> 00:20:53,209
It was very nice what you said

287
00:20:53,483 --> 00:20:58,113
about living life for the little
joys and surprises it can give us.

288
00:20:58,491 --> 00:21:01,881
- Yes.
- Thank you.

289
00:21:02,206 --> 00:21:06,324
- If only i believed it myself.
- Excuse me.

290
00:21:06,672 --> 00:21:10,221
Um, this is clearly
the most inappropriate thing

291
00:21:10,553 --> 00:21:12,509
i've ever done in my life,

292
00:21:12,765 --> 00:21:14,960
but i was watching you

293
00:21:15,227 --> 00:21:18,981
and i don't know if i'll ever
get the chance to see you again...

294
00:21:19,317 --> 00:21:22,673
and something about you
tells me i'd like to.

295
00:21:26,413 --> 00:21:31,441
If you'd like to get together
sometime, give me a call.

296
00:21:43,357 --> 00:21:45,234
# Baby, i hear the blues a-calling

297
00:21:45,485 --> 00:21:47,953
# tossed salads and scrambled eggs

298
00:21:49,326 --> 00:21:50,281
# mercy!

299
00:21:50,493 --> 00:21:52,563
# Maybe i seem i bit confused

300
00:21:52,831 --> 00:21:55,345
# well, maybe... but i got you pegged!

301
00:21:57,631 --> 00:21:59,508
# But i don't know what to do with those

302
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:02,478
# tossed salads and scrambled eggs

303
00:22:03,557 --> 00:22:04,751
# they're calling again #

304
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:08,768
frasier has left the building.
