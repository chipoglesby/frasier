Uh, You got the case of Montrachet?
Good. Good.

And the Thanksgiving feast
will be delivered promptly at 3?

Excellent. Thank you.

All right, now,
when you mist the plants,

I know I'm harping on and on about this,

I'll show you around the kitchen.

24

like a woman all the time?

Oh, yeah. I know, son, it's hard.

30

Remember the year I plopped
that big wedge of pumpkin pie

31
00:01:40,607 --> 00:01:43,599
in front of her, and we all laughed?

32
00:01:44,167 --> 00:01:46,476
Then I put a big scoop
of whipped cream on top of it,

33
00:01:46,647 --> 00:01:48,717
and we laughed some more.

She didn't wanna spend

Her husband is in New Zealand,
exploring a volcano.

- Because if she accidentally fell in,

the shock wave from the hottest thing
in nature meeting the coldest

would actually crack the Earth in two.

couldn't freeze Mercury.

When he's really bugging me,
I ask if he hasn't lost a little weight.

Before you know it,

in the glass at the candy machine.

What else?

- Hi, Daddy.
- In a minute, Frederick.

306
00:15:45,327 --> 00:15:47,283
God, it was right in front of us,
and we missed it.

307
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:50,678
- We didn't even see it.
- How could we be so blind?

308
00:15:50,887 --> 00:15:53,720
Maybe we should get ourselves back
there and give him what he wants.

309
00:15:53,887 --> 00:15:56,879
Right. We can't let anything stand
in the way of our son's welfare.

Ah, Dr Sternin and Dr Crane.

Forgive me if I don't give you
a big hello hug,

00:16:17,127 --> 00:16:19,243
but as you can see,
I'm wearing this greasy apron.

315
00:16:19,447 --> 00:16:22,564
On top of which, I'm beginning
to loathe the sight of both of you.

316
00:16:22,767 --> 00:16:24,325
All the more reason for us to be brief.

317

Yes, I'm sure you'll be on your way just
as soon as you've found the cufflink

given to you by Haile Selassie.

No false pretence this time.

320
00:16:35,567 --> 00:16:39,958
We know that with so many qualified
applicants and only one position open

321
00:16:40,127 --> 00:16:42,595
that your decision
must be very difficult.

322
00:16:42,807 --> 00:16:45,401
Yes. And so,
in the spirit of the holidays,

to your Pilgrims' table,

we bring this little bit of garnish,
as it were,

325

in the hopes that our relationship
may flower.

326
00:16:57,127 --> 00:17:00,642
I'll have you know that, in 22 years,
I have never accepted a bribe.

327
00:17:00,807 --> 00:17:03,275
I have to tell you
that I find this utterly offensive...

328
00:17:03,447 --> 00:17:05,722
...in every possible way.

329
00:17:08,207 --> 00:17:10,163
Now, if you don't mind,
I have guests on the way

330
00:17:10,327 --> 00:17:14,639

veterinarian could still save him.

"I have a fully cooked turkey"
in the breast pocket of that blazer,

is at an end.

I'm particularly grateful

338
00:18:29,967 --> 00:18:33,164
that finally you've been able
to set aside your differences

Well, as angry as I was
that you admitted Regan into Marbury

00:18:42,167 --> 00:18:44,601
instead of our Wesley,
it's all worked out for the best.

Wesley is thriving
at the Barkley School.

I'm delighted to hear it.

345

Oh, I have a dusty bottle
of Chateau Lafitte in the cellar

Yes, he's just gone to the cellar
to get a bottle of wine.

Don't mean to intrude,
but we heard

00:19:20,047 --> 00:19:22,436
he was having trouble with his turkey,
thought we'd drop this by.

is probably stretching it just a tad.

You see, our son
was a candidate for Marbury,
