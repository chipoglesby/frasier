1
00:00:10,087 --> 00:00:11,645
Well, that's our show for today.

2
00:00:11,807 --> 00:00:13,718
But before we close,
I'd like to invite you all

3
00:00:13,887 --> 00:00:16,924
to join us here at KACL
in wishing a fond farewell

4
00:00:17,087 --> 00:00:22,366
to our Happy Chef, Leo Pascale,
as he bubble-wraps his crepe pan

5
00:00:22,527 --> 00:00:24,961
and heads south
towards sunny Santa Fe.

6
00:00:25,327 --> 00:00:29,400
Leo, you stirred us
with your passion...

7
00:00:29,607 --> 00:00:33,236
...melted us with your charm,
added spice to our lives.

8
00:00:33,407 --> 00:00:37,446
Now, as you whisk yourself away...

9
00:00:37,647 --> 00:00:42,038
...let's not say goodbye,
but rather tartare for now.

10
00:00:43,887 --> 00:00:47,243
This is Dr Frasier Crane, KACL 780.

11
00:00:47,407 --> 00:00:51,844
Well, at least you stopped short
of saying, "I'll be fricasseeing you."

12
00:00:52,727 --> 00:00:53,921
You ready to go to Leo's party?

13
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:55,998
Oh, dear God,
there is nothing I detest more

14
00:00:56,167 --> 00:00:58,522
than a KACL goodbye party.

15
00:00:58,687 --> 00:01:00,040
They're all the same.

16
00:01:00,207 --> 00:01:03,244
Twist-top wine and a bunch of people
standing around awkwardly,

17
00:01:03,407 --> 00:01:06,240
trying to summon up some affection
for someone they hardly even know.

18
00:01:06,407 --> 00:01:08,159
It always ends up
reeking of insincerity.

19
00:01:08,367 --> 00:01:12,326
What are we gonna do, doc?
He's leaving us.

20
00:01:12,487 --> 00:01:16,639
- Bulldog and Leo were tight.
- Well, Bulldog certainly is.

21
00:01:16,967 --> 00:01:20,846
I love that guy, man.
He'd give me all his leftovers.

22
00:01:21,047 --> 00:01:24,164
I warned Leo, you keep feeding him,
he'll keep coming back.

23
00:01:24,367 --> 00:01:26,961
- Are you going to the party?
- Actually, I think I'm gonna pass.

24
00:01:27,127 --> 00:01:29,595
Come on. Doc, you gotta at least
have a drink, give him a hug.

25
00:01:29,807 --> 00:01:31,445
That is precisely
what I'm trying to avoid.

26
00:01:31,607 --> 00:01:33,165
When did we become
a society of huggers?

27
00:01:33,367 --> 00:01:36,598
Oh, we hug for everything nowadays.
I mean, "Hello." Hug.

28
00:01:36,767 --> 00:01:39,645
"Congratulations." Hug.
"Nice haircut." Hug.

29
00:01:40,247 --> 00:01:41,396
It's absurd.

30
00:01:41,607 --> 00:01:43,996
I mean, if we want to express
some real emotion for someone,

31
00:01:44,167 --> 00:01:46,158
- where is there left to go?
- I've had good luck

32
00:01:46,327 --> 00:01:47,919
with the storage closet.

33
00:01:49,207 --> 00:01:51,198
You know, I think you're
way too uptight about this.

34
00:01:51,367 --> 00:01:52,686
No, no, no, I see the doc's point.

35
00:01:52,847 --> 00:01:55,042
We all have different ways
of saying goodbye.

36
00:01:55,207 --> 00:02:00,076
Me, I prefer this method.
Get out! Come on! I got a show to do.

37
00:02:01,607 --> 00:02:03,598
Well, I think hugging
is very healthy.

38
00:02:03,807 --> 00:02:06,116
I read somewhere
that if you have physical contact

39
00:02:06,287 --> 00:02:09,085
on a regular basis,
it can actually extend your life.

40
00:02:09,287 --> 00:02:12,563
Well, in that case,
you should outlive Styrofoam.

41
00:02:16,767 --> 00:02:19,645
- Frasier, you made it.
- Well, Leo, you know I wouldn't miss

42
00:02:19,807 --> 00:02:24,517
- saying goodbye to you for the world.
ROZ: We're gonna miss you so much.

43
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:28,402
We sure are. Oh, what the heck.

44
00:02:30,247 --> 00:02:34,479
You have no idea
how hard this is for me.

45
00:02:41,527 --> 00:02:42,801
FRASIER:
Thank you.

46
00:02:43,767 --> 00:02:46,235
I must say, Niles,
that is a striking tie you're wearing.

47
00:02:46,407 --> 00:02:47,999
Thank you. It was a gift from Maris.

48
00:02:48,207 --> 00:02:49,959
She had it made for me
to commemorate the end

49
00:02:50,127 --> 00:02:52,038
of that dreadful winter
she had her obesity scare.

50
00:02:52,207 --> 00:02:54,084
FRASIER:
Oh, yes.

51
00:02:54,847 --> 00:02:57,486
I remember her struggle
to lose that holiday pound.

52
00:02:57,647 --> 00:02:59,603
NILES:
Yes.

53
00:03:01,567 --> 00:03:04,559
After she'd restored her figure,
she had Yoshi set fire

54
00:03:04,727 --> 00:03:07,366
to a hippopotamus topiary
she felt had taunted her.

55
00:03:07,567 --> 00:03:08,966
Yeah.

56
00:03:09,167 --> 00:03:11,397
Then, as a visual reminder
never to let herself go again,

57
00:03:11,567 --> 00:03:15,845
she had this tie made for me out
of the legs of her fat pants. Thank you.

58
00:03:16,327 --> 00:03:19,285
You know, I would think
wearing a tie that Maris gave you

59
00:03:19,447 --> 00:03:21,722
might make you feel
a little bit melancholy.

60
00:03:22,007 --> 00:03:24,805
On the contrary. I have
every reason to believe Maris and I

61
00:03:24,967 --> 00:03:27,162
- may be on the road to reconciliation.
- Really?

62
00:03:27,327 --> 00:03:28,646
- We met for lunch today.
- Mm-hm.

63
00:03:28,807 --> 00:03:31,241
I told her I couldn't stand
being in separation limbo any more,

64
00:03:31,447 --> 00:03:33,039
and unless she wanted
the marriage to end,

65
00:03:33,207 --> 00:03:35,767
- we simply had to get into counselling.
- And she agreed?

66
00:03:35,967 --> 00:03:38,606
Her exact words were
"I'll think about it,"

67
00:03:38,767 --> 00:03:40,917
but I saw a twinkle
in her eye I have not seen

68
00:03:41,087 --> 00:03:44,796
since the neighbour children
discovered our new electric fence.

69
00:03:46,287 --> 00:03:49,006
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

70

- The foam is a tad listless today.
- Yes. I can tell without looking

back on steamer duty.

72
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:57,165
You are good.

73
00:03:57,367 --> 00:04:00,439
- Excuse me, Dr Niles Crane?
- I am.

74
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:01,960
- Here.
NILES: Oh.

75
00:04:03,247 --> 00:04:04,805
Who's sending me this?

76
00:04:04,967 --> 00:04:07,197
"Notice. Petition...

77
00:04:07,367 --> 00:04:11,406
...for divorce."
- Sorry, man. Cool tie.

78
00:04:13,087 --> 00:04:17,080
- I don't know what to say.
- Oh... It's all right.

Would have been nice if we'd given
therapy a try, but so be it.

It's little consolation,
but you're to be applauded

81
00:04:23,607 --> 00:04:25,802
for how you're handling this.
A lesser man would panic.

82
00:04:26,007 --> 00:04:28,362
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
I'll get her back.

83
00:04:29,327 --> 00:04:31,204
You have too much dignity
to let yourself beg.

Please give me my phone back.
Please. Please.

FRASIER:
Stop. Stop. Stop it!

86
00:04:36,287 --> 00:04:38,084
Listen, I know you're upset now,
but remember

87
00:04:38,247 --> 00:04:40,886
why you left Maris in the first place.
You were tired of grovelling.

88
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:43,043
Yes, but I'm rested now.

89
00:04:45,407 --> 00:04:46,635
Fine.

90
00:04:47,367 --> 00:04:49,323
Go ahead
and toddle on back to Maris.

91
00:04:49,527 --> 00:04:51,802
Let her grind you under her boot heel
for another 12 years,

92
00:04:51,967 --> 00:04:53,878
rob you of whatever self-respect
you've retained.

93
00:04:54,047 --> 00:04:56,845
Then we can have
this conversation all over again!

94
00:04:58,007 --> 00:05:01,443
- I was unhappy, wasn't I?
- You were miserable.

95
00:05:03,007 --> 00:05:04,884
I'm sorry.

96
00:05:05,047 --> 00:05:09,643
It's just a lot to take in.
Twelve years of my life, gone.

97

Oh, don't think of it as a loss,
but rather an opportunity for growth.

98

- It's not an ending, it's...
- Frasier.

If you don't mind, maybe we could
not talk about it for a while.

- Of course.
- Hi. Can I get you guys anything?

No, thank you.

You remember that outfit Mrs Foster
knitted Eddie for Christmas?

109
00:05:52,287 --> 00:05:53,720
Well, I bumped into her
in the lobby,

and she said she was gonna
be going to the park.

00:07:50,367 --> 00:07:51,800
You get over there
and take possession

151
00:07:51,967 --> 00:07:55,118
of your personal belongings before
they box them up and toss them out.

152
00:07:55,327 --> 00:07:58,046
When will you just admit
that this junk belongs in a dustbin?

153
00:07:58,247 --> 00:08:00,681
You know, I was on a case once
where the wife constantly nagged

154
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:03,236
the husband like this. "You never
put anything in the garbage.

155
00:08:03,407 --> 00:08:04,886
Why don't you put anything
in the garbage?"

156
00:08:05,047 --> 00:08:09,598
- Well, he should've listened to her.
- He did. That's where we found her.

157
00:08:12,047 --> 00:08:15,801
You know, I think Daphne's fighting an
uphill battle with this project of hers.

158
00:08:17,927 --> 00:08:20,361
- What's that?
- It's a journal.

159
00:08:20,527 --> 00:08:22,802
Look at this.

160
00:08:23,287 --> 00:08:24,800
Isn't that Mother's handwriting?

161
00:08:24,967 --> 00:08:28,516
These must be notes
from one of her research projects.

162
00:08:29,687 --> 00:08:33,362
"It's hard to imagine two male siblings
who could be more different

163
00:08:33,527 --> 00:08:34,846
than Frasier and Niles."

164
00:08:35,047 --> 00:08:36,799
Good heavens, it's about us.

165
00:08:37,007 --> 00:08:38,440
"Though both are highly intelligent,

166
00:08:38,607 --> 00:08:40,438
Frasier is clearly
the more dominant of the two,

167
00:08:40,607 --> 00:08:44,600
while Niles remains
extremely passive." Fascinating.

168
00:08:46,007 --> 00:08:48,760
"Frasier never seems to get
enough at mealtime.

169
00:08:48,967 --> 00:08:50,798
He's nearly twice the size of Niles,
and often,

170
00:08:50,967 --> 00:08:54,482
when he thinks I'm not looking,
steals his brother's food."

171
00:08:57,167 --> 00:08:59,840
"What Niles lacks in assertiveness,
he makes up for

172
00:09:00,007 --> 00:09:03,920
in an abnormally fussy
grooming regimen."

173
00:09:05,527 --> 00:09:08,405
"Frasier is exhibiting
clearly antisocial tendencies.

174
00:09:08,567 --> 00:09:10,922
In fact, he is extremely
uncomfortable with touch,

175
00:09:11,087 --> 00:09:13,043
seeming to recoil
from all human contact."

176

Where does it say that?

177
00:09:14,367 --> 00:09:17,279
All right, I added "extremely,"
but it's right there.

178
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:20,644
Good Lord.

179
00:09:20,807 --> 00:09:22,445
This cuts rather close to the bone.

180
00:09:22,607 --> 00:09:25,326
Just yesterday Roz was accusing me
of the same thing.

181
00:09:25,487 --> 00:09:28,957
I always thought it was just
an aversion to social hugging,

182
00:09:29,127 --> 00:09:31,197
but apparently
it goes deeper than that.

I should work on. What do you think?

It's her spa day.
She won't be home until...

301
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:04,519
Oh, I don't know. You know, maybe
they're just playing possum with us.

302
00:16:04,687 --> 00:16:06,723
Oh, frankly, I don't care.

303
00:16:07,087 --> 00:16:10,124
After what I've just done, you think I'm
gonna let a couple dogs frighten me?

304
00:16:10,287 --> 00:16:12,039
This is the last time
I'm leaving this house.

305
00:16:12,207 --> 00:16:14,562
I'm going to walk through that door
with my head held high.

306
00:16:14,767 --> 00:16:17,281
Good for you. I'm gonna run like hell
out the front door.

307
00:16:17,447 --> 00:16:19,642
Wait up.

308
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:25,276
Now, the beauty of the Hot 'n' Foamy
is the ultra-quick heating action.

309
00:16:25,687 --> 00:16:29,566
You just plug it in, and two minutes
later, presto. Guess what comes out.

310
00:16:29,727 --> 00:16:32,844
Well, the obvious answer
would be shaving cream,

311
00:16:33,007 --> 00:16:34,838
so I'll go with music.

312
00:16:35,047 --> 00:16:38,198
You had a lot of sassy things
to say about my clothes steamer too.

313
00:16:38,367 --> 00:16:41,006
But didn't those snow peas
taste delicious?

314
00:16:43,367 --> 00:16:44,641
DAPHNE: Hello.
NILES: Hey.

315
00:16:44,807 --> 00:16:48,436
- Where did you two slip off to?
- Oh, I just had some papers to sign.

316
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:50,199
- Thanks.
- Yes.

317
00:16:50,367 --> 00:16:52,927
Niles has decided
to begin divorce proceedings.

318
00:16:53,327 --> 00:16:56,956
- I'm sorry, Dr Crane.
- It's okay. I feel good about it.

319
00:16:57,167 --> 00:16:58,600
Now, we thought it might be nice

320
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:01,122
to have a family dinner
this evening at Chez Shea,

321
00:17:01,287 --> 00:17:03,357
so we stopped by to invite
the two of you to join us.

322
00:17:03,527 --> 00:17:05,961
Oh, that would be nice.
I'll just go freshen up.

323
00:17:06,127 --> 00:17:08,516
Yeah, sounds great.
And, Niles, I'm proud of you.

324
00:17:08,687 --> 00:17:10,917
I know this isn't easy,
but in the long run,

325
00:17:11,087 --> 00:17:12,600
I know you'll be happier.

326
00:17:12,767 --> 00:17:15,918
I'm damn sure I will be.

327
00:17:16,367 --> 00:17:19,120
Well, I can't believe it.
It's really over.

328
00:17:19,327 --> 00:17:21,682
And if you choose,
you never have to see Maris again.

329
00:17:21,887 --> 00:17:23,798
Oh, please. Half the time
I couldn't see her

330
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:26,527
when she was standing
right in front of me.

331
00:17:32,327 --> 00:17:34,204
Oh, my.

332
00:17:34,367 --> 00:17:37,200
- I can't breathe.
- Niles...

333
00:17:37,407 --> 00:17:38,601
No, really, I can't breathe.

334
00:17:38,767 --> 00:17:40,997
Frasier, I signed divorce papers.
What was I thinking?

335
00:17:41,207 --> 00:17:42,686
God, you're not having
second thoughts.

336
00:17:42,847 --> 00:17:45,077
I don't know. When I was
caught up in the adrenaline,

337
00:17:45,247 --> 00:17:47,442
it all seemed fine,
but now in the clear light of day...

338
00:17:47,647 --> 00:17:51,003
It's natural to feel a little shaky, but,
believe me, you made the right decision.

339
00:17:51,207 --> 00:17:52,720
- How do I know that?
- Let's just check

340
00:17:52,887 --> 00:17:55,196
what prompted us to it. Here.

341
00:17:55,367 --> 00:17:57,517
"Niles is incapable
of asserting himself,

342
00:17:57,727 --> 00:17:59,604
especially in front of females."

343
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:01,763
- Keep going. This is helping.
- "As I write this,

344
00:18:01,927 --> 00:18:06,842
he lies staring out the window,
licking himself."

345
00:18:12,407 --> 00:18:14,204
What?

346
00:18:14,527 --> 00:18:17,200
"He's become so subservient lately
that when he finishes

347
00:18:17,367 --> 00:18:20,837
grooming himself,
he often begins licking Frasier."

348
00:18:24,567 --> 00:18:27,400
I have no memory of that.

349
00:18:28,487 --> 00:18:31,923
"April 14th, the day
I've dreaded for weeks.

350
00:18:32,087 --> 00:18:34,043
Frasier died this morning.

351
00:18:36,167 --> 00:18:38,397
I never would've guessed
that my heart could ache so

352
00:18:38,567 --> 00:18:40,205
over the death of my beloved

353
00:18:40,367 --> 00:18:42,244
lab rat.

354
00:18:42,407 --> 00:18:46,241
My only consolation is the knowledge
that I will soon give birth

355
00:18:46,407 --> 00:18:48,841
to my first child."

356
00:18:49,927 --> 00:18:51,997
Frasier...

357
00:18:54,607 --> 00:18:56,199
...do you know what this means?

358
00:18:56,367 --> 00:18:59,359
Our mother named us after rodents.

359
00:19:01,367 --> 00:19:04,803
No, it means I have ended
my marriage to the woman I love

360
00:19:04,967 --> 00:19:08,755
based on the case history
of a spineless rat.

361
00:19:08,967 --> 00:19:09,956
- Oh, my God.
- Niles.

362
00:19:10,127 --> 00:19:12,561
Maris has seen the papers.
It's too late to take it back.

363
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,723
- Your reasoning was still sound.
- My reasoning?

364
00:19:14,927 --> 00:19:19,284
My reasoning was based on my
mother's obsession with vermin!

365
00:19:19,487 --> 00:19:21,876
- What the hell's going on?
- Niles is just a bit distraught.

366
00:19:22,047 --> 00:19:25,119
- Distraught? My life is over!
FRASIER: Niles, don't talk that way.

367
00:19:25,287 --> 00:19:26,879
My God, man,
you've got to calm down.

368
00:19:27,047 --> 00:19:28,162
All right, all right.

369
00:19:28,327 --> 00:19:30,045
I'm gonna splash
some cold water on my face.

370
00:19:30,207 --> 00:19:32,118
- Right. Right.
- Is he gonna be all right?

371
00:19:32,287 --> 00:19:35,040
- I've never seen him like this.
FRASIER: Of course he'll be all right.

372
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:37,880
Niles, just remember
to keep breathing.

373
00:19:38,087 --> 00:19:40,476
And, trust me, this is not the end!

374
00:19:40,687 --> 00:19:42,598
Your life is not over.

Dr Crane, are you all right?

00:20:08,127 --> 00:20:09,685
I'm fine.

381
00:20:10,847 --> 00:20:13,520
Just a little hot...

...and foamy.
