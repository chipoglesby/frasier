a number of things I don't care for.

Speaking of old chums, Daphne,
a Clive called for you a little earlier.

Clive? Did he sound British?

14

No, he was one of those
fiery Mexican Clives.

all the way to Rattlesnake Ridge?

No problem. They said
I can bring a guest.

Well, by my count,
two of us get to be lucky.

Jim. Of course, his name's
not really Jim.

25
00:01:27,207 --> 00:01:29,198
We call him that because he likes
to drink Jim Beam.

26

Just like we call Hank "Bud"
because he drinks Budweiser.

Oh, I am sorry.
I have dinner plans tonight.

- An ex-boyfriend?
DAPHNE: Worse.

Ex-fiancë.

- Oh, yes, that too.

48
00:02:36,727 --> 00:02:41,198
I just couldn't see a future with him.
I mean, the man was a total layabout.

49
00:02:41,407 --> 00:02:44,126
No ambition, no drive.
He couldn't hold a job.

50
00:02:44,327 --> 00:02:46,682
All he wanted to do
was tinker about with his car.

51
00:02:46,847 --> 00:02:48,997
His hands were always black
from the motor oil.

If God had intended me
to work on my Mercedes,

he wouldn't have given me Horst.

But I wanted to let him down easily,

It's not like I copied his name
off his mailbox

so I could look up his number
and call him while he's in the shower

- Your husband?
- Oh, yes.

00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:30,682
Six months next week.

Well, congratulations.

Yes, we're still

Oh, well, I suppose I could
stay for a beer.

Oh, good.

Dr Crane, I'm so sorry.

It seemed the kindest way
to let him down.

I didn't mean to put you
in such an awkward position.

as an undercover cop.

So now you've met

Although, Daphne, I noticed
in the phone book

you're still listed as Moon.

So, Clive, what do you do?

00:14:59,247 --> 00:15:01,238
Still mucking about with cars, I see.

292
00:15:01,407 --> 00:15:05,559
Oh, me hands? No, I helped a lady
change a tire on the way over here.

293
00:15:05,927 --> 00:15:07,883
Don't have as much time for cars
as I used to,

294
00:15:08,087 --> 00:15:09,361
what with my business and all.

- Your business?
- Yeah.

296

After you left, I remembered
the advice you used to give me,

297
00:15:14,327 --> 00:15:15,726
and I decided
some of it made sense.

298
00:15:15,927 --> 00:15:17,485
- What advice?
CLIVE: Well, you know...

299
00:15:17,687 --> 00:15:20,440
"Get a job, you lazy git,"
that sort of thing.

300
00:15:20,967 --> 00:15:22,320
So I took a few business courses

00:15:22,527 --> 00:15:24,165
and opened up
a little sporting-goods shop.

Next thing you know,
I had three of them.

Well, isn't this ironic.

All these years, I nagged him
to make something of himself.

And now look at him:

00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:45,522
Yes, well, send in the clowns.

308
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:48,803
Don't bother, they're here.

309
00:15:49,287 --> 00:15:50,402
Well, bad news.

310
00:15:50,567 --> 00:15:53,843
It seems my Maris has to run off.
She's got a previous engagement.

311
00:15:54,047 --> 00:15:55,878
Oh, forget about
your engagement, Maris.

312
00:15:56,047 --> 00:15:57,162
Stay for dinner.

313
00:15:57,367 --> 00:15:58,516
- Actually...
- I'd love to!

314
00:15:58,687 --> 00:16:01,884
Lovely. We can celebrate
you two being reconciled.

315
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:03,685
That is still tentative.

316
00:16:04,407 --> 00:16:06,045
It could go either way.

317
00:16:09,007 --> 00:16:12,204
CLIVE:
Hello there. What's his name?

318
00:16:16,287 --> 00:16:17,640
ALL:
Eddie!

319
00:16:20,607 --> 00:16:24,486
So there I was,
floating 20 feet up in the chamber,

320
00:16:24,647 --> 00:16:26,683
when some idiot turns off
the weightless button

321
00:16:26,847 --> 00:16:27,916
and down I come,

322
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:30,920
right on this big pickaxe
we used for moon rocks.

323
00:16:32,887 --> 00:16:34,445
And you still walk with a cane?

324
00:16:34,647 --> 00:16:36,000
<i>Que será será.</i>

325
00:16:36,807 --> 00:16:38,604
Well, I'd better turn in, boys.

326
00:16:38,807 --> 00:16:41,401
Don't forget your
warm glass of Tang.

327
00:16:44,167 --> 00:16:45,680
It was an honour meeting you,
commander.

328
00:16:45,847 --> 00:16:46,962
Yeah, I had fun too.

329
00:16:48,047 --> 00:16:50,083
- Well, good night, all.
NILES: Good night, Dad.

330
00:16:50,607 --> 00:16:52,120
Delicious meal, Daphne.

331
00:16:52,287 --> 00:16:54,243
Can't remember the last time
I ate so much.

332
00:16:54,727 --> 00:16:57,366
Well, that explains
your fantastic physique.

333
00:16:57,567 --> 00:17:00,286
Yes, you are looking
wonderfully firm.

334
00:17:01,207 --> 00:17:02,799
You used to have that little tummy.

335
00:17:02,967 --> 00:17:05,527
- Do you work out?
- Yeah, when I can.

336
00:17:05,687 --> 00:17:07,996
Actually, my shops keep me
pretty busy.

337
00:17:08,207 --> 00:17:10,118
Daphne and I have our own
little exercise regimen.

338
00:17:10,287 --> 00:17:13,245
We work up quite a sweat,
don't we, darling?

339
00:17:14,887 --> 00:17:16,286
DAPHNE:
I can't get over it.

340
00:17:16,487 --> 00:17:19,001
It's like you're
a whole different person.

341
00:17:19,367 --> 00:17:21,198
A whole different person.

342
00:17:21,367 --> 00:17:23,278
Well, who's for coffee?

343
00:17:23,487 --> 00:17:25,443
I'll give you a hand.

344
00:17:27,607 --> 00:17:29,723
Would you please tell Roz
to stop flirting?

345
00:17:29,887 --> 00:17:31,400
Has she forgotten
she's a married woman?

346
00:17:31,567 --> 00:17:32,682
Oh, you're one to talk.

347
00:17:32,887 --> 00:17:35,879
If you batted your eyelashes any
harder, you'd blow out the candles.

348
00:17:36,367 --> 00:17:39,086
You get rid of her now,
or it's Rattlesnake Ridge for you.

349
00:17:39,287 --> 00:17:41,198
- You wouldn't!
- Oh, wouldn't I?

350
00:17:41,367 --> 00:17:43,244
And by the way,
Stinky needs a ride.

And according to your love line...
Oh, my, what a naughty little...

353
00:17:51,447 --> 00:17:54,280
Maris, darling, I don't know about you,
but I'm exhausted.

354
00:17:54,487 --> 00:17:55,966
- You know...
- See you at home.

355
00:17:58,087 --> 00:17:59,440
More wine, please.

356
00:17:59,607 --> 00:18:01,962
Oh, are you sure that's wise, dear?

357
00:18:02,167 --> 00:18:04,601
Remember that blackout
you had last month?

[CHUCKLES]

359
00:18:06,327 --> 00:18:09,364
What am I saying?
Of course you don't.

360
00:18:12,127 --> 00:18:14,595
That's what I love about her,
her sense of humour.

361
00:18:14,767 --> 00:18:16,837
- Cookie, darling?
- Oh, no, thank you.

362
00:18:17,127 --> 00:18:18,924
Some of us do look after our weight.

363
00:18:19,407 --> 00:18:21,796
Now, now, Daphne,
you have to keep your strength up.

364
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:24,401
You are eating for two.

365
00:18:27,367 --> 00:18:28,846
You're having a baby?

366
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:31,601
Well, when were you planning
on springing that news?

367
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:33,604
We don't like to bring that up.

368
00:18:33,767 --> 00:18:36,122
It's a sore point around here,

369
00:18:36,287 --> 00:18:40,121
what with my sister-in-law
being barren and all.

370
00:18:42,487 --> 00:18:47,242
Now, now, it's not her fault.
You see, my brother is impotent.

371
00:18:52,967 --> 00:18:56,084
Well, congratulations.

372
00:18:56,247 --> 00:18:57,441
Is there a loo I could?

373
00:18:57,607 --> 00:18:59,757
Yes, yes, right there
by the front door.

374
00:18:59,927 --> 00:19:01,246
We call that Frasier's bathroom.

375
00:19:01,407 --> 00:19:04,604
That's why we've monogrammed
all the towels with his initials.

376
00:19:05,327 --> 00:19:06,840
Have you all taken leave
of your senses?

DAPHNE: She started it!
Hanging all over him.

378
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:11,845
What is your problem? Frasier said
the only reason we're doing this

379
00:19:12,007 --> 00:19:13,963
was because you wanted
to give him the brush-off.

380
00:19:14,167 --> 00:19:16,476
Well, I changed me mind.
Didn't you see my signals?

381
00:19:16,687 --> 00:19:20,123
Gee, I must have missed them. It must
have been during one of my blackouts!

NILES:
Wait, wait, wait.

There's no need to fight.
Look, I'll flip a coin.

- Oh, good news, Roz.
- Oh, sod off!

385
00:19:26,727 --> 00:19:28,718
You'd think, with all your dozens
and dozens of men,

386
00:19:28,887 --> 00:19:30,320
you could at least leave one for me.

387
00:19:30,487 --> 00:19:31,920
Dozens? Did you tell her that?

388
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:34,555
Well, forgive me for keeping track.

389
00:19:35,087 --> 00:19:36,679
Why are you fighting
over the man anyway?

390
00:19:36,847 --> 00:19:38,360
He's got all the charm
of a cricket bat.

You're right. You know what, Daphne,
you want him, you can have him.

- You can have him, he's yours!
- Oh, yes.

Fat chance I've got,
now that you've told him I'm pregnant.

How am I supposed to get rid
of this bloody baby?

No, thank you.

No! No, please.

You certainly aren't.

Look, I know I'm a guest here,
so I've kept silent so far,

401
00:20:09,527 --> 00:20:11,802
but I'm sorry, I must speak.

402
00:20:11,967 --> 00:20:14,401
You're the most appalling family
I've ever met.

403

You, breaking up with your wife
over a pair of opera glasses.

404

And you, looking down
your nose at me

00:20:22,207 --> 00:20:24,323
the entire time
you're showing off your posh flat.

Well, for your information, mate,

I don't think there's anything remotely
special about your bathrooms.

And you two women,

409
00:20:30,487 --> 00:20:33,081
flirting shamelessly with me
right in front of your husbands.

You, having just reconciled
with Frasier,

Well, I pity your child, Daphne.

And I pity
any good Manchester girl

that comes to this vile,
coffee-swilling Sodom

00:20:42,807 --> 00:20:44,559
and lets it change her
like it's changed you.

416
00:20:44,727 --> 00:20:46,638
But I haven't changed. Really.

We're not the awful people
you think we are.

No! The truth is we've been
lying to you all night.

Yes!

420
00:20:54,967 --> 00:20:58,277
Well, I don't care
to be lied to anymore.

Goodbye, Daphne, Maris,

I'll never understand
how two men like you

could've been spawned by
that sweet, courageous old astronaut.
