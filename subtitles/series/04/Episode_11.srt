- Mm.

You've never shown
any interest before.

They've never held one
in Aspen before.

Just think, hundreds of radio
psychiatrists, all in the same location.

One well-timed avalanche

profession could be restored.

Please, please, Niles.
Look, I'm begging you.

The station wants to replace me
with Helen Grogan,

21
00:00:59,247 --> 00:01:01,317
better known as Ma Nature.
She does a gardening show,

22
00:01:01,487 --> 00:01:04,877
and I'm just a little worried that a week
of discussing well-rotted manure

23
00:01:05,047 --> 00:01:07,003
will weaken my listener base.

- You wouldn't.
- I would.

30

- You can't.

I don't recall there being
any statute of limitations.

33
00:01:34,007 --> 00:01:36,919
I distinctly recall that when you asked
me to go out with Maris' sister,

34
00:01:37,087 --> 00:01:40,762
you said that you would
owe me one forever.

35
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:44,480
But you only spent one evening
with Brie.

36
00:01:45,207 --> 00:01:47,721
That hardly compares to what
you're asking me to endure.

Midway through the opera,
her ermine muff began to tremble.

39
00:01:57,167 --> 00:01:58,566
As it turned out, she had used it

40
00:01:58,727 --> 00:02:01,560
to smuggle in
her adorably incontinent chihuahua.

41
00:02:02,367 --> 00:02:04,676
Just as I thought we'd reached
the low point of the evening,

42
00:02:04,887 --> 00:02:09,005
I suddenly felt a sandpaper tongue
licking my earlobe.

Alas, it did not belong to little Hervë.

Fortunately, my shriek coincided
with the onstage murder of Gondalfo.

Roz will expect you on Monday at 2.

46

For your information, Brie had
a very tough row to hoe growing up.

47

It's not easy going through life
with only one nostril.

she had a cold that night?

I don't know what's wrong.

Perhaps you've forgotten my advice.
Let's review quickly.

- Yeah.
- The imaging exercises?

00:14:42,287 --> 00:14:44,642
Yeah, yeah, I did them.
What else did you tell me to do?

00:14:44,847 --> 00:14:47,122
Nothing. Bulldog called you,

does this guy wash his hair with?"
