FRASIER:
Oh, Roz, listen,

2
00:00:11,954 --> 00:00:14,422
I managed to get some reservations
to San Gennaro's tonight.

3
00:00:14,594 --> 00:00:16,346
Thought we'd go
celebrate your birthday.

4
00:00:16,514 --> 00:00:18,186
Oh, that is so sweet,

5
00:00:18,394 --> 00:00:21,192
but I have a date with that waiter
we met at lunch yesterday.

6
00:00:21,394 --> 00:00:24,306
- You're going out with that guy?
- I didn't have enough for a tip.

7
00:00:25,554 --> 00:00:27,385
Keep in mind the service
wasn't that good.

8
00:00:28,234 --> 00:00:30,509
The reservation won't go to waste.
I can always take Niles.

9
00:00:30,674 --> 00:00:32,107
Niles? Again?

10
00:00:32,314 --> 00:00:36,102
You know, your entire social life
consists of going out with your brother.

11
00:00:36,314 --> 00:00:38,270
Don't you think you're getting
into kind of a rut?

12
00:00:38,474 --> 00:00:39,748
You're still young.

13
00:00:39,954 --> 00:00:42,104
You need to go out and get drunk,

14
00:00:42,314 --> 00:00:44,953
wake up in a stranger's bed,
not even remember how you got there.

15
00:00:45,114 --> 00:00:47,582
In other words,
exchange my rut for yours.

16
00:00:48,114 --> 00:00:49,752
Well, do what you want,
but you know what,

17
00:00:49,914 --> 00:00:51,984
you could shake up your life
every once in a while.

18
00:00:52,154 --> 00:00:53,667
Do something spur of the moment.

19
00:00:53,834 --> 00:00:57,190
Once, I finished work on a Friday
and hopped a plane to Acapulco,

20
00:00:57,354 --> 00:00:59,584
and I didn't pack anything
but my toothbrush.

21
00:00:59,794 --> 00:01:01,864
I dimly recall you calling in sick
one Monday morning

22
00:01:02,034 --> 00:01:03,945
with a mariachi band
in the background.

23
00:01:04,594 --> 00:01:05,868
- Well, I was sick.
- Uh-huh.

24
00:01:11,194 --> 00:01:12,627
DAPHNE: Hey, Dr Crane.
- Daphne.

25
00:01:12,794 --> 00:01:15,831
I'm glad you're here. My zip's stuck.

26
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:19,188
NILES:
Well...

27
00:01:22,474 --> 00:01:24,988
...good thing I got here when I did.

28
00:01:25,634 --> 00:01:28,228
Don't be afraid to grab hold
and give it all you've got.

29
00:01:29,914 --> 00:01:31,552
Okay.

30
00:01:32,594 --> 00:01:35,711
Yeah, sometimes pulling it down
a bit helps.

31
00:01:35,874 --> 00:01:37,432
Okay.

32
00:01:42,714 --> 00:01:43,908
Oh, dear.

33
00:01:44,114 --> 00:01:46,912
I've zipped my tie into your dress.

34
00:01:48,034 --> 00:01:49,672
- It won't come loose.
- Oh, let me see.

35
00:01:49,834 --> 00:01:51,108
Well...

36
00:01:51,834 --> 00:01:52,949
I'm sorry.

37
00:01:53,114 --> 00:01:54,672
- It is stuck, isn't it?
- Yes, strange.

38
00:01:54,834 --> 00:01:59,225
Oh, maybe some liquid soap from
the powder room will help loosen it up.

39
00:02:10,114 --> 00:02:11,513
Niles...

40
00:02:11,674 --> 00:02:13,790
...there's something on your tie.

41
00:02:16,514 --> 00:02:19,074
Dr Crane was helping me
with my dress, and now he's caught.

42
00:02:19,274 --> 00:02:20,309
Yes, he is.

43
00:02:21,514 --> 00:02:22,947
- Here, allow me.
NILES: Be careful.

44
00:02:23,114 --> 00:02:24,752
FRASIER:
There. All right. Now.

45
00:02:25,314 --> 00:02:27,191
- There we go.
- Thank you. Oh, what a relief.

46
00:02:27,354 --> 00:02:29,231
I was just about to step
right out of this dress

47
00:02:29,394 --> 00:02:32,306
and embarrass poor
Dr Crane to death.

48
00:02:33,354 --> 00:02:36,266
Well, we all
have to die of something.

49
00:02:38,874 --> 00:02:41,866
Oh, Niles, I managed to score some
reservations tonight at San Gennaro.

50
00:02:42,034 --> 00:02:44,867
- You up for a little Italian?
- Actually, I'm going out with Maris.

51
00:02:45,034 --> 00:02:48,344
So I guess you could say I'm up
for a little Episcopalian.

52
00:02:48,554 --> 00:02:49,953
That's good.

53
00:02:50,114 --> 00:02:51,786
- Like some sherry?
- Yes, thank you.

54
00:02:51,954 --> 00:02:55,026
So, it seems your counselling sessions
must be going very well.

55
00:02:55,234 --> 00:02:57,145
They are. So tonight we thought
it would be a kick

56
00:02:57,314 --> 00:02:59,828
to recreate our very first date.

57
00:03:00,034 --> 00:03:01,103
That's sweet.

58
00:03:01,434 --> 00:03:02,549
NILES:
Hey, Dad.

59
00:03:02,754 --> 00:03:04,745
In fact, that day,
my car was in the shop,

60
00:03:04,914 --> 00:03:07,223
so I'm here to borrow Dad's car
just like I did back then.

61
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:09,067
Just saying that
makes me feel so young.

62
00:03:09,234 --> 00:03:11,623
"Gee, Dad, can I borrow the car?"

63
00:03:11,834 --> 00:03:15,110
You did that twice on the phone,
and I didn't find it cute then.

64
00:03:15,274 --> 00:03:16,992
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

65
00:03:19,234 --> 00:03:22,544
I just can't picture Maris
in Dad's '82 lmpala.

66
00:03:22,754 --> 00:03:26,030
Neither could she at first. I'll never
forget the look of wonder on her face

67
00:03:26,194 --> 00:03:28,754
- at touching vinyl for the first time.
- Ah.

68
00:03:28,954 --> 00:03:31,673
She said it made her feel
cheap and dirty.

69
00:03:31,834 --> 00:03:33,984
And she liked it.

70
00:03:35,114 --> 00:03:37,947
- I was her first bad boy.
FRASIER: Uh-huh.

71
00:03:39,234 --> 00:03:41,589
Yes, I remember the way you used
to carry her inhaler around

72
00:03:41,754 --> 00:03:44,393
rolled up in the sleeve of your T-shirt.

73
00:03:48,674 --> 00:03:51,393
Well, how about you two? You guys
wanna join me for dinner tonight?

74
00:03:51,554 --> 00:03:53,590
Oh, sorry.
Sherry's cooking me dinner tonight.

75
00:03:53,794 --> 00:03:54,988
And I have a date with Greg.

76
00:03:55,194 --> 00:03:58,106
- Greg? I don't believe I've met him yet.
- I have. He's gorgeous.

77
00:04:00,194 --> 00:04:01,422
Well, he is.

78
00:04:02,994 --> 00:04:05,269
Certainly the best-looking man
I've ever been out with.

79
00:04:05,474 --> 00:04:08,227
Of course, he doesn't have a thought
in that pretty little head of his.

80
00:04:08,394 --> 00:04:11,067
Oh, this could be the one.

81
00:04:12,274 --> 00:04:14,947
Well, you know, maybe I can have
Sherry cook for me some other time.

82
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:17,270
Oh, no need to put yourself out
on my account, Dad.

83
00:04:17,434 --> 00:04:20,267
Oh, Dad, did you happen
to check this message?

84
00:04:20,474 --> 00:04:22,510
No, I don't touch that thing.

- Laura's in town.
- Who's Laura?

90
00:04:34,874 --> 00:04:37,547
Stranger who called my machine
by mistake.

91
00:04:43,714 --> 00:04:47,104
Here it is, table for two,
Dr Frasier Crane.

92
00:04:47,274 --> 00:04:49,742
- From the radio, yes?
- Yes, yes.

93
00:04:49,954 --> 00:04:52,707
Oh, you know, actually my date
cancelled, so it'll just be me.

94
00:04:52,914 --> 00:04:54,427
I see, sir.

95
00:04:54,594 --> 00:04:56,471
Table for one.

96
00:04:58,434 --> 00:05:02,063
Well, there is no need
to lower your voice.

97
00:05:02,234 --> 00:05:03,713
I'm not ashamed to dine alone.

98
00:05:03,914 --> 00:05:05,393
Perhaps, as a man of some celebrity,

99
00:05:05,594 --> 00:05:08,791
I can serve as a symbol to others who
might otherwise be afraid to do so.

100
00:05:08,954 --> 00:05:11,946
I mean, really, in some cases it's
actually preferable to sit and dine alone

101
00:05:12,114 --> 00:05:14,674
rather than listen to someone too
much in love with his own voice

102
00:05:14,834 --> 00:05:16,586
prattle on endlessly.

103
00:05:17,834 --> 00:05:19,631
Well, you've convinced me, sir.

104
00:05:20,354 --> 00:05:22,709
I'll see if your table's ready.

105
00:05:24,674 --> 00:05:27,393
Dr Crane, your table for one
is ready.

106
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:35,873
Listen, is it possible for me...

107
00:05:36,034 --> 00:05:37,308
...to have a table elsewhere?

108
00:05:37,514 --> 00:05:39,425
I mean, I feel just a bit
conspicuous right here.

109
00:05:39,594 --> 00:05:42,347
I'm very sorry, sir,
but they're all reserved.

110
00:05:42,514 --> 00:05:45,631
But don't worry, most of our patrons
only have eyes for each other.

111
00:05:45,794 --> 00:05:47,227
Very well.

112
00:05:56,394 --> 00:05:59,227
- I'm so sorry, sir.
- It's perfectly all right.

113
00:05:59,394 --> 00:06:01,464
Just because I'm alone
doesn't mean I'm lonely.

114
00:06:01,634 --> 00:06:04,467
Perhaps I could have a glass
of your house cabernet.

115
00:06:04,634 --> 00:06:06,272
Very good, sir.

...complicated, Johnny.

to understand, but, you know,

really there's nothing wrong
with someone eating by himself.

126

You know, one time
I was really bad at school,

00:06:46,754 --> 00:06:49,314
and the teacher made me
eat lunch all by myself.

00:08:20,074 --> 00:08:23,032
To Amanda, my future bride.

155
00:08:23,194 --> 00:08:25,389
I will love you every day of my life.

156
00:08:25,554 --> 00:08:27,465
And I hope that when we die,

157
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:28,948
it's at the exact same moment

158
00:08:29,114 --> 00:08:32,584
so that neither one of us will ever have
to spend even one second alone again.

159
00:08:32,754 --> 00:08:34,346
Oh.

160
00:08:54,714 --> 00:08:56,193
Hi.

161
00:08:57,114 --> 00:08:59,423
Johnny said I could eat with you.

162
00:09:09,394 --> 00:09:11,305
Hey, Fras, how was your dinner?

163
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:14,353
Not since Quasimodo strolled
the streets of medieval Paris

164
00:09:14,514 --> 00:09:16,789
have so many people
uttered the phrase,

165
00:09:16,954 --> 00:09:18,990
"That poor man."

166
00:09:20,674 --> 00:09:22,710
I'm sure it wasn't as bad as all that.

167
00:09:22,914 --> 00:09:24,142
Oh.

168
00:09:25,594 --> 00:09:27,073
Oh, dear.

169
00:09:27,274 --> 00:09:28,992
The highlight of the evening came

170
00:09:29,154 --> 00:09:32,305
when the entire staff of waiters
delivered the birthday cake

171
00:09:32,474 --> 00:09:35,227
that I had ordered for Roz
and neglected to cancel.

172
00:09:39,794 --> 00:09:41,864
They sang to me.

173
00:09:42,514 --> 00:09:44,072
It's not your birthday.

174
00:09:44,274 --> 00:09:47,107
Staying right up with the story
as usual, Dad.

175
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:52,113
Anyway, after dinner
I took a long stroll.

176
00:09:52,514 --> 00:09:54,106
It suddenly struck me:

177
00:09:54,394 --> 00:09:56,305
I'm single.

178
00:09:56,874 --> 00:09:59,593
You know, I had gotten accustomed
to thinking of myself

179
00:09:59,754 --> 00:10:02,746
as recently divorced,
but that was five years ago.

180
00:10:03,434 --> 00:10:05,664
I'm 43, and I'm alone.

181
00:10:06,714 --> 00:10:07,942
Hey.

182
00:10:08,114 --> 00:10:09,786
I got something that'll cheer you up.

183
00:10:09,954 --> 00:10:12,514
I brought you some
of Sherry's mock apple pie.

184
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:18,593
It's called mock because they use
crackers instead of apples.

185
00:10:18,754 --> 00:10:19,982
[DOORBELL RINGS]

186
00:10:20,154 --> 00:10:23,305
Oh, good. Nothing spoils
an apple pie like apples.

187
00:10:26,114 --> 00:10:27,342
- Oh, Niles.
- Frasier.

188
00:10:27,514 --> 00:10:29,391
Oh, what happened?
Oh, no, let me guess.

189
00:10:29,594 --> 00:10:31,744
Robust color, fruity bouquet.

190
00:10:31,914 --> 00:10:33,870
I'd say that's an amusing little merlot.

191
00:10:34,314 --> 00:10:37,192
- Cabernet.
- Well, it's still amusing.

192
00:10:38,154 --> 00:10:40,793
So did you and Mrs Crane enjoy
recreating your first date?

193
00:10:40,954 --> 00:10:43,832
Oh, yes. My Maris remembered
details that I'd forgotten.

194
00:10:43,994 --> 00:10:46,269
For example, when I brought her home
after the restaurant,

195
00:10:46,434 --> 00:10:47,992
we took a stroll around the grounds.

196
00:10:48,154 --> 00:10:50,429
Suddenly, Marta appeared
on the balcony

197
00:10:50,594 --> 00:10:52,630
playing the part of Maris' late father.

198
00:10:52,954 --> 00:10:54,865
She was liquored up on Rob Roys,

199
00:10:55,074 --> 00:10:58,146
and firing Swedish meatballs at me
from an antique blunderbuss.

200
00:11:01,514 --> 00:11:05,905
Dad, am I the only one in this
household that checks this machine?

201
00:11:06,074 --> 00:11:07,746
LAURA:
<i>Hi, Molly. Laura again.</i>

202
00:11:07,914 --> 00:11:09,142
Again.

203
00:11:09,314 --> 00:11:11,987
<i>Is that Tom on the machine?</i>
<i>He sounds nice.</i>

204
00:11:12,154 --> 00:11:15,112
<i>Anyway, I just called to remind you</i>
<i>I'll have my cello with me.</i>

205
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:18,789
<i>Translation, you might wanna clean</i>
<i>out your car this time to make room.</i>

206
00:11:19,394 --> 00:11:21,146
<i>I know,</i> toujours la grande soeur.

207
00:11:21,314 --> 00:11:23,191
<i>Anyway, I can't wait to see you guys.</i>

208
00:11:23,354 --> 00:11:27,347
<i>I've been on my own way too much</i>
<i>lately. See you at 10:30, flight 11.</i>

209
00:11:27,514 --> 00:11:29,630
<i>Love you. Bye.</i>

210
00:11:30,794 --> 00:11:32,591
It's too bad there's no way
to call her back.

211
00:11:32,754 --> 00:11:34,631
She's gonna be stranded
at the airport.

212
00:11:34,834 --> 00:11:36,426
Oh, don't worry. She'll take a cab.

213
00:11:36,594 --> 00:11:39,427
You know, that happens a lot,
people leaving wrong messages.

214
00:11:39,594 --> 00:11:42,472
After hearing a stranger's voice
like that, it always starts me wondering

215
00:11:42,634 --> 00:11:43,669
what they must be like.

216
00:11:43,874 --> 00:11:45,990
You can't judge what a person's
like just from a voice.

217
00:11:46,154 --> 00:11:47,872
That's true. I was once told
that I sounded,

218
00:11:48,034 --> 00:11:51,106
imagine the impertinence, uptight.

219
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:59,189
And me, you'd picture
some cranky old geezer.

220
00:12:00,394 --> 00:12:03,386
I've lost track
of what point we're making.

221
00:12:04,074 --> 00:12:06,747
Well, she sounds to me like
a very interesting woman.

222
00:12:06,914 --> 00:12:08,586
- Intelligent.
- She speaks French.

223
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:11,183
Yeah. I always loved
the name Laura.

224
00:12:11,354 --> 00:12:13,948
MARTIN: You know, that was gonna
be your name if you were a girl.

225
00:12:14,114 --> 00:12:15,229
- Really?
MARTIN: Yeah.

226
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:18,744
Your mother always wanted Priscilla,
but I never like the nickname Prissy.

227
00:12:18,914 --> 00:12:21,269
I never much cared for it either.

228
00:12:27,834 --> 00:12:29,062
DAPHNE:
You know, Dr Crane,

229
00:12:29,274 --> 00:12:32,823
this Laura sounds like she might just
be a perfect match for you.

230
00:12:32,994 --> 00:12:34,712
If you left now,
you could meet that plane.

231
00:12:34,874 --> 00:12:36,068
FRASIER:
Honestly, Daphne.

232
00:12:36,274 --> 00:12:38,265
A couple of phone calls,
you're fixing us up.

233
00:12:38,474 --> 00:12:39,668
Well, think about it.

234
00:12:39,834 --> 00:12:41,984
She plays the cello. You'd like that.

235
00:12:42,154 --> 00:12:43,746
- She appreciates neatness.
- Yeah.

236
00:12:43,914 --> 00:12:47,190
She expresses affection easily.
That's good.

237
00:12:49,714 --> 00:12:52,786
Well, pardon me for
growing a little, okay?

238
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:58,184
She did mention being on her own
too much, so we know she's available.

239
00:12:59,514 --> 00:13:02,312
It's fun to speculate, but, come on,
you can't seriously be suggesting...

240
00:13:02,474 --> 00:13:03,873
DAPHNE:
Well, why not?

241
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:06,144
I can't imagine a more
exciting way to meet.

242
00:13:06,314 --> 00:13:08,270
The woman of your dreams
steps off a plane

243
00:13:08,434 --> 00:13:10,152
and there you are to rescue her.

244
00:13:10,354 --> 00:13:12,993
Oh, yeah, you can't beat meeting
somebody in a romantic way.

245
00:13:13,154 --> 00:13:14,985
That's the way it was
with me and your mom.

246
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:18,425
You met Mother over the chalk outline
of a murder victim.

247
00:13:18,594 --> 00:13:21,506
So? It was romantic to us.

248
00:13:21,994 --> 00:13:25,430
Every wonder why on our anniversary
she'd make those gingerbread cookies

249
00:13:25,594 --> 00:13:30,031
with the legs kind of bent
and the head kind of crooked?

250
00:13:32,354 --> 00:13:34,743
We thought they were dancing.

251
00:13:39,194 --> 00:13:40,912
I met a boy in a cute way once.

252
00:13:41,074 --> 00:13:43,429
I was 18 and visiting Stonehenge.

253
00:13:43,634 --> 00:13:45,465
This dashing young man
came up to me and told me

254
00:13:45,634 --> 00:13:48,148
he was an actual descendant
of the Druids.

255
00:13:48,354 --> 00:13:51,152
Boy, is that the one place
that line would work.

256
00:13:52,194 --> 00:13:53,946
I met someone once
flying home from college.

257
00:13:54,114 --> 00:13:56,389
I got bumped into first class,
found myself sitting next to

258
00:13:56,554 --> 00:13:57,953
a positively ravishing woman.

259
00:13:58,154 --> 00:14:00,304
She was older, and I was trying
desperately to be suave,

260
00:14:00,514 --> 00:14:03,586
so when she leaned over and
suggested we join the mile high club,

261
00:14:03,754 --> 00:14:06,712
rather than admit I was unfamiliar
with the term, I whispered back,

262
00:14:06,874 --> 00:14:09,149
"I really don't travel enough
to make that worthwhile."

263
00:14:14,594 --> 00:14:16,869
God, that was 20 years ago.

264
00:14:17,794 --> 00:14:19,750
No. Still can't laugh about it.

265
00:14:27,034 --> 00:14:28,706
LAURA: <i>Hi, Molly. Laura again.</i>

266
00:14:28,914 --> 00:14:32,065
<i>Is that Tom on the machine?</i>
<i>He sounds nice. Anyway...</i>

267
00:14:34,714 --> 00:14:38,912
She liked the sound of my voice.
She's called me twice today.

268
00:14:39,074 --> 00:14:41,713
That's already the best relationship
I've had this year.

269
00:14:44,754 --> 00:14:46,346
So are you going?

270
00:14:47,314 --> 00:14:48,588
Maybe.

271
00:14:48,754 --> 00:14:49,903
Oh, I don't know.

272
00:14:50,114 --> 00:14:53,470
There's nothing worse than when you
look back on a missed opportunity.

273
00:14:54,234 --> 00:14:56,304
- What the hell.
- Oh, this is so exciting.

274
00:14:56,474 --> 00:14:57,987
FRASIER: I can't believe
I'm doing this.

275
00:14:58,194 --> 00:15:00,150
- Before you go...
FRASIER: Stop right there.

276
00:15:00,314 --> 00:15:01,429
Don't say another word to me.

277
00:15:01,594 --> 00:15:03,664
I won't do anything this impulsive
if I over think it.

278
00:15:03,834 --> 00:15:06,906
Just let me get the hell out of here
before I change my mind.

279
00:15:10,114 --> 00:15:12,344
But not before I change my shirt.

280
00:15:29,714 --> 00:15:32,353
LAURA: Thanks for all your help.
I can take it from here.

281
00:15:34,474 --> 00:15:37,591
- Laura? Looking for Molly?
- Yes, I am.

282
00:15:38,114 --> 00:15:39,866
- Molly sent a driver?
- Oh, no, no.

283
00:15:40,074 --> 00:15:41,826
I'm not a driver. I'm a psychiatrist.

284
00:15:41,994 --> 00:15:44,064
I'm here to help you.

285
00:15:45,554 --> 00:15:48,068
- Molly's having me committed?
- No, no.

286
00:15:48,474 --> 00:15:50,271
I'm Dr Frasier Crane.

287
00:15:50,434 --> 00:15:52,311
- Oh, from the radio.
- Yes.

288
00:15:52,474 --> 00:15:54,829
- You know me?
- Yes, I've heard your show. It's great.

289
00:15:54,994 --> 00:15:57,303
But your knowing me is just weird.

290
00:15:57,514 --> 00:16:01,905
Actually, you left a couple of messages
on my machine today by mistake.

291
00:16:02,114 --> 00:16:04,674
Oh, no. I must've gotten
my sister's new number wrong.

292
00:16:04,834 --> 00:16:07,792
Well, I didn't want you waiting around
for someone who wasn't coming.

293
00:16:07,994 --> 00:16:09,985
So you came all the way down here?

294
00:16:10,154 --> 00:16:12,145
What are you, like,
the nicest guy in the world?

295
00:16:12,354 --> 00:16:14,026
Yes, yes, I am.

296
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:15,748
Well,

297
00:16:15,954 --> 00:16:18,912
speaking of nice, I would be delighted
to drive you to your sister's home.

298
00:16:19,114 --> 00:16:21,070
Oh, no, no, no, I'll take a cab.

299
00:16:21,274 --> 00:16:23,993
- Are you sure? It's no trouble at all.
- She lives an hour away.

300
00:16:24,154 --> 00:16:27,510
But, listen, could I buy you a drink
just to say thank you?

301
00:16:27,714 --> 00:16:29,067
Well, yes, I'd love that.

302
00:16:29,234 --> 00:16:30,462
May I take your cello?

303
00:16:30,674 --> 00:16:33,313
I checked my cello. This is my purse.

304
00:16:35,474 --> 00:16:38,466
I think that's funny.
Why doesn't anybody laugh at that?

305
00:16:39,114 --> 00:16:41,070
That is funny. Allow me.

306
00:16:42,514 --> 00:16:44,869
So are you with an orchestra?

307
00:16:45,034 --> 00:16:47,389
With a chamber music group, actually.

308
00:16:47,554 --> 00:16:49,988
We're based in L.A.,
but we travel quite a bit.

309
00:16:50,554 --> 00:16:53,546
I grew up here, so it's always nice
to come back. I miss it.

310
00:16:53,714 --> 00:16:55,670
So, what'll you have?

311
00:16:55,874 --> 00:16:58,263
I think I'll have a glass of sherry.

312
00:16:58,434 --> 00:16:59,423
Two.

313
00:16:59,594 --> 00:17:03,428
Not that you can expect that much
from airport-bar sherry.

314
00:17:03,594 --> 00:17:06,631
Oh, goodness, don't I sound like
the perfect snob?

315
00:17:06,834 --> 00:17:08,552
Yes.

316
00:17:08,914 --> 00:17:10,711
I mean...

317
00:17:10,914 --> 00:17:13,553
I agree with you about the sherry.

318
00:17:13,754 --> 00:17:15,346
So...

319
00:17:16,114 --> 00:17:17,593
...why did you choose the cello?

320
00:17:18,874 --> 00:17:20,512
When I was around 11,

321
00:17:20,674 --> 00:17:22,949
my father took me to the symphony.

322
00:17:23,114 --> 00:17:27,073
And this sounds a little silly, but when
I heard the cello, it sounded sad,

323
00:17:27,234 --> 00:17:28,792
like it needed me.

324
00:17:29,234 --> 00:17:31,623
That's not silly. That's lovely.

325
00:17:31,834 --> 00:17:32,983
I was always an odd kid.

326
00:17:33,154 --> 00:17:36,510
All my girlfriends had posters of
David Cassidy. I had Pablo Casals.

327
00:17:36,714 --> 00:17:38,193
I had Sigmund Freud.

328
00:17:38,394 --> 00:17:40,225
But did you kiss him
before you went to bed?

329
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:42,868
Well, I was tempted to...

330
00:17:43,954 --> 00:17:46,070
...but he just would've read
too much into it.

331
00:17:47,394 --> 00:17:48,622
Oh, here, thank you.

332
00:17:48,794 --> 00:17:51,467
I don't believe I've ever
shared a drink with a psychiatrist.

333
00:17:51,634 --> 00:17:54,148
I'm worried that you
must be analyzing me.

334
00:17:54,354 --> 00:17:57,983
Well, if I am,
my diagnosis so far is that I...

335
00:17:58,154 --> 00:18:00,031
I can't find a single thing
wrong with you.

336
00:18:05,514 --> 00:18:08,551
- Actually, it's quite good.
- Yes.

337
00:18:08,714 --> 00:18:11,433
My second pleasant surprise
this evening.

338
00:18:12,154 --> 00:18:13,382
Frasier,

339
00:18:13,554 --> 00:18:15,545
maybe I'm misreading you here,

340
00:18:15,714 --> 00:18:17,227
but I'm married.

341
00:18:18,194 --> 00:18:19,946
Oh.

342
00:18:22,194 --> 00:18:25,903
See, I don't know why I jumped to
the conclusion that you were single.

343
00:18:26,114 --> 00:18:29,151
Wasn't there something
in your message about having been

344
00:18:29,314 --> 00:18:31,032
on your own too much lately?

345
00:18:31,194 --> 00:18:34,630
- Oh, I've been away on tour.
- Oh.

346
00:18:35,554 --> 00:18:38,022
Well, I guess by now you've
probably figured out that

347
00:18:38,194 --> 00:18:41,709
my coming down here wasn't entirely
the act of a Good Samaritan.

348
00:18:43,394 --> 00:18:45,703
More like a lonely Samaritan.

349
00:18:46,154 --> 00:18:47,985
I guess that makes me
seem sort of desperate.

350
00:18:48,194 --> 00:18:51,231
No, I think it makes you
seem sort of romantic.

351
00:18:51,394 --> 00:18:54,147
I used to do things like this
when I was single. It was fun.

352
00:18:54,354 --> 00:18:56,424
Clearly you were better
at being single than I am.

353
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:59,028
Oh, come on.
Let me ask you a question.

354
00:18:59,194 --> 00:19:01,264
How did you feel coming down here?

355
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:02,987
I felt...

356
00:19:03,154 --> 00:19:04,382
...completely exhilarated.

357
00:19:04,554 --> 00:19:06,988
In fact, it's the most fun
I've had in recent memory.

358
00:19:07,154 --> 00:19:10,908
Exactly. The anticipation.
The excitement. The hope.

359
00:19:11,074 --> 00:19:13,747
Marriage is the death of all that.

360
00:19:15,314 --> 00:19:17,509
I hope you didn't write
your own vows.

361
00:19:18,914 --> 00:19:20,188
I'm not down on marriage.

362
00:19:20,354 --> 00:19:23,949
It's just marriage can be great,
but so can not being married.

363
00:19:24,114 --> 00:19:25,752
I suppose.

364
00:19:25,954 --> 00:19:27,307
Well, you're,

365
00:19:27,474 --> 00:19:31,911
you're smart, lovely, talented,
able to look at the bright side of things.

366
00:19:32,074 --> 00:19:34,542
I'm getting more disappointed
by the moment.

367
00:19:35,234 --> 00:19:37,270
I'm sorry it didn't turn out
the way you wanted.

368
00:19:37,474 --> 00:19:40,147
Oh, don't be.
Look, I really did have fun.

369
00:19:40,314 --> 00:19:43,590
You know, it's not very often
that I do something impulsive.

370
00:19:43,794 --> 00:19:44,988
Well, maybe you should.

371
00:19:47,754 --> 00:19:49,665
Well, I really should be going.

372
00:19:50,154 --> 00:19:51,872
Oh, no, here, allow me. Allow me.

373
00:19:52,034 --> 00:19:53,945
I'm the nicest guy
in the world, remember?

374
00:19:54,114 --> 00:19:55,752
I'll remember.

375
00:19:56,714 --> 00:19:58,352
Here we are.

376
00:19:59,674 --> 00:20:03,713
This is probably a ridiculous thing
to say, but if I weren't married...

377
00:20:03,914 --> 00:20:06,064
No, you don't have to finish that,

378
00:20:06,234 --> 00:20:08,190
but thank you very much
for starting it.

379
00:20:08,514 --> 00:20:09,788
Okay.

380
00:20:09,954 --> 00:20:11,182
Oh.

381
00:20:11,554 --> 00:20:12,748
Let me get that.

382
00:20:12,914 --> 00:20:14,029
Excuse us.

383
00:20:15,074 --> 00:20:17,144
If you ever think back on this,
could you just...?

384
00:20:17,354 --> 00:20:20,266
- I'll just edit that part out.
- Thank you.

385
00:20:28,194 --> 00:20:31,345
Excuse me, did you just hear
that gate-change announcement?

386
00:20:31,554 --> 00:20:33,385
No, no, I'm sorry.

387
00:20:33,554 --> 00:20:35,272
Perhaps they can help you
at the counter.

388
00:20:35,474 --> 00:20:37,465
Oh, good idea. Thank you.

389
00:20:37,674 --> 00:20:39,153
Where are you headed?

390
00:20:39,314 --> 00:20:40,793
- Mexico.
- Oh.

391
00:20:40,994 --> 00:20:42,188
How about you?

392
00:20:42,354 --> 00:20:45,426
Well, I'm just gonna finish up
my sherry and then I'm off to...

393
00:20:47,074 --> 00:20:48,746
I'm going to Mexico.

394
00:20:48,954 --> 00:20:50,626
Really? Acapulco?

395
00:20:50,994 --> 00:20:53,462
This is uncanny.

396
00:20:54,194 --> 00:20:55,707
Come on. What hotel are
you staying at?

397
00:20:55,874 --> 00:20:57,546
- Via Verde.
- That's where I'm staying!

398
00:20:57,714 --> 00:20:59,670
You're scaring me.

399
00:21:02,474 --> 00:21:04,510
THANKS FOR CALLING
