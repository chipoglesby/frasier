1
00:00:10,502 --> 00:00:16,133
Look at this. My so-called
windproof umbrella. Look! Look!

2
00:00:18,052 --> 00:00:22,848
l'd have fared just as well
with one of those paper ones.

3
00:00:23,015 --> 00:00:28,353
l collect those. They remind me
of great evenings l can't remember.

4
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:32,983
- City College wants you to lecture.
- Fine. Just tell me the date.

5
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:36,403
OK. St Bartholomew's Hospital
wants you at their benefit.

6
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,989
- Pass.
- Turning down a hospital?

7
00:00:39,156 --> 00:00:41,658
Yes.
Don't look at me that way.

8
00:00:42,868 --> 00:00:47,247
l'm with you. l hate how whiny,
sick people are always nagging.

9
00:00:47,414 --> 00:00:50,334
''l want a magazine. l want a kidney.''

10
00:00:52,753 --> 00:00:58,258
Roz, l sympathise as much as you do,
which is why l said yes last year.

11
00:00:58,425 --> 00:01:03,597
l bought an Armani tuxedo, wrote
a speech, put off a visit to Frederick.

12
00:01:03,763 --> 00:01:07,893
Then they didn't need me.
Their first choice had become available.

13
00:01:08,059 --> 00:01:10,937
The irrepressible Kathie Lee Gifford.

14
00:01:12,564 --> 00:01:16,318
- Way to hold a grudge!
- This is not about spite.

15
00:01:16,484 --> 00:01:21,114
This is about dignity,
a rare and fragile thing. Anything else?

16
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:25,201
- Judging the Miss Seattle Pageant?
- l'll do that.

17
00:01:27,329 --> 00:01:31,041
- That's dignified.
- A scholarship is involved.

18
00:01:31,207 --> 00:01:33,918
All right.
You're on in ten seconds.

19
00:01:34,085 --> 00:01:39,048
Look, we have new sponsors.
Work this copy in as often as you can.

20
00:01:42,385 --> 00:01:47,056
Good afternoon, Seattle.
This is Dr Frasier Crane. KACL 780.

21
00:01:47,223 --> 00:01:50,643
lt's a grey, depressing day
in the Emerald City.

22
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:54,022
Let's hope we can brighten up
your afternoon.

23
00:01:54,188 --> 00:01:57,984
We hold it our duty to banish
your rainy day blues.

24
00:01:58,151 --> 00:02:00,445
First, a message from a new sponsor.

25
00:02:01,362 --> 00:02:03,614
''Death is inevitable.

26
00:02:08,327 --> 00:02:12,623
''But it's especially painful
when it claims a beloved pet.

27
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:16,627
''lf you've lost,
or are planning to lose...

28
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,423
''...a cherished dog, cat or bird,

29
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:24,051
''let Pet Paradise console you
with a memorial

30
00:02:24,218 --> 00:02:27,889
''bearing the likeness
of your departed friend.

31
00:02:28,055 --> 00:02:33,060
''Pet Paradise. Though your pet
may be small, your loss is great.''

32
00:02:34,895 --> 00:02:37,940
- Who's our first caller, Roz?
- Edna.

33
00:02:38,107 --> 00:02:42,611
She's a receptionist
at a pest control firm. She's depressed.

34
00:02:42,778 --> 00:02:45,281
Hello, Edna. l'm listening.

35
00:02:45,448 --> 00:02:49,618
(Edna) 'Hello, Dr Crane. l've worked
in pest control for 1 5 years.

36
00:02:49,785 --> 00:02:55,040
'l go in every day, answer the same
calls, ask the same questions.

37
00:02:55,249 --> 00:02:59,211
'''What kind of bugs?
Have you seen any droppings?''

38
00:02:59,378 --> 00:03:03,591
'Then l go to the next person.
''What kind of bugs?'''

39
00:03:03,757 --> 00:03:07,094
Edna, l can sense where this is going.

40
00:03:07,261 --> 00:03:10,556
Even the most interesting life
can become routine.

41
00:03:10,723 --> 00:03:12,891
You need to shake up your world.

42
00:03:13,058 --> 00:03:16,520
Find a new boyfriend,
a new job, a new city.

43
00:03:16,687 --> 00:03:19,231
- 'You mean, move?'
- Well...

44
00:03:19,398 --> 00:03:25,028
There are easier places to cheer up
than this dreary, soggy city of ours.

45
00:03:25,195 --> 00:03:28,907
'Dr Crane, you're right.
l don't have to stay here.

46
00:03:29,074 --> 00:03:33,829
'When you think about it, there's
a whole world of vermin out there.'

47
00:03:33,996 --> 00:03:36,582
Eloquently put, Edna.
Thank you.

48
00:03:38,167 --> 00:03:43,338
Speaking of vermin...
''When that special rat of yours

49
00:03:43,505 --> 00:03:46,133
''turns its toes up for the last time,

50
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:49,469
''don't forget your friends
at Pet Paradise.

51
00:03:49,636 --> 00:03:53,640
''Pet Paradise.
When a shoe box isn't enough.''

52
00:04:07,446 --> 00:04:09,906
Another radiant morning.

53
00:04:10,824 --> 00:04:15,620
What do you think, Dad? Should l
drive to work or hail a gondola?

54
00:04:15,787 --> 00:04:20,125
l like rain. lt gets those
squeegee guys off the street.

55
00:04:25,338 --> 00:04:29,050
Now, stay put
until l can dry off your feet.

56
00:04:34,597 --> 00:04:36,766
There. That ought to do it.

57
00:04:36,975 --> 00:04:41,855
Daphne, get that hat off him. lsn't
it bad enough we had him neutered?

58
00:04:43,106 --> 00:04:46,860
At this rate,
l don't think l'm going to have children.

59
00:04:47,026 --> 00:04:49,821
Just let me dress up the dog.

60
00:04:49,988 --> 00:04:52,282
l've never seen him look that stupid.

61
00:04:52,448 --> 00:04:57,120
You'll change your tune when you see
his St Patrick's Day outfit.

62
00:04:58,121 --> 00:05:01,040
Hey, Derek Mann mentioned you
in his column.

63
00:05:01,207 --> 00:05:05,670
''l listen to Frasier Crane because
l'm trying to drop a few pounds.

64
00:05:05,837 --> 00:05:09,257
''His voice is an effective
appetite suppressant.''

65
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:13,511
- How witty.
- l thought so, too.

66
00:05:13,678 --> 00:05:16,305
Give me that.

67
00:05:16,472 --> 00:05:18,975
''Yesterday he advised
an unhappy woman

68
00:05:19,142 --> 00:05:23,521
''that she could cure her depression
by leaving Seattle.

69
00:05:23,688 --> 00:05:28,276
''lt would cure my depression
if the Seattle-hating Dr Crane

70
00:05:28,442 --> 00:05:31,612
''would take his own advice
and leave town.''

71
00:05:31,779 --> 00:05:35,533
- Ludicrous! l never said that.
- Yes, you did.

72
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:40,454
You said Seattle was dreary
and she should leave town.

73
00:05:40,621 --> 00:05:44,625
lt was one of several suggestions
taken out of context.

74
00:05:44,792 --> 00:05:47,169
- Apologise.
- What for?

75
00:05:47,336 --> 00:05:50,840
For insulting Seattle.
People take pride in it.

76
00:05:51,006 --> 00:05:55,136
They don't want you telling them
it's rainy and depressing.

77
00:05:55,302 --> 00:05:58,597
lf you hadn't noticed,
it gets a bit damp here.

78
00:05:58,764 --> 00:06:02,143
For God's sake,
the state flower is mildew.

79
00:06:04,895 --> 00:06:07,398
Listen, a city's like a woman.

80
00:06:07,648 --> 00:06:11,443
Get one mad at you
and it doesn't matter who's right.

81
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:14,905
You apologise
or you'll be paying forever.

82
00:06:15,072 --> 00:06:20,619
- l don't care for that analogy.
- l'm sorry. l was way out of line.

83
00:06:21,537 --> 00:06:23,831
All right, you're forgiven.

84
00:06:27,751 --> 00:06:31,004
Dad, to you,
everything is like a woman.

85
00:06:31,171 --> 00:06:36,176
A fast car, a romantic song...
A good meat loaf is like a woman.

86
00:06:37,886 --> 00:06:41,682
A city is not like a woman,
it's like a city. And l'm not apologising.

87
00:06:41,849 --> 00:06:44,935
lf you don't understand,
Seattle does.

88
00:06:45,102 --> 00:06:47,145
Seattle loves Frasier Crane.

89
00:06:47,312 --> 00:06:49,439
(Thunders)

90
00:07:02,244 --> 00:07:04,538
- Hello, Father Mike.
- Hello.

91
00:07:04,705 --> 00:07:07,207
Dr Crane was not bashing Seattle.

92
00:07:07,374 --> 00:07:11,128
He was sincerely trying
to help that woman.

93
00:07:11,294 --> 00:07:14,506
Who's our sponsor?
Pet Paradise.

94
00:07:14,673 --> 00:07:16,716
Go ahead and boycott them.

95
00:07:16,883 --> 00:07:21,304
See how easy it is to flush
your dead dog down the toilet.

96
00:07:22,305 --> 00:07:25,308
Was that a complaint
about the rain thing?

97
00:07:25,475 --> 00:07:27,894
l've been on the phone all morning.

98
00:07:28,061 --> 00:07:31,648
Forgive me.
l'll stick to subjects like suicide

99
00:07:31,815 --> 00:07:35,443
and stay away from controversial stuff
like weather.

100
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:38,613
- Hello?
- Hey, Doc, l need some advice.

101
00:07:38,822 --> 00:07:43,785
l feel a cold coming on. Should l
take vitamin C or leave Seattle?

102
00:07:49,999 --> 00:07:54,879
l hope you're happy. The switchboard
has had over 50 irate calls.

103
00:07:55,046 --> 00:07:57,924
50? Damn! You broke my record.

104
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:01,886
The most l got was 35
on my commentary,

105
00:08:02,053 --> 00:08:05,682
''Lady umpires: finally
a chest worth protecting.''

106
00:08:07,684 --> 00:08:13,356
- Frasier, think about apologising.
- l would if l'd said anything wrong.

107
00:08:13,523 --> 00:08:16,275
l've got half a dozen calls
that say you did.

108
00:08:16,442 --> 00:08:19,112
l don't want to talk to them.

109
00:08:19,278 --> 00:08:23,783
l don't know how to break this
to you, but it's a call-in show!

110
00:08:26,744 --> 00:08:29,664
(Woman) 'How can you say
Seattle is depressing?

111
00:08:29,831 --> 00:08:35,294
'l've spent 40 years here, working the
graveyard shift at a salmon cannery.

112
00:08:35,461 --> 00:08:38,214
'And, let me tell you,
you fatheaded moron,

113
00:08:38,381 --> 00:08:42,051
'l'm the most cheerful person
you'll ever meet.'

114
00:08:43,052 --> 00:08:46,180
Certainly the most cheerful
one l've met today.

115
00:08:47,723 --> 00:08:50,601
Alas, we're out of time.

116
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,397
l'd like to say,
as l've been saying for three hours,

117
00:08:54,563 --> 00:08:58,484
that it was not my intent
to cause offence.

118
00:08:58,651 --> 00:09:03,280
Since it seems obvious that l have,
l would like to apologise.

119
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,742
l do not find Seattle depressing.

120
00:09:06,909 --> 00:09:10,246
lt would take more than clouds
to obscure her beauty

121
00:09:10,412 --> 00:09:14,333
and more than drizzle to dampen
the warmth and fellowship

122
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:19,088
that make Seattle the only place
l care to call home.

123
00:09:19,255 --> 00:09:24,051
Till Monday, then,
this is Dr Frasier Crane, signing off.

124
00:09:25,594 --> 00:09:30,808
Good grief! Have you ever heard
such whiny, provincial crybabies?

125
00:09:30,974 --> 00:09:33,894
This city has lost
its rain-addled mind!

126
00:09:34,061 --> 00:09:36,939
Dr Crane, we're still on the air.

127
00:09:42,903 --> 00:09:45,072
Thank you, Roz.

128
00:09:47,324 --> 00:09:49,368
Now, we're off.

129
00:09:53,664 --> 00:09:57,626
(Niles) l believe this goes here
and that attaches there.

130
00:09:57,793 --> 00:10:00,712
Are you sure
you don't want me to try?

131
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:04,758
No, you might crack a nail
or snag a cuticle.

132
00:10:06,551 --> 00:10:10,389
- There. Are we getting anything?
- Does annoyed count?

133
00:10:12,557 --> 00:10:16,937
Hush. lf you hadn't bashed it with
your cane when the Seahawks lost,

134
00:10:17,104 --> 00:10:20,774
we wouldn't need a new set.
lsn't there a manual?

135
00:10:20,941 --> 00:10:25,570
Yes, but unfortunately, Stephen
Hawking isn't here to explain it.

136
00:10:32,702 --> 00:10:35,789
- l thought the winds had eased.
- They have.

137
00:10:35,956 --> 00:10:40,585
- What happened to your umbrella?
- A listener recognised me.

138
00:10:40,752 --> 00:10:42,921
He pulled it through a fence.

139
00:10:45,215 --> 00:10:49,511
You would not believe the hostility,
even at the Café Nervosa.

140
00:10:49,677 --> 00:10:55,016
l thought l heard a new cappuccino
maker, l saw three tables hissing!

141
00:10:55,183 --> 00:10:56,684
(Phone )

142
00:10:56,851 --> 00:11:00,480
- Don't answer it.
- l can't abide a ringing phone.

143
00:11:00,647 --> 00:11:04,651
lt's another crank.
They've been calling all day.

144
00:11:04,817 --> 00:11:06,861
Oh, no! They've got my number?

145
00:11:07,028 --> 00:11:10,782
So, the phone rings.
We don't have to answer it.

146
00:11:10,949 --> 00:11:16,287
Although it could be Frederick,
or Grammy Moon to say her hip's out.

147
00:11:16,454 --> 00:11:18,956
We can't be slaves to a bell.

148
00:11:19,123 --> 00:11:23,294
Just because it's going
ring...ring...ring!

149
00:11:23,461 --> 00:11:27,632
or, in the case of a British phone,
ring-ring...ring-ring

150
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:29,675
ring-ring...ring-ring!

151
00:11:29,842 --> 00:11:32,553
- Just answer it!
- Thank you!

152
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,764
Crane residence.

153
00:11:34,931 --> 00:11:38,184
He can't come to the phone.
May l take a message?

154
00:11:38,351 --> 00:11:42,813
Nice language, that!
l hope you don't eat with that mouth.

155
00:11:44,315 --> 00:11:49,320
Daphne, excuse me.
How dare you speak to a lady that way!

156
00:11:49,487 --> 00:11:51,781
Well, that's no excuse, ma'am.

157
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:57,995
Only cowards make threats by phone.
l dare you to say that to my face!

158
00:11:58,162 --> 00:12:00,206
Never mind where l live.

159
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:04,668
(Door rattles)

160
00:12:04,835 --> 00:12:07,129
ls anyone expecting visitors?

161
00:12:07,296 --> 00:12:10,174
l suggest we all remain very quiet.

162
00:12:13,135 --> 00:12:18,098
l have this image of angry villagers
wielding torches and pitchforks.

163
00:12:18,265 --> 00:12:22,478
- Frasier, open up! lt's Roz.
- lt's worse than l thought.

164
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:27,900
- Why are you out in this weather?
- l called, but your line is busy.

165
00:12:28,067 --> 00:12:31,153
- Hey, Roz.
- Hey, Martin. How are you?

166
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,697
- Good.
- New TV?

167
00:12:33,864 --> 00:12:35,908
Got it hooked up yet?

168
00:12:36,075 --> 00:12:39,370
No.
l let Niles take a crack at it first.

169
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,210
God! Martin, you're awful.

170
00:12:47,586 --> 00:12:50,714
Frasier, the station manager
came by.

171
00:12:50,881 --> 00:12:55,093
lf you can't smooth this over,
he may have to suspend you.

172
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:59,264
- What would he put in my time slot?
- The best of Crane.

173
00:12:59,431 --> 00:13:01,725
What will they do the second day?

174
00:13:05,312 --> 00:13:08,940
How can l smooth it over?
This city is out to lynch me.

175
00:13:09,107 --> 00:13:14,905
A guy cancelled on me cos l work for
you. You're alienating my boyfriends.

176
00:13:15,072 --> 00:13:20,077
We can't afford to lose
a demographic as large as that.

177
00:13:20,243 --> 00:13:22,746
We need damage control.

178
00:13:22,913 --> 00:13:27,292
lt's not too late to call St Bart's Hospital
and do their benefit.

179
00:13:27,459 --> 00:13:30,837
- After the way they treated me?
- There will be lots of media.

180
00:13:31,004 --> 00:13:33,089
lt's a chance to redeem yourself.

181
00:13:33,256 --> 00:13:35,300
- Listen to Roz.
- Dad!

182
00:13:35,467 --> 00:13:37,886
- Take my advice.
- l did. l apologised.

183
00:13:38,053 --> 00:13:40,597
Oh, so sincerely!

184
00:13:40,764 --> 00:13:44,934
You'll make a few jokes
and self-deprecating remarks,

185
00:13:45,101 --> 00:13:48,229
help sick people
and show you can laugh at yourself.

186
00:13:49,105 --> 00:13:53,735
- l think it's a brilliant suggestion.
- Niles, did you compliment me?

187
00:13:53,902 --> 00:13:56,613
lndeed l did. You're very sawy, Roz.

188
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:59,616
You remind me
of those amoral PR flacks

189
00:13:59,783 --> 00:14:03,453
who sell their services
to industries that pollute.

190
00:14:05,205 --> 00:14:09,042
- You think it's a good idea?
- lt worked for Nancy Reagan.

191
00:14:09,209 --> 00:14:12,795
She was widely criticised
for lavish spending,

192
00:14:12,962 --> 00:14:16,716
so she appeared at a dinner
in thrift store clothes

193
00:14:16,883 --> 00:14:19,260
and performed ''Second Hand Rose''.

194
00:14:19,427 --> 00:14:23,097
- That made people like her again?
- Yes, briefly.

195
00:14:23,264 --> 00:14:28,436
Tell them l'll MC. Better yet,
l'll take a table at the banquet.

196
00:14:28,603 --> 00:14:31,022
l have.
Give the nuns 800 bucks.

197
00:14:31,189 --> 00:14:34,025
- 800!
- Don't mess with them.

198
00:14:35,318 --> 00:14:39,614
l'm in a precarious position.
l must choose my material carefully.

199
00:14:39,781 --> 00:14:43,534
- l know some good jokes.
- No, Niles. You don't.

200
00:14:45,369 --> 00:14:47,872
lf you need jokes, use some of mine.

201
00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:50,875
Oh, yes.
l'm sure the nuns would love that.

202
00:14:51,042 --> 00:14:55,212
And l'll ask call Bulldog
and ask for a couple of limericks.

203
00:14:56,380 --> 00:15:01,302
l'll call Father Mike. l'm sure
he knows some inoffensive jokes.

204
00:15:02,011 --> 00:15:05,556
Hello.
Yes, well, l don't care how you feel.

205
00:15:05,723 --> 00:15:08,350
l want to use the phone right now.

206
00:15:08,517 --> 00:15:10,686
Your grandmother's hip is out.

207
00:15:10,853 --> 00:15:13,647
Just kidding!
Kidding!

208
00:15:29,705 --> 00:15:34,001
l do hope you'll have
some humorous stories for us,

209
00:15:34,209 --> 00:15:37,630
though, of course,
nothing too racy or risqué.

210
00:15:37,796 --> 00:15:40,174
- l wouldn't dream of it.
- Good.

211
00:15:41,091 --> 00:15:45,596
Last year, Kathie Lee Gifford
told a most unfortunate story

212
00:15:45,763 --> 00:15:49,058
involving newlyweds and a ski lift.

213
00:15:56,023 --> 00:16:01,445
Hello, all. Thank you for coming out
for such a good cause.

214
00:16:01,612 --> 00:16:05,699
St Bart's did my hip surgery.
They treated me good.

215
00:16:06,366 --> 00:16:09,119
l just saw Frasier. He seems nervous.

216
00:16:09,286 --> 00:16:11,997
There's a lot riding on this.

217
00:16:12,164 --> 00:16:17,002
Thank goodness he's got that
sweet old nun there to comfort him.

218
00:16:17,169 --> 00:16:21,006
She's not sweet.
lt's Sister Joselia, the scrubbing nun.

219
00:16:21,173 --> 00:16:25,135
- ''The Terror of Ward Three''.
- You still remember her?

220
00:16:25,302 --> 00:16:30,015
You know the nightmare
where l scream, ''Not the sponge!''?

221
00:16:30,182 --> 00:16:32,434
That's her!

222
00:16:32,601 --> 00:16:36,938
- As a girl, l considered being a nun.
- What changed your mind?

223
00:16:38,899 --> 00:16:41,401
l didn't want to work weekends.

224
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:46,448
- Where did Maris go?
- Mrs Crane is over there.

225
00:16:46,656 --> 00:16:51,119
She's cornered Lydia Beaumont,
head of the museum board.

226
00:16:51,286 --> 00:16:55,498
- Maris wants to get on the board.
- Lydia's getting away.

227
00:16:55,665 --> 00:17:00,420
The ''freshen-the-drink'' ploy. Lydia
has no idea with whom she's dealing.

228
00:17:00,587 --> 00:17:04,799
Chug that sherry, Maris.
On with the chase! Yes!

229
00:17:04,966 --> 00:17:08,970
She's gaining!
lt's Mrs Beaumont and Maris...

230
00:17:09,137 --> 00:17:11,264
And yes! They meet again.

231
00:17:12,891 --> 00:17:16,519
They'll be board-mates
before the dessert.

232
00:17:16,686 --> 00:17:21,357
- Evening, everyone.
- We were saying you look confident.

233
00:17:21,524 --> 00:17:24,652
- Really?
- Absolutely! Forehead.

234
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:30,783
- You memorise the jokes l gave you?
- Yes. That's why l look so confident.

235
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:33,244
Shouldn't they have started?

236
00:17:33,411 --> 00:17:36,622
We're waiting for the Bishop
who's introducing me.

237
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:39,208
He'll be here any minute. Break a leg.

238
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:44,547
Remember, keep smiling and look like
you're having a good time.

239
00:17:44,714 --> 00:17:47,758
- Right.
- lf a joke bombs, pay no attention.

240
00:17:47,925 --> 00:17:51,095
Do what Johnny Carson did,
make a joke about it.

241
00:17:52,555 --> 00:17:56,475
''Bomb-o!''
Boy, l miss that guy!

242
00:17:57,602 --> 00:18:00,521
Your dad's right.
Go up and be confident.

243
00:18:00,688 --> 00:18:03,357
l will, after l find a men's room.

244
00:18:03,524 --> 00:18:08,487
- lt's butterflies in your stomach.
- Not for long! l'll be back.

245
00:18:10,948 --> 00:18:13,743
Good evening.

246
00:18:13,909 --> 00:18:17,747
l'm Father Mike Mancuso
and l've just been asked

247
00:18:17,913 --> 00:18:20,249
to make a very sad announcement.

248
00:18:21,417 --> 00:18:25,504
Every year, our speaker has been
introduced by Bishop Cologie,

249
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:31,177
our chairman and host of the cable
TV show ''Pancakes and Parables''.

250
00:18:32,887 --> 00:18:36,890
We've just heard that the Bishop
has had a terrible accident.

251
00:18:37,891 --> 00:18:40,185
He was out fishing this afternoon

252
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:43,647
when his boat was hit
by a storm and capsized.

253
00:18:43,814 --> 00:18:48,569
At the moment, he remains missing.
l'll keep you informed.

254
00:18:48,736 --> 00:18:51,447
Why does everything happen
to Frasier?

255
00:18:51,613 --> 00:18:56,785
Devastated as we are, we know what
this evening means to the Bishop

256
00:18:56,952 --> 00:18:59,830
and how he'd delight in entertaining us

257
00:18:59,997 --> 00:19:02,332
with his biblical hand shadows.

258
00:19:05,586 --> 00:19:10,257
We also know he would be the first
to insist that we proceed without him.

259
00:19:10,424 --> 00:19:13,927
So, l'm going to step in
and introduce our speaker.

260
00:19:14,094 --> 00:19:17,681
Won't you extend
a cordial and gracious welcome

261
00:19:17,848 --> 00:19:20,600
to my friend and colleague,
Dr Frasier Crane.

262
00:19:22,477 --> 00:19:24,938
Dr Crane? Dr Crane?

263
00:19:25,105 --> 00:19:26,982
Ah!

264
00:19:34,197 --> 00:19:36,658
Thank you very much, Father Mike.

265
00:19:37,826 --> 00:19:39,870
lt's an honour to be here.

266
00:19:40,036 --> 00:19:44,958
l expected the Bishop to introduce me
but l'm sure he'll drift in soon.

267
00:19:52,007 --> 00:19:56,386
lt's a real comfort to see
so many priests out in the audience.

268
00:19:56,553 --> 00:19:58,680
l don't dare speak in public

269
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:03,268
without someone standing by
who can perform the last rites.

270
00:20:03,435 --> 00:20:06,813
Whoa! Very religious crowd, l see.

271
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:10,150
l can tell
because of the vow of silence.

272
00:20:12,235 --> 00:20:15,738
Got some holy water, Father?
l'm dying here.

273
00:20:17,991 --> 00:20:22,620
And speaking of water,
that reminds me of a little story.

274
00:20:22,787 --> 00:20:27,208
A rabbi, a minister and a priest

275
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:30,461
are all sitting at the bar
on the Titanic.

276
00:20:30,628 --> 00:20:32,880
Dr Crane! The Bishop!

277
00:20:33,047 --> 00:20:38,553
l heard the story with a priest,
but what the heck? A bishop's funnier!

278
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,514
Thank you, Sister. OK, then...

279
00:20:41,681 --> 00:20:45,643
A rabbi, a minister and a bishop...

280
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:50,773
...are at the bar when the purser
rushes in with the news...

281
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:53,901
Frasier, the Bishop is lost at sea!

282
00:20:54,068 --> 00:20:57,196
Are you telling this story or am l?

283
00:20:57,363 --> 00:21:01,075
- Frasier...
- l work alone, lady, all right?

284
00:21:01,242 --> 00:21:06,289
Anyway, the purser rushes in
with the horrible news about the boat.

285
00:21:06,455 --> 00:21:09,292
The rabbi says, ''My people need me.''

286
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:16,132
The minister is leaving when
the priest says... Sorry, the bishop...

287
00:21:16,298 --> 00:21:20,010
...says, ''Have another drink.
The rabbi can handle it.''

288
00:21:20,177 --> 00:21:24,849
The minister says, ''You abandon your
flock when we've hit an iceberg?''

289
00:21:25,015 --> 00:21:29,770
The bishop says, ''An iceberg?
l thought he said we hit a Weisberg!''

290
00:21:33,732 --> 00:21:35,985
Hello? ls this thing on?

291
00:21:37,945 --> 00:21:39,989
Bomb-o!

292
00:21:47,079 --> 00:21:52,126
# Baby, l hear the blues a-calling
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

293
00:21:52,292 --> 00:21:54,086
# Oh, my!

294
00:21:54,253 --> 00:22:01,009
# And maybe l seem a bit confused
Yeah, maybe...but l got you pegged!

295
00:22:01,176 --> 00:22:08,100
# But l don't know what to do with those
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

296
00:22:08,267 --> 00:22:10,394
# They're calling again

297
00:22:10,561 --> 00:22:13,647
# Scrambled egg's all over my face!

298
00:22:13,814 --> 00:22:15,858
