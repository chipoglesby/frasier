1
00:00:09,775 --> 00:00:11,902
We've time for one more, Roz.

2
00:00:12,069 --> 00:00:14,155
We have Sid on three.

3
00:00:14,321 --> 00:00:16,532
Hello, Sid. l'm listening.

4
00:00:16,699 --> 00:00:23,831
(Sid) 'Hello, Dr Crane. l fear talking
on the phone to people l do not know.

5
00:00:25,457 --> 00:00:27,501
'l freeze up.

6
00:00:28,836 --> 00:00:33,799
'lt is a severe handicap
in today's fast-paced world.'

7
00:00:35,676 --> 00:00:38,262
Are you reading what you're saying?

8
00:00:39,596 --> 00:00:41,640
(Paper rustles)

9
00:00:43,767 --> 00:00:45,436
'Yes, l am.

10
00:00:45,602 --> 00:00:51,984
'The only way l can communicate
is to write out everything in advance.'

11
00:00:53,193 --> 00:00:57,906
What if someone asks you
something you haven't anticipated?

12
00:01:00,075 --> 00:01:04,496
'Thank you for your
insightful comments. Goodbye.'

13
00:01:04,663 --> 00:01:06,790
Wait! Sid!

14
00:01:07,499 --> 00:01:12,004
Sid, your insecurity lies
in your fear of making a mistake.

15
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:17,426
You have to practise. lf you work
at it, you too may achieve...

16
00:01:17,592 --> 00:01:22,639
the command and confidence
to which we all aspire to...

17
00:01:22,806 --> 00:01:24,850
be having.

18
00:01:25,551 --> 00:01:29,972
This is Dr Frasier Crane
wishing you good mental health.

19
00:01:32,766 --> 00:01:37,020
- That was a show good.
- Thank you, Roz.

20
00:01:38,647 --> 00:01:41,567
- Knock, knock.
- What are you doing here?

21
00:01:41,733 --> 00:01:44,945
Want to go to lunch next week
at the Empire Club?

22
00:01:45,112 --> 00:01:48,824
- You know a member?
- No. But you may.

23
00:01:48,991 --> 00:01:51,368
What are you up to?

24
00:01:51,535 --> 00:01:57,874
You had that same look when you found
Flagstad's 1 932 ''Götterdämmerung''.

25
00:01:58,917 --> 00:02:05,674
lf all goes well, my lapel will be sagging
under the weight of a membership pin.

26
00:02:05,841 --> 00:02:12,138
You'll fit in with those blue bloods
who wouldn't even spit on the rest of us.

27
00:02:13,223 --> 00:02:16,101
Don't jinx it. l'm not in yet.

28
00:02:18,603 --> 00:02:23,566
There's still a party where
they screen prospective members.

29
00:02:23,733 --> 00:02:26,611
- How did this come about?
- l thank Maris.

30
00:02:26,778 --> 00:02:32,450
She spent years cultivating
relationships until fortune smiled on us.

31
00:02:32,617 --> 00:02:37,122
Old Judge Clements suffered a stroke
and a vacancy opened up.

32
00:02:38,706 --> 00:02:41,835
Gives new meaning to
''a stroke of luck''.

33
00:02:43,419 --> 00:02:47,006
lt gets better.
There are actually two vacancies.

34
00:02:47,173 --> 00:02:50,593
Edgar van Cortland
was indicted in a scandal.

35
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,263
Frasier, l think my time has come.

36
00:02:53,429 --> 00:02:56,641
- l'm very happy for you.
- That's generous of you.

37
00:02:56,808 --> 00:02:59,978
Especially as you've dreamed
of a membership.

38
00:03:00,144 --> 00:03:02,814
A lesser man would be jealous.

39
00:03:02,981 --> 00:03:04,941
- You're not?
- No.

40
00:03:05,108 --> 00:03:07,777
- They have a planetarium.
- So?

41
00:03:07,944 --> 00:03:10,238
l think my work here is done.

42
00:03:14,617 --> 00:03:18,037
- So he's getting into the Empire Club?
- lt appears so.

43
00:03:18,204 --> 00:03:23,251
He deserves to have lunch
in that private dining room,

44
00:03:23,417 --> 00:03:26,671
read in that fabled mahogany library.

45
00:03:26,838 --> 00:03:29,924
- lt's eating you?
- Like a bacteria.

46
00:03:31,342 --> 00:03:33,594
lf he gets in, l should too.

47
00:03:33,761 --> 00:03:38,391
What if l know someone
who could get you invited?

48
00:03:38,557 --> 00:03:43,229
- Don't toy with me.
- Mr Strickland, please. lt's Roz.

49
00:03:43,396 --> 00:03:46,315
- Walter Strickland Junior?
- Senior.

50
00:03:46,482 --> 00:03:51,028
- How do you know him?
- The less you know, the better.

51
00:03:57,636 --> 00:03:59,679
l need more comfortable shoes.

52
00:03:59,846 --> 00:04:01,890
My dogs are killing me.

53
00:04:02,057 --> 00:04:05,393
- Pardon?
- My ''dogs''. My feet.

54
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:10,940
- What do you call them in England?
- By their rightful names.

55
00:04:11,858 --> 00:04:16,446
Except Uncle Harold. He named
his anatomy after the royal family.

56
00:04:17,489 --> 00:04:21,868
He walked on the Queen's pins,
sat on the Duchess of Kent.

57
00:04:22,035 --> 00:04:23,536
A jolly fellow...

58
00:04:23,703 --> 00:04:29,375
until Aunt Kate caught him introducing
the Prince of Wales to a waitress.

59
00:04:31,336 --> 00:04:34,088
- Are you almost finished?
- Yes, l am.

60
00:04:33,955 --> 00:04:36,750
You'll have the handsomest midriff.

61
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:41,046
- l hope my date concurs.
- Who are you taking?

62
00:04:41,212 --> 00:04:46,843
Dr Susan Anderson. She's as boring
as toast but a brilliant physician

63
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:49,888
and socially well-connected.

64
00:04:50,055 --> 00:04:53,475
lsn't Niles a little ticked off?

65
00:04:53,641 --> 00:05:00,064
Yes, but l convinced him if we work
together we'll secure both vacancies.

66
00:05:00,231 --> 00:05:05,612
lt's like when you were kids. lf one
has something, the other has to, too.

67
00:05:05,778 --> 00:05:07,197
(Doorbell rings)

68
00:05:07,363 --> 00:05:11,117
l had to buy two Balinese lutes,
two découpage kits,

69
00:05:11,284 --> 00:05:13,620
two pairs of lederhosen.

70
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:19,042
When you moved out, that was
one embarrassing garage sale.

71
00:05:20,376 --> 00:05:22,420
- Hello, Niles.
- Ready?

72
00:05:22,587 --> 00:05:25,715
- No. Susan's at the hospital.
- Where's Maris?

73
00:05:25,882 --> 00:05:29,302
ln the Mercedes
practising her vivacious giggle.

74
00:05:30,178 --> 00:05:35,016
Let's go over our strategy.
l made a crib sheet on each member.

75
00:05:36,684 --> 00:05:41,564
''School ties, business affiliations,
hobbies, mistresses.''

76
00:05:42,815 --> 00:05:45,318
l also researched our competition.

77
00:05:45,484 --> 00:05:49,238
Don't worry. One of them flies coach.

78
00:05:51,616 --> 00:05:54,285
We're as good as in. Unless...

79
00:05:54,452 --> 00:05:56,662
l just had a terrifying thought.

80
00:05:56,829 --> 00:06:02,334
What if another candidate
researched the skeletons in our closet?

81
00:06:06,964 --> 00:06:09,508
Damn it!

82
00:06:10,426 --> 00:06:14,680
- That's as bad as it gets.
- l wouldn't be so sure.

83
00:06:14,847 --> 00:06:20,603
They wouldn't look kindly on your
arrest for mooning President Nixon.

84
00:06:20,769 --> 00:06:24,481
l was young and firm
and in love with an anarchist.

85
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:29,278
That's minor compared
to your suicide attempt.

86
00:06:29,445 --> 00:06:34,283
lt was not a legitimate attempt.
l did it to get Lilith's attention.

87
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:35,993
(Phone rings)

88
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,289
Maris and l should head over.
The others will get a leg up on us.

89
00:06:40,456 --> 00:06:44,251
- Good idea. See you there.
- Bye, Dad.

90
00:06:44,418 --> 00:06:50,132
Hello. Oh, Susan, l've been
expecting you. Are you in the car?

91
00:06:50,299 --> 00:06:54,887
No! You're still at the hospital?
Of course l understand.

92
00:06:55,053 --> 00:06:58,557
You were a sweetheart
to agree to go in the first place.

93
00:06:59,808 --> 00:07:02,269
l'll call you tomorrow.

94
00:07:02,436 --> 00:07:04,479
Fat chance.

95
00:07:07,608 --> 00:07:11,028
- Stood you up?
- This is disastrous.

96
00:07:11,194 --> 00:07:16,742
- Just go stag.
- l'd look like l couldn't find a date.

97
00:07:16,908 --> 00:07:22,289
Why are we worried? We got
a Cinderella right under this roof.

98
00:07:22,456 --> 00:07:27,085
That's the last time l get grout up
without wearing rubber gloves.

99
00:07:28,211 --> 00:07:33,633
l've so much gunk under my nails,
l look like l've been worming a pig.

100
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,095
Trust me, the English accent will sell it.

101
00:07:47,022 --> 00:07:52,694
Oh, yes. lt's everything
l ever imagined it would be and more.

102
00:07:53,945 --> 00:07:56,448
What's that smell, Dr Crane?

103
00:07:57,157 --> 00:07:59,868
That's power.

104
00:08:00,034 --> 00:08:02,078
Call me Frasier.

105
00:08:02,245 --> 00:08:06,499
People mustn't know you work for me.
We've dated for six months.

106
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:08,710
All right, Frasier.

107
00:08:09,627 --> 00:08:11,462
Anything else, Frasier?

108
00:08:11,629 --> 00:08:16,259
Are we in love or is this
just a physical thing, Frasier?

109
00:08:16,426 --> 00:08:18,469
Stop that.

110
00:08:20,763 --> 00:08:23,266
Oh, Niles. How goes the chase?

111
00:08:23,433 --> 00:08:26,185
Brilliantly.

112
00:08:26,352 --> 00:08:28,187
Daphne.

113
00:08:29,272 --> 00:08:32,650
- Evening.
- What are you doing here?

114
00:08:32,817 --> 00:08:36,779
Frasier takes me everywhere,
don't you, sweetheart?

115
00:08:37,613 --> 00:08:40,741
l'll go sample some hors d'oeuvres.

116
00:08:40,908 --> 00:08:43,578
Back in a minute, darling.

117
00:08:44,996 --> 00:08:47,665
- Darling?
- My date cancelled.

118
00:08:47,832 --> 00:08:51,878
Daphne's filling in.
You think l'd go out with Daphne?

119
00:08:52,044 --> 00:08:54,922
You are a man. She is a goddess,

120
00:08:55,089 --> 00:08:59,176
whose bedroom is only 41 steps
from your own.

121
00:08:59,343 --> 00:09:01,804
Where's Maris?

122
00:09:01,971 --> 00:09:05,224
Apologising to another candidate's wife.

123
00:09:05,391 --> 00:09:09,812
Maris bumped a dish of crabmeat
into the woman's décolletage.

124
00:09:11,439 --> 00:09:15,693
- Accidents will happen.
- As long as the hors d'oeuvres flow.

125
00:09:18,195 --> 00:09:20,823
My God. Feel this leather.

126
00:09:23,492 --> 00:09:26,412
l have had pudding stiffer than this.

127
00:09:26,579 --> 00:09:28,998
Frasier, Kenneth Spencer.

128
00:09:33,586 --> 00:09:38,799
l'm sure it was satisfying
being Phi Beta Kappa at Yale,

129
00:09:38,966 --> 00:09:44,013
but surely you would have been
happier at Princeton?

130
00:09:44,179 --> 00:09:46,557
Anyone who's anyone went there.

131
00:09:46,724 --> 00:09:50,477
Excuse me, l'm Kenneth Spencer.

132
00:09:50,644 --> 00:09:53,814
As it happens, l went to Princeton.

133
00:09:54,064 --> 00:09:55,774
No!

134
00:09:56,859 --> 00:09:59,027
What are the odds?

135
00:09:59,194 --> 00:10:04,408
l'm Dr Frasier Crane. My brother,
Dr Niles Crane, the eminent psychiatrist.

136
00:10:04,575 --> 00:10:09,705
He's too kind. He was eminent when
my eminence was merely imminent.

137
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:17,546
Try this caviar, Frasier.

138
00:10:17,713 --> 00:10:22,551
l met the most charming gentleman,
Edgar van Cortland.

139
00:10:22,718 --> 00:10:25,721
l thought he lost his membership
in a scandal.

140
00:10:25,887 --> 00:10:28,515
He was acquitted
and reinstated into the club.

141
00:10:28,682 --> 00:10:32,018
- Oh, he was innocent.
- No. Just acquitted.

142
00:10:36,022 --> 00:10:38,608
So there's only one membership?

143
00:10:38,775 --> 00:10:43,655
Yes. But if one is selected
you can bring the other as a guest.

144
00:10:45,615 --> 00:10:48,743
lf only one can become a member,
l hope it's you.

145
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:51,746
- That's noble.
- l know what it means to him.

146
00:10:51,913 --> 00:10:55,250
We can't risk another suicide attempt.

147
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:06,219
That's amusing, using humour
to defuse a tense situation.

148
00:11:06,386 --> 00:11:10,014
l'm sure that helped
when you were in prison.

149
00:11:12,892 --> 00:11:15,770
- Kenneth.
- Excuse me.

150
00:11:15,937 --> 00:11:17,981
(Arguing)

151
00:11:19,357 --> 00:11:24,570
Stop it! Do you intend to run each other
down and ruin both your chances?

152
00:11:27,824 --> 00:11:29,826
- You're right.
- Thank you.

153
00:11:29,993 --> 00:11:32,078
Cocktails?

154
00:11:32,245 --> 00:11:36,582
Yes. Your best 1 8-year-old
Lowland single-malt Scotch.

155
00:11:36,749 --> 00:11:41,587
- A discriminating choice.
- He has good knowledge of spirits

156
00:11:41,754 --> 00:11:46,092
from his years shacked up
with a barmaid.

157
00:11:53,432 --> 00:11:56,811
Mum says,
''Why can't l meet your boyfriends?''

158
00:11:56,978 --> 00:12:03,025
l say, ''The plane trip takes four hours -
longer than my relationships last.''

159
00:12:04,527 --> 00:12:08,698
There's Niles. Don't look at him.
Pretend we don't see him.

160
00:12:08,864 --> 00:12:10,658
Real mature.

161
00:12:10,825 --> 00:12:15,913
Thanks to him l can't say
the phrase l've rehearsed for a lifetime:

162
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:19,208
''lf you need me, l'll be at my club.''

163
00:12:20,292 --> 00:12:24,380
This is so boring.
You owe each other an apology.

164
00:12:24,547 --> 00:12:27,633
Yes, but l apologised first last time.

165
00:12:29,218 --> 00:12:33,347
That means it's his turn.
Goody! l can be mature about this.

166
00:12:42,731 --> 00:12:45,401
- Niles.
- Frasier.

167
00:12:45,567 --> 00:12:48,821
After last night, an apology is in order.

168
00:12:48,987 --> 00:12:51,573
l agree.

169
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,826
Well?

170
00:12:53,992 --> 00:12:57,579
- Well what?
- l apologised first last time.

171
00:12:57,746 --> 00:13:02,251
- No, you didn't.
- l did. After the Monet exhibit.

172
00:13:02,417 --> 00:13:06,046
My secretary left a heartfelt apology
with your service.

173
00:13:08,257 --> 00:13:11,760
So you did. lt is my turn again.

174
00:13:11,927 --> 00:13:13,887
Damn!

175
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:18,809
- l'm sorry.
- Me, too.

176
00:13:18,976 --> 00:13:21,061
l'm a terrible person.

177
00:13:21,228 --> 00:13:24,564
- We just turned on each other!
- lt was embarrassing.

178
00:13:24,731 --> 00:13:30,320
My only excuse is that all my life
l dreamed of belonging to a club.

179
00:13:30,487 --> 00:13:36,368
As a child, when l formed clubs
with my bears, some didn't make it.

180
00:13:39,996 --> 00:13:42,707
Hello. Yes, this is Dr Crane.

181
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:45,752
lt's the club.

182
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:47,462
Yes?

183
00:13:48,547 --> 00:13:52,467
l see. Thank you for considering me.

184
00:13:53,635 --> 00:13:57,138
lf you'd care to speak to my brother,
he's here.

185
00:13:57,305 --> 00:13:59,182
Be gracious.

186
00:14:03,812 --> 00:14:08,400
Yes, l see.
Thank you very much for calling.

187
00:14:08,566 --> 00:14:10,402
Goodbye.

188
00:14:11,694 --> 00:14:16,616
Don't let it get you down.
We were fine without them before.

189
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:25,750
We're fine without them, aren't we?

190
00:14:28,086 --> 00:14:31,422
Oh, my God. You got in.

191
00:14:35,093 --> 00:14:37,387
Congratulations.

192
00:14:38,513 --> 00:14:41,766
l'd better go break the news to Maris.

193
00:14:42,725 --> 00:14:49,107
Niles, your getting passed over
drains every drop of joy from this.

194
00:14:49,273 --> 00:14:52,276
Thank you. You're a good brother.

195
00:14:54,821 --> 00:14:58,282
Yes! l got in!

196
00:14:58,449 --> 00:15:01,285
Shout it from the rooftops!
Lattes for everyone!

197
00:15:01,452 --> 00:15:04,455
This is the proudest day of my life!

198
00:15:08,793 --> 00:15:13,089
Of course...
what really matters is family.

199
00:15:19,887 --> 00:15:21,806
Beg.

200
00:15:21,972 --> 00:15:24,600
Come on. We've worked on this.

201
00:15:24,767 --> 00:15:27,937
You can do it. Beg.

202
00:15:29,522 --> 00:15:31,816
Sit.

203
00:15:31,982 --> 00:15:34,235
Good boy!

204
00:15:34,401 --> 00:15:36,987
- What are you doing?
- Teaching him a trick.

205
00:15:37,154 --> 00:15:41,200
- With my imported prosciutto?
- lt's worth it.

206
00:15:41,367 --> 00:15:45,329
- Not unless he can sing from ''Tosca''.
- Where are you going?

207
00:15:45,496 --> 00:15:49,333
The Empire Club.
l've come to a moral decision.

208
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,544
l will insist
they give Niles my membership.

209
00:15:52,711 --> 00:15:54,963
That's a hell of a gesture.

210
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:58,217
l put myself in Niles' place.

211
00:15:58,384 --> 00:16:02,846
He's spent 1 5 years trying to climb
Seattle's social ladder.

212
00:16:03,013 --> 00:16:06,850
Then within two years,
l'm known throughout the city

213
00:16:07,017 --> 00:16:10,938
and l grab the prize
he's wanted most of all.

214
00:16:10,204 --> 00:16:12,290
lt just isn't fair.

215
00:16:12,457 --> 00:16:16,127
- You're a good kid.
- Thank you, Dad.

216
00:16:19,213 --> 00:16:21,299
l'll say this while l still can...

217
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:26,721
lf anyone needs me...

218
00:16:30,933 --> 00:16:33,478
...l'll be at my club.

219
00:16:34,729 --> 00:16:39,650
Yes, the club.
The club that l helped you get into.

220
00:16:39,817 --> 00:16:43,529
Now you're done with me,
l'm just cast aside.

221
00:16:44,363 --> 00:16:47,992
Unappreciated, unloved and forgotten.

222
00:16:49,035 --> 00:16:53,622
l see the prosciutto
isn't the only imported ham in the house.

223
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:58,627
Give me your shirt.
l need a full load.

224
00:16:59,962 --> 00:17:03,424
- Anything white?
- Yeah, but you're not getting them.

225
00:17:04,341 --> 00:17:06,385
(Doorbell)

226
00:17:09,388 --> 00:17:12,808
- Hello, Dr Crane.
- Hello, Daphne. Dad.

227
00:17:12,975 --> 00:17:14,810
Niles.

228
00:17:17,188 --> 00:17:21,108
Just passed Frasier.
Where was he off to?

229
00:17:21,275 --> 00:17:23,569
He went to the club.

230
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:28,073
No wonder he was evasive.

231
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:33,746
l hope you don't mind my stopping by.
l had no place else to go.

232
00:17:33,912 --> 00:17:38,250
Niles, you may get into that club yet.

233
00:17:40,294 --> 00:17:45,340
- What?
- He went to give his spot to you.

234
00:17:46,675 --> 00:17:49,136
ls this a sick joke?

235
00:17:49,303 --> 00:17:53,223
You should be happy.
He's giving up his own membership.

236
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:56,810
What would l be happy about?
This is humiliating.

237
00:17:56,977 --> 00:17:59,730
My brother going
to make them take me?

238
00:17:59,896 --> 00:18:02,774
His heart's in the right place.

239
00:18:02,941 --> 00:18:07,321
Dad, they made their decision.
l don't want their pity.

240
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:10,949
l don't care if they invite me now,
even if they BEG!

241
00:18:11,992 --> 00:18:14,619
Good boy!

242
00:18:24,045 --> 00:18:27,048
Excuse me, is the Club President here?

243
00:18:27,215 --> 00:18:29,843
Yes, Mr Drake is over there.

244
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:31,970
Thank you.

245
00:18:38,018 --> 00:18:39,853
Mr Drake?

246
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:45,483
- Dr Frasier Crane.
- Yes, of course.

247
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:48,486
The new blood. Please sit down.

248
00:18:48,653 --> 00:18:52,949
Sir, l've come here on
a matter of personal business.

249
00:18:53,908 --> 00:18:56,703
lt's about my brother Niles.

250
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:59,873
Niles is sort of...

251
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:05,879
My God. This leather's as soft
as a baby's bottom.

252
00:19:06,045 --> 00:19:10,466
On family night we bring babies in
and do a blindfold comparison test.

253
00:19:12,135 --> 00:19:14,429
That's a joke, Crane.

254
00:19:14,596 --> 00:19:18,099
Yes, indeed. Darn good one too, sir.

255
00:19:19,434 --> 00:19:26,107
My brother may seem priggish but he's
the most discriminating man l know.

256
00:19:26,274 --> 00:19:29,360
You'd be hard-pressed to find
a bigger snob in this room.

257
00:19:30,486 --> 00:19:34,115
Excuse me, sir, a glass of port?

258
00:19:35,658 --> 00:19:40,371
- 1 896?
- What are you saying, Crane?

259
00:19:40,538 --> 00:19:43,040
Glad to be aboard, sir.

260
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,838
No, l came down here to say

261
00:19:48,605 --> 00:19:52,901
that my brother deserves
membership more than l do

262
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:55,570
and l want to step down in his favour.

263
00:19:55,737 --> 00:19:58,948
- Are you serious?
- Yes, l am.

264
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:02,243
After all, blood is thicker than port.

265
00:20:04,579 --> 00:20:09,125
- l stand corrected.
- Let me be candid with you, Crane.

266
00:20:09,292 --> 00:20:15,631
We were quite firm about accepting
anybody in the entertainment business.

267
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:19,510
Radio psychiatrist
falls into that category.

268
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:22,555
Radio psychiatrist? But Niles...

269
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,810
- There's been a mistake.
- No, there hasn't.

270
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:33,274
Dad said you'd try
to get me in your club. Don't bother.

271
00:20:33,441 --> 00:20:36,777
l don't need you to fight my battles.

272
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:39,238
- But...
- Butt out.

273
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:46,078
You've made it clear how you feel,
so l'd like to share how l feel.

274
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:49,123
l'd sooner spend time
in a bus station

275
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:52,209
than spend one moment
with you smug bigwigs

276
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:56,088
with your oriental carpets
and overstuffed chairs...

277
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,757
My God, it's like a baby's bottom!

278
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:03,512
You can't reject me
because l reject you.

279
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,515
Yes, l'm talking to you, fuzzy.

280
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:10,853
l prefer being Niles Crane, everyman.

281
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,355
Friend of the average Joe.

282
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:18,819
Niles, they got our names mixed up.
l didn't get in. You did.

283
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:21,155
What?

284
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:26,285
lt was you they wanted.

285
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:30,539
l'm in? Good God, don't just
stand there. Fetch me some port.

286
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:33,292
Escort these gentlemen out.

287
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:36,170
You can't think l meant
the things l said.

288
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:39,464
Excuse me, sir,
l must ask you to leave.

289
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:43,677
You and who else?

290
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:50,017
Niles, we don't need this club.

291
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:52,936
Let us leave with dignity.

292
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:56,189
No. There's been a misunderstanding.

293
00:21:56,356 --> 00:22:00,277
l could just come part time.
Perhaps just one afternoon.

294
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:03,238
Thursday's a slow day.

295
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:07,367
l wouldn't talk to anyone.
l could just sit in a chair.

296
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:10,829
Please! Let me stay. l belong here!

297
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:21,172
# Hey baby, l hear the blues are calling
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

298
00:22:21,339 --> 00:22:22,424
# Mercy!

299
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:29,472
# And maybe l seem a bit confused
Well, maybe...but l got you pegged!

300
00:22:29,639 --> 00:22:35,270
# But l don't know what to do with those
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

301
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:37,731
# They're calling again #

302
00:22:37,897 --> 00:22:40,066
Frasier has left the building.
