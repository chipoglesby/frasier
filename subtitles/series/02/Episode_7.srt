1
00:00:10,252 --> 00:00:14,840
lf someone grabs your parking space,
don't just sit there, say something!

2
00:00:15,006 --> 00:00:20,428
A man with no front teeth and stitches
on his nose can't take criticism.

3
00:00:22,055 --> 00:00:27,435
- What's this?
- One of Daphne's inspirational tapes.

4
00:00:27,602 --> 00:00:29,604
Oh, my God!

5
00:00:29,771 --> 00:00:33,400
''Here, Have a Rainbow'',
by Dr Honey Snow.

6
00:00:33,566 --> 00:00:36,194
How can you listen to this drivel?

7
00:00:36,361 --> 00:00:39,406
lt's awfully popular drivel.

8
00:00:39,572 --> 00:00:43,952
She tells everyone they're wonderful
and nothing's their fault.

9
00:00:44,119 --> 00:00:46,871
What do you know? They like it.

10
00:00:47,038 --> 00:00:50,250
You should read one of her books.

11
00:00:50,416 --> 00:00:52,252
(Doorbell rings)

12
00:00:52,418 --> 00:00:57,924
l have. After a page, l yearned for the
worldly cynicism of Barney the Dinosaur.

13
00:00:59,342 --> 00:01:01,970
Niles, to what do we owe this pleasure?

14
00:01:02,136 --> 00:01:06,182
- Brace yourself. lt's raffle time!
- Not again!

15
00:01:06,349 --> 00:01:11,020
Yes. Ye gods, who's been plumbing
the shallows of Dr Honey Snow?

16
00:01:11,187 --> 00:01:14,607
- l have.
- lnsightful, isn't she?

17
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:21,197
Tickets are only ten dollars
and support Maris' little opera group.

18
00:01:21,364 --> 00:01:25,535
- What's the grand prize?
- Their lead soprano, Mrs Fitzgibbons,

19
00:01:25,701 --> 00:01:29,288
will come and perform
''The Ride of the Valkyries''.

20
00:01:30,748 --> 00:01:35,169
We've sold 800 tickets
so the risk is pretty minimal.

21
00:01:35,336 --> 00:01:36,796
All right.

22
00:01:36,963 --> 00:01:42,301
ln return, a stock tip: Vectorcomp
Software. Wendell says they can't miss.

23
00:01:42,468 --> 00:01:44,512
- Who's Wendell?
- My broker.

24
00:01:44,679 --> 00:01:48,849
Every stock he puts
me on to pays off. He's clairvoyant.

25
00:01:49,016 --> 00:01:54,188
l've got a bit tucked away. Maybe l
should take a chance with Wendell.

26
00:01:54,355 --> 00:01:58,234
- lt's not a sure thing.
- Nothing in life is a sure thing.

27
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:03,113
Dr Snow has a little saying:
''Nothing ventured, nothing gained.''

28
00:02:04,824 --> 00:02:09,411
She'd better copyright
that before some hack steals it.

29
00:02:10,454 --> 00:02:16,669
l'll go in for 500. That's a lot for me,
but l have a feeling l'm in for some luck.

30
00:02:16,835 --> 00:02:20,923
l'd better get ready.
l'm off to the Book Nook.

31
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:23,842
Dr Snow's signing copies of her book.

32
00:02:24,009 --> 00:02:26,470
What about my whirlpool therapy?

33
00:02:26,637 --> 00:02:29,681
Oh, right, l forgot.

34
00:02:29,848 --> 00:02:35,437
Would you go there for me, Dr Crane?
lt's around the corner from the station.

35
00:02:35,646 --> 00:02:38,899
l would sooner attend a hoedown.

36
00:02:40,859 --> 00:02:45,697
l have my compulsive spending
seminar and l hope to sell these tickets.

37
00:02:48,408 --> 00:02:51,286
- What's the big deal?
- My reputation!

38
00:02:51,453 --> 00:02:53,705
What's the big deal?

39
00:02:53,872 --> 00:02:57,501
OK. lf it makes you happy
to see me humiliate myself.

40
00:02:57,668 --> 00:02:59,711
l always get a kick out of it.

41
00:02:59,878 --> 00:03:01,880
Thanks ever so.

42
00:03:03,006 --> 00:03:08,345
Look, everyone.
Eddie has found his ''inner puppy''!

43
00:03:10,097 --> 00:03:11,473
(Eddie barks)

44
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:21,691
- This will just take a minute.
- l hope so. l've barely got an hour.

45
00:03:21,858 --> 00:03:26,154
Oh, God,
not another Honey Snow book.

46
00:03:26,321 --> 00:03:28,657
''Don't Change, You're Perfect.''

47
00:03:28,823 --> 00:03:31,159
People go for this junk?

48
00:03:31,326 --> 00:03:34,412
lt's unbelievable.
Get her autograph for me?

49
00:03:37,332 --> 00:03:42,921
Over there. Get it signed then
we'll have lunch at Le Cigare Volant.

50
00:03:43,088 --> 00:03:46,091
- Me? Why don't you do it?
- My reputation!

51
00:03:46,257 --> 00:03:49,177
What's the big deal?

52
00:03:49,969 --> 00:03:52,430
All right.

53
00:03:56,059 --> 00:03:58,102
lt's wonderful, isn't it?

54
00:03:58,269 --> 00:04:02,190
l just love what she says about
finding a moment each day

55
00:04:02,357 --> 00:04:06,235
to stop and give yourself a mental hug.

56
00:04:06,402 --> 00:04:09,322
l'm giving myself one now.

57
00:04:09,489 --> 00:04:11,199
Really?

58
00:04:11,366 --> 00:04:14,786
Actually, it's more of
a Heimlich manoeuvre.

59
00:04:17,497 --> 00:04:20,166
- Got it.
- Good. Let's buy it and go!

60
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:23,086
Not so fast. She wants to meet you.

61
00:04:23,252 --> 00:04:25,338
l don't want to meet the woman!

62
00:04:25,505 --> 00:04:27,548
Do you know what she looks like?

63
00:04:27,715 --> 00:04:31,886
l don't care. The woman stands
for everything l find totally...

64
00:04:34,555 --> 00:04:36,807
...enchanting.

65
00:04:36,974 --> 00:04:39,060
Hello, l'm Dr Honey Snow.

66
00:04:39,227 --> 00:04:44,106
And l'm... Wait, don't tell me...
Dr Frasier Crane!

67
00:04:44,273 --> 00:04:48,861
Dr Crane, let me shake your hand.
Oh, what am l saying - hug!

68
00:04:49,028 --> 00:04:51,697
Why not?

69
00:04:52,698 --> 00:04:56,702
After all, a handshake
is just a hug for fraidy-cats.

70
00:04:56,869 --> 00:04:59,080
No fear here.

71
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:06,837
- l am one of your biggest fans.
- l've recently become one of yours.

72
00:05:07,004 --> 00:05:12,176
l think the advice you give
is so brilliant, yet so simple.

73
00:05:12,343 --> 00:05:15,888
What about those
mental hugs of yours?

74
00:05:16,055 --> 00:05:18,891
lt can't get much simpler than that.

75
00:05:19,058 --> 00:05:21,810
l'll go get started on my appetiser.

76
00:05:21,977 --> 00:05:24,647
Yes, all l want is a little nibble.

77
00:05:24,813 --> 00:05:27,149
Tell me!

78
00:05:27,941 --> 00:05:31,028
l should go, but l'd love to talk more.

79
00:05:31,195 --> 00:05:34,948
There seems to be
such a positive energy between us.

80
00:05:35,115 --> 00:05:40,788
My publisher's giving me a dinner
tonight. Would you come as my guest?

81
00:05:40,954 --> 00:05:43,791
- l'd love to.
- That's great.

82
00:05:43,957 --> 00:05:47,461
- Nice meeting you, Dr Snow.
- Please, it's Honey.

83
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:53,258
lt certainly is.

84
00:06:00,182 --> 00:06:03,560
- Good evening, Dr Crane.
- Good evening, Daphne, Dad.

85
00:06:04,728 --> 00:06:09,441
- Oh, which horse did you wager on?
- Joe's Dream, number eight.

86
00:06:09,608 --> 00:06:14,321
Goodness. He's taking a serene,
almost Buddhist approach to the race.

87
00:06:18,992 --> 00:06:23,997
You should invest in something more
reliable, like Vectorcomp Software.

88
00:06:24,164 --> 00:06:26,374
- Our stock! Did it go up a bit?
- No.

89
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:30,837
lt went up a lot.
lt gained 40% overnight.

90
00:06:31,004 --> 00:06:37,052
<i>Wendell advised selling, so, voilà,
your original 500 plus 200 profit.</i>

91
00:06:37,218 --> 00:06:41,389
200? Dr Crane, l could kiss you!

92
00:06:45,352 --> 00:06:48,730
- That's a nice little dividend.
- l'll say.

93
00:06:50,982 --> 00:06:53,151
What shall l do with it?

94
00:06:53,318 --> 00:06:58,490
You could let Wendell reinvest it,
like l am. lt's called rolling it over.

95
00:06:58,656 --> 00:07:02,327
Then l'll do it. This is so exciting.

96
00:07:02,494 --> 00:07:04,245
What's all this?

97
00:07:04,412 --> 00:07:08,625
Your brother just gave me $200,
and now he's going to roll me over.

98
00:07:16,132 --> 00:07:18,801
- Niles?
- Communications breakdown.

99
00:07:18,968 --> 00:07:21,554
Good.

100
00:07:21,721 --> 00:07:25,183
- Why are you dressed up? Hot date?
- Yes.

101
00:07:25,349 --> 00:07:29,228
- With whom?
- Dr Honey Snow.

102
00:07:29,395 --> 00:07:32,523
Did it occur to you
l might not want Niles to know?

103
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:36,152
Sure it did. Right before l said it.

104
00:07:39,155 --> 00:07:43,284
You're dating Dr Honey Snow?
You consider her a ninny.

105
00:07:43,451 --> 00:07:47,580
What could you possibly see in this...
Ho ho, Mama!

106
00:07:49,582 --> 00:07:54,545
One hell of a cute shrink! No man
wouldn't let her analyse his dreams.

107
00:07:54,712 --> 00:07:58,382
Analyse them? She could star in them.

108
00:08:03,179 --> 00:08:06,849
But what do you say
when she wants to discuss her work?

109
00:08:07,016 --> 00:08:10,102
l just simply...skirt the issue.

110
00:08:10,269 --> 00:08:15,274
''Honey, your books are...
Oh, look, the waiter's on fire.''

111
00:08:15,441 --> 00:08:17,818
(Doorbell)

112
00:08:17,985 --> 00:08:21,322
You're jealous. But not half
as jealous as you're about to be.

113
00:08:21,488 --> 00:08:23,949
Get a coaster for your lower lip.

114
00:08:25,818 --> 00:08:28,529
- Hi, honey.
- Hi, Honey.

115
00:08:28,696 --> 00:08:32,616
Let me introduce you.
Daphne Moon, Honey Snow.

116
00:08:32,783 --> 00:08:35,870
Honey Snow, Daphne Moon.
She's a big fan.

117
00:08:36,037 --> 00:08:38,164
- Hug.
- Hug.

118
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:42,668
We both have sort of unusual names:
Daphne Moon, Honey Snow.

119
00:08:42,835 --> 00:08:47,381
lf you married my father,
your name would be Honey Moon!

120
00:08:51,677 --> 00:08:53,721
My father, Martin Crane.

121
00:08:53,888 --> 00:08:57,016
Hello. l see where Frasier
gets his good looks.

122
00:08:57,182 --> 00:08:59,602
Aw, get out of here!

123
00:09:01,103 --> 00:09:06,275
- Last but not least, my brother, Niles.
- Oh, Dr Niles Crane.

124
00:09:06,442 --> 00:09:09,862
l read a wonderful article you wrote:

125
00:09:10,029 --> 00:09:13,282
''Gestalt Therapy -
Probing the Subconscious''.

126
00:09:13,449 --> 00:09:19,621
Yes! And l believe l read your quiz in
Cosmo: ''ls your guy a stud or a dud?''

127
00:09:22,624 --> 00:09:27,504
- Perhaps we should go.
- Not yet. l want to give you this.

128
00:09:27,671 --> 00:09:30,465
lt's a manuscript of my next book.

129
00:09:30,632 --> 00:09:33,010
Another one? So soon?

130
00:09:34,136 --> 00:09:38,599
l hope you like it because
l'd love for you to write the foreword.

131
00:09:38,765 --> 00:09:41,685
- Me?
- Who better?

132
00:09:44,604 --> 00:09:48,275
Actually, there's so many other people

133
00:09:48,442 --> 00:09:51,611
more qualified to write
for such an important work.

134
00:09:51,778 --> 00:09:54,698
l almost think you don't want to do it.

135
00:09:54,865 --> 00:09:57,159
Oh, no, it's a great honour.

136
00:09:57,325 --> 00:10:01,580
l'll say. The last book had
an introduction by Mickey Rooney.

137
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:07,878
Then l'm writing that foreword!

138
00:10:08,044 --> 00:10:10,297
That's great!

139
00:10:10,463 --> 00:10:15,260
By next fall there'll be 500,000
copies with your name on the cover.

140
00:10:15,427 --> 00:10:17,721
l've got my Christmas shopping done.

141
00:10:23,852 --> 00:10:27,731
(Giggling)

142
00:10:29,274 --> 00:10:33,319
- Stop giggling. lt's distracting.
- Have you read this?

143
00:10:33,486 --> 00:10:37,740
l'm trying to recommend the book.
Reading it doesn't help.

144
00:10:39,534 --> 00:10:41,911
OK, here. How's this?

145
00:10:42,078 --> 00:10:45,415
''Volumes have been
written about human behaviour,

146
00:10:45,582 --> 00:10:48,751
''and l can say,
without fear of contradiction,

147
00:10:48,918 --> 00:10:53,756
''that this book can stand on the shelf
next to any of them.''

148
00:10:58,845 --> 00:11:01,222
- No good, is it?
- No, but this is.

149
00:11:01,389 --> 00:11:05,518
''You don't have to be a star to twinkle.''

150
00:11:07,645 --> 00:11:09,856
Frasier, l need a hug.

151
00:11:10,682 --> 00:11:13,518
Niles, will you please help me?

152
00:11:14,102 --> 00:11:18,189
Honey asked me to write this
and she's got a deadline.

153
00:11:18,356 --> 00:11:21,609
''Time is a concept known only to man.

154
00:11:21,776 --> 00:11:23,987
''Just for today, be a sunflower.''

155
00:11:24,153 --> 00:11:26,197
Give me that!

156
00:11:28,533 --> 00:11:30,952
You don't know what's at stake.

157
00:11:31,119 --> 00:11:35,456
l've never felt this way
about a woman. l'm out of control.

158
00:11:35,623 --> 00:11:42,088
Her effect on me is... There's no words
to describe it. lt's more like a sound.

159
00:11:42,255 --> 00:11:45,383
(Growls)

160
00:11:47,176 --> 00:11:49,470
Talking about Honey again?

161
00:11:49,637 --> 00:11:51,514
Yes.

162
00:11:51,681 --> 00:11:56,602
lt's laughable to put your name
on 500,000 copies of this piffle.

163
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:59,814
Not even piffle. lt's piffle-lite.

164
00:12:01,565 --> 00:12:03,943
Lay off your brother.

165
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:06,779
Some women make guys
do stupid things.

166
00:12:07,488 --> 00:12:12,743
When l was on traffic duty there was
a redhead who got away with anything.

167
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:16,956
She could be doing 90,
a school crossing guard on her hood,

168
00:12:17,123 --> 00:12:20,292
she'd flash that pouty smile

169
00:12:20,459 --> 00:12:25,297
and l'd ignore my partner, wag my
finger at her and send her on her way.

170
00:12:25,464 --> 00:12:30,094
Yes, it's the old
''good cop, horny cop'' routine.

171
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:36,850
Good, you're all here.
l want to show off my new coat.

172
00:12:37,017 --> 00:12:41,981
- Very nice.
- l've spent like a drunken yuppie.

173
00:12:43,691 --> 00:12:46,568
l went a bit over my budget.

174
00:12:46,735 --> 00:12:51,115
lf you're concerned about cash flow,
Wendell called today.

175
00:12:51,281 --> 00:12:53,492
Again? Four times in two weeks?

176
00:12:53,659 --> 00:12:57,204
The man's a wizard.
Daphne, your profit.

177
00:12:58,831 --> 00:13:00,874
$400!

178
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:04,127
Dr Crane!

179
00:13:04,294 --> 00:13:07,130
And here's one for Wendell.

180
00:13:07,297 --> 00:13:10,092
Did l mention
Wendell has a secretary?

181
00:13:11,385 --> 00:13:13,512
This calls for a celebration.

182
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:16,932
l'll take you all out for a nice dinner.

183
00:13:17,099 --> 00:13:19,685
l'll just put on my new dress.

184
00:13:19,851 --> 00:13:23,605
Put on your new shirt
and corduroy slacks.

185
00:13:23,772 --> 00:13:28,026
lf you're buying l'm gonna
wear elastic-waist pants and no belt.

186
00:13:31,571 --> 00:13:35,784
Well, Niles, that broker of yours,
he's a marvel.

187
00:13:35,951 --> 00:13:39,079
Yes, he's doing
wonderful things for me.

188
00:13:40,288 --> 00:13:42,541
l'd say so. l've been so impressed

189
00:13:42,707 --> 00:13:47,379
that l asked Daphne about it
and invested a few hundred.

190
00:13:47,546 --> 00:13:50,590
Really? Well, congratulations.

191
00:13:50,757 --> 00:13:54,886
Thank you but there's one thing
that's hard to figure out.

192
00:13:55,053 --> 00:13:59,557
Although l invested in
the very same stock that Daphne did,

193
00:13:59,724 --> 00:14:02,769
mine declined and hers went up.

194
00:14:04,688 --> 00:14:09,359
- How do you explain that?
- Obviously one of us is lying.

195
00:14:12,028 --> 00:14:14,072
What are you up to?

196
00:14:14,239 --> 00:14:18,076
This whole stock thing
was a lie from the start.

197
00:14:18,243 --> 00:14:23,706
No, first it paid off, but then it tanked.
What was l supposed to do?

198
00:14:23,873 --> 00:14:27,669
Tell that working-class Venus
l'd lost her life savings?

199
00:14:27,835 --> 00:14:31,422
l paid her back with a bit extra.
Where's the harm in that?

200
00:14:31,589 --> 00:14:37,136
Paying a woman for physical affection
is the oldest profession.

201
00:14:37,303 --> 00:14:40,223
Granted, it's the Walt Disney version.

202
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:44,018
But it's wrong. l insist you stop it.

203
00:14:44,185 --> 00:14:48,356
No, it's altruistic, noble and fun
and you can't make me stop.

204
00:14:49,482 --> 00:14:54,695
Dr Crane, take this $400 back
and buy whatever Wendell says.

205
00:14:54,862 --> 00:14:57,615
Consider it done.

206
00:14:57,782 --> 00:15:01,244
l should get on that gravy train myself.

207
00:15:03,955 --> 00:15:06,207
l'm in for 1 0,000.

208
00:15:06,074 --> 00:15:09,369
Good lord. $1 0,000, Dr Crane?

209
00:15:09,535 --> 00:15:14,248
Think of the dinner l'll be able to buy
when Niles brings me my profits.

210
00:15:14,415 --> 00:15:19,962
Hell, put me down for 200!
This guy's some kind of genie.

211
00:15:20,129 --> 00:15:22,173
He's a real treasure, isn't he?

212
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:27,804
l only hope those chest pains
he complained about are indigestion.

213
00:15:29,138 --> 00:15:33,601
Shall we go? l've decided on Farmer
Jack's Chicken, Chicken, Chicken.

214
00:15:33,768 --> 00:15:36,771
l hear the chicken there is very good.

215
00:15:36,938 --> 00:15:40,149
- Are you coming?
- You run along. l'll take my car.

216
00:15:42,777 --> 00:15:46,197
Well, l hope you're happy!

217
00:15:47,239 --> 00:15:49,825
Snap out of it! You're dishonest.

218
00:15:49,992 --> 00:15:52,411
- Said the pot to the kettle.
- What?

219
00:15:52,578 --> 00:15:55,331
- You know what it means.
- Don't be ridiculous.

220
00:15:55,498 --> 00:15:58,375
- Our situations are different.
- How so?

221
00:15:58,542 --> 00:16:02,588
- You're selfishly misleading a woman.
- So are you!

222
00:16:02,755 --> 00:16:06,133
- She also...trusts you.
- And the difference is?

223
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,969
Your woman is English.

224
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:15,517
- Frasier, you've lost this one.
- l know.

225
00:16:15,684 --> 00:16:18,062
lt'll just take a little while...

226
00:16:18,228 --> 00:16:21,774
to climb down
off this particular high horse.

227
00:16:27,321 --> 00:16:30,949
- l think you know what you have to do.
- Yes.

228
00:16:33,243 --> 00:16:37,080
l have to tell her
l can't write the foreword.

229
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:41,251
And l have to say goodbye

230
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:45,255
to the chance of ever
sleeping with absolute perfection.

231
00:16:47,925 --> 00:16:50,177
Where, oh where...

232
00:16:50,344 --> 00:16:52,721
will l have the chance again...

233
00:16:53,722 --> 00:16:58,060
to gaze upon such
extraordinarily proud...

234
00:16:58,226 --> 00:17:00,604
and supple breasts?

235
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:03,774
Not to worry, brother.

236
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:07,986
That's the special at Farmer Jack's
Chicken, Chicken, Chicken.

237
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:21,082
- Thanks for the wonderful dinner.
- Thank you for the fabulous table.

238
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:24,294
Hugging the maître d' really clinched it.

239
00:17:24,461 --> 00:17:28,173
- Would you care for a nightcap?
- Sure.

240
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:32,552
You seemed tense all evening,
but l have just the thing.

241
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:35,555
lt's a sandalwood candle.

242
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:39,726
The scent is guaranteed
to calm you down.

243
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:45,523
You better fire up about ten of those.

244
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:58,703
l'd really like to talk to you about that
foreword l've been trying to write.

245
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:00,914
Can we not talk about work?

246
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:07,045
All day l've been researching an article
on sexual intimacy.

247
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:11,799
l'm up to here with ''The Joy of Sex''
''Kamasutra'', Masters and Johnson...

248
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:14,010
Really?

249
00:18:14,177 --> 00:18:18,514
l feel like l've been
reading recipes all day,

250
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:22,393
only there are no groceries
in the house.

251
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:26,272
Well, your bagboy has arrived.

252
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:35,907
l really need to discuss this now.

253
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:39,035
You're such a workaholic.

254
00:18:39,202 --> 00:18:42,705
l only hope you're this tireless
about everything.

255
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:47,627
Oh, you won't have any complaints.

256
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:52,048
l've got to focus
on the subject at hand.

257
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:55,634
Frasier, tonight,
l am the subject at hand.

258
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:04,894
No, no, Honey, l can't do it!

259
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:08,772
That's all right.
l have a candle for that, too.

260
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:12,568
No, l can't write the foreword.

261
00:19:12,735 --> 00:19:14,904
Why not?

262
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:20,034
Well, l...
l didn't think it was a very good book.

263
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:24,288
l think the world of you
and wish you success

264
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:29,126
but the book isn't good enough
to put my name on it.

265
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:32,629
l guess l'll be going now.

266
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:37,342
l am so attracted to you right now.

267
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:44,892
Most men will say anything
to a woman to have sex.

268
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:49,897
How great to meet a man who would
risk rejection rather than be dishonest.

269
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:52,274
Well, l...

270
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:58,405
have to be true to my inner voice.

271
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:06,204
l thought the book was weak myself.
l rushed it to meet a deadline.

272
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:11,793
l'm so glad you respected me
enough to be honest.

273
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:16,381
l think honesty is
the greatest aphrodisiac of all.

274
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:19,301
l hope you feel you can be
as honest with me.

275
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:24,598
l do. Tell me everything.
l don't want us to hide anything.

276
00:20:24,764 --> 00:20:30,270
<i>Your chapter titles were
clumsy and jejune. Your turn.</i>

277
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:33,815
You use too much French
in everyday conversation.

278
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:37,027
l think that sandalwood stinks.

279
00:20:41,364 --> 00:20:45,201
When you talk about wine,
l wish l had a gun.

280
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:50,623
l thought your first three books
were trite and saccharine.

281
00:20:51,624 --> 00:20:54,043
lt's your turn, Honey.

282
00:20:56,921 --> 00:20:59,257
Honey?

283
00:21:02,218 --> 00:21:05,763
l'm immensely proud
of my first three books.

284
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:08,141
As well you should be.

285
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:13,271
- You thought they were trite.
- l meant trite in its best sense.

286
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:16,274
As in the phrase, ''trite and true''.

287
00:21:20,903 --> 00:21:25,783
- What about saccharine?
- l love it. Use it every day.

288
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:29,120
l'm glad you like saccharine, darling.

289
00:21:29,287 --> 00:21:33,124
Because there's no way
you're getting any Honey.

290
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:39,964
Good night, Frasier.

291
00:21:43,342 --> 00:21:45,386
Honey, l...

292
00:21:46,137 --> 00:21:48,681
l'm sorry. l really am.

293
00:21:49,724 --> 00:21:53,728
Couldn't we try one of
your forgiveness exercises?

294
00:21:54,562 --> 00:21:58,065
- Good night, Frasier.
- Hug?

295
00:21:59,317 --> 00:22:03,487
A poet once said something about
the world that applies to us:

296
00:22:03,654 --> 00:22:08,075
''lt ends not with a bang,
but with a whimper.''

297
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:20,880
# Hey baby, l hear the blues are calling
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

298
00:22:21,046 --> 00:22:22,423
# Quite stylish!

299
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:29,471
# And maybe l seem a bit confused
Well, maybe, but l got you pegged

300
00:22:29,638 --> 00:22:35,436
# But l don't know what to do with those
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

301
00:22:35,602 --> 00:22:38,105
# They're calling again #

302
00:22:38,272 --> 00:22:41,066
Good night!
