1
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:24,357
Dad!

2
00:00:26,068 --> 00:00:28,111
Daphne!

3
00:00:29,988 --> 00:00:32,199
Anybody home?

4
00:00:39,497 --> 00:00:45,211
(Plays a serene classical melody)

5
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:50,675
(lmprovises a clichéd intro )

6
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:56,222
(Repeats his intro )

7
00:01:13,389 --> 00:01:18,311
(Hurriedly reverts
to playing classical music )

8
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:22,932
- You're making a big deal of this.
- Dad, l've never seen Maris this angry.

9
00:01:23,099 --> 00:01:27,103
Her eye was twitching
like a frog in a science experiment.

10
00:01:28,813 --> 00:01:35,069
When your mother got mad, l'd bend
her backwards and give her a kiss.

11
00:01:35,236 --> 00:01:40,616
l can't do that with Maris.
She has rigid vertebrae. She'd snap.

12
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:45,038
Maris moved into the east wing again?

13
00:01:45,204 --> 00:01:50,460
Sunday was her 40th birthday. She
said she wanted no acknowledgement.

14
00:01:50,626 --> 00:01:54,964
ln a moment l live over and over
in my dreams, l believed her!

15
00:01:56,007 --> 00:01:58,676
No gifts, no party, no nothing?

16
00:01:58,843 --> 00:02:03,764
Say that weeping into a lap robe
and you've got her down perfectly.

17
00:02:03,931 --> 00:02:06,392
- Get her perfume.
- She gets hives.

18
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:09,353
- Candy?
- Hypoglycaemic.

19
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,149
- A dozen roses?
- Allergic.

20
00:02:13,316 --> 00:02:16,902
Just sit her down
and tell her it was a mistake.

21
00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:21,574
She's touchy about her age.
lt's not the first time she's turned 40.

22
00:02:26,203 --> 00:02:29,415
l know. l'll throw a big party
this weekend.

23
00:02:29,582 --> 00:02:33,169
A costume ball
with a Louis XlV theme,

24
00:02:33,335 --> 00:02:36,922
right down to the wigs
and velvet pantaloons.

25
00:02:37,089 --> 00:02:39,133
l presume you both have colds?

26
00:02:41,635 --> 00:02:43,846
And so it goes.

27
00:02:45,139 --> 00:02:51,145
Did you find a book lying around?
The station manager loaned it to me.

28
00:02:51,312 --> 00:02:56,984
''The Life of Sir Herbert Beerbohm
Tree''. A history of English theatre.

29
00:02:57,151 --> 00:03:01,697
You caught me.
lt got it hidden under my pillow.

30
00:03:02,698 --> 00:03:05,868
Try to be helpful.
l promised l'd return it today.

31
00:03:06,034 --> 00:03:10,330
Ask Daphne. She wanted
something to put her to sleep.

32
00:03:10,497 --> 00:03:13,792
That book could put her into a coma!

33
00:04:28,449 --> 00:04:30,952
- Dr Crane!
- Daphne!

34
00:04:31,119 --> 00:04:33,705
What are you doing in my room?

35
00:04:33,872 --> 00:04:38,668
You were out. Not that l
come in here when you're out.

36
00:04:38,835 --> 00:04:42,922
l came in to get my book.
Which l have, you see.

37
00:04:44,757 --> 00:04:46,801
We'll just be going.

38
00:04:46,968 --> 00:04:50,513
Me and my book. See Frasier go.

39
00:04:54,350 --> 00:05:00,148
Nadia, tell Mrs Crane l want to speak to
her and don't take no for an answer.

40
00:05:01,274 --> 00:05:07,113
Then tell her Dr Crane says
please, please, please, please...

41
00:05:11,826 --> 00:05:16,289
- Maris hung up on you?
- She's got Nadia doing her dirty work.

42
00:05:16,455 --> 00:05:19,625
Nadia is Maris's hatchet maid.

43
00:05:20,685 --> 00:05:23,313
What happened
to the French guy party?

44
00:05:23,479 --> 00:05:30,403
Disaster too. A branch of Maris' family
was slaughtered by the Huguenots.

45
00:05:32,655 --> 00:05:38,953
Let's forget about Maris and have
a nice meal in a convivial atmosphere.

46
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,334
- What is she mad about?
- Beats me.

47
00:05:45,501 --> 00:05:48,504
Your favourite, Mr Crane.
Creamed onions.

48
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:52,550
And Dr Crane, special glazed carrots
just for you.

49
00:05:52,717 --> 00:05:55,011
You, carve!

50
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,101
We don't know what she's mad at
but we know who.

51
00:06:02,268 --> 00:06:04,979
lf anyone needs me l'll be in me room.

52
00:06:05,146 --> 00:06:07,982
You know where that is!

53
00:06:09,942 --> 00:06:13,446
- What did you do?
- l went into her bedroom.

54
00:06:13,612 --> 00:06:16,198
Frasier, how could you!

55
00:06:20,453 --> 00:06:26,584
No matter how irresistible the urge
to press your face against the door,

56
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:31,505
to actually feel the grain
of the wood against your cheek,

57
00:06:31,672 --> 00:06:33,883
it must be fought!

58
00:06:37,261 --> 00:06:39,555
l went in to retrieve my book.

59
00:06:39,722 --> 00:06:43,851
- You're not supposed to go in there.
- What's the big deal?

60
00:06:44,018 --> 00:06:47,354
- She doesn't like people in there.
- l let her in my room.

61
00:06:47,521 --> 00:06:50,024
- Women are different.
- That's sexism.

62
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:54,278
No, it's 35 years of marriage talking.
Women protect their privacy.

63
00:06:54,445 --> 00:06:59,158
You never go in their handbags.
lt's always, ''Bring me my purse.''

64
00:06:59,324 --> 00:07:03,162
A husband is being robbed
at gunpoint and has no money.

65
00:07:03,328 --> 00:07:06,331
The wife still says, ''Bring me my purse.''

66
00:07:10,168 --> 00:07:15,841
Your homespun wisdom has pricked
the balloon of Frasier's pomposity.

67
00:07:17,551 --> 00:07:21,305
You were wrong,
so go in there and apologise. Go on.

68
00:07:21,471 --> 00:07:26,518
All right. l'll go into Daphne's room
and l will apologise to her.

69
00:07:28,061 --> 00:07:30,439
Alone, Niles!

70
00:07:37,779 --> 00:07:41,199
- Yes?
- Daphne, it's Dr Crane.

71
00:07:41,366 --> 00:07:43,410
Yes.

72
00:07:44,578 --> 00:07:47,330
Could you open the door, please?

73
00:07:55,797 --> 00:08:00,510
l behaved very insensitively
this morning and...

74
00:08:00,677 --> 00:08:05,432
l did need the book but it was wrong
of me to go in without your permission...

75
00:08:09,602 --> 00:08:11,980
...and l'm sorry.

76
00:08:17,694 --> 00:08:20,238
lt'll never happen again.

77
00:08:21,281 --> 00:08:23,241
Ever.

78
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,661
l'm being very nice.

79
00:08:29,414 --> 00:08:32,250
Well, good night, Daphne.

80
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:38,214
Wait. l'm being much too hard on you.

81
00:08:38,381 --> 00:08:40,842
l'm sensitive about my privacy.

82
00:08:41,009 --> 00:08:44,762
No need to explain.
lt will never be an issue again.

83
00:08:44,929 --> 00:08:47,473
Thank you for being so understanding.

84
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:51,269
My problem goes back to growing up
in a house of boys.

85
00:08:51,436 --> 00:08:55,439
My brothers were snoops.
They gave me no peace.

86
00:08:55,606 --> 00:08:58,943
lt was a filthy rite of passage
for the Moon boys.

87
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:03,322
They'd sneak into the bathroom
and peek at me in the shower.

88
00:09:03,489 --> 00:09:06,200
Dear God. All eight of them?

89
00:09:06,367 --> 00:09:10,538
Except for my brother Billy,
the ballroom dancer.

90
00:09:13,124 --> 00:09:18,462
He never peeked at me. Though
he did peek at my brother Nigel.

91
00:09:26,929 --> 00:09:28,722
(Frasier) Coffee, Dad?
(Martin) Why not?

92
00:09:28,889 --> 00:09:32,685
l'm up six times a night.
l might as well be alert.

93
00:09:38,148 --> 00:09:41,318
Jeez, the disposal's jammed.

94
00:09:41,485 --> 00:09:45,322
Stick your hand down there
and see what's stuck, will you?

95
00:09:46,657 --> 00:09:48,701
Dad, it's me, Niles.

96
00:09:48,867 --> 00:09:51,161
l can't get my hand in.

97
00:09:51,328 --> 00:09:54,081
Punish a man for being fine-boned.

98
00:09:54,248 --> 00:09:57,084
- Sure it's off?
- Positive.

99
00:09:57,251 --> 00:09:59,920
Move away from the switch.

100
00:10:02,548 --> 00:10:07,427
lt's wet and slimy. Like sticking
my hand into the mouth of hell.

101
00:10:07,594 --> 00:10:09,638
(Grinder whirs)

102
00:10:17,563 --> 00:10:20,274
Call me when the coffee's ready.

103
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:24,569
- Sorry, Niles.
- That's enough excitement.

104
00:10:24,736 --> 00:10:27,906
- l'm going home to Maris.
- She's speaking to you?

105
00:10:28,073 --> 00:10:31,368
No but she tires
of being frosty to the help.

106
00:10:31,535 --> 00:10:36,289
l'm out of cash. l need something
to tip your garage attendant.

107
00:10:36,456 --> 00:10:39,876
Oh, great. These pills.

108
00:10:40,043 --> 00:10:43,588
l was thinking money
but you know him better than l do.

109
00:10:47,175 --> 00:10:50,303
No, no. Daphne's prescription.

110
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:54,599
When l was in her room
l must have inadvertently...

111
00:10:54,766 --> 00:10:57,602
knocked them into my pocket.

112
00:10:57,769 --> 00:11:00,146
An interesting phenomenon.

113
00:11:00,313 --> 00:11:05,193
l can't go into a drugstore without
aspirin leaping into my trousers.

114
00:11:06,528 --> 00:11:10,532
OK, l was snooping around a little bit.

115
00:11:11,658 --> 00:11:15,954
Oh, God. ''Take one before bedtime''.
She'll miss these.

116
00:11:17,455 --> 00:11:19,791
- You off, Dr Crane?
- Yes, l am.

117
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:22,710
- Say hello to your wife.
- l'll try.

118
00:11:24,129 --> 00:11:27,257
Mr Crane, time for your exercises.

119
00:11:27,423 --> 00:11:30,260
Great. l'll just
put these back in her room.

120
00:11:31,135 --> 00:11:33,179
Alone, Niles!

121
00:11:36,724 --> 00:11:40,061
The game's on. l'll exercise tomorrow.

122
00:11:40,228 --> 00:11:42,438
Fine. l'll be in my room.

123
00:11:48,444 --> 00:11:52,156
- You'll do double tomorrow.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

124
00:11:55,952 --> 00:11:58,579
Grumpy old sod.

125
00:12:03,709 --> 00:12:05,753
(Daphne sings)

126
00:13:55,946 --> 00:13:59,282
What're you doing? That's disgusting!

127
00:13:59,449 --> 00:14:02,494
You filthy thing. Get out!

128
00:14:02,661 --> 00:14:04,913
Daphne, l'm so sorry!

129
00:14:14,631 --> 00:14:17,467
Good morning, Frasier.

130
00:14:17,634 --> 00:14:21,679
<i>Cara mia, un mezzo latte decaffeinato
and a bran muffin.</i>

131
00:14:21,846 --> 00:14:26,184
<i>No, no... due bran muffins.</i>

132
00:14:28,686 --> 00:14:33,483
Maris and l burned up a lot of
energy last night. A lot of energy.

133
00:14:34,526 --> 00:14:37,362
<i>l have to replenish ma body.</i>

134
00:14:39,572 --> 00:14:42,200
<i>You achieved détente?</i>

135
00:14:42,784 --> 00:14:44,619
Twice.

136
00:14:46,537 --> 00:14:50,124
What did you say to melt
your little glacier?

137
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:52,960
l stared deeply into her eyes and said,

138
00:14:53,127 --> 00:14:57,256
''Maris, here are the keys
to your new Mercedes.''

139
00:14:58,508 --> 00:15:00,510
You bought her a Mercedes.

140
00:15:00,676 --> 00:15:04,347
Yes. The things that tiny woman
can do when motivated.

141
00:15:05,097 --> 00:15:09,685
lf you're done marinating in
your testosterone, l have a problem.

142
00:15:09,852 --> 00:15:12,688
Remember l went back
into Daphne's room?

143
00:15:12,855 --> 00:15:15,733
- She caught me again.
- You're joking!

144
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:21,572
l was so embarrassed, l left before
she awoke. l wrote a note to explain.

145
00:15:21,739 --> 00:15:25,618
Considering the circumstances,
how can she forgive me?

146
00:15:25,785 --> 00:15:28,037
lt wasn't as bad as all that.

147
00:15:28,204 --> 00:15:31,665
lt's not like you saw her naked
or something.

148
00:15:39,715 --> 00:15:42,510
You did!

149
00:15:42,676 --> 00:15:48,224
l took no pleasure in it at all.
The entire thing was mortifying.

150
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:53,354
l want to help you, so tell me
everything before you explode.

151
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,397
No, Niles!

152
00:15:55,564 --> 00:15:59,151
l'll show you how l imagine her
and you tell me where l'm wrong.

153
00:15:59,318 --> 00:16:02,321
Stop it. Put your pen away!

154
00:16:03,364 --> 00:16:07,117
- Hey, guys.
- Hello, Roz, good to see you.

155
00:16:08,911 --> 00:16:14,416
So, Niles, you randy dog.
You got lucky last night, didn't you?

156
00:16:15,876 --> 00:16:17,878
l can always tell.

157
00:16:18,045 --> 00:16:21,089
Don't worry. You'll meet somebody.

158
00:16:22,508 --> 00:16:25,135
A non-fat cap, please.

159
00:16:25,302 --> 00:16:29,473
Roz, this was private. l'm helping
with a matter of some delicacy.

160
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:33,560
Don't worry.
Shower boy told me about it.

161
00:16:33,727 --> 00:16:37,105
How can l make this up to Daphne?

162
00:16:37,272 --> 00:16:41,610
Nothing says sorry like an in-dash
CD player and a passenger airbag.

163
00:16:41,777 --> 00:16:45,280
Maris was upset
so he bought her a Mercedes.

164
00:16:46,448 --> 00:16:51,036
You're suggesting l buy my way out.
That's the coward's way out.

165
00:16:51,203 --> 00:16:53,914
- So l'm a coward?
- Yes.

166
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,333
Well, l'm a coward with a hickey.

167
00:17:01,004 --> 00:17:05,759
Buy me a Mercedes, l'll make your
neck look like a relief map of the Andes.

168
00:17:06,885 --> 00:17:11,181
Don't encourage him! Bribery is
the wrong way to resolve conflicts.

169
00:17:11,348 --> 00:17:14,392
During which failed marriage
did you hone that theory?

170
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:18,229
How dare you,
considering your non-marriage!

171
00:17:24,152 --> 00:17:28,031
Dr Crane, l'm glad to see you.
l need some advice.

172
00:17:28,198 --> 00:17:31,159
l got this son
who's a total numbnut.

173
00:17:34,078 --> 00:17:36,581
Hello, Dad. Love your icebreaker.

174
00:17:36,748 --> 00:17:40,877
Get her to stay.
She knows my moods and l like her.

175
00:17:41,044 --> 00:17:45,381
- She's talking about quitting?
- Yeah, so get in there and apologise.

176
00:17:45,548 --> 00:17:47,842
Dad, l can't go in there.

177
00:17:48,009 --> 00:17:51,095
No you can't, because l asked you to.

178
00:17:51,262 --> 00:17:56,142
l said, ''Don't go,'' you went.
l say, ''Go,'' you won't.

179
00:17:56,309 --> 00:18:00,229
Unlike Eddie, he does what l say.
Come on, Eddie.

180
00:18:04,984 --> 00:18:07,445
He's defying you too, Dad.

181
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:16,829
Daphne, please wait.
We've got to talk. l feel terrible.

182
00:18:16,996 --> 00:18:21,167
Dr Crane,
your note explained everything.

183
00:18:21,334 --> 00:18:23,920
You've nothing to feel bad about.

184
00:18:24,086 --> 00:18:29,050
- That puts my mind at ease.
- We servants don't deserve privacy.

185
00:18:29,216 --> 00:18:33,220
Matter of fact, why don't
we get it out in the open?

186
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:39,101
Here's my bank book, letters,
and my driver's licence.

187
00:18:39,268 --> 00:18:42,063
You see l'm 4lbs heavier now,

188
00:18:42,229 --> 00:18:46,484
but it's in a spot that
doesn't show...to most people!

189
00:18:47,735 --> 00:18:51,405
l realise it's hard
to live in someone else's home.

190
00:18:51,572 --> 00:18:57,369
Yes, it is. But l put up with it
because l happen to love this job.

191
00:18:57,536 --> 00:19:03,208
All l ever asked for was one room,
a little corner l could call my own.

192
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:05,878
l never minded l was up to my eyeballs

193
00:19:06,045 --> 00:19:09,631
in your earth tones
and African knick-knacks.

194
00:19:09,798 --> 00:19:15,137
But l have to put up with you
and that's a leering love god too many!

195
00:19:15,304 --> 00:19:21,101
Oh, Daphne. You're right,
you do deserve a place of your own.

196
00:19:21,268 --> 00:19:25,230
lf you stay, l'll pay
to have your room redecorated.

197
00:19:25,397 --> 00:19:31,904
Just make it your own. Paint, wallpaper.
Anything so you feel comfortable.

198
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:37,034
How about an electrified fence
and a German police dog?

199
00:19:38,368 --> 00:19:41,788
l promise as long as
we live under the same roof,

200
00:19:41,955 --> 00:19:45,417
l'll never set foot in your room again.

201
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:49,963
- All right.
- Thank you.

202
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:52,632
- l'll give it another try.
- (Doorbell)

203
00:19:53,633 --> 00:19:57,596
- Hello.
- Hello and goodbye, Dr Crane.

204
00:19:57,763 --> 00:19:59,931
- Where are you off to?
- Shopping.

205
00:20:00,098 --> 00:20:03,059
Your brother offered to
have my room redecorated.

206
00:20:03,226 --> 00:20:05,103
Really?

207
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:11,860
l'm thinking of doing the whole thing
in pinks and yellows.

208
00:20:12,944 --> 00:20:16,531
She's really determined
to keep me out of there.

209
00:20:17,407 --> 00:20:22,287
So...you're putting things right
by opening your chequebook.

210
00:20:22,454 --> 00:20:26,541
l know what you're thinking.
lt's just a gesture.

211
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:32,255
l give Maris a car, it's a bribe. You
decorate Daphne's room, it's a gesture.

212
00:20:32,422 --> 00:20:37,677
lt's different. You bought Maris off
because you are afraid of her.

213
00:20:37,844 --> 00:20:42,140
And you're not the slightest bit
intimidated by Daphne.

214
00:20:42,307 --> 00:20:46,186
So you won't be alarmed if l do this.

215
00:20:46,352 --> 00:20:48,396
Niles, where are you going?

216
00:20:49,564 --> 00:20:53,151
- My foot's in Daphne's room.
- Get out.

217
00:20:53,318 --> 00:20:56,029
Afraid you'll get in...trouble?

218
00:20:57,071 --> 00:20:59,574
- Now we're safe.
- Stop it!

219
00:20:59,741 --> 00:21:02,577
Trouble...safe...trouble...safe.

220
00:21:02,744 --> 00:21:05,121
Niles, you're acting like a child.

221
00:21:05,288 --> 00:21:09,834
- Trouble, safe, trouble, safe...
- See what you've done.

222
00:21:10,001 --> 00:21:14,297
Oh, well, so you'll just write her
a bigger, fatter cheque.

223
00:21:14,464 --> 00:21:16,257
No, Niles, she'll quit!

224
00:21:16,424 --> 00:21:19,677
- What! Why didn't you say?
- Oh, you spilled...

225
00:21:21,888 --> 00:21:26,309
- What the hell are you doing?
- lt's Niles's fault.

226
00:21:55,337 --> 00:22:00,134
Daphne, did you see that sporty
little sub-compact over there?

227
00:22:03,178 --> 00:22:07,349
ls that a Mercedes dealership
across the street?

228
00:22:16,483 --> 00:22:22,114
# Hey baby, l hear the blues are calling
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

229
00:22:22,281 --> 00:22:23,449
# Quite stylish!

230
00:22:23,615 --> 00:22:30,581
# And maybe l seem a bit confused
Well, maybe, but l got you pegged

231
00:22:30,747 --> 00:22:36,420
# But l don't know what to do with those
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

232
00:22:36,587 --> 00:22:39,089
# They're calling again #

233
00:22:39,256 --> 00:22:42,217
Good night everybody!
