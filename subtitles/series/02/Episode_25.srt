1
00:00:10,618 --> 00:00:14,664
(Frasier) 'l just opened up the pages of
''Seattle'' magazine and there she was. '

2
00:00:14,831 --> 00:00:19,794
Oh, my! Who is this fresh angel?
Madeline Marshall?

3
00:00:19,961 --> 00:00:23,631
Would you be so good
as to have dinner with me tonight?

4
00:00:23,798 --> 00:00:27,510
l was wondering about us
going away for the weekend.

5
00:00:27,677 --> 00:00:29,345
l'm in love.

6
00:00:29,512 --> 00:00:34,017
'So off l flew to Bora Bora,
and did l receive the shock of my life?'

7
00:00:34,183 --> 00:00:37,228
(Beckons seductively) Frasier.

8
00:00:42,483 --> 00:00:45,236
- Oh, my God!
- Frasier?

9
00:00:47,655 --> 00:00:49,949
Oh, my God!

10
00:00:54,996 --> 00:00:59,542
- Lilith, what are you doing here?
- l could ask you the same thing.

11
00:00:59,709 --> 00:01:03,171
- (Madeline ) ls everything all right?
- Yes...

12
00:01:03,337 --> 00:01:05,923
Come out and join us, Madeline.

13
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:08,926
Are you here with someone?

14
00:01:09,093 --> 00:01:11,971
Yes. He's snorkelling at the moment.

15
00:01:12,805 --> 00:01:14,849
- Anyone l know?
- Sam Malone.

16
00:01:15,016 --> 00:01:16,517
Sam?

17
00:01:18,269 --> 00:01:22,690
- Just kidding.
- Why did you bring him here?

18
00:01:23,774 --> 00:01:28,279
lt was spectacular five years ago
when you brought me.

19
00:01:28,446 --> 00:01:32,992
But this was our place.
How could you bring someone else?

20
00:01:35,494 --> 00:01:38,330
Lilith, l'd like you to meet
Madeline Marshall.

21
00:01:38,497 --> 00:01:41,792
How's this for a hoot?
This is my ex-wife, Lilith.

22
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:44,753
- Your ex-wife is here?
- Yes.

23
00:01:45,754 --> 00:01:48,966
What a shame, too:
no papers to be signed.

24
00:01:50,593 --> 00:01:54,388
- So you're here with someone?
- Why does everyone keep asking that?

25
00:01:54,555 --> 00:01:57,141
Here he comes now. Brian?

26
00:01:57,641 --> 00:02:01,895
Dr Brian Patchett, l'd like you
to meet Madeline Marshall

27
00:02:02,104 --> 00:02:04,398
and Dr Frasier Crane.

28
00:02:04,565 --> 00:02:08,444
- Your ex-husband? You're joking.
- No, God is.

29
00:02:09,403 --> 00:02:11,655
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Likewise.

30
00:02:11,822 --> 00:02:14,658
Brian is a seismologist at MlT.

31
00:02:14,825 --> 00:02:19,663
Perfect, Brian being a seismologist
and you having so many faults.

32
00:02:24,585 --> 00:02:26,920
Lilith, you're laughing!

33
00:02:27,087 --> 00:02:30,090
l laugh a lot these days,
thanks to Brian.

34
00:02:30,257 --> 00:02:35,721
Madeline is just hilarious. She also
designs her own line of sportswear.

35
00:02:35,887 --> 00:02:38,432
l don't think l've ever worn sportswear.

36
00:02:39,766 --> 00:02:41,852
So, how long are you staying?

37
00:02:42,019 --> 00:02:44,312
Until Tuesday.

38
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:46,982
We're here till Wednesday.

39
00:02:59,578 --> 00:03:02,122
This has the potential
to be very awkward.

40
00:03:02,289 --> 00:03:06,501
Why don't we defuse the situation
by having cocktails later?

41
00:03:06,668 --> 00:03:09,671
- Let's have dinner.
- Wonderful idea!

42
00:03:09,838 --> 00:03:12,716
- Let's meet in the Tiki room at six.
- Great.

43
00:03:12,882 --> 00:03:16,636
Looking forward to it.
A wonderful way to start out

44
00:03:16,803 --> 00:03:20,056
what promises to be a great week.

45
00:03:26,646 --> 00:03:30,483
- You see how Mr Perfect rubbed it in?
- Relax.

46
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:35,280
Climbing a tree to get a coconut
when there were three on the ground!

47
00:03:36,656 --> 00:03:40,326
Would you stop obsessing?
Come here.

48
00:03:41,536 --> 00:03:43,580
OK.

49
00:03:49,085 --> 00:03:51,671
- Hold it. What's that?
- What?

50
00:03:51,838 --> 00:03:54,549
Lilith is making love.

51
00:03:56,175 --> 00:03:58,803
- l don't hear a thing.
- Exactly!

52
00:04:03,683 --> 00:04:07,395
Would you just concentrate on me,
please?

53
00:04:07,562 --> 00:04:12,817
You're right. lt's not like in college
when that went on in the next room

54
00:04:12,984 --> 00:04:17,071
and l was all alone
with my Henry Miller collection.

55
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:23,369
l've just got to block it out of my mind,
focus on the task at hand.

56
00:04:24,036 --> 00:04:27,206
Oh, that's sexy.

57
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:32,128
You're right. Forgive me.

58
00:04:33,629 --> 00:04:36,716
You want sexy? l'll show you sexy.

59
00:04:42,763 --> 00:04:45,266
- l feel dirty.
- Good.

60
00:04:46,267 --> 00:04:49,353
No, l mean sandy,
from sitting on the beach.

61
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,689
Just let me take a shower.

62
00:04:51,856 --> 00:04:54,441
OK. Don't be long.

63
00:04:54,608 --> 00:04:58,696
Then l'll make you forget
you were ever married to Lilith.

64
00:04:58,862 --> 00:05:03,409
That's never happened before
without a prescription.

65
00:05:09,623 --> 00:05:12,209
Oh, yeah.

66
00:05:12,376 --> 00:05:14,628
Oh, yeah!

67
00:05:21,426 --> 00:05:23,387
Oh, yeah.

68
00:05:26,098 --> 00:05:29,142
Ohh!
lt's never been like this before!

69
00:05:30,394 --> 00:05:32,229
Never!

70
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:37,818
Nothing! Damn her!
She can give as good as she gets!

71
00:05:39,403 --> 00:05:41,446
Oh, yeah.

72
00:05:42,155 --> 00:05:45,742
Oh, yeah!
Ohh! Oh, Mama!

73
00:05:46,743 --> 00:05:50,539
Oh, God! You are so hot!
l am burning up!

74
00:05:50,747 --> 00:05:53,917
That's it! That's it! Yes!

75
00:05:54,084 --> 00:05:56,378
Yes! Oh, my God, yes!

76
00:05:56,545 --> 00:05:59,548
Keep it up, baby!
Oh, you're killing me!

77
00:05:59,714 --> 00:06:03,093
Oh, God, you're an animal!
Yes! Yes!

78
00:06:10,976 --> 00:06:13,019
Obviously you don't need me.

79
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:23,071
Before we go to Chopper Dave
for a traffic report,

80
00:06:23,238 --> 00:06:26,741
l'd like to send this message
to Madeline M.

81
00:06:26,908 --> 00:06:33,331
l'm sure your gentleman would love
an opportunity to explain his behaviour,

82
00:06:33,498 --> 00:06:37,043
but you left the island
before he had a chance...

83
00:06:38,878 --> 00:06:42,966
...and you won't return his calls
or answer his notes.

84
00:06:44,092 --> 00:06:48,012
We all know how hard it is
to find love in this world

85
00:06:48,179 --> 00:06:52,433
and what a tragedy it is
to let it slip through our fingers.

86
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,478
l think he really cares about you.

87
00:06:56,521 --> 00:07:00,566
This is Dr Frasier Crane.
We'll be back in a moment.

88
00:07:00,733 --> 00:07:03,986
- You were wonderful!
- You think she'll call?

89
00:07:04,153 --> 00:07:07,740
- lf she doesn't, she has no heart.
- Thank you, Roz.

90
00:07:07,907 --> 00:07:12,912
l almost forgot. This bill came
for you from your hotel in Bora Bora.

91
00:07:13,788 --> 00:07:17,291
l guess they had to charge me
for the whole week.

92
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:20,670
No, that's for the bed you trashed.

93
00:07:20,836 --> 00:07:23,130
$2,500 for bamboo?

94
00:07:26,425 --> 00:07:30,680
Hello? This is Dr Frasier Crane.
Roz, whom do we have next?

95
00:07:30,846 --> 00:07:33,849
We have Vic from Seattle
on line three.

96
00:07:34,016 --> 00:07:38,396
- Hello, Vic. l'm listening.
- (Vic ) 'Hi. Thanks for taking my call.

97
00:07:38,562 --> 00:07:41,857
- 'l'm a little nervous.'
- Just relax, Vic.

98
00:07:42,024 --> 00:07:45,361
- l'm listening.
- 'l have a problem with women.'

99
00:07:45,528 --> 00:07:48,656
Frasier, Madeline's on line one.

100
00:07:48,823 --> 00:07:50,866
'Dr Crane?'

101
00:07:51,033 --> 00:07:53,619
Vic, something's come up
in the booth.

102
00:07:53,786 --> 00:07:57,248
l'll have to turn you over
to my capable producer.

103
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:03,045
Madeline, hi! Thanks for calling.

104
00:08:03,212 --> 00:08:05,923
No, it's OK. l'm off the air now.

105
00:08:06,924 --> 00:08:09,593
So, Vic, what's your problem
with women?

106
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:13,472
'l don't know. l have a good job,
a good personality, l think.

107
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:18,394
'l made more money as a model,
but l'm doing OK at the law firm.'

108
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,729
Tell me more.

109
00:08:24,566 --> 00:08:27,861
Maris is thrilled
you're seeing the ballet.

110
00:08:28,028 --> 00:08:30,113
- We're delighted.
- Yeah.

111
00:08:31,031 --> 00:08:34,826
When l was younger,
l dreamed of being a ballerina.

112
00:08:34,993 --> 00:08:39,206
So did Maris. But she could
never get her weight up.

113
00:08:42,042 --> 00:08:47,422
That's why l bought this walk-on part
at the fundraiser as a gift for Maris.

114
00:08:47,589 --> 00:08:52,552
- So Maris is going to be a ballerina?
- lt's non-dancing, but a key role.

115
00:08:52,719 --> 00:08:57,307
She plays Ulrich,
the hunchbacked drawbridge operator.

116
00:08:58,934 --> 00:09:01,269
l hope we can pick her out.

117
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:08,485
- What are you still doing here?
- We'll be gone before she gets here.

118
00:09:08,652 --> 00:09:11,446
- You don't want to be late.
- l do.

119
00:09:11,613 --> 00:09:16,284
With those ballet guys in tight pants,
l don't know where to look.

120
00:09:16,451 --> 00:09:20,497
That reminds me.
l've got to bring my binoculars.

121
00:09:20,664 --> 00:09:24,376
- Will you just get out of here?
- Frasier, relax.

122
00:09:24,542 --> 00:09:28,838
This is my last chance.
lt serves me right after Bora Bora.

123
00:09:29,005 --> 00:09:31,674
You're being too hard on yourself.

124
00:09:31,841 --> 00:09:34,594
How were you to know
Lilith was there?

125
00:09:34,761 --> 00:09:40,141
Aside from the seas starting to churn
and all the birds taking flight.

126
00:09:41,768 --> 00:09:45,146
Don't worry.
Miss Marshall will forgive you.

127
00:09:45,313 --> 00:09:49,567
Women appreciate a man
who's sensitive enough to try again.

128
00:09:49,734 --> 00:09:52,403
That's why they call us ''the fair sex''.

129
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:56,950
All right, then, let's go see
some leaping Russian stags.

130
00:09:58,534 --> 00:10:01,871
- Oh, hi, Maddie!
- Hello.

131
00:10:02,038 --> 00:10:04,582
- We were just leaving.
- Come in.

132
00:10:04,749 --> 00:10:09,545
You two kids take your time.
We'll be out all evening.

133
00:10:09,712 --> 00:10:14,675
You know how it is: first the ballet,
then the inevitable discussion.

134
00:10:22,808 --> 00:10:26,437
- That was a little awkward, huh?
- So is this.

135
00:10:27,688 --> 00:10:31,525
l'd better launch into my little speech

136
00:10:31,692 --> 00:10:34,445
to explain
why l behaved the way l did.

137
00:10:34,612 --> 00:10:38,032
No, l'll tell you
how l've got it worked out:

138
00:10:38,199 --> 00:10:42,745
when you saw Lilith, you wanted
to leave, but l wouldn't let you.

139
00:10:42,912 --> 00:10:47,041
You said you couldn't handle it
and, by God, you were right.

140
00:10:49,293 --> 00:10:52,797
You panicked
and your panic took a bad turn.

141
00:10:52,963 --> 00:10:55,049
A spectacularly bad turn.

142
00:10:55,216 --> 00:11:00,137
That's how l've got it worked out.
lt's fragile, so don't mess with it.

143
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:06,143
So, why don't you mix up a pitcher
of Mai Tais and give me a kiss?

144
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:09,355
l'll let you guess which l want first.

145
00:11:11,941 --> 00:11:14,276
Guess again.

146
00:11:24,161 --> 00:11:26,497
Delicious. l love mangoes.

147
00:11:26,663 --> 00:11:30,709
We never got round to sampling them
on the islands.

148
00:11:30,876 --> 00:11:34,630
- So l thought we should now.
- Good thinking.

149
00:11:39,092 --> 00:11:43,180
There's something else
we never got around to in Bora Bora.

150
00:11:43,347 --> 00:11:45,849
You got around to it. l just watched.

151
00:11:51,438 --> 00:11:55,609
How about a little
audience participation this time?

152
00:12:01,531 --> 00:12:03,575
Frasier, wait.

153
00:12:03,742 --> 00:12:06,828
l want this as much as you,
but l need to talk to you first.

154
00:12:06,995 --> 00:12:08,830
What?

155
00:12:08,997 --> 00:12:14,336
l thought l was comfortable with this
and wouldn't have to bring it up.

156
00:12:15,629 --> 00:12:18,715
l was involved
with a divorced man before.

157
00:12:18,882 --> 00:12:23,428
Just when l was falling for him,
he reconciled with his ex-wife.

158
00:12:23,595 --> 00:12:25,931
l can't go through that again.

159
00:12:27,349 --> 00:12:32,812
lt's all right, Madeline. Trust me.
Lilith and l are completely finished.

160
00:12:32,979 --> 00:12:35,648
She lives on the other side
of the country.

161
00:12:35,815 --> 00:12:38,818
Except in matters of our son,
we don't have contact.

162
00:12:39,944 --> 00:12:42,614
That's all l wanted to hear.

163
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:56,753
Well, what's your name, little fellow?

164
00:13:05,094 --> 00:13:07,764
You promise you won't laugh?

165
00:13:17,231 --> 00:13:22,195
The dog... His name is Eddie.

166
00:13:23,654 --> 00:13:28,117
Come on. Pardon me while l put him
back where he belongs.

167
00:13:28,284 --> 00:13:30,786
l'll be waiting.

168
00:13:36,667 --> 00:13:38,878
(Door knocks)

169
00:13:47,011 --> 00:13:49,055
Oh, God!

170
00:13:49,889 --> 00:13:53,434
lt's nice to see you, too.
ls Frasier here?

171
00:13:53,601 --> 00:13:57,646
- Don't you live in Boston?
- l'm here on a layover.

172
00:13:57,813 --> 00:14:02,776
And, judging by Frasier's trademark
mangoes on a stick, so are you.

173
00:14:08,282 --> 00:14:11,577
lf you like, l can come back
in ten minutes.

174
00:14:15,456 --> 00:14:19,668
- That won't be necessary.
- l apologise for being inopportune.

175
00:14:19,835 --> 00:14:22,963
We've agreed
to make time for each other

176
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:26,008
if we have something
urgent to discuss.

177
00:14:26,884 --> 00:14:29,094
Take all the time you need.

178
00:14:30,012 --> 00:14:33,807
This whole thing's
just a little too complicated for me.

179
00:15:02,711 --> 00:15:05,172
Put down that mango, my dear.

180
00:15:05,338 --> 00:15:08,216
lt's time you tasted the forbidden fruit.

181
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:22,355
- Lilith! What are you doing here?
- l have something urgent to discuss.

182
00:15:22,522 --> 00:15:25,567
What have you done with Madeline?

183
00:15:26,484 --> 00:15:30,947
She was surprised to see me and left.
l hope you're not angry.

184
00:15:31,114 --> 00:15:34,659
Angry?
What do l have to be angry about?

185
00:15:34,826 --> 00:15:39,831
l carve out a slice of happiness
for myself and you obliterate it.

186
00:15:39,998 --> 00:15:44,836
l'd drive a stake through your heart,
but l don't think it could kill you.

187
00:15:50,633 --> 00:15:55,013
- Brian asked me to marry him.
- What?

188
00:15:56,681 --> 00:16:00,310
He wants to stop in Las Vegas
on our way home.

189
00:16:01,728 --> 00:16:05,064
- You're getting married?
- Yes.

190
00:16:05,231 --> 00:16:07,066
Well...

191
00:16:07,984 --> 00:16:09,819
So am l.

192
00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:16,784
- Really?
- Yes, yes, to Madeline.

193
00:16:16,951 --> 00:16:21,122
She seemed in an awful hurry
for someone who's getting married.

194
00:16:21,289 --> 00:16:23,541
She had to buy a dress.

195
00:16:26,002 --> 00:16:28,379
Oh, God, what am l doing?

196
00:16:29,422 --> 00:16:34,010
- l'm not getting married.
- Wow, you really had me going.

197
00:16:36,262 --> 00:16:39,181
Frasier,
l don't want to disrupt anything.

198
00:16:39,348 --> 00:16:41,893
l just came to get your blessing.

199
00:16:42,977 --> 00:16:45,146
l could have given it over the phone.

200
00:16:46,063 --> 00:16:49,400
- Must you be so churlish?
- l think l'm entitled.

201
00:16:49,567 --> 00:16:53,863
The one comfort in being divorced
is that you're both losers.

202
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:58,576
Eventually the time comes when
one person is the first to move on.

203
00:16:58,743 --> 00:17:01,537
Quite frankly,
l'd hoped it would be me.

204
00:17:02,747 --> 00:17:05,833
Well, l'd hoped it would be me,
and it was.

205
00:17:07,585 --> 00:17:10,337
But l'd like to think that,
the other way around,

206
00:17:10,504 --> 00:17:12,882
l would have been happy for you.

207
00:17:16,218 --> 00:17:18,596
lf you love him, l am happy for you.

208
00:17:18,762 --> 00:17:23,851
l do. Brian has been a dutiful suitor
and l'm convinced,

209
00:17:24,018 --> 00:17:28,105
to within an acceptable margin
of error, that he loves me.

210
00:17:33,902 --> 00:17:36,572
- Does Frederick like him?
- Yes.

211
00:17:36,739 --> 00:17:39,825
- Oh.
- Oh, Frasier.

212
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:44,997
Brian could never take your place
that way. You're Frederick's father.

213
00:17:49,126 --> 00:17:51,169
Congratulations.

214
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:57,259
Well, it looks like they made up.

215
00:18:07,102 --> 00:18:10,689
- Hello, everyone.
- Lilith, what a pleasant surprise!

216
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:12,774
How was Bora Bora?

217
00:18:14,776 --> 00:18:17,571
Never seen you looking so tan.

218
00:18:21,199 --> 00:18:24,995
My God,
what does she look like in winter?

219
00:18:25,162 --> 00:18:29,624
We have some happy news.
Lilith is going to be married again.

220
00:18:30,959 --> 00:18:33,461
- To who?
- Someone else.

221
00:18:33,628 --> 00:18:37,507
Oh, that's great! Congratulations!

222
00:18:37,716 --> 00:18:39,551
Wonderful!

223
00:18:43,596 --> 00:18:45,432
Oh. Yes.

224
00:18:45,598 --> 00:18:48,852
- Wonderful. When?
- Tomorrow in Las Vegas.

225
00:18:49,018 --> 00:18:52,731
Oh, Lilith!
How delightfully kitschy.

226
00:18:52,897 --> 00:18:55,942
You're poking fun at the institution

227
00:18:56,109 --> 00:19:00,530
by getting married
in the tackiest place possible.

228
00:19:03,449 --> 00:19:06,077
Brian's family lives in Las Vegas.

229
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,747
Well, isn't that convenient?

230
00:19:10,873 --> 00:19:14,168
You'll have someone
to show you the museums.

231
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:28,057
- lt was lovely seeing you again.
- l'll walk you out.

232
00:19:35,022 --> 00:19:38,151
l hope you haven't found this
too unsettling.

233
00:19:38,317 --> 00:19:43,239
No, no. lt's actually good
that you're getting remarried.

234
00:19:43,406 --> 00:19:47,285
We could have kept wondering
if we'd made a mistake,

235
00:19:47,451 --> 00:19:49,829
if we should have worked it out.

236
00:19:49,996 --> 00:19:54,417
Was it me? Was it you?
Was it us? Was it you?

237
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:00,840
- Now we can move on.
- What's next for you?

238
00:20:01,006 --> 00:20:04,218
l'll try to smooth things over
with Madeline.

239
00:20:04,427 --> 00:20:07,304
Try very hard. She seems worth it.

240
00:20:08,305 --> 00:20:13,060
She'll need convincing.
l could try asking her back to Bora Bora.

241
00:20:13,269 --> 00:20:18,524
l'll lay on the whole package:
buy the tickets, pay for the hotel,

242
00:20:18,691 --> 00:20:23,612
get a limo - champagne, caviar,
the whole nine yards.

243
00:20:23,779 --> 00:20:26,991
l'll sweep her off her feet
and into my bed.

244
00:20:28,284 --> 00:20:30,953
l do own it, you know.

245
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:39,545
- Would you like to kiss the bride?
- My pleasure.

246
00:20:42,631 --> 00:20:45,717
- You're really happy for me?
- Of course.

247
00:20:45,884 --> 00:20:49,012
You'll understand
if l don't jump up and down.

248
00:20:49,179 --> 00:20:51,974
Yes. l've already seen that.

249
00:21:12,244 --> 00:21:16,206
(Madeline ) Why don't we pick up
where we left off, Frasier?

250
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:24,214
- Oh, my God.
- Frasier?

251
00:21:24,423 --> 00:21:26,758
Oh, my God!

252
00:21:36,351 --> 00:21:38,687
Oh. Oh, my...

253
00:21:38,853 --> 00:21:42,983
Oh, God, l just had
the most frightening dream!

254
00:21:43,149 --> 00:21:45,402
Thank God l'm here with you!

255
00:21:49,322 --> 00:21:51,658
We have all week
to analyse your dream.

256
00:21:51,825 --> 00:21:54,411
Right now,
there's a huge bug in the shower.

257
00:22:09,425 --> 00:22:14,931
# Hey baby, l hear the blues a-calling
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

258
00:22:15,098 --> 00:22:16,474
# Quite stylish!

259
00:22:16,641 --> 00:22:23,564
# And maybe l seem a bit confused
Well, maybe...but l got you pegged!

260
00:22:23,731 --> 00:22:29,529
# But l don't know what to do with those
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

261
00:22:29,696 --> 00:22:31,823
# They're calling again #

262
00:22:31,989 --> 00:22:35,034
Frasier has left the building.
