1
00:00:16,058 --> 00:00:19,144
- What the hell are you doing?
- Ironing your son's socks.

2
00:00:19,311 --> 00:00:22,981
Why don't you twist them into balls
like you do mine?

3
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:27,194
He says it bruises the cashmere.
He likes them pressed, folded,

4
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:29,780
then neatly arranged in sock dividers.

5
00:00:29,947 --> 00:00:32,074
I saw them in a catalogue once,

6
00:00:32,241 --> 00:00:36,245
but couldn't imagine
who would buy such silly things.

7
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:38,705
Of course, I hadn't met Dr Crane yet.

8
00:00:39,248 --> 00:00:42,709
We thought there'd been
a mix-up at the hospital.

9
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:47,130
When Niles came along,
it shot that theory all to hell.

10
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:51,426
Oh, Dad, please. Coaster.

11
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:53,637
Your beer is sweating.

12
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:57,975
So am I. You want to
shove one of those under my can?

13
00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:02,980
(Doorbell rings)

14
00:01:03,105 --> 00:01:05,190
If he could, he would.

15
00:01:06,942 --> 00:01:08,986
Mrs Greenway,
what a pleasant surprise.

16
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:12,239
- That's him.
- Won't you come in?

17
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:15,742
I had to see him again,
but now I'm positive.

18
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:20,873
That is the horny little mixed breed
who got my Phoebe pregnant.

19
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:25,460
You can't just bust in here
accusing my dog.

20
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:29,423
I had to keep shooing him away
from Phoebe in the park!

21
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:34,344
Look at him. He doesn't care
whose life he's ruined!

22
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:38,223
All he cares about
is his own selfish pleasure!

23
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:43,478
You know your problem, Dorothea?
You got a bad attitude.

24
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:46,273
That's why nobody sits with you
in the park.

25
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:50,444
There's no way Eddie could be
the father. He's been neutered.

26
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:54,323
Oh, really?
Then how do you explain these?

27
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:56,533
Oh, my God!

28
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:04,082
- They're miniature Eddies!
- Aren't they adorable?

29
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:07,586
Well, I'm glad you think so,
because they're yours.

30
00:02:07,753 --> 00:02:12,925
Bad dog! Look what you did!
Here, take these.

31
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:17,638
Dad, I expect an explanation.
I thought Eddie had been fixed.

32
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,848
All you had to do was look.

33
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:23,685
Well, I'm glad to say
I've never been that bored.

34
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:27,898
- Couldn't you just eat 'em up?
- For God's sake. Don't love them.

35
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:31,026
They'll think they're staying.
Keep them off the couch.

36
00:02:31,193 --> 00:02:34,071
Why did you let him run in the park?

37
00:02:34,238 --> 00:02:37,950
Haven't you seen the way
he romances my towel warmer?

38
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:40,410
He's cooped up here all day.

39
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:43,497
In the park,
I let him get some exercise.

40
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:46,124
Apparently, that's not all he got.

41
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:49,670
I've found the perfect name for this one.

42
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:51,338
Stop!

43
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:55,050
Dogs only need names
if you plan to call them to you.

44
00:02:55,217 --> 00:03:01,014
Listen, you get right back in there,
you mangy little thing! My God!

45
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:05,227
I'm going to the radio station.
We'll talk when I get back.

46
00:03:05,394 --> 00:03:08,856
Oh, relax, Frasier. I'll have
Eddie taken care of tomorrow.

47
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:11,692
You better.
Daphne, give me that box.

48
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:13,902
Where are you taking them?

49
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:19,324
- To unload them at the station.
- Couldn't we keep them for a while?

50
00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:22,661
No. We don't want them
taking after their father.

51
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:25,122
It may be too late already.

52
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:29,626
Oh, for God's sake.
Stop staring at me!

53
00:03:35,257 --> 00:03:37,301
Hello, Roz. You look lovely.

54
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:40,888
- I don't want one.
- I didn't say anything.

55
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:44,766
Betty from accounting warned me.
Where did you find them?

56
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:50,480
In my living room.
These are Eddie's mongrel seed.

57
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:53,859
Do you know anybody
that wants six puppies?

58
00:03:54,026 --> 00:03:56,320
Six? All right, Eddie!

59
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:57,905
Please.

60
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:02,075
I've been in the hallway
for an hour trying to unload them.

61
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:06,622
- I haven't had any luck.
- Not everybody likes dogs.

62
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:11,627
Take me. I'm a cat person.
It's not like I'd buy a cat mug,

63
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:14,046
but I had a cat
when I was growing up.

64
00:04:14,213 --> 00:04:16,298
We were almost inseparable.

65
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:19,384
Muffles or Scruffles,
something like that.

66
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:24,973
You know, Roz,
it's possible there's a dog lover

67
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:28,060
inside you just dying to get out.
Don't you think so?

68
00:04:28,227 --> 00:04:30,479
Come on. Just take a look.

69
00:04:30,646 --> 00:04:34,149
Come on. Take a look.
Have a look.

70
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:40,864
Oh, he's adorable!
Oh, come here, little fella!

71
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:44,284
Oh. Aren't you
the cutest little thing?

72
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:46,119
Oh, yeah.

73
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:50,874
Give me a kiss. Give me a kiss.
Oh! I love you too.

74
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:53,085
There. Happy now?

75
00:04:57,339 --> 00:05:00,217
Roz,
how can you just toss him aside

76
00:05:00,384 --> 00:05:02,511
after such a tender display of affection?

77
00:05:02,678 --> 00:05:04,805
I can do it with men, too.

78
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:09,059
Come on.
It's time to start the show.

79
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:11,645
Phil, puppy! Puppy!

80
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:16,233
They're all on to me.
All right, you behave yourselves.

81
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:21,488
Hello, Seattle.
This is Dr Frasier Crane,

82
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:24,116
coming to you
from KACL 780 Talk Radio.

83
00:05:24,283 --> 00:05:26,743
I'll be with you
for the next three hours.

84
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,954
Roz, who's our first caller?

85
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:32,666
Rita is on line four.
She feels overwhelmed at home.

86
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,794
Hello, Rita. I'm listening.

87
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:38,005
(Rita) 'Yeah, Dr Crane.

88
00:05:38,172 --> 00:05:41,091
'Oh, Dr Crane,
thank you for taking my call.

89
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:43,385
'I...I tell you, I...

90
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:46,305
'I'm about to lose my mind.

91
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:48,974
'I am raising four kids by myself.

92
00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:53,854
'The oldest one is not even seven
and the others are under five.

93
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:57,816
'Between cooking, cleaning, changing
diapers and tripping over toys...

94
00:05:57,941 --> 00:06:02,362
'I...feel sometimes
like l am about to snap.

95
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:04,573
'What should I do?'

96
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:07,784
Have you considered getting a puppy?

97
00:06:13,207 --> 00:06:15,042
(Puppies whimper)

98
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:18,003
If we can't have this one,
are there any others available?

99
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:20,464
No. We found homes for the others.

100
00:06:20,631 --> 00:06:24,259
- Thanks for coming over.
- But the children. Dr Crane...

101
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:28,722
There are other dogs in the world.
Now, give me that.

102
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:32,726
Thank you for coming over.
Thank you.

103
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,980
I thought you might like
some wine and pâté.

104
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:39,858
I made some lemonade for the children.

105
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:48,617
Where are the Thomasons?
Why is that dog still here?

106
00:06:48,784 --> 00:06:51,870
I'm sorry, but they struck me
as unfit guardians.

107
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:55,624
For God's sake. He works at the zoo!

108
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:59,127
She's a nurse! Billy's an altar
boy and Kathy is a campfire girl!

109
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:01,797
They had a dark aura.

110
00:07:01,964 --> 00:07:05,676
They had a ten-acre farm!
I'd have gone with them!

111
00:07:05,843 --> 00:07:10,556
I see. So you want me to
give him away to just anybody?

112
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:12,224
(Doorbell)

113
00:07:12,391 --> 00:07:15,644
I'm not saying that.
It's just that he can't stay here.

114
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:21,525
- Hello, Niles. Come in.
- I hope you don't mind my stopping by.

115
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:25,112
Maris is hosting the Women's
League Senior Yoga Group.

116
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:28,657
And, well,
old money and body stockings...

117
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:35,581
Say no more.
You're welcome to hide out here.

118
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:40,252
- I see the kennel is still open.
- Yes, but that's the last one.

119
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:45,382
I'd found a home for him, but Daphne
thought the family wasn't nice enough.

120
00:07:45,549 --> 00:07:49,261
- Some pâté, Niles?
- I didn't reject them. The dog did.

121
00:07:49,428 --> 00:07:53,098
Canines have a very
keen sense of who's a nice person.

122
00:07:53,265 --> 00:07:56,602
Many's the time
I've chosen a man based solely

123
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:59,146
on the way
my mum's spaniel took to him.

124
00:07:59,313 --> 00:08:03,400
Daphne, that is preposterous,
letting a dog choose your dates.

125
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:06,445
It's true. If a dog likes a man,

126
00:08:06,612 --> 00:08:09,740
it's a good bet
he's warm and sensitive.

127
00:08:09,907 --> 00:08:13,660
I didn't get
a good look at this little tike.

128
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:20,375
Come here, boy.
Come to your Uncle Niles. Oh! Oh!

129
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:28,509
He's taken quite a shine to you.

130
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:30,802
Yes. Happens all the time.

131
00:08:33,222 --> 00:08:35,891
Daphne, would you take the dog away?

132
00:08:36,058 --> 00:08:39,394
Phone the Thomasons
and tell them we've reconsidered.

133
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:42,272
All right,
but only for a two-week trial.

134
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:44,650
- Thank you.
- Come along, Basil.

135
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:46,985
I told you not to name them!

136
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:52,032
- Hello, Dad.
- Afternoon, boys.

137
00:08:57,663 --> 00:09:00,249
Dad, I seem to remember that Eddie

138
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:03,585
had a little appointment
down at the vet's.

139
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:08,507
I can't help but notice
he still has that...spring in his step.

140
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:17,015
We started heading down there,
but the traffic was a bear.

141
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:21,186
You get a sunny day
and everybody forgets how to drive.

142
00:09:23,856 --> 00:09:25,899
You are going to reschedule?

143
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:28,527
(Martin)
Oh, yeah. I'll call in the morning.

144
00:09:28,694 --> 00:09:32,614
This is the second time
you've cancelled. What's the problem?

145
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:35,450
'There's no problem.
What's the big deal?

146
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:37,744
'I'll call tomorrow. Relax, will you?'

147
00:09:39,288 --> 00:09:42,040
- Dear God, he's licking me!
- Eddie!

148
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:44,376
Eddie, just stop.

149
00:09:45,878 --> 00:09:47,504
Niles...

150
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:51,175
You have liver behind your ears.

151
00:09:52,551 --> 00:09:55,637
I imagine I must have picked up
a cracker

152
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:58,098
and inadvertently
scratched behind my ear.

153
00:09:58,265 --> 00:10:01,810
You had a wad of cold meat
behind your ears

154
00:10:01,977 --> 00:10:04,646
and you didn't feel it?

155
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:07,441
That's the story
I'm sticking with, yes.

156
00:10:10,986 --> 00:10:14,072
I want an assurance
you'll take care of it.

157
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:18,744
- You promise?
- I said I'd do it and I will!

158
00:10:18,911 --> 00:10:22,289
Get off my back!
I'll be down at Duke's.

159
00:10:23,415 --> 00:10:26,919
Ever notice how much faster
he moves when he's wrong?

160
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:30,339
He's got a psychological block
against taking Eddie there.

161
00:10:30,506 --> 00:10:34,676
I'll have to do it. Somebody has
to be responsible. Good boy.

162
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:36,970
Come on. Let's go. Eddie?

163
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:40,516
Uh, Niles.

164
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,811
Oh. Now, Eddie,
it's a routine operation.

165
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:49,399
They say it's almost painless,
although I can't imagine...

166
00:10:52,611 --> 00:10:56,615
No, Niles. Perhaps it's best
we don't discuss the operation.

167
00:10:56,782 --> 00:10:58,825
We might spook him.

168
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:02,329
Excuse me?
Are you saying he understands me?

169
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:07,334
Well, he understands
the word B-A-T-H.

170
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:10,087
God knows how much English
he's picked up.

171
00:11:10,254 --> 00:11:12,089
Fine.

172
00:11:12,256 --> 00:11:15,342
(Speaking French)

173
00:11:23,225 --> 00:11:25,727
What are we doing?
Eddie, come here!

174
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:28,480
This is ridiculous. Look at him!

175
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,252
What are you staring at?

176
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:55,048
You know why you're here,
don't you?

177
00:11:56,133 --> 00:12:00,554
Listen, it's for your own good.
You'll be much happier afterwards.

178
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:09,605
Look, your day-to-day routine,
it'll be exactly the same.

179
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:13,233
You'll be able to sleep,
run around with your little buddies,

180
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,695
go play in the woods,
chase the birds, lick your...

181
00:12:21,325 --> 00:12:23,368
Did I mention sleep?

182
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:28,332
You got a lot of nerve!
You all right, boy?

183
00:12:28,499 --> 00:12:30,626
Why are you so upset?

184
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:33,879
- I'm helping you out.
- That's a load of crap!

185
00:12:34,046 --> 00:12:38,091
We agreed on this.
You had a problem so l took charge.

186
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:41,803
I don't need you taking charge.
Mind your own business.

187
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:45,224
I don't need your help
and l don't want it!

188
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,518
It doesn't matter who brought him here.

189
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:52,064
I can do it, I feed him,
walk him and give him his bath.

190
00:12:52,231 --> 00:12:54,191
- Eddie!
- No!

191
00:12:54,358 --> 00:12:56,818
- See what you did?
- Me?

192
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:02,741
OK, thanks. Listen, Daphne's
here in case anybody sees him.

193
00:13:04,326 --> 00:13:07,412
I got the guys at the station
circulating Eddie's picture.

194
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:11,750
- I'll look for him some more.
- You've done enough.

195
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:14,253
- Sit still and drink your tea.
- I hate tea.

196
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:17,297
In an emergency,
it's all I know how to do.

197
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:20,968
That's a real comfort,
coming from a health-care provider.

198
00:13:29,059 --> 00:13:32,563
Dad, I'm sorry.
There was no luck at the pound.

199
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:37,943
They'll call if they find a dog
matching Eddie's description.

200
00:13:39,069 --> 00:13:41,822
A $500 reward for Eddie?

201
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:46,827
Are you sure it's enough?

202
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:52,708
It's about 500 more
than l'd pay to get you back.

203
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:56,879
Dad, I said I was sorry.

204
00:13:57,045 --> 00:14:00,507
I can't sit here.
I'm going back to the park.

205
00:14:00,674 --> 00:14:03,302
What makes you think
he'll show up there?

206
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:07,681
That's his hangout. Didn't you have
a place where you met women,

207
00:14:07,848 --> 00:14:09,933
a place where you got lucky?

208
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:15,480
- Well, I suppose so.
- Didn't you go back?

209
00:14:16,565 --> 00:14:18,609
To the park!

210
00:14:19,443 --> 00:14:23,363
This time we'll comb every inch
of it, every tree, every bush.

211
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:27,993
- Daphne, we'll need help.
- Call Niles. Tell him we'll pick him up.

212
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:32,164
Why go into the wild without
one of the great outdoors men?

213
00:14:32,331 --> 00:14:34,833
Oh, this is odd.

214
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,045
l just got a psychic flash about Eddie.

215
00:14:38,212 --> 00:14:41,131
- Well?
- It doesn't make any sense.

216
00:14:41,298 --> 00:14:46,094
All I'm getting is a picture of Eddie
sitting with Dr Crane.

217
00:14:46,261 --> 00:14:50,724
Dr Frasier Crane...
he listens

218
00:14:55,354 --> 00:14:58,273
- Any luck?
- I couldn't find him.

219
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:02,569
- Where's Niles?
- We split up to cover more ground.

220
00:15:03,654 --> 00:15:08,242
Scrunch down. If Eddie sees
you here, he'll run away again.

221
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:21,588
Let's call it a night.
You've been here three hours.

222
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:26,009
I was on a stakeout for 1 5 hours
without getting out of the car.

223
00:15:26,176 --> 00:15:29,263
We had a contest to see
who'd last longest.

224
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:33,308
The winner was Canteen McHugh.
Know why we called him that?

225
00:15:33,475 --> 00:15:35,602
I think I can guess.

226
00:15:37,229 --> 00:15:39,398
His bladder was the size of a canteen.

227
00:15:39,565 --> 00:15:41,567
Thank you for clearing that up.

228
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:43,777
You could have slung it
on your shoulder

229
00:15:43,944 --> 00:15:46,738
and done a 20-mile march
through the desert.

230
00:15:46,905 --> 00:15:49,658
- Big, huh?
- That's what I've been saying.

231
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,747
Close that window! It's freezing!

232
00:15:55,914 --> 00:16:00,002
- It's like a blast furnace.
- At my age, you get cold easily.

233
00:16:00,169 --> 00:16:01,587
Right.

234
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:09,595
Dad, I've just developed
a very interesting theory about you.

235
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:14,266
lf I begged you,
would you share it with me?

236
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:19,688
If that's your attitude, just forget it.

237
00:16:20,606 --> 00:16:22,691
(Car phone rings)

238
00:16:24,943 --> 00:16:26,987
Hello? Oh, Niles.

239
00:16:27,154 --> 00:16:29,781
- Did he find him?
- Just a second.

240
00:16:29,948 --> 00:16:32,743
Let me put you on speakerphone.
Hang on.

241
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:38,040
- OK. Go ahead, Niles.
- (Niles) 'I'm in the park and l'm lost.

242
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:46,173
- 'Thank God for my cellular.'
- Did you see Eddie?

243
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:49,176
'No, but I thought I saw a raccoon.

244
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:53,805
'When I stopped running,
I had no idea where I was.

245
00:16:54,014 --> 00:16:57,976
- 'You've got to help me.'
- Niles, just remain calm.

246
00:16:58,143 --> 00:17:01,230
Let me think back
to my Boy Scout training.

247
00:17:01,396 --> 00:17:06,568
Now, we're on the northeast
corner of the park.

248
00:17:06,735 --> 00:17:08,862
All right, look into the heavens

249
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:12,157
and see if you can spot the North Star.

250
00:17:12,324 --> 00:17:14,535
Then you turn 12 degrees...

251
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:17,496
For God's sake!
Walk towards the horn.

252
00:17:17,663 --> 00:17:20,415
(Car horn beeps)

253
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,632
'I hear it, Dad. I'm walking.'

254
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:31,218
All right. Just keep following it.

255
00:17:33,011 --> 00:17:35,889
'I see a grove of trees and a fountain

256
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:40,018
'and a horrible hunchbacked
old man. Stay away from me!

257
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,023
'No. It was just a bush.

258
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:51,029
'Things are beginning
to look familiar. Keep honking.

259
00:17:51,196 --> 00:17:53,282
(Car horn beeps)

260
00:17:53,532 --> 00:17:57,536
'I think I'm homing in.
I'm quite sure this is the way.'

261
00:18:00,622 --> 00:18:02,708
OK, you can hang up now.

262
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:06,879
That was a harrowing experience.

263
00:18:07,045 --> 00:18:11,258
A shrub and a raccoon
and you live to tell about it.

264
00:18:11,425 --> 00:18:16,471
Dad, I'm sorry I couldn't find Eddie.
I hope you understand.

265
00:18:16,638 --> 00:18:20,350
I think I'd like to go home now
and hold my wife.

266
00:18:20,517 --> 00:18:24,396
That is, if she'll let me.
I'll just hail a cab.

267
00:18:24,563 --> 00:18:28,108
Call us from the curb
so we know you're safe.

268
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:39,912
You're probably tired.
If you want to go, it's OK.

269
00:18:40,078 --> 00:18:43,707
That's all right, Dad.
I'll stay for a while longer.

270
00:18:49,838 --> 00:18:53,258
I'm sorry I cut you off like that before.

271
00:18:53,425 --> 00:18:57,095
I've just never gone in
for psychological mumbo jumbo.

272
00:18:57,262 --> 00:19:00,974
Probably started on the force
when we had to see ''The Squirrel''.

273
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:02,559
Who?

274
00:19:02,726 --> 00:19:06,188
Dr Bergman. The department shrink.
It was his nickname.

275
00:19:06,355 --> 00:19:09,358
Guys got sent to him
when they got squirrelly.

276
00:19:09,525 --> 00:19:13,237
He'd show you ink blots
and ask about your toilet habits.

277
00:19:13,403 --> 00:19:16,615
I could talk about that
with Nat Dembrowski.

278
00:19:16,782 --> 00:19:19,993
- We nicknamed him the Big...
- Thank you.

279
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:29,670
Look, it wasn't just Eddie
I was mad about.

280
00:19:29,837 --> 00:19:33,215
Eddie was the straw
that broke the camel's back.

281
00:19:33,382 --> 00:19:37,386
I'm always being told
to take my feet off the furniture,

282
00:19:37,553 --> 00:19:41,306
put a coaster under my beer,
turn the TV down.

283
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:47,062
I used to make the rules
and now l follow them.

284
00:19:47,229 --> 00:19:49,314
Does this make any sense to you?

285
00:19:49,481 --> 00:19:52,526
Psychologically,
it makes perfect sense.

286
00:19:52,693 --> 00:19:56,363
Slowly your responsibilities
have been taken away from you

287
00:19:56,530 --> 00:20:01,535
and you... Well, you
feel...symbolically castrated.

288
00:20:01,702 --> 00:20:05,998
Why does everything with
you shrinks start in the crotch?

289
00:20:06,582 --> 00:20:08,834
All right, all right.

290
00:20:09,001 --> 00:20:12,421
Well, maybe my rules are too rigid.

291
00:20:12,588 --> 00:20:14,631
Maybe I should relax a little.

292
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:18,927
No, no. Hey, it's your house.
You do what you want.

293
00:20:20,012 --> 00:20:22,264
I don't know what's bugging me.

294
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:29,146
I guess it's not easy for a guy
like me to not be in charge.

295
00:20:31,732 --> 00:20:36,236
People confuse not being in charge
with not being respected.

296
00:20:37,613 --> 00:20:40,991
I...hope you're not making that mistake.

297
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:45,704
Cos you command
a great deal of respect.

298
00:20:45,871 --> 00:20:50,918
Every day I hold myself up
to the Martin Crane yardstick.

299
00:20:52,002 --> 00:20:56,715
I guess a son always
wants to make his father proud.

300
00:20:58,717 --> 00:21:01,011
Yeah, I guess.

301
00:21:02,804 --> 00:21:04,598
So?

302
00:21:06,391 --> 00:21:08,644
Yeah, yeah, you're doing fine.

303
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:12,064
Even if you are a big pain in the ass.

304
00:21:15,609 --> 00:21:19,905
I don't know if I could have
made Eddie have that operation.

305
00:21:20,072 --> 00:21:24,243
That's a tough thing for a guy
to do to another guy.

306
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:27,246
Amen to that.

307
00:21:35,212 --> 00:21:37,506
You know, it's getting late.

308
00:21:37,673 --> 00:21:40,384
What do you say
we get some sleep?

309
00:21:42,177 --> 00:21:45,097
Eddie! Come here, boy!

310
00:21:47,099 --> 00:21:49,726
Hey, attaboy! Hey-hey!

311
00:21:49,893 --> 00:21:53,230
Good to see you, fella.
How are you doing?

312
00:21:53,397 --> 00:21:58,819
- Welcome him back.
- Hello, Eddie. Good dog. Oh, wet dog!

313
00:21:58,986 --> 00:22:02,990
You're shivering. Here.
We got to get you warmed up.

314
00:22:03,156 --> 00:22:05,492
Dad,
that's a 100% cashmere pullover!

315
00:22:05,617 --> 00:22:08,245
It's meant to be worn
with the collar up.

316
00:22:13,584 --> 00:22:19,298
# Hey baby, I hear the blues are calling
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

317
00:22:19,464 --> 00:22:20,507
# Mercy!

318
00:22:20,674 --> 00:22:27,764
# And maybe I seem a bit confused
Well, maybe, but I got you pegged

319
00:22:27,931 --> 00:22:33,604
# But I don't know what to do with those
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

320
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:36,565
# They're calling again #

321
00:22:36,732 --> 00:22:38,775
Thank you.
