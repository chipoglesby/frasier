I took advantage of her.

158
00:08:37,687 --> 00:08:39,757
I mean,
that's why she ran out of here.

159
00:08:39,927 --> 00:08:42,395
- Do you think I did?
- Fras, you're both adults.

160
00:08:42,567 --> 00:08:45,206
- Where's the harm?
- Well, you can't be serious, Dad.

161
00:08:45,367 --> 00:08:47,278
I mean,
do you realise what this means?

162
00:08:47,447 --> 00:08:49,324
I have probably
destroyed our friendship.

163
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:51,637
Do you know what she'll see
every time she looks at me?

164
00:08:51,807 --> 00:08:54,367
- Your naked body.
- Oh, dear God.

165
00:08:55,527 --> 00:08:57,563
I was gonna say
somebody who has betrayed her trust,

166
00:08:57,727 --> 00:08:59,638
but, oh, dear God.

167
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:03,165
Frasier, don't get all worked up. When
are you supposed to see her next?

168
00:09:03,647 --> 00:09:06,480
- Uh, we're meeting for dinner tonight.
- So everything's normal.

169
00:09:06,647 --> 00:09:08,797
You're gonna feel weird and stupid
for a while,

170
00:09:08,967 --> 00:09:11,083
and then you'll have a big laugh
about it and move on.

171
00:09:12,167 --> 00:09:15,239
Yeah, you're probably right, huh?
I mean, we're... We're adults.

172
00:09:15,407 --> 00:09:17,796
We can discuss this.
We're gonna be fine.

173
00:09:17,967 --> 00:09:19,446
Well, we better be.

174
00:09:19,607 --> 00:09:21,279
I told her I'd go to Wisconsin
with her.

175
00:09:21,447 --> 00:09:24,200
Wow, you really were lonely.

176
00:09:26,207 --> 00:09:28,641
I want to go on this trip
as much as you do.

177
00:09:28,807 --> 00:09:30,923
But we can't leave Mom alone
for a week right now.

178
00:09:31,087 --> 00:09:32,076
She seems unbalanced.

179
00:09:32,247 --> 00:09:35,000
Well... Well, maybe she could
stay here with Frasier and Dad.

180
00:09:35,167 --> 00:09:36,156
Oh, oh!

What are we talking about?

182
00:09:37,847 --> 00:09:38,836
It's Mom again.

183
00:09:39,007 --> 00:09:41,726
She's been crying non-stop
since we left here last night.

184
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:44,959
Sounds like a job
for the prescription pad, Niles.

185
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:48,725
I can't even get Dad on the phone.

186
00:09:48,887 --> 00:09:50,479
He doesn't even know I'm engaged.

187
00:09:50,647 --> 00:09:53,639
I guess I can forget about him
walking me down the aisle.

Yeah, hang... Hang on one second.

Daphne, I have the solution.

193

I want you to use those tickets
and take your mother to Hawaii.

194
00:10:07,647 --> 00:10:08,716
Are you out of your mind?

195
00:10:08,887 --> 00:10:11,037
No, no, we are gonna have
a lifetime of romantic trips.

196
00:10:11,207 --> 00:10:13,084
Now what's important
is taking care of your mom.

197
00:10:13,247 --> 00:10:15,761
- Like you said, she's fragile.
- Niles, that's very thoughtful,

198
00:10:15,927 --> 00:10:17,679
but I don't want to go to Hawaii
with my mom.

199

- Dad, I have a plan.
- Niles, you're a sucker.

You know Mrs. Moon's
so-called knee injury?

204
00:10:30,487 --> 00:10:33,126
Well, last night I noticed her
limping on the wrong leg.

205
00:10:33,287 --> 00:10:35,357
I know. She switches.

So how's Roz?

00:10:40,927 --> 00:10:44,602
- She's fleeing the city, thank you.
- Oh, come on.

208
00:10:44,767 --> 00:10:46,962
She's going to Wisconsin
without me.

She's leaving immediately.
I told you this was gonna happen.

- Our friendship is in ruins.
- Yeah.

What do you mean, "yeah"?

Well, I kind of thought
that might happen.

213
00:10:56,847 --> 00:10:58,519
I was just trying
to make you feel better.

214

Now, remember,
when you arrive, a car will be waiting

to take you to
the Nani Emaka Hehila Ai House.

I don't know why we can't go
somewhere where they speak English.

They do speak English in Hawaii,
Mom.

00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:21,243
How come you can fly to Hawaii,
but you can't fly to England?

219
00:11:21,407 --> 00:11:25,559
How come you can drive your car,
but you can't do your own laundry?

Have a good trip.

Same reason I didn't tell him

I do, Dad?

- Well, obviously, we did,

but you can't blame us.

Well, honey, it looks like you owe Roz
an apology.

DENISE: Oh, no, she knows
I was just teasing her.

I'm just relieved
that she's finally found someone.

We just want her to have
the kind of happiness that we found.

Well, you know,

And I intend to prove it to her.

- Oh, Roger, can Craig fix you a drink?

289
00:14:46,127 --> 00:14:48,687

Well, well, well.

Looks like you've really made
an impression on Roger here, Roz.

293
00:14:56,567 --> 00:14:58,444
ROZ: Yeah.
- How did you two meet again?

Gosh, well, it's... It's the cutest story.
Here, come on, honey, sit down. Uh...

295
00:15:02,887 --> 00:15:08,041
Uh, actually, um, it all started
when Alice used to wave at me

296

when I was driving
my trash-collecting truck.

Well, I guess Alice is sure
gonna be happy to see you again.

Oh, well, you know, it's funny.
As well as, uh, Alice and I get along,

300
00:15:21,967 --> 00:15:25,323
she always mistakes me
for Roz's boss.

301

- It's weird, isn't it?
- Oh, yeah.

- Here we are.
- Oh, uh, thank you.

So, Roger, I hear you're a big golfer.

What do you shoot?

00:15:32,847 --> 00:15:37,159
Well, you know, actually, since I met
Roz, um, I don't get much time for golf.

306
00:15:37,327 --> 00:15:39,397
Well, don't get too used to that, Roz.

307
00:15:39,567 --> 00:15:42,365
I've been a golf widow
ever since I've been married.

308
00:15:42,527 --> 00:15:44,677
It's like a disease with them.

309
00:15:44,847 --> 00:15:47,315
Well, maybe with, uh, most men,
but not with me.

310
00:15:47,487 --> 00:15:49,045
I mean, my spare time is precious

311
00:15:49,207 --> 00:15:51,880
so I like to spend it
with the people that I love.

312
00:15:52,047 --> 00:15:58,043
Like Roz and Alice, and, who knows,
maybe someday some more little ones.

00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:04,166
Oh, my God, I hated that picture.

316
00:16:04,327 --> 00:16:09,401
Big ugly glasses and I guess
I was trying to look like Dorothy Hamill.

but you insisted.

You know, if I'd met this girl
in the fifth grade,

319
00:16:15,727 --> 00:16:17,877
I wouldn't have dated anybody else.

for my desk at work?

- Dashboard. Heh, heh. You know.

322
00:16:26,447 --> 00:16:29,564
Yeah, I looked
in the "getting started" section.

323
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:31,879
Yeah, I did that.

to do some tricks.

Can't you make these things easier?

So this one's getting tired,
she wants to head back up the beach,

00:16:59,767 --> 00:17:04,636
when finally she sees the blanket
surrounded by candles,

and the food and the wine
that I'd set up.

once in a while?

Why can't you be more like her
and not be such a nag?

That was the best half-hour
I have ever spent with my family.

Thank you.
But what are you doing here?

347
00:17:40,887 --> 00:17:42,718
I just had to make sure
we were okay.

348
00:17:42,887 --> 00:17:46,038
- I told you we were okay.
- Yeah, I know. Then you ran away.

349
00:17:46,207 --> 00:17:48,038
I know. I should have stayed
and talked to you.

350

It's just, usually when I'm freaked out
I turn to you.

For that. For that evening. That...

You were vulnerable
and I feel like I took advantage of you.

Oh, Frasier, I'm a grownup.

I was just worried that...

359
00:18:09,767 --> 00:18:13,965
Well, over the years we've almost
gone to bed a couple of times,

360
00:18:14,127 --> 00:18:17,915
and we haven't because we were
afraid it would damage our friendship.

- Now we've done it.
- Right.

362
00:18:21,327 --> 00:18:25,843
I was just worried that things
have changed between us.

363
00:18:26,007 --> 00:18:28,282
That's what I came here to ask you.

364
00:18:35,367 --> 00:18:39,883
I remember the last time I sat here,
just like this.

365
00:18:40,047 --> 00:18:42,925
My old high-school boyfriend
sat right where you are

366
00:18:43,087 --> 00:18:46,363
and he told me he'd been accepted
into college in Boston.

00:18:46,527 --> 00:18:47,562
Hmm.

368
00:18:47,727 --> 00:18:50,958
And I just stared at his shoelaces.

369
00:18:51,127 --> 00:18:54,437
I was afraid I'd cry
if I looked anywhere else, you know.

00:18:54,607 --> 00:19:00,318
Anyway, we promised
that we would always be friends.

371
00:19:00,487 --> 00:19:02,239
And it was just the saddest thing
in the world

372
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:04,363
because I knew it wasn't true.

And this time?

374
00:19:09,367 --> 00:19:12,165
We will always be friends, Frasier.

Nothing's gonna ever change that.
