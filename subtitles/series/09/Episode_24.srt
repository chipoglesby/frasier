Welcome back, Seattle.

00:00:09,847 --> 00:00:11,678
Thank you for joining us
in celebrating this,

3
00:00:11,847 --> 00:00:14,156
our 2000th show.

4
00:00:14,327 --> 00:00:17,080
- Hard to believe, isn't it, Roz?
- No, that feels just about right.

5
00:00:17,247 --> 00:00:20,557
Ah, yes, well,
what a festive day this is.

6
00:00:20,727 --> 00:00:23,002
No stop has been unpulled.

7
00:00:23,167 --> 00:00:24,805
I would like to take this opportunity

8
00:00:24,967 --> 00:00:27,276
to acknowledge
the anniversary luncheon spread

9
00:00:27,447 --> 00:00:30,598
provided by our friends
at Señor José Phong,

10
00:00:30,887 --> 00:00:32,798
home of the sweet and sour taco.

11
00:00:32,967 --> 00:00:34,480
And don't forget, a little later,

12
00:00:34,647 --> 00:00:38,925
we'll have Microsoft Chairman
Bill Gates live in studio

13
00:00:39,087 --> 00:00:41,442
to congratulate me on
my 2000th show.

14
00:00:41,607 --> 00:00:43,518
Apparently, I hear through
the grapevine,

15
00:00:43,687 --> 00:00:45,837
he is a big fan.

It's time for another blooper.

19
00:00:50,727 --> 00:00:54,037

to number four

as voted by you, the listeners.

21
00:00:57,607 --> 00:01:00,838
Here's what happened
when a certain producer

22
00:01:01,007 --> 00:01:05,285
didn't realise her microphone
was on during the show.

that wasn't voted number one.

Oh, ha, ladies and gentlemen,
it's our station manager,

KACL's own Kenny Daly. Ha, ha.

32
00:01:28,327 --> 00:01:31,160
Listen, doc, I got a special someone
out there who'd like to say hello.

33
00:01:31,327 --> 00:01:33,602
By all means,
let's bring him in, Kenny.

our special guest has finally arrived.

Well, ladies and gentlemen,

40
00:01:45,567 --> 00:01:48,286
it's our old friend and former colleague,
Bob "Bulldog" Briscoe.

Thanks for coming
to celebrate my 2000th show.

Bulldog's been gone too long.

How can you get me back on the air?
Okay, listen up.

Would you and your noisemaker
please wait in Roz's booth?

- This is an air horn, doc.

Ha, ha. Good to see you, sir.

55
00:02:22,727 --> 00:02:24,445
- Sorry I was late.
- Oh, that's all right.

56
00:02:24,607 --> 00:02:27,440
- I was just talking to an old friend.
- Yes, ha, ha.

57
00:02:31,327 --> 00:02:34,205
Well, I've... I've got
so many questions to ask you.

Uh, why don't we just dive right in?

59
00:02:37,087 --> 00:02:38,566
I've been wondering,

60
00:02:38,727 --> 00:02:42,276
when did you first
become a fan of my show?

61
00:02:42,447 --> 00:02:45,200
Excuse me.
Warren from Kirkland is on Line 2.

62
00:02:45,367 --> 00:02:48,882
Ye... Yes, Roz. I won't be taking
any calls until after Mr. Gates has left.

63
00:02:49,287 --> 00:02:52,279
- Actually, it's for Mr. Gates.

Go ahead, caller.
You're on with Mister Bill Gates.

WARREN [ON PHONE]:
<i>Yeah, hi, Mr. Gates.</i>

66
00:02:57,407 --> 00:02:59,079
<i>I bought your new</i>
<i>Windows XP programme,</i>

67

<i>but it's an upgrade.</i>

68
00:03:01,687 --> 00:03:04,645
- <i>Do I need to make a boot disc?</i>
- That's a very good question.

69
00:03:04,807 --> 00:03:06,798
You don't need to make a boot disk.

70
00:03:06,967 --> 00:03:08,639
You just put the CD in,
and it'll upgrade.

71
00:03:08,807 --> 00:03:10,160
I hope that answers your question.

72
00:03:10,327 --> 00:03:13,239
That's a feature of XP,
very quick, very smooth.

Thank you for calling, Warren.

75
00:03:18,567 --> 00:03:19,682
Now, where were we?

76
00:03:19,847 --> 00:03:23,760
Can Mr. Gates take a few more calls?
The board is lighting up. Wow.

Who knew we had a Line 7?

78
00:03:26,447 --> 00:03:28,324
Uh, Roz, I believe Mr. Gates
is probably anxious

79
00:03:28,487 --> 00:03:31,559
- to get on with the interview.
- No, no, I'm... I'm happy to.

Well, the Multilingual add-ons

I just listened for five minutes

in case he asked me
what my favourite part was.

This is a collection of all my shows.

I was just examining my collection
when I realised that someone...

118

But I guarantee you, I would never
have removed my tape from the case

and replaced it with

And it definitely rules out Niles.

- Dr. Crane...
- Or does it?

137
00:07:00,287 --> 00:07:01,879
Perhaps the tape
was just a red herring,

138
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:03,958
meant to throw me off the scent.

There's only one of you
that would combat me on that level.

141
00:07:08,807 --> 00:07:11,116
- I did it!
- Ah-ha!

142
00:07:11,287 --> 00:07:14,279
You can't say, "ah-ha."
You thought it was me.

143
00:07:14,447 --> 00:07:17,245
- Why'd you do it, Daphne?
- I didn't mean to.

144
00:07:17,407 --> 00:07:20,877
I was trying to listen to a tape in that
boom box you gave me for Christmas,

145
00:07:21,047 --> 00:07:22,605
only I wasn't getting any sound,

146
00:07:22,767 --> 00:07:24,997
and I didn't know if it were the tape
or the boom box,

147
00:07:25,167 --> 00:07:26,600
and I didn't have any other tapes,

148
00:07:26,767 --> 00:07:29,235
so I grabbed one of your tapes
just to test the boom box out.

149
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:32,205
And it turns out
it was the boom box after all.

150
00:07:32,367 --> 00:07:34,517
Only then,
I couldn't get it out of the boom box,

151
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:39,238
so I used a screwdriver to pry it out,
and I broke the tape. I'm so sorry.

152

- Stand down, Niles.

Do you realise what you've done?

155
00:07:52,327 --> 00:07:54,318
This isn't like any normal tape

156
00:07:54,487 --> 00:08:00,164
that you can just go down to
your local music shop and purchase.

157
00:08:00,327 --> 00:08:04,240
It's unique and irreplaceable.

158
00:08:04,407 --> 00:08:06,637
Can't you just get the station
to make you a copy?

159
00:08:06,807 --> 00:08:10,766
Unless I get the station
to make me another copy,

160
00:08:10,927 --> 00:08:12,963
which, or course, I can.

161
00:08:13,127 --> 00:08:15,561
The only transgression here

162
00:08:15,727 --> 00:08:18,764
is that Daphne didn't come to me
with the truth.

163
00:08:18,927 --> 00:08:21,441
Oh, I'm so sorry, Dr. Crane.

164
00:08:21,607 --> 00:08:23,882
I will never lie to you again.

165
00:08:24,047 --> 00:08:26,925
Well, then, if that's
what you learned, it was all worth it.

166
00:08:27,087 --> 00:08:28,839
So, what are we all sitting here for?

167
00:08:29,007 --> 00:08:31,726
I believe we have
a 2000th show to celebrate.

168
00:08:31,887 --> 00:08:33,639
NILES: Here, here.
- So, did you all listen?

169
00:08:33,807 --> 00:08:35,365
NILES: Oh, did we.
MARTIN: It was great.

170
00:08:35,527 --> 00:08:37,643
DAPHNE: I especially liked
that call from Tacoma.

171
00:08:37,807 --> 00:08:39,877
Oh, which one?

172
00:08:41,967 --> 00:08:42,956
You know, in nine years,

173
00:08:43,127 --> 00:08:45,197
this is the first time
I've been down to the archives.

174
00:08:45,367 --> 00:08:47,961
- Oh, my God. I remember this place.
- Really?

175
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:51,358
I came down here once
after a Christmas party.

176
00:08:51,527 --> 00:08:53,404
Whatever for?

177
00:08:53,567 --> 00:08:55,762
Well, I had
a little too much champagne,

178
00:08:55,927 --> 00:08:59,602
and you know how you get
a little lonely around the holiday?

179
00:08:59,767 --> 00:09:01,962
Brings back memories, huh, Roz?

180
00:09:02,407 --> 00:09:04,443
- Bulldog!
- That was some Christmas, huh?

181
00:09:04,727 --> 00:09:06,718
When Santa left
a bit of Bulldog in your stockings.

182
00:09:06,887 --> 00:09:08,240
[LAUGHS]

183
00:09:08,407 --> 00:09:09,999
You're disgusting.

184
00:09:10,167 --> 00:09:12,806
What, I went too far? I'm sorry.
Why don't, uh, you come back here?

185
00:09:12,967 --> 00:09:14,685
I'll slip you an apology.

186
00:09:15,087 --> 00:09:17,317
Bulldog's still got it!

187
00:09:17,727 --> 00:09:19,399
Bulldog, what the hell
are you doing here?

188
00:09:19,567 --> 00:09:21,444
Oh, this is, uh, this is my new job.

189
00:09:21,607 --> 00:09:23,404
I, uh, catalogue the archive.

190
00:09:23,567 --> 00:09:25,080
You know, I clean up a bit,

191
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:27,636
but, uh, I figure
I'll be back on the air in no time,

192
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:30,879
as long as I attack this job
with my trademark "can-do" attitude.

193
00:09:31,047 --> 00:09:35,120
Great. Well, then, we're looking for
a copy of my show, episode 893.

194
00:09:35,287 --> 00:09:37,198
- No can do.
- What?

195
00:09:37,367 --> 00:09:40,484
What, I only been here an hour.
I don't even know where the john is.

196
00:09:40,647 --> 00:09:42,160
Where...?

197
00:09:42,327 --> 00:09:44,158
Where's my PowerBar?

198
00:09:44,847 --> 00:09:46,599
I had a PowerBar here.

199
00:09:46,767 --> 00:09:49,235
Someone stole my PowerBar!
This stinks!

200
00:09:49,407 --> 00:09:52,956
This is total B. S!
This is... Oh, here it is.

201
00:09:56,047 --> 00:09:57,799
Frasier, here's a box marked
"Best of Crane."

202
00:09:57,967 --> 00:10:00,276
Oh, uh, thanks, Roz.
Let's have a look. Ah, good.

203
00:10:00,447 --> 00:10:01,516
What...?

204
00:10:04,167 --> 00:10:05,805
There's just a few tapes in here.

205
00:10:05,967 --> 00:10:09,164
- All right, keep looking.
- Oh, hey, doc.

206
00:10:09,327 --> 00:10:10,760
Kenny, just the man
I was looking for.

207
00:10:10,927 --> 00:10:14,602
Listen, where are all the tapes
of my shows kept?

208
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:17,237
You got them, right there.

209
00:10:17,407 --> 00:10:19,159
- Well, where are the rest of them?
- Yes.

210
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:21,761
There are no rest.
We record over them.

211
00:10:21,927 --> 00:10:23,997
I mean, look around, doc,
we got a space problem here.

212
00:10:24,167 --> 00:10:26,442
Hey, Kenny, where do you want me
to put these snow tyres?

213
00:10:26,607 --> 00:10:28,802
Oh, put them
right next to my kids' bikes.

214
00:10:35,447 --> 00:10:36,960
FRASIER:
Good afternoon, Seattle.

215
00:10:37,127 --> 00:10:42,076
Before we go to the phones,
I have a boon to ask of you.

216
00:10:42,247 --> 00:10:45,239
If any of you happens to have
in your possession

217
00:10:45,407 --> 00:10:47,318
a tape of my broadcast

218
00:10:47,487 --> 00:10:52,561
from June 14, 1996,

219
00:10:53,127 --> 00:10:55,482
I am in need of a copy.

220
00:10:55,647 --> 00:10:57,603
You see, I understand that
from time to time

221
00:10:57,767 --> 00:11:00,201
people who call in to my show
record it,

222
00:11:00,367 --> 00:11:02,562
perhaps in order to...
To review my advice,

223
00:11:02,727 --> 00:11:05,195
or even just play it for some friends.

224
00:11:06,127 --> 00:11:08,800
Now, I realise that
this is a bit of a long shot,

225
00:11:08,967 --> 00:11:12,960
but it is the only missing tape
of my collection,

226
00:11:13,127 --> 00:11:17,006
and therefore, of course,
has great sentimental value.

227
00:11:17,167 --> 00:11:19,920
Thanks for your consideration.
Now, Roz, who's our first caller?

228
00:11:20,087 --> 00:11:23,159
We have Joe from Vashon Island
on Line 1.

229
00:11:23,327 --> 00:11:25,887
Go ahead, Joe, I'm listening.

230
00:11:26,047 --> 00:11:27,605
JOE [ON PHONE]:
<i>About that missing tape.</i>

231
00:11:27,767 --> 00:11:29,041
- Yes, yes?
JOE [ON PHONE]: <i>Yeah,</i>

232
00:11:29,207 --> 00:11:30,481
<i>I know what you're going through.</i>

233
00:11:30,647 --> 00:11:33,445
<i>A couple years ago, I was in</i>
<i>a taxicab and lost a gold cufflink.</i>

234
00:11:33,607 --> 00:11:36,075
Yes, and this relates
to my missing tape how?

235
00:11:36,247 --> 00:11:38,886
JOE [ON PHONE]:
<i>Well, it's missing, and I'm bummed.</i>

236
00:11:39,047 --> 00:11:41,242
<i>It has the initials J.S. On it.</i>

237
00:11:41,407 --> 00:11:43,762
<i>If anyone finds it,</i>
<i>I'd love to have it back.</i>

238
00:11:43,927 --> 00:11:47,237
Yes, um, I'm sure you would,
but unless it's about my missing tape,

239
00:11:47,407 --> 00:11:49,079
well, then I would prefer
to stick to calls

240
00:11:49,247 --> 00:11:53,479
about mental and emotional issues,
as usual.

241
00:11:53,647 --> 00:11:55,922
Thank you for your call.

242
00:11:56,087 --> 00:11:57,520
Who's our next caller, Roz?

243
00:11:57,687 --> 00:11:59,166
We have Phyllis from Green Lake.

244
00:11:59,327 --> 00:12:01,522
Phyllis, go ahead, I'm listening.

245
00:12:01,687 --> 00:12:03,837
PHYLLIS [ON PHONE]:
<i>My cat ran away last Wednesday.</i>

246
00:12:04,007 --> 00:12:07,283
<i>She's orange with a white chest and</i>
<i>one white paw. Her name is</i>...

247
00:12:07,447 --> 00:12:08,436
Wait, wait, Phyllis...

248
00:12:08,607 --> 00:12:09,881
PHYLLIS [ON PHONE]:
<i>So if anyone</i>...

249
00:12:10,047 --> 00:12:11,685
All right, hold on, hold on a minute.

250
00:12:11,847 --> 00:12:13,678
All right, now listen to me, people,

251
00:12:13,847 --> 00:12:17,806
I don't want to turn this show into
the lost and found bin of the airwaves.

252
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:20,637
Phyllis, I'm gonna let you
finish your description,

253
00:12:20,807 --> 00:12:23,082
and then we're going back
to our regular show. All right?

254
00:12:23,247 --> 00:12:25,078
PHYLLIS [ON PHONE]:
<i>Okay. She has green eyes,</i>

255
00:12:25,247 --> 00:12:28,398
<i>a rhinestone collar,</i>
<i>and when she's happy...</i>

256
00:12:28,567 --> 00:12:30,603
Let's recap.

257
00:12:30,767 --> 00:12:33,201
Uh, in the last three hours,

258
00:12:33,607 --> 00:12:37,156
we have located
a missing engagement ring,

259
00:12:37,327 --> 00:12:39,557
one lost cufflink,

260
00:12:39,727 --> 00:12:41,479
two missing cats,

261
00:12:41,647 --> 00:12:46,277
and we've actually reunited Eric from
Belltown with his biological parents.

262
00:12:48,407 --> 00:12:52,844
Still, sadly,
no sign of my missing tape.

263
00:12:53,327 --> 00:12:54,316
To that end, listeners,

264
00:12:54,487 --> 00:12:59,481
please scour your attics, basements,
hope chests, whatever.

265
00:12:59,647 --> 00:13:01,160
Meantime, this is Dr. Frasier Crane,

266
00:13:01,327 --> 00:13:03,716
wishing you good day
and good mental health.

267
00:13:03,887 --> 00:13:08,165
And don't forget
to look behind things.

268
00:13:10,607 --> 00:13:13,440
- I'm sorry, Frasier.
- Oh...

269
00:13:13,607 --> 00:13:15,438
That's all right, Roz.
I mean, it'll turn up.

270
00:13:15,607 --> 00:13:17,677
I mean, it's only the first day.
Word will get around.

271
00:13:17,847 --> 00:13:20,202
I'm... I'm sure somebody
has that tape.

272
00:13:20,367 --> 00:13:22,722
I just don't want you
to get your hopes up too high.

273
00:13:22,887 --> 00:13:26,323
Chances are
that tape is gone for good.

274
00:13:26,487 --> 00:13:28,842
Well, if that's the case, then so be it.

275
00:13:29,007 --> 00:13:31,919
Life will go on, ha, ha.

276
00:13:52,607 --> 00:13:54,279
DAPHNE:
Hello, Dr. Crane.

277
00:13:54,447 --> 00:13:56,403
How was your nap?

278
00:13:59,007 --> 00:14:00,759
It was lovely.

279
00:14:02,847 --> 00:14:05,441
Daphne, could you make me
a cup of tea, please,

280
00:14:05,607 --> 00:14:09,566
and whatever meal would be
appropriate to this time of day?

281
00:14:12,207 --> 00:14:14,675
Dr. Crane,
you've been in bed all weekend.

282
00:14:14,847 --> 00:14:17,441
How about going for a nice walk?

283
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:19,563
No, thanks.

284
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:22,245
Well, how about
going to a movie then?

285
00:14:22,407 --> 00:14:24,079
Take your mind off your troubles.

286
00:14:24,247 --> 00:14:25,475
My car's in the shop.

287
00:14:25,647 --> 00:14:28,002
You could take public transportation.

288
00:14:28,647 --> 00:14:30,399
[LAUGHS]

289
00:14:31,487 --> 00:14:32,602
[DOORBELL RINGS]

290
00:14:32,767 --> 00:14:37,238
Oh, I wonder who this could be.

291
00:14:38,687 --> 00:14:42,680
Oh, look, it's your brother Niles,
here for a visit.

292
00:14:44,767 --> 00:14:48,601
Hello, Frasier, how are we today?

293
00:14:48,767 --> 00:14:50,678
What the hell is wrong
with the two of you?

294
00:14:50,847 --> 00:14:52,838
You'd think I'd been found
walking through the park

295
00:14:53,007 --> 00:14:54,884
in my underwear, talking to pigeons.

296
00:14:55,367 --> 00:14:58,359
- Would we like a walk in the park?
- Oh, good God.

297
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:01,363
All right, all right.
Frasier, Frasier, wait.

298
00:15:01,527 --> 00:15:04,485
Hey, looking good, buddy.

299
00:15:06,127 --> 00:15:08,846
- Not any better, huh?
- No, and I feel just awful.

300
00:15:09,007 --> 00:15:10,759
- This is all my fault.
- Oh, come on.

301
00:15:10,927 --> 00:15:12,918
I'm the one who ruined
his treasured collection.

302
00:15:13,087 --> 00:15:16,363
Oh, all his crap is treasured.

303
00:15:17,127 --> 00:15:20,597
But look, don't feel bad.
I've broken lots of his stuff.

304
00:15:20,767 --> 00:15:22,883
I've never heard of you
breaking anything.

305
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:25,800
Well, that's because I know
how to cover my tracks.

306
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:29,437
Take a look at that fertility god statue
over there.

307
00:15:29,607 --> 00:15:33,441
It used to be a lot more fertile,

Oh, my God! This is a Tootsie Roll!

- That's brilliant!
- Oh, that's nothing.

Two years ago Eddie and I
were horsing around.

312
00:15:49,567 --> 00:15:52,286
I knocked it over. It took me hours
to glue it back together again.

313

Why, you can't even tell.

314
00:15:54,207 --> 00:15:56,482
I had no idea you were so devious.

Ha. Come on, I'll show you

00:16:02,647 --> 00:16:05,798
Listen, Niles, I appreciate
your concern, I really do, but, frankly,

318
00:16:05,967 --> 00:16:08,481
I am in no mood to endure therapy
with my younger brother,

319
00:16:08,647 --> 00:16:11,161
- no matter how well-intentioned.
- I'm not trying to butt in,

320
00:16:11,327 --> 00:16:15,320
I'm just curious as to
why this tape matters so much to you.

321
00:16:15,487 --> 00:16:16,806
Do you ever listen to these?

322
00:16:17,207 --> 00:16:18,799
Once.

323
00:16:19,447 --> 00:16:22,439
When I had a date over.

324
00:16:23,007 --> 00:16:26,636
It proved a useful mood-setter.

325
00:16:28,047 --> 00:16:29,605
Okay.

326
00:16:31,247 --> 00:16:32,316
Well, tell me this, then.

327
00:16:32,487 --> 00:16:34,842
Do you ever intend to listen
to any of the others?

328
00:16:35,527 --> 00:16:36,562
I don't know.

329
00:16:36,727 --> 00:16:40,766
So why is it so important to you
to have each and every one of them?

330
00:16:40,927 --> 00:16:43,919
Because it's a collection, Niles.
That's what a collection is.

331
00:16:44,087 --> 00:16:48,239
Is it possible that a harmless collection
has become an unhealthy obsession?

332
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:51,804
- It's... It's just a hobby, all right?
- Or an obsession.

333
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:54,037
- Yeah, an eccentricity.
- Or an obsession.

334
00:16:54,207 --> 00:16:56,198
It, you know, it's a quirk.

335
00:16:56,367 --> 00:16:59,279
That's it. I'm quirky.
I'm delightfully quirky.

336
00:17:00,567 --> 00:17:04,799
Do you realise that your delightful quirk
has brought your life to a standstill?

337

Niles, I've just finished
my 2000th show.

00:17:10,327 --> 00:17:15,082
I'm exhausted,
physically and emotionally.

339
00:17:15,247 --> 00:17:20,605
I believe that I am entitled to
an entire weekend of doing nothing,

You know,
you have your pyjamas on backwards.

342

Yes, well, uh, I'll tend to this
by and by.

- I'll put on pants.

you were bringing someone.

Hi. Yes. Yeah, didn't you, uh, fill in
on Frasier's show a couple of times?

Oh, yes, actually I did.

Please. If you don't mind,

I was hoping that you would
take a picture of Frasier and I.

this man is deeply disturbed.

So, uh, Tom,

I take it you've been listening
to the show for some time.

00:21:08,167 --> 00:21:10,886

that eventually I started taping them

00:21:11,047 --> 00:21:12,639
so that I didn't miss anything.

422
00:21:12,807 --> 00:21:14,525
I even was skipping out
of work early

00:21:14,687 --> 00:21:16,484
so I could make sure
to be home in time.

So, in a way, Tom,

425
00:21:18,087 --> 00:21:21,682
you could say that your obsession
with your collection

426
00:21:21,847 --> 00:21:24,202
was bringing your life to a standstill.

Oh, good for you, Tom.

431
00:21:33,527 --> 00:21:37,566
So you could say that, uh, it is possible
to have a passion for collecting

432
00:21:37,727 --> 00:21:39,604
without losing sight of your priorities.

433
00:21:39,767 --> 00:21:43,043
Yes, exactly. And...
And that's why I quit my job.

00:21:43,207 --> 00:21:46,085
Oh, this turned out really nice.

435
00:21:46,247 --> 00:21:48,681
And, you know,
eventually the money ran out,

436
00:21:48,847 --> 00:21:51,122
so I got a gig as a night doorman.

437
00:21:51,287 --> 00:21:53,084
And that way I could, uh...

438
00:21:53,247 --> 00:21:54,999
Oh. I could, you know, uh,
listen to the show

a second time on my Walkman,

440
00:21:57,487 --> 00:21:59,955
and then I could do
my transcriptions at work.

441
00:22:00,847 --> 00:22:06,205
- You transcribe the show?
- Well, you gotta have a backup.

442
00:22:07,767 --> 00:22:09,883
Uh, listen, Tom, you know,
I must confess,

443
00:22:10,047 --> 00:22:12,561
I'm a... I'm a bit concerned. Um.

444
00:22:13,567 --> 00:22:16,798
I'm delighted to have you as a fan.
I really am,

445

447
00:22:23,607 --> 00:22:25,837
and I'm afraid that I've hurt yours.

448
00:22:26,447 --> 00:22:27,675

There should be more.

451
00:22:33,807 --> 00:22:35,923
Yes, but as you always say,

452
00:22:36,087 --> 00:22:40,126
life is most fulfilling when
spent in the pursuit of one's passions.

453
00:22:40,287 --> 00:22:42,243
Yes, but as I've also said,

weave the tapestry of your life
with many diverse threads.

455
00:22:48,167 --> 00:22:50,123
Ah, yes, but you added,

456
00:22:50,287 --> 00:22:55,236
make sure to weave the pattern
that pleases you most.

457
00:22:56,967 --> 00:23:00,198
Weave the tapestry
with diverse threads?

458

Yes. Frasier said all of these things,
and many others.

00:23:04,767 --> 00:23:06,883
He is a genius.

460
00:23:07,047 --> 00:23:09,402
Would you like some guacamole?

461
00:23:10,167 --> 00:23:12,476
- Uh, yeah, sure. Uh.
- Thank you.

462
00:23:12,967 --> 00:23:16,676
Thanks, Tom. Listen, I'm...
I'm just, uh, thinking. Um.

463
00:23:16,847 --> 00:23:18,599
I don't really want
to talk you into anything.

464
00:23:18,767 --> 00:23:21,998
It seems I've done enough
of that already. I, uh...

465
00:23:23,487 --> 00:23:25,284
Thank you.

466
00:23:25,847 --> 00:23:28,839
Tom, what I'm getting at here is,

467
00:23:29,007 --> 00:23:32,204
I think there could be
more to your life

468
00:23:32,367 --> 00:23:37,236
than just my tapes and pictures.

469
00:23:37,407 --> 00:23:41,400
Now, if you'd be interested in
exploring those issues further,

470
00:23:41,567 --> 00:23:44,764
I can recommend someone
who would be glad to talk with you.

471
00:23:44,927 --> 00:23:49,284
[MOUTHING] <i>Not me. Not me.</i>
- Why? I have you.

472
00:23:53,247 --> 00:23:54,839
Thank you.

473
00:23:56,407 --> 00:23:58,841
Well, you know, l...
I think it's time we got going.

474
00:23:59,007 --> 00:24:00,406
Oh, no, so soon?

475
00:24:00,567 --> 00:24:02,000
Oh, well, I suppose
someone like you

476
00:24:02,167 --> 00:24:03,839
probably has a lot of things
they gotta do.

477
00:24:04,007 --> 00:24:05,679
- Right.
- I'm glad you could come at all.

478
00:24:05,847 --> 00:24:08,645
Please, you know,
stop by any time you want.

479
00:24:08,807 --> 00:24:11,162
Thank you, Tom,
and it was a pleasure.

480
00:24:11,327 --> 00:24:13,841
Oh, don't forget your tape.

481
00:24:16,087 --> 00:24:17,964
You know, Tom,

482
00:24:18,127 --> 00:24:19,446
I'd like you to keep that.

483
00:24:19,607 --> 00:24:21,643
But this is the reason you came.

484
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:24,477
If I ever need it,

485
00:24:24,647 --> 00:24:26,080
I'll know where to find it.

486
00:24:31,487 --> 00:24:33,045
Um...

487
00:24:33,207 --> 00:24:36,119
You know those shows
where I sat in for Frasier?

488
00:24:38,287 --> 00:24:40,755
You wouldn't happen to
have those tapes, would you?

489
00:24:40,927 --> 00:24:43,760
Sorry, l... I don't collect just anything.

490
00:24:49,927 --> 00:24:53,363
Hey, there he is.
Did you get your tape back?

491
00:24:53,527 --> 00:24:54,926
Actually, no, I didn't.

492
00:24:55,087 --> 00:24:56,645
What happened?

493
00:24:57,007 --> 00:24:58,838
Daphne...

494
00:24:59,807 --> 00:25:02,002
...tonight I saw an example

495
00:25:02,767 --> 00:25:06,282
of how an obsession
can take over a man's life.

496
00:25:07,487 --> 00:25:09,842
I don't want to be that man.

497
00:25:10,407 --> 00:25:15,527
Therefore, I chose to leave it
and render my collection imperfect.

498
00:25:16,007 --> 00:25:17,838
But that's all right. You see,

499
00:25:18,447 --> 00:25:21,007
I don't need things to be perfect.

500
00:25:24,247 --> 00:25:25,999
Hello.

501
00:25:28,487 --> 00:25:30,478
Something's amiss.

502
00:25:31,407 --> 00:25:32,476
[GASPS]

503
00:25:32,647 --> 00:25:35,400
My double-handled amphora!

504
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:37,956
All right, no one leaves!
