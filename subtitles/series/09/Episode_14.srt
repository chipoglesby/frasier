problems that seem crushing now

3
00:00:13,767 --> 00:00:17,203

in positive ways later on.

<i>You're just saying that.</i>

5
00:00:19,487 --> 00:00:22,320
No. Well, I'll tell you what. Perhaps
I can convince you with a story.

6
00:00:22,487 --> 00:00:26,560
I recall a young man who suffered
from involuntary bed-wetting

7
00:00:26,727 --> 00:00:29,161
until he was 12 years old.

8
00:00:29,327 --> 00:00:31,477
Or was it 13?

9
00:00:31,647 --> 00:00:35,117
Boy, you'd think I'd remember.
I slept in the lower bunk.

10
00:00:35,687 --> 00:00:38,155
The point is,
it was very difficult for him,

11
00:00:38,327 --> 00:00:42,081
what with, uh, the alarms
and the bladder-stretching exercises,

12
00:00:42,247 --> 00:00:45,523
and the incessant teasing he suffered
once his schoolmates found out.

13
00:00:45,687 --> 00:00:46,915
JEREMY:
<i>How'd they find out?</i>

14
00:00:47,087 --> 00:00:51,717
Well, the point I'm trying to make here
is that this man today

15
00:00:51,887 --> 00:00:54,845
is a prominent and respected
psychiatrist.

16
00:00:55,287 --> 00:00:58,404
And, you see, his afflictions
served to make him stronger,

17
00:00:58,567 --> 00:01:02,446
more empathic,
and extremely hygienic.

18
00:01:03,007 --> 00:01:05,237
- So hang in there, Jeremy.
JEREMY: <i>Okay.</i>

- <i>Thanks, Dr. Crane.</i>
- Thank you.

This is Dr. Frasier Crane saying
good day and good mental health.

I never knew
that the Indians of the rainforest

used to stretch out pig intestines

But it's like we have this connection,
you know?

331
00:15:47,327 --> 00:15:49,557
I mean, somehow we know
when we wanna be dumb

and when we wanna be boring.

The 20 years I have known you
would've been less painful

00:17:26,327 --> 00:17:29,842
if I was covered with open sores
and thrown into a pit

"Maybe I shouldn't go to Florida
and leave all my friends."

I am gonna stay.
