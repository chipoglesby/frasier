312
00:14:52,487 --> 00:14:54,478
You took the batteries
out of my remote.

313
00:14:54,687 --> 00:14:58,760
Gosh, I'm sorry, Dad.
I needed them for my foot spa.

314
00:14:58,927 --> 00:15:00,918
And you had to take them
out of the one thing

315
00:15:01,087 --> 00:15:02,600
I need batteries for in this house?

316
00:15:02,767 --> 00:15:06,157
God forbid your royal feet
go without eucalyptus...

317
00:15:06,367 --> 00:15:07,800
Dad.

318
00:15:13,007 --> 00:15:14,360
That's all right.

319
00:15:14,527 --> 00:15:16,677
There's gotta be some other way
to switch the channels.

320
00:15:16,887 --> 00:15:18,206
DAPHNE:
Bye.

321
00:15:18,407 --> 00:15:20,045
Well, I'll go and open
that can of soup.

322
00:15:20,207 --> 00:15:21,925
Oh, would you turn the game on?

323
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:23,076
Sports?

324
00:15:23,247 --> 00:15:25,124
Hmm, might be a bit too exciting.

325
00:15:25,327 --> 00:15:27,795
Why don't we just watch
a nice, soothing movie?

326
00:15:28,007 --> 00:15:29,963
- Like what?
- How about <i>Message in a Bottle?</i>

327
00:15:30,167 --> 00:15:33,045
Is that one of those movies that takes
45 minutes for anything to happen,

328
00:15:33,207 --> 00:15:35,641
and then you're sorry it did?

329
00:15:36,487 --> 00:15:40,241
If you don't like that, we could watch
<i>To Gillian on Her 37th Birthday</i>.

330
00:15:47,887 --> 00:15:50,276
- You pick.
- Yes.

331
00:15:52,887 --> 00:15:55,321
- Niles.
- Well, imagine my surprise

332
00:15:55,487 --> 00:15:58,047
seeing the two of you here,
when the three of us have reservations

333
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,482
for dinner at Le Cigare Volant
in half an hour.

334
00:16:00,687 --> 00:16:04,999
Hi, Dr. Crane. Dr. Crane invited me
here for a before-dinner cocoa.

335
00:16:05,207 --> 00:16:08,165
Isn't that nice?
Frasier, may I have a word?

336
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:11,359
Yes, of course, Niles.
Kirby, we'll be right back.

337
00:16:12,927 --> 00:16:14,963
All right.
Now, before you get started,

338
00:16:15,167 --> 00:16:17,237
I brought the boy here in order
to ease him into this.

339
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:20,444
I was afraid that the sight of us might
bring up some unpleasant memories.

340
00:16:20,607 --> 00:16:22,199
I see.
So this has nothing to do with you

341
00:16:22,367 --> 00:16:25,404
trying to get into Grampy Mulvehill's
wine cellar instead of me?

342
00:16:25,607 --> 00:16:29,600
The fact that you even said that
speaks volumes about you.

343
00:16:29,807 --> 00:16:32,560
Let's get back before the boy
starts to think we're talking about him.

344
00:16:33,247 --> 00:16:34,965
We're back now.

345
00:16:35,847 --> 00:16:38,998
Kirby, I just want to tell you
how sorry I am

346
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:41,840
for both Frasier
and my behaviour earlier.

347
00:16:42,047 --> 00:16:43,241
It's no problem. I forgave you

348
00:16:43,407 --> 00:16:46,558
as soon as I got that DVD player
you sent me.

349
00:16:49,047 --> 00:16:50,844
Niles, may I see you for a moment?

350
00:16:54,607 --> 00:16:55,926
- DVD player?
- Okay.

351
00:16:56,127 --> 00:16:58,766
You caught me in a selfish moment.
I was trying to assuage my guilt

352
00:16:58,927 --> 00:17:00,042
for the way I treated him.

353
00:17:00,247 --> 00:17:03,239
You weren't trying to buy loyalty so you
could benefit from your connection,

354
00:17:03,407 --> 00:17:07,480
reviving your woefully flagging
reputation in the wine community?

355
00:17:08,167 --> 00:17:10,317
I categorically deny that.

356
00:17:10,527 --> 00:17:11,801
So you did it just to burn me?

357
00:17:11,967 --> 00:17:14,037
- I deny that.
- But not categorically.

358
00:17:14,207 --> 00:17:16,482
Frasier, do I have to remind you

359
00:17:16,647 --> 00:17:18,365
that this is not about us,
it's about Kirby,

360
00:17:18,527 --> 00:17:20,882
whom we've abandoned
in order to have this petty spat.

361
00:17:22,967 --> 00:17:25,037
FRASIER:
We're back again.

362
00:17:25,207 --> 00:17:28,085
So, Kirby, where were we?

363
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:30,807
You were asking me
about Grampy's wine cellar.

364
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:33,003
- Frasier?
- Not now, Niles.

365
00:17:33,167 --> 00:17:35,158
Fine. I was going to leave this
till later, but...

366
00:17:35,367 --> 00:17:39,121
Kirby, I saw these,
and I thought of you.

367

369
00:17:43,207 --> 00:17:44,640
Oh, I measured the footprint you left

370
00:17:44,807 --> 00:17:47,958
in doughnut powder on my floor,
you rascal.

371
00:17:48,727 --> 00:17:50,319
These are awesome.
Aren't they, Dr. Crane?

372
00:17:50,487 --> 00:17:52,523
Oh, yes, indeed they are, Kirby.

373
00:17:52,727 --> 00:17:56,356
You know, you're going to need
some togs to go with them.

374
00:17:56,527 --> 00:17:57,721
I have an account at Bidwells.

375
00:17:57,887 --> 00:17:59,684
What do you say I call them
and set you up?

376
00:17:59,887 --> 00:18:03,277
Wow, thanks.
I never had togs before.

377

You guys are so great,

my self-esteem and all.

I could take you both to the wine cellar.

380
00:18:10,327 --> 00:18:12,318
But I can't.

- Frasier.

Do you believe the nerve of this boy,
pitting us against each other?

383

We're not going to be manipulated.

384

We certainly aren't.
All right, let's put a stop to it right now.

FRASIER: He can't go to Vegas.

390
00:18:38,407 --> 00:18:41,285
He'll be too busy
interning at the radio station.

391
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:43,239
No way.
