1
00:00:15,047 --> 00:00:16,639
There he is, Niles.

2
00:00:16,807 --> 00:00:18,365
That's our Yorick.

3
00:00:20,127 --> 00:00:21,526
He's perfect, Frasier.

4
00:00:24,127 --> 00:00:27,915
The missing link
for our backyard production of <i>Hamlet.</i>

5
00:00:28,087 --> 00:00:30,396
Exactly what I was thinking.

6
00:00:30,567 --> 00:00:32,398
Now get up there.

7
00:00:32,567 --> 00:00:36,355
- Why me?
- Because I'm the director, that's why.

8
00:00:37,807 --> 00:00:39,763
Come on.

9
00:00:42,087 --> 00:00:43,600
Just get up there.

10
00:00:46,967 --> 00:00:52,405
- "Alas, poor Yorick, I knew him..."
- Knock it off. Ow.

11
00:00:52,567 --> 00:00:54,956
- Are you okay?
- No.

12
00:00:55,127 --> 00:00:57,516
You cracked my skull.

13
00:01:00,967 --> 00:01:02,241
FRASIER:
May I get a double latte?

14
00:01:02,407 --> 00:01:04,204
One shot decaf espresso,
one shot of regular espresso,

15
00:01:04,367 --> 00:01:06,722
streamed low-fat milk
and some non-fat foam.

16
00:01:06,887 --> 00:01:08,400
Sure.

17
00:01:12,687 --> 00:01:13,722
Well?

18
00:01:13,887 --> 00:01:16,640
He didn't even blink an eye.
The man's unflappable.

19
00:01:16,807 --> 00:01:17,842
He's amazing, isn't he?

20
00:01:18,007 --> 00:01:21,886
He made me a Chai Spice
Ristretto-Americano con Panna

21
00:01:22,047 --> 00:01:24,845
as if people had been drinking them
for centuries.

22
00:01:25,007 --> 00:01:27,123
Truly, this is a golden age.

23
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:29,881
Oh, did Dad tell you?
Our old house is on the market.

24
00:01:30,047 --> 00:01:31,162
FRASIER:
It doesn't surprise me.

25
00:01:31,327 --> 00:01:33,921
That whole area's undergoing
what they call a revitalization.

26
00:01:34,087 --> 00:01:37,238
Of course, they'll probably just tear
it down and put up a Benetton.

27
00:01:37,407 --> 00:01:41,082
Bath & Body Works
or Sunglass Hut.

28
00:01:41,247 --> 00:01:42,839
I sort of like Bath & Body Works.

29
00:01:43,007 --> 00:01:44,759
I do, too.

30
00:01:45,247 --> 00:01:47,522
I had this crazy thought, Frasier.

31
00:01:47,687 --> 00:01:49,245
What if we bought the house?

32
00:01:49,967 --> 00:01:51,320
You mean as a rental property?

33
00:01:51,487 --> 00:01:56,117
Perhaps. Or as a guest maisonette
for our out-of-town visitors.

34
00:01:56,287 --> 00:01:59,563
- Daphne's mother, perhaps?
- Oh, hadn't thought of that.

35
00:01:59,727 --> 00:02:00,796
That's a good idea.

36
00:02:00,967 --> 00:02:03,800
Buy her a house
and she'll never leave.

37
00:02:04,287 --> 00:02:07,677
You know, Niles, we could open it up
to the general public.

38
00:02:07,847 --> 00:02:11,442
- That's not a bad idea. A warm bed...
- A freshly baked scone.

39
00:02:11,607 --> 00:02:13,723
- A moderate fee.
- It would pay for itself.

40
00:02:13,887 --> 00:02:15,479
As B and B.

41
00:02:15,647 --> 00:02:17,683
If you two break into song,
I'm leaving.

44
00:02:22,247 --> 00:02:23,999
- I'm sorry.
- That's all right. Have a seat.

45
00:02:24,167 --> 00:02:28,206
I just bought Alice a new hamster
and it's kept me up all night

46
00:02:28,367 --> 00:02:32,679
running around
on that squeaky, damn wheel.

47
00:02:32,847 --> 00:02:34,599
Why don't you get it
a quieter wheel?

48
00:02:34,767 --> 00:02:37,042
- Or oil the squeak?
- Or take the wheel out at night?

49
00:02:37,207 --> 00:02:39,641
Or put the cage in another room?

50
00:02:41,447 --> 00:02:42,436
Thank you.

51
00:02:42,607 --> 00:02:44,006
Where were you all
at 3 this morning

52
00:02:44,167 --> 00:02:47,398
when I was trying to shove a Sominex
into a carrot?

53
00:02:48,327 --> 00:02:52,115
I used to have the same problem
when I was raising showrats.

54
00:02:55,727 --> 00:02:59,561
You don't mean the nasty,
plague-propagating vermin, do you?

55
00:02:59,727 --> 00:03:05,916
No, I mean purebred rats,
as in Siamese or Himalayan or husky.

56
00:03:06,087 --> 00:03:08,965
My most prized one
was an Andalusian Blue

57
00:03:09,127 --> 00:03:12,244
named Lady Prissy
and she wasn't sick a day in her life.

58
00:03:12,407 --> 00:03:16,798
So don't go blaming all rats
just because of a few bad apples.

59
00:03:17,327 --> 00:03:18,965
A few bad apples?

60
00:03:19,127 --> 00:03:22,642
Daphne, they spread a disease
that nearly wiped out half of Europe.

61
00:03:22,807 --> 00:03:24,160
Shows what you know.

62
00:03:24,327 --> 00:03:27,205
Those were
common European brown rats.

63
00:03:27,367 --> 00:03:28,959
- Yes, but the point...
DAPHNE: Oh, no, no.

64
00:03:29,127 --> 00:03:31,595
I'll sit here and listen to you
prattle on about wine and opera

65
00:03:31,767 --> 00:03:34,964
but when it comes to rats,
you're in my house.

66
00:03:40,087 --> 00:03:42,476
MARTIN: Old man Lasskopf
must have owned this place 50 years.

67
00:03:42,647 --> 00:03:45,639
MARTIN: Wonder why he's selling.
- He can get 50 times what he paid.

68
00:03:45,807 --> 00:03:47,957
Yeah, he sure knew how
to squeeze a penny.

69
00:03:48,127 --> 00:03:50,516
You know, he never gave me back
my security deposit.

70
00:03:50,687 --> 00:03:52,040
I might just bring that up.

71
00:03:52,207 --> 00:03:54,641
Oh, no, you won't.

72
00:03:54,807 --> 00:03:57,719
Once we turn this into a B and B,
you'll make it all back in tips.

73
00:03:57,887 --> 00:04:00,526
What the hell is that supposed to...

74
00:04:00,687 --> 00:04:02,598
Oh, Mr. Lasskopf,
so good to see you again.

75
00:04:02,767 --> 00:04:04,246
It's been a long time.

76
00:04:04,407 --> 00:04:06,079
What has?

77
00:04:06,807 --> 00:04:08,559
- We used to rent this house from you.
- Yes.

78
00:04:08,727 --> 00:04:11,036
I'm Niles Crane.
This is my brother Frasier and our dad.

79
00:04:11,207 --> 00:04:12,720
You remember?

80
00:04:13,087 --> 00:04:14,520
Nope.

81
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:16,439
Nope.

82
00:04:16,607 --> 00:04:18,040
You sort of look familiar.

83
00:04:18,207 --> 00:04:21,279
I should. Paid you rent for ten years,
left the place in perfect condition,

84
00:04:21,447 --> 00:04:24,325
and you never gave me back
my security deposit.

85
00:04:25,207 --> 00:04:28,005
Nope, don't remember you either.
Come on in.

86
00:04:28,687 --> 00:04:30,166
Go ahead, Dad.

87
00:04:30,327 --> 00:04:34,240
Oh, boy, this brings back memories.

88
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:36,204
Oh, Niles, do you remember

89
00:04:36,727 --> 00:04:38,524
doing our homework
at the dining room table?

90
00:04:38,687 --> 00:04:39,722
NILES:
Oh, yes.

91
00:04:39,887 --> 00:04:41,525
Afternoon piano lessons.

92
00:04:41,687 --> 00:04:44,042
Getting haircuts from your mother.

93
00:04:44,207 --> 00:04:46,960
And Mom's roll-top desk
on this wall over here.

94
00:04:47,127 --> 00:04:50,597
Where we wrote
all the <i>Crane Boys Mysteries.</i>

95
00:04:51,247 --> 00:04:53,920
I can still see you pacing
in your writer's tweeds

96
00:04:54,087 --> 00:04:56,965
and half glasses, dictating.

97
00:04:57,127 --> 00:04:59,482
And you
in your shawl collar sweater,

98
00:04:59,647 --> 00:05:02,366
hammering away at the keys
of that old Royal typewriter.

99
00:05:02,527 --> 00:05:04,165
Oh, gosh.

100
00:05:04,327 --> 00:05:05,442
When did those two crazy kids

101
00:05:05,607 --> 00:05:08,485
become such a pair
of old fuddy-duddies?

102
00:05:10,407 --> 00:05:11,522
Oh, Niles.

103
00:05:11,687 --> 00:05:14,520
Do you remember, here's the window
we used to sneak out of after curfew.

104
00:05:14,687 --> 00:05:16,166
Really? You did?
I never knew that.

105
00:05:16,327 --> 00:05:20,605
Sure, Dad. We used to go out
and chase the girls

106
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:22,962
and have a drink or two.

107
00:05:23,127 --> 00:05:26,517
Well, boys will be boys.

108
00:05:26,687 --> 00:05:28,006
- Frasier.
- Hmm?

109
00:05:31,487 --> 00:05:34,957
We didn't chase girls.
We went out to foreign films.

110
00:05:35,127 --> 00:05:37,482
Do you think Dad wants to hear that?
Throw the guy a bone.

111
00:05:39,287 --> 00:05:41,755
So, what made you finally decide
to sell?

112
00:05:41,927 --> 00:05:45,442
- Moving to the Cayman Islands.
- That'll be a change from Seattle.

113
00:05:45,607 --> 00:05:46,756
Gee, you think?

114
00:05:49,127 --> 00:05:51,561
Hear they have great scuba diving
down there. You scuba?

115
00:05:51,727 --> 00:05:54,287
Do I look like I scuba?

116
00:05:54,927 --> 00:05:58,283
I'm lucky I don't need a tank
to breathe on land.

117
00:05:59,247 --> 00:06:00,839
Just looking for a change of scenery,
huh?

118
00:06:01,007 --> 00:06:02,599
Looking to be left alone.

119
00:06:03,287 --> 00:06:06,597
I'm not what you call
a real social type.

120
00:06:06,767 --> 00:06:09,725
You sure made friends
with my security deposit.

121
00:06:10,967 --> 00:06:12,366
You know, Niles, you're right.

122
00:06:12,527 --> 00:06:14,245
It's not big enough
for a bed and breakfast.

123
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:16,796
No, but it did give us a nice walk
down memory lane.

124
00:06:16,967 --> 00:06:18,446
Yes.

125
00:06:18,607 --> 00:06:20,120
Niles?

126
00:06:20,767 --> 00:06:24,760
Didn't we stash a memory box
underneath one of these floorboards

127
00:06:24,927 --> 00:06:25,962
right around here?

128
00:06:26,127 --> 00:06:28,197
What? I thought you took that with you
when we moved.

129
00:06:28,367 --> 00:06:30,244
I thought you took it.

130
00:06:30,407 --> 00:06:32,523
- Do you suppose it's still here?
- Well, it must be.

131
00:06:32,687 --> 00:06:36,077
Would you mind if my brother and I
had a look underneath here?

132
00:06:36,247 --> 00:06:39,205
You see, we left a sort
of a time capsule underneath there.

133
00:06:39,367 --> 00:06:42,359
Oh, no, you don't.
Nobody's pulling up any floor here.

134
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:44,165
No, we don't need to.
The board was loose.

135
00:06:44,327 --> 00:06:46,283
There's no loose boards.

136
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:48,642
They've all been nailed down.
I made sure of that.

137
00:06:48,807 --> 00:06:51,196
Couldn't we just check?
Look, I came here to sell this place,

138
00:06:51,367 --> 00:06:53,005
not have it torn apart.

139
00:06:53,167 --> 00:06:56,603
So are you serious buyers
or are we wasting our time here?

140
00:06:56,767 --> 00:07:00,237
Allowing us to reclaim a small part
of our past is hardly a waste of time.

141
00:07:00,407 --> 00:07:03,399
Well, it sounds like a load
of tomfoolery to me.

142
00:07:03,567 --> 00:07:05,444
- Let's go.
FRASIER: Mr. Lasskopf,

143
00:07:05,607 --> 00:07:08,041
I assure you my brother and I
give tomfoolery no quarter.

144
00:07:08,207 --> 00:07:10,323
- We never have.
LASSKOPF: Oh, no?

145
00:07:10,487 --> 00:07:13,718
What do you call sneaking out
to drink and chase girls?

146
00:07:13,887 --> 00:07:16,765
No, no, no, that wasn't true.
We went out to see foreign films.

147
00:07:17,847 --> 00:07:19,678
I knew it.

148
00:07:20,647 --> 00:07:22,046
No, no, wait.

149
00:07:32,927 --> 00:07:35,236
NILES:
There we go.

150
00:07:35,407 --> 00:07:36,999
Well done, Frasier.

151
00:07:37,167 --> 00:07:39,761
- You've still got it.
- Thank you, Niles.

152
00:07:39,927 --> 00:07:41,838
It's just like riding a bicycle.

153
00:07:42,007 --> 00:07:42,996
- Here we go.
- All right,

154
00:07:43,167 --> 00:07:45,886
let's just find our memory box
and get the hell out of here.

155
00:07:46,047 --> 00:07:50,040
Now, I think it's around here
somewhere, hmm?

156
00:07:50,207 --> 00:07:51,606
It's, uh...

157
00:07:55,047 --> 00:07:58,039
I've got it. I've got it. I've got it.

Okay, okay.

down there. There could be rats.

I wonder who it could be.

Well, perhaps it's a builder
who got trapped during construction.

Or...

Interesting hypotheses, Niles.
Unfortunately, neither is plausible.

And that evening
my dad sat on the bed next to me

- We have a victim or part of one.

Can we establish motive?

00:15:32,087 --> 00:15:35,284
- He's emasculated.
- Desperately.

315
00:15:36,127 --> 00:15:40,484
And so he hatches a plan.

316
00:15:40,647 --> 00:15:45,926
"Darling,
why don't we evict the Cranes?

317
00:15:46,087 --> 00:15:48,476
We don't need their rent money
anymore."

318
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:50,558
"No,
thanks to my family's frugal nature

319
00:15:50,727 --> 00:15:52,797
and untimely death."

320
00:15:52,967 --> 00:15:57,324
And so out go the Cranes
and the house is empty.

321
00:15:57,487 --> 00:15:59,318
"Darling,

322
00:15:59,887 --> 00:16:03,323
why don't we go and see
in what condition

323
00:16:03,487 --> 00:16:07,082
the Cranes have left the house?"
Hmm?

324
00:16:07,247 --> 00:16:10,444
"You go, you lazy parasite.
I'm having my nails done."

325
00:16:12,727 --> 00:16:14,524
I mean, "Okay."

326
00:16:15,887 --> 00:16:17,240
So...

327
00:16:18,007 --> 00:16:20,680
In they stroll.

328
00:16:20,847 --> 00:16:23,486
He with murderous intent,

329
00:16:23,647 --> 00:16:26,878
she with nary an inkling
of the tragedy about to befall her.

330
00:16:29,567 --> 00:16:34,357
He pretends to inspect the house.

331
00:16:34,527 --> 00:16:35,846
"Darling...

332
00:16:36,007 --> 00:16:39,158
Why what's this mark over here
on the wall?"

333
00:16:39,327 --> 00:16:40,726
- "Where?"
- "There.

334
00:16:40,887 --> 00:16:42,559
Look.

335
00:16:43,087 --> 00:16:44,759
Closer.

336
00:16:45,287 --> 00:16:46,766
Closer."

337
00:16:46,927 --> 00:16:49,487
And as she leans in,
he does her in!

338
00:16:49,647 --> 00:16:52,719
"No, Alfred, no!"
Oh, that makes perfect sense.

339
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:57,039
We have a victim. We have a motive.
And we have evidence for both.

340
00:16:57,207 --> 00:16:59,118
If only we had a murder weapon
to tie it together.

341
00:16:59,287 --> 00:17:01,881
Niles, don't you remember?
As in many a <i>Crane Boys</i> case,

342
00:17:02,047 --> 00:17:05,198
the absence of a weapon
does not mean the absence of a crime.

343
00:17:05,367 --> 00:17:06,800
Perhaps he pushed her
down the stairs

344
00:17:06,967 --> 00:17:09,765
as in
<i>The Case of the Unhappy Landing.</i>

345
00:17:10,887 --> 00:17:12,206
I thought the title gave it away.

346
00:17:12,367 --> 00:17:15,882
Hmm. Well, then we can rename it
once we have them published.

347
00:17:16,727 --> 00:17:19,036
- You think that would ever happen?
- Are you kidding?

348
00:17:19,207 --> 00:17:22,244
Once this hits the papers.

349
00:17:27,767 --> 00:17:29,678
I'm just gonna go down
and check on the laundry.

350
00:17:29,847 --> 00:17:31,599
If Alice wakes up,
keep an eye on her.

351
00:17:31,767 --> 00:17:33,519
- What happened to Roz?
- Alice's hamster died

352
00:17:33,687 --> 00:17:35,723
so Roz nipped out to the store
to get her a new one.

353
00:17:35,887 --> 00:17:38,003
Sure. No problem.

354
00:17:43,327 --> 00:17:44,999
Where's Mommy?

355
00:17:45,167 --> 00:17:48,284
Oh, hi, hon.
Your mom will be right back.

356
00:17:49,007 --> 00:17:50,918

357
00:17:51,087 --> 00:17:53,237

so you owe me ten bucks.

360
00:18:04,287 --> 00:18:06,642
I know you do, sweetheart.

361
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:11,241
I'm sure he's up in hamster heaven
missing you too.

362
00:18:11,407 --> 00:18:13,238
What is hamster heaven?

363

Well, that's where hamsters go
when they die.

364

Mommy said he was lost.

365

Oh. Oh. Oh, no.

00:18:22,807 --> 00:18:24,684
When will he come back?

367
00:18:24,847 --> 00:18:25,836
Oh, boy.

368
00:18:26,007 --> 00:18:30,558
Well, when a hamster goes
to hamster heaven, it can't come back.

369

But that's okay.

370
00:18:32,287 --> 00:18:35,199
- Why?
- Oh, because it's great up there.

371
00:18:35,367 --> 00:18:38,120

on every corner.

372

And the streets are paved with...

373
00:18:42,167 --> 00:18:44,681
- What do hamsters eat?
- Hamster food.

374
00:18:44,847 --> 00:18:47,645
Ah, well, that's what the streets
are paved with.

375
00:18:47,807 --> 00:18:49,638
And there aren't any cats
to chase him.

376
00:18:49,807 --> 00:18:52,924
- Does cats have a heaven too?
- Oh, sure.

Yeah, same deal, except no wheels
and their streets are paved with fish.

- Yeah, dogs, too.

have a heaven.

Oh, no, not... No, not Eddie.

I mean, he's really still just a puppy.

00:19:12,807 --> 00:19:14,604

384
00:19:14,767 --> 00:19:16,246
He's about ten.

00:19:16,407 --> 00:19:19,399
That's not a puppy.

A new hamster.

New?

391
00:19:32,127 --> 00:19:33,765
What makes you think he's new?

392
00:19:33,927 --> 00:19:35,997
Because animals don't come back
from heaven.

393

- Right, Uncle Martin?
- Right.

394

We sort of had a little talk.
