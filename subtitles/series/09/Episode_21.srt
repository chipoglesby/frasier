and a proximate rhyme.

If my maligner truly knew who I was,

305
00:16:33,167 --> 00:16:35,761
Can we just give my childhood
a rest for a while?

306
00:16:35,927 --> 00:16:38,316
How would you feel if I took your most
humiliating moments

307
00:16:38,487 --> 00:16:39,476
and put them on display?

308
00:16:39,647 --> 00:16:43,003
You know, I think I've got
the perfect picture frame for this one.

309
00:16:43,447 --> 00:16:46,325
So she puts a few pictures out.
What's the big deal?

310
00:16:46,487 --> 00:16:48,603
There's a whole part of your life
she missed out on.

311
00:16:49,047 --> 00:16:50,036
Oh, I guess.

312
00:16:50,207 --> 00:16:53,916
Besides, I like seeing your old stuff.

313
00:16:54,927 --> 00:16:58,317
Oh, no one around here
draws pictures anymore.

314
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:02,366
What the hell is this supposed to be,
anyway?

315
00:17:03,047 --> 00:17:07,325
Oh, that is an Egyptian
battle scene from <i>Aida</i>.

316
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:11,997
Look, that's Radames,
and that's the jealous Amneris and...

317
00:17:12,167 --> 00:17:14,317
Look, I misspelled Amonasro.

318
00:17:17,807 --> 00:17:20,401
Oh, to be 6 again.

319
00:17:22,847 --> 00:17:26,203
- What is that?
- Some things from my childhood.

320
00:17:26,367 --> 00:17:28,597
You asked how I'd feel if the shoe
was on the other foot.

321
00:17:28,767 --> 00:17:30,644
- Go ahead, take a look.
- Oh. Okay

322
00:17:30,807 --> 00:17:32,320
Hmm.

323
00:17:33,087 --> 00:17:38,115
Oh, well, that's a wonderful drawing
of a, uh, turtle.

324
00:17:38,287 --> 00:17:41,324
No, that's my dad
crawling home from the pub.

325
00:17:42,407 --> 00:17:45,399
- Well, why did you sign it Dappy?
- Oh, my mom did that.

326
00:17:45,567 --> 00:17:48,161
My family called me Dappy
because I couldn't say Daphne.

327
00:17:48,327 --> 00:17:49,521
- Really?
- Yeah, I hated it.

328
00:17:49,687 --> 00:17:53,043
My brothers would sing,
"Dappy, Dappy, wet her nappy".

329
00:17:54,367 --> 00:17:57,040
Well, I think it's precious, Dappy.

330
00:17:57,207 --> 00:18:00,119
I'm going to call you that
from now on, Dappy.

331
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:02,721
- No, you won't.
- Well, how about I call you Dappy

332
00:18:02,887 --> 00:18:05,560
until you put mementos back in the
box? How does that sound, Dappy?

333
00:18:05,727 --> 00:18:08,480
- That's not fair.
- Oh, Dad.

334
00:18:08,967 --> 00:18:12,084
You'll never guess what silly nickname
Daphne was called as a child.

335
00:18:12,527 --> 00:18:14,563
Is it worse than Piles?

336
00:18:23,247 --> 00:18:26,000
Well, that can't bring up
fond memories.

337
00:18:31,287 --> 00:18:33,721
[TRUCK ENGINE REWING]

338
00:18:33,887 --> 00:18:37,323
Roger's here.
Could I just go see him?

339
00:18:37,767 --> 00:18:40,281
- I don't think so, sweetie.
- Why?

340
00:18:40,447 --> 00:18:45,077
- Well, it's hard to explain.
- Why?

341
00:18:45,247 --> 00:18:46,236
[SIGHS]

342
00:18:46,407 --> 00:18:49,763
- It's complicated.
- Why?

343
00:18:53,607 --> 00:18:59,204
Mommy works in an office
and Roger works in a truck.

344
00:18:59,367 --> 00:19:05,283
And people in offices and
people in trucks... It's complicated.

345
00:19:05,447 --> 00:19:08,644
- But I like Roger.
- I know, honey.

346
00:19:08,807 --> 00:19:13,244
- Do you like Roger?
- Yes, but...

347
00:19:15,207 --> 00:19:17,516
- Yeah.
- Okay.

348
00:19:19,567 --> 00:19:20,556
Okay.

349
00:19:21,567 --> 00:19:24,206
Sarah, can you look after Alice?

350
00:19:24,887 --> 00:19:27,003
I'll be right back.

351
00:19:29,287 --> 00:19:30,276
Roger.

352
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:34,036
Hi.

353
00:19:34,927 --> 00:19:37,566
I'm so sorry
that I've been such an idiot.

354
00:19:37,727 --> 00:19:39,957
I don't... I don't know
what's been wrong with me.

355
00:19:40,127 --> 00:19:42,800
All I know
is that I miss you like crazy.

356
00:19:44,807 --> 00:19:47,401
Do you still have an opening
for a Mole queen?

357
00:19:48,007 --> 00:19:49,326
You sure?
