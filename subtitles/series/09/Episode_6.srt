through the program data

on each show's average listener.

All right, let's see.

Gil's average listener is a woman,
mid-30s, well-educated. Hmm.

15
00:00:46,887 --> 00:00:49,685
What about my average listener?
Who is she?

16
00:00:49,847 --> 00:00:52,805
Well, actually, uh,
she's an older gentleman,

What?

21
00:01:04,527 --> 00:01:06,995
I'm sorry the station
spent its money on this nonsense,

"Hey, that's your name on that sign.
You should have it."

Dr. Crane, you're a popular psychiatrist
and radio personality.

What would you say
is the secret of your success?

with the fact

that I am a good listener
and have a friendly voice,

and I also try to pass along some
real psychological insight and advice.

241
00:11:58,447 --> 00:11:59,880
My research shows that your replies

less than five minutes long.

Speaking of truth,

310
00:16:26,567 --> 00:16:30,162
I have a few questions
about your last tax return.

311
00:16:31,087 --> 00:16:34,363
I hate to interrupt, panel, but it's time
for our regular news break.

312
00:16:34,527 --> 00:16:37,758
We'll be back with more
<i>Teen Scene</i> fun after this.

313
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:42,557
Dr. Crane,
could I borrow you for a second?

314
00:16:43,687 --> 00:16:44,836
You're doing great.

315
00:16:47,687 --> 00:16:51,475
- Dude, you're in trouble here.
- Thanks for the update.

316
00:16:51,647 --> 00:16:53,842
Take it easy, Mr. Snappy.

317
00:16:54,007 --> 00:16:55,565
I'm here to help you.

318
00:16:55,727 --> 00:16:57,604
Can you believe
that Kirby guy works here?

319
00:16:57,767 --> 00:16:59,598
I can't believe
they finally graduated him.

320
00:16:59,767 --> 00:17:01,917
Remember, guys,
you're still goodwill ambassadors...

321
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:03,759
We weren't talking to you.

322
00:17:04,487 --> 00:17:06,284
Okay.

323
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:12,680
- Everything okay, Dr. Crane?
- Absolutely.

324
00:17:12,847 --> 00:17:15,884
I didn't fully appreciate the hard-hitting
nature of your journalism,

325
00:17:16,047 --> 00:17:17,844
but I think I know
how to handle it now.

326
00:17:18,007 --> 00:17:19,599
We're back with more <i>Teen Scene,</i>

327
00:17:19,767 --> 00:17:21,837
and our special guest,
Dr. Frasier Crane.

328
00:17:22,247 --> 00:17:24,203
Now, Dr. Crane, where were we?

329
00:17:24,367 --> 00:17:26,039
I believe we were discussing
my competence

330
00:17:26,207 --> 00:17:28,402
as a mental-health professional.

331
00:17:28,727 --> 00:17:32,276
And though it is true
that I have suffered

332
00:17:32,447 --> 00:17:35,041
several emotional setbacks
in my life,

333
00:17:35,207 --> 00:17:38,677
if we are to be honest,
haven't we all?

334
00:17:38,847 --> 00:17:40,838
And that's your defence?
That we all have problems?

335
00:17:41,007 --> 00:17:42,838
[ALL SCOFF]

336
00:17:43,887 --> 00:17:49,723
Perhaps I can better illustrate my point
by reading from a poem entitled:

337
00:17:49,887 --> 00:17:52,879
"An Onion for Trisha."

338
00:17:53,047 --> 00:17:54,116
Where did you get that?

339
00:17:54,287 --> 00:17:56,926
<i>My heart is like an onion</i>

340
00:17:57,447 --> 00:17:59,403
<i>Filled with layers of tears</i>

341
00:17:59,567 --> 00:18:03,276
<i>Why, oh, why did you leave me,</i>
<i>Trisha?</i>

342
00:18:03,447 --> 00:18:05,199
- Okay, give me that!
- Trisha Sharpe?

343
00:18:05,367 --> 00:18:06,800
You said you never liked her.

344
00:18:06,967 --> 00:18:09,765
Ooh, Trent, tough blow!

345
00:18:11,727 --> 00:18:14,036
Yes, it seems
that youthful relationships

346
00:18:14,207 --> 00:18:17,597
are fraught with emotional hazards.

347
00:18:17,767 --> 00:18:20,486
Especially in the case
of a young woman

348
00:18:20,647 --> 00:18:24,526
who finds her first love
at math camp.

349
00:18:25,767 --> 00:18:28,122
- What happened at math camp?
- I don't wanna talk about it.

350
00:18:28,287 --> 00:18:30,642
- Uh, Dr. Crane...
- Yes, Ryan,

351
00:18:30,807 --> 00:18:33,401
or as the boys
on the swim team call you...

352
00:18:33,567 --> 00:18:37,196
So do you have any good advice
for kids that wanna go to college?

353
00:18:38,807 --> 00:18:41,275
As a matter of fact, I believe I do.

354
00:18:43,807 --> 00:18:47,641
In short, caller,
there is nothing wrong with you.

355
00:18:47,847 --> 00:18:50,645
And you're not going to get sick.

356
00:18:50,807 --> 00:18:54,322
But remember,
the more frequently you do it,

357
00:18:54,487 --> 00:18:57,240
the less special it becomes.

358
00:19:00,047 --> 00:19:01,639
I hope that answers your question.

359
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:05,004
MAN [OVER PHONE]:
<i>Uh, yeah. Well, uh, thanks a lot.</i>

360
00:19:05,167 --> 00:19:08,523
Well, that about wraps it up
for tonight's <i>Teen Scene.</i>

361
00:19:08,687 --> 00:19:11,759
For Trent, Ryan and Emily,
this is Andy McNiff,

362
00:19:11,927 --> 00:19:16,364
reminding you we're still taking
applications for the moderator's job,

363
00:19:17,007 --> 00:19:19,601
and wishing you a teen-tastic week.

364
00:19:19,767 --> 00:19:21,359
Good night.

365
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:25,281
- Thanks, kids. I had fun.
- Yeah, thanks.

366
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:28,963
Thank you. You made my month.

367
00:19:29,127 --> 00:19:30,719
[CHUCKLES]

368
00:19:32,167 --> 00:19:36,001
Way to go, Dr. Crane!
That was sweet.

369
00:19:36,167 --> 00:19:37,964
I'm not exactly
proud of myself, Kirby.

370
00:19:38,127 --> 00:19:40,357
You should be, man.
Those dinks brought it on themselves.

371
00:19:40,527 --> 00:19:42,404
They were like,
"We're gonna get this old dude."

372
00:19:42,567 --> 00:19:45,400
And then you were like,
"Old dude? Say what?" And it was like:

373
00:19:45,567 --> 00:19:48,877
Wham! Wham! Smack-down!
Boom! Boom! Doc...

374
00:19:49,247 --> 00:19:51,715
Well said, Kirby. Uh...

375
00:19:52,367 --> 00:19:54,198
And thank you for helping me out.

376
00:19:54,367 --> 00:19:57,916
By the way,
how did you dig up all that stuff?

377
00:19:58,087 --> 00:20:02,478
Oh, let's just say I got a few
operatives who were, uh, held back.

378
00:20:02,647 --> 00:20:04,000
Ah. Heh-heh-heh.

379
00:20:04,167 --> 00:20:07,557
KIRBY: Hey, you know, why don't
you and I continue this conversation

380
00:20:07,727 --> 00:20:11,640
over a cheeseburger or some such?

381
00:20:11,807 --> 00:20:14,116
FRASIER:
I'd like that very much.
