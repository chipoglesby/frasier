It's for his spelling bee tomorrow.

She'll be watching the competition

So, what is this anyway?

It's a flattened penny.
I found it at the railroad tracks once

by this spelling-bee thing, all right?

But we'll be there in spirit, ha, ha.

69

considering how emotional I get

Keep thinking
how much it means to them.

72

Like the little girl who studies
over candlelight

while her father's down at the pub

drinking away the money
for the light bill, ha, ha.

waving at her from the pub.

Then there's the little girl
who thinks that by doing well,

78
00:03:55,487 --> 00:03:57,637
she can grow up,
purchase the local pub

79

and turn it into a circus so her father
can keep his promise.

by all the glitz and glamour of the bee.

right out of elementary school,

00:16:05,487 --> 00:16:07,239
You know how to spell.

311
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:12,162
And it doesn't matter
what anybody else thinks.

312
00:16:14,887 --> 00:16:16,639
Hey, hey,
don't you want your ice cream?

313
00:16:16,807 --> 00:16:20,356
No. I have a banquet to go to.

314
00:16:24,007 --> 00:16:27,477
- Ah, here we are.
- Hi, Amanda.

315
00:16:32,287 --> 00:16:34,437
Never mind her, Freddie.

316
00:16:34,607 --> 00:16:36,563
It's her problem, not yours.

317
00:16:37,007 --> 00:16:39,043
You didn't do anything wrong.

318
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:41,960
I know. Neither did you.

319
00:16:44,167 --> 00:16:45,236
Excuse me.

320
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:48,366
GADSTON:
Good evening.

321
00:16:48,527 --> 00:16:50,722
I'd like to take this opportunity
to welcome you

322
00:16:50,887 --> 00:16:54,402
to this year's annual Spell-a-bration.

323
00:16:55,927 --> 00:16:58,680
Because of the irregularities
with this year's event,

324
00:16:59,127 --> 00:17:02,358
this gathering has been renamed
the Unity Dinner

325
00:17:02,527 --> 00:17:05,246
and is in honour of all the finalists.

326
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:10,763
What is that supposed to mean,
"irregularities"?

327
00:17:10,927 --> 00:17:13,236
Frasier, Frasier, let it go.

328
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:16,126
Crane, no hard feelings.

329
00:17:17,807 --> 00:17:21,277
- No feelings at all.
- Oh, don't be like that.

330
00:17:21,447 --> 00:17:23,802
You're not the first person
tempted to get around the rules.

331
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:25,002
You just got caught.

332
00:17:25,887 --> 00:17:27,843
I did not get caught.

333
00:17:28,007 --> 00:17:30,601
Well, cameras never lie
and cheaters never prosper.

334
00:17:30,767 --> 00:17:33,440
- And you never shut up.
NILES: Frasier, Frasier,

335
00:17:33,607 --> 00:17:36,519
let's try to follow Frederick's example
and carry ourselves with dignity.

336
00:17:36,687 --> 00:17:38,245
SECURITY GUARD:
Where are your parents?

337
00:17:38,407 --> 00:17:40,637
FRASIER:
Freddie? What's going on?

338
00:17:40,807 --> 00:17:42,559
I caught these two fighting
in the men's room.

339
00:17:42,727 --> 00:17:44,240
- He punched me.
FRASIER: Is this true?

340
00:17:44,407 --> 00:17:45,601
He deserved it.

341
00:17:47,287 --> 00:17:49,596
Why'd you do it, Freddie?

342
00:17:50,247 --> 00:17:53,205
- He called my dad a cheater.
- You were defending me?

343
00:17:53,367 --> 00:17:55,676
- Where's your blazer?
- It's in the bathroom.

344
00:17:55,847 --> 00:17:58,680
Oh, dear. If it's touched the floor,
we'll have to destroy it.

345
00:17:59,767 --> 00:18:01,883
Freddie, I want you to apologise
to Warren right now.

346
00:18:02,047 --> 00:18:03,878
Yes, and then, Warren,
you apologise too.

347
00:18:04,047 --> 00:18:06,766
Being a name-caller is almost as bad
as being a cheater.

348
00:18:06,927 --> 00:18:10,203
I am not a cheater. You are a thief.

349
00:18:10,367 --> 00:18:13,165
- My son is the true champion.
- Yeah, when your dad's here to help.

350
00:18:13,327 --> 00:18:15,682
Hey, I can out-spell you any time,
any place.

351
00:18:15,847 --> 00:18:17,519
Oh, yeah? How about right now?

352
00:18:17,687 --> 00:18:19,917
[STAMMERS] Hold on, son.
We don't have to prove anything.

353
00:18:20,087 --> 00:18:23,159
- I can take you in five words.
- Okay, you're on. For the trophy.

354
00:18:23,327 --> 00:18:25,887
Why? We already have the trophy.
Ha, ha.

355
00:18:26,047 --> 00:18:29,164
Crane, why don't you talk some sense
into your boy there?

356
00:18:29,767 --> 00:18:33,521
- Freddie...
- Dad, I wanna spell.

357
00:18:38,247 --> 00:18:41,637
What's the matter, John?
You scared?

358
00:18:41,807 --> 00:18:43,206
[CROWD MUTTERING]

359
00:18:45,727 --> 00:18:46,716
For the trophy.

360
00:18:46,887 --> 00:18:49,117
We have already selected
an official winner.

361
00:18:49,287 --> 00:18:51,403
If you would like to brawl,
take it someplace else.

362
00:18:51,567 --> 00:18:54,400
- Let's take it outside.
FRASIER: To the street.

363
00:18:57,727 --> 00:19:00,400
Sudden death.
Scripps Howard rules.

364
00:19:00,567 --> 00:19:03,718
- Bring it on.
- People, stop, please.

365
00:19:03,887 --> 00:19:05,718
Look at yourselves.

366
00:19:06,927 --> 00:19:08,883
This is wrong.

367
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:11,515
What are words, after all,
but a way to communicate,

368
00:19:11,687 --> 00:19:13,040
to bring us together?

369
00:19:13,207 --> 00:19:16,404
But you...
You're using them as weapons.

370
00:19:18,807 --> 00:19:22,356
Now, we still have an opportunity
to walk away from here as winners.

371
00:19:22,527 --> 00:19:26,156
And wouldn't that be the greatest
spell-a-bration of all?

372
00:19:29,727 --> 00:19:33,561
He's right, son. Let's go home.

373
00:19:34,687 --> 00:19:37,326
Yeah. We're all winners,
except for the two cheaters.

374
00:19:40,127 --> 00:19:43,324
Hey, you know how to spell loser?
C-R-A-N-E.

375
00:19:46,127 --> 00:19:48,004
You don't have to worry
about seeing him again.

376
00:19:48,167 --> 00:19:49,964
Chances are he'll end up
in a state school.

377
00:19:53,967 --> 00:19:56,640
How dare you.

378
00:19:57,687 --> 00:19:59,518
- Can you take him?
- Yeah.

379
00:19:59,687 --> 00:20:02,247
Then spell his ass off.
