I found the staff here
very knowledgeable.

158
00:07:48,327 --> 00:07:50,477
Well, yes.
All right, all right. I'll be right there.

159
00:07:50,647 --> 00:07:51,875
Yes. Ah, excuse me.

160
00:07:52,047 --> 00:07:55,881
Um, do you happen to have a book
on the Plantagenets?

161
00:07:56,087 --> 00:07:58,442
That's like a banana, right?

162
00:08:00,527 --> 00:08:02,006
Never mind.

163
00:08:02,167 --> 00:08:03,998
- Any luck?
- Finding dunderheads, yes.

164
00:08:04,167 --> 00:08:05,998
Oh, well, maybe you should ask
someone else.

165
00:08:06,167 --> 00:08:08,283
- All right.
- Can I help the next person?

166
00:08:08,487 --> 00:08:11,399
- Or maybe we should just pay and go.
- Niles, we just got here.

167
00:08:11,567 --> 00:08:13,842
- You are acting very strangely.
- No, I'm not.

168
00:08:15,847 --> 00:08:18,281
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- I'm sorry... Dizzy spells.

169
00:08:18,487 --> 00:08:21,160
There's a footstool in the Shakespeare
section. Go have a seat.

170
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:23,198
- I'll be fine. You just pay.
- Yes, of course.

171
00:08:23,367 --> 00:08:26,757
- Clark, can you take over?
- Sure.

172
00:08:28,807 --> 00:08:30,081
CLARK: Hello, again.
- Yes, hello.

173
00:08:30,247 --> 00:08:33,000
- Did you find what you're looking for?
- Not really, no.

174
00:08:33,207 --> 00:08:35,198
Okay.

175
00:08:35,407 --> 00:08:36,726
Oh, I have Book-Lover's discount.

176
00:08:36,887 --> 00:08:38,240
Ah, we don't accept that.

177
00:08:38,407 --> 00:08:40,716
- Independent Booksellers?
- No.

178
00:08:41,607 --> 00:08:43,359
Bibliophiles?

179
00:08:43,527 --> 00:08:45,245
Dewey Decimal discount?

180
00:08:45,407 --> 00:08:46,522
Dust Jacket Gang?

181
00:08:46,727 --> 00:08:49,400
I'm sorry.
We do have our own card. It's $25.

182
00:08:49,607 --> 00:08:51,199
Twenty-five doll...? For a little card?

183
00:08:51,407 --> 00:08:53,716
You get 15 percent off all purchases.

184
00:08:54,687 --> 00:08:55,961
Very well.

185
00:08:56,127 --> 00:08:57,879
How much will I save today?

186
00:08:58,087 --> 00:08:59,839
The discount starts
with your next purchase.

187
00:09:00,047 --> 00:09:02,880
What? What kind of a Ponzi scheme
are you operating here?

188
00:09:03,047 --> 00:09:04,765
CLARK:
Store policy.

189
00:09:04,927 --> 00:09:06,519
I would like to speak
with the storeowner.

190
00:09:06,687 --> 00:09:07,676
Whoa. What's going on?

191
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:09,678
I'm gonna give the owner
a piece of my mind.

192
00:09:09,847 --> 00:09:11,803
- Forget it. I don't want the book.
- Yes, you do.

193
00:09:11,967 --> 00:09:14,083
- I don't.
- You're getting the book and a discount.

194
00:09:14,247 --> 00:09:16,363
Lisa, we have a card challenge
at checkout.

195
00:09:16,567 --> 00:09:19,206
- No, no, no. Challenge withdrawn.
- Over my protest.

196
00:09:19,367 --> 00:09:20,959
No, no. We're leaving.
Everything's okay.

197
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:23,800
All right, all right. By the way,
you have an alphabetical misfile,

198
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:26,197
but I'm not telling you where.

199
00:09:29,927 --> 00:09:31,246
[ELEVATOR DOOR OPENS]

200
00:09:31,407 --> 00:09:33,637
ROZ: I just know the two of you
are gonna hit it off.

201
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:36,275
I thought you were always complaining
he's such a tight-ass.

202
00:09:36,447 --> 00:09:39,007
Not complaining. Bragging.

203
00:09:39,167 --> 00:09:43,763
You know? That I work with someone
who's got such a tight ass.

204
00:09:44,647 --> 00:09:47,036
Frasier, Susanna.
Susanna, this is Frasier.

205
00:09:47,207 --> 00:09:49,084
Come on in.
Uh, Roz has told me all about you.

206
00:09:49,247 --> 00:09:50,839
She told me all about you too.

207
00:09:51,047 --> 00:09:53,515
I thought since you were
making dinner, I'd add a contribution.

208
00:09:53,687 --> 00:09:55,803
It's nothing special,
just a key lime pie.

209
00:09:56,007 --> 00:09:57,486
"Nothing special."

210
00:09:57,647 --> 00:10:01,606
She made the whole thing herself
from scratch. The crust, the meringue.

211
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:06,158
She even baked it in a pie plate
she fired in her own home kiln.

212
00:10:07,287 --> 00:10:11,485
In my spare time, I use
my power of invisibility to fight crime.

213
00:10:11,687 --> 00:10:13,484
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Am I overselling this a little?

214
00:10:13,647 --> 00:10:14,921
FRASIER:
Just a bit, yes, Roz.

215
00:10:15,127 --> 00:10:17,595
I'll just go put this in the kitchen.
Ha, ha.

216
00:10:17,767 --> 00:10:19,883
Why don't you ladies
make yourselves comfortable?

217
00:10:25,247 --> 00:10:27,966
- Would anyone care for some wine?
SUSANNA: Thank you. Sure.

218
00:10:28,167 --> 00:10:30,727
Frasier knows pretty much everything
there is to know about wine.

219
00:10:30,887 --> 00:10:34,516
Tell us some things
about wine, Frasier.

220
00:10:36,207 --> 00:10:39,677
Sometimes you have to know
when to put a cork in it.

221
00:10:41,087 --> 00:10:43,317
- So, Roz, where's Roger?
- I don't know.

222
00:10:43,487 --> 00:10:45,557
I'll call him
and see what's holding him up.

223
00:10:45,727 --> 00:10:47,877
You know, Susanna,
now would be a good time

224
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:50,197
to show Frasier your portfolio.

225
00:10:50,367 --> 00:10:51,959
- Susanna's an artist.
- Oh.

226
00:10:52,167 --> 00:10:55,603
She even has a gallery
that shows her paintings exclusively.

227
00:10:55,767 --> 00:10:58,918
It's not so much a gallery
as a restaurant-slash-bowling alley.

228
00:10:59,887 --> 00:11:02,685
She's a hell of a bowler too.

229
00:11:02,847 --> 00:11:05,964
Someone better snatch her up
before she joins a league

230
00:11:06,127 --> 00:11:08,800
and there go her Saturday nights.

231
00:11:10,887 --> 00:11:13,640
Roz, go make your call, all right?

232
00:11:14,287 --> 00:11:16,755
- Here we are.
- Thank you.

233
00:11:17,087 --> 00:11:20,443
I don't usually travel with my portfolio,
but she made me bring it.

234
00:11:20,607 --> 00:11:23,075
I'm glad she did. I actually fancy myself
a bit of a collector.

235
00:11:23,247 --> 00:11:25,044
- I'd love to see it.
- Oh, all right.

236
00:11:25,207 --> 00:11:28,005
- But be gentle.
- Of course.

237
00:11:31,207 --> 00:11:33,243
Oh, my.

238
00:11:33,407 --> 00:11:35,716
Well, that is interesting.
It's quite remarkable, really.

239
00:11:35,887 --> 00:11:39,402
Thanks. The original's
hanging over the shoe rental.

240
00:11:42,567 --> 00:11:44,603
Wonderful texture.

241
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:46,962
And these blues.

242
00:11:47,287 --> 00:11:48,402
So much sadness.

243
00:11:49,527 --> 00:11:51,961
Most people don't get that.

244
00:11:52,887 --> 00:11:56,436
Yes, and your elongated figures
are actually reminiscent of Modigliani.

245
00:11:56,647 --> 00:11:58,922
That's interesting.
I used to love Modigliani as a girl.

246
00:11:59,087 --> 00:12:00,520
Maybe I was
subconsciously influenced.

247
00:12:00,687 --> 00:12:01,676
Quite possibly, yes.

248
00:12:01,847 --> 00:12:03,963
I see you're also a fan
of Benjamin Locklear.

249
00:12:04,127 --> 00:12:05,879
- What?
- Benjamin Locklear has a show...

250
00:12:06,047 --> 00:12:08,925
I know who he is.
His stuff isn't anything like mine.

251
00:12:09,127 --> 00:12:10,845
Maybe you haven't seen
his latest work.

252
00:12:11,007 --> 00:12:14,204
You see, I was just in attendance
at his most recent opening.

253
00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:18,599
I purchased a fantastic piece myself.
Here, let me show you.

254
00:12:18,767 --> 00:12:20,166
Hmm?

255
00:12:20,327 --> 00:12:21,840
- My God.
- It's magnificent, isn't it?

256
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:24,919
You know, I'm thinking of putting it
in my bedroom to set off the duvet.

257
00:12:25,087 --> 00:12:26,759
That hack ripped me off.

258
00:12:26,967 --> 00:12:29,003
- That's quite an accusation.
- The guy is a thief.

259
00:12:29,167 --> 00:12:30,680
Everyone in the art community
knows it.

260
00:12:30,887 --> 00:12:32,764
I consider myself a member
of the art community.

261
00:12:32,927 --> 00:12:34,724
- All I've heard is good things.
- Oh, please.

262
00:12:34,927 --> 00:12:36,485
The guy steals
from lesser-known artists

263
00:12:36,647 --> 00:12:39,081
and markets himself to suckers
with more money than taste.

264
00:12:45,087 --> 00:12:46,725
You know what?

265
00:12:46,887 --> 00:12:48,320
You're right.

266
00:12:48,487 --> 00:12:50,523
Maybe he did copy you.

267
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:52,405
Maybe he got
his inspiration one evening

268
00:12:52,567 --> 00:12:56,037
when he was out bowling
a few frames.

269
00:12:56,247 --> 00:13:00,160
I do not need to be insulted
by someone who buys art

270
00:13:00,327 --> 00:13:02,204
because it matches his bedspread.

271
00:13:02,367 --> 00:13:04,005
It's a duvet, and you're delusional.

272
00:13:04,207 --> 00:13:05,640
- Dilettante.
- Forger.

273
00:13:05,847 --> 00:13:07,838
Man who uses the word "duvet."

274
00:13:12,127 --> 00:13:14,083
Hey, guys, how's it going?

275
00:13:14,487 --> 00:13:17,081
- She is crazy, that's how it's going.
- And for your information,

276
00:13:17,247 --> 00:13:21,286
Benjamin Locklear
is as overrated as your ass.

277
00:13:24,567 --> 00:13:28,560
- What was that supposed to mean?
- I have no idea. Have a nice weekend.

278
00:13:29,287 --> 00:13:31,437
- What's going on out here?
- Oh.

279
00:13:31,967 --> 00:13:35,721
I let Roz set me up on a blind date
with one of her friends.

280
00:13:35,927 --> 00:13:37,280
Big waste of time, huh?

281
00:13:37,487 --> 00:13:40,081
- Well, there's pie.
- Ooh.

282
00:13:40,287 --> 00:13:42,005
- Homemade?
- Yep.

283
00:13:42,167 --> 00:13:43,646
- Cherry?
- Key lime.

284
00:13:44,127 --> 00:13:45,321
I can live with that.

285
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:49,205
Sorry, son. Tough break.

286
00:13:49,367 --> 00:13:52,677
Oh, I bet it's got a lard crust. Ooh.

287
00:13:55,527 --> 00:13:57,836
- Brought you a fork, Dad.
- Oh, thanks.

288
00:13:58,047 --> 00:14:00,038
I wish I'd never let Roz set me up
on that date.

289
00:14:00,207 --> 00:14:03,836
Well, you know, you can't hit the ball
unless you take a swing. Oh.

290
00:14:04,047 --> 00:14:06,038
Now, there's this gal
at the building where I work.

291
00:14:06,207 --> 00:14:08,004
Dad. You're not proposing
another blind date.

292
00:14:08,167 --> 00:14:11,603
Now, she's a beautiful young lawyer,
and she couldn't be nicer.

293
00:14:11,807 --> 00:14:13,798
- I am not interested.
- Well, now, don't say that.

294
00:14:13,967 --> 00:14:15,480
- You gotta see her.
- Dad...

295
00:14:15,647 --> 00:14:17,239
Frasier, listen to me.

296
00:14:18,687 --> 00:14:21,042
You gotta see her.

297
00:14:22,927 --> 00:14:24,440
A young lawyer, you say?

298
00:14:30,047 --> 00:14:32,322
KRIS: Thanks for meeting me here.
- Sure.

299
00:14:32,527 --> 00:14:35,360
I thought it would be nice
to have a drink before dinner.

300
00:14:35,527 --> 00:14:37,404
I don't think
I've ever really been here before,

301
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:39,842
but it does have
a nice sort of neighbourhood feel to it.

302
00:14:40,007 --> 00:14:41,486
It is my favourite place.

303
00:14:41,687 --> 00:14:42,676
Ah.

304
00:14:42,847 --> 00:14:44,997
So my dad tells me
that you're a lawyer.

305
00:14:45,207 --> 00:14:47,004
Actually, I'm a legal secretary,

306
00:14:47,167 --> 00:14:49,965
but I'm planning
to go to law school next fall.

307
00:14:50,167 --> 00:14:51,759
Well, that's admirable. Thank you.

308
00:14:52,447 --> 00:14:57,077
