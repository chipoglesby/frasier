Our topic today has been honesty.

2
00:00:10,887 --> 00:00:14,960
The courage to face each other
with the plain truth.

3
00:00:15,127 --> 00:00:17,118
I've certainly enjoyed myself
these last few hours.

I hope you have too.

5
00:00:18,807 --> 00:00:23,597
This is Dr. Frasier Crane
wishing you good mental health.

6
00:00:24,687 --> 00:00:26,917
Well, that was a dog of a show.

7
00:00:28,407 --> 00:00:30,125
They all blend.

8
00:00:30,287 --> 00:00:34,326
Oh, you got a message.
A Blaine Sternin called.

9
00:00:35,567 --> 00:00:36,761
Blaine Sternin.

10
00:00:37,727 --> 00:00:40,002
Call him back, tell him I'm dead.

11
00:00:41,287 --> 00:00:43,517
Sternin. Is he related to Lilith?

12
00:00:43,687 --> 00:00:47,362
Yes. He's Lilith's half brother,
the curse of the family.

13
00:00:47,527 --> 00:00:49,995
What does it say
when Lilith is the good one?

14
00:00:50,167 --> 00:00:51,725
He sounded charming on the phone.

15
00:00:51,887 --> 00:00:53,957
Well, of course
he sounded charming.

16
00:00:54,127 --> 00:00:58,803
Charm is the viscous grease with
which he oils his flimflam machine.

17
00:00:58,967 --> 00:01:00,878
The man will say anything
to get what he wants.

I can't believe
I haven't dated this guy.

19
00:01:04,127 --> 00:01:06,925
The only reason he'd be contacting me
is to separate me from my money.

20
00:01:07,087 --> 00:01:09,555
The man is always coming up
with some... Some sucker sob story

while he's busy living the highlife
in Laughlin, Nevada.

22

You know, he once stole from me

- Who?
- Lilith's half brother.

31
00:01:53,687 --> 00:01:56,838
Is he the scoundrel that walked off
with your 18th-century saltcellar?

32

for you this afternoon.

I believe that was the name
on the return address.

00:02:05,807 --> 00:02:07,763
What could he possibly
be sending me?

- No, from the Highway Department.

Hang in there, sweetheart.
You'll get one.

He showed me
how I'd squandered my life.

The fact that Mr. Sternin has turned
his accident into something positive.

00:08:14,447 --> 00:08:16,642
Kelp futures.

157
00:08:18,527 --> 00:08:20,165
Aren't you rushing to judgement,
Frasier?

158
00:08:20,327 --> 00:08:24,320
L... I know you two have a history,
but isn't it possible that he's changed?

159
00:08:24,487 --> 00:08:26,637
Oh, don't be a sucker, Niles.

160
00:08:26,807 --> 00:08:29,116
Dad, you're not buying
any of this medicine show, are you?

161
00:08:29,287 --> 00:08:31,403
Well, the guy is
laying it on pretty thick.

162
00:08:31,567 --> 00:08:36,561
But I guess he could be on the level.
I mean, that pin thing was freaky.

163
00:08:36,927 --> 00:08:39,122
I want to get that on video.

164
00:08:40,527 --> 00:08:42,358
Daphne, you left him alone
in the kitchen?

165
00:08:42,527 --> 00:08:45,963
My Sub-Zero's probably
on the way to a chop shop right now.

166
00:08:46,247 --> 00:08:48,681
All right, Blaine. I've had enough.
Get out.

167
00:08:48,847 --> 00:08:50,917
Frasier, look, I don't know how
to prove this to you.

168
00:08:51,087 --> 00:08:53,476
But I swear, all I really came for
was your forgiveness,

169
00:08:53,647 --> 00:08:55,524
first of all,
for stealing that little teapot.

170
00:08:55,687 --> 00:08:57,803
Salt server.

171
00:08:57,967 --> 00:09:01,004
Is that what that was?
Man, nobody knew.

172
00:09:01,167 --> 00:09:03,806
And for all the times I lied
and I cheated you.

173
00:09:03,967 --> 00:09:06,879
And for the time I posed as you
and treated patients for a year.

174
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:08,400
- What?
- Only a couple of people.

175
00:09:08,567 --> 00:09:12,116
I'd tell you who they were, but I've got
that doctor-patient confidentiality thing.

176
00:09:12,287 --> 00:09:14,243
The point is,
that part of my life is over.

177
00:09:14,407 --> 00:09:16,682
I just... I don't know.
I just want to give something back.

178
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:18,678
Really? If you wanted
to give something back,

179
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:22,123
you'd be mopping a soup kitchen
or reading to bedridden vets,

180
00:09:22,287 --> 00:09:26,724
or travelling to the Galápagos Islands
to clean oil off some poor seafowl.

181
00:09:26,887 --> 00:09:28,445
Then maybe
you'd have some credibility.

182
00:09:28,607 --> 00:09:30,882
I know I've given you so many reasons
to mistrust me.

183
00:09:31,047 --> 00:09:33,481
But don't you believe
that people can change?

184
00:09:34,847 --> 00:09:38,965
If I forgive you,
will you leave and never return?

185
00:09:39,127 --> 00:09:41,721
Yes. I promise you you'll never see
my face in this house again,

186
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:43,525
unless I'm invited.

187
00:09:45,047 --> 00:09:48,642
Very well.
I grant you this boon, and I forgive you.

188
00:09:48,807 --> 00:09:50,365
Now get out.

189
00:09:50,527 --> 00:09:53,246
Oh, Mr. Sternin,
I hope you'll stay for dinner.

190
00:09:56,407 --> 00:09:58,159
Sounds like an invitation to me, Fras.

191
00:10:03,407 --> 00:10:06,444
And so here's this kid,
no more than 15 years old.

192
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:09,360
He lives in a cardboard box
under the overpass.

193
00:10:09,527 --> 00:10:11,438
And his mother comes to me
and begs me:

194
00:10:11,607 --> 00:10:13,006
"Will you get my kid off drugs?"

195
00:10:13,167 --> 00:10:15,397
Yes, yes, and then you cured him.
Let's eat.

196
00:10:15,567 --> 00:10:18,684
No, no, no. You don't cure something
like addiction overnight.

197
00:10:18,847 --> 00:10:21,839
Well, look who I'm telling. I mean,
you're a psychiatrist, you know.

198
00:10:22,007 --> 00:10:23,884
Well, that's true.
I have found in my research

199
00:10:24,047 --> 00:10:25,958
with addictive personalities that...

200
00:10:26,127 --> 00:10:28,322
Oh, for God's sake,
what the hell am I doing?

201
00:10:28,487 --> 00:10:31,081
- There probably is no kid anyway.
- Come on, let up on the guy.

202
00:10:31,247 --> 00:10:32,919
He's a man of God.

203
00:10:33,567 --> 00:10:36,843
Blaine, can I take a picture of you
with a fork in your leg?

204
00:10:39,047 --> 00:10:41,686
- All right, everybody. Dig in.
- Oh, right.

205
00:10:41,847 --> 00:10:44,156
- Thank you, Daphne.
- Oh, beautiful, Daphne.

206
00:10:44,327 --> 00:10:48,286
- Thank you, darling.
- Well, who wants to say grace?

207
00:10:48,607 --> 00:10:50,996
Oh, we almost forgot.

208
00:10:51,167 --> 00:10:53,283
Whose turn is it this time?

209
00:10:54,607 --> 00:10:56,245
Okay, I will.
Would you all join hands?

210
00:10:56,407 --> 00:10:57,886
Yes.

211
00:11:04,167 --> 00:11:05,646
Ready.

212
00:11:06,607 --> 00:11:09,167
Dear Lord, bless this food
and this company.

213
00:11:09,327 --> 00:11:11,477
Give us your guidance,
and teach us to be forgiving,

214
00:11:11,647 --> 00:11:13,319
as you instructed your apostles.

215
00:11:13,487 --> 00:11:17,116
I'll give you 50 bucks
if you can name three of them.

216
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:19,201
- Frasier.
FRASIER: Here you go.

217
00:11:19,367 --> 00:11:23,280
Two 20's and a 10.
Tell you what, I'll spot you John.

218
00:11:23,647 --> 00:11:26,207
Dr. Crane,
we're in the middle of a prayer.

219
00:11:26,367 --> 00:11:27,641
Please, go on.

220
00:11:30,087 --> 00:11:33,079
- Thank you, Lord. Amen.
ALL: Amen.

221
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,646
Amen.

222
00:11:34,807 --> 00:11:38,322
You know, normally I get paid
after I say grace.

223
00:11:39,527 --> 00:11:41,483
Oh, I'm kidding. Ha, ha!

224
00:11:41,647 --> 00:11:43,160
He was kidding. That was funny.

225
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:44,965
[CHUCKLING]

226
00:11:45,127 --> 00:11:47,846
You know, you're a godless bunch,
but I love you.

227
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:49,235
[LAUGHTER]

228
00:11:49,407 --> 00:11:50,840
You know,
even worse than the godless

229
00:11:51,007 --> 00:11:52,884
are those who would use God
for their own gain.

230
00:11:53,047 --> 00:11:54,844
They are the true hypocrites

231
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:58,044
who should burn in the fiery hell
for all eternity.

232
00:12:00,247 --> 00:12:02,715
Am I picking up a vibe here?

233
00:12:03,167 --> 00:12:05,840
Oh, I'm sorry.
Did you think that was directed at you?

234
00:12:06,447 --> 00:12:08,961
You know, I could quote you
chapter and verse all night

235
00:12:09,127 --> 00:12:11,118
to try to prove to you
that I'm a changed man.

236
00:12:11,287 --> 00:12:12,276
But you know what?

237
00:12:12,447 --> 00:12:16,201
Instead, why don't you come see me
in action on Sunday?

238
00:12:16,367 --> 00:12:17,436
What do you mean?

239
00:12:17,607 --> 00:12:18,642
Come and hear me preach.

240
00:12:18,807 --> 00:12:21,560
Witness what God can do
through me in all his splendour

241
00:12:21,727 --> 00:12:23,160
and all his glory
in the Regency Room

242
00:12:23,327 --> 00:12:25,477
down the at the airport Ramada.

243
00:12:26,847 --> 00:12:28,280
- I'd love to go.
- I wouldn't mind.

244
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:30,119
- Sure, why not?
BLAINE: Bless you people.

245
00:12:30,287 --> 00:12:31,959
That's just great.
Thank you very much.

246
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:34,846
Only problem is, the advertising
was just a skosh more than I thought,

247
00:12:35,007 --> 00:12:37,282
and I came up about $1000 short
on the hall rental.

248
00:12:37,447 --> 00:12:38,960
Aha!

249
00:12:39,127 --> 00:12:43,006
The other shoe comes cascading
from the sky.

250
00:12:43,167 --> 00:12:44,395
One thousand dollars you say.

251
00:12:44,567 --> 00:12:48,003
You're not getting it out of me, you
born-again Bilko. Didn't I tell you?

252
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:50,681
Fras, you know,
what I was going to say,

253
00:12:50,847 --> 00:12:52,326
if you'd let me finish was,

254
00:12:52,487 --> 00:12:54,876
- somehow the Lord will provide.
- Oh.

255
00:12:55,047 --> 00:12:58,005
And by the way, Matthew, John,
Thomas, Bartholomew, Jude, Judas,

256
00:12:58,167 --> 00:13:02,001
two Jameses, Andrew, Peter,
Simon the Zealot and Philip.

257
00:13:02,167 --> 00:13:05,842
Nine-fifty to go.
Pass the potatoes, please.

258
00:13:11,367 --> 00:13:13,927
FRASIER: He says the Lord
will provide the money.

259
00:13:14,087 --> 00:13:17,124
But we all know who that means.
Me.

260
00:13:17,527 --> 00:13:20,644
You know, I've always had a thing
for evangelists.

261
00:13:20,807 --> 00:13:24,641
When I first started out, I worked
at this station back in Wisconsin,

262
00:13:24,807 --> 00:13:26,718
and there was this young preacher

263
00:13:26,887 --> 00:13:29,606
who had a show of his own
on Sunday mornings.

264
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:32,361
He spent hours
trying to save my soul.

265
00:13:32,527 --> 00:13:33,721
[LAUGHS]

266
00:13:33,887 --> 00:13:35,206
And?

267
00:13:35,367 --> 00:13:38,598
And it worked. And now I'm a nun.
What do you think happened?

268
00:13:41,407 --> 00:13:42,522
- Hello.
- Oh, Daphne, Niles.

269
00:13:42,687 --> 00:13:43,676
Hi there.

270
00:13:43,847 --> 00:13:45,280
Well, Dr. Crane, you needn't worry

271
00:13:45,447 --> 00:13:47,438
about Blaine
asking you for money anymore.

272
00:13:47,607 --> 00:13:50,041
He's received the $1000
he needs for Sunday.

273
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:53,995
- What nitwit gave him $1000?
- Now, Frasier, that's not fair.

274
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:56,203
Perhaps whoever did it
simply has a kind heart

275
00:13:56,367 --> 00:13:59,598
and a trusting nature that I, for one,
find refreshing.

276
00:14:01,087 --> 00:14:02,964
Oh, Daphne.

277
00:14:03,527 --> 00:14:06,644
I come from a large family
of scoundrels and ne'er-do-wells

278
00:14:06,807 --> 00:14:08,923
who repeatedly promised me
they'd change their ways,

279
00:14:09,087 --> 00:14:10,600
and never made any effort.

280
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:14,077
Now here is someone
who's actually trying and succeeding.

281
00:14:14,247 --> 00:14:16,715
Now, I think that's worthy
of a little encouragement.

282
00:14:16,887 --> 00:14:19,447
- Coffee, Niles? Mm.
- Yes, please.

283
00:14:19,607 --> 00:14:22,917
I can't believe Daphne got snowed
by that crook.

284
00:14:23,447 --> 00:14:26,359
Now, I've got to expose Blaine
for the charlatan that he is.

285
00:14:26,527 --> 00:14:29,883
What was the name of that doctor
he said treated him in Laughlin?

286
00:14:30,047 --> 00:14:32,925
Uh, it was Kagan, if memory serves.
Dr. Kagan.

287
00:14:33,087 --> 00:14:35,396
Shouldn't be too hard to find.

288
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:40,398
[SLOWLY]
Laughlin, Nevada.

289
00:14:43,487 --> 00:14:46,399
Doctor Kagan.

290
00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:48,676
I'm being connected.

291
00:14:48,847 --> 00:14:52,362
Frasier, you're sure
you're not being a tad obsessive?

292
00:14:52,527 --> 00:14:54,722
Niles, this is about the truth.

293
00:14:55,207 --> 00:14:58,643
Yes, hello?
Uh, yes, Dr. Kagan, please?

294
00:14:58,807 --> 00:15:00,286
Busy?

295
00:15:00,447 --> 00:15:03,166
Too busy to talk with
Dr. Frasier Crane

296
00:15:03,327 --> 00:15:06,364
[SWEDISH ACCENT]
From the Nobel Prize Committee?

297
00:15:08,487 --> 00:15:09,522
Now, you may ask yourself,

298
00:15:09,687 --> 00:15:11,837
why would this man
spend the last hour

299
00:15:12,007 --> 00:15:13,076
preaching the word of God?

300
00:15:13,247 --> 00:15:17,798
Look what God did to him.
Well, I'll tell you what God did to me.

301
00:15:17,967 --> 00:15:21,482
He took away my legs
to show me how tall I could stand.

302
00:15:21,647 --> 00:15:23,000
[APPLAUSE]

303
00:15:23,167 --> 00:15:25,476
Because, until this happened,
I was not a whole man.

304
00:15:25,647 --> 00:15:30,004
I was a gambler.
I was a liar. I was a cheat.

305
00:15:30,167 --> 00:15:33,284
Everything you can imagine,
that was me.

306
